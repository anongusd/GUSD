Even with ACA health care in America is:		Twice as expensive, 	Causes many bankruptcies, 	Is 34th in the world for outcomes, and, makes businesses less competitive because in most other developed countries the medical costs are shared by all.
I think this typical billionaire Shultz guy will give the Democrats the perfect way to expose the moral bankruptcy of  Conservatism.		American medical care is twice as expensive,  only covers 80% as most other countries. Supporting the status quo is Way more radical than change.
On the other side when the economy overheats, reduced taxes takes cash out of the economy much more efficiently than increasing interest rates.
If we tie the top tax rate to employment AND economic progress the rich will suffer higher rates when the rest of us suffer economic pain.This would give them incentive to invest (in America) or it give the Government money to create jobs programs when they won't.
Actually, the top tax rate should be a variable tool to replace interest rates to control recessions. Currently when the rest of the economy suffers the rich getting a break. But in bad recessions it's too small to help so they stay on the sidelines. https://t.co/pWXLkFXx4D

Blame for the distorted reputation also falls on Hillary and Democrats in general who make no efforts to defend against false claims. The corrosive long term effect of a right wing vendetta against HRC &amp; Pelosi has made them toxic to even some Democrats. https://t.co/FH9pZlNGlr

Kavanaugh is a political hack of questionable veracity, at best. Yes, he is smart but he is also bigoted and sexist. No further hearings are needed.
I wonder if some of the people using alcohol as an excuse for allowing Cavanagh to get away with this crime would be cool with some guy getting drunk just so they could assault their daughters?
That's really hypocritical considering that Kavanaugh worked for Starr who impeached Clinton because Clinton said getting a BJ wasn't "having sex". Ripping at her clothes and pawing at her breasts wasn't sexual assault unless he scored? Is he giving Bill his Law License back? https://t.co/JUOnFp1zfo
When you look at Kavanaugh's behavior and statements, it would be hard to say that his character is not questionable. Along with his actions in the Bush administration and false statements about them, it seem the nomination is more a partisan reward than an earned honor.

Kavanaugh is an outlier as a nomination as possibly the most partisan actor ever appointed in his career before becoming a judge. His appointment is payback for his disgusting hatchet jobs on the Clintons.
Wow @Lawrence you hit a home run! You might also mention the GOP Congress never acted for a year on voting for Garland. What's the hurry now.
Let the morons confirm that rapist. He will be a placeholder until we get a Democratic President, replace him with Merrick Garland and vacate all the rulings where he was the deciding vote.
Democrats should allow Kavanaugh to be confirmed by Republicans. When they get the Presidency, House and the Senate back they can impeach the guy and put back somebody who is qualified. Like Merrick Garland.

Congratulations, you won. HILLARY isn't President. Jon Bolton is back in power. Authoritarians use wars to stay in power. Your uninformed vote will probably result in the death of one or more of my 4 draft age children.
Hillary was not a perfect candidate but she was smart, learned from her mistakes, and would have been better than any Republican. Students debt,  Health care  women's rights, voters rights Dreamers are all totally screwed thanks to people that believe GOP lies about HRC.
People voting for Stein believed many of the lies about Hillary that have been proven wrong. They were part of a smear be Roger Ailes who was pissed about Nixons's impeachment (HRC was a lawyer for the Prosecution) and by the Scaife's pissed a Bill's retaking Arkansas's Governor.
It not a con job. It's a fact. Own it. If Stein didn't run Trump would not be President. There was a reason the Putin invested in Stein, Sanders &amp; Trump. Stein's take in 2016 was well more than the difference in MI and WI. HRC would NOT have been same or worse. https://t.co/W3cyDZmKkF

@jamestlove2 @MichaelDenesyk @MediocreJedi If you give a break to deer, why not humans. No necked down (usually high velocity) sounds good to me.
@jamestlove2 @MichaelDenesyk @MediocreJedi Your mentioning round limits. I almost got shot by someone trying to catch up with a deer who was violating limits. The shot 4 or 5 rounds on either side of me. Took all the fun out of hunting that day. I would like to see round limits on possession when not in a sporting venue.
@jamestlove2 @MichaelDenesyk @MediocreJedi I can compromise on mags stored at recreational sites and in a locked container, empty with less than 6 rounds in vehicle. Considering the carnage possible, sanctions would have to be significant for violators before I would change my mind.
@politicoroger @missb62 You could have went all day without reminding me of that shit.
@laureldavilacpa @SenFeinstein Democrats! Don't act like Republicans. Don't base your vote on negative things you've heard about people. Vote on what assets that person brings to the job. Youth is an asset but so is experience. Pick the one you want but don't trash the other. It's self defeating.
@jamestlove2 @MichaelDenesyk @MediocreJedi Well, so what. Your insight has been wrong about everything so far.
@MichaelDenesyk @jamestlove2 @MediocreJedi As I replied to jl2, it is a totally different situation. Having an AR could have made that worse. But an accurate sniper in a difficult to approach position is bad either way. It does show a need to limit the number of rounds people may carry.
@jamestlove2 @MichaelDenesyk @MediocreJedi That is not a similar situation. A sniper in a crows nest is entirely different than an armored shooter walking among his victims. The fact that you equate them show how little you understand the subject.

@nytimes @Proudyorkiemom Because their "faith" is just means to obtain a semblance of "authority".

@SevereSociety And then there's the issue that if you have two people shooting at each other most of the bullets are going to miss in that situation kids become backstops.

There's nothing in the 2nd Amendment about personal protection it's about a situation which no longer exists where states protect themselves with militias. Believe it don't believe it when you look at the original intent, that is a fact.

No ARs, no mags over 5 rounds, no carrying an extra mag. No guns that hold the bolt open after the last riud(so it can accept a full magazine rapidly), no guns that can accept an extended magazine, no loaded rifles in urban areas. Gun owners must have training &amp; insurance.

Background checks won't stop even half of the school shootings. No large capacity clips, no military weapons. No semi-auto guns that can accept magazines over 5 rounds. No semi-auto that have actions that stay open on the last round, including pistols (like in InterArms Tech-9)
Gutless Democrats, I hate them more than Republicans. Tim Ryan is a coward. Say something fool! You look like your going pee yourself.

@psgent92264 @kevinrns @JoeNBC I think you're giving him too much credit I think he wrote the majorty opinion in Heller vs DC. He is still killing people from beyond the grave. That ruling was in contradiction to a significant number of other rulings by conservative judges on the same matter.
The more they ignore what the people want, the more the people should require! Don't want to make assault weapons illegal, the how about assault weapons and any gun that can accept a magazine over 5 rounds. #NeverAgain
Gun, all guns don't add anything to our lives. No, in the hands of civilians, they don't make anyone safer. Kids, are the reason we all live. By ignoring Kids, the FL GOP just proved they are not human, they are not Pro-Life they are Pro-Gun and Pro-Wealthy. That's about it.
@MichaelDenesyk @MediocreJedi I think you have hit an important point. If the Ruger 14 can accept a magazine of more than 5 rounds IT IS capable of mass killing. If it has an enclosed (door under the mag like many hunting arms), and the bolt closes after the last round it is a  safer weapon.

@SerialGramma Nobody (except the police) should have any gun that shoots more than 6 bullets. Nobody should have more the the 6 bullets in the gun on their person. No civilian should own or possess a magazine larger than 5 rounds. Period.
When I was a kid, almost nobody had any guns. Very few had hand guns. There were no assault weapon and no school shootings.		Somehow the NRA has convinced some morons that the more guns people have and the more bullets they hold, the safer we are. Nobody needs these kind of guns.

@leftjew I didn't lecture them. Some seem to see value in turning people against people that are doing the best they can. I am not sure the GOP cares enough to want to avoid a shut down. It wasn't worth a try if it only turns majority again Dems &amp; Dreamers.
@leftjew The way it is: if they go to the wall for the Dreamers , they won't have a chance at mid-term. If the Republicans take the midterms they will control the next round of census &amp; redistricting. Then they will be in charge for the next 12 years. You decide who is your best bet.

@commondefense @Ez4u2say_Janis @realDonaldTrump Seems like Twitter is taking sides, the wrong side.
If it's within the powers of the VA governor, he should order the statue destroyed, just to make a statement.
Trump has the power, under the law to prevent the carrying of weapons during protests to protect the public &amp; police.

Trump's fixation with Obama stems from how bad Obama owned him WH Correspondents Dinner.

China hopes we go nuclear with NK. That will make Angela Merkel the leader of the "Free World" and America the peria of the whole world.
@Salon Murdock has virtually ruined America by pushing his radical vision based on lies and turning people against each other. He should hang.
@realDonaldTrump They did all of that already? I don't think so. I doubt writing the contracts is even complete. Sir you are ill &amp; should Resign.
Is this GOP Congress going to remove this mentally ill, mental midget President, before or after we have a totally avoidable  nuclear war?
@NETRetired @Lawrence That is settled law, mostly no. Now that we have an "conservative" SCOTUS there is more concern about how "settled" is settled.
@Brasilmagic Our President is actually more demented than Kim Jong Un! Yikes!
