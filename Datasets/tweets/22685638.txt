Tonight's conversation was less heated than in August, but thoughtful, strong and important. Thank you for having us St. Louis.
@FWillisJohnson says we're reminded that we still have promises to keep, and miles to go before we sleep. #BeyondFerguson
@BeyondHousingMO talking trust &amp; justice "if we're going to address a multitude of challenges, &amp; tackle underlying issues." #BeyondFerguson
"I don't care what your background is," says @MariaChappelleN "What ties us is  education and our pursuit to be better." #BeyondFerguson
@MariaChappelleN: "As a person who appreciates democracy &amp; law, disheartening people don't know how hard we're fighting." #BeyondFerguson
"I want people to look at my face and see a life as valuable as their own," says @MsPackyetti #BeyondFerguson
@MsPackyetti says people can no longer run away from black pain, &amp; that makes her hopeful that people will see their value. #BeyondFerguson
Five years from now, where would you hope to be @deray? "Home, not worrying about the police killing me." #BeyondFerguson
@deray is asked if there's anything he regrets or would apologize for. He says "there's pain in blackness." #BeyondFerguson
@deray's final thoughts: People are angry. People love. People came out because enough was enough. People are powerful. #BeyondFerguson
Final thoughts? Rich McClure says he's been changed and "we must hold systems accountable, and hold ourselves accountable." #BeyondFerguson
We keep hearing about #Ferguson fatigue, but no one in this church is fatigued. #BeyondFerguson
What milestones? @deray says a disbanded police dept, and an update on investigations of other deaths. #BeyondFerguson
Words that are being repeated tonight: accountability, milestones, encouraged and discouraged. #BeyondFerguson
If you ask how do you teach children to be respectful? ask how do you teach police officers to be respectful? -@MariaChappelleN #Ferguson
"I'm part of the system," says @MariaChappelleN "Success for me is to tear down this wall of racism." #BeyondFerguson
Ferguson resident Tiffani Taylor asks if police should live in communities they serve. @MariaChappelleN says "I do. And research proves it."
Rich McClure says people are looking for one gamechanger, &amp; that doesn't exist. A series of milestones must be tackled. #BeyondFerguson
"Voting is a part of the solution," says @deray. But "the system shouldn't kill you whether you vote or not." #BeyondFerguson
@FWillisJohnson says "People need to get up off their seat and go vote in this community." #BeyondFerguson
"They fought for voting in the civil rights movement, &amp; we're still here," says @deray about whether voting is the solution. #BeyondFerguson
"Everyone around us is willing to say 'something ain't right here.' Except the community leadership," says @FWillisJohnson #BeyondFerguson
Ferguson resident Laura McLaughlin came b/c she was feeling fatigued, she asks what milestone she can look forward to. #BeyondFerguson
On disbanding police dep't, @MariaChappelleN says 'what is going on right now is a genocide' against black men in America. #BeyondFerguson
'Systems and structures shape the way people act,' @deray says. Police dept 'not about bad apples but a bad crop.' #BeyondFerguson
RT @stlpublicradio: .@NPRMichel asks: What's the major issue confronting us: Personal relationships or system flaws? #BeyondFerguson
Ferguson resident Gerry Jasper says she's been protesting since the beginning, "Things can change. People can change." #BeyondFerguson
RT @StlChange: "If you start the 'did you know' questions, pretty soon people say "I'm starting to understand'" - Rich McClure @NPRMichel @‚Ä¶
Rich McClure says he's encouraged because people are coming to the table and saying we need to deal with systemic issues. #BeyondFerguson
.@MsPackyetti says she remains encouraged "not because of processes but because of people." #BeyondFerguson
@MsPackyetti joining us says that she's pleased to see all sorts of people engaging to move forward. #BeyondFerguson

@BeyondHousingMO tells HS student asking what she can do, there's a collective humanity to understand. Recognize that and don't be silent.
Shoshana says she's a highschool student from an affluent, white school, and she thinks her peers should have done more. #BeyondFerguson
@deray says he's OK with the DOJ report, but he's ready for a trial. Darren Wilson should still be tried. #BeyondFerguson
@deray clarifies about protesters "We are not anti-police. We're anti-police brutality." #BeyondFerguson
Do you accept the DOJ's analysis of what happened? Michel asks the panel. @MariaChappelleN says she thinks a lot is missing. #BeyondFerguson
RT @shuneu: Law enforcement perspective completely gone from this conversation @NPRMichel #BeyondFerguson
RT @stlpublicradio: Rarely were protesters included in news stories then, @NPRMichel says. Now, it's different. #BeyondFerguson
RT @stlpublicradio: Before returning to #Ferguson, @NPRMichel said she looked at news coverage from the civil rights movement. #BeyondFergu‚Ä¶
@FWillisJohnson "I want people to stop shooting each other." Not just about black, Latino, cops, but everyone. #BeyondFerguson
What would feel like justice or progress to @FWillisJohnson? Michel asks. He says "honestly, I don't know." #BeyondFerguson
Michel asks: 'Why are you still protesting?' @deray's answer 'Why are the police still killing us?' #beyondferguson
"We know the protests aren't popular to some people," says @deray. "But to those sick of it, we're sick of living it." #BeyondFerguson
@MariaChappelleN says "thank you Mike Brown for giving us a voice." #BeyondFerguson
"Stop it, stop it, stop it!" Michel mentions a letter written by "2 white people who just want to live their lives." #BeyondFerguson
Since Aug 9th, @FWillisJohnson says we've found even more ways to keep people's voices out. The audience agrees vocally. #BeyondFerguson
But @FWillisJohnson says he's also discouraged because he sometimes wonders if St. Louis wants to change. #BeyondFerguson
'I'm obviously optimistic &amp; encouraged. There's a generation that has come forward," says @FWillisJohnson #BeyondFerguson
@BeyondHousingMO says you have to be encouraged. "We're in the process of change." His org is building a movie theatre. #BeyondFerguson
@deray says we can't change 200 years of racism in 200 days. #BeyondFerguson
RT @KelseyProud: #Ferguson resident Carlotta Holt speaking at #BeyondFerguson http://t.co/fZTxPTL5zn

@deray says "a community has been born in protest since August." #BeyondFerguson
@deray says "we've not yet seen justice." And says everyone is now confronted with talking about race. #BeyondFerguson
RT @stlpublicradio: Where are we now? @FWillisJohnson: "We still have promises to keep. We still have a million miles to go." #BeyondFergus‚Ä¶
