9) Democrats are effectively calling those who put their lives on the line at the border, liars. Border agents are telling them how bad it is, there is video, there is proof and democrats know it's true.....	But they hate Donald Trump. That makes the shut down THEIR FAULT.
8) .@NBCNews .@ABC .@MSNBC .@CBSEveningNews 	.@nprpolitics .@CNN are in partnership with democrats to destroy the United States.	"Manufactured crisis"	"Vanity Project" 	"Immoral"	"Temper Tantrum"	Recognize those talking points?

6) There is an ugly violation of the Constitution being seen in the senate......Religious Discrimination. .@SenFeinstein .@KamalaHarris  have most notably brought this to light with their anti-religious behavior. Kammie wants to be president? Not if you violate the Constitution.
5) .@StenyHoyer .@SpeakerPelosi .@chuckschumer	 .@KamalaHarris .@CoryBooker .@SenFeinstein are afraid to reprimand a 1 day on the job anti-Semitic house member, that's it's not allowed to call the President of the United States a "Mother Fucker" just because she hates him.
4) .@SpeakerPelosi  &amp; .@chuckschumer don't actually believe a word they're saying about the border. They're really not stupid people, they know this will strain taxpayers to the max &amp; ultimately end in the deaths of many more American citizens.
3) .@GavinNewsom is going to let illegals run wild, &amp; allow Commiefornia to become an even bigger sewer than it is now. He smiles &amp; laughs because he knows his brat will go to private school &amp; no illegal creep will ever say something filthy to his wife in Spanish.
