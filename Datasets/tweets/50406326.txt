Deploying troops to the border was viewed in the Pentagon as expensive, wasteful, but ultimately not an illegal order or corrosive to security. The Syrian pullout, and the abandonment of Kurdish fighters, was a far different matter: a policy decision Mattis resigned over.
Mattis constantly mentioned the importance of backing allies throughout his tenure. Trump had little interest, indeed often relishes poking allies in Europe, elsewhere. In his exit letter, Mattis made clear this was a fundamental disagreeemtn.
Mattis letter cites importance of allies, danger of Russia and China. Mattis says Trump should have a SecDef whose views are better aligned with the President's. Immediately raises questions about Trump's plans not just for Syria, Afghanistan but also NATO.

Obama framing troop extension as "modest but meaningful extension."
Decision wouldn't have been made if not for new Afghan gov. Obama: "In the Afghan government we have a serious partner that wants our help."
Obama: "This mission is vital to our national security interests."
"I do not send you into harm's way lightly": Obama speaking to US troops.
Obama: "Today is a reminder that the United States keeps our commitments."
German official: The Obama announcement "is in line with what we have been asking for." Obama announcement means Germany will stay in North.
Obama: We will work with allies and partners .... to align their presence in Afghanistan
Obama will cut troop presence to 5500 at the end of next year. But what if newly elected President asks him to delay those cuts?
Obama says tasks for US force will remain narrowly focused on training, CT.
Obama says continued troop presence is needed to maintain security in Afghanistan.
Afghan President Ghani has asked for continuing support, Obama says.
Obama: In key areas of the country the security situation is very fragile.
Obama: Afghan forces are not as strong as they need to be ... and the Taliban has made gains. ... Much of this is predictable.
Obama: "When the Taliban has made gains, as in Kunduz, Afghan forces backed by coalition forces have been able to push them back."
Obama says where adjustments have been needed "we have made those adjustments."
Obama: I meet regularly with national security team ... to honestly assess the situation on the ground.
Obama: Our troops remain engaged in Training afghan forces and CT operations
