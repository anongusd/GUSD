A3: "Get involved. Reach out to your sponsor partners." #IPAWebinar
A2: "There are solutions in the market today. Development cycles are tight and scarce. I'd encourage people to look at the technology - is it committed to STP? Is it creating transparency?" #IPAWebinar
...You have to think about: how much cost you can occur, what benefit is important to you, etc. Think about instituting an electronic document vs. having people fill them out by hand." #IPAWebinar
Q: What's the next best step that a broker-dealer can take towards creating some of these efficiencies?	A1: "Sitting down internally &amp; identifying what benefits they can bring to their shop will help figure out the best course of action. Everyone is different...
Q: What are you seeing on the electronic processing side?	A: "There are some growing pains, but we've made great headwinds on what we need to do to automate the process, but we're still putting that in place." #IPAWebinar
"Everyone knows they want STP and understands the need to get there, but it's very difficult to see how we will get there, the costs associated with getting there and what the benefits will be." #IPAWebinar
Q: What are the headwinds for STP?	A: "1) Cost; 2) Identifying the cost to benefit ratio for firms; and 3) There is not a lot of measurement right now." #IPAWebinar
Q: What's the opportunity for STP against where we are today?	A: "The opportunity is large. In our market, we haven't quite gotten to the first inning. You can see teams are warming up, but these are the early days. The opportunity here is to create standardization." #IPAWebinar
Q: What constitutes straight through processing (STP)? 	A: "A process creating a paperless process for #alternatives -- the complete and total elimination of paper; This is essentially perpetuating a lot of challenges we see today." #IPAWebinar
Kicking off today's #IPAWebinar now - tune in for an #AltsEdge Broker-Dealer webinar series featuring a discussion on Straight Through Processing.

"At the end of 10 years, you don't have an opportunity zone. You've burned off all of the benefits of #OpportunityZones. But at the end of the day, it all comes back to the property, and the deal. You do these deals because they're great development deals ...

"The individual investor is competing with the pension fund world. Expedience and timing will be crucial to succeeding in this world." #IPAForum2019
"Our tax-advantaged capital is competing with our tax-exempt capital. You have to think about how you're competing to raise the capital, but also think about what your niche/advantage will be to raise that capital." #IPAForum2019
"Not all #OpportunityZones are created equally. There are 6.8M parcels of #CRE that fit into #QOZ." #IPAForum2019

Thank you @ChrisDonahoe for an insightful discussion on Millennials with Money. #IPAWebinar
Insight 4: "Millennials are much more skeptical - in fact, 80% of millennials are suspicious of recs made by commission-based salespeople." Key takeaway: Find ways to connect shared interests &amp; values with stakeholders through company action. #IPAWebinar
"The real takeaway here is: There is a huge opportunity from a market standpoint. Clearly, there's blatant demand for advice and financial planning purposes to help millennials reach their financial goals." #IPAWebinar
"While affluent millennials are increasingly financially savvy &amp; exploring a wider array of financial investment products to meet their need for diverse financial products, that sophistication hasn't brought less stress. They are still stressed out by their finances." #IPAWebinar
Insight 2: "Affluent millennials are very digitally fluent, and they are embracing disruption." #IPAWebinar
"80 percent of millennials consider themselves financially successful. There is a real demand for financial advisers to help millennials reach their goals." #IPAWebinar

Fees, dividend coverage and asset class are the top three things that contribute to strengthening being able to pay your stockholders. -#IPAWebinar panelist
Q: What do you see as best practices broker-dealers and RIA's should be taking as they evaluate these investments?	A: First and foremost from a due diligence perspective: it's the fundamental strength of the management group and underlying portfolio. #IPAWebinar
Most people associate preferred stock as a lower risk income. #IPAWebinar

Thank you to our panelists Randy Anderson, President, @GCAssets; Derek O'Leary, Managing Director, @OwlRockCapital; and Rohit Vohra, COO, @ofiglobal for such a great discussion on BDCs and Interval Funds on the last #IPAWebinar of the year.
"BDCs have a fairly big bucket of things they can do, but there is a misconception – 'BDCs have a higher fee proposition than interval funds.' You can have high or low fees on both." #IPAWebinar
"Risk is not the same for BDCs and interval funds. Make sure to look at the quality of sponsorship, quality of asset, and efficacy of those deals. And then ask yourself if you have true risk or volatility." #IPAWebinar
"What private credit does for you: It helps you step away from emotion-driven volatility in the marketplace and can help you make rational decisions purely on credit. These decisions need to be rationally driven, rather than emotionally driven." #IPAWebinar
"There is a tremendous amount of growth in the private capital market. Today, we are touching $5 trillion. If you invest only in public markets, you're losing a big opportunity." -#IPAWebinar panelist Rohit Vohra, COO, @ofiglobal - Carlyle JV
"Structure and appreciating a liquidity profile is so important." #IPAWebinar
.@GCAssets' Randy Anderson shares his 5 buckets to focus on:	1. The bank space; 2. The high yield bond market; 3. Structured credit market; 4. Middle market lending; and 5. Special situation loans

"The more we can communicate our initiatives to protect our investors and display transparency, the better our priorities will resonate with Congress, particularly with the Democratic majority in the House." #IPAWebinar
"In terms of Reg BI... we'll likely see some action from the Financial Services Committee and some sort of legislation around fiduciary standards to push the SEC to take better enforcement action." #IPAWebinar
"With Maxine Waters coming in as chair... we'll see a lot of noise and fury toward the current administration, but also a good amount of behind the scenes, bipartisan work, especially with Patrick McHenry, when it comes to certain issues." #IPAWebinar
"What you saw in this election is that the American people do not like when one party has complete control of the government... and neither does the economy, which is why I think the financial services sector has so far reacted well to the election outcome." #IPAWebinar

"The biggest buyers of these assets are public funds. They typically merge and issue shares. Alternatively, the fund would list itself, and become its own traded entity." #IPAWebinar
"Finally, there's an interval fund structure. This is mandatory liquidity. You'll see a very heavy liquidity fee - which could be traded REITs, cash, etc." #IPAWebinar
"A popular one over the last several years, is a perpetual REIT offering. These offer price transparency on a daily basis, and the ability to liquidate on a monthly or quarterly process." #IPAWebinar
"These are the three main ones: First, traditional life cycle REITs - recommending an investment that lasts 5-7 years. The focus is an accumulation of a portfolio." #IPAWebinar
"Asset bases are real assets. Think stocks, bonds, intellectual property, real estate real stuff!" #IPAWebinar
"There has been a real movement with wealth managers moving towards real assets," says #IPAWebinar speaker Mark Goldberg, CEO, @GriffinCapital.

Why make your voice heard about the Regulation Best Interest? "There's a benefit to participation, whether to address frustration or to be on the record for supporting this regulation. It's important to know what needs to be done." John Grady, @DLA_Piper #IPAWebinar
“You have to have certain reasons to recommend certain products, and document why it’s in the best interest of the client." Anya Coverman #IPAWebinar
“We’re likely to get a lot more feedback than ever before. I can’t say if it will be positive or negative, but it gives you a flavor of what the SEC is going after." Mark Quinn, @CeteraFinancial #IPAWebinar
What state action may we see this year?		"This proved popular when the federal government stepped back from regulatory issues. If the fed isn’t going to protect consumers, perhaps the states can. Whether the momentum is still there, we’ll see." John Grady, @DLA_Piper #IPAWebinar
If you were ready for DOL, are you ready for Regulation Best Interest? “The short answer is considerably so. But one big difference is the SEC is much more cognizant of the differences between investment advisors and broker/dealers.” – Mark Quinn, @CeteraFinancial #IPAWebinar

The IPA thanks @RealAssetsAdv for their partnership in today's thoughtful discussion on private credit investments on our #IPAWebinar!
"I think alternative credit really can provide a solution to provide some income and do it in a way to protect it if rates continue to go up." #IPAWebinar
"If we all assume fixed income is a core component of an investor's portfolio, there are a lot of different ways to get fixed income exposure." #IPAWebinar
"I think it's a good time to be a credit investor especially with the focus for #alternative credit, whether you think of it as traditional vs. alternative investments or core vs. core plus." #IPAWebinar
"It's easy to say this credit cycle has lasted a long time, so it must be near its end. But we don't really see a lot of that right now. It's hard to say where we are and what will happen, but companies seem pretty stable." #IPAWebinar

Importance of 1031 Exchanges for real estate: "Keeping the messaging alive is really important because this was a huge win, and something we really fought hard to preserve! I hope it is difficult to change, as this has been a threat for a few years." #IPAwebinar
"After the 1986 Tax Reform Act, there were hardly any technical corrections made for 10 years. It takes time for these things to be done." -#IPAwebinar panelist
What will happen next in terms of legislative changes to the tax bill? "You need support from both sides of Congress for that, and right now, Democrats have little to no interest in changing the tax bill at this point." #IPAwebinar
"If you have a 20% tax rate, you have less incentive to go look for low income tax credits." #IPAwebinar panelist

Big thanks to our #IPAwebinar panelists - Doyle Barlett, co-founder, Eris Group and John Burges, Managing Director, Prospect Capital Management, for an insightful discussion on infrastructure investments.
"We know that, we are, in most cases, going to get our money back in infrastructure involvements in the U.S. There is great opportunity here," says #IPAwebinar panelist.
Key benefit to infrastructure investing: Infrastructure debt has a much lower default rate (~3.5%) compared to general corporate debt default rate (~15%). #IPAwebinar
A key benefit of infrastructure investing: It is very uncorrelated to general market return -- these are lifelong assets and are very recession-resistant. #IPAwebinar
What types of infrastructure do you consider to be most attractive to private investors? "Could be toll roads or vendors providing to those types of projects -- or rather private loans to companies" says #IPAwebinar panelist.

A key takeaway #IPAwebinar on leveraging 1031 exchanges for tax advantaged returns: Investors must make sure to consult their CPA and tax attorney on cash out refinancing to ensure compliance
A key structural takeaway: Most asset classes fit well into the DST and Master Lease structure but can become cumbersome in certain situations #IPAwebinar
We're talking 1031 exchanges on today's #IPAwebinar: One advantage of a DST structure is that it allows investors to create a "mini-REIT structure"

"I think 2017 was a really good indicator of where [the industry is] going -- $2.6 trillion assets moved into the private equity sector; there was close to $500 billion in aggregated capital gains and close to $870 billion in cash reserves" -Brian Buehler #IPAwebinar

"In private equity, if we as a firm don't get the terms that we want in a deal or company we are going to acquire, we don't do the deal, so the biggest takeaway is -- are you in more or less control of your client's dollar?" says Brian Buehler. #IPAwebinar

We’re gratified that IPA’s Valuation Guideline is consistent with that which FINRA says are mandatory after 2 yrs &amp; optional before 2 yrs
IPA’s work on FINRA’s proposal is the latest initiative taken with federal and state regulators to standardize industry best practices
The IPA will respond to FINRA’s proposal during the comment period designated by the SEC. #12-14 #SEC #FINRA
IPA has worked tirelessly with FINRA to revise the existing customer account statement rules to enhance transparency
