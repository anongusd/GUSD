@Jennifrrrrr @FairParkRising Glad to see some clear thinking, rather than a witty comeback. I represented officers for a long time. Some of my clients had their lives torn apart by false allegations. A small amount pled guilty or were found guilty of felony offenses. We need oversight, but we need to be fair
@Jennifrrrrr @FairParkRising Oh, so the formula we should be following is: One member (of a group, race, religion) has done (morally bad thing) therefore, all (group, race, religion) does (morally bad thing). How has that type of thinking brought about positive solutions in the world?

Recognizing religion as part of our culture and the philosophical bed rock of our nation is essential to the continuation of both.
@GodlessAtheist 1. theism is not PX. 2. I did, read Rehnquist's arguments.
@GodlessAtheist  one of the philosophical premises of the Declaration & Constitution is  theism. I side with former Justice Rehnquist. #tcot

With Obey stepping down, if the GOP picks up PA-12, the DNCC will be unable to raise money after what can turn out to be a brutal May. #tcot
Mayor Bloomberg, care to explain your insinuation that a tea partier was behind the attempted bombing? #teaparty #tcot

Happy anniversary and congratulations Tea Party. You've forced the nation to engage in meaningful dialog about big government.#taxday
I am proud to have received the endorsement of the Dallas Fraternal Order of Police.
Just started using Piryx.com for campaign contributions after seeing Gov. Perry use it. Perry's campaign staff is really sharp.
Happy Easter. He has risen!

I hoping Kay doesn't leave the Senate. There are great replacements in the wings, but it will be an unnecessary distraction.

Happy Texas Independence Day! Texans, if you have not voted, please make time to do so.

My prediction that the GOP would be 68% of total turnout could come true- GOP accounts for 63% of early voters in Dallas County.
A mentally ill individual flew a plane into an IRS building because he was mentally ill. Let's not read any politics into this one.

"Government Solutions" for job creation? Government is the problem! GOP will win on "Limited Government" solutions. #tcot
TX Early voting - 2/16. A good predictor of a party's success is their turnout numbers in the primary. Prediction: GOP 68% of total turnout.

NBC - "48 percent blame Republicans in Congress " for not being able to find solutions to the country’s problems. How? We have no power!
Arguing over whether the Dems or the GOP should be worried? No one should be worried. We have a healthy democracy - by the people.
Air America Media will be filing for bankruptcy and is off air. This, my friends, is efficiency in the "marketplace of ideas." #gop #tcot
Dallas County doesn't have to stay Democrat. I'm going to be working hard for the next 9 months to prove the GOP judges can deliver justice!
If Brown wins this, the Dems will be in free fall. We need our strongest GOP voices making the case for limited government until Nov. 2.
I will miss, if elected judge, getting the real story from the accused. Defense attorneys know, the truth is always stranger than fiction.
This Mass. race has become really interesting. If the GOP pulls off another big one, do you think the Dems will be able to raise any money?
Just filed for Dallas County Criminal Court #7 this morning. It feels good to be a part of the 2010 Republican Revolution! #tcot #gop
It sickens me to see the will of the people undone by the Senate, but the make no mistake, their careers will be undone in 2010.
Unless there is a Christmas Miracle, the Senate bill passes. Unless there is a demographic miracle, the dems get crushed in 2010.
Sorry to see that Harry Reid will have to work this weekend. He won't have to worry about that in 2011, since he'll be out of work.
With consumer spending down, hopefully compassion and love will be up. Can't wrap it, but loved ones remember kindness more than things.

About my campaign - signatures to get on the ballot are going well. Have been getting lots of encouragement from lawyers that know me.
I know its foolish to hope for another Reagan, but can we at least have someone emerge that we'll look to for inspiration for 30 years?
the Senate needs to stop this bill. We need to let Washington know there is going to be hell to pay in 2010.
Dems health care plan will die soon. It is very important that the GOP plan gets in front of every American. The people will get behind it.
Listening to Commissioner Ken Mayfield. He's got great energy.
today's elections, the GOP delivers a jab. Nov. 2010 the Dems eat a cross. Nov. 2012 we hit them with the hook and KO the liberal agenda.
Hoffman- 1 vote in the house, but symbolically huge. The media will balk and say we're to far right, the people will say we are just right.
Prediction: VA is a GOP 12 pt. blow out, 23rd goes to Hoffman and NJ is at least in a recount. Magically, Obamacare dies in the Senate.
KKK protesting by my Dad's school tomorrow - they're forced to let kids out to avoid trouble. Vile. No one should to hurt, especially kids.
Last political advice I got from my grandfather (Tom Kindness) was to use your time well. He saw the GOP fall and rise. Ready for this rise?
The Republican party should be home to people seeking to solve problems locally, with regard to the sensibilities of that locality.
Great night getting signatures - Dallas Republican Lawyers and Greater Mesquite Republicans. Heard Michael Williams, our next Senator.
Great to see Sen. Cornyn today at Dallas Federalist Society. If you are a Originalist you need to be a member of the Federalist Society.

Look into medicaid "never events"- MRSA is one of them. The gov. is cutting off those in need already, they will do the same with everyone.

Garland labor day parade was great, lots of support. The GOP will be strong in Dallas in 2010.
States rights have a bad rap because of its historical tie to racism - time for Republicans explain that it is about efficient government.
Solid early start. Plan on doing the same if elected judge.
"Never let a serious crisis go to waste" - excactly Rahm-bo. We will use this crisis to expose your party's lack of leadership and logic.

Made a bet with my boss the Obama would have under 50% approval rating before September - still in the running for a free steak.
