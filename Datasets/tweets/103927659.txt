Two congressmen, a Republican and a Democrat, working together to demand details about all separated children, including who and where they, and their parents, are https://t.co/VXfaRSdqRP
Is a DNA match a requirement for reuniting kids or just one of your possible vetting tools? If it is required, what about parents who aren't related biologically?
How many cases have you had of detained adults posing as parents to take children who aren't theirs? Is this a serious threat?
You say HHS knows who and where all the minors are, but do you know who and where their detained parents are? Were such records kept when separations occurred?
Here are a few questions I didn't get to ask @SecAzar today: Your goal is to put separated children and their parents in weekly contact, but how do you do this with the babies?
Azar says it is difficult to confirm parentage, and because of "artificial" court deadlines is prevented from its "standard or even truncated vetting process."
“We want this to be as compassionate a process as humanly can be. As broken as our immigration system is, we still want to treat people as well as humanly possible going through this difficult process," Azar said.
No children have been reunited with their parents held in ICE detention centers, but Azar said they are working to do so by the court's deadlines. For children under 4, detained parents are being moved to facilities "extremely close" to where their kids are.
News from the @SecAzar call: HHS knows knows "identity and location of every minor" in its care and is working "expeditiously" as possible to meet court order to reunite the under 3,000 separated children, about 100 under 5 years old, with their parents.

.@SenBobCasey asks @SecAzar if HHS consulted with @AmerAcadPeds in the lead up to the separation of children from parents. Azar said he's not aware of any engagement.
.@SecAzar says no separate process for kids separated at the border. Same process HHS uses for all unaccompanied minors.
Interesting. @SecAzar asked if HHS was involved in designing "zero tolerance policy" and secretary says "it wouldn't be appropriate" for him to discuss.
.@SecAzar says he'd "gladly put them back with their parents" but that it's Congress' job to change the law to allow kids to stay together in detention centers.
Then @RonWyden asked how many parents know where their kids are, and @SecAzar could not provide an exact number, but said all of that info is available on the ORR portal. Wyden: "American people getting lots of deception, lots of rosy answers and not a lot of facts."
.@RonWyden asks how many kids have been reunified. @SecAzar says 100s have been released into custody of parent or other relative. There were 2,300+ in HHS care and now there is 2,047.
.@RonWyden to @SecAzar: Administration that dehumanized these kids and their parents and normalizes this behavior has a lot to answer for.
