@surgfish I respect your view. But I‚Äôm of the mindset of not giving up on the youth, no matter what behavior they may exhibit as of now. Speaking both as a father and a public official .
Both the offender and victim are minors. They both have futures ahead of them. In the frenzy following the incident involving the two children, we adults might be forgetting that both children need to be nurtured out of this unfortunate situation.
Parents of the victim of the Ateneo bullying incident appeal for their son not to be memorialized as the "bullied boy"..Child psychologist on TV keeps referring to the perpetrator as "the bully", reinforcing the label. Shouldn't they just be referred to as offender and victim?
@tokensoutherner @SkywaySOMCO They should present their plan to those affected.

@Simply_Clinton The idea is not to simply let him stay. As I had mentioned, impose sanctions, rehabilitate and supervise closely. Let his victims see him undergo the penalties and rehab, let him experience facing his victims without him being able to inflict any physical or psychological harm.
There‚Äôs a golden opportunity for Ateneo here to embark on a pioneering move in education..to come up with a program to rehabilitate bullies with this student as the first subject. Expelling him is the easy way out for the school which was negligent to prevent it or even notice it
Schools should go beyond simply having an anti-bullying campaign with slogans as primary tools. They should create proactive monitoring systems and feedback mechanisms. Counterintelligence, as it is known in the armed services.
@anakin0413 Punishment can take different forms. Yes expulsion is one of them. Im looking at the bigger picture of bullying and how to address it not just by punishment but also by prevention and rehabilitation.
@DoubleDamage40 Removal from the team, should be automatic. In-campus community service, that‚Äôs a good option.
@MaamSyj Yes, I agree.
Let the school bear the responsibility of reforming the bully which, in the first place, went on because of a certain degree of negligence by the school.
Yes, the first instinct is for us to say expel the bully. But as for me, it‚Äôs just sweeping the problem under the rug, and allows the bully to simply reign in another campus. I would go for having the school impose certain sanctions and rehabilitate the child.
I don‚Äôt think the bully should be kicked out. That would only harden him &amp; still be a bully in his new school. Let him stay under a closely supervised rehab program. Ban him from competing TKD for the school. Let him face daily those he tormented.
@julietancio Really? Was that in the school parking lot?
I‚Äôm a father of 4 sons. Just like my father raised me, I raised them not to bully anyone. I monitor them in school to make sure they don‚Äôt bully and don‚Äôt get bullied. As a father, I pray my sons don‚Äôt encounter a bully like the one in the video.

@dexcabalzaINQ Very good! Finally!
@dexcabalzaINQ They should verify the basis of the salary adjustment they received.
@dexcabalzaINQ I‚Äôm referring to the increase under Joint Resolution No.1 approved on January 1, 2018 where only the AFP, BJMP, BFP, PCG, PNP, PPSC and NAMRIA were specifically included. BUCOR was excluded.
@dexcabalzaINQ I think that‚Äôs the salary adjustment due to the passage of the BUCOR law which was belatedly implemented. Cong. Pong Biazon was the author of that law that was passed in 2013.
@dexcabalzaINQ It‚Äôs now part of the EO that was recently passed?
In the meantime, they were not beneficiaries in the recent salary adjustment for uniformed personnel in spite of our efforts to  include them because they were not included in the category of government‚Äôs uniformed personnel. https://t.co/TNk9N01pQk

@basta_Dr1ver @piaranada Yes the law prescribes how uniformed personnel performing their duties may seek justice for disrespect by any person. And it doesn‚Äôt include physically hurting the offender.
@romerojo7 I saw the video. Different people have different views whether the reporters violated personal space or were rude. My only point is that restraint from hurting civilians is a duty of soldiers, not a debt of gratitude that civilians owe them.
@boitennisaddict Being a son of a military officer and an advocate for the military in congress, I completely agree that men in uniform doing their duty deserve to be respected. But they should also bear in mind that ‚Äúhurting‚Äù civilians, even if rude to them, is not an option.

@gbbaldo Good morning!
@markcojuangco @philippinebeat Seems like a free-for-all...different agendas converging on the issue. The good mixed with the bad.
@markcojuangco @EngrRezCab @philippinebeat ....rapid decrease in platelet count. Criteria for severe dengue include any sign of severe plasma leakage leading to shock or fluid accumulation with respiratory distress, severe bleeding, or severe organ impairment. 2/2
@markcojuangco @EngrRezCab @philippinebeat According to WHO: Warning signs of severe dengue include abdominal pain or tenderness, persistent vomit- ing, clinical  uid accumulation, mucosal bleeding, lethargy or restlessness, liver enlargement of &gt;2 cm, or an increase in haematocrit concurrent with a rapid decrease....1/2
@markcojuangco @philippinebeat The relevance of the risks to seronegative individuals is highlighted by the information that the mass immunization was implemented indiscrimately. That there was no test given to determine whether the recipient was seropositive or seronegative.
@markcojuangco @philippinebeat Just for clarity, I don't share the  position of those who raise the alarm in the form of doomsday scenarios due to the Dengvaxia scare. My focus is on disclosure of the risks and what I believe is a judgment call that should have been made to err on the side of safety.
@markcojuangco @EngrRezCab @philippinebeat Yes I agree. Dengvaxia does not kill. Dengue does. What it does is increase the risk of severe dengue in seroprevalent  recipients. Severe dengue that could eventually kill the infected.
@markcojuangco @philippinebeat It would have been best to suspend the implementation after the statement in the July 2016 until confirmation, which later on was announced Nov 2017. As I said, err on the side of safety.
@markcojuangco @philippinebeat It wasn't semantics . Their Nov 2017 findings were an affirmation of what was in the 2016 report.
@markcojuangco @philippinebeat Eventually, their Nov 2017 request for a label change confirmed the risk pointed out in the 2016 WHO report. But by that time, the massive vaccination had already taken place.
@markcojuangco @philippinebeat Instead of advising PH-DOH to be cautious in implementation pending the confirmatory tests, they allowed the immunization to continue. They chose to err on the side of profit instead of erring on the side of caution.
@markcojuangco @philippinebeat It wasn't speculation. It was based on initial findings of clinical trials. When confronted w/ it, Mr Triomphe changed tact, saying they knew about it and that's why they did further tests..
@markcojuangco @philippinebeat When I questioned Mr. Triomphe, he initially said Sanofi only found out recently and made the disclosure Nov 2017.
@markcojuangco @philippinebeat There's indication that the info about the risks was revealed by WHO in a July 2016 report.
@rambotalabong @rapplerdotcom Before they purchase, they should put into place legal and administrative policies, operational rules and procedures, as well as include the support infrastructure such as data archiving..
@philippinebeat There are congs focusing on the procurement process. I'm looking at the liability of Sanofi for withholding from Govt relevant information that dealt with the risk associated w/ seronegative subjects. After all, that could be the cause of the deaths of the vaccine recipients.

@beacupin I filed the bill proposing for the use of bodycams back in August 2016. The PNP's position: " we'd rather buy bullets than bodycams"..they only got pressured to consider bodycams late 2017.
@beacupin Well, I'm an avid proponent of bodycams. But I say the PNP should first lay down the operational procedures, administrative &amp; legal policies and support infrastructure before they buy. It's not simply buying the cameras per se.
@beacupin If that's the case, I don't think its an either-or situation for the PNP, as long as procurement was done properly.
@beacupin My understanding is that there's a separate budget for the bodycams and the dogs. So that shouldn't be a problem. There's problem only if there's any anomaly in the purchase.

@mlltamayo I filed a bill proposing the use of bodycam by law enforcers last July 2016. It embodies policy and legal framework. Implementing rules should follow after its passage into law. The PNP initially rejected the idea.
What we need is an honest to goodness  bodycam program the footage of w/c can be validly used in court. Not simply putting them on cops just to placate those calling for accountability in police ops. Not a placebo.
Use of the bodycam by police isn't just about having the bodycams on them. The equally important aspect is the storage and archiving, legal basis, rules &amp; regulations and standard operating procedures.
Oh...so now they're going to use body cameras...they should make sure the use is covered with legal basis and proper implement rules &amp; regulations and standard operating procedures.

@michaeltabuyan Normally, the vote is only taken for the entire General Appropriations Bill, not on individual agencies.

@1alienfrommars @gapolicarpio @nwlgrcia @DiNaProfMSSyj The declaration by the president is different from the extension by Congress.
@1alienfrommars @gapolicarpio @nwlgrcia @DiNaProfMSSyj The Constitution is clear on who extends and determines the extension.
@1alienfrommars @gapolicarpio @nwlgrcia @DiNaProfMSSyj Constitution: "the Congress may, in the same manner, extend such proclamation or suspension for a period to be determined by the Congress"
@gapolicarpio @nwlgrcia @DiNaProfMSSyj You may review my twitter timeline..it's there, along with statements on other issues.
@gapolicarpio @nwlgrcia @DiNaProfMSSyj This is the portion of the letter of the President to the Congress requesting extension which pertains to rehabilitation. https://t.co/dL2H5fPp2z
@nwlgrcia @gapolicarpio @DiNaProfMSSyj Yes, AFP is in clearing phase, meaning the enemy has been reduced in strength in Marawi. But fighting is still ongoing, threat still there.

@sky_walker66 @gapolicarpio @DiNaProfMSSyj I've brought that matter up to concerned officials. Legislators' principal duty is lawmaking &amp; representing constituents in Congress.

@nwlgrcia @gapolicarpio @DiNaProfMSSyj Yes I considered the past, but most especially the present. The threat of terrorist rebels and the professionalism of present day AFP.
@michaeltabuyan @gapolicarpio @DiNaProfMSSyj Been using social media since 2008. I've always looked at it as means to connect with constituents.But I still prefer face to face dialogues
@gapolicarpio @DiNaProfMSSyj In my four terms in Congress, I've always given priority to what I believe is good for my district and the country.
@gapolicarpio @DiNaProfMSSyj Aside from getting the feel of the pulse, I also consider information that may not be available to the public but accessible to officials.

Assigning PNP or AFP personnel to serve as prison guards shud be temporary while creating a credible prison guard force is being undertaken.
What should've been done was to retrain or hire new BUCOR guards so that the service will be like that of disciplined forces such as PNP/AFP
Martial Law part of rebuilding? Isn't it only in case of invasion or rebellion, when the public safety requires it? https://t.co/6ph6tLW79P
As long as the conditions in the prisons remain hellish, the motivation to pay for comfort through illegal trade will likewise remain.
DOJ should pursue previous plans to transfer the Bilibid to new building in a new location. Make the prison more humane w/ proper facilities
Reports of drug trade back in Bilibid. Deployment of Marines mulled by DOJ. Please, spare the Marines from such assignment.

@jackiefoz1 Thanks for the tip! Will look into that..
@jackiefoz1 Interesting angle you have...that hasn't been brought up.
BFP said that since they were not able to inspect premises, they were unfamiliar with the layout which could have helped them plan their ops
This issue regarding the authority of PEZA to issue FSIC puts into doubt all fire safety inspection certificates they have issued.
PEZA law was passed '95, amended in '98. Fire Code was passed in 2008. Clearly,BFP has mandate issue FSIC. But they are barred at PEZA zones
Resortsworld may have been operating w/o a valid Fire Safety Inspection Certificate. PEZA insisting on a law already superseded by Fire Code

@limbertqc @KimIndar There'll be a briefing for senate &amp; house this week.After that,pwede mag file ng reso to revoke if ML seen unwarranted.
@limbertqc @KimIndar Well, that could help clarify the law. After all, this is only the 2nd time we're  using this consti provision.
@KimIndar @limbertqc Thats what happened before.
@limbertqc @KimIndar My interpretation is that it's not mandatory to convene the joint session in 48 hours.
@KimIndar @limbertqc In case of Proc1959, deliberate to determine whether to revoke or not.
@KimIndar @limbertqc In the case of PGMA ML, the reso was to deliberate on the proclamation.
@KimIndar @limbertqc But definitely it will go through the three readings.
@KimIndar @limbertqc Committee on Rules will most likely act on it.
@KimIndar @limbertqc So at this point any sen or rep may file a reso to convene in jt session.Reso will be considered &amp; if passed,jt session
@KimIndar @limbertqc In the case of Proc 216, the congress was in session during proclamation. So the 24 hr rule is unnecessary.
@KimIndar @limbertqc Yes. While in session, the resolutions to convene jointly will be filed in both chambers and go through legis mill.
@KimIndar @limbertqc A senator or rep (or a number of them), must file a resolution w/c will undergo legis process.
@KimIndar @limbertqc The legislative process must be played out first before a joint session to vote on revocation happens.
@KimIndar @limbertqc The revocation can only happen after the legislative process leading to the convening of a joint session is completed.
@KimIndar @limbertqc  24 hour rule is applicable when the Congress isn't in session.The rule makes sure that Cong is in session immediately.
@KimIndar @limbertqc My reading on that is for the congress to convene to be ready to take action.
@DeKampanilya @limbertqc That's my reading. The 24 hours only if not in session. Just to ensure availability for joint session.
@DeKampanilya @limbertqc Doesn't 48 hours apply to president's obligation to submit a report to the Congress, not for Congress to convene?

@limbertqc There's a video of the president being interviewed on the plane and he said he "declared martial law".
@legallytanned I'm not a lawyer but my reading of the law makes me believe so. For legal and practical reasons.
Images of "bakwit" in Marawi seen on social media. It shows the social cost of conflict.
Even with media pronouncements of ML declaration, AFP should await issuance of specific operational orders on rules of engagement under ML.
Let's hope that our security forces are able to convincingly get things under control before the issuance of a formal declaration.
@mariocornejo @nordomingoy position is that there has to be a written proclamation, a document which triggers the process.
@econcepcion Hindi pa yata
Until I see the signed and numbered proclamation, I don't think we're in a state of Martial Law as of the moment.
An actual proclamation document, with a proclamation number &amp; president's signature, hasn't been issued, right? I haven't seen it yet.
Managing this crisis isn't confined to quelling the violence.It includes communicating its isolation &amp; normalcy in other parts of d country.

Remember, there are other groups in Mindanao who might take advantage of the situation in Marawi. We need to be on alert in other areas.
Advice to AFP, w/ due respect: in a crisis like this,it's better to hear from a ranking commander w/ leadership post than a spokesperson.
At this time, let's keep our sights trained on our common enemy---extremist terrorists.
@mas10ph The extremists have presence in Mindanao. They may initiate diversionary attacks in other parts of the island.
I have no problem with that declaration of Martial Law in Mindanao.
Good call, to come home.
@michaeltabuyan Yes, he should.
Finally, the commander of the PA 1st InfDiv is being interviewed. A ranking commander on the ground talking. That's what we need.
The AFP units on the ground are most likely taking action. But crisis situations like this also need to be managed in terms of public info.
What we need is someone ranking in the security/defense to show they're in command &amp; on top of the situation. A local crisis committee even.
With the prez, SND, NSA &amp; AFPCS on official mission abroad, someone would have been designated as OIC in case an emergency like this occurs.
@lloydthelostboy Definitely operational details shouldn't be revealed. It's to show that there's someone ranking in charge &amp; calling shots
Remember Zamboanga siege. We must take all measures to prevent the same from happening to Marawi.
During this time, we need a high ranking defense or military figure  in the country to appear &amp; speak on what's being done in Marawi.

@limbertqc Just part of the job.
@munimunimuna @1nutty_hazel Dapat nga covered din, Pero inamyendahan ko lang naman kasi yung existing Distracted Driving Law.
@madmutt_mark Lahat naman Talaga implementation ang Susi. Pero bilang mambabatas, trabaho namin mag pasa ng batas.
@limbertqc Because standard of safe driving is that both hands must always be on the steering wheel,except when operating a gear or lever.
@limbertqc The law already prohibits the use of electronic devices while driving. But if one is holding a cup, you're still distracted.
@limbertqc Its actually two amendments...the other one is holding other objects while driving. Example is holding a drink while driving.
There's already an existing law. I just proposed an amendment to add a class of distraction. https://t.co/FfVICiKFdt
My amendment does not intend to ban one-ear cellphone headphones. It targets two-ear use of headphones w/c prevent hearing ambient sounds. https://t.co/vTcxF8PbaI
If 1 ear lang, typical of cellphone hands free  kits, it's ok. Hearing of ambient sounds not impeded. https://t.co/in7Wpnn8oN
@1nutty_hazel When I checked the distracted driving law (passed when I wasn't a congressman) , it didn't cover that kind of distraction
@1nutty_hazel There are people like that. That truck driver who recently ran over the old lady was wearing an earphone.
@limbertqc The distracted driving law already covers 2- 3-wheeled vehicles. Same even if my proposed amendment passes.
@1nutty_hazel Let me give an example...a driver who uses earphones to listen to music while driving. That's what is intended to be covered.
Remember, the key phrase in the amendment is "devices which impede hearing ambient sounds" https://t.co/NDI7fUIxPp
Drivers must always have situational awareness while driving. That includes hearing what is going on around him and his vehicle. https://t.co/NDI7fUIxPp
For those asking, what is referred to here are devices w/c impede a driver's ability to hear ambient sounds while driving. https://t.co/NDI7fUIxPp
@1nutty_hazel Key words here are "impede hearing ambient sounds". Drivers must always have situational awareness while driving.
@1nutty_hazel My amendment refers to devices like earphones, headphones, and the like w/c will impede hearing ambient sounds.

This would be consistent with their stated objective of controlling the ocean east of China all the way to the 2nd island chain east of PH.
With CH naval facilities already in WPS, extending their reach to our eastern side is attainable. In short, we would be surrounded.
Once they have mapped out BR, they can begin routine patrols of CH subs in the eastern seaboard of PH. That effectively gives them control.
As mentioned by SND, the CH survey ships may be mapping out the area of Benham Rise in preparation for deployment of submarines in the area.

With this turn of events, the House is set to vote on the DP Bill on 2nd Reading. This locks in the version of the bill to be passed.
Majority leader has called the dare of the opposition to call the roll. Also invoked the rule on cloture, to end period of amendments.
Maneuver, outmaneuver.
The sponsor now parries the repeated and relentless opposition by amendment w/c seeks to delete "death" as a penalty from the bill.
For congressmen faced with difficulty in taking sides on a measure such as DP, avoiding a nominal vote is more attractive.

A motion for nominal voting may be carried if approved by 1/5 of members present, there being a quorum.
The tactic employed is opposition by amendments. It's a way to introduce arguments beyond period of interpellation.
The tactic being used is protracted debate and parliamentary maneuvers to wear out defense and decimate the numbers on the floor.
@maltiq It's like missing out on the beauty of a well executed basketball set play.
This is what makes legislation exciting...the parliamentary skirmishes using parliamentary rules and procedures..

@tinacamusgarcia As far as I'm concerned, I carefully consider the position I take on issues. Not frivolous, always studied.

@tinacamusgarcia My bill is consolidated into the version under consideration.
@tinacamusgarcia From my first term up now (my fourth) , I've been consistent with that.
@tinacamusgarcia Hi! Just to let you know that I filed a bill for death penalty for drug traffickers. That's always been my stand.

Is that how they implement look out bulletins? They don't flag the passport in the system? Just a name given to the front liners?
Apparently,the lookout bulletin on Sombrero didn't include his passport number, full name or other aliases. The order should've included it.
It shouldn't just be the frontline immigration officer who should be answerable for Sombero's exit in spite of look out bulletin.
