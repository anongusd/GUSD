@vince_whirlwind Huh! You know.....is that the same as Secure Family Plus? The Family Map stopped working then shortly after, I got a text saying, "Thanks for adding Secure Family Plus." Then my husband got a call from himself. lol I'm calling them! In the meantime....be careful y'all.
Is it normal to get a call from yourself and when you answer it's ATT saying you're suspended and to enter your login password? NEVER had that happen! Be careful, friends.	Just called my husband to check.......yup, phone works! Not suspended. Scam?
Did anyone see a post on here anywhere about AT&amp;T scammers? We just got a weird call and I think it might have been what was discussed. I can't find the post to recheck! Ugh

@jbmiller45 @dbongino I don't understand why her friends don't help her out a little. BUT, who knows! As the double crossing, triple crossing, octa-crossing, going on right now maybe she's a Conservative sent to make the Dems and Rads look dumb! LOL Dizzy yet?
@BJ_RatedR @SavedByGrace025 @PastorDScott God Bless you, too! All the bickering will be over soon. :)
@PastorDScott I've always thought there was something else going on with him! More often than not, he seemed uncomfortable saying what he did. Could he have gotten in over his head before he realized it was a corrupt system? Not everybody knows what they're doing. Maybe? Let's pray for him.
@SavedByGrace025 @BJ_RatedR @PastorDScott Um, Pastor called him a name. Not a curse word, but still not kind. Just saying. It didn't take long for him to bite back. So I think the tone is clear and wrong. As Christians, it is our duty to inform and question each other so that we do not unintentionally mislead others.
@dbongino No kiddin'. Glad Putin's not dumb or he may have decided to pull the trigger. Though (don't slap me) I'm not worried about him.	Anyway.......too bad we cant get back some of his salary while he was working to screw us over.
@dbongino Oh yeah! I guarantee we're going to be learning of even more people and more criminal activity for years to come. We've just ripped the band-aid off. Let us know when they get ready flush out the wounds with acid. I mean salt. UGH! I mean alcohol. lololol Whatever.
@dbongino Why is her mouth ALWAYS open?!
@PastorDScott Coonman?
I'll answer that.......because they don't want to slow it down. When they do act, it's because the "people" are beginning to notice. Then only reason is a political one. They care about image, not Americans. NOT EVEN children.
Someone's probably mentioned it but......why were we even arguing the definition of a crisis? If you have the option, why not try whatever you can to at least slow the trafficking?

@M2Madness Wait! lol That's right. She's actually telling the truth. She woulda called for war. lol
look at the background of the people who believe in Trump and in Q. We know who Q is. Do you? Look at my background. I'm a dingbat on my own time but I'm not dumb to these things. Have faith until you know there's no faith left. God bless you. Love each other.
too fast and we caught on to exactly how bad and who. We've always known the system was corrupt. Come on! I'm sorry too. It is very sad that we were right. BUT, now we really can face it. Someone DID find a way to fight it and win. See what Q has to show you about them......
They got sloppy. Our technology grew faster than they could create more safeguards and they left trails they weren't competent of completely hiding. So they began making it legal to be "bad." What they forgot.......There are still more good people than bad and they pushed us.....
We're not going to understand all SOPs and REGs but we know human behavior. We know good and bad. Why didn't you see it before now? Because the bad guys worked out all the kinks long before you were born. So why are they fumbling now.........?
need to form your own opinion. It's ok if you don't believe. We've been raised to believe that the people in charge were the 'elite.' Only the elite can do what they do, implying, of course, that if you weren't one of them you simply "can't understand." That's only a little true.
I wish I had 'magical' or 'fancy' words but I don't.....for anyone who might be riding the fence on Trump or Q or whatever, it's ok. NO ONE on those teams are going to demand anything of you. They aren't telling you to believe them. They are helping guide you to the info you
@M2Madness All kidding aside, she really doesn't look well. Wonder if that has anything to do with "Bill and Hillary's 'public' health will be rapidly deteriorating." Is that what was meant you think? Look like crap or just they won't be seen out in public much. What do you think?

@lemke_neil @LouTheCelt @I__LOVE_TRUMP The biggest giveaway that someone hasn't done their research? Because they poke fun. Once somebody sets aside the skepticism a little and spends even just a few minutes reading instead of talking, they cannot deny the validity of Q and the reasons many think JFK Jr. is alive.

@Kimberly__SRB P.S.......But I'm positive, the powers that be on the "good" side are totally on top of it! So much so that the weight of the 'good' is literally so heavy, the bad is being buried as we speak. lol
@Kimberly__SRB Yep. There is quite a bit of evidence that points to that. So far, I've seen that Soros is the top financier of MS13 and the caravans. BUT, if we can openly offer the whole Party an opportunity to benefit, it might change. Not all of them are in the Soros movement.
@Kimberly__SRB But they don't care about lives. Let's find a way that they think they can profit from and then they'll build it!!
@realDonaldTrump Obviously a rhetorical question.....lol......They don't care. Why can't we use the donations from GoFundMe? Please tell people again.
@seanhannity @blkvette I wonder if we can reimbursed for all the tax dollars wasted on the witch hunt.
If you leave it up someone on TV to teach your children how to act, you're a crappy parent. If your children act or behave in a way you approve or do not approve and you give them no feedback one way or the other, you're a crappy parent. It's your baby, you rock it.

The more clips I watch of AOC, the more I feel for her. I think she's probably a nice person and has good energy. When the honeymoon period rubs off and she looks at any of these news clips, she's probably going to feel awful. Good intentions, but she's not ready for Congress.
I guess the oversight committee is trying to be like T. Gowdy. But they suck at it. AND they've been acting like this for awhile now. It has nothing to do with Trump. Sadly, I think it's the same reason toddlers do it. That and jumping on bandwagons. Dumb.

@manzeeno81 @Suisan67 @RealJamesWoods Nonsensical? Try reading your post again. You clearly have a chip on your shoulder. You don't know me either. I was actually trying to help you not be an asshole in case you didn't want to be one. Clearly I wasted my breath.
Ooorah!!!! LOLOL Avoiding military tribunals by stalling, Nancy?? naaaa naa na boo boo!! And as my favorite redneck would say......."She gone!" https://t.co/q98n5xz1c1
@roharmon Yup..........but now I wanna know if it's a boots on the ground sorta bad yet. How involved will my house have to be? ugh
@KathleenJaege13 @MichaelRCaputo @DonaldJTrumpJr It can seem overwhelming at first......don't let it discourage you. Then, think about this........how could it be so elaborate? We've always said politicians are liars/corrupt etc. SO why do we believe them NOW? We were right! They are bad. And they hate Trump. Think.
@KathleenJaege13 @MichaelRCaputo @DonaldJTrumpJr Goodness. To answer your question......never, ever, ever, ever, would I have believed how much horrible manipulation there is......I never would have seen it had I not accepted it as possible. PLEASE find the Q boards. Once you know what to look for you WILL see what we see.
@DonaldJTrumpJr @realDonaldTrump I wish everybody could see what's going on, but it won't happen. Fortunately, there are many more good people than bad. Thank God!!

@ReleaseTheMem12 @LazyMeatball If this is true.......the ONLY thing I can think of to explain it is an upcoming attack on the US. WHO would take their kids and especially grandkids there??? Unless their protected. It'd have to be a major player to do that. But, SHE SAID it's not SAFE HERE? Good God.

You know why it seems some politicians have zero respect for the President? Because we've not had a real President until Trump.
@RealJamesWoods They really are dumb.
Can you imagine all the added pressure on Trump? lol If he doesn't deliver......oh boy. But, he will. He works better, even, under pressure. When has he not? LOL
Well, pretty soon, we won't need a wall. Why? Because no one will want to be here. Good job, Schumer n Pelosi. Good job. Enemies of the State.
@dbongino @BatholithLivin Pelosi and Schumer are more the enemy than Russia or China. But what do I know? I'm a Republican.
The America we wanted doesn't exist. If you want to continue to be able to complain about that, SPEAK UP! What do you want? WHO do you want?

your fellow American democrat. Help them rebuke the evils in their party. GIVE them a voice their leaders have STOLEN.
In many ways, I believe an American democrat personality to be admired. More easily than me, they trust, they hope, they love, they forgive. To recognize that someone would exploit this is hard to remember. That it would be people they love, is almost unthinkable. DO NOT attack..
Lemme tell ya, if I were a criminal and could, I most certainly would aim for the WH. Why does it seem our gov't. is falling apart? Because the criminals, the real criminals, are in a tailspin. What's different? A powerful man that cannot be controlled. Cannot be bought.
Who are 'they' keeping the border open for?? These people are EXPLOITING the trust of their people! They (even for this alone) is criminal.

Give US a better and LOUDER voice! HOW shall we make it any clearer for ALL of you in office??! Work or move out of the way.
I can't believe our America is even having this multitude of a problem within. This is clear evidence that this great country; this world leader......is under attack from enemies within. What does our Constitution demand WE do?
not everyone knows it yet DOES NOT make it less true. You are murderers.
I've lost all hope in reason for Chuck and Nancy. As it should matter what the 'little guy' thinks. @SenSchumer @SpeakerPelosi you are NO better than the men who killed Ofc. Singh. You are NO better than the president you clearly hate. You are an enemy of the people. Just because
@SenSchumer I'm happy you got so much time with your 'genius' grandson while Ofc. Singh's widow goes to bed alone each night. Since you like to toss blame around so freely, I shall call you a Murderer.
I swear, without sarcasm, I truly hear nothing but a "sad, boo hoo, pity" tone about all the suffering of them and the 'people.' I feel bad that there isn't more professional, educated, and experienced representation for the Democratic Party.
@SenSchumer SCARED?? We didn't run off on vacay.
I like Putin waaaaaay better than you.
Is Schumer really at the WH or is that a green screen? WOW! BTW......@SenSchumer you must still be getting your facts from CNN. Trump was elected by people who want the wall. Dumbass
Remember, this is no longer a bipartisan issue. This is basic human behavior. You can either support people who continue to work despite disagreement or support those who leave you when they don't get their way. Because, yes, they have left you. How well can they hear you now?
You know how Pelosi et al can just run off on vacay even though even their "own" Americans are SUFFERING....? Because they KNOW Trump won't do anything nefarious while they're gone. They KNOW Trump is NOT the enemy. They KNOW who IS. And that THEY are in control of that ENEMY
If the Dems wanted a "barrier" before Trump, why aren't they saying, "See, we got him to agree with us! We had the idea first!!"?
If Pelosi et al are still in Puerto Rico......maybe that's where the rest of us need to be. Is it safer there?
I don't think this is about blocking possible democrat votes. I think it's MUCH bigger than that. Think..........what's changed since the $25B offer?
Ask.......why Puerto Rico? Gotta go there to build a 'new' army?
How long would YOU have a job if you didn't show up for work?
Seems to me that the only unreasonable or immoral 'wall' is the Democrat 'wall.'
Federal workers protest government shutdown in Lexington https://t.co/TdcHDPqNKo
There are about 30 of 'them' in Puerto Rico right now, right? Why? Why Puerto Rico??? Something smells funny about that to me......anybody else?
Well, I guess no matter what side you're on, the checks and balances are working. Now what? If Pelosi et al were to concede under the grounds she, 'can't let people starve, anymore,' or 'See, POTUS is reasonable like we said." Kinda seems to me he's giving them plenty of outs.

@realDonaldTrump I know you're busy doing your job beautifully, but if you ever get some down time, could you just follow the Dems around the world on their vacay so you can be there when they get their heads outta their butts and before someone else shoves it back in?
That "United we Stand" thingy??? Or that other thingy, "Divided we Fall." It wasn't a lie.	How's that for nice and simple? I guess Schumer and Nancy think that's just a bunch of bologna.
Good grief!! Every single time I post. Thanks Twitter.
@realDonaldTrump I guess if Russia or China or anybody flexes their muscle, you should just refuse to talk to them and wait for the missiles to hit before you "collude?" Yet more proof we NEED you in office!
I'd rather deal with an angry POTUS than an angry Liberal.
@realDonaldTrump @deanbc1 @foxandfriends I've been told for years that the first sign of an improving economy (at my vantage point) is lower gas prices. Not only have the prices dropped, they've dropped more than I've seen in years. I can still remember $1/gal. in 1997. Is it possible to go that low again?

@realDonaldTrump are 'they' worried about the backlash if they concede? Shall we promise them we won't pour salt in the wounds if they'd just START doing what's right? No, what they're being PAID to do?
There was no collusion. It's called communication. What profit is there in destroying the American economy? Maybe Trump shouldn't have communicated with NK or Cuba or anybody? Stop the nonsense.
Dems......the real enemy is your own. PLEASE, don't believe me. Ask them if they will take you with them on their vacay; ask them to take your family (at least your kids) if you can't afford a vacation.
@marksr1169 Well, I'd do it for as long as I can.........then, when we can't handle it, I'll have to ask for a break. I'm not gonna let my kids suffer the consequences.
@marksr1169 LOL........maybe.
Democrats......where are your leaders? Puerto Rico? WTH? Please tell me why you're ok with that.
Just a thought...........how many people are going to use this shutdown as a bandwagon for sympathy? What else is going to be blamed on this shutdown?
Tears of Democrats are a manufactured crisis by their own leaders. And, believe it, those leaders want it that way.
If you're out of a paycheck and need help......come to my house. You can have dinner with my family. Bring your laundry, too!
So.........tell me. Are we back on the Russian Collusion thing again? Like it or not, Trump ain't the only one owing this shutdown. So, instead "saving the nation," they're chasing a ghost.

@kellyberry404 Egggggsactly! lol
@BryonnyM @starcrosswolf @Acosta @POTUS Well, if you know so much, you fix the problem. And if you wish to keep ANY credibility and thus share an intelligent conversation with anyone............Spend a week near the Mexican border. And since I care about a fellow American, stay on this side. And no weapons allowed.
@CarriesGatos @mitchellvii @lvlvlrd707 Yup. Surely by now they know but just can't stop themselves. They're shooting themselves in the foot but they probably don't care about that either, anymore. They "just want to be heard" how important they are. Reps do the job and Dems won't have anything for us to pity anymore.

I'm curious.....on what grounds would Trump be impeached? It seems a little risky for anyone (including Dems) coming after him. They'd have to maintain a pretty restrictive composure. I mean, the language and the aggressive behavior seem dangerous for a professional.

@whoshekidding @LouiseMensch @realDonaldTrump @SpeakerPelosi IDK......I flip flop on that pretty much every few hours. It depends on whose argument I'm listening to at the time. But, I think most can agree the likelihood is high even if it's a toss up on who will start it. You?
Dems....please answer honestly. The bickering gets us nowhere. I really want to know. In all of the history politics, who has been seen as the most popular and/or the most successful?
@whoshekidding @LouiseMensch @realDonaldTrump @SpeakerPelosi I'm not a follower of politics in general. I care little about state politics. I'm involved in the Border Wall discussions because I have experience and a vested interest in the topic. My emotions fly sometimes like everyone, but I did not insult you. No need.
@2020_blog The person I was talking to about all this blocked me so I guess you can't see the convo. lol
@2020_blog Do you not recognize sarcasm?
NK n SK make up. Cuba relations improved. ISIS nearly obliterated. But we can't reason with Nancy or Chuck.  hmmmm	@realDonaldTrump
@Jazziette THANK you for telling me......I was getting a headache from another conversation. I don't know why I still engage. They just argue not really talk. I guess they just don't really give a damn about the real problem. They just wanna argue/act badly. Ugh.
@socalbarnard @MomRovin @VP @realDonaldTrump @SpeakerPelosi @SenSchumer @DNC @DOJPH @DHSgov THANK YOU. Not to mention your own common sense and efforts to take care of yourself. I guess it was just another example of the typical leftist mindset to make everyone else responsible for everything.
@2020_blog @MomRovin The 'blue' in ladyblue isn't a reference to political party.
@2020_blog @MomRovin Where do you get yours?
@MomRovin Don't need to. I see it first hand.
@2020_blog @MomRovin Personal experience and training.
Do any of the haters have ANY law enforcement experience? Even any basic security experience. There's no way.
I'm betting medical personnel know quite a bit about treating the sick or injured, but I bet LEOs know a crap ton more about the current topic. I mean, we are talking about criminals killing some of the most patriotic people we have. And our children...........
We don't want criminals to kill us but we'll stop looking for E. Coli https://t.co/64WkG6qgW9

@MomRovin Well, you keep showing me news articles. Forget those. What in your day to day tells you we don't need secure the border better?
@Jazziette Yeah. It's so sad. If they could just look for themselves. What about tent city? We can't help those people, and they want to bring in more? Inaction is irresponsible.
@MomRovin Again........you're relying on media. If you can't give me something different than articles, I'm not discussing it. I'm not here to be nasty. You're an American and I'm an American. Period. I vehemently believe the Left is wrong.
@kellyberry404 ???? I guess I'm having a brain fart. I'm not following your response.
@MomRovin @VP @realDonaldTrump @SpeakerPelosi @SenSchumer @DNC @DOJPH @DHSgov Oh, stop. That slips through at various times when the govt is working at full capacity anyway. If it concerns you.........he canned food or food purchased before all this. Just saying.................You're an adult. You should already be taking care of yourself anyway
@MomRovin @VP @realDonaldTrump @SpeakerPelosi @SenSchumer @DNC @DOJPH @DHSgov Please stop letting someone else tell you what is or is not going on and you take such a strong stance. Please make sure you've not been manipulated or misinformed even accidently before you get upset.
I'm sorry we failed you and your families. https://t.co/m0CydTs1LU

@MomRovin @VP @realDonaldTrump @SpeakerPelosi @SenSchumer @DNC @DOJPH @DHSgov LOL yes....it will be. PLEASE..........take emotion or loyalty or whatever out of the equation. WHY is it so important NOT to build a wall?
@MomRovin @VP @realDonaldTrump @SpeakerPelosi @SenSchumer @DNC @DOJPH @DHSgov If Dems wanted to protect this country, they'd give him money for the wall which would also get the country back to regular operation. BTW.....only a fraction of it is down.

@VP @realDonaldTrump @SpeakerPelosi @SenSchumer @DNC @DOJPH @DHSgov
And as we wait...........our enemies. Our REAL enemies are watching. They know the wall is inevitable. What do you think the likelihood is that they are stepping up their efforts and number to get in before it's closed????
The majority of Americans ARE good people AND they are suffering over this. Deal with Trump or deal with us AND him. We will not fail our kids. We will not fail our LEOs. We will not fail the needs of the whole for the incompetency between any party like this.
@LouiseMensch @realDonaldTrump @SpeakerPelosi And you will see a civil war like no other. AND the wall will be built, still.
@realDonaldTrump Please televise the discussions with them again. Please. Show everybody how they talk to you.
Televise the meetings again!!!! Show the people more.
I got an idea. Build a wall between CA and the rest of the nation. Apparently, we need protection from them, too.

@MaryRWilliams4 Oh, of course! But narcotics, alcohol, etc. play a huge part (if not majority) in creating it. If the supply is hampered, related crimes are decreased. The number of drugs made here is miniscule compared to what comes through our borders. And the sex trade. Don't we have to try??
@MaryRWilliams4 Obviously, I don't know where you live, but if you can, it might be helpful to go there and check it out. It's horrible.
@MaryRWilliams4 I hate arguing and I'm sorry, but that article and the like are horribly misleading and intentionally presenting bias. BUT, think a little bit more. The number only seems higher because they ARE BEING CAUGHT. Ex: If cops made no DUI arrests it wouldn't mean they don't exist
@MaryRWilliams4 ....forget either one of them for a sec. Do you agree there are violent people and illicit drugs, etc. coming through Mexico? Why is it a bad thing to do more as the number of the criminal population grows? What if you're wrong? What are the consequences of that?
@MaryRWilliams4 I don't understand why you think you know for certain what he has done and what he is thinking? I don't get it. I did not hear him say Mexico is deliberately sending them here. I did hear he said they're not helping so with inaction they are condoning it. How about this instead..
@MaryRWilliams4 And, honestly.....the verbal push and shove from ANYbody means nothing to me if they're not lying. And I know Trump is not lying.
@MaryRWilliams4 Because it's true. He was giving specifics and statistics to explain why it's necessary. He is supposed to do that. Schumer said he provided no facts, but he DID. Then he tugged at heartstrings saying (paraphrasing) our lives will go to to Hell under a tyrant. AND he lied!
@MaryRWilliams4 Wait, what? Why the reference to Krushchev?
@MaryRWilliams4 Did you watch his statement tonight after Trump?
@MaryRWilliams4 Are you freakin serious right now???? Do you know what the word "motherf'er" is?? Good Lord, Democrats haven't?? Your own representative is still TELLING you to believe that. HE"S lying. I was trying to be NICE in my post and u snap back. WTH?
@MaryRWilliams4 You didn't find the right source.............the facts say it is effective, is necessary. BTW........even they said this. Check it. They didn't just wake up and grow some morals. It's not about that!
Don't get me wrong........I like turds....you can get rid of them and ya feel better when you do! lololol		Ok, Ok.....I'm done. lol
I sh** you not!
OOPs...... by "it" I mean Schumer. lol
Polish a turd and it's still a turd. lol
@Lexa_Merica @Libra5405 He better know how to run fast!
@MaddowBlog @MaryRWilliams4 LMAO!! You're in front of the camera way more than Trump, drama queen.
Anybody own a charter bus???
Please don't let anyone manipulate you and exploit you. Don't let them give "facts" and not fact check on your own and it's never been more important than now. Your lives really may depend on it!
Wow. Schumer said the President did not provide facts, yet he did. Schumer did not. Schumer accused the President of using fear tactics...........Good God! All Schumer did! Does he not hear himself??? Does he think Democrats don't watch anyone but him?? or they're stupid?
@RedWingGrip @Maggieb1B @Acosta @realDonaldTrump You don't have to like him to see the man has some major testicles! lol Don't hate me for saying this because I almost love our golden hero........and I don't like Acosta but I would have done the same thing. I saw it as a reflex I don't blame the female nor does Acosta.
@marklevinshow Why do people need to keep asking that? Not that he can't make a mistake but wow. He's not dumb. How many advisers does he have?? Forget the sarcasm, I would love to know the number!

@jordanbpeterson Could you not carry mirrors and hearing aids to provide some of the people who debate with you?? I've never heard you speak before today, but it took me very little time to see that their failure to understand your points is their failure, not yours. :)
In all honesty and fairness because that's what I preach.........I think you deserve more and better representation. So far, I think we have a better chance than ever at a better life. IF I ever learn Trump is not sincere, I will apologize. Let's watch together. Ok?
My very sincere wish for you (and even prayer for all of us): We must be strong but we must also take the time to notice if our passions are being given the real respect and chance they deserve most importantly from our own party. Please, demand competence and results.
Trying to get off here, swear. Just one more....Dems, I'm not asking you to change your policies simply to fit mine or close to mine. I would NEVER as anyone to give up what they honestly believe is the right thing. And you are a very driven group of people. That's to be admired.
@US_of_A_1st @hirschA8720 I'm actually very suspicious of her win. I was born in Michigan and have quite a bit of family still there along with some friends.

You can get get great tips on "situational awareness" for your everyday routine with just some Internet searches. Don't be nervous, just informed.
I'm not in a panic, but I can't shake the idea that there's something else up with Schumer and Pelosi. As much as I dislike them, I can't really say those two are dumb anymore and be honest. Don't get sucked in too much! Watch ALL borders until we find out what's really going on.

@realDonaldTrump @wvufanagent99a Green is such a horrible color. Can't wait to see the orange shirts, too!
@realDonaldTrump @LouDobbs LOL Funny some should call you unethical by giving an opinion on a BOOK. I think they're confused. It's book banning that is unethical. Heaven forbid you say something nice to a friend.

I am so unbelievably happy to have outlets such as Twitter to interact, release some steam or see justice and the end of the curse. Today, though, I want to tell all of my fellow patriots......Stay strong, we are in good hands, and I love you.

@GrooganFox26 @Joyful_33 @DanCrenshawTX Love this guy, too! I'm being dead serious, too, when I say I think he has a Presidential face. Anybody?
@ubzervr Yup and who could blame them. There are alot of smart and alot of strong and good people in this country. But, I'm not sure how many are out there that have the intellect, ego, humor, experience, tenacity, etc all in one. I cringe sometimes saying it but it's almost magical. lol
@dbongino EVERYONE knows this is a pissing contest. Without sarcasm, I truly believe she may need an evaluation. I can't get past the feeling that she's not a clown but more a puppet and I tend to feel bad for her when I see this.
@dbongino Well.......this has ALWAYS BEEN the argument. Our various interpretations of what we can do and what we can't do. So......let's keep it simple. There is documented, factual data, not to mention COMMON sense that shows borders are necessary and FACT there is a duty to protect.....
@thehill Uhhh, what? Noooooo....... The Constitution (SOP) requires (and allows) you to challenge him but you will NEVER be his equal in any sense of the word. You are trying to have pissing contest. You have already failed OUR Constitution and thus should be removed. Already. lol

No matter what side you're on, I think there's one burning question we should ask ourselves........why do we let OUR ELECTED officials operate this way? How much do you think their stubbornness affects THEM? Make them do their job. ALL of them.
Surely we have some billionaires out there who don't mind donating for the wall. Can they donate anonymously or is there some sort of left wing mess that would prevent it?
@ArmyBratt68 @Bellajane127 Absolutely! It's gonna be horrible for alot of people but, in the end, it may turn out to lead to some unexpected positive outcomes for everyone, Americans and immigrants. I doubt it would have to be closed very long at all.

@seanhannity Don't any of you agree the real and worst enemies of all of us hardly show their faces? What? You can't see them so they don't exist? What do you think it does to your safety to fight like this? They want us all dead and we're doing most the work for them.

JFK wasn't perfect but I wish I could see that type of Democrat again. He tried to keep the country united.
@meowcat3712 @81markyboy81 @realDonaldTrump "Trying"....probably should be added. I'm keeping my mind open as best I can but I'm not going to condemn a man because of something he "might" have done.

Can we not get rid of the people responsible for this??? What about harassment and filing a false report? Inciting a Riot? How about Complicity?GET RID OF THESE PEOPLE NOW!!!
@Golfinggary5222 @ArizonaKayte Technically it can happen. But, whatever the case, Kavanaugh should NEVER have been treated this way. It's my belief she didn't really want to pursue it this far. She seems to have been under serious pressure. Disgusting.
@Jamierodr10 @ROHLL5 For clarification.....I'm not against Dr. Ford. I'm against the fact that she just got so much. I've seen babies with terminal illness get nothing.

@ManWitch89 @UmbertoBagg @MattxRed @Emma4Change I was being a little defensive. I'm not sure that's the word.....anyway, no. It's impossible to know.

I support Trump. Not because I'm Republican or because he does everything the way I like. When he makes mistakes, I won't condemn everything he does. I'm not in the position to know nor are most who hate him so much they want him dead. Speak your mind but please stop the hate!!!
@snyderjo1 The players infuriated me, too. But, I agree he shouldn't express such a strong personal opion while POTUS. In his defense, he has no prior experience. Do you think he's being treated differently than prior presidents?
@snyderjo1 I don't remember that but I'd have to hear it to know if he meant it as a call to brutality. I was a cop for a long time and there were many, many, many times officers were attacked because they were second-guessing everything they did because they didn't want to lose their job.
@ToddPruett4 Yeah, I know. Still sucks. lol
@snyderjo1 I've not heard him call for police brutality. I have heard him say enough was enough and that we must stop the attacks on police. It took him a bit so who knows for sure.
@snyderjo1 IDK....I'm not sure if it's his intent to cause strife or if people are overreacting to what they have been told or actually know. I gave him the benefit of the doubt with lack of political experience and such until the b.s. with N.K. and Russia. Then Kim K. Idk anymore.
@snyderjo1 Who does? Trump?
@snyderjo1 I understand it's a protection from government. I'm not asking the WH to get involved. What I'm arguing, admittedly not very well, is the everyday rampant hate that's saturated our lives. People want to argue and fight (often violently) when there are better ways.

@ZackTheKack @davidhogg111 @realDonaldTrump I wonder what it would be like with less gun control and maybe a couple others.

@realDonaldTrump I know how you can use MSM to make a real difference with LEOs and our communities and them not even know until it's too late!
Mr. President, we love you but do you only give your time to celebrities? Us little people have very good and very real solutions for change that you're missing out on! @realDonaldTrump
WAIT!! But you know that already, don't you? How many marches have there been for your right to free speech??? Crazy.
@therealroseanne
To the radical Dems (and CNN) who hate everybody........It's "Freedom of Speech" not "Freedom to Bitch."
Remember when we felt we had to protect ourselves from "the man"? Now it's more like we have to protect ourselves from our "fellow man." Which one do you think is better?

@southernkittyc1 Great. Everyday, I'm seeing more and more reasons we should give California extra chemtrail shots. Wait, maybe this craziness is actually a result of the smog problem Californians warned was poisoning everyone. Now it's, 'Told you so. Now, give us everything we want.'

Yet another question.......Can we not cut out the "middle man" for SOME issues? These officials are in our employ. Regardless who's right who's wrong, they've become ineffective (not on everything!!) and it's costing lives!! Washington, let us ALL vote when you deadlock!!!???
What if........., civilians volunteered to fill in some of the gaps? For schools who don't have SROs, would it help to allow people in those communities volunteer their time as security at least temporarily??? I bet many people would.

@ECMcLaughlin @maddow I understand why people want better gun control, but restricting access to them won't stop incidents like the school shootings. They're planned. If they can't get a gun, they'd buy or build something else to use. Gun control helps (will only help) in the heat of the moment.
