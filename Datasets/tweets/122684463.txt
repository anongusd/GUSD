That isn't Badger red that the protesters in Mad Town  are wearing. That is commie red.
The supreme court is looking into Obama's eligibility Just saw it on Drudge Report..  Will they have the guts to do the right thing.
I am confused. It was good when they protested Pres. Bush. It was bad when the Tea Party protested. Now it is good when they protest in WI.
http://www.itstaetime.org    buy a flag and fly it and wave it and stop letting them intimidate you!
Wake up! They are killing the Tea Party Movement. We are letting them. Stand up and say No!  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKvc1Wmz6II

Too bad for him the greatest, most storied franchise kicked the Bears butt in the Championship. Go Pack Go.
Why a Bears fan? Oh I know why. Because the Bears had a chance to go to the Superbowl and that meant he could insert himself into the game.
Or when he lived in New York.  Why didn't he become a Chiefs fan? Or a Jets fan? Or a Giants fan?
Maybe he became a Bear fan when he lived in Kansas.
Maybe when he lived in Indonesia. There must be a lot of Bear fans in Indonesia.
Did he become a Bear fan when he lived in Hawaii? Are there a lot of Bear fans in Hawaii?
Doesn't that make more sense? The Obama's would back the Lye'ins? I mean Lions.
Was his Dad a Bear fan in Kenya? You would think he would be a Lion fan.
How did he become a Bear fan?
Does anyone really believe Obama is a Bear fan?

We need the biggest Tea Parties ever this year.
Go You Packers Go Go!
It is so obvious that the commies are trying to take out the U.S.
http://t.co/CNIJ2qA via @guardian A communist giving a dinner for a communist. Disgusting seeing a commie flag on the Whitehouse.
Communism is still the enemy of mankind no matter how they try and package it now days. 	http://www.itsteatime.org http://disq.us/wbyyf
If we got into a war with the Chicoms all we would have to do is air drop weapons to the Chinese people and let them â€¦ http://disq.us/wbyrh
Obama goes on vacation. Suddenly the Gov. of Hawaii says he is going to prove he was born here. Hmmm, I think maybe they planned that.
Also fly our flags or any Tea Party flag to show we are not alone.	And we are growing! http://www.itsteatime.org
Visit our site at http://www.itsteatime.org read the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution and our own Proclamation.
There is nothing good that comes from communism.
We must not be polite, we must not let them act superior at schools and tell them when we are upset with the curriculum. Communism is wrong.
We must fight back this year. We must have the biggest Tea Parties we have ever had this year. We must boldly stand up to "progressives."
Regresses sing back from power of the people to power of the State.
How much progress is it going from freedom to Tyranny?  There is nothing progressive about their ideology. They are regressive.
Because they are communists pure and simple. They are not liberals.Liberals never wanted to control people. They are not progressive.
We respect our Founding Fathers so much how could anyone not. How could they think Marx is a hero and George Washington is a villain.
We love our country so much we do not understand that there are so many among us who loathe it. How could it be?
Are we what the At tourney General  called us?  Are we cowards? I think not. I think we are polite. I think we we just don't understand.
Are we weak?
Why?
We let the news become propaganda and we do not demand the truth, we still buy their papers, we still buy the advertisers products.
They say that communism/socialism is just another form of government not what it really is and we do not correct them.
They go to foreign lands and apologies for our greatness and insult the citizens of our great country and we still do not speak up.
They get rid of the National anthem before football games and we do not notice. They insult the people of our country still we take it.
They have made freedom a dirty word. They take parts out of the Declaration of Independence and we still sit idly by.
They tell us we are extreme and not mainstream when we say we do not want the government to control our lives and livelihoods.
Communists in our schools  have changed our heroes to villains and our villains to heroes  yet we still say nothing.
Communists have infiltrated our schools, we ignored them. They changed our school books. We said nothing.
Those they can not change they will eliminate
Communism/socialism is contrary to our constitution therefore it is treason! They will not stop until they turn us into commies.
Glenn Beck is a great guy but he is getting to philosophical. We have to stand up to these communists, not just pray for them.
It is not that we do not want to become socialists, look around we already are, we want to get rid of socialism in our great country.
They accuse us of wanting to stifle free speech then they make laws that stifle free speech as in "hate speech."
They accused President Bush of spying on Americans then they really do spy on Americans.
They call us fascists then they partner with business with government having a controlling interest.  That is what fascism is.

What is liberal about socialism?  Nothing.	"The goal of socialism is communism."   Vladimir Lenin
Everyone on our side isn't conservative. But we all have love of liberty in common. is what we need to restore.Liberty
The other side is not liberals. Read the true definition. The other side is totalitarian. Do not let them have that word.
No hill is too small to die on anymore. Stop being polite. Tell them when they are wrong.
They are stopping our drilling. The rest of the countries are still drilling. They are tanking our country on purpose. Wake up.
Chicago politics have become American policy. That is sad,
Do not let the press paint the Tea Party into a corner when it comes to issues. Liberty should be our issue. It solves every argument.
Why don't they have beer at Tea Party Rallies? Our Founding Fathers planned the Revolution over beers.
The most corrupt administration ever.
The Tea Party Movement is supposed to save Capitalism, why do some members respect p. a. c. s more than capitalists.
