"With a wall they want to be stingy, but we have options that most people don’t really understand," President Trump says of the spending deal he hasn't openly committed to signing. He could still use an executive action to supplement its $1.375 billion in wall money if he signs.
President Trump intends to sign the border wall deal that will avoid another government shutdown this week, sources tell @DanaBashCNN. That does not mean he has ruled out using executive action to try to get even more funding for his border wall, however.

President Trump is suggesting on Fox News Sunday that the first lady came to him first to ask if she could go public with her feud with Mira Ricardel this week: "They came to me. They wanted to go a little bit public because that’s the way they felt and I thought it was fine."
Trump slams the NYT story about  Pence's loyalty: "They should retract that story...You can’t do that story without calling me for a quote. Or you could call Sarah Huckabee.” But Hogan, a WH spox, DID give a quote for the story...so the reporters did call.
Trump on whether the Saudis will face further punishments over the Khashoggi murder: "They give us a lot of jobs, they give us a lot of business, a lot of economic development...I’m President. I have to take a lot of things into consideration."
President Trump says the CIA will be briefing him on Khashoggi today on AF1, but says he hasn't yet been briefed on whether MBS had direct involvement in ordering the Saudi journalist killed.
VP Pence suggests there may be consequences for MBS on the heels of reports that he ordered the murder of Khashoggi: "The United States is determined to hold all of those accountable who are responsible for that murder."

Mira Ricardel is sitting in her office and has not been fired, a senior WH official tells me and @jeffzeleny.

From @KateBennett_DC: Melania Trump's spokeswoman is now saying Mira Ricardel should be fired: “It is the position of the Office of the First Lady that she no longer deserves the honor of serving in this White House.” Ricardel, a national security aide, was at a WH event today.

A White House official concedes to @jeffzeleny that the Ford hearing was "terrible for Brett." President Trump was observing from the White House, and he watched the proceedings in silence.
Sen. Lindsey Graham continues to describe the Ford allegation as a delay tactic by the Democrats, an argument that obscures the fact that the GOP has the power to confirm Kavanaugh today if the votes were there. His nomination is in danger bc of other Republicans, not Democrats.
Dr. Ford's testimony is compelling -- but she hasn't added any new facts to her story. Kavanaugh's denial is not likely to change either. So after the dust settles, it will still come down to everyone's subjective perceptions of which person performed better.

The first time I ever went on TV I was so nervous I was shaking, and Charles was the only person in a crowded green room who noticed and came over to see what was wrong. I told him I'd never done this before, and he offered some advice.

April 29, on Face the Nation:		Q: "Is it a requirement that Kim Jong Un agree to give away those weapons before you give any kind of concession?" 		Bolton: "I think that's right. I think we're looking at the Libya model of 2003, 2004." https://t.co/dWPnJB3cIR
"I think when John Bolton made that statement, he was talking about if we're going to be having a problem...it's really just the opposite." Trump says of why Bolton said WH is following Libya 2003 model in talks with NK (that is not the context in which Bolton made those remarks)
Trump says of ZTE: "It's just a small component of the overall deal." This as Rs/other administration officials have tried to describe ZTE only as an enforcement action, not as a concession in broader trade talks w/ China

The latest Mueller indictment undermines parts of BOTH the Democrats' collusion narrative AND the Republicans' dismissal of Russian meddling. Not a clean win for either side: https://t.co/YFkgh9z4i4
@BlackBelted The point I'm making is that Mueller's investigation is far from being over, because we don't have any indictments related to the most damaging set of Russian activities yet
What the Mueller indictment does not seem to address: hacking into the DNC, hacking into Podesta's inbox, leaking stolen emails to hostile websites. That was always the most significant actual crime we know Russians committed, so we are far from having all the answers.
@BrendanBordelon I'm just referring to what narrative this indictment supports or does not support. This indictment says explicitly there was no collusion, a subsequent indictment could say something different.
This indictment is proving why right-wing attacks on Mueller's credibility are wrong. The indictment supports neither side's narrative: yes, Russia meddled in the election &amp; sought to help Trump BUT no, the Trump campaign did not collude &amp; Russians targeted other candidates too
An enormously significant point: The Mueller indictment describes the Trump associates who worked w/ Russians as "unwitting." That seems to be a major blow to the collusion narrative. https://t.co/0zwub3g7ZA

Will be illustrative to see if Schiff memo is properly labeled as "disputed" in every chyron and headline, as the Nunes memo is rightfully being described today.
RT @BrendanBordelon: Hooo boy. Transcript time. https://t.co/DVSdzVUQVT
Key part of the #memo involves the DOJ's failure to disclose to FISC the ties between Steele and the Clinton campaign, EVEN AFTER terminating the FBI's relationship w/ Steele bc he leaked to media &amp; demonstrated anti-Trump bias https://t.co/Kf2pXEa0G6
@nutzopalace I'm not pro-memo or anti-memo I just think if you are automatically writing the memo off as a fake because it helps one side then you aren't covering it fairly
Republicans' questions about the Steele dossier/FBI would have more credibility if more Rs were making this distinction clear: https://t.co/qS5q3onGYx
As if #MemoDay couldn't get any more exciting https://t.co/K8DtXC1VIy
This is a totally misleading statement. The Free Beacon hired Fusion GPS to research  Republican primary candidates, Trump included. Steele was not even hired by Fusion GPS until DNC/Clinton paid for *Trump specific* dirt. Free Beacon contract and Steele are unrelated. https://t.co/t3XtN7AmCI
RT @MikeDelMoro: Developing: everyone on twitter is now an attorney
This also seems problematic: In order to corroborate the dossier, the FBI "extensively" cited a news article -- that was based entirely on the dossier. In effect, using the dossier to corroborate the dossier. https://t.co/nsHt76J4G1
Also seems to make a good case for releasing the underlying FISA application. Either the Clinton connection was disclosed or it wasn't -- not something either party can really distort for long. https://t.co/HTYEmrG568
This seems like the most damning section: There was no reason not to disclose the relationship between Clinton and Steele. https://t.co/WAxrsrecT0
"The political origins of the Steele dossier were known to senior DOJ and FBI officials, but excluded from the FISA applications." This is the whole story. @ByronYork https://t.co/Ix8zBjHNuF
@DoriToribio My only point is, there are lots of folks in media today who are reflexively defending the government here as if there is no possible way the government could ever do wrong. There's more than enough reason to be skeptical of both sides in this situation.
What's often overlooked when people make this argument is the fact that we still don't know if the judge was made aware that the opposing campaign had paid for this dossier. That relationship should have been disclosed. https://t.co/laA0ZmRPr2
@DoriToribio Drunken, second-hand conversation is not "testimony"
Because if FBI had to rely in part on this opposition research, it means the evidence they had independently collected to that point was not enough to justify spying. To the best public info we have at the moment, investigators STILL haven't corroborated all of the dossier. https://t.co/f8qdQm3T6z
Several things can be true at once: 1. Some Republicans are weaponizing the memo for partisan reasons 2. This memo probably won't live up to the hype 3. If the memo shows that FBI used the Clinton-funded dossier -- in any way -- to get a FISA warrant, that is problematic. Period.

Buzzfeed got a lot of heat for releasing the dossier, but in hindsight they prevented it from taking on the kind of conspiracy-laden mystique that surrounds the memo. And publishing the dossier accelerated the process of us finding out how it was created &amp; how it was being used
Releasing the memo feels a lot like releasing the dossier... so much public interest in it that it just makes sense to get it out there at this point, because keeping it secret could allow conspiracy theories to grow.

The FBI has also investigated Shearer for a potential Logan Act violation in the past. And Shearer's habit of preparing dossiers for Clinton stretches back to her State Dept days, when he and Blumenthal sent her unvetted memos in Libya https://t.co/U9TqxkicAA https://t.co/yDhthA599t
That's partly because the campaign contributions McAuliffe gave to McCabe's wife have been public knowledge for more than a year, and yet Wray threatened to resign in order to protect McCabe anyway. So Wray likely learned something new and worse from the IG.
It is very consequential for the McCabe removal to have come about as a result of the forthcoming IG report on alleged FBI bias -- and not from the Nunes memo. Unlike the House Intel Committee, the DOJ IG has unimpeachable nonpartisan credentials. https://t.co/PGnvkh1FnV

This will be particularly damaging to the probe's credibility if Schneiderman is involved in any charges that are not related to Russia.
And that could finally gives Rs an opening to defend Trump against an aspect of the Russia probe where there wasn't one before.
The argument in defense of Mueller -- that he has unimpeachable objectivity -- doesn't apply to Schneiderman.
That's why having Schneiderman involved in the case may be a good thing for Trump: it gives him the partisan foil that Mueller never was
