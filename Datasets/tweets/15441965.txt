Cohen reaches for his Watergate moment, tells House Republicans his core mistake was previously doing what *they are doing right now* ‚Äî gambling everything to protect Trump when they know better.		(paraphrase)
The committee has a major witness in *both* the Mueller and SDNY probe under oath, before he reports to prison, and (some) members (in both parties) are using this scarce time to debate each other?
Consider what‚Äôs happening now:		The former DNC Chair, who was ousted over hacked DNC emails, is questioning a former lawyer for Trump, who was disbarred and convicted partly over his work for Trump‚Äôs campaign, on his eyewitness claim that Trump knew of that DNC hack in advance.
Dem Chair Cummings tells Cohen:		If you lie today, I‚Äôll refer you back to the Feds to be prosecuted again.
Some keys for Cohen hearing:		Did Trump and Stone do any more talking or planning about Wikileaks beyond this one alleged call?		Did Cohen observe Trump obstructing justice in NY before 2017, or in DC after?		Did the Trump Org or other companies subsidize the Trump Campaign?

Today WH says Trump will "take other executive action - including a national emergency" to stop the border "crisis."		We will see what that executive action actually is, whether it tries to use funds or methods that would not typically be lawful, and report the facts from there..
This is simple.		Presidents can argue something is a "national emergency."		But using that argument for action that is not otherwise lawful -- like spending money Congress did not authorize by law -- comes down to whether the the *courts* decide it is a national emergency.

The top story tonight on The Beat:		Bob Mueller indicting Trump's longest serving political adviser for obstruction, tampering and lying about efforts to get Clinton's stolen emails -- the *6th Trump associate* indicted to date.		(Not temporary funding for the government.)
Is Trump totally *caving* on the wall for short-term government funding a prelude to him caving on the wall for long-term government funding?
Mueller does *not* allege an election conspiracy or any knowledge by Trump in today's indictment. That's an important distinction that may benefit Trump and the WH. Mueller *does* allege, for the first time, the Trump Campaign was in the loop about Stone's efforts.
Today is the first Mueller indictment of a Trump associate that directly relates to the stolen Clinton emails -- alleging Stone sought specific stolen emails and kept some Trump officials in the loop.
Roger Stone is now the *sixth* Trump associate Mueller has indicted -- in a probe that remains open and continues to gather evidence.

None of which is to suggest Barr isn‚Äôt up to the job. He‚Äôs a widely respected attorney (as we‚Äôve noted on air). 		But these are self-contradictory claims, with a factual error, about a *core act under investigation in the Mueller probe* ‚Äî the firing of FBI Director Comey.
So Barr‚Äôs reversal ‚Äî saying ‚ÄòComey was right‚Äô until it became Trump‚Äôs (initial) excuse for firing Comey, then saying ‚ÄòComey was wrong‚Äô ‚Äî relies on something that was not true. 		Questioning why Barr claimed otherwise, and his motivations, could be a fruitful avenue under oath.
Barr defends his reversal by claiming he thought DOJ authorized Comey‚Äôs July statement on Clinton ‚Äî but Comey said the *opposite* at the top of that address:		‚ÄúI have not coordinated or reviewed this statement in any way with the DOJ.. They do not know what I am about to say.‚Äù
Both assertions came in WashPo op-eds he wrote defending Republicans at key inflection points, the final week of the 2016 campaign an days after the Comey firing. Headlines:		‚ÄúCOMEY DID THE RIGHT THING‚Äù (10/16)		‚ÄúTRUMP MADE RIGHT CALL ON [FIRING] COMEY‚Äù (5/17)
Senators may also question why...		Barr went from praising Comey in Oct. 2016, saying his announcing no charges against Clinton did not appear to usurp power ‚Äî to  citing that same action as ‚Äúcrossing a line‚Äù that justified Trump firing him.

The big Q is whether enough bubbles pop to inoculate people against Trump‚Äôs lies *going forward*		Trump U. is the classic example. It not only failed, but left some of Trump‚Äôs biggest fans ‚Äî paying Trump U. customers ‚Äî angrily demanding their money back from him		And they got it.
And as President, Trump has proven to be both canny and impulsive ‚Äî it‚Äôs obviously against his political self-interest to be forcing a made-up shutdown during this market drop, apparently from impulse; while he continues to try to beat back legal accountability with his AG picks.
It‚Äôs not exactly a ‚Äògood thing‚Äô that courts and markets provide faster backlash than other parts of our democratic system ‚Äî any con man can see the other areas where lies work with more impunity and focus on exploiting those ‚Äî but it‚Äôs telling that Trump is hurting in these areas

So even one argues Trump has ‚Äúgotten away‚Äù with more lies than a typical POTUS ‚Äî sanctioned less by the political system, paying less of a price with his base (while Bush was pummeled for 1 lie about new taxes) ‚Äî consider the two areas where Trump is facing swift backlash...
This approach can shape public opinion in the short run, but that ‚Äúpropaganda effect‚Äù feeds bubbles which can eventually pop. Some things are easier to lie about than others...

Prosecutors argue Cohen‚Äôs crimes, taken together, reveal a knowing effort to ‚Äúundermine core institutions of our democracy.‚Äù
‚ÄúCohen deceived the voting public by hiding alleged facts that he believed would have had a substantial effect on the election.‚Äù
NY prosecutors: Cohen‚Äôs campaign crimes for Trump ‚Äústruck a blow to one of the core goals of the federal campaign finance laws: transparency.‚Äù
Breaking in NY prosecutors new filing: 		‚ÄúMichael Cohen‚Äôs decision to plead guilty rather than seek a pardon for his manifold crimes does not make him a hero.‚Äù		They ask the judge to imprison him for about 4 years.
New: Federal prosecutors in NY unimpressed with Cohen‚Äôs DMX defense, they recommend a ‚Äúsubstantial‚Äù term of about four years in jail.
Now: James Comey praises William Barr‚Äôs credentials.		Notable since Comey is quite clear about publicly calling out many Trump efforts to undercut the rule of law or the DOJ‚Äôs independence.

An alternative theory ‚Äî which the Senate can probe at confirmation ‚Äî is that Trump and Barr already agree about limits or ‚Äúred lines‚Äù for the Russia probe, or Trump demanded assurances on those issues. He‚Äôs already under investigation for demanding loyalty from the FBI.
Barr is not someone you pick to improperly kneecap the DOJ. Trump has previously been on a ‚Äúwar‚Äù footing, trying to oust Mueller, blasting Sessions for recusal ‚Äî does he now believe (rightly or wrongly) that he‚Äôs legally in the clear, so he‚Äôs no longer seeking a loyalist for AG?
Notable that even as Mueller bears down on convicted former Trump aides like Cohen and Manafort, Trump is now moving towards a *more traditional, Bush-era lawyer* to run the DOJ ‚Äî rather than a loyalist (Whitaker) or far right politician (Sessions)...
William Barr is an experienced, mainstream conservative choice for A.G. ‚Äî less ideologically extreme than Sessions, far more qualified than Whitaker.

RT @PostOpinions: What it means for democracy if losers of elections don‚Äôt relinquish power, @AriMelber writes https://t.co/keaQHvk54V
To protect democracy, these anti-democratic schemes must not only lose in the courts and in public opinion. They must be punished so aggressively,  by judges and voters, that this is no longer considered any kind of legitimate option in the first place.		https://t.co/2OvC7rr5va
Put ethics to the side, and perhaps it's not surprising that a party struggling to achieve national electoral majorities ‚Äî Republicans won *fewer* votes than Democrats in *6 of the past 7* presidential races ‚Äî is using tricks to cement power that cannot be won at the ballot box.
Republicans in WI also deploy gerrymandering to rig the outcomes of their elections.		More WI voters backed Democrats in their state assembly races last month -- but the GOP was still able to ‚Äúwin‚Äù control of 64% of the district seats.
Some argue the WI legislature has the power to reform these offices. That may be technically accurate, but misses the point. The legislature has powers to organize the gov. 		The issue is whether explicitly legislating to undermine election results is an *abuse* of those powers.
The GOP ploy in Wisconsin, echoing Republicans in N. Carolina, is *not* part of a ‚Äúcycle of partisan warfare.‚Äù It is not ‚Äúanother round‚Äù of political payback that pundits can debate through the narrow lens of clever strategy. 		It is antithetical to democracy.

Cohen‚Äôs lawyer also argues @THEREALSWIZZZ paid over half a million in back taxes and did no time.		This raises the question, does Cohen‚Äôs lawyer know *Swizz produced DMX‚Äôs Ruff Ryders Anthem,* gesturing towards a blending of both musical style and tax evasion style? https://t.co/iAmts4eEgm

Fmr counsel to several state impeachment cases: https://t.co/9HZWa1vDmM
Remember, whatever Don McGahn knows, Mueller knows.
There are no known criminal investigations into Clinton or Comey now, but the Trump DOJ *is* criminally investigating Comey's deputy, McCabe - who was fierd after a public campaign by Trump. 		Allegations of potentially illegal "payback" probes are not theoretical at this point.
Comey is at *the center* of the Russia probe.		Trump not only fired him, and linked the firing to the probe, but then allegedly sought to get Comey prosecuted.		So this new report is right in Mueller's strike zone -- he can investigate this as part of alleged obstruction.
So Trump's *own* lawyers warned him that this investigation request was not only unlawful -- he does not have that power under law -- but that it could trigger "impeachment proceedings."
Trump's attempt to get Mueller fired was wrong and might have been unlawful -- but there is some legitimate debate there -- this alleged attempt to prosecute a political opponent and witness in an obstruction probe would be blatantly unconstitutional.
Trump attempting to order the prosecution of Clinton and Comey is the most significant legal scandal to hit the White House since the report that Trump tried to get Mueller fired.

Sessions replacement is a former prosecutor and former GOP candidate who recently outlined *how to limit and defund the Mueller probe* https://t.co/m3Edww59FX
Tonight we won't ask any of our experts if they're "surprised" by Sessions' firing - a vapid metric - but whether this is an effort to undercut the rule of law, and if it may be an element of obstruction of justice, and if there are relevant limits on the powers of an acting AG.
FACT: A President under investigation for *firing the FBI Director* &amp; obstructing justice who recently watched guilty pleas &amp; flipping by his personal lawyer, campaign chair, deputy chair &amp; national security adviser just fired his handpicked AG &amp; replaced him with a loyalist.
OPEN QUESTIONS on Trump firing Jeff Sessions:		Did Trump link firing to DOJ investigating Trump (as he did in his letter firing Comey)?		Did he seek loyalty or assurances about the open probe from Sessions' replacement?		When did Trump ask for this resignation letter?

Kavanaugh cites "revenge on behalf of the Clintons" and the 2016 election as animating opposition to him -- easily the most direct partisan language a SCOTUS nominee has used in a confirmation hearing in the modern era.
Kavanaugh delivering his opening not only as a defense of his nomination, but an attack on the Senate's judicial confirmation process - and he alleges the timing of the Ford allegation was a carefully plotted Democratic smear to take him out when the first hearings wouldn't.
Sen. Coons pushing a basic, relevant point: 		The timeline suggests her effort was to initially warn against picking Kavanaugh in advance of his nomination, not to impugn him ‚Äúbecause‚Äù he was picked for the Court.

Right tariff wars are literally recent and ancient history, as a policy matter. As a journalistic story, the book would be about half as long without sources close to Gary Cohn and sources familiar with Gary Cohn‚Äôs thinking. https://t.co/z1VPZTH0rd
And the depiction of the trade debate is odd ‚Äî presents Trump‚Äôs approach as unique and dangerous, but even if his trade policies fail, they fit into a long history of trade controversies that run the ideological gambit (Perot, Sanders, etc)
There‚Äôs no wider analysis ‚Äî which may be Woodward‚Äôs version of ‚ÄúJust the facts/quotes‚Äù ‚Äî so it‚Äôs not a big take or history of the start of this presidency.
Overall, this isn‚Äôt a broad book about the Trump presidency. It‚Äôs about internal strife about 3 main issues - trade, foreign policy and the Mueller probe - with a heavy dose of the perspective from critics in those areas (especially Cohn).
There‚Äôs also an interesting defense of the Dowd-Cobb cooperation strategy, which is now one of the most controversial moves among Trump‚Äôs remaining legal advisors.
Woodward also reports Trump didn‚Äôt understand he did NOT have attorney client privilege with Cobb, as a WH lawyer. And Trump later bemoaned how much he told him. Yikes.
Obviously it serves the President poorly to have attorney client counsel leak in a criminal probe. 		Several parts of the book are heavy with things Dowd saw or thought.
Dowd calls Trump on AF1 - who is leaking this privileged call? It would seem to be a call between client, lawyer and *maybe* a trusted Trump confidante on AF1.
Some of the most remarkable leaks are the ones breaking attorney-client privilege between Dowd and POTUS.

Wow Kavanaugh whiffing on Feinstein‚Äôs basic question re Nixon case and whether a President can face a criminal investigation. Ducks as ‚Äúhypothetical‚Äù but there are ways to answer that without prejudging future cases

A special guest on The Beat tonight: @MichaelEDyson https://t.co/M8Mc7XawOf
Judge Kavanaugh uses his opening statement to praise Dem-appointed judges like Kagan and Garland, to tout his diverse pool of law clerks, and to argue he believes in civil rights and gender equality.
It can be hard to follow agency law debates in the abstract. 		In concrete terms, Kavanaugh‚Äôs concern about the power of federal agencies has meant skepticism towards federal efforts to regulate Wall St after the financial crisis and efforts to protect the environment.
If confirmed, btw, Kavanaugh would be the 9th Justice on the court who went to Yale or Harvard.
If confirmed, Kavanaugh would be the *fourth* DC circuit judge on SCOTUS. (Garland was also DC circuit)
Kavanaugh and Gorsuch both show great concern about the administrative state, and their DC Circuit experience puts them in touch with these issues more than all other appeals judges around the country.
This is a more straightforward version of what conservative legal activists say about the administrative state, Chevron jurisprudence, etc.
Sen Sasse‚Äôs statement is very in sync with Kavanaugh‚Äôs longstanding judicial concern ‚Äî Congress hands off too many decisions to federal agencies, which abdicates accountability and leaves too much power with bureaucrats.

Grassley now complains about this process, says he‚Äôs never seen this in his 15 SCOTUS confirmation hearings - Dems are arguing that would be because his party wouldn‚Äôt even *hold a hearing* on Garland
Note that WH strategy was to have *Kavanaugh* raise Merrick Garland‚Äôs name first, but Dems have now done it by seizing time before his opening remarks.
Grassley speaking beyond the room, telling Americans who are watching that he‚Äôs being ‚Äúpatient‚Äù (in his view) because there will be hearings for days.
Sen Cornyn jumps in to defend Grassley - first time another Republican Senator has engaged Dems on their terms - and argue Dems would be ‚Äúheld in contempt‚Äù for their comments if this were court. (But it‚Äôs not court, it‚Äôs a Senate heading.)
Unusual start: https://t.co/xv19CzrO9L
Dems on the committee  are using ‚ÄúSenate euphemisms‚Äù to basically call Sen. Grassley a huge hypocrite before letting Kavanaugh speak.
Grassley began by trying to silence Dems under committee rules (regular order), but relented to address the transparency fight, and now has pivoted back to his remarks and introducing Kavanaugh.
Procedurally, Dems have now effectively pushed Grassley to open hearing with a debate over the secrecy and transparency around Kavanaugh - not the usual opening statements from the committee and nominee.
Sen Grassley responds to Dem request to get more documents about Judge Kavanaugh by accusing Dems of ‚Äúobstructing‚Äù the nomination process.
Police just removed 3 protesters from the back of the hearing room, one carried by her feet and hands.

For example, Mueller‚Äôs plea deals included potential cooperation with other federal and even state authorities ‚Äî but of course a defendant can *also* reach a deal without being a cooperating witness.

What would happen to the Manafort case in the event of a partial verdict? 		Legally, he would still face any VA charges that this jury deadlocked on, plus the DC charges ‚Äî so potentially two more federal trials.
Legally, a judge can push a jury to keep seeking consensus on a deadlocked count, or can clear the way for a partial verdict on the counts where there is consensus.
Manafort jury note suggests they are only deadlocked on one count, so they would have consensus on the other 17.
This reporting puts a big number on the *size* of Cohen‚Äôs potential financial crimes - $20 million - and reiterates a legal point concerning for Trump:		Cutting a plea deal with the Feds in NY is also likely to include Cohen cooperating with Mueller in DC. https://t.co/OJP8UdEqPC

Our top story tonight ‚Äî the humanitarian crisis unfolding from the Trump administration‚Äôs policy splitting up immigrant families
Even an overwritten Tom Wolfe version of this saga wouldn't reach for this flagrantly hypocritical comeuppance:		Comey now busted for USING PERSONAL EMAIL FOR FBI BUSINESS WHILE IMPUGNING CLINTON FOR THE SAME THING		IG: Comey "frequently" used "personal email" for "FBI business."
More roasting of Comey:		Horowitz finds it "extraordinary" Comey wouldn't even talk to his boss (DAG) or Lynch about navigating "the most important decision" he faced and "mitigating the harms."		IG's implication is that arrogance hurt Comey, FBI and the nation.
IG report also gives unusual internal details on longstanding issue with FBI-DOJ relations - FBI chiefs don't really think DAG is their boss and act accordingly.		Shows DAG Yates thought telling Comey not to send email letter would get "hard push back"		cc @matthewamiller
IG report also rejects Comey's famous claim that trying to follow longstanding policy put him in a dilemma between speaking or "concealing."		That's a "false dichotomy," Horowitz writes, which is DOJ IG speak for a #roasting https://t.co/OrjX2Zp3s5
Not the one that @yogottikom is addicted to https://t.co/A6JPC4fX7w
A matter of debate, of course, but IG does note several FBI officials *said* Comey sent the letter to Congress partly BECAUSE he worried it would leak anyway --		i.e. rewarding potentially illegal leakers and concerns about protecting himself/FBI, not a sound legal reason.
Among other unpredictable and perhaps absurd ironies, of course, it was the *delay* in the search that HURT Clinton -- had they started earlier and found the emails didn't change anything earlier it would have mattered less. #Horowitz https://t.co/EAogp7ODGR
IG: We searched for evidence that the Weiner email search was delayed to "protect Clinton" and found "no evidence" of that after searching "emails, texts, IMs" and documents.
Full disclosure: Obv it's problematic that I can quote Comey's family's criticism of his presser from his book, #toomuchtimeon1story https://t.co/NAFai58JSU
IG is clear on Comey, finding:		- he "concealed" secret plan to do the Seacresting presser re Clinton (as he admits in his book) &amp;	- he was "insubordinate" to do so		(#Seacresting is a ref to how Comey's family said he was wrong to do the presser with reality show style mystery)
IG has odd take on Lynch: She didn't discuss anything wrong with Bill Clinton &amp; maybe it was okay to meet him, but was an "error" not to "cut the visit short"		So short meeting that doesn't discuss probe is OK -- but long meeting that doesn't discuss probe is an error?		#Horowitz
So many parts of what the IG is probing relate to contact with the *media* - including Lynch's (totally confusing but not legally inappropriate) answer to a reporter question that she expected to accept the recommendation of career prosecutors and agents.
IG finds Comey warned DOJ he would push for a Clinton special counsel appointment if things went past the conventions because he didn't think DOJ could "credibly announce the closing" of the probe once Clinton was technically nominated at the convention.		Oh Comey.
Going to post about the DOJ Comey Clinton IG report... we will also have full coverage tonight at 6pm

Tonight‚Äôs filing is prosecutorial hardball ‚Äî Andrew Weissman is the signature after Mueller on the filing; he is the prosecutor that Trump allies have pinpointed as most intimidating to the White House.
Bottom line: Tonight Mueller is alleging Manafort has committed a *new federal crime* trying to tamper with this case and should be jailed while he awaits trial.		Pretrial imprisonment would, of course, put tremendous new pressure on a defendant to cooperate.

So Cohen‚Äôs legal exposure now turns on:		Did he lie to banks about this (Bank Fraud Act)		Did he lie to New York State about this (can‚Äôt be pardoned by a POTUS)		Did he conspire to promise gov actions for money (bribery)		Did he conspire to collude?
Watergate was about following the money.		This is about following the debt.
Never thought I‚Äôd say this, but...		Is it possible Cohen created more risk to Trump‚Äôs presidency as an outsider than had he been allowed to work in the Trump administration?

Rachel @Maddow just cut to the heart and logically nailed Comey's core error on AG Lynch:		You worried more about what *misinformed* people might think about Lynch than just doing the job right.		(paraphrase)
Comey won't answer if he briefed Lynch - whom he says he doesn't think acted improperly - but he worried FALSE info about Lynch could lead people to attack her *if* it came out. (It didn't)		This sounds even more absurd in this intv than the way he describes it in the book	Unreal
@matthewfederman well if you admire someone / you should go ahead and tell em / people never get the flowers / when they can still smell em 	@kanyewest @THEKIDMERO
Comey mems: Three separate memos recount three different times Trump returned to his concern about whether McCabe was out to get Trump.
Comey to @maddow: We did start investigating whether Giuliani really knew in advance and if there were FBI leaks for politics, I was fired before learning the result.		We have separate reporting that there was a heightened effort re those internal leaks
Comey memo: Trump asked him about Nunes &amp; Grassley's strategies re FBI, including holding up Dep A.G. nominee (Rosenstein) to get information from DOJ/FBI.		Portrait of Trump's detail oriented, multi-pronged strategy to press DOJ/FBI, potential coordination with GOP members
Comey memo says Trump told him he would bring a personal lawsuit against Steele over dossier.
Comey memo says Trump once noted Comey got more publicity than Trump, and Comey said "I hate it."
Comey memo notes Trump's keen understanding that even brief stints in jail can make people cooperate -- he wanted to jail reporters because even a "couple days" of jail could make them "ready to talk" about their sources to help with leak prosecutions.
Comey memo: Trump asked Comey if he watched the WH press briefing one day, (FBI directors typically work and aren't watching a staffer press conference), and if "you saw my Tweet this morning"...
Fascinating @maddow interview so far
Comey: McCabe had authority to authorize disclosures to the media, he didn't tell me about it beforehand, IG report is right about that -- but he may think he had the authority, as a matter of rule he had that authority.
New: Comey says Trump ran orchestrated campaign to tear down McCabe, adds it is "shameful"		on @maddow
Comey memo: Trump brought up the "Russians wanting an apology from Bill O'Reilly" for his Putin question.
Comey memo: At another meet and greet, Trump brought up McCabe again, asking if he had a problem with Trump, and if he he ever cited Trump's attacks on his wife. Portrait of a fixation.
And wow, Comey memo says Reince "pressed" him on why Clinton email case didn't meet "chargeable" standard (the bar for charging her with a crime).
Comey memo: 		Reince once told Comey that Clinton campaign mishandled his final Oct letter, because they could have gotten an electoral boost by pushing it "harder as good news."		@RobbyMook @brianefallon @Reince @PhilippeReines @neeratanden
Comey to @maddow: I think Reince was getting at whether there was ongoing surveillance of Flynn... I gave him the answer (but said better to go through DOJ channels)
Trump told Comey Flynn has "serious judgment issues" at the dinner, was concerned about his response time in an incident with UK diplomacy.		Note the picture of Trump as a man far more canny and detail oriented in private than the role he plays in public.
Comey memo:		Trump to Comey at dinner: Reince doesn't know we're having dinner.
Comey memo: After requesting loyalty pledge, Trump returned *again* to ask about "your guy McCabe" and was he OK?		Portrait of Trump fixated on the loyalty of every top law enforcement figure, as if they are not there to protect the nation but rather pose a threat to him.
Comey memo: He says he told Trump that Eric Holder was "smarter and more sophisticated and smoother" than Loretta Lynch.		Comey is quite harsh on Lynch in the book.
Comey memo: Trump used dinner to ask if "your guy McCabe" had a problem with Trump.		So POTUS had laser focus on FBI officials by name, even outside of his authority to fire.		Today we learn DOJ considering indicting McCabe.
Fascinating (seems new) in Comey memo:		On the Clinton email case, Trump knew "sequence of events extremely well," referred to Comey 1, Comey 2 and Comey 3 re his actions on Clinton case during the campaign, and pushed on whether FBI had a "revolt" after Comey 1 (clearing her).
"There were almost no periods of silence during the hour and 20 minutes" of dinner with Trump, who spoke the "overwhelming majority of the time."	-Comey memo
Newly leaked Comey memo on Trump dinner: 		Conversation was chaotic, topics were raised and returned to later, making it "very difficult to recount in a linear fashion."
Newly leaked Comey memo on Trump Tower states:		Trump said he assumes hotels he stays in are wired, Comey said he thought so "as well."
Comey: These writings about Trump were not a traditional 302 (agent notes on an intv), but were my effort to capture what I saw, this one is an email to my team..		@maddow

The potential misuse of a criminal investigation to target or jail critics would be an even more serious assault on the rule of law than firing a special prosecutor.

6ix9‚Äôs new music video just dropped, but there‚Äôs also the Beychella video to get through, we all have to make choices in life.
RT @matthewamiller: @AriMelber some of us had the same position throughout and were quite vocal about it.
Effective strategists do know how to *pick* their own opponents ‚Äî and evade the tougher ones. Comey‚Äôs book only addresses ‚Äòpartisan‚Äô critics of his 2016 actions, and ducks all the nonpartisan legal experts and former prosecutors.		Quite a choice for a lifelong prosecutor.
Comey quotes a tweet saying he was ‚Äòa hack, ‚Äò but it‚Äôs unclear for which party. 		Sometimes, when both sides criticize you it‚Äôs a sign of independence. But it can also be a sign you got something really, broadly wrong.
Comey suggests what we all need to do now is go back in time with him, and look at what happened from his perspective: https://t.co/noSsRMT9g1
Not much reflection in these passages honestly https://t.co/S67F2TbrV0
Comey‚Äôs own account does show why he was totally wrong - credit for candor there - within *days,* they learned most of the emails were duplicates (the FBI had already reviewed them), and they changed nothing. 		So had he waited a few days, he could have announced that or nothing. https://t.co/ciSM64l9RL
Comey casts himself as the one independent person in a sea of partisan hacks, while he released letter for the good of the nation, ‚Äúmost‚Äù of his critics would ‚Äúdo what was best for their favorite team.‚Äù		Does that include all the former DOJ officials who critiqued him?
Then James @Comey blasts the critics of his October letter as driven ‚Äúaround the bend‚Äù and moved to ‚Äúhysteria.‚Äù 		He insists he didn‚Äôt violate DOJ policy (many legal experts say he did, though as a unique situation it‚Äôs somewhat debatable).
The Comey leans on a self-pitying partisan frame, saying his ‚Äúhaters from July.. switched positions‚Äù after his letter. Doesn‚Äôt really reckon with the fact that the letter was ‚Äúmisunderstood‚Äù in the ‚Äúmiddle of an election‚Äù exactly as he seemed aware it could be. https://t.co/OSU9AwKThZ
Comey says he told DOJ he planned to make the unusual announcement about the emails before finding out what was in them, was advised against it but not ordered against it, and thus he concluded, ‚Äúonce again it became *my* responsibility to take the hit.‚Äù https://t.co/92XCSEA0fL
Law enforcement gets leads all the time that must be pursued, but go nowhere. He made a mistake in promoting a lead, without facts, in the heat of an election. People do make mistakes. But doubling down on it now, after everything, with the benefit of hindsight? #AHigherLoyalty
But that is backwards. If there was nothing legally important on the laptop - which the FBI later concluded - there is noting catastrophic about using the normal process to find the facts.
Comey makes the rather histrionic rationalization that ‚Äúno matter what‚Äù was found on Weiner‚Äôs laptop ‚Äî if the FBI did not do PR and announce the search *before* learning the facts, it would be ‚Äúcatastrophic to the integrity of the FBI and DOJ.‚Äù 	p. 196

Me live tweeting the Comey book on a Sunday and normal Twitter like https://t.co/1Yp07TQwqS
He goes on to defend his Clinton press conference ‚Äúin hindsight‚Äù by saying Ds and Rs had their predictable political response to it. But what about the widespread criticism from nonpartisan legal experts? He doesn‚Äôt address that in this chapter.
If true, of course that would be wrong; if false, then it would just be another lie. Worrying about the optics falls into the very trap partisans set for the FBI. (p. 178)
He writes he worried that a potential attack on AG Lynch, which might have been a lie, ‚Äúwould allow partisans to argue, powerfully, that the Clinton Campaign, through Lynch, had been controlling the FBI‚Äôs investigation.‚Äù
James Comey writes that partisans will misconstrue what the FBI does no matter what, but then he says he made decisions out of concern about what partisans would say about the FBI. This book is damning in ways he may not even realize.
‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a certain freedom in being totally screwed... you‚Äôll be attacked no matter what you do. Half the country will howl either way.. it never occurred to me that our decisions could outrage both halves.‚Äù		- @Comey (new book)

Why the Cambridge-Trump-Facebook link matters, and where we go from here -- this thread draws on my longer conversation with attorney @jaywillis that I hope you will consider reading and sharing!...		https://t.co/iMUznjr9mt 		@GQMagazine
And today, people are more concerned about someone rifling through their *phone* than going through their bedroom drawers. So what does the Bill of Rights mean online?		We need this debate - with accountability, with CEOs under oath in Congress - and a bit less techsplaining.
But when these companies fight any and all regulation so much, that they suppress any public-private partnership to address these problems, the backlash you earn can be so great that you actually become a handmaiden to your own "over-regulation."	FB might be headed for that.
Tech companies have a point saying that a rush to enact  broad regulation, in response to a particular problem of the moment, can cause more problems than it solves.
Now, the drawback to regulation is potential interference with vital innovation. In history, many smart people in Congress (or agencies) were unable to foresee what might be valuable to society, and who made poor regulatory decisions as a result.
And FB touts their technical acumen for every possible part of the site, except when it comes to resolving problems like these. When they want to fix something, they're pretty good at  doing so. When they don‚Äôt, the lectures come about how impossible it is to do things.
..and of how long it takes Congress to study issues, create agencies, and write laws. Right now, it‚Äôs just a patchwork of some media regulation, some Federal Trade  Commission regulation, and whatever Congress does or doesn‚Äôt do to  update existing election laws.
Tech companies are so new that‚Äî by virtue of their  youth‚Äîthey have never been regulated like older industries. That isn't the product of any considered  judgment that they don't merit regulation. It's an accidental result of how new they are..
Then there is #Regulation - Zuckerberg now claims he's open to it maybe; but his company paid lobbyists to oppose proposed election disclosure rules for Facebook. The new talk isn't "just talk" - it's misleading based on FB's actual lobbying record.
And thanks to a whistleblower, we are learning Cambridge touted its web manipulation, ‚Äúinformation dominance,‚Äù and alternative facts‚Äîwhich overlaps with a key tenet of the Trump campaign.
This is the digital firm Trump chose, run by Bannon and the Mercers, who specifically asked if Cambridge could help boost the impact of stolen material released by Wikileaks... that is a *window* into a mindset, even if no technical law was broken.
Now @jaywillis asks, Did Cambridge break the law?.. and we don't know. 		They caught a search warrant in London today, and Mueller is interested, but the answer could def ultimately be no.		But we do know...
Any company will pursue profits. But FB has an inherent conflict: They claim to  treat users as customers, or "community," but as many tech experts have shown, the customers are *actually the product.*		Users come not second for  Facebook, but something like fourth or fifth.
..Focusing on the minutiae of rules can come at the expense of looking at the moral and societal questions. 		Facebook lost $50B because people are learning about this company's core conflict between its business model and the personal rights of its user base.
With stories like this, people tend to first look at what *rules* have been broken... like FB's app rules that developers agree to, or other laws and regulations that are implicated. BUT...
The Cambridge-Facebook story is important .. not just because of Russia or Trump or Zuckerberg or John Bolton (who used Cambridge) or Bannon or Peter Thiel or the tremendous number of intersections of important people in this story.

@joshtpm Gotcha! :)
Now, none of that *resolves* the legal question. Mueller is gathering evidence on conspiracy, hacking and obstruction, and the judicial process has the final ruling on whether obstruction of justice occurred.
The Times article - which is well reported - meekly notes these ‚Äúleaks do not fit neatly into a Deep State adversary view.‚Äù		Another way to put it: 		Trump is systematically undermining his AG, Comey, Comey‚Äôs deputy and Mueller‚Äôs boss ‚Äî while under investigation for obstruction.
The claims are thin and hard to follow, but it‚Äôs designed to sow doubt and create a smokescreen around the key people who were in the room with Comey and could someday be Mueller‚Äôs key witnesses.
So the whole thing is a loop of political attacks and pressure on the FBI, and even when the FBI reportedly took the more assertive stance on Clinton, THAT is used against McCabe.
So there was GOP political pressure to do more investigation of Clinton, and some at the FBI apparently wanted to do more, and DOJ disagreed, and now the FBI talking to the press about *that* is what some Republicans may use against McCabe.
It stems back to GOP pressure to launch a *separate* probe into Clinton over the Clinton Foundation. McCabe apparently talked to the Wall St Journal in response.
Trump has been blasting McCabe, a career FBI official and Republican, and now we are seeing new clues about what the internal FBI review is about...

Note Mueller is getting Gates to plead guilty to lying to the FBI *JUST THREE WEEKS AGO* on February 1st, 2018.		What were they talking about that day? Was it the 'Queen for a Day' proffer session?		Either way, Mueller shows again he will go to the mat if anyone lies to the FBI.
