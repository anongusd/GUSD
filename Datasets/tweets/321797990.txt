Rep. @LacyClayMO1 says he's not anti-police; painting is a result of "animalistic behavior" from certain cops that killed unarmed black men https://t.co/8KedpVtRrJ
5. When asked why he took it upon himself to remove the student painting "it had to be done, so I just did it," said @Rep_Hunter
4. Rep Hunter "It's not about the 1st Amendment, it's about the Capitol rules and the art competition rules" that don't allow offensive art.
3)Rep Hunter says "it's false analysis" to compare (offensive) art work that was created 50-100 years ago to modern day (offensive) painting
2)Rep.Hunter says "that's ridiculous, no comparison" to what CBC says is offensive on the Hill:portraits of slave owners/confederate statues https://t.co/zQ73dbDvPd
