I think we can all agree the news media have failed the Covington Catholic story on multiple counts, the most egregious among them is not putting the "Curb Your Enthusiasm" music over that kid's face.

Again, the Founders expected a crazy or corrupt president eventually. They didn't account for the corruption of an entire political party protecting him.		When @OrrinHatch openly admits to turning a blind eye, we got problems. https://t.co/uCwXrAKZVK
@RudyGiuliani https://t.co/Uz7Hrlvfy2
@Jim_Jordan Hey, this is exactly what I was talking about this morning. Cool!		The Founders always assumed we could have a @realDonaldTrump on our hands. That's why there's a non-guillotine system in place for dumping him.		They never anticipated @Jim_Jordan-style corruption.
What no one bargained on was the majority of the body in charge of enforcing that mechanism also being corrupt.		THAT'S the fundamental threat to democracy, not @realDonaldTrump.
We should probably shift the narrative away from @realDonaldTrump's corruption to @senatemajldr. We've always known that we'd have a corrupt or insane president. That's why the impeachment system was written.		https://t.co/JljImeaocm

I'm all for healthy public debate, but the second tweet in the thread contradicts this premise. Plus, the "we need healthy debate" trope is usually a Trojan horse for introducing topics like "Are black people really people?" and "Aren't some women just asking for it?" https://t.co/t7XkdoHE1I
@realDonaldTrump Absent a subject, I can't tell if this is an accusation or an admission.		#GrammarMatters
@GovMikeHuckabee Actually this is more believable than you identifying as a decent person.		So, you know, there's that.

Big doin's in election land. McCaskill won her primary. It looks like Republicans will eek out a victory in Ohio. Kris Kobach is leading... barely, in the R race for governor. Big MO rejected a right-to-work law.		Bottom line, we're still very much divided.

@nedryun @KurtSchlichter Okay, but there have only been two GOP victories since then and 2004 was seen as mostly legitimate (Ken Blackwell shenanigans notwithstanding).		50% of the elections Republicans have won doesn't really make the case for the intransigent left.

@thehill That said, if we start attaching dog features to people, it's probably time society had a sit-down.
@thehill In a society that heavily rewards you for physical attractiveness, this is hardly irrational. People might as well complain that these (mostly women) wish they had more money. Beauty is currency.

@Yadda66 @middletyn @benhopkinsmusic @sullydish No one knows if that is true. That's just something Republicans say to make them feel better about their current state. It would have made sense in 1964, though.		Also, the relevance of one man being a Republican 54 years ago is irrelevant to your point about Democrats. https://t.co/jHMhDLkF9K
@Yadda66 @middletyn @benhopkinsmusic @sullydish It's now known as the Civil Rights Act of 1964.
@Yadda66 @middletyn @benhopkinsmusic @sullydish Congressman Emanuel Celler (D-NY) introduced H.R. 7152. Senate Majority Leader Mike Mansfield (D-MT) fast-tracked the same bill in the Senate. Majority Whip Hubert Humphrey (D-MN) whipped a 67-vote filibuster-proof majority. Democratic President Lyndon Johnson signed it.
@middletyn @benhopkinsmusic @sullydish I *was* going to vote Democrat, but someone described their experience as a minority in a way that made me feel bad. Therefore, I have decided to change my position on abortion, climate change, education, military spending, taxes, crime...
