@DavidLarter I hear what you're saying, but keep in mind that it's a long season.
@DavidLarter I like the Phillies plan of trying to get more skilled players in their lineup but I worry that other teams may also try to duplicate that.
@wardcarroll @DavidLarter It’s a complex sport. Sometimes it takes a keen eye to see through the strategery.
@tmorrisnova @VFWHQ Thank you! I’ll do my best to keep it up.
@TimothyJLawson Wonderful! Congrats on the new spot, help keep us up to date on the important work over there.
@DavidLarter I think the Phillies have a great chance this year if they can score more runs than their opponents. That should be their strategy heading into the season.
@TimothyJLawson Just to be clear ... you’re working at Arlington and not moving into a plot there ...

@CDicksteinDC @HarrisonCramer @AaronMehta @navybook This is my actual fear. You want the DH, fine, whatever. But don’t pretend it helps with the time. Put a 30 second clock on pitches and no step outs for batters, then have the DH debate afterwards.
@AaronMehta @CDicksteinDC @navybook Counterpoint: it’s your lousy league’s tradition.
@AaronMehta @CDicksteinDC @navybook So one more hit every five games by replacing pitchers with Davis. Weee. Totally worth dumping tradition.
@AaronMehta @CDicksteinDC @navybook I also did actual reporting in that time. https://t.co/C0806ZPBEe

@mccanner @kdbrecht https://t.co/Tq2ANm3L7L
@navybook @CDicksteinDC @AaronMehta Nevermind, Aaron won me over. Who wants to see pitchers hit in the 9 spot when you could watch pros like Chris Davis extend their careers by years? Plus it will make the games faster because magic.
Trump tells coalition forces that ISIS fighters (estimated up to 30K left) won't be totally eliminated. "You’re always going to have some people. They’re around, they’re sick, they’re demented. But you can’t do better than we have militarily."
Trump, in his D-ISIS Ministerial address, said he expects coalition forces to claim 100 percent of ISIS territory by next week. "They're gone."
@Kyle_Feldscher @AaronMehta @navybook Bad news, Kyle. Someone has hacked it to agree with Aaron, which you know in your heart is wrong.
@AaronMehta @navybook Well you're obviously just wrong on that so I wanted to present something constructive.
@AaronMehta @navybook Not the problem. https://t.co/2LQTsLEdjJ

My Twitter feed is flooded with Va. news instead of the normal VA news.
RT @TaraCopp: Catch @LeoShane and I on @GovMattersTV tonight as we break down the #SOTU and generally try not to trip each other up on air
@philbriggsVet :) White House made those bios available. Typically it’s done in advance, but for those four it was done mid speech.
@SGillums I should have been more specific with that tweet. Both only said the word “veterans” once. Trump talked about the WWII guys at the beginning and end. But, point was that it wasn’t a significant topic of policy discussion in either speech.
RT @Oriana0214: Acting SecDef (@DepSecDef) releases this following #SOTU:		“In his State of Union address tonight, President Trump reaffirm…
FYI, @SecWilkie was in the room tonight. https://t.co/vOK7CTCpr3
@jchenelly @SecWilkie Ah, makes sense. I kept missing him in the crowd shots.
FWIW, Trump and Abrams each mentioned "veterans" just once in their speeches. For Trump it was a sentence about VA policy successes, Abrams referred to "the values our brave men and women in uniform and our veterans risk their lives to defend." #SOTU
Worth noting that @SecWilkie mentions the VA Accountability act but does not claim that it has taken 40 years to pass Congress, as the president did. https://t.co/NBnwG4zSD2
.@SecWilkie statement on Trump #SOTU includes a lot more veterans issues than the president mentioned in his one sentence on VA policies. https://t.co/Un5F8V3LDv
Trump defends overseas troop drawdowns, border mission increases in #SOTU-- full story from me and @reporterjoe https://t.co/7T0Z8JWBNJ
@mabryant256 @POTUS Don't hold your breath.
From earlier today: Up to 30K ISIS fighters may still be operating in the Middle East, DOD officials say (by @reporterjoe) https://t.co/UhrFydTN7q https://t.co/KgFbgntx2g
More Trump on Afghanistan: "We do not know whether we will achieve an agreement. But we do know that after two decades of war, the hour has come to at least try for peace. And the other side wants that too." #SOTU
Trump: "I have also accelerated our negotiations to reach a political settlement in Afghanistan.  Our troops have fought with unmatched valor. And thanks to their bravery, we are now able to pursue a political solution to this long and bloody conflict." #SOTU
Trump, offering a more optimistic view of the Middle East situation than military officials: "When I took office, ISIS controlled more than 20K square miles in Iraq &amp; Syria. Today, we have liberated virtually all that territory from the grip of these bloodthirsty killers." #SOTU
Trump claims he averted world war with North Korea in #SOTU: "If I had not been elected President of the United States, we would right now, in my opinion, be in a major war with North Korea."
Trump again takes aim at NATO: 	"For years, the United States was being treated very unfairly by friends of ours, NATO. But now we have secured a $100 billion increase in defense spending from NATO allies. They said it couldn't be done!" #SOTU
Trump: "Over the last two years, we have begun to fully rebuild the United States military, with $700 billion last year and $716 billion this year.  We are also getting other nations to pay their fair share, finally." #SOTU
@mabryant256 I'd have some tough questions for those sources then.
@RileyTopping @thehill In fairness, it's not like we just had major community care standards drop that he has talked about for months...
Trump: "As we speak, large, organized caravans are on the march to the United States ... I have ordered another 3,750 troops to our southern border to prepare for the tremendous onslaught." #SOTU
Here's more background on the three WWII vets and one concentration camp survivor honored by the president in tonight's #SOTU address: https://t.co/wRvJjXs3nX
@83littlemj @USCG You can turn in.
@NiseeMcD I'm not sure whether to smile or cry...
Also that one sentence concludes the veterans policy portion of tonight's #SOTU19 address. Don't stay up waiting for more VA talk, because it does not appear to be coming.
One more reminder that the VA Accountability bill had been pending in Congress for about two years, not 40. There is no basis for Trump claiming that measure took 40 years to pass. #SOTU
Trump: "Last Congress, both parties came together to pass unprecedented legislation (including) historic VA reforms, and after four decades of rejection, we passed VA Accountability so we can finally terminate those who mistreat our wonderful veterans." #SOTU
Trump: "If there is going to be peace and legislation, there cannot be war and investigation.  It just doesn't work that way.  We must be united at home to defeat our adversaries abroad." #SOTU
Trump #SOTU19: “The State of our Union is strong.” MUST CREDIT
Trump's #SOTU19: "After 24 months of rapid progress, our economy is the envy of the world, our military is the most powerful on earth by far [big ovation there] and America is winning each and every day."
So, I hope all my VA policy followers enjoyed that shout out to WWII veterans because ... #SOTU
WWII vets get a big ovation, as they should. #SOTU
I saw acting SecDef Shanahan among the Cabinet members entering the chamber but did not spot @SecWilkie. Anyone in the chamber right now see him? #SOTU

Hearing from VA now that the new standards will triple or quadruple the number of vets eligible for community care. But VA is projecting that the total number of outside appointments won’t increase dramatically, because vets like their existing care. https://t.co/OOuzGq1Unw
A possible point of contention with the new VA outside care access standards: How they come up with the “30-minute drive” calculation. Right now, VA is planning to use a proprietary program with Bing. Lots of questions.
I've heard recently from lawmakers/veterans advocates concerned that VA hasn't involved them enough in drafting the new community care standards. They responded today by releasing the standards online before briefing congressional offices and those veterans groups. Interesting.
Read up on this now, because these standards will be ground zero for the "privatization" debate over veterans health care in coming months https://t.co/SKp9RciaJn

@ed_alca @MaureenElias2 Very tough to get that message out further when lots of folks think they “know” different.
.@MaureenElias2 says one of the most problematic myths around suicide is that “if someone wants to kill themselves, you can’t stop them.” There’s an abundance of research showing that intervention can prevent tragedy. Vets and general public both need to know that.
Since we’re talking vets suicide again today, remember: To contact the Veteran Crisis Line, call 1-800-273-8255 and select option 1 for a VA staffer. Veterans, troops or their families members can also text 838255 or visit https://t.co/VYLrblex72 for assistance.

@D_Opus Officially, no. Unofficially, that’s the worry. Good commanders won’t hold that against their troops. Bad ones might.
@Empowlr I know the stats are on official DOD sites, but I’m balancing paper copies at the moment ...
So far, 27 cities and 7 states have signed on, Franklin says. Seen as a potential benefit to both vets and the broader community. Each day 123 Americans commit suicide (20 of them are vets).
Dr. Kieta Franklin, director of VA’s suicide prevention office, says the department is rolling out a “mayors’ challenge” on vets suicide prevention. Means more training, outreach for civic leaders. Used to success in vets homelessness in the past.
@stacieskelley Small print — 2018 is only partial year numbers.
More DOD suicide stats: 9% of male servicemembers have thought about taking their own life. But more than 40% of troops say they would not seek help out of fear that it would label them as “broken.” 		Stigma remains a major problem.
@HeatherKellyPhD I see you didn’t save me a seat.

Trump at #AFBF19 invokes veterans: "We got veterans choice approved, which was amazing. They've been trying to get that for years &amp; years, decades &amp; decades." VA Choice was approved in 2014. Trump signed the VA Mission act last summer, mandates overhaul of community care programs

@MiekeEoyang @andclev Not sure why you see the story as condemning. But, for what it’s worth, 13 percent of Dept of Ag employees are veterans. They seem to be able to handle other topics too.
.@SenSchumer: "800K federal workers will miss a paycheck, TSA agents &amp; border patrol, air traffic controllers, food inspectors, Veterans Affairs staffers, FEMA aides and many more."	 	VA is actually fine -- their budget was approved back in the fall. No lost paychecks there.
Trump just now: “We’ll either have a compromise or I’ll declare a national emergency” which would allow the White House to use military funds to build the border wall.

More from Trump: “You take a look at social media, so many of those (furloughed workers) are saying it’s very hard for me, it’s very hard for my family but Mr.	President you’re doing the right thing.”
Per WH pool report: Trump asked again about furloughed gov workers today. “These are	terrific patriots. A lot of them agree with what I’m doing ... They’re all going to get their money and I think they’re going to be happy.”

This is significant because it potentially gives VA more freedom to send vets outside the system and still claim to be the central decider of care. Will be an interesting angle in the privatization fight.

Veterans and the military get a passing shout out from Trump at the end of this presser, but were pretty much his same talking points on those topics from the campaign trail. No direct questions on the topics.
Trump says against he has done more for vets than any other president. “Look at Choice alone.”		Again, Trump has made VA Choice synonymous with the VA mission act. Choice was created in 2014. Mission act is a major revamp of that program.

Trump promises a “war-like posture” if Democrats start prosecuting his administration.
If Democrats start issuing subpoenas, Trump says, “we’ll do the same thing, government comes to a halt, and I’ll blame them.”
Trump seems to be saying he’ll be more successful with divided Congress than if Republicans held onto the House, because Dems will more sincerely negotiate now. Hints the Senate can pass things with “100 percent Democratic support” and just a few Republicans.
RT @JonathanTamari: Another new one from the president: taking a victory lap against people in HIS OWN PARTY who lost.
Trump mocks Republicans who distanced themselves from him in the election and lost, including HASC/House Vets member @RepMikeCoffman. “Too bad, Mike.”

@stigmacher1 @KHShan The calculation Congress uses to determine the military pay raise factors that all in. For 2019, it's 2.6 percent. That's the biggest in 10 years, but not above the expected rise in private sector wage growth. https://t.co/XxKvQ4ejw1
@JennaNeen Fair question. Several times under Obama, the pay raise was below the rate of private sector wage growth. Trump can tout that he has made sure that the pay raise is equal to that (although not above). But that's not the same as "first in 10 years." https://t.co/nqqnvrPJIq
FYI, here's the pay raise listing going back to the start of the all-volunteer military. https://t.co/vHTNl7Dihe
Why does this matter? Because the Trump supporters are repeating this as a fact. Take this RNC op-ed from earlier in the month. "Our troops finally have pay raises." https://t.co/LGF5l5mPT4
I knew I'd only get a day or two off from this: Trump over the weekend again incorrectly said the new defense budget gives the military its first pay raise in a decade. Troops have seen a pay raise every year since the 1970s. https://t.co/rrixCk8Ize https://t.co/7THHRpTuQA

Bad on me, folks. Trump, while talking about the military pay raise, said “I haven’t had a pay raise in 11 years” and not “troops haven’t had a pay raise in 11 years.” I deleted the original tweet to avoid further confusion. Trump has mixed this up in the past, but not this time.

@ddale8 Not good enough. I expect a detailed report from you explaining every inaccuracy from Trump on my desk by 5 pm.
@ddale8 But why 40 years? If he's making up times, why not just pick 10 years, to cast blame on Obama? Is everyone yearning for a return to the 1970s?
"40 years" and "44 years" just seems to be Trump's go-to for "a while." I'm not finding any evidence these correspond to actual times and dates.
Other things that have been waiting for 40+ years, according to Trump's remarks since June: 		-- Nazi guard Jakiw Palij's deportation	-- Alaska ANWR oil drilling	-- A new Canadian trade agreement	-- Tax reform	-- North Korea peace agreement	-- The "Right to try" law
Since the start of June, Trump in public remarks has claimed nine times veterans have been waiting for the VA Choice program (approved in 2014) for more than 40 years. 		He's also claimed six other times that lawmakers were trying to pass new VA accountability rules for 40 years.
@steveharmonious I'm trying to figure it out. That number just seems random.
Ah, I see @PolitiFact already beat me to the VA Choice comments: https://t.co/z2gMNmg3C7
I don't know what the "44 years" reference is.
VA Choice program was passed in 2014. Community care programs to allow some outside care have been available for decades. What the VA Mission Act (signed into law in June) does is replace a handful of separate outside care programs with a new, TBD one. "VA Choice" will be gone.
Lost in Trump's other MS rally remarks last night, he mischaracterized the VA Mission Act again: "We also passed Veterans Choice. 44 years they tried to do it. Giving our vets the right to see a private doctor if they have to wait in line for weeks &amp; weeks &amp; weeks. 44 years!"

On the Hill this week -- While we wait for the House to vote on defense appropriations, here's what else to watch for: https://t.co/VLUgUJ3cD7
@sgaskell That was a different records mess ... :)
VA will spend more than $200 billion total in fiscal 2019 https://t.co/A4JKzeZNxy
FYI, in case you forgot to count, the banner behind Trump at today's bill signing had "Supporting our Veterans" written 37 times.
@wsquared58 @ddale8 That's part of the idea behind this latest effort. A lot of folks think if VA and DOD are sharing one record, that becomes the standard for all American health records. But there are a ton of competing private interests here.
@ChrisInCHI Sure, but they were using JLV during the Obama admin, so that isn't anything for his admin to claim credit for.
Common and frustrating thing with Trump's VA comments is that he often refers to big reforms he has started as things that are "fixed" already at VA. Choice program, health records, staff hirings. All big promises that are started, not finished.
Trump: "We’ve done a lot of work on VA health care records, and now you’re able to transfer back and forth from the military."		No. The admin is starting a 10-year project that is designed to allow that kid of record sharing. Big deal, but it isn't done yet.
Trump again says that because of his administration "now we have VA Choice." 		VA Choice program was signed into law in 2014. In this budget, it now becomes a permanent part of VA medical budget, although lots of admin work still to be determined.
.@SecWilkie introducing Trump: "He was the first candidate to put veterans as the centerpiece of his campaign and his presidency."

@TexasNomad1 Well, VA doesn't want it at all, so...		Supporters have argued that since the VA home loan program is voluntary, it's not the same as trimming from existing vet benefits. No real talk of getting the money from outside the VA sphere.
.@SenatorIsakson raises concerns that the payfor of the Blue Water Navy fix (about $250 on every $100K of VA home loans) won't be enough to cover the $1 billion cost for expanding benefits to 90K veterans.
VA's Blue Water Navy fix objections: 		-- sets a new standard (non-scientific) for awarding disability benefits	-- opens door for many other claims	-- places a burden on VA home loan users (payfor comes from there)	-- burdens VA claims filing process
VA Benefits UnderSec Lawrence, on Blue Water Navy fix: "We oppose this bill because the science is not there, and what we do is based on science."		BWN advocates have long lamented that the scientific burden to prove exposure to Agent Orange on their ships is near impossible.

@rockrichard @VFW Thanks, man. But it's not about me. Press can't do its job right if vets don't share their stories, and that only happens if there is trust. Not just for certain outlets, but for the industry.
They are an important voice in DC policy, and have many programs that help veterans navigate complicated VA benefits/programs. They're also key in educating and informing the press about vets challenges and successes. Impossible to do my job right without the VSOs. https://t.co/P8Xr1n85hE
@tweetsformeg All that is very true, and is something we have tracked. But, I think it's important to note that rhetoric has slowly shifted from "we're giving you the pay raise you deserve" (fine) to "we're giving you the first pay raise you've gotten in forever" (flat wrong).

Not a good look for @VFWHQ. #VFWConvention https://t.co/nnHmsneDR7
Trump now using his #VFWConvention speech to attack Democrats over immigration policy. Calls out @clairecmc by name. Again, unusual political slant for this veterans audience.
Trying to unpack this. October 2017 unemployment rate for all veterans was 2.7 percent, which was certainly the lowest since the start of the Obama admin. Since then, it has crept back up as high as 4.1 percent, but still lower than the general public. https://t.co/XoHSV4dNtN
Trump says "not to believe the crap you hear from these people, the fake news." Gets standing applause from several members of the #VFWConvention crowd.
@wrmineo Go check out @bkesling's feed for a good story on that.
Trump touts that "veteran's Choice has been passed." To be clear, the Veterans Choice program was created in 2014. The new VA Mission Act he is referring to will dramatically expand community care programs like Choice. Fulfills a campaign promise to expand medical care options.

Trump says before last year's VA accountability bill, "there was nothing we could do" to misbehaving department employees. 		New rules cut down on the appeals process and streamline dismissals.
Trump gets big applause from the #VFWConvention crowd for the "largest pay raise in almost a decade," which is true. 		Then he follows it up with "It has been a long time since you have gotten a raise," which is not true. The military receives a pay raise very year.
Trump talking to the #VFWConvention now about the defense appropriations process, after rolling through a host of foreign policy issues. Light on veterans policy so far.

@balls_26 "It's moving quicker now" is very, very different than "I want to have choice, just like we have now with the veterans, all approved, which nobody thought would be possible."
@balls_26 Yes, just speculation.
@balls_26 But none of the provisions of that law are in place yet. It'll take a year to develop those rules. There's no difference for vets now than a year ago.
Also there is plenty of dispute over whether outside care is less expensive. And there are mixed feelings through the veteran community about whether the choice programs are working well.
Overlooked in all the other Trump news yesterday: The president again appears to claim his administration created the VA Choice program. In fact, outside care options for vets have been around for decades -- new rules are being written now that could expand it in coming years. https://t.co/hBq0QmXohy

@Empowlr :) I know, no worries.
@Empowlr Yep.
@laurenist Sorta kinda backed into it, but why no direct questions? "Do you still support these positions?"
Wilkie said he welcomes scrutiny of his "entire" record, takes a shot at the Washington Post for focusing only on issues decades ago. "If I had been what they implied I am, I would not have been able to work for people like Condoleezza Rice and Bob Gates."
.@maziehirono getting into this somewhat now,
We're 8 senators into questioning at Robert Wilkie's VA confirmation hearing. So far, zero questions on: 	-- his work on Jesse Helms' staff that critics called racially biased	-- his past affiliation with the Sons of the Confederacy	-- his work on Trump's transgender policy
At the 53 minute mark of the confirmation hearing, @PattyMurray references reports of Wilkie's past affiliation with Sons of the Confederacy and other controversial policy positions. But skips over questions, goes to VA policy concerns.

.@SenSanders: "Let me be blunt ..."		As opposed to?
Wilkie talking about "walking the post" as VA Secretary: "I was amazing walking into parts of headquarters and being told I was the first VA secretary they had ever seen." 		Quite the indictment of the last few secretaries.
@reporterjoe @becskaufman Not before the midterms. I have a long list of stories before any extraterrestrial travel.
Wilkie, responding to a question about VA care: "I will keep mentioning that I'm not a doctor..."		Unclear if that's a hedge or a reference to the last guy, who was a doctor (and did mention it in testimony when relevant).
Wilkie acknowledges numerous vacancies within the VA system but warns that "a blunderbuss approach to filling them will not work." Promises a measured push to find the right people.
For what it's worth, Wilkie's remarks about focusing on customer service and veterans experience with all of VA were very close to those of former VA Sec Bob McDonald.
Under questioning, Wilkie says the inspector general "is not subordinate to the secretary." Appears to contradict the letter from acting VA Sec O'Rourke last week which chastised the IG for overreach.
.@SenatorIsakson charge to VA Sec nominee Wilkie: We've given you the resources/legislation to fix the department. "There are no more excuses anymore. Failure is not an option."

Wilkie said the new electronic medical record initiative "is also our opportunity to turn the corner and be an industry leader on opioid abuse intervention and suicide prevention." Background here: https://t.co/ygN4NPvUHF
Wilkie says as VA Secretary his "prime directive (will be) customer service. When an American veteran comes to VA, it is not up to him to employ a team of lawyers to get VA to say yes. It is up to VA to get the veteran to yes."
Wilkie: "The vets population is changing faster than we realize. For the	first time in 40 years, 1/2 of our veterans are under 65. 10 percent are now women ... For VA to thrive as an integrated health care network, it must be agile and adaptive."
Robert Wilkie's father was a combat-wounded soldier. "I watched his agonizing	recovery and that experience was on my mind when I was asked to come to VA."

@AggroAdjutant @bungdan That's a fair point for a different story, and we've written a lot about what the pay raises amount to vs. inflation and other benefits trims. But here, the fact is there have been raises each of the last 10 years.
Dems are pushing for an amendment to #FY19NDAA that limits military equipment used in national military parade. Thornberry says its unneeded, "tanks can't roll down Pennsylvania Ave" because the infrastructure can't handle it.
Savage attack by @sethmoulton on Trump's planned military parade: Said it's "such a great idea" it could "only come from a man who took five deferments to avoid serving himself." #FY19NDAA

Worth noting again: Senate Dems and Republicans (who control the Senate) signed off on delaying VA Sec nominee Jackson’s confirmation amid allegations of misbehavior. Trump is casting it as all Dems fault.
Trump said he already has his next VA Secretary nominee in mind. “It’s someone with political experience.”
Trump: “These are false accusations (against VA Sec nominee Ronny Jackson) ... I think @SenatorTester has a big price to pay for this.”
Trump on Fox News right now confirms Ronny Jackson has withdrawn his name for VA Secretary. Blames “obstructionist Democrats.”

With @RepTimWalz coming out in opposition to Ronny Jackson's nomination as VA Sec, expect to see more coming quickly. Walz is the top Dem on House Vet Affairs and a key veteran voice for the party.
Full statement from @RepTimWalz: “Not only does Adm. Jackson lack the management experience necessary to successfully lead the 360,000-person, nearly $200 billion federal agency, it is apparent there are also serious questions about his character and job performance.” https://t.co/LHyQp15a36

@saulnewton It's a problem throughout DC. But, it's amplified when the president gets it wrong. Hasn't been the Veterans Administration for 30 years.
A lot to unpack here: 	~ Dept of Vet Affairs, not "Veterans Administration" (lots of politicians make this mistake).	~ No idea what the 13 million figure here refers to.	~ The allegations about Jackson started circulating late last week, ahead of the Pompeo committee vote. https://t.co/fDtMLvCY4H

@gwinn_d @jdawsey1 I agree. The president implied that Dems are going to dredge up anything to hurt all his nominees. That has not been the case at all with VA picks, lending more seriousness to these allegations.

Local VA is a huge deal for lawmakers, but that doesn't usually manifest itself as extra difficult scrutiny for these nominees. This is a very different pick and a very different process than in the past.
FYI, this level of controversy surrounding a VA leadership pick is highly unusual. Even after the 2014 wait time scandal, senators all backed Obama's next pick to take over the dept. As I detailed earlier, no one has ever voted against a VA nominee. https://t.co/9wV7vcIh5S https://t.co/z6NiDTRdyv
@AaronMehta Not a dark horse.
Trump hints Ronny Jackson may be prepping to drop his bid to be the next VA Secretary. https://t.co/dZjq6DQ2e6
Not to be lost in the Ronny Jackson decision line --- Trump also implied that the allegations found by Senate Vet Affairs officials against the VA Sec nominee were made up by Dems upset they couldn't sink Mike Pompeo's nomination as Sec of State.
Trump, on Ronny Jackson's VA Sec nomination: "I don't want to put a man who is not a political person through a process like this ... I wouldn't do it. But it's totally his decision, I'll stand behind him."
!!! 	Trump said Ronny Jackson will decide in the next few days whether to stay the VA Sec nominee. "I asked him, 'What do you need this for?' So it's up to him."
Trump calls VA Sec nominee Ronny Jackson "one of the finest people I've ever met." Says he doesn't know about the allegations.

Asked about a timeline for bringing US troops out of Syria, Trump says "we're going to be coming home relatively soon ... but I want to come home with having accomplished with what we had to accomplish."

In his prepared testimony (but not in his spoken remarks), Mattis touts his new policy on transgender troops. "I'm confident that my recommendation to the president is in the best interests of the military and is consistent with the Constitution."
Mattis: "We will continue to establish a culture of performance where results and accountability matter on every expenditure."		In prepared testimony, that whole sentence is bolded and "every" is underlined, for even more emphasis.
@WTFNationRadio @connorobrienNH I see what you did there.
@83littlemj @connorobrienNH @ShoebobCarey Tell him there's a good spot over by the outlets.
