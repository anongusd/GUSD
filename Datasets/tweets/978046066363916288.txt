@realDonaldTrump I have a friend that is a Mexican border patrol agent he say all he does is get money 2 protect and assist mexican smugglers of all types. He laughs about it and is very well off. It's up 2 U.S. cause they just don't care. It money for them the more people cross over.
@realDonaldTrump Border patrol agents have there hands tied by leguslation. I've seen human trafficking, drug smuggling, gun smuggling, illegal entry, violence and shooting. There is so much the  normal american citizen doesn't see. A strong secure border will keep all those things in Mexico.
@realDonaldTrump I'm a mex American that had live on thr Texas border for 40 yrs. And in law enforcement 4 20 yrs. I've know 4 fact and have dealt with the following: human trafficking, drug trafficking, organized crime, jail/prison gangs. Which equals to violence and death. Build the wall!
Having live on the border 4 41 yrs of my life i have personally dealt with the under belly of the following: organized crime, prison/jail gangs, illegal entry, the drug trade and human trafficking. Its a unimaginable plague on the Texas border. Build the wall it can't hurt.
I have been in law enforcement for 20 years and i am greatful to my president Donald Trump for all money he's given to all law enforcement in Texas cities.
I'm ready 2 give our president a shout out and props for getting with such a good looking woman like stormy Daniels. U r the man sir. I'm a 40yrs old gay mex american man from Texas. And well let me tell u 4 a woman like stormy daniels id switch.
