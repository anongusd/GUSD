@NocrapNN @TwitterMoments I agree with you needing mental evaluation dosen't mean you are dangerous, but you don't let people in the military with preexisting conditions no matter what the condition is.
@grimalkin_seer @TwitterMoments A spleen requires no medical treatment after surgery, claiming to be trans requires you to take medication for life to prevent you from looking like your actual gender.
@cayce0312 @MSNBC @marianaatencio @realDonaldTrump @POTUS LOL I am never wrong !!
@MrsRenkert @TwitterMoments There is never a time after you say that you are trans that you will not need medication. Someone I personally know was told he cant join the ARMY because his spleen was removed. No other reason.
@cayce0312 @MSNBC @marianaatencio @realDonaldTrump Yes Muller, You hate @POTUS so much that you cant believe that there may be nothing there, I like @POTUS but if there is proof I am fine with him getting whatever punishment he should get. I still believe in innocent until PROVEN guilty.
@cayce0312 @MSNBC @marianaatencio @POTUS @SpeakerPelosi @SenSchumer That is my point, you hate @POTUS so much that you cant believe that there may be nothing there, I like @POTUS but if there is proof I am fine with him getting whatever punishment he should get. I still believe in innocent until PROVEN guilty.
@cayce0312 @MSNBC @marianaatencio @realDonaldTrump That is my point, you hate @POTUS so much that you cant believe that there may be nothing there, I like @POTUS but if there is proof I am fine with him getting whatever punishment he should get. I still believe in innocent until PROVEN guilty.
@MrsRenkert @TwitterMoments I do believe that it is a "mental condition", but what I am saying is if you believe you are the opposite sex you are going to go through some stuff for example, go to war see bad stuff PTSD real problem real people.
@cayce0312 @MSNBC @marianaatencio @SpeakerPelosi @SenSchumer No, @SpeakerPelosi didn't want the american people to see so she could go out later and tell you what she wanted you to hear. Put it all on TV and then everyone will see what is going on.
@cayce0312 @MSNBC @marianaatencio @SpeakerPelosi @SenSchumer That is fine with me put it all on TV then everyone can see what is going on.
@cayce0312 @MSNBC @marianaatencio LOL Two years and eight million american taxpayer dollars with absolutely nothing to show for it. Don't you think if there was anything there they would have shared it? Remember they hate @realDonaldTrump
@MrsRenkert @TwitterMoments I agree, but that doesn't mean you can get in with physical or mental conditions. you cant even get in as a single parent, or if your spleen is removed. like i said there is a difference between getting in and it happening while you are in.

What was the saying God, Family, Country?
@cayce0312 @MSNBC @marianaatencio @POTUS @SpeakerPelosi @SenSchumer No, How is it immoral to see our country get better and see people without jobs get back to work?
@EppardBruce @MSNBC @POTUS @SpeakerPelosi That is correct zero for the border wall is not called compromise how is that confusing?
@EppardBruce @MSNBC @POTUS @SpeakerPelosi So you think we don't need a border wall then. look up tv show dope s1e3 and tell me that it is made up! Only an idiot thinks walls and fences don't work? Why do we fence everything in the US?
@EppardBruce @MSNBC @POTUS @SpeakerPelosi They offered the one billion that was already in the budget for border security and zero for a border wall and wanted to get almost 7000,000 people free citizenship. Border security starts with a wall that is just common sense.
@cayce0312 @MSNBC @marianaatencio @POTUS @SpeakerPelosi @SenSchumer I don't think either party is gaining I said they believe it. I don't think either lies are okay, but I like what he is actually getting done for this country, taxes, stock market, fair trade, steel and coal in the US, exporter of fuels, gas prices down.......
@MrsRenkert @TwitterMoments Transgender is both a physical and a mental condition (good or bad) and requires medication and surgery that the taxpayers will have to pay for if they are allowed into the military.
@cayce0312 @MSNBC @marianaatencio So now tell me why @SpeakerPelosi and @SenSchumer wanted to get the cameras out of the oval office?
@EppardBruce @MSNBC @POTUS So you don't believe we need a border wall? That is what this boils down to either you want border security or you don't? the offer @SpeakerPelosi  offered said no border funding she even said one dollar for border security?

@cayce0312 @MSNBC @marianaatencio LOL so you think ANYONE in government is honest? I believe that the @POTUS started this and @SpeakerPelosi and @SenSchumer  are keeping it going for what they see as a political gain.
@cayce0312 @MSNBC @marianaatencio You realize that the shutdown doesn't affect any democrat inquiries right? they are still getting paid ? Didn't he make them an offer that was pretty good on TV the other night?
@EppardBruce @MSNBC @POTUS You cant be an independent or a conservative and be for the democrats? I am an independent conservative who also doesn't agree with this shutdown but I have seen your president make several attempts to talk to the other side with no response.
@cayce0312 @MSNBC @marianaatencio Ummm no I mean that democrats will do or say anything to keep your vote so tell them you are voting against them and they will open the government now!
@cayce0312 @MSNBC @marianaatencio So in you intellectually superior world what is it about?
@_waleedshahid Is that being Mocked or playing along ? it looks like they were giving him what he wanted ?
@MSNBC @marianaatencio If everyone called their congressmen and senators and told them to get this fixed they would figure something out fast! If you tell them you will be voting republican if it isn't fixed they will have it open tomorrow!!
@TonyHill5 @SMKSMART Call your congressmen and tell them to fix it now. the only way to get it fixed is pressure from both sides!
@EppardBruce @MSNBC @POTUS I was thought you were not a regular liberal and you could have a discussion beyond "I Hate Trump" but you cant see past your own ignorance. A compromise means that you both give a little to get a little. I am sure it is hard to understand.
@NBCNews this is where idiots get their news (lady Gaga really)!!
@KamalaHarris spend the time you are preaching about opening the government to actually get it open, go have this discussion right now and televise it so everyone can see who is wrong, if you believe you are in the right here!
@KamalaHarris If you go now and have a discussion (debate) it could be done already!
@EppardBruce @MSNBC @POTUS At this point it is an everyone shutdown and it needs a solution that means BOTH parties need to give in and fix it!
@EppardBruce @MSNBC @POTUS okay so compromise and find a solution? take out daca and give him 4 billion? I don't know the answer but I do know that going into a discussion (or not going at all) with a I hate Trump no matter what is the wrong answer!
@MrsRenkert @TwitterMoments Now you think we are not the land of the free? Where have you been?
@TwitterMoments How is it negative? I know people that cant get in because of a spleen, the government doesn't want to take in people with preexisting conditions? not to mention their mental health!
@EppardBruce @MSNBC @POTUS Did you not see the offer he made? Maybe you just hate him so much you cant see.  I think he is the one offering to compromise and she is just keeping the government closed!
@Jesus_was_a_Lib It sucks that you have been thrown into a situation that you shouldn't be involved with. call your congress and tell them to go to the table and open the government! the reality is that we do need a border wall , and that it shouldn't be affecting you and your family!
@MSNBC If she was at the white house talking to @POTUS  she could get the government open today!!
@MSNBC @AriMelber He is doing more for this country in less time and he is doing it for free, you still complain! what are we paying your democrat leaders to sit and obstruct for the next 2 years?
