@jay_hernandez @realDonaldTrump @CNN @nowthisnews I get it, he's not polished and comes off as crass sometimes but Hollywood was his friend (including many prominent black figures) were his friends...now he's a racist? Anyways, I'm a fan of your acting man, have been for a while, keep up the good work.
@jay_hernandez @realDonaldTrump @CNN @nowthisnews All I'm saying is man, you seem to be drinking the kool-aid the mainstream media is pushing. I'm also Latino and everything they're trying to say about him hating Hispanics isn't true. The country as a whole just isn't used to such a straight forward president.

@MorOhmic @atrupar @KellyannePolls @IvankaTrump @PressSec @FLOTUS The the moment anyone on the left is reviled or confronted/intimidated, they report to Twitter, play the victim card, or even CREATE A FAKE STORY of being assaulted. Lol this is too easy.

@MorOhmic @atrupar @KellyannePolls @IvankaTrump @PressSec @FLOTUS The majority of media outlets as well as some admin agencies showing a clear bias speaks for itself as well.

@ZachRippett @emrazz @RobLowe Lol uh. Definitely more offensive in general.  And it's not just him in Virginia that's at the center of a negative spotlight...so there's that. He made a joke, that people started complaining about. But since you and others love this outrage culture so much, here we are. Thx.
@ZachRippett @emrazz @RobLowe Have not been on the internet lately? Either we she was being critical of his tweet on the matter. I said to be equally critical. You made it about jokes, not me.
@ZachRippett @emrazz @RobLowe Did you read mine? Yes people get offended by jokes, so by your logic what about African-Americans in regards to the leadership in Virginia? My point being, if neither of these parties did these things, there would be no jokes for everyone to be offended by.
@MacEnvy @emrazz @RobLowe "Attempted" "whether or not she was successful in the attempt is another matter" lol ^^ 		Also not opinion. She did, tried to make it less bad, failed at that too. 		Also I saw no valid counter argument rooted in fact. Nice try.
@MacEnvy @emrazz @RobLowe Is that not specific enough? If you don't understand the meaning of my response then I can't help you. She at the very least, attempted to use the claim to help her. Whether or not she was successful in the attempt is another matter.
@ZachRippett @emrazz @RobLowe So had she not started this narrative, or at the very least just owned up to it, this would have died a long time ago. Also if we are to be critical of some, why not hold everyone to the same standard?

@Noxyena @benshapiro @APA_Monitor @APA Furthermore the study is saying masculinity as a whole isn't healthy or good. Not instead saying, extreme amounts of it can be detrimental. As with literally anything else. Too much feminism, too liberal, too conservative, and pretty much anything else could be used here.
@Noxyena @benshapiro @APA_Monitor @APA I mean, @benshapiro isn't going to give uneducated takes on things. And on the off chance he does, then he'll engage in a conversation to prove his point. He doesn't strike me as a person who would speak on a topic if he was ignorant on the matter.
@Noxyena @benshapiro @APA_Monitor @APA You can still conduct a sound research study with data being accurate but it doesn't mean the overall study isn't misleading. Sample size, demographic of sampling, and opinions of the researchers all come into play.

@TheHurricane_H @charliekirk11 Fair point to you, however, there is just an abundance of misinformation out there coming from both sides. Since the wall is currently the focal point, my goal was to remind others that it was at one point considered. Then, to further shed light through civil conversation.
@benshapiro @APA_Monitor @APA 		If you want to maintain credibility, you needs to take note of what many people think of your new guidelines in regards to masculinity. This is a great start.
