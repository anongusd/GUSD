Voting for #fullrepeal because #obamacare raises taxes, raises #healthcare costs and makes it harder for #smallbiz to hire. We can do better
#Obamacare #healthcare takeover replaces personal decisions w/ 13,000 pages of regulations. #Fullrepeal is step toward patient-centered care
I support #Fullrepeal because #Obamacare's board of unelected bureaucrats limiting seniors' access to care is NOT how to protect #Medicare.
President Obama's #Medicare actuary reports #Obamacare harms doctors and hospitals that serve #seniors, limiting their access to vital care.
The President's own studies say #obamacare will increase #healthcare costs by $310 billion. #Fullrepeal means more affordable care.
#FullRepeal of #Obamacare means delivering on our promise to protect #seniors' access to care from the law's $575 billion #Medicare cut.
#fullrepeal of #Obamacare means relief from the law's $800 billion in new and higher taxes on families and #smallbiz in this economy. #tcot
