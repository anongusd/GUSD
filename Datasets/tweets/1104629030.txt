@Acosta But you always ask the same stupid questions, as if somebody has scripted you those lines so that you will repeat them. When are you going to ask a real good question? Something with value, something that we can learn from.
After this small defeat, and the Democrats taking over the Congress, I see it already that the next two years are going to be full of obstruction, resistance iand the left media asking the same stupid questions.
