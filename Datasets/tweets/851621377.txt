This bipartisan legislation will hold these countries accountable for failing to cooperate adequately with our drug enforcement efforts. I‚Äôm grateful to Senators Toomey and Jones and Congressman Connolly for their leadership on this important bill.‚Äù 3/
Protecting our communities from illicit fentanyl and fentanyl analogues will require an all-hands-on-deck effort, including better cooperation from the foreign nations from which these deadly drugs are produced and trafficked into our country. 2/

The last two years were filled with many successes for the American people, and we must charge ahead to ensure security, restore liberty, and increase opportunity for all. ‚Äú #SOTU

"Just over a month ago, Congress and the President found a way to come together and pass historic, bipartisan criminal justice reform‚Äîthe culmination of an effort I was proud to lead for over a decade.
Washington, D.C.‚ÄìCongressman Jim Sensenbrenner (WI-05) offered the following statement after President Trump delivered his second State of the Union address:
POTUS: "... from the snowy woods of Wisconsin and the red deserts of Arizona... Together, we represent the most extraordinary Nation in all of history." #SOTU
POTUS: Everything that has come since -- our triumph over communism, our giant leaps of science and discovery, our unrivaled progress toward equality and justice -- all of it is possible thanks to the blood and tears and courage and vision of the Americans who came before. #SOTU
POTUS: "Let us work together to build a culture that cherishes innocent life.  And let us reaffirm a fundamental truth:  all children -- born and unborn -- are made in the holy image of God." #SOTU
This market-driven solution is estimated to save the American taxpayer billions of dollars and will make it easier for individuals to purchase more affordable prescriptions.‚Äù #CREATESAct https://t.co/g1IASRsPle

The American people deserve to be safe in our homes and communities, and I implore my friends on the other side of the aisle to work with us to that end.‚Äù 4/
I have supported efforts to beef up border security throughout my career and am proud to have reintroduced the BUILD WALL Act, which would divert money and assets seized from drug cartels to fund for our southern border. 3/
Experts agree that physical barriers, coupled with other technology-supported solutions, work and are needed. 2/
Rep. Sensenbrenner on #SOTU: ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs imperative that Congress provide the much needed resources to secure our borders, cut off the flow of drugs and illegal immigration, and ensure the safety of the American people. 1/

#PROMESA will bring lawful order to the chaos in Puerto Rico and mitigate the humanitarian crisis happening there.

Thanks to @RepGoodlatte @HouseJudiciary &amp; my colleagues in the Senate for their tremendous work making this issue a priority. #COARA
#COARA is fully offset and contains strong accountability provisions to ensure funding is spent wisely.
#COARA is a common sense, bipartisan approach that addresses the issue head on &amp; will make a positive impact on our fight against addiction.
It is imperative we pursue aggressive measures to stint opioids' dangerous progression for a stronger, more prosperous America. #COARA
#COARA's grant program contains 8 allowable uses for funds, giving states flexibility in responding to the epidemic within their borders.
#COARA authorizes the AG to make grants available to states &amp; localities for a number of services related to opioid and heroin abuse.
In town hall meeting &amp; on social media, lawmakers are hearing heartbreaking stories from families &amp; friends of addicted individuals #COARA
Drug overdose deaths have increased 137 percent since 2010, with opioid related overdose deaths increasing by 200 percent. #COARA
Nearly half a million Americans lost their lives to drug overdoses in 2015.  #COARA
Drug overdoses now surpass automobile accidents as the leading cause of injury-related death for Americans between the ages of 25 and 64.
The misuse of &amp; addiction to opioids such as heroin, morphine, &amp; other prescription pain medicines has a devastating hold on this country.

The #SecondChance Act helps ensure that released inmates have the necessary foundation to become productive, contributing citizens.
The #SecondChance Act increases accountability by requiring periodic audits of grantees to ensure that federal dollars are spent responsibly
The #SecondChance Act reduces recidivism, leads to better outcomes for those released from prison, and saves prison costs.
The #SecondChance Reauthorization Act is firmly grounded in evidence-based practices.
#SecondChance Act is legislation that has garnered support from law enforcement the faith community &amp; bipartisan members in both chambers.
We know that if re-entry programs are successful, our communities will be safer while simultaneously saving taxpayer dollars. #SecondChance
It is in all of our best interests to give these individuals a second chance and a hand up. #SecondChance
Two-thirds of released inmates will end up back in jail within three years.
With no job money or place to live, returnees often find themselves facing the same pressures and temptations that landed them in prison.
We know that 95% of the people in prisons will return to society but they often leave with little preparation for life on the outside.
