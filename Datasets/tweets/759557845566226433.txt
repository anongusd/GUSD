@SallyDeal4 @realDonaldTrump I had to turn the channel within the first 20 minutes because I started getting so annoyed watching all of those Republicans standing as they applauded for every LIE a United States President told to all of us knowing full well that they were ALL LIES!!!! 	IT WAS SO EMBARRASSING
@eugenegu @realDonaldTrump DEFINITELY!!!!	I can't wait until this nightmare is over and they finally get what they deserve.
@Ronald__Rump @maddow @FBI Trust me, they all have the evidence, know everything and what's coming out on MSNBC, CNN and the newspapers is probably old news and only a small portion of all the shit that they've got on "Trump and Friends".  He better worry about SDNY instead of Mueller.

@SuiteLadyOro I definitely don't blame the parents UNLESS they were saying nothing and allowing this to happen because he was paying them. 	If Aaliyah's parents had pressed charges against him, do you think he'd be in jail right now? 	I just hope that none of the parents took money.
@SuiteLadyOro But was it always about the money that made so many people turn a blind eye to what he had been doing for so long? 	Just watching so many people talking about things they've seen and heard over the years but never did anything to protect these kids has bought tears to my eyes.
IT'S ABOUT TIME THAT HE FEELS SOME CONSEQUENCES FOR WHAT HE'S DONE TO OUR BLACK TEENAGE GIRLS!!! NO MORE SUPPORTING THIS SERIAL CHILD MOLESTER!!! PLEASE SIGN THE PETITION.		Tell RCA #MuteRKelly! https://t.co/geVugrAT6E

@UROCKlive1 😂😂😂😂😂. I still can't figure that one out.
@realDonaldTrump You're the only National Security threat right now so I'm hoping that after you get the Mexican money for the wall and finish it, there will be legislation passed to make sure you're DEPORTED and put on the other side of that wall or DEPORTED TO RUSSIA. You deserve more than jail
@rkelly UNFUCKINGBELIEVABLE!!!	Check out some of his comments. Some are still standing by this sick fuck, and a lot of them are females. WTF is wrong with these people?? 	If you don't have daughters, think about your Nieces, Cousins, Sisters, etc.... SMFH 😠😠 😠😠 😠😠 😠😠 😠 https://t.co/rbjamhFKXZ
@rkelly He would have never gotten away with this shit for so long if it were teenage white girls. And I'm furious with people from our communities that defended him, continued to put money in his pocket, listened to his music and blamed/defamed the girls after Aaliyah &amp; after the trial.

@maydaymindy9 Making him poor would probably be more painful for him than prison time. Take back all the money he's STOLEN from people and companies over the last 30 yrs and money I'm sure he's pocketed from us, the tax paying Citizens of this country.
@maydaymindy9 Neither. Instead,once indicted &amp; found GUILTY  federal &amp; NY state gov'ts take assets &amp; money, require him to do his time at the same locked facility where the "kidnapped" brown kids are, put him in a cage &amp; give him the aluminum foil blanket they gave the kids.
