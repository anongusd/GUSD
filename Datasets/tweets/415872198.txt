@McD_Canada being silent on peanuts not good comms strategy. Did same for "Supersize Me". Backfired. #NotLovingIt
@McD_Canada why allow open containers of peanuts in your kitchens? This is a deal breaker...

@AirCanada again. Are you reading this?? I'm saying you should list "nuts" in the menu since your salad contains large pieces of nuts.

@AirCanada did you even read my tweet? Your. Ingredients. Are. Not. Listed.
@AirCanada allergic to nuts and asked if nuts in salad. Attendant said no but there were and I ate them. Should list https://t.co/td8kO492SV
@UPexpress how does this happen? Seriously?? Thanks I'm in a taxi!
@UPexpress train delayed, like TTC, due to "signal issues". Because this brand new train didn't cost enough...
