This hour is best for reflecting on issues of recognition, self expression, rehearsing, speechwriting, and taking care of affairs behind the scenes.  This is a good hour for concentration, becoming informed of the issues, watching the news, and planning political strategy.
For those disposed to the mundane, it is a good hour to design resumes, seek favors or the assistance of fatherly types and to seek agreements.  It is not a particularly good hour for relaxation as the mind will tend to be more active than normal for this time of night.
