Corollary: In a situation like this, where intel officials think it’s a security risk but potus waves him in, do they sit down with Kushner &amp; at least brief him on what inducements/weaknesses foreign giants might use to get at him? What to watch out for? Or is it a free for all?
Yes the pres appears to have lied about this, but the most pressing issue here has always been that Kushner (fresh off MBS meetings in Saudi) is handling top secret natsec info and may be compromised. The Am public doesn't know why he's a security risk or what the damage might be https://t.co/NA0ebERsvI

COHEN on TRUMP: "I fear that if he loses the election in 2020 that there will never be a peaceful transition of power."

It's easy to miss in the glare. But GOPs have not gone after Manafort, Popadop, Flynn, or any of the Trump associates who've pled to/been convicted for lying. They're angrily going after Cohen, the former RNC deputy finance chair. The difference appears to be he's turned on Trump

There it is: "Ive never been to Prague. I've never been to the Czech Republic."		It's like everyone finally got that sneeze out.

Anyway, solidarity with @jorgeramosnews and the journalists of @UnivisionNews doing their jobs. And let it be one, small, relatively banal lesson on what happens when a govt believes it benefits from intimidating and bullying a free press. x
After that, &amp; some more sugary intimidation talk about defending Venezuela, they decided to take off. I'll never forget the smile the hotel manager (the guy who called the goons of course) gave once it was over. Invited us to join him for a drink. I very impolitely declined.
After smoke-filled interrogation subsided, it was time to search our rooms. A gang of dudes picked through our bags, our clothes, our underwear. Found some powerpoints on the Venezuelan economy (real top-line stuff) and confiscated it. seemed to enjoy scrolling thru camera pics.
Questioning went on for well over an hour. Who do you work for, are you trained in surveillance? Why would you want to undermine the government? Don't you like free health care and education? Huh?? I'm just here to report on the referendum for my wire. It's big news.
I stuck to my story that I was just a high school teacher. Friend had already outed themselves as a journo. Goon squad said they would have to take her in a separate room alone for questioning. We protested, &amp; asked them to help us fend off the idea that they were thugs or worse
Good cop / bad cop routine started immediately. The demanded our ID and said we have to go to the station with them. The good cop eased him off, saying it was adequate if we just answer some questions in the hotel. Then they tried to separate us.
Strolled into the (pretty seedy) hotel lobby to find at least 10 plain clothed young men milling around, like they were waiting for someone. Turns out they were.
I wasn't working that week, also wasn't about to tip off the Chavez gov't that an American journo was in Caracas when the govt was on the bubble. Put "teacher." Friend didnt think so fast. Put "journalist" on the card and didn't think of it again. Until we got back from dinner...
Myself and another journalist were in Caracas during the second constitutional referendum. Friend was covering it for a wire service, I was tagging along on vacation. Hotel required guests to fill out cards, including nationality and occupation.
I can sympathize with @jorgeramosnews and his detention and harassment by the Venezuelan govt. Brings back memories of visiting Venezuela in 2007 and getting muscled by Hugo Chavez's goons.

Stipulating that KAM is opposed to walls is to imagine what his existence would be like without them: A pointless, aimless life with no one to shock, surprise, or refresh. Family Guy, and probably others, have flirted with this premise.

The Jewish solidarity with the black man’s plans for justice. The bumbling racist gang bent on evil doings. Sheriff Bart even posed as a Klansman to infiltrate Hedley Lamar’s gang!
I absolutely loved “Blakkklansman” and couldn’t stop thinking about it after I saw it. After a while I realized why: It’s IRL “Blazing Saddles.” The black man who has the wits and the will to do what the white cops can’t and won’t. The goofish evil racist boss (that’s Hedley!)

I’m willing to be wrong about this and may yet be proven so. But unless Dr Ford completely crumbles, which is highly unlikely, I say Brett Kavanaugh is done. -30-
And Jeff Flake? Who knows. “If you believe the charges are true, then you vote no.” It’s a parlor game, but Flake is retiring, driven out by Trumpism. He’s based his entire exit on a scathing critique of his party’s acquiescence. High profile rebukes can be fun. Hi, Sen McCain.
Meanwhile, as reported by @jbendery, Murkowski already has enormous  parochial pressure from Native Alaskans to vote no on Kavanaugh because of his views on native sovereignty. They were key to saving her Senate career when she lost the GOP primary, so don’t sleep on that.
Collins herself said if Kavanaugh was dishonest with the Senate, she’d have a problem. Pretty clear he probably was, and it makes sense to assume angry Dems senators like Leahy have been working her behind the scenes making sure she’s seen that testimony.
But credibility was also an issue before Ford’s allegations blew up. Not as  widely covered, but Kavanaugh at a minimum strained credibility when he  claimed before Judiciary, on two separate occasions, no knowledge of stolen strategy emails as WH staff secretary.
But that’s why McConnell is scheduling the votes so quickly. Get Kavanaugh  in, or vote him down, get it done and move on fast. Kavanaugh is utterly  replaceable. Many other great conservative picks are available. Another  incentive, given his problems, pointing to his defeat.
*One caveat*: Though McConnell would happily approve a new pic in the lame duck, that might be hard to pull off if the election goes especially badly for GOPs. In that sense, Kavanagh maybe a bird in hand and one incentive pushing GOPs to stick with him.
Remember that regardless of the midterms, the GOP has the Senate majority until January. Lots of time. And if you think Mitch McConnell wouldn’t Lame Duck a SCOTUS seat, you haven’t been paying  attention, at all.
But how can they deal such a blow to Trump &amp; the critical GOP judicial project? In reality Kavanaugh is expendable. If Kavanaugh  goes down, another nominee can spring from Trump’s list in a week. It’s still September. Plenty of time to introduce, vet &amp; vote a conservative pick.
... you get to the obvious, specific, massive red flag of confirming a man credibly accused of sexual assault.
This is a 35-yr SCOTUS pick. I doubt Murkowski &amp; Collins would be ok being perceived as facilitating a setback to women and their fundamental equality. If Ford is credible, that’s the politics of this thing even before...
This all happens against the broader climate. Dr Ford is of course coming forward as #metoo is sweeping the country. While measuring Ford’s  credibility, some (not all) senators will also look at how the country is changing, and deciding what side of history they want to be on.
...a grown adult choosing, now, to be dishonest in an effort to get on the Supreme Court. Again, credibility.
Kavanaugh has undermined his own credibility in his media push. The “choir boy” defense doesn’t hold up given all we know about his high school culture &amp; behavior. That doesn’t make him guilty of assault. It makes him...
After media vetting, there’s no reason to think Ford won’t come across as credible, after swearing before the nation her testimony is the true, and now after showing she discussed it w others in 2013. That alone should be enough to secure No’s from 2 GOPs,  but there’s much more.
First the most obvious: As Jeff Flake said, this all comes down to Christine Blasey Ford’s testimony Thurs. If you believe her, you vote no. This isn’t a court of law. There’s no reasonable doubt. It’s a political forum. If Ford is credible, Kavanaugh is sunk.
Here’s an unsolicited prediction, Twitter. Born of nothing but close reading from afar and the experience of having covered 6 SCOTUS nominations close up: I don’t see how Brett Kavanaugh gets on the Supreme Court.

Several have pointed out and I agree. Erosion of trust did not start in the summer of ‘16. But it’s accelerated, stoked, weaponized. Feature, as they say. Not a bug.
There’s not much point in accurately diagnosing an erosion in trust in political institutions unless we can be honest about what and who is doing their best to cause it
And the decline in trust is downstream of what? 	-elections are “rigged”	-millions vote illegally/voter fraud crisis	-press is the “enemy”	-“Deep State”	-the president isn’t a citizen	-just 68 died in PR/Maria	-media ref working	-Nunes memo		(it’s strategy) https://t.co/REj64PfcqK
