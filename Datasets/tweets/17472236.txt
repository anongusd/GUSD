That's why Congress recognizes tribes' decisions about children who are tribal members that are in state child welfare systems.  ICWA
Inherent tribal sovereignty includes tribal governmental responsibility for children who are tribal members/citizens.
American Indians, unlike other US minorities, are separate nations and part of the United States. Tribes retain inherent sovereignty.
