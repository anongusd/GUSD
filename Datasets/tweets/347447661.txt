@rewegreatyet @ProperOpinion Gleeful and continued stomping on little people by journos is more on point here. The quick hit without context or seeking comment is not journalism.  Itâ€™s fun twitter battle I suppose but itâ€™s not journalism.
@ProperOpinion Very thoughtful thread.
@sunwilsun @ComfortablySmug under-rated tweet :)
@beyondreasdoubt @ComfortablySmug Whatâ€™s equally insane is that the investigative resources could have been directed to justice for any of the non-celebrities below who lost their lives. https://t.co/bdo6FejvZ0
@politicalmath People do realize of course.     An electric arc furnace canâ€™t creat raw steel from ore.   We really shouldnâ€™t just live in a fantasy world on this stuff.
@bpopken I find this to be targeted harassment.  Atop your self-righteous hill, claiming that your view can be heard and none others.
@SRuhle This petty sniping is beneath you.
@ComfortablySmug @jdawsey1 TBH that also looks more like a cobbler than a pie.
@ComfortablySmug @AOC In 1910, an estimated 40% of the population of the southern United States was infected with hookworm.  The Rockefeller Sanitary Commission for the Eradication of Hookworm Disease (RSC) was created with the intention of eliminating the disease across the region.
@AdamMDG @ComfortablySmug Underrated tweet and President :)
@jmeacham One of the four articles of impeachment brought by the House against President Bill Clinton and one of the two tried in the Senate was obstruction of justice.  This isnâ€™t hysteria or hyperventilating, itâ€™s history.

@peterjhasson @Uber I had them drive my 15 year old son in a pinch and the driver drove them not home but to downtown DC and left them there.  I called to complain and they told me I was in danger of losing my account because I canâ€™t have a minor on an unaccompanied trip.
