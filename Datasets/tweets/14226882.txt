A6. You can make a public comment before the April 2nd deadline to tell USDA Secretary Sonny Perdue how much SNAP means to our community and your family and urge him to protect SNAP. #HandsOffSNAP https://t.co/dZNP4AQJqJ
A5. There is no proof that imposing harsher time limits reduces poverty. Instead, this proposed rule will lead to increased hunger and hardship, especially for low-income children‚Äîthe largest beneficiaries of SNAP. #HandsOffSNAP
A4. Federal law already requires that states limit SNAP eligibility for adults without dependents. The USDA‚Äôs proposed rule would make it harder for states to apply for waivers that currently provide states flexibility in areas and times of high unemployment. #HandsOffSNAP
A4. The Trump Administration announced its proposed SNAP rule just as the President signed a sweeping farm bill that rejected harmful changes. What the Administration failed to do through legislation, is now being pushed through executive action. #HandsOffSNAP
A3. Restricting state waivers would also hurt many people of color, who often face discrimination and other deep-rooted factors that contribute to higher unemployment. Both African Americans and Latinos are likelier than whites to lose their jobs during recessions. #HandsOffSNAP
A2. By USDA‚Äôs own estimates, 755,000 adults would lose access to SNAP benefits. The proposed rule would also cut $15 billion in SNAP benefits over ten years. #HandsOffSNAP
A2. Faced with stagnant wages, a federal minimum wage that is too low, and a growing racial wealth gap, benefit programs like SNAP help Latino families stay healthy and put food on the table.#HandsOffSNAP
A1. More than 40 million Americans, including 10 million low-income Latinos, use #SNAP. In 2015, SNAP lifted at least 1.2 million Latinos out of poverty and some estimates put that number even higher. #HandsOffSNAP
