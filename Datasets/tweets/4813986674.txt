#BernieSoBlack he praised Jesse Jackson at an event in #Selma rather than the honoree, @HillaryClinton.		Oh, no wait. That ACTUALLY HAPPENED. https://t.co/BDPwdW0n6L

@mgranville1 Would his rape essay qualify as an article on a social subject?
@tomwatson https://t.co/e1ehvanICw
This is literally what BernieBros do. They can't refute your arguments so they attack your physical appearance. They're even more brutal towards women and people of color and they won't stop until we crush their candidate of choice. Again. https://t.co/yxm2FFK1Cg
@TheShaunNavarro @RascalPinkish @BernieSanders https://t.co/s16CQCzBWD
@baxtus2 https://t.co/rxcuz8U4xP		South Carolina has the third-worst internet service in the country. 1 in 5 don't have a home computer and 13% of those that do don't have internet. This poll is skewed toward affluent South Carolina voters and isn't reflective of the overall electorate
@tomwatson https://t.co/pDiMP3DlCJ
@AndrewDavies @DANNY_DICKBLOOD @BernieSanders Interesting to see how Andrew from Amsterdam is so concerned about #VettingBernie ü§îü§îü§î
@baxtus2 I do understand how polling works and any poll that rejects cell phones is automatically missing out on a large segment of the population.
@MrDane1982 https://t.co/TDyLymMmpK
Friendly reminder that while @BernieSanders is in Selma today, he has ignored black allies and activists in Vermont for 30 years. #VettingBernie 		https://t.co/au0AFAFKNL
@Gus_802 When you know that Brooklyn is actually 51% people of color https://t.co/dFuMccIp0D
It's starting. This poll by Emerson was done entirely with landlines and an online panel (whatever that is). Regardless, it is greatly ignoring people of color and young voters, both groups who are the base of the South Carolina Democratic Party. https://t.co/JYY6Df2T8L
It boggles my mind that large crowds continuously come together to listen to an old, deranged, White man attempt to explain a country that only exists in his mind.		But enough about @BernieSanders... https://t.co/vPgQMZFI0L
A reminder as @BernieSanders kicks off his #BernieInBrooklyn event that our blog has 108 published essays #VettingBernie and doing the work that our media refuses to do.		https://t.co/9gONfFdLAk

@MCTW5 It's his MO. He gets off on feeling superior to women. He and Trump both have a messiah complex that nobody, especially a woman, knows better than they do.

Serious question: if @BernieSanders is indeed, a civil rights champion, why did he move to Vermont from Brooklyn? Why did he ignore Vermont's Black activists? Why didn't John Lewis consider him an ally? And why didn't he defend Dolores Huerta when his supporters attacked her? https://t.co/4ldSB7fBzv

@BravenakBlog @rmiskimens He's our generation's Ralph Nader. A perpetual grifter with zero legislative accomplishments. Doesn't care to understand identify politics. Believes the white working class is the Democratic base. Refuses to be transparent with his finances and tax returns. Not. A. Democrat.
@MollyMcKew Bernie knows how and why his $27 donations bought his family a $600,000 lakeside home. He just doesn't care.
@JeffMinde Guns and women. Every GOPers dream combination üòç
90% of black men and women saw through Russia's coordinated attacks to divide them and still voted for @HillaryClinton. So don't tell me that Russia's attack worked on everybody. They worked primarily on gullible white men and women, born of privilege, and easily manipulated. https://t.co/HUlm4UuR9A

For me, #JamesComey will eternally be in the same vein as Frodo Baggins.

It's hilarious how predictable the media gets as we approach an election. Of course the election is "tightening." This means it will be a close election so everyone tunes in to watch.

@SallyAlbright I've written a piece on this	https://t.co/DzhLeStyYp
@NHFTHR @SallyAlbright  https://t.co/51Gv5o4U99
@SallyAlbright His admission that he ran as a Democrat for the media exposure. His wife's corruption at Burlington College. His delusion that he can reach Trump voters. His refusal to criticize Russia or Putin. His willingness to work with Trump on a $10/hour minimum wage.
@SallyAlbright His rape essay. His vote in favor of rhe 1994 crime bill. His 5 votes against the Brady Bill. His vote against comprehensive immigration reform. His suggestion that Obama be primaried in 2012. His vote for the AUMF. His constant bickering and dismissal of the ACA.
@SallyAlbright https://t.co/Z9iK3iGUst
@SallyAlbright His embarrassing NYDN interview where he couldn't explain how he'd break up the banks. His pro-caucus views. His dismissal of southern states (read: people of color). His refusal to protect superdelegates who were threatened by his supporters.
@SallyAlbright His failure to help VTs people of color. His refusal to address his racist supporters. Calling Planned Parenthood and the Human Rights campaign "the establishment." Having his supporters attack Dolores Huerta and John Lewis.
@SallyAlbright His refusal to concede. His attacks on Hillary Clinton. His refusal to help down-ballot candidates. His comic book guy campaign manager. His enriching Tad Devine. Old Town Media's shady business. His stealing of Hillary's campaign data and threats to the DNC.
@SallyAlbright His Mexican divorce. Jane's fraud. His mystery  $10 million donation. His 637 campaign violations. His refusal to submit his tax returns. His 3 houses. His $600 jacket. His status as a millionaire. His taxpayer-funded trip to Rome. His stealing of his neighbor's electricity.
@SallyAlbright Sierra Blanca. His support for the F-35. His support for the NRA. His vote against the Amber Alert. His USSR honeymoon. His love for dictators. His arrest of protesters at this VT office. He's only passed 3 bills, 2 of them named post offices.
Doesn't work when he's supposed to. Leaves work early. Has a terrible diet. Cheats on his wife. Drug user. Bad with money. Shady friends. Absent father.		When will the @GOP admit that @realDonaldTrump is a living, breathing version of what they think of people of color? https://t.co/gGCjRdupNK

Man, what a tough week. Continuing to support the @NRA, saying that Russia had no impact on the campaign, blaming @Hillaryclinton for her nonexistent role in the Russian hacking, having your former campaign manager have documented Russian ties.		Hard to be @BernieSanders today...
@BravenakBlog 9. Tend to his 3 homes 	10. Submit his final FEC filing 	11. Apologize to Sierra Blanca 	12. Explain Old Towne Media 	13. Find Tad Devine 	14. Move to West Virginia since he's so relatable to the people there

And for the AUMF which allowed for perpetual war in the Middle East. And supported the dumping of nuclear waste on Sierra Blanco, Texas.		He'll make up any excuse for his votes.
@FallingEmpire77 @counterchekist He put himself on par with Trump by refusing to be transparent and pocketing off of his political run
Like @seanhannity, @HAGOODMANAUTHOR totally nails today's big indictment news https://t.co/52EZZWbgGW
@armandodkos Your site, @dailykos, was overrun with @BernieSanders supporters, both real and Russian, who violently attacked those who dared to support Hillary. Like Bernie, you refused to do anything about it because their hate brought in extra revenue. Spare us your faux outrage.
@FallingEmpire77 @counterchekist Why won't he release his taxes if he's so honest and fair?
@counterchekist @HAGOODMANAUTHOR also probably pocketed a few rubles during the campaign
@AriMelber $27 says Bernie refuses to acknowledge his role in the whole thing
@AriMelber Has Bernie ever said where his mystery $10 million donation came from? Or why he wouldn't release his taxes? Or how Tad Devine made millions from a shell media company? Or why he was one of two senators to vote against Russian sanctions? #BolshevikBernie
I'm not one for horror movies but the new #RobertMueller film called The 13th Indictment seems to have a lot of potential
There certainly were a lot of #Russians interested in adoptions

@BernieSanders Newsflash, Bernard. Russians helped you become a millionaire. There's a reason you were one of TWO senators who voted against Russian sanctions. 		Oh, and feel free to explain the mystery $10 million donation from a single Washington, DC address...

@RobertGatton @TheYoungTurks Hard to figure out how to primary 250 members of the "Democratic establishment" who just voted to save health care for 16 million Americans
Funny how "progressive" champions @TheYoungTurks have yet to even acknowledge the result of last night's #HealthCareVote 12 hours later...
Yes, tonight was a HUGE victory. But the lecherous @gop will continue its assault on everything we hold dear. Stay vigilant #resistence. https://t.co/1H7NmDCJNA
The fate of 16 million Americans is being put in jeopardy because the @GOP can't stand the fact that we had a successful Black president.
@peterdaou @SenSanders He's got $10 million reasons to do so
To Recap: the new @WhiteHouse Communications Director is unaware when exactly a person is, or is not, on the record with any given reporter.

So I'm gonna assume that @SusanSarandon doesn't care that her only daughter will now have to pay an extra $14,000 for her future pregnancy?
Odd that the party of "personal responsibility" just passed a bill it didn't read, didn't know its cost, and, by all accounts, didn't like

@StephenKing Obama. It already came out and flopped bigly.		https://t.co/wdqnEsk7Tr
@JenniferLeeUSA but at least his balding hair line didn't make him look like James Brown ü§°
@peterdaou Those last 3 are cause they aren't White
Your friendly reminder that not only is @oreillyfactor racist, he's also a misogynistic domestic violence offender.		https://t.co/FnDMi8eZKm
Notice how silent both @Snowden and @ggreenwald are when it's a Republican president who wants to collect information from private citizens.
LIVE White House footage of @SteveKBannon once he learned that @realDonaldTrump had found his phone and started tweeting nonsense again. https://t.co/N9DWz2Er2S

For 8 years, the @gop was united in their hatred of @BarackObama. Now cracks are rising to the surface. My latest at	https://t.co/ggc5haupVN
@seanhannity So... You're mad about someone who gave HIS OPINION on your show which you admitted is an OPINION show? https://t.co/lSKRPDDwBb
@FoxNews @POTUS I'll take news alerts never mentioned once during @BarackObama's presidency for $100, Alex.
He won't release his tax returns	His campaign used to enrich his family	His proposed legislation won't pass		But enough about @BernieSanders
Usually a president gives a statement when a foreign political opposition leader is arrested. But golf is more important to @realDonaldTrump
Who is most likely to be thrown under the bus now that Donnie Smallhands has completely blown health care bigly?
Friendly advice: Marching on behalf of a man who wants to take away health care of 24 million Americans doesn't make you a patriot.
The #FreedomCaucus is officially the Gollum of American politics. They're evil and only exist to take away power they can't have themselves. https://t.co/SBiOORgwlP
Your friendly reminder that @GOP wunderkind savant @SpeakerRyan couldn't figure out how to pass a bill with a 24-seat margin of error. https://t.co/bQGq9lP4s5
No, @realDonaldTrump, @HouseGOP, and @SenateGOP. You conceived the idea of Obamacare repeal and can't abort this idea until it comes to term
The real reason @realDonaldTrump is upset is that he realized that he won't be able to steamroll the @HouseGOP like a small-time contractor.
BREAKING: LIVE look at @realDonaldTrump at the White House reacting to @SpeakerRyan saying it's not looking good for the #AHCA vote. https://t.co/i9vEvmZYez
@BarackObama's first bill: fair pay for women	@realDonaldTrump's first bill: strip Americans' health care		Yet...both parties are the same?
@MrDane1982 @deadheadkat He's also got Russian connetions, just like Trump. 		https://t.co/6jGhO05Z7L
I'm old enough to remember when the @GOP complained that the bipartisan, year-long ACA legislation was done by "ramming it down our throats"
@Gus_802 emails that were written after Bernie had been mathematically eliminated. The bros and wikileaks don't like to mention that...
If @realDonaldTrump had actually seen #Hamilton, then he would have known the importance of backing legislation only when you have the votes
@JoyAnnReid @sadebs046 @DevinNunes don't you mean million RUBLE question?
A reminder that the @HouseGOP will be voting against the #AHCA because taking away health care from 24 million Americans is TOO GENEROUS.
