@RepSwalwell You sick corrupt political hacks are destroying our country for political gains. You're disgusting political hacks
The brand new manuscript for a new book by failed lawyer Michael Cohen shows his testimony was a total lie! Pundits should only use it.
Virtually everything failed lawyer Michael Cohen said in his sworn testimony last week is totally contradicted in his just released manuscript for a book about me. It’s a total new love letter to “Trump” and the pols must now use it rather than his lies for sentence reduction!
@Mimirocah1 @ColumbiaCAPI You should know in America we don't investigate people, we investigate crimes. Democrats are defying every ethical norm we have stood for as Americans. It's a shameful #WitchHunt that has nothing to do with justice. It's an effort to over turn an election.
@renato_mariotti @Mimirocah1 @RoKhanna #FakeNews
@Mimirocah1 now it's hush money payments or it's tax fraud or it's Russian collusion but what it never is? Reality or ethical opposition party. We see the radical deep state out of control. This is a threat to our Constitutional Republic. Trump is just a man.
@Mimirocah1 it's sickening to see a bunch of biased partisan insane Democrats chasing everything that can possibly be contorted into a crime to attack a duly elected President. It's a Democrat coup on an elected President. What happened to Russian collusion? You've lost the plot

@krassenstein that's okay, we know you are too stupid to understand the purpose of the electoral college.
Michael Cohen’s book manuscript shows that he committed perjury on a scale not seen before. He must have forgotten about his book when he testified. What does Hillary Clinton’s lawyer, Lanny Davis, say about this one. Is he being paid by Crooked Hillary. Using her lawyer?

@thomascjones @Ahab_the_Whaler @Lima_J_V @charliekirk11 @TPUSA The problem is the big money donors skirting the laws to avoid transparency.		Also when I say unions it's the public sector unions that are dangerous, not private sector unions.

@erinbliss @tedlieu your belief only goes to show your ignorance. to claim Trump is a liar means that you listen to #fakenews constantly. Let's hear a verifiable lie. Example: If you like your doctor you can keep your doctor.
@GusHinostroza @BradleyNAnders1 @FaceTheNation @RepKinzinger @realDonaldTrump you just went on a long diatribe against truth and facts. your willful ignorance is on full display. Typical Democrat insanity

@kengold @tedlieu You mean having a consistent story? No, that's not what innocent people do. Innocent people change their story with every new day like the #fakenews media does...		Are you this stupid? I mean really, WTF.
@MotherResister @tedlieu Because unlike the #fakenews narrative, the truth remains the same.
@LucySharvet @tedlieu So the truth is never ending but the #fakenews narrative keeps ivolving into whatever depraved minds want it to.

@sasddl @tedlieu if you actually cared about Russian collusion you would care but you don't
@tedlieu So you're not interested in the truth or if the Russians colluded to undermine our election? The first time I've ever heard you be honest. It's just bigotry you #hatetrump and nothing else matters

I didn't support Bush then and I don't support him now although he was not the only one to blame. Clinton played a part in pressuring banks into funding bad home loans mad it worse
@Racer92_5 @GOPLeader Obama NEVER had a year of GDP at or above 3% fist President EVER to not have at least 1 year of above 3% and Obama told us this was the new norm. 		Trying to give him credit for Trump's economy is laughable at best. more like intellectually dishonest IMHO.
@Racer92_5 @GOPLeader WTF are you talking about? I've read these forced under duress plea deals in an effort to paint a false narrative. Andrew McCabe on 60min admitted to a soft coup attempt on the president of the United States. You are missing the forest through the trees. https://t.co/MOhXXHselE
@zaphoddd @GOPLeader @HouseGOP @RepGwenMoore @WaysandMeansGOP Not to mention people that have a small business that couldn't afford the outrageous costs for private health insurance so they went without got hammered at the end if the year from the penalty. They were punished for not being able to afford insurance
@zaphoddd @GOPLeader @HouseGOP @RepGwenMoore @WaysandMeansGOP Your evidence just doesn't comport with the facts on the ground. I know many people who got stuck in the part time loop because an employer wouldn't provide health Care to newer lower level employees. places like Home Depot for instance. Walmart is another.
@rpj66 @GOPLeader @GroverNorquist It's all evidence based what the Clinton's have been doing. Unlike the #witchhunt hoax with ZERO evidence to support. You're a wilfully ignorant person.I'm not holding my breath but Just in case you want to know the truth about what's been taking place.  https://t.co/MOhXXHselE

@Qwarktastic2 Give me one example, just one will be sufficient
@Qwarktastic2 @sarahkendzior it's a fact. Democrats are obsessed with destroying the Trump administration so much so they will harm the country if that's what it takes. The shutdown cost over $5billion because the Democrats refused to fund the wall. They rather piss away the money b4 letting Trump win
@hdbob3 @Qwarktastic2 Like when Trump said he served burgers to the football team. He said the burgers were stacked a mile high. obviously he didn't mean literally however, that didn't stop the fact checkers from calling that a lie.

The Border Committee Democrats are behaving, all of a sudden, irrationally. Not only are they unwilling to give dollars for the obviously needed Wall (they overrode recommendations of Border Patrol experts), but they don’t even want to take muderers into custody! What’s going on?
“President is on sound legal ground to declare a National Emergency. There have been 58 National Emergencies declared since the law was enacted in 1976, and 31 right now that are currently active, so this is hardly unprecedented.” Congressman tommcclintock
....The fact is, when I took over as President, our Country was a mess. Depleted Military, Endless Wars, a potential War with North Korea, V.A., High Taxes &amp; too many Regulations, Border, Immigration &amp; HealthCare problems, &amp; much more. I had no choice but to work very long hours!
The media was able to get my work schedule, something very easy to do, but it should have been reported as a positive, not negative. When the term Executive Time is used, I am generally working, not relaxing. In fact, I probably work more hours than almost any past President.....

It was a very bad week for the Democrats, with the GREAT economic numbers, The Virginia disaster and the State of the Union address. Now, with the terrible offers being made by them to the Border Committee, I actually believe they want a Shutdown. They want a new subject!
I don’t think the Dems on the Border Committee are being allowed by their leaders to make a deal. They are offering very little money for the desperately needed Border Wall &amp; now, out of the blue, want a cap on convicted violent felons to be held in detention!
Gallup Poll: “Open Borders will potentially attract 42 million Latin Americans.” This would be a disaster for the U.S. We need the Wall now!
African Americans are very angry at the double standard on full display in Virginia!
Senator Richard Burr, The Chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, just announced that after almost two years, more than two hundred interviews, and thousands of documents, they have found NO COLLUSION BETWEEN TRUMP AND RUSSIA! Is anybody really surprised by this?
I think it is very important for the Democrats to press forward with their Green New Deal. It would be great for the so-called “Carbon Footprint” to permanently eliminate all Planes, Cars, Cows, Oil, Gas &amp; the Military - even if no other country would do the same. Brilliant!
Today Elizabeth Warren, sometimes referred to by me as Pocahontas, joined the race for President. Will she run as our first Native American presidential candidate, or has she decided that after 32 years, this is not playing so well anymore? See you on the campaign TRAIL, Liz!
The Democrats just don’t seem to want Border Security. They are fighting Border Agents recommendations. If you believe news reports, they are not offering much for the Wall. They look to be making this a campaign issue. The Wall will get built one way or the other!

Schumer and the Democrats are big fans of being weak and passive with Iran. They have no clue as to the danger they would be inflicting on our Country. Iran is in financial chaos now because of the sanctions and Iran Deal termination. Dems put us in a bad place - but now good!
Looking for China to open their Markets not only to Financial Services, which they are now doing, but also to our Manufacturing, Farmers and other U.S. businesses and industries. Without this a deal would be unacceptable!
More troops being sent to the Southern Border to stop the attempted Invasion of Illegals, through large Caravans, into our Country. We have stopped the previous Caravans, and we will stop these also. With a Wall it would be soooo much easier and less expensive. Being Built!

@RoKhanna @GavinNewsom That's a lie. In 2008 Californians voted to prevent gay marriage. SCOTUS voted to undermind the will of The People and California AG refused to support Californians who said NO.

FBI’s Former Top Lawyer Acknowledged ‘Unusual’ Steps In Early Days Of Russia Probe https://t.co/lYUPmbdvyw via @dailycaller
...big Crooked Hillary law firm, represented by her lawyer Michael Sussmann (do you believe this?) who worked Baker hard &amp; gave him Oppo Research for “a Russia probe.” This meeting, now exposed, is the subject of Senate inquiries and much more. An Unconstitutional Hoax. FoxNews
Former FBI top lawyer James Baker just admitted involvement in FISA Warrant and further admitted there  were IRREGULARITIES in the way the Russia probe was handled. They relied heavily on the unverified Trump “Dossier” paid for by the DNC &amp; Clinton Campaign, &amp; funded through a...
The reason Sarah Sanders does not go to the “podium” much anymore is that the press covers her so rudely &amp; inaccurately, in particular certain members of the press. I told her not to bother, the word gets out anyway! Most will never cover us fairly &amp; hence, the term, Fake News!
The United States has a great economic story to tell. Number one in the World, by far!
Last time I went to Davos, the Fake News said I should not go there. This year, because of the Shutdown, I decided not to go, and the Fake News said I should be there. The fact is that the people understand the media better than the media understands them!
Never seen senatemajldr and Republicans so united on an issue as they are on the Humanitarian Crisis &amp; Security on our Southern Border. If we create a Wall or Barrier which prevents Criminals and Drugs from flowing into our Country, Crime will go down by record numbers!
Marist/NPR/PBS Poll shows President Trump’s approval rating among Latinos going to 50%, an increase in one year of 19%. Thank you, working hard!
FBI top lawyer confirms “unusual steps.” They relied on the Clinton Campaign’s Fake &amp; Unverified “Dossier,” which is illegal. “That has corrupted them. That has enabled them to gather evidence by UNCONSTITUTIONAL MEANS, and that’s what they did to the President.” Judge Napolitano
Without a Wall our Country can never have Border or National Security. With a powerful Wall or Steel Barrier, Crime Rates (and Drugs) will go substantially down all over the U.S. The Dems know this but want to play political games. Must finally be done correctly. No Cave!
“The Democrats are playing politics with Border Security.”  foxandfriends
Nick Sandmann and the students of Covington have become symbols of Fake News and how evil it can be. They have captivated the attention of the world, and I know they will use it for the good - maybe even to bring people together. It started off unpleasant, but can end in a dream!
RT KayaJones: I want to show other celebrities who voted for realDonaldTrump it’s ok to come forward. Better yet let’s show the world how many Americans stand with him. Bullies shouldn’t be allowed for almost a year and a half to bully us without cause. If you voted for him …
Looking like Nick Sandman &amp; Covington Catholic students were treated unfairly with early judgements proving out to be false - smeared by media. Not good, but making big comeback! “New footage shows that media was wrong about teen’s encounter with Native American” TuckerCarlson
Democrats are kidding themselves (they don’t really believe it!) if they say you can stop Crime, Drugs, Human Trafficking and Caravans without a Wall or Steel Barrier. Stop playing games and give America the Security it deserves. A Humanitarian Crisis!
Four people in Nevada viciously robbed and killed by an illegal immigrant who should not have been in our Country. 26 people killed on the Border in a drug and gang related fight. Two large Caravans from Honduras broke into Mexico and are headed our way. We need a powerful Wall!

If Nancy Pelosi thinks that Walls are “immoral,” why isn’t she requesting that we take down all of the existing Walls between the U.S. and Mexico, even the new ones just built in San Diego at their very strong urging. Let millions of unchecked “strangers” just flow into the U.S.
@JenHub17 @FractalGardens And where is the collusion?  Seriously where is the evidence that this is anything but a Gestapo police state tactics of investigating men and not crimes. The left fully embraces the judge first thug mentality
@FractalGardens @renato_mariotti @GeraldoRivera @realDonaldTrump Mueller investigation hasn't produces anything except catching people in perjury traps and forcing them to plead guilty to crimes they didn't commit so they can avoid being ran into bankruptcy and spending the rest of your life in Federal prison.

Don’t forget, we are building and renovating big sections of Wall right now. Moving quickly, and will cost far less than previous politicians thought possible. Building, after all, is what I do best, even when money is not readily available!
Wow, just heard that my poll numbers with Hispanics has gone up 19%, to 50%. That is because they know the Border issue better than anyone, and they want Security, which can only be gotten with a Wall.
Nancy, I am still thinking about the State of the Union speech, there are so many options - including doing it as per your written offer (made during the Shutdown, security is no problem), and my written acceptance. While a contract is a contract, I’ll get back to you soon!
Nancy Pelosi has behaved so irrationally &amp; has gone so far to the left that she has now officially become a Radical Democrat. She is so petrified of the “lefties” in her party that she has lost control...And by the way, clean up the streets in San Francisco, they are disgusting!
No, Amnesty is not a part of my offer. It is a 3 year extension of DACA. Amnesty will be used only on a much bigger deal, whether on immigration or something else. Likewise there will be no big push to remove the 11,000,000 plus people who are here illegally-but be careful Nancy!
Nancy Pelosi and some of the Democrats turned down my offer yesterday before I even got up to speak. They don’t see crime &amp; drugs, they only see 2020 - which they are not going to win. Best economy! They should do the right thing for the Country &amp; allow people to go back to work.
Be careful and try staying in your house. Large parts of the Country are suffering from  tremendous amounts of snow and near record setting cold. Amazing how big this system is. Wouldn’t be bad to have a little of that good old fashioned Global Warming right now!

Many people are saying that the Mainstream Media will have a very hard time restoring credibility because of the way they have treated me over the past 3 years (including the election lead-up), as highlighted by the disgraceful Buzzfeed story &amp; the even more disgraceful coverage!
The Economy is one of the best in our history, with unemployment at a 50 year low, and the Stock Market ready to again break a record (set by us many times) - &amp; all you heard yesterday, based on a phony story, was Impeachment. You want to see a Stock Market Crash, Impeach Trump!
.newtgingrich just stated that there has been no president since Abraham Lincoln who has been treated worse or more unfairly by the media than your favorite President, me! At the same time there has been no president who has accomplished more in his first two years in office!
Will be leaving for Dover to be with the families of 4 very special people who lost their lives in service to our Country!
@lmsstrauss @RogueSNRadvisor Nonsense? Show me anything they got wrong. ANYTHING that is inaccurate and I'll believe you but until then you're just sticking your head in the sand over partisan biased reasons.
@Animalism42 @wdunlap @GOPChairwoman @realDonaldTrump They do that in states with extremely restrictive gun laws like Chicago and New York. You show me a state with few gun restrictions but a high number of gun crimes and maybe we can have a discussion but as I see it more guns equals less crime.

Kevin Corke, FoxNews “Don’t forget, Michael Cohen has already been convicted of perjury and fraud, and as recently as this week, the Wall Street Journal has suggested that he may have stolen tens of thousands of dollars....”  Lying to reduce his jail time! Watch father-in-law!
Another big Caravan heading our way. Very hard to stop without a Wall!
“It’s the Democrats keeping everything closed.” JimInhofe  So true!
Why would Nancy Pelosi leave the Country with other Democrats on a seven day excursion when 800,000 great people are not getting paid. Also, could somebody please explain to Nancy &amp; her “big donors” in wine country that people working on farms (grapes) will have easy access in!

It is becoming more and more obvious that the Radical Democrats are a Party of open borders and crime. They want nothing to do with the major Humanitarian Crisis on our Southern Border. #2020!
There are now 77 major or significant Walls built around the world, with 45 countries planning or building Walls. Over 800 miles of Walls have been built in Europe since only 2015. They have all been recognized as close to 100% successful. Stop the crime at our Southern Border!

@revans3069 @melby_kyle @joeytwostops @Music_LoveAll @tonyposnanski @PressSec because they are ignoring the topic we are currently shut down over and try changing the subject. Refusing to address the humanitarian crisis at our southern border while pretending to care.
@politclpotrhead @melby_kyle @joeytwostops @Music_LoveAll @tonyposnanski @PressSec He has done all he can within reason. The Democrats have always sabotage any and all efforts towards building a wall.

@SilviaAstoria @ReginaLBrown @AdamSchiff border patrol and ice have both said they desperately need a wall. Why is it so hard to understand?
@aBroadsviews @tsully8928 @AdamSchiff Because there has been too many RINO Republicans who wouldn't do what's right. Too many that are against Trump but many of those losers are now gone so it's time to get shit done. A wall is common sense and desperately needed. Not my opinion, border patrol &amp; ICE have requested it

@CaseysmomIrene @PressSec it's not Mitch that can do the right thing. It's Pelosi who holds the purse strings to secure our southern border but she doesn't mind the child sex trade and human trafficking. All the rape and drugs are perfectly acceptable to DemonRats
@Tommy27018549 @Jeffrey75364664 @nicolejames @PressSec No it wouldn't without funding for border security...		Why are Democrats so set on allowing child sex trade and human trafficking? it seems like a sick obsession to encourage this kind of thing

Democrats could solve the Shutdown in 15 minutes! Call your Dem Senator or Congresswoman/man. Tell them to get it done! Humanitarian Crisis.
23% of Federal inmates are illegal immigrants. Border arrests are up 240%. In the Great State of Texas, between 2011 &amp; 2018, there were a total of 292,000 crimes by illegal aliens, 539 murders, 32,000 assaults, 3,426 sexual assaults and 3000 weapons charges. Democrats come back!
Democrats should come back to Washington and work to end the Shutdown, while at the same time ending the horrible humanitarian crisis at our Southern Border. I am in the White House waiting for you!
Lyin’ James Comey, Andrew McCabe, Peter S and his lover, agent Lisa Page, &amp; more, all disgraced and/or fired and caught in the act. These are just some of the losers that tried to do a number on your President. Part of the Witch Hunt. Remember the “insurance policy?” This is it!
I have been FAR tougher on Russia than Obama, Bush or Clinton. Maybe tougher than any other President. At the same time, &amp; as I have often said, getting along with Russia is a good thing, not a bad thing. I fully expect that someday we will have good relations with Russia again!
.....who is being totally protected by his best friend, Bob Mueller, &amp; the 13 Angry Democrats - leaking machines who have NO interest in going after the Real Collusion (and much more) by Crooked Hillary Clinton, her Campaign, and the Democratic National Committee. Just Watch!

“Great support for Border Security and the Wall.” foxandfriends  Even greater than anyone would know! “Presidents supporters do not want him to cave.” SteveDoocy I won’t!
There is GREAT unity with the Republicans in the House and Senate, despite the Fake News Media working in overdrive to make the story look otherwise. The Opposition Party &amp; the Dems know we must have Strong Border Security, but don’t want to give “Trump” another one of many wins!
Cryin Chuck told his favorite lie when he used his standard sound bite that I “slammed the table &amp; walked out of the room. He had a temper tantrum.” Because I knew he would say that, and after Nancy said no to proper Border Security, I politely said bye-bye and left, no slamming!

Just left a meeting with Chuck and Nancy, a total waste of time. I asked what is going to happen in 30 days if I quickly open things up, are you going to approve Border Security which includes a Wall or Steel Barrier? Nancy said, NO. I said bye-bye, nothing else works!

The Democrats want Billions of Dollars for Foreign Aid, but they don’t want to spend a small fraction of that number on properly securing our Border. Figure that one out!
We are working hard at the Border, but we need a WALL!  In 2018, 1.7 million pounds of narcotics seized, 17,000 adults arrested with criminal records, and 6000 gang members, including MS-13, apprehended. A big Human Trafficking problem.
I don’t care that most of the workers not getting paid are Democrats, I want to stop the Shutdown as soon as we are in agreement on Strong Border Security! I am in the White House ready to go, where are the Dems?
Many people currently a part of my opposition, including President Obama &amp; the Dems, have had campaign violations, in some cases for very large sums of money. These are civil cases. They paid a fine &amp; settled. While no big deal, I did not commit a campaign violation!
The Democrats could solve the Shutdown problem in a very short period of time. All they have to do is approve REAL Border Security (including a Wall), something which everyone, other than drug dealers, human traffickers and criminals, want very badly! This would be so easy to do!
Great support coming from all sides for Border Security (including Wall) on our very dangerous Southern Border. Teams negotiating this weekend! Washington Post and NBC reporting of events, including Fake sources, has been very inaccurate (to put it mildly)!

The Democrats, much as I suspected, have allocated no money for a new Wall. So imaginative! The problem is, without a Wall there can be no real Border Security - and our Country must finally have a Strong and Secure Southern Border!
Happy New Year!
HAPPY NEW YEAR TO EVERYONE, INCLUDING THE HATERS AND THE FAKE NEWS MEDIA! 2019 WILL BE A FANTASTIC YEAR FOR THOSE NOT SUFFERING FROM TRUMP DERANGEMENT SYNDROME. JUST CALM DOWN AND ENJOY THE RIDE, GREAT THINGS ARE HAPPENING FOR OUR COUNTRY!

@Angel68TX @RobKuttner @realDonaldTrump @POTUS by stopping illegal immigrants like the murderer or if California wasn't a #SanctuaryState this scum would have been deported when he was in jail last time.
@nowalkietalkies @RobKuttner @realDonaldTrump @POTUS You continue to prove my point. You're rambling about non-issue while the important issues go undiscussed. Wake up Jr, you're being played for a fool. you're a tool of the media and establishment.
@jodythedeadcat @mattgaetz You care do disclose some of the so-called conspiracy theories that he has put out.		if Trump corporation has received money for lodging and such I'm sure that it's above board and fair compensation for the space being used by the secret service. Trump lives under a microscope
@JeanneAnneBell1 @realDonaldTrump And good for him for doing it. Democrats refuse to secure our border and Christmas Eve a police officer was shot and killed 4 hours after leaving his wife and 5/mo old baby at home. It was an #IllegalAlien that should have been deported but thanks to #SanctuaryState Ca he wasnt
@scisme77 @realDonaldTrump @POTUS You watched something on TV...and remembered it???OMG I'm so proud of you.
@mattsullivan685 @realDonaldTrump While losers like you are crying about who to blame for shutting down the government here in California (a #SanctuaryState ) a police officer was murdered by an #IllegalAlien on Christmas Eve. He had a wife and a 5 month old baby.		People like you are scum
@ScienceShark @realDonaldTrump It's not for lack of trying if people like you didn't constantly act as if everything he does diserved maximum resistance maybe more good things would get done for this country.
@tritrain @jessica_hensler @realDonaldTrump So you're a big Gastapo police state supporter are you? Congratulations, you're part of the #Demonrats cult
@RobKuttner @realDonaldTrump @POTUS It's not about playing the blame game.		While fools like you follow the media dog whistle, another Police officer was murdered in California (a #SanctuaryState ) by an #IllegalAlien and @realDonaldTrump is the only one fighting to secure our border.
@natrlnancys50 What part of diplomacy does #resistance fall under?
@DarcyShoop @realDonaldTrump So you approve of Gestapo police state tactics and you once were a lawyer? 		OMG it's like we've lost what it means to be American. At least the Democrats have

@janestreet When did Trump say America is getting Rick from tariffs? 		This is the problem with #FakeNews you don't take the time to understand what Trump is doing vs. what someone's opinion is about what Trump appears to be doing.		You have a 5th grade understanding of what's happening.

@870South @realDonaldTrump @BarackObama it is very concerning that so many would still vote for Obama. He was the most corrupt President in American history. weaponized the intelligence agencies to spy on a political opponents then trying to destroy the newly elected POTUS with vicious lies &amp; Russian propaganda.
@870South The left is a radical mob. Chasing people out of restaurants, rioting and attacking people at collage discussions and debates. 	ANTIFA=Democrats	KKK=Democrats	now give me an example of Conservatives doing anything comparable.
@DaxSmith5 @realDonaldTrump You're an ignorant hateful person. Obama was by far the worst President in American history. A criminal from start to finish including trying to rig the 2016 election, weaponized our intelligence agencies and turning them on the incoming elected President.

@tturner1234 @dbongino For the Clinton 's the American People get no justice but for an innocent democratically elected Republican we have #fakenews making up stories whole cloth and the justice department leaving no stone unturned looking for ANY crime they can possible come up with.
@tturner1234 @dbongino Ya, it bothers the shit out of me. Not because Trump is guilty but because it's clear that we have a biased corrupt DOJ &amp; FBI that have totally ignored many many crimes by the Clinton while at the same time persecuting an innocent man for winning an election.

@meganannepiper @DineshDSouza @realDonaldTrump No seat was announced for a Democrat on election night that got overturned days later. That never happened. Every seat that was solid Republican on election night but flipped days later went to a Democrat.
@BBeameupScotty @ChrisJamesDarcy @thehill These are allegations.  You want to take accusations as fact and thats what's wrong with you Democrats is you take accusations as fact without question and suddenly you conclude Republicans are cheating but I show you convictions that U ignore b/c they don't fit your worrldmview
@JulieNCResist @lauren_hoggs Or how about this,  not violent? https://t.co/28KUw55zRf
@JulieNCResist @lauren_hoggs This isnt violence? https://t.co/agp4ry8ZbY
@meganannepiper @DineshDSouza @realDonaldTrump They are always Democrat. Not a single seat flipped from Democrat to Republican after election day however a shit load go from Republican to Democrat AFTER ELECTION DAY!  		Don't play cute, it's clear what's happening. Only an idiot couldn't see the pattern
@BBeameupScotty @ChrisJamesDarcy @thehill They even go so far as to criticize Republicans for prosecuting people who are commiting voter fraud as if thats a problem. So we should just ignore it because making people follow the law is a bad thing?		Democrats wouldn't win shit if not for massive voter fraud
@BBeameupScotty @ChrisJamesDarcy @thehill The other article describes ways of insuring election integrity. Why are Democrats so opposed to validating votes? If there is no fraud this should not be such a big deal but it is.  They don't want any effort made to protect the election integrity.
@BBeameupScotty @ChrisJamesDarcy @thehill That is who was actively suppressing voters back then. Democrats were behind the KKK and behind voter suppression.  Thats a fact, look it up if you don't believe me.
@BBeameupScotty @ChrisJamesDarcy @thehill The article refers to the people who were actually committing  voter suppression after the civil war as the "racists" and they are correct but what they fail to do is identify who those racists were... It was the Democrat party.  They conveniently leave that part out
@BBeameupScotty @ChrisJamesDarcy @thehill People had thousands of $$$ on them along with voter rolls. They are just little guys. Someone was funding them and likely funding others. These are just the ones that got caught.
@BBeameupScotty @ChrisJamesDarcy @thehill California Governor pardoned a politician who was convicted of Felony voter fraud. 9 people arrested in LA County for voter fraud. The only reason they were arrested is because local cops witnessed it happening so they used undercover video to expose it
@BBeameupScotty @ChrisJamesDarcy @thehill There was example after example. Ballots showing up in the back of rental cars.  Broward County official not allowing any oversight and not disclosing how many remaining ballets to count even though she was previously criminaly charged with voter fraud
@BBeameupScotty @ChrisJamesDarcy @thehill He wasn't the referee, they have referees at the polling places and at the counting locations. It would have been better if there was an alternative however in that one case there wasn't.  Doesn't mean there was foul play.
@BBeameupScotty @ChrisJamesDarcy @thehill And just because a Republican  (known for saying stupid shit) makes a joke doesn't mean there is voter suppression.  Democrats are the ones always trying to get every uninformed easily manipulated voter to the polls. Why is that? If someone is not informed why get them to vote?
@BBeameupScotty @ChrisJamesDarcy @thehill Thats a myth. AG Eric Holder has been aggressively gerrymandering even having districts changed recently DURING THE ELECTION CYCLE.
@BBeameupScotty @ChrisJamesDarcy @thehill So if Democrats disproportionately vote by mail and Republicans vote ealy at the poles then who would suffer from voter suppression? How are mail in ballets being suppressed? You can't have it both ways
@cenkuygur @Mediaite @benshapiro Sounds like he's encouraging violence as a form of resistance. That's not a good thing and doesn't represent the views of CNN. They are a private company that made a decision to cut ties. I don't see the problem. Are they not allowed to hire and fire whomever they want?
@TYTNetwork @YouTube You are so ignorant. The abuse of power by the Obama administration is so outrageous and must be completely exposed. Democrats have tried to criminalize politics as a Republican while allowing Democrats to completely avoid any accountability. #FakeNewsMedia is complicit

@HowardJRoss @hufman @GOPChairwoman @Cernovich @WashTimes States that are corrupt like California REFUSED to work with the Federal Government to investigate voter fraud in 2016 and still are refusing to cooperate...Why do you suppose that is???
@HowardJRoss @hufman @GOPChairwoman @Cernovich @WashTimes I just provided several examples of actual voter fraud and you respond with an article about how voter fraud isn't real. Even after an election with record high turnout... Do you have any common sense?
@HowardJRoss @hufman @GOPChairwoman @Cernovich @WashTimes Like a typical Democrat you disregard case after case of voter fraud. Wake up, these are voter fraud rings and they are nationwide problem. Democrats believe the end justifies the means.
@HowardJRoss @hufman @GOPChairwoman @Cernovich @WashTimes When VoterID was implemented, black turnout was higher. 		Claiming voter fraud is not Dem leaning is laughable. Every Rep I know is disgusted by voter fraud &amp; lack of voter ID vs Democrats I talk to says voter ID is bad &amp; ignore fraud when it's proven like you just did...Why?
@HowardJRoss @hufman @GOPChairwoman @Cernovich @WashTimes That is what there is no evidence of. With mail in ballots and motor voter registration there are endless ways to vote and turnout is at record highs so your excuse makes absolutely no sense. Also I highly doubt Jared Kushner or Brannon are out voting multiple times

@MartinAdamski1 @NatashaBertrand @DronetDr @matthewamiller your resistance profile pic.	The resistance is Democrat propaganda
@death_by_meteor @olionofjudah @ksm_kathy @kdoright @TheklaB @Comey only ROI is due to the Democrats turning it into something it's not. You don't even know what the Russians did do you? I bet you don't, you just think you know something but in reality, you know nothing.
@blumom2015 @Matt24341715 @dbongino it's the other way around. children are socialist and only after life experience and understanding do they become Conservative.

@MartinAdamski1 @NatashaBertrand @DronetDr @matthewamiller Clearly you are watching a propaganda outlet. Maybe CNN or MSNBC or CBS but whatever it is you should stop watching.

@MartinAdamski1 @Mimirocah1 I read constantly.  Trump hasn't attacked any of our important institutions.  Only the corrupt leadership within many of those institutions.  Obama weaponized so many of those institutions that some house cleaning in in order
@death_by_meteor @olionofjudah @ksm_kathy @kdoright @TheklaB @Comey Russia had NOTHING to do with Trump's election but what rigged the 2018 midterms was Democrat groups like the one busted in LA using homeless people on skid row and poll supervisors like in Florida.

@tigerhawk187 @RickReut FOX is s very reputable news outlet unless you're a CNN MSNBC brainwashed fool then you've been lead to believe otherwise. But regardless I don't watch fox and I only watch the CBS, MSNBC, CNN to debunk the lies of the week. #FakeNews
@maladamus @RickReut The fBI, DOJ, IRS and countless other agencies were weaponized by Obama and the Democrat party. Thats a FACT. Back before the 2012 elections the IRS was targeting conservatives preventing hundreds of non profit groups from ever getting started.
@maladamus @RickReut Don't conflate the 2 items. Pizzagate was a conspiracy theory and she didn't leave years earlier, she was FIRED for her failure to keep our Ambassador alive in Benghazi.  You are correct &amp; thank God she is not and will not be President because she is a swampland of corruption.
