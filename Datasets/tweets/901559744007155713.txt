@callensmom11 @sltrib We named our Baby A, Donald Gardner Collins, Donald after a Beloved family friend who is like another Grandfather, and Gardner after my GrandDad.
@callensmom11 @sltrib And we learned that day that Baby B was, as we had hoped, a daughter.
@callensmom11 @sltrib We were allowed to take some time to digest the news before deciding whether or not to continue with our initial purpose for that day’s appointment. Ultimately we decided since we were already there to go ahead with the amnio.
@callensmom11 @sltrib She explained that no, if it were related to anything I had done, that would likely have affected the whole pregnancy.
@callensmom11 @sltrib So many questions! Could  it have been something I had done? Or related to our recent travel? We had just returned from visiting loved ones in Kansas City, including the namesake for this little one.
@callensmom11 @sltrib Until the doctor came in a few minutes later. She sat down and very compassionately told us that although he measured the same as his siblings, Baby A had simply ‘stopped.’  He no longer had a heartbeat.
@callensmom11 @sltrib She said “I’ll have the doctor come talk to you about Baby A.”  That caught me up short - I thought we were here for Baby B? But I really had to use the bathroom and put it out of my mind.
@callensmom11 @sltrib At that 16 week appointment the ultrasound tech kept an amazingly good poker face throughout the exam. She gave us no indication of anything amiss until the very end as I was hopping off the table to go use the bathroom.
@callensmom11 @sltrib We had early genetic testing done to make sure that the remaining fetuses were healthy. They could not test Baby B because of the position relative to my bowel. Results: 2 genetically healthy boys. And we scheduled an amniocentesis for 16 wks
@callensmom11 @sltrib As another preemie mom, I wholeheartedly agree!  My very much wanted and longed-for pregnancy was initially quadruplets (at the initial ultrasound at 7 weeks).  At the second ultrasound there were only three heartbeats, although still four sacs.
@callensmom11 @sltrib My miracle twins were also born at 24 weeks. They will be 16 years old on Feb. 28
