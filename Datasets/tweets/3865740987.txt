"Many may be exceptionally smart, passionate and articulate beyond their years, but they do not possess any semblance of wisdom because they have not lived those years. Their knowledge of history, law and public policy is severely limited (Common Core certainly hasn’t helped)." https://t.co/uP0sxoWqRE
@susanM7777 @QuinnforLD17 @sgstotsky @michellemalkin @StopCommonCoreG @michaelgendre @TwitchyTeam If you ever have a few minutes, check out this article from the Pioneer Institute. James Milgram is a professor of math and sat on the #CommonCore validation committee. https://t.co/GkCCk7JSyk
@susanM7777 @QuinnforLD17 @sgstotsky @michellemalkin @StopCommonCoreG @michaelgendre @TwitchyTeam #CommonCore completely changed math and ELA into experiments where right answers are now wrong and these standards did nothing but bring stagnant test scores and declining academic achievement. Look @ Massachusetts. They were ranked among the top in the world pre-Common Core.
@shelly2161 @jane_jrobbins Pushing for hormone therapy and adolescent sex-reassignment surgery is child abuse. If parents allow children to make the rules, it will end in disaster. Young brains are not fully developed &amp; it's our job as parents to provide guidance against unhealthy, risky decisions.
@susanM7777 @QuinnforLD17 @sgstotsky @michellemalkin @StopCommonCoreG @michaelgendre @TwitchyTeam The tests students are given are aligned to the curriculum which has to be aligned to the standards. So yes, there is a direct connection to Common Core &amp; what is taught in the classroom, especially since schools are ranked by how well &amp; how many students take these tests. #ESSA
