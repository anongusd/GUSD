@angryseattle Climate change can’t exclusively be Jay’s issue, so I don’t see how he’s going to gain any momentum when there are far better candidates (Bernie) running who address climate change AND other issues.
I predicted Claire McCaskill’s loss (I thought it would be closer). The @MoDemParty, by embracing centrism, lost both Senate seats and the Governor’s office. I voted for Jo Crain, the Green nominee, in 2018. I’ll vote Green again in 2020 if they can’t get their shit together
What’s sad is, knowing Missouri, he’s probably going to win reelection with 50%+ of the vote in 5 years.

RT @marwilliamson: Even if they build a wall, in time we will tear it down. #lovewillprevail
By spreading hate we only create more hate. We can’t hate, no matter how much we want to sometimes. We need to spread peace and love and positivity
@chancetherapper Chance I’ve been struggling with my faith a lot lately. I need some really religious music from you. I need the Lord’s light in my life.

@JeffreyGuterman @realDonaldTrump We need to spread more love and positivity. We can’t associate Trump’s supporters with negativity because we’re just spreading more hate. Hate is dangerous.

@JeffreyGuterman @realDonaldTrump Jeffrey, we’re not going to get anywhere attacking the other side. We have to understand they’re human too. They just have different ideas and opinions than us. And that’s all any of us really have, ideas and opinions. We’re all human and we’re on this Earth together
@CentrumUSA @realDonaldTrump The Democrats would be all over that shit. Maybe throw in 5 billion for the Green New Deal and in return he gets his wall
@CentrumUSA @realDonaldTrump I don’t think he’ll get his stupid wall but if he were smart he’d bring up the solar panal wall again
@CentrumUSA @realDonaldTrump I think a good compromise wouldn’ve been a wall with solar panals, like he suggested last year I think
Other candidates who I’ve donated $10 to so far:	@TulsiGabbard	@VoteOjeda2020 (ironically the day before he dropped out)
Just donated $15 to @marwilliamson’s 2020 campaign and $10 to @AndrewYangVFA’s campaign. 2 candidates who I’m really hoping do well in the primaries if Bernie doesn’t run

@BryanJFischer And I’m not gonna take it from some millionaire televangelist that I’m wrong. I’ve had my own experiences with God. I’ve gone to church for 10+ years and understand the Bible probably as well as you.
@BryanJFischer The fact is, God loves everyone, whether you’re gay or not. Having faith in him is what’s important at the end of the day.
@BryanJFischer First of all, Pete Buttigieg is actually running for President. I’m surprised you didn’t attack him for being gay instead of someone you only suspect is gay. Second, why should his sexual orientation matter anyway? Didn’t God say you’re supposed to love everyone?
