@hardcorerox @joannalevine27 @GovInslee The only change to this day we should make is to make it Amerigo Vespucci Day. Let the indigenous peoples find another one of the 364 days we have to celebrate and stop going after our one day of celebration.
@richardlsoto @GovInslee I‚Äôm not joking. It just pisses me off that after all this time, the celebratory day for the Italian Culture is now becoming indigenous peoples day taking the one day we have to celebrate our heritage away from us. Let the indigenous peoples find another day to celebrate.

@DerekPells @joannalevine27 @GovInslee Lol bet
@marchand_82 @GovInslee I take this day more seriously. It‚Äôs not because I hate every other nationality. Indigenous peoples have 364 other days to pick to be their day of celebration. I just don‚Äôt like how they‚Äôre trying to steal our day.

@Shieldk2 It‚Äôs been an Italian holiday.
@marchand_82 @GovInslee We‚Äôre celebrating our Italian heritage and our rich history. What kind of question is that?
@marchand_82 @GovInslee Every nationality has its own day. Let the indigenous peoples find their own day and stop going after our celebratory day.
@marchand_82 @GovInslee Why am I a racist though for standing for my Italian heritage?
@joannalevine27 @GovInslee If we had to change the name of this day, let it be Amerigo Vespucci Day. We will not relinquish our day of celebration of our great heritage. Let the indigenous peoples find another day to celebrate.
@marchand_82 @GovInslee Wow, I can‚Äôt understand how it‚Äôs racism to stand for your native heritage, but if you want to go so low as to calling me a racist, by all means.
@GovInslee Wow, another anti-Italian joke
@aROSEthatGREW And if we are made to recognize it as indigenous peoples day, you should know that Italians are tougher than anybody that you‚Äôll ever see and we will push back and we will raise hell. This is our day and nobody else‚Äôs.
@aROSEthatGREW So you‚Äôre basically saying ‚Äúf*ck the Italians‚Äù. Realize that Italians will never EVER relinquish our day to any indigenous peoples. Pick another day for god sakes. The first Monday of October will always be ours. There are 364 other days you can pick out to celebrate.
@Pearce4NM It‚Äôs Columbus Day, the day of the Italian American. Indigenous peoples will never steal our day.
