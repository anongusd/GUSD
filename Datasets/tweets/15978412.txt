This is my first time coming across Mr. Chip Roy.
@voweler Speaking for myself, bc (a) Giuliani said it "could" have occurred on a later timeline, and (b) because Cohen's explanation at a minimum cuts against a timeline he's sticking with, and (c) he's in a position to know. So, y'know, journalists ask questions about things like that.
@sharonaly You‚Äôre right, though Giuliani put it in ‚Äòcould‚Äô terms. I‚Äôm questioning what the deal is with Cohen staying with that timeline despite an explanation that at a minimum complicates it.
"Why did the [Trump Tower Moscow] deal stop?"- DeSaunier		Cohen: "Because he won the presidency."		OK, if that's the case, then how is it the Trump Tower Moscow deal stopped in June 2016, as is the current timeline?
"I've never been to Prague. I've never been to the Czech Republic." 		So that remains Cohen's line(, re that aspect of the Steele Dossier).

It sounds like there's anti-BDS language in the antisemitism amendment passed 424-0 in into @RoKhanna's anti-Yemen war resolution. It says it's in the US interest to oppose "restrictive trade practices or boycotts," in-the-context-of-but-not-specifically Israel.

@therealyavuz It means that beyond the Syria withdrawal, a global war against an enemy that never gets defined is going to continue, indefinitely, and they're going to try to do so clandestinely whenever possible.
West, asked what the strategic thinking is that led to the Syria pullout &amp; how they'll continue to support the SDF (West said that), responds, "I do not know the strategic thinking that went into it." Guess the assistant secretary of defense for spec ops wasn't consulted either.

Votel, tacitly doing damage control on Trump's statement that US troops will stay in Iraq to 'watch' Iran: "we‚Äôre very focused on the reason the government of Iraq asked us to be there," meaning ISIS. Backstory, from @KimDozier: https://t.co/S4z07CrDFK
@SenTomCotton says he'd "observe" there's a lot of "empty bed space at Guantanamo Bay" for ISIS detainees currently held by the SDF.
Asked by Cotton, Votel describes fighting in Syria in "urban" location "laden with explosives" in a 20 sq-mile area ISIS holds in the southern Euphrates valley near the Iraqi border." Says proceeding as "expected" but forces, primarily Syrian proxies, "deliberately" proceeding.
Votel keeps saying that he'll tell Senators what's next or under consideration in Syria and Afghanistan in closed session.
Does Votel agree that with the US departure from Syria will come renewed ISIS "vigor," asks Reed? "I do agree," Votel says.
Votel wants to keep the US in the Yemen war. Departing would reduce US "leverage" on Saudi &amp; UAE, and "further endangers Americans in the region." 		This is the Yemen war: https://t.co/XBTT8apIuf
Details on the Syria withdrawal "are being developed now," Votel tells the Senate. He's trying to stress a "continuity" of effort against ISIS.

That era of MRR made punk less weird, less fun and less relevant. The best stuff came out of what MRR purged ‚Äî Punk Planet, HeartattaCk. (Someone commission @dansinker to eulogize MRR.) But lambasting MRR was inseparable from consuming it. That was its contribution to scene unity
MRR was a lesson in dogmatism. It was rigid yet ideologically amorphous ‚Äî this was the late Tim Yo years ‚Äî a kind of punk not clearly articulable but intuitive to grasp the longer you spent in punk. It‚Äôd purge people &amp; bands. Everyone paid attention; all punk zines reacted to MRR

I have to go catch a train so I'm going to miss the final vote on the resolution but my colleague @desiderioDC will have you covered On Here &amp; we'll have a full wrap piece when all is said &amp; done.
RT @desiderioDC: Todd Young‚Äôs amendment to the Yemen resolution (classifying refueling as part of the hostilities under the War Powers Reso‚Ä¶
Young‚Äôs amendment passes, 58-41. If the anti-Yemen-war resolution ultimately passes, it‚Äôs going to have big implications for legislative disavowal of military logistics &amp; security force assistance operations far beyond Yemen.
@wesleysmorgan I would suspect this could act as precedent for far more than just midair refueling, and that suspicion was strengthened by Corker and Young trying yesterday to put into the Senate record that they‚Äôre not trying to set a broader precedent beyond Yemen.
@wesleysmorgan And I‚Äôm not telling you anything you don‚Äôt know, but your example (and others) is why Mattis &amp; the Pentagon general counsel have been for a year arguing that the Yemen resolution commits a WPR category error &amp; Congress shd stay out of the way. Senate is now voting to rebuke that.
@wesleysmorgan Depends on if you consider clarification that US logistics/etc contributions to such operations a ‚Äúcomplication.‚Äù 		But yeah, importance of this is that SFA &amp;c comes more firmly under the prospect of legislative rejection after decades of presumed unilateral executive authority.
Todd Young's amendment to formally consider US refueling to qualify as part of hostilities for purposes of the War Powers Resolution (a big deal, for reasons a forthcoming piece of mine will get into) is up for a vote now, as voting on the antiwar Yemen resolution begins.
Menendez, ahead of the Yemen votes, says Saudi Arabia, by murdering Khashoggi, has joined a "sinister clique" of nations that assassinate critics, including Russia, North Korea &amp; Iran.

@desiderioDC Before I go, Young &amp; Corker are trying to get the Senate record to state that saying refueling = hostilities doesn't set a precedent beyond Yemen; though future senators are very likely to say that's exactly what it means for security force assistance.
Unfortunately, I'm going to go have to go get my kid, so I don't know how this amendment vote is going to turn out, and possibly not the final vote, depending on how long this goes. Make sure to follow my co-reporter on this one, @desiderioDC.
Young is going to introduce an amendment clarifying that the Senate holds refueling to constitute involvement in hostilities under the War Powers Resolution. If that passes, it might be even more important than this Yemen vote itself. Will explain why in my wrap piece on this.
60 votes for the Germane thing.

The big 5 telecoms are witting partners by 2006 (Company D was ‚Äúminimal‚Äù) by 2002. Firmly when Barr was at Verizon.
@emptywheel A year after, no?
@ptguy2001 Unlike you, I revealed the NSA draft inspector general's 2009 history of STELLAR WIND. You should read that and get back to me, particularly the section on the major telecommunications companies.
For more on the pivotal role US telecom companies play in surveillance, see this: https://t.co/O3se6dkuTR		NSA's inspector general once cited Keith Alexander saying "if the relationships w/these companies were ever terminated, the US SIGINT system would be irrevocably damaged."
William Barr was Verizon's general counsel from 2000-2008, which means he would have been a key NSA liaison during the warrantless STELLAR WIND mass-communications dragnets. There is zero evidence Verizon was anything but collaborative while Bush 43 violated the 4th amendment.

@blasky @nate_bowling @ddale8 I wrestled with that, but here you go: 		For Pakistan, Yemen &amp; Somalia in 2015 &amp; 2016, using the same @tbij* totals, Obama launched either 100 or 101 drone strikes.		*Not QUITE the same bc CENTCOM actually provided me a 2017-18 total for Yemen that was slightly higher than TBIJ.
Asfandyar's total would bring drone strikes under Trump for Yemen, Somalia &amp; Pakistan to 247.		Since the US doesn't break down air strikes in Iraq, Syria &amp; Afgh by manned/unmanned platform, figuring out the drone total there ‚Äì where the air wars are *way* up ‚Äì is a harder task.
As everyone who's attempted tallying the strikes knows, monitoring drone strikes is an imprecise endeavor. My count for Pakistan (&amp; Somalia) strikes comes from @TBIJ, which does great work. Stanford's Asfandyar Ali Mir counts *15 strikes* in Pakistan under Trump, vice TBIJ's 6.
First two years of Obama: 186 drone strikes in Yemen, Somalia and Pakistan. 		First two years of Trump: 238 drone strikes in Yemen, Somalia and Pakistan. 		And a lot of pattern breakdowns for 2018-era Drone Strikes below those toplines. 		https://t.co/ULReIcfrxV

Another noteworthy thing: Obama relaxed his own drone rules under something he called the PPG to provide for a truly stunning level of 2016 strikes on Libya during a campaign to take Sirte from ISIS. Considered it a Real War ‚Äî never declared ‚Äî where the Drone Rules didn‚Äôt apply.
There are a lot of other revealing statistics in here ‚Äî drone strikes in the Official Wars of Iraq, Syria &amp; Afghanistan appears to have held steady from the end of Obama‚Äôs term ‚Äî but the part about Somalia being the shadow-war epicenter of Drones 2018 is particularly noteworthy.

I don't think (but could be misremembering) that we knew this about Abu Zubaydah's torture: "At the planned point of peak interrogational intensity, waterboard applications would be alternated with use of the confinement boxes (in which he would 'contemplate his situation')"
As far as I know, the last person sacked &amp; escorted off White House grounds was this CIA liaison: https://t.co/jIqMSbLzYX
@mtar925 @ACLU That's not the relevant aspect of the human experimentation. That's the rest of the document. Not the eye thing. No one is asserting the eye thing is human experimentation.
@ACLU (And just to end this on a... happier note (?), I wrote that story from the hospital the days after my daughter was born. It's a story I look forward to sharing with her one day)
@ACLU Here's the document, which has a *lot* more than this detail I've seized upon: https://t.co/6rLkt1foP7		We knew CIA had cleared the way for human experimentation thanks to an earlier ACLU-acquired document that I published in 2015: https://t.co/qI2utgECiT
@ACLU But there's a difference of opinion amongst eye specialists during an important moment about what to do about Abu Zubaydah's left eye, which he eventually loses. We don't know from this when he loses the eye. But now we know extraction is under consideration in April 2002.
@ACLU Now, I don't know if that means the left eye is considered a lost cause from jump, and that the "atrophy w/o further complication" means complication to *the right eye* or what. The document isn't clear. But at some point between 2002 and 2006, Abu Zubaydah loses the eye.
@ACLU But CIA's Office of Medical Support doesn't do that. Instead, they consult with "Washington-area specialists" ‚Äì some 7000+ miles away! ‚Äì who urge a course of antibiotics instead. That seems to get rid of the inflammation &amp; the left orbit "atrophied w/o further complication."
@ACLU So this, from CIA, says that Abu Zubaydah's left eye had an interior inflammation (endophthalmitis), allegedly pre-agency custody. An opthalmologist at the Thailand black site recommends "urgent enucleation" ‚Äì meaning, remove the eye; it threatens his *right* eye, too.
I'm going to tweetstorm about what happened to CIA detainee Abu Zubaydah's missing left eye, a post-9/11 torture mystery, because this snippet from a human-experimentation document that @ACLU got declassified has new information. (but not a definitive answer) https://t.co/twbODhYeB3

Tomorrow the rain will wash their mingled blood 	Into the runners, and it will be lost 	In rubbish heap, in stagnant pool, in mud. 	Its cry will not be heard. 	It will descend into the deep, or water the cockle-burr. 	And all things will be as they ever were.
ARISE and go now to the city of slaughter; 	Into its courtyard wind thy way; 	There with thine own hand touch, and with the eyes of 	 thine head, 	Behold on tree, on stone, on fence, on mural clay, 	The spattered blood and dried brains of the dead.

@The_M_to_the_C @maggieNYT @thedailybeast Even accepting for sake of argument the accuracy of this Mail story, this is about rival Saudi royals &amp; business figures MBS imprisoned last fall in his power grab. Khashoggi is most certainly not in that cohort.

That's a wrap on Haspel's first public speech as CIA director.
Haspel getting asked tough questions here. What's the last movie she saw? (Red Sparrow) Desert island Johnny Cash songs? (Ring of Fire &amp; I Walk The Line, though she was offered limited choices) Fave KY bourbon? (Woodford Reserve)
Asked about Iran, Haspel rattles off parade of regime horribles, supporting Assad, "maintaining a gov't in Baghdad beholden to Tehran," Yemen, economic mismanagement. Criticizes Houthis for attacks on "our allies, Saudi &amp; the Emirates"; no criticism re their devastation of Yemen.
on North Korea, Haspel doesn't really give an intelligence perspective. Says Kim "stated he‚Äôs interested in denuclearizing his country," though Kim has called for the denuclearization *of the peninsula,* a reference to the US nuclear umbrella over South Korea.
Morale at CIA: "We tend not to pay attention to the fray in the capitol. ... Morale tends to be pretty constant."
Haspel says she is "several times a week part of the briefing team" at the White House to present the presidential daily brief to President Trump.
After relating an anecdote about climbing Mt. Kilimanjaro, Haspel tells students: "Raise your hand when the hard jobs come to you. That alone will take you most of the way to the top.‚Äù
Haspel talking up all the layers of oversight over CIA, "what makes us accountable to the open society we serve. It's what makes us an American intelligence agency." She stonewalled her Senate confirmation hearing over her involvement in torture. https://t.co/RGRjJq4nuO
@SenateMajLdr Other priorities include ‚Äúsharpening our focus on nation-states adversaries," and increasing the number of officers stationed overseas. "Building stronger relationships with foreign counterparts... CIA is working more closely than ever" with them. (Something all directors say.)
@SenateMajLdr Haspel: "it should come as no surprise one of my top priorities since becoming director has been to champion diversity‚Äù at @CIA.
@SenateMajLdr Haspel remarking on the differences between actual spycraft and Hollywood portrayals of it. Even though CIA cultivates those portrayals https://t.co/t7nLdlHPrC

@SecPompeo's position here boils down to: don't listen to Trump's words, listen to particular actions (some of which, like sanctions on Russia, Trump came to kicking &amp; screaming) and substitute my language for Trump's.
@richardclarke In all fairness to NSA, the period the inspector general reviewed was before Gen. Nakasone took command.
Corker is saying Trump "purposefully" misconstrues NATO  to sow doubt amongst Americans in the alliance.
Asked why Pompeo uses "final fully verified denuclearization" instead of "complete verifiable irreversible denuclearization," he answers, "Sometimes one needs to break away" and says they mean the same thing.
Rand Paul says there's been a "gnashing of teeth" about Trump "meeting with Vladimir Putin," even though every single aspect of criticism has been about Trump meeting with Putin alone &amp; Trump's supine behavior afterward.
Pompeo smiles at himself a lot.
Pompeo later says, when asked specifically if the North Koreans have made an "inventory" of their nuke infrastructure, "I can‚Äôt answer that here."
Pompeo says no agreement on arms-control accords (INF, New START) with Russia reached at Helsinki.
Pompeo takes a very long road to confirm that North Korea has made no declaration of its nuclear infrastructure.
@SecPompeo sticking to what is clearly a talking point about Trump's private meeting with Putin. ‚ÄúI know you‚Äôve had private conversations in your life and you valued them.‚Äù	@JeffFlake shows Pompeo his belly and moves on to North Korea.
This hearing is already contentious. Pompeo dodging whatever it is Putin &amp; Trump discussed &amp; pivots to talking about "US policy... I understand, senator, the game you're playing."
Pompeo, clearly trying to shoot down press report, says of Trump &amp; North Korea that Trump "remains upbeat...progress is happening." Continues using the vague term "final fully verified denuclearization."
Trump is "antagonizing our friends and placating those who clearly wish us ill," says Corker.
Corker to Pompeo (quotes not checked against my tape &amp; I'm typing fast): provide us with clear answers that might help convince us that those at the White House know what they are doing and candidly, that you know what they are doing.

That sound, restlessness teetering on the edge of  an anxiety attack, is a pitilessly accurate depiction of what journalism‚Äôs collective internal monologue sounds like.
@BalkansBohemia I‚Äôm afraid to look at my shit from back then &amp; probablyyyyyy justifiably
@NoahShachtman True story: I was on the cover of the issue of NY Press that was in the boxes on 9/11. It had come out the Wednesday before.
@NoahShachtman At least we can explain to our kids exactly why J Jonah Jameson is bad and Perry White is good.
RIP NY Press too. I remain grateful I got to be there for a very small part of that. I straight-up worshipped that paper like it was Born Against, something that I didn‚Äôt realize was my ideal version of the sort of thing it was.
I can‚Äôt believe I‚Äôm going to raise a 4th-generation New Yorker and I‚Äôm going to have to explain to her what a newspaper culture was &amp; what it meant for the city.

@ClaraJeffery @BuzzFeedBen @NoahShachtman Lord Of The Rings is a Middle Earth notebook dump. The Silmarillion has music in it! It was basically Tolkien‚Äôs SoundCloud
@ClaraJeffery @BuzzFeedBen @NoahShachtman Ben is distracting from how wrong he is
@nerdette I can vouch for the Edward/Piers Galveston stuff. I read Dan Jones‚Äô book The Plantagenets &amp; really enjoyed it
@BuzzFeedBen @NoahShachtman You‚Äôre wrong there. Fellowship is overstuffed *because* he‚Äôs breaking news all over the place about the language, history, topography &amp; differences within/amongst Middle Earth. Tolkien is such a pure reporter that the overall narrative suffers ‚Äîbut is built impressionistically.
