@cudak888 @WLRN @GreenMobilityFL @TransitMIA @MiamiBikeScene @VictorDover @theunderlinemia @stevenjwernick @ECGreenway @FlaCyclingLaw @MRC_SLC @MobilityLabTeam One comment among many. Taken out of context in which I focused on greater protection from law enforcement and education of motorists. Trying to create greater public awareness over the year by collaborating across the silos.
The result unfortunately is that the @MiamiDadeBCC voted to accept inadequate protections for our future water supply. I will press for increased water clean up and production in the final agreements. #waterwarrior https://t.co/d4omWZGIX7
I was told that prior chairs “bent the rules”! I’m for that, rather than disenfranchisement. We are fortunate citizens care enough to show up. #ShineTheLight https://t.co/40mwg3LQdy
Right. “Induced demand” works for roads AND transit. People will use what works best. We need to offer great transit to make it work. Cutting service undermines our goals. We can’t starve the system we are trying to build. https://t.co/b9Wmq1ryo0
@MetrorailF @IRideMDT I passed changes to the fee for transit so that buses within the County cannot charge more than the Metrorail fare.  That means the express route 34B cost the same as the old 38 and goes straight to 152 street now during rush hour.  Give it a try.
@John_Gamble20 @mbmerwitzer @IRideMDT @MetrorailTales @eugeneflinn I’m advocating for Metrorail south but I’ve always warned that it is probably 8-10 years before the first new line.  Adding additional capacity at our overcroweded Park &amp; Rides helps now, and is critical to building the ridership needed to justify extending Metrorail south.
I suggested virtual input but it’s up to the chair. Do call and write commissioners in advance. That does help. Especially when many weigh in. I post highlights of every Commission meeting in advance but monitoring the committee agendas is best. You may sign up to receive notice. https://t.co/D1w4PFlVg0
