@gridlockjoe in this case the charges will be made immediately bcz America is living on money borrowed from our children. I am tired of it.
@BrianDunn1 we already have appointed conferees - if you believe P Obama that's your right - just try that theory yourself first
@anths no business and no family in America can survive if they try to solve income/spending problem by borrowing more money - it'sillogical
@gridlockjoe raising the debt ceiling increases the national debt - it is not complicated
@anths common sense tells you do not spend money you do not have - it's not complicated
@BrianDunn1 Brian the debt ceiling must be raised bcz America is living on money borrowed from our children - spending problem must b solved
@anths call Dave Ramsey's financial radio show and tell him what you just told me
@gridlockjoe so if you had an overspending problem you would solve it by raising your credit card limits &amp; borrowing more money?
@anths ok so if you had an overspending problem you would solve it by borrowing more money? Ask your bank if they agree.
@BrianDunn1- ok so if you had an overspending problem you would solve it by borrowing more money?
@JuxVP you got it exactly right! Thank you!  No one in America would solve their spending prob by raising credit card limits
@Texas56 thank you! It was fun - I am amazed they gave me so much time
Forget politics: using common sense &amp; logic, do you believe P Obama when he just said raising the debt ceiling does not increase our debt?
So how many of you believe P Obama when he says increasing America's debt limit does not increase America's debt?

@speechboy71 looks like it
@speechboy71 thanks for the thoughtful polite discussion - I always enjoy an intelligent polite debate - have a great evening
@speechboy71 again human nature combined w the usual liberal elitism
If Obamacare is so wonderful it's good enough for Congress and all the staffers who wrote it but the liberal elitists  exempted themselves
@speechboy71 of course they do! It's human nature! If you could exempt your wife and kids from Obamacare would you? They did
@speechboy71 they chose to exempt themselves - there is no excuse - everyone outside the room got stuck &amp; they are exempt - not complicated
It's human nature. they're in a locked room writing the bill - they could subject themselves &amp; families to Obamacare or exempt themselves
@speechboy71 my staff is nailing that down for you as well
@speechboy71 no matter who first wrote it the final choice was made by Dem leaders and Dem comm staff- they chose to exempt themselves -
@speechboy71 Dem comm staff lawyers had two choices: use Lang that includes them or excludes them - they chose to exclude themselves
@speechboy71 they choose to include the language that exempts themselves in the final version; this is evident in the timeline we sent you
@speechboy71 majority staff lawyers for conf comm are responsible for drafting final conf report, they are Ds who work for Pelosi &amp; Reid so
@speechboy71 Coburn passed first, app only to Cong &amp; personal staff; then Grassley passed applied to everyone; goes to conf comm then
@speechboy71 it looks like my memory was correct - not trying to be right just accurate - what is your impression of seq of events?
@speechboy71 did you get the timeline w links from my press sec Stephen Worley? It proves that what I told you was true
@speechboy71
@speechboy71 thank you. It exempts committee staff and I strongly suspect it was written by comm staff bcz that is SOP when u offer comm amd
@speechboy71 Congressmen and their personal staff are the only people in America required to buy our insurance from Obamacare exchanges
And no the comm staff exemption did not come from Coburn:his amendment put ALL staff and ALL Congress in exchanges - comm lawyers changed it
@speechboy71 you misunderstand what I am trying to say / hard to do in a tweet
@speechboy71 why don't you call me at the office tomorrow once my staff has all the documentation? (202) 225-2571
@incognito912 good advice! Ty!
@repjustinamash she has zero followers and is from Kazakstan - ouch
@incognito912 good idea - I also boot them if they curse
@repjustinamash thanks Justin - I am always suspicious and expect malware
@Teresiailf4 what is this before I click on it?
What?
Tomorrow I asked my staff to go to Senate comm clerk and get actual language to prove what we have been told- I will share what I find
Coburn text applied to all Congressmen and ALL staff:in the final bill this lang changed magically to apply to all Congress &amp; personal staff
My expert legis director tells me she learned that Coburns language magically changed brw the time it was adopted to final bill
My staff thinks these amendments were done in committee - we will get exact copies &amp; the vote
Then Coburn offered amend to require Congress and ALL staff to buy insurance from exchange - his amendment passed
Grassley offered amend req Pres &amp; Cabinet &amp; all fed employees &amp; Congress &amp; ALL staff to buy their insurance from exchange - amend failed
Ok Michael I figured it out - this will take several tweets to explain and I will document chapter and verse tomorrow -
Do you see how this works? Only A &amp; B are required to do X, so by law, everyone else is exempt from this requirement. Standard legal process
only Members of Congress and our personal staff are required to buy our insurance from the exchanges - for everyone else it's optional
@speechboy71 true it was Coburn but he did not write it personally - standard procedure for us is to ask comm lawyers to draft amendment
Therefore rem key legal concept: if a definition specifically includes a group, it excludes all others not mentioned
Michael I am a lawyer by training which helps me untangle the incomprehensible laws the professional staff lawyers in Congress write
@AllenLewis sorry it's all on Twitter - try Hootsuite app and link conversation
@haroldpollack no worries - thank you
I have authored many amendments &amp;usually write my own but I am unusual - most common to ask drafting attorney write it which Coburn prob did
yes and professional comm staff rewrote it as they always do as good lawyers for consistency etc &amp; here to be sure they exempted themselves
@claymonster sorry Clay - my tweets are posted simul on Facebook - I am proving to liberal skeptics that Obama is exempt from Obamacare
@haroldpollack http://t.co/RFSXF7Vkoz
@speechboy71 http://t.co/RFSXF7Vkoz
@speechboy71 my staff is sending me the URL on Obama now but I have a fresh plate of Texas BBQ brisket waiting for me - I will be back
@haroldpollack all committee staff are exempt from Obamacare and since it was written by Democrat comm staffers they exempted themselves
@haroldpollack what have I misstated?
I have served on many conference committees - the way it works I offer an amend and comm staff rewrite it to be consistent w rest of bill
@speechboy71 if they wanted to include themselves they just say "all cong staff"
@speechboy71 yes of course the Dem comm staffers knew exactly what they were doing
@speechboy71 no - suggested by a Repub and whatever language he offered was rewritten by Dem maj comm staff
@speechboy71 the conference comm staff that wrote the final conference report - that staff is hired by the majority which was Pelosi &amp; Reid
@speechboy71 Grassley or Coburn is irrelevant - the final language on any conference report is always written by the majority comm staff
No problem - stand by
@speechboy71 that's next stand by
@speechboy71 I said committee staff is exempt - it was written in secret by Pelosi/Reid comm staff and therefore exempts comm staff
So you have more room and more freedom to print truth. My constituents &amp; I are keenly interested to see if you will print the truth here.
@speechboy71 therefore Pelosi/Reid comm staffers who were behind the locked door writing the bill deliberately excluded themselves.
@speechboy71 check my most recent message to you / the section applying Obamacare to "Congress &amp; personal staff" which excludes comm staff
I am standing by for you to show me where I have said anything inaccurate. You are a reporter for The Guardian so truth is import to you.
Members of Congress &amp; personal staff are stuck w Obamacare like everyone else &amp; thrown into nonexistent exchanges: http://t.co/jpriUq17CS
Obamacare applies it to Cong &amp; pers staff: comm staff r exempt bcz they r omitted from staff definition: http://t.co/WTGJMNa7me
@speechboy71 how is it untrue? Dem comm staff wrote the exemption, and exempted all comm staff, obviously including themselves and Rs
@speechboy71 I will send you that citation as well - stand by - I am calling my staff now to send me the links as tiny urls
@speechboy71 Democrat committee staff who wrote the bill in secret exempted themselves, so all comm staff, D &amp; R, are exempt
@jstogdill I have been asked for my drivers license repeatedly when I vote / no big deal.

@tyrellaagard no check the record I voted against the new Medicare prescription drug coverage
@speechboy71 now this is a thoughtful interesting debate on the facts! I enjoy this
@speechboy71 thank you! Well done! Note the statute refers to staff in personal office - that definition excludes comm staff who are exempt
@theosmelek that's intelligent rational conversation - goodbye!
@chip_pringle me too. Good night all!
@DeeinColumbiaMD who just injected race into this conversation? Goodbye
@speechboy71 I think Senator Grassley asked for an amend to apply Obamacare to Congress - Dem comm staff obliged &amp; then exempted themselves
@chip_pringle polite fair debate is always good
@SOMAMadman thanks - it is shocking - I will post a tiny URL link to the bill section exempting the staff who wrote it and Obama et al
@speechboy71 I already know w certainty bcz I read the bill before I voted no - it exempts the committee staff who wrote it and Obama et al
@SOMAMadman read the bill. I did,
@chip_pringle ty
When my staff is in the office tomorrow I will post tiny URL links to prove everything I have posted - thanks for being politely skeptical
@ONowland bye bye - cursing is unacceptable
@TexasAlum I voted against virtually every major new program and every new spending initiative Bush proposed including No Child Left Behind
Asking for a valid govt ID is common sense unless you want fraudulent voters to steal an election -
@DeeinColumbiaMD I never mentioned cost - I have no idea what will happen to my family and me bcz I go into exchanges that dont exist Jan I
@SOMAMadman if you are so knowledgeable prove what you say is true
the federal budget/ fed reserve  creating money from thin air to buy debt is  history's largest Ponzi scheme - urgent we balance the budget!
@haroldpollack I will ask my legis director to post the direct link to Obamacare section that exempts committee staff who wrote the bill
@speechboy71 look up the definition of congressional coverage underObamacare
@JimmyIIX plz explain - I am intrigued
@SOMAMadman I go into the exchanges Jan 1 - exchanges do not exist and are not likely anytime soon - therefore I expect my ins will be toast
@chip_pringle spectacular
@chip_pringle ok that makes sense
@JimmyIIX please explain
@globalcitizenln no other President ever tried to nationalize health care for all Americans - if it's so great why did he exempt himself?
@DeeinColumbiaMD what have I said tonight that is false?
@JimmyIIX that's the State of Texas CAFR - I am federal and buried alive keeping up w the Feds- why don't you tell me about Tx CAFR?
@JimmyIIX I am snowed under trying to cut federal spending &amp; repeal/replace Obamacare, rein in NSA etc - plz tell what bothers you in CAFR?
@DeeinColumbiaMD that really makes sense - you are confused
@AbeSilberstein look it up Abe - it's true
@TexasAlum that would be time well spent!
@AbeSilberstein  ?
@DeeinColumbiaMD you are confused
@speechboy71 that is it in a nutshell - that's all you need to know about Obamacare!
@JimmyIIX Texas' budget is balanced - what's your concern?
@JimmyIIX got it
@JimmyIIX what is CAFR?
@TexasAlum that makes sense - I am redesigning my web page now and will do that - its a good idea
@DeeinColumbiaMD what did I say that is false?
@JimmyIIX what are CAFRs and what is $115 trillion represent?
@TexasAlum do you mean a column that shows my paycheck, deductions, insurance, taxes etc etc? Im happy to do it
@KeithCowing thanks - I just won't publish my personal info - I have already had my identity stolen! Once is enough!
@cynicusprime no with whoever wants to ask me a question
@joeuelk he did a real service to expose the depth and breadth of gov't potential to spy on Americans but he helped our enemies too
@KeithCowing it's the same split that every major employer does - my coverage is toast on Jan 1 like everyone else's
Sure - I will call my staff tomorrow and have them scan in my coverage - without my social security numbers, policy number etc -
@joeuelk both
@chip_pringle literally if you were inside the locked room writing Obamacare you are exempt; all of us locked out are stuck with it
No the only people who are exempt are Obama, Biden, Cabinet officers and the Pelosi/Reid committee staff who wrote Obamacare in secret
It is outrageous. Voter ID is vital to ensure that only American citizens are voting. I just filed a bill to make sure that happens.
@TexasAlum bingo
@JimmyIIX What?
I am not sure how that works - I had $250 in the bank at the end of last month and a daughter going to college in two years.
@TexasAlum I completely agree- seal the border -create a Basero type work program so workers can travel freely but no welfare or citizenship
that is false-like I said I would be happy to publish my blue cross paperwork - my insurance goes up in flames Jan 1 like everyone else's
Actually we have already defunded parts of Obamacare but press won't cover it - current Fin Services Approps bill defunds individ mandate
@KeithCowing Not true - I would be glad to show you my paperwork
@KeithCowing I have Blue Cross just like Exxon/ConocoPhillips/etc &amp; same contribution ratio - until Jan 1 when I lose it like everyone else
All you need to know about Obamacare is that the liberals who wrote it in secret exempted themselves - case closed.
In other words, the liberals behind the locked door who wrote Obamacare exempted themselves &amp; made it apply to all of us who were locked out
The only people exempt from Obamacare are: Obama, Biden, cabinet officers and the committee lawyers who wrote the bill in total secrecy.
Of course my R colleagues &amp; I fought it tooth &amp; nail &amp; vote to repeal &amp; replace it every week - Congress and our staff are under Obamacare
Obamacare was written in secrecy &amp; rammed through so fast no one could read it so the people behind the locked door who wrote it are exempt

The NSA etc need to stay focused on foreign nationals overseas &amp; leave law abiding Americans alone.
I completely agree w you - I am working now on amendments to Patriot Act &amp; NSA program this fall to focus their work as intended overseas
@afarnham we can actually amend the Patriot Act &amp; NSA program this fall in a separate bill - today was funding only
we could not amend the NSA program today:only choice block funding for A or B - Pompeo was better drafted  http://t.co/rAD1A75KeJ
@JulianeBertagne my day is incomplete unless I have voted to cut spending somewhere somehow! House has now cut spending back to 2008 levels
@gridlockjoe We will rewrite NSA prog &amp; Patriot Act this fall - today only choice defund A or B - Pompeo was better  http://t.co/rAD1A75KeJ
@cboyack this fall the House will rewrite the NSA program &amp; Patriot Act - today only choice was defund A or B - Pompeo did a better job
@Milehimama this fall we will actually get to rewrite details of Patriot Act &amp; NSA program - today all we could do was defund A or B
@Milehimama yes Pompeo amend was drafted better than Amash  - http://t.co/rAD1A75KeJ
Today the only vote choices were to cut A or B  Pompeo was drafted far better than Amash to protect Amer privacy  http://t.co/rAD1A75KeJ

@jstogdill thanks for the thoughtful debate - good night!
@jstogdill I rely on final appeals court decisions as getting as close to the truth as is humanly possible, in virtually all cases.
@jstogdill S Ct has ruled "no interference" in every voter ID case; anyone can get an ID easily; it's simple: only legal voters should vote
@jstogdill In every case US Sup Ct has upheld voter ID laws bcz the Ct cannot find any evidence right to vote is impaired; IDs r EASY to get
@jstogdill where? When? How?
@jstogdill Repealing Dodd/Frank &amp; Obamacare is a great start
@jstogdill I appreciate your thoughtful &amp; polite debate: but those worries r not realistic in 21st C; equal protect/due process r guaranteed
@jstogdill not unfettered; less restrained by absurdly complex &amp; incomprehensible laws like Dodd/Frank &amp; Obamacare - both must b repealed
@jstogdill I have a very relevant Jeffersonian fear of an omnipotent unrestrained federal govt which we now have; temporarily I hope!
@jstogdill Where and when in the 21st Century have fed courts determined that State laws have violated Indiv liberty? I am unaware of it
@jstogdill I don't recall advocating obstructionism; I always work w anyone to create realistic solutions to prevent looming Nat bankruptcy
@jstogdill no one advocates unfettered big business; obv some reg needed but it should b minimum necess to protect consumers or environment
@therevdoctor this is defining diff btw the candidates/parties in 2012: Govt redistrib of wealth vs  free market creation of Indiv wealth
@jstogdill that's ancient history irrelevant in 21st Century America
@paulbtucker anti market bcz once again the govt is distorting market forces w a tax in this case
@paulbtucker at its core carbon trading is a redistributive tax bcz carbon "polluters" can keep emitting if they pay the govt more $$$
@chip_pringle My goal is to restore the 10th Amend bcz it will shrink the fed govt &amp; shift real power back to States &amp; restore indiv liberty
@TerryH8 I have always worked to find common solutions but they must be genuine realistic answers that prevent our looming nat bankruptcy
@Samesty84 go to Paul Ryan's website/my website/House Repub Budget Comm website; very specific realistic solutions to prevent nat bankruptcy
@paulbtucker private entities cannot compete &amp; survive against gov't controlled/dominated/subsidized options/solutions like Obamacare
@chip_pringle I am one of the House conservatives who are determined to truly cut spending, cut taxes &amp; restore the 10th Amendment &amp; liberty
@jstogdill we do not look to the government or redistributed wealth for solutions; we look to individual initiative &amp; truly free markets
@jpippert Not House conservatives; we are Constitutional conservatives determined to cut spending, cut taxes &amp; restore the 10th Amendment
RT @Obscura: @johnculberson If he redistributes enough, everyone will be poor.
@Heeb265 there is tremendous detail in Paul Ryan's realistic solutions to save Medicare &amp; Soc Sec from certain bankruptcy &amp; balance budget
@paulbtucker U r right Paul! Replace Obamacare w free market reforms: shop nationwide for policies &amp; pool indiv/small biz to get lower rates
Where are Obama's specific solutions? There is nothing new in his speech; very disappointing he offers nothing to prevent looming bankruptcy
RT @DickMorrisTweet: #DNC2012  His bump wil be limited because it is just emotional not long lasting.
Every goalevery solution Obama offers comes from gov't &amp; by redistributing hard earned tax dollars; we'll give you more free stuff than them
Obama liberals ignore our looming national bankruptcy &amp; offer nothing beyond more spending &amp; more taxes
Obama is the antithesis of Reagan who understood gov't IS the problem
Note the liberal mindset: "spending money on a tax cut" takes money away from the gov't; They believe all our money belongs to the fed gov't
Obama brags that he killed Osama bin Laden but he didn't do (build) that - the Navy SEALs &amp; the CIA &amp; our magnificent military did that!

I am going to try Twitter again to see if I can filter out trolls & spam & focus on friends & respectful, thoughtful opponents.

@worstrootcanale Ugh! this is a new one I am unfamiliar with - sounds awful - wouldn't state dental boards handle this under 10th Amend?

@JLVernonPhD that's why he used lower case, as I did in quoting him.
@JosephTX partly cloudly cool - wonderful!
I posted that too fast - Jefferson said on ANY problem "if you apply republican principles the knot will untie itself."
Jefferson often said that what the problem was, if you "apply republican principles (i.e. follow the Constit) the knot will untie itself."
On my way to Monticello to meet w fellow conserv to coord plan to restore 10th Amend indiv freedom/state sovereignty as Jefferson intended
My best wishes to you and your family for a happy, healthy and prosperous 2010!

@jeffw171 America urgently needs a true fiscal conservative majority in Congress dedicated to strict adherence to the Constitution
@DBranch44 please read the Daily Telegraph story
@notABBY his article is right on target - we need to use the same rules as Israel on ports of entry & our borders
@maryb1161 please read the Daily Telegraph article - it is accurate - how can you not be upset?
@zenpundit I will - good suggestion -thanks
@paulvalach thank you Paul...I hope you & your family have a healthy happy & prosperous 2010!

@evan7257 I did not have room to say former speaker - but I did on my Facebook post
@jeffw171 - I agree which is why I voted against over $2.6 trillion in Bush spending proposals - Note I said we need a CONSERVATIVE majority
Speaker Ginrich is right on target in his article, but only a conserv maj in Congress will do what must be done: http://tinyurl.com/yff42od

@davidhust I have had more people recommend Tweetie than Tweetdeck but will try them both
@AjntB2Sli I agree - plus while we are at it, let's also zero out the czars!
Be careful driving in the snow! Better yet on Saturday stay home & watch the great college football games on all day long - championships!
@mccoma I thought you were pulling my leg! thanks
Laundry is finished so I am off to read my Sam Houston biography & sleep - Good night all!
@paulvalach Could be someone messing with me but it looked like a mass spammer account just opened tonight - its gone already - interesting
@buszero They will load it up with everything they can - massive new federal spending programs - waste & debt we & our kids cannot afford
I am going to try Tweetdeck first & also download Tweetie to compare them - thanks for the advice - I am still figuring out my 3Gs iPhone
Fascinating - garbage tweets are already gone! Twitter must be able to auto ID garbage spammer tweets & erased their existence! TY Twitter!
@paulvalach We are about to get snow! This is epic for Houston & dangerous driving so I will watch the great football games on Saturday
@msbeeee both very worthwhile endeavors!
@msbeeee America doesn't have much time - we MUST have a full scale conservative revolution in 2010 & take back Congress & fire Pelosi!
@sedgewick the community will crush them with crowdstrength!
@msbeeee will do - morons!
@meontwit_ter2 got it
@meontwit_ter2 will do - thank you!
@sedgewick right - of course - I was so mad I forgot for a moment - will block immediately - thanks!

@Karoli The Germans captured on Long Island & Florida in 1942 were sent here to kill Americans; Sup Ct said military tribunal was proper
@Karoli The Germans captured in Florida & Long Island in June 1942 were sent here to kill Americans; Sup Ct said military tribunal wasproper
@Tosfm Anyone who violated US policy on interrog has already been disciplined - our CIA interrogators at Guantanamo deserve our thanks!
@Tosfm Foreigners fighting American soldiers or killing American citizens captured overseas have NEVER been given Constit rights until Obama
@Tosfm Enemy soldiers/foreign terrorists have always been tried in military courts bcz they are not entitled to our Constitutional rights.
@poopaltar Of course you can also just talk to me here - emails to list will be sent out no more than once a week but I am here regularly
@treetracker Sorry you haven't researched me thoroughly - I am trying to identify all unauthorized czars and will work to defund all of them
@VenerAbility Note I followed you automatically when you followed me
@ToddEpp I agree - although in some cases a formal declaration of war is not possible - such as the War on Terrorists  -
@Tosfm I think the last time Congress declared war was 1941 - since Korea/Vietnam the established procedure is to "authorize use of force"
@Admore I did - thanks
@buszero I fixed it - thanks for the heads up
my account has been hacked - do not open any links from me today until I tell you it is fixed - thanks to those who warned me
@mptomei Wh House lists 12 Bushczars so I assume thats your best list; If they stillexist & are unauthorized I will help defund them: thanks
@Tosfm Congress passed & I voted for 2 resolutions "authorizing the use of force" for Afghan&Iraq 2001&2002 = military tribunal proper forum
My daughter & I helped a neighbor set up her Christmas tree tonight; We plan to get our tree up & decorated Sunday.  Good night all!
Back later: I am off to help a neighbor trim her Christmas tree
@mptomei  If you send me an accurate list of 47 or 4 Bush Czars that were illegal (not auth by law) I will be sure we defund them too
@mojosd I object to a foreign soldier being given OUR Constit rights, lawyering up at our expense & going free on technicalities etc
@Karoli We agree: therefore KSM et al captured overseas have NO Constit rights & cannot lawyer up & be tried in a US Criminal Court
@TravisSheive I object to a foreign soldier being given OUR Constit rights, lawyering up at our expense & going free on technicalities etc
@TravisSheive No I am worried about our soldiers who will hesitate for fear of violating the enemies' Constit rights & chain of evidence etc
@mptomei Diff is Obama has created dozens with real power to control tens of billions of $$ & jobs & payroll etc = illegal & uprecedented
@mptomei Please send me the list of 47 Bush Czars: I know he had a couple but none w real power & I recall only a couple of minor ones
@mojosd Imagine your son is a Marine in Afgan: Now think: why has America NEVER given enemy foreign soldiers Constit rights?
@Karoli You haven't answered: why has American law NEVER given Constit rights to enemy foreign soldiers? Imagine your son is a Marine...
@jryanlaw Do your homework: my website & Rep Study Comm website lists all the alternatives we conservatives have offered on all major issues
@buszero I think I am set up to auto post everywhere whenever I post anywhere but I will doublecheck - thanks
@jstogdill Think about it: Why has America NEVER given Constitutional rights to enemy foreign soldiers captured on foreign battlefields?
@Karoli Think about it: why has America NEVER given U.S. Constitutional rights to foreign enemy soldiers captured on battlefields overseas?
@buszero Thank you!  I have been on Facebook more than Twitter recently but will do my best to be here regularly. Thanks for the RT
@mojosd Giving full Constitutional rights to terrorists/enemy soldiers captured overseas  &  http://tinyurl.com/yctjokj doesn't bother you?
We must also stop Obama from giving Constit rights to terrorists/enemy soldiers: they'll lawyer up atour expense & go free on techicalities!

@astrosgirlkel Employer could keep paying more or drop coverage, pay 8% yearly penalty & let employees go on national plan; most will drop
@MistyKhan No - I am not endorsing anyuone in the mayor's race
Friday Ways&Means Comm rebranded healthcarebill so that Senate can now pass the bill with a simple majority vote; Pelosi is full speed ahead
@notABBY Essential for Pres to rec. full funding NASA or it becomes almost impossible for friends in Congress to fully fund entire mission
@notABBY Best reason we must ignore this CBO analysis: "Chairman’s mark... has not yet been embodied in legislative language." (not a bill)
@goldsberry TY!
@astrosgirlkel Your employer can chose to keep paying growing health care premiums, or pay flat 8% & drop everyone into gov't plan. Hmmm...
@paulbtucker Sure - I held townhalls in Aug & will again this fall. Sign up for my eblasts & we will notify you.
@notABBY Btw I really like the background image on your Twitter page - I am a huge fan of Hubble/NASA & science in general
@paulbtucker We are in the minority so we cannot kill or stop the bill - whatever happens to it in the House is entirely up to Pelosi
@notABBY I haven't seen any CBO score that says any Pelosi/Obama/Reid health care care bill saves money in end- if u find 1 plz send me link
@evan7257 That is intended to allow them to compare risks nationwide so they can set proper premiums payments - logical but can be abused

@evan7257 1st debt/deficit/unfunded liability out of control, so HR 3200 is unaffordable, 2nd I am defending our private doctors
@NicoleBelle No priv co can compete w govt subsidized competitor& Pelosi bill will contain HR 3200 to drop allinto PO if priv policy changes
@maslowbeer Sure! Plz call Jamie at 202 225 2571 and she can set up appointment. I look forward to meeting you.
@NicoleBelle See www.culberson.house.gov and follow links under health care.  Pelosi/Obama/Reid have repeatedly committed to pass pub option
@evan7257 Fedsubsidy will make govt ins so much cheaper& biz can reduce payroll costs by dropping employee coverage & feds will absorb all
Final bill will b public option or Pelosi won't pass it.Fed gov't will absorb all:insurers can't compete & empl can't afford to keep cov
@paulbtucker Common sense: If feds decide when&how much to pay for which procedures, then feds control health care= feds run Tx Medical Ctr
@ErikVidor Common sense: If feds decide when&how much to pay for which procedures, then feds control health care= feds run Tx Medical Ctr
@paulbtucker Dist. 7 emails, phone calls faxes etc running 76% no, 24% yes; feds will run Tx Med Ctr, MD Anderson Cancer Ctr etc = disaster

@evan7257 And the French apparently have lower cholesterol than we do from drinking more wine than we do!
Solution is reduce cost of health care - make it portable & affordable NOT to nationalize it. Imagine MD Anderson Cancer Ctr run by fed gov!
When the fed govt decides when & how much to pay for which procedures, they run health care. Now imagine Texas Med Center run by fed gov't.
@jeannedouglas When fed govt decides how much to pay for which procedures, they run health care. Now imagine Tx Med Center run by fed govt.

@Dpeterson329 Obviously we should not use tax dollars to ask for votes or donations etc, or to enrich ourselves; otherwise set us free!
R u more devoted to sunlight/freedom of speech/debate, or to liberalism? Will Twitterverse rise up agnst censorship by top US gov't leaders?
@dmataconis I am paying two sets of bills now in two cities; I could never afford to pay for postage/printing to talk to my constituents
@LMack49 They cant silence me here; but if I mail w/o changes she demands, she docks my check to pay for postage/printing; I cant afford it!
R u more devoted to sunlight/freedom of speech/debate, or to liberalism? Will Twitterverse rise up agnst censorship by top US gov't leaders?
I am literally conducting a test of the Twitter community tonight: here it is - a stark and very real choice.....
@aubreykinnaman Liberal news media happily ignores her censorship bcz she is silencing critics, esp Repubs & they support her liberal agenda
@flsaltydog Spread the word: Pelosi & lib House leadership fear you, fear sunlight & fear debate so much they censor reps & shut out public
Now I bet Pelosi cancels my newsletter completely tomorrow; they were about to approve it since I made their changes; now they're mad at me
Ignore political party; oppression of a minority's right to speak/debate/amend, & censorship & media manipulation are unacceptable in USA!
This is a test of Twitter community's devotion to sunlight vs. liberalism: will Twitterverse rise up agn censorship by top US gov't leaders?
Pelosi also made me delete Obama's own words "Under my cap & trade plan, electricity prices would necessarily skyrocket" from my newsletter
Pelosi made change my newsletter headline from "cap and tax" to "cap and trade" or I would be personally liable for all postage/printing
@TimGee3 You r absolutely right; its not just me she shuts out; Pelosi is shutting YOU out & shutting out the taxpayers & the voters!
She has no control over my voice here; I work for Texas & District 7 & I will not be silenced or intimidated; her staff monitors me here too
Pelosi regularly turns off the microphone on the House floor, shuts off amends, & debate, shuts out all public sunlight, & gets away w it
@TimGee3 If we spend office funds/tax $s on a mailer not approved by Pelosi, she can dock my pay to repay its entire cost; I can't afford it
I hope Pelosi tries to silence me on social media as they have shut out opposition voices/debate/sunlight on House floor; it won't work here
Congressmen r forbidden to call Dems "liberal"; cannot call cap & trade "cap & tax" = I can't speak my mind in my own newsletter to CD7=1984
Did u know Pelosi forbids repr from saying "gov't run health care" & I can't quote Obama who said "cap & trade will make electr skyrocket"?
@kesmit3 True -but u won't read what yr conserv repr thinks bcz Pelosi is censoring our newsletters; ex:we can't say "gov't run health care"

@maslowbeer But we can switch plans now & reduce/expand coverage but IT IS OUR CHOICE; we need freedom w our MDs & our ins to bring dwn cost
@maslowbeer Blue Cross & its very expensive & I don't want you or me to lose our private health ins; at least we can switch unlike gov't run

@buszero I will check it out - thanks
@davidhust I voted no as I've been forced to do a lot these days bcz almost every bill Pelosi drops on floor grows gov't, spending & taxes
@KeithCowing I've always been a zealous supporter of medical & scientific research & America's space program as essential keys to our future
@Karoli Since I have never suggested such a thing you are raising an irrelevant distraction from fact that gov't would control health care
@Karoli Sorry but we are not acqainted - so I do not assume you are blindly using talking points. I expect you do your homework as I do

@howfine Never more important in our history to be fiscally conservative & forget party politics; economic survival of America is at stake
@maslowbeer Public option will result in single payer which means rationing of health care & gov't control over MD Anderson, etc: no thanks!

@joshuetree Real world experience shows: cutting taxes generates MORE tax revenue bcz businesses expand & people work harder to earn more
@joshuetree their definition of "increasing deficit/reducing surplus" = cutting taxes since liberals don't understand tax cuts =more revenue
@amarquart Correct but imposs under House Rules to cut spending in spending bills bcz overall spending doesn't change: any cut just rechurns
@joshuetree  Legis on "direct spending and revenues" cannotbe heard if it has "net effect of increasing the deficit or reducing the surplus"
Of course real world experience shows that cutting taxes generates MORE tax revenue bcz businesses expand & people work harder to earn more
Rule XXI Clause 10 of Pelosi's House Rules forbid tax cuts bcz they "increase the deficit/reduce the surplus": see http://tinyurl.com/lu5sch
@rmendez1 It is very constructive to try & restore transparency & public input & democratic principles to the US House of Representatives
@Laurnil Pelosi has total control over everything that happens in the House; Ex: She removed Chairman John Dingell for blocking climate bill
@Laurnil Stay tuned: I will blog the details explaining exactly how Pelosi's Rules make it illegal to cut taxes & impossible to cut spending
@gregpalmer I will - good suggestion - I will provide exact citations & examples
@Fjour I like this already: "Bastiat recognized that the greatest single	threat to liberty is government." I will read it - thanks!
@DukeStJournal See http://tinyurl.com/95bovg AND http://tinyurl.com/4fdtop AND http://tinyurl.com/nu7dpf    AND follow hyperlinks on Walker
@DukeStJournal Spending can't b cut w floor amend. on spending bill (Approps Bill) bcz overall spending/302a Budget allocation cannot b cut
@DukeStJournal Standby
@dwonderly Spending cannot be cut under Pelosi's Rules on a spending bill (Appropriations Bill) bcz overall spending can't b cut = zero cut
@dwonderly It is in the House rules under their alleged "Paygo" system & their rules on Approps Bills - I will post link from office Monday
@Fjour TY!
@lizarddawg Educating everyone about their trickery & abuse of democratic rules & working hard to find creative ways to wire around them
@DukeStJournal See my last two posts - this trickery is how Pelosi/Reid/Obama are bankrupting America & will tax our children into poverty
Under Pelosi House Rules, any spending cut by a floor amendment is quietly & automatically spent somewhere else = zero spending cut
Under Pelosi House Rules, ("PayGo"), a floor amendment cutting taxes is illegal UNLESS it also raises taxes an equal amount = zero tax cut
@Fjour Best gov't incentive of all is to leave us alone - get out of my way, out of my home, business, school etc and out of my pocket!
@willowsky Commitment to core principle matters far more as a measure of a conservative or a liberal than does party label - you are right
@hookembuzz very true - we believe in freedom - leave us alone, get gov't out of my way, off my back & out of my pocket!
I know the liberals don't want to believe it but Pelosi's Rules make it illegal to cut taxes & impossible to cut spending on House floor
@d55may Liberal leadership has shut out public scrutiny/input & almost all dissent but we can never give up or quit
@Fjour A tax break/cut or dereg or best of all - repeal a fed law or reg, close a fed agency etc & let Texans run Texas, Ohio run Ohio, etc
Conserv based on freedom = incentives to encourage good behav; liberalism based on central control = punish/tax/reg to encourage good behav
My wife Belinda says the core diff btw lib & cons: Conservatism is based on incentive & liberalism is based on punishment - she is right
Every week we conserv try to find a spending cut - any cut - the liberal majority will approve - they reject spending cuts every time

@ChiefHava I already have - repeatedly - check my website & my record
@ChiefHava I voted against $2.6 trill in new spending prop by PresGW Bush & against over $1.3 trill so far in new spending prop by PresObama
@ChiefHava I am also an original co-author of the Balanced Budget Amendment to the US Constitution
@ChiefHava I completely agree - except in time of war & genuine national emergency when approved by a supermajority of Congress
@Stranahan It is factual - Repub maj always allowed all amends/votes/open ended debate on approps bills & Pelosi shuts out virt all dissent
@ChiefHava what do you mean?
@ChiefHava Compare size ofspending bills bf & after 2006 & see my website:I voted agnst $2.6 trill in new GW Bush spending& $1.3 tril Obama

Buckminster Fuller: "Gutenburg made us all readers & Xerox made us all publishers."  Social media/www has made Iranians true revolutionaries
Support #IranElection
@slackadjusterr I have noticed conservatives are almost uniformly polite thoughtful & respectful & don't curse - adios
@jack_carlson Me too - all I ask of either side is free open debate, open amends & record votes under regular House Parliamentary Rules
@Stranahan I was here & ALL approps bills were wide open: asmany amends/ asmuch debate as anyone wanted yet Pelosi shuts off amends&debate
Texans instinctively support freedom loving people and are praying for the success of the Iranians demanding a free & fair election & gov't
Restrictions against dissent in US House cannot be compared to restrictions imposed on Iranian population by their tyrant government
Pelosi led majority shuts out the public, shuts down debate, silences ALL dissent & blots out transparency.  What do liberals say about it?
House just finishing 1st Approps bill yet majority shut out almost all amends by conserv minority to cut spending in face of record debt
How will anyone ever be able to put the brakes on Pelosi's runaway spending spree if virtually no one in Congress can amend spending bills?

"the minority possess their equal rights, which equal laws must protect & to violate which would be oppression." Pres.Thomas Jefferson, 1801
@rdutchofdukes Pelosi lib maj totally controls all bills, all debate all amends; no one even can offer an amend she won't allow to be heard
How will anyone ever be able to put the brakes on Pelosi's runaway spending spree if virtually no one in Congress can amend spending bills?
I'm always amazed at near zero outrage from liberals when Pelosi shuts out the public;Congressional transparency/accountability is essential
Sadly it's now routine for Pelosi led majority to pass massive bills w virtually no public scrutiny: little/no debate or amends or comm hrgs
Pelosi etal shut down House amendments & debate on Approps Bill to prevent conservatives from slowing down their uncontrolled spending spree
Remember the Afghans used video cameras to help defeat the Soviets in the early 1980s - just as social media will help defeat tyrants today
I hope the Iranians have lots of Nokia etc phones that can upload live video to Qik.com

@KeithCowing TY! Transparency is absolutely essential no matter who is in charge
@KeithCowing I voted against at least $2.6 trillion of new spending prop by GW Bush & over $1.3 trillion prop by Obamain the first 60 days
@mandiengram Why?
@wikiworf You have us all beat - think that may have been one of the first personal computers
@SherryBaker I don't know if I can sell mine - it still works & has a lot of pers meaning bcz it launched my lifelong passion for technology
@puresight Did your Apple predate the Lisa? We got one of the first 25 Lisas in Houston in 1985 - it's in storage w my old Kaypro
@KeithCowing It isn't my ideology: I follow Jeffersonianrepublicanism: ideology that created most powerful/prosperous/free nation in history
Actually my 1st computer in 1985 was a portable KayPro CPM machine that used 5 1/4 floppies; I still have it in the garage alongside my Lisa
@steveegg True - I created my 1st live legislative bulletin board on a Mac Lisa in Jan 1987 in the Texas House using White Knight BB program
@paulvalach The Tidal Basin needs live high res webcams right now so everyone can see how exceptionally beautiful the cherry trees are

@ToddThurman TY! I felt as though I was unfocused & have all the pieces of a great presentation that just needs more work but thanks
@utopianfiat Not familiar w it
@CapitolAnnex Mr. Jefferson's favorite saying was "If you apply core republican principle the knot will always untie itself."
@gstevens85 I think it on the Heritage Foundation website
The best expression of Th Jefferson's core beliefs, & his best hopes for us, can be found inhis ltr to Jos Cabell: http://tinyurl.com/d426hz
As I tried to express at Heritage today, Jefferson's ideas r the best to move America back on track to genuine indiv freedom&finan security
With the right idea as the place to stand, & new media as the lever, We the People will prove Archimedes right once again & move the world
It is the content of our ideas that will propel mass movement to change the direction of our nation/our gov't; new media is only the medium
I asked abt new social media tools in my discussion today w bloggers @ Heritage bcz we are still in the "Wright Bros" era of new media
On my way to Heritage Found Bloggers Conf - you can listen in and particip 12/1 pm edt - spectacular weather  - cherry blossoms in fullbloom
Good night all!
@mojosd I am already term limited to two years - every election - the real prob is fed gov't ignores the US Constit & is out of control
@mcgburson America would have a tax surplus which would leave no excuse so we would have to cut everyone's taxes = immed econom stimulus!
@velmaanne Bingo!  Plus Obama/Reid/Pelosi are driving America into bankruptcy w unpreced spending spree so lets not also pay "volunteers"
@TeacherLori Yes they help themselves regularly to our money!!
@NicholasCarr I dropped off the grid for a few days but I am back in the saddle again!
@mojosd Truly the only thing that will save us is to strictly follow the Constit, restore the 10th Amend & start shutting down fed progs etc
@ianessling We have to be compassionate & remember that liberals are ideologically handicapped so they can't help themselves!
@cajunmaverick I think the GIVE act requires us to pay VOLUNTEERS w our tax dollars despiterecord debt/deficit - I follow Dave Ramsey's plan
@Irlandia Looks like Stimulus bill (which I opposed) did not block or prevent bonuses from being paid once tax dollars sent to AIG
@mojosd I am term limited in every election - the most effective reform: restore the 10th Am pwr of States & shut down fed progs & agencies
@allengroue Yes I voted against at least $2.3 trill in new spending prop by GWBush & in just 40 days have voted ag $1.6 trill prop by Obama
@mattress Fascinating website - I will examine it w great interest - also I voted against over $2.3 tril Bush spending & $1.6 tril Obama
@smthorpe What a waste of time that was!
@bwebb The cost of passing the bill thr Congress & the cost of the signs on the Post office & reprinting letterhead -cheaper than Spendulus!
At least when Pelosi is naming post offices she is not spending money we don't have & driving our children any deeper into debt
@Bellanieve Pelosi needs to follow Dave Ramsey's advice - no more debt & pay off what we have!
Back in DC House ready to vote on naming 2 post offices again - what a waste - Rome is burning & Pelosi has us naming post offices etc etc
I feel like I dropped off the grid!  Wildly busy at work plus wife & daughter got very sick w flu but ok now
@jamesjbrownjr To vote no (as I did) on the big spending bills the Bush Administration pushed - I voted against over $2 trill Bush spending
The new majority in Congress & our new President need to strictly follow Dave Ramsey's advice to pull America out of debt & out of recession
@james3neal Thank you James - very thoughtful of you.  I will examine in detail w great interest - Mr. Jefferson would love computers & www!
@jtstl You are on target about Roehmer - White/Pelosi/Reid obviously have no plan to rescue banking system & no clue on overall economy
@carewolf10 Excellent point - where is the White House response ?  Will they wait until we see a Russian Bear bomber in Cuba? Too late then
I should say: as many people have been predicting, new media will completely absorb old media: http://tinyurl.com/d8992y

If S22 passes adios to virtually all new fossil discoveries forever; elitists who think they r smarter/better than all of us will win again
@MyrnaTheMinx There r certainly good sections of the bill; this is a very bad section that can easily be removed; if not 99% is it 98%?
RT: Ask yr Cong to vote "no" on S22 until they remove the anti-fossil collecting section; the bill has other good sections & this vrybad one
If S22 passes adios to virtually all new fossil discoveries forever; elitists who think they r smarter/better than all of us will win again
@myrnatheminx If thats all it did no one would argue but it is written broadly & criminalizes all fossil collecting in 99% of Nevada for ex
@jtyost2 State & fed parks always been protected;  S22 criminalizes picking up any fossil on any fed owned land: ex: 99% of Nevada fed owned
@myrnatheminx What??
RT:Call yr Cong Wed 3/11 in AM:ask for no vote on S22; protect innocent tourists & well meaning amateur fossil collectors from bec felons!
Obviously if someone is using backhoes & jackhammers on fed owned land to make a fortune that needs regulatng but S22 makes tourists felons
Elite museums in the East want to shut out all amateur & citizens from finding any fossils; so 5 yrs in prison, car confis & thous in fines
Sue the TRex in Chicago Field Museum was found by amatuers; almost all fossil discoveries made by amatuers but not anymore if S22 passes tom
Now Ds will make every tourist & their children & am collectors felons & confiscate your car if you pick up a fossil most anywhere out West
I am also an amateur min/fossil collector so found out this bill in 2001 fr one of my mineral clubs & I killed it every yr Rs were in charge
Tomorr Pelosi tries to pass S22 on House floor to make felons out of all amateur fossil collectors on any fed land=most of Western US

@daniesq This was always my understanding - I have never figured out how to search a PDF file - Pelosi hides everything so it is consistent
@RonStark fascinating - days are usually too busy, evenings I dont want to miss time w my family so I  wait till our daughter is in bed
@vonnie_be Thats good to know - I always understood they could not be searched which would be consistent behavior - my mistake
@yuppieskum Sure wehave lots of choices based on your freedom from gov't reg taxes etc- in particular Jeffersonian/libertarian republicanism

I hope you read his letter to Joseph Cabell: here is the key part: http://tinyurl.com/d426hz
These coreprinciples & goals that Th Jefferson dreamed about forAmericans aremy coreprinciples & this iswhy I amso passionate about newmedia
Onlynow w newmedia canevery Amer "feelthat he isa participator inthe gov't of affairsEVERY DAY [sohewillneverlet] hispower b wrested fr him"
I am a totally committed Jeffersonian & I am absolutely convinced new media opens the door for every American to achieve true freedom TJ saw
This is why none of the old media skeptics or lib critics of my Twitters faze me - old media will soon be absorbed like San Fran Chron was
And bcz you share my passion to make gov't truly transparent & elected officials totally accountable bcz we know exactly what they r doing
No matter what your politics are - I hope you follow me here bcz we share a passion to be a "participator in the gov't of [our] affairs..."
"be wrested from him by a Caesar or a Bonaparte....fortify us against the degeneracy of our gov't & the concentration of all its powers..."
"will not be a member of some of its councils, great or small, he will let the heart be torn out of his chest sooner than his power....
...in the gov't of affairs, not merely at an election one day in the year, but every day; when there shall not be a man in the State who...
"Where everyman isa sharer inthe direction ofhis wardrepublic, orof some of the higherones, & FEELS THAT HE IS A PARTICIPANT... [emph added]
"the secret [to truefreedom] willbe foundin making [eachAmerican] the depository of the powers respecting himself, so far as he is competent
"...the counties w local concerns, & each ward direct interests within itself...until it ends in the admin of every man's farm by himself."
"Let national gov't be entrusted w defense & foreign & fed relations, Stategov'ts w civil law, police, & admin ofwhat concerns the State...
"...the way to have good & safe gov't, isto divide it among the many..until it ends in the administration of every man's farm by himself..."
Today w new media We the People can achieve Mr. Jefferson's lifelongdream for America. He explains in his ltr to Jos Cabell, Jan. 24, 1816:
My true goal w social media is to realize Thomas Jefferson's dream - this will take several tweets to quote it all but I hope you read it:
@zudfunck That is actually my long term goal - a real time totally transparent federal/state/local gov't where We the People see & hear all
@daisyandus TY! New media is the future & will absorb old media very soon

@chrisbrowntv TY! you got it - the point here is to communicate in new ways w constit & the nation - our job description is representative
I am on the House floor working w fiscal conservatives to help educate the public about the immense danger of this unrestrained spending
Today once again the new Congress is spending vast sums of borrowed money with virtually no transparency.

@astrosgirlkel I am already working w J Emmitt to expand/rebuild 290 like I got I-10 expanded/rebuilt by adding both new lanes & toll lanes
Social media's effect on politics is still brand new so most elected officials prob think they can ignore us. This will change very quickly
@astrosgirlkel I voted against almost every Bush big spending bill too - I am focused on cutting spending & taxes no matter who is in charge
I will hold Rep leadership to the same transparency standards I am demanding of Dem leadership - all of us are entitled to it from our gov't
@wikiworf You should retweet that - yours is the best way to guarantee your elected officials will listen to you
@astrosgirlkel No rhetoric in any of those tweets - heartfelt pride in Texas & self evident total lack of transparency in Pelosi's Congress
@shassinger Interesting - I haven't said a word about conserv v lib/ R v D- only complained about lack of transparency which is self evident
@jcbowlin Thank God for Texas - we understand freedom & self reliance & the power of faith in the Almighty
Unless there are conseq for breaking their word elected officials will not fear the voters - w/ social media we can get the truth out
Social media network is our best hope to take back the out of control federal gov't but we must hold officials accoutable at election time
@RichBecker As the sun shines in you are right more & more will be outraged
@dwoodall That should be very interesting & enlightening thanks
@darkknight3565 One of many reasons I am always so grateful to be a Texan
@aarondelay Pelosi et al do not yet fear the social media world yet bcz this is all so new & the mainstream press lets her get away w it
A large number of social media users are outraged at Pelosi's lack of transparency but there is no earthquake after an $800 bill blind vote?
Nevertheless I will continue to campaign aggressively for total transparency & complete public scrutiny on all legislation now & forever
I do not understand why the entire social media world is not in a complete uproar over Congress' total lack of accountability & transparency
Change has definitely come to DC - I am especially grateful for Texas after a week like this

@IndyEnigma You have the sequence of whats needed exactly right - Thank you!  keep it up!
@alexashrugged It will probably be much less than 18 hrs bfr House floor vote - I am trying to err on side of more time
@carterartist Yes - lots of hearings public debate/private classified briefings: we are now winning a new democracy there & can go home soon
@robmd21 Thank you Rob -
@jburn Thank you - Ideeply appreciate it & will do my very best
@frivmo thanks - good advice - I will do my best to restrain my temper & avoid any trace of troll like behavior

@RIGHTone Not one terrorist attack on America under GWBush after 9/11 - he protected us & I am very grateful to him for that!
@PoisonTheMonkey I fought Bush & House Repub leaders whenever they tried to shut out public -secrecy is unacceptable no matter who is charge
I am signing off to keep reading the bill-we all have less than 18 hrs till House votes - See rules.house.gov & read bill posted at 10:45pm
@frivmo I agree - always look forward - lets use social media together to create true transparency asap so accountability becomes permanent!
@jmic I am offline to keep reading the "Stimulus" - less than 18 hrs for America to read & study bill is a terrible abuse of power & trust
@blwarren Plz read http://www.pgpf.org/ & study analysis of $62 trillion unfunded liability; downgrading TBills etc; stimulus magnifies prob
@frivmo I am upset bcz public & all but a handful in Congress have been shut out of writing this bill which will so change America's course
@compujeramey There are many Ds I trust who also assured me Patriot Act could only be used overseas against foreigners using cell phones
@AblativMeatshld Post what you find on blogs, send to me, yr Congressman & to whatever press will listen- primarily rely on social media
@blwarren I understand - I am a Jeffersonian/Libertarian & worry deeply about abuse of Patriot Act but was assured used only overseas
@frivmo So you're OK w you & your NY Congressman being totally shut out of writing the biggest spending bill in American history?
@TxSkirt Go to rules.house.gov & start reading the Stimulus Bill posted at 10:45pm & report what you find here & blogs - thnak you!
@PoisonTheMonkey I fought against big spending bills under Bush & fought against amnesty, Dubai port deal, & many others on principle
@MattGlazer Actually no; I voted against most of the major spending intiatives proposed by Bush; Med pres drug, Farm Bills, & fought amnesty
I hope everyone who has time will help us read the Stimulus Bill since America has less than 18 hrs bf Congress votes; see rules.house.gov
@blwarren Patriot Act was written after public hearings & input & careful thought over time -
@thewillofdc You are right Repubs lost bcz they spent too much & ignored will of the public - but this is way beyond anything seen under Rs
@blwarren you & entire nation have been shut out as biggest spending bill in history written & approved;that is tyranny & it is unacceptable
@Karoli I wish; Hoyer & Pelosi ignored the law & a unanimous House vote for minimum 48 hour posting; Rules Comm website 10:45pm 1st posting
@adrielhampton No matter who is in charge of Congress the law ensuring public debate/accountability MUST be honored or we have no freedom
RT Tmrw Congress votes blind on the biggest spendingincrease inthe history of America, & Pelosi has given you 18 hours tops 2 read the bill
You got change, America; we are now ruled by arrogant tyrants who are hypocritical, smug elitists; will you lie down & take it? NOT ME!!!
@boonyboy This is how tyrants rule; arrogant disregard of public will'opinion; utter contempt for the law - plz help expose them w new media
@vedo NO ONE IN AMERICA saw text before it was posted on the Rules Comm website about 10:45pm other than a handful of Dem staff & leaders
Dem staff still writing the bill this afternoon AFTER Conf Com approved text - TOTALLY ILLEGAL; they have NO RESPECT FOR YOU or the law!
@anaJay It also  makes me physically ill; their arrogance & utter disrespect for us & the great heritage they have been entrusted with
@boredcollegekid yes you can literally do America a great service by reading it and posting what you find here & on every blog you can - go!
@vedo go to http://www.rules.house.gov/; they only posted the text at 10:45PM; WE VOTE TOMORROW; open your eyes; they DO NOT RESPECT YOU
@DCSas Typical: they will probably keep writing the bill (totally illegal) AFTER the House approves it; who will expose them? not the press
@DCSas Arrogance: they really don't care what you think & Dem leadership also think they are much smarter than ignorant masses so why bother
@ericabiz You have now experienced a palpable truth: when the Ds force us to vote blind, we must vote no - would you buy a house this way?
Tomorrow Congress will vote blind on the biggest spending increase in the history of America, & you have at most 18 hours to read the bill
Truth now empirically obvious: new Dem Congress & Pres could care less what the public thinks - they have no respect for you or your opinion
Stimulus bill spends more money than entire ann discr budget of USA, yet only two 6 hour hearings + less than 18 hrs for America to read it
Stimulus text posted online 45 minutes ago: www.rules.house.gov/ : tom Congress will vote blind on the largest spending increase in history

Tonight is a vitally important moment in American history - lets try together tonight to slow down Nancy Pelosi's freight train
You changed House rules to open up access to social media for Congress, and the Twitterverse can slow down the Stimulus till we can read it
@tigerbeat No - tax cuts & spending cuts or bond market will be swamped w US/UK/Chinese record $5 trill bond salewho will buy them? Th what?

Tonight unelected Dem staff members are writing the biggest spending bill in US history in total secrecy & tomorrow Congress will vote blind
@michaelpleahy Who knows? it is being written in secret tonight for a floor vote tomorrow
@DenubisX Yes I will apply Wikipedia model to thistask as soon as bill is posted on the Rules Com website by farming it out to my Twitternet
@brewercrain No - only by voting it down in Congress which conservatives cannot do since we are now outnumbered -
The biggest spending bill in US history is STILL not posted online & House will vote tomorrow: here is where it will be:www.rules.house.gov/
@jenmccabegorman I am checking now - last time I looked the bill was still not posted for us to read - let me go check again - be right back
@EvaRuth Of course - Twitter is fun and useful communication
The biggest spending bill in American/world history on House floor tomorrow w only a few hrs notice for public to read/analyze - disgraceful

@kev097 Cut taxes AND spending simultaneously
@DavidShockey Free Americans unchained from gov't taxes & regulations  can conquer any problem!
@craigblanton I will see him tomorrow and will ask him for you
@andreatalley You are right!
@EvaRuth Increased savings & less consumer debt will certainly help, but when everyone keeps all of their income right now=big econom boost
@shuttersny No my point is that all Presidents should be optimistic bcz this is the greatest country on Earth - we can conquer any problem
@craigblanton New media and total transparency are our best hope to take back control over our runaway federal government
@EvaRuth Immediate and dramatic tax cuts such as you keep 100% of your income for two months
@stevequigley We do indeed
@rodbauer This is Newsweek magazine's conclusion as well - see their new issue - cover story: "We are all socialists now"
@craigblanton Staffers do not answer for me - you are always talking to me
@agfhome Cut their payroll tax to zero
@R_U_Right Of course I will be voting "no" as I did the first time and as I did against all the bailouts
@EvaRuth Dramatic & immediate tax cuts - let all Americans & all businesses keep !00% of their income for at least two months
Even Newsweek Feb 7th cover story tells us: "We are all socialists now...we will become even more French."
Nationalizing industries banks & now an unaffordable $1.3 trillion (w/ interest) spending spree will lead to more nationalization/socialism
Pres. Obama is very articulate & well informed - our most urgent priority is to find a quick effective way to restore economic growth
George Washington's portrait has ALWAYS hung to left of TR in East Room. I just noticed on DVR GW's portrait is gone - wonder where it is?
FDR was ALWAYS optimistic and famously said "we have nothing to fear but fear itself" yet Obama says we have much to fear w/o stimulus bill
Presidents have an obligation to appeal to "our better angels" w optimism and hope - but he is using fear of doom to drive us into socialism
Pres Obama says "only government that can break...cycle where lost jobs lead to...less spending." They are leading us directly intosocialism
Much better solution: all Americans get three months totally tax free. Indiv and businesses keep 100 percent of our income: instant stimulus
Watching Pres Obama press conf - whatever fiscal probs he inherited he and his team are making them 1.3 trillion times worse (w/ interest)

@JosephTX You bet Joseph - Fair tax the best solution to many problems
@xtopher42 Majority should always rule, thats ok: my objection is massive bills written in secret, no public scrutiny, no debate no sunshine
@labanjohnson Any objection to a violation of the rules is decided by the chair who is chosen by Pelosi & who will always rule against us

@PhuckPolitics You keep your money and spend it/save it yourself today instead of a bureaucrat spending your money next  year or next decade
@ahaslach For everyone who pays taxes!
The deepest darkest hole in Washington is the House floor. I am still waiting for the Sunshine Project or any transparency group to object.
He says he wants bipartisan input, noble but meaningless: his House leaders shut out all Repub input. See today's bills: www.rules.house.gov
Today Pres Obama met w House Repubs trying to win our votes for $825 bill "stimulus" - not much luck bcz we know tax cuts = better & quicker
Still in Approps Comm hearing- liberal majority won't even create a special comm to recom spending cuts to help balance the budget! Very sad
Massive spending bill and our conservative minority is being outvoted every time we try to cut spending-very frustrating but I never give up
We are live on CSpan 3 - this is a monumentally imp bill immensely complicated yet is the only hearing bcz House leaders ramming it through

RT: Lets all ask Sunlight Foundation to begin campaign calling for transparent comm. hearings, floor amends. & debate on $1 trill Stimulus
@dandrzejewski RT: Call on Sunlight Foundation to begin campaign for transparent comm. hearings, floor amend. & debate on $1 trill Stimulus
@dandrzejewski Bingo! You are right! Pelosi is leaning toward NO public hearings & NO amendments on House floor - let's insist on sunlight!
@cajunmaverick In the House, majority rules - they will win every vote no matter what motion or amend. we offer, so what are they afraid of?
@AaronKrager It's a great idea to put all bills up on www for at least 72 hrs before comm. hearings & floor votes... after all YOU hired us!
@AaronKrager Rep. maj. rules always req. comm hearings on big bills, allowed open-ended motions to recommit, amendments, esp on approps bill
@cajunmaverickRules new majority typically follow do not minority any more than one motion to recommit, now even this will be limited
@Maverick_NY There were many hearings lots of debate etc on going to war as it should be here w one of biggest spending bills in history
@JustPlainBill Next few days are crucial - Sp Pelosi is deciding whether to push through the $1 trillion "stimulus" w or w/o public hearings
American taxpayers need Sunlight Foundation, Twitter et al. to contact Sp. Pelosi to insist on public hearings for $1 trillion "stimulus"
New Congress sworn in & working. We are doing our best to cooperate & hope Dem leaders will open up legis process to full public scrutiny

Here is a document every American should see: http://tinyurl.com/95bovg. Also see: http://tinyurl.com/5qjlg8 AND http://perotcharts.com/
America will come through the financial crisis as we have other challenges ONLY if Americans know the truth - see http://tinyurl.com/5qjlg8
@adrielhampton Almost everyone is dodging it - it is too scary & requires hard decisions & sacrifice like any urgent financial prob does
@JosephTX is right - implement Fair Tax plan to grow our way out of debt, skyrocket economy - PLUS we must cut spending dramatically
@kev097 That is nonsensical - National defense is a first priority always no matter what else happens
@adrielhampton Yesbut will they apply their good transparency report card to individual bills & Exec Branch agencies as well as Congressmen?
@jmic Dramatic & immediate tax cuts for everyone. Zero cap gains tax for all & give Big 3 autos immed relief from CAFE standards & unions.
@russell_cook Stimulus bill is unaffordable. See http://tinyurl.com/5qjlg8.  Paid for w money borrowed from Chinese & repaid by our children
@CaseySoftware My point is radical restructuring of fed gov't is essential for America's financial survival. See http://tinyurl.com/5qjlg8
Restructuring of fed gov't essential - shut down fed agencies that duplicate state/local agencies&make fed grants voluntary opt in by States
@JayceHall You are right - unless we act now/cut spending dramatically & restore true Amer Republic US Treas bonds will be junk by 2020

Congrats to Joan Huffman, (R), elected tonight to Tx Senate! Decisive victory proves yet again principled conservatives will win elections
Good night all!
This week in Congress we will face another taxpayer bailout vote & we need to do our best to stop it.  Remem. $60+ trillion unfunded liab
@TerenceSmelser As a native, I could never advocate splitting Texas up but it is tantalizing to remember when libs go wild as they will
@MorgansDead Not leaving the Union -just food for thought. Texas has the right to become 5 States & this would strengthen Sen. conservatives
@TerenceSmelser 2 Rs today & after spilt; 2 new Ds from Rio Grande Valley; 6 new Rs from other 3 new States = gain of 2 new Ds, 6 new Rs
@greenbacker We would not be independent - just five States instead of one.  Again I am not advocating it - people need to know it is real
@mjkeliher You're welcome any time - just never ask a Texan how many acres or how many guns they own
@MorgansDead I am not advocating Texas split into 5 States but want people to know it is a genuine option under Annexation Joint Resolution
@JosephTX The hill is now steeper for conservatives in new Congress but our free market, indiv liberty, smaller gov't principles are strong
@shaine Thanks - any time you are ready I am
@greenbacker 2 Rs today; 2 new D Senators from the Valley; 6 new Repub Senators from the rest of Texas. I have already drawn possible maps
If liberals in DC get too out of control, Texas can redistrict for the Senate by splitting into five States creating six new Repub Senators
@TerenceSmelser Texans core belief =leave me alone: gov't stay away from my home, my family, my church, my school, my bank account & my guns
@greenbacker I feel the same way - rememb: Texas can redistrict for the US Senate by splitting into five States = six new Repub Senators
@carterartist I have never heard any hatred or meaness directed at unions from bailout opponents - our goals: protect taxpayers & job growth
@R_U_Right I could not agree more - when I see what liberal are doing in Congress I thank God for Texas & our common sense conservatism
@carterartist What?  No one I know hates unions - they are working people.  It is a fact that union CONTRACTS are suffocating US automakers
Congress should be back in session this week & I will vote "no" again against another unaffordable taxpayer bailout using borrowed money.
Good night al!
In the meantime I am working w colleagues to oppose bailout of Big 3 auto makers - the bailouts have got to stop. Taxpayers cannot afford it
Saxby Chambliss' victory tonight in Georgia very important to protect taxpayers from overreaching by new liberal majority in Congress
Good night all! I will spend time online tomorrow during the day and happily debate/discuss any issue
Each day reaffirms my decision to vote against these endless taxpayer bailouts. The era of unaffordable unfunded taxpayer liability is here.
Good night all!

@labanjohnson You are right & best way to help is get gov't tax collectors, lawyers & regulators out of the way & out of our pockets
@adamjschmidt  Yes I hope Newt Gingrich becomes new chairman of the RNC. We need his energy, his genius & his commitment to core principles.
@jeffnolan You are right, but debt hole much much deeper - at least $61 trillion in unfunded unaffordable liability. Urgent to stop spending
@JosephTX Once we stop spending tax dollars we don't have, & cut spending, you are right Joseph - time for the Fair Tax to skyrocket economy
@rbmshow No worries - I have opposed every one of these bailouts & will fight the auto bailouts & am fighting to make Fed loans transparent
@Sharon_47711 I noticed the same thing: over the top pretentious & self aggrandizing just like in their campaign. I expect much more of this
@tcarah These terrible bailouts are a bottomless money drain for our overloaded Treasury - How do they stop bailouts once started?
@batterista I am right here - just not keeping regular hours - I need to schedule a regular time so everyone will know when we can talk here
@caseysoftware No - just very long days & too exhausted at night to post - I need to schedule it like regular exercise

@mojosd I always try to find comm ground but I will not roll over & support tax increases for us to pay for wealth redistribution & bailouts
@epodcaster I know that San Antonio Toyota plant is non union bcz Texas is thankfully still Right To Work w/o joining a union
@jeremya Yes but are the avg salary numbers I gave you accurate? Can anyone out there tell me the avg salary of GM vs Toyota workers?
@mojosd By offering common sense, free market, fiscally conserv, Constitution based alternative solutions when they roll out bail outs etc.
@seanoakley You are right on point - exactly right.  Give them tax & reg relief & get unions to offer relief if they want to keep working
@jeremya I have heard avg salary at GM/Ford/Chrys is about $78 p/hr while Toyota in Kentucky etc w no unions pays about $55 - is that true?
@beulahgg You are very kind - best way to lead is quietly by example.
@jpspiderman What Star Trek trailer?  Is there a new Star Trek movie on the way? I am a huge Star Trek fan

@BreakTheirBones Thanks but my top priorities are being a good father & good husband & if I was in leadership post I would rarely see family
@RedAlertsBlog No - I just came up w it tonight after lots of thought on the biggest threats facing America & Twitter forces me to be pithy
@jeremya Union contracts suffocating GM/Ford/Chrys yet Unions refuse any concession to help bcz they expect taxpayer bailout we cant afford
@xtopher42 Relief from recentCong increase in CAFE/mileage standards which drove up their costs. Truck/SUV sales hav vanished = market works
@BreakTheirBones You are right - no bailout! Won't solve their problems. Proof seen in fact: Toyota/Honda/Hyundai etc don't need a bailout.
America entering era of unaffordable unfunded liability. My focus now built around protecting American security, solvency & sovereignty.
Strong pressure from Dem leaders to bail out GM/Ford/Chrys. Terrible public policy w no end in sight. Lets save them w tax cuts & reg relief
Good night all!
@johnculberson Thanks - my "no" votes against both Wall Street bailouts & Freddie/Fannie bailouts were perhaps the best no votes I ever cast
@mojosd That's why I changed all my yard signs two years ago to say "Culberson Keeps His Word."  Its our most important job requirement
@innismir Interesting. I see it is the only GM plant in US makinh SUVs. Ask your car dealers, they are trying everything to sell trucks/SUVs
@willjohnston I get yr Q. Prob is Pelosi passed new strict mileage standards late last year that are vry expensive & should be rolled back
@BrickandClick Bingo! Free market always the best solution - w exceptions like Wall Street bankers who obviously need strict regulation
@illuminato TY! You changed your photo
@innismir I am way behind & intend to make this a nightly event
@willjohnston No one needs to bail out Toyota/Honda etc. Their low mileage cars are what buyers want & they aren't crippled by unions
@mark_menard Visit your neighborhood car dealer & ask them what is selling - low mileage cars - their lots are loaded w unsold trucks & SUVs
@tigerbeat But note that Toyota & Honda/Hyundai etc do not need a bailout - they have kept up w the marketplace & aren't crippled by unions
@zpetersen With your permission!
@zpetersen Ha! I'm going to plagarize this one!
@innismir Visit your neighborhood car dealer - they can't sell big trucks or SUVs.  The market has already created demand for high mileage
@willjohnston Marketplace already driving up mileage - look at your neighborhood car lots loaded w unsold trucks & SUVs - let market work
@utopianfiat Bailout won't solve GM/Ford/Crys. problems - they need relief from labor unions, taxes & gov't mileage standards
@cdny National security priority to save GM/Ford/Crys. but lets save them w immed. tax cuts & relief from strict CAFE standards & unions
Twitter needs bigger better servers!
@JosephTX - I will Joseph & I am determined to keep up w Twitter & Facebook - Its just like mowing the lawn has to be done all the time
I will oppose these bailouts just as I opposed Wall Street bailouts - terrible policy. GM/Ford need relief from unions, taxes & mileage req.
As I learn more about $2 trilion Fed loan & details on latest GM/Ford bailout I will share info here w you
I am outraged by these cascading bailouts & the secretive $2 trillion loan by the Fed.  Taxpayers must know who got these loans & collateral
Thanks to all my supporters & friends in Dist 7 & on Twitter for your support & encouragement! I am very gratified & honored by this victory

@webwzrd What did the banks do w the tens of billions Fed & Treas already gave them? They hid it & won't lend it & would prob do it again
@webwzrd If we change mark to market now banks could keep bad assets on their books till they recover - big help w/o bailout/nationalization
Conserv. altern.=FDIC type insur w prem. paid by banks not taxpayers, plus change mark to market rule, cut cap gains to 0, cut corp taxes
Change mark to market account. rule alone would help immed. then cut cap gains rate to 0 & cut corp taxes to stimulate invest. w/o bailout
Sec. Paulson should recuse himself immed since he has a huge & obvious conflict of interest. Outrageous he knew prob for 1 yr & did nothing

Above all, I am absolutely thrilled and inspired by Gov Palin - America's first woman to serve as Vice President
After watching these conventions unfold I agree w Rush that Obama may be rethinking his choice of Sen Biden and wishes he had chosen Hillary
Sen McCain gave a good speech tonight and it must be clear to all that he is a patriotic and honorable man
The spirit and core values of Ronald Reagan are alive and well in the Repub convention tonight in Sarah Palin. She has relit our fire!
"There are those who use change to promote their careers, and those who use their careers to promote change - like John McCain.". So true!
She is magnificent. Even if McCain's handlers wanted to, they couldn't prevent Palin from being Palin bcz she is for real
Sarah Palin is a natural leader - she is inspiring because she her love for America and her family is so genuine and so heartfelt

@SheilaMc7 Strong beliefs & personality and her conservative record seems solid
I am convinced after seeing, hearing & learning more about Gov Palin that she is a great choice & will help Sen McCain win this election
@maslowbeer My calendar said this was an unscheduled call FYI & I was buried so was going to call you next week - sorry for miscommunication
Tremendously exciting news: Sen McCain has chosen a strong conservative woman as VP - Gov Sarah Palin of Alaska. They will win this election
Good night all!
Every campaign speech & every ad should be conducted with the same class, honesty & respect that Sen McCain's ad showed Sen Obama tonight.
@lagomorph13 KBH is my first choice and Carly Fiorina would be my second; he definitely needs a strong conserv. woman alongside him to win
@kellyniemann To win this election Sen McCain needs Senator Hutchison
I hope Senator McCain chooses Texas Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison as his Vice Presidential nominee.
Very classy McCain ad just aired on Fox - tonight is a night to offer congratulations to Sen Obama regardless of who we are voting for
Another well delivered speech and a great milestone for American history
Now we know why he chose today to accept nomination - anniversary of ML King's speech on DC Mall -
Texans proved what he just said: Houstonians + Texans did more to help Katrina victims more quickly and more effectively than fed gov't
The best answer: stop looking to fed gov't for all solutions + look to ourselves, our families, our friends and our local + state gov't 1st
Ask all candidates how they plan to pay off unfunded liability of 56+ trillion - GAO says we have about 5 years to get back on bal bud track
Important during Conven week that clear contrasts be drawn btw 2 philosophies since America's future and our safety + security depend on it.
I disagree w Sen Obama's liberalism + faith in big gov't but America's promise is evident to all when an African-Amer is nomin for President
I am on my BB so cannot see your replies - I will be back at a desktop tomorrow night and will catch up on your DMs and replies -

@technosailor Today I figured out how to zero in on my constituents for conversations if we use #tx7. It works for all districts examp: #ca9
@technosailor I knew it was coming up but that's too far out yet for me to zero in on it -
@MaryTrigiani Maybe Dana Roherbacher - Cong Pete Hoekstra & I & Cong Mike Burgess are posting here personally with no staff
@technosailor Not yet - when is our interview scheduled?
@kellscreations We will not give up this good fight to drill here drill now. Speaker Pelosi says she may let us vote - keep up the emails!
@skamphax0r I work on him every week to try & get him to sign up
@Grumpicus Cong Carter has not signed up yet for Twitter but I hound him regularly & will tell him how he can zero in on his constituents
@jjesse I haven't seen a central list yet of who is using Twitter but the list is growing
@rmcmahan0348 We are still on the House floor every day but I am in Houston campaigning & working so I won't be back on floor till Friday
@zenpundit Very scary - can you send me a link to this quote? I will fight the Fairness Doctrine on the old and the new media
This way each Congressman can use # w their state abbreviation & district number to zero in on specific conversations w their constituents
I will continue to talk directly w all of you but if you live in my district, add #tx7 to your Tweet so I will know you are a constituent
We are rapidly bypassing & absorbing the old media w Twitter Qik etc so lets add a new level of dialogue between my constituents & me
Since #dontgo works so well it occurred to me that my constituents & I can talk to each other within Twitter using the same technique
Today I am w @happykatie & @dstagg @eschipul friends & new media experts learning new communication tools & techniques
Good night all!
@wandafay Thank you! We will keep it up
@Gillis57 We need to be very careful about where we go to war & limit it to last resort where our national interests are directly at stake
@jkerrstevens I am not familiar w this but I am a big believer in opening up the government & shining sunlight everywhere - it belongs to us
@andersondb8 Pelosi will probably repeat that she is trying to save the planet, but she will cause moredrilling & pollutionin poor countries
One of my goals is to refocus foreign aid toward clean drinking water & I have been very successful - cures diseases & liberates women
@maslowbeer I agree & have done a great deal towards that goal see my award at http://culberson.house.gov/media/pdfs/WaterAdvocate07.pdf

@Karoli Take a look at Cong Johnson's bill on his website & let me know what you think - it should help bring down the cost of health ins
@Karoli See Cong Sam Johnson's bill on AHPs which is designed to give small biz the same ERISA protect big biz has to reduce health ins prem
@petersantilli I have too many sincere Qs from other people to keep up w/ your endless barrage of hostile troll Qs so I blocked you for now
@petersantilli I voted against the Mortg Bailout-unaffordable unfunded liability for taxpayers & Justice Dept will decide who goes to jail
Good night all!
@qthrul I agree - I really like the concept & will read it carefully - I have yet to meet a tax cut I did not like!
Good night all!
@maslowbeer I always enjoy thoughtful conversations, but I have to get some sleep soon. Plz call me at 713 682 8828 so we can discuss energy
@MaryTrigiani Since essentials like food medicine should be tax exempt, your tax would be as voluntary as your consumption is voluntary
@qthrul I am a co-sponsor of Fair Tax so I want to abolish the income tax for everyone & replace it w a national retail sales tax -
@maslowbeer Mid term invest in alternative fuel research, long term invest in high tech esp nano/solar/electric see Smalley Instit at Rice
@maslowbeer short term: reduce your fuel costs by drilling here & now, & then get tax collectors, lawyers & regulators out of your way
@maslowbeer Short term cut your taxes, let you pool your $$ w other small bizs for health insur to cut cost, protect you from friv lawsuits
@maslowbeer The best gov't support would be a tax credit for your investments in new tech or best of all abolish the income tax totally
@maslowbeer Miss Rogue points out I may have misunderstood your comment- small biz owners do create most jobs - I want gov't out of your way
@mojosd You are right - the trick is balance but we should always err on the side of freedom
@mojosd A trial lawyer sues anyone anytime for almost any reason no matter how small & the result stifles innovation & redistributes wealth
@maslowbeer I think over 30% of new jobs in US created in TX, biggest portion in Houston, & creating jobs to me is the best kind of progress
@maslowbeer My probusiness record means I am working to create more jobs by strengthening Houston's free enterprise atmosphere
@maslowbeer I have faith in Houston's ingenuity: proven after collapse of 1980s but officials must keep unions, trial lawyers, taxes at bay
@rebacollins Will do - thanks
@petersantilli Thievery by anyone has been outlawed. Have some faith in the good judgment of free people in free markets making good choices
@Gillis57 Yes. See Aug 4th WSJ editorial page: online.wsj.com/article/SB121780636275808495.html
@petersantilli Remember 140 characters....
@petersantilli The wisdom of nationalizing any industry can be seen in the failure of the Soviet Union.
@petersantilli @kpoirier@johnculberson here here. nationalizing oil industry will bring us the same lack of quality the education system has
@thirtydaes Trust is fundamental to our government's success at all levels, and my good name and my good judgment cannot be rented or sold
@exeverything I understand but a liberal who wants to nationalize the oil industry is a socialist
@petersantilli My independent good judgment cannot be bought, just as I assume your independent good judgment cannot be bought, right?
@petersantilli Of course major US oil company employees support me w $ bcz they agree w me just as many others who agree w me supp me w $
@exeverything I was responding to:@petersantilli who had just said to me: "Make oil industry non-profit. Nationalize it as a public benefit"
@exeverything We need both - all of the above - but let the free market do it with minimal gov't involvement - such as tax incentives
@petersantilli I try my best not to mention party anymore here - this is conservative/free market/small gov't VS liberal/socialist/big gov't
@petersantilli I am sure you cannot be bought - why besmirch me by assuming I can be bought? Drill here now is plain common sense
@jpippert Oil demand willgo up regardless sowe either drill here now OR pay more &be more depen on poor hostile nations who pollute horribly
@xtopher42 Ha!  BTW did you call Mollie at 713 682 8828 to give her your number I can call you next week to discuss in detail if you wish
The House floor revolt calling to drill here drill now shows the power of new media - a network of free people are bypassing the old media

@jtyost2 We can prove to you that it will make a huge diff - we will use our debate time onfloor to show the vast amount of oil in America
Retweeting @SmBizGuru "The Public is hungry to participate in the process on a new level" - So are we!! DC old media has ignored us forever
Cong Pete Hoekstra & I & House conservatives welcome this chance forour story tobe "tried at the bar of public opinion" since DC press won't
My hero Thomas Jefferson believedas I do that "all abuses must be tried at the bar of public opinion." New media promises total transparency
Utterly & blindly biased old media DCpress corps will not tell you these things.  I will happily help new media absorb & eliminate old media
Senate is in "pro forma session" for 5 minutes every day all summer to stop the Pres from calling a special session to drill here drill now
We would ask the Pres to call Congress into special session but the Senate used a sneaky trick to prevent this - they are still in session
I will be back on House floor tomorrow at 10 am with others asking the Speaker to call the House back for a vote to drill here drill now!
This is an exciting moment for America: this event is the dawn of real time democracy through real time representatives, and no turning back
Thanks to everyone @ Twitter/Qik today:America got a glimpse of the future. We demonstrated the power of a real time network of free people.
@petehoekstra - What a great day - lots of fun & very healthy for America & the House. Our Twitters were key Pete. CSPAN used my Qik video
@mikepratt Yes but this is a rule that needs to be broken bcz it needs to be changed to make Congress transparent to the public
I am on KSEV AM 700 live now -
@zaren Then lets get started now! Just drilling will bring prices down right away - then we need to invest in new technology like nano/solar

@ChristianBurns Yes - My only regret was that I had but one no vote to give
@JosephTX When do you sleep? You are worse than me!
@lsmft23 Good! The right outrage at the right time will happen soon & when we stop it cold we will prove the power of networked sunlight
@galaxyrdr I saw no evidence of peddled influence - a stampede maybe out of fear of Fred/Fan failure but so so wrong not to hold hearings
@batterista Ha! Since we Congressmen never know what kind or how many weapons guys like Chris have under their coats, I better obey!
@diogeneswsu TY! I am about to launch using several new communication tools. 21st Century is awesome. Wish I could live to see 22nd Century
@galaxyrdr That would be a relief - lets start by cutting taxes & spending massively & ultimately replace the income tax w a sales tax
@zenpundit Thanks - just got in & I am beat - will read this week when quieter

If you doubt the urgency of the unfunded liability problem see: www.culberson.house.gov/media/pdfs/walkerresponse031308.pdf
@ultimatejosh Seriously - forget blame - focus on solutions - we are all Americans first -unfunded $61 trill liability crisis is too urgent
@Meryl333 Bingo - For example, Congress should have passed fmr Cong. Richard Baker (La) bill to reform Fannie/Freddie years ago
@andersondb8 You will not be affected on your home purchase - effect w/in 10 years as TBills become junk bonds - see gao.gov Fiscal Wake Up
@ultimatejosh Thanks. Lets forget blame &focus on immed solutions to bal budget.TBills are junk bonds in 11 yrs: see gao.gov Fiscal Wake Up
This is why I have to vote no so often: out of control spending since I got here in 2001. Sunlight of new media urgently needed in Congress
Fed gov't now in mortgage & home remodeling biz - up to $5 trillion new liability for us & our overburdened children - both Ds & Rs to blame
@ultimatejosh Ds wrote the bail out bill in secret & Rep Pres will sign it - you & I & our kids all owe over $175,000 apiece:see gao.gov
@glennstrachan TY! No matter where we are politically we must fight together to open up gov't & fight when big bills are written in secret
Was New Deal or Medicare or SS written in secret & jammed through the House w 2hr debate, no hearings no amendments? Where is the outrage?
Senate passes Mortgage bank bail out- written in secret by liberals no hearings no amends 2 hr debate -biggest gov't expan. since New Deal
Good day to campaign & catch up - a hot Texas summer day & lots of enthusiastic volunteers working hard despite the heat
@zachflauaus Beautiful Sand Dunes Park and I think a meteor crater there near Odessa - have a great trip
@zachflauaus Where in Texas? What will you be doing?
@stevegrossman When We the People can see & hear what Congressmen see & hear in real time & make our voices heard we will see real changes
@cliffwildman Appropriations - I am on Homeland Security and Commerce, Justice Science subcommittees
Good to be back in Texas - busy weekend of campaign work & family time
Good night all!
@gnoll110 Only recentlyhe began to try touse savings to reduce deficit - cutting deficit/balancing budget must be Congress' highest priority
@gnoll110 Virtually none of Flake's amendments save a dime bcz he did not deposit savings into deficit reduction - $$ autospent elsewhere
@gnoll110 Amendmentto cut earmark doesnt save a dime unless amend. specifies cut go to deficit reduction - otherwise $ autorespent elsewhere
Good night all! Tomorrow a quieter day I can answer DMs & catch up - Congress out till Tuesday - Cong Hoekstra about to launch on Twitter
@jimogle TY! will do - leadership will never take these tools away from me & might as well regulate the wind as regulate the Internet!
@gnoll110 Law req all cut earmarks to be automatically respent immediately so no savings unless amend to cut requires deposit to cut deficit
Good night all! Tomorrow a quieter day I can answer DMs & catch up - Congress out till Tuesday - Cong Hoekstra about to launch on Twitter
@MaryTrigiani Bestway to help shinesunlight in all the dark corners of Congress is to retweet me &send me new followers who will retweet etc
@curtmercadante Great concept - any & all work to slow down & stop spending $$ our kids don't have is a very very good thing
cannot end all earmarks bcz every law passed has earmarks to spend money on the purpose of the law -we must end culture of constant spending
Remember also to cut Presidential earmarks as well - annual budget loaded w them
@curtmercadante Really well done site - congrats - remember to deposit $ saved from each cut earmark to reduce deficit or it is auto respent
@diogeneswsu Everyone in America should see how dangerous our path is - how quickly we go broke if we dont change see GAO.gov Fiscal Wake Up
@diogeneswsu key question
Noone can take money from your pocket if you are watching & the lights are on:new media=We the People can protect our pockets from Congress
@stevegrossman I really believe that social media/new media total transparency/instantaneous communication can revolutionize DC
@ariherzog I write every post personally - they monitor to keep up w me and w questions I am asked - I cause them a lot of stress
@akpoff My staff monitors my Tweets - someone plz tell me what this section is
@cliffwildman Not familiar w it
@vaspersthegrate If we do not turn this around we are on track to become another Weimar Republic w/ 60% tax rates -see GAO ltr on my website
@batterista That is exactly what Congressional majority & White House have done all WITHOUT public hearings or any amendments - outrageous
@seanr1978 We can't let them fail but we could split them up & privatize w/o socializing them as we did w/open ended liability for taxpayers
If we do not balance the budget, stop adding unfunded liablity, & making unaffordable political promises, we could become a Weimar Republic
Hi. This is Rep Pete Hoekstra. Culberson just voted to save a billion dollars. We both were on the short end of the vote. Big spenders win.
On the House floor - about to vote against a bill that will limit freedom of States to use Highway money for either bridges or highways
How did I lose over 1,000 followers in one night?  I hope I did not offend that many people all at once!  Surely this is a Twitter tech prob
Astonishing almost no one in old media paying any attention to yesterday's biggest expansion of fed gov't since New Deal w mortgage bailout
Back in session - on my way to the House floor & will report from there
See you in the morning - Good night!
I will respond to as many DMs & replies as I can either later tonight or tomorrow - the bailout bill is probably worse than I thought
Sorry I disappeared for awhile - wildly busy afternoon and evening
I can't see your responses from my Blackberry - I am still on House floor breaking the rules
Total unfunded laibilties of USA over 56 trillion yet today House voted to increase this liability by nearly 10 percent
Mortgage bail out also added 800 billion to national debt limit TODAY
America's annual budget 2 trillion - mortgage bail out taxpayer guarantee of 5 trillion in home loans - US could only pay for it w new debt
No reporters and few visitors were in the gallery to see America's gov't go into the home building and loan business - just another day
Mortgage bill creates an open ended line of credit for Freddie/Fannie to withdraw as much taxpayer cash as they want w/o repaying us ever
I am on the House floor behind current speaker breaking the rules by posting this Tweet
If you like the way FEMA handled Katrina you will love the way the fed gov't handles home loans and remodeling -
Biggest expansion of gov't since New Deal just passed House 272 to 152 - this may be the best no vote I ever cast - 5 trillion new liability
Absolute disgrace - Pelosi's House is literally run like the Supreme Soviet - she is putting FEMA style bureacrats in the Home loan business
No amendments utterly no public scrutiny on putting fed gov't in mortgage business and exposing our children to 5 trillion liabilty
Filed at 6:30pm the largest expansion of fed gov't since New Deal will be on House floor less than 18 hours later for vote.No hearings
@farrelley Salaries of private employees are always the sole responsibility of the private employer - we can vote w our dollars to object
@ultimatejosh Always better & less expensive to enforce the law - Amnesty a terrible precedent & put illegals & families on Social Security
@a9e Thank you!  I am having lots of fun and these are great communication tools
@shassinger I continue to hear estimates of 5 - 7 years to produce ANWR from people I trust - whatever it is lets get started right away!
@MaryTrigiani I am confident she is afraid of his economic big spending/tax policies
@chrisolsondc will do
At 7:30pm CDT tonight I will broadcast a live eTownhall meeting from Washington - log on www.culberson.house.gov to join us & ask questions

Good night!
@technosailor ok let me check
@MorgaineSwann Should be like the Texas sales tax, we have no income tax (thankfully) - we exempt all essentials to lessen impact on poor
@MorgaineSwann Federal gov't would receive the $ from the States who would collect fed sales tax using existing State collection system
@sanfranmash I was had tech probs & they helped me sort it out - I am up & running again breaking House rules with Qik & Twitter etc
Good night all!
@mickeyhill TY!
@toddwaller Thanks - I will tell him tomorrow on House floor & encourage him to break the rules with me!
@johnmjones Need to exempt essentials like food & medicine - let States collect it & feds have to come to States hat in hand - a good thing
@johnmjones Thats the point - all that money would be invested, saved & put to work growing the US ecomony - estimated 13% immed growth rate
@akpoff I just got my Nokia 95 phone tuned up by Qik so I will be streaming all week - I am going to set up tour for us at Lib of Congress
@MorgaineSwann We should let the States collect the sales tax; exempt food medicine essentials to minimize impact on the poor
@MaryTrigiani Best idea: abolish the income tax=keep 100% of $$ you earn - only pay when you buy = national retail sale tax. I am co-author
Good night all!

@Meryl333Twitter/new media has led us to find comm ground btw SFran. Liberals &conserv Texans:when we get together Earth will shift under DC
Lets open up total transparency & abolish withholding so we all have to write IRS checks THEN We the People will take back DC
@MorgaineSwann Cong oversight has been almost invisible way too often - exam: $12 bill in $100 bills handed out to any random sheik in Iraq
@MaryTrigiani That is priceless! I also heard you have an election to legalize streetwalkers -
@MorgaineSwann Lets open up total transparency & abolish withholding so we all have to write IRS checks THEN We the People will take back DC
@Meryl333 TY - I will send Twitter alert when that monstrosity is about to hit the House floor Wed - don't want USA to becomeWeimar Germany
@jkerrstevens Check & balance only works if there is sep of powers - today all power focused in DC:no real State or indiv power left anymore
@jkerrstevens He & Madison et al always called it republicanism = strict adherence to US Const/sep of powers btw branches esp fed & state
@MorgaineSwann Which is why bright sunlight/transparency w/ new media to public scrutiny so very very important - maybe our best hope
@MorgaineSwann This is a tough problem but it is clear fed gov't a near total failure &Congress' inertia/fear of reform also big part of it
@MorgaineSwann At will employment has to apply to everyone top to bottom
@MaryTrigiani If we would simply follow Th Jefferson's advice & shift decision making back to indiv or city or county or state = shrink feds
@agfhome Both novel ways to approach the prob which is incompetent/lazy/rude etc cannot be fired =vast waste & near total fed gov't failure
@MorgaineSwann I was in Tx House - TQM works in private sector where there are conseqs if you fail - fed gov't =perpetual life for failure
@MorgaineSwann See:www.gao.gov search: Fiscal Wake Up Tour. We have 5/10 years to get fiscal house in order or TBills are junk bonds by 2020
@MorgaineSwann Union itself key part of prob:Cannot fire anyone. incompetents have jobs for life.Fed gov't needs right to work & at will emp
@Meryl333 Banks unload 15% worst loans onto us & wewill be liable for up to $15 trillion in mortgages. Uncle Sam now in home bldg & loan biz
@MorgaineSwann Plenty of pork everywhere in fed gov't - more federal unionized employees in Dept of Agric DC offices than farmers in America
@MaryTrigiani Mortgage bankers can unload 15% of their worst loans onto we taxpayers & wewill be liable for up to $15 trillion in mortgages
@bshirley You are right - Admin should have helped us pass fmr La. Cong Richard Baker's Fred/Fannie reform bill while we had the majority
Off line for awhile finishing several letters  - then a post on need to stop biggest gov't expansion since NewDeal - mortgage take over bill
@Meryl333 Remember to see gao.gov and search for Fiscal Wake up Tour - very scary -we must literally stop spending on all but most essential
@galaxyrdr Thats absurd - we need radars & interceptors - send me a link - thanks
@Meryl333 You are fast!
@farrelley Sen Howard Baker said "Democracy died in Wash DC the day they installed air conditioning in the US Capitol." We've lost control
@claytonmorris TY! You & your audience will really enjoy this. Direct Message me anytime you need something. New media will absorb old media
@farrelley Most - but think how much more money we would all save if we would send Congress home for at least half the year
@SDWatch Good show - claytonmorris signed up & is now actively posting
@mikeplugh Large audience good opportunity to promote sunshine in Congress - we need to keep pressure up or leadership will restrict us
@galaxyrdr US missle defense here or for our allies always a good thing

@astrosfan332 Cuba permits them to drill - the majority in Congress is the only thing blocking us from drilling here for American oil & gas
Talked to Speaker Pelosi on House floor - very good conversation. I offered to help in nonpartisan way so rules treat new media as old media
@JosephTX Ask Lynn Ashby if he still lives in Pct 258, & what direction has the Chronicle taken w/o the competition of the Post?
@JosephTX First 2/3 of that statement was Buckminster Fuller - last 1/3 was me
@JosephTX Gutenburg made us all readers, Xerox made us all publishers and the Internet/Gridnet makes us all broadcasters & truly free people
@JosephTX Ultimately TV & radio & print will migrate to custom designed podcast or RSS feeds & all old media will be absorbed into new media
@JosephTX Twitter & social media allows public to see hear & respond instantaneously to expose false info from old media or elect officials
@agfhome I really appreciate your diligent and thoughtful coverage of this from day one
@agfhome Thanks for the link - Fox did a good job analyzing this complicated story

Back on the House floor	Hello from Marilyn Musgrave from Colorado
@Sassmo YouTube and Qik are 1st - blogs text Twitter etc are next
@Sassmo Loosen = posting now prohibited but ok under new rules if you dont mind sanitized websites, disclaimers & preapproved/edited posts
Big argument - House shut down - Dem Reyes said Repub Hoekstra "betrayed" intel commun - terr thing to say violates House rules
Just got fussed at for Twittering from the House floor - Rules so archaic I am in violation for commun w you using 21st Cent technology
The argument dissapated - now we are onto a scenic river bill. House leadership continues to block a vote to drill here, drill now, ANWR etc
Big argument - House shut down - Dem Reyes said Repub Hoekstra "betrayed" intel commun- terr thing to say and it violates House rules
On the House floor breaking the rules by sending this Tweet
eTownhall worked well tonight - Next I want to add a window so participants can see documents/powerpoint etc - a glimpse of the future

@mcraig I mean right alongside the main shipping lanes for the giant ships coming in & out of the Ports of Houston and Galveston - no probs
@mcraig Lots of safe enviro clean drilling visible from the Galveston seawall right next to the Houston ship channel - no probs I know of
@ariherzog Good question - let me ask around and see if I cant help set one up -
Good night all!
@netZoo If they can see enough oil & gas to make a profit they will drill - no problem but they must have access to ANWR OCS Rockies etc
@lamash Truly not nefarious as you think - most of our oil comes from hostile foreign nations - we really need to drill here drill now
@ariherzog Current rules prohibit all portals on our websites & probably prohibit this Twitter & my Qiks etc but we need to let freedom ring
@Meryl333 Thank you - keeping party labels out keeps focus on sunshine & freedom & creating open access rules for future Congresses
@Meryl333 Drill here drill now is short term - then nuclear, shale, etc, then Manhattan Project R&D nec. esp. Carbon nanotubes +solar cells
@james3neal Reps. Tim Ryan, Dan Burton, Rot Blunt and maybe a handful more I dont know about yet - every day I try to sign up more
@saynine Thanks - the social media community opened my eyes to keeping it non partisan -
@Meryl333 Always good to use our own oil so we dont fund hostile nations and we become energy independent
@bcohen01 Really good news admin will not block offshore drilling - now its up to Congress. leadership to drill here drill now to pay less
@jenmccabegorman A few weeks ago I sent a tweet from the Oval Office

@bythebayou Note that social media commun spoke & I listened & adjusted my position to amend rules to treat new media just like old media
@Scobleizer Carbon nanotube research at Rice Univ will make solar cells 60%+ efficient; solar can take over majority of elect generation
@seeker65 Small drill area, far north near shoreline; flat frozen solid very little life. Mountains in ads much farther south; ads deceptive
@MaryHodder I often tell my colleagues how simple & interesting this is - conversation/thoughtful polite debate helps Congress & the nation
Big day tomorrow; must keep raising $$ since my multimillionaire opponent has infinite $$$ - Congress in session all week: good night all!
@MaryHodder True; we would all like to get "divorced" asap but we must let field commanders tell us when it is safe to leave & how
@MaryHodder Better to do it all; check all the boxes asap; tech can protect environ;drilling now cleanly, safely right off Galveston seawall
@MaryHodder 1st make the Iraqis use their oil $$ to pay for reconstruct of anything we did not damage; pull out when commanders say its safe
@JosephTX Drill here drill now means thousands & thousands of new, well paid Amer jobs created right away plus lower gas prices right away
@Meryl333 Infra: roads, utilities, oil prod all far too old -all need massive invest BUT rem gao.gov: Fiscal Wake up tour -must cut spending
@MaryHodder ANWR drill area is flat frozen wasteland - like postage stamp on football field compared to size of all ANWR -will not damage it
@baggyrinkle You are right its simple - drill here drill now pay less!!! ANWR Rockies, Outer Cont. Shelf, shale oil (maybe 3 trill bbls) nuc
@MaryHodder 1st drill here drill now, then shale oil, nuclear etc & then invest in new Manhattan Project: nanotech; solar; renewables etc
@Meryl333 I sincerely appreciate that - thanks
@baggyrinkle As more Congressmen commun w constit&Amer using new media approv rating will go up. Representation requires good communication
@Meryl333 Yes & even in San Fran people like to drive their car instead of walk &use electr &stay warm & dry clothes w gas heat. Itsall good

I need sleep! Tweet you tomorrow!
@henrim Of course we can't deport everyone but once we start enforcing the law & make Visas accurate & quick illegals will go home
@henrim I meant Medicaid not Medicare - although I wouldnt put it past them to try to put illegals on Medicare!
@dkarchner Great idea - I will loan him my Nokia 95 if he cant get one in time -Thank you!!
@SDWatch Thanks - as a devoted Jeffersonian I am a rebel at heart
@MorgaineSwann The FISA we just passed was aimed at foreigners talking to foreigners - only an Amer judge can order a wiretap on an American
@henrim Too many leaders committed to amnesty & putting illegals on Medicare & Social Security & majority like me strongly opposed to that
@CubHugCatcher00 Thanks! More difficult to steal your money in the daylight - lots of Congressmen want to get their hands on your money
@henrim I agree - stop the floodwaters first, then make Visas accurate & quick, more H1B Visas, protect good employers & sanction bad ones
@Scobleizer look forward to talking to you - the www commun has helped redirect me onto the right target which makes me & the result better
@seattlemash Yes I support FISA so we can listen to foreigners talking to foreigners overseas about plans to kill or kidnap Americans - yes!
@colinster Thank you! I will keep using these great tools so you and I can have real time conversations

@henrim Top of my list - start by sealing the border w zero tolerance for illegal crossings - works well in Laredo & Del Rio -see my website
@SocialJulio I will congratulate her when I see her Monday - she is a wonderful person and a lot of fun
@TeelaJBrown I wont quit until the rules give me & all members the same unfettered access to new media that I have to TV/nwspaper interviews
@MorgaineSwann There is fear of the sunlight & access social/ne media will give everyone -Congress' oftenregulates what they dont understand
@GeekMommy This is an amazing& unbelievably powerful tool for We the People -Once we get this in everyones hands elected officials cant hide
@AnnePMitchell www commun helped me learn my Twitters & Qiks are illegal NOW & I learned on H floor new rules will sanitize social media
Now good night all - I will post the letter & a thank you to the Internet/Twitter community on my federal page tomorrow - w/o ref to party
Tomorrow I will send a letter to House leadership asking that we have the same unfettered access to new www media that we have to old media
Thank you for your thoughtful analysis - criticism & support all helped me think this through - esp Technosailor - We can open up Congress
You have helped me rethink & refocus on the right target. I will try tochange the rules so Congress can access new media just like old media
@firewallender Be sure to read my new post on Shelby's page - I have learned more & am refocused on an exception to the rule for new media
@seattlemash Be sure to read my post at the bottom of Shelby's webpage - I have learned more and refocused on an exception for new media

@levibethune Bingo - that is my goal - We the People looking into every dark hole in Congress & and a true no spin zone all over DC
@davideisert I am breaking the rules Twittering w a Blackberry and Qikking w a Nokia 95 - I will keep doing it - I am a representative
Cong. Daily today: Capuano "seeking to regulate video not blogs, chat rooms or written communication – “but [at] some point we may have to.”
I am drafting letter asking that rules exempt all Internet/social media posts of video/photos/text since no diff from an op ed/newsinterview
@CherylSmith999 We have been to Willamsburg & Monticello over half a dozen times - recharges my batteries
@Meryl333 They are 5 lifelong friends-signed up for agreat adventure together to fight for Texas.Its a great photo &shows their personality
@CherylSmith999 A true Jeffersonian is a born rebel
@xavierla Right no ads no political commentary from anyone anywhere on the site
So I will ask House Admin Comm to create social media/www exception so we can post just like we write op eds for papers or do TV interviews
We are voting - I am on the House floor now breaking the rules w this live Twitter post
That they will next look at imposing the same restrictions on our ability to post on Twitter blogs etc
I confirmed w Chairman Capuano the rule they are considering would limit our video posts (Qik YouTube) to santized approved websites and
I agree w Technosailor the existing House rule that prohibits this Twitter Qik etc needs to be repealed -

Twitter would be prohibited to Congressmen because We the People are free to post political comments recommending who to vote for or against
He said text/blogs/Twitter social media sites next. My analysis correct: we could only post approved content on approved sites w disclaimer

@SDWatch Thanks! by the way they were Confederates - Texans first
@Meryl333 Just watch - Mike Capuano & I are friends & my goal is to fix the problem &stop the censorship -it will be aprob solving interview
@michaelwhitney Good idea - I will find Tim and have him join me on Qikking Capuano and Brady
Stand by and watch for my Qik videos today - I will walk everyone through problem solving in Congress live on the www
I mean instantaneous
Maybe our instantaeous response on Twitter etc & followed by a live Qik interview on the House balcony will defuse this and solve it
Today I will find Capuano and Brady on House floor & ask them to do a live Qik interview to reassure us they will not censor www or congress
Good night!
I am a big believer in the 10th Amendment & letting Texans run Texas - I like their friendship, personality and the Lone Stars on their hats
@SDWatch They are 5 friends from Springfield Tx who joined Terry's Texas Rangers in 1862 and all survived the war -real personality in faces
Good night everyone!
@Adriennevh Yes - really interesting - Congress doesn't know how to deal w new media except to try to regulate it. Sunshine urgently needed
@cliffsimpson They can adopt this rule by a simple comm vote & expand existing rules to regulate Congress' use of all www social media -
@technosailor Tired & need sleep. I wrote a good explanation & will get to bed sooner by pasting it. If I had time I would vary it - thanks
@RickWolff my post would have to meet "existing content rules" (p2 of ltr) and would need a disclaimer (140 characters at least!) (see p2)
@RickWolff yes every "outside" "unofficial" website I want to use would have to be reviewed in detail & approved by the comm first & then...
@DenubisX thanks I will try it when I am not replying through my DMs
@fivemilesout But I also need a page on my official website as you suggest w specific examples of how they would restrict us and www sites

@georgedonnelly No matter who is in charge this is intolerable censorship of Congress' right to comm w We the people & it must be stopped
@kirkskodis great question - they cant - if they try to stop me I will sue them and win
This will be a good test of Twitters power - if every one of my 855 foll will ask your foll etc to email Pelosi & Capuano we can stop this
@CalvinF They are trying to ban my Twitters & every www comm from all Congressmen unless each comm has been preapproved/edited/censored
@georgedonnelly Every time I speak or write it is official unless I am on personal family business or campaign business
@zenpundit You are right on track - bury Pelosi & Capuano & your own congressmen in emails calls etc - we need more open comm not less!
@Obscura Yes note this folks - the preapproved disclaimer the Ds want will be at least 140 characters long!
@georgedonnelly If you and I talk on the phone that is an official communication - under their rule they have to censor my phone calls too
I need to post their letter proposing this censorship on my webpage
@jevdemon Good idea - Wired ought to be all over this
@JesseStay Read p 2 carefully - they will require prior approval (edit/censore/rewrite) of every Twitter/Qik/Utterz etc I send out
Remember when I first started Tweeting I said the deepest darkest hole in Washington was theHouse floor which is run like the Supreme Soviet
@mattress Tell everyone you know on www social media that the Ds are about to shut down all non approved www communication from Congressmen
No more live Qk videos - no more live Tweets from the House floor or anywhere in the Capitol - no more www communication w/o prior approval
I also must have a preapproved disclaimer on every Tweet that it is an official communication from a federal official for official business
The rule proposed by the Dems would require me to submit this Tweet to the House Franking Comm for prior approval before I cuold post it
The Dems will do this unless the Internet community stops them
Here is Dem letter asking for a rule req prior approval for all posts on Twitter etc: http://tinyurl.com/6mkvvk
Stand by for full details - I am in a meeting - about to wrap up
Indeed it is time to mobilize the entire community!
Before I could post a Tweet I would have to get approval of the twits that run the House!
They want to require prior approval of all posts to any public social media/internet/www site by any member of Congress!!!
Dem "Supreme Soviet" leadership of House would have to approve every Twitter before I could post it!!!
I just learned the Dems are trying to censor Congressmen's ability to use Twitter Qik YouTube Utterz etc - outrageous and I will fight them
Good night everyone! Congress in session tomorrow & I will keep testing the boundaries of live Qikking w/o getting into too serious trouble
The star in the foreground is also from my collection: 4th Texas regiment in Hood's Texas Brigade - the most famous Texans in the Civil War
The five young Texans in the image on my background are from Co C of Terry's Texas Rangers - it is my favorite historic photo of Texans
Trying to ID the owner of a Texas hat star in my collection from Tenn w/ script initials "ASL" - prob 8th Tx Cavalry "Terry's Texas Rangers"
As usual, up too late working on the computer.  I get a lot of work done at night after my family goes to sleep so I don't miss time w them.
@I_Armadillo Will do!
@paulvalach Good afternoon!
@defrag Vern is a good friend & a fellow science supporter. Tomorrow I will show him how easy it is and tell him you asked him to sign up.
@jeffnolan Each week is different - in Houston all last week, in session this week- Often home Fridays, weekends, Mondays sometimes mid week
I am working on legislative correspondence, campaign mailers and, as always, raising money for this election campaign.
Good night everyone!
@cheeky_geeky Those who wont adapt will go the way of the dinosaurs
@cheeky_geeky You could get me in trouble calling me a progressive! Ha!
@cheeky_geeky Wow! Newspapers are so dead - avg age of TV viewers just hit 45-50 - broadcast TV dead next - www Revolution take back DC asap
@Stranahan No prob - I always forget about DMs - I will go check now
@Stranahan If I dont hear from you I will find the Qs& answer before I go to bed - I have to get this overdue text done as well tonight
@Stranahan I will be up for another hour working on campaign & legis text & then a Halo 3 live nightcap so send Qs if you want tonight
[utterz] http://www.utterz.com/u/utt/u-NTEwODAzOA Twitter
@robinsloan Absolutely awesome - I bought Dragonspeak about a year or so ago & haven't fully figured it out - www making so much obsolete
@Stranahan If you will send me those Qs one at a time I will answer them now - more spontaneous that way too -
@robinsloan I will check it out - thanks
Thanks for the positive reinforcement on my www use - not sure what I think of Utterz - I need to figure out audio dictation to text on web
[utterz] http://www.utterz.com/u/utt/u-NTEwODAxMQ Twitter
@downwithtyranny You really need to lighten up & try to have a sense of humor - enjoy life - try having faith that people (even Rs) are good
@richpav hope you and your family are having a wonderful 4th of July weekend!
@georgedonnelly You are right free people making free choices in free markets will always make better decisions than govenrment
@farrelley call me at 202 225 2571 I am a regular at the Library of Congress and would be glad to compare notes
@maslowbeer It is regulating interstate commerce which Congress can do - I am a big fan of the 10th Amendment but this one is constitutional
@maslowbeer Later - that is way too dense for a holiday weekend but I will read through it when I am back at the Capitol next week
@ochua1 I would like to see the 10th Amendment reinstated on most issues except those set out in the Constitution - would solve many probs
@Obscura Thank you!  I hope you and your family have a safe happy 4th of July weekend
@fivemilesout I will help anyway possible to keep Arecibo open.  We can also do this in our Approps CJS bill - let me check on it next week
I hope everyone is enjoying a restful and safe July 4th holiday!
Twiiter is addictive!! Is there a term for not being able to walk away from Twitter?  I need to sleep - see you all tomorrow
@exador23 Ouch! that hurts!
@richpav Also please read www.gao.gov/cghome/d08465cg.pdf. It is terrifying & explains why I am more conservative that when I got here.
@exador23 Here is the biggest shock of all: www.gao.gov/cghome/d08465cg.pdf. This terrifying report should be read by every American
@exador23 As you will see from Simmon's brilliant papers we are about to hit a brick wall on energy couple w vast overspending = epic probs
@jcnork I told her last week on the House floor a constituent wanted her to sign onto Twitter & I was having fun w it & so should she -
@richpav Only 3 ways they will rebuild - free choice, or a fed law makes them do it or a tax credit encourages it. I am open to other ideas
@exador23 I absolutely agree w you on this one - so does Matt Simmons see his speeches and papers. Conservation and high tech will save us
@Hunter I will see her Tuesday and tell her a constituent asks her to sign up on Twitter
@exador23 No how does govt encourage a big wealthy co that was burned bad in the 80's to reinvest in infrastructure rather than dividends?
@exador23 As prices go up no question they have the money to rebuild but short of a mandate/law how does gov't encourage then to rebuild?
@richpav How do you encourage them to spend the billions necessary to rebuild infrastructure? See www.simmonsco-intl.com go to speeches
@exador23 Yes see http://tinyurl.com/2sqfg
@Hunter Beautiful old hotel across from Jones Hall - historic place
@exador23 LOL Any ideas then on how to encourage the oil cos to rebuild infrastructure and drill deep expensive wells offshore?
@Hunter Thanks - I am open to new ideas but we need drilling, production & new oil infrastructure asap & tax credits better than a new law.
@richpav Cost to rebuild old infrastructure epic expensive.  See www.simmonsco-intl.com/ great info very trusted. How to make cos build it?
@Hunter Yes my trusted constituent Matt Simmons world renowned oil expert see his website www.simmonsco-intl.com/. His opinion is rock solid
@richpav Thanks. Will always admit I am wrong if someone has a better idea. Encourage reinvestment in infrastructure instead of dividends.
@richpav Problem: growing demand from China & India & lack of supply & lack of reserves. Almost no oil reserve cushion so market is skittish
@wizardElite The biggest best field in Alaska is ANWR which we need to drill asap - can be done cleanly & will drive down price short term
@richpav How do you suggest we get new refineries, drilling rigs, pipelines, storage etc built asap?
@exador23 Drill here drill now pay less is short term help. Long term we need nano &Manhattan Project to develop new fuel for transportation
@richpav Why not reward these cos for reinvesting in infrastructure and for drilling the deepest most expensive wells where we need it most?
@richpav They are not struggling but we urgently need new refineries & new infrastructure asap.Fastest way to encourage this is tax credits
@Hunter I represent many major oil cos & worked in oil field & common sense = prices will drop as soon as market knows more oil on the way
@exador23 Tax credits to encourage necessary economic activity is always more effective and less intrusive than a law requiring the activity
@exador23 I dont think Bush is blocking tax credits for solar - I need to check reasons why credits not extended
@PoisonTheMonkey Very strange - dont know enough about it to comment
@DenubisX Yes he & I talk about our shared interest in ancient history & how mad we are re: $13 billion cash handed out to unknown Iraqis
@richpav Infrastructure very old & needs major refit - need tax credits for oil cos to rebuild infras - prices will drop fast when we drill
@exador23 Unfortunately liberals that control Congress instinctively resist cutting anyones taxes for any reason - very hard for them
@exador23 I like baby seals - but also liked my $25 tank of gas which I really miss. We can have both. Solar one of our best future choices
@jeffnolan Tell your congressman to try it out - I am trying to recruit others but most are nervous
@richpav Drill here drill now to pay less is a short term solution - we also need to open up vast shale oil reserves in western states asap
@Meryl333 Of course - my meetings w oil companies/drillers/producers I proudly represent will educate skeptics on need to drill here now!
@JohnWeir Best way to clean up Congress' secretive habits is to shine sunlight in all the dark corners
@JohnWeir Thank you!
Raising money campaigning and having fun!
@Meryl333 Yes.
@trib This technology puts We the People in every room in Washington
@stilgherrian Thank you!
@paulvalach Not true - I am very close to Cong Adam Schiff and Cong Henry Cuellar and Ciro Rodriguez of Texas and we have done great work
@Meryl333 If you dont want to drill get ready for $10 a gallon gas
@Meryl333 Like any battle I am just one soldier & can only report what I see around me - I will always report facts as I see them
@Meryl333 I am sure enough blame to go around I just report who votes with me to drill in USA and who opposes me
@Meryl333 Sorry you disagree w facts - 90%+ Ds wont drill in US while 90%+ of Rs will drill - Approp adjour to stop R drill votes see my Qik
@paulvalachAs much I vote no against growing govt & spending $ I am sure he would chastize me as well to do more to shrink the govt
@zenpundit Mr Jefferson is my hero and role model - I already planned to start w him and his library & show how Americans can still use it
I need to get back to work on my letters and campaign mailers - so I will be slow to answer
@lewellyn This why I am taking it a step at a time very carefully - give them no where to hide and little excuse for throwing me out
@lewellyn I guarantee I will get massive resistance - The Ds will have me physically removed to keep public out and protect their secrecy
@paulvalach You may mean my Qik video of Ds stopping my Approps Comm hearing on Thurs when we Rs tried to vote on amends to drill in America
@jeffsonstein Thanks - my only problem is that this is so much fun I am avoiding my homework - letters, writing campaign mailers etc
@paulvalach Video of Feinstein hearing you mentioned
@paulvalach I am always friendly & courteous but I want to Qik thmost powerful comm - Rules - Pelosi removed all cameras so public can't see
@oemperor Yes but the red light on my Nokia 95 is VERY bright and makes Congressmen very nervous
@paulvalach Can you send me a link?
@stilgherrian See my fed website culberson.house.gov - I combined a live video internet/chat/Twitter/telephone townhall mtg on Thurs night
@paulvalach I am checking carefully on when and where I will Qik first because I want to make it very difficult for the Ds to throw me out
@paulvalach No one knows because no Member of Congress has ever tried it - the public is usually barred from filing but I am a Member
@mojosd Very intrigued but very nervous
@mkrigsman Being a link in a chain of history going back to the Founders, helping to save America, and exploring history at Lib of Congress
I will find out if I can Qik treasures like TRoosevelt's diary, Lincoln's pocket contents, Lee's Lost Order at Antietam etc
I want to expose the darkest holes in Congress (House floor) & explore history of the Capitol & hidden treasures of Library of Congress
Replies is actually working again!  Hope Tweeter has upgraded their servers
@mkrigsman Its a great way for me to communicate & I really enjoy the back and forth - I have lots of dark holes in Congress to explore yet
Back in Texas - I am up and running on Twitter this afternoon in between phone calls & letters & writing campaign copy -

@tvh Awesome - thank you - with the worlds third largest oil reserves Iraq can certainly afford to pay much more of its own way -
@quepol Thank you!  I am trying to change the rules for representative gov't and put We the People in every room and every dark corner
@dvmorris Don't know what HR 6078 is but will ask my staff to help me run it down for you - I am traveling next week so be patient
@ochua1 Your home is your castle. The govt should stay away from our families, our homes, our bank accounts, our gun cases, our schools, etc
@tvh Tremendously impressive - can you send me a link to a news story I could use on the House floor to brag on Britain and ask Iraq to pay?
@mojosd The new media will open up our government to the scrutiny of all & expose the tiny secret circle in the House who write all bills
@SmoochyTX  New media/social media literally puts We the People in every room and every dark corner of our government. Long overdue sunshine
@LaniAR Thank you! the goal is to gte the gov out of our lives and our bank accounts and our gun cases completely!
@jdee  Thank you - it was fun and interesting for me - where is GTA?
@tvh One more addition to my long list of reasons to admire the British!
