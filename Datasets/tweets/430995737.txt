@Frances_Coppola All them featured boys who liked computers. 		It wasn’t long before parents started gifting personal computers to their sons, but not their daughters. Eventually, the proportion of women in tech went from 37% in 1984, to just about 18% today.
@Frances_Coppola We think it's a culture shift. When people think of coders today, they think of a dude in a hoodie in the dark, clacking away at his keyboard. How did that happen? In the 80s, Hollywood started releasing movies like Revenge of the Nerds, War Games, even Ferris Bueller’s Day Off.

"The gender gap in CS is a totally solvable problem - computer science is something girls want to do" - @crollernyc, Dir. of Advocacy and Public Policy at #GirlsWhoCode #CSforALLPA https://t.co/vALkoWXAsS
For girls, training teachers on the what of computer science is just as important as the how. We should be giving teachers the tools to create the types of classrooms that spark girls' passion for CS #CSforALLPA
You can't be what you can't see. We need to increase availability of resources that feature diverse women using tech to solve problems. #CSforALLPA
PA is a real leader in closing the gender bc of the incredible work of the @PADeptofEd in collecting, analyzing and releasing the data on participation rates by girls, and girls of color. This is the first step toward increasing girls' participation #CSforALLPA
You can’t change what you can't see. Tracking and reporting participation in CS is the first step to understanding the problem- and laying out clear interventions. #CSforALLPA https://t.co/ui2nuezoSa
Middle school is the most critical time for girls. 74% of women in computing jobs were exposed in junior high, and research suggests that exposing girls early sparks a lifelong interest in coding that dispels stereotypes about who can be a coder. #CSforALLPA

Learn more about our policy recommendations on our website, https://t.co/lO5YhZNznF. https://t.co/GP4exmD4Uf
4) Fund Professional Development With A Focus On Gender Inclusion: By funding gender inclusion training as a part of professional development, we can be sure that teachers are equipped with the tools they need to understand - &amp; correct for - how gender biases can impact learning.
3) Increase Exposure To Women And Other Underrepresented Minorities In Tech: States should provide resources for teachers that feature leaders from underrepresented communities. #RepresentationMatters
2) Expand Computer Science Courses to all Middle Schools: Middle school experience with computer science can influence whether a girl will pursue computer science in high school and, later, in the workforce.
1) Track and Report Data on Computer Science Participation: We cannot change what we cannot see- and there is little data about girls in K-12 computer science education, a critical time for driving interest and exposure to the field.
The Policy agenda includes four (4) policy recommendations for lawmakers across the country committed to closing the gender gap in tech.
Yesterday, Girls Who Code released the first-ever comprehensive agenda outlining policy recommendations designed specifically to attract girls in K-12 to, and retain them in, computer science. https://t.co/lrnw9gjArt
