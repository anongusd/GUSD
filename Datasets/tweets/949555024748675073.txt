H.R.4122 - 7 years - not even a hearing while women are receiving false-negative mammograms daily - unaware they have dense breasts masking tumors. It is shamefully 112th, 113th, 114th &amp; 115th Congress done nothing. @RepDebDingell @michaelcburgess @rosadelauro @SpeakerRyan Legacy https://t.co/svosY5nZxd
