5/5 Home state favorites usually win by a blowout. Average margin 37 points, which means they run away with the delegates. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. But that’s the way to bet.

3/5 Yes, doing well enough in IA, NH, NV and SC still matters. But the contest moves fast to mega-states. Hard to compete in Texas and California unless you’re already ramped up with money and staff.

"Walls work," @realDonaldTrump asserts, after noting that Juarez, right next to El Paso and separated by a wall (a fence, actually) has more than 1,200 murders last year, and El Paso had only 23.
That's so weird, because @realDonaldTrump says @BetoORourke rally only had 200 or 300 people. https://t.co/DZ89m75hiA
More mocking from @realDonaldTrump, who's been going out of his way to prop up Beto as a foil: "@BetoORourke had a wonderful rally of about 15 people," the president says, pretending to be a newscaster. #TrumpElPaso
"The wall's being built. It's going at a rapid pace," @realDonaldTrump says at #TrumpElPaso rally. 		Many contradictory claims about the #borderwall:	- It's already well underway.	- Construction started today.	- He needs to declare a national emergency to build it.
"Just so you know, we're building the wall anyway," @realDonaldTrump says, telling the crowd that aides told him congressional negotiators made progress, just before he took the state at #TrumpElPaso rally. So, he may not know how little #borderwall funding is in the deal.

And now we're on to the Trump tropes about "no collusion" and how Hillary Clinton is the real collusioner. Crowd chants "Lock her up!" and "CNN sucks!"	#TrumpElPaso
Now the crowd chants "Build that wall!" to drown out a protest and @realDonaldTrump says they should be saying "You really mean `finish that wall' because we've built a lot of it." #borderwall

.@realDonaldTrump mocks @BetoORourke as "a young man’s who’s got very little going for himself except he’s got a great first name." Claims Beto counterrally is tiny. "He has 200 people, 300 people. Not too good" and adds: "That may be the end of his presidential bid" #TrumpElPaso

@davesmith3 @markzbarabak Mark writes for the LA Times. I write for the Dallas Morning News. Of course we focus on our home states. ... Not sure what you mean by Democrats choosing not to compete. Every congressional district in Texas was contested in 2018.
@biderman @Redistrict Florida is basically at parity:	Republicans won 52.6% of the vote and 51.9% of US House seats (14 of 27)
@biderman Based on statewide tallies collected by the great @Redistrict:	NY: Dems won 68% of votes in US House races, got 78% of seats (21 of 27).	Calif: Dems won 66% of votes, got 87% of seats (46 of 53). 	Gerrymandering, as we wrote regarding Texas, is practiced by both parties.
To readers invoking the #ElectoralCollege to defend #gerrymandering of US House districts: EC is only for presidential elections. House seats are apportioned to states every 10 years, after the Census. Within each state, districts must then be rebalanced to equalize population.
@dennisandsandy @dallasnews Minimizing urban representation may be a motive for gerrymandering but it's not the reason that states are carved into districts. As for the "popular vote" -- after each census, US House districts are rebalanced to equalize population within each state.
@KimieRn1995 Pennsylvania is definitely not a current example of Democratic gerrymandering. Until the state supreme court stepped in this year, Republicans controlled 13 of 18 US House seats despite a near even partisan split statewide.
Texas Democrats won 47% of votes in congressional races. Should they have more than 13 of 36 seats? #Midterms2018 #redistricting #gerrymandering https://t.co/lXrTCqKljZ

Interesting joke from @GregAbbott as he tells Texas GOP convention that not only is Texas' economy bigger than Russia's -- "and that makes me more powerful than Putin!" --but that Texas had more to do with @realDonaldTrump winning than Russia. #rpt2018
"If Texas were its own country," says @GregAbbott, setting off hoots and cheers. "Let me rephrase that -- if Texas were its own country AGAIN, we would have the 10th largest economy in the world." Bigger than Russia's, "and that makes me more powerful than Putin!" #rpt2018

.@johnculberson bolted to the front after #SOTU ended and was among the first to shake @POTUS' hand and congratulate him. The Democrats' side cleared out in about 2 minutes.
When @POTUS took aim at #ChainMigration, House Minority Leader @NancyPelosi half-stood and gave the settle down gesture with both hands, to curb a brewing display of anger on her side of #sotu.
A call for more vocational education gets more bipartisan applause, though one House Dem is making the "show me the money" gesture with both hands. #sotu
btw the @POTUS is reading his #SOTU off two teleprompter screens just to his right and left. A folder containing the text is closed on his lectern -- a backup in case of malfunction, no doubt.
As @POTUS touts the tax cuts just enacted, House @WaysandMeansGOP chairman @RepKevinBrady gets an attaboy from seatmate @repgregwalden.
Senate Democrats are a lot more willing than House members to applaud at the applause lines.
"Let’s begin tonight by recognizing that the state of our Union is strong because our people are strong," says @POTUS #sotu
Democrats -- maybe half of them -- now grudgingly rise to their feet and applaud as @POTUS talks about Texans and other recovering from storms. Full bipartisan ovation for @SteveScalise, recovered from #congressionalbaseballshooting #sotu
The president is facing the Republican side of the House, smiling and returning the applause. Basically turning his back and ignoring the Democrats who have now mostly taken their seats. #sotu
Really astonishing sight as Democratic senators and congressmen stand for @POTUS but withhold applause, almost to a person. #sotu
Smattering of applause as a few House members spot @POTUS at the door, and then he's announced. Republicans are standing and applauding. Most but not all Democrats are standing. Hardly any are applauding. This is very unusual for a #SOTU
