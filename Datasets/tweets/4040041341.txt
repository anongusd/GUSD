@maverick0308 @Franklin_Graham The same argument you use to not have gun laws is shown to be hypocritical when you speak of abortions. Making abortion illegal will NOT stop abortion.

The state of today's @GOP. @marklevinshow posts his own propaganda website &amp; @JohnCornyn RT's it....days after Coast Guard Lt busted w/cache of weapons/ammo &amp; Dem hit list &amp; hours after @NRA spews this deadly bile. 		https://t.co/EMv42GHYOa https://t.co/uUNfNu9Xjn
@marklevinshow So, you're quoting your own propaganda website? And @JohnCornyn RT'd it! A Coast Guard Lt was caught w/cache of weapons/ammo &amp; a Dem hit list. @NRA just put this deadly rhetoric out. You two need to STFU!		https://t.co/EMv42GHYOa
@JohnCornyn Being Pro-Life is MUCH more than being anti-abortion! You refuse to say one word about Coast Guard Lt w/cache of weapons/ammo &amp; Dem hit list of YOUR colleagues &amp; you refuse to call out this deadly BS from the @NRA.	https://t.co/EMv42GHYOa
@SteveScalise was shot by a crazed lunatic, says he's Pro-Life, but will not say one word about this deadly and dangerous bile from the @NRA. He proudly calls himself, "David Duke without the baggage," &amp; actually became a worse person AFTER he was shot. 		https://t.co/EMv42GHYOa
@GOPChairwoman @realDonaldTrump She is a climate change denier, her billionaire hubby gave $2M to Trump's corrupt inauguration and she's willfully ignorant just like every single person Dear Leader appoints!
Up yours, Kremlin Barbie! You have no skills except for lying, treason, corruption &amp; getting plastic surgery. 		Your perp walk is going to be delicious! https://t.co/CbXBTGgkqb
@GOPChairwoman @realDonaldTrump The fact you have ZERO problem posting this BS the same week a Coast Guard Lt has cache of weapons/ammo &amp; a Dem hit list and the @NRA puts out this deadly rhetoric shows how evil you are! YOU ARE NOT PRO-LIFE!		https://t.co/EMv42GHYOa
@GOP who've received the most @NRA $$: @SenThomTillis @SenatorBurr @SenCoryGardner @SenJoniErnst @marcorubio @tedcruz @JohnCornyn @RoyBlunt @senatemajldr. @GOPChairwoman @MarshaBlackburn 		Not ONE will call out this deadly rhetoric from the NRA! 		https://t.co/EMv42GHYOa
We already know how much of a hypocrite &amp; horrible guy @Franklin_Graham is, but while claiming he's Pro-Life, he has strong ties to RU, NRA, Russian Orthodox Church &amp; Putin. 		He will NOT call this deadly rhetoric out from the @NRA.		https://t.co/EMv42GHYOa
@SteveScalise @RepAnnWagner @realDonaldTrump You are NOT Pro-Life. Being Pro-Life is MUCH more than being anti-abortion. If you were truly Pro-Life, you'd call this deadly BS out...RIGHT NOW!		https://t.co/EMv42GHYOa

@fras99 As a Christian, my Q to all the MAGA cultists/“Christians” is - what Scripture do you use to reconcile your support for a pathological liar, sexual predator, serial adulterer, racist, corrupt, treasonous mad man who caged kids? Same for what Scripture they use to reconcile 1/
