His eyes‚Äîhow they twinkled! his dimples, how merry!	His cheeks were like roses, his nose like a cherry!	His droll little mouth was drawn up like a bow,	And the beard on his chin was as white as the snow;	The stump of a pipe he held tight in his teeth, https://t.co/BQh7X1pD8y
And he looked like a pedler just opening his pack https://t.co/In7aSfOuxO
As I drew in my head, and was turning around,	Down the chimney St. Nicholas came with a bound.	He was dressed all in fur, from his head to his foot,	And his clothes were all tarnished with ashes and soot;	A bundle of toys he had flung on his back https://t.co/mUAgGY7YVN
As leaves that before the wild hurricane fly,	When they meet with an obstacle, mount to the sky;	So up to the housetop the coursers they flew	With the sleigh full of toys, and St. Nicholas too	And then, in a twinkling, I heard on the roof	The prancing &amp; pawing of each little hoof https://t.co/PggithqUED
"Now, Dasher! now, Dancer! now Prancer and Vixen!	On, Comet! on, Cupid! on, Donner and Blitzen!	To the top of the porch! to the top of the wall!	Now dash away! dash away! dash away all!" https://t.co/s0vaWHAlaD
With a little old driver so lively and quick,	I knew in a moment he must be St. Nick.	More rapid than eagles his coursers they came,	And he whistled, and shouted, and called them by name: https://t.co/Xvo2jkjytG
The moon on the breast of the new-fallen snow,	Gave a lustre of midday to objects below,	When what to my wondering eyes did appear,	But a miniature sleigh and eight tiny rein-deer, https://t.co/T9b4394O6B
When out on the lawn there arose such a clatter,	I sprang from my bed to see what was the matter.	Away to the window I flew like a flash,	Tore open the shutters and threw up the sash. https://t.co/nmvbGyS5OC
The children were nestled all snug in their beds;	While visions of sugar-plums danced in their heads	And mamma in her 'kerchief, and I in my cap,	Had just settled our brains for a long winter's nap https://t.co/jU5GOvb0Cg
Twas the night before Christmas, when all through the house	Not a creature was stirring, not even a mouse	The stockings were hung by the chimney with care,	In hopes that St. Nicholas soon would be there https://t.co/zL6BG67Lsh
