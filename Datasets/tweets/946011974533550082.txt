@thesnck @mauro_txt @realDonaldTrump I thought we were past the "what he means is" phase.
@dwchappie @APDW4MO @atrupar He has very few fans here, too. His small base is exaggerated by our media and trump himself. The majority did not vote for him and most who did have left him behind.
@Amarachi_E @brianschatz I don't understand the wait. He's done at least 109 things that an American President doesn't have the right to do. He's broken 4 billion laws. The fake outrage and inactivity is starting to bother me more than trump.
@OliviaKeenan8 @notcapnamerica Its leveled with his ears but his ears are crooked so..... but who am I to talk? I don't have half the wallet, looks, or sexual prowess he does. Obviously I know nothing.
@rachelann1519 @StevenTDennis Pretty sure the man would suffer cardiac arrest if he ever actually started working. Also pretty sure there isnt a timeline for when people are or are not allowed to "talk shit."
@WertmanAngela @funder I always hope this is true when he goes on his rants but I've come to learn it's not always the case. Sometimes I think he's just added too much Adderall to his morning covfefe.
@aliyatlecky @RichwoodsAus @TheRightMelissa @RyanHillMI @realDonaldTrump @CNN @ryanmi @fox I often wonder which one of trump's people is behind her account. I've decided its Sanders or Ivanka.
@ribblefizz @DanKEberhart @amyklobuchar She's my sen. and I'd put money down that she expects she can win. Here, Shes known as a go getter and doesn't back down when she wants something. She has great achievements in her goals for positions. I dont think she's running just for name. My two cents.

@FirearmsPB @karinella @ChrisZeleny1 @scotusreporter This is so far from the truth. The state doesnt always step in when there is a neglected child and if they do, statistically, that child will bounce around in the system being physically or sexually abused by most until they age out.
@kazgayle66 @MamaShannC @sarahwoodwriter @NLWATERS @TomiLahren 240 characters don't allow me to saw what I fully intend to mean.
@kazgayle66 @MamaShannC @sarahwoodwriter @NLWATERS @TomiLahren I am one myself. Bizarre is right, but I hear men say far too often "I send her money every month but she says I'm absent..." my point is now a days, in my visual experience, men think money equates to being there. It doesn't. Most women who abort have to make the decision alone.
@Stpolishook @bentlightnvegas @bjcreigh @OmaChatter1234 With the current voting stats repubs can easily pull off their election fraud. More voters means more dems means less chance fraud and gerrymandering will work. McConnell knows this.

@BillMatern @SenatorHassan Remove trump from office and the issue goes away, too. You do NOT give candy to the screaming child at the grocery store. You tell him "no" and if he does not stop, you remove him from the store entirely.
@chicknOG @walterowensgrpa @TheOnion @SteveKingIA I second this. And also the people who try to speak like you,,, theirs onlie one waltr,,,  seriously anoying,, for real. It ruins the entire walter Owens grandpa persona.
@ThinSkinTrump @kylegriffin1 Or Jong un.
@aterry961 I've been thinking this. It's gotten so bad the option of "the people show up and take back" is getting more and more close to reality. A scary, but likely necessary thought.
@SuzanneKelleher @markknoller Everything he writes has a sly touch of "blame the Democrats."
@EllenOShaughne1 @ChrisMurphyCT You mean Trump would open the gov again if everyone voted for his wall. Because trump is holding the gov hostage until he gets his money.
@oregon_girl3 @AdamParkhomenko How hard is it to deny a known, unapologetic liar air time? And how hard is it to say the word "Lie?"
@gcnp58 @AaronBlake Her defense was, I'm new to this and I accidentally said some wrong things, which I've since admitted were wrong. It doesnt, however, compare to the lies that Trump knows are lies yet still spews daily without apology. Yet we publicize AOC as horrible. Very, "but her emails."
@JamesTPloski @StephenAtHome @Green_Footballs In any other country that had free will and free press, %30 of a large population would be ignored. And the press wonder why Trump is still doing all the insane crap he does with no thought to being wrong. Because they keep giving him free air time as if hes loved and cherished.
@PogoChrestman @ManInTheHoody @TeamPelosi @realDonaldTrump Not faces. Actual calling out of truths. Verbal interruptions, hold up signs, ASL. Anything. Please, @SpeakerPelosi, stop the media coverage without factual evidence.
@philipg141 @LisaPLDP @ManInTheHoody @SpeakerPelosi @SpeakerPelosi this is what the people have been asking for.
@mark_amro @RyanAFournier It's like they can't see beyond Trump and the standards hes setting for what a president can do.
@pokerwig2004 @TheRickyDavila I understand enough law to know you start at the bottom and work your way up to taking down the top guy, but he literally holds the fate of the nation in his nuclear coded hands.

@ecto1outatime @walterowensgrpa Walter is a parody account who uses the face of an old white dude to make MAGA statements in the most ridiculous way to prove a point. People fall for it and yell at him, becoming #waltered. It's something to be proud of, really. Happens to the best of us.
I feel like I've been denied a rite of passage since I accidentally came across @walterowensgrpa and never had/will get the opportunity to be #waltered.
@hshaikhofficial @KrauseKellerbay @hellcorp666 @realDonaldTrump Please dont confuse Trump and his minuscule following with the majority of America.
@mariacsuarez50 @PamKeithFL This is what was said on repeat about Trump. "Wait. Give him a chance." If we know a person is wrong for the job, then we know. Also, Bernie has already made his case and it hasn't changed in the last 2 years.

@Kathysminerva @B52Malmet @joncoopertweets He doesn't have the ability to resign.   It's literally going to take forced removal to get him out. And even then he'll keep tweeting about how he's innocent until they take his phone away. He will never truly and deeply accept that he's in the wrong.
@aterry961 I believe his monetary assets are frozen by the gov. I think his properties continue on normally under a PR, unless they were involved in financial crimes. Then they're frozen too. Maybe.

@rethe125 @kolak_jason @KarMcR @sweendogz @MichaelAvenatti Racist, sexist, whataboutism, and shouty angry capital letters all in one tweet. Sounds like a fox news tweet.

We need someone who will fight, not lie down. Yes. We don't have to overlook all the negative things about Avenatti just because he has that one plus. There are others.
@kolak_jason @KarMcR @sweendogz @MichaelAvenatti Right, but both have serious financial issues, both wanted to run because they hate the other guy, not because they love the country, both have a mind to always being right with no room for negotiations, both are terrible choices for POTUS.
@kolak_jason @KarMcR @sweendogz @MichaelAvenatti That's what they all said about trump. "Hes the only one who actually speaks his mind." Avenatti is the democratic equivalency of Trump.

The difference is, I'm aware the people within the government need to do better, left or right, and still maintain my view that sexual assault is wrong. You just want people to let it fly. It tells of the kind of lifestyle you live, my man.
@brend_man @NBCPolitics @TODAYshow Yeah, I believe them until proven otherwise. I'm a leftist. I'm still not gonna go out and assault someone. And that's not because I'm a leftist. That's because I'm human.
@brend_man @NBCPolitics @TODAYshow It's not a leftist line not to rape someone. Not sexually assaulting someone isn't a partisan act.
@perlshard @ncfsoldierboy @Dukamona @melissa79334397 @pepinomarino @AnnCoulter When I think of the things I did as a teen I feel shock.

Again, The blame game helps no one get anywhere.
@Dukamona @melissa79334397 @pepinomarino @AnnCoulter MS13 didn't get her son addicted to drugs but neither did she. Blaming a parent is just as bad as blaming "illegals." Drug addiction is an illness and a serious thing. The blame game gets us no where.

@peggyflanagan My city always gets completely erased and rewritten as St. Paul. I'm not from St. Paul. Why can't these computer programs just accept me as who I am, where I'm from? Rude.
@MPRadamacue @michiyork1 @EvelynNiessner @shashanj60 @BillOReilly @CNN That's not how it works with them. They see a tweet that supports their beliefs and they believe it and share it right then and there. No evidence, proof, support, or logic needed or heard.
@ljlehere @CBSNews These kids wrote a speech about how they feel. There are plenty of videos of them mere seconds after the shooting saying the same thing. Believe it or not, kids can have their own thoughts.

@SaltyOhBrian @Steel94010 @AnnCoulter Sounds like training. Like this was a group of people, probably investigated before they were offered a gun, who were being properly trained to use them. Not a child getting ready to shoot some classmates.
@GovernorPhilW @In_The_308 @NanNCook @VERACITYNOCOMEY @tegler27 @rcjparry @Popehat It's not "playing race." The man who shot up a night club was of color, of a different religion. His family was interviewed and questioned, his wife, news coverage for months, much more. This kid was reported to FBI BEFOREHAND but is white, end of investigation. Race IS a factor.
@Steel94010 @SaltyOhBrian @AnnCoulter Grow up, Gabe. Just too childish to point out a person who's deemed too irresponsible to buy alcohol could easily obtain a weapon not made for hunting or for defense, but specifically for killing.... I'll never understand their line of thought.

@MagaMediaNews @Judekarma909 @Alyssa_Milano If someone is bad, negative things will be said. If Trump had more appealing qualities, he'd have more positive coverage. To make things up so his positive coverage average is risen would be "Fake News." Trump makes his own negative choices, can't blame media for covering them.
