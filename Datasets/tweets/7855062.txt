What a flagrantly dishonest comparison. Plenty of people don't pass interim clearances and are later able to be fully adjudicated. That's one reason why Kushner was given initial benefit of the doubt. The president overruling a final adjudication is a thoroughly different matter. https://t.co/mH7e02tp5z

I'm not shocked by the GOP hypocrisy at this point. I shocked that apparently no one is directly confronting them about it in response to these nonsense responses. https://t.co/H9Uef0kyus
The GOP ran a TWO YEAR campaign on sacred devotion to the protection of classified information. They now have no concerns and no follow up questions about Trump's own staff saying Kushner poses a security threat? AM I TAKING CRAZY PILLS??
None of those people suggested Obama had a right to grant clearances so that was that. How are members of Congress who were apoplectic over Huma Abedin now getting away with shrugging this off?! It is insane.
John Cornyn and Cory Gardner co-sponsored legislation to have Hillary Clinton and her aides clearances revoked. Paul Ryan wrote a letter asking DNI Clapper to do same. Similar letter to Kerry was signed by Perdue, Barrasso, Gardner, Isakson, Risch, Johnson, Lankford &amp; Cotton.
Here's Kevin McCarthy brushing it off. It doesn't bother him one bit that derogatory information about Kushner scared the CIA and Trump's own WH Counsel and Chief of Staff to the extent they believed Kushner unfit for access. McCarthy isn't even curious what it might be about. https://t.co/2gAsyTCtHV

That might or might not be an interesting point to debate. But at a minimum it’s less lazy than smugly refuting a straw man.
At any rate, I always enjoy a good lecture on the unitary executive. I stand by the notion that the author of the Federalist No. 51 would be unimpressed by Mr. Turner’s less than jealous guardianship of his institutional prerogatives.
So what he was arguing was not about whether Pelosi could exert her will over the president without unified control of Congress. He was saying that her discharge of her legislative function in her capacity as Speaker was less valid.
Instead Turner says that Pelosi as Speaker is less entitled to discharge her oversight function by traveling to Afghanistan because she was “elected by a small number of people in San Francisco” and the president was "elected by the entire country.”

I suppose the answer lies in whether Trump is actually better understood as a tantruming toddler or a calculating and manipulative actor who is unbothered by cruelty.
I don't intend that to make a substantive argument on what she should do. Just noting that the analogy is an interesting one in that it's an example of conventional wisdom being pretty totally wrong.
I wonder if people making the "Don't negotiate with vindictive hostage takers" analogy argument for Pelosi know that, in reality, evidence shows that policies against paying ransom are counter-productive and lead to innocent people being hurt without achieving the deterrent goal.

@carsntrains @HoarseWisperer @theinfoaddict @Jazzaloha1 I have no idea who that person is, beyond a high degree of confidence they do not have a background in US intelligence law. I'm not going to argue the point any further, but will leave it at a note of caution for people to be careful who they deem authorities.
@HoarseWisperer @theinfoaddict @Jazzaloha1 I'm sorry but that's factually wrong on the origins of 12333 and it reflects a basic misunderstanding of how minimization procedures are applied and the entirely separate guidelines for handling US persons material.

@qjurecic I think the actual root of my disagreement is that I think it unfairly stacks the deck to assume "he doesn't get away with it" in the premise. If he doesn't get away with it than the structure holds, but "structural breakdown" *is* another term for step towards authoritarianism.
@qjurecic Getting away with a serious abuse of discretion within the system (an abuse on which reasonable minds do not actually differ) is a step towards moving outside the system entirely. I'm not predicting that is what will happen. But it's a factual observation, not a panic.
@qjurecic I'm uncomfortable with "the beginning of martial law" as reflecting a certain unwarranted hysteria. But I don't see how it is inaccurate to say that smaller breakdowns are in fact steps towards total collapse.

And it isn't hysterical or overblown to think that it brings with it concerns of authoritarianism, not just in presidential abusive impulse but also in the breakdown of checks.
Congress is overwhelmingly unlikely to respond. And so the president will have gotten away with violating the express will of Congress in what it funds and doesn't fund by lying about something as important as a national emergency or troop safety. That's a really bad thing.
You might think, who cares? It's just on DOD property and it's only $500m. But that exception is meant to be used for a (true) national emergency or for the safety of troops. A court is overwhelmingly likely to defer to POTUS on this.
Sure, Trump might invoke the authority in such a way that a court restrains him. But if he is even a little bit careful, it isn't terribly difficult to get away with it. Imagine he invokes the emergency exception to re-appropriate $500m for construction on DOD property.
Is it the worst possible outcome? No. Is it unrestrained authoritarianism? No. But for the president to transparently abuse the emergency discretion granted by statute and for Congress to accede to that abuse is an exceptionally grave signal of serious structural breakdown.
As we discussed on Rational Security yesterday, I really disagree with my colleagues (@benjaminwittes and @qjurecic has expressed similar views) on the notion that Trump declaring a fictitious national emergency is not an especially bad outcome. https://t.co/jntmr1NubB

The medium is part of the message here and the networks are choosing to abet the president in a strategy designed to actively mislead the American people.
We should be clear that part of the prime time strategy here is for Trump to falsely create sense of "national emergency" by interrupting scheduled programming for a special message from the president, the same way he did with "deploying" troops and calling it an "invasion." https://t.co/SB3edIl90L

@MichaelRCaputo And until Glenn flagged that article today, I actually wasn't aware of the 2014 decision. I think I can say in reasonably good faith that I wouldn't have cared at the time, had I been aware (nor would I have cared if they granted/denied a request for W. Bush, etc).
@MichaelRCaputo Obama asked the networks to run it. Trump asked the networks to run it. There is no such this as a "formal request," if that's the distinction you are attempting to spin. There is just .... asking. They networks said no then. We will see what they say now.

@mattgurney I don't know. There's always a ton of behind the scenes stuff on committee assignments. I'm not someone who thinks Sasse is a profile in courage, but among the available options he seems more likely to oppose Trump than plenty of others who wanted an intel spot.
And it's interesting McConnell didn't decide to stick a Trump loyalist in a position that might prove incredibly sensitive down the road.
Burr has been pretty good at protecting a serious Russia investigation in SSCI. The other GOP on the committee will be in position to validate investigation findings, back Dem HPSCI, and even Mueller report so adding Trump-skeptic like Sasse could spell bad news for White House.

@TheKarlWLewis "Knowing and willful" are elements of the offense which means prosecutors would have to prove Trump knew it was a crime at the time. So in this case, genuinely relying on bad advice would be a defense. If it were true. But there's reason to doubt it is.
@DoucetteSaryn @JeffDSachs I've read the analysis and stand by my assertion. There is no evidence whatsoever to suggest that anything we are seeing is inconsistent with legitimate law enforcement, save for the president's boneheaded comment.

@gtconway3d @RosenzweigP The good news for Barr is that the later optics issue is a simple one to resolve by making clear and firm commitments in confirmation hearings, including to seek and abide by recusal guidance.
@gtconway3d @RosenzweigP Then we don't disagree. As I said the problem isn't that he expressed a view as a private citizen (though I'd argue it isn't irrelevant) but it would be a problem if the president selected him *because* he believe Barr would investigate Clinton or fire Mueller, etc.
Since Barr's nomination puts the Uranium One conspiracy theory stuff back in the news, here is a good analysis from @RosenzweigP in October 2017 that lays out the issues. https://t.co/tlQcVhSNcU
I don't know if Barr will be a disaster or not, but this point is so important. It is much much better to have a DOJ institutionalist as AG than the many wildcard names floated. Time and again, what has saved us in the part 2 years has been DOJ tradition as guardrails. https://t.co/tkMR10AX7A
@gtconway3d The actual media coverage of Secretary Clinton in 2016 disproves that as a political matter. But I'm less concerned with media than with Barr's position it qualifies as a properly predicated investigation, as articulated more cogently by @RosenzweigP here: https://t.co/TBiek75bc3
RT @EdwardGLuce: On the other hand he did sit relatively still in the national cathedral on Wednesday. https://t.co/6o27hZJiZN
@gtconway3d I think the Uranium One piece is further off the reservation than the rest. But I'm less concerned with the precise views expressed than with the suspicion he was chosen *because* of those views, if that isn't too convoluted.
This is a completely fascinating piece on historical examples of illicit "collusion" between politicians and foreign powers and the pretty remarkable overlap with the public evidence of Trump-Russia ties. https://t.co/pL9gngHsFD

In the end, I think only way to square the circle will be to confirm a generally acceptable candidate after s/he pledges recusal on Russia and any matters before DOJ on which they've made representations, publicly or privately, that might serve as an improper basis for selection. https://t.co/mwxn2YCmOM
@sam_vinograd I can think of people who would accept the job for the right reasons. I cannot think of any people who would accept the job for the right reasons who the president would plausibly choose.
We're in the near impossible position that anyone Trump would have is almost per se unacceptable, because what he wants is an Attorney General who will violate the Constitution and his or her oath. But the current situation with Whitaker is even more appalling and untenable.
But see, the apparently already mounting evidence that Barr's selection would be motivated by precisely the improper consideration one fears. https://t.co/F5uHtaZBPC
Anyone who would accept the AG job in these circumstances is inherently suspicious and should be thoroughly interrogated in confirmation hearings, but you could think of a lot worse names than this one. https://t.co/z6JQhPdpbu

@emptywheel @steve_vladeck I'm sure it was covered in one of a trillion powerpoint slides, I just don't remember it. 		I read the story to most likely be describing signals intelligence that was included in the final CIA assessment.
@emptywheel @steve_vladeck I'm not positive, but I don't think an OCA can unilaterally declassify unless they made the original determination.
@steve_vladeck Genuine question: Do you think that incremental leaks like this will do anything to change things or mount pressure on Trump to take action? Obviously it keeps the story in the headlines, which is good and may impact Congress, but I'm not sure it produces any real benefit at all.
RT @marty_lederman: There's really no excuse for this leak, which at a minimum compromises SIGINT. There'd never be an incentive for those…
@Dealfatigue @WSJ It would be disingenuous to pretend all classified information is same or any/all leaks cause grave damage. But this strikes me as a bad one.
@Dealfatigue @WSJ Complicated question, but basically no, not the same. This is very specific information that almost certainly revealed sources &amp; methods relevant to ongoing collection. We already knew CIA conclusion re: MBS &amp; Trump ignoring evidence. Hard to see real gain here, but lots of harm.
Even if that were an acceptable justification for leaking the CIA conclusion, the latest leak to the @WSJ is detailed, specific, and damaging. Intel collection is a stunningly fragile thing. I'm grateful for a free press, but whoever leaked this was very wrong to do so. https://t.co/sKAC6oe9oq
