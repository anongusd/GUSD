@BumbleZaz @HiltonHotels @doubletree @doubletreepdx My family has owned big hotels and there is no way one of our employees would ever get away with treating a guest like that. They would Immediately have been fired. And they probably would‚Äôve never gotten another job in hotel service Or as a security guard for one.

@quake_science @Redpainter1 That is just sad. That is why pay needs to be raised to a federal minimum wage of at least $15 per hour. People need to be able to save enough for emergencies like what trump has just created.
I just watched a news report about racism at DOUBLE TREE MOTEL IN OREGON. they kicked a black man out because he was sitting in the lobby! And he was a paying guest! The people involved need to be fired or a boycott of their motel needs to happen and protest out front!!!!!!!!!!!!
