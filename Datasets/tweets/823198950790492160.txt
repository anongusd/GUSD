@raptorgirlSK @MSNBC @maddow Listen, its been a crazy couple of years. You are right. I refreshed my memory in 2013, she joined the other fifteen Senate Democratic women in signing a letter that encouraged Hillary Clinton to run.
@raptorgirlSK @MSNBC @maddow In any case, she might be your hero and thats cool. Shes great. I just can't blindly follow her. I want something more. Someone with a solid sense of transparency. No distractions. A clear message.
@raptorgirlSK @MSNBC @maddow Will you agree she had aspiration for the presidency in the past but did not prove to be successful?
@raptorgirlSK @MSNBC @maddow I want a leader. Elizabeth gets stuff done but I need somone with a very large pair of whatever it takes to be president. I need a hero. We need one.
@raptorgirlSK @MSNBC @maddow Someone whose career is not a distraction. I'm tired of this bullshit. Arent you? I need the US to be represented by us, not some useless drama.
@raptorgirlSK @MSNBC @maddow She was a nominee. I'm not knocking her accomplishments. I want to vote for someone else. Not Bernie, not Hillary, not Elizabeth.
@NMAAHC @GOP look what you did! Losers.

@Freeyourmindkid It's as if we aren't reading from the same books. Maybe we aren't reading at all. I remember this kid in college, yelling at me to read s litany of authors...I wish I could remember his list but he was right. I sat and continue to sit in myths perpetuated upon me.
@Freeyourmindkid Personally I thought we reached a nu level w/ 44. Enlightenment, civility, respect, intelligence. But I find,  there is a line that I didn't know was so contrasting. So dark. So unamerican &amp; disconnected. It is upsetting. I was 2 stupid not 2 realize our apathy, our misalignment.
@Freeyourmindkid As an alabaster...maybe even a mayonnaisy one...I think we just never knew, never realized, got stuck up our asses, didn't think things were as bad as all that. Do we suck? Yes. Will we continue to screw shit up. Yes. But, some of us are fighting, yelling at the void.
