They worked in difficult and dangerous conditions to provide a good life for their families. When they retired, their pensions and health care were supposed to be there for them. Congress needs to fix this crisis + protect the benefits these workers were promised #TheyEarnedIt https://t.co/4wITgEdJN4
This week, we will have our second hearing on this critical military readiness issue in the Senate and I intend to press our military’s leaders on what actions they will take moving forward.
The living conditions at many military bases across our country are entirely unacceptable and must be addressed immediately. No family should live in a home that puts their safety and health at risk, especially the families of those charged with protecting our country. https://t.co/NNmHmB0PN4
I was honored to meet with Her Excellency Bayan Rahman of Kurdistan and the Foreign Minister Falah Mustafah earlier this week to discuss helping support healthy relations between Iraq and the Kurdistan Regional Government. https://t.co/wzJkNFGAxr

I’m proud of the work we’ve done and what we’ve accomplished for the hardworking people of Illinois during my first two years in the Senate. Here are some of the highlights in the 115th Congress: https://t.co/ls7giVsIHl
So from this former @PPact patient, let me just say this: no matter what Trump does, I will *never* stop working to ensure that every college student in need of a waitressing job, woman &amp; American has the healthcare they need. It’s the least they deserve. https://t.co/T1TrEd7cME
To the President: #HowDareYou put partisan games over women’s health. How dare you risk lives to score points with your base. How dare you try to turn women into second-class citizens.
He refuses to acknowledge the 60,000 people Planned Parenthood serves in Illinois alone every year. The 7,000 Illinoisans who rely on its clinics for cancer screenings year in and year out.
Donald Trump doesn’t seem to get what’s at stake. He doesn’t seem to care that he’s making it harder for predominantly low-income Americans to access the care they desperately need.
I was only able to pay for college through a heck of a lot of waitressing. But I needed to have a physical to even get that job. So I went to @PPact for that basic care, because that’s all I could afford on a student’s budget.
Shameful, sexist and just plain dangerous. The Trump Admin’s #GagRule shows that it cares more about political stunts than the 2.7 million Americans who rely on Planned Parenthood for basic, lifesaving healthcare every year. *I* was one of these Americans...
The 100,000+ commuters impacted by @ChiUnionStation signal issues yesterday deserve a better explanation. @SenatorDurbin and I are urging @Amtrak to be transparent about what happened and develop new procedures to ensure it does not happen again. https://t.co/fKPIT7VtFS
One of the best ways we can give back to our country is by dedicating ourselves to service. The @PeaceCorps has allowed the very best of us to serve in grassroots-driven and long-lasting ways across the globe. Congratulations on 58 years of service!
Proud to join @SenatorDurbin, @RepBillFoster &amp; @RepUnderwood in introducing legislation to honor the five lives we lost last month in Aurora – Travor, Clayton, Vincente, Russell and Josh. My heart is with their families, friends the brave first responders and the city of Aurora. https://t.co/RNjkUVU9C2
I'm glad that so far he's followed through on his promise to make himself accessible, but he should know that I’ll continue to hold him accountable if and when his agency’s policies fail to protect American families. Read my full statement here → https://t.co/WkcxebwdHU
There are a number of reasons I voted against Andrew Wheeler’s confirmation as @EPA administrator—including his refusal to address climate change, his agency’s handling of the Sterigenics crisis &amp; his penchant for choosing big polluters over American farmers.
.@VOAofIL Volunteers help serve communities that need it most across Illinois. Glad to have met with them this afternoon to chat about how important service is for our nation. https://t.co/MKnqttJEY0
That’s one reason I’m proud to join @ChrisVanHollen, @RepDonBeyer and @SenFeinstein to reintroduce legislation today to help young Americans become more civically engaged. https://t.co/fVonl7t813
The right to vote is a founding tenet of our democracy, and it's strength depends upon the participation of the American people. We should be doing everything we can to make it easier – not harder – for Americans to access the ballot box.
100%. I'm glad to have helped the ppl of Willowbrook work to #StopSterigenics &amp; to have introduced legislation to help communities who are undertaking similar fights across this country. No family should breathe toxic air regardless of where they live or how much $ they have. https://t.co/9YhLAdVkY3
We must be clear that any deal will require full accounting of DPRK’s nuclear program, which allows the robust verification measures needed to ensure compliance. Read my full statement on how we can force Kim Jong Un to return to the negotiating table: ➡️ https://t.co/OIeqmUxXiK
I'm relieved the U.S. refused to end sanctions in return for the dismantling of only one of Kim Jong Un’s many nuclear sites and that the administration did not sacrifice our leverage simply for the optics of making a deal. https://t.co/h1StZur1rP

There are a lot of reasons I oppose Mr. Wheeler’s nomination to be EPA administrator--here are five of them: https://t.co/5P8IOsxrl2
This is another reason to be concerned over the Trump Administration’s failure to articulate an agreed upon definition with the DPRK of what “denuclearization” actually means.
This is bad news. Let’s be clear: if north Korea does not have to disclose its nuclear weapons program, it will be impossible to demand all its facilities be dismantled or verify whether Kim Jong Un is complying with any deal. https://t.co/3xuOIFdsZ0
We need to lower the barriers that deter survivors of military sexual trauma from reporting incidents when they happen. I spoke with military leaders at today’s Armed Services Committee hearing about how we can make it easier for survivors to come forward: https://t.co/2cTYKGrY17

EPA’s enforcement actions under the Clean Air Act dropped by 40% in 2018 to their lowest levels in more than ten years! Families in IL and across the country are being poisoned by known toxins and @EPA's failure to hold them accountable is unacceptable. https://t.co/idMouO6izv

I’m glad to join @SenatorCarper in intro'ing this resolution calling on Congress to take immediate action https://t.co/OoiqD33ZXT
Unfortunately, Trump’s willingness to discard the recommendations of our military leaders and the intelligence community in favor of any dictator or despot who plays to his ego does not leave me optimistic that a good deal with Kim Jong Un will be reached...
Donald Trump accomplished little during the 1st summit aside from elevating a brutal, cruel dictator on the world stage. It's critical for this meeting to not just be another PR stunt and that POTUS obtain measurable &amp; verifiable commitments to denuclearize the Korean Peninsula. https://t.co/6t1m95ymnj
Donald Trump's decision to declare a National Emergency to try to fulfill a campaign promise undermines the Constitution. I’m glad the House of Representatives is pushing back on this reckless abuse of power and urge Senate Republicans who’ve been critical of this to do the same. https://t.co/saLuFR7ZvC
This is exactly why Congress must debate and replace our outdated AUMF and give Americans a chance to weigh the costs of war. Our troops will carry out any mission they’re asked to, but that courage is not matched by some representing them Congress. https://t.co/SuSEnrNfVk
Good meeting with General Mark Milley, the choice to be the next Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, to discuss how we can better ensure our servicemembers are trained and equipped to fight for our nation. https://t.co/s2GmfYSm4y
This legislation is an important step in continuing to expand healthcare coverage for women, like the 144,000 who undergo mastectomies annually. I’ll keep working to ensure survivors and all women have access to the healthcare they need.
We can do so much more to help survivors of breast cancer return to health and achieve the best quality of life. That's why I'm introducing the Breast Cancer Patient Equity Act with @lisamurkowski, @RepJudyChu &amp; @RepWalorski https://t.co/rhPlmbeUzk

This bipartisan deal responsibly includes funding to secure our border with the use of 21st century technology w/out wasting billions on the medieval border wall Donald Trump promised Mexico would pay for. I urge the President to sign it into law ASAP to prevent another shutdown.
It increases our investments in infrastructure, public health and environmental safety and it provides local communities with more resources to address the opioid epidemic.
Instead of forcing federal workers and their families to once again go without pay, this deal gives them a well-deserved cost-of-living increase.
This bipartisan deal is not perfect, but it prevents another wasteful and unnecessary government shutdown that hurts our economy and holds the paychecks of hundreds of thousands of government employees and contractors hostage.

But rather than addressing these causes head on, the Trump Administration is slashing the budgets of many agencies that could both help address the root causes and increase security for our servicemembers overseas.

It’s unfortunate that the commander-in-chief did not use tonight as an opportunity to change course or deliver a positive and inclusive message that moves us forward as a nation.
He missed a critical opportunity to present credible solutions to some of the serious challenges facing our country, like our crumbling infrastructure &amp; rising health care costs. The American people are counting on their elected leaders to come together on these difficult issues.
...the President played on America’s internal divisions and employed his usual xenophobic attacks on immigrants. Instead of proposing ethics reforms to clean up Washington, he asked Congress and law enforcement to stop investigating misconduct in his administration.
Tonight, we saw the same reckless rhetoric that has been a signature of Donald Trump’s presidency. Instead of attempting to unite the country and bring people together after the ridiculous and unnecessary government shutdown... https://t.co/gBKKvMmuhz
I am also calling on EPA to investigate recent alarming allegations made by former Sterigenics employees that the company intentionally violated the law and put their own employees at risk. https://t.co/aqIvMZmb0D
EPA must immediately tell the public whether these elevated ethylene oxide levels pose the ‘substantial and imminent threat’ to public health that, under the Clean Air Act, provides EPA with broad authority to shut down dangerous facilities.
New EPA data confirms what we have feared: Sterigenics continues to pose a threat to the health of its neighbors. While it cannot undo the damage that has already been done to families in the Willowbrook area, the EPA can act to prevent further harm to our children.

Across this country ethanol facilities are shutting down because of this Administration’s damaging policies. I will continue to hold him accountable when he fails to put our farmers first.
The truth, however, is very different. Under Mr. Wheeler, EPA has continued to abuse policies meant to assist small refineries to help Big Oil companies like Exxon and Chevron--that have billion dollar profits--at the expense of the American farmer.
During his nomination hearing, Mr. Wheeler claimed to be implementing the Renewable Fuels Standard (RFS) the way Congress intended.

I’m proud to support @SenBlumenthal’s resolution to recognize the second anniversary of Trump’s travel ban. We can do much more to recognize and support the rights of refugees
Families are fearful of flying home to see loved ones, while refugees and asylum seekers wait endlessly in dangerous situations. Turning people away from our country because of where they were born or the religion they practice is wholly un-American &amp; betrays our nation’s values.
Since then, Donald Trump has time and again wrongfully characterized entire countries, faiths and peoples in pursuit of xenophobic and sometimes hateful policies.
It’s been two years since Donald Trump issued his discriminatory Muslim travel ban, preventing travelers, vetted refugees and their families – and even green card holders – from entering the United States.
Thanks to Donald Trump’s five-week shutdown, our economy lost billions of dollars – and he is already talking about the next one. Hardworking Americans can’t afford to keep paying the tab for his temper tantrums. https://t.co/gqZ0GS0vQZ

Whether it’s wasting billions on tax cuts for millionaires or on stealing people’s property to build a wall, we already know the Republican playbook: explode the deficit now and later try to lower it by slashing Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security later.
If Trump gets away with spending billions of YOUR tax dollars on an ineffective wall Mexico won’t pay for, ultimately Medicare will.
Donald Trump’s weakness and failure has led him to break his promise of getting Mexico to pay for his ineffective wall.
Mitch McConnell needs to stop protecting Trump from looking like a fool for picking a fight he can't win, and McConnell needs to let the Senate end this shutdown today.
Hundreds of thousands of hardworking American's livelihoods are being held hostage by Donald Trump's ridiculous demands for billions in wall funding, and this supposed "offer" does nothing to change that.
The House has now passed bipartisan bills written by Senate Republicans to end the shutdown too, but Mitch McConnell is blocking Senate votes on those same bills that he supported just a few weeks ago.

If you can’t pass a background check, you shouldn’t be able to purchase a firearm. @SenatorDurbin &amp;I joined 38 colleagues in re-introducing the Background Check Expansion Act this wk because it's long past time Congress acted on this common-sense solution https://t.co/6yHXv8sgEO

I just joined @SenatorCardin &amp; my colleagues on the Senate floor to ask for unanimous consent to vote to re-open the government immediately. Unfortunately Mitch McConnell objected. This unnecessary #TrumpShutdown is hurting our country. When will enough be enough???
My brother was a Coastie and this is appalling. It's clear the #TrumpShutdown is hurting military families and damaging our national security. The House has passed *bipartisan* legislation to reopen the government. Senate GOP should IMMEDIATELY let us vote to do the same. https://t.co/fZ35sMzADe
👀 Donald Trump made it clear: he wants to continue to hold our gvt hostage in order to extort American taxpayers into funding the wall he promised Mexico would pay for. 		When will Mitch McConnell and Senate Republicans stop enabling this crisis? https://t.co/a104jzxATI
Congratulations to the new legislators being sworn in to the 101st Illinois General Assembly today! I’m eager to start working together to help hardworking families across our state.
From @WashingtonPost: “The furloughing of hundreds of @US_FDA inspectors has sharply reduced inspections of the nation’s food supply — one of many repercussions of the partial government shutdown that make Americans potentially less safe.” https://t.co/RFV1Ftb1hl
Congress must come together and reassert itself as a coequal branch of government. It is our Constitutional responsibility to check an increasingly desperate and isolated individual who is acting more like a despot than a President.
If Donald Trump thinks he can declare a national emergency where none exists to win a political fight, what’s to stop him from declaring a national emergency or invoking war powers to unconstitutionally imprison Americans based on race?
I asked the Trump Administration to explain this chilling action and answer a simple question: does DOD believe that anti-canon Korematsu, Hirabayashi and Yasui represent good law? I have yet to receive an answer. https://t.co/Kc3Kf4kZ5K
The Department of Defense positively cited a WWII-era SCOTUS case that allowed the government to impose mass curfews of Americans based on race. DOD didn’t do this decades ago. DOD positively cited the disgraced decision in Hirabayashi v. United States *last year* -- 2018.
The power to declare a national emergency is a solemn responsibility that should never be abused by a Commander in Chief. Today, we may be debating the improper use of military construction funds, but tomorrow it could be mass internment or worse.

It’s past time for Mitch McConnell to call for a vote on the Republican-written bills—that he supported just a few weeks ago—so we can end this needless #TrumpShutdown.
I’ve voted for enhanced security at ports of entry and along our borders (more personnel, better technology, etc) before and I’m willing to again.
The #TrumpShutdown is threatening our national security. TSA officers all over this country are not receiving pay and struggling to cover their basic needs – we must focus on re-opening government and keep them on the job, not wasting taxpayer money on an ineffective wall.
Whatever #AlternativeFacts Donald Trump uses tonight, here’s the truth: Trump is holding our government hostage to extort taxpayers and break his campaign promise that Mexico would pay for his ineffective wall. Mitch McConnell must let us vote to reopen the government immediately
This is not only adorable, but reaffirms how important it is to have parents in the workforce and in leadership positions. https://t.co/JvpM1mxL0D
Instead, McConnell &amp; GOP Leadership are having us vote on bills that the State + Interior Depts would carry out, but they’re REFUSING to bring up legislation to open those depts &amp; bring back employees who have been furloughed. Getting the gvt back up &amp; running should come FIRST
Enough is enough. The #TrumpShutdown is punishing the American ppl. Getting the government back open and running must be our top priority and Mitch McConnell must let the Senate vote on bipartisan legislation to make that happen.
Yesterday, I toured @Wiegeltoolworks factory in Wood Dale, with third-generation owners Aaron, Erica &amp; Ryan Wiegel to discuss workforce development, career &amp; technical education.

48 years ago this week the Clean Air Act became effective nationwide, helping protect the health of families and the quality of our toxic emissions. The Trump Administration’s continued efforts to undermine this landmark public health law is unacceptable.
With the House passing these funding bills that Senator McConnell ALREADY supported – the Senate should quickly vote AGAIN to pass these 6 bills that exemplify bipartisan compromise—and finally end this harmful #TrumpShutdown.
Put simply, an overwhelming number of Republican Senators ALREADY voted YES on passing the very same funding bills to end the Trump Shutdown.
Senator McConnell ALSO voted YES in committee on the remaining 2 funding bills that the House just passed to reopen the government.
To repeat: Senators Schumer &amp; McConnell, along with 90 Republican &amp; Democratic Senators, ALREADY voted YES on passing 4 of the 6 bills that the new Democratic House majority just passed in an effort to end the Trump Shutdown.
The new House majority is offering a bipartisan solution to end this #TrumpShutdown. Speaker Pelosi just brought 4 funding bills to the House floor that ALREADY passed the Senate by a bipartisan vote of 92 to 6.

By rolling back the lifesaving standards responsible for the dramatic reduction of mercury and other toxins in our air, the Trump Administration has once again abandoned its duty to protect the public health of our babies and our children.

Now that Donald Trump has shut down the government, Speaker Ryan should schedule a vote on the Federal Employee Fair Treatment Act ASAP. It passed the Senate yesterday — and it will at least give federal workers the peace of mind they’ll be paid when this ridiculous shutdown ends
To my GOP colleagues, let’s not punish the American taxpayers by going further down this road. We already passed a bipartisan bill to fund the government. Let’s change course before it’s too late.
That would be $5 billion of OUR taxpayer dollars that wouldn’t get spent on improving our infrastructure &amp; making childcare more affordable. On helping more students attend college or making pre-k universal. Or on the VA backlog, GI benefits or on taking care of our Veterans....
Trump wants to shut down the government right before Xmas unless Congress agrees to waste $5 billion of American tax dollars on something he promised Mexico would pay for.
If Donald Trump shuts down the government, it could hurt our economy, cost taxpayers tens of millions of dollars and deprive hundreds of thousands of federal employees of their paychecks at Xmas time. Congressional Republicans must change course before it’s too late.

There’s still time to stop this rule change though. The public comment period ends on Monday: https://t.co/RnxJcQQV5M
I can’t begin to imagine what it would’ve been like to have to decide between going hungry and having my mother at home, but that’s the choice other families may have to make if Trump’s proposal gets implemented.
The goal of his new rule is clear: to vilify immigrants, scaring them away from getting the care they desperately need in an attempt to push—even starve—them out of this country.
Right now, POTUS is trying to change the law to force immigrant families to choose b/w staying eligible for perm. residency &amp; receiving lifesaving public benefits like SNAP &amp; Medicaid.
In the end, we survived. We scraped by. And my mother was able to join us (later becoming a proud U.S. citizen). But if President Trump has his way, the same might not be true for countless other scared, struggling families.
I still remember going to the grocery store and counting out our last five $1 food stamps to buy as much bread and bologna as possible—then praying we’d have enough to last the week.
Having a warm meal at night quickly went from being a given to a godsend. I still remember the hours my dad spent walking from payphone to payphone, hoping to find enough spare change for me and my brother to be able to afford the 25-cent school lunch the next day.
When I was a teenager, my dad lost his job, sending our family spiraling into poverty. My father, brother and I soon moved from SE Asia to Hawaii—but my mom was forced to stay back as she wasn’t yet a U.S. citizen
As the daughter of an immigrant and someone who depended on food stamps to survive, I refuse to stay silent as the Trump Admin tries to punish immigrant families by changing the “Public Charge” rule.

Happy 200th birthday, Illinois! Let’s celebrate by recognizing its numerous strengths, such as our world-class universities, vital agricultural producers, and rich outdoor activities.
My amendment ensures all airline passengers are entitled to dignified treatment that recognizes and supports their needs, and the transparency that will be brought by the rule change is critical to those traveling with a disability. https://t.co/84ND011d7v
After years of delays, @USDOT will finally make airlines’ wheelchair care record public record due to an amendment I wrote that became law earlier this year, allowing disabled members of the traveling public to make informed decisions when choosing an airline
I know from personal experience that a damaged wheelchair is more than a simple inconvenience – it’s a complete loss of mobility, independence and the equivalent to taking my legs away again. No air traveler should be left in the lurch, immobile on a plane.
Thinking of all those affected by this weekend's tornadoes and storms in Taylorville and across Central Illinois. Hope everyone stays safe. https://t.co/ZguOLLb8ah
Chag Sameach to all who celebrate! https://t.co/mZ2PzAOe2w
I will continue to hold this administration accountable until that happens. https://t.co/iBiO6Geq1X
Veterans did their jobs and performed their missions with honor. It’s critical that VA makes sure they get the benefits they rightfully earned—including paying them back with interest plus any penalties they may have incurred.
...which has helped our country become more inclusive and made it possible for people of all abilities to participate in society and lead full, meaningful lives. We will honor President Bush’s decades of public service this week when he lies in state at the Capitol Rotunda.
RIP to a great statesman who guided our nation through challenging times and the end of the Cold War. I did not agree with President Bush on every issue but will be forever grateful he signed the landmark Americans with Disabilities Act into law... https://t.co/09H0b4OQQW
#ATweetForEverything 		*special perjury edition https://t.co/foKyYdDviy
It’s long past time for us to come together again and pass pragmatic, bipartisan and commonsense legislation (that’s already written) to finally do something to help end this epidemic of needless gun violence.
25 years ago today both parties came together to make Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act law, enacting several reasonable reforms to protect Americans from gun violence.
Pleased I had the opportunity to meet with members of the Stop Sterigenics group today and hear how they are working against toxic emissions in their community. I know we can’t take back the damage already done, but I will do all I can to help improve the situation at hand. https://t.co/oQn0X1DmBh
The Trump Administration is failing to pay tens of thousands of student Veterans their hard-earned GI bill benefits. This is absolutely shameful: our nation’s Veterans served our country with honor &amp; I will do everything I can to make sure VA makes them whole. https://t.co/koY45OIpLR
I’m proud to join @SenAmyKlobuchar in introducing this bill to finally close this needless loophole that simply incentivizes corporations to avoid paying their fair share, and hope the Senate passes it quickly. https://t.co/W75xC5qpeU
Despite Republicans’ claims that they would bring jobs back to America, it’s clear the GOP Tax Scam is helping mega-corporations offshore jobs and costing middle-class taxpayers not only millions of dollars, but their livelihoods as well.
This bipartisan effort to raise awareness around the issue of youth homelessness will bring us one step closer to achieving that goal. https://t.co/h36qVjAW54
It is a tragedy when any child does not have a safe roof over their head in the United States. We must do everything we can to help children and families break the cycle of poverty, secure affordable housing and access to a safe and supportive home environment.
Thanks to this project, thousands of jobs for hardworking Illinoisans will be created and the region will be better positioned to compete in our modern economy.
The Elgin-O’Hare Western Access project is vital to our regional, state &amp; national transportation network &amp; I'm pleased that the Illinois Tollway Authority, Canadian Pacific Railway and Union Pacific Railway have finally come together to take this critical step today. https://t.co/xH1oyTmuRm
My new bill with @RepBillFoster, @SenatorDurbin, @RepLipinski &amp; @RepSchneider would help ensure that never happens again. More info: https://t.co/3alRvsMddF
Not only did our government fail to protect many Illinoisans from breathing in toxic ethylene oxide emissions, but they were far too slow to inform the public about the health risks they face.
I will keep working with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to make sure these bills progress through Congress.
In addition to the bipartisan support I have for my Energy Jobs for Our Heroes Act, I'm pleased today Under Secretary Menezes said DOE does not oppose my bill &amp; that he will work with my office on securing whistleblower protections for DOE employees https://t.co/HA2tTdNPey
IL leads the Midwest in clean energy jobs &amp; leads the Nation in nuclear reactors. My Energy Jobs for Our Heroes Act &amp; @ENERGY and Nuclear Regulatory Commission Whistleblower Act are vitally important to my state &amp; I’m proud both are closer to becoming law https://t.co/TKJ3X9Y3sA

As if it wasn’t bad enough for Trump to waste millions of taxpayer $ &amp; force American troops to be away from their families over Thanksgiving just for a PR stunt,now he wants to waste more $ on it &amp; make sure they don’t see their children &amp; spouses over the winter holidays either https://t.co/HuTw8yfl3L

Just as picking up a rifle to defend our country is American Service, so is delivering water filters to communities afflicted by lead-contaminated water, picking up a stick of chalk to teach low-income children or a hammer to rebuild homes devastated by natural disasters.

As our nation approaches the 75th anniversary of the end of World War II, it’s important we continue to remember the tremendous sacrifices made by our Veterans during this perilous time for our country.
This is entirely the wrong response. We should be immediately and comprehensively addressing the impacts of climate change. We don’t have time to deny its existence like Donald Trump is doing. https://t.co/9ntnNDpjHh
It’s been nearly 2 decades since we last passed an AUMF. Congress owes these families a debate about a new AUMF to lay out the parameters of their mission and acknowledge we have our troop’s backs and support their mission.
My heart goes out to the families of the American servicemembers who lost their lives in Afghanistan in recent days. Too many Americans don’t realize we're still at war in Afghanistan 17 years later or that families continue to sacrifice their loved ones. https://t.co/Ou0RnqKgk2
I will oppose any judicial nominee who worked to prevent African Americans from exercising this fundamental right to vote.
Actions should have consequences. Thomas Farr’s work on behalf of a racist political campaign that engaged in outrageous voter suppression disqualifies him from receiving a lifetime appointment to the Federal Bench.

This entire deployment has been a waste of taxpayer $ and a complete misuse of our military. One of the essential things that separate us from autocrats is our military’s independence from politics.

The important thing isn’t how you serve. It’s that you’re willing to serve in the first place. That’s why I’m reintroducing my 21st Century American Service Act, ensuring every young American wishing to engage in service can, regardless of tax bracket or background.
American service isn’t limited to just picking up a rifle to defend our democracy. Service also means picking up a soup spoon to feed the less fortunate, a piece of chalk to teach low-income kids or a hammer to rebuild a home destroyed by a wildfire.
Happy Birthday to my good friend and colleague, @SenatorDurbin https://t.co/rY9Itjl6ZQ
That’s why I joined @SenBlumenthal in taking him to court for accepting #emoluments from the Saudi Royal family and other foreign governments: https://t.co/YW9BcnuqBU
No President should ever put their own bank account ahead of our country, and Trump must be held accountable for violating the Constitution.
Our Founders knew that allowing ANY President to accept foreign government gifts would invite corruption, such as Saudi Arabia keeping Trump Chicago afloat and increasing Saudi dollars spent there by 169%: https://t.co/GQ6fhpDI8Z
Trump’s decision to advance propaganda on behalf of the Saudi King and Crown Prince is a stunning demonstration of why our Founders wisely sought to place limits on accepting gifts from foreign royals in the very text of our Constitution: https://t.co/lEk6wj0fdZ
Donald Trump’s unquestioned loyalty and devotion to the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia betrays American values and the rule of law. https://t.co/kW2kw1NtYM
Current @EPA rules allow companies like Sterigenics to pump cancer-causing chemicals into our air, so we’re asking the EPA to revise their safety standards, which are woefully inadequate.

To help fix this problem&amp;protect the 1.5 million jobs the Great Lakes support, @SenatorDurbin&amp;I introduced legislation to ban discharges of untreated sewage into the Great Lakes, provide funding for cleanup efforts&amp;help ensure our water is clean throughout the Great Lakes region
Roughly 22 billion gallons of untreated sewage and storm water are discharged into the Great Lakes each year, threatening the health and livelihoods of the tens of millions of Americans who depend on it as their source for drinking water.

My heart goes out to the far too many who’ve already lost loved ones to these terrible fires throughout California + to every family that’s still in harm’s way. And to our incredible first responders: thank you—you have my deepest gratitude, as always.

ICYMI: Our country can never repay the debt we owe our Veterans, but it’s on us to try. It’s on us to make sure we don’t just salute them on Veterans Day, but honor them on the other 364 days of the year, too: https://t.co/VtdpL9nHML
I was quite literally in pieces, but my buddies risked their lives and refused to leave me behind. Every day I think about what they did for me and what I can do to repay them. Making sure I don’t let them down is what drives me to do everything I can for our Veterans and troops.
Today is my Alive Day, the anniversary of the day I almost died but didn’t. On this day 14 years ago, an RPG tore through the cockpit of the helicopter I was flying over Iraq, taking my legs and partial use of my right arm with it.
After today’s ceremony, I was also able to present Mike Scheidt, the grandson of a brave American hero that served in WWII, with a Purple Heart and a Bronze Star that his late grandfather Francis earned for his sacrifice and valor in uniform https://t.co/YyDy8iTrZF
To each of them, to all my fellow Veterans and all of their families, thank you from the bottom of my heart for your service and sacrifice. God bless you, God bless our troops in harm’s way today and God bless the United States of America.
Such a privilege to be at today’s City of Chicago Veterans Day Commemoration Ceremony to celebrate, thank and honor the brave men and women who sacrifices and puts their own lives on the line to protect our democracy. https://t.co/F8oqeaK4MR
The bipartisan Veterans Small Business Enhancement Act I introduced would help Veterans access resources to expand economic opportunity and create jobs throughout the nation. I hope the Senate acts on this legislation soon.

It’s time we build on the foundation the Higher Education Act created and pass legislation like the America’s College Promise Act and make higher education more affordable for all.
I put myself through college with student loans, grants, and waitressing and I’m still paying off my student loans today. The cost of higher education is unattainable and unreasonable.
43 years ago today the Higher Education Act was signed into law, giving millions of Americans financial assistance and opening the opportunity for students to follow their dreams and passions.
But only one man controls whether I, and my colleagues, will get a chance to vote. That is the Senate Majority Leader. He doesn’t have to vote yes on these bills, but I hope he will do the right thing in simply allowing us to finally debate and vote on these life-saving measures.
We can do all these things and in the process, we will also strengthen the Second Amendment by making sure only law-abiding Americans can legally purchase a firearm.
It also includes voting yes on strengthening penalties for illegal firearms trafficking, lying on federal forms and closing absurd loopholes in the law.
This includes voting yes to expand the coverage of background checks, improve the NICS system, make it more difficult for dangerous individuals to obtain firearms and outlaw weapons of war.
Commonsense bills to end this sort of violence are already written. I am ready to vote to pass them today, tomorrow, whenever.
My heart goes out to all the victims, friends, families and first responders impacted by the horrific #BorderLineShooting in #ThousandOaks last night. Needless mass killings like this will not stop without action, and it is long past time for Congress to say #Enough.

In light of similar behavior re: the continuing Legionnaires’ disease crisis that's taken the lives of 14 of our state’s heroes @ Illinois Veterans Home Quincy, it’s also becoming apparent that the Rauner admin habitually puts PR above the health&amp;well-being of the ppl of Illinois

The Administration is long overdue in upholding its promise to address the lead crisis, and they must also provide transparency as to why they pushed out a renowned leader in children’s environmental health.
This highly-respected pediatrician and epidemiologist is exactly the type of non-partisan career official that Americans deserve on the job working to protect their public health.
And now there are reports that the @EPA may have sidelined a renowned children’s health official who was working on that report, at taxpayer expense, in order to delay or prevent its release.
More than a year after the Trump Administration held a “lead summit” and created a task force focused on developing a strategy to address our nation’s lead crisis, they still haven’t released their report on lead poisoning. https://t.co/EJLnjMjDLf

When our Veterans return home from service, they deserve our full support in their transition into civilian life, and that includes supporting efforts to build and manage a small business. Our nation should be doing much more to help our Veterans
And if Saudi Arabia involvement in this tragedy is confirmed (as seems incredibly likely), the United States must immediately reevaluate the nature and extent of our relationship with this regime.
Whether or not the Saudi regime admits involvement in #Khashoggi’s brutal killing, US officials should strongly reconsider attending next week’s Future Investment Initiative ("Davos in the Desert") in Riyadh.
The only reason US officials should be in Saudi Arabia right now is to get the truth, not give #MBS and the Saudi regime the moral cover they need to maintain legitimacy.
Donald Trump’s willingness to accept the Saudi regime’s denials of any involvement in the disappearance of @WashingtonPost journalist Jamal #Khanshoggi despite overwhelming evidence to the contrary emboldens authoritarians, dictators and human rights abusers around the globe. https://t.co/HWKw5awmc3

This announcement from AG Sessions is yet another item in a long list of counterproductive efforts from an Administration that seems more focused on pandering to its base w/hateful policies than actually reducing crime &amp; improving police relations with the communities they serve.
...to urging the use of long-discredited and likely unconstitutional "stop and frisk" tactics that only hurt community relations and make stopping crime harder.
The Trump Administration has been out of step with the needs of the people of Chicago and Illinois since the very start, from withholding federal violence prevention funding in order to force the implementation of misguided and counterproductive policing strategies... https://t.co/VX3RsDsora
The disappearance of #JamalKhashoggi is a grim reminder that journalists are often targeted by threats &amp; violence while working to shine a light on corruption.

1 yr ago, Hurricane Maria made landfall in Puerto Rico &amp; the US Virgin Islands. Parts of Puerto Rico have not recovered &amp; many families are still living in makeshift shelters, but Donald Trump is spending his time denying the reality that nearly 3,000 Americans died.
We’ve GOT to find ways for every mom-to-be &amp; new mom to access good, affordable health care so that no other woman dies a preventable death on what should be the most special day of her life. My piece for @FortuneMagazine on how we can—and must—do better: https://t.co/WhezUYXXu4
B/c I’ve seen the stats: America is the ONLY developed nation whose rate of women dying from pregnancy-related causes is still rising, with 60% of these deaths deemed preventable. Meanwhile, the numbers for women of color are somehow even worse. That’s heartbreaking—and shameful.
When I gave birth to Maile this past April, I became the first Senator to have a child while serving in office. But through my nine months of pregnancy—and my time in labor—I wasn’t thinking about making history. I was thinking about staying healthy. (thread)

I will forever treasure the privilege of working with him in the Senate, even if it was only for a short time. I hope the heights he reached &amp; the life he led can be a lesson to us all about the power of perseverance and the ability of every American to overcome any challenge.
Today, I said my final goodbye to an American hero, U.S. Senator John McCain, as he laid in state at the U.S. Capitol. John’s perseverance through years of torture and solitary confinement taught those of us recovering warriors at Walter Reed that we too could overcome anything.
I’m going to keep working to end the hunger epidemic and help make sure that no other parent has to collect change from telephone booths to feed their kids.
The FSA was a huge step in the right direction &amp; families like mine were better equipped to survive b/c of it. But we still haven’t solved this issue. Even now there are 40m+ Americans who still struggle with hunger, including 25% of the Veterans who served in Afghanistan &amp; Iraq.
No child should have to wake up unsure if they’ll be able to eat that day. No parent should have to stay up at night wondering how they’ll possibly be able to both put food on the table and pay the heating bill.
I remember anxiously waiting for my dad to tell us whether he’d found enough spare change left in public phone booths for me and my brother to be able to afford the 25 cent school lunch the next day.
To this day, I remember going to the grocery store with my parents and counting out the last five $1 food stamps to buy as much white bread and bologna as possible—then praying that we’d have enough to last the week.
I know what it’s like to have to struggle for every bite of food. After my dad lost his job when I was a teenager, food stamps helped keep me, my brother and my parents from going to bed hungry—and for that I’m forever grateful.
54 years today, LBJ signed the #FoodStampAct into law, helping change the lives of families down and out on their luck who’d previously been forced to choose between paying rent and paying for groceries. 1/

Judge Kavanaugh appears to have participated in a dark chapter of our nation’s history during the Bush Admin’s use of torture and cruel, inhumane treatment of prisoners – and he misled the Senate about it when he testified UNDER OATH in 2006.

I will forever treasure the privilege of working with John McCain in the Senate—even if it was only for a short time—and I will be forever grateful for the sacrifices he made in service to the greatest country the world has ever known.
His integrity and commitment to putting country above all else as an elected official is an example I have tried to embrace during the comparatively short time I have had the honor of holding political office.
He joked that he and I both flew into a missile and that didn’t take much skill. It’s what you do afterwards that matters. His unyielding optimism showed me there was a way to continue serving my country and to advance the core values of the nation that we both fought to protect.
His refusal to give up in the face of adversity inspired me when I was a mission-less helicopter pilot with no legs recovering at Walter Reed. In fact, I met him there for the first time when he visited us Wounded Warriors.
Throughout his life – as a Naval Aviator, a Prisoner of War who endured years of torture, a Congressman, and a six-term Senator – John repeatedly showed how anything is possible when armed with determination, a deep sense of patriotism and an unbreakable will.

The LGBTQ community has long suffered from inadequate resources and underrepresentation, in part due to the Census not collecting data on sexual orientation or gender identity.
There’s an easy way to do that: The House is 2 signatures away from passing a discharge petition to force a vote on legislation that’d protect #Dreamers from deportation. Those who claim to care about these young Americans should prove it by signing their names. #ProtectDreamers
Six years ago today, #DACA changed the lives of nearly 800,000 young immigrants who were American in every way but on paper. Dreamers embody the best of America—and now it’s on each of us to defend them from the President’s heartless attacks.

When given the chance to condemn Russia’s actions, Donald Trump refused again &amp; again. He instead suggested a false moral equivalence between America &amp; Russia, a nation that invaded &amp; annexed a portion of a sovereign country against international law, shot down...
Just days after the indictments of 12 Russian military officials for their attacks on our country during the 2016 election, Trump is not only willing to let Vladimir Putin off the hook, he actually holds America responsible for allowing the attacks to happen
This is a man who wants to work closely with our fiercest adversaries and believes our allies in the European Union are our foes, but refuses to believe the consensus of his entire intelligence community about Russian interference in the election and its continued threat

He delivered a speech *last year* arguing that late Justice Rehnquist’s dissenting opinion in the Roe case was right https://t.co/koalAZ3hXO
Though some are trying to convince Americans that Judge Kavanaugh will support precedent &amp; hasn’t definitively ruled on #RoevWade, make no mistake: he opposes it
His opinion would have allowed the government to use delay tactics to prevent women and girls from controlling what happens to their own body. Or, in other words, he drafted a (losing) legal argument that would have forced a child to have a baby https://t.co/zODoJCqbLH
He disagreed with, and wrote a dissent against, a court ruling that the punishment for entering this country illegally cannot be “forcing a child to have a baby”
I’m spending a lot of time reviewing Judge Kavanaugh’s rulings to see if he has the temperament and wisdom—and whether he has shown the independence needed of our next #SupremeCourt Justice. Very disappointed by what I’m seeing:
Patriotic Americans have defended our democracy against foreign adversaries—and won—since our founding. We can do so again if we all put country ahead of party as we confront Russian aggression in this new generation and on this new battleground
Donald Trump must immediately cancel his planned summit with Vladimir #Putin until #Russia demonstrates its willingness to come back into the community of nations that respect the rule of law, legal norms and democratic institutions
We must bring to bear the full force of U.S. sanctions against #Russia as well as consider their expansion against broader sectors of the Russian economy
Today’s indictments and Russia’s actions transcend political party and should trouble all Americans and democracies around the world. Russia must be held accountable for their outrageous, unprecedented attacks on our nation
These indictments could not be clearer. American democracy was the target of a careful, systematic and intentional attack aimed at undermining the bedrock of our democracy: free and open elections without foreign interference https://t.co/sklauiOs7S

Passing the #FAMILYAct and ensuring access to #PaidFamilyLeave would make both American families and the American economy stronger
Our nation’s lack of #PaidFamilyLeave has long been a barrier for women entering and staying in the workforce - 61% of whom list family responsibilities as their reason for not working
Hardworking ppl deserve the #FAMILYAct – the only #PaidFamilyLeave proposal that covers every working American w/o excluding medical leave or military caregiver leave,&amp;it doesn’t speed up Social Security’s insolvency like a proposal some colleagues support https://t.co/ZZA56ec5fr
Any family leave proposal that cuts social security benefits or excludes family and military caregiving is not #RealPaidLeave
Millions of men and women across the country don’t have access to #PaidFamilyLeave, meaning they could be forced to choose between taking care of a child or loved one and losing their paycheck, or even their job
We cannot allow President Trump to pursue his goal of, in his own words, overturning #RoevWade. We need to make sure that the next #SCOTUS Justice will protect the Constitutional rights of all women &amp; protect the ability of families like mine to have children

If Trump succeeds, it won’t only affect people like me who could be prevented from having children through IVF; the impacts will be felt by everyone. Whoever replaces Justice Kennedy will play a critical role in the lives of all women and every single American #SCOTUSpick
We can’t ignore the reality that Donald Trump wants to take us back to a time when insurers could refuse coverage to ppl w/ pre-existing conditions or that he promised to only nominate Justices who would put the government back in between women and their doctors #SCOTUSpick
The newfound urgency to fill Justice Kennedy’s #SCOTUS seat from many of the same people who refused to even consider President Obama’s nominee is transparent opportunism that represents everything Americans hate most about politics today.
This is yet another sign that under Donald Trump’s presidency, America has lost its way on the global stage and—once again—it comes at the expense of mothers and their children.
Breastfeeding plays a critical role in children’s development &amp; helps reduce the risk of diseases for children &amp; mothers alike.

This administration’s actions are distressing and awful, but the world is watching how we, as a people, respond to the thousands of terrified, innocent children wondering if they’ll ever see their parents again. We can’t give up.
That’s the reality. There’s only one person who can end this horror with a single call, and that’s Donald Trump. He can blame whoever he wants, but the fact that he won’t make that call should tell you all you need to know about his true priorities
Facts are important. Reality is reality. The reality is that the Trump administration is choosing to rip children &amp; infants away from their parents and then holding them hostage. They may think it's a political winner or a game, but they're playing with innocent children's lives
Pay attention when you hear this, because it’s the Trump administration admitting that the reason they’re doing this is because they want to send a message. And if they have to commit child abuse on several thousand innocent souls to send that message, they’re ok with that
Excuse 6: “It would be a tough deterrent.” Someone might want to tell @SecNielsen that AG Sessions and WH Chief of Staff Kelly believe this, because she said it wasn’t yesterday. This is probably the most accurate, though inhumane, excuse I’ve heard
Excuse 5: “You have to take the children away,” – Trump himself. Um… No. Just no.
Excuse 4.1, defending turning away asylum-seekers: "We are not turning them away. We are saying...we do not have the resources at this particular moment in time." THEN MAYBE STOP WASTING RESOURCES TEARING FAMILIES APART AND IMPRISONING TERRIFIED CHILDREN!
Excuse 4: “If you are seeking asylum, go to a port of entry. You do not need to break the law of the United States to seek asylum.” Not only cruel &amp; heartless, it's also not an option for many asylum-seekers who are being turned away from ports of entry: https://t.co/XN5x5uddiJ
Excuse 3: “We do not have a policy of separating families at the border.” If only wishing made it so, then they wouldn't need excuses 1 or 2? 3 days before @SecNielsen lied about this, AG Sessions admitted this policy exists in a speech: https://t.co/NjQUWFTJ0G
Excuse 2: “#CHANGETHELAWS” We want to, but even if we do it doesn’t excuse the immoral &amp; inhumane way the Trump administration is treating kids. If Congress acts today, this administration will still be responsible for the inexcusable child abuse that’s taken place in recent wks
Excuse 1: “The Democrats have to change their law.” Even if it were true that such a law existed (it isn't &amp; it doesn't) or that Dems wrote it (also a lie), Trump’s party still controls both chambers in Congress—and therefore controls what votes take place
A quick guide to the Trump administration’s ever-changing, contradictory and false excuses/outright lies for ripping innocent children away from their parents and then holding them hostage:
Today, we celebrate #Juneteenth2018 &amp; the abolition of slavery in America. We’ve come far as a nation in advancing civil rights, but we have much further to go to ensure every American—no matter their race or ethnicity—receives full justice &amp; equality

The Senate must defeat Haspel’s nomination &amp; send a message to the rest of the world about the American values I fought to defend &amp; our nation’s commitment to condemning torture &amp; promoting human rights around the globe
The torture program not only compromised our nation’s values, it helped recruit terrorists and put a much larger target on the backs of U.S. troops and diplomats working in the world’s most dangerous places
Torture is illegal, immoral and it does not work. As @SenJohnMcCain frequently says, torture is not about our enemies—it’s about us. We are a nation of laws and believe that all people, no matter how hateful or harmful, are entitled to human dignity
Haspel’s defenders suggest “she was just following orders” in directing the destruction of evidence of torture. That defense wouldn’t have protected me on the battlefield if the orders were illegal, and it shouldn’t protect a nominee to be CIA director
Haspel did not simply participate in torture—she supported brutal interrogations, ran a CIA black site in Thailand where at least 1 detainee was waterboarded &amp; then attempted to obstruct justice by eliminating evidence of this torture

#Haspel promised not to allow any CIA employee to resume torturing detainees. Does her promise also apply to employees of private contractors being paid by CIA (with your tax dollars)?
Fear may be an accurate explanation for CIA torture, but it must never excuse or exonerate those who violated American values and principles by torturing individuals in U.S. custody #TortureIsDisqualifying
#Haspel may not have created the CIA program that led to our country torturing detainees, but she disqualified herself from leading the agency by participating in it, failing to oppose torture and attempting to cover up the brutality #TortureIsDisqualifying

I didn’t understand then why he made us stay after school redoing work so many times each week, but I do now. The kids he kept late were all poor kids like me. He was feeding us—and doing it with his public school teacher’s salary
“Aw, kids, I’m so sorry that I kept you here so late for extra work. Here’s $10, go to Taco Bell, it’s 2 for 99 cents—get something to eat before you go home.” As 16-yr-olds who thought we knew everything, we loved him but thought he was incompetent because he always kept us late
It didn’t always though. Luckily for me, sometimes my English teacher would keep a bunch of us after school—then after a while he’d reach into his own pocketbook and say something like:
When I was in high school, my dad lost his job &amp; my family had to rely on food stamps. I still remember going to the grocery store and counting out the last five brown $1 food stamps to get some baloney &amp; white bread, praying it would last through the week

National service is an issue that is near&amp;dear to my heart&amp;to my staff’s hearts, too. That’s why I intro'd the 21st Century American Service Act in 2016, which would expand service opportunities to ensure all young people who want to serve their community have the chance to do so
On this day 9 years ago the Kennedy Serve America Act, which reauthorized &amp; expanded @Americorps, was signed into law by President Obama. One of the best things we can do for our country is give back through national service—either in or out of uniform
If Trump truly wants to help keep our streets safe &amp; support community safety efforts, he should start by ensuring Chicago &amp; other cities receive grant funding to fight crime &amp; gun violence

But Donald Trump’s decision tonight would not only prevent qualified servicemembers from protecting this country at a time when we can’t afford to turn anyone away, it also goes against our nation’s values of inclusion and equality. It is blatantly discriminatory.

Who we confirm for these posts will send a message to the rest of the world on America’s commitment, or lack thereof, to condemning torture &amp; promoting human rights
Trump’s new nominee to be Secretary of State, Mike Pompeo, has not expressed any moral opposition to torture. His nominee to be @CIA Director, Gina Haspel, has done much worse (incl directly supervising the torture of detainees &amp; helping destroy video evidence of those abuses)
Rather than taking serious steps to ensure stability or fill our diplomatic corps, once again Donald Trump has chosen chaos over the kind of leadership the American people desperately need and deserve

If you don't live with a disability, you might not think of #ADA violations as significant at 1st glance, but I assure you they're significant for those of us who do live with disabilities
I understand that not everyone thinks about these things because for most of my adult life I didn’t either. But the truth is that everyone is just one bad day away from needing accessible options the #ADA requires to help them get around
Being unable to independently enter a movie theater, store, hotel or restaurant is not only humiliating, it limits the freedom to pursue certain jobs, access necessary services &amp; enjoy basic conveniences that most Americans don’t think twice about
Supporters of #HR620 don’t deny that they’re violating the law—they just resent being sued for “minor” #ADA infractions. But an incline that is “only” a few degrees too steep, or an entrance that is “only” a few inches high, can determine if I’m able to access an area w/out help
THREAD on #HR620 ↓		Ever since I lost my legs when an RPG tore thru the cockpit of my Blackhawk I was flying over Iraq, getting around has been difficult—even w/the #ADA, I can’t always enter public spaces &amp; have to spend a lot of time planning how to get frm 1 place to the next

We need our commander-in-chief to change course, try to forge bipartisan agreements on issues like immigration, and present the American people with a more positive and inclusive message that moves us forward as a nation. Tonight, President Trump failed on each of these counts.
He made little mention of smaller communities that he promised to help rebuild during his campaign. He failed to propose an infrastructure plan&amp;focused only on public-private partnerships, which would force new tolls&amp;taxes on middle-class families&amp;fall seriously short of needs.
&amp;I hoped he'd propose a bipartisan plan to lift the threat of deportation Dreamers face b/c of him. Instead, he engaged in more reckless rhetoric that divides instead of unites—&amp;that already caused countless diplomatic crises&amp;brought us2the brink of nuclear war w/ #northKorea.
I hoped he would present a serious infrastructure plan that makes the investments we desperately need to rebuild our crumbling roads, tunnels and bridges. I hoped he would offer a plan to rebuild rural communities that have been left behind like Cairo, Illinois.
With the world watching, I hoped Donald Trump would finally remember some of the promises he made to the American people and display the leadership needed to unify this nation.
By the way—does the President know there are people from Muslim-majority countries with similar stories—and a similar yearning for freedom—as Seong-ho? If so, maybe now would be a good time to reconsider his racist #MuslimBan?
And why did he sign a Presidential Proclamation that blocks people like Seong-ho from coming here. The proclamation literally says: “The entry into the United States of nationals of North Korea as immigrants and nonimmigrants is hereby suspended.” https://t.co/8Eima4x4Sc
What I’m confused by is why the Trump administration would hold up this testament when his “merit-based” immigration proposal would prevent people like Ji Seong-ho from coming to our country.
I agree with Trump’s assessment of Seong-ho—and was honored to meet with him while in Korea last month—he is truly a testament to the human spirit and any country would be honored to call him a citizen.
Trump just recognized north Korean defector Ji Seong-ho in his #SOTU as "a testament to the yearning of every human sould to live in freedom." https://t.co/HcfsbBzrWK

In the words of Dr. Thomas, the Cairo community doesn’t need a hand out – they need a helping hand. We're both hoping President Trump will remember his campaign promise to help forgotten communities like Cairo in the #SOTU tonight

Ryan, McConnell&amp;Trump could address these concerns w/bipartisan Republican-written bills that solve each of these problems&amp;they know it. That they haven’t—even though they control all levers of gov't—jeopardizes not just our military, but the very people we took an oath to serve.
...and it leaves hundreds of thousands of Dreamers in a state of uncertainty. Enough is enough. I didn’t spend 23 years in the military going through multiple deployments just to weaken our national security, hurt our troops and kick the can down the road again.
I’m listening to them, and I wish Donald Trump and the Republicans who control both houses of Congress would as well. In addition to seriously harming our Armed Forces, this bill fails to adequately support Veterans or fund community health centers...
This bill deprives 45k servicemembers in Illinois—&amp;the whole of our military—of the certainty needed to protect&amp;defend our nation. Even the Pentagon warned this week about the "wasteful and destructive" national security ramifications of failing to provide long-term funding. https://t.co/T5jwaqqGbG

There are no truer American values than to work hard to accomplish your goals and to have the ability to fully contribute to society. It’s time for Congress to recognize #Dreamers’ contributions by passing the #DreamActNow
It’s clear that our businesses and communities benefit and thrive from the work ethic and perseverance that #Dreamers like Christian possess
Thanks to #DACA, Christian was able to secure a job right after graduation, &amp; after just 2 years she reached number one in sales at her company nationwide #DACAworks
Christian’s hard work payed off, &amp; she was admitted to @NIUlive on a scholarship. In 2015, Christian became the first person in her family to graduate with a bachelor’s degree
One of America’s—&amp; Illinois’—#Dreamers is Christian. Brought to the U.S. when she was just 6 years old, Christian quickly excelled at school. She knew, in her own words, “education is the way to a better life” #AmericanDreamer https://t.co/pIEOpzWQ27

This bill is irresponsible, and I am unbelievably disappointed Senate Republicans are rushing through their proposal to give permanent tax cuts to those who don’t need them, while sticking working families with the bill. We know better, and Republicans should know better.
Middle-class Americans and small businesses—not mega-corporations and large pass-through entities like the Trump Organization—deserve a break, and it is so disheartening to see Wall Street once again benefiting at the expense of Main Street.
Congress should be focused on helping working families and middle-class Americans. Unfortunately, the Senate GOP's "tax reform" legislation would double-tax millions of Illinoisans and leave small businesses at a competitive disadvantage to mega-corporations. https://t.co/L5AFkyJEG1
This account must include whether President Trump directed Flynn or had knowledge of his actions.
Whether Flynn delayed critical anti-ISIL coalition military operations or sought to undermine U.S. sanctions against Russian adversaries, Americans deserve a full &amp; transparent accounting of his actions to understand why he recklessly lied to Federal law enforcement agents.
As one of Trump’s senior advisors, Michael Flynn was in a position of significant influence and every American should be alarmed if reports that he abused his position to betray our nation on behalf of foreign interests are validated.
Today’s guilty plea by President Trump’s former National Security Advisor Michael Flynn admitting he willfully and knowingly lied to the FBI is extremely troubling—and it is not normal. https://t.co/8VjbXJM0Rh
We owe each and every Veteran a great debt. The least we can do is ensure our heroes are able to receive the quality education they deserve—this bill threatens that goal

Extremely disappointed by Steven Bradbury’s confirmation to @USDOT. An unprincipled lawyer, such as Mr. Bradbury, paired with an unprincipled executive, such as Mr. Trump, is a dangerous combination
Mr Bradbury is a deeply flawed nominee and he is not fit to work in this – or any – Administration, and I can’t oppose his nomination strongly enough
When you’re stuck bleeding in a helicopter behind enemy lines, you hope and pray that, if the enemy finds you first, they treat you humanely
And more importantly, these justifications do not protect our troops who are sitting on the floor of a P.O.W. cell
I can tell you from firsthand experience, as someone who has bled behind enemy lines, legal gymnastics are a luxury not afforded our men and women in the field
Our men and women in uniform are taught:	 	1. The laws of armed conflict	2. The proper way to care for detainees	3. The importance of acting in accordance with American values	 	Mr Bradbury’s actions at the Justice Department undermine that education
Let me be clear: Mr Bradbury didn’t make America safer, and he certainly didn’t make our brave men and women in uniform safer
Mr Bradbury’s willingness to aid and abet torture demonstrates a failure of moral character that makes him dangerous to the American people and to our troops, regardless of the agency he serves
The torture memos represent a dark period in our nation’s recent history that we must never repeat

Mylan's business practices not only put the lives of kids across America at risk, but also cost American taxpayers hundreds of millions of $

@POTUS … and at the same time you're trying to make their healthcare cost more and cover less here at home
@POTUS It's indefensible for you to use those costs as a reason to deny healthcare to those who've risked their lives for our country…
@POTUS Experts say the costs you mention are at most just .13% of the military budget *for healthcare specifically* — not 13% or 1.3%, but .13%

So honored to deliver the commencement address at @GWtweets #Congratulations https://t.co/zlN8H7Eh6R
RT @GWtweets: Sen. Tammy Duckworth on persevering: https://t.co/pAOfYLh9kQ
Put yourself out there. Don’t be a “timid soul who knows neither victory nor defeat.” Congrats, class of 2017–it’s time to get in the arena
I am calling on every @GWtweets student to serve. Get loud, get active. Make a difference in your city, in your state, in your country
@GWtweets President Roosevelt understood that well. It’s about trying. It’s about doing. Don’t be afraid of failure, be afraid of never tasting it
@GWtweets But we aren't successful in spite of our challenges, we're successful because of our will to overcome them
@GWtweets There will be hard times &amp; moments you feel discouraged. Remember Pres Roosevelt’s words: "there is no effort without error &amp; shortcoming"
@GWtweets I want the @GWtweets class of 2017 to remember this moment, the tenacity, diligence, work ethic &amp; dedication it took for them to get here
Over &amp; over, the students of @GWtweets have proven to be civically-engaged students, showing leadership in &amp; out of the political arena
My story has a few more years than GWU students, but I’m not really that different. I know each &amp; every student can get into the arena, too
After I got out of Walter Reed, I went to the VA, I ran for Congress and then I won my seat in the Senate
I realized that maybe I was done serving in combat, but I could see the next step in my life’s path still meant serving my fellow Veterans
After every time I couldn’t do something, after every day when I didn’t know how I’d make it to the next, I made the choice not to give up
With the help of my family, friends and fellow servicemembers at Walter Reed, I began my recovery. It was anything but easy
I was quite literally in pieces, but my buddies wouldn’t give up on me. They refused to leave me behind&amp; I survived to serve my nation again
Nov 12, '04 is my “Alive Day"–the day that I almost died but didn't–when an RPG tore thru the cockpit of the helicopter I was flying in Iraq
I’ve had plenty of moments when I thought of giving up – moments when I thought I had been defeated
Successful people didn’t make it because they never failed, they made it because they never gave up
Teddy Roosevelt once said, "the credit belongs to the man who is in the arena... because there is no effort without error &amp; shortcoming"
My message to all students—wherever you fall on the political spectrum—is to get involved, not discouraged

We're still the greatest nation in the world, and if anyone has the capacity to overcome the challenges of today, it’s the American people
We know we still have a lot work to do as a country, but let us not lose sight of the core values that make our improbable union possible
Our nation wouldn’t be as strong as it is today w/out the countless individuals who sacrificed to build it—this is what makes American great
Progress is never a sure thing—it's won through the toil of our Servicemembers, Vets, manufacturers, farmers, teachers&amp; civil rights leaders
I know that the path forward for our country cannot include—does not include—turning our backs on the shared values that built our nation
Some may try to convince us the path forward is less engagement with the world, less acceptance of others and less investment in ourselves
We might get knocked down, but the America I know—that I fought for and love—does not give up. It's the American way
From our founding, the US has faced stark divisions and challenges. But through each trial, we have emerged a more perfect union
America wasn’t founded as the dominant economic and military force and leader of the free world — the American people built that
Falling victim to fear&amp; demagoguery will only ensure a weaker America for our children, &amp; that’s not a future I want for my 2yr-old daughter
These shared values that have helped us to strive toward that more perfect union the Constitution’s framers envisioned
Though we've occasionally made choices that don't reflect our best selves, we're the greatest nation in the world due to our ideals &amp; values

Lead in our water supplies is a serious problem for kids in IL which is why we need an #EPA that will proactively prevent crises like #Flint
As a mom of a toddler, I was shocked that #Pruitt was unaware that there is no safe level of lead for children at his confirmation hearing
We should be encouraging the use of USmade renewable fuel&amp;protecting #RFS not appointing people like #Pruitt who helped big oil sue the #EPA
As someone who fought to defend this nation, I’ve seen firsthand the price we pay for our dangerous dependence on foreign oil
