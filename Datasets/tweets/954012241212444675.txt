@lancelout @Krebitz_ @RoamingMil That, imo, is another part that is worryingly missing in most of today's democratic culture, and would address your issue with some citizens being "sheltered and dissociated from reality."
@lancelout @Krebitz_ @RoamingMil ...volunteering at a homeless shelter would ignore the other vital part of democracy, which is government and politics, and in order to get anything done there and lead your community to improvement, it is necessary to learn vital empathic, discussionary, and persuasive skills.
@lancelout @Krebitz_ @RoamingMil That's fairly close minded to think that citizens via the proper culture and heavy participation in the community, are unable to develop those qualities on their own (with regards to being born &amp; raised in the community, immigration is a separate subject). Additionally, only...
@lancelout @Krebitz_ @RoamingMil ...that community service is viewed more as a punishment, and less as a responsibility taken up by a citizen proud of helping their community.
@lancelout @Krebitz_ @RoamingMil ...cultural elements of citizen participation and self-rule. There are qualities that are genuinely lacking in modern democracies, namely those that strengthen communal bonds and belonging, particpation in communal improvement, etc. It's an issue in today's political culture...
@lancelout @Krebitz_ @RoamingMil I'd hardly call a city the size of Salt Lake City in population a "town". And I never said anything about basing our system of government off of it, as Athens would never work in today's economy and culture. However, we would be foolish not to consider appropriating some of its..
@lancelout @Krebitz_ @RoamingMil ...overthrow the Demos. Arguably, the city's experience under oligarchic tyranny, especially under the oppressive Thirty, strengthened their democratic and egalitarian resolve.
@lancelout @Krebitz_ @RoamingMil ...would become law, a forerunner to the modern idea of an Upper House. The democratoc culture was also incredibly strengthened as before Antipater finally stripped Athens of all independence and its democracy, a law was passed which punished any support for or attempt to...
@lancelout @Krebitz_ @RoamingMil The staggering democracy that rebounded, arguably successfully and improved upon, from those two oligarchies.

@lancelout @Krebitz_ @RoamingMil The next 2 tweets dealt with what the main issue today is, not the voting age, but the flawed democratic culture, which a mere change in voting age won't fix.
@lancelout @Krebitz_ @RoamingMil I'm not understanding. My original point dealt with how raising the voting age to 25 would be a non-solution as it'd deprive people of a vital right in modern democracy. It'd be akin to Athens expecting its citizens to fight in the military, but shuts them up during the Assembly.

@lancelout @Krebitz_ @RoamingMil The view of activism as the only other main venue of participation is part of why current democratic culture is flawed. Any participation in government AND the community, from local up to the national level whether it be PTA meetings, food drives, opening, warming stations for...
@lancelout @Krebitz_ @RoamingMil Without that kind of high participatory culture to reinforce democratic ideals &amp; to push people to be better citizens then it doesn't matter whether the voting age is 16 or 25, the democracy is still flawed. Without that culture, I doubt even an earned citizenship would fix it
@lancelout @Krebitz_ @RoamingMil That's a fairly myopic view of democracy. Athenian participatory democracy for instance hardly rewarded laziness. It instead rewarded being an active member of the polis and practicing democracy. This was reinforced by a highly democratic &amp; highly (relatively) egalitarian culture

There are ways to argue against Trump's use of emergency powers.	This is not one of them.	Hyperbole has its occasional uses in rhetoric.	This is not one of them.	Don't mislead and fearmonger just to score political points. It just makes you look like an ass.

@peebraindk True, it's not an immediately pressing issue, but it's a potential one for the future as CO2 levels continue rising and the population keeps growing.		Also tbf the average right now is 408 ppm with regional variation (mainly with greater concentration in the Northern hemisphere)
@fche @StefanMolyneux True, the article I read implied the study was much more clear cut. Thank you very much for linking the full study though
@SoyPilled Well the issue at current discussion is the amount of CO2 in the atmosphere, not the temperature, and CO2 levels during the Medieval era were much, much lower than today		Source for image: https://t.co/Bk9uEFOtRH https://t.co/4h0OYdCBcB
@DSpunkmeyer I replied to the tweet with a link to the article I cited

Source for that: https://t.co/Um2IAMupxZ		You're also ignoring that plants today are adapted to a lower CO2 environment than those of the past
Excessive amounts of CO2 has been shown to decrease the amount of nitrogen absorbed thus lowering nutritional value (which is especially concerning w/crops like wheat and rice).		I.e. even if higher CO2 doesn't kill off plants, it'll still harm our ability to feed ourselves. https://t.co/j6Mjb3Dmuy

@xDesprin @Vile_666_ To sum classical republicanism up (imperfectly), it's close to social liberalism and socdem, but more  consistent in its arguments and has broader potential than just policy, even addressing how individuals should engage each other and how government should be structured
@xDesprin @Vile_666_ Early Republican ideals and axioms, such as freedom being defined in terms of non-domination, which is not being interfered with in am arbitrary whim (as opposed to liberalism defining freedom in terms of non-interference). Philip Petit's book Republicanism gives a good overview
@Vile_666_ @xDesprin Nuh, it's more classical republican than socdem thus making it objectively better than both dems and repubs. Catherine MaCaulay, Montesquieu, &amp; Madison &gt; Mill, Locke, and Jefferson, change my mind

The US is far more diverse than in 1943, so it makes no sense to harangue about edits that try to include a new, more diverse, generation in centuries old American Freedoms, as Rockwell did for his.		TL;DR They're pictures you dolt, get off your high horse.
The United States is always changing: socially, politically, culturally. This fact can be seen in Rockwell's own works. The Four Freedoms were made in 1943. Contrast their mood with that of Southern Justice and The Problem We All Live With from ~20 years later. https://t.co/0cPLvKArRe
Will prefers not to see it as that. He calls it "resentment", "replacement", "destruction." This is in fact an expansion. The original work remains, so it is neither "replaced" nor "destroyed." And the work's message is not restricted nor disregarded so it is not "resented."
This thread is an absolute myopic mess.

@RiverTamYDN @realwokieleaks It was upheld that Section 5 of the 14th Amendment gave Congress the power to enact legislation re voting rights, which in the Voting Rights case dealt with literacy tests, not the Equal Protection Clause (which the Court actually ruled in '59 wasn't violated by those same tests)

@StePhilbin @T__E__S__L__A I don't even know what that is. It seems his position is "densibrium", the belief that difference in density is what causes the fall and rise of different objects (never mind that density alone is meaningless without gravity to actively pull and orient the objects)
@T__E__S__L__A I mean, considering its use in calculations has enabled landing on the moon, sending probes to various planets and moons, and even sending Voyagers 1 and 2 into the deepest reaches of the solar system, I find it highly improbable that it "does not exist"
@T__E__S__L__A They would fall at roughly the same rate (the difference in mass having slight affect but not an easibly noticeable)		https://t.co/tuP0toSbdQ

@White_Fox97 Using 2 different fundamentally different items would also introduce an unknown variable that would skew results, hence why Cavendish used lead balls. You'd think a mechanical engineer would know this
@elonmusk @nichegamer Autopilot and gaming? You're spoiling us dude, and I fucking love it
@T__E__S__L__A Same charges will make them repel, but the torsion direction would be opposite of what is expected if mass attracts mass. Not to mention you've yet to explain how the balls could've obtained static charges. Was it a flaw caused by Cavendish during construction for example?
@T__E__S__L__A @CryptykAgainist Considering how often the experiment has been reproduced, including in the late 1800s when the gravity constant was found, the onus is on you to show where it is flawed and in a reproducible manner
@Punished___God @T__E__S__L__A https://t.co/k64vw3cCBD
@T__E__S__L__A Also, here are the force differences between the oceans and a head of hair https://t.co/U8XB12LtW2
@T__E__S__L__A No, how would it be independent of mass? Gravity relies on mass for any attraction to occur. I even said earlier that anything with mass is attracted to everything else with mass https://t.co/CTUryQAr2n
@T__E__S__L__A Again, it'd be far less noticeable. The tptal mass of the oceans is about 1.4x10^21 kg. Compare that with a head of hair, which could be about 250g for a massive amount of hair hanging down to the waist, and you've got a massive difference before you
@T__E__S__L__A The wire would have torsion in the incorrect direction though
@T__E__S__L__A The moon's gravity does attract your hair though, the main differences in this case is both the state of matter (liquid vs solid) and the amount of matter. A gargantuan, malleable liquid is going to be affected much more noticeably than a tiny, far less malleable solid
@T__E__S__L__A If you're really driven to find the truth and want to better endorse your ideas, wouldn't reproducing the experiment and finding the potential flaws of how it has been conducted, &amp; doing so in a reproducible manner, be the best approach?
@T__E__S__L__A But you haven't answered the question of how the balls would have differing charges causing for the attraction absent of gravity. What would have cause them to have differing static charges?
@T__E__S__L__A Yes. Anything that has mass has attraction to anything else with mass
@High_c332 True kings. RIP 🙌 https://t.co/yvsaKYa8dI
@T__E__S__L__A You know how the Cavendish experiment is supoosed to be set up. If you want to you can reproduce it yourself. As I said earlier, scientific knowledge is built off of the ability to reproduce experiments
@T__E__S__L__A The poles aren't closed off from the rest of the atmosphere though (not to mention the water currents that carry and retain heat across the globe thus having additional influence on the air currents)
@T__E__S__L__A I never said anything regarding torsion. The Cavendish experiment relies on torsion in order to even work.
@T__E__S__L__A If the whole earth were at rest and given enough time, the matter would sort itself out, but you're ignoring that earth is not a closed system. It receives energy from the sun which causes the air to shift and change with forces that are stronger than gravity
@T__E__S__L__A ...state "this oscillation should have never stopped" if it never did? Why make an erroneous claim at the end that wouldn't be true regardless of the experiement because of electromagnetic friction (the physical movement would be transformed into electricity &amp; eventually stop)? https://t.co/q4B1QVLLoA
@T__E__S__L__A This video starts off with a very flawed premise. How did the lead balls obtain static charges that allowed attraction (including in subsequent reproductions kf tge experiment)? What does a downward force have to do with a force perpendicular to it? The beam never rested so... https://t.co/ozKhXSZKqf
@doomwad765 @AntiTesla20 @washyapitts @T__E__S__L__A A more volatile liquid does make it more effective and faster, but water has been used in the past if Ben Franklin's account is accurate. https://t.co/v1OZ1U1ogC
@T__E__S__L__A In an elementary sense, density merely determines the order in which different matter settles, gravity orientates that order (since the universe has no "floor" to speak of)
@T__E__S__L__A If gravity isn't a force and density is purely how objects sort themselves, then why do planets, suns, galaxies, galaxy clusters, etc. coalesce? Wouldn't matter achieve equilibrium by spreading evenly among the universe? Why do areas such as Boötes void exist?

@doomwad765 @AntiTesla20 @washyapitts @T__E__S__L__A The liquid doesn't have to be anything special (and if it were the liquid boiling you'd see less liquid overall, which doesn't seem to happen). More likely it's just water with food coloring and the gas in the tube is being expanded by the body's heat thus pushing the liquid
@T__E__S__L__A The last bit that remains is due to various reasons such as lack of mass resulting in insufficient force, the tube being too wide for capillary action, etc. And if you don't believe this video you clearly can reproduce it yourself, after science is built off of reproducibility
@T__E__S__L__A It is not the liquid that's responding, it's the gas. As it expands from the heat it expands and pushes the liquid up with a force that counteracts gravity (hence the bubbling at the top). As the bottom cools and the gas shrinks, gravity then begins to draw the liquid back down. https://t.co/LqEa1ddqeW

If the fact that an employee witnessed election fraud is bad enough, then it shouldn't have to be mischaracterized to make it seem worse. That just hurts the pursuit of justice
...truth, and to instead mislead those near million people, is an act worthy of ridicule. Yes, rather than step up to the occasion to lead and correct a falsehood, Kirk has instead shown himself to be a man of an inferior character. The public expects more of you.

Considering @JeffKottkamp and @charliekirk11 did NOT bother to cite their source, did NOT make clear the affidavit was filed in 2016, not 2018, and since they did NOT clarify that this affidavit was not filed in support of Caldwell, BUT was instead cited by him as a reason to...
No, instead I had found the affidavit in question w/in the Caldwell v. Snipes suit (the court website only provides the first page. Full suit can be downloaded here: https://t.co/1OudRhyFsY ).		The affidavit they talk about was filed in 2016. Not 2018 as a lay reader would think. https://t.co/Z4OF1qKGmN

At 7:15 and 11 PM respectively on Nov. 9th, Kottkamp and Kirk both made these statements in regards to the Broward County situation.

@UnitersCentrist @progressnerd @__dotblake @fairvote While RCV is a better choice than those options, they are far from the only alternatives.

@UnitersCentrist @progressnerd @__dotblake @fairvote Not necessarily. Score Runoff Voting (SRV) potentially would do a much better job than RCV. In simulation it is both more representative of the electorate than RCV, &amp; provides greater voter satisfaction (both highly important qualities to the health of a democracy imo). https://t.co/mNL3FrspNN
@progressnerd @__dotblake @UnitersCentrist @fairvote Very good article, and I do agree that voting methods should be judged relative to others. Still, the idea that a method could cause a candidate to lose in an honest voting electorate that agrees with them much more strongly than other candidates doesn't sit well with me
@__dotblake @UnitersCentrist @fairvote It's been found this scenario could occur in at least 15% of competitive Ranked Choice elections. https://t.co/WrjKjuJR55
@__dotblake @UnitersCentrist @fairvote Taking this hypothetical election as an example, Left would win w/51 votes. However, if 2 Right/Left voters were to switch their preferred order, thus giving Left, the winner, higher preference, it would result in Center winning w/60 votes. https://t.co/LyF41ztqe0

@Dismine @AnnCoulter Not exactly, least as I understand it.
