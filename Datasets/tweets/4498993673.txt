@SenGillibrand Yes, it frustrates Americans when their representatives don’t listen. You are listening to the corrupt voices, not hard working taxpayers disgusted with power grabbing behavior of those in office whose heart is not to serve but to abuse power granted by trusting voters.
@SenGillibrand Americans deserve answers,accountability, and justice that will only come when people in power, including you, Gilli, learn the meaning of truth. You perpetrate a sham investigation begun by liars and cheats. Evil doers eventually become ensnared by their own trap.

@SenGillibrand @realDonaldTrump The culture of corruption has been ongoing in the democratic regime that refuses to face the fact that they lost. Face facts, Gilli. Dems have a modus operandi: accuse others of exactly what they themselves are doing. Pure evil.

@SenGillibrand @realDonaldTrump It is deeply troubling that Democrats are undermining our democratic republic by trying at every turn with lies and deceit to unseat a duly elected President.
@SenGillibrand @realDonaldTrump Gilli, denying the “credibility” of global warming is actually facing the Truth. In all our littleness we think we can be God enough to change climate? I challenge you to inquire into the false “facts.” Liars perpetuating the hoax are laughing, while fools make them very rich.
@SenGillibrand Gilli, The saddest Truth is you have wandered so far from Truth you cannot recognize it. You are lost in the morass. You know little about right, wrong, your so-called equality, justice or anything else Americans care about. “It’s All About Me, Baby” does not work in our Republic
@SenGillibrand Gilli, Are you really that clueless? Surely those who attack us at our border are not little innocents looking for asylum. Irresponsible as you are about protecting Americans, you need to resign.

@SenGillibrand Gilli, Go back and read your tweet. Try honesty. Take the log out of your own eye. Your party knows only divisiveness and you got sucked right in. Change your attitude. It will change your life. Happy Thanksgiving.
@SenGillibrand How about putting a stop to senseless rants about the NRA. In fact, why not just stop the rants, period.
@BohemianPatriot @KamalaHarris Key words being assess a problem, not be as ass and create problems. The Self serving and power hungry do not belong in the seat of power. Those seats should be reserved for citizens of integrity dedicated to protect our Constitutional Republic.
@KamalaHarris Who the hell are you, Kamala, to declare who  does and does not deserve a tax cut? Arrogance has blinded you. Those tax Dollars are confiscated from hard working Americans, including women whom you claim to champion. And you dare to say who has the right to their own money?

@SenGillibrand Anyone who has corrupted our elections by allowing illegals and the dead and out of districters to revote must be dumped from power.
@SenGillibrand Gilli, you are so wrong. Claiming your power is why we Americans are sick of your ilk. Americans have spoken when we elected this President, and we want power returned to citizenry and the corrupt swamp dumped from power. You need to get on board or get thrown overboard.
@KamalaHarris Citizens should be able to keep more of their earnings rather than have it confiscated by government.
@KamalaHarris Kamala, you wouldn’t recognize truth if you looked it in the face.
@SenGillibrand Give it up, Gilli! You are clueless.
@SenGillibrand And they deserve a legitimate education, not the indoctrination dealt by leftists
@SenGillibrand That’s what terrorism is, Gilli. My, you’ve finally said something that makes sense.  Speaking of terrorism..time to call out your dem colleagues to stop advocating for intimidation and terrorizing of Conservatives who disagree with your leftist ideology
@SenGillibrand Right,  Kirsten..so you have not touched any monies donated to you? Those who holler loudest about corruption are themselves the most corrupt
@SenGillibrand We are being invaded and you continue on your inane rants that few even care about
@SenGillibrand Gilli, tax cuts do not drive up deficit. Massive spending does. Get a clue. Americans are sick of hearing that old untrue mantra.

@SenGillibrand I think you will soon see that a pretty face is no longer an actual reason to elect and that in place of every decadent ruinous left wing dem another more reasonable person will be elected.
@SenGillibrand Okay. What Dems did to Kavanaugh, Trump, and so many others and our justice system is unjust. It is time you spoke out against injustice, Gilli. Or are yours words without meaning just like others of your ilk
@SenGillibrand Goofy Gilli. We are all made in God’s image, you represent male and female. We are Americans undivided. Stop divide and destruct mentality.
@KamalaHarris Kamala, Democrats have done nothing positive for America or Americans for decades. They have earned a notorious reputation as a party of imbeciles of no integrity who know only to lie, cheat, slander, and destroy.  Change course or your party is in the ash heap
RT @kimguilfoyle: .@realDonaldTrump is the first President is US history to be attacked for doing exactly what he said he was going to do
@SenGillibrand Oh, we will vote, Gilli. There is too much on the line. Like America’s future. A future you and Dems are rushing headlong to destroy in your lust after power.
@SenBlumenthal Oh Blumey, Take the plank out of your own eye. You are so blinded you do not recognize that the deep flaw is within you and your ilk as you purpose to distort, lie, deny justice and destroy good people.
@SenGillibrand But first, Gilli, you need to be able and willing to recognize Truth. Real Truth. Not “someone’s truth”. You are so stuck in the mire you cannot see through the swamp waters. You have no desire for Truth. You therefore demonstrate lack of character suitable for a U.S. Senator.
@SenGillibrand You are very confused Gilli.
@SenatorCollins Now, here is a woman of courage. One who is well reasoned. One who has courage to stand for truth despite threats and bullying. Not one with whom I agree on all policies, but she displays integrity and strength against those of maniacal emotions driven by lust for power.
@SenGillibrand Oh Gilli, just watch..Americans are seeing duplicitous behavior, corruption, disgusting displays of evil bullying. We do not like what we see and will demand change. Trump is evidence and only the beginning. Your behavior puts your position in jeopardy. Americans are watching.
@SenGillibrand Gilli, There have been many shams. The Dems are expert at such shenanigans. The FBI has even had sham “investigations” and the Dems have turned our judicial hearing into a sham. Can you believe we even have sham Senators who pretend to represent our best interest?
@SenGillibrand Gilli, Americans are fed up and disgusted with Dems behavior. While you destroy good people, are you not also destroying yourself? Dems no longer even pretend to be reasonable. You are on a fool’s journey and care nothing about America or Americans.
@SenGillibrand Kirsten, the behavior in the Senate..inspiring?  I was inspired to turn off the hearing in disgust. You and your ilk have polluted a sacred process. Inspiration ignites hope.  The Dems trample all that is good in their lust for power..and Americans are watching.
It would be wise to stop pretending that every woman on earth has impeccable and unimpeachable integrity.
@SenGillibrand No, Kirsten. The fundamental question is do we value rule of law, justice, and people of integrity and truthfulness. Women who seek to search and destroy people of upright character for their politics are not worthy of the name woman nor a seat in Congress.
@SenGillibrand No, Kirsten. Your behavior is shameful.
@SenGillibrand It is wise for some to be silent, rather than commit the serious offense of slander. It is wiser still to control your self before joining a conspiracy to destroy an upright person. God is watching.
@KamalaHarris You were biased from the beginning  and refuse to see you and fellow Dems are the bullies with your absurd disgusting and disgraceful behavior. Americans are seeing this. Praying you are all voted out before you further destroy our fine Republic.
@SenGillibrand Immense courage and bravery?? Christine Blasey Ford brings charges with no facts, no witnesses, and malevolent intent to destroy another. You are now a co conspirator in this evil. Persons without integrity compromise themselves into nothingness. Recalculate. Regret is painful.
@SenKamalaHarris If you really believed in blind justice, Kirsten, you would not demand Kavanaugh state how he would rule before the facts of a case is even presented.
@SenGillibrand Your “thinking” skills are lacking. Women elected Trump because real women think for themselves. They don’t parrot the poison of the media.
@senorrinhatch Dems are the party of the bullies while pretending to be outraged by bullying.
@SenGillibrand So much of what’s gone wrong in any country stems from a lack of integrity. In our country it is also due to a dearth of knowledge regarding our Constitutional Republic by those elected to represent Americans but instead serve their selfish lust for power.
@realDonaldTrump @brchute The elite need to understand that a loyal American citizen’s adoration has a limit: Disrespect for our beloved country and the values which built and blessed it, triggers a response that will always bring every arrogant goliath to their knees.
@gt5841b @SenGillibrand Lol..it is true, many senators do not have sense. Some tweets lack sense,too.
@KamalaHarris The very heart of our democratic republic is at stake if we do not secure our borders..that is what your sworn oath is about Kamala..but your only worry is partisanship.
@DLoesch Good point!
@SenBlumenthal Richard Blumenthal..you and your Dem cronies really need to be quiet and go home. Apparently none of you really care about respecting our governmental process or our fine country. No, no a Senate seat just will not do. The circus is the place for you.
@SenSchumer I would say, Chuck that you have mislead New York voters many a time. Go home. Please. We need someone of integrity.
@SenGillibrand Kirsten, do you even listen to what you say? What abortion is ever safe? Where does it say anywhere that killing a child is a right? Really, Kirsten, you have no business being a Senator until you acquire a little good sense.
@KamalaHarris Kamala, just a suggestion..how about you do the flip. Either of your attitude, or right out of the Senate. We are sick of you flipping off voters who elected This President and rejoice in The fact that we have a President who cares for America.
@KamalaHarris Remember..Trump is unindicted because for nearly two years there is found a complete lack of evidence..On the other hand, some of your Democrat cronies may well be indicted for their clear conspiratorial and criminal behavior.
@SenGillibrand Kirsten..Obama ran on change. Americans repudiated that. We love America and our Constitution and prefer to preserve this great country, not destroy it with your radical change.
@SenKamalaHarris Kamala, extreme is insisting on the absolute right to kill another human being. Insisting that every human has the absolute right to life is decency. You have it confused.
@KamalaHarris Let us vote for character and integrity, not gender.
@SenGillibrand Kirsten, Transparency that has only been talked about in Previous admin never happened. Trump has been most transparent of any President, ever. As to the flips, please backflip yourself right out of Congress. Your behavior is not worthy of such a position.
@SenGillibrand You should go home! Purposely subverting an elected President helps neither the people or the country.
@KamalaHarris It is outrageous that you disrespect the decorum of the hearing. All for a little camera time..a little show..a little shameful nonsense.
@SenGillibrand Kirsten, Do you not know that countless lives have been lost due to abortion? Tell us all again how much you care about life..it is all grandstanding. Your words are empty.
@JeffFlake I think you got that backwards, Flake. Usual play is getting old..accuse innocent of your own guilty sins.
@SenSchumer Did not seem to bother Congress when they could not read ACA.
@SenGillibrand Kirsten, please stop..you sound more ridiculous every tweet!

@KamalaHarris Kamala, this is a moment in time when so called leaders must each look in the mirror and ask, am I the one sowing division? Am I fulfilling my sworn responsibility? Start with yourself first. I challenge you. Thank you.
@KamalaHarris It is morally wrong for Congress, who has the Constitutional duty to write laws protecting our borders, to sit by and do nothing because they think they profit politically from keeping the problem alive and therefore refuse to solve it.
@KamalaHarris Kamala, The ACA was an attack on American freedom and our Republic, demonstrating unconstitutional governmental overreach.  Nonsense favoring illegals invading our border is seditious. Your foolish lust for power blinds you to America’s best interest and is self-destructive.
@SenGillibrand But again, you need to be able to discern right from wrong..it seems you lack judgment in that area.

@kingRude1408 @benshapiro @neiltyson Except I’m not a “religious” person. People practicing religion are still trying to find God. I know Him and He is able. Prayer in schools will do far more for men’s hearts than banning guns. But since the unconverted heart of man is evil, carry a gun and pray you won’t need it.
@KamalaHarris Let's be clear, they have no rights here as citizens. It is not all about the money always. Why allow lawbreakers privilege over law abiding citizens.
@benshapiro @neiltyson Actually, you may want to read the story of the bulletproof George Washington. He was quite a bit more respectful of God. And I am certain there are far more stories beyond that. But I doubt @neiltyson made an effort to look before he slandered God.

@SenBobCasey Start with yourself, Senator. Take the lead in championing the return of virtue to our culture. Decadence sends us sliding into a morass of evil that allows and encourages lawless behavior. Best Congressional action: live honorably. Heart control, not gun control is the answer.
@RepJerryNadler You are so horrified you use it for politics. There is no solution in Congress; they cannot control the human heart. Congress members could set an example and champion virtue and self control. Why not take the lead?

@SenGillibrand Kirsten, Congress cannot fix the problem of shootings. Violence grows in the human heart when virtue is dispelled from society. Our children pay the price when we break down those barriers of self control and allow decadence to rule.
@TomFitton @realDonaldTrump Crazy that judges rule that the rescinding  of an unconstitutional law is illegal. Judges of this ilk must be impeached.
@jeremycarl4 It is amazing for a judge to rule that rescinding an unconstitutional law is illegal.
@KamalaHarris Gun violence, Kamala, is a symptom of moral decadence. There was once no need for police in our schools. Respect, self control, integrity, honoring God were valued virtues. Culture war is evident in universities, schools, media, politics, churches. Our children pay the price.

@SenatorMenendez The Dems act like they do not want to fix the problem because they’ve yet to offer a fix. Trump made an offer way beyond what Americans want. Take it or stop lying and complaining. I’d be happy to send all illegals back. And happy to send you with them.

@NydiaVelazquez Stop! Any crime is disrespectful. We don’t need hate crime laws. There have been plenty of “hate” crimes btw on part of Dems trying to unseat a President since before the election of 2016. How about the Dems initiate a law regarding their own criminal behavior.
@NydiaVelazquez @realDonaldTrump Keep making ridiculous statements like that and the entire Democratic Party Will be rendered illegitimate
@NydiaVelazquez Really! You have no credibility when you make such irresponsible statements. The documentation of Dems reckless treasonous behavior is more than despicable. If you cover up you are complicit and need to go!

@Droselongrange1 @Lava20 @KamalaHarris @DeneaRandeen so how is it that you shelter in the generous USA, attend college, and want “justice” for other illegals without one thank you for the experience you enjoyed, no gratitude for the great country that is America, and no spoken desire to become American.

@gpowell1066 @RepWilson Typical lies and familiar stinking political ploys. Bet not one who diagrees with her ..
@Lava20 @Droselongrange1 @KamalaHarris Still did not hear one thank you! Only that she felt “honored” that K Harris asked her and we all know why she was asked.  Political ploys stink. I do not hear any gratefulness from her toward Americans or that she even understands Americanism.

Hence legislation to protect them. Abortion takes the life of another. You do not have to believe it but it doesn’t change the truth.
@greywitchiepoo @SpeakerRyan Yeah. That was the insidious argument PP used to snake their way into the schools. But I’ve been around long enough to see the results.
@greywitchiepoo @SpeakerRyan Oh but you can force death on a helpless being? Do see how ridiculous that sounds?
@greywitchiepoo @SpeakerRyan Really?  Have you every read documents written by our founders???Read them,  then come back and try to say that again.

@JosephW15615124 @RandPaul That people are corrupt is clear. As the line between good and evil is drawn in the heart, I am also certain it has no political boundaries. We each must come to grips with that. Thank God for a Savior.
@RandPaul The real problem is the corruption. Dishonestly using a known false report as basis for FISA request. The root of the problem is the lying heart of men for purposes of evil. Can Congress fix that?
@SenKamalaHarris Trump is President because Congress pretended to care about illegals. Your oath is to Americans; let that weight settle on your shoulders and start dealing honestly and legally. Use reason and thinking. Stop emotional manipulation.
@SenWarren @realDonaldTrump First, the “game” was not Trump’s invention. He is President primarily because of the fraud that previous admins  and Congressional members have perpetrated for their own benefit The people you have taken an oath to protect are Americans not illegals.
