@nixpix101 @srv_67 @GavinNewsom Yet, the number of fires has been steadily decreasing over the decades, even as their size and destructiveness has increased. Not absolving PG&amp;E at all (I would have voted for my friend @SenatorMoorlach's bill that Brown vetoed), but fuel load is a big issue.
@srv_67 @GavinNewsom The size of the fires on fed. land are increasing relative to the state regulated lands - largely due to the declining timber harvest starting under Clinton Admin policies in the early 90s. Trump is trying to reverse. Federal gov't makes a terrible neighbor.
@srv_67 @GavinNewsom https://t.co/6V1n9aQs8u
@srv_67 @GavinNewsom So, the longer, deeper drought 1,000 years ago in California was natural, but recent times are not? Gotcha.

@srv_67 @Hoosierchip @GavinNewsom And ask fire chiefs, they'll tell you air quality management districts and environmental lawsuits shut them down frequently. This is why Gov. Brown was compelled to sign 2 bills last year, one, increasing forest management, the other, making it easier to conduct burns.
@srv_67 @GavinNewsom Then how do you explain the even longer drought about 1,000 years ago?
@srv_67 @GavinNewsom Can you not even read a profile? I graduated from Mammoth High School in the Eastern High Sierra, lived in California for 35 years and represented almost 500,000 people in the State Assembly for 6 years.
@ST000413 @Forbes @TPPF @GovAbbott @DanPatrick @TerryWilsonTX Why, then, is there negative pricing in Texas at times? Periodic sources of energy must guarantee dispatchable power so reliable sources don't do all the work to ensure our lights stay on.
@srv_67 @GavinNewsom So, why did the harvest on federal lands begin to plunge after the listing? Further, you betray an ignorance as to how the federal Endangered Species Act works. Non-federal land practices were affected as well. https://t.co/uLfGQmldTe
@srv_67 @GavinNewsom Interesting then, that after decrying "climate change" Gov. Brown quietly signed two bills last year that partially address exactly what Pres. Trump was critical of. https://t.co/qP48OYnLl5
@srv_67 @GavinNewsom You should find out how many trees per acre there are in many parts of California and compare that to the past and to other nations with advanced forest management practices, such as Germany. Check it out and get back to me. Your profile says you're an educator.
@srv_67 @GavinNewsom Really? That's not what the officials at CalFire I spoke to said. Ever since the early 1990s with the logging restrictions due to the spotted owl, California's timber harvest dipped way below the growth rate. That fuel has to do something. It burns.

@teammoorlach With @GavinNewsom going the other way and money needed for social programs and government pensions, I doubt they'll complain much.
@LNSmithee @NRO @GavinNewsom @TPPF @CaHSRA California's lieutenant governor post isn't all that powerful.
However, in less than two years, Governor Brown will be termed out and the California High-Speed Rail project will be officially dead, killed by a new governor moored more securely to cold fiscal reality than is Brown. /End

@ShellynnB @jerseymom473 @kctheatreguy @JohnCornyn False. If the unlimited SALT deductions are restored, almost the entirety of the SALT deduction will go to the top 1% of taxpayers.
@ShellynnB @jerseymom473 @kctheatreguy @JohnCornyn Kansas is a mid-level tax state. The average state &amp; local property, income, and sales tax deduction in 2014 was $9,100. With the federal tax rate decreases &amp; the increase in the individual deduction, the vast majority of Kansans saw their federal taxes cut.
@jerseymom473 @kctheatreguy @JohnCornyn Sounds like you need to petition local government to cut taxes.
@kctheatreguy @JohnCornyn Lot of taxes you pay, you must be higher income to have SALT over $10,000.

Trump didn't kill the INF Treaty. Putin did https://t.co/MC6sLUySiV
Perhaps most importantly, continued U.S. adherence to the 32-year-old INF Treaty prevents our responding to new and dangerous challenges from China, a nation with far greater military potential than possessed by the old Soviet Union. End/
Now, with Russia's conventional military threat being far smaller than in 1987, systematic Russian cheating on the INF Treaty has different implications than it would have had before the dissolution of the Warsaw Pact. 7/
I was very familiar with the Soviet conventional and nuclear threat. It was a different world then. In many ways, more dangerous, with Europe under far greater immediate military threat then than now. 6/
At the time of the INF Treaty's signing in 1987, I was a Special Assistant for Foreign Affairs in the Pentagon - a White House appointee working for Secretary of Defense Weinberger. I was also a 2LT reserve Army intelligence officer. 5/
When President Reagan's determination to defeat the Soviet threat and denuclearize from a position of strength was shown to be firm, the Soviets, by then in serious economic difficulties, came to the table. The INF Treaty was agreed to in 1987.  4/
There were massive protests in Germany and the U.K., with some of the money and support for the protests coming from Moscow. The deployment of the Pershing missiles and GLCMs was key as the Soviet Union's ground forces in the Warsaw Pact were formidable. /3
In response, the U.S., with NATO, decided to deploy Pershing II and BGM-109G Ground Launched Cruise Missile missiles in Western Europe. The Soviet Union spared no expense with propaganda and diplomatic pressure to stop this deployment. /2
Historical context is vital when considering the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces (INF) Treaty. In the late 1970s, the former Soviet Union deployed SS-20 road mobile nuclear missiles with 3 warheads designed for use against NATO. /1

@OldstMillennial @eaglesfan3535 @TPPF Well yes, of course they were - that was before the council decided to make the shift to 100% renewable power in 2012, with 2013 being the first full year to account for the start of the policy shift. 100% wasn't achieved (on paper, not in reality) until 2016.

@charliekirk11 @KWTP This tweet is highly misleading, as the Congressional districts' boundaries extend into other counties -- Los Angeles, Riverside, &amp; San Diego. All the numbers add up. BTW, I served as a Republican Assemblyman from Orange County for 6 years.
After understanding more about his service with the SEALS in Vietnam some 15 years earlier, I grew to understand why he could be so cheerful in the early morning while training with the @theCaGuard. /6
He once told of a time in Vietnam when his SEAL team conducted a mission and was pursued for days down a river - the North Vietnamese pursuing the team on the jungle covered banks of the river while the team exfiltrated down the river. /5
Just to be more obnoxious, he'd then say, "Top of the morning to 'ya!" while lifting weights in the early morning cold when all that the rest of us could think about was getting out of our fart sacks to find a place to relieve ourselves and then find coffee. /4
He'd get up, when the rest of us were groggy and not pleased, put his feet in his slippers, and start lifting weights. /3
He had the most terrible morning wake up routine. Next to his cot (we were in a armor unit, so cots in the field), he had a welcome mat with slippers and two weights. /2
Another soldier I served with in the @theCaGuard was Major Gleason. He was a veteran of the Vietnam War where he served as a @us_navyseals. /1
I'm now 56. I think of SGT Cox, still serving in uniform as a 54-year-old combat veteran. Sergeant Cox died not long after leaving active Guard service. I honor his service. /7
And that SGT Cox had served in the 40th Infantry Division as a young soldier in the Korean War. He was about 18 in 1953. The year was 1989 and SGT Cox was around 54 years old. The colonel looked shocked and grunted under his breath as he stalked away. /6
We pointed out to the Active Duty colonel that yes, the 40th Infantry Division (@theCaGuard) had seen combat - in Korea in 1952 and 1953. /6
The colonel demanded that SGT Cox's combat patch be removed, as the 40th Infantry Division had not seen combat. /5 @40thID
I recall a time when we were training at Ft. Irwin, the National Training Center, and an Active Duty adviser, a colonel, made a comment about SGT Cox, who wore the 40th Infantry Division patch on both shoulders, meaning that he'd been in combat with the 40th. /4
The Korean War veteran I served with was SGT Cox of the 2-185 Armor Battalion out of National City, CA. /3
Because my served spanned a few eras, I served with soldiers who fought in Korea, Vietnam, the Gulf War and in Iraq and Afghanistan. /2
I enlisted in the @USArmy in 1983. I'm a lieutenant colonel in the retired reserve now, my active serve ending in 2007. The only time I carried a loaded weapon (in a non-training environment) and tear gas grenades, was during the L.A. Riots in 1992. /1

@Forrest4Trees @cd_hooks @VanceGinn @KiahCollier @TPPF Though running a global economic counterfactual history with fossil fuels from 1700 to present would be tough, no? What happens when all the whales are hunted to extinction?
@jneeley78 @VanceGinn And, here's the big issue, what is the "right" temperature for human flourishing? If the planet is, on average 1 degree warmer w/ more CO2 vs. 1 degree cooler w/ less, all things being equal, how much food can we grow and what standard of living will we enjoy? /end
@jneeley78 @VanceGinn Two things: The global system is complex - orbital mechanics, solar activity and its link to cosmic rays and their effect on cloud cover, volcanoes, ocean oscillations, and greenhouse gasses. Models tend to focus on the latter while ignoring the former. /1
Bottom line, economic growth, better technology, less poverty, rule of law - these things on a global scale are far more important to our ability to adapt to long term climate changes than is a unitary focus on CO2 in a complex climactic system. /End
Then we get to some of the practical policy issues. For instance, if we could make California just disappear, along with its 39 million people, one year's worth of China's emission increases would wipe out the CO2 reduction. /4
Many of us, including people such as Bj√∏rn Lomborg, believe that there are many issues out there that outrank CO2 insofar as human wellbeing, and that a focus on CO2 reduction will increase poverty while reducing economic growth and attendant technology advances. /3

@GarrySouth I miss you too, Garry.
@GarrySouth Check in with me when California's overdependence on its steep progressive income tax and massive unfunded government employee pension obligations hit the news again. Also, when California no longer has America's highest rate of Supplemental Poverty.
@KiahCollier @VanceGinn @TPPF It appears you haven't read my piece. For decades, California and the federal government allowed the fuel load to build up. Then, when the fires came as predicted by the forestry professionals, Gov. Brown and others blamed climate change.

@LittleDsrtFlowr So, be careful advocating against the commercial forest industry. You‚Äôll find that there is little support amongst urban voters to pay to allow you to live safely in the wildland-urban interface. /end
@LittleDsrtFlowr The for profit timber industry generates the cash used to also thin trees and clear brush. Otherwise, it‚Äôs all on the taxpayers. When that‚Äôs the case, the funds are never enough. Further, some environmentalists are advocating depopulating rural areas. /1
@LittleDsrtFlowr But private lands are subject to federal and state rules and costly timber harvest permits.
@LittleDsrtFlowr @VictorB123 These logged areas are 10-40 miles away from Paradise. Did they burn? Are they on private or federal lands?
@LittleDsrtFlowr I was referencing all forest-related employment, both private and government. 		Sorry to hear of your evacuation. Hope you have a home and neighborhood to which to return.
@LittleDsrtFlowr @VictorB123 160 years ago, that landscape would largely be grassland, punctuated by a few stands of pine as the Native population constantly burned to encourage game animals and edible plants. Forests rapidly expanded after statehood with fire suppression.
@LittleDsrtFlowr The logging occurring today is a fraction of that in the recent past. Forestry employment in California is half of what it was 20 years ago.
We eventually set Percy free in the woods. I'm guessing he never again got to play the piano for an 11-year-old. /End
I went to the piano and opened the lid on the top. Sure enough, down on the strings, was Percy Possum. He had escaped from his box in the night and climbed up into the piano, scaring the (*)*&amp;)%$ out of me. /7
Not wanting to wake my Mom and be considered crazy, I crept out of my room (the two of us lived in a 2-bedroom apartment). The piano made its gentle sound again. I saw the keys move ever so slightly -- on their own. My non-belief in ghosts was being tested. /6
Late one night I was awoken by the sound of my Mom's upright piano gently playing. It wasn't a player piano. I strained my ears. There it was again, a little louder. I suppressed a lump in my throat. /5
So I hissed and held out my finger. Percy would hold on. Eventually, Percy grew large enough to venture out in the world. I'd go riding my bike with Percy on my shoulder, his tail holding onto my neck. /4
We fed Percy bananas and Cream of Wheat, among many things. Percy grew. I read that Opossum mothers would hiss and arc their tails and their little ones would grab onto the tail with their own, to strengthen them. /3
I asked her and she agreed. We read up on what opossums eat and on any tips on raising opossum babies. Percy was small. /2

@VictorB123 @voxdotcom In Southern California, it's mainly the chaparral that's at issue. Little to no commercial value in that. It's made to burn every 12 to 25 years or so. Fire suppression combined with resistance to prescribed burns, often in steep areas, makes for a big fuel load.

@SethAMandel No, no, no. I swore I was reading your foreign policy advice daily when I was a 25-year-old foreign affairs political appointee working for Weinberger in the Pentagon in 1986 when you were 4.
Cheap timber imports as well as competition from the pine forests of the American Southeast also pressured California's forest industry. What isn't managed grows densely, and what grows densely burns hot. This is the largely untold story of California's fires.
These dense forests are more susceptible to drought, disease and fire. Timber permits became costly and environmental challenges and rules made managing the forests difficult. /5
Today, the number of people employed in the forest industry in California is half of what it was 20 years ago. The forests are getting denser. By some measures, there are 2-4 times as many trees per acre as is considered good practice. /4
A big challenge with the fires in California is the lack for forest management. For 100 years, a thriving forest products industry, in cooperation with the federal government, would thin trees and remove brush. /3
Photos taken of those same areas 100+ years later showed dense forest in California. The Native American population was no longer using fire to clear the land and California's newer residents were managing the forests, harvesting trees and suppressing fires. /2
In the mid-1800s, at the dawn of photography, photos showed an open California landscape with isolated stands of pines and oak. The Native population used fire to clear land so there would be game animals and other food. #CaliforniaFires 1/

@UNCLEjoeDaddy @PatriciaAHenso1 @Forbes @TPPF @GovAbbott Due to my high school's shop programs, as well as constant summer construction projects with my family, I paid for my college before earning a @USArmy scholarship by working as a union carpenter on industrial jobs. It would be years before I earned higher pay.
@UNCLEjoeDaddy @PatriciaAHenso1 @Forbes @TPPF @GovAbbott I don't disagree. This was a long article as it was and was focused on measures commonly used to assess educational effectiveness. Strong vocational programs likely boost HS graduation rates, though I'd need to check on the data.
@PatriciaAHenso1 @UNCLEjoeDaddy @Forbes @TPPF @GovAbbott One factor in Texas' success in education is that, for various reasons -- a strong job market, culture, faith -- the Census Bureau data shows that there is a larger than average share of 2-parent families here by race and ethnicity.

@johnddavidson The issue is that he wasn't denigrating the Cajun Navy, as suggested, rather, he made reference to some 32 people rescued by the Coast Guard in highly dangerous conditions after they were told to stay off the water. This sort of fact stays with you after a briefing.

@DunavantTj @OneVoiceforMfg @Forbes @BLS_gov @realDonaldTrump See you (me) on @FoxBusiness in a couple of days, BTW. Enjoy!
@DunavantTj @OneVoiceforMfg @Forbes @BLS_gov @realDonaldTrump You are the one conflating two different @BLS_gov series, one, for manufacturing, the other, for oil &amp; gas extraction. They measure two different things. The former bottomed out in Oct. 2016, the latter, in Dec. 2017. This undercuts the argument you made.
@DunavantTj @LubeTech @paulkrugman In the first 21 months of the Trump presidency, nonfarm employment grew by a seasonally adjusted 2.6%. In the same period, manufacturing employment grew by 3.1%, reversing the trend under Obama when overall employment grew faster than employment in the manufacturing sector. /2
@DunavantTj @LubeTech @paulkrugman From my piece: https://t.co/HuwjjVna3Q /1
@RobertDolezal Austin's been liberal for some time -- it's a government and college town. I have a pending piece that addresses this.
@DunavantTj @LubeTech Direct response to both @paulkrugman and President Obama, both of whom insisted that manufacturing jobs were not coming back in 2016. 		They did.
@DunavantTj @OneVoiceforMfg @Forbes Of course, you know that the @BLS_gov produces a separate data series for Oil and gas extraction, showing a decline in employment through the end of 2017 while manufacturing employment started up the month @realDonaldTrump was elected. Try again. https://t.co/lZErYCZCgQ

@aronro @RobertDolezal @BradMossEsq So, in any event, unless in a billet that required a clearance and it was renewed, Brennan would have lost his by January of 2019 anyway.
@aronro @RobertDolezal @BradMossEsq It appears that there is more nuance. There are 3 types of statuses for a security clearance.	Active ‚Äì Job requires security clearance.

@JohnBrennan How can freedom of speech be associated with a security clearance, given that the whole point of the latter is to keep a secret?
@KenGardner11 The answer is that Brennan's holding of a clearance is one of the things that made him a valuable media commodity. It added to his mystic and suggested that he knew secrets, perhaps even fresh secrets.
@SoquelCreek Right. And what was Brennan's billet? Who was holding the clearance for him? Somehow I doubt that it was, or we'd be hearing about it.
@KenGardner11 Right. And Brennan's billet was...?
Lastly, how can the holding of a security clearance be logically connected to the First Amendment?  Were I to reveal classified information, I would be subject to 20 years in prison or more. The whole point of classifying information is to keep it secret! /3
By comparison, I am an Army lieutenant colonel military intelligence officer. I held a top secret clearance through the Army from 1983 to 2007, until I left active reserve service and went into the retired reserve - but I am still a commissioned officer /2
The President revoked the security clearance of ex-CIA Director John Brennan today. What I don't understand is this: how can a person with no formal role in government and no private sector billet keep a clearance in the first place? /1

@RobertDolezal Of course. There is no automatic pilot. Judges run the courtroom. Bail and risk assessments support the justice system, they are not ends in and of themselves.
@RobertDolezal Lawsuits around the nation may force the abandonment of bail menus. The issue is what replaces or complements it. Risk assessments are such a tool. That said, they are not all the same.
RT @MikeBastasch: Ryan Zinke Shifts The Wildfire Debate From Global Warming To Anti-Logging ‚ÄòEnvironmental Terrorists‚Äô https://t.co/GVGWw10‚Ä¶
@RobertDolezal I doubt that approach was followed by the judge in this case.
@RobertDolezal If true, doesn't sound very conservative. That said, holding low risk people in jail before trial just because they don't have money is de facto criminalizing poverty, is unjust and is being challenged constitutionally.
@RobertDolezal Seems to me to be more the judge than the law, though I may be wrong.
@RobertDolezal Conservative bail reform uses risk assessment to determine the public safety risk. It is superior to a money bail only system in which a dangerous person with resources can get out on bond while a poor person who isn't a threat stays in jail.

@jrodz1 You‚Äôre my favorite troll. I think I‚Äôll keep you.
@ahanin Here's the @CBSNews story on my former colleague, California Democratic lawmaker Leland Yee, gun control advocate by day, gun runner by night. https://t.co/Bl90xeKV0g
@ahanin BTW, the author of the unconstitutional violent video game restriction bill was Leland Yee, a Democrat from the Bay Area. He was the California Legislature's biggest gun control advocate. He's in federal prison for, among other things, trying to run guns to ISIS.
@ahanin I have the Supreme Court and the Constitution on my side -- your feelings don't amount to much.
@ahanin Amend the Constitution if you don't like it. 3D guns are bulky and not particularly effective. If someone cannot legally own a gun, they are already violating the law when the acquire one.
@ahanin The courts have previously weighed in on a similar First Amendment question. In 2010, SCOTUS found that the 1A protects violent video games in the same way that newspapers and books are protected. When that bill came up in the CA legislature, I didn't support it.
@ahanin As for my understanding of the First Amendment, I'll stick with my own record and scholarship as a former lawmaker.
@ahanin There are already mirror sites up with copies of the plans. They are unaffected by the judge's ruling. As I said, that bell cannot be unrung.
@ahanin BTW, these detailed drawings are all over the internet - they're from the U.S. Patent Office. Do you want to outlaw them as well? https://t.co/YconGe4D2m
@ahanin What a worthless ad hominem attack. Never been paid by the NRA. I've never been a member of the NRA, though such a jab may prompt me to join. Are you familiar with the 1st Amendment? The judge's ruling will be overturned.
@ahanin The plans aren't blocked. They are out on the internet. That bell cannot be unrung. The judge is a virtue-signaling fool.
@ahanin If a person is not legally allowed to own a gun, access to 3D printer technology does not change the underlying fact that they are not allowed to possess a gun anymore than their stealing a gun changes that fact.
@ahanin I am merely pointing out the obvious: guns aren't rocket science. They are easy to make. A 3D printer can make gun components. It cannot make a whole gun. What is known cannot be made unknown by a judge's edict. That's just stupid.
A federal judge blocked the release of 3D printed gun plans on the internet. Insane. I was with Cong. Charlie Wilson in Pakistan's Tribal Areas in 1987, saw a 14-year-old kid on a lathe making an AK-47 barrel in a dusty basement lit by a single light bulb. https://t.co/69EpQo5JCq

@cpjvanveen @Alston_UNSR @uscensusbureau @UN @TPPF The challenge being manifold: the @UN report reads like a partisan, anti-U.S. screed and features attacks on @realDonaldTrump and his policies that cannot be backed by hard data and it's delivered by a former political appointee of Pres. Jimmy Carter.

I note that in your @Alston_UNSR '88 book "Making Space for New Human Rights..." you say that naming rights "elevates" them. The Soviet Union's constitution named plenty of rights: speech, press, assembly &amp; religion among them. How'd that work out? @TPPF
You @Alston_UNSR are concerned income inequality and seek ways for government to address it. I'd rather maximize opportunity and let everyone achieve to their abilities, maximizing overall prosperity. Therein is the distinction. @TPPF
#California has the highest marginal income tax rates in the nation and among the highest overall taxes and generous welfare programs, but it has the highest Supplemental poverty rate in the U.S. and higher than average income inequality. @Alston_UNSR @TPPF
Further, @Alston_UNSR you imply that the $1.5 trillion in tax cuts are bad. Why? I presume you are concerned with income inequality. But, look at #California, as an example. @TPPF
You appear to believe that government assistance is the route out of poverty, @Alston_UNSR but other data suggests that long term, inter-generational welfare dependency is toxic to stable family formation. Jobs are the best route out of poverty. @TPPF
But where are the welfare cuts of which you write? @Alston_UNSR other than a drop in use caused by greater hiring of those with limited skills entering or reentering the job market. @TPPF
You write @Alston_UNSR "...but I strongly believe, backed up by extensive evidence, that a 1.5 trillion tax cut for the rich and the hollowing out of welfare benefits, will make things worse, not great." @TPPF

What's absolutely amazing about the @UNHumanRights on poverty in the U.S. by #Australian @Alston_UNSR is that he uses anecdotal interviews and old data to come to his conclusion blasting @realDonaldTrump's policies. 1/2 @TPPF
@KenRoth He uses @uscensusbureau data from 2016 - when #Obama was president.
@Alston_UNSR You use 2016 @uscensusbureau data - gathered before @realDonaldTrump was elected. Zero credibility. But, we Americans have come to expect that from the @UN.
In addition to @Alston_UNSR's UN alleging @realDonaldTrump's policies are ‚Äúpunishing... the poor‚Äù based on data from before #Trump was elected, his @UN report ignores that data shows that a job is the best path out of poverty - lots of jobs now! @TPPF 2/2
As I suspected @Alston_UNSR's UN report that @realDonaldTrump's policies are ‚Äúpunishing and imprisoning the poor‚Äù is based on 2016 @uscensusbureau data. More of the same from what we've come to expect from the U.S.-bashing @UN. https://t.co/kZfJb6r7x2 @TPPF 1/2

So, I'm taking a vacation day from @TPPF and what do I do as a think tank numbers nerd? I pore over today's @BLS_gov employment report and tweet about it, to be followed by a conference call for @RightOnCrime. I love my job.
That said, there's a lot of noise in the seasonally-adjusted numbers. The bottom line: there's been healthy growth in African-American employment over the past year while the official unemployment rate has declined from 7.6% in May 2017 to 5.9% a year later.
Someone suggested that the black unemployment rate drop might be due to an increase in incarceration. The data shows the opposite: of the 223,000 new jobs in May, 200,000 went to African-Americans - more than 9 in 10 jobs created! https://t.co/C7seOeAv16 @TPPF
@scottlay @BLS_gov The May employment report shows African-American employment was up a remarkable 200,000 with 129,000 more black men 20 and over having jobs. So no, the data indicates that the decline in the black unemployment rate has nothing to do with an increase in incarceration.
