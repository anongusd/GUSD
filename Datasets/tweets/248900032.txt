On HBO Real Sports with Bryant Gumbel I just saw one of the greatest stories about sports, life, and marriage on ESPN NFL Insider @AdamSchefter. Adam‚Äôs love for his marriage, son, daughter, and wife, and his admiration for her husband lost on 9/11 is incredibly inspiring.
RT @NFLonCBS: Once again, LA vs. Boston takes center stage in the sports world. 	Magic Johnson introduces us to the latest chapter of the h‚Ä¶
Happy to be a part of the CBS pregame show telling a tale of 2 cities and the historic rivalries between LA and Boston.
Getting ready to watch the Rams vs Patriots in the big game. Let‚Äôs bring another championship to LA!
He changed the landscape of sports for black athletes and would have been gratified to see me as one of the Dodgers owners. I celebrate Jackie Robinson‚Äôs legacy and am so proud of his contributions to the rich history of the @Dodgers organization.
Remembering the iconic Jackie Robinson, who would have been 100 years old today. During a time when he was met with hate, his courage to walk on that field and play at the highest level is admirable.
Happy Birthday to @David_Pump and @Dana_Pump! Thanks for always helping young boys and girls with their basketball dreams and for being loyal friends to @cjbycookie and me.
You will be sincerely missed my friend.
James's music was legendary! I love his songs like "Just Once" and "Baby Come to Me" with Patti Austin.
Back in the day when I played with the showtime Lakers, I use to enjoy seeing James when my teammates and I would work out at UCLA's track and stairs.
2-time Grammy winning soul legend James Ingram passes away today. RIP my friend.
There is no room in our society for hate crimes! People have a right to be who they are and feel safe. Get well soon @JussieSmollett! Respect, love, and support from the Johnson family.

LaTanya and Sam have been a power couple for a long time. They have big hearts and give abundantly to others. Their philanthropic work does so much for education, youth, and African-American arts and culture. https://t.co/dPxqf8M0GM
LaTanya is one of the most talented actresses in film, TV, and Broadway and deserves all of the acknowledgement, respect, and love of a brilliant entertainer.
There is a beautiful article in the NY Post on my sister who I love dearly, LaTanya Richardson Jackson, wife of my best friend Sam Jackson, and star of Broadway play To Kill a Mockingbird. A must read and a must see!

Without Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., none of this would have been possible. It is on us to ensure his work is not in vain. I strive to do my part in helping the community as he believed ‚ÄúLife‚Äôs most persistent and urgent question is what are you doing for others?‚Äù
Dr. King believed ‚Äúthe function of education is to teach one to think intensively and critically‚Äù. Understanding the access education can provide, I made it a mission to help thousands of minority students go to college or return to get their HS diploma, and pursue their dreams.
I‚Äôve worked diligently to advance Dr. King‚Äôs vision using the platform that I have been blessed with, such as providing employment to over 50,000 minorities across all of my businesses.
Because of Dr. King I have been able to own my own business for over 30 years and allowed in spaces traditionally I would have been denied. I thank Dr. King for the opportunity to own sports franchises like the LA Dodgers, LA Sparks, and LAFC.
Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. was a catalyst for the black community. His dedication to obtaining equal rights for our community and sacrifice to ensure our voices were heard and doors were knocked down are the foundation for our advancement today.
Both NFC and AFC championship games went into overtime. Of all of my years watching the NFL this has to go down as the greatest NFC/AFC championship Sunday. Truly amazing!
Congratulations to my friend Patriots Owner Robert Kraft, Head Coach Bill Belichick, Tom Brady, and all of the Patriots players!
From the LA Lakers to the LA Rams Owner Stan Kroenke, EVP/COO Kevin Demoff, Head Coach Sean McVay, and players, congratulations on going to the Super Bowl!
All of LA is proud of the @RamsNFL for securing the victory over the New Orleans Saints to send them to the Super Bowl.
You are truly one of a kind. As you enter into this next decade of life, I pray that God continues to mold you into who he has created you to be and you receive all of the blessings you have sown into this world. I love you until the end of time! @cjbycookie https://t.co/CGoKP6Nnjb

Sending my prayers to the Ganakas family.

Congratulations to @heydb on receiving the Curt Gowdy Media Award! I enjoyed our time together working at ESPN. When Doris played she had a sweet jumpshot and excellent ball handling skills.
Congratulations to the entire 2018 Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame Enshrinement class including @IamTinaThompson, Charles "Lefty" Driesell, Dino Radja, Charlie Scott, Ora Mae Washington, Rod Thorn, Rick Welts, and Katie Smith! What an amazing honor.
Maurice "Mo" Cheeks was one of the best 2 way players the game has ever seen.
If it wasn't for an injury while playing in the NBA, @realgranthill33 would have gone down as one of the best all-around NBA players the game has ever seen. Before his injury, he was doing things that we've only seen from Michael, Kobe and LeBron.
.@realgranthill33 was an once in a lifetime type of player because he dominated college basketball winning back to back NCAA Championships with Duke.
Ray Allen was one of the greatest shooters the game has ever seen. Oh by the way, he's also a 2 time NBA Champion.
.@SteveNash was one of the greatest scoring and playmaking point guards to ever play the game.
.@RealJasonKidd is one of the top all-around point guards that has ever played the game.
We were blessed to witness her become a caring and brilliant young lady. Her talent was special and her potential limitless. She will be sorely missed. May she rest in peace.

Cookie and I stand in support of the victims and their families as they embark on the road to recovery; and I support the movement to hold everyone involved accountable.
If anyone was aware of the sexual assault happening to women on the MSU campus from the office of the President, Board of Trustees, athletic department, faculty &amp; campus police, and didn‚Äôt say or do anything about it, they should be fired.

Happy birthday to my amazing wife, partner, and best friend @cjbycookie. Doubt the stars that are fire, doubt the sun that does move. Doubt the truth to be a liar, but never doubt the love that¬†I have for you.
I gained an everlasting inheritance the day I met you. Proverbs 19:14 says a ‚Äòprudent (wise, sensible) wife is from the Lord.‚Äù I know that God placed favor on me by blessing me with you.
Proverbs 12:4 says that ‚Äòa wife of noble character is her husband‚Äôs crown‚Ä¶‚Äô and Proverbs 31:10 says a wife of noble character is ‚Äòworth far more than rubies.‚Äô Thank you for pushing me to be the best in all aspects of life in order to deserve you as my queen.
Genesis 2:22-24 says that a woman is made from the rib of a man. ‚ÄòThat is why a man leaves his father and mother and is united to his wife, and they become one flesh.‚Äô By Matthew 19:6, no one can separate our love that God has joined together. You are truly the best part of us.
On this day my beautiful wife and mother of my children, @cjbycookie, was born. Happy birthday my love. Thank you for your grace, patience, and kind spirit. You and your unconditional love have changed me for the better. https://t.co/T3r5NLUdLX

Coach Heathcote made me a better person, player, and champion. He turned a young kid into a man. Thank you so much for all you did for me.
As a defensive coach known for perfecting the match up zone, we were always prepared for our opponent. He made us NCAA champions in 1979!
At MSU he pushed me in the classroom &amp; coached me hard on the basketball court. I love him so much because he pushed me to be great.
My college Coach Jud Heathcote will be missed so much. He was a great man &amp; basketball coach who truly cared about me on &amp; off the court.
May God cover you and your families.
My thoughts and continuous prayers are with the residents in Houston and surrounding cities affected by Hurricane Harvey.

I love Coach Izzo and I wish I was at MSU so I could give him a big hug and a high five! @MSU_Basketball
The reason @MSU_Basketball is 12-9 overall &amp; 4-4 in the Big Ten is because of the loss of their starting center and backup center.

Watching the @Lakers game with @JeanieBuss! #Lakeshow https://t.co/4q9mBiHlcE
The LA Clippers got some more bad news today, learning PG Chris Paul will miss 6-8 weeks due to injury. Get well soon @CP3!
I really enjoy watching the Bucks' Giannis Antetokounmpo aka "The Greek Freak" and Jabari Parker. Both are All-Star caliber players!
I enjoy watching the Milwaukee Bucks. Future Hall of Famer Jason Kidd is doing a great job coaching his young Bucks team!
Even though Cleveland lost to the Warriors, I enjoyed watching LeBron James play Point Guard!
Kyle Korver hitting three 3's and scoring 11pts proved he will help Cleveland especially when JR Smith gets back.
Kevin Durant has made the game so much easier for Steph, Klay &amp; Draymond and vice versa.
The thing that impressed me the most was the Warriors outstanding defense, which led to a lot of fast break points.
Golden State's Big 4, Durant, Curry, Thompson &amp; Green all played great last night on offense and defense in the Warriors win over the Cavs.

It's up to all of us to continue Dr. King's fight for the equal rights of all people regardless of their race, sex, econ status or religion.
Happy #MLKDay! Today is a celebration of the life and legacy of an American hero!
Looking fwd to next week's matchups! The 2 high power offenses, Packers vs Falcons &amp; 2 of the most storied franchises, Patriots vs Steelers!
To Pittsburgh's James Harrison, all I can say is "You're a baaad man"! Lol
Three of my most favorite players to watch in the NFL are the Steelers' Ben Roethlisberger, Le'Veon Bell, and Antonio Brown.
Steelers RB and former MSU Spartan Le'Veon Bell was outstanding with 170yds to lead his team in the 18-16 win over the Chiefs!
Congratulations to a winner and one of the best coaches in the NFL, Steelers' Coach Mike Tomlin!
I hope this Pittsburgh vs. Kansas City game is just as exciting as the Packers vs. Cowboys game.
Aaron Rodgers, who I call the Larry Bird of the NFL, did it again w/ a tremendous drive w/ under a min left to set up the winning FG.
Green Bay's last second win over Dallas was an amazing game played by 2 outstanding teams.

My Lakers beat the Pistons in '88 and they beat us in '89. More recently the Warriors beat the Cavs in '15 &amp; the Cavs beat them in '16.
My "Showtime" Lakers beat the 76ers in '82 and they beat us in '83. The Celtics beat my Lakers in '84 and we came back to beat them in '85.
I thought Clemson would beat Alabama because it's very hard to beat the same team 2 times in a row for a championship.
In my opinion that was the best CFB National Championship game ever!
I was at the Texas vs. USC nat'l title game in Pasadena, when Vince Young's late drive sealed the championship for Texas!
Last night's game w/ Clemson's TD in the final seconds to beat Alabama, in my opinion, is the 2nd greatest CFB national title game ever.

A special shoutout to David Robinson who is also a great businessman and investor.
A special shoutout to Grant Hill, who is a great businessmen and incredible owner of the ATL Hawks!
I know Phil Jackson, he's a good man. I don't think he¬†meant to disrespect LeBron James and his team.
Phil Jackson made one small mistake by using the word posse.
Steph Curry, Kevin Durant, Carmelo Anthony, Derek Jeter, Tom Brady, Peyton Manning, Joe Montana, Ronnie Lott, Shaq O'Neal &amp; Charles Barkley.
Other athletes who have business teams I respect incl:Floyd Mayweather, Kobe Bryant, Emmitt Smith, Jr. Bridgeman, Dwayne Wade, Chris Paul...
Team LeBron ranks up there with Michael Jordan's team and my team in developing and creating business opportunities!
Maverick Carter and Rich Paul have overdelivered not only to LeBron James but also to corporate america and the fans.
LeBron James' team of Maverick Carter, Rich Paul and others have achieved nothing less than greatness!
Fmr athletes who paved the way and showed me I could be a businessman are Roger Staubach, John Elway, Dave Bing, Oscar Robertson &amp; Mel Farr!
James Harden and DeMar DeRozan are definitely early MVP candidates!
Two guys that are balling out of control right now in the NBA are James Harden avg. 30p 8r &amp; 12a and DeMar DeRozan avg. 34p, 5r &amp; 3a.

Mayweather is too fast, too smart and his will to win is greater than Pacquiao's.
The Boxing world is talking about a possible Mayweather/Pacquiao rematch. It would be the same results as the first fight.
I can't wait to see my Raiders back playing in primetime on NBC, tonight against the Broncos!
I'm in my Man Cave watching the Giants beat the Eagles 14-3.
Hats off to Clippers' Coach Doc Rivers, he did a masterful job of improving the Clippers one weakness and that was their bench.
The Clippers are so strong because they have the best bench in the West, adding Speights &amp; Felton to go along w/ Crawford, Rivers &amp; Johnson.
The Clippers blew out the Spurs in S.A. last night 116-92. I'm picking the Clippers to play the Warriors in the Western Conference Finals.
LeBron James has led his Cavs to a 6-0 start if they finish the season with the best record in the league, he should be the NBA MVP.
I'll be hanging out in my Man Cave tonight watching two great games, Alabama vs. LSU and Clippers vs. Spurs!
I see why the Lakers are playing so good, they're wearing the uniforms we used to wear with the "Showtime" Lakers! LOL

Tonight, Golden State is playing like the super team we all thought they could be.
Kevin Durant gave a dominant performance in the first half with 29pts. As a scorer, there is nobody in the NBA that can compare to KD.
Golden State played their best half of the season on offense and defense and are leading OKC at 63-48 at halftime!

Laker Nation: Tough stretch for the Lakers after the loss to OKC last night,w/ games vs. the Pacers, Hawks and then the Warriors on Friday.
...behind LeBron's group in Cleveland and Steph Curry's group at Golden State.
I'm impressed w/ the Chicago Bulls starting Rondo, Butler, Wade &amp; MCW off the bench they have the 3rd best group of guards in the league...
...Carmelo Anthony, Paul George, Hassan Whiteside, Jimmy Butler and Andre Drummond.
Also probably in the early MVP conversation is James Harden, Chris Paul, Blake Griffin, Damian Lillard, DeMarcus Cousins, Anthony Davis...
Kevin Durant is playing great for the Warriors and should be in the MVP conversation averaging 31pts, 10reb and 4ast.

The Eastern Conference is a lot better this year with improvements from teams like the Indiana Pacers, Chicago Bulls &amp; New York Knicks!
The Cleveland Cavaliers will have to go through the Boston Celtics and Toronto Raptors to get to the NBA Finals.
Two teams that the Golden State Warriors will have to go through are the San Antonio Spurs and the Los Angeles Clippers.
I know the Golden State Warriors are too good of a team not to improve on defense this season on their way to the NBA Finals.
Thank you to the Honda Executive Team for allowing me to speak to their car dealers in Atlanta‚Ä¶ https://t.co/qGar1UnJ4o
Last night the Spurs ran their offense through the front line of Leonard, Aldridge and Gasol and they dominated the smaller Warriors team.
One of the best signings in Free Agency that went under the radar this summer was Pau Gasol signing with the San Antonio Spurs.
The Golden State bench, to me, is not as good as last year due to Barbosa and Speights leaving.
Watching the game against the Spurs the Warriors missed the presence of Bogut in the middle &amp; Barnes defending the other team's best scorer.
News Flash: The Golden State Warriors, to me, are not as good as last year's team because of their defense and their bench.

...Eric Garner, Philando Castile, Trayvon Martin, Alton Sterling, Keith Lamont Scott, Terence Crutcher and so many more the societal norm.
Our police system must work for and protect African Americans in a way that does not make the deaths of Mike Brown, Sandra Bland...
As Black leaders, businessman, clergy, athletes and entertainers we must use our platform to speak out on inequality &amp; injustice in America.
America must unify and make black lives a priority to start solving the issues of inequitable treatment of African Americans in this country
As Americans we have to work together to fix what is going on in OUR country. Americans cannot remain silent.
These issues are not just black problems or white problems, they are American problems.
When the police and community work together to develop strong relationships, it creates positive and safe environments for our families.
We need to look at the officers‚Äô records, backgrounds and begin to discipline, fire and arrest. #Accountability
We cannot ignore the inconsistent policing in this nation.
We must remain peaceful and nonviolent.
For those protesting in Charlotte, who are upset and frustrated over the death of Keith Scott, destruction and violence is not the answer.
This is happening too often, the senseless shootings in Tulsa &amp; Charlotte are powerful reminders of how much work has to be done in America.
My prayers go out to the families of Keith Lamont Scott and Terence Crutcher. May God give you comfort &amp; peace during this difficult time.

I definitely want to be a part of that discussion and help bring about those changes.
...to start solving the issues with treatment of African-Americans in this country.
It's time for us to form a coalition of African-American community leaders and influencers with law enforcement and politicians...
It's time that we use our platform and our influence to affect change.
All politicians, community organizers, clergy, athletes and entertainers must join together to help fix the broken system in our country.
...and should be afforded the full protection under it's mandate.
African-Americans are guaranteed the same rights and privileges by the U. S. Constitution as are all Americans...
...of our differences in race, background or religion. We are all one community.
To respond to injustice with violence is not the answer. We must unite and show the world that we are not divided regardless...
... May God give you comfort and peace during this difficult time.
My thoughts and prayers are with the families of the 5 fallen officers and 7 injured officers following the peaceful protest in Dallas...
Af-Am and all people shouldn't have to worry if their spouses, kids, family members, loved ones or themselves will return home safely.
My heartfelt condolences to the family, children and friends of Alton Sterling &amp; Philando Castile. May God wrap his loving arms around you.

The way Jeff Van Gundy &amp; Mark Jackson analyzed the games &amp; broke down the strategies, I don't understand why they aren't coaching in the NBA
Big thank you to Mike Breen, Jeff Van Gundy and Mark Jackson for doing an outstanding job calling this NBA Finals series!
Now we all have to wonder what happens with the Golden State Warriors. They have to get better, if they want to get back to the NBA Finals.
Bad shot selection, especially from the 3pt line cost the Golden State Warriors a championship.
Congrats to rookie head coach and my friend Tyronn Lue! Coach Lue made some great in-game adjustments to put the Cavs in position to win!
There can't be anymore LeBron James haters. He's proved that he is still the best player in the world with this championship!
LeBron James delivered on his promise to bring a championship to Cleveland, now if he decides to leave nobody can be mad at him.
LeBron James with this championship sealed his legacy as one of the five greatest players to ever play this game!
Coach Lue deserves a lot of credit, he drew up an excellent play to get Kyrie Irving the ball and he delivered with the game winning shot!
LeBron James took this series over in the last 3 games, like the great ones do and brought the championship home to Ohio!
Congratulations to LeBron James and the Cleveland Cavaliers on winning the NBA Championship!

If Cleveland is going to win Game 7, LeBron and Kyrie have to be special like they were in Game 5.
If Golden State is going to win Game 7 they have to play much better on the defensive end than they did in the last 2 games.
Golden State should feel good going into Game 7. Steph Curry found his game and Klay Thompson woke up in the 2nd half tonight.
There are some good things the Warriors can take away from this game, especially the way they played in the 2nd half.
I can't deny LeBron James, he's definitely on my Mt. Rushmore. He's a winner and we've never seen anybody with his all around skill set.
I've been really impressed with Coach Lue's  decision making.
Coach Tyronn Lue has stepped his game up, putting Kyrie &amp; LeBron in the Pick &amp; Roll, forcing the Warriors to make mistakes on defense.
The Cavs beat the Warriors at their own game...making shots from the 3pt line and scoring fast break points.
The Cavs had a tremendous will to win tonight. They were more physical than the Warriors and played great defense.
We all should be thankful that we have a player like LeBron James in the NBA! Just another stellar performance!
I love watching greatness.
LeBron James was fantastic, marvelous, sensational, incredible...What else can I say?! He scored 41pts, 8reb, 11ast.
It's very important that you have the right people on your team.	https://t.co/oYvxJWcSjj

After the Cavs win in Golden State tonight, I really feel that there will be a Game 7.
The Warriors didn't play a smooth game  on offense or defense because of the absence of Draymond Green.
The Cavs win over the Warriors tonight just shows you how much Draymond Green means to the Warriors team.
LeBron James and Kyrie Irving become the first teammates to score over 40pts in a finals game.
When you have a big game on the road your superstars have to dominate and that's exactly what LeBron and Kyrie did.
Kyrie &amp; LeBron were special tonight both scoring 41pts to lead the Cavs in the Game 5 win.
Ron Mason was a big part of the Green &amp; White family and he will be sorely missed.
Cookie and I send our prayers to Ron Mason's family and friends.
Rest in Peace to my friend, former MSU AD and hockey coach Ron Mason.
If Cleveland wins tonight, I think it will be a 7 game series.
...Jim Chones grabbed 10rebs, Michael Cooper and Norm Nixon played great defense and Brad Holland scored 8pts off the bench.
I remember in the 1980 NBA Finals when league MVP Kareem Abdul-Jabbar got hurt in Game 5 and in Game 6 Jamaal Wilkes scored 37pts...
I'm really intrigued to see how Golden State will play in Game 5 without Draymond Green.

Really good win for the @Dodgers tonight against our archrival Giants 3-2!
The crazy thing about the Golden State Warriors is that they are a young team that could win 3 or 4 championships in a row.
The Cavs are going to have to make some major moves this off-season if they're going to bring a championship to Cleveland.
The Cavs problem is that they have too many players that play offense and very few that play defense.
Golden State returned the favor to Cleveland by playing more physical than the Cavs tonight.
When Steph &amp; Klay are playing great together the Warriors are a hard team to beat.
I said Steph &amp; Klay had to have big games and they did scoring 38pts &amp; 25pts respectively to lead the Warriors in the 108-97 Game 4 win.
I can't wait to see what happens in the all-important Game 4! #NBAFinals

No other former athlete has received words of admiration and respect from two different Presidents.
Every speaker at Muhammad Ali's memorial service spoke great words about him, shared funny stories and talked about how humble he was.
Lonnie Ali's words about her husband let us in on how he felt about the poor, disenfranchised and those who have been left behind.
Seeing all of the people celebrate Ali's life as the funeral procession passed through the streets of Louisville brought tears to my eyes.
A big heartfelt Thank You to ESPN for broadcasting Muhammad Ali's memorial service.
https://t.co/RTfpDy4aKl
Coach Steve Kerr has to find a way to get Klay Thompson &amp; Steph Curry going if the Warriors are going to win Game 4.
Coach Lue made all the right adjustments in Game 3 and I look forward to seeing what he has in store for Game 4.
On defense, Coach Lue had his players aggressively double-team any Pick &amp; Roll and their rotations to the ball were simply outstanding!
Cavs Coach Tyronn Lue had his players fired up and developed an excellent game plan against the Warriors in Game 3.
If Steph &amp; Klay don't have big games in Game 4, there's no way they can win in Cleveland &amp; the series will go back to Golden State tied 2-2.
Cleveland has kept Steph Curry out of rhythm for 3 straight games.
With Cleveland's blowout win tonight, the momentum has swung over to the Cavs.
The reason the Cavs blew the Warriors out was because of their defense and physicality.
LeBron James finally got some help from Kyrie Irving who scored 30pts and 8 ast including 16pts in the 1st qtr.
LeBron set the tone for his Cavs teammates tonight with his smart, physical play.
LeBron James showed us why he's been the best all around player &amp; one of the best players to ever play the game scoring 32pts 11rebs &amp; 6ast.
The Cavs needed a special performance from LeBron James tonight and he delivered.
How you deal with rejection can make a world of difference in your life. https://t.co/p75XkTY9u4

The Warriors are a bad match-up for the Cavs because they have 5 playmakers and ball handlers on the floor at all times.
For the first two games, Draymond Green has been the MVP of the NBA Finals!
Coach Steve Kerr has his Warriors playing at the top of their game, especially on the defensive end, which fuels their offense.
The Cavs problem is that they aren't versatile enough or deep enough.
There comes a point in the NBA Finals when one team knows that the other team is better than they are, the Cavs now know.
Just another dominant team win by the Warriors. Green 28pts, Curry 18pts, Thompson 17pts and another excellent game from their role players.
The Cavs dared Draymond Green to beat them from the 3pt line and that's what he did shooting 5-8 from behind the line and scoring 28pts.
The Golden State Warriors put on another dominant performance on the defensive end blowing out the Cavs 110-77 in Game 2 of the NBA Finals!
Seager hit 2 HRs and Grandal &amp; Hernandez both hit one HR to lead the @Dodgers in today's 12-6 win over the Braves!

This is when I received the Muhammad Ali  award from the G.O.A.T himself at a black tie event in Phoenix! https://t.co/wurAdGakFx
I will miss my friend, my hero and one of the greatest activists America has ever seen. That is why Muhammad Ali will always be the G.O.A.T.
The other 2 boxers that are my favorites are Sugar Ray Leonard and Mike Tyson.
..and he would tell you what he was going to do and then back it up in the ring. He fought the best of the best in the Heavyweight division.
Muhammad Ali was the reason I fell in love with boxing. He was a champion, a showman, he was charismatic...
Special thank you to Howard Bingham for making sure I always got a chance to talk to Muhammad and for all of the great photos he took of us.
When I heard the news, the first thing that came to my mind was one of Muhammad Ali's best friends, Howard Bingham.
To Muhammad Ali's wife Lonny, his children, grandchildren and family, Cookie and I send you our prayers and condolences.
He would always say he was the real "Magic Man" because I didn't know how to do any tricks!
What I use to love about seeing Muhammad Ali was that he always had a new magic trick to show me.
I will always be indebted to my friend Muhammad Ali!
...because of the color of their skin.
...to put people to work, send kids to college, address social injustice and fight for those who were being discriminated against...
He wanted me to use my platform affect change in the inner cities of America and that's when I built my company and foundation...
I remember Muhammad Ali calling me and telling me to meet him in Chicago. He told me that he wanted me to be more than a basketball player.
...Most of us in attendance cried because we knew it was the end of our hero's illustrious boxing career.
I saw Muhammad Ali fight live 5 times, but the last fight against Larry Holmes was very emotional for me and everyone in attendance...
...As you might expect, I was starstruck to finally meet my hero and a man who was larger than life!
As a rookie, during my first week in Los Angeles, Dr. Buss introduced me to Muhammad Ali at a party thrown in Muhammad's honor...
A big Thank You to ABC's Wide World of Sports and especially Howard Cosell because that's how America fell in love with Muhammad Ali!
When I became a teenager I would go to the local theater to watch Muhammad Ali's fights on Closed Circuit TV. Lol  Who remembers that?
My father &amp; I would listen to all of Muhammad Ali's fights on the radio when I was a kid. That's when he became my favorite boxer &amp; athlete.
Muhammad Ali was the G.O.A.T. not just because of boxing but for his willingness to give up fame and fortune for the good of mankind.

I love that moment when Coach Kerr broke the clipboard. It brought the focus back to his Warriors team.
Outstanding coaching job by Warriors Coach Steve Kerr preparing his team to shutdown the Cavs 3pt shooters and they did.
Cleveland's easy series against Detroit Atlanta and the series against Toronto did not prepare them to play Golden State.
The Warriors' hard fought, tough series against OKC prepared them for Cleveland.
LeBron had a great game but his teammates, when they aren't scoring don't have other ways to effect the game and that's a major problem.
People forget that Shaun Livingston, before his injury was going to be the next Penny Hardaway, that's how good he was.
The NBA MVP Steph Curry scored 11pts and Klay Thompson only scored 9pts and the Warriors still won.
Livingston 20pts, Green 16pts, Barnes 13pts, Iguodala 12pts led the group of 7 Warriors who scored in double figures!
The Golden State Warriors' role players led them to the 104-89 victory in Game 1 of the NBA Finals!
Getting ready for Cavaliers vs. Warriors in Game 1 of the NBA Finals! I'm looking forward to a great series!

World get ready for LeBron James vs. Steph Curry in the NBA Finals!
This is what I wanted, a rematch of last year's NBA Finals, Cleveland vs. Golden State with both teams healthy!
Congrats to the Golden State Warriors, led by Steph Curry's 36pts tonight to their 2nd straight NBA Finals!
With tonight's victory, the Dodgers win 2 out of 3 over the Mets. #Dodgers
After Utley's 2HRs led us to victory yesterday, Gonzalez hits a 2 run single in the 9th to lead us in the win over the Mets tonight.
Thunder coach Billy Donovan has to make in-game adjustments in Game 7.
The Warriors' pace and depth wore the Thunder down in Game 6.
Coach Kerr in the 4th qtr on defense made  a subtle adjustment for his team to build a wall to keep Westbrook &amp; Durant out of the lane.
One of the adjustments Coach Kerr made in the 4th qtr on offense, was to run the pick &amp; roll which created open shots for Klay and Steph.
Coach Kerr's adjustment to play small ball in the 4th qtr helped seal the win for the Warriors.
Warriors coach Steve Kerr deserves a lot of credit, he made outstanding in-game adjustments to lead his team to victory over OKC in Game 6.
Congrats to Klay Thompson on making a NBA playoff record 11 3-pointers!
I can't wait to watch Game 7!
In a win or go home game your superstars have to play like superstars.
Steph Curry (31pts) &amp; Klay Thompson (41pts) played like superstars tonight in the win against OKC.
I think the world will be tuning in to watch the Warriors vs. Thunder tonight!
Cleveland took care of their business last night, today is OKC's turn.
If I was starting a team today, my first pick would be LeBron James and it would be an easy choice.
LeBron James showed us again last night why he's the best all around player in the game, scoring 33pts, 11rebs and 6ast.
Congratulations to LeBron James on going to his 6th straight NBA Finals!
Good Luck to @Dodgers 19-year-old phenom, Julio Urias, in his Major League Baseball debut against the Mets! #Dodgers

Coach Steve Kerr giving Bogut &amp; Speights more minutes proved to be a good decision.
The Warriors finally played their game of "Pace &amp; Space" and that's why they ended up winning the game.
I thought the Warriors role players won the game for them. Speights, Bogut, Iguodala and Livingston all played well.
Draymond Green played his best game of the series!

.@Dodgers fans we lost another close one last night. Hopefully we will get back on the winning track today w/ Maeda on the mound! #Dodgers
I still feel the Cavs will win the series because LeBron is playing some of his best basketball &amp; the Cavs are the best team in the East.
It was good to see Lowry &amp; DeRozan have great games but Biyombo dominated with 26rebs  and great defense in the Raptors win over the Cavs!

You can tell the OKC Thunder have matured by the way they didn't celebrate after the win.
Remember in February on ESPN's Mike &amp; Mike and First Take I said that the one team that could possibly beat the Warriors was OKC.
Russell Westbrook set the tone for OKC in the 2nd half scoring 19pts in the 3rd qtr. His composure may lead them to the championship.
Russell Westbrook, Kevin Durant and the Thunder role players played a fantastic game.
OKC's win over the Warriors didn't surprise me because they carried over their great play from the Spurs series.

Thunder vs. Warriors in the Western Conference Finals will be 7 thrilling and exciting games and I'm picking the Warriors to win!
If the Golden State Warriors don't play better than they did against the Blazers, they will not beat the OKC Thunder.
NBA fans, I told you the one team in the West that could possibly beat the Warriors is OKC because of Durrant and Westbrook.
OKC vs. Golden State series will have it all...especially star power w/ Warriors' Curry, Green &amp; Thompson &amp; OKC's Durant, Westbrook &amp; Ibaka!
NBA Fans we are in for a treat! We will see the Oklahoma City Thunder versus the Golden State Warriors in the Western Conference Finals!
The Oklahoma City Thunder's victory tonight was total team domination. It was the best I've seen them play in this series.
I'll be watching the Spurs vs. Thunder on the plane flying back to LA from Colorado Springs! I can't wait!

As the biggest NBA fan I'm excited to watch the Blazers backcourt of Damian Lillard and CJ McCollum for years to come!
The Warriors should thank the Blazers because they prepared them for the next round with a hard fought series.
Congrats to the Golden State Warriors as they beat the Blazers in a thrilling Game 5, 125-121 to advance to the Western Conference Finals!

Mychal Thompson, father of Klay &amp; Trayce, was a better athlete! Lol
After watching Trayce &amp; Klay Thompson grow up, it's amazing watching them now as professional athletes in the MLB and NBA!
Great 3-2 win for our @Dodgers over the Mets last night, thanks to Trayce Thompson's first career walk-off home run!
Biggups to my boy @DwyaneWade for passing me on the NBA's All-Time Playoff Scoring list!
If Westbrook can continue to stay in attack mode and keep the speed of the game up, it's going to be hard for the Spurs to win on the road.
Russell Westbrook stayed in attack mode all night long, whether he was making a play for himself or his teammates.
Russell Westbrook played a spectacular game scoring 35pts 11rebs and 9asts!
Thank you to @Allstate CEO, Tom Wilson, for bringing me in to speak at Allstate's sales conference in Las Vegas! https://t.co/awve5FA0DS
What a year for @StephenCurry30, first the Warriors win 73 games, which no team has ever done and now he's the first ever unanimous MVP!
The Babyface Assassin, @StephenCurry30 has done it again, being voted as the NBA's first unanimous Most Valuable Player!
Our Dodgers came up short in the 4-2 loss to the Mets last night. We look to bounce back tonight with Alex Wood on the mound! #Dodgers
The NBA Playoffs have been FANTASTIC!
I can't wait to see who's going to take a 3-2 series lead in the Thunder/Spurs series tonight!
Future Hall of Famer Dwyane Wade has taken his game to another level with his leadership and late game heroics!
Dwyane Wade continues to turn back the clock and he did it again last night with 30pts to lead the Heat in the OT win against the Raptors.
These NBA Playoffs have featured some great basketball! It cont'd with Miami's OT win over Toronto &amp; Golden State's OT win over Portland!
Back to Back MVP @StephenCurry30 is the most exciting player in the NBA today and he played like it last night!
The MVP Steph Curry came back from injury w/ a 40pt performance and 17pts in OT to lead the Warriors in the victory over Portland in Game 4.
Pat Riley, R.C. Buford and Jerry West are the best executives in the NBA right now.
To a guy I have much respect for Spurs GM R.C. Buford, congratulations on being named the NBA Executive of the Year!
Good back to back wins for the Dodgers over the Blue Jays with great pitching from Kershaw yesterday and Stripling today! #Dodgers
With his 40pt performance, Damian Lillard showed the world why he should've been an NBA All-Star!
Damian Lillard put on a one man show last night scoring 40pts to lead the Blazers over the Warriors in Game 3!
Canelo vs. GGG will be a fight you can not miss! It will be full of action!
What an overhand right from Canelo Alvarez to knockout Amir Kahn in the 6th Round last night!

Waiting to see what the Golden State Warriors do against the Portland Trailblazers. It should be a good game.
Kyle Lowry had a bounce back game, scoring 33pts to lead the Raptors past the Heat.
The Cleveland Cavaliers are doing everything; shooting well, playing great defense and their "Big 3" have been fantastic.
The Cavs have a 3-0 series lead over the Hawks. They are playing their best basketball of the season right now.

Cleveland's "Big 3", Kevin Love, Kyrie Irving and LeBron James all played great in Game 1 led by LeBron's 25pts.
The OKC role players outplayed the Spurs role players in the game 2 win.
Kevin Durant played like the superstar that he is tonight, scoring 28pts to help lead OKC in the game 2 win.
OKC won because of the aggressive play and penetration from Russell Westbrook, who led his team in the win over the Spurs with 29 points.
Waiters foul on Ginobili was the worst missed call in playoff history.
Laker Nation: The Lakers should call LeBron James agent. We know he's going stay in CLE but they should go after him just in case he leaves.
Laker Nation: I would love to see Kevin Durant in the Purple &amp; Gold!
Laker Nation: The first free agent the Lakers should go after is Kevin Durant.
It's crazy that Klay Thompson can score 37pts and its considered quiet!
Golden State Warriors superstar Klay Thompson scored a quiet 37pts in the win over the Blazers!
Laker Nation: DeMar DeRozan should be one of the free agents we go after this summer.
Congratulations to coach Dwane Casey and the Toronto Raptors on advancing to the 2nd rd led by DeMar DeRozan's 30pts!

Laker Nation, I'm excited that Luke Walton is the new coach!
My @Dodgers finally broke our losing streak, beating the Padres 1-0, with a dominant performance from the mound by Clayton Kershaw! #Dodgers
I'm looking forward to Game 7 between the Pacers and Raptors!
What makes the Spurs a championship caliber team is that the "Big 3" can take a backseat to the new "Big 2" in Aldridge and Leonard!
San Antonio's 2 new superstars LaMarcus Aldridge 38pts &amp; Kawhi Leonard 25pts led them in the Game 1 win over the Thunder.
San Antonio's Kawhi Leonard and his Spurs teammates did a great job of keeping Westbrook out of the lane in Game 1.
Spurs Coach Gregg Popovich in Game 1 came up with a great game plan against Russell Westbrook.
Warriors Coach Steve Kerr showed us why he won the Coach of the Year award, with his excellent game plan against the Blazers in Game 1.
The Warriors are so good because they play well together, they make the extra pass &amp; they're one of the best defensive teams in basketball!
.@Money23Green posted another triple double with 23pts, 13reb and 11ast to lead the Warriors over the Blazers 118-106 in Game 1!
With Steph Curry on the floor the Golden State Warriors are a championship team! Without him they are still a very good team!
Trust me everybody, next year Kemba Walker will be an NBA All-Star, which for now will be played in Charlotte!
Congrats to Michael Jordan's well coached Charlotte Hornets team on a good season! They have a rising star in Kemba Walker!
The Heat also have really good role players in Deng, Dragic, Johnson and Whiteside, to give the Cavs all they want in a 7 game series!
Miami has Coach Erik Spoelstra, one of the best coaches in the NBA and a superstar &amp; future Hall of Famer in Dwyane Wade.
If the Heat meet the Cavs in the playoffs, they have everything they need to compete against them!
If the Heat play to their full potential they're the only team that could have a chance to beat the Cavs, who are favorites to win the East!
Congrats to the Miami Heat on advancing to the 2nd Round! @DwyaneWade in game 6 &amp; 7 led his team to with his spectacular play!
I'm celebrating a new generation of playmakers! 	https://t.co/7f3murEdXC

The series I'm really looking forward to is the Oklahoma City Thunder vs. the San Antonio Spurs in the 2nd Round!
I feel Golden State could beat Portland or the Clippers in the 2nd Round without Steph Curry and advance to the Western Conference Finals!
Golden State should close out the series tonight against the Rockets despite Steph Curry being out of the lineup!
It will be interesting to see how the Clippers respond tonight in game 5 vs. Portland after losing Chris Paul &amp; Blake Griffin to injuries.
I'm looking forward to the Heat vs. Hornets game 5 tonight, to see who's going to take the 3-2 series lead!
I hope my boys in blue, the @Dodgers, can get back to our winning ways tonight after losing two straight against the Marlins! #Dodgers

Congrats to Warriors Coach Steve Kerr, who definitely deserves the Coach of The Year award with his team winning a record setting 73 games!
The Clippers losing 2 starters in the playoffs reminds me of when Byron Scott and I both pulled our hamstrings in the 1989 Finals!
It seems like when it rains it pours for the Clippers w/ Griffin out for the rest of the playoffs. I feel bad for him and Coach Doc Rivers.
I don't know if everyone knows how much I was looking forward to seeing the Warriors/Clippers in the 2nd Rd w/ both teams at full strength!
First @StephenCurry30 gets injured and now @CP3. I'm devastated because I enjoy watching both of them perform in the playoffs.
.@CP3 is the leader and backbone of the Clippers team and it will be hard for them to replace him.
I'm one of the biggest @CP3 fans in the world and I'm so disappointed for Chris that he got injured last night.

Sitting at home watching the Hornets vs. Heat game I didn't know who to cheer for, MJ and the Hornets or Pat Riley and the Heat!
If you missed the Hornets/Heat game, you missed an exciting game with the Hornets winning to tie the series at 2-2!
I feel @Candace_Parker is the best all around women's basketball player in the world!
I'm very disappointed @Candace_Parker wasn't selected to the USA Basketball Women's Olympic Team.
Good Luck to the Lakers organization on finding their next head coach!
I know in my heart that Byron Scott will be back coaching in the NBA soon because he's a great coach!
I feel bad for my friend &amp; former teammate Byron Scott, after the Lakers decided not to retain his services.
I love the NBA Playoffs!
I'm excited to see who wins the PG battle between Lillard &amp; Paul tomorrow in the Clippers/Blazers game 4! So far Paul has outplayed Lillard.
In the Cavs sweep of the Pistons, Cleveland's "Big 3" LeBron, Kevin and Kyrie dominated the series!
We have 2 really good series in the Eastern Conference. Raptors/Pacers and the Hawks/Celtics with both series tied at 2-2!
When Curry went down, Thompson, Green, Iguodala &amp; Livingston all took their games to another level to lead the Warriors to victory!
We all know Westbrook is athletic and a great scorer, now he's turned in to a great floor leader!
Congrats to my boy Russell Westbrook on tying my regular season recorded with 18 triple doubles and taking his game to a whole new level!
The San Antonio Spurs took care of business today, completing the sweep against the Memphis Grizzlies!
Congrats to CJ McCollum on being named the NBA's Most Improved Player!
Great comeback win for the @Dodgers scoring 5 runs in the 9th to beat the Rockies 12-10 and taking 2-3 in the series!

The only good thing about this Lakers season is that we get a chance to say goodbye to Laker Great and Future Hall of Famer, Kobe Bryant!
I thought last season was bad because it was the worst in Lakers history. It looks like this season will be the worst in Lakers history.
The loss to Utah was bad because the Lakers didn't put up a fight, hustle and it looked like they were out there going through the motions.
This Lakers season is getting worse with the 48pt loss to Utah 123-75, which ties the worst loss in franchise history.
Here's what I learned about success from the most celebrated ballerina of our generation, @mistyonpointe! https://t.co/BJfCyAQ5do

Spartan Nation: I'm still in mourning so I can't comment on the loss to MTSU.
In the Spurs victory it wasn't the "Big 3" but too much LaMarcus Aldridge and Kawhi Leonard leading the Spurs in the win.
The Spurs won because they ran the Warriors off of the 3pt line. I haven't seen another team in the NBA do that.
The San Antonio Spurs proved to the NBA and themselves that they can beat the Golden State Warriors with their 87-79 win last night.

Laker Nation: The victory over the Warriors today will give the young Lakers players a lot of confidence for the rest of the season!
Laker Nation: Standing ovation for the Lakers fans! They were outstanding and helped will the Lakers to the victory over the Warriors!
The key to the Lakers victory today was the bench. The bench players had their best game of the season led by Huertas, Young &amp; Bass!
The Lakers future looks bright with the young players Russell, Clarkson and Randle!
Laker Nation: The Lakers players executed Coach Scott's defensive plan to perfection!
The Lakers rotated well on defense and never let Golden State get comfortably in their offense.
Laker Nation: The Lakers played the best defense I've seen them play in the last two years.
If MSU defends like they are capable of &amp; rebounds the ball well, they'll have a great chance at getting to the Final 4 &amp; winning a title!
Just like the Warriors are the most entertaining team in the NBA, the Spartans are the most exciting team to watch in College Basketball!
Denzel Valentine is the Best All-Around player in College Basketball and he should be named Player of The Year!

Kevin Durant scored 37pts against the Warriors tonight! I hope the Lakers' Jim Buss was watching, because that's who we need next season.
OKC didn't give the game away, the Warriors came and took it. That's the heart of a champion.
Can you imagine watching OKC vs. Golden State in a 7 game series?! It would be this exciting every game. This is what I'm hoping for.
After watching OKC lose to the Warriors in OT, I still feel they have the best chance to beat them in the playoffs!
...@StephenCurry30 also has a chance to be the most exciting player ever!
.@StephenCurry30 has a chance to be the greatest player we've ever seen, if he plays at this level for the next 4-5yrs!
Steph 46pts, Klay 32pts, KD 37pts &amp; Westbrook 26pts! Wow what a game!
OKC vs. Warriors tonight was the most exciting game I've seen all season.
If @StephenCurry30's game winning 3-pointer doesn't prove he's the greatest shooter we've ever seen, I don't know what will!
Here's more on my conversation at @Target about diversity and inclusion. https://t.co/H9spisAX1H
I'm always reevaluating how to utilize my time. https://t.co/cbwXVWGPgr
...The Warriors are too good on defense, offense and they are very well coached.
If the Golden State Warriors play to their full potential, there's no team that can beat them in a 7 game series in the playoffs.
I didn't think the Warriors could get the Bulls 72-10 record, now I think they will break that record and set a new one!
.@StephenCurry30 is the player everybody wants to watch and the Golden State Warriors are the team everybody wants to watch.
.@StephenCurry30 scored his 51pts in so many different ways, 3 pointers, lay ups, FTs and half court shots! I love watching him play!
.@StephenCurry30 scored 51pts going 20-27 from the field. He's the best athlete in America right now!
Just watched @StephenCurry30 scored 51pts 7reb 8ast in the Golden State win against Orlando!

I loved when @Dame_Lillard scored 51pts against the Warriors after not be chosen for the NBA All-Star Game.
Even in a losing cause, @russwest44 coast to coast dunk was one of the best plays I've seen all season!
The Cavs after a big road win over OKC led by @KingJames 25pts 7reb &amp; 11ast, look like a team that is hitting its stride under Coach Lue.
I have to apologize to @AntDavis23 of the Pelicans who scored 59pts &amp; 20rebs. You are definitely the best big man in the NBA!
Randy Foye to OKC definitely improves their team. He's a proven scorer, defender and will help them off the bench in the playoffs.
Fans of my home state Detroit Pistons should be proud of the job Stan Van Gundy is doing as Pres. of Basketball Operations and Head Coach!
Coach Van Gundy is really building the Pistons in the mold of his old Orland Magic team and we know they were championship caliber.
I'm very impressed with Pistons Coach Stan Van Gundy, trading for Harris, Thornton and Montejunas.
NBA Fans get ready for Saturday night, the Warriors vs. Clippers, Steph vs. Chris! It's going to be must see tv!
Tonight I'll be watching the Spurs vs. Lakers game, even though I know what the outcome is going to be! LOL
Right now the Clippers are the 4th seed. If they can move up, I like their chances of making it to the Western Conference Finals.
Now in the 4th qtr the Clippers can spread the floor with Griffin, Paul, Redick, Green and Crawford. I really like that lineup.
The Clippers struggled because their 4th qtr lineup was not as good as the Warriors, Spurs or Thunder, adding Green changes all of that.
The Clippers really improve their team adding Jeff Green who can play multiple positions, defend and score.
A big congrats to Clippers Coach @DocRivers on trading for the versatile Jeff Green!
Great leadership is dynamic and begins with a strong sense of awareness, dedication to hard work and growth.  https://t.co/ESSBSQLV7P

Zach LaVine &amp; Aaron Gordon had 6 consecutive 50pt dunks. It took me back to MJ vs. Dominique, which I think was the best dunk contest ever!
In my 30+ years in the NBA, I believe it was the 3rd best dunk contest I've ever seen. #NBAAllStarTO

Don't believe me...look at how close all the conference standings are, like the Big Ten, ACC, Big 12, Pac 12, etc...
The reason why is there's no clear cut favorite and I believe there's around 10 or more teams that can win the NCAA Championship.
All of you who haven't been watching College Basketball this season have been missing, I think, the best season ever!

My advice to LeBron, is to be LeBron! @KingJames
If you ran a poll of NBA coaches, I bet all of them would take @KingJames on their team in a heartbeat!
All the greats who are also the leaders of their teams have expressed their opinions in private &amp; public and @KingJames is no different.
...about winning basketball, which is something he knows a lot about!
.@KingJames is probably the smartest player in the NBA with the highest basketball IQ, because of that he has opinions...
.@KingJames led his teams to 6 finals 2 titles &amp; won 4 MVPs w/ those credentials there's NO WAY he can accomplish that &amp; be a "coach killer"
I'm upset that people are labeling the best all around player in the game, @KingJames  a "coach killer."
Hall of Famer Vin Scully, as every MLB fan knows, has the sweetest voice in all of sports!
That would be the perfect way to honor the legendary voice of the @Dodgers, Vin Scully and end a 67 year Hall of Fame career!
I hope the LA City Council votes to rename Elysian Park Avenue, Vin Scully Avenue!
.@paugasol showed Lakers fans last night why we should've done everything we could to keep him, scoring 21pts, 12rebs &amp; 7ast.
.@paugasol of the Chicago Bulls, no question, should be in the NBA All Star Game in Toronto with the season he's having!
Great job by Lakers Owner @JeanieBuss to honor @Shaq with a statue.
Laker fans not only loved @Shaq on the court but off the court as well with his BIG personality and philanthropic efforts in the City of LA!
.@SHAQ captivated the hearts of Laker fans with his dominant performances that led us to a 3-peat!
I'm so happy for @SHAQ, being the next Lakers great to get a statue outside of Staples Center!
.@MSU_Basketball getting great leadership from seniors Forbes Valentine &amp; Costello that's why we've won 2 in a row &amp; playing at a high level

Want to wish my friend Coach Lue good luck as the head coach of the Cavs! Now all the pressure is on the players to deliver a championship.
The Cleveland Cavs owners and players felt that Coach Tyronn Lue gives them a better chance to win the championship.
I feel bad for Coach Blatt being fired from CLE, because he was a highly successful coach in the Euroleague, but was in a tough situation.
The #StarkeyExpo audience had great energy and I was energized as I spoke to them today in Las Vegas!

Draymond Green leads the NBA in triple doubles and he should be a starter in the NBA All-Star Game! @Money23Green
The Golden State Warriors are the best team and the most exciting team in the league.
The Warriors sent the whole league a message tonight, that they are on a mission to win the championship again this season.
Golden State with the lopsided win, let Cleveland know that even if the Cavs were at full strength, they still would've won the championship
As you all know, I'm from Lansing, MI, which is down the street from Flint and I can't believe that this is happening in my home state.

Let me remind everyone, young and old, I played against @iamisiahthomas when he was hurt &amp; hobbling on one leg...
ESPN ranked the Top 10 PGs of all time &amp; they have @iamisiahthomas ranked 5th. There's no way Stockton &amp; Curry are better than Isiah.
LA Rams owner Stan Kroenke will need a point person to represent the Rams in the LA community and to assist with a seamless transition!

I tweeted earlier that the Houston Rockets are not a championship caliber team and so far they have proved me right.
The Rockets have great individual players but they don't have great team players.
If it's true the Houston Rockets fired Coach McHale they made a big mistake.
To me @denzelval45 has improved so much on his leadership and all around game this year. He will make a good NBA player.

The greatest shooters I've ever seen are Stephen Curry, Reggie Miller, Ray Allen, Larry Bird and Jerry West.
I think there is going to be a Game 7.
Golden State doesn't understand how difficult it is going to be to close out the Cavs especially the way LeBron is playing.
Andre Iguodala just has to make one adjustment on his free throw shooting and that's get more lift on his follow through and in his legs!
Stephen Curry has flipped the script on Dellavadova, picking him up on defense  full court and being physical has taken him out of the game.
The reason Golden State is winning this series is because of their great defense which equals good offense.
LeBron has little help and Steph has a lot of help. That's what this series has come down to.
The matchup between LeBron James and Steph Curry has been everything that it was advertised to be.
I guess we won't be hearing anymore about Matthew Dellavadova shutting down Steph Curry after Steph scored 37pts in Game 5.
The 2 best players put on a show in tonight. LeBron James w/ 40pts in a triple double &amp; Steph Curry w/ 37pts to give GS a 3-2 series lead!
Thank you to @GlenLlopis for the invite to the Cultural Shift Executive Summitt and allowing my‚Ä¶ https://t.co/oQxbMdw1U9
There aren't too many adjustments the Cavs can make because of the shortage of personnel.
The Warriors two leaders came to play last night, Curry w/ 22pts and Green w/ 17pts 7reb &amp; 6ast and they both never complained to the refs.
The Warriors' defense, physical play and transition offense was to much for the Cavs to handle.
The next adjustment that Coach Kerr made was playing "small ball", which allowed them to pressure the Cavs full court and wear them down.
The first adjustment Coach Kerr made was starting Andre Iguodala who scored 22pts and played great defense on LeBron James.
Warriors' Coach Steve Kerr gets the game ball after last night's blow out win against the Cavs in Game 4!
I love Okafor because he's won a state championship in HS, NCAA Title at Duke and he can bring that championship pedigree to the Lakers.
Jahlil Okafor worked out for the Lakers on Tuesday.
LeBron, don't listen to anybody, keep shooting as many times as you have to for your team to win!
After the first 3 games LeBron James should be on everybody's Mt. Rushmore...including mine!
The Warriors' Barnes &amp; Bogut are struggling right now, so Coach Kerr must find more time for Iguodala &amp; Lee who both played great in Game 3.
In Game 4 all the Golden State Warriors need to do is play the way they did in 4th qtr of Game 3.
Coach Kerr now must make adjustments on the Cavs pick &amp; roll with LeBron James. They should double team him every time.
Coach Blatt so far has taken Steph Curry out of the game because by double teaming him on every pick &amp; roll.
I love Steph Curry &amp; Draymond Green, but they both need to stop complaining to the referees and play basketball.
The Cavaliers defense has been awesome and they have been physically &amp; mentally tougher than the Warriors.
In the NBA Finals there's always going to be unsung heroes and Matthew Dellavedova is playing that role for the Cavs.
If LeBron keeps playing the way he's playing &amp; the Cavs win the title, this will be the single greatest performance we've seen in the Finals
Great 9-3 win for our Boys In Blue last night over the D-Backs! #Dodgers
I'll be watching Game 3 tonight from the plane back to LA, after I attend the World Affairs Honors Global Education Gala!
Golden State has to play at a faster pace, drive to the basket more and not settle for outside jump shots. #NBAFinals
In Game 3, Stephen Curry will shoot better. He has to move more without the ball.
My advice to LeBron is to keep shooting as much as you have to for your team to win. If that means 30-40 shots take them.
LeBron knows at home his teammates will be better, so he will not have to take as many shots.
LeBron knew he had to be a volume shooter in the 1st 2 games on the road.
I love LeBron's mindset and how he's doing whatever it takes to will his team to victory. Whether it's scoring, rebounding or assists.
LeBron James has been phenomenal in the first two games of the #NBAFinals!
Can't wait for Game 3 of the NBA Finals tonight with the Cavs and Warriors tied at 1-1!

This is the NBA Finals everybody wanted to see, Cavs vs. Warriors and it's finally here! I can't wait!
Congratulations to Golden State Warriors owners Joe Lacob and my friend &amp; business partner Peter Guber on their team reaching the NBA Finals
Congrats to Stephen Curry and the Golden State Warriors on reaching the NBA Finals!
The Cavs are the best defensive team left in the playoffs. They are tough and physical.
Smith, Shumpert, Thompson, Dellavedova &amp; Mozgov all dominated their Hawks counterparts which is why they were able to sweep the Hawks!
LeBron James was nothing short of sensational against the Hawks and he had a lot of help from his teammates!
Congrats to LeBron James and his Cavs teammates on reaching the NBA Finals!

Last night's win was a total team victory! Too many guys to mention everybody that contributed! #Dodgers
Congrats to Adrian Gonzalez on driving in over 1,000 RBIs!
Clayton Kershaw looked like his old dominant self in leading the @Dodgers to an 8-0 victory over the Braves last night!
The basketball world will be treated to a Finals feat. the world's best player LeBron James v. the world's most exciting player Steph Curry!
Sometimes words can't explain just how special LeBron James is, leading his team w/ a triple double 37pts, 18reb, 13ast in the win over ATL.
Give a lot of credit to the Atlanta Hawks, they could've quit but they battled all night and just came up short in OT.
Second win in a row for the Dodgers after tonight's 2-0 win against the Padres! #Dodgers
When Draymond Green was a Sr. at MSU I tweeted that he was the best all-around college player entering the draft and I guess I was right!
All NBA Fans get ready, LeBron James vs. Steph Curry in the NBA Finals. I can't wait!
Steph Curry is not only the NBA MVP, he's also the best entertainer we have in today's game because he's so exciting to watch!
LeBron James was the best point guard on the floor, the best post player on the floor and the best player on the floor tonight!
The Atlanta Hawks are the only team left in the playoffs without a superstar &amp; they've played that way in the first 2 games of this series.
LeBron James played PG and he got everybody involved tonight. His basketball IQ is off the charts!
LeBron was masterful tonight!
LeBron James had one of the best playoff games I've seen him play and he made it look easy! 30pts, 11ast and 9rebs.
Now I'm watching the Rocket vs. Warriors in the WCF and I will have the Dodgers vs. Giants game on at the same time when it starts!
Laker Nation: I'm so happy for Kobe and Lakers fans around the world!

Welcome Back! To Kenley Jansen as he gets his first save in the 1-0 win over the Rockies! #Dodgers
I think the Clippers must make roster changes if they want to get to the Western Conference Finals and the NBA Finals!
Laker Nation: I guarantee we will be better next season. Jim Buss and Mitch Kupchak will have a great offseason!
Laker Nation: We want to bring Coach Scott some luck in NY on Tuesday so wear your Purple &amp; Gold! I will have my Lakers gear on all day!
The Clippers defeat is not on Chris Paul, he played with a lot of heart and energy!
I thought the Spurs taught the Clippers how to win after a tough 7 game series. I was wrong. The Clippers are still the Clippers.
The Clippers organization will always remember not closing out the Rockets in Game 6 at home. That game will always haunt them.
Game Ball goes to ABCs Mike Breen, Mark Jackson &amp; Jeff Van Gundy for pointing out the Clippers lack of intensity in ‚Ä¶ http://t.co/4faf8zlZpr
The Rockets role players played well Pablo Prigioni, Trevor Ariza and Josh Smith!
Game ball goes to MVP candidate James Harden, scoring 31pts and setting his teammates up for great shots with his dribble penetration!
Congrats to the Houston Rockets as they advance to the Western Conference Finals!

Congrats to MVP Steph Curry and the Golden State Warriors on advancing to the Western Conference Finals!
The best two teams in the East during the regular season will face each other in the Eastern Conference Finals! I can't wait!
Congrats to the Atlanta Hawks on going to the Eastern Conference Finals! What an exciting game!
The Clippers are in a world of trouble after not closing out at home in Game 6 and now having to go to Houston for Game 7.
Josh Smith is the hero for the Rockets knocking down 3 three-pointers and scoring 14pts of his 19pts in the 4th quarter!
The Clippers did not close out the 3rd qtr and the Rockets stole the momentum at the beginning of the 4th qtr.
Blake Griffin's acrobatic shot reminded me so much of "Dr. J" Julius Erving!
This offseason the Bulls have to change their team. They have too many players that can't create their own shots.
Congrats to LeBron James and his Cavs on their blowout victory over the Bulls and advancing to the Eastern Conference Finals!
Even at the Clippers game I'm keeping up with my @Dodgers who are up 3-1 in the 5th inning over the Rockies!

I wish the Mayweather-Pacquaio fight was half as exciting as the NBA Playoffs!
The NBA playoffs this year are so good because teams are evenly matched!
The NBA Playoffs are RIDICULOUS! Pierce hits a 3 to go up by 1pt with 8 sec. left &amp; then Horford hits a layup with 1 sec. left to win! WOW!
Thank you to SiriusDecisions Co-Founders Rich Eldh and John Neeson for inviting me to speak to‚Ä¶ https://t.co/yHwuCSqrlE
Just jumped on my plane heading back to LA to watch my @Dodgers and the Clippers game at the same time!
Just got off the stage in Nashville for SiriusDecisions speaking to 2500 people explaining to them how I built my business.
Who's role players will play better tonight? Bulls or Cavs?
The Clippers need to have a "must win" attitude to close out the Rockets tonight and get Chris Paul some rest.
The Atlanta Hawks got back to playing their game and controlling the tempo, that's why they won Game 4 against the Wizards 106-101.
I was very impressed with how the Golden State Warriors responded, especially MVP Steph Curry in the 101-84 victory over the Grizzlies!
Scott Van Slyke's walk-off three run HR in last nights 5-3 win over the Marlins...just amazing! #Dodgers

I'm going to miss Tom Brady's championship pedigree for those 4 games, he's the reason I watch the Patriots every Sunday!
With Tom Brady being suspended for  4 games, the Commissioner came down hard &amp; fair. Tom, the fans will miss you for those games!
The Atlanta Hawks have to prove to the Wizards and themselves that they are the better team tonight, especially if Wall does not play.
The Grizzlies front line of Gasol and Randolph have been dominating the Warriors in the paint, will it continue tonight?
I wonder what adjustments MVP Steph Curry and Klay Thompson will make against the superb defense of Mike Conley and Tony Allen tonight?
Welcome back to Dodger Stadium tonight, one of my favorite former Dodgers, Dee Gordon!
Come out to Dodger Stadium tonight to see Zack Greinke (5-0) get the start against the Marlins!
The @Dodgers are off to a fantastic 20-10 start and it has been a total team effort!
Thank you to Tim Duncan, Kobe Bryant and LeBron James for your contribution to the NBA!
Three future Hall Of Famers that could've played when MJ, Bird and I were playing are Tim Duncan, Kobe Bryant and LeBron James.
Coach Blatt is blessed to have the best player, LeBron James, as his team leader and coach on the floor!
I would love to see LeBron James and the Cavs vs. Chris Paul and the Clippers in the NBA Finals. What a matchup that would be!
King James showed us why he's the best player in basketball with his game winner in Chicago yesterday!
These playoffs have been outstanding with great games and buzzer beaters from Derrick Rose, Paul Pierce and LeBron James!
Before teams could take Blake out of the game with physical play, but now he's broken through and trying to lead the Clippers to the Finals!
Blake Griffin reminds me of Scottie Pippen. Scottie didn't like the physicality of the Pistons but broke through in '91.
The Pistons taught the Bulls how to win and it looks like the Spurs have taught the Clippers how to win.
Clippers vs. Spurs in Rd 1 reminded me of the Bulls vs. Pistons.
If the Clippers end up winning they would have to thank the Spurs, for pushing them to play at a higher level.
...the Clippers have outside shooting, Blake is dominating, the best leader and coach in Chris Paul &amp; Doc Rivers and great team defense!
I never thought I would say this, but I think the Clippers can win the NBA Championship. They have a little bit of everything...
I've watched all the teams in playoffs and right now the Clippers are playing better than any team left!
It's plain and simple, the Clippers are just a better team than the Houston Rockets.

The Cavs made adjustments, now let's see if the Rockets make adjustments in their Game 2.
The Cavs frontline of Mozgov &amp; Thompson pushed the Bulls frontline of Gasol &amp; Noah around and were more physical in Game 2.
LeBron James showed us again why he's the best player on the planet scoring 33pts to lead his Cavs in the Game 2 win over the Bulls.
I think we're all hoping Chris Paul will play tonight! If not tonight, then in Game 3 in LA!
I'm interested in seeing the adjustments James Harden and the Rockets make tonight against Blake Griffin and the Clippers!
Looking forward to seeing how LeBron and the Cavs rebound in Game 2 vs. the Bulls tonight!
