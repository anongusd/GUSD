.@RepRooney, the most aggressive House Republican on combating climate change, takes the bright side on not being named by GOP leadership to Pelosi's climate committee: "It shows they are not quite where I am yet, and it makes me feel really good about being where I am."

ICYMI: My exclusive interview with Steven Koonin, a former Obama official who at the best of his good friend William Happer is shaping Trump's plan to challenge climate change science https://t.co/S9e6M5OgD4
NEWS you missed: My exclusive interview with Steven Koonin, a former Obama official, about why he's helping Trump establish a committee to challenge climate change science. Michael Cohen hearing is on break, so re-upping this to capture your eyes and ears https://t.co/S9e6M5OgD4
But Koonin insists his motives are genuine. “I don't agree with everything this president is doing,” he told me of Trump. “I try to make a positive difference where I can. If I can advise on getting the dialogue on climate science to a better state, I will do that.” [End thread]
“There is zero chance that some slapdash band of climate contrarians assembled by the current White House will have any impact whatever on the key scientific understandings of what is going on," Holdren said.
Koonin's former Obama admin colleague, John Holdren, who was White House science adviser, said Koonin has a tendency to "quibble about points in climate science where there are uncertainties.”
George David Banks, President Trump's former international energy adviser, is skeptical of that approach. "Any kind of objective analysis of climate change is going to result in a conclusion that there is a national security impact,” he told me.
The 2nd phase of the initiative, Koonin said, would use the findings of the science review and apply it to national security policy.		That effort could conflict with the findings of the national security &amp; intelligence communities that climate change threatens national security.
The committee would then send an evaluation of the assessment to the National Academy of Sciences, a private group of researchers, for review. “If this is a bunch of administration hacks who write an adversarial review, the academy will call them out," Koonin said.
Koonin said the committee would probe the science underlying the National Climate Assessment, which concluded that climate change is already affecting the country and is caused by humans.
Along with sharing new details about the White House's planned climate skeptic committee, Koonin aggressively defends Happer, who has been criticized for his extreme comments on Co2 and climate change. Koonin calls Happer a "good scientist" who is not a "demon or ideologue."
Koonin is best known for being recruited by former EPA administrator Scott Pruitt to lead a "red team/blue team" debate of climate science, but then-chief of staff John Kelly canceled the project. Now he's back, with the prodding of his long-time friend, the NSC's William Happer

@Bankfieldbecky @NEF @powellds @melpete_ Thanks for sharing! I appreciate that
“People in coal country don’t want to go on public assistance,” the group's founder told me. “That isn't going to connect with mining communities. We're proud to have powered this country's growth for generations. We want to contribute to our country in other ways.”
Groups already working on the transition say they've seen progress: @CoalfieldTweets in W.V. has trained 800 workers since 2010, while helping launch 50 businesses creating 190 jobs, including 1 for a former coal mining electrician who now runs a biz installing rooftop solar
Mike Cope, president of the Ohio Coal Assoc., said his group would not reject outreach from #GreenNewDeal but prefers gov. help to save the industry. “We are always willing to engage people who want to learn,” Cope told me. "But they are wrong. The coal industry is not dead.”
The leaders of coal groups naturally oppose any government-mandated plan to kill the industry. “This is a feel-good deal," Bill Raney, president of @WV_coal1 told me of the #GreenNewDeal. "We get a lot of help we are not looking for sometimes.”
Carlock envisions a suite of federal programs to help coal communities transition. He sees the #GreenNewDeal providing job training, in addition to interim help such as unemployment benefits, mortgage relief, child care aid, and healthcare, as well as shoring up miners’ pensions
Green New Deal supporters aim to visit soon with Appalachian coal communities -- potentially hostile territory: “You overcome the perception about the Green New Deal by engaging in conversation on where they see themselves in the energy transition,” @gregorytcarlock told me.

Smart money for ranking member should focus on Rep. Jim Sensenbrenner of Wisconsin, a  skeptic who was the top Republican on a previous version of the committee, or @garretgraves, a more moderate member who represents a coastal district and is active on climate adaptation issues
For example energy committee leaders like @repgregwalden and @RepShimkus aren't interested. Freshmen who ran on clean energy platforms such as @RepMichaelWaltz and @reptimmons also won't be on the committee, despite groups pushing for them to be considered.
Indications are McCarthy, known as a consensus-builder, will try to strike a middle ground. But Republicans have had trouble finding willing members to serve on the committee, revealing the emerging GOP division on the issue
But other conservative groups such as @ceidotorg that are skeptical of climate change and government policies to confront it want Republicans to approach the climate committee with a wrecking-ball mentality
Some groups, such as @jharrell and @ClearPathFound are pushing for Republicans to use the committee, which is mostly symbolic and has no power to write legislation, to shape actual climate policy in a more conservative direction.

@Bulls_Peck True. But I really doubt players care what Bobby Portis' says. He's an unproven player with a one-dimensional skill set. The Bulls were full of non self-aware players who don't know their roles (Jabari and I'm also looking at you Denzel Valentine) and overvalue themselves.
@Bulls_Peck Fair enough. That complaint isn't unique to GarPax though. Rarely do you hear a player who was traded without demanding a trade have positive things to say afterwards. That's business. Opportunities present themselves unexpectedly. GarPax said the Wiz contacted them dangling Otto
@Bulls_Peck His comment about being mad GarPax didn't want to pay him shows a lack of self-awareness. He knew he would have been the 3d big on a team built around the two bigs in front of him. Pax was quite transparent about that, and why it wouldn't make sense to devote so much to 3 bigs.

@KsteinEnergy @ShaneSkelton Did you read the full story? It's not completely framed around polling. And the story is not just about electoral consequences. I quoted Republicans who believe climate change is a problem that requires policy to fix.
@MikeBastasch Did I say it was? Also, I’m reporting what people tell me. I don’t have an opinion as a reporter
@MikeBastasch That was a decade ago. I think the point made by sources in the story is with climate elevated as an issue -- and agree with GND or not, we are all talking about it -- GOP must be more proactive, than reactive, and propose policy. We'll have to see how the issue plays in 2020
.@ShaneSkelton, former Paul Ryan adviser, said GOP should tread carefully on #GreenNewDeal w/ polls showing more concern of climate change: "It's always better to say I have a better solution to your problem than to say you don't have a problem, and I don't want to talk about it"
Even Trump's former international energy adviser, George David Banks, sees areas of cooperation with the #GreenNewDeal. “If you are looking at developing a national climate policy....the majority of their climate policy reflects a centrist position.”
Or as @jneeley78 tells it: “If the Green New Deal goes down in flames, the climate issue is still out there. You still have to come up with ways to deal with it.”
“We should entertain the competition of ideas, not duck it," former congressman @bobinglis tells

Moderate Democrats, such as 2020 presidential candidate @JohnKDelaney, are also cheering the change: “If we’re serious about fighting climate change, the goal has to be reducing GHG emissions. Renewable energy is an important means to that end, but not the goal in and of itself.”
Hat tip to @zcolman on first reporting on this modification. I got green groups to respond to the change, and many are OK with it. "We have always recognized there will be a transition to no fossil fuels," Bill Snape of @CenterForBioDiv tells me

Also see @JohnDSiciliano's related story on how Saudi ownership of the largest US refinery could insulate it from Trump's sanctions https://t.co/760dXykBTs
.@AmyJaffeenergy sees a lesson from Trump's continued leaning on Saudis. “The days when the U.S. had a hotline directly to Saudi Arabia on oil policy are over. We are in a different world today. The best way forward is to continue to lower the oil intensity of the U.S. economy.”
Saudi's medium sour grade of oil is a good enough substitute for the sludgy, heavy stuff from Venezuela but Saudis feel burned by Trump's sanctions waivers for Iran oil buyers, which came after the Saudis began boosting supply. Now Saudis are committed to new OPEC-cutting pact

@suntimes_hoops Dude the percentages between the chances for top 3 picks and top 5 are miniscule. You are overplaying the taking narrative
@mkhoops I also think the Bulls as currently construed (with Markannen, LaVine and Carter needing touches) need a pass-first PG with good instincts and vision. Ball fits the bill better than score-first (and badly) Dunn
@Bulls_Peck @cbefred @Kevin_NBCS True. They both should not be part of the future. But I can see GarPax clinging to Bobby as its precious core dwindles, with Dunn also clearly not a fit anymore.
@Bulls_Peck @cbefred @Kevin_NBCS I agree, but is there any evidence Parker is worse than Portis? Portis is a lesser version who takes away shots from Lauri. I would be trying to deal him now. Parker can at least play the faster modern style. Portis is almost as bad at D, without the offensive skills.

The thread is in response to our story about progressives growing wary of carbon pricing https://t.co/REgQbiiHi8 https://t.co/z7QyPZ26O7
Supportive Republicans see an opening if progressives downplay carbon pricing in favor of other GND priorities. "It gives conservatives room to start developing their own ideas, and that’s where a market-driven approach like carbon pricing can blossom," @carloslcurbelo told me.
Some Dems. are pushing back, arguing carbon pricing is the only way to reduce emissions in all sectors, including electricity, transport, and manufacturing. “There is not any scenario where we lower carbon to the level we need and don’t include a price on it” @SeanCasten told me.
"A carbon price is one tool,” @gregorytcarlock,"Green New Deal" research director at @DataProgress, told me. “But it is insufficient as the only piece. My gravest concern is we try for what is most likely to pass in a bipartisan sense, but punt the issue of decarbonization."

@KCJHoop It's clear by now LaVine and Dunn don't work together. Neither are good decision makers, or value the ball. Dunn can't shoot and both need the ball to be effective. GarPax has to be decisive move off one of them (likely Dunn) &amp; find a modern PG who can shoot 3s and run an offense

The bipartisan group of economists is broadly endorsing a carbon tax and dividend proposal authored by @TheCLCouncil, which has the support of oil &amp; gas companies. @conocophillips and @exxonmobil have donated to the advocacy arm of that coalition.
“This statement represents a major tipping point in U.S. climate policy,” Yellen said. “It shows broad agreement among economists and experienced policymakers that carbon dividends is the most cost-effective, equitable and politically-viable climate solution.”
It also includes former Fed chairmen Alan Greenspan and Ben Bernanke, appointed by Republicans, Paul Volcker, appointed by a Democrat and re-appointed by a Republican, and Janet Yellen, appointed by a Democrat
The coalition supporting a carbon tax and dividend includes the top economic advisers to Presidents Gerald Ford, Ronald Reagan, George H.W. Bush, Bill Clinton, George W. Bush, and Barack Obama.

One big question climate advocates have, is what role carbon pricing has in the Green New Deal. @saikatc tells me progressives are not dismissing it, but view carbon pricing as a "tiny part" of a bigger policy. "The debate over carbon pricing to me isn’t all that interesting."
.@AOC's chief of staff, @saikatc, explains the Green Deal to me this way: "What we are imagining is a World War II-scale mobilization of our economy that is set around the objective of reversing the climate crisis and having a 100 percent greenhouse-gas-free economy in 10 years."
Khanna gave an example of pieces of legislation that could become part of the Green New Deal: He said he plans to introduce a bill that expands the EV tax credit and links it to a requirement for automakers to build their electric cars in the U.S.
Democrats challenged to turn the Green New Deal into real policy. "The call for a Green New Deal is poetry, and now we need to get to prose," @RoKhanna tells me. Freed from paywall, my latest @dcexaminer magazine story  https://t.co/LFJCOvXhsR
@chicagobulls Not looking like it. The Bulls starting 5 stinks, especially on offense, and that starts with a point guard who can't shoot 3s or get to the free-throw line. Kris is a feisty role player, but he needs the ball like LaVine, and is ineffective off the ball. The fit doesn't work

GOP leadership is not far along in deciding what type of Republican to put on the climate committee. But @RepRooney fears the choice will be made based on seniority. Senenbrenner was ranking member of previous version of the panel.
.@RepRooney says he would use the climate committee to advance his preference for a carbon tax and dividend policy. Sensenbrenner, however, opposes government solutions, and wants to make sure the GOP platform is not "Green Revolution-light.”
Climate advocate Republicans outside Congress, meanwhile, are making their preference known. “This is an incredible opportunity for Republicans to reset on climate change and step forward with free enterprise solutions and engage constructively,” @bobinglis told me
.@RepRooney says it would be a bad sign for GOP to choose Sensenbrenner, who tells me he doesn't think humans are the main cause of climate change. "It might be interpreted as a less than positive thing if someone who is made ranking member doesn't care about climate change."
The choice, to be made by GOP Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, will tell us a lot about how Republicans plan to approach the issue of climate change going into 2020

@chicagobulls Great but is he a three-point threat in real games? No
Bernhardt is working his dream job, doing policy behind the scenes. But allies say he's built for a bigger role. “He has more experience in that building working on these issues than any predecessor," says Jon Hrobsky, a former Interior colleague of the George W. Bush admin.
Others like Rep. Jeff Denham, R-Calif., and Sen. Dean Heller, R-Nev., are interested in the job, but seen as less serious contenders. The lack of a definitive favorite among lawmakers and former congressmen could move Trump back to David Bernhardt, Interior's deputy secretary
My look at the latest on Trump's search to replace Ryan Zinke at Interior, which could end where it started. Others in the mix include Rep. Steve Pearce, R-N.M. &amp; former Rep. Cynthia Lummis, R-Wyo. https://t.co/skyfcbssCO

@Bulls_Peck And now he injured Bobby by playing him non-stop coming off a knee injury. This Road Dog breaks everything

@mkhoops Haha probably. Well, every Road Dog needs to be able to juggle a few tricks

And it goes without saying, this bill would have to be introduced again next Congress, and has a slim chance of becoming law under the Trump administration.
What's the significance of the bill? @citizensclimate says "It is unprecedented to see both the House and Senate taking up bipartisan carbon pricing legislation at the same time. Ambitious carbon pricing is gaining momentum."
Flake, who is retiring, also recently challenged Republicans to do more after the UN IPCC report, calling it "pretty dire." He added of climate change: "I hope that we can move along with the rest of the world and address this."
Flake, if you remember, as a former House member co-sponsored the last bipartisan carbon tax bill introduced in 2009 by @bobinglis
This is matching legislation to the bipartisan carbon tax and dividend House bill introduced last month by @RepTedDeutch, @RepRooney, @RepBrianFitz and others.

Republican allies say Manchin can deal with it: “Joe Manchin can handle pressure, my gosh,” @BillCassidy told me. “He is a moderate to conservative Democrat in a state that is very Republican and in a party that is very liberal. So he will find his own way."
But Manchin will clearly face competing pressures, from his constituents and allies, and from more liberal Democrats. “He is going to have a challenge there,” @SenCapito tells me. “I hope he stays as strong for our state representing the fossil fuel industry."
Examples Republican senators gave for possible cooperation on emissions-reductions measures include carbon capture and storage, advanced nuclear, and infrastructure
“Joe is bipartisan and really is an all-of-the-above guy,” @SenJohnHoeven tells me. "He doesn't just say it. He is for traditional energy — fossil fuels — and renewables too.”
Manchin clearly loves coal, and we all know about his antics to kill (literally) cap and trade. But Republicans insist they can work with him on clean energy development, in a piecemeal manner that recognizes the elusiveness of comprehensive climate legislation
Republican senators tell me they are eager for Joe Manchin to rise on energy panel — and not because he supports coal https://t.co/HT5nX4yPLP

@markstrot At point do we acknowledge that GarPax has assembled an ill-fitting roster with players who have little feel for the game? This isn't a coaching thing. LaVine and Dunn, who mostly handle the ball, have had turnover problems their entire career. Parker is also a problem here.
@JasonBordoff Check out our take on the progress of CCS, with insight from @CarbonWrangler of @ColumbiaUEnergy: https://t.co/7LaShQSCbK
As a new @GlobalCCS report lays out today, CCS is also needed for industrial sources, which are 21% of global GHG emissions. “We have to decarbonize the industrial sector to meet our carbon goals."
Here's @CarbonWrangler's take, referencing EPA's term rejecting a CCS requirement on new coal: “Of course, CCS has been adequately demonstrated. We know the costs, performance, risks, and timeline for construction. How much demonstration do you need?”
Bill Brown, CEO of Net Power, which is testing a CCS tech that it hopes can be used on natural gas and coal plants, told me: "The business perspective is different than the political. Anyone looking at building new coal or natural gas is considering how to do it with CCS."
Carbon capture industry says Trump EPA is wrong to underestimate them. My latest is on the status of a technology seen as crucial to combating climate change. https://t.co/NafTes2vCm
@cbefred Nah. He has proven to have no feel for the game. Can't teach that. The being young excuse doesn't work anymore.
@StephNoh It's not only talent or being a young team. The Bulls have assembled a low IQ roster outside Lauri and Wendall. A mish mosh of players, many selfish and with no feel for the game. Look at the difference with a also young Kings team, with guys who play smart
@mkhoops @cbefred Yes! I look forward to the banter between you two on the next pod. I am always on call as a middle-ground mediator, if need be.
@mkhoops @cbefred Hahaha. I have to say: See Red is a long-time Twitter follower of mine. Mark, you can win me back by following suit.
@mkhoops @cbefred I never thought I could count See Red Fred as an ally, but here we are
@mkhoops Haha! I just feel like the anti-Boylen side has spun out of control, mostly based on snarky reactions from national reporters who don't have sourcing like @KCJHoop
@mkhoops Hatred of GarPax is coloring the reaction to this controversy. The mutiny by a few players was an over-reaction. Just as Boylen has little cache to cite Pop for his tactics, players like Lavine who have won nothing have 0 credibility to complain about wind sprints and extra work.
@Bulls_Peck The option is for this season
@Bulls_Peck On another note, how can Cam Payne keep getting chances? The dude should not be on an NBA roster.  Weird "accountability" message to keep him and demote Blakeney.
@Bulls_Peck Nah. Unfair. Blakeney was one of the guys reporters cited as putting up shots after the weird meetings. It's just clear he isn't in the rotation with Dunn back and Shaq Harrison playing well.
“I didn’t know I had the intestinal fortitude to do it,” Meadows told me about the Boehner move, which rankled some of the conservative colleagues. “You look at the consequences and it’s not an easy thing to do, especially for a guy who likes people. I like to be liked."

For his part @EPAAWheeler said he is "encouraging" investment in CCS. He just doesn't think the government should mandate it. As Holmstead added: "It's really important [for climate change] to lower the cost of CCS. But this kind of regulatory mandate does not really help."
Former Obama EPA attorney @JosephGoffman, however, argues the premise of the Trump rule change is wrong: “CCS is not a hypothetical option,” he told me. “It is in operation."
So why act if there is likely little impact? As former George W. Bush EPA official Jeff Holmstead tells me: "It’s party symbolic. The administration wants to show they are supportive of new coal fired power plants."

There's a caveat with low prices. “The assertion that prices went down recently thanks to Saudi Arabia and that we should keep going lower also shows how little the president understands about what will happen when prices go too low in places like Texas, New Mexico, North Dakota"

But to be real, some Dems. who never bought the sincerity of Republicans on the climate caucus say the loss of GOP members should force the group to fold. “In most cases they cast bad votes. It's a caucus that stands for little. That's why I haven't joined,” @GerryConnolly says
Even some Democrats want the climate caucus to live on, knowing big legislation must be bipartisan to pass. “It would be a mistake to discount Republican voices because that would prevent us from building the coalition we need over the next 20 years," @RoKhanna tells me

But enviro. groups like @CenterForBioDiv favor the Bernie Sanders/Al Gore scorched-earth approach to fracking, saying climate change demands faster action: "The idea of natural gas being a transitional fuel is a dangerous myth." Hence the split in Colorado. End thread
Center-left groups like @ThirdWayEnergy, also don't like Colorado's ballot measure, and resist calls from the Dem. base to ban fracking. "There are better ways to go about addressing concerns regarding natural gas. Bernie Sanders speaks for a small portion of the base."
“I recognize I am putting gas in my car and heating my home with natural gas," Becker continues. "So I recognize reality. I also want to see a transition to renewable energy that is responsible and quick.”
Digging into this a bit more: @kcbecker, the Col. House Majority Leader, encapsulates the dilemma facing Democrats. She supports #Prop112 to curb fracking, but is careful. “If I were drafting it, I would have done it differently," she tells me. “I am not trying to ban fracking."

@paulgallagher Is the basement gym lonely these days? 😂
While passing the carbon fee would be a major signal, the immediate impact on emissions could be small. Washington barely uses coal, and has one of the cleanest energy grids in the country. Bigger impact could be from using revenue to boost public transit, and encourage EVs
@paulgallagher Thanks, Paul! Hope things are good with you
Oil &amp; gas majors are mostly opposed to Washington state's carbon fee, but some like Exxon and Shell aren't actively lobbying against it. Many of them back a revenue-neutral carbon tax plan proposed by free-market groups at the federal level, so they are being careful
Washington voters rejected a carbon tax in 2016, but this year's version has broader support bc it would spend the revenue on clean energy projects, electrification, and climate resilience. Supporters say votes are tight: “I am not sleeping a whole lot of nights"
The consequences of failure, however, are also steep for carbon tax proponents. "If a blue state fails again to pass a carbon tax, it certainly doesn't look good for efforts in states elsewhere, and at the federal level," says @noahqk

FEMA, HUD, and the Army Corps. are among the agencies that had begun implementing policy to reflect the Obama flood standard. But that process has stopped since Trump revoked it. The Trump admin. claims it is still working on replacing it, but stakeholders see little evidence. https://t.co/RfxdQY3f3a
Why did Trump eliminate the flood standard? Bc it mentioned climate change as worsening future flood risk. But "if you are providing incentives to build in places that are risky, that is something anybody committed to the free market has to be concerned about," @RSI says https://t.co/ncMDC2bHji
