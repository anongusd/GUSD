No shame for fame. Killer's daughter hopes to cash in on women's murders.	Local media figures seek notoriety.	Elected officials are rumored to be considering statue for city hall. Museum or theme park plans under consideration to be linked with new baseball stadium? #Wichita #BTK https://t.co/4xGC3tginq
Across the country, the majority of poor families are spending more than half of their already small incomes just to cover rent. And while median rent has increased 70 percent over the past two decades, housing conditions haven't improved, according to a 2015 Harvard study.	True. https://t.co/btpO7F75bJ
International Women's Day.	Alcohol was illegal in Wichita and #Kansas.	Carry Nation: a member of the temperance movement who described herself	as "a bulldog running along at the feet of Jesus, barking at what He doesn't like", was notable for attacking bars. 	#Wichita jailed her. https://t.co/AAmT21edLM
It will take hundreds, if not thousands, of the city's much less affluent homes to make up for the huge, unjustifiable tax breaks the most expensive homes enjoy - thanks to elected officials, at both the local and state level: a clear violation of the 14th Amendment.	#Malfeasance https://t.co/rFGOiFf2z0

#JimmyKimmel was once "poking" fun, but now hosts a show giving women naked men holding their "swords" as awards.	#Wichita may be a _hithole when it comes to how it treats its actors, but Hollywood's a much bigger one, made all the more outrageous by its "holier than thou" 'tude. https://t.co/OHueLlSJmg
@FoxNews "I sincerely hope I will always be a credit to my race and the motion picture industry," sobbed Wichita-born, Hattie McDaniel, as she accepted her #Oscar, as the first Black to win one.	But, she had to sit at the back.	Sadly, Alone.	#Hollywood = hypocrisy.	https://t.co/mmHVE7Nay9
Once upon a time, #JimmyKimmel poked fun at Wichitawesome.	Wichita responded with an official city hall response.	It was absolutely awful.	With well-paid public servants in charge of the local reputation, further criticisms often seem pointless. Who else could prove so degrading. https://t.co/UBghmhpoOy
@Reuters Jimmy Kimmel was hosting a show giving women naked men holding their "swords" for awards. Truly a celebration of gender equality, artistic diversity. Wow	That #JimmyKimmel, always the funny man. What a joker.	How appropriate for a "holier than thou" place.	https://t.co/kDFKxCA8jr

As Mammy, the maid of Scarlett O'Hara in "Gone With the Wind", Hattie McDaniel won the 1940 Academy Award, becoming the first minority actor to win an Oscar. 	All of the film's black actors, including Hattie, were barred from attending the film's premiere in 1939, in Atlanta, Ga. https://t.co/DSbwByE7GI
"I sincerely hope I will always be a credit to my race and the motion picture industry," sobbed Wichita-born, Hattie McDaniel, as she accepted her #Oscar as the first Black to win one.	"There are only eighteen inches between a pat on the back and a kick in the rump." — Hattie McD https://t.co/eIn7uE2RrK
@GeeksOfColor @Lupita_Nyongo @DanaiGurira @Winston_Duke "I sincerely hope I will always be a credit to my race and the motion picture industry," sobbed Wichita-born, Hattie McDaniel, as she accepted her #Oscar, as the first African-American to win an Academy Award. 	Sadly, too, this trailblazing actress is almost completely forgotten. https://t.co/PE3IcRT2rs
@GMA @matthewjdowd Chosen to faithfully represent the best interests of the electorate, it is rare that is the course these public officials steer, thinking themselves "leaders" as opposed to servants; duty-bound to seek what is best for all, but, instead searching only what is best for themselves. https://t.co/8y1TibodnC

Hattie McDaniel was born in Wichita. Her parents were former slaves and her father fought in the Civil War with the 122nd United States Colored Troops. McDaniel has two stars on the Hollywood Walk of Fame; one for her acting and one for her radio work.	#Wichita rarely claims her. https://t.co/AjXAup1c4M
#Wichita-born, Hattie McDaniel, was the first African-American to win an Oscar as Best Actress in a Supporting Role as Mammy in "Gone with the Wind" (1939).	She became the first black to attend the Academy Awards as a guest, not a servant ― mostly forgotten by her place of birth. https://t.co/zVghLokQtp
Hattie McDaniel was born June 10, 1895 in Wichita, Kansas.	McDaniel was the first African-American woman to sing on radio (1915, in Denver, Co); the first African-American to be buried in Los Angeles' famous Rosedale Cemetery.	Hattie is virtually overlooked by her place of birth. https://t.co/7sLdKPeuBC
October 28, 2016. Reported by KSN: KKK flyers discovered in southeast Wichita neighborhood	"KSN News went to the neighborhood and found the flyers wrapped in a rubber band with a sucker attached to them. The flyers ask people to join the KKK." 	Found in District 3 in #Wichita, KS https://t.co/ZZEY1N6nTb
"In #Wichita, Kansas, I heard a young college student say the kinds of things that were being said in all the cities. He recounted an injustice done him in that community. He showed wounds where he had been beaten by white men."	― author, John Howard Griffin, in "#Black Like Me". https://t.co/tSUl4QuYEW
On the day of the big baseball game, 6,000 KKK members resided in Wichita. Publisher, William Allen White, called the Klan a “self-constituted body of moral idiots.”	The contest was played in 102-degree heat with searing winds which The #Wichita Eagle described as a “novel game”. https://t.co/LiGXqD1VUF
On the day of the big ballgame, blacks were less than 10 percent of Wichita’s total residents. One of five blacks, 1,300 total, were living "far below the level of decency and comfort. Housing had become more segregated with many living in 'squatter-towns' at the city’s margins." https://t.co/OpVgj7adt5
"Strangle holds, razors, horsewhips, and other violent implements of argument will be barred at the baseball game at Island Park when the baseball club of #Wichita Klan Number 6, goes up against the Wichita Monrovians, Wichita's crack colored team."	Monrovians beat the Klan 10-8. https://t.co/jRx2uS4yZw
In Wichita's early years, the KKK was alive and well, hosting parades, donating to Wesley Hospital (founded in 1912 by the Methodist Church), providing an American flag and pole to the Riverside Church of Christ.	Those were historical times some remember wistfully as better days. https://t.co/wek4eu14K2
The sheets may be on the beds or in the linen closets today, but the mentalities of those who wore them in years gone by are alive and well.	Corrupt politicians, oppressive rich, slumlords, thieves, bigots and racists maintain a firm stranglehold on the city of shame and secrets. https://t.co/7pBMdkkL2O
