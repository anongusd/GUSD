@JASONRYAN209 @boileralum85 @CrowLon @RepMarkGreen Unfortunately for Trump &amp; his blind supporters, the U.S. isn't a dictatorship so he can't get whatever he wants. 2018 voters overwhelmingly decided the House should be controlled by Dems, and Dems are listening to their constituents. Trump's whining can't change those facts. Sad!
@JASONRYAN209 @boileralum85 @CrowLon @RepMarkGreen Point is the Senate 2 weeks ago was willing to find common ground to avoid a government shutdown. Unless you're advocating for indefinite shutdown, both chambers of Congress aren't really the problem. It lies solely w/the person who said he'd be proud to shut down the government.
@boileralum85 @CrowLon @RepMarkGreen Two weeks ago the Senate passed the same bill Pelosi just passed. They had the votes and now they don't because Trump has said he doesn't support it. Therefore, Trump is the actual hold up here.
@RepMarkGreen Why don't you call out the McConnell-controlled Senate for supporting the same funding bill two weeks ago?

@RIFT_Church @schelske Also, a death sentence costs more money in the end vs. life without parole.
@seeitspeakit @GovInslee The death penalty does not deter murderers. I encourage u to research the case for abolishing the death penalty. Even if u dont agree starting out, its eye opening to read that it doesnt deter, costs more, and is applied in a discriminatory way. This is confirmed by many studies.
@jeremybrumbaugh @EssexKIRO7 @NEWSGUYSULLY With something as flawed as the death penalty, there are many legit abolishment reasons to cite.
@JacobFloat @AmeriWify @AP https://t.co/ff18izxD2G
@ZhiyiApple @BFMradio That's not what this means. It means we're better as a society and have superior morals than the awful criminals who kill and molest people. And we don't stand for discrimination and cruel &amp; unusual punishment. The rest of the civilized world has reached that conclusion already.
@JacobFloat @1cuteOne @amnestyusa It's been proven time and time again that the death penalty is not a deterrent. Get a new excuse for supporting discriminatory government-sponsored murder.
@Javiskeleton_ Against. It's morally wrong to allow jurors or judges to have the power to kill anyone. And as many studies &amp; the Washington S.C. have outlined, those jurors &amp; judges can't keep their bias out of when they do/do not apply it. It therefore is not only immoral but unconstitutional.
