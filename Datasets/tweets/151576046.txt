@MSNBC Let the avg. every day working Trump supporter learn the hard way. I almost hate to say that, but it's the cold hard facts. I don't feel 1 bit sorry for them. What the fuck do you think would happen hiring a bunch of rich &amp; careless people? GTFO.
@mayaharris_ @Amtrak @KamalaHarris @JoeBiden Omg!
@RepJayapal Go, go, go Dems! 		I'd like to get back on Government health care. It blows away private health care. The Gov. actually had nurses on deck &amp; they only visit like once or twice a year. It worked so nice. Less complications. Less hassle. More freedom.
@StevesCorner I am sure that the UK health care system is stronger than the United States  for now. The United States is a mess with this President. Check into it. Sign up. Look into it.

@SpeakerPelosi @HouseDemocrats Sounds fair to me. Sounds like the House majority of D's will do their job &amp; pass the ball over to Trump, McConnell &amp; the majority of Republicans in the Senate. If you play it smart &amp; budge a little, people will see who is to blame for it. #TrumpShutdown
@TiffanyDCross Trump is extremely difficult to deal with &amp; work with any way you look @ it. The guy is not consistent. He can't negotiate or make a deal. That video of him with Nancy &amp; Chuck don't help his case what so ever. Starts @ the top, girl. #TrumpShutdown
@TiffanyDCross The House, a majority of D's have done their job now. People have to Remember that. They have done their part &amp; passed bills over to the Senate, which is McConnell &amp; a Republican majority. the Senate leaders &amp; members won't vote on it. They are not working.
@TiffanyDCross Trump is on video saying he'd own it. I do think Nancy Pelosi &amp; other D's should budge though just a little bit. They have to be smart &amp; think about those hurting people. I think most people blame Trump/McConnell &amp; Senate GOP. The ball is in their park now.
