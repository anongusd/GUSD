@egavactip the state is to actively defend the ability of doctors/staff/clinic escorts to ensure safe, accessible, and confidential care. 		END
@egavactip So the tl;dr version is that I never actually expected to be attacked in liberal Montgomery County, and I CERTAINLY never expected the police to not give a shit. It really opened my eyes to reality of how utterly stigmatised abortion care is and how unwilling (cont.)
@egavactip And I tried, just to keep her away from patients for as long as possible, but the bureaucracy would only give me the police report w/her personal information redacted, so I couldn't even actually FILE charges as I had to way of finding her address or having her served. (cont.)
@egavactip However, what was *most* shocking to me was that even the .@mcpnews, despite video evidence of the trespassing and altercation, refused to do anything because it wasn't witnessed by them. They said I could file charges myself if I wanted to. (cont.)
@egavactip towards me, screaming that I was a baby-killer and agent of Satan, and shocked me by trying to slap my phone out of my hand and take it. When I informed her I was calling the police, as her actions clearly constituted assault, she got in her car and left the scene. (cont.)
@egavactip which was really just to force local tv stations to be forced to give her &amp; her co-candidate equal airtime for their vile propaganda - wasn't content with merely trespassing on private property. Instead, as I video-taped her on said property, not engaging, she advanced (cont.)
@egavactip My first personal encounter with a true anti-abortion extremist was completely terrifying, surreal, &amp; very informative of the realities that provides/staff face from these lunatics. The woman, Missy Smith - you may know here from her fringe run for US VP, (cont.)
@egavactip HAHAHAHHAHA hey, that was my punishment at the same age for using a "bad word" which as I recall was 'hell.' 		Given that I was sent to a lunatic Missouri-Synod Evangelical Lutheran school, where hell was a frequent topic, it was my first introduction to utter hypocrisy...

@smsaideman I'm sure there is quite a lot the US could be doing on that issue, assuming we got that lunatic Bolton out of there and stopped focusing on Iran, instead of actually established threats.
@krypt3ia Sadly true. Somehow, we've focused instead on Iran and North Korea, rather than existing, established threats that LITERALLY border each other and have historic hatred. Seems legit /s

@MocoMillennial @Tennesseine I think the identity politics angle is the wrong way to go. We need to focus on economic matters, like universal healthcare, fixing social security, a modern New Deal project to reconstitute our aging infrastructure. Those issues resonate with everyone I think.
@MocoMillennial @Tennesseine Totally agree
@MocoMillennial @Tennesseine Biden is from Scranton, PA. He's one of the few people who really gets the rust belt mentality and not from the lofty heights other candidates seem to have to descend from in order to pretend to get it.
@krypt3ia Fair

@MocoMillennial @Tennesseine IMHO, the only person with a real chance of beating Trump is Biden. I know, I know,  but I think if ran on a ticket with Kamala Harris or someone like that and promised to only serve one term, it's the best we can hope for.

@robinmarty AND most importantly, this is a conversation reproductive justice advocates need to be having, I know we are, individually, in certainly places, but it needs to be more widespread, perhaps more formal? IDK, but something has to be done...
@robinmarty I completely agree 100%. Sad reality is that that knowledge/access is unlikely to permeate communities who will be most in need post-Roe so I don't feel comfortable discarding such vital imagery if that makes any sense? Either way, there are MUCH better options we MUST stress.
I'm torn on this. It seems the post-Roe reality will be that those w/ access the information &amp;  can afford to pay/wait for the pills will be fine, similar to those in such circumstances were when coat hangers WERE the rallying cry.

Let's ALSO be clear that the vast majority of those who are trafficked are farm and domestic workers. Sex trafficking is a minor portion of the issue; Trump is only pretending to care about sex trafficking because it pulls at heart strings more than people slaving in fields.

@likklebrowngyal I guess for us, as "the chosen" we are so accustomed to having to suffer as a test of endurance and faith that it's become almost part of our cultural DNA. I don't know if that makes sense &amp; I'm sure others can explain it better.
@likklebrowngyal It's more that we've been the refugees, the stateless for so long, that the social justice component of my faith (Reform to be clear) means that we are obliged to stick up for those that don't have a voice, that are disenfranchised, who are being marginalised.

@AllThingsNatSec I'm torn, I agree, but I also feel like the Senators should be the one asking the questions, since they are the ones preemptively deciding that it doesn't matter what's said, they already don't believe Dr. Ford (ahem, Lindsey Graham).

@ezlusztig Trust me, I get it. It's night and day, but Beach Week is rather the great equalizer ;-)
@ezlusztig I went with people from both public and prep schools. I attended both myself. Trust me, the only difference was how much you had to pay for the drugs - my ex was dealing cocaine out of our living room apt on the Boardwalk. Trust me, I know what it meant.
@coastalelite22 @ezlusztig Yep! Our parents were the ones buying the booze, signing the leases, etc. This was just what seniors did after the week after graduation. #BeachWeek
@ezlusztig That's SOP for high schoolers here. I know someone who was arrested the first day of Beach Week - not only did their parents bail them out, they let them stay for the rest of the week!
@ezlusztig Almost every single high school in Maryland had students who went/go to Beach Week. It's  not a secret, though scandalous things are par for the course. And the legends from one year become tales for the next class to top.
