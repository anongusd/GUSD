@mtracey @c_cgottlieb Michael Cohen lied. Wow! So does every human on the planet.  Difference is that he is now coming clean.  No longer directed and paid for by the Liar in Chief.  IQ45’s demise has been gaslighted by his own doing when he became President!  Can’t be a crook AND be President!
@riley_momma @c_cgottlieb Traitor and bigot for calling out the truth? No sir!  Calling out the truth does not make someone a bigot!  We will see as Trump and friends all come toppling down from their golden showers...oh I mean towers....his becoming President has gaslighted his own demise!
@thebradfordfile @c_cgottlieb Investigations take time especially when you have liars in chief and their associates slowly confessing their sins.  Don’t worry!  Trump and fam will topple with the 1000 lawsuits he has going on right now!
@Pete4709 @CumbeeJames @NikkiHaley What was a gross abuse of power during Obama’s presidency?  The bipartisanship that he tried to practice that McConnell so proudly declared victory against allowing him that?  That’s what watching Foxaganda or YouTube gets u for your news

@JonaldTrumper @NikkiHaley Sad to hear that you have volunteered that many hours into something you don’t believe in! Forcing votes by threat is not NOT asking for something in return.

@Cats007 @NikkiHaley America will never be Russia!  Sorry buddy!
@meredith0829 @NikkiHaley Exactly!  She wants to buy votes!  The GOP wants to force votes.  It’s called totalitarianism!  I literally cannot believe she said this, believes this, and worse people on here (probably religious folks), who think this is brilliant! Reflects IQ45’s 35-40% base mentality!
@WadeChristense5 @NikkiHaley Move to Russia where they practice Totalitarianism there
@jonTcrosby @mjohn55 @NikkiHaley It seems like Totalitarianism!  Forcing a poorer country to vote like our wealthy country because it benefits us, and because you give aid is not “NOT asking for nothing in return”!  It’s Putins way and if the GOP loves Totalitarianism, then move to Russia!
@Gary_Hargreaves @NikkiHaley @GOP @GOPChairwoman Sounds like he’s in it for totalitarianism!

@kayleighmcenany @realDonaldTrump @POTUS You do remember what was handed of to Obama by Bush right?  The mortgage crisis, which was not manufactured by Obama!  So again let’s CLARIFY the facts.  Obama got a shitty hand and turned the economy around and that is what he handed off to Trump!  Your Chump is a traitor!
Hmmm yes he Clairified that he was talking about Babies that didn’t have long to live, or would suffer because of life threatening issues.  Maybe you need to look up the definition of clarify! https://t.co/G1wCGLQSMQ

@_BlairEllis @kayleighmcenany @GOP You can thank Obama for handing that trend off to your Chump!  But Kudos for now!  Too bad he couldn’t be an honest, ethical, non racist because maybe the left would lay off his back.  But you can’t change the devils horns.
@GOP @kayleighmcenany There’s a whole lotta people who want all humans to have coverage.  A whole lotta people who want pre-existing conditions covered.  A whole lotta people who don’t want insurance companies making healthcare decisions.  Which would include a whole lotta Republicans as well!

@VictoriaSeries Bertie’s apparently dyslexic.I’m assuming that long ago there was no diagnosis, but great Albert noticed he needed extra special teaching!With Prince Charles, Harry,&amp;Beatrice all being dyslexic really only confirms its in their genes.

@telly_visions @LacyMB I hope the bad parenting is considered as Victoria’s issue.  Albert clearly is recognising his son has issues, which what we all know now is dyslexia.
@LunaRosaNoir Because with his stutter that he later acquires and Prince Vharles, Harry, and Beatrice all being dyslexic, it is clealy in their genes.
@ruthlessbunny Recognised is not the same as diagnosed unfortunately.  In 2018 many teachers can’t recognise it and don’t believe it exists.

@NC_Governor Cheating in an election should be a indictable offence.  Not another chance to win in an office they broke the law to get.
@NC_Governor If a political participant in an electoral process has cheated, there should not be another election.  The party that commutes election fraud should be indicted and the party that didn’t cheat, should automatically win!

@gale5683102891 @tvcoach911 @jaredlholt If there is an investigation beginning or currently happening, then I will trust the investigation... as long as it’s legitimate.  If they are guilty, they should be charged.  Funny how your party doesn’t agree with an investigation against the Liar in Chief!
@gale5683102891 @tvcoach911 @jaredlholt For some reason...sheep...your Trump rallies....baaaa....can’t seem to let go of Hillary....baaaa...I wonder why that is....baaa. When she isn’t even in office anymore...baaaa.  Why does your party condone trumps thievery...baaaa...but not anyone else’s?

@gale5683102891 @DaltonMariellen @tvcoach911 @jaredlholt He is the corruption!Hes the swamp!U are watching the fake news that the Liar has pointed you to! U can have your opinions, but the man and his children will be wearing orange jumpers&amp;will lose all of their money like Manafort did&amp;he won’t be able to file bankruptcy the$this time
@gale5683102891 @DaltonMariellen @tvcoach911 @jaredlholt What because you lil Leader says so?
@11Warriors I don’t like the guy necessarily.  But he has dyslexia in his family, and while that is mentally challenged, it also means you are intelligent in other ways. I hate how he took the Presidency. But he gets points for not being a dick like Chump and His mafioso!
@James_A_Newland @MiloseG I’m not sure of anything!  I’m basing it off of not seeing any documents aired on Rachel Maddie that suggest Pence has not been named to my knowledge.  But I’m a bystander and so is she..maybe we will be pleasantly surprised and he will have files charged against him too

Something that the Liar in Chief spews to protect his illegal activity?  Yeah... I’m the one conning you! You are very representative of your Republican Party. Fake unsupported news
@gale5683102891 @DaltonMariellen @tvcoach911 @jaredlholt What you are baa’ing &amp;repeating Chumps claims of CNN being fake news? IQ45 is your messiah &amp;so when the Liar states something, then your research deems MSM as fake news.

@gale5683102891 @DaltonMariellen @tvcoach911 @jaredlholt You apparently didn’t look at any of the articles I shared with you!  And so your party has become the party that condones illegal activity, lying, and the mafioso Chump and friends in office!

Is it too soon to say that we only have two more years until the nex election, and we need to keep registering voters for the next two years.  That giving up now, may allow Trump and the corrupt and complicit GOP to continue in office.  Now is not the time to relax!

@ann_neona @DaddyDaddymac @JamesCeragioli 👍that’s what I was thinking
@XombieStomp I’m maintaining my anger over the lies.  The moment we normalise and accept the lying is the moment our country is lost forever! We must demand and expect more.  Never stop fighting for the truth!  Maybe I’ve watched too many Superman movies!
@XombieStomp I don’t think It’s accurate to say everyone lies.  That they are ALL corrupt.  I think the majority is, and we just need to get more honest people with integrity to run.  I suggested my relative to run, and she won’t think of it unfortunately!
@XombieStomp Nothing rides. Just the truth.  I have a non blood relative that is also the same.  She is German/?? (Can’t remember where), but lived in Germany with relatives for lengthy visits where they also are very frank.  She and I are a lot alike.  We detest dishonesty. So I don’t think
@XombieStomp I m interested.  I just don’t agree full heartedly!  Most humans lies. It’s human nature.  When I was younger as we all do, lied.  But as an adult, I learned to despise it.  I am frank and honest with everyone to a point where people look at me like how dare I, even though I say
@XombieStomp My assumption was to figure out their game plan on how they were going to flip the story. I am contemplating switching Shepherd back on for some Fox objectivity.  I heard he was outright challenging trump on some lies he had stated, so I may try him out for some balance
@XombieStomp Of person.  I used to watch Fox.  I did.  I mostly permanently turned it off when I switched the moment Trumps audio of his Pousse grabbing moment.  I immediately turned to fox to see what they were reporting...they had a Michael Jackson, Diana Ross, whitney Houston special on.
@XombieStomp Is why you should be able to speak your truth.  But then there is security issues preventing that as well.  I won’t turn off trusted shows I watch.  My favorite is Rachel Maddow.  She always shows actual court documents to support what she says.  I’m a proof and facts matter kind
@XombieStomp Conspiracies are built on. Yet communities and people everywhere fuel the gossip and conspiracies without doing any due diligence or fact searching.  But it’s also unrealistic to think that everyone could go to the war torn places you have been to see what really happened.  Which
@XombieStomp Anywhere is life we need to not trust everything.  Always keep one eye open and trust our intuition. But it seems conspiracy theories are running amuck and it’s only furthering the divide.  I get some conspiracies end up being true.  Hell gossip in America is the foundation
@XombieStomp Not enough people like that in the world.  Well maybe it depends.  9/11 shows some pretty amazing heroes likes that
@XombieStomp And some people have too much pride.. but in a time of need, most people will take help.  Especially when it’s about community working together
@XombieStomp Yeah I don’t want to mound anyone to my image.  I love being different.  I hate sheep! Offer something new, something fresh!  I love out of the box thinkers. Don’t like stepford wife kind of community... where I unfortunately live...

@XombieStomp This week.  I’m busy for the next 3 weeks or so.  Best place to start is SICKO.  That’s where I got my first view.  And all of the extras are like documentaries themselves.  Their long and fascinating!  I prefer visual documentaries anyway.
@XombieStomp This and I know it sounds like a fake utopian society.  But they ARE real and they DO exist.  Just research it.  Don’t research it through Breibart or sources like that tho.  I’ll try to find some of the old articles I read in depth about and send your way.  Won’t be today tho or
@XombieStomp From the same place.  All of our pockets.  And NO one is left behind. No one is looked down upon because they are homeless and not contributing because the govt gets them up and contributing.  Crime is down because it’s a equal social system that everyone is contributing!  I say
@XombieStomp You have security.  Peace of mind.  That education for u and your children, preschool, elder care, health care are all protected. Less stress.  No decisions between cancer meds or food.  No decisions between job and recovering from life threatening accident.  The money is coming
@XombieStomp Things.The way I view it, is whether it comes out of my cash pile because there is no govt, or out of the taxes I pay, it’s still all coming out of my wallet. One is just labeled as taxes and the other is not.But the taxes socialised version where corporations pay a large part of
@XombieStomp To pay for someone to come in and help her or you send her off to a facility... point is from being til life, we cannot predict everything we will endure, but most of it we can. So on your expenses side of the balance sheet, you are paying out all of this cash for all of these
@XombieStomp ...preschool for your little ones, public school as they grow up, you lose your job because your coal mining job coal is officially dead, so you pay for retraining or more education, your one remaining parent gets Alzheimer’s and you and your wife can’t quit your jobs, so u have
@XombieStomp I look at it like a Balance sheet that I have done informally since I was in fourth grade.  I have one side with my income.  Say we pay NO taxes, so all of your income is for you to spend. The other side is your outgoing costs.  Food, gas, going out, housing, college, health care
@XombieStomp There would have to be a lot of education and acceptance first.  If All of society doesn’t see the benefit, then I can’t see the success of socialism anywhere.  But one cannot discount the countries that love and respect their social construct.
@XombieStomp Maybe because I sent it during the time he had bomb and other threats to him and a divorce.I may give him another chance.  I’m still not a major fan tho. It would have to a majority vote for it to be successful! &amp;it couldn’t have interference by anyone who believes in capitalism
@XombieStomp Yeah I seriously don’t believe the US will do it!  Unless they start educating people from the actual successful countries.  I wrote to Michael Moore years ago and asked why don’t they air Sicko on TV so the people can judge for themselves.  No response.  But I learned yeaterday
@XombieStomp It has been accomplished!  Best area to look at is he Scandinavian countries.  It’s successful around the world.  But not if you listen to Republican sources because then they would be betraying their shareholders.  Seriously go buy SICKO or borrow it from the library
@XombieStomp Serious questions.  No judgement ;)
@XombieStomp So they split them up.  And who takes them cannot afford enough food or healthcare, but they couldn’t leave them stranded life deals shitty blows to people all the time.  Do we just discard those that can’t help themselves.  Leave them on the streets?
@XombieStomp No friends that are good enough to do what needs to be done, what do we do with you?  OR if you have a family of 5, you get in a car accident, you and your wife die. And ur 3 young children remain.  Maybe someone steps forward to help take the children but they cannot afford all
@XombieStomp Yeah I hear that from the right!  I just think in reality if we had no govt involvement, then life would be worse for the majority.  For example, we cannot predict life. Say you got in a major car accident and couldn’t work for years or for the rest of your life. U have no family
@XombieStomp Naahhhh don’t give up yet!  I think a politician with money is for sure going to be liars and power hungry!  But there are some people out there trying to change that!  What do u think of Beto O’Rourke in Texas?
@XombieStomp Yes it’s unfortunate!  I’ve heard it compared to the mafia. Which is what I compare Trump and friends to.  Definitely need start all over everywhere. I am hopeful with some of the people running now all around the country.  But I don’t trust that the polling stations are accurate

@XombieStomp I’m glad we could have some dialogue!  Most Americans want the same thing!  But we have to agree to talk calmly and be open to not assuming we know who the other side is!  Thank you for opening up and taking the time!
@XombieStomp I will always hold hope for socialism, but am a realist and don’t expect it to ever change.  I just can’t give into the idea that lying is acceptable
@XombieStomp Being wealthy isn’t a bad thing and socialism doesn’t get rid of different classes. You still have people that decide to be drs and People that decide to be blue collar workers. But giving everyone an education equally also changes the prospects of someone’s future and their hope
@XombieStomp Yeah I don’t have the answers for it all!  I’m sure their are answers, but we can’t even get the politicians to agree on what’s fact or fiction
@XombieStomp Starting at square one, would not be easy.  And I remember maybe 20 years ago, politicians on both sides when Bush 2 was President I think, about doing a similar program.  I think it was semi successful until we didn’t address the issues of childcare for single mothers.
@XombieStomp I would be hopeless too if I were in that situation. The documentary I suggested talks about that.  And in their country, they would all be trained and/or educated and out into the workforce. If one job didn’t work out, then they would retrain in another line of work.  I’m sure
@XombieStomp Has the connection to the governor that is in prison.  But not sure if it’s a true connection or if it’s just another wealthy individual trying to buy his way into politics.
@XombieStomp Yes I read a Republican published article stating that Rauner is the worst governor in the country.  And a Chicagoan was arguing that I was just a liberal stating that, but showed him the link and he no longer replied.  I hear the new options aren’t great on either side.  The Dem
@XombieStomp That would be interesting!  I didn’t realize there were some towns that have eliminated their police
@XombieStomp So that I guess that is where we differ.  I would bug you even if you weren’t on my property or interfering with my property.  I feel like it’s my human duty, and civic duty to help anyone and everyone.  That might not be healthy, but I really was born this way
@XombieStomp To be wrong!  I love it when I’m wrong and someone takes the time to point it out.  I would hate to be running around saying a horse has 8 legs and no one say anything.  I would feel stupid and wonder why no one pointed out the truth or facts to me.Yet society typically does that
@XombieStomp Don’t care or read.  I’m not saying I’m better, but what good is arguing about lying if we don’t have rational dialogue. If I want to help ALL Americans which I think we all want, why r we tearing each other down instead of showing some respect.  We can’t all be right.  It’s ok
@XombieStomp Your right!  Seriously, I have gone low a few times.  I’m only human..but for the most part I’m shocked that it’s like watching pit bulls fighting back and forth and for the most part neither side is using Facts.  They just name call and some cartoons and when I post facts, they
@XombieStomp Yes!! I agree completely!!
@XombieStomp I think I believe in that as well, but the stronger force in me is to help anyone that needs help! I would be the first to run in the street if someone, anyone got hit or shot or hurt.I would hesitate to stand up for someone because I know not everyone can stand up for themselves
@XombieStomp Do you think the comments of Trump about not trusting the media is not hurting anyone?  (Im not arguing...just asking to understand). Do u think his lies affect anything?
@XombieStomp better than lesser lies.  Or  maybe not lesser but fewer.  I’m confused and this is what makes me angry!  I value honesty and integrity and morality more than anything.  And I just can’t comprehend it.?!?
@XombieStomp To millions.  And I wonder how can anyone support a liar?  The only reason to lie is to confuse the people you are lying to and to protect the liars only interests.  And so I wonder if the right is wanting to make America great again, how is accepting the 5000+ lies better than
@XombieStomp There are many things I never finished.  So yes.  They blindly choose a side vs trying to be objective.  But today, what my focus on is the lying.  I have u my history and gift of seeing BS.  I grew up with it.  I learned to recognize it.  And with Trump it’s obvious and apparent
@XombieStomp And lastly, it’s a failed experiment here in the US.  But not elsewhere where other countries want to take care of their fellow countrymen and Capitalism isn’t controlling the decisions and politics of the country.
@XombieStomp They needed.  It’s just one view.  You don’t have to agree with it, but I would be interested in hearing what u thought afterwards.
@XombieStomp And the extras are long but a fascinating view of various countries and their views on America and their views of socialism in their country.  It touches on Big pharma in the US and outside of the Us.  It shows 9/11 workers and volunteers who have died not getting the healthcare
@XombieStomp Really fascinating!But let me ask you to do one thing at least.  Doesn’t have to be today or next week, but sometime, order Sicko. It is Michael Moore which I am not a Michael Moore fan which is why it took us a long time to watch it after years of owning it.But it is eye opening
@XombieStomp Implement it in the right way, but  I know there is information out there explaining the evolution of socialism in Scandinavia and the ups and downs they have had and how they have figured out how to keep it balanced and self corrected themselves over the years.  It’s actually
@XombieStomp old white men that I truly believe are racist and would not allow a black man to succeed in office.  I truly believe that.  Back then I watched both Fox and Liberal while I tried to figure out what I truly was.  I think Bernie would like to be socialist, but wouldn’t know how to
@XombieStomp Venezuela.  But Venezuela is NOT a true socialist country.  A socialist country cannot have a dictator running the country.  Do I think the top leaders understand socialism completely.  I think Obama probably was the closest, but he tried too hard to maintain bi partisanship with
@XombieStomp The public doesn’t truly understand how successful it could be, because it is significantly paid for by business taxes.  And republicans like to cut business taxes.  It’s the largest conspiracy the GOP has to maintain. I constantly hear that how horrible the left wants to be like
@XombieStomp Money talks.  And the top 1% and lobbyists pay millions to get their needs met, which is to ensure their shareholders monetary interests are met. I do believe in socialism completely.  It’s successful around the world in multiple countries. But the far right will make sure that
@XombieStomp Oh I don’t believe the US will ever truly be a socialist country.  Because we have a 2(3) party system, we will never have a properly functioning socialised system.  We will always have partisan interference and failure in that dept.  My belief is specifically based on Capitalism
@XombieStomp He was robbed!  That’s funny!  I didn’t expect that response from you!
@XombieStomp Then also if someone has some political tie or reason to not be honest, what their personal focus is on in the incident, all affect what they will observe, and report.
@XombieStomp Heard the studies about how 50 people in a room could all witness the same incident, but they would all have diff versions of what they saw.  Because of neurological differences, how their fear, anxiety affects them, their personalities, Their gift or lack of gift of observation,
@XombieStomp I have a knack for seeing through BS too. I’ve learned in the past few years about how everyone is born with neurological differences, gifts..(again slow learner in life in understanding that we are all different in abilities;) but it’s a gift of mine also.  But I’m sure you have
@XombieStomp Their facts and then he and then finally the Saudis admitted they planned on killing the journalist?  Or do u mean how there are coverups... like if Turkey didn’t have the proof they had, we wouldn’t really know the truth and it would have been spun?
@XombieStomp Do u mean how they try to guess what may have happened and then the story evolves and then they finally come to a conclusion? Or like the story recently with Trump saying he believed the Saudi Prince as they offered multiple different versions..until Turkey Kemp pushing back with
@XombieStomp Not sure I understand the end of this response...
@XombieStomp Advantage of social systems.  But implementaing a true socialized system that allows everyone to be educated and trained and access to a better life to provide for themselves which in turn produces less crime and lower health issues.
@XombieStomp Taking away Americans 2nd amendment (well I do think we should get rid of all guns), but would never think to take that away from your constitutional rights.  I just believe in better regulation and no semi automatic(?)..I don’t believe in letting people just be lazy and take
@XombieStomp So I’m a liberal and have never used services, but my brother a far right Rep, has used many and multiple social services for years.  So party and beliefs can not define our circumstances or our needs.  I don’t believe in open borders, but legal immigration.  I don’t believe in
@XombieStomp ...My life. I now began to understood what was deep in my heart.  How I viewed the world.  How capitalism controls our politics.  Over the next many years, I’ve just kept up with the demands of life with kids with disabilities, but we have never used any social services. So I’m a
@XombieStomp Across the aisle.  This was my first thought of whether I was truly Republican.  I watch the Documentary Sicko maybe 3 years after that and I became an Independent.  I am now an Independent voting straight Blue.  Watching that movie changed my life.  It opened my eyes and changed
@XombieStomp So after watching Fox News religiously, I watched Republicans tear it apart and telling Obama they wouldn’t pass it as it was.  I also had a daughter born with birth defects.  I was interested in this issue.  I watched Obama try to bipartisan and I watched the Reps refuse to work
@XombieStomp Owns his own business. He had collected unemployment.  None of these are bad things in my book. But he doesn’t believe in socialism. But he definitely takes advantage of them. I used to be a Republican or so I was led to believe!  I shouldn’t have passed govt in high school. So
@XombieStomp My brother is a tea party maybe federalist.  He’s cheated on his wife.  His daughter has been on disability since she was born with birth defects.  She’s 23 and probably still collecting.  My brother has collected disability for himself.  He hasn’t paid his taxes fully, he owns
@XombieStomp if I was so honest, that everyone also respects honesty.  Which is funny because my father was the most unscrupulous dishonest religious con man..which is why I probably have such strong feeling towards Trump. I couldn’t stand talking to my father because I knew he was lying.
@XombieStomp Feel like I can offer.  I am naturally born a socialist.  Even though I couldn’t label it or understand it or exposed to it, I have always thought all people are created equal in every way.  I always thought if I could bend my fingers backwards, that everyone could do that. If I
@XombieStomp Process some of it and save for tomorrow.  But for now, these are my thoughts.  Right or wrong. I don’t mind being wrong or discovering the error of my views.  I like getting educated, so I don’t spew anything that’s ignorant.  There is much I don’t know though.  But much that i

@XombieStomp Thanks for sharing your story!  That’s rough! I sensed a deeper story which I believe a lot of military have a much deeper sense &amp;broader knowledge that the general American public  has. I think we (some more than others)as Americans take for granted all that is happening around

So the mortgage crisis was not created by Obama, but he got it under control &amp;brought it back down &amp;handed off to Chump! Not an easy task considering the magnitude
@BootzScootz @kusmer @RepMarkMeadows Not everyone can read graphs, but this is kind of obvious ... yes trump has improved unemployment by some.  But the complaining that the right makes about Obamas economy wasn’t Obama’s fault. It was the housing/mortgage crisis that obama https://t.co/l0gKRkTgF7

@BootzScootz @kusmer @RepMarkMeadows The classic... obama wasn’t born in America!  We all remember that one!
@BootzScootz @kusmer @RepMarkMeadows For instance, his recent statement where at a rally he stated that the middle class is literally getting a bill signed this week for a 10% tax cut.

@XombieStomp Because I think we all want somewhat similar things...it’s just the lies and smears getting in the way and everyone is just blasting each other vs dissecting it and logically understanding the other side
@XombieStomp And I’m asking u this, because all I see and hear is what and the Left is crazy.  Yet everything that is said and printed about us, is smeared and doesn’t accurately reflect my(our) views.  So I’m just trying to figure out how and what u believe about me that makes me so evil
@XombieStomp So what theories have been proven from the past?  And if you start mentioning Breitbart or Q or some crazy shit, I can’t even waste my time.  And I’m sorry, because I respect your respect for the military and the police.. but it will have to end there.
@XombieStomp On the subject.  I am NO sheep!  I have never been.  People find it quite frustrating about me.  I like to decide on my own based on many many sources of info.  uS, foreign, left right.I am my own thinker and am a problem solver.  So I’m not picking up what to believe from anyone
@XombieStomp Did I call you a name?  I don’t think I did! I think I’ve been pretty civil. So that’s what I’m asking.I don’t get my talking points from anywhere.  I’m an independent and have believed in socialism since the day I watch SICKO.  That is when I have filled my brain with knowledge
@XombieStomp From having consequences?  I think we have similar beliefs, but the problem is that the lies and deceptions are making the Left and the Right enemies.  When we should not be attacking characters, but figuring out who really is lying and being misled
@XombieStomp Following the rule of law...otherwise what is the military and police officers even fighting and making arrests for?  Sacrificing their lives, their families and children’s stability if Truth, honor, and justice don’t really matter and policiticans can come in and save each other
@XombieStomp Garland.  Obama’s bipartisanship.  Trumps lying.  Trumps covering up and not wanting to face due process.  Like seriously! I don’t think it’s fair that I follow the law And pay my taxes and my brother and Trump don’t!  It’s about black and white honesty, integrity, and all of us
@XombieStomp Lying that trump does.  And Kavanaugh is the ONLY judge that said he doesn’t think a president should face charges while president!  Thatnis a BIG deal.  And if you don’t agree with that, then I’m sorry.  It’s nothing more than the left seeing the right take advantage of Merrick
@XombieStomp I can tell you the actual reason that people want Kavanaugh out...aside from having sexual assault ACCUSATIONS and the fact that he’s lied in previous and all hearings, but just as importantly is because he was selected ONLY because of Trumps illegal activities and the obvious &amp;
@XombieStomp That cycle.  What is the real chance that the hood will ever be less dangerous or less crime affecting our communities without us making sure we all pitch in together and all treat each other like Americans working together to make America better for all?
@XombieStomp Socialism isn’t meant to make lazy people more lazy.  But to get all people to contribute and for all people to have an equal shot at prosperity. If u r broke and poor and live in the hood without a good education, what are the REAL chance and likelihood that they will get out of
@XombieStomp Millionaires &amp; billionaires want to continue to make money off of the working class’s back.  Now if u r in the top 1%, then tell me now, and I’ll shut up, because u know all this then.  You would know that this is all about Capitalism making the wealthier wealthier.
@XombieStomp Hate it because Republicans care about shareholders and the top 1% making money.  Why would Trump say Sweden has a top healthcare system, when it’s socialized medicine?  He didn’t know?!!  But it’s true.  There is so much misinformation out there to scare the public away because
@XombieStomp Decisions and are profiting off of it!  You see a truly socialized system, there isn’t a dictator such as Venezuela.  And there isn’t profit to be made for shareholders.  Socialized health care isn’t what we have.  We have a System that was meant to fail and meant for people to
@XombieStomp It.  Obama trying to be bi-partisan even though he held all the power as republicans do now, wanted to make both sides happy. So republicans went in and hacked it and then passed it!  It’s not a true socialized health care system!  Why?  Because insurance companies still make the
@XombieStomp Paying for anyone else.  And I know many on ur side well Obamacare sucks and is too expensive.Well first of all Obamacare wasn’t passed just by obama.  I was a republican then &amp; watched fox and remember specifically how republicans said they will not let it pass until they change
@XombieStomp And covered when we we need it.  But none of its free.  And none of it costs more than we already pay out of pocket or save for etc.  Generally.  And I get where ur party sits on the issue.  U don’t want to pay for anyone else. But if everyone had education and training, your not
@XombieStomp And we all get out!  It’s not getting anything for free.  It’s like a big savings bucket.  We all would pay for education medical etc anyway, yet this is in a bigger pot that everyone contributes and takes from.  We are all educated, all covered under health care, all helped when
@XombieStomp Right is not everyone getting everything for free. It’s really similar to what we have now in the US except for everyone is trained and educated to become tax paying contributing citizens.  One of the main differences is that businesses contribute more, we all pay into the system
@XombieStomp The same or similar?!  But point being, HE has taken disability for himself, his daughter, unemployment, hasn’t paid what he should pay in taxes..  to me he is a hypocrit!  But a far right fighter.  So a person cannot be defined by what side they are  on.  And socialism done
@XombieStomp No one is asking for govt to provide it in that sense.  Real Socialism doesn’t work that way.    It’s not about giving and taking away for free. And I have never taken any govt help. My brother on the other hand who is probably a federalist, definitely tea party which I think are

@realDonaldTrump The Republicans are in complete control asssshole!Yet you keep blaming Dems!Why do you keep lying?More importantly, why do your Religious Right keep voting for a Liar in Chief?I wonder if that will get them through those Pearly Gates knowing THEYare putting an evil liar in office

@LGund71 @DaddyDaddymac Did you know 100 million people did not vote in 2016.  You know how many people have died for women and people of color to have the right to vote? We have to all get off our asses and educate others on why the GOP is going to take us back 100+ years in time. They are unscrupulous

@DaddyDaddymac @TinWain But Black people everywhere NEVER call the cops????
@DaddyDaddymac @TinWain I don’t agree with any of this.  I hate racism!  But not EVERYWHERE can you say they would probably get shot!  I get the odds of it are extremely higher, but black people calling the cops can’t be a death sentence everywhere and every time?  I get that it’s a scary proposition.

@GrammaGaz @DaddyDaddymac He was pretty large and muscular.  That would work against him with the police I’m sure... and even in my eyes.  I think ultimately he has to be the bigger person and just yell back and scare the shit@out of her but not touch her

Which is why I attached her name to some links.  It’s very suspect.  That u r Uber nice on that one thread, but

Maybe.. but then I just see after that discussion u saying to Annie how u have tried to fix thing because she knows how u r, but u were

Just own it take responsibility. And move forward. But instead u start

@AnnieAdeleI @Enterprise1054 @XombieStomp @diana_gaudenti @dennis0805a @realDonaldTrump Transparency sakes.  Not to change a thinking woke Liberal from a thinking woke Liberal.  Transparency is honesty to me.  And when I’m being blamed of behavior that I haven’t done, then transparency is necessary.
@AnnieAdeleI @Enterprise1054 @XombieStomp @diana_gaudenti @dennis0805a @realDonaldTrump And am I a bigot nobody trying to change Annie’s mind?  I’m not trying to change Annie’s mind if anything’s. I just shared a new thread Patton started on a different convo of mine that was opposite of what he was saying to https://t.co/xJaM7FFaPV I looped her in on the thread for
@AnnieAdeleI @Enterprise1054 @XombieStomp @diana_gaudenti @dennis0805a @realDonaldTrump What I don’t get is that of the Resistance is a racist?  So if I r blue or left or a liberal, they are a racist?  But u seem definitely blue/left
@AnnieAdeleI @Enterprise1054 @XombieStomp @diana_gaudenti @dennis0805a @realDonaldTrump Sorry I don’t understand this last comment.  Maybe I walked away for too long.  Just don’t understand anything past not being able to read the WAPO.

@Enterprise1054 @XombieStomp @diana_gaudenti @dennis0805a @realDonaldTrump ... who vote for them...  I pay my taxes.  I follow laws.  I expect my politicians to try to meet in the middle and represent all of us and not play these baby games that the GOP is currently playing.  If that is an agenda, the. I have an agenda.  To end the lies and deceipt
@Enterprise1054 @XombieStomp @diana_gaudenti @dennis0805a @realDonaldTrump I don’t have a problem with Republicans, but when your leaders are lying left and right and protecting each other because you are doing unscrupulous actions, then the party needs to fire everyone and get back in politicians that will work for ALL Americans, not just 45% who vote
@Enterprise1054 @XombieStomp @diana_gaudenti @dennis0805a @realDonaldTrump Trump in office, I will vote straight blue until bi-partisanship enters the political arena again.When Merrick Garland was denied even being met with by the GOP because the GOP didn’t want Obama to have his Presidential right to nominate a SupremeCourt justice, my gloves came off
@Enterprise1054 @XombieStomp @diana_gaudenti @dennis0805a @realDonaldTrump Or Is Trump racist!  I have sent a bunch or articles and links.  I had hoped you would have read them. I have no agenda Patton.  I used to be Republican.  I then became an independent.  I’m still independent because I believe truth depends on the person, not the party.  But with
@Enterprise1054 @XombieStomp @diana_gaudenti @dennis0805a @realDonaldTrump There is no threat!  They are facts!  All you need to do is watch something other than Fox News and you will see news video of Trumps racism.  Now I know Annie mentioned how Chump even shared how he claimed his Nationalist status!  Google trumps History with the KKK or is trump

I did tell Annie to rise up and go High and don’t go low!  To just provide the facts.  I’ve done nothing but that but get ignored by them and called names and innuendos by the others.

@Enterprise1054 @XombieStomp @diana_gaudenti @dennis0805a @realDonaldTrump Threaten is a strong word.  You should know that!  I haven’t threatened anyone except with supplying Facts and Truth!  If you see that as threatening, that explains it all doesn’t it?
@Enterprise1054 @XombieStomp @diana_gaudenti @dennis0805a @realDonaldTrump Are being lied too.They like being lied to.They like sticking to what they know because it makes them uncomfortable otherwise!I personally HATE lying!So if that makes Uthink that I hATE the GOP, a better guess would be that I HATE liars!Lying is meant to mislead &amp;protect the liar
@Enterprise1054 @XombieStomp @diana_gaudenti @dennis0805a @realDonaldTrump My name is the GOP is the KKK.  Any pics I’ve posted are articles with pics attached to the article!  The article explaining how the GOP and Chump are connected to the KKK.  You would know that if you read any of them.  But like@I said to Vee, not everyone cares to know if they
@Enterprise1054 @XombieStomp @diana_gaudenti @dennis0805a @realDonaldTrump If I had hate for GOP people, why would I waste my time in trying to help Republicans have Facts that they may not otherwise be e posed to?  It’s a funny way of thinking?  To withhold knowledge from someone is showing hate?  That’s warped and I don’t operate that way! My name..
@Enterprise1054 @brianstelter I do!  Gotta make sure those that watch Fox, are exposed and educated!  I don’t mind!  I see it as a good deed!

@JeffFlake @lisamurkowski @SenatorCollins it’s not about Having a conservative justice on SCOTUS. It’s going to happen no matter what..it’s about whether Kavanaugh is qualified.  Whether heHAS lied, his temperament, his honesty..nominate another conservative thats more qualified
@JeffFlake @lisamurkowski @SenatorCollins what are you going to do about the lying and manipulations of the GOP leaders?They have manipulated the American people with lies and deceptions. And Uhave the power and opportunity to stand up for millions of us and say NO MORE tomorrow

@JeffFlake @lisamurkowski @SenatorCollins now is your chance to do what is right!Not for votes or for re-election.But based on who and how Kavanaugh performed as a nominee for the highest court in the land. If U vote him through, ur integrity &amp;your ethics are showing on ur sleeve

@SenJohnThune @senjudiciary Does a man of character &amp;integrity that is supposedly a judge, lie &amp;disregard answering questions in a hearing amongst Senators? Does he utter the words,“what goes around, comes around?”What is your definition of integrity as he does not act like a judge in even the lowest courts
How could the FBI investigation be considered thorough when they didn’t even question the accuser and the so called Judge.  How could it be thorough when 40 witnesses that had information were denied the opportunity to speak to investigators!  U lie to the American people https://t.co/ONC3yJNT0W
@senorrinhatch @senjudiciary It was The GOP that choked the FBI investigation. It’s the GOP that didn’t ask any questions of Kavanaugh in the hearing &amp; limited questioning by Dems to 5 mins.
