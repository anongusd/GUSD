@RealJamesWoods Did you ever, in your life, think that Sean Young would pity YOUR career prospects?
@RealJamesWoods With all the scripts being sent your way, how do you find so much time to spend on twitter?  #JamesWoodsTheWorkaholic
@realDonaldTrump Clapper also said that Qaddafi would prevail in Libya.
@RealJamesWoods Maybe he can get you back to work. "Olympus Has Fallen Again" maybe?
@Leafer1 @politico C'mon, he was a baby once. A baby with a combover.
@Bronco_7777 @DrCraigMalkin Don't call @realDonaldTrump a psycho without being able to back it up with evidence.
@FrankLuntz Is that guy who yelled, "You Lie!" still in office? Just wondering..
@fox32news the drug that killed the parents(and thousands of others) is Schedule 2; Marijuana? :schedule 1. God Bless unfettered capitalism.
@AnnCoulter Wait, is CPAC still going on?
@realDonaldTrump @FoxNews 	WHEW! 	Some of us were worried it might reference some "PRESIDENTIAL DAILY BRIEFING FROM @DHSgov". 	THAT'D SUCK!
@realDonaldTrump How can you appoint a BALD man?	If he was a WINNER, he'd have a shitty scalp surgery!  	Then he would rape his wife!	WEAK!
@realDonaldTrump @FoxNews Thanks for clarifying that!  Hope next time you provoke a threat to the US, you'll have as much time to clarify...
@realDonaldTrump Who told you to do that, pray tell?  Is he one of the generals who knows less about ISIS than you?
@realDonaldTrump I thought "MAGA" made no sense in light of American progress. Now, I see it's the perfect slogan for 2020. Thanks, Donnie.
@mskristinawong @AnnCoulter "Girl?" ...Don't be presumptuous...
@AnnCoulter .. it's amazing; the right wing crazy gets elected and suddenly YOUR crazy ain't enough anymore...
@SenTedCruz now that you support Trump, do concede that your wife is ugly and your father was involved in JFK's assassination?  Spineless.
@mrnickharvey  gotta love tweets from the future
@Khanoisseur Putin doesn't need blackmail. He's only gotta act as a kleptocrat coach, promising to make Trump as rich as he pretends to be.
@realDonaldTrump How many 9/11 terrorists were from Iran? And how well is Trump Tower Saudi Arabia doing? Egypt?
@ditzkoff Terrible example! Fake news! Patrick Henry was low energy! ...I prefer patriots of the revolutionary war who WEREN'T captured!
@IntuitiveAlts @ditzkoff "certifiable," maybe
Ahhh, let the guy be.  He IS pretty, after all... He could be worse...		#AtLeatHesNotTebow https://t.co/snrvXSdSfA
@kmshaikh @imraansiddiqi It's not getting coverage b/c the MSM afraid to tell the truth ab Trump's America.`	Wouldve won
@microsleeper @AnnCoulter CAPS LOCK MAKES IT TRUE!
@AnnCoulter COULTER NEEDS TO HOLD HER BALLS BEHIND HER LEGS WITH A STRIP OF DUCT TAPE!
@AnnCoulter Yeah, let's let moderate Muslims in-- like the Saudis doing business with Donnie Big-Hands (not as big as yours, of course).
@AnnCoulter They say you have a poorly shaved Adam's apple and hands like a NY Knick... Maybe you'd get more play at Trump Saudi Arabia...
@microsleeper @AnnCoulter @realDonaldTrump BTW: were your father's fingers bigger than your cock?
@AnnCoulter @realDonaldTrump but, the "nations" which produced the 9/11 hijackers are free to come on in? You're really a craven moron, huh?
@AnnCoulter What did your father do to you?
RT @staffernews: Well that's awkward @jonlovett @jonfavs https://t.co/8EDTh9aPjY

@RealJamesWoods Did you ever run into @chuckwoolery  at a bathhouse? What did his LoveConnection taste like?
@jack Or did Milo pose a greater threat to your audience?... / more negative  than (knee-jerk) ((blindly)) positive reactions... [you hero!]
@David_Feldman_ Milo Yianolamadingdong was banned for hate speech... How long will @jack allow @realDonaldTrump a platform for hate speech?
@jack You blocked @MiloYannallammadingdong... Why do you provide a platform for @realDonaldTrump ? Methinks you prefer traffic to ideals...
@realDonaldTrump Please keep on doing what you are doing.. it's very important to me that you do!	                   -Richard Nixon's legacy
Twitter suspended Milo's account for offensive content; How long will they continue letting @realDonaldTrump tweet? #TwitterBanPOTUS
@haaretzcom @Blue__America Maybe he would, if his parent's hadn't bought his higher education....
@realDonaldTrump ...And American diplomats, and American Christian leaders, but, screw those traitorous bastards, right?
@realDonaldTrump ...Once Vlad gives you the green light?
@realDonaldTrump I may be mentally deranged, but I support you 1 billion trillion per cent, because you think like me!
@RealJamesWoods Is it true that you can catch a 90mph fastball with your face?
What did you do to Brad Renfro, BTW? https://t.co/iOdDUwooI2
@Variety Does that make him eligible for a Trump Cabinet position?

@RealJamesWoods The Golden Globes probably wouldn't seem so elitist if you were capable of winning one...
@Franksantopadre @RealGilbert Just heard your "born in 1916" Ep, and your tribute to Kirk Douglass; no mention of the Natalie Wood story?
@EricBoehlert Somebody should do a heartrending gospel version of "Oompah loompa doopity-doo"
@MartinShkreli There are certainly some guys in the Bronx... Just go up there and freestyle; you'll be inundated with hopefuls...
@MartinShkreli What? I thought you were moving on to an art career!
@DonaldJTrumpJr I'm sorry, that wasn't fair: If you traded your wife in for someone Marla's age, she'd be much younger than your daughter..
@DonaldJTrumpJr Has your father advised you as to when you should trade your wife in for someone closer to your daughter's age?
@AC360 "New York, New York" is playing throughout Times Square... When will @RonanFarrow finally replace you?
@AC360 Congrats on being the legitimized version of Andy Cohen
@AC360 you should be careful! Some of @kathygriffin 's journalistic integrity might rub off on you.  How would you feather your firehouse?

@epngo @RepPeteKing  how much gel does that bastard use?
@IvankaTrump I'd call that a little inappropriate, but considering how your father has spoken of you, 'tis nothing. https://t.co/IdlBJTU4Mg
@realDonaldTrump Hitler, Stalin, Khrushchev, and Khomeini share that honor with you	But nobody can accuse Hitler or Stalin of draft dodging.
