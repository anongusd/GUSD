@popsknox @RedMeansGo33 @RantsByDesign @AOC @SenSanders @OurRevolution Appreciate your thoughts, @popsknox. I think a lot of the tumult is many think AOC is so incredible that it is somehow horrifying to them that anyone would have the gall to question her. I have questioned Bernie and every other elected who did or said something I wonder about.
@Dogger55 @Enjoneer01 @HillHuckle @AOC @SenSanders @OurRevolution We'll see.
@010_10_101 Fingers crossed.
@ToddBohannon @AOC @SenSanders @OurRevolution It is my responsibility and everyone's to ask questions when they have them. How does it build a stronger coalition? It does by recognizing that we hold everyone accountable from the grassroots to the halls of Congress. My motto is "speak the truth even if your voice shakes,"
@scooter2_0 @johncusack @AOC @SenSanders @OurRevolution I am not assuming anything. She could have said she still felt the bern. The door was opened for her and she chose not to walk through. I am asking questions, I always do and always will.

@Enjoneer01 @HillHuckle @AOC @SenSanders @OurRevolution I hear you, friend. However, AOC has made it very clear that she gives zero Fs about what others in Congress think.
@RantsByDesign @AOC @SenSanders @OurRevolution AOC knows exactly where she is and she knows what she wants. She is a smart and savvy woman.
@Nitzky89 @AOC @SenSanders @OurRevolution She would be very smart to let it be known publicly that she wants @SenSanders to run and that she will do everything she can to pull NY for him. That's exactly what @AOC should be doing.

@RantsByDesign @AOC @SenSanders @OurRevolution OMG! Do you really think that was the only pair of shoes AOC had?

@Enjoneer01 @HillHuckle @AOC @SenSanders @OurRevolution Bernie said very clearly that if he thinks he can win, he will run. There is not anything cagey about that. It is up to every single one of us to let him know where we stand.
