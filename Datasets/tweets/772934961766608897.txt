@pbonn1989 @CDCgov #Truth!		Victims become stats—except those with significant economic value.		When planes crash due to errors, lawsuits are filed, families of victims’ compensated and changes made so it won’t happen again.		Imagine the outrage if only those with first class tickets got justice!

@pbonn1989 @CDCgov Yes, Paul, that is a purposefully little known fact.		e.g. Joan Rivers’ cause of death is cited as “cerebral hypoxia” rather than adding “resulting from medical error.”		That’s why we really don’t know how many victims there are!		Here’s another “secret”:		https://t.co/ic46VFReIv

@on_azimuth @ehazzard @POTUS @realDonaldTrump THANK YOU!!!!		Yes, we need to raise awareness so our “representatives” fight for us and not special interests!
@State0fTheUniom @POTUS @realDonaldTrump @GOP Yes, it’s a big problem.		If you get in a car accident, the insurance co’s battle it out.		So if doctors have malpractice insurance, why don’t patients?		Don’t want to sue the shirts off their backs - just don’t want to be saddled with the medical bills from THEIR error!!
@Observer2541 @RyanAFournier @POTUS @realDonaldTrump Thank you!		Just so you know, President Trump is setting records in speeding up the drug approval process. The chemo I’m on now wasn’t approved 5 years ago.		So I quite literally owe him my life!
