@GregHale1 @dougblandry Some sort of garage-style pull-up windowfront https://t.co/igFfcOIZdb
Warren says her decision to run came as an extension of her upbringing in Oklahoma which led to her career as a bankruptcy expert which led to Harvard, to the Senate, to.. here. "I didn't pick this because I poll-tested. I picked this because it picked me."
@GregHale1 @dougblandry Greg were you talking about crowdsize? confused. pls advise.
Warren is asked (by a former student and a supporter of her campaign) how she thinks she'll be able to win in red-leaning states with a pro-choice message when pro-life voters might "shut the door on your campaign." 		Warren: "I think the role of government here is to back out."
RT @daveweigel: Warren gets a kind of roundabout health care Q, uses it to talk about how she wants to crack down on insurance companies. D‚Ä¶
Warren's first Q from the audience, from a young woman: What does the Democratic party need and stand for? 		"I gotta tell ya, I‚Äôm not a career politician. All I know is what pulls me into the fight," EW says. Comes around to this answer: "a government that works for all of us."
I remember Hillary Clinton's first event in Iowa, where reporters kept asking her why she was running. She kept repeating the line, 'Americans need a champion' (her early slogan of sorts). Warren lays out her own answer here: https://t.co/CaC2lO5NrU
in a nutshell: Every major issue, Warren says, from gun control to health care -- "they all intersect in a Washington that is working for the wealthy and not for you."
Warren's first speech outlines a fight to end lobbying "as we know it," drive money out of politics, and fundamentally change the economy ("and when I talk about change I mean structural)" to empower workers and unions.
@GregHale1 I'm not actually sure what she was standing on. Will check it out afterward for you and @dougblandry
"The fundamental answer is back to a lot of those decisions made in Washington about who government works for." https://t.co/9G5Ux8QrLe
Warren's mic goes out in the middle of her speech. She continues on with her speech, yelling out into the crowd.
.@ewarren, kicking off her Council Bluffs event in earnest, introduces herself to the audience with a basic bio. Tells the crowd that her career has been based on one question: "What‚Äôs happening to working families in America?"
Warren told a lot of voters, ‚Äùstay strong, ‚Äúbe strong‚Äù - and at several points exclaimed (maybe with some surprise), ‚Äúthis is fun!‚Äù
Snippets from @ewarren working the overflow crowd before her very first 2020 event in IA: Warren greeted by a little girl, whom she hoists in the air and into her arms for a pic; a woman with a ‚Äúnevertheless she persisted‚Äù tattoo. Also: fewer handshakes than lots of big hugs.

Backstage in SC:		@BernieSanders thanks a group of supporters for coming to his rally today, says it shows there are progressives in places like SC. ‚ÄúWhat you did today was really important... I want to thank you for your courage.‚Äù https://t.co/AesNJqHLzl
@erossin48 @OurRevolution Nope
@allanbrauer @OurRevolution He was referring to millennial primary voters. https://t.co/ud98lVduIj
(For anyone wondering, crowd count here in Columbia, SC, was around 900 people, per the @SenSanders camp.)
After Sanders‚Äô @OurRevolution speech, Nina Turner comes out again to remind the crowd to vote on Nov. 6, mentions all the work to be done to support cands like Ben Jealous, Stacey Abrams, and Andrew Gillum.
Sanders‚Äô @OurRevolution speech in SC: lots of talk about 2016, Trump, how the Democratic policy debate has evolved on health care, criminal justice. 		But no mention by name of James Smith, the Dem gubernatorial candidate here, or any other SC Dem candidate.
RT @carolynryan: ‚ÄúFun fact - my parents don‚Äôt actually know I started a super PAC.‚Äù LOVE this. https://t.co/tNwsE5zDO3
Sanders‚Äô speech at his @OurRevolution rally in SC ‚Äî the only event on his midterm tour not tied to a 2018 candidate ‚Äî begins as a bit of a reflection on 2016 and the legacy of his campaign. He notes that he got more votes from young people than Clinton and Trump combined.
Sanders says that the voters and elected officials who had the ‚Äúcourage‚Äù to support him in South Carolina, where he lost to Hillary Clinton by 47.5%, did so to take ‚Äúon the political establishment.‚Äù
‚ÄúHello! Great turnout. And it‚Äôs funny ‚Äî I was told there were no progressives in South Carolina. I was told no one would show up to a gathering like this,‚Äù Bernie Sanders says as the crowd starts up with ‚ÄúBernie!‚Äù chants.
@hboydbrown True that the crowd here is not nearly at capacity. Upper level empty and room here in the back. There were two overflows in Michigan last night.
‚ÄúWhy is everyone afraid of Sen. Sanders coming to South Carolina? They‚Äôre afraid they won‚Äôt feel the Bern?‚Äù state rep @JustinBamberg asked the crowd.
Nina Turner, introducing Bernie Sanders, has now left the stage to walk amongst the crowd. ‚ÄúThis is about you,‚Äù she says in response to SC critics. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs only one BS I want to deal with and that‚Äôs Bernie Sanders.‚Äù
‚ÄúWe‚Äôre not here for any for any particular candidate ‚Äî were here for you, baby,‚Äù @ninaturner tells the crowd. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs amazing to me that people talk that smack about who can come to this state and who can not.‚Äù
‚ÄúIf he comes to South Carolina, he‚Äôll have his 15 people will show up,‚Äù former state rep @hboydbrown predicted. Not quite. Here is the crowd at his Our Revolution rally in Columbia, though the Democratic gubernatorial and congressional candidates will not be making an appearance. https://t.co/uCBqYEzghf

@econwonk totally. just pointing out for fwiw, which may be nothing. though party is far behind in fundraising.
Time for "blame" is over, DNC chair Perez says. "We will not win the future by relitigating the past. Our unity is our greatest strength."
"cabinet secretaries can fly coach, my friends," says DNC chair Perez, who did fly private w/ Sanders during their Unity Tour this yr.
Perez to his DNC members: "We are stronger because of all the people on this dais... That doesn't mean we don't have pitched discussions."
Before Perez takes the lectern, a campaign-style video promoting "the *new* DNC" plays to members in the audience. #DNCFall17
Munoz intro remarks to #DNCFall17 about Perez were very much in the school of 'wish you could see the Tom I know' speech.
speaking to DNC members, finance chair Henry Munoz just gave a very personal introduction of Tom Perez, starts to tear up at points.
Eric Holder to a hall full of DNC members: "Now is not a time for our party to be beholden to ideological litmus tests."
Some DNC folks expect that there will still be a challenge of Perez's at-large members slate, via formal motion, during this DNC meeting.
Tim Canova, Debbie Wasserman Schultz challenger, also joins the "DNC purge" calls, saying Perez ousted progressives for HRCers/lobbyists. https://t.co/LiXkzwFqLw
"Do not think for a second that this kind of behavior is only coming from the WH," Eric Holder says.		Cites VA gov race specifically. https://t.co/7PeI516JzQ
Eric Holder, keynote speaker at DNC meeting, says he won't call Trump president, just "the present occupant of the White House." #DNCFall17
"World peace." Remember when we used to talk about that, Harry Reid says. #DNCFall17
Harry Reid says Gen. Kelly should be put "back where he belongs": "trying to control Trump rather than control Congresswoman Wilson."
