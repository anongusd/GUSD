@GetOffMyZickk @NYGovCuomo Sorry for the inference I just dont want to be clumped and it seemed these days so many people don’t know the difference between medical and recreational  LOL THANKS FOR UNDERSTANDING
@GetOffMyZickk @NYGovCuomo I was always against Marijuana until I got sick now on Medical Marijuana and it’s been a God Send and I DONT GET HIGH I actually have a life again and actually can walk again, sleep through the night without pain!! So unless you have lived it — don’t speak about it!!
@NYGovCuomo And they are telling us it might go higher if legalized with taxes !!! Most of us can barely afford it now! Is this true - then unless there is going to be a lower tax on medical card user or something like that then please don’t legalized recreational!!!
@NYGovCuomo So if it’s legalized unless a major influx or there is a priority list for those of us with Medical cards it doesn’t seem fair. Also right now the prices from one dispensary to another is drastically different like there is no regulation like $50 or more!Avg month $300+
@NYGovCuomo I am all for the legalization of Marijuana BUT if it’s legalized what happens to those of us who are on Medical Marijuana Half the time we go to get our script now the dispensaries are out of stock. I got off some of my regular meds for this then suffer when it’s out of stock!1/2

@afloridapi @IngrahamAngle @realDonaldTrump Why are #FACTS BAD LET #FBI do their job w/ all this fighting about it this past week it would have been done by now. What is the WH &amp; @BrettKavanaugh afraid of. If he’s innocent then no biggie. In past SCOTUS appts. have been held up to be re-investigated when NEW info comes out
Even if you answer every question w/ I DONT RECALL it won’t matter! The world will hear Christine Blasey Ford &amp; SHE WANTED A FBI BACKGROUND &amp; She WANTED WITNESSES so it makes her story more credible. People will be thinking about that the whole time. REQUEST A FBI CHECK or QUIT!

@realDonaldTrump We all know North Korea moved their nukes before destroying that location You got played They will be making more in no time while Mueller is putting your ass in jail. Maybe if you were the real “Art of the Deal” things would actually be getting done BYEBYE NOBLE PEACE PRIZE LOL
@EdKrassen The WH gave him clearance but I personally think Mueller made this happen ... a inside guy to watch Trump (Mueller had so much on Jared that he probably easy got him to flip)
@nedprice Maybe he is now a plant for Mueller???
@RedTRaccoon Personal opinion: he is now a plant for Mueller
@JoyAnnReid SAD Basically Millionaire owners backed Millionaire President
@JoyAnnReid Trump on #foxandfriends this morning actually said if “they” don’t want to stand for the flag then “they” shouldn’t be in the USA ... so basically he is acting like a dictator if you protest or you will be deported and btw we know what he meant by “they”
@realDonaldTrump NO ONE IS CALLING IT #Spygate but mentally deranged Trump If your people didn’t TALK TO RUSSIA 🇷🇺 than they wouldn’t need someone to inform on them !!! The fact that you are having 2 meetings is SO WRONG 1 meeting with both parties not one to tell the WH your info so WRONG
