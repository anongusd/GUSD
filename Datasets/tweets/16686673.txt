The majority of taxpayers won't see their taxes affected by the new #SALT deduction cap - @ericadyork #TalkingTax
The simplification of three 1040 forms to a single1040 form alone will create a more efficient tax filing process,  and will likely lead to streamlining - @KathyPickering #TalkingTax
On the importance of state conformity: 		25 states have so far acted in some way to make #StateTax changes in the wake of federal #TaxReform.		Broader tax bases = states reporting increased tax revenues due to state conformity with #TCJA - @NKaeding #TalkingTax
#SALT deduction change is a big step in helping make state legislatures and their #income tax structures more accountable - @veroderugy #TalkingTax
Whichever model or analysis you look at,  #TaxReform impacts will be pro-growth - @veroderugy at #TalkingTax
. @veroderugy at #TalkingTax event:  Changes to AMT,  "death tax" among others, have made the tax code less destructive

A1.3: QIP includes investments like upgrading fixtures, new signage, woodwork and other similar improvements. Small businesses grocers and restaurants depend on it to grow. #RetailGlitchChat
