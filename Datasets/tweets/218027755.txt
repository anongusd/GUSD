@Kruzinsolow @Oli88764063 @NikkiHaley You have not given an answer. That other guy explained once the big bang exploded what he theorizes happened. He never gave any explanation of where the matter came from that made up the big bang before it exploded, nor have you.
@KenFWA @AnnCoulter Trump's brain gave him a net worth of $7 billion and beat 16 well funded republicans and the Clinton empire to become president. What are your accomplishments in your liberal mush of cells in your skull?
@Kruzinsolow @Oli88764063 @NikkiHaley Again, instead of trying to refute mine of how matter was created, give us yours? Why are you avoiding it? Science should know, right? Give us the mathematical formulas of how matter is created from nothing and explodes for no reason and billions of years later we have life?
@Kruzinsolow @Oli88764063 @NikkiHaley Once you give us the scientific facts of how matter can come from nothing for no reason and explode into a universe and life and the math behind it, we're all ears. Until then, your explanation has zero logic to it.
@AnnCoulter Give it a rest @AnnCoulter 	Trump is doing his best with almost no help from Congress and the media.
@Kruzinsolow @Oli88764063 @NikkiHaley Okay, then explain the scientific explanation of where the big bang matter came from?

@Oli88764063 @Kruzinsolow @NikkiHaley So 84% of human beings (believe in God) are wrong and 16% (atheists) are right? That in itself is illogical.
@Kruzinsolow @Oli88764063 @NikkiHaley Thank you for proving you have no answer because there is no scientific answer how matter can be created from nothing and for no reason. Have a nice day. üôÇ
@Oli88764063 @Kruzinsolow @NikkiHaley Only 16% of the world are atheists. Most scientists are not atheists. God and science go together.		https://t.co/25HC9Hjnms
@Oli88764063 @Kruzinsolow @NikkiHaley Then explain what physicists say? Have them show us their mathematical formula of how matter can always be here and created from nothing and for no reason? Give us the calculus formula on that please?
@Kruzinsolow @Oli88764063 @NikkiHaley God is not a being. God is inside the universe and everything. Again, rather than debating my explanation, give us yours? Give us your "scientific" explanation how the matter that formed the big bang, came from nothing and for no reason? Maybe you can convince us?
@Kruzinsolow @Oli88764063 @NikkiHaley Where did the big bang matter come from?
@Kruzinsolow @Oli88764063 @NikkiHaley All you have to do is look at human life to know God exists. That doesn't happen by matter appearing out of nowhere, then blowing up for no reason, then bouncing off of itself for billions of years to end up with thinking, reasoning, human beings. So let's now hear your answer?
@Kruzinsolow @Oli88764063 @NikkiHaley God didn't come to be. God has always existed. Now, your explanation of how the big bang matter can come from absolutely nothing and for no reason?
@Kruzinsolow @Oli88764063 @NikkiHaley But while you are watching the video, again please again the "science" of how the Big Bang matter can come from absolutely nothing, blow up for no particular reason and you are left with trillions of stars and planets and human life landing on the moon and using iphones? Explain?
@Kruzinsolow @Oli88764063 @NikkiHaley This video explains it perfectly. Not enough room on Twitter. Atheists believing that the universe can come from absolutely nothing, for no reason, is pretty illogical. 		https://t.co/tO19g7oEMm
