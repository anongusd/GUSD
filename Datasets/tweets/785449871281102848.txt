@MeekMill Well at least his head is on str8. Great job. He'll make a fine husband one day.
@AdamParkhomenko @nita_reddinger You all voted him in office so deal with him
@MeekMill You're not a nigga. You are a King/Man. Okay
@MeekMill Smart move but the opinion you have might be the truth that needs to be told....
@realDonaldTrump There's always a catch 22
@iamcouture_b Probably both 😂
@ISLANDCHULA28 Boom you got it 😂

@realDonaldTrump Its sad you have hatred in your heart. Smh...you make my ass hurt. But the irony is we do need you. Like bad can't exist without the good kinda need. Smh
Social media has become irritating
RT @MiLLStheREBEL: Dear You,	FOCUS ON YOURSELF
@chrisbrown Right
I'm reporting all y'all fake ass celebrity pages....
Anyone interested in my music I've composed? Hit my dm
Tryna fix the broken pieces of my life....
I've loved you for a thousand years  and counting. #ZEEK
@realDonaldTrump China did not hack anything,  but your character gives me notions, you have the means to do it.
@R_Longstreet @realDonaldTrump Preach
@youngthug It's gonna be okay. Hang in there. The dark has its own way of strengthening people.  Xoxo
@realDonaldTrump We need a Panacea,  bipartisan agreement. Without common sense leading the way, we are heading towards a nasty end of humanity.
@realDonaldTrump Defamation of character is what he can sue you for tweeting this.  Smart move! SMH.

I'm cooking ribs Spanish broccoli and cheese rice hot water corn bread with steam string beans. Topped with old fashion cool aid. Anyone want a plate?😀
RT @IAmTonyWarrick: Be careful who you share your plans, goals, and dreams with. Unfortunately, not everyone wants to see you succeed.
@tburages @AlexanderKaty True
@JasonHalle 😂
I'm thinking about shutting down all my social media accounts, change my phone plan to just talk and text. Smh! Some shit ain't worth having.
I tired going to church. But all the odds against me. So it wasn't meant to be.  I wonder why....
Some people are scared to change, scared of change. Just because negativity is great in this day and age, doesn't mean it's healthy for us to stay in that state of a mind. Ijs! We have to do better, as a whole America.
@meat58 @JohnLegere Man. Tell me about it.  Smh!
@Jacquees I pray the Lord open up better opportunities for you where you can see them clearly. Selah!
@richthekid Indeed.  We all have me too.
@kanyewest Instead. I just realized how powerful a simple walk outside can release the pressure of stress.
@LincolnsBible @AlexanderKaty Are Government been gangstas. Congrats! You've just woke up.
@JoyceWhiteVance @AlexanderKaty Welcome to America, where the ones in charge are full blown idiotic and lack common sense. 😂
@RickeySmiley LMAO playing it safe I see. No integrity. Smh!
Tossed and turned all night. Been crying since 4am. My back is up against a stone cold wall and my heart barely beating. My everything is in pain. Smh
@KevinHart4real When are you gonna do a ticket giveaway?
@cottoncandaddy @TiaValentine 😂 he sounds like my kind of man.  Good for him.
@CarolineManzo Yeah me too. I don't find it interesting at all.
I guess that's that. No sense in crying over spilled milk. Life goes on.
So my 7 year old son kissed a girl today. I cussed the principle out politely. Idc what anyone says.  That's my child. I will take up for him.  Regardless. I did talk to my son.
@chrisbrown I'm  PYRAMID 86

Oh now I get my followers back. Dig that. Smh
@kanyewest I never heard of anyone beating AIDS either. Ijs
@joeveahaley1 Lmao
@kanyewest Indeed true
@desusnice Think about it.... He's kinda right.
@kanyewest Yes.  Yes.  And yes.
I know, all I know and don't know, how I know it all.
@leebee4life SMH.  I guess I'm the only one who see the natives are under governments attack.  They wanna strip all people of color from their powers and assets.  Fun! There's a way bigger picture here. A way bigger agenda in play.
So someone tried to hack into my twitter account. Locked me out. I got back in just to find all those I followed are gone. 0 followers.  SMH

@JamilahLemieux @TiaValentine I agree. It really is pathetic.
@nita_reddinger @dwachfwb @realDonaldTrump @GOP I strongly agree. Sad and sick!
@whca A lot of fancy words put together to form a load of crappy, meaningless shit. Civility is supplying Michigan with clear drinking water. Civility is keeping child molesters and rapist behind bars forever. Civility is ensure the public of the people is due fair treatment. Smh
@laurenduca @TiaValentine  https://t.co/vq1ZMMCKMR
@johnlegend In order to move into the future one must revisit the past. Unfortunately, we've been brain washed to believe the past is behind us, when in fact it is not. The past is amongst us right now.
@dwachfwb @nita_reddinger @realDonaldTrump @GOP Smh! Where's all the so called Christians at? This is in the bible. This is written. The bible is a warning of instructions for wise people. Not for fools. We are coming into the last five pages in Revelation. Hitler all over again!
Only if you knew the entire truth. No-one will be saying anything. The N.W.O. is in full effect...accept it and move along....simple as that. It is now out of our hands. This is the will. Smh!
@Ange_Amene @TiaValentine Agreed. Welcome to America. Watch your step. There you have hell to your right. Open door policy, just require your soul. Take a sit and wait if you choose "Heaven" which is on your left. Enjoy you stay here in the Land of the Free. 😌😐
@robinthede @ebenet 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
@rgay  https://t.co/h0TgXAl7oF
@PortiaMcGonagal @TiaValentine Perfect.
@shondarhimes Okay now i understand. Cool.
@Ange_Amene  https://t.co/X1SEEVap0l
@theClaudiaInez Correct: They get upset because they are natural liers and liers hate being confronted with the truth, especially for the world to see by their very own kind. (Nationality)
@Ange_Amene See another misinterpreted my meaning in what i wrote. Let me help you understand. When a European/white woman go against the government with honesty, she is frowned upon. Cause she's going against her own people. Yet no one say a word when we do it to each other
@jonfavs @TiaValentine Do Flint have clean water? Answer: No. Was she wrong then? Answer: No. Is it a laughing matter? Answer: No. Was it appropriate to discuss? Answer: HELL YEAH...so who really is joking? Answer: Washington. Send them ppl clean damn water. Smh!
@RuthHHopkins @AlexanderKaty 1800's is still in effect right now and it's 2018....what does that tell you? How many of our leaders was assassinated in the mist to try to change the European laws? There is nothing we can do about it, but pray about it.
@MiLLStheREBEL  https://t.co/m6f9q9FaP6
@theClaudiaInez @TiaValentine  https://t.co/Uf7fXhWe7B
@Purify_toast17 @TiaValentine We all know this is a European world with European rules and laws. We NATIVES/BLACK people always have and always will be an outcast to them. Nothing we say nor do will ever change that devastating fact, unfortunately!
You know i find it remarkable how artist can have the nerve to tell people like me to shut up and stop complaining, like they once wasn't were i am before the fame. They too lend on someone. Smh! It's sad business!
@Ange_Amene @TiaValentine Mean while, it's totally cool for "NATIVES/BLACK people to disrespect their own. No fuss about that at all.
@renato_mariotti @AlexanderKaty Wow
@_EthanGrey @AlexanderKaty What they meant to say was "He is a bias, prejudice sexist; is the reason why they support him". Mirror reflection of his own kind. Remarkable how many they are isn't it.
@bwa_ron But I'm not😈
@NatashaBertrand @AlexanderKaty @mschlapp @CNN Why not? Isn't their jobs to find out the truth and report it to the people¿

I have some songs i need to sale to an artist. Smh! One of dreams is to be a ghost writer. Just never got around to it. Life right!
If i had the means, i would reach back to the hood and grab all those who are talented and working hard in that talent. I would give them the chance the rest don't. Greed and selfishness is very ugly.
Making peoples dreams come true and investing in one another's talents is the main source of humanity. Shine bright💓🌟
