@CharlesPPierce @neeratanden @ParkerMolloy I just don‚Äôt see defending a veteran who is mocked for their wounds as a venial sin. We are going to have to disagree on this.
@tomwatson Thanks‚Äîappreciate a civil back and forth. Cheers
@neeratanden @CharlesPPierce @ParkerMolloy Hi Neera, I respect your work and I‚Äôm hoping you saw the fuller context in this whole thread. When I said ‚Äúlike him‚Äù I was directly referring to his record of service, as I noted ‚Äúparty aside‚Äù. I‚Äôd say the same for a Dem in a similar spot.
@tomwatson I‚Äôve acknowledged that it could be misread without the broader context. But I was specifically referring to his service and sacrifice when I said people ‚Äúlike him‚Äù. I‚Äôm obviously not going to change your mind and I‚Äôm sorry to have let you down. That‚Äôs my thinking.
@tomwatson I said absolutely nothing about his politics and I did not say anyone should vote for him over his opponent. I would say the same for any Democratic vet in a similar circumstance.
@tomwatson Hey Tom. This wasn‚Äôt an endorsement. Read the whole thread. I‚Äôm saying he should not be mocked for his service.
RT @KasieDC: TONIGHT: Tune in for our special midterm coverage, including @kasie's exclusive interview with @PhilBredesen.		On @MSNBC 7-9pm‚Ä¶
@charles_gaba @ParkerMolloy Thanks for taking the time to investigate further. My comments are not at all related to his policies or, as noted in this thread, an endorsement of his candidacy.
@jeffersonsheir @ParkerMolloy @NBCNews @MSNBC Huh? I thanked her for a productive exchange
@zacharyaltman @CharlesPPierce @ParkerMolloy You should watch this piece I did on women vets running in record numbers this year ‚Äî and most are Democrats. It aired on Sunday Today just this morning! https://t.co/7oCTYZOelV
@ParkerMolloy Thanks for your tweets. I appreciate being able to have a civil back and forth.
@CharlesPPierce @ParkerMolloy Debatable yes‚Äîbut considering they are (in theory) responsible for taking America to war, it‚Äôs a point worth arguing for. In the 1970s 73 percent of members of Congress were vets. That‚Äôs now down to 19 percent.
@MarkHarrisNYC That‚Äôs not what I‚Äôm saying. I‚Äôm saying we should value service from our veterans and appreciate what that experience can bring to the table, not mock them when they come home hurt.
@CharlesPPierce @ParkerMolloy I should have referenced the context in the original tweet for those who may not have seen the clip in question. Apologies.
@DemocraticLuntz @DanCrenshawTX Tammy Duckworth gave up so much for our country and I am grateful to her for it
@CharlesPPierce @ParkerMolloy I‚Äôm a big fan of yours. I‚Äôm not endorsing a candidate and it‚Äôs not over the line to thank a veteran for their service when their injury is being mocked. I‚Äôve also interviewed Democratic veteran candidates and would say the same about them. Party aside.
@ParkerMolloy I understand that. I‚Äôm not urging voters to pick him over his opponent. I am saying he should not be mocked for his service and that I personally appreciate that he sacrificed for all of us.
@ParkerMolloy The piece highlighting Crenshaw also included Democrat Amy McGrath. I had another piece just this morning on Sunday TODAY about women vets running ‚Äî in both parties.
RT @AmyMcGrathKY: So motivated to be standing up for our country by running for Congress alongside so many other veterans.  Thanks for high‚Ä¶

If it's my reporting that you're citing -- this is NOT what I reported. I reported she felt bullied by those protesting her *before* Dr. Ford came forward, such as when one of her staffers received a call from a man who said he hoped she was raped if Collins voted "yes." https://t.co/UBfEnr1eYE

@johnbrougher Point taken. I‚Äôm not saying they did. I do think she would have been more receptive to voting no after Dr Ford came forward if she weren‚Äôt already so dug in
@johnbrougher Not unfair. But some people went farther than has happened before

Justice Kavanaugh
@noonanjo These were not easy to tune out. She was personally threatened. Someone called and said her staffer deserved to be raped. I can‚Äôt even report some of the things she encountered because they are afraid of copy cats. These protests did affect her, and not the way they wanted
@electricsnuff I‚Äôm not saying she is....
‚ÄúThe #metoo movement is real. It matters,‚Äù @SenatorCollins says.		She, however, is going to viewed as a great villain by those in the movement.
(Also I have to say this isn‚Äôt a long speech by Senate floor standards.)
Senator Collins is delivering a full-throated defense of Judge Kavanaugh. And it‚Äôs clear just how frustrated she was by the protestors who accosted her before Dr Ford came forward. She has never wanted to be seen as being bullied or intimidated by them.

@sockalexis2003 I‚Äôm reporting that the sources I‚Äôm talking to who have seen the letter are telling me the allegations are vague. I‚Äôm not making a value judgment. This is simply what Democrats on the committee have found. If they weren‚Äôt vague, my sources would be telling me they were specific.
@AnnikaMortensen No, that‚Äôs not the case. I haven‚Äôt read the letter. It has been described to me as vague: The conduct she is alleging was not specific and could potentially cover a range of misbehavior. I am not making a judgment, I am just reporting the extent of what I know.
@SaysSimonson Of course! Thanks for reading, appreciate it.
@SaysSimonson Joe, when we work on sensitive matters like this, we do our own reporting, and we report it when we have the story. No one likes getting beat by the competition, but publishing before it‚Äôs ready is worse.
The sexual nature of the allegations was first reported by the @nytimes and the existence of the letter was first reported by @theintercept.		-30-
NBC News (me &amp; @frankthorp) contacted every Judiciary Committee Democrat. None would comment for the record; many referred us to Sen. Feinstein‚Äôs statement on the matter.
But in the ‚Äúme too‚Äù era, this could have unpredictable consequences: The two key swing Republican votes, @SenatorCollins and @lisamurkowski, are both women. (Not to mention red state Democrat Heidi Heitkamp.)
It‚Äôs not clear how this allegation will impact the process going forward. It depends what the woman making the allegation decides to do.
Democrats have tried everything they can to stop Judge Kavanaugh from being confirmed to the Supreme Court, where he would fill the seat of retired Justice Anthony Kennedy, a critical swing vote in many 5-4 decisions.		But the reality is Democrats can‚Äôt stop him.
Normally, allegations like these would be discussed in closed session after a nominee‚Äôs public hearing. That session took place last week, but this wasn‚Äôt raised ‚Äî because most Democrats didn‚Äôt know about it.
The ranking member, Dianne Feinstein, has been in possession of the letter for some time, but other Democrats on the committee first learned of it in a meeting Wednesday night. 		That‚Äôs when the matter was referred to the FBI for further investigation.
The woman who made the allegation will have to be more specific with law enforcement officials if any investigation into the matter is to proceed, I am told.		My sources tell me the allegation could be sexual assault, but may also allege lesser offenses.
A woman has made a vague allegation of sexual misconduct against Judge Brett Kavanaugh dating back to his high school day, two sources tell me.		The allegation, outlined in a brief letter, is not specific and could cover a range of conduct, one source said ...

@jasonsjohnson @OverUnderClover I don‚Äôt disagree with you. I think it could make the wave more difficult. However. I also think the wave could be big enough that electing one socialist won‚Äôt matter much, and the House majority could end up looking a lot like the GOP one in 2010.
