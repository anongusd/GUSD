I have kids and I'm tired, and I don't know how to do the twitter. But tomorrow I will start on the #HouseofRepresentatives  so we can #Resist !
want to inform each member of #congress that my family does NOT support the wall, its ideology, or Trump. We just want to work. #shutdown #shutdownstories #resistance @SenCapito @SenatorBaldwin @SenRonJohnson @SenJohnBarrasso @SenatorEnzi
@SenJohnBarrasso Democrats want these things, too!  Party politics are hurting the country, and specifically my family. My husband is "essential", so he has to work, without pay.  I stay at home with our daughter. I've applied for a dozen night shift jobs. I have an MEd. Figure it out.
