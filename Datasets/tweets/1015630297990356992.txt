@IlhanMN @AOC @RashidaTlaib @AyannaPressley You're a #Racist and a liar. Resign today.
@SpeakerPelosi @HouseDemocrats @realDonaldTrump @senatemajldr You're a liar and a drunk. Retire today and make America better for it.
You're making it sound as if they are being banned because they are trans when it doesn't have anything at all to do with that. You're a very dishonest person @SenatorCollins I'm tired of you politicians lying on every subject trying to confuse the public. You should step down. https://t.co/OeR1ZQyDA3
@SenatorCollins Absolutely. And if any of those same people are in the middle of their transition I believe they should pay for their OWN reconstructive surgery, NOT the Federal Government. Which is why they are being banned, not because of who they are. End federal involvement and the ban ends.
@IlhanMN The expression of oppression! #Hijabi
@PattyMurray Of course he will, and he'll get retroactive back pay anyway. Don't tell me you're living pay check to pay check either. Not buying it.
@SpeakerPelosi What People? US Citizens or the Migrant Caravans? And where are you working? It hasn't been Washington.	, that's for sure.
@Jim_Jordan Twitter suspended an acc over this tweet. #Censorship https://t.co/zzXHl2duGi
@RepMcGovern Very simple indeed. 	Step one: Fund the wall like the People want and Need	Step two: Reopen Government	We have seen how untrustworthy the Democrats are. That is why @realDonaldTrump said that the last bill he signed would be the Last he signs without funding for the wall. Simple
@KxnggChriss @fizza29088741 Why you trying to Segregate Race?.
My gawd are u retarded. There isn't a sing #MAGA or a Republican for that matter that would approve of a bigger Government. You seriously are a #StupidWoman https://t.co/xPSosc4Yoi

@RepAdamSchiff @davidfrum So you're still pushing the lie? Cohen will say anything to get out of prison. There's no proof of what you say yet you spew the narrative anyway. And why are you not in a cell for the leaking of classified information? You cry criminal, and you are one. #smh
@AOC @RiversideNYC @UnitedBlackout We're not in the 60's anymore. Your claim to racism is just a wedge you try to use to force a country into division. Now everything racist. It's lost it's meaning and MLK would not be a part of your agenda what so ever. You're a fraud.

@ChrisVanHollen @realDonaldTrump throats. I'm sure that wont end well. All across the Globe people are waking up to the stupidity of your ideology. Truth in this video should be alarming. Wake up people. https://t.co/mHEAtbATeY
@ChrisVanHollen @realDonaldTrump vote for that and millions of people in the US are against it also. So stop what your doing. #FundTheWall and end the shutdown. Simple as that. Vote yes, fund the wall, shut down end. Or keep on flipping the bird to the Citizen of the US and try to force your agenda down our
@ChrisVanHollen No, you're twisting what happen. @realDonaldTrump said he wouldn't sign another bill without funding for the Wall. Period. He meant it. That takes guts to stick to your promise to the American people when the democrats are fighting for globalism. We don't want globalism. I didn't
@CoryBooker Gay Rapist.
@SpeakerPelosi You're a POS Retire with the cash you stole from the hard working American people and get out of politics. Think about, what a true sleaze you are. Spit right in the face of parents who lost their children because of ur stupid policies. I hope the people of Cal fry ur a$$ Wake UP
@PattyMurray @senatemajldr I should NOT have to pay for that. Why isn't that simple?
@PattyMurray @senatemajldr &amp; left it to die at Amazon. She'll b charged with murder yet abortionist kill millions &amp; is a noble cause? I'm not trying 2tell any1 what they can &amp; can't do with their own bodies. Operative words, you, yours, own body. Not mine, not my problem. It's your problem, you created it.
@PattyMurray @senatemajldr My house went into foreclosure, why wont you help me pay that and keep my home? Instead you want to take MY money and give it to a person who choice is to end a life within their self? I don't want to pay for that and I shouldn't have to. The other day a mother had a baby
@PattyMurray @senatemajldr What makes you think that we should pay for peoples abortions? It's their bodies, correct? Why should it be my money that pays for it? What if that goes against my Religious beliefs? How about a bill that let's you opt out of funding abortions in your taxes if you're against?

@ChrisVanHollen @wmata Blame the Democrats. #FundTheWall Gov reopens. Simple as that.
They have nothing to do with what @realDonaldTrump is doing. He stated quite clearly that he wouldn't sign another Spending Bill without funding for the wall. He meant what he said. He doesn't lie. It will remain shut down until the Democrats come to terms and #FundTheWall https://t.co/Xm7O44vxEG
A prolific liar is running for President. What are the odds she also a Democrat? 1 in a million? #MAGA https://t.co/uX6ise8G9k
Here'a a thought. When the census people are out, bring a truck with the ID machine. Census people ask if they want to vote, Then they can go right to the truck and get an ID. https://t.co/hf2XwbJ80l
@EricHolder Voter Fraud isn't democracy you dumb a$$. You protect voter's rights by making their vote count, not be wasted and erased by an illegal vote! Voter ID should be Nation wide and gov issued. The gov is even willing to go to the people with ID machine and hand it to them personally.
@NBCPolitics @NBCNews That's because @SpeakerPelosi is a POS and Melania is his wife and the first lady. Besides, Nancy has Millions and her own jet. She can fly her dumb a$$ anywhere she wants.

@RandPaul @realDonaldTrump He has done more for this Country in 2 years than the past 8 Presidents have done in 38 years! The man is a man of his word. And the most transparent. Obama said he would post Bills so we could see them and comment. Straight up Lied. You weren't even allowed to read them first!
and Special Representative for Afghanistan and Pakistan Richard  Holbrooke. McChrystal was not quoted as being directly critical of  the president or the president's policies, but several comments from  his aides in the  article say McChrystal is  disappointment with  Obama
In an article written by freelance journalist Michael Hastings,  in Rolling Stone magazine,McChrystal and his staff mocked civilian government officials, including Joe Biden, National Security Advisor James L. Jones, US Ambassador to Afghanistan Karl W. Eikenberry,
", but to "degrade" them.	Scott Ritter, former  Chief UN Weapons Inspector in Iraq, stated at the time that McChrystal  should be fired for insubordination for disclosing information that he  should have said only in private to the President of the United  States.
In 2009, McChrystal publicly suggested between 30,000 and 40,000 more troops were needed in Afghanistan,  as the lowest risk option out of a number of possible troop level  changes. He was advised by White House Staff not to present troop  increases numbers to "defeat the Taliban https://t.co/tHgyvI9W4D

You should be cleaning up our oceans, replenishing the rain forest, building with less wood. Stop spraying crap in the air trying to control the weather and then lying to us about it. Do you people ever tell the truth? I'm not done but I have reached my limit on this thread. Cont
The icecap shrinking claim. If they are shrinking why are bottle water companies allowed to mine icebergs and in some cases the icecaps themselves? To me this is the limpidity of an oxymoron.
Plastic, plastic bottles and icebergs. The claim that our icecaps are shrinking. SMH. We still produce un-recyclable plastic. The recyclable plastic we're not recycling. Plastic Bottles are being found everywhere, even on an island that no people inhabit. Why?
there laws preventing people from having solar that benefit the power companies? People in AZ, Fla, TX should be free to have solar panels on their house without penalty. We have many alternatives to produce electricity yet we do not force major electric co. to take this rout.
We have the technology to do this easily if only we would apply it. It would cut that 28% in half. Electricity accounts for 28% also, still. When we have all this technology in alternative electric production why hasn't this number budged an iota over the past 10 years? Why are
Nothing you're doing will combat Global Warming. It's almost comical to see the contradiction in action. Transportation accounts for 28% of green house gases yet we e all still driving gas guzzling automobiles. Why hasn't every car company been forced to produce Hybrid at least?
Global warming. Now here is a very controversial subject. Is it a hoax or is it real? Again we don't know because you people lie so much we have no idea what 2 believe. I've read reports from both Pro &amp; Con on this subject and they both sound factual. So who knows? What I believe
this one Gov be accountable to? Muslims will never bow down to any laws but their own so what is your plan to get over that hurdle, or are you even going to try? BTW, where is my say in all this? I didn't vote for Globalism and the majority of the US do not want it either.
guards protecting you 24/7 while fighting to disarm US. It sound to me we're being thrown to the wolves while you're posturing the illusion of righteousness. You can't even control one country with one Government how do you expect to rule 195 with one Gov? Under who's laws will
ideology with open arms? It makes NO sense. How will we benefit from Globalism? How will we be protected from the violence you've invited into our homes? I know the answer. We wont be. We're being used as fodder. You people don't give a crap about anyone else. You have armed
I know everything that is going horribly wrong with this Country is borne out of Globalism. An Ideology that risks the lives of people in every civilized Nation in the World. Didn't Hitler have the same concept? We fought him to stop that threat and now embrace another Nazi's
preach about woman's rights yet defend a culture that violates every aspect of woman's rights. Against human rights. Children can't even be children. And you don't find that disgusting? Why? What is wrong with you?
Why? Culture Norms? Sharia is not compatible with our Constitution and should not be allowed, ever, into our Country. Yet here it is and it's getting out of control. And you created it. You nurture it, coddle it, helped it grow. It's just weird. On one hand you stand there and
But that's not even close to the biggest injustice you've imposed upon the this great Nation. You allowing a religion that goes against the very core of the US Constitution, against basic human rights, to flourish here in America is just maniacal. And you refuse to prosecute them
Justice in America has gotten so twisted out of shape that I don't know where to begin. @HillaryClinton guilty as hell, in jail? Not at all. Runs for President. Unf***ing believable. Sells #UraniumOne to Russia and you're going after @POTUS for Russian collusion? #SMH
Many other people have the same stories yet u support open borders? Exactly where the drugs are pouring into our country. I know this 4 Fact that weak borders have led to this epidemic. I know a weak border led to #KateSteinle murder and 9/11 Why? Are we just fodder for politics?
The border wall. Why won't you build it? I have had 16 people I knew die of fentanyl overdoses and one murdered by an illegal alien. I can't get the drugs I need because u blame Pharmacy and Drs for the opioid epidemic
You've made this country unsafe for anyone to be able to leave there house and not fear being murdered, raped,robbed, assaulted, accosted, spit on, (which is an A&amp;B. The rule of law has gone out the window and you people are running Ruffshod right thru our Constitution.
our own for your Ideology. Completely insane.	@EricHolder sold guns to drug cartels. US Border Patrol killed by those same guns. Is the man in prison? If I sold someone a gun that killed someone else I would be. But he's not? Why? Special privileged because he's black? Fair?
The War in Syria, again We're trying to tell another country who should lead them. These wars, you claim are for the protection of our freedoms and sovereignty. I don't see it. Instead you overturned a Jumping Jack's nest and expect US and the West to deal with it. Sacrifice
impeached? He violated both the Constitution and the Wars Power Act, and you didn't even censure him. And this man shouldn't even have been able to run for President. You all knew this and again you did nothing! (I could be wrong, IDK, you people lie so much it's hard to know)
across the globe. Why wasn't Bush impeached? It was fake intel and he knew it. Congress knew it too and did nothing to stop him. The war in Libya that @BarackObama started. Again for a regime change where We had no business telling another country who should lead. Why wasn't he
Stirring up the Middle East. Thus began the Hate of the US by ALL Muslim countries. We, no, You had no business being there. You put all Western countries in danger and accomplished nothing in return. They're still killing each other over there and are now spreading their hate
Let's start with the Iraq War. A long protracted armed conflict that began with phony intel which was then fed to the public as Just Cause. But there was no cause. You just wanted to make a regime change to save oil investments boned with Kuwait. All you ended up doing was
