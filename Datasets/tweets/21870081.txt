Big thanks to everyone who participated in the Q &amp; A with me tonight! I had such great time talking with you all! Be sure to follow me @alliseeisgold ✌🏾
@StevePoliti @alliseeisgold I have. He's a good kid, and I believe so. When Andrew walked out on the mat that evening that he would be the catalyst for change in wrestling. But the cool thing about it is, he has people in powerful positions that can now speak on his behalf to make the necessary changes.
@BordenWrestling @alliseeisgold Work on positioning first. Develop a solid stance and basic defense. A wrestler that is hard to take down is hard to beat. Then 1-2 solid attacks. Lastly, condition them. Although you may not be the best technically, you can be in amazing shape. That will be impactful right away.
@TJ_Mullen @alliseeisgold I believe we are back to being a world power. It's been quite some time that USA Wrestling could claim that we could compete for a world team title every single year. Today that statement stands true. With the list of young talent in the pipeline, I don't see us slowing down.
@Erniel125 @calUSAwrestling @alliseeisgold I considered it for a short period of time, but it was only because I was hungry. lol I am the 74kg representative for the USA, and as along as I compete that will be the only weight class that I'll wrestle in.
@OhN00000 @alliseeisgold It's a pretty incredible experience. To walk in the opening ceremonies with some of the best athletes in the world, some of whom I've only ever seen on TV is quite the moment. To represent the country that I love and take pride in is undeniably life changing.
@blockchaingenie @alliseeisgold Find your favorite wrestlers online and mimic their habits. Follow them on social media and do their workouts, follow their nutrition plans, practice their technique. All these things are right at your fingertips on the internet.
@joze_00 @alliseeisgold Stay focused through the mental instability. I know how rough it can be to feel like an outsider away from your team and competition, and less than your best. Although you may not be able to wrestle, there are things you can still do. Lift, visualization, strengthen your faith.
@HorschG @alliseeisgold Very important. If you want to become a better wrestler, you have to wrestle. No matter the style, they all provide benefits for each other. The better you become at each, the more complete of a wrestler you will be.
@nhwrestlefan Always. No matter how good you are the nerves never go away, you just learn how to control them. I always rely on the fact that I've put in countless hours of hard work and dedication in preparation for this moment. I won't let nerves sabotage my performance.
@Johnson_PNW @alliseeisgold I didn't grow up desiring to be an Olympian. I never realized that I could actually be one until college. I was invited to the Olympic training center that summer and I got a chance to wrestle with the Beijing Olympians, and I held my own. I was only 19. The dream was born.
@RSRwrestling @alliseeisgold Hard work works. It sounds cheesy, I know, but really effort and attitude are the only factors you can control. I've seen many men/women accomplish their goals just from sheer will. If you want to be great at something, you have to be willing to work for it.
@til_son @alliseeisgold Ha, I love the Huskers, and I love Lincoln. But I've got some business endeavors that I'd like to get into once I finish up my wrestling career in a few years.
@WanovichK @USAWrestling @alliseeisgold It was the first time I ever committed a full offseason to wrestling. I stayed in Nebraska all summer to train. I lifted and wrestled everyday to prepare for the following season. I realized if I wanted to change my results, I was going to have to enhance my effort. It worked.
@devan_welch @alliseeisgold My biggest rival in wrestling will always be anyone wearing a Russian singlet. They are always my toughest competitor each year. Although, Frank is very solid as well!
@Nursedudesteve @USAWrestling @alliseeisgold I've had so many training partners over the years. A few of them stick out specifically. Bryan Snyder, Jordan Oliver, Chase Pami, Rich Perry. All these guys have great feels and are very knowledgable about positions.
@TeethInterludex @USAWrestling @alliseeisgold Growing up, football was actually my favorite sport. If I wasn't wrestling, I would like to be playing slot receiver in the NFL. That would be pretty cool.
@MCantu45 @alliseeisgold Haha, you might want to get a profile picture first, then we can talk.
@spachterchip @USAWrestling @alliseeisgold After losing in the Rio Olympics my confidence was pretty shaken. Wrestling is a mentally demanding sport. It took me some time to rebuild emotionally. I realized in that period that my identity was tied too closely to my athletic success. Thankfully I was able to grow from it.
@Thunderlips1506 I'd like to see kids develop a little more physically and emotionally before you throw them out for competition. I'd take years to help them improve body awareness, refine skills and know that they truly desire to compete. Then unleash them around age 10.
@Parksnipes123 @alliseeisgold Honestly, I would say being a high school state champion. It was the first dream that I ever had since lacing up my shoes at 5 years old. It was the first time I'd ever had my picture in our local newspaper, and I got a varsity state championship jacket afterward. Timeless.
