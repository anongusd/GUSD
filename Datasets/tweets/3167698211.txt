@Lollardfish To me, his '84 and '88 campaigns built off of Chisholm somewhat but also reflected the divides between the CBC in 1972 and Gary Convention ideas of more radical action.
@Lollardfish I found "a policy idea that I don't believe has ever been seriously debated by major contenders for the party's nomination" to be a little diminishing of Jackson's '88 run.

@Lollardfish Anyway, I liked your piece overall and agree with the need for Sanders to be a thoughtful and vocal advocate for African-Americans if he wants to win or even shape the platform. Just wanted to add some context.
@Lollardfish As VP Al Gore called it a matter of "symbolic atonement" rather than financial compensation, about which he said, "At the end of the day, most agree that it's not a politically feasible idea."
@Lollardfish "...when there's still  so many people living at least with the aftermath of discrimination." https://t.co/PQNAbmwGry
@Lollardfish A few years after this article Clinton was asked about reparations and said, ``What I think we ought to do instead of reparations is to be repairing,' he continued. ``That is why I don't want to abandon affirmative action without an effective alternative..."
@Lollardfish I agree that the difference is notable with multiple candidates supporting at least the general idea of reparations, but I think  Jackson's '84 and '88 campaigns helped to build a groundswell that was reflected a few years later in Conyers' HR40. https://t.co/RI11sf2hBI
