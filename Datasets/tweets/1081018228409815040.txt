@papashawnsky @charliekirk11 Lawsuit claims infringing right to life or paternal rights, etc. goes to SC who then defines a legal person as as any combined genetic material w/ full potential for human life. Fetus becomes legally protected citizen. The battle will never be over when the country's split.
@rekastner @charliekirk11 @tony_oakland Caring for one doesn't negate a concern for the other &amp; insinuating so is a false equivalency.

@jhhenslee @charliekirk11 We're all subject to set laws regardless of our station in life, it's how society functions. We don't euthanize ppl bc their care is a burden.

@Samberg7 @dmuc93 @charliekirk11 Yes, unborn baby girls would likley grow up to be moms &amp; grandmothers. Abortion doesn't just end the life of that child, but of all their decendents.

@Topdekfireblast @MarcGagne16 @LaurenUnderwood @GabbyGiffords Unfortunately if they haven't had a major mental health intervention it won't be in a database and won't show up in a background check. If there was a mental health check component req. as a part of the background check maybe it would actually be effective and create change.
@Topdekfireblast @MarcGagne16 @LaurenUnderwood @GabbyGiffords I said the gun show loophole was closed. You are welcome to read the laws if you actually care and this isn't just a "but what about" responce. 	https://t.co/bENYNXtiBo
@Topdekfireblast @MarcGagne16 @LaurenUnderwood @GabbyGiffords No, I think convicted murders should be executed, so no, I wouldn't support overturning laws that block them from getting firearms. I would throw them back in jail for life if caught with a firearm. This is irrelevant to the fact the law will be ineffective.
@MarcGagne16 @Topdekfireblast @LaurenUnderwood @GabbyGiffords I've never said it was an infringement, stop insinuating I think it is just because I shared facts showing it is ineffective. I have passed Fedral background checks for work far more in-depth that anyone buying a gun will ever be subjected to. My ONLY issue is effectiveness.
@MarcGagne16 @Topdekfireblast @LaurenUnderwood @GabbyGiffords Law abiding citizens get checks bc they go through dealers, who already req. checks. Criminals won't be impacted. I want laws that will actually make an impact.  This is inadequate but will be touted as some great achievement and take pressure off to make more effective changes.
@Topdekfireblast @MarcGagne16 @LaurenUnderwood @GabbyGiffords Indiana selling guns at gun shows fallacy has been disproven. The gun show loophole was already delt with.  This legislation is focused on one on one sales not dealers and doesn't work as shown in Cali.
@Topdekfireblast @MarcGagne16 @LaurenUnderwood @GabbyGiffords That would be a valid point if it weren't a false equivalency. If we were talking about it not be 100% effective your point would be correct. It was shown to be 100% ineffective, no chang at all. Not a small change, no change.
@Topdekfireblast @MarcGagne16 @LaurenUnderwood @GabbyGiffords I supported her &amp; I want the issue addressed too!

@reptscantollie @jordanbpeterson When the 11yr old reads at a college level, yes it does. Why would anyone criticize a young person being intelligent  or wanting to read multiple viewpoints and explor their own thoughts. When did it become desirable to put yourself in an intellectual silo?
@davidseagle60 @reptscantollie @jordanbpeterson If you have data that refutes his ideas please share, at least you could help others find proof of his errors and foster a discussion rather than unproductive sarcasm. 12 rules is the first book of his we have read &amp; so far I'm not sure what people are finding objectionable.
@_Maw_Maw @ArmyStrang Because women are not inherently bad, that behavior is illogical and unproductive, and I'm not fond of senseless yelling.  What in the 12 rules is misogynist? And if there is misogyny in the book I would prefer to discuss it's unacceptablility rather than pretend it dosent exist?
@ArmyStrang @_Maw_Maw It is when you have involved parents who discuss &amp; explain contrasting views &amp; research so their children understand how to logically evaluate contradictory ideas.

@mephist0ph3l3s @evan_flow @jordanbpeterson Not at all, I encourage him to read texts from multiple viewpoints and use reason, research and logic to form his own opinions.

@evan_flow @jordanbpeterson Why? What is your issue with encouraging young people to read well written books from multiple viewpoints so they can build the skills necessary to decide for themselves what they beleive?
