@Hyped_Supras @BarcaBite Really! what kind of tv do you watch because you would really have to be so ignorant to feign this blindness
@AOC Wasn't it this sort of thing a house Republican called a racist for by a house democrat? I wonder why she's also saying she has a black staff because adopting their rules she being racist except if it doesn't apply to them. #Democrat double standards
@jaysweat29 @LindseyGrahamSC @realDonaldTrump This is the most retarded tweet I have seen today. Don't worry I will keep going to see if there are more people wilingl to turn a blind eye on this issue.
@CNN Instead of starting a conspiracy and wasting time and resources typing this make yourselves more useful and try connecting this dots schiff, kamala, jussie and the recently passed legislation
@CNN You know he will and please stop making him look like a doomsday monster

@BreakingNLive @AOC Wow!!!! What a great thinker. .May I ask how many years it took you to arrive at this great piece of junk?
@washingtonpost It seems like a good tactics to diffuse the situation for a Democrat in crisis but you wouldn't do the same for a Republican or their associates.. Pure and deliberate unfairness

@gilleran_m @eugenegu @realDonaldTrump Really!!! And you wasted your thinking typing this?
@eugenegu @realDonaldTrump So sorry but I couldn't help myself to ask don't you think Hillary and the former FBI director should be prosecuted for lying to Congress or do you think there's nothing there to prosecute?
@ELLEmagazine Wow!!!! Xoxo I can't wait
@eScarry It means he lack an objective imagination. Just subjective to his bosses view
@MahaXVIII @BarcaBite He was his worst nightmare. What do you expect
@charliekirk11 They are scared he will deliver on all the lies they have been feeding the masses
@ADHD_Capital Don't think liberals care about ethics when it happens in their own back yard
@DonaldJTrumpJr @TheAtlantic Pls what's twitter's action to this tweet because someone's account was blocked earlier for tweeting a journalist "should learn coding" am I the only one thinking "the joke is too expensive"
@ClayTravis Sincerely it like trump critic are even more of a loser than he his painted to be

@OANN Am quite disappointed. Oppressing people because of their political views is just not the way to go
@WSJ U should be thankful someone was brave enough to do your job
@BreakingNLive Hope they pay darely for their character assassination
@AG_Conservative Wonder if they will call Mr Philips "a liar" because I see no counter evidence against that
@totalBarca He is a gem to watch
@dcexaminer In the liberals world any racist is a Republican
@ml_maria_ @wherepond @saferozie @inabster @alamgirizvi @warrioroftrut @AWAKEALERT @hamsoon Really they are terrorists, which? Isis or alqeada or el shabab
@ml_maria_ @wherepond @saferozie @inabster @alamgirizvi @warrioroftrut @AWAKEALERT @hamsoon And Iran backed too
@ml_maria_ @wherepond @saferozie @inabster @alamgirizvi @warrioroftrut @AWAKEALERT @hamsoon Because the last time I checked they were protesting for his resignation
@ml_maria_ @wherepond @saferozie @inabster @alamgirizvi @warrioroftrut @AWAKEALERT @hamsoon Wow! I will need a very good proof
@wherepond @saferozie @inabster @alamgirizvi @warrioroftrut @AWAKEALERT @hamsoon @ml_maria_ And the war in Yemen is likely another example but I can't even remember the facts about it
@wherepond @saferozie @inabster @alamgirizvi @warrioroftrut @AWAKEALERT @hamsoon @ml_maria_ "That's to the power hungry monters who calls themselves leaders and are ready to kill to retain power. Need an example Assad's  regime"
@charliekirk11 Sorry! Can I get a proof for this. Would really appreciate it.
@wherepond @saferozie @inabster @alamgirizvi @warrioroftrut @AWAKEALERT @hamsoon @ml_maria_ Yeah I saw this earlier and I can get your point and view but, the truth is the so called leaders should know when to call it a quit. you can't rule over people who don't love you with force. if you love your country you should not shed the blood of your fellow country men
@wherepond @saferozie @inabster @alamgirizvi @warrioroftrut @AWAKEALERT @hamsoon But they play the patient dog and do the saviour of out of favour regimes
@PatriciaHeaton @WorldVisionUSA Prayers?? He needs help
@JimmyPrinceton @brianstelter I wonder what is going on in their head right now. If anyone else did this they will be toast
@saferozie @wherepond @inabster @alamgirizvi @warrioroftrut @AWAKEALERT @hamsoon Sorry what is the point of this post again??
@saferozie @wherepond @inabster @alamgirizvi @warrioroftrut @AWAKEALERT @hamsoon Well that is the politics being played everywhere in the world. do you think Putin is backing Assad for nothing in Syria, think again!! everybody has an agenda and he his just not the type to hide in shells
@Dee_NY45 @MC20681834 @AustinBarker @yashar @JerryDunleavy Wait! wasn't he attacked? He is the victim in this investigation, stop acting like he is going to implicate himself
@paulsperry_ @BonnieM22985235 Now the theory is "being white makes you a racist". And even "associating with Trump makes you a racist". The Trump family name has been demonized with racism. imao
@ByronYork So MAGA is now your symbol of racism and intolerance. well let me get this clearly if as a black man I wear the MAGA hat does that make me a racist. And please where is the first amendment in this
RT @people: Third Graders Shave Their Heads to Support Classmate Who Has Alopecia: 'I Feel More Confident' https://t.co/mGejE9Q1Xw
@charliekirk11 Um! Let me guess the media is ironically accessing the situation
@_Quest_ @EmpSheev @charliekirk11 No one cares about your grades, you attacked first by denouncing his facts without confirming it. Which tells a lot about your ignorance, because you didn't have an idea about it you thought it was cooked up. well am sorry! confirm first, then comment!
@tedcruz Wow!!! This is the kind of speech I expect from the so called role models instead they chose to backlash them
@FootbalIStuff God
@CNN "Where is the love"
@girlsreallyrule Really doesn't matter how you put it a rape is a rape. That's a violation of someone's body so it's still a rape "enjoyed or not"

@roflinds As much as I would have loved to condemn the actions in this video. Can I just ask this "where is your full clip and are you sure they are from the school? "if not this is another publicity stunt"
@BlazeTV @deneenborelli 💯💯
@AG_Conservative That's the point they made it sound like those homophobic biggot did nothing wrong
@CNNPolitics Wait!! sorry, who fact checks you, cos you guys really need to be fact checked
@misslaneym Pls just go and see the full video
@CNN @BuzzFeedBen #fact check the news media
@charliekirk11 Wow the media is now a political tool just screen what suit them
@RealSaavedra @DonaldJTrumpJr IMO i think even the media has to be fact checked these days
@EAmaleena @DLoesch 2019 Christmas came earlier than expected for them
@ol_ragg @DLoesch Search on YouTube 2hrs long u dilluted
@gmrobert123 @user_Leslie @Doc_Clark @DLoesch Were they making fun of him cos they have been doing that before he came in so check the video again
@gmrobert123 @user_Leslie @Doc_Clark @DLoesch And pls do so with an open mind before you judge
@gmrobert123 @user_Leslie @Doc_Clark @DLoesch I would suggest you see it again
@improvor @AClementsWKRC @Local12 Seriously! how did you escape childhood? Dam sure you would do the same thing had you been in their shoes
@decidedlyclare @kjhealy Really you are a disgrace
@ScottAdamsSays @DonaldJTrumpJr @CNN please can anyone tell where the right to practice any religion is in the speech I thought the media is meant to fight oppression or are some of them now promoting homophobia. It's so hard to trust the media if you don't belong to group. Pls could the media stop being partisan!!!
@ScottAdamsSays @DonaldJTrumpJr @CNN the eyewitness said the kid behaved wrongly but the video is debunking such claims and seriously didn't any one hear the homophobic stance the preachers took "you worshipped idols that is why your land was taken from you", "you worship eagles"
@ScottAdamsSays @DonaldJTrumpJr @CNN seriously I thought the news media are meant to be professionals but seriously the last few days are telling the media wants you to see what they want you to see seriously I thought there are two sides to a story and as a matter of fact a corroborating evidence
@ScottAdamsSays @DonaldJTrumpJr @CNN Really I saw this yesterday and thought it was just the video of a man drumming to the kids but seriously looking at the way people and the media are taking this it alarming to the direction in which they are taking the issue
@RealSaavedra And he also made his mistakes and nobody made so much fuss. I mean look at Libya for example it became a failed state under Obama administration. He had no plan for Libya after ousting their late President.
@RealSaavedra I think it is what some of the news media have been doing for so long that people are going to judge about from his campaigns to his victory and from his day zero in office. I mean I used to See the news when Obama was in office he wasn't has poorly represented
@DavidRutz @ChrisCuomo Now "a lying President" and "a media that got the story wrong" but always "fact checks the president". Dam I need to stop watching the news
@DavidRutz @ChrisCuomo That's why it is called karma it an unforgiving bi$$$
@ggreenwald They sure didn't "fact check" this
@CNNPolitics 👀👀
@KellyannePolls That's the realty seriously I laugh when potus says the Clinton network but they are actually working like one, it's as if they are still traumatized that he won and are looking for every possible means to usurp him. I think they should change the way they report
@GOP Am so disgruntled with most especially CNN and their coverage of this white house. Am seriously disappointed with it reporting. Used to be my go to channel. Now I just don't know what basis they will use has criticism
@ohmystass That's a waste of human thought
@SebGorka They found out someone else is trying to steal their plan
@washingtonpost Wow all this just to discredit an address he is yet to make
@CNNPolitics Off course she's no different from that whom she so much despise
@GOP @realDonaldTrump Can't to hear what he has got to say
@SenSanders I think potus has delivered that already
@AOC I don't think she should be given a pass
