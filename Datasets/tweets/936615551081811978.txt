@sloughdespond @5thCircAppeals @Scot_Blog As someone who's worked for the @uscourts, your assessment is spot on.  They REALLY care about rules and procedure over truth and justice.  Unless, of course, they break the rules, which happens a lot.  Then the rules don't matter. #Judiciary
In the Fifth Circuit you can have sexual relations with direct subordinates and actually get promoted. #MeToo #Judiciary https://t.co/9PzNtdvOpl
@J_Dot_J Well someone did not study in high school.
@PatriciaGBarnes Why am I not surprised that this came out of the Fifth Circuit?  As someone who has inside knowledge of how things work there, judges and the AO are far more concerned with covering up misconduct than holding people accountable for their misdeeds.
@CBSNews Well...when they do it better and cheaper...  #MAGA  Wait, what?
@MattBinder @RealCandaceO Looks like @RealCandaceO just got schooled in Hypocrite 101.

@Jaime_ASantos As someone who worked for 16 years for the @uscourts, I can answer your questions. It's by design. It's the same reason the AO has a department called the Office of Fair Employment Practices. There is nothing fair about protecting those who commit misconduct. That's what they do.

@AZBankruptcyPro Staffing firm are not the answer.  They are part of the problem.  I know.  I work for one.  They contract with multiple large multi-national corps. They artificially keep wages extremely low for workers for positions that should be classified as permanent.
@WSJ WOW... .11 cents.  Let me do a fucking cartwheel.
@WSJ These stats are complete and utter bullshit.  The U.S. job market has been co-opted by corporations and governments through staffing companies that flatten wages of once highly skilled, highly paid job sectors. Corporate greed in all its glory.  It should be a national disgrace.
Let me introduce you to two of the most ANTI-#metoo, people working for the federal courts in the Western District of Texas.  Surprised they are women? Many are not. https://t.co/eD40BLRKKQ
@RepCuellar I worked for over 16 years for the federal court in the Western District of Texas and I would hardly call my colleagues "hard-working".  What the court executives and brass did however, was use the court as a frat house to bone sleazy, skill-less ladder climbers.

@LadyLawyerDiary @ClerksForChange Completely agree however the "good ole boy" network runs very deep in the heart of Texas.  And sadly, the Fifth Circuit perpetuates the stereotype to where bad actors know they will be protected for abhorrent behavior.
@LadyLawyerDiary @ClerksForChange Ahh... more slaps on the wrists for a privileged white man (presumably given by more priveledged white men) for reprehensible and disgusting behavior in Texas. Just another day of justice in the Lone Star State. #Metoo #TimesUp #harassment

@alysspeterson Just watched you and your Yale Law School classmates testimony at the AO yesterday.  Thank you for taking up for federal judiciary employees. Working in a federal court can often feel like a large divide between the haves (chambers staffs) and the have nots (clerks office staff).
@courtneymilan Texas needs to shape the fuck up.
That same court clerk now has had similar complaints currently lodged against him by federal court employees.  What is even more appalling is he is still employed (and apparently protected) by federal judges in the district he moved to (AZ).
Wow.  @reneeknake was spot on in testifying that the federal judiciary would benefit from a "Workplace Fraternization Policy".  Our court clerk had multiple unethical relationships with subordinates.  When it came to light, the judges let him go quietly to another federal court. https://t.co/z96aJf237z

And lastly, no uniformity of HR policies and practices within the federal judiciary. One court can be very progressive and the court in the next district can be an oppressive, soul crushing place to work with little to no recourse for employees.
Extremely weak leadership and guidance coming out of the @uscourts AO.
Chief Judges who want the title but have little to no interest in actively managing their court.
Unethical HR Managers who actively work to diminish employee rights.  They often have the support of their judges.

Director Duff kept repeating that the reason employees suffering abuse don't come forward is because they want confidentiality.  The only one screaming anything about confidentiality is the federal courts.
@ChuckGrassley and @SenFeinstein stated in the hearing that they have received at least 16 whistleblower complaints involving the federal judiciary.  Federal judges know that it is virtually impossible for court claimants to find a lawyer who will represent them against a judge.
The fact that the federal judiciary's director, James Duff, admitted under oath that the @uscourts has paid out ZERO DOLLARS in misconduct claims highlights the very problem. https://t.co/dJaTDi6dXi
@FixTheCourt @senjudiciary The Western District of Texas is riddled with unethical leadership.  Lots of sexual misconduct and hostile work environments.

@Ccnn35555922 @FixTheCourt You are exactly right.
@FixTheCourt Sadly, Ninth Circuit court execs (with judicial approval) remove public posting requirements of the Model EEO/EDR Plan put forth by the Judicial Conference.  The @uscourts AO doesn't make it easy to find on their website either.
Hey Ninth Circuit, one important step at reducing barriers to reporting workplace misconduct would be to POST YOUR EEO/EDR PLAN PUBLICLY.  This circuit has taken the added steps at removing posting language from their adopted plan.  They HIDE their plan.	https://t.co/cVPYffhO7k
@FixTheCourt How???  Because the Third Branch uses secrecy and fear to keep its workers in line.  They never play by the rules or if they do, they change them frequently to suit their needs.
@HouseGOP Really?  Because we still know of a lot of people out of work or having to take jobs at half their previous pay.
Now might be a good time to remind the @uscourts of the following: https://t.co/vTUIALD0gh
Not surprised. https://t.co/zia8N51Sw0
@mikedebonis You'd better make shell corps illegal so that the ultra rich can pay their fair share of taxes instead of hiding their profits.  The middle class is sick of footing the bill.
@CBSNews @NorahODonnell Why is this woman not in jail?  Oh, yeah, because she is white.  Never mind.
@LeslieProll I can attest, as a former federal judiciary employee, you are constantly told that you are "AT WILL" and have "No Rights"...usually by HR.  The Third Branch has the least EEO ideals and openly violate employees.  The federal courts are where careers and souls go to die.
@FixTheCourt Umm.  I thought giving them lifetime salaries by the taxpayers was to avoid these kinds of conflicts.
@CREWcrew I think we already know the answer to that.
Hopefully the Third Branch will release their report this week too.  #MeToomvmt #ProtectionForAll https://t.co/xN0VGUxOIg

@FixTheCourt All employees must use the EDR/EEO plan processes for ANY complaint against other employees and/or judges.  The judicial complaint process is for members of the bar or public to use.  Going to the police...I don't think is an option especially if you want to keep your job.
@FixTheCourt Here, I'll let you read the 9th Circuit Executive's response to me after simply asking to see a copy of their plans. https://t.co/EvhuYUZQgw
It's our hope that the Office of Fair Employment Practices in the AO not touch any process in the workplace conduct review until the workgroup study is complete and recommendations are made.  They are the most misnamed department in the entire AO.
@uscourts It would be helpful to know how many comments you have received thus far regarding workplace conduct or is that a secret too? Also, will the workgroup members receive all original comments or will they will be heavily scrutinized/sorted by the AO beforehand.

That's odd....the @uscourts has ZERO sexual harassment problems.  In fact they are such a model of what EVERY workplace should be like that they proudly display NONE of their EEO stats for all the world to see.  #metoomen #kozinski #BeTheChange https://t.co/qhSKwKV6R2
"But the scandals recently uncovered in society's most-vaunted institutions -- the Catholic Church, Hollywood and Congress -- indicate that anything is possible."  #metoomovement #silencebreakers	 https://t.co/vxtJtTfrv5
@matthewjdowd Oh corporations love their corporate welfare programs but loath government intrusion into their profit making abilities. #LivingWage #corporatewelfare #TaxScam
Uhh, ditto @uscourts.  And they could use an Inspector General to help police that. Are you listening @senjudiciary @JudiciaryDems? #metoomovement #silencebreakers #judiciary #kozinski https://t.co/d3hubh7cH9
@HuffPost Pants on fire.
The problem reporting in the #Judiciary is the EDR plan process.  Judges HATE having to deal with administrative issues of the court.  Well guess what?  We hate having to deal with horny clerks all of the time.  @uscourts #Metoomovement #appellatetwitter https://t.co/1i66QNYBKC
I'm glad that Chief Justice Roberts took action for the @uscourts.  It's a shame that it had to get this bad to see some acknowledgement and corrective action.  #silencebreakers #metoomovement #noaccountability https://t.co/ea4xrT8Vjx
@ABC No words...
Likewise in the @uscourts.  #Metoomovement #silencebreakers #Judiciary https://t.co/q3wnT92bzz
We'll be listening. https://t.co/sG0qmOtV3q
Agreed. https://t.co/w2QSWZEPq8
I think the proverbial shit is about to hit the fan in the Third Branch.  #silencebreakers #metoomovement #appellatetwitter  https://t.co/jlq8NVY6jQ
@eschor That info should be made available to the public yearly and with names of who paid out.
Oh snap!  #Metoomovement #silencebreakers #Judiciary https://t.co/HvN7CyfCut
@SenateMajLdr How about they give women equal pay for equal work first?

Let's see what the Third Branch is keeping secret. https://t.co/v33TF8fZTd
It's a start...  #Metoomovement #AppellateTwitter #HeForShe #Judiciary https://t.co/lLaGzPNlaa
This has been an open secret to almost all court employees for decades.  If you have a problem, the @uscourts quickly remind you that you are in the "Excepted Service" and can be removed for any reason or no reason.  So sit down and shut up.  #Metoomovement #AppellateTwitter https://t.co/YOt4MW0hoa
Somebody ---&gt; @senjudiciary @JudiciaryDems &lt;--- needs to start raising hell at the @uscourts.  #Metoomovement #silencebreakers #AppellateTwitter #kozinski https://t.co/k6drQnNwAR
@FoxNews @VP @IngrahamAngle Who's going to make the Trump ties over here?
No kidding.  They need an Inspector General appointed, stat!  #metoomovement #silencebreakers  https://t.co/fJdKBuBAib by @chronic_jordan
@uscourts There's definitely a clear tone don't you think?
No wonder people don't come forward with misconduct and harassment claims in the @uscourts.  Geeez  #metoomovement #SilenceBreakers #AppellateTwitter #kozinski https://t.co/HRkWOusdA9
@JohnCornyn @dcexaminer Who's Tim Scott?

@SenateMajLdr Why don't you try passing something that sells itself sometime? https://t.co/aGs4rPqZ2z via @politico
No more #nondisclosure agreements to cover up sexual misconduct.  #Metoomovement #SilenceBreakers #HeForShe https://t.co/RaijMI5W5B

@MrRightVoice @JohnCornyn Oh trust, men do actually know something I don't.  And the only thing I'm afraid of is losing my shit the next time I hear something utterly ridiculous, unfounded and unsupported by fact out of one of your mouths.

If you're making $8 dollars an hour, let me do the math for you.  8 bucks an hour is roughly $16,640 per year.  Spin the cork on that Thunderbird, you're official making $1,580 over the 2017 poverty line ($15,060 for single person).  #yourmove https://t.co/5M0eheOK9V
@JohnCornyn Nevermind.  I don't need you to mansplain it to me.  https://t.co/oxSoMiZ4X3
@JohnCornyn Explaining why it's fake would be a better response than that.
470 Signatures and counting.  Keep it going. https://t.co/1d5XKY4czO #metoo #silencebreakers #Kozinski #courtsmatter
@nancyleong crickets...
And just how does the @uscourts pay for settlements?  You'll never know because they hide the information from the public as well.  #metoo #siliencebreakers #courtsmatter  https://t.co/qK9SrNaClh
@courtneymilan I think you're right.
@courtneymilan Looks delish.  Hey, didn't want this day to go by without saying 'Thank You' for speaking out.  This world could use more people like you.  Enjoy dinner.

@chrislhayes The issues working in the federal courts are very real.  Often times the ones who exempt themselves from the rules are the worst offenders.  https://t.co/P6xe1EGsHG   #Kozinski
This statement should be added to every courts Employment Dispute Resolution Plan so that clerk's office employees are covered too.  @uscourts https://t.co/6IL8hppBaX
Bet it's also gripping the @uscourts too.  #appellatetwitter #metoo #silencebreakers   https://t.co/cCtKmlJnpj via @politico
Here is the letter to address harassment in the federal courts.  https://t.co/P6xe1EGsHG #MeToo #courtsmatter #silencebreakers #Judiciary
@nancyleong Shameful but not surprising.  Women in the judiciary are some of the worst at backstabbing and not supporting each other....which of course, the males in power love.  Sigh. #appellatetwitter #courtsmatter
@CBSNews @krisvancleave Looks like there was some current construction going on at the site.
LOL https://t.co/keXSsoIbHS
And now we know why Judge Kozinski retired.  Now the Judicial Council will close the inquiry and the taxpayers will foot the bill for Judge Kozinski's lifetime salary of $213+K per year.  #Kozinski #Judiciary #metoo #SilenceBreakers https://t.co/lbAMlfiv2r
Here is the full statement from Kozinski. https://t.co/fHCztvQPZo
Yes! @uscourts.  Who's next??  #metoo #SilenceBreakers https://t.co/OIGEF11z8W
Just another southern, ultra conservative, family values federal jurist doing what they do best:  lying, cheating and wife/mistress beating.  I mean, why go to a bar when you can just go to work?  #metoo #silencebreakers #courtsmatter  https://t.co/dFaEIIjt55 https://t.co/MsccDGrwOu

Funniest thing on Twitter today! https://t.co/HQrwtfojz9
@courtneymilan Being from the South, I love your drinkware.
@Slate The problem with the courts is that each chief judge is the king of their domain. They have complete autonomy to do whatever they wish, sexual harassment included.  They are vehemently protected by secrecy provided by the Administrative Office of the US Courts @uscourts
@JohnCornyn This could only happen if the government only hired Independents.  I worked for federal judges for years.  Trust me, they're partisan too.  #CourtsMatter #Judiciary
At the @uscourts #SilenceBreakers don't get an apology, they get a pink slip.  Perpetrators get protection, promotions and lifetime salaries.  #metoo #CourtsMatter #Judiciary https://t.co/Ys1xWrdcMC

@courtneymilan Thank you so much!
And not only do judges cover for each other routinely, they have the AO @uscourts protecting their asses as well.  #metoo #silencebreakers  https://t.co/23UU861ZW9 via @Ty_Clevenger
@USSupremeCourt1 What about secretive judges?
Clerks of Court Behaving Badly. https://t.co/vfps5Mzksm	The chief bankruptcy judge let this one go quietly to another court without so much as a smudge on his record. The woman was forced to resign and lost her career. #metoo #silencebreakers https://t.co/di1nCaFvDV
@courtneymilan I've started a Facebook and Twitter page to shine a light on sexual misconduct in the @uscourts.  Please help spread the word.  Thank you for your bravery.  #MeToo #SilenceBreakers

@Ty_Clevenger Just read your report on the death row inmate sentenced by sloshed Judge Smith.  Please have your reporter friend get in touch working on the sexual misconduct in the judiciary story.

@senjudiciary @judiciarydems What does the Administrative Office of the United States Courts do? They shield the offenders by hiding complaints against them from public view. Demand that the judiciary publicly publish all EEO complaints now! #metoo #siliencebreakers https://t.co/qyPGZY65ft
