"Full employment is one way that workers gain enough bargaining power to increase their wages; employers have to pay more to attract and retain the workers they need when idle workers are scarce."
"This means that confident proclamations that we‚Äôve achieved full employment should not be made and that the Federal Reserve should hold off on any further interest rate increases and allow the economy to continue to grow."
"However, there is no sign that we‚Äôve reached the limits of how much we can sustainably boost wage growth with lower unemployment‚Äîwage growth remains weaker than we should expect in a fully healthy economy."
"If the unemployment rate is allowed to continue to fall, eventually low unemployment should boost low- and middle-wage workers‚Äô leverage enough to see steady and large wage gains."
