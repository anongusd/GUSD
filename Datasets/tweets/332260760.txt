@Tlgitw1 @PsychoResist @JeffJustice83 @EdKrassen @SpeakerPelosi So what is your point genius? Do you not understand that all immigrants and/or illegal immigrants are not ALL killers, rapists, criminals &amp; bad people as the pendejo of the US has stated? You‚Äôre saying they all are because they don‚Äôt have papers/passports.
@Tlgitw1 @PsychoResist @EdKrassen @SpeakerPelosi And Obama and Clinton approved the repair to the fencing along the border. What was not approved was claiming people‚Äôs property, digging up Indian burial grounds, dividing parts of AZ &amp; TX and a fence in areas where it simply cannot be built.
@Tlgitw1 @PsychoResist @EdKrassen @SpeakerPelosi Those are areas that border AZ, TX and NM - not California. Anyone who attempts coming through the terrain along CA that does not have a wall is literally expected to repel from mountains. But please, let‚Äôs continue talking about your brainwashed nonsense.
@Tlgitw1 @PsychoResist @EdKrassen @SpeakerPelosi Evil? Really? Everyone on the other side of the fences bordering Mexico, the gate for the Vatican, a fence around a persons home (including balmoral &amp; buckingham palace) and apparently outside of heaven are evil? You‚Äôre not in either of those places my fellow evil one. #BeBest
@Tlgitw1 @PsychoResist @JeffJustice83 @EdKrassen @SpeakerPelosi By your logic everyone not from the US is a criminal. I love my family too. And both your family and mine immigrated here at some point.
@PsychoResist @Tlgitw1 @EdKrassen @SpeakerPelosi It‚Äôs a waste of money. There are mountain, desert, landmark and Native protected areas along the border that a wall can‚Äôt even physically be built on or near. That is unless the US robs their land. ü§î https://t.co/VXLAp3Hvmk
@Tlgitw1 @PsychoResist @EdKrassen @SpeakerPelosi Security is welcome. A wall will do nothing to solve illegal immigration, crime or drugs. Not all immigrants come from the southern border and not all who come from the southern border are coming here to harm people.
@JeffJustice83 @PsychoResist @Tlgitw1 @EdKrassen @SpeakerPelosi The insinuation was that immigrants, from S. border, w/out passports come to kill people in the US. We have plenty of psycho homegrown killers üö´ from S. border üö´immigrants who do this. Generalizing everyone coming from the S. border is wrong.

@onthecurbprodu1 Yes!
@onthecurbprodu1 We don‚Äôt help by leaving people to die or preventing them from doing this legally: closing the border/using rubber bullets/using tear gas/flash grenades. That is not the US. We discuss and step in to resolve these situations - usually with the leader of that country.
@onthecurbprodu1 He was fully aware that first generation immigrants were the ones getting the bad end of this deal and their children would remain and attain degrees and work at younger ages - contributing to the US. Again it‚Äôs separating families but parents will go for their children.
@onthecurbprodu1 This was not a good deal. DREAMers could stay as long as they were in school while their parents could be deported - even after living here for years. They would have to attain full citizenship within an impossible amount of time to meet and ICE would and did enforce deportation
@onthecurbprodu1 So @ the largest border POE San Isidro - Mexican people were and are going through the process legally. It is typically not Mexican people storming the border. The asylum seekers have to set foot on US soil to claim asylum. We closed the border and have not allowed them.
@onthecurbprodu1 It‚Äôs the families taking the risk. It‚Äôs out of desperation. If you‚Äôve not been in that position, you won‚Äôt know or care.
@onthecurbprodu1 The US could not locate the majority of the parents deported. Again most were from Honduras and El Salvador - not mexico. But when he speaks of the border he leads people to believe it‚Äôs all Mexicans. There are hundreds of children still being detained.
@onthecurbprodu1 DT through his new zero tolerance policy intentionally separates the parents and their children. Adults are arrested &amp; families delegates. It automatically makes the adults have a criminal record &amp; cause for deportation - then he was forced to reunify the families months later.
@onthecurbprodu1 Yes and the three facilities held unaccompanied minors found attempting to or after having crossed the border. It‚Äôs a wonder they made it. Their parents might have lost their lives or could not afford to go themselves.
@onthecurbprodu1 Right. Persecution and violence will be something they have to prove.
@onthecurbprodu1 MX doesn‚Äôt have the resources for the asylum seekers/caravan. That‚Äôs why you see people living in tents on the mud and in the cold. It‚Äôs the community donating food and clothing. And right on the other side of a tall chain link fence is the US.
@onthecurbprodu1 I honestly believe if we sent more resources (case workers) to process people quicker, there would be less turmoil at the boarder (any crossing). That‚Äôs not to say &amp; let everyone in bc the process does ensure criminals cannot enter &amp; proof for asylum.
@onthecurbprodu1 Those who are here and have visas to work should be able to stay even though they are not yet legal. The process is long. My grandparents did it though. If my family would have been deported - we would be in a foreign place that is no longer our home.
@onthecurbprodu1 My family was helped by Cesar when my grandpa fell from picking fruit and broke his arm. Major bread winner was not able to work and the company got rid of him but offered to take the women to work or they‚Äôd get more people from the border.
@onthecurbprodu1 It‚Äôs out of desperation to have a better life. My family crossed, followed the crops (ID, TX, WA, CA), worked the fields. I‚Äôm second gen but the first gen of my immigrant family all graduated college and worked for what we have. (3)
@onthecurbprodu1 If he is able to make the $ to bring his family through a coyote, they face the same circumstances. They may be killed, raped, held for ransom. If the man cannot pay typically a body part is cut/sent as a message. Some pay the ransom and the family is killed either way. (2)
@onthecurbprodu1 The family can only afford to pay thousands to a coyote to get him across the border. The border is large, dangerous &amp; tumultuous. He may be killed and thrown in the river or by chance make it over here where he will work to hopefully bring his family. (1)
@onthecurbprodu1 So that would be correct for the thousands of people on the southern border who are in process but do not cross over. They have to wait &amp; have been. Those from Honduras/El Salvador are fleeing violence, poverty &amp; persecution of which they will need to prove fear for their lives.
@onthecurbprodu1 It has and illegal immigration has dangers no one can imagine. People are kidnapped and held for ransom, killed or die trying to cross over, trafficked, used and abused. Not all immigrants come from the southern border at San Isidro though.
@onthecurbprodu1 So my point is that the experience isn‚Äôt there in DT to handle these situations. Instead we hear the comments from his rallies that further the message of hurting, hating and generalizing a race or people as criminals, rapists, etc.
@onthecurbprodu1 More than agree on this!
@onthecurbprodu1 That could change
@onthecurbprodu1 Historically, when refugees, asylum seekers and immigrants came to the US, our President would reach out to those countries and those leaders and discuss what is happening. The US was strong, just in these situations, able to assist, negotiate or remedy the problem.
@onthecurbprodu1 Another scary thing is the way the world views the US now. Does no one advise DT on what to do and say? It is embarrassing for him and us but on these issues of asylum and immigration, he also lacks any sort of knowledge of what to do in his position.

@onthecurbprodu1 That‚Äôs a mockery. Cesar held peaceful protests and was still hurt many times by police and border agents. His family was threatened with death, he was assaulted, arrested and harassed for caring for people and organizing them. Very sad.
@onthecurbprodu1 @quincy_walters @AyannaPressley @Ocasio2018 @WBUR Guess who fought for immigration reform while Obama was in office? However, I‚Äôd bet I fought for completely different reasons. Like Cesar, for protection of those who come here and work, who have children here and who get deported to a place that is no longer their home.
@onthecurbprodu1 Immigration reform - because farmers would replace their farmworkers with other illegal immigrants who they could use for cheaper wages or not pay at all. When they no longer needed them, they‚Äôd have them deported.
@onthecurbprodu1 Obama did not have blanket policy to prosecute parents and, therefore, separate them from their children as there is now along with zero tolerance.
@onthecurbprodu1 @quincy_walters @AyannaPressley @Ocasio2018 @WBUR Cesar or Caesar? Two different people. Caesar wanted to better his country and support it hence wanting people to stay in his country and better the economy. Cesar was an immigrant and fought for the rights of those working in the fields &amp; he led peaceful protests.

@bobthelegend98 @nickallen2001 @OurRevolution The US dispersed the crowd of people who had been there years/months/weeks w/ tear gas, rubber bullets &amp; flash grenades to prevent them from touching US soil. Because that is when we have to hear their claims for asylum w/out turning them away. We need resources there.
@bobthelegend98 @nickallen2001 @OurRevolution The incident started with a march in protest from a group of people who were already there for months before the caravan arrived. They‚Äôve been going through the process legally as instructed by the US. Some tried to cross over the MX side &amp; no one made it to the US.
@bobthelegend98 @nickallen2001 @OurRevolution We also used flash grenades and rubber bullets. Look, I get that there is desperation on both sides but we aren‚Äôt dealing with stone cold criminals. These people have come seeking asylum and many have their children with them while others have died trying to come here.

@nickallen2001 @LHollan @OurRevolution Nick, some native born people in the US are criminals &amp; killers &amp; are NOT people who came from the boarder/MX etc. Sure we can say maybe someone coming from another country is not good - but not all immigrants are bad. I get your example, but we grow them right here at home. https://t.co/tISBoMy0YT
@nickallen2001 @LHollan @OurRevolution For some of these immigrants, it‚Äôs been close to a year since they‚Äôve seen their children and MX was no longer their home. It is beyond difficult to get back. MX is dealing with the caravan as best as it can with what resources they have - but this is in Tijuana.
@nickallen2001 @LHollan @OurRevolution Come on now. You know that those in the caravan are seeking asylum. DT wants them to seek asylum in MX. We have immigrants from MX who are in the process of citizenship and everything is at a halt while their children are in the US (if they were not deported) or in a camp.
@nickallen2001 @LHollan @OurRevolution Bravo to you being an ass! üôåüèΩ And the point is that not all immigrants are criminals, crossing the border to take jobs, rape and rob all of you.
@nickallen2001 @LHollan @OurRevolution My mom is a retired kindergarten teacher - my dad a retired 4th grade teacher. My dad has both a BA in teaching and an MBA. My uncle started the United health centers in CA rural areas. And all my uncles were in the military. Immigrants are not all criminals.
@nickallen2001 @LHollan @OurRevolution BS you meant Mexicans. My family is from Mexico and my grandparents along with my aunts, uncles and my dad came here following crops. They lived in MX, ID, TX, WA, AZ and CA. They crossed the border. Each of my family members learned English, went to college and has a degree (1)
@nickallen2001 @LHollan @OurRevolution Oh - because there is only one border and only Mexican immigrants coming to the US - who you assume are all criminals? And who DT says are terrorists and rapists? üôÑ

@wheelchairswag1 @ChattieCathie1 @OurRevolution The US has been running a deficit for years all Americans have a bigger net cost than contribution: 1st generation immigrants, 2nd generation immigrants &amp; those of us who have been here for three or more generations. That‚Äôs a failure of tax policy, not a story about immigrants.
@wheelchairswag1 @ChattieCathie1 @OurRevolution Members of the second generation are among the strongest economic and fiscal contributors in the U.S. population with tax contributions greater than their parents and the native-born population.
@wheelchairswag1 @ChattieCathie1 @OurRevolution While a first generation immigrant does impose fiscal costs, those costs are more than made up for at the federal level by the second generation (the children of immigrants).
@wheelchairswag1 @ChattieCathie1 @OurRevolution The study from the WH is misleading. The number you reference stems from the combination of worst-case assumptions. The numbers are estimates and depend on various factors, including immigrants‚Äô age, education and timeframe examined.

@ChattieCathie1 @wheelchairswag1 @OurRevolution In addition to the citizenship path that would take up to 12 years, a $25 billion "trust fund" was included for a border wall and additional security upgrades on the southwestern and northern U.S. borders. Again - not all immigrants come from 1 border!!!!!
@ChattieCathie1 @wheelchairswag1 @OurRevolution He was proposing a path to citizenship for an estimated 1.8 million young undocumented immigrants in exchange for hard-line steps to increase border security and curb LEGAL immigration. https://t.co/dAW5pql7z7

@wheelchairswag1 @OurRevolution Frankly - the process is hard, it‚Äôs long, the families want a better life, women are fleeing DV &amp; are concerned for their children‚Äôs futures, people want to work. This administration makes it about skin color &amp; 1 border. And many come here legally then get deported!
@LHollan @nickallen2001 @OurRevolution The majority of the immigrants who do make it across that border - your ‚Äúillegals‚Äù are long time residents connected to the workforce &amp; their communities. But NOT ALL immigrants are from Mexico &amp; the southern border. #LearnTheDifference‚úåüèΩ
@LHollan @nickallen2001 @OurRevolution And 2/3 of our immigrants have lived here for more than 10 years w/ US born children who are being deported. The process to get here isn‚Äôt easy and naturalization here is tougher. My parents and grandparents did it and others deserve the opportunity - not tear gas. ‚úåüèΩ
@nickallen2001 @OurRevolution The majority of our immigrants who everyone is calling ‚Äúillegal‚Äù are long time residents - connected to the workforce and their communities. Your unauthorized immigrants are not all from Mexico and the southern border. It is the largest decrease in years! Learn it ‚úåüèΩ
@LHollan @nickallen2001 @OurRevolution The outflow of people along the southern border has topped the inflow. This is the rhetoric of this administration saying there is a ‚Äúcrisis‚Äù on the southern border when illegal immigration from Central America continues to be an issue.
@wheelchairswag1 @OurRevolution And I worked alongside many organizers regarding the deportations during the Obama administration. The Obama administration did however create DACA for more than 800,000 DREAMers which I do respect.
@wheelchairswag1 @OurRevolution This is #fearmongering - it makes everyone afraid of someone who is not the same skin color, who is an immigrant or speaks another language. And it gets everyone assuming the people mentioned above are criminals, drug dealers, terrorists and don‚Äôt deserve to come here. https://t.co/phtijD2lqe
@wheelchairswag1 @OurRevolution Obama did not have a separation policy. This is the effect of DT‚Äôs zero tolerance executive order. It means that anyone caught crossing the border illegally is to be criminally prosecuted, even if they had no previous offenses. Adults go to court &amp; children are sent to a camp.
