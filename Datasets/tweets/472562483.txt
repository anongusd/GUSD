@BenSilesky I'm upset hes doing this after opposing 732, exempting oil refineries and coal in his bill among other big polluters, and doing nothing this year during the biggest democratic majority in decades. It was a fast flip flop.

Republicans keep interrupting, yelling, and being generally uncivil. Democrats are behaving like adults. It was the same thing during the Kavanaugh hearing.

This is why Democrats like myself are willing to call out crooks like @DWStweets openly, knowing our country is stronger when people who do not properly do their job are booted, even if we are from the same party. Country ahead of party. Republicans won't do this.
Watching congressional testimonies nowadays is really interesting, you have liberal democrats versus objectivist Republicans. It creates a very weird dynamic, where the objectivists simply don't care about evidence, and the Democrats do.
If @RepGosar honestly doesn't believe #Cohen, and the clear evidence he should listen to all of the other people who have come forward with evidence, and put America ahead of party and Russia. I believe Cohen, Manafort, Flynn, and Mueller. Their testimony is aligned.
@EdKrassen The @DNC had standing to stop them, as did the justice department under @BarackObama and they did nothing. These actions by the @GOP were crimes, violating the #votingrightsact, but the law is useless if it is not enforced.
@EdKrassen I am referring to voter ID laws which disenfranchised African Americans, shorter polling hours, merging of precincts and other actions which made it more difficult for Democrats to vote in Michigan, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, and Florida, which threw the general election.
@EdKrassen I'm not referring to the primaries, Clinton won fair and square. I am referring to the General Election, the systematic voter disenfranchisement which happened over our country from 2011-2015 which disenfranchised millions and threw the election to Donald Trump.
Who else wants to bet that after the testimony today Trump is going to take a one way ticket to Moscow?

@vicenews Most likely scenario: his presidency is found to be unconstitutional and all of his actions are null and void.
This should make the current official results null and void, and she should take office immediately. Also, all of Trump's decisions would have been unconstitutional so they are null and void. @HillaryClinton would get the opportunity to make her own decision in every instance.
Most important of all, if we discover #collusion between the Trump campaign and the states of Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, and Michigan to swing the election, we need to count the votes properly and give @HillaryClinton her rightful place as President which she deserves.
If you are an American  you are being robbed every time @realDonaldTrump goes to #maralago.
The answer to the extent of my knowledge is no. If Ford was involved in Watergate he and Nixon conspired against the United States. This should have made his pardon null and void.

@VladGutman I expect I will be able to take the train to Ashland before I am going to be able to take a reliable bus to the 101 Steamboat Island road intersection. And we aren't going to get that for many decades to come, if ever at our current rate.
@VladGutman That would be nice, if Steamboat Island ever got transit, which I am not counting on any time soon, we are not very densely populated, and there a hundred denser places in the county which need transit more than we do which don't have it yet, and aren't likely to get it.

@VladGutman @typewriteralley Payroll is almost as regressive as a sales tax...
@VladGutman The reason I have is because when people choose whether to ride the bus or not they have already bought a car or not. The margin day to day is whether to drive or bus, and for soneone like me who has family far from any reasonable transit, I dont really have a choice.

@auralcomposting @amazon @Google @Microsoft @IBM @comcast @kashhill @facebook @Apple Part of this is due to big mergers, part of this is building a service to the same quality as what Amazon and Google provide is very time consuming and expensive. You will end up reinventing the wheel, which is why there are only 2 companies that large in the world.

@auralcomposting @amazon @Google @Microsoft @IBM @comcast @kashhill @facebook @Apple Google is definitely the most difficult. Google Maps works everywhere and is better than openstreetmap. Youtube has the biggest library of music available anywhere. You could stop using Gmail, but that would require you to start your own domain to make something comparable.
@auralcomposting @amazon @Google @Microsoft @IBM @comcast @kashhill @facebook @Apple Other online retailers do not have the same quality of service as Amazon, and when it comes to copyrighted goods, Amazon tends to have really good deals with the multinational corporations which own such works.
@auralcomposting @amazon @Google @Microsoft @IBM @comcast @kashhill @facebook @Apple Cutting out Microsoft and Apple are the easiest, I barely use their products ever. Cutting out Facebook is more difficult, it just takes effort to get the phone numbers of everyone you want to be in touch with (whether that is actually better TBH).
An example of this is as I look for a cloud computing service I can choose from @Amazon, @google, @microsoft, @ibm, and other options to run my application. There is no other place in town to get internet service if @Comcast messes with my life line to work.
In my field, this gives me no choice but to use @Comcast. I have no other option in my city for high-speed internet. This is a true monopoly. Amazon only dominates, they are not a literal monopoly. Comcast is a literal monopoly. We need to break up @Comcast in every way we can.
If I want to work I MUST use @Comcast. @Tmobile is good (though that's another issue altogether given the small number of cell phone providers) and support #netneutrality, which Comcast opposes, but I have a data cap with my cell phone.
If I don't want to use google, I can use @DuckDuckGo. If I don't want to shop on Amazon, I can do @Newegg, @alibris, or many other third party retailers. I don't need Facebook to survive.
That company is @comcast. They have over 26 million subscribers. One in 6 households in America is a customer of comcast. That's more than the number of people who use Apple Mail.
Everyone is talking about breaking up @Amazon, due to their size, but we are forgetting one company which knows literally everything about out online activity, which dwarfs the information held by @Amazon, @google, and @facebook combined who can't compete with it.

as his administration comes tumbling down. He will likely be indicted soon, and his inability to work with anyone who doesn't have to give him what he wants show that he is hell bent on destroying the United States, which I am convinced is what he was planning to do all along.
@realDonaldTrump knows this. The wall is unpopular, as is he. The most unpopular first term in American history, as well as the least legitimate president in history, losing by over 2 million votes to @HillaryClinton. The Wall is an attempt to placate his voters
The problem lies here solely with the fact that @realDonaldTrump is losing, and he is losing badly. Paul Manafort is in prison. Roger Stone is in prison.  It is highly likely the #MuellerInvestigation is going to indict @realDonaldTrump and @mike_pence very soon.
Despite all of this, these men, love them or hate them, kept the government open as best as they can. Defeated by the Supreme Court, Congress, or Republican Presidential candidate, the government was never closed for more than a month, and most of these ended in no shutdown.
George W Bush wasn't able to get a constitutional ban on gay marriage, and @CarterLibrary wasn't able to stop the Iran hostage crisis which was being instigated by Ronald Reagan. The list goes on.
Presidents don't always get what they want. @BarackObama didn't get high speed rail. @BillClinton didn't get #hillarycare. The affordable care act was passed over the veto of @GeorgeHWBush. Even the 'Great communicator" wasn't able to get organized prayer in schools.

Democrats are literally a coin toss away from a trifecta in #Virginia.

There were major pickups in state legislatures all across the country for Democrats, unfortunately most of them were not enough to break Republican Trifectas.
Picked up the #Minnesota State House! But unfortunately we don't have the Senate, yet.
and another new trifecta in #NewYork
Last night we broke Republican #trifectas in #Wisconsin, #Michigan, and #Kansas. We gained a Trifecta in #Colorado and probably in #Maine as well.
@realDonaldTrump You deserved to lose the Senate as well, but you disenfranchised enough African Americans to keep hold of the Senate.
@krassenstein He came really close to losing the Senate and 3 major governorships. The fact he didn't with his popularity is a major victory brought to you by voter disenfranchisement.
#Florida's margin was less than 1%. More eligible voters were turned away from the polls than the margin of victory. It was also a spoiler effect. The redistricting for around 27 seats in the House hangs in the balance.

Between Michigan, Wisconsin, Florida, and Ohio, the winners of these blue/purple states will sign off on the redistricting of 65 seats of the House of Representaives, 15% of Congress. #VoteBlue2018.
The two most important easy pickups this year are in Michigan and Wisconsin, so we can pick up a bunch of seats there. Florida and Ohio are both toss ups, which together send 43 Representatives to Congress, almost 10% of the House.
Governors have the ability to veto unfair redistricting maps. Get Democratic Governors this year, get the House of Representatives and numerous legislature pickups in 2022. Otherwise, we might never get Congress again in the next decade.
There are no fewer than 8 easy Governor pickups for @TheDemocrats this November. This is our last chance to get a majority of Governorships until 2022. Go #VoteBlue2018!

Alienating voters in #RankedChoiceVoting all but guarantees you will not get a lot of second choice votes, and likely lose the election. This doesn't necessarily mean you must be a moderate to win. You need to represent the majority of people.
With no vote spoiling, as long as you rank the candidates your vote is not wasted. Plus, if a candidate is alienating a large section of voters they won't get the second choice vote, which is where most #RankedChoiceVoting elections are won.
#RankedChoiceVoting is different, with enough candidates vying for your vote, if one candidate is makes you angry, another candidate will speak a message of hope which will attract your vote, anger is punished in such a system. Plus, there is no vote spoiling.
We need a system which punishes name-calling and rewards ingenuity. #firstpastthepost fails at this miserably, rewarding candidates who can incite anger, and divide voters. Turning voters off is rewarded in our system.
This will bring every important issue to the table, and encourage politicians not to insult each other because it will cost them second choice votes. Candidates will be able to see accurately where people fit at the various points, and this will improve us.
We need #RankedChoiceVoting if we are to have a healthy democracy. We need to have candidates up and down the political spectrum in the general election, ideally no fewer than 6 which represent the entire spectrum.
In my 4 years of lobbying experience, I have learned that it is much easier to get good policy when you have good people in government. The best way to ensure this is through fair election systems.
The best response moving forward is to work with @fairvote to improve our election systems state by state, particularly ensure @FairVoteMaine succeeds in being implemented before the 2020 elections.
In my future career, I need to learn that no matter how bad the policy is, it is important to not ever call people names, it is #immature and doesn't improve anything. It only makes people angry.
I swore at him, which was wrong, but what we need to learn to do is no matter what horrible policies have been put into place, most people vote for third parties because they don't understand our election system.
I had a conversation with a friend who voted third party, which I believe was the main reason why @realDonaldTrump is in the @WhiteHouse. He had voted for @DrJillStein instead of @HillaryClinton, which I believe spoilt the election.
Perhaps the hardest political skill to learn is how to discuss with people with slightly different views and different tactics, which you believe are destroying the movement.

@aditya_asawa But you won't have the capital to do it early. It is possible to win as a fascist state and switch between the two once GDP is strong
@aditya_asawa Capitalists care far more about having a strong and free economy than having low taxes, later in the game you can make it a state run
@aditya_asawa As soon as  you can, increase your income taxes to a point to pay off your debt and pursue the policies above for GDP growth.
@aditya_asawa I usually try to eliminate the Religious through evolution and science funding, which allows for development of science which leads to GDP
@aditya_asawa it is possible through policy to slowly make a group which is exactly counter to your goal to go away through societal engineering
@aditya_asawa You will lose if you don't have a healthy and well-educated populace. The game is all about balancing interest groups

@MattBruenig shouldn't we look at the impact of taxes on gini coefficients instead of overall gini coefficients in our research?

@TheYoungTurks 54% of discretionary. Excludes social security, Medicare, and Medicaid which are huge portions of mandatory spending.
@MattBruenig @TommSciortino @bygeorgist @mattyglesias I didn't realize the difference between VAT and sales taxes... I should have known that. Quite embarrassing. how does VAT compare to income?

@MattBruenig @TommSciortino @bygeorgist @mattyglesias Than it almost doesn't matter what tax we do because any tax will take more dollars from the rich than the poor. Think about relative impact
@TommSciortino @jitterbug212 @bygeorgist @MattBruenig @mattyglesias Cool graph. Thanks for the definitions.
@TommSciortino @jitterbug212 @bygeorgist @MattBruenig @mattyglesias I wish your variables were defined in your model... just being nit picky. I assume p is % poor and r is tax rate.
@TommSciortino @jitterbug212 @bygeorgist @MattBruenig @mattyglesias beautiful graph. Assuming progressive spending is more disproportionate than regressive taxation this will be true. Which it usually is.
@TommSciortino @bygeorgist @JudgeNathan @mattyglesias @MattBruenig In fact, the surge in demand for housing should encourage more investment, assuming no major legal barriers.
@TommSciortino @bygeorgist @MattBruenig @mattyglesias Combining progressive taxation with progressive spending would obviously be better at reducing inequality.
