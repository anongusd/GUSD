@Lawrence Excellent show tonight, Lawrence. The ending was memorable and apt. I, too, hope the Democratic candidate will use 'Trump Socialism'. As sure as tomorrow is Saturday, he will use socialism when he feels he's losing. That's when the candidate strikes! Take care.
@SteveKornacki anyone but Sanders. Preferably, Joe Biden. It would've been nice to hear you be a little more objective and not subjective when it comes to Sanders!
@SteveKornacki It's clear you are a Bernie Sanders supporter. However, you failed to mentioning your analysis the Hillary Clinton voters who will never vote for Sanders. This will make a huge difference in major states. His supporters gave us Trump. Her supporters will give us
@BarbMcQuade At what point is enough, enough? The cumulative effect reaches a point when? When is this criminal in the White House ever held accountable? Chuck seemed relieved when you and others let Trump off the hook. I just hope a Democratic President gets this benefit.
@PLEchevarria Why don't you hosts ever ask the relevant questions? Ex: When the man asked where the money was coming from to afford the programs on the left? You could've replied: "Do you know where the two trillion dollars came from for the tax cuts Republicans passed? Ask it!
@MickMulvaneyOMB Wow! Just heard a part if a speech you gave in 2015 about sending a message to President Obama about the 'imperial presidency'. Again, wow! The hypocrisy is stunning, but those with no conscience or integrity would care about past words. You're pathetic, Mick!
@RepPeteKing You're pathetic, Peter King. Completely pathetic!
@RepPeteKing You are as corrupt as the day is long. Your party is weak. The so-called men in your party are feminine, compared to Trump and his foolish audaciousness. You come on TV and grin and smirk about how Trump didn't know things, constantly making yourself look odorous!
@FoxNewsSunday You did a great job today interviewing Rush. We know he's full of himself, because he has Trump on a short string. The phony gestures of denial were just too much to take. Agree? Anyway, you have your good days Chris, and this was one of them. Good.
@matthewjdowd Why aren't you the guest host for 'this Week'? You were the only one on that panel that has common sense. And that includes the host, of course. Thank you!
@ptmacp @TheRickWilson Amen!!
@theousherwood You sit there with Nigel grinning about an accidental Brexit. This will blow up in your face and Nigel`s face too!
@SRuhle It's treated equally not equal. Treated is the verb. Only adverbs describe verbs. Answer the question: How was he treated? He was treated equally. That's all. Thanks!
@KatmanzuDarin @RepJeffries An indepth investigation on where this money comes from is necessary!
@DennyGranger @RepJeffries You, Denny, are a right-wing, sociopath! Recognize greatness, idiot. Mr. Jefferies is greatness.
@KatmanzuDarin @RepJeffries I believe it. Very intuitive!
@CLewandowski_ If Trump uses the emergency action, the future Democratic President will use it too. Don't whine and pitch a hissy fit when it happens! You are a disgrace after everything you've witnessed Trump do, and you continue to make excuses for him. You are a total waste!!
@VDHanson Your advice to Martha will fail. You have a feminized Republican Party, and a leader with no self-control. People like you believe you can help Republicans, but you can't. They are going the way of the dinosaur!
@ForecasterEnten Thank you for using Democratic primary voters. Much appreciated!!
@LindseyGrahamSC I truly hope you you feel the same way about emergency executive action when a Democratic President does this. If you try to grandstand and rail against him, you'll have hell to pay!! That's a promise!!!
@BraultPat @SenSchumer We'll see once a Democratic President is in the White House if you support McConnell giving up funds to him so freely. I bet you don't! Hypocrite!!!
@JoshuaW10958336 @SenSchumer Give Mr. President his money cause he ain't bugging. You sound so unintelligent! Once there's a Democratic President and he/she wants McConnell to give up funds, I'm sure you'll be for it wholeheartedly. Right? Hypocrite!!
@JosephVThomas5 @SenSchumer Before you write in to chastise someone falsely, learn subject-verb agreement. 'you and Speaker Pelosi are' not is. An idiot is as an idiot does!
@chupacabralight @SenSchumer Jason, you're an idiot!!!
@sissynav @SenSchumer Yes, and Mexico will pay for it!  You idiot!!!
@plyicehcky247 @SenSchumer @DNC Shut up!!!
@EdLindsay @SenSchumer Yes, he does! And hypocrites like you will pay a heavy price for giving this lying, cheating, disgustingly ignorant man in the White House a pass on all the God-dishonoring things he has already done. So, shut your mouth about Chuck, and focus on Trump. Too hypocritical!!!
@catretire1 @SenSchumer The majority of Americans aren't asking for a wall, idiot!!! That's what's wrong, fool!!!
@jjord1 @SenSchumer Clearly, he's speaking about what he knows thus far. He knows the basic outlines of the agreement. The more granular details will be studied later. Perfectly fine.
@HeidiHeitkamp Saw you on Lawrence's show tonight. You were great! He's right. You are a woman of integrity and the people of North Dakota will pay a terrible price with that fraud they elected. Take this advice.. Let your eye not feel sorry for them for they knew beforehand!
@keithboykin Understand the type of person you're debating. He's a friend of Trump's. Confuse the people and weave yourself out from beneath the knife's edge. Don't fall for it the next time you're on with that racist!
@keithboykin You mean well, and we know this. Scott is a hypocritical SOB! What he did was try to muddy the waters on this issue. Don't fall for his machinations. As you were ending the segment, he started grinning that ugly grin he does. He was happy to muddy things.
@RepTomGraves You're not getting 5.7 billion, so get a clue. Your President is a fool, and the entire world knows it. Spend more time trying to reign the idiot in than pursuing nonsense endeavors like border walls, Mexico was supposed to pay for. Remember that, Tom Graves?!!!!
@patrickhealynyt It's crystal clear you took Poppy Harlow's bait. You know Nancy Pelosi will not any votes on abolishing ICE. She said that to hurt Democrats. You could've pushed the fact that Democrats are trying to work with Republicans and they are only looking for an issue.
@TiffanyDCross I totally agree, MSNBC! Tiffany should have a show. I would definitely watch. She's no nonsense, and that's what's needed today. She has earned the right to have a show!
@JoyAnnReid performance. You had an opportunity to get answers or show, unequivocally, that Shultz's really has no real answers to the tough issues we face.
@JoyAnnReid plan as to what he was promoting since he was dead set against the Democrats version. If you really listened to Bill, he spoke just like Democrats in using specific jargon about medicare and wealth tax. You didn't pick up on that. Very disappointed with today's
@JoyAnnReid these vital programs. He weaseled his way out of specifics and on to generalalities. You got caught up in 'billionaire'. This was nonsense! At this point, if he wants to run, he should have specific plans to speak about. It was your job to ask for a point-by-point
@JoyAnnReid Your cockiness was the death of you in the segment with Bill Burton. You asked about two things that he artfully got out of answering. The first was the wealth tax and the second was medicare for all. You didn't allow him to give Shultz's plans, specific plans for
@GStephanopoulos Why is you have what's-his-face on with Dan today? He is a traitor to everything decent. Please, George, don't invite him back. I respect you, highly, and I enjoy your show. That man is pathetic, and he lies just like Trump. Thanks!
@SenJohnHoeven You are a hypocrite! You don't hold Trump accountable for Mexico paying for the wall, and I promise,  if Trump uses the national emergency, a Democratic President will do the same. Republicans  better keep their mouths closed or they will have hell to pay!!!
@ErinBurnett pour over Democrats plans for the country while running for the presidency. I never heard such a thing in Trump! Hillary's plans were completely ignored. The media set up a camera on an open podium waiting for Trump. Double Standard, indeed!
@ErinBurnett Too many investigations. Really. How many media personalities asked, "Are the Republicans overreaching?" I don't ever recall this being asked of people appearing on a variety of shows. Republicans seem to get away with everything. Just like media saying they will
@KrochetxKorner @guanadu @krassenstein No, sorry, it isn't. We have become accustomed to using 'I'. In reality, we have butchered our own language with repeated false customs.
@guanadu @krassenstein Absolutely!!!
@SenWarren Haven't you learned anything from Hillary Clinton? Whenever the subject of emails came up, she was out there on camera or in a statement apologizing. This hurt her severely. You've addressed the issue of heritage. Leave it! If you go down this road, it won't end well.
@guycecil @TiffanyDCross Right!!!
@7sTruth @TiffanyDCross Amen!!!
@heyward1971 @TiffanyDCross Exactly!!!
@kasie How could you sit there like a bump on a log and not ask Dan the question, "How did President Obama Tue your hands? Since you seen it yourself." He sat there and made every excuse he could for Trump. Who really challenged him? I had many questions. None were asked. Sad.
@andersoncooper sure in judgement of Ralph this night. If your producers believed Steve should've been their so badly, a question of hypocrisy should've come up. He was not asked about his unwavering support of Trump. This segment was truly sad for a variety of reasons.
@andersoncooper To have Steve Cortez on your show commenting about Ralph was a complete travesty! The sheer number of times this very man made excuses for the pure racism exhibited by Trump is extraordinary. I am surprised and disappointed in you! Steve did not earn the right to
@canadian_cousin Sorry for your loss. God bless.
@DebiAlexander3 @SenSchumer No! He's telling the truth, again. It's your president who lies. Remember that!
@mkraju we should protests! How could you possibly push scrutinizing Dems. when you didn't do this for Trump. A true double standard!!!
@mkraju I find it amazing how the media wants to scrutinize the Democrats' plans, but had no interests in scrutinizing Trump! And Hillary had many plans that the media thought was boring. How hypocritical! The media makes me sick. If they even dare take the Dems. over the coals
@secupp The worst thing that can happen to you- and other Republicans, as this election process heats up is for Howard to refuse to run. Wow! What a let down that would be. You simply couldn't contain your joy while listening to Gov. Chaffey. Almost going to pop! He won't run.
@SecretaryCard You call on the governor of Virginia to resign, but stop short of calling on Steve King to leave the House  of Representatives. This is exactly why you Republicans hypocrites should just shut up!!!! You have absolutely no legs to stand on in this situation.
@RobbyMook You weren't assertive enough when dealing with Jack Kingston. For one, no one corrected him when he said Democrat instead of Democratic. He inserted himself into whatever conversation he chose. No pushback! Wow! What could've been had Hillary chosen differently.
@AJentleson @joncoopertweets We didn't really need a picture to truly know how he feels, now, did we?
@KamalaHarris @leahkrevit Great agenda item, Kamala!
@MrDane1982 Amen!!!
@joncoopertweets From your Twitter account to God's ears!
@FoxNewsSunday Why are you asking this question about Northam and not Trump?
@lauferlaw @joncoopertweets Won't happen! They have absolutely no integrity!!
@OhNoSheTwitnt @leahkrevit Amen!!!
@MarkHarrisNYC @leahkrevit Republicans have no integrity! That's why it took so long.
@joelockhart @matthewjdowd Republicans have not integrity. That's why they can comment on the governor and disregard Trump. They're hypocrites!!!
@siano2020 You're absolutely wonderful, Sergio!!! Godspeed.
@MrDane1982 Mr. Weeks is right on the money again!!!
@matthewjdowd @NikkiHaley Complete hypocrite, Matthew! Nikki Haley and all the other Republicans say nothing to Trump but fall all over themselves to castigate the governor. I'm really sick of Republicans!!!!!
@NikkiHaley No one asked your opinion!
@smerconish You're appalled with the response to Howard getting into the race. Yeah, right! You're about as appalled as a woof is when surrounded by hens! You want this man in to split the Democratic vote and help Trump. You're a Republican with an agenda. Anything to help Trump!
@matthewjdowd The man who always has the voice of clarity! What was the response? As if we don't know. Thank you!!!
@JuddLegum Russian bots!  Don't fall for this. Most blacks are supporting Biden now!!!
@brikeilarcnn I'm very impressed with you and your show today. Keep up the good work! I'll watch every day that I'm off. Enjoy your afternoon. You've earned it!
@DerekStaahl In your news segment, you didn't play a clip of the woman who said Howard would be a Ralph Nader. In order for people to really understand why many are upset about this potential or probable run by Howard, simply mention Ralph Nader. This should've been shown.
@NPRinskeep is all about saving his billions from tax. You asked him about the inequalities and problems with tax, etc.  He had no answers. Why didn't you insist that he answer in detail?!
@NPRinskeep What is Comprehensive Tax Reform? We never got an answer. He immediately pivoted to Elizabeth Warren. No real push back. There were no substantive answers on anything. This interview told us nothing about what he would do specifically on anything. This supposed run
@AP Sorry to hear that!!!
@KamalaHarris Just a reminder...Truly sit down and examine what you believe in. Lose some of the cockiness. When asked a question, get to the point. People want answers not rhetorical nonsense. Thoroughly explain your policy position(s) when applicable. And above all else...
@SenBobCasey over border wall (concrete)  vs steel slats. Just be cautious about where you go, Bob. Show some forethought!! God knows, others who support you are watching!
@SenBobCasey Again. If you're not prepared for the predictable questions that will come from a particular network, don't go on. It seems many still haven't learned that basic lesson, and they've been in politics forever! The Fox News host thoroughly enjoyed having you wriggle
@matthewjdowd Matthew, you always impress!! I truly enjoy listening to your words of wisdom. Thanks!!
@RepAdamSchiff Why on Earth can't you tell Republicans they have until Friday to name and seat their members. After Friday, the Democrats will vote to send the documents to the FBI on Tuesday of the following week. It's time to be the Chairman of the House Intel Cmte.!!
@ron_fournier You're not original. The slap on the back to Chuck Todd today was noticed. You both are absolutely gitty about Schultz running. You both love the fact that Democrats are upset. And your 'Let everyone run. Why are Democrats afraid of competition?' Really.
@tombrokaw Tom needs to go into retirement quietly and quickly. When I heard his remarks, they hit me like a ton of bricks! He sounded just like a MAGA Trump voter. Pathetic!!!
@MrDane1982 @tombrokaw Amen. You seem to always have your finger on the pulse of any political argument. Good job, Mr. Weeks!!
@somanyshrimp Shut up!!!
@NickTroiano What is wrong with you?!  If this man takes one vote away from the Democratic Party, it's Trump back in the White House. Is that what you want?
@kpie_kem @MrDane1982 @mtaylor9758 Bernie folks insist Hillary people get over it and back Sanders. They have the audacity to insist that if Hillary people and others don't back Sanders, they will cause mischief and other outlandish behaviors. Well, they can act like the hooligans they are. No Sanders! Period!
@MrDane1982 You are in my prayers, Mr. Weeks. Love to you, always, my friend.
@ForecasterEnten Please stop using Democrat as an adjective. This drives me absolutely insane. It's 'voting Democratic not voting Democrat'. Republicans do this to be disrespectful and show disdain. It's worst for true democrats to speak like this. Thanks!
@keithboykin Let's see how much coverage this gets on Fox News! They always bring up Chicago. Never the red states, where much of this activity actually occurs.
@chazatlas @amjoyshow @MalcolmNance You got it!
@JoshuaCypess @JohnJHarwood Totally agree!!!!!!
@MrDane1982 He doesn't have to explain anything to me. Just don't run!!!  Stay a Senator!
@AlexClaySays We don't want Bernie Sanders to run!!!  Let him stay in Vermont as its Senator. He could do a lot of good there.
@AlexClaySays He's not the favorite!!!
@ashleyferraroo Hell no!!!!!!!!
@CaccioppoliMike We don't want Bernie Sanders!!!
@CLRsister Why are you supporting this man?  He gave us Trump!!
@mmpadellan You're right, Brooklyn Dad. Those people are fanatics!  They ruined Clinton's chances, and now they want her voters to back him. Not going to happen! Ever!!!
@MrDane1982 Thank you, Mr. Weeks!!
@MrDane1982 Go away, Bernie Sanders!! Go away!!!!!
@TiffanyDCross All right, Nancy!!!!
@Lawrence Haha haha haha haha 😂 😂
@JoshuaParkhurst @RepJeffries @HouseDemocrats Haha haha haha haha haha haha 😂 😂
@RepJeffries @HouseDemocrats Thank you!!
@RepJeffries @HouseDemocrats Thank you!
@DanaPerino Since you're for the emergency, when a Democratic President gets in office, he/she will declare an emergency on climate change and/or DACA. Not a word from you or your elk, please!! What's good for Trump is good for the next Democratic President. No hypocrisy!!
@ChristopherHahn by conservative hosts. Sad!
@ChristopherHahn you simply do basic research, you can have answers to these basic questions, should they be asked. It's the difference between an OK journalist and a great journalist. I still marvel at how much so-called Democratic strategists don't know when confronted
@ChristopherHahn This is exactly why smart hosts run rings around certain people on Fox. Do you know why the FBI didn't contact Stone before the raid? There was an explanation on TV. Mueller was afraid he would run or destroy evidence. Remember, he had an apartment in N.Y. If
@SkaneCanyon @RealTimers @AnnCoulter Haha haha haha haha haha 😂 😂
@Halcyon270 @RealTimers @AnnCoulter Tell us how you actually feel!
@Halcyon270 @RealTimers @AnnCoulter Wow!  Tell us you actually feel!  Haha 😂 😂
@KirstenPowers Great job on Anderson!  The Wall is a bridge too far. Excellently stated. Have a good 🌃.
@HarleyRouda Thank you for holding strongly. Please convey to the others that we are very proud of all of you! We appreciate you and will work hard to make sure you're reelected. Thanks again!!
@JohnKellar13 @SenSchumer Shut up, you idiot!!!
@Betty38592480 @SenSchumer Shut up, you idiot!!!
@Acosta Hi, I heard you were writing a book. Can't wait to read it!  Godspeed.
@BWilliams Thank you, Brian!!
@Lawrence Thank you, Lawrence!!
@maddow Thank you, Rachel!!
@CNNnewsroom The two bills are not the same and it would've been great to have the debate labeled correctly!
@CNNnewsroom @SenatorCardin Why are you CNN Newsroom classifying both bills as the same? They are totally different. One bill will try to exhort money from the American people for a wall Mexico was supposed to pay for, remember? The second bill will reopen government for everyone while negotiations
@SenatorCardin want your position protected and advanced, you must use some backbone along the way. I'm sure you understand what I mean. Keep up the good work! We believe in the Democrats!
@SenatorCardin If you were slated to start speaking after the vote, why didn't you assert your position? Cornyn knew this. He knew people would be tuned in right after the last vote. That's why he jumped in to start speaking. You've got to drop this Mr. Nice Guy routine. If you
@chrislhayes Check out Michael Bennet from Colorado on floor of Senate today! Please have on your show tonight. Thanks!
@BWilliams Check out Michael Bennet from Colorado on floor of Senate today! Please have on your show tonight. Thanks!
@Lawrence Check out Michael Bennet from Colorado on floor of Senate today. Please have in broadcast tonight! Thanks.
@maddow Check out Michael Bennet from Colorado on floor of Senate today! Please have in broadcast tonight. Thanks!
@RepCheri According to Scalise, you and others are caving to Trump on a wall. Really! After all of this. Shame!
@IvanGH @SenSchumer @realDonaldTrump No, you idiot!!!
@Jmlieber @RepJeffries @clarkm123 You're right!
@squashum @RepJeffries @HouseDemocrats Don't be a fool!  Ask your President to finally act like a President!
@SALIGATOR1000 @RepJeffries A complete idiot! Don't talk about reckless. This fool in the presidency is nuts!!!!
@rolandscahill Really? But he was a "Liberal" before 2016!
@keithboykin Amen!!!!
@TiffanyDCross @RepJeffries @realDonaldTrump He did and said nothing wrongly!! He told the truth.
@JohnJHarwood Thank you again, John!
@TiffanyDCross This is absolutely wrong. What makes this Trump Shutdown so understandable is that the pain is actually being experienced by folks personally! Real people are being evicted. Real people are going to bed hungry. Real people are being forced to work. Real people know who to blame.
@adamcbest Absolutely!!!!!
@keithboykin Thank you for your truth telling tonight on Erin's show. Mia knew you were telling the truth and had no response for why a 50 ft concrete wall is such a priority now and wasn't the last two years!! You're great!!!
@KatieHill4CA You're so great, Katie! We love you!!!
@SenSchumer Fox News is stating that the SOTU is on. Please tell me that's a lie!! No SOTU with the government closed! I know they lie, Chuck. No SOTU!!
@RickSantorum You are an abomination to humankind! I see you didn't mention Mexico this morning. Your defending Trump is the reason Republicans are so very hated by many!!!
@MrDane1982 Anyone that backed Bernie Sanders is a fool anyway!!
@CharlesMBlow What do you possibly expect from idiots?!
@AnthonyACLU Hey!  You did a fantastic job on Rachel's show tonight. Keep up the good work. You're great, and don't ever let anyone else tell you otherwise!! Have a good 🌃.
@CharlesMBlow Thank you for tonight on Anderson Cooper! Have a great 🌃.
@SymoneDSanders Well done! Open the Government!!! Enough said.
@KatyTurNBC believe Trump has any feelings is totally unfair!! Ask Trump how long it will last!!! You're terrible! Don't expect Democrats to cave. It's not fair, Katy!! You're better than that, but who knows!!!
@KatyTurNBC We know you're a true bleeding heart, but don't lose focus if who is to blame for this crisis. You want Democrats to cave because Trump is too petty to break. Go to the White House and tell Trump these things!  Trying to box in Democrats because you don't
@AymanM Democrats are explaining to you that they passed many bills to the Senate for passage. Why are you not questioning why Republicans won't pass the bills sent to them? You have truly dissapointed me. I get up early to watch you and Yasmen. I'll watch CNN from now on.
@Shawna Oh, come on, Shawna. It's Democratic not Democrat. How do we expect others to use the correct adjective when describing the party when members use nouns as descriptors? Practice using Democratic Party not Democrat party. This drives me absolutely insane.
@davebriggstv You stay strong. I watch this channel every morning to support you and Christine. I believe you are good people and truly care for the downtrodden. To me, that means everything!! Have a great morning, and don't ever, ever change. That's what makes you great!
@davebriggstv You are a great journalist, Dave! Don't ever, ever lose that fire and zeal for the truth and justice missing for minorities and/or others in lowly positions. Laura is a Republican, it seems. If not, it's quite clear she's an introvert and chooses not to interact.
@MiKeUltra6 @TiffanyDCross @NRA Wow!  Anything to seem relevant. Really, with the name.
@TiffanyDCross @NRA Wow! That's telling her, Ms. Wonderful!
@CouncilmanMoody @SenSchumer @realDonaldTrump You're an idiot! Trump is controlled by Rush and his far radical, racist, bigoted, right wing crew! Ann has already come out with her whip against Trump!  Completely hopeless and ineffective fool in the White House. A complete tragedy for America.
@elainaplott reporting? You're absolutely horrible! And its reporters like you, that give Republicans their get out of jail free cards!!!!!
@elainaplott How dare you go on TV and say the problem is with Democrats if they don't respond to Republicans! Have you been watching this debate? It was Trump who took these measures away and want to give them back as a concession! Where is you sense of right and wrong in your
@matthewjdowd Your appearance on 'this week' was extraordinary! You speak like a man who has been in the Democratic Party for years! I am very impressed and ask that you continue to tell the truth and hold everyone, in the wrong, rightfully, responsible for their deeds. Thanks!
@FoxNewsSunday Great interview with Pence! Making members of this Administration tell truth is like trying to pull two rear teeth, at the same time, while riding in a mobil home, on a semi-bumpy back road, going 70 miles per. hr. Unbelievable!!!
@JohnJHarwood Thank you, John! The truth, finally!!!
@BasilSmikleJr Why? Why are you speaking to S.E. Cupp about this Trump shutdown being blamed on the Democrats? I'm truly surprised at you Basil. Instead of pointing to the real issues of Trump's bait-n-switch today, you agreed with one of the most savvy Republicans on TV. Sad!
@AnaCabrera What will you say next time? Democrats should give in against? I know you care about the people involved, but you're doing what Republicans want. You're using their talking points. He's the problem,Ana!!!
@AnaCabrera What is wrong with you?  Zoe spoke to you about where the Democrats stand, and you were pushing in Trump's favor. This shutdown is Trump's fault. You want Democrats to cave and give in to a bully!  They won't be bullied into caving. He will do this again, Ana!
@ArthelNeville Next time, be proactive and ask the question. Thanks!
@ArthelNeville "What happens if Ann Coulter and the other right wing people are against this? Does he stand by the offer? Put the spotlight back on him. These people know Trump is screwed, and they will do anything to have public opinion turn on Democrats. Take that from them!
@ArthelNeville Why didn't you ask John from the Hoover Institute about Ann Coulter saying that Trump is offering amnesty? How does he think Democrats will be divided when the far right are already blasting his proposal online?! You may not have known, but a good question like
@theabstoddard No, the Democrats will not take his offer. Stop pushing for them to commit suicide with the base. This is Trump's fault, and you should be pushing that narrative. This mess is his fault!
@SenSchumer Force people like the hypocrite L. Graham and others to confront using Dreamers and others as pawn.
@SenSchumer American people...arent you tired of Republicans using Dreamers as pawnshop? Aren't you upset that Republicans regard their status here as nothing!  Make the argument!
@SenSchumer It's cruel for Republicans to always put Dreamers and others on the table like they're second class citizens! Notice, whenever there Sivan issue, they run to putting Dreamers on the table. Dreamers and others should be very offended! Make the argument!
@SenSchumer Make this argument...why are we putting Dreamers and others on the table as bargaining chips?  These people should have automatic status just because they have been bought here by no fault of their own. They know no other place. Make the argument.
@BrianToddCNN Enjoyed your segment, up until the very end. It's not the Democratic base that will ask Pelosi to give up. It is hard for many, but she is right in standing up to this bully. It would be nice if reporters like yourself put the blame where it belongs...on Trump!!
@matthewamiller @maggieNYT Well said!!!
@jahimes You chose wisely, Jim. Interviewing with a pro, makes you look smart. Keep up the good work!!
@JessicaTarlov Why don't you ever do resesrch? Nancy didn't go to Puerto Rico. She stayed in DC. Why didn't you know this? When she was in Hawaii, Paul Ryan was the Speaker. I'm not on TV and I know things that would shut the mouths of your colleagues! Do Research! And talk!!!
@HarleyRouda You are great!!! I saw your interview on MSNBC. Please tell all the others that the country is behind you. Don't give up! It's hard but we support you!!!  Thank you!!!!!!!
@FoxNewsSunday Oh, Chris, how did the staff go this morning? "Oh, well, he's done something else stupid." "What are we supposed to do now?" "Go out and support him! My, God, why?" "He is the head of the party." "I truly hope he gets a challenge!" "Don't be so loud." "Oh, God."
@hogangidley45 You know Nancy wasn't Speaker when she was in Hawaii. Paul Ryan was Speaker. Sophomoric is the response! You never answered the question. Did he tell Michael to lie?
@SwampyTrump Extremely!!!
@eclecticbrotha No Bernie Sanders!!!!
@RichardGoodste1 Why didn't you call Amy to the carpet when she stated Nancy was in Hawaii when the shutdown was happening? You should've injected that Nancy wasn't the Speaker yet! Paul Ryan was still the Speaker! Why don't you have an ear to hear things and react on contact?
@seanspicer The SOTU is off!!!! Get over it!!!!!!!
@AriMelber You call what Pelosi did petty and invite Robert Torecelli on. Terrible, Ari. Absolutely terrible!
@jaketapper McConnell! That's what a good journalist would do. He's to blame for bills not passing onto Trump. But do you stress this?! No! You turn everything on Democrats. You are repulsive!!!
@jaketapper What are Democrats going to give and don't say Trump has to give!" Are you insane?! You're a terrible journalist and many know it. Your turning to a panelist to ask what Democrats will do when you know McConnell refuses to call bills to the floor is repulsive! Ride
@mschlapp The representative is Rep. H. Jefferies from NY. Read his twitter account from yesterday.
@mschlapp Please read Rep. A. Jefferies tweet. It sums up where the Democratic Party is now!! Bye!
@mschlapp There will be no SOTU address this year! You and Martha can huff and puff all you want, but there will be no SOTU! This person in the White House and Mitch McConnell have destroyed norms. Nancy is entitled to one, too. Don't you think?
@JonLemire up to end just this way. So, don't ask this question! What will Trump do to stop the shutdown? That's the question you should focus on.
@JonLemire will claim a win here. But Democrats can take comfort in knowing that they helped people." You wouldn't feel good delivering this but you'll say it nonetheless. You may condemn Republicans, but you would say the Trump won. By asking her this question, you set things
@JonLemire about people." You, of course, would join in saying, "The Democrats care more about the people. That's why they made this decision. The vase won't like it. They will be furious, but people will go back to work. Hopefully, they will get credit for that. Republicans
@JonLemire How could you possibly ask Rep. Lowey what Democrats were willing to give up?  This isn't their fault. If she had said, "We'll give him the 5.7 billion to open government." The conversation would be... "Why did the Democrats cave?" Then, it would evolve to "They care
@HillaryClinton You tried to warn people. Only a portion would listen. Now, everyone can see how truthful you were.
@chick_canon @ChrisCuomo Yes. Thank you. Actually, I was sitting here thinking about what I wrote and it came to me that it wasn't S.C. but S.E. As soon as I went to send Chris a correction, I see your tweet. Wow!  Thanks again!
@JohnJHarwood Liar to the end!
@tracegallagher What was so funny at the end of your segment with Shannon?  Were you laughing at the fact that McConnell refused to meet with two of his colleagues? There are people suffering and you think it's hilarious that the majority leader is refusing to deal with it. Sad!
@ChrisCuomo people more. Thanks!
@ChrisCuomo camera with a number of strange expressions on your face. Steve is a apologist liar and S.C. Cupp is very smart. She realizes more that liberals give her credit for actually. That's why I listen to every word and hold her accountable for them. Please, check these
@ChrisCuomo camera
@ChrisCuomo You allow a lot to go right pass you. All I see is your face making all types of contorted shapes, as the lies drip from Steve's lips. Very frustrating, Chris! I'm at home looking at the screen, wondering why you won't ask pertinent questions. You just look into the
@ChrisCuomo same tired line about Democrats being blamed in the future. That won't work in this instance because the public really know what this issue is about, and they don't believe the Democratic Party is out to intentionally hurt them. Of course, you didn't challenge this.
@ChrisCuomo Why didn't you challenge him about the Dreamers? Why should they be put on the line...young people who already live here. Their future should be guaranteed. Why not raise the point? But you weren't thinking in this frame of mind. Pity!  S.C.Cupp has been pushing that
@RepJeffries Well done, Rep. Jeffries! Saw your interview on MSNBC!! Strong, bold, and incredibly courageous. Much appreciated!!!! Have a great 🌃.
@RodneyDavis Trump is wrong and you know it. Stop protecting Trump and tell the truth!
@Acosta Easily. He is or he isn't. This one is!
@OwenWG1976 @CDG_GTR @MarshallCohen Patience, Owen. All in due time, my friend. All in due time.
@SenSchumer the hypocritical words I heard coming out of Mitch McConnell today literally made me suck! This is the same man who vowed to scuttle everything President Obama proposed. And he's talking about Democrats obstructing! What a crock!!!!
@RepJoshG Why are you going up to the White House to become a pawn this person in the presidency can use as fodder? No wonder you canceled the MSNBC interview. I hope you cancel the White House engagement, too!!!
@maddow Good morning, please look into wash post story about T-Mobil checking onto Trump hotel one day after getting 20+billion dollar contract. Just a heads up! Thanks.
@MrDane1982 Agreed!
@babl1674 @Kevin_M67 @eegieweegie @SenSchumer @SpeakerPelosi All politicians lie. This isn't new. Allow me to ask you a question. Did you repeat President Obama's words of 'If you like your doctor, you can keep your doctor'? Personally, I knew some people wouldn't be able to keep their doctors if the system changed. Agree?
@MikieSherrill The next time you're asked if you support a wall or wall funding, you reply," I support reinforcing the border fence we already have. In areas where there is no fencing, I support technological advances, where appropriate."
@MikieSherrill Good job, tonight! Be strategic and bold. You were tonight. Thanks!
@BillNeelyNBC Why didn't you tell Ali that the MPs will vote to move Article 50! They wouldn't be required to leave on March 29th. The extension!!!!
@ChrisCuomo Why didn't you ask him where the transcripts and/or notes on the various meetings are? Simple.
@jonkarl  You had to know that telling George yesterday that the report would be anti-climatic would give Republicans fodder, and, yet, you said it anyway! There was nothing else that could be said at that time? Shooting yourself in the foot, constantly, seems to be on tap!
@babl1674 @Kevin_M67 @eegieweegie @SenSchumer @SpeakerPelosi I would believe every word you just stated if it weren't for the fact that Trump contradicts it. What was he heard saying in the private meeting with journalists? I really don't want to do this. It's never going to work. I'm only doing this because they're making me. Sad!!!
@mwills918 @SheldonBeatty @SenSchumer @realDonaldTrump This is rich! Coming from a couple who probably wanted to see President Obama's birth certificate. Shut up, you hypocrites!!
@SenSchumer @realDonaldTrump He's a callous, old man with no empathy!! Enough said.
@CillizzaCNN You're an idiot! Do you even know what you believe about Trump?!
@DrPaulKengor You're such a hypocrite! If you were honest during the conversation, you would've admitted that this behavior happens on both sides, but you're too intellectually dishonest to say what's actually true. You're a hypocrite! The both of you.
@DrPaulKengor Wow!!!  In all your talk about Republican presidents harassed by Democrats, you seemed to miss everything done to President Obama. I recall Mitch McConnell saying that he would make Obama a one term president! But you're too dishonest to tell your people this! Sad!
@krassenstein @MrDane1982 The liar!!!!
@JohnJHarwood Wonderful news!!!!
@ninaturner Your anger should be directed at Republicans in the Senate. Doug was happy you mentioned the House of Rep. The problem isn't the House. The Democrats passed numerous bills to reopen government. I'm disappointed that you didn't make the distinction.
@RepTedDeutch Excellent interview, Ted!! You're absolutely great!!! Keep up the good work!
@RepGaramendi Now that's how you do an interview! Excellent work!!!
@cornellbelcher How could you allow Cardenas to say both sides are to blame?  You could have immediately interjected there. Whenever some Republican says this it must be cut off right then!
@JohnJHarwood Yes, right. I'm totally an honest person. Never, ever lied to anyone, ever. Who says any differently?! I'm Donald J. Trump. I don't lie!
@SenSchumer @realDonaldTrump He's a total waste of time and space!
@JohnJHarwood Wow!!! Wonderfully said.
@SpanbergerVA07 Don't play the Republican game. You'll lose!!
@SpanbergerVA07 Instead of releasing tweets about how Democrats aren't for border security, please speak to people like Tim Kane, who will tell you how many bills Republicans voted against. This, you can take back to your voters privately! Use your brain. Be strategic, Abigail!!
@jahimes When you go on television with a fool, you end up looking stupid! Pick your moderators more carefully. Come on, Jim, choose more wisely!!!
@LindseyGrahamSC You are so full of it!  There was a deal struck between you and Trump. He gives you a reversal on Syria, and you give him your help on the wall funding! In reality, you could care less about a wall. You truly don't believe in a wall. You are a hypocrite!!!
@nowthisnews Wow!!!  Thank you, Sen.Tester!! That was intense and bold. You are a great Senator, and I am grateful to the good people of Montana for sending you back. Enjoy your weekend, sir!
@Acosta 	You are a great reporter, Jim. Don't ever lose that edge!! I'm following you now, and will continue to watch you on CNN. Enjoy you weekend!
@TiffanyDCross Will do, Ms. Wonderful!!
@kjoerwin @MrDane1982 Totally agree!!
@thebeatdc @RepJudyChu Thank you!!
@MrDane1982 You're a true patriot, Mr. Weeks!! I respect you a lot. Good job!
@DebsManagement @TiffanyDCross Yep!!!
@MrDane1982 I agree!!!
@ChrisVanHollen Absolutely!!
@AOC Extremely sad!!
@RachelRGonzalez Wow!!
@essenviews This man is an idiot, plain and simple!!!
@ardawk @TiffanyDCross Absolutely!!!
@RepScottPeters 	Excellent job on the Address, Scott!! 	Wonderful way of using your tone and body language to convey directness and boldness! Thank you! I'm following you now, sir. Enjoy your weekend. Thanks again!
@saladinahmed More patience is needed. Empathy is truly on the decline. Just look at the person in the White House!!!
@saladinahmed Wonderful!!!
@TiffanyDCross 	Thank you for confronting lies and establishing facts. You are a breath of fresh air!!! Seriously, hold classes to show others how to deal with fellow guests and media hosts. Please!
@RepGaramendi 	Please don't go back on TV without knowing what to say. You truly looked ridiculous on CAVUTO. No wall!!!
@KatieHill4CA 	Thank you, Katy!  Fox wanted you to betray your values, and you stood firm. She was absolutely shocked! Thank you for being brave and having moral courage. Have a great 🌃!!!! 😍
@MrDane1982 A man of few, but wise words!!!
@thehill @SenatorCardin The Trump Shutdown will kill people!!!
@jeffmeintzer @ChrisVanHollen NO!!!!!!!!!
@ChrisVanHollen You're doing all you can. We know it's Hypocritical McConnell and his motley crew that's holding up everything!!
@davidlj58 @ChrisVanHollen @SenatorCardin @SenateGOP @realDonaldTrump And don't start that utter crap about being against something because Trump is for it. I remember when President Obama proposed things the Republicans were for time and time again! But when President Obama was finally for them, they cried no way!!!!  Don't be a hypocrite!!!
@davidlj58 @ChrisVanHollen @SenatorCardin @SenateGOP @realDonaldTrump It's about principles! The US doesn't put up giant walls and say, "You're not welcome!" Boarder security is fine, but for Trump to use the wall that Mexico was supposed to pay for as a hammer to discriminate is unfathomable!!! Point blank.
@ChrisVanHollen @SenatorCardin @SenateGOP McConnell being shocked because of unprecedented procedures in this debate is like the fox being shocked that all of the hens have miraculously disappeared, and he's standing right in the middle of the hen house covered in feathers! As much as he breaks precedent!!!
@ChrisCoons 	Thank you for using 'Democratic house' and not Democrat house.
@JehJohnson 	You truly stepped in the, Jeh. You gave Chuck exactly what he wanted and that was equivalence of the two sides! There is no equivalence here.
@MaeP36659697 @ZealousBash @HillaryClinton @NYGovCuomo Are you sure you really want to go down that rabbit hole? Trump, the liar, deceiver, manipulator, conman, thief, criminal, philanderer, grifter, glutton, brash, cold, callus, calculating, impertinent, cruel, vain fool! Really, must I continue? There is more...
@JohnJHarwood I'm sure. They're really delusional!
@robreiner They give this fool air time, but they denied President Obama. They are afraid of what he will tweet about them. I said it before and I'll say it again... The bully has bullied the media successfully!!! They have be pushed into doing whatever he asks for out of fear of tweet!
@MrDane1982 He needs to go away!! He ruined Hillary's chances, and now he's threatening to step on the Democratic message tonight. This man is always on the wrong side of everything!!! Stay an Independent, and stay in Vermont as its senator. God, help us!!
@SenWhitehouse 	You are the man, Sheldon!!! A proud, dignified Democrat. Thank you!!!
@mikefarb1 @MrDane1982 A criminal!!!
@MrDane1982 Why? Go away Bernie Sanders!!! Why are you trying to step on the message of Nancy and Chuck?  Just go away!!!! Irritating!!!!!!!!!!
@MissNyetTrump You're right!!!
@SassyKadiK Absolutely!!! Make sure you blame him on social media, though!! Let everyone know how sick he's making you and the rest of the country. Yes!!!
@babl1674 @Kevin_M67 @eegieweegie @SenSchumer @SpeakerPelosi Reach out to me about how angry you are over Trump lying about who would pay for the wall!! Come on!! Show your claws!!!
@babl1674 @Kevin_M67 @eegieweegie @SenSchumer @SpeakerPelosi Democrats want basic Boarder security. Trump wants to fulfill a campaign promise! Shameful. And, still, he won't force Mexico to pay for it. Why aren't you upset over him lying to you and the other delusional supporters?! That's even more shameful. Sad!!
@HillaryClinton @JenniferBoysko Thanks!!!
@Seanall59190272 @SenSchumer @SpeakerPelosi Tell your president to keep his campaign promise to you and force Mexico to pay for the wall!!
@wothke @SenSchumer @SpeakerPelosi Tell your president to keep his campaign promise to you and force Mexico to pay for the wall!! Why won't you hold him accountable for his promise to you? You should turn the TV off when he starts speaking. Remember, he lied to you and all the other delusional supporters. Sad!!
@teresataw @SenSchumer @SpeakerPelosi Tell your president to keep his campaign promise to you and force Mexico to pay for it!!
@Djmc555D @SenSchumer @SpeakerPelosi No, actually it's still in Trump's. He's got to convince Mexico to finally pay for his campaign promise to you and his other delusional supporters!! You should make him honor his promise to you. Mexico should pay, because Americans won't!!
@RobertRayMyatt1 @SenSchumer @SpeakerPelosi Trump will only build this wall with Mexico money. No Americans will pony up funds to help with his campaign promise to you and his other delusional supporters!!!
@jkfluffa @SenSchumer @SenateDems @SpeakerPelosi You must be referring to Trump!! You must be pointing out to him that he must keep his campaign promise to you and force Mexico to pay for it!! Your comment is directly aimed at Trump, where it belongs!!
@PorkBullet @SenSchumer @SpeakerPelosi Trump is the problem! Tell Mexico to build your wall!  Tell your president to keep his campaign promise to you! Mexico should be able to get the wall built. Tell Trump to force them!!
@michele_161826 @SenSchumer @SpeakerPelosi Tell your president to keep his campaign promise to you! Force Mexico to pay for the wall!! Write him letters. Tell him to do what he promised you and his other supporters! Mexico should pay!!!
@ABarchers @SenSchumer @SpeakerPelosi Tell your president to keep his campaign promise to you and force Mexico to pay for it!! If it were a Democratic president, I'm sure you would insist that he keep his promise. Remember, you can keep your doctor! You held President Obama accountable, didn't you? Yep!!!
@Omarose33 @SenSchumer @SpeakerPelosi Democrats shouldn't give a dime for a wall Mexico was supposed to pay for, remember? I'm sure you recall your president promising Mexico would fit the bill. Why should tax players do it?  No wall!  If you want a wall, sign that crowdfunding petition going around. Fool!
@CjonesCar @SenSchumer @SpeakerPelosi @DNC Your president already said he was responsible for this shutdown!! Let's just leave it there, shall we?!
@weluvbama2 @SenSchumer @SpeakerPelosi Good, I hope someone you care about is affected by this shutdown. Maybe you'll listen next time your president decides to shut down government!! Pathetic!
@GailBritt16 @SenSchumer @SpeakerPelosi I can say the very same thing about Republicans. The moment President Obama was for something Republicans supported in the past, they were against it. Remember that?! So, don't use that tired, useless, gutless reasoning now!! No freaking wall!! Period!!
@cpmxxv @SenSchumer @SpeakerPelosi Go away!!!
@FelixCuevas18 @SenSchumer @SpeakerPelosi You're an idiot! Trump had shut down the government. He said he was responsible. I agree!!!
@Xoraktheoutcast @SenSchumer @SpeakerPelosi @realDonaldTrump Well, he sorta is the president of the shrinking, white male Republican party!!!
@Kevin_M67 @eegieweegie @SenSchumer @SpeakerPelosi No, it isn't. This man in the White House had made this political. No wall now! No wall ever!!
@jim_gauselman @SenSchumer @SpeakerPelosi No wall!!!!!
@SenSchumer @SpeakerPelosi What they said...
@ZealousBash @HillaryClinton @NYGovCuomo Go away and worship Trump with the rest of the mindless drones!!
@kb2izm @HillaryClinton @NYGovCuomo You're the criminal. Probably a Trump supporter. If that doesn't say criminal, I don't know what does!!
@nickiknowsnada @TAW3343 Thanks Nicki!!!
@adamcbest @Lee_in_Iowa Thanks Adam!!!
@phil_mckraken @EdwardARowe1 Thanks Phil!!
@JohnJHarwood 	Chris Cillizza is an apologetic fool! I also find him very annoying. The long, drawn out way he says things when just a few words would do. You're a man of practicality and forethought. Don't ever change!
@JohnJHarwood 	You are a breath of fresh air on television. I truly look forward to your segments. You don't hold back, and you tell the truth! I really appreciate your times on the different shows. Please make more appearances!! Good 🌃.
@fstuart2 @RepEspaillat Build a wall to keep Trump supporters out!!!!!
@dbongino 	No wonder the NYPD is so corrupt! People like you worked and still work there! Pathetic!!!
@fiascofray @RepEspaillat @USPS Sorry Fiasco, didn't understand the back story. I truly hope this situation is cleared up soon. Thank you for sharing.
@RepEspaillat @USPS Adriano will definitely look into this and rectify the situation! Give him time.
@kevincorke	I was changing channels and came across fox news while you were talking.I never figured a black man could be so ignorant as to truly believe you fit in at fox news. Make sure you don't pull an O.J. Simpson! Only then will you really know where you stand there.
If you can read this, you’ve helped me reach 10 followers. Thank you!
@RepSarbanes 	You are a credit to your father's name! Thank you so much for your sharp, confident wit on CNN. Victor tried to box you in, but you used reasonable facts to elevate the discussion. The 3rd District is fortunate to have you!! Have a great day, sir!
@soledadobrien He believes he's 👑! None of this is about him, he thinks!! He's a selfish man!
@TheRickWilson I love your wit, Rick! Don't ever change.
@RepAdamSchiff The very last one!
@EmoNegro1 @MrDane1982 You're an idiot!
@MikeyCanzonetta @JeanneGC67 @AidenWolfe You're right. Hillary tried to make this obvious and she was booed! I wish he would just go away permanently!!!!
@JeanneGC67 @AidenWolfe His candidacy will divide Democrats. He should not run. Many of Clinton's voters have not forgiven him for the chaos and selfishness he displayed! Never my vote!!
@AidenWolfe I totally agree! Bernie Sanders must stay out. I will never vote for him. You're absolutely correct in your analysis!
@RepSwalwell @daverjacobson Well said!!! Excellent analysis!
@Bornabrit1 These people do absolutely nothing! Why are they getting a raise?! Disgusting!
@keithboykin @MrDane1982 Ted is the worst!!! They're all hypocrite and don't care!!
@politico More lies!!!
@StillLes4Hill @voxdotcom Republicans are hypocrites anyway!!!
@dylanmsmitty Yep!!!!!
@MannyDeLosSanto @RepEspaillat @nmdcclub Absolutely!!!!
@maddow 	This is why you are at the top at MSNBC! 	You mentioned the Democrats' agenda! Chris led with a freshman woman using profanity. Thank you for being intuitive enough to know what true Democrats want to see. We love you, Rachel! Don't ever change!!! Keep telling stories!
@HallieJackson 	Now that's the type of journalism we expect from you! Your questions to Trump were spot on! You're a wonderful journalist, Hallie. It just angers me when you don't show it!  Thank you!!!
@RepMcGovern 	Please don't say 'Democrat Committee'. If you want others to used the correct termenology, you must use it. It's an adjective not noun. Democratic Committee. Thanks, Jim!  You are a democrat. You are apart of the Democratic Party. See the difference?
@HallieJackson 	Huge disappointment!!!!!
@ArthurDelaneyHP Good! He did absolutely nothing to enhance it anyway.
@RepAdamSchiff What an idiot!!!
@xdelmar59 @MrDane1982 Should have spent more time on these charges and less on the hateful charges he made against Hillary!! He will never get the nomination. If he does, the Democratic Party is doomed!!!
@maziehirono @PattyMurray We love you Mazie!!!
@CNN Americans caring about and helping other Americans. A concept Republicans know absolutely nothing about!!
@RawStory He lies all the time. Nothing new under the sun!
@davidaxelrod 	You're an idiot! Scott caught you off guard. What you should've said is..."The Republican base won't allow it. Any path to citizenship will be rejected by the far right. Trump will cave, so first convince the far right. I doubt you could do it." That was your way!
@JohnBerman 	You must stop wearing your feelings on your face. The fear you express is annoying! The Democrats will do just fine. A video won't stop them from their mission. Stop being deathly afraid of what Republicans, like hour co-host, think. Confidence, John. Please!!
@RepJeffries 	In the words of Woopie Goldberg when she played Mrs. Evers... "Now, that was a thing of beauty." No fanfare or fuss, just a sense of pride. Thank you, Mr. Jeffries. 	Very impressive!!
@JRubinBlogger 	Thank you for everything you said tonight on Chris's show!! Excellent!
@ChrisJansing 	You forgot a moniker...bedwetter! Why are you so afraid of what Republicans say? Grow a backbone. Nancy will act in the best interest of her party. Stop freaking out over an interview! Stop, Chris!!!
@SenSchumer Thanks Chuck!!!
@TeamCavuto 	Where was all this conversation for the debt when Republicans were pushing a 2 trillion dollar tax cut! Please spare us the holier than thou speech, which is really designed to cut social security and medicare. Hypocrisy, thy name is Neil CAVUTO!!
@GarrettHaake 	Now, that's good reporting with integrity. Telling the truth and getting out the facts is excellent journalism. Thank you!!
@MaxRose4NY 	Thank you, Max!!! I see your passion and love for the district that elected you and the American people!! This isn't a TV show!! You have so much support!! Thanks again!!
@DEEPEEZYISHERE Pray to Jehovah. He is the God of all comfort. Pray to him through Jesus Christ, his son. Ask him to give you the courage and strength to do the things you must to get well. He will hear you!
@mariegamalski @1timrik @SenSchumer @realDonaldTrump Totally agree!!!
@RobbyMook Send this to the various media outlets! These people will continue to follow Trump because they are afraid of him. The bully has bullied them thoroughly!
@daverjacobson 	You are wonderful!!! What a great job you did on CNN combating lies with facts!  Please show others- who come on television-how to speak the way you did. I'm following you now!!!! Thanks again!!!!
@RepEspaillat Thank you!!!!
@PlayOffense 	You are absolutely horrible! What type of Democrat are you? Nancy will never give a cent for an immoral wall! You never mentioned Trump's promise that Mexico would pay for it! What you're saying is fantasy and traitorous!! You belong on Fox! Stay there!!!!
@hollywturner 	You didn't mention that Mexico was supposed to pay for the wall, and the nerve of talking 'playing politics'. There is no bigger culprit than Trump!!! The wall is immoral. Nancy will not give in!!!
@MollyLineFNC 	In everything you stated about the wall, you missed... 'And who will pay for the wall?!  Mexico!  Who?!  Mexico!!" Just thought I'd remind you. Carry on!!
@GarrettHaake 	Why didn't you read 'Trump shutdown' when you read the Democratic text? Don't be afraid of not taking the side of right. Stop being neutral. Tell the truth when you report. Be a good reporter, Garrett. Every one is counting on you to tell it like it truly is!
@BlakemanB 	Whatever happened to Mexico paying for the wall?! The liar-n-chief can't even keep his word on the one crucial promise he made his stooges! Sad, but no wall funding!! Ever!!!
@TonyVMiami @SenSchumer @realDonaldTrump Like the Republicans who had both house for two years. Did you send them the same message? Democrats will legislate. It's the Republicans I fear won't do anything, as usual, of course!!
@harrygato @SenSchumer @realDonaldTrump No!!
@1timrik @SenSchumer @realDonaldTrump Monster McConnell!
@pbaratelli @SenSchumer @realDonaldTrump Another fool!
@1timrik @SenSchumer @realDonaldTrump No!!
@Negumbo3 @SenSchumer @realDonaldTrump @senatemajldr You're a brainwashed fool!  There will never be a wall!!  It doesn't work!  What part of that don't you understand?! And to be a black man in America. You should really be ashamed!
@MediaSniperNest @SenSchumer @realDonaldTrump Go away!!!
@bryan_radabaugh @SenSchumer @realDonaldTrump Term limits for Republicans!!!!
@KeithOlbermann 	You are the best! Still wish you were on MSNBC with Countdown!! ESPN is fortunate to have you!
@zachfriend55 How do you sit there and allow Dan to say Warren started off her campaign negatively? Remember the escalator and rapists and murderers? Why didn't you say something to rebuff that? What type of Democratic strategist are you? Just silent. Wow!!
@keithboykin Liar-n-chief!!! His gullible supporters should pay for it.
@RealDocSoos 	You call yourself a Democratic strategist!! Nan Hayworth went on and on about nonsense concerning Democrats, and you just sat there and smiled! Don't give up your day job. Stay off of television. It's not your venue.
@dee_white @HillaryClinton Idiots who text!!!
@LittleSavedGirl @HillaryClinton Only when Trump goes first!!!
@PattiSolisDoyle  When Erica asked if having a white man at the top of the ticket will be an issue? Well, you should've answered, "There was a poll out that said...more democrats want to win than share values. Of course you didn't know this. Please do research before appearing!
@DrVMDS 	You are a disappointment! Your cave was noted!!
@FrancesRivera 	Will you please stop wearing your frightened heart on your sleeve?! Stop being afraid of what Republicans say. You're too scared! Get some backbone and start asking questions like...whrn will you vote on your initial agenda? First day, still? Come on!!!!
@HallieJackson 	What is wrong with you?! Asking Hoyer about distractions by the White House. You know Trump is a liar. Please go back to reporting from the White House. Terrible!
@RepEspaillat 	Thank you for pointing out that the election solved this phony overreaching argument. Remember, that anchor is deathly afraid of what Republicans say. You handled the interview well. Keep pointing out that the Democrats have the momentum! The election proved it!
@NathanHRubin 	Why not confront the blonde when she spoke about Hillary and Trump?  She made it seem like Trump had detailed plans and Hillary didn't. You have to deal with lies when they occur! Otherwise, people become confused. Wake-up!
@ASweetJesus @HillaryClinton Much agreement, indeed!!
@JenniferLVC @shadaph @HillaryClinton So much agreement, Jennifer. So much agreement, indeed!
@steve12powers @HillaryClinton Thank you, Steve. Wonderfully said!
@MarkDice @HillaryClinton So do Warlocks, it seems!!
@RealDocSoos 	How could you not mention that during President Obama's time in office many of the things Republicans were for they miraculously became against when President Obama was interested in working together? When you come on television, you must be prepared. You weren't.
@admiralmpj Don't like Bernie Sanders at all. If he gets nominated, Democrats will lose!!! Beto for 2020!!!
@JordanTribe_ @HillaryClinton You're right! Trump is not my President!!!
@ChrisCoons 	Democratic not Democrat. If Democratic Senators and Representatives can't speak of themselves in the adjective and not noun, how can we expect others too?
#petedavidson	Please go to https://t.co/f73PGjO2Q7. Here is where you will find relief from the suffering you're feeling. Any question you have about life and hope for sicknesses ending can be found here. Listen to the various videos and read the material. May Jehovah bless you.
@WayneGoodwinNC 	No primary do-over. The Trump party knew that this man was cheating in their initial primary and totally ignored it! Do not allow for a new primary. Take it to court if necessary and argue that they had the opportunity to stop the fraud but didn't. Fight it!!!
@Malinowski 	You were wrong to tell Allyson that Ivanka's emails shouldn't be investigated. Democrats can walk and chew gum, too. Yes, her email use should be investigated!!
@MichelleSweari5 @chucktodd It shouldn't be shocking. Like disturbed minds think alike. Always remember that. His supporters are just as troubled and fanatic as he is. It's the Trump party, full of pathetic Trumpsters!!!!
@davebabler @RobbyMook The Russians have manipulated the voting machines. Bill Nelson spoke about this some time back. Scott did nothing!
@jejohnson322 	If you don't believe President Obama is enough to bring out the votes Democrats need, what's your answer?  Don't just make a statement like that and not give a solution. Where's your solution?!
@politico Wow! So many house slaves wearing and holding up Mega hats. Makes you just want to vomit!!!
@mikejenkins522 @RobertW36924779 @NancyPelosi Fool!!!!
@RobertW36924779 @NancyPelosi Yes!!!!!!
@rlparker47 @Neuro58 @NancyPelosi Another idiot!
@brycetache Thank you!!!!
@JayCology @Lee_in_Iowa Exactly!!!
@darrensands Do not go back on TV again!  You are absolutely horrible. Go back and watch your segments. No passion or expression...nothing!
@KarimeMasson1 @RobbyMook @arlingtondems Wonderful!!!!!
@cindyraecox_rae @RobbyMook @arlingtondems Wonderful!!!!!
@SenSchumer Thanks!!!!
@Lee_in_Iowa Voter suppression all the way. How can you let people know that their registrations are void one day before the deadline?  Take this to court!  Republicans are morally deficient people!
@Lee_in_Iowa Why has Texas rejected https://t.co/PafS10tRuw?
@BWilliams 	Brian,  whatever happened to the two women the FBI were going to interview last Friday night? You stated it in Breaking News. Find out if you can.
@johnpodesta @realDonaldTrump Absolutely!
@BarbMcQuade 	What is wrong with you?  This judge is biased. He's helping the defense. Why are you making excuses for his behavior? He signaled in the beginning that this case shouldn't have been brought. He's working for the President. Don't lose focus and tell truth!
@misterbumface @SenSchumer 	What is wrong with you?  What if your children were taken from you?  Would it be a trival matter?
@ChrisVanHollen @SenJeffMerkley 	Thanks!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
@HillaryClinton @GabbyGiffords @ShuttleCDRKelly 	Thank you!!!!!!!!!!
@SeymourHersh 	I just saw your Democracy Now interview from April 2016. You really weren't hot on Hillary. How about now? Saw Don's show.
@cathyob1 @PhilipRucker Thanks for posting this!  There should be no apology to Trump,  his daughter or any Trump supporters! Period!!!!
@realmyiq2xu2 @PhilipRucker Find CathyO. She has posted all the Trump supporters and their vile tee-shirts!!!
@realmyiq2xu2 @PhilipRucker Where are your photos from 2016?
@PhilipRucker Thank you, Phil! There should be no apology by SB. Tell Trump to send his tweet to his supporters!
@PhilipRucker 	Thank you, Phil!  I was pulling my hair out trying to get someone to mention the Trump people and bad tee-shirts. Thanks!
@angela_rye 	I saw you tonight. I wish you could've spoken about the many Trump supporters that had c**** on tee shirts to describe Hill.
@AndoNC @Jackfierleygma1 @HenryB1992 @HillaryClinton 	You are from your father the devil and you wish to do the works of your father.
@AndoNC @Jackfierleygma1 @HenryB1992 @HillaryClinton 	You are such an ignorant tool!
@HenryB1992 @Jackfierleygma1 @HillaryClinton 	Another idiot!
@GlenFletcher770 @Jackfierleygma1 @HillaryClinton 	What a fool!
@techmaster58 @DaveStylee 	No he isn't!
@HillaryClinton @maura_healey Thank you!!!!!!!
@KenDilanianNBC 	How could u possibly say the informant issue is more relevant than the Trump Jr. Issue?  Stop chasing the shiney objects!
@floyd_party_o_4 you go away and stay away!!!!

@GrahamDavidA 	Go back and look at yourself as you talk about Hillary's situation.
@GrahamDavidA 	Murder.
@GrahamDavidA 	Is turning a blind eye to many of the things trump does but they place the magnifying glass on Hillary.  He gets away with
@GrahamDavidA 	I'm not making anything up. Powell will vote for Hillary.  He will endorse her.  The President had it rightly. The media
@GrahamDavidA 	Your absolute joy at her downfall is what I take offense to.  That's it!
@BrookeBCNN 	Didn't either.  The way you cut your eyes at him.  I saw you.  I saw your look as Gloria spoke.  Despicable woman!
@BrookeBCNN 	Your hatred for Hillary is palpable. You and your buddy,  Jeff.  Clearly,  he didn't see what Trump did today as bad.  You
@GrahamDavidA 	He will vote and endorse her because he hates Trump.
@GrahamDavidA 	Clue.
@GrahamDavidA 	Will endorse her a little later. The way you smiled as you tore a hole into her.  You took great joy in that.  You have no
@GrahamDavidA 	What an idiot you are!  You just made a complete fool of yourself. Honestly,  Colin Powell has respect for Hillary.  He
@tvkatesnow 	You totally dropped the ball today.  The major story was the investigation  by my Attorney General.  You totally missed it!
@HallieJackson 	Understand why the media insists on hammering into for nonissues but allow Trump to say and get away with everything.
@HallieJackson 	Why was this action done?  An investigation is needed.  Trump and his people lie about everything. You know this.  I can't
@HallieJackson 	Done.  Wow!  The double standard!  Of course they say it's politically motivated. What else will they say?  The question is:
@HallieJackson 	What is your problem? You and your colleagues were all over Hillary about the Clinton Foundation, when no wrongdoing was
@davidgregory 	Give her credit for it!
@davidgregory 	Different standard. You are not comparing her to what is historic because she had already done what's historic! You didn't

@davidgregory 	Stop including her with him when you speak about him being private!  She has done a lot more and you and others lump her in
@davidgregory 	Why are you making an equivalency between Trump and Clinton?  She had turned over the normal amount of materials. He hasn't!
@SaraMurray 	You are very dishonest!
@SaraMurray 	Leaders for this position in the past.  You are very dishonest. The President  was right about people in the media like you.
@SaraMurray 	Stupid woman!  Why are you showing  an equivalency between Trump and Clinton?  Hillary has met the standard of all other
@donlemon 	On Trump.
@donlemon 	You are an idiot, Don.  You shoot down Hillary and laugh with Trump supporters. You didn't allow Angela to complete her thought
@kasie 	Wow!  Didn't mention anything about media not coming this election fairly.  Not a mention!
@kenvogel 	Into a corner? It's going back to making him answer on race and all of the other deplorable things he had said already.
@kenvogel 	You are a fool.  How can you reasonably believe that the Clinton campaign won't use the deplorable comment to paint Trump
@RobbyMook 	Where are the ads with Donald Trump  saying Economy better under Democrats?  Get on it!  Push it,  hard!
@ThomasARoberts 	Losing your mind.  To quote Lawrence O'Donald.  Get it together, Thomas,  Bernie lost.  The primary is over!
@ThomasARoberts 	Are you asking for Trump's medical records?  You really need to check your hatred for Hillary at the door.  You are
@meganmurp 	Hillary will soldier through this and win this election.  She will make you eat your disgusting words!
@meganmurp 	Your biased and cheap appearance on TV was truly noted by Clinton supporters. You're not journalist! You're a partisan.
@Lawrence 	Great job,  Lawrence! Well said tonight.  Very good!
@orach24463_cj @RobbyMook @HillaryClinton 	Take this garbage off the twitter screen.  Not true!
@RobbyMook 	Push Pence word today about him not denouncing David Duke as deplorable.  Tell everyone to push that tomorrow. Play video.
@BrookeBCNN 	What is wrong with you?  All of your segments are pushing for Donald Trump.  I knew you hated Hillary but this is crazy!
@drsanjaygupta 	You don't have enough information.  Who the hell are you?  Why does she have to answer to you?  You make me sick!
@brikeilarcnn 	Clinton people can see your joy!
@brikeilarcnn 	That picture fits you.  The stuck up queen of journalism.  You must be totally happy at what's happening to Hillary.
@BrookeBCNN 	He denounced David Duke?  You idiot!   Everyone knows he said that to quiet skeptics.
@BrookeBCNN 	You are deplorable. I wish you were this thorough with Donald Trump over pay for play with Pamela bondi. Do you really believe
@drsanjaygupta 	Keep doing Trump's work for him.  You will not get Hillary's records.  So, forget it!
@albamonica 	you don't need to know everything! You make allowances of Clinton supporters sick as hell,  with your complaining and whining!
@NeilTurner_ @HillaryClinton 	She was right.  You are deplorable!
@Run_IsHere @bmoschetti @drsanjaygupta @CNN 	Else.  This is not a big deal!
@Run_IsHere @bmoschetti @drsanjaygupta @CNN 	Sanjay is a fool.  He's making this into  something else. Poppy is making this into something
@bmoschetti @Run_IsHere @drsanjaygupta @CNN 	I am angry with Sanjay and Poppy!  They are making this into an issue. It's not an issue!
@drsanjaygupta 	Are pathetic!

@PoppyHarlowCNN 	And to think I actually wanted you to return. Wow! What a mistake that was.
@mj_lee 	Your report was very biased.  I'm surprised at you,  Mj.  I will not take you seriously ever again!
@danmericaCNN 	Mainstream conversation for you!  Not her supporters, you idiot!
@danmericaCNN 	Where is your Trump pay for play report?
@drsanjaygupta 	What is your problem? The doctor told you what happened.  Why can't you just accept that?
@JenniferJJacobs 	Happiness. You are despicable!
@JenniferJJacobs 	you are a terrible reporter and to gloat  about how Trump lost a day and will pick up,  is atrocious. The slight grin of
@danmericaCNN 	Are you going to report on Donald Trump's pay for play scandal with Pamela bondi?
@scottmclean 	Messages and so do you.  But for you and Martin to pretend that what Hillary said was beyond the pale is in itself laughable!
@scottmclean 	Going to say the things they said.  Even the last woman admitted to Trump's racists comments. They all know the hidden
@scottmclean 	Asking racists what they think about someone calling them out as racists won't be pretty,  you idiot!  Of course they are
@scottmclean 	Was speaking about you and Martin as well. I think she was,  and rightly so.  I  hope she keeps saying it!  The nerve of you
@scottmclean 	You and your buddy Martin deserve one another.  Seems like you fit in right at home at the values event.  Maybe Hillary
@JenGranholm 	Come on,  Jennifer.  Get in your game! Don't allow this to become an issue.
@JenGranholm 	Supporters feel that the altright is in line with how they view the country. I stand by what she said and it's true.
@JenGranholm 	You dropped the ball.  All you had to tell Alex was that What Hillary stated was correct. Based on data, most of Trump
@MartinSavidge 	Where is Fredricka?
@MartinSavidge 	Hatred for Hillary is palpable. But. I never watch any of your specials.  I truly believe you are not a good journalist.

@RobbyMook 	No more Clinton folks on Today with Matt lauer. Please.
@RobbyMook 	This issue?  Kick him to the curb.  Even after she wins in November. Let him know that he crossed the line.  Too partisan.
@RobbyMook 	He spent too much time on emails. Almost like he was trying to make a name for himself. How can out out do the Republicans on
@RobbyMook 	I would never sit down with Matt Lauer again!
@MLauer 	You ask him a question about Isis!  Totally dropped the ball.
@MLauer 	You totally dropped the ball with Trump.  If you ask him the question.." do you know more than the generals? " and he answers yes,
@MLauer 	Couldn't wait to talk about emails!
@AndrewNBCNews 	You have zero creditability! Good for nothing,  partisan.
@AndrewNBCNews 	What an idiot?! You write about a coughing fit when Donald Trump is involved in pay to play with Pamela Bondi from Florida.
@kurteichenwald 	Absolutely!
@SaraMurray 	I know why... Trump supporter.
@SaraMurray 	Your biased need piece didn't mention the pay for play with Pamela Bondi. I wonder why?  Absolutely no mention of it.
@PostRoz 	Still waiting!
@PostRoz 	Where is your article on Trump'S pay for play with Pamela Bondi? Where is the same excitement?
@washingtonpost 	Write it.  The same way you labeled Hillary as crooked.
@washingtonpost 	Where is it?  Where is the holier than thou editorials on why Donald hasn't come clean yet?  I really would like you to

@cenkuygur 	Your side never takes that into account when they state that Bernie's supporters are the ones who will refuse to vote for
@cenkuygur 	You should be ashamed of yourself! The prediction you stated was foolish.  Bernie would have lost a lot of Hillary votes.

@Dennis_QH3 @YoungBLKRepub 	Learn your history.
@Dennis_QH3 @YoungBLKRepub 	Do the research. Red States.  There is more welfare in the Midwestern and southern states than the coast states.
@Dennis_QH3 @YoungBLKRepub 	Did you know that there are more people on welfare in the red states? Red States not blue states.
@Dennis_QH3 @YoungBLKRepub 	The party of Trump is the party of slavery,  segregation. Like,  Jim Crow,  welfare,  and red state ghettoes.

@frates .	Senate,  the Democrats will have a new job for him: janitor!

@wlange2 	Hillary had millions of people who believe she is the future as well.  Our voices count!
@wlange2 	Sanders. Hillary won.  Tuesday was tell the world that.  Don't be a spoil-sport and disrupt the convention out of spite.
@wlange2 	For a socialist. But if he was in the lead and lead throughout the process, I would have no choice but to frown and vote
@wlange2 	Trouble to the convention.  I feel the exact way you do now.  I would hate to see Bernie get the nomination. I don't want to vote
@wlange2 	Your  anger and frustration are not needed at the convention. Bernie Sanders lost the primary fair and square. Don't bring

@SkinnerLiber8ed @SDzzz @thecattribe 	Don't be a part of the few.
@SkinnerLiber8ed @SDzzz @thecattribe 	Most people know Hillary did nothing wrong. Some are easily duped. A few will believe anything.
@SkinnerLiber8ed @SDzzz @thecattribe 	You know that,  you're fine.  Don't let Republicans get into your head.  They are insidious!

@SkinnerLiber8ed @SDzzz @thecattribe 	Hillary is very strong in a general.   She has cross-over appeal.  Bernie doesn't.

@JustGotEpic @MrDane1982 	Makes it that more difficult for Hillary to unite the party, but she will do it.
@JustGotEpic @MrDane1982 	Alive with false hope.  His people know the situation. It's shameful that many are being misled this awful way.
@JustGotEpic @MrDane1982 	Absolutely! I've been saying that since March, when he was mathematically eliminated. The news media keeps him

@MrDane1982 	She will.
@MrDane1982 	Good!  The more early vote, the better.  Sanders just doesn't know when to quit. She must beat that old goat decisively! And
@flwrpwr1969 @puppymnkey @TAW3343 	Bill and Hillary rocks!
@dansimoncnn 	Objective. We shall see.  I'll look for that report, Mr.  Simon.
@dansimoncnn 	Journalist, you would now go to her die-hard supporters and ask them questions about Sanders.  That's if you truly are
@dansimoncnn 	Have Sanders' supporters on makes Hillary look badly,  and I'm sure that's what you want.  But if you want to be an objective
@dansimoncnn 	Be objective.  Go to Clinton supporters next and ask them would they support a socialist. It's only fair.  To constantly
@dansimoncnn 	Now,  go to Clinton supporters and ask them how they feel about Bernie prolonging this race when he knows he can't win.
@JasonKander 	Good afternoon, I hope you are successful in your question to dethrone Blunt.  Keep fighting!  You can win!
@RepRaulGrijalva 	Unify the party.  Stop being a spoiled sport.  You lost! You lost back in March!  A socialist won't win a national
@RepRaulGrijalva 	You're another one whose trying to blow up the party. When Sanders loses California, Sanders needs to start helping to

@mitchellreports 	Everywhere and you said nothing.  It's really a shame this happened, but what else should Clinton supporters come to
@mitchellreports 	You didn't push back on anything.  Is your hatred for Hillary that profound?  This woman is out there spreading false hope
@mitchellreports 	The nominee. And the news outlets will call the race on Tuesday for Hillary because she will have met the requirements.
@mitchellreports 	Will be the nominee and you know that,  but you allowed her to go on and on in a fantasy question about Bernie being

@LATSeema 	You are an embarrassment. Surely,  you would know a lot about the subject!

@AGirl4Bernie @HillaryClinton @latimes @JerryBrownGov CNN	Another foolish Sanders' supporter.  A real idiot!
@amieparnes 	Recognition she had earned. What a shame.
@amieparnes 	This entire situation. she had the numbers and everything one needs to win,  but the media continues to deny her the
@amieparnes 	But of course you don't care.  You simply hate Hillary and you're probably praying she loses.  But that's the bad thing about
@amieparnes 	The base wanted everything for free.  Sanders wants to give them free things.  Hillary wants responsibility. What a difference!
@amieparnes 	Our hatred for Hillary is quite obvious.  You are such a terrible reporter. It means nothing if she doesn't win California.
@DylanByers 	Many contests before getting the nomination. It would be nice if you and others treated her like he was treated 8 yrs. Ago.
@DylanByers 	Treated.  She is always held to a different standard.  President Obama was never held to the same standards and he lost
@DylanByers 	Entire process Hillary has been expected to win everything. Even President Obama didn't and wasn't skewed the way she is being
@DylanByers 	Your words are completely wrong.  She will win California. New Jersey will put her over.  The problem is throughout this
@FredBen217 	You're family!  It's fine,  my friend. Welcome!
@Swerdlick 	Convey to them that there is no hope.  You all add to the confusion.
@Swerdlick 	There. And it's so-called journalist like you who continue to give Sanders and his supporters credence when you should
@Swerdlick 	The debate was a way of Sanders continuing to give his people hope.  They shouldn't have that hope because the numbers aren't
@Swerdlick 	To adopt. But they want everything their way,  and that's a problem.  They want what they want regardless of what can get done.
@Swerdlick 	World of Sanders is the only one who feels our pain.  They ate wrong.  Many of them policies Sanders has Clinton is prepared
@Swerdlick 	He doesn't need.  He's lost already. The problem is Sanders' supporters don't want to accept reality. They are trapped  in a

@Swerdlick 	You have no idea what you're talking about.  Clinton didn't miss an opportunity to debate Sanders.  She has the most votes.
@KaivanShroff @puppymnkey 	Good job!
@FredBen217 @puppymnkey 	Nice! I like this.  You did a great job here. Thanks!

@kwelkernbc 	Despite reporters like you and Chris!
@kwelkernbc 	"But first,  she's got to clinch the nomination, Chris," she says with utter disgust. She will have it after New Jersey.
@ShaunKing 	Fall. The party will declare Hillary the winner on June 7th and Sanders will be relegated to the trash heap of history!
@ShaunKing 	Your analysis is totally wrong!  The Democrats will not waste weeks struggling with a failed socialist, who can't win in the
@ShaunKing 	We will have a Democratic nominee on June 7th.  When New Jersey comes in,  Hillary will reach the required delegates she needs.
@eddiekurtz 	No upset.  Hillary will win California!
@eddiekurtz 	You are a fool!  Hillary will be the nominee. Get over it!
@meganliberman @lisabelkin 	Sanders supporters should use common sense and realize that they can't win!
@meganliberman @lisabelkin are
@meganliberman @lisabelkin 	We ate just pointing out facts.  This race is over and Sanders' supporters are not living in reality.
@lisabelkin 	I could care less.  But I would like to see more positive stories for Hillary.  There aren't many.
@lisabelkin 	Consideration for Hillary.  The only people who care about Sanders' ability to keep campaigning is a Sanders' supporter.
@lisabelkin 	Yahoo has been very biased in their coverage. This outfit has supported Bernie Sanders the entire time. There is no
@nbctracie 	Are! Ms. Potts!
@nbctracie 	Planning to match in a patriots parade. And twice as much good press for Sanders  in your report.  It's quite clear where you

@JohnAvlon 	I appreciate what you said about Hillary on CNN with Stelter and Jane. You were great in putting her situation into perspective.
@dawnsaffron @thecattribe @SDzzz @BJHare 	Hillary.
@dawnsaffron @thecattribe @SDzzz @BJHare 	What are you talking about? She has nothing to do with private prisons. You know nothing about
@foxpokerfox 	Adam rattled you today.  I've never seen you lose control. What happened?
@RepAdamSchiff 	I am so proud of you, Adam!  You were great today. You should teach a class on how to be an effective surrogate.

@FredBen217 	The tank for Sanders.  But Holly's people must remain steadfast and resolute! Victory is near!

@KatyTurNBC 	Like you continue talking about it,  it will remain an issue.  I wonder why you haven't asked why Sanders is still in the
@KatyTurNBC 	You must be very proud of yourself after saying that Hillary is still dealing with the email issue.  Well as long as people

@wjmcgurn 	Run the ads too.  Trump hasn't done anything special.  You're all Fools if you think he has.  Good luck!
@wjmcgurn 	You are an idiot!  What you said was crazy.  Donald will lose.  And Hillary will still run the war on women and her packs will
@dbernstein 	You are a fool! You have no idea what you're talking about. Go back and actually read the research of proven pollsters. 	.
@RaulieGonzo @puppymnkey 	What do you expect from people who have no loyalty or core.  They have no compass.
@EugeneDaniels2 	But that means nothing to a Sanders'	Supporter like yourself.  Shameful.
@EugeneDaniels2 	Forward thinking,  and you would've have been fooled.  But of course Hillary knew Trump would never go through with it.
@EugeneDaniels2 	To answer the way that he did.  Common sense should've told you that he wasn't going to follow through.  Just a little
@EugeneDaniels2 	We're a reporter who had good instincts. You would've notice that Jimmy Kimmel's question caught him off guard and he had
@EugeneDaniels2 	Debate and he simply wouldn't. Trump knows debates aren't his string suit.  He would do anything to avid them.  And if you
@EugeneDaniels2 	Well,  if you had followed the Ending of the Republican Primary,  you would've seen how hard Cruz tried to get Donald to
@EugeneDaniels2 	Reporter,  you would've reported and should've known that Trump would never go through with a debate with Sanders.  How?
@EugeneDaniels2 	Your report on Hillary being hurt by the fact that a debate was mentioned was wrong.  First of all,  if you were a good
@ivancouronne 	To show up at rallies to visibly show support.
@ivancouronne 	Like this,  please be mindful of the silent majority that do feel great joy over Hillary.  They are just too busy working
@ivancouronne 	After the contests actually mattered.  She won by seven points in one state and six in another.  When you write articles
@ivancouronne 	There were no big rallies for Hillary but the passion and excitement moved many more people to cast ballots for Clinton weeks
@ivancouronne 	And remember, in two states,  Nebraska and Washington,  Clinton won both primaries. She had much more support than Sanders.
@ivancouronne 	Objective in your interpretation of events.  Hillary has what it takes to move people to support her.
@ivancouronne 	Just because Sanders' supporters show up at rallies doesn't mean they have a monopoly on excitement. You should be more
@ivancouronne 	Your analysis on Clinton missing enthusiasm is horsecrap! Clinton has many people who are excited about her candidacy.
@DWilloughy @MrDane1982 	The socialist is a thief.
@SkinnerLiber8ed @SDzzz @thecattribe 	Except Sanders' supporters. It's tragic!
@SkinnerLiber8ed @SDzzz @thecattribe 	Turned their firepower on him.  The moment they do,  his numbers would plummet. Everyone knows that
@SkinnerLiber8ed @SDzzz @thecattribe 	Don't be selective in what you use.  The reason Sanders numbers are good is because they haven't
@SkinnerLiber8ed @SDzzz @thecattribe 	Will tell you all you need to know about how his colleagues feel about him now.  They hate him!

@John_DesMarteau @MrDane1982 	In politics in the Democratic Party.

@BillPalmer23 	Thank you for your article on Sanders. It was right on time!
@ColleenMNelson 	She was right!  As usual. Now,  get behind her!
@bpshow 	And Hillary should treat him just like she is: a nobody!  An irritant that should be squashed like a bug!

@MoonAngelWings 	They will run that take and call him unAmerican with the weak on foreign policy and socialism.  He doesn't stand a chance
@MoonAngelWings 	Yes!  Remember in the debate with Hillary where they found an old tape if him siding with the communists in South America?

@learnedhand65 @thecattribe @SDzzz 	Right!
@SDzzz @thecattribe 	I agree.  They don't want to join in and unite.  They want to believe he has a chance. He doesn't! They are misguided.
@Kimberly124 @TAW3343 	Absolutely right.  This is all about him and his power-hungry wife.  The campaign manager as well!

@jonallendc @MSNBC 	No!  You bastard!
@ajjaffe 	You are a fool!

@kenvogel 	What are you talking about?  Hillary is perfectly able to take on Trump. Why don't you just keep your opinions to yourself.
@Richardafowler 	There is nothing she can do until Sanders leave and stay gone.
@Lis_Smith 	Real talent.  Go take a long walk off a short cliff,  you moron of a person!  I wanted to call you something else.  Step off!

@Yamiche 	Toxic for me.  I would encourage everyone I know not To Vote for him.  Clinton people feel the same way!  You all don't have a
@Yamiche 	People feel the exact same way Sanders people feel.  I personally would never vote for Sanders.  He has made this primary too
@Yamiche 	Why ate you so sour? Democrats will line up behind Clinton.  One thing I don't understand about you Sanders' supporters. Clinton
@AnnieLinskey 	You want chaos at the convention because he has lost.  You are pathetic!
@AnnieLinskey 	Drop the hate and anger. The socialist can't win a general anyway.
@AnnieLinskey general.
@AnnieLinskey 	They will unite.  You are angry because Bernie had lost.  Get over it!  Hillary will be the nominee and she will win the
@ThomasARoberts 	General election.
@ThomasARoberts 	Aware of your biased love for Bernie Sanders. I just say,  get behind Hillary. She has won the primary and will win the
@ThomasARoberts 	Hillary will get a large number of Sanders' supporters. Regardless of your 'character' comment.  Hillary's people are well
@ChrisJansing 	Say that she is still having problems. You were never a good reporter to begin with.  After that segment,  I'm convinced.
@ChrisJansing 	You weren't satisfied with having viewers leave your report with that good comment the last woman had for her.  You had to
@singernews 	Pushed out just like she was.  I wonder if your politics will allow it.  The socialist can't win,  and that's the truth.
@singernews 	We're you a part of that group?  You probably were. If so, why aren't you. Doing the same thing to Sanders?  He deserves to be
@singernews 	Hillary's defense when she was behind in delegates.  The media was pushing her out and became extremely hostile towards her.
@singernews 	Those statements and add no context.  But maybe context is not what you want.  I bet eight years ago, you didn't come to
@singernews 	By the Republican machine.  His numbers would tank if he actually got the nomination.  It burns me up to see people write
@singernews 	Piece by saying that his numbers are better is also misleading.  You of all people know that Sanders had never been attacked
@singernews 	Your piece with Eliza Collins was a huge joke.  Everyone knows Trump will never debate the socialist.  And to conclude the
@MichaelSteele 	Say anything!
@MichaelSteele 	He completely ignored them and the request. He has not been cooperative with State.  You will say anything to hurt Hillary.
@MichaelSteele 	You just lied!  Colin Powell was asked by the State Dept.  To turn over all past email that he neglected to turn over.
@maggieNYT 	Remembers who were treating her differently from everyone else.  You as well!
@maggieNYT 	Too bad you didn't mention it while you were adding fuel to the fire with Chris.  Once Hillary becomes president,  I hope she
@maggieNYT 	I'm sure you knew that Condi Rice's top staff all used private email. Of course you know this because you know everything.
@ChrisCuomo 	And over again.  She spent all day yesterday explaining the email issue.  And here you are again.  Too much!
@ChrisCuomo 	Talk out of both sides of their mouths. First,  you jump on her for being guarded and then you tear her to pieces over and over
@ChrisCuomo 	Know why she ever sat down and gave you an interview. I truly understand why she us so guarded.  It's people like you that

@joshrogin 	If you had the guts, you could've told those two hags that she has the numbers and will be the nominee. Sanders needs to go home
@joshrogin 	Right?  The hypocrisy of you and others now is so mind-boggling. She is going to be the nominee. How is she being arrogant?
@joshrogin 	Hillary out of the race and she was much closer to Senator Obama.  I'm sure you felt she should have gotten out of the race too
@joshrogin 	How is Hillary being arrogant when she's 85 delegates away from getting the nomination. Eight years ago, people were pushing

@stableford 	Art type.  Hillary would never win that primary.  Her people are out working for a living.  No time to waste creating Sanders'

@NooneOfan @ChrisCuomo 	Absolutely! A nothing with a huge side of nothing! He did what he ought to have done.  Nothing special.
@michaelscherer 	Anything to help Sanders.  Sanders at any cost.  Well,  she will be the nominee. Get over it!
@michaelscherer 	Your entire interview was based on hurting Hillary.  Your absolute glee to tie Hillary with governor of Virginia was low!
@ChrisCuomo	Get over it!  Hillary will get the nomination. So get over Sanders!
@ChrisCuomo 	You are a Sanders supporter and your interview is all about Helping Sanders get the nomination. News Flash!  Sanders is done!
@michaelscherer 	To go on MSNBC and stick the knife in Hillary's back.  A Sanders supporter,  I'm sure. He's still going to lose. Step off!

@NateSilver538 he couldn't win. Stay away from that type of gross politics.
@NateSilver538 helped t create this beast called Sanders because they constantly placed him on the same level as Clinton, knowing
@NateSilver538 	supporters of Bernie and are loathe to push hi8m out. Why? Because they believe in his message. The media has

@jimsciutto 	But thank you for continuing with your broadcast.  You made many Clinton supporters happy this evening.  Have a good night.

@NickyWoolf 	You cover a Clinton rally and ask her people how many of them appreciate Sanders dragging this contest out? How many of them
@NickyWoolf 	You seem to love covering the Sanders' rallies and having his people opine about how they "may" vote for Hillary.  Why don't
@CrazyYoHi @corporatepigs29 @DailyNewsBin 	Or are we allowed to say that a socialist is not what we want to see in the White House?  Curious
@CrazyYoHi @corporatepigs29 @DailyNewsBin 	Would you want Clinton supporters to support Sanders if he had the numbers Clinton has?
@CrazyYoHi @DailyNewsBin 	So,  once Hillary wins,  you're going to stay home and pout about a revolution that never happened?
@CrazyYoHi @corporatepigs29 @DailyNewsBin 	Sour grapes!

@CrazyYoHi @corporatepigs29 @DailyNewsBin 	He will not get the nomination. Get on board with Hillary.
@CrazyYoHi @DailyNewsBin 	It's still not here. Hill has the numbers and superdelegates.  Time for general election.

@CrazyYoHi @corporatepigs29 @DailyNewsBin 	It won't work for this election. It's over,  Rick.  You're young and idealistic. That great!
@CrazyYoHi @corporatepigs29 @DailyNewsBin 	He's too extreme.
@CrazyYoHi @corporatepigs29 @DailyNewsBin 	Yes,  he is.  Whether you want to admit it or not.  He will lose a general.

@sixer67 	The other because she's more right Wing and don't want Hillary to get the nomination. You were right.  She must focus on general.

@fran_chambers 	Standard!  Hillary always gets the short end of every stick when the media is involved.  It happened then and it's

@fran_chambers 	If she hadn't done that,  you would be speaking about her lack of effort today.  Why won't you say Bernie has the same
@fran_chambers 	Like I expressed to you before now,  eight years ago,  Hillary was expected to bring her supporters to Senator Obama.
@fran_chambers 	You keep saying the Hillary has work to do,  but you don't mention Bernie and how he must bring his people along.  Why?
@NomikiKonst 	Everything you stated doesn't matter. The Democratic Party will not go with Bernie Sanders as nominee.  He can't win!
@DWStweets 	You Handled Steve Kornackie just rightly.  He's a far lefty, bent on getting Bernie Sanders the nomination.  You were great!

@jheil 	Me feel that you don't want Hillary to get the nomination. Are you for Sanders? Must be.  I'm really surprised at you, John.
@jheil 	He hadn't been attacked by the Republican machine.  You know this,  and yet,  you don't say this when given the chance.  This makes

@TalKopan 	Seen that Hillary keeps her voters when it's  Hillary against Trump.  Sanders loses 35 percent of his voters to Trump in a
@TalKopan 	First of all,  Hillary lost to Sanders due to independents who lean Republican. If you had done your research, you would've
@jonvoss 	35 percent of his voters to Trump.  It appears to me that you have a strong bias against Hillary.
@jonvoss 	What you failed to cover was the fact that 84 percent of Clinton voters continue to vote for her against Trump.  But Sanders loses
@jonallendc @MSNBC 	Thank you very much for making the case that Bernie hasn't been tested by Republicans in ads.  Thank you!
@DavidChalian 	Purpose.
@DavidChalian 	You didn't get that correctly. Sanders loses his support but Clinton keeps her support. One would think you did that on
@PaulBegala 	You know this.
@PaulBegala 	Paul,  remember, Republicans haven't run one negative ad against Sanders.  That's why his numbers are so great.
@smerconish 	But they want Democrats to nominate Sanders. They don't want to touch him.  Seems like some Dems are falling for it.
@smerconish 	His numbers would drop like stones if Republicans actually ran the socialist ads they know they could run in swing states.
@smerconish 	Hillary has and over a long period of time.  When was the last negative ad against Sanders by Republicans? Oh,  there were none
@smerconish 	You fail to remember that the reason Sanders does well is because he has not had a sustained number of ads run against him.
@OliviaSterns 	Agencies they hate.
@OliviaSterns 	What are you saying?  Trump didn't steal WV.  That state was always going to vote Republican. They hate EPA and other
@RachCrane 	Would you.  You believe in Bernie's message and you hate Hillary.  It's crystal clear!
@RachCrane 	You didn't mention that the Republicans haven't run one single ad against him.  That's why his numbers are so good. But why
@RachCrane 	Can join the movement or get out of the way.  Oh, and tell that woman to get ready to move to Canada.  Tell her to get out!!!
@RachCrane 	You seemed very happy to hear their pure hatred for Hillary.  The point is this... Hillary has the votes and will win.  They
@RachCrane 	Those people in New Jersey are not the majority of Democratic voters there.  Hillary will win New Jersey and send Sanders home.
@fran_chambers 	Be hypocritical. Say openly that Sanders has the responsibility to bring his people to her.  Point blank!  That's fair!
@fran_chambers 	Senator Obama. You would be one of the people against her now if she said and took the positions Sanders is today.  Don't
@fran_chambers 	Her name would be mud today throughout the party,  and you know that.  The party expected her to actively campaign for
@fran_chambers 	It's up to Sanders to primarily bring his people to Hillary.  If Hillary had pulled the same stunts Sanders is now in 08,
@Yamiche 	You are too close to Sanders.  Back off some.  You must become objective again.  That's all.
@liztrottamerica 	Wow!  It's just too bad you don't/cant give commentary on the nominee of your own party.  It's very telling!  Go Trump! Ha
@CynthiaMcFadden 	Do you know for s Fact that the hacker got inside of Secretary Clinton's server?  Your piece sounds like you know.
@PattiSolisDoyle 	No one found a problem with Senator Obama getting superdelegates from Hillary and using the same rules to win.  Practice!
@PattiSolisDoyle 	That sat next to you lives saying that neither person will reach the number.  Your response should be right years ago
@PattiSolisDoyle 	Him.  I just find it unbelievable that people that go on television are never prepared for  the segments. The woman
@PattiSolisDoyle 	Why is it so hard to remember that the reason Bernie Sanders' numbers are so good is because he hasn't had ads run against
@RepStevenSmith @HillaryClinton @POTUS 	Oh,  come on, Mr. Smith.  You know you like singing Hail to the Chief starring Hillary Clinton.
@DJT4US @rickroberts @HillaryClinton 	Oh,  lighten up!  Sing hail to the chief!  Your new President awaits!  Clinton 2016!!!!
@rickroberts @HillaryClinton 	Yes!!!!!
@staceyhopkinsga 	You would expect Clinton supporters to support him. Such hypocrites!
@staceyhopkinsga 	I am sick and tired of Sanders' supporters pretending not to be Democrats since they lost the primary.  If he had won,
@MartinSavidge 	But that's where your politics are too,  isn't it?
@MartinSavidge 	Sanders' position.  He can't win and he has an obligation to help unite the party. You were too obliging towards her.
@MartinSavidge 	You really loved Stacey Today,  didn't you?  Instead of feeding her false hopes,  you should've been more direct about the
@staceyhopkinsga 	Sanders can't win a national election.  It's up to him to help unite the party.  End of discussion!
@RonMott 	Adults. I find it amazing how biased you were against her at the end of your report.  No matter.  She will win anyway.
@RonMott 	Hillary Clinton's supporters have better things to do than dress up like children's toys.  Why don't you go outside and speak to
@Rhondeezie @MarieLeff @CNN 	Why don't you go first and tell her about it!
@MeSaare @Rhondeezie @MarieLeff @CNN 	Absolutely!
@MarieLeff @CNN 	You're pathetic!
@KevinWTHR 	When Hillary wins Indiana,  you should come back on MSNBC and apologize for that biased report. You Republican!
@TerryOBrien80 @cstreater @HillaryClinton 	At four billion.  I know you like Trump but he won't win a general against Hillary.
@TerryOBrien80 @cstreater @HillaryClinton 	You must know that he doesn't have ten billion dollars.  His estimated wealth has been placed
@DudeKembro @obama_speech @reaDonaldTrump @HillaryClinton 	Yes! Well said,  my friend.
@bobby990r_1 @HillaryClinton 	It had worked.  She will be the next President of the United States.
@twright55 @HillaryClinton 	The same way you're questioning her with the past you have.  No different.
@JosephPruitt @HillaryClinton 	No she doesn't. Stop telling lies on your future president.  She should be treated with respect.
@TerryOBrien80 @cstreater @HillaryClinton 	How is he a success?  Multiple bankruptcies, and God only knows what else.
@cstreater @HillaryClinton 	Amen!
@roz233 @NeilTurner_ 	Yes,  he is!
@NeilTurner_ @HillaryClinton 	Are you a Trump supporter? Or Bernie supporter?
@smilleforrme 	Thanks!
@AmerZahr 	You're a horrible person.
@EdwardARowe1 	I will follow you back. Don't worry.
@issielapowsky 	Nice.
@LUCKYMW @JesseLehrich @joanwalsh 	Sour grapes never taste good. Join Hillary and make history!
@JesseLehrich @TAW3343 	Thank you for bringing facts to the table.
@Gabriella__CC @Castro4Congress @HillaryClinton @ReadyforCastro 	Yes!!!!!!
@puppymnkey 	Are
@puppymnkey 	Hero's
@puppymnkey 	Dare
@puppymnkey 	Don't you dear take that to heart.  Your dad was a hero.  You are a Jeri's child.  They ate angry because Hillary has won.
@samoski @kreativekonnect @gdebenedetti	Sour grapes never taste good.  Get behind Hillary and prosper!
@EB_Asbr @HillaryClinton @realDonaldTrump 	How would you know?  Are you on her staff?  Just asking.
@BWilliams 	Not bad for a democratic socialist!  Wow! Way to go,  Brian.
@CindyLeinwand12 @Lee_in_Iowa 	Thank you!!!!!!
@jonallendc @MSNBC 	June.
@jonallendc @MSNBC 	You won't see Senator Sanders disrupt the Democratic convention. This temper tantrum will be dealt with in July.
@CHPdog @NeishaBlandin @mommapolitico @HillaryClinton 	Yes!!!!!!!
@aquintinilla @NeishaBlandin @HillaryClinton 	Nice tweet!
@TaylotAnah @NeishaBlandin @HillaryClinton 	Absolutely!
@salbron 	Story.
@salbron 	Better because no one knows him,  really.  His socialist views haven't been hashed out. Shame on you for not telling the whole
@salbron 	Ads?  It is your responsibility as a journalist to give the reader a more accurate picture and sadly you failed. He only does
@salbron 	How could you not mention that Bernie Sanders' numbers only look the way that they do because he hasn't been touched by negative
@AnitaFinlay 	Yes!
@AmerZahr 	Bernie and his people will be talked off the ledge after California.
@AmerZahr 	Hillary.  That of course will never happen.  So,  you can say what you want. This situation will not go to the convention.
@AmerZahr 	He hasn't had one negative as run against him.  The reason is simple... The Republicans want dumb Democrats to choose him over
@AmerZahr 	He will never get the nomination.  Julie is pulling for Your side because she and other Republicans know they can beat Bernie.
@AmerZahr 	Should have the final say.  Now that you're losing,  it's the superdelegates that must be pursued.  Bernie is a hypocrite.
@AmerZahr 	The superdelegates will never leave Hillary for someone they are beginning to hate. The first argument was the pledged delegates
@AmerZahr 	Bernie is not the better candidate.  He will not pass Hillary in pledged delegates.  He is creating Ernie's all over the party.
@DanniLmc can change after this primary.  He's not the better candidate.  You were woefully ill-prepared for that session.
@DanniLmc 	Please do research before you go on another show.  Bernie will never pass her in delegates!  You could've that the system
@DanniLmc 	People along.
@DanniLmc 	The questions you will be asked.  You could've taken him.  Please, you could've said that Trump alone will bring many of his
@DanniLmc 	You must remember that Sanders has had no negative ads run against that's why his numbers are good now.  You must think about
@NaphiSoc @Lee_in_Iowa 	Good job!
@38_28_38 @gdebenedetti @Gus_802 	Amen!
@kreativekonnect @gdebenedetti 	No voter fraud. Stop the lies.  The election turned out exactly the way it should have.
@gdebenedetti @Lee_in_Iowa 	Now that's what you call ironic!
@ShazBooty714 @Lee_in_Iowa @HillarysMen @HillaryClinton 	You're great!  Keep the Faith!
@keeganw86173681 @nytimes 	Just as stupid as the people in Idaho,  Minnesota, Utah, Wisconsin, New Hampshire, Washington State, etc.
@MissArielleBee @nytimes 	Go away!  No one care about your pitty party. We've moved on.  Bernie's people should move along with us.
@nytimes @Lane4HRC 	Now. That's what I like!  Clinton 2016!!!!!
@SelenaGomezMB 	Good job this morning with Mika.  She understood exactly what you were saying. Thanks!
@Eugene_Robinson 	Please remember, Sanders numbers are good because no ads have been done against him in a sustained way.  Remember.
@BWilliams 	I love the way you dealt with Andrea at the end of her report. Moved right pass her to the rope line. Jeff is insane!  No path.
@howardfineman 	Now Chris,  if they're still counting the vote at eleven,  Bernie wins.  He fought her to a draw.  Clinton 2016!!!!!
@Hoptoad4 @puppymnkey 	They only see one thing and that's getting the nomination by any means necessary. No matter how much damage is done.
@JSavoly @puppymnkey 	Great!
@AdamSmith_USA @puppymnkey 	I agree!
@BuckwheatHull 	It took him long enough.
@MarkHarrisNYC @puppymnkey 	Good job!
@BRUCEHAWES @HillarysMen @hinslgretl @HillaryClinton 	She's willing to listen.
@HillarysMen @HillaryClinton 	Yes!
@BWilliams 	Brian,  	You will see Lawrence tomorrow. Tell him he has lost a viewer. He was very biased tonight. At ten, I change channel.
@Lawrence 	It Crystal clear who you want to win tomorrow. Glad Barney screamed at you!  Very biased!
@Lawrence 	Thank you for having an embed with the Clinton rally tonight.
@CecileRichards 	The chicken joke was hilarious. I couldnt stop laughing. And your delivery was priceless!
@mitchellreports 	Jump off.  Saving all of us the hassle of dealing with you ever again!
@mitchellreports 	Your pure hatred for Hillary is palpable. After she wins by double digits tomorrow, why don't you walk up to the roof and
@MsTaraDowdell 	Thank you!
@JNSmall 	I guess you can never look forward to being given an interview by the 45 President. Feel that burn!
@patrickhealynyt 	Your candidate Bernie Sanders will not win tomorrow and instead of laughing as Chris speaks, you should've been disgusted
@TheRyanParker @puppymnkey 	Great!
@DebraMessing 	Thank you for standing up for Hillary. Also,  loved you in Will and Grace!
@aravosis @puppymnkey Absolutely!
@PuestoLoco @puppymnkey Yes!!!!!!
@SoccerLacrossMa @ZerlinaMaxwell @skorpyos @tedstew 	Hillary's supporters do!
@CultusMusicorum @mcoop @RiseUpProg @HFA @HillaryClinton 	Start their as campaign,  it's over.
@CultusMusicorum @mcoop @RiseUpProg @HFA @HillaryClinton 	Sanders can't win a national election. He's too extreme. Once the Republicans
@KenTietjen @puppymnkey @HuffingtonPost 	Wonderfully done!!!!! Clinton 2016!!!!
@CultusMusicorum @mcoop @RiseUpProg @HFA @HillaryClinton 	It's very progressive.
@JoyAnnReid 	Went out there and started dialogue. Why not the all important man of the downtrodden...Mr.  Bernie Sanders.
@JoyAnnReid 	Has your precious Bernie Sanders gone out to the housing projects yet?  I told Richie Torres he wouldn't, and he won't. Hillary
@CultusMusicorum @mcoop @RiseUpProg @HFA @HillaryClinton 	How do you know that?  Do you pal around with her?  Shut you mouth!
@Corinne0721 @Parker9_ @HFA 	Right back at you. Turd!
@RiseUpProg @HFA @HillaryClinton 	Why are you on Hillary's email
@Parker9_ @HFA 	Get off of Hillary's email!
@CarrieNBCNews 	Unfavorable raining too.  If Sanders and Kasich are ever subject to sustained attacks by the other party, their numbers fall
@CarrieNBCNews 	The problem with your poll on favorability is both Sanders and Kasich have never been tested ad wise and Cruz has high
@JeanneZaino 	That they are so well-known.
@JeanneZaino 	You must know that those numbers are false. What were you thinking? What makes Hillary and Trump better candidates is the fact
@JeanneZaino 	How could you not mention that likability numbers of Sanders and Kasich is due to not having negative ads run against them?
@jacobsoboroff 	Are insane to believe Bernie Sanders can win a national election!
@jacobsoboroff 	Where was the representative for Hillary Clinton?  All of you at MSNBC have been biased from day one.  You ultraliberals
@shaqbrewster 	Bernie Sanders supporters are insane.  Who would throw money at a car?  Foolish!
@Bakari_Sellers 	Supporters felt 8 years ago when Hillary was in Bernie's position now.
@Bakari_Sellers 	The next time Nina Turner talks about the system being rigged on Democrats side,  ask her how she and all the other Sanders
@ron_fournier 	Hillary never asked for your advice on emails so why don't you just mind your own business.  Concentrate on your own issues.
@ssiggy1 	She's not releasing the speeches.  Clearly,  you know the judge wants Bernie because she knows he'll lose to the Republicans.
@LarrySabato 	You want the chaos on the Democratic side but you won't get it.
#pamelabrown	You're no friend of Hillary.  I was really wrong about you.
@sallykohn @MariaTCardona 	Thank you.
@EditorMikeO @MariaTCardona 	Absolutely!
@DallasChad1 @MariaTCardona 	Absolutely!
@MariaTCardona @CNN @CNNnewsroom @NomikiKonst 	She had no real response. Good job!
@MariaTCardona @CNN @CNNnewsroom @NomikiKonst 	Yes!!!!!!  You mentioned it!  He hadn't been hit with Republican ads.  I'm so proud of you.
@Fairshare2012 @CNN @MSNBC @BernieSanders 	You're right!  Pamela is in the tank for Bernie!
@AtkinsonReports 	Candidate.  Well,  I assume you know that.
@AtkinsonReports 	To write this article shows great ignorance in the political system.  You should know that Hillary is the stronger
@AtkinsonReports 	You really aren't ignorant enough to believe the RP,  head of Republican Party,  really wants Hillary over Sanders?
@dklaidman 	Good job on MSNBC today!  Clinton 2016!!!!
@EvanRThies 	It's too bad your candidate is poised to lose on Tuesday.  Hillary Clinton 2016!!!!!
@DC_para @tonydokoupil @MSNBC Doesn't matter.  They will find people that hate her regardless.  They love the socialist!
@marygray6028 @tonydokoupil @MSNBC down a huge toilet stool,  I would!
@marygray6028 @tonydokoupil @MSNBC 	I feel the same way!  They all hate this woman so much.  If I could just take them all and flush them
@tonydokoupil 	They can't take their sandwich and shove it up their rear ends!
@tonydokoupil 	Be objective.  It's also clear that Alex hates Hillary as well.  Shame on all of you so-called objective reporters.
@tonydokoupil 	Your endeavor to be objective while reporting falls very short.  It's clear you don't care for Hillary.  You could at least
@AlexWitt 	The mayor's wife did an excellent job.  Even your right-wing attack questions didn't rattle her.
@HumanitarianGal @savannastc @BarackObama @SenSanders 	He'll never get them.
@HillaryClinton 	Yes!
@puppymnkey 	I agree!  He's been angry and bitter.  The Democrats are getting very tired of his baseless attacks on Hillary.
@motherglover1 @BobbyTBD They do. My patience runs thinly sometimes too.  But I think about Hillary and keep going.
@BobbyTBD @savannastc Amen!
@RobertaLSpence2 @savannastc @HillaryClinton 	Yes!
@JimGoodluck @Kamgirl47 	You got it!
@javieboi @Kamgirl47 @Honey17011 	Absolutely!
@Kamgirl47 @savannastc 	Absolutely!
@ljoywilliams 	Good job, today! Come on television more often.
@RitchieTorres 	Of the forgotten won't even visit the forgotten.  That your candidate: Bernie Sanders.
@RitchieTorres 	Who really cares.  Bernie will not come out. I will make that prediction. The sad part is what you stated: this candidate
@RitchieTorres 	Did respond when asked.  Did you actually are the concern in her face?  The speech she gave to residents.  She is the one
@RitchieTorres 	Bernie Sanders has no incentive to come out to the projects' areas.  It will be a miracle if he actually shows up.  Hillary
@RitchieTorres 	On television now is political.
@RitchieTorres 	Excuse.  If this was such a huge issue for you,  why didn't you reach out to her when you ride to become a deputy?  Being
@RitchieTorres 	Well,  you're not in middle school now.  Have you ever asked her for a sit down?  Don't use being in middle school as an
@RitchieTorres 	Mattered.  And that's when she was the senator from NY.  Your presence now is just disgusting!
@RitchieTorres 	Look is all political.  Quite frankly, I would believe you really cared if you had done the reaching out when it really
@RitchieTorres 	It seems to me like you're a Bernie Sanders  person trying to make Hillary look badly,  but this whole television interview
@RitchieTorres 	It seems to me like you're playing politics with this issue. Hillary would've come out to meet with you.  There is no doubt.
@RitchieTorres 	It's amazing that you are crying out for help now around election time.  Where were you during her actual tenure as senator?
@MsTaraDowdell 	Great job defending Hillary!  Thank you!
@mbieseck 	You ate an honest broker.  Go jump off a building,  you turd!
@mbieseck 	Of course in your biased article you mentioned 'home brew server.' You are extremely biased.  No one who is impartial believes
@kwelkernbc 	Their detail.  Go cover Sanders!  You would be right at home.  No subjectivity!
@kwelkernbc 	As well.  Anything to help Sanders and hurt Hillary is your aim. I really hope the Clinton campaign wakes up and put you off
@kwelkernbc 	Your piece this morning comparing Hillary in California and Bernie is Rome was very insidious. Playing Bill Clinton's remarks
@kwelkernbc 	No!
@PattiSolisDoyle 	Know these things when on TV.  That's what being a representative on TV means.
@PattiSolisDoyle 	Patti,  how could you not being up 'Lyon Ted Cruz' when Cruz's representative spoke Hillary being untrustworthy? You must
@james3sun 	Great job today on CNN. Keep up the interviews. Clinton 2016!!!!
@NationalMemo @savannastc 	Where are they?
@NationalMemo @savannastc 	Yes!  Here are they?
@Tonyrocks345 @BeverlyRoderick @HillaryClinton 	You hear lies from Sanders. Get it rightly.
@wmroderick @BeverlyRoderick @sherrilee7 @HillaryClinton 	Yes!
@BeverlyRoderick @savannastc @HillaryClinton 	Amen,  my friend!
@CarolCNN 	You are hoping Bernie wins.  The Republicans can easily beat him and you're all for that, aren't you?
@CarolCNN 	Who do you think you're fooling?  You're a Republican that wants Bernie because you know he can be beaten. We know this!
@harryjaffe 	You are a fool!  Bernie doesn't matter at all.  Go away.  He's too negative and nasty.
@antonioarch @savannastc 	Yes!  They were great!
@smbear55 @puppymnkey 	He was very disrespectful with that comment. Donna put him in his place on CNN.
@KingofPopTweets @savannastc 	Amen!
@puppymnkey 	Thanks,  Friend!
@errollouis 	What a softball question to Sanders on Bill Clinton.
@Pirateofdabronx @AmericaFerrera @emilyslist @Medium 	You lose in the end,  as usual!
@Pirateofdabronx @AmericaFerrera @emilyslist @Medium 	Go away!  Sanders can't win a national election.
@puppymnkey @AmericaFerrera 	I am as well.  It's all about Bernie Sanders.  He never wanted to be a Democrat. Now,  he does. Hypocrite!
@ChuckLane1 	Against him.  Don't you realize that? Charles!  Wait up and stop sleeping! They want Bernie.  The numbers are wrong!
@ChuckLane1 	Because they want him to be the nominee. He loses if he's the nominee. The Republicans would love to run socialist ads
@ChuckLane1 	Tested by the Republican machine.  But you never brought that out either.  Charles and Bret looked at one another in silence
@ChuckLane1 	How could you sit there and defend The numbers stating that Bernie Sanders can defeat the Republicans? Clearly he hadn't been
@agearan 	Ms. Mitchell are full of it!  Hillary thrives on your hatred o her.
@agearan 	Your hatred for Hillary will do nothing but give you medical problems. She will win NY and the other states.  You and
@BenJealous 	You don't get it!  Bernie can't win a national election.  Too bad you don't recognize that.
@Bakari_Sellers 	Good job!  Her supports both love her and are very enthusiastic about her. Thanks for making that clear.
@paulysong 	Go away,  Paul Song!  We don't need to hear your hate one minute longer.
@ProgRebel @obbiecole 	You would know what tin is.  Look at your photo.  How old are you?  70! Trying to look 30. Please!
@paulysong @Shakestweetz 	You ate some piece of work!  You were referring to Hillary.
@paulysong @Shakestweetz 	It was about Hillary.  You know that and so do we.
@paulysong 	You are a disgrace!
@paulysong 	You are a disgrace!
@UltimateTennis_ @HillaryClinton @NationalAction 	She'll do just fine.  Don't worry.  She'll do better than Bernie!
@spencerthayer 	I could say the same about Bernie Sanders.  He refuses to release at least 15 to 20 years of income tax forms.  Why is that?
@spencerthayer 	I appeal to your better nature.  Take down the site and embrace Hillary.  You will be the better for it.  I promise.
@spencerthayer 	Line.
@spencerthayer 	Would you rather have Trump or Cruz?  Think long and hard before you answer.  The Supreme Court and progressive policies on
@spencerthayer 	Why would you want to further divide the party? She will be the nominee. Bernie can't win nationally. Better you know that.
@spencerthayer 	You are some piece of work!  Hillary will unite the party with or without your support. She will win NY and beyond.  Clinton
@Lawrence 	The socialist supporting another socialist.  Why Hillary shouldn't be surprised. She never stood a chance with many at MSNBC.
@AprilDRyan 	Why couldn't you just tell the truth?  When Bernie loses NY,  it's over.  You know that.  There will be no contested convention
@Lawrence 	This nomination is over after NY.  Face the facts. Bernie is a loser!
@mg49erfan @DavidFWhitten67 @cstreater 	Absolutely!
@aecdemblue @NYDailyNews @HillaryClinton 	And right you are!
@mg49erfan @joem341 @NYDailyNews @HillaryClinton 	Absolutely! He would love it then.  Hypocrite!
@joem341 @mg49erfan @NYDailyNews @HillaryClinton 	Go away!  And take the old goat with you.

@donnabrazile 	Please don't allow Bernie Sanders to disrupt the national convention in July. Thanks!
@Bakari_Sellers 	Good job tonight on Anderson Cooper.  You also did very well the night Hillary lost Michigan. Your reasonableness won!
@NYWFP 	You should be ashamed.  Supporting a stranger over your own Senator. I'm sure Hillary had done great things for your group. 	.
@jonathantasini 	The old goat has no chance!  Get out of the race!
@margarettalev 	Hillary will be the nominee. Bernie is unelectable. He's McGovern on steroids!
@BWilliams 	You on nights when she's doing great and not so great.  Keep being in her corner.  Thank you!
@BWilliams 	It's a pleasure to write you.  It's actually great to encounter an anchor who really is happy when Hillary wins.  Many look to
@AriMelber 	Are Few souring on Clinton?  What about Democrats souring on a socialist?
@morningmika 	Didn't you just love the polls on the Democratic side today?  Clinton 2016!!!!!
@GovHowardDean 	I have no doubt you will do a great job on Lawrence's show tonight.  Have a great debate!
@JimHightower 	Bernie Sanders is another McGovern. The Democratic Party would be suicidal to nominate him.  Hillary can win!

@LuisSepulvedaNY 	Lies!  He can't even explain his on policies.

@aseitzwald 	Sorry Bernie is doing do poorly. Now, you how Hillary supporters eel when you treat her with disdain.  Clinton 2016!!!!!
@aseitzwald 	Will you please write an article about how Hillary's win in NY puts her on a trajectory to put Bernie away for good? Thanks.
@MarkHalperin 	Thank you for injecting some truth at that table.  The hand-ringing was pathetic.
@kwelkernbc 	Hillary is actually winning the young African American vote.  Do your homework. It'd young whites she's losing.  Biased!
@RepJeffries 	Great job this morning!  Keep fighting the good fight!!!  Clinton 2016!!!
@GStephanopoulos 	Me.  Please state this to him if you ever get the chance to interview him again.
@GStephanopoulos 	Numbers are high. Why do you think his numbers are so high?  He hadn't been attacked by Republicans. This is strange to
@GStephanopoulos 	George,  how could you not say to Bernie Sanders that he hasn't been attacked vigorously by Republicans and that's why his
@KenzaMoller 	Your article BELONGS in the trash heap of history.  Bernie will never win NY.  He's a McGovernlike candidate that can't win!
@HeidiPrzybyla 	In your imagination. You Republicans are deathly afraid of her in a general.  That's why you're pushing the socialist.
@HeidiPrzybyla 	Your hatred for Hillary is exactly why she will win NY and become the nominee.  There are no questions about her.  That's
@sgrant525 	I like your pictures on the front page. Good picks.
@sgrant525 @HillaryClinton 	Absolutely!!! Clinton 2016!!!!

@SaculSacul 	Hi.  Just saw Sanders' campaign worker on Fox News saying how they will win NY.  Now,  tell me why Republicans at Fox News are
@hilaryr 	Hi,  you must work on your television appearances. You use many words to say simple things.  Not good.
@thinkingdem @Enjoneer01 @cascamike @aseitzwald @BernieSanders 	The real question is: who can explain and implement their policies?
@savannastc 	Amen!!!!!! Keep it up!!!!!  Clinton 2016!!!!!!
@sharhasarrived @savannastc @aseitzwald 	When it counted,  he couldn't tell the editorial board what they were and how he would accomplish.
@errollouis 	A simple yes would've been sufficient. Hillary has the state.
@JimMiklaszewski 	The president did a great job today,  don't you think?  Clinton 2016!!!!!
@BenRodriguez413 @MariaTCardona 	Absolutely, that's exactly why she will be the nominee.
@Doublebeekabug @RamonKCastillo @aseitzwald 	Only if Bernie goes first. God knows he can't explain what he believes in and will accomplish.
@Doublebeekabug @RamonKCastillo @aseitzwald 	Being proud of and supporting the person most qualified is a good thing.  Join in!!!!
@AlexWitt 	You're trying to place divisions among Democrats with your program. Won't work. Clinton 2016!!!!!
@MadisonSiriusXM 	Best standard bearer for the Democrats. She is a Democrat, and she understands her own policies.  Bernie doesn't.
@MadisonSiriusXM 	I like you,  How,  but Bernie has no chance for this nomination and supporting him keeps his hopes up.  Hillary is the
@Doublebeekabug @RamonKCastillo @aseitzwald 	Go figure!!!!
@Doublebeekabug @RamonKCastillo @aseitzwald 	Good figure!!!!
@Doublebeekabug @RamonKCastillo @aseitzwald 	If that's the case, you should be supporting Hillary.  Sanders is an  independent socialist.
@JoyAnnReid 	She is the most qualified and can win a general election. Clinton 2016!!!!
@JoyAnnReid 	The absolute hatred for her is very noticeable by many of her supporters who watch the sound standard daily.
@JoyAnnReid 	Playing Saturday Night Kobe's clip to embarrass Hillary won't work.  She will win NY and Penn. She will be the nominee.
@jdickerson 	Your biased coverage for Bernie Sanders will be of no account when she wins NY and gets the nomination.  Clinton 2016!!!!!!
@Enjoneer01 @thinkingdem @cascamike @aseitzwald @BernieSanders	The same things they have done to Hillary.  But she has weathered the storm.
@Enjoneer01 @thinkingdem @cascamike @aseitzwald @BernieSanders 	Everything that draws him to people will be what they use against him.
@Enjoneer01 @thinkingdem @cascamike @aseitzwald @BernieSanders 	They don't care about his Senate history. They will tear him apart.
@Enjoneer01 @thinkingdem @cascamike @aseitzwald @BernieSanders 	Where you born yesterday?  Do you not know how Republicans work?
@Enjoneer01 @thinkingdem @cascamike @aseitzwald @BernieSanders 	No.  He hasn't been through what the Republicans will put him through.
@Enjoneer01 @thinkingdem @cascamike @aseitzwald @BernieSanders 	But it's true. Hillary has been tested.
@Enjoneer01 @thinkingdem @cascamike @aseitzwald @BernieSanders 	All of the swing states,  his numbers will drop. You might not  believe it
@Enjoneer01 @thinkingdem @cascamike @aseitzwald @BernieSanders 	On foreign policy.  When they are  done running their ads against him in
@Enjoneer01 @thinkingdem @cascamike @aseitzwald @BernieSanders 	Policies on socialism, raising taxes on middle class, and being weak on
@Enjoneer01 @thinkingdem @cascamike @aseitzwald @BernieSanders 	Been tested.  The Republicans have not run any ads against him based on his
@Enjoneer01 @thinkingdem @cascamike @aseitzwald @BernieSanders	What you and others don't take into account is the fact that Bernie hasn't
@Mariah10Carey88 @YoMommaObama69 	I agree with you totally!
@MidAmericanGuy @NBCNews @BernieSanders @TheDemocrats 	Your candidate is losing.
@MidAmericanGuy @NBCNews @BernieSanders @TheDemocrats 	No fix.  President Obama had the same rules when he won.  Don't get upset because
@SwagyJ237 @NBCNews 	The Bern has been burnt up!  Hillary did great!
@blendedpurple @aseitzwald 	These are the same rules that placed President Obama into the nomination. Don't get upset because you're losing!
@Enjoneer01 @thinkingdem @cascamike @aseitzwald @BernieSanders 	Can't win a general election.
@Enjoneer01 @thinkingdem @cascamike @aseitzwald @BernieSanders 	Important it is to nominate a true Democrat. Bernie is a socialist,  who
@Enjoneer01 @thinkingdem @cascamike @aseitzwald @BernieSanders 	He didn't pull an upset yesterday. Real Democrats now see how
@Real_Food @aseitzwald 	Couldn't agree more!
@Yello_gal @aseitzwald Good tweet!  Thanks!
@shakeelabedi @aseitzwald 	Headlines for Bernie and give Hillary the cold shoulder. He and many others at msnbc will continue to hurt her.
@shakeelabedi @aseitzwald 	Alex is a huge supporter of Bernie Sanders. So,  don't get upset. He will continue to advance positive
@RamonKCastillo @KimiStarr @aseitzwald supporters, you lose.
@RamonKCastillo @KimiStarr @aseitzwald 	No June.  At the end of July,  Hillary will have everything she needs to be nominated. Sorry Sanders
@sharhasarrived @savannastc @aseitzwald 	A sell out!
@sharhasarrived @savannastc @aseitzwald 	Why don't you ask Sanders how he plans to accomplish his policies? He can't tell you. Now, that's
@Doublebeekabug @RamonKCastillo @aseitzwald 	You don't know what shady is.  Shady is not knowing how your own policies work.  That's Sanders
@aseitzwald 	I'm sure this brought you great pleasure to write.
@aseitzwald 	Came to his aid.  I would hope that Hillary would get that type of treatment.
@aseitzwald 	But I didn't see an article about how clueless Sanders was when confronted by the editorial board on his policies.  You all
@aseitzwald 	It seems whenever the Clinton do anything that looks damaging,  you and other proSanders reporters are quick to pounce.
@jaketapper 	You're such a tool for Sanders.  It's pathetic!
@StephanieDube 	Sorry,  the closed primary will stand.  Let Democrats vote for Democrats.  Hillary is a democrat and Sanders is a socialist.
@Charles_Pelkey @BernieSanders 	Process.  Hillary has strong support too.  Play by the rules!
@Charles_Pelkey @BernieSanders 	Nominee. She has the most pledged delegates and superdelegates.  So don't allow sour grapes to disrupt the
@Charles_Pelkey @BernieSanders 	To determine the nominee.  And now that Sanders isn't doing so well,  you're changing.  Hillary will be the
@Charles_Pelkey @BernieSanders 	The rules are the rules.  You progressives started off by saying that pledged delegates should be the ones
@Charles_Pelkey		 @BernieSanders 	Mr. Pellet,  the superdelegates can choose who they want. Don't change the rules to fit your candidate.
@BryanLlenas @FoxFriendsFirst 	Hillary Clinton. And she will win.
@BryanLlenas @FoxFriendsFirst 	He will never win New York! Republicans pushing him won't work either.  The Rep. Nominee will go up against
@BryanLlenas 	The nominee.
@BryanLlenas 	Your pushing the socialist will not work.  Fox sees Sanders as the easier person to beat.  Democrats know this.  He won't be
@kristendahlgren 	Thank you!
@JuanMaBenitez 	Your support for Bernie Sanders is evident.  New York is Hillary country!
@CharlesMBlow 	Or is it just a Hillary Clinton thing? I wonder.
@CharlesMBlow 	Did you make this charge in 2008 about superdelegates when President Obama had the lead?  I can't recall you so adamant.
@ScottCohnTV 	Thanks!
@kristendahlgren 	Congrats!  But become  Little more objective in your reporting. That's it.
@SteveKornacki 	Yes, Steve,  it's too late for your candidate.
@kristendahlgren 	Is that you on the front of the Twitter page?  You've put on weight.
@kristendahlgren 	Your bias reporting is noted. You can love Sanders and hate Hillary.  Just don't do it on air.  Thank you.
@AymanM 	It's very clear that you strongly dislikes Hillary Clinton.  As an on air anchor, it's important to be objective.  You're not.
@kwelkernbc 	Throws you off their plane and tells Sanders to pick you up.
@kwelkernbc 	Why don't you go and work on the Sanders campaign? You push Sanders at every turn.  I would hope that the Clinton campaign
@AlexWitt 	Democrats will nominate Hillary Clinton,  despite what you Republicans in the news media do to push Sanders.  She win general.
@AlexWitt Democrats.  Now you were disappointed with Marsha today.  You don't want Trump or Cruz.  But you know she had to say that.
@AlexWitt	All with the hope of getting dumb Democrats to vote him as the nominee. Your good praise of him will not push him on thinking
@AlexWitt 	And others like Joe Scarborough and Willie etc will do all you can to help push Bernie Sanders on the scene with good praise.
@AlexWitt 	The Sanders' campaign first position was delegates should count and not superdelegates. But we know what's happening here. You
@AlexWitt 	You're good, but not good enough.  I noticed that you didn't ask Nina about the Sanders' campaign first position on superdelegate
@nikawright95	Sanders hadn't been put under any heavy combat from Republican. Surely you know that once that happens, his poll numbers drop!
@nikawright95 	Sorry,  but you're wrong. Bernie doesn't beat many people in a head to head.  Surely a woman of your intelligence knows that
@jelani9 	It's clear that you don't like Hillary.  Too bad.  I believe she would be a great president.  Your attitude towards her showed.
@edhenry 	You can keep going after Hillary but like you painfully must admit,  she will eventually win.  Clinton 2016!!!
@allinwithchris 	The Republicans haven't run their thousands of dollars of ads against him.  You must know that.
@allinwithchris 	You know quite well that the head to head numbers make no difference now.  Why?  Because Sanders hadn't been tested yet.
@ErinBurnett 	You're good.  Stir up the "sexist" issue to keep a fight going among democrats. And muddy up the Democrats. No prize.
@DWStweets 	Hello,  	Please don't allow Bernie Sanders to disrupt the national convention in July.  Once Hillary has the delegates, she wins
@tomforemancnn 	Your hatred for Hillary was on full display today on Tapper's show.  I'm sure she feels the exact same way about you. I hope
@jaketapper 	I really hope Hillary rethinks doing your show from now on.  Only she can make that call.  You are entirely too subjective.
@jaketapper 	Now that I know you're a hyper-liberal,  it makes so much sense why you hate Hillary so much.  Your love for Bernie shows.
@morningmika 	Your dislike for Hillary is palpable.
@morningmika 	Your absolute fake demeanor when Hillary visits is why I hope the Clinton campaign will stop having her appear on your show.
@JoeNBC 	Wait until dumb Democrats perhaps knock out Hillary and nominate him. Then,  we turn our guns on him!  You're good but not great.
@JoeNBC 	He is exactly who you want. Why run ads against the socialist now and allow dumb Democrats to see how unappealing his views are.
@JoeNBC 	You,  Willie,  and other Republicans are very good in promoting Bernie Sanders, who has no chance in winning a national election.
@BrookeBCNN 	Give me one thing you can do to make your anchoring skills more effective?  Very interested in an answer.
@MJGerson 	Hillary has plenty of supporters that trust her.  It's people like you who are afraid of her. Why?  Because you know she will win
@aseitzwald 	Anything that you and other reporters perceive hurts Hillary, you will play.  The media is very dishonest.  Hill will win!
@JessicaTarlov 	Is it so hard for you to do basic research before you go on television? Please study the basics of politics. Please!
@chrislhayes your segment on Bill Clinton was not to shine light on him and his policy  positions.  We both know why you aired it.	Hillary!
@politico I'm sure you had nothing else to tweet about today.  Hillary at a turnstile. That's what you found important. Get a life!
@RepJeffries 	Good evening, thank you for everything you do on behalf of Sec. Clinton.  Keep up the good work!  Win New York for her!!!!!!!
@Pamelabrown21 	Good evening, I'm so thrilled to finally see an anchor that isn't hostile to Hillary Clinton. Thank you for Newton piece.
@tvkatesnow 	Of course you are welcoming Eric Garner's daughter.  Sanders in the person you're backing.  You're not objective.  Not at all.
@Consultant59 @JonStall2009 @lockedgrooves 	Change the picture.  You're get better traffic. One old goat for a presidential candidate.
@sgrant525 	Hi.  Love the picture of an angry Bernie.  Seems like all he knows is anger.  Hillary 2016!
@JonStall2009 @Consultant59 @lockedgrooves 	What a terrible picture! An old goat laughing out loud.  Change the picture. Hillary's better.
@sluggahjells 	Too bad your support won't help Bernie when he's watching Hillary get the nomination. Clinton 2016!
@jdbalart 	It's quite clear you don't like Secretary Clinton.  It would be nice to be objective in your reporting dealing with Hillary.
@PhilipRucker 	You're not a Hillary supporter,  that's quite clear.  But you can have some objectivity in your on camera opportunities.
@SaculSacul 	Hillary Clinton 2016!!!!!
@SaculSacul 	I agree totally with you.  Thanks for your support.  Hillary Clinton 2026!!!! Have a good day, my friend.
@cupfan27 @SaculSacul @MariaTCardona @HillaryClinton 	What a hypocrite. Never wanted to be a Democrat. Now he does. It's all about Sanders.
@cupfan27 @SaculSacul @MariaTCardona @HillaryClinton 	He admitted to not knowing his own policies. And then he lied on Hillary.
@cupfan27 @SaculSacul @MariaTCardona 	Of course I don't agree but he is unqualified. You must be honest and admit that.
@cupfan27 @SaculSacul @MariaTCardona @CNNTonight @donlemon 	He's untested and has no depth to his policies.  He doesn't know his policies.
@cupfan27 @SaculSacul @MariaTCardona @CNNTonight @donlemon 	Then you need to get out more.  He lost his cool tonight. Not ready prime time.
@cupfan27 @SaculSacul @MariaTCardona @CNNTonight @donlemon 	Bernie hasn't been tested.  His numbers would drop once Republican machine is in
@Kermet_Merl_Key @MikesPencil 	She will win both. With or without your support.  Good night.
@Kermet_Merl_Key @MikesPencil 	She will win nomination and presidency. You silly rabbit, silly speech is for kids. Oh,  You are one.
@Earllangit @MariaTCardona 	I agree.  Sanders is under pressure and can't handle it. Unprepared!
@Kermet_Merl_Key @MariaTCardona @CNNTonight @donlemon 	You don't understand pledge delegates. Bernie will not be the nominee. Get over it!
@MariaTCardona @CNNTonight @donlemon 	You didn't mention how Bernie hasn't been tested by Republicans' firing squad.  The numbers are wrong
@MariaTCardona	Hi,  I'm so disappointed in you. How could you not mention that Bernie hasn't been tested by the Republicans' fire squad?
@HAGOODMANAUTHOR 	Don't send anything to my twitter account,  you bastard! Clinton 2016!!!!!!! Choke on it!!!!!!
@frate	Your subjectivity in the Hillary v. Bernie race is very telling.  Your laughter with Ashley at the end of your piece was terrible.
@Teegypt @VanJones68 	Are you insane?  CNN is biased for Bernie Sanders. Get a clue.
@VanJones68 @CNN 	You have picked a candidate.  You chose Sanders.  You can keep him!
@moody @CNN You have no idea what you're talking about.  Sanders has no chance of getting nomination and you know it.  Stop lying!
@kasie you make me sick!  Another socialist!  Clinton 2016!
@MarkRuffalo  you bastard! Our future is better under Clinton.
@kasie 	You are no different than Bernie Sanders... Another far left loon.  He can and would never win a national election. Too far left!
@Prof_Kennedy 	You are some piece of work!  Agreeing with Katie Hunt for being totally biased against Hillary Clinton. Shame on you both!
Thanks!
@HAGOODMANAUTHOR @oh4twentysix @JeremyFassler89 @bobcesca_go what facts?  You have no facts.  You support a man who will lose 48 states!
@HAGOODMANAUTHOR 	You are some piece of work!  Bernie Sanders can't win a national election.  The Republicans haven't started on him yet.
@AriMelber 	You really should let your disappointment for Bernie not getting the nomination go. Your article on Clinton makes no difference
@rconniff @ChrisHayesTV 	Go,  fine
@rconniff @ChrisHayesTV 	You really should let the disappointment over Bernie not getting the nomination to.  Hillary will do just find.
@MarkRuffalo  She's on the side of the people.  Too bad you don't recognize that.  Besides,  a B rated actor wouldn't know the difference.
Your appearance on Morning Joe was atrocious. The things you said about the Clintons was truly below the belt.  My PhD says differently.
Your total bias nature against Hillary Clinton and for Sanders is easily seen on TV.  She will win on Tuesday despite you and Romans.
@VictorCNN I find your continued hatred of Secretary Clinton very upsetting. Her honest and trustworthy numbers are just find with me.
@jpwilloughby @HillaryClinton I believe Americans have had enough of you.
@HillaryClinton Please have Hillary go and do town halls with white men and on campuses with students.
Hi.  Just a thought.  In Ohio and other states,  have Hillary meet in town halls with  white men and on the campuses with students.
I am very unhappy with the way you treat Secretary Clinton.  It's quite clear you are a Bernie Sanders supporter.  Go work on his campaign!
@johnpodesta @HillaryClinton hi.  Please stop going on the Andra Mitchell show.  It's quite clear that she doesn't like Hillary.
@HillaryClinton
You are a piece of work!  Your bias is quite evident to to see. Hillary will win Nevada and you can go to hell!
@pRESIDENT_ALIEN @HillaryClinton you are an idiot!
@danaecm @HillaryClinton
Nothing.
