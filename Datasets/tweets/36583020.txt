Pelosi does not have the courage to take a roll call vote
Pelosi "we will be joining those who established Social Security, and Medicare..."doesn't give us much hope all failed systems
Boehner: "We have failed to listen to the will of the people"//
Boehner: " I ask that we never again destroy the trust of the American people"//reflect the will of the American people//
"We break our trust with America, this is the people's House, in a Democracy you can only defy the will of the people so long"//
Boehner: "shame on each and everyone of you who goes against what the people want"
Boehner:  Reps should have the courage to stand in front of the American people and record their voice vote. Speaker says "no"
Boehner:this bill will raise taxes, it defies the will of the American people
Boehner on House floor, bill does not respect all human life. Bill finances tax payer funder abortions.

NEWS FLASH FOR HARRY REID: The REPUBLICAN Party was formed to free the slaves. The first 20 Black Congressmen were REPUBLICANS in 1870
It was the REPUBLICAN party that had the first female Congesswomen (1917) BEFORE she could even vote for herself.
It was the REPUBLICANS who passed the Women's right to vote that was twice vetoed by the Dems,
the REPUBLICANS let by Sen Everett Dirkson who passed the Civil Rights Act, filabustered by the Democrats. Get your history right, Harry!

No one is paying THIS townhall protester to point out the bad policies of the Obama/Pelosi healtcare bill. I can read...
Healthcare REFORM is NOT the same as nationalzing our health care system
Congress just voted to limit the pay of Wall Street workers. Perhaps after the recess, they will vote to limit THEIR OWN pay and benefits!
People don't get it, to "share the load" for healthcare, they must first ask themselves, "when did I last help pay for a perfect stanger?"
