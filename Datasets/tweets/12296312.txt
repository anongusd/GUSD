...“It is time for Congress to ensure that all veterans receive the recognition and care that they deserve.  Many thanks to Senators Boozman and Tester for getting things started again.”
“Women comprise an increasing portion of the veterans population every year.  Their contributions to this country have been overlooked for too long,” said IAVA CEO @JeremyButler01 ...
The Act will would eliminate barriers to care and services that many women veterans face and ensure the VA can address the needs of women veterans, who are more likely than their male peers to face homelessness, unemployment, and lack of access to adequate healthcare services.
US Senators @JohnBoozman (R-AR) and @SenatorTester (D-MT) reintroduced the bipartisan Deborah Sampson Act to support women veterans.  The bill is a result, in large part, from IAVA’s staunch advocacy for women veterans: the She Who Borne the Battle campaign.

“As a veteran &amp; former federal employee, I am painfully aware of the impact this protracted &amp; unnecessary shutdown had on federal employees &amp; their families — many of whom are veterans &amp; continued to serve their country after their tour of duty came to a close." 5/6

We hope that is a message that all Americans hear—especially this weekend on #VeteransDay and throughout #VeteransMonth.” @PaulRieckhoff
Thankfully, some folks like @craignewmark, the founder of craigslist, are stepping up to send big reinforcements. But we’ll need much more and everyone can help.
The tragic shooting on Wednesday underscores the need for RRRP and non-profit programs like it. We ensure that those in our community who need help get the support they need without getting bounced around a fractured system of care.
IAVA’s Rapid Response Referral Program (RRRP) is our premier case management program and our masters-level social workers provide guidance, support and linkages to critical on the ground resources for our nation’s heroes.
Which again highlights the critical importance of seamless access to quality and effective care, whether through the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) or elsewhere.
When veterans w mental health injuries do hurt someone, it’s mostly likely themselves, not someone else. We lose 20 veterans &amp; service members to suicide every single day.
Despite the challenges, and despite the still severely limited resources, post-9/11 veterans are soaring as a population thanks to our core resilience and commitment of men and women who self-select to serve.
“Comments like this 1 from our Commander in Chief are extremely unhelpful. They perpetuate a false &amp; damaging narrative that veterans r broken &amp; dangerous. Most people who suffer from PTSD, when able to access effective treatment, r able to live healthy, happy, meaningful lives.

IAVA will continue fighting to ensure that our nation maintains the best &amp; most qualified force possible &amp; that all vets are properly honored by our nation &amp; the VA. Our platform on promoting equality for all troops &amp; vets can be found on page 67 here: https://t.co/1uOytMkHgY
.@IAVA has also called for an expansion of rights and services for LGBT troops, veterans and their families. For our generation of veterans especially, #equality is a non-partisan pillar of strong national security and true American values. https://t.co/Enwn5YkG4s
We’ve fought for historic change within the Dept of Veterans Affairs (VA) &amp; Defense (DoD). IAVA supported the June 2016 announcement by DoD to allow transgender troops to serve openly without threat of discharge.  https://t.co/Xmixmu2DBq
As a next-generation veteran empowerment, advocacy and support organization, IAVA is proud of its record of standing on the right side of equality issues. https://t.co/iaVhraIlIX
"@IAVA will stand against the transban and any other attempts by any leader of any party to weaken our military, our veterans community or our nation” https://t.co/QD5E1SaNO4
“Diversity makes our national security stronger and the facts back it up. Studies have confirmed that transgender troops are not only serving, but that their open service does nothing to harm readiness." Here is the data: https://t.co/5uw3vS5323
"Especially in an era when so few people step up to serve, no American who is willing and able to wear the uniform should be turned away. Equality is a force-multiplier for our military,” https://t.co/QD5E1SaNO4
"Barring transgender men and women from serving in the military is backward, harmful and contrary to American values. It’s also bad for national security." -@IAVA Founder @PaulRieckhoff
Banning transgender people from service will limit recruitment pools and bar qualified applicants from serving their country with distinction. It’s bad for our military and bad for America. Read the full amicus brief here: https://t.co/qTqmtiepBD

"As VetConnect NYC continues to find its footing as a platform, we encourage this committee to provide them with the oversight and tools they need to be successful." https://t.co/YX2jKijtAY
"Another clear deficit we can see is a lack of a comprehensive case management component. We also view the requirement to use the VetConnect software to participate in the network as a barrier limiting the number and types of programs available through VetConnect NYC."
"I’ve also had the pleasure to work with many at VetConnect NYC and we	have found them to be very responsive and easy to work with, but we have had challenges in seamlessly receiving referrals." #NYC
"This bill does not require the reporting of organizational and programmatic metrics necessary to accurately assess DVS’ performance or	its impact on this city’s veterans." Full testimony at: https://t.co/YX2jKijtAY
"This approach also empowers @IAVA to identify positive and negative trends, and to better document accomplishments to be studied and replicated elsewhere." -@Sneaky_Ghillie See examples at https://t.co/Qa2jUXdk9M and https://t.co/0xe5aOF2we.
"IAVA is a data-driven organization, and as such our view is that when appropriate metrics are applied for measuring program performance and veteran outcomes, services delivered can continue to improve &amp; become more accessible and effective for the target population."
"IAVA supports the intent behind this bill. However it appears that it is somewhat redundant as some of the data is already widely available, and does not require the reporting of necessary metrics to accurately evaluate this Dept's performance &amp; many of its various initiatives."
"Today we voice our concern to the Veterans Committee that Additional Reporting Requirements	for the Dept in their current form do not do enough to measure effectiveness and to ensure	proper oversight of DVS and its programs to include VetConnect NYC." https://t.co/YX2jKijtAY
"DVS has enormous potential &amp; its establishment 2 years ago was a historic moment for vets of NYC. DVS can significantly streamline access &amp; improve service delivery to	many of the most critical vet-specific programs &amp; resources already available here." https://t.co/YX2jKi1Sco

Congress must act to not only bring equality to VA healthcare for women, but also resource-sensible services like childcare. “Access to Quality Care for Our Veterans” should be gender blind, which in the case of supporting single parents, can impact men just as much as women.
IAVA’s #SheWhoBorneTheBattle campaign is focused on righting this wrong and transforming the landscape for women veterans in our country forever. We need to take the American people to a place where women vets are envisioned just as readily as men. https://t.co/YOFhGywcJk #MeToo https://t.co/ESIihiDCqu
Not only do women veterans encounter barriers to care and benefits, they do so in a culture that often does not accept them or fully recognize them as veterans. They also face stunningly high rates of sexual assault. https://t.co/EulXl1TgmH #SheWhoBorneTheBattle #MeToo https://t.co/8gzvn1wp8l
Critical background and data on this trend from our partners at @DAVHQ: https://t.co/Z1W5Cr82uR #SheWhoBorneTheBattle
Though quality of care &amp; services provided by VA for all vets needs to improve, this is particularly critical for women vets. From 2003-2012, women’s use of VA health care services increased 80%, w women vets proportionately using mental health services more intensively than men.
New suicide numbers released last month by the Department of Veterans Affairs showed that in 2016, the suicide rate for women vets was 1.8 higher than for civilians: https://t.co/vYhBD4cURp
Women continue to take on new roles and responsibilities throughout the services. Yet, their service and sacrifice is often overlooked, to their peril. https://t.co/1CpKhQqKU7
Over 345,000 women have deployed since 9/11. While the number of male veterans is expected to decline in the next decades, the population of women veterans will increase. https://t.co/3kk2oOMtXP
"I have raised this issue personally with VA Sec Wilkie, as part of substantive &amp; systemic reforms required to effectively serve women veterans. Updating this motto is about more than words–it is about signaling a commitment to meet the unique needs of our brave women veterans.”
.@SenBlumenthal, a member of the Senate Committee on Veterans' Affairs, added, “I fully support this petition to amend the VA’s outdated motto to honor and recognize the 2 million women veterans who have served and sacrificed for our country."
"...while signage on the wall clearly states that VA is intended only for ‘he who has borne the battle’ instead of all who served and sacrificed for our nation. It is past time for VA to ensure its central message is to care for all those who have borne the battle.” -@TrueBoots
“Too many women veterans seek VA healthcare only as a last resort – or not at all – because they’ve felt harassed, discriminated against, or that their military service was questioned at the VA..." -@TrueBoots
“Women veterans must feel fully welcome at all VA facilities, and that their military service is fully equal to their male counterparts,” said @TrueBoots, Army veteran and Founding Director @NYCVetsAlliance.
A full copy of the petition can be found here: https://t.co/6gxzlxmWX4 @Servicewomen @NYCVetsAlliance @YaleLawSch
This petition asks VA to create a new rule through “notice and comment” that officially updates the motto to be more inclusive. While not guaranteeing change, it requires the Administration and VA take an official position and let the country know where they stand on the issue.
The delivery of the petition is another step in escalating @IAVA’s #SheWhoBornetheBattle campaign, which is focused on transforming the landscape for women veterans in our country forever and includes advocating for passage of the historic and bipartisan Deborah Sampson Act.
“Today, we are proud to join forces with @IAVA and @NYCVetsAlliance to continue to apply pressure on the VA and we will not stop until the motto is changed to reflect the realities of today’s veteran population.”– Dr. Ellen Haring, @Servicewomen CEO
But after 18 months of advocacy, the Administration has failed to take action, and @POTUS continues to be silent on the issue.
.@IAVA has also published an open letter asking the former Secretary to take this meaningful step toward gender equality, and published multiple essays on the cascading impacts of the culture the motto represents. More at https://t.co/YOFhGywcJk.
.@IAVA, backed by dozens of leading allied vets and military organizations, has repeatedly called on the Secretary and VA to modernize its biased motto. IAVA met with both the former and current VA Secretaries and the current Deputy Secretary, to discuss this needed change...
"By finally making this change, President Trump and VA leadership can mark a powerful commitment to creating a culture that acknowledges and respects the service and sacrifices of women veterans.” -@PaulRieckhoff
“The time to act is now. The unveiling of the Women Serve monument at Calverton National Cemetery is an important time to recognize and support women veterans. A long overdue motto change would do the same on the biggest level possible.” - @PaulRieckhoff, @IAVA Founder &amp; CEO
Many of the systemic issues confronting women veterans—inadequate healthcare facilities, mental illness, suicide—relate to a VA culture that does not adequately acknowledge their service and sacrifice. Our members (male and female) have been vocal, consistent and clear on that.
The current VA motto: “To care for him who shall have borne the battle, and for his widow, and his orphan.” The motto is gendered &amp; fails to recognize the sacrifice &amp; service of the over 2M women veterans &amp; their survivors, relegating them to the fringes of the veteran community.
Today, with representation from @YaleLawSch's Veterans Legal Services Clinic, @IAVA, @Servicewomen and @NYCVetsAlliance delivered a “petition for rulemaking” requesting @DeptVetAffairs replace its current outdated and exclusionary motto with one that is inclusive of women.

Congress must act to not only bring equality to VA healthcare for women, but also resource-sensible services like childcare. “Access to Quality Care for Our Veterans” should be gender blind, which in the case of supporting single parents, can impact men just as much as women.
Despite calls from IAVA and dozens of leading allied veterans and military organizations, President Trump has remained silent on calls for the VA to change its motto and support the Deborah Sampson Act. https://t.co/YOFhGywcJk #StormTheHill
This glaring problem is exemplified in the gendered and outdated motto that greets every person, male and female, who walk into the VA: “To care for him who shall have borne the battle and for his widow, and his orphan.” https://t.co/EUIZnQ8SVZ
Improving access to care and benefits while changing the underlying culture to one inclusive of women is imperative to the success of the VA. https://t.co/EUIZnQ8SVZ

“Vets fought for our nation &amp; sustained injuries as a result of their service. Our gov't allowed them to handle weapons, warships &amp; the most incredible tech in the world, but prohibits them from access to cannabis to treat their wounds" said IAVA CEO/Founder, Paul Rieckhoff.
Today, for Day 3 of a historic #StormTheHill grassroots advocacy activation week in Washington, @iava launched a groundbreaking new non-partisan grassroots campaign focused on changing antiquated federal policies that prohibit wounded vets from having access to medical cannabis.

"We invite the President and all concerned citizens to join us next Wednesday on the National Mall to focus awareness, support and action on this silent enemy that is taking the lives of our fellow Americans every single day.”
There’s plenty of urgent news out of Washington this week dominating headlines. This news is a matter of life and death and must not be overlooked. And unlike almost every other issue in Washington, this one could unite leaders of all parties."
"We need reinforcements of the greatest magnitude. We need a national call to action from the top that mobilizes all Americans. In response to this latest VA information, we need immediate action from the Commander-In-Chief, Secretaries of Defense and VA, and all Americans."
“Too many of our men and women are dying”, said Paul Rieckhoff, IAVA Founder and CEO. “Every day, IAVA and our partners and allies are working to support hundreds of thousands of veterans facing transitional challenges after combat. We can’t fight this problem alone."
Vets acct'd for 14% of deaths by suicide in US tho only 8.1% of 18+ population. In 2016, rate of suicide among vets was 1.5x higher than non-vet cohort; Rate for male vets was 1.4x higher than civilian cohort: Rate among women vets was 1.8x. Firearms used in ~70% of vet suicides.

To empower the @Sept11Memorial to continue their critical mission, IAVA calls on Congress to pass the 9/11 Memorial Act (H.R. 6287/S. 3167), which establishes grants to secure the memorial site for millions of visitors. It will be voted on by the full House of Reps this week.
IAVA asks that Americans take time to remember those who were lost during the attacks, servicemembers lost while serving overseas, and those first responders who rushed to the sites of the attacks to recover the injured and the dead, and to educate others, about those sacrifices.

There’s plenty to be upset about in America today. And daily. But this latest attack on our GI Bill should be near the top of your list. Don’t let it get lost in the flurry of other news. Join us, help us fight back and #DefendTheGIBill: https://t.co/uw5N7uMLCC @IAVA #VetsRising
#DefendTheGiBill is a top priority among @IAVA’s #Big6 Advocacy Priorities for 2018–along with combating suicide, #SheWhoBorneTheBattle, reforming the VA, recognizing #BurnPits and other toxic exposures &amp; #CannabisForVeterans: https://t.co/ydHDcxantE https://t.co/2BJCEUdUSq
The GI Bill has been used by +1.5M vets and military family members to accomplish educational goals &amp; chart new career paths. In 2016, @IAVA’s year-long campaign to #DefendtheGIBill had to kill over $4 billion in attempted cuts to the GI Bill by Congress. https://t.co/l0UdbnqIJb
We call on @DeptofDefense to immediately act to rescind this new policy. If they won't, we call on Congress and @POTUS to show courage, stand with our members, and force @DeptofDefense to fix this. https://t.co/y9Znzv5abw #DefendTheGIBill #NoExcuses
Veterans are tired of having to protect the very benefits we were promised when we signed up to serve. Whether the attacks or big or small, we long ago drew a line in the sand. @IAVA WILL NOT not allow our GI Bill to be eroded, cut or dismantled. We will #DefendTheGIBill. https://t.co/0dmdOeMxr9
Here we go again. This is latest change is outrageous–but predictable. Limitations on GI Bill benefits hurt our readiness, hurt our recruitment, hurt morale, and are bad for military families. And once again, it breaks America’s sacred promise with our vets. #DefendTheGIBill https://t.co/sO4ZaxwANZ
Yesterday, @IAVA stood w @NYCVetsAlliance, other leading vets groups &amp; @NYPA Tish James at a NYC press conference to bring focus to #DefendtheGIBill. NY is the home of IAVA’s HQ and has one of the largest student veteran populations in America. https://t.co/wxpaA2VYs4
.@IAVA’s long been a leader on creating, supporting &amp; defending the GI Bill. We call on @DeptofDefense &amp; Sec Mattis to immediately reverse the policy, and put military veterans and their families first, instead of creating barriers to access deserved &amp; transformative benefits. https://t.co/j5Wa0sb6sp
In a time of war, the GI Bill remains critically important to recruit and retain qualified service members, especially with an ever-decreasing pool of eligible recruits. AND it remains essential that our government honor it’s promise to our veterans. #DefendTheGIBill #IAVA #WTF https://t.co/7DiTe89t8B
.@DeptofDefense issued a damaging new policy that will limit the ability of troops to transfer their hard-earned Post-9/11 GI Bill benefits to family members. This restriction impacts troops with more than 16 yrs of service &amp; is an attack on our critical benefit. #DefendtheGIBill https://t.co/KQIJ513XVt
