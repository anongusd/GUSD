@RPatterson4KS @thomasghancock @ILoveHillaryC @cmclymer @BernieSanders Funny how the ‚Äúfree stuff‚Äù you decry is offered by most all other western industrialized economies.  But, yeah, I don‚Äôt understand economics.  Anywho, I‚Äôll pretend my sense of humor is the problem because you‚Äôre a jerk who needs the last word.  Kthxbye
@RPatterson4KS @thomasghancock @ILoveHillaryC @cmclymer @BernieSanders It‚Äôs interesting to hear see a ‚Äúliberal‚Äù throw right-wing talking points at other candidates.  And as much as I hear the term ‚Äúfree stuff‚Äù thrown around, it‚Äôs insulting to think someone voting for progressive policies doesn‚Äôt understand ‚Äúfree stuff‚Äù is paid for by taxes.
Do you ever hear about cities that are supposed to be like ‚Äúthe next big thing‚Äù and then read articles which say stuff like ‚Äúmillennials are starting to move in here a lot!‚Äù  And you just kinda think well yeah fuck me they‚Äôre in their 30s and having kids they ought to be by now
@RPatterson4KS @ILoveHillaryC @cmclymer @BernieSanders Meanwhile, I have Pence in front of me on C-Span spouting vile far-right extremism and I have these people cheering on the failure of whoever may be the 2020 candidate.  Bravo!  Let‚Äôs lose again because you like being pissy about 2016!

@NateSilver538 Re: Black voter turnout.  We‚Äôre only going to keep the AL Senate seat if Kamala or Booker are at the top of the ticket.  Also: way better chances of picking up NC &amp; GA Senate seats.  The other southern Senate seats aren‚Äôt as likely as pickups.

@FissileBolonium @GreyhoundBus @megabus I guess so.  I thought it was so weird.  The greyhound terminal is awful and gross but Megabus kinda outdoes them by using a parking lot as its station üòÇ.  Like really?  At least the Megabus left on time and didn‚Äôt cancel on us.
@FissileBolonium @GreyhoundBus @megabus Yeah ... it was ridiculous.  I wanna encourage him to take Amtrak but it‚Äôs more expensive :-/
@FissileBolonium @GreyhoundBus @megabus Looking for the Megabus stop so we go near the bus shelter near IKEA where I‚Äôve seen the buses before and it‚Äôs not for Philly.  They drop people OFF from there from Philly but you have to board in the back of a department store parking lot.  AND it‚Äôs marked wrong on the GPS.
@FissileBolonium @GreyhoundBus @megabus The most ridiculous part was yesterday when Lo√Øc‚Äôs greyhound was at 9 and it was super late.
