Mahalo to all who are working on this issue. Our team continues to support these efforts in Congress and work on federal legislation, like the WATER Act to upgrade and protect community water systems across the nation. (2/2)
Water resources are a public trust in Hawaiʻi, yet access to water has been monopolized by powerful corporate interests for over a century. It’s time to right these wrongs and ensure access to water is fair and equitable to all. (1/2) https://t.co/WhDAavmMXf
97% of Americans support universal background checks for gun purchases. The passage of this bipartisan common-sense legislation is long overdue to help save lives and make our communities more safe. https://t.co/KiwrpQd6UD

My bill will uphold the #INFTreaty, prevent an escalation of the new Cold War, and protect taxpayer dollars. Rather than scrapping the INF Treaty, we should be working to strengthen &amp; expand it &amp; continue pursuing a path toward security &amp; peace https://t.co/BnNiKxZNgF
President Trump’s actions make the American people and our country less safe, while wasting taxpayer dollars to pay for the new arms race and nuclear weapons -- dollars that should be used to address the needs of our people and communities right here at home.
President Trump’s reckless decision to pull out of the #INFTreaty heightens this threat by exacerbating the new Cold War, sparking a new arms race between the United States and Russia, and bringing us ever closer to a nuclear holocaust.
We face a greater risk of nuclear catastrophe now than ever before in history. The threat of nuclear war is real.
My thoughts and prayers are with the loved ones of the victims of the terrorist attack in Kashmir today. We must stand together to defeat these jihadists and their ideology. https://t.co/PhAfC2vcpr
Thanks to Cathy and Joe from @HawaiiSBDC for the great work they are doing to support small businesses across #Hawaii. Last year alone, they helped 89 business startups, which created 385 jobs, and advised over 1,300 clients, promoting job growth and economic empowerment. https://t.co/TYzioUk9B9
Our legislation will provide the security our working families need to care for their loved ones, without risking their ability to keep a roof over their heads and food on the table.
Without a national family leave policy, millions of Americans are forced to make an impossible choice between their family’s health &amp; financial security.
Across the country, people are working hard every day, living paycheck to paycheck, barely making enough to get by. When a crisis arises, like a parent who falls sick or a personal health crisis, the demands of balancing a job&amp; family needs can be too much https://t.co/d7a87bj6uG

We must reclaim our constitutional responsibility, and stop supporting Saudi Arabia’s genocidal war in Yemen and strengthening the terrorist groups that threaten us.
US-Saudi coalition has dropped bombs on children in schools, people in markets&amp;families celebrating weddings. They've left millions on the brink of death from famine, disease, starvation&amp; lack of access to clean water&amp;health care, creating the world's worst humanitarian crisis
The United States’ support for #Saudi Arabia’s genocidal war in #Yemen, with no authorization from Congress, has resulted in the deaths of tens of thousands of Yemeni civilians. https://t.co/xCnkV3Kozi
That’s why I’m leading legislation to ensure our service members and veterans get the recognition, care, and services they have earned and deserve.
#BurnPits are the Agent Orange of the post-9/11 generation. I’ve seen firsthand the damage caused by burn pits on my brothers&amp;sisters in arms who survived combat &amp; came home, but are now suffering from cancers, lung diseases, neurological disorders &amp; more https://t.co/cpprA3p0d8

We must bring our troops home from Syria quickly &amp; responsibly. Trump’s announced hasty withdrawal from Syria could leave Kurds vulnerable to slaughter by Turkey’s President Erdogan who has repeatedly threatened to attack them &amp; invade Syrian territory long-held by Syrian Kurds

It’s a slap in the face to use veterans &amp; their families as political pawns. Our bipartisan legislation will ensure that Gold Star families won’t have to worry about whether or not they'll be able to afford to pay the rent or put food on the table in the event of a govt shutdown
Our veterans put their lives on the line for our country w/ some paying the ultimate price &amp; their families sacrifice greatly. It's our solemn responsibility to honor them, support their families &amp; ensure their families receive the benefits they’ve earned. https://t.co/KhPemlNuqh
We must ensure that our laws &amp; policies strike the appropriate balance: protecting our national security, while simultaneously ensuring the constitutional rights of Americans are upheld.
There are 2 main things of great importance to the American people: our safety and security &amp; our freedom and civil liberties. It’s unfortunate that some leaders in Washington claim the American people must choose between them. This is a false choice. https://t.co/vLtJ6oyNht
This is not about politics. It's about equality. It's about humanity. It's long overdue that we pass the Equal Rights Amendment and include equality between men and women in the United States Constitution. #ERANow
In the past two years, we've inched forward with successful votes in Nevada and Illinois, and now we're just one state away from finally passing the Equal Rights Amendment.
In 1923, the ERA was introduced to prohibit discrimination on the basis of sex, and was reintroduced every session until it finally passed in 1972. However, because of an arbitrary deadline in 1982, by that time, only 35 states out of the required 38 had ratified the amendment.
There are too many examples in our everyday lives where women still do not get equal pay for equal work and where we still face discrimination simply for being a woman.
It's been nearly 100 years since women fought for and won the right to vote. Yet, we still do not have equal rights and protection under the United States Constitution. https://t.co/QPkMyO5Fat

We cannot allow our government and federal employees to suffer and be held hostage because of partisan politics or policy disagreements.
This deal to reopen the government for 21 days will provide backpay for federal employees, and allow them to go back to work while Democrats &amp; Republicans work together to address funding levels and authorities for border security and immigration concerns. https://t.co/RiAxQ7qyAT
I heard from a federal employee who held a garage sale last week,selling as much as she could to pay her rent. Another in the Army Reserves told me if the govt doesn’t open by February, he’d be forced to volunteer to deploy to Afghanistan for a paycheck to care for his wife&amp; kids
For 33 days, the federal government has failed its citizens. Over 800,000 federal employees have been furloughed or are working without pay. https://t.co/Bf8sIruzki
Our bipartisan legislation will help ensure that nurses in #Hawaii and across the country have the education, training, and support they need to continue their service. https://t.co/wNDfrpWpZE
Too often, nurses are unsung heroes who provide life-saving care to our communities in the most trying times. As our country faces an aging population, increase in chronic diseases, opioid epidemic &amp; more, our healthcare workers must have the support needed to care for our people
I’m honored to join Joaquin’s parents, loved ones and many more who have built this movement to protect our children and help to prevent future tragedies like this. We must take action today, in honor of Joaquin and thousands more lost to gun violence, and protect our communities
The horrific tragedy that occurred at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School left 17 dead, 17 injured &amp; a nation of broken hearts in its wake. Too many parents, like Manuel &amp; Patricia, never knew they were saying their final goodbyes &amp; last hugs &amp; kisses with their sons &amp; daughters https://t.co/rUWuSiKI43
Today, my colleague and fellow veteran, @repbrianmast, and I are reintroducing burn pit legislation, joined by Senator @amyklobuchar and @Sendansullivan, to make sure they get the services they have earned.
In Iraq, the cloud of toxic smoke &amp; fumes from the burn pit in our camp was a daily reality. I know the damage they cause. I've seen the devastating toll taken on my brothers &amp; sisters in arms who survived combat &amp; came home, but now suffer from rare cancers, lung diseases &amp; more
So far, our government has failed to fulfill its responsibility to them &amp; recognize the toxins they have been exposed to -- just like what happened to our Vietnam veterans decades ago when our government ignored their exposure and the ensuing illnesses that came from #AgentOrange
Over 165,000 veterans have registered their names in the voluntary Burn Pit Registry, but there are millions of our troops who've been exposed to these toxic burn pits during their deployment. They deserve recognition. They deserve care &amp; they deserve the services they've earned.
#BurnPits are the Agent Orange of post 9/11 veterans. https://t.co/PSQ5gNRmnI
Senator McConnell and President Trump must pass the House’s bipartisan legislation and re-open the government now. https://t.co/pveG18fvos
Although our nation’s leaders have failed to step up, everyday Americans haven’t hesitated to take this charge, share their aloha, and care for each other. We cannot  allow our people to shoulder the government’s responsibility to function.
Senator McConnell and President Trump continue to put politics before their responsibilities to serve the American people, leaving our working people unable to pay medical bills, afford their rent and mortgage, and put food on the table for their children.
Hundreds of thousands of federal employees across our country are scrambling to make ends meet as a result of this reckless, 26 day-long government  shutdown. https://t.co/qS6q0nshPZ
We passed funding that's sorely-needed by communities like mine, where people are still struggling to get back on their feet w/ limited resources. This bill provides funding for crop insurance, water infrastructure projects, crisis counseling, rebuilding houses &amp; small businesses
But time and again, in #Hawaii and across the country, people have proved their resilience and strength and living aloha, taking care of each other even when they have lost everything.
We were battered by natural disasters of all types last year on nearly all of our islands – from major flooding and landslides on #Kauai and #Oahu in April, an erupting volcano throughout May and June, and flooding and wildfires on multiple islands in August.
In other parts of the country, there were storms and hurricanes that similarly devastated other communities. My home state of #Hawaii was one of them.
2018 was a tough year for so many Americans. We had families and farmers and people all across #California whose homes were destroyed, people who lost their lives, lost their farms, lost their businesses. https://t.co/ABmNMklUlm
We cannot turn our backs on our brothers and sisters. These are real people, real families, real lives, and real futures. @senatemajldr and @realDonaldTrump must pass the bipartisan legislation we have already passed and re-open the government now.
Food stamps for tens of millions of Americans are at risk. Low-income housing subsidies are impacting over 340,000 elderly and disabled veterans who depend on that rental assistance. The safety and security of our country is at risk.
Our national parks are filling with trash, our Coast Guard members are working without pay, being told they should hold garage sales or start babysitting to help pay for the bills while the government is shut down.
I heard recently from Jay from #Maui, who's a TSA employee who has been working this entire time without pay, wondering how he's going to pay his mortgage, car, and credit card payments and life-saving medical care that he needs to provide for his daughter. Jay is not alone.
It's been 25 days -- 25 days since over 800,000 federal employees have either been going to work without pay or have been furloughed, all of them wondering, ‘How am I going to pay my rent or my mortgage? How am I going to afford the bills to take care of my family?’ https://t.co/3l3dgK1HMI
We must build on progress made in #Hawaii and keep this toxic chemical out of our air, food, and water, and hold industrial agri-businesses accountable for endangering our people and our planet. https://t.co/REHt9U2xOg
We cannot put a price tag on the health and lives of our people. The use of chlorpyrifos puts the health and well-being of our keiki, expecting mothers, field workers, agricultural communities, and our 'aina and wai at risk.
The people of #Kauai suffered the painful consequences of chlorpyrifos being used in our community, where dozens of workers were hospitalized from exposure to this dangerous pesticide.
I stand in solidarity w/ our working people &amp; will continue to fight for them. We cannot wait another day when so much is on the line --the stakes are too high. The Senate needs to pass our bipartisan legislation to reopen the govt &amp; President Trump needs to sign it into law. https://t.co/O9boEJdPTf
It is costing taxpayers every day the government is shut down, causing suffering and hardship for families all across the country, and it is making our country less safe. https://t.co/WAi4ehZq8Y
These workers are the backbone of our community, providing essential services that ensure our safety, security, and wellbeing. This shutdown is politics at its worse. https://t.co/wMeTX3HmG3
Tomorrow, hundreds of thousands of federal employees in #Hawaii &amp; across the country will not receive a paycheck because of this senseless government shutdown. They are suffering and struggling, worrying about how to pay medical bills, rent, mortgage and other necessary expenses https://t.co/annP2uPBWA
Under current law, vets are being shortchanged, failing to receive their full retirement &amp; disability benefits they've earned. This is ridiculous &amp; can't be allowed to continue. Our bipartisan legislation will ensure that our vets receive the benefits they’ve earned &amp; deserve
Our veterans have dedicated their lives in service to our country &amp; should not be penalized for that service due to a bureaucratic rule. Retirement benefits and disability benefits are two different things, and one should not be counted against the other. https://t.co/xnGlxCwxwP
Congress must end its support for Saudi Arabia’s genocidal war in Yemen, exercise our constitutional authority over matters of war&amp; stop putting profits of the military-industrial complex before the lives of the American people &amp; people around the world https://t.co/S1fnDevvSy
Here we are 100 days later and this Congress still refuses to take action to stop U.S. support for Saudi Arabia and to stop arms sales to Saudi Arabia.
They spend billions of dollars spreading the extreme Wahhabi Salafist ideology that fuels terrorist groups like ISIS and Al Qaeda around the world. Contrary to what @POTUS believes, Saudi Arabia is not our friend.
Since 2015, the United States has supported Saudi Arabia’s genocidal war in #Yemen that has killed tens of thousands of civilians, caused millions of Yemeni people to suffer, starve, and get sick, and created the worst humanitarian crisis in the world.
This brought the world’s attention to #SaudiArabia, a radical Wahhabi theocracy, where the oppression of women and the persecution of Christians, Hindus, atheists, and other religious minorities, as well as the LGBT community is the norm.
100 days ago today, the Saudi regime ordered the assassination of a journalist named Jamal Khashoggi. https://t.co/ssxeV4hEqI
Our legislation makes progress toward ensuring quality healthcare for all Americans. https://t.co/xtulJbfsqa
They’ve managed to buy access into Congress, barring the govt from negotiating cheaper prices for consumers, so they can price-gouge those trying to buy life-saving medication&amp; rake in profits at the expense of the American people.
No one should be forced to choose between putting food on the table and paying for life-saving medication. But that’s exactly what’s happening to millions of Americans as a result of big pharma’s chokehold on Medicare.
Our veterans deserve better than added stress &amp; financial hardship due to the VA's incompetence &amp; bureaucratic red tape. This law that I helped introduce will hold the VA accountable &amp; ensure that our veterans receive the benefits they've earned &amp; deserve. https://t.co/FQEQzb5J6I

I successfully secured much-needed research and development funding to help #Hawaii farmers fight back against the macadamia felted coccid that has destroyed farms and threatened the livelihoods of dozens of communities, especially on Hawai‘i Island.
This bill has finally opened the door for industrial hemp — a domestic industry that already has a market value of roughly $620 million in the U.S. per year — creating great opportunity for sustainable jobs across many sectors.
It protects food stamps that nearly 170,000 of our keiki, kūpuna, vets &amp; working families across Hawaii rely on, invests in ag &amp; rural development, conservation efforts to protect our air, land &amp; water, clean energy programs, &amp; assistance for vets, indigenous &amp; low-income farmers

It also invests in Impact Aid schools, and Hawai‘i’s 15 community health centers that provide service for rural communities &amp; those most in need. Our families across Hawaii face many challenges - we must put their well-being before politics &amp; find ways to deliver results for them
It provides a pay raise for our servicemembers, support for disaster recovery, funding for critical missile defense programs, including Hawaii’s Homeland Defense Radar, burn pits research for our veterans, opioid prevention and treatment, and more.
While I have concerns about some provisions in this legislation, ultimately this bipartisan funding bill will take care of our troops and help provide essential services for the people of #Hawaii and across the country. https://t.co/GQt8HCSdEl
Our bipartisan legislation makes a necessary technical fix to existing law &amp; provides access to ID cards, which will make it easier to apply for healthcare services, buy or rent a home, get a quality education &amp; more, relieving uncertainty for COFA migrants who call Hawai‘i home
This legislation rights a wrong to ensure that tens of thousands of COFA migrants living in the United States, including more than 17,000 in #Hawaii, are able to access the services they need, empowering themselves and their families. https://t.co/JC0mF5IyR2
This funding will be available to support ongoing efforts to repair damaged farms and homes, revitalize our communities, and assist those affected in getting back on their feet.
Despite all of our challenges, the strength and resilience we continue to see from the people in our communities is inspiring, as neighbors help neighbors, share their aloha, and pull together to recover from devastation.
This funding is essential to communities like ours that have been challenged in so many ways, with very limited resources to help with relief, recovery, and rebuilding.
The people of #Hawaii have been hit especially hard by natural disasters this year from major flooding on #Kauai and #Oahu in April, volcanic eruptions on Hawai‘i Island &amp; the recent flooding &amp; wildfires on multiple islands related to Tropical Storm Lane. https://t.co/w8lUSKO6AU https://t.co/yXZ4UzDvLb
It is long overdue time for Congress to reassert its role and responsibility provided within the Constitution, and end our illegal support for Saudi Arabia's war now.
Even after Saudi Arabia dropped a bomb on a school bus that killed 40 children last month, the Trump Administration reaffirmed its support for this illegal war—reportedly to avoid jeopardizing a $2 billion arms deal with Saudi Arabia and the UAE.
For too long, the US has supported Saudi Arabia, turning a blind eye to the horrifying atrocities committed against millions of Yemeni civilians since the start of this genocidal war in 2015. 	https://t.co/emkW1lnjCp
Based on our country’s continued counterproductive regime-change war policies, it's clear that leaders on both sides of the aisle haven't learned the painful lessons of decades of interventionist regime-change wars most recently in Iraq, Libya &amp; now Syria. https://t.co/pvzyQYJG2z

It is a blatant violation of the Constitution, the War Powers Resolution, and U.S. law. Congress must re-assert its authority and take immediate action to prevent yet another illegal, costly, counterproductive Presidential war.
This is a complete betrayal of those killed on 9/11, first responders, our troops who were killed or injured in the fight against terrorism, and their families.
Trump’s Administration has threatened “dire consequences” against Syria, Russia, and Iran if they attack al-Qaeda and other terrorist groups who control the city of Idlib, Syria.
This week, as we honor the lives lost when al-Qaeda attacked our country 17 years ago on 9/11, the Trump Administration is threatening to start World War III in order to protect al-Qaeda in #Syria.

Last month, the Saudi-led coalition dropped a US-made bomb on a school bus that killed 40 children—the latest in a long string of horrors in this genocidal war that has killed thousands of Yemeni civilians w/ bombs &amp; mass starvation, creating the world’s worst humanitarian crisis
For too long, the United States has turned a blind eye to the atrocities being committed against civilians in #Yemen by the Saudi-U.S. coalition.

Our bipartisan resolution aims to end presidential wars, and hold Congress accountable so it does its job in making the serious and costly decision about whether or not to send our nation’s sons and daughters to war.
Since 9/11 alone, our country has spent trillions of dollars on interventionist regime change wars, costing the lives of many Americans, taking a toll on our veterans, and causing people in our communities to struggle and suffer due to a lack of resources.
For decades, Congress has ceded its Constitutional responsibility of deciding whether or not to declare war, to the President. As a result, we have found ourselves in a state of perpetual war, without a declaration of war by Congress and without input from the American people.

@RepHanabusa This legislation has the potential to save people’s lives in #Hawaii - states like Pennsylvania and New Jersey that have adopted similar policies have seen addiction rates drop and opioid abuse deaths decrease by over 20%.
@RepHanabusa With such a stark increase in prescription #opioid use and dependence, heroin and synthetic drug overdose, and emergency room visits over the last decade, we must allow legal access to medical marijuana to help prevent opioid addiction and opioid-related deaths.
@RepHanabusa We are in the middle of an ongoing opioid epidemic in this country and #Hawaii is on the front lines – there are 191 drug-related deaths per year, as well as almost 500,000 active opioid prescriptions, which is enough to serve a third of our population.

Once again, Congress has passed legislation that puts corporate profits before the wellbeing of the American people. We must work towards real reform that strengthens food security, supports farmers, protects health and safety &amp; preserves our environment for generations to come
According to a 2017 report, #Hawaii needs an estimated $1.05 billion in drinking water investment over the next 20yrs to ensure safe water for our people. This farm bill would fail to address water &amp; wastewater infrastructure needs in rural communities
It would cut the budget for food stamps, that nearly 170,000 #Hawaii residents depend on, by over $23 billion, putting our low-income keiki, kūpuna, and working families at risk.
Instead, this #FarmBill rewards mega-agribusinesses, while slashing funding for rural ag development&amp; clean energy programs, cutting key efforts critically needed to help fight invasive species like the coffee berry borer, macadamia felted coccid, and more.
Passing a strong bipartisan #FarmBill is a great opportunity to better the lives of working families, empower millions of local farmers, &amp; strengthen agricultural opportunities nationwide.

Our bill will help ensure that Hawaiʻi’s nurses and future nurses get the support they need to continue to serve our communities across the state. https://t.co/gVKQYGbcPv

There are many kinds of natural disaster that can impact our islands. Because of their level of devastation or frequency of occurrence, our top three hazards are hurricanes, tsunamis, and flashfloods. That’s why it’s important to always be prepared: https://t.co/k0w4IpQkQ1

In #Hawaii alone, the macadamia felted coccid costs our local farmers, landowners &amp; agriculture industry millions of dollars a year. Very little is known about this invasive pest, making it difficult for our farmers and agriculture industry to fight back. https://t.co/zpuBv42pZs

I’m calling on Congress to support my #NDAA Amendment 106 to uphold Congress’s responsibility and constitutional role to declare war, and ensure the American people have a real debate on any declaration that affects their safety and security https://t.co/2tVtZe29rP
Recklessly passing Section 1225 also dumps more taxpayer dollars in costly, counterproductive wars instead of investing in rebuilding our communities right here at home https://t.co/2tVtZe29rP
This dangerous provision gives total authority to the Administration to keep US troops in the Middle East, as long as they deem necessary- an intention clearly stated by the warhawks of this Administration like Nikki Haley, John Bolton, and Mike Pompeo. https://t.co/2tVtZdKy3f
Section 1225 gives after-the-fact license for what is already happening in the Middle East, like ongoing US support of Saudi in #Yemen &amp; our role in #Syria. These heartbreaking wars have created millions of refugees &amp; left death, destruction &amp; great human suffering in their wake
It lacks a clear objective or goal for our troops to achieve, circumvents Congress’s constitutional responsibility to declare war, and provides unending authorization to ‘counter Iran.’  https://t.co/2tVtZe29rP
Make no mistake—the authorization in Section 1225 of the #NDAA authorizes our military to go to war with Iran. https://t.co/069StLtl1t

Our bipartisan legislation will evaluate exposure to burn pits and other hazardous airborne chemicals to ensure our servicemembers and veterans receive the treatment and services they earned and deserve. https://t.co/xhEoXsbWAN
Some veterans who I deployed with are now falling sick with cancer &amp; other illnesses. But, there is no research and data about exposure to burn pits &amp; other toxic chemicals, and how they have impacted the health and well-being of our servicemembers and their families.
Whether serving in Iraq or Afghanistan, our post-9/11 veterans were exposed to open-air burn pits, often for many hours a day.

“I call upon @POTUS to resist the loud calls of war and instead wield the power of the Presidency to help bring peace to the people of Syria, their devastated country, and the region.”
“Here is the bottom line: If our desire is for peace&amp;stability in Syria &amp; to mitigate the suffering of the Syrian people so they can begin to rebuild their communities &amp; enable refugees to return home, then we should work for peace, rather than expanding &amp; escalating the war"
“A U.S. military attack against Syria will expand and escalate this war, increasing their suffering and causing more death, more refugees, and fewer resources to invest in rebuilding our own communities right here at home.”
“If @POTUS is truly concerned about the suffering of the Syrian people, then he must do all he can to bring about peace."
“US military action against Syria will simply escalate &amp; prolong the war, resulting in more senseless death, destruction&amp; suffering. A US military attack against Syria will certainly reinvigorate&amp; resurrect the terrorizing forces of jihad &amp; increase refugees into Europe &amp; the US”

We can’t ignore these glaring vulnerabilities in our electoral infrastructure that continue to erode voter confidence &amp; leave our country and our democracy open to manipulation by adversaries.

I urge my colleagues to honor the millions of Americans who submitted comments, made calls, and protested the repeal of #NetNeutrality by joining this national movement to demand open, fair, and equal Internet access for all.
With the vast majority of Americans strongly supporting net neutrality protections, Congress must take action now.  We are one vote away in the Senate and a handful of votes away in the House from reversing the @FCC’s wrongheaded decision.
The @FCC’s corporate-backed repeal of #NetNeutrality has handed the levers of the Internet over to industry giants—giving these companies power to stifle access, deciding how much to charge people to visit certain websites, &amp; making it impossible for small businesses to compete.
Across the country, students, entrepreneurs, working families, and millions more rely on the Internet to access education, healthcare, employment, opportunity, and so much more.

Our legislation will ensure the lessons learned from Hawaii’s false alert are used to identify and fix preparedness gaps nationwide.
Along with providing Hawaii’s people with timely answers into what went wrong and why, we also need to investigate the gaps that exist at home and across the country that could trigger or perpetuate future emergencies.
Given the threats we face and the vulnerabilities that have been exposed, there are serious changes that need to take place at the federal, state, and local levels to ensure this kind of colossal failure never happens again.
The false ballistic missile alert sent out across Hawai‘i corroded public trust and revealed gaps in preparedness measures at every level of government.

For five years, our federal government ensured protection for financial institutions doing business with state-licensed marijuana-related businesses, only to face a complete reversal of policy under the Trump Administration.

The American people have made it clear they support net neutrality, and we must do all that we can to empower their voices &amp; protect their rights to fairness and equality. Congress must reject the @FCC's corporate-backed vote &amp; restore net neutrality.
Instead, the @FCC chose to help line the pockets of big corporations and Internet Service Providers (ISPs) who can afford to pay to play.

Our bipartisan legislation will end this unnecessary and costly debate once and for all by federally decriminalizing marijuana and kick-starting long overdue, common sense criminal justice reform.
I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 1227, the Ending Federal Marijuana Prohibition Act, which would decriminalize marijuana by removing it from the federal controlled substances list, treating it the same as alcohol and tobacco.
Our laws should accurately reflect scientific consensus – not misplaced stigma and outdated myths about marijuana.
By continuing to pour billions of dollars down the drain w/ our archaic marijuana policies, we stifle our economy, society, &amp; criminal justice system&amp; leave the people of Hawai‘i and millions more devastated –all for a substance that is far less dangerous and harmful than alcohol
Taxpayer dollars would be better spent tackling the many problems that plague the American people including combating the opioid epidemic, ensuring affordable housing, repairing aging infrastructure, and investing in education, healthcare, veterans’ care, and more.
This decision reinforces our outdated and destructive policies on marijuana that turn everyday Americans into criminals, tear families apart, and waste billions of taxpayer dollars to arrest, prosecute, and incarcerate people for nonviolent marijuana charges.
This overreach by the federal government undermines state governments like Hawaii’s that have legalized medical marijuana and threatens the livelihoods and rights of the people of #Hawaii and those of the 29 states and Washington DC who have legalized some form of marijuana.
Attorney General Sessions' reversal of the current non-interference policy that essentially allowed states to implement their own marijuana laws without federal interference, tramples on states’ rights and is a dangerous escalation of the failed so-called War on Drugs.

In #Hawaii and across the country, spending on our criminal justice system continues to increase, yet over 40% of people released from prison return within 3 years. https://t.co/1OZV6m3gDk
According to @HawaiiPSD, #Hawaii spends about $140 per prison inmate per day, which includes program services, food, health care, and administrative costs. That comes out to $51,100 per year per prisoner locked up in Hawaiʻi, more than a year’s salary for many people in Hawaiʻi
Our criminal justice system is broken &amp; unsustainable, both for our government and society. Our prison population is rising—30 years ago in #Hawaii, our prison population was under 1,000. Last year, it was over 5,500, including 1,300 sent to Arizona because of prison overcrowding

Keeping the Internet open and accessible to all should not be a partisan issue – it's an American issue. It should be the level playing field that lets the little guy compete against industry giants without being silenced or muffled.

This legislation is a disappointment, and a lost opportunity to truly help millions of Americans in need.
As long as Congressional leaders continue to pass legislation for partisan political reasons, where lobbyists have more input in writing this legislation than many Members of Congress, with no effort whatsoever to enact true bipartisan reform, in the end, the American people lose
In #Hawaii, where the average cost of a single-family home is well over $700,000, lowering the mortgage interest deduction means many local families will find it even more difficult to achieve their dreams of homeownership, as the cost of living continues to rise.
While industry giants see the largest corporate tax cut in American history made permanent, 86 million low and middle class families will pay higher taxes in eight years than they do today.
It should be no surprise that with this legislation, the top 1% in our country will receive over 82 percent of the tax benefit.
This tax bill was written by &amp; for lobbyists &amp; the corporations who sign their paychecks, without consideration of the lasting impact on low-income and middle-class families who are struggling just to make ends meet -the reality for so many #Hawaii families &amp; millions more.
#ICYMI: Rep. Tulsi Gabbard Votes Against Partisan Corporate-Handout Tax Bill, Again https://t.co/KH8oiXVYPU
I oppose this legislation today. It's a disappointment and a huge lost opportunity to actually help so many struggling families all across the country.
As long as Congress continues to pass legislation for political reasons that serve corporate interests instead of families that are struggling to get by every day, where lobbyists have more input in writing this legislation than many Members of Congress, the American people lose.
For example, the top one percent in our country will receive over 82 percent of the entire tax benefit in the bill they passed today.
But rather than passing a strong, inclusive, and bipartisan bill focused on helping hardworking middle-class families, today Republicans passed a bill filled with massive corporate giveaways and loopholes for the ultra-wealthy.
There's no doubt the American people need and want real tax reform.

We cannot continue to stand idly by as parents and families stay up at night worrying how to pay for the healthcare of our country’s children. Congress must ensure the health and well-being of our future leaders—our children—and extend CHIP funding immediately.
If Congress fails to act, #Hawaii will exhaust its CHIP funding by the end of this month, leaving thousands of children unable to visit a doctor for routine checkups, receive immunizations, prescriptions, emergency services, and more.
Coupled with Medicaid, these programs have played a fundamental role in lowering the uninsured rate among children down to a record low of 4.5 percent.

@HHSGov With 91 lives lost every single day to the opioid epidemic, Acting Secretary Hargan should immediately authorize additional research into medical marijuana as an alternative treatment to urgently address this opioid crisis.
@HHSGov In #Hawaii alone, hospitalizations, emergency room visits, and opioid-related deaths have doubled over the last decade. Studies have found a correlation in states that have legalized medical marijuana with a drop in addiction rates and opioid abuse deaths, some by over 20%.
@HHSGov As the opioid epidemic continues to ravage communities across the country, we must pursue every available path to prevent, treat, and ultimately end America’s reliance on these highly addictive drugs.

Our bipartisan legislation cuts through the bureaucratic red tape for nearly 30,000 medically retired veterans with disabilities, empowering them to make informed choices on their coverage, while removing penalties and roadblocks to quality healthcare.
Our veterans put their lives on the line for our country. Many carry both visible and invisible wounds of war long after they lay down their uniform. Their service should never limit their access to quality healthcare, and the ability to make their own decisions about their care.

As Congress goes to conference committee on the current tax proposals and moves closer towards a final vote, I will continue to ensure my constituents’ concerns are heard and stand against this wrong-headed legislation.
Our telephone townhall was an important opportunity to share the facts about what is at stake for the people of #Hawaii under the Republican tax proposals, as well as to share critical information and resources for #Hawaii taxpayers ahead of the upcoming tax season.
Both the House and Senate have passed tax reform proposals that would provide little to no relief through temporary cuts for some in the middle class, while corporations get huge permanent tax cuts and more handouts.
#Hawaii families are rightfully concerned about the corporate-giveaway tax bills being rushed through Congress. There is no doubt that our tax code needs reform - but it should be done in a way that is bipartisan, and that strengthens working families.

@RepDeSantis @RepKathleenRice @MarshaBlackburn @repjimcooper Our bipartisan legislation will empower survivors by increasing transparency and accountability, and providing survivors the freedom to publicly share their stories if they so choose, regardless of the non-disclosure agreements they were forced to sign.

This is wrong and must be corrected immediately. No more excuses. Members of Congress who harass their staffers must be held personally and financially responsible for their actions, and the public should be informed of their behavior.
Congress must take action now to address this pervasive problem. It is outrageous that hard-working American taxpayers have paid the bill for offending lawmakers’ harassment settlements totaling millions of dollars, while keeping the names of these predators secret.
No one, whether it be a Capitol Hill staffer, Hollywood actor, schoolteacher, or soldier, or any other profession, should have to choose between their job and their personal safety, security, and privacy.
For too long, victims of sexual assault and harassment have been shamed and bullied into silence, perpetuating an inexcusable culture that has no place in our country.

Under this #TaxBill corporate tax cuts are made permanent, while individual tax cuts are temporary, with many middle class families seeing their taxes increase in 10 years.
#Hawaii public school teachers spend hundreds of dollars of their own money every year buying supplies for their students. The #TaxBill passed today gets rid of the deduction they currently have to help with these out of pocket expenses, further driving down their take home pay
House-passed #TaxBill would strip clean energy incentives driving innovation in the Aloha State &amp; nationwide, while maintaining over $14 billion in federal subsidies for the fossil fuel industry. This is exactly the wrong direction for our country
Deductions for major medical expenses, affecting roughly 33,000 people in #Hawaii are eliminated from the #TaxBill, creating a disproportionate impact on our kupuna and those most vulnerable already struggling to pay for the skyrocketing cost of medical care
Under GOP #TaxBill, over 45,000 #Hawaii students would lose the deductions they can take for student loan interest rates, burying them deeper into debt
Almost everyone can agree that we desperately need tax reform, but the #TaxBill passed by the House today is not the way to achieve it. I voted against this bill, which provides a windfall for corporate interests, leaving behind everyone else

#AHCAfail is good news! It was a corporate giveaway for insurance &amp; big pharma. We need real healthcare reform — people before profits.
Your voices make a difference! Hawaii constituent calls on #AHCA: 208 oppose, 3 support. Glad this bill was pulled from House floor today.
While reforms to our healthcare system are sorely needed, we need a system that actually serves the wellbeing of people over corporations
Medicare &amp; Medicaid cover close to 570,000 people in #Hawaii. We can't afford to slash funding for healthcare of our most vulnerable
We need a healthcare system that puts people over profits. #AHCA does the opposite- I'm strongly urging my colleagues to vote no. https://t.co/nk6HpNEGrw
