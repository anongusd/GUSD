@reagan_values I‚Äôve barely been active on Twitter in a while.
@reagan_values Thank you. I‚Äôve had people tell me, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôll give an advantage to criminals.‚Äù Correction: It‚Äôll give an advantage to the accused* just like the presumption of innocence and the burden of proof.
Oh my pleasure. https://t.co/9z8J60zQ9z
@reagan_values Lol it‚Äôs no problem.
@reagan_values ü§£
@reagan_values Glad we agree. A right to a jury of your peers (and that jury be required to be convinced COMPLETELY of your guilt before taking your liberty) is as much a protection from the misuse of government power as the 2nd amendment is.
@reagan_values We‚Äôre currently one of 2 states not to do so. The other is Oregon.
@reagan_values Oh just to clarify, the original tweet was in reference to a proposed constitutional amendment in Louisiana requiring unanimous juries for non-capital felony convictions (and acquittals).
@reagan_values Oh that‚Äôs a totally different discussion lol
@reagan_values ‚ÄúThe most transcendent privilege which any subject can enjoy, or wish for, that he cannot be affected either in his property, his liberty, or his person, but by the unanimous consent of twelve of his neighbours and equals.‚Äù

What is the government's role (specifically Louisiana's) in licensing occupations? #LSUDebateNight18
What is your (anyone on the panel's) position on birthright citizenship? #LSUDebateNight18

When we try, we usually end up doing something silly like setting market values, regulating industries we know nothing about, or categorizing people. Have we been warned by stories from the past against such behavior?
The hero separates chaos and order, but allows (as if he has a choice) them both to exist. The balance of both is the basis for spontaneous order (in economic terms and otherwise). Spontaneous order is order naturally derived from chaos. No individual can do that.
Is this an attempt to fly too close to the Sun? How many ancient and contemporary stories warn us not to try to play God? And yet we have the arrogance to try to construct utopian theories (or at the very least set market values) and try to implement them.
This insistence that nothing can be ‚Äútrue‚Äù (in the sense of its meaningfulness and metaphorical utility) without being grounded entirely in empirical fact could possibly be what leads us to attempt to construct entirely empirical world-views and societal structures.
Maybe because we need understandable representations of these truths to know how to live. Why else is it that every hero story (most of art, fiction, religion, etc.) says something so much deeper than the literal events of the plot?
It is likely that religion, mythology, drama, etc. are all the result of a billions-of-years long game of ‚Äútelephone‚Äù, but one in which ultimate truths remained. Because there‚Äôs something about these truths that attracts and fascinate us.

@LibertarianBlue @ezralevant They still need to categorize. A set market share, great. But a market share of what? Of anything? Or do we have to categorize it?
@LibertarianBlue @ezralevant Well they did. They didn‚Äôt apply, but government‚Äôs obsession with categorization and incumbent firms came together as a direct result and, in many areas, stifled innovation. You‚Äôve been to NYC. I live in New Orleans. Regs on incumbent firms give them a weapon against new ones.
@LibertarianBlue @ezralevant I hope you know I have a lot of respect for you and don't mean to come across as combative. I think this is a conversation conservatives have to have.
@LibertarianBlue @ezralevant Not to mention we put the government in charge of defining censorship. Right now we're dealing with private censorship. You set a precedent and give the government that power, and we're dealing with a whole different ball-game.
@LibertarianBlue @ezralevant And I know what you're going to say: "But they're not finding a way." There will be a response from the public about that, as there is. The problem is the temptation to legislate, which both companies and consumers feel. It's the path of least resistance.
@LibertarianBlue @ezralevant And as a general concept, I would rather be "forced" to do something with money than by the point of a gun. As a libertarian, I would rather allow companies to find their own ways to please their customers without the alluring temptation of partnership with the government.
@LibertarianBlue @ezralevant This brings us back to categorization. What happens when our main source of information changes (as it will) and advertisers operate differently? Do we regulate the next wave of firms? Or do we just make a law that private firms have to uphold the 1st amendment?
@LibertarianBlue @ezralevant I'm failing to see the problem. Don't get me wrong. I understand the concern. I'm a conservative who uses YouTube. I would say (correct me if I'm wrong) that your main concern is that Google, YouTube, etc. are large enough to be considered public forums. Is that correct?
@LibertarianBlue @ezralevant They get off the hook with advertisers, and the advertisers go elsewhere. Unless we regulate the advertisers too.
@LibertarianBlue @ezralevant It‚Äôs a never-ending cycle that stifles innovation. As someone who aligns with you on many issues, I‚Äôm just urging not to fall into that trap.
@LibertarianBlue @ezralevant A smaller example: we regulate cab companies. They have to be licensed, pay fees, etc. Ridesharing comes along, does a better job, and cab companies say it‚Äôs unfair that they don‚Äôt have to pay the same fees. Then gov has to redefine (badly) an industry and regulate it.
@LibertarianBlue @ezralevant They‚Äôre not the same, but serve the same purpose. I‚Äôm just explaining creative destruction, which I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôre familiar with. I guarantee you the firms you‚Äôre talking about will support and help write their own regulations. They help them, not hurt them.
@LibertarianBlue @ezralevant Well aware. What I‚Äôm saying is that market shares change faster than laws do. And my main issue is with your use of the term ‚Äúcategory.‚Äù Who sets the categories? Who decides who to put into which?
@LibertarianBlue Exceptions in the heat of lost revenue are what make us support decisions we later come to regret. They‚Äôre hostile to free speech, but so are many of the people to which you‚Äôre entrusting their regulation, and those people have guns.
@LibertarianBlue I think we recognize the same problem. I attended Breitbart‚Äôs event in Metairie, LA on this issue. My problem is with some of the solutions presented. Is the internet the one exception to our insistence that gov should stay out of business? Does it not present the same dangers?
@LibertarianBlue @ezralevant What‚Äôs a small startup? Do you want to leave that decision to elected officials or Zuckerberg and the like? I trust neither. The market is usually the better alternative.
@LibertarianBlue @ezralevant Only google, in practice, for now. Remember there was a time where most Americans thought AOL was the only way to access the internet. Times change. It won‚Äôt be another search engine that kills Google, but something slightly different that serves the same need. See Lyft and Uber.
@LibertarianBlue @ezralevant Then you have to start categorizing businesses, which is something govs have historically had a hard time with. You have to define ‚Äútech startup,‚Äú ‚Äúsearch engine‚Äù and any other applicable term in law, but the nature of creative destruction is that business is hard to categorize
Not because people we don‚Äôt like are running the companies and people we do like are CURRENTLY in power. Facebook will be around longer than the current majority. Don‚Äôt give them that power. Don‚Äôt get blinded by the now just because conservative outlets are currently losing money
Forcing a regulation that only incumbent firms can reasonably adhere to is unsustainable, and it can‚Äôt predict new market trends and business models, which is the exact problem with government regulations and why conservatives &amp; libertarians don‚Äôt like big gov...
‚ÄúOn this rare occasion, the government can help.‚Äù This is a troubling lack of consistency and faith in the idea that better ideas inevitably come through and overtake market giants when they have the freedom to. https://t.co/RckYODCE4j
@LibertarianBlue @ezralevant Can you be against rampant spending AND implementing regulations that make it even harder for new startups to compete with tech giants? Republicans aren‚Äôt being consistent, but it seems like neither are you.
We can want people to stop being dependent on the state, but we can‚Äôt do that while simultaneously doing nothing to remove internal and external barriers to self-reliance and prosperity.
And what‚Äôs more exemplary of human evil than being categorized into a faceless member of a slightly different pile of biological mush? How many lives have we lost because of this?
Let‚Äôs do that. But let‚Äôs not get caught up in the weeds. Remember a key takeaway. There are no ‚Äúsides‚Äù except the basic argument between the individual and the collective. Is there anything more human than being more than just one of many clumps of biological mush?
We give them info, which works, but can lead to cronyism. So other people give them information, which attempts to neutralize the cronyism, but really just shifts it. What if we built communities that valued the individual and influenced lawmakers based on that basic principle?
RT @botticellicream: üî•thread https://t.co/eEOTSVlAsZ
We place so much faith in our elected officials to regulate our lives and businesses, but they continually disappoint and create externalities that makes it harder for us to live our lives as fulfilled individuals. So what‚Äôs the solution?
Barriers to entry into the workforce, entrepreneurial journeys, and other modes of mutually beneficial self-determination, coupled with dependence on the same state that takes away the above rights creates an almost impenetrable prison cell for the individual.
Knock down barriers to success and free choice. Both sides of the political divide in the U.S. have worked (though often with good intentions) to build up these walls while simultaneously luring people into dependency.
Here‚Äôs a thought: value the ideas and structures that allow the individual to most greatly uplift himself in a way that naturally provides mutual benefit to him and society as a whole (free markets, free societies, self-determination).
Because of partisan blindness (and collectivism) we refuse to acknowledge the obvious similarities between ‚Äúright-wing‚Äù and ‚Äúleft-wing‚Äù collectivism,choose instead to argue over which one is worse instead of working to break the cycle and uplift the individual
Dehumanization of the other is in the same family of concepts as collectivism, and is an inevitable result of emphasis of the collective over the individual. Atrocities are easier to commit and justify in societies that are fragmented in this way.
Collectivism is the most dangerous, genocide-producing world-views ever conceived, and somehow, even after the 20th century, the clearest recent example of the danger of collectivist manifestations, we‚Äôre still trying to convince people of the value of the value of the individual
