This week my family and I took a much-needed vacation. We celebrated my oldest son's return from his first deployment to Iraq. For the first time in 8 years all of our children were in one location. We enjoyed beautiful Georgia mountains and being together. #LisaRing2020 https://t.co/jzMGqZ7Ncm

Last night I was honored to speak to the Hamiltons, and some Abigails, about what we learned in my 2018 campaign and how we are moving forward to 2020. We discussed our successes as a district, my experience as a candidate, and how we plan to win in 2020! #LisaRing2020 https://t.co/zVe732NK3Z
This is how @RepBuddyCarter and @realDonaldTrump want to pay for their wall. On the backs of veterans. It has been their plan all along to gut services to all Americans, including those who serve our country, in order to personally profit. #LRFC2020	https://t.co/5nR58Skbz7
Today I attended a luncheon with some amazing women in Hinesville. Thank you SWAG for working to strengthen and expand our network of successful women in our communities. https://t.co/eH43BT8wpD
It's no surprise that Congressman Carter is fully supporting the current administration. When has he not? There is no cause for a national emergency, and our country has much more pressing issues then fulfilling a two year old campaign promise. #LRFC2020 https://t.co/mu3dNbbENV
Paying for a wall with our nation's funds is socialism.
It is important to remember the victims of this tragedy. Every day we should be working to end this senseless violence. We owe it to all victims of gun violence, their loved ones, and our nation's children. https://t.co/QbhrXsjyva
If the border is considered a state of emergency, what in the world are we going to do about healthcare, gun violence, homelessness, poverty, and our environment? It's time to stand with sensible leaders who will fix the problems in our country, not create more #NoWall #LRFC2020

We didn't take a dollar of corporate money and we knocked on 50,000 doors. We focused on the people who are forgotten, exploited, left behind. We had a strong presence in all 17 counties and focused on rural communities heavily.
Look at what we did. We got 42% of the vote (more than 104,000 votes at last count) in a red district in a red state. We out-raised and out-performed all other 1st CD Democratic candidates since 1993. We did this despite the corruption, collusion, and suppression.

Those who are innocent embrace a full investigation and want the truth revealed. What is being hidden? Why? Why is a questionable character being ushered into a lifetime appointment on the Supreme Court? The answers must be truly frightening.
Helping ex-offenders succeed at becoming productive citizens makes sense socially as well as economically. #GAPol
The cost of incarceration and supervision in Georgia is over $1 billion annually. The recidivism (tendency to reoffend) rate at GA State Prison is over 60% --two to three times that of prisons in other countries where rehabilitation is the focus. #GAPol
As the director of an anti-recidivism program, I saw how rehabilitation benefits ex-offenders and society. Rehabilitation helps people who have served their sentence rejoin society and become contributing members, instead of getting stuck in a cycle.  https://t.co/hRdsgQmP3C

They, and Kavanaugh, should have welcomed a thorough and formal investigation if truth is what they were seeking. Voters -- pay attention. #Ibelieveher
This is a lifetime appointment to the highest court in the land. Political game-playing and posturing at the hands of people like Sen. Graham is reprehensible.
I am encouraged that there will at least be an FBI investigation, while at the same time feeling ashamed of the Senate Judiciary Committee Members who discredited the trauma of sexual assault victims in order to push forward a candidate who serves their political interests.
(Thread) The past few days have been grueling for our nation. The testimonies of Dr. Ford and Judge Kavanaugh force us all to face reality and determine the direction of our country.

I am concerned with this blatant disregard for those who serve. Even more disturbing is how my opponent, who has never served and who represents a district with 4 military bases and 76,000 veterans, supports every harmful move by this president and his administration. #GAPol
To top it off, there is no end to our involvement abroad, as this administration forgets its promise to bring our troops home and continues to expand our involvement overseas. As a military spouse and mother of a deployed soldier,
Add in the gutting of VHA to starve resources for veterans, and the lack of concern for our veterans with unmet needs and  servicemembers who are paid so little they must receive food benefits to feed their families. #GAPol
Let's be clear: This administration does not support our veterans and military families. Jokes about pay aside, the lack of respect for our war heroes, our intelligence leaders, and our Gold Star families is embarrassing to our country. #GAPol

I’d like the citizens of GA-01 to know about a service that could help them a great deal. MedBank is a nonprofit that provides access to vital, life-sustaining medications for patients who otherwise could not obtain them – all at no cost. Check them out: https://t.co/dAPLp7FDdi
We need to reverse these tariffs, and use diplomacy rather than bullying to get back into the good graces of other countries. We need a representative who will stand up to the president, not someone who will go along with him no matter the cost to our district. #WeGotThis #GAPol
Trump's $12 billion bailout – diverting funds from elsewhere to help farmers through a problem he created, undoing decades of progress in agricultural independence — as Sen. Sasse, @SenSasse, put it, “cutting the legs out from under farmers to spend $12 billion on gold crutches.”
GA farmers are being hit hard by the tariffs on cotton, pecans, peanuts, soybeans, sorghum, and corn. Last year, cotton contributed $794 million to GA's economy. $26 million of that was exported to China. #GAPol #GA01		https://t.co/Fzd9af2E7G

When I started this campaign, I knew it wasn't going to be easy. I made a decision to not have a typical approach to campaigning. I decided that everyone in GA01 was important, no matter party affiliation. I wanted to listen to everyone, not just like-minded residents. 	1/5

Brunswick is the #1 port in the nation for new auto imports. Parts and steel also come through Savannah. What happens to those shipping jobs when these cuts in the auto industry begin? And this is before we take farming and all the other GA imports &amp; exports into account. #GAPol
Our president has started a trade war, and our district will feel the effects. A 25% auto tariff alone cuts US auto sales by 2 million and destroys 714,700 jobs. Our ports provide 369,000 shipping related jobs in GA. #GAPol https://t.co/4D4ZjHc1eK

My advice to genuine candidates, stay focused. Your goal is to represent the people. Speak to them directly. Listen to them. Provide solutions. Do not allow yourself to be distracted by anything else. The fate of our nation and the well-being of its people depend on your strength
Our economy may be strong, but wages are not. Over the past year, inflation rose 2.9%, but real wages  went down 1.4%. Your tax break? Erased by 24% higher gas prices. Raising the wage is something I will fight for passionately in Congress. #WeGotThis	https://t.co/3BSwxxYddc

The solar market was one of America’s fastest growing sectors. Now, 80% of its employees are facing a crisis situation.
The U.S. solar industry employs over 250,000 people, many of whom are in Georgia and the Carolinas. While about 20% of these employees work in manufacturing, the lion’s share work in installation and development.		#WeGotThis #GAPol
Our renewable energy companies have been forced to cancel or freeze investments of more than $2.5 billion in large installation projects due to the 30% tariff on imported solar panels – along with thousands of jobs.		#WeGotThis #GAPol

We need your support to reach our general primary fundraising goal. Please contribute whatever amount you can so we can continue to operate the most extensive field operation this district has ever seen. We plan to take back the House and move Georgia forward.
Together, we are doing the work it will take to win. As a candidate, I say NO to corporate money. I am committed to representing the people of this district, not being a spokesperson for large corporations.
#TeamRing is ready to battle for the honor of representing the people of our district. We have two office locations and volunteers throughout the entire district. We've  knocked on over 8,000 doors and spoken to over 13,000 people at events.
For the first time in four years GA-01 voters have a choice on the ballot for Congress. Since June of 2017, my campaign staff, volunteers, and I, have been traveling the district connecting with residents in all 17 counties. #GAPol 		WSAV Interview: https://t.co/t2gmB7hH00

Gracie canvassed, phone banked, participated in a video shoot and a speaking engagement, and she saw the daily workings of a congressional campaign. Gracie and her friends will also be attending the march today in Savannah. Thank you Gracie for being such an incredible person,
For the past three days, my team and I had a special guest. Gracie traveled a few hours to shadow #TeamRing for her senior project. Engaging young people and involving them  in our campaign is very important to me, and to our future. https://t.co/HauCbE4Oqi

. While the U.S has a certain amount of leverage in a trade stand-off with China, the economic relationship we have with them is one of mutual dependence. China is America’s largest trading partner and the fastest-growing market for U.S. exports.(7)
There’s another vital element to this move -what appears to be the start of a trade war with China. China is now, and has been for the last decade, the largest buyer of U.S debt. Already, we have South Korean officials bringing the issue to the WTO, calling the move “excessive”(6
Renewable energy is our future. It’s estimated the job loss from this move will be around 23,000.(5)

this will be an enormous hit to the thriving renewable resources economy. Also, it is not without notice that this is one of many recent moves by the current administration to benefit the fossil fuel industry at the expense of our environment.(2)
In another misguided attempt to take our economic values back to the 1950s, our administration has decided to execute their “America First” policy, slapping a 30% tariff on imported solar panels. This tariff will decrease over the next 4 years, but make no mistake - (thread)

Allowing companies to drill off the coast of Georgia brings the chances of a dangerous oil spill to our district, interferes with national security by our military, and industrializes our beautiful coast. This would hurt the tourist economy on which this district depends, (2)

The risks of fossil fuels (horrible for the environment, oil spills, etc) vastly outweigh the gains. Let’s move to the future: solar and wind energy.
It’s beyond time we shift away from fossil fuels entirely. The future is in clean, renewable energy. When I get into office, moving #HR3671 (the #OffFossilFuels Act) forward is going to be a priority.

We must demand human decency and let our values guide us to become a nation that cares for its citizens. When I am elected to Congress, I will fight to protect our families from neglect and irresponsible economic decisions. As a nation, we must strive for better.
We can’t allow Americans to suffer w/out healthcare, decent jobs, quality education, affordable housing, &amp; public transportation, or allow our infrastructure to crumble &amp; poverty to increase as social programs are dismantled to throw billions of dollars into an unnecessary wall.
It's time for Congress to start making responsible &amp; humane policy decisions.
We currently have 653 miles of secured border that costs us more than $3 million per mile. 2000 miles would cost upward of $66.9 billion. This is an irresponsible allocation of OUR money.
We don't need a wall. From 2009-2014, 870,000 immigrants arrived in the U.S. from Mexico. During that same period of time, one million people left the U.S. and returned to Mexico. More are leaving than staying.

Philly, John and I will miss you and the light you shared with so many people who had the honor of knowing you. The void you leave can not be filled, but we can honor your memory by making the changes you fought for with all your strength and passion.
It was Philly who was the deciding factor in my decision to run for Congress. When he told me I was the representation this district needed, and that he would be by my side all the way, I knew what I had to do. https://t.co/9ubvq5eDrA
Philly was the one who asked John and I to form our county committee and who asked for our help in organizing and promoting M.O.R.E. throughout the district. Because of him, we have three new committees and renewed interest throughout the district. https://t.co/xyJU9X57t1
This he did despite his own health issues, which he would never admit, and would never let stop him from the work needing to be done.		Philly could be counted on, if he wasn't already organizing the group or the event personally, to be there- even when no one else was.
He helped everyone in need he encountered, and supported everyone's efforts to organize for change. This he did while caring for his brother, who suffered from Agent Orange exposure in Vietnam, and while always being present for his children and grandchildren.
Philly was not only a leader who fought  passionately for all people and touched the lives of everyone he met with his fighting spirit of activism, he was also the most compassionate and generous person I've ever known. https://t.co/rusrHnA7K6
My heart is broken. This morning, Philly Meyers, our close friend and our brother in the political revolution, passed away. From the moment we met at a union Labor Day picnic in 2013, we were on a mission to destroy corruption in politics, and lead the people to power. https://t.co/isq4O3NfTY

Also, a healthy, clean environment, and strong international diplomacy (or lack thereof), impacts everyone - regardless of socio-economic status.
When we help the disadvantaged &amp; strengthen the middle class, our economy thrives bc people have $ to put back into the economy. The wealthy cannot sustain their wealth if there are no consumers, &amp; there can be no economic growth when wages stagnate &amp; opportunity is non-existent.
You might say that someone always loses when another benefits, so it is not possible to leave no one behind. This is not true. By investing in people and communities, everyone benefits.
The other component in this philosophy is family. We succeed together or fail together, and we must be willing to use our strength when our brothers and sisters are vulnerable, to carry them to safety. We move forward together.
No One Gets Left Behind is a reference to the military tenet of leaving no service member behind in battle. Because I am a military spouse &amp; military mom running in a district with 4 military bases &amp; over 75,000 vets, it is only fitting that our attitude is one of solidarity.
We must acknowledge that creating equal opportunity means some people need more resources than others to level the playing field.
It means we will fight for the betterment of the lives of every person in #GA01, and everywhere, regardless of location, income, race, age, gender, sexual preference, or religious affiliation. It also means we must foster a spirit of equity.

This year, let us honor those who paved the way by electing a wave of strong, progressive women to Congress.
From 1929 to 1939 she was a lobbyist and speaker for the National Council for the Prevention of War and later became an active member of the Women's International League for Peace and Freedom (WILPF), serving in several key positions.
In 1924 she bought a small farm in Georgia that had no electricity or plumbing and founded the pacifist organization, The Georgia Peace Society.
After her term ended in 1919, Jeannette Rankin focused much of her energy on pacifism &amp; social welfare. She served as a delegate to the Women's International Conference for Peace along with such other noted figures as Jane Addams, Emily Greene Balch, Alice Hamilton &amp; Lillian Wald
During World War 1, Ms. Rankin fought for the rights of women working in the war effort. She also created women's rights legislation and helped pass the Nineteenth Amendment to the U.S. Congress, granting women the right to vote.
In a narrow win, the resolution passed the House but died in the Senate.
“How shall we answer the challenge, gentlemen?” Rankin asked. “How shall we explain to them the meaning of democracy if the same Congress that voted to make the world safe for democracy refuses to give this small measure of democracy to the women of our country?”
In 1917 Rankin proposed the formation of a Committee on Woman Suffrage, of which she was appointed leader. In 1918, she addressed the House Floor after the committee issued a report for a constitutional amendment on the women's right to vote:
Although it was a very close race, Rankin won her 1916 campaign to become the first woman to serve in Congress. This accomplishment is even more notable when one considers this was a time when many women still did not have the right to vote.
While living in WA, she became active in the drive to amend the state's constitution to give women the right to vote. The measure passed in 1911, &amp; Rankin returned home to MT to win the right to vote for the women of her home state. MT granted women the right to vote in 1914.
On this first day of 2018, I think it’s the perfect time to honor those who have paved the way:		Jeannette Rankin found her calling in the women's suffrage movement. (Thread)

I hope everyone who reads this is having a safe New Years. The fight to bring progressive voices to Washington continues tomorrow.
We must provide a defined and accessible path to citizenship for people wishing to make the US their permanent home, and stop pouring money into a system that destroys families and allows us to turn our backs on people who believe in the American Dream.
We must end the criminalization of immigration by closing inhumane and costly deportation centers and investing in a system that treats people as human beings.
Our economy, our growth, and our success depend on a progressive immigration policy that supports inclusivity and recognizes the importance of all people.
As long as we buy into the belief that only wealthy, corporate-backed candidates will win elections, nothing will change. With the closing of this quarter at midnight of 12/31, Progressives running for office to represent you, will need your help. https://t.co/3taT45SPYI

- Our economy is not an "Us vs. Them" issue. We all win, or we all lose, together. Many wealthier Americans and corporations understand this, which is why they are speaking up about the destructive new tax structure.
- Investing in America is the only way to prosper as a nation. When we invest in education, career training, infrastructure, and our people as a whole, our economy thrives and all of us, including the very wealthy, prosper.
-Corporations are not the job creators. Demand creates jobs. Giving the extremely wealthy more profits, simply gives them more money. It does nothing but hurt our economy. Trickle-down economics is a lie.
truth and empower people to raise their voices in unison. Here are some basic truths:		- Since the 1980's, the rich get richer and the poor get poorer, the middle class is shrinking significantly.

Thank you to everyone who organized, donated, and volunteered. We, as a society, must work together to solve the problems that lead to human beings living in tents and fighting for survival.
This morning we had the honor of volunteering with Never Counted Out, providing boots, blankets, warm clothing, toiletries, food, and hot drinks, in front of the Inner City Shelter. We made many new friends today, including Maggie and Mark Buckner, the organizers of NCO. https://t.co/Au7WefjNVp

Your neighbor in Jesup believes we must tackle racial injustice. And your neighbor in Brunswick knows we must combat climate change now. I have met so many amazing people, committed to helping others, and dedicated to real change. We agree much more than we disagree.
Your neighbor in Blackshear wants quality public education for all our children. Your neighbor in Hinesville believes we must pay workers a living wage. Your neighbor in Savannah is fighting for #MedicareForAll.
We are united in decency. We are united in love. We are united. Please take this message to heart, and let it carry you into 2018.
I have spoken face-to-face with thousands of people in my district, in Georgia, and throughout the U.S. I've spoken to people of all faiths, skin colors, political affiliations, geographical locations, levels of income, and education levels. We are not divided.
If you stay connected to the world via social media or news outlets, you will begin to believe our country is so divided it could never be repaired. You will see people fighting over party lines, skin color, gender, anything that makes one different. That is not reality.
We feel divided- from our country, our community, our neighbors, even sometimes, our own families. 		In the midst of this holiday season, with a new year fast approaching, I wish to give you a gift. The gift of encouragement.
It is easy to get discouraged. Some of us carry the weight of the world on our shoulders, and it sure does get heavy. We see hatred, inequality, injustice, and tragedy all around us. We feel small. Insignificant. Powerless. (Thread)

- If you have it, your children will be able to inherit $22 million from you, tax-free.
- If you are a large corporation, your tax cut is all at once and immediate. From 35% to 21% in January 2018.		- If you are a middle-income individual, your modest tax cut will phase out in the next 10 years and your tax rate will go up. Corporate tax cuts are permanent.

Employers will legally be able to pocket service workers’ tips, as long as the worker is earning minimum wage. This means employees will bring home even less pay. We can't allow such unfair employment practices.
$15 billion each year is stolen from workers due to minimum wage violations. Now, Trump's Department of Labor wants to rescind protections for tipped workers which prohibits employers from taking "pooled tips.”

@OpenSecretsDC Roughly half of all members of Congress are multimillionaires, which might explain why most legislation benefits the wealthy and not the working class.
According to @OpenSecretsDC, my Republican opponent had an estimated net worth of over $35 million in 2016. Maybe that’s why he’s determined to pass this #GOPTaxScam that hurts the majority of his voters and repeal healthcare legislation that helped millions in this country.

4/ This is unacceptable. We cannot allow Congress to continually gut our public services &amp; institutions to hand them over to profiteers. Speak up. Tell your rep you oppose this bill because it is harmful to our nation, and tell them you are watching how they vote.
3/ This bill eliminates loan forgiveness for public service, limits oversight powers of the US Department of Education to protect students from for-profit educators, and eliminates some large grants and loans.
2/ The PROSPER Act was introduced into the House last week as a reauthorization of the Higher Education Act of 1965. Unfortunately, this legislation is another GOP attempt to hand-off higher education to private, for-profit entities.
1/ Our students deserve access to quality education. They shouldn't have to struggle for decades to pay off loans to gain that education. If we want our nation to prosper and lead in a global economy, we should be providing our children with the tools to do so.
