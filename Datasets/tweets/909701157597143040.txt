@KassyDillon @nikkihaley I love fruit on pizza! Pineapple bar b Wye chicken is the best in my neck of the woods. Lol!
@antischool_ftw Always good to know what the enemy is planning. Keep your friends closer and your enemies closer than friends. Right? Potus is a very intelligent man. He hadn't let us down yet!
@jasoninthehouse In charge? Ill never vote for another demo ever again! Putting their agenda before our military, etc. Is the lowest of the low. I'm sick of illegal immigrants and funding them. Its time we take care of our own! #DumpDACA #ReleaseTheMemo
@RepMarkMeadows ReleasetheMemo
@BreakingNLive @Jim_Jordan #ReleaseTheMemo
@FAIRImmigration @sacbee_news Fine them!
@PressSec American needs first Schumer! No DACA and no illegal immigrants! I'm tired of paying for illegal immigrants needs before ours. Kick em all out @Potus
@realDonaldTrump Lock up the dems! Now's the time to kick out all illegal immigrants and ship them back to their countries. Rain on DACA. Take care of our own Mr. President! God bless you, our military, and border agents. Make for sure all dems don't receive their paycheck! #release the memo
@kyungkarenmend1 @realDonaldTrump Your point?
@realDonaldTrump I thank the Lord for you everyday. I'm so happy and proud of your hard work and determination to MAGA.
@realDonaldTrump I'm ready to get rid of all democrats in DC. I've never in my life seen such cry babies, backstabbing, and just plain mean people in all my life. To think that immigrants are more important than our military? For sure it will be a cold day in hell before I vote for a liberal!
@FoxNews @RepWilson @POTUS Well bless her heart. If I was Potus I sure wouldn't want that idiot attending the State of the Union address because SHE'S an embarrassment! I'm shaking my head at the stupidity this woman has. Really? She needs to stay in Florida with that mouth and those horrible hats of hers!
@FoxNews I guess she doesn't have a best friend. What a bunch of crap! I swear our world has no common sense anymore.

@realDonaldTrump @FoxNews Your so right Mr. President! CNN is nothing but lies. The embarrassment to our country...Obama, is out of office, thank God! By the replies to your tweet rest assured you must be doing a great job because the leftist are out popping their mouths! Thanks, Mr. President! Great job!
@FoxNews It's time for you to go lady!
@conserv_tribune Please retire!
@JudicialWatch @JohnCornyn What's taking so long?
@riherdcreates He is in love.
@TexasMonthly Why so we can foot the bill?  Tired of government waste!
@riherdcreates Really....trying to figure out what I'm doing. I feel so dumb... Lol!
RT @riherdcreates: Time to get some Tweets out there. You can't waste all your time on Facebook. Waste some on Twitter. @JanaPorter20
