And lastly, a surprisingly modest-sounding bill:  Award prizes for groundbreaking projects that capture carbon from the air (and speed permitting) for carbon capture projects. But the USE IT Act from @SenJohnBarrasso is a top 2019 priority for a coalition of CCS backers.
Another incremental climate idea for 2019 would use, yes, that still elusive infrastructure package to attach incentives for miles of new pipelines needed to transport captured carbon for storage and other climate-friendly uses.
Next year: Look for a push for more R&amp;D for carbon capture.
This year: Congress agreed to ramp up `45Q‚Äô tax credits over 10 years to $35 per ton for using carbon for enhanced oil and gas recovery and $50 per ton for C02 stored in geological formations.
If November‚Äôs election ends with a divided Congress, expect to see little progress on bills tackling climate change but instead incremental steps that help boost renewable energy or reduce emissions. My take: https://t.co/eNsZ2Srxhv

Senate passage of #omnibus bill avoids govt shutdown. Big picture for my money is @EPA funding held essentially constant at $8 billion or so once again for FY18, despite Trump‚Äôs deep proposed cuts.

Among the winners in EPA-Interior portion of #omnibus bill: greenhouse gas reporting efforts @EPA which Trump sought to cut $30.8 million from FY17 enacted levels. Instead ghg reporting would be held steady at $116 million for FY18--same as last year.

@LDCChairUNFCCC says US 'only one country' + nations must not let #ParisAgreement exit 'distract us from the important work we need to do'
Trump's reference to renegotiating the #ParisAgreement aside, the one quote that matters is this one: `It is time to exit the Paris accord'
Trump: clean energy can only meet `some of our domestic demands' if econ growth stays at 1% a yr but `all forms of energy' needed for 3-4%
The #ParisAgreement was `a massive redistribution of United States wealth to other countries' Trump says.
The #ParisAgreement was applauded by rest of world `for simple reason' that it put the United States at significant disadvantage, Trump says
Trump on #ParisAgreement `China will be allowed to build 100s of coal plants. We can't build the plants. They can, under this agreement'
