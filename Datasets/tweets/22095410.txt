At Bernie Sanders’ second campaign kickoff rally, Rep. @RoKhanna goes directly at one of the chief criticisms of Sanders in 2016: “Bernie Sanders doesn’t just talk ... he delivers.” Look, he says, at his Yemen work &amp; Amazon raising its wage to $15/hour after his “Stop BEZOS Act.” https://t.co/JBmThYI29Z

Per the new NBC/WSJ poll, “56 percent of Democratic primary voters say they want a candidate whose issue positions conform to their views, while 40 percent say they prefer someone who gives the party the best chance to defeat Trump in 2020.” https://t.co/FapjXtl109

Also worth noting: Ed Rendell argued that this audio being released was the “most devastating" moment of Wallace’s candidacy. "I thought it was an even race until that,” he said. (Wallace’s campaign called the clip a “smear.”) https://t.co/3oBQSfwb5a
Another major part of the race was an onslaught of misleading ads tying Wallace to Mumia Abu-Jamal, who was convicted of murdering a Philadelphia police officer in 1981. Critics likened the spots to the infamous Willie Horton ad. https://t.co/1JicO6VPx8

In many ways, Bernie Sanders’ campaign kickoff rally was a peek at the personal origins of the class rage that has powered his political career. https://t.co/fVdsOltJmZ
Inbox: Bernie Sanders is headed to Iowa next week, with rallies in Council Bluffs, Iowa City and Des Moines. “The Iowa City event will be co-sponsored by University of Iowa Democrats and the local chapter of Young Democratic Socialists of America.”
Sanders is now spending a lot of time contrasting his background with Trump’s, saying, “I did not come from a family that taught me to build a corporate empire through housing discrimination. I protested housing discrimination.”
Now Bernie Sanders gets personal, talking about how his family growing up lived paycheck to paycheck and how he is the son of an immigrant. “I know where I came from!” he roars. “And that is something I will never forget.”
After a group of diverse speakers talked about Sanders’ biography, he starts his speech in a familiar way, railing against inequality, “the billionaire class,” and promising a gov’t “based on justice — economic justice, social justice, racial justice and environmental justice.”
Bernie Sanders kicks off his speech by thanking the speakers who preceded him. “We’re not going to concede one state to Trump,” he says. https://t.co/S8DSIGmX83
“To this day, I still believe that he would have beaten Donald Trump,” says @ShaunKing of the 2016 election. https://t.co/7gzlaesXYs

Or it will try to, at least. As the press release for the events notes, Sanders “grew up in a small, rent controlled apartment in Flatbush. He is a public school graduate of James Madison High School and attended Brooklyn College before graduating from the University of Chicago.”

Per a Sanders aide, about 135 people — at capacity — are at a meeting of South Carolina’s Our Revolution chapter where @BernieSanders is scheduled to speak. It is closed to the press. https://t.co/rVIc0zzocJ
He says “there are some really good people who have announced” they are running for president and “they’re really good friends of mine.” He says “the assessment I have got to make is, is there a willingness in this country at the grassroots level” to take on powerful interests.
Sanders says he’s excited that in 2018 “we saw, in a unique way, millions of young people getting involved” and 40 new Democrats get elected, “many of them are people of color, they are young, they are women — that’s a good thing.”
Oh damn. Moderator Angela Douglas asks Sanders if he’s running for president. “Run Bernie run!” an audience member shouts.
Now the roundtable is talking about climate change. “Tragically, we have a president that believes climate change is a hoax,” Sanders says to applause. “There’s a huge opportunity, it seems to me, to rebuild America” while addressing the issue.
RT @PoliticoCharlie: Both made their first early primary state appearances of 2019 today – and the location wasn’t by chance. Good reportin…
Now the discussion is centered on criminal justice. Sanders laments cash bail — “their crime is that they’re poor—they cannot afford bail” — and the War on Drugs. “Let’s invest in our kids, rather than jails and incarceration.”
Jaime Harrison, former chair of the South Carolina Dem Party, says he left Georgetown with a whopping $160K in debt. “You know who I hated the most? Sallie Mae,” he says, adding, “When you’re young, black and poor, it’s not just about you”—you’re responsible to extended family.
The first question is about the student debt crisis. Sanders stands up to answer it, urges people to “think big, not small” on this issue. He says when he first talked about free college, “people thought it was a very radical and crazy idea.” But that’s changing, he says.
Good afternoon from the roundtable at the Zion Baptist Church with @BernieSanders, moderated by the South Carolina NAACP. https://t.co/bQ7AE0HupA
.@BernieSanders talks about the racial wealth gap, criminal justice reform, ending cash bail, ending the War on Drugs, black infant mortality rates, poverty among black children, Medicare for All, gentrification pushing out black homeowners and business owners, and more.
