I have no “allegiance” to Israel. But as a proud American, I support Israel because Israel is good. The charge of “dual-citizenship” or “allegiance” to a foreign country is thinly veiled anti-Semitism. @IlhanMN is an embarrassment to the Congress.
As an American, I love and support Israel because it, along with the US, is one of the few countries on earth where Jews can live in freedom &amp;peace. Like the US, it’s a democracy. A pro-western country in a sea of dictatorships. Israel is on our side and we should be on Israel’s.
This is deeply insulting. I’m a first generation American. My mother fled the Nazis in 1939 and came to this great country. Almost all her family was slaughtered in the Holocaust. Her Aunt Renee survived and made it to Palestine after WW II. In 1948 Palestine became Israel. https://t.co/e0xwjqlyBb

Watching CNN this morning, I saw Judiciary Committee Rep. David Cicilline (D-RI) say Trump was on a "crime spree" prior to his election as POTUS and Rep. Cummings (D-MD) said evidence emerged ystrdy that Trump committed a crime as POTUS. Hard to see that Ds won't try to impeach.

Finally, someone asked Cohen if he ever went to Prague.  He said no.  Unless that's a lie, mark another strike against the dossier, which the Obama Administration amazingly took seriously.
Notice that Ds are not asking Cohen direct questions re the Steele dossier. No Qs about Prague; golden showers; or other outlandish allegations. I suspect it's because the Ds, after making a huge deal re the dossier, doubt it is true so they don't want Cohen to discuss it.
Sound frivilous, but serious: Ask Cohen if he is aware of any other hush money payments Trump made to women, other than to Stormy Daniels and Karen McDougal. If there is a pattern of personal payments, predating the campaign, it is a relevant fact in the FEC matter.
Watching Cohen dance around the Q about what he pled guilty to makes me wonder if Cohen pled guility to crimes he believes he did not commit. He acts like he didn't want to fight SDNY, so he just pled guilty. Someone should ask him if he pled guilty to things he didn't do.
I remember this well.  The Chinese told American reporters not to ask Qs to Jiang. The WH was fine with you asking Qs, and expected you to do so. I recall after an American reporter did pose a Q to Jiang, Jiang replied in broken English “no more questions!”  Everyone chuckled. https://t.co/TqRR29NOSO

A joint announcement with Mueller explaining the facts and Barr explaining what - if anything - happens next would be the best way to handle this. The more disclosure the better.  Mueller still has a public role to play. So too does the AG.
The nation needs a fair, credible, public and independent understanding of whether collusion took place - or not.  It is the Justice Department’s job to deliver it.
The new AG, William Barr, doesn’t have the baggage of being part of the investigation. It will be a test of his independence &amp; judgment. But that’s the job. I hope he discloses as much as possible, recognizing parts of this are a counter-intell probe that typically remain secret.
It is not the FBI’s job and not the independent cousel’s job to shield, protect or otherwise do the job of the Attorney General. Obama’s AG should have decided whether or not to indict Hillary and then handled the consequences.
As someone who has defended Bob Mueller’s integrity from the start, I’ve thought about this a lot. Just as it was emphatically not James Comey’s business to hold a solo news conference to announce why he did not seek to indict Hillary, Mueller should learn from that mistake.

Presidents have the power to move people, to convince them that they should follow his lead. Trump doesn’t do that. He simply asserts his position. He doesn’t explain it and therefore create more supporters. It’s one reason why his support is limited to just his base.

When Trump ran, it would have surprised no one that he had an affair with a pornstar and playboy bunny. And paying hush money is unseemly, but it’s not criminal. If Mueller goes after Trump for this, it’s overly aggressive. Voters, not prosecutors, should settle these matters.
If Mueller has evidence Trump/his campaign worked w Russia to hack the DNC/Podesta’s email, that changes everything.  If he has evidence Trump paid hush money during the campaign, that changes nothing. The former is serious. The latter is not.

You don’t defend the Constitution by infringing upon it. Our system’s political checks and balances work. Trump won’t fire Mueller because he knows doing so will hurt himself.  But if he were dumb enough to do so, he has the right.
I 100% oppose any legislation to “protect” Mueller.  Such a measure is an unconstitutional infringement on the powers of the presidency.
But just because it’s dumb doesn’t mean that Constitutionally he doesn’t have the right to do it. Everyone in the executive branch works for the President.  He has the right to fire. Trump’s predecessors had that right. His successors will have that right. He has that right.
Many Rs who cut Trump some slack, even if they don’t always like him, will turn against him.  Trump’s approval rating will plunge and he will be in credible danger of impeachment and possibly conviction.		Nothing Trump could do would be dumber than firing Mueller.

This story quotes CNN and the WH. Then it quotes four people who agree with CNN.    CNN sues White House to regain access for reporter Jim Acosta https://t.co/ZRQP5zEFP0
Jim Jordan and the Freedom Caucus never did this to John Boehner or Paul Ryan.  But AOC did.  The next two years are going to be interesting... https://t.co/Q2s2fgDgA0
@DelWilber It’s a government building.  The government decides.  Typically, cooler heads (on both sides) prevail and the disputes don’t get this far.  But too much of the press can’t stand Trump and he can’t stand them, so le voila.
Update: I have been told by a couple WH reporters that Acosta applied for a day pass and was turned down. I hope CNN tells him to stop grandstanding and simply ask hard Qs. The WH should let him in on a day pass, and if he stops editorializing, he should get his hard pass back. https://t.co/JRecp4XSJH
@WalshFreedom @Acosta Actually, the government does has a say about who is allowed into gvt buildings. Should the Obama WH have given a hard pass to Sean Hannity if he wanted one? How about if Chris Matthews wants one for the Trump WH? The briefing room is for working reporters, not columnists/hosts.
If I were in charge of CNN, I'd tell Acosta to stop taking stands and to simply ask questions.  If i were in charge at the WH, I'd let some time pass and let Acosta back in, so long as he agrees to stop his editorial act.
Tension in the briefing room is natural and inevitable, but Acosta has pushed the envelope beyond what any reporter I've ever known has done. I think CNN's suit is a bad move that will backfire. Acosta Hill is the wrong one to die on.
I personally wouldn't have pulled his hard pass. I'd have made light of it, wishing him good luck getting his op-eds published. Or hoping he finally gets to host a nighttime cable TV show. The hostility between the press and the Trump WH is unhealthy and Acosta is the example.
On Acosta, I can't defend his behavior. He uses his position in the briefing room to espouse pesonal points of view. "It's not an invasion" he said re the caravan. His job is to ask challenging Qs, not argue for his POV. He goes too far and hurts the rest of the press corps.
Acosta has access to the White House, the same every other opinion writer or op-ed writer has. He remains a member of the press corps and he can apply for a daily WH press pass. The only thing he lost is a hard pass, which clears him daily w/o need for a day pass. https://t.co/BOMvAxJ1HS

Assuming the R gain in the Senate remains +3, it would be the biggest gain for the party in power during a first mid-term since Ds gained 3 Senate seats under JFK in 1962.  LBJ lost 4; Nixon +2; Ford -5; Carter -3; Reagan +1; Bush (41) -1; Clinton -8; Bush (43) +2; Obama -6.
Of the 10 battleground Senate races, Rs did better than the final RCP polling average in six of them (FL, IN, MO, ND, WV, TN), Ds did better in 2 (NV, TX), one race is pending (AZ), and one was almost exactly correct (MT). IN was off the most, by 7 points.

@jpodhoretz Correct.  That’s why I said it surged.  Some were saying on tv it was up “to near presidential levels”. It wasn’t.  That’s why I gave the raw numbers.
@jpodhoretz What point are you making?  You object to turn out numbers?
9)The education gap has grown wider.  In 2006 (last time Ds won the House) college grads were +7 for the Ds. Yesterday they were +30 for the Ds. In 2006, non-college grads were +8 for the Ds. Yesterday, they were evenly split.
8) The youth vote was not up much. 18-29 yr. olds were 13% of the electorate yesterday. In last 3 mid-terms they were 12, 12, and 13%.
7) Turnout by voters 65+ surged yesterday, probably thanks to Trump nationalizing the election. Seniors yesterday were 26% of the electorate. In last 3 mid-terms, they were 19, 21, and 22%.
6) The GOP’s problem with women has grown. In ‘06, Rs lost women by 12. Ystrdy, GOP lost women by 19.
5) The share of white voters is declining, but Ds are increasingly losing whites. White voters were 79% of all voters in 2006; 77% in 2010; 75% in 2014 and 72% yesterday. In ‘06, last time Ds took House, they lost white voters by 4 points. Ystrdy, Ds lost white voters by 10.
4) Turnout surged, but not to Presidential levels. In last 3 POTUS elections, roughly 130 million voted. In last 3 mid-terms, roughly 85 million voted. Looks like some 100 million voted yesterday.
3) D control of House presents peril and promise for Trump. The peril is subpoenas and investigations. The promise is Trump has a liberal foil to run against.
My observations:		1) GOP losses in the House are in line w the historical average. R gains in the Senate were unusual. 		2) If Rs had held the House, the margin would have been so small, nothing of substance would have passed anyway. Senate continues to give R judges.

4) 2008 didn't predict what would happen in 2010, which didn't predict what would happen in 2012 which didn't predict what would happen in 2014, which certainly didn't predict what would happen in 2016. 2018 won't predict what will happen in 2020.
My predictions:		1) GOP gains net 3 in the Sen.	2) GOP loses between 20-30 in the House	3) No matter what, the results will be exaggerated, over-dramatized and over-hyped for their future significance, esp vis-a-vis impact on Trump's re-elect.

@jayrosen_nyu Or perhaps, in addition to covering FOX, the media covered what Julia Ioffe said &amp;scrutinized CNN's reaction, instead of glancing over it. Or they could cover a CNN contributor's relationship w Louis Farrakhan. Instead, they target 1 outlet in depth &amp;mostly give a pass to others.
@mlcalderone I think those comments are worth criticizing, as I have regularly done. But I think there are many comments made on CNN, MSNBC &amp; in other outlets that deserve scrutiny. Morning Media's bent, however, is mostly to criticize Trump and FOX.  I'm looking for fair coverage all around.
I unsubscribed this morning from Politico’s “Morning Media” newsletter. I had hoped it would be an informative look at how the media covers the news. Instead, it’s mostly about what Trump and FOX News do wrong every day. It’s too slanted, and MSM typical. Not worth the read.
@stevenportnoy Fair enough.  But then the issue is "how far will the President go", not will he "suspend the constitution".  The former is a fair question. The latter is extreme and it promotes fear.

It means not only does an accuser not need proof, but if the accused every failed to remember something, they're guilty.
Brett already said under oath he sometimes drank too much.  		But now, for the MSM, their logic is because Brett drank “heavily” in college, he must have committed sexual assault in high school.

If these questions are a guide, the Ds also should have hired someone to ask questions.  Their line of Qs so far is embarrassing and absurd. The writings of a 17-year-old in a high school year book are somehow relevant to these 60-and 70-year old Senators. This is so misguided.
Whitehouse is embarrassing himself.  High school yearbooks?   You must be kidding me.
If Feinstein thought it was important enough to advise Ford on what lawyer to hire, and then met with Kavanaugh without raising the issues that required a lawyer, shame on Feinstein.  That is called a set up.
So now what’s in high school yearbooks is a valid measure of a grown man.  Leahy’s question is absurd.
I expected Ms. Mitchell to establish facts, including how to explain why none of the people Prof. Ford said were at the party remember being at the party.  Republicans on the committee didn’t ask any questions. They also haven’t raised any doubts about Prof. Ford’s account.
As this comes to a close, Rachel Mitchell is going to need a closing statement that pulls a rabbit out of her hat. I don’t understand the point of her questions.

You can immediately see why having Rachel Mitchell ask questions makes sense.  Instead of Senators who give speeches to prove their own points, Mitchell asks questions aimed at establishing facts.

For all the focus on Rachel Mitchell, the GOP’s designated questioner, it’s also worth focusing on the D questioners. 		If they go too far, if they figuratively stick their fingers in Brett’s chest and accuse him of a crime, I predict there will be a surge in support for Brett.
This is one of the coolest things I’ve ever seen on a ball field.  Hats off to @bracamonte85.  What a kind and classy thing to do. https://t.co/Z0EcXm2Vpw
I mean Garland, not Gorsuch, in question 3.  Thanks to those who pointed that out.
Qs I hope the media ask D Members of Congress:		1) If Kav is confirmed, will you accept as legitimate all Supreme Court rulings?		2)  Do you extend to Brett the presumption of innocence?		3)  If Ds take the Sen, will you block any Trump nominee for the SC as Rs did to Gorsuch?
The last 3 polls of likely voters (not adults or registered) show Trump's job approval is 47%. Disapproval is 51%. Ystrdy, Gallup said GOP favorables are at a 7-year high. Given the noise in DC, this seems odd. But the strong economy may mean 11/6 won't be as bad as people think.
I lived in DC for 21 years. There were many contested, emotional battles. 		But this is awful. Washington has become a sick town.

9) All of this is why I hope Professor Ford announces today she will testify. It’s the only fair way for the few Senators who haven’t made up their mind to judge this. 		10) Further delay serves no purpose. It’s either time for Ford to speak, or time to vote. We should know 2day.
8)  Accusers can be accurate. It is painful and difficult to tell a room of strangers what happened. But justice cannot be achieved any other way.
7)  Accusers can be inaccurate. Duke Lacrosse, UVA/Rolling Stones come to mind. Colin Kaepernick (having nothing to do with kneeling) in 2014 was accused of sexual assault. The press ran with it. His accuser made it up.
4)  There should be no more delays. If Professor Ford doesn’t act by today’s deadline, the vote should take place Monday. 		5)  The accused are innocent until proven guilty. 		6)  Victims need not remember every detail to be credible.
What I believe:		1)  People who are sexually assaulted may never tell anyone. It’s a valid coping mechanism. 		2)  People who make accusations deserve to be heard. 		3)  Sen. Grassley has been more than fair giving Professor Ford her opportunity to be heard.
If the 10:00pm is arbitrary, all deadlines are arbitrary. The Ds don’t want this to be brought to a conclusion. After Professor Ford’s lawyers said she was prepared to testify, it seems all they want is to delay. They’re trying desperately to push this until after the election. https://t.co/VnCemQBaNd

Final point: Trump has no reason to take action against Rosenstein. But he sure was right to fire Andy McCabe.
The story also claims Rosenstein "followed up by suggesting that other F.B.I. officials who were interviewing to be the bureau’s director could also secretly record Mr. Trump." 		I doubt anyone would ever seriously contemplate that. It's outlandish.
Rosenstein denied the story, saying: "Based on my personal dealings with the President, there is no basis to invoke the 25th Amendment."
This story reads like Andy McCabe trying to burn down the house he once lived in. Looks to me like McCabe is trying to get revenge on those he used to work with, after they challenged his honesty and fired him. https://t.co/VhJldT7KNm
The reason Professor Ford's lawyers don't want an outside lawyer to ask questions is because they don't want a woman to be the questioner. They prefer the optics of all male questioners. It shows how politically calculating her lawyers are.

To put a finer point on this, the story had 2 hooks: 1) government waste and 2) a Trump scandal. Gov waste is always a legit story. The problem however was point 2. No one saw the anti-Trump bias because the bias is widespread. Editors who think differently would have caught it.
The deeper problem here is the lack of ideological diversity at the NYT. It took conservatives on Twitter zero seconds to catch what was wrong. Why didn’t any editors spot the problem before the story ran? Newsrooms would benefit if they thought more like America. https://t.co/xQZeFp7Ghr

In his 2002 book “Bush at War”, some of his Bush quotes are because I gave them to Woodward. The WH cooperated w Woodward so my job was to fill him in.

@GeorgeSchroeder Manual.  With my notes in front of me describing what took place and what Bush said.
I returned to my office and gathered with my staff.  We talked about what happened and how they were doing.  I have no idea what time I left to drive home.		That's what I did on September 11, 2001.  		May God Bless the United States of America.
@marybschneider I did.  One lesson I somehow mastered at the WH was that sleep and rest are precious. When my head hit the pillow, I was out.  Then I'd be up early and I'd do it again.
After the speech was over, I walked with POTUS to the PEOC (Presidential Emergency Operations Center) where he would attend a meeting of the National Security Council. When we got there, some of the USSS had long guns. That was an amazing site to see in the safety of the WH.
8:30 Bush addressed the nation from the Oval: "A great people have been moved to defend a great nation. Terrorist attacks can shake the foundations of our biggest buildings, but they cannot touch the foundation of America."   https://t.co/3mmCGEjE7o  (Four minutes)
@BradAustinGlo No idea.  Aboard AFOne, the crew kept us well fed, but I don't recall any of it.
Bush's Oval Office address was scheduled for 8:30pm. POTUS went back to the residence to see Mrs. Bush and to get ready for the speech. I went back to my office, where I was greeted by a small contingent of WH reporters. Many WH reporters were stuck in FL, unable to get home. https://t.co/15tDslN0F3
6:58  We got back to the WH and the President gathered with aides in his private dining room off the Oval Office to talk about the day and to discuss that night's speech. https://t.co/oDBLiBHcd3
“The mightiest building in the world is on fire” he said aloud to no one in particular. “That’s the 21st century was you just witnessed.”
We boarded Marine One for the flight to the WH. Our route took us over the Capitol, down the Mall and we banked right at the Washington Monument.  As we banked, POTUS could see the burning Pentsgon out his window.
6:45: Air Force One landed back at Andrews Air Force Base outside Washington, D.C.
We flew back to Washington with an F-16 figher escort.  That's a rare event for Air Force One, especially when flying over the United States. https://t.co/oDyjSCecD3
"Everyone must understand this will not stand." He expressed his gratitude to world leaders who expressed support for the US and said "the world is uniting against terrorism."  		"No one is going to diminish the spirit of this country" he said.
5:05: Bush called Karen Hughes, Councelor to the President for communciations, to tell her what he wanted to say in his address to the nation that night.		He told her, "We will find these people and they will suffer the consequences of taking on this nation."
4:55  The President called his father and he also called Ted Olsen, the Solicitor General who lost his wife that day.  I slipped out of his cabin so he could have privacy for both calls.
@fitbyfaithPapaJ A huge upgrade followed. They say the comms failure can never happen again. They also got satellite TV on AFOne so we could watch live TV from anywhere in the world.  Which meant we watched too many Texas Rangers games.
4:30: President Bush calls Mrs. Bush, saying, "I'm coming home. See you at the WH. Love you...go on home."		He added, "If I'm in the WH and there's a plane coming my way, all I can say is I hope I read my Bible that day."
The "Angel is next" news appeared almost immediately on NBC's scrawl.  The rest of the WH press corps were furious with me for giving an "exclusvie" to NBC about something so important. Some days there's just no winning with the press.
On 9/12, I called Williams to tell him how wrong he was, I mentioned the "Angel is next" call. He asked if he could report it and I said yes. 		As a sidenote, TV news prior to 9/12 did not include the scawl at the bottom with words about running news events. That began on 9/12.
Thru much of the day, Brian Williams of NBC and Peter Jennings of ABC were very critical of Bush for not coming back to DC sooner. I don't think either one realized the security implications of landing POTUS at known locations like Andrews or the WH until we knew it was safe.
4:26:  POTUS turns to his military aide and says he's going back to Washington.  At that point, I don't think President Bush cared what the USSS said. He was ready to get back to DC.
4:15:  POTUS leaves the command center. As he was leaving, we learned of two international flights that weren't responding to the call to turn around and not enter American airspace. Two more missiles we had to worry about. Fortunately, they later responded and turned around.
@BS747 2nd
The President convened a meeting of the National Security Council from Offutt's command center. The room resembled something out of Matthew Broderick movie "Wargames".
We entered the facility through an obscure, small concrete block of an outpost, which I later learned was a fire escape. We descended down, deep into the earth. One of these days I want to return to @Offutt_AFB to go through its front door. https://t.co/26hhKDeSzi
We didn't know how long we would remain at Offutt, although POTUS had no intention of staying long. USSS would have preferred he spent the night there. Bush wanted to get back. Here's the scene: https://t.co/pzUQd71Dkf
When we landed, we parked next to a Doomsday plane. Doomsday planes are modified 747s that, in the Cold War, flew 24/7 as airborne based command posts that could respond to a Soviet attack, even if most land-based assets were destroyed in a Soviet first-strike. https://t.co/gTDRoqf74P
Approx 3:10:  AFOne landed at @Offutt_AFB in Nebraska.
2:58: POTUS to USSS Eddie Marenzel: "We need to get back to Washington. We don't need some tin horn terrorst to scare us off. The American people want to know then their dang President is."  Eddie was the head of the USSS detail in charge of protecting POTUS.

The instructions were to take one tablet twice daily for I don't remember how many days. Dan Bartlett instead took all the pills in his envelope in one fell swoop. Dr. Tubb had to quickly research if what Dan did was dangerous - it wasn't. Dan is still with us today.
At some point in the day, WH physician, Colonel Rich Tubb, was worried about the potential of some sort of biological attack on the travellign party. He gave all of us on AFOne an envelope containing Cipro, an anti-biotic. https://t.co/XsYmrTXsz1
Aboard AFOne, POTUS told the USSS he wanted to get back to DC:		Bush: "I want to go back home ASAP."	Eddie Marenzel, USSS: "Our people are saying it's too unsteady still."	Bush: "Cheney says not safe yet as well."	Andy Card: "The right thing is to let the dust settle."
1:15  We took off from Barksdale, loaded with food and other supplies in case we were gone for days, enroute Offut Air Force Base in Nebraska where Bush could convene a meeting of the National Security Counsel, via secure links.
Six years ago, CSpan did an eight minute segment on what happened on base that day. Apparently, base officials had no idea AFOne was about to land - until we were about to land.  It's worth watching.  https://t.co/28SX1P2hef
Those who stayed behind were later flown back to Washington on a military aircraft.
The five reporters who stayed represented the largest media organizations in the country and they covered all fields of journalism: @sonyagal of AP. @AnnCompton of ABC. @dougmillsnyt a NYT photographer.  One camera man and one sound man. I wish I could recall their names...
One reporter, then with Time Magazine, screamed as we boarded the plane, "Who's in charge?!  The military or civilians!?"  He wasn't happy.
That meant I had to tell 8 type-A personalities that they could no longer travel with the President on the most newsworthy day of their careers.  Some understood.  Some didn't.
We dropped about half the WH staff. Members of Congress were told they'd have to stay behind. I was told to reduce the travelling press pool from 13 to 3.  I told Andy we needed 5.  He said fine, do it.
As we got ready to go, Andy Card decided we need to reduce the number of people on board. We didn't have the usual army of USSS, advance people and military people who fly ahead of POTUS, typically days ahead. All we had was the crew on the plane. Andy didn't want extra people.
Here's the scene as we headed back to AFOne on the tarmac.  That wasn't usual - in fact, I never before and never again saw the military with their weapons out, protecting the plane. https://t.co/8IbqHGkX3T
Before we left Barksdale, Bush addressed the nation, but the speech wasn't live because there was no technology to go live from the base. It was taped and the tapes were then run to local TV outlets to be broadcast.  Here's the address:  https://t.co/GJIbAb69Cp
They asked how I was and as I recall, I told them that since I was travelling with the President, I was in the safest spot on earth. It really never occurred to me to think about any dangers. When you travel with the USSS, you simply don't think about it.
At some point while we were at Barksdale, I slipped out of the General's office to call my parents to be sure they were ok. They lived in a suburb of NYC. They were fine and as far as they knew, we lost no relatives. They later learned about their friends, the Falkenbergs.
Minutes later, the base commander told Bush that intelligence had just come in saying a high speed object was heading for his ranch. Bush ordered its evacuation. This too turned out to be a false report. It was a crop duster.
Bush called Rumsfeld: "It's a day of national tragedy and we'll clean up the mess and then the ball will be in your court and [Incoming Chairman of the Joint Chiefs] Dick Myers court to respond."
Here's the scene in General Keck's office: https://t.co/FeI566j8xY
12:55 Bush called Senator Chuck Schumer of NY: "It's a sad day for America.  Condolences go to everyone in New York.  The government is functioning. We'll come together.  God Bless."
12:40:  It's not clear from my notes whom he said it to, but Bush said, "I can't wait to find out who did it.  It's going to take a while and we're not going to have a little slap on the wrist crap."
POTUS also told the VP:  "It's the new war.  It's the faceless coward that attacks."
@BirthMarkyMark Every day, although not to this level or detail.  But I needed notes to go back and fill my staff in on what they needed to know.
Here's what my notes that I took that day looked like: https://t.co/wIGq6GjZ4l
Bush continued: "Government is not chaotic.  It's functioning smoothly.  We're going to get the bastards."
General Tom Keck led the President into his office where POTUS made calls and he prepared again to address the nation.  He called Cheney: "I think it's important for people to see the government is functioning because the TV shows our nation has been blasted and bombed."
I think I then told the press they were free to report our location.
But as we were arriving, a local TV crew showed our arrival - on live TV. Barksdale was in the middle of a major drill and the local press was there to report it. You can't hide AFOne, and there we were on live TV, which we saw on the plane's TV.
RT @AriFleischer: At around noon eastern, we landed at Barksdale AirForce Base. I remember telling the press where we were going and asking…
At around noon eastern, we landed at Barksdale AirForce Base. I remember telling the press where we were going and asking them not to report it. The USSS did not want POTUS' location to be known. We had a small crew of agents with us and they of course wanted maximum safety.
That meant six missiles in the air. When flight 93 went down in PA, we thought there were now five. A debate ensued about where to go.  POTUS wanted to get back to DC.  The VP and others said not to. The decision was made to got to Barksdale Air Force Base in Louisiana.
When we boarded AFOne, we thought we could return to DC. But that was the last place the USSS wanted POTUS. After the Pentagon was hit, we were told there were six aircraft that didn't respond to the order to land.
Reporter @vermontgmg wrote a superb account of what took place on 9/11 by interviewing scores of people who told him their first-hand accounts. If you want to learn more, it's superb:  https://t.co/6PvYIMgnwz
Here's a scence of what it was like in the President's cabin: https://t.co/eDWgbCFJwO
The President called SecDef Donald Rumsfeld and said, "We're at war Dick and we're going to find out who did this and we're going to kick their ass."
One of the lessons of 9/11 is how much bad information made its way to the top. Normal filters that would stop info from flowing upward were ignored. No one wanted to fail to report a threat. The news reported a car bomb at State &amp;that the Mall was on fire. None of that was true.
A call did come into the Situation Room, where an intelligence officer used the word "Angel" when he transmitted news of the call to the VP.  The VP also used the word "Angel" when he told POTUS.
It amazes me to think that he was so worried, he thought this could be an inside job and took steps to protect against it.		A month or so later, we learned no such call came into the switchboard - at least not one using the word "Angel".
When Col. Tillman (AFOne pilot) heard about the call, he posted an armed AirForce Security officer at the steps to the cockpit. I must have walked past him a dozen times without realizing why he was there. Years later, Tillman told me no one was going to be allowed upstairs.
10:32:  POTUS is on the phone with the VP and he turns to his milaide, saying, "A call came into the switchboard saying, 'Angel is next'."  Angel was the codeword for AirForce One. Very few people are supposed to know that name.
10:28:  The North Tower collapses.
AirForce One is supposed to have the best comms equipment. None of it worked well. We were barely able to watch TV. Reception came and went as we flew above broadcast towers. Even military circuits for the phones were overloaded.
The 9/11 commission was not able to reach a conclusion, but they believe flight 93 was destined to destroy either the Capitol Building or the White House. They don't know which, but they believe it was one or the other.		Imagine if those heores had not taken down that plane.
I was going in and out of POTUS' cabin.  At 10:20am, I was back.		POTUS complained about the communications equipment, as his many of his calls kept getting dropped.  He said he had authorized the shootdown of airplanes if necessary.
10:07  Passengers aboard flight 93, having heard about the other hijackings, try to retake the plane from the hijackers.  The plane crashes into a field in Somerset County, Pennsylvania.
9:59am:  The South Tower collapses.
We took off at an exceptionally sharp, upward angle. Years later, AirForce One pilot, Colonel Mark Tillman, told me he was warned there was a possible sniper at the end of the runway. It turned out to be a USSS counter-sniper. It was the 1st of many false reports we would receive
9:54:  AirForce One takes off, ostensibly for Washington, DC.  There was a debate underway aboard the plane involving the USSS, the military and Andrew Card about where we could or should go.
After hanging up with Cheney, he turned to several of us in his office and said,"That's what we're paid for boys.  We're going to take care of this.  When we find out who did this, they're not going to like me as President.  Somebody's going to pay."
Then he called VP Cheney: "Sounds like we have a minor war going on here. I heard about the Pentagon."		"We're at war" Bush said.  He wouldn't say those words publicly until 9/12 because he wanted to focus on those who lost lives.  But that's what he was thinking.
9:45:  We boarded AirForce One.  Instead of going to my usual seat in my cabin, I spent much of the day in the President's office, taking notes on what he did and said.		As we boarded, he told the USSS to be sure to get the First Lady and his daughters protected.
I later learned that two of my parents' friends lost their son, daughter-in-law and two grandchildren on that flight.  Charles Falkenberg, his wife Leslie Whittington, and their two little girls, Zoe (8) and Dana (3) were lost.
9:37am: Flight 77 crashes into the Pentagon.  The President in the motorcade enrout the airport is informed by either Condi or the head of his USSS detail.  I don't remember who.
@NotWithAnybody White House photographer.  He goes pretty much everywhere the POTUS goes.
@BIGJOEONTHEGO 9:37am:  Flight 77 is flown into the Pentagon.  The President was told about it in the motorcade, either by Condi or the head of his USSS detail.  I don't recall who told him.

9:35: The motorcade departs the Emma Booker Elementary School for the Sarasota Bradenton Airport to board AirForce One.
9:30 Bush addressed the nation for roughly one and a half minutes.  Many commentators criticized the speech for being unsteady and because he used the word "folks" referring to the terrorists.  Here's the speech:		https://t.co/CIWTNUWX8k
https://t.co/U6gUyCiAJy
9:31 am:  The President wanted to address the nation.  The Secret Service (USSS) was anxious to get him out of the school and onto AirForce One.  A speech was previously scheduled to take place in the gym after the reading event. Bush went to the gym and addressed the nation.
Someone brought in a TV and we were able to watch what the rest of the nation was watching.  That's Dan Barlett, Deputy Communications Director, pointing at the TV.  Bush is on a secure phone. https://t.co/cl90P1HnjU
President Bush returned to the holding room. He and the staff worked the phones trying to get more information about what was happening in NYC.  Bush spoke with the VP, Condi, NY @GovernorPataki and FBI Director Bob Mueller. https://t.co/ymTXOWe6Xz
POTUS remained in the schoolroom for some 5 minutes.  Filmmaker Michael Moore and others criticized Bush for not leaving immediately. Bush later said he didn't want to alarm the children, or the nation, by bolting out of his chair. He also wanted to collect his thoughts.
9:05  Chief of Staff Andy Card does something I have never seen before or since.  He walked into a live event and interrputed the President, whispering in his ear: "A second plane hit the second tower.  America is under attack."
Brian Bravo sent me another page, telling me the second tower was hit.  I knew right away it had to be terrorism.  Here's a picture of me receiving that page.  I didn't know this picutre existed until a few years ago.  That's Mike Heath from WH advance next to me. https://t.co/zLcoKjOa0f
9:03am: United Airlines flight 175 is flown into the South Tower.
@ashoklalla Thank you.  Will do.
The President entered the room where he was scheduled to read to the 2nd grade children.  The teacher was named Kaye Daniels.  Here's the scene (I was standing pretty close to the photographer who took this picture): https://t.co/UWn63Dnm43
Condi didn't have a lot of information. The President told her to make all the resources of the US government available to New York City if necessary.  At that moment, it seemed to us it might be a small plane that went off course and crashed.
8:50  Everywhere the President goes, there is a holding room set up with secure phones so he can communicate in case of an emergency. He went into the hold and spoke to National Security Adviser Condi Rice.
I got out of my car and approached POTUSt to inform him of the news. He was shaking hands with school officials who were lined up to greet him as he entered the building. None of them knew the news.  After the President finished shaking hands, Karl Rove told him.
8:50:  As the motorcade pulled into the school, I received a page from Brian Bravo, an assistant in the WH press office, informing me that an airplane crashed into the World Trade Center. There were no Iphones back then.  I had a flip phone and a pager.
8:46am: American Airlines flight 11 is flown into the North Tower of the World Trade Center.
8:41am:  United flight 93 takes off from Newark Airport in New Jersey en route for San Franciso.
8:30am: The motorcade carrying the President leaves the Colony Beach Resort en route the Emma E. Booker Elementary School.  (Note: I earlier tweeted the resort was names Longboat Key.  The Colony was located on Longboat Key.)
8:20am: American Airlines flight 77 takes off from Dulles Airport outside Washington, DC enroute Los Angeles.
8:19am:  Flight attendants on Flight 11 tell report to ground personnel that their plane has been hijacked.
8:14am: United Airlines flight 175 takes off from Boston, also heading for Los Angeles.

President Bush, always an early riser, was up, heading out for a run.  A reporter from Bloomberg, Dick Keil @RDKeil1, was also out for a run and POTUS asked Dick to join him. It was a nice start to what seemed like an ordinary day.
6:30am:  Since we were on the road at the Longboat Key Resort in Sarasota, FL and there was no senior staff meeting, I slept in until 6:30, instead of the usual 5:00am  in DC. It was a stunningly beautiful day. POTUS would leave at 8:30 for a reading event at a local school.

MSM thinks coverage will be deficient if they don’t “supplement progressive white male reporters...w progressive female, black, Latino, Asian, &amp; LGBTQ reporters; but it’s completely fine to build an ideological monoculture...that often views conservatives as morally depraved.”

@BradMossEsq I don’t consider it a campaign expenditure.  It need not be disclosed on a campaign report.
This is why some people want to impeach him. They never accepted the legitimacy of the election. I understand partisan antagonism. But that can never be a reason to impeach. https://t.co/HGFPZyOOWG
@BradMossEsq Campaign funds should NOT be used to pay hush money. I simply don’t consider this a campaign expense. If Trump paid someone hush money tonight, is that a re-election campaign expenditure? I consider it sordid, but personal.
My bottom line is simple: Trump won and the will of the people should not be lightly set aside. I have heard nothing so far that rises to an impeachable offense. The best remedies in a democracy are through the ballot box - not one-party impeachments.
If Trump waited until the Mueller probe was over and then pardoned Manafort, the timing would indicate the pardon was not meant to curry favor. That would put it in a different light. (It would be unwise to pardon a tax cheat, but that’s a different story.)
I also think firing a subordinate officer like Comey is different. Comey had other duties and lost the trust of potus. Mueller’s only job is to investigate Trump. Firing Mueller would be an attempt to interfere with the investigation.
People are asking me why firing/pardoning might make me support impeachment. Here’s why: Trump has the constitutional right to do both, but I believe either one would be obstruction of justice, designed to protect himself. That’s not the purpose of those presidential powers.
@vplus I’d read Mueller’s report.  I’ve long said wait for Mueller.  I’m waiting.
@BradMossEsq He has the constitutional right to pardon and fire, but I believe either one would be obstruction of justice, designed to protect himself. That’s not the purpose of those presidential powers.
@itsYourGrace He has the constitutional right to do both, but I believe either one would be obstruction of justice, designed to protect himself. That’s not the purpose of those presidential powers.
@OHFScratch @bits93 @mdigiov I don’t see paying hush money as a campaign expense.  And it still doesn’t rise to the level of impeachment.  Bill Clinton committed a felony when he lied under oath. Republicans went too far impeaching him. Censuring him would have been wiser.
@bits93 @mdigiov If he waited until after the Mueller probe was over, then that would be different. The pardon then could not be for the purpose of currying inappropriate favor, on the possible assumption that Manafort has damaging info to share with prosecutors.
@mdigiov He has the constitutional right to do both, but I believe either one would be obstruction of justice, designed to protect himself. That’s not the purpose of those presidential powers.
I don’t care for Trump’s style. He can be too offensive &amp; divisive. I like many of his policies. If he fires Mueller/pardons Manafort, I’d consider impeachment. But nothing so far merits impeachment. The remedy 4 those who can’t stand him is political. Beat him in ‘20 if you can.

And that, ladies and gentlemen, is more than anyone needs to know about NDAs.
Media organizations also sometimes ask for NDAs. I recently taped a documentary and the production company insisted I sign an NDA.  It will airl sometime in the future on a major channel.  (I can’t say more because I signed an NDA.)
I also told the WP that comparing Trump to previous presidents isn’t always helpful. He came to DC to be different. While previous presidents didn’t  ask for (or need) NDAs from their staff (other than for those with security clearances), NDAs are common in the business world.
Here is the NDA I signed when I left the WH, promising not to disclose classified info.  I recall signing a similar document when I entered the WH and received my security clearance. https://t.co/6T357nhPRS
On the NDA issue, it’s simple: WH aides with access to classified info sign a form in which they commit not to disclose classified information to unauthorized people. Beyond that, there were no NDAs while I was press secretary.

@samstein Really Sam?  The RNC let Wynn go - he resigned. What exactly has the DNC done?  They haven’t even commented. Why don’t you ask the DNC to take a stand?
@gmukunda Thank you for making my point. The RNC did comment after the Wynn accusations and dismissed Wynn as finance chairman. The DNC hasn’t even commented. Don’t you think the DNC has an obligation to comment on its Deputy Chairman?
@greenfield64 Jeff - the point is not the amount of press coverage. MSM has covered the story. The point is the DNC is silent on an accusation against its Deputy Chair. If Ellison was an R, the press would hold the RNC’s feet to the fire. (Ask Steve Wynn)

@JohnAvlon But that’s not what you reported. You said, “The dossier was initially paid for by Republicans”. Now you say “led to”. The distinction is huge. The unverified, salacious dossier was paid for by Hillary, not the GOP. This isn’t complicated. I think you should just correct it.
I don’t think the press is the “enemy of the people”. I said that the day POTUS claimed they were. But the MSM have become oppositional instead of neutral. They are biased and error-prone against Trump. In the last 24 hours, the NYT and CNN have given Trump a lot to work with.
When CNN runs a “reality check”, as they did yesterday morning claiming that Republicans initially paid for the Steele dossier, they too are giving ammo to Trump when he decries fake news. It’s not too late for CNN to correct its false “reality check”.  cc: @JohnAvlon
The NYT with its double standard is giving Trump ammo as he delegitimizes MSM. NYT is playing into Trump’s hand.

Where do you go when fact checkers have facts wrong?

@CarolLeonnig @DelWilber My point is re how things get covered. Now that a mob is after the press, the press should see things differently when another group is targeted. Often, mobs on campus are just as physically intimidating, if not more so. I hope this opens up eyes to how others are impacted.
@CarolLeonnig @DelWilber Then you and I are on the same page. I don’t like howling mobs, regardless of who they are. Just as I don’t like any effort to physically intimidate the press, I don’t like it to happen to the few conservative speakers who get invited to campuses.

When the heads of the FBI and CIA under Obama tweet partisan messages, you can’t blame Trump for thinking they acted like partisans during the transition. Especially when they briefed him on the dossier-which then leaked. This tweet by Comey is irresponsible. https://t.co/SzW6tMjNnq

@kenklippenstein No one knows.  Wait for Mueller.
Something tells me Trump’s easy acceptance of Putin’s POV will send his critics into an even higher state of hysterics. Trump’s supporters will not be moved. And the few people left in the middle like me think he should have been tougher on Putin, but we’ll wait for Mueller.
That’s why Mueller’s report is important. He needs to let us know if there was collusion. If there was, let the chips land wherever they may. If not, the Ds owe Trump a big apology.
I continue to believe there was no collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia. But when Trump so easily and naively accepts Putin’s line about not being involved, I can understand why Ds think Putin must have the goods on him.
The Secret Service is going to check that ball for listening devices.
The problem w Trump’s approach to Russian interference in our election is he sees it only through the lense of whether he won or lost. He did win, but that shouldn’t blind him to how wrong it was for Russia to interfere. I believe Mueller &amp; the intell community. Trump should too.
Bush had the best Russian translator. Our State Dept translator had a heavy Brooklyn accent.  Nothing beat hearing Bush's Texan translated into Russian with a Brooklyn accent.
I remember when the press would hammer a politician who questioned the patriotism of their opponent. But since the allegation is against Trump, the press looks the other way. It’s this double standard that makes so many, myself included, lose faith in the press. https://t.co/ZZyPbZdRpf

It’s also fair to say that candidate Trump’s “Russia if you’re listening” statement was one of the most foolish and misguided things for a potus candidate to ever say. I suppose it was hyperbole. (The Peter Strzok defense.) But it was wrong to send that signal to Russia.
I’m convinced 1 reason Putin felt he could attack the Ds, &amp;started his efforts in 2014, is bcause Obama was so weak. There was no deterrence. When O told Russia he’d be more flexible after the election and didn’t enforce his Syrian red line, he showed weakness. Putin pounced.
While it won’t lead to any convictions, Mueller’s indictment of 12 Russians is serious. Russia interfered in our election. They stole from us. An attack on one political party should be treated as an attack on all parties. Trump needs to confront Putin and speak out.

Strzok makes an eloquent case about the FBI’s non-political culture. But his bias and animus to Trump run counter to that. If a culture is that strong, it should have extended into his personal emails. It’s hard to believe someone who feels so strongly can be fair professionally.

If anti-Putin, anti-Russia, anti-Trump people want to stand up to Russia, they should be the first to call on NATO nations that have failed to live up to their spending commitments to spend more. But they don’t like being for military spending, so they won’t.
If 27 of the 28 NATO nation’s spent 2% of their GDP on defense and the US was the only nation falling short, the MSM would slam the US. With only 4 of 28 hitting the mark, the MSM shields Europe from criticism. What nonsense. https://t.co/u0XylVlimy

No. Obama is why Trump won.  People wanted change.    As for your not knowing how to quote someone accurately - Europe’s history of broken promises on defense spending did “give rise to Trump”. He is the bull in the china shop because what his predecessors did didn’t work. https://t.co/xNBqodTPlX
If Europe (and its defenders in the US media) don’t like the way Trump is treating them on NATO, they have only themselves to blame. For decades they ignored our “polite” presidents. Their decades-long habit of making empty promises gave rise to Trump. The bill is due.
“George W. Bush’s administration managed to wring a promise from the allies in 2006 that all NATO members would spend at least 2 percent of their gross domestic product on defense.”   It’s been 12 years and Europe is still dragging its feet. https://t.co/eK1vepLGHf

Btw, the Catholic Church doesn’t ordain women as priests.  Orthodox Jews separate men and women during prayers.  Should these practices be struck down?  For those who don’t understand religious liberty’s place in our Constitution, I suppose the answer is yes. https://t.co/qbhhm9L620
The reaction to my tweet is telling, with many on the left comparing the restaurant’s refusal to serve Sarah with a baker refusing to make a cake for a gay marriage. It’s sad but clear that they don’t understand religious liberty. If they don’t get it, you can’t explain it. https://t.co/kSBZCXaX73

@cpm5280 Using informants to get info from an opposing presidential campaign is of course extraordinary.  If the govt authorizes that action and it turns up no crime, the govt should be held to account.
The good news is we’ll find out when Mueller reports. If Mueller has the goods and there was collusion, the O Admin will have turned out to be right.  If no collusion, O will have gone to incredible lengths to interfere with and harm his successor.
@ThePlumLineGS These are generic warnings about Russia. I think it’s fair to ask why Trump wasn’t told of specific concerns about Page, Papadopoulos or  Flynn. I suspect O Admin thought campaign could not be trusted, fearing collusion was real. Instead, they used informants to learn more.
I suspect Eric’s answer is correct. Obama WH and top aides, influenced by confirmation bias, probably did fear the campaign was a criminal enterprise. That’s why Trump wasn’t given specific warnings about infiltration and instead the govt used informants, FISA, unmasking, etc. https://t.co/1yQqHJWL0A

Putting informants into an opposing presidential campaign is fraught w risk and is extraordinary. The press needs to learn exactly when the first informant was authorized. Why? What role did the WH play? And don’t forget the Aug 2016 FBI text saying “The WH is running this.”

@RMontoto Good question. Judaism teaches that in reverence to G-d, his name may never be written where it can be discarded or erased.  It used to apply to parchments and other documents.  With computers, it’s now really a formality and a tradition, all born from reverence and respect.
Until the day comes when we meet G-d, no one knows who’s right or wrong. I know what I believe and I’m proud of it. Meanwhile on earth, I’m grateful to all those who support Israel.
I’m also aware that to a certain extent, faith is not inclusive. In many religions, one must follow and obey various exclusive practices. If you want to get to Heaven, some religions preach, you must do certain things.
For others, it’s about the Bible. For some reason that scares the left and non-religious people.  It doesn’t bother me at all.  As Ed Koch used to say, when you meet the Messiah, ask him if he’s been here before. If he says yes, we Jews were wrong.  If he says no, we were right.

@arthistorynews That’s an entirely different point and it has nothing to do with the FEC.  It is a matter I suspect every voter thought was a very good possibility with Trump.
@JakeSherman There is no legal limit on personal spending. If a candidate goes on vacation in August to rest up for the Fall push, is there a limit on how much they can spend?  No.  And they must use personal funds, not campaign funds, even though rest benefits the campaign.
If paying Stormy in October is an illegal, undisclosed campaign expenditure, then why isn’t Stormy coming forward in October saying she wanted to go public an illegal, undisclosed in-kind contribution to Hillary?
Campaign money is not supposed to be used for personal purposes.  Saying Stormy’s payment is an FEC violation makes a mockery of the rules stating campaign money may not be used for personal purposes.
I don’t see how the Stormy $130,000 payment issue is an FEC matter. Think about this: a candidate for the Senate in 2018 pays hush money to a woman. (Legal transaction) Is he supposed to do that w campaign funds or personal funds?  Of course the answer is personal funds.
Bernie Sanders also was fined by the FEC.  The press didn’t make a big deal of FEC violations, until now, when Trump is the issue.  https://t.co/aQn3z8ICOh

3) I’ve said it before and I’ll say it again: there were no angels on the ballot in 2016. Trump was not elected for his ethics. Everyone knows he is flawed. That’s why despite the hysterics, I doubt this will hurt Trump.
2) As for the “shock” that POTUS didn’t know, why does anyone think this is the first time he and his personal attorney have done this? It wouldn’t surprise me in the least if there were previous NDAs that Cohen routinely set up as Trump’s “fixer”. This likely is nothing new.
On Rudy’s revelations: 1) POTUS was not forthright when he withheld info from the press aboard AFOne. He may not literally have known what Cohen did when he did it, but he knew about his own reimbursements. Add Trump to the list of Presidents who were not fully honest about sex.

Bush responded that he appreciated the compliment about his father, and then added, “but don’t forget I got half my mother in me too.”		RIP Mrs. Bush.  Your grace, charm and wit will be missed.

@joshscampbell As the spokesman for the FBI, you of course represent and assist the Director. I respect your career and your opinions.  But particularly when you discuss your former boss’s book, CNN should give viewers more disclosure - which is what CNN stressed this morning.

This morning I watched cnn’s morning show decry FOX for insufficient disclosure by Hannity.  They then had a panel to discuss Comey’s book, featuring Comey’s former spokesman. Yet that’s not how CNN identified him.
On the topic of disclosure, this has been on my mind for a while: CNN has three reporters/contributors whose roles they should more thoroughly disclose.  I’m a FOX contributor and I used to be a CNN contributor.  I like watching both news shows.
On the Sean Hannity flap: I think Sean would have strengthened his hand if he had disclosed his legal relationship with Michael Cohen, although more has been made out of this than warranted. The legal link between the two appears thin.
This is brilliant.  It’s also a reminder that most Americans, especially low- and middle-income earners, get their payroll taxes returned to them when they retire.  In fact, most get back more than they put in.  That’s how it works. https://t.co/HJqv8w5hKY

As FBI Director, Comey’s opinions have value. But he has not presented any new facts. He hasn’t made any revelations - other than offering negative opinions of Trump.  This isn’t a tell-all. It’s an opinion-all.  		Comey has the right to his opinions. But that’s all he gave us.
I 100% agree with Comey on impeachment. The future should not be externally forced.  It’s up to the voters in 2018 and 2020.  If people don’t like Trump, vote him out. If he’s doing a good job and people like him, vote him in. That’s how our system is supposed to work.
If Trump told Comey “he hoped he could drop the Flynn investigation”, that was improper. It was also wrong, though not in as direct a fashion, when Obama said Hillary and the IRS didn’t commit crimes. Presidents shouldn’t opine about specific pending criminal cases.
@BDayspring False info is even worse.  Unless you think there are no leaks or rumors in Washington.
Trump was wrong if he asked Comey for loyalty. But make no mistake, if Hillary had won she would have fired Comey on 1/20/17. Then she and her staff would have made certain whoever she nominated to replace him would be loyal to her. She’s smart enough not to ask directly.
George let Comey slide by not probing more into why Comey felt he needed to announce that no reasonable prosecutor would indict.  Comey never should have usurped DoJ’s role in deciding whether or not to indict. Comey protected DoJ. He should not have done so.
If investigators prefer informal interviews instead of grand juries, as Comey said he did with Hillary, then why is Mueller doing the opposite with Trump?  It still seems like the FBI and DoJ rolled over for Hillary, while Mueller is being tough with Trump.
Did it ever occur to Comey that one consequence of the dossier briefing he gave Trump was that Trump would conclude Comey has dirt on the President-elect and, like J Edgar Hoover, Comey would want a controlling relationship with the POTUS?

@rolandsmartin @Starbucks Roland - read all three of my tweets.  You read it wrong.
@SageRosenfels18 I didn’t “blame” them. We’ve all been to fast food outlets.  If management asks you to place an order, you should. They all have policies about using the rest room. That’s why I asked does this Starbucks treat all its customers the same way. I suspect no and that’s the problem.
@SageRosenfels18 Sage - you must have been sacked a few too many times. Read all my tweets on this, in the order I made them.
@SrikanthTalagad @jhornburg01 Go back to my first tweet.  That’s why I said arresting these guys was terrible. 	But it is worth learning all the facts that lead up to this. 	But no matter what, a better outcome would have been for a cop, or another guest, to buy the men a cup of coffee. Defuse. Don’t escalate
Why did this so quickly escalate to leave or get arrested?		Starbucks, the police and the two guests could have used more reason.  Just place an order and all this goes away. I don’t see anyone on the video saying that. This should have been defused. https://t.co/fxWFYhoEHk

@myry45 Sorry.  Sometimes the right answer is for the police to say to the complainant there is no problem and no crime. That’s what should have been done here.  I get the police often have to make tough judgment calls.  That wasn’t the case here.

By the Fall, the shot of Bush with the banner became a symbol of what went wrong.   And now you know the full story.
It was the crew’s message from start to finish.  It also was the backdrop for Bush’s speech.  In May 2003, everyone thought the mission had been accomplished.  The insurgency did not fully develop until the Fall of 2003.  The WH press corps in May did not criticize the banner.
After Bush left the ship and we took with us all the trappings of the presidency, the banner remained up.  It was still up when the Abraham Lincoln pulled into its home port in Washington State.
In his remarks, Bush stated the danger was not over and that difficult missions lay ahead, particularly in the Sunni triangle.    The nuance of his remarks, however, couldn’t compete with the message of this banner.
The crew asked the WH staff if it would be ok to hang a banner saying “Mission Accomplished”.  We readily agreed.  We hung it in an obviously prominent place that also sent a message as Bush spoke to the nation.
After our advance crew boarded the ship in Hawaii days prior to Bush’s landing on the USS Abraham Lincoln, the Navy crew told us they were returning from the longest deployment of any ship in Naval history.  They were proud of what they had done.
It’s obviously too late and I get the symbolism that came back to bite us months later when the  war turned and the insurrection grew, but there is an interesting back story to the “Mission Accomplished” story.
I listened to CNN in the 5:00 hour last night.  They gave the IG report about McCabe two sentences.  One of the two was his lawyer defending him.
Both the NYT &amp; WP put on the front page a story about someone no one has heard of, Elliott Broidy, for paying off a mistress. Both papers buried a story about someone everyone has heard of, former FBI Dep Director Andew McCabe, who was found found to have lied 3 times under oath.

@MarkSZaidEsq @joshscampbell You're both missing the importance of public buy-in for what Mueller does. It is more likely that this ends up in Congress, not in court. As someone who has defended Mueller because I know him, my point is he needs to wrap us soon, or he risks becoming a permanent prosecutor.
@joshscampbell He doesn't have all day however, especially after his extraordinary referral, vis-a-vis Cohen. America doesn't have permanent presidential prosecutors. If he doesn't wrap it up soon, and then explain it, he risks taking on the air of a permanent prosecutor.
When Trump fired Comey, he told Lester Holt his action would "lengthen out the investigation." If he fires Meuller, it won't end the investigation - it will lengthen it even more. If Trump wants this to go away, the smart move is to let Mueller finish and find no collusion.
@joshscampbell If Mueller's findings are going to have bipartisan acceptance, he will need to make the case for what he finds and doesn't find. This is bigger than a simple court case. Violating lawyer-client privilige is extraordinary. It makes people wonder why. Mueller will need explain.

@svdate It’s not my interpretation. It’s public opinion, which by a significant majority agreed the economy and nation was on the wrong track. Again, you keep trying to change topics away from your original tweet. There is plenty of evidence to support Trump’s statement.
@svdate But in this instance, it was your tweet that misstated facts.  		There is plenty of evidence to support the statement that under Pres. Obama the economy was heading in the wrong direction. 		You are so quick to blame Trump that you erred.
@svdate Then you should have tweeted that.  That is not what you tweeted.
@svdate The bigger issue is how oppositional your reporting is. I fault Trump when he deserves it and I credit him too. You mostly oppose, even if it means you have to distort/ignore data you don’t accept. 		The oppositional nature of the media is doing great harm to journalism.

The fair way to abolish it is to set the effective date after the next election, since no one knows who will control the Senate.  But the bottom line is the filibuster leads to disfunction and it rewards those who block and oppose. Majority rule is the right way. Always.
Now the minority party filibusters each bill, forcing a vote on one giant bill in order to gain leverage on the outcome.  No one can read it because it’s so big and if it’s not signed, government shuts down.  That’s an abuse of the filibuster.  It needs to be abolished.
When I worked in Congress, they passed passed 13 individual appropriation bills, one at a time. (Now it’s 12 bills).  As each one passed, different pieces of government got their money, and therefor weren’t subject to a shutdown.
POTUS is 100% right about the need to abolish the filibuster.  It’s the cause on these giant, no one reads them, omnibus bills, that, if not signed, shut down the government. The filibuster is being misused and should be abolished.

The Russians wanted to help Trump and Bernie, and harm Hillary, Cruz &amp; Rubio. Its purpose was to "sow discord". 		Just like during the Cold War, our best response is to unite and counter-attack. Trump needs to find something dear to Putin, and to hack it/sanction it.
One of the ironies of this indictment is that the Russian effort began in 2014, under the nose of Obama Admin officials, one year prior to Trump declaring his candidacy. Russians targeted Hillary, and the Administration Hillary served in failed to see it coming or to stop it.
The report knocks the legs out from the Democrats' most serious charge - that Trump colluded.		If there was collusion, it would have been made known today. Next time Adam Schiff talks, remember, he makes things up.  If he is right about collusion, why is there NO evidence?
Today's announcement is mostly good news/some bad news for POTUS.		Good news is no collusion was found. If there was collusion, it likely would have been revealed today.		Bad news is the President has never flat out said Russia interfered in our election. He should say so now.

As for President Trump's vindication tweet, my belief is he will ultimately be right. There was no collusion. However, vindication is not his to declare, certainly not yet. Mueller can declare it. The majority of the public can declare it. That's how it should work.
One reason the public doesn't trust Washington is the sense that both parties try to gain unfair advantage over each other. Fair is fair. The Rs released their memo, which had important points to it. The Ds should be able to also release theirs. Let the public be the judge.

It’s also pretty rotten of the FBI is they used a Yahoo story spun to Yahoo by Christopher Steele as a reason to wiretap an American. Two things can be true at once: Mueller should investigate collusion AND the FBI misled the FISA court.  Abuse of power does happen.
As for the clash between Rs who say McCabe testified that without the dossier the fbi would not have gone to FISA and the Ds who say McCabe never said that, release that portion of McCabe’s testimony.  Someone is telling the truth.  Let’s see who it is.
The memo: 1) It’s not as devastating as advertised, but the allegation the FBI in part relied on the dossier for a FISA warrant is very troubling. 2) Why was it classified? I didn’t see anything sensitive in it. 3) Why did Ds say it revealed sources &amp; methods.  It didn’t.

If history is a guide, the Dem Presidential primary will kick off in just one year. Two years into his 1st term as a US Senator, Barack Obama announced his presidential candidacy in Feb 2007.  For this cycle, that’s one year from now. (Hill and Bernie announced in April 2015)

In order for this to become a trend, Trump needs his approval rating to grow to above 50%. Red state Ds can defy him if he’s in the 30s, or low-to-mid 40s nationwide. The key to his success is growing his base - and not committing any more unnecessary roughness penalties.
Almost all Ds thinking about running for potus voted no. Almost all red state Ds voted yes. If this becomes a trend, it will be a seachange in DC and Trump will keep winning.

@davidgregory I think that’s the heart of it now. It should be easily compromised, if there is the will. It can’t be an authorization. It must be an appropriation. Ds can call it a fence. Rs a wall. In exchange for reform, Bush would do a partial wall. He however, wouldn’t have run on a wall.
If I live in another country now, and DACA passes without security, why shouldn’t I conclude I can illegally bring my kids to America and demand they too get DACA one day. What makes America a nation people WANT to immigrate to is that we ARE a nation of laws.
I’m proud 2be a George W. Bush comprehensive immigration reform Republican. I’m the son of a (legal) immigrant. I want DACA kids to stay, but ONLY if border security, including a wall, is passed. Without security, people will keep coming illegally. No one should want DACA 2.0

Individual appropriation bills would pass easily if there was no filibuster. Most aren’t controversial. Almost all government would be funded. Nothing wrong w fighting over big issues (DACA and the Wall), but those fights shouldn’t tie up rest of government. End the filibuster.
Shutdowns could easily be avoided by abolishing the filibuster for appropriation bills. When I worked in the Senate, it was routine for each individual appropriation bill to get a vote (50 votes to pass). Now, no bills pass. They’re all lumped together, and require 60 votes.

@lachlan Agreed. But since leaving DC, one of most frustrating things 2watch is how “insider” coverage is.  Average voter has hard time learning the truth when anonymous sources, saying juicy things, can get away with it. One party, on record, denies. Anon source alleges. Public is lost.
This is a good point. Those who anonymously told the press Trump said it should go public. If what you said is accurate, why the need for anonymity? (It wouldn’t surprise me if source(s) is/are Republican. That’s why they won’t go public.) Anonymity does not help find the truth. https://t.co/s4e7nb1oMb
@MarianCutler Yes.  And that’s why I criticized what he said.  But in fairness, when one party on the record denies something, it’s only fair to make the “other side” go public.  Anonymity does not help the public learn the truth.
On Hannity last night, relying on press accounts of what potus said, I criticized Pres Trump’s sh*thole remark, saying it was hurtful. Today he denied saying it. The press should get those who say he said it to go on the record. It would help the public learn the truth.

If evidence emerges that Trump/his campaign colluded w Russia to hack DNC/Podesta, Trump will deserve whatever punishment, legal or political, he gets. But if there’s no evidence, Flynn, Manafort will be criminal sideshows. Critics will be wrong re biggest issue that matters.
@ShaneOSD1 If Flynn has proof, then Trump lied and deserves what he’ll get.  If there isn’t proof, then Trump’s critics should recognize there very well may be no collusion.
@y2wen It is normal and appropriate for an incoming NSA to talk to foreign leaders, including Russians, during a transition. But Flynn lied about his contacts, to Pence and to the FBI. It also, IMO, would be inappropriate to negotiate sanctions. We have one POTUS at a time.
It’s hard to see how this could involve collusion to hack the DNC/Podesta or to collude in dissemination of Hillary’s emails since the contact took place in December 2016 - after the election.
The issue here is Brian and ABC News reported that “Trump” directed Flynn to contact the Russians. Other media report that “Trump transition officials” directed Flynn. Big difference. (And it still may be legal, regardless. But if it was to negotiate sanctions, it was foolish.) https://t.co/c9B9vSSZZW

It reminds me when he tweeted flag burning should b a crime. MSM said he was appealing to his base.  Instead, polls showed 75% agreed w him.
Politically however, it's a winner for Trump.
The government should not say who gets fired in the private sector.  I also prefer sports and politics not to mix.

It's good to see POTUS and Congress wrangle over things like laws, substance and policy.  This is what governing is supposed to look like.

Amazingly, USSS had their long guns out next 2the bunker. In the safest spot inside the WH, they took no chances. Still seems hard 2believe.
After the speech was over I walked w POTUS to the bunker under the WH where the Nat. Sec. Council would meet.

The reporters in FL had to take a bus back.  It took a couple days.  The reporters at Barksdale were luckier - the Air Force flew them back.
I went back to my office and briefed the small number of reporters who didn't make the trip to FL. Their colleagues were stranded. https://t.co/1LF3T1WOSF
The President then went back to the Mansion to see Mrs. Bush and to prepare for his speech.
The President went straight into his private study off the Oval Office to talk with Karen Hughes and Condi about his speech that night. https://t.co/5DjMVV5mYp
6:58  We landed on the WH lawn.  Here's a picture and a video.	https://t.co/BUAyxTPwoB https://t.co/hC8WnH5vPc
"The mightiest building in the world is on fire. That's the 21st century war you just witnessed."
As the Pentagon came into sight, Pres. Bush said aloud, to no one in particular:
We flew over the Capitol, straight down the Mall and banked right at the Washington Monument so we could land on the WH South Lawn.
Around 6:45, we landed back at Andfrews Air Force Base and boarded Marine One for the short flight back to the WH.
"Everyone must understand, this will not stand.  No one is going to diminish the spirit of this country."
"We will find these people and they will suffer the consequences of taking on this nation.  We will do what it takes."
On the flight back to DC, Pres Bush called Karen Hughes to review what he wanted to say in his speech to the nation that night.
"I'm coming home.  See you at the WH. If I'm in the WH and there's a plane coming my way, all I can say is I hope I read my Bible that day."
4:30 President Bush call Mrs. Bush:
Minutes later, we got an update saying they both turned around.
As we're leaving, we got reports of two intercontinental flights, one from Europe and from Asia, that didn't respond to order to turn back.
4:26  Bush left the bunker, turned to his milaide and said he's going back to Washington.
@sonyagal Sorry Sonya!  Check with Dr. Tubb.
@tgriff716 Six 8 x 14 legal pages.
@KarenMacklen For the staff.
Bush was briefed by the CIA, FBI, Pentagon and others. Given the technology then, it was 1st time everyone could gather on one secure line.
I learned years later that we entered through an emergency exit stairwell.  One of these days I want to walk through Offutt's front door.
To get to the bunker down below where Bush would convene the Nat. Sec. Council, we entered this very small concrete block of a building. https://t.co/1z8qhvijiT
Here is the scene as we walked toward the entrance of the base. https://t.co/PGKcivXCNs
Staff was told to prepare for spending the night on base. The USSS still preferred for POTUS to remain out of DC.  Bush thought otherwise.
We would be able to coordinate our retaliation from these aircraft if necessary. With the Soviet Union gone, we don't fly them much anymore.
If a Soviet (or Chinese) first strike took out most/all of our ground based command &amp; control centers, these planes would survive.
During the Cold War, the Air Force flew a fleet of Doomsday planes (modified 747s) 24/7/365 in case there was a nuclear war. https://t.co/BsEYDkqLaq
We landed at Offutt little after 3:00 and parked next to a Doomsday plane. Hollywood never would have thought of that. https://t.co/qSQSbiyn0l
"The American people want to know where their dang President is."
"We need to get back to Washington. We don't need some tin horn terrorist to scare us off."
Just before we landed at Offutt, Bush turned to Eddie Marinzel, the head of his USSS detail and said:
Bush also warned both about the possibility of a second wave of attacks.  The CIA concluded there would be more attacks coming.
"Anything we can do to help, you let me know."
"Our sympathies are with you and the people of NY. I know you're heart is broken and your city is strained."
2:25  Bush calls Mayor Giuliani and Gov. Pataki:
@evanmgoldberg https://t.co/dCF27Q2Ik4
USSS: "Our people are saying it's too unsteady still."	Bush: "Cheney says not safe yet as well."	Andy:"Right thing is 2let the dust settle."
1:25 on AFOne.  Bush: "I want to go back home ASAP. I don't want whoever this is holding me outside of Washington."
I wasn't allowed to tell the press where we were going.
Around 1:15, we were wheels up for Offut Airforce Base in NE, where Bush could convene a meeting of the Nat. Security Council on secure TV.
But we didn't have our usual infrastructure or security.  We didn't have time for extra people.
I felt bad for the press.  It was the most newsworthy day of their lives and they were being left behind.
The reporters left behind were furious.  One screamed, "Who's in charge?!  The military or the civilians!?"
I told my aide Gordon Johndroe to invite the reporters from the biggest outlets. That meant @AnnCompton, @sonyagal, @dougmillsnyt and 2 more
I asked Andy to make it 5 reporters and he said fine, just do it.
Andy said it also meant that we needed to shrink the 13-member WH press pool to 3 people.
Before boarding AFOne, Andy Card said non-essential personnel had to stay. That meant all the Congressmen and 1/2 the WH staff couldn't go.
Here is Bush's second address to the nation that day.  From Barksdale.  (two minutes long)  https://t.co/mrQbzNgOLF
Bush had a staffer call to evacuate the ranch.  Turned out to be a crop-duster.  Just another of many false alarms that day.
As Bush was leaving to address the nation, Gen. Keck told him intell just came in about a high speed object heading toward Bush's ranch.
"It's a day of national tragedy and we'll clean up the mess and then the ball will be in your court and Dick Myer's court to respond."
Bush called Def. Sec Donald Rumsfeld and said, referring to the incoming chairman of the Joint Chiefs:
Bush called NY Sen. Chuck Schumer:  "It's a sad day for America.  Condolences go to everyone in NY.  We'll come together.  God Bless."
"I can't wait to find out who did this.  It's going to take a while and we're not going to have a little slap on the wrist crap."
Bush continued his calls from the Base Commander's office.  He turned to staff and said:
"The country looks to the President on occasions like this 2b reassuring to the nation. Some Presidents do it well, some Presidents don't."
Jennings: "I don't mean to say this in melodramatic terms, but where is the President? Pretty soon the country needs to know where he is."
Meanwhile, Peter Jennings on ABC and Brian Williams on MSNBC criticized Bush for not returning to DC.
Bush then said to Cheney: "It's the new war.  It's the faceless coward that attacks."
"Government is not chaotic.  It's functioning smoothly.  We're going to get the bastards."
Calls VP: "I think it's important 4the people to see the government is functioning because the TV shows our nation has been blasted&amp;bombed."
12:25  Bush is in the Base Commander's (Lt. Gen. Tom Keck) office working the phones.
@yashar According to Politico, Andy Card said Col. Tillman wasn't flying back to DC no matter what.  "I'm in charge of this plane," Tillman said.
Here's the scene on the runway at Barksdale.  We never have security like this. https://t.co/e0StWHSpf1
Btw, this Politico story is a superb recap of what happened that day. https://t.co/csBzwMKfIS via @politicomag
So much for keeping our destination a secret.  We landed around 12:05pm eastern.
As i was talking, the TVs showed local coverage of the plane landing at Barksdale. Local media was there to cover the drill underway.
As we were about to land, I went to the press cabin to brief.  I told reporters they could not divulge our location.
Before we landed, the WH medical office distributed Cipro to the staff, just in case we had been hit by a biological attack. https://t.co/l9miVPDtnb
As we approached, we were escorted by F-16 fighter aircraft. (I don't know if this photo was enroute Barksdale or another time on that day.) https://t.co/dSp1c8Lpmu
Barksdale was in the middle of a major military exercise and was on high alert.  No one was supposed to know we were going there.
We needed to refuel, unload non-necessary passengers, pick up more food and POTUS wanted to address the nation.
The decision was made to not go back to DC, but instead land at Barksdale Air Force Base in Louisiana.
Here's more of the scene on the plane.  The first two are in POTUS's office.  The third is his bedroom off the office.  It's a nice plane. https://t.co/fA5MmX961Q
USSS later told Politico, "[Bush] fought with us tooth and nail all day to go back to Washington. We basically refused to take him back."
The military drills for how to survive a decapitation attack.  They implemented several response measures that day, esp to keep POTUS safe.
Worst case scenario was this was an attempt to decapitate the government, and that an insider might be involved.
Colonel Tillman later told Politico that was something that had never been done before.
Col. Tillman ordered Will Chandler of Air Force Security, to stand watch at base of steps leading up to the cockpit.  No one was allowed up.
Comms were dropping, AFOne had been threatened and nation was under attack. USSS and Col. Tillman were worried about an inside job.
Even military communications were too jammed that day.  It led to a major technological overhaul of AFOne.
Amazingly, as Bush would talk on the phone, the phone connection frequently was dropped.  That's not supposed to happen on that plane. https://t.co/7OdMLKc86m
10:42 Bush is told his daughters are in "hardened location." Bush: "How did they take it?" USSS: "They wanted to stay in their apartments."
Here's the scene in Bush's cabin as the security people are trying to decide where to fly. https://t.co/0Rd7sZg6Ik
Bush calls Cheney:  "We're at war Dick and we're going to find out who did this and we're going to kick their ass."
When flight 93 crashed in PA, the first report we got is it crashed "near Camp David."  It was about 100 miles away.
By then, we had heard media report of a car bomb at State Dept/the mall was on fire.  We were also told there were six hijacked aircraft.
10:32  POTUS was told of a call that came into the WH switchboard saying, "Angel is next".  Angel was the code word for AFOne.
Our plan was to return to DC, but the VP/USSS thought that was a terrible idea.  We headed up to 45,000 feet and flew in a random pattern.
10:28  The North Tower collapsed.
As the reception would come and go, we could watch TV to get news of what was happening.  It was frustrating.  AFOne now has satellite TV.
We didn't have satellite TV on AFOne.  When we flew over major cities, the TV reception came in depending on strength of a broadcast tower.
It turns out the "sniper" was one of ours.  Part of the USSS counter-sniper team.  It was one of many false alarms that day.
We took off at an unusually sharp incline and way faster than normal. AFOne Pilot Mark Tillman later told me there was a report of a sniper.
2/2  "When we find out who did this, they're not going to like me as President.  Somebody's going to pay."
1/2   Bush turns to the staff with him and says, "We're at war.  That's what we're paid for boys.  We're going to take care of this."
9:59  The South Tower collapses.
Cheney told Bush there were still 3 aircraft missing.  We knew 3 hit targets and thought there were still more attacks coming.
He called VP: "Sounds like we have a minor war going on here. I heard about the Pentagon."
POTUS told his lead USSS agent, Eddie Marinzel, to be sure to get his wife and daughters protected.  He didn't have time to call them yet.
9:45  I boarded AFOne with POTUS and spent much of the day in his cabin.  I took verbatim notes of what he did and what he said. https://t.co/XkYMm6PiQA
9:45 The Capitol and the WH were evacuated.  WH aides were told by USSS to run, not walk. Women were told to take off their heels and run.
9:42  The Federal Aviation Administration for the first time in history grounded all flights into, out of, and over the U.S.
Sonya Ross of Associated Press later told Politico that bomb sniffing dogs "were drooling all [over] the luggage."  No one objected.
Even though the press had already been cleared by USSS, they and staff had all belongings searched before being let onto AFOne. https://t.co/ajOYxYv3VR
The President was told about the attack on the Pentagon in his limo enroute to Air Force One.  I heard about it when I boarded the plane.
9:37  American flight 77 crashes into the Pentagon, killing 59 aboard the plane and 125 inside the Pentagon.
9:36  Over DC, American flight 77 turned west and began to circle back.  USSS evacuates VP Cheney to the bunker under the WH.
There are always 2 identical limos in the motorcade. USSS played a shell game moving them around so it would be hard 2know which held POTUS.
9:35  Bush departs Emma Booker school for Air Force One.  USSS asked for triple blockades at intersections.  Not just motorcycle units.
Seconds later, tower told USSS the aircraft was turning south, away from the WH.
9:33  Reagan airport tower calls Secret Service (USSS) 2say "an aircraft is coming at you and not talking to us." That was 1st threat to WH.
Bush called it "an apparent terrorist attack."  The press later faulted his remarks, saying he appeared unsteady.  https://t.co/t0JdHRst7A
9:31  Bush spoke briefly to a gathering of teachers &amp;kids in the gym. The Secret Service wanted to leave. Bush wanted to address the nation.
Here is more of the scene in the hold. https://t.co/5PAsogArwo
A TV was brought into the room and POTUS watched replays of the planes hitting the towers. https://t.co/2fmA2wB9to
The President went back into the hold to work the phones, speaking with VP, FBI Director, Condi and others. https://t.co/F9Yi36L131
Michael Moore later made a move sharply critical of Pres. Bush for remaining in the room.
Bush remained in room 4 a few minutes, "listening" to the kids read, collecting his thoughts. The teacher&amp;kids had no idea what was going on
Chief of Staff Andy Card entered the room, interrupted POTUS, and whispered "A second plane hit the second tower. America is under attack."
Here is a picture of me getting a second page about the second plane.  That's how I learned about it. Advance man Mike Heath is next to me. https://t.co/4JR1aHzPJo
9:03  United Airlines Flight 175 is flown into the South Tower, killing all on board and hundreds more in the tower.
Pres Bush spoke with Condi Rice.  No one knew yet if it was terrorism.
Everywhere POTUS goes, the military sets up a secure room w classified phones. I had never seen it used until that morning.
After POTUS shook hands with school officials, Karl Rove told him what happened.  POTUS immediately went into a "holding room" to get info.
There was no more info than that.  We didn't know if it was an accident or something else.
The page was sent to me by Brian Bravo, a young aide in the WH press office.  He heard about it bcause a friend in NYC called him.
We pulled into the school and I got a page telling me a plane hit the WTC.  Pagers were the fastest forms of instant messaging back then.
8:46  Hijacked American Airlines Flight 11 is flown in2 the World Trade Center, killing everyone on board. Hundreds were killed in the tower
8:41  United Airlines flight 93 with 44 people on board takes off from Newark for San Francisco.
8:30  Motorcade departs our hotel for the Emma E. Booker Elementary School. Here are the vehicle assignments. My car was called "Support" https://t.co/UF7uenBL8f
8:20   American Airlines flight 77 takes off from Dulles outside D.C. with 64 people aboard for LA.
Here is the cover of POTUS's schedule.  It's called a "mini".  It's a detailed, minute by minute logistical guide. It fits in your pocket. https://t.co/tF2Vl0axBU
8:14am  United Airlines flight 175 with 65 people on board takes off from Boston, also heading for LA.
American Airlines flight 11 with 92 people aboard departs Logan Airport for Los Angeles.
He then had his CIA briefing. The 2nd Intifata was underway so much of it was focused on the violence in the West Bank in Israel.
President Bush started his day with a run. He spotted a reporter, Dick Keil of Bloomberg, who was also a runner, and asked him to join him.
It was a gorgeous, clear day up and down the east coast.  It couldn't have been more beautiful, especially in NYC.
It was a gorgeous day at the Colony Resort in Sarasota, FL. POTUS was scheduled to do an event at a local school to talk about education.
I woke up probably around or 6:00 (late for the WH, but we weren't scheduled to board the motorcade until after 8:00.)
There was no Twitter then. But I will try to re-live history on twitter so others can know details of what happened behind the scenes.

7/ But it should have started w POTUS directly taking on the Klan and the Nazis.
6/ If BLM or Antifa engaged in violence, and it looks like they did, they too deserve condemnation by name.
5/ Yes, even the Klan and Nazis have a right in the US to peacefully march and assemble.
4/ Evil should be morally confronted directly. POTUS should have condemned them by name.
