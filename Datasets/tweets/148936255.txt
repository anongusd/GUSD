President Trump’s decision to give $10 million to fortify the Ukrainian navy drew little more enthusiasm than a lump of coal from Baltic officials alarmed by Russian aggression. https://t.co/qhZiulCBc2

So, what might look like a turf war between priests in a church on the far side of the world has some low-key significant foreign policy significance for Americans. Now the question is, what happens next? https://t.co/O3GlQBp8ty
And, of course, the conflict touched off a crisis between Western-Russian relations, as U.S./EU sanctioned Russia over the annexation of Crimea and fighting in eastern Ukraine. https://t.co/34CTt0uasz
That man, "a Ukrainian army priest, was once loyal to the Moscow Patriarchate but changed his allegiance to the Kiev Patriarchate after the Russian-affiliated church began refusing to hold funerals for Ukrainian soldiers who died fighting in eastern Ukraine," @AP explains.
But the Ukrainians pushed ahead today, by choosing the person who will be the leader of the new Ukrainian church -- "we should have our own church, not an agent of the Kremlin in Ukraine," as one priest at the council said Sunday. https://t.co/Jv2hEeSwBo
"that could open the door for Russian intervention, which they could call peacekeeping,” @ValpoU's @NickDenysenko told @dcexaminer https://t.co/yVp4SJl8M7
The Russian Patriarch Kirill alleged that Ukraine's government is persecuting the clergy in the country by pressuring them to go along with the change. And the charge of persecution dovetails with fears that the Kremlin will move to "protect" Orthodox believers in Ukraine
The Russian government is angry. “The idea behind this is obvious — another step in tearing Ukraine from Russia, not just politically, but also spiritually,” Russian Foreign Ministery Sergey Lavrov said in October.
(The Baltic diplomat adds that the patriarch of the Russian Orthodox Church is widely perceived as 'KGB-connected' due to "the way the Russian Orthodox Church tries to support Russia’s aggression”) https://t.co/yVp4SJl8M7
The Eastern Orthodox Church doesn't have a pope, but they have patriarchs of various churches. The most prestigious is Patriarch Bartholomew of Constantinople, who backs formation of national Ukrainian church over the objections of the Patriarch of the Russian church
“There's no doubt that the Russian Orthodox Church was one of the main tools in the toolbox of Kremlin," a Baltic diplomat told @dcexaminer https://t.co/yVp4SJl8M7
So, when Putin talks about defending ethnic Russians, or Orthodox Christians, i Ukraine, he's drawing on that ideology that church leaders have advanced. Beyond ideology, the bureaucracy of the Russian Orthodox Church was useful even in the Ukraine conflict
“Ukraine is absolutely key to this Russian world ideology,” @ValpoU ’s Nicholas Denysenko told @dcexaminer. That has practical significance as well, per Baltic and U.S. officials. The Kremlin uses 'the Russian Orthodox Church as a geopolitical tool,' per @StateDept
About half of the Russian Orthodox Church -- 12,000 congregations or so -- are in Ukraine. Symbolic significance: Moscow church leaders leadership 'revived an imperial ideology' post-USSR, casting 'Russia as the protector of all things eastern'   https://t.co/yVp4SJl8M7

Pompeo tried to instill more certainty in Brussels, even as he criticized multilateral blocs that fail to meet their goals. 'This is an indispensable institution,' he said of @NATO. 'NATO allies should work to strengthen what is already the greatest military alliance' in history
But @SecPompeo would have a hard time calming European nerves if Mattis were to leave or get fired, @AndersFoghR also said: “If he were to be sacked, that would be an indication that the U.S. government doesn't feel as committed to Article V as in the past."
"I have to say that, first of all, the president is surrounded by very good and reasonable people in the security team,” he added. “Mattis, of course knows NATO in and out ... and Pompeo, Bolton -- all those people have, in my opinion, the right approach.” https://t.co/ORqJFLx43I
Pompeo's scheduling of exit from INF Treaty might look like china-breaking by Trump administration, but @AndersFoghR sees value there, too. “Personally, I think the U.S. threat is the right step at this moment,” he said. “I don’t think that my view represents the general view.”
Former NATO Secretary General Anders Fogh Rasmussen corroborated Pompeo's success story, up to a point. "Militarily, I would say NATO has been strengthened, @AndersFoghR told @dcexaminer. "NATO, at the same time, has been politically weakened" https://t.co/ORqJFLx43I

These questions loom as U.S./China/Russia perceive resurgent Great Power rivalry. “space people don't always want to understand: that we cooperate in space after we've decided it's in our interest to do so from the ground," Pace said. https://t.co/0p7OzZh4y7
U.S. diplomats aren't ready to offer their own ideas. And the process is slowed by distrust. A recent discussion on peaceful practices went sideways because to was “challenging to find out what the Russians really wanted," a @StateDept official told me. https://t.co/0p7OzZh4y7 https://t.co/HLEwjezqZw
Arms control talks haven't helped. China/Russia propose treaties that wouldn't ban their anti-satellite weapons. And the sides can't even agree on what counts as a weapon. “A robotic arm can be for repair-and-servicing or it . . . can try to hurt you,” Pace said
"Space stalkers" might be the biggest concern -- satellites positioned near U.S. satellites that could be used as a weapon in a conflict to cripple the U.S. military. If unchecked, they could deter U.S. from defending an ally without firing a shot https://t.co/0p7OzZh4y7 https://t.co/tnoO5OGsvd
In the meantime, lots of concern about satellite threats. China and Russia have developed weapons that could knock out U.S. GPS. “Our adversaries are weaponizing space whether we like it or not,” @SenTedCruz said. https://t.co/0p7OzZh4y7
Speaking of fuel/power: China wants to build a space-based solar power station that can convert the sun's rays into electricity and transmit it “via microwaves or lasers” back to Earth (don't ask me how). It'd be a very big deal if they pull it off. https://t.co/0p7OzZh4y7 https://t.co/tpEjTDRydt
More importantly, there's water in space. And, apparently, water “is easily converted into rocket fuel" (Goldman Sachs), so it could power trips to Mars. "You're going to end up with the moon being a type of gas station” -- @SecretaryRoss. https://t.co/0p7OzZh4y7
The 'Second Space Age' brings commercial opportunities, too. Like Asteroid-mining for platinum. (Christmas, 2040: A double-heart charm pendant for "a love called down from the stars" -- Kay Jewelers, probably. And at a new low price!) https://t.co/0p7OzZh4y7
Why does it matter if China has that edge? “To fly humans in space...you have to master every field of technical endeavor," Pace said. "In a literally-alien environment, you learn things that you would not learn if you simply stayed at home.” https://t.co/0p7OzZh4y7
China is 'going to be the only country that has an orbiting, habitable facility' a senior administration official predicts -- unintended consequence of retiring the Space Station without a clear successor in place, which is what @SenTedCruz wants to avoid. https://t.co/0p7OzZh4y7
The @Space_Station was a high-point of post-Cold War cooperation, but it's aging. NASA planning it's retirement. But some on the Hill and even in administration, think that'd be a gift to China. “That would be a serious mistake,” @SenTedCruz said https://t.co/0p7OzZh4y7 https://t.co/0UqOmpjOzR
There's more human activity in space than ever. That means there's a lot of opportunity, but also potential danger. “Space shows a hopeful future; it shows us what's possible and what we could do together, but space is not the driver,” Space Council's Scott Pace says.

Not McCain. It wasn't "Mr. Smith Goes to Washington" with him, but at least he wasn't terrified of a bad news cycle. Even when he was wrong, he was a real senator.  https://t.co/XBhNq9Vgff
Politicians tend to be a weird kind of specialist; they're experts in whatever controversy is under way in a given week and the instructions they’ve received for surviving it. Most of them lack the self-confidence to do anything else. https://t.co/XBhNq9Vgff
Too many members of Congress take their cues from the White House; party allies put the most supportive spin possible on whatever the president does, while the opposition flogs petty controversies in a bipartisan agreement to avoid any heavy lifting. https://t.co/XBhNq9Vgff
Back when it was more comfortable for lawmakers to pretend that Russia wasn't a threat, that China wasn't a long-term rival, that various North Korea nuclear deals would work, McCain wasn't afraid to be the buzzkill.    https://t.co/XBhNq9Vgff
And McCain was one of the few federally elected officials to respect the office that he held — with its power and responsibility — and, also, to respect himself enough to believe that he could perform those duties, even when it was difficult. https://t.co/XBhNq9Vgff
Still can't get over that McCain succeeded Goldwater, entering the Senate in 1987. His first SCOTUS vote was for Robert Bork. His last was Gorsuch. So he was a player in the Supreme Court wars and in every major foreign policy debate from the end of the Cold War to now

He was such a humble man, too. He's giving a public lecture @Hillsdale, right? He ended it by calling on an attendee known locally for reciting Robert Frost poems. So his big night ended in deference to, as Eliot put it, a greater craftsman, performed by another. Mills was great.
Do yourself a favor and read Mills' "The Dowser's Ear." https://t.co/gyBMMeF68k Then, because he'd hate the idea of people reading his stuff online, go buy a copy of his Selected Poems, edited by his wife, dedicated to their family. https://t.co/8z8kkLVXcQ #WorldPoetryDay
You might expect a visiting poet type to be supercilious. Not Mills. A student was struck that he "really just wanted to teach us to write a sonnet."  He died months later, age 41, "after short, courageous battle with cancer," as the obit said. But he could flat-out write.
I don't normally do trendy hashtag things, but #WorldPoetryDay is a fine excuse to talk about the late Wilmer Mills. He visited @Hillsdale awhile back for a lecture &amp; poetry class. He was an earnest man, with good things to say, and better things to do for people whom he loved.
