To summarize, #medtwitter, us patients that have to deal with the most serious of diagnoses don’t mind if you feel the weight of it with us. That’s what makes us feel that you’re investing all you can into our case. Please cry with us if you feel like you want to.
@HealthCoachJaye @yashar I’ll work on it!
@yashar At least I can say with certainty that it wasn’t the Sayville Carvel. The Lohan’s aren’t from our parts.
@NUCLEARnicole You’ve got some healthcare heavy hitters mentioned in this thread, @NUCLEARnicole, I hope we can get you some answers!
Also, I don’t have Siri enabled on my phone. You will never find an Amazon/Google/Facebook listening device in my home. They scare the crap out of me.
I’ve said this before but want to revisit. I’ve had verbal conversations with my oncologist about recovery from surgery &amp; what it would entail. Hours later, I had ads for wound care pop up. It’s messed up. My private convos with my medical team should not be used for ad targeting https://t.co/n82Zg6ay5Z
I’ve had one doctor that had tears in his eyes while talking to me in clinic. I will remember that experience—and appreciate that doctor— till the day I die. He made me feel like a human, not a case. https://t.co/tVCDWbd287
@runawaygirl248 Still do. The other day I broke down because I couldn’t get myself up and going. I was in a fog. The only way I know how to deal with it is to just lean into it for the day because trying to fight it makes me feel worse about it. Tomorrow is always another day.
@Lifeiskitsch @CrazyCancerLady I’m sure they are proud of you for being able to accept and move forward with your diagnosis, they’re probably just not there yet because it’s too hard for them to do it themselves.
@Lifeiskitsch @CrazyCancerLady No, you are not offensive or wrong. We’re never wrong for dealing with our situations the way we do. Maybe it’s their own method of self-preservation? They might not want to think or talk about your illness as much because they find it painful?
@CrazyCancerLady I get it. I had to talk to my family about discussing my health on social. I’m open about it, but I like to choose what information is shared (&amp; where. I’m more reserved with the details on Facebook than I am on Twitter). Perhaps you can tell her to just let you take the lead?
@DrJohnCav @SU2C I’ll take that!
I find it interesting that I’ve seen quite a few tweets from people upset that the Trump-Kim summit isn’t getting more coverage, when the fact of the matter is that members of the US Press Corps have been barred from attending parts of it. How can you cover what you don’t see? https://t.co/ka4feBsIDa
As a KRAS mutant (I just like saying it that way, makes me feel like I’ve got some sort of superpower), this news from NY Presbyterian re: the effect of Vitamin C on RAS/BRAF crc tumors is a promising development. Thanks to @SU2C for funding. https://t.co/M4NjHfnBrZ
We currently own five types of vinegar. I had to take advantage of the recess in the Cohen hearing to go to the store for a sixth type of vinegar. If you told me ten years ago that not only would I have that many vinegars, but that that many vinegars exist, I would have laughed.
House Dems to #Cohen : Do you believe the President of the United  States could be compromised by a foreign adversary based on his business dealings?		House GOP to Cohen: How are you going to spend your money from your future book deal?!?!?		Le sigh.
Having one of those days where nothing I’m seeing or hearing is sinking into my brain. It’s frustrating me to tears.
@juliacottier @KaetiJB_PE @AudsDisease @BCCare @CCCNHS @Tickoffcancer @Changes4living @MaggiesCentres @lockasLass @amyelle11 My legs and feet are constantly freezing
Me spending a good chunk of my morning going back through press for A Star is Born to analyze the body language between Lady Gaga and Bradley Cooper. #oscars https://t.co/2KMBs9MFpm
Dearest @jbutt42, I think you can agree that my domination of Game of Thrones Risk tonight is evidence that a woman should be President. We’re patient and strategic while the boys are all “attack, attack, attack”. Sometimes you just gotta build those armies and fortify the ports.
@chick_in_kiev Playing a board game with friends. Honestly didn’t even know what time it was until we sat down.
The pushback that cancer patients have towards the whole “battle/warrior/survivor” terminology is that it seems to put us above everyone else. It’s dangerous to think that people that get it are “built for it” in a way that others aren’t. Spoiler: we’re not.
@realslimsheyla I thought it was something that happened to other people. Both of my grandmothers died from it, my wise older cousin died from it. In my mind, it happened to people far more important than I. I’m just a normal person! I’m no stronger than anyone else.
But this is my subject matter because I was a girl searching for answers at one point. I didn’t get it, and felt like I instantly became part of some club that I didn’t really belong to. Yet here I am, 5 years later. Cancer is a life changing thing.
Here’s the thing, guys. I’m not going to talk about cancer as if I’m “inspirational” or a “hero”. I’m a completely normal person that got colorectal cancer, and anyone could end up in my position. I’m not special. None of us are, and that’s the point.
Hi, cancer friends, here’s something you should know. The floral arrangements from #MeghanMarkle’s baby shower in NYC were donated to a number of organizations, including my favorite, @hopelodgenyc. https://t.co/Oc5apbmL9J
@DrAndrewAlbert In my family alone it was myself and my grandmother (yet mine was not hereditary). I have 4 friends that were diagnosed at or under the age of 30. I’ve had a serious uptick in private messages asking about my symptoms. Keep asking &amp; go get screened, everyone 👍🏻👍🏻
@DrAndrewAlbert Diagnosed stage III at age 31. Two local recurrences, surgery, radiation and chemo...the whole nine.
@frankie_kat Agree. I have to bring my own face mask when I go because just the smell of the one they take out of the little package of port supplies makes me nauseous. That and the taste of saline in your mouth when they do it. Yuck.
@CancerToSurvive @Tickoffcancer Thank you for following! I’ve learned so much from so many here. Twitter can be a great resource!
I’m sorry, but I can’t help feeling weird everytime I say I’m “getting my port flushed”. It just sounds like a euphemism for something dirty/gross. Someone please tell me I’m not the only one.
@realslimsheyla @mcwreads Agreed. I’m happy to be at a teaching hospital. Gather ‘round, everyone...
@realslimsheyla @mcwreads Ha, I do the same thing. Also, because of the type of the cancer that I have, most of the time I’m in a compromising position while they’re doing their thing. I like to crack some jokes to make sure they know I’m cool with them being there.
@kirstahoffman @mcwreads As a patient w/a difficult case, when my surgeon said he discussed it in conference, I felt both odd that strangers were talking about me as a Jane Doe &amp; relieved more people were going to weigh in. Overall, it’s good for all of us—those learning &amp; the patients that come after me
@NUCLEARnicole My spikes are juuuust starting to lay down.
@ThanksCancer @realslimsheyla #chemotip When you decide to shave your head, wear a wig to the next infusion. Rip it off when the nurse isn’t looking and say, “Wow! This stuff works fast!”
@realslimsheyla @ThanksCancer #chemotip Wear a thin cotton shirt &amp; when they give you the steroids, jump up from the chair and rip it off Hulk Hogan-style while ROARing.
#chemotip: Try to avoid using your favorite shampoo/soap/deodorants during chemo. As soon as you’re done, the scent of them will make you 🤢. I’ve lost many a favorite brand because of it...
@EileenBarbour1 I haven’t, but will 👍🏻. Right now I just started taking biotin. Don’t know how well it will work, but figured it’s worth a shot...
In other hair development news, I’ve developed a new look that can only be described as the Elf Mullet. I cannot stress enough how unattractive it really is.
@realslimsheyla I had zero luck even getting a human today. After jumping through all of the hoops of the automated system all I got was “we’re sorry, there are no available representatives at this time. Please try again later”....click.
@ThanksCancer @TommyVsCancer I find putting some Barry White on for your white blood cells gets them going.
@tvdinnerr You may think you’re at a disadvantage, but from where I stand, it all just makes you that much more of a badass.
You guys...I just discovered a knot in my hair. It’s been so long since I’ve had a knot in my hair because I haven’t had much hair to knot up. This is exciting!
@tvdinnerr I give you so much credit. When I went back to work after my surgery and treatment the first time, I just stared blankly at my computer thinking, “uhhhhhhhh...what do I do with this thing?” Still some days my brain clicks and other days it’s just mush.
Truth. Unless you work for an extremely understanding company, can work remotely or have flexible work hours, it’s really difficult to work full time and manage your illness/disability. https://t.co/xPEUkrfKM9
@dog_rates For your consideration. https://t.co/JPwCElXjb7
Someone on TV just started singing Baby Shark and now my day is ruined. I don’t even have a child and that song is stuck in my head constantly.
@TweetToHilde I feel like those of us that aren’t waiting for something better have freedom. How many times do you stop and think about the “good old days”? Never really know how good they are while we’re in them anyway. It makes me stop and consider the good in every day, even the bad ones.
@GavinLatz Oh I love talking with them. It makes me miss my own grandparents even more. But what’s funny is that since I’m a bit of a veteran in the cancer sense, there can be a role reversal as well. I find myself answering a lot of their questions in addition to them answering mine.
@GavinLatz Hahaha, I had to google how to spell septuagenarian.
@GavinLatz That’s crazy! I’m so sorry you’ve had to endure so much in such a short amount of time &amp; I hope you’re both doing well. I always felt somewhat special being the youngest patient in the gastro oncology waiting room. For awhile it was just me and my septuagenarian friends.
@realslimsheyla @GavinLatz My fiancé was told that he has abnormally large pupils, which also unfortunately leads to people thinking he’s stoned all the time, haha. His parents even sat him down for a talk as a teen because they thought he was on drugs.
@GavinLatz P.S. when I picture hairy cell leukemia, this is what pops into my head. https://t.co/9THlB0dGRl
I can tell you that if I were that researcher, I probably would’ve gone with furry cell leukemia. It just sounds cuter @GavinLatz. What say you, #cancertwitter, #medtwitter? Any other funny diagnoses out there that might brighten Gavin’s day? https://t.co/h4NmWKFAWz
@pier1 @pier1 I’d like to know your secrets for balancing a multitude of scents in a delightful way.
@DoctorOstomy @bhx_official This is an awesome idea
@tvdinnerr Nothing wrong with that. Salty is my middle name.
Ha! https://t.co/KwumFmuBT5
TFW you try to be romantic and light all the candles for Valentine’s Day, but all you have is scented ones so your home smells like a Pier 1 on steroids. Who knew “First Frost” would clash with “Pink Sand” &amp; “Sugar Cookie” so violently...🤢
@piccatarata That’s what was happening for awhile, but we live in an apartment with very little storage space, and her folding method easily gets us a free drawer. That’s prime real estate. He’s just not going to do it right!
One part of the #KonMari method that Marie Kondo has to address is how to not lose your sh*t when you spend all your time folding your significant other’s underwear only to have him open the drawer and rip it all apart.
@Lifeiskitsch I was in the waiting room at Sloan and a woman was there with a patient. She was on her phone loudly complaining that her kitchen remodel was making her so stressed out. If looks could kill...
@MIShouldTalk Yes, they’re also super itchy and hot!
@TheNewGenou I was under an epidural and I refused to be wheeled into the OR until my fiancé sang “Hero” by Enrique Iglesias to me.
@laurenhindman Hahaha uh oh!! I hope I don’t blow up his spot!
[UPDATE] Fun Fact: We found out later that the hot fellow was known for being a researcher by day...&amp; tater tot eating champion of the Midwest by night.
Went down to the coffee shop to get out. I just looked down and realized that I’m wearing a long tan cardigan w/knit cap, plaid scarf around my neck &amp; a pair of Doc Martens. Oh, and I carried my laptop here in a tote bag from The Strand. I am every writing cliche &amp; I hate myself.
*Whoops, misnumbered. Sorry, there’s no #5 🤷🏼‍♀️
Finally, the model opens the door and peeks his head in to tell me that the oncologist said no exam was needed and to have a good day. I don’t think I ever exhaled so hard in my life. /END
As I sat waiting for the most embarrassing moment of my life to commence, I was being peppered with texts from my friend, letting me know that they had a Barry White CD out there if I wanted him to bring it in. /7
My friend instantly bursts out laughing. He had tears rolling down his face as he says, “at least you’ll be felt up by a J.Crew model before 11am...”, before he goes out to take his spot in the waiting room. /6
Slowly, he gets up and hands me a robe, saying he’ll be back in for the “digital exam” once I’ve changed, and walks out the door. My mouth drops open as I realized that this gorgeous human was going to have to go where no man has gone before. /4
He introduces himself as a Fellow and starts the line of questioning. Somehow I made it through describing my bowel habits without turning bright red, and thought, “phew! That’s over...”. /3
We were brought into the exam room to wait, and the door creaks open. In walks in what can only be described as a male model in a white coat. I reacted as any heterosexual woman would, instantly sitting up straighter and smiling at the beautiful man in front of me. /2
A friend came with me to one of my first appointments after being diagnosed with colorectal cancer. I knew I was likely going to have an embarrassing exam ahead of me, and had been joking about it with him all day. /1
[THREAD] #cancertwitter: Do you have any funny cancer stories? I know it’s a serious subject, but there are times when you just have to laugh too. I’ll go first.
@bengreenfield @snopes Let me tell you a story about my Uncle Johnny. Unfortunately, the only one I know is that he died of whooping cough at age 2. I’m sure my grandmother would have happily accepted him with autism (which has been widely disproven anyway) as opposed to choosing his burial plot.
@pycior Wow.
@cerami_s Absolutely not. I was stupid. It was the biggest mistake of my life.
@gabe_a_brooks @BoetChels @COLONTOWN Honestly? A little relief. My last rounds of chemo were so tough on my that I got maybe 2 days of feeling well enough to get out of bed every two weeks. A delay meant I got to stretch out the good days a little longer.
@cerami_s I had an idea as well. I was so scared to have it confirmed that I just kept putting it off so I could still live naively cancer-free a little while longer.
@localdad1 Well that’s one way to do it!
@SuzieDoll912 Intensely awkward.
@COLONTOWN @DrJohnCav Done.
@sallyacb275 I have a friend with Lynch that has had some success with new treatment options. Happy to chat if he needs. There are some fantastic organizations that have already been suggested here too, this is an extremely supportive community!
@sallyacb275 I was diagnosed stage III at age 31 &amp; have had radiation, two different chemo treatment plans &amp; surgeries. My DMs are always open to anyone with questions. Wishing him strength.
@CancerLaughs @ThanksCancer I did that once. It’s not recommended when you’ve got the cancer.
@simonbudd167 @ThanksCancer It can definitely tighten your circle, that’s for sure. It’s interesting that it’s still such a difficult subject for so many people to navigate. I think that’s why I asked the question in the first place.
@sabbia1968 @ThanksCancer You are a strong, selfless person. I have so much respect for you.
@speechteach912 @ThanksCancer That’s really how I keep everyone up to date as well. Facebook is good for some things...
@ThanksCancer It’s really not though. I think everyone should be able to make up their own minds about how to divulge it. Sometimes it’s easier to write it out than verbalize it, and I get that.
@ThanksCancer I make jokes about it all the time and get such weird reactions. I’m the one with cancer, guys, I’m allowed to laugh about it if I want...
@realslimsheyla I’m so glad I’m not the only one!
Screw those flowery “LOVE” stamps, everyone getting an invitation to my wedding is going to be blessed with the joy of pups. Good boys (and girls) for all! https://t.co/fUZFgy8Bgy
@realDonaldTrump “I was elected to protect our Constitution &amp; rule of law. I fully support any investigation into myself, my organization &amp; my campaign, as I am confident that we have always operated w/ honesty &amp; integrity. Therefore, I have nothing to hide.” is what I want our president to say..
@TheCork03 Although I gotta say, that slicked back hair is not a good look.
@TheCork03 HEY LEAVE NOAH ALONE!
One of the most common DMs I get is, “what were your symptoms?”. Hopefully this helps answer the question for those too embarrassed to ask. Well done, @BowelWarrior @bowelcanceruk https://t.co/vOPVtJk21p
@morethanmySLE Go Peter!!!!
@Melissa20933771 I feel like it’s so important to hear stories like yours. I always commend those that keep it to themselves and can’t imagine how much strength it must take to do that.
I know y’all don’t follow me for my taste in music, but if you’re a musical purist—someone that likes guitars, drums and keys—you really have to get into @dawestheband. Some of the best songwriting I’ve heard in a really long time, and a hell of a live show.
@benshapiro I don’t know about you, but if all goes well with this cancer treatment stuff, I’m hoping to still be around in 50 years...or at least my kids...
@ThisPandorasBox Indeed
@GOP Increased taxes*  		*on the obscenely wealthy. There, I fixed it for you.
@Leslieks @ThanksCancer @denniskeim I take every opportunity to explain that cancer isn’t black or white—sick or cured—there’s a whole lot of grey area that you live in. I think it’s one of the biggest misconceptions that adds to heartache when you end up with the disease. You think that one day it’ll just be gone.
@bye_bye_booby I can’t even imagine.
@NUCLEARnicole That must have been horrible, I’m sorry.
@lipidguy Absolutely. I’ve had the whole range of emotions.
When I told my boyfriend (now fiancé), I blurted out, “I have cancer.....surpriiiiise” complete with jazz hands. I’m not even kidding. I’m the most awkward person in the world in serious situations.
It was so awkward for me. I think I’m the only person that ended up having an “I have cancer” party. I didn’t want to tell those closest to me on the phone, so I asked them all to come over. My mom went out and bought snacks &amp; beer.
While we’re on the topic, Cancer Twitter: how did you tell people you had cancer? #WorldCancerDay
Just want to reinforce that however you feel and react to having cancer is the right way. You can joke about it, you can cry about it, you can punch a damn wall. And no, you don’t have to “be positive” 100% of the time. #WorldCancerDay
I’m still not 100% comfortable going out in public without something on my head. I’m thinking of creating a T-shirt to wear during the awkward growing out phase that says, “I didn’t choose this hairstyle, guys, I swear...”.
My surgeon just told me that he’s seen 7 cases in which tumors had a complete response to Irinotecan &amp; that mine might be one of them. I’ve learned not to count my eggs before they hatch, but that was shocking to hear. I feel like I’m getting a future back. TY @sloan_kettering
@hr_walsh Agreed.
@VerizonSupport Oooo Verizon is bringing the heat!
@Ask_Spectrum I mean, you really could win me over, I’m a sucker for a deal. And I still have soup and fried things.
@Ask_Spectrum We’ve moved on, guys. Verizon’s been in our building and have been campaigning for us for awhile. We’ve been hold outs because I appreciate your Twitter response. This is a tough one to get over though...
@Ask_Spectrum we had to abandon ship and go to the @CBS app. You guys could’ve had fried foods too.
Alright @Ask_Spectrum, we’ve got 5 soups going for a soup-er bowl party and we’re streaming the game because our package deal was for a Roku instead of a cable box. If you can fix the really crappy streaming speed, you can come over for some soup.
@caron_1_1 Oh Caron, I’m so sorry. This breaks my heart to hear. Please know that you’re loved. Xx
@4QCancer Love!
@PressUnleashed That face😍
As much as this platform could be a dumpster fire sometimes, I like to start my mornings on Twitter. I get to learn about economic policy, cancer research processes, American civil rights history &amp; criminal law, with a few pictures of cute dogs peppered in, all before 9am.
I really think this Nick Vitale &amp; I could be friends. https://t.co/XdqVemlAIu
I really wish my dog understood me when I explain at length that we can’t go outside because it’s too cold and it’s not good for either of us. I don’t like the idea that he thinks I’m just being mean and denying him pleasure.
@JoeBucki18 @thereal_Nam_ @VA_GOP @GOP Thank you, that’s my plan
@JoeBucki18 @thereal_Nam_ @VA_GOP @GOP For the record, I’m not arguing for or against abortion with my previous statement. I was just correcting the fallacy in your previous statement regarding the children in US custody.
@JoeBucki18 @thereal_Nam_ @VA_GOP @GOP Except the ones that died.
@celenebeann I get it. I love the smell of a Summer night, but it’s not something you can bottle up
Whoooo boy. This is a good thread. https://t.co/ZC52itDZhN
I’m sorry, but there is no purer form of love than when your significant other says, “I’ll take him” when the dog needs to go for a walk at 6am with a -14 degree windchill.
@CancerOnBoard I haven’t, but I should!
Something that I wasn't prepared for after the physical aspects of my cancer were under control was the mental destruction it would leave behind. Since it's an important day for mental health, I decided to write about it. #BellLetsTalk https://t.co/WKusfYZ0E8
I just want to walk around with a tag that says, “Ask me about my cancer!”. Then maybe I could convince more people to go for their screenings.
@Lifeiskitsch @HenryFordNeuro @Sabine_NJ @TheLizArmy @marklewismd Yeeees. I keep responding with this: https://t.co/Bp7rypPBPi
@billritter7 An important response to this: https://t.co/Bp7rypPBPi
An @AmericanCancer response to the claim that scientists in Israel have discovered a cure for cancer. While I’m always hopeful, I’m cautiously so &amp; never want anyone to disrupt their current treatment plan in the hopes of a quick fix. https://t.co/Bp7rypPBPi
@tvdinnerr I know this feeling well.
@Coaching4Cancer 100% true. I often take my fiancé. He knows that I’m notorious for underselling and is often there when I’m experiencing most of my symptoms. He reminds me of things I forget.
@HealthCoachJaye @sloan_kettering has been incredible with support. I was really hoping to join their patient to patient support program, but I have to be cancer free for a year and that just hasn’t happened for me (yet🤞🏻). I’d love to help other young CRC patients navigate this.
@queenbonsai1 Right! I thought I was just tired from chemo, and I was used to that.  I didn’t think that I was damn near death from pulmonary embolism.
This is an incredibly thoughtful campaign. Well done, @macmillancancer https://t.co/d8MDFFAPNW
@Dale23Rice 👍🏻 I actually just pinned a bunch of overnight oat recipes as I want to do oatmeal right.
@TomiLahren @KamalaHarris Oh, so nooooooow sexual relationships and affairs matter. Got it. 👌🏻 Hey, if you guys could send out periodic updates on your moral standards, that would be helpful. They change so frequently that it’s hard to keep up.
I’m ashamed to admit that it took me almost 36 years to discover instant oatmeal. We were a Cream of Wheat household growing up. I just didn’t know.

@DrJaimeFriedman I would’ve gone insane. Thank God they got it in time.
@DrJaimeFriedman That is so unbelievably frustrating.
@SusanuspsS Congratulations! I know the feeling, I got shockingly good scan results earlier this month and I was all ready to go sit in the chemo chair. Did not expect to be told I can wait another three months
@Lifeiskitsch I’m so sorry about your mom. It’s crazy what cancer does to you in general. Things that you’d never connect. And they definitely don’t tell you everything to expect.
@suzibee48 Oh I always tell them, but my problem is that my pain tolerance is definitely higher than average at this point, so I tend to undersell my symptoms. Doctors can’t really give you a proper diagnosis if you can’t accurately describe the issue.
@simonbudd167 I have a hard time distinguishing what I should go to my primary care for vs my oncologists. So much is a result of the cancer or treatment, so I tend to just unload it all on my oncologist but that’s not really her deal...
Cancer Twitter: A weird fear that I have is that I’m so used to pain &amp; feeling ill that I’m afraid I won’t recognize when something serious is up &amp; will undersell it to my docs. I had two blood clots in my lungs &amp; brushed it off as just chemo stuff. Anyone else feel this way?
Anyone else workshop their new signature before they got married? I feel like it’s an opportunity to reinvent yourself. I’m signing every contract with strong, powerful loops from now on...
@JohnRush32 @dog_rates Happy Birthday Bone!!!
@GOPChairwoman @GOP @realDonaldTrump What’s odd about this is that I personally know of dozens of people that were laid off in the first three weeks of 2019. I have a suspicion that we’re going to see a rise in unemployment in the coming months.
I think I’m going to start teaching resistance training classes. For $20 a session, I hand you a leash and tell you to walk my dog. For advanced classes, I walk ahead and just continuously release squirrels.
It’s insane to me that this isn’t already a law. https://t.co/mgCqdBrafz
@Zipper Thanks.
@Zipper Ahhh I just watched this a week ago. Brilliant. You’ve covered two out of the three subjects that I love more than anything: Dogs &amp; Bill Murray. Now if you could do something that involves Nick Offerman &amp; Megan Mullally giving relationship advice, you’ve hit the trifecta.
@mmkck20 @RepLeeZeldin If they’re on the path to citizenship, they will be a legal citizen. Why would you want to hold anyone back from being a contributing member of society?
@RepLeeZeldin Come on @RepLeeZeldin, you know this is misleading. The law allows for a non-paid commission to be formed for privately funded scholarships that will not use any taxpayer funds. It also removes barriers to financial aid &amp; loans for those that are on the path to legal citizenship.
@JRHughes27 It’s not like I’ll ever thank the guy for ending a crisis he started, but sometimes we should dial it down a notch and maybe not goad the narcissist that, like it or not, does have a lot of control over the country. As much as it hurts me to say it.
@Travelin_Matt_ Trust me, I hate it too.
Unpopular opinion: I’m not sure this #trumpcaved reaction to ending the shutdown is a good look. We can’t push for him to concede and then mock him when he does. That just feeds the flames of partisanship.
RT @sacjai: No one is outraged with our healthcare system until they actually need it and have to use it.  Then all gloves are off.  		What…
@cancerrealtalk Like*
@cancerrealtalk Sigh... if only cancer were more life the flu and you just get over it.
#NYC Tourist Tip: If you’re traveling with a significant other and stand side-by-side holding hands on the subway escalator, it’s a dead giveaway that you’re probably not from around here. #slidetotheright
You don’t say?? Good to see my old friend irinotecan made the list... https://t.co/s1ofWcKCxu
@tvdinnerr Makes it even more important to talk about it. Now you’ve joined our ranks. Let’s save some lives, girl. 🙌🏻🙌🏻
@tvdinnerr I don’t get it. Have I had a few embarrassing situations? Sure, but they’re minimal and happened mostly in the beginning (and I mean really, even “normal” people have their moments). Other than that, I notice little change in my life.
@abbydphillip At this point I’m pretty sure the President could be arrested and Sarah Sanders would still say it has nothing to do with the President.
@cgegaris1 Thank you:)
Oh HEEEEEELLLLLL NO https://t.co/3n3sVs0sbC
@cancerrealtalk Right. The “you’re ok now!” syndrome. Well, yeah, but in the back of my mind I’m wondering if that pain I feel is a pulled muscle or a new tumor &amp; how I’m going to pay all of these bills since I can’t work because I don’t know if I’ll be back in treatment in 3 months, buuut...
Warning to everyone on social media everywhere: I am feisty this week. If you post false or misleading information, expect me in your comments with receipts.
@tvdinnerr This is infuriating. I feel like a lot of the negative stories come from those who had temporary ostomies. If it’s not permanent, of course you’re not going to figure out the right ways to live with it, you can just lock yourself in your room and count down the days to reversal.
@derek_mafs Well we know that won’t happen because he cut funding for cancer research.
@Dale23Rice Purell makes my stomach turn.
@Dale23Rice I agree, the smell at my treatment center instantly makes me nauseous.
RT @MikScarlet: Dear public. #Cancer can happen to you if you're healthy. It's a genetic mistake in cell replication which can occur random…
@derek_mafs The Reproductive Health Act only allows abortions up to birth if either the mother or child will not survive childbirth.
@conservmillen Only in cases where either the mother or child are not expected to survive childbirth. I’m sure that is an excruciating decision for any woman to have to consider.
It’s driving me nuts that @senatemajldr is getting off scot free in the great #shutdown Blame Game. He knows he has the votes to override Trump’s veto and end this today but refuses to bring the bill to the floor.
Something I’ve learned about myself recently: I’m not the most organized, but I am very particular about how my towels are folded. ALWAYS in half, then in thirds, then in half again. Don’t @ me.
@Jules_Gedwards I’m all for jackets!
It’s impossible to plan your future when you have to live three months at a time.
It’s so damn cold today that I actually thought to myself in the shower, “maybe I shouldn’t shave my legs, just for the extra layer of insulation...”.
I should have learned earlier in life that just because someone is condescending, it doesn’t mean they’re right.
@BurgartBioethix Conversations with the anesthesiologists are always the most pleasant, at least what I remember of them. It’s what I say to you that worries me...
@travis_statham @drnickgreiner @marklewismd With that, I’m going to end this interaction because I have far better things to be doing with my time.
@travis_statham @drnickgreiner @marklewismd And I also hope you know that it’s hard enough to live with it &amp; second guess everything you did in your life prior to getting it, frustrated that no one can tell you why you have it. Having a stranger that knows nothing about you tell you it’s your fault is not helpful.
@travis_statham @drnickgreiner @marklewismd I also hope you don’t get cancer.
@drnickgreiner @travis_statham @marklewismd There’s a suspected link, and as a patient, I’m told to limit my consumption. According to the World Health Organization, red and processed meats are probably carcinogenic to humans. https://t.co/lP1UEe4F0u
@drnickgreiner @travis_statham @marklewismd Thank you, but if you truly know the root cause of various cancers, you should probably tell someone.
@travis_statham @marklewismd And you know what they suspect causes an increase in colorectal cancer? Red meat.
@travis_statham @marklewismd So if we go by those examples, yes, I probably caused my own cancer by eating food in general, breathing air and drinking water. Such is the curse of living in an industrialized society.
@travis_statham @marklewismd Could be a number of things. Minimal regulation of chemicals used in farming in the early to mid 20th century? Increase in industrial emissions? The release of waste into drinking water? Any number of factors could have led to the genetic mutations that develop cancer cells.

Me to the girl that played kickball w/Bill Murray &amp; didn’t realize how cool that was: You don’t deserve Bill Murray!	My fiancé’s response: But maybe they’re the ones that needed him the most.	You know what? He’s right. Life lessons from #billmurraystories on Netflix is top notch
@JuniahKhaya Hi, I have to paint my nails regularly because chemo has destroyed them. If I don’t, they look yellow and gross &amp; it’s one more thing that makes me feel horrible about myself. Sometimes physical self-care is also emotional as well.
@Coaching4Cancer @dog_rates @dog_feelings Such a sweet pup!
@simonbudd167 I attribute it to my intolerance of socially unacceptable behavior.
I’m stuck on a delayed subway with someone who insists on playing their music out loud for all to hear and I’m wondering what I did to end up in this fresh hell.
Last night I had a dream I was secretly married to Chris Pratt. When  I got news of his engagement, he told me, “well, I like her too. But you &amp; I are going to stay married...”. That’s the story of why it’s 10am &amp; I’m still pissed at Chris Pratt for trying to sister wife me.
My Bubs knows what’s up. H*ck cancer. H*ck it so hard. https://t.co/pNY6TF4zDB
There is more price transparency when I take my dog to the vet than when I’m dealing with my own medical care. That’s pretty messed up.
Also, whoever is thinking about running against Mitch McConnell should be front seat in this class.
One of the smartest things Dems could do in the lead up to 2020 is increase their accessibility &amp; reinforce the fact that they’re the party of the average American. @AOC has pulled back the curtain &amp; Tweets with authenticity, that’s why she’s successful. https://t.co/Bhwmz5zaYY
@frankie_kat WooHoo!
@SusanuspsS Rightfully so. I get pissed off too, don’t get me wrong, but being angry at something you can’t change is a waste of time &amp; energy. Best of luck to you, 🤞🏻🤞🏻that the next steps are easy on you.
I recently tried to explain how I can be positive about my situation &amp; the best I could come up with is that I can’t view it as being unlucky that I have cancer. I’m lucky I have options. If those run out? I’m lucky that I will have fair warning to make the most of my time.
@DrJohnCav I plan on reaching out to them privately first. If their response is not adequate, then I will consider calling them out publicly. I worked in PR for 12 years, so I at least want to give them that opportunity.
@stomasquad @OstomyConnect @UOAA
Anyone have any ideas what the next steps I should take are? END
I want this to be a teachable moment for security staff and/or get advice as to how I can avoid this in the future. Hell, I’d also be happy to help develop some sort of universal medical pre-check if one doesn’t already exist. 8/
Unfortunately sometimes it takes publicly calling out a brand or company on social in order to get anywhere, but I’m really trying not to do that here. I just want to prevent this from happening to someone else. 7/
I’m not trying to get anyone in trouble, I’m sure she was just doing her job, but there needs to be sensitivity training. I’m a tough girl, I don’t embarrass easily, but this brought me to tears. 6/
I’m all for security and appreciate a safe venue, but I should not have to explain my medical history to a security guard just so I can go to an event and try to live a somewhat normal existence. 5/
She then pulled me outside where I had to open each and every bag of my medical supplies so that she could inspect them. I had to explain how they worked. I have never felt so humiliated in my life. 4/
I explained that unfortunately I couldn’t check my bag because I have medical supplies in it that I have to keep with me at all times. The security guard asked what my supplies were and I was forced to explain my medical conditions and unique anatomy.  3/
I have never been embarrassed by any of it until this past weekend. I was attending an event and was stopped by security due to my tote bag. 2/
THREAD: I’ve been sitting on this a few days because I very much wanted to clear my head and think about the situation before I reacted. I’ve had stage III colorectal cancer for 4 years and have been through many sensitive situations. 1/

@ViolentKuchar @COLONTOWN 🙋🏼‍♀️also KRAS. Hoping you find good options.
Dear Drivers of Queens:	We’re all looking for spots right now (got my eye on you, green Rav4). Just know that you’re in the presence of a parking ninja. I will lie in wait until that spot opens up. If you see it, I’ll be there first. I have all day to play this game. Literally.
@jaketapper Diagnosed stage III at age 31. Please see your doctors if you’re of age or feel like something’s up. It’s trending in young adults. If you’ve been born after ‘90, you now have double the chance of colon cancer &amp; 4X the chance of rectal cancer.
@KevinJo27337408 @GOP @SenTedCruz You’re completely correct in calling me out on that response. I was wrong to respond in that manner. But what I’m saying is that he has the least amount of pull of all of the top legislators. This can’t be labeled his shutdown.
@KevinJo27337408 @GOP @SenTedCruz Also, you realize that Pelosi &amp; Schumer are in two different facets of government, don’t you? The House &amp; the Senate are different, but both have to agree before any major steps are taken. I’m not trying to be condescending, I just don’t know what people on Twitter know anymore.
@CandiceVaugha20 @GOP @SenTedCruz I’m not going to tell you that you’re wrong for what you believe in. I was a Republican for many years and still understand the main fiscal points. All I’m saying is that you’re being lied to. There’s no crisis at the border. The shutdown can be worked around.
@CandiceVaugha20 @GOP @SenTedCruz No. We don’t want to pay billions for a ridiculous wall that will do absolutely nothing.
@KevinJo27337408 @GOP @SenTedCruz There was a unanimous vote that was passed by the Senate and was vetoed by Trump. Both legislative bodies could unanimously vote on it again, which McConnell refuses to do, and send it back to the President. If he vetos, they can override. McConnell refuses to do that.
@GOP @SenTedCruz How is it his shutdown when he is the Minority Leader? Of the top legislators, he’s the one with the least control in this situation.
@DoctorOstomy https://t.co/y08yv3gKa1 has a stoma shield. It’s a belt with a hard plastic cover that creates a channel. It’s great. Also good for protection when you’re participating in active sports (I wear it snowboarding)
@TheCork03 Truth.
@Zipper I watched Marley &amp; Me alone. I was bawling so hard that my dog ran in from the other room to lick my face &amp; console me...which made me cry even harder while clutching him &amp; telling him he can never die. That movie needs a warning label.
This is a frustrating thread. We need price transparency in healthcare (I can also tell you that an MRI on one part of the body is $4,760...at least according to my bill). https://t.co/gLYkMKKCA6

@HealthCoachJaye I’m working on his book “The Will to Meaning” now. Frankl is incredible!
Nice of our new neighbors to introduce themselves. Is it too soon to invite them over for fondue and game night? https://t.co/Su1E5Kffwm
@HealthCoachJaye I bought and devoured that book after we discussed it. It has since been passed onto multiple friends going thru rough times. It should be required reading! As for the Mets, a girl can only dream.... 🙂
@HealthCoachJaye Even with cancer, I consider myself the luckiest girl in the world. He’s already nailed the “in sickness and in health” part.
@askjillian I met a guy 2 months before I was diagnosed &amp; we dated thru my first chemo cycles. I’d only see him on days when I was feeling well &amp; we wouldn’t talk about it. He was my “time off” from cancer &amp; gave me something to look forward to. I marry him in June. Life doesn’t have to stop
@Melissa20933771 Yup! That’s why you fight to the death of you get a free spot
@Melissa20933771 Parking is no joke here. It’s cutthroat.
@stales @FightCRC @ReeseFCRC
@bulldog02172 I’m so sorry to hear this. My best advice is to connect with @FightCRC and visit their site. I’ve learned so much about the disease through their resources. By becoming informed, I’ve been able to actively participate in important decisions on my care. Best of luck to you both.
@benshapiro I would welcome that type of media exposure for an essential, life-saving screening procedure that gets a bad rap even though it’s not as bad as everyone thinks. Thanks for that suggestion, @benshapiro
This is an incredible, raw piece, intersecting modern politics and cancer. It’s absolutely worth a read. Much love to @DrIbram as he joins our ranks. https://t.co/yJs6A121FX
It’s my favorite time of the week-sitting in my car for an hour and a half to avoid a street sweeping parking ticket. Thanks for this exciting opportunity, NYC DOT!
I’m still astounded that my CEA levels are at my baseline right now, thought for sure I was going to be hooked up to a chemo IV today. I have faith that my team @sloan_kettering will get me to my wedding. 🤞🏻🤞🏻
@WisewomanD @DrJohnCav @Tennesseeforme @katiecouric @JamesCarville @GYRIG @DrAndrewAlbert @DMGrayMD Honestly, it’s jokes like those that freaked me out about colonoscopies so much that I refused to go to the doctor until I had stage III colorectal cancer.

@Caraeliz24 @frankie_kat I have to limit my time on Facebook and Instagram because of all of the people having babies, buying houses, going on vacations, etc. It can bring you down when you’re stuck lying in bed day after day.
RT @ReeseFCRC: Short term health plans were supposed to be eliminated under the ACA, instead, we're starting to see them grow. Pitfalls of…
@frankie_kat It’s painful when it seems like life moves on without you. It’s one of the hardest mental aspects of it all. Sending you ❤️.
@FeedleFi I’m feeling great, actually! Although I get scan results tomorrow, so my anxiety is going into overdrive...
If ever there were a question of my baddassery, know that I just had to lie on an exam table while my surgeon took a scalpel to me w/o any numbing meds. It wasn’t bad bc I’m pretty numb from surgeries, but I still think I deserve a medal for lying still &amp; taking it like a champ.
@tvdinnerr Eww, I didn’t even know that was a thing.
@tvdinnerr I think a lot of it is mental for me too. I just equate the flavor with scans. Yuck. And yes, the raspberry is just too much sweetness. It tastes like liquid jello.
@JohnRush32 Excellent. I’d lose my mind if Bone walked into my hospital room.
@JohnRush32 Love this. Can you bring him to the adult hospitals too? Therapy dog visits are the best.
@tvdinnerr Ugh. The worst. There’s only so much raspberry flavoring one can drink.
@Dale23Rice What may seem as shortcomings to you may be exactly what endears the right person to you. I don’t view being a cancer survivor as a negative, even with all that comes with it. I think it gives you so much more perspective &amp; wisdom. The right person will find that refreshing.
@lpackard 100% true. It absolutely changes and defines relationships.
@Dale23Rice It’s definitely a make or break for a relationship. Few truly consider what it means to say “in sickness or in health”. Putting yourself out there is hard. I was in a long term relationship &amp; it was scary going back out there, but I did &amp; met my future husband on tinder.
If there’s one thing I want someone single with cancer to know, it’s that it’s still possible to find and experience love (&amp; it’s so much better). Being sick lets you cut the crap &amp; love like you’re going to lose it, which is an incredible gift. https://t.co/ZrTHDj6pRg

@celenebeann @MrsBContes @enna_iluj 🙋🏼‍♀️Also watched it, and am not ashamed.
Dear 2019: I’m not even asking for a full good year. Just give me a good 6 months to build my stamina so I can dance &amp; grow some hair for my wedding. I mean, I know you don’t have much control over that, but if you can pass word on to the cancer control center, that’d be great.

@DoctorOstomy But trust me, I was feeling the exact same way after my surgery. It’s not easy. The only way to start getting comfortable with it is to dip your toes in the water. Sometimes it’s easier being around strangers first. Once you get thru it without issues, you’ll get the hang of it.
@DoctorOstomy Don’t let it hold you back. No one ever knows unless you tell them. I shrug off anything that is telling. I’ve found that the bigger deal that I make of it, the worse it is. We’re here and healthy because of our stomas. That’s nothing to be ashamed of.

@KatoC530 @ashleydixon @jodikantor 🙋🏼‍♀️I chose my surgeon at Sloan. If you’re invested in your own care, you take the time to research who is working on you. It’s the smart thing to do.

@CancerMermaid That’s exactly it. Sometimes you want to forget you have cancer and just have a normal day. It makes it impossible when you have “cancer patient” written across your head. You can’t avoid the pity looks from complete strangers.
@WEHMRADIO If Flo’s is sponsoring, I think you have to change it to Burgers, Brews &amp; Grooves. I don’t know how they do it, but those burgers are magical. Especially at the original Blue Point location.

@maneater869 @brianschatz It’s really messed up. I’m pretty open about my health stuff, but I like to choose what is shared with the world. The fact that I have a private conversation with my doctor and it’s used to target me with ads is taking it too far.
@ViolentKuchar Sadly he’s one of a kind. The world could use more of him though
@tvdinnerr There’s just something about Nick at Nite! I don’t know why, but I love falling asleep to it. Besides, it doesn’t ask me if I’m still watching.

@Lifeiskitsch @UnclaimedAna2 1. Both gorgeous. 2. We have to start an ad campaign that’s all of us with various stages of hair &amp; weight that simply says “this is the face of cancer” so people will start to understand.
@Lifeiskitsch @UnclaimedAna2 I’ve been thru that too. My first chemo cocktail didn’t make me lose my hair. I lost weight &amp; people told me I “looked great”. I would always respond that it’s not a diet I would recommend. It’s annoying when people expect you to look sick. Esp when you feel anything but great.
@1nomore1 @suzibee48 I wish it were fake, but it’s def not. I won’t post a link to a gofundme bc that’s not why I’m here. When I was dx’d, I searched for people to help me get thru it all &amp; I want to do that for someone else. That’s why I put it all out there the way I do.
@1nomore1 @suzibee48 May I ask what you think is a scam?
@celenebeann Never old.
@LGFBCanada 👍🏻 I’m in the US
@LGFBCanada I haven’t yet! Definitely need some tips as I have a wedding coming up😬
Yes. I’ve been living with cancer for 4 years, but you couldn’t tell until I started losing my hair this past chemo cycle. Looking in the mirror and seeing a “sick person” is emotionally jarring. I swear it made me feel sicker too. It’s not “just hair”, it’s your healthy identity https://t.co/Ky6WpxNmRe
One time, someone on the subway was blasting their music on a Bluetooth speaker, so my fiancé found the device on his phone &amp; took it over, playing Mariah’s “All I Want for Christmas is You” on repeat until they turned it off. When I think about that, I’m so proud to marry him.
Last night I had a dream that I was a manager at a 7-11, and Leonardo DiCaprio came into my store and tried to seduce me into posting flyers for his upcoming talk with an environmental refugee.		I mean, I would’ve posted them anyway, Leo, I think it’s an important subject.

@cornell_jenifer It takes a little getting used to, but it’s fine. I don’t even think about mine anymore.
@tvdinnerr Had the same issue with my Facebook year in review. It was all just pictures of me attached to a chemo IV, so I reposted my engagement announcement. That’s all I need to remember about this year.
I can’t wait to be married. Mainly because I love my significant other, but also because I hate saying “fiancé”. Everytime it comes out of mouth, I feel like that obnoxious woman in the “dingo ate your baby” episode of Seinfeld.
I’m starting to think that I’m going to need hip replacement in the not so distant future thanks to pelvic radiation. I don’t know if this is actually a thing that commonly occurs after radiation, but I’m going to price out LifeAlerts just to be safe.

@KatyAmericanGal @gorskon @realDonaldTrump @GOP Thank you. There a myriad of reasons why someone is out of work and it’s honestly really difficult to get approved for benefits.

@KatyAmericanGal @gorskon @realDonaldTrump @GOP Katy, Katy, Katy. I hope you never end up in my position. Incurable cancer, a lifetime of chemo. Even if I could get out of bed and work, what employer would want me? Life isn’t black &amp; white. There are plenty of us that would love to work but can’t. Not because we’re “lazy”.
@PressUnleashed Maybe I’m being too cynical thinking it has to do with fantasy. Maybe they all got together and decided to let the underdogs carry the league for a week. Let the kicker feel the glory for once...

@edwardjgarcia3 @JamesMartinSJ As opposed to Trump who is all for the sanctity of marriage and rips innocent children away from their parents? Who wants to take away my healthcare because I got sick and am not rich? The man has no moral compass and yet he’s blindly supported. It doesn’t make sense.
@edwardjgarcia3 @JamesMartinSJ I was once a Republican, but now I’m a Democrat. I don’t want to kill children. I want them to stay with their parents that are simply trying to give them a better life. I want them to have healthcare. I want them to be supported regardless of who they love.
@edwardjgarcia3 @JamesMartinSJ For the love of God, Ed. He’s talking about the death of a 7 year old girl that was in US custody.
@Jules_Gedwards The subway isn’t much better either. Seriously considering wearing an “I’ve got cancer” pin everywhere I go.
Took a quick look at my upcoming appointment calendar and I think I’m just going to move to Sloan Kettering. I’ll sleep on an exam table and subsist on Saltine crackers from the waiting room.
It’s unacceptable that some of our elected officials don’t understand how SEO &amp; algorithms work. Tech is an essential industry &amp; can easily be weaponized. You can’t regulate it &amp; protect your constituents if you don’t even know the difference between Apple &amp; Google.
RT @AmerCancerCEO: Access to quality, affordable health care is critical for #AttackingCancer. The #OpenEnrollment deadline in state health…
This. To the outside world, I have hair (for the most part) &amp; don’t use a wheelchair, so I look fine. But when I’m on chemo, I can barely walk to my kitchen due to breathing issues. There are times when I’ve had to crawl to get a glass of water. Not all disabilities are obvious. https://t.co/ENBDJFUtdv
@TheNewGenou @sloan_kettering They definitely do. I’ve gotten acupuncture &amp; massages right in my hospital bed. It seems like everyone you encounter there has a smile, which immediately diffuses the anxiety of walking into a cancer hospital. It’s an amazing facility. But I really need a cushy butt pillow, haha
@dianelivesintx So regal!
Yes, yes, a million times yes. https://t.co/oE50W5jO1a
@MIShouldTalk @sloan_kettering Ugh the wooooorst. Hoping for good results for you🤞🏻🤞🏻
@tvdinnerr After my first surgery, I gave up and just laid myself down on one of the smaller sofas. Not being able to sit at an angle greater than 30 degrees for 6 weeks ain’t easy.
RT @somuchweirdness: Though most states have Dec 15 deadlines for #ACA enrollment, a few have later deadlines to #GetCovered:		CA - 1/15	CO…
If I may suggest, @sloan_kettering, you should make the seating options in the waiting room on the gastro surgical oncology floor a bit more cushy than the rest. Or at least offer us some pillows. We tend to be...well...more tender, so to speak, post-surgery.
@realslimsheyla And the fact that I have insulin in my fridge that I haven’t used because my chemo/steroid induced diabetes has stabilized, yet I can’t donate it to anyone else. It drives me insane that I have access to lifesaving drugs that will likely go to waste.
@Melissa20933771 I’ve definitely had the extra visit. Honestly, I hope every therapy dog handler knows how much these visits mean to patients. It’s a saving grace.
@TheNewGenou Evie needs a #heckcancer bandanna! @dog_rates @matt___nelson
@Chasing_50 Mid yawn!
@nicchallenge3 @JBolaky I know that look. https://t.co/Z9i3pvUBBX
@nicchallenge3 @JBolaky Love!
@iamknightowl @gorskon I don’t think I can handle these puppies
@JBolaky I think everyone needs another dog in their life:)
@Melissa20933771 Therapy dogs are the absolute best. I wait all week for dog day when I’m in the hospital. Xx
@JBolaky So tiny!!
@CJTrusty Uh oh!
@medic737 Always appreciated!
@crazycancergirl @TheNewGenou Same.
@StGilesEngage 😢😢
@crazycancergirl @TheNewGenou It’s so unbelievably frustrating to know that you have drugs in your possession that could save the life of someone in need and you can’t do anything about it.
@LadyJulie7 Love that hat!!
Say what you will about Twitter being a dumpster fire sometimes, but when you’re in need of dog pics this platform is a treasure.
@TheNewGenou This drives me crazy as well. I was sent an insane amount of Xeloda that I never used. Even now I have insulin in my fridge that is going unused since my chemo-induced diabetes stabilized. I wish I could give donate it all. Orgs won’t even take my extra med supplies.
@clairelpetzal @David_Cradduck Hahaha
@rescuedogdexter Never too late for pups!
@UnclaimedAna2 I can’t handle all of this.
Thank you for sharing your dogs with me, everyone! My day is looking up:) Just a reminder that @dog_rates is running a canine oncology charity drive right now if you want to pick something up for your good boys &amp; girls... https://t.co/78UKAo1dJw
@CMC41 Happy Birthday Hank!! ❤️❤️
@laurenhindman I would in a second!
@celenebeann Love me my Otis!
@maison21 Doris May &amp; Richard make my day!!! 😘😘😘
@realslimsheyla Thank you! I’ll take kitties too. Basically anything furry and/or cute.
Dear Twitter:	I’m having a really crappy morning. Please send pictures of dogs. 	Thank you.
@Zipper YAAAAAY!!! I’m so happy!!
@realslimsheyla Mine right now. https://t.co/wpVDSjmMcZ
@GavinLatz I’m so sorry your son had to go through this. I hope he’s well now.
And if you’ve stumbled upon this tweet after having just been diagnosed? Please know that I still would not trade a day of my life to avoid treatments, surgeries or the uncomfortable moments that colorectal cancer brings. Every bad day passes.
I overshare, but I’m ok w/being judged for talking about what I’ve been through. If it sticks in the back of someone’s mind &amp; convinces them to go to the doctor, it’s worth it. Had I known what #ColorectalCancer would do to me before I had it, I would’ve gone much sooner myself.
@tvdinnerr And they’re lucky to have you. Xx
@tvdinnerr That’s incredibly frustrating.
@MelissaWare7 @frankie_kat @BSBreastCancer And I like calling fluorouracil by its nickname 5 FU because I like to say it’s giving my Cancer a big FU 🙂
@MelissaWare7 @frankie_kat @BSBreastCancer My neuropathy cleared up in my hands pretty quickly, but it took about a year for my feet to bounce back. I did try acupuncture to help and it seemed to. At least I can get pedis now without jumping out of the chair, the tickling is bearable:)
@tvdinnerr Completely agree. I was lucky enough to freeze my eggs before treatment, but I still can’t carry. Being told that I’m “less of a mom” because I won’t go thru childbirth infuriates me. I’ve gone thru more pain than imaginable. I’ve earned that badge a million times over.
@billnofi @AnthonyWEHM I’m here for this crossover if it ever happens.
An interesting study, making the point that including patient advocates in med conferences boosts Twitter engagement vs. only MDs &amp; researchers. May I suggest that sometimes y’all just talk over our heads? It’s nice to have an informed patient explain in laymen’s terms. https://t.co/63fQ7La6fy
@BSBreastCancer @frankie_kat Yes! I can’t describe it to anyone else, but it’s an internal tickle!
@frankie_kat @BSBreastCancer Absolutely. Even neuropathy. I remember trying to treat myself to a pedicure a few months after chemo. It felt so weird &amp; ticklish that I couldn’t stop giggling and pulling my foot away. I had to apologize to the nail tech and tell them it wasn’t them, it was me:)
@realslimsheyla True, but as much as social media has brought out the worst in people, in some ways I feel like it does serve an educational purpose. I grew up fairly sheltered, but there are some posts that have made me open my eyes. I’m hoping that happens for some of these people.
@frankie_kat @BSBreastCancer I was just talking to a nurse about all the chemo I’ve had &amp; she was surprised I made it through all of my cycles. She said it was rare. Oddly, it made me feel like a superhero. I get that people are scared of chemo, but the alternative is so much scarier to me. Cancer is painful
@BSBreastCancer @frankie_kat Yup. Still, after all is said and done, without that stuff I wouldn’t be here. So I’ll take the occasional bout of nausea.
@BSBreastCancer @frankie_kat Yeeeees. I have this aversion too. And anti-bacterial gel. I have to hold my breath when I put it on.
@frankie_kat Yes! For this past cycle I drank sparkling water because the plain stuff just felt gross!
I didn’t want to do it to myself, but went through the comments on Gabrielle Union’s Instagram. So disgusted by some people. A father doesn’t carry a child for nine months, but you never tell him he’s not a “real dad”, what makes it different for a woman who can’t carry?
@frankie_kat Ugh. Luckily it gets better the farther out you are, but there are still just things that set you off. I still can’t drink tepid water because it’s all I could have while on oxaliplatin, so it makes me nauseous. I put so many ice cubes in my glass now it’s insane.
Some good points here. https://t.co/yPPJDFtB5c
@mathORrun @Suburban_Mom1 I second that! Always amazed by the strength and commitment of the ones around me, especially my fiancé. You may not be the one going through the treatments, but this impacts your life greatly as well. What you do for him means everything.
@lpackard As gross as it is, it did just remind me to take my Xarelto.
I can’t stop looking at that damn blood clot. I stop every time someone posts it in the feed. I’m equally disgusted and intrigued.
@PressUnleashed Oh I have the worst case of chemo brain. It’s horrible.
@tvdinnerr I carry my own face mask in when they access my port because the smell of the one they take out of the package for you makes me nauseous.
@alexisohanian Not seeing a problem here.
Just went back through my Instagram feed and saw a picture of myself attached to my chemo IV. Immediate nausea. Is chemo PTSD a thing?
This story is incredible. https://t.co/J7P1bvOE5p
Get cancer: Ok, I can do this.	Have ostomy surgery: No problem, I’ll figure it out.	Months of chemo: Don’t worry about me, guys, I can handle it.	Have to cancel my engagement shoot bc I have an infection &amp; have to go back to daily nurse visits: WHHHHHHY CANT I JUST LIVE MY LIFE?!
@scastano https://t.co/tuleSnzZ29
@lpackard Waiting on scan results is absolute torture and I’ve cried in the parking lot myself. I couldn’t be happier for you!!
@lpackard I wish I could like this more!
@DGlaucomflecken One of my doctors said it to me once &amp; I immediately liked him more. He gets it, this is a very fucked up medical situation I’ve found myself in.
This is legit, but I would never say it’s anyone’s fault. I’ve had friends tell me that they just didn’t want to bother me by telling me about their problems, or just figured I’d be too sick to invite to an event. They didn’t realize that they were inadvertently alienating me. https://t.co/LxvM4cyXhB
@marklewismd I had to block myself from doing it. My sister has advanced degrees in biology and had access to peer reviewed medical journals. I asked her to filter through and tell me what she would do in my place. I didn’t want to go in blind &amp; I trust her more informed judgement.
I think I’ve watched 8 straight hours of Holiday Baking Challenge on @FoodNetwork today. I think it’s time to admit I have a problem.
The fact that it’s 2am and I’m now awake because of hiccups is the biggest b.s.
@realslimsheyla @Tinder This is adorable.
@realslimsheyla Seriously. Who would have guessed that a swipe right on @tinder would result in marriages and saved lives.
@realslimsheyla Wow. I also discovered my cancer after a really good Tinder date turned into something. It’s funny how the prospect of love will push you to start taking care of yourself. I had been putting off the doctor for over a year before I had that fateful Tinder date. He saved my life.
@lpackard @realslimsheyla Also decided to forego chemo and treat holistically. Don’t get me started on that one. To each his own though, I guess.
@realslimsheyla Ugh. I read the corresponding article on People and almost lost it.
We live in loungewear now. https://t.co/jdQqc7jEIj
@TheNewGenou Although he replaces WV with Jamaica, so that might not be what you’re looking for
@TheNewGenou If reggae is of any interest, try Toots and the Maytals
@cancerrealtalk I’ve been building myself little pillow piles in bed and go in there with him until he falls asleep or it starts bothering me. Then it’s back to the couch.
@cure_magazine A5: I had just started dating my fiancé when I was diagnosed. I told him I needed him to be my “time off” from cancer. I saw him when I was feeling well, we didn’t talk about it &amp; he treated me normally. It took pressure off of both of us &amp; gave me a break from cancer world.
@KayFellowz I can tell you a little bit about what I go through when my white blood cell count dips too low and I have to get a shot of Neulasta that makes me feel like electric shockwaves are shooting through my skeleton all so that I can go out in public to get to my doctor’s appointment.
I can’t, for the life of me, figure out how I have gotten a cold when I can count on one hand the amount of times I’ve left my apartment in the last month.
I haven’t been able to sleep in bed since I had surgery a month ago. Last night I found myself tearing up while trying to fall asleep on the couch. The reason? I miss sleeping next to my fiancé. It hit me that I’m pretty lucky to love someone so much that I miss their snoring.

@ViolentKuchar 31, stage III. :(
When I was first diagnosed with colorectal cancer, I was the only person under 45 in the waiting room at the gastro oncologist. Today, I see 4 of us. This is a trend I’m not happy to be a part of. Get checked if you think something’s up.

@TheCork03 @dog_feelings I need these.

@frankie_kat CONGRATS!!
@TristanPEJ I wish I had the luxury of looking that pissed off about making $230,000 a year.
Also thankful for a fiancé that gets up in the middle of the night to sleep on the couch with me because our bed is too hard for me in my current state. I’m a lucky girl.
Thankful that my doctor approved taking a day off from the visiting nurse so I can spend the holiday with the people I love. It’s the little things that end up meaning so much.
@The_B_Movement @ElizAthertonSop @campaignkate @bowelcancerman @GemSavory @bowelcanceruk Constant rinsing with Biotene (or any mouthwash that doesn’t have any alcohol), and rinsing with a saltwater solution has helped. As for the appetite, honestly medical marijuana is the only thing I’ve found that actually makes me want to eat.
@hr_walsh Haha, I love you
@TheNewGenou I’m so sorry.
@MIShouldTalk @Zipper It just gets better.
I’m not young, but I’m not old either. I respect my elders, but something to consider: the world is vastly different than it used to be. The internet has been weaponized. It might be time to admit the younger generation is better equipped to deal with this than you think.
@Harryslaststand We love you, Harry.

@Zipper My new honeymoon plan is to fly to Italy to have dinner at Ristorante Mella and hang out with Ice. I need to smoosh that pup.
@Zipper @MIShouldTalk Phew! It definitely touches on difficult subjects, but in a deep and uplifting way. It’s a perfect balance, really. It humanizes situations that we feel detached from here in the U.S., like the Syrian crisis. Thank you for the happy endings, though. We all need them.
@frankie_kat Are you hearing this, @netflix? We’re ALWAYS still watching
@frankie_kat I wish there were a way to disable that.
@CancrPatientPOV I’ve been considering giving that a try! I’m obsessed with watching baking videos online, seems right up my alley
@MIShouldTalk I agree. I’m inundated with cancer enough, I don’t want to watch another movie or show about it. Luckily Dogs doesn’t have any sad cancer storyline (that I know of yet, I’m only on episode 3. Could you confirm @Zipper??), just very good pups:)
@maneater869 You do. It’s amazing.
Confession: I’ve been rationing episodes of #DogsOnNetflix so that I have something to make me happy on days when the whole cancer thing is starting to get to me. Looks like today is the day for episodes 3 &amp; 4. It’s a successful coping mechanism.
Keep talking &amp; laughing about how @Ocasio2018 doesn’t have $100K in her bank account, @GOP. It just widens the already enormous gap between you and the majority of Americans.
@UnclaimedAna2 I hate it too. I go to Sloan Kettering and there are offices all over Manhattan with shuttles in between. Each office is always packed. It’s horrible that there are so many of us.
@tvdinnerr Same. I go through these intervals of sleeping for about 20-40 minutes at a time. I honestly can’t remember the last time I slept for a few hours in a row.
Today two of my oncologists apologized for keeping me waiting. I never get mad at a long wait because:	1. I know they’re running late due to the fact that they’re taking the time needed w/each patient. I respect that. 	2. It’s not like I have anything more important to do.

@Zipper @netflix Thank you! I can’t wait to watch it

@lpackard @alisonbyway @campaignkate THC/CBD has been a savior all around. So thankful I live in a state where it’s medically legal.
@alisonbyway @campaignkate I have to say, acupuncture did help me with neuropathy. I’m not one to normally buy into that, but it was offered to me by my cancer center and figured I’d give it a shot.
@tvdinnerr Completely and totally understand. Xx
@tvdinnerr I think it was about the same amt of time after surgery that my bf drove me out to my favorite spots in Montauk. Once I was somewhere familiar, I had this feeling that everything was going to be OK. Not as much changed as I thought it would. Still the same person:) Sending you ❤️

@Turn_and_Tempo Thank you for the kind words (for the record, I’m registered Dem, but used to be GOP). I appreciate anyone that responds clearly with facts to back up their argument &amp; without name calling. I believe that civility needs to return to our interactions &amp; try my best to live by that.
@tvdinnerr Totally been there, only mine was a Banana Republic.
@Turn_and_Tempo @maison21 @ASlavitt @alexespind And I think a big part of that would be government intervention in the overall cost of care. We need transparent pricing &amp; accountability in the pharmaceutical industry.
@Turn_and_Tempo @maison21 @ASlavitt @alexespind I unfortunately can’t work anymore, but I had been working since age 14. There has to be a happy medium between socialized healthcare &amp; a completely free market. I don’t want the government making decisions on my care, but I do want to be able to afford it.
@Turn_and_Tempo @maison21 @ASlavitt @alexespind *write each other off. Hate that I can’t edit.
@Turn_and_Tempo @maison21 @ASlavitt @alexespind Thank you. I appreciate debate and differing opinions and try to seek out all sides of an argument. It’s important to understand and not each write off. I feel it’s the only way we can move forward as a country and get anything accomplished.
@Turn_and_Tempo @maison21 @ASlavitt @alexespind We need the protections that the ACA offers us. Had it been given time before the GOP immediately started to dismantle it, the costs would have eventually started to stabilize. The individual mandate helped to offset the cost of high risk patients like myself.
@Turn_and_Tempo @maison21 @ASlavitt @alexespind I’m not asking for government run healthcare, I know that has its issues as well. I just wish the ACA was given time to stabilize with the individual mandate in place. And I wish our government would take action on the cost of pharmaceuticals. That is a huge part of the issue.
@lpackard @DeanHeller I can’t love this enough. You were the first person I thought of when I found out he lost. That’s a great win that @mlereese would be proud of.
So far this week I’ve voted and gotten a flu shot. I feel so damn socially responsible.
@tvdinnerr @ReeseFCRC @ASCO @FightCRC Would love to hear the “science” behind that.
@tvdinnerr @ReeseFCRC @ASCO @FightCRC Frozen lemons is a new one! Although I will say that acupuncture helped with my neuropathy after chemo, so it has some benefits. Definitely didn’t cure my cancer though, that’s for damn sure.
@Turn_and_Tempo @maison21 @ASlavitt @alexespind Everyone’s experience matters to me. But have you thought about what would happen if the ACA was repealed and, Godforbid, your cancer returned? Insurance companies could turn around and say, “sorry, you’ve hit your lifetime cap. You’re on your own now”.
@Turn_and_Tempo @maison21 @ASlavitt @alexespind That’s difficult to see since they tried to repeal the ACA and strip us of our protections without offering up a viable replacement and are still trying to deem it unconstitutional by fighting it in Texas courts.
@ReeseFCRC @ASCO @FightCRC Ugh. If turmeric cured cancer, my life would be a hell of a lot easier. Sadly, it does not, but that doesn’t stop people from endlessly telling me to try it.

@chrisbruno67 @lpackard @JessicaValenti I didn’t have cancer. Then I got cancer. Before, if I lost my coverage and needed new coverage, I didn’t have a pre-existing condition. Now, if I lost my coverage, I have a pre-existing condition. Soooo, yeah. You can develop a pre-existing condition.
@MattWalshBlog I derive my wellbeing from healthcare. So I’d say that 100% of my life is dependent on what happens in Washington.

@frankie_kat The last few treatments are definitely the worst. My first go round with chemo I was thisclose to throwing in the towel at round 6 of 8. The end seems so close but yet so far. The good thing is that you bounce back pretty quickly once it’s all over. Hang in there!

Anyone else had crazy joint pain after FOLFIRI? It wasn’t listed as a side effect, but my knees &amp; shoulders are horrendous. My left shoulder is so bad that I have to physically lift my left arm with my right. At this point I just add it to the list, but not sure what to do.

Filling out paperwork that requires a list of all of the dates that I’ve seen each of my docs, stayed in a hospital, been to an ER, had a scan/blood test makes me want to rip out every hair I have left on my head. I’ve got three patient portals open in three different screens.
@TheCork03 Thank you, and same here, hope you’re feeling better!
@TheCork03 Parks and Rec has gotten me through some tough times. I’m doing ok, sore, but ok. Are you still in the hospital?
@dofo11 @DocBastard And as a patient, my right is to not have my life put at risk because you have the luxury of choosing whether or not you get a shot. I should also have the right to refuse treatment from medical professionals that don’t get vaccinated. 🤷🏼‍♀️
@TheCork03 Ahhh, I’m dealing with shit being cut out by my tailbone too right now. Twinsies.
@TheCork03 Are you ok??
@tvdinnerr @mlereese Thank you!! I’m just paying it forward, I had some amazing patients help me along the way
@ESaidenberg Same!! Even the sensitive skin adhesives don’t work for me. I go to town once they disconnect me. It’s such a relief.
Is there anything worse than having an itch that you can’t scratch?
@cancerhusband1 @BSBreastCancer I used Aquaphor and it worked well.
I always bristle when anyone calls me a “hero” simply because I have cancer. No, @mlereese is a hero. Anyone that can face the inevitable with their head held high is a hero. We love you, Emily. https://t.co/r37636K2AW
@celenebeann He knows his marching orders. Cheeseburger. It’s always a cheeseburger.
Some days I can go without eating until 6pm and not even notice it. But when I have to stop eating at midnight the night before surgery and I don’t have to be there until 1pm... https://t.co/R2fdcv7Ox8

If you’ve ever wondered what a tumor felt like, I can tell you that they’re incredibly annoying. So much so that I’m going to be whistling and skipping my way into the OR next week.
I know @JamesConner_ doesn’t want to let the fact that he’s been a cancer patient define him &amp; I completely understand that. But as someone going through treatment, watching the playback of him practicing while undergoing chemo is incredible.
@espn @JamesConner_ I love the hell out of this.

@alexghrz @BetoORourke @FightCRC As if I couldn’t love Beto enough.
Apparently fighting for your healthcare makes you a “Democrat political operative”. Before I got cancer, I was registered GOP. Funny how a serious health issue makes you realize exactly who’s on your side. Guess that makes me a political operative too. Vote @RosenforNevada. https://t.co/DNgKYuEQ5O

@moustachewax I like to give tips about using the Sloan Kettering shuttles to the different offices around NYC and what parking garages have the best rates.
@tvdinnerr Ahh yes. And then you can experience the joys of sitting in a chair like a normal human again.
It’s weird being a cancer veteran in the doctor’s waiting room. You look around &amp; can pick out the new patients. Their faces are wrinkled with concern &amp; you remember being there. Everything was so foreign. Now I’m just over here chilling with my book on the sofa like I’m at home.
@tvdinnerr Thank you! Hope yours went well!!
@tvdinnerr No, thankfully it’s just a subway ride for me (although that could always turn nightmarish as well...)
@tvdinnerr Ugh. I’m on my way to Sloan as we speak.
@RepLeeZeldin Fear of losing my health insurance is kind of putting a damper on all of that.

@zoomydu I hear you.
I’ve seen some breast cancer patients denouncing #Pinktober for a few different (valid) reasons. Breast Cancer Patients/Survivors: what would you recommend that others do to support you instead of buying goods that are emblazoned in pink ribbons?
A good side effect from cancer? Driving with all the windows down on the Grand Central Parkway while belting “Africa” by Toto at the top of my lungs, and not giving one sh*t what anyone around me thinks.
@VBlush I definitely wasn’t. It was a difficult, emotional decision. I begged my doctors for other options. I was back in the hospital with C-Diff a month after my surgery. It hit me then that if I could handle a major digestive infection with a new stoma, I could do this. Now it’s easy.
@VBlush This is interesting. I wonder what would happen if you asked patients that have a permanent stoma the same question after they’ve been living with it for a year? I bet “cured of cancer” would win then. Fear of the unknown is likely what spurred these answers.
@VBlush Dare I say, I find it more convenient at times as well.
@ShadyAshamalla @azimari @SWexner @Andyf54MD @nhilsi @VBlush Wholeheartedly agree with this statement.

I can’t help but feel a little uneasy that Bob Hugin, a former pharmaceutical exec, is parading cancer patients in ads for his NJ Senate campaign. The cost of drugs are a good portion of our healthcare issues &amp; it just doesn’t sit right with me.

This is the world that I fight daily to live in, and am grateful for.
I’ve been concerned that perhaps I’m too much of an optimist because I’ve always believed in the inherent goodwill of humanity. But I’m not wrong. If there’s anything I’ve learned, it’s that people are good. I’ve been the recipient of it on multiple occasions.
Whenever you start to feel down at the state of the world, just remember that a group of people stepped up and donated over $4K to a complete stranger just because she made a silly little instagram post during a rain delay at a @mets game.
Thank you all again from the bottom of my little heart. I’m so lucky to have the support of the @barstoolsports community. Xx
If there’s anything else to say, it’s please stay on top of your health. You know if something’s up with your body. I ignored my symptoms for too long and it’s robbed me of so much. Please get screened if you’re of age, have a family history or just don’t feel right.
The words “thank you” are not quite enough, but they’re the best that the English language has for now. I can’t wait to take these donations and pay it forward to @sloan_kettering @FightCRC and a few other organizations that I’d like to spread the wealth to. It’s huge.
To @KFCBarstool @TheCork03 @Marlins_Man @mets &amp; everyone who contributed to #rallyforali: I had no idea my little post would go this far. I’m humbled &amp; speechless. I can’t believe so many people would step up for a complete stranger &amp; it has restored my faith in humanity.
@FightCRC @KFCBarstool 💪🏻💪🏻💪🏻
@Marlins_Man @Twitter @KFCBarstool @Mets @Marlins You are incredible. I don’t know how to thank you for this!

@jshjosh41 @KFCBarstool @kevin Thank you so much!
@RuFiOooooh I’m so sorry to hear that. Younger people are more likely to be diagnosed at a more advanced stage than older patients. Mainly because they don’t regularly go for screenings and the symptoms of colorectal cancer are tricky to pin down. It’s scary.
@eltiposinnombre It’s scary how many younger people I know are getting it. The new stat is that if you were born after 1990, you have double the chance of getting colon cancer &amp; 4x the chance of rectal cancer. It’s insane.
@withlovemars @KFCBarstool @Mets I hope all is well
@paqkiwi It’s crazy how it sneaks up on you, isn’t it?
@TheCork03 @Mets @KFCBarstool I can be quite salty &amp; political here. It’s my safe place to argue and advocate for my health care:)
It’s 12:15am and we’re just leaving the @Mets game. Thank you so much to @KFCBarstool for helping me raise funds and awareness. It means so much to me. I had no idea I would have colorectal cancer at 31 &amp; would be on my 2nd recurrence at 35. Please pay attention to your health.

@KFCBarstool This means more to me than anything. I’m being treated at @sloan_kettering and they’ve already saved my life more than once. Research is hugely important (plus, colorectal cancer is on the rise in young adults, so check the junk in your trunk)
@KFCBarstool @Mets OMG. Thank you so much for this (I’m Allison). The @Mets gave us an incredible gift bag. Thank you to all that have offered us a beer (we may have had 1 or 2...or 3. It’s been a long wait). If you could, please donate to @sloan_kettering or @FightCRC instead.

One good thing about having less hair on my head is that it takes far less time to dry.
@scarehomesuk You’re definitely not alone. It sneaks up on you. It took me a long time to realize that cancer wasn’t just some flu that I was going to get over and go back to normal life. “Normal” is now living in 3 month increments between scans.
I ❤️ my city. https://t.co/umtDQWItum
I remember pulling into the parking lot for my first scan after 10 months of treatment &amp; losing it when I read “cancer center” on the sign.

More to come as the days pass.
There are things that make you want to live...and it’s very rarely money.
Kindness goes a long way. The people answering the phone should be treated with the same respect as the ones calling the shots. I don’t care how many degrees you have, it means nothing if you can’t get past your own ego to make it all work.
If you’ve found love in this world— whether it’s with a member of the opposite or same sex—you are entitled to bask in it as much as humanly possible. It’s a rare, other worldly experience that I would deny no one of.
Thread: Things I’ve learned about life so far...		Don’t advocate for a party, advocate for the common good. I don’t care which side you’re on, as long as you are arguing for basic human rights and our democracy.
@alexghrz I don’t think men realize what it’s like to walk home with your keys strategically positioned between your knuckles. I’ve done it more times than I can count.
@NVermaNBCBoston @DrJohnCav This is fantastic, thank you!
There are things in life that make you want to live even when you’re faced with the toughest odds. I can tell you right now that I’m not going through this shit because I want to make more money and buy more things. It’s all for love.
@zoomydu @ThanksCancer Agreed. I would take that test a million times over if I could get back the things I’ve lost.
Dear cancer world: there are people that will love you regardless of what this disease does to you. Please know that. And the ones who won’t aren’t worth you and all of the amazing things you’ll discover about life. Feel bad for them, not yourself.
@zarabia1197 Seriously, board games are the best for it. But there are also apps that help as well if you don’t have someone to play with in person. It really helps.
@zarabia1197 I watch and play both of those too! Even if I lose, the motion of thinking about my next move works the brain muscle a bit (and if I do win, I feel even better about myself since I work with a handicap🙂)
@lpackard @VoiceHealthCare Yeeeees.

@frankie_kat Thank you!!!
Here’s your reminder to stay on top of your health. Listen to your body. If there’s something off, go to the doctor &amp; don’t take “you’re too young” for an answer. Before diagnosis, my biggest fear was a colonoscopy. Now it’s that my wedding vows will have an expiration date.
@Avidguru @AlanGedeEdwards Yes, I should totally give credit to @Jules_Gedwards as well. She’s incredible.
Honestly, it’s hard to change my thought process from feeling like I’m taking something away from his life by being sick. This helped me realize that my illness might be a benefit in some way by giving us both perspective on what truly matters.
Thank you for this, @AlanGedeEdwards. I won’t lie that I feel guilty for dragging my fiancé through all of this with me. I apologize to him all the time and he tells me to stop. Your post allows me to sort of see things from his perspective as my caregiver. https://t.co/DACKSgwgX6

@TedwardTracy I was thinking of making an “I’m not bald, but I have cancer” shirts for whenever I have to take the subway because I’m sick of the judgement if I need a seat.
@kimzim1967 I agree. There are days when I’m feeling good &amp; I wish I could just go to the office. But I can’t start tasks that I won’t be able to commit to, because I never know what any day—or hour, even—is going to bring. It’s not fair to the people that depend on me, so I had to step out.
Here’s your Monday reminder as you go about the daily grind, kids are going back to school, and life is frantic: Know that someone out there (namely, me) is jealous. Not working may seem like a dream to some, but I miss the crazy, normal days so much.
@GongGasGirl @alexghrz As a woman without children &amp; living with cancer, I sure hope my life isn’t considered meaningless in the end...

@frankie_kat Yup. I shave my legs like once every three weeks now. It’s great.
A positive of chemo? It serves as a great mosquito repellant. Everyone else is itching this morning, and I’m over here with smooth, bump-less skin. They want nothing to do with this blood.
As I said earlier this week, the decision to end treatment is the bravest one that can be made. It should never— never—be considered a sign of weakness.

@ProfJillian @DeathandCulture Sigh...that’s a bit frustrating
@VirginiaMByrne I felt the same with my grandmother’s passing. She made sure she gave us instructions. When I asked her how she could be so calm, her response was, “when God’s ready, he’ll take me”. She was so at peace w/what was transpiring. I knew then that I wanted to be like her in the end.

@alexghrz Ugh. Persistence is only cute in rom-coms...and honestly, sometimes I find it creepy then, too.
@alexghrz This was even after I made it clear I had a boyfriend and had zero interest in this guy. Seriously, men, shit like this isn’t cute. It’s creepy as hell.
@alexghrz I started doing that after one particularly creepy encounter during a business trip. A guy I had a short innocent conversation with while I was eating alone at the hotel bar actually hunted me down &amp; showed up at my work event the next day. I hid until he left.
@mattdpearce But only the best, most guilty crooks.

@mlereese That would be Breast Cancer Social Media:)
Whenever this has been brought up to me, I kindly remind them that Steve Jobs was one of the richest people in the world &amp; he died of cancer. If there were a cure, he surely would’ve been able to buy it and/or any pharmaceutical company that had it. https://t.co/gOslTlsoGj

Hi new followers! Thanks for joining me on this little cancer saga. I sure hope I don’t let you down &amp; am able to entertain and/or keep your interest.

@TedwardTracy I’m a Taco Bell AM Crunchwrap girl myself
@alexghrz Exactly. We all have to go down that path at some point and it’ll never be easy to discuss. It may sound weird, but I’d prefer to know it’s coming and be able to prepare for it by spending time with everyone I love. Your days are so much more meaningful.
@TheNewGenou Completely agree. The end goal is of course survival &amp; I’m doing everything in my power to get there. But I was also given just a 30% chance of it &amp; can’t ignore that. I’m of the mindset that there’s a way to balance reality with a measure of positivity so you’re not drowning.
@TheNewGenou She’s a character, but I applaud her confidence, haha.
@TheNewGenou My three year old niece came downstairs, spun around in her dress and said, “look, Aunt Allison, I’m beautiful”. She also told me her breath smelled good and proceeded to blow in my face for proof.
I admit that I get a little angry when I try to talk about death &amp; get shut down w/“oh let’s not go there”. Talking about the real possibility that you might die &amp; making plans for it isn’t being negative, or weak...it’s the bravest thing anyone can do.		https://t.co/rqX201slAU
@MarkstageIV What’s funny is that “Don’t Stop Believing” was one of the songs I danced to last night:)

Also, the freedom from caring what anyone thinks about my body is a wonderful thing. Thanks, cancer.
I thought that I would never be able to get over it, that I would think about it all the time &amp; it would be this cloud that hung over me. That’s not the case. Yes, you live a little differently, but my life is good...and more importantly, it saved my life.
Wow, thank you all for the support! TBH, I wrote this tweet because I almost refused the surgery. It was my last option, &amp; I searched for #ostomates on social media to prove that you can still have a life with a stoma. I’m hoping to help someone out there searching for the same.
I have an #ostomy. I am currently on a break from chemo. Tonight, I danced my butt off, threw my arms up in the air in a shirt that probably revealed my little pouch friend, and I couldn’t care less if anyone saw it. I’m alive, and I love every second of it.
@mattdpearce It’s an unfortunate reality for those of us who are of working age and fighting off cancer. My co-workers banded together to give me 5 weeks worth of their vacation time when they found my first recurrence. I had no option but to accept it because I blew through my time.
@TheNewGenou When I had my first recurrence, a group of employees at my company banded together to donate 5 full weeks of vacation to me so I could recover from surgery without concern. It was incredible.
@jbutt42 @parksandrecnbc Indeed.
@dog_rates @xBayBearx Holy crap, this is adorable.
@marklewismd Uggghhhh the IV pumps. If it wasn’t mine going off, it was my neighbors. Also, a little warning before lights are flipped on could go a long way.
Have you ever loved a show so much that you get sad when you think about the fact that the characters don’t exist in real life? 		That’s how I feel about @parksandrecnbc. I want a reboot. I need more.
@CallieaaWoW Yup. At Sloan Kettering there’s a room where you change into the gowns, put your stuff into a locked cubby and wait for your tests/treatment together. Then you go to the lab for IV/blood tests.
@kimzim1967 I agree, it’s hard to be involved with patient organizations for me. Unfortunately when you meet people in the cancer community, you have to deal with loss more often.
And I’ll be damned if cancer is going to take my good days too. Screw that.
Don’t get me wrong, the days I spend curled up on the bathroom floor are not fun, but we’re all in charge of our lives, despite it spinning out of our control sometimes. Steering into the skid is the only way to recover. I get through bad days by staying laser-focused on the good
We never know how much time we have, and I refuse to spend it dwelling on the things that have gone wrong in my life. It’s such a waste when I have so many other things that I can be grateful for and can revel in. You’re not really living if you’re giving your life over to cancer
Without fail, there’s always a Debbie Downer, which I totally get, none of this is easy. But I’m of the mindset that even if I only meet you for 20 minutes, I want those 20 minutes to better both of our lives in some way. I like sharing my story. Despite cancer, I’m happy &amp; proud
The waiting area in the locker room before you go in for radiation or scans is always an interesting place. You meet people that are all in the same club, but all deal with it differently. There are some really meaningful conversations that can occur.
@cancerrealtalk CONGRATS!!
How does one plan their wedding look when they’re not sure if they’re going to have hair...🤔
@Stella83288710 They suck you in and you just can’t stop.
@simonbudd167 It’s always interesting trying to explain it when you meet someone and they find out about your cancer. “Oh, but you’re ok now, right?” Not exactly, but I don’t really want to get into my full medical history, so I’ll just say, “yeah”.
I think one of the biggest misconceptions about cancer is that it’s black &amp; white: you either have it, or you don’t. There’s a whole spectrum of grey in between, like when you’re on indefinite chemo. No, I’m not terminal, but I’m not “cured” either. I’m just...living with cancer.
@bridienixon I’m actually afraid to find “the dress”! The hunt has been keeping me busy, I’m not sure what I’ll do when I find it! But I decided I’m going to wear my scars with pride:)
Bless the heart of my dear fiancé, who has put up with a whole marathon of Say Yes to the Dress today.
@TheNewGenou It’s definitely not pretty here today.
@LymphNoMoNa Oh girl, I’ve been there. I started taking my patented “showerbaths”, where I stand as long as I can to wash, then I just lay down in the tub to catch my breath for the rinse portion.

@michaelsola I was once in a waiting room &amp; overheard a conversation between a mother &amp; daughter. The mom was adamant that she would never go for a colonoscopy because it was “disgusting”. It took everything in me not to stand up, lift up my shirt and show her the scar running down my belly.
@frankie_kat I hope your choice of topics are a bit more enriching than mine! (She says as she dives into a juicy list of wedding horror stories...)
On one hand, it makes me feel warm &amp; fuzzy that there are genuinely awesome people like this out there.

If I ever have a house again after living in the parking hellscape that is #NYC, I’m going to cherish my driveway. I’m going to pamper it w/cool rinses of fresh water in the summer, chase away snowflakes during winter, whisper sweet nothings to it &amp; sing it lullabies every night.
I find the psychology of the patient/doctor relationship fascinating. Don’t get me wrong, I want my docs to be scientists first &amp; foremost. But if they sit across from me w/tears in their eyes, it makes me feel like they’re more invested in my care.  		https://t.co/NzI1dgEz8V

@frankie_kat I agree, there are silver linings if you look for them. While it’s taken so much from me, it also appreciate my family &amp; friends more, it confirmed the strength of my relationship &amp; gave me purpose.
@frankie_kat It’s so frustrating, I’m sorry. I cut mine much shorter before treatment. I can’t say it really helps stop the loss, but the strands don’t get all wrapped up around my fingers as much when I wash it.
@TheSarahDeBord 🙋🏼‍♀️Also never told.
@pycior This is amazing.
@michaelsola @TheSarahDeBord I will happily accept any dog videos that come my way!
@j_marasa Oh that I definitely won’t do, I assure you. Some days you just let yourself feel sick, and that’s ok too. Today is actually a Parade day:)
Sometimes, I’m like, “HELL YEAH, I can deal with being sick and live my life” as I march out the door like the damn Grand Marshall of the Cancer Parade. Other days, I roll myself up in a blanket burrito and call it quits at 2pm.
@DanMurph777 @mlereese @realDonaldTrump I think our differences lie in what we consider illnesses. For instance, I feel that believing random conspiracy theories that you find on the internet to be a sickness.
This is kind of like the whole “if a tree fell in the woods” thing. If an insurance policy doesn’t actually cover you, is it really considered insurance? https://t.co/KI0mNTmSBn
@mlereese Even though I’m almost positive they’re bots (especially Mona with her 2 followers since 2013), I find engaging them is cathartic for me in some weird, twisted way.
@DanMurph777 @mlereese @realDonaldTrump What’s interesting is that I’ve found that a side effect from cancer is an overwhelming urge to protect what’s right in the world. When you’re not guaranteed a future yourself, you will do whatever it takes to ensure that the ones you leave behind are in good hands. 🤷🏼‍♀️
@Adapt_Overcome1 @KazmerPatti @NBeaucher @mlereese @realDonaldTrump Our democracy. That’s what he’s selling to Russia.
@suzibee48 @Avidguru That’s what I’ve been told as well! Sure, they may be some health benefits, but I think I’ll stick with the chemo;)
I subscribe to the idea that the only person who should give medical advice are those that have spent a lot of time and money to get degrees in the subject. 		So pipe it, Carol. I’m not treating my cancer with ingredients found on a spice rack.
@ReeseFCRC @FightCRC My folks at @sloan_kettering are on top of their game.😉
@mlereese Keep it in mind for next time!
.@SenGillibrand As your constituent, I’d love if you’d sponsor #S479. Access to screening for colorectal cancer is a priority to me as a voter and as a cancer patient. @FightCRC

@ReeseFCRC @leracrc @FightCRC Just had my scans today, should find out next week if it’s working!🤞🏻Thinking about it (with my very basic high school Biology knowledge), it does make sense if the goal is to interrupt the cell cycle. Although wearing a fanny pack for 48 hours isn’t exactly ideal...
@ReeseFCRC @leracrc I’ve been told this is why I have to wear my chemo-to-go (5-FU) for 48 hours as opposed to just sitting for an infusion. It’s so interesting.
A head’s up to Radiology departments everywhere: You guys could make the MRI process a lot more fun if you played the Top Gun theme song every time you loaded someone into the tube. I know I’d appreciate it...
@ThanksCancer Sending them right back!
@Squirrel3218 There’s always a certain amount of anxiety with the unknowns of chemo, but she’ll get the hang of it! Best of luck!
@kmcmillin1 @OstomyConnect One of the frustrating things about a story like this is that right after ostomy surgery, you’re still getting used to a new way of living and it’s so defeating when you have a Stoma mishap. I would never want anyone to think that’s how their future life would be.
@alexghrz Thank you!
@frankie_kat I imagine them going into a little huddle to discuss strategy.
Wondering why I’ve been especially irritated &amp; unfocused this week, then I realized that I have scans tomorrow &amp; now it makes sense. Scanxiety is fo real. That date on your calendar seeps into your subconscious &amp; makes you a wretched jerk for a week &amp; a half. It’s worse than PMS.
I know you have your hands full, @RepGraceMeng @SenSchumer @SenGillibrand, but could we do something about these scam robocalls? They’re mimicking the number of my oncologist’s office. It’s infuriating and devastating, especially when you’re expecting test results.
@frankie_kat The King of Mindfuckery, I tell you.
I gotta thank my body for at least picking and choosing which side effect it will have on any given day as opposed to piling them all on at once. Nausea day generally doesn’t coincide with bones jumping out of my skin day, so I’ll consider that a win.

@frankie_kat Indeed.
@frankie_kat It’s June of next year, so I have some time. But you know, you have these ideas of how you want to look on your wedding day, and I just always imagined long hair. I guess I’m not ready to give that up to cancer as well.
@frankie_kat When I was on FOLFOX, I lost some, but not a ton. Was able to get away with not shaving it. FOLFIRI has definitely had more of an effect. I also did 8 rounds last time vs 12 this time, so that may make a difference as well.
What up, weird side receding hairline. Still have more chemo ahead, contemplating the idea of shaving it so I stop crying in the shower everyday, but vain me wants to try to hold on to as much as possible for my wedding next year. The struggle is definitely real. https://t.co/9Ot0JC2Bzc

Gotta say I’m liking all the tips and tricks for colonoscopy prep in this thread. The Lemon Heads chaser is a new one, going to have to give that one a go.		(And don’t let the prep scare you, it’s still a million times easier than having full blown cancer, I promise you.) https://t.co/HnCuEkD1uN
@pintsizedMB @MortuaryReport Yes! Apple juice helps mask some of the taste. While the prep isn’t exactly a fun way to spend your Friday night, I can tell you that a colonoscopy is waaaay better than some of the crap I’ve had to deal with once I hit stage III colorectal cancer. Glad you’re getting screened.
@frankie_kat Haha giiiirl, I hear you. Thank God mine can appreciate a little bathroom humor.
@frankie_kat He’s definitely been kept🙂
@frankie_kat It was so awkward, and I’m really bad at having those types of talks. There may have been jazz hands involved at one point. So shocked he didn’t go running out the door.
@frankie_kat Did the same thing. Sat down for my first appointment with my oncologist, &amp; the following week I was at the fertility clinic learning how to give myself shots. Was quite the convo having to explain to a guy you’ve been dating for 2 months that you’re on fertility treatments...
And a necessary one. Colorectal cancer can’t be viewed as a disease for seniors anymore. There are way too many of us younger patients &amp; the surgeries/treatments used to treat it affect our lives differently than the older population (i.e. infertility, sexual issues, colostomies) https://t.co/opUDHd3RH2
Spotted some can’t we all just get along” posts today &amp; I’m here for it. I don’t understand not following people b/c they have different views. I’d rather learn about their perspective &amp; create a constructive counterpoint instead of just pointing fingers across the aisle🤷🏼‍♀️
@LovlyKatieLumps It’s just all so frustrating. I’m so sorry that you have to jump through hoops.
@alexghrz @darrenhayes Truth. Had I gone earlier for my colonoscopy (like in my 20’s when they said my tumor started), they could’ve just removed a polyp and my insurance co would’ve saved hundreds of thousands in paying for my care once it got to stage III. It’s so ass backwards (pun intended).
@observanttruth @LovlyKatieLumps It’s seriously insane. I looked at my statement from Sloan and saw my chemo infusion was $10K a pop. I have to go for 12 of them (at least). Thank God I have insurance, but I just don’t understand how it’s not better regulated...or at least how more people aren’t outraged by it.
@lpackard Ha, seriously. I can assure anyone considering it that it’s perhaps the anti-high. The big biohazard sticker on the bags don’t exactly scream “good times ahead” to me...
@observanttruth @LovlyKatieLumps They’re definitely expensive, not denying that. But going for infusion &amp; the costs of the pre-meds, hydration, and having someone administer the IV seems greater than a pill. In the end, it really all boils down to the the failure to regulate drug prices in general.
Sigh...even universal care isn’t without its faults. I don’t understand why oral chemo wouldn’t be covered when it’s obviously a necessity. Nobody says, “let me just pop this chemo pill for fun”... https://t.co/HG8Rat01Dw
@LovlyKatieLumps Why isn’t oral chemo covered?? It seems like a no-brainer to pay for a pill instead of an infused treatment that costs more to administer. This is crazy and I’m outraged for you.
Sure, we can’t afford to pay for the health care of those who have bravely fought for our country...but guys, our new Space Force is going to be liiiiit. Can’t wait to see the Starship Troopers in the military parade...🤦🏼‍♀️ https://t.co/NdOU9w9gnH

@cancerrealtalk Hahaha truth.
@cancerrealtalk I get it twice, they hydrate me when I’m sitting for my first infusion, then I get hydrated again when I disconnect after 48 hours. I was having some severe dehydration issues in the beginning, so they set me up for a standing date for a second round.
@cancerrealtalk I get hydration when I go for my disconnect from my chemo to go &amp; had to stop with the steroids once they determined I’m diabetic. They were throwing my glucose levels up to astronomical levels.

Not for nothing, but why would anyone that complains about the “coastal elites” defend someone that threw away $80 worth of sushi?

@LauraConsalto In my America, we’re seen as champions of human rights, beacons of morality and strength on the world stage. We don’t make friends with dictators that suppress the rights of their people, we fight them.
@LauraConsalto In my America, you don’t have to put yourself into a hole with hundreds of thousands of dollars of debt in order to receive an education.
@LauraConsalto In my America, the chronically ill &amp; seriously injured should have the right to affordable, accessible treatment without being told that their life is too costly to save.
@LauraConsalto In my America, children aren’t locked in cages and forced into deportation hearings without any comprehension of what is happening, surrounded by strange adults that don’t speak their language.
@LauraConsalto For example, in my version of America, kids aren’t shot in school on a fairly regular basis &amp; politicians don’t shrug their shoulders and say, “well, it’s a damn shame, but there’s nothing we can do about it.”
@LauraConsalto Ma’am, I’ve learned that one of the best ways to turn off anyone from hearing a point that you’re trying to make is by starting it with an insult. The beauty of America is that we can all have opinions on how it should be run.
@LauraConsalto Thank you. On the contrary, I am not opposed to a secure America, &amp; proudly have family members fighting for this country, I just disagree with the methods currently being used. I’m not intolerant, I just made a joke using the very words that have been thrown at me from one side.

Darling,		While this war has been tiresome, I don’t expect it to last. Red Hat casualties are mounting. They choose not to treat their wounded brethren, instead they just scream “I’M NOT PAYING FOR YOUR HEALTHCARE” &amp; leave them for dead.		Yours Always, A	#secondcivilwarletters

@enenbee @LoggheMD @fdossa However, as a young colorectal cancer patient that was scared to death about having an ostomy, it impacts my life far less than I ever thought. The trick to living well with a stoma is to accept the fact that you have it. Then it’s a piece of cake (and dare I say convenient...).
@enenbee @LoggheMD @fdossa An important aspect of living well with an ostomy that tends to be overlooked in surgical prep is finding the right supplies. I know hospitals have preferred vendors, but it took hiring an indie WOC nurse to evaluate my stoma &amp; hook me up w/the right products before I felt ok.
@DrJohnCav @GYRIG Thank you!
Folded the laundry tonight and realized that my half was strictly pajamas &amp; underwear. I literally just live in loungewear now.
@realDonaldTrump Oh honey.
@ARosen380 @ViolentKuchar @FirstDescents Engaged to a guy that couldn’t care less. They’re out there. And honestly, it’s a good thing that we have something that makes us really scrutinize character. I wasted far too much time on the wrong ones beforehand...
@Smilegreatday @dogeatdog98 @desiringthelord @SOL_refreshtree @Kafkasrecruit @RandPaul @All100Senators While I don’t subscribe to the whole “fake news” argument, I did go to school for journalism &amp; believe that anything can be swayed in one direction depending on vernacular. When I want facts on policy, I go to .gov sources. Although I’m not sure about those these days either...
@Smilegreatday @dogeatdog98 @desiringthelord @SOL_refreshtree @Kafkasrecruit @RandPaul @All100Senators Same here. And I paid little attention to healthcare before I really needed it. Sigh...I wish I could go back to those years when I was blissfully ignorant...
@Smilegreatday @dogeatdog98 @desiringthelord @SOL_refreshtree @Kafkasrecruit @RandPaul @All100Senators When you vote, do you consider this in your decision? There has been a lot of talk about entitlement reform to offset the deficit caused by the tax cuts. This would only exacerbate the situation for people that rely on it &amp; who have paid into it for years.
@dogeatdog98 @Smilegreatday @desiringthelord @SOL_refreshtree @Kafkasrecruit @RandPaul @All100Senators Couldn’t agree with this more.
@Sam_x5 @derbybbb @petereynaiii @Kythma @desiringthelord @SOL_refreshtree @Kafkasrecruit @RandPaul @All100Senators I’m truly so sorry, it must’ve been infuriating and devastating. But if you’re stuck with that or no coverage at all because you can’t work, which one do you choose? There has to be something...
@dogeatdog98 @Smilegreatday @desiringthelord @SOL_refreshtree @Kafkasrecruit @RandPaul @All100Senators 100%. My chemo shouldn’t cost $10K a pop. The cost of care is completely ambiguous and unregulated.
@Smilegreatday @dogeatdog98 @desiringthelord @SOL_refreshtree @Kafkasrecruit @RandPaul @All100Senators I agree that I don’t want the gov’t involved in my healthcare. I just don’t understand the argument that it would be charity, when everyone would be paying into it, that’s all. Aside from that, I just want protections for the sick so we’re not kicked off coverage when we need it.
@dogeatdog98 @desiringthelord @SOL_refreshtree @Kafkasrecruit @RandPaul @All100Senators You may have restored my faith.
@Smilegreatday @SOL_refreshtree @Kafkasrecruit @RandPaul @All100Senators I’m sorry your family had to go through this. I’m not angry, I’m just frustrated. I do call my representatives, but the American people really drive the ship. I’m talking about it on Twitter to try to explain to voters why a complete repeal is wrong. Demand more of our reps.
@Smilegreatday @desiringthelord @SOL_refreshtree @Kafkasrecruit @RandPaul @All100Senators No, it’s really not. I’m saying that coverage for pre-existing conditions shouldn’t be denied and that lifetime caps on coverage should not be re-instituted. I’m trying to protect my coverage so that I don’t have to rely on charity to survive.
@dogeatdog98 @desiringthelord @SOL_refreshtree @Kafkasrecruit @RandPaul @All100Senators And thank you for engaging in a constructive way. I’m really tired of being called “dumb” or “stupid” because I’m trying to preserve my health coverage instead of relying on the charity of others to survive.
@dogeatdog98 @desiringthelord @SOL_refreshtree @Kafkasrecruit @RandPaul @All100Senators I just need people to fight for these protections. That’s all I’m out here chatting with people on Twitter for. I completely understand how expensive healthcare costs are, but don’t vote at the expense of your fellow American. Vote out the people pocketing the $.
@derbybbb @Sam_x5 @petereynaiii @Kythma @desiringthelord @SOL_refreshtree @Kafkasrecruit @RandPaul @All100Senators Yes, thank you. While may not agree that it was designed to fail, I understand that it has its faults. I just wonder what more time would’ve done if the individual mandate wasn’t repealed.
@Sam_x5 @derbybbb @petereynaiii @Kythma @desiringthelord @SOL_refreshtree @Kafkasrecruit @RandPaul @All100Senators But unfortunately, there are times when gov’t subsidized healthcare is needed. I try my damndest to work so that I don’t have to rely on it.
@Sam_x5 @derbybbb @petereynaiii @Kythma @desiringthelord @SOL_refreshtree @Kafkasrecruit @RandPaul @All100Senators I’m so sorry that your mother had to go through this, wouldn’t wish it on anyone. I completely agree that the gov’t as it stands could not maintain a sufficient healthcare system. We have to push the lobbyists out &amp; ensure our legislators are working for the good of the people.
@dogeatdog98 @desiringthelord @SOL_refreshtree @Kafkasrecruit @RandPaul @All100Senators I completely agree with you. The problems go much deeper than figuring out who is going to pay. I’m fine with private insurance as long as no one is denied coverage once they actually need it. If you pay in, you deserve to be covered, regardless if it’s an ins plan or gov’t.
@dogeatdog98 @desiringthelord @SOL_refreshtree @Kafkasrecruit @RandPaul @All100Senators And I promise you that I would be there to pay for it if the tables were turned.
@dogeatdog98 @desiringthelord @SOL_refreshtree @Kafkasrecruit @RandPaul @All100Senators And all could benefit equally from healthcare as well. Good health is not guaranteed for anyone and could be taken from you at a moment’s notice. Just because you don’t need as much care as I do at the moment doesn’t mean that you’re not going to need it in the future.
@dogeatdog98 @desiringthelord @SOL_refreshtree @Kafkasrecruit @RandPaul @All100Senators Yes, thank you. I just don’t understand why gov’t subsidized healthcare would be charity. We pay taxes. We commute to work on tax-funded roads. I don’t have kids, but I still pay for children go to school. We’re all protected by a tax-funded military. Why is it different?
@Sam_x5 @derbybbb @petereynaiii @Kythma @desiringthelord @SOL_refreshtree @Kafkasrecruit @RandPaul @All100Senators What I’m advocating for is the protections afforded to the chronically ill by the Affordable Care Act. I don’t want anyone to be denied insurance because of a pre-existing condition or a lifetime cap on coverage. That’s wrong.
@Sam_x5 @derbybbb @petereynaiii @Kythma @desiringthelord @SOL_refreshtree @Kafkasrecruit @RandPaul @All100Senators I pay insurance premiums too, which does contribute to the care of your family. It’s a pool, that’s how insurance works. The healthy offset the cost of the sick. You pay for me, &amp; I pay for you. I never said socialized medicine is without its faults. I agree with you.
@dogeatdog98 @desiringthelord @SOL_refreshtree @Kafkasrecruit @RandPaul @All100Senators I don’t consider that charity. I pay into the system, so I’m receiving the benefits from it.
Twitter is the ultimate exercise in restraint. I routinely have to remind myself that insults will never make anyone come around to your point of view, even if they’re being lobbed at you first.		Also, some people are just horrible and don’t deserve a response.
@Sam_x5 @derbybbb @petereynaiii @Kythma @desiringthelord @SOL_refreshtree @Kafkasrecruit @RandPaul @All100Senators I never said that I would refuse charity, I just don’t believe it should be considered a primary source of funding for anyone’s healthcare. Also, I pay into insurance that covers your family as well. It’s not a one way street, it’s collectively contributing so that all pay less.
@fisherlady1960 @desiringthelord @SOL_refreshtree @Kafkasrecruit @RandPaul @All100Senators Ma’am, I have read the legal filing that states that the current Department of Justice will not defend the pre-existing conditions clause in court. That’s not trying to keep it. https://t.co/vLliToRSHW
@SOL_refreshtree @fisherlady1960 @desiringthelord @Kafkasrecruit @RandPaul @All100Senators Thank you.
@fisherlady1960 @desiringthelord @SOL_refreshtree @Kafkasrecruit @RandPaul @All100Senators I am not completely for socialized healthcare. I know that it’s not perfect, and our government as it stands now certainly couldn’t run it competently. I’m advocating for the protections given to the chronically ill that are being threatened by this administration.
@fisherlady1960 @desiringthelord @SOL_refreshtree @Kafkasrecruit @RandPaul @All100Senators Wow. No. I’m not trying to be a martyr for anyone. In fact, I’ve voted Republican in past elections. I’m just trying to advocate for protections for those with pre-existing conditions &amp; keep a ban on lifetime caps on coverage so that I can keep my healthcare.
@derbybbb @SOL_refreshtree @Kafkasrecruit @RandPaul @All100Senators Thank you for saying that, it just makes sense that the more people that pay into the system, the less it costs for all. Granted, the cost of care is still unregulated, which is ridiculous and where most of my fury lies.
@derbybbb @SOL_refreshtree @Kafkasrecruit @RandPaul @All100Senators I wasn’t planning on getting sick at 31, I thought I had a longer future than I have now. But reinstituting lifetime caps and removing protections for pre-existing conditions could also greatly affect you and your family in the future. That’s what I’m fighting against. For all.
@derbybbb @SOL_refreshtree @Kafkasrecruit @RandPaul @All100Senators Twitter is not a perfect medium for communication. My argument is that the ACA and the protections it has afforded people that would have been kicked off their plans previously should not be completely dismantled.
@AOsvatic @SOL_refreshtree @Kafkasrecruit @RandPaul @All100Senators No one has denied me treatment yet, my comment is a hypothetical situation should I have to stop working and the ACA is fully repealed. Getting alternative healthcare when you have at least 5 pre-existing conditions would be impossible.
@derbybbb @petereynaiii @Kythma @desiringthelord @SOL_refreshtree @Kafkasrecruit @RandPaul @All100Senators That’s not true. In fact they put together a whole plan called the Affordable Care Act that was attempting to stabilize the markets and keep insurance private, but it’s being systematically dismantled.
@derbybbb @SOL_refreshtree @Kafkasrecruit @RandPaul @All100Senators I never said I was denied healthcare, I am lucky enough to have insurance, but that could change any day now. If protections for pre-existing conditions and lifetime caps are reinstated, I could lose my coverage. So could millions of other Americans.
@barbiebrox @SOL_refreshtree @Kafkasrecruit @RandPaul @All100Senators Yes, you are correct. Thanks to the Affordable Care Act, people like me are covered. However, if it is repealed, the protections for pre-existing conditions are repealed, the lifetime caps on care are reinstituted, you can be damn sure I will not have healthcare.
@canbarleydecide @desiringthelord @SOL_refreshtree @Kafkasrecruit @RandPaul @All100Senators For the millionth time in this thread, I am not taking anything I haven’t paid into myself. I’ve worked for years.
@canbarleydecide @desiringthelord @SOL_refreshtree @Kafkasrecruit @RandPaul @All100Senators No, it’s called taxes. You pay them for all sorts of things, why is healthcare any different?
@LovetheNRA @SOL_refreshtree @Kafkasrecruit @RandPaul @All100Senators Yes, I paid into the Medicare/Medicaid system for years. That’s healthcare that I deserve to use. Just as you would be able to if needed.
@LovetheNRA @SOL_refreshtree @Kafkasrecruit @RandPaul @All100Senators I did. I paid into the system for years, so yes, I am owed something.
@frankie_kat @BowelCancerAust If it gives you any hope, I didn’t lose enough hair for it to be noticeable when I was on FOLFOX (and I’m definitely not genetically blessed in the thick hair department).
@petereynaiii @Kythma @desiringthelord @SOL_refreshtree @Kafkasrecruit @RandPaul @All100Senators Thank you. I’m sorry to hear about your family members. It is just not something everyone plans for (or has the ability to save for when they have crazy student loans/rent to pay) especially when you’re hit with it at a young age.
@petereynaiii @Kythma @desiringthelord @SOL_refreshtree @Kafkasrecruit @RandPaul @All100Senators The problem is that everyone is fighting about whose responsibility it is to pay for the astronomical costs of care, and no one is doing anything about actually reducing the cost of care so that it’s affordable.
@petereynaiii @Kythma @desiringthelord @SOL_refreshtree @Kafkasrecruit @RandPaul @All100Senators You’re going off the rails here. If our government wasn’t run by lobbyists for pharmaceutical and insurance companies and our elected officials were forced to divest their interests in the medical industries, then maybe we would have a working healthcare plan in this country.
@petereynaiii @Kythma @desiringthelord @SOL_refreshtree @Kafkasrecruit @RandPaul @All100Senators I got cancer at 31, in the upswing of my career. Please do not lecture me on planning and how that could’ve saved me from almost a million dollars in unforeseen healthcare costs. It’s impossible.
@Kythma @desiringthelord @SOL_refreshtree @Kafkasrecruit @RandPaul @All100Senators It’s paying dues for living in an organized society, not charity. We pay our taxes &amp; we drive on tax-funded roads, children go to tax-funded schools, we’re protected by a tax-funded military. We need these things in order to succeed as a whole. Why is healthcare different?
@swebs @SOL_refreshtree @Kafkasrecruit @RandPaul @All100Senators Did you have healthcare?
For Twitter record, yes, I am a cancer patient and no, I do not feel sorry for myself because of it. It gave me purpose. I am here to advocate for others &amp; for my own future. You can come at me &amp; I will still fight for your access to healthcare even if you won’t fight for mine.
@swebs @SOL_refreshtree @Kafkasrecruit @RandPaul @All100Senators For the record, I appreciate the people in this thread that offered some sort of solution/empathy. I talk about this not for sympathy for myself, I’m ok. It’s for the sake of others that don’t have the support that I have. Trying to spread understanding. Lord knows we need it.
@Kythma @desiringthelord @SOL_refreshtree @Kafkasrecruit @RandPaul @All100Senators No. That’s called living in a society. You contribute to the common good.
@swebs @SOL_refreshtree @Kafkasrecruit @RandPaul @All100Senators I very much do not feel sorry for myself, if you read any of my previous comments you would see that.
@Resus2Runner @Lin_Dawe @VBlush @iasupport @ColostomyUK I wore mine in natural hot springs in Iceland for hours. As long as you have the right supplies, there’s not much it should hold you back from.
@desiringthelord @SOL_refreshtree @Kafkasrecruit @RandPaul @All100Senators Thank you, but no one should have to rely on charity to simply live.
@Liberty2113 @SOL_refreshtree @Kafkasrecruit @RandPaul @All100Senators I’ve always been middle of the road, but on this subject, I’m firmly left. I’m not asking for anyone to take care of me. I’m asking for programs that I’ve paid into be used to offset the cost of my care, and for our legislators to stop taking kickbacks from pharma &amp; insurance.
@agent_it @TheRealDeb1 @SOL_refreshtree @Kafkasrecruit @RandPaul @All100Senators Thank you. I’m well cared for with a wonderful family and support system. I consider myself very lucky. It’s the millions of other patients like me that I worry more about.
@TheRealDeb1 @SOL_refreshtree @Kafkasrecruit @RandPaul @All100Senators Thank you. Not to make this a sob story, but my care requires constant upkeep: indefinite chemo, medical devices, regular meds &amp; three month scans to monitor. I’d be at the hospital every week. I don’t wish this on anyone &amp; I’ll fight till the death for everyone’s right to care.
@Kafkasrecruit @SOL_refreshtree @RandPaul @All100Senators It’s frustrating to be called a leech on society when you want to work. You want to contribute, but you physically can’t.
@SOL_refreshtree @Kafkasrecruit @RandPaul @All100Senators Thank you and I understand. I just need more people to see that the rug can be pulled out from under you at any time, you could be left unable to work &amp; without healthcare. It can affect anyone that isn’t independently wealthy.
@SOL_refreshtree @Kafkasrecruit @RandPaul @All100Senators Thank you. No, I have not yet lost my insurance, but I very well could if I can’t go back to work. That’s what I’m fighting for. There are millions of people like me, people that have worked and paid into the system that got dealt a bad hand.
@SOL_refreshtree @Kafkasrecruit @RandPaul @All100Senators I was healthy and “worked for that shit” for 15 years before I got cancer. Please tell me how I can continue to “work for that shit” when I can’t physically leave my apartment due to chemo treatments and why I should be denied healthcare now that I actually need it?
@lfsmith2111 @Education4Libs I’m sorry, but keeping my health care is pretty important.

@NBCNightlyNews Thank you, @Ocasio2018. We need more of you.

@BarlowAdams @lpackard I agree, and I certainly don’t fault anyone for trying to help, it feels good to know they’re thinking of me. However, I also really want them to know that a daily spoonful of turmeric isn’t necessarily going to save them from the same fate.
@BarlowAdams People constantly tell me to try a plant-based diet. I don’t have the heart to tell all of them that my surgically re-routed digestive system means one piece of celery could send me to the ER. Trust me, if I could just go to town on some asparagus for the rest of my life, I would
Forget fancy jewelry. What you really need, ladies, is a man that will hunt down the right flavor of V8 Splash, bring home a bouquet of flowers from the corner market and do a dance while he cleans the kitchen just to make you smile. #dreamboat
I can’t tell you how much I love this rendition of Stand By Me and the fact that they included it in the #royalwedding It’s such a sweet, personal touch.
After my surgery, I can never eat celery again...which, coincidentally, also makes it the only thing I want to eat every day of my freaking life.
Fun thing to get engaged while going through chemo. Have to explain to everyone that wants to see my ring that these fancy black specks in my fingernails are from chemo, and I’m not dirty. So weird. https://t.co/cTfLbtmNKT
@rstasyk @DrJenGunter Regardless of what you call it (and the fact that legal marijuana is regulated by the state making it far safer than illegal recreational marijuana), isn’t the fact that it does have medicinal qualities that help patients the most important thing? It’s hardly a fallacy.
@rstasyk @DrJenGunter With all due respect, as a patient going through chemo, I can tell you that legal medical marijuana has helped me when traditional pills could not (i.e. oral oils to curb nausea when I couldn’t keep pills down long enough to work).
I can’t believe I agreed to marry a laurel.
At the halfway mark. Chemo 6 of 12 today, which means my brain has zero capacity for anything that isn’t a @BuzzFeed quiz about which Freddie Mercury I am (for the record, I’m “King Freddie” because I’m a “fabulous human being who radiates joy, with a little sass”...).
Hit the nail on the head again, @mlereese. I have approximately 4-5 “good days” in between my biweekly chemo treatments. I try to go out and have a life during this time, since I’m stuck in my apartment the other 10 days. I wonder what people think when they see me out and about. https://t.co/2PC47VlnCo

@ARosen380 @TheSarahDeBord They’re out there! I just had to learn that the easier it became for me to accept, the easier it was for him. Now it’s a non-issue (with the exception of trying to find the right  wedding dress silhouette to hide the pouch...)
@TheSarahDeBord @ARosen380 ❤️ @ARosen380! I met my (now) fiancé 2 mos before I was dx’d. Thought for sure he’d go running when I found out I needed an ostomy. When I woke up from surgery, he was sitting across from my bed with flowers in his hand. The right ones don’t mind (&amp; the wrong ones don’t matter)
@cancerrealtalk The phrase “mind over matter” has never rang more true.
Sometimes the determining factor in whether you’ll have a “good” #chemo day or a “bad” chemo day can simply come down to waking up and making a conscious decision to focus on what you do have, rather than what you’re missing out on.
@united Thank you. Will this exception be permanent as there are no other options for military on Guam to get their animals safely off the island once their tour is over?
@united A new article states that military families in Guam will only be able to fly with their dogs until the ban takes effect on 6/18. Do you have this extension in writing?

Nurses are amazing. I hope the incredible team at @sloan_kettering know how important they are to us patients. #NationalNursesDay https://t.co/AMtkoqdkOa
We’ve waited 2 years to get engaged. Mainly because I wanted a good stretch of time where cancer didn’t have a hold on me to plan a wedding. After recurrence #2, we stopped waiting for cancer. It’s time to be a bride. Now cancer will wait for me. https://t.co/wy6lM36Nlq
Watching a child cry “I don’t want to go” when they get called into the Chemo Suite is the most heartbreaking thing to witness.
@HealthCoachJaye @sloan_kettering I second this!
@suzibee48 @cancerrealtalk I have my own informal little group of other patients that I text with frequently. It helps to have people to commiserate with that really understand what you’re going through and can share some tips.
There’s something relatable to @SenJohnMcCain ‘s preface regarding his cancer. I’ve been dealing w/this for almost 4 years, but after recurrence #2, my drive to speak out has become more intense. Even though I’m not terminal at this point, having it in your body always leaves a ? https://t.co/JFSEaQIev3

@mlereese Yes, I get a shot of it during treatment. Do you get dizzy when you get that, or is it just me?
@suzibee48 Yes, they just told me about the Claritin! It does seem to help the “bones jumping out of your skin” feeling. When it comes down to it, we just do what we have to do, and my method is to try to keep it light when I can. I truly wish all the best for you and your DIL. Xx
@suzibee48 It’s definitely wearing on the body &amp; spirit, especially towards the end. I will say, although I may complain about the Neulasta side effects, the last shot really did the job of boosting my WBC count. It’s nice being able to leave my house again!

@laurenhindman So frustrating.
The first night of chemo, when the steroids are at their peak, I often lie awake and sing “insomNIAAHH” repeatedly to myself to the tune of the Activia commercial jingle. Just thought you should know.
@united Would there be advanced notification if this changes in the future so they could arrange to send the dogs ahead of any possible future ban?
@united Thank you for the quick response!
Dear @united: My sister moved her family - including their dog - to Guam before this ban took place. Please consider exceptions for military families that have no other options to get their furry family members back when their tour is over.		https://t.co/3k3YfAJO9P
@Nicole_Cliffe Uhhhh Cancer. Was told it was hemorrhoids. 🤷🏼‍♀️
@askUHC Thank you! I don’t have any immediate issues, but it’s helpful to know this resource exists.
Perhaps I should stop Tweeting about it and just work on my @ABCSharkTank pitch instead...
And less of a game of telephone between patient -&gt; office staff -&gt; nurse -&gt; oncologist
I know many patients that don’t tell their doctors everything because they don’t want to be a burden (myself included), but that’s a hindrance to docs trying to do their jobs and connect the dots. It would all be right there for the doctor to check before they meet in clinic.
@DrJohnCav @OhioHealth @askUHC I do, but I don’t always feel like my symptoms warrant an email (I would seriously be emailing daily). I want them to know what’s happening for the record, to help them connect the dots, but don’t need to feel like the girl who cried wolf.
Tagging you, @sloan_kettering ;)
But honestly, it would open up communication immensely and docs can see when side effects kick in in real time. Less bothersome for office staff fielding calls and emails as well.
I wish there were a social network where patients could have profiles that enable them to post symptoms they are having at any given time. Docs could check in (when they have the time. Short supply, I know). I never remember to tell them everything by the time I’m back in clinic.
@DrJohnCav This is exactly how I look sitting in front of my air conditioner right now.
Round 5 of chemo today and the hot flashes are getting progressively more intense. Pretty sure I may spontaneously combust by round 12.
@HealthCoachJaye @sloan_kettering Would love to share more of the young adult CRC patient perspective with the team at Sloan in regards to the lasting side effects from radiation as well. It’s just a different story for us than it is for the older community.
It really stinks when you know your significant other wants to go to a concert, but can’t because you have treatment and won’t be up to going. It’s bad enough when it stops me from doing things, but when it stops him, it’s even worse. Cancer sucks.
@HealthCoachJaye I love that @sloan_kettering is doing this. The emotional side of being an early-onset colorectal cancer can be more difficult to overcome than the surgeries and treatments sometimes. If they’re putting together a patient group, I’d be in!
@HealthCoachJaye I definitely do

@TheSarahDeBord @GYRIG Maybe more humor is a tactic that could work. I know it’s helped me deal with a cancer than many perceive as embarrassing. It’s a serious disease, but fear doesn’t have to be the only way to raise awareness.
@TheSarahDeBord @GYRIG But I also don’t want to pound people with statistics. My thought process is if I could at least make this situation interesting enough that people want to follow me and come back to hear what I have to say, then maybe they’ll stick around when the conversation gets serious.
@TheSarahDeBord @GYRIG I think it’s about putting CRC in context and sharing stories in a unique way. I’m really just at the start to all of this, and I know I’m not going to save the world with selfies. That’s not the point.
@NUCLEARnicole Two friends of mine that have it literally live next to one another &amp; I can’t tell you how many high school friends have reached out to me privately to ask about my symptoms. One ended up going to my gastro and they found 3 polyps that were all close to turning cancerous.
@TheSarahDeBord @GYRIG I have some theories!
@lpackard @mlereese I certainly wasn’t running marathons, but I was active and never smoked. Was told that my initial tumor had likely developed in my mid 20’s. There’s something up.
A friend of mine discovered she had colorectal cancer at age 30 just weeks after running the NYC Marathon. There have to be other environmental factors that are causing early onset CRC. Calling on researchers to dig deeper... https://t.co/PjARTIoTLb
Remember when the list of side effects for one of my chemo drugs said “possible voice changes”? I think it’s happening. Thrice today I was mid-sentence &amp; my vocal cord did this weird spasm &amp; crapped out. I just hope my new voice is more Mariah Carey than James Earl Jones.
Geez. It’s kind of creepy that you write a hashtag-less post about getting engaged and immediately have 200 new Instagram follows that are all suspiciously wedding photographers.
Man, my Twitter follow list is an interesting cross-section of reality dating show contestants and various political pundits. I really feel like I have my finger on the pulse of America.
@alexghrz I will now
Showerbaths are my new thing. You know, when you’re too tired to stand the entire time in the shower, so you just sit down in the tub, close your eyes and pretend that you were caught in some exotic tropical rain shower.
@mlereese It’s my new zen.
If there’s any advice I could give to anyone that’s going to be stuck in bed on a long-term basis, it’s start following pages that regularly feature cake decorating videos.
@medicalaxioms @GavinPrestonMD Thank you. This is important to a patient’s state of mind. Most of the time, we feel like a number that’s constantly being poked and prodded and as such, anger is misplaced. We fight to get through to our docs and have them see us as a human — and a very scared human at that.

@Polybius2nd @JoeBiden @michaelshure @BidenCancer This is a horrible comment. Don’t equate your personal politics with terminal cancer.
@joeydemoura @JoeBiden @BidenCancer That statistic seems incorrect (this coming from a girl that is literally attached to a chemo IV as we speak). Chemo itself is never considered a cure. It’s merely a method of shrinking the cells to get to the point where surgery or radiation is an option. But yes, way too costly

@j_marasa Oh I’m so sorry she had to go through this. No worries, I’m not upset, just on a personal mission to change the stigma surrounding it. As a patient, I have a card and have benefitted greatly from it, but am still not comfortable using my pen in public.
@j_marasa @SenGillibrand @CoryBooker @SenSanders They’re trying to make a change that could greatly impact our economy in a positive way. Even John Boehner is jumping on the marijuana bandwagon now. Also, I’m from NY too and am a pretty sincere person. Please don’t generalize.
@j_marasa @SenGillibrand @CoryBooker @SenSanders This is obviously not the same. Marijuana has medicinal properties that many have benefitted from. It’s less destructive than alcohol.
@SenGillibrand @CoryBooker @SenSanders Marijuana usage for cancer patients is a life changer. The pharmaceuticals given to offset chemo side effects like nausea can be ineffective if you can’t keep pills down. Vapor or tincture can alleviate this problem.
@realDonaldTrump Not for nothing, but your track record for nominating “the best” hasn’t been very good. What’s the turnover rate now?
I was all ready for a good insomnia rant here, but then I realized that the only available poop emoji has a smiley face and I didn’t think 💩 accurately portrays my anger.

Going back into chemo knowing what you’re going to be dealing with is one of the toughest, but bravest decisions anyone can make.

I’m a big believer in putting cancer in context.

Is there anything more ironic than an email with the subject line “Stop Unwanted Emails”?
Short answer: yes. I’ll give you an example: when you’re prescribed a litany of pills to combat nausea and vomiting from chemo but you can’t keep the meds down long enough to be effective. The option for vapor oil or tincture would be a life-changer. https://t.co/sxazrw0oYH

@ladyoutlander72 @RepLeeZeldin @HouseIntelComm I care more about the future of this country than I do protecting any politician or special interest. @RepLeeZeldin fought for this country, which is something I’ve always admired. I’m just asking for him to remember why and step out of partisan politics.
@ladyoutlander72 @RepLeeZeldin @HouseIntelComm Call for hearings. Write one of his letters to the DOJ. Call on Senate leadership to take a stand. Maybe call publicly for Trump to enforce the Russian sanctions that were passed by his governing body that remain dormant. The lack of action across the board is partisan crap.
@ladyoutlander72 @RepLeeZeldin @HouseIntelComm Of course he has jurisdiction. It’s literally part of his job to keep the executive branch in check and hold the president accountable for his actions. I have a major problem with hypocrisy, especially from a government official that I voted for. Everyone should.

@PapaJonas @people @FightCRC Yup, at age 31 when they found my stage III tumor. Thank you for using your platform to raise awareness, @PapaJonas! Wishing you many more years of health!
So I’m reading through the pages of side effects for my new treatment drugs and it says one of them may result in “voice changes”. I really don’t know what that means, but now all I can think about is how I’m going to be like a bald pubescent boy for 6 months.
@michaelsola Yes, thankfully! Just not the taste, sadly...
Today I learned that cancer has shades of grey. You either have it, you don’t, or you live with it in your body and periodically and keep it at bay. I’m in the latter category, so my groundhog showed 6 more months of chemo. We have to defeat this, @FightCRC
@Nicole_Cliffe I was in the pre-surgical area with my bf &amp; family. After they gave me an epidural, I demanded that my boyfriend sing Enrique Iglesias’s “Hero” to me before I would let them wheel me to the OR.

@alexghrz Thank you for sharing your story as well. Grief is overwhelming and I’m so sorry for your loss. Xx
@alexghrz I remember the exact moment it fully hit me that I had cancer — it was in a parking lot  AFTER I had gone through all of my radiation and chemo. Before that, I was on autopilot. To judge anyone’s reaction to something tragic without experiencing it yourself is foolish.
@alexghrz The conspiracy theorists that attack the response to a tragedy are the worst of the worst.
I’m just going to go ahead and save @TIME the trouble and declare the #parkland teens Persons of the Year right now. I hope you guys know how powerful your words are.

Unless they show interest in veering from the standard course of treatment recommended by their doctor, or are specifically requesting information, please steer clear of this topic and simply offer your support of whatever path they may choose. #colorectalcancer [End]
I understand that it’s all well-intentioned, but a person’s choice of treatment is extremely personal and should remain as such.
Please, please, please don’t offer up unsolicited advice that includes a “miracle cure” that you read about online somewhere. It is extremely dangerous to influence someone that is in a fragile state to pursue any treatment that does not have solid evidence of efficacy.
[THREAD] If there’s any piece of advice that I could give anyone that is struggling with what to say — or rather not say — to someone that has been recently diagnosed with cancer it’s this:
@DonaldJTrumpJr People who live in glass houses shouldn’t throw stones.
Did I get this right? Is this actually happening? I’m half-seriously asking. [END]
In turn, Trump decides to instigate an international incident with North Korea (on freaking Twitter) in an effort to bury the news of the Fusion GPS op-ed that basically confirms allllll of the Russian scandal. /5
Fusion GPS then gets pissed and writes a NY Times op-ed divulging all of this information, culminating in a call on Congress to release the transcripts of their testimony to prove it. /4
They chose to do nothing about it.		There have since been various leaks regarding all of this and a smear campaign was then launched against Fusion GPS. /3
The federal government was then warned that Trump was compromised by Russia and that the Russians were actively sabotaging the campaign. /2
[THREAD] So let me try &amp; get this straight: Fusion GPS, a firm hired by first, the RNC then the DNC to dig up dirt on Trump during the campaign discovered that Trump has been trying to close real estate deals in Russia for years and was ultimately being blackmailed by Putin.
I’ve officially reached the point where I’m not sure if I’m becoming a conspiracy theorist or if what’s going down in our gov’t right now is just this corrupt and insane. Leaning towards the latter. #TrumpRussia  https://t.co/VbdFYAPzKS

@J_EstradaMD @DrAndrewAlbert Now living with it for almost 2 years, I️ wish I️ could go back and tell my pre-surgery self how easy it is to live with.
@J_EstradaMD @DrAndrewAlbert Honestly, when being told that it was permanent colostomy or death, it took a lot of convincing for me too. Hard pill to swallow at 32.
@alexghrz It kills me that they cancelled that show.
I...I️ think I’m developing a crush on Robert Mueller.
@CCAlliance @MensHealthMag @christasgobba With a stage III diagnosis at 31, I can attest to that.

I was given a 30% chance of survival in December. My only shot is regular screening and early detection.
I've fought cancer twice, but the idea of leaving him is the scariest thought.
He stayed w me thru chemo, radiation, countless surgeries. He kissed my scars and told me he loved them because they kept me here.
