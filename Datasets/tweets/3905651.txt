@MAKeliher Romantic? Is your job romantic or are you gainfully employed in a thriving bookstore that people love going to?
@MAKeliher That's not nearly as farcical as the idea that no business can survive in the shadow of Amazon.
@MAKeliher ...value beyond that, maybe your job SHOULD go away.
@MAKeliher ... or B) take their innovative skills and talents elsewhere. Amazon's advantage is automation and infrastructure. If you offer no...
@MAKeliher Alt perspective: Innovators like those at BA should A) be good enough to survive or thrive against Amazon (like you are) or ...
@MAKeliher I'm not suggesting Amazon has never caused a job to be lost or has never caused any harm. But this "BA is going to die" story is silly.
@MAKeliher Second, if AMZ thinks it can kill BA w/ 4 (hypothetical) staff to BA's 100, A) Amazon's going to fail or B) BA is fat and should die anyway.
@MAKeliher First, I'm suggesting Blue Apron wouldn't have to axe staff if it weren't public. Its decline is simply bc "the market" is scared for them.
@MAKeliher ...without hiring more people. They're changing the jobs landscape, shifting jobs, but that's not the same as outright reducing employment.
@MAKeliher Let's say Amazon has 100 employees, all working themselves to tears, as we've read in the news. They don't launch a Blue Apron competitor...
@MAKeliher I know. But Amazon's threat to Blue Apron has more to do with paranoia than practicality. Being public makes the paranoia hurt - measurably.
@MAKeliher I'd argue being publicly traded is more of a threat to Blue Apron than Amazon. But also: killing companies isn't the same as killing jobs.
@MAKeliher Fair enough. Carry on. :)

@JimmyA_Shook1s @AndyOplas Got it. You seem to know him very well. Let’s just give up and treat everyone like shit then. Solid solution.
@JimmyA_Shook1s @AndyOplas Even if we assume that to be true, what are the odds of changing that if we treat him like shit?
@JimmyA_Shook1s @AndyOplas His ideas don't hold water (for me), but that doesn’t mean he doesn’t deserve to be treated like a decent person.
@AndyOplas Separately, high-five for discussing this like an actual human. It’s pitiful that that’s even a notable accomplishment! :)
@AndyOplas @daveweigel Yes. At the *very least*, that much is clear.
@AndyOplas @daveweigel Halting an influx of refugees is a significantly different action than rounding up an entire race of people.
@AndyOplas @daveweigel I don’t agree with the halting, but it’s not outrageous. But justifying it by pointing to internment camps is.
@AndyOplas @daveweigel I acknowledge that it’s easy for me to say that today, but it’s really, really hard to envision justifying internment
@AndyOplas @daveweigel Like existential threats to democracy and freedom? I get the point about safety, but it hardly seems worth it.
@AndyOplas @daveweigel It’s nearly impossible for me to conceive of a way in which that’s true.
@daveweigel Is he acknowledging the whole internment camp thing and going “Yep, that was the right approach”?
