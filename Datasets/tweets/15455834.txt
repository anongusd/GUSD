Former #Bears GM Phil Emery probably cracked a smile this morning. Two of his 2014 draft picks, CB Kyle Fuller and LT Charles Leno, will be in the Pro Bowl. It's easy to forget Leno was a 7th round pick that year.

Halftime at US Bank Stadium with #Bears ahead 13-3. Be interesting to see how Matt Nagy plays it in 2nd half. Does he want to give it his best shot to finish off #Vikings right here?
#Vikings K Dan Bailey 45 yd FG attempt from left hashmark is good. #Bears lead 13-3, :53 remaining 2nd qtr
#Rams with another TD so #Bears look to be out of it when it comes to 2-seed.
Boo birds are out in force at US Bank Stadium. #Vikings fans getting very nervous.
Snap was a little bit high but Parkey has had too many misses. Parkey now 42 for 45 on extra points this season.
#Bears Cody Parkey hits right upright and misses extra point. 13-0
#Bears Jordan Howard 1 yd TD run
Offense coming on the field so looks like Taylor Gabriel will be ruled down at the 1 yd line.
Nick Mullens has throw his 3rd INT and this was Pick 6 as #Rams go up 20-3, extra point pending.
40-yard touchdown to Taylor Gabriel. Great throw and catch.
#Vikings punted from their own 3 yd line and #Bears will begin this possession on their own 15. That's a field flip of 82 yards with the punt, loss on the return and unsportsmanlike conduct penalty.
#Vikings have been hoping to run the ball to open up play action but they are getting dominated in the trenches.
Referee Clete Blakeman rules Cousins was not in the end zone. No safety.
Holding call ... have to see if this is a safety.

#Rams have moved ahead of #49ers 14-0
#Bears WR Anthony Miller has a left shoulder injury. He is questionable to return.
Jordan Howard 5 yd TD run
The 42-yd run by Jordan Howard was his longest of the season and team's longest. Previous long was 25 for Howard and long for team was Mitch Trubisky (39).
#Rams score a TD to go up on #49ers
As expected, #Bears have promoted RG Kyle Long to the 53-man roster from injured reserve. Third QB Tyler Bray placed on waivers to make room. Long is expected to play Sunday vs #Vikings and wouldn't be a surprise if he starts.

It wasn't real pretty this afternoon but an injury-riddled San Francisco team has been tough in December. #Bears will leave with a 14-9 victory,  improve to 11-4. Remain a game behind #Rams for No. 2 seed after LA rolled AZ.
Mullens had 10-15 yards to run there and could have gone out of bounds ... and he threw it out of bounds.
If Allen Robinson goes down on that last catch, it's kneel down situation for #Bears
Allen Robinson fumbles and #49ers have new life. No review for this one.
Big catch there for Allen Robinson and #49ers use their final timeout. 3:14 remaining and #Bears nearing midfield.
QB sneak and #Bears move the chains.
Referee Alex Kemp says ruling on the field stands. 4th and 1 here and offense remains on field
#Bears coach Matt Nagy challenging spot for TE Adam Shaheen here. Looked like he might have reached line to gain.
Referee Alex Kemp announces holding on #Bears Charles Leno, personal foul #49ers S Marcell Harris. Personal fouls on Richard Sherman, #Bears WR Anthony Miller and Josh Bellamy. Sherman, Miller and Bellamy all ejected.
#49ers CB Richard Sherman is heading for the locker room.
Maybe officials are waiting for New York to tell them what their next move is here ...
Fracas along #Bears sideline after Mitch Trubisky is hit post slide. We'll see how this gets sorted out. Looked like Richard Sherman was swinging.
That is the 27th INT on season for #Bears D and Trevathan becomes the sixth defender with at least 2 picks. Opponents have 21 TD passes. Amazing statistic.
Danny Trevathan picks off ball that goes through the hands of #49ers WR Marquise Goodwin. Trevathan was sizing up Goodwin for the hit and got the ball instead.
#Bears have been stout in red zone so far today. See what happens here.
Heading into the 4th qtr at Levi's Stadium, #Bears lead 14-9 and they've moved into SF territory.
#49ers blew blocking assignment there but boy does Roquan Smith close on the QB quickly

#Bears WR Allen Robinson fumbles and #49ers are in business here
#Bears DE Akiem Hicks shaken up after that play.
#49ers Breida, Pettis, Celek all ruled out for remainder of the game.
@ChefSpencer68 Well, the TD did come after a call negated a pick on the end zone for SF ...
@cubgolfer22 They were about to spike the ball b/c officials ruled 1st down. The FG team was about to run on the field.
#49ers Robbie Gould 23 yd FG is good and San Francisco leads 9-7 at halftime.

Terrible decision to throw that ball. Trubisky saved by holding call on LB Fred Warner.

Allen Robinson coming on the field to begin this possession for #Bears
#49ers Robbie Gould 30 yd FG attempt from right hashmark is good, San Francisco leads 6-0, 5:49 remaining 2nd qtr. #Bears D did well to stand there after turnover.
#49ers announce WR Dante Pettis has a knee injury and TE Garrett Celek being evaluated for a head injury. No word yet on Robinson.
So he's saying it's been a while ... https://t.co/VHKhXNWLPF

Officials pick up the flag on Sherrick McManis there. No PI.
#Bears medical staff huddled on sidelined no doubt discussing status of WR Allen Robinson. Team has yet to announce anything regarding him.
1st quarter ends at Levi's Stadium with no score. Chain gang is on the field and #49ers picked up 1st down on that last run.

To have 5 Pro Bowl sections and 7 alternates is a testament to how far #Bears have come and how coaches have brought our best in many of these players acquired by front office. Has to be a proud night at Halas Hall.
#Bears also have 7 Pro Bowl alternates - LT Charles Leno, C Cody Whitehair, QB Mitch Trubisky, TE Trey Burton, ILBs Danny Trevathan and Roquan Smith and OLB Leonard Floyd.
#Bears have 5 players selected to Pro Bowl - OLB Khalil Mack, DL Akiem Hicks, FS Eddie Jackson, CB Kyle Fuller and returner Tarik Cohen. Good haul for them.
Pro Bowl rosters will be announced at 7 pm on NFL Network. #Bears should be well represented. Best guess is 5 players have their name called - Akiem Hicks, Khalil Mack, Kyle Fuller, Eddie Jackson &amp; Tarik Cohen.

24 seconds left and I am surprised they are not kicking a FG here
#Packers have to consider a field goal soon as they're down 10 and out of timeouts ... going to need onside kick and a 2nd possession

Huge return for Tarik Cohen and #Bears are 1st-and-goal from the 15 yd line with a chance to go up 2 scores. 44-yard punt return.
#Bears lead 21-14, 10:16 remaining at Soldier Field.
#Bears take the lead on Mitch Trubisky's 13 yd TD pass to Trey Burton.
Direct snap to Tarik Cohen for a fumble and turnover. That's a bad gadget play.
#Bears OLB Aaron Lynch out for remainder of game with an elbow injury. Looked like the right elbow.
Rodgers pass to Adams and game is tied at 14 with 4:10 remaining 3rd qtr. So much for the fake punt.
Jamaal Williams 10 yd TD run and #Packers will go for 2 and the tie
#Bears can roll the dice with fake punt because of their defense. I'd like the call a little better when it's not quite as predictable (short distance to gain, midfield).

#Bears have promoted QB Tyler Bray from the practice squad to back up Chase Daniel, as expected. CB Marcus Cooper was released to make room.		Also, TE Adam Shaheen &amp; OLB Aaron Lynch (both have concussions) did not travel to Detroit. So they are out tomorrow.

#Bears DC Vic Fangio on last night‚Äôs Monday Night Football offensive explosion: ‚ÄúIts not what I like to see as a connoisseur.‚Äù
Asked who is starting at QB, #Bears defensive coordinator Vic Fangio said ‚ÄúStafford.‚Äù So we‚Äôve got that part settled.
#Bears are not holding a practice today, they will have a walk-through on the short week. That is typical of week with a Thursday game. So Chase Daniel isn't "practicing" per se today with Trubisky dealing with shoulder. Nagy confident veteran backup can handle role if needed.
Nagy rules out surgery as something Mitch Trubisky will need for his right shoulder. So there's a positive.
Nagy: "We feel very confident" it's not a long-term injury.
Nagy: "I'm not going to get into the actual details of everything on his shoulder."
Nagy: "He wants to play, I know that. We've got to make sure in these things we do the right thing." He says he is "cautiously optimistic" but reiterates Trubisky is day-to-day.
Nagy says he doesn't expect Trubisky will practice today. Said injury was incurred on the late hit by #Vikings S Harrison Smith.
Nagy: "This to me is going to be similar cautiously the same way as Khalil (Mack) and Allen (Robinson). He's in pain, which is normal. But for us, again, this has been a short day-and-a-half for us."
#Bears coach Matt Nagy: "He has a right shoulder that we're dealing with right now and it's something that is going to be day--to-day for us" on QB Mitch Trubisky.

@HunterT2929 No, I'm not looking at it like that and a tee is not permissible in the NFL on a fair catch kick.

Long putting no weight on right foot as he gets help off the field. Looks like it could be serious.
#Bears RG Kyle Long shaken up after the last play
Jordan Howard 2 yd TD run to cap a nice drive.

Another 4th and 1 choice for Matt Nagy as 3rd quarter comes to an end. 4th and 2 from the 14 or a 32-yd FG?
Trubisky keeper left and he moves the chains.

Pregame forecast is for winds 20 to 30 mph and that could affect passing game for #Bears #Jets today more than possibility of rain.
#Bears rookie OLB Kylie Fitts is active for the first time this season with Khalil Mack out.
#Bears OLB Khalil Mack and WR Allen Robinson are OUT
Mack is headed back to the locker room. He played catch (and showed off a pretty nice arm) and jogged a little. That was about it.
It would be a stretch to say Mack has done anything yet that would constitute testing his ankle out to see if he can play today. With no one overseeing his game of catch with Bradley Sowell, have to think #Bears already have a decision one way or the other.
Mack stretching but there have not been any coaches or athletic training staff surveying his work. Inactives must be turned in at 10:30, in a little more than 20 minutes.
#Bears OLB Khalil Mack just came out on to the field. Doing some light jogging.
#Bears TE Adam Shaheen working out pregame on the field. He still looks a little hobbled.

#Bears open as a 6-point favorite over #Jets for next Sunday's game at Soldier Field at Westgate SuperBook in Las Vegas according to my guy @JoeFortenbaugh.
Play is under review.
Kevin White catches Hail Mary at the 1 yd line but doesn't get in and game ends. #Patriots 38-31 victory.
#Patriots call timeout with 30 seconds remaining. 4th and 6 at #Bears 33. New England will punt or line up to punt.
#Patriots lead 38-31, 4:13 remaining. Both teams have 3 timeouts.
Trubisky to Burton 11 yd TD and #Bears have made this interesting
#Bears TE Trey Burton has topped 100 yards for the first time this season
Kevin White's first catch of the season
#Bears CB Kyle Fuller with his 3rd pick in 2 games.
James White 2 yd TD run.
More lousy tackling by #Bears secondary
Great play by Jones. If the ball leads Miller, it might be a TD there.
Trubisky picked off again. Hell of a play by Jonathan Jones.
JC Jackson interception and #Patriots take over. Have to see if it was a good catch
Blocked punt for #Patriots and a TD
Stephen Gostkowski 29 yd FG and it's tied at 24 with 7:48 remaining 3rd qtr
Roquan Smith well timed blitz sacks Tom Brady and #Patriots will kick FG
#Bears QB Mitch Trubisky has 81 yards rushing on 6 carries, the most rushing yards by a CHI quarterback since Cade McCown had 87 in season opening 30-27 loss to #Vikings on Sept. 3, 2000.

2 QBs on the field
#Bears convert and are now in business at NE 13
4th and 4 from NE 30 and #Bears will go for it
Referee Clay Martin announces play calls as stands. #Bears ball at NE 36 with 10-7 lead.
#Patriots RB Sonny Michel appears to be in considerable pain. Looks like he might have been down before losing the ball.
Another fumble and #Bears have the ball
Mitch Trubisky with an 8-yard TD run that he can about 48 yards to achieve.
Cordarrelle Patterson fumbles on KO return and #Bears recover. Nick Kwiatkoski forced fumble and DeAndre Houston-Carson recovered.
#Bears Cody Parkey 46 yd FG attempt from left hashmark is good
Three missed tackles on Julian Edelman's 9-yard TD reception. New England strikes first with 75-yard, 8-play drive that consumed 4:00.
#Bears win coin toss and defer so #Patriots ball to start
OLB Khalil Mack, WR Allen Robinson &amp; CB Bryce Callahan all active for #Bears. #Patriots TE Rob Gronkowski (back) is out.
Callahan didn't work out for too long. Headed back in now. Will be interesting to see what happens with him. Inactives must be turned in 90 minutes prior to kickoff - so in about 23 minutes.
#Bears nickel CB Bryce Callahan (questionable, ankle) is working out on the field with athletic trainer Andre Tucker, DB coach Ed Donatell and GM Ryan Pace among those looking on.
#Bears OLB Khalil Mack doing some stretching and light work on the field pregame. He's questionable with a right ankle injury but with a consecutive games played streak of 69 and counting, he's almost certain to play. TE Adam Shaheen also out for pregame work again this week.
ICYMI: With right hand nearly fully healed, rush is on for #Bears OLB Leonard Floyd to be more productive. He's got 0 sacks and just 1 QB hit through 5 games. https://t.co/uIPXUvPYGO

#Bears OLB Leonard Floyd was fined $10,026 for unnecessary roughness stemming from body slam of #Dolphins WR Danny Amendola last week. Then he was fined $20,054 for roughing the passer call against Brock Osweiler. That's $30,080 total.

#Bears OLB Khalil Mack was held out of practice again Thursday with ankle injury. Given he has not missed a game in his NFL career (69 consecutive games) and finished the game at Miami (62 of 78 snaps), my instinct is it will take more than this to sideline him Sunday vs NE.

Cody Parkey will have a kick to win it

#Dolphins win coin toss and elect to receive.
#Bears head to OT for first time since Week 6 of last season at Baltimore.
#Bears will kneel it down and play for OT
Smart to punt out of end zone here
4th and 6 on #Bears 41 yd line with 41 seconds remaining. Matt Nagy calls timeout and #Dolphins have punt team on field
Tarik Cohen coughs the ball up and #Dolphins recover
Sanders knocks through the extra point and it's 28-28 in Miami with 3:01 remaining.
And just like that Albert Wilson scores on a 75 yd TD.
#Bears lead 28-21, 3:17 remaining.
Busted coverage as Anthony Miller scores 29 yd TD. No one ran with him on 3rd and 9.
Mitch probably should have been picked off in the red zone again.
#Bears CB Prince Amukamara is doubtful to return with a hamstring injury. Worth wondering if another week of rest would have been wise.
#Dolphins 2 pt conversion: Pass to Kenny Stills is good. Game is tied 21-21, 9:08 remaining
Albert Wilson weaves 43 yards for TD on 3rd and 6 and #Dolphins will go for 2 pt conversion and tie
Mitch picked in the end zone
Jason Sanders 25 yd FG and #Dolphins trim #Bears lead to 21-13, :25 remaining 3rd qtr
Tarik Cohen 21 yd TD run. He had tons of room to run and got a nice block from LT Charles Leno. #Bears push lead to 21-10.
#Bears pick on McTyer again. This time a 54 yd pass to Taylor Gabriel.
#Bears lead 14-7, 11:28 remaining 3rd qtr
Allen Robinson 12 yd TD catch from Mitch Trubisky
Fuller with another INT and #Bears are in red zone
#Dolphins DE Jonathan Woodard ruled out with a concussion.
Mitch Trubisky shovel pass to Trey Burton for 9 yd TD. Quick strike on opening drive of 3rd qtr for #Bears
Interesting that Benny Cunningham gets the carry on final play of 1st half after the Jordan Howard fumble.
That is the 9th interception of the season for #Bears, eclipsing their total for entire season in 2017.
Kyle Fuller INT
Jordan Howard fumbled at goalline and #Dolphins recover
Really nice catch by Taylor Gabriel on a deep ball from Mitch Trubisky. They seem intent in going after #Dolphins CB Torry McTyer
#Bears OLB Khalil Mack is on the field. Looks like a significant tape job on his right ankle. Miami will begin possession on its own 17 yd line, 8:41 remaining 2nd qtr
Brock Osweiler 5 yd TD pass to Nick O'Leary and #Dolphins strike first
Bad penalty there for Leonard Floyd. Body slam not the recommended form.
Eric Kush starting at LG for #Bears
#Bears have had an opening drive touchdown in 3 of 4 games. 90 yards to go for one here.
#Bears win coin toss and defer so #Dolphins and Brock Osweiler will get the ball 1st
The #Dolphins Ryan Tannehill/Brock Osweiler news moved #Bears to a 7-point favorite. This marks first time they have been favored by a TD &amp; extra point favorite on the road since Dec. 23, 2012 at Arizona. Bears defeated Cardinals 28-13 that day.
Eric Kush lined up next to Cody Whitehair as #Bears O-line takes first reps in warmups in corner of end zone. Could be a rotation at LG again today with James Daniels.
#Bears inactives: CB Marcus Cooper, FB Michael Burton, OLB Kylie Fitts, OL Rashaad Coward &amp; Bryan Witzmann, WR Javon Wims and DT Nick Williams.

#Bears DE Akiem Hicks just ejected for pushing an official. Have to wonder if a fine or possible suspension follows.
#Bucs TE OJ Howard (knee) is questionable to return
Interception for Eddie Jackson. That is #Bears 6th pick of the season. They had 8 all last season. And 8 in 2016. And 8 in 2015.
Last time #Bears scored 35 points in the 1st half was 41-10 victory over #49ers on Oct. 29, 2006, when they hung all 41 points on SF in the first half.

That's another one and that's a TD. Rout is in full progress.
I don't know if TV shows it real well but that is about 4th time #Bears have had totally wide open - uncovered - target
James Daniels in at left guard for this possession.
#Bears sack for Khalil Mack with another strip. #Bucs recover but they will punt. D is just swarming and worth wondering if Tampa goes to the bullpen for Jameis Winston here soon.

Sack ends this game. #Bears win and go to 2-1.
Offside on Khalil Mack will negate that play
Eddie Jackson pick 6 but there is a flag
4th and 5 and Bryce Callahan picks off Josh Rosen. Ball floated right to him.
Super play by Bilal Nichols for a stuff in backfield. It's 4th down.
#Cardinals K Phil Dawson is 43 years old. He hit a career-long 57-yarder last season.
State Farm Stadium crowd is definitely hyped to see Josh Rosen. Certainly cannot blame them.
#Cardinals coach Steve Wilks will go to the bullpen. He's calling in 1st rd pick Josh Rosen.
Nagy has now used a timeout twice to pull offense off the field and send Parkey on. At any rate, #Bears lead 16-14 with 4:31 remaining and Sam Bradford has looked jittery all game.
43-yd FG attempt by Cody Parkey from right hashmark is good and #Bears lead
Now Cody Parkey is on the field.
Now Matt Nagy calls his 2nd timeout of the half. 4:34 to play.
Offense staying on the field for 4th and 1. #Bears trail by 1 with less than 5 min to play
#Bears look to be just short here.
Huge play for Khalil Mack and #Bears D there
Kevin Toliver caught flat footed there
We head to the 4th qtr at State Farm Stadium with #Cardinals clinging to 14-13 lead.
#Cardinals have 128 yards offense. 30 of that came on blown coverage throw to Christian Kirk on opening possession. 35 of that came on blown coverage on Ricky Seals-Jones TD. In other words, AZ offense going nowhere.
Cody Parkey 41 yd FG from left hashmark is good
Trainer just took Miller's helmet
#Bears WR Anthony Miller banged up again with trainer once again holding his left arm.
Offsides on #Cardinals bails out Trubisky on a bad throw
#Bears CB Prince Amukamara doubtful to return with a hamstring injury.
Sherrick McManis with the INT for #Bears. Spectacular diving play to set up offense on AZ 44 yd line.
#Cardinals lead 14-10, 6:16 remaining 3rd qtr
Jordan Howard powers his way in from 1 yd out for #Bears, who are doing just fine with ground game.
Measurement confirms they picked it up on shovel pass to Robinson
After timeout, #Bears will still choose to go for it
4th and 1 and #Bears will go for it at AZ 19
Eddie Jackson comes a long way to make a pick.
Really fine play by Sherrick McManis. He doesn't seem to slow down with age on special teams.
#Cardinals will now punt and if they're smart they will punt out of the end zone
Huge sack for #Bears to maybe knock AZ out of FG range. Khalil Mack lined up on right that time.
#Cardinals INT
#Cardinals calling 3 straight pass plays there is not what I would have guessed prior to start of possession.
That was interesting. Cody Parkey's 20 yd FG is good. #Cardinals 14-3, 1:54 remaining 2nd qtr
#Bears sending FG team on to the field.
Offense remains on the field after the timeout ...

Former #Bears CB Cre'Von LeBlanc has been signed to #Lions practice squad. Chicago was one of six teams to offer him a PS spot, I am told. Depth chart most appealing in Detroit.
#Bears are expected to sign DB Jonathon Mincy to practice squad.
#Bears have yet to announce their practice squad signings. We know of 3 - Ryan Nall, Tanner Gentry &amp; Josh Woods. The minimum salary for PS in 2018 is $7600 per week, which would be $129,200 for entire 17-week regular season.
So #Bears have cleared 2 roster spots today with TE Adam Shaheen and C Hroniss Grasu and filled one of them with DL Nick Williams.
#Bears GM Ryan Pace says TE Adam Shaheen will be placed on injured reserve. Hope is he can return.
Nagy on likelihood of Mack playing next Sunday at Green Bay: "Hopefully pretty good."
Khalil Mack had 5.5 sacks in 8 games against #Chiefs when Matt Nagy was working in Kansas City over the last four seasons.
Mack: "I want to be great. I want to be known as one of the best to play the game. That's what it's all about."
Mack on if there is pressure being NFL's highest-paid defensive player: "I'd be lying if I told you there wasn't. I want to be able to go out and show why."
Mack if he could be missing piece: "You could see a lot of different things. Until I go out and play, I'm not a big talker. When I go out and get on the field, you can probably sense what is going to happen."
#Bears OLB Khalil Mack: "To be wanted, that's all it takes."

#Bears are expected to re-sign RB Ryan Nall to the practice squad.

#Bears are bringing back WR Tanner Gentry on the practice squad.
#Bears expected to sign OLB Josh Woods to practice squad.
#Bears only have 5 defensive linemen on roster. I'd expect them to add a 6th, perhaps tomorrow. They will need to clear a roster space for OLB Khalil Mack. Also, would not be surprised if they survey cornerback market. TE Adam Shaheen could be candidate for IR w/ goal to return.

Sam Acho played on minimum salary deals the last 3 seasons with #Bears so getting a guarantee as his brother says is happening is a sign the team has plans for him to be bigger part of defense this year than he was in offseason past couple years.

@Lylemack23 My hunch is Sims is back. Definitely see them paying Long &amp; Massie.
@totemoTHFC He's not going anywhere
#Bears have $$$ decisions tied to Friday:		TE Dion Sims $4M of $6M base salary becomes fully guaranteed	CB Marcus Cooper $2M of $5M base salary becomes fully G	QB Mike Glennon $2.5M roster bonus fully G	RT Bobby Massie $1M roster bonus	RG Kyle Long $5M roster bonus

@LlwynLlwyfenni In his defense, he had only 101 special teams snaps because they needed him as a WR. In 2016, he had 274. He's still a solid player on teams.

Former #Bears RB Matt Forte has announced his retirement from the NFL. He was outstanding for a long stretch in Chicago.
Asked about how #Eagles coach Doug Peterson was very aggressive on 4th downs and 2-point conversions, new #Bears coach Matt Nagy said, ‚ÄúI like it. I like it.‚Äù
The release of OLB Willie Young later today will make RG Kyle Long, 29, the oldest player on #Bears roster.
Releasing Willie Young and Mike Glennon will leave #Bears with 45 players under contract for 2018. That's the lowest figure in the NFL. The league average, according to @spotrac, is 57.7.
@TonyTram75 @MJMcElwee @ChicagoBears It will be 3/14
So the #Bears plan is to terminate the contract of Mike Glennon after the start of the new league year. It's a bookkeeping matter and likely happens March 14. He has fully guaranteed roster bonus on March 16.
Pace says roster decisions still being determined when it comes to guys like Markus Wheaton and Marcus Cooper.
#Bears will terminate contract of OLB Willie Young today.
Ryan Pace says #Bears cannot release Mike Glennon until the start of the new league year. So look for that to happen perhaps after he receives fully guaranteed $2.5M roster bonus on March 16.
Pace says #Bears are still evaluating what to do with CB Kyle Fuller.

@PhinsiderRadio That's not how I submitted it to the desk and that is why I was taken aback. I wouldn't be surprised if he is released but I also would not term it "likely," Mike Glennon being released would be likely. Sims? I wouldn't go that strong.

#Eagles need to play some serious keep away here. Need the poise to run play clock down before the snap.
#Eagles 29, #Patriots 26 as we head to the 4th qtr. One of the wildest and certainly the most wide-open Super Bowl there's been. 962 yards offense so far, a Super Bowl record with 15 minutes to play. Buckle in.
#Patriots QB Tom Brady with 403 yards passing so far.  His 466 in Super Bowl LI last year, which went to OT, stands as the Super Bowl record. There is 3:23 remaining 3rd qtr.
Now 625 yards of offense in #SBLII and three missed kicks.
#Patriots and #Eagles have combined for 555 yards offense in #SBLII and there is 2:04 remaining 2nd qtr.

@garykern69 That's what the Bears paid him in 2016.
@garykern69 Yeah, the $14.6 million he got his last year was a real slap in the face.
#Eagles WR Alshon Jeffery with 3 catches for 73 yards and 1 TD so far. 15-3 Philly lead, 8:48 remaining 2nd qtr.
Amending my previous note on crowd distribution: It's not close. #Eagles fans much larger presence at U.S. Bank Stadium. It's not even close.
One hour from kickoff seems like #Eagles fans have a stronger presence. That's certainly understandable from standpoint that it would be expensive for average #Patriots fan to travel to and attend Super Bowl say 8 times since 2001.
Close game coming in #SBLII? Here are point differences in #Patriots Super Bowls under Bill Belichick:		Wins: 3, 3, 3, 4, 6 (OT) 	Losses: 3, 4

#Vikings kneeling down and this is going to do it for the 2017 version of #Bears football. 23-10 loss. They will finish 5-11, 4th consecutive year in last place in NFC North.
4th and goal from the 2-yard line: #Bears turn the ball over on downs. The ol' shovel pass doesn't work.
Down 13 with less than 4 minutes to play, little more sense of urgency with clock required.

John Fox will go for it on 4th and goal from 6 with 11:29 remaining and #Bears trailing 23-7
Stefon Diggs 15 yd TD reception from Case Keenum. #Vikings now lead 23-7, :14 remaining 3rd qtr.
Kai Forbath 55 yd FG attempt on final play of first half from right hashmark is wide right. #Vikings lead 16-7.
Call on the field is confirmed. Safety stands.
#Vikings lead 16-7, 2:25 remaining 2nd qtr and they're going to get the ball on a free kick now.
That's a safety. Intentional ground on Mitch Trubisky.
Not exactly like the Johnny Knox fake play that Dave Toub created for #Bears. In this instance, Callahan blended in along sideline. Similar concept. Great play.
Tarik Cohen faked like he was going to receive the punt and Callahan scored easily with a nice block from Christian Jones.
Bryce Callahan punt return TD. Great play.
#Vikings Latavius Murray with another 1-yard TD run. That's 72 yards in penalties vs #Bears now if you are keeping track at home.
That's consecutive 3-and-outs for #Bears offense.
#Vikings lead 7-0, 9:07 remaining 1st qtr
#Vikings strike first as Latavius Murray scores on a 1-yard run.
ICYMI: A job interview is a 2-way street. Here are 10 questions #Bears will have to answer for potential head coaching candidates: https://t.co/VxSjKYtkqv
In last 2 weeks, multiple folks have mentioned #Packers as logical landing spot for #Bears DC Vic Fangio. Know this much: Fangio will have options with his contract expiring. https://t.co/BWRPn5H2SH
@nrarmour Thanks, Nancy! Happy New Year.
A job interview is a 2-way street. Here are 10 questions #Bears will have to answer for potential head coaching candidates: https://t.co/VxSjKYtkqv
@Nequestns OK. Go ahead and check out the other possibilities and then get back to me.
#Packers signing WR Davante Adams to a contract extension removes him from mix for free agency in March. Arguably would have been best available receiver on market.
@AllJay_AllNight @Rich_Campbell Wouldn't be practical with tiebreakers involving more than 2 teams. Doesn't take into account totality of season. Much better to look at overall strength of schedule.
@AllJay_AllNight @Rich_Campbell Because the tiebreaker is inverse strength of schedule.
@ChiefHawksFan That's not accurate.
@TraderjoeyG Here you go https://t.co/GH59dRP3sl
So that makes likely #Bears O-line for Sunday: LT Leno, LG Whitehair, C Grasu, RG Compton, RT Sowell.

#Bears coach John Fox with the challenge flag.
#Bears lead 13-3, 12:23 remaining 3rd qtr

#Bears promote OL Brandon Greene, an undrafted rookie free agent from Alabama, to the 53-man roster from the practice squad. S Chris Prosinski, who suffered a concussion last week and was listed as questionable for Sunday's game vs #Browns, has been placed on injured reserve.

@NFLAgents_net I don't Sorry. Bears figure to land at least Jordan Howard after the natural attrition.
For the 3rd consecutive year, #Bears do not have a Pro Bowl player at official announcement of original rosters by NFL.

@SeeRedCHI23 That's not true and with that, we're done.
@SeeRedCHI23 No question that would be the goal. Maybe they strike gold. McVay is the exception, though, and I am sure you realize that. Another key difference? Rams had a playoff-ready D. Bears do not. Rams fans would tell you it's been hell waiting too. Lot of coaches last 10+ years.
@SeeRedCHI23 Deny what? I reported he wasn't good? Still not good in Miami. Have a great night.
@InnerGee_ktg I've been pretty clear here: None of it has been good. You don't get 3-9 after 3-13 with just a "terrible" coach to use your word. Reality is if and when they change coaches, it's still a rebuild.
@SeeRedCHI23 I'm not defending Fox at all. Maybe re-read what I wrote.
@SeeRedCHI23 No one is arguing his job future here. Remember back when people figured replacing Trestman was all it was going to take to put the Bears back on the right path? Just keep in mind it's not always as simple as it looks. That's all.
@SeeRedCHI23 It's not the roster? You lost me there. They're critically short on playmakers, period. I'd take what you're saying as a compliment to Fox, the whole they've lost close games part.
@SeeRedCHI23 If I was a fan, I would hope it was solely on the coach and the staff. That's an easier (not easy) fix. If it's the coach, his staff and the roster ... that's a long haul issue.
@SeeRedCHI23 I'm not backing Fox here at all. You and I apparently have a vastly different view of what the roster has looked like from 2015 to the present.
@InnerGee_ktg Goodwin was the best receiver on the field. Period.
@InnerGee_ktg SF receivers &gt; Bears and that's not even a discussion. I get it. You think the coach is terrible. Roster is problematic on both sides of the ball as well.
@InnerGee_ktg I agree with you. I don't believe the personnel for 2 3/4 seasons is such that another coach would be substantially better.
#Bears coach John Fox says team has chosen to defer when winning coin toss pregame because defense has been more "consistent" than offense this season.
#Bears NT Eddie Goldman (hip), OLB Pernell McPhee (shoulder) &amp; S Adrian Amos (hamstring) did not participate in practice today.
@InnerGee_ktg I didn't say he's done that. I was disputing your assertion he's a "terrible" coach. That's all. I'm not calling him great but he's way, way off from being "terrible."
@InnerGee_ktg Yeah, TOTALLY different game from 2002 to 2010. LOL.
@InnerGee_ktg Terrible coaches don't win 131 games and reach 2 Super Bowls. I'd submit the WR depth chart is more detrimental than anything the coach is doing too.
@tomverv8 Agree with you on on. Not the other.

The good news: #Bears LB Danny Trevathan (calf) was a full participant in practice. Also LG Josh Sitton (concussion) was limited.

#49ers QB Jimmy Garoppolo says he had #Bears jerseys as a kid -- Brian Urlacher &amp; Anthony Thomas. Says he's never been to a football game at Soldier Field before.
@eric_stickler I take it you've been a fan for about 2.5 years now.
There are certainly more nuanced ways to be critical of #Bears than taking John Fox quote out of context when he doesn't want to tip roster moves of any shape or size, in this instance claiming OLB Lamarr Houston to replace WR Tre McBride. Deal wasn't final til 3 pm.
#Bears have claimed OLB Lamarr Houston off waivers from #Texans. So they do indeed know what they‚Äôre doing with the roster spot.
@thepikey7 IR
With WR Josh Bellamy back from concussion, he will likely regain playing time. One option to promote could be S Deiondre' Hall from IR. He started practicing last week and Amos is injured.
Fox on releasing WE Tre McBride: "Just kind of churning the roster. We have a roster spot available. We don't know exactly what we're doing. We have some options."
#Bears coach John Fox on DT59: "I thought he looked good today. Anytime you have a starter out it can be problematic. We could potentially have him back this week."
#Bears S Adrian Amos (hamstring) was held out of practice as was LG Josh Sitton (concussion).
#Bears LB Danny Trevathan (calf) returned to practice for first time since before #Saints game and was limited.

#Bears ILB coach Glenn Pires did not travel w/ team to New Orleans because he was ill. So quality control asst. Sean Desai signaled in calls
Of course, that's if he's under contract to any team. Would have to imagine #Bears consider cutting ties soon.
With #Bears on bye this week and 8 games remaining, I believe Freeman will be suspended for only Week 1 of 2018 season.
Kind of makes you wonder how #Bears voted a guy coming off a PED suspension as a captain to begin with.
10-game suspension without pay will cost #Bears LB Jerrell Freeman $2,205,882 of his base salary, which is $3.75M this season.
Have to wonder if there is a place in culture GM Ryan Pace wants in locker room for players who fail league's PED test twice.
Christian Jones has been playing well and #Bears like future of Nick Kwiatkoski anyway.
Has to be disappointing for franchise when a captain is a 2-time offender on the league's PED policy.
Freeman was suspended 4 games for violating the same performance-enhancing drug policy last season.
Freeman will begin serving suspension immediately while on injured reserve.

Marshon Lattimore picks off Trubisky
Big return by Tarik Cohen and horse collar on Will Lutz, #Bears in business on #Saints 43 yd line. 1:28 remaining.
Also should mention #Bears are 8 for 17 on 3rd down and that is really impressive for rookie QB on the road.
#Bears D has been very good on 3rd down. #Saints have converted only 2 of 9.
Will Lutz 49 yd FG from left hash is good. #Saints lead 20-12, 1:35 remaining.
Nope, FG team is on
#Saints might go for it here, 4th and 3 from 31 yd line
#Bears hold on 3rd down. Will be a long field goal for Lutz.
Illegal formation penalty gave #Bears free timeout there. #Saints with 3rd and 5 from 33-yd line. Big play here. 1:44 remaining.
Ingram is NOT in the game
Incomplete on 4th down. #Saints will take over. #Bears do have 2 TO remaining. 1:51 left.
Amos just ripped it out there and then recovered. Great play.
Ingram fumbled again.
That was poor, poor coverage there on Ginn. In the area but doing nothing to prevent the reception.

TD call is confirmed. #Bears will go for 2 point conversion here.
Officials rule Cohen scored a TD on dive there.
Jordan Howard drops a possible TD
Trubisky with a 46 yard run. Shades of Bobby Douglass.
Bullard from behind knocked ball out. About the third big hit Ingram took on the play.
Ingram loses ball and #Bears recover. Huge play.
Sitton at center. Sowell at LG
Sowell in
Sowell has helmet on and Whitehair does not. So we might have center switch coming right here after kickoff. Cody has brace on rt arm.
Will Lutz 45 yd FG try from left hash is good, #Saints lead 17-6, 12:54 remaining
Ruling on the field stands. Brees' right hand was clearly coming forward.
#Bears are challenging that call. They think ball came out. Big review here.
With Hroniss Grasu inactive, I believe Bradley Sowell is the backup center
It's right elbow for Whitehair, who is talking to doctor.
#Bears C Cody Whitehair questionable to return from an elbow injury.
Zach Miller has a large cast on his left leg now. Remarkable how many serious injuries he has battled through with great attitude.
Connor Barth 43 yd FG attempt from left hash is good. #Saints lead 14-6, 5:42 remaining 3rd qtr
Cheffers rules incomplete pass. 4th down for #Bears
Now the TD catch is under review by ref Carl Cheffers
They are bringing the cart to help Miller off the field.
Looks like a left ankle or foot injury for Miller in replay. Pretty gruesome.

Last time #Bears won completing 4 or less passes was Dec. 6, 1981, 10-9 victory over #Vikings
We're at the 2 minute warning and #Bears will win this game with Mitch Trubisky completing 4 of 7 passes for 107 yards.
Hicks up and walking off. #Panthers face 3rd and 12
Akiem Hicks shaken up on play that Pernell McPhee sacked Cam Newton
Danny Trevathan with an INT. #Bears in good field position. They've completely dominated Cam Newton.
Four possessions for #Bears in second half. Four 3 and outs.
#Bears announce 54,401 in attendance
Benjamin was open and Newton threw it high. Catchable but that wasn't a good throw.
Christian McCaffrey being unable to field that punt the difference in roughly 25 yards in field position.
Poor punt took a hell of a roll for Pat O'Donnell. 66 yards flips the field.
#Panthers have run 60 offensive plays. #Bears have 21. An extended driver here could help put game away.
Make that 17-3 .... #Bears lead
We head to 4th qtr at Soldier Field with #Bears leading 14-3
Newton has to know his makeshift O-line cannot protect for that long against talented #Bears front
#Panthers RG Trai Turner shaken up on that last play
Cam Newton was too slow to do anything and gets stuffed short of the line. Bad execution. Iffy call. Needed 2 full yards there.
Riverboat Ron going for it on 4th and 2 from 25
#Bears with a 17-3 halftime lead
Big play for #Panthers but they ran out of time.
RT @ESPNStatsInfo: Via @EliasSports: Eddie Jackson (CHI) is the first player with multiple 75+ yard defensive TD in a single game
#Bears will get ball to open 3rd qtr. Not sure if that factored in John Fox choosing to kick from 1 foot line there on 4th down.
Connor Barth 19 yd FG is good and #Bears lead 17-3
#Bears will attempt field goal on 4th and 1 from 1-foot line.
Referee Walt Anderson rules Mitch Trubisky was down short of the goalline. #Bears face 4th and goal from 1.

#Bears Kyle Fuller (arm) questionable to return team announces. He is on the bench with his helmet so that looks like a positive sign.
Marcus Cooper was in at CB at end of that possession. #Bears checking out right hand of Kyle Fuller.
#Panthers Graham Gano 36 yd FG is good. #Bears lead 14-3, 3:18 remaining 2nd qtr
#Bears DL Roy Robertson-Harris suffered a hamstring injury. He is doubtful to return.
That's sack No. 4 right there.

Cam Newton has been quite inaccurate today.
Prince Amukamara deflected pass for Kelvin Benjamin and ball went high in the air for Eddie Jackson, making it an easy play. 76 yard return.
Eddie Jackson picks off deflected pass and he will score his 2nd TD today
Connor Barth 52 yd FG attempt from left hash is short. Hit the crossbar. Came out ugly.
#Panthers C Ryan Kalil (neck) questionable to return to game
#Bears will try a 52-yd field goal here on 4th and 16 from CAR 34. Needed to avoid the sack there.
Akiem Hicks 3rd sack for #Bears D
Carolina came into game expecting #Bears to blitz a lot. Can't ask TE Chris Manhertz to 1-on-1 block Leonard Floyd often.
Leonard Floyd with a sack, No. 2 of the day for defense.

#Bears Connor Barth will attempt a 40 yd FG to win this game from the left hash.
#Ravens go for strip and not tackle and Jordan Howard busts off a 53-yd run
#Ravens are irate with the spot of that out of bounds punt.
@JohnnyOGraddy Because they took the same course with Trestman, right?
Ed Hochuli flips the coin, the #Bears win the toss &amp; will take the ball first.
Free football coming from M&amp;T Bank Stadium.
#Ravens need one nice completion to maybe win this with a field goal. Baltimore has ball on its own 44 yd line and Justin Tucker has cannon
Jordan Howard ran out of bounds to stop clock and force #Bears to kick. Taking play advice from Marion Barber.
#Bears have 2 timeouts remaining and will begin on their own 25 with 1:37 remaining.
Time for #Bears OC Dowell Loggains to take the bubble wrap off Mitch Trubisky, who has attempted only 12 passes so far today.
#Ravens 2 point conversion to tie game: Flacco to Boyle and we are knotted at 24
Punt return for TD by #Ravens. Unreal. 77 yards.

#Bears 2-point try is a walk-in for Mitch Trubisky on a pitch from Zach Miller. Very creative. All tied at 17 with 12:24 remaining.
Mitch Trubisky's first TD pass is a should-have-been-INT for Andrew Sendejo that Zach Miller hauls in for a TD. Now 2 -pt conversion.
Long back after 1 play out.

Sam Bradford looks a little gimpy jogging to huddle. If he can't avoid the rush, wonder if #Vikings will go to the bullpen for Case Keenum.
We're not to halftime yet but #Bears will be able to say nearly everyone took turn making errors when they review game tomorrow. Win or lose
Akiem Hicks with nice pressure up the middle for the sack.
That should really be picked off.
@JakeFu_kerson13 Can't grab hold of the jersey at the point of attack and that's what he did.
That's 4 possessions into MIN territory and no points from those drives. Winning field position battle for sure.
That's pretty minor for offensive pass interference. And I think it's a call that needs to be made more often.
Jordan Howard TD will be wiped out by flag.
#Bears controlled ball for 11:26 in 1st qtr
That's the end of the 1st quarter with #Bears leading #Vikings 2-0 at Soldier Field
Safety, Leonard Floyd. Sam Bradford held the ball for an eternity.
Third #Bears possession to reach #Vikings territory. Third #Bears possession without points.
Sam Bradford looks like a QB who has missed 3 weeks of time. Rusty and chose wrong WR on last play. We'll see if #Bears can mount drive.
Hey, @Ruben7974 in the house for tonight's game. He's a wonderful guy and was a terrific player.
#Bears sent special teams on the field and then switched but couldn't get play off. That's poor.
