Freshman House Dem on Trump‚Äôs push for new funding for childhood cancer cures ‚¨áÔ∏è https://t.co/LRRFTyx69T
Republicans boo, AOC smiles when Trump says "We are alarmed by new calls to adopt socialism in our countries."
Some news: Trump and Chairman Kim will meet in Vietnam on Feb. 27 and 28.
Sen. Joe Manchin stood and applauded for Trump's call for a ban on late-term abortion. He appeared to be the only Dem to do so.
Rep. Ann Wagner shouts "Yes!" when Trump said his budget would include a plan for nationwide family leave
His new proposals tonight are calling for an unstated amount of funds towards eliminating HIV/AIDS and for $500 million over the next 10 years for childhood cancer research
Trump's getting a decent amount of bipartisan applause for this health care section, including for pre-existing conditions protections and for lowering drug pricing. These broad goals are easy for both sides to get behind, but the devil, as always, is in the details.
The House floor was probably the loudest it's been all night when Trump discussed the record-number of women serving in Congress, with House Democrats exchanging high-fives and fist pumps.
Kirsten Gillibrand pointed to Democrats, instructing them to clap when Trump discussed more women serving in Congress this year.
Democrats were split in who clapped when Trump said he would "never abolish our heroes from ICE."
Some boos, groans and laughter from the Democratic side of the chamber as Trump moves into the immigration portion of the speech
Republicans broke out into a chant of "U-S-A" when Trump declared the state of the union to be strong. "That sounds so good," he replied.
RonJohn *very* excited when Trump mentions the passage of Right to Try
Kristen Sinema, Tim Kaine Joe Manchin and Tom Carper are among the Democrats I've seen standing to applaud most frequently so far
Many Democrats politely clapped as Trump entered the chamber, but notable ones who did not include AOC, Pramila Jayapal and Ilhan Omar. Republicans, on the other side, are clapping and cheering.

Minnesota Rep. Dean Phillips is wearing a white jacket tonight, matching with the House Democratic women wearing white in honor of suffragettes. He's chatting on the House floor with Kellyanne Conway now.
"It is unacceptable that Americans pay vastly more than people in other countries for the exact same drugs, often made in the exact same place," Trump will say, per prepared remarks. "This is wrong, unfair, and together we can stop it."
