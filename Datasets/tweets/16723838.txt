@KevinMKruse @davidmweissman This really is too much. Do you always do this? Attack a certain group of people and then attack them again when they try to talk with you about why your comment hurt them? Hm.
@daviesmandel @KevinMKruse Thank you. His defensiveness was a surprise to me at first, but then again not. This platform does engender snarkiness. It's how we get attention. I just don't want to play that game. We need more rational, generous conversations.
@martinejoelle @KevinMKruse I think it's the only way out.
@stephenablack Thank you. I‚Äôm still telling stories. I have a book of essays coming out in September. And I‚Äôm drifting back to food storytelling for this reason.
@KevinMKruse But what professional sites are you wading that have 1000 words about food before they get to the recipe? That‚Äôs the aberration, to be sure. Don‚Äôt go to those places either.
I still think stories about food matter deeply. We would be better served by slowing down and reading the stories sometimes. https://t.co/rf8ng45h4E
@KevinMKruse Enjoy whatever food you make. Just don‚Äôt expect a food blogger to perform for you what you think you need in the moment. 		There‚Äôs nothing wrong with telling stories about food and how we feed each other.		Maybe try some respect.		-30-
@KevinMKruse But I would argue that in these times, we need stories and community more than ever. Slow down. Quit pissing on other people‚Äôs work publicly, then making a joke of it when people answer you, engendering others to do the same. Snark is what got us here.
@KevinMKruse There‚Äôs an easy answer. Don‚Äôt go to food blogs for recipes. Search the recipe databases for a quick recipe you can make fast, without having to bother why that recipe matters to someone. Make food. Leave the food blogs to people who love food and create community with it.
@KevinMKruse You write about history in great detail. We read. If people just want facts about history, they google it. If they want a personality showing them why those facts matter, with nuance and humor, they read historians. It‚Äôs the same with food.
@KevinMKruse The disdainful comments about stories is the reason I quit keeping that blog after 12 years. The internet has become transactional, fast, anonymous. I saw Trump‚Äôs election long before it happened from the kinds of comments like yours. Give it to me, now. Don‚Äôt make me read.
@KevinMKruse And then we started getting attention for our work. I got a book deal, then 3 cookbook deals with my husband who is a chef. That‚Äôs where we have legions of recipes for immediate perusal. We won awards for our work. It felt good. But I kept returning to stories.
@KevinMKruse I started a place to write in 2005 that turned out to be one of the first 100 food blogs in the world. We were writers and photographers first. For us, food is a way to gather people to the table, to understand other cultures, and to share joy. We were storytellers.
@KevinMKruse First of all, I like your work. That‚Äôs why I‚Äôm answering. Food blogs are not recipe sites. They never were. If you want a recipe and nothing else, there are dozens of them. And they have the money to have entire teams working on SEO, so they will probably be first in searches.

@TawnieO We‚Äôve never gotten into butter tarts here and I think that‚Äôs a shame.
@TawnieO Shortbread is pretty simple. The key is 2/3 gf flour of your choice and 1/3 rice flour. The original Scottish shortbread uses rice flour.
@paulajanekelly Oh I would love to see your great grandma‚Äôs recipe!
@jennyhan I love those two. Same basic recipe as Mexican wedding cookies, I think, but without the shower of powdered sugar.
@madelinemoy Oh thumbprint!

@jsampancake Oh I get it. Yes, I want to say, my life is so sad because I cannot have your canned crescent rolls. Or, if I did, I would have diarrhea in your bathroom! But I smile and move on.
@STEWest And then I did go to Green Friday, because I saw the long line and a lot of friends and thought, what the hell. Totally efficient. Got 2 Christmas presents each for the kids. Done in 45. It was a very Vashon experience.
@STEWest Well, you know Vashon. I don't know anyone who is going over town to buy anything. But Granny's is having its big Green Friday, with all the best stuff they have been saving for the past 3 months. I'm not even going to that. Just writing, hanging out with the kids. Lights.
@elisebauer It's so stark. Sell people the idea they need new versions of electronics or the latest game, then stand back and point when they try to buy it for less than full cost. Ugh.
I'm not shopping on Black Friday. We don't need things. I'm also not going to disparage people waiting in lines for Black Friday. When you're sold the capitalistic ideal that THINGS make you happy, and you're poor, of course you line up for 50% off sale to make your kids happy.
This will be on repeat in our house. https://t.co/I8ybk0KSVQ
@PreetBharara Thank goodness!
I agree. https://t.co/EZQ4e1mcy1

@STEWest I would have LOVED to be there!

@martinejoelle Yes please!
@mandersqb We still make these every year. https://t.co/Jn9686Z1Id
@AllisonCallis Yes! Once you know the technique, ther is no difference.
@mandersqb Gluten-free breads need a lot of starch and longer rising time.

@martinejoelle @Orangeline84 @ava @amandadeibert @emilybest @franklinleonard @jennyyangtv I am so honored. And I would love to be at that dinner! Can we cook together?
@GingerWhisky1 And if you don‚Äôt have sweet rice flour in the house, your favorite gf flour will do the trick.
@GingerWhisky1 Yep. Make a roux with sweet rice flour. It‚Äôs starchy and works well. It won‚Äôt form a ball, like gluten flour. Don‚Äôt expect that. Cook it up until it holds together and is starting to brown. Then, drop spoonfuls of it into hot stock, stirring. Soon, gravy.
Thankful for this today. https://t.co/9KzZFRpv4S

Happy Thanksgiving. https://t.co/ZiTk8rmRdd
@THEToughCookie Me too.
@robicellis @laragraychan I‚Äôve had swelling like that. If you‚Äôre not in pain, nothing else feels weird, and you had x-rays? Ice it and see what happens in the morning.
@THEToughCookie It‚Äôs so tiresome to listen to a moron.
@robicellis If it doesn‚Äôt hurt like hell, this is a regular doctor‚Äôs visit, not the ER. Everybody‚Äôs body swells differently. Do you have any other symptoms?

@domenicacooks @THEToughCookie I know. But that is, for me, the way out. If I think there are some people who are born bad, then there is nothing to do but find a way to identify and eliminate them! If it's a thousand bad choices and true pain that goes unnoticed, then maybe I can help.
@THEToughCookie @domenicacooks And ridicule never makes anything better. This is hard for me, because I want to ridicule so many people these days. But does it help? I don't think so.
@THEToughCookie But here's the thing. You know someone hurt him. A lot. And often.
@domenicacooks @THEToughCookie Are they? Born bad? I really don't believe that. I teach my kids that "bad" people are ones who made the wrong choices, all lifetime long. But born bad? I still believe in the basic goodness of newborns.

@AmyLSigmon we have a long way to go.
@Ashley_E_Reis exactly. They have no idea what women who finally find their rage can do.
Stop. If powerful men lose their jobs and careers and reputation because they systematically harassed women, then maybe other people will start paying attention. Quit protecting predatory men. Get your hands off my ass.
Asking women to stop complaining that men masturbate in front of them, use threats to make women have sex with them, and say "she wanted it -- you could tell from the skirt she was wearing" is LOATHSOME.
Fact is, this systemic use of power and sex is woven into our culture far too securely. Women have been asked to stay silent and put up with it. Boys will be boys! No. Train your boys to respect women.
How about "Has the 'Men quit thinking that you own women's bodies' movement gone too far?"
How about "Has the 'I don't want you to grab me and shove your tongue down my throat without my consent' movement gone too far?"
How about "Has the 'Troglodyte on the sidewalk, quit catcalling disgusting names at my daughter' movement gone too far?"
How about "Has the 'Hey Boss, quit sliding your hand up my thigh while we're in a meeting' movement gone too far?"
Clearly we need to change the name we use for this movement. How would it sound if the headlines were "Has the 'Hey JERK, Get Your Hand Off My Ass, you asshole!'" movement gone too far?"
I'm starting to see stories use this headline: "Has the #metoo movement gone too far?" For godssakes. This isn't a meme repeated too many times. This is a generation of women standing up for themselves and demanding the culture of ubiquitous sexual harassment be changed.
