So, I really would one day like to be more like Ms. Kayyem (minus the security credentials‚ÄîI‚Äôm good with my gig!). But I want other people to know journalists could do better and be better if they wanted to.
At reporters who refuse to figure out how to best interview a President who is a chronic liar (hint: letting him ramble gets some good soundbites but doesn‚Äôt actually force him to analyze his comments.
Ms. Kayyem (whom I do not know) is so thoughtful and organized in her argument and response‚Äîit reallly is breathtaking. I wish I could be more like that. But I am truly furious‚Äîat journalists who let racists and racism slide unchallenged, and crappy both-sides reporting.

@EatWithNia Yup. Me too. Cuban mom encouraged us NOT to speak Spanish at home. So I‚Äôm not bilingual and I regret it.
@francie_berens He is. And them he says he personally would like to see more assimilation. Lots of data shows that after a generation or two, Latinos no longer speak Spanish‚Äîthey‚Äôre overwhelmingly English dominant.

@sovereignann He was arrested Friday. So he‚Äôs not even making sense.
Spanish dominance goes down for 2nd and 3rd generation Latinos. 61% of Hispanic immigrants in the U.S. are Spanish dominant (32% are bilingual), it drops to 6% among second-generation Hispanics and to less than 1% among third or higher generation Hispanics. https://t.co/gfdOPhoGIc

@KrisColvin @speechboy71 Crowd is giant. I counted 3 of the Israelites‚Äîcould be five. Dozens and dozens of kids. Adults seem to be the group. This nearly 2hr long video is consistent with interview Nathan Phillips gave.
@KrisColvin @speechboy71 At one point the Israelites call one black kid the n-word. (Approx 1:18) Person from school group responds ‚ÄúWe got another one at home. He ain‚Äôt here‚Äù. Israelite responds: ‚Äúso who‚Äôs the racist?‚Äù
@KrisColvin @speechboy71 Yup. This matches the full video I‚Äôve seen. Interestingly‚Äîat 1:10 in the video‚Äîa grown man with the kids takes his sweatshirt and shirt off‚Äîand flails. who is he?

So yeah‚Äîthe Marquetti y Mendietas and O‚ÄôBriens don‚Äôt want him on our family tree. (And trust me, we have a very spotty family tree).
Alas‚Äîit was not to be. He ends his tenure failing at the main agenda he had‚Äîby expanding our nation‚Äôs debt. He also failed at his multiple opportunities to call our his party‚Äôs bigotry and overt racism (looking at you @SteveKingIA). His legacy is failure.  And cowardice.
Instead, I tell him, now that he‚Äôs aware he comes from a diverse family tree maybe he‚Äôll do a better representing the interests of a wider swath of diverse people. That, in fact, this information makes me more hopeful that he‚Äôll think about his legacy to a broader constituency.
He has just had his dna tested and I guess he‚Äôs been informed that we are related. He says he thinks that I might be mortified by this information. (Had he seen my Finding Your Roots segment on PBS he‚Äôd know I have some very sketchy cousins). I tell him, I am not mortified‚Äîat all
The Speaker eventually hops on the phone‚Äîand it‚Äôs him. He has a pretty recognizable voice. He is very friendly even though I tend to call him out on twitter. A lot. He informs me that we are in fact related. Cousins in some way. (I THINK thru my mom‚Äôs afro Cuban side).
@matteroffacttv doesn‚Äôt focus too much on political talking heads. They‚Äôre often, um, not super honest so we keep them to a minimum and report on actual people across the country. (It‚Äôs why out ratings are very good. No joke). Anyhoo. I take the call. But I think it‚Äôs a prank.
So: my @SpeakerRyan story this morning. Takes place this past summer. I was driving into work when I get a call from one of his staffers that he is trying to reach me. I assume this is a prank bc the few times I‚Äôve tried to book the Speaker for @matteroffacttv : crickets.

@Fdr1942 @NateSilver538 Slippery slope argument is bullsh*t. If corporations say they don‚Äôt support support racism and bigotry‚Äîthey should prove it. To their customers and their employees. If they hold their values dear‚Äîthen prove it.
