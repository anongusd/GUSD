I think it was the defining trait of the GOP from the minute he came on the scene. What's happening two years in is incredulous journalists and members of the political class finally accepting that, holy crap, it's really, really true. https://t.co/Nkc5vhV0gb
@jbarro @jonfavs a) I can't believe yer actually defending the tactic of twisting a side comment in a FAQ that was quickly withdrawn &amp; disavowed &amp; making it the face of the GND. b) Of course any radical reindustrialization would be disruptive, but framing this as a net sacrifice is just wrong.

@BNW_Ben @JesseJenkins @atrembath @mattyglesias I have elected, in the name of my sanity, not to pursue this on here. I'll just say: until y'all acknowledge the absolutely toxic behavior of a very large proportion of online nuclear enthusiasts, you'll keep hitting resistance and being (performing?) confused about it.
This helps explain why, as studies have repeatedly found, MOC overestimate the conservatism of voters. They spend all their time w/ rich people, who are invested (even the "liberal" ones) in the socioeconomic status quo. https://t.co/ggmcagbU7W
Oh, one other note: Dem elected officials absolutely rely on money from these folks. So they have to call them constantly, go to their events, flatter them, speak their language. Even MOC w/ the best of intentions are affected by this 1% CW eventually -- they swim in it.
He seemed genuinely shocked &amp; hurt by this. Now just think about allllll those other rich old white guys, in the corporate (&amp; philanthropy) board rooms, at Davos, at high-dollar lunches w/ their MOC. They're ALL this clueless. And they run our world!
And then Schultz wanders out of the 1% bubble, toting cliches that seem so obviously and uncontroversially true to him, and WHAM, runs into the real world. Wait, what, the center is not definitionally superior? High taxes aren't universally condemned? It's not Both Sides?
... where old white men sit around saying this stuff to one another, nodding gravely, coming to assume that it's just obvious, just what everyone thinks. I mean, didn't you read David Brooks' latest?
Schultz's ideas are not interesting (they are are the opposite) but as a phenomenon, I find him fascinating. I think about the life you must lead where you end up with these ideas ... all the golf courses, high-rise offices, and Davos-style gatherings ... https://t.co/O8RMTrBevt

@NickJanusch I didn't claim it was the most cost-effective way to reduce a ton of co2. It produces a range of health, comfort, and economic benefits. Getting more value from a unit input of energy improves overall economic efficiency, no?

IOW, a carbon tax to fund energy efficiency investments seems like something you'd want to do even if you didn't care at all about pollution or climate change.
A thought. Every public dollar invested in energy efficiency pays back more than $1 in benefits. So to the extent the revenue from a carbon tax is plowed back into efficiency, the tax wouldn't be a "cost" at all, but a driver of continuous improvement in economic performance.
@mattyglesias About 95% of what I see on this site is, "if libs were serious about climate they'd support nuclear." As a form of engagement in the issue of climate change, that is misinformed, glib, shallow, &amp; far more about tribal enmities than the climate itself. So I'll just keep scolding.
@mattyglesias d) the cost issues facing the dominant plant designs, e) the actual state of innovation on SMRs, f) the policies that might actually help nuclear power, g) the timeline for serious carbon cuts relative to the timeline of nuclear construction?
@mattyglesias What percentage of the people glibly dismissing climate activists as "unserious" on this website understand a) the history &amp; role of nuclear, b) the distinction b/t existing &amp; new nukes, c) the actual range of opinions on nuclear among climate types?
@badlin @jayrosen_nyu Bless you both.
"Nuclear" has become a way for people who hate the left &amp; whose identities are bound up in feeling superior to the left to acknowledge climate change &amp; the need for policy without admitting the left is correct about anything.
@kdrum Something tells me if the left had an equivalent event, it would get lots more attention.
@Green_Footballs 🙏
@DavidOAtkins @theprospect Thanks, and great piece! I wish the bearded white wonk brigade in the climate world even understood that they *have* a theory of change.

We live in a stupid fucking world.
So, if you're keeping score: 		An event celebrating lies, ethnonationalism, &amp; violence: eh, just a thing cons do for fun.		Calls for humane, progressive policy to improve the lives of ordinary people: utterly outrageous, unrealistic, politically discrediting.
In the real world: the left released a resolution calling for decarbonization &amp; universal health care and EVERYBODY FLIPPED OUT. Cons attacked it. Pundits attacked it. *A large proportion of the Dem Party* attacked it. Universal health care, like all the other countries do? Nuts!
Imagine Dem politician after Dem politician courting the lefties, competing to say the most outlandishly progressive things they can think of, indulging &amp; even amplifying the craziest and most extreme conspiracy theories.
Imagine, as unhinged lefty after unhinged lefty told outrageous lies &amp; mused openly about political violence, the media just chuckling indulgently, as it does toward CPAC. "Oh, look, it's the whole Dem establishment getting together to wallow in violent fantasies! Those scamps."
Imagine a left event featuring outlandish conspiracy theories, a constant stream of obvious lies, regular calls for violence against political opponents, &amp; the participation of dozens of known hucksters &amp; cons. Imagine the Dem establishment attending, encouraging, courting it.
Consider CPAC: the level of discussion, the character of the participants, and above all, how it is treated by the GOP &amp; the mainstream media. Imagine how many things would have to change for there to be anything equivalent on the left.

@mmildenberger Ha, yes, I saw that! But don't worry, once everyone on the left becomes a hermit monk who eats only home-grown bulgur, the right will drop this very-good-faith criticism.
And to be clear: we probably are doomed! But at the very least we should stop BSing one another about it. Waiting for bipartisan climate progress that can get past the filibuster = doom, ie, massive &amp; persistent suffering of millions across centuries. Say so!
As I said in my piece: if you're one of those people who believe that the only way to make progress is to beg a few marginal Republicans for cooperation, fine, but you should squarely acknowledge the implications. It means we're doomed. It is a counsel of doom.

@KennethSerg Maybe if we're more civil?
Why hasn't the wealthiest, most powerful country in the world taken the lead on solving the biggest problem in our species' history? Because Republicans. Everything else is a remainder. &lt;/fin&gt;
Republicans are engaged in a morally monstrous course of action that will contribute to the suffering of millions, for centuries. That sounds grandiose, but it is quite literally true. We might not be able to change it, but we shouldn't let its familiarity dull our horror at it.
People who acknowledge climate reality spend 95% of their time arguing among themselves about how to apportion the 5% of the blame left over. It often seems, in the process, like we lose sight of the bigger picture, namely: There are 2 parties. One's ready to act. One refuses.
Republican opposition to dealing with climate change is a choice, made anew each day by adult human beings who are perfectly capable of choosing otherwise. They can read. They have access to all the same knowledge. They are autonomous agents &amp; responsible for their choices.
But we should not fall into the habit, so common in US political commentary, of treating GOP opposition like some inanimate feature of the landscape, as though it just exists in nature, like a mountain or a chasm, &amp; it's up to the rest of us to deal with it.
The left is twisting itself into knots trying to imagine a serious solution that can get through the GOP gauntlet, &amp; (predictably) falling to infighting. The GOP has indeed made the problem all but insoluble and all proposals to address it "unrealistic." Only crappy options left.
A reminder: the reason climate policy is so difficult to pass in the US is that the GOP, alone among major developed-world parties, denies the existence of the problem and has steadfastly, in practice, opposed all serious solutions.

29. Sigh. Sorry y'all, didn't mean to make this so damn long. Especially knowing that it's futile, as the last 4352346 rounds of this same argument were. But I am what I am, so whaddya gonna do? &lt;/fin&gt;
28. Just, please, don't get climate tangled up in that. Don't reinforce the association between climate &amp; green lifestyles. That will only harm climate's political prospects. This is the most intense &amp; urgent collective action problem in our species history. Keep the focus there!
27. So, again, live however you want. As I've said a dozen times now, there are tons of reasons to ride bikes &amp; eat less meat that have nothing to do with climate. Exemplify &amp; advocate for clean, healthy living if that's your thing.
26. Everybody needs to be freaked out about climate change. Anything that raises barriers, that confuses or distracts or complicates the process of understanding &amp; grappling with the need for collective action, is bad in my book.
25. Climate is not like conventional environmental problems. The scale, speed, &amp; severity are of a completely different magnitude. One person's contribution is not a drop in a bucket, it's a drop in an ocean. ONLY rapid, large-scale collective action promises any hope.
24. My nightmare is that if NBC did a "climate week" today, it would look exactly like their "green week" of old -- a bunch of well-meaning but preachy &amp; annoying people nagging others to give up little things that make their daily lives easier. Ugh.
23. Showy behavioral displays might "inspire" other members of the tribe, by reinforcing tribal bonds, but it will only raise the barrier to entry to people outside the tribe. "If I speak up on climate, I'll also be expected to do X, Y, and Z ... so, meh, I just won't."
22. It seems to me that those attempting to connect climate advocacy &amp; personal behavior are working to *reinforce* the association with environmentalism, to make climate seem not like a policy problem but like a full identity w/ associated behaviors &amp; cultural commitments.
21. The WORST thing that could happen is Americans see climate as just another version of environmentalism -- a kinda well-meaning if annoying personal devotion to critters &amp; trees. That impression leads to catastrophic misunderstanding &amp; complacency.
20. Putting aside the class implications -- these lifestyle choices are largely available to, &amp; chosen by, the affluent, who nonetheless remain the highest emitters -- it just seems to me to replicate exactly the mistakes that have so diminished environmentalism.
19. Which brings us to the present dispute. People are saying that those who advocate for smart climate policy are obliged to engage in showy green lifestyle choices -- take vacations on trains, buy an electric car, put up solar panels.
18. I want for there to be space for people to engage with climate change as a policy matter *without* being forced to also sign onto a lifestyle or identity. This is why I came up with the term "climate hawk" -- to help create that space. https://t.co/aXQ22eyxYb
17. This seems disastrous to me. And -- the whole point of all this -- I really, really don't want to see the same thing happen on climate. I do not want climate subsumed into "environmental," taking on all the same cultural baggage &amp; associations. It'll just be another niche.
16. In US environmentalism, writ large, concerns about public &amp; ecosystem health, about public policy, come packaged with a lifestyle &amp; a bunch of behavioral &amp; cultural commitments. Personal virtue &amp; progressive policy have gotten hopelessly tangled.
15. That raises the barrier to entry. If I want clean water, am I going to speak up about pollution? Not if, in order to do so, I have to adopt a certain style of dress, listen to certain types of music, accept certain associations, *be a certain kind of person*. It's too much.
14. It seems pretty self-evidently true to me that the ubiquity of this social stereotype is bad for environmentalism &amp; environmental causes. It makes environmentalism seem like a full-fledged Identity, or a religion, a whole package of behaviors &amp; signifiers &amp; commitments.
13. You can argue whether the caricature is fair or deserved. You can argue about whose fault it is. But, unless you've lived entirely inside the green bubble from college forward, you can't deny it's out there. It's pretty obvious.
12. To put it bluntly: in US popular culture, greens are seen as humorless, sanctimonious, uptight moralists who find fault in every little thing, who are incapable of relaxing &amp; enjoying things, and who, however noble their goals, are insufferable to be around.
11. There's a lot to say about this chapter. It was obviously disastrous for NBC to force "green" into their programming without any guidance. But at the same time, it was a stark &amp; disturbing revelation of exactly what cultural associations currently cling to "green."
10. ... the episode ended w/ the annoying enviro either going away, or the character who had briefly been gripped by environmental sanctimony "getting over it." (That's what happened in How I Met Your Mother: Ted got super preachy &amp; annoying, then returned to "normal.")
9. ... was always grudgingly accepted. It's just that they were *annoying*. Second, the changes the enviros advocated were inevitably cast as irksome sacrifices that made life more difficult &amp; less fun. Living green was very clearly presented as a drag. And third ...
8. Nagging other characters about their plastic straw, where their clothes were manufactured, what they eat, etc etc. A few things were common in all these characterizations. First, the enviros were never characterized as *wrong*. The virtue of their ultimate goals ...
7. I can't claim to have watched all the programming on Green Week, but I watched a lot of it, and in every single case, the manifestation of "green" was the same: into the show was introduced a preachy, hectoring, morally superior enviro obsessing over every little daily thing.
@PetrosGhali I will add that to my growing stack of terrible analogies.
6. Lacking any guidance from NBC, or any user-friendly resources to learn more, the creatives behind NBC shows, forced to incorporate "green," simply fell back on their pre-existing impressions &amp; associations &amp; stereotypes. And what were those? Funny you should ask.
5. Most people had no frame of reference whatsoever other than the simple fact that this was "environmental" -- the latest thing environmentalists were going on about, some new kind of pollution, some new set of threatened critters, something something.
4. "Green week" perfectly captured what went so horribly wrong with all this. The thing is, though Gore made climate "trend," as we say these days, the vast, vast majority of people, including the people making pop culture, didn't understand it.
3. "Green" popped up in commercials, movies, &amp; sports events. And, most memorably for me personally, NBC instituted a "green week" during which all their programming would be, in some vague &amp; poorly specified way, "green." It was a strange &amp; heady time.
2. ... the last few days reinforced that tenfold. So I want to share one last anecdote &amp; then hopefully leave the subject behind. Pull up a chair.		Back around 2007, Al Gore's first movie came out &amp; green was briefly "cool" in pop culture. Magazines had glossy "green issues."
1. All right, I view the argument over personal carbon-cutting behavior as a toxic distraction, taking place almost entirely *within* the already insular climate community &amp; mostly furnishing ways for ppl in that community to bash others in that community. And ...
@KralcTrebor You're willing to crap all over climate advocates because you "think" your pet policy would get broad bipartisan buy-in?
Hard to understate the extent to which, from the POV of people in my generation &amp; younger, "inflation" has been used almost entirely as a scare tactic to squash social progress. People using inflation as a cudgel have done far more damage than inflation has in my lifetime.

@KevinClimate @StuartBCapstick @kcoplan @coralsncaves In short, it looks to me like something climate people do to impress other climate people. At the very least, the notion that behavioral purity among climate activists will meaningfully raise the odds of collective action is wildly speculative &amp; unsupported.
@KevinClimate @StuartBCapstick @kcoplan @coralsncaves It seems just as likely to distract attention from the needed collective action &amp; focus everyone's attention on who is or isn't sufficiently pure, who is or isn't a hypocrite. It raises the bar for involvement in climate advocacy &amp; repulses everyone irritated by liberal smarm.
@KevinClimate @StuartBCapstick @kcoplan @coralsncaves What I see in this discussion are lots of lots of sweeping &amp; utterly unfounded certainties about the effects of individual action on collective action. It is far from obvious to me that having a core of preachy, morally superior behavioral purists makes such action any likelier.
@KevinClimate @StuartBCapstick @kcoplan @coralsncaves No need to guess what I think, I wrote words! To wit: individual action matters *only to the extent* that it influences &amp; encourages collective action. To the extent it does in fact influence &amp; encourage collective action, it matters &amp; is worthwhile!
This is yet another illustration of a point that's been clear for decades now: coal is "cheap" ONLY to the extent that its social &amp; environmental costs are shuffled around &amp; concealed from view. Wealthy execs profit; ordinary folks end up with the bill.
The story of "cheap coal."	1. Coal cos. pollute for free, giving the illusion of cheap power.	2. Coal ash ponds pollute state water, have to be cleaned up.	3. Coal co. persuades leg to make ratepayers cover the bill.	4. Ratepayers pay $5 more a month.	https://t.co/ET771oh79l
So much US political commentary is based on a model -- a center and two extremes, with bills "more likely to pass" the closer they are to the center -- that bears no resemblance to current reality. Zombie political CW that just keeps stumbling forward. 🧟‍♂️

@duncan__c @ElephantEating It wasn't a jab, we really need to eat less beef &amp; I welcome anyone trying to build social momentum behind that!
@dvs1444 Luckily no one concluded that.
@eligit But note that neither panels nor EVs are sacrifices, as in Kevin's framing. Both are cool tech upgrades!
@duncan__c @ElephantEating Duncan, a question: as you are building your social movement behind reducing beef consumption (godspeed, btw), will people who still consume beef be allowed to join &amp; advocate for the same changes? Or will/should the movement be composed solely of non-beef-eaters?
@eligit Yes, rooftop solar &amp; electric cars have both been shown to be "contagious." Insofar as that's true, it's another good reason to do those things and talk them up! https://t.co/0ixY1HbObD
@ODouglasPrice @kdrum What you're describing is organizing people and pressuring politicians to make positive changes, which is exactly what I'm advocating.
@DoctorVive Trace that out though. It would be seen &amp; received *exactly* as a symbol of tribal membership, which would strengthen my ties with other members of the tribe, but tangle climate policy up w/ a bunch of tribal signifiers, thus raising barriers to entry.
@toxicpath @DoctorVive Well then that's not a sacrifice. Kevin was speaking in particular about difficult, inconvenient things (like, say, buying a Tesla if you aren't a millionaire).
@Erasmus111 They hit home because people misunderstand climate change &amp; they mistake climate change advocacy for a cult of personal purity. Environmentalists shouldn't encourage them!
I wrote about both studies here, the last time I went through this argument (there are no new arguments): https://t.co/zQgnZAMShL
Similarly, a 2016 study found that “environmental self-identity did not predict overall energy use or carbon footprint.” The people who think they are "walking the walk" are, to put it bluntly, fooling themselves. It is mostly a signaling game among the affluent &amp; educated.
In other words, the consumers most likely to see themselves as "green" are more likely, on average, to be a) wealthy and b) engaged in feel-good activities that don't have much impact. It is ultimately wealth, not self-identity, that predicts emissions.
Second, a 2017 study found: "Our results show that individuals with high pro-environmental self-identity intend to behave in an ecologically responsible way, but they typically emphasize actions that have relatively small ecological benefits.”
You'll improve your physical and psychological health. You'll reduce local air &amp; water pollutants. You'll produce less waste. You'll set a good example. These are all great reasons! It's just that climate change isn't one of them. It's a different kind of thing.
Two points I wanted to add to this thread. First, I'm not opposed to sustainable living. There are tons and tons of reasons -- both personal &amp; social -- to ride bikes more, recycle, buy an electric car, or put solar panels on your house.
@PsychSailor Serious, but not serious enough to use google to find the multiple extended pieces I've written on it?
@upine Yes. I don't get why people don't see that this whole line of thinking &amp; critique is a gift to the right.
@KimDrury2 It's "like" that, is it?
@GoCurrey How is explicitly advocating for social and political change "inaction"?
@GoCurrey @KevinSLeahy Yes, IF a billion people made voluntary lifestyle changes, it would make a difference. But you see, don't you, how you're kind of begging the question? There is less than zero prospect of persuading a billion people to do that.
@Erasmus111 Would I be a less effective advocate for Medicaid if I smoked or ate fatty foods?
@dmichie66 @GretaThunberg Congratulations for at least saying "possibly"! Usually people just assert that with blithe certainty, despite the total lack of evidence.
@onlxn Again, this analogy betrays a misunderstanding of the scale! Just on a mathematical basis, my single vote is a VASTLY greater proportion of total votes than a ton of CO2 is of the atmospheric stock of CO2. I could give up meat for LIFE &amp; it would still be a smaller proportion.
@kidcongo 🏆
@onlxn It won't solve the problem, it won't make a meaningful dent in the problem, and the TITANIC social effort involved in persuading 1% of meat eaters to go vegetarian would be vastly better spent persuading policymakers to raise the cost of meat by 1%.
@onlxn Compare: "If global beach erosion is a serious problem, then everyone should be carrying individual handfuls of sand to their local beaches." That's more like the scale involved here. (Or perhaps: carrying individual grains of sand to beaches.)
@Barbiewithatude No.
@apocaloptomisti Would you throw a piece of garbage the size of a grain of sand out your car window? Because that's a far better analogy to the scale involved.
@michaelerard "We refuse to vote for Waxman-Markey because Al Gore's house."
It's a collective action problem. We figure out how to take collective action or we are well &amp; truly fucked. Personal asceticism is largely irrelevant. &lt;/fin&gt;, probably
Anyway, like I said, live however you want, but I just don't agree that climate hawks should be highlighting a connection between climate solutions &amp; pain-in-the-ass voluntary sacrifices. If fact they ought to be doing the opposite!
Similarly, I do not now voluntarily send the gov't more than my tax bill. We would rightly view advocating for that as a goofy distraction. What I want is for the feds to raise taxes, including on me. If they do, I will happily send more!
Right now, I fly &amp; eat meat. I also advocate for policies that would make flying &amp; meat eating meat much more expensive (i.e., more reflective of their true social costs). If such policies pass, I will fly less &amp; eat less meat. So will everybody else! Voi la, no hypocrisy.
As for the power of symbolism, I don't even like the symbolism of sacrifice! If we put the policy &amp; technology in place, living a low-carbon life will be BETTER. Healthier. More fun, more sociable. The dreary symbolism of sackcloth &amp; ashes works *against* climate momentum.
As for the dopey charge of "hypocrisy," no. Hypocrisy is expecting others to live by principles you refuse to live by. I'm not asking other people to make meaningless personal sacrifices! I'm asking them to advocate for changing policy (and to abide by the law thus changed).
Voluntary personal choices matter ONLY to the extent they raise the probability of policy/structural changes. If they don't, then you're not doing a little good on climate, you're doing, effectively, none. There are lots of reasons to live a clean life, but climate ain't one.
Climate change is not an "environmental problem." It's far deeper than that. Solutions require basic changes in technology, law, and infrastructure, none of which is affected by individual behavior. I can't build a subway or pass a carbon tax or string transmission lines.
It's been a disaster for climate change to be viewed through that same lens. It causes confusion on both ends -- the nature of policy needed &amp; the role of personal virtue.
Environmentalism has always been a weird amalgam. On one hand it recommends structural/policy reforms. On the other hand it's always contained a strong strain of quasi-spiritual, in-touch-with-nature, leave-no-trace personal virtue. It's both a reform program &amp; a "lifestyle."
One more thought on this: the notion that voluntary individual behavior is a meaningful way to address climate change is a hangover of the fact that climate change entered the political sphere via "environmentalism."

@mrowlitor I loathe that question.
Whereas people do not respond all that well to, "please just tell me what you like and I'll say that, whatever it is!" Anyway. &lt;/fin&gt;
The left thinks this makes it "reality-based" &amp; savvy, but just as often it makes Dem pols hesitant, backward-looking, and weak. If left leaders act &amp; speak as though climate is a crisis, they will create that social reality. People respond to courage &amp; conviction.
Rove said, "we create our own reality. And while you're studying that reality—judiciously, as you will—we'll act again, creating other new realities, which you can study too." What he was getting at is that the right sets out to shape reality while the left reacts to it.
I'll conclude this unplanned rant with an Unpopular Opinion. Remember that famous Karl Rove quote, "we create our own reality," that everyone spent years mocking? I've always thought it was wildly misinterpreted. Rove was capturing an important truth.
If Dems told them, "people like us view climate change as an urgent crisis, warranting dramatic, large-scale action," they would go along! But Dems never have that confidence. They're always keeping an eye on polls, as though a current snapshot of opinion = hard political limits.
Most ordinary people, with busy lives &amp; families &amp; jobs, don't have time to investigate stuff like this &amp; form independent opinions. They just want to know, "what do people like us think/support?" They're content to follow identity cues. This isn't an insult, just reality.
Dems are always chasing public opinion, as though public opinion is a set thing, a feature of the world to which they must adapt. The ideological warriors on the right set out to SHAPE public opinion, and over the decades, have succeeded wildly.
People who DO have settled opinions on these things tend to have them because they are committed partisans &amp; have adopted the partisan position, not because they've done independent research or investigation.
Another way of putting this: most people don't HAVE settled opinions on matters of any scientific or policy complexity. They form opinions in response to poll/survey prompts &amp; the opinions are heavily influenced by wording, the current weather, mood, whatever.
Which is to say: public opinion on matters of any scientific or policy complexity is shallow, incoherent, variable, easily swayed, and far more indicative of identity signaling than any real understanding.

We change politics or we face catastrophe. Keyboard warriors assembling their policy fantasy drafts aren't changing politics. And that's fine. But could they maybe at least not spend their time diminishing the efforts of people who are?
Changing politics is what the GND movement is trying to do. Smugly crapping on them because politics has not yet changed, because wan, insufficient crap is all we're currently capable of is ... I mean ... I don't have the words. That's how you want spend your life?
Here's the thing: there is no plausible policy solution to climate change that is "realistic" within the current bounds of our dessicated, corrupt, dumpster-fire politics. Ergo, any plausible policy solution will require *changing US politics* in a serious way.
Which illustrates that the vast majority of people who say they "believe" in climate change do not really understand it, haven't internalized it, and are not *behaving as though* it is real. For some reason, that has depressed me more than anything in the past 2 miserable years.
One thing that's become super-clear in recent weeks is that, in the context of US politics, hippie-bashing remains far more important &amp; attractive for most people than stepping back, contemplating the enormity &amp; severity of the problem, &amp; thinking in novel or creative ways.
Tax fetishists don't have a better political solution; they don't have a better economic solution. What they have is a way to bash leftists &amp; signal to other VSPs how smart &amp; sophisticated they are.
In fact, activists &amp; serious carbon wonks (as opposed to economists) agree that a carbon price should be part of a package of measures, but achieving rapid decarbonization, politically &amp; economically, requires many complementary measures &amp; policies.
That was the point of the original tweet. If tax fetishists are so certain that a tax is a more saleable way to decarbonize than a broad package of measures like the GND, let's see them put forward a tax that can do the job. Let's see how that's received.
A carbon price like *that* is no easier a lift than the GND. It wouldn't be "bipartisan." It wouldn't be more efficient. It wouldn't be the ideal policy, even absent political restraints. It's a ludicrous way to set out to decarbonize an economy, politically AND economically.
But a carbon price designed to substitute for the GND, to accomplish the total, rapid decarbonization the GND targets, would have to be *extremely* high. Estimates vary but it's definitely many hundreds of $ per ton, possibly over a thousand.
Tax proponents like Yellin who say their solution is more "efficient" &amp; "politically realistic" are pulling a trick. A *modest* carbon price might have some chance of actual votes from actual Rs (though I highly doubt it). A *modest* carbon price wouldn't disrupt the economy.
The point GNDers keep making, and tax fetishists keep ignoring, is that a price on carbon, in whatever form, is not *enough*. The task is too big; the time remaining too small. A non-intrusive, gradually ratcheting price would've been great 30 years ago. Now, too little too late.
I'm not opposed to a carbon tax. No one on the left outside of a few fringe groups opposes a carbon tax. People who keep urging GND proponents to adopt a carbon tax "instead" of the GND are (many I suspect deliberately) pretending otherwise.
I'm trying to have a nice lunch in a ski lodge, but people have reacted to this tweet in so many dumb ways that I wanna say a few things about it.
@MarkARKleiman Nobody has done more to advocate for (or pass) market-stimulating policies than the environmentalists you VSPs love to shit on. Nor do I know any who "despise" such policies -- they just view them as inadequate on their own. Sad this debate has done nothing but jerk your knee.

"It's not realistic," intoned the white men who had led the world to the brink of catastrophe. "Trust us."
@SamWangPhD Everyone (weirdly IMO) interpreted the above comment of mine negatively, but it was not meant that way. I meant that, if I were sitting down with a blank sheet of paper to design fantasy politicians, I'd come up with Abrams &amp; AOC, in part because of the skills you mention.
And the farce thread continues, as we discover that Trump literally asked someone to nominate him for a Nobel Peace Prize in his first year in office, even has he was putting asylum-seeking children in gulags. https://t.co/a7BtHEdQvL

Going back and watching old episodes of Community with the kids. It's fascinating to watch in light of Donald Glover's subsequent evolution -- and very clear that he was far &amp; away the best thing about the show. He's just remarkably elastic -- every line reading is different.
@dschatsky Glad this tweet is getting its due.
@TheDiscomfiture I got it and it's great!
All right, I'm flying to BDL &amp; getting a car (or possibly train) to New Haven. Thank you all for coming on this journey with me.
@pazzo83 Oh?
All right, it sounds like the easiest thing to do is to fly into Hartford &amp; get a 40-minute car service to Yale. Maybe I can find an electric one, sigh.
@VladGutman Yeah yeah I know. I'm just sick of casting about trying to make decent policy under the implicit constraint that in the richest country in the fucking world we're not allowed to raise taxes &amp; spend the money on good things.
I would reeeally like to avoid renting a car &amp; driving on east coast highways. How's the process of flying into JFK and switching to a train to Yale? Is this going to be like a 15 hour travel day? [wonders again why he ever says yes to things]
@samhaselby You mean getting from the plane to the train? Or the train ride itself?
@jgkoomey @RL_Miller How is the transfer from plane to train in JFK? Smooth?
@VladGutman I think this underestimates the psychological &amp; social power of "free." There are lots of interesting studies on this which I'm too lazy to track down right now.
@greenprofgreen @henryfarrell @JeffDColgan Happy to see the Gets It caucus growing!
So, I'm trying to get to Yale in April, and I'm looking at flights, and they all look like incredibly long layover-ridden awkwardly-timed nightmares. Am I missing something? Should I fly into a different airport than HVN?
@trevlevtweets The reason I'm so cranky lately is I'm sick of keyboard warriors who dream up endless "plans" telling the people out actually *doing the work* that they are not "serious" because they didn't include this or that favored policy plank. Feh.
@trevlevtweets Blue sky plans are cheap, a dime a dozen. It's an easy intellectual exercise. I could crank out a few in an hour. The hard part is figuring out how to generate the political momentum to force action.
@trevlevtweets Because when I say "plan" I don't mean some blue-sky policy bouquet dreamed up by an economist in his office. I mean a plan to *actually solve the problem*, which involves power &amp; organizing -- wrestling with political economy.

@jason_pontin @deepstatedes Oh, golly, I'd never heard about the merits of carbon pricing until your pompous lecture. Wait until the people who have devoted their lives to thinking about the political economy of this issue hear your revelation!
@trevlevtweets When Noah Smith organizes thousands of activists, creates a coalition of policymakers, and succeeds in driving his version of the GND onto the national agenda, I'll have an opinion on it. Every f'ing keyboard warrior has a plan. Been true for decades now.
@philritz1 GND activists are working to *make* their vision politically feasible rather than issuing confident pronouncements about what is and isn't politically feasible from behind a keyboard.
@jason_pontin @deepstatedes Carbon dividends are not popular in polls have have no record helping carbon pricing pass. You are a political naif, passing sweeping judgments on people who are out in the streets &amp; in legislative hearings, working to change the real world. Luckily you have plenty of company.

It's something the Climate Wonk Brigade doesn't get either. Right now, the GND fight has very little to do w/ the specific details of the resolution - exact timelines, exact technologies. What's going on now is deeper, more symbolic, more binary.
This is something "moderate" Ds perpetually fail to understand. When they cringe, apologize for their activists, promise to be civil &amp; bipartisan, they don't get credit for moderation. What the public sees is *weakness*, people who don't believe in their own fucking cause.
This is a moment of truth for Ds. It's not about the substance of the GND resolution. That's not the point. This is about whether Ds will cringe when Rs raise a hand. It's about whether they will apologize for their most active &amp; aspirational supporters. https://t.co/3aTv9cNWst

The basic institutions of US public life hold the left to different standards than the right. Have for years. There's no point pretending this isn't true.
"OK, then the left will just declare climate change an emergency!" Here's the thing though:	1. No, they won't. They don't have the stones. 	2. If they did, every US institution would react differently -- fellow Dems would scold, media would scold, SCOTUS would block.
The right supports its own team. On the left, we have a small group of kids desperately trying to push adequate climate solutions and then a vast army of people who see their primary role as lecturing the kids about the shortcomings of their plan.

All humans (especially conservatives) suffer from status quo bias. The way things are just seems right and normal. Change always brings some level of anxiety. But that impulse has become incredibly dangerous. Change is our fate for the next few centuries. We must deal with it.
This is the fundamental underlying fact shaping climate politics: doing nothing (or too little) is the most radical choice of all, the one that invites the most disruptive change and suffering. It is the people tamping down ambition who are the dangerous extremists.
This very good piece from @MikeGrunwald makes a key point: anyone who finds the GND ridiculous or unrealistic needs to explain why it is less ridiculous or more realistic to let the ravages of climate change unfold as forecast. https://t.co/XCKBDVii3L
Also, what's wrong with just taking California's example national? The state is targeting 60% renewable electricity by 2030, 100% zero-emissions electricity by 2045. It's using old-fashioned energy portfolio standards, which are tested &amp; proven. Why reinvent the wheel?
@hausfath @mark_lynas Oh jeez I didn't realize how old the original tweet was. Ignore me.
That would make more sense to me. I dunno anybody who thinks 100% clean electricity in 10 years is doable. Even by 2040 is ambitious AF. But a 10-year mobilization, yes, that we can do. More than anything we just need to dramatically pick up the pace.
Squinting at the language of the GND resolution now, as far as I can tell, it never directly calls for 100% clean electricity w/in 10 years. It calls for 100% clean electricity (&amp; a bunch of other lofty goals). Then it calls for tackling all of them via a "10-year mobilization."
@mark_lynas That's not what the resolution says. The resolution leaves the door open to renewable and "zero-emission" sources.
@JamesSurowiecki @jtemple @mattyglesias You're wrong about this James. The language is meant to leave it open. The fact that some AOC staffer wrote a dumb FAQ doesn't change that.
Someone in @AOC's office decided to put up a FAQ that steps all over the resolution &amp; causes precisely the needless fights the resolution avoids. If it was on purpose, it was dumb. If it was careless, it was really dumb. https://t.co/mTUecjqLFR

@Mr_Berman It me.
To be real clear here: there is NO scenario in which the US hits its climate targets while keeping coal around. *Maybe* you get some natural gas with CCS. Maybe. But coal? No. It's coal or climate, a stark choice.
Quote from Joe Manchin, at his very first ENR Committee hearing since becoming the top Dem on the cmte: “Even in states with aggressive clean energy goals, if it gets cold, we will still need coal power.” 😒

EPA's job is to "social engineer" -- specifically, to social engineer an economy with less pollution. Jesus the right has just gotten so, so dumb. Why does their dumbness seem to depress me more than them?
This is the head of EPA saying that EPA -- the agency whose job it is to reduce pollution -- should not discriminate among fuels based on how much pollution they produce. I mean ... that is LITERALLY the EPA's job. He can't even pretend to share his agency's basic mission!
This is hilarious. New EPA head Wheeler says it's not EPA's role to "tip the scales" for or against particular vehicle fuels. He calls it "social engineering" to try to shift the market to cleaner cars. https://t.co/i3X1z4f9NV

@pegskidj @ezraklein @kate_manne Or maybe we could not turn this thread into a debate about Ralph Nader. Making this thread about a man would be ... particularly ironic.
7. Anyway, huzzah to @kate_manne -- her answer made me clap to myself, on my dog walk. Let's talk about women &amp; girls -- not as a segue to anything else, not as an example or an adjunct, but just b/c they're human beings, half the species, &amp; it is their. f'ing. turn. &lt;/fin&gt;
6. ... MOSTLY it's bad for women &amp; girls. They have suffered most &amp; longest &amp; suffer still today. They deserve some time at the center of attention &amp; care for once, without being constantly asked to recede &amp; share the spotlight. It will take conscious effort to do that.
5. So yeah, patriarchy is bad for men &amp; boys. It's bad for nongender &amp; transgender people. It's bad for everyone under the sun, really, except for a few privileged males. That is all true. However ...
4. All of us in this culture have been socialized to do this -- to subconsciously put girls &amp; women in the supporting role &amp; to make someone, anyone else the protagonist. The socialization is so powerful that even feminists themselves struggle to center ♀️.
3. It was a small moment &amp; passed quickly, but I found it meaningful. One thing I've learned from listening to feminists &amp; watching them in public dialogue: our culture makes it *extremely difficult* to center women &amp; girls. They are decentered in 1000s of subtle &amp; unsubtle ways.
2. At one point Ezra asks, basically, doesn't patriarchy hurt men &amp; boys too? It's a perfectly reasonable question &amp; subject of inquiry. But I just loved her answer. Basically: "yeah, but I'm leaving that for other researchers. I'm focused on women &amp; girls."
1. A quick &amp; somewhat random thread, before I forget. On his podcast, @ezraklein recently interviewed philosopher &amp; feminist @kate_manne. It's fascinating for a million reasons &amp; I'm still processing it, but I wanted to call one small thing out. https://t.co/yugxVmL1Yz

The left's job is difficult &amp; can't be accomplished with the right's tools. Progressivism means striving (&amp; frequently failing) for something higher. On the bright side, no cult-like worship of hateful dolts! And with that, I bring this random Friday ramble to a close. &lt;/fin&gt;
Figuring out how to balance interests &amp; improve the most lives in the most enduring way isn't anything like pooping in a punchbowl. It requires smarts, organizing, political savvy, &amp; the emotional wherewithal to live with almost-continuous disappointment.
it's just to say that, when you marvel at the dumbassery on Fox &amp; think "I can't believe we're losing to these morons," remember that "winning" means very different things for them. You can ruin a party by pooping in the punchbowl. It's easy &amp; requires no brains.
This isn't to say all lefties are smart or all righties are dumb. The left has failed over &amp; over again in America, so clearly it could be smarter! And DC is full of very smart people who have put their intelligence in service of a movement of nihilistic assholes.
The cosmopolitan project - bringing wider, more diverse circles of people under a framework of shared values &amp; rules in which they can mutually benefit - *requires* accuracy &amp; intelligence. It's a project riddled with tricky questions &amp; agonizing trade-offs.
You often hear calls for a "left tea party" or a "fighting left" to match the right's destructive ferocity. And, yes, fighting spirit is good! But it's worth remembering that the left can't just use the same tools the same way, because its aspirations are fundamentally different.
Whereas, stitching things together, building up institutions that work, finding policy mechanisms that improve lives without unanticipated side effects, figuring out how to keep diverse interests on the same page -- that stuff is difficult, emotionally &amp; intellectually.
I think about it too, when normals ask me how Trump &amp; his band of morons managed to win &amp; do so much damage. They don't need to be smart! They don't need any savvy insight or strategy. The sad truth is, even the dumbest assholes can do a lot of damage.
I think about this as I watch the morons on Fox misunderstanding how sunlight works. That movement doesn't select for brains or accuracy because *they are not adaptive in that environment*. What brings success &amp; social reinforcement in that movement is being a bigger asshole.
Something I've discovered as I've gotten older that I didn't understand when I was young:		Being an asshole is easy. Being cruel, tearing things down, sabotaging things -- easy. You don't need to be smart.		But being good? Building things, lifting people up? It's HARD.

@SphallSteve1245 Correct.
Trump has flirted with herrenvolk socialism -- indeed, that's probably why he won. If he'd stuck with it, he'd be much, much more popular &amp; I'd be much, much more terrified. But the GOP establishment brought him to heel, quite easily. Now it's just plutocracy + cruelty.
Herrenvolk socialism is what the Tea Party wanted, if you look at what they were really saying rather than the sanitized DC version. "Protect/increase our benefits, eg Medicare, but cut any benefits going to Those People." GOP elites jammed that into the old "small gov't" mold.
The electoral sweet spot is herrenvolk socialism -- a generous welfare state for the, er, right kind of people &amp; harsh laissez faire for Others. It's a huge untapped electoral force because it is the opposite of what appeals to wealthy US elites.
I'm not the first to note this, but one of the funnier aspects of Schultz's campaign is that there IS a large unrepresented constituency among US voters: fiscally liberal, socially conservative. IOW, the exact opposite of Schultz's schtick.

@rev_avocado Endorse.
@Ben_Geman How do you figure? Seems to me it would put Manchin in a perfect position to water down &amp; compromise the bill, just as D "moderates" did with ACA. The last vote needed becomes the arbiter.
If rural &amp; suburban whites wanted to stop punching themselves in the face (in the hopes that they might also do some damage to blacks or immigrants), they probably wouldn't have elected Donald Trump.
The authors of that Brookings study take this fact to mean that the politics of climate change might be more tractable than expected -- on the assumption that climate damages will change the minds of people in the affected states. That seems rather ... optimistic to me.
The US states run by climate deniers are precisely the states that are going to be hit hardest by climate change. https://t.co/NQWtCnMK0w https://t.co/l6iB9HDRDU
@ScipioAcheronus @Frel_ Sure, I'll take credit for that!
To my mind, it will take 3 of the things Rob mentions. First, Ds must take the Senate. Second, they must scrap the filibuster. And third, there must be a surge of grassroots energy sufficient to make even Joe Manchin nervous. (I list those in order of increasing implausibility.)

@Frel_ Also very true. https://t.co/kXJi73JbLy
Anyway, as usual, @EricLevitz said all of this much more cogently: https://t.co/997kaPaDCt
But the policies Schultz is pushing are absurd, on purely economic terms -- far more absurd than the demsoc policies being pushed by, eg, AOC. There is nothing at all to recommend them *except* their appeal to rich people. That is their sole advantage (and not a small one!).
America's political class -- pols, staffers, lobbyists, journalists, etc. -- spends most of its time around rich people, or consuming the opinions of rich people. The views of rich people come to infuse US politics at an almost subconscious level. They *sound* right to elites.
It's not "more realistic" than democratic socialism, or "more grounded in economics." It's an unholy conglomeration of myths &amp; failed policies that retains its grip on American politics (despite being extremely unpopular) because it APPEALS TO RICH DICKHEADS.
The one positive thing that could come from Shultz's run: everyone finally sees that the weak-tea, center-left, deficit-hysteria, we-can't-afford-anything platform, which dominated the Dem establishment for so long, is, empirically &amp; economically, bullshit.

Have some pride. Have some dignity. They hate you, they hate the values you stand for, they view you as an object to be manipulated for political gain. They crap all over you &amp; your institutions, publicly, constantly! Yet you keep simpering for their approval. It's gross.
Of course they will bitch &amp; moan &amp; accuse you of bias. Their only goal is winning &amp; they've learned that bitching about bias serves that goal. Playing the refs is just another part of the scam, just another way to spin &amp; manipulate you. Quit f'ing falling for it!
When a movement &amp; its representatives lie to you repeatedly, the reasonable thing to do is to start *treating them like liars*. Quit extending the presumption of credibility. Quit assuming good faith. ASSUME THEY ARE LYING until you have overwhelming proof otherwise.
We're heading into the most important election of our lives. They're going to be lying to you *constantly*, about everything, with the sole goal of winning a news cycle. You know this because they've lied to you hundreds of times in the recent past.
I don't even know why I'm tweeting all this. Beats pounding my head on the table I guess. I'd just say, to political reporters who still have some aspirations at journalism: the RW is full of liars &amp; fantasists. They've been lying to you for years. They're going to lie more.
Just glance over here at this thread, as a conservative "reporter" pulls something out of her ass &amp; the entire movement immediately begins spreading it. It's just one little example - happens a dozen times a day. https://t.co/kUvYpOtYQa
There is no conservative media. It's the conservative movement - in media, politics, &amp; think tanks, lobbyists &amp; businesspeople - it's all the same, an ethnonationalist movement that sees itself in a zero-sum struggle for dominance. It has abandoned shared standards of accuracy.
We saw it play out recently with the "Pocahontas" thing. Yeah, yeah, Warren botched it, but why did she have to address it at all? Why did it get anywhere? Why didn't every adult human being simply laugh dismissively when it came up? Because reporters indulge the RW. Endlessly.
What would it take? Democracy is being hurt by this. Media's being hurt by it. Our ability to act as a coherent polity on the basis of shared facts is being hurt. All because the mainstream political press is terrified of being scolded by the right for bias.
I just feel helpless at this point. What would penetrate, say, the politics desk at NYT? They keep fucking up in the same ways, getting the same critiques, &amp; rejecting the critiques -- getting angrier at the left for critiquing them than at the right for playing them repeatedly.
I've ranted &amp; raved about it for over a decade now, to no effect. It's beyond clear what's happening, but reporters still line up for it - to be played, spun, deceived, used as tools in a reactionary anti-democratic effort designed, in part, to destroy the institution they serve.
It happens over &amp; over again: right-wing scumbags make something up, the media indulges it, it turns out to be BS, but the damage is already done. Again &amp; again &amp; again &amp; again, since the '90s, at least. It's become the dominant dynamic in political media.

Put another way: dealing with Trump involves putting aside anything you learned dealing w/ self-governing, rational human beings who have coherent, consistent goals. Treat him like a big, dumb, blundering, rage-blind animal. Easier, in some ways, but profoundly unfamiliar.
The key to dealing with Trump - and I think Pelosi gets this - is to maneuver him into a contest where a) he can't win and b) he can't back down. He's completely unable to self-regulate, so the rest is easy: just sit back and watch the gears grind until something blows up.

13. And they don't have to see or engage what I write. Everyone can be happy! It's a wonderful system. With that, I will leave this exquisitely stupid &amp; trivial "controversy" behind &amp; endeavor never to speak or even think about it again. Happy weekend! &lt;/fin&gt;
12. And that's the beauty. The Brave Truth Tellers who are in denial about being a-holes can continue tweeting &amp; backslapping one another about their bravery &amp; the fear they're striking in the hearts of the Establishment. That's fine! I just don't have to see it or engage it.
11. Indeed, I encourage everyone: make your Twitter experience pleasant! Block jerks; pay attention to interesting &amp; creative people. You don't *have* to respond to dumb crap &amp; engage in bad-faith squabbles. It's your lawn; you decide who gets to wander on to it.
10. Here's the thing about Twitter: I'm not paid to be on it. It's a private product I'm using voluntarily, for pleasure. I don't want an "echo chamber" - I engage lots of folks w/ different perspectives - but I have zero obligation to put up w/ unpleasant people.
9. Anyway, I blocked RPJr. inadvertently, but his subsequent silliness has confirmed the wisdom of the decision. Same goes for some of the other folks ranting about the supposed Block Conspiracy. I hadn't realized I blocked them but am retroactively glad I did!
8. Lots of folks on the internt have been blocked, banned, or otherwise shunned because they're a-holes, but who tell themselves it's because they're Brave Truth Tellers &amp; the lemmings just can't handle the truth. MAGA twitter is *full* of these types - they put it in their bios!
7. His ego defense for all this is to imagine himself a Brave Truth Teller &amp; all the people who don't like him as Groupthink Lemmings who want to build an Echo Chamber. Anyone who's spent any time on social media will find this ego defense very, very familiar.
6. I swore off interacting w/ him because he's a deeply unpleasant person who interacts in a slippery, bad-faith, snotty, duplicitous way that leaves everyone involved feeling generally icky. Over the years I've seen dozens of people make the same decision, for the same reasons.
5. ... the notion that I care enough about RPJr. &amp; what he tweets to engineer some grand suppression plan is a hoot. I didn't even know he was on Katharine's list. I have not interacted directly with him in years. And why is that exactly? Well I'll tell you.
4. As for this, it's been making me laugh &amp; laugh. It is so perfectly revealing. But, needless to say, I have no idea how to "sanction someone" for interacting w/ someone else on Twitter, or what that would even mean, or why anyone would bother. But above all ... https://t.co/h0AhJ2R5Pa

2. Some of those lists were from a service that maintains lists of bots &amp; trolls. And then I also used @KHayhoe's list, which she generously shared. That one is hand-crafted by her. Apparently a few of the folks on it believe their inclusion is unjust.
1. Oh jeez, I go offline for a day or two and a kerfuffle breaks out. This is very stupid kerfuffle, overall &amp; in each of its particulars, so feel free to mute. For the record, though: I recently blocked a bunch of people, using block lists.

Go back in time and kill Baby Climate Change.

My Baby Hitler take is that the whole thought experiment encourages us to think of history in terms of Good People &amp; Bad People rather than examining structural factors &amp; repeating patterns of bad decisionmaking. Also I am fun at parties.

I see conservatives are fake outraged about something and the media is playing along by pretending it's a real thing and liberals are taking the bait and allowing this fake outrage to dominate political news.		Must be a Thursday.
We're seeing it play out now. There's 1000 ways Trump could have backed out of this shutdown w/out much damage, but he cannot abide the thought of losing. So he'll cling to this maximalist position come what may, right up until the wheels fly off or Congress finally gets a pair.
I shoulda put this prediction on record earlier, but I've always suspected that a full-blown constitutional crisis, if it comes, will be precipitated by something relatively small. Trump will take some position &amp; his ego simply won't allow him to back down.

You could get even more modular - create just a wheel/motor combo, stackable batteries, some kind of self-contained axel. Just make car-building like Legos. Then other companies could "make cars" w/out the enormous upfront capital barriers - they'd just be dressing up the Legos.

@SpenceEnergyUT In my experience, no one gets pissier in response to being generalized about than boomers. A more cynical type than me might suspect some level of defensiveness ...

Tribalism, fear of the unfamiliar, insistence on clear binaries &amp; hierarchies ... all these things are death for creativity. That, not some grand deep-state conspiracy in Hollywood, is why conservatives are rare in creative fields.

10. Or maybe not! Maybe we can pull it off gracefully, without sacrificing any of our other values &amp; priorities. But at the very least, with the GND just gaining momentum, it's too early to be closing off options or dividing into factions. &lt;/fin&gt;
9. But the urgency &amp; severity of climate change mean that I, like everyone, probably won't get exactly what I want. We need to decarbonize not just at some point, but ASAP, which may involve some otherwise unpleasant social &amp; ecological tradeoffs. https://t.co/5vxCMXVT7h
8. Obviously I have my preferences. I'd lean into accelerating the fantastic recent progress in RE. I favor RE for a whole bunch of social, economic, &amp; ecological reasons. I very much believe we will, at some point, end up with a system run entirely on RE.
7. "Carbon-free energy" simply brackets the question. It foregrounds the high-level consensus (reduce greenhouse gas emissions) &amp; leaves the fights over specifics (there will be many, many fight over specifics) for later.
6. What I keep trying to emphasize is that it's no sacrifice for enviros to make that tweak. They're not giving anything up or reducing their ambitions. When it comes time for policy specifics, or the balance of policies, they can &amp; should continue to push for renewables.
5. The way to do that is an easy tweak: target "carbon-free energy." If you think that should/will be 100% renewables, fine. If you think it will require nukes or NG+CCS or BE+CCS, fine. The language accommodates you both; it does not adjudicate between you.
4. Today's post takes no position on that debate. It just says: building the broadest, loudest movement behind decarbonization is the priority. The top-line language of the Green New Deal (or any similar nat'l effort) should solely focus on decarbonization. That's the north 🌟.
3. And here's a deeper, slightly nerdier dive into it: https://t.co/sPud1tDPiT
2. If you are interested in that question, I've written about it before. Here's an introduction to the debate: https://t.co/TknzoL5wro
1. One clarification about today's piece: the argument does not involve any substantive position on the question of what will be required to decarbonize electricity. It's not an argument that nukes &amp; CCS will be needed, or that they won't be needed.

@KHayhoe @salianij Consider this a request!
OK, apparently it is possible to import a list of accounts and block them all at once. But where does one find such lists? Anyone out there know?
Another thing Twitter needs: the ability to auto-block people based on various criteria. Like wouldn't it be nice to just block everyone with that dumbas walk-away tag in their bio, all at once? Or those dumb red X's. https://t.co/nE2urLZmYc
Ah, important clarification! https://t.co/sEV1Hit1wy
Two things Twitter needs: 1) the ability to block lists of people, all at once, and 2) a new rule that someone you've blocked can no longer comment on your tweets. (h/t to @Noahpinion for the latter one, which now seems blindingly obvious to me)
All right, before I wade in to do some, ahem, feed maintenance (ie, blocking a bunch of mofos), a question: is there any faster/bulk way to block people? One-by-one gets pretty tedious.

The second season of The Good Place was indeed a HUGE improvement on season 1. Really fantastic. But I still can't get past the central premise that becoming a better person is primarily about *learning moral philosophy*. My MA thesis is literally devoted to debunking that.
8. It's corporatism &amp; crony capitalism masquerading as populism -- a bunch of confused &amp; vaguely reactionary narratives distracting from the core goal of concentrating more wealth &amp; power at the top. In short, it is Trump all over. &lt;/fin&gt; https://t.co/0ULyC3Hb3e
7. The status quo is a corrupt deal between multinational corporations &amp; politicians. It's a crap deal for ordinary people, as evidenced by the health outcomes. The fact that they've got ordinary people defending them, casting critics as elitist, is a brilliant f'ing con.
6. They lobby &amp; bribe politicians to regulate them loosely, to subsidize their products, &amp; above all to help them avoid financial responsibility for the social, health, &amp; ecological damage they do. They plaster advertising on every available surface, object, or medium.
5. ... of virtue, patriotism, populism, down-home community, derived from the people who use their products. But that's just advertising. These are giant multinational corporations. Their primary objective is to deliver quarterly returns to shareholders. All else is subordinate.
4. ... it is super-weird to then extend fast food some sort of populist credibility, as though to criticize it is to criticize the people who eat it. It seems to me that is exactly what McF'ingDonalds wants. It's what Chevrolet &amp; WalMart want. They all want a protective sheen ...
3. Yes, in many places fast food is the cheapest option, so many poor &amp; working class people depend on it. Yes, it tastes good, because it is literally designed in f'ing laboratories to stimulate our taste centers. So, yes, lots of ordinary people eat it &amp; like it! But ...
2. ... backed by ubiquitous, relentless corporate advertising. Yet somehow this unholy stew of capitalist exploitation &amp; corporate welfare has taken on a vaguely populist air. Already I guarantee there are people responding to the first tweet calling me a tedious scold.

The guy knows less than the average online schmo who just reads a few articles a day. All he knows is what Fox tells him. He is literally the old, grumpy, half-senile uncle watching Fox &amp; griping about Kids These Days. It's genuinely difficult to internalize that.
The most difficult thing for political analysts dealing with Trump is that it's really, really hard to wrap your head around the notion that the guy in power, at the center of it all, knows LESS than the average analyst -- less about events, less about gov't.
An incredibly important discussion for Dems -- how to deal with their geographical disadvantages: https://t.co/xxXfdFF8Zk
ANALYSIS: After carefully considering his options, Trump has once again elected to go with a "belligerent, confused, flailing bluster" approach. Join our panelists as they attempt to reconstruct some plausible account of his reasoning!
This kind of analysis amuses me to no end. As though Trump considered reasoned persuasion -- understood what that means &amp; how to do it -- but elected to go another direction. https://t.co/Jk25z30fzd

@mldunham On EVs, cities can be most helpful by converting any fleets they own, along with city buses. Taxis &amp; rideshare vehicles can be pushed to electrify. If there's a port, you could tighten emission standards there. And charging infrastructure is a big things cities can influence.

@maureenogle Not my essay!
@mldunham Start closing off key blocks or areas to through traffic - create pedestrian zones clustered around markets and other civic infrastructure.
@TheEnergyNerd Good thread -- this is a political economy perspective that is too rarely articulated.
@SquidGertrude We both worked &amp; shared the duties roughly 50/50, but she is like you -- she's glad she did it but has no nostalgia and zero desire for more kids. (I'm at the point where I'd have kids until I'm 70, like some creepy Hollywood celeb, if she let me.)
@FastFM Yes, that is both true &amp; wise.
... there's no judgment. There's no "normal" kid &amp; there's no "right" way to experience parenthood. Those who find it a slog have nothing whatsoever to apologize for. I just rarely see the non-slog perspective articulated, so I thought I'd articulate it.
Oh! I meant to say this first &amp; forgot: my kids were easy! They were both healthy, free of disability or illness. They weren't *great* sleepers but they weren't terrible. And they've both always been pretty reasonable &amp; even-tempered. I am acutely aware of our luck. Again ...
A final note: when I contemplate my kids leaving home, I don't feel any thrill of anticipation. I don't look forward to "freedom." For me, freedom means losing my tether, drifting off into my head again, out of the world. I think about it every day &amp; dread it with all my being.
Anyway, with all due respect &amp; no ill feeling toward the original poster, I'll just say: having kids has been far &amp; away the best thing I've ever done -- not just "best" in some spiritual, abstract way, but the *most fun*. I loved every minute of it. Still do!
... parenthood is the one thing, the only thing I've really found, that blasts through that, that drags me into the world -- the physical world of limbs &amp; diapers &amp; snot &amp; horseplay. It holds me in the world; I am *needed* there. Every stinky pair of underwear I wash reminds me.
I am by nature an extremely cerebral, introverted, introspective -- I spend a lot of time in my head, at a distance from the world. At times in my life, that distance has made me lonely &amp; unhappy; I felt like I could just drift off &amp; it wouldn't matter much to anyone. But ...
I enjoyed all that stuff in the same weird way I now enjoy doing my family's laundry. Sure it's kind of tedious, but it also puts me &amp; my hands to use, weaves me into the lives of those I love. I enjoy all that stuff almost as much as I enjoyed the reading, cuddling, etc.
And I don't mean this as a treacly, "yes it was exhausting &amp; frustrating but it was worth it for the warmth of a child's smile," blah blah. I mean, I genuinely enjoyed changing diapers, long stroller walks, getting up in the middle of the night, dealing w/ public meltdowns, etc.
My experience was a bunch of people (and pop culture generally) *telling* me it was going to be exhausting, frustrating, etc. -- and me girding myself for that -- and then discovering in practice that I f'ing loved every second of it.
I absolutely, 100% do not judge or begrudge anyone who feels this way, but just for the record, it was not my experience. https://t.co/XP9h47zWUD

@mateosfo @DanStefanich @AOC I don't think we would. It's not innocent ignorance. Thinking this way is socially &amp; materially beneficial to white males; they have enormous incentive. I mean, you don't need advanced psych to see why it's ridiculous, just common sense! They resist that; they'd resist more data.
Oh &amp; I forgot the most salient example: the nature of the RW base itself. Now we have RW "thought leaders" looking around, saying, "hm, it kinda looks like almost nobody is sincerely committed to 'small gov't' &amp; it's all just white/Xtian tribalism." Uh... yeah.
I remember this manifesting in the Obama years in David Brooks columns, where he'd say, basically: "Obama should stop doing [ludicrous Fox caricature] and instead do [literally what Obama is doing]."
Thus you have, eg, current (sporadic) conservative efforts to acknowledge climate change &amp; support aggressive policy responses to it -- responses that include carbon pricing &amp; innovation spending, per libs -- but always, always with at NOT LIKE THE LIBS gloss.
You could list more. Reactionary policy grows out of fear &amp; anger -- in the long term, it is inevitably corrosive &amp; ineffective. But RWers in this country have been fed a ludicrous, blood-soaked caricature of "libs" for so long that admitting libs are correct is impossible.
Late capitalism's corrosive effects on community are one area. Climate change, obviously, is another. The effectiveness of robust social-welfare spending is another. The systemic roots of drug addiction &amp; the superior social &amp; economic results of treatment over incarceration.

@DaveThomer I am certainly not arguing against facts &amp; evidence. I'm just saying they will always underdetermine political &amp; policy questions. They are inert without values.
None of these disputes can be "fact checked." Science isn't going to settle them. Artificial intelligence is not going to solve them. Facebook is not going to develop an algorithm to decide between them. They are contests over values &amp; will be won or lost on that terrain.
They want to serve industry &amp; degrade the environment; I don't. They want to strip the state bare &amp; privatize public functions, agencies, &amp; spaces; I don't. They oppose intellectualism, cosmopolitanism, &amp; urbanization; I don't.
They want a white Christian, patriarchal, ethnonationalist state; I don't. They want to concentrate power &amp; wealth at the top; I don't. They want to split asylum-seeking families apart &amp; put them in gulags where they are mistreated; I don't.
The primary problem with today's Republicans is not that they are Wrong On the Facts (though they are). It's that they have an ugly set of values. They are cruel &amp; petty &amp; selfish. They back policies that are unjust &amp; immoral.
We are in the midst of a titanic struggle over values. The technocratic left's forlorn faith in "fact checking" reflects its perpetual refusal to engage that struggle forthrightly.

@CalvinSloan @CitizenCohn @TopherSpiro AOC's 70% tax on incomes over $10M wouldn't raise all that much revenue. GND proponents will *never* be able to credibly promise to raise as much revenue as they want to spend. So I think they should be clear about rejecting that constraint.
@CalvinSloan @CitizenCohn @TopherSpiro Hm i"m not making myself clear. Of course I support taxing rich ppl more. What I question is the wisdom linking that (or any revenue-raising policy) to "paying for the GND." If you do, then ppl will ask where you're going to get the *rest* of the money.

But either way, you're saying some version of "there's no need to pay for it." If that's the message, then *also* saying "we'll raise taxes on the rich to pay for it" muddles things. No?
@ricredman There's no getting down the learning curve without scale and for CCS the *only* reason to scale is a CO2 price. EOR, even if it weren't a f'ing twisted justification for "climate policy," won't get it there.

@TopherSpiro Well I mean that's certainly fine with me! I guess my concern is just that a) this public debate is going to be very, very stupid, b) Rs have a stupid-simple position, easy to understand &amp; repeat, and c) Ds don't. (I presume we agree that the merits are irrelevant here.)
"What the world wants is for our powerful biases to be buried under a sheen of 'objective' language so that they can influence readers without us having to take responsibility for them!" https://t.co/lM2mt4tyzY
@TopherSpiro I dunno. Either we take the MMT perspective or we don't; either deficit spending is a perfectly legitimate economic tool or something Bad. If you acknowledge that the GND needs to be "a little bit paid for," you're giving away the game.
Doing a little bit of both, which is what seems to be happening at the moment, isn't going to work. I personally favor the latter, but getting Dems to sing from that hymnal is going to be very, very, veeeeeeery difficult.
Green New Deal advocates need to decide if they want to propose ideas to "pay for it" (like AOC's higher income taxes on the wealthy) or if they want to argue that, per @StephanieKelton, "paying for it" is an incoherent notion.

@tatere Yes.
21. Anyway I should stop rambling (probably should've stopped a while ago). In conclusion, only active planning &amp; management can ensure that the growth of our cities is equitable &amp; sustainable. In the US, city planners need more authority, $$$, &amp; power. &lt;/fin&gt;
20. In Barcelona it's 3% &amp; the current administration aspires to get it to 10%. I'm too lazy to google, but I'm guessing in most US cities it is less than that &amp; pretty crappy. To really preserve diversity of income will require social housing for the middle, not just the bottom.
19. ... I don't know any rapidly growing city that's solved the affordability problem. It's just very, very tough. I don't see any solution long-term but lots more social housing. In Vienna, 60% of housing is social, subsidized in one way or another.
18. Not to say activism &amp; pressure on biz can't work to shift the politics - they can! - but shifting politics is the goal. OK, one final point. I think we have a decent sense of how to get green, walkable, sociable cities; lots of work to do, but solutions exist. However...
17. Same with walkability, public &amp; green spaces, bike infrastructure, the right mix of residential &amp; business activity -- it can be had through planning. So the ones to pressure are the *planners*, the policymakers, not the private actors operating w/in the current system. IMO.
16. Now there are a bunch of big condos, a bunch of families, &amp; a bunch of good downtown schools. If the people of the city want families, they can have them. They don't have to sit back &amp; hope the market provides.
15. ... since growing US cities are having a notoriously difficult time keeping families around. He said (paraphrasing), it's not magic. Families need 3- &amp; 4-bedroom condos. So we passed a rule saying developers have to build a few of those for every X units they build.
14. ...to simply &amp; transparently dictate the outcomes they want (which is why so much policy gets buried in the tax code &amp; obscure rules). I remember walking through downtown Vancouver w/ @BrentToderian (city planner 2005-11) &amp; asking him how they kept so many families there...
13. The best, healthiest, most livable cities I've spent time in got that way through *planning* - intense, close, passionate planning by people who loved the city. Americans have an anti-regulatory, anti-gov't strain in their politics that makes them unwilling or unable ...
12. But my general take (which I think is the correct leftie take! ) is that it's fruitless to demonize people or businesses for pursuing their interests within the law. The way for citizens to express their interests is through *government*. Policy. Rules. Investment.
11. What's the solution to the dilemma of growing well? One thing that frustrates me about these debates is, it seems like my fellow lefties have identified, as their enemies in this fight, the people &amp; businesses who want to come to the cities -- gentrifiers &amp; greedy developers.
10. SF is becoming dystopic, with manbunned VC investors piloting electric scooters through the refuse of homelessness. It's top &amp; bottom with less &amp; less in between. Other growing cities sensibly fear that fate - thus the angst in Seattle over Amazon's growth.
9. Tech workers &amp; millionaires can afford new homes, but renters, service workers, students, &amp; many long-time residents are getting pushed out to crappy housing on the periphery that requires long, draining car commutes. Everything central is gentrifying.
8. Predictably, as demand continues exceeding supply, prices are going up. People lucky enough to have bought early enough are sitting on gold mines, constantly accruing value. They have every financial incentive to fight any new housing, to maintain the supply/demand imbalance.
7. Here's the fundamental dynamic in SF, Seattle, etc.: they're nice. They're growing, businesses &amp; jobs are moving there, people are moving there. But they are not building new housing at anything close to the rate people are arriving. Housing isn't keeping up.
6. That said, obviously growth can be managed well or poorly - it can be more or less just &amp; equitable, more or less sustainable, more or less pleasant. The debate shouldn't be growth or not, it should be *how to do growth well*. Lots of places are f'ing it up.
5. So if you live in a city, you should want the city to be growing &amp; thriving. The alternative sucks ass. That's the baseline (&amp; what I meant by the original tweet). What's more, cities are going to grow all over the world this century, like it or not, so there's no real choice.
4. Any sane person should prefer growth. Managing a declining city is incredibly difficult. It's worse for everyone, *especially long-time residents &amp; low-income workers*. It's ugly &amp; unjust &amp; I think you'd have a hard time pointing to a city that's done it gracefully.
3. ... improving schools, building infrastructure, &amp; investing in civic life, or tax revenue is shrinking, all those things are getting cut, more people are leaving &amp; revenue is shrinking more. Whether positive or negative, it's self-reinforcing cycle.
2. As I see it, cities are either growing or shrinking. I'm not aware of a city of any size that has managed to reach some perfect equilibrium, healthy but neither adding nor losing population. Cities are either adding people, businesses, &amp; tax revenue ...
1. OK, this tweet created some agita, so I thought I'd do a quick thread to explain myself. This isn't some big treatise on urbanism (I'm procrastinating on Real Work), just a few thoughts off the top of my head. In a nutshell: we need to get good at making good cities.

Good lord I've got to stop looking through these comments. It's like they all read the back of an Ayn Rand cereal box and called it good.

Gore was too stiff &amp; formal. Then he dressed down &amp; tried to make jokes and it was "earth tones" and "trying too hard" and "inauthentic." On &amp; on &amp; on. Narratives are bigger than facts; facts don't dislodge them. Controversy only fuels them. There's no winning.
Hillary tried to play this game her whole career. Don't respond, you're dodging. Respond, you're being defensive. Respond too softly &amp; you should have been louder. Respond to loudly &amp; you're shrill. Respond to X narrative &amp; you just reinforce Y narrative. There. Is. No. Winning.
OK I really gotta run do errands, but I can't BELIEVE the responses saying, "well Gillibrand could just deny it!" Have you people not been watching for the last 30-some years? You think if she draws 10X attention to this story by denying it, that will STOP the narrative?
@yeselson Rich, dude. You've seen these cycles. Do you think Gillibrand publicly denying or dismissing this thinly sourced piece of garbage would put it to rest? Seriously?
The your/you're mistake in tweet #2 invalidates this entire thread and my whole career and I'm retiring now.
20. In conclusion, beware the "narratives," most especially the ones you agree with. (Probably shoulda ended on the last tweet, but I like a nice round number.) &lt;/fin&gt;
19. No one has an easier time manipulating us than those who are telling us what we want to hear. So those are the kind of stories to which we should apply extra skepticism. And yes, I'm preaching at myself here, too.
18. I don't see how else to stop it. And it's utterly corrosive. Bullshit narratives about Gore STILL persist, to this day, despite being total &amp; complete vaporware. Every Hillary hater is STILL convinced that she is omni-incompetent &amp; diabolical, weak &amp; a warmonger, all at once.
17. If you see a "news" story that tells you exactly what you already believe about a politician, maybe, before RTing the headline all over the place, read it &amp; see what actual evidence is on offer. The speed of Twitter discourages this, but it's worth the extra minute.
16. Anyway, I have no idea at all how to stop this in media. It's less any political bias than just a bias for clicks &amp; mindshare. The social &amp; economic structures media operate in seem to make it inevitable. But at the very least, media *consumers* could/should wise up.
15. In my adult lifetime, Obama is the *only* politician I've seen who had the ability to resist these narratives. They tried so hard, with "aloof" &amp; "professorial" &amp; "arrogant." They just couldn't get them to catch on. But not every politician can be Obama.
14. It is beginning with AOC, even as we speak. The "narrative" is that (because she's young, female, &amp; attractive) she's a ditz. Journos will pluck things out of context, quote anonymous sources, refer to one another ... the narrative will be self-reinforcing.
13. Again, the point is not to defend Gillibrand. The same dynamic happens again &amp; again. Al Gore was "stiff." Kerry was boring. Hillary was shrill &amp; dishonest. Everyone knows it, so everyone writes it, so everyone knows it. The lack of original evidence fades into to the ether.
12. Then, eventually, there are enough such stories that journalists no longer feel obliged to even pretend to support it with evidence. It's just obvious. "Everyone knows" it. I mean, look at all the stories!
11. Thus you'll get a flood of stories on the theme, most of which (if you look closely) are vapid, most of which are relying for evidence on the OTHER vapid stories. It becomes a closed, self-reinforcing loop until it's "obvious" to everyone that it's true.
10. When you reinforce existing narratives, people have a MUCH lower threshold of skepticism. People who already "know" Gillibrand is a Wall Street shill will now find their "knowledge" confirmed by this "evidence" ... which reinforces the narrative, which leads to more stories.
9. (OK well not *viral* viral, but among the community of political nerds &amp; influencers on Twitter, a Thing.)
8. As a piece of journalism, it is utterly worthless. But that wasn't the point. The point of the entire sordid exercise was to produce this tweet, which, as they no doubt predicted, is going viral: https://t.co/7RixhnQA9u
7. Is Gillibrand calling other kinds of donors? Are other potential candidates also reaching out to potential donors in various industries? Is there anything at all unusual or untoward about reaching out to potential supporters? CNBC readers will have absolutely no idea.
6. And what evidence is brought to bear to support this implication? Here is is: "according to two senior business leaders who spoke on the condition of anonymity." That's it! Literally, that is the ONLY EVIDENCE. "Two senior business leaders" said so.
5. The story (and associated tweet) strongly lean into the implication that Gillibrand is calling her masters on Wall Street, asking for their support as she attempts to become president &amp; do their bidding, under cover of progressivism. So clicky!
4. CNBC knows that very well. It knows that if it publishes a story "confirming" that pre-existing narrative, it will get tons of clicks. Might even go viral. Thus, this story: https://t.co/Q3KddaU3Xu
3. When it comes to candidates, that means reinforcing whatever "narrative" has built around them. So take Gillibrand. What's the "narrative" that makes Dems suspicious of her? One is the idea that she's faking progressivism &amp; is secretly a Wall Street shill.
2. Say your a political outlet &amp; you are in an endless war for clicks &amp; eyeballs. What can draw them? One reliable method is to reinforce people's priors -- confirm to them what they already think they know. People like that feeling. They'll click on that stuff.
1. Since we're thinking about the role of media bullshit in presidential campaigns, let's take a look at how it works. As a preface to this thread: I like Gillibrand fine, but I'm not stanning for her or anything -- this is just an examination of media dynamics.
@yeselson Consider whether CNBC might understand this dynamic quite well, and be using it to harvest all these hate clicks, based on a paper-thin story without a single corroborating source quoted.

Some of the intra-Dem tensions &amp; fights are so stupid &amp; baroque that I'm already losing track of what they're about and it's only January 2019.
Instead of pressing our advantage and putting Republicans on the defensive, let's show them that they can ease the political pressure on this with a few pathetic token acknowledgments of reality. Let's assure them they're not in any real danger. Galaxy brain!
"Democrats should celebrate Republicans who are out front on climate change." Yes, despite the indisputable fact that one party is (fairly) good on this &amp; one party is terrible, let's confuse voters into thinking it's all a muddle. Let's lower the bar until a few Rs can clear it.
I have seen versions of this story every single year, starting around 2006 or so. It convinces a lot of gullible climate hawks to go easy on Rs, lest they derail this allegedly growing momentum. Meanwhile, in real life, the GOP just gets worse &amp; worse. https://t.co/KmZtIZT8R1
It would be cool if journalists covering female pols exercised a modicum of self-awareness &amp; self-criticism. But instead most will jump straight to the straw man -- "you're saying all criticism of Warren is sexism!" -- to protect themselves from such unpleasant responsibilities.
"I'M not saying she's shrill and unlikeable. It's just that 'people' are saying that, so I have to cover it." And so you end up with this giant miasma of sexist bullshit, but, oddly, no sexists! Just as we have deep &amp; systemic racism yet no one who'll cop to being racist.
One of the (many) shitty aspects of journalism-as-theater-criticism is that it allows all sorts of sexist biases &amp; tropes to disguise themselves as judgements about "likeability," etc. Then they become a self-justifying narrative, a "story" the other journos have to cover. https://t.co/IV9gxaNrN6

21. And if some day I get fired over a stray tweet, well, we can all look back on this thread &amp; have a good laugh. "'Benevolence' he said! Ha ha!" In the meantime, I love all y'all, even the losers &amp; haters. Happy 2019! &lt;/fin&gt; https://t.co/fo2MwhnXYS
20. Aaaaaaanyway, I'm not nuking the archive, at least today, though I reserve the right to do so at a moment's notice. Maybe I'll set it up so that everything over a year old is nuked or something. Or maybe I'll just trust in the benevolence of my fellow humans. [blink]
19. These are dark times -- Twitter reminds us of that plenty -- but they are also times in which simple expressions of decency &amp; solidarity matter. And despite all its well-known dumpster-fire tendencies, Twitter reminds us of that too. My own feed reminds me of that!
18. Anyway, I guess what I realized (or remembered) is that the best part of Twitter is not individual tweets, but the community &amp; fellowship. It can be extraordinary sometimes -- look at all the courage &amp; compassion in this thread, for instance. https://t.co/KhYsPonoC2
17. Or this thread. It's not 1000s of responses, but every response is meaningful. It has become a real resource (I'm busy building a Spotify playlist from it) for aspiring bassists. All these people contributed their thoughts ... seems callous to axe it. https://t.co/3ahRlEE1ow
16. Or I think about this thread. This question somehow sparked something for people &amp; now there are 6.7K replies (!!!) -- just a fascinating survey of genres, generations, &amp; the power of music in individual lives ... I f'ing love it. How can I kill it? https://t.co/0fi7ZswOnl
15. It's one thing to nuke my own comments, but nuking a conversation like that ... it feels bad. Like, somehow, through some alchemy, it became bigger than me; it has a significance separate from me. Replies *still* trickle in, almost daily. Who am I to cut that off?
14. And I started thinking about, for instance, this tweet, which much to my surprise went semi-viral. The tweet itself is nothing special, but there are so, so, so many great comments -- funny, droll, heartbreaking, inspiring. It's a feast.  https://t.co/IuLhFrRSRF
13. In preparing for another nuke, I went back &amp; looked at the old archives I'd downloaded (first time I ever actually looked them). I discovered something I suppose, in retrospect, is painfully obvious: your archives are only your tweets, none of the responses.
12. The other strategy is to periodically nuke the archives, so that it's NOT a permanent record. I've done that a few times. 2009-2017 is gone (thank god -- who knows WTF I was saying in, oh, 2010). I've been planning to do it every so often. Which brings us to the present.
11. I'm basically incapable of that. And I don't *want* to do that. The whole fun of Twitter is the timeliness, the conversation &amp; iteration, the inside jokes that come &amp; go in a day, the provocations. I like to test out arguments, even ones I'm only half-convinced by myself.
10. One strategy is to treat Twitter like what it is -- a permanent record -- &amp; tweet only careful, edited comments, little mini-proclamations. Give up on the conversation part, just use it to broadcast &amp; publicize. Plenty of folks have gone this route &amp; I totally get it.
9. Anyway, as long as you're a person with any public profile, having a database of thousands of stray (unedited) comments following you around is a danger, practically an invitation to anyone who wants to F with you. What to do, what to do?
8. The stuff I put on Vox is checked &amp; edited; it goes through drafts. Tweets, not so much. Tweets are very often written based on Kahneman's "system one" thinking -- the gut, instinct -- and published too rapidly to be checked against system two. https://t.co/3jnrHRdV35
7. All those thousands of comments, most of which I've long forgotten ... am I *sure* there's nothing in there that a hostile person could dig up, isolate, frame in the worst possible way, and get me in trouble? The answer is no, I'm not sure &amp; never really could be.
6. Now, I don't *think* there's anything in my archive like that. I've said plenty of things I dearly wish I could rephrase, and a few things that were insensitive in ways I now regret, but I don't think I've said anything potentially career-ending. But ... am I sure?
5. So we're hanging out, BSing, but we're also implicitly promising to own every single solitary thing we say forever. It's unnatural, a recipe for disaster, &amp; indeed it has been a disaster for career after career -- one stray hot-headed or ill-considered comment &amp; it's over.
4. But of course, as many have learned to their great chagrin, it's not ephemeral -- it is all recorded in a publicly available, searchable database. Every. Single. Comment. What's more, each comment becomes free-floating, stripped of timing, context &amp; history. Each stands alone.
3. That informality causes people to let their guard down &amp; say things they might not want to stand behind forever. There's *tons* of stuff that I might say when BSing with friends that I would not want inscribed forever under my byline. It's part of what BSing is for!
2. Why was I going to nuke the archive? Because Twitter is dangerous. What it *feels* like, and how people *want* to use it, is basically as real-time conversation -- jokes, riffs, odd thoughts, &amp; other ephemera. It feels like we're all just hangin' out, BSing.
1. Hey y'all. So, I was gonna nuke my Twitter archive, to get a fresh start for the new year. But when I sat down to do it I just ... couldn't. If you, sensibly, don't care about my Twitter decisions, mute this thread. Forthwith, an explanation &amp; a few reflections on Twitter.

Something to look forward to in 2019: 1) people note that criticism of Woman Candidate X (WCX) is colored by sexism, 2) WCX critics immediate transmute the critique into a strawman, ie, "criticism of WCX is driven solely by sexism," which they vigorously refute, 3) repeat.

But people blame themselves, and feel shame about it, so it doesn't get talked about as a public policy issue, which is too bad, since it's largely a result of sociopolitical choices.

@mattyglesias Your worst take ever.
@Apinak This is perfect -- always the pivot Obama-bashers make at this point. No one said the word "impotent." You said he could have transformed the economy, but chose not to. I just asked for an explanation of how he could have done so. You leapt straight to a strawman. Why?
@brendanpierpont 😉
@MattTheGweat @MichaelDKarras @bigtoonah Lefty twitter's serene assurance of its own moral superiority is one of its most attractive features.
@Apinak No, that's not evidence at all. You owe us a counterfactual in which Obama transformed the economy (thanks to all those opportunities he had to do so). What did that look like? How did he overcome total GOP intransigence plus a Cong. Dem caucus filled with cowards?
@johnlk_80 @SniperHyperbole It was not popular.
@Tzipshmil OMG it's like a little poem!
@brendanpierpont I download them all before axing them - dunno if you can do that automatically?

@zuffcat Yes, that was some bullshit.

@rebeccamhersh Given that the entire GOP, 95% of Dems, and the American public all lacked aggression &amp; intensity on climate, what would more speeches from Obama have done exactly? I'm genuinely curious.
@ADowling34 Many times I've had occasion to wonder what critics think "pushing harder" would have looked like, or why they think it would have had any effect on recalcitrant Senate Dems.
@johnlk_80 @SniperHyperbole Sorry guys I already used my "hamburgers are bad" take -- this is what I've got left.
@geodirtdude The president does not write or pass legislation.
@archibaldcrane I would argue that the incipient collapse of the global economy was the most important issue. And he prevented it, thus probably averting suffering on the scale of the Great Depression, or greater. But people just take it for granted and whine at him for other stuff.
@Polyhemus_1 Agreed on all counts.
@Apinak Yeah, sorry, that's horseshit.
@tomphilpott A very good Q.
You may now unleash your annoying responses. Perhaps I'll find a few more folks to block before starting fresh tomorrow.
Adding: most critiques of Obama from the left are utter wankery based on ludicrous counterfactuals. He was &amp; is smarter than 99% of his critics &amp; did a better job than any of them could do. (The exception is that he legit f'd up the mortgage crisis, per Dayen et al.)
OK, here's one: I still love Barack Obama. I have more respect &amp; admiration for him than for any other politician of my adult lifetime -- literally the only one I'd consider a role model. I'd happily vote for him again, certainly over any of the other Dem alternatives.

@flanaganagain_ Nuclear power: eh, I don't really like the way it smells.
Yes, it's a low bar folks, but it is the only bar that matters. Which is my whole point.
@noahqk I'd say, if Democrats had been aggressive &amp; unapologetic in their climate advocacy, starting 15 years ago, politics would be very different today. I'm not sure what you would accept as "evidence" for that counterfactual.
I'm nuking my Twitter archives tonight, so today seems like the day for unpopular takes, and/or takes that will elicit annoying pile-ons. Love to nuke an annoying pile-on! Lemme see what I can come up with.
@noahqk OK, but let's stop pretending that pursuit of Republicans is without cost. There are opportunity costs -- other, more aggressive rhetorical &amp; political strategies have been taken off the table for decades, lest we scare off the tiny handful.
My assessment of Warren: she would be a better president than Donald Trump.

23. To me, this is a classic example of people projecting layered intentions onto Trump because the stupid, stupid truth is too disturbing to contemplate. He said, "you mean to me so I mean to you." Surely there's more to it than that? No. No, there isn't. &lt;/fin fer real&gt;
22. I mean, consider: if you had a diabolical plan to systematically weaken a truth-finding institution so that you could lie without restraint ... would you SAY SO, out loud, to a f'ing journalist? That's not how diabolical plans work!
21. The press has no special status for him, it's just something that is threatening his narcissistic ego protection. "You say bad things about me so I try to destroy you" -- he would say the same to/about any person or institution.
20. But to Trump, like any malignant narcissist, NOTHING is special - not the press, not veterans or Gold Star parents, not heads of state. To him, all that stuff is on a flat, undifferentiated plane of Not Me. He will eagerly wage war on any of it to protect his ego.
19. WE read special significance into it because for US the press is not just another institution; it is the main mechanism by which the electorate is informed. It's *special*. To go after the press, despite its special status, must be part of some larger evil plan.
18. Some people point to that as evidence that he DOES have a strategy. But I think it indicates just the opposite, The way Trump sees it, if X person/institution criticizes him, he attacks X. For any value of X. That's all there is to it: press bashes him so he bashed press.
17. All right, one other thing to add! (This is all going bye-bye when I nuke my archives on Monday night anyway.) A few people have cited the quote from Trump to Lesley Stahl on 60 Minutes. Basically: "I bash the press so people won't believe bad stories about me."
@klrqueen17 @Fdr1942 @TomMostlyZen Amen to this. Shitty fathers are at the root of a LOT of historical misery.
@hilory I really think people misinterpreted that quote. It was just, "you say bad things about me so I try to destroy you." Same he'd say to any person or institution.
@zdp1234 @SamWangPhD Exactly!
@klrqueen17 Yes. Something else he revealed about us: how many Americans would happily embrace racist autocracy if "their side" is in charge.
@MitchSchindler Yes, politics is not the only system that he has exposed.
@jvgtweet @jeanpaulbondy Jennifer you just summarized my thread in half a tweet. ☹️
@Fdr1942 He stood before packs of furious, resentful people &amp; said ugly things until he found the ugly things that got the most shouts &amp; applause. Then he repeated them. What stopped people from doing that before him was *shame*, not some lack of cleverness.
16. In sum: the fact that Trump is diminishing &amp; degrading America does not mean he is secretly brilliant &amp; diabolical. It means America is secretly weak, afraid, and hollowed out -- not nearly so powerful as it imagines. Er ... Happy New Year! &lt;/fin&gt;
15. Among other things, it means the problems cannot be solved just by booting Trump out. America's weakness -- its susceptibility to bullshit, demagoguery, gaslighting, lies, &amp; corruption -- is greater than just Trump, and will outlast him.
14. But a thread on that stuff would take forever. My only point here is that it really DOES matter whether Trump is doing what he's doing consciously, strategically, with a plan. If he's not -- and I think the evidence overwhelmingly supports that take -- well, that's real grim.
13. I'm not going to get into WHY America found itself so vulnerable in 2016. It's some mix of decades of right-wing attacks on US institutions, rapid demographic changes, &amp; lingering pain from the 2008 recession. The lion's share of blame goes to conservative media, IMO.
12. Anybody can find themselves outmaneuvered by an evil genius. But when you find yourself laid low by a dimwitted jackass, it's time for some introspection.
11. America -- its people, its media, its politics, its institutions, all its systems of self-correction -- is so weakened that even a lumpen orange tangle of uncut venality can trample it. No evil genius required. Raw, theatrical ignorance &amp; resentment will do.
10. But if Trump is a blundering, flailing buffoon, blinded by unquenchable need &amp; bottomless resentment, incapable of the mental discipline necessary to distinguish fantasy from reality ... well then responsibility for all this does not belong with him, but with US. The system.
9. We were fooled by an evil genius, who saw more deeply than us, tapped more cleverly into the zeitgeist. It's unfortunate, but the solution to the problem is pretty clear -- get rid of the evil genius &amp; return things to normal.
8. If Trump is some sort of evil communications genius who figured out how to manipulate angry white people &amp; the media enough to hack the system, take over a political party, &amp; win the presidency, then the rest of us are, at least to some extent, exonerated.
7. Anyway, I've been over this a million times. So why does it matter? Lies are lies, bad behavior is bad behavior, who cares how much is conscious? The answer is, it matters because it informs how you assess the ugly political situation we're in.
6. Most people aren't like that &amp; have trouble believing others are. (Ask anyone who's ever been in an abusive relationship w/ one; it can take a LONG time to accept that it is what it is.) People end up rationalizing narcissists' behavior for them, just to make some sense of it.
5. This is why narcissists are so successful so often (at least for limited times): their internal architecture is profoundly unfamiliar to normal people. The separation -- what I want/feel/need over here, the world &amp; other people w/ their own needs over there -- is absent.
4. To be a good liar -- to "deceive," as a conscious act -- one must be able to hold reality &amp; one's lies separate. That very, very basic feature of most people's cognitive landscape simply doesn't apply to Trump. There is ONLY the raging ego &amp; the world it demands.
3. Trump is a malignant narcissist, which means he's got a gaping, insatiable beast of an ego that needs constant reinforcement &amp; affirmation. He's a slave to it (&amp; is ultimately miserable, like all narcissists). It tells him what reality must be; he builds a world to support it.
2. Anyone who's read my articles (or followed this feed) knows that I think the answer to these questions is both extremely clear &amp; extremely important. To wit: it is not conscious AT ALL. It is 0.0% a strategy. At no point has Trump been capable of behaving otherwise.
1. I would just add one thing to this very good thread. (Check out Greg's book!) The question regularly comes up: how conscious is this on Trump's part? To what extent is it a strategy, something he is choosing? Is he trying to deceive us or has he just deceived himself? https://t.co/oVAznNr55o

Oh, another cool thing you can do with Alfred: when I click cmd-alt-v, it brings up a list of the last 15 things I copied to my clipboard, and I can click on the one I want. IOW, I can paste something I copied a while back, w/out having to go re-copy it. SO handy.
The way I've done it is slightly baroque: download Alfred for Mac. (It's free.) Then go to "workflows." You can assign any key combo to any action or series of actions. Cmd-V is normally paste, so I made Alt-V paste without formatting. Easy &amp; crucial. https://t.co/k4dNkchkT9

@Laura5871 Hm, there's still time for last-minute edits ...
This one gets into the Kaya identity, the Carbon Kuznets Curve, the difference between territorial &amp; consumption-based emissions, and the distinction between economic-factor substitution &amp; logistical substitution. Basically, just what you're looking for on a holiday Friday. 🎁

@lkmangan80 They all said this one was different!
It contrasts, in every possible way, with the new Spider-Man, which was *bursting* with humanity &amp; idiosyncrasy.
It felt like a movie written by committee, designed to appeal to all demographics, sell toys, &amp; translate seamlessly to the Chinese market. It was a Product, devoid of idiosyncrasy or surprise. And honestly I just resented the use of '80s music cues for cheap nostalgia &amp; laughs.
Y'all I took the kids to see Bumblebee &amp; now I'm irritated at all the critics who oversold it. It is not as terrible the other Transformers movies -- truly, the lowest possible bar -- but it was witless &amp; devoid of imagination.

The movement should have to *account* for its idiocy. WHY did it insist on absurd nonsense for so long? What has it learned? How will it approach things differently in the future? Has it apologized to the scientific community it slandered for years?
Oh, and here's another note for journalists: a movement that has spent decades denying well-established scientific facts has embarrassed itself &amp; sacrificed its credibility. You should not let it flush that idiocy down the memory hole &amp; simply start fresh with new idiocy.
We don't have to get caught up in dumbass arguments about what's "mature" and what's "extreme," etc etc. We have objective metrics for climate policy. It either reduces emissions enough, fast enough, or it doesn't. Please stay focused.
Here's a memo to journalists: Republicans are going to start offering climate policies as they finally, incrementally retreat from denialism. Only one question about those policies matters: how much will they reduce emissions, and how fast?
@zoeverett That album probably has a claim to blowing more young minds than any other single piece of popular music ... perhaps with the exception of Zep IV.

@_randolph_west I am a non-religious person, for the record.
9. Anyway, I'm not a believer, but I still appreciate that sense of awe -- it reminds me of the power of religion, beneath all the ridiculous factual claims. It taps me into that feeling, at least when it's done right. So do it right. Just hit the f'ing notes! &lt;/fin&gt;
8. Honestly, one of my favorite versions is by (then-) 10 year old country artist Billy Gilman. He's got a sweet, pure voice &amp; he's too young to be arrogant enough to think he can "improve" the song. So he just hits the notes. It's gorgeous. https://t.co/YpU8GgL4qJ
7. But this is sadly true of *most* contemporary versions. It's become known as a singer's song, a chance for singers to show their chops. But that just makes it into a wanky, masturbatory exercise, a bunch of curlicue additions that only diminish the song.
6. The ultimate example of this is Mariah Carey. Her version of "O Holy Night" is not about awe in the face of divinity. It's about Mariah Carey, and what a great singer Mariah Carey thinks Mariah Carey is. https://t.co/yymUr6Badi
5. ... that the way to "show feeling," to lend the song power, is to enhance every note with a bunch of useless triling, the cursed singing technique known as "melisma." https://t.co/fzDl5JoTMF
4. ... here's the problem. The song is good because the notes of the song are good. They are arranged in a good order. The way to sing it well is to sing the notes in the proper order. That's all. Hit the notes! Unfortunately, lots of modern singers seem to believe ...
3. That chorus, man: "FAAAAAAALL on your KNEEEEEEES ..." Those crescendos are so good at voicing a sense of awe &amp; gratitude. But ...
2. Why is it the best? Because unlike most Xmas schlock, when it's done correctly, it actually captures something rare: the sense of majesty, of AWE, that is at the core of religion -- that sense of encountering a presence so total &amp; loving that one is overwhelmed.

@theturner I still listen to Fugazi's first three albums regularly &amp; they are every bit as fresh &amp; fierce now as they were then.
@peterjanes @loreena @alyankovic Weird Al's In-3D was the first piece of music I ever owned as my very own. On cassette. Bonus: Weird Al playing in the TN Tech gymnasium was my very first live music experience!
@TimForgot 🏂 while listening to this album is what my personal heaven will be.
Jane's Addiction led me out of the wilderness and then came Nirvana and the whole glorious early '90s -- grunge, Tribe &amp; Digable Planets &amp; so much great hip-hop, electronic music, jazzy stuff, etc etc. The early '90s were the peak of US pop culture don't @ me.
This was the mid-to-late '80s in middle Tennessee, which meant I was mostly listening to hair metal -- the unholy pop hybrid that metal had become by then. Def Leppard. White Lion. Whitesnake. Warrant. Skid Row. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
I am only slightly embarrassed to reveal that for me in was Jane's Addiction. Nothing's Shocking completely rocked my world. In particular, the first 30 seconds or so of this song still have an almost physical effect on me. https://t.co/uedDNEgs5O
Here's a fun question: what one album changed your musical tastes, and expanded your musical horizons, more than any other? (This isn't just your favorite -- it's the one you heard when you were a teen that led you out of your original music rut.)

I'm bowing out of this discussion and will be focusing my journalism on the native flora &amp; fauna of eastern Mongolia until 2021.
@HeerJeet @NateSilver538 If I found out Russians were pushing attacks on Trump &amp; trying to manipulate me into voting for Clinton, I would be upset about the meddling, but I wouldn't doubt myself. I'm confident in the info I have on Trump &amp; my judgement. Introspection ≠ guilt or shame.
@HeerJeet @NateSilver538 Also: huh, many of the distorted attacks, out-of-context memes, and mutually contradictory accusations that Sanders fans lobbed at Clinton were the very ones we've now learned Russian bots were pushing. Whether that's responsible for any outcomes or not, seems pretty interesting!
@HeerJeet @NateSilver538 Also recall that -- 100s of wildly defensive comments to the contrary -- I made no accusations or assertions. Just: huh, now we know for certain that what happened in the primary is exactly what Russia wanted &amp; tried to achieve. That seems a striking fact worth pondering.

To forestall the caricature: no, this doesn't means a given story or incident is ONLY about gender, or about gender INSTEAD of other factors. It is just to say that, if you assess such things without taking gender into account, you'll miss important aspects.
Just a note about this, before it becomes a Thing. Whether people like their boss, whether they feel mistreated, whether the boss's tantrums are considered "mean" or just "tough" ... all that stuff is *extremely* inflected by gender.
@JohnWest And TBC, it's entirely possible to do such inventory and conclude that you're confident that your beliefs were accurate &amp; your actions justified. (Generic "you.") Introspection doesn't mean apology or self-flagellation! It's not, like, a punishment.
@JohnWest Well, Russians set out to turn them against Clinton in order to help Trump get elected. And that's what happened. Were I thus (successfully) targeted, I'd want to do a little inventory.

@Skvarlaland @scianalysis Well there's a circular argument. "There's no analysis." "Here's some analysis." "That is laughably hand-wavey, unserious analysis." "The issue doesn't deserve analysis." I guess we're done here.
@Skvarlaland @scianalysis Thanks for the mind-reading, but actually I prefer cap-and-trade with an actual, functioning cap. Regardless of that meta-debate, though, the fact remains: ARB has done no analysis of whether the system will meet the actually existing target.
@DavidKlion @SamSacks @JStein_WaPo I think that is a disanalogous situation for about a zillion reasons, but I gotta quite Arguing Online and get some real work done. (Sounds like your editor feels the same!)
@magdra @illnessideology I know another group of Americans who dismisses all criticism or even questioning with accusations of ideological betrayal.
@SamSacks @DavidKlion @JStein_WaPo Eh, I guess I'll leave you to this caricature.
@zezezebe @SamSacks @DavidKlion @JStein_WaPo All right, I think that's enough bad-faith and caricature from you. Bye!
@Skvarlaland @scianalysis OMFG, that tiny little three-paragraph response is so grossly unresponsive &amp; misleading. Totally mischaracterizes the worry about annual emissions. Then hand waves at a 1/3 chance that macroeconomic factors will tighten the market up on their own. So ... problem solved? Yeesh.
Whoa, that's a deep cut. https://t.co/O5vUOrmRB9
@scianalysis @Skvarlaland I would be fine with complementary policies being tightened to compensate for the weakness of C&amp;T. But the first step of that process is acknowledging the weakness of C&amp;T.
@zezezebe @wideofthepost @JStein_WaPo @DavidKlion Can you point to where this report calls Sanders supporters idiots?
@wideofthepost @JStein_WaPo @DavidKlion If you've "heard" a ridiculous caricature that no one actually believes or argues for, you should listen more carefully!
@scianalysis @Skvarlaland There's been absolutely no analysis by ARB of whether the current system would meet the 2030 target (which is an annual-emissions target), so we're all kind of speculating, no?
@DavidKlion @KatzOnEarth @JStein_WaPo I did not attack anyone. Nor did I dismiss legitimate objections to Clinton. It's a little like misogyny. Acknowledging it doesn't mean that criticisms were "just sexism." But it's delusional to dismiss its influence entirely. Thus: a call for introspection.
@dachoste You don't have to if you don't want to.
@SamSacks @DavidKlion @JStein_WaPo EVEN IF, as seems to be the case, you are 100% certain that the propaganda is true and that you would have believed it regardless, even if Russia hadn't set out to spread it.
@SamSacks @DavidKlion @JStein_WaPo Yes, I would think that any demographic targeted by propaganda for particular purposes -- and who ended up (at least in substantial numbers) believing that propaganda &amp; serving that purpose -- would take it as an opportunity for introspection!
@EDimantchev Maybe I'm missing something, but attributing oversupply to good-faith overestimates of future emissions seems a bit naive, or at least incomplete. There are *enormous* political pressures to keep prices low. There's a reason every new set of pols makes the same "mistake"!
@DavidKlion @JStein_WaPo All right. I respect your willingness to think this through. (Seriously.) The only thing I'd add is that citing "facts" and "perfectly legitimate" grievances rather undersells the tonnage of utter bullshit about Clinton that was circulating.
@Skvarlaland @scianalysis Can you point to some independent analysts (i.e., not ARB &amp; not an industry w/ a vested interest in keeping prices low) who argue that oversupply is not a problem?
@JStein_WaPo @DavidKlion Yyyyeah ... I mean ... that is an interesting restatement of the general leftie view of geopolitics, but it doesn't actually address the issue I'm interested in. More of a "look over here!" type thing.

@jbouie So pumped for this.
11. The longer this goes on, the deeper &amp; more structural the damage &amp; the longer it will take to recover. Meanwhile, we still don't have universal healthcare, inequality is out of control, &amp; the climate is overheating. This next election matters quite a bit. &lt;/fin&gt;
10. The competent federal bureaucracy left over from previous administrations is being rapidly eroded. The upshot, to my mind, is that The Damage Trump Can Do in his first term pales, quantitatively &amp; qualitatively, before The Damage Trump Can Do in his second.
9. That's what I mean about residual competence. And it's the same with judges. As Trump stacks the federal bench with more &amp; more FedSoc fanatics, there will be fewer &amp; fewer legal restraints on the march to autocratic plutocracy. Health care policy, climate policy -- doomed.
8. Soon enough, EPA will have a rigged scientific process that will tell it soot is just fine. It will have rigged analysis saying that its new pollution plans save money &amp; are healthy for women &amp; babies &amp; especially veterans. The truth about soot will vanish from government.
7. And so as to avoid any troublesome sass from experts, EPA plans to disband the scientific advisory panel that is keeping it abreast of the latest science. https://t.co/5OPIvRi2I3
6. But guess what? Trump's EPA wants to change the way the agency analyzes the danger of soot -- and it wants to allow higher levels of soot than what scientists currently recommend. https://t.co/rBH5dxpHjz
5. Why does EPA's analysis show that? Because easing carbon rules also allows more particulate pollution (soot) &amp; EPA scientists have found that soot is harmful even at low levels. The reduction in "co-pollutants" like soot is what makes carbon regs pencil out in the short-term.
4. ... the EPA's own analysis showed that the replacement plan would lead to 1,400 additional premature deaths &amp; 48,000 new cases of asthma a year. Trump's EPA is proposing to kill more people to save industry some money, and the official numbers show it. https://t.co/8uF525CGyK
3. To some extent, that remaining infrastructure of competence has restrained Trump, or at least exposed him. One example: Trump's EPA proposes to replace Obama's Clean Power Plan (CPP) with an Affordable Clean Energy (ACE) rule. One problem ...
2. By residual competence, I mean both people &amp; policy -- competent civil servants &amp; judges left over from competent administrations that preceded Trump (mostly but not exclusively Obama-hired or -appointed) &amp; competent analysis/policy done by those people, still on the books.
1. This evening's horrific ruling brings to mind something I've been saying a lot lately, namely: any analysis evaluating the damage Trump has done, or can do, must take into account residual competence. https://t.co/J1S0zylI5D

"This paper shows that a substantial reaction to global climate change (CO2 emissions extremum) will occur in 55 to 120 years (95% CI) with a model prediction of 80 years." Just an illustration that what's required in the face of climate change has no precedent.

16. I guess I'm just making the simple point that we don't have to be reactive. Positive engagement (of any kind) doesn't just happen - we can consciously increase its incidence! We can do it on purpose. I've been trying &amp; it really makes a difference.
15. So I've been proactively trying to respond to or engage with good stuff -- nice comments, funny stories, jokes, insights, whatever. It's not that hard to just say "haha" or "thanks" or "that's interesting" - just drop a little positive feedback in the world. It's rare!
14. Any writer - any creator of any kind - will tell you that, in general, it's the people who disagree or get angry who are moved to respond. 100 people can like something &amp; just nod; the 1 who hates it will write the angry comment. Doing otherwise takes some conscious effort.
13. And second, I keep trying to remember that Twitter contains wonders &amp; it's my choice how much of my attention they occupy. I'm trying to focus on people who are smart or funny or decent. I engage with positive or interesting or educational comments.
12. It's weird that it takes willpower not to do something that's going to hurt you (our evolved emotional machinery is not helpful here), but it does. Like anything that takes willpower, tho, it gets easier w/ practice. Don't engage ugliness. Breathe ... and let it go.
11. What I've been trying to do, fitfully &amp; with mixed success, is twofold. First, if it becomes clear a fruitful exchange is impossible (and it becomes clear quickly) just stop. Let it go. You don't have to have the last word. You don't have to respond at all!
10. It can settle *small* differences. Like if you share a bunch of background premises &amp; a basic political orientation, sometimes you can fruitfully hash out the details. But big stuff? Nah. So what to do?
9. And so people get drawn into fruitless, aggravating exchanges. Constantly. And that feeling - feeling misunderstood, hurt, &amp; unfairly treated - is what people hate about social media. It's best just to accept that Twitter is a terrible format for settling differences.
8. This translates, on Twitter, into an inability to ignore a person who is criticizing you in an unfair way, or saying something incorrect, or making a bad argument. Every little comment like that is like a mosquito bite. They itch. https://t.co/yzGp88qWYs
7. The second is fuzzier &amp; more difficult, but even more important. It is an unfortunate feature of the human brain/psyche that negative comments activate our emotions (our fight-or-flight instinct, ultimately) more than positive comments. They're like barbs that hook us.
6. Anyway, nobody pays me to tweet or to be here, so I have zero obligation to listen to a-holes, so these days, it's one-chance-only. Sometimes I even express opinions purposefully designed to elicit a-holes, just so I can block them. And it works! Twitter is now more pleasant.
5. It's not just MAGA types though. Axe grinders come in many shapes: the guy who's figured out that nuclear is the *obvious* solution to climate change &amp; everyone who disagrees is an idiot. The guy who thinks Clinton "stole the primary." Etc. (Usually guys, face it.)
4. For instance, I have never once encountered a MAGA tweeter who provided interesting new info or a reasonable argument. Not once. At least in my experience, they are *all* yelling slogans. And if they yell at you, they frequently tag in mobs to follow with more yelling.
3. With many (honestly, most) people, you can tell within a tweet whether they are here to discuss &amp; exchange information (or even argue &amp; dispute, respectfully), or whether they're just grinding an axe or looking at people to yell at.
2. The first is blocking MFers -- just blocking willy-nilly, at the drop of a hat. I used to have weird reservations about blocking people, as though I had some responsibility to allow a-holes to have their say on my feed. But there is no such responsibility.
1. Acknowledging the obvious background here -- that Twitter is a soul-draining swamp &amp; no one should ever tweet or even go to the website -- here are the only strategies I've ever found that actually improve my Twitter experience.

@seanhecht @BorensteinS I think the key insight is that macroeconomic trends affect prices much more than most design decisions -- and are difficult to predict. Another reason caps never hold.
Intense and necessary thread. https://t.co/OGhURXvbfH
@BillNPeters But they are expecting much more from cap&amp;trsde going forward.
All that said I still think Waxman-Markey was good and I will fight you.
And join that tax with an array of sector-specific regulations, large-scale public investments, supply restrictions, aggressive innovation, &amp; maybe a couple of big obvious hammers like banning the sale of new ICE vehicles by 2030. Monitor progress, update frequently. Amen. &lt;/fin&gt;
But that seems to be our value system for the time being, and if so, we should be transparent about it. We don't yet have the political will to enforce a cap, so why build the C&amp;T apparatus? Why pretend? Until we're really willing to enforce a cap, we should tax out in the open.
Choosing a tax over a cap implicitly prioritizes predictability, investor confidence, &amp; political stability over environmental outcomes. If you choose a tax, you cannot guarantee a carbon outcome -- you're guessing what level price will produce what emission reductions.
... is, effectively, a low and rising carbon tax. Prices are suppressed, they aren't allowed to swing, and the whole conceptual advantage of C&amp;T is lost. But if you find yourself running an administratively burdensome carbon tax, why not just ditch the apparatus &amp; tax directly?
What has mostly happened in practice - in the ETS, RGGI, &amp; CA - is that the system is oversupplied with cheap allowances, price collars get too tight &amp; too low, there's leakage, and prices end up at or near the price floor. What you end up with in that situation ...
Basically, to really do C&amp;T, you need to be willing to let prices swing: emissions approach the cap, prices go up, emissions level off. That's what gives the cap force. You can constrain price swings w/ price floors &amp; ceilings, but to the extent you do, you make it more tax-like.
My post today raises a difficult question. I've always preferred carbon caps to carbon taxes -- I'd rather have emissions certainty than price certainty. But it's looking like, in the real world, the very features that recommend cap&amp;trade systems are the ones blunted by politics.

It's not an insurmountable challenge, but it does illustrate why climate is such a "wicked problem," so difficult to address even relative to other social ills. The time scales involved just don't match human perception/emotion.
To be clear, this is not to say that climate policy has no immediate benefits. It can create jobs, stimulate economies, clean up local air pollution, fund resilience, etc. All that will happen in a time frame legible to the folks who vote for it. But the *climate* benefits? No.
... actions we take today will meliorate climate impacts in 20-30 years. So campaigners can say, "that hurricane that hit your home is why you should support climate leg," but they can't say, "if you pass climate leg, it will prevent hurricanes from hitting your home."

@TKavulla Perhaps it will sink in soon.
In some circumstances, being righteous, having history &amp; morality on your side, can help build power. But not in all circumstances. And the former is never a substitute for the latter. Good intentions only matter insofar as they enter the world as new policy or shifted norms.
Power, effectively deployed, is the only thing that has ever won a political battle. And there's no way to effectively deploy power without understanding the political economy you're operating in -- who has power (including how much you have, and what kind) &amp; how it's used.
Righteousness is no substitute for knowledge of political economy. 95% of the history of democracy is a history of good people with good plans losing. It's good to be good -- better than being bad! -- but in politics, being good gets you zero points.

From a political-economy POV, a tax that keeps lower income levels whole -- or even puts them ahead, as most equal-dividend programs would -- is less likely to produce political blowback, at least of the populist variety. But there are trade-offs with any of these design choices.
One reason a climate hawk might oppose a badly designed carbon tax, one that hits the poor hardest &amp; does nothing to offset the effects, is that the political blowback on such a tax will have the effect of slowing the larger decarbonization effort.
How high is the tax? How fast will it rise? Where in the carbon supply chain is it levied? How are trade-exposed industries protected? Most importantly, what's done with the revenue? Until these questions are answered, the words "carbon tax" tell you almost nothing.
It makes no sense to say, in isolation, that one is for or against "a carbon tax" (unless one is just interested in fighting factional identity-based battles on Twitter). The effects of a c-tax depend *entirely* on how its designed. https://t.co/AGONTa9fhd

@ElFeinste 2/2 Point is to show distribution of knowledge -- line stays almost flat until about 10% of people (i.e., most people know nothing), then curves up sharply. Maybe 1% of people at the top, true expertise.
@ElFeinste 1/2 It's so simple. Just a chart showing a logarithmic curve. Right-hand (vertical) axis: knowledge (from ignorance at bottom to expertise at top). Bottom (horizontal) axis: people, from 100% at left to 0% on right.

How do I know this? Because it's Not. A. Choice. It's not the result of a tactical assessment. It is simply nature of the right. There are no adults, no one to keep it in check or craft a message, no one to think strategically. It's a wounded, panicked, flailing animal.

... I spend a good portion of every day thinking about the fact that my 15yo is leaving in just 3 years &amp; trying not to bawl. Somehow I pre-miss him desperately. Every hug &amp; joke &amp; conversation feels like a gift these days -- I want to cling to all of it.
I have 13yo &amp; 15yo boys. I always kind of assumed that when they turned teen, they'd get smelly &amp; unpleasant &amp; I'd be ready for them to go when they turn 18. But at least so far, that is very much not what's happening. Instead ...

@umairfan @ElizHarball Yes -- the grayscale thing is the only thing I've ever tried that has worked.
@wikigamaliel Ha! A parable.
What's being referenced is not actual human liberals, but Liberals, a mythical creature created by conservative media, with bloody, slavering jaws &amp; a mind filled with perversions, somehow both omni-malevolent &amp; omni-incompetent, in league with all the world's evil forces.
(1/2) When you hear a conservative say "liberals do/think XYZ" &amp; you get confused, because you hang out with liberals all day &amp; have never encountered one that does/thinks XYZ, just remember:

... I think lots of them are kind of adrift, uncertain what to think or who to trust about climate change. It's an extremely fluid situation. A smart, strategic communicator from *within the conservative movement* could have a huge impact in these circumstances, IMO.
This comports with my (admittedly impressionistic &amp; anecdotal) sense of the state of play w/in the GOP. I think lots of Rs have realized that deniers like Trump are full of shit. But they *cannot* trust libs or lib-identified institutions like the Dem Party or the IPCC. So ...
One other note, on the crucial issue of trust. Dems trust the IPCC more than Trump, obviously. But note that Republicans are sharply divided on trust &amp; and fully 32% don't trust the IPCC *or* Trump. They don't know who to trust. https://t.co/4MHDxezPZW

@taitdl @TKavulla What Daniel said, and also, honestly, I'm fine with a little paternalism to get renewables growing faster. The stakes are pretty high.
@benserrurier @gilbeaq @TKavulla But they would have to restructure to allow that, no?

@erinoverturf Other than that I'm all over this story.
@gilbeaq Are Boulder's targets more stringent than the ones Xcel announced today, or are they in sync now?

7. And all that studying I did on the midterms? It ended up producing this piece, which you should still go back and read if you haven't: https://t.co/YULxOGFv2U
6. Anyway, I think the conversation was better for it -- more spontaneous &amp; improvisational &amp; almost certainly more interesting than it would have been if I'd had a bunch of pre-prepared stuff to say. Chris makes spontaneous conversation very, very easy (a real art).
5. Suffice to say, when one writes multi-thousand word articles on epistemology, one does not anticipate being asked to offer extensive additional remarks on the subject (so much as one anticipates being fired for poor web traffic).
4. Here, imagine a car-tire-screeching sound effect, as my brain lurches in a VERY different direction. After a few more Qs I realized, oh, we're really gonna spend the hour on this! Oh HELL yes. It was like a surprise Christmas gift.
3. I go into the radio booth carrying typed notes &amp; a head full of info about governors' races, how many legislatures are now run by Ds, the prospects for state climate legislation, &amp; the political dynamics of climate in 2018. Then Chris comes on. "Let's talk about epistemology."
2. When Chris's producer contacted me, it was right after the midterms &amp; I assumed that he wanted me on to talk about how climate/energy fared in the elections. (I probably should have, y'know, asked.) So I studied up on that. Like, a lot. Took notes &amp; everything.

4. That essay was about how climate change is so huge &amp; totalizing that everyone needs some keyhole through which to view it, some familiar, human-scale issue to attach it to, to make it digestible &amp; comprehensible. You just can't take in the totality all at once.

6. If Trump is reelected &amp; completes the hackification of the federal apparatus, the damage that he can do is going to radically expand, in both speed &amp; severity. We really haven't seen anything yet. &lt;/fin&gt;
5. The administration is working as fast as it can to staff the federal apparatus -- the agencies, the judiciary, foreign diplomats, etc. -- with hacks. It's an extremely large apparatus, so that takes a while. There's only so much you can do in four years. But in eight?
4. ... what you're hearing is echoes of Obama, the legacy of competent staffing. On one hand, this has severely restricted Trump's ability to screw things up. On the other hand, I worry it's given people an unduly optimistic perspective on what Trump is ultimately capable of.
3. So any time you read about, say, the US being helpful on some subquestion of int'l climate talks, or ARPA-E doing good things, or basic regulatory enforcement mechanisms still operating, or basic legal norms being enforced by district judges ...
2. To wit: many parts of the federal apparatus, especially at the middle &amp; lower levels, are still staffed by competent people of good will, hired by Obama. The functional bureaucracy Obama built over 8 years is still largely in place. That has limited the damage.
1. A quick thread, pivoting off my new piece. There have been lots of efforts, in various domains, to measure the damage done by Trump &amp; predict what damage he might do. There's a key fact to keep in mind when contemplating those subjects.
@daniellerch @RadioFreeTom I rambled at him for a while in the comments on that very thread.
@MilesFarmer @Rev4NY @NYSDPS That would require another 5,000 words, which would end with, "in conclusion, I dunno!"

My new post: The Paris climate agreement was designed to be flexible and resilient. Can it hold together in the face of Trump’s skullduggery? https://t.co/ZapaGgiDRf
@evidentialdread So technically we'd be out of the agreement for a few months. We could have to cough up a fresh NDC to get back in, I wonder, or would we just revert to the old one?
Hey International Climate Negotiations Twitter: the US cannot formally withdraw from Paris until Nov. 5, 2020 -- a few days after the presidential election. But even if he loses, Trump will still be president in Nov., yes? And he can still complete the withdrawal, yes? No?
It is amazing. Equally amazing: everyone involved will deny to their graves that it has anything to do with the fact that she's a young, female latina. It's just coincidence! https://t.co/sLYef4wGXY

@RadioFreeTom Also notable: a substantial bloc of the Prudence, Stoicism, &amp; Fiscal Responsibility party is composed of purely instrumental plutocratic greedheads. If that bloc were jettisoned &amp; only true fiscal conservatives were left, there'd be like a dozen (but you'd all have op-ed gigs.)
@RadioFreeTom It's possible that the Prudence, Stoicism, &amp; Fiscal Responsibility party and the Resentful Xenophobe party hooked up not by accident but because that's the only way the former could ever get enough votes.
@RadioFreeTom If I were in your shoes, I would be thinking about how much electoral juice prudence, stoicism, &amp; fiscal responsibility have once you strip them of white resentment. How many people were really in it for that aspect of conservatism? Current evidence suggests: very few.
@RadioFreeTom Sorry, that's too simple. Put it this way: US conservatism got as far as it did because resentful whites (both working class AND suburbanites) saw that the small gov't/low tax/foreign belligerence agenda, in practice, aligned with protecting white power.
@RadioFreeTom I agree with most of this, except I think the most difficult thing for you (Boot, Rubin, et al) to come to terms with is that, in terms of intensity, the US right has always been racist. That's what motivated the ground troops, not prudence, stoicism, &amp; fiscal responsibility.

Living in the narrow, unhealthy, unsustainable tranche of options granted us by a corporate oligarchy: normal; "the market." 		Trying to open up healthier choices: radical; "social engineering."
The idea that unwinding some of those subsidies, favoring the suburbs less, is "herding people into cities" is not just wrong, it's pathetic. It's taking a lifestyle foisted on you by corporations &amp; pretending it's "Real America," like Wal-Mart wants.
The suburbs were not an immaculate conception, born of the pure free market &amp; unencumbered consumer choices. People were herded to the suburbs by public policy. They eat shit processed food because of public policy. They drive enormous f'ing tanks because of public policy.
Every bit of people's lives in America -- how their communities &amp; homes are structured, what they eat, their entertainment &amp; consumer choices -- is a result of "social engineering," ie, choices made by policymakers.
I wish people would stop treating this as a conscious strategic choice. Like Trump himself, the GOP as become pure creature of myopic tribal resentments. It is what it is; it could not choose to be otherwise. https://t.co/ZrVYumlx0M

I've been thinking abou this. The climate movement focuses on oil companies, but the main reason we use so much oil is that we've designed land use to require it &amp; allowed car companies to build co2-intensive cars. Cars, not oil in the abstract, are the right focus. https://t.co/RRkXfxQ3v9

@nickjuliano Yes, though I'm not convinced that was ever a real choice.
@busbyj2 I can't believe I didn't think of that.
14. The Democratic Party is moving left on climate change. So is the American public. Manchin is moving in the opposite direction, as his state clings desperately to coal. If Senate Dems care a shred about climate change: Anyone but Manchin. &lt;/fin&gt; https://t.co/V1k3zdD6gm
13. The Senate matters. If Dems take the presidency, Senate, &amp; House in 2020 (not outside the realm of the possible) and Manchin runs the Senate committee where climate legislation is written, all hopes of a Green New Deal are forlorn. He will shoot them down, possibly literally.
12. I remember in 2008, climate hawks were so excited about Obama &amp; his cabinet, so excited about the House ... and just kind of forgot about the Senate. But the Senate is where all their dreams went to die. https://t.co/HtulEYjggw https://t.co/iPt1AFSv9o
11. Cantwell could stay. Bernie could move beyond a life of campaigns &amp; message bills &amp; actually get some work done on climate. Schumer could bypass the seniority system &amp; simply skip over Manchin to the next in line, Martin Heinrich (NM), who would be great. Anyone but Manchin.
10. It will be an utter betrayal if Senate Dems allow their most important climate-policy committee to fall into the hands of their single most climate-hostile member. I can't figure out why climate activists aren't up in arms about this. It could happen as soon as tomorrow!
9. Next in line after Sanders is Debbie Stabenow (MI), but she is ranking member on Ag, which writes the Farm Bill -- a powerful spot, significant for her state. So she'll stay put. And next after her? Manchin. The guy who shoots climate bills.
8. But it appears Sanders intends to keep his slot on the Budget Cmte, even if it means Manchin gets ENR. After all, ENR is a lot of work &amp; Sanders has a presidential campaign to run. https://t.co/XQKxZ08ABL
7. Sanders has been making lots of noise about climate change lately, issuing ambitious policy ideas. He's hosting a big televised town hall about it on Monday. Taking top spot on ENR would be a way for him to really get his hands dirty &amp; do the work. https://t.co/pOWJYSvvJW
6. Sen. Maria Cantwell (WA), who is now ranking on ENR, is expected to move over &amp; become chair of Commerce. Who will take her place? Next ranking member on ENR is Wyden (OR), but he chairs Finance &amp; wants to keep it. After him comes a young fellow named Bernard Sanders.
5. What's going on? Well, Senate cmte appointments generally run on seniority. The gavel falls to the next most senior member (as long as they don't run another cmte -- can't run two). Sen. Bill Nelson (Fla) lost this year; he was ranking member in Commerce. So ...
4. Manchin, you will recall, literally shot the last climate bill that came out of the House -- and that bill was a fraction as ambitious as what climate activists want out of the House today. He is the single worst Senate Dem on this issue. https://t.co/65fnMKPAy2
3. I can't think of a single thing Senate Dems could do more likely to crush the bright new climate ambition in the House than having Manchin as chair of ENR. ENR is likely where climate legislation will happen in the Senate &amp; the chair is the one who writes legislation.
2. Long story short: it looks like Sen. Joe Manchin (WV) may become the ranking member of the Energy &amp; Natural Resources Committee. If that happens, he'd become chair of the cmte when/if Dems take the Senate in 2020. That would be a DISASTER for climate policy.
1. There's an extremely important climate-policy story going on in the Senate right now &amp; it's not getting enough attention. Everyone's focused on the House &amp; the Green New Deal, but the Senate is where dreams go to die, especially if this goes the wrong way.

@SimonWDC Coincidentally, also the name of my metal album.
13. If you're like me, you probably can't help thinking that there must be more to it, something deeper than Ben Shapiros. But I've looked, and if there is, they're keeping it well under wraps. I'm afraid it's Shapiros all the way down. &lt;/fin&gt;
12. ... are objectively more credible than others just seems to have faded out entirely. The right has been flattened, homogenized into one big sea of Fox dittoheads -- *even at the highest levels of government*.
11. ... that would be the place to invoke it! But instead it's glib, contextless factoids from the Daily friggin' Caller. And I bet nobody at EPA leadership thought anything of it. It's all tribal epistemology now, their side &amp; our side. The notion that some people ...
10. Think about it. The EPA administrator has access to anyone -- he could call on any scientist in the world. If there are smart people writing serious critiques of NCA4, he could find them. If the right had a coherent, developed alternative to mainstream climate science ...
9. Thus (to return to the beginning of the thread), when the hacks at EPA want to cast doubt on a climate assessment from gov't scientists, they cite ... the hacks at the Daily Caller. That's all there is!
8. It's slogans all the way down now. There are still a few serious scholars/researchers floating around on that side, but they're not needed. There's no demand for their services any more. Ben Shapiro is the level of "thinker" they want/need.
7. ... have almost entirely crumbled. Over the last several decades, hackery has taken over the entire apparatus. The academics are hacks, the think tank folks are hacks, the media is hacks, even the president -- they're all the *same kind of hack*, echoing the same slogans.
6. ... surely, somewhere, behind the scenes, some conservative in a think tank or something had written the intellectually creditable version. I really, really believed this. It took a long time for me to let it go. But the fact is, the intellectual underpinnings of the right...
5. When I started paying attention to &amp; covering politics, for the longest time, I assumed the same was true of the right (in part because I, like many noobs, was gripped by the background assumption that the sides are symmetrical). Yeah, their slogans were super-dumb, but ...
4. The main point being, if you encounter a slogan from a leftie, say, "Medicare for All," you can be relatively confident that, somewhere, someone has written the 200-page, heavily footnoted version of it. There is depth behind the slogan, thinkers behind the activists.
3. And increasingly (thanks in no small part to the efforts of Wonkblog/Vox founder Ezra Klein) there's a kind of middle tier of, for lack of a better term, explainers -- deeper in the weeds than the activists, but still aimed at the popular public, unlike the true nerds.
2. At the front there are advocates &amp; activists, deliver the sort of slogan version. At the back there are serious scholars -- academics &amp; think-tank types who do the studies, know the history, &amp; can deliver the full-meal-deal version.
1. It's too late in the day for a thread, but a quick one nonetheless, about the above 👆. I remember when I first started covering politics, I learned that there was a kind of structure to the left, in terms of policy thinking.

@Noahpinion 2/2 There are many versions of that argument. If you cared to engage, what I'd recommend is seeking out the strongest versions. Dismissing it (&amp; conflating it with climate activism generally) based on stray Twitter comments and WSJ op-eds is not good intellectual practice.

"Sure, I agree the climate is warming and cutting back on emissions is urgently necessary, like they've been saying for years, but unlike them, I don't think we should kill puppies to do it!" Yeah, okay man.

@sethdmichaels @jgkoomey @Noahpinion "My opponents may say [waves hands at arguments I'm too lazy to understand or engage], but what they really mean is [absurd, easily debunked caricature]!" Makes arguing way easier.
@Noahpinion How about a simple heuristic: do not trust right-wingers to accurately describe the motivations or ideologies of people on the left. The article deals entirely in ludicrous caricatures. "Climate change is a great pretext to destroy human abundance, bwa ha ha!" I mean really?

My older brother had it before me. When I was 14, he would wake me up at midnight to help him push it out of the driveway so he could start it down the street a ways. He'd sneak out to see his girlfriend. He had an actual mattress in the back, which, now that I'm thinking, ew.
My first-ever car was a 1972 Pontiac LeMans station wagon, in bright yellow. We called it The Banana. It was about 50 feet long, the doors were a good foot thick, and it had a third-row seat that faced backwards &amp; that kind of power steering that you can steer with your pinkie.
All I want is an electric station wagon. With old-school station-wagon styling. Maybe faux wood side panels.

Do my fellow oldsters remember that? In the run-up to the Iraq War? People who tried to go beyond the comic-book slogans supporting the war were accused of nuance, as though it's a character flaw. "Nuance." They used to spit the word with utter contempt.
The right has had this "my gut is smarter than your brain" philosophy for a long while, but they used to try to dress it up as "moral clarity" or a courageous resistance to "nuance." Trust Trump just to say the quiet part loud.

@rcollier Not unless Schumer scraps the filibuster.
@CleanGridView @TheEnergyGang 💚
But you compromise from a position of strength, from a clear &amp; unapologetic vision. You don't LEAD with compromise, not when there's no good-faith negotiating partner. Anyway. I hope D leadership gets this, but of course they don't, because darkest timeline etc. etc.
There is no point, nothing to be gained, by *compromising in a symbolic messaging bill*. That's just a category error. Now, if Ds take the presidency &amp; both houses &amp; legislation becomes a possibility, fine: THEN you start compromising, working backward from the grand vision.
For instance, on this Green New Deal stuff: just go for it! It isn't about a bill that can pass this Congress. It isn't about a bill that can pass at all. (Again: no bill can.) It's about saying to voters: this is what we would do if Rs weren't stopping us.
But letting it go is crucial. Because once the chimera of bipartisan cooperation is abandoned, the strategic imperative is clear: go hard. On both sides. Go hard on investigations &amp; accountability. And go hard on big, visionary symbolism. Do not rein either in hoping for comity.
Letting go of any hope of legislation will be difficult for Schumer &amp; his ilk, who define themselves as clever negotiators &amp; dealmakers. They still have not internalized that Trump is not a rational interlocutor -- that he's both uninterested in &amp; incapable of compromising.
What they *shouldn't* waste any time on is trying to make clever deals to pass actual bipartisan legislation, like Schumer is already doing on the wall. There is ZERO substantive or political gain to be had in that futile effort. It's the worst of all worlds.
So there are two things they can be doing. They can be using subpoenas, hearings, etc. to investigate &amp; delay Trump's corrupt deregulatory agenda. And they can be putting together symbolic bills, meant to signal to voters what they'd get if they put Ds in power.
Seems to me Dems should go into this next Congress understanding that there will be no cooperation &amp; no legislation. Even on something like infrastructure, where there's a germ of bipartisan agreement, the GOP is simply incapable of getting its sh*t together. That's baseline.

10. As climate policy, it's a joke. But Rs know all too well that they don't need serious policy -- they just need enough BS to get through a single Chuck Todd question, because that's as deep as the MSM will ever dig. Thus, "innovation." &lt;/fin&gt;
9. Anyway, to sum up: when Rs respond to questions about climate policy by saying "innovation," what they mean is, "don't take any money from corporations, or require anything of corporations, just subsidize corporations." That's it.
8. Suffice to say, in the real world, the policies that best stimulate innovation are market-shaping policies -- mandates, performance standards, pollution pricing -- i.e., precisely the kind of policies the GOP opposes. https://t.co/CmJBYnrHMT
7. Suffice to say, there is not a serious climate policy analyst on Earth who thinks we can pull off a massive, rapid energy transition by sporadically subsidizing the research efforts of private companies -- even if such subsidies were intelligently allocated.
6. That's the GOP position: do not charge or otherwise penalize companies when they pollute; instead, lavish them with subsidies to reward their, ahem, innovations. So, for instance, GOP pols want to give coal companies a bunch of $$$ to fund efforts to bury carbon emissions.
5. But the GOP is under political pressure to come up with *some* policy on climate. They can't penalize or restrict fossil fuel companies. So how about ... giving fossil fuel companies money? You could call it "incentives" or "prizes" for innovation! Perfect.
4. The way to understand what GOP means by it is to start with basics. The current GOP is an alliance of plutocrats &amp; racists. The plutocrats don't want any policy that constrains or penalizes big business generally, &amp; fossil fuels specifically. That is the fixed point.
3. Needless to say, the GOP position has no connection at all to the longstanding debate on innovation in energy. They mean something else by it.
2. Innovation is great. Literally no one is against it. It's one of the most important (and least understood) concepts in economics. We have a rough sense of how to stimulate innovation. There are lots of ways: public R&amp;D, performance standards, pricing mechanisms.
1. A quick word on the current "moderate" GOP stance on climate change, i.e., that we should depend on "innovation" rather than hurting the economy. (Sasse &amp; Rubio &amp; others are out saying this right now.) It's code. Here's what it means.

RW media has allowed the political commitments to completely swamp any respect for transpartisan norms. The rest of the media world, whatever its frequent failures &amp; flaws, still clings to the norms. That's the difference, and it *matters*. A lot.
One additional note: I don't actually think there's anything wrong with journalists having a perspective, or opinions, or even being generally aligned with one side or the other. The question is which takes priority: journalistic norms or political commitments.
If journalists, seeking to avoid "taking sides," allow the RW to whatabout this, to blur the difference between journalism &amp; propaganda, they are only hurting themselves &amp; their vocation. Anyway blah blah I've said it all before: https://t.co/ByZyLOpvF5
Fairness, accuracy, skepticism -- these values transcend tribe. They are not right or left. It's time for journalism to defend itself, which begins by stating clearly that journalism matters &amp; that Fox &amp; RW media are *not journalism* as traditionally understood.
That is the distinction the right's whataboutism is meant to erase. They want everyone &amp; everything to be on one side or the other; it's literally the only way they can process the world. But other journalists should not be bullied into the same perspective.
But journalists outside the right-wing bubble DO believe in transpartisan principles &amp; norms. They DO believe in facts, not just right-facts or left-facts. Of course they are human &amp; subject to bias &amp; blindspots like anyone, but they respect an ideal beyond tribal advantage.
Cons think other media are like Fox because they do not acknowledge the possibility of norms, procedures, &amp; truths that transcend tribe, that apply to all tribes equally. They are blind to the possibility, so they can *only* process non-right perspectives as left.
Sorry, no matter how automatic &amp; ingrained the whataboutism, CNN &amp; MSNBC are not the same -- not in degree, not in kind. Mainstream media &amp; conservative media are not parallel. They are not involved in the same pursuit. Refusing to say so is what's allowed this shit to happen.
