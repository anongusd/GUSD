There's so much more to say about Medicare for America. Looking forward to the robust debate and sharing more about the plan as we (w/ @janschakowsky) get ready to reintroduce it this Congress.
On employer-sponsored insurance: some people love theirs, others don’t. Our solution: if employers offer gold level coverage, great! If not, they either have to or they can put their employees on #Med4America and make a contribution. And workers can always choose #Med4America.
It also tackles the Hyde Amendment. Under #Med4America we ensure all reproductive health care is covered. We're also able to end Hyde-like riders for the Indian Health Service, women's veterans healthcare, and health care in ICE detention facilities.
#Med4America also includes Long-Term Services &amp; Supports as a part of the universal service package. We cannot have a conversation about universal coverage if we do not include robust home and community-based LTSS.
Like its benefits package. Healthcare should not be determined by your zip code. Unfortunately in our current system it is. #Med4America sets a high threshold for benefits so that all Americans get the same covered benefits and services.

.@HouseDemocrats have laid out a reasonable path forward to reopen the government—one that is supported Members of Congress in both chambers and both parties. This manufactured crisis has gone on long enough.
The federal government plays a key role in people’s everyday lives, and President Trump has selfishly put people’s livelihoods at risk in order to score political points. It is time for President Trump to end his shutdown.
Hundreds of thousands of federal workers and contractors—many of whom are living paycheck to paycheck—are furloughed or working without pay. Routine food safety inspections have been halted, and the list goes on.
Americans desperately want to end this shutdown. As we enter its third week, critical food assistance is at risk for our most vulnerable citizens—including children, seniors, and veterans.
Tonight, President Trump doubled down on heated rhetoric and lies regarding his manufactured crisis at the border. Instead of governing responsibly, he has taken our government hostage in order to make good on an empty campaign slogan. That is unacceptable.

The Administration’s own data shows millions of Americans will be at risk of going hungry and cut SNAP by billions of dollars. Instead of listening to the will of the American people, Secretary Purdue has decided to jam through a regulation that punishes people for being poor.
The USDA proposal betrays decades of bipartisan support for SNAP. The President's cruelty couldn't be clearer: passing trillions in tax cuts for billionaires &amp; corporations with massive giveaways to corporate agribusinesses—while taking food assistance away from the unemployed.
From exorbitant premiums and deductibles to skimpy plans that do not cover the essentials, healthcare in America is complex and costly. An individual’s zip code should not determine their benefits. Every American deserves coverage they can afford and that meets their needs.
This bill achieves universal coverage while preserving quality employer-sponsored insurance for those who have it and are satisfied. Americans who are uninsured or do not have employer-sponsored insurance would be auto-enrolled into Medicare for America.
Medicare for America also includes coverage for prescription drugs, dental, vision, and hearing services, as well as long-term supports and services for seniors and Americans living with disabilities.

Meals on Wheels is a lifeline for seniors. But it's about more than just a warm meal—it's about making sure seniors can live with dignity. With growing need year after year, Congress must increase funding to ensure it reaches as many seniors as possible. https://t.co/6Luhzh2j6c

I can’t say I’m surprised that the President’s proposals are just another gift to Big Pharma. I will continue to fight lower prices, and stop the price gouging.
My bill would protect consumers from misinformation and advertising that promotes unnecessarily expensive prescription drugs
Finally, I’ve introduced the Responsibility in Drug Advertising Act that places a three-year ban on direct-to-consumer advertising of newly approved prescription drugs.
I’ve also long supported the Affordable and Safe Prescription Drug Importation Act, which would allow individuals and pharmacies to buy drugs from other countries that are equally as safe as drugs sold here, but significantly more affordable.
My bill would give the government the authority to regulate the price of prescription drugs and ensure no American’s health is threatened by corporations who put profits above people.
This week, I introduced the Prescription Drug and Medical Device Price Review Board Act, which prevents drug and medical device companies from gouging consumers with excessive prices.
The President should have kept his promise and allowed Medicare to negotiate to lower drug prices. I’m proud to be a cosponsor of the Medicare Prescription Drug Price Negotiation Act, which would help our seniors.
President Trump’s prescription drug price proposal fails to truly tackle the exorbitant costs that millions of hard-working individuals and families are struggling with.

If they want to fix our nation’s growing deficits, they could easily find the money by eliminating outrageous tax breaks for millionaires and billionaires, rather than taking money away from working families.

#PaycheckFairnessAct is only part of the solution for #EqualPay, but we also need #paidsickdays, #paidleave, affordable #childcare &amp; to #raisethewage to close the wage gap.
On average, women are paid just 80 cents for every $1 paid to their male counterparts. For women of color, the #wagegap is much larger. #EqualPayDay #talkpay https://t.co/7IeT5V3ovK
In every Congress since 1997 I have introduced the #PaycheckFairnessAct. This act would help close the #wagegap by giving workers stronger tools to combat wage discrimination.
Today is #EqualPayDay — the day that the average woman’s pay finally catches up to what the average man made last year. We need to act now to close the #wagegap and ensure women receive equal pay for equal work. https://t.co/hezzDBLWXB

That is why we need to pass the FAMILY Act to set up a national program that provides workers with 12 weeks of paid leave per year for the birth or adoption of a new child, recovery from a serious illness, or caring for a seriously ill family member. Now is the time. #FMLA25
So as we commemorate 25 years of FMLA, we must continue to push for meaningful paid family leave policy. #PaidLeaveMeans that American workers are not pushed off a financial edge when they need to care for their themselves or their responsibilities at home. #FMLA25
Unfortunately, 41 percent of workers don’t have access to leave under FMLA. 5 in 6 worksites are not covered by FMLA. And FMLA only offers unpaid leave. This needs to change.
Over the past 25 years, American workers have used FMLA more than 200 million times in times of need. To take care of a family member, recover from a serious illness, or welcome a new child home. #FMLA25

The U.S. has made remarkable progress on LGBTQ rights, but we have more work to do. On #Pride2017 we reaffirm our commitment to equality.
@realDonaldTrump We have a remarkable opportunity to address one of the most serious man-made issues of our time &amp; protect our planet, but we must act now.
@realDonaldTrump I strongly urge @realDonaldTrump to reconsider this decision and make the right choice for our children and grandchildren #ParisAgreement
@realDonaldTrump With this decision, @realDonaldTrump &amp; his climate-denying advisors continue an assault on science &amp; the environment https://t.co/5h0CfXoQKt
@realDonaldTrump More than 190 countries agree that climate change is real and it is disappointing that @realDonaldTrump is choosing to sit on the sidelines.
.@realDonaldTrump's decision to pull the US out of the Paris Agreement will roll back years of progress in our fight against climate change.
We must always remember the brave men and women who made the ultimate sacrifice to ensure the freedoms we have today. #MemorialDay

Great to have so many people from across Connecticut calling into the #DeLauroTownHall! Look forward to continuing the conversation. https://t.co/sM6lRiyHD1
Thanks for joining and I look forward to continuing the conversation! https://t.co/2HAai7TpnJ
Block granting Medicaid is the wrong path forward and will only put more Americans at risk of losing coverage. #DeLauroTownHall
Repealing Medicaid expansion would rip coverage away from more than a million individuals with substance use disorders #DeLauroTownHall
Mental health is one of the essential services in the ACA and repealing it would remove access to critical programs. #DeLauroTownHall
Deborah in Woodbridge is concerned about access to mental health services with the future of the Affordable Care Act. #DeLauroTownHall
Ron: The Trump Administration suppressing enrollment is affecting younger Americans the most and it's a serious problem. #DeLauroTownHall
We not only need younger and healthier Americans to enroll through the ACA, we need the GOP to stop undermining enrollment #DeLauroTownHall
Holly in Wallingford has a great question about getting younger Americans into our health insurance system #DeLauroTownHall
To address the skyrocketing cost of prescription drugs, I've introduced a bill to create a drug price review board. https://t.co/o6W5rgZcD0
The pharmaceutical industry has prohibited Congress from negotiating the price of prescription drugs and that is wrong. #DeLauroTownHall
Thank you to Alice in Milford for asking about the high prices of drugs for Americans on Medicare and the donut hole. #DeLauroTownHall
As someone who has insurance through the ACA and is a cancer survivor, covering pre-existing conditions is critical to me #DeLauroTownHall
Republicans have not presented a plan on how we can keep people with pre-existing conditions insured if they repeal the ACA #DeLauroTownHall
The ACA meant insurers can no longer tell Americans 'I'm sorry, you can't get insurance b/c of a pre-existing condition.' #DeLauroTownHall
With premiums and deductibles putting a strain on families, the ACA is not perfect. We still have more work to do. #DeLauroTownHall
Repealing the ACA would give the 400 highest income families in the U.S. an average tax cut of $7 million a year. #DeLauroTownHall
If we move foward with repealing the Affordable Care Act, we lose all the reforms and progress we have made. #DeLauroTownHall
The ACA brought critical change and reform to our healthcare system, like ending discrimination on preexisting conditions. #DeLauroTownHall
Thank you to Ron Pollack, the Founding Executive Director of Families USA, for joining me on tonight's #DeLauroTownHall on health care.
Just under 25 minutes until my tele-town hall on the Affordable Care Act. To join, text ROSA to 828282 and use #DeLauroTownHall on Twitter.

That’s why I introduced the Recall Unsafe Drugs Act to give the FDA mandatory recall authority over deadly drugs. https://t.co/dUwalx9NvE

Gorsuch threatens to undo years of progress on health care, the environment, women's health, immigration, labor, gay rights, &amp; civil rights.
