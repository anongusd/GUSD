The ref was out of his tree tonight. The decision not to give Kimpembe a second yellow was an admission from the ref that he'd lost the plot with all the yellow cards in the first half. #UnitedReview

The danger inherent in this new M.O. from all segments of the American Left is the level of resentment it can and will build among the majority of Americans not living in the cultural epicenters of the Left. If it happens quickly enough, expect 6 more years of Trump. /fin
When a level-headed man can't thumb through an issue of GENTLEMAN's Quarterly without nearly the entire magazine reading like it's an issue of The Atlantic but with highly polished fashion spreads and celebrity worship. Resentment can creep in. /11
Yet this just isn't GQ. The same thing is happening at analogous women's magazine websites as well. The culture of periodical entertainment has shifted into SJW/Intersectionality-above-all-else territory, which doesn't come without consequence. /10
And those are just the DEPICTIONS on the top of the homepage. If you just read the headlines alone, you may think you've confused https://t.co/cIVRO1kieA for https://t.co/OGnJvqyBEJ among your browser tabs. /9
Take the current homepage of https://t.co/cIVRO1kieA right now as an example of what I am talking about. There are three depictions of white men. 1. One getting roughed up by a rapper's security detail. 2. A picture of Mitch McConnell in a hit piece. 3. Smollett's attackers /8
The first, small-ish cultural example that comes to mind is the complete 180-degree shift from a color/culture-blind editorial direction in popular periodicals to one that could best be described as heavy-handed affirmative action, in an effort to combat "white privilege." /7
Yet within days of taking back control of the House, Democrats moved to pass several pieces of gun control legislation including an "Assault Weapons Ban" that would make it virtually illegal to own most semi-automatic firearms. A majority of the US doesn't support banning them /6
Another large overreaction was to the tenor of the 2018 midterm elections as it related to guns. Almost all critical thinkers viewed the election results to be almost exclusively about President Trump. While there were some gun control votes, they didn't constitute a majority. /5
Instead, Kavanaugh's appointment by the Senate has resulted in states PREEMPTING a potential overturning of Roe, by codifying infanticide, which the Court has ruled the banning of as constitutional. The result? What happened in Gosnell's clinics is now permitted in New York. /4
Brett Kavanaugh was essentially hand-picked by Justice Kennedy, who Kavanaugh would be replacing. One would think that such an endorsement might indicate the continued longevity of the Roe v. Wade precedent. But NO(!) because that would require critical, nuanced understanding. /3
Example 1: The New York "women's health" legislation that essentially legalizes infanticide along with all of the legislation mimicking it in other states, is a blatantly reflexive overreaction to the appointment of Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court. /2
I'm convinced that everything happening within culture and politics today is a reflexive over-reaction to some perceived slight by the other side. The examples range from maximum exposure to interpersonal interactions with people/content. /1

@erikaho111 I didn't mean to contend that you were a partisan in the Political Party sense, but you clearly appear to be in partisan support for a highly regulated-if-not-virtually-controlled economic system akin to Marxism.
@erikaho111 Taken on face value, without any historical context, this is true. I am not a fan of OWH, and the subsequent case US v. Darby destroyed the 10th Amendment.
@erikaho111 I would add emphasis on "historical context" because at the time running massive deficits wasn't a thing, and that's why I would have been in favor of a Keynesian solution THEN, in the early 1930s, but would not be now.
@erikaho111 The GR didn't become "Great" until the aforementioned policies of FDR were pursued. There was a conflict of historical context between how to address the 1929 downturn. I align (unsurprisingly) with the monetarist view, but think SOME Keynesian mechanisms would have helped.

@erikaho111 You could say both sides have borrowed bits and pieces of Supply Side and Keynesian Economics to ill-effect. But to say that you're not partisan (as it relates to this issue) seems laughable given the evidence to the contrary.
@erikaho111 What place is that, exactly? It was Dodd-Frank, a Democrat piece of legislation that CODIFIED too big to fail.
@erikaho111 I'm flabbergasted by your reading of history.  FDR mistakenly believed competition caused the Great Depression. So he signed NIRA to stagnate competition. It resulted in insane wage and price increases (25% above norm), which is NOT consistent with economic depression.

@erikaho111 Nope! I think I conflated the end of my response and the beginning of my response. What I meant to suggest is that the individual has a choice, and the choices he or she makes might result in some inequality, but to blame that on the system is devoid of a fair observation.

I hope that @NoahCRothman's book touches on just how imperative the 2012 election results were to the state of our politics and political rhetoric is today. I'm sure he's at least touched on it, but I do believe an entire book could be written on this and this alone. /FIN
Instead, Obama's victory gave rise to more regulations that continued to cripple blue-collar industries, and his full embrace of far-left dogmas both political and rhetorical created the space for Trump to garner a following. /7
That growth, combined with zero tariffs would have kept the rising tide of populism in blue-collar America at a muted scream, and thus, Trump would have had no platform. /6
A President Romney would likely have reacted to the Supreme Court case upholding same-sex marriage with his usual temperance. He'd have begun the standard Republican policy dogmas (massive cuts in regulations/taxes) that spawned the growth we've seen the past 18 months.../5
One could argue that he could have used his second term to provide a check on the runaway rhetoric and actions of his far-Left base. He chose to (largely) embrace much of it, and I firmly believe this lead to the inevitability and flourish of the Trump candidacy. /4
And it did not fade like it had after he lost his control of Congress in 2010. Re-elected, Obama had nothing to lose, and he acted like it.  Fully embracing the new culture wars of the Left which were buoyed by several Supreme Court decisions during his second term. /3
While the divisive nature of our politics predated Obama's first term, it did not devolve into the utter shit show that is now being heaped upon, until his second term played out. 		Obama's resolve to fight conservatives/Republicans was strengthened by his re-election. /2
With all the hullabaloo about @MittRomney op-ed, today is a good day to remind everyone what a massive political mistake (from which it may never fully recover) re-electing Barack Obama over Mitt Romney was in 2012.  /1

@KevinMcMahonNFL I think he‚Äôs more of a traditional QB than Bridgewater but I saw nothing (against good teams) to lead me to believe he will ever be close to being a value for his contract. Bridgewater at Bridgewater money gets us to 8-7-1 at least this season.

The 2016 culling of the Brownback supporters he worked to elect to the Statehouse in 2012 came largely in Johnson County, where Democrats switched party ID to vote for the more "moderate" candidates in the GOP primary. This was really a return to the norm. https://t.co/xWQHaZPGF9

That's why part of me believes this game is MUCH bigger than the most hopeful/green #Vikings fan thinks it is. If they manage to beat the Seahawks, the belief in that locker room goes sky high. But I believe a loss could derail their season entirely.
While the defense is going to have to play well in Seattle, the game on MNF is exactly the sort of game in which Cousins needs to prove the #Vikings hopes and expectations via their $84M contract offer.
He went 29-38/342/3-0 against Green Bay. The first time he got a W when playing close to value for his contract. 		With what was a virtually guaranteed loss in NE last weekend, we're right back where we were with Cousins before the #Vikings game at home to Green Bay.
If not for the kicking fiasco in Green Bay, the #Vikings would stand at 7-5, but two of those losses would ultimately be on Kirk Cousins. 		I wrote a huge, multi-tweet diatribe about Cousins not presenting anything close to value for his contract before the Green Bay game.
The #Vikings are in a position where 4 wins COULD mean a home playoff game and 3 wins could mean missing the playoffs. 		I had them at 8-4 through this many games when their 2018 schedule first came out, and had them finishing at 11-5 with 12-4 being a ceiling, and a 10-6 floor.

@PFF_Sam I also think, in both instances, if the safeties were of Pro-Bowl quality, they'd be able to make a play without a targeting-type personal foul. Particularly on the second one, he could have hit Thielen with a form tackle and knocked the ball loose, but he was playing the ball.
@PFF_Sam FWIW, I think the rule change GREATLY affected the #MinneapolisMiracle play.
@PFF_Sam On the second one, the safety is looking at the ball the entire time he's approaching Thielen/the ball. It looks like he's trying to catch what he thinks is going to be an overthrow, his eyes never leave the ball, and his hands are in position to make the catch once he arrives.
@PFF_Sam Eh. I think on the first play the safety's intent was to blow the play up. He tucks his chin for a moment even (as to deliver a blow). But in a split second he realizes his hit is going to take out his CB, not Thielen and he jumps out of the way of his CB. Bad angle.

The #Vikings SHOULD finish the season at 10-5-1, but I also think that's their ceiling and getting there is going to primarily be on Cousins playing at a value for his contract. If he doesn't bring value in the final six games, the Vikings could miss the playoffs. /10 FIN
But my biggest fear as a #Vikings fan as it relates to Cousins is that he will be the reason the team loses one of the final three games, all of which should be wins, based on quality of the competition and the context of their seasons on game day. /9
All that I've just said about Cousins not providing value at $28M through ten games can go out the window if he can be the reason the #Vikings beat Green Bay, and be the reason for a win in either New England or Seattle. And I think the Vikes go 2-1 in those games. /8
Yet, the loss to BUF was on Cousins. He had a "deer in the headlights" look about him that day, and he did again last Sunday night. I think if he plays at the level he played against Arizona or Detroit, against Buffalo and Chicago, the #Vikings are 7-2-1 right now  /7
This thread is largely a response to Cousins smugly dismissing the legitimate criticism that he has not provided value at $28M/year. I think the #Vikings have only gotten a complete game out of him twice (GB and LAR), and I think he plays his best when he's the focus on "O" /6
To me the win at the Jets is a "push" in terms of Cousins meting his $28M value through 10 games with the #Vikings because a stellar afternoon in the running game dwarfed the need for Cousins. That said, his late TD was probably one of the five best pass completions of the year/5
In the wins against: SF - he had nothing in the second half. | Arizona - three consecutive 4th Quarter three-and-outs. | Detroit - The only second half possession that went into DET territory for the #Vikings, was a Cousins fumble. /4
I don't want to fault him for not being a contributing factor in four #Vikings wins, either. But when looked at on a game-by-game basis, it is Cousins who has not produced in moments in those games that kept the outcome in the balance. /3
Obviously this means the #Vikings have had a better record in games where he has not produced at value (3-2), but in those two losses he was the contributing factor in the loss (6 TO and an A/YA of &lt;5.00 vs. Buffalo and Chicago). /2
At $28M a year, the #Vikings QB cannot be the reason the team is losing games. By my calculation, Cousins has been a value at $28M/year in 4 of 10 games so far this season, and the Vikings' record in those games is 1-2-1 (GB, Rams, Eagles, Saints). /1
Not a good look. It's snarky, and Cousins talks past the fact that he is the highest paid QB and is not delivering value at the moment. He's not being criticized for how much he makes, he's being criticized for not producing value @ $84M. Tom Brady is worth Cousins' money. https://t.co/hxYqbrJJqa

Yet in all likelihood, this will still occur (on the intellectual Left) should the House pickups for Democrats number less than net-35.
I think it's fair to say that should the unthinkable happen today (again 80% chance it doesn't), Trump will have so fucked with the Democratic party and their base, that those on the "intellectual Left" will allow the full mind-fuck of the base to creep into their thinking. /5
Liberal people take longer to "settle down" and when they have kids they have one. Meanwhile, generally conservative people settle down something close to like 5 years earlier (on average) have kids sooner and have more kids in general, while living in red states. /4
This isn't palatable to the people who need to move, and thus it won't even be mentioned by people like Ezra Klein or Nate Silver. Instead they'll latch on to changing the system, which won't come to fruition for at least another 50 years, and even then is unlikely because.../3
Want to know how to get the Democratic Party to a modern version of mid-20th century? Young liberal yuppies will need to move to the suburbs and ex-urbs BEFORE meeting a spouse and having children with them. Also, rural college-educated will need to move "back home"/2
Say the unthinkable happens tonight, there is still a good chance that Ezra Klein's hypothesis about gross vote tallies proves correct--that more people will have voted for Democratic candidates than Republican ones. The craziness isn't in those vote totals but in the solutions/1

@athein1 I am not suggesting you're wrong, but I think your optimism is based on a very shaky metric.
@athein1 2018 polls are snapshots of popular votes within districts. Popular votes within districts will decide the fate of the House, not EV totals across states broadly. Polls weren't showing GOP losses in the House in 2016. Also, polls were w/i MoE in swing states in 2016...

The reason you can see an 8-point swing from one day to the next of a particular race is related to how polling is conducted. 		For instance. A #KS03 poll showed the Democratic challenger with a 12-point lead @ 51%. Just 228 polled. That number is 1/1000th of the 2014 electorate!
Here's how polling is conducted now. 1. Call a bunch of cell phones. 2. Hope that the people who answer the call and subsequently provide full answers are representative of the motivated populous in which they reside and that it captures historical trends. 3. Pray it's accurate.

@ehnottooxabi @CogitoBandito If you are going to dismiss a rigorously researched study based on the language used in a summary of the study, it tells me you're uninterested in thinking critically about the topic overall.

And yes, please show me a study disproving that the Great Recession was not prolonged by the policies throughout its 12 years. Thanks!
@ehnottooxabi @CogitoBandito Here's what's fair to say: 	- Monetary Policy created and facilitated a bubble ("Roaring 20s") 	- Hoover made terrible moves related to intervention out of panic.	- FDR instituted the reactionary policies of Hoover throughout every phase of the economy.

@ehnottooxabi @CogitoBandito WRONG!

Carlson getting cut feels like a team chemistry thing rather than what Spielman actually wanted to do. Both are understandable. 		Would bet Zimmer was intrepid that Carlson be cut. This is a guy that has had SEVERAL games, including a playoff game taken away from him by kickers.

You can always tell the celebrities unlikey to make it to their 60s from the ones that will thrive into their 70s and 80s. The latter are grounding in faith, family or both, whilst the former aren't guided by either and [often] reject the positive role of both as an inconvenience
@RBPundit Yeah. Well, when you've generated a cult following, it's probably hard to live up to their projection of what you are. It's the same thing with all celebrities who aren't grounded by either faith or family -- they feel pressure to maintain other's projection of what they are.

That said, he seems beset by the same lack of confidence and direction that the majority of his teammates have been exhibiting since the shock of going 2-0 down at Brighton. It makes me question his own mental fortitude, as he looks like he wants to blame his teammates first.
He's been out of position on several of the goals conceded, and slow to react to just about all of them. There's no question he's been the deserved MVP for four seasons running, but even your best players aren't immune to constructive criticism.
This is right. And while I defended him throughout his early shaky spell at United, I've always been of the opinion that the only thing his game lacks is in the area of anticipation, and it becomes magnified in games where he's not had much to do for vast periods of time. https://t.co/Jiho6Vkp8q

The only danger in this whole thing is when WASP and Hipster aesthetics collide. That produces what I call "The Gaines Effect" where we want to have our classic with our trends. The jury is still out on that merger. But H/T to @NoahCRothman for inspiring this thread.
It is this cultural fallacy that creates an impetus among self-reflecting hipsters like this writer, and those women I'd meet at Smith Point, et al, to sort of rebel from what was then, still a somewhat rebellious trend. /5
But what WASPs have known forever about "hipsterdom" is that a kitsch aesthetic, while pleasing in bits and pieces and always upon the first few encounters, is emblematic of a lack of uniqueness. /4
I think the biggest fallacy of the "hipster" culture is that it is and has always been wed to an aesthetic that lacks a classic appeal, and has done so on purpose. Not only to be "trendy" but also somewhat rebellious. /3
When I asked them why they enjoyed being at [Insert 1 of 4 now-defunct bars] the answer was some version of the same response: I'm tired of getting stared at by guys who I'd get along with but don't have the courage to talk to me, and the atmosphere is so much more reserved. /2

The only thing fans need to worry about is how the players react. The first half was excellent, the second half and the response to going down was diabolical. As fans, its our job to lift the club. Don't be joining in the party with those shitting all over United.
Media will always be using the SAF years as barometer by which it judges Manchester United's current status, That is why it's imperative to realize that this club may never (ever) get back to where it was under Sir Alex, and with that being realized, the stress becomes manageable
So in times like these, where the first summer of a shortened transfer market was shortened even further by the World Cup, United's (above any others) bad results will be magnified beyond reason.
In ONLY the Premier League era, Manchester United have 13 titles, which is 8 more than second place and 10 more than joint third. United fans generally fail to forget this because an anti-United bias that exists EVERYWHERE outside the club's walls views this is a threat.
to this day. United have lifted just three major trophies in 5 seasons. For just about ANY OTHER English Football Club and its fans, that would be a sustaining amount. But it isn't for United and ironically, it is the haters who expect more than the fans.
They're the Yankees, they'd say. To which my response was always the same. I was 12 when I declared my fandom, I knew nothing about transfer expenses, and I didn't know United's history until I chose them. The vitriol and banter-driven disgust that most have for MU fans continues
United, and subsequently United fans have seen nothing but success after success from the mid-nineties to the end of Sir Alex Ferguson's reign. Throughout that time I had to deal with relentless shit from fellow American soccer/football fans for being a United fan.
Honestly at the time I had only been playing football/soccer for two years and I knew nothing of the league. I picked them because they played with so much pace and expression. Cantona was still the captain and I started wearing my collar up in my AYSO games  üôÑ bc of him ü§£

Unfortunately the music industry has made mediocre musical talent the standard. While there are voices out there with the God-given talent that Aretha possessed, they may never be in the position that Aretha was in during the peak of her career.

Musically, she's an icon and you only achieve ICON status when YOUR MUSIC bends the arch of musical history. Name ANY of today's main R&amp;B/Soul singers, and I can guarantee you Aretha Franklin would be one of, if not THE first musical influence out of their mouths.
She had two children by the age of 14, well before her prolific talents would be known to manifest into the career she ultimately had. And while her personal life was never stable until well into her career, she NEVER let it define who she was.

@StephenGutowski @NoahCRothman @dcexaminer @BecketAdams @seungminkim And  FWIW I came down on yours (and Noah's) side in your exchange with RB earlier. He gets foamy at the mouth and loses some self control, and it blinds him from seeing the fact that he momentarily becomes what he claims to despise.

@StephenGutowski @dcexaminer @BecketAdams @NoahCRothman I think it's gotten MORE play recently because people like Noah have written about it extensively over the last year or so. It was a great frustration of mine when working in (for Members of) Congress (4+ years ago).
@StephenGutowski @dcexaminer @BecketAdams Slight problem with that, and I'd like to bring @NoahCRothman who has written about this issue. The searches were done for "Pounce" but the issue is that "pounce" is a catch-all for "seize" or "react" or "respond" as well as many other verbs.

@awood785 All you need to do is compare the generic ballots in 2010 and 2014 to 2018 to see what's likely to happen in terms of the response deficit + enthusiasm as quantified (poll by poll) in the "how much are you paying attention" etc.
@awood785 It's most likely that Comey's decision to re-open the Clinton email scandal likely caused the MoE swing to Trump in the rust belt states he won. While "Clinton Landslide" predictions were off, polling fell within the margin of error when it came to the EC &amp;was correct w/pop vote.
@yesh222 @NoahCRothman @evansiegfried Well, that's an excellent exception, but I think my generalization was safe, considering the number of Kosher consumers who routinely visit non-Kosher steakhouses.
@awood785 1.) The voting public doesn't like unified power, particularly when the President provides enough cannon fodder to make them rebuke his party (see: Bush, George W. c. 2006) 		2.) First year midterms are bad in general.		3.) Trump not being on the ticket is going to hurt turnout.
@awood785 Dems only need 18 seats to flipped, several key GOP races are moving towards "toss-up" ratings as we get closer... So I start looking at enthusiasm gaps and follow the money. 		I am telling you, there is enough enthusiasm on the anti-Trump side for the House to max at +20.
The House is getting flipped, the Senate should remain in Republican hands. 		Unless something changes, Trump probably wins re-election in 2020 while losing the Senate, so we'll have Democratic Congress and a Republican who was a lifelong Democrat in the Oval. 		Great...

It shouldn't be a stretch for us all to expect better of ourselves when it comes to our, "Well, we like armed diplomacy, so the overall grade needs to be weighted" rhetoric when assessing the asininity of today.

It was also abundantly clear, based on #ENG second-half performance, that the message from the dressing room at halftime was something to the effect of, "Let's not bottle this" which, when you've got the sordid WC history England does, is problematic to say the least.
2-1 Croatia defeats #ENG THAT is why you don't start saying, let alone believing, "It's coming home" like the English patriots and fans did immediately following the vanquishing of their quarterfinal ghosts.

Trump has effectively held the prestige of the Oval Office hostage to his desire to garner nonstop coverage of his words and actions. Obama did the same thing, but did so with the intention of garnering positive reinforcement. For Trump, all coverage is great (it feeds his ego).
Disagree with me all you want, but these are the traits of someone with a massive ego complex. The Summit that happened in Singapore for Trump, was entirely about him. Look at his reaction to the reporting on it afterwards.
He wanted the meeting in Singapore from the get go. Not because of expectation of a desired outcome, but because it was always going to be grand theater. Remember it was Trump who wanted it, NK backed out, then it was the WH that made sure it happened.
You can see this in the massively contradictory words and actions coming from him. He hails a North Korean defector in the SOTU, in a rhetorical flourish about the evils of the regime that was sure to get a ton of people talking and watching and clapping over his words.
Donald Trump is running the country as though he's the star of a reality TV show, and why wouldn't he? He knows his base well. They're aged 55 and older, constantly have the TV on and tuned to Fox News, while they sit at their desktops typing out misinformed replies on Facebook.

ABC's culpability in Roseanne's sideshow won't be exposed because the MSM narrative is "ABC makes incredibly noble decision."
No one at CNN is qualified enough to tell Chris how terrible his hot take is.

@NoahCRothman @Commentary What's the probability that due to Roseanne's comments getting her show cancelled, the media will now begin to cover her as though she's a "conservative voice" that is representative of conservative thought? 		I believe it'll take place because this isn't already bad enough...
Everything that is wrong with American discourse in 2018 can be seen in today's Roseanne story. It's perfectly buttressed by this piece by @NoahCRothman in last month's @Commentary magazine - The Fatalist Conceit https://t.co/xZA80A4qZ9

In the Midwest, politics doesn‚Äôt consume but an infinitesimal fraction of the brain matter that it does in the Acela gateway. It would be of great benefit if much of the DC/NYC media establishment learned that the majority of Americans are hardly ever thinking about politics.
