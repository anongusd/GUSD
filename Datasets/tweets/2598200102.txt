@realDonaldTumpr @AmbJohnBolton @realDonaldTrump @BarackObama You were praising the North Korea dictator along with Putin. Now you have investigation and missile crisis in your hands
@realDonaldTumpr @AmbJohnBolton @realDonaldTrump @BarackObama Trump finally met his match. Let see which of the two is crazier; who talks and who acts?
@AmbJohnBolton @SpecialKMB1969 @BarackObama Our country is vulnerable because @POTUS doesn't believe in science
@DiamondandSilk Why are our tax money being  spent on a man with a blow-job approval that low? 38%

Polls show Trump blow job approval dips to 38% something is wrong here...	@CNN @mitchellvii @realDonaldTrump @KellyannePolls @FoxNews

@seanhannity Thanks to Hannity, we all know now that the swamp is filled Republicans and right wing dictators
@newtgingrich At the time when you were after Bill Clinton, you had trouble on your own. I wonder what will be revealed about you now.
@Toddkron @58LesPaul @nikkihaley @jaketapper What's the difference between a socialist dictator and a right wing dictator? Asking police to hurt prisoner is a crime
@nikkihaley Do we have moral authority to lecture other nations about democracy when we have a president asking police to violate human rights?
@BreitbartNews What is uncommon is, one side publicly asking Russia to hack opponent emails. This is called treason!
@realDonaldTrump When was the last time Trump checked out the definition of insanity? Stubbornness is not leadership

@SCTeamTrump @realDonaldTrump This is the only time I agree with you. The swamp has become a sewer since January 20th at 12 o'clock
@FoxNews They should do a DNA test on the goat owner to see if he is not the father. A child from Kellyanne and Trump would look just like that too
@mitchellvii @Scaramucci Among those supporters: you and Diamond Silk? Is that why you've been talking non-sens on tweeter?
@realDonaldTrump Is it a coincidence that the next day after Trump slammed his AG, we learned of the report of the Russian ambassador to his superior?
@realDonaldTrump Smear tactics against media clearly doesn't work. Time to take responsibility for your own mistake. Stop blaming others!
@iamlaurenp @Occupocalypse Do people still watch Sean Hannity? I dout it!
