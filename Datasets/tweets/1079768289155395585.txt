@Cindylo27893961 @KamalaHarris Hey I agree with both of you...it looks like you are attacking my Feisty!
We think that this hatred for President Trump started with his election.  In hind sight, the left was just as disrespectful with President Bush we just didn‚Äôt acknowledge it.  I never will treat a Democrat with respect again.  I‚Äôll treat them exactly the way we have been treated.

@uncorruptleft @justicedems @alexandrasiera As unemployment hits the lowest point in history.  As millions are off food stamps, as black and Latino unemployment his the lowest rate in history.  And you worry about a few corporations that know how to use our tax code to their advantage blaming it on Trump.
@uncorruptleft @justicedems @alexandrasiera Again dummy, the tax changes went into effect for tax returns beginning this year.  Amazon didn‚Äôt pay taxes in 2017, which was still under the old tax code. Quit reading the leftist bias crap and use the brain that God gave you.
@uncorruptleft @justicedems @alexandrasiera Again you are clueless.  I have been the President of 3 profitable corporations. My corporations never paid Fed/State income taxes. If I saw that we were going to have a tax liability I increased spending on my employees, equipment, buildings so at the end of the year 0 liability
@uncorruptleft @justicedems @alexandrasiera Hey dummy, in order to help the poor, the city has to have income.  Now that Amazon has pulled out there won‚Äôt be much of that to help the ‚Äúpoor‚Äù.
@uncorruptleft @justicedems @alexandrasiera It‚Äôs obvious you are completely clueless to tax regulations.  When you go to H&amp;R Block to have them fill out your 1040EZ see if they can explain it to you.

@Doug65295444 @spot_on_view2 @rebekahkfreitas @PoliticalShort @carolswilliams_ @sruprect @realDonaldTrump So you have plenty of time.  The GA system is in very good shape, plenty of funds.  Ours is set up so that if she dies before me, her retirement rolls to me. If I die first, her retirement jumps up by around $10k. We took less per year for this but it was a great offering.
@Doug65295444 @spot_on_view2 @rebekahkfreitas @PoliticalShort @carolswilliams_ @sruprect @realDonaldTrump I get SS which I took at 66.  I paid in the max, her check is twice what mine is and includes some towards healthcare.  Go back to public!!!

We took three black children into our home and took care of them while their mothers were in jail (over two years) And I‚Äôm the racist
Ok,I ‚Äòm not a legal scholar so bear with me. If I impregnated a young lady and then said I wasn‚Äôt the father, the young lady can get a DNA test, prove I‚Äôm the father and collect child support from me. But if she wants to abort the child I have no say.  Something‚Äôs not right here!

@CoryerLananh Right.  Keep drinking the MSM cool-aid.  The only one that colluded with Russia was Hillary.  She and Bill should both be in jail with life sentences.
@CoryerLananh We did, two. But only after major surgery on her uterus which was too small to allow a child to grow to full term.  Both our children were born prematurely and by C-section.  Both are now healthy adults.
@CoryerLananh No actually I can‚Äôt. In both cases the child had no rights.
@OliverMcGee @farmworker57 @AOC @POTUS @realDonaldTrump @RepAOC Now there‚Äôs an immature, spoiled little 2 year old.  Nancy put the little tyrant in timeout.
@TG2TruthSeeker @Boo3zero5 It‚Äôs ok because he‚Äôs not a Catholic, doesn‚Äôt drink beer and isn‚Äôt a Conservative.
The only way socialism could work, at least for the short term, is to allow the Government to take away our guns.  It certainly worked in Venezuela.  For the short term....
@Magaman103 I agree

@michell41527274 @LaylaAlisha11 @Dondorey1 @POTUS And please, if you end up pregnant, your ‚Äúwoman‚Äôs health issues‚Äù are your own slutty fault.  Keep your damn legs together bitc*!

@BrianQuinn36 @sherry25793049 I don‚Äôt talk to Democrats
@MrTrumpLA @Trumponly Mr. TrumpLA, have you ever had a couple three drinks or so?  She should have been arrested for DWL.  Drinking While Leading!!
Will someone please explain to me why Democrats screamed when a child was separated from the mother at the boarder but have no problem with separating mother/child after birth...personally I don‚Äôt believe they give a damn in either case, that would require that they had a soul.
We have a Senator that lied about her heritage. A Senator that lied about his military service. A Congress woman that lied about her address to run for office. An ex-President that lied about his birthplace. A Pres candidate that lied about her email. Common link all Democrats
My wife and I lost our first two children at 5 months of pregnancy. For my wife it was the most devastating thing I‚Äôve ever seen her go through. I can‚Äôt imagine a woman aborting a child at all, but at 9 months, impossible.  What kind of human could do this? What are these women?
@toddstarnes  I throughly enjoyed your editorial today, ‚ÄúFront row seat‚Äù.  I saw a bunch of angry, immature, poorly educated adult/children, mostly female, that need to get a mental, reality checkup.   The scary thing is that people voted for these children.
@QTAnon1 @kimquilts55 That explains the huge gap between her two front teeth! https://t.co/y2zMGOAapm
@lovesmilelaugh2 @mollyri35913891 What‚Äôs her name ? Bitc*?
Hey, Virginia, see what happens when you let Democrats take over your State!  Is there an honest, ethical, moral politician left in VA?  Maybe, but certainly not in the party you voted for to lead your State. https://t.co/GVAtNd9ZS4
@petluvers4Trump @Dondorey1 @AOC Because AOC, that‚Äôs how adults act. Of course, we can‚Äôt expect adult behavior from a two year old brat.
@Serremmy She needs to go!
RT @Serremmy: @AOC said she won't shake Trump's hand at the State of the Union.		Is AOC in 1st grade needing a time out?		She's an idiot wh‚Ä¶

@LaylaAlisha11 @Dondorey1 @POTUS Can you imagine if one of these immature, self serving, psychotic female adult children were ever put in charge of running anything much less the country!!
@RealSaavedra @JoelGuidry3 So this leaves a guy who cleans the toilets at the VA Capital that has a record that is clean enough to take over as Governor.  Oh wait, it‚Äôs just come out that he‚Äôs not a citizen.
@misspunk63 @go4itbas Agreed
I have to ask again.  Where was Ruth G?  If she was healthy enough to go to a concert the night before (according to the MSM) she is healthy enough to show up at the President‚Äôs SOTU speech.  Wait, maybe she didn‚Äôt actually go the concert?? The MSM wouldn‚Äôt lie would they??
@mikebwonder @Dondorey1 Yes
@ReElectNydia @thecjpearson @AOC You aren‚Äôt the future of our country, you are figment of your own immaturity, imagination and ignorance.

@therealsusanq Thank you.
Did anyone see Ruth, what‚Äôs her name there tonight?
@OfficeOfMike @KevinBooker212 So are Hillary, Beto and Gillum.  Standard practice for libs

@Claireb531 @realDonaldTrump @SpeakerPelosi Which America are you talking about?
To my fellow MAGA friends, I apologize for the MAGA‚Äôs in Georgia, that you had to listen to this tax evading, tax cheating loser from my state.
What an incredible speech!!  Thank you President Trump!!!

@RAMRANTS @kimmwaters4 You‚Äôre going to be disappointed I‚Äôm certain
@CillizzaCNN Yeah unlike Obumble, er, a, me, me, I, er, me, .... idiot with a teleprompter
@MrFrancis_ Funny!!!
If a parent can decide to abort their child just after birth why can‚Äôt they wait until say, 6 months, a year or maybe in the the terrible twos?
@mam65mam66 @45Quickdraw4 @Patriots @Flyguy2stackz @AmSovereignNews Good thing he didn‚Äôt yell ‚ÄúTrump‚Äù, ‚ÄúTrump‚Äù,  the refs would have called foul!
@dbongino @progolfdave What a dumb question.  The answer is obvious, those countries don‚Äôt have someone as intelligent as AOC or perhaps Bernie Sanders in charge.
The only ad last night during the Super Bowl I laughed at was the NFL ad.  The rest of them sucked. https://t.co/fD8grBEKCl
@Lrihendry @Patriots Yeah, well if LA could have brought their own refs, it wouldn‚Äôt have even been close!
@MazurikL @LadyLibertyInEx @GovernorVA And some of you don‚Äôt think God is in charge....Cuomo, you‚Äôre next....thank you Jesus!
@BrainyMisc Geeeze, I‚Äôm glad this didn‚Äôt go into overtime!!
@CB618444 @beaglebabe48 @FirstLadyVA @GovernorVA Unfortunately there were no children to attend as they all had been aborted

@MCDeeXX93 @WeesThePeople @yonkersartie @HillaryClinton @RichardTBurnett @TheDemocrats Cough
As President Trump pulls more and more middle class workers, blacks and Latinos away from the Democrats, the only way they can win is via illegals. Build the damn wall!!
@KimberlyMrsRR1 @sherrynron Finally someone with common sense
@SebGorka @CkcGrandmac Yeah, who would have thought the Democratic Governor of VA was a racist!!
@bigbadant @cathyinvegas Hey ass wipes, you don‚Äôt even belong in the Super Bowl, so STFU!

@OldManDuke @JoelGuidry3 Love this!
@AngeleStar11 @sherry25793049 I hope he is drummed out of office and never heard from again.  Love to see Democrats true colors exposed.
Hey Judge, you left wing hack, if you gave a crap about this case and fairness, you would have blasted Mueller‚Äôs SWAT team arrest of a 71 year old man and his wife being televised by CNN. https://t.co/mLbnB12Y0A
@os4185 I‚Äôm thrilled that you are disappointed.
Breaking news: CNNBS is reporting that Ruth Bater Ginsburg has thrown her hat into the ring for a run at the Democratic Presidential nomination.  As soon as she brought out of the medically induced coma she has been in for two months, she‚Äôll officially announce.

I wonder how much psychological fall out society will have with these women who choose to abort a child after birth...only time will tell but I predict there will be pain and suffering for them for years.
@Claireb531 @WayneDupreeShow And have 9 witnesses that she won‚Äôt be able to name, a place she can‚Äôt identify, a date that she can‚Äôt remember and all the liberals will applaud her.

What gets me with Democrats is that all most every single aborted baby would have been a voting Democrat.  They kill off their offspring and bring in illegals to replace them.  Go figure

@Chris_1791 @Techmeme Do the math.  Phones use to cost $300, now $1200.  Little harder to justify spending $1,200 for a better camera, screen, whatever.  People are only buying them when they have to, not as before, because they wanted to.  An iPhone 10xxx is not any cooler than my iPhone 7, 8xxx

Global Warming didn‚Äôt fit the facts, Climate Change.  What‚Äôs next?
@Myon22visMin No complete proof that Democrats are nothing more, thanks to our public school systems, than bots to their party.  They no longer have any ability to think rationally.

In a liberal‚Äôs mind: you run credit cards up and decide not to pay, walk away.  You buy a home that you can‚Äôt afford, walk away.  You get pregnant and decide you don‚Äôt want the baby, abort away.   No responsibility for anything.  This will come crashing down on them.
@honor_dennis @xformed It is after lunch don‚Äôt you know.  He was thirsty!
God gave us his only son, Jesus, to die on the cross for our sins.  After the law passed in NY yesterday on abortion up and until birth, I doubt he would do it again.  I think he may just decide it would be easier to start all over.  Thank you liberals.
When will liberals give the Government the right to choose which babies are aborted?  It‚Äôs coming you liberals morons.

@wendytee41 @JDugudichi @CaptainHottub No, should I? I have read Childs, Balducci, Ellsworth, and 10‚Äôs of others.  I like mysteries, legal thrillers, plain novels like the Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, and many others
@JDugudichi @CaptainHottub PS the last novel I read was the latest Jack Reacher, Past Tense!
@JDugudichi @CaptainHottub I read everyday.  If I had to pick an author, Lee Child.  I absolutely love the Jack Reacher series.
@Feisty_FL Cool! Happy New Year to you as well!

@Razorsmack1 @kimquilts55 Please add me.  Trying to rebuild after getting booted and losing all followers
@TomiLahren @UkraineBlues As a husband of a successful wife and daughter, I‚Äôm not sure exactly what rights a woman doesn‚Äôt have....can one of you enlighten women please educate me.   I‚Äôll update my wife and daughter on my education as obviously they are not informed women about things like this.
@JackPosobiec @kimquilts55 Cute!
@catturd2 @kimquilts55 Can I make a slight correction to your very humorous tweet.  It should have read, ‚ÄúWhen Hillary stumbles into a liquor store....‚Äù.
@Feisty_FL No tweets while driving!!
@Stephan21852273 @UkraineBlues @kimquilts55 This is my 4th Account.  I‚Äôve also lost thousands of followers 4 times.  The first three times Twitter couldn‚Äôt even tell me why.   This time I took a picture of the ‚Äúoffensive‚Äù tweet.  Totally BS.
My Christmas present from my  son-in-law!!  He‚Äôs the greatest!! https://t.co/dRNl4tvD4h
@emma19raya I‚Äôm with you.  I was taken down on Saturday.  Starting all over again with 0 followers.   4th time!

@tallman_bob @Feisty_FL That is beautiful!
@Feisty_FL @ninarzep Based on how far down Abacrappy and Wintch has fallen in the past 20 years, it‚Äôs probably best.  I have vest I bought there 20 years ago that I still wear.  I haven‚Äôt been in one of their stores in forever.
@Feisty_FL    Hey I‚Äôm back, Twitter kicked me off again.  Starting all over,  already following you.  Was MAGAMike1
