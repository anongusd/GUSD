Thanks @realDonaldTrump for your declaration of a nationwide public health emergency to address the opioid crisis.
In 2014, the number of babies born drug-dependent had increased by 500 percent since 2000
In 2015, there were 52,404 drug overdose deaths ‚Äî 33,091 of those deaths, almost two-thirds, involved the use of opioids.
Drug overdoses are now the leading cause of injury death in the United States.
Since 2000, over 300,000 Americans have died from overdoses involving opioids.
In 2016, more than two million Americans had an addiction to prescription or illicit opioids.
The opioid crisis has destroyed too many families across our country. We must work together to end this epidemic.
It was an active discussion with @realDonaldTrump &amp; my Republican colleagues today. Mr. President, A+.
Had a GREAT + PRODUCTIVE meeting with @realDonaldTrump. We are working together to cut taxes.

@Ppayne2Payne Not relevant to compare incumbent race vs open seat.  Had Tom Price again this week he would have won by a very large margin.
All-in spend in GA6 ~30M Ossoff  to ~$23M Handel.  (1) too much spent (2) no anti-Trump wave (3) candidates matter
@rickklein All-in spend Ossoff ~$30.2M to Handel $22.7M.  WAY too much spent for one seat.
@jmartNYT @CLFSuperPAC @FP1Strategies Looks like all-in spend was ~$30M Ossoff  to ~$23M Handel.  I think @FP1Strategies was the secret sauce.  :)
