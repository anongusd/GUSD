@ihcdhaka We Bangladeshi People Wants To Restore Right Democracy &amp; Voting Power Back.	Please Help To Stop Disappearance &amp; Extra Judicial Killing In Bangladesh.
এই দাবী শুধু বিএনপির একার নয়, সমগ্র বাংলাদেশের জনগনের।	কারন হাসিনার সরকারের অধীনে বিগত সময় এ ৮০% নির্বাচন ই খারাপ হয়েছে।	সবার দাবী- নিরপেক্ষ সরকারের অধীনে সবার অংশগ্রহনে জাতীয় নির্বাচন এবং নির্বাচনে অধিক ক্ষমতা দিয়ে সেনা মোতায়েন করতে হবে। https://t.co/0d2KN0gDEB
শেখ হাসিনা ৫ই জানুয়ারি তে জনগনের ভোট ছাড়া ক্ষমতায় এসেছে।	তখন বলেছিল এটা সংবিধান রক্ষার নির্বাচন,আলাপ আলোচনা করে দ্রুত নতুন নির্বাচন দিবে।	কিন্তু হাসিনা তার কথার বরখেলাপ করেছে।	তিনি জনগনের অধিকারের সাথে বেঈমানি করেছে।	জনগন নিরপেক্ষ সরকারের অধীনে নির্বাচিন চায়। https://t.co/xVrhNjL96G
