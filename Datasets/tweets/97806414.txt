Homan, Acting Director of @ICEgov is a little confused. States he cares about the well being of children, yet he has no prblm separating them from their parents, which is the most traumatic experience a child can experience. #KeepFamiliesTogether #UnitedAgainstHate https://t.co/q8FLmYapL6
The Trump administration is separating families seeking asylum. This among other hateful anti immigrant policies are policies the Center for Immigration Studies supports and Thomas Homan @ICEgov continues to reinforce. #DefundICE #UnitedAgainstHate #FamiliesBelongTogether
Homan, Acting Director of @ICEgov claiming detention facilities that house minors r in their best conditions. Calling BS on ur claim. Take a min to read ACLU’s report which reflects accurate info on horrible conditions minors are subject to. https://t.co/XF2bZ0ai8G
