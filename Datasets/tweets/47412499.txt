For the sake of our military and for the sake of our national security, we must #ActOnClimate
Center for Naval Analysis report says, for 1st time, climate change is “catalyst for conflict” - a driving force behind unrest around world
Results will be higher demand for US troops abroad while we deal with devastating impacts from flooding and extreme weather events @ home
QDR says climate change will influence resource competition &amp; place more burdens on economies, societies, &amp; gov institutions around world
DOD’s Quadrennial Def. Review stated threat of climate change a serious nat'l security vulnerability that could enable terrorist activity.
Climate change is a national security concern &amp; a new form of stress on our military readiness.
Almost everyone gets the fact that climate change is happening. Everyone but the House majority &amp; a filibuster-sufficient Senate minority.
It’s absurd that military leaders should dismiss widely held and unequivocal fact that planet's warming &amp; human activities are responsible.
#SoundTheAlarm4Climate &amp; wake Congress up! We must #ActOnClimate &amp; cut greenhouse gases 40-70% by 2050 to avoid catastrophic global warming!
