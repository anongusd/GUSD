Yup, its pretty much a curse I‚Äôm dealing with here. 		While I can act tough and try and say it‚Äôs not that cold, the worst part of what I‚Äôm doing is that objects and the water I need tends to freeze very easily. 		I thought ahead and filled up the reserves. 		Nice. ‚úåÔ∏èüá∫üá∏
@GOP @JewelsJones1 And there‚Äôs that 12 years later the world is going to end thing.

@sahouraxo It can‚Äôt be too easy to just forgive the police for that one time they shot tear gas at you, and beat you with a baton, and sprayed chemicals and n your face. 	How can the people move on from this point and ever be civil, as maybe I‚Äôve known it to be like? 	Were we ever civil?
Yeah I have to work outside regardless. I suppose ill be leaving a bit of sanity behind. 	I can‚Äôt promise I wouldn‚Äôt drop dead from boredom, or exhaustion if worse comes to worse. 	Maybe there‚Äôs a divine curse that carries me through the day. 	Hey, it‚Äôs been fun. ‚úåÔ∏èüá∫üá∏

@KamalaHarris I was in a flood once. I drove to a house to do some work, opened the car door and before I set my foot in the ground it had rained over six inches, in that one moment. 	It was known as a high flood area, and that was a pretty crazy thing to occur like that.
@zaku1982 It‚Äôs some of the most disgusting visual artwork ever made. 		Good times.
And then even IF the perpetrator of the crime is caught, and brought to trial, there in lies the issue. 	Buddy, I‚Äôm temporarily insane 50 times a day! The chances of being temporarily insane are better than seing nudity at a strip club. 	So why does that make murder acceptable?

@AOC @LindseyGrahamSC What kind of health benefits would a government employee be receiving usually, and if so, is that still in affect, even amidst a partial shutdown? 	And if so, can a relief fund actually be established, in case of future occurrences? Through legislation, like an act or something.
@AOC @LindseyGrahamSC We‚Äôd be looking at like $1300 a week. If anyone is working at least 40 hours in that week, is there even time, to actually spend money on anything? Unless it‚Äôs an elaborate drinking or drug habit? 	Obviously, that would raise a level of concern.
@AOC @LindseyGrahamSC Yeah, I get free food all the time with my bonus points at gas stations. 		Is the average salary your government employees get around $70,000? 		I want to know how they spend the money. That seems like a high enough salary, that everyone should be pretty well off for awhile.

It‚Äôs pretty hard to say anyone wouldn‚Äôt take a bribe to let a container full of drugs slip by the checklist. 	It‚Äôs too risky in that case, so we need to build the wall. 	It‚Äôs not about the drugs.
Ok, so one person thinks a wall isn‚Äôt needed because 95% of drugs arrive via shipping containers. 	If that is so, then the job of a shipping clerk, will be to check every single container on a manifesto. 	I thought it was. 		And we STILL need the wall.

@NeesyinPA Totally odd. That looks like some literal collusion right there. 	That is Webster‚Äôs definition of collusion in action. 	They are definitely up to something.
@TessaLeBaronT The objective in life is to do the opposite of this. To create a system of renewable, sustainable resources, that are not affected by list price. 	Yeah I don‚Äôt see why too many peoplewouod appreciate this Agenda 21 business. It sounds pretty dirty.

@JacobAWohl @AmericanYvonne Welp, the human body certainly is a work of art. Those selfies must be worth enough to build us a thousand walls. 	Applause.
Welp, looks like we got some rain tonight. Odd considering the time of year, sure. 	It‚Äôs either global warming, pole reversal, or we need a Wall. 		Oooooh yes.
@AspenSawyer @onaturalia Absolutely. A false allegation holds its own criminal charge. 		All of those messages you posted pics of, being worded exactly the same are suspicious as well.
@zaku1982 I have NO problems with anyone owning tree people. As long as the tree person is taken care of, then my business lies elsewhere.
There‚Äôs a definite cultural flaw that exists somewhere. It‚Äôs just not my job to pinpoint it. 	There is probably people that get paid thousands of dollars to make pie graphs and flow charts. 	Fancy, I admit it. I want the story straight from the cats meow. 		Later.
So what we‚Äôre those refugees, actually trying to avoid, I wonder.... 		I can suspect it was that one gang that cuts off heads..... 	but they are here also. 		I saw the kids flashing those gang signs like he was cool. 		Yeah real cool. Perfect department store manager type.
Oh how about if I get drunk, and have sex with someone‚Äôs wife or sister, and get her pregnant. 	Am I not at that time considerably involved in some type of courtship? 	We already bypassed tons of social obligations already. 	Even that most primitive action has rules.
Proper and improper 		Legal and illegal as well. 		Oh wait, let‚Äôs say I‚Äôm walking down the street and see a house. That doesn‚Äôt mean the house belongs to me just because I looked at it. Even if I walk on the property and into the house! There are laws conserning ownership.
You would then consider me to be an immigrant. One that has the intention of living, accordingly, and through my own ability to do so. 		We should be able to make some obvious comparisons to what I would do, versus what some people are currently doing. 		There is right and wrong.
Maybe there‚Äôs customs and laws I‚Äôm not aware of I would want to look into before even going. Hmmm.... why would it be any different for anyone. 	So let‚Äôs see.... paperwork, passport, house, job, money, all these things. 		Ever see the Hostel movies? 		Good times.
So let‚Äôs say I just felt like moving to another country one day, for whatever reason that would be. 	I don‚Äôt just GO there and all of a sudden start doing my thing. 	I would need the money to buy property or land or housing to begin with. 	I might need to arrange a job. 	More.
I was researching how Visas and Greencards work these days. It‚Äôs all pretty legit. 	The US isn‚Äôt the only country that has that kind of system. A person would have to be extremely ignorant or mentally retarded to neglect that sort of thing, considering the consequences.
@chuckwoolery That‚Äôs pretty crazy, considering how much of a better idea it is to have a certain Wall with the features I had previously mentioned. 	It‚Äôs like getting a flat tire, and instead of fixing it, just go get yourself some ice cream. 		Yeah! That‚Äôll do the trick!
What‚Äôs this? https://t.co/oAtvvQOTsL
@babysgramma @KamalaHarris I tried looking for a clever GIF to entertain and humor you. 	There just isn‚Äôt one available at the moment that justifies the shear rage and disappointment I feel when thinking about that guy. 		It‚Äôs ok. He‚Äôs gone. We are going to be ok. 		Merry Christmas!
@AspenSawyer It‚Äôs really great having the chance to visit family for a bit. Im pretty psyched about these new wool socks. I am so ready for winter. 	(It‚Äôs only 50 degrees, but I‚Äôm ready) 		I have so many snacks right now. I am all set. ‚úåÔ∏è
@babysgramma @KamalaHarris I really like what you said there. I think by doing that, people will be ready for all the opportunity available and have a better chance at being successful as well. 	Right on.
@Ocasio2018 King Herod wasn‚Äôt that great at all. Think about how different we are as people, compared to the way they were then. 	Wow!
@zaku1982 I am a master of that cabinet.
In a lot of ways, The Wall is like the first railroad that was constructed in America. 		Look how that turned out. 		You like trains don‚Äôt you?
It finally happened. 		Often I will say, that someone can‚Äôt do this, and she did it! 		I am impressed. https://t.co/oI4sbViHgE
@BobbySpitzerr @stoolpresidente @MikeysDead That pizza looks exactly how I want it. One of these days I really need to visit NY area. I am a ridiculous pizza fan. Nice.
@CozyFaline @WillMay64506519 Good times. I was totally waiting for one of them to do the ol turnaround..... nice!
@realDonaldTrump I think those drugs are stupid though. 		I understand the importance of protecting our physical border as is. Unless we wanted to expand the territory. Then, hey..... get ready for some fun. Lol. üá∫üá∏‚úåÔ∏è Merry Christmas!
@realDonaldTrump We think someone was involved in foreign interests for the sake of acquiring access to some kind of opiates. 	It keeps people drugged up and dependent on government aid.	Aside from that I think The Wall is a great thing to look forward to. I wish I could help you more.
@MikeysDead @marisatomei Because that movie is golden. And Marisa Tomei is amazing.
@TommyDoyle47 I think that‚Äôs secretly happening. That would be so great.
If you don‚Äôt earn something, but are just given what is taken from others, is that really dignity? Is that what this is about? https://t.co/mnnMN5oxQx
@TommyDoyle47 Right on. The original and part 2 are what set the bar for us. They can‚Äôt be beat, barely reached. 	Probably because of the effects, like you are saying. 	I do think they can go places with this storyline. I wouldn‚Äôt mind a tie-in with some Aliens and Colonial Marines in the mix.
@KimberlyMrsRR1 @LindaForAmerica Yeah, we all get a blunderbuss and automatic crossbows and explosives too. 	Ain‚Äôt life grand? 		Yes it is. üá∫üá∏‚úåÔ∏è
The new Predator movie was great. At least I think so. 		It had these moments that I will remember, because they were so great. 		It has a drive, in a direction that I want to follow. I see good things in the future. Nice!		‚úåÔ∏è
@TommyDoyle47 I just watched it. I think it‚Äôs a winner. I want more and more. 		There are priceless moments that hit the spot.
@RisingAsch @boilingbutter Wow that was pretty crazy. There was a golden opportunity for at least one person in that video to learn something. 	There was no need for the situation to turn into such an argument. But it‚Äôs too late.
@realDonaldTrump New idea. A sensor that detects new tunnels. Something that works like a sonar, or what geologists use to measure seismic waves. 	Oh look we created new jobs. There‚Äôs people that love looking at monitors. That‚Äôs all they do is monitor the monitors. Great job with health benefits.
@zaku1982 It‚Äôs pretty damn good. I just watched it last night. They could just keep making that kind of movie. It‚Äôs very enjoyable. 		Buy it if you have the means.
@HungryTrucker I know what you mean, these sausages have a job to do.....
@HungryTrucker Coffee and blueberry donuts. I tear up a package of cocktail sausages.
@KamalaHarris That‚Äôs probably a great idea. Why hasn‚Äôt someone done that already?
@AmyMek He doesn‚Äôt know about Saint Nicholas. He has his own day. 		It‚Äôs only a fact. 		I can‚Äôt explain how the Lord works, I just appreciate it.
@RepSwalwell @realDonaldTrump International gang activity. I‚Äôve read quite a bit about it. The numbers reaching tens of thousands. They pray on those kids too. Do you know what the membership fee is?
@jjauthor Doesn‚Äôt socialism punish everyone to help them in ways they never need or want?
I can spend more money than you. There is nothing difficult about making it rain.
@PredictionMan Ya know I really would think the same thing. 		It‚Äôs almost like someone went ahead and blew all the money on a pair of gold boots and two hands of blackjack. 		They really jazzed it all up.
I want there to be multiple designated locations, with offices that know what they‚Äôre doing to get you where you need to go faster. 	These location offer accommodations. Maybe there‚Äôs fees, I don‚Äôt know. The point is, there‚Äôs cool stuff for you, but I need you to be cool too.
You see at the time, people immigrated by boat across an ocean. Sometimes it takes months to get there. 	Boats only dock at ports. Typically there was and is an immediate documentation process they went and go through. 	You know what a stowaway is right? Big trouble. That‚Äôs what.
The Statue of Liberty. The symbol of freedom, the hope, the dreams that come to be. 		What about you? 		All you get is a fence to look at. Oh yeah it‚Äôs a wall. 		Either way I wanted more to show you when you arrive. 		I wanted a new world to open up to you. I‚Äôm not done yet.
@zaku1982 That‚Äôs a classic from when I was just a wee lad. Lol
@ollieisyms @SickMolly Don‚Äôt feel too bad. This is all that‚Äôs left of my cheese and discount crackers. It‚Äôs just a little cracker dust, that‚Äôs all. ‚úåÔ∏è https://t.co/xyNzXRz3EY
@KamalaHarris It‚Äôs pretty disgusting to see people stuck in cages, that‚Äôs for damn sure. 	I don‚Äôt know who built or approved that place, but it wouldn‚Äôt be a bad idea to get some remodeling done. With the quickness too.
That‚Äôs gross. I can‚Äôt stand it when I repeat the same word too often. My editor is on a coffee break. Yeah.......sounds nice.
@KamalaHarris I‚Äôm interested in knowing why this border wall is considered to be useless. 		I really see the potential it can offer, especially to the entire immigration process. 		I had a far grander idea than just a wall though. I had an entire facility concept designed to aid new migrants.
This is how a lot of people feel right now. https://t.co/NKprYCz2mc
Precisely. https://t.co/8imlDw8V1k
Almost 1 am ? Psssshhh it never stops.
No matter how much training and classroom knowledge we carry, there‚Äôs always a struggle that takes its toll. 	It‚Äôs crazy how the occupation requires the best in a person. 	Great show. 	Really check it out if you have a chance. 		Later ‚úåÔ∏è
Ever watch Flashpoint? 		It‚Äôs a tv show that has that swat team that will negotiate with threats. Sometimes it‚Äôs terrorist groups, sometimes a person about to attempt suicide. 	It‚Äôs always intense. I learned something every episode. 		And we can never be prepared for next time.
I don‚Äôt know. I‚Äôve never been at that point in life, where kicking another person while they were down is where i want to be. 		Maybe it just depends on what time it is. Not me personally, but throughout time that‚Äôs just the way it is. We fight. For reasons not even known.
I saw this one guy in a short video from San Francisco, kicking another guy in the face while on the ground. 		So many questions come to mind in seeing this. 		Why is it happening? Is it even real? Am I supposed to even see this? Can this ever be resolved?
I can easily refer to Cain and Abel as reference. 	Nothing taught Cain that killing Abel was wrong, or did he know otherwise, and was further persuaded? 	Would knowing, bring us closer together? 	Why be so distant?
be consoled. 		By who or what force on this planet is there to talk this down? To make a situation be not that of violence, but something else that we as people can learn right from wrong and move on. 		When the answers aren‚Äôt there, when most needed, what can stop it?
So after I research the Bible and a few of the current laws we have on file, I wonder. 	At what point in time, and by whom, does a man or woman or other, that is seeking blood and vengeance, be it due to hormonal rage, jealousy, spite, ignorance, or for reasons I know not, be...
I really think there‚Äôs a specific to this. Otherwise anyone that sells  a product or service is committing extortion. That ‚Äúhard sell‚Äù technique that can‚Äôt be refused, to me seems to fit the bill.	Does it seem like there‚Äôs a prerequisite for the type of behavior? I think so.
I started researching a new topic tonight, which for the moment is ‚Äúextortion‚Äù and a few of its forms.	 I‚Äôm wondering if this can happen even unintentionally, or if it‚Äôs a specific course of action. 	Like when two or more people are making certain types of financial deals? Hmm.
@CraigRSawyer This differs from things like armed robbery right? 	I currently think at least one way to commit extortion, is through blackmail. 	Whereas some types of photography can force a person, or even a group of people to offer money or certain actions, or entire properties. 	Right?
@realDonaldTrump In the forest preserve by me, there is a trail camera with an intercom to reach the on duty patrols. 	It is effective. All sorts of situations can arise. 	Personally I appreciate that it‚Äôs there, just in case.
@Trenton_Hoshiko I just went through New Super Mario Bros the other night, saved the princess, and there was a surprise after the credits! 		It‚Äôs good. Challenging as well.
@realDonaldTrump If this was mounted on top of a raised concrete form that had a parapet projected from it, and a moat type trench. Well that‚Äôs a winner right there. 		If there was an added surveillance system with intercom in case of an emergency, oh my, that would be craaaazy.
@chuckwoolery Thats a disputable accusation for sure! 	I could easily say that, ANY Democrat would do the same. 	Is that the end-all of scapegoats, that everyone is a Hitler-type Baby Jesus killer? 		Well that‚Äôs some bullshit right there. 		Build That Wall.
@President1Trump @GregMcdevitt There can‚Äôt be a reason why this person is standing in the middle of the road like this. 	By all means, the person is entitled to prayer, but there‚Äôs still no logical explanation as to why it is being done at that location and time. Oh well.
@Tell_Michelle_ I‚Äôm going to be requesting our wall until the end of time or until we get our wall. 	Sad But True, by Metallica is a great theme song. I think it really strikes a chord with the younger crowd.
@LouDobbs @WillMay64506519 YES		 I want to see scientific R&amp;D and entire Wall society groups designing the most fabulous Wall we can create! 		No bullshit this or that.		We want to get medieval on this bitch.
@FoxNews is looking pretty badass. https://t.co/YgF3KOul3J
I have never watched in any form of media in my lifetime so far, ANY politician, exclaim in anger, that murder is illegal, and reinforce that notion, what the hell. 	But these guns no matter what its purpose, is icky and so horrible. 	And that‚Äôs a problem. https://t.co/VSqFBgRugl

@sluts_guts She could win a miss universe contest. You got that right!
There is no reason to build a green house with a louvered roof for all year growing of your favorite plants and produce. 		Yeah that would be so dumb. Psssh . Dumb like a fox. 		What does the fox say?
We have louvered roofs on stadiums so people can play football, that nets hundreds of millions of dollars in revenue. 		Why would a partial wall for internationalsecurity be out of the question?
You might wonder things like, why DID Cain kill Abel? 	One explanation exists, that Cain may have been offspring of  Samael. The Devil. 	So that really means a few things to me. I may say more about that later. 	Eventually, The Flood wiped out all of Cain‚Äôs family. So be careful.
I was just researching genealogy from my Bible. It looks pretty good. 	What happens when we start throwing Greek mythology into the mix? 	Well, this just got a whole lot more interesting.
@Terrenc43516485 I‚Äôm not a member of Congress and I still want that info. Lol 		Build The Wall.
@Terrenc43516485 Hey if there was a wall around Egypt, who‚Äôs to say they wouldn‚Äôt let Jesus in? 	Maybe they would‚Äôve had Joseph sign some papyrus, and call it a day. 	I wonder what these refugees were fleeing from still. 	If I was a member of Congress I would want some info on that.
@Terrenc43516485 From what I understand, ‚Äúthe left‚Äù has absolutely spoken down upon Christmas, Christianity in general, pretty much anyone that‚Äôs conservative as well as the Republican Party. 	So it‚Äôs pretty jazzed up right now. .....

@joepalojoe @dsdr2011 @gatewaypundit Well holy shit. Typically when any person is brandishing a weapon of ANY kind, it is with the intention to cause harm. 	Especially when in the direction of an officer, as stated. 	So there‚Äôs obviously something strange going on there. Yup.
@RealJamesWoods As well as Nancy and her crew being entirely against doing anything wall related. 	So that‚Äôs pretty suspicious to me. 	It makes me wonder if she‚Äôs got a footsie game going on under the table. 	I wonder if she even recognizes the situational need for the wall at this time. Or what
@RealJamesWoods Yeah but he‚Äôs actively vocal and enthusiastic about the wall. Things are happening, ideas are up in the air. 		What about all of Congress? I feel like I can hear crickets chirp. 	I know of no single person that does NOT want a wall, yet Congress itself is fast asleep about it. üòê
@Terrenc43516485 Earlier in the week I saw something really dumb. It made me completely despondent for a   almost two days. 		I‚Äôm thankful I forgot what it was specifically, but that‚Äôs just me. 		I think you are correct though.

It caused trouble for many, and you killed a bunch of people, in the process. All you did was waste a bunch of my time. No sweat off my brow. I‚Äôve got tons of the stuff. 		And I hope you get what‚Äôs coming to you. Could be nothing. Who knows. There‚Äôs always a bird that sings.

So let‚Äôs say you‚Äôre moving to this general region. 	You have to go through customs. You have a ton of paperwork to attend to. 	You need something to keep your children occupied while you take care of your business. 	Hello! Carousel! 	Think about Disney Land/World.
So in knowing, that something like that, as well as the fact that the carousel that is set up at the mall, is something that can achieve a certain level of joy and entertainment for the kids, is why I think there should be set up for the wall. 	It‚Äôs something to look forward to.

Does this sound interesting? I‚Äôd love to elaborate.
@Tell_Michelle_ I think the benefits of having a type of physical barrier at the border, is far superior to not having one at all. 	What I imagine isn‚Äôt even just a wall. It‚Äôs protection, it‚Äôs guidance to a safe entry point, it‚Äôs a form of energy source if utilizing a natural water source.

@sluts_guts @clueXfore These guts are going to offer a bit of mushiness and pliability. 	You can coat them with ickiness but they can be cleaned off if needed. 	If assembled how I imagine, they should look kind of lumpy and have some realistic texture and weight too.

@stripedbanana3 @Terrenc43516485 Not sure. 		I know I don‚Äôt want those drugs in circulation though. If the tariffs are what can get the job done, then I say ok.
The way I read this, is that people can commit these atrocities, and there is little to nothing to worry about. Meanwhile, victims of such acts, are having their lives basically RUINED. 	And I am not ok with this. https://t.co/adnWcZ7WQt
It‚Äôs interesting how after playing through I remember having done this before. I realize entire years of my life were forgotten. Maybe it‚Äôs just a little fuzzy..... üòê
This really is quite the walk in the park. The transition to RE4 is the biggest change, where we have the opportunity for head shots all day.	That‚Äôs all RE3 was lacking. I like the searching around and crowd control, but I know I‚Äôd save ammo with my natural marksmanship ability.

And it seems not every model handgun has this tilting barrel feature. 	So I wonder if certain models are more user friendly, and actually safer for bystanders. 	I like a 1911. A M9 is really sweet too. 	I would be unable to pick favorites.
Yeah they made this law concerning handguns, that if you attach a stock to it, and the barrel is less than 16 inches in length, it is a ‚Äúshort barrel rifle‚Äù. 	So they made longer barrels. And it‚Äôs so damn silly to me. 	It tilts while in action. Think about the physics of this.
One of the things no person should want on a pistol is a long ass barrel flopping around spitting bullets anywhere you didn‚Äôt intend to go.	Has anyone actually seen what I‚Äôm talking about?
@realDonaldTrump You could easily throw some equity around at my current location. I need drainage ducts and rooflines, physical workers for maintenance and a whole slew of activity. 	I can‚Äôt do it alone!

@GlomarRises True, but like you said universal ones are pretty shitty. 	If they made the form on the Blackhawk a little different, it would probably work on a variety of platforms at least. I‚Äôm thinking it would just have to retain at the trigger guard. It already has the tension spring.
Piles. I mean huge piles of walkers. Think about that Geraldo. 	Walkers with gaping head wounds, and torsos ripped in tway. 	We would be pouring diesel on those walkers and lighting it up. 	#TWD

@ollieisyms That‚Äôs right Mr. Oli-Bear. There are doins afoot over in that big capital building, and we need to get involved. Pronto.
So why is due process one of the most important things?		You wouldn‚Äôt mind if I just.... take your things, right? 		I wouldn‚Äôt think so.

HR 7115 - ok, so if all semi automatic handguns are banned, why would a Police Officer be allowed to carry one? 	Is any LEO not still a fellow citizen? 	Should they not be equipped to meet their call of duty? 	Well what about us? #2A
@1980reagan Yes. People have mentioned this specific thing to me in person. That is exactly what needs to be done.
@IrishVol69th @Brandi_Lou_79 The Rudolph thing is firmly against bullying though. 	The other reindeer bullied Rudolf, but had to work together for a cause, and then they all lived happily ever after. 	I‚Äôve watched it many times. It‚Äôs a great movie.
It doesn‚Äôt take a machine gun to assault a person. 		This one time I was almost assaulted with a dog bone. You know, one of those giant bones that dogs chew on?  		Sooo, I can readily identify that the proposed bill - HR 7115 is a methodical assault on gun owners and the #2A .
I just read through a proposed bill - HR 7115 and I do not like it.
That‚Äôs Cabot brand, for further reference.

@GhosthuntingCPI All that thing needed was either a grip or a shoulder brace, and a splash guard. It would have worked just fine. 	Sometimes you have to do some trial and error R/D to get to the finish line.
In no way will any cosmetic modification like this, cause the natural mechanical operation of a pistol to be faster. 	That would be dumb.
I think what all those holes are for is an ‚Äúair cooling‚Äù effect when under a sustained rate of fire. 	For me, it‚Äôs going to make my Airsoft Pistol shoot faster. Because it‚Äôs going to be a happier pistol.

Yesterday, I read that in France, protestors are throwing fireworks at the Police. 	You can see explosions directly at the officers before they charge to push back protesters. 	Big booms. Sparks. 	This is all because of an apparent tax on oil/gasoline right?
So basically, members of the ‚Äúcaravan‚Äù were found to have been throwing rocks at Border Patrol agents, who then retaliated with non-lethal counter-measures, by deploying propelled canisters of tear-gas.	Cry if you want. I read about zero casualties so far. 	Continue.

One of the main reasons I currently favor a 1911 over a Glock is because I don‚Äôt like the polymer frame right now. 	I watched a video with a setup that I‚Äôm going to build.	His Glock was bending right in his hands. That is what affected his aim, and his ability to stay on target.

To me, a SBR (short barrel rifle) still isn‚Äôt a rifle unless it is able to use rifle caliber munitions. 	I‚Äôm thinking about how the cartridge can only fit a certain load into it anyway. You‚Äôd lose a lot of velocity over certain distances. 	It wouldn‚Äôt make sense to do that.

@Dismay00 @ollieisyms @BobbySpitzerr @MikeysDead I just picked up a muffin from my local 7/11. It seems to be some kind of pumpkin muffin. It comes equipped with a cream cheese drizzle.
@ollieisyms @Dismay00 @BobbySpitzerr @MikeysDead That‚Äôs the cutest wittle muffin I ever did see. I could never eat such a cute muffin.

@VinceGottalotta It must be horrible for a surgeon or any other medical practitioner, to lose a patient. Their whole career and passion is meant to save a life, and when one false move occurs, everything falls apart. 	Then the families experience that loss, and it‚Äôs just so bad.
@RanaAurora I honestly needed the clarification. I literally was holding a tape measure, looked at the picture, and was confused about the perspective. 	More importantly, I hope she has a full recovery and is in a better place in life.
@RanaAurora @RaeRaeread1 Thank you for pointing that out.

@RebekahWorsham @lisaedwards63 There are guns being moved around unrestricted though. Also being put in the hands of individuals that don‚Äôt know, understand, or even care for what the law is, regardless. 	Obviously those same individuals use it like a blank check to get what they want.
@MakeAmericaMath @gjonesc3 @axios Medical malpractice is a lot different than someone shooting me on purpose for my wallet or something. 		There should be zero people dying from guns. Trust me, I love guns. I know how not to shoot a person. I might even be able to operate. 		And then some.

@ollieisyms Somebody mentioned the person responsible has gone missing. That can mean a few things at this point in time.
@ollieisyms I wish it was some bad CGI but unfortunately there‚Äôs people out there losing homes and maybe getting hurt along the way. 	Hurricanes and tornadoes one thing to have to deal with, but a campfire is something that can be controlled. 	Someone is in some huge trouble.

@telliabear All of the above. Plus Maple Syrup.
@KatTimpf What was the establishment that you were run out of?
@chrisbg99 Double Impact is a sweet ass movie though. Id buy it.
It‚Äôs not like I have a box of 18,000 volt semiconductor just sitting around collecting dust. I need a solar cell, a step up transformer, and a low voltage resonator in a series to power my setup. For health concerns. It‚Äôs crude I know. Probably not FDHA approved.... but it‚Äôll do.
I see this happen more and more in my life. At the bar, at the Walmart, at the phone store paying my bill. 	I can almost not be part of the social structure anymore. 	I feel awkward anyway, but really!!?	Drunks, child abusers, thieves. You...... ohhhh you. I hope you get well.
I had to leave as soon as possible. Maybe in the back of my head I knew I was about to do something horrible. 	Call it illegal, a sin, it would have been bad. And that‚Äôs the worst part. I was sitting there enjoying the place, and that guy ruined it.
It‚Äôs not the most difficult thing you can do in life, but some good advice to you young people would be, to come on in. Enjoy yourself. 	But don‚Äôt piss off that stranger. The one that might be more lost than you think. He‚Äôs so far gone. Nothing can bring him back. He is not here.
If we had to fight, the would‚Äôve been an awful big mess some poor girl would have to clean up. 	I didn‚Äôt want that to be the case. 	There was good people, enjoying that one moment for all they could. 	But someone just wandered into my life, unannounced. My eyes are wide now.
Maybe there‚Äôs a bargaining piece. Maybe property or family is threatened. When that happens, there is little that person can do to resist the temptation. 	Well in the real world, one not clouded by greed, you have the power. The power of will to do as you like. Or as you must.
The moral of the story is this.... a criminal, knows no bounds. 	Nothing will stand in the way when the desire to cause harm, to steal, to rape the innocent, arises. 	Sometimes it‚Äôs commissioned. 		Sometimes a person that‚Äôs down, will be payed to do the dirty work.
I always wonder if someone sent him there. Oooh an assassin?! 	And I‚Äôm not even a high priority target. 	It must‚Äôve been something I said. And someone with the resources had me tracked and followed to my location to threaten me. 	Did I know some kind of information? Beats me man.
Maybe it was a bad neighborhood? No excuses! 	Wherever I set foot is, prime real estate. 	Do you understand, that I did not fight with that person and end his life as he sat next to me, continuing his drunken stupor. 	The opportunity was there many times.
I found myself at a bar many years ago. A young man stumbled in messed up on who knows what. 	The first thing he does, is holds his hand against the back of my head like a gun. He claimed he could‚Äôve shot me dead right there. 	Well he missed. So for years now I still suffer.
We got this Lucifer on Supernatural. I get the impression Luci just wants to have butt sex with Sam. End the world too. His other hobby.
Tax laws and gun laws and drug laws, that were intended for reasons I don‚Äôt understand. I don‚Äôt know what they were thinking. I don‚Äôt need your comprehensive health care package staring at a wall now do I?? 	Duuuuuuuuuh.
Looking at a wall. Looking at a wall. The wall says boo! No it doesn‚Äôt.	See I‚Äôm sober, I don‚Äôt get drunk and I‚Äôm not doing drugs, so I get to look at a wall. 	I‚Äôm sure I could do SOMETHING. Buuuuuut, I blame the people known as Democrats in Illinois. There‚Äôs still crime outside.
The kit costs about $500. Yeah im not going to buy it. 	I‚Äôd probably just make my own. Ohhhhhh manufacturing firearm parts is illegal. Nice fuckin hobby.
That law applies to firearms only. 	I want the thing for my Airsoft gun. Am I to not be allowed to purchase the kit for some reason? 	Ohhh so I need a FOID card and a tax stamp for a reason I wouldn‚Äôt even be violating? Well that‚Äôs dumb. That law is dumb. That legislation is too.
There‚Äôs a product called a Micro Roni. What it does is allows a shooter to put a handgun into a unit to convert into a Carbine configuration. 	Grab a blanky. It has an adjustable stock. Now you require a NFA tax stamp. Otherwise you are breaking the law. 	Well guess what.
@ollieisyms Clowns are scary.
@ollieisyms I‚Äôd call it a burned waffle right now. Cause some jackass doesn‚Äôt know how to make a proper campfire and caused a damn forest fire half a state wide!
@KelemenCari @Cath3rineLSJ That‚Äôs the way I feel too! There‚Äôs too much fakeness about it. I can‚Äôt except the fakeness.
@Harlan Yes I‚Äôm outraged, at least. It‚Äôs a damn election for something important. I take it very seriously.
@damnitbatman Did ya try em out yet?
@DarrellConley14 @ScreamngEagle Wow that looks pretty.
@Megan4MAGA @dsdr2011 Yeah what the heck.
@Pink_About_it @Terrenc43516485 I wonder if she‚Äôll ever pay back the money she‚Äôs getting. 	Otherwise hey, I need a new car, a few Secretary‚Äôs, 6 other full time employees, one of those Vegas Vacations, a pair of boots, and some soda. I‚Äôll pay for the rest of my stuff for now. Vote for me!
Um.....so Most of the state of California looks like it‚Äôs burning. Because of a campfire? 	Whoever is in charge there could probably put that blame game aside and get that wrapped up. Try deploying those new helicopters I was talking about. Yeah the military ones.
Wearing a million dollar helmet of technology surely has its flaws. 	Migraines, aggression, tumors with tumors growing out of their tumors. Foreign militaries out to get their mits on it. 	...... fair enough! I‚Äôll have to run some more ‚Äútests‚Äù. ....
I need a manufacturing company to engineer some parts. There‚Äôs going to be a small market for what I have in mind. 	Maybe the stores just don‚Äôt carry what I‚Äôm looking for. 	There are others like me that want to impulse buy these parts. Must start building now!
I‚Äôve been wondering how people voted back in the day. Was it a show of hands at the nearest TownHall gathering and let the Ayes have it? Was there any dispute about that? 	A currier then delivering the tally via horseback to the Congress? Idk! 	These new ways seem flawed.
@bull_pamela @LindaForAmerica This seems like something that should really be looked into. I don‚Äôt know who would be put on a task like cross checking millions of ballots, but it‚Äôs probably very important. 	You are right though. Truck loads is suspicious, indeed...
Now watching that Evil Dead (the new one) poppin my eyeballs.
@AlwaysActions @jjauthor Yeah........ rich people don‚Äôt actually just give their money to me either. 	It has nothing to do with a persons ethnicity. I am Caucasian. People do not give me money for no reason. 		Sigh. Just kicking a dead horse now. Later.
@Trenton_Hoshiko @CINISTREAM Very cool. I always seem to be busy as well. 	I‚Äôll stayed tuned.
@telliabear Ok. This was brutal. I gave up the heat, because I will dress for success. 	But if I had a choice, I‚Äôd lose the electricity, only if I can utilize solar panels with storage cells. And a pedal bike that charges the cells also. Free workout.
@realDonaldTrump @jodierappkeeton I see what‚Äôs going on. If we can‚Äôt get a fair and honest vote from the election, any tampering or fraud is going to be exposed. Everything is going to become null and void in that case. 	There‚Äôs a chance that millions of people will revolt and protest. 	Maybe. Food for thought.

@Fuctupmind @Julia5180 He was being blackmailed is the way I look at it. None of that is any of my business though. 	Nope, not me at least.
Watching an Indie film about an exorcism. They have a lot of details in order. All the characters are showing me some real to life emotions. 	I think it‚Äôs called 	The Devil Inside. 	So far it is not bad at all.
There currently is a product for paintball that allows a HUD you can use for paintball. But that uses wires. I want this to be Bluetooth. 	Then we‚Äôll get a Tesla coil amplifier to boost the signal. Sure why the hell not right!
Bluetooth technology is amazing. I started working on putting a reticle in my Airsoft mask. Cause why the hell not right? 	Eventually I think I can put an entire HUD in place using my current IPhone once I upgrade. But I can also Bluetooth a round counter into the HUD. Sweet!
@Trenton_Hoshiko I‚Äôm always in the mood to throw you some pitches. See what works for ya.
@Tell_Michelle_ It doesn‚Äôt stop at cars. I was paying my phone bill at the store last night. A group of young men stole up to 4 display phones and a tablet. They ripped them right out and ran out the door. 	I understand it was caught on security camera and should be concluded soon.
@Trenton_Hoshiko I‚Äôve been watching all sorts of horror movies the past two weeks or so, maybe longer. 	Would you be interested in working on a project like that?

@bbusa617 I don‚Äôt think anyone is even disputing that. It‚Äôs just that, they need to go through a simple process of documentation, and that‚Äôs all. 	But we definitely have a problem with people that intend to do cause harm to others. 	I‚Äôve seen video of that type of behavior so far.

@kilo_hjk @CraigRSawyer @TheJusticeDept That‚Äôs interesting. I don‚Äôt recall being shown an actual guide book for the criteria. 	Speech is, by nature unrestricted, so if it CAN be said, it can be said. 	So why the hell are all of this guys posts being censored???
@josephg19712738 Both with apple polishing attorneys that were there for the money I bet.
@josephg19712738 I wonder if that‚Äôs even FDHA approved ! I don‚Äôt recommend it. Messing with melatonin/ ceritonin levels like that is garbage. 	Remember Anna Nicole Smith? Marylin Monroe? Both OD from sleeping/anti depressants.
@josephg19712738 Well, dude was an amazing music artist. There was tabloids claiming he was molesting children and monkeys, and news like that spreads around the playground like fire. 	I definitely suspect malpractice, definitely.
@josephg19712738 And way too much of the stuff too, right? I suspect he became dependent on the drug.
I had my suspicions to begin with, but it is already taught to me that it is in fact a Phonetic language. 	So it‚Äôs possible it may go like this.... 	Ah bah tahl lai bie mee. Just an example. I may have not said anything, other than to describe saying, ‚ÄúA bottle lay by me.‚Äù
I thought ‚ÄúAh why the hell not...‚Äù 		So I‚Äôve begun researching Sanskrit. Pretty soon I‚Äôll get the hang of it. It‚Äôs pretty much a requirement for what I‚Äôll need to years from now.
@RealJamesWoods You must be the only guy on Earth still speaking Sanskrit.
@RealJamesWoods Wow, I never would‚Äôve known. You have a one of a kind way of speaking though. My favorites are anything you do on Family Guy, or Owl Man. Love that sinister tone.
@Steve4721076 @rn_deplorable @Maggieb1B And I‚Äôve smoked multiple bongs. The thought to make fun of  anyone in the military never occurred to me. 	How much, indeed.....
@chuckwoolery @MisterB76428978 soooooooo...... now it‚Äôs some form of vote prostitution? Or something?
@RealJack @RecTherapistVA I am literally not violent unless necessary. 	Go ahead and visit a woman‚Äôs correctional facility sometime. You will see, and hear stories about violence.
@blckriflecoffee It‚Äôs pretty small. Very much the smallest I‚Äôve seen so far.
@BethuneTheory Not sure. I‚Äôm a guy but I do share that interest. Investigation is fun.
@CarlHigbie @nbcsnl @DanCrenshawTX Yeah that‚Äôs not funny. Ass.
@ollieisyms Lol attire. Good one.
@ollieisyms I recommend a little cardio routine for that person. At least one push-up. That would be a great start.
@RealKyleMorris I noticed something here. Her attitude is completely different than everything I‚Äôve ever watched about her so far. She seems a little more relaxed, and I am able to understand what she is saying. 	I agree with some things she is saying here.
@drayzze @TJoefizz As long as you can stay productive. Otherwise a job like that could go extinct.
@Tell_Michelle_ Ha ha and then they ran out of doughnuts... 	oh that Homer. ‚ò∫Ô∏è
While half awake/asleep, I noticed a snippet in the corner of my eye, about the Las Vegas - rte 91 Harvest Festival, the following morning. I almost was unaware it happened. It caught my attention though, and I did a little research about. 	The thing is....
I still feel the same about it. Maybe it‚Äôs the topics certain channels are allowed to report, maybe it‚Äôs the method of reporting, idk. But one thing has been consistent, that I‚Äôm not interested in the program.
So Scott Pilgrim vs. The World is really good. This sucker has some effects going on I think are unparalleled thus far. With a relatable story to back it up too. They really put together a one of a kind movie experience.
Lol ‚ÄúI got dibs on missing college girls.‚Äù 		Dibbies! That‚Äôs a win.
Piranha on The Rabbit. Ving Rhames in da hoooouse. 		So far (3 minutes in) so good. I see this as a good movie. Piranhas are gruesome too.
#Hellraiser is on here. This movie is so spot on. 		Catch an interview with Pinhead at @SlasherRadio

@Dismay00 @ollieisyms I have nearly 23 hours to take my shirt off.... I‚Äôll contact HQ. radio for backup.
@dbongino My imagination is displaying a pair of F-14‚Äôs and a B-2 with the caption, 	‚ÄúI have your lawsuit right here, ready to file.‚Äù 	And we all know what I really mean.
@thebradfordfile Lol yeah republicans want the votes. Not fake ones. Not dead people votes. Not foreigners votes. Just a fair game vote.
@thebradfordfile There was a tax cut I remember happening. What also happened with that money is it went straight to raises for employees and even bonus pay for many. 	Disenfranchisement of voters has no meaning to me. People vote if and when they want. Unless the polls are rigged. Mmmmmm?
@bpmobileapps Yes, I would like to record a call one day. And I appreciate the effort put forth with the pretty lady. Thanks!
@mpg25mary @Germantownrunne @RebekahWorsham @POTUS I find myself in that situation. I put in 6-9 hours of dedicated work time everyday. When I‚Äôm done there‚Äôs all sorts of stuff I wish I could be doing. But I find out certain things happen, and I need to know more about it. Hours can go by, I still won‚Äôt know everything.
@KatieMarovitch Yeah well... I have broken teeth. If I owned a mirror I‚Äôd smash that bitch straight apart. No happy face for me.
@zaku1982 There‚Äôs a beer, longing for the taste of your lips. The pleasing sensation of your insides. The release. Until next time. ‚úåÔ∏è
@Splash0fGinge @ollieisyms I feel like it would cost more in the packaging, than candy product. It doesn‚Äôt make sense. 	Also doubting that wrapper is eco-friendly. 	It‚Äôs one of my favorite candies though. Love those tasty bastards.
@ollieisyms @telliabear I accept and appreciate your criticism.
@ollieisyms @telliabear Hold...... I will not be having sex with a goat. I just want that to be clear.
@ollieisyms @telliabear Ill ram Jenna Jameson too. Just like the goat if need be.
@ollieisyms @telliabear Oh I will doo oo oo ooo it alright. 		(The oo oo is a goat sound. If were talking in person, I would have imitated a goat sound, and it may have been funny.)
@ollieisyms @telliabear I‚Äôll ram that possessed goat right back. I‚Äôll show IT not to play with Ouija boards.
@ollieisyms @telliabear Awwwww possessed goats are the cutest
@HillaryClinton I just watched some interesting video footage.	What I actually prefer to repudiate, is people that throw rocks and firebombs at police. 	If I had a choice, I would have nothing to do with those people.  	I‚Äôm sure that soon, they will be released into the country. 	Nice, huh?
@SarahPalinUSA Mmmmmmm..... that guy makes me want to say horrible things. Stuff that would probably get me arrested in some way.
@ollieisyms @telliabear I‚Äôd check that house out. I ain‚Äôt afraid of no ghost.
@telliabear @ollieisyms I would do em all. But the hospital usually has abandoned medical equipment. Maybe even discarded patients. I think that‚Äôs spooky.
@Arnezie2 @BoSnerdley I saw her picture and wondered why she wasn‚Äôt wearing one. 	So to me, it seems that would cause conflict with people of that faith. Also considering the situation concerning people of that faith being so Anti-Christian and Jewish. I really think there‚Äôs problems afoot. Doins.
@BethuneTheory There‚Äôs a Halloween marathon on Rabbit. It‚Äôs very exciting.
Halloween (2018) Pitch Meeting https://t.co/GP4z0SG8qS via @YouTube		Because today. 		Happy Halloween everyone.
So I just finished honing my blades. I use them throughout the day for all sorts of things I need to cut apart or open. But now, they are so nice, that I will cut time itself. 	I‚Äôm so exhausted, must‚Äôve done something right.
@Maxou_AbwFr Lukee(Sp?) games? I think it‚Äôs an online retailer, does offer the retro line of games for low prices. They may have something to meet your budget.
@Maxou_AbwFr The DS version also offers some additional areas to explore, new more powerful weapons and armor, additional arena section, and more! 	The storyline. The lore behind it, and the overall enjoyable experience is something to be remembered forever.
@RichLogis There‚Äôs women on my followers list here, that probably shoot better than me. And raise kids and work a job all week. They deserve a magazine too.

@TonyBoscoe @CocoThePatriot @ari_russian I just researched ‚Äúbrown shirts‚Äù I have a good idea of what you mean now. 	Definite revision of that law is needed.
The boxed Chrono Trigger has literally survived through time with me. It‚Äôs been hell.
@Maxou_AbwFr @fritztalgia @GeekWithThat @Kuniotchi @BossVsNoob @wrytersview @x8Finity @BigBossGun @8bitp1xelz @theWellRedMage @ColonelFalcon @RetroGamingDev Everything about is my favorite. I was able to have Chrono Cross ordered at a video game store a few years ago, and still have to play it through. It‚Äôs an epileptic nightmare at first.... but it‚Äôs really great. I love the series. https://t.co/sFcUH0aM6B
@TonyBoscoe @CocoThePatriot @ari_russian Well I don‚Äôt see how that helps you in any way. There‚Äôs no sense of logic in having a fine imposed on you like that. Whatever legislation is in affect concerning it, should be immediately removed, until revision, and you should be absolved of the fine and/or reimbursed in full.
@FranSism1g @Trumpology911 That‚Äôs a pretty good segment. I don‚Äôt really know why it would be deleted. But they did? Well that‚Äôs ludicrous then.
@JewhadiTM @Trumpology911 I want a vintage Dodge Charger. Not gonna happen.
@JackPosobiec Yeah exactly. That‚Äôs two specific cases of tragedy that could‚Äôve been avoided.
@passantino Not true. There‚Äôs a laundry list of things to worry about. It‚Äôs an invasion in a relative sense. Someone can come get me, whenever possible. 	At this time the ‚Äúinvasion‚Äù appears to be unarmed. It does resort to rock throwing and property destruction, through primitive means.
Ended up watching Texas Chainsaw Massacre - The Beginning,last night. 		That‚Äôs one brutal movie. Of course Gunnie, R Lee Ermie plays a Sheriff that leaves me thinking..... but I hold true to my belief, that out on the road trips, no one can be trusted.
@JacobAWohl @PredictionMan I‚Äôve read all sorts of things about what happened in Vegas that time. It‚Äôs a mess of details really. Also many things seemed to be covered up about it. So obviously someone didn‚Äôt WANT certain things to be in known, but are.
@ozyrobbie19 @CarlForrest @bobstroup Ya know it‚Äôs nice to see an animal that actually looks vicious and grotesque for a change. Very cool. ‚úåÔ∏è

@RubinReport @LauraLoomer @jack The day of reckoning will be upon us when the ‚ÄúTweet‚Äù button is removed and left with only a ‚Äúlike‚Äù button. 	No longer will we debate or comment profusely, but we will like all things! All things will be liked! Likes will be liked! . AaaaaAnd then the universe implodes.
@AmyMek @Terrenc43516485 According to that guy, trees speak in English instead of, I am Groot.
@AmyMek @Terrenc43516485 The guy even said multiple times, that they have to fight in Palestine. Not in America. Over there, in Palestine.
@LauraLoomer @jack A person would have to be a real shmuck to buy those ornaments to put on a Christmas tree or whatever else.  	That lady is really craY lately.
@realDonaldTrump @RealTT2020 I started buying only Blu-ray. The quality in hi-def resolution that we are capable of is completely worth it. There‚Äôs classics that demand that grainy film texture though. I‚Äôm not willing to compromise on that. 	Media. Pssshh.
@KatTimpf I‚Äôm already 35 ish. I do my own laundry and everything. Rock on. ‚úåÔ∏è
@LauraLoomer I think everyone is Jewish whether they know it or not. Even if they think they aren‚Äôt. Still Jewish. 	Like the Energizer Bunny has a choice? No. He bangs the drum and keeps going. Just like the Sun rises and sets. Jewish. Enjoy yourself.
@XStrategiesDC Ok so, IF these are the migrant caravan people, why would I want them anywhere near me? 	And IF I was able to offer them a job, why would I? They look like they cause damage to property and throw rocks. 	And IF they are given a welfare check, I want $50,000 for good behavior.
The past becomes the past now. Time to kill zombies.
@srpimpbrian @CarlForrest That would suck so bad. I bet that dude has a few cracked ribs at least. 	Must‚Äôve been a mechanical malfunction or something.
@Education4Libs @CocoThePatriot Yeah exactly, St. Peter is a at huge gate that reviews your life history so far. Huge wall too. None shall pass, it‚Äôs such a huge wall. 	Single file line. Body cavity searches, inside and out. Dental records, physical exams. Inoculations. 	No trespassing.
@Education4Libs @CocoThePatriot Yeah I don‚Äôt see why they would be turned away. Every single one of those people are going to have to fill out a bunch of paperwork and stuff. There‚Äôs probably questions that need answers and identification processes and interpreters that are overworked and underpaid and such.
@chrisbg99 I wish it went like this. Many years ago I found a purse on the ground at a grocery store. I immediately returned it to the owner that was nearby. 	She thanked me wholeheartedly, and later, at the checkout hands me like $20. 	And that was a cool thing.
@chrisbg99 I don‚Äôt know, maybe I should just notify a manager or security if I see it again.
@chrisbg99 Also, how would I know if that lady doesn‚Äôt send her kid off to provoke assistance to later claim I‚Äôll intent? 	But there‚Äôs good simaritin laws out there that would be a crime if I did NOT help. So it would seem I‚Äôm at fault either way no matter what I could do.
@chrisbg99 I thought about that too. That would be disputed. I had no intention of harming a child or seeking the kid in the first place. 	This kid was distraught. Crying. Out in the open. I tried to help find her parent and that‚Äôs all. 	I really sucks to see the kid get hit like that.
I will snap. 	So be a better a parent. Keep a good eye on those kids for me. Be careful out there. ‚úåÔ∏è
So, I‚Äôm meditating on the matter for a minute. Rehearsing the details. 	I generally don‚Äôt see this type of thing in a public place, or am I truly accustomed to scolding a child in a moment of rejoice. 	No I‚Äôm pretty sure, almost 100%, that the next time I see it happen...
Is that modern parenting? Is it really right? As people, should  we not show concern for lost children? 	I avoided a hate crime really. The impulse to attack the parent , to defend the child shot through my brain, but it would have been so bad. I wouldn‚Äôt have made it home.
My nerve was struck right to the core. 	What the hell. The things I‚Äôve been thinking now. Just trying to do some me quick shopping. Kill some time. 	Hardly would I expect it even plan to see a literal cabbage patch looking little kid get smacked like that. 	I saw it. I‚Äôm hot now.
Now I‚Äôm searching for an available employee, being careful not to lose sight of the lost child. 	And in that very moment the child located her mommy. 		‚ÄúOh good‚Äù I thought. But no right before my eyes I see her mom slap her across the head and scolded the little girl.
...... ok .... it‚Äôs ok we‚Äôre gonna find mommy. Don‚Äôt worry. Where was she last? 		I can‚Äôt remember. 		What‚Äôs her coat look like? 		I don‚Äôt know. 		Ok what‚Äôs mommy‚Äôs name. 	I got the name. Redacted for privacy. 		What we need is an employee, they can call her, no problem.
I was at the Walmart. I was on my way to the checkout. My attention happened upon a little girl walking hastily alone. She must‚Äôve been 3 maybe 5 years old. 	She‚Äôs frantic. 	‚ÄúLittle girl where‚Äôs your parents?‚Äù I asked.	‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know, I can‚Äôt find my mommy.‚Äù She replied.
@LauraLoomer @megynkelly Purple people!! Yes!
Friday the 13th on The Rabbit. 		@SlasherRadio
@mitchellvii @Trumpology911 I don‚Äôt think crazy people know or think they themselves are crazy. That‚Äôs pretty much according to who‚Äôs making that observation. 	We all have our moments, for sure, and it would take a real crazy person to deny being crazy. And that‚Äôs a pickle for ya. 	The libs are nuts though.
@realJHCollazo @BotnPaidFor @RonDeSantisFL Who the hell let her out of what kitchen? ??		She should be at home doing laundry instead of picking up signs. 		Maybe she thinks her vote equals how many signs she collected.
@LauraLoomer Yeah but, she‚Äôs feckless. She is without feck.
@realJHCollazo @BotnPaidFor @RonDeSantisFL There are some straightforward sexist remarks I can be saying right now. 	Let me know if you want it, and I‚Äôll lay it on you. I‚Äôve got a couple juicy ones brewin. ‚úåÔ∏è
@LauraLoomer @LouisFarrakhan @jack Really though, that‚Äôs a dumb thing to do, referring to Jewish people as termites. 	Not dumb, in a way that invokes revenge either. It‚Äôs so dumb, I don‚Äôt care to waste time thinking about it. Laughably dumb. üòÇ bow tie! Ohhh man.
@LauraLoomer @LouisFarrakhan @jack Termites can survive an apocalypse. In a biblical sense, the meek inherit the Earth. 	The bow tie failed to make him smarter. ü§ì
@PeterRosianul That‚Äôs great! I can‚Äôt stand drunk drivers, also the ones that drive too close behind me. It‚Äôs so aggravating.
@PredictionMan Also, abortion is dumb.
@PredictionMan Personally, I can see myself revolting against that tradition. Just like any life or death situation, the spoil goes to the victor.
@slutsnguts She rules. Labyrinth is a favorite of mine. It‚Äôs like she‚Äôs digitally imprinted in my cortex.
Then you can move all your attention and effort into screwing those pieces into place, where you obtained the original measurement, and deal with your back pain as you do so. Aaaaaaand that‚Äôs being a carpenter for a moment. You will return. Make sure you clean up the mess. ‚úåÔ∏è
Once you have all the tools, the time, the material, and you make that mark, and you grit your teeth and push that saw, you have a variance the thickness of a piece of paper you‚Äôre willing to cope with.
things together, and then another half hour cursing, while I debate whether I want to use this brand new plywood, or really just settle on piecing together some scraps. The ensuing rain helped make my decision, so I put everything on hold. 	And when the time comes, Remember.
So I needed to cut a piece of plywood to make some pieces to cover up some holes on a barn. It never evades me what‚Äôs necessary to do so. I will need a pencil, a measuring tape, a square, a straight edge, a saw, a cord and electricity, saw horses, nearly an hour to get these...
@MiddleAgedMaMa2 Ninor the Fury. Hoarder of nachos and doors. Very cool.
@RealSaavedra @dbongino I have NO idea what she is talking about!
@kelly_ramona @Politick_Rick I wonder what they‚Äôre gonna do?? Paperwork could take months to fill out and pass through its respective processes.
@dbongino Which is wierd, because it‚Äôs basically human nature to travel freely, push boundaries, be rebellious against governing forces, and live according to ones own will.
@kwilli1046 @Maggieb1B I think the people are responsible for the economy. The people buy products and hire services when needed according to their own free will.
@pahubb43 @babysgramma I saw a report somewhere that upwards of 5 trillion dollars disappeared a few months ago. There should most definitely be money. It‚Äôs just a simple wall so many people require. For security and stuff.
@JJShurte @Last_Librarian It‚Äôs such a great game. From that epic stormy night to the credits running through to the last horn of the fanfare. It‚Äôs soooo good.
@RedPillBlackMan @BarryWa59952409 @realDonaldTrump I don‚Äôt know. I have a voter registration card. And I still have to show ID to get a ballot. Thems the rules.

@AngelFoxToday71 That‚Äôs some Def Leopard.
@RdNkAngel1989 @_thehaunting @netflix @StephenKing Way better atmosphere than House on Haunted Hill, the more recent movie. 	Of course Vincent Price is a legend, but they really have great camera work going on. And creepy old lady.
@CraigRSawyer I may not use Facebook, but I think you should be able to express yourself freely about this. 	Kidnapping and trafficking of a minor is a serious offense. 	Stifling your progress leads me to think that the company is aiding a felonious group of conspirators.
@RdNkAngel1989 @_thehaunting @netflix @StephenKing I just started watching this too, through rabbit that Bonezzz showed me. These Ghosts are pretty creepy.
@freedom_moates @dc_chronicle It‚Äôs homemade porn.

@kashthefuturist @L0B033 I wonder if the person that photographed the kid just left it sleep on an empty jug, or offered it a pillow or something. 	In my lifetime I have literally given a person a pillow that didn‚Äôt have one. Given out blankets, food, rides. 	But no one helped that kid did they?

@RdNkAngel1989 What‚Äôs going on?
@telliabear I know what that is like. Also being blamed for others wrongdoing. It‚Äôs a complete Bi-pass of due process. It‚Äôs unacceptable really.
@damnitbatman That‚Äôs so harsh. She was so young. And the crime scene was brutal from what I‚Äôve seen.
@JackPosobiec Well..... I don‚Äôt have cable TV... I think it‚Äôs a really bad idea to get rid of Roseanne like that, and the jokes are too smarty pants for me right now. 	Maybe I‚Äôm not the demographic, but my family and I always get along a lot better than that family does. 	I‚Äôll watch #TWD tho.
@mitchellvii @124_dw I‚Äôd just name all my horses ‚ÄúCan‚Äôt-lose‚Äù. The race is clinched for sure!
@damnitbatman I watched a documentary. Isn‚Äôt it suspected that her parents or close relative is to blame?
@ChrisEvans It‚Äôs probably the best way to carry a child too. You can see them and they can see you. Keeps the worry level to a minimum.
@GroovyBruce With dramatic overtone - 		Run? I‚Äôm through with running. The Deadites attack and I see nothing but meatless piles of bones, fit for the scrap yard! 	No, on this day we stand. We shall fight back. On this day, we shall see victory!
@RdNkAngel1989 Oh..... well, may as well just shrug it off and enjoy the game best you can.
@dbongino People have been saying her clearance should be removed for months, maybe years. 	Look at that picture. Does she not look crazy?
@RdNkAngel1989 Talk that shit back. Give em hell.

@Germantownrunne @RebekahWorsham @POTUS I really can‚Äôt relate to anything they put out. 	There‚Äôs a locally printed paper by me, I find some interesting tid bits all the time.
Historical knowledge is pretty difficult to maintain and pass on. We used to use hieroglyphics. Then papyrus. Then hemp paper. Then paper. Then audio video recording. Then computer files. Then social media. 	And those crystal skulls. 		But it can all get wiped out instantly. Eek.
@SpaceCorpsUS So by the Democrat logic, and I‚Äôve said this before - Everyone is guilty of every crime right now, with no evidence or witnesses at all. And that‚Äôs dumb. Really really dumb.
@SpaceCorpsUS Well yesterday I was dealing with the power outage at the house here. Today a credit card payment refuses to go through to pay my phone bill. The game I started playing is constantly crashing with server issues, an abrupt season change is killing me, and those people do THAT? üôà

@telliabear Do you mean your cat will often look around the room at things that not visible to you? 	I‚Äôve read into it years ago. Apparently cats, have the ability to visually perceive, what experts in the paranormal field believe to be...... other dimensions, maybe even ghosts.

Schizophrenia or insanity has definitive symptoms. If that lady eventually claims that, I don‚Äôt think she suits the bill. 	She‚Äôs obviously not insane, she‚Äôs responding to questions, she‚Äôs drinking coffee, she drove a car. 	She could have signs of regression. That‚Äôs all.

There‚Äôs a website that has information available about this event. A still frame photo shows a Brazilian woman, who was member of a gang. 	The video I watched had a woman that looked similar, with differences. Does that mean anything to you?
@Juliana_Remy That‚Äôs pretty much what I gather as well. They just.... resist. üòê *shrug*
@SpaceCorpsUS That‚Äôs a rather high number. Its probably not easy to notice by clothing alone.
Wow. The Police effort in that area has lowered gang activity almost 20% in just 3 years. That‚Äôs a massive improvement.
This happened back in January of 2018. At least the body was found at that time. 	I‚Äôve read into it.
@CA_Psychic Months ago. I sat in my chair and saw it. I thought I was going crazy. Today I watched it on video right before my eyes. There was nothing I could do. 	Everyone has a choice over their  own actions. They chose poorly.
No. Nobody deserves that. 		Come on let‚Äôs go get our feet wet and hands dirty. My schedule is cleared. Ready and waiting.
Hey we can save the trees at the same time! 	It‚Äôs too late to save the girl. For some reason we were made to see what happened. This will not be forgotten.
@SarahPalinUSA She has limited mental capacity. Don‚Äôt hate. Just vote for someone else.
Hmm... just watched a girl get stabbed a bunch of times while her head cut off. 	Well, obviously someone video taped it. So their location and affiliation is now known. 	Karma comes in many forms. Sound off.

The opening scene has enough gun shooting to top a wedding cake. It‚Äôs a shame they had to get the discount Christopher Walken. This movie needed the real thing. 	A Norris / Walken movie?? 	On Earth? 	Not yet. 	Write your local Congress-person and tell them what you require.

@IanMFish @RightWingAshley We will probably need functioning fallout suits soon.
@NOiardo @mashable I totally felt bad. It‚Äôs given a job and they just keep getting in its way....
@mashable That robot will learn to hate its creator. And the guy with the stick.
@jimwelch1 @crickafer00 @walkingwater70 I can‚Äôt even believe it. The name alone, and everything it‚Äôs about is flagrantly absent of intelligence though. 	I am proudly not a member.
@ArsiniegaAlfred South side of Chicago myself. 	It‚Äôs tentative, but Far Beyond Driven tickles me more.
@ArsiniegaAlfred I miss them dearly.
@ArsiniegaAlfred I still am.
Did the THE SOCKS show Police as pigs? Or pigs as Police? 	It probably doesn‚Äôt matter once you‚Äôve made up your mind.
@ArsiniegaAlfred That sounds about right to me. A choice well made!
@ArsiniegaAlfred Not even on a Tuesday.
@ArsiniegaAlfred Great President though. He‚Äôs really taking care of business. 	I watched him talk at one of his rallies, while it was on tv. He actually sat down and had a nice chat with the folks. Very heartwarming.
@ArsiniegaAlfred It‚Äôs not even proper to bow like that. Lol that‚Äôs so odd.
@proguerra @DeepStateExpose @jeranism Up to 12 years ago, a photograph of a piece of a plane behind a warehouse door was in front of my eyes. It‚Äôs being guarded by the best, for whatever reasons. That doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs THE plane. 	I wouldn‚Äôt expect an exploded plane to be intact much. It looked like fair condition.
@Juliana_Remy No kidding! I looked at it. I thought.... everyone in the back is looking down pretty much. Then I scrolled down. Very odd indeed!
@LauraLoomer @The_StormIsHere @EdMorrissey Hell yeah. I was pretty surprised to see you Loomered that thing in Washington. It would have been a lot cooler if they didn‚Äôt remove you in such a jerky way. 	You still have the passion about you, though. That‚Äôs what matters.
The Ninth Gate is an interesting film. Starring Johnny Depp. It‚Äôs more of an adventure than a movie. 	It features an amazing score, throughout. Twists and turns, and thought provoking mythology. 	Bring a friend.
@GoodsTasha Hidey ho neighbor! 		Yes. Outstanding idea. 		Those talks with Wilson on Home Improvement were always the best. This could rival that greatness and even improve. Yes.
@proguerra @DeepStateExpose @jeranism Not really. It would be super easy, barely an inconvenience. 	Yeah people are going to talk about how horrible it was for a few months before they realize they have to get back to their own lives. Then there‚Äôs going to be a foreign conflict, while the evidence is disposed of.
If you aren‚Äôt aware that a couple of people were in the crowd warning those people, then make yourself abundantly aware at this time. 	A brief description gives me an idea of who it was. 	Now purple your monkey dishwasher.
I‚Äôm thinking about the situation, and there‚Äôs just so many things I want to say about it. All the possibilities that may have occurred. 	Any ordinary law abiding citizen, would be entirely inclined to inform local law enforcement of a possible shooting. There‚Äôs no way around it.
See it wasn‚Äôt just a simple massacre. There were so many arranged details, they can‚Äôt even be listed without a thorough explanation. Days on end of details. 	You deserve this much.
Die hard truth seekers may find that the tree was presawn. One swipe of my trusty spoon is sure to bring it down. If no one is around to see it, then I have got a tall tale to tell! 		Thank you
Sarcasm alert : I can chop down a cherry tree, with a spoon!
Days later, an initial examination of ammunition, shows fingerprints of her description. 	‚ÄúYes I put them there.‚Äù She said. 	But it‚Äôs ok, she worked for the FBI. 	As usual the FBI has the right legally defend themselves, as well.
‚ÄúWhat are you doing here?‚Äù The arresting officer may have asked.	‚ÄúWell I came here from the Phillipenes, to visit my boyfriend‚Äù she would say. 	‚ÄúWe like to buy houses....‚Äù
So the accused, now diseased, allegedly, has a girlfriend, that he wires a hundred thousand dollars to foreign account, and she was found alive in a parking garage in the area, around the time of a mass shooting, with little to no explanation.
@Terrenc43516485 Lol, that was funny. 		But people like us really expect all the facts right? 	We were promised all the facts maybe later this year. 	I hope we get all the goodies.
Juicy. https://t.co/CBRekwA98I
@Terrenc43516485 No other bodies mentioned in the FIT report
@Terrenc43516485 Absolutely. Ok I thought pretty much that same thing a few weeks ago too.
@Terrenc43516485 Well that is interesting. That does not seem like something, someone completely uninvolved with a scenario like that would do.
I‚Äôm outside. Coffee at hand. Crickets everywhere. It‚Äôs like they‚Äôre telling me something..... hmmmm. Yes there IS rain in the area..... yes I CAN smell the dew point dropping.... hmmmm.....interesting....
@Terrenc43516485 But she talked on end, about the relationship those two had, and basically her life story up to that point. No mention of working for the FBI! That seems like highly prevalent information that should have been discussed.
@Terrenc43516485 Know what I mean? When the room was breached, and from that one can footage I heard a ‚Äúheeeelp ‚Äú from another room. 	That was never discussed so far.
@Terrenc43516485 After reading the FIT report, I believe no all the facts have been laid on the table.	The report does not state clearly where Danley was at the time of the shooting. 	Was that her in the other room saying ‚Äúhelp‚Äù, I wonder?
@LauraLoomer That auctioneer routine I saw was annoying. There you were with firsthand testimony and there‚Äôs some guy being a jerk for no reason. It really irritates me.
@Terrenc43516485 I think you are correct. It seems that way after looking through the pile of information. 	If there was anything that could‚Äôve been done to stop it. That would‚Äôve been the way to go.
@Terrenc43516485 And then she makes a clean getaway, 100 large richer, now in the Phillies? Mmmm? 	No this is far from forgotten yet.
@Terrenc43516485 Nah that‚Äôs a pretty big deal. Do you think it was a fraudulent claim? Or maybe undercover? That‚Äôs a real sticky situation. Who‚Äôs to say she didn‚Äôt secretly influence Paddock to shoot the crowd, if it were proven that he did. All she had to do is boldly lie to the interviewer.
@Education4Libs @RecTherapistVA We need the Parthenon.
@LivPsy @Dismay00 I plan on being part of a time travel program. It involves researching crimes, going back and stopping them entirely. The trick is that it won‚Äôt affect the continuum. Victims and innocent bystanders will just win. I think that would be cool.
@blckriflecoffee Well........ yeah!

The story about Seth Rich is that he was murdered. He may have coincidentally, known some kind of information. https://t.co/CUVn4NtxCm
@intellihubnews I hope and pray this kind of thing does not happen.
Night mode is badass. Oh that‚Äôs good stuff.
If it‚Äôs not possible already, one thing I wish I could do with twitter is change the background and font color. All white background is too bright. I just don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs changeable.
@RdNkAngel1989 That looks like an auto generated response of some kind.
There is no difference. They are both priceless. Treat the shoes like it‚Äôs your only pair. Treat the woman like she is a gift from the Heavens.
So apparently, people were burning the shoes because an endorsee was chosen and he has his own viewpoints on things. Particularly, he is anti law enforcement, and such. 	We lost in-country manufacturing. Dirty politics. 	Dirty.
How about, why the hell did you buy the shoes in the first place? You thought those Nike shoes were so top notch but, today, on this day, they are better set ablaze? 	Wallets and purses are made overseas too. Better burn it.
What‚Äôs the price difference, between a really nice pair of shoes you‚Äôd take good care of, and a blowjob you won‚Äôt soon forget?
Think about the weddings. The funerals. Those fancy things. Jesus‚Äôs birthday. 	Those shoes and I walk in the room and you damn well better gasp. You know it.
I spent $60 on a pair of Calvin Clein dress shoes before. I have worn them up to 11 times since I‚Äôve owned them. Purchased nearly 7 years ago. 	They have not failed to impress me. 	There‚Äôs no real reason I would burn them though. It‚Äôs leather. Don‚Äôt be ridiculous.
@DeepStateExpose @Trumpology911 So I‚Äôve watched this video many times. It is similar to one found in a collection that was brought to my attention. The other ones have planes in them though, but there‚Äôs a difference with the angles of approach is all I‚Äôm saying right now. I realize they have different vantage.
The real world is not a room in an office building. Some of these Senators really need to get out there. Walk the streets. Get lost in the woods and find their way free. Experience life, and get an idea of what it‚Äôs about. 	I wish them luck.
@Cocoa_Bean10 @FireUpMAGAKAG @BreitbartNews There isn‚Äôt a chance in Hell one of these migrants can illustrate the justification of raping a boy because he eats pork. Which is what I gather from the situation. 	I feel bad for the little dude.
@MatBest11x @blckriflecoffee I ran out of creamer pre Labor Day. I STILL had coffee. I STILL drank that coffee. But tonight...... after the mission to Walmart, I am complete.
@RyanAFournier @PeterRosianul That‚Äôs a good looking ad too. It really grabs me by the patriotism gland. 	Does Nike make dress shoes?
Repurposed? Burning rubber is probably bad for the environment. The shoes still had use. 	Boycotting just means you don‚Äôt buy the products for whatever reason. 	Calm down you dirty politics!!	Dirty!!
Ok shoes. I‚Äôm wearing these Avia brand shoes from Walmart. They cost me less than $20, I‚Äôm going to get so much use out of them. I‚Äôm on the extreme budget, so I‚Äôm good. 	But I see some guy is burning his Nike shoes? Isn‚Äôt there rubber in that? And other materials that can be....
@TrumpNewsz It‚Äôs not because of Kavanaugh, that‚Äôs for sure. 	Otherwise, that means there‚Äôs an armed posse that‚Äôs going to be killing people because of him being confirmed? 	Well..... that‚Äôs not smart at all!
@LauraLoomer I don‚Äôt approve of ANY genital mutilation. 	As a Lillithist, I‚Äôm completely against that one law you just said too. The name itself is icky. I won‚Äôt even repeat such blasphemy.
Crisis averted. The veil of doubt was lifted and I see now. God was there, when I was given the urge to go outside and patrol for that moment. 	If it had gone all night, by morning we would have seen some damage. 	In the end, the fix was made, and somebody got be a hero.	Amen
@ollieisyms @ErikHandy Rumors of a full length feature film caught my attention within the last two years. Anyone else?
@80sjams I‚Äôm glad you said that. Coincidentally, porcupines, are said to be the one mammal, that  procreates more than any other. I‚Äôve seen numbers thrown around like 127 times a mating season. Oooh that‚Äôs sexy.
@RdNkAngel1989 No casualties here. I tried to make the day run smoothly. 	We had a rainstorm and possible tornado conditions in the area though. 	We could have been whisked away to a far off magical land. 	Very exciting.
@area51F That persons questions were asked in an attempt to provoke you too. 	In my experience in life, questions are asked, to obtain knowledge. 	Nope. I do not enjoy talking to people like that.
@CAoutcast @LazyMeatball My beard doesn‚Äôt have time for what liberals have decided to think for a moment.
@damnitbatman That song plays in my head when I shop at stores. Or the mission impossible theme sometimes. 	I‚Äôm the secret agent of grocery shopping.
We had quite a bit of rain today. I‚Äôm not the type of person that has a problem with that. It‚Äôs really a shame though, that it actually does make completing a job more difficult for some people. If we had the proper funding, I can see ways to make improvements.
@Amica Make fire. Cook food. Eat food.
@GeekyZombieKing @Kotaku I‚Äôm not. For me, these games just started. They are great.
@LivPsy @Dismay00 There‚Äôs usually room for improvement. So keep a positive attitude nonetheless. No you‚Äôre right.
@The1FunkyBunch @DeepStateExpose @Trumpology911 Thank you for getting back to me so soon with this. I‚Äôm probably going to be watching it multiple times.
@RdNkAngel1989 I understand. It happens so suddenly sometimes. The shops won‚Äôt even be able to service this disaster till after the holiday. Are you going to be ok? https://t.co/PGzJSR7ReO
Attention, all badasses. There is a situation that requires assistance here. Check it out. https://t.co/ko44D4iLxY
@The1FunkyBunch @DeepStateExpose @Trumpology911 I‚Äôve seen a few of those too. It‚Äôs a really horrible thing to watch. There‚Äôs some audio files from the distress calls. Those are sick. 	Is there anything in particular you‚Äôd recommend watching for comparison?
I agree with her. Murphy‚Äôs Law is bullshit.
@Lrihendry So from now on, anything that can go well, will go well. 	Yeah!
Nausea, indigestion, ultra depression. I‚Äôve got it made baby!!
@RdNkAngel1989 @Irelandreid It‚Äôs pretty suspicious when a perfectly good tire goes flat. The one I‚Äôm dealing with looks like someone kicked the valve stem so hard, or pulled it loose.
@RdNkAngel1989 @Irelandreid This happened to me too.
Aaaaaaaaand I‚Äôm done.
And it‚Äôs not my parents fault. They are and always were the greatest parents.
Your cgi offends me. People died. You made up lies with a computer graphic software. You are a horrible group of people.
But he said he‚Äôs praying for me? I appreciate it. It just doesn‚Äôt work. Do I just not see it? I see all things, but I don‚Äôt see anything. I do not see anything that should be seen. I see garbage and decay, and literal excrement. I see laughter, but I see nothing funny.
A buddy calls me on the phone. I told him my story. It‚Äôs not that messed up, but it‚Äôs messed up enough. There‚Äôs nothing entirely proper about anything. 	The movies suck. I don‚Äôt shut my mind off for a damn thing. The producers suck. They won‚Äôt get my money. Their movies are dumb.
Trust me. I could drive a car into a ton of people. Through store fronts. Into parked cars. Right into the doors. It‚Äôs not like that‚Äôs difficult at all. 	I can‚Äôt believe I haven‚Äôt done that yet!! 	And I still haven‚Äôt pissed on a fire hydrant! Asshole!
This guy. He clearly said he didn‚Äôt even know what the order was. But somehow, just a moment later, he knew it was all wrong. The whole order was messed up. And he got a $6 discount or something. 	Maybe it‚Äôs a gray area?? I don‚Äôt know!!
Not hitting. Not hurting in anyway. I‚Äôm not trying to kill anyone. Not trying to take advantage of anyone. I was always honest. But I was standing there, literally watching a guy lie straight to the clerks face. For what seemed like a $6 discount. It was bizarre.
I wasn‚Äôt on the street hitting people. That‚Äôs all we read about and that was what was important. Why are people doing these things I wondered? 	So I studied the stuff, we talked, but I‚Äôm just some asshole. I can‚Äôt do anything about it. So there‚Äôs one more thing. It‚Äôs pointless.
I‚Äôm just going through the days, as sober as can be! And it does nothing for me. 	I see no point in what I do anymore, but it just keeps going. 	I was dedicated to the cause. I just kept doing it, and I can‚Äôt understand why anymore.
I am having a mental breakdown. It might last awhile. It‚Äôs going to look ridiculous. If you need to stop following my twitter thing, please do so. This way I will at least know where we stand and I will do the same.
I can‚Äôt go eat a damn meal, without something going wrong, can I? What explanation for this can there possibly be? 	Whatever did what to that tire, doesn‚Äôt even have the balks to admit it. 	What do we call it? Is it God? Was God watching out for the tire? I am now in doubt.
You just couldn‚Äôt let it go, could you?
I can‚Äôt remember celebrating anything for over a decade. There‚Äôs a few hours in the year I‚Äôve visited a family member. That‚Äôs about it.
No, on this holiday weekend, just like everyday for the past year and a half and them some, I get to only do a bunch of work for someone. Nothing else.
@freedom_moates @PeterRosianul I didn‚Äôt see a plane.
@DeepStateExpose @Trumpology911 I really don‚Äôt see a plane anywhere. So I went and watched a few times. Not even a wing hanging loose or anything. So I‚Äôll be thinking about that now.
@Tell_Michelle_ Taking care of business. Working overtime as usual. 	BTO. Workout. üéº
@charliekirk11 Just read about it here for the first time. That‚Äôs really friggin horrible.
@Maxwell_House I think I‚Äôm ineligible for your contest. Everything I do has a dangerous aspect to it. Rest assured, no other person on this planet, will be doing the work I have to do.
@Maxwell_House Yes. I‚Äôm doing the work on Labor Day.
I would love to drive the guy there myself. It‚Äôs a shame, I‚Äôm actually poor, and don‚Äôt own a vehicle.
@jjauthor Yes, that seems to be correct. I think there are many benefits an organized government can create and provide. There are also boundaries that must be recognized and honored.
@jjauthor Yupper. They all seem to have the same motivation, under a different name. Maybe a technique devised to appeal to a broader voter spectrum. 	I‚Äôm not enticed.
Is anyone in the financial position to assist this man? If so, try and contact him, get the wheels in motion. 	Thank you. https://t.co/Qja7lXPC49
@LauraLoomer Yeah I read that üòÄ 	That‚Äôs a step in the right direction , huh? 	There‚Äôs a lot of people in my twitter feed happy about it.
@LauraLoomer This is the first I‚Äôve heard mention of it. But it was secret, so I wasn‚Äôt supposed to know. 	What do you think it was about? 	What if it was a stand down meeting. That happens sometimes.
@jjauthor Whatever super secret pieces of info there are may or may not change some people‚Äôs attitude, but the majority of people have levied their opinion on the matter. 	The other majority of people haven‚Äôt been paying attention, or don‚Äôt care either way. 	Know what I mean?
@jjauthor So I thought about this. She was at the hearing. Many of you watched it and saw her comments. 	But we don‚Äôt know a lot of things about it. Just the same she doesn‚Äôt know how many of you feel and know about it either. So she goes on with her live, head in the clouds.
@kwilli1046 @LazyMeatball If those Muslims are Americans, I don‚Äôt see why they wouldn‚Äôt just join in on the memorial and it‚Äôs activity.	By thinking it‚Äôs bias, I‚Äôm forced to think they are bias.
@ArsiniegaAlfred This is interesting. She sings at the funeral of an artist that wrote and performed RESPECT. 	Yet she entirely shows disrespect to the flag, it‚Äôs country, and all of its people. Celebrated by former President.
@80sjams I am not against it.
@ArsiniegaAlfred I hope she immediately wipes that smirk off her face. With the flag that isn‚Äôt hers mind you. 	Obviously so that her face will then be smeared with her own ass mess.
@LauraLoomer Ha yeah after reading your previous post, I was like ‚Äúnaaah she cares about stuff big time.‚Äù 	I know what you mean though.
@LauraLoomer I don‚Äôt know. Shower and unpack a nice dress shirt at least.
I live like 4000 miles from the nearest In/Out Burger. Am I really expected to boycott something like that? I can‚Äôt even offer my patronage. 	Looks like a really good burger though. 	I‚Äôm just going to keep sitting in my chair.
Clue is on. Passing out. 		Please be blessed. 	Let us return.
@Jimmythevet Recently, I‚Äôve watched ‚ÄúThe Omega Man‚Äù multiple times. It offers a quality of visual storytelling unequaled even with the most vibrant effects. 	Charting Heston is an amazing actor. I have a feeling he helped in making those original films so great as well.
@Fuctupmind @irishdriven I sure as shit don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs a good idea.
Research what happened to that one girl, when an undocumented worker got ahold of a document. Then think about it for a week. Think about the actual consequences of easy access to such a prestigious document.
No I‚Äôm super duper pissed off, but it‚Äôs not intended to be reflected in the question. I‚Äôm just trying to have a conversation about this really important topic you‚Äôve created.
@CynthiaNixon A drivers license is a document. Why would it be within reason to give that document to an undocumented worker?
@ollieisyms Jack knows how to roll.
@Jimmythevet Dr. Zayus!
She‚Äôs got the boogie fever. She likes to boogie down. 		I don‚Äôt know the band name. Reply if you know.
I don‚Äôt want to use your tax money to do it either. How stupid do you really think I am? If you say, ‚Äúnot stupid at all‚Äù 	Then you are correct! 	Any other answer will not be accepted!
@RaminNasibov It looks real. The artist is amazing.
@ollieisyms Nice shirt.
Remaining calm. Being cool.
@area51F @RealJamesWoods She‚Äôs got those jive moves down pat. It‚Äôs all good.
Oh. More sex trafficking. How do people that messed up even survive? What reason could exist that there is even a region of the brain that allows them to coincide with the rest of society for so long? 	There is no answer.
Put a lump of coal in my hand. I will make you diamonds. There is so much whatever you call it. Inner tension. Yes. 	Spontaneous combustion is on its way. Jeez.
There‚Äôs always that one person that messes up EVERYTHING. No matter how hard I actually try in life. It is destined to be messed up by that one person. It is so aggravating.
It‚Äôs not for kids though. I‚Äôm not ok with the kids doing it. Jeez.
I was really feeling creative too. See? There‚Äôs always something out there. Jeez.
Ah jeez. Ya know. There‚Äôs just some things you don‚Äôt do. Letting..... allowing? Almost forcing? Children to smoke?? 	Video tape it too. Let the whole world know! 	Ah nuts. https://t.co/JaCeOnnBJE
Are you kidding me???	Critics are raving! 	This guys a madhouse! 		And I didn‚Äôt even start. Later!
The toll I take with me is knowing, I am damned to begin with. I can wear it on my head as a reminder. 	It won‚Äôt be my own actions I pity. Only those that cause me to seek vengeance, will I look down upon them, with anger so unbridled, not even I will be able to control it.
What part of my actions am I to blame? Will it be my involvement or the lack of? Can I keep myself just close enough to maintain the safety I intend to offer? 	Even in the comics, even with all the power of imagination at work, we find ourselves, that one moment too late.
I seems no matter how much I know, how much I prepare for, no matter how careful I can be, there‚Äôs always going to be someone, something, that went over my head, just to do harm. 	Even if for no reason at all. It happens, and I‚Äôll be left guilt stricken for the rest of my life.
I agree with what she said. Basically all hours of the day and night, I think about horrible things that might be happening to the people I care about. What you would call friends and family. 	Even people I will never know personally, I wish them well.
I‚Äôm not alone with that notion either.
Maybe we can clash swords and shed some blood. Sure. If the price is right. 	Can those so easily offended by words, afford what is at stake? 	Talk is cheap. Mountains less than a hospital bill or attorney fee. 	Save yourself.
I could look to wise men or scripture for advice on the matter. 	The reality of it is this. I just don‚Äôt have the time, to be offended. 	I have more responsibility than I can handle, and an hourglass that doesn‚Äôt just stop at my convenience.
That‚Äôs how I feel, but maybe I‚Äôm just different. I understand how there are people that do get offended by words alone. 	It‚Äôs rarely discussed openly with me, by those that are offended. 	I‚Äôve had conversation before, with language not suitable for all ages. 	We still get along.
You‚Äôll have to make a decision at the grocery store between 17% fecal content, or .014% sometimes. 	Of course many cereals are full of sugar anyway. Like a third of its total. 	There‚Äôs so much I don‚Äôt like or agree with the recent government body, I can‚Äôt even begin to explain.

@KamVTV I just want legal untainted marijuana. Really good stuff, with no other drugs laced into it. 	That is all.
@LauraLoomer @realDonaldTrump There is truth in that statement.
@ollieisyms @jennybennyb00 And and and you get to sing along to Mickey Mouse club. It‚Äôs fun for the whole family.
@w_terrence @BFISA Nah, it‚Äôs not words that offend me. It‚Äôs more so, the actions of some people. Criminal actions, like killing and thievery. Civil rights violations. That offends me. 	I just don‚Äôt think what everyone is saying, is racist. At all. 	I can give examples, I just can‚Äôt say it here.
@RealJamesWoods @NurseOnThis Dude. I work at a unicorn ranch! 	It‚Äôs fascinating, our taste in mythical creatures really. Fascinating. 	Well, catch ya later.
@LauraLoomer A wiser man than myself can say monkey in up to 26 different languages. It‚Äôs pretty impressive.
Look at how picky-choosey I have to be just to make a conductive statement free of racial persecution.
Racism, is when you disassociate, degrade, or discriminate, based on a persons race, or ethnicity. 	It has nothing to do with word association. 	Whomever conceived todays anti-mammal concept is a pathological psychopath. 	I‚Äôm betting a dollar bill it was a news outlet.
@LauraLoomer It‚Äôs not racism if we like these things.
@ShepardAmbellas @YouTube Without clicking your link..... I Hypothesize that an airborne craft of some kind, with onboard or man operated weaponry, was being utilized for causing casualties.
Someone made a valid point of discussion. 	The judges, or its immediate family may come to be threatened. 	Oh. Sooooo you want plan b? 	Learn from others mistakes. Avoid plan b.
@LauraLoomer Still not racism.
Yeah but the damage would already be done. That‚Äôs the problem. If anyone has any prior knowledge, why not act on it??? At least go check it out! Put up a checkpoint, a camera, something, for the peace of mind. 	It‚Äôs that damn process, I care not for. If you have a hunch, use it!
@KristySwansonXO That person sucks. Look at how much time it wasted?
Jealousy, is the most worthless of human emotions. 	I know it‚Äôs caused us to lose great people. Those of great talent, and those we cared about regardless. 	I‚Äôve seen it‚Äôs head turn and look back at me with it‚Äôs grin, and eyes pulled dim. Oh I‚Äôve seen it. 	I know what it can do.
@LauraLoomer It‚Äôs because I‚Äôm so Caucasian isn‚Äôt it? I know I‚Äôm sooooo different than everyone else. I go out in public, and I can feel the loathing. Some people are polite. Other people are ignorant. There‚Äôs nothing I can do about that. 	I feel like I don‚Äôt belong where I am, but I‚Äôm bound.
@LauraLoomer I‚Äôm safe to an extent, but I cant keep everyone else I care about as safe as I am. I have trust issues. A heightened sense of paranoia as well. Very low pay. No time travel yet.
@KristySwansonXO Still not racism.
@LauraLoomer I like your attitude.
That‚Äôs actually quite a bit to think about. 	They have prior knowledge, but don‚Äôt do anything about it.... those Dems are all quiet about it too.... - because they get disinformation to rely on and don‚Äôt question the dis-intel..... 	and the judges are probably getting kickback. O
@LauraLoomer Ok, I see what you mean. How can you prove it? 	What kind of training is even necessary? 	If that was what they are going to do, they would just do it. Look at the risk involved. The police, federal marshals, ATF agents, etc, all getting involved. Their plan wouldn‚Äôt stem far.
@Dismay00 @bringbackfear @possessed_radio @MrHorror @crashpalace @isaacrthorne @dvdinfatuation @NYounker @JustEm_78 @12nighthorror @BlutengelDaemon Don‚Äôt forget to fill it with gas too. Only use two-stroke small engine lubricant. Otherwise you may bog out mid-kill. 	That would be embarrassing, to the max.
Well, I just found out what a twitter troll looks like. 	Whatever force of evil is able to motivate this beast to actually leave the house on Halloween, is definitely something I am now terrified of.
@Ummmmichelle @KristySwansonXO Jeez... trick or treat is right. I‚Äôll just leave the bag of candy with a sign that says ‚Äúplease take one‚Äù 	And underline the ‚Äúone‚Äù for emphasis.
@Dismay00 @possessed_radio @MikeysDead @SlasherRadio Also, Warwick Davis, was Willow Offgood. That little person is a hero to me. I‚Äôd smoke weed with him at the drop of a gold coin.
@Dismay00 @possessed_radio @MikeysDead @SlasherRadio A friend with weed... is a friend indeed. 		Before he kills you with Lep magic, and your legs turn into spaghetti.
@Dismay00 @possessed_radio @MikeysDead @SlasherRadio Leprechaun is a good guy. He smokes bongs.
@HungryTrucker I‚Äôm pretty sure the henchmen can see through the disguise. She‚Äôs obviously just tan. This is messed up.
@HungryTrucker Um Mayday? 	Diamonds Are Forever? 		Or she‚Äôs going to act like she‚Äôs black? Is there a point to that? Oohhhh k.
The sky is actually just a stratospheric threshold. We can go beyond that too. 		Isn‚Äôt that great???!!!
It doesn‚Äôt stop there. They sell organism piss, and sugar crack drinks, and all sorts of garbage. 	Everything you need is taken care of. The sky is the limit!
Mathematics - 	Population - 326,000,000 approx. 	2 - liter - $2.79	Tax rate - 8-10 % 	Equals = You are all good! 		‚úåÔ∏èüá∫üá∏ü¶á
Heeere toooo heeeeelp........brraaaaains.....	gluuuuaaaagrrrrhh!!
The fact remains. That money is there. It‚Äôs already accounted for, and that‚Äôs only the tax on the soda! 	There must be hundreds of trillions of dollars of revenue, that can be appointed to what matters most. Maybe it‚Äôs your health? Maybe it‚Äôs a pothole. A school book. Name it.
You don‚Äôt even need to drink the soda! 	Maybe it rots your teeth, or you have diabetes concerns!	The fact remains, that transaction occurs, roughly 18 billion times annually.	We can fact check that with ease. I literally made up that number. But you must see the point.
Roughly 28 cents ($0.28) a year, per citizen, through tax revenue, pays the salary of the house and senate. That‚Äôs really all it is. 	If every person in the country, buys 1 - 2 liter bottle of soda. That expense has been covered via a standard sales tax. That‚Äôs pretty amazing.
@KristySwansonXO The scariest costume i just thought of. 	The Federal Employee. Looks like a zombie with a suit coat. Instead of saying ‚Äúbraaaaaiins‚Äù 	It says, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm here to heeelllp yooou...... I‚Äôm heeeeere to heeeeelp‚Äù 	And it just follows you and tries to steal your wallet or purse. 	‚ÄúHeeelp u‚Äù
@KristySwansonXO You‚Äôve caught my attention. What does a twitter troll look like?
I don‚Äôt mean mentally challenged either. Even though the resources were present, the personnel is on the clock, it didn‚Äôt get done, and now we are the assholes apparently. She looks stupid with the big sunglasses, they waste millions of dollars on bullshit, I can‚Äôt stand it.
@intellihubnews @ShepardAmbellas Dude. I would have checked all the mail. I‚Äôd even make sure all the solder joints on the computers were done right. That whole situation is retarded.
@intellihubnews I wonder what they do with all the fish? 	I figure that would be important to know, that if it‚Äôs actually Toxic, it doesn‚Äôt go to anyone to be eaten. Right? 	That‚Äôs messed up though.
@damnitbatman A blowtorch and/or a little gasoline can turn anyone into a professional chef, instantly.
It‚Äôs not cliche enough. 		‚ÄúThe Conners‚Äù should involve time travel to revive Roseanne. 	They should have Mulder and Scully come in looking for the smoking guy, that was finally abducted by ET‚Äôs. 	Roseanne comes back, but she has amnesia, and Becky has to help her remember.
@mandymendez90 @ZibaLady1 @ABCNetwork @nypost That‚Äôs so cliche.
@ollieisyms They‚Äôve saved the day so many times, they deserve a day. For sure.
@Education4Libs Jokes on them. When I pass by a tv that has ‚Äú8 legs and a guy in a suit‚Äù on, I just continue to pass by. 	No time for fake-ness.
@LauraLoomer Your quality of journalism is still great. 	That‚Äôs not why I haven‚Äôt much to say.
@ollieisyms Go shorty. It‚Äôs your birthday. Go shorty. It‚Äôs your birthday. We gonna sip Bacardi, like it‚Äôs your birthday. And you know, we don‚Äôt give a f@$%, it‚Äôs not your birthday. 		You mighty morphin power rangers.....üéº
@b1bari @DrKathieMathis @Education4Libs Well, maybe I was curious, so I scrolled through her twitter. After a few hundred or so, I don‚Äôt see the words, Trump, white, or liberal, at all. 	Maybe I‚Äôll look more later.
@ollieisyms Croc-ception
@ollieisyms Fiberglass is gross.
@ollieisyms Precisely, the absence of taste. 	The enzymes produced by your tongue and digestion, create a taste sensation. I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs comparable to powdered calcium. 	Experiment with a salt free cracker. Place it in your mouth but don‚Äôt chew. Moments later, you create the taste.
@ollieisyms Well.... dry wall, like gypsum board.... Id day it tastes like chalk. Very calcium taste.
@ollieisyms I‚Äôve worked with floor tile that looked so good, yes I would want to eat it. And vanilla bacon flavor??? 	Munch munch.....
@WeWontBend1 @MareForAmerica I was recently informed of a bacon-flavor Windex. 		Manufacturers of flat screen TVs recommend against glass cleaner, but ..... bacon.
@intellihubnews Well you really shouldn‚Äôt play with a fellas emotions like that. Men have feelings too.
@intellihubnews Oh. She honeypotted the guy. Oh I see.
@ollieisyms Mmmm. That‚Äôs one tasty floor you have there. 	Luckily I have these waffles and sausages, and oops! Dropped it again! Silly me.
@ollieisyms Unless you actually like to eat on the floor. üò¨
@bud_cann @Julia5180 Yeah...... what was he even shushing about ? That looks so creepy.
@LeBandzJames1 @TheCalPatriot I think they were all huge problems.
@podobensky @awaken_to_maga Well that could get confusing if someone just wants the damn pizza.
@LauraLoomer Just saw it on the tv.
@RealJack @tgatorguy I killed 0 things this week. I also received $0 for a paycheck. Trust me, I‚Äôm not happy about it one bit. 	These statistics are infuriating.
@MoosePatriot1 @Germantownrunne That‚Äôs a good question. 		John Dillinger, is one that comes to mind. As his story goes, he actually shot and killed many police officers, and robbed banks while evading arrest. 	After the ‚Äò50s and since the FBI and CIA handle most affairs	we probably just don‚Äôt see that tag much.
@SheriffTrahan That one joist hanger bothers me. This isn‚Äôt the first time I‚Äôve seen a floating floor joist like that. It‚Äôs like it‚Äôs holding up a sign. Taunting me. 	Any sag or creek in the floor?
It‚Äôs real life folks. It‚Äôs priceless. I hope yours is going well.
@area51F @drdepena Or I could be like.... no these are mine. I like to try all the flavors. 		And just stare. Until security walks away.
@area51F @drdepena I totally would‚Äôve told security, look, I just finished a bathroom remodel and it‚Äôs a bloody mess. My wife and 4 daughters are all on the same schedule, now I need to get these tampons home pronto! 	That‚Äôs such a wacky scenario. I can‚Äôt imagine being that guard. That‚Äôs crazy.
@MavisJ1 @LazyMeatball She said feckless, but you actually put forth the effort. 	I don‚Äôt think they know what that word means.... they just think it‚Äôs supposed to be more insulting for some reason. Meh. 		You did the right thing. ‚úåÔ∏è
@Education4Libs @joannarn4kids Um..... there‚Äôs a lot of really cool things in there. Im part way through revelations, and I would pretty much do whatever it takes for that stuff not to happen. I have some theories about that ending. I‚Äôd be majorly pissed as well. Unfortunately some things can never change.
@Trenton_Hoshiko Oh shit. I know how that feels. 		Gooooaall!!
@area51F Wow that‚Äôs too funny. 		Of course when that cream is needed, it‚Äôs needed bad. I‚Äôve literally bought a girlfriend tampons. All the necessary information was relayed to me to make the right purchase. I know my way around the store, too. Mission-success that day, I can assure you.
@area51F I actually never met a fan of the show. But if you get a car for being in the audience, that‚Äôs why they are there. 	I believe most of their revenue is from advertising costs, for products I‚Äôll never purchase or need an ad for.
@area51F That‚Äôs correct.
@area51F At some point in time, she started giving the audience cars. Many stay at home moms really liked the emotional aspect of her interviews. 	I never watched her show for over 4 seconds of my life though. I remain unaffected.
@LauraLoomer That‚Äôs one of the best parts.
@getnbusykings @KC_LasVegas @RealWayneRoot Very badass of you too.
@getnbusykings @KC_LasVegas @RealWayneRoot Page 112 twelve will answer that question. 	It describes her relationship with Paddock, and her involvement with the ammunition around that point in time.
@ECoastYellaHair Hold on. Yes I read what you said and was agreeing with you. 	What I was saying was in reference to things his attorney is saying to make it seem like it‚Äôs ok about what he did. That is all.
@ECoastYellaHair @sa6274 If that‚Äôs what is claimed, it doesn‚Äôt make the crime ok. 		What does everyone think about that baby he has apparently? The term ‚Äúanchor baby‚Äù was mentioned. Because of that he shouldn‚Äôt have had a problem maybe. Instead he did something much worse.
@Rockprincess818 @teokee If those kids are old enough to be in school, I‚Äôm pretty sure they aren‚Äôt just ‚Äúgender fluid‚Äù anymore. 	This occurs naturally after conception.
@KC_LasVegas @RealWayneRoot She actually said ‚Äúof course my fingerprints might be on the bullets, I helped load the things‚Äù	Soooo, that makes her a definite accessory to any crime that may have taken place.
@KC_LasVegas @RealWayneRoot A testimony of hers I once read claimed that she was assisting the loading of magazines on a prior date. 	One reason I think she didnt work for the fbi, otherwise she would have known that could cause some flak. 	Or she could have been promised immunity at some point.
Murder is illegal! Kidnapping and murder is illegal! Don‚Äôt ever forget that.
All it would take is a confession of a legitimate proposition. That doesn‚Äôt look likely at this time. 	The employment connection may just be coincidence, and this was a crime of passion. 	It‚Äôs still illegal as can be.
It‚Äôs not uncommon. Often that type of thing is referred to as ‚ÄúHostile Corporate Takeover‚Äù. 	Many methods have been used in the past. 	It can happen between businesses right across the street from each other. There‚Äôs usually a price battle, an effort for sales in the market. Yup.
Apparently, the brother of the owner had certain political affiliation. This could actually mean something. That a conviction put on, an employee, would make them appear a certain way. If that were so.
@ThereseOSulliv2 @barmore27 @awaken_to_maga For some reason I saw it go from Colorado to Iowa. 	Thank you for responding.
@barmore27 @awaken_to_maga Can anyone here clarify what State the suspect worked in? 	The one at the dairy farm?
If a person physically enters another country without permission, and causes harm to another person or property, what would you call that? 		You would define that as many things. Including, international terrorist. Remember this.
@LauraLoomer Don‚Äôt let the crazy people bring you down. You‚Äôre better than they are. One day, sooner than later, they can realize how great it is to be on the right path.
@LauraLoomer Sometimes I feel the same way. 	Just like in that Seal song, that I think he as well as Mushroomhead covered, 	we‚Äôre never gonna survive, unless we get a little crazy.
@SarahPalinUSA @DartLucy I really see what he‚Äôs trying to say there. 	The people just don‚Äôt want that sort of thing. The automobile is the current means of travel, and it really can‚Äôt be relieved of use. 	Doesn‚Äôt London have the best monitoring equipment? Cameras everywhere and good police force?
@1776Stonewall @Alisand3 No. She would have finished her jog. Gone back to her dogsitting, and shared an evening with her boyfriend 	and/or maybe other welcomed company. Statistically.
@1776Stonewall @RecTherapistVA Ha . You could even see a meteorite trail and maybe avoid it. It doesn‚Äôt follow you, grab you, put you in the trunk of a car and then so on.
@1776Stonewall @LondonMichaels Sure, but we would be examining the train, it‚Äôs conductor and any blood alcohol content and drug use. 	The train wouldn‚Äôt intend on causing an accident, and killing someone.
Obviously, I want the guy to talk. I want to know his dental records, and shoe size. Everything.
I agree with your assumption. He must have associates that plan on committing further criminal action. 	Birds of a feather stick together, but a feather of a bird can make this canary sing. 	I wish I could see his dress rehearsal. 	So much laughter. So much laughter. So much....
So he has demands. This makes me think that he was working in concerto with someone or something else. He‚Äôs almost alluding that something will happen otherwise. https://t.co/unIkGqtYf5
@vixentrots @RealitySmash You can probably even make a brush from those hairs. Then not a single thing goes to waste. That‚Äôs really great how you practice. Really.
I really hope that when I speak, you can detect the hint of sarcasm in my tone. Although I‚Äôm always more serious than necessary, I need to use that little bit of humor, as to not be all the way inhuman. 	Aren‚Äôt we all just human anyway? 	Be cool.
@realDonaldTrump @Alisand3 They don‚Äôt even know how to hunt witches. They‚Äôre a bunch of amateurs. 	Trust me. I‚Äôve dealt with witches from time to time. They sure as hell don‚Äôt hang out at plate dinners, and fundraiser events. 	Amateurs....
@hrenee80 I agree. When forensic evidence points in another direction, that‚Äôs one thing, but to actually depend him like he was ‚Äújust having a bad day‚Äù is pretty unacceptable. 	It happened in London in the past few months. 	I‚Äôd say we‚Äôre all experiencing some bad days lately.
@IngrahamAngle Canvas carry all is the way to go. Reusable, machine washable, very sturdy. If used with care, your groceries will never fall through. 	Also available in a variety of colors and custom prints to suit your needs. 	One carry all can safely accommodate 3 - 750ml wine bottles. Enjoy!
@ICEgov @Alisand3 I wonder if those two are even alive.
@lisaedwards63 @realDonaldTrump And I mean a GOOD deal. Not just a quick throw to turn the tide. The long run, is what we favor.
@lisaedwards63 @realDonaldTrump He, being from a business type background, and for the love of a good business deal maybe, I can surely appreciate, that he‚Äôs at the head of the table right now.
@lisaedwards63 @realDonaldTrump Well that‚Äôs something I can really appreciate. And I do. 	I may not understand everything about everything, but I do love my country still. I wouldn‚Äôt want to see it get all messed up. 	Ill conceived trade agreements, with dollar signs as the bargaining piece can do just that.
@LauraLoomer A buddy of mine made a new strain of maple tree. That‚Äôs a cool thing you could journalize one day. 	Its not all bad news out there. But I know what you mean. We‚Äôre smack in the middle of a mine field of filth and crime everywhere. 	I‚Äôm glad someone like you is on the job.
@freedom_moates @joannarn4kids We would have to know, at what point in time, did the suspect begin following the victim, and from what location. Was there prior knowledge, that she would be dog sitting? These things may be answered through computer system analysis.
@freedom_moates @joannarn4kids If there are phone records that can be obtained, there may be evidence of a communication to commit the crime. Anyone that may have provided stolen ID. The vehicle for transportation, to seek a victim. Any funding for travel in said vehicle. I would consider them accessory.
@freedom_moates @joannarn4kids That would be considered aiding and abetting. Murder is still a felony right? These are serious charges.
@realDonaldTrump @lisaedwards63 It isn‚Äôt wrong that you won the election.
@realTylerZed @truog398174 So it‚Äôs really like $50 from everyone nationwide...... the wall is going to benefit everyone. Not just Trump supporters.
@Alyssa_Milano Seriously, I‚Äôm under the impression, based on recent news headlines, and hordes of communication effort, that human trafficking is huge. Especially in California. 	Are you aware of this? Is there truth to the matter? Would anyone like to contest that claim?
@w_terrence @AlexB01054904 The report says he lived in Colorado for almost 7 years. Why would a rough life in Mexico, absolve him of murder? 	We all have rough lives from time to time. 	Why would that make it acceptable to abduct the girl and kill her?
@Alyssa_Milano When you were young, were you safe? 	I‚Äôve read the news, I‚Äôve seen the numbers. We aren‚Äôt that safe anymore. 	Unless it‚Äôs all a big lie. Whatcha think?
@Alyssa_Milano Look at that photo of her. She‚Äôs happy, she‚Äôs smiling, she‚Äôs looking great, and that‚Äôs great! 		There‚Äôs just so many issues that need to be addressed, immediately. There‚Äôs too much criminal activity, not enough good things going on. 	Think about the kids.
@Alyssa_Milano No. There‚Äôs too many people dying and people being abducted, because of the policies she supports. 	That doesn‚Äôt mean she‚Äôs probably a great lady, but her policies cause the security of people everywhere to be compromised. 	Maybe she‚Äôs also been brainwashed? IDK.
@SmackYeti @TsrTrump There‚Äôs a list of words I want to say off the top of my head to that Senator. Words so vulgar it will cause an avalanche in Colorado if I was standing in Maine. 	For now, everything she‚Äôs saying about this girl that was murdered is wrong, and I‚Äôm going to remember this.
@beaglebabe48 @LazyMeatball But what about the Freedom of Information Act and The Patriot Act? 	I was asked to prove who I was by my bank one time. I was alive and lived in the area longer than and before they even existed! 	But I understand why they needed to do that. Now they know who I am. All good.
This answers a few of my questions. Stolen ID. It‚Äôs infuriating really. I am in no way ok with this. https://t.co/bWyBK5u3DA
@USArmy @FOX2News I did it one time. I was watching the house and a rainstorm or a gust of wind knocked over the pole, breaking it in two. The duct tape mended the pole, and I raised that flag back in place on high. 	The family and neighbors can verify. 	‚úåÔ∏èüá∫üá∏ü¶á
A million dollars isn‚Äôt enough.
I wish she just made it home safe. Why did it have to be like this???	What about the other 40 or so missing people from that one area? And all the other people?
Not just a conspiracy theory, but criminal theory being run through, step by step.
Unfortunately that is information that will never be divulged to me, or the rest of the public. 	At least not yet. Though I‚Äôd love to look at the case. I already don‚Äôt believe he‚Äôs the only one involved. He probably won‚Äôt talk. Maybe he‚Äôs just going along with the routine.
I really must know, did this guy have a fake ID? No ID? 	How does an illegal alien immigrant go about getting a car to drive and money to fund an expedition across that big of a distance? 	How?
Oh yeah there‚Äôs so much more to this.
Then coincidentally, do what you may already know he did. 	This guy had the money to do this? I really want to know, his employment history, all known family, accomplices. 	His vehicle must have been stolen. How did he get plates and insurance? Drivers license?
So, apparently, am undocumented immigrant, or whatever you want to call it, can find his way a thousand miles across a country border, live somewhere for up to 5 years, acquire a vehicle, with no proof of citizenship mind you, then one day drive about 500 miles across two states
@SassySouthern10 @LazyMeatball @SoulWarrior1994 I‚Äôve stayed up late many nights worrying about this. Its one of the most horrible things I ever think about.
I just read someone threatened the President. Again. 	Ggrrrrr.
@MilitaryEarth @GatesRobin That walk way has been seal-coated.... the greyish tint and the absence of the brushed edge gives it away. 	Dude that dog looks awesome! Hell yeah, good job!
@politicalHEDGE Well that‚Äôs really great. I hope this works for the better and I can chill the hell out soon.
@autumnbragwell @zaku1982 Only if it‚Äôs done right. I put care into making every pizza I ever put in the oven. 	That slice looks shoddy. I blame the 9/11 WTC attack of course. 	And they expect you to be satisfied??? Pssshh! 	Nope. Not today.
@Comey There are people that will lie straight to your face. By the time you start asking questions, everyone you need answers from have probably, even been paid to lie to you. 	How do you get around that? How do you find the truth in a pile of lies? 	It‚Äôs true, there are ways.
@Education4Libs @Pickles0201 Whoever is doing the shooting is hurting people, hurting the kids. 	Commerce is being affected, people can‚Äôt go to their jobs safely. Kids can‚Äôt go to school. 	I‚Äôm so pissed about this and i really want to do something about it.
@CramerDon @Education4Libs No, these are forensic details that, in time will lead to arrests. 	This is the thing, someone out there is committing a crime like that, and that shouldn‚Äôt be affecting other people as well. 	Each person has their own rights and should not be infringed, due to others wrongdoing.
@itstaylor0826 @Education4Libs This can be misleading, but shotguns are available with rifled barrels. 	I know what you mean though. Things are often just said, without proper terminology, and causes so much confusion.
@jheltz27 @Education4Libs @stephenhotard It‚Äôs harder to hear in open land. So if you are in the city, you should definitely hear something. At least an echo.
@jheltz27 @Education4Libs @stephenhotard Excellent. Have you even heard gunfire? It‚Äôs unmistakable and you can notice it for miles sometimes. 	I‚Äôm in farm territory. I can hear some people shooting in the distance sometimes. No one gets hurt either.
@EliasonRich @Education4Libs No, you said the facts. I don‚Äôt think you are being racist. 	But you bring up a good point. Now these children are fatherless, with the mother to fend for herself?? And that‚Äôs horrible. 	And what is causing these men to behave this way? 	Can it be how they were raised? Idk!
@johnson_1isaac @Education4Libs And I‚Äôm just so reminded of that guy in Cali. Holding up the ‚Äúghost gun‚Äù, saying things like 30 caliber clips or whatever he said. And it drove us all crazy, how he went up there saying that. 	It‚Äôs so depressing sometimes. I appreciate your sense of humor. Later.
@johnson_1isaac @Education4Libs I find your comment to be so funny, I don‚Äôt even know what to do. 	I‚Äôve thought about it. It seems this is the kind of logic we‚Äôre dealing with lately. This is actually what the people think about the guns, that just don‚Äôt know about them. At the same time don‚Äôt want to know.
@Education4Libs @Pickles0201 If it‚Äôs a 9mm, it‚Äôs one of the more common caliber rounds. 	But what are you trying to say here? I‚Äôm really interested in what you have to say.
@SassySculptor @LazyMeatball A guy like that sticks out like a sore dick. 		Arm sleeve tattoo? I seeeeee yoouu.....
Words were said to me, and I couldn‚Äôt even comprehend what was said at the time. 	One day soon I‚Äôm going to have to continue the conversation, with a little rewind in there. 	Otherwise, we move to plan B. 	You don‚Äôt want plan B.
@Thomas1774Paine @Trumplican4ever Had time to go around shooting at people. Friggin bullshit.
@Thomas1774Paine @Trumplican4ever It‚Äôs friggin Monday. 46 people too many. I really want to look at those files, and connect dots. There has GOT to be a way to shut that shit down. 	I want to know, who the hell had time to go out and shoot at people. I barely had time to eat the necessary calorie intake. And they
@area51F Ok I see what you mean. Please don‚Äôt let that get in the way of the scenery. 	I really haven‚Äôt been outside of a 60-120 mile radius. But I‚Äôm sure there‚Äôs something really cool out there.
@area51F There is some amazing architecture in Chicago. I haven‚Äôt been there in a long time, but when the Sky line is lit up at night, it‚Äôs a Kodak moment. 		I‚Äôm in the country area of Illinois.
@area51F Illinois and all of the Midwest has some of the best filming locations. 		Did you know that most of Escape From New York was actually filmed in Illinois?
@area51F I just found out, there was a cyborg shark. They also traveled through time. 		They have NOT gone to Mars yet. 		And they thought they were done.... lol, nope. not today.
This offers many levels of intrigue. 		You may wonder, how did these sharks even get on Mars? 		I have no idea! 		But I want to find out!! 		#Sharknado6 7?
@TaraReid It already got a like! It‚Äôs golden. It‚Äôs fabulous!
@TaraReid Everyone loves it! We have great ideas for part 7 if you peruse some of my latest Tweets. 		#Sharknado6
@area51F I wouldn‚Äôt doubt for one second, that Martian Monkeys grow weed underground. Only sexy Russian Cosmonauts know how to drill things. It‚Äôs on!		#Sharknado6
We‚Äôre digging deep here folks. 		Picture this, if you will. 		A colonial research team is drilling into a frozen waterbed on Mars. A burst of solar radiation melts the ice, while solar winds whirl up a new Sharknado. 		Sharknado On Mars. 		Do you like it? 		#Sharknado6 7?
@area51F A team of researchers trying to colonize Mars drill into a frozen waterbed during a solar-wind storm? Unleashing a Sharknado? Only to be aided by a subterranean habitat of Martian Monkeys? You got it!
@area51F This is golden.
@area51F Ten feet is waaaaaay too close to Mecha-Sharknado. Only that one cave Bill Gates owns, is probably the only safe place. Underground. Nowhere near the beach. 	Oh no! Mecha-Sharknado learned how to bore through the Earth! We‚Äôre doomed! 	Then Godzilla, rises from the sea, to save us
@area51F Sharknado vs Godzilla. It would be fabulous!
@area51F If they didn‚Äôt make Mecha-sharknado yet..... dibs.
@RdNkAngel1989 You‚Äôre traveling through a dimension of space and time....
@RdNkAngel1989 I never got to watch much Star Trek, but I‚Äôm very familiar with The Twilight Zone opener. Ladies and Gentlemen, what you are about to see....		and it gets crazy every time!
@area51F It really makes no sense. To boycott a product, is simply to not purchase that specific product line. It‚Äôs ok, they will figure this out soon. Maybe they just watched a weird tv show or something.
@area51F There has to be an immigration and customs enforcement agency. Otherwise any person can commit a felony level crime, while being of foreign origin, while also being sought by that country of origin for possible previous criminal offenses. ... and all sorts of problems may occur.
@area51F It actually affects a person like me, in that, there is no room for advancement in my current career. 	If the minimum wage goes up, that means any goods and services available will have to rise in price to adjust. Everything will be then less affordable to people like me.
@area51F If her policies were the exact opposite of what she‚Äôs currently pushing, I wouldn‚Äôt have much of a problem with her. 	I do like S‚Äômores though.
@pwrmkr33 Wow Texas is huge.
@FireUpMAGAKAG She assaulted him?? Riiight......
@thenationsrage @julylady2010 I‚Äôm wondering if there‚Äôs any Pro-Trump Satanists out there? I mean why not? Dude knows how to business.
@Anon_decoder My MySpace page has disappeared. Probably because of 9/11 WTC attack. 	Nope not forgetting. 		Yeah MySpace was legit. I learned how to write JavaScript and hyper coding, AND stay connected with friends and associates, at the same time. Good times.

@sxdoc @dsdr2011 I don‚Äôt want that stuff. It‚Äôs so gross.
Nope. Not today.
@RuthOka Hey thank you for getting back to me on that. I also read more about. It may be specifically Southern Korea, and since then they‚Äôve reportedly taken steps toward alternative food sourcing. If that is true, then that‚Äôs really great.
@LauraLoomer @dsdr2011 Didn‚Äôt a man named Moses free slaves, thousands of years before America was ever discovered, and established as a nation? Is there not history taught in schools anymore? 	Nobody ever read a Bible? 	PBS? Saturday morning cartoons? 	Snufalufagus? Marry friggin Poppins? 	Spit Spot.
@LauraLoomer @dsdr2011 But Jewish people were slaves a long time before slavery was in America. It was also abolished in America. 	Does that mean anything to those that condemn white people, because of slavery? 	I think media related brainwashing is at play here. 	Something isn‚Äôt right.. I can feel it.
I read somewhere, Batman actually met God, and also was God for a few minutes. 		He may just be keeping it all a secret from the rest of the cast of characters. The readers always know more. https://t.co/DF5vDsmt1P
@rektredpill @Maggieb1B @LauraLoomer @jack And make an arrest, and arrange that court hearing. 	Those verified accounts make that easier. 	I‚Äôm pretty sure that‚Äôs part of how it works, but no, threatening harm or death to any other person, is not legal. Any continued threat makes the charges and penalty worsened.
@rektredpill @Maggieb1B @LauraLoomer @jack If someone is publicly stating death threats, this should be grounds for prosecution. The defendant, or recipient of the threat, should be entitled to file a claim, and press those charges. 	It also just takes time to review the threat, contact police within jurisdiction....
@ChrisMo37540912 @Maggieb1B America is so great. 		That Cuomo guy must have some kind of brain dysfunction to think like he does.

People like David Crockett, and Daniel Boon. Metallica. Elvis. Ya know?
@LauraLoomer @CNN @jack @TwitterSupport Well, he‚Äôs either mentally challenged or color blind. Or easily bribed, and color blind. Or  what the hell was ge thinking???	He is white. Ok.

@AnthemRespect @RealTT2020 @realDonaldTrump @BreitbartNews I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm offended or anything. Most men self describe themselves in the same way. Are we talking Bull-dog? Or Chihuahua? 	If it‚Äôs the ladder, we might have some issues to work out.
@G_WWG1WGA @JBaker31826004 All this history with Baphomet, and I‚Äôve only heard about it today. Apparently, The Templars had it pretty rough. 	Catholicism sure killed a lot of people huh? Then I read that priests, are actually molesting children sometimes. Hmmmm. ü§îü§®
@ollieisyms @SharknadoSYFY I don‚Äôt watch cable tv. I am watching The Strain on Blu-ray, which is also a SyFy original. 	But Sharknado is great too.
@G_WWG1WGA @JBaker31826004 If that thing is a god, why don‚Äôt we see it flying around ever? Or show up on TMZ? Or at the grocery store even? 	Would it‚Äôs radiance be viewable without suffering insanity or blindness? 	Does it like chili-dogs? 	Was it in the scouts?
@ollieisyms @SharknadoSYFY Now THIS is voting!
@RyanAFournier @Ocasio2018 If she has a piece of paper at that campaign rally, I‚Äôll be pissed. No pens allowed either.
Definitely a problem https://t.co/gVbktQl0L9
@intellihubnews These developers are on the crack pipe, big time. Smoking the crack.
It‚Äôs 3:30 am, not that time has any meaning, but I‚Äôm actually looking through storage containers for a specific item. Just to make sure I‚Äôm on the right track or not. Damn right I have a lot of books. Reading is fun. 	And knowledge is power! Knowing is also half the battle. Fine‚Äô
One of the worst feelings you can get, is when you think something is stolen. A list of possible culprits goes through your head. The possibility that you just misplaced the item. 	All the dread that comes to mind because of what could have happened. 	Currently missing a blade.
@mixedopinionss The whole project came to an end when miscommunication caused the tower to collapse on itself. Who to blame? The engineers? The workers? The slave masters? Maybe the pharaoh? 	There‚Äôs a moral in there somewhere. Don‚Äôt fly too high or your wings will melt? Sure that too. Yup.
@mixedopinionss God saw a problem with this. He   had deemed the people not worthy of such a triumph. 	Instead of a disaster brought forth by the power of nature, He started a different language. Once the workers of the tower began speaking differently to each other, progress, slowed down.
@mixedopinionss From memory - all the folks were building a tower. It‚Äôs purpose was to extend upward through the sky, to reach the Heavens and basically the throne of God. 	While everything was going according to schedule and schematic at first....
@mixedopinionss Do you remember the story of the Tower of Babel?
@eternatives That‚Äôs really bad.
@eternatives That K2 stuff is garbage too. 	I recently found out it‚Äôs sprayed with an aerosol narcotic. I‚Äôm really glad I don‚Äôt use the stuff. 	But I feel bad, that anyone has been duped into buying it, under the assumption, that it was like smoking marijuana. I see a huge problem with that.
@TheGreatFeather @area51F Well sometimes you see crazy things happen, and your eyes just get stuck like that. Sometimes medications or lack of medications can do it too. 	You‚Äôd probably agree, those people behave in a certain awkward way though right?
@ASavageNation @Pickles0201 It‚Äôs in the sewers? What, like they flush it down the toilet? Or throw it into a retention reservoir?
@ASavageNation @Pickles0201 I saw the words ‚Äúmarijuana waste‚Äù , and I laughed. No applause just yet.
@ASavageNation @Pickles0201 That‚Äôs dumb. Use it in one of those bio-diesel things, and turn it into electricity. Yes green.
@politicalHEDGE Oh ** Griffin. I misspelled that accidentally. Not on purpose like she is doing.
@politicalHEDGE Ok. I did some research, and the dictionary told me what ‚Äúfeckless‚Äù means. 	I‚Äôve seen people saying it slot lately, but that just does not describe her (FLOTUS). 	I don‚Äôt know if Miss Griffith understands the actual legal process there is.
@SaraCarterDC @JewelsJones1 Like I told someone the other day. A yes-man, or yes-person, to be PC about it, will agree with you right off a cliff.	Obviously, if I disagree with something, there‚Äôs the possibility that something isn‚Äôt right. 	Woot woot.
@JohnTrumpFanKJV @Brandi_Lou_79 It‚Äôs shitty to try and kill any baby. Wether it‚Äôs before or after birth.
@RyanAFournier @Brandi_Lou_79 I have a registered voter card. I probably need to show ID too.
@SarahPalinUSA Radicalized Christian - someone that reads The Bible aloud, or in public. ??
@realDonaldTrump @dsdr2011 Well that‚Äôs horrible. Yesterday something happened in New Mexico, today something happened in London. Is there a connection do you think?
I think all I‚Äôve read about in the past few months is ; murder, rapists, terrorists, pedophilia, Antifa, politics that don‚Äôt make sense, people being dismembered, people burning, more murders and terrorist schemes, and...... today it‚Äôs frozen brains. 	So things are looking up.
@intellihubnews Well at least that‚Äôs something different. Very cool.
@1776Stonewall It‚Äôs people like you that deserve those medals. You said it so perfectly.
I can only hope it‚Äôs my imagination. But if it‚Äôs real, and what I thought, really did happen, then I will open that door. I will cross that line.
I can see it happening. Whether it‚Äôs real or not, I may not yet know. I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôm just getting myself prepared for the worst scenario, before we come face to face. I only know, if it‚Äôs true, someone has been through something horrible. 	I won‚Äôt be clean until we are done.
And please bless this young lady and hers. https://t.co/I8iJhFDhIw
@DLoesch @kathym4321 Someone just mentioned in my feed, they were given ankle monitor things too.

@CraigRSawyer You got that right Mister. 		There‚Äôs millions of badasses out there. United as apple pie, with bacon armor.
@KristySwansonXO @OMAROSA That was a cool movie. All because of a butterfinger?? Lol. Good times.
And Tim Curry. I‚Äôm watching Clue right now. Again. Because I just can‚Äôt watch his crazy antics enough times. 	Bagels. Oh my goodness, the bagels. Yeah I like that bagel crispy from the toaster. 	I get that bagel all buttery and num num num. Later.
Please bless my friends I‚Äôve had, and the ones I‚Äôve yet to discover, and all the hero‚Äôs and movie stars I do truly appreciate, and you, who took the time to read this far. You have a lot to catch up on, don‚Äôt you? 	And please bless Jesus, for the obvious troubles He went through,
I‚Äôm not wearing a hat, but if I was, I‚Äôd be tipping that sucker. My gratitude, in full favor of all the teachers I ever had. All the work they committed to along the years, stuck in that sponge of a brain I was given. 	And please bless my parents and the rest of my family, and...
@DrEtiquette @MareForAmerica This happens time and time again. 	There are people that hold positions, that are appointed, by the elected leadership. They are also elected, in a similar election process. 		Am I right about any of this? I‚Äôm actually exhausted, and haven‚Äôt studied the subject in 20 years.
@DrEtiquette @MareForAmerica No no, there was an actual election that was held. The votes were tallied, from that election, and an Electoral College made a decision, based on those votes as well as their own criteria. Then, the leadership was elected. That‚Äôs what actually happened. 	True story.
@DLoesch @kathym4321 Do you think they should at least be closely monitored until trial? Basically house arrest due to the circumstances.
@PhillyPhlyr @KOB4 **should have been detained.
@PhillyPhlyr @KOB4 ** or because of religious preference. 		If there is are bodily remains found on property, everyone is a suspect. This is supposed to be pretty cut and dry here. 	Also if there is physical evidence of the training, and testimony, it‚Äôs legit a legit close the book case there. ü§®
@PhillyPhlyr @KOB4 So what if? 	I believe this is case specific. 		THESE people are at a hearing because THEY are suspected of doing what they are doing. It has nothing to do with ethnicity or political affiliation. They have been detained till trial. 	Now they have a chance to commit other crimes.
@exhaultGod You are correct. 	I don‚Äôt know what that man could be thinking saying something like he did. It‚Äôs too bizarre. 	It‚Äôs possible he may have sympathizers as well.
@chrisfawkes @AngelFoxToday71 @RealCandaceO @Ocasio2018 This was pretty funny. I chuckled.
@demsrloosers @ELITESTARDUST Honestly, I could have that look on cue, but I drink coffee and work all day. Naturally, I look exhausted.
@demsrloosers @ELITESTARDUST All of these people say ludicrous things also. 	A really sober person could have eyes really open, but these people always look like that. Also they say crazy things. 	They are crazy.
@LaRae_Writes @jsherm268 I think I saw that guy at the Walmart the other day.
@LaRae_Writes @jsherm268 I can see the intelligence level, when a person like that can say something such as he did. 	He lives in America. But Americans should be annihilated. Sooooo, what else should I be thinking besides that guy has issues?
@GodsAmazingLov1 @DeasonJeannie I‚Äôve been there. Not just once or twice either.
@RealJamesWoods It says parody account right on the description. I literally glanced at it! What the hell.
@DailyCaller @PmoKnows @realDonaldTrump Really though. A death threat is  either that, or it‚Äôs a deliberate act of terrorism. I don‚Äôt think temporary insanity is going to apply here. Whoever is orchestrating the protest needs to provide some answers. With haste.
Maybe someone is getting them riled up. I wonder if they do it for money. Is it the politicians? Is it the police? Is it about the country being a ‚Äúpolice state‚Äù? 	I bet it‚Äôs the policies. Those piss me off too. Immensely. 	Need more answers..... need more coffee....
There‚Äôs always times when push the envelope. Threatening the President, is an example of pushing too far. 	Still I have to wonder why they are saying this in the first place? 	And do they not understand the consequences involved?
So, I just read an article about a ‚Äúprogressive protest group‚Äù claiming they want to harm the President. 	As of now, I haven‚Äôt read anything about why. Also I have nothing to do with the people wagering the threat. 	I have no knowledge of communication with any member.
@IngrahamAngle No. If they were an anti-hate group, they would be ‚ÄúThanking-the-police‚Äù and throwing parties. 	Instead of vandalising property and wasting food. 	Those poor little eggs. They were supposed to be somebody‚Äôs meal for breakfast, or baking ingredients. 	Grrrr.
@LauraLoomer @realDonaldTrump It‚Äôs not a phobia. We don‚Äôt negotiate with terrorists.
I‚Äôm eating a sandwich.
I haven‚Äôt seen the ‚Äúmoth man‚Äù a single time so far. I watched this movie probably 4 times now. No moth man. No prophecy. Just a car accident, that was easily avoidable. 	I want seat belts people. Safety first! https://t.co/JTge1eH13s
@RealJamesWoods @dsdr2011 They could make a thing that allows the flight control tower remotely shutdown the planes right? We do have technology like that.
I‚Äôm actually thinking about really horrible things that could‚Äôve happened. I can‚Äôt just walk in the room and run the tests I would need to. Meanwhile, the numbers rise as the days go by. Still, the credit you could have once had begins to fade. 	So, was it worth your effort?
And look at all the money it costs to just follow the leader, and sweep that dirt under the rug. 	The running tab is hundreds of millions of dollars, maybe billions, to actually not do the right thing. 	I‚Äôm not even impressed.
There‚Äôs obviously stuff on the ground. Things in the air. Things have happened. People have lied or made plausible denials. 	Someone even started talking to ghosts or spirits. All I did was eat a cheeseburger, and took a nap. 	There‚Äôs crazier people, not on payroll accounts.
There‚Äôs just some things we will never know. It‚Äôs a secret for a reason, and can never be proven without a confession, and a bunch of evidence. 	I can imagine different scenarios all day long, but there‚Äôs certain things and ways that have to be looked at. Not the obvious clues.
@BlueSea1964 @lisaedwards63 Yeah well, that‚Äôs not being racist.
@nbtrailtech @LasVegasCoverUp @iamjohncullen @LauraLoomer @intellihubnews @ShepardAmbellas So far I do not see mention of burn marks on those curtains. That was just the FIT report though. There should be another report released later in the year. Some kind of Federal documents, forensic details, and other really cool stuff.
@ranivus @LauraLoomer Star Fox. Very nice.
@nbtrailtech @LasVegasCoverUp @iamjohncullen @LauraLoomer @intellihubnews @ShepardAmbellas @YouTube They do run a test and fire rifle rounds through that glass. But it does not crumble away by any means. Then they axe it away. And that‚Äôs just the first layer. That glass is amazing.
@nbtrailtech @LasVegasCoverUp @iamjohncullen @LauraLoomer @intellihubnews @ShepardAmbellas https://t.co/UKy4BBGv1J via @YouTube		I watched this the other day. It made me think about it more. Youll see these big guys really giving that glass hell. Then it made me think about puncture and distance and lost velocity, and it‚Äôs still pretty bizarre. But check it , if u can.
Even Jurassic Park didn‚Äôt have this many issues going on. 	And that had actual dinosaurs on the loose!
@tedcruz It‚Äôs so cute too.
Just so you know folks, blood harvesting, is reportedly common amongst certain underground high society types. They pay big bucks for the stuff.
Hmm...... so you wanted the blood, for the chemicals that the glands produce, when euphoria hits a peak level. I wonder if you used one of those VR head sets on the guy. 	Did you hurt a bunch of kids you sick bastard?
5F-AB-001 is classified as a synthetic cannabinoid. Ok. Does that mean it was there?
Is that a huge list of chemicals, or what?
@AngelFoxToday71 It‚Äôs like .... what good is power, if you can‚Äôt control it? 		Ancient secret maybe? 	A proverb of sorts?
@AngelFoxToday71 That would make them to blame for a lot of the troubles we face in life. In turn, this realized, would cause them to lose the control they once had.
@area51F Those wrinkles on his forehead area, actually mean something. I was researching this last week. If you have a moment and google about it sometime, you may be surprised at what it says.
A fly has been annoying me all night. Landing on my leg and arm, flying away just out of reach. Just a moment ago, I killed it. Rejoice.
The worst part about having played percussion for a long time. You‚Äôre watching a movie with a band playing, knowing damn well the drummer isn‚Äôt playing that hi-hat. Bad sound mixing maybe....
@LauraLoomer I will accept your money and answer questions to the best of my knowledge and ability. That money will be doing more good than you think.
@LauraLoomer I can play the drum part to Tom Sawyer. And many others!		Ya know, the band. Rush.
@RealCandaceO Ya know what I did this weekend? The exact thing I do every weekend. Everything that doesn‚Äôt involve shooting another person. I did my work, then engaged in my hobby. No casualties to speak of.
@RealCandaceO What could‚Äôve caused these shootings over the weekend? Was it gang related? Drugs? A subliminal message on a tv show? 	This isn‚Äôt supposed to be typical behavior of an ordinary gun owner. At least one that does understand and abide by what gun laws there are. 	Whatcha think?
As it turns out, those materials were recovered, intact. That was a pretty hectic situation. I‚Äôm really glad it was resolved with haste.
All those at 5:45? Is that a procedural thing?
I don‚Äôt think I can say what I was thinking about today on a public forum. I‚Äôll save that for the therapy sessions.
Ya know GhostHunters was a pretty good show. They did experience phenomena, but it‚Äôs like ghosts have stage-fright or something. Which is odd, being ghosts and all.
@RealJamesWoods Ya it‚Äôs really sad. I‚Äôve never tried to shoot anyone. I thought I was doing alright getting along with everyone. Really sad.
@KamalaHarris Honestly I couldn‚Äôt have done it any faster. Those hurricanes are really nasty. I saw a few pictures. The whole place looked destroyed. 	It‚Äôs a bloody miracle they are up and running again. Yay!
@clivebushjd @Maggieb1B @realDonaldTrump @GOPLeader @GOP @SenateGOP @WhiteHouse @POTUS @Jim_Jordan @JudgeJeanine @LouDobbs I learned all sorts of things through all of my school career.

This was in no way flag related.I disagree with that form. ‚úåÔ∏èüá∫üá∏ü¶á
@blckriflecoffee Heads up!
@charliekirk11 I literally wish I could do something to help the situation. But what? Everything I‚Äôm naturally inclined to do is against department regulations. And I‚Äôm tied down with no way to get involved with the career in Law Enforcement. But mostly those department regulations...eek
@charliekirk11 These statistics, along with the amount of children that get abducted daily, absolutely destroy me.

@SimonWinfield0 @Terrenc43516485 @BBCBreakfast @BBC @BorisJohnson Years ago I was working downtown on a high rise apartment complex. Weight limit for the service elevator was like 1000 lbs. There I was pushing 160 lugging around 700 lbs of gear. Yeah that bitch was creaking. Safety first.
@SimonWinfield0 @Terrenc43516485 @BBCBreakfast @BBC @BorisJohnson The elevator is too crowded for my own comfort though. It also may exceed the recommended weight limit.
@SimonWinfield0 @Terrenc43516485 @BBCBreakfast @BBC @BorisJohnson Hell yes I would. This group of individuals looks like they might be up to no good. I would use discretion, and proceed with caution.
@slutsnguts It must be powered by straws. That‚Äôs crazy!
@SimonWinfield0 @Terrenc43516485 @BBCBreakfast @BBC @BorisJohnson I‚Äôd probably just take the stairs.... or wait for the next elevator.
@choptopmoseley @12nighthorror Surely there is.
@Tell_Michelle_ The Bible is the actual least offensive thing there is. Hmmm....

@DonaldJTrumpJr @kingtynk This seems to be happening often.
So who could have possibly been piloting that helicopter? Did someone give them an order to do so? 	Or was it stolen? 		All of the answers are out there.
@80sjams Maybe not word for word, but HopSin (sp?) actually has that type of message. And he‚Äôs raw with those rhymes. Word up.
I saw the helicopter, that many of us think was undoubtedly shooting an onboard gun at the crowd. It had a muzzle flash that is viewable. It had a report that was recorded and can be heard.    I think they match. I think it‚Äôs the one. Did you see it yet?
@redlettermedia Gasp. Shitty movies?? Bitchin. Click.
@GroovyBruce I feel the same way in my work clothes. Icky.
This seems like a note to another person or multiple people, as opposed to a personal reminder. 	I don‚Äôt see what it would do at this time.
Unplug phones? Why?
That spotter scope is just sitting there, not being used.
What the were you doing with that drill?.....
@dbongino @DartLucy The grapevine claims they are being paid to do this. I‚Äôm sure they need the money, they just don‚Äôt know what they do is actually wrong. 	‚ÄúFlipping burgers‚Äù is made to be a lowly way of life too. 	There‚Äôs things I would do for money too, this just isn‚Äôt my time. No vandalism.

@rideoneverclear @intellihubnews Damn what a mess. Ok thank you.
@rideoneverclear Titties.
@rideoneverclear @intellihubnews Are you able to see in the report, the casing missing or moved by the left shoulder blade, as well as the body not in the same place over the puddle (of blood)? The two bodies don‚Äôt look alike in the facial region to me. Whatcha think?
@bartmanmarine But if this is all a big joke, then our lives are at risk, of having no one we can depend on to help us. To find, possible assailants that harm the people we care about. To find the Justice we seek as promised. And that is no laughing matter.
@bartmanmarine Plus - what‚Äôs up with damn helicopters?? Those weren‚Äôt mentioned in the report, at all. 	I need to know if it‚Äôs possible to see police car flashy lights from the 32nd floor or not. 	I want to take the Pepsi challenge, to see if the carpet tastes like blood, or jelly donut. ...
@bartmanmarine That‚Äôs what they say Facebook does for some reason. 	I don‚Äôt use Facebook, but I always thought they do certain things for market research.
@bartmanmarine And all these people were uninformed, innocent bystanders, of an elaborate plan with the intention of data collection. Their feelings, their reactions, etc. 	ourselves included.
@bartmanmarine If everything was staged. That means the lady on tv was in no real danger, and she‚Äôs lying to me, and I have to not believe her. 	Or - she wasn‚Äôt in on it, and was used. And that means many people were used. And have been put in harms way.
@bartmanmarine I don‚Äôt have a personal life. This is my life now. For the time being, I am haunted. 	Are we agreeing that the event was staged? To what extent? Meticulously arranged, based on a narrative script? Or just setup like dominoes with a chain reaction?
@bartmanmarine Somebody heard drilling. Fair enough. Drilling sounds like drilling. Nothing else. Was a drill located on the procured items list? 	What does that say about the narrative? Was that information relevant in any way?
@bartmanmarine I just had some dinner finally. 	I think you are right. While most people don‚Äôt have the time, or the stomach for this sort of thing, lucky for them, we do. 	With a mind that‚Äôs wide open and still full of ideas and experience, this situation can be worked through. 	Let‚Äôs think..
@bartmanmarine Because yes, the blowback is immense.
@bartmanmarine Id like to think about that. I‚Äôll try and form a response later tonight.
@AngelFoxToday71 Yup, I like the truth more. If something is false, it won‚Äôt work. True story!
@1776Stonewall I wonder if any arrests were made?
@slutsnguts @MrsGuts77 You get better action from a bassoon. Of a piccolo. Any woodwind instrument should do the trick.
@LauraLoomer Yeah but they have heads up asses. That‚Äôs their chosen profession. To brown nose and bullshit, and get paid to do it. 		Your fans think differently. They actually appreciate you and what you do.
@freedom_moates There are times when it can be excessive. 	Is there any adults that know restraint, as to teach their children the same? 	Otherwise what‚Äôs the chain of action that then occurs? 	The kids grow up, knowing full well violent acts are the only way to solve an issue. Petty ones too.
@AngelFoxToday71 I currently have no classified information. If anyone has any secrets, they must be up to no good. 	If it‚Äôs a file, or a note on a piece of paper, it can be found, it can be shared. 	I really don‚Äôt know what some people are thinking sometimes. It‚Äôs sad, and pathetic.
@AngelFoxToday71 No I can relate. If it were up to me, that fella would be head chief of staff of a newspaper company or something.
@RexTillersom @EdgarChewning Not fair at all. She said something that arouses contempt in the hearts of some citizens. People that could‚Äôve been potential customers. She doesn‚Äôt seem to have that practical sense it takes to work for a business such as she does. Maybe an apology, or a retraction is in order.
@charliekirk11 Yeah they left the door unlocked while they went out for milk. Tsk tsk.
@JoelOsteen I hope it‚Äôs two gen4 Glock 17s And body armor, with a shiny badge that says Federal Investigator on it. An expense account with $75k salary, and two weeks vacation time. Effective immediately. 	How does that sound to you?
@bartmanmarine I think there‚Äôs a policy that disallows those agencies from using social media programs. So they don‚Äôt actually know that we know some details. 	I think that what you are striving to accomplish is proving fruitful, in exposing the corruption that is at hand. I see it too.
@bartmanmarine But that‚Äôs one hell of a report I just read through. Unfortunately, we‚Äôve watched video concerning most of the details prior to it‚Äôs release. You‚Äôd probably agree, there are conflicting details throughout. Much like the few I mentioned earlier.
@bartmanmarine Wow that sounds dumb. So basically they screwed up the whole investigation.
@bartmanmarine And the casing that was about four inches from the body‚Äôs left shoulder. It is not in photo. 	I think this body is a mannequin or something. Or something was disturbed there. It was placed closer towards the camera by mistake. Most of that blood puddle is covered at that time.
@bartmanmarine On page 90. The picture. Are you able to see the casings in the blood stain? I can‚Äôt see the specific casings I‚Äôm familiar with. That whole face looks a little different right now.
@bartmanmarine Hey buddy, I‚Äôm reading the report now too! 	Got my reading coffee here.... 	How can someone pinpoint a detail like with the tank shots? Page 34-37?
@TimLybbert @CraigRSawyer I heard about that too. The ‚Äúpurge‚Äù they called it, to remove corrupt members of a board.
@CraigRSawyer That could be admissible physical evidence, or it could be used to file a life insurance claim, that eventually turns out to be fraudulent. 	What does anyone think about that?
@CraigRSawyer Personally I don‚Äôt think blood works that way. 	It‚Äôs also the opening gag to any James Bond film. Also a Metro Goldwyn Meyer property. Whom also owns the Mandalay Bay Hotel and Resort, right? 	If this video was recorded and acted out in a way, and an effect was added....
@CraigRSawyer I want you to be aware of a video I watched. A person was standing by some metal bleachers. You can hear gun fire, and the ‚Äútink tink‚Äù of what sounds like bullets hitting the metal bleachers. Toward the end of the video, it looks like the person is shot, and a faint red cascades.
@CraigRSawyer After sifting through all the videos and articles available so far, two things come to mind. A heavily funded rouse, or a maniacally crafted prank. Something that causes a disturbance of great magnitude in either case. 	There‚Äôs still more to do.
@JoelOsteen God doesn‚Äôt owe me anything. HE has done enough. Now - I - will repay HIM. ‚úåÔ∏èüá∫üá∏ü¶á
@LauraLoomer @LVMPD @MandalayBay Please excuse that last remark. I care big time. Tons of people have the details already. 	No, you are absolutely correct.
@LauraLoomer @LVMPD @MandalayBay I have too much to say in response for your question. 	My carpel tunnel is killing me right now. Please visit me soon. 	Loomer me if you want. I don‚Äôt care.
@KamalaHarris You can‚Äôt stop nature from happening. Is that what you meant? It was like a class 5 hurricane. There was 3 of them in a row too. That must be brutal. 	Do they have a national weather service that runs period updates  with a warning system?
@w_terrence I‚Äôm rearranging pouches on my utility belt, while thinking about this laundry list of details, while Ip Man 3 is on in the background. 	The Mike Tyson fight is almost on.
What did the lady at the bus stop say? https://t.co/2QUKSsUOtM
Yes, I‚Äôm thinking about all that stuff right now.
@HeyTammyBruce @mellomelsko @nytimes @RealJamesWoods Not true. I, much like many people of a variety of ethnicities, are huge fans of Chinese Martial Arts, and Oriental culture in general. 	She shouldn‚Äôt base her opinions on the way the white people she‚Äôs talking about see the world.
Ya know..... so far, in my lifetime, I‚Äôve never urinated on a fire hydrant. Have I been doing it wrong this whole time? Hmmm.... ü§î
@MiracleWhip The ingredients are different. It‚Äôs a matter of egg whites and egg yolks in one or the other. I know this much. Plus that tangy zip only unicorns can provide.
@ShepardAmbellas I‚Äôll admit it too, it‚Äôs not the worst thing I‚Äôve seen in my life. But something did happen there right? They admit things happened?
@ShepardAmbellas I distinctly recall watching people running in terror. Is that not an element of terror?
@jojoh888 @BeNiceButDefend I wonder why they don‚Äôt just go at a designated time. 	A lot of people attend a Sunday mass at like 11:00 am right? Maybe a nooner? Special prayer on a Tuesdays? Hmmm... ü§®
@blckriflecoffee Those were actual scenarios, that actually can happen. The realism was impeccable. .... and a hand grenade. ‚úåÔ∏èüá∫üá∏ü¶á
@RealJamesWoods @nytimes And I actually have no disposition toward Asian Americans (sic?) or anyone from the Orient for that matter. Jeez.
@RealJamesWoods @nytimes Sun burn on white, or Caucasian people, indicates the level of work they have accomplished. 	Yeah she‚Äôs racist.
@Csinaco @KatTheHammer1 I see she does that public rally speaking technique, like it‚Äôs cool. I wish they would just talk normal sometimes. Ya know.
@PatrioticCindy @awaken_to_maga There‚Äôs a lady running for attorney general, wants to abolish @ICEgov ..... and stuff like this is going on? Come on now.
@blckriflecoffee Seth as well. We know it was decaf..... üòñ
@blckriflecoffee Texas Tomahawk beat me to that one..... 		Good show ol chap.
@blckriflecoffee Decaf.
@josephg19712738 No you are right. I think that is exactly right. That‚Äôs what‚Äôs so badass about it! 	I think it‚Äôs one of the more, if not most inspirational legendary quotes out there. 	Got em sorrounded..... Lol . Good times.
@josephg19712738 Oh buddy, you reminded me of something. 	Sir! They have us blocked on the front. They have us blocked in the rear, and we‚Äôre being flanked on both sides. 		So? What‚Äôs the problem? 		-Chester Pulley 		And that was one of the coolest stories I ever heard.
@josephg19712738 there‚Äôs only one true friend, keeping you alive.
@josephg19712738 One of the biggest roles a sniper does isn‚Äôt actually shooting someone from a distance. Sometimes an observation has to be made over an extended period of time. 	The spirit of the warrior is there to overcome the odds. The test of time. Sometimes when you‚Äôre all alone....
@josephg19712738 Think about Roswell, and how at the time, we weren‚Äôt remotely ready for an interstellar confrontation. I have a feeling, the most vital of information was shared with the right people, at the right time. The whole world was saved for awhile. And that‚Äôs really cool.
@josephg19712738 No. Those criminals shoot first. It isn‚Äôt wise to go and shoot people all cops and robbers. 	Plus there are variables. Methods and tactics that don‚Äôt include ever killing someone. Honestly, and I know this for a fact, that‚Äôs the last thing a person wants to do.
@josephg19712738 apprehend a criminal. 		Of course, the process can be arduous, and painstaking, but in the end, the world can become a better place. For you, me, those people over there, for the kids.
@josephg19712738 While the heart of a warrior rests within us all, that isn‚Äôt the way. 	No, there‚Äôs people out there, really horrible people. Sometimes there‚Äôs an opportunity to compile actual physical evidence. With that evidence, when presented to those that require it, there is a chance to...
@josephg19712738 It‚Äôs been really great talking to you this whole time so far. I have a bunch of work things to do for awhile. I‚Äôll check back with you later. ‚úåÔ∏è
@josephg19712738 And you most certainly are right. Some people just need someone to talk to, to help them through the rough times. That‚Äôs the healing element that can be offered.
@josephg19712738 I think what I mean, is referred to as research and observation. I‚Äôm not saying, we kick in doors and start shooting recklessly. There‚Äôs a huge legal process that goes into the proper execution of law enforcement.
@josephg19712738 Hold on, what do you mean?
@josephg19712738 From what I understand carbon dating only goes back so far too. It sure is interesting though. When I think of, that, on top of Bible history, as well as the ancient Mayans, there‚Äôs so much to learn still.
@josephg19712738 The Illinois area.
@josephg19712738 @LauraLoomer @925_master @IlhanMN @keithellison The setback. I‚Äôm owed a lot of money. It may never be resolved. I‚Äôm willing to be picked up by any law enforcement agency and get to work. Craig Sawyer perhaps. I like what he‚Äôs doing. I just might be too much of a loose canon. I think what he‚Äôs do by is the best right now.
@josephg19712738 @LauraLoomer @925_master @IlhanMN @keithellison Some geologists speculate the Earth is closer to 13 billion years old. I have no explanation, that‚Äôs just what was said. Even time as we know it to be has been changed throughout history, so it‚Äôs kind of just up on the air for now.
@josephg19712738 @LauraLoomer @925_master @IlhanMN @keithellison I think most of what I know can only be applied, when and where needed. 	In order to take the pebble, you have to first reach for it.
@josephg19712738 @LauraLoomer @925_master @IlhanMN @keithellison That‚Äôs just it. There‚Äôs so much that I want to do to make that change happen, I feel that I am not where I need to be. 	Sure, I‚Äôm needed where I am, but I think I have skills that can be put to use elsewhere. 	Im only in a development stage. Researching, and socializing.
@josephg19712738 @LauraLoomer @925_master @IlhanMN @keithellison According to my zodiac, I crave knowledge, and holy cow, is there a lot out there.
@josephg19712738 @LauraLoomer @925_master @IlhanMN @keithellison I grew up near a fabulous public library. There a person can research anything from animal biology, to the occult, and beyond the solar system. 	A good portion of what keeps our knowledge of any subject firm is peer discussion. 	And horror movies.
@josephg19712738 @LauraLoomer @925_master @IlhanMN @keithellison Lately I‚Äôm kinda iffy. 	It breaks my heart, when I read about, our younger generations being misled. The abuse of children wherever it may occur, a holy war against good people. There‚Äôs so much out there. 	I wish I could be out there really getting my hands dirty.
@josephg19712738 @LauraLoomer @925_master @IlhanMN @keithellison properly, like we would all like it to. 	Not just yet. I have read about extraterrestrial involvement, which apparently is very bad, according to those classes of alien race. 	Ethics, responsibility, resources, all come into the scenario on a cosmic level.
@josephg19712738 @LauraLoomer @925_master @IlhanMN @keithellison Have you ever heard about the Philadelphia experiment? Not the movie that‚Äôs based on it, but the actual military report? 	I think it‚Äôs been declassified for public research. You can freely peruse the report. 	Based on the consequences involved, yes, this technology won‚Äôt work..
@josephg19712738 @LauraLoomer @925_master @IlhanMN @keithellison Ya know I think you are right. Breaks my heart sometimes, when I see some of what I do. I was always a pretty laid back kind of person.
@josephg19712738 @LauraLoomer @925_master @IlhanMN @keithellison The people with the hadron collider are playing with dark matter. 	Sober. USA. Please forgive me, I do have an extensive interest in multiple fields.
@josephg19712738 @LauraLoomer @925_master @IlhanMN @keithellison So you‚Äôre saying it may be possible?
@josephg19712738 @LauraLoomer @925_master @IlhanMN @keithellison A good motto I know - prepare for the worst, hope for the best. 		Yes, if a guy like that ever starts up a thing in such a way, there‚Äôs laser eyes, on it. With a grain of salt for now.
@josephg19712738 @LauraLoomer @925_master @IlhanMN @keithellison I think it‚Äôs happening now. In the way the some media outlets portray certain cultures, religions, and races of people. It‚Äôs subtle propaganda that may effect some people. 	Personally I‚Äôm desensitized to it, though I am acknowledging that it may exist. I won‚Äôt name names yet.
@josephg19712738 @LauraLoomer @925_master @IlhanMN @keithellison Maybe. The technology was blueprinted and partially engineered then. There‚Äôs quite a bit of technology out there that derives from those blueprints. Yup still on Earth.
@josephg19712738 @LauraLoomer @925_master @IlhanMN @keithellison That‚Äôs exactly what I read too. At the time the whole family was hunted down. Right. There is the concept of body doubles to think about.
@true_pundit @Brandi_Lou_79 Probe off. 		Grrrrr.
@Thomas1774Paine @Brandi_Lou_79 Every time some guy asks me for an ok to probe, I tell ‚Äòem to go probe them self. 	Dude, what‚Äôs up with that look?
@juniman73 @wiptick @deplorablem1ke @CraigRSawyer Yeah deploy hackers to locate the source material, drop a line and infiltrate. Jack pot.
@wiptick @Julia5180 So that must mean there is a person or group of persons making child pornography somewhere. I can‚Äôt imagine that being a traceable thing.

Good ol magic cats.
@josephg19712738 @LauraLoomer @925_master @IlhanMN @keithellison Hehe yeah if I waved hi, he‚Äôd know what‚Äôs up. You got that right.
@josephg19712738 @LauraLoomer @925_master @IlhanMN @keithellison I wasn‚Äôt exactly existing at that time, no..... but the thing is, if he was seen, then that means everything taught in my history classes was untrue. 	Or. 	It means that there has been a disturbance in space/time. 	Consideration in respect to 	Bell Glocken. Or ET help. Thoughts?
@Anon_decoder That‚Äôs sound advice too. They don‚Äôt do enough research to get the story straight. It‚Äôs like that 15 minutes can take all year. Ya know?
@josephg19712738 @LauraLoomer @925_master @IlhanMN @keithellison Quick history debate. So Adolf Hitler and the last remaining faction of the Reich was said to have established an underground base in Antarctica. Yet he was recently reported to have been in the states in the late ‚Äò50‚Äôs. Thoughts?
@josephg19712738 @LauraLoomer @925_master @IlhanMN @keithellison I‚Äôve been watching John Carpenters - The Thing. I‚Äôll probably just move to Antarctica soon. I don‚Äôt think pedophiles and goat fuckers can survive the cold. It will be paradise, I swear.
@LauraLoomer I‚Äôll put THAT in my pipe and smoke it! 	Honestly I hate pills, but what you just said - I Concur.
@andersonDrLJA Same rules apply in the kitchen.
@josephg19712738 @LauraLoomer @925_master @IlhanMN @keithellison Oh man, it‚Äôs so frustrating.
@LadyThriller69 @fortner_jasmine Acronym is what I meant. 	Good one.
@LadyThriller69 @fortner_jasmine Nice anagram.
@LauraLoomer @littlebitirish If things are happening, like you‚Äôve been reporting.... yes. Yes I agree.
@josephg19712738 @LauraLoomer @925_master @IlhanMN @keithellison Sometimes people ask me where I‚Äôve been so long, living under a rock? 	I then refer to news like this and it all makes sense. 	Yup, they have sex with goats and children, and I will have no part in that.
@LauraLoomer But it‚Äôs something that could possibly give the man his sight back. 	Ya know this is horrible. When I was 18, I was working a job, dealing with family problems. Played Final Fantasy games for fun.	I dun know. üòê
@LauraLoomer I read your article. I sat in silence for awhile. Many thoughts of dread and vengeance come to mind. I cannot act out at this time. 	I was reading a modern science magazine years ago. There is an operation that allows vision through robotics. Idk if that makes this right.
.@CNN 	This is what‚Äôs going on. There is suspicion of abduction going around. Large groups of people are being reported missing. There may be a connection, I‚Äôm probably not able to elaborate on. Check it out if you can. https://t.co/OV0nVSqRdO
@CNN Nah, there‚Äôs so many other problems going on right now, this coat isn‚Äôt very important. 		Do you know anything about those missing people recently? 		Can you work up a report on that? It might help a lot.
@realDonaldTrump @littlebitirish I don‚Äôt think you did anything wrong. I can see how crazy everything is out there. You did really awesome keeping relationships.
@ShepardAmbellas @intellihubnews I really wonder what happened to that window. If it wasn‚Äôt broken at first, but it was broken after..... and we just saw that one thing.... then that means other things!
@realDonaldTrump @PeterRosianul I bet it‚Äôs Paul Manafort. I‚Äôve got one of those gut feelings about this.
@TheCalPatriot I‚Äôll need to see an itemized list of expenses first. This estimation seems far beyond reason.
@Hal__Roberts I feel like I‚Äôm not tweeting all the swearing and obscenities right now. 	Understand, there are many.
@Hal__Roberts Ok. Why would a cleaning solution hose line be anywhere near a milk supply line?
@intellihubnews @YouTube It does look like that.
RT @Tell_Michelle_: Alex Jones is fake news. He‚Äôs done so much harm! He‚Äôs not a voice of the people, he‚Äôs a voice for himself. You shouldn‚Äô‚Ä¶

@bartmanmarine @The_StormIsHere @LauraLoomer @realDonaldTrump @RealMattCouch @csthetruth @Kevin_Shipp @TuckerCarlson Was that group of people vaping or hanging out still there in the venue area at 12:16 AM Oct 2nd 2017? They would be able to testify to this activity taking place. That would help.
@bartmanmarine @The_StormIsHere @LauraLoomer @realDonaldTrump @RealMattCouch @csthetruth @Kevin_Shipp @TuckerCarlson I hate the fact that I‚Äôve already seen graphics added into you tube thumbnails. Do you remember the 9/11 videos? Some guy has a claim about MIT level cgi being used at the time. It makes the situation all messed up.
@markrmorley @AIIAmericanGirI @100PercFEDUP According to the report, many if not all of those missing are in the same general area. Also in a short period of time.
@The_StormIsHere @LauraLoomer @realDonaldTrump @RealMattCouch @csthetruth @Kevin_Shipp @TuckerCarlson They just barely caught that in film.
@bartmanmarine @The_StormIsHere @LauraLoomer @realDonaldTrump @RealMattCouch @csthetruth @Kevin_Shipp @TuckerCarlson I have a video saved that shows the first gunshots can be heard around 9:50 PM, Oct. 1st. 2017. 		This video we just watched is filmed at about 12:16 AM, Oct. 2nd, 2017. 		Does that seem accurate?
@The_StormIsHere @LauraLoomer @realDonaldTrump @RealMattCouch @csthetruth @Kevin_Shipp @TuckerCarlson There is no gun sound, no muzzle flash. There is a burst that is viewable, that causes what looks like pieces of glass to fall. The reflection of light is visible, at this time. I believe this takes place after the point in time, that police had arrived in the hotel room 135.
@The_StormIsHere @LauraLoomer @realDonaldTrump @RealMattCouch @csthetruth @Kevin_Shipp @TuckerCarlson It looks like the glass was breaking out. I acknowledge and confirm, at that time, we do see what looks like glass breaking. 	This seems to be taking place after the point in time, there was any reported gunfire.
Check this out. You will see. https://t.co/UWPWYjbgiX
@bartmanmarine @christacyvegas @realDonaldTrump Actually Richard Marx. Still good. 		I‚Äôll check the archive.
@bartmanmarine @christacyvegas @realDonaldTrump I‚Äôll be right here waiting for you. 		Bryan Adams.
@LauraLoomer I just read about that guy recently. The attempt to bomb the WTC. Nasty stuff. He‚Äôs in a prison not far from me.
@bartmanmarine @christacyvegas @realDonaldTrump No. I‚Äôll watch it if I‚Äôm allowed to. 	This is body cam footage, correct?
@DLoesch @GaryZettle You would still have to purchase somehow - gun powder, primers, cast the casings, the actual bullets, load the casings, while knowing if the load is good or not. Sounds like a hobby.
@DLoesch @GaryZettle How would it be possible to print a recoil buffer spring? I would think that would have to be produced through an extrusion process.....???
I realize I may have no sense of humor anymore. I really don‚Äôt know what to do about that.
@christacyvegas @bartmanmarine @realDonaldTrump Oh ..... üòï ok good one! Yeah I got it now.
@bartmanmarine @christacyvegas @realDonaldTrump Did you watch the infomercials for those storm shutters they sell for Florida homes? Those things are badass. They shoot the 2x4 at the shutter and it actually stops the wood from penetrating. 	I‚Äôve broken so much glass though. I‚Äôve been in the window business.
@christacyvegas @bartmanmarine @realDonaldTrump I can easily break that glass with the little mallet that was shown in the room.
@bartmanmarine @LauraLoomer @gelicmonkey This is good. Very good news.
@bartmanmarine @Occupy007 @intellihubnews Look at the way those two casings are on top of the older looking blood. They look clean and placed.
@bartmanmarine @Occupy007 @intellihubnews Yeah, I‚Äôm looking at it again. It‚Äôs like.... there‚Äôs newer blood on top of older blood. That .38 looks really far away too. 	I‚Äôm trying to imagine it being flung so far ..... it‚Äôs just not working. 	There‚Äôs no skull or brain chunks in the blood puddle. What do you think?
@cyanpotato @JBaker31826004 That question is generally racist. 		Positive people have a positive effect. 	Negative people have a negative effect.

@mixedopinionss Do you mean with the meth addiction? Or the eating disorder?
@ChristieC733 Do they use Twitter?
Attention!!! 		Does anyone know anything about this? 		Missing people - children !! What‚Äôs up? https://t.co/KKcVqBFxLV
@AnitaDidomenic1 Ok so this was happening in Kansas last year. Now Iowa. There seems to be a connection. Fraudulent activity in the social service department. I‚Äôll be thinking about this now. Thank you.
@AnitaDidomenic1 Yes, i ask this question daily. All this stuff going on. I literally wish I could go hunt for these people.
@AnitaDidomenic1 @eternatives  https://t.co/I9RWfrbhRt
@AnitaDidomenic1 @eternatives Of course I‚Äôm concerned.
@AnitaDidomenic1 @eternatives It was a 20 year old female from Iowa.
@AnitaDidomenic1 @eternatives I found a missing person flyer on the door at the gas station I go to. So I took a pic with my phone at least.... idk what‚Äôs up yet. Eyes peeled, but I don‚Äôt get out much.
@AngelFoxToday71 That‚Äôs like one of Newton‚Äôs laws of physics.
@mixedopinionss @KP2223 I know that people have done that though. They go through an event in life and come across meth. They get what they want from it.  I may have peer mediated a situation like that. That person is now still alive and probably one of the greatest people I know. Meth is dumb.
@mixedopinionss ‚ÄúDrop the fork!‚Äù ‚ÄúDrop the fork! Move away from the plate of food!‚Äù 		‚ÄúBut I neeeeeeed it‚Äù 		‚ÄúI‚Äôll do it! I‚Äôll open fire right now‚Äù 	‚ÄúSwat team move! Go go go!!!!‚Äù 		‚ÄúAaaagggghhhhh‚Äù		News brief - an alleged food eating plot was averted..... no one was harmed. 	Now the weather....
@mixedopinionss And it‚Äôs an opinionated classification of actions deemed only by certain groups or agencies. Some people have eating disorders. Police officers don‚Äôt pull the food away at gunpoint though. Hmmmmm?
@thoc66_tara @Felicia1669 @realDonaldTrump What an odd thing to say. The president as chief diplomat should most certainly meet with other foreign diplomats. 	What was going on back in 2014? 	I remember having personal issues at the time.
@realDonaldTrump @BFISA That‚Äôs a matter of international security.
@freedom_moates How does an article like that come to be? When people start dating they tend to go to places that reflect their interests. Hobbies aside, there‚Äôs certain places, mostly bars. Singles bars, gay bars, straight bars, sports, biker, and the like. Even birds of a feather ya know.
@freedom_moates Well honesty is the foundation of a relationship, sooooo, Yeah, lay the cards down.
@pokerqueen1215 @LazyMeatball The obverse, and what else I meant was an illegal alien, having relations with a person that already is a citizen, natural born or otherwise, who has been a fugitive of some kind. I would expect that person to be in a legal dispute, if not facing deportation, or a prison sentence
@pokerqueen1215 @LazyMeatball And those babies born here have certain rights as well I would presume? A parent or guardian would also have to be in accordance with all federal, state, and local laws, while obtaining citizenship, right?
@RealBamaCowboy @AlicesDaughter Heh heh. Classic.
@pokerqueen1215 @LazyMeatball Sooooo, does this ‚Äúanchor baby‚Äù thing mean someone could be an actual undocumented person, maybe also a multiple felon, that somehow forces a sexual relationship with someone, that then has a child born here, ...... and then what? That‚Äôs a real nasty situation. Hmmm....ü§®
@RealBamaCowboy @AlicesDaughter You did it again Mister. That was a marvelous bunch of words you just laid down.
@USArmy @173rdAbnBde Sweet.
@RyanAFournier I heard the previous administration caused a problem at the VA office. There otherwise would be a fairly concrete and well made healthcare plan for veterans.
@Education4Libs @joannarn4kids That affects me personally. I demand they apologize.
@Education4Libs @joannarn4kids I remember just working a lot. I work as much if not more now, but I‚Äôm on Twitter now. Sooooo, at least we can communicate in some way. 	I seriously never heard or read news about Obama back then. Maybe I was kept in the dark. IDK!
@realDonaldTrump Think about all the technology we have at our disposal. Satellite imagery, lasers, artillary, gunships, platoons of hounds, just to start the list. 	There must be a problem somewhere. Are we all on the same page? Same time zone? I had a real nasty history lesson recently.
@Education4Libs @jsherm268 Those are some pretty ambiguous comments. I wonder if they would care to elaborate? Hmmmm? ü§®
@SarahPalinUSA People do speak using sarcasm. It is not as easily recognized by people that don‚Äôt understand it. 	It could be a psychological coping mechanism. If the director was speaking in this manner, maybe that‚Äôs just what was happening.
@SarahPalinUSA If the director isn‚Äôt an actual convicted child molester or pedophile, then we‚Äôd have to examine the nature of context contained in the tweeting. Mockery in text form is common, but easily taken out of context by an outside viewer.
@SiddonsDan @Maggieb1B @IvanTrumpovic1 @RubyRockstar333 @Krissy_MAGA @Jillibean557 @PatrioticVa @Trump454545 @ReneeCarrollAZ One day at a time fella. Any ideas? What‚Äôs the biggest problems you see on your daily grind?
@CraigRSawyer I think what we‚Äôre talking about is much older adults that are attempting to abduct and or seduce any person under the age of legal consent for whatever means of gratification they may obtain. 	All of this is inherently wrong and henceforth illegal. And for reasons.
@CraigRSawyer This is different. A person 18 years or older wouldn‚Äôt typically have any way of dating a 10 year old, for example. The only possible means is abduction, or through molestation. The parents or legal guardians wouldn‚Äôt allow that, usually.
@CraigRSawyer Statutory rape is something in affect in my current state. So if a man is 18 years of age, and his lady friend is 17 years of age, even if the very next day the 18 birthday occurs, there could be grounds for a rape trial. That wouldn‚Äôt typically happen between dating couples.
@CraigRSawyer Because they are basically criminally insane, Craig. 	It‚Äôs not like a relationship to them. 	You ever rent a movie? Yeah they don‚Äôt return the movie all the time. They are not kind. They do not rewind.
@LauraLoomer They couldn‚Äôt just jerk each other off real quick ya know. 	I feel bad for the goat, I really do. 	I‚Äôll remember this. One day, this memory will serve its purpose.
@realDonaldTrump A physical barrier, strategically placed, is a necessary means of defense. If this wasn‚Äôt covered in that Omni-bus bill, then what was? I‚Äôm never going to see one red cent from any funding anywhere. Come pick me up. I am low. I am so low. I am below low.
@LauraLoomer It‚Äôs possible he was mocking pediphiles that whole time. It‚Äôs difficult to know for sure without proper surveillance.
@NeoGeoCrypto @w_terrence Haha Red Balls.
@LauraLoomer I have string handy. I mean literally within reach.
@LauraLoomer They just volunteered to be cannon fodder.
@LauraLoomer That‚Äôs gross. Those people should be castrated. Or exploded. Whichever happens first.
@LauraLoomer @Ocasio2018 Sometimes bank loans become overextended and they have to foreclose. It‚Äôs not violence. It‚Äôs a financial agreement that was faulted upon.
@GIJoeOPS @MisterB76428978 @POTUS It‚Äôs like there‚Äôs a type of person, they always say the same things. 	‚ÄúI say whatever the F I want!.‚Äù	‚ÄúI don‚Äôt give a F what you say!‚Äù	‚ÄúI don‚Äôt give a F! Listen to me, and shut the F up!‚Äù	F this. F that. Then a fight occurs. No progress is made. 	It‚Äôs all Trumps too.
@Liz_Wheeler There‚Äôs probably tons of ways to free up some revenue. There was 5 tons of revenue confiscated just last week. 		Don‚Äôt touch the oven! HOT!
@AngelFoxToday71 There is bound to be some folks out there that can help, if you set up the go fund you. 		What‚Äôs wrong with your mom?
@realDonaldTrump I probably would‚Äôve saved a few mil for some snacks.
@realDonaldTrump They could‚Äôve just given me $250,000,000 so I can burn it in the fire pit  I‚Äôm about to light up.
@NevadaElJefe That‚Äôs interesting, every once in awhile, I get what looks like a hooker or something. So I don‚Äôt follow. Why is this an issue?? 	I dun know!
@blckriflecoffee It‚Äôs a Mr. Coffee, but I‚Äôm open to suggestions.
@Tell_Michelle_ I drink out of the same sippy cup all day. Everyday. 		The best part of waking up....üéº	#Foldgers 		@blckriflecoffee
@ollieisyms I wish I could vote all of the above..... but you know what I need!
@LauraLoomer Can you keep a secret?
@mixedopinionss I need a paycheck bad. 	It‚Äôs like .00001 % of all these expenses. Maybe less. Jeez.
@mixedopinionss I know we talked about stuff earlier, but this is something else man.
@bartmanmarine @Occupy007 @intellihubnews Would those drug elements also show in an oxidized blood sample?
Lol - ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a duck hunt.‚Äù
@bartmanmarine @Occupy007 @intellihubnews Take note of the hair line - or lack of, and the beard growth. 		I think we‚Äôve been shown 3-5 different people altogether. 	Do they all have the same name? All with military background, from different eras?
@bartmanmarine @Occupy007 @intellihubnews BP - being his blood pulse right? 	The adrenaline, the heat of the moment, the heart beats faster to supply blood flow and oxygen to the brain and other vital organs. 	The diazepam or what have you, was already burned through right?
@bartmanmarine @Occupy007 @intellihubnews Plus - was there two gsw present on that body?
@bartmanmarine @Occupy007 @intellihubnews The differences were many! 		We can speculate on the origin of that body, whether a morgue, the casino floor, an alley way bum maybe. They just weren‚Äôt similar.
@bartmanmarine @Occupy007 @intellihubnews Howdy parter. I really agree with you. Over a decade ago I was able to peruse a website that contained photographic evidence of homicide and suicides with all types of firearms. 	Months ago we made a detailed comparison of his stats versus what we see on the floor.
@TheRealStanLee As to not be greedy and upset the Watchers, but if I could just slow down, or temporarily stop the flow of time, that would be terrific. There‚Äôs so much work to do!
@politicalHEDGE Is it Parvo?
@AngelFoxToday71 I don‚Äôt really have much money right now. I just think, there are reasons, that what you are doing is right.
@bartmanmarine @Occupy007 @intellihubnews It would take a big group of people to arrange all the luggage, ready to roll up ‚Äúunnoticed‚Äù , with all the ingredients. What‚Äôs in that manual? Oh I could imagine.
@bartmanmarine @Occupy007 @intellihubnews Did you see that video of Steve‚Äôs firearm training? 	So this guy was in the cia, and possibly antifa (at his age??) , and sold houses for a real estate company, but also just gambled at electronic slot machines. I barely have time to make a sandwich for lunch.
@bartmanmarine @Occupy007 @intellihubnews I‚Äôd have to wonder if he even frequents that restaurant.
@bartmanmarine @Occupy007 @intellihubnews Ya know to keep the flies from buzz buzzin.
@bartmanmarine @Occupy007 @intellihubnews üòé was he even on WiFi do you think? He was just video monitoring.  Well prepared. He even had that possible alibi with the antifa menu. Bait and switch. Maybe.
@bartmanmarine @Occupy007 @intellihubnews Things happen. The stock market is a ride of its own, true. It could be entirely unrelated.
@bartmanmarine @Occupy007 @intellihubnews He may just have done that. The  drive was missing. So I‚Äôll take that at face value. Some magic pixie out there has the key to the castle bro.
@bartmanmarine @Occupy007 @intellihubnews That was a lot of money. Too much money is getting thrown around for them not to care. This could be huge.
@bartmanmarine @Occupy007 @intellihubnews For months now, certain groups were levying complaints about stuff. It‚Äôs like..... how open and free, yet tight-nit secure can he make it? 	Even claims of it being used for information gathering other than what you put on there, don‚Äôt scare people off the site.
@bartmanmarine @Occupy007 @intellihubnews FB just lost big time yesterday. I don‚Äôt use it. But what if that was part of the grand scheme? Idk....
@bartmanmarine @Occupy007 @intellihubnews Yup. This is big.
@bartmanmarine @Occupy007 @intellihubnews He was running surveillance is what you‚Äôre saying.
@bartmanmarine @Occupy007 @intellihubnews I agree. Deep down, I think a whole slew of people were in this scenario. There‚Äôs still accessories. Not just fingers on the triggers.
@bartmanmarine @Occupy007 @intellihubnews Do you mean the HD? Or a what if kinda thing?
@bartmanmarine @Occupy007 @intellihubnews Oh heck. We were talking about ballistic anomaly, and trajectories, and magic pixie dust back then. The stuff that has come to light since then....
@bartmanmarine @Occupy007 @intellihubnews The scale of justice, folks. It‚Äôs like it knows all, but it cannot interfere. We have to put the pieces where they belong.
@bartmanmarine @Occupy007 @intellihubnews We find ourselves working with a scale of sorts. Each side can tip either way. There are amounts of things being put in place to tip the scale. One side may be filled naturally. One side has people working to fill the side. This has occurred in preemptive fashion too.
@Occupy007 @intellihubnews @bartmanmarine Unlike myself, people aren‚Äôt totally dumb. They probably understand attorney/client relationships. They know about that deep state stuff and how guys in suits show up at doors. They have spoken nonetheless.
@Occupy007 @intellihubnews @bartmanmarine I talked to someone that was there all day months ago. Showed me video of some activity.
@DavidHo66029379 I see you.
@politicalHEDGE He‚Äôs blaming an entire country that is the size of most of the rest of the world.		I‚Äôll just get back to my movie.....
Howard The Duck. 		Its on because, reasons.
@mixedopinionss Depression and manic episodes are said to be the leading causes of suicide and murder. Bi polar 2 , just came to my attention the other day. It‚Äôs subtle and very troublesome for a person. Try and research these topics if you have time. It explains a lot.
@mixedopinionss But watch out for chainsaw wielding maniacs while on vacation. That‚Äôs just a basic tell-tale sign!
@mixedopinionss Sure are. What‚Äôs stranger is how normal they can be! 	I‚Äôve studied the subject, I thought about it earlier today before I started ranting just now. There‚Äôs no way to determine this beforehand.
@mixedopinionss There‚Äôs brainwashing out there too. It‚Äôs not uncommon to be motivated by subliminal methods.
@mixedopinionss Personally, there‚Äôs too much good, that life has to offer. If you know someone that may be experiencing problems, try to help. It never hurts to try.
@mixedopinionss We‚Äôve probably read accounts of serial killers and their testimony. They kill for a specific reason. Usually it‚Äôs personal. They get a specific need from each committed act. 	But cold blood? When passion takes over? It could be fate. 	Deep down, if it‚Äôs wrong, you can turn away.
@mixedopinionss *There. 		So, I think it‚Äôs a reaction of some kind. A person shouldn‚Äôt naturally be inclined to commit the act, but it‚Äôs there. It‚Äôs in our instinct to do so. Maybe it‚Äôs God. It‚Äôs happened many times, and the blame is on God. But that‚Äôs not right. 	Maybe it‚Äôs self defense too.
@mixedopinionss The first solution is always the same. To remove the person entirely. It‚Äôs not until a person has the blood on their hands that they begin to feel the regret of their actions. 	Just as you have asked, how can someone do that? It‚Äôs so wrong. Just the same, why is their a reason?
@mixedopinionss We see in the news, maybe in public, and history, actual horrible people. They themselves don‚Äôt even commit murder, but when you look at these types of people, and with a clear mind really judge them, not by what they‚Äôve done otherwise, you see how horrible they can be.
@mixedopinionss In the most basic terms. Money. As it is said to be the root of all evil, murder is pretty much the worst thing a person can do. 	Because of money, debts, thievery of, people have been murdered because of it. 	Sometimes adultery can cause a person to want to murder.
@mixedopinionss What‚Äôs the worst thing that‚Äôs been done to you? Have you been robbed? Ridiculed repeatedly? Have you witnessed behavior in another person that won‚Äôt be resolved by just talking about it? How about, enslaved? 		Of course, there‚Äôs never a reason good enough. I never killed someone.
@mixedopinionss I did a little research for a valid description of ‚Äúcold blood‚Äù murder. It mostly pertains to anything premeditated. So thought was put in and planned. 	So first we‚Äôd need to think about things that, are not murder, that are still bad, that can be done to a person.
@PikeNickels @GroovyBruce Excellent view. That is priceless.
@TJMAGA25 @poconomtn @TRPhrophet Understood. Jeez.

@TJMAGA25 @poconomtn @TRPhrophet We need Marijuana legalized! STAT ASAP like years ago.
@LauraLoomer @bostonpolice If he had a terror plot, it didn‚Äôt get to blossom. Somebody out there is probably dissatisfied about that. .....
@LauraLoomer @bostonpolice Have you watched Zodiac yet? The movie kind of explains a lot. Not about a serial killer right now, but the way things work I think.
@TJMAGA25 @poconomtn @TRPhrophet I know crystal meth was hot for awhile. That‚Äôs a pretty sick one. 	Oh yeah the pills. Those opioid pills are going around the eastern area. Overly prescribed meds are the worst.
@TJMAGA25 @poconomtn @TRPhrophet What are the kids these days doing..... tide pods, Trojans, what else?
@thescoop_STEEVE It can‚Äôt be the - dumbest - government policy ever. What about the straws? And natural rain water collection ban in the Seattle area? Those are pretty dumb.
@TJMAGA25 @poconomtn @TRPhrophet There was a stat in recent times, that claims, up to 40% of $1 bills in circulation, have remnants of cocaine on them.
@TJMAGA25 @poconomtn @TRPhrophet Cocaine and straws go together like bread and butter.

@SarahPalinUSA Yeah..... what?
@CoreyLMJones @TRPhrophet I don‚Äôt support that agenda. Nope.
@poconomtn @TRPhrophet You can be high on cocaine, strangling a baby with an umbilical cord, smashing stars with pick axes. It‚Äôs totally ok! 		Do not attempt to use a straw. You have been warned. Violators will be prosecuted.
@politicalHEDGE And those court cases get thrown straight out.
@AngelFoxToday71 @Julian Yeah. He‚Äôs a badass dude.

@JewelsJones1 @CaliConsrvative @carrieksada @grizzlemeister @steph93065 @AMErikaNGIRLBOT @michaelbeatty3 @starcrosswolf @wraithvenge @KamVTV @HSara1975 @CaliConsNews Paper straws suck. They get all soggy, and probably fall apart. Then the whole purpose of the object negates itself. Jeez. üòê
@blckriflecoffee Yes.

Exactly! I don‚Äôt understand the reasoning behind what happened. You‚Äôre bringing up a really valid point. Cause I do like a milkshake too. I will need a straw too.
@bartmanmarine @RICHARDRENO2 @true_pundit @Terrenc43516485 @ShepardAmbellas Contradictory everything. But it‚Äôs already been said. You already know everything I could say about that. ‚úåÔ∏èüá∫üá∏ü¶á
@KamalaHarris Who drafted the form?
@mixedopinionss There‚Äôs quite a bit of explaining involved here. I‚Äôd love to talk more about it sometime.
@hersheysweet Hey there. I just checked back with you. I‚Äôm really glad to see your update, and that your loved one has been found. 	Is everyone alright?
@Qtastic3 @SarahCorriher Ok I‚Äôll look into that. I thought I was the only one in my area.

This isn‚Äôt an end all for all straws of any kind right? 	It‚Äôs kind of a staple for chain restaurant beverages. Sup?
@mixedopinionss @ChickfilA 70
@LauraLoomer @jack @TwitterSupport @parscale I can see you now. I also found you in search. 	Are you sure about what‚Äôs going on? 	Or am I special or something?.....
@TWPundit Keep in mind allegations or suspicion of activity doesn‚Äôt mean conviction. Can we take this with a grain of salt for now?
@TWPundit I saw Tom Hanks in a photo earlier, with two black women, he had a note that said he couldn‚Äôt talk. 	I don‚Äôt know much else about it.
@TWPundit I think Tom Hanks has been abducted or something.
@Qtastic3 @SarahCorriher I thought I signed up for anti-terrorist training. Can we start being terrorists to the terrorists? 	We need to have a committee meeting or something, and put some parchment to good use.
@rn_deplorable @biker4marriage Yeah I think I feel the same way. He was getting played right?
@DonaldJTrumpJr @Maggieb1B It won‚Äôt matter what I say here.
@R_Love317 @realTylerZed @Pink_About_it This is widely agreed upon, yes. It‚Äôs shitty, but that‚Äôs the tactic used to keep regular people from getting too worried. You‚Äôve been paying attention.
@realTylerZed @Education4Libs That‚Äôs cute. Is there any explanation as to, why, he thinks the NRA is to blame? Or did he just come out of nowhere with that remark?
@Education4Libs Is the Rio Grande River a specific detail of the scientific report? 	If so, can an alternative body of water be created?
@LauraLoomer @realDonaldTrump Hormones.
@SuzaSusza hvy
@TimRunsHisMouth Sick burn, Tim.
@thescoop_STEEVE I don‚Äôt even want the stupid straw.
@TheNYevening @dsdr2011 I wouldn‚Äôt expect any media coverage on this for a minute. Whoever needs to do some stuff first. 	It‚Äôs nice to know what we‚Äôre dealing with though. I hear there‚Äôs small factions in locations all over. Is that confirmed?
@CandyCaulton I see a little resemblance. They would have had to get fake id and birth records, and get jobs in high places, and be big spending lobbyists......

@TheNYevening @DartLucy I think it‚Äôs being said wrong. 	It‚Äôs not the country you hate, but the troubles we can face. 	There‚Äôs no sense in crying about it, try lending a hand where possible.
I have to pass out so hard right now. I must go to eat Panda Express before I eat myself. Sadly, I must wait much longer.

With all these headlines, all these police, are you saying there isn‚Äôt progress that can be made toward civility? Try really talking to the people, in the areas of greatest concern. At least try.
@WomenForTrump4 @realDougieD @BreitbartNews Educate your citizens.
@WomenForTrump4 @realDougieD @BreitbartNews Show me some sign of life old man. You look worn out. Get some chocolate milk.
@WomenForTrump4 @realDougieD @BreitbartNews Sign a bill that pays my labor bill.
@WomenForTrump4 @realDougieD @BreitbartNews What is the specific target of this legislation, I wonder? Is it the Chicago area gang problem? Is it a racial issue? Are there still hate crimes? 	Everyone I know gets along wonderfully. 	With all the problems we face, we need to be armed.
@WomenForTrump4 @realDougieD @BreitbartNews This doesn‚Äôt work for me. 	Example. Your neighbor doesn‚Äôt like your dog. The neighbor calls the police anonymously and claims you have a gun and are acting violent. Without conducting an investigation, they confiscate your gun. Now a legal battle ensues. Don‚Äôt forget due process.

@JimmyBeam18 @Maggieb1B I saw you made your mark. I followed anyway. Howdy fella! 	‚úåÔ∏èüá∫üá∏ü¶á
@AngelFoxToday71 @JulianAssange Otherwise, there‚Äôs always a halo jump with a squirrel suit. Snatch and grab, with the fireworks downtown. But that‚Äôs just me. There‚Äôs probably a particular due process in order.
@AngelFoxToday71 @JulianAssange I really hope he gets to where he needs to be, safe and sound. That‚Äôs all I can do.
@AngelFoxToday71 @JulianAssange From what I understand he‚Äôs in a safe place right now. So that‚Äôs cool. There‚Äôs tons of issues that need to be ironed out.
@AngelFoxToday71 @JulianAssange Which is why I‚Äôd rather see him outside of harms way.
@AngelFoxToday71 @JulianAssange Yup it sucks. They lost a hand of poker.	My suspicion, and the problem I see, is that, that fella may be being held, against his will, and is being used for alternative intelligence gathering, to benefit unknown enemies of the state and its allies. I‚Äôll need to do more research.
@AngelFoxToday71 @JulianAssange Having that information shared may have made our products even better. 	I think it allowed the agencies to better understand the flaws that put our software and devices at risk, from outside interference. 	That‚Äôs just my opinion.
@AngelFoxToday71 @JulianAssange We don‚Äôt want him tortured. That would be counterproductive.
@AngelFoxToday71 @JulianAssange What is thought to be the biggest (most classified) piece of information, his organization has released so far? If you know.
@AngelFoxToday71 @JulianAssange Is he still being held in the E embassy? Or does he get moved around a lot?
@RealOmarNavarro I think we agree on many things.
@RealOmarNavarro I have no money to give. I just think you are the one. Your attitude and positive message is what is needed.

@softawafta @DavidHudson04 @justglad1 @RepMaxineWaters @ABC @abc7carlos @TheDemocrats The story is unfolding. It is said, the flag was flying on a truck or van.

@softawafta @DavidHudson04 @justglad1 @RepMaxineWaters @ABC @abc7carlos @TheDemocrats The ripple in the pond really.
@softawafta @DavidHudson04 @justglad1 @RepMaxineWaters @ABC @abc7carlos @TheDemocrats I agree. I worked in food service for up to 7 years of my life. Just like any business, discrimination based on race, sex, political affiliation, height, is unaffordable. That was a huge mistake on that behalf of that particular establishment. The backlash was probably subtle.
@softawafta @DavidHudson04 @justglad1 @RepMaxineWaters @ABC @abc7carlos @TheDemocrats She totally did. On camera, at one of her public speech things. Then she blamed the president! 	Do you recall when WH press secretary had trouble at a restaurant recently?
@realDonaldTrump @steph93065 Oh! Since like 1920. Check fraud and scams like that was a huge problem. Luckily the Secret Service was put into action. 	Counterfeit currency, bad checks, money laundering, all huge problems.
I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if Stephen King invented writing in the first place. He waited a long time for someone to make him a typewriter to play with. üçï
@softawafta @DavidHudson04 @justglad1 @RepMaxineWaters @ABC @abc7carlos @TheDemocrats Ya know there‚Äôs folks out there that appreciate the land, the flag, and what it represents. They just may not be as forgiving as a person such as myself can be. So when that nerve gets struck, when they catch wind, there‚Äôs only sand in an hourglass. All we can do is, wait and see
@softawafta @DavidHudson04 @justglad1 @RepMaxineWaters @ABC @abc7carlos @TheDemocrats What more of a concern for them? Immediate law enforcement, or things that go bump in the night? 	It should be no secret, that flag burning, while legally tolerated, is not so easily appreciated. But hey, fair warning ya know.
@softawafta @DavidHudson04 @justglad1 @RepMaxineWaters @ABC @abc7carlos @TheDemocrats Ever see Stand By Me? Or maybe even Dreamcatcher? Favs. I think both Stephen King novel adaptations, feature a scene  where the bullies are beating up another kid. 	It‚Äôs a life lesson that‚Äôs for sure. We don‚Äôt make lasting friendships, ganging up on those that can‚Äôt defend.
@softawafta @DavidHudson04 @justglad1 @RepMaxineWaters @ABC @abc7carlos @TheDemocrats I don‚Äôt know if it was stolen or not. If it was, the charged penalty is more severe though. It‚Äôs something for people to think about before doing something like that. Peer pressure, when engaging in a questionable activity like that, often has consequences.
@politicalHEDGE Personally, I don‚Äôt think anyone should be forced to pay for that. Maybe other people agree.
@softawafta @DavidHudson04 @justglad1 @RepMaxineWaters @ABC @abc7carlos @TheDemocrats There‚Äôs all sorts of concerns with that law and how it can be written. 	Basically, everyone is better off not assaulting anyone in general. It‚Äôs already illegal. Why make matters worse? 	It‚Äôs valiant effort though.
@softawafta @DavidHudson04 @justglad1 @RepMaxineWaters @ABC @abc7carlos @TheDemocrats There‚Äôs a new law concerning that very thing in the making. As per - masked assault, during protest.
@connie_ogle @Deplorable80210 They got one too. I forget when. It turned out to be a success.
@softawafta @DavidHudson04 @justglad1 @RepMaxineWaters @ABC @abc7carlos @TheDemocrats If that flag was property of another person or entity, it‚Äôs considered arson. Which is treated as a separate crime.
@CassandraRules @TechQn Yeah, kidnapping, child abduction, sexual assault, rape of a minor - all of which are illegal. Those heterosexual parents will be happy to kill a pedophile.
@softawafta @DavidHudson04 @justglad1 @RepMaxineWaters @ABC @abc7carlos @TheDemocrats Yeah. I‚Äôm going to continue to not burn a flag for no real reason. I appreciate it more. Everyone can freely state their opinion verbally or in writing though. ‚úåÔ∏èüá∫üá∏ü¶á
@softawafta @DavidHudson04 @justglad1 @RepMaxineWaters @ABC @abc7carlos @TheDemocrats If you read further into it, Texas v Johnson case, the Supreme Court voted 5-4 in considering it protected by the 1st amendment. 	Personally, it infuriates me, to see it done like that.
@softawafta @DavidHudson04 @justglad1 @RepMaxineWaters @ABC @abc7carlos @TheDemocrats Unless it‚Äôs a flag retirement ceremony. I‚Äôm doubting that given circumstances.
@softawafta @DavidHudson04 @justglad1 @RepMaxineWaters @ABC @abc7carlos @TheDemocrats https://t.co/G3HhuvV1ww
@softawafta @DavidHudson04 @justglad1 @RepMaxineWaters @ABC @abc7carlos @TheDemocrats I would‚Äôve assumed a law would be in place against doing so. Some places have laws against starting fires in public places without a permit. Also starting fires on or in federal property or buildings is a federal misdemeanor. I would just consider it treason.

@KamalaHarris We need help here. Someday soon.
@RealJamesWoods The pipe fitters union is always hiring. They even offer classes and probably hands-on training.
I‚Äôm struggling to restrict myself to only 3 of these and 5 of those .... I‚Äôm going to think about this and return later.
Oh yeah . It‚Äôs like a hoot nanni. In rain form.
And it‚Äôs about to rain a lot.
@Greg_Hasty @dsdr2011 Yeah that‚Äôs wierd. I hope they work it out, before they make further mistakes.
Jolly good show old man. Jolly good.
@slutsnguts Over here it‚Äôs 3:05 AM. Can you guess what I‚Äôve been thinking about for the past 6 hours?
@FoxNews @Ocasio2018 So she‚Äôs basically saying this is part of a small scale military-type invasion? 	Is she aware of the human trafficking? That arranges armed home robbery? And the rapists? 	We have become aware.
@Marmar69433351 @JDugudichi That‚Äôs cool. Not the end of the world or anything. We have plenty of options to choose from. So the journey goes on.....
@Marmar69433351 @JDugudichi Yeah if people are jumping off cliffs, I‚Äôll just go get a sandwich from Jimmy Johns.
@RealJamesWoods @RepMaxineWaters Would you say they were technically on Federal property? 	Do you know what that means? 	That‚Äôs a felony brother.
@ShazbotZulu @TheScoop_US I saw the word non-binary today, and decided to do a little research. Apparently, the ol Wikipedia has quite a bit to tell me on the subject. 	If I could just summarize my latest learning experience - WTF .
@JDugudichi What, you can‚Äôt swim?
@KamalaHarris Why are people in your state reportedly burning the flag? Is there any particular reason that you can tell me? 	What are your personal thoughts on that? 	Can you explain to me why people on your state burning the flag? 	Are you allowed to respond?
@RealJamesWoods @RepMaxineWaters Uh huh. Soooooooo, what are they trying to say? They wanna go on a boat ride?
Lol - easy money...... that was so cool.
The Nemesis from RE2 Apocalypse (the movie) is like a carbon copy of that terminator. The one chasing Kyle.
I think, Christian Bale ( @TheOfficialBale ) made John Connor so badass in this movie.

@_POTUSTRUMPNEWS Uh oh. Was it documented or a verbal agreement?
Very Superstitious was on earlier around 11:00 AM. I was busy at that time, I was unable to report.
@SunshineTheGrey I can see myself being more efficient and even more pleasant to others throughout the day without this much scrutiny looming over me. 	It should be legal.
@SunshineTheGrey So there‚Äôs no legitimate explanation for its illegality. We can explain crimes like murder, theft, damage to property, constitutional violations, but this falls under the ‚ÄúJust because‚Äù category. 	Fascism doesn‚Äôt work for me.
@FoxNews @bbschumann Textbook epic right there.
@birdman8272 @DartLucy I‚Äôm undecided at this time. Something uncool is/was being allowed for some time. There are elements of traitor-ism there. I think there‚Äôs a problem for sure.
@RealMAGASteve @PatriotsOfMars Wow. How can that be possible without anyone having known? Unless someone did know.... 	Personally I‚Äôd apply for either job. I‚Äôm not adept to deceive you.
I just read so much information while my laundry is in the wash. I‚Äôm like blauhh! Fried. Nap.
@RealJamesWoods It‚Äôs an utterly insane number of people.
@bartmanmarine @intellihubnews Always obtain a warrant first. 	Always have backup on the way. 	Only fools rush in. 	The headlines can make or break. I see what you mean.

@bartmanmarine @intellihubnews Journalism is what rallies support from the people. If someone hears a tree fall in the woods, there should be a definitive explanation for it. 	Otherwise the newspapers will print about who wore what suit and tie. No one will buy the paper. The stock market crashes. Unemployment
@MZHemingway @Diane_1024 A statement like that is basically an attempt to influence an election outcome. 	I am no traitor.
@bartmanmarine @intellihubnews I‚Äôm serious, she can show up at any minute with cameras rolling.
@bartmanmarine @intellihubnews In that case you need a strong minded, independent journalist to get the job done. They call it getting ‚ÄúLoomered‚Äù. I‚Äôve seen it done. Exquisite execution of details.
@bartmanmarine @intellihubnews What‚Äôs her face and that other guy, clearly crossed the line. I.C.E. 		@ICEgov
@intellihubnews @bartmanmarine And having agents in house, not informing the concert promoter across the street of a possible incident in development, probably wasn‚Äôt a good idea. They could have postponed the show. That didn‚Äôt happen though. Instead people died.
@intellihubnews @bartmanmarine And immigration invasions, and political fiascos running rampant. 	People are legit, waiting, with the popcorn.
@intellihubnews @bartmanmarine The FOIA is a beautiful thing. In order for us as a people to feel secure, we need that information released. We need to know for sure if there is a terror element involved, or even a breach of national security and in what form. 	There‚Äôs already tattoos cutting off heads...
@intellihubnews @bartmanmarine They could just put us all on the payroll.
@bartmanmarine @intellihubnews What are some of the main reasons an investigation falls under federal jurisdiction, as opposed to a state, when an occurrence like this does happen?
@bartmanmarine @intellihubnews Okay.
@bartmanmarine @usa_tide Wow yes. That‚Äôs a big deal too.
Zodiac. I‚Äôm a Gemini, but the cast of this movie is epic. Check it out if you can, I‚Äôll elaborate later. ‚úåÔ∏èüá∫üá∏ü¶á
@RonPaul @Brandi_Lou_79 Not fear, but be cautious of, anything. Especially malevolent extraterrestrial beings. Ya know?
This movie is so damn heartbreaking.
@bartmanmarine @usa_tide This information can be subpoenaed in court. MGM wants to file a lawsuit against victims from the concert. The only reason I can think of that it not be released at this time would be a privacy clause of some kind. For safety of individuals or parties excluded from fault.
Charlie Sheen went on to be a superstar. You can see some of the finest of work in movies like Platoon, Hot Shots, Hot Shots part deux. 	Ever hear of Navy Seals?
Uh oh! Another fan favorite..... ever see Howard The Duck? 	Lea Thompson. Amazing woman. Did you know she wrote and performed her own music?
Wow Jennifer Grey also stars in Dirty Dancing, with Patrick Swayze. Intense movie magic!
I found this for $2.99. I‚Äôd like to remember Mr. Swayze and the glorious movie magic he helped create. Then let‚Äôs get down to business. Original - Red Dawn - Blu-ray! Rolling. https://t.co/jsfVVsojSO
I can‚Äôt believe how similar we talk. Maybe I‚Äôve just picked up a few things, I don‚Äôt know. He‚Äôs way more rational than I am that‚Äôs for sure.
@LaylaAlisha11 @RealBamaCowboy There‚Äôs always things like espionage involved. Things like double agents, double crossings, your right who can we trust? 	I think about all the times I‚Äôve seen in movies where the bosses pull a fast one. It‚Äôs crazy.
@LaylaAlisha11 @RealBamaCowboy I have a question. When a federal agent obtains sensitive data, would it be better to disclose said data to the public immediately, or keep said data safe from would be infiltration until the time is right? 	I see pros and cons in both scenarios. 	What do other people think?
@VovkulakaMusic @Tool @Loudwire Awesome. So awesome.
@RealBamaCowboy @ryteouswretch Wow, I thought about this earlier today, and here you are confirming my suspicion. Outstanding. 	Much to do, so much to figure out.....
@Education4Libs @rn_deplorable It‚Äôs not like a part of me doesn‚Äôt want female nudity all in my face all the time, but reality check. That‚Äôs just not the way it is.
@Education4Libs @rn_deplorable Wouldn‚Äôt the transgender man feel more comfortable in the men‚Äôs locker room? And get to see all that hot guy action? 		Men stay out of the women‚Äôs areas because of respect. For privacy and stuff. 	We might drool, thinking about the women, but still maintain that barrier.
@president9111 @realDonaldTrump Every picture I see of her exhibits signs of mania. She seems unaffected by stimuli that would cause remorse to anyone else. 	Has anybody else noticed this?
@homerjay71 @USArmy It seems that this occurs in real life as well. While I‚Äôve never thoroughly played through a Call Of Duty, I‚Äôve acquired some shooting experience. 	Maybe it‚Äôs magic, maybe instinct, but it happens. 	I don‚Äôt think any qualified instructor will recommend doing it though. Still cool
@Bitchy006 @not2far2right Hi. Were you able to file a police report? And notify your banks of stolen bank cards? And your phone company to locate a stolen phone? 	I hope your situation gets resolved.
@bartmanmarine @intellihubnews MGM wishes to withdraw from liability. If we can properly view and understand the radar you are requesting, that would surely help set the record straight.
@bartmanmarine @intellihubnews Can the states attorney general do anything to assist you?
@bartmanmarine @intellihubnews It isn‚Äôt possible to make a request any more well written and thorough than that. 	If the request was denied, then I‚Äôll be thinking things.
And now back to our regularly scheduled program. 		Did I just read that a day care provider hung a child? And was given probation? 		No. Harming a child in this manner is one if the worst things a person can do. 		May she wallow in a lake of fire forever.
Voter registration card received! I‚Äôm gonna rock and roll that poll like you wouldn‚Äôt believe.
All day. Not a drop of coffee. 	Why must I live this way? 		@blckriflecoffee ..... one of these days, I‚Äôm gonna have some cash, and I‚Äôm gonna place an order, and soon after, my suffering will subside. ‚úåÔ∏èüá∫üá∏ü¶á
No you were right, I don‚Äôt personally have proof. I‚Äôm still willing to talk about it though. If you look into a document a little bit, there in-lies the proof. Something happened and knowledge is being shared about it.
@SunshineTheGrey @TheNYevening @cjsienna55 That‚Äôs a shame too. There‚Äôs so much to do that isn‚Äôt oil related. Think of all that goes into agriculture, or a small business in the trades. The textile industry. 	Little effort is put into alternate energy resources. What if the well runs dry?
@hrenee80 @Julia5180 I concur. 		There‚Äôs definitely something going wrong in those two departments that render me unable to fully trust them. Not now at least. Not for many years. I don‚Äôt want to get rid of them completely though. Whatever the problem, we can make it better.
@WorkTheWalk Have you ever witnessed pedophilia or child molestation?
@WorkTheWalk Yeah a sexuality that involves having sex with children. 	What is wrong with you?
@rangerwyld @EW Why do you say treason? 	Who are we at war with? 	What are you being forced to do?
@bartmanmarine @LasVegasCoverUp One thing that‚Äôs really cool though. Intellihub has the flight radar for all the helos. Soooo, we will know where the came from and went. And all the cheese.

@bartmanmarine @LasVegasCoverUp But like we were saying, the room was dressed up in this way. Was the body in there real? Was it even Steven? 	This makes me think there was just guys shooting randomly at the walls and stuff.
@bartmanmarine @LasVegasCoverUp Sure.
@bartmanmarine @LasVegasCoverUp Why would we be ok with them doing that?
@bartmanmarine @LasVegasCoverUp What kind of proof? The only door we know even showing damage is the main entryway.
@LauraLoomer How did you know about the receipt for the cheeseburgers?

@LasVegasCoverUp @bartmanmarine Evidence destroyed, evidence disposed of, falsified evidence, all these things.
@LasVegasCoverUp @bartmanmarine If it was a shooter tucked behind some bushes, how did people in the middle of a crowd get shot? With a downward angle of penetration?	And no hospital has record of a GSW of this type, or at least the amount of them as claimed?
@LasVegasCoverUp @bartmanmarine There is that stock buyout in MGM to think about. And the gun grabbing. And an election in the area.
@LasVegasCoverUp @bartmanmarine If there was a training routine going on, then that‚Äôs what I sat through the whole time. 	But if people in the crowd were shot at and killed by someone else, that‚Äôs what I‚Äôm supposed to be considering right? 	Was it not a highly resourced government ‚Äúpsyop‚Äù ?
@LasVegasCoverUp @bartmanmarine Ok. So recently people were saying the dead body in the room was a fake. I watched a tutorial on making the things. 	So if that‚Äôs true, then nothing was real. There would be no point to any further research or interest, right? 	Unless it doesn‚Äôt mean something else was going on.
@CarolCpmgasser @hickorymtnman And a voice box that says ‚Äúthank you for shooting me‚Äù ‚Äúwould you like to reload?‚Äù
@MAGA_Partisan @hickorymtnman @AshleyW838 That‚Äôs a horrible example to exhibit to civilians. They are really pushing it.
@SavtheRepublic @FireUpMAGAKAG @ThomMAGA I concur. It‚Äôs difficult to trust many people that you are talking about.

@denlusk13 I‚Äôm pretty sure I agree with you. The more I read about the person, more suspicious behavior becomes apparent.
@denlusk13 Ah yes. Now I know who you mean.
@denlusk13 Never heard of the person. Is there more you can tell me?
@FiveRights @MySchimke Maybe things happened. We still need the FBI. They conduct an immense amount of work just to get a fact obtained and prioritized.
@denlusk13 @IPro709 @therealroseanne I usually try to offer some constructive criticism. A good parent would say, if you don‚Äôt have anything good to say.....
@realDonaldTrump @thatcyberchick The FBI dudes committee hearing was a big deal. There‚Äôs nonstop coverage of that. 	Yeah he had a creepy face. Oooh aahhh.
@bartmanmarine @LasVegasCoverUp It pisses me off. I‚Äôm not even available.
@bartmanmarine @LasVegasCoverUp There‚Äôs thousands of people that need to be interviewed.
@bartmanmarine @LasVegasCoverUp Like I told the other guy, a bird can only fly so far before it needs a snack, I did the math. There‚Äôs only 3 possible refueling points. If the books don‚Äôt clear, turn the heat up.
@bartmanmarine @LasVegasCoverUp It‚Äôs not like we can just walk in the place and take an elevator up to clue-ville, right? 	And then look at the gps and pick random aerial view locations to check out next. And wait for those blood tests to clear while eating lunch. Sure there‚Äôs going to be gun fight.
@bartmanmarine @LasVegasCoverUp Of course I‚Äôd love to go check some things out. We probably have to fill out some documentation, get clearance, follow the yellow brick road, and have a field day. There‚Äôs going to be all sorts of nonsense going on. We need a fast car. Many snacks. What else?
I watched your body cam footage. I don‚Äôt think he was reaching for his gun. We may never know what he was doing. Maybe trying to by a beverage or snack. 	That‚Äôs a real nasty situation. I wonder, was he shot and killed? Now there‚Äôs a big mess going on.
@bartmanmarine @LasVegasCoverUp And that shooter is still out there somewhere right?
@RdNkAngel1989 I first watched this movie in an Opera House turned movie theater. One of the best movies. One of my favorites.
