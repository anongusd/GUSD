@SunshineEmpire Was never my intention to jump down anyone‚Äôs throat. Would also never say @CMTommyHazouri is liberal as AOC. He is a moderate. My defense of him comes from personal experience working w/ him over his first term in office. I saw him operate as a democrat &amp; there is proof of that.
@SunshineEmpire @CMTommyHazouri @CMTommyHazouri endorsed Gwen Graham for Governor, while @lennycurry endorsed Gov DeSantis. They obviously have policy differences but still choose to work together on behalf of Jacksonville. Question for you-who on the Council based on their voting record has really opposed MLC?
@SunshineEmpire How is @CMTommyHazouri pretending to be a Dem? He was the only Dem to outwardly support HRO, voted to keep certain Dems on the planning commission, supported John Crescimbeni (DEM) running for Council Pres, who CM Brosche (REP) ran against.  No one else can say that.
