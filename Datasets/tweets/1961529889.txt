@PepinLachance @kurteichenwald I think if you believe what you in the media, then you‚Äôre the sucker. You probably thought Hillary was going to win, just like the left media told you, right? In any case, I care about results and everything Trump is doing should‚Äôve been done long ago.
@PepinLachance @kurteichenwald I agree. That‚Äôs why the duly elected President is fighting hard to represent those of us being harmed the most by the crime and drugs. He gets it and will get us the physical protection for our families. Good that he cares about our safety!

@NotBritt_ish @RashidaTlaib I wanted to mention that I was partly raised in a communist country. This is relevant because I saw how govt professed protections were merely a mean to slowly but surely tighten grip on control. Venz is a recent example and the left in US keeps moving in same direction.
@NotBritt_ish @RashidaTlaib The goals of Made in China 2025 include increasing the Chinese-domestic content of core materials to 40% by 2020 and 70% by 2025. The plan focuses on high-tech fields including the pharmaceutical industry which are presently the purview of foreign companies.
@NotBritt_ish @RashidaTlaib China‚Äôs rise is a direct transfer/theft of wealth due to their unfair trade practices, made worse by protection under WTO. They‚Äôre  pretty much stealing our next generation‚Äôs future, and every president over last two decades has just been on the sidelines watching.
@NotBritt_ish @RashidaTlaib Obviously, the biggest problem is China on tariffs, but you also have to consider their unfair trade practices of state sponsored enterprises, ownership requirement in foreign companies for doing business in China and their criminal intellectual property theft.

@NotBritt_ish @RashidaTlaib Didn‚Äôt mean you bringing my daughter into this. I was referring to govt in general. There‚Äôs only two genders, male and female defined by chromosomes in a person‚Äôs body. We don‚Äôt refer to animals as being transgender. I support freedoms as long as it doesn‚Äôt infringe on other‚Äôs.
@NotBritt_ish @RashidaTlaib Hillary‚Äôs position was that in 9th mth you can rip baby out prior to birth. This was logic of her position on late-term abortion, which is that an abortionist is free to perform abortion at any stage of pregnancy if there is a health reason, including a reason of emotional health
RT @realDonaldTrump: Great new book by Dr. Robert Jeffress, ‚ÄúChoosing the Extraordinary Life.‚Äù Get it and enjoy!  @LouDobbs
@NotBritt_ish @RashidaTlaib Understood but the bigger risk here is my child‚Äôs psychological state of mind and well-being vs a male not feeling feminine enough. He can just pee in the boys stall and carry on with his life. No need to drag my little girl into this.
@NotBritt_ish @RashidaTlaib Understood, but Dems talk out of both sides of mouth. How can you people but are ok ripping apart a baby up to the min before it‚Äôs born. Minimal protection such as provided by constitution is adequate and other. But I‚Äôve also seen how protection quickly turns into control.
@NotBritt_ish @RashidaTlaib Have a good one
@NotBritt_ish @RashidaTlaib Not targeting them and not discriminating either, but I won‚Äôt agree to let a grown man in bathroom with my little girl because he feels like a lady today. It‚Äôs up the communities to decide things of this nature, not federal govt.
@NotBritt_ish @RashidaTlaib Depends what you‚Äôre talking about but there‚Äôs only two genders. I don‚Äôt want my little girl going to the bathroom with an adult male, for example. This is a topic where it‚Äôs up to the states and people in their communities to decide, not federal govt.
@NotBritt_ish @RashidaTlaib On this point, it‚Äôs an ideological difference. Dems believe govt needs to control people‚Äôs lives. Republicans believe in less govt and more freedom. Also, regulations cost the American people with more bureaucracy.
@NotBritt_ish @RashidaTlaib Are you saying that you‚Äôre ok with EU, China, Mexico, Canada and virtually every country in the world charging higher tariffs for USA products there and us charging them near nothing here? Have you seen that nearly everything is made in China because our industry is decimated?
@NotBritt_ish @RashidaTlaib Transgenders are &lt;1% of USA population. Please don‚Äôt tell me that policy for the other over 99% has to bend to the will of the &lt;1%.

@AnalogousSpeak @CaliMamaMAGA @ClayJones41190 @CrimsonBoomer @HarrisonWarming @NomanchezGuey @AOC Most of the pollution is being caused by the developing world, not USA. Have you seen cities in China and India? You should go protest over there. Btw, border security is not just illegal immigration, are you saying pollution is killing more people in USA than drug epidemic?
@AnalogousSpeak @CrimsonBoomer @HarrisonWarming @NomanchezGuey @AOC You‚Äôve been drinking the Koolaid. Everything AOC proposes will cost $40 trillion in 10 yrs, or $4T/yr. Govt total annual tax revenue is $3.3T. How can govt save more than the total it‚Äôs currently bringing in? https://t.co/2eh8axX2RM
@HarrisonWarming @CrimsonBoomer @NomanchezGuey @AOC Tax cuts cost this country? Taxes are revenues not expenses. The govt only spends, it doesn‚Äôt create wealth, so just taking money away from govt saves the country money. Giving govt money to spend increases expenses (costs) for the country.
