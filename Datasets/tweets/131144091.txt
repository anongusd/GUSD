"The US and Argentina share that we are both democracies. The most imp role in a democracy is not being a President, it is being a citizen."
.@POTUS talks on the constraints that world leaders deal with in serving constituents as being as real as the perceived strengths.
Last question: 16 year-old asks why Presidents can't just solve the obvious problems: how to better get along w others, know more of world.
"Each side only remembers its own grief and has a difficult time seeing the other side."
Asked about Israeli-Palestinian conflict: "Despite enormous efforts we've not made the kind of progress I would like to see."
1) private businesses create jobs	2) govs create infrastructure 	3) non profits partner &amp; what's possible thru training and guidance
"Private sector, non profit and government have to work together. Each of these pieces are important."
.@POTUS being asked how social businesses need to evolve by a woman who runs an enterprise to increase civic participation.
ICYMI https://t.co/9lCK8qEWj2
.@POTUS on his biggest achievement: "20M have health care who didn't before." Happy anniversary today ACA!
.@POTUS talking about how information overload and (yes) social media has allowed people to separate from facts. I struggle w that one too.
When you think of the problems he sees. And yet he says today: "the world is far less violent on average than it was 100 years ago" Strong.
"If you look at the trajectory of history, humanity has consistently improved." To me this is the core @POTUS. Relentless optimism.
"In my own family I have the genetic strains of everybody. It gives me confidence that people are essentially the same." -@POTUS
.@POTUS announces the first full class of Young Leaders of the Americas will come to the U.S. this year for mentoring in entrepreneurship.
"Part of my goal is to move past the old debates that have defined this region."-@POTUS

@cece_face Pets definitely produce some of the best tweets
@digiphile I don't think it's a zero sum game. But I fully agree petitions is piece we need to improve and appreciate your advocacy of it.
.@kevinroose I think @USDS is showing that doesn't really need to be an impediment.
.@rk not sure! but we've got one in our office if he needs to borrow it.
.@AlisonLDaniels @macon44 yup! 44 is for the 44th President.
@digiphile I know there's more to do there. I worked on this petition in my first week and I believe in the platform https://t.co/kuvETr02dw
.@digiphile We have more work to do there - it's obviously a place where there is tremendous public engagement.
.@mischa good thought! and I have been to the chili bowl. w/ @emaland @iano @kevinweil and @elizabeth
.@morrisn Havent really felt constrained by the tech per se. I think as opposed to a startup resources are def more constrained here in gov.
@digiphile well it happened before I got here but the net neutrality story is a big one.
@mkramer @18F not sure but @rypan may know
@SpeaksFreely13 well my job is about online engagement so this is a part of it!
.@mkramer @18F so concretely, the talk I did at moveForward(100) was an update on What I've Learned in the first 18 days.
.@digiphile one of the things I've seen is that conversation does inform policy. WH does that all the time IRL - so we need the online piece
.@amynw my first ever selfie stick shot.
@mkramer oh yah for sure - we're starting to do a lot more socializing of what we've learned both within WH and then to agencies.
.@DanielZarick prob how they are more similar than not. there's a lot of stuff happening all the time so the trick is how to stay focused.
.@digiphile on our FB page you'll see a lot more video that's shorter - which is something we talked about when #socialcivics started.
.@mkramer that's part of the reason I'm doing this is just to try to share in less structured, formal ways.
.@jeanninehunter so basically understanding that most people's inclination is to help when asked is the most rewarding part for me.
.@jeanninehunter I really didn't know what to expect when I started asking for help but the responses have been so overwhelming positive.
@jeanninehunter Was stoked to be able to talk at moveForward(100) - there's such a great vibe in the extended digital family.
D'oh! Forgot to .@ some of the replies. But still taking questions so just fire away.
.@BashirDada I'd probably go Green tho if forced.
@BashirDada the Navy Mess has really good coffee so I stick with that.
.@isaach @amac I do! A few times a week. It's a big plus of working here.
@truebe I like about 12-14 but only 5-6 faves. I started with only 1 suit.
@BDriscollJr Hasn't really been a huge problem tbh - I'm using Twitter here at my desk for example. But Blackberry mail was an adjustment.
(After a month the team let me use the selfie stick.)

@jeneps @DylanByers Also, this debate which i recognize i started misses the point by a pretty wide margin
@jeneps @DylanByers In all of his comments on this, he talked about the Chemical Weapons Ban and the international norm
@jeneps @DylanByers Like I said to Dylan, you guys are the arbiter of news, but calling it obama's redline ignores context and history
@DylanByers the important point is that too many make this Obama's redline, when it has been the redline for the world for decades
@DylanByers This isnt intended to be some debate abt what is news. Thatsup to you and @chucktodd not me
