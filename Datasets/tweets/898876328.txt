@rasmansa I agree with your conclusion. However, I also understand how people are reacting that it could have just as easily ended with the death of one or more innocent Black men. And we know how often that has actually happened.The reaction is feeling pain of losing so many in past &amp; now
Nutrition is a key to good health. If you suffer from chronic inflammation (i.e. arthritis,eczema,lupus,diabetes,depression etc) try an anti-inflammation diet.A great starting point is to eliminate wheat from eating plan - it has gluten (which most African Americans can't digest)
