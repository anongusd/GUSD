ICYMI from @RepBenMcAdams in @USATODAY: Our mandate is to be thoughtful and moderate. Fiscal responsibility must anchor our policies, and we must act in a way that builds bipartisan support. This is what our constituents asked us to do. https://t.co/qRfrzna5ez
Hey @JeffFlake, for the record, there are 27 of us in Congress today. We gained 10 freshman members who helped deliver the Democratic majority and we’re already getting Washington working again. #BlueDogsAreBack 👋🏾👋🏽👋🏼👋🏻👋 Here are more stats on us today: https://t.co/bMQzfII1mu https://t.co/Dh4R4Jqtqu
ICYMI: We’ve announced our policy agenda. Our task forces will lead the way to deliver bipartisan solutions in these issue areas:  		✅ Infrastructure	✅ Job Creation	✅ Fiscal Responsibility	✅ Government Reform	✅ National Security	✅ Rural Opportunity 		https://t.co/KT36C7xd5H
In @USATODAY, @RepBenMcAdams, Co-Chair of our Task Force on Fiscal Responsibility &amp; Gov’t Reform writes: “Our mandate is to be thoughtful and moderate. Fiscal responsibility must anchor our policies, &amp; we must act in a way that builds bipartisan support.” https://t.co/qRfrzna5ez

@RepTorresSmall and @RepSpanberger will lead the Task Force on Rural Opportunity, which will primarily focus on addressing the inequality of opportunity between rural and urban America.
@RepKendraHorn and @CongressmanJVD will lead the Task Force on National Security, which will proactively engage on issues that promote a strong and smart national security for the United States. The group will pursue policies that better protect the American people.
@RepBenMcAdams and @RepEdCase will lead the Task Force on Fiscal Responsibility and Government Reform, which is charged with building on the Blue Dog Coalition’s recognized leadership in addressing our nation’s fiscal challenges and enhancing good governance.
@RepCunningham and @RepSherrill will lead the Task Force on Infrastructure and Job Creation, which will primarily focus on delivering a 21st-century infrastructure to all corners of the country and a creating a positive economic climate geared toward boosting economic growth.
NEWS: We're proud to announce the Blue Dog Coalition's agenda for the 116th Congress. Under the leadership of our policy task force co-chairs, we will work tirelessly to pursue bipartisan solutions that can be implemented now and move our country forward. https://t.co/yOM0xiLBAz https://t.co/AerEcZ5HIT
Our members have changed over the years—but our mission is the same. The Blue Dogs remain focused on bipartisanship, fiscal responsibility, &amp; national security. We’re proud to have members like @RepSherrill fighting to update our nation’s infrastructure. https://t.co/hmKiuWuMPZ
As Blue Dogs, we will continue to work with both parties to find common ground and to ensure the American people never see another government shutdown again—we hope the President will do the same. 4/4
The President should never again harm working families, our economy, and our national security, by forcing a government shutdown in an attempt to get his way. 3/4
In this era of divided government, we must work in a bipartisan way to address this country’s challenges, and Blue Dogs commend both sides for reaching a commonsense compromise that allows us to move past this crisis. 2/4
The bipartisan border security deal is not perfect, but it reflects the needs of the American people, which are securing our borders and ports and keeping the federal government open. 1/4
We're proud that @repjimcooper, an expert in fiscal &amp; budgetary policy &amp; tireless advocate for good governance, has been appointed to @HouseBudgetDems. Americans deserve a responsible budget process, and we’re confident @repjimcooper and @HouseBudgetDems will deliver on that. https://t.co/NcZclHU7PC
This level of debt is unacceptable. Because Republicans have been completely irresponsible, it's more necessary than ever that Democrats embrace fiscal discipline. Now is the time for us to uphold our promise of responsible governance, including fiscal responsibility. https://t.co/uFvGowK6Ql

#AbramsAddress on bipartisanship: “We may come from different sides of the political aisle; but, our joint commitment to the ideals of this nation cannot be negotiable.”		Thanks, Stacey Abrams, for showing there’s more to unite us as Americans than divide the political parties.🇺🇸
Our constituents are counting on us to break the gridlock and get things done, and the Blue Dogs will lead the way. #SOTU 4/4
It will require bipartisan consensus to rebuild our nation’s infrastructure, create good-paying jobs, lower the cost of health care, bring down our nation’s ever-growing debt, and ensure Americans never see another government shutdown again. #SOTU 3/4
The President, along with Democrats and Republicans in Congress, can and must find common ground to address the issues our country is facing. #SOTU 2/4
In order for President Trump’s call for bipartisanship to be genuine, he must take concrete action to unite the country. In the era of divided government, bipartisanship is the only way we’ll be able to get anything done. The alternative is endless political gridlock. #SOTU 1/4

The concept of PAYGO is simple: Congress needs to pay for things. It prevents us from forcing our children and grandchildren to bear the burden of paying for the programs we like today. The least we can do to prevent our debt from getting worse is to abide by these rules.
NEWS: The House just passed a measure to restore the bipartisan PAYGO rules. Restoring these rules is the right thing to do to ensure that our nation does not go more deeply into debt and our children and grandchildren are not saddled with this burden for generations to come. https://t.co/3O5AthDCb9
Good. We're ready to get to work for the American people in the #116thCongress. https://t.co/navN6n2uPo
Due to the shutdown, those who are keeping us safe over the holidays are now forced to work without pay. 		That includes:     	54,000 Customs &amp; Border Protection agents &amp; customs officers	53,000 TSA employees	42,000 Coast Guard employees	13,709 FBI agents		That's unacceptable. https://t.co/O8LIGI0aF8
President Trump’s decision to derail a bipartisan effort to prevent a shutdown has now forced over 800k Americans to go without a paycheck over the holidays. Threatening and actively seeking to shut down the government is wrong. We must work together to get out of this mess.
This isn't governance. It's an embarrassment. That’s why we've backed key budgetary reforms, including the No Budget, No Pay Act, which would halt paychecks for all House and Senate members if they miss annual deadlines for budget &amp; appropriations bills. https://t.co/7s4LoLI4xh https://t.co/anR3mxgl3U
The budget process in Washington is broken. Each year, Congress has an Oct. 1 deadline to enact all of its full-year funding bills. Just like Christmas day, this date never changes. Yet, Congress has enacted all of its appropriations bills on time only twice in the past 26 years.
The most basic job of Congress &amp; the President is to work together to fund the government. If Congress passes a bill to keep the government open, it’s up to the President to sign the bill &amp; keep the lights on. This self-inflicted chaos is simply inexcusable. https://t.co/4YWK1Ywasz

America is on a fiscally-unsustainable path. As a result, our debt is the largest it’s ever been at over $21.5 trillion.

To be clear: Under @HouseGOP leadership, a deficit-financed tax bill was passed on a party-line vote that will add $1.9 trillion to the deficit. Since Christmas, a GOP Congress &amp; White House has added $2 trillion to the debt. We must put politics aside &amp; be fiscally responsible. https://t.co/9psji0hBQU
Republicans and Democrats must put partisan politics aside and address the national debt in a balanced, bipartisan way. As Blue Dogs, we’ll continue to fight for this, because the American people simply deserve better. END/
In fact, the Blue Dogs released a set of principles to provide a roadmap that shows how Republicans and Democrats could come together to produce bipartisan, fiscally-responsible tax reform that stimulates economic growth. https://t.co/jWXkX8vv5q
Let's be honest with the American people: The tax debate doesn't have to be unilateral and it doesn't have to be partisan.
As a result, the national debt is now more than $21 trillion, and it continues to increase at an alarming rate. Every American man, woman, and child, holds a share of about $64,423.
Under GOP leadership, we’ve seen a deficit-financed tax bill passed on a party-line vote that will add $1.9 trillion to the deficit over the next 10 years. Since Christmas alone, a Republican-led Congress &amp; White House has added $2 trillion to the debt. https://t.co/XYCER8kPJ3
Just last month, @USCBO warned that the federal debt held by the public will approach 100 percent of GDP within the next 10 years and 152 percent of GDP  by 2048—far surpassing any amount of debt our country has ever held. https://t.co/3PdXPsiPiA

For a Republican framework, there isn’t anything conservative about ‘Tax Reform 2.0’—particularly because it will pass on an even higher amount of debt to our children and grandchildren than we have ever seen as a nation.

The Blue Dogs have a long history of standing for fiscal responsibility—even when it was hard. That's why we backed @RepStephMurphy's balanced budget amendment—because Congress needs to walk the walk when it comes to fiscal discipline. https://t.co/irJOpw3DdH
But it doesn’t have to be this way. We can be fiscally  responsible—and we must be—for future generations. If we want to protect Social Security, Medicare, &amp; other vital programs, we must legally require that we balance our budget in a responsible way.
These projections show an outrageous and unacceptable amount of debt—and we have it because of irresponsible governing and a lack of political courage. Sadly, this Republican-led Congress and White House chose to continue down a fiscally-unsustainable path. https://t.co/unSbQNgScE
By playing partisan politics with district lines, we are making it harder to elect those who will work together to get things done. Gerrymandering isn't good governance. Districts should reflect the desires of the American people -- not political parties. https://t.co/ZudgTaw6t8 https://t.co/iMWutrgLjJ
Future generations are counting on us to get our nation’s fiscal house in order &amp; put our country on the path to economic prosperity. We stand ready to roll up our sleeves, reach across the aisle to get this done, and give Americans the responsible governance they need &amp; deserve.
The GOP tax law’s fiscal irresponsibility poses a threat to the long-term fiscal health of our nation. That's why Dems worked to enact statutory PAYGO in 2010, &amp; Blue Dogs were key advocates for PAYGO. It was the right thing to do to ensure we didn’t go more deeply into debt.
Since Christmas alone, a Republican-led Congress and White House has added $2 trillion to our nation’s debt.
Republicans have let the bipartisan PAYGO expire since they took over the majority.
For eight years, under President Obama, we heard Republicans sound the alarm on our nation’s fiscal state. But now that Republicans are in power of Washington, those alarms on fiscal discipline are silent at a time when our national debt has reached an unprecedented amount.
In 2010, the Blue Dog Coalition and Democratic Leadership restored the PAYGO rules to ensure the government does not spend beyond its means. These bipartisan rules brought back budget surpluses in the 1990s.
The concept of PAYGO is simple. Congress needs to pay for things.
Today, the debt is over $21 trillion, an unprecedented level. By 2023, the U.S. will have to spend more on interest payments on debt than it will on the military. We are glad to see that Dem leadership has pledged to uphold a key Blue Dog principle, PAYGO. https://t.co/aG58zQDSz9

3) The perception of our economic weakness to other countries #FaceTheFacts #BringDownTheDebt
These risks include: 1) Increased interest rates to finance the U.S. debt, 2) Reduced spending on investments at home &amp; abroad #FaceTheFacts
Last year, @RichardHaass called the mounting debt of the U.S. a “slow motion crisis” &amp; identified several strategic risks. #BringDownTheDebt

Interest on debt will be the fastest growing part of fed budget in the next 10 yrs. Meaning less money to invest in defense. #FaceTheFacts https://t.co/3xt6buIkr1
Our nation’s fiscal health &amp; our nat'l security are inextricably intertwined, &amp; we must take action against this growing threat.
Unsustainable fiscal deficits restrict &amp; weaken our hand when dealing w/ virtually all of serious global challenges. #BringDownTheDebt
Our growing nat'l debt threatens U.S. leadership—our ability to adequately achieve our global objectives &amp; protect our national interest.
We're facing more complex threats &amp; challenges around the world–&amp; leadership from the U.S. has never been more important. #BringDownTheDebt
We must #BringDownTheDebt to ensure we have a strong national security and national defense apparatus.

@USCBO Thank you for following today's tweet series on why we must #FaceTheFacts and #BringDownTheDebt
@USCBO That's why for over 20 years, Blue Dogs have called for bipartisan solutions to put our nation on the path to fiscal sustainability.
According to @USCBO, if we #BringDownTheDebt the economy will grow by nearly 6% by 2047, &amp; Americans will have more money in their pockets.
We must #BringDownTheDebt to reduce these burdensome costs for middle-class families. #FaceTheFacts
That means Americans will have to make higher interest payments on mortgages, car loans, student loans, and credit card debt. #FaceTheFacts
If we don’t #BringDownTheDebt, American families will pay more on interest when they borrow money.
If we don't #BringDownTheDebt, by 2030, Americans will make $1,000 less in annual income. In 2047, Americans will make $5,000 less per year.
If we don’t #BringDownTheDebt, Americans will lose $55,000 in total income over the next 30 years. #FaceTheFacts
If we don’t #BringDownTheDebt, Americans will also see lower incomes. #FaceTheFacts
If we don’t #BringDownTheDebt, Americans will see fewer job opportunities because of diminished private investment. #FaceTheFacts
Every single American will feel the negative effects of an increasing national debt. #FaceTheFacts #BringDownTheDebt https://t.co/pTpBG9QFv7
Today, nat'l debt is 77% of GDP. On the current path, the nat'l debt will exceed the size of our economy in less than 20 yrs. #FaceTheFacts

Thanks for following our conversation today about why we need to #FaceTheFacts and #BringDownTheDebt.
That’s why we endorsed the Taxpayers’ Right-to-Know Act, so we can eliminate wasteful spending to help #BringDownTheDebt
Additionally, we must hold agencies accountable on how they spend taxpayer dollars &amp; identify duplicative programs. #BringDownTheDebt
It wasn’t a coincidence, &amp; we want No Budget, No Pay to be permanent – not temporary. Congress must #FaceTheFacts &amp; hold itself accountable.
In 2013, Congress passed a year-long version of No Budget, No Pay. That year, both House &amp; Senate passed budgets for the 1st time in 4 yrs.
That’s why we've endorsed @repjimcooper's No Budget, No Pay Act. Bc Congress needs to get its act together. See facts from @repjimcooper: https://t.co/uDptpwzAut
If Congress doesn’t pass its budget and appropriations on time each year, then Congress shouldn’t get paid.
We must govern responsibly, do our jobs on time, and work to #BringDownTheDebt in a balanced, bipartisan way.
In order to #BringDownTheDebt we must produce bipartisan budgets that are based on real numbers.
That budget includes wishful savings based on legislation that hasn’t passed Congress. In other words, it includes gimmicks. #FaceTheFacts
This year, we’ve seen a budget developed behind closed doors in a partisan way &amp; delivered 93 days after it should have been completed. https://t.co/u2MP9tjX1F

Increasing nat'l debt constrains our military’s capability to respond to unforeseen nat'l security events. #FaceTheFacts #BringDownTheDebt
