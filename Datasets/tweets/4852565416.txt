@NickSzabo4 As long as we run commonplace hardware it seems nearly uncrackable. That is, no actor could destroy the multi-trillion dollar IT industry by banning PC components, too much pushback from biz and consumers. With more exotic hardware, more easily targeted, less trustless.
@NickSzabo4 So we want the input be as simple and discrete as flipping a switch (nothing to reverse engineer or game), ie computing a nonce. But can the problem not pop out into the hardware world, eg controlling hardware supply or cheap energy access?
@NickSzabo4 This is the reason for schelling points / focal points, no? I.e. a way to solve for infinite coordination costs. Proof of Stake can become infinitely complex whereas Proof of Work is less prone to complexity, are you alluding to this?
@NickSzabo4 Generalized platforms must improve at making infinite decisions, whereas bitcoin must improve at making one decision. That's the idea, right?
