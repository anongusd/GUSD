@ChrisJZullo @realDonaldTrump #TraitorInChief &amp; McConnell are the only 2 ppl who can fix this. But McConnell refuses to bring him any of the bills which have been passed, for govt opening &amp; ensuring back pay for feds, to be signed. The House has done &amp; continues to do their job. Now Senate must do theirs.
@ChrisJZullo @realDonaldTrump There is a larger agenda working here, folks. The wall discussion is a smoke screen to distract us. #TraitorInChief is dismantling our govt, our democracy, with #TrumpsShutdown. The GOP didn't want "the wall" either, which is why nothing got down for 2 yrs of GOP control.
