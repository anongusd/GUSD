@realDonaldTrump It‚Äôs spelled racists.  Off to the racists.
@LindseyGrahamSC A CR wasn‚Äôt ok today but it is tonight?
@SenThomTillis @USCG But you failed to vote for a temporary resolution today.  If you genuinely cared, you‚Äôd have voted yes.  I won‚Äôt forget this in 2020.
@SenJohnKennedy @USCG Thanks @SenSchumer for standing strong.  It‚Äôs not an enviable position but it‚Äôs for the right reasons.  The Coast Guard families need to never be pens again.
@SenJohnThune @POTUS Coast Guard families don‚Äôt want to be pawns.  Reopen the government and then negotiate.  Stop hurting us for your political gain.  If you truly care about us, you‚Äôll vote to temporarily reopen while you negotiate.
@moblum @SenTedCruz @USSenate @uscoastguard @SenSchumer Coast Guard families don‚Äôt want to be pawns.  Reopen the government and then negotiate.  Stop hurting us for your political gain.  If you truly care about us, you‚Äôll vote to temporarily reopen while you negotiate.
@SenTedCruz @SenDanSullivan @USCG Reopen the government!
@SenTedCruz @SenJohnKennedy @USCG @SenSchumer @POTUS Stop pretending you care about us.  You have made pawns of real families.  Shame on you.  Vote to open the government and then negotiate!
@SpeakerPelosi @realDonaldTrump @SenateGOP Don‚Äôt give up.  As a CG family, we are tired of being pawns.  If he gets his way this time, we‚Äôll be here again. Stay strong @SpeakerPelosi.
@SenJohnKennedy @USCG Thank you.  I hope you‚Äôll also vote to the temporary reopening of the government today so that we can get back pay while y‚Äôall negotiate.  Please.
@SenRickScott @SenSchumer @USCG Can we count on you to vote on both bills today?
@SenThomTillis Thanks for nothing.  You are letting down so many North Carolinians.

@RoyBlunt Actually, wanting the government to reopen before negotiating does a lot of good for federal workers.  You guys are kidding yourselves if you think this is working for you.  The tide is turning and it‚Äôs your own fault.
@JohnCornyn @WSJ Then open the government.
@realDonaldTrump @SteveHiltonx ‚ò†Ô∏èüòÇüòÇüòÇ
@realDonaldTrump Newsflash.  My husband was a patriot before you kept his paycheck from him.  You claim to be about the military, yet you are starving the Coast Guard.  You‚Äôre a failure.  Reopen the government.
@PressSec @realDonaldTrump #Resist
@SenRickScott @SenSchumer Pretty sure that‚Äôs not how this works.  #WheresMitch
@SenThomTillis What about the Coast Guard?
@SecNielsen @USCG @WhiteHouse Still waiting.
@senatemajldr You are the obstructionist.  The American people aren‚Äôt buying what you‚Äôre selling.
@senatemajldr You‚Äôre a joke.
@senatemajldr Your legacy will be as an obstructionist who sold his sole to a criminal.
@RepDavidRouzer @WWAY How do you live with yourself?
@JohnCornyn Shame on you.
@lisamurkowski As a Coast Guard spouse and former constituent, I thank you.  Our government needs more people like you serving.
@RepDavidRouzer The Coast Guard, who consistently seizes drugs AND repatriates migrants is not being funded.  If you don‚Äôt care about the Coast Guard you don‚Äôt truly care about the safety of our country.
@RepDavidRouzer You are failing the Coast Guard families in your district.  Nearly one million unpaid Americans is a humanitarian crisis.
@senatemajldr You have no soul.
@ChuckGrassley End the shutdown!!
@marcorubio 800,000 Americans aren‚Äôt being paid by the government that employs them.  Get a grip. #EndTheShutdown
@SenThomTillis @ChrisCoons @LindseyGrahamSC @CoryBooker Thank you.  Now #EndTheShutdown
@realDonaldTrump #EndTheShutdown
@SenThomTillis I‚Äôm sure she‚Äôd be proud of the way you‚Äôre working to #EndTheShutdown . Oh..wait. I can‚Äôt wait to vote you out.
@shaunking @AprilDRyan We‚Äôre a Coast Guard family.  A border wall will not pay our mortgage.  #EndTheShutdown
@SenatorBurr I wish I believed that. I‚Äôm a NC resident who‚Äôs family will not receive income until the shutdown ends. Do something.  What are you telling me, my husband, and my children? They have spent months away from their dad while he deploys with CG. We‚Äôre worthless.
