Why do these pictures and nicknames matter?  It could show a glimpse into his heart and or potential bias on issues that need his input.  Two yearbooks with racial controversy, during his adult years is not a coincidence!
Virginia's governor now says it wasn't me!  However, last night he acknowledge one of the characters,  blackface or klansman was him.  He needs to also explain the other yearbook pic where his nickname was Coonman!  Two yearbooks can't be explained away.  Resign!
@hollyrpeete @RevJJackson The governor originally said one of those figures (klansman or blackface) was him and he did not tell us which one.

@Hollyhill_17 Look at my tweets. I did.  The Black Hebrew Israelites created an environment of hate and their words were vile.  Now the kids did not help the situation. They mocked the Native American Elder and would not let him walk.
This video is terrible https://t.co/j8zDC8KJb1
It was a growing hostile environment.   That is true. If the Native American elder was not mocked and allowed to walk through we would not be having this discussion.
I don‚Äôt agree w/the nasty words of the Black Hebrew Israelites. Their words stirred up flash points of racist hostility.  As for the standoff between that 18 year old &amp; the Native American Elder, respect should have been utilized. We must all learn to civilly work through this.
