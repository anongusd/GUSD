@thehill Good information to know that he has been associating with these people. Who else is he hanging out with?
@chrislhayes They are all #liars. What a pathetic waste. They had an opportunity to contribute to society and all they've done is lie, cheat, and steal. And destroy the Republican Party. 	History will not be kind to the Trumps. And they have no one to blame but themselves.	#TrumpCrimeFamily
@tonyschwartz Sadly I know people that support this disgusting person. I have lifelong friends and family members who support him. I'm amazed that I have known them all my life, and yet I don't really know them at all. I'm conflicted because these are people I love - but no longer admire.

@ExportedFromMI That's a very personal decision. It depends on how sincere they are. But given the fact that they would support such a vile, repugnant, evil being you've got to ask yourself if they are capable of even being sincere or asking for forgiveness.

@CillizzaCNN Yep - the Trump game. Lie, deny, duck, run, hide, blame, repeat. He's a con-man who has spent his entire life covering up his crimes and blaming others when caught. C'mon, this is Trump 101 stuff. #Liar #DonTheCon #TrumpLies #TrumpCrimes #BlameGame
@ABC This is the result of one's own words and actions coming back to haunt them. Donald Trump cannot face the fact that he's a lying con-man that is under investigation by his own doing. So naturally he's looking for someone to blame. That's what he does, it's who he is - a #fraud.

@arlenparsa @VeepHBO Pawahaha! This sums up his entire "presidency". An awkward, little man, without a plan.
@NaphiSoc So much to love about this story. We've all watched and waited for these criminals to be brought to justice and with our patience we are reminded, that #Justice will always win out in the end.
@TPM He's always envied John @SenJohnMcCain because he's everything Trump will never be. Senator McCain was a good and decent patriot and an American war hero. He was a well-respected, public servant that has a special place in history. And Trump is a weak, lying fraud. #envy
@washingtonpost Again, it's the truth. He is the shining example of the proclamation of someone that "can't handle the truth". He's terrified of being exposed for the lying criminal that he really is and the internet is the vehicle that brings the truth to the masses. He's living in fear.
@washingtonpost In essence he's trying to cover up the truth. His own words and actions are coming back to haunt him and that's the TRUTH. The one thing he fears the most. This is a man that has spent his entire life trying to cover up the truth. He's terrified.
@Eugene_Robinson He's reading the truth. And the truth that he's a #liar, a #traitor, and a #criminal appears for all the world to see. So we're right back to the core of what Trump fears - the truth. Because the truth is what exposes him and he's fought his entire life to cover it up.

@StevieVonBron @Pappiness Well, I disagree about him being generous. He doesn't donate to charity, even after he's pledged. He stiffs his workers and investors. He bails with bankruptcies, 6 times so far.
@StevieVonBron @Pappiness First, I appreciate the debate. Text can be a hurdle at times.	He's made racist statements for decades. He's escalated that since taking office. From NY former tenants, central park 5, birther, and into the past 3 years.

@kylegriffin1 This is Trump's way of reassuring Putin that he doesn't believe he was involved in meddling in the election. He's clearly beholden to Putin because he has the goods financially, personally, and politically on Trump and America is a bargaining chip. And the GOP is doing nothing.
@robreiner The list is long and grows almost daily - his crimes. We watch them, we hear them, we live with them. The question becomes why are they not only allowed to continue, but in some cases condoned? The #GOP must be held accountable because a lot of this could be avoided. #enough

@funder Putin and GOP gerrymandering is the reason Trump was able to hijack the Oval Office. Any and all rulings/laws with Trump's fingerprints on them must be overturned, including Gorsuch. We are in uncharted territory and this calls for unprecedented actions to correct the crimes.

@mjfree Except that he wasn't actually elected. We are in uncharted territory here. This will be proven to be a stolen election, so all of the actions he's perpetrated against Americans will be illegal. His crimes and lies are catching up with him. Hold him #accountable. #CallHimOut
@NYDailyNews The white house just had a job fair....or there's always Papa John's.
@ConcernedAmeri2 @krassenstein Manafort joined the campaign on 3/29/16. That's been confirmed. He left on 8/19/16. That's confirmed. He purchased an apt in Trump Tower in 2006 for over $3mil. That's confirmed. So, ConAm, your BS is as bad as Trump's.
@Arrow252525 @Glsgwgrl @krassenstein Everyone associated with Trump is on Mueller's radar. And the Trump administration is up to their eyeballs which is why they remain complicit and silent.
@essenviews Of course he is. One less checks and balances system to monitor his crimes and lies. The pattern is clear, he's as transparent as they come - Eliminate anyone with opposing power, so he's the last one standing. Standard Trump, AND he'll keep lying as long as we let him.
@MotherJones This guy has got to be the worst attorney anyone could have nightmares about. He says all the wrong things, publicly and this latest comment is bordering on obstruction. Personally, I hope he keeps ranting, because when it's all over, the dirt on Rudy will come to light.
@Newsweek @POTUS44 has gracefully stepped out of the public arena into private life, as he should. This sh*tshow is Trump's train wreck. And the Democrats have other options besides former presidents because quite frankly, the midterms and the 2020 election is going to depend on fairness.
@TPM And he's jeopardizing his own freedom by hinting at an act that can be considered obstruction. Trump really does sound himself with the best people...but it's just his touch, his feel; you know.

And Steve Bannon, Scott Pruitt, Rex Tillerson, Rudy Guiliani, and Jared Kushner. Trump's corruption attracts the underbelly of society.

He has the opportunity to actually help people so that his legacy will not be one of complete failure.
@thinkprogress The message is clear - destroy the constitution, strip everyone of their rights, and beat them into submission. This will continue as long as we allow it to. The complicit #GOP is doing nothing to stop the assault on our democracy. #Enough	#DrainTheSwamp #VoteThemOut
@Top_Sergeant @Aponte7Mary Exactly. The 2016  presidential election was rigged and illegitimate; therefore we do not currently have a sitting president. Everything he has said and done while he's been occupying the WH is illegal and his actions must be reversed. We have no choice but to re-vote.
@kostka_chris Adorable! Thank you for sharing and giving us all a smile in these troubled times. This is what it's all about!
@NBCNews Every single person in this country has just been put on high alert! Yes, that includes the #GOP. We are all at risk as long as this man is allowed to remain in the WH. Get this diseased, corrupt, incompetent, illegitimate man out of our lives! #Enough #DoSomething

An excellent read. https://t.co/xM03glytyZ
@SenWhitehouse It's amazing to watch people jeopardize their reputations and commit career suicide for someone that couldn't care less about our country or other people's lives. His entire life has been spent chasing women and seeing what he can get away with. And then denying it all.
@mattyglesias @shareitarie10 And consistency matters.
@thinkprogress Lesley Stahl has, in one fell swoop, put all of Trump's lies in context - he wants to discredit and demean so that when they write about him, no one will believe it.  	#TrumpLiar
@Shareblue He's ALWAYS lying. It's #WhatTheyDo.
@LordDonShadow @realDonaldTrump This is more like something he wrote and I'm not sure he even wrote this! https://t.co/4BKJeq7Rn8
@LordDonShadow For a while he was trying to claim he wrote the book. Tony set him straight pretty quickly with that one ü§£
@LordDonShadow He's the easiest person on the planet to figure out. Everything he says is the opposite of the truth. For years he has said "I'm really smart" "I'm really rich" "I know the best people" "I make the best deals" "You'll be sick of winning" "I'm the least racist person"....#Liar

@goodoldcatchy He's a very strange man. There's something unsettling about him. A negativity vibe and a weirdness that is rather jarring.
@RoseAnneBennet2 @tonyschwartz I think we all are. But our country was built by strong people that believed in democracy and it will not fall because of the likes of someone like #DonTheCon #Trump. We are stronger than that. We'll survive this and be a lot wiser when it's over.

@tonyschwartz Tony, unfortunately I think you're right. We all know he'll stop at nothing to keep the mask on and he's certainly aware that he's dangerously close to being exposed for what he really is. I do believe that he'll be brought to #justice along with the rest of the #TrumpCrimeFamily

@Shareblue She's on something. Seriously.
@RedTRaccoon I agree. I'm surprised it hasn't happened already. His irresponsible and reckless deals are spread all over the globe. He has no idea who he's dealing with, nor does he care. Yet. But he will, oh yes - he will when they start talking.
@robreiner @DanielHarperJr1 At this point I think the "evangelicals" would excuse him of raping a woman on live TV. I don't think they give rat's ass what he does unless he messes with their arsenals or their money. Period.
@thinkprogress And there next to him is the deadbeat himself. He's refused payment for services rendered for decades, settles for pennies on the dollar. Most corrupt administration in US history.
@RedTRaccoon Yes, it's a lie. And she is either afraid to speak the truth because we all know that Trump is a bully and attacks anyone that speaks out against him OR she is incompetent and must #resign. This is more evidence of corruption in the Trump administration.
@Shareblue There's something deeply unsettling about this man. He has a very negative presence. Easy to see why he's associated with Trump.
