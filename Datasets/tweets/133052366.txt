#Trump: Crisis threatens safety of our country and thousands of American lives. Gangs like MS-13 and traffickers are violating American laws and terrorizing innocent communities.//What do you think of using a border wall to fight this? Do you feel this is an overwhelming threat?
#Trump: Our proposed structures will be in predetermined, high-risk areas. No border control will work without barriers.//Do you think more walls are needed to control the border?  Should we invest more in technology instead?
#Trump: Walls "keep drugs out and dramatically increase efficiency by allowing us to patrol far larger areas with far fewer people. ... The walls we are building are not medieval walls. They are smart walls." What do you think? Good solution? Do you support this wall?

The networks would have been better off if they'd had the backbone to deny Trump air time for his pointless border wall spiel that won't change minds, say USA TODAY Opinion editors @DavidMastio and @JillDLawrence. https://t.co/pe1K7WBkPs
#Trump's border claims once again overplay his hand on #immigration #Ourview: #NancyPelosi and #CharlesSchumer also broke no new ground and gave no indication that a compromise is in the works to end the #shutdown. #borderwall https://t.co/CRwH7HPICe
Did you watch #Schumer and #Pelosi? #Trump? What grade would you give each of them and why? Who won tonight? Did anyone change your view? Share your thoughts. Use #tellusatoday. #immigration, #borderwall
#Schumer: "The symbol of America should be the Statue of Liberty, not a 30-foot wall. ... End this shutdown now!" #immigration, #borderwall What do you think of the shutdown? Worth the job losses?
#Schumer: Democrats and the president both want a stronger border. We disagree about the best way to do it. "There is no excuse for hurting millions of Americans over a policy dispute." What do you think? Is this a manufactured crisis? Is shutdown necessary? #borderwall
#Pelosi: "The fact is, women and children at the border are not a threat. ... Trump must stop manufacturing a crisis and must re-open the government." #borderwall, #immigration Thoughts? Do you agree? Are the women and children at the border a threat?
#Pelosi: "President Trump ... has chosen to withhold the paychecks for many innocent Americans across the country. Many of them veterans. ... We can install new technology to scan cars and trucks for drugs coming into our nation." Would this tech be better? #borderwall
#Pelosi: "Much of what we've heard from Trump has been full of misinformation. ... The president has chosen ... fear." Thoughts? #borderwall
What did you think of #Trump's speech about the #borderwall and #illegalimmigration? Accurate? Exaggeration? Do you think funding is worth it? Will the wall, as the president said, "pay for itself"?
#Trump: "Over the years I have met with dozens of families whose loved ones were stolen by illegal immigration. ... How much more American blood must we shed before Congress does its job? ... To every citizen: Call Congress and tell them ... to secure our border." Thoughts?
#Trump: Have requested money for a steel barrier instead of a concrete wall. #Borderwall would quickly pay for itself. Democrats in Congress have refused to acknowledge this crisis.//Do you agree? Money worth it? Would it pay for itself? Thoughts on actions by Democrats?
#Trump: Our proposal was developed by law enforcement professionals and professionals at the border.  Includes cutting edge technology for detecting drugs, weapons and illegal contraband.  We have requested more agents and immigration judges.//Workable?
#Trump: Thousands of Americans have been brutally killed by those who have entered and more will be killed if we don't act now. "I am determined to end" cycle of human suffering.//Do you feel like America is under threat? Or is this overblown? #borderwall, #immigration
#Trump: There is a growing crisis at our southern border. "All Americans are hurt by uncontrolled illegal migration. ... Among those hardest hit are African Americans and Hispanic Americans." Thoughts? Accurate or alarmist? #borderwall, #immigration

#Trump: Today's meeting is only the beginning of a longer process. #Putin, I want to thank you again for joining me in these important discussions and advancing open dialogue between Russia and the U.S. This was a very constructive day, few hours that we spent together.
#Trump: As we discussed at length, the crisis in #Syria is a complex one. Cooperation between U.S. and Russia has the potential to save hundreds of thousands of lives. #Helsinki
#Trump: I addressed the issue of #Russian interference in our election. We spent a great deal of time talking about it. #Putin may want to address it very strongly. He has a lot of ideas on this.//Is that enough? Should Trump address this more? #2016elections
#Trump: Our relationship has never been worse than it is now. But "believe me" that changed a few hours ago.//What do you think of that statement?  Believable? Do you believe in Trump's ability to repair relationship? #HelsinkiSummit
#Trump: Dialogue is not only good for U.S., #Russia, but good for world. If we're going to solve many of the problems facing our world, we're going to have to find ways to cooperate in our shared interests. We've seen too many times when diplomacy is left on the table.//Thoughts?

#Putin: This atmosphere of cooperation is something we are grateful for. Grateful to the Finish people and our Finish hosts.//What do you think of Putin's statements? #Helsinki
#Putin: On disruption of #elections, I had to re-iterate that the #Russian state has not interfered and isn't going to interfere in U.S. elections.//What do you think of that statement? Enough? Sound? Do you believe it? Should #Trump push issue more with #Putin? #2016elections
#Putin: As far as #Syria is concerned the task of establishing peace in this country could be the first example of the two countries working together.//What do you think? Possible for U.S. and Russia to work together on that? #tellusatoday
#Putin: We believe it necessary to work together, interact on nuclear and military cooperation, arms limitation treaty. We favor maintaining cybersecurity. Our services are cooperating successfully.//Thoughts?
#Putin: "The cold war is a thing of the past." Today both Russia and U.S. face a new set of challenges. Creeping threats of terrorism, snowballing problems in the economy, environment. Can only cope if we join the ranks and work together.//What do you think of Putin's comment?
