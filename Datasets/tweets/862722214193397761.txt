And having power and control always sounds like a great idea, until there is no-one left to fight with.
Sure, the hermits will survive. But they won‚Äôt like it. A fortress is as good at keeping people in as it is keeping people out.		But let‚Äôs be clear. ‚ÄòSchool choice‚Äô isn‚Äôt about choice. It‚Äôs about power and control.
Let‚Äôs be clear:		‚ÄòSchool choice‚Äô IS the not-in-my-backyard argument‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääthe protect-my-own-from-you-heathens argument‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääthe why-the-hell-should-I-care-about-you? argument.
Public schools were closed outright, and vouchers were then used at the new, privately segregated schools, known as segregation academies.		The name for this segregation movement?		üö®üö®üö®	Freedom of Choice Schools	https://t.co/gU2Iq84hGX
In some districts, white families created private schools in response to the Brown vs. Board of Education Supreme Court ruling (requiring public school boards to eliminate segregation). 	https://t.co/jlEU8TzQgQ
As recently as the mid-20th Century, school vouchers were used as a way for families to avoid desegregation‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääor more aptly, a way to enable families to perpetuate segregation of white students into their own schools.
Here's the risk: Lines can be drawn between choice programs and funding mechanisms in such as way that publicly-funded education can mean‚Ä¶ just about anything‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääa free-for-all with no rules, and no boundaries.
Progressive populations were integral in its genesis‚Ää‚Äî‚Äästarting during the 1960s as a response to resistance of the status quo.	https://t.co/iaSGQSYTsU
The 21st Century version of the school choice movement has taken on a certain veneer of ‚Äúangst,‚Äù though, considering the zeal with which the conservative right has enabled school choice as a way to control our collective and community reality‚Ää and the narrative that surrounds it.
School Choice: A Brief History		School choice isn‚Äôt a new conservative scheme to undermine the public school system. It‚Äôs just not‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääat least not by definition. It‚Äôs decades old.		LINK: https://t.co/dOcuDYEpcI https://t.co/m6eG7SZDbG

Symbolically, the fireweed is a healer, replacing trauma with beauty. Indeed, its blooms resemble hearts or butterflies, signifying its purpose: healing, change, and transformation. https://t.co/0EQY5wPczq
Although it‚Äôs known to bloom in burned areas, it also commonly takes root in areas healing from disruption. It proliferated during the expansion of the railroad (which disturbed the soil and related ecosystems) and it populated burned ground after the bombing of London in WW I.
Fireweed (Chamaenerion, or Evening Primrose) is a flower known to colonize areas burned by fire. Considered a ‚Äúpioneer species,‚Äù fireweed is the first to populate an area ripe for change.		LINK: https://t.co/IDEvyIyNxS https://t.co/d1q9R6XpTk

@EmbryoResist Well... I don't know that circumstances have changed, but people have. We all have.
@EmbryoResist I think back then, there was more pressure to *not* do the things that needed being done.
@EmbryoResist I missed you, too! Well... not then, but perhaps that's old news. *Everything* is different now.
If that isn't Hell, I don't know what is.		Whether ignored or watched, pardoned or convicted, that is their life's sentence.		They didn't have the courage and the heart to do the right thing.		Watch.		Listen.		Learn.		Choose.		/END
They had a choice.		Regardless of corporal circumstance, people chose to sacrifice spiritually for the sake of power and safety.		For the entirety of their lives, they will either work to convince themselves of unearned innocence, or live with the constant fire of guilt.
During the hearing today (LINKED), with only a few exceptions, respondents answered with deflection and thrown up hands.		I know jobs are critical to wellbeing. Everyone needs to put food on the table.		But people's lives were and are at stake.		https://t.co/1OKc7sivhW
...and others stood back and watched. Or worse, participated in the horror titled, "No One Cares." 		In either case, people made a CHOICE.		Yes, there will always be ramifications, but we *always* have the choice to do the right thing. (Thanks Spike Lee.) https://t.co/J1ikYdk7il
To my knowledge, no one claimed whistleblower status to help hurricane victims. They just *did the thing* they needed to do.		I can't claim to know the back end processes, but Federal staff members - even with hands tied - did what they could to make things right.
In the midst of Hurricane Harvey‚Ä¶ in the midst of Hurricane Maria, Federal staff were *indispensable* in the rescue efforts. No, it didn't go well. But first responders fought against both weather and their government to DO THE RIGHT THING. 		And it was no secret.
I watched and listened with both fascination and disgust. How could *anyone* be okay with what has been happening (is happening) with refugee families? How can *anyone* claim "I didn't ask questions" or "It was just my job" or "I was just following orders"?
I was struck not as much by congressional questioning, but by the answers of the Federal staff.		Committee members asked the questions you'd expect, with the passion you'd expect: Democrats pressing for answers, and Republicans making excuses and apologizing for said pressing.
I watched the judicial hearings today... the ones where representatives of Homeland Security and others testified about their knowledge and experiences regarding refugee detention - specifically, about family separation and child safety.
So I'm not supposed to talk about it, but...		A crap ton of volunteers worked to save people off of their rooftops in Houston during Hurricane Harvey, then mapped ground conditions for FEMA and Coast Guard first responders in Puerto Rico after Hurricane Maria.
