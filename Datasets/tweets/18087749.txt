@WergerDesign @RealDaveEm Let's see if they correct/retract. But the Friday article was specific in saying that the couple cited medical conditions/health care costs
@WergerDesign @RealDaveEm You're right, they've edited it from their original article on Friday. Promise we didn't make it up. Will follow-up and address on-air.

@prettyplusmore Yeah, I'm not a "former" talk show host.  You'd know something about that, right?

@prettyplusmore You've got bigger challenges than spellcheck. And you actually represent "celebrities?"   Wow...
