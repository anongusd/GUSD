The state can impose the following sanctions if it determines that a violation has occurred: issue a fine, suspend the license, revoke the license, place the licensee on probation with terms, and/or place a limitation on the licensee.
Once an administrative complaint is issued, the licensee must file a response within 30 days. At that time, the licensee can either seek a compliance conference, or request a hearing with the Michigan Administrative Hearing System....
Both administrative complaints assert that students informed Teachnor-Hauk and Hadden about the discomfort they felt during Nassar’s treatments....

News from my employer https://t.co/XBm72I2vZR
Whitmer: One of the issues people don't talk about in Michigan is fewer and fewer people are going into education (teaching). That's a looming crisis.
Gov. Whitmer: The state budget is an incredible lever on universities. those are state tax dollars we are sending to the universities. We should know people are safe.
Gov. Whitmer: As a (sexual survivor) myself, the brave women who came forward (at MSU) should be applauded. Nobody is enjoying this, despite comments made to the news media.
Gov. Whitmer: The mechanics of tomorrow will be much different than we think of mechanics now. We aren't thinking about that.
Gov. Whitmer: It is time for Michigan to set some "audacious" goals for Michigan and work to attain them. Says higher education is not for everyone. "We've had a closed mind-set" towards skilled trades
Gov. Whitmer: We should really talk about the school year (the calendar). Says the way calendar is set up hurts low-income students. "The debates in Lansing have been so disconnected" from what's really happening.
Gov. Whitmer: We have so much science about what works (in education). We have to follow through on it
Gov. Whitmer: To close schools doesn't fix the problem (of low performing schools)

@freep Mosallam: I firmly believe with your leaership, Satish, we will help our survivors heal and become whole.
@freep Mosallam: Satish is a person of integrity. He has broad based support across the campus.
@freep Mosallam: Going forward, politics needs to be left at the shore's edge.
@freep Mosallam thanking the majority of the board for their work on getting rid of Engler. Doesn't say anything about Ferguson or Foster - Engler's two main supporters on the board.
@freep Mosallam: Today, the healing can begin.
@freep Trustee Mosallam (the board's leading critic of Engler): On this day, our survivors no longer have to go bed thinking no one would listen to them.
@freep Kelly: This weighs on me. The only thing that influences me - it's not written in stone that we are a great university. The only way we are a great university is we do what our forefathers did and that is to continue to grow
@freep Kelly: It would be a mistake to try to suggest to the new president that this all has been done.
@freep Trustee Kelly: It's not a partisan decision. I had hoped we would get through four to six months and see a new president
@freep Trustee Ferguson makes no comment when called on
@freep Byrum: None of our work will matter if our leaders say hurtful things. The board deeply regrets the impact (of Engler's comment) to survivors and on the community.
Byrum: I believe this is the beginning of a better relationship, both among board members and to the community. @freep

@JMSparty08 @SpartyBasketbal @Graham_Couch @freep also remember that DeVos' federal department of education draft guidelines of how colleges must handle sex assault investigation mirror this and previous rulings in the Sixth Circuit. Those guidelines cover everyone
@Justin4MSU @freep that's unclear.
@Justin4MSU @freep No. Sixth circuit believes due process mandates the ability for cross-examination. Ruling will apply to every public university in 6th circuit including all in Michigan. If they don’t do live hearings and cross exam they will be sued by those accused and lose

@thatluckyolsun she was suppeonad by Congress
Although the school devoted its diligent efforts to improving and enhancing MSU’s policies, procedures, training, staffing, and communications to protect our students and guard against sexual misconduct, Nassar continued to prey on survivors under the guise of medical treatments.
Not a day goes by without me wishing that he had been caught and punished sooner. And not a day goes by without me wondering what we missed and what could have been done to detect his evil before a former youth gymnast filed her complaint with the MSU Police in 2016.
More Simon: Had I known that Nassar was sexually abusing young women, I would have taken immediate action to prevent him from preying on additional victims, including terminating his employment and reporting him to the police."
More Simon: "I am horrified that Nassar’s crimes happened during my tenure.
More Simon: "Nassar’s abuse of innocent survivors marks Michigan State’s darkest hour. I am truly sorry for the abuse the survivors of Nassar suffered, the pain it caused, and the pain it continues to cause today."
Former MSU President Simon in prepared remarks: "To the survivors of Nassar’s abuse, I can never say enough that I am so sorry that a trusted, renowned physician turned out to be an evil predator, and I am sorry that we did not discover his crimes and remove him ... sooner."

Spencer attorney @KyleBristow on U-M decision:: "on my watch the freedoms guaranteed by the U.S. Constitution will not be usurped by left-wing bureaucrats who cater to the threats of left-wing students. Hail to the Victors: Richard Spencer, Cameron Padgett, and Kyle Bristow!
Crowd still chanting in union hallway: "Just say no"
Meeting is over. Regents and administrators leave by back door, escorted by police
Student Hafsa Tout: When Richard Spencer arrives, I will be ashamed to walk the same campus.
RT @HiyamaAndrew: Alicia Smith, Umich staff member: It's not Richard Spencer himself we fear death from, it's his followers
Faculty Michael Weiss: If our rivals in Columbus and East Lansing can find the courage to reject Spencer, so should the leaders and best.
Faculty Michael Weiss, who's grandparents are Holocuast survivors, invoked Raoul Wallenberg, who U-M honors every year.
Regent @drshaunadiggs: i support free speech, not hate speech. We know from Spencer's past speeches we know what he stands for. I'm in support of president's decision.
Student Vidhya Aravind: Say no to Richard Spencer, and if you don't, be ready to have my blood on your hands.
Student Vidhya Aravind: "White supremacy is so nonsensical it should not be allowed in an academic setting."
Regent Andrew Richner says he agrees with university approach
RT @AlexKourvo: @reporterdavidj I'm in the middle of the hall so can only get a partial picture. https://t.co/CrWEeX55mj
Zoe Proegler, who is an student worker at union says the university shouldn't force workers to set up for Spencer's event.
RT @AlexKourvo: @reporterdavidj 250 + people in the hall. We're watching the live stream .
Nando Felten: I don't understand this decision. I don't feel safe.
RT @UMPublicAffairs: Additional information can be found here: https://t.co/ZNtQF9fqvN #UMichRegents
@AlexKourvo How many people are out there?
RT @AlexKourvo: @reporterdavidj Keep tweeting! We're in the hall and want to know!
There is a crowd outside of meeting room. Can hear cheers after speakers they agree with
Student Brittney Williams is first speaker.  Says she is black, a woman and bisexual, all of which she says Spencer hates. Says she can't be safe on a campus open to Spencer
Now onto comments from the public. There are 15 speakers signed up. Each speaker gets 3 minutes
Regent @RonaldWeiser: Fully support @DrMarkSchlissel. As a Jew who's family was murdered by Nazis I reject this odious person's view, but have to follow Constitution
BREAKING: University of Michigan takes step towards letting white supremacist Richard Spencer speak https://t.co/bXtpeypu1f via @freep
Regent @MichiganAndi: I reject this speaker's views in every way.. but must follow Constitution
RT @riyah_basha: U launches new website on free speech on campus: https://t.co/NojeSVTUy8
Regent @MGoBernstein: And on our tombstone will read - ‘Here lies the University of Michigan. Afraid to do the right and difficult thing, it compromised its commitment to the constitution and died failing to live up to the bedrock value of free expression
. @MGoBernstein: We could ban Richard Spencer. Everyone would celebrate. The Board would be cheered. President Schlissel would be applauded. BUT we would be dancing on our own grave.
. @MGoBernstein: The only thing worse than Richard Spencer being on our campus is not allowing him to speak on our campus.
Regent @DeniseDI: Violence follows him wherever he goes. I am not willing to risk history repeating itself
Regent @DeniseDI: I do not agree with the U-M administration. I agree with MSU, Penn State, etc.. in denying his request to speak.
. @DrMarkSchlissel: All of us can unite against the evils of racism, anti-Semitism, discrimination and those who seek to degrade and diminish others. No one who rents space on our campus can take that away from us.
. @DrMarkSchlissel: We can also deprive him of the attention he needs to survive and deny him the crowds he craves. Imagine the power of a room mostly empty, with his only audience being a few followers surrounded by hundreds of empty seats.
. @DrMarkSchlissel: Many followers who show up at his rallies share his repugnant beliefs and should be shunned by our community.
. @DrMarkSchlissel: I personally detest and reject the hateful white supremacy and white nationalism expressed by Mr. Spencer
Crowd not happy with decision https://t.co/V00bdI4JGh
Students shouting over @DrMarkSchlissel. "If you bring a Nazi in nothing is safe."
. @DrMarkSchlissel: as a public university, the law and our commitment to free speech forbid us from declining a speaker based on the presumed content of speech.
BREAKING: @DrMarkSchlissel: I will begin discussions with Richard Spencer's group to let him speak on campus. If we can't assure safety we won't let it go forward.
@DrMarkSchlissel: We only today finalized our plans.
RT @riyah_basha: Pres. @DrMarkSchlissel calls meeting to order. Here we go #UMichRegents
There is a large crowd at the meeting https://t.co/CQezep44aX
The decision whether to let Spencer - who some describe as a white supremacist - rests with #UMICH Pres. @DrMarkSchlissel. Not sure what the board will do, other than offer their opinions.
