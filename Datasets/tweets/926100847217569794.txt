Comey is HRC's lapdog. She obviously has goods on him. The motive for HRC is diversion. As long as she keeps the spotlight on Trump and Comey, regardless of outcome, it keeps it off of her. Alinsky 101. Mick Jagger said it best: "but what's puzzling you is the nature of my game".
Regardless of HRC's plausible deniability with Alinsky, or the devil, projecting her own Russian involvement (with U1, Putin, excessive payoffs to the CF), and worse all drive to the core of Comey's bias and cover-up. Whatever HRC holds over Comey, she directs him. Then and now.
When you stitch together the differences in Alinsky and HRC, you uncover HRC's express desire to do internally inside the govt what Alinsky thought could only be done outside, per this article: https://t.co/Us5qGGM0by
Sympathy for the Devil &amp; Alinsky 101: Hillary's 1969 undergrad thesis on Alinsky guides her plan about Russian Collusion and Trump. True to form, HRC projects her own collusion with Putin onto Trump through complex internal mechanisms, such as paid dossier, FBI invg. Goes deeper.

Perhaps one of the best things come out of the Flynn case is the two conspiracy convictions. Laying modern precedence for the left half of Robert Mueller's lopsided neglected investigation. #DrainTheDeepState
If Robert Mueller can't nail down motives apparently he's willing to manufacture them.
Perhaps what the Russians did was less about helping Trump and more about defeating the evil Menace of the Clinton Dynasty. Especially after what Hillary did to Bernie. Perhaps they were just protecting the interests of Russian American citizens. Or not.
The Fed should do more to coordinate the timing of their rate hikes with the the administration's course of action regarding improvements with the economy knowing those improvements are coming. Consequential liabilities for mistiming &amp; detrimental outcomes should fall on the Fed.
Perhaps the wall needs to be paid for by either a bond project or entry and exit tolls.
It's harrowing to think the last bastion of authenticity for the Snapchat generation is reduced to a narrow band of rap artists and their wannabe girlfriends, because heaven knows their real girlfriends botoxed butts are fake as hell.
Sounds like George Orwell's 1984 meets Pinky and the Brain.
In a dystopian Google-centric Facebook-scaled world, real news is marginalized to clandestine broadcasts on YouTube while latent Soviets attempt multiple soft coups against the last remaining Free Nation hurling hordes of displaced migrants against inadequately secured borders.
@chuckschumer is the Grinch that stole border security.

@GeraldoRivera @realDonaldTrump @POTUS What about the fact that the Special Counsel himself was appointed only one day after being refused the top spot at the FBI by the guy he is investigating? How is that not a conflict of interest and a violation of rules of court with, in the least, an appearance of impropriety?
Comey continues to take a knee to his own oath of office. A soft guilty plea to his continuing attempted soft coup. Traitorous.
Comey acts like he's the real patriot when in fact his contemptuous behavior is a resounding rejection of what the American people voted for, and tantamount to a soft coup. It's unpatriotic,  treasonous, and he continues to wallow in his own mire. #DrainTheDeepState #MAGA @GOP https://t.co/Pn1GdbNFRO
Britain stands at a crossroads. Either  embrace a true spirit of Brexit and leave the EU, with it's policy of appeasement to it's migrant invasion, or UK can continue to enjoin the EU in that policy. If the later, why leave at all? If the former, why cling at all? @theresa_may

@DrinkLibertea @FoxNews The more he clings to some kind of innocence in the face of his overwhelming guilt, despite the delay of moot due process, the more likely the judge and jury will throw the book at him. Unless he tries to weasel out with a claim to a mistake of fact, person, law, or mental defect
@DrinkLibertea @FoxNews You know what needs due process? Justice for Mollie Tibbetts. Also, Hillary's emails, building the wall, and 45k sealed indictments. #MAGA #BuildTheWall #KAG #JusticeForMollie
@DrinkLibertea @FoxNews Does that include Gen Flynn, Carter Page et al?
@SymoneDSanders So, your ans to a woman's brutal murder is generate bias against an entire gender? Seems a bit hypocritical in the least. Adds an irreverent amount of insensitive false victimhood to an already overpoliticized tragedy of a murder victim, not a harassment victim. #MollieTibbetts
@SymoneDSanders By your OWN logic, the 'toxic masculinity was the problem', yet this male was a criminal from across a border he illegally crossed because the was no barrier preventing it. You're right, we need to keep Mexico's 'toxic masculinity' in Mexico. #BuildTheWall #ToxicFemininity

Respectfully, @SenatorCollins, Americans clearly are divided on the issue of abortion. Obviously, not a satisfactory conclusion. Who best than the Supreme Court to finish sorting out relevances left undone in '73 under completely different circumstances? https://t.co/5DjDjs2edQ

@BlueEllis7000 @hemitruck1234 @Alyssa_Milano 1. Collusion isn't a crime. 2. Trump isn't under investigation.	3. The Russian Hoax is a cover up for Hillary's 'gross negligence' which is a crime.	4. The cover up is a coup 'involving two or more people using legal means to commit an illegal act'.	5. That conspiracy is a crime.
@Liz_Wheeler @realDonaldTrump @GOP Too often, abortion is used as an after-the-fact form of birth control.
