12 Ways Governors can lead on #climate	Action #12: Collaborate in regional climate initiatives. In Virginia, former Governor Terry McAuliffe set the state on a course to take part in the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, a regional power plant emissions cap-and-invest program.
12 Ways Governors can lead on #climate	Action #11: Limit new fossil-fuel infrastructure. In Pennsylvania, Governor Tom Wolf issued an executive order reinstating a moratorium on new leases for oil and gas development in state parks and forests.
12 Ways Governors can lead on #climate	Action #10: Incentivize #ElectricVehicles and adopt #CleanerCar standards. In Colorado, Governor John Hickenlooper began the process of adopting cleaner vehicle standards through an executive order in 2018.
12 Ways Governors can lead on #climate	Action #9: Shift transportation spending and policies to support low-carbon models. In Delaware, former Governor Jack Markell directed the Delaware DOT to improve infrastructure for walking or biking whenever building or maintaining roadway.
12 Ways Governors can lead on #climate	Action #8: Set strong energy building codes. In Oregon, Governor Kate Brown directed the amendment of state building codes to require new homes and commercial buildings meet stringent efficiency standards and be EV and solar ready by 2025.
12 Ways Governors can lead on #climate	Action #7: Direct state agencies to reduce waste from state operations. In Pennsylvania, former Governor Ed Rendell directed state government to procure efficient products and develop #EnergyConservation measures for state-owned buildings.
12 Ways Governors can lead on #climate	Action #6: Direct state agencies to adopt and encourage #ElectricVehicles. 9 governors signed onto the Multi-State ZEV Task Force to accelerate state agency adoption of #ZeroEmissionVehicles to help achieve a goal of 3.3 million ZEVs by 2025
12 Ways Governors can lead on #climate	Action #5: Direct state agencies to deploy #CleanEnergy. In Massachusetts, former Governor Deval Patrick’s directive led to state operations reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 28% and increasing #Solar energy capacity nearly 400-fold.
12 Ways Governors can lead on #climate	Action #4: Set a waste reduction goal. In Maryland, former Governor Martin O’Malley set a goal for the state to divert 85% of its waste away from landfills by 2040 and achieve an 80% recycling rate.
12 Ways Governors can lead on #climate	Action #3: Set goals for #ElectricVehicles. In Oregon, Governor Kate Brown established a state EV goal. She also set into motion an EV rebate program and the installation of EV charging infrastructure.
12 Ways Governors can lead on #climate	Action #2: Set strong #CleanEnergy and energy reduction goals. In New Jersey, Governor Phil Murphy’s #OffshoreWind goal led to the nation’s largest offshore wind solicitation to date.
12 Ways Governors can lead on #climate	Action #1: Set a strong statewide emission reduction goal. For example, in California, Governor Jerry Brown set a 40% emission reduction target adopted by the state legislature 1 yr later.

@SteveBlackledge @realDonaldTrump @SecretaryZinke “It may have been the ethics inquiries that did him in, or perhaps it was always in the cards to do two years, but from where I stand, Secretary Zinke's biggest failure is that he aspired to be a Teddy Roosevelt conservationist and fell woefully short"

Freezing the fuel economy standards at 2020 levels would increase global warming emissions by 2.2 million metric tons.  We need to move forward &amp; significantly reduce global warming emissions, not backward.  The NPRM to be released goes the wrong way on clean cars.
Good to hear @EPAAWheeler say NPRM on fuel economy standards to come out tomorrow is just a proposal.  Hoping EPA under @EPAAWheeler  understands clean car standards are the single most effective tool we have to fix global warming and will not go the wrong way on clean cars.

...as #SolarEclipse2017 will give us a preview of, but it’s still 100% necessary — and we have to be up to the challenge 21/x
Ultimately, we know we need to keep aiming for 100 percent renewable energy. That’ll certainly come with its challenges... 20/
Instead of using fossil fuels as backup when the sun isn’t shining—whether it’s a rare eclipse or nighttime—we'll use clean energy 19/
As prices have plummeted over the last decade, battery storage capacity in the US has grown 2,000%. That's expected to continue 18/ https://t.co/GM3hCuSwue
You might be asking: Where is all that extra #solar energy going to go, you ask? 		Well, we've got an answer for you: Battery storage 17/
And with rooftop #solar alone, we could produce about 112 times the amount of solar we’re expected to lose during the #Eclipse 16/
According to @NREL, enough sunlight hits the United States to meet our electricity needs 100 times over 15/ https://t.co/hSUmnZ8d9Q
Those 10,000 MW of solar electricity that we’re losing during #SolarEclipse2017 are dwarfed by solar’s potential throughout the country 14/
Some are pointing to that lost electricity as a knock on #solar’s reliability, but let’s put that number in perspective for a moment 13/
Experts predict that about 10,000 MW of solar electricity will be blocked by the #SolarEclipse, which is enough to power 7 million homes 12/
In fact, during a three hour period on March 11, the electricity used by Californians was about 50% #solar 11/
#California, a state that relies on #solar for as much as 40% of its electricity on some days, is already doing it 10/
Of course, getting more #solar onto the grid will have to happen as we move towards 100% #RenewableEnergy #Go100Percent 9/
#Solar may still only be about 1% of US electricity, but its rapid growth has many thinking about how we'll get more onto the grid 8/
At the end of 2016, we were at 1.4 million, and we’re expected to hit the 2 million mark in just 2 years 7/
And finally, in early 2016, about 40 years after the 1st solar panels came online, the US surpassed 1 million installations nationwide 6/
Distributed #solar energy, which includes panels installed on homes &amp; office buildings, increased 2,800% over those same 10 years 5/
The US produces about 43X more #solar energy today than 10 years ago, enough to power more than 5 million average-sized American homes 4/ https://t.co/WQv3RPy6LZ
Suffice to say, a lot has changed in 38 years — and the last decade in particular. A few highlights from the last 10 years include: 3/
When the last #solar eclipse occurred 38 years ago, electricity generated from the sun made up a negligible piece of the electrical grid 2/
