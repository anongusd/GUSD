Definitely reading any email that begins "I am the polygamy reporter at The Salt Lake Tribune." Here's the latest from @natecarlisle https://t.co/1AVkewAG7N
Another approach to beating yourself up over such tasks is to see them as mistakes you can learn from. Like if you have a lot of ill-fitting clothes you struggle to return by mail, the solution could be as simple swallowing the loss and going back to buying things in stores.
Struggling w tasks defined like this is not a generational thing: "the vast majority of these tasks shares a common denominator: Their primary beneficiary is me, but not in a way that would actually drastically improve my life. They are seemingly high-effort, low-reward tasks."
Like, if it takes 2 years to take your knives to be professionally sharpened, it means that this task is not a life priority and is something you can let go of entirely or do in a less perfect way, such as by buying a $5 knife sharpener on Amazon.
The deciding on priorities part is key. So is being OK with imperfection. There's even a whole best-selling self-help literature on this front, like Brene Brown's The Gifts of Imperfection.
It's not just that people are burned out, it's that they've been given a bad tool for thinking about organizing their lives. Tracking what you actually do and building on your daily accomplishments is a better approach to errand completion + deciding on priorities in my opinion.
The to-do list is not actually the most effective productivity tool. I switched from the "to do list" to the "done list" approach after reading this argument that 41% of to-do list items are never completed &amp; only 15% of done items start on to-do lists. https://t.co/Glh1dFreVK
