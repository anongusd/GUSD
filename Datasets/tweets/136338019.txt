I would be hugely remiss if I didn't give a shout out to @lisamurkowski for helping lead several bills being voted on TODAY in the House. That includes the Nuclear Energy Innovation Capabilities Act which would create a strong new foundation for this vital clean power
Thanks for your leadership on this, Congressman! Can't stress enough that despite the recent cost-declines in batteries, they are no substitutes for the long-duration energy storage services pumped storage facilities can provide the increased intermittent renewables coming online https://t.co/3VhLtPqtce
This is a MAJOR SUITE of Republican and bipartisan efforts to help hydropower, one of our most flexible sources of clean power that can be quickly adjusted to match real-time changes in power demand. Should not be overlooked
Language from @RepMGriffith does same for pumped storage facilities that can provide invaluable longterm energy storage for renewable and other power sources. AND @cathymcmorris included important parts of her bill quickening licensing and relicensing of non-fed hydropower
It also has an important bill from @RepLarryBucshon to streamline environmental review process for qualifying non-powered dam hydro projects, which @ENERGY says has power potential equal to TWO DOZEN large coal plants.
Separately, the water infrastructure bill just passed by the House has important reforms to help #hydropower, one of the most overlooked forms of reliable clean power. That includes important language from @RepRichHudson @RepDianaDeGette on hugely promising small conduit projects
This gif and logo for #NELA2018 is really cool! Lots of great stuff in this bill for advanced nuclear! https://t.co/RGD8Irspt0
It's a BIG day on Capitol Hill for clean energy! Starting with a FY19 bill that makes critical programmatic direction and eagle-eyed investments in advanced nuclear, carbon capture, grid-scale storage and other next-gen energy technologies. This really is a major win
Looks like at least some of a critical bill from @cathymcmorris made it in to improve burdensome licensing and relicensing for non-federal hydropower facilities. Roughly 400 hydropower projects will be up for relicensing by 2030, representing 18,000 megawatts of capacity.
Language from @RepMGriffith streamlines federal licensing stymying pumped storage hydropower facilities that make up the vast majority of U.S. electricity storage technologies. Despite the recent cost-declines in batteries, they are no substitutes for this long-duration storage
Language from @RepLarryBucshon would streamline environmental reviews for qualifying non-powered dam projects. @ENERGY estimates the U.S. non-powered dam power generation potential is equivalent to roughly 2 DOZEN large coal power plants
Language from @RepRichHudson &amp; @RepDianaDeGette would trim federal reviews of small conduit (or energy-recovery) projects, which use existing water infrastructure and is one the most promising untapped sources for new hydropower (US has 1.2 MILLION miles of water supply mains!)
There is a whole SUITE of great language in this year's WRDA deal to help #hydropower, one of the most overlooked and untapped forms of clean and reliable power: https://t.co/eXXIXDVBWd
Others like @SenJohnHoeven on FEED, @RepChuck on advanced nuclear and @RepNewhouse on energy storage were among those helping to lead the way on specific clean energy wins
All told, there are some BIG BIG wins here for advanced nuclear, carbon capture, energy storage and broader clean energy innovation. Great job to all those involved, including GOP panel leaders such as @SenAlexander, @CongMikeSimpson, @SenShelby, @USRepRodney
Provides $366 million @ARPAE effort, directs spending ($10 million) for the first time for perovskite solar R&amp;D, which can lead to panels that are printable and painted and are potentially thinner and more efficient than today’s panels
Advances and fully funds R&amp;D effort led by @ENERGY’s Energy Innovation Hubs - namely the Joint Center for Energy Storage Research (developing extraordinary new batteries) and the Joint Center for Artificial Photosynthesis (using sunlight to turn water into clean hydrogen fuel)
Increase funding to $46 million for energy storage efforts @ENERGY's Office of Electricity Delivery. And would spur a new facility dedicated to scaling up advanced battery research
Gives $30 million for Front-End Engineering and Design (FEED) assistance for two commercial-scale carbon capture power projects to retrofit an existing coal plant and for a coal or natural gas plant that generates CO2 suitable for utilization or storage
Prioritizes advanced nuclear reactor design R&amp;D; $65 million for versatile test reactor, a national lab facility critical to advanced nuclear development ; $22 million for testing of high assay low-enriched uranium (HA-LEU), which will be needed to fuel many advanced reactors
We are still reviewing the details but what is clear is Congress has again sent an undeniable message that lawmakers are serious about keeping the U.S. in the top tier of countries pursuing clean and reliable energy breakthroughs. Lots of good stuff to highlight: https://t.co/CFJqHxNMRU
Thread! https://t.co/MHCR7GW2NW

Thanks to @EnergyGOP and @EnergyDems for backing an important bill from @RepRichHudson and @RepDianaDeGette that does big things for small hydro! These projects represent huge, untapped clean power potential https://t.co/4KfMoUzxiQ https://t.co/ouOIEtottn
Great work by @CongMikeSimpson and others to craft a FY19 energy spending bill that not just prioritizes basic clean energy research but also all the steps needed toward deployment and commercialization of technologies
It advances and fully funds the ongoing 5-year R&amp;D effort led by @ENERGY innovation hubs - esp Joint Center for Energy Storage Research (developing extraordinary new batteries) &amp; Joint Center for Artificial Photosynthesis (using sunlight to turn water into clean hydrogen fuel)
The bill supports scale-up of #carboncapture efforts, including new solicitations for advanced fossil fuel system engineering, and specifically projects that generate emissions suitable for utilization or storage. Could mean NET Power, Project Tundra and others
Also prioritizes R&amp;D of new advanced reactor designs which helps innovative pending designs -- such as @NuScale_Power’s -- get up and running on schedule; and for advanced reactor technologies that could help more advanced technologies being worked on by Terrapower, X-energy, etc
Includes building on recent omnibus deal asking @ENERGY to map out a “moonshot” goal for demonstrating advanced nuclear technologies with the private sector by the mid to late 2020s AND NEW LANGUAGE launching DOE-wide energy storage effort with aggressive performance targets
. @HouseAppropsGOP today approved a FY19 energy bill giving tremendous backing to clean and reliable power breakthroughs AND recognizes that while steady and sufficient funding is essential, providing direction to @ENERGY to make sure that dollars are well spent is EQUALLY vital
Incredible advances in passive shutdown @NuScale_Power - they even let someone like me play with the controls, and nothing went wrong! The control room is entirely digital and modern, and highly automated - a real look into nuclear's future. Many thanks to NuScale team! https://t.co/KY4p1WolAe

The changes Congress made to the #45Q tax credit are hugely significant. But the promise of carbon capture technology can’t rest on this one fix alone. @mrjayoh and I explain what else we need from lawmakers and policymakers
Congress fixed the #45Q carbon capture tax credit, a big, big deal. But a really ambitious agenda is still needed to propel carbon capture tech into the mainstream, drive down costs and instill sufficient investor confidence. @mrjayoh and I break down what else is needed
REALLY important sequel to FUTURE Act (#45Q). Directs @EPA to support direct air capture research, improves permitting of carbon capture facilities AND the pipelines carrying captured CO2 that can be used for enhanced oil recovery, storage and to be developed into products https://t.co/97xouRSju4
Well worth reading this great op-ed from @SenJohnHoeven, who has helped lead carbon capture efforts, especially at his state's Project Tundra coal retrofit effort https://t.co/v2wGEeqBD5 via @RollCall
Suffice it to say, there are many to thank for all this, starting with @SenAlexander and @CongMikeSimpson for shepherding this all through their respective energy spending panels
More funding for carbon capture and storage efforts @ENERGY including directed at the @NCarbonCaptureC, which helps bridge the gap between laboratory research and large-scale demonstrations
#Omnibus appears to open the door for 10s of millions of additional dollars to be dedicated to help @NuScale_Power small modular reactor effort. And gives more $ more broadly for @NRCgov to help license advanced #nuclear reactors
GREAT increase for @ARPAE to $353 million and 25 percent rise for energy storage efforts @ENERGY. Would still like to see dedicated storage goals such as those advocated by @JeffFlake and @MartinHeinrich but funding boost is a big plus
LOTS of good stuff in #omnibus re: clean energy innovation.
