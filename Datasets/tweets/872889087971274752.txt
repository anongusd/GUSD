@HughJasoull @jimmykimmel @seanhannity @FLOTUS Liberals don‚Äôt own immigrants.  They don‚Äôt help us. They don‚Äôt empower us.  They simply use US! #legalimmigrantsvoteTrump
@HughJasoull @jimmykimmel @seanhannity @FLOTUS Kimmel called out Hannity too. Who cares. That‚Äôs what they do.  I‚Äôm defending Melania as she has exuded grace and class.  She works hard like most immigrants.  She is also presenting a united front with her husband despite his imperfections.
@HughJasoull @jimmykimmel @seanhannity @FLOTUS Why so you can make fun of me too?  I‚Äôm 100 percent American now and I want lower taxes and healthcare and I follow not break the law.  I didn‚Äôt need a sanctuary city because I‚Äôm a highly skilled worker who doesn‚Äôt break the law!
@HughJasoull @jimmykimmel @seanhannity @FLOTUS I‚Äôm an immigrant who worked very hard on losing an accent when I immigrated here legally.  I can imagine how she must feel.  But it doesn‚Äôt take an immigrant to see that Jimmy Kimmel should leave our Flotus alone.
@HughJasoull Well then you shouldn‚Äôt defend something that is clearly wrong based on your politics.  Trump is not perfect. He was elected.....#becauseHilary https://t.co/abLloKeR1Z
@HughJasoull @jimmykimmel @seanhannity @FLOTUS I‚Äôm sure she tried very hard to lose the accent even though she speaks 5 other languages and seeing the world laughing at her when she has done nothing to anyone is just wrong.  I‚Äôm sure it hurts her.
@HughJasoull @jimmykimmel @seanhannity @FLOTUS You are not the authority on that.  If Trump so much as misquotes or mimics someone YOU call it an Attack!   Spare me the lecture your liberal highness.

@lynxlily @realDonaldTrump @DevinNunes May I remind you that it's not 'legal' to lie to a federal judge using an unverified tabloid dossier...you bought n paid for .... to spy on your 'American' political opponent #FisaAbuse

@MrJHeckles @JohnLegere @TMobile I don't need my damn cell phone provider to tell me how to be a good person and I sure as hell don‚Äôt need to listen to some misguided liberal who‚Äôs only solution is to attack people‚Äôs identity rather than their policies.
@JohnLegere @TMobile How about they mind their own business and focus on providing better cell phone service.  I don't need a lecture from my cell phone provider.
@TMobile I‚Äôd rather pay more for my cellphone than to have you lecture me about social justice.  Time to switch.
@JLo How come you aren't doing Superbowl halftime show? Instead they get a guy who hasn't released anything in 10 yrs?

@CraigRSawyer They continually poke the üêª with Russia.  They continually try to distract the narrative by creating false flags that hurt innocent people.  This evil must be purged from our government.
@TrumpsDC It makes no sense but neither did giving weapons to foreign rebel groups so they were equipped to shoot down a Russian plane with a US missle.  But that‚Äôs Deepstate Logic for you. https://t.co/yWySNfZcTv
