@BluegrassPundit she is head of the unAmerican dems that r forcing Obamacare into our personal lives.
@foxandfriends this is yet another example of dems making backrooms deals for a med plan that americans don't want. Dems are t
happy new everyone...looking forwarded to a great twitter year!
@BreakingNews a little late. Thank God for the heros on board. Obama r u listening...WAKE UP!!!
@ChrisCuomo what is realy a nightmare is:POTUS wasnt informed immediately.3hrs went by bfore told shows how little this gov cares about us.
@Drudge_Report really...??? Maybe it just that he knows that this is the wrong thing to do deep down in his black heart!
@SenJohnMcCain dems r corrupt. Thetir votes were bought. Obama is the leader of the corruption. What can be done now!!!???
@GMA pissed that dems have forced obamacare upon use. They sold their votes for pork.
@techna_tweet the Democrates all 60
@techna_tweet thank you ffor saying that. Dems will pay dearly for this. This is a corrupt bunch!
@USRealityCheck the people that voted for him.
@politico franken is doing what he told to do. He is a comedian ... The joke is on him & dems.
@USRealityCheck he reps the citizens of the US.This Obamacare is going to hurt every citizen. Taxes have to be raised& medicare weakened.
@Lnfritzky notstating that their are no emotional issues.But please dont try to feed the old story, she didnt know that something was up.
@datelinenbc why do a story on someone's personal issues. I thought that dateline was better than this!
@Lnfritzky she is no where near poor!!!!
@BreakingNews shows how anyone can get a Nobel prize. Look at Al Gore...he did what? Oh..a movie???
@ChrisCuomo hey guy w/2 angels. Think up something else. That statement makes her look stupid.
@michellemalkin I have read ur article. Very interesting look at Obamagate and the his cronies. Thanks http://myloc.me/1NMxZ
@BarackObama you mean closer to socialism, rationing of health care, higher taxes...dems should be ashamed of themselves.
It looks like there is an all out war on women.1st breast cancer now pap smear.Why not just give women casket now.We're going to die anyway.
@CBSNews I am alive because of an annual pap smear. This is an attack of women's health and survial. Thanks dems and Obamacare.
@BarackObama medicare is mismanaged.They r approving procedures that never took place.Who is going to pay& manage obamacare the same idiots
@PoliticalTicker he should, he could learn something. Maybe he will have someone else read it to him.  http://myloc.me/1zy0E
@KarlRove I have been saying this for days. Obama represents USA like a 3rd world country, which we r not. We r and will always be 1#.
@nprpolitics what makes her view different than a man's in the same situation? This is her reality u need to respect that.
@foxandfriends wonder what he is gooing to say?  http://myloc.me/1yikq
@Drudge_Report no bowing...simple. We r Americans not subjects to any nation. Obama is a disgrace to our democracy. http://myloc.me/1xi8r
@MorningJoeguest great! Will be there?
@nerdist I'm afraid so...no halloween...no thanksgiving...go shopping then Christmas! http://myloc.me/1wvgf
@BreakfastNews simple answer...NO!
@RepublicanGOP that is amazing! 1hen did this happen and why...dems r at it again. Disgraceful! http://myloc.me/1wuUH
@whitehouse yes,they make a profit.Unlike the gov they have respect for money&shareholders. When was the last time a gov has been balanced?
@MariahCarey yes, its working! http://myloc.me/1vsqS
@RepublicanGOP An American never bends his/her knee to NO ONE!!!!

@RepublicanGOP POTUS is off again. What is he going to apologize for now. Being a America! http://myloc.me/1sQLz

@foxandfriends these wars need to end & will end with proper deployment.Obama is not capable of making decision.He doesn't have it in him.
@nytimeskristof and this surprises u because??? http://myloc.me/1q5pB
@foxandfriends he must truely hate the citizens that he represents. He knows obamacare will costs citizens thousands and health.
@BarackObama @JimOberstar disgraceful!!! http://myloc.me/1p0fs
@AnnCurry I don't trust any politician esp dems. They shouldn't be called dems. They r socialist.  http://myloc.me/1oSeK
@KarlRove I take care of myself & have ins via my employer. Why should I be punished for some elses deliberate bad health habits?
@GStephanopoulos its a disgrace that obamacare has passed. The dems r not listening to the citizens. They have their own agenda.
@anamariecox ur a brain washed dem. Investigate more u may find some truths in pat boone's concerns. Not all but enough to make u wonder.
@politico I don't want Obamacare. I don't want to pay for someone elses bad health habbits. This is taxing without representation!
@CBSNews it's a absolute disgrace that dems think so little of citizens that they will force Obamacare upon us.There must b a hinden agenda
@SenJohnMcCain I work for a large company. We r hurting at every level. What money r u talking about.  http://myloc.me/1mFIH
@ABC who is going to pay for this bastards health care? http://myloc.me/1mDtY
@dj6646 he is stupid to think that freedom has no price he doesn't have the gift of decision making just talk.  http://myloc.me/1mCsF
@SenJohnMcCain obama is not capable of making a major decision re Afghanistan. He is a great mouth piece not a decision maker in this area.
@foxandfriends its amazing that POTUS would spend our time in NJ and not even watch the results. What does that say about him?
@GStephanopoulos no...Obama is not a positive figure any more. At best just a guy that dropped by and went home!
@foxandfriends obama has lied so much who can tell what's the truth. The Dems have proven to be untrust worthy.  http://myloc.me/1iMhI
@RedScareBot Visited the website, interesting and a bit scary. The present admin is very similar to the past. We haven't learned anything.
@nerdist very profound!
@CoryBooker so ur for obamacare, debt, higher taxes and socialism. That doesn't sound so great to me!
@newtgingrich I believe that many dem will find that they will face hostile citizens. This forced obamacare and the economy will there end.
@CNN_Newsroom yes the outrage would have been extreme. Obama is still on a personal honeymoon, but not for long. I'm sick of him already.
obama's war on the chamber and fox is going to backfire  he need to stop running for office and get to work
http://bit.ly/vxDLQ This is a ridiculous story. Its a costume that's all.
@CoryBooker so very true...great food for thought.
1st day off in 7 days..have interview candidates, have 2 positions and even with this umempoyment rate 12.2 having trouble finding help
Student loans covered by the government r going to be covered 80%. That will costs citizens billions of $'s. Why hasn't anyone noticed this?
Obama is not telling the truth. Illegal aliens r coverable. They buy into the plan just like ordinary citizens as stated in the plan.
Obama said nothing new. Well, he did threathen opponents to the bill. POTUS is pushing his luck. He may be a 1 term president!
@eonline he is going to ha e a difficut time, because it is an ugly crime and behavior.
Med plan, forced savings, being treated like a child, insulted intellectually...what else can Obama do to insult us???
That's it I'm done I don't want Obama taking my pulse or forcing me t save his way or anthing else for that matter. I am not a socialist!
We have have 30 czars...what for? We lknow little to nothing about these people. R they experts in the fields they r managing???
@BrentSpiner I am replying. Always obey Mother :)
@mrmoorsicle why?
It looks corp r slowly getting out of recession but they r not rehiring or have limited raises.
I'm listening to dems out & out misleading people on this med bill- illegals, pulling the plug on sr and abortion are covered. Read the bill
The gov can't handle the cash for clunkers how can they take care of medical care? Simple
@women4woman. I am looking at ForbesWoman. Take a look and tel me what u think.
@zappos that can mean 2 things:they are mating or they are hot (vibration causes air circulation). Either way:be don't take them home with u
Democratics need to give up this health care program. I can't believe that they can't hear the citizens saying NO. We dont want or need it!!
The stimulus and the health bill has done nothing to help the common man. What it will do is tax the common man to death.
Oil prices r still high. Its $70 this morning. Buy a car and u can't afford the gas! Why buy the car? Keep the 1 u have.
It is incredible that tax  payers are paying for cars that we don't own! A health plan we can't aford. We need jobs! Not a hand out!.
Just reading the almighty 1000 page health bill! The fine print will scare the devil. Say NO" Read ur health plan. Its better than u think.
Have been up for hrs reviewing the international business news. Unemployment in the US is projected to stay in double digets until 2011!

Have had a great day...just plain tired.
