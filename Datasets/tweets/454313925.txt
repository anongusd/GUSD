@ugoglencoco Smoke aloft can travel great distances. @NWSSeattle just posted about Siberian smoke causing hazy conditions. I'm not sure how far you would still be able to smell the smoke, though.
@kakempen If the smoke reduces visibility enough, there can be an impact to Airport Terminal Operations, especially, at larger airports such as San Fransisco. Smoke in between airports may affect enroute commuter flights that fly at lower elevations, and jets as they approach/depart.
@DudleyMecum That is an interesting question. I do not have any information regarding fire starts caused by pyrocumulus clouds for the Carr fire. Perhaps you could pose your question to @CAL_FIRE.
Excessive heat combined with very low humidity and tinder dry fuels makes fire quick ignite and grow. Red Flag Warnings indicate areas at risk of explosive fire growth. Go to https://t.co/33ODsO2xOp for watches and warnings, and https://t.co/CQLCPudplX for safety messages. https://t.co/LYS4RvjE64

Very hot and dry conditions will continue over the west coast states through Sunday. Conditions around the Carr wildfire near Redding, California will continue to be conducive to rapid wildfire growth and spread.

It may be summer, but the current heat wave is dangerously hot. Heat will intensify over the west next week. Northwestern temps may rise into the 90s and triple digits, with up to 127 in the hottest desert locations.. Heat indices up to 115 are possible in south-central U.S.. https://t.co/tDmdTV9Aub
Low pressure along a stalled frontal boundary on the east coast will bring a threat of excessive rain to portions of the Mid Atlantic and New England. Another front may produce heavy rain from the Great Lakes to the Gulf, and monsoon flood threats continue in the Southwest. https://t.co/ue70jeFuzV
Severe thunderstorms possible today across the Deep South, Southeast, and portions of the northern Plains. Isolated severe storms may also develop along the coastal Mid Atlantic and New England.

Hi Dudley. NWS Aviation Forecasters also issue Aviation Warnings called Volcanic Ash SIGMETs and Volcanic ASh Advisories for airborne ash. NWS meteorologists embedded with FAA Air Route Traffic Control Centers can provide additional guidance for FAA Air Traffic Managers.
NWS Weather Forecast offices (WFO) are responsible for issuing Ashfall products following volcanic eruptions. Kilauea has been periodically producing small amounts of ash. Read the @NWSHonolulu Special Weather Statement in the link below for more information. https://t.co/1hW2xS14yv
@Climatologist49 @NWSEastern Yes, the Atlantic Basin, including the Gulf, already had its first storm. That storm originated in the Caribbean.  The Atlantic ocean itself has been quiet.
Tropical Storm #Bud is forecast to intensify as it moves northwestward, with monsoon moisture potentially spreading into the desert southwest, Great Basin, and Rockies later next week. https://t.co/kwQi2CGSCh
Satellites can see the Saharan dust clearly, especially, high resolution #GOESEast. https://t.co/gFBZEmaZGJ

Showers and thunderstorms are expected to develop and impact portions of the Mid-Atlantic region this afternoon into tonight. Some of the rain could be heavy which may cause excessive runoff and flooding of rivers, streams, and low lying areas. Flash Flood Watch in effect.
A deep trough across the western U.S. is bringing strong winds and cool temperatures across the region. This has produced critical fire weather threats in the southwest, snow above 5500 feet adjacent to severe storm warnings in the northern Rockies/Plains, and Freeze Warnings. https://t.co/jD9sxTblc3

Several locations could experience heavy rain and flooding today: Deep South and Southeast with deep tropicial moisture from #Alberto, portions of the Plains from training thunderstorms, and the Northern Rockies/Plains as rainfall exacerbates ongoing flooding. https://t.co/G31gP9zdf9

Portions along the Southeast coast are also experiencing very heavy rainfall as #Alberto sends deep plumes of moisture northward. Rainfall amounts of 5 to 8 inches are possible, and may cause flash flooding. https://t.co/bs0tWX0aZT

@angelafritz So... we got a very long answer. We can DM you more details if you'd like, but the short answer is that there is work being done to develop Multi-Radar/Multi-Sensor System (MRMS) estimates for Hawaii, and when those estimates improve, we can add Hawaii to the national map.
@angelafritz You're welcome. Just sent an email. It's 5:19am there though, so we'll need to give it a little time. 😴
@angelafritz That's a great question! Let us dig in to that for you.
