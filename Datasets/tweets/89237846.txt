On alliances, Moulton will hammer Trump for letting America's relationships atrophy while floating the prospects of modernizing NATO and creating a "Pacific NATO" meant to counter China.
Moulton will call to shift the balance away from lumbering tech like the air craft carrier to more nimble weapons, cyber weapons and autonomous weapons, as well as reemphasizing the soft power spending on things like diplomacy that ends up helping protect the US too.

To be sure, he's also ran Need to Impeach ads in other markets. But the states in the top 10 markets for the ad over these last two days are in IA, NV, and CA (which moved its primary up to earlier in the calendar this cycle).
FWIW: Data from @Ad_Analytics shows that Tom Steyer's Need to Impeach has spent $81k in Iowa TV markets (including some bleed across the border to IL) and $70k in Nevada in the past two days on an ad.		Steyer will announce his "political plans" during an Iowa event Wednesday.

@LoechnerNFL Thanks! I just think range of outcomes is what will flip it to me. TH could get 5-25 points IMO, while Stafford like 7-15 (that said, this is very much not my day job or something I profess to be good at).
@LoechnerNFL perhaps I'm not the only one with a similar question. But interested what you think! In a 2QB league, for second spot, Stafford versus a great Vikes defense (I'm a homer) or roll the dice with Heinicke against the horrible ATL pass defense (leaning the latter).

In total, a closing narrative that unsurprisingly echoes the script Republicans would like him to be following, rather than the White House's current approach of all immigration all the time. (4/4)
Trump also says the consequences of letting the "radical liberals win" are "Open borders will be there, extreme gun control and massive tax increases." (3/4)
He lauds the tax cuts, crediting them for 4 million new jobs (basically all that have been created since he took office), says "We have great new trade deals, a wall being built on the border, the strongest military we've ever had, and we are taking care of our vets. " (2/4)
I just received the president's @FloridaGOP robocall despite not being a Florida voter. In it, the president rails against the "horrible and even disgusting character assassinations and attacks" on both Brett Kavanaugh and Neil Gorsuch and warns against the "liberal mob." (1/4)

@ComfortablySmug Thanks!
Will be interesting if Renacci spends a significant portion of his cash on hand in the final weeks of the race, or if he chooses to end the campaign with enough in the bank to fully repay his own personal loan.
In the pre-primary, which spans Oct 1 to Oct 17, Renacci spent $369k. By comparison, Brown spent $3.2 mil over that span. Other Senate candidates like Hawley and Scott all spent multiple millions too. And when that period ended, Renacci still had $4.5 million in the bank
Something I've noticed in #OHSen FEC reports recently: Renacci keeps spending just enough to stay above $4 mil in cash on hand. Since he loaned his campaign the $4 million, he's ended each filing period with more than $4 million in the bank.
IF it's Thursday, it's "Ben stares at FEC reports all day." 		New #FLSen nugget: @ScottforFlorida gave his campaign another $12 mil this month.

She added that she's had to change her license plates and has been harassed online after the ads began.
MORE details from the Cisneros, Fazli meeting: she said she had a change of heart about the CLF ads because she heard from people that assumed the ad meant she had been assaulted. 		"It all insinuates it was a lot more than it was, and they did it without my permission." --Fazli

Soto has won a bevy of endorsements (Biden, John Lewis, Gabby Giffords). Grayson, Dem groups), Grayson is hoping his past network can help him strike gold again (he had been a popular figure among liberals during his stint in Congress).
One under-the-radar primary tomorrow is the race between Dem Rep. Darren Soto and former Rep. Alan Grayson, who wants his seat back. 		Since July, Soto has benefited from more than $884k in independent expenditures, according to FEC #s. And the race has gotten rough at times.

Note: the question is whether voters have positive or negative feelings about ICE, it was NOT about whether to "Abolish ICE." https://t.co/ikI96F95Ei
So it's not a home-run issue either way. But more positive feelings about ICE than negative feelings in much of the House/Sen battleground.
Most relevant campaign findings may be that a similar 44ish percent plurality has a positive feeling about ICE in @CookPolitical toss-up and leaner districts, GOP-held districts (read: most of the 2018 battleground), and Rust Belt (IN, MI, OH, PA, WI).
Overwhelming majority of GOP feels positively about ICE, significant majority of Dems feel negative. That could mean the "Abolish ICE" issue could play well with their respective bases.
Here's a chart with some key demographic breakdowns on positive/negative feelings about ICE from the NBC/WSJ poll of registered voters: https://t.co/QPb9187C85

And the appeal itself: https://t.co/quAatcfGsD
Here's the statement on the appeal: https://t.co/kFbnaM3iH9
Earlier appeals, including to SCOTUS, fell short. So if court decides to take up, this won't matter for '18. But it would have an impact ahead of the next round of redistricting in 2020
The GOP hates these new maps, not just because of those arguments, but because it has been a boon for Democrats and has helped make more seats competitive. At the start of this cycle, Dems held just 5 of the 18 congressional seats despite PA being a swing state.
Their argument is similar to previous ones--that the state court legislated from the bench and didn't give the legislature enough time to come to an agreement with the gov on new maps.

RT @JessicaTaylor: Mine too! He even has a Bernie Sanders tattoo! https://t.co/7jEVIO1jy8
Also, with Trump's endorsement coming hours before the vote closed, it's possible that the runoff helps Arrington because it allows that endorsement to resonate. https://t.co/Wdxg4Z2dPE

The DCCC spent a hell of a lot of $ nuking GOP candidates in California, but it appears to be close to getting what it wanted. In #CA39, the nuked GOPers are in 5th and 6th. #CA49, nuked GOPer in 6th. #CA48 the only question mark, with targeted GOP candidate in a close third.

Debate comes to a close with a scrappy bit at the end over Romney's past criticism of Trump, but little fireworks overall.
.@Romney4Utah pushes back, saying Trump endorsed him. Then he reads some of Jeffress's most controversial comments about Mormonism, doubles down on it and says @KennedyForUtah shouldn't have apologized to Jeffress #utdebates
After Romney said he wants to find common ground in Washington, @KennedyForUtah hits back: "When he’s labeling President Trump as a phony and as a fraud and Pastor Jeffress as a bigot, I don’t see those as productive steps." #utdebates
.@Romney4Utah says he's for medicinal pot if tightly regulated (prescriptions filled at pharmacies). Says Utah ballot q will "open the door to corner stores selling marijuana-laced brownies and gummy bears. You are going to have marijuana in our schools." #utdebates
I wanted to say this but I don't think I've been within 200 miles of Utah. https://t.co/nnSVRn4dg3
This debate is so, so, so nice. Both candidates repeatedly thanking each other and using their extra time to thank the other #UTdebates
Kennedy: "it's not the gun that fires itself, it's the person behind the gun." Better mental health services, more community outreach, ability to capture warning signs. Disagrees with Romney on bump-stock ban.
Guns: 	--Romney: no new federal gun legislation except background checks +bump stocks. Says schools should be more like banks, armed guards, limit access, possibly metal detectors, anonymously report, intervention team available for at risk people. 	 (1/2)
On trade: @KennedyForUtah lauds Trump for his mastery of "art of negotiation." @Romney4Utah backs TPP, says NAFTA should be renegotiated on deal with cars w/ Mexico, and praises Trump for being tough on China while warning broad tariffs not good for Utah.
The O-Care question comes up. @Romney4Utah argues for repeal and return to state. Kennedy says free market the best, chides Romney for having "created more government programs" on health care while in Mass. Says while he respects that, that's not right for Utah.
In his opening statement, @Romney4Utah argues that his experience + relationships with WH and GOP Senators will help replace some of Orrin Hatch's "clout." "I believe I’ll be able to help Utah continue to punch above its weight.” #UTdebates
Kennedy, a state rep, opens with a lighthearted dig at Romney, says Utah is doing so well even a Boston businessman wants to relocate there #UTdebates

.@DonBlankenship is going out by trying to light @MorriseyWV's campaign on fire as well. Tells @ABC Morrisey/Manchin is a tough choice, says he likely won't support Manchin if Morrisey wins but won't rule it out #WVSen
@rebeccagberg What gave ya that idea??
Interesting move by @DonBlankenship, will give him some credit for addressing the people at his event early to keep them in the loop.		"What we’ve seen so far is not encouraging. That doesn’t mean it won’t change, but it’s not encouraging.” he says before taking qs. #WVSen
Messer gives his concession speech for #INSen, lauds the conservative reforms that he's taken part in. “We are disappointed by the result tonight but I wouldn’t take any of it back. It’s been an extraordinary opportunity to be here. Beyond that, onward and upward.”
Pittenger keeps slowly climbing, but will it be enough for him to defeat a candidate that took him to the wire in 2016? https://t.co/D6VbNOTaLX
@DonnyFerguson Oh, definitely can close this gap, it is far from over for a lot of reasons.
Man, does every Republican within a 25 (or more) mile radius of me hope that these #WVSen primary numbers hold, or that the top two doesn't change at least. (Caveat being it is VERY EARLY) https://t.co/N8YvG329xb
Both @CNN and @NBCNews have called #INSen GOP primary for Braun. Big win for the surging outsider, a huge blow to Reps. Rokita and Messer who now find themselves facing (a likely brief) unemployment: https://t.co/SUGFPl3LCm
It is early, but @MelanieLeneghan has 69 less votes for the 2 year term than she does for the #OH12 special election. @Troy_Balderson has 45 votes less. It's so unlikely , but these two votes aren't near each other on the ballot. Possible for two diff candidates to win.
Just now, @DonBlankenship tells @ABC that he apologizes to anyone "legitimately offended" by his "Chinaperson" remarks, but that he doesn't believe that the politicians were actually offended, but instead using faux outrage as a political tool.
Today, @GOPChairwoman when asked if RNC would back @DonBlankenship: "I’m going to support people who are going to support the president’s agenda."		@DonBlankenship now to ABC: "I'm there to support President Trump’s policies regardless of what they've done, what they say.”

OH-12: The next big House special, in well educated/affluent district Ds will challenge. (Includes my favorite wrinkle, TWO VOTES FOR CONGRESS ON SAME BALLOT, so it's possible one candidate wins the special primary to serve for 4 months, diff person wins primary for 2 yr term)
While everyone's looking at #WVSen, there are a TON of interesting races tomorrow including: 	--IN Sen: where another dirty, three way primary threatens to elevate a self-funding outsider		--OH Sen: where Trump-backed rep running against another outsider
Less than 24 hours before the #WVSen GOP primary and we've got @realDonaldTrump issuing the call to buck Blankenship. And @MorriseyWV has shifted his focus from @EvanJenkinsWV to Blankenship. The question is, will that last-minute push keep Blankenship out of first?
But while his rhetoric about McConnell's "China Family," calling his wife a "Chinaperson" and calling McConnell "Cocaine Mitch" seem to be the most polarizing parts of Blankenship's campaign, he's addressing Blankenship's refusal to file a financial disclosure. https://t.co/NCDHcaCFGh

This list includes the following Senate candidates---Messer, Blackburn, Renacci, Cramer and Jenkins; as well as candidate for governor Diane Black. https://t.co/Or8LEGsa6K
@mattsgorman I hope he wins the general election but Tennessee election law lets, like, Peyton Manning cash in his Money in the Bank briefcase to flatten him and take the seat.
Adds that the idea he called Elaine Chao a "chinaperson" isn't racist, says that he's an Americanperson and some are Koreanpersons and others....
Now he's up and Blankenship does not disappoint, as far as controversy. Fox anchors note he tried to wear a "Ditch Mitch" hat to the debate. DB blasts both other candidates for not promising to vote against McConnell for leader.
Blankenship barely gets a word in as Jenkins and Morrisey just try to punch each other in the mouth. Wonder whether this pisses off voters enough to have them go for Blankenship, or if either candidate's attacks break through.... #WVSen
Asked about support from Bannon, Morrisey defends Trump from Bannon's attacks, points to endorsements from people like Cruz and Rand Paul.
Morrisey doesn't say a straight no, but notes "I wasn't the one recruited by the liberal establishment."
Jenkins says McConnell should be owed "a debt of gratitude" for maneuvering to get Neil Gorsuch on the bench. But says "I'm not ruling anybody out, I'm not ruling anybody in."
No one raises their hand when asked if they would vote for Mitch McConnell, yet at least Jenkins and Morrisey have some caveats.
Jenkins is echoing the Pence "Joe voted no" as he riffs on @JoeManchinWV's record, going to be the key rallying cry for whoever wins this primary.
And now @MorriseyWV asked about moving to WV, Morrisey argues that he moved to the state by choice because he loves it, says WV values echoed in how he took on the "absolute wretched excess of the Barack Obama era.”
Next, @DonBlankenship cornered on his conviction relating to the mining explosion, says the "Obama prosecutors made up" the law that got him put in jail.
First up is @EvanJenkinsWV , who is asked how he pushes back against arguments he's part of the establishment. He notes he was the only person on the stage who endorsed Trump ahead of the 2016 primary, says he's now in Congress working with @realDonaldTrump #WVSen

Morrisey: Says attacks on him regarding opiates are unfair, never worked on opiate issues in private sector. Adds that when he became AG, he "did everything imaginable" to fight against addiction.
Jenkins: Blasts the Democratic effort that's targeting him (in the hopes of getting Blankenship through), says they are afraid of him because they know "Evan Jenkins is the only candidate who can beat Joe Manchin in the fall."
A good question to sum up the #WVSen debate: What is the biggest misconception about you. 		Blankenship: No one's stronger on miner safety, Republican push against him shows that he's "doing something right."
@davecatanese Yeah, he was on the stage in earlier debates so was confused. Thank ya.

@leahaskarinam The two best types of races are founding father races/amazing historical names (like this one, or Sam Houston running for Texas AG in 2014), and SAME NAME AS THE PERSON YOU ARE REPLACING (Ruben Hinojosa running to replace Hinojosa).
Renacci bragged when he jumped in that the WH political team had been trying to woo him.		"When the president and the adminsitration calls you to action, it was a pretty compelling moment for me," he said. 		So this isn't surprising, but a nice boost ahead of May 8 primary. https://t.co/UMmvXmzlqJ

The @RogerWicker campaign with a little good cop/bad cop on McDaniel on his #MSSen announcement. https://t.co/Jy3kkc6ak6
So this is quite a quote from McDaniel: 		"The establishment will do anything to maintain their power. They'll say anything, they'll make any accusation...we've seen this in other states and we know how Mitch McConnell likes to behave when he feels threatened--dirty tricks..."
McDaniel is running for Senate against Wicker in Mississippi, another big establishment/anti-establishment primary for the GOP.
TL;DR: His early record had some big anti-gun control votes. More recent record far more in line with party. But he hasn't had a big mea culpa on issue like a Gillibrand, which is keeping activists skeptical.

But in what @NevinsMark called "some Shakespearean tragedy," the once-Democratic frontrunner has been accused of sexual harassment too. So lots of question marks about the future of PA-7, none good for Republicans though.
On the off, off, chance district lines stay the same, Democrats believe this seat is ripe for a flip. Clinton narrowly won his district in '16, and Democrats outperformed significantly in 2017 county elections.
One option is sacrificing his seat by packing it with Democrats, turning this swing district reliably blue, possibly keeping others red. Other option is to redistrict Meehan into a GOP district, allowing him to save some face and say he's retiring to not challenge a colleague.
And even if the allegations (plus fact he used taxpayer money to pay settlement) don't sink him, the PA Supreme Court is forcing the state to redraw congressional districts, which gives GOP-legislature lots of ways to kick him out.
He's done himself no favors by appearing to confirm the substance of many portions of the accusation, referring to the aide in question as his "soul mate" and sharing that he lashed out at her when he found out she had a serious partner.

@shripal734 @JamesArkin This is where this conversation needs to go. I have never and I love duck, so I must. (If you ever make it to Portland, Maine, I had a top 5 sandwich of my life this summer, a pulled duck sandwich from Duckfat).
@shripal734 @JamesArkin It's a question about ratio v. ingredients. I hope the schools will one day teach the controversy.
@shripal734 @JamesArkin But isn't that like saying a McDonalds cheeseburger isn't a burger because it's so much smaller than a 8 oz artisanal burger from somewhere like Duke's? The serving size doesn't change the DNA of the food.
@shripal734 @JamesArkin We need a Select Committee on Soup to determine a proper ratio of broth to accoutrements to define a soup.
@shripal734 @JamesArkin So it's just a serving size question. Bantam King's ramen is chicken broth with shredded chicken, noodles, greens and veggies---just a Japanese version of chicken noodle soup. Just because the deli gives you less doesn't mean it's a different category of food!

Third bet is a successful write-in ballot, which would obviously be quite difficult, but a possibility.
So Republicans appear to have two choices now, stick with Moore and hope he wins, or dump Moore and hope he still wins, throwing us back to ANOTHER special election!
This is important because it makes the question of a write-in ballot so interesting/difficult for Rs. If Moore does drop out (no signs he will), then write in could allow Doug Jones to run up the middle and win if some Rs still vote for Moore. https://t.co/GePO9i2vnh
Just got off the phone with Alabama Sec. State John Merrill, who confirmed that if Moore drops out (big IF) and still wins (because name will still be on ballot), the election is "the election is null and void" and there's another special election for #ALSen.

"I know what the president tweeted, with all do respect to him I think he’s profoundly wrong in his tweet. I’m telling you that from someone who is from Virginia, who watched these races, who watched people lose tonight against opponents who are completely no name." --Taylor
Republican Rep Scott Taylor (Norfolk area) on #VaGov results: "I don't know how you get around that this wasn’t a referendum on the administration, I just don’t. Some of the very divisive rhetoric helped prompted and usher in a really high Democratic turnout in Virginia."

FWIW, Clinton is "very excited" about Feinstein running for reelection.
Says that while she would have won without Comey letter, Russia hack, fake news, "voter suppression" in states like Wis. all played a role.
Starts to rattle off how Comey hurt her poll numbers around PA and led to short loss there.
Argues Comey was under pressure from former and current agents, but unclear how "witting" he was to the larger plan.
Then Clinton's favorite topic, the Comey letter, comes up. She calls Comey letter "proximate cause" of loss of momentum.
Clinton starts by talking Russia, slaps at Trump for not implementing sanctions on Russia, says he's letting Russia get away with meddling.

Obama with a familiar call to Democrats in first stump speech: ignore the polls and vote.  https://t.co/uK8mgocmJX
In case you were wondering, Obama thinks that @TheJudge44 is a "big boy."
With a nod to 2016, Obama: "I don't know if yall noticed that, but you can't take any election for granted." Tells Dems to run thru the tape
Obama chides the "same old politics of division" that he says America should have put to bed. "It's the 21st century, not the 19th."
Good thread with some new nuggets on Bannon's travels/meetings. Includes a Bannon/Kid Rock phone call! https://t.co/FVVAjRoudQ
I might ruin this, but the YouTube comments under this Obama speech are HISTORICALLY polite right now.
Obama goes on to say that it's not enough to "be a highly-successful business person" and run for office. Depends on quality of character.
"I will refer you both to the constitution, as well as to Michelle Obama, to explain why that will not happen."
Obama hits the stump right now for Murphy, the guv candidate in New Jersey who served in his administration. Crowd chants "4 more years!"

@realDonaldTrump But it frustrated some AL Rs when RNC approved $ for NRSC in that primary. So it that could be magnified if POTUS backs a primary.
@realDonaldTrump That, plus the fact no RNC money would be spent on the incumbent, insulates the RNC.
@realDonaldTrump The RNC's role is informal, they only approve the spending to make sure no one busts the coordinated spending caps.
@realDonaldTrump But if POTUS backs a challenger, RNC is put in the awkward spot of deciding whether to OK NRSC $ that could be spent to back the incumbent.
@realDonaldTrump That's easy when everyone's on the same page: RNC grants NRSC the authority to do spend, everyone goes on their way.
@realDonaldTrump But the RNC has informal power to okay certain, limited, NRSC spending on coordinated expenditures ($ spent in consultation w/ campaigns).
@realDonaldTrump The upshot: the RNC, by rule, stays neutral in primaries, but the NRSC backs all incumbents.
A niche campaign finance practice could put RNC in tough spot if @realDonaldTrump decides to back a Senate primary: https://t.co/ZL9I5F7ZIh

@JamesArkin @CahnEmily Good point, appointment changes the calculus for sure.
@CahnEmily Ha true. Don't remember specifically, but I imagine that was an attack against him too.
@CahnEmily Good point--also worth mentioning she won her House seat in 2016. A likely attack for Rs will be that she's leaving the seat already.
Nevada is one of Dems few opportunities for offense in a state Clinton won, while Dems have to defend 10 seats Trump won.
Rosen's announcement makes it clear she's making Trump opposition a centerpiece of her bid. Calls Heller an "enabler" of Trump in statement
Jacky Rosen has announced her Senate bid in Nevada, a big get that Democrats had hoped would run against  Dean Heller.
Many of the states that have been critical of the letter are still saying they'd turn over public info, in line with request. https://t.co/sljT93wlZM

Republicans say they aren't worried, hoping for bloody primaries that relitigate the progressive v. establishment fight.

Atlanta Braves have the bases loaded against the Nats, #GA06 has stopped reporting? Atlanta is really killing me right now.
I will bang this drum all night until it's clear whether this is the decider. Other Dems still at 0.9%, Ossoff could have more of a cushion. https://t.co/dfD4a7Omoq
Certainly not saying it will hit '14 levels. But most predictions I saw were in range of 150k for tonight. https://t.co/MnKe6T0gq9
As others have noted, turnout high in #GA06. Specials typically low turnout, '14 had 210k voters. W/ 53% precincts so far, 140k tonight.
Right now @ossoff is dancing just above the 50 percent mark, follow @thehill here for the twists and turns on #GA06 https://t.co/sBeOtj7d1c
FWIW, the @Nationals are up 3-0 against the @Braves in a suburban Atlanta stadium less than a mile outside of #GA06
Same deal with 46 percent in, bit less than 1 percent. This is with Ossoff at 51 percent #GA04. With those votes, he'd double his cushion. https://t.co/dfD4a7Omoq
Keep up with everything #GA06 here, thanks to the hard work of @LA_Hagen and @willsommer , and the meh work from me: https://t.co/sBeOtj7d1c
