Then we can discuss a solution that provides Dreamers and TPS recipients long-term protections and supports border security through improved infrastructure and manpower at ports of entry and smart technology like drones, radars and sensors.
Democrats have voted nine times to reopen the government and these bills are awaiting action by Senate Leader McConnell. Enact one of these measures, which have previously received bipartisan support, and open the government immediately.
Until the President releases his hostages – federal workers and the American people – there will be no negotiation. End the shutdown now, and we can consider how a compromise giving lasting protections for Dreamers and TPS recipients may lead to a deal on border security.

TY @newsnation for having me on today. I believe last nights #SOTU solidified our base &amp; it's time to find common ground so we can legislate
The strength of our society &amp; the success of our economy depend on a strong middle class. Inspired by last night's #SOTU!
I look forward to helping working families in the 6th Congressional District during the 114th Congress. #SOTU
It’s time to close loopholes that help the wealthiest few and big corporations.  We need to embrace working men and women. #SOTU
Instead of fighting to cut education funding we should be finding ways to make it more affordable.  Congress should work for all people.
I applaud the #FreeCommunityCollege plan for students willing to work hard for good jobs at good wages. #SOTU
The people of the 6th Congressional District would benefit tremendously w/ a rise in the minimum wage. It’s time to pay our workers fairly.
Equal pay for equal work is a no brainer.  I appreciate the President’s push for this and hope Congress will act soon. #SOTU
There are 43 million private-sector workers w/o paid sick leave. Working families deserve the time they need to recover from illnesses.#SOTU
Sick leave for working families is not only good for families, but also good for our economy. #SOTU
I agree w/ the President, we need to lower taxes for working families so we can grow the middle class.
GOP wants a tax plan to help the wealthy.  We must make sure working families, the backbone of our economy, are treated fairly.
Our economy is creating jobs at the fastest pace since 1999 - unemployment rate is lower than it was before the financial crisis. #SOTU

Click here http://t.co/0wNZXrlV, http://t.co/NRX8rLa7, http://t.co/zhD5Hla5 to view my take take fairness.
Tax code must ensure that all Americans pay their fair share and that the burden isn't disproportionately felt by least well off
We need to put people back to work so they can enjoy the dignity of earning a paycheck and pay their fair share.
Our tax code should reflect what we value as a society; current system says we value wealth more than we value work. Fundamentally unfair!
I think it's unfair that the wealthiest among us get the most tax breaks; corporations pay more to their CEOs than they do in taxes.
I believe overarching mission of supercommittee is to find common ground.   Both sides say the current tax code is "fundamentally unfair"
I applaud the ending of the discriminatory 'Don't Ask, Don't Tell' policy.  One step further toward making America a more perfect union.
Happy Hispanic Heritage Month!  Hispanic population up 148% in SC past 10 years; I'm honored to serve you in Congress.

this whole issue of "class warfare"-I've been hearing that all my life. None of this is about class warfare...we want fairness in the system
As I stated in my WaPo op-ed earlier this month, any deficit reduction plan must contain jobs, smart budget cuts and fair revenue measures
The American people need jobs, and they are looking to their leaders to put politics aside and do the right thing for our country.
