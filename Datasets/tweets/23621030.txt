If if you've ever done #Adderall, #Vyvanse, #Dexedrine, or so forth you might even be surprised... and kind of taken aback... by how "smooth", "laid back", "relaxed", or even "chill" the #Methamphetamine experience feels.
Meth is not soluble in acetone, but it is in water, #Methampedmine
#Methampedmine Now drug users are making their own meth in small batches using a faster, cheaper and much simpler method with ingredients that can be carried in a backpack and mixed on the run. This method is easy for the user to make yet very dangerous.
#Methamphetamine The new formula for manufacturing meth: a two-liter bottle, a handful of cold pills and some noxious chemicals. Shake the bottle and you have just produced the world‚Äôs most dangerous and addictive drug
#Cocaine is commonly made from the Coca Plant in South America. It was the most popular drug in the 70's, and the most expensive. In the 80s there was a way found to turn #Cocaine into #Crack. That way it could be distributed to the poorer community.
Meth, sometimes called "the poor man's cocaine," can be made or cooked in about an hour.
#Ephedrine, #Pseudoephedrine, and #Phenylpropanolamine are precursor chemicals used in the illicit manufacture of methamphetamine or amphetamine
