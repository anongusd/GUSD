9/9 See the full interactive from @ashlynstill @grantmeaccess and @Cmkahn: https://t.co/lzJRtldIuw
8/9 To finish up, here's our latest from @Reuters Polling Editor @CmKahn  - according to an Oct. 23-29 Reuters/Ipsos poll: 48 percent of respondents said it was likely that Democrats would take control of the House, 33 percent said not likely and 20 percent didn’t know https://t.co/mfhXHcLyQt
7/9 But @ReutersGraphics can’t predict for certain what’s going to happen on #ElectionDay tomorrow. In 2016, 1 out of every 8 voters made up their minds the week of the election – and a majority of those late deciders picked Trump https://t.co/1rKrQgQ4T6
6/9 SMALL-DOLLAR DONATIONS: Small-dollar contributions to Democrats were up 70% in Sept. compared to the same time in 2014. But small-dollar contributions to Republicans were down more than 10% https://t.co/qrNpejU8Gv
5/9 PRIMARY TURNOUT: Democratic turnout has dwarfed Republican turnout in the gubernatorial primaries. And in five of those races, Democratic turnout increased more than 100% https://t.co/v5bRSQ6ZYh
4/9 POLLING: In competitive districts, registered voters have consistently favored Democrats over Republicans for most of the year. See polling until Sept. here - https://t.co/o7yjS7MJVG
3/9 TOSS-UPS: Of the 55 House races that @Reuters considers truly competitive, 50 are held by Republicans and only five are held by Democrats https://t.co/75LrBnPufm
2/9 OPEN SEATS: It’s generally tougher to beat an incumbent than to win an open race. Since Trump’s election, 56 current House reps – 38 Republicans and 18 Democrats – have called it quits. That’s the most since 1992. https://t.co/e2UC12pEQG
