@yhazony @bungarsargon @jdforward I don‚Äôt think I do it that often. But these jewish political issues are so emotional and intimate that sometimes I just dont know how else to convey my thoughts #ForwardChat
@rabbiandykahn @bungarsargon Very hard to answer because even if I felt israel deserved that in my head my heart would really probably resist. I do worry about large-scale ‚Äútransfer‚Äù if a really bad initifada breaks out #ForwardChat
@bungarsargon @jdforward I don‚Äôt know, honestly. A lot of people are pretty much at mercy of security officials if they want to enter country

@glibcf a lot of people said they were embarrassed by it. maybe the people who approve didn't think it polite to tell me #ForwardChat
@bungarsargon @jdforward no. why should a democracy prevent travelers from participating in protests? #ForwardChat
@yonibak @bungarsargon @jdforward There's actually significant terrorism in W Bank. price tag attacks, for instance. But if u focus on individualized suspicion, then you're on solid ground regardless of which group gets detained more #ForwardChat
@bungarsargon @yonibak @jdforward I actually don't think Israel is distinguishing between the two. Seems to me that they're treating protest, boycott, criticism as a threat #ForwardChat
@bungarsargon @yonibak @jdforward what's the question?
@MAarenau I'm not an expert on airport security. But seems to me that scrutiny should be based on individualized suspicion that someone is going to commit violence or break the law. not political views, religion, ethnicity etc. That's true for US too
@bungarsargon @jdforward of course #ForwardChat
@glibcf @jdforward My guess is that Israel + American Jewish groups have set up an apparatus to keep tabs on "delegitimizers"--a vague term. And people get caught up in this dragnet. Sometimes it backfires but often it works in intimidating people + leading them to stop their activism #ForwardChat
@bungarsargon @jdforward I think my case got a lot more attention than it deserves because I'm a Zionist American Jew with some public profile. What's important is that people report on what happens to non-Jews, non-Zionists, Palestinians etc at Ben Gurion
@ephshalom @bungarsargon @jdforward if Israel wants to support Palestinian parties + leaders who believe in coexistence and nonviolence--say Salam Fayad--it must show that it supports Palestinian state near 67 lines + halt settlement growth. Bibi's policies promote extremism cause they give Palestinians no hope
@IsraelRosenberg I considered it a very pro-Jewish protest since to me defending the rights of the stranger is one of the most fundamental messages of Tanakh
@bungarsargon @netanyahu @jdforward His half-apology is only useful if it creates pressure to change the way Israel deals with the people who endure much more harassment than I did--especially Palestinian, Arab and Muslim travelers. #Forwardchat

@thatpeterfox don't think there's a military answer. Bush tried that w/ Dahlan in 2007. Palestinians need to have the right to vote. If Israel wants Hamas to lose it can show Palestinians that leaders who recognize Israel get real benefits for their people. hasn't done that #ForwardIsraelChat

If Israel's blockade of Gaza is only about security, how come Israel suddenly allowed farmers in Gaza to export palm fronds (lulavim) in 2011 when Israel faced a shortage? https://t.co/Fc8D2TOCdK
Alec--you'll get attacked for this tweet. Don't stop. One of the things that sustains right-wing dominance of the Israel debate is that many non-Jewish progressives are too scared to speak their values. Enter this debate. We need you. https://t.co/EG1mdI5pFv
