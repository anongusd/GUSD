It will be important that Congress continues to monitor and review the president‚Äôs role in this process to ensure the actions taken are within constitutional and statutory authority.
Emergency declarations do not allow the President to circumvent the Constitution. President Trump‚Äôs exercise of national emergency powers is limited. He is not creating a new law or allocating additional funding. He is re-appropriating money already set aside for other projects.
It‚Äôs Congress‚Äô duty to ensure the President is acting within his constitutional authority to address that crisis. After research and consideration, I believe Trump is acting within his authority to take this action.
Emergency declarations should not be taken lightly. President Trump has made a strong case that there‚Äôs a humanitarian crisis at our southern border ‚Äì and I agree.

House Republicans, along with President Trump, are committed to keeping America safe. The President has been clear: securing our border ‚Äî which includes obtaining sufficient funding for the border wall ‚Äî is a non-negotiable priority.
Republicans have made numerous commonsense, reasonable offers to Democrats which would have kept the government open and properly funded but Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer would rather play partisan games and put politics ahead of national security.
Once again, Democrats are putting interests of illegal immigrants above interests of American citizens.
Hoping today brings peace, joy and happiness to you and your loved ones. #MerryChristmas! https://t.co/WVkzA3QVTZ

This legislation simply props up the failed status quo, and I could not support it.
I support funding our military and a number of other provisions in the bill. But we can and should keep our nation strong and secure without requiring irresponsible spending increases, ignoring the deficit, and growing the size of the federal government.
The current process has led to five continuing resolutions in a single fiscal year. This morning, Congress again failed in its responsibility to the American people.
The federal budget process is completely broken. I have spent my first year on the House Budget Committee pushing for reforms to add meaningful enforcement mechanisms and accountability.
@BoyCrazyMama @SpeakerRyan The GOP tax reform bill isn't effective when filing this year's taxes. It will be effective when you file at the beginning of NEXT year.

I'm glad this CR has funding for CHIP, but I will continue to push for community health center (CHC) funding so that my constituents have access to the care they need and deserve.
If Democrats were serious about providing stability for the hundreds of thousands of DACA recipients anxiously awaiting action by Congress, they would vote to fund the government and continue our negotiations. https://t.co/ShR2A3qYQw
Lastly, I have been part of numerous bipartisan discussions over the last few months to improve border security and interior enforcement. A fix for DACA has been included in those discussions.
While this legislation includes lots of good policies, I share the opinion of many of my colleagues that CRs are an imperfect mechanism to fund the federal government. But in the face of a government shutdown, the choice is clear. The American people deserve better.
Our country could lose billions of dollars in economic activity, the health care for millions of children will be jeopardized, and our brave men and women serving in uniform won‚Äôt be guaranteed their next paycheck.
If Democrats shut down the government, millions of federal employees won‚Äôt be able to work and critical federal agencies like the National Institutes of Health will stop their vital work.
It‚Äôs unfortunate that Democratic leadership is now advising its members to walk away from ongoing negotiations to shut down the federal government. https://t.co/ShR2A3qYQw

RT @PASenateGOP: #PASenate #Education Chair @SenatorSmucker: Pensions are #1 school cost but Gov offers no pension reform plan #PABudget
The governor proposed increases spending on head start and pre-k counts programs but not the  early intervention program for IU's.
Secretary of @PADeptofEd Rivera intends to drive out all new spending in 2016/17 budget on education through new Basic Ed Funding Formula.
Secretary of @PADeptofEd Rivera identifies pensions as highest cost driver in education.
The gov. has proposed spending $12b on basic education and $1.7b on higher education. 42% of the total proposed budget for 2016/17.
PA spends on average $15,000 per student between all 500 school districts.
How does PA rank among other 49 states in terms of total spending and spending per student?
Secretary of @PADeptofEd Rivera opens by providing insights on how Dept. has created efficiencies. https://t.co/Z9QuZ725RE
