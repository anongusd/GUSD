It's hard to overstate @laningforwi's impact on Wisconsin politics, and I'm so proud to have worked with her to help turn Wisconsin a lot bluer last November. 		I wish her all the best as she finds the next great thing. — TB https://t.co/JWmyxtLjWy
Guys, there's no need to fight.		All you have to do is stop obstructing plans to reopen the government...		https://t.co/DfOcDPu4PY
Wow, appreciate the enthusiasm! But your money may be better served supporting these organizations helping furloughed workers:		https://t.co/hb20g1xp2l		https://t.co/OJKRgwWdWf		Okay, now Tammy and I are going to get back to work — we've got a government to reopen. https://t.co/s7COmbkOTW
We can discuss it at the next Tammy Caucus, Tammy https://t.co/PxayZAlyRj
I wish the Trump admin had as much compassion for federal workers going without pay as they do the mortgage industry.		@realDonaldTrump, end this shutdown.		https://t.co/vSkG7koSSI
Proud to support Tony, and so very thankful for his leadership. 		Wisconsin can’t just be open for business, it’s got to be open for everyone. 		https://t.co/JMgZWo7zMR
Congratulations to @Tony4WI on officially becoming the 46th governor of Wisconsin today!		I’m excited to work together to fight for all Wisconsinites. https://t.co/THJDOqqtJF
We’re going to have a spirited debate about who the next president should be, and I’m excited by all the new ideas that will be on the table.		But as someone who just lost because his anti-worker agenda, I don’t know that you should be talking about the dignity of hard work. https://t.co/q2rtUPGldY
This year I got to see @sharicedavids, @jaredpolis, @andreaforward8, @kyrstensinema, and more win on their own terms.		That makes it all worth it.		https://t.co/mTAiwn9Rb7
You don’t know the half of it... https://t.co/sjeOPMcIPB
I've watched @ScottWalker put partisanship over people time and again. Today's political power grab is no different.		He is disrespecting voters and undermining the democratic process. 		There's a reason voters chose @Tony4WI. https://t.co/zkmd920csr
Wisconsin elected @Tony4WI &amp; @JoshKaulWI. 		Republicans in the Legislature decided they knew better. 		Today they undermined our democracy and insulted every single WI voter. I’m confident that those same voters will remember that on November 3, 2020. https://t.co/YMdUN80DTu
This isn’t about Republicans being sore losers, this is about them undermining the democratic process and the will of Wisconsin voters.		They should be ashamed.		https://t.co/aqfOCaUU2V
I'll be honest, it's a little weird having an award named after you, but I'm thrilled it's going to a trailblazer like @pwcdanica.		She's an inspiration to me and so many others. https://t.co/XmlSHTqZAu

I can’t get Sandra Parks out of my head this week. Her death is senseless and horrifying.		At a young age, she was already fighting to end gun violence. The world needed Sandra, and gun violence took her from us.		It’s up to us to carry on her mission.		https://t.co/3Ww8nXpOD2
Very happy to say I’m no longer the *only* openly LGBTQ U.S. Senator. 		Congratulations to @kyrstensinema on a well-deserved victory. The upper chamber is lucky to have your steady leadership.
I can’t believe I need to say this, but every vote should be counted everywhere.		Because if you’re scared of every vote being counted, you’re scared of democracy.
I will always stand up for you, and I couldn’t be more grateful to be your Senator for six more years. From the bottom of my heart: thank you, Wisconsin. https://t.co/65lNxtB8ia
It was about the millions of Wisconsinites who went to the polls because they weren’t about to let the special interests buy a Senate seat.
It was about the students who called BS on inaction from Congress to enact commonsense gun safety legislation. It was about the retirees who are working to get the full pension they’ve earned.
It was about Roddy and folks like him at Neenah Foundry — and all American workers who should have a fair shot to get ahead.
It was about Bert, Emily, Brandi, and all the farmers who work day-in and day-out, but are seeing their markets for milk disappear.
It was about Chelsey and Zoe. Jenny and Cas. Tara, Maren, Anna, and all the Wisconsin parents who need health care that’s there for their children — regardless of a pre-existing condition.
This win wasn’t about me — it was about all of you. https://t.co/dGAkkG5XnC
.@ScottWalker has served Wisconsin for many years, and I thank him for that service.		Now, it’s time to come together to support @Tony4WI, @TheOtherMandela, @JoshKaulWI, and @SarahforWI who are ready to lead us forward.
I just called our next Governor of Wisconsin, Tony Evers, to congratulate him on his victory.		I am so grateful to have him as a partner to make sure we can put hardworking Wisconsinites first at every level of government.

There’s no hiding from her long record of finding every way possible to fight for insurance companies while selling out sick Wisconsinites. So, it might be best if @LeahVukmir owns up to it, because no one is buying her lies. 10/10

Mike Pence came to Wisconsin and said with @LeahVukmir in the Senate, they would try to repeal the ACA again, which would gut protections for the millions of people with pre-existing conditions. Vukmir hasn’t said anything to the contrary. 6/ 		https://t.co/Pi20Yk0hjn
When she endorsed the AHCA (in an ALEC press release) she said it would “loosen… requirements.” The same requirements that make sure protections aren’t gutted for the millions of people with pre-existing conditions. 5/

“Who do you trust on health care?” — @LeahVukmir #wisen https://t.co/aZiPOwoXib
Federal student loans support the dreams of thousands on thousands of Americans who are working to build a better life for themselves. @LeahVukmir says, “too bad.” #wisen https://t.co/L0WLMlKXsv
Tonight @LeahVukmir called Tammy’s grassroots team “special interest donors.” That only makes sense if you think accessible health care is a “special interest.”		By the way, you can become one of Tammy’s “special interest” donors too: https://t.co/HmgR8FTa8D https://t.co/fPGJU0pvxq
Why are billionaires like the Koch brothers and Richard Uihlein spending millions to beat Tammy? Because they want a Senator who will work for them, not hardworking Wisconsinites. #wisen https://t.co/2NZ3Ci3wLd
Under @LeahVukmir’s plan, just 1% of Wisconsinites with pre-existing conditions were covered. They were forced into six-month waiting periods. And they faced lifetime caps for care. 		Vukmir wants to take Wisconsinites back to those days. #wisen https://t.co/MMN0a4KqTj
The economy is working for some people — the rich, the powerful special interests — you know, the folks @LeahVukmir works for. Tammy doesn’t work for them. #wisen https://t.co/oV8o1SeWqO
Wisconsin, you have a choice this November. Someone who will stand up for you and your families, or someone who stands with the big insurance companies, the special interests, and the rich and powerful on Wall Street. 		The choice could not be more clear: Tammy Baldwin. #wisen https://t.co/Rey6cgXgN6
.@LeahVukmir just asked, "Who will you trust on health care?"		It's not the the candidate who voted with insurance companies to not cover oral chemo and has vowed to gut pre-existing condition protections. #wisen
Tammy was honored to work with Jason’s parents, Marv and Linda, and Jason’s widow, Heather, to pass Jason’s Law and make sure no veteran suffers from overprescribing at the VA ever again. #wisen https://t.co/Bkb97dS6vi
Politicizing Jason's death is shameful, and @LeahVukmir should be ashamed. #wisen https://t.co/1tYQVQ6dyv
.@LeahVukmir has made it clear that she won't stand up for what's right for Wisconsin... or just plain what's right. She'd be nothing but a rubber stamp.
Even his awful comments about women?
You stand by him mocking a disabled reporter?
You're okay with barring patriotic Americans from serving in the military?
What about standing on the international stage and praising Putin, who interfered in our elections?
How about families cruelly being separated at the border?
Really, @LeahVukmir? Is there anything you'll stand up to @realDonaldTrump about?		What about starting a trade war with our allies that hurt Wisconsin farmers? Or his call for a Harley boycott? #wisen
Tammy's worked across the aisle to strengthen border security and create a path to citizenship. It's simple — @LeahVukmir wants to play politics, Tammy wants a solution that puts Wisconsin first. #wisen https://t.co/Gu0UlEQGDA
.@LeahVukmir just can't stop lying. On immigration reform she's lying too. #wisen https://t.co/fzkssm4cRl
Time and time again, @LeahVukmir has shown who she really works for: her special interest funders. Tammy’s never going to put the corporate special interests above her constituents — that’s a promise. #wisen https://t.co/rqGR8bfRy2
.@LeahVukmir is so in the pocket of ALEC that she took a bill that reduced nursing home safety and tried to put it into law. #wisen https://t.co/8Eo9v6AS9d
While Tammy's working to make higher education more affordable and accessible, @LeahVukmir has been making it harder every step of the way. #wisen https://t.co/0jLoP3guNS
By introducing legislation that would let folks refinance their student loans, Tammy’s working to help Wisconsinites crushed by debt. #wisen https://t.co/7AlEba6PSQ
.@LeahVukmir is not looking out for Wisconsin students. #wisen https://t.co/lBOaTLcGxV
We’ve got some incredibly skilled workers in Wisconsin — and now, they’re training the next generation of students. Tammy’s PARTNERS Act will help expand Wisconsin’s top-notch apprenticeship programs and help more people like Liam get ahead. #wisen https://t.co/FcUmg6Ow40
.@LeahVukmir supported the GOP tax plan that gave the vast majority of benefits to the very wealthy. And now she wants to pay for it by cutting the Social Security and Medicare benefits hardworking Wisconinites earned. That's just backwards. #wisen https://t.co/Ykkw2tigdz
Corporations are passing their gift from the GOP tax law to their wealthy shareholders through stock buybacks instead of rewarding the folks creating that value — workers. Tammy thinks that's wrong. #wisen https://t.co/bC64QLbFbM
Did you know that @LeahVukmir wants to abolish the Department of Education and doesn't really have a plan for what comes next? #wisen
Mitch McConnell said THIS WEEK that he wants to cut Social Security and Medicare. And @LeahVukmir is raring to go to the Senate and vote to take away your earned benefits. #wisen
Taxpayers now face trillions of dollars of burden from the GOP tax bill. And @LeahVukmir wants to cut programs like Social Security and Medicare to pay for it. #wisen https://t.co/OGMaMmqAvT
What Leah's talking about was 1) too expensive 2) too hard to access and 3) covered way too few Wisconsinites. #wisen https://t.co/f5ilxWthzf

When it comes to health care, the choice couldn't be clearer. #wisen https://t.co/doUODp2Igg
It's simple: @LeahVukmir would be https://t.co/0n9c5Yd97f to gut protections for pre-existing conditions. #wisen https://t.co/JsKNPeDAAU
Mike Pence said it. Mitch McConnell said it. And @LeahVukmir's said it — if she wins she's casting the deciding vote to gut protections for pre-existing conditions. That's what's on the line. #wisen https://t.co/daJ0lgqjuk
While @realDonaldTrump is here, hopefully he can talk @LeahVukmir into supporting #BuyAmerican policies that invest in American workers. #wisen
No wonder @LeahVukmir supports the GOP tax plan that gives 83% of its benefits to the top 1%. Those are her special interest backers. #wisen https://t.co/zggRREeaWB

.@LeahVukmir can’t stop lying about my record. I’ve always fought to make health care more affordable &amp; accessible.

Health care is the reason Tammy entered public service — and it’s what’s on the line this November. She knows what it’s like to be denied coverage for a pre-existing condition.		We cannot let @LeahVukmir take us back to those days. #wisen #wbadebate https://t.co/NlnIFk6Kgt
Wow, even when pressed @LeahVukmir can’t think of a single thing she disagrees with @realDonaldTrump? Not even the tweets?

Nothing is going to stop Tammy from standing up for Wisconsinites. @LeahVukmir, on the other hand, will do and say anything if it means winning a Senate seat for her special interest backers.		The winner of this debate and the right choice for Wisconsin: Tammy. #wisen #wbadebate https://t.co/AqAYrIgNkG

Like most other gun owners, Tammy supports common sense reform to our gun laws. And she's not afraid to stand up to the corporate special interests to make it happen. #wisen #wbadebate https://t.co/MUcxIRDUyH
There are common sense solutions to curbing gun violence. But instead of advocating for reforms that would save lives, @LeahVukmir is following the lead of her NRA donors. Shameful. #wisen #wbadebate https://t.co/D1C2bdCdSG
This is what @LeahVukmir had to say about families tragically being separated at the border. Heartless. #wisen #wbadebate https://t.co/mfiFsLvGnM
It's no secret that our immigration system is broken. Tammy's worked across the aisle to make bipartisan, comprehensive immigration reform a reality. #wisen #wbadebate https://t.co/R75PsAeIH0
How extreme is @LeahVukmir? Her anti-choice positions would outlaw common forms of birth control and in vitro fertilization. #wisen #wbadebate
Women should have the freedom to make their own health care choices, and that's what Tammy has always fought for. #wisen #wbadebate https://t.co/oxUyD4O3B4

Get your facts straight, @LeahVukmir. Tammy asked to meet with Justice Kavanaugh 7️⃣ times before he was confirmed to the Supreme Court. The White House never responded. #wisen #wbadebate https://t.co/nif4kev6Qo
Justice Kavanaugh was hand-picked from a list put together by the special interests to do their bidding. Tammy voted 'no' on his nomination because Wisconsinites need a Supreme Court Justice who will work for them. #wisen #wbadebate

Tammy's childhood illness meant her grandparents couldn’t get her health care — at any price. The provisions she fought for in the Affordable Care Act guaranteed that no parent or grandparent has to go through that again. We can't go back. #wisen #wbadebate https://t.co/5af2Ij3N7c
From lawsuits to repeals to new regulations, @LeahVukmir has supported every effort she could to go back to the days when coverage for folks with pre-existing conditions wasn't protected #wisen #wbadebate https://t.co/2x3QPkTm12

I was honored to receive @DAVHQ’s Outstanding Senate Legislator of the Year award earlier this year. Let’s continue to make sure Washington works for Wisconsin’s veterans. Thank you for having me at your forum! https://t.co/x6etSo49QS
At @DAVHQ Wisconsin Fall Conference in Stevens Point this afternoon! I am proud to be working with DAV to do right by Wisconsin’s veterans. #KeepThePromise https://t.co/5p8q2iLrCx
“I have a consistent record of opposing insurance mandates”		That’s what @LeahVukmir said when she voted against covering oral chemo for cancer patients. For Leah, keeping costs low for her special interest backers is more important than keeping costs down for sick Wisconsinites https://t.co/QE5e9oqMev
In Wisconsin — America’s Dairyland — farmers drive our economy forward and unite our rural communities.		I’m proud to stand with Wisconsin farmers on #NationalFarmersDay and every day! https://t.co/V7J7BmAmAY

Meanwhile, the folks fighting back with me are giving $1️⃣9️⃣ online grassroots gifts. 		And if anyone wants to join us, we’d love to have you ➡️ https://t.co/REZivQuwg9
Speaking of special interests, you’ve benefitted from the more than $1️⃣4️⃣0️⃣0️⃣0️⃣0️⃣0️⃣0️⃣ in outside spending to beat me. They’re desperate for you to be elected, @LeahVukmir.
Let’s be honest @LeahVukmir, you just want to take us back to the days when your insurance company pals wrote the rules.
Junk plans can charge more or deny coverage to people with pre-existing conditions. And as a reminder, 2️⃣4️⃣0️⃣0️⃣0️⃣0️⃣0️⃣ Wisconsinites have pre-existing conditions. The only plan you’ve ever had covered just 2️⃣2️⃣0️⃣0️⃣0️⃣ of them. https://t.co/y2eWP8J57i
1️⃣ @LeahVukmir, you spoke out against my plan to protect folks with pre-existing conditions just yesterday		2️⃣ You’re literally backed by the Koch brothers https://t.co/29vUrMmFkR
Think about the people in your life with a pre-existing condition. Now think about how wrong it is that @LeahVukmir wants to make it harder for them to get health care. 		The choice is clear. https://t.co/3Rl8JFr04v
Wisconsin’s seniors want a Senator who will stand up for their earned benefits, protect Social Security and Medicare, and support family caregivers. They know they’ve got that in Tammy!		If you agree, join Seniors for Tammy here: https://t.co/vHLNLfvyOr https://t.co/E8m0K20dbi
Have you heard? @BernieSanders is coming back to Wisconsin for an early vote rally!		RSVP here: https://t.co/9eQeIYqIv2 https://t.co/mNxOhRccYo
The last time @mike_pence was in Wisconsin, he admitted that with @LeahVukmir in the Senate, he’ll try to repeal the #ACA again. 		Today, he’s back in Wisconsin fundraising for Leah. What am I up to? Forcing a vote to protect quality health care. https://t.co/Pi20Yk0hjn
I’m not going to stand idly by and let the Trump administration swindle folks out of their health care. That’s why I’m forcing a vote to overturn the expansion of junk insurance plans. 		https://t.co/pavS0GljAs
Health care is what brought Tammy to public service. She’s working hard to make it more affordable and accessible. 		Actions speak louder than words, @LeahVukmir. And you’ve been in the pockets of the insurance companies every step of the way. https://t.co/t06aN7HMTP
And Sandy Pasch thinks @LeahVukmir’s record, from voting against coverage for cover oral chemotherapy, to supporting efforts to gut protections for pre-existing conditions, speaks for itself. She knows that Tammy is the one standing up for patients. https://t.co/QuaPIdPB7x
.@DavidCCrowley has seen what happens when Leah Vukmir takes orders from ALEC corporate lobbyists. Wisconsinites need a Senator who will fight for them, not take orders from special interests. https://t.co/BPKDccJdeb
Praise has been pouring in for Tammy after her #WISenDebate performance last night:		Medal of Honor recipient Gary Wetzel knows what it’s like to risk everything for our country — and why it’s important to have someone on the side of veterans in the Senate. He knows that's Tammy. https://t.co/Md1op0X2hO
Grabbed coffee at Miss Katie’s with @AdriennePed this morning! Tune into @WISN12News soon to catch our interview. https://t.co/WrbkWFuArn
In tonight’s #WISenDebate, @LeahVukmir showed who she really works for — insurance companies, corporate special interests, and her rich and powerful backers.		And Tammy demonstrated who she works for: hardworking Wisconsin families. The choice couldn’t be clearer. https://t.co/rY60meeyWk
.@LeahVukmir, hundreds of thousands of Wisconsinites with pre-existing conditions know you’re not telling the truth when you say they were covered before the ACA.		You can’t hide your record of standing up for insurance companies instead of sick Wisconsinites. #wisen #WISenDebate https://t.co/RPbCdiYsEA
How does @LeahVukmir want to pay for the trillions of dollars in taxpayer burden created by the GOP’s handouts to her corporate backers? Cuts to the programs those same taxpayers depend on. 		And she’s got nothing to say for herself. #wisen #WISenDebate https://t.co/BSi5fReI6S
“I keep asking how many more Parklands? How many more Newtowns? How many more Oak Creeks … before we will stand up to the NRA and corporate interests and say: Let’s go with common sense safety regulation”		It seems like for @LeahVukmir, no number is too high. #wisen #WISenDebate https://t.co/h5vYEQ6A7c
“A vote is a vote.” 		And, @LeahVukmir voted with insurance companies to prevent oral chemo from being covered. She can’t just run away from that. #wisen #WISenDebate https://t.co/9rtKvklv4Y
Show your support for Tammy, and vote now! #wisen #WISenDebate https://t.co/LEgDzPaRo7
Tammy's standing up for you, Wisconsin #wisen #WISenDebate https://t.co/U2ztNc6XWC
The millions in special interest money that @LeahVukmir is referring to are Tammy's grassroots donations (with an online average gift of $19). 		You can donate here: https://t.co/YS4QdmrsnW
Leah is endorsed by the NRA, who want to put more guns in our schools and reject any commonsense reform. 		Once again, she's putting special interests before what's right for Wisconsin. #wisen #WISenDebate
Tammy supports buying and hiring American. @LeahVukmir disagrees. #wisen #WISenDebate https://t.co/4h9rCQlcx6
Over 300 dairy farms have closed this year — Wisconsin farmers don't have time to wait around. They need trade deals, not trade wars #wisen #WISenDebate

.@LeahVukmir is using a Wisconsin hero's death for political gain and she should absolutely be ashamed. https://t.co/pXImYZm2FS
Tammy believes women should have the freedom to make her own personal decisions about her health care, her family, and her body. She’s proud to be endorsed by @ppact! #wisen #WISenDebate https://t.co/Hv21tpu9Nq
.@LeahVukmir is on the national board of ALEC. They gave her at least 24 models bills that she introduced. And they're pretty horrific. Like repealing equal pay legislation in Wisconsin. #wisen #WISenDebate https://t.co/6skE7wmcga
The tax bill @LeahVukmir supports puts trillions of dollars of burden on taxpayers. How does she want to pay for it? With cuts to programs like Social Security and Medicare #wisen #WISenDebate https://t.co/x86zNI1y7N
The Vukmir-backed GOP tax bill gives 83% of benefits to the top 1%.		Tammy believes tax reform should support Wisconsin’s middle class families — not billionaires and big corporations. #wisen #WISenDebate https://t.co/LNTHfJzr0h
.@LeahVukmir supports the GOP tax plan that gives over 80% of its benefits to the top 1% (you know... her special interest backers) #wisen #WISenDebate https://t.co/KqVUVwWrka
Try again, @LeahVukmir. Tammy has the best voting attendance record in the Wisconsin Congressional Delegation #wisen #WISenDebate https://t.co/vy0kCeL9W8
Leah Vukmir watched as families were being torn apart and said it was, "...a process that has to be upheld." #wisen #WISenDebate
Tammy's worked across the aisle to strenghten border security and create a path to citizenship. And then Donald Trump walked away. It's simple — @LeahVukmir wants a political attack, Tammy wants a solution. #wisen #WISenDebate https://t.co/ZsrQGPPsIi
When @LeahVukmir had the chance to do the right thing and make insurance companies do their job, she refused and voted for oral chemo patients to keep paying their own way. Shameful. #wisen #WISenDebate https://t.co/gCKrOLV99G
Tammy's childhood illness meant her grandparents couldn’t get her health care — at any price. The provisions she fought for in the  Affordable Care Act guaranteed that no parent or grandparent has to go through that again. We can't go back. #wisen #WISenDebate https://t.co/nW6VozeQEZ
.@LeahVukmir has supported just about every effort out there to take us back to the days when having a pre-existing condition meant you couldn't get health care #wisen #WISenDebate https://t.co/28PoOwcZ6p
Health care is what brought Tammy to public service, and she's not going to let anyone get in the way of the care Wisconsinites need. #wisen #WISenDebate https://t.co/RntbWxhy2R

Here's what our campaign manager, @Scott_Spector, has to say about the first #WISenDebate: https://t.co/mgwSEq0ZJg
.@LeahVukmir needs to give us answers on:	❌ Gutting protections for 2.4 million Wisconsinites with pre-existing conditions	❌ Voting against a bipartisan bill to cover oral chemo	❌ Doing the bidding of a shadowy special interest group at the expense of hardworking Wisconsinites
Tonight's #WISenDebate will show the stark difference between Tammy, a Senator who's standing up for Wisconsin, and @LeahVukmir, who's standing with special interests.
And while outside groups are pumping millions of dollars in ads to take Tammy down, folks are fighting back online an average of $19 at a time. Give $19 today to help Tammy in the final stretch: https://t.co/5fNWtDwJLC https://t.co/cS8LwYbmkU
Folks are giving what they can, when they can, to beat back over $14,000,000 in outside spending — this quarter, they did that over 140,000 times. https://t.co/Zw1PZaDpkl

At @NookNorske, Jerry is as proud of his employees as he is of his pies. But before the Affordable Care Act, his workers were being crushed by high medical bills — one even lost her home. 		Jerry never wants that to happen again. That’s why he’s with Tammy. https://t.co/yoZpmm7U90
We both know that’s untrue.		And if you want to talk about seniors: Why did you vote to weaken nursing home protections, push to end SeniorCare, and endorse a tax cut that went largely to the wealthiest Americans and could put Social Security and Medicare on the chopping block? https://t.co/oy2JhHLNyv
.@LeahVukmir, you must be confusing our positions. Because I’m not the one trying to undermine health care for 2 million Wisconsinites with pre-existing conditions, impose an age tax on seniors, and sell folks health care they can’t actually use. https://t.co/gkl5U1Fa4F

I’ve heard too many stories of folks being denied coverage and living in fear of getting sick before the Affordable Care Act. If @LeahVukmir were in the Senate, she’d put the health care of millions of Wisconsinites at risk. 		https://t.co/EWBhqguFdV
Yep, you read that right. Some Wisconsinites won’t be able to turn on the TV and watch the @Packers tomorrow — they’ll see the Vikings instead. It’s time to pass the #GoPackGo Act! 		https://t.co/YoGiJHbYBq
Thank you Shannon for sharing your story with us! We need to make sure every Wisconsinite can get the care they need — regardless of a pre-existing condition. — TB https://t.co/u97WrjgfEO
Health care is on the ballot this November. As a nurse, and as a mom, and as a breast cancer survivor — we can’t trust @LeahVukmir to stick up for Wisconsinites. https://t.co/5PefDRIAW2
What if it comes back? What if I can’t beat it this time? What would happen to my family?		They’re scary questions. The one question we shouldn’t have to add to the pile is: “How can I pay for health care if I get sick again?”
Okay, I’m about to call it a day. I want to say thanks for following along. But before I go I wanted to say one more thing. Here’s the thing about cancer, even when you beat it — you’re always a little bit scared.
Tammy’s also leading the fight against “junk insurance.” If you don’t know about junk insurance, it’s a thing only big insurance companies and @LeahVukmir seem to like — health plans that don’t have to pay for actual health care. 		https://t.co/8fBzfFoOwx
Tammy Baldwin has done so much for people like me. She’s the person who pushed to make sure the Affordable Care Act covered pre-existing conditions.		Because she’s also had a pre-existing condition, and knows what it’s like. 		https://t.co/m0hMrmvO8u
As a nurse, @LeahVukmir must have seen the same things I have, and she still wants to make it harder for people to get the treatment they need. 		https://t.co/1fK3jsdxpw
We don’t like to brag on ourselves much in Wisconsin, but I’m proud to be a nurse. I like getting to know people and being someone they can count on when they are sick and hurt.
Thanks for taking the time to write me @LeahVukmir. Here’s my response: https://t.co/ZC6mWSuCsY
They can be lifechanging, and they’re also expensive to pay out-of-pocket. 		Which is why I think it’s a shame that @LeahVukmir voted against insurance companies having to cover them. Who would do that to a kid?		https://t.co/RkiZCf2XjI
Have you seen those videos of kids hearing for the first time with cochlear implants? I won’t lie… they make me tear up a little bit. Do yourself a favor and watch this one.		https://t.co/OhLs2ULbLS
.@LeahVukmir’s also taken a lot of money from special interests who want her to have these positions. 		I’ve got a pre-existing condition. And a 7 year old. I can’t trust someone who puts these corporations before my family. 4/4 		https://t.co/rsiSvsYtGJ
That’s why @LeahVukmir worries me. She’s said time and time again that she would repeal the Affordable Care Act and the protections for coverage for people like me with it. And they’re saying if she wins they’ll try again. 3/ 		https://t.co/N4jGQnMvph
As a nurse, I remember the days when that meant people couldn’t get health care. I’d see families who were wondering if they could afford life-saving medical treatment. We just can’t go back to that. 2/
About 1 in 8 Wisconsin women will get diagnosed with breast cancer in their lives. I got diagnosed in 2009. But even after I recovered, I was left with another hardship — the words “pre-existing condition.” 1/

Mike is one of the very first voters in Wisconsin for the general election. The most important issue for him? Health care. https://t.co/UyWhZRMUUl
The plan you’re talking about covered less than 1% of the Wisconsinites who now have pre-existing conditions. The fact is, @LeahVukmir wants to take us backwards to when insurance companies wrote the rules. https://t.co/rs3y5t5cuR
Then why did you support Graham-Cassidy, which would have totally undone the very protections Mike is talking about? https://t.co/qPAqyfWGO5
Wisconsinites need folks who will stand up to the big insurance companies and fight for protections for pre-existing conditions. Thank you to @JoshKaulWI for standing with us. https://t.co/ZOycV7uuKL

.@Shrader4WI is what public service is all about — he put his life on the line as a Marine during Operation Desert Storm, and now he’s running for State Assembly to keep giving back. I’m proud to support him! https://t.co/tGFuBSVbCj
Stopped in Dodgeville for a mid-afternoon pick-me-up! https://t.co/cgKhR7ZKMK
Wisconsin’s first responders have been busy — they’ve been working hard to support residents after this summer’s flooding. I had a chance to thank some of them in Darlington this afternoon. https://t.co/piGlPcr6Ma
Folks in Lafayette County are ready to elect Democrats up and down the ticket this November — and now they have a new home base to help them do just that. Congratulations on your office! https://t.co/esKzdF62W8
Thanks to the Monroe Optimists for letting me help cook up some curds! https://t.co/qotgFroeDM
I always love being in Green County because it shows how cheesemaking isn’t just a booming business — it’s an art and a culture! The parade put on by the Swiss Colony is an added bonus. https://t.co/mnuEDm6I0i

One of the issues I kept hearing in our discussion was the racial disparity in maternal mortality. Black women have a 3-4 times higher risk of death from pregnancy-related causes than white women. That is just wrong, and it’s why I’m working to pass the Maternal CARE Act. https://t.co/f4JS2EhPnK
While I was in Milwaukee this afternoon, I took some time to meet with inspiring young leaders from the African American community. They are the people who will take Wisconsin into the future — we need Washington to start listening to them. https://t.co/vwA6eBBKiH
If you want to know more about his heroism, you have to read his Medal of Honor citation, because his bravery and sacrifice are truly beyond belief: https://t.co/6bCSDr4YBZ
This is my friend Gary, and that around his neck is the Medal of Honor. He’s a genuine American (and Wisconsin) hero, and I am beyond humbled by his support. https://t.co/FcOZ7LNEiI
It was an honor to be joined by Bob, Kathy, and veterans from every military branch and from across the state this morning to launch Veterans for Tammy! Thank you for your service and for your support. https://t.co/45HTTcBVYg
“As a doctor who has cared for both active service Airmen and veterans living here in Wisconsin, I know that when it comes to our health care, Tammy has our back.”		— Dr. Kathy Hartke, U.S. Air Force https://t.co/aKg7QoO2l8
“For me, The Helicopter War monument is a testimony to what Tammy Baldwin does: she listens to us veterans; she works across party lines and builds consensus — she gets real results.”		— Bob Hesselbein, U.S. Air Force https://t.co/SCm4YuivNr
Our veterans, our servicemembers and our military families have all sacrificed for our freedom. From health care to good-paying jobs to community support — it is our duty to make sure they are treated like the heroes they are. https://t.co/twKRONvWxK
We need to #SaveLWCF and make sure Wisconsin’s hunters and fishers can enjoy our state’s natural beauty for generations to come! https://t.co/7pH3OJdi72
From Washington to Little Suamico, health care experts know the last thing we need in our system is more chaos. We’ve got to stop this sabotage and start making our health care system work for everyone.		https://t.co/lFDfcKXtFN
Let me tell you about Diane. She’s lived with MS for 23 years. When her medication topped $678,000, she was forced to make the impossible choice between managing her illness or going bankrupt. She stopped taking it.		There's nothing moral about that. 		https://t.co/UsWpAJePO1

Wausau has one of the largest communities of Hmong Americans per capita in the entire country. Yesterday afternoon, I took some time to talk with Hmong leaders in Wausau about how we can all work together to strengthen Wisconsin’s Hmong communities. https://t.co/pWhCwpxCjA
Thanks to our volunteers for diving in and getting to work for Democrats across our state. https://t.co/rtnUOcfhtC
What I remember most from #September11 is what came in the hours and days after the attacks: America coming together. We put aside differences and found what connected us — a love of country and neighbor.		In the wake of tragedy, we found unity. 		https://t.co/GRFudQYcnI
Today, @LeahVukmir stood by this vote. She still thinks folks who need oral chemotherapy should be paying their own way, rather than making her insurance company pals do their job.		That’s just indefensible. https://t.co/JCmzxATQF4
We can’t let them slow us down — show Leah and her shady backers that you’re going to stand up to them and vote this November. 		Register to vote here: https://t.co/Trrwq1L4Jd
And @LeahVukmir’s taken that ideology to Wisconsin. She was described as “gleeful” and “frothing at the mouth” about the idea of passing laws that make it harder for people to vote. 		https://t.co/vXXsoK4UKg
This quote is from a guy who founded the shadowy organization @LeahVukmir sits on the national board of. https://t.co/M7xo1IsNrp

I have been blown away by the number of people who have stepped forward to tell their own family stories about addiction. Thank you to all who submitted a quilt square. We need to show folks that they’re not alone. https://t.co/5Cw6uBrTwd
Thank you, Bev, for including my mom in one of your “Faces of Addiction” quilts. This disease has connected us, but our commitment to end addiction is an even stronger bond. https://t.co/dmYrhfa09r

When you find out it’s #NationalBeerLoversDay: https://t.co/vWadihRMZE
I’ve met some outstanding apprentices across our state — but we need more of them! Let’s make sure manufacturers have the skilled workers they need to keep on growing and pass the PARTNERS Act. 		https://t.co/Jr6DhjGjwF
They didn’t poll me, but I have to agree. We need real action to hold Big Pharma accountable — not tweet storms and shoutfests. It's past time to pass the FAIR Drug Pricing Act and finally get the job done for Wisconsin families. 		https://t.co/WoMTCjSwS0
Folks are getting involved with our race because they’ve seen what’s at stake for young people, people of color, and members of the LGBTQ community. They’re saying, “I’m part of the answer.”		RT if you’re ready to be part of the answer, too.		https://t.co/IvRvNd7hld
We’re fighting back against millions of dollars in outside spending the only way we know how: grassroots donors giving what they can, when they can. 		Help us keep on fighting back: https://t.co/08nKa46gfj 		https://t.co/N85Kyx29jD
No one should be worried sick that anyone in their family will be denied coverage or face lifetime caps in their futures. That’s not the Wisconsin way.		https://t.co/JFzl9p21Kx
I don’t have enough characters in this tweet to tell you all the things that could make you uninsurable because of a “pre-existing condition” if @LeahVukmir gets her way. https://t.co/n0dKir0bEc
Last year, Tara said she wished every Senator voting on #ACA repeal would tell her how much her kids were worth. I told her that they are priceless. 		@LeahVukmir — you say you would have voted to repeal the Affordable Care Act. What would you have told Tara? https://t.co/rf5osNiUws
A case to overturn the Affordable Care Act (and pre-existing condition protections) is being heard in Federal Court today. 		And @LeahVukmir called it a “necessary step.” 		I’m sorry, but the only folks this is “necessary” for are her special interest backers.
When corporate boards choose stock buybacks and CEO bonuses over the health of a company and its employees, there is a serious problem. We need to rein in stock buybacks. We need to reward work. And we need to give workers a seat at the table. 		https://t.co/FIvQsz7XMZ
To all the students and teachers across Wisconsin, happy first day of school! Good luck to all the students starting out the new year, and thank you to the educators who work tirelessly to support families and communities across our state! https://t.co/Kf1gyb8N9a
Yesterday afternoon, folks came out in the rain to demand action on behalf of Wisconsin’s working families. Today, I’m heading back to Washington to get the job done. https://t.co/7kXHquuTl4
Finished off my day celebrating our labor community at Laborfest in Madison this afternoon! Now it’s back to Washington to make sure we pass laws that restore the dignity of hard work for all Wisconsinites. https://t.co/jvOV2t2Lyu
If the labor movement has taught us anything, it’s that there’s strength in numbers. The folks I met at Milwaukee’s Laborfest showed me that no special interests can compete with the strength of Wisconsin’s workers! https://t.co/ZQzBgPPamj
From top to bottom, the Democratic ticket is on the side of Wisconsin’s workers! This afternoon, I was joined by a champion for Wisconsin’s workers and the next governor of Wisconsin, @Tony4WI, at Laborfest! https://t.co/s7hN3rCHzx
It’s always a good day when I get to share the stage with @Gwen4Congress — and even better when we’re talking about how we can support our labor brothers and sisters! https://t.co/10BtaCPAS7
Here in Wisconsin, workers have fought for the recognition of the dignity of hard work. I’m honored to be celebrating #LaborDay in Milwaukee with my brothers and sisters in the labor community! https://t.co/aCZPQZHyOc
I’ve met a lot of folks who @LeahVukmir’s backers called “union thugs,” and I’ve got to tell you: they are some of the hardest working people I know. 		I am proud to stand with Wisconsin workers on #LaborDay and every day. 5/5 https://t.co/xxrWOwWPyr
America’s roads and bridges need rebuilding, and I want to see them rebuilt using American iron, American steel, and American workers. When we add jobs here in America, hardworking people are able to support their families and their local economies. 4/ https://t.co/XPBErLhDx8
Smart, dedicated business leaders have started apprenticeship programs to support the next generation of workers — and I want more Wisconsinites to have the opportunity to be part of it. That’s why I introduced the PARTNERS Act. 3/ https://t.co/XcSuBKJXOm
The Wisconsin Committee to Protect Pensions started when thousands of workers — some in their 70s and 80s — were told their hard-earned pensions were going to be cut. I’m working with these folks to pass the #ButchLewisAct to make sure they get every penny they’ve earned. 2/ https://t.co/qAG6dDlpoz
A few months ago, some of @LeahVukmir’s biggest supporters took to the airwaves and called Wisconsin teachers, workers, and fire fighters, “union thugs.” Well, Leah, I think #LaborDay is a perfect time for you to meet some of them. 1/
This #LaborDay, I hope you’ll join me in recommitting to Wisconsin workers and fighting to do right by them. Together, we can work to overcome special interests’ grip on Washington and win for working families. 		https://t.co/2eYCU3iINn
Rain can’t stop the Sheboygan Democrats! Thanks to everyone who came out to say ‘hi’ at the fair! https://t.co/mYYHWM9HS9

Denise knocked on every door in Scott to help elect @CalebFrostman this spring, and now she’s hard at work helping knock doors for Democrats up and down the ballot! https://t.co/jMGDZV55hJ
Apprenticeship programs are a win-win: students get paid to train on the job and businesses get well-trained, qualified workers. We need to grow these programs and pass the PARTNERS Act. https://t.co/YFkdWaiMgi
What a way to kick off Labor Day weekend! This morning, I met some of the men and women who are getting a great foundation for a career because of the apprenticeship program at the @IBEW Local 158 Training Center. Keep up the great work! https://t.co/MqquJqarSH
Actions speak a lot louder than words, @LeahVukmir.		And you've supported measures time and again that would take us back to the days when insurance companies wrote the rules, and Wisconsinites with pre-existing conditions could be denied coverage.		https://t.co/oMIXlpYxGe
These insurance plans don’t have to cover:	❌ Prescription drugs	❌ Emergency room visits	❌ Maternity care	❌ Folks with preexisting conditions like asthma or diabetes 		In other words, it’s not really health care. 		https://t.co/T5nC2eoq2G
The Trump administration gave up the game tonight — @mike_pence is openly saying that with @LeahVukmir in the Senate, they will try to repeal the Affordable Care Act yet again. 		That’s what’s at stake in this election. https://t.co/3ayFRLKx4R
I think we should take people at their word, and well… 		"We made an effort to fully repeal and replace Obamacare, and we'll continue with @LeahVukmir in the Senate. We'll continue to go back to that." — @Mike_Pence https://t.co/ELcaCseLO3
If you work hard and play by the rules, you should be able to get ahead. Right now, that’s not the case for American businesses. And it’s gotta change. 		https://t.co/Fb9GQ07zGL
Wisconsinites have been doing what we do best, coming together and working hard to start the recovery process. Now they need Washington to do its part. 		https://t.co/OkO9qYosH5

Heck yeah! https://t.co/A3cQIFdcnK
When it comes to pre-existing conditions, @LeahVukmir is standing with her corporate pals yet again — supporting junk plans that let her insurance company backers deny coverage to Wisconsinites who need it most. 		It’s clear where her priorities lie.

At the end of the day, if @LeahVukmir gets elected, she won’t be working for Wisconsin. She’ll be working for the corporate special interests spending millions to buy themselves a Senate seat. 7/ 		https://t.co/yn9TASJ6Dh
President Trump said he backed my Buy American water infrastructure plan “100%.” But @LeahVukmir opposes it. She says it's too expensive to invest in America. 6/ 		https://t.co/07qbH2Z7QR
If @LeahVukmir has her way, the tax code will keep supporting the wealthiest one percent and big corporations, while putting older Americans at risk of losing the benefits they’ve earned. 5/ 		https://t.co/lcbrSwdITh
Lives are being lost to the addiction crisis every day. I’m working to give communities the tools they need to combat it head-on. My opponent thinks we can fix this crisis with a wall 1,000 miles away. 4/ 		https://t.co/UPj7iQWek1
While I’m working to lower health care costs for hardworking Wisconsinites, @LeahVukmir wants to eliminate programs that make health care affordable. That’s just wrong. 3/ 		https://t.co/osOBjkMFBH
.@LeahVukmir supports a full repeal of the Affordable Care Act, which guarantees protections for folks with pre-existing conditions. The health care of one quarter of Wisconsinites and millions of Americans is at stake. 2/ 		https://t.co/TQ5KxQOTQ4
I have been fighting tooth and nail to do right by the folks I was elected to serve. Instead of helping Wisconsin families get ahead, @LeahVukmir wants to keep rewarding the wealthy and powerful. That’s what’s at stake in this election. 1/
Last night, Wisconsinites came together to nominate progressive champions in races across our state. I’m glad to be supporting @Tony4WI, @TheOtherMandela, and the entire Democratic ticket as we look ahead to November! https://t.co/uNK0k3Nx1l

Alright, #TeamTammy. Now that Tammy has an opponent, the special interests are going into overdrive to buy Wisconsin’s Senate seat. But luckily, our grassroots team is already hard at work to get Tammy reelected. Find out how you can join the team &gt;&gt; https://t.co/LTAfcoNy9A
I’m going to keep standing up to the powerful groups who want to keep the system rigged for themselves.		That’s why this campaign is fueled by grassroots dollars. Join our team today: https://t.co/CD1WnUQIJs
The Republican primary is over and I officially have an opponent, but let’s face it — I’m really running against the special interests who want a bought and paid for Senator. Because they know that’s not me.		Congratulations to @LeahVukmir. —TB
Today’s the Republican primary and I’ll officially have an opponent.		Billionaires like the Koch brothers network &amp; Dick Uihlein are trying to buy a Senator who will do their bidding, instead of fighting for Wisconsin. This is a promise: I will never stop fighting for you. 11/11
And I’m standing up for those Wisconsinites who work hard and play by the rules, but see a tax system that’s rewarding wealth over hard work. 10/ https://t.co/UCvhs0W4VW

I’m standing up for people like Tara. During the fight to protect health care, she wrote to me saying, “I wish every Senator could come sit at my table, look me in the eyes and tell me how much they think my kids are worth.” So I did. 2/ https://t.co/eF8PPZsJzk

Thanks for joining me today, everybody! Being a farmer is a lot of hard work, but it’s the best job in the world. — Bert #WIFarm https://t.co/sQfKUEa1Vr
My wife, Trish, just got home — she’s a nurse. I used to get nervous thinking about how we’d get health insurance if we stopped getting it through her work. I’m a lot less nervous knowing the Affordable Care Act is there for farmers who run their own businesses. #WIFarm https://t.co/EJao7xVOiW
It’s a lot quieter around the house now that my four kids are grown up. Luckily my daughter and her family live just about a mile and a half down the road. And we get to be the close grandparents! #WIFarm https://t.co/fexUTcl1kX
We produce a good amount of milk, but it’s gotten harder to find markets. That’s why programs like the MPP are so important. It helps those farmers who are doing everything right, but without help could be left out to dry. #WIFarm		https://t.co/5LbHjOw6Xr
Now it’s time to go get the cows and start milking again. Most days, it’s just me here on the farm and it’s great to have my dog to keep me company. He’s getting older, but he still loves coming out to the pasture. #WIFarm https://t.co/2fJczWr0Im
Farming can be really stressful at times — it’s your entire life! I know a lot of farmers feel overwhelmed by how big a job it all is. Farmers need to know they’re not alone. #WIFarm 		https://t.co/JdHIgsHsvS
Since we graze our cows, that frees up a lot of my time for other work. Innovations like grazing really changed how our farm works. It’s good to know that Tammy Baldwin is trying to give us the tools we need to stay successful. #WIFarm 		https://t.co/i6D0A4Eebi
Hear that? That’s one of my favorite sounds. https://t.co/rn4yZPlBXi
When the calves are older, they’ll get to go out and graze with the rest of the herd. Even in Wisconsin weather, our cows get to graze all the way up to December 1. It’s great for me as a farmer, and the cows love it. #WIFarm https://t.co/saEKPGlAHM
I’m always trying to do things better here on the farm. 25 years ago, I was bit by the grazing bug and have been grazing my cows ever since. That means cows get to spend all day outside. Every 12 hours, I move the fence so they get new, fresh grass to munch on. #WIFarm https://t.co/Q9MG12mVRr
The calves are weaned now and are starting to act like teenagers! We breed different types of cows, so no two look exactly the same. #WIFarm https://t.co/si5apQqWIn
My favorite thing is when my daughter Meagan joins me around the farm. I’m training her to take over the farm in a few years and she comes over a few times a week to help me milk.  #WIFarm https://t.co/uPRemtVvlj
I wake up around 5:00 most mornings to milk the cows. We’re small enough that I can milk them myself in an hour or two. #WIFarm https://t.co/oEewPCnqfb

But being on special interests’ bad side means I’m the top target of outside spending this election. They’ve spent nearly $10 MILLION to beat me already.
Big Oil and Big Pharma and Wall Street don’t like me very much, and I’m okay with that. My priority will always be getting the job done for hardworking families.
On @LateNightSeth talking about the heartbreaking stories coming from our southern border. The Trump administration is trying to use young kids as pawns. We’ve seen this before. It’s just despicable.

What did the GOP accomplish before the holidays?	❌ Permanent CHIP funding	❌ Solution on pensions	❌ Legislation for Dreamers	✅ Tax cuts for the ultra-rich and big corporations		We’re fed up with short-sighted solutions and out-of-whack priorities

House Republicans just showed their constituents who they really work for: the ultra-rich and large corporations. But we can still try to stop this bill. Call your Senators and tell them to #VoteNo on the #GOPTaxScam: https://t.co/foObKpdeue

Trumpcare betrays rural Wisconsin. Hospital and nursing home care will be cut, and if you are over 50 you pay more for less.

And AARP is right: insurance companies shouldn't charge 5 times as much for coverage if you are a senior.
That's why I authored the amendment to allow your child to stay on your policy until age 26. I will always fight for that.
If you are one of up to 129 million people with pre-existing conditions you shouldn't be charged more for health coverage.
If you are a young adult you should not have to choose between your career and a job with healthcare.
No child should have economic or health conditions leaving them uninsured. That's why I've always supported healthcare reform.
At a young age I fell ill with a serious illness, leaving only expensive insurance or none at all with my pre-existing condition.

I was a champion of that provision. I don't believe the people of Wisconsin sent me to Washington to take away healthcare.
They told me, "What we want is to get an education and make our own decisions without having to choose between that and health insurance."
One of the most common sense provisions of the ACA is to allow young people to stay on their parent's health insurance until they are 26.

The answer was clearly Tammy Baldwin, not Tommy Thompson. #WIsenDebate Join us at http://t.co/pb8omM3Y
Watching #WIsenDebate, voters are asking themselves 1 question - Which candidate will stand up for middle class?
In contrast, Thompson represented the politics of the past, offered the same name calling &amp; finger pointing that defines DC #WIsenDebate
Tammy represented the future &amp; spoke about her commitment to fighting for WI and moving our state &amp; country forward. #WIsenDebate
This #WIsenDebate presented WI w/ a clear contrast &amp; choice. Tammy has taken on powerful interests. Thompson has taken them on as clients.
"If that’s what you’re looking for in a Sen, I hope you’ll join my campaign &amp; help move us forward." - TB #WIsenDebate http://t.co/pb8omM3Y
"The differences between us are clear.  I’m running to be a voice for the people – not another voice for the powerful." TB #WIsenDebate
"My opponent said he wants to do away with Medicare and turn it into a voucher plan, forcing seniors to pay more" TB #WIsenDebate #Tammy2012
"I want a budget that ends the war in Afghanistan and gets rid of giveaways to powerful special interests," TB #WIsenDebate
“My opponent opposes the Buffett Rule. His plan would give millionaires new tax cuts, while actually raising taxes on the middle class”  TB
“I believe that having two sets of rules makes no kind of sense.  That’s why I support the Buffett Rule”  TB #WIsenDebate #Tammy2012
“You’ve heard from two very different candidates with two very different visions for Wisconsin’s future.” TB #WIsenDebate
Tommy signed a pledge to DC lobbyist Grover Norquist, where is his pledge to #WI's middle class? #WIsenDebate #Tammy2012
FACT CHECK: Thompson campaign's claim on Medicare is FALSE http://t.co/wC48DtUE #WIsenDebate #Tammy2012
Tommy takes on the special interests... as clients. He is "a private sector" http://t.co/V6e2Aqmu #thingstommysays #WIsenDebate #Tammy2012
In WI, we make things. Manufacturing is the backbone of our state -- and I've got agenda to get us going again. #WIsenDebate #Tammy2012
Tommy Thompson's plans for #Medicare? Do Away with It! http://t.co/qgyIKqVs #WIsenDebate #Tammy2012
Tommy Thompson's Tax plan: Tax Cuts for Millionaires like him, paid for with middle class tax increases http://t.co/jQwuBUqy #WIsenDebate
Tammy has a long history of working across the aisle on issues from health care to veterans benefits #WIsenDebate #Tammy2012
RT @D_Verner: Good to hear a PLAN to reduce debt instead of just rambling about it. @TammyBaldwinWI has some good ideas.
RT @mattjmcnally: The Tommy Thompson Sweet heart deal for Pharmaceutical comanies costs $156 billion  #wisen
RT @mforbeck: Catching the WI senatorial debate: http://t.co/TxwmCEIr Go, @TammyBaldwinWI!
RT @David_Shorr: Good for @TammyBaldwinWI for distinguishing between deficit reduction and re-growing the economy #WISenDebate
RT @steph4Barack: @TammyBaldwinWI Tammy is on fire!
“So tonight, as we answer questions, ask yourself this question: Who do you believe will stand up for the middle class?” - TB #WIsenDebate
“I’ve taken on powerful interests on behalf of ordinary people.  My opponent has taken on powerful interests – as clients.” TB #WIsenDebate
“My opponent spent his time in DC helping those same special interests drown out your voice &amp; rig the system against you.” TB #WIsenDebate
“I’ve spent my time fighting to make the voice of the middle class heard, standing up to Wall St &amp; the big insurance co’s.” TB #WIsenDebate
“That’s why it often feels like Washington isn’t listening to the middle class… WI needs a Senator who will. ” TB #WIsenDebate
“powerful special interests, the ones who can spend the most money &amp; get the best lobbyists – get to write their own rules” TB #WIsenDebate
