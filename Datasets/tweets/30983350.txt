@RoundRockISD and @sfloresRRISD so afraid of admitting and be required to address institutional racism that they‚Äôre manipulating data. Not a good look for so-called educators. #BlackLivesMatterAtSchool #RRISD1family
Disparate discipline is comparing against white students not the percentage of students disciplined within each demographic, @RoundRockISD. Research dept=propaganda creators #SixFigurePhDsSpreadingMisinformation #SchoolSafetyTaskForce #RRISD1family
So now @RoundRockISD Administration is trying to claim victory over disparate discipline! #PlayingWithNumbers #WeCallBullshit #RRISD1family Eight years on TEA Watch List, no progress. #BlackLivesMatterAtSchool

@vessacory @RoundRockISD @sfloresRRISD Aside from my providing specifics, I hope you‚Äôre scrutinizing the M&amp;O budget with a critical eye, too. Flores &amp; Company will insist that it‚Äôs all crucial, but that‚Äôs simply hogwash.

@YungTiffanie 5/5 Say it with me, @sfloresRRISD: Black lives matter. Lifting up those who already enjoy privilege doesn‚Äôt address @RoundRockISD's institutional racism. Lift up the most oppressed and your ‚Äúequity for all‚Äù goal will automatically be met.
@YungTiffanie 4/5 In Districtwide Subcommittee of @RoundRockISD CBC, central district administrators' racial bias was on display. Disgusting stereotypes used to justify district ‚Äúneeds.‚Äù ISD PD meeting 11/13 saw concerns of African Americans &amp; allies gaslighted, dismissed and marginalized.
@YungTiffanie 3/5 If you want credibility on this issue, @sfloresRRISD, you‚Äôll stop talking/defending/marketing and start listening. Were you not paying attention to public comments at last board meeting? Sign up for (and participate in) Joyce‚Äôs training. Put action to words.
@YungTiffanie 2/5 Getting serious about changing @RoundRockISD's documented institutional racism and horrific record on disparate discipline requires that Superintendent @sfloresRRISD accept that his life experience is radically different from that of African Americans.
@YungTiffanie 1/5 @RoundRockISD &amp; its apologists have spent past six months trying to marginalize, dismiss, and silence bold and courageous parents, students and teachers who have called for an end to RRISD‚Äôs documented institutional racism. Even tried to isolate them from white allies.

@Mikeleewhite @Spoofjay @JLJohnsonElem @RoundRockISD @VoteYesRRISD @sfloresRRISD There you go again, acting like a de-facto authority on @RoundRockISD  and its bloated bond when you‚Äôre actually shilling. There is no middle ground on an all-or-nothing bond that holds kids hostage.
@Mikeleewhite @Spoofjay @JLJohnsonElem @RoundRockISD @VoteYesRRISD @sfloresRRISD I‚Äôm not twisting your arm @Mikeleewhite to force you to keep making false/disingenuous claims about @RoundRockISD and its bloated bond. You‚Äôre free to stop spreading disinformation at any time.
@Mikeleewhite @Spoofjay @JLJohnsonElem @RoundRockISD @VoteYesRRISD @sfloresRRISD ‚ÄúPersonal vendettas?‚Äù That‚Äôs the most hilarious thing you‚Äôve written today, @Mikeleewhite. You keep implying I have no skin in the game. ü§£ü§£ü§£ I‚Äôve seen no indication that you‚Äôre interested in learning facts but rather are more consumed with spreading @RoundRockISD fantasies.
@Mikeleewhite @Spoofjay @JLJohnsonElem @RoundRockISD @VoteYesRRISD I‚Äôll take 1,000 of those signs. They‚Äôll make good kindling for my next BBQ. üòÄ
@Mikeleewhite @Spoofjay @JLJohnsonElem @RoundRockISD @VoteYesRRISD Why are you so preoccupied with procreation? Do you actually believe that only people with students attending @RoundRockISD schools care about children and education? I think the current RoundRockISD PTA Council President might be offended by that suggestion.
@Mikeleewhite @Spoofjay @JLJohnsonElem @RoundRockISD @VoteYesRRISD Characterizing the @RoundRockISD 2018 bond proposal as all about kids‚Äô safety and security is deceitful. Another hand wringing ploy to pass a bloated bond. The district and its sycophants will say anything to grab half a billion dollars.
@Mikeleewhite @Spoofjay @JLJohnsonElem @RoundRockISD @VoteYesRRISD Or, are you repeating @sfloresRRISD arrogantly ignorant and on-record quote that taxpayers who don‚Äôt have kids in @RoundRockISD schools ‚Äúdon‚Äôt have any skin in the game?‚Äù Puleeze.
@Mikeleewhite @Spoofjay @JLJohnsonElem @RoundRockISD @VoteYesRRISD If you‚Äôd done your homework, you‚Äôd know 60% of adults living in the @RoundRockISD footprint and eligible to vote don‚Äôt have children in district schools. Are you saying #GiveUsYourMoney but don‚Äôt hold the district accountable?
@Mikeleewhite @Spoofjay @JLJohnsonElem @RoundRockISD @VoteYesRRISD And how many board meetings have you attended in the past year and a half? How many district committees have you served on? How many @RoundRockISD schools have you toured that your children don‚Äôt attend? How much money have you donated to clear out unpaid school lunch bills?
@Mikeleewhite @Spoofjay @JLJohnsonElem @RoundRockISD @VoteYesRRISD Nope, wrong again. All kids safety and security are NOT addressed by this bond. Not by a long shot. https://t.co/PtGSXvANUv
@Mikeleewhite @Spoofjay @JLJohnsonElem @RoundRockISD Now, there‚Äôs some seriously funny math. ü§£
@Mikeleewhite @Spoofjay @JLJohnsonElem @RoundRockISD Funny math like that used by @RoundRockISD and your business backed PAC to deceive voters, you mean. #NiceTry You and your ilk hide behind the children (‚Äúbut it‚Äôs for the children!‚Äù) to fleece hard working taxpayers for your own benefit. #KidsNotCommerce
@Mikeleewhite @Spoofjay @JLJohnsonElem @RoundRockISD @VoteYesRRISD Obviously, you live in an echo chamber. Or, only hang out with RR City and @RoundRockISD sycophants and political sheep. You really ought to consider expanding your circle and talk to other community members and leaders and district volunteers. #NoTransparencyNoTrust
@Mikeleewhite @Spoofjay @JLJohnsonElem @RoundRockISD @VoteYesRRISD Plenty of facts including those I cite show voters why they should vote NO on @RoundRockISD bond. District has horrific record on disparate discipline of SPED &amp; black &amp; brown students and institutional racism. Cited by TEA for multiple years. What about their safety &amp; security? https://t.co/OCSJzaYQpw
@Mikeleewhite @Spoofjay @JLJohnsonElem @RoundRockISD @VoteYesRRISD You and your kids benefit when your company wins contracts. #KidsNotCommerce This is failed 2017 bond on steroids. @RoundRockISD hides behind photos of kids and committees for its #MoneyGrab. #PropagandaCentral
@Mikeleewhite @Spoofjay @JLJohnsonElem @RoundRockISD Not from a district that has already been cited for bond project mismanagement. Point is, @RoundRockISD ‚Äúvetted‚Äù bond projects‚Äô costs, not Citizens Bond Committee.
@Mikeleewhite @Spoofjay @JLJohnsonElem So yeah, @Mikeleewhite who‚Äôs w/pro-bond PAC, many of us have investigated @RoundRockISD &amp; projects &amp; bloated bonds thoroughly &amp; who selflessly served on the CBC, too. Berating &amp; bullying voters isn‚Äôt a winning strategy. #NotSheep #NotGoingAway #NotThisBond #KidsNotCommerce
@Mikeleewhite @Spoofjay @JLJohnsonElem Bond surplus funds are used to buy/build items &amp; projects @RoundRockISD knows/fears voters won‚Äôt approve (Success HS, new RRHS, industrial bldgs and land to prevent charters from expanding, etc.) &amp; to cover up project mismanagement (McNeil HS). #rrisd #MoneyGrab
@Mikeleewhite @Spoofjay @JLJohnsonElem High costs of virtually every item in @RoundRockISD bond is designed to build a fund surplus as in past bond measures. Example: voters bought the ~$37M estimate in 2014 to build &amp; furnish  @JLJohnsonElem but actual cost more like $24M.
@Mikeleewhite @Spoofjay @JLJohnsonElem Opposition to @RoundRockISD bond consists primarily of 2017 and 2018 Citizens Bond Committee members who participated in attempt to build a good bond but instead saw a district-led effort hell bent on bringing forth another bloated bond proposal that benefits few at cost of many.
@Mikeleewhite @Spoofjay @JLJohnsonElem Actual critical needs of @RoundRockISD total no more than $200M according to district budget presentations. Remaining funds in bond 2018 is a #MoneyGrab bundled into a single bond that holds true needs hostage to commercial interests and district empire building aims.
@Mikeleewhite @Spoofjay @JLJohnsonElem Those insiders want @RoundRockISD bond money to fuel pet projects that sank the 2017 bond‚Äîa Natatorium to serve .0005% of the District‚Äôs 50k student population, destruction of C.D. Fulkes Middle School to serve as a City performing arts venue, enough leftover cash for HS 6.
@Mikeleewhite @Spoofjay @JLJohnsonElem The most ardent proponents of @RoundRockISD 2018 bond, aside from District employees, are Round Rock City and Chamber insiders and special interest organizations who stand to potentially benefit financially from more than a half billion dollars of taxpayer funds.
@Mikeleewhite @Spoofjay @JLJohnsonElem Bond pricing was never vetted by bond committee members. Figures came from @RoundRockISD which multiplied the already inflated 2017 bond figures by as much as 30%. The district‚Äôs goal from the start was to get to a bond of ~$500M. #MoneyGrab
@Mikeleewhite @Spoofjay @JLJohnsonElem Just 104 people were on the @RoundRockISD 2018 Citizens Bond Committee not 300, according to District records obtained via open records process.

And now they‚Äôre distorting the word ‚Äúfamily.‚Äù Yesterday, @RoundRockISD gathered up teachers and staff, most of whom were required to go to their home schools to be transported to Cedar Park by a reported fleet of 150+ school buses. This was an employee rally. #WordsMatter https://t.co/AsFSXfa378
The mission of a school district is to educate children. It‚Äôs not to provide a platform for promoting district executives and advancing their careers.
Every parent, teacher &amp; resident in the @RoundRockISD footprint has to wonder why this governmental agency and its top brass spend massive time and money on constant self promotion while also begging and pleading for more tax dollars for ‚Äúcrumbling‚Äù facilities. https://t.co/SJzk4NGxaj

Good to remember this as parents begin sending kids back to school. Teachers in @RoundRockISD (TX) received a puny raise this budget cycle but can‚Äôt get ahead. District figures in inflation for bond ask, but ignores the people who actually deliver education. https://t.co/PSm1hRyo0o

@Spoofjay Or, are they just asking every @RoundRockISD taxpayer for hundreds of millions of dollars for one big slush fund to do with as they please? #NoTtansparencyNoBond
@Spoofjay Or, maybe it‚Äôs the acreage purchased by the District and rezoned by the City of Round Rock for the original HS 6 which was to be located on A W Grimes where it might actually be needed?
@Spoofjay Or the $8.5 million that voters approved in 2014 for CD Fulkes that was never spent in CD Fulkes?
