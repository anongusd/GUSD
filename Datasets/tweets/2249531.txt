During Flynn‘s tenure as National Security Adviser, some friends of @DonaldJTrumpJr reportedly showed up with a weird blueprint for Venezuela.		The entire pitch appeared to be “a pretext for this great business opportunity for them,” one person familiar with the incident said. https://t.co/f0SfZx5MTa
This ⁦@POLITICOMag⁩ piece on the early days of the NSC under @realDonaldTrump is an incredible read. It also touches on an issue I’ve been asking about since very early on, the administration’s weird fixation with Nicolas Maduro and Venezuela: https://t.co/3VSp9i7pUQ
@svdate It’s such an old celebration it was recognized back when Frederick Douglass was doing his thing.
He’s talking about how no one is leaving, but folks *can’t* leave because the @SecretService will freeze all movement until @realDonaldTrump has left.
Oh for fucks sake he’s touting “getting our beautiful, beautiful Otto [Warmbier]” back (in a coma) as a reason his approach to North Korea is good.
Another ridiculous lie is the idea that the visa lottery doesn’t involve vetting.
More weirdness is the way @realDonaldTrump keeps repeating the ridiculous lie that other countries somehow pick people to enter visa lotteries.
More facts on immigration courts from an immigration judge		https://t.co/iundNpYT7z
Now he’s lying about the number of asylum seekers who show up for immigration court.
Also very weird is this idea @realDonaldTrump has that previous national emergency declarations were made to protect people in foreign countries, rather than protecting Americans from the impact of instability in those countries.
At least he knows the difference between “precedent” and “president” now
The way @realDonaldTrump describes immigrants as being “sent” from their home countries in some kind of conspiracy by those countries is downright weird.
RT @nathanTbernard: Far right lunatic Laura Loomer “loomers” herself, gets banned from CPAC for shrieking at reporters, video confirms http…
Just popping back to note that the country’s motto is “E pluribus unum.”
So @realDonaldTrump is talking about someone who was “violently punched in the face.”		Is there such thing as a non-violent punch to the face?
As I’m really trying to stay off Twitter, if you’ve just checked in to this thread please follow this @ddale8 thread, he does this better than anyone (me included).		https://t.co/9CN947g9C9
#CPAC attendees now laughing at the idea of disaster aid for wildfire victims.
Oh my god he’s talking about raking  forests again.
Answer: they got elected to Congress in their country, which is the United States. https://t.co/pHtohuzmAw
Now he’s attacking the fed, another agency run by people who know what they’re talking about. 		I detect a pattern.
“Where do they come from?” he asks about people who disagree with his tariff policies.		Answer: places where proof matters, like universities
His prediction that “mirrored” tariffs will result in zero tariffs on either side is just magical thinking.
Back to trade, he still doesn’t get that a trade deficit does not cause us to lose money.
Now he’s talking about people in Congress “who hate our country.”		“How did they do in their country? Not so good,” he says of members of Congress who are, of course, US citizens.
Back to trade, he is conflating a foreign car company making a business decision to a foreign country’s trade policies. 		The way he talks about Germany’s auto industry as if it’s been nationalized, you’d think he doesn’t understand the difference between capitalism and socialism
“Maybe that’s a good thing,” he concedes.
He appears bewildered by the fact that Americans respect — and even revere — the institution of the presidency and call him “Mr. President.”
Oh, now we’re going back on topic? 		Wait no he’s talking about “reviews” of his speeches and is appearing to be suggesting to @MarkMeadows that the reason media doesn’t unquestioningly repeat his lies and tout his alleged accomplishments should be investigated.
My video stream cut out, I tuned back a minut later and he’s still talking about his crowd sizes.
Speaking of @daveweigel POTUS muses about whether he’d have been fired for being a conservative.		Who’s going to tell him Dave got his start at @reason (a libertarian publication)
He’s talking about having record crowds at every event. 		I guess he forgot about Inauguration Day when he sent @seanspicer out to lie about his crowd size.
And @daveweigel gets a presidential shout-out and ridicule over...not having a private jet? 🤔
He just said something true: it is easy to talk to a crowd when that crowd is always full of supporters who will unquestioningly believe every single lie.
Every year @realDonaldTrump lies about the size of his CPAC crowd. You’d think it’d be one of the crowds he would reliably have no reason to lie about.
shallowest level of partisan self-interest.
The fact that @realDonaldTrump still does not understand why the same Democrats who were apoplectic over how @Comey handled the HRC email thing would still object to his firing over what POTUS called “this Russia thing with Trump and Russia” shows he can’t think beyond the...
Goddamnit I guess I’m doing this. 		Attorneys General are not “weak and ineffective” because they follow ethics rules.
Mueller is actually not best friends with @comey		You know who is close with Mueller though? Bill Barr.
Goes without saying that a dispute over golf club fees is not an actual conflict of interest
He’s complaining that no one voted for Robert Mueller or Rod Rosenstein.		People voted for @realDonaldTrump who appointed Rod Rosenstein.
Now, the guy who built his political rise on fake investigating Barack Obama’s  background is railing against the idea that being president should subject his own background to scrutiny.
He just said it’s “not really” a tax, so he’s either lying or is just so incredibly dense that he can’t grasp that he could be wrong.
I’m really trying to stay off Twitter but I want to point out once again that based on his #CPAC speech @realDonaldTrump appears to still have no goddamn clue that tariffs are taxes paid by Americans and aren’t paid by China.

@jbouie @districtdiatric @ejdrouillard This idea that political physics might not allow a candidate who is nonwhite/female/both to be positively received by voters who aren’t coastal/city-dwellers/nonwhite/whatever is a fake problem.

@carondg @realDonaldTrump Nothing to do with @realDonaldTrump it’s just a pet peeve of mine
These things have always been awkward and hard to pull off but she seems to be striking the right tone
Either way she’s not falling flat or embarrassing herself, which, given the history of these responses, is a victory in and of itself.
There’s a lot of “me” in her speech, though.
.@staceyabrams knows it’s “Attorneys General” not “Attorney Generals” — points for grammar right there.
RT @murphymike: A thousand talented Democratic filmmakers in Hollywood and NYC and yet the Dems still never ask for help on these things...
DEM RESPONSE UPDATE: Stacy Abrams has not reached for a bottle of water.
CAPITOL HISTORY FACT CHECK: the vote to end slavery did not take place in the current House chamber
IRONY NOTE: President who celebrates “America First” speaking reverently of the allied invasion of Europe.
Credit where credit is due, having the survivor and a soldier who liberated him there is a damn cool moment.
TIMELINE NOTE: He’s wrapping himself up with holocaust survivors less than two years after he called neo-Nazis “fine people”
”We must never ignore the vile poison of anti-Semitism, or those who spread its venomous creed.  With one voice, we must confront this hatred anywhere and everywhere it occurs.” — his administration ended a DHS program to combat anti-semetism and right wing terror.
“We will not avert our eyes from a regime that chants death to America and threatens genocide against the Jewish people.”		You know who else threatens genocide against the Jewish people? Many of the white nationalists who support him.
Fact Check: the “disastrous” part of the Iran deal was:		A. It was negotiated under @BarackObama 	B. Netanyahu didn’t like it.
“To ensure this corrupt dictatorship never acquires nuclear weapons, I withdrew the United States from the disastrous Iran nuclear deal.  And last fall, we put in place the toughest sanctions ever imposed on a country.” — he’s telling his military &amp; intel people to fuck off again
He’s basically lying to the face of the Joint Chiefs and telling them to go fuck themselves here.
“ As a candidate for President, I pledged a new approach.  Great nations do not fight endless wars.” — this section is Russia-approved
“Tonight, we renew our resolve that America will never be a socialist country.”		To @realDonaldTrump a “socialist” country is a stand in for “a country with Democrats in power”		https://t.co/jcpV6HnRQQ
Once again I’ll note that Maduro is the ONLY authoritarian leader @realDonaldTrump has a problem with and his administration has never adequately explained why.
“Much work remains to be done, but my relationship with Kim Jong Un is a good one.  And Chairman Kim and I will meet again on February 27 and 28 in Vietnam.” — more authoritarian ass-kissing.
“If I had not been elected President of the United States, we would right now, in my opinion, be in a major war with North Korea with potentially millions of people killed.” — No serious person believes this.
“Our hostages have come home, nuclear testing has stopped, and there has not been a missile launch in 15 months.” 		DPRK doesn’t need to do nuclear testing because they perfected their design. The hostages he keeps talking about WERE USED TO JUSTIFY LAST YEAR’S SUMMIT ALSO!
“We are also getting other nations to pay their fair share.  For years, the United States was being treated very unfairly by NATO -- but now we have secured a $100 billion increase in defense spending from NATO allies.”		NATO IS NOT A COUNTRY CLUB
“Pain-capable” antiabortion bills would amount to a total abortion ban under many circumstances
“Lawmakers in New York cheered with delight upon the passage of legislation that would allow a baby to be ripped from the mother's womb moments before birth.” — New York resident @realDonaldTrump had a lawyer whose job it was to dole out hush money and procure abortions
“I am also proud to be the first President to include in my budget a plan for nationwide paid family leave -- so that every new parent has the chance to bond with their newborn child.” — the paid leave proposal promoted by unqualified @IvankaTrump is paid from social security
“To help support working parents, the time has come to pass school choice for America's children.” — @BetsyDeVosED wants to replace public schools with homeschooling and religious schools / promote Christian dominionist approved curricula with federal funds.
“My budget will ask Democrats and Republicans to make the needed commitment to eliminate the HIV epidemic in the United States within 10 years.  Together, we will defeat AIDS in America.”		His budget requires abstinence-only sex education.
The reason other countries pay less is they have single payer systems that can negotiate better deals. 		Medicare is forbidden from negotiating prices.
“I know that the Congress is eager to pass an infrastructure bill,” @realDonaldTrump says (just as long as it doesn’t benefit @SenSchumer voters like the Gateway Tunnel project he opposes)
That bill would give the president the authority to unilaterally raise taxes on Americans. Very Republican.
“Tonight, I am also asking you to pass the United States Reciprocal Trade Act so that if another country places an unfair tariff on an American product, we can charge them the exact same tariff on the same product that they sell to us.”		TARIFFS ARE TAXES. THIS BILL RAISES TAXES!
USMCA is almost identical to NAFTA.
Repeat after me:		👏🏻TARIFFS👏🏻ARE👏🏻TAXES👏🏻		👏🏻THEY👏🏻ARE👏🏻PAID👏🏻BY👏🏻 	👏🏻AMERICAN👏🏻COMPANIES👏🏻 	👏🏻 THEY👏🏻RAISE👏🏻PRICES👏🏻 	👏🏻FOR👏🏻AMERICAN👏🏻 	👏🏻CONSUMERS👏🏻		👏🏻THEY👏🏻ARE👏🏻NOT👏🏻PAID👏🏻 👏🏻 BY👏🏻CHINA👏🏻
“As part of our commitment to improving opportunity for women everywhere, this Thursday we are launching the first ever Government-wide initiative focused on economic empowerment for women in developing countries.” —-another pet project @IvankaTrump is unqualified to lead
“Exactly one century after the Congress passed the Constitutional amendment giving women the right to vote, we also have more women serving in the Congress than ever before.” 		Most would probably vote to impeach him.
He just keeps giving the newly elected House women their moment doesn’t he?
It’s true @realDonaldTrump has created jobs for women. Look at the Democratic side of the House.
“Let’s compromise and reach a deal” by giving me every single thing I want — @realDonaldTrump
Is it me or is “powerful” a bizarre word to describe a stationary object like a barrier?
Not true that “most of the people in this room” voted for a wall, but who am I kidding most of this speech is lies.
“In the last 2 years, our brave ICE officers made 266,000 arrests of criminal aliens, including those charged or convicted of nearly 100,000 assaults, 30,000 sex crimes, and 4,000 killings.” — this number includes LEGAL IMMIGRANTS.
https://t.co/vv9PC2KjNd
“Angel Mom” is a designation made up by a literal hate group.
“The savage gang, MS-13, now operates in 20 different American States, and they almost all come through our southern border.” — also a lie. Many are born here. Also, it’s 10,000 people across 50 states.
Where is Congressman Joe Wilson to shout “YOU LIE!” when you need him?
“As we speak, large, organized caravans are on the march to the United States.” — MORE LIES
“Friends” means @KimKardashian
“If there is going to be peace and legislation, there cannot be war and investigation.  It just doesn't work that way!” @realDonaldTrump says, threatening to hold government hostage if anyone tries to hold him accountable for anything.
Once again @realDonaldTrump says “since the election” to give himself credit for the last few months of the @BarackObama administration
This line about “vision or vengeance” screams “PLEASE GO EASY ON ME”
Note: all those WWII veterans were either volunteers or drafted. @realDonaldTrump loves to surround himself with those who served.
Ugh, by saying “or a Democrat agenda” instead of “Democratic agenda” he’s already lapsed into partisan tropes.
It’s not taking @realDonaldTrump that long to get to the rostrum. Seems very few people want to shake his hand. Normally it takes a President more than a few minutes.
@ericgeller SO BIG
@NoahCRothman I keep asking about that. White House keeps telling me about last year’s hostage release. Lather, rinse, repeat.

We will not avert our eyes from a regime that chants Death to America and threatens genocide against the Jewish People
together we can stop it.	…	We stand with the Venezuelan people in their noble quest for freedom…		As a candidate for President, I pledged a new approach.  Great nations do not fight endless wars.	…
Both parties should be able to unite for a great rebuilding of America’s crumbling infrastructure.		It is unacceptable that Americans pay vastly more than people in other countries for the exact same drugs, often made in the exact same place.  This is wrong, unfair, and...
All Americans can be proud that we have more women in the workforce than ever before...	…	To build on our incredible economic success, one priority is paramount: reversing decades of calamitous trade policies.
No issue better illustrates the divide between America’s WORKING CLASS and America’s POLITICAL CLASS than illegal immigration.  Wealthy politicians and donors push for open borders while living their lives behind walls and gates and guards.
We have a moral duty to create an immigration system that protects the lives and jobs of our citizens.
... Alice’s story underscores the disparities and unfairness that can exist in criminal sentencing – and the need to remedy this injustice.
Last year, I heard through friends the story of Alice Johnson. I was deeply moved. In 1997, Alice was sentenced to life in prison as a first-time non-violent drug offender. Over the next two decades, she became a prison minister, inspiring others to choose a better path…
After 24 months of rapid progress, our economy is the envy of the world, our military is the most powerful on earth, and America is winning each and every day.
We have unleashed a revolution in American Energy – the United States is now the number one producer of oil and natural gas in the world.
Over the last two years, my administration has moved with urgency and historic speed to confront problems neglected by leaders of BOTH parties over many decades.
standard of living for the 21st century. 		Together, we can break decades of political stalemate. We can bridge old divisions, heal old wounds, build new coalitions, forge new solutions, and unlock the extraordinary promise of America’s future.  The decision is ours to make.
In the 20th century, America saved freedom, transformed science, and redefined the middle class standard of living for the entire world to see.  Now, we must step boldly and bravely into the next chapter of this Great American Adventure, and we must create a new...
The agenda I will lay out this evening is not a Republican Agenda or a Democrat Agenda.  It is the agenda of the American People.

@MollyJongFast Gotta be Senate-confirmed
If I'm able to take notes I do it, but sometimes I'll just write down a few words + timestamps or hit the "mark" button on my recorder and just concentrate on asking the damn questions. Bottom line, notes are great but if you're human you can screw up or get distracted.
First thing I tell the interns we get every year is to buy a recorder. If I'm doing a sit-down interview I'll sometimes bring a backup recorder. For phone calls I use an adapter and I frequently conference in a recording service as a backup.
Seems former @nytimes boss @JillAbramson has some wacky ideas about recording interviews, in other words, she doesn't. 		I'd like to think I have a very good memory. In fact, I do.

Carville suggests a pragmatic governor like @GovernorBullock is the way Dems get to 270, but admits an "emerging majority" remains alluring to some. “There’s a certain segment of the Democratic party that would rather lose with that coalition than win with a broad-based appeal.”
“The trauma that 2016 inflicted on the Democratic party cannot be overestimated," Carville said. “To the extent we know what Iowa caucus-goers are thinking, they’re very much in a mood that we need a seasoned candidate who can win the election.”
.@JamesCarville adds: “I doubt any…Democratic senator is going to come up with a brilliant policy initiative that is going to be signed into law between now and the election.” 		Post-2016 Iowa caucus-goers want experience AND someone with appeal outside coasts/cities, he saiys
.@BillClinton '92 messaging guru @JamesCarville predicts it'll be hard for senators to distinguish themselves w/o executive experience: “How are you in the minority in the Senate going to prove to people you can govern? The truth of that is you probably can’t in the time left.”
“Do not underestimate how people despise anyone who’s gone to Washington and become part of the problem. It’s hard to get that off of you [to longer] have that whiff over the campaign if you don’t have accomplishments,” @JoeTrippi says.
“People respond to people who can actually run governments and know how to turn the light switches on,” @JoeTrippi says, “Particularly if the current office holder couldn’t find the chair in the Oval Office.”		He adds that fiery exchanges w/ Trump nominees aren't all that:
But @GovHowardDean '04 campaign manager @JoeTrippi says legislators aren't necessarily the new hotness:  “The reason Senators don’t do well is the American people don’t have a very high regard for Washington, D.C., and they certainly don’t have one now."
.@MichaelTurk says the problem isn't just television: “The two political parties have tried to nationalize most issues," he says, precluding governors from distinguishing themselves with state-based policy initiatives.
“I think governors are at a greater disadvantage than they used to be,” says @mmckinnon  “It used to be that all politics was local, now all politics are national...the entire focus of the media universe is in Washington right now."
@AllanLichtman @JoeTrippi @MichaelTurk @mmckinnon @JamesCarville .@allanlichtman (@AmericanU prof who predicted Trump's 2016 win) says governors seem to have trouble getting attention so far “We’re in an era of politics where your ability to get on television, get a national profile and excite the base of your party has become most important."

@tedlieu Don’t say that too loud around @sethmoulton
These traumatized Sanders Democrats see his stubborn insistence on remaining an independent as having giving his (often cult-y) supporters tacit permission to not show up or to cast the protest votes for him, Jill Stein, etc that would’ve had ensured a Dem win had they voted HRC.
Many of the things Sanders primary voters said they admired about him before 11/9/16 (being an Independent, not part of the establishment/status quo, etc) are now seen by those same voters as dangerous liabilities, especially when Sanders’ ideas are increasingly ascendant.
As one consultant whose resume includes running a successful presidential campaign told me recently, DO NOT underestimate the effect the imprint that HRC’s close electoral college loss to Trump left on Democratic voters.
For every one of Sanders’ 2016 primary voters who’s told me they’re waiting for him to announce a 2020 run, there are 2 or 3 who have since been turned off by the way he’s encouraged his own Trump-like personality cult, right down to the hit pieces and Twitter trolls.
The fact that Sanders caucuses with Democrats isn’t relevant to a presidential primary. I’ve talked to a great many people who liked him for 2016 because there wasn’t a credible alternative to HRC but won’t be as fast to give him the benefit of the doubt this time. https://t.co/xUM2AqC1FD

The unpacking of his and his campaign’s actions during the 2016 election that we’ve gotten from Mueller/SDNY could support at least a whole semester’s worth of an elective course in election law.
That “one sided” coverage consisted largely of accurately reporting things he said and did, often with cameras rolling. 		Oh, and legally speaking, if a “very senior Trump campaign official” asked Stone to do anything, even for free, he was working on behalf of the campaign. https://t.co/adWiSY2rWO
Also, the dossier itself didn’t get released publicly until long after the election. 		So while @ashleyfeinberg (no relation) has not yet found a pee-pee tape, the main point of the whole thing (Russia made a concerted effort to support the Trump campaign) has largely been upheld

Now 66 years old, the veteran lobbyist, political operative and pro-Trump media personality’s life has come full circle as he once again finds himself at the center of a White House scandal that has gripped the nation for the past two years.
He was 19 years old — a mere boy among the president’s men — when allegations of obstruction of justice and abuse of power brought down the man he’d later call his mentor, whose face is still tattooed on his back.
Stone’s career in politics began during Nixon’s 1972 campaign, after which he first gained a measure of notoriety as the youngest person interviewed by Watergate investigators.

Kudlow then launched into a soliloquy filled with praise for federal workers, adding “Whatever semantic game you think you’re going to play with me, give them credit,” as if I was somehow discounting recalled workers’ efforts by pointing out that they’re not there by choice.
Me: “That’s not volunteering if you’re forced to work without pay and if you don’t show up you lose your job. That’s not what volunteering means.”		Kudlow: “You know what? I’m not even gonna go there. You know what I’m saying, it’s very clear.”

Why do I feel like I should’ve started my career as a Baltimore Sun police reporter?
In 1986, then-House Speaker Thomas P. O’Neill, Jr. denied then-President Ronald Reagan permission to speak to the House before a vote on whether to approve an aid package for Nicaraguan rebels, calling the proposed speech a “cheap political trick” meant to embarrass him.
Despite Trump’s claim that Pelosi was setting a “horrible precedent,” she is not the first speaker of the House to deny permission to address the House over concerns that he might use the opportunity to attack or embarrass him or her.
@ByronYork No one is barring anyone, Byron. He can’t just demand to speak in the House chamber. He needs permission and he can’t order the Speaker of the House to grant that permission. Or are you citing Charles I as an authority?

JUST NOW: @KellyannePolls won't acknowledge that @realDonaldTrump -- or any president -- needs permission to enter either the House or Senate chamber. 		Not only did this argument not end well for Charles I, it touched off the English Civil War.
@blakehounshell Yup. Can never get a straight answer on why Maduro is worse than all the other dictators the president seems to respect. Have asked many times.
Attention colleagues writing about @realDonaldTrump and the State of the Union:		Both chambers need to pass a CONCURRENT RESOLUTION to hold a joint session. It does not require any signature by the president.		A JOINT RESOLUTION is one that needs the president's signature.
@EliStokols He's going to be sad when he shows up and is kept out of the empty chamber.

In case you missed it, here's what a senior immigration judge said about the president's attacks on due process for asylum seekers.		https://t.co/iundNpYT7z
They also refuse to allow a path to citizenship because they assume new citizens will be Democrats.		His idea to allow asylum claims in “home countries” is nonsensical because the entire point of asylum is it’s what you want when you can’t stay to begin with.
What @realDonaldTrump is offering on DACA/TPS is not a deal in any sense of the word. It’s a temporary extension because talk radio won’t let him offer a real deal, they’d attack it as “amnesty.”
Let’s be clear: @realDonaldTrump is once again conflating “illegal immigration” and the asylum process. Asylum; by definition, is a LEGAL process and people waiting for their hearings are not in the US illegally.
At least admitted his goal is to end the asylum system.
His talk of “rank and file” Democrats and “radical left” is another attempt to drive a wedge between @SpeakerPelosi and her caucus. So far it hasn’t worked.
He’s now talking about “building trust” despite having backed out of several previous deals (DACA, wall, etc)
This speech is so far indistinguishable from his recent Oval Office address. 		“These are not talking points,” @realDonaldTrump says after repeating a bunch of talking points.

SHS defended North Korea’s alleged good-faith efforts by citing its release of several American hostages.		Those hostages were released BEFORE THE SINGAPORE SUMMIT.
I asked @PressSec why anything from the mouth of a North Korean official should be believed considering previously-promised denuclearization hasn’t happened. 		She gave a prepared non-answer then ignored follow-up on whether @realDonaldTrump lied when he said nuke threat.

@ThePendantLady @realDonaldTrump @SpeakerPelosi You're clearly not comprehending the issue here. The Speaker of the House (2nd in line for the presidency) can no more fly private or commercial than the Vice President can just ditch Air Force Two. It's a post-9/11 security protocol.
@daveweigel Not according to birthers
@realDonaldTrump @SpeakerPelosi "...And so what is going on is that the Department of Defense is going through its rules and regulations and having conversations with the Speaker about it. So Speaker Hastert had access to military aircraft and Speaker Pelosi will, too."
@realDonaldTrump @SpeakerPelosi But don't take my word for it. Here's Tony Snow, then George W.

@AriFleischer But don’t take my word for it, here’s what a past president of the Nat’l immigration judges assn, told me last year:		“It’s very troubling when we hear those accusations because there are no reputable statistics on the amount of fraud that exists in the asylum system.”
@AriFleischer But while we’re on the subject, I’ve asked White House/DHS officials for evidence to back up their claims that most asylum claims are fraudulent beyond citing the increased number of claims as prima facie evidence of widespread fraud. 		The thing is, that evidence doesn’t exist.
@AriFleischer There was a program to track people/families with GPS monitors while their asylum cases were pending so those who were denied could be removed. Cheaper than detention, few absconders. 		Trump administration killed it in June 2017.

@MitchKosterman 1. I’m not going out of my way. 	2. You’re conflating my pointing out inconsistencies in her public statements with personal attacks. Pointing them out is part of what I do. She’s in Congress, I’m a reporter. Its no different from what I do at the WH/on the Hill every single day.
Best she can do is that not passing the other bills is important “to have a negotiation,” aka so @realDonaldTrump can hold 800k federal workers’ paychecks, countless tax refunds, etc hostage for his campaign mnemonic device wall.
@MiekeEoyang Trump is definitely the outlier here. Even Nixon’s presidency was consequential in terms of domestic and foreign policy accomplishments, Watergate notwithstanding.
JUST NOW: @mercedesschlapp can’t tell me why separately passing each non-DHS appropriations bill is unacceptable now even though @realDonaldTrump said he wanted separate appropriations bills this year when he complained about having to sign a large omnibus spending bill last yr.

@PressSec No, Sarah. That’s not an “attack.” It’s a story about how your boss (like you and other White House staffers who’ve repeatedly violated the Hatch Act) has absolutely no compunctions about violating laws and regulations meant to ensure a nonpartisan military and civil service.
@jonfavs @ebfavs You know they make a reusable K-Cup, right?
@GPIngersoll You’re a retired/discharged Marine and you don’t understand how asking a candidate to autograph a picture is VERY DIFFERENT from asking a candidate to autograph a piece of paraphernalia bearing a campaign slogan WHILE IN UNIFORM? 		I have a hard time believing that.
To put it simply,		OK: a picture of Donald Trump, a Trump menswear collection necktie, a bottle of Trump Vodka, a Trump University diploma, a package of Trump Steaks, a box for “Trump: The Game,” etc (you get the idea).		NOT OK: ANYTHING with a campaign logo or slogan on it.
Seeing this bad take a lot from the usual folks, who are either deliberately being disingenuous or missing the simple distinction between asking a senator/candidate for POTUS to autograph a picture &amp; asking a president to autograph piece of slogan-bearing campaign paraphernalia. https://t.co/6RtsNgBy0T
So, friends, let’s throw the name @davidsirota up on the wall of block-happy cultists, joining (among others):		@peterdaou (remember @verrit?)	@SebGorka	@jacobawohl	@davidwohl	@freedom_moates
...then suddenly I become all sorts of bad things that have the words “neoliberal” or “establishment” in them.		At times like this it’s good to be reminded that the far-right does not have a monopoly on hating journalism or appropriating it for their own purposes.
...long as the cultists are culting for someone named Clinton or wearing MAGA caps. But when the cult du jour is the Church of Saint Bernie of Burlington &amp; not the Cathedral of the Blessed Non-Virgin Donald of Queens or the Holy Tabernacle of Our Pantsuited Lady of Whitehaven...
In other words, he cults just as hard as the @HillaryClinton and @realDonaldTrump cultists whose output I’ve taken notice of. 		I guess it’s ok for a journalist to note how politician-as-flawless-savior personality cults have been particularly destructive to our discourse, so...
Of course, I also noted that most of his output these days consists of often-equally-disingenuous attempted takedowns of whoever at the time is both not named @BernieSanders AND getting ink/airtime touting them as a potential 2020 frontrunner/progressive-wing favorite.
Wow. @davidsirota blocked me for noting that conflating a Texas(!) candidate’s acceptance of donations from individuals (voters) who work in the Texas oil industry with accepting oil lobbyist or PAC money in a story is either deliberately disingenuousness or sloppy incompetence. https://t.co/EHxdXAoHlo

@davidsirota @EricBoehlert Fine. On a scale of 1 to full-on Peter Daou, Eric is like a 4 or 5, maybe 6.

@dcbigjohn Is it strange that I actually wondered what happened in a fictional off-screen election that saw Arthur Branch defeat standard-issue liberal prosecutor Nora Lewin (Dianne Wiest)? I think the on-screen explanation was post-9/11 stuff.
@fiondavision “Oil Money” implies taking money from industry representatives, is PACs and lobbyist donations. It’s not remotely the same as what the story implies.
@fiondavision ie, deliberately not drawing a distinction between PAC or lobbyist money and money given by people who work for a given industry is just plain journalistic malpractice.
@fiondavision Also, my main issue with Sirota is that he cults hard. Also the story in question re O’Rourke is devoid of context and nuance, and therefore useless for informing one’s choice at the ballot box unless your worldview is limited to “DEATH PENALTY FOR HAVING ANYTHING TO DO WITH OIL”

@davidsirota @AoDespair My solution? Stop culting.
@davidsirota @AoDespair It’s almost a bizarro world version of Hillary cultists in 2008. 		And no, I don’t “shill” for anyone. I just don’t like the damage one septuagenarian with a personality cult has done to this country after battling it out w/ another septuagenarian w/ a personality cult.
@davidsirota @AoDespair The past is no guarantee of future performance and from my observations your TL reads exactly like a MAGA cultist except substitute Sanders for Trump,  “neoliberal” for “globalist,” etc. What’s scariest is that you’d probably rather lose w/ perfect than win w/ good.
For Mueller would be there, still with nary a leak, joined by Dems who’d be able to compel what they seek.		“It’s a WITCH HUNT!” Don cried, “NO COLLUSION! That’s right!”		“Happy shutdown! Build my wall or there’ll be no end in sight!”
And he tweeted and tweeted for day after day, with truth hardly present in the things he would say		But as 2019 came more and more near, it was obvious that POTUS had plenty to fear
“Tell Rushbo and Ann,” he said, “this wall is my fight, lest the House Freedom Caucus ditch me overnight,		That’s why I told Nielsen, no balloons or cameras at all — just go to the Congress and say ‘we need wall!’”
My base will cry MAGA, they believe what I say,  even when contradicted the very next day!”		He then slumped with arms crossed as if Merkel was there, and refused each Dem offer, no matter how fair.
“Now, Little Bob! Flakey! Nan-cy! Crying Chuck!		You’d better vote for my wall, ‘cuz I just don’t give a fuck,		about Swamp-rats and holdovers who want my defeat, I’ll shut it all down and put them on the street!
Not the praise or the credit his new friends got each day, from the state-run tv networks they made sure to pay.		So Don took up his smartphone and embarked on a course, of base-pleasing panders, insults and retorts:
“It’s Mohammed and Vlad and Recep who I trust, they’re strong leaders who praise me for doing what I must.”		Don then tried to relax in his TV-filled happy place, but he still found the news gave him no warm embrace.
“He’s fired,” Don snapped, “he’s a disloyal jerk!		“And you know who’s just like him?  That holdover, McGuirk!”		“They hate me so much that they want me to fail, not like my new friends who put reporters in jail”
When on the North Lawn there arose such a clatter, POTUS called for his agents, who promptly dismissed the whole matter:		“Sir, its just TV live shots! No danger to you, that is; Unless you’re counting news coverage of your letter from Mattis.”
The Congress had gone home to enjoy Christmas cheer, while furloughed employees eyed bank balances with fear.		And POTUS in his bathrobe with smartphone in hand, sat before his TV sending tweets forth to the land
So I continued what @aseitzwald started (this tweet has his words)		T'was the night before Christmas, when in the White House.	A creature was tweeting, with keyboard and mouse.	The shutdown continued, but he felt no one cared.	As he hoped that the Wall Money, soon would be there.

So the Obama Administration SETTLED THE CLAIM FOR A FRACTION OF WHAT THE TRIBUNAL WOULD HAVE REQUIRED US TO PAY. 		We refunded their money with interest. That is all. Sadly, @realDonaldTrump can’t stop lying about this. 		4/4
In 1981 we signed an agreement with Iran to settle claims and created a special court in The Hague for this purpose. Iran has a claim against us for that $400 million, and WE WERE GOING TO LOSE. BIGLY.		3/

SAO tells @MichelleDiana he’s “not here to articulate what the president will or not do” when asked if POTUS would veto bill with less than $5 billion.
“We want to make progress on border security that includes a physical barrier,” SAO says, leaves room for other methods that might fall under the definition of “border security”
“The President has been very clear” about the $5 billion number, SAO says, won’t say if POTUS would take the $1.6 batted about by GOP Senators.
SAO won’t address whether @realDonaldTrump would support the federal employee pay raise in some versions of funding the bill.
“We need to have $5 billion in physical barriers,” SAO says.
“It’s our hope that this partial shutdown only lasts for a few days,” the SAO says, notes it could be longer if @SenateDems do not “give”  administration their votes for wall funding.
The SAO has no good answer to an excellent question from @svdate on why @realDonaldTrump “isn’t shutting down the Mexican government” considering the oft-repeated promise that Mexico would pay for the wall.
SAO pushes back on the idea that federal employees are “pawns” in this dispute.
Won’t say if @realDonaldTrump would be willing to come off the $5bn number for wall funding, or how, if he’s not willing, any talks could be considered a “negotiation.”
JUST NOW: on conference call with reporters, a senior administration official can’t say whether the president invited any Democrats to lunch or why he only met with Republicans despite calling on Democrats to negotiate.

Bottom line: @PressSec refuses to brief us, when she does she arranges it to avoid taking more than a few questions before ducking out, and for most of us she’s totally unresponsive. 		Why is she in that job drawing $180k/yr salary if she won’t perform its essential functions?
@jlodge28 @BrianKarem Nope. Was me.
@ironstowetemp @BrianKarem Nope, was me
I’m not the only reporter who @PressSec has apparently decided is insignificant enough to ignore. By ignoring me and others like me, she effectively ignores those Americans who read our work and rely on us for news each day.
Now, one can argue that the White House press secretary has a limited amount of time and attention, and that she has to be judicious in how she allocates both. I wholeheartedly agree. 		But, but, BUT...
Her office also arranges invite-only pen-and-pad briefings with senior officials (Chief of Staff, Nat’l Security Adviser, etc) on occasion. 		I am at the White House nearly every day but do I ever hear about them before I see nearly every other reporter coming out of them? No.
Has a single one of those requests been granted in the year and a half she has been in the @PressSec job? Never.
I, like many other reporters for smaller outlets, am not part of the rotating “pool” of reporters who are permitted to pose questions to the president and other officials during so-called “pool sprays.” In theory we can still ask to be join the “pool” as “extras” for an event.
Do I ever get responses to my requests to speak with administration officials? Never. 		Do I get calls returned or answers to any other questions I am told to pose via email? Never.
@SeattleSportsPT @leahmcelrath As a proud @UWMadison graduate (go @UWBadgers ) I will readily admit to liking beer.
Do I get a response to that note? Never.
Since Sarah Sanders took over for @seanspicer as @PressSec MORE THAN A YEAR AGO I have not been able to get a single meeting with her despite my many requests. When I find her in her office she is invariably heading to a meeting and tells me to “shoot me a note.”
Many reporters who cover the White House work for smaller media outlets, and it’s clear the administration feels those reporters (including me) are not worth their time.

In the end, Republicans gave up wall funding, Dems gave up the subsidies, and a CR was passed and signed. 		Everyone was happy. Mulvaney briefed us and said it was a win for both sides. @chuckschumer and @Nancypelosi said something similar but noted how POTUS got no wall funding.
It was February 2017, Trump was a freshly minted POTUS who wanted his wall, Democrats wanted Obamacare subsidies (remember those?), Mick Mulvaney was the new OMB director and a shutdown was looming.

“I will take the mantle,” @realDonaldTrump says. 		Adds after that “we have a lot of people” who want to be his Chief of Staff (doesn’t seem that way).
Pelosi calls for an “evidence-based conversation” where she and Schumer won’t have to keep correcting him. Schumer and Trump begin arguing about who to blame last shutdown, Trump vows “I will shut down the government/I am proud to shut down the government” over the wall.
Trump says “this is a national emergency, drugs are pouring into our country from Mexico” (they’re not. Most drugs come in at ports of entry, a wall won’t stop them).
Trump points to his Senste victory, Schumer notes “when you’re noting you won North Dakota and Indiana you’re in trouble.”
Reporter asks if border security can be had without the wall, Trump says no. Schumer notes experts say you can do it w/o wall, which does not solve the problem. Trump replies “yes it will solve the problem.”
Trump flatly says “if we don’t have border security we aren’t going to keep the government open.”
.@chuckschumer weighs in, saying there is a bipartisan proposal to keep government open, Trump says “if there’s not border security I won’t take it.”
Pelosi notes there isn’t a majority in either chamber (GOP included) for the wall, Trump keeps blaming the need for Democrats to vote for cloture. Trump says “Nancy, I do [have the votes],” says “10 terrorists” caught at border (evidence? Not so much).
Pelosi thanks Trump for meeting, says “a shutdown is not worth anything and we should not have a Trump shutdown.”		Pelosi and Trump then argue about whether the GOP can get a funding bill passed on their own. Trump complaining that he needs Democratic votes in the Senate.
“It’s a tough issue because we are on opposite sides...but the wall will get built,” Trump says, adding “ask Israel” about the effectiveness of walls.

Worth noting that @votolatino is a nonpartisan organization.
Pichai says "we didn't encourage any such activity...we don't participate in partisan activity."		At the heart of what @Jim_Jordan is complaining about is Republicans' conviction that helping minority voters get to the polls is a partisan activity.
Ah, it's time for conspiracy theories with @Jim_Jordan -- he's complaining about emails from Google's head of multicultural marketing (he's almost spitting out the words) noting that Google encouraged Latinos to vote in "key states" (aka states with high Latino populations).

However, UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES should anyone address the Surgeon General of the United States (who most think of when they hear the title) or Surgeon General of the US Navy as “Admiral-General,” because that’s a fake title used by a ridiculous Sacha Baron-Cohen character. 9/9 https://t.co/VsdFY5oECd
Now, as to how to address the four federal officials w/ the title of Surgeon General, that’s a bit more complicated. While two of them (the Surgeons General of the Army / Air Force) are properly called “General,” two others surgeons general are called “Admiral” (really). 8/
On a similar subject, a MAJOR error many people make (and a HUGE pet peeve of mine) is addressing the Attorney General or Solicitor General as “General so-and-so.” It’s wrong and ridiculous. Don’t do it (I’m looking at you, SCOTUS). 7/
Speaking of ex-House members, former Speakers are not entitled to be called “Speaker” once they’re not anymore (sorry @newtgingrich ). 6/
Equally wrong are those who address ex-House members as “Congressman/Representative so-and-so,” as neither was a formal title in the first place.		But all ex-electeds and former Senate-confirmed officials (sorry not you @omarosa ) can use “The Honorable” for life. 5/
This is why post-White House, Dwight Eisenhower went by “General” once again, and Colin Powell became “General Powell” once he resigned as SecState.		Hence, journalists who address @HillaryClinton as “Secretary Clinton” instead of “Senator Clinton” are doing it wrong.		4/
It is, however, often done as courtesy for ex-presidents and ex-governors, but it’s not a rule.		Former senators, ambassadors, federal judges &amp; SCOTUS justices are properly addressed by title for life, as are retired military officers. 3/
...getting ridiculous and sycophantic, so let’s talk about titles for former officials.		The general rule is that with offices in which there is one holder at a time, former holders aren’t technically supposed to be addressed by the title. 2/

@jentaub @neeratanden Of course that would also mean giving up insider access in some cases, which for some is the only currency by which a reporter is judged these days (hence my current situation)
@jentaub @neeratanden There’s a different solution— we (news people) need to stop confusing balance with objectivity and stop being terrified of being smeared as “liberal” by folks who either don’t understand or just plain hate real, honest journalism.
@jentaub @neeratanden Because even if one manages to keep the headlines from having the disparate impact you’re talking about, one can’t pick and choose what news to report based on impact, at least if one is doing it right.
@jentaub @neeratanden Admittedly I responded to your first reply before the second was posted
@jentaub @neeratanden But headlines are an issue of style, not substance.
@jentaub @neeratanden Ok, so if I’m an editor and one of my reporters brings me a well-reported story about a potential presidential candidate and an issue that will undoubtedly be raised if that potential candidate runs, I should spike it due to how it might play because of the candidate’s gender?
@neeratanden 2020 is not 2016. Elizabeth Warren is not Hillary Clinton.  		Each candidate brings their own sui generis issues along with them when they start exploring a run.
@neeratanden Ok, Neera, I’ll bite. 		How is the Times — or any newspaper for that matter — supposed to report on any female Democrat with White House ambitions who happens to make a tone-deaf, self-sabotaging mistake, without being accused of either sexism or hagiography?

A reporter’s mission, as the Sage of Baltimore, H.L. Mencken said, is to “comfort the afflicted and afflict the comfortable.” We don’t always carry out that mission as well as we should (access is one hell of a drug, partisanship is equally strong and corrupting).
I note this because for me, the truth is an ideology in and of itself, which if  adhered to properly will anger both liberals and conservatives alike, depending on either who is in power or who is, as they say in Baltimore, doing the dirt. Sometimes it’s one and the same.

The most surprising thing in this wild story by @JulietLinderman is that @realDonaldTrump (who by many accounts wants to dismantle the civil service &amp; often sees career government employees as “deep state” enemies) actually nominated 2 people for the MSPB. https://t.co/8wPKbz9JEK

@GreatDismal Wow, thank you for reading.
Asked if he talked to @IvankaTrump about emails, says “her records are at the historical society.”
Says “everyone who leaves the Trump administration has come out really well,” cites Hope Hicks as example.
Now he’s repeating the absurd lie that China is “paying us billions of dollars a month” from tariffs.		Tariffs are paid BY AMERICANS.		Now says Matt Whitaker “is a highly respected, strong person.”
Another lie: “we’ve picked up trillions of dollars in value.”		Says he has made the US a tremendous economic power since taking office.
“I’ve helped to create a country that is doing better economically,” @realDonaldTrump says.
Now @realDonaldTrump says a December shutdown “could happen” over border security, attacks a judge “for taking law enforcement into his own hands,” calls ruling “shocking.” 		He’s again lying about having given an order to “shut down the border.”
He’s now telling @jdawsey1 that he will “close the border” if it can’t be “controlled,” says Mexico won’t be able to “sell their cars” (the cars are often American cars).
Suggesting Central American migrants in Tijuana are starting fights, in reality they were attacked. Says military can use lethal force (illegal under Posse Comitatus) and “over 500” are criminals. 		Also lies about “closing the border.”
He is now repeating that “nobody has done more for the military than I have,” says many generals have gone on TV to defend him (not true), adds that “nobody has done more for veterans” (he recently suggested vets w/ PTSD are weak).
“My policy is America First,” @realDonaldTrump says immediately after giving a obsequious, credulous defense of MBS.
Says without Saudis, we wouldn’t have a large base in Middle East (our main base is in Qatar, which the Saudis tried blockading), says Israel would have problems without Saudi Arabia, ignoring most of Israeli history.
Good on @jdawsey1 for pressing him on the @CIA “high confidence” assessment re MBS ordering the murder of Jamal #Khashoggi.
Incorrectly gives Saudi Arabia and himself credit for low oil prices, says price dropped because he called the Saudis.
Says litigants “can file at any place in the country” by filing suits in 9th Circuit, which any lawyer will tell you is absurd. Suggests that the military will not accept decisions made by American courts.
Now mispronounces “concertina wire” — twice in same sentence.
Now tells reporters 9th Circuit rulings are “very unfair to the people of our country, because I’m keeping them safe.”
Next breath he says “I know everything about what everyone is doing.”
Now he’s asking why the Reagan is forward-deployed, making it obvious he has no idea why.
He doesn’t get the answer he is looking for, as the Reagan’s captain replies to his crack about needing an “Albert Einstein” to run EMALS by noting the ship operates nuclear reactors.
Does it again with a Navy Captain.		He appears to have suggested the U.S.S. Gerald Ford will be heading to Hong Kong, is complaining about the EMALS catapults on the Ford, trying to prompt the USS Ronald Reagan’s captain to bash it.
He once again addresses a Colonel by first name.
“How are you finding things in Afghanistan right now?”		The commander-in-chief is making small talk with overseas-deployed troops. Asks her how many people she’s commanding, she answers, says it’s “fantastic,” “really beautiful.”
Addressing an Army Colonel by her first name, says “tell me a little about yourself...”
“There’s no brand like the coast guard that has gone up in the last couple of years,” he says, adding a recent hurricane “was more violent in terms of water than anything we’ve ever seen.”
Asks @USCG officer “how are they feeling about trade” in mid-east.
Now he’s ad-libbing about “having a very powerful border now,” says “we’re not letting anybody in, really.” Adds “we’re going to make sure they’re all the right people.”		Bashing the courts to the military. Says “it’s a terrible thing...a disgrace” for judges to rule on security.
This whole fiasco is just representative of absurdly poor planning. At the very least it would’ve been easy to set up a videoconference.
Describes Coast Guard’s work during hurricanes as “good branding.”		“The coast guard has really become a symbol of strength and perseverance and toughness and really, genius.”		Compares USGC “A” school to @Wharton School of Finance.
He appears to be reading from a script (with ad libs)
Pretty sure he just congratulated Air Force members on the call for “destroying hundreds of ISIS”
“Big big progress has been made” against ISIS, @realDonaldTrump says.
Oh my god @realDonaldTrump is currently on the phone with service members bragging about the economy and suggesting they are deployed to fight for the economy.

But please don’t equate a US drone strike on an AQAP member who was complicit in attacks on Americans both here and abroad with the Saudis choking and dismembering a journalist who displeased the Crown Prince. Anwar al-Awlaki wasn’t a dissident, he was an honest-to-god terrorist.
I also know that there’s a significant portion of the Trumpist GOP that doesn’t think killing a [muslim, noncitizen] journalist who wrote for a newspaper that often upsets the president is a big deal, or at least agrees with what @realDonaldTrump said for one reason or another.
Now, reasonable people can disagree about Obama and Bush’s use of drones for targeted killings, and one can argue that it was wrong to target an American citizen.
Anwar al-Awlaki was part of a terrorist group, Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, which later became ISIS. He was complicit in killing Americans outside the US &amp; preached to 9/11 hijackers		Jamal #Khashoggi was a Washington Post columnist who wrote mean things about Saudi royals https://t.co/w6ik7hDAoc

Both Peas and Carrots have been staying under armed guard at Washington, DC’s famed Willard InterContinental hotel while they await the president’s decision.		A @TheJusticeDept spox said the guards were provided for their protection, as the turkeys are not considered flight risks
Turkey’s president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan denied responsibility for the operation and invoked a phrase used by the late senator John McCain, R-Ariz, by describing Peas and Carrots as a pair of “wacko birds” who carried out a rogue operation.
Other charges allegedly listed on the indictment are for civil rights violations related to the death of one Harlan Sanders (no relation to @PressSec), whose body was found pecked to death after he’d been seen entering the Turkish embassy here in Washington.
Per administration officials, the turkeys whose clemency petitions are pending today are Peas &amp; Carrots.

Not only has the @realDonaldTrump White House pulled/denied hard passes to punish reporters they don’t like, they’ve approved them for people whose only qualification is sycophancy regardless of whether they work for legitimate news outlets or are working reporters.

@ChrisSheridan34 @onetruebritt @AJEnglish It also allows you to access the White House complex on short notice without having to wait in line to have your ID checked (sometimes more than once). Many events and locations are restricted to hard pass holders as well.
@YossiGestetner @whca @Acosta @CNNnewsroom @LevineJonathan @MZHemingway @JenniferJJacobs @christinawilkie @JaxAlemany The "hard pass" issued by the Secret Service is *only* supposed to be denied on account of a threat to the safety of the president or his/her family. That's the law.
@YossiGestetner @whca @Acosta @CNNnewsroom @LevineJonathan @MZHemingway @JenniferJJacobs @christinawilkie @JaxAlemany The entire reason for the Congressional press galleries' existence is the understanding that in the United States, the government is not supposed to decide who is and is not a journalist and therefore allowed the requisite access needed to report on government officials.
@ChrisSheridan34 @AJEnglish sorry, and *thinks* your colleagues shouldn't consider you one, either.
@ChrisSheridan34 @AJEnglish Here's one of the more important distinctions.

@stevenportnoy Yeah, but the press office can also just refuse to process an application because they don’t want to give someone a pass, like they’ve done with me.
This is news to me, as a particular press office staffer was adamant that the size of an outlet was part of the criteria when they denied my application, telling me that “hard passes are reserved for outlets of mass distribution.” https://t.co/YE7jrYT8rq

@BoutrousTed That hasn’t helped me at all, Ted. This White House denied my application for permanent credentials without formal notice, any written criteria or an opportunity to appeal. No one cared.

"While the suit is specific to CNN and Acosta, this could have happened to anyone," CNN said, and “would create a dangerous chilling effect for any journalist who covers our elected officials” if unchallenged.		Guess what @CNNPR — it DID happen to someone, me. No one said a word.
I’m glad @CNN is standing up for @Acosta &amp; a free press, but it would’ve been nice for these folks to have stood up for me when the @PressSec &amp; the White House refused to approve my application for permanent credentials because of the size of my employer.		https://t.co/cuygmC8WXb

@MilanowskiCarol @danwalterwriter @freedomcaucus And let’s be realistic about the effect of Pelosi/Hoyer/Clyburn keeping a stranglehold on the leadership for over a decade, specifically how it’s stunted the political growth of an entire generation of House Democrats who’ve had no chance to rebuild a deep bench since 2010 losses
@MilanowskiCarol @danwalterwriter Yes. They did make her a bogey[woman]. Have you seen her favorable/unfavorable numbers? GOP pols may be afraid of her effectiveness (especially compared to the way Ryan/McCarthy got bossed around by the @freedomcaucus) but what matters is how she’s a polarizing figure to *voters*

@EdKrassen @4gottenflapper @KimStrassel @oneunderscore__ You’re still missing the point, dude. It’s one thing to forward a threat you receive while working on a story. I’ve had that happen and so have many others. It’s another thing entirely to turn over everything you have &amp; in doing so become a participant. It’s about more than you.
@ABFalecbaldwin @realDonaldTrump Not commenting on the story’s veracity, just empathizing in light of the well-documented stresses that can come from doing what’s needed 2 skillfully perform certain characters for long periods, which would undoubtedly be difficult for a sensitive artist to endure over time...😉

@EdKrassen @4gottenflapper @KimStrassel @oneunderscore__ If you don’t understand why a legitimate reporter wouldn’t forward a tip s/he got to law enforcement (even an absurd hoax from an idiot) in hopes of getting that idiot in legal trouble, maybe you should ask someone like @BrianKarem since he’s gone to jail to protect the rights...
@EdKrassen @4gottenflapper @KimStrassel @oneunderscore__ Are you trying to change the subject or are you conflating passing threats made against one’s own life/family on to law enforcement (which I &amp; many other actual journos who cover Trump do) with deliberately tipping off Mueller’s office to the Wohl hoax (which you bragged about)?

You ask for comment, you don’t...
@4gottenflapper @EdKrassen @KimStrassel I’m not worried about anything except people getting the idea that a legitimate journalist would make themselves part of a story by “warning” law enforcement in hopes of a particular outcome (what Ed/Eric boasted of doing) rather than ask for comment (like @oneunderscore__  ).

He's been telling the same lie for months about family separation being an Obama policy
.@realDonaldTrump says asylum will only be offered to those who “lawfully present themselves at a port of entry," but U.S. law allows people to present themselves to border patrol.
He’s also lying about how other countries don’t offer asylum.
Wow, @realDonaldTrump is suggesting human trafficking "is at a level it's never been" going back 200 or 500 years. 		What about the Atlantic slave trade?
Now @realDonaldTrump is lying about how much heroin and fentanyl enters through the southern border.
Another lie is that asylum seekers don't show up for hearings. They show up.
Now he's lying about the Mexico-Guatemala border being "violently overrun"
“There’s a limit to how many people a nation can responsibly absorb into their societies," says @realDonaldTrump who appears to be channeling @SteveKingIA

That’s 45 minutes of my life I’ll never get back
Wohl says “we determined the accusation was credible.”
It’s *Carolyn* Cass, my apologies
