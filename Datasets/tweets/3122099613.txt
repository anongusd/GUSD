Our country can truly benefit by moving away from the old, job-killing model that the corporate lobby drafted, &amp; I will continue to urge the Administration to work toward a strong, trilateral deal that puts workers first. 3/3
As we review this bilateral agreement, I’ll be making sure we are raising wages for workers, safeguarding workers’ rights &amp; reducing outsourcing. Additionally, the deal needs strong enforcement protocols &amp; a timeframe for American workers to review the terms of the agreement. 2/3
Any trade deal must first &amp; foremost benefit American workers. 		Our workforce clearly suffered from #NAFTA, &amp; in #SouthJersey alone 19,500 manufacturing jobs have been lost since NAFTA came into force, which is simply unacceptable. 1/3

I captured the @CNNPolitics countdown clock with one second to go before the #TrumpShutdown.		By the time you read this, the Federal Government will officially be shut down. Very sad day for America. https://t.co/n7ItlaaUGN
Last year President Trump tweeted the ‘country needs a good shutdown’ &amp; today, sadly, he got his wish.	 	Republicans control the House… the Senate… &amp; the White House. There is no doubt that full responsibility for this shutdown rests solely on their shoulders.	#TrumpShutdown https://t.co/MfZIaQiNiB
Opioid overdose deaths increased by 28%, but they're suggesting cutting funds by 95%?!		Don't they realize there's an #OpioidCrisis?!		We need MORE resources to fight this epidemic, not less. We're losing loved ones to the disease of addiction!		https://t.co/zkHLlxhuHO
This photo from my daughter sums up how I feel today. 		A government shutdown because we are trying to help children?! Come on. We can do better than this. #SaveCHIP #DREAMActNow https://t.co/s9RhrJUe0i

This is heartbreaking. The #NYCTerroristAttack was a terrible, cowardly act that took one of NJ's own. https://t.co/vY00RLp11M
It's crazy to give billions to billionaires instead of raising wages for full-time working Americans. 5/5
Over 250,000 people in the counties I represent will lose a critical tax deduction they rely on. That's not "tax reform." That’s a tax hike for NJ’s families. 4/5
Even w/changes, the #BillionairesFirst tax bill is paid for by hardworking #NJ families. By eliminating the state income tax deduction, Republicans are still double-taxing NJ. (See:'Jersey residents lose big under new Trump-House Republican tax bill' https://t.co/4KUL6ApMRy) 3/5
The #BillionairesFirst tax bill does nothing to create jobs, raise wages &amp; bring real relief for taxpayers. Instead, it prioritizes corporate profits &amp; screws working families. 2/5

There are 150+ lawyers👨‍💼 in Congress &amp; only 1 electrician👷— don't need to be a lawyer to see @POTUS's reckless tweets look like slander⚡️
Fourth, in some cases, the plaintiff must prove special damages. (Attempting to malign @POTUS44 and also hurting country's reputation ✔)
Third, the plaintiff must prove that the publisher acted negligently (6am tweet w/o talking to intel and with no evidence = negligence ✔)
Second, the plaintiff must prove that the defendant made an unprivileged publication to a third party. (Twitter/The World = Third Party ✔)
First, the plaintiff must prove that the defendant made a false and defamatory statement concerning the plaintiff (Intel says no wiretaps✔)
To prove slander or libel, plaintiffs must prove the following four elements:

Same is true for the government’s budget &amp; Trump's exposes his true priorities — help for billionaires at the expense of working Americans.
