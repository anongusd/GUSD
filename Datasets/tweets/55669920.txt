@robbystarbuck @BetteMidler This IS NOT a fake stat spread by far left activists!

Other high #'s 194 for 6 mos. includes everything! Stat 101!
@BetteMidler Gun Violence Archive published these #'s which are overstated &amp; Newsweek reprinted, Mother Jones posted another # understated, Politifact states 63% white males commit the mass shootings. NO extreme left wing group lied it's statistics 101 definition varied by study.
@robeva1495 @Mountaind3w @StarliteNicole @robbystarbuck @BetteMidler The definition matters because we are using statistics to make important decisions &amp; if it's not considered a mass shooting you cannot include in the #'s!

@_centrist_ @_journaling_ @riseup1moretime He did say that he had the right to touch her &amp; he could throw her on the ground &amp; rape her. BUT was cut off when he was going to say something about the Supreme Court, I'm assuming it was the protection we give rapist that aside he was too aggressive &amp; he apologized at the end.

@splinteredca @atheistic_1 @Givemeham Don't be ridiculous you could not come out and say you were an atheist, you know what the church would do, so it is apples and oranges! With separation of church and state and freedom of religion and speech we will be able to see in the near future the effects.
@splinteredca @atheistic_1 @Givemeham I know you didn't, I added, because if you're going to talk about Stalin &amp; that group of people most people would add Mussolini &amp; Hitler. Both were raised as devout Catholics so why would you leave them off? The main ones that are Christians for sure, kind of shady.
@splinteredca @atheistic_1 @Givemeham #atheism is a new thing so in our history religion, power, land, wealth, etc. causing wars is all mixed together, there is no separating it as you would have been murdered if you spoke against the church  even with scientific proof like the Earth rotating around the Sun.
@splinteredca @atheistic_1 @Givemeham What's upsetting about this to you? There's no difference they're both doing terrible things, so what if ones for power or ones for ideology who cares! As they are terrible people doing terrible things. As usual all the focus is on the wrong things!
@splinteredca @atheistic_1 @Givemeham Hitler was VERY much a "good" Christian.
@splinteredca @atheistic_1 @Givemeham All communist &amp; fascist gov't suppress religion of all kinds. That is because they have to have all loyalty to the collective.

@PaulinAjax @susanc66 @SpeakeasyJames Overhead is a possible factor when manufacturers make a decision to move their plants overseas but the primary reason US companies move is labor costs as we have had strong unions until recently.

But all we had to do was forget about Caravans that weren't true not pay for walls and Homeland Security that came out of a lie! Look we don't want committees on things we know about we want action on things like living wages, climate control, real things to be done.
Our grandchildren, great-grandchildren, great-great-grandchildren all living creatures big &amp; small, everything that is alive then or will have ever lived or ever would have possibly lived till the end of time because now we are like Venus on planet Earth the end!
Most importantly if we keep digging up all the carbon that it took millions &amp; millions of years to decay then release it back over just a couple 100 yrs into the atmosphere it's going to become so thick that we're going to become like Venus so we will not only have killed all..
Yes we have problems it's income gaps like billionaires in comparison to homeless people, no living wage, all the people without insurance, climate change climate deniers, you know all the things that Democrats are supposed to stand for that they don't, the way we treat our food!
It seems like he's saying we're going to have problems from Mexico, you're saying we're to have problems from the the bad Hombres or terrorist within? But it seems the same coin but just heads or tails you know the real problems here let's not play games anymore with each other.
@TeamPelosi @NancyPelosi @SenSchumer I stood up for you that you should be majority leader, I'm very disappointed that you told @realDonaldTrump that he couldn't have $ for wall because you needed it for Homeland Security? This is a democracy only 28% about care about that wall!
@robreiner @TapestryofPeace I can't stand them he says the wall is built for the people that voted for him so they'll be happy then he says the wall is not built we need the money to build the wall so they'll vote for him in 2020 there just morons &amp; only 28% isn't this democracy why are we appeasing them?
Well of course if it wasn't for guns there's tigers, lions, bears, oh my LOL sharks, wolves, coyotes, hippos ( which still kill 400 something people a year) I can go on and on all day LOL https://t.co/qaSj8GNHLN

I'm so sick &amp; tired of your diversions, I thought Mexico was paying for this wall, then I hear you on the phone with their President telling him just lie you just need him to tell the American people that to keep you out of hot water really, WTF!
@realDonaldTrump I don't know if you realize this but we live in a democracy &amp; only 28% of the population want you're stupid wall so that means it should be put on the back burner no matter what your's &amp; @LindseyGrahamSC  stupid temper tantrums say.

My grandmother doctor was convicted of negligent homicide in civil court and was supposed to pay millions of dollars in Damages but his assets in the same way.
Doctor's kill their patients through negligent homicide a lot &amp; there patients families are awarded multimillion-dollar lawsuits they just declare bankruptcy but before that they put their assets in family members names they don't pay anything so this happens all the time. https://t.co/MaYG6giIR4

@sarahsalviander @Jandrewgotsguns The fact that you are claiming that more scientists are religious than not just shows that science and religion are separate just like church and state are supposed to be. Anything discovered by science literally any God would have had to follow that path to create you.

@VABVOX @davidsiders @BetoORourke I myself was very pissed off at white women that just didn't like Hillary so they either didn't vote or directly voted for Trump, which not voting or voting independent is a vote for Trump as I tried to explain to them BUT a woman doesn't need to win just because she's a woman.
@VABVOX @GodrycDurcentel @stedanchick @dix_iechick @davidsiders @BetoORourke I'm assuming it means you were being flippant about the work he did to win/lose the senate seat in TX they were contrasting how difficult a road he followed rather than running in a friendlier state ie CA.

Animals were legally considered property because of livestock if you steal or otherwise damage livestock there could be a dollar value put on it but those laws were made a very long time ago and I know there's a better way we do not nor cannot own another living creature!
We need real consequences all over the world for atrocities like this just because you're the guardian of an animal does not mean that you can do this we have to change laws to reflect that they are not our property as you can do or dispose of property as you wish in the US! https://t.co/QVs8D7MpKw

@CyrusShares @dekofler @teh_maxh @KarenAttiah So now you're here you're going to be like every other a****** trumptard seriously after the opportunity you've been given we were all given at some point even the Native Americans if you go far enough back! The Middle East is not on our border so your process was different!
@CyrusShares @teh_maxh @KarenAttiah You should educate yourself before making comments because we are using this over a border into another country how could you call that riot control where do you get your definitions from your ass so until they get here it is not a riot on our soil for us to control with teargas!
@CyrusShares @KarenAttiah Since the chemical agent is being used over our border into another country it is prohibited by the Geneva Convention whether you want to call it a chemical weapon or not. Additionally where do you get the vast majority applying/swarming for Asylum are adult males? Your gut?
RT @agunn: @robsteinman123 @KarenAttiah Wrong. https://t.co/d1ZdSn1RVd
@agunn @robsteinman123 @KarenAttiah We are not using it on our own citizens but citizens of a foreign country! So absolutely &amp; prohibited!
This tweet sounds reasonable, initially, but remember we are using this tear gas against a foreign Nation so it is war like not law enforcement like at all! So until they get into this country we can't impose our law enforcement regulations on citizens of another country! https://t.co/OgV0EIAIFa
@Duncan_Bell @KarenAttiah @ericgarland @counterchekist @TrueFactsStated I hear what you're saying but we're using this against a foreign country which makes it war like and not like law enforcement at all!
@KarenAttiah I figured that's why you *chemicalweapons* correct me if I'm wrong because while it is not the same thing it's the step before that, you know he has no problem going there either!

@MARKSGRANDMA @juliettekayyem @AmoneyResists Really &amp; what does that exactly mean?
@realDonaldTrump  getting his way to become like Russia, North Korea &amp; China what we've always aspired to, apparently. So we have government-run news channels, militarized borders, gassing children now all we need is his military parade/president for life then he will be set! https://t.co/4mThfLJjsv
@RealMichaelTee @juliettekayyem @RumorsandRants The original tweet was pretty clear what is it you don't understand?
@bleu__denim @juliettekayyem Also having basically government-run news channels is North Korea and Russia correct?
@HSFBfan15 @juliettekayyem @Jali_Cat Really show us the proof WTF but even if @BarackObama did, which he didn't, so what! You're saying that because Obama did it @realDonaldTrump #NotMyPresident can do it, wow messed up logic, you right trumptards really are not good science, are you.
@Josh79315695 @juliettekayyem So what if @BarackObama separated children from their parents, which he did not, we're talking about #NotMyPresident @realDonaldTrump this is just a distraction perpetrated by the right you know when they start blaming everyone else that's what they've done!
@WesleyGripes @Yesterday_Paper @juliettekayyem @BlueWave201 Who cares if Obama put kids in cages which he absolutely did not he's not up for election 2020 so WTF! Again @realDonaldTrump said that immigrants were coming over with stolen children to be sold in the US to pedophile rings  on TV many, many times!
@CouceIgnacio @sharonwhotweets @juliettekayyem I watched most of this video it's just clips that have been sliced together  by right it doesn't prove anything except he wanted to get a conversation started which your own video clearly states. I'm so sick of people &amp; their agendas caring nothing about doing the right thing!
@CouceIgnacio @sharonwhotweets @juliettekayyem I would say how ridiculous you are a except joining in October 2018 who knows if you're a bot or what you are but ridiculous tweets are really what you are so far!
Do you believe this s*** WTF! https://t.co/SCfhFdswQ6
@WesleyGripes @BMPinault @juliettekayyem That's ridiculous where's the proof for that! I was alive when he was on TV talking about the separation policy that they were protecting these children because they weren't with their actual parents but pedophiles who are going to sell them in the US really WTF you wake up!
@tammy1667 @juliettekayyem And people keep letting him do it so a narcissistic compulsive liar what do they do they keep doing it as it works for them so why would they do anything different when it's all about them and they have no empathy or emotion for how other people feel!
@Oddly_Thing @juliettekayyem Keeping his story straight is such a joke I've never seen anyone so horrible at doing so lying on camera in one sentence then telling you the truth in the next &amp; back &amp; forth &amp; back &amp; forth LMAO but not really funny but sarcastically funny. SAD!
@billmaher said it best during the debate when she stated a fact all he would say is wrong she should have called b******* on that and then said let's go to tape! Of course they wouldn't have done that but I would have made it known that I would be showing it after the debate!
This is why @realdonaldtrump cannot be reelected in 2020 as he is a proven narcissistic compulsive liar and that is a documented fact so all we have to do is go to the video over &amp; over &amp; over again but either people don't care or they don't believe it WTF! https://t.co/K68qfHXOTa
@noybsk2017 @juliettekayyem That's why I don't want him impeached Electoral College put them in office so that's what it is I want him put in prison after he's gone in 2020 a real prison for human rights abusers he should actually be tried for treason!
@LisaMoraitis1 @juliettekayyem All he does is lie and lie! They elected a narcissistic compulsive liar! I would say this country gets what it deserves but we have to pay to when the majority of Voters didn't vote for him now we can't even get rid of the Electoral College because of deviant @BretKavarnaugh!
@chunkymonkysmom @juliettekayyem @nycsouthpaw @realDonaldTrump @BarackObama If he's not blaming @BarackObama then he's blaming at @HillaryClinton! You're absolutely right @realDonaldTrump is not a man he's a sexual deviant &amp; a narcissistic compulsive liar! What disgusts me now he wants to get everything to his lackey @BrettKavanaugh!
@RonnieCasaii @juliettekayyem @nycsouthpaw Thank you that's what he does!
@juliettekayyem @aravosis This is why @realdonaldtrump has to go because he is a narcissistic liar, actually a compulsive liar, he lies when the truth would be better! Then he tells the truth in one-sentence turns around &amp; lies in the next, then tells the truth, then lies WTF this is all within minutes!
@ryannicholos @aravosis Can you imagine how bad it must be for them where they come from to go through a sewage filled River after walking all that time just to get to a country that has armed military on the border wall + @realDonaldTrump talks hate speech constantly, it must be really bad!
@TimmyWait @aravosis You're awesome I agree @realDonaldTrump should do that because remember he's a real super sluice, Bonafide Sherlock Holmes LMAO!
So I think the best decision @realDonaldTrump has made is that he doesn't get to make the decision, isn't that a good thing? https://t.co/NS1Kgxkt7S
@docholly @LA_Karma1 Pretty sure none of my fellow Liberals are going to agree with me on this but I'm glad he gave the troops the ability to make their own decision about what kind of forced to use because that way he's not making it, look on the bright side!

We do not live in the ocean/we cannot survive in the ocean so we cannot own it we all have aconsiderable steak in what happens to the oceans! It is an ecosystem which then affects everything you can't over fish in Australia or Japan &amp; expect it to  stay Regional, WTF!
All we have to do to restock the ocean is 1. realize the oceans cannot belong to a country or a person so if the fishing industry takes out they must put back 2. we could do an inch per foot or what marine biologists + industry thinks is feasible because this is ridiculous, WTF!
You better hurry up before we kill everything in the ocean! I'm not being dramatic or exaggerating either we take millions of just sharks for example out of the ocean for their fin &amp; only five attack us every year! Why can't we make large commercial fisherman put back baby stock https://t.co/xkStspsfeB
It's just sad that he lied straight to their face! This is to the people that provide our life, food is life, don't forget these are not rich people that can afford to play these games. @realDonaldTrump get your shift together, lol! https://t.co/e8IHYPmi2a

@jackdre02 Whenever I'm on YouTube watching a movie or show about the universe/physics I'm always getting Christians on there trumpeting their religion when it's not a religious show this is when I get into arguments with you people. I do not go to videos about your religion.
@D1juny @jackdre02 what you would call three are actually 4 groups, liberal &amp; feminist aren't the same, groups of people all of them rude when I guess me asking you why you believe in a white man's religion that was forced on you through slavery might be considered rude but I am curious?
@Frieddodo @jackdre02 That is an excellent observation because I've had people stand for hours explaining to me in detail every aspect of their belief system and when I say simply well I don't believe in any religion I am immediately attached and told to be quiet in front of the children!

@jubalfh No I am only trying to point  that a group of people are trying to tell me, a member of the community that is being offended apparently,  stop using a word because I'm offending who myself like I said who here is mentally disabled I am so I would be offending myself ridiculous!
@llcycore @Lollardfish Well having been in the mental hospital about 5 x's I am part of that community being told by a group of people NOT a part of the community what offends us,  does no one see how bizarre that is?
@bethmv Also how many of you morons wasting my day are actually disabled?  So WTF are you doing speaking for another community?
@bethmv @PeripateticMe @StarryEyed48 @freeandclear1 @JamiJm @Lollardfish @B52Malmet @MightyMousebb You're all a bunch of bully's trying to get me to stop using a word &amp; your all to blind to even see how ridiculous &amp; pointless this entire conversation is. This is why nothing important gets done you want to do the easy things so you can feel good about yourself right away!
@jubalfh You PC police aren't going to come quoting an archaic def. from over a 100 yrs ago when in the last 50 yrs context was actual def. so it's the principle you can't tell other people what to say &amp; even resort to bullying me so I'll give in &amp; agree with you not going to happen!

@sandrockcstm @Lollardfish What are you even talking about I never rejected any reality about the Holocaust or whatever it is you're talking about I'm talking about the actual definition of a word so to tell me to go f*** myself right off a cliff that says something about you!
@mattsiegel Well you're actually agreeing with me because the word has NEVER been used the way she's portraying it to have been. You're too young to even know you weren't here yet but if I told my sister you were a moron she would know exactly what I was talking about, a really stupid person
@Lollardfish I know the history of the word so I don't have to think hard about it it means a really stupid person, you guys are acting like morons, you know a really stupid person!
@Lollardfish NO that is not the history of the word she's pulling something off the internet that never applied we've been saying that for 48 yrs &amp; it's what the definition says it is a very stupid person! The archaic definition she pulled has not applied during my entire life!
@Lollardfish YES words have meanings &amp; the meaning of this word is a very stupid person it has nothing to do with all the s*** you're talking about to killing people are you kidding me way off the deep end that's why they're calling us snowflakes we have bigger things to worry about or I do!
@mattsiegel So what's it about then? The real definition has nothing to do with what she is saying.  I am a lot older than you &amp; can say over the last 45 yrs.  when used in a sentence it follows "real" definition!
@Lollardfish I don't care! She is not disabled but speaking on behalf of disabled people SO being one myself I am speaking for us also. If I can't speak for us SHE certainly can't!
I cannot believe you have people commenting that the word moron could hurt a disabled persons feelings!?! Definition,  "A really stupid person. " they should have his picture there! He is a MORON! https://t.co/tcflLB1bOe
@B52Malmet YES MORON literal definition, "Very stupid person!" nothing to do with some archaic usage the PC police are trying to attribute to it so they can add another word to the LIST of words we're not allowed to say! WTF no way!
PC police WTF I  will say whatever I want you can't pull up an archaic use for a word then tell me not to use it because your disabled child might be offended! Moron defined "very stupid person" literal definition &amp; for my almost 50 years the only definition! https://t.co/85HBKDT1Xo
@StarryEyed48 @freeandclear1 @JamiJm @Lollardfish @B52Malmet @MightyMousebb She is leaving off the ACTUAL  definition which is a very stupid Person! When did ppl become so sensitive to every little perceived ouchie! Come on! He is a fucking moron! I am also disabled &amp; do not take offense SHE is not disabled but trying to speak for someone that is!
@freeandclear1 @B52Malmet @MightyMousebb No definition is a very stupid person which fits him perfectly it might have been used for mentally disabled person but I'm almost 50 &amp; we've always said it regarding a really stupid person so ppl shouldn't be so sensitive. I'm also disabled and I say it about very stupid people!

I really hate these people I hate all bullies with small penises why else would they do this shit
He needs to be executed! Period! Death to all poachers &amp; "big game hunters"! Try to go to certain areas of preservation with a weapon &amp; they shoot you on site, YAY, &amp; since 7.6 BILLION OF US are killing EVERYTHING that is how it should be. Not talking about sustenance hunting.ü§¨ https://t.co/hwOUb9b4bu
I am so sad for the families of these innocent victims that he used to take out his rage on or make a statement whatever it is I have NO sympathy for him. IF these thoughts were coming to me I would drive to the nearest hospital &amp; tell them to help! Say you feel suicidal anything https://t.co/PndArE61iN
Oh no I didn't think about all the damage he will now try to do in these 2 months! ü§¨ https://t.co/9bloqNWnS0

I think I have been too calm, if that's possible for me, we are not making enough head way to get people to understand that even though the forests used to be scary &amp; the big animals used to eat us we are the BULLIES now for being so called intelligent/enlightened beings we fail! https://t.co/wrXmxzABJH

I must say I have never been prouder to call MI my hometown, great job to everyone on voting day! I have been telling everyone on social media all the way to Obama &amp; #NotMyPresident how great we are! ‚Äî feeling proud
This is wonderful! I have always dreamed of running off &amp; volunteering/working for a wildlife preservation! I hate bullies &amp; since we are so powerful monopolizing the planet it is our responsibility to take care of it as it has nurtured us! We need to get past the past really! https://t.co/JnSCSYXQbE
How can we fix all the damage that is being &amp; has been done? I wish our next president could undo @BrettKavanaugh NO FBI investigation can be done in a week also don't we have any laws protecting people from people like Sessions? So much done improperly under executive order! https://t.co/TAWsCGr1vx
RT @Rainmaker1973: Camille Seaman travels the world capturing fleeting moments of power in diverse landscapes. From melting icebergs at bot‚Ä¶
Why can we not accept that we have won, beaten the scary forests &amp; animals that ate us &amp; now switch gears being enlightened beings we say we are &amp; take care of the planet &amp; animals that have also sustained us! Everything else is the underdog &amp; we are now the bullies! https://t.co/dYyUOD14JC
Even though many deny climate change &amp; anything regarding the environment that interferes with their incessant greed we MUST keep that in mind when they open their mouth! China is trying to claim part of THE OCEAN as theirs! We cannot own the oceans, WTF people! https://t.co/HP11cIaYr4
I doubt any billionaires will be reading MY tweets BUT if you are somewhere in you MUST realize that you do not deserve that much when the people that worked for you have NOTHING! The real people reading this we have to realize these people are nothing special just greedy!
I don't care if the last 50 ancestors of yours worked 24/7 for hundreds of years or what you have accomplished their are 7.6 billion people on this planet why should you not be made responsible for this horrible poverty &amp; desperate situations you created then left for us!
The real criminals are the companies that made millions/billions of $'s of the back of these workers for 5 generations even &amp; that is all they know is coal or manufacturing WHICH IS NEVER COMING BACK reality check! I live in MI I know BUT no one deserves billions of $'s https://t.co/ekKk441SaF
@rrosie240 Unfortunately this can be true BUT I need to get past my anger at these #NotMyPresident voters &amp; blame the true criminals that made billions off these 5th generation workers then skipped state &amp; left them with nothing! Tax these billionaires &amp; educate these people!
@MsRompess @rrosie240 @SecNielsen @DHSgov @USCIS @CBP @ICEgov @POTUS @FoxNews @GOP @BarackObama @tedlieu @TheRickWilson @Trevornoah @StephenAtHome @agschneiderman @JerryBrownGov @KamalaHarris @mcuban @JeffBezos @ACLU @elonmusk @jimmykimmel Manufacturing, coal, lead, asbestos etc. IS NOT COMING BACK! So let's stop blaming, myself included, 5th or more generation workers that is all they know &amp; tax the people that made billions off of them &amp; educate them with that $ then maybe they could contribute in a healthier way
Typical @realDonaldTrump all the questions regarding the upcoming shitstorm regarding investigations &amp; how things will change now that he is not in complete control caused him to go fire Sessions blaming him for recusing himself, as he should have! The one good thing he has done! https://t.co/1jmGlcyRhb
@amyklobuchar @Spartan2dn It seems to me that after @realDonaldTrump spoke on the midterms he started panicking because of all the questions regarding changes with investigation since he no longer controls everything so of course he just goes off!
@gphxgphx @realDonaldTrump @BrettKavanaugh Send a link to this story &amp; I will look at it as I have not forgotten I just do not know of it?
@gphxgphx @jonstewartbooks @realDonaldTrump Don't worry we're glad you left MI as well! Also I am not a Democrat nor a Republican but since sexual assault victims are portrayed as liars so the sexual deviants can continue with THEIR life I am now with the Dems so one of those swing votes lost! I do not support liars!
@FlipItBlueUSA @realDonaldTrump @BrettKavanaugh I actually thought @Acosta just bumped her on accident as he was so focused on his job he did not realize someone was trying to jerk his mic out of his hand! But great point!
Mental illness is a very small % of these people &amp; PTSD even lower but it is the main issues, anything other than the mostly white angry men that have had everything for so long &amp; still mostly do but cannot stand the fact we are all finally standing up for ourselves! https://t.co/Yr1YXZ9y3s
Great job MI I have never been more proud than I am right now not only to call MI my home town but also to be an American! We can all stop Gerrymandering, voter suppression &amp; the incarceration policy our government has held for way too long! We proved that, again great job! https://t.co/Pxkrsga0fl
@jonstewartbooks I am actually so proud of my home state MI! We stopped voter suppression, Gerrymandering &amp; legalized weed on the same day! ALSO 94% &amp; more voted against the hate machine that is #NotMyPresident #NobodyIsAboveTheLaw @realDonaldTrump great job!
We cannot listen/believe ANYTHING that #NobodyIsAboveTheLaw @realDonaldTrump that consistently supports sexual deviants, @BrettKavanaugh, calls the victims out like Dr. Ford BUT NOW he must protect the little girl that put HER HANDS on Jim because Drumpf was being a baby! https://t.co/bn4XoZ6yz5
@happystalker @SarahKSilverman @StephenAtHome @Trevornoah @jimmykimmel @billmaher @perlmutations I am with @CNN &amp; @Acosta on this #NobodyIsAboveTheLaw @realDonaldTrump so don't defend sexual deviants like @BrettKavanaugh then try to say Jim did something inappropriate when YOU instigated it then SHE put her hands on him multiple times he barely noticed her was not aggressive
@tdokester @Oprah @BarackObama @JerryNadler @robreiner @BetteMidler @Acosta @StephenAtHome I am with @CNN &amp; @Acosta on this! #NotMyPresident #NobodyIsAboveTheLaw @realDonaldTrump defends sexual deviants always like @BrettKavanaugh that we are stuck with now &amp; he is an old white man so no worries for him &amp; that is ALWAYS is the important factor let us not forget that!
@light_and_lit @colbertlateshow @StephenAtHome Absolutely LOVE your Q! I have been wondering the same thing but most people seem to think EVERYTHING is in some way about them or only seen through their perspective so everyone must think as they do.
Of course! https://t.co/zJerP1EkZ7
This is the reputation he has earned over many years by everyone that has ever knows him states to be true,unlike the hateful criminals he has to speak of on his show. I cannot see/imagine someone like Stephen associating with someone like Drumpf!
AS IF! Video of course not available! But "I'm sorry you know come on my show." Ha, ha is NOT apologizing to the "Just grab em' by the pussy!" guy #NotMyPresident #NobodyIsAboveTheLaw @realDonaldTrump Stephen is a great comedian/journalist/husband/friend, unlike others! https://t.co/GtDqLr6gxF
@DerekKreiner @BlacksForTrump5 @dotnetchris @StephenAtHome WTF! Oh that video is not available! I watch every single second of his show &amp; IF that was said it was jokingly like, "Hey, I'm sorry come on my show." You know ha, ha! Yes Fake News as the man with the most words &amp; the biggest brain (China says so) "Grab em by the pussy" guy!
@sarge38a @StephenAtHome President Clinton @BillClinton having consensual relations is NOT the same thing as mr "Just grab 'em by the pussy" guy! @realDonaldTrump would be dating his own daughter, makes disgusting comments on little girls, defends sexual deviants &amp; visits Miss. America dressing rooms etc
@ThePlumLineGS @alastairjallen1 @Acosta I am with @CNN &amp; @Acosta for standing up to lies &amp; defending truth! People don't like it when you call bullshit on them especially if they are little babies with daddy didn't love me enough or whatever issues. NO MORE!
@realDonaldTrump will say something in one sentence &amp; in the next one tell us the other was a lie! Why would we be surprised! I am sick &amp; tired of people trying to change reality for their own demented purposes then acting like were the crazy ones! NO MORE! https://t.co/rZgMnhQquI
@quintabrunson @hasanminhaj Absolutely! I have always loved him on the Daily Show but having the platform to voice his personal experience is wonderful &amp; fresh, the best thing to happen in a while in this @realDonaldTrump hell we are in!
Love to hear about wonderful teachers! Thanks! https://t.co/PZ39Viw3hk
Fantastic congratulations! https://t.co/K4cAkGRMcX
@hasanminhaj is truly a role model on how to handle this hostile environment we have been led into by old/prideful/ rich or pretend rich white men that have been in power to long! They take it for granted &amp; do not represent us! https://t.co/risO8QCBi3
Not only is the show enlightening/entertaining/funny etc. @hasanminhaj is truly a wonderful caring person &amp; with the environment we have in this country because of @realDonaldTrump #NotMyPresident Hasan is truly an inspiration &amp; a perfect role model of the American Dream!
I have pasted a copy of my reply to NPR this is a must watch show for everyone! Also watched him on "What Do You Bring to The Table?" truly inspiring &amp; the host is amazing also highly recommend this show as well thanks @hasanminhaj for introducing me to him &amp; his show! https://t.co/ePNFzSnzvq
@NPR Not only is the show enlightening/entertaining/funny etc. @hasanminhaj is truly a wonderful caring person &amp; with the environment we have in this country because of @realDonaldTrump #NotMyPresident Hasan is truly an inspiration &amp; a perfect role model of the American Dream!
Please get well fast &amp; live long &amp; prosper! For yours &amp; our sake we cannot have @realDonaldTrump appointing another sexual deviant that he loves to protect @BrettKavanaugh to the Supreme Court when he then attacks @Acosta for NO reason! https://t.co/597YzlXUfG
@cnnbrk Were in big trouble I heard one of them say that, he couldn't remember her name but said we know it, retires or dies @realDonaldTrump #NotMyPresident would get to appoint another (sexual deviant @BrettKavanaugh) &amp; that would be great for them! WTF is wrong with people!
@exoticgamora @wesley_jordan @TrinityResists @StormResist @DearAuntCrabby @BatmanResist @CaptainsLogAz @TheSWPrincess @Elastigirl2018 @DanaScottLO @ybbkaren No WHY GOD WHY!
@Acosta @RVAwonk I am with you all the way now following! @realDonaldTrump defends sexual deviants like @BrettKavanaugh but claims you went to far they must defend the poor little girl that put her hands on you multiple times 1st you were not even paying attention to her! He got his excuse!
I am with @CNN &amp; @Acosta! I watched it live &amp; many times since then she put her hands on him multiple time 1st after @realDonaldTrump started the problem #NotMyPresident They defend sexual predators like @BrettKavanaugh but Jim went to far, WTF! Drumpf looking for excuse! https://t.co/ffe3CxzH7a
If anyone can help? I wish I could help them all but already have 4 rescues! https://t.co/gtY87Gta87
Absolutely! BUT she touched him first multiple times he was focused on his question! These people like @realDonaldTrump support Kavanaugh a sexual deviant &amp; many others but go after this with a hard on, PLEASE, WTF! They do not care about women, mr "grab 'em by the pussy" man! https://t.co/dkjuOpVIrJ
@splashy79 @jamiehwood @YahooziePoppinS @drewharwell Yes you can see, I watched it live &amp; several times since, that he was not being aggressive towards her AT ALL! She touched him multiple times first #NotMyPresident was just looking for an excuse to ban him!
Wonderful! https://t.co/pAyrcCOPhI
First I love white men, not a man hater, but I am SICK &amp; TIRED of our country electing very old, rich (or pretend rich) white men they do not represent us! I have more pride in being an American than I ever have been in my life! https://t.co/b8Ds1i5FOq
This is absolutely horrible! If you have these thoughts please go to the nearest hospital &amp; get help! You are only destroying innocent people that have not caused your misery. We will all have our guns taken away because of you &amp; we cannot be protected from tyranny! https://t.co/YKV8Op0ZkR
@CNN I also wish to say to anyone out there that has these thoughts in your head to just go get help! Go to the nearest hospital &amp; check yourself in please! Nothing is accomplished by this except you will get guns banned then how will we fight against China "president for life" people
@CNN I am SO proud of MI no more imprisoning people for a plant, Gerrymandering or voter suppression! MI rocks!
Also I have never been so proud to have been born &amp; raised in MI with the voter turnout &amp; 94% in one vote spoke up against what is happening in this country. We voted in 4 proposals &amp; all passed! No more Gerrymandering or locking people up for a plant/weed!
I am so proud of this midterm election results! So many hurdles to overcome just to take back what we did &amp; if you look at the math, without the Gerrymandering, then #Resistance had a wonderful turnout! @BetoORourke did an excellent job for being in TX~! MI will take you! https://t.co/VGZRkbFGZC
From what I understand @realDonaldTrump does not have the authority to appoint an interim Attorney General without his confirmation? https://t.co/JwS471oHDK
Yes @CNN it is wrong as this is an artists renditioning of object &amp; it is following normal course of objects like asteroid or meteor. Thanks @neiltyson https://t.co/ROjfpORZS9
@CNN @CNNOpinion It is wrong, the picture shown is an artists renditioning not the actual picture, also the object is not "behaving" like an object that has power to move against the forces of the universe. It is following normal paths for asteroid or meteor.

Yes her testimony is consistent and in line with the memory of a traumatic event, if it was just a seamless story  without memory gaps I would think that she was adding fillers or just lying. I really  admire her admire her bravery and she is role model for all women! https://t.co/VFKEaFBRbJ

@JohnJHarwood @gailbriggs8 I don't understand your comment? Expenses are always accrued by attorney and a statement is sent to the client, but they are doing it pro bono for her which is wonderful!
This is exactly what I was thinking while listening to her heart-breaking testimony! WTF she's so brave to come forward with this with absolutely nothing to gain! A Dr. AND a professor at Stanford University is lying now? I admire her bravery she is a role model for us all! https://t.co/wVWEytFPES
@Kokomothegreat I feel exactly the same way! Scotland? This country is doomed if he gets in the Supreme Court meaning nobody cares about women, we're just all liars to them, we just love going through what she's going through right now it's so much fun! I really admire her bravery!
I agree 100%! https://t.co/LsnGrG7CsL
@TheRickyDavila Exactly!
Thank you Senator, I agree 100%! Many times I was brought to tears when I heard her and the other Senators statements. Which it is consistent with this type of experience, in traumatic experiences you remember forever certain aspects of it! https://t.co/zmazPrKfzO
@SenWarren Absolutely! Why would she ruin her life for this? She is Dr. Ford &amp; Professor Ford @ Stanford University for God's sake! Of course he is going to deny it they always do! WTF why now all women lie about rape and sexual assault, oh we love going through what she is today, it's fun!

@sailsior @peta So this sounds kind of bizarre, where are you getting this information from? I don't know anything about this but it sounds a little Breitbart News b******* I mean unless they're taking animals from abusive homes and then doing a mass Burial at the center I don't know?
@MicahEmerson86 @peta I never thought PETA promoted anti-meat diet for health reasons &amp; I can't believe anyone else did either so be real! +Fox News &amp; Science do not go together at all, hello climate change deniers! + real Scientific studies never said all meat = all bad!
@physaria @peta They used to be considered garbage meat but since we've allowed commercial fishing corporations to strip our oceans clean their status has been elevated to Gourmet. Why are we not talking about that? Stop massive ships striping our oceans!
@KevinBe3090 @peta What's with quotations &amp; crabs in the sea are not necessarily going to get eaten &amp; anybody in their right mind would say boiling a creature alive is cruel and unusual! People used to think that babies, human babies, didn't feel pain either!
We all do what little bit we can, throwing stones at everybody else who's actually doing something is working against each other, which is just what the big corporations want! https://t.co/neycNl4zcw
@_Magicdreamer Which is why it is best to keep our opinions out of it because we have to eat, so plants feel pain then there's basically no difference between crab/plant cow/tree etc. We can decide to treat food humanely &amp; not destroy every living thing on this planet saving us for last!

@SenWarren You must run for president in 2020 we need you!
@CtC271 @DaddyDaddymac Everything is great except Biden/Obama being put back in office we have term limits for a very good reason we don't want to end up like China with a president for life no matter how great they were as president besides @BarackObama is enjoying life now and @VP44 working on cancer

@kalaeveryday @DaddyDaddymac I am so sorry hope you feel better really soon!!!
Look at the way we treat so many animals for no reason! The thing that gets me is how horrible we treat our "food" the animals that give their lives so that over 7.6 billion of us do not go hungry! We need to START by mandating change NOT loosening regulations! https://t.co/IFZVFRyFTw

YES for these mega churches making huge profits enough to buy mansions, airplanes &amp; $5,000 suits then brag about it on their show! The poor people that send them $ are victims of con artists like so many others, we cannot blame them! https://t.co/lKyPxK03jO
@DaddyDaddymac Absolutely time to pay their share! If it is a small church or one that all revenues are spent to run the church &amp; charitable acts then like everyone else the expenses will offset the revenue so NO TAX! So this is ONLY about these huge mega churches with airplanes &amp; mansions!
Time for these churches making money hand over fist to pay their fair share! Tax them now no more free rides while buying mansions, airplanes &amp; $5,000 suits! https://t.co/abpKpkG2LW
@quaker_johan @DaddyDaddymac @Bluestate1984 Yes but too many churches are not true non-profits &amp; the ones that are would expense out all the revenue anyway and have 0 net income to report so therefore no taxes but the churches that have a lot of cash left at year end with no expense to cancel it out IS a for profit company
@micahbales @quaker_johan @DaddyDaddymac @Bluestate1984 Yes that is why I would add the caveat that the property must be worth over I don't know a million dollars? before property taxes would be owed.
@nkirk4homeless @BenDayle @PattyOLimerick @DaddyDaddymac Speaking as an accountant taxes paid would not give churches any special influence in the government, they will do everything they can to list expenses to reduce income therefore reduce taxes, like every other company does. We all pay &amp; do not acquire any special influence.
@CHURCHLADY320 @MamaBear64 @DaddyDaddymac @MemphisBelle111 I see this is very distressing for you but if you understood corporate tax structures it would alleviate your stress about this because every single example you cite is not how it would work, you do know about deducting expenses, right?
@CHURCHLADY320 @VeryBusyBrain @DaddyDaddymac @therealzanetta YES but ONLY if they show a profit or invest lavishly then try to deduct outlandish purchases. The corner church IS NOT THE ISSUE HERE! I am an accountant &amp; I am telling you that the tax laws for non-profits could be written so as JUST to affect like scientologists, big tv preach
@CHURCHLADY320 @JemmsCee2 @maly339417 @DaddyDaddymac @melinacorazon11 Yes it depends on the property so let's say any church worth more than a million dollars should pay property taxes!
@CHURCHLADY320 @maly339417 @DaddyDaddymac @melinacorazon11 This would, especially if done correctly, only really affect these super mega churches buying mansions &amp; airplanes while wearing a $5,000 suit conning $ from people that don't have to spare, we have to stop blaming the victims here, yes they gave the $ but they were also conned!
@CHURCHLADY320 @maly339417 @DaddyDaddymac @melinacorazon11 Small churches or poor churches wouldn't pay taxes just like poor people do not pay taxes. Churches would have to do what everyone else does every year &amp; file the correct forms to determine the tax amount if any to be paid so expenses are deducted therefore reduce the profit!
@maly339417 @CHURCHLADY320 @DaddyDaddymac @melinacorazon11 Well the church would file income tax papers like any other company and they would be able to deduct their expenses to reduce their gross income so maybe it would entice them to seek out those deductions and actually help people in the process!
@nnAnetsirK @DaddyDaddymac You have a great question here but as I think on it I pay taxes as an individual and yet I am separate from government and all the big corporations that pay (maybe) are also still separate so I think it would actually make them more separate as they are not treated special!
