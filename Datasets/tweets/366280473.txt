@ddale8 @AaronBlake Yes, obvious that it‚Äôs wrong. How do we know? Cognition.  How is it a cognitive problem? The brain engages in carrying out a wrong criminal action. That‚Äôs a problem.  What kind of problem is sending an explosive device through the mail?  A psychotic &amp; sociopathic problem.
@BillieJeanDavy @ddale8 @AaronBlake Good ways to put feelings.
@BillieJeanDavy @ddale8 @AaronBlake I tend to think of anger, hate, strategy, hurt - carried to an acted criminal extent - as impaired &amp; doing wrong. It‚Äôs goes off the norm (impaired, nuts, crazy, wth &amp; wtf) when it moves into a criminal act category, of ‚Äúgoing off‚Äù into wrong doing, fault, guilt.
@BillieJeanDavy @ddale8 @AaronBlake Yes agreed. I wasn‚Äôt using the words as legalese to buffer a criminal from crime, or brain from action, but rather in the common person‚Äôs sense of ‚Äúwow thats nuts to think it through and do such things.‚Äù
@ddale8 @AaronBlake That sort of activity via brain use is criminally and mentally wrong. Which is a problem. It‚Äôs not simple anymore.

@BigIndianGyasi I hadn‚Äôt lived within the lines. I understand. We have to eventually leave our childhood play behind.
@BigIndianGyasi True of my growing up, admiring Native people,  happily hearing hints of ‚Äúpossible‚Äù relatives, great grandparents. But along your point of family‚Äôs hold, when I grew up I realized I really wasn‚Äôt member of tribe - nobody knew me from a little maybe connection - who was I to them?
@brettachapman @BigIndianGyasi And Warren seems to be in common camp of white kids told they had some native roots and at least appreciated it enough to hold it in mind as positive, if not enough to be closer held in tribal family. Politics may distort even the humblest of admirations as suspicious promotions.
@brettachapman @BigIndianGyasi Has trump ever been a private citizen? Seems he‚Äôs been bursting his breeches public since his first inheritance allowed him PR.
@BigIndianGyasi We grow up as kids naive to the adult strictures and our curiosity reaches out beyond the lines - pretty much as innocent love. Then we get the slap backs - for many ‚Äúreasons.‚Äù We read or hear histories, tangled politics, and still hold wonder about many unknowns.

@BigIndianGyasi That‚Äôs right it‚Äôs about family.  A lot of us hear as children in our family that we have native relatives, so naturally being interested in native people, we look into it by reading, attending powwows, conversing, even buy a dna rest to see what‚Äôs what.  but still lots missing.

@ChuckGrassley Because you have a slant, a preordained result, that‚Äôs why your ‚Äúinvestigation‚Äù is suspect.
@ChuckGrassley As we‚Äôve seen historically, Senator, you and the other men on your side aren‚Äôt reliable as investigators. Your result will be partisan-based. We need non-partisan professionals (FBI) to followup their investigations since new info has emerged.
@ChuckGrassley Grassley - once he knew the victim came forward, should have immediately asked for a followup FBI investigation.  Had he done that immediately, the investigation probably would  have been completed by now, results shared with the committee &amp; ready for Monday hearing.
@SenatorCollins Sen. Grassley, once he knew the victim came forward, should have immediately asked for a followup FBI investigation. Had he done that immediately, the investigation probably would  have been completed by now, results shared with the committee &amp; ready for Monday hearing.

@SenatorCollins As new information has surfaced, it is imperative that the FBI followup their investigation. What they miss now will surely emerge later. It behooves members of Congress to go the full distance now and not be held to arbitrary deadlines. This may very well embarrass them later.
@EricHolder It certainly looks like the FBI has not completed their investigation - since new information has come to the surface. It would behoove all  elected officials to do all they can to investigate a potential lifetime appointee. Don‚Äôt want this to bulge up later.
