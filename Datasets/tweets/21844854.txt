When I interviewed Stone at the 2016 Republican Convention, he told me that even though he was no longer officially with the Trump campaign, he still talked to Trump “all the time.”

If Dems win House, they will likely subpoena Justice Kavanaugh and he will refuse it or reject their calls for recusal, Either way, it's a const crisis in Feb. of 2019. So issue boils to this: Vote yes and likely precipitate a const crisis. Vote no and unquestionably avoid one.
In fact the tattoo —his inability to be impartial—will be the subject of House Judiciary Comm hearings in Feb if he’s confirmed and Dems get control. He will fight calls for broad recusals and face impeachment for doing so. Const crisis easily avoided by defeating him. Do it. https://t.co/ek13eob0YZ

After all the noise about process, it’s a simple choice for Collins et al: If you believe Ford, you must vote no. If you think she’s making the whole thing up, you can in good conscience vote yes. If you’re not sure, the only principled view is to have the FBI gather more facts.
Feinstein should call a meeting with Collins, Murkowski and Flake and work out a Gang of 4 deal where the vote is postponed a week pending an FBI investigation. It would be good for the reputation of the Senate. Not holding my breath of course.

The overall impression of Judge Kavanaugh in these hearings is of a man whose indignation has become a belligerence that reflects poorly on his character.
How should a non-political, fair-minded person react, if they don’t know whom to believe? First, all questions about process—“sitting on accusations” etc.—are irrelevant even if true. The tie betw Ford and Kavanaugh must go to neither but to the Court, which means rejection.

This “due process” and “corroboration” arguments are such bs. If he really wanted due process and was open to corroboration, the accusers’s chief witness—Mark Judge—would be testifying.
This is who Brett Kavanaugh is and always has been—from Ken Starr to the Florida recount to the Bush White House and the bench—a partisan hack who has no place in the Supreme Court.

Sorrow for what happened to Ford, sorrow for Kavanaugh not withdrawing himself, sorrow for bad Repub questions. If BK is angrily prosecuted as if in court, backlash could save him. This is not a trial—of her or him. It’s a final job interview. https://t.co/EAJ58RCJAC
Agree on overuse of “optics,” @OuterCrone but you surely know what I mean. To stop Kavanaugh, which is what this about (Ford’s story disqualifies him), Democrats need to be smart and avoid grandstanding. https://t.co/pD05Z1uIoi
Republicans are likely to look terrible in a hearing with Ford and BK. But there is peril for Democrats, too. To improve optics and increase their odds of stopping him, they need to question BK more in sorrow than in anger, even though they have reason to be angry.
A woman I know asks: Do all the people echoing Trump and saying Ford should have reported the incident at the time believe the same about the thousands of adolescents molested by priests? If they do—if they think those kids should have turned their priests in—they should say so.

I’ll discuss similarities and differences betw Ford vs Kavanaugh and Anita Hill vs Clarence Thomas on MSNBC in a few. The big difference is that the charge now is sexual assault, not sexual harassment. The other difference—this was high school—means less amid BK’s total denial.
That’s probably what Christine Ford meant when she said she thought he might “inadvertently kill me.” https://t.co/SEXlYQtqGX
Republicans who want to defend BK are in a box: Do they use the "he was only a kid" defense or the "she's lying" defense? It's one or the other. Problem is, BK already chose the latter, claiming he never knew her. So the "high school" defense is now irrelevant. https://t.co/FAI4ohMj2W

You don’t birch-slap your friends and cozy up to your enemies. NATO is the most successful treaty in world history. It has prevented a world war for 70 years. The Senate should censure Trump for shaming and weakening the nation.
Kavanaugh should be asked if he believes all 9 justices were wrong in 1997 when they ruled that the Paula Jones civil suit could move forward, complete with testimony by Clinton. And if he says yes, then ask why he shouldn’t also say if the Court was wrong in Roe v. Wade.

Discrimination based on one's political views--even if they are rancid--is bad for society. As a Jewish kid in Chicago, I saw Nazis marching in Skokie, where many Holocaust survivors lived. It was very upsetting but the courts were right to let them march. @FourDarkYears https://t.co/7yVgOd3SQM
I favor smart Gandhi-style and MLK-style civil disobedience. But it always worked best when it was tactically clever. Hard to know, but neither would have likely favored this denial of service since it mirrors discrimination against them. Shaming by other patrons? Maybe. https://t.co/7OC1qSdfpq
No, @ProgressNow00 , stopping fascism requires a strong and fearless resistance that is also tactically smart. Trump must be attacked ceaselessly but in ways that enhance efforts to win the House so he can be checked. SHS shaming doesn't do that. https://t.co/oMv5dAAcCD

Barring Trumpists from public establishments is no different than not making a cake for gays and lesbians. And it's a form of hypocrisy by progressives that distracts attention from Trump's abuses. Legitimate outrage can be shown in other ways. @jmeacham https://t.co/MejfTVNOXA

In commentary, I will no longer refer to them as “detention centers”. In the spirit of “Hoovervilles”—a brilliant coinage by a DNC official in 1931—they should be called “Trump Hotels”—which will drive Trump nuts. If that’s too subtle, “baby jails” and “kid cages” will do.

Question for the great @Fahrenthold : Could that be because they no longer use shadow banking networks like those run by Russian oligarchs?
