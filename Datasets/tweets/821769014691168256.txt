Quite literally, #IranDeal is based on verification, not trust: 159 toughly negotiated pages of detailed constraints put a straitjacket on Iran’s nuclear activities that effectively block its path to a nuclear bomb.
The real heart of the #IranDeal is unprecedented, international verification provisions.
#IranDeal opponents underplay or ignore the importance of the commitments that don’t expire:	✅ Permanent prohibition on a nuclear weapons program	✅ Permanent adherence to extra verification measures in Additional Protocol	✅ Req’t to ship out all spent fuel of Arak reactor

In other news, I think I’m getting the hang of this "thread" thing.
@SecretaryPerry @HoustonChron 8/8  We should be modernizing the SPR, not selling it off. Congress knows it. And @SecretaryPerry should, too.
@SecretaryPerry @HoustonChron 7/8  Side effect of this modernization: thousands of jobs. Cutting modernization funds &amp; shutting down 2 SPR sites reduces those jobs.
@SecretaryPerry @HoustonChron 6/8  In 2015, Congress authorized $2 billion to expand &amp; modernize the SPR’s distribution system and build new terminals.
@SecretaryPerry @HoustonChron 5/8  Rapidly putting large volumes of oil from the SPR into global markets mitigates harmful impacts of price spikes on the global economy.
@SecretaryPerry @HoustonChron 4/8  In an emergency, SPR is obligated to meet more than 40% of the total global release of strategic stocks. Key in international response.
@SecretaryPerry @HoustonChron 3/8  The 1975 law to est. SPR aimed to prevent significant harm to US economy from future physical supply disruptions like those in mid-70s.
@SecretaryPerry @HoustonChron 2/8  The US oil industry rightly cares about profits, not maintaining surplus capacity for emergency disruptions. The latter is govt’s role.

@ENERGY 4/6 These “advanced persistent threats” have long worried US intelligence officials – and recent events prove they are very real.
