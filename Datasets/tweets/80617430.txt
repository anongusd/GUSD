It is interesting that Cohen says Stormy Daniels “demanded” the $130k. He is not treating her purely as a victim, as she is often portrayed, but as someone who was actively trying to get a huge payout from Trump.
But there‘s another section of the Cohen sentencing memo where it does say that *both* the campaign finance violations and false statements to Congress were “in accordance with Client-1’s directives.” https://t.co/uTLDEg5JfX

@maustermuhle @ideasimprove I agree the headline and that one sentence you cited could confuse some readers, but I believe a fair reading of the piece makes it clear it’s only about “official” DC. Thank you for reading it and engaging in a respectful conversation/debate about it, which is so rare on here.
@maustermuhle @ideasimprove But the social networks of the powerful, whatever their size, are important to cover. The fact that there are lots of *other* social networks is irrelevant. It’s like complaining that a White House reporter is ignoring coverage of all the other thousands of houses in the DC area.
@willfnye @AOC It might be true (and perhaps good policy) that Dems are no longer willing to support expanding nuclear under any circumstances, but in 2010 negotiations a lot of environmentalists who spent their lives fighting against nuclear were willing to expand it as part of a climate deal.
That’s what happened during the cap and trade debate in 2009-2010.
One major critique of Green New Deal from @aoc is no expansion of nuclear power. It’d be boneheaded to include nuclear in the first iteration of any climate change policy proposal because Dems would want to save nuclear as something to potentially trade in a negotiation.
@maustermuhle @ideasimprove read the next two sentences
@ideasimprove @maustermuhle As Derek notes it’s very obviously about official/federal/political DC, though maybe the headline, which I obviously didn’t write, confused some readers? Anyone who actually reads the entire piece—rare these days, I realize—will come to the same conclusion as Derek.

@NateSilver538 @joshtpm 2=Obama’s pot-smoking Hawaii and California years and parts of his monastic Columbia U and early south side Chicago years. 3=Dreams From My Father.
@NateSilver538 @joshtpm I think Obama qualifies. The big difference is that Obama worked to shed that image and Beto still embraces it.
This is gonna be like left shark, isn’t it?
Oprah says that she asked all of her guests today what they wanted to get out of the conversation and that Beto told her, “I just want to be fully myself.”
Fwiw Bradley Cooper says he hopes Beto runs for president
*increasingly
One note on Beto’s timeline for a decision. According to Beto camp, In early March a major profile of Beto is scheduled in Vanity Fair, which is timed to coincide with a major documentary about Beto. March will be Beto month.
One interesting note about this event. Beto is fourth Oprah interview today, after Michael B. Jordan, Melinda Gates, and Lisa Borders. The audience has seemed most engaged and enthusiastic about the Beto conversation. (Though Bradley Cooper is up next, so he could beat them all.)
Beto confirms he &amp; Obama discussed Beto running. Says Obama didn’t encourage him to run but helped him think about process and what it does to family. Beto mentions how star struck he was to be in Obama’s office taking to him and how it’s similar to how he feels talking to Oprah.
Beto says he told Obama there were many times during Texas campaign when he just wanted to give up and go home. He asked Obama if he ever felt that way and Obama said “every day.”
Beto now discussing his recent meeting with Obama. Says he and Obama barely knew each other while Beto served in Congress.
Beto: “I’m increasing excited about doing something”
Beto now turning the tables and asking Oprah about her thought process on running for president.
Beto gives a deadline of end of this month to make a decision.
Oprah asks what’s the reason he would run. Beto says needs to know: “Can I be part of bringing people together in a deeply divided America...” Then lays out some big issues like climate change and political reform. Says if he can “play some role” solving those issues, he’ll do it
Still non committal. Says it will be a family decision that hasn’t been made yet.
Beto: “I have been thinking about running for president.” Oprah’s pressing him hard now
Watching @Oprah interview @BetoORourke. He certainly does not sound like someone who’s not running. https://t.co/fSgA4mkRpq

That might help explain the aggressive prosecution of payments to women as a campaign finance violation. Plenty of smart lawyers think that case is a stretch, but you might throw it in if you think there’s a broad pattern of activities meant to subvert the democratic process.
One possibility based on emerging picture of what Mueller has is that his final report is not so much about discrete offenses like obstruction or collusion but a broader argument that Trump cheated to win the election, which is the heart of what impeachment was meant to remedy

That doesn’t mean prosecutors are above reproach. They have enormous power &amp; should be covered skeptically. (I think novel campaign finance charge against Cohen deserves scrutiny.) But Trump interview shows contempt for law &amp; desire to use DOJ strictly as political weapon/shield.

Everyone is numb and in shock. We can’t believe what we just witnessed, but for me it’s this simple: The President of the United States openly colluded with Putin to undermine our democracy.
Trump’s post-meeting statement was even worse than most imagined it would be. He stood next to Putin and attacked the American media and the Democratic Party but refused to confront Putin for attacking our democracy. Disgraceful.
But perhaps the most revealing quote in the piece is from Lynn Jenkins, a House Republican from Kansas, who compared Trump to “the worst human being on the face of the earth,” and then explained the secret reason why Republicans love him anyway. https://t.co/0adNKrql2K
GOP Rep. Mark Sanford told me he believes Trump’s rise is a “clear and present danger,” so I asked him if he supports a Democratic takeover of Congress to serve as a check on Trump. His response may surprise you! https://t.co/0adNKrql2K
I also asked Lindsey Graham if he believed that Trump was the leader of the free world.		He paused for several seconds and then didn’t answer the question. 		https://t.co/0adNKrql2K
That quote ended up on the cutting room floor but the full piece, with more from Graham and many other Republicans, is here: https://t.co/0adNKrql2K

6. So knowing Rice made unmasking requests says nothing except that normal process was followed. We have evidence of requests but not abuse.
5. And is the masked person's identity necessary to understand the report?
4. The NSA has a 2-part test to determine if they will unmask someone's identity for a policy maker: is there a valid need to know?
3. If a policy maker wants to know identity of masked people to better understand an intelligence report she can make formal request to NSA.
2. If NSA believes the intercept has intelligence value the report is distributed w/identities of US person masked.
1. For NSA to report something with a mention of a US person it needs to have "intelligence value." Otherwise the intercept is purged.

At time of pivotal Comey letter on Clinton email, FBI had been investigating Trump campaign links to Russia for three months.
Comey: Investigation began in late July
Summary of earth-shattering Comey testimony:	1. FBI investigating Russia/Trump campaign collusion 	2. No evidence of Trump wiretapping claim
Comey reiterates: "we don't have any information that supports those tweets."
Comey: "no president could" order a wire tap
Comey on Trump wiretapping claim: "I have no information that supports those tweets."
I bet John Podesta wishes all these GOP privacy advocates were a little louder last year.
This line of questioning seems meant to show that unmasking of Flynn, who was picked up talking to Russian amb., was possibly inappropriate.
Now that this investigation has been publicly confirmed by the FBI director expect louder calls for an independent counsel to take it over.
Nunes so far only zeroing in on leaks rather than substance of investigation.
Comey confirms FBI investigation of links between Trump campaign and Russia.

.@NormEisen on Trump's plan to deal with conflicts of interest: https://t.co/0DoCT1GHCa
Psst, the reset button wasn't supposed to be real
Trump has literally melded his personal businesses with the US government and has announced a pathway for foreigners to submit bribes
He just created a clear mechanism for foreign entities to curry favor with him
Good lord, this argument about the Emoluments Clause has been demolished by numerous legal scholars
This is an ethical nightmare that puts Trump and his children's financial interests above those of the public interest.
Orwellian doublespeak to describe divestment as creating more conflicts than this plan
This reminds me of the Christie press conference when he hired his own lawyers to clear him of wrongdoing in Bridgegate
It is patently false that the President is not covered by ethics laws. Here's a list https://t.co/ZbtdhSy4Iv
So he is not divesting
This is disastrous if, as it seems, that he's only turning over management--not ownership--to kids.

Wow, Trump now has more disdain for the IC than for the news media
