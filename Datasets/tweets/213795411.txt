2018-19 will open with the second-largest opening balance since 2000.
We are leaving Wisconsin in the best financial condition in a generation. This is part of our legacy and it will continue to drive Wisconsin forward.
$588.5 million surplus! For the 8th year in a row, Wisconsin has ended the fiscal year with a surplus! https://t.co/9jIyyguZI5
Wisconsin‚Äôs unemployment rate has been at or below 3% for 10 straight months! We also added nearly 10,000 Private-Sector Jobs in November, bringing the total jobs created since we‚Äôve taken office to over 250,000.
Great news! -&gt; ‚ÄúWisconsin‚Äôs tax burden‚Äîdefined as state and local taxes as a share of income‚Äîfell in 2018 to its lowest level in nearly 50 years.‚Äù https://t.co/Xsbvd3ZZ8Q
Unlike the bills I signed today, this one did fundamentally shift power from one branch to another when things had grown out of balance: https://t.co/uKFP3KYhIS
These bills increase transparency, accountability, stability, and protect the taxpayers of Wisconsin. https://t.co/tZIkwaSUoL
The new law requires a uniform number of days for early voting all across the state. Previously, some communities had more days to vote early than other communities - which was not fair.
The new law requires notice and a report when the governor pardons a convicted felon.
The new law ensures that lawmakers have a say in how things like multi-million legal settlements are spent once they are deposited in the state treasury.
We also want to be able to implement the waiver the state received for our bi-partisan Healthcare Stability Plan that will lower premiums in January. The new law does that too.
The new law does the same for the welfare reform waiver we already received and the administrative practices we used for helping people transition from welfare to the workforce - as well as work search requirements for unemployment benefits.
Over the past eight years, we worked to involve members of the state Legislature when we sought federal waivers. We wanted to be certain that lawmakers would be supportive if we received a waiver. Senate Bill 886 codifies that practice into law.
Signed Senate Bills 883, 884, &amp; 886 into law in Green Bay. Despite all the hype and hysteria out there, these bills do nothing to fundamentally diminish executive authority. The bottom line is the new gov. will cont. to be one of the most powerful chief executives in the country. https://t.co/lBvfJt1ZzX

Bruesewitz was born on January 15, 1915 in Almena (Barron County). He was living in Appleton with his sister when he decided to enlist in 1940. 		God rest his soul on this Pearl Harbor Remembrance Day.
On March 28, 2018, the Defense POW/MIA Accounting Agency identified his remains. He was initially buried as an unknown at the National Memorial Cemetery of the Pacific.
Buresewitz was one of the 429 members of the crew of the USS Oklahoma that died on December 7, 1941 when the ship was struck, capsized and sank.
Today, 77 years after he died, Navy Seaman First Class William Gustave Bruesewitz is being buried with full military honors at Arlington National Cemetery. https://t.co/JHpBwUMyOr

Losing hundreds of really good paying jobs at Kimberly Clark would create a real problem in the Fox Cities. Solving it requires leadership from both parties.
Reality Check: The really good paying jobs at Kimberly Clark are not at a paper mill. They make consumer goods like Depends that are a growing part of the market. Without a change, they are going to Arkansas.
There is no long-term solution other than the bill that will save these jobs. Leadership requires action and failure to act will lead to losing hundreds of really good paying jobs at Kimberly Clark.

Now, 13,000 manufacturing jobs are returning &amp; the city will still use less water than in 1995. https://t.co/tVcSkMB28W
Racine's proposed 7 million gallons per day (MPD) water withdrawal represents only 0.07% of the total daily withdrawal from Lake Michigan by all states, which totals 9.6 billion gallons per day (BGD). And it is far less than what was used 20 years ago. #AccountableGov https://t.co/fDcI5qRCCW

Bringing 13,000 good-paying, family-supporting jobs to Wisconsin is the right thing to do - regardless of politics. I believe we should think more about the next generation - who will benefit from these high tech jobs.

A critical part of the future of WI manufacturing, is equipping the next generation with the training and skills necessary to find a good paying job. That‚Äôs why we‚Äôre investing like never before into youth apprenticeships, which have doubled over the past 8 years.

The last two parts of the law came from legislation I wrote after a shooting at Wauwatosa West High School in 1993.
And it applies to those who were involuntarily committed and have an order not to possess a firearm.

We put new funding in the state budget for mental health services in our schools after hearing about concerns from superintendents, principals and teachers at listening sessions across the state.
In Wisconsin, we have already provided over $8 billion in tax relief since 2011, from across the board reductions, to helping manufacturers and farmers, to historic property tax reductions ‚Ä¶ delivering targeted relief to working families with our surplus makes sense.
And, in 2017, Republicans expanded the credit to $2,000 per child.
In 2012, the credit of $1,000 was made permanent.
In 2003, President Bush accelerated the increase to $1,000 per child.
In 2001, President Bush offered rebates of $500 for single parents and $600 for married couples. It also sought to increase the credit to $1,000 by 2010.
In 1997, Congress enacted a $500 child tax credit.
In 1986, President Reagan expanded the standard deduction and personal exemption for dependent children.
The best way to target middle-class tax relief for parents is a child tax credit. That is why every major tax cut at the federal level in the past few decades has provided families targeted relief.

Another homegrown business is expanding in Wisconsin! @MilwaukeeTool will create 350 jobs with an average annual salary of $75,000. This is good news for WI workers, families, and the state‚Äôs economy! #WIWorking https://t.co/MkfVmbydWU
Eight years ago, things were not very good in our state. There were double-digit tax increases, billion-dollar budget deficits, &amp; record job losses. We don‚Äôt want to go back to those days. That would be a giant step backwards. #WISOTS #WIWorking https://t.co/9o3KlVkFAE
#FlashbackFriday: A look back to when @FLTonetteWalker spoke during the 2017 State of the State. Happy #NationalSpousesDay to my lovely wife. https://t.co/hBfnyClgj8
Surplus money belongs to the people, not the government. That‚Äôs why we‚Äôve provided $8 billion in tax cuts over eight years &amp; why we propose a new child tax credit rebate for WI families. It‚Äôs one more way we‚Äôre creating a more #AccountableGov. #WISOTS https://t.co/dGPF7naqRr
Eight years ago, the previous governor &amp; legislature created a $3.6 billion budget deficit &amp; raided the transportation fund. Today, we enjoy a $579 million surplus (FY17), our pension is fully-funded &amp; the rainy-day fund is 168x bigger than when we took office. #WISOTS #WIWorking https://t.co/r375Gwm0Ns
Thanks to the amazingly large number of state Representatives and Senators who showed up at our stops today to support our Ambitious Agenda for 2018!
Stopped in Janesville to discuss how we are investing in #StudentSuccess. Eight years ago, funding was cut for schools &amp; local governments. Today, we made the largest investment in K-12 history &amp; our Act 10 reforms have saved schools, local &amp; state governments $BILLIONS. #WISOTS https://t.co/Blh5yIjbQx
We are getting positive things done for the people of Wisconsin! Employment is at historic highs and unemployment at historic lows. We received 3 bond rating upgrades in 3 months. And we announced the largest economic development project in state history. #WISOTS #WIWorking https://t.co/fW9o9EyfkO
Great visit in Chippewa Valley! The $100/child tax credit rebate could be used to pay for a new backpack, winter coat, activity fees at school, or co-pay at the doctor or dentist. We are working to pass this plan by the time Wisconsin‚Äôs kids go back to school in the fall. #WISOTS https://t.co/K9YHl2XpNL
We‚Äôre calling on the legislature to use part of our state budget surplus to provide parents, like these in Rhinelander, with a child tax credit rebate in time for the next school year. I recall how expensive it was to buy new school supplies for Matt &amp; Alex. Every dollar helps. https://t.co/BnQjvDqi0A
Visited Oshkosh to discuss our Ambitious Agenda, which includes a $100 per child tax credit, more resources for our schools, bringing stability to health care, developing Wisconsin‚Äôs workforce, welfare reform, and more. We are moving WI forward! #WISOTS #WIWorking https://t.co/Lnf8CPnPBm
Another business chooses Wisconsin! Diversified Manufacturing Corp. (DMC) is expected to create ~150 jobs at its new facility in Pierce County, which opens today. The company relocated to WI from MN. #WIWorking https://t.co/NfufdwsmeV
Special thanks to U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman @ChuckGrassley for his leadership &amp; commitment to allow judicial nominees the opportunity to be heard. Mike Brennan is an exceptional nominee who will serve the Seventh Circuit‚Äôs WI seat well. https://t.co/BboJrsA8uP https://t.co/YYL2bWPgaa
Visited with both GOP caucuses earlier in the week and support for our Ambitious Agenda for 2018 - including our child tax credit - is strong.
Our Ambitious Agenda includes increasing sparsity aid, creating a WI Career Creator program, expanding welfare reform, passing our Small Biz Plan, developing a more #AccountableGov, funding a new child tax credit rebate, &amp; implementing our Health Care Stability Plan. #WISOTS https://t.co/VgqhBwogfB
Great visit in La Crosse! Eight years ago, things were not very good in our state. Thankfully, many of us had the courage to make some tough decisions. As a result, we‚Äôve turned our state around. Wisconsin‚Äôs future looks bright for students, businesses, &amp; families! #WISOTS https://t.co/JgQPCAJ2VC
Always enjoy joining family and friends to welcome back our troops. A warm welcome home to Wisconsin‚Äôs 1-147th Aviation Troop! https://t.co/m62SJND2Ir
Stopped in Wausau to discuss how our reforms are working &amp; the economy is growing. Eight years ago, the state government created a $3.6 BILLION budget DEFICIT! Today, WI has a sizable $579 MILLION surplus &amp; we‚Äôre returning it back to you, the taxpayers! #WISOTS #WIWorking https://t.co/C7stvhncAQ
Families in Green Bay and across the state will receive $100 for every child, under 18, living at home. I ask the legislature to pass the Child Tax Credit Rebate, so that by the time students go back to school, parents will have a check in the mailbox. #WISOTS https://t.co/jCkVVJnwVp
The state of our state is historically strong. Wisconsin‚Äôs future is bright. But we aren‚Äôt done yet. We continue working and winning for Wisconsin! #WISOTS #WIWorking https://t.co/UL2PtUVBfu
We are giving $$$ back to hardworking taxpayers because when we have a surplus that $$ should go back to you. We‚Äôve eliminated the state property tax, lowered income taxes, &amp; created a Child Tax Credit Rebate. This is your reform dividend. You deserve it. #WISOTS #AccountableGov https://t.co/cvMnlYyDNo
"Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker calls for $122 million child tax credit in 'State of the State' speech" - @journalsentinel https://t.co/Y7Jb7f7N3D
The state of our state is historically strong. Wisconsin‚Äôs future is bright. But we‚Äôre not done yet. Together, our Ambitious Agenda will move Wisconsin FORWARD. #WIWorking #WISOTS https://t.co/SGtsiZbT20
Today, I ask members of the Legislature to pass my plan, so that by the time these kids, and all the others like them across the state begin school this fall, their parents will have a check in the mailbox. #WIWorking https://t.co/XthINmVlxB https://t.co/0EsZLakbiO
Today, I want you to know that I am proud to be your Governor. I‚Äôm proud of the work we‚Äôve done here. Let‚Äôs keep working together. Let‚Äôs keep moving Wisconsin forward. #WISOTS #WIWorking
More than 90% of the laws I‚Äôve signed as Governor had more than just votes from Republican lawmakers. So today, I ask members of the Legislature to work together &amp; move on these important items. They're not Republican or Democrat issues. They're Wisconsin issues. #WISOTS
Rich or poor, big city or small town, Republican or Democrat. People want us to work together to empower students; create new career opportunities &amp; strengthen our workforce; help WI's small businesses grow; provide stability in health care; and make WI proud #WISOTS
Since coming into office, I've signed 28 pieces of legislation into law to combat and treat Wisconsin's opioid and illegal drug addiction crisis. Today, I ask the legislature to pass the latest recommendations from the Task Force on Opioid Abuse. #WISOTS #HopeActLiveWI
Instead of seeking to put thousands more people onto government assistance through the Obamacare expansion, our plan helps drive down premiums to make health insurance plans more affordable and will likely lead to more choices for consumers. #WISOTS #AccountableGov https://t.co/E1FJv0lvTw
Step 7: We propose our Health Care Stability Plan to guarantee coverage of pre-existing conditions, make SeniorCare a permanent state program, &amp; provide assistance to keep premiums more affordable in the individual market. Where Washington failed, WI will lead. #WISOTS https://t.co/KyBYQMUw2y
Step 6: We also have exciting news for WI families: a child tax credit funded by our $579 million Reform Dividend. Families across the state would receive $100 for every child living at home under 18. We're returning this Reform Dividend to you, the people of WI. #WISOTS https://t.co/qqTYYRiiYQ
Step 5: We are working to create more effective, efficient &amp; #AccountableGov for the people of WI. That's why we created a plan to reform WI‚Äôs approach to corrections &amp; treatment for juvenile offenders. We now call on the Legislature to pass that plan. #WISOTS
In addition to our budget's $41.5 million total broadband investment, I‚Äôm calling on the @FCC to finalize rules increasing access to broadband internet by advancing television white space technology. This is one more way to expand broadband access to rural areas.  #WISOTS
We recognize that farmers are facing challenges with low commodity prices. That‚Äôs why, earlier today, I signed Executive Order #275 that expands resources for farmers to reach new markets across the country and around the world. #WISOTS https://t.co/sMWiVf1aoO
To ensure more small businesses succeed in rural parts of WI, I propose Rural Econ Development &amp; Family Farm Funds to provide long-term investment in econ &amp; workforce development; increase soil &amp; water protection/conservation; &amp; help dairy farmers increase profitability. #WISOTS
Step 4: I ask the members of the Legislature to pass our Small Business Plan to help even more employers grow across the state. Our plan reduces businesses costs, prepares the workforce, removes barriers to work, and helps attract new talent. #WISOTS #WIWorking https://t.co/y1KEYMCYME
Some complain our reforms will make it harder to get government assistance. The truth is, our reforms are working to make it easier to get a job. Like @TommyForHealth in the '90s ‚Äì when unemployment was last this low ‚Äì we are moving people from welfare to the workforce. #WISOTS
Step 3: With more people working than ever before, we cannot afford to have anyone on the sidelines. We propose expanding our Wisconsin Works for Everyone welfare reforms. Public assistance should be a trampoline, not a hammock. #WISOTS #RewardingWork https://t.co/H3EBHjeAPS
Step 2: We developed a new WI Career Creator program with @WITechSystem, @UWSystem &amp; @PrivateCollege to train students for exciting in-demand jobs &amp; developments. Years ago, brain drain was a problem. Now, all WI's exciting new opportunities are fostering a brain gain. #WISOTS
Step 1: To ensure that every child has access to a great education, we have a plan to increase Sparsity Aid &amp; help low revenue school districts to put more resources into the classroom. This is on top of our historic K-12 investments in education. #WISOTS #StudentSuccess https://t.co/T8r5Enb4rW
Our new Ambitious Agenda will keep us moving in the right direction. #WISOTS
Thankfully, many of us here today had the courage to make some tough decisions that helped turn WI around. Those results now allow us to invest record amounts into our priorities while still making WI more affordable. We will keep moving Wisconsin forward #WISOTS #WIWorking
2018 Wisconsin State of the State Address #WISOTS https://t.co/XfFiC2NP2n
Eight years ago, things were not very good in our state. There were double-digit tax increases, billion-dollar budget deficits, &amp; massive job losses. We don‚Äôt want to go back to those days. That would be a giant step backwards. #WISOTS
Foxconn will be #MadeinWI! Once fully operational, the company will spend ~$1.4 billion a year with WI businesses, employ 13,000 in WI, &amp; have a $7 billion annual economic impact. Families, workers, &amp; companies across the state will benefit. #WISOTS https://t.co/93EnF5goUG
Eight years ago, according to @ChiefExecGrp, Wisconsin ranked 41st for business and was consistently in the bottom ten places to do business. Today, for the first time in the history of the survey, Wisconsin ranks in the top ten states for business. #WISOTS #WIWorking https://t.co/oflYby0xQ1
The overall state and local tax burden in Wisconsin, once one of the highest in the country, is now below the national average. Based on data from the @USCensusBureau, it‚Äôs the lowest it‚Äôs been in more than 50 years. #WISOTS #WIWorking
Eight years ago, taxes were going up, with property taxes alone rising 27% the decade before we took office. Today, both property &amp; income taxes are actually lower than they were in 2010. And, for the first time since 1931, there is no state property tax. #WISOTS #WIWorking https://t.co/cO8nyoEDPE
Eight years ago, WI did not have any state-funded grant programs for broadband infrastructure expansion. Today, we do, and our budget invests $41.5 million to provide high speed internet to WI communities &amp; the latest technology and training to schools. #WISOTS #AccountableGov https://t.co/oW7XeRBAly
Project SEARCH helps high school students with disabilities prepare to enter the workforce. We've expanded the program from 1 site eight years ago, to 27 sites by fall '18. Today, we rank in the top ten states for hiring people with disabilities (@UNHIOD). #WISOTS #RewardingWork https://t.co/Ht8eZg8qdA
Eight years ago, there were ~4,000 people with disabilities on waiting lists for long-term care services. This year we will eliminate wait lists for children who need long-term care services &amp; expand Family Care &amp; IRIS to every part of the state. #WISOTS #AccountableGov
Eight years ago, there were people living in poverty who were on a waiting list for access to health coverage under BadgerCare. Today, for the first time in the history of the state, everyone living in poverty is covered under BadgerCare. #WISOTS #AccountableGov
The number of youth apprenticeship students has more than doubled from 8 years ago - as has financial support from the state. And state funding for high tech Fab Labs doubled in this budget. We are giving our students a head start on outstanding careers. #WISOTS #StudentSuccess https://t.co/KNBb57bUe9
Eight years ago, the previous governor &amp; legislature actually cut funding for schools &amp; local governments. Today, we made the largest investment in K-12 education history &amp; our Act 10 reforms have saved schools, local &amp; state governments $BILLIONS. #WISOTS #StudentSuccess
We invested more than $6 billion into the transportation system in our recent state budget - which brings our total investment to $24 billion over 8 years. That‚Äôs $3 billion more than what former Governor Doyle spent on transportation over the same time period. #WISOTS https://t.co/6lvBOaRVbA
Eight years ago, the previous governor &amp; legislature created a $3.6 billion budget deficit &amp; raided the transportation fund. Today, we enjoy a $579 million surplus (FY17), our pension is fully-funded &amp; the rainy day fund is 168x bigger than when we took office. #WISOTS #WIWorking https://t.co/cCU2qas9a7
Eight years ago, in Jan 2010, the unemployment rate was 9.2%. Today, the unemployment rate is down to 3.0%. That is tied for the lowest unemployment rate in the history of Wisconsin! In fact, more people are working in Wisconsin than ever before. #WISOTS #WIWorking https://t.co/4caF8dtNnf
No other state provides more benefits for veterans than Wisconsin. We offer 23 benefits for our veterans while the next closest state offers 21. Our vets can receive free tuition we expanded eligibility so more of our veterans‚Äô spouses &amp; families can, too. #WISOTS #WIWorking https://t.co/Ve8vWxH8LA
We are getting positive things done for the people of Wisconsin. Our health care systems rank #1 in the nation for quality &amp; we are one of the best states for access to health coverage. #WISOTS #WIWorking https://t.co/ux0otPr6Sn
To make college more affordable for students &amp; working families, we froze @UWSystem tuition for all WI undergrads 6 years in a row. And financial assistance for students in need is at an all-time high, making higher ed possible for thousands of WI students #WISOTS #StudentSuccess https://t.co/bcpsIIMhAI
We invested more actual dollars into K-12 education than ever before ‚Äì an extra $200 for every student in every school in every part of the state this year &amp; another $204 increase for every student on top of that next year. #WISOTS #StudentSuccess https://t.co/LzTZqYx5AF
Today, I am proud to declare that the state of our state is historically strong! Employment is at historic highs and unemployment at historic lows. We received 3 bond rating upgrades in 3 months. And we announced the largest economic development project in state history. #WISOTS https://t.co/yzhzVKsLAN
https://t.co/oKkgxL2fbK
Last year, @FLTonetteWalker discussed her groundbreaking work with Fostering Futures at #WISOTS. Since then, she‚Äôs worked closely w/ representatives and senators at the state &amp; federal levels to implement trauma-informed care at the state &amp; national level.
https://t.co/A9ymdOpSyX
Stopped by @theRealWRA Advocacy Day to highlight our Small Biz Agenda. We are working to reduce business costs, prepare the workforce, remove barriers to work, &amp; attract new talent. We are working for WI‚Äôs small businesses! #WISOTS https://t.co/zFMz1Whkn8
Excited to announce our new Rural Agenda, which creates Rural Econ Development &amp; Family Farm Funds to provide long-term investment in econ &amp; workforce development; increase soil &amp; water protection &amp; conservation; &amp; help dairy farmers increase profitability https://t.co/fYBjkkT2Z2
I am proud that we are getting positive things done for the people of Wisconsin. But we‚Äôre not done yet. So, let‚Äôs get going. Let‚Äôs keep working together. Let‚Äôs keep moving Wisconsin forward. #WISOTS
...that the state provide assistance to keep those premiums from making health care coverage unreachable for many of our fellow citizens.  #WISOTS (2/2)
For the small number of people who seek coverage through the individual market, and not through their employer or through Medicaid or Medicare, I propose ‚Ä¶ #WISOTS (1/2)
Since it was first approved in 2002, the state has asked for an extension of SeniorCare four times. It is time to make this a permanent and stable program. #WISOTS
With that in mind, I propose that we enact a law in Wisconsin that will guarantee coverage of pre-existing conditions. That way someone who has cancer or another serious disease or ailment will not have to worry about obtaining or keeping coverage. #WISOTS (2/2)
The biggest concern I hear about is from those who are worried about pre-existing conditions. #WISOTS (1/2)
Our citizens are crying out for a stable health care system. Washington has failed to act, so it is time for us to lead in Wisconsin. That is why, today, I propose the Health Care Stability Plan. #WISOTS
With more people working than ever before, we cannot afford to have anyone on the sidelines. #WISOTS
Since we started requiring employment and worker training, more than 25,000 people have gained employment [through our FSET program]. #WISOTS
And we want to ensure that everyone getting public assistance can pass a drug test. If someone fails, we set aside resources to get them into rehabilitation because we understand that if we get them healthy, we can find a job for anyone in the state. #WISOTS (2/2)
We want able-bodied, working age adults to work at least 30 hours a week or enroll in job training to get assistance. We want to expand welfare reform statewide. #WISOTS (1/2)
I want to ensure educational excellence everywhere. With that in mind, we have a plan that will increase Sparsity Aid and help out low revenue school districts. #WISOTS (2/2)
Looking ahead, we need to continue to help rural schools keep more money in the classroom. Many of these schools have unique needs related to transportation and to the size of the district. #WISOTS (1/2)
A good school equals a great life, and we have some of the best schools in the country. We will build off of our historic investments into K-12 education. #WISOTS
Plus, we gave schools extra resources to cover transportation costs, to add mental health services, and to put new technology in the classroom. #WISOTS (2/2)
Today, we have made the largest investment of actual dollars in K-12 education in history - an increase of $200 for every student in every school across the state this year and a $204 increase on top of that next year. #WISOTS (1/2)
So today, I am laying out an Ambitious Agenda for 2018 to keep us headed in the right direction. #WISOTS (5/5)
Those results now allow us to invest record amounts into our schools and into other priorities while still making Wisconsin more affordable for the hard-working taxpayers of this state. Now, we want to keep moving Wisconsin forward. #WISOTS (4/5)
We don‚Äôt want to go back to those days. That would be a giant step backwards. Thankfully, many of us in this chamber today had the courage to make some tough decisions. The results from those tough decisions helped turn our state around. #WISOTS (3/5)
UW tuition was continuing to go up faster than inflation. And Wisconsin consistently ranked in the bottom ten states for business. #WISOTS (2/5)
Eight years ago, things were not very good in our state. There were double-digit tax increases, billion-dollar budget deficits, and record job losses. State aid to schools and local governments was cut with no new tools provided. #WISOTS (1/5)
Eight years ago, in January of 2010, the unemployment rate was 9.2%. Today, the unemployment rate is down to 3.0%. That is well below the national rate of 4.1% and, as I mentioned, it is tied for the lowest unemployment rate in the history of Wisconsin! #WISOTS
We are getting positive things done for the people of Wisconsin. #WISOTS
WI received a bond rating upgrade from 3 national agencies. Our health care systems are ranked number one in the nation for quality. And we announced the largest economic development project in state history. It has been quite an amazing year! A historic year. #WISOTS (2/2)
In Wisconsin, employment is at historic highs and unemployment at historic lows. We invested more actual dollars into schools than ever before in our history. The state property tax is gone. #WISOTS (1/2)
Today, I am proud to declare that the state of our state is historically strong! #WISOTS

Wisconsin‚Äôs unemployment rate was 3.0% in December! This is tied for our lowest unemployment rate on record and is a far cry from its peak at 9.2% in Jan 2010. Our reforms are working and winning for Wisconsin! #WIWorking https://t.co/WJEpMlJgYb
Eight years ago, the state government created a $3.6 billion budget deficit. Today, the state has a more than half a billion-dollar surplus, our pension is fully funded and the rainy day fund is 168 times bigger than when we took office. We are working and winning for Wisconsin! https://t.co/Kf0mVbTKlx
Tonette and I are praying for all affected by today‚Äôs school shooting in Kentucky.
The future of Wisconsin‚Äôs economy depends on the success of today‚Äôs students. That‚Äôs why we‚Äôre working to ensure every student has access to a quality education, opportunities for workforce development, and affordable options for continued learning. #StudentSuccess https://t.co/eduVL0ftjy
Students in our schools have some of the highest ACT scores &amp; best graduation rates in the country. With our historic $11.5 billion investment in education &amp; call for additional Sparsity Aid, we‚Äôre confident WI's students can succeed in college, career &amp; life. #StudentSuccess https://t.co/TZm7qhNiQj
Eight years ago, the previous governor &amp; legislature cut funding for schools &amp; local governments. Our Act 10 reforms have saved them $BILLIONS &amp; allow school leaders to staff based on merit &amp; pay based on performance, ensuring the best &amp; brightest are teaching. #StudentSuccess https://t.co/LeNqmLIZYC
Under Obamacare, premiums for people in the individual market are going up an avg 36%. This is not affordable. Our Health Care Stability Plan will bring premium increases down, provide coverage for those w/ preexisting conditions &amp; offer stability for seniors through SeniorCare. https://t.co/eDBJmVofgx
We are working towards stability in health care. Where Washington failed, Wisconsin will lead. Our Health Care Stability Plan works to ensure coverage for preexisting conditions and SeniorCare and makes individual market insurance more affordable. That‚Äôs #AccountableGov! https://t.co/X3yX8mIuMX
Declared it National School Choice Week throughout Wisconsin. Every student should have access to a great education and every parent should have the freedom to choose what‚Äôs best for their child. Our Ambitious Agenda prioritizes #StudentSuccess in Wisconsin! https://t.co/yRp4Zg60yE
We are reforming state government to make it more efficient, effective &amp; accountable to the hard-working taxpayers of Wisconsin. Health care and welfare reform are just two items on our Ambitious Agenda. Tune in to #WISOTS on Wednesday @ 3PM to hear the rest! https://t.co/PLr0sFQT3S
Expanding access to high-speed internet is important for healthcare, business, education, and quality of life. That‚Äôs why our budget increases broadband investments by $35.5 million. #AccountableGov https://t.co/5HTsmDN5us
We prioritize Wisconsin, not Washington. Since Washington has failed to pass a solution that fixes Obamacare, we will do what we can at the state level to stabilize the market and lower health care costs for people seeing huge premium increases. #AccountableGov https://t.co/re3nx4f1i0
There are hardworking people across our state who are experiencing massive health care premium increases under Obamacare, and that‚Äôs unacceptable. Our Health Care Stability Plan will stabilize our own health care market &amp; make health care more attainable. https://t.co/QcR6IDoF0a
Eight years ago, there were people living in poverty who were on a waitlist for health coverage. Today, everyone living in poverty is covered under BadgerCare. Now we‚Äôre working to make health care more affordable and accessible for all Wisconsinites. #AccountableGov https://t.co/rK1wlDV1yL
This is what it‚Äôs all about. We‚Äôve heard similar stories from people like Kate. With health care insurers leaving the market, rate increases, &amp; consumers facing fewer choices, the individual market needs to be stabilized. We‚Äôre working for Wisconsinites! #AccountableGov https://t.co/aQsjGyHiSY
Our Health Care Stability Plan uses market-based solutions to drive down premiums for people on the individual market, covers preexisting conditions, and makes SeniorCare a permanent state program. This is a comprehensive plan that moves Wisconsin Forward! #AccountableGov https://t.co/4oX1NGfrGq
Tune in to @JeffWagner620 on @620wtmj at 12:30 PM. I‚Äôll be discussing our new Health Care Stability Plan and upcoming State of the State Address. #WISOTS
Wisconsin is one of the best states in the nation for the % of people with access to health care (@uscensusbureau), but there is more work to be done. Our Health Care Stability Plan takes the necessary next steps to ensure everyone has access to &amp; can afford health care in WI. https://t.co/ZpzbZmsMvy
Since Washington has failed to fix major issues with our healthcare system, we need to do what we can at the state level to stabilize our own market &amp; make health care more attainable for people across our state. Our Health Care Stability Plan does just that: https://t.co/arXB7tPSbQ
With health care insurers exiting the market, shock rate increases, &amp; consumers facing fewer choices, the individual market needs to be stabilized. This is not a Republican or Democrat issue. It is a Wisconsin issue that people care about. #AccountableGov 	https://t.co/KEQmDqWXvJ
Under Obamacare, premiums for people in the individual market are going up an average 36%. Our Health Care Stability Plan will bring premiums down to reasonable levels for the hardworking people of Wisconsin. We will lead where Washington fails to act. #AccountableGov https://t.co/8iTAVXgghW
Enjoyed touring ProHealth Waukesha Memorial Hospital to discuss our Health Care Stability Plan. Our seniors and those with preexisting conditions need stability and our plan works to provide it. #AccountableGov https://t.co/QVm2HNbonp
For retirees, our Health Care Stability Plan strives to make SeniorCare a permanent program provided by the state. And for those who seek coverage through the individual market, our plan will provide assistance to keep those premiums from making healthcare coverage unaffordable.
Our Health Care Stability Plan calls on the State Senate to act on a law that will guarantee coverage of pre-existing conditions so that someone who has a serious disease or ailment will not have to worry about obtaining or keeping coverage. https://t.co/z4LOy7hEUA
As I travel the state, I hear your concerns about health insurance. Today, I‚Äôm excited to finally announce our Health Care Stability Plan, a market-driven approach to make healthcare in Wisconsin more stable &amp; affordable. #AccountableGov @WiStateJournal https://t.co/BZe7pfLKCo

Eight years ago, things were not very good in our state with one of the highest state tax burdens in the country. We don‚Äôt want to go back to those days.
