Best summary from S. Zito: Press took Trump literally but not seriously, his supporters took him seriously but not literally. #SHOCircus https://t.co/A6HhK2FZIs
100 percent.  Think @VP @JoeBiden would have won WIsconsin, Pennsylvania and Michigan. @SHOCircus https://t.co/5ZbwDPs6XA
And what always struck me about Trump rallies was that his supporters were passionate. And her crowds were always pretty flat. #SHOCircus https://t.co/sBtXgCcgpW
In the end it was an insider vs outsider choice in a year when more than half the country hungry for something different. #SHOCircus https://t.co/sBtXgCcgpW
Was a troublesome she never got above about 43% in any polls. And was likely mostd undecided voters would break toward Trump. #SHOCircus https://t.co/sBtXgCcgpW
Almost 100 percent about HRC. Obama had one of the highest approval ratings of any incumbent president ever during an election. #SHOCircus https://t.co/RfUp54JjCH
Just not how it works. The decision was HRC's to make not Obama's.  Wouldn't have made a difference anyway. Voters only care @ top of ticket https://t.co/NlqXjY4eX8

Stuart Stevens deserves a lot of credit. Every campaign I've worked with him, he has been a fanatic about debate preparation
One thing you have to say about Mitt Romney.  He delivers when the stakes are high. Good with the ball in the fourth quarter.
Remember all the criticism Romney got for not being out campaigning more because he was preparing for the debate?
RT @AlbertBrooks: Well, I'd rather have a beer with Mitt Romney because he doesn't drink and I could have both of them.
Not even a fair fight. Beatles TKO first round. RT @JoeNBC: The Great Debate: Who do you like more--the Beatles or Rolling Stones?
Truth in campaigns anymore? It's like the campaigns are driving 100 mph when the posted legal mph is 60. But the patrol cars all have flats.
All due respect, but if anyone really thinks debates don't matter, please review 2000 race.  Pre-debate George Bush down 3-5. Post up three.
