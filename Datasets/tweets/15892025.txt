@TampaBayTre Taking all at their prime, I'd switch Megatron and Moss, and TO and Rice.  Megatron could do everything Moss could do and more, but his prime only lasted 2-3 seasons, where everyone else was more durable. Completely agree with top five WRs.

@Redruckus81 Heard an interesting analysis last Summer say Quinn &amp; T.Austin were destined to fail together.  TA required pass rushing DLine, BQ learned to evaluate in NE where pass rush DL is an expensive luxery, in favor of gap control. BQ drafts &amp; signings so far say analyst may be right.
@Redruckus81 Agreed, especially not for full season anyway.  Hope he makes us both look like jackasses...
@Redruckus81 I think that is specifically what DKennard was signed for.  I also think Davis and Jones have both size and speed if asked.  While we have Ziggy, I expect they'll use him. But I don't think pass rushing DLine is important now as in Austin's D. Maybe why Quinn never replaced Suh.
@Redruckus81 Big stretch to say Lions have no good pass rush.  Depending on Ziggy and Hyder's health, we may simply have no pass rush on the Dline. In NE, Patricia used his Dline to hold gaps, and rush with LBs.

@Finchty Lions trusted Tate, Jones, and Goliday more than Ebron to be their #1, 2, 3 options, and didn't want to pay their 4th best receiver $8M. Willson isn't as good, but he is a professional.
@Finchty Ebron has a great amount of talent. His problem had always been effort and maturity.  He can be a great tight end, but he's never gone more than 1/2 season without getting upset and shutting down.
Because he's not a real person. He's a legend transferred from another world to solve all our problems.  That's the image 45% of voters bought in 2016. If you want something to derail him, look at Russia, his business ethics, taxes, his family. Leave the affairs to the tabloids.
No, the fact that many of President Trump's supporters come from the  "family values" camp won't change that admiration one bit. And since the Access  Hollywood tape didn't turn off his female supporters, neither will this.
@StormyDaniels and @karenmcdougal98 are exactly the type of women  (famous, beautiful, young, somewhat scandalous) Hollywood tells us men of Trump's status cheat on their wives with.
People voted for Trump because he was larger than life caricature, promising everything in the world in one easy swipe. Despite having a pregnant and equally gorgeous wife at the time, the affairs, alleged duel affairs, only build that image he ran and won off of.
As much as @realDonaldTrump critics want the affair with the Playboy Bunny and the Adult Film star to bring down his Presidency, I only see it endearing him to his supporters and making him more popular to people on the fence like the @MonicaLewinsky scandal did with @BillClinton
