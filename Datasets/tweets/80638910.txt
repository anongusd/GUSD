Also, because this is already ridiculously long, I’ll make it longer by saying a thank you to @RonanFarrow and @NewYorker. They used access to the VVVIP rooms to expose wrongdoing at the pinnacle of power.  That’s rare. END 13/
I think that we need to build new, independent news sources with leadership that is diverse from day one. It will create a different culture at work, and bring more people’s experiences into the news.  12/
Personally I don’t believe the established media institutions will change. They’ll get rid of the worst actors and make cosmetic adjustments. 11/
Across the news industry many women are working in similar environments. Many news organizations are aggressively covering wrongdoing in other industries while keeping their own secret. 10/
This is the killer quote from the story. “A lot of my memories of ‘60 Minutes’ are of other women coming into my office, closing the door, and just breaking down because of working as a woman at CBS..." 9/
The accounts are devastating and the denials are just gross. Jeff Fager is actually quoted saying that one of the women has “an axe to grind.” Seriously? Imagine what he'd do with that if an interview subject said it on 60 Mins.8/
Too many news leaders have been hiding their own dirty laundry while reporting on everyone else’s. 7/
I’m most interested in the bit at the end of the piece. The part about CBS News, 60 Minutes and Jeff Fager. It speaks to a moral corruption inside old media institutions. 6/
It causes you to call everything into question. Your work. The limits of your own courage. It impacts your news judgment. It changes the way you see the world.  That impacts how you frame the news. 5/
So when you get harassed or watch it happen to your friends and those same managers silence you, make you pretend it didn’t happen, and enable the harassers it is disillusioning, stifling. Not just personally but professionally too. 4/
There’s a unique awfulness to experiencing and witnessing workplace harassment as a journalist. You go into the field to get to the truth. You see your news managers tell the public that they’re dedicated to exposing abuse, holding power to account. 3/
What Ronan describes is a kind of moral corruption that exists at the highest levels of many newsrooms. I’ve seen it up close. 2/
The @RonanFarrow @NewYorker piece is cathartic. It speaks to the integrity of the people who decide what counts as news. Not just at CBS. 1/

Our ultimate job is not just to be liberated, not simply to celebrate our people’s freedom, but to become the liberator of slaves and the tireless defender and protector of those who suffer fromspiritual and physical hunger. 	- Elianna Yolkut @rabbielianna
We have no choice but to start the seder with a focus on the needs of others, for what other purpose is our freedom but to reach out to those suffering, those who are not free? The journey through the seder night begins with words to implore us not to leave others to suffer.5/
Thus, the focus of hunger and need at the start of our seder reminds us from the outset that our work is not done. As free Jews we have an obligation to continue the work of Tikkun Olam (Repairing the World) 4/
one aspect of our liberation still remains elusive: we are still distant from the ultimate redemption. Too many go to bed hungry, too many still die of illnesses for which there are cures, and too many suffer the deadening blows of bigotry and prejudice 3/

RT @sfpathe: DCCC chairman https://t.co/UNu7WY8VsF
2/ Creating a workplace in which women feel they can't report harassment isn't exonerating. Social science (and my opinion) suggests it’s a failure of leadership. See:	https://t.co/97zao9CaCV 	https://t.co/pfOL55RBfd	https://t.co/dG8e7NrMGR
1/  Missing the point. This speaks to a problem with the culture and leadership of the workplace.	 “There was never a complaint about Matt,” Jeff Zucker said. “There was never a suggestion of that kind of deviant or predatory behavior.”https://t.co/vnAf0l3xlM #MattLauer
I hear ya.	It’s not about the bad apple. 	It’s about the bad barrel. And the bad barrel makers. https://t.co/SdIlrtm3sJ
7/ No surprise here. The same study finds that for women who report harassment "concerns regarding retaliation appear to be warranted. Women who filed a formal complaint, compared to women who did not, reported more negative treatment at work as a result." https://t.co/GRKeC89zjH
6/ This study has a ton of good info: "Sexual harassment affects the organization because targeted employees report decreased performance + organizational commitment, as well as increased withdrawal, turnover, + team conflict..." https://t.co/FDFv7NwAxo https://t.co/LiOdInvk0Q
It's a little more nuanced. Putting one or two women in leadership doesn't work. Research shows-- when 30% of the roles are filled by women, the culture shifts. It's about changing the culture. See, for example, https://t.co/FDFv7NwAxo and #BroadInfluence by @JNSmall https://t.co/9j6DQkUBZb
5/ "The key feature that distinguishes harass-ing from non-harassing conduct is the fact that it is unwelcome, not reciprocated, and considered inappropriate according to shared societal standards." From Sexual harassment: Motivations and consequences https://t.co/1MQfQtJHjg https://t.co/H82l4cSzvt
4/ Third, cracking down on harassers reduces overall harassment. That is, showing  that the behavior won't be tolerated by any, reduces harassment by others. It means the tone is set at the top. Leadership. https://t.co/8Tp7ykFowJ
3/ Second, very hierarchical workplaces are more prone to harassment. One remedy -- establishing an external body to which emloyees can report harassment and/or anonymous reporting mechanisms. https://t.co/QZr1N4p868
2/ First, put more women in senior leadership. Research shows women  (in real #s) are more likely to recognize harassment, less likely to support normalizing "locker room" culture. https://t.co/mZO9whQ5YK

Yes! Problem is getting the campaigns or debate commission to agree on the team of researchers... https://t.co/yDqgj9L1Np
Second half, much harder. Questions written by group of researchers pre-approved by the commission...? Other ideas? https://t.co/BdBJn1rOnT
Yah I conveniently glossed over that;)    1st half just time keepers- members of debate commission could do that. https://t.co/BdBJn1rOnT
Better system? Let candidates full-out debate for the 1st 45 mins. Spend next 45 mins addressing claims they made in 1st half.
Fair point. But the moderators are backed by researchers who've had time to prep. https://t.co/DKlzTfIAxe
3/ Muzzling moderator is worst of all worlds. https://t.co/Yg6GVUqb6P
2/ But if the culture says a moderator from tv press can't be trusted - let future candidates go head to head. No moderator. https://t.co/Yg6GVUqb6P

So @HassanRouhani is saying give peace a chance, but no concrete steps to ease nuclear concerns. So...this one's on Kerry too?

RT @KevinBohnCNN: Just in: @evanperez reports FBI has determined there was only one shooter
At WH @BarackObama calls DC Navy Yard killing "another mass shooting"...implicitly tying it to gun violence he's highlighted since Newtown.
Style points? Potus nearly invokes his own 2012 campaign video "The Road We've Traveled" describing the Syria crisis w/ George.
@thisweek: potus confirms letters w Iran new president + Iran obtaining nuclear weapon is core national security issue to US, unlike syria

At G20 presser @BarackObama refuses to say for 3d time what he'd do if Congress votes no. Tho gives @BriKeilarcnn props for her question.
At G20, @BarackObama just ducked @brikeilarcnn when pressed whether he'd strike if congress votes no. Seems staff got ahead of him. @vplus.

@ConserveTruth13 why not ask ppl to read whole convo in context? I asked a Q, then flagged most common answers.
And this feeds more debate (dissension) in Obama vs Clinton era RT @olafbockholt No twitter. No facebook. No (total) deadlock in politics.
Other big view why more debate now than '98 RT@johnmoz "We found WMD" skepticism; experience getting bogged down in Iraq &amp; Afghanistan.
Lots of ppl share this view re why wasn't there sim debate before '98 afghan strike RT@stephenfhayes US embassies hit, Americans killed
Why more public debate now than Clinton '98 strike. Public demands more transparency? '98 was response to attack at US? US wary-post Iraq?
When Clinton ordered '98 afghan strike, wasn't similar public debate in advance. Why now?
