@silversilx @chrislhayes @NancyPelosi Its about amplifying a voice, getting media attention, and mobilizing the democrats to stand up to something. Pelosi lacks the ability, and seemingly the interest, to do that. Agreed it's not all on her, but she is the most pwerful democrat in America.
@silversilx @chrislhayes @NancyPelosi Her title will be "speaker" - that is inherently a communications role
@chrislhayes The lack of a strong democrative message on problemts like this proves to me that @NancyPelosi was the wrong choice to lead Democrats. #SameOlParty
