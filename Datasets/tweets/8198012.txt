@ThatSportsGamer @mangowhizz Totally. Just mentioned that in another reply.
@mangowhizz Same! But also the Hulu doc paid for the MacFarland interview, which makes me feel a little queasy. One-off productions don't have a contract w the audience about their adherence to standard journalistic ethics. Great and important work can be made, but buyer beware.
After learning that the Netflix Fyre doc was produced by one of the subjects of the movie (Jerry Media), it's important to remember that nonfiction movies aren't necessarily journalism. Same goes with books. They can be good &amp; accurate, but they are not held to the same standard

It's the character having a microsecond of relief from torment and feeling the power of that and I think Crispin Glover is a genius for it.
I'll give an example. There's a moment when George McFly is being bullied in the diner by Biff and the bullying focuses on Marty for a second and George immediately joins the bullies and starts jeering for just a split second. It is so human &amp; understandable &amp; pathetic &amp; real. https://t.co/hAeEDHok10

@Wrigleyade @WGNflag wow!
Nicole Sawaya was like no one else and I owe her my entire career.
She demanded a lot and I like to think I made her proud.
About 8 months into my time there, she asked me to create a show she could put on Sunday afternoons after This American Life. I created, produced, &amp; hosted Invisible Ink, a half hour weekly show. I made 44 episodes in the first year. Unpaid &amp; without a staff.
She put me on the air as a fund raiser during pledge drives because she liked my voice and we were always in competition about who could raise more money in a given hour. I learned my hustle from her.
I‚Äôve never met anyone so driven by the mission and spirit of public broadcasting. She was never the boring and staid caricature of public radio. She thought the nonprofit, commercial free, public service mission mandated that we be bold and daring.
In 2001 and 2002, new shows were starting at KALW right and left because of Nicole‚Äôs energy and drive. It was such an exciting place to be.
Many of the veteran Announcer Operators (AOs) got so mad at her for that, be she always stood by me. The two AOs who supported me, Joe Burke and Alan Farley (RIP), loved new blood in what was then a sleepy station and always had my back too.
She allowed me to use the station as my radio school and playground. I worked on every kind of show that needed help. She pushed me to be on the air and had me trained as a Board Op/ Announcer.
In 2001, Nicole was the new General Manager of KALW 91.7 in San Francisco and after I applied for and got rejected by everyone: KQED, TAL, Sound Portraits (now StoryCorps) and numerous others, KALW, which had no internship program, let me come in as a volunteer.
I just learned today that the person who got me started in public radio, Nicole Sawaya, has died.

@laurie_winkless @aibazin @BloomsburyBooks @ScienceAndCity @CaraSantaMaria Nice to meet you! Thanks!
@brucery @martinaustwick Tell it to Houghchette Mifhousebury Girouxguin!
Well, it looks like I pre-sold 1000 copies in the first hour, so that's totally worth a seven figure deal, right?
@brucery You're a mind reader! The pitch *is* a series...
@RickZich I definitely have. I'm interested in the prospect of learning from a publisher and reaching new people who don't know the show and think the traditional route is worth exploring. If it doesn't work I'll DIY. I know that world all too well.
@nightlightguy I really wish you the best of luck. My best friend has a lot of frustration as a writer and it's very hard.
@jkarmon A coffee table book can totally be appealing but I'm looking to get something out to people who might not currently know the show and that format seems designed to super-serve the core audience (of people I love and owe everything to, but I think you get my meaning)
@isonno Maaaaaybe
@nightlightguy That's infuriating. As much advantage as I have here, some of them will try something similar with me. Gatekeepers are like that. I hope you kept trying.
@jjerome I'm exploring the idea of working with a publisher because one of the goals is to reach people who aren't already fans of 99pi. If I sense they can't deliver that or just don't seem fun to work with, I'll do it myself. I have a lifetime of doing it myself, so I'm trying this out
@PowersBenny who?
@aibazin @BloomsburyBooks @laurie_winkless @ScienceAndCity I'm excited to learn about this book. Ordered!
@EricaJoy Thank you! I think so too, but a lot of people ask me to do things and end up not really meaning it in the end and I just do it myself. Which is fine, but I'm kind of hoping for an enthusiastic partner in this venture for a change.
@konilsson Not quite that, but I swear it'll be interesting
Mustering up some Twitter-based courage.
@leebutterman If I don't like the way these meetings go (and I tend not to like them) I'll go that route, for sure.
@rawbbie I should probably make my tweets more inspirational then.
@JimJimsonJr That's not what I have in mind this go round, but it will be its own beautiful object, I swear. Just a slightly different form factor. I'll keep this is mind, though. Thanks!

@josiahq @prx @radiotopia Thanks, friend!
@josiahq @prx @radiotopia PRX is a distributor of audio. They distribute national radio shows to stations. They partner with pubradio to make apps &amp; pioneer new tech. One of thing they did was push the idea of pub media podcasts forward by partnering w me to create Radiotopia, a self-funded project in PRX

If you have what it takes and want to help us reach more audience and tell the @PRX story, come work with us! Do something good for you and good for the world. It‚Äôs going to be so cool. https://t.co/ZwvedThtUh
.@PRX is looking for a much needed and long overdue Chief Marketing Officer and I want them to find the best of the best. https://t.co/ZwvedThtUh
That‚Äôs where you come in, Marketing Genius
They have a story to tell, but part of what makes them so great, is their humility, which sometimes thwarts their best efforts to get that story out in the world
@Radiotopia exists as it does because @PRX is what it is
They are good and just and punk rock and fair to their core
They engineered their own dynamic ad serving technology for podcasts; everything they make serves the creators they work with.
They help tiny podcasts and distribute juggernauts like @ThisAmerLife and @serial
They‚Äôve worked with every radio station and radio maker and have proven time and time again that they can work and play with everyone and are just driven by the mission of getting excellent, quality stories to an audience that will love and support the creators
After I raised a record-breaking amount of money on Kickstarter, I partnered with them to create @Radiotopia. The goal was to take this model of committed, indie ownership to the best producers &amp; have them run their own shows and reach an audience that would support them directly
They created a new online service for independent, major distributors to deliver content to stations bypassing the costly out-of-date satellite system.
They then designed and built the pioneering public radio apps
PRX started as a way to bridge independent audio makers to radio stations by creating an online marketplace for distribution. This was revolutionary.
For 15 years @PRX has served as the R&amp;D department for mission driven public media
Let me tell you about @PRX

I think it's one reason why two person podcasts work well naturally. And if the story keeps moving and the ear doesn't get bored, the overall length could be infinite and still pleasing. That's the point.
Getting a lot of hate on this. All this means is that someone should come to a point, develop the thought, get interrupted, change the sound, or have the conversation continue within ~2 minutes. It's the audio equivalent of saying it's easier to read books with paragraphs.

@dada_drummer I always believed in you.
@imontheradio If you can pull off reading them, god love ya. I mostly cannot.
Always work with the audio itself. Transcripts lie. Paper lies.
If you can‚Äôt think of anything interesting to say, don‚Äôt say anything. It usually means the tape speaks for itself.
Listen to a lot of audio stories and steal the best parts. Even if you try to do it exactly like someone else, you won‚Äôt be able to, and you‚Äôll create something new.
You can either do a lot of pre-production and capture something great on tape or record everything and do a lot of post-production to make it great. Regardless, it‚Äôs the production work that makes it great.
Very few people are talented enough to be interesting without extensive production. You are probably not one of them. But it‚Äôs OK. Production is the great equalizer. Put the work in and your show can be great.
Before you start writing the next section, listen to what you have up to that point. It‚Äôs your onramp and will make writing the next part easier. Plus, it‚Äôll probably make you realize it‚Äôs time to wrap it up.
If you have 100,000 listeners and you edit out one useless minute you are saving 100,000 wasted minutes in the world. You‚Äôre practically a hero.
Listen to it with other people. You will feel the boring parts and the parts that aren‚Äôt working when someone else is listening.
Play it out loud and edit again.
Edit again.
Edit.
You are not just ‚Äúbeing yourself.‚Äù You are performing as the character of you. There‚Äôs a difference.
Speak plainly. If you stumble on a word or phrase a lot, rewrite it.
Get really close to the mic.
Find all the places for joy you can.
People‚Äôs attention span for audio stories lasts about two minutes. Make sure the rhythm of your story doesn‚Äôt exceed that limit too often.
Violate the acts and tracks format at least once in the piece.
Adding the music is the fun part; do it well. Probably don‚Äôt play a single piece of music for more than two minutes, unless you‚Äôre Joe Frank or Benjamen Walker.
Do at least one thing that makes you laugh or really pleases you in the piece.
If they say it well, let them say it. If they don‚Äôt, you write it and say it.
Fall in love with your subject‚Äôs voice.
Find your favorite piece of tape and get to it as fast as you can.

@squalortoballer @abitofcolor @LEVIS very kind of you! We seem to have nice people working on multiple fronts, so I'm hopeful.
@abitofcolor @squalortoballer @LEVIS We tried all the normal ways, hence this.
@ksofis @LEVIS oooh, thank you!
@FinalCutKing @MOMSforCOMEDY @LEVIS thank you!
Can someone help connect me with a historian at @LEVIS in SF? We are working on a very cool story and they're so critical to it, it would be awful not to have them. If you know someone there, tell them we're good!
@probablyaliens @johnroderick @SongExploder it's one of my favorite episodes of anything
I implore every company, store, restaurant, etc. to not value the "Super Bowl" trademark. Use the term freely and often! It's an event I don't give a fuck about, but it has been shoved down our throats for so long, it really belongs to all of us.

@Erinescence I think it's because we're direct object shy after being corrected on me/I for so many years.
@NearNriver Huh, that's interesting. I don't think the words necessarily indicate that difference, but if people are interpreting them that way, it makes sense. Thanks!
@catglum I still don't quite see why "use" doesn't do the job
@stephens_ben It feels like the way cops speak
I will say I do dislike when people use the word "utilize" rather than "use."
I may regret mentioning something about grammar on twitter, but here goes: in the past few years I've noticed more and more people saying "addicting" rather than "addictive" and I don't get why. Don't hate it, just don't get it.
