Deforestation occurs when residential development is valued above forestland. Strong markets for forest products in the U.S. have led to almost 70 years of growing more forests. More demand for wood = more trees planted by forest owners. #forestproud #trees #timberinnovationact https://t.co/tcpVqmD5j3
Who doesn't love time-lapse footage? Strong markets for wood products, like mass timber, ensure we continue to see continued forest growth year-over-year in the US! More demand = more trees! Watch this building made with #MassTimber go up in Minneapolis.	https://t.co/FHzWguxqoX

Sustainable forestry is practiced on a massive landscape scale. By staggering harvests, NAFO members are stewards of forested lands at every stage of their life cycle. Our young forests are also a vital part of sustaining wildlife! https://t.co/penyr53u7s
But what are the main causes of deforestation? In the US, it's conversion to other uses like development or farmland. If we want to reap the benefits from forests, we must continue to have strong markets for forest products! 	Strong markets = more trees.üå≤	https://t.co/aP5pu5JMxt https://t.co/fuqp3lFC7p
