Surplus Recurrent revenue grew from N2billion in Kaduna2018Budget to N41billions in #Kaduna2019Budget. Commendations to @GovKaduna, @elrufai &amp; @Dattijo for realising d need to save for capital expenditures from revenues @calped4devt @perlnigeria @SakoRebecca @Obeweh @GBulus
With #2019KadunaBudget tagged 'Budget of Continuity', it was difficult analyzing the budget without half-year Performance Report for #2018Budget. Though at N155billions, the budget looks realistic especially with IGR project of N41billions @KDMobp @elrufai @Dattijo @calped4devt
#2019KadunaBudget Proposal looks more implementable than that of previous years. Unlike in the 2018KadunaBudget where 68% of capita expenditure was predicated on external loan #2019KadunaBudget has only 19% of capital projections on loans. Good lesson learned #2019BudgetTownHall

If Citizens are consulted in all matters by politicians, there won't be fight. When personal glory and entitlement becomes the focal point, fight ensues. #CitizensVoice, #CitizensPower, #voicesCount, #Livesmatter
Citizens must not be the grass that suffers when two elephants fight. Citizens should be the reason why they first in the first place #VoicesCount #NigeriaFirst #LivesMatter
Governance must be at the centre of all discussions between politicians. Anything less is disservice to the citizens. 	Politics is about service and Citizens deserve attention not personalities. #VoicesCount #LivesMatter #NigeriaFirst #Reset-Nigeria
@Opengovpart will lead to comprehensive citizens participation in decisions that affect their lives. CSOs/NGOs must make sure information is accessible to the most vulnerable @ogpnigeria #OGPGeorgia
