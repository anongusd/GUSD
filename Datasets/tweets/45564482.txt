Thanks so much everybody for your time and great questions. My book is called THE UNINHABITABLE EARTH: LIFE AFTER WARMING. Now, back to the regular New York programming... https://t.co/c9MQ8s1D3Z
And though I hope we won't have to live in a world that is three or four degrees warmer — I hope we can do everything we can to avoid it — my book is an early, kaleidoscopic attempt to explore what it would be like if we did.
How we'll adapt — and in what ways these forces will transform every aspect of the modern world we so take for granted — is an enormous open question.
It is almost as though we have all traveled to another planet, governed by another set of climate conditions, which threaten to continue to change below our feet and all around us.
The planet is already now hotter than it's ever been in the entire history of humanity, which means no human has ever walked a planet as hot as this one before.
We are adapting too, and will continue to. That adaptation is the core inquiry of my book: what will life look like in forty years, or seventy? How will we have reorganized our societies, our politics, our energy use, our agriculture—not to mention our movies and tech addictions.
But we also have new, hybrid species—animals forced together for the first time and mating. That is how we've gotten pizzly bears and coy wolves. There will surely be more in the coming decades—and the zoos are already out of date.
All species are adapting all the time—those that are surviving. According to the World Wildlife Fund, more than half of all vertebrate mammals have died since just 1970. https://t.co/uWcWjVGSfg
Everything is in our power. The scale of the horrors that are possible are a reminder of just how *much* control we have over the climate. Nothing is written in stone, nothing is inevitable, and both our politics and our energy sectors are changing *fast*. https://t.co/55Dg0hYQ7h
What that would mean for the world is horrifying, but we can't look away from it, as we have for too long. If we do, we will continue to live in complacency and denial and lose our opportunity to avoid the worst of it.
But the conceptual problem is a really significant one, to me. Every time we look out the window we anchor our expectations for the future in the climate of the present. But that is irrational. The range of likely temperatures for the end of the century lies between 2° and 4°.
It depends a lot on how we respond—theoretically, we could build a sea-wall to protect the city. But these projects take time, and we may not have enough of it to prevent the flooding of parts of south Brooklyn and Queens. https://t.co/628ZCf8p2m
My book is a first effort to sketch the shape of that landscape, and to see what it means for all of us.
This is just one reason I think climate change is a profound and totalizing threat, one that will touch every aspect of all of our lives going forward, in ways we are only beginning to appreciate.
There is already great research, for instance, on climate trauma—which affects not only those directly impacted by natural disasters but many of those nearby, as well. And by 2100, if we don't change course, there are places that could be hit with six natural disasters at once.
But of course this isn't a complete answer, and unfortunately I think the truth is that many more of us will be learning to live amidst more eco-anxiety, and more climate suffering, in the decades ahead.
Voting is the smallest ask, but mobilizing plays a crucial role too—so that even if we elect leaders who make climate change a first-order political priority, we can then hold them accountable to those promises.
This is a really important question, and to me, at least, has a very simple answer: politics and mobilization. Writing the book has given shape to my own anxiety, but everyone can adopt some "project" like that by engaging in politics and organizing. https://t.co/vWBYlrdzpW
Extreme weather is a great teacher—wildfires, heatwaves, hurricanes. https://t.co/1yEMJCzER4
Nature has reviewed it very positively, too, which is nice. But my favorite response so far has been the one by @susanematthews in Slate, which really gets into the book's focus on what I think of as the "humanities of climate change." https://t.co/SbvVBfmOwh
I sent parts of the book to many scientists to review, including those who'd taken issue with my original piece, and incorporated their feedback and corrections into the manuscript.
Very positive, I'd say. The climate conversation has, I think, changed in the interim—mostly because of the IPCC's alarming report from last October, but also because of all the extreme weather we've seen. https://t.co/qq1ZZmVBYZ
For me this is an all-of-the-above solution for governments — cut carbon! — and a single answer for individuals — politics! To me, it's very important to keep in mind that there is no silver bullet for this problem, because it is too complicated and too diffuse. https://t.co/lyVnS3k5M7
And how quickly and how aggressively we might act to avert those impacts, and secure something like a habitable and prosperous future for the planet—the whole planet.
The big question is, how will climate reshape our maps? Not just literally, in the case of coastlines, or demographically, by forcing migrations, but how it will change our collective understanding of our place on the planet and in history.
I don't think the planet will become unlivable on any time scale it makes sense to contemplate—which is to say, I don't think it's going to happen over many centuries, at least. But parts of the world are already unlivable, and the area is growing—in some places, quite rapidly. https://t.co/EsvAIbdJKd
I think of divestment as a morally honorable action to take on climate, but one whose impact is ultimately small and slow. And so while I applaud it, personally I don't think it should be the focus of our efforts... https://t.co/raNSPbDTIr
The question is: will we choose to? Or, perhaps more precisely, when will we choose to?
The scale of climate suffering that is possibly over the next century is, in a perverse way, a remind of our human control over it. Nothing is inevitable, and we have all the tools we need, today, to avert it.
More importantly, I think rather than fleeing in the face of climate change, we should do everything we can to secure the future for ourselves and children and grandchildren that we want.
That means, I think, that many people in the world will continue to live as you describe, even if the world *does* crumble — by any standard we'd use today.
I think the sad truth is that, however many climate horrors we bring into being — and they aren't inevitable, if they happen it'll be because we have let them happen — much of humanity will endure and continue to live in compartmentalized ways, looking away from suffering. https://t.co/aeHraPcElV
I think the honest answer is, not very much. But that is why politics is so important. How much beef you eat, or how many flights you take, has a trivial impact on our global carbon footprint. But through voting — and organizing — the impacts multiply rapidly. https://t.co/uu2mtOIyhk
@daisebedolla This is the story I try to tell in my book: just how dramatically the forces of climate change will impact all aspects of life on this planet. We have not yet begun to reckon with the scale of changes that are possible—if we don't act to avoid them.
@daisebedolla Everywhere you look in the modern world, you see the fingerprint of climate change—and that fingerprint will grow much heavier in the coming decades, so that the 21st century may be defined by the force of climate change in much the way that previous eras were by "modernity."
@daisebedolla Climate change promises to impact agriculture (cutting grain yields by 50% or more by the end of the century if we don't change course), conflict (doubling war and increasing rates of rape and murder), economic growth (reducing global GDP by 20%+).
@daisebedolla I'm a lot more straw-agnostic than most. Plastic in the ocean has an undeniable aesthetic effect on people, but I worry it might distract energy from reduction of carbon, which is much more important—its effects so much farther reaching and significant.
@kathleenq @dwallacewells To do that, they say, will require a global mobilization against climate at the scale of mobilization in World War II. I think things are moving fast, but we're very far from that scale of effort...
@kathleenq @dwallacewells The problem is, we don't have that long. The U.N. says we'll need to halve our global emissions by 2030 to avoid what is often called the "threshold of catastrophe" and which island nations of the world describe as "genocide."
@kathleenq @dwallacewells Those public opinion figures — 73% of Americans think climate change is real and happening now, 70% are concerned — suggest that even in a tribalized partisan environment, the Republican party may not much longer be able to play climate denier or skeptic.
@kathleenq @dwallacewells I think there's great reason for optimism here. Already, the Democratic party is in an entirely different place on climate than it was just a few years ago, with all the major presidential aspirants signing onto the Green New Deal—in theory, at least.
@LaurenStarke @dwallacewells Its historical role — and the benefits it's accrued from the burning of fossil fuels — means the U.S. has a moral obligation to play the role of climate leader. But no matter how aggressive U.S. policy gets, the future of the planet will be drawn by other countries, namely China.
@LaurenStarke @dwallacewells Of course, the U.S. accounts for only fifteen percent of all emissions, though our share of historical emissions is much larger. But going forward the future of the planet's climate will be driven much more by China, India, and sub-Saharan Africa.
@LaurenStarke @dwallacewells In fact, the text of the resolution — which is not binding legislation but a kind of statement of principles — literally opens with quoted text from the U.N.'s IPCC reports. That *alone* is a major watershed for American politics.
@LaurenStarke @dwallacewells It's extremely exciting! I think there is a ton to still be hammered out, and major questions to be answered about it. But finally we have a climate policy that takes seriously the meaning of the science: that terrifying levels of suffering are possible if we don't act NOW.
@ashnic0592 This is the real subject of my book—not what climate change is, or what it will do, but what it means, and how it will transform all of our lives in the century ahead.
@ashnic0592 And we are only just beginning to peek at that new politics of climate, which also promises to transform our culture and storytelling, our relationship to technology and to capitalism, our perspective on history and sense of obligation to one another and as nations.
@ashnic0592 The question is how quickly that energy can be leveraged into policy and political change, which is what's most important.
@ashnic0592 But we are already seeing a new politics of climate emerge—with the school strikes of Greta Thunberg, with Extinction Rebellion and Sunrise and the Green New Deal.
@ashnic0592 They will get worse—estimates are, by the end of the century, barring a change of course on carbon emissions, perhaps 64 times worse.
@ashnic0592 Not everyone feels an intense commitment to climate action—yet. But in a perverse way extreme weather and natural disaster are great teachers on this. Wildfires in particular, I think, have really woken people up in places like the U.S.
@ashnic0592 I think most people do care—in the U.S., often thought of as a hotbed of climate denial, more than 70% believe climate change is happening and are concerned about it. That number is up 15 points from 2015 and 8 points since March.
@thecatsmeow94 @dwallacewells No, not all of us—not at all. But the impacts of climate change are already extreme, especially in the global south, and nine million people are dying each year from air pollution alone today. That number alone should terrify and shame us into action.
I'll be answering any questions you have for the next half hour or so—about warming, habitability, climate politics and the Green New Deal...
