Also, campaign handing out new signs here: “Kamala Harris Para La Gente.”
Harris’s campaign has provided headsets that will translate this town hall for Spanish-speaking attendees. Nevada said to be the early test case for how candidates are appealing to Latino voters. Big round of applause when they announced the translation was available.
Talking to voters before Harris’s town hall, and one of them said he wants to see her win the nomination because “if he [POTUS] has to stand across from her on the debate stage I think he’ll pee his pants.”		Today is the day I learned not to try to predict voter motivations.
An hour before Kamala Harris’s Friday afternoon town hall in North Las Vegas, there’s a line out the door, through a courtyard, and out another gate. Continues to draw in hordes.

@JamalCollier Trying to figure out where Bryce is signing with the rest of us
Who will be president when Bryce Harper’s deal expires?
Apparently “stick to politics” is the new “where’s Bryce signing”
One more thing: if you and I thought it was frustrating waiting for Harper to get his deal, think of it this way — he enjoyed the free agent process so much he signed a 13-year-deal with no opt-outs.
The 2019 National League East is going to be, as the kids say, lit.
Also, I am not in the Nationals clubhouse this spring, but can say for sure this won’t qualify as devastating to morale. Organization had moved on, and in so doing knew they might have to face him over and over again for years. https://t.co/usYYTGmMK7
1) I guess it was all about getting the biggest number (possible and ever) all along. 		2) Would have been worse for Phillies not to get him than it is for Nats that Phillies got him, but not great for Nats. They’re gonna have to put him on a whole lot at CBP for next 13 years.

Asked if she will take any big donor or PAC money for her campaign, Harris says “I won’t be taking corporate PAC money or federal lobbyist money,” which obviously isn’t a clear “no.” She’s not the only member of the field phrasing her answer to that question this way.
Add “drink every time a Democratic candidate says ‘I will not conduct foreign policy by tweet’ to your 2020 primary drinking game rules, then prepare for one heck of a hangover.

Harris, Castro, and Hickenlooper are all at the Story County Democrats’ soup dinner in Ames right now.
Whoever helped Harris select “My Shot” from a Hamilton as her walk-off music should open a business consulting MLB players on their walk-up music and never look back.
Voter asked Harris if, in a hypothetical situation where Dems had control of Congress and the White House, she would urge Senate to do away with the filibuster.		“That’s a great question. I’m conflicted, to be honest with you.”
Harris gets asked to clarify healthcare stance, if she would support people keeping private coverage: 		“In my vision of Medicare-for-All, there would be a phasing in of it, and there would still be an option for people to have private coverage for supplemental insurance.”
Harris gets asked about foreign policy. Goes down a long list of priorities, working with allies, leading with our values, etc.		“And I guess the last point is this: I would read the briefing books.”
Apparently Nora wrote Harris a letter urging her to run for President. So I guess this was her idea. https://t.co/XlwOmP5tvo

To clarify on this point, Booker said he would not do away with private “healthcare.” Harris talked about getting rid of private insurance. Some say a distinction without a difference, but I’ll let you decide if you’re one of that some or if this changes your understanding.

Buttigieg says he supports Medicare for All, but “maybe Medicare for More” is a good interim step.
Asked for bold policy ideas, Buttigieg largely dodges, but he wants to look at “doing away with the electoral college...even if that requires an amendment to the Constitution. 		“We shouldn’t be afraid of structural change.”
Buttigieg: “The most important thing in my life, my marriage to Chasten, exists by virtue of a single vote on the Supreme Court.” So, he says, he understands the human effects of politics.
Buttigieg on what he brings that the rest of the field doesn’t: “Of the people who have jumped in, I’m the only one living a middle class lifestyle in a middle class neighborhood in middle America.”

Gillibrand gets (a, if not the) million dollar question: About 20 Democrats will be running, what separates you?		Gillibrand: “I believe I can bring the country together.” Cites diversity of people she’s represented in NY state, her success in doing so, as evidence.
Someone asked Gillibrand to convince him why he should have faith in our institutions:		“You shouldn’t have faith in Congress...we need to change the players’ list.” 		Says McConnell has too much power, need to flip the Senate and White House.
Ex: “In case President Trump doesn’t know this, he needs to know this: Puerto Ricans are Americans...he’s completely turned his back on them.”
Unlike Warren on her Iowa swing, Gillibrand hasn’t been shy about using Trump’s name. Reiterating, stop after stop, that he is spreading ”a darkness.”

In Storm Lake, which is one of the more diverse communities in Iowa, Warren reiterated need for “comprehensive immigration reform.” 		“I’m willing to compromise. I know I won’t get everything I want. I know nobody else is going to get everything they want, either.”
The man had been heckling Warren — “control the border!” — as she wrapped up her conversation with the overflow crowd. According to people in the crowd, someone grabbed his Trump 2020 banner. He whacked back with what I think was his selfie stick. Security immediately step in.

Early word on Tanner Rainey: Has back end of the bullpen potential, hard thrower, but has some adjustments to make.
Some perspective on the state of the Nationals: Reds Pres. of Baseball Ops. Dick Williams said the Reds haven't committed to players making this much money a lot lately. It's a big investment for them. He was the fourth-highest paid guy in the Nats rotation.
Roark on the deal: "If they can live with it, they can live with it."
Roark admitted there were times as he bounced from bullpen to rotation, etc, that he got "frustrated" and "pissed off" with the way the Nationals handled him, but said it made him mentally tough.
Roark said he was "surprised," but said that's the business.
Tanner Roark and the Nationals went through a lot over the years. Always seemed to be the starter that got the short end of the stick, or the guy who had to come out of the bullpen on no rest, or whatever. Stuck it out.
My immediate reaction to this is: Another move must be coming. You don't enter the offseason hunting starting pitching and trade one away unless you're pretty confident you can get another one.
Mike Rizzo and I define “imminent” differently.
Trading Roark means Nats need another proven starter. Now, they can try to find one for less than $10 mil, maybe get more control or younger.

Jefry Rodriguez is also in the Gomes deal, as @hoynsie said, according to person familiar.
Can confirm the package for Gomes is based around Daniel Johnson, a minor league outfielder, as others have said.
Gomes talks are serious. Does not sound like any of the big-name prospects are involved, at least not at last check. Could happen tonight.
Deal with Solis is $850,000 according to person familiar with it, which is $50,000 less than MLB Trade Rumors projected. In other words, pretty close.
Nats make it official. They’ve tendered deals to everyone, and come to terms with Solis, avoiding arbitration.
Can now confirm Nats will not only be tendering Solis, but coming to terms with him before tonight’s deadline. More to come. https://t.co/OQ9hv5MoVk
In other news, with less than three hours to go before the deadline, have not heard official word on who Nats will tender or non-tender. But got sense from person familiar that Solis was, as of an hour or so ago, likely to be tendered.
Suzuki (35) and Gomes (30) would be quite an offensive upgrade for Nats behind the plate. And though they’re older, both can play regularly enough to spell each other enough to stay healthy. Move makes a lot of sense, but again, word is the deal isn’t done.
A person close to the Gomes situation has heard what @Ken_Rosenthal and others reported: Nats are making a push for the catcher. What exactly that means right now isn’t clear, other than it’s not done.
All for second chances, and hope Addison Russell and everyone else who has to issue these kind of statements learns from those mistakes. But what about the people whose lives are ruined by their first chance? Not all mistakes are equal.

Sense from Suzuki: Rizzo wanted him on this team. Does not mean he’s a full-time starter. Means Nats saw him as a key piece.
Do the Nats need more help behind the plate? https://t.co/dZFTqQdBqy
Suzuki said Rizzo’s persistence in pursuing him was a big factor in his decision. Said he got the sense Nats would do “whatever it takes”

Suzuki will get $4M in 2019, $6M in 2020, according to a person familiar with the deal. @Ken_Rosenthal mentioned first, as is his way.
Kurt Suzuki is back. https://t.co/CSTlXUjPu4
This is interesting. https://t.co/QfP83cORPC
My main takeaway from Nats offseason so far: They’re not going to wait to see what happens with Harper.
Nats are jumping early this winter. Clearly not going to wait around to address needs. Have solidified bullpen, catching already.
Suzuki is a familiar face, beloved clubhouse figure who crushed the Nationals while with the Braves last year. Can start, or serve as a steady platoon option. https://t.co/8BWSArsrpQ
I believe @Feinsand mentioned first.
The Nationals have agreed to a two-year deal with catcher Kurt Suzuki, according to a person familiar. Pending physical.

Rizzo said the Nationals are hunting a “frontline catcher,” a guy who can catch 120 games or more. Continue to be interested in Realmuto, but “we’ve been talking about him for a year” and nothing has gotten done. Marlins asking price remains high.
Rizzo on whether they’re waiting for Harper’s situation to resolve itself: “He’s going to go about his business, and we’re going to go about ours.”
“I think Bryce is open to a lot of opportunities. He’s listened to a lot of things...I think he’s going to hear everything from every one.”
Boras is NOT revealing Harper’s destination. If that’s why you’re reading this.

Will be interesting to see where Miller ends up. Only GM job open right now is the Orioles. Plenty of front office spots to fill around the league though.
Miller, who was DBacks Director of Baseball Ops when they won '01 World Series, a VP for Reds, and Rizzo's right-hand man, has the kind of resume that should get offers. Would certainly be qualified for a GM job. https://t.co/SGCfx0ztWF
A forgotten note from yesterday: Rizzo described conversation with ownership over assistant GM Bob Miller's departure as "difficult" and "loud." Said he has been stumping for Miller with teams, and "anybody who asks, I tell them you'll be a better organization when you get him."
Does a hyphen have the power to change any sentence more than it does in the word re-signs?
The Nationals made Harper an offer of the biggest free agent deal in the history of the four major sports. What now, and why does it come with the sinking feeling that it’s still far too low? https://t.co/VP2uHUgrLB
@Rigel9000 I would take this blame if it meant no more weather-related questions
And now, a brain teaser: Which argument do you think Scott Boras will be making...? https://t.co/Gno0ewFVzG
You could argue this is exactly the kind of historic offer Harper should get. You could also argue it's ridiculous to think he would be less annually than Greinke. That will be the push-pull of Harper negotiations all off-season. https://t.co/dHrq6TMvVz
Highest AAV in baseball history: Greinke (34M), Price (31M), Kershaw (31M), Scherzer (30M). No position player has ever made more than 27.5M in a free agent deal (A-Rod, Cespedes).
My computer charger has been an early and unexpected casualty of the Bryce Harper free agency, the latest in a long line that includes my sanity, sleep schedule, and probably most of my non-baseball friendships.
Important on Harper: Both sides considered this a respectful offer. It wasn’t insulting. It was unprecedented.
Also keep in mind, this is $100 million (or more) below where Scott Boras will likely set his initial asking price. Harper is one of the youngest and most decorated free agents he will ever represent. He was always going to shoot high. https://t.co/W6FeyAqbwE
Keep in mind, this would be the biggest free agent deal by total money paid in the history of the four major sports. https://t.co/usq54BAvAt
Nationals’ offer to Bryce Harper was roughly $300 million for 10 years — so an AAV of $30 million — according to multiple people familiar with it. No opt outs.

Rosenthal said he started feeling so good over the summer that he entertained notions of trying to pitch in 2018, but ultimately stuck to the plan, which had always been to return for 2019.
Trevor Rosenthal said he had been in touch with former Cardinals pitching coach Derek Lilliquist throughout his rehab process. Says having a pre-existing relationship there will be an advantage as he gets started with Nats.

Bryce Harper will receive a qualifying offer today. This is not a surprise. This story explains why, and why (despite all our instincts to the contrary) you shouldn’t read much into it. https://t.co/nKsTssjWLg
For the record, I love Lost.
But after years of speculation about where he might end up, wouldn’t it be kind of boring if it were just over already? That’d be like if Lost just jumped to an ending without all the gratuitous stuff in the middle and didn’t waste all of our... wait a second. https://t.co/17lzeoKxlF
What to make of this: the Nationals and Harper did not come to a deal when they had exclusive negotiating rights, which never seemed likely anyway given Boras’s track record of testing the market. Doesn’t mean he won’t stay. Doesn’t mean he won’t go. Just means it’s not over. https://t.co/dEtka2C5fJ
This is a no-brainer. Also, he will reject this offer, according to common sense of all people even remotely familiar with baseball situations. https://t.co/dEtka2C5fJ
The Nationals will make Bryce Harper a qualifying offer today, according to a person familiar with the situation. He then has 10 days to accept or reject one year at $17.9M.
Making Harper a QO wouldn’t mean anything other than Nats believe there’s some chance at all he will go elsewhere. Otherwise, nothing to read into there. https://t.co/Yb1sjegDJi
Today is the deadline for teams to make their qualifying offers to players. Nats only have one real candidate, and that’s Harper.
Jhonatan Solano, who has been in the organization for years, elected free agency after his contract was assigned to Class AAA Fresno.
This is not this hard. https://t.co/EGiOwq0QJd
Nats saw Rosenthal touch 99 when they saw him throw this fall. Encouraged with it. Just a classic Nats signing all around.
Deal guarantees Rosenthal at least $7M next year, according to person familiar.
Rosenthal makes so much sense. If he’s good, you’ve got a set-up man. If he’s decent, you’ve got a hard-throwing middle reliever. Either way, you’re not paying top dollar (tho terms not available yet) on a guy with legit closer potential.
Nats buying low on a former closer and Boras client. This is kind of a no-brainer. https://t.co/XhhCbVAc8F

Is Bryce Harper in the Nationals’ plans...? https://t.co/Xuw3dAhblC
The Nationals’ season came to an end Sunday, leaving them well-aware something must change. https://t.co/iMdmn4oLJd

Harper on Rendon: "He deserves a Brinks truck, if I can say"
The Nationals fall, 12-0. They finish the season 82-80, their worst record since 2011. The Bryce Harper era might be over.
Harper lines one over first and into the right field corner. He's got a double.
Here comes Bryce Harper. Perhaps his last Nationals at-bat (again).
No one has done that against the Nats before. https://t.co/KzpYt4hpDb
Charlie Blackmon has hit for the cycle.
Blackmon sends one up the right field line. It's 10-0.
Now McGowin walks Holliday. Top of the order due for the Rockies, who are in a great position to add if they feel the need.
Ianetta doubles to start the bottom of the eighth.
Kyle McGowin will pitch the eighth.
Nothing for the Nats in the top of the eighth, but Harper will get to bat again.
That'll be it for Anderson, who held the Nationals to 4 hits in 7 2/3.
Reynolds walked and Sanchez singles and the Nats have two on with no one out in the eighth.
A "Beat LA" chant has spread around Coors Field.
RT @jorgecastillo: Game 163 will be tomorrow at Dodger Stadium. First pitch at 1:09 p.m. It'll be on ESPN.
Arenado hits his second homer of the afternoon, then Story follows with one of his own. Rockies 9, Nats 0.
Nothing for the Nationals in the top of the seventh. They trail 7-0.
Wow, Harper thought that was ball four. Not happy with the calls in that AB, gets called out on strikes. That could be his final at-bat as a National.
Dahl hits a three-run shot. It's 7-0.
Sanchez rushes his throw and can't get Blackmon, who has a base hit to start the fifth.
Fedde is done after four innings. He allowed four runs on five hits. He'll finish with a 5.54 ERA.
Fedde through three on 46 pitches, trailing 4-0.
Blackmon homers. 4-0 Rockies.
Fedde allows an 0-2 single to his Rockies counterpart, Anderson, to start the third.
Fedde through two on 31 pitches. Rockies lead, 2-0.
Sanchez lines into a double play. Nothing for the Nationals in the second.
Rendon and Soto draw back-to-back walks to start the second.
After an inning, Rockies 2, Nats 0.
Arenado gets a hanging slider and it's 2-0.
Fedde got LeMahieu to ground out and Dahl to strike out and now gets Arenado with two down.
Blackmon triples to start the bottom of the first.
Anderson catches Robles off first, and they get him at second. So that's that.
Pretty cool they let @FightinHydrant borrow the Dinger suit for a day! https://t.co/RRIFhQM7JZ
Robles hits the first pitch up the middle for a leadoff single.
Robles steps in and off we go for 162. Wow.
Rizzo on Harper:  "I think he's aware not only of my interest in him, his career and his life, but also ownership's and the organization's."
And now, the greatest mystery of this Nationals season unraveled: Joaquin Benoit's injury never got better, and he decided against surgery.
Asked if Harper is in the Nationals plans, Rizzo said “of course he’s in our plans.”
Rizzo said he expects Davey and the entire coaching staff back next year.
Dave Martinez said he anticipates his coaching staff will be back next season. “I want them all back.”

Will Stephen Strasburg ever be the same? https://t.co/t28T54VEBc
It’ll be Fedde, not Scherzer for the finale. https://t.co/kJYigmOdzE
RT @PostSports: This game means nothing for the Nationals (ergo Fedde for Scherzer) but it greatly impacts the N.L. playoffs. https://t.co/…
Scherzer said it was Rizzo's call to sit him tomorrow. Said he was mentally ready to pitch, but completely understands.
The logic here was if either Dodgers or Rockies could be eliminated, Scherzer would pitch. Since they’re both in no matter what, Nats won’t take the chance. https://t.co/SI3x2kEBPm
Davey said Doolittle was fine. Just too many pitches.
Change of plans from the Nationals: Because both Dodgers and Rockies are in the playoffs, Max Scherzer will NOT pitch tomorrow, Davey said. Fedde will go.
Nats win 12-2. They will have a winning season.
I don't think Doolittle looked ok in that inning. And I think Davey might have noticed the same thing. He limped off the field. Just didn't look like himself, and was really battling to compose himself between pitches.
Doolittle must be arguing, but Williams is going to come in. https://t.co/a1hoE6eO0f
Doolittle walks another and Martinez is going to come talk to him.
Wow. Reynolds can't pick up the ground ball and the Rockies have two on with no one out in the ninth. That was weird.
Doolittle gets the ninth. Davey doesn't want any Coors Field craziness.
Turner singles. It's 12-2.
Robles walks on four pitches. Nats have two on and two out in the ninth.
Wieters out of the game after fouling one off himself. Meanwhile, Michael A. Taylor doubles and Robles will pinch hit with two out in the ninth.
Holland gets the eighth for the Nationals.
RT @AdamMcCalvy: Gio Gonzalez will start Sunday for the Brewers.
Taylor singles up the middle. Wieters scores. 9-2.
Taylor will pinch hit here. Bud Black will make a move.
Difo goes the other way with two strikes. Two runs score. 8-2.
Stevenson will pinch hit, so Strasburg is done after six innings, two runs, and seven strikeouts. Will finish the season with a 3.74 ERA, highest of his career.
Matt Wieters hits an infield single and it's up to Difo with two outs and the bases loaded in the seventh.
Strasburg gets Desmond to ground out to end the inning. He's at 103 pitches through six. Nats lead 6-2.
Now Story singles. Miller is warming.
Strasburg loses a change-up in on Story, but no intent there.
Yo @masnKolko so I spilled but it's fine and like two or three of the keys on your keyboard seem to still work so we're good!
Strasburg through five on 85 pitches. Nats lead 6-1.
Juan Soto just homered. His 22nd. Nats 6, Rockies 1. Ties Harper for second-most homers by a teenager in baseball history.
Harper tries to tag from first on Rendon's fly ball. He's out.
Harper makes a nice leaping grab at the wall in center and we're through two already! Nats 5, Rockies 1.
Call overturned. He's out.
I very much respect the Coors Field DJ playing "Let it Be" while hoping a call is not reversed. This is clever.
Stras thinks he got the runner at first and so does Reynolds. Davey will challenge.
Rockies will pinch hit for Gray here in the second.
He walks him on four pitches.
Strasburg comes up and in on Desmond, who looks out at him. Desmond said something, and Strasburg shook his head back. That was weird.
Gonzalez hits Strasburg's first pitch -- a fastball at 92 -- out to dead center. 5-1.
Now Desmond throws the ball away trying to get it to Gray and Harper is on second with one out. Rockies fans are not happy.
Trea Turner. Two-run shot. His 19th. It's 5-0.
Eaton delivers a single to right and Difo scores. Nats 3, Rockies 0.
Desmond just tried to hidden-ball Difo after a throw-over at first. Didn't stick to it long enough to make it happen, and I'm sure Bogar had noticed anyway.
Strasburg needs 26 pitches but tosses a scoreless first.
Juan Soto probably needs an oxygen tank right now. He just ran like three miles to get to that ball, but he does. Two out. Strasburg at 22 pitches already.
Dahl misreads Sotoo's line drive and he has a two-out double that puts the Nats up 2-0.
Eaton hits one back off Gray and it goes up the middle. Bud Black comes out to check.
Max Scherzer will start tomorrow.
Dodgers are up four in the ninth. Looks like we'll see Scherzer tomorrow.
Davey is meeting with all his players individually before they go their separate ways tomorrow. Wanted to provide them all with things to improve on and feedback about the season.
Victor Robles will play winter ball in the Dominican, Martinez said.
Martinez said he wants Zimmerman to play in more spring training games next year, but was clear that they “will be smart.” https://t.co/OIFltnoHtz
Davey said they’re going to shut Zimmerman down. No need to push it .
No Zim for game 161. https://t.co/VspGXzgJkL

Harper strikes out looking to end the game. Nats fall, 5-2.
Last chance for the Nats now against Wade Davis.
As @MarkZuckerman just pointed out, the Nationals clinched second in the National League East because the Phillies lost again.
Nothing for the Nationals in the top of the eighth. Suero will get the ninth.
Cordero works a scoreless seventh. To the eighth we go, Nats trailing 5-2.
Nothing for the Nats in the top of the seventh. Jimmy Cordero will get the bottom of the inning.
It is 42 degrees here. It is supposed to be 90 tomorrow. Also, Rendon just doubled.
Dahl homers, and Davey will come get Solis.
Solis will start the sixth.
Robles doubles with two out in the sixth.
Ross is done. Taylor will pinch hit.
Ross at 80 pitches through five. Nats trail 4-2.
Now Ianetta absolutely crushes one to center. It's 4-2.
Desmond hits a two-run shot to right center. Rockies lead 3-2.
Trea Turner has a triple, and goodness gracious is there room in this outfield. Nats lead, 2-1.
Kieboom is 2 for 2 now, too.
Sanchez is 2 for 2. He's a beast right now.
Ross is through three on 54 pitches. Rockies lead 1-0.
Blackmon gets the scoring started with a home run to right. 1-0 Rockies.
Reynolds strikes out to end the inning.
Soto walks, so Reynolds will get a chance with the bases loaded and two out.
He's safe. Nats have two in scoring position with two out for Soto.
With the runners going, Rendon swings through strike three. Robles called out at third, but he disagrees and he's just going to stay there for now. Nats will challenge.
Harper is 2 for 2 with two opposite-field hits. Nats have two on and one out again.
Robles is limping after beating out that infield hit. But I guess he's staying.
Ross gets Desmond to ground back to him and into an inning-ending double play.
Now Ross walks Story, which means the Rockies have two on and no one out in the second inning.
Arenado starts the second with a double.
Ross hits into an inning-ending DP. Nothing for the Nats in the second.
Reynolds singles with one out in the second, then Sanchez sends one up the middle. Nats threatening.
Soto hits one to deep left, but it falls just at the track. A good AB against Freeland, a tough lefty.
Ross works a scoreless first. 18 pitches.
@MarkZuckerman @dougherty_jesse I stand by it
Robles lines out to Arenado to start the game.
Robles is in there, and off we go. It's freezing.
Scott Boras and Co. are in town for the final series.
Zimmerman said he doesn’t know if he will play again this year, but if back is bad he won’t risk injuring it worse and turning his offseason into rehab.
Scherzer said he thought he would be shut down, was surprised Nats wanted him to pitch. Admitted it’s a little challenging, but if it’s a playoff atmosphere, he’s in. https://t.co/yarZjISqJd
Scherzer said he wanted to leave the decision to pitch Sunday up to the Nationals. Rizzo, Martinez, and Lilliquist agreed he would pitch if it’s an elimination game for someone.
@DougalsBeard @Doc_Driver @BetCDriver @masnKolko I had the same problem for awhile. Was quite a shock for me, too.
Welcome to Coors Field, where I’m doing just fine thanks. https://t.co/Bs9PJSM08p
Martinez had said he hoped Zimmerman would be ok to play today, but he is not in there. Left Wednesday's game with back tightness.
Nats today: Robles CF, Turner SS, Harper RF, Rendon 3B, Soto LF, Reynolds 1B, Sanchez 2B, Kieboom C, Ross P
@Doc_Driver @BetCDriver @masnKolko ugh, they ignored my email
Stephen Strasburg is listed as the Nats’ starter for tomorrow. TBA has the finale. Scherzer on turn, but Martinez said it’s up to him.
Next time it’s the fifth inning and a manager is matching up I’m just gonna tell “two hour rule,” slam my pen on the table and run away.
This is worse than the Sopranos finale... #twohourrule
@jaboch I addressed one-run games in there directly, and used the statistics to show why so many of those games might have gone against them.
Nobody listened. https://t.co/78bjkdPIt7

Most poetically of all... the tarp is off now. It doesn't matter anymore.
Martinez said Tanner Roark will stay with his family for the rest of the year.
Zimmerman left the game with a tight back, Martinez said. They hope he can play Friday.
Harper on that sign across the way: “I think eight years is a little short.”
Harper: “I’m not very happy with the rain right now.”
Game called. Harper’s Home tenure ends... on deck.
Nevermind it's pouring again and there's lots of lightning around.
The rain has already lessened a bit, though it's definitely still falling.
I had this in the media predictions. https://t.co/1KIU99Rnpf
The tarp is coming out, which is good because I think Koda was about to start taking that personally. Frankly, I can't believe he hadn't already.
Koda is running onto the field, but no one else is running out there with him. I don't know why that is.
Oh my gosh, just as Turner grounds out and leaves him on deck... the rain starts. Can't make this up.
The seventh inning ends with Bryce Harper on deck.
Kieboom walks and Eaton will pinch hit. There is an apocalyptic, Winter-Is-Coming, the Death Eaters reign cloud sliding over the third base side of Nationals Park right now.
Eaton out on deck, so looks like Rodriguez is done. Glover warming.
Rodriguez gets the last out of the seventh. Nats lead 9-3 at the stretch.
Rodriguez hit 100 on that last pitch, but velo has never been the road block. That 97 mph fastball ends up out in the left field stands. It's 9-3.
Rodriguez is in a two-on, no-out jam in the seventh.
The sixth inning comes to an end. The Nats thank the grounds crew as they rake the field...and as the clouds keep threatening. They really have worked some miracles this year, without the aid of open flames.
Soto runs through Bogar telling him to stay and then gets to second anyway. Gets up smiling. Double.
The sign on the building across the way has changed to "8 More Years of 34!"
Suero strikes out three straight to end the inning. Midway through the sixth, Nats lead 9-0...and the clouds are coming.
RT @AndrewSimonMLB: Most recent players age 21y, 130d or younger to have a game with at least 1 HR, 4 hits, 5 RBI:		-Victor Robles, today	-…
Robles homers. He's 4 for 4. Wow.
Grace puts a decent swing on it and hits one to left. Two out for Robles now.
Kieboom singles, and while Eaton had been on deck, Grace will pinch hit for himself here. I think Davey considered rushing Suero so he could pinch hit, but he's going to stay with Grace up 6-0.
Sanchez singles. Runners on the corners with one out in the sixth.
Wouldn’t be a home game without ‘em. https://t.co/UohUmLp27a
Reynolds hits one to short and Rojas can't handle it. He's at second with a double.
It's Mark Lerner's birthday, and he gets a shoutout on the video board. Also Sean Doolittle's and Dave Martinez's birthday.
Turnour is out giving an update to the umpires.
Grace gets them out of the inning. It's an official game now, which is good because the dark clouds are coming.
He will come out of the game. Gets a nice ovation from the crowd. Grace will replace him.
Lessard is looking at his finger, looks like maybe a blister.
McGowin is yanking his fastball and Lessard is going to come out and check on him with Martinez. All of a sudden just pulling everything glove side.
McGowin walks Bostick to start the fifth. Grace is warming.
Robles records his first career three-hit day. The torch is being... nevermind thought that was my Word document.
Robles has his third hit of the day.
McGowin through four scoreless on 57 pitches. They've gotta get through five.
Now McGowin walks O'Brien so he's in his first jam. The clouds are rolling in.
The no-hitter ends with Derek Dietrich's line drive to Harper.
Chen gets out of it. After three, Nats 5, Marlins 0.
Sanchez continues to hit left-handed pitching. He's got two hits in two at-bats today. Runners on the corners with no one out.
McGowin strikes out Sierra looking to end the third. He's through three scoreless and hasn't allowed a hit.
Woah, Reynolds takes over at first for Zimmerman. Has to be an injury. Otherwise you'd think Martinez would want him to get an ovation of some kind.

Wei-Yin Chen has slowed to whatever is just before a stop.
Turner walks. Here comes Harper again with no one out.
Robles fights one off up the first base line and he has a double and the Nats have a 5-0 lead.
McGowin gets a bunt down. Marlins have Sanchez caught between third and home. But Wallach overthrows third and the Nats score anyway. McGowin on second. Kieboom to third.
Kieboom sends a ground ball up the middle, just out of Riddle's reach. Nats lead 2-0.
Sanchez singled. Bases loaded with no one out for Kieboom.
Zimmerman draws a walk, so the Nats have two on with no one out in the second.
Soto drops a line-drive surprise bunt up the middle, over the pitcher's head, under the shortstop's glove, and somehow reaches. Unorthodox.
Kyle McGowin is through two scoreless innings on 23 pitches.
They cheered for a long time. https://t.co/ixWkcrN7r1
Crowd standing for Harper as he comes to home plate for the first time.
Robles leads off with a single to right.
Sanchez makes a diving stop to rob Dietrich of a hit and McGowin is through an 11-pitch scoreless first.
McGowin starts his afternoon by striking out JT Riddle and off we go.

Matt Wieters admitted he started trying to gameplan Scherzer to 300 when he was at 260 or so with time to get it.

Peter O'Brien greets Williams with a homer. It's 9-3.
Martinez will come get Collins and go to Williams as the righty O'Brien comes up.
Collins will start the eighth. Robles comes in. Stevenson stays in. Harper and Eaton sit. Sanchez takes over for Rendon.
Stevenson out on deck, so if this wasn't obvious, Scherzer is done for the evening.
Wieters singles. It's 7-1.
Zimmerman singles. It's 6-1.
Rendon doubles. Nats 4, Marlins 1. He's on fire.
Since we're all wondering, the all-time record for strikeouts in a season is 513 by 1886 star Matt Kilroy, so Max is gonna need that start in Colorado.
Marlins walk Harper, so the Nationals have runners on the corners with one out.
Scherzer gets 300. Everybody stands. The bullpen stands. The dugout comes to the top step. He even acknowledged the crowd. Special moment in a year that needs a few.
1.
Scherzer will hit for himself here, of course.
Scherzer through six on 84 pitches. Eight strikeouts. I would think Davey will have to pry the ball out of his hands tonight if he hasn't hit 300 yet.
Rendon makes a great diving stop to prevent O'Brien from getting extra bases, but can't get the throw off in time. Base hit. Still two down in the sixth.
2. https://t.co/AgmreVSVtD
Nats can't add. They're 1 for 11 with RISP.
Rendon is now hitting .311. Current NL batting leader Yelich is at .321.
Rendon rips another hit.
Harper walks again.
Scherzer is through five on 70 pitches. Seven strikeouts.
Ortega bloops a curve into left and that brings Scherzer back to the top of the Marlins order with two out in the fifth.
Ortega will pinch hit for Brigham with two out in the fifth.
3. https://t.co/pkLbML4YRz
Wieters doubles to start the fourth. Nats need to start doing something with their baserunners here to give Scherzer some cushion.
4. He's at six strikeouts through four innings. Very reasonable 56 pitches. https://t.co/o78aXVFZ4I
Anderson bloops a curve info left and gets an RBI double out of it. 3-1.
5. https://t.co/6185MEFVhg
Rojas singles to left center for the Marlins first hit, so no no-hitter tonight for Scherzer.
Zimmerman gets caught looking at a curve. To the fourth we go, Nats 3, Marlins 0. (Scherzer 4 of 10)
Soto hits into a DP. Runner at third with two out for Zimmerman.
Brigham hits Rendon, so Soto gets a chance with two on and no one out.
Harper rips one to right center and slides in with a double to start the bottom of the third.
6. https://t.co/4mQDFKir9P
@MarkZuckerman It's Cranberry Sauce you fools! But about that moon landing...
Brigham bunts, which costs Scherzer a strikeout chance and gives the Marlins a runner in scoring position with two out.
Change gets away from Scherzer, who was on the bases for the whole last half inning. Hits Dean. Marlins first runner against him.
As they are an answer to one of the trivia questions on the video board I feel like this is a good time to share the revelation I had earlier this week -- and guys, this is BIG: BEATles. Not beetles. Like BEAT. Like music has a BEAT. BEATLES.
Wow, Turner hits into an inning-ending DP. Nats 3, Marlins 0 after two.
Eaton walks to load the bases. One out for Turner. Time for a #moundvisit.
Woah, Scherzer is now 42nd on the all-time strikeout list with 2,442. So much 42!
Scherzer bunts. Marlins get the lead run at third, but throw the return to first away so it sort of works anyway. Scherzer on second with one out. Difo at third.
Now Difo walks so Silver Slugger candidate Max Scherzer is up with two on and no out.
Wieters singles to start the bottom of the second.
7. https://t.co/aphvVwvTfI
8. https://t.co/ocT51F6sC2
Bryce Harper has now scored 100 runs this season, by the way.
Rendon turns on one. No-doubter to left. 3-0 Nationals. His 24th. He's got 90 RBI and he missed a month with that broken toe.
Harper walks. He's got 130 hits, 127 walks.
Eaton steals second, but the Marlins might take a look.
Eaton draws a walk to lead things off for the Nationals.
12-pitch scoreless first from Scherzer. One strikeout.
Those balls always come back to the infield. Not sure if Zimmerman was worried about the runner there, but normally that should be his.
Wow, Wieters drops that pop-up, which fortunately he touched in foul territory apparently.
9. That took three pitches. https://t.co/D5E9K5VMHq
Scherzer is 10 strikeouts from 300. Off we go.

The Mets will pinch hit for Matz in the top of the fourth.
Frazier lines one to the gap in right center and Fedde has to deal with another leadoff man on base.

Harper doubles. He has tied his career high with 99 RBI. Nats lead 2-1.

Nothing for the Nats in the bottom of the first. Out comes the crew with some diamond dry. They're determined.

Harper walks. Nats have two on with one out in the first. Still raining.
Turner singles, and he's now reached base in 23 straight games.
Nats are honoring Mets PR legend Jay Horowitz with a cake for his last visit to Nationals Park.
Took 26 pitches but Fedde is through the first. Limited the damage. Turnour is out talking to the umps about the radar, which I'm sure will happen a lot here.
Fedde walks Nimmo to put two on with two out.
It's a testament to John Turnour and Co. that this field is even remotely playable after all this rain. But it's soggy, and you can't help but be a little nervous for everyone's health.
Bruce drives one to the track in left. Sac fly. 1-0 Mets.
Fedde throws a first-pitch curve which ends up being the perfect pitch to double steal with Rendon playing way off the line. Two in scoring position with one out.
Back-to-back hits for the Mets to start this one.
Rosario bloops one to left and this is going to be a messy one.
Fedde and the Nationals are on the field. It's raining. You're up to date.
You know this by now, but 2 pm start.

Nats win, 6-0. They one-hit the Mets. They also got officially eliminated. Weird sport. Weird year. Weird world.
Austen Williams will get the ninth in a 6-0 game.
Cordero works a scoreless eighth.
No regrets. https://t.co/7VkyjO5V4R
Cordero gets the eighth in a six-run game.
Harper has driven in 98 runs this season. His career high is 99.
Harper doubles up the right field line and the Nats' lead grows to six.
Trea Turner steals his 41st base. Has tied Ian Desmond for most total career stolen bases by a National.
I feel strongly about this and only have a week to make my case. I will rest it here for now. https://t.co/ZoryVGTf2B

Cordero is warming for the eighth with at least a five-run lead. Davey committed to getting the inexperienced relievers in positions they might need them next year. Why not?
This is the second time this year the Nats have played I Wanna Dance With Somebody at the seventh inning stretch. It should be the 77th time. #myopinion #butimright
Turner makes an outstanding, Jeterian play in the hole to end the seventh. At the stretch, Nats 5, Mets 0.
Matt Wieters hits a three-run homer. 5-0 Nationals in the sixth.
Mets intentionally walk Zim to get to Wieters with two on and two out.
Rendon doubles to left center. He's reached base in 30 straight games.
Harper comes up justttttt short with a deep drive to center that pushed Jackson to the wall.
Taylor pinch hits for Voth, whose day is done after five scoreless innings in which he allowed one hit.
Voth is through five scoreless innings. He's due up to start the fifth. Wouldn't be surprised if Davey pinch hits here, get him out while he feels good.
Nothing for the Nats in the fourth. To the fifth we go, Nats 2, Mets 0.
I think Difo might have missed a sign there. Zimmerman out by a few feet, running on a 1-1 pitch with two out.
Voth through four scoreless on 57 pitches. Nats lead 2-0.
That play shows you how much ground Robles can cover when he gets a good jump. He was in true left field, no problem.
Conforto ends Voth's no-hit bid with an infield single to lead off the fourth.
Trea Turner hits his 18th homer of the year. Nats 2, Mets 0.
Robles one-hops the left field wall. He thought he slid safely into third with a triple, but it hopped into the stands so he'll be on second for Turner.
Seven straight retired by Voth, who is through three scoreless innings on 44 pitches.
Voth works a 1-2-3 second inning. He's through two on 34 pitches.
Soto pops to right to end the first. Scoreless in a now-meaningless baseball game at Nationals Park.
The Cardinals just beat the Giants on Tyler O'Neill's walk-off homer. The Nationals are officially eliminated from playoff contention.
Turner turns on one and doubles into the left field corner. He's reached base in 22 straight games, a career high.
Robles strikes out looking to start this one. Sort of surprised that's happened to him a few times lately -- he tends toward the over-aggressive side.
Voth strikes out Frazier to end the first. He needed 22 pitches.
Back-to-back walks for Voth, who needs to live on control, and he's in some trouble in the first with Frazier due.
Voth gets Rosario to ground out to start the game. Meanwhile, Cardinals and Giants are in extras.
Adam LaRoche is here as part of Faith Day at Nationals Park.

Voth will start tomorrow, Davey said. Since Roark’s been home all week, they didn’t see a point in pushing him too hard. He will probably pitch Wednesday.
Nats fall 4-2. They're a .500 team on September 21.
Soto strikes out. Two down for Zimmerman, who also is the tying run.
Rendon singles. Nats get one back in the ninth. It's 4-2.
Harper hits one to deep left, but not quite deep enough. Falls just in front of the wall. One down.
He's chasing down Rendon. He's reached base in 21 games, tying a career high. https://t.co/JKjQOQ1Rhx
Turner starts the ninth with a double to the gap in right center.
Williams throws a scoreless ninth. Turner, Harper, and Rendon will take their shot against Gsellman in the ninth.
Wow, Kieboom gets caught in-between there and the Mets turn an inning-ending DP. To the ninth we go. Williams will pitch the top of the inning.
Kieboom reaches and Stevenson singles and the Nats have two on with one out in the eighth. They have the tying run at the plate in Victor Robles.
Cordero works a scoreless eighth. Nats will face Lugo in the bottom of the inning.
Mets will pinch hit for DeGrom who went seven innings and allowed one run on three hits. Struck out eight.
@FightinHydrant @misteryork1 Yup my bad on that one
After seven, Nats trail 4-1.
Easy sixth for DeGrom, who has yet to break 90 pitches. Nats trail 4-1. Collins will take over for the seventh. Ross allowed three earned runs in eight hits in six innings.
Ross has settled down nicely here. He's through six on 95 pitches. Getting more groundballs lately, which is what he should be getting.
Kieboom singles with two out in the fifth. Ross will hit for himself.
Ross at 78 pitches through five innings, and the Nats trail DeGrom 4-1.
A quick fourth for Ross, who's at 65 pitches and trailing 4-1.
@CespedesBBQ No one should need to ask why.
Nothing for the Nats in the bottom of the third. They trail 4-1. DeGrom has allowed four runs in a start one time this year.
Robles singles through the left side with two out in the third.
Now Mesoraco bloops one just inside the line in left. Smith scores, but a Soto-to-Turner-to-Kieboom relay gets Frazier. It's 4-1.
Now Rendon misplays a hard ground ball his way. Error. Defense hasn't helped Ross much, either.
Delayed reaction, but it's 3-1 Mets now. Lot of line drives off Ross. Velo is good, contact is, too.
Bruce doubles. 2-1 Mets.
Conforto doubles to the gap in left center, just over Soto's leaping reach. Ross has another runner in scoring position to deal with.
DeGrom picks off Difo and the inning ends. They tie it, which is no small feat against DeGrom.
Zimmerman hits a sac fly to center. Tied at one.
Soto turns on 98 and ropes it into right for a single. Runners on the corners and no one out.
Rendon draws a walk. He's reached base in 29 straight games.
Ross gets through the second without letting the run score. He's at 37 pitches.
Ross's fastball takes off on Kieboom and the runner moves to third with two out.
Mesoraco slides one up the third base line and the Mets have another runner in scoring position.
Ross is through the first on 22 pitches. Nats trail DeGrom and the Mets 1-0.
Oh, ok. It was originally not a HBP. Mets challenged. Now it's HBP.
Nevermind, he hit him. That was hard to see. They're reviewing it. https://t.co/zhKwVD1eiM
Now Ross walks Nimmo, so he's got two on and two out.
Bruce bloops one into short left and the Mets have an early lead.
Seems like he came in too hard on that ball. https://t.co/j8LxC4tHU0
Woah, Robles seems to misread that ball and it goes to the wall for a double. That was odd. He was right on it then...not.
If the Nationals lose and the Braves win tonight, the Nationals are eliminated from playoff contention.
A reminder for those who aren't doing anything tomorrow morning... https://t.co/pRqXfR3dVN
Martinez said he will know after the game whether Roark will start tomorrow. He is back with the team after spending the week in Atlanta with his wife awaiting the birth of their third child.
Eaton’s left knee (the bad one) is aching so that’s why he’s been out for a few days.
Harper had left the clubhouse before we got there, but Martinez just kept saying "he was walking away." 		"I asked [Reyburn] why and he said he said some words...I don’t think he showed him up at all, I really don’t, and D.J. thought he did.”
@rdetchon he'd already run
Also this, sorry. https://t.co/zldZ3NIMCr
It's 5-4. It's been a long day. https://t.co/dVOkjpQs9I
They are any combination of two Braves wins and Nats losses from being officially eliminated. https://t.co/dVOkjpQs9I
Nats fall, 4-2.
Harper strikes out looking. He's still mulling that one over at home plate. He gets ejected and now he's in Reyburn's face. Martinez is holding him back.
Turner, Harper, Rendon trailing 5-4 in the 12th.
Jose Lobaton hits a fly ball to center and the Mets take a lead with two outs in the 12th.
Nats will intentionally walk Conforto. Two on, one out for Bruce.
McNeil bunts him to second this time without as much adventure. Conforto now with one down in the 12th.
Rosario singles up the middle.
Jefry Rodriguez gets the 12th.
Robles looks at strike three, right there. To the 12th we go.
Difo takes second, which doesn't really matter but he's there.
Reynolds strikes out on three pitches. Have to put it in play. You just have to.
They'll walk Difo to get to Reynolds.
Zimmerman tags to third. They can score him on an out.
Zimmerman hits one to the gap in left center and the Nats have the winning run at second with no one out. Gotta get him in now somehow.
Glover gets out of it. Still tied heading to the bottom of the 11th.
Plawecki lines out to short. Jackson will try to put the Mets ahead with the go-ahead run at second with two out.
Braves opening up a lead over the Phillies late. Coming into tonight, Nats' elimination number was four (sum of their losses, Braves wins)
Now Martinez will come get Collins and bring in Glover.
Reyes pops up his bunt back to Collins. One out.
Nimmo starts the 11th with a double to right center.
Collins will start the 11th.
Soto grounds out. We go to the 11th.
Rendon walks.
Call overturned. Harper is out. Two down and no one on in the 10th.
Throw beat Harper, but I think the tag missed him. Rosario seems pretty certain it didn't. They'll challenge.
Harper beats out an infield single with one out in the tenth. Winning run is on.
AND if he had given up a run, would that be Martinez's fault for staying with him or (GASP), Holland's fault for walking two hitters in a tie game? https://t.co/RMCmB53Vjq
So to the man yelling loudly at Martinez from the upper deck (and all of you): Was staying with Holland when he struggled to start that inning the right decision because it worked, the right decision either way, the wrong decision that worked, or the wrong decision either way?
Holland gets the 1-2-3 DP to end the inning. Mets don't score.
Holland walks Bruce on four pitches. Bases loaded for Reinheimer.
Holland walks Conforto. Two on with one out for Bruce.
Now McNeil half swings through a pitch in the dirt so at least it was all worth it.
He pointed and waved his hand in D.J. Reyburn's face. That should cost him the game. Maybe even a set. https://t.co/jtKPrZmHmf
Callaway gets ejected after McNeil thought he didn't go around there.
Rosario starts the 10th with a single through the left side.
Nothing for the Nats in the bottom of the ninth. To the tenth we go. Holland coming in.
Wilmer is Difo-ying physics with these swings. Holy moly.
Nope. Eaton will hit second not Reynolds. I got faked out.
It'll be Difo, Reynolds, Robles
Doolittle strikes out two in a scoreless ninth. To the bottom of the ninth we go.
Wieters pops out to end the inning. Nats tie it. Doolittle will get the ninth.
Zimmerman beats out an infield hit and the Nationals have runners on the corners with two out for Wieters.
Soto breaks out of the slump with a double that ties the game.
Rendon gets one run in with a ground ball to third. 4-3 now. Soto with two down and the tying run at second.
I don't know what it says about our society that Gsellman taking the bullpen cart united this stadium in applause -- including the decently large group of Mets fans -- like nothing else has tonight. https://t.co/Lf2bNYn0iM
Gsellman is taking the bullpen cart, which makes him the first visiting player to do that here, I think.
Mets will change pitchers again. They'll go to Gsellman now with runners on the corners and one out.
Harper hits one to the wall in right. Wow. Justtt missed it. Needless to say that lede was already written during the pitching change.
Nats have two on and no one out for Harper, Rendon, Soto. Trailing 4-2.
Robles starts the eighth with a single.
Suero strikes out two to end the eighth. Nats trail 4-2.
Martinez will go get Grace and bring in Suero now.
Bruce singles and that brings home a run. 4-2.
McNeil leads off the eighth with a triple into the right field corner.
Grace relieves Scherzer in the eighth.
Taylor goes and Plawecki gets him to end the inning. Nats trail 3-2 heading to the eighth. That eliminates Scherzer's chance at 20 wins, for what that's worth.
Scherzer is done. Seven innings. Five hits. Three runs. 13 strikeouts.
Scherzer has 13 strikeouts through seven innings. He's thrown 104 pitches.
Scherzer is now at 290 strikeouts. Only people to get 300 since 1990: Sale, Kershaw, Schilling, Johnson, Martinez.
13 strikeouts.
Strikeout No. 12 for Scherzer.
Scherzer will start the seventh at 96 pitches.
Mets will make a pitching change here.
Rendon homers. His 22nd, and 100th career homer.  3-2.
Scherzer strikes out Reyes. He's at 96 pitches through six.
Anybody got a blowtorch? https://t.co/pyMythJ2yn
WOW. Smith slides for a catch and just stops. Another divot. This turf is in terrible shape after all the rain. It's dangerous. Mets calling for somebody to come fix it.
Scherzer struck out 10 batters for the 81st time in his career, eighth all time.
Max Scherzer has struck out 285 batters this season, a new career high and new Nationals record.
Nothing for the Nationals in the fourth. To the fifth we go, Mets 3, Nats 0.
Soto has looked very off lately, and that swing was the worst one he's had in a long time. He's just caught in between. Rhythm isn't there.
Scherzer has tied his career high with 284 strikeouts. His career high is also the Nationals record.
Scherzer through four on 64 pitches. Seven K's. Nats trail, 3-0.
Harper does not tie the record for most consecutive walks. Instead, he grounds into a fielder's choice, which is allowed sometimes.
Scherzer at 52 pitches through three. Nats trail 3-0.
Wow, Scherzer allows back-to-back homers. 3-0.
Sorry, 2-0 obviously. https://t.co/33rjZyQShb
Conforto hits a 1-0 fastball out to left and the Mets have a 1-0 lead.
Scherzer strikes out to end the inning. Scoreless after one.
Sanchez reaches on a bobble by Rosario so the Nats have two on and two out for Scherzer.
Juan Soto has changed his walk-up song to "Suave."
Scherzer strikes out Plawecki to end the second. Back on track pitch count wise, at 31 through two.
Scherzer strikes out Nimmo on three pitches. First two fastballs he threw in that AB had more life than any he threw in that last outing, at least from here and on replay.
Bryce Harper has now walked in six straight plate appearances.
Now Scherzer walks Conforto.
Wow, the turf really pulled up under Sanchez there. They're going to have to come out and replace it. His leg got stuck.
Wow. Robles seemed to lose that ball at some point and it falls between everyone. Sanchez tripped on something. Double.
Yo @ByJamesWagner the people are clamoring for you!

Turner is fine after taking a pitch to the helmet. Said it didn’t hurt. Pointed out that it reminds you of “the battle you don’t always see” hitters go through, the need to stay in the box when pitches look close but might break late.
Nats win, 4-2: Doolittle gets his 25th save.
Reynolds pops to short. Doolittle will try to hold a two-run lead against the bottom of the Marlins order.
By the way, Harper's five walks are the most for any National Leaguer this season.
Reynolds will get a chance with two outs and runners on the corners.
Now Wieters walks. Nats have two on with one out for Difo. Doolittle warming.
Zimmerman delivers a one-out double off the wall in center. Nats have a chance to add.
Holland works a scoreless eighth. To the ninth we go, Nats 4, Marlins 2.
O'Brien checks his swing and hits a line drive up the middle.
Nats don't score in the top of the eighth. Holland will pitch the bottom of the inning.
Even after that first half, when he looked impatient and sometimes reached for pitches he doesn't when he's right, Harper is a walk away from tying his career high.
Harper walks. He's walked five times tonight.
Robles walks to start the top of the eighth.
Davey will pinch hit for Eaton against the lefty. Robles gets a shot.
Holland is warming for the eighth.
Grace and Miller combine to throw a 1-2-3 seventh. To the eighth we go, Nats leading 4-2.
Martinez pulls Grace and will call on Miller to get the righties here.
Matt Grace gets the seventh.
Stevenson pinch hits for Strasburg whose evening is over after six innings in which he allowed two runs on five hits, walked one, and struck out 11.
Strasburg's 101st pitch of the night ends a scoreless sixth. Nats lead 4-2.
That's 11 strikeouts for Strasburg, who ties a season high.
Soto is 0 for his last 8 with three strikeouts. Has looked a little in-between here in Miami.
Eaton singles,. Turner scores. Harper goes first-to-third. 4-2 Nationals.
Harper walks again. He has now walked four times tonight.
Turner, apparently feeling ok, immediately steals second. His 40th.
Even if no physical trouble results, that stuff can mess with hitters for awhile. https://t.co/mzCXSaVYaW
Kinley just hit Turner in the head. He's up. It hit his helmet. But that's not good. Lessard and Martinez walking him to first.
Strasburg will hit for himself in the top of the sixth. He has the bottom of the order coming up, and Martinez clearly wants squeeze another inning out of him.
Strasburg gets out of the fifth with a lead. He's at 90 pitches, leading 3-2.
Strasburg walks O'Brien again. He's now in a bases loaded situation with two out. Lilliquist out for a #moundvisit.
Realmuto bloops one to short right and the Marlins get a run back. It's 3-2.
Back-to-back hits for Riddle and Rojas and now Strasburg has to face Realmuto with two on and two out in the fifth.
Dean hits a fly ball to right to end the fourth. Strasburg gets out of trouble again. He's at 62 pitches through four, leading 3-1.
Eight straight outs recorded via strikeout.
Seven straight outs for Strasburg recorded via strikeout. A lot has happened between the K's, but they're accumulating. He's up to eight total.
Strasburg walks O'Brien and he's in a two-on, no-out jam.
Realmuto takes a two-strike fastball the other way and he's on to start the fourth.
Soto hits the ball hard to second, but Rojas handles it. Nats lead 3-1 in the fourth.
Someone just did the N-A-T-S Nats, Nats, Nats cheer in the stands here, so that was noticeable.
Rendon hits a fly ball to right and Eaton slides home safely. 3-1.
Nats get another bases loaded chance. They're 0 for 4 in these spots tonight so far.
Harper walks for the third time in four innings. He's three shy of his career high.
Eaton draws a one-out walk and he's reached three times in four innings.
Last six outs have come via strikeout for Strasburg. He's at 39 pitches through three. Nats lead 2-1.
This is now relevant, and I find it interesting. https://t.co/VXe5ftJV80
Marlins catch Difo trying to steal and the inning is over. Means Strasburg has to lead off the fourth, which isn't what the Nats would want there.
Strasburg strikes out three straight to end the second. He's at 25 pitches. Nats lead 2-1 after two.
Now Strasburg loses a fastball up and in and hits Anderson.
O'Brien gets a 2-0 pitch and drives it out to left. 2-1 Nationals.
Soto grounds out to end the inning. The Nats have left six but scored two. They lead 2-0.
Turner drops one down and evades a tag as Difo scores. The squeeze brings home another run. Nats 2, Marlins 0.
Eaton singles to bring home Wieters and the Nats lead 1-0. Eaton's 2 for 2 in two innings.
Strasburg gets the bunt down, so the Nats have two men in scoring position with one out.
Wieters walks and Difo singles and the Nats are threatening again.
Strasburg works a seven-pitch first. Scoreless after one.
Zimmerman pops out and the inning ends.
Soto strikes out on a half swing, which isn't like him. They're loaded with two out for Zimmerman.
Rendon's been on base in 27 straight games. https://t.co/jypd3p5xri
Rendon singles and the Nats have the bases loaded with one out for Soto.
Harper is five walks away from tying his career high.
Eaton starts the game with a single to left.

My Uber driver is watching a video of a cheetah catching a monkey on his phone while we are waiting for a drawbridge to come back down.
Robles said Davey and Kevin Long suggested something to him about opening up his front leg before tonight’s two-hit game. He will probably try it again.
Nats fall, 8-5. Bullpen struggled. Robles hit his first big league homer.
Nothing for the Nats in the top of the eighth. They trail 7-5.
The inning ends. Marlins lead, 7-5, heading to the eighth.
Sacrifice fly brings home another run. 7-5 Marlins.
Brinson sneaks one through the left side and the Marlins take a lead.
Now Lilliquist will come out for a #moundvisit.
He walks O'Brien to load the bases with no one out.
Now Glover is behind O'Brien 3-0. Looks a little out of sync mechanically right now.
Glover walks Realmuto and he's in a two-on, no-out jam.
Anderson leads off with a base hit through the left side.
Koda Glover gets the seventh.
Castro makes a ridiculous pick to rob Harper of a hit and we're at the stretch, tied at five.
He is. That was bold. Anyway, tie game.
OH, the Nats (!) are challenging that Robles was out at second base.
Wait, Mattingly signaled not to challenge, but now they're reviewing the call? I'm confused.
Nats tie the game because Trea Turner beats out a would-be double play ball. The speed between him and Robles is... woah.
Robles hits one up the middle for his second hit of the evening. Nats have runners on the corners with one out for Turner, then Harper.
Robles tracks down Suero's ground ball at the center field wall and that ends the inning. Nats trail 5-4 after six.
Umps say Suero balked. That brings a run home, and the Marlins have a lead.
Martinez will go get Cordero and bring in Wander Suero, who inherits runners at first and third with one out in a tie game.
Now Sierra sneaks one through the infield and the game is tied.
Three straight hits and the bases are loaded with one out for Sierra. Lilliquist will come out.
A bloop single and an infield hit have Cordero in a two-on, one-out jam in the sixth.
Jimmy Cordero will get the sixth.
Miller strikes out two to end the fifth. Nats 4, Marlins 2.
Fedde is done after 4 1/3 innings. His pitch count climbed quickly. Miller will relieve him.
Castro doubles. 4-2.
Big strikeout for Fedde, who gets Dietrich for the first out of the fifth. Action in the Nats bullpen as he's headed toward 100 pitches.
Fedde issues back-to-back walks to start the fifth and Lilliquist will come out for a #moundvisit. Dietrich will pinch hit for Richards.
Fedde through four scoreless on 71 pitches. Nats 4, Marlins 0.
Fedde through three scoreless on 56 pitches. Nats 4, Marlins 0.
Rendon homers. It's 4-0.
With Turner on first, Harper just bunted foul with two strikes, which was a weird strategy.
Robles hits one over the 427 sign in left center, his first career home run. Absolutely crushed.
Fedde works around the double for a scoreless second. He's at 34 pitches. Nats lead 1-0.
O'Brien doubles to start the second.
Fedde hits into an inning-ending double play. But the Nats score first and lead 1-0.
Anderson can't handle Kieboom's ground ball and the Nats get a run. Still loaded with one out for Fedde.
The Marlins will intentionally walk Wilmer Difo to get to Kieboom.
Zimmerman doubles and the Nationals have two men in scoring position with one out.
Rendon has this game's first hit, a single up the middle. He's reached base in 26 straight games.
Easy 1-2-3 first for Fedde on 14 pitches.
My excitement about the roof has been tempered by hearing a beer vendor yell "It's getting closer to last call" and the immediate existential crisis that followed when I realized there's a metaphor in there.
WOW Erick Fedde just saved his face with a great grab on a comebacker for the first out of the evening.
Nothing for the Nationals in the top of the first.
Robles hits a fly ball to right and we're under way under a roof that makes weather irrelevant and all of us saner and should be mandatory everywhere forever.

Swanson beats out a ground ball to the shortstop hole so he's on to start the seventh.
Suero will start the seventh.
Soto hits into a double play to end the top of the seventh.
*5 1/3 https://t.co/B0uBjFLNxK
Suero gets Duda swinging to end the inning. Good job by the bullpen to get Roark out of trouble. He goes 5 2/3 and allowed two runs.
Now Duda will hit for Flowers.
Suero will come on with Flowers due.
Collins strikes out Inciarte and Martinez will come get him.
Martinez is going to go out to the mound and single for a reliever here. Collins will take over.
Now Culberson singles. Runners on the corners.
Markakis hits a one-out double to give the Braves an RISP with one out in the sixth.
Robles is taking his AB here so he must be fine.
Robles gets a weird jump, then catches up to it and makes a great leaping catch at the center field wall. Roark is through five on 86 pitches.
Call stands. Braves lose their challenge. One out.
Braves will challenge. Even if overturned, still an impressive effort from Rendon.
Rendon just made an outstanding play to rob Tucker of a hit. Braves might challenge this one. Basically had to cover the whole left side and did.
Roark gets Swanson to pop out and end the fourth. He's at 74 pitches. Nats lead 5-2.
Flowers hits a 3-2 pitch out to left, so it's 5-2.

Harper walks again. Bases are loaded with one out for Rendon.

Kyle Wright takes over for Newcomb and walks Tanner Roark to start the fourth.
The Braves in-game entertainment guy is talking trash about the presidents' race and saying the Home Depot bucket could win it blind folded. This is September.
Roark gets out of trouble. He's at 47 pitches.
Roark walks Ruiz, so he's in some trouble in the third.
Swanson bloops one into shallow center and the Braves have a man on in the bottom of the third. They'll also hit for Newcomb, who lasts just three innings. 73 pitches.
Anthony Rendon. Two-run shot. His 20th. 5-0.
Harper draws a walk. He's seven away from tying his career high.
Roark through two scoreless on 23 pitches. Nats lead, 3-0.
Roark works a scoreless first on 14 pitches. Nats lead 3-0.

Sanchez pops out to end the inning, but the Nats work Newcomb for three runs and 30-plus pitches in the first.
Now Wieters singles. Five of the first seven Nationals hitters have reached against Newcomb.
Zimmerman gets the run home by grounding into a force out. Nats 3, Braves 0.
Soto singles. Rendon goes to third. Nats have runners on the corners with one out.
He's now three RBI away from 100, would be the first time in his career.

Harper seemed fine after rolling over his wrist. Martinez said they'll keep an eye on him tomorrow, but that Harper reported he was OK when he came off the field that inning.
Hellickson will get an MRI in DC, but he felt the same pain in the wrist as he did when he sprained it. He's pretty convinced he's done for the season.
What kind of player could Juan Soto become if he steals bases like that?		Difo, after a long pause: 		“Barry Bonds?”
Nationals win, 7-1.
Robles leaps against the wall to rob Markakis for the first out of the ninth.
Turner hits a fly ball to center to end the top of the ninth. Grace will get the bottom of the inning. No one's moving toward the tarp and I think everyone agrees that that is fine.
14 walks for the Nationals. They have tied the Expos for most in franchise history.
It's raining again. We are living in the upside down. https://t.co/GxV8QJGJRR
I think it stopped already. That was not ok.
It's raining. Out of nowhere. There's still blue sky around. NO. NOOOO.
Grace gets out of the inning. So Rodriguez threw 4 2/3 innings of scoreless ball. Walked three. No hits. 75 pitches.
Rodriguez did not allow a hit in 4 2/3 innings of relief.
Rodriguez might be hitting a wall here, walks two with two out in the eighth. Martinez will make a chance with Freeman due. Matt Grace coming in. He didn't wait for Davey to take the ball, so he started slow walking in so as not to make things awkward. #September

Soto reached on a fielder's choice and Reynolds doubled him home and the Nationals lead 7-1.
@MarkZuckerman BUT THE EXPOS WALKED 14 TIMES ONCE HOW COULD YOU FORGET THE EXPOS
ANOTHER scoreless inning from Rodriguez. To the eighth we go, Nats 6, Braves 1.
Nationals PR has just informed us that Soto is the youngest player since 1900 to steal three bases in a game. Rickey Henderson was 20 years, 241 days old when he did it.
...and drive in a run with a single up the middle.
Rodriguez will hit for himself in the seventh.
The Nationals have walked 12 times in 6 1/3 innings, a pace of play clinic.
Rodriguez has provided three innings of scoreless relief. Nats lead 5-1 heading to the seventh.
They'll walk Soto to get to Reynolds with the bases loaded and two down. He flies out to center. Nats 5, Braves 1.
Rendon hits a line drive to left that one-hops the left field fence. Nats lead 5-1.
Harper walks. Time for a #moundvisit as Rendon steps to the plate with two out and the bases loaded.
Turner walks, which means Harper will get a chance as the organist plays "Georgia on my Mind," a bold choice.
Eaton delivers, doubles into the right field corner to bring home Kieboom. 3-1 Nats.
Rodriguez gets down a perfect sac bunt, so the Nats have a runner in scoring position with two out for Eaton.
Or watched like a fourth of Return of the King! #Gandalfforever https://t.co/CDDDqas7KQ
Rodriguez works a scoreless fifth. To the sixth we go, Nats 2, Braves 1.
Soto draws a two-out walk, so he's been on all three times today. Time for a pitching change.
Rodriguez works a 1-2-3 fourth. Nats 2, Braves 1. Teheran is done, too. Freeman will pitch.
Jefry Rodriguez -- who relieved Hellickson when he pulled his hamstring here in June -- relieves him again.
Turner strikes out to end the inning. Nats lead 2-1.
Eaton draws a two-out walk and the Nationals take the lead.
Hellickson is done. Stevenson will pinch hit. Wow.
Wow, now Hellickson is headed to the dugout. Looks like he hurt his wrist on that swing, or at least something in that area. Right wrist was the one he sprained to go on the DL in the first place.
Now Kieboom walks so the bases are loaded for Hellickson.
Soto's third and fourth steals of the season in this inning.
Runners go, and they're safe. Double steal puts two men in scoring position with one out for Kieboom.
Difo draws a walk so the Nats have two on for Kieboom.
Soto steals second base, so he's in scoring position with one out.
Hellickson at 60 pitches through three. Braves and Nats tied at 1.
Like THIS IS ALL I HAD LEFT. https://t.co/9YT82kPDlq
Simba Cam here has been privatized by Chick Fil A into "Little Nugget Cam" and this is disappointing on every. single. level.
Harper draws a two-out walk, his second BB of the game. Cannot blame Teheran for staying away, given their HR-laden history.
Harper is out on deck, so he must be feeling fine. Practice swings look normal.
Harper looks just fine chasing down Teheran's line drive. Scoreless second for Hellickson. He's thrown 44 pitches through two.
He's up. Martinez is waiting at attention to see if he needs to go out there. He rolled over his wrist weird, but for now, he's staying. https://t.co/iQML09zFaq
Harper takes a strange tumble reaching for Suzuki's line drive, and he is down. Sheesh.  I think he landed weird on his wrist.
Nothing for the Nationals in the top of the second. It's 1-1.
As promised, the Braves' organist plays "All I Want For Christmas Is My Two Front Teeth" when Spencer Kieboom steps in for the first time.
Hellickson through the first on 16 pitches. Run scored because of the error, so it's unearned.
Freeman hits a sacrifice fly to center and the Braves tie it.
Hellickson tries to pick off Acuna and the throw gets away so he's on third.
Shift hurts Hellickson there as a weak ground ball from Acuna Jr. becomes a hit. Easy out if they're positioned normally.
Reynolds pops out to end the inning. Nats lead 1-0.
Soto steals second, so the Nats have two in scoring position with two out for Reynolds.
Soto singles up the middle. 1-0 Nationals.
Harper walks, Rendon singles, and the Nats have two on for Juan Soto.
Call stands. Turner is out.
Martinez will challenge.
Turner swipes second, but they say he came off the bag again. He's frustrated. We'll see if they challenge.
A little "Go Cubs Go" action on the organ for Bryce Harper's first at-bat. Which is really upsetting because I JUST got that out of my head from when we went there in August.

Scherzer said he is ok, just never found rhythm. Got in stretch early and couldn’t use the windup to get his mechanics locked in.
Harper said he’s made a point of trying not to get tossed this year. Was clear he felt Diaz was out of line in what he said to him at the plate. Davey went out to argue for him, thought he would get tossed, ultimately decided not to because at that point, Nats were still in game.

Solis hits Freeman with his first pitch and the Braves have the bases loaded with no one out.

Jimmy Cordero will pitch the eighth.
Turner hits a fly ball to right to end the inning. Nats trail 7-5.

Eaton walks. Bases loaded with two out for Turner.
Reynolds JUST misses tying this game. Instead, Nats have two men in scoring position with two out for Eaton.
Brach hits Wieters, so the Nats bring the tying run to the plate in the form of Wilmer Difo. Reynolds on deck to pinch hit for Voth.
Voth works a 1-2-3 seventh.

Harper is frustrated with Diaz, who was already frustrated with him, but I think Harper had a point on that one. Wow.
Turner hits a one-out double and the Nats have two on with one out. Pitching change time.
Inning over. Nats trail 7-4 heading to the seventh.
Culberson hits a chopper that tips off Collins's glove and becomes a base hit. Not sure if Turner gets the out if Collins doesn't tip it. 7-4.
Collins walks Markakis to load the bases. Martinez will stick with him to face Culberson.
Martinez will bring in Collins to face Markakis. Wants to keep this close.
Albies golfs one into short left for a two-out double and the Nats will intentionally walk Freeman to face Markakis with two out.
Williams strikes out Acuña Jr., which is quite an achievement tonight.
Williams will take the mound for a second inning.
Difo grounds out to end the inning. Nats still trail 6-4 in the sixth.
Robles is on deck to pinch hit for Williams should Difo reach.
Wieters walks, so the Nationals have two on and two out for Difo.
Gausman walks Zimmerman and he is done for the night.

Williams works a 1-2-3 fifth inning.
Diaz and Davey are yelling about something. Davey is heated.
Williams gets the fifth.
Scherzer is done. Four innings, six runs, seven hits, three walks. Least effective start of 2018. Never looked quite right.
Nats down in order in the fifth. Braves 6, Nats 4.
Scherzer is at 102 pitches through four innings. Nats trail 6-4. I would imagine he'll be done.
The last time Scherzer allowed more than four earned runs in a start was almost a year ago to the day -- September 13, 2017 -- against the Braves. He allowed seven.
Markakis singles home another run. 6-4.
Scherzer just threw a 91 mph fastball to Markakis. That's way below his norm.
Freeman hits a sac fly to center. Harper tries to throw all the way home instead of to second, so Albies moves up. 5-4 Braves.
Scherzer is at 89 pitches in the fourth. Not getting ahead. Looks drained. Unlike him all around.
Scherzer, by the way, has not allowed more than five earned runs in any start this season. He's got runners on the corners and one out for Freeman here.
He's a homer away from the cycle. https://t.co/dropmlik3A
Acuna Jr. triples. Harper slipped chasing that ball to the wall, but seems to be ok.
Scherzer has a slightly easier time with Gausman this time. Strikes him out to start the fourth, his sixth strikeout in 3 1/3 innings on a night he looks off.
Difo slides off third base tagging up on that fly ball and he's out. Inning over. Tie game, though.
Now Difo doubles. Tie game.
Now Zimmerman hits a squibber out in front of home plate and Gausman throws it away. He gets a hit, second on the error.
Juan Soto. Number 20. 4-3.
Scherzer at 72 pitches through three. Trails 4-2.
Flowers hits a ground ball that ticks off Rendon's glove as he dives. Both runs score. Braves lead 4-2.

Wow, Acuna Jr. bloops a slider into right for a two-run single. Tie game.
Scherzer seems to be having trouble gripping the ball because of all the sweat. Wieters out for a #moundvisit, which isn't a normal occurrence with Scherzer on the mound.
Scherzer walks him. Will face Acuna Jr. with the bases loaded.
Gausman making Scherzer work here. Pushed him to 3-2 and has fouled off two full-count fastballs.
Scherzer is sweating so hard the brim of his hat is dripping. It's toasty here.
Scherzer strikes out Flowers and Swanson and now needs only to get past Gausman to get out of another jam.
Braves have made a lot of hard contact against Scherzer early.

Difo hits a sac fly to left and the Nationals have a 2-0 lead. Productive outs abound.
Wieters grounds out to second, but it gets the run home. 1-0 Nationals.
Call overturned. Soto is safe at third.
Davey is going to challenge the call.
Zimmerman sends one into left and Acuna Jr. throws out Soto trying to go first to third. He hesitated, which made the difference.
RoY Watch Round I: Acuna 2B, Soto BB.
Scherzer holds the Braves down in the first. One strikeout.
Scherzer falls behind Acuna 2-0 and surrenders a leadoff double.

Stevenson will pinch hit for Glover here.
Suero continues to warm, so it looks like he'll get the ninth up four.
Oh my god. https://t.co/flgMnFHLjy
Glover works a scoreless eighth. Nats lead 5-1 heading to the ninth.

Suero is warming.
That was almost a DP  but Turner bobbled and Difo lobbed and they were lucky to get one out, frankly.
Glover walks Hoskins with one out in the eighth. Bautista will pinch hit.
Strasburg went seven innings. Allowed one run on five hits. Struck out nine, walked one. Very...Strasburgian, really.
Santana recovers from a tough hop to get Zimmerman to end the inning before another run can score. Glover will get the bottom of the eighth.
Rendon doubles to left center to give the Nats a one-out runner in the eighth.
Glover is throwing.
Action in the Nats bullpen now. They should have Glover and Doolittle available today, among others.
@twopookies Scraped. Very scraped.
Strasburg comes back from 3-0 to strike out Cozens to end the seventh. Wendelstedt calls him over for a chat after, but it looks fairly civil. He's at 101 pitches through seven. His best start since returning from the DL.
Crawford's bloop falls between Harper and Turner so the Phillies have a one-out base runner.
Eaton robs Herrera with a diving catch for the first out of the seventh.

Rios got his man so Kapler will come get him.
Strasburg through five on 68 pitches. Nats lead 4-1, and don't have to deal with Nola anymore.
Strasburg gets Bour swinging for the first out of the fifth.
Bour will pinch hit for Nola here with no one out in the fifth.
Now Strasburg hits Alfaro and Wieters gets the brunt of it -- ricocheted off the back of his head. Lessard out to see him, though he's waving him off.
Crawford hits one out to right. 4-1.
Strasburg hits into an inning-ending DP. He hustled down the line and nearly beat the throw.
Herrera JUST missed bringing that one back. https://t.co/ogInGihgtS
Zimmerman homers to dead center. 4-0.
Strasburg hits 95 as he strikes out Hoskins for the final out of the third. He's thrown 42 pitches in three scoreless. Leads, 3-0.
Strasburg works around two hits to throw a scoreless second. He's through two on 29 pitches. Nats 3, Phillies 0.
Cabrera provides the Phillies with their first hit of the night, a one-out single in the second.
Strasburg's velo was still 92-94 -- below his career norms, in keeping with where it's been since he got back from the DL. But he seems comfortable with it.
Strasburg works a perfect first on 12 pitches. Nats 3, Phillies 0.
The inning comes to an end, but if you had told the Nats they'd jump out to a 3-0 lead against Nola, I think they would have taken it. Strasburg to the mound now.
...and with that, it's time for a #moundvisit.
Zimmerman singles. Rendon scores. 3-0.
Now Rendon hits one hard to the gap in left center for a one-out double. Nats squaring Nola up right now.
Harper now has 94 RBI. Has never gotten 100.
Harper hits a two-run shot to right center. No doubt. 2-0 Nationals.
Turner nearly decapitates Nola with a single up the middle, and the Nats will not be no-hit tonight.
RT @PostSports: Jeremy Hellickson says he wants to start, but the Nationals have a surplus of young pitchers they want to see. So what does…

Good news for tomorrow’s make-up, and everyone in DC in general. https://t.co/huCtDcFYV6
Nothing crazy for the Nats tonight: Eaton RF, Turner SS, Harper CF, Rendon 3B, Soto LF, Zimmerman 1B, Wieters C, Difo 2B, Strasburg P.
Hellickson said he would rather start, but understands if he needs to come out of the bullpen tonight after the craziness of the last few days.
@FightinHydrant No you might be right! looks like it's not going to get that far inland until Sunday! Fingers crossed!
Nationals just activated Hellickson from the disabled list. Not sure how they’ll use him, but they could sure use some depth in the pen after yesterday, so that might be part of the thought process.

Final thought of the evening, a philosophical note from Greg Holland that seems widely applicable: “If you win today, enough, you’ll end up in a good spot in the end.”
Corny as it sounds, too late though it is, the Nationals found their grit. And that was never a given. https://t.co/oaWISM2WNZ
It didn’t rain.
They won. Gritty performance from Holland and the Nats in general. Sweep two doubleheaders in four days. Say what you want, be as disappointed as you want, but they have not quit.
Holland walks him on four pitches. Now faces Hernandez with two on and two out. He's gotta be exhausted. Nats just don't have other options. Can't go to Doo or Glover twice in the same day. Voth hasn't pitched in this type of situation.
Holland falls behind Knapp 3-0. No one warming. This is his inning to finish. Pesky Hernandez on deck.
Holland walks Cabrera, so the tying run is on with two out in the ninth. Knapp now. (I wish!)
Woah Holland just bounced one. He looks more annoyed than worried, so I guess we can be the same.
I meant 10th. I'm in denial. https://t.co/5q8AZOKutF
Holland has his fourth strikeout of the day. One out.
RT @matt_breen: Juan Soto just blowtorched the Phillies season.
Holland gets the ninth after pitching an inning in game one.
SO @dougherty_jesse just called that, for your records.
Juan Soto just did it again. Nats 7, Phillies 6. His second of the game. His 18th. That is incredible.
@PostSports @dougherty_jesse If that paper said "sanity" and was thrown into a paper shredder this would be even more accurate.
This is. WHAT? https://t.co/XjLZ0ywCtS
Extra innings. This game is going to extra innings.
Now they intentionally walk Santana to get to Bautista with the bases loaded.
I do not know what just happened, but Wander Suero lobbed a ball. I think he must have seen the runner going out of the corner of his eye and didn't want to balk? Or just said "we all need a laugh or two." Effective on both fronts.
Suero will face Santana, who is a switch-hitter, which I forgot.
If Grace hadn't touched that, it might have been a DP ball. As it is, Nats only get one. Martinez will come get him for Suero to face the righty.
Miller gets Hoskins to pop out. Crawford will pinch hit and Martinez will come get Miller. I think we'll see Grace.
Lilliquist heads out for a #moundvisit. Suero is warming.
Miller hits Hernandez. Two on, no one out for Hoskins.
Hernandez wearing out Miller with what will be at least a 13-pitch AB.
Justin Miller walks the leadoff man in the ninth. He threw two pitches in game 1, but it's still tough to warm up all over again.
To the ninth we go, tied at 6. Miller will get the ninth. Taylor in center. Harper to right.
Tie game. He walked in the tying run. Now it's Harper with the bases loaded.
That strike two call is a HUGE break for the Phillies. Wow. That was... wow.
Garcia will face Turner. He pitched in Game 1, too.
Eaton walks. Bases loaded for Trea Turner. Now, Kapler will come get Dominguez.
Stevenson hits a ground ball to shortstop and they bobble it. Base hit. 6-5.
Difo will run for Zimmerman.
Zimmerman hits a hard ground ball to third. Stays out of the DP, but Nats down to their last out. Stevenson with runners on the corners and two out.
Taylor will pinch run for Wieters. He's the tying run, and he's on with one out.
Wieters singles. It's 6-4.
Matt Wieters putting together a 10-pitch AB here. Zimmerman is on deck to hit for Sanchez.
Reynolds strikes out. One down, runners on the corners for Wieters.
The zoo noises are @masnKolko https://t.co/Mjp6v8Ce7p
The Nationals have the tying run at the plate in Mark Reynolds. Runners on the corners and no one out.

Bautista homers to left. 6-3.
Minus x. Go read a book or something https://t.co/RdqRNKQM33
Swear I typed 5-3. It’s obviously 5-3x https://t.co/ibF0S9T5hN
Harper grounds out so nothing matters and the Nats will have one more chance to tie this one. They're down 5-4. Looks like McGowin will get the bottom of the eighth.
Now the count is 1-1 anyway. No wasted energy in this sport.
Now Kapler is arguing, which tells me they must have changed the call to a ball. Kapler is pointing. He should get docked a game for that.
I think they called that a foul ball, and Harper is adamant he didn't hit it. So he isn't stepping in the box. Martinez is arguing now. Umps will convene.
Turner hits into his second DP of the day, which is surprising. Two out in the eighth for Harper. No one is warming so Dominguez will face him.
I take it back. I don't see a lefty warming yet. So maybe not. https://t.co/y3qQnJdmHL
Now Eaton draws a leadoff walk and Kapler will get the righty. He'll have to get a lefty for Harper probably. So here we go again.
Franco will walk back to the other side. He's limping pretty hard, but honestly, it seems that could have been so much worse.
Franco is up. Wow. That's scary stuff.
Wow, Maikel Franco just flipped over the fence and went hard into the camera well. Umpires calling for trainers. Wow.
That was a four minute, eight second review.
After that, call overturned. He violated the slide rule. Nats are out of the inning, and head to the eighth trailing 5-3.
This is the longest review in the history of mankind, unofficially.
Nats have a shot to turn two again, but the throw gets away from Reynolds. Two down.
Williams watches a sure-fire double play ball hop off his glove, so he's now in a two-on, one-out jam.
Hoskins hits a one-out single up the middle and he's got a three-hit evening.
Austen Williams gets the bottom of the seventh.
Robles strikes out to end the seventh. Nats trail 5-3.
Robles will pinch hit in the pitcher's spot with two out in the seventh.
Cordero gets Altherr to end the sixth. Nats trail 5-3 heading to the seventh.
Cordero will relieve Collins with one out in the sixth.
Oh man, Rendon pulls the half-Trea Turner jump throw and gets him at first. Rendon is laughing.
Word I'm getting now is that league has no current plans to move the make-up game Thursday or the Atlanta series based on the updated forecast. Obviously, that could change if the forecast changes again.
Rendon, who rarely shows up umpires, did so there as he was called out on a pitch he thought was down and out.
Collins gets them out of trouble. Nats head to the sixth trailing 5-3.
Martinez will come get Roark after 4 2/3 innings. Collins relieves him.
Now Santana doubles and the Phillies have batted around.
Ramos singles to put the Phillies up 5-3.
Action in the Nationals bullpen. Looks like Collins and a righty to be determined.
Now Lilliquist will head out for a #moundvisit.
Hoskins doubles to tie the game.
Hernandez singles. It's 3-2. Runners on the corners with two out for Hoskins.
Bour pops out. Two down.
Cabrera doubles, so it's 3-1. Kapler will now pinch hit for Arrieta with Bour.
Franco slices a first-pitch fastball through the left side, so the Phillies have runners on the corners with one out for pinch hitter Cabrera.
Nick Williams leads off the fifth with a double to right.
Juan Soto is now fourth all-time in home runs by a teenager. The only people ahead of him? Tony Conigliaro, Bryce Harper, and Met Ott.
Harper strikes out to end the inning. He's 0 for 3 with three K's against Arrieta.
On review, looked like he got caught in the dirt and that's why his head flipped into the dirt. Either way, he seems ok, but ow. https://t.co/WjXqpQwRlL
That is not the outcome I would have expected if the field was too soft. Weird. We almost had two lost teeth in one day. https://t.co/3Mo4tKdVqY
Eaton goes as Turner strikes out. Looks like he slid on his face, which isn't the recommended approach. Jeez. He's all scraped up.
Arrieta hits Eaton with one out in the fifth.
Roark gets Santana to hit into an inning-ending double play, and he's at 46 pitches through four scoreless.
Ramos shoots a one-out single to right for his first hit of the night.
It's a double and an error.
Matt Wieters is on third base with what I don't think will be called a triple but does have the Nationals dugout laughing hysterically.
Juan Soto just homered. 3-0 Nationals. His 17th.
Rendon walks for the second time in Game 2, so the Nats have another man on in front of Soto.
He's staying in. So Harper is stepping in. Looked like it got him on the in-step of his right foot.
Ramos got hit and the trainers are coming out to check now.
Roark through three scoreless on 32 pitches. Nats 1, Phils 0.
Nothing for the Nats in the top of the third.
Roark gets Herrera to hit into an inning-ending DP. After two, Nats 1, Phillies 0.
Franco waits out a breaking ball and hits a single up the middle with one out in the second.
RT @PostSports: Spencer Kieboom’s HR gives Nationals’ offense some teeth in Game 1 win, and Washington is back to .500 https://t.co/MFJQTGl…

Turner makes a great play in the hole to get Ramos. Reynolds with a nice scoop on the other end. Two down.
Hoskins hits a one-out double so the Phillies are first to rally in game 2.

Nationals win 3-1. Not an easy save for Doolittle, but he gutted it out. They're back to .500. Game 2 in 30 minutes.
Franco bloops a single to left and the Phillies cut the lead to 3-1.
Meanwhile, Doolittle has wrestled through some command issues to record two outs in the ninth. Franco now.
Someone just yelled "boolittle," which feels like an excellent Halloween Twitter nickname so something productive has come out of this day already.
Wow, Doolittle bounces one and the runner advances to second. Kieboom will go out and chat.
Doolittle has now fallen behind Cabrera 3-0, too.
Doolittle walks Santana to start the ninth.
Call overturned. He's out. To the bottom of the ninth we go. Here comes Doolittle.
Turner advances on a passed ball, but barely. Phillies will challenge. Alfaro has a cannon. He might have gotten him.
Turner doubles with two-out in the ninth. Nats can pick up another run here, Harper due.
Taylor will pinch hit to start the top of the ninth.
Doolittle the only one in the Zumba class right now, getting loose for the ninth.
Holland strikes out Bautista and the Nats take a 3-0 lead to the ninth.
RT @dcsportsbog: GW’s Jumbotron fell to the floor while undergoing maintenance, but "it looks far worse than it actually was" https://t.co/…

Suero is warming.
Holland gets Hernandez to go around on a pitch in the dirt. Two down.
Crawford hits one off the right field wall, so the Phillies have a runner in scoring position with one out in the eighth.
@Insanesmitty Smitty, this is obviously a joke and not something anyone is taking super seriously. Please smile once in awhile. It's good for you.
He grounded into a force out. Holland gets the eighth.
"Kieboom, who today rendered toothless all arguments against his power-hitting abilities..." https://t.co/9VJhuIPobw
Difo walks. Bases loaded for...Spencer Kieboom.
"Just doing Juan Soto things" and "It's actually working" (blow-torches) are my two favorite quotes of this season. https://t.co/uNEmE0MdLs
Zimmerman hits one up the middle and Hernandez can't quite reel it in. 3-0 Nationals.
Now Soto hits one to right. Rendon will go to third. Runners on the corners with two out for Zimmerman, who has a chance to provide some insurance here.
Rendon knocks out a two-out single through the left side to give the Nats some action in the eighth.
Juan Soto just made an incredible catc, leaping into the stands to pluck a foul pop up out of harm's way. Inning over. After seven, Nats 2, Phillies 0.
Lilliquist out for a #moundvisit as Grace and Holland throw.
Williams sneaks a blooper just over Difo's reach, so the Phillies have a two-out runner in the seventh.

Now Kieboom singles and kids everywhere are pulling out their own teeth to keep the major league dream alive.
Glover is warming.
Miller gets Knapp to line out to Eaton. Nats lead 2-0 after six. Fedde throws 5 2/3 scoreless.
Fedde allowed just two hits in 5 2/3 innings. Struck out career-high nine, walked two. 100 pitches.
Fedde walks Hoskins, and Martinez will come get him. Miller will take over.
Davey will leave Fedde in.
Hernandez singles up the middle, just the Phillies' second hit against Fedde. Martinez isn't waiting around, and is headed out to talk to him.
Fedde has a career-high nine strikeouts after getting Ramos there.
Ramos pinch hits for Neris, who faced four whole batters and therefore simply had to be removed.

None of us, including Nats PR, know where Kieboom's tooth went. This was a shock to all of us. https://t.co/OR5FOUsTRr
Kapler changed pitchers again. Hector Neris gets his batter now.
Fedde through five scoreless on 80 pitches. Seven K's.
@Nikodogpsp and have used four. My math isn't great but...
Fedde comes back from 3-0 to strike out Cabrera. Nats always talk about the competitiveness and you see it when he falls behind. Hates to give in.
Currently looks like a Zumba class is happening in the Nats bullpen where a half dozen pitchers are stretching and getting loose.
Call stands. Inning over. Nats take a 2-0 lead.
Oh my gosh they're going to review this. We might get to see 10,004 pitchers in one inning after all!
Harper hits one to right and another run scores. Then he gets caught leading too far off first. Nats 2, Phillies 0.
Fortunately the Phillies only have 16 other pitchers on their roster. Literally.
Turner walks. Kapler will make ANOTHER change. He's matching up batter for batter in the fifth, and no one here is happy about it.
Avilan gets Eaton and now Kapler will make another change. A fan in the stands: "We've got another game tonight Gabe!"
Pivetta is done. Avilan will relieve him with one out in the fifth.
That's his first major league hit. https://t.co/SNsHloTJHC
Fedde singles.
Spencer Kieboom has his first career home run. Nats lead 1-0.
Trea Turner starts a double play out of a shift and Fedde is through four scoreless. 61 pitches.
Four straight strikeouts for Fedde.
Nothing for the Nats in the fourth.
This infield dirt seems to be slowing balls down a bit. Thought Rendon's had a chance to get through, took an easy hop. Though Soto had a hit, Hernandez had time to get there. Nice play.
A new kind of water torture. https://t.co/ALjC71s6qR
Harper walks for the second time this afternoon. This time he's on to start the fourth.
Fedde comes back from 3-0 on Hernandez and strikes out the side. He's at 49 pitches through three.
Nothing for the Nats in the third.
Eaton takes second on a passed ball. Phillies argued briefly Turner hit it, but he did not. Worth a try.
Eaton draws a two-out walk.
Fedde throws a 1-2-3 second. Scoreless after one.
I would imagine this infield will yield a lot of tough hops today, particularly as the game(s) go along.
Zimmerman seems to be ok, but doesn't look particularly happy.
Wow. Zim tkes  tough hop off the leg, but it bounces all the way to Difo. Fedde covers. They get the 3-4-1 out.
Nats down in order in the second. Someone did yell "Let's go Wilmer!" at Difo just now, so there's at least one Nats fan in attendance.
Fedde strikes out Santana on a fastball away. He's through a scoreless first on 19 pitches.
Now Bour takes third uncontested as the Nats shift on Santana.
Woah, Juan Soto has a tough time with that line drive that slices away from him. I think it just took off on him.
Here comes Erick Fedde, who thought he would pitch Sunday, then Monday...etc.
Rendon pops out to end a 26-pitch first. Nothing for the Nats.
Harper draws a two-out walk.
Turner hits into a 4-6-3 DP. They got him by a half a step at first. Two down.
Adam Eaton leads off the game with a 10-pitch AB that ends in a single.
It's so quiet here you can hear the radio broadcast as they're playing. It's weird.
Someone just threw a ball at a guy holding a bat and if I remember correctly this is baseball.
The Phillies are taking the field. A game is starting.

It is almost sunny out right now. Legit. I'm not kidding. Also they've stopped working on the field. We're being lulled into a false sense of security.
As of right now Ross will start Thursday, but that’s obviously tentative.
The problem today will be whether the field can withstand a) two games’ worth of action and b) more rain. Both are scheduled to test it. https://t.co/BMOl1kuQxW
So @FightinHydrant just walked on the field. Said it’s OK. There you go.
Nats for Game 1: Eaton RF, Turner SS, Harper CF, Rendon 3B, Soto LF, Zimmerman 1B, Difo 2B, Kieboom C, Fedde P.
@FightinHydrant You’re not wrong — my favorite pastime!!!

Nationals, by the way, aren't angry. Their decision-makers joked that they can't really say much about handling of the weather the way things have gone for them over the years. They know how hard it can be.
The blow torches are out again.
Fedde will pitch Game 1, Roark Game 2 -- assuming the rain holds off.
Scherzer said the field was “spongey.” If you put your foot down, it gave out. Obvious to him and to Rhys Hoskins — the players who went out to consult — that it wasn’t playable and would only get worse once people started running on it.
Nats are already changed and heading out. Passed Matt Grace, who said only “it’s a special time.”
Doubleheader starting at 3:05 pm tomorrow. At least we’re in shape for it.
This is so insane.

This game has not officially been delayed yet, by the way.
Back comes Scherzer...
He's been down there as Harper and Scherzer walked off. So he would know. https://t.co/yULq21Jd8y
I've always wondered what the decision-making process is like for situations like these. From here, it looks like a lot of standing and taking fake leads. If this is the norm, this is not what I expected.
Now Scherzer is leaving the field. I don't know what any of this means.
Harper is now walking off, his retreat delayed because the security guard wanted a picture.
Harper has picked up a rake. He tried it out. Now he's tossing drying agent on the field like he's feeding birds. Bryce Harper is trying to scatter diamond dry on the field. This is where we are.
...and here comes Harper. He pretended to slip on the base line. That was genius.
This whole season has given new meaning to the phrase "scorched earth." https://t.co/gdoAm01L0z
Now it looks like rain is coming at us from downtown....
Gabe Kapler just tried to run the basepaths. Here's hoping everyone decides he and Davey need to race to adequately test this out.
Scherzer is a union rep, so I think that's why he's chatting with the umps here.
This the best rain delay we've had in weeks!

All of this is real. Every blow torching bit. https://t.co/wiv44w3p72
Big meeting of all the minds (aka, an assembly of bald heads, Kapler, and Davey) at first base right now.
Kapler is leading them on a tour of the infield. https://t.co/YuTi8gZoeu
Davey, Riz, and Bob Miller are now coming out to check on the field.
It's been a long week for the Nats, and maybe I won't feel the same when I'm here til 1 a.m., but this is hilarious.
Stephen Strasburg just walked up to the infield dirt, pushed a toe down, and tilted his head to the side before turning around to go back into the dugout.
Which makes me wonder... if they weren't sure the blowtorches would work but went with them anyway, what ideas did they REJECT?
This is incredible. https://t.co/t7E0wt2jgB
The Phillies didn't tarp the field Friday night. Didn't expect as much rain as they got. Then it rained all weekend, so they never got a chance to dry it out. This night has the clearest forecast of the three.
Howard Smith, the Phillies VP of Business Affairs, told reporters the blowtorches are not something they keep around just in case. They brought them in from the outside for this occasion.
General sense around here is this game is going to be pushed back a bit while they get the field ready. But that's not official, and they've added more blowtorches so maybe it'll be ready in time.
They have propane tanks in wheelbarrows.

It’s is an issue I often grapple with in how people address me in this job, and we just have to take the opportunity to think about it.
Serena was handled differently than men have been. Period. Think about why, and think about why so many are moved to say she wasn’t.
Sexism, like racism, doesn’t always have to be calculated or overt. I think it’s the subconscious kind that proves more harmful.
Among many striking things about this, to me, is the number of men replying that gender wasn’t a factor, or the sexist aspect is overblown. https://t.co/Cz1hEuS0Tv

RT @_JakeRussell: Daniel Murphy's reaction to Sean Doolittle riding the bullpen cart is just as great. https://t.co/ZEs1sfS3F3
But they probably will. Because that's how it's gone. https://t.co/Y2RMjGZsMj
I mean the game's official. It's gonna rain all night. So I think at this point you've gotta call it. You can't make them wait again.
They got to the bottom of the eighth inning. THE BOTTOM OF THE EIGHTH INNING. And now the tarp comes back.
Doolittle gets through the eighth. It's pouring. Grounds crew coming out to dry the field. Turnour giving the umps the weather report to the umps. They call for the tarp.
Doolittle's velo is a little down here, but looks to be as deceptive as ever, judging by Murphy's swings and that one from Caratini.
Rain really picking up here. I would imagine they're going to play through this until it is absolutely impossible to do so.
Doolittle strikes out Murphy. Somewhat emphatically, actually.
I am so pleased.
Sean Doolittle has just become the first pitcher to use the Nationals Park bullpen cart. History.
Here comes the bullpen cart. Sean Doolittle is going to get in it.
Martinez will bring in Doolittle for Murphy. GUYS
Murphy is on deck to pinch hit.
Glover gets the eighth. Doolittle, remember, is available for the ninth.
Harper. His 32nd. Nationals 6, Cubs 5.
Now Maddon will make a pitching change, get Wilson in for Harper here.
Rendon drives one to the gap in left center. 5-4.
Turner has an infield single with one out in the seventh.
Glover warming in the bullpen.
Eaton leads off the bottom of the seventh, pinch hitting for Suero.
Suero gets Baez to ground out, so at the stretch, it's Cubs 5, Nats 3.
They'll walk Rizzo and let Suero face Baez.
Bryant hits one to the gap in left center. It's 5-3.
Now Gore steals third as Suero strikes out Almora Jr. Two out, man on third for the Cubs.
Gore goes and steals second. He's absurdly fast. He's at second with one out.
Davey will get Solis with one down in the seventh.
Kieboom strikes out to end the sixth. To the seventh we go, in the rain. Solis starts the seventh.
RT @PostSports: When Werth finally addressed the crowd, he demonstrated the charisma that has always made him more memorable for who he is…
Sanchez doubles home Zimmerman, and it's 4-3.
Rendon homers. 4-2.
RT @Nationals: "We love it here, and are so proud to call Washington, DC our home."		- Jayson Werth #WerthDay https://t.co/4GwHwE3C45
Solis gets through a scoreless sixth. Rain coming down pretty seriously now.
Schwarber greets Solis with a single to start the sixth as the rain starts again.
Nothing for the Nats in the fifth... but this is now an official game.
Strong showing from Williams, who works a scoreless fifth against the heart of the order.
Austen Williams gets the fifth.
Adrian Sanchez is destroying baseballs today and finally has something to show for it, an RBI triple. 4-1.
Hamels walks Harper to start the fourth.
Inning ends as Cubs jump out to a 4-0 lead. Important to remember how important it is to get through five innings. Rain, like winter, is coming.
Now Rodriguez walks Hamels and it’s  time for a #moundvisit
Caratini hits a two-out grand slam. 4-0 Cubs.
Rodriguez strikes out Bote. Two outs.
They walked Schwarber to load the bases.
Zimmerman can’t handle Baez’s hotshot up the line and Rodriguez is in a two-on, one-out jam with Schwarber due.
(just kidding, obviously. But the walk-up collection took a big hit when he left, and just hasn't recovered.) https://t.co/zvVTotEvff
I think Jayson Werth should be an example to young Nationals players: Pick better, fun, and unique walk-up songs, get inducted into the Ring of Honor. It's not hard.
Jefry Rodriguez strikes out the side in the second.
Rodriguez works a scoreless first.
And off we go for game two...
It’s been a tough season. This place needed a little Jayson Werth.
Still got it? https://t.co/L9UlFJYDHD
Zim just brought Werth a rocking chair on behalf of his teammates. He sat in it.
Here we go. https://t.co/XtgqChFFgc
Max told Davey he could pitch Game 2. Davey politely declined.
Nats win, 10-3. Complete game for Scherzer. Now to Jayson Werth night...then to trying to get in Game 2.
Scherzer gets Bryant on a fastball. Two down.
This is just the most Scherzer thing. https://t.co/EmYDZGgpox
He's staying for Bryant.
Martinez will go get him with Bryant looming. Although Max looks like he wants to stay...
ANOTHER hit for the Cubs as Russell singles up the middle. Scherzer has hit a little bit of a wall here it appers.
Kris Bryant is in the on deck circle to pinch hit.
Davis hits a fly ball to right. One out. Run scores, so it's 10-2.
Suero is warming.
Wow, three straight hits and the bases are loaded with no one out. Bullpen will have to get going.
Now Gore singles up the middle. Scherzer has two on and no one out at 98 pitches.
Caratini singles to start the ninth.
Here comes Scherzer for the ninth, to the same music he starts the game with, as usual.
Nobody warming, by the way. Seemed obvious, but Scherzer will get a chance to finish this off.
Reynolds hits into the ugliest DP I've seen, but hey.
Difo walks to start the eighth.
Scherzer through eight on 92 pitches. He might finish this one.
That's his 16th 10K game of the season in his 30th start. 80th of his career, most among active pitchers -- but you knew that.
Scherzer has 10 strikeouts again. Ho hum.
Murphy out of the game, too. Bote will hit for him here.
Difo takes over at second. Sanchez takes over at third. Taylor in center, Robles to right. So Davey gets Harper and Rendon out of the game.
Inning over. To the eighth we go, 10-1 Nationals. There should be a rain-coming mercy rule.
10-1.
Scherzer singles. It's 9-1.
It started raining.
Scherzer will hit for himself in the bottom of the seventh, which makes sense given he's thrown only 80 pitches.
Chatwood hits Robles, who went down in a heap but appears to be fine.
Baez pops out on the first pitch. Scherzer through seven on 80 pitches. Nats lead, 8-1.
Baez will pinch hit here with two on and two out in the seventh.
RT @hankschulman: Gio definitely tweaked his leg taking an awkward step on a his sixth pitch as a Brewer. But he strikes out d'Arnaud, walk…
Contreras singles. 8-1.
Zobrist hits a first-pitch single so Scherzer is in a jam with runners on the corners and no one out.
Caratini hits a dribbler that finds the right spot and he's on to start the seventh.
Soto not happy with the strike three call to end the inning. Nats lead 8-0.
Reynolds grounds into a fielder's choice. 8-0. Plenty of room for Scherzer to be aggressive, try to go very deep into this game ahead of a second game in which they'll probably need a lot of their relievers.
Harper grounds to second. Murphy comes home. Contreras can't catch it. 7-0, and the Cubs are playing sloppy.
Now a ball gets by Contreras. 6-0.
Wow. Rendon pops one to short right and no one can come up with it. They get no outs. 5-0 and they're loaded for Harper. Nats have a shot to break this wide open.
Maddon will come get Rosario. Norwood relieves him with Rendon due and the bases loaded.
Turner walks. 4-0.
Scherzer gets the bunt down. Contreras tries to get the out at third but the throw is wide. Bases are loaded for Turner.
Wieters walks and Sanchez singles and Scherzer gets a chance with two on and one out.
Robles drops down a bunt and LaStella gets him by a half a step.
Scherzer gets LaStella to hit into a 6-3 DP to end the sixth. He's through six on 65 pitches.
Scherzer goes with the first-pitch curve and Murphy is ready for it. Stays on it and shoots it to left for the Cubs' first hit since the first.
Streak of 15 straight retired snapped as Scherzer hits Happ with a cutter with one out in the sixth.
Reynolds walks and the Nats have something going in the fifth. Two on, one out.
Rizzo makes an outstanding diving stop and De La Rosa can't get to first in time. Harper gets a single.
RT @susanslusser: Shawn Kelley takes over for Jackson; it's Kelley's first appearance since Aug. 29 because of this: A's Shawn Kelley injur…
Two more strikeouts for Scherzer in the fifth. He's at 53 pitches and leads 3-0.
Sanchez hits one to the wall in right center. Just short of damage. Not a bad first swing in a while for him.
Ten-pitch fourth for Scherzer. He's through four scoreless on 41 pitches. Nats lead 3-0.
Cubs go to De La Rosa, which inspires the question -- why did Kintzler hit for himself?
Scherzer wins round two against Murphy, and is through three scoreless on 32 pitches.
Scherzer gets Happ looking at 96. Three straight K's, four total.
Scherzer strikes him out swinging. https://t.co/qPRgQc1lTI
Played catch throughout spring training. Tons of trash talk. This must be fun for both of them. https://t.co/vPZ4JgqwBI
Brandon Kintzler is about to hit against Max Scherzer.
Reynolds grounds into a force out and we head to the third. Nats 3, Cubs 0.
Cubs walk Harper to get to Reynolds with two on and two out.
Now LaStella stumbles as he tries to start a double play. Recovers to get the out at first, but Nats have a runner in scoring position with two out for Harper.
LaStella's throw pulls Rizzo off the bag, so Turner is on with one out. Error.
Scherzer works Kintzler to a full count, then strikes out.
Scherzer works a five-pitch second. Nats 3, Cubs 0.
Two pitches, two outs for Scherzer in the second.
Nats give Scherzer a 3-0 lead with a lengthy first.
Wieters bloops one to left and it falls in front of Happ. 3-0 Nationals.
Robles gets jammed on the first pitch and bloops it to first. Two out.
Garcia done. Kintzler will come in to face Robles. What a world.
And now, with two on and one out, Victor Robles.
Soto hits a chopper that Rizzo can't come up with and the Nats lead 2-0.
Reynolds walks to load the bases with one out for Soto.
Brandon Kintzler is warming.
Double steal. Turner's 37th, Harper's 12th. Both in scoring position with one out for Harper.
Harper walks. Two on, one out, and action in the Cubs bullpen.
Turner steals second, and he's there with one out for Harper in a 3-1 count.
Turner walks to start the bottom of the first.
Scherzer works a 13-pitch scoreless first. Only 35 half-innings to go!
La Stella hits one up the first base line, under Reynolds's glove, and he's on with a double.
Scherzer strikes out Murphy on a 96 mph fastball, and off. we. go.
Max Scherzer is on the mound. Baseball! This is not sarcastic, this is real joy.
Guys, they’re gonna play. This is really happening. We made it.
Here they come. People are going to move the tarp soon. This actually might happen.
Scherzer is running in the outfield, so things are happening. They should have more than enough time to get the field ready by 5:15. Though no one is currently working on it.
@masnKolko @MarkZuckerman ...and when I said that you crushed me for my optimism. Sorry for trying to look on the bright side. Nobody said I was good at it.
The game will start at approximately 5:15 pm. So there's that.
The real miracle is that I haven't yet. https://t.co/OXyPQftsZi
And honestly, that nothing is happening right now is absurd. Get the pregame stuff and anthem and everything out of the way while the rain is tapering. Move the process along. https://t.co/rVQNZVQWua
The security guards are removing their ponchos. Probably time to try to get this going. There are no signs of that.
(I say through gritted teeth while rocking back and forth like a maniac) https://t.co/UTqZMSPzAl
We're an hour in. We are very lucky this is the worst of our problems.
Rain is light enough that people are back in their seats. Hopefully they can start taking some steps to get this going soon.
Rain seems to be letting up a bit. Rizzo and Turnour are out on the track talking it through.
RT @capitalweather: We’re going to get a break from the rain this afternoon/evening once this all moves east. It’s only 66 degrees downtown…
@masnKolko I’ve heard imitation is the greatest form of flattery, so I will take this as a compliment.
So, what the heck happened last night? https://t.co/tl6hSxMa1N
Nats officially announce they've delayed the start of the game due to rain.
Raining pretty hard here. Looks like one group of showers has to move through. Wonder if it'll happen in time to start in 40 minutes, though...
Just met the wonderfully friendly bullpen cart driver. Told him I’ll ask Doolittle for a rider review. He asked if he gets to give a passenger review, too. (YES!)
RT @MDGonzales: Maddon said Cubs were willing to wait as long as possible to play Friday’s game, baffled by decision to postpone game.
Here comes the tarp because the rain is here.
Jefry Rodriguez will start Game 2.
Nevermind, @JamalCollier is not the one cracking today. It’s @masnKolko. Be nice guys.
(Scherzer is normally a player rep, but he had headed out when it got late because he is starting today — like when starters fly ahead of the team before a late get-in)
Eventually, both sides agreed to true doubleheader and the league assented. So it’s league and players who dictated the decisions.
Nats guys were wary of starting a game late on a wet field because those are the circumstances under which Harper suffered that knee injury last year.
Cubs, who need these games, wanted to wait and play. Nats players tried to explain that waiting for a window in DC rarely yields one. Took a long time to agree.
Early in the evening, league came to player reps from both teams (Bryant/LaStella and Harper/Turner/Doolittle) to say we don’t think we can get it in.
Doolittle was an interim player rep last night and explained what happened: Because both teams had played the max number of split doubleheaders allowed by CBA, they had to consent to another.
Ross said there were times last night when he had “no idea” when the game was going to start. Was clearly frustrated with the short start, but did say he felt good.
Robles starts game one: Turner SS, Rendon 3B, Harper RF, Reynolds 1B, Soto LF, Robles CF, Wieters C, Sanchez 2B, Scherzer P.
Field, by the way, looks great. Can't really explain how hard Turnour and Co. have had to work this season. As frustrating as it's been for everyone to deal with the weather, no one has had to work harder because of it than they have.
By the way, for those keeping track, @MarkZuckerman his 2018 season rock bottom Thursday night. I, you might have noticed, hit mine yesterday. Look out @JamalCollier, 2018 is coming for you.

This is absolutely unacceptable. https://t.co/jZtkA3pyGH
They made everyone wait three hours. The rain stopped. Then they cancelled it.
They postponed the game. Doubleheader tomorrow. First game at 3:05.
RT @masnNationals: Wanna feel old? Juan Soto was 12 when this game started... https://t.co/qy8FJRThmU
The rain has all but stopped. No one is doing anything.
At least Neville got the basilisk in time. Things could be worse.
Both teams should be absolutely furious. This is not good for either team. If/when they do resume, they'll do so on an absolutely drenched field at midnight or later. Injury risk spikes. Bullpens will be blown up. It's unnecessary.
They are pulling out the on-deck circle and starting to work on the field. It's still raining. This is insane. It's absolutely insane.
Now Davey and Harper and Doolittle are out on the field, too. Davey shaking hands with the umps and Maddon.
Incidentally, when I think about Turnour and his staff and how hard they work, I realize I should probably stop whining. Rain is much harder for them, and they basically never leave, either.
Maddon, umps, and Bob Miller are all on the field with John Turnour, head of the grounds crew. They're looking around at the field.
How many West Wing episodes can I watch before a decision gets made? I’m starting at the pilot.
I do not understand why we are still here, literally and figuratively.

This is important. Not on the Nats at all. This is on the league. https://t.co/v5kF3JLmLJ
Same. https://t.co/IxyKQJjSb8
Nats will have to be particularly careful with Ross. Fortunately, they've got a lot of depth behind him in the bullpen right now.
...now you've probably burned starters. Inexcusable. We all see the same radar. We all could tell more was coming. https://t.co/jEGnpNuenK
They're putting the tarp on again.
Looks like the rain is really picking up here. Not an easy night for Ross to make his debut part II.
The slider strikes back. Ross gets Bote to swing and miss at that pitch, so key for him, for his first strikeout.
Nothing for the Nats in the first after Daniel Murphy turns a nice DP despite Adam Eaton's slide. Scoreless after one.
Eaton knocks a single up the middle to greet Lester.
Ross works a scoreless inning on 15 pitches.
Now Ross hits Bryant, so he's in a two-on, two-out jam.
Rizzo bloops a single in short left, way in front of Soto, and the Cubs have a man on with two out.
It's raining again.
Ross throws three sinkers to Murphy and he's got his first out in over a year.
Ross returns with a 96 mile per hour fastball. So the velo is definitely there.
@rogernoriegaUSA Roger, I'm not against the anthem. The anthem is a given, and has never been the thing that takes too much time. The rest of the pomp and  circumstance could be truncated on nights like these. A man dressed as a colonist was jumping around for awhile. This is what I mean.
If it's dry enough to stand outside for a half hour for pregame shenanigans, and there's a tight window...wouldn't one think those activities should be shortened in order to play the game everyone came to see?
Nationals say this game will start at 8:25 pm.
Rain picking up again, so that makes me feel better in some twisted way. and this is all about how I feel
It's playable now. No one is playing.
Rain's pretty much stopped now, but no signs of life.
To me, worst case scenario is starting and getting three innings in. Because then you have to do the whole thing again on a rainy weekend. If you start, you better be very sure you're getting this whole game in. https://t.co/3ClcVD1FhU
The rain has slowed a little. Amateur radar reads suggest that will not continue, but I've been wrong before.
They're chalking the foul lines, so apparently they're optimistic this will happen.
Game still delayed. This could be a rough night.
Sean Doolittle is back. https://t.co/rwisU7upfd
Start of tonight's game has been officially delayed, as expected.
So we're about a half hour from game time and it's still pouring and the tarp is still on, so I feel safe saying this game will not start on time.
Found the story from Joe Ross's debut in 2015. Feels like forever ago. https://t.co/nvkXQ1z3DW
Game tonight is in MLB's hands, by the way.
Fans are being told to take cover from severe storms. Lot of lightning and thunder happening.
Davey said he didn't tell Soto to take ground balls at first base, so he was just having fun before the game.
Davey said they aren't sure what they'll do with Hellickson yet, and that a lot of it depends on how Ross fares tonight and how Fedde does Sunday. Don't want to go to a six-man rotation, though.
Can confirm. https://t.co/NJtApPiy8v

Strasburg on planning for Murphy: “He talked a lot about hitting, so I eavesdropped.”
The Nats are three games under .500 for the first time since they were 13-16.
Soto strikes out. Two down.
Rendon singles. Runners on the corners with one out for Soto.
Harper strikes out looking and he has words for the home plate umpire. Lots of them.
Trea Turner walks to start the bottom of the 10th. Tying run to the plate, and it's Harper.
Another run scores. 6-4.
Robles can't get to that ball, and the Cubs take a lead.
Almora Jr. doubles into the right field corner so the Cubs have the go-ahead run in scoring position with one out.
Jimmy Cordero gets the 10th.
Zimmerman grounds out. Extra innings!
Robles strikes out. Here comes Zimmerman.
Stevenson strikes out. Robles now. Then pinch hitter Ryan Zimmerman.
Jimmy Cordero warming for the 10th, which is not a sentence I was hoping to type tonight for non-Jimmy Cordero reasons.
Martinez will send the lefty Stevenson up against Strop. Robles on deck.
Strop will pitch the bottom of the ninth.
Holland works a 1-2-3 ninth against the heart of the Cubs' order. To the bottom of the ninth we go.
Holland gets the ninth.
Difo lines out. To the ninth we go, tied at 4.
Reynolds strikes out swinging. Up to Difo with two on and two out.
I think Maddon is going to bring in the lefty Wilson to face Reynolds.
Soto rockets a double into the right field corner and the Nationals have the go-ahead run at third base with one out in the eighth. Holland warming.
Harper walks to start the eighth.
Collins gets him. A plot twist! To the bottom of the eighth we go, tied at 4.
Of course it's Murphy. Of course. This season has been literary in all the wrong ways.
Miller gets ahead of LaStella 0-2 and now hits him. Murphy due. Martinez will go get Collins to face him.
Miller strikes out Happ, and the Cubs will pinch hit with Tommy LaStella here with two out and the go-ahead run at second.
Gore steals second. Kieboom threw from his knees and made it close, so the Nats will see if they should challenge. They will not. Go-ahead run in scoring position.
So a ground ball scores the tying run, but Turner throws behind Almora Jr. and keeps the go-ahead run at first with one out.
Back-to-back singles to start the eighth, and the Cubs have two men in scoring position with no one out.
Bryant starts the eighth with a single to left.
Never thought we'd see Soto, Robles, and Harper in the same outfield. This is something. I don't know what, but it's something.
Robles stays in center. Harper moves to right. Eaton out. Soto, Robles, Harper in the outfield.
Turner strikes out so Miller takes over with a one-run lead in the eighth.
Cubs will change pitchers now with two down in the seventh. Cishek takes over.
Now Robles gets caught trying to go so he's out.
Kieboom has the first three-hit day of his career. Robles pinch hits for the pitcher now.
Justin Miller is warming for the eighth.
Glover works a 1-2-3 seventh.
Nothing for the Nats in the bottom of the sixth. Glover gets the seventh. Nats new-look bullpen gets tested with a one-run lead against the best team in the NL.
Reynolds continues to make the most of his chances. Knocks a two-out single in the sixth.
Grace gets Murphy to hit a fly ball to left. Strasburg's line: 5 2/3 innings, two earned runs on six hits. Six K's, three walks.
Strasburg gets Russell on his 111th pitch, and Martinez will come get him to bring in Grace for Murphy.
Strasburg walks Schwarber, so he'll get Russell with one down and his pitch count at 104. Martinez could have pinch hit, opted to stick with Strasburg. Probably now has to go to Grace for Murphy.
Schwarber will pinch hit for Hendricks, who is done after five innings and 74 pitches.
Nobody warming yet, but the bullpen phone just rang, so Nats will get someone up behind Strasburg, who will start the sixth at 95 pitches.
Turner comes up with a two-out hit to put the Nats ahead again. 4-3.
Kieboom strikes again with his second hit of the night, so the Nats have a runner on to start the fifth.
Strasburg gets a ground ball to get out of it. That run is unearned. 3-3 in the fifth.
Strasburg walks Bryant, so he gets Almora Jr. with runners on the corners with two out in the fifth. Pitch count climbing.
Zobrist hits a sac fly and the Cubs tie it at three.
Lightning has been flashing for an hour or so, but it seems to be staying away. Pretty crazy sight.
Rendon throws way high on a charging play there and Rizzo goes to second on the throw. Runners at second and third with one out.
Murphy greets Strasburg with a single to start the fifth.
Reynolds hits a 3-2 change-up out to left. It's 3-2 Nationals.

Rizzo singles through the shift and Baez scores from first. 1-0 Cubs.
Strasburg gets Murphy to swing through a change-up and he's got two down in the third.
Velo down, but the results are fine for Strasburg. He's through two scoreless at 32 pitches.
Nats down in order against Hendricks, who had them off balance in the first.
Strasburg strikes out Bryant on a 94 mph fastball and he's through a scoreless first.
Overturned. Safe at first.

Despite selling key pieces, the Nationals will not be under the competitive balance tax threshold this year. A lot here: https://t.co/l3qAmgCE1s
Rizzo on Dave Martinez serving as manager in 2019: “I haven’t considered any other scenario.” Those are carefully chosen words for a reason. https://t.co/J9pX4XL4FF
Zimmerman on how he feels after that slide into home: “it’s not too bad. Not great... but it’s not too bad.”
Taylor strikes out to end it. Nats fall, 7-6. They're 69-71.
Sanchez is on deck.
Difo hits a fly ball to center. Two down. Here comes Michael A.
Taylor on deck to hit in the catcher's spot.
Zimmerman strikes out looking. Was not thinking he'd get a slider for a strike there. Good pitch from Martinez.
No one warming for the Cardinals, by the way.
Sorry, Carpenter at first. Carpenter kicked it. Error. https://t.co/C2HxnCyjwj
Now Soto hits one so hard that Martinez kicks it all the way back to Martinez who can't get to the bag and the Nats have the go-ahead run on with no one out.
Rendon bloops a single to right and the tying run is on with no one out.
Martinez will stay to pitch the ninth.
Eaton makes a leaping catch in the gap to save some runs. Nats will go to the bottom of the ninth down one. Rendon, Soto, Zimmerman.
@masnKolko This is not your only rant of today and I think you're doing yourself a disservice by suggesting you only rant once daily.
@carolinematas Palatial Friday
Ozuna pops to right, too shallow to score a run. Two down. DeJong now.
Couple close calls go against him and Miller walks Wisdom. Now he gets Ozuna with one out and the bases loaded. #moundvisit
@carolinematas who taught you the word whackadoodle?
Miller, trying to keep Nats down a run, is in a two-on, one-out jam in the top of the ninth.
Harper strikes out looking to end the inning. To the ninth we go. Miller will pitch it.
Eaton singles, so the Nats have the tying run on with one out in the eighth. He's 3 for 5 tonight.
Martinez will pitch the eighth. Molina is out of the game.
Another scoreless inning for Suero. Nats down a run heading to the bottom of the eighth.
Call stands. He's out. Two down in the eighth.
After all that, Suero somehow picked him off anyway. Never give up.
Molina got a MASSIVE jump, but Severino still throws him out. He's slow to get up.
Severino hits a line drive, but it stays up for Bader. So the Nats get within a run. Suero will start the eighth.
Call stands. 7-6.
Cardinals will challenge. It's close.
Difo singles. Henley sends Zimmerman, who is slow to get up. Slides are never kind to him. But he's safe. 7-6.
Zimmerman destroys one to dead center. Bader can't come up with it. Everybody scores. It's 7-5.
Hudson unintentionally intentionally walks Soto and now he'll face Zimmerman with the bases loaded.
Cardinals bring in Hudson to face Soto -- a righty/lefty matchup.
Rendon doubles. Nats have two on and two out in the seventh.
Harper singles so he's 3 for 4 today.
Suero works a scoreless seventh. At the stretch, Nats trail 7-2.
Suero gets the seventh.
Reynolds is pinch hitting for McGowin, so his major league debut is over after an inning and a homer.
Difo doubles home Zimmerman. 7-2.
McGowin allows the homer and nothing else in the sixth. It's 7-1 Cardinals.
...but there, he fell behind 3-1 and left a fastball over when he tried to get back in it. 7-1.
Got an unofficial scouting report on McGowin from Seve the other day. The general takeaway: If he puts the glove somewhere, McGowin will hit it. And the secondary stuff has taken huge leaps this year.
Kyle McGowin, who started for Syracuse on Sunday, is making his major league debut here in the sixth. It's his throw day, so the Nats will give him an inning or so.
This team has been hard to love for a lot of reasons this year. But in Soto and Robles, they have two players that love playing so much it's impossible not to love watching them. Won't always do something spectacular, but they always have that potential, and that's something.
Call overturned. Robles scores. 6-1.
Robles tries to score from first and they call Robles out at the plate on a weird slide. I think he got there, though.
Robles bloops a single to right and takes the biggest turn time would allow. So he's on with one out in the fifth.
Robles will pinch hit for Roark.
Roark needs 111 pitches to get through five. That'll almost certainly be it for him. 6-0.
Austen Williams is warming. Martinez said he wanted to get him right back out there.
Adams whacks a first-pitch change out to right field. Second deck. Just crushed. 6-0.
Roark works a scoreless fourth. He's at 88 pitches, trailing 5-0.
Rendon grounds out. Nothing for the Nats in the third.
Another infield hit for the Nats and the bases are loaded with two out for Rendon.
Back-to-back singles from Eaton and Turner give Harper a chance with two out and two on in the third.
Zimmerman hurries to the dugout to make a tiptoed catch at the top step, but fell in with the ball so he carried it out of play. Ozuna gets second. #2018
Roark hasn't been perfectly sharp, but the defense has definitely let him down here, too.
The September sky at the start of games here, as well as during day games, is notorious. But that was a particularly strange one.
Harper totally lost that ball. Not sure if he was trying to deke Carpenter by camping under it, but that was weird. Double. 4-0.
Rendon double-clutches on that ball and Mikolas gets a base hit.
Bader traps that ball and Henley sends Harper, who is out by a lot.
Harper doubles into the right field corner for the Nats' first hit. He holds up three again, which I misinterpreted last night and must be a thing I don't understand.
@CandaceDBuckner hey! hi!
Roark settles down and holds the Cardinals to three. 20 pitches.
Now Ozuna's blooper falls in front of Eaton, who I would absolutely expect to make that catch normally. I'm not sure why he pulled up at the last minute. Definitely a long run. But still odd.
Adams hits a first-pitch curveball out to right center. 3-0.
Carpenter bloops a single to right.

BUT, teams over the threshold get a much lower pick for players who receive qualifying offers (cough, Harper, cough) than those under it. So the main difference is that the Nats get a fourth round pick, not a second, if Harper leaves. https://t.co/q7fvAPkWE1
Changes the dynamic of those deals somewhat. If you aren't trying to get under that number, you're truly just offloading -- which has value in itself and does save money that can be put back into the team. https://t.co/0Of8AhirG6
Have confirmed from those familiar with the details that the Nationals will NOT be under the competitive balance tax threshold ($197 million) this year. This had been implied, but never said explicitly.
Rizzo on Davey: "He's managed them through a lot of trials and tribulations that a lot of first year managers haven't had to go through. To have the team playing with the exuberance and energy level that they're playing at at this point I think is a testament to Davey."

Rizzo said Nats front office thought all along these deals wouldn’t get them under the luxury tax threshold.

Nats today: Eaton RF, Turner SS, Harper CF, Rendon 3B, Soto LF, Zimmerman 1B, Difo 2B, Severino C, Roark P
RT @EireannDolan: I forbid you from hitting a homer off @whatwouldDOOdo BUT if you do you’d better make it count https://t.co/ZEncNVK2EZ
It’s easy to see a future in Soto and Robles. But between potential and lasting stardom is a long and winding road. https://t.co/T5lO5ZIsmh
RT @PostSports: Soto and Robles have the “it” factor, so hard to define and harder to find https://t.co/1twgC07rvb
Suero is out because he can't close his glove. Hand still sore from when he took the line drive off it Sunday.
Martinez on pitcher struggles: "That's gonna happen with these young guys, but they're going to get an opportunity to pitch. They gotta realize, if they wanna pitch here, they gotta get outs. These are the things we have to see. I can't keep using the same guys every single day."
Davey also acknowledged that Solis doesn’t have to pitch to Molina if Difo covered first. https://t.co/Lu3ioW7FlQ
Also said he’s going to talk to Solis about making adjustments. Talent is there.
Davey said he felt like Williams relied too much on his fastball, didn’t use the good breaking ball. Williams said “100 percent agree.” Said the fastballs that got hit weren’t very good pitches and he learned he needs to trust his breaking ball up here.
Davey was heated after the game. Said of the young guys “they’re going to get an opportunity to pitch...they have to realize that if they want to be here, they have to get outs.”
RT @AdamMcCalvy: Gio Gonzalez will make his first Brewers start on Saturday against the Giants. Junior Guerra to the bullpen.
@bradmattia @MarkZuckerman @dougherty_jesse @masnNationals We’ve asked about his thought process every day. Today might finally be a day to realize there aren’t many options right now.
That game lasted four hours and 10 minutes.
Nats fall, 11-8. They did not do so swiftly.
@RattoNBCS I am 10 minutes away from throwing myself at the field
This is currently the second-longest nine-inning game in Nationals history. Second only to that gem against the Pirates the day after they clinched in 2017.
Difo walks and it's PITCHING CHANGE TIME!
Zimmerman doubles. Two runs score. 11-8.
Soto strikes out. Two down. Zimmerman is the Nats' last hope.
Rendon doubles so it's 11-6. Two on with one out now for Soto.
Harper hits a line drive to right, but Martinez tracks it down. Runners on the corners with one out for Rendon.
Now Turner singles. Two on, no one out for Harper.
Eaton starts the ninth with an infield single.
I meant finish.
Inning comes to an end. Nats have the top of the order down six.
0-2 pitch. This is Solis's inning to visit. Nats not warming anyone. https://t.co/j0CUo3NN5u
Molina hits a grand slam, so it's 11-5.
Yadi chant has broken out among those remaining here, who are mostly Cardinals fans for obvious reasons.
Solis hits DeJong to load the bases for Molina, and three hours and 40 minutes in is a good time for a #moundvisit.
Difo doesn't get to first in time on that bunt so now Solis is in a two-on, no out jam.
Solis walks Carpenter to start the ninth.
Nothing for the Nats in the eighth. Solis gets the ninth.
Grace works a scoreless eighth.
Grace won this round.
#SeptemberBaseball https://t.co/HaJLnKMNJ0
As @masnKerr points out, we are now watching a matchup of Grace versus Wisdom. If you can't have both, which would you take?
Nothing for the Nats in the seventh. Grace will get the eighth.
@masnKolko Wake Me Up When September Ends was about people on the baseball beat
Glover gets the seventh.
Lot of good contact for the Nats, but only Difo's home run to show for it in the sixth. They trail 7-5 as we barrel to the seventh.
Vic drives one to dead center, but Bader tracks it down. He gets a nice ovation.
Severino walks and Robles will pinch hit, his first MLB AB this year.
Difo, power hitter, homers to right to bring the Nats within two.
Cordero gets them out of that sixth. Nats trail 7-4.
Anyway, I get the frustration there with Williams. Definitely could have come out sooner. But I also understand the inclination to let a guy see if he can recover. And (gasp!) to maybe even give him a second chance some time.
To me (and what do I know?) if you're going to sell off, you're doing it halfway if you don't let guys take some punches. You tried someone in a big spot, they didn't succeed. Next time, you'll try someone else. If someone sticks, you've found something you didn't know you had.
Cordero will take over.
Now they're booing/cheering Davey as he comes out to get Williams.
Harper wants to play. Needs numbers for the contract. They want to get Soto RoY, and that's ok to want. https://t.co/oE21wxiKuI
The way the Nats have handled this inning signals to me clearly that they're going to let the young guys take their knocks this month. Like Rodriguez the other day, get out of your own trouble. That will not always be pretty.
Davey is going to stick with Williams as Collins warms.
Now Wisdom homers. 7-4
Williams did not allow a homer in 68 minor league innings this season. Has a reputation in organization as a tough kid that doesn't back down. We'll see how he responds here.
Now DeJong hits an 0-2 pitch out, so the Cardinals go back-to-back. Nats will have to endure some growing pains if they really want to give these young guys a chance.
Ozuna strikes again. 5-4 Cardinals.
Zimmerman strikes out, but the Nationals tie it. Austen Williams will get the sixth.
Another pitching change for the Cardinals. Tyson Ross comes in.
Soto draws a walk and NOW the game is tied. Only difference is Harper is at 89 RBI, for those concerned with that. Loaded with two out for Zimmerman.
Did not see why that would have been ruled dead, but the Nats trail 4-3. https://t.co/MfmOn493kM
Oh sorry, they ruled that an automatic double. So he only gets two. Weird. Nats still trail 4-3. https://t.co/brtwDwZfZw
Harper held up three fingers after that -- three RBI. He's at 90 now. Has never hit 100.
Harper drives one to the gap in left center and the Nats tie it.
Turner draws a bases loaded walk. It's 4-1.
Eaton strikes out looking. Turner now with two outs.
Stevenson walks, so they're loaded for Eaton with one out and that'll do it for Gant.
Meanwhile, Fedde's night is over after he allowed four runs on four hits and struck out seven in five innings. Settled down well after crazy second inning.
Severino bloops one into short right and the Nats have their first good  chance of the evening with runners on the corners and one out.
Fedde through five on 91 pitches. Nats trail 4-0.
A friend gave me a Frozen one once, but the subliminal associations with “Let It Go” worries me too much to break it out. https://t.co/BXfTnLfLex
Fedde works around a walk to throw a scoreless fourth. He's at 81 pitches, and will start his third time through the order in the fifth. Nats have plenty of depth behind him now.
@MarkZuckerman It’s kind of like holding the all-time ball record. Not ideal, but you’re in the book.
I think @MarkZuckerman covered him, right? https://t.co/GZLLt5J2ic
This is absolutely nuts, by the way. https://t.co/HckH4dExDt
Juan Soto has walked 67 times this season, most by a teenager since 1900.
Eight-pitch, scoreless third for Fedde, so that's better. He's at 63 pitches through three. Nats trail 4-0.
Zimmerman comes down with Rendon's high throw and that ends the inning for Fedde, whose pitch count climbed to 55.
Now Fedde balks Carpenter to second as a long inning gets longer.
Eaton struggled to pick that one up in right, so his error allows the third run to score.
Now Carpenter clears the bases with a single to right. it's 4-0.
See guys? It happens. https://t.co/9nyJXWgaF8

Fedde walks Bader so he's got the bases loaded and one out for Gant, who homered against Gio in St. Louis after never reaching base before ever.
Now back-to-back singles have Fedde in a jam in the second.
Ozuna gets a 3-1 slider and hits it out to left. 1-0 Cardinals.
It's basically as if Harper had walked and the Cardinals threw down to first and Harper stepped off the bag when Carpenter had the ball. It isn't dead just because someone walks, at least not until someone declares it dead. https://t.co/bTCAbfER3k
Cardinals are going to challenge this play, and call is overturned. Turner overslid second. Tough call given Harper walked on the play.
Joe Ross will return to the rotation Friday as the Nationals take stock of their rotation depth. https://t.co/HRgxyfs1ot
Fedde works a scoreless first on 14 pitches.
Fedde starts the evening with two strikeouts.
Guys, I don’t actually think this is happening. https://t.co/QEtyyuQVK2
Michael A. is taking ground balls at short. I would say don’t read into that, but this year has taught me that entropy always wins and chaos always reigns so who knows.
Hellickson will throw a sim game soon, too. Martinez said they’ll figure out his spot when he’s healthy.
The field at Nationals Park is literally steaming post rain storm.
Doolittle’s velo was down in his sim game Sunday, so he is going to throw another tomorrow. They want to make sure he’s mechanically sound.
Joe Ross will make his season debut Friday, Martinez said.
McGowin and Voth will pitch out of the bullpen. Davey said they also moved Rodriguez to the bullpen to limit his innings, which have jumped dramatically this year.
McGowin trained with Tim Lincecum this offseason, and that helped with his changeup. Also worked on the mental side. Said he noticed a big difference in both.
Robles said the injury hasn’t made him stop diving and running around and things like that. Thinks the front office was worried it might.
Thunder and lightning at Nationals Park right now. So #2018.
Another note on those roster moves: Tommy Milone was activated off the DL, but transferred to the Syracuse roster. So he's not active.
Jeremy Hellickson is throwing a bullpen right now.
Nats tonight. Nothing crazy. https://t.co/xF1wLNcGOc
As expected, Nats call up and activate Robles, Sanchez, Voth, McGowin, Ross, Fedde.
Cardinals switch up their starters so Gant will pitch against Fedde tonight and Mikolas against Roark tomorrow.
Ryan Zimmerman is the Nats Clemente Award nominee.

Harper said his body isn’t feeling very well, but he’s trying to push through it. Can hear it in his voice that he’s not doing well.
Harper’s sac fly provides a nice win for the Nationals, who are 69-69.
...but not there. Pops out to first. One down. https://t.co/CljTOoxsvH
Now Eaton beats out a bunt hit that moves Taylor to third. Runners on the corners, no one out for Turner, who just needs to get a ball in the air.
It's Reynolds. https://t.co/3nvjfFyB3P
Grace hits one to the wall in right center, where Munoz loses the battle with the sun monster and gives the Nats the winning run in scoring position with no one out. Taylor will pinch run.
Reynolds will pinch hit to start the 10th.
Looks like Shreve will stay out there to start the bottom of the 10th.
Holland strikes him out. To the bottom of the 10th we go. PH, Eaton, Turner.
The lefty Grace has been warming for some time. Looks like they'll stay with Holland to face the lefty Carpenter.
Holland gets a DP ball. Two down.
Holland walks the leadoff man in the 10th.
Holland will start the 10th.
Wieters strikes out to end the inning. To the 10th we go...
Difo comes back from 0-2 to work a walk. Wieters with two out and the bases loaded.
Norris is done. Cardinals will bring in lefty Chasen Shreve to face Difo. Reynolds is on the bench and so is Taylor. But Difo will hit.
Now Zimmerman singles, so Difo gets a chance for redemption with two on and two out.
Call stands. They rule Rendon out. Two down in the bottom of the ninth.
They'll review the catch there. Nats challenged.
Harper hits a 3-1 fastball out to dead center. His 31st of the season. Tie game.
@NatsGal @MarkZuckerman @dougherty_jesse We have asked. Can't sit Soto (RoY contender playing too well). Can't sit Harper (He's Harper). Eaton playing well, too. Would imagine Robles will get more chances than Taylor down the stretch, too. Just the reality of their OF.
Eaton walks to start the ninth.
I don't care if your complaints about a bullpen cart are justified. I care that you feel the best use of your time is to write 280 characters about those feelings on a sunny day on Labor Day Weekend. https://t.co/VgjZr5YHGR
Nats have one last chance, and it'll come against Norris in the ninth.
We've reached the point in this wonderful season at which we are getting angry tweets about the existence of the bullpen cart. This, I think, says it all.
Wieters is clearly not too banged up to catch a couple innings, though the Nats are being careful with him as he's dealing with a hip/groin problem.
Stevenson strikes out to end the inning. Holland will get the ninth.
Wieters strikes out. Stevenson gets a shot now with two out.
Wilmer Difo ends up with a double when Bader's diving try comes up just short. He's there with one out for Wieters, who will pinch hit for Severino.
Zimmerman hits a 100 mph sinker, which I imagine isn't easy, but hits it to short for the first out.
Jordan Hicks, hard thrower, will pitch the bottom of the eighth.
Miller strikes out Ozuna and gets out of the bases loaded, no out jam. Nats head to the bottom of the eighth down by two.
Justin Miller gets the 4-2-3 DP ball.
Cardinals load the bases with no out against Cordero in the eighth. Martinez, desperate to keep the deficit to two, will bring in Miller.
Cordero hits Wisdom, who takes second without a throw.
Cordero takes over for Scherzer. Max went seven innings, struck out 11 and walked one, three runs on four hits.
Soto swings at the first pitch and grounds out. So there goes that.
Rendon swings at the first pitch and hits a fly ball to right. So it'll be up to Soto with two down.
Harper walks. Nats have another chance to tie it with two on and one out in the seventh.
Turner walks and Harper comes to bat as the tying run.
3-1. Ugh I know, I know. https://t.co/ksimV7J65P
Scherzer works a 1-2-3 seventh. He's at 105 pitches and 11 strikeouts. Dominant since that first inning. Still trails 2-1.
Scherzer struck out 10 again. That's the 15th time this season, 79th of his career, most among active pitchers. But you knew that.
Scherzer strikes out swinging. He'll take his time getting out there for the top of the seventh.
Brebbia throws one in on Scherzer, who had to spin out of the way and didn't look happy.
Severino strikes out looking and Scherzer will hit for himself with two down.
Scherzer is in the on-deck circle.
Rough day for Difo, who strikes out for the third time today.
Cordero is warming for the Nats.
Flaherty done after five innings.
Scherzer's at 95 pitches through six. Had an extra day, so he might be able to go one more, though his spot is due in the bottom of the inning.
Munoz hits an 0-2 fastball out to right center. Weird.
Zimmerman hits one just short of the track in left and the Nats leave 'em loaded again.
Cardinals will intentionally walk Soto to get to Zimmerman.
Here comes Mike Maddux for another #moundvisit.
Now Rendon hits one into the left field corner. Harper has to stop at third, but the Nats have two in scoring position for Soto with two out.
Harper draws a two-out walk. He leads the N.L. with 100 BB
Scherzer has retired 12 straight Cardinals. Trails 2-1.
After 4, Cardinals 2, Nats 1.
Neither Difo nor Severino can get Zimmerman over. Up to Scherzer to keep things going with two down.
Zimmerman singles up the middle to start the fourth. He's been on base twice.
Scherzer works a scoreless fourth. He's at 70 pitches.
Scherzer has recorded 10 outs, eight via strikeout.
Soto strikes out to end the third. 2- Cardinals.
Rendon, hit by a pitch, steals second base. Just his second steal of the season, which surprises me actually.
Scherzer has seven strikeouts through three innings. It's taken 57 pitches. He and Nats trail 2-1.
Scherzer gets Carpenter to go on a cutter and he's through two on 42 pitches. Five strikeouts. Nats trail 2-1.
Bader steals second as Scherzer strikes out Peña. All four outs via strikeout.
Bader starts the second with a single to left. Scherzer has already left a couple hittable breaking balls out and over today, which isn't like him.
Difo strikes out. Inning over. Nats made Flaherty work, but only get one back.
Flaherty struggling here. Has walked three of the last four to load the bases to Difo. Time for a Mike Maddux #moundvisit
Trea Turner homers. His 17th. 2-1.
It took 25 pitches, but Scherzer is through the first with three strikeouts. Cardinals 2, Nats 0.
In other news, Scherzer has now struck out 250 batters for five straight seasons, second-longest streak in MLB history. Only Randy Johnson (six) has better.
Scherzer hangs a slider to DeJong who brings home two. 2-0 Cardinals.
Wow. Scherzer balks. I'm not sure I've ever seen him balk.
Scherzer walks Adams. Two on, one out.
Count went full, but Scherzer struck out Carpenter before surrendering a first-pitch single to Munoz. Not gets Adams, who receives a nice ovation.
Nats' 2017 first-rounder Seth Romero underwent Tommy John surgery, a disappointing end to a rough year for the lefty. https://t.co/aWoN2rSvgk
Nats have renewed their contracts with Potomac and Hagerstown, both through the 2020 season. The search for a Class AAA affiliate should pick up (and get its resolution) soon, now that seasons are over.
Martinez seemed determined to find time for the young guys. Acknowledged this will make it hard to find time for Michael A. Taylor. https://t.co/g68Bo3PTgi
Martinez on Robles in September: “I wanna see him play.” Minor league season’s end today, so expect call-ups tomorrow. And expect Robles to be among them.
Joe Ross will be active tomorrow. He could start soon, Davey said.
Another big blow to their minor league pitching depth. https://t.co/VxuuNaKYbA
@Todd_Dybas mentioned this first.
Nats confirm 2017 first round pick Seth Romero underwent Tommy John last week. Dr. El Attrache in Los Angeles.
Nothing crazy today for Nats. https://t.co/eNenxU0Xwd
Matt Adams is playing first, batting third today against Scherzer.
Tim Collins asked if warning then sitting then warming led to his uncharacteristic lack of command:  “I don’t think it was anything getting up or sitting down that affected me.” Said nothing is normal for a reliever. Said he just didn’t execute.
As for Collins, plan all along was for him to get the top of the order if it came to that. He sat, but Martinez said he was fully ready.
So Suero, Grace, and Cordero were all unavailable and they wanted to stay away from Glover. Hence Martinez pushing Rodriguez longer. Thought he could get through bottom of the order with two out.
Nats fall, 9-4. They're 68-69.
To the bottom of the ninth we go. Nats trail by five.
Nothing for the Nats in the eighth. Glover will get the ninth.
Nothing for the Nats in the bottom of the seventh. Solis gets the eighth.
Turner singles through the right side. Zimmerman will pinch hit with two on and one out.
Williams has worked two scoreless innings in his big league debut. Much-needed for the Nats.
Williams, recently a starter, will get a second inning here.
Williams works a scoreless inning. Two strikeouts. Impressive breaking ball.
Williams strikes out Broxton, too.
Williams strikes out Moustakas to start his big league career. Gets him with that curve/slurve thing.
Austen Williams throws strike one, which is an achievement for pitchers on both sides today.
Stevenson will take over for Harper in center in a double switch .
Austen Williams will make his big league debut. in the sixth.
Rodriguez allowed seven runs on seven hits and walked seven.
Collins gets a fly ball to end the inning. But that was one of the easiest sequences to second-guess this season -- made easier, of course, because it went so poorly.
Collins isn't right. He's thrown 12 pitches, 10 balls. Have to think the rush contributed since we've just never seen this from him.
And now Yelich hits a 3-0 pitch out to dead center. It's 9-4. Wow.
Collins has thrown six straight balls.
Now Collins walks Perez on four pitches, which makes you wonder about his readiness. Maybe it's unrelated.
Now the runners advance on a wild pitch.
Not sure how much time Collins needs. He might have been ready when he sat down, so only needed a few more. Plus, he gets pitches on the mound now. But that all happened fast.
Walked him on four pitches. Martinez will come get him, and go to Collins, who just got up again.
Rodriguez behind the pitcher 3-0.
Had Collins warming, but once Rodriguez got through the lefties, Williams started. Not sure if he's ready, though he should be by now. https://t.co/yhHwR6nIp6
Now Arcia hits a first-pitch single, and Martinez will stick with Rodriguez to face the pitcher.
Broxton hits a 2-0 fastball out to dead center. Harper hardly moved. It's 5-4 Brewers.
Austen Williams is warming now.
Rodriguez knocks down that ground ball. I think if he hadn't, that might have ended the inning. Runners on the corners, two out for Broxton.
Nevermind. One pitch for the out.
Thames hits a one-out double, and now has to get by Moustakas before the bottom of the order is due. First base is open, if they need it. Collins warming.
Rodriguez will hit for himself, so looks like he'll get a chance to get through five here.
Guerra is done after the Nats get to him for four runs in three innings.
Rodriguez at 82 pitches through four, but he now leads 4-2. We'll see how long Martinez is willing to stick with him. Heart of the order due in the fifth for Milwaukee.
Difo grounds out, but the Nats rally to take a lead.
Reynolds singles up the middle. Two runs score. It's 4-2.
Juan Soto singles up the middle. Tie game. #SotoMayor
Eaton gets a hit on that one, which is generous, but I'm sure he doesn't mind.
@KyleBrostowitz @ThomasBoswellWP he does now!
Rendon bails out Rodriguez with a great charging play to end the top of the third. He's thrown 67 pitches in three innings.
Rodriguez has walked three straight to load the bases for Broxton.
You know it's a Sunday in September when @ThomasBoswellWP spins his laptop around and says "Have you ever seen a picture of Three-Finger Brown's hand?" 		I had not.
By the way, Reynolds starting today just to give Zim a rest. I thought Zimmerman might have rolled his ankle getting out of his way of that pitch at his head last night, but he said other than seeing his life pass before his eyes, he is fine.
Difo homers. It's 2-1.
RT @PostSports: Erick Fedde will start for the Nationals Tuesday, and Sean Doolittle is nearing a return https://t.co/KeL3l7t72g
Turner able to double up Guerra with ease there, so Rodriguez is through a scoreless second.
Soto drifts back on that one and can't quite get there, so Guerra has a one-out double off the wall in left.
Harper hits one off the first base bag for a two-out single.
The two walks score, but no one else does. Rodriguez works a 26-pitch first.
Moustakas takes a two-strike curve the other way and brings home two.
Rodriguez issues two straight walks to start this one.
Rodriguez walks Granderon on four pitches to start the game.
They’ll see how he’s doing tomorrow (the always-crucial day after) but then make a decision. https://t.co/oo5tR75eIE
Martinez thinks Doolittle could be back this week.
Kelvin Herrera underwent surgery on his foot Thursday. All went well.
Fedde will start Tuesday, Davey said. So Max, Fedde, Roark.
Nats have listed Tuesday’s starter as TBA. Scherzer tomorrow, Roark Wednesday.
Doolittle said today was an improvement on his last sim game. Doesn’t know what’s next, but the foot felt fine.
Zim sits today. Eaton RF, Turner SS, Harper CF, Rendon 3B, Soto LF,  Reynolds 1B, Difo 2B, Kieboom C, Rodriguez P
Doolittle is out for a sim game. Looks like he’ll face Stevenson with Davey looking on from a few feet behind him.

And suddenly the whole night was worth it. https://t.co/cWBdFBfj56
Juan Soto on what he’s done to get things going at the plate after a brief slump: 		“Just keep doing Juan Soto things.”
Strasburg said he’s been working on shortening his stride, not jumping out too much. Thinks it’s helping and started to pay off tonight. Martinez seemed to feel better about Strasburg’s stuff, too.
In The End, the Nationals won 5-4.
Aguilar bloops a hit to center, which will bring up Shaw with two out.
Saladino homers. It's 5-4. I'm out of puns.
I think Zimmerman felt something as he got out of the way of that ball. Might have twisted his ankle. But the run scores so it's 5-3.
Soto singles up the middle. The Nationals have a 4-3 lead. Raise Your Glass.
Rendon walks. Here comes Soto, Counsell will come get Soria and bring in in the lefty now. Would be Foolish not to.
Harper walks. This inning starting to look like the Brewers' Kryptonite.
Turner bloops one into short left, and it's 3-2. Harper now. He'd be the go-ahead run.
Eaton doubles into the left field corner to keep things going in the eighth, not quite the Nats' Last Resort, but almost.
Stevenson will pinch hit for Kieboom, then Wieters in the pitcher's spot.
Zimmerman just made an outstanding over-the-shoulder catch to hold the Brewers where they are. A Dynamite play.
Holland walks Granderon after he slips and bounces one. Blame It on the rain.
Brewers counter with the lefty Granderson, which means they turn Right Round and get a good late-game PH matchup anyway.
A pitching change one batter after 1:57 minutes of rain delay confirms my suspicions that we are living in Disturbia.
Now Martinez will go get Grace and bring in Greg Holland with two outs.
Runners on first and second. One out. The rain delay was 1:57 minutes.
Grace is running to the mound. Take A Bow everyone. You've made it through the rain delay.
Nats now say we'll start again at 11:45. At least the tarp is off now.

Tarp coming off because that rain that moved over the ballpark but hasn't been falling for 15 minutes has apparently subsided.
Also, the rain seems to have stopped now. #2018.
Nats say rain has moved back over the ballpark and they'll update again in 15 minutes. I mean Grace was literally warming up. Whoever's call that is, it can't happen.
Grace is in the bullpen. Crew waiting by the tarp, but it has not moved. For a game that is supposed to restart in seven minutes, that seems to be a problem.
Just kidding. Tarp still on. They faked me out.

Meanwhile, this tweet made me laugh harder than I've laughed in a long time, in large part because I see parallels between myself and this ambitious animal. https://t.co/k1QzRW10cI
To anyone who for some reason is still reading these on the Saturday night of Labor Day Weekend: Should I start opening to random pages in the Nats 2018 media guide and tweeting the most random fact I find?
Because Every Time We Touch this subject somebody rants needlessly: MLB controls what happens to this game tonight. Brewers' last trip here, so it's in the league's control.
Even Mr. Brightside would have trouble thinking this will be a quick delay. https://t.co/3IHnshtQty
Here comes the tarp. I'll be testing the Big Girls Don't Cry theory now.
If they don't stop this soon, somebody might lose someone Irreplaceable. Field is drenched. Martinez and Lessard are out to check on Suero, who took a line drive off the leg, then almost slipped near first.
Suero looks like he's about to Lose Control here. Struggling to hit spots, walks Shaw on four pitches.
I would walk A Thousand Miles if it would put a roof on this place.
I Gotta Feeling we aren't gonna make it through tonight. Rain starting to come down much harder now.
Umps saying "So What" to the rain, letting this one continue through some rain and lightning. Word is more rain coming later. Trying to get this in.
Rain Drops of Jupiter are falling now.
Collins inherits the jam, but maintains his Poker Face. Gets the ground ball to keep the deficit at two.
Martinez will go get Collins for Yelich with the rain coming fast enough that they're closing the windows. If anyone goes insane because of rain this year, It's Gonna Be Me.
(Either you think I'm referencing the Britney Spears song "3" or you think I forgot a pun here. Don't Matter.) https://t.co/Ev0A6Acq3E
Pina hits a solo shot. 3-1.
Strasburg is done. Cordero will relieve him. Six innings. No earned runs. Seven strikeouts. Probably his best outing since returning from the disabled list. Change-up was the Money Maker again. Velo was better, if not totally back to normal.
Ugh am I really going to need my Umbrella AGAIN? https://t.co/Nj7Xuxj9R8
Tonight has turned into a Nats Family Affair as Xavier Cedeno just entered this game for the Brewers.
Strasburg works a quick and easy sixth. He's at 93 pitches. It' Been Awhile since we've seen him go longer than six. June 1, actually.
Strasburg taps one in front of home plate and he'll start the sixth. Already seemed to be tiring in the fifth, and he won't get much chance to Breathe between innings. He's taking his time taking the mound here.
Zimmerman thought umps were Crazy for not signaling sooner about whether Yelich caught that ball, but I'm not sure he scores even if he tags. Two down for Strasburg, who will stay.
Everything sort of happened in Slow Motion there, but Difo's ground ball got by Aguilar, as did a throw back to the infield which allowed Zim to take third. Nats cut the deficit in half. Strasburg out on deck.
Matt Grace will Get Busy in the bullpen. Strasburg at 83 pitches through five, but was visibly tired in that fifth.
Soto hesitated before heading for third on Zimmerman's single, which could have been Toxic, but slides in safely. Nats have runners on the corners. Best chance of the night.
(He didn't start the fifth. There's one out. I'm an American Idiot.) https://t.co/4a1P6yFzqV
Soto starts the fifth with a single to right. He's hitting .297, something I do not imagine you were doing When You Were Young.
Not exactly The Great Escape, but Strasburg does hold the Brewers to two in that inning. Both runs unearned.
Yelich steals second uncontested. Two in scoring position with two out now.
Bad Day for the Nationals defense as Eaton struggles to come up with that single and it allows Cain to take third. Brewers lead 2-0.
Velo is Fallin, though. 92 now.
Strasburg could Use Somebody to give him a break here, and he got one there as Anderson pops the bunt foul with two strikes for the first out.
I Don't Want To Be too critical, as that would have been a tough play for Turner, but two plays that could have been made now have Strasburg in a two-on, no-out jam with the pitcher up. Turner had been shifted toward second. Probably makes that normally.
Now Rendon gets all Caught Up by that high hop and makes an error that allows the first run of the game to score. Brewers lead 1-0.
Things get Complicated for Strasburg in the fifth. Moustakas leads off with a double into the right field corner.
Nats get no Closer to scoring, as Harper hits into an inning-ending DP. Scoreless through four.
Do You Realize that was the Nationals' first hit of the night? Turner comes through with a one-out single to left in the fourth.
Strasburg will Walk Away from that inning unscathed after he strikes out Braun to end it. 59 pitches through four, which is a solid pace.
Until this inning, Strasburg was having no trouble commanding his stuff Whenever, Wherever. Now he's walked two of the last three, I think struggling a bit with sweat on pitching hand.
I know it seems like we're Obsessed with Stras's velo, but it's something everyone has noticed -- and dips like his rarely mean nothing. To see him tick back to 95 is reassuring.
Meanwhile, Strasburg's velocity is getting a little Better in Time. He's hit 95 this inning.
Change to Yelich was Low so Strasburg issues his first walk of the evening with one out in the fourth.
Strasburg looked like he wanted the Nats to check the Replay on that double play ball. He thinks he beat it. They won't. Scoreless through three.
Strasburg Floats On through the third. He's at 26 pitches through three scoreless. Two K's. One hit.
Schoop went One ,Two Steps too far off first, so Turner doubles him up on that line drive. Two down.
Schoop drops a bloop into right, and someone has a hit in this game For The First Time.
Not gonna say you'd be bored up here Without Me but.... https://t.co/VRTYvBCIDt
Nats go Down in order in the second. We're scoreless through two.
@Todd_Dybas Just Dance, man.
No One touches Strasburg in the second. He strikes out the side.
The diminished velocity (94) didn't present any Dilemma there. Strasburg freezes Braun with a fastball on the outside corner for the second out.
Strasburg change comes in like a Wrecking ball to Shaw, who swings over it for the first out of the second.
Heads Will Roll if anyone tries. A baseball game qualifies as a relative Party in the USA these days. Not gonna Apologize for enjoying it now and then. https://t.co/NCyKvZivIP
Oh yes we are. We Can't Stop. https://t.co/Y3Q8bVhaW1
Seven pitches in a scoreless first for Strasburg, whose fastball sat at 93 -- plenty fast for Chasing Cars, but not his norm.
Sorry, was in The Middle of something up here. But this game is underway as of about 4 Minutes ago, and Strasburg is two outs in.
I guess I don't have as much of a sample for comparison, but it sure feels like this fan base is more... forgiving? has lasting appreciation?... for the guys who spend a lot of time here. They claim them forever, and always seem happy when they return.
Now Gio comes out and tips his cap to the crowd. Quirky as always. He tips his cap to the Nats dugout.
I don't know if he was out there for the tribute. I didn't see him come up and acknowledge it. Kind of a weird moment.
Gio is getting a standing ovation.

I was undecided on 2000s puns for 2000s night tonight. Then they played It’s Gonna Be Me during BP and it was over. We’re gonna do this One More Time.
Hellickson threw a bullpen, threw a few curveballs, and should throw another in a few days. Doolittle scheduled to throw another sim game tomorrow.
Nats wanted Severino sooner than later because Wieters is still bothered by a hip/groin issue that caused him trouble in Philly.
Austen Williams will wear 53. Said he’s really benefited from the move to the bullpen. Focusing on fastball/curve (but it’s slider-ish).
Wieters sits Saturday. https://t.co/jVKIdX9YuM
Tarp is on. September baseball begins in fitting fashion.
Nats have made their first two call-ups: Severino and recently converted reliever Austen Williams, a 25-year-old righty with a 1.19 ERA.
Nats are planning to honor Gio before tonight’s game, and are hoping fans will get there early for it.

Gio teared up talking about the deal. He walked in wearing a Brewers hat and sweatshirt. It was weird.
@FirstGLG20 This was about the Madson deal and also, have you ever met him?

Now Eaton singles. It's legit thunderstorming.
Grace works a scoreless top of the ninth. They're going to try to push through this.
Harper got a bad jump there but navigated the rain to make the play and get the first out. Eaton struggles too.
They're going to try to play through this, though it's coming down pretty hard.
Rain really picking up here as Grace takes the mound for the ninth.
Kieboom grounds out. Nats get nothing. To the ninth we go, Brewers: 4, Nats: 1, Rain: scaring me.
Zimmerman hits into a double play. Two down, runner at third.
Now it's raining. Fans scampering for cover.
Rendon's single and Soto's walk bring Zimmerman to the plate as the tying run with no one out in the eighth.
Soto thinks he hit Kratz's glove on that swing, but it's ruled a foul ball.
Jimmy Cordero just threw a three-pitch inning. Expecto patronum.
It's Cordero to start the eighth. I was misled.
Harper lined out. Now Harper is exchanging words with the crew chief and waves him off on his way out to the outfield. Suero will pitch the eighth as the umps get a look at the radar. https://t.co/XCSgW44PI6
Bryce Harper and Dan Jennings are staging a battle for the ages.

Jennings balks Turner to second and now everyone will be indignant and meanwhile the rain charges toward us like a dementor threatening to suck our souls.
That'll do it for Chacin.
Glover works a scoreless seventh. I have been informed rain is coming, and I would like to politely request we skip the seventh-inning stretch as a result.
RT @JeffPassan: Sources: Josh Donaldson has been told he's been traded to the Cleveland Indians.
Glover takes over for Roark. Kieboom will catch because Wieters was, indeed, ejected.
I think Wieters got tossed for his displeasure with the strike zone. Always hard to tell up here until they announce it, but that seems to be what happened.
Davey is out and arguing vehemently here. He's not happy. Clapped his hands hard at home plate ump Chad Whitson and said "Let's (Bleeping) go."
Roark has settled in, retired 11 of last 12 since the third homer. He's at 95 pitches. Nats still in it, trailing 4-1 in the sixth.
After five, Brewers lead 4-1.
@Official_JBurke just assume I've always experienced far creepier in this job
...or not. Who knows anything anymore. Two on, two out for Roark.
Soto called out at home, but I bet the Nats will challenge this one.

Quick fourth for Roark, who's at 68 pitches and trails 4-1.
Roark's late-July start against the Brewers was the one that turned it all around. His next start against them (this one, for the distracted) is the first time he's allowed four runs or more since July 13.
Off goes Gio Gonzalez in the move that makes it all feel realer somehow. https://t.co/5ckTcnM4Sq
@Official_JBurke Same
Now Aguilar hits a 3-2 pitch way out to left. Roark's allowed three homers in three innings, which isn't in keeping with his recent success.
Kratz homers. 3-1 Brewers.
Nats get one back in the first. Brewers lead 2-1 in a game that suddenly doesn't feel all that important by comparison.
Rendon beats out that ground ball so the Nats get a run back in the first.
Shaw hits a two-run shot to dead center as the MASN cameras show Gio Gonzalez hanging with Stephen Strasburg and Erick Fedde in the dugout. What a world.
Say what you want about Gio (you probably already have now and then) but only five pitchers in baseball have made more starts since 2012. He was on the disabled list once since Nats acquired him.
You knew this because @Ken_Rosenthal isn't wrong, but do have confirmation now that Nats sent Gio Gonzalez to the Brewers. He's been a staple. This is the move that really drives home the point: This band is breaking up.
Have not gotten confirmation of the Gonzalez deal, but it makes sense. He's owed about $2 million more, by my calculations, but no word yet on how much of that Nats would be paying.
Nats holding a moment of silence for John McCain.

That being said, super pumped to have @dougherty_jesse on board the rest of the way. If you haven’t figured it out already, he’s going to be awesome.
Incidentally, because I haven’t said so, an overdue thanks to @jorgecastillo for putting up with me these last two years. Incredibly hard worker and super teammate. Only knock is be never publicly admitted his propensity for making dumb puns, but it’s real.
The post @jorgecastillo era is going well. https://t.co/6AYJSBu4AE
Player incentives count, and obviously those haven't been calculated. Award bonuses count, and those aren't clear yet. Player benefit costs count, and they have a lot of shuffling to do. It's not just salary. Not even close. https://t.co/wUW43CbTGY
Probably alarmist, but what else do you have to do today but speculate wildly? https://t.co/NqDmwRDjfv
So I didn't see Gio out shagging fly balls during BP with the other pitchers, but that might not mean anything. He did a big stair workout in the heat earlier, and looked exhausted afterward. But given today's context/fact that he cleared waivers, feels worth noting.
If that’s true, this is all saving money. But given holes they have to fill this offseason, ownership’s history of meticulousness when it comes to vetting even smallish deals, the $12-13 million they’ve saved matters. And helps pay off the luxury tax penalty, which’ll be minimal https://t.co/0P8UR3sdfK
My understanding is that Nats front office does NOT expect to get under the luxury tax threshold with these deals. No one seems totally sure, and it’s a weird calculation, but general consensus is that they’re not going to get there.
Harper still battling his cough, Martinez said. But he’s in there.
Doolittle threw 15 pitches in his sim game, and he said he felt good. Execution was off, but if no new problems pop up he will throw another Sunday or Monday.
Martinez said he was surprised by the Madson deal. Wasn’t expecting it. Can tell it takes a toll on him to see these guys go.

Nats just announced it, too. Solis takes Madson’s spot.
Dodgers have officially announced the deal, confirming the return is RHP Andrew Istler.
Wouldn’t rule out further moves from the Nats today. Gonzalez and Wieters seem like the most enticing pieces for contenders.

I believe @Ken_Rosenthal mentioned this first.

RT @jorgecastillo: I can now say I've sat next to @ThomasBoswellWP during a Nick Jonas concert. What a sendoff.
Scherzer on the deadline deals, which he hadn't spoken about yet: "It's frustrating. But it’s also been a frustrating season for us as whole. It is what it is."
Surprisingly, it is somewhat difficult to write a game story during a Nick Jonas concert.
Davey said Madson is going to meet the Nats in New York. Doesn’t think he’ll need much time if he is feeling better.
Nats fall 2-0. They’re 64-64.
Neshek will pitch the ninth for Philly.
Greg Holland strikes out the side in the ninth, so there's that.
Nola gets Harper with a fastball. That's what happens when they have to think about that curveball. Nothing for the Nats in the eighth.
They're going to let Nola face Harper.
Turner walks. Here comes Harper with two out. He's the go-ahead run. Neshek is warming, we'll see if they stall and somehow get him in this game.
Eaton provides a two-out double to give the Nationals some life in the eighth. No one warming for the Phillies. Nola at 91 pitches.
Suero works a scoreless eighth as Kieboom throws out Hernandez trying to steal. To the bottom of the eighth, Phillies 2, Nationals 0.
Scherzer done. Suero in.
Difo sent one to the track in left, but it wasn't enough. To the eighth, Phillies 2, Nats 0.
Reynolds hits a two-out double, so he's on with two out for Difo.
Suero is up in the bullpen. He threw 35 pitches yesterday. Davey said Grace was supposed to be down yesterday and pitched anyway, so he is probably unavailable. They're probably pretty short-handed today.
Like, no one would ever feel anything but decent entering the bottom of the seventh ever. https://t.co/wGjPtMhQRD
I vote for I Wanna Dance With Somebody as the perpetual seventh inning song and I will not hear a word against it. Don't @ me.
Scherzer strikes out Nola for his 10th strikeout of the day. He's thrown 109 pitches.
Herrera hits a two-run shot on a 2-0 cutter. 2-0 Phillies.
This is Scherzer's first four-walk game since September of last year.
Scherzer walks Franco, his fourth walk of the day.
Nothing for the Nats in the sixth. To the seventh we go, tied at 0.
Scherzer's through six on 90 pitches. Eight strikeouts. Just that one almost-error for a hit.
Scherzer somehow got the barrel on a curve. The line drive stayed up for an out, but that's pretty impressive.
Scherzer works around the trouble. 79 pitches through five innings.
Scorer rules that a base hit. 4 1/3 innings had tied Scherzer's longest no-hit bid of the year.
Nothing for the Nats in the bottom of the fourth.
Soto drives a high fly ball to left center and it falls at the track. Two out.
Rendon singles through the right side and the Nats have a one-out baserunner in the fourth.
Relatively quick inning for Scherzer, who's now at 62 pitches through four innings.
Turner hits a line drive that stays up just a bit too long. Nothing for the Nats. Scoreless through three.
Eaton strikes out. Up to Turner with two out.
Scherzer gets the bunt down on the first pitch. Kieboom to third. In a game like this, that's big.
Kieboom jumps on Nola's first pitch and hits a double into the left field corner.
Scherzer through three scoreless on 52 pitches. Soto just catches up to Hoskins's line drive.
Scherzer works a scoreless second. He's at 35 pitches through two.
Don’t freak out about Zimmerman. Everybody goes on waivers. Gio and Wieters, as impending free agents, more interesting. https://t.co/P6l3ldnpLG
This is the best thing ever. https://t.co/tYYEuYWqY7
Turner bunts for a one-out single.
Scherzer through a scoreless first on 17 pitches.
To 313 and others who just sang me that song... AMAZING. The highest honor. I think it was in tune, too!
“Thank you sir...or ma’am?” https://t.co/usfthpte4r
Screech came to say goodbye to @jorgecastillo. https://t.co/BEYqwwMGNp
Hellickson has been able to throw a little, but the wrist is still too sore to get any kind of torque needed to throw breaking balls, etc. Thinks he can get back before season ends, but wrist needs time to heal. Not in a splint or anything.
Nats today. Zimmerman rests. https://t.co/JrcA2ILwdE
RT @PostSports: Ryan Zimmerman hit a two-run walk-off homer Wednesday night, and the Nationals moved back above .500 https://t.co/uGqcVwU1gx
Soto on Zim: “He never gives up and I’m here with him. If he doesn’t give up, then I don’t.”
Juan Soto on his excitement level when they called that a homer: “Too much.”
Zimmerman on what he said to Soto when he saw him charging after him: “Get away. I don’t even know the rules but get away.” 		(Zimmerman would have been out if Soto touched him)
Neither seemed concerned about him physically. Guess we will know for sure five days from now. https://t.co/9fZmuoynXW
Davey said Strasburg just got tired, hence the velo drop. Strasburg blamed endurance too. Said he felt fine, just hasn’t been out there in awhile. So, there you have it.
Zimmerman wins it on a walk-off. Why not. Still not quite dead yet.
Soto sneaks one just inside the right field line for a two-out double. It’s up to Zimmerman.
RT @PostSports: @chelsea_janes Ask for Bohemian Rhapsody
Grace strikes out Bour. To the bottom of the ninth we go. Nats down one.
This is the best thing ever. https://t.co/qhymNvTxeQ
The wonderful people in the section below us have just offered to sing me something and I have truly never been more honored.
Grace will come in to pitch to Bour with the bases loaded and two out.
It strikes me that yelling absurdities in a half-empty, largely quiet stadium is the original Twitter.
Cordero walks Hoskins. Bases loaded and we will get a #moundvisit.
Difo gets one out on the chopper. Runners on the corners with one out.
Pace of play: intolerable.
Cordero has gotten two of the weakest ground balls a guy can get and he’s in a two on, no out jam.
Nats get just the one run in the eighth. Cordero will get the ninth.
Stevenson hits a fly ball to center to score a run. 7-6 Phillies.
Difo triples to start the eighth.
Stevenson on deck to pinch hit for Holland.
Holland works a scoreless eighth.
Nothing for the Nationals in the seventh. They trail by two heading to the eighth. Holland coming in.
Collins gets Bour looking. He’s not happy about the call. At the stretch, Phillies 7, Nats 5.
Martinez will go get Miller and bring in the lefty Collins to face Bour.
Hernandez hits one into the second deck. 7-5.
Nothing for the Nats in the sixth. Looks like Miller will get the seventh.
Harper just misses one, hits a fly ball to center and fires his bat to the side in frustration.
Hunter throws it away trying to keep Turner close and the Nats have the tying run in scoring position with one out.
Suero through the sixth. Allows one run. Nats trail 6-5 heading to the bottom of the inning.
Santana doubles. 6-5.
Strasburg done after four innings. He threw 84 pitches. Allowed five runs on seven hits.
Eflin is done. Nobody takes this as consolation I’m sure, but this Nats team really does fight back regularly. Hasn’t yielded the necessary results as often as required, but it’s real.
Harper steals second. Throw gets away. Turner scores. Tie game.
Harper is 3 for 3. Nats in business again in the fourth.
Strasburg gets a DP ball to end the fourth. He’s at 84 pitches. Would not be surprised if that’s it for him.
Another hit for the Phillies. It’s 5-4.
Strasburg is shaking his arm between pitches.
Davey is noticing the velo drop, too. Suero is throwing in the fourth.
Alfaro just singled on a 92 mph change. Strasburg’s fastball is currently 93.
Wieters singles and the game is tied.
Soto singles. Harper scores. 4-3
With Turner going, Harper hits one into the right field corner for an RBI double. 4-2.
Strasburg works through the third. He's at 62 pitches.
Bour hits one out to deep center on a 93 mph fastball. Velo continues to be a little down, enough to make you wonder. 4-1.
Difo doubles with two outs in the second.
Strasburg works a 1-2-3 second on 11 pitches.
RT @hbgsensradio: .@JoeRoss21 done for the night. He went 5ip 4h 3r 3er 6k 0bb 60-47 and allowed a 2-run HR. He looked pretty good for bein…
Strasburg has recorded all four outs via strikeout. Velo at 93-95, not his usual 95-97.
Soto strikes out looking to end the inning. It's happened a lot lately. Wonder if he's noticing a changing zone due to his demonstrative reactions.
Rendon doubles. Harper scores. 3-1 Phillies.
Harper bunts around the shift for a two-out single.
Strasburg allows three runs on four hits on 31 pitches in the first.
Now Williams singles.
Franco homers on a 3-2 pitch and it's 3-0.
Bour doubles and Eaton slips trying to pick it up. Looks ok, but it looked back initially. He's up and moving.
Two up, two down looking at curveballs for strike three.
I have been notified that those responsible for the Amazing Grace sing along when Matt Grace singled late last night were not, in fact, intoxicated. I am impressed.
Strasburg's first pitch is a 95 mph strike and we're underway.
Here comes Stephen Strasburg and the Washington Nationals.

Stevenson and Sanchez drove here from Syracuse. Sanchez had his wife and kid, so they drove separately. Got here during the rain delay. Worked out well.
Might try to make Stevenson and Difo as “the bash brothers” happen. Who’s with me!? #bashbros
Nats win 10-4. Back to .500. Long day.
Herrera gets the ninth up 10-4.
Wieters singles. It's 10-4.
Rendon doubles home the run. 8-4.
Eaton steals second as Turner strikes out, so the Nats have two cracks at another insurance run here.
Suero strikes out Quinn. Nats will carry a lead to the ninth.
