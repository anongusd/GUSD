@t3703 @WSJ Read the Joutnal piece.
@t3703 Look at my @wsj piece from the other day; there are a ton of different stats presented. I'm not picking a single figure and using a mean rather than a median. Look at my figure on the growth of incomes in the bottom 5th percentile of the retiree population.
@t3703 But you're probably rich. Retirement planning isn't as much about absolute levels of retirement income as it is about balancing your standard of living between work and retirement. There's very little evidence that most retirees can't do this.
@t3703 Note how net worths aren't really declining from age 60s to the 80s. Not what you'd expect if people entered retirement far short of what they need.
@t3703 Should be.
@t3703 Take the same Fed data and look at near-retirees, say, 10 or 15 years ago. It'll look bad, just as the data you cite do. Then use the Fed data to look at today's retirees, who are basically the same people. They'll look fine and in polls they'll tell you they're fine.
@t3703 4/ Even many who don't have ANY retirement plan do fine in retirement, and aren't even that dependent on Social Security. Think small businesses, farms. These folks should be a worst-case scenario, but today's "non-saver" retirees aren't in a crisis.	https://t.co/tT4jqfRbWu
@t3703 3/ Also: many near-retirees today didn't have a 401(k) their full career, as those plans didn't appear until 1979 and didn't become widespread until later than that. For some that's a  problem; others (about 1/2) still expect a DB pension.
@t3703 2/ There are two groups who don't need to save much: the poor (the bottom quintile gets a ~90% replacement of real, career-average earnings from Social Security), and the young, who will save more as they age. An average that includes these households will seem very low. https://t.co/COzrafgnFI
@t3703 When public employee pensions want to make their benefits seem "modest," they cite an average benefit, including those who only worked in govt for a few years and might have a plan from a different job. A similar thing is going on here. 1/
Interesting (though probably not meaningful) that retirees receive most of their income and health care from the government. https://t.co/tyKhfkGhaq

@MSFalk What happened was that Palm Beach cut its gold-plated pensions while surrounding cities didn't. So yes, firefighters would try to shift to other cities with gold-plated pensions. Does that mean we'd have no firefighters if no cities offered gold-plated pensions? No. @NYCActuary
@MUDDLAW @cate_long The legal issue on Act 80, as I understand it, was that Promesa 108 prohibited the Gov/legislature from enforcing a law contrary to the fiscal plan. Ok. But the law doesn't cease to exist, and private parties may sue in courts (which aren't mentioned in 108) to enforce Act 80.
@JRSwrites @AndrewScurria @cate_long @MUDDLAW It would be great if the Board could walk into any Member's office and get the chance to talk. But DC doesn't work that way, and all other parties have DC representation for precisely that reason. So that's where it ends up.
@cate_long @MUDDLAW My home state of Oregon spends over $50 million per year on public relations. The federal govt spends $1.5 billion. Bigger point: the Board aren't dictators, and even dictators focus where the biggest gains are. Pensions, welfare, labor laws? Big potential gains. PR contracts? No
@cate_long @MUDDLAW So the Board is supposed to decide which tourism publicity contracts the government can issue, but not micromanage? Okayyy....

@KKT_EPI We're also working longer (about 2 years since 1990) &amp; saving more. People have long worried about retirement; Gallup data show that. But fast-forward to today &amp; 8-in-10 retirees say they're living comfortably. Solutions, yes! But irrational fears aren't a good guide to policy. https://t.co/l2lAkTKkwP
@Frugal_Saver @Mitchell_JoshW @JohnCScott_DC @ORSaves Not to put too fine a point on it, but: if you assume ORSaves' original projections of around 350k non-covered workers (in firm sizes required to enroll by today) were correct, 25k actual contributors isn't a big dent in the perceived retirement savings problem.
@Mitchell_JoshW @JohnCScott_DC @ORSaves Pretty sure it does; so 28% are initially enrolled but choose to opt out. I think maybe half of those who stay in haven't contributed, but it's not clear yet why. cc'ing @Frugal_Saver, who's followed this more closely.
@JohnCScott_DC @ORSaves This gets at some of the data issues I raised the other day. By now, all firms with &gt;20 employees &amp; no plan should have enrolled their employees. According to Current Population Survey data ORSaves used, that's maybe 350k employees, but they've had only around 100k enrollments. https://t.co/7vGAt6RnwT
@reverendbob716 Sure. And you'll probably get higher benefits than today's retirees. Financed by your kids and grandkids! (I'm being flip, but honestly I don't think you have much to worry about on that front.)
@KKT_EPI Also see this piece, using Fed data, on retirees who don't have any retirement plan - the worst-case scenario. Even those "non-savers" aren't hugely dependent on Social Security, and on average can replace 90% of their pre-retirement earnings. 		https://t.co/tT4jqfRbWu
@KKT_EPI @BEA_News Most people don't (&amp; shouldn't) start saving until their 30s; that's textbook econ. And the bottom 20% of retiree receive a roughly ~90% replacement rate from Social Security, says CBO. That's a lot of zero accounts before indicating any undersaving. https://t.co/t7O0imUugh
So fix problems where they are: Social Security solvency, expand access &amp; participation in retirement plans, etc. But there’s no solid case for turning the US retirement system upside down &amp; shifting it over to government plans.
The proposed alternative is more government provision of retirement income. But government is where the retirement savings gap exists today: at least 85% of the total US retirement funding shortfall is in public sector plans, not households undersaving in theri 401(k)s.
A lot of the data used to argue for a retirement crisis aren’t great: how many workers have retirement plans; how many retirees get private retirement plan income, and how much they receive. More/better data are SORELY needed.
Are working-age households’ concerned? Yes. But more about others than about themselves. And people for years been concerned about retirement, yet it’s mostly turned out well. The difference today: activist groups stoking those fears.
The best computer models project a future challenge, not a crisis. Median replacement rates in SSA’s MINT model were 109% for Depression-era cohorts, projected at 110% for Gen Xers. The distribution of replacement rates, how many high or low, doesn’t change much either.
Even most retirees who don’t have a formal retirement plan are doing okay. (I know, it sounds nuts.) They tend to be low-income, both before &amp; after retirement. Some are business owners. But their retirement incomes match up well to pre-retirement earnings.
US retirement plan assets are much higher than the average OECD country; US retirement incomes are higher as well. Most retirees say they have enough money to live comfortably; very few call their own situation a “crisis.”
More Americans are saving for retirement; contributions as a share of paychecks are up by ¼ since 401(k)s got started; retirement plan fees falling; retirement plan assets up 6x since the 1970s; retirement incomes rising rapidly; poverty in old age falling.
Some highlights from my @WSJopinion op-ed on rising #retirement savings &amp; incomes in the US. @aeiecon	https://t.co/c9VulP198y
@KKT_EPI @BEA_News See my piece in today's @wsj for (hopefully!) some more interesting factoids. Thx.		https://t.co/c9VulP198y
@KKT_EPI @BEA_News I understand the worry. But there's not much evidence that retirees actually are running out of money. Most retirees don't even spend their full incomes (see Fed data on this), much less run out of assets. We need to put these risks into perspective.
@KKT_EPI @BEA_News I'm happy for employers to contribute more (though don't forget Social Security/Medicare taxes). But the standard economic view from SSA &amp; CBO is that employers would fund those higher contributions by paying lower wages. So it's not a freebie for employees.
@KKT_EPI @BEA_News No, I meant that employer contributions to retirement plans have risen as a percentage of employees's earnings. Employee contributions are up as well, so total retirement saving today is much higher than during traditional pensions era.

@401keditor @NIRSonline It was possible to figure out from DOL Form 5500 data that retirement plan contributions have risen. What Alicia's paper did was look at DB pension accruals, which is more complex. Even then, the shift raised saving. One reason: DBs had no employee contribution.
@joerileyhudson @investing_in_ed @NCPERS I think the story is wrong. I checked the @RetirementRsrch Public Plans database, and since 2001 North Carolina's return has exceeded 7% about half the time. But the long-term return seems to be under 7%.
“Public Pension Return Assumptions Fall to All-Time Low”? In fact, pensions' assumed returns are at record highs. https://t.co/l1rldVBVjA
@joerileyhudson @investing_in_ed @NCPERS I wonder whether that can be true; sure, the average return over 21 years is less than 7%. But to not to hit 7% in ANY single year? That's tough to pull off.
@cate_long @JBalmaceda787 I'm pretty sure we've looked at precisely that mechanism; I'll check on it. It's not something we're oblivious to.
@cate_long @JBalmaceda787 What do you mean "never fix the legacy retirees"?
@GregRenoff @DavidLeeRoth @joerogan I've always wondered if (ok, assumed) Ed's guitar magazine interviews had a rider stating no band/music questions. But with DLR, who knows...
@cate_long @JBalmaceda787 Cate, the shift of all employees, current and future, to DC pensions is the most far-reaching public pension reform ever in the U.S. and will have huge positive effects for the long-term budget. I'm good with that.
@cate_long I *think* so, but I'd have to check.
@investing_in_ed @NCPERS Public plans lowered their nominal assumed investment returns, but RAISED their real return assumption. https://t.co/iKPxIp7YCJ	Public plans must amortize unfunded liabilities over 20-30 years. Investment risk is significant even over those periods.
I'm pretty sure that when Prudential set a price to take on WR Grace's pension liabilities, it didn't assume a 7-8% return on investments, as state/local government pensions do. https://t.co/c5GDm1WMBl
@401keditor @NIRSonline And interesting point on other countries -- any links appreciated!
@401keditor @NIRSonline Various data show that pre-retirees are scared, but once they retirees the vast majority (~80%) say they're fine. In the Fed's SCF, the share of retiree who say they can at least maintain their preretirement standard of living improved from 61% in 1989 to 75% in 2016.
According to a @nirs survey, 3/4 of Americans believe WE face a retirement crisis. I can believe it. But how many Americans believe THEY face a retirement crisis? Very few. People are scared, partly because people scare them. But the reality of retirement is much more positive. https://t.co/Y0sPFqO4Sa

@Wagner2626 @cate_long Puerto Rico can't pay bondholders in full, but creditors aren't going to be zeroed out. There are expenses that can and are being cut. But the Board tries to set the big picture (eg, the budget) while letting the elected officials make decisions within that framework.
@Ed_Realist That's why you get DROP plans or people quitting and then getting rehired; the teacher's annual contribution is greater that the additional benefits they earn.
@Ed_Realist 3. If I understand the research, teacher effectiveness generally levels out at 5-10 years of tenure; the benefits of additional experience may not be worth the big gradation in pension accruals at, say, 25 to 35 years. (Not 100% sure on that, but possibly.)
@Ed_Realist A couple of thoughts. 1. I don't personally know how teachers plan their careers vs just seeing how things play out. 2. Even if a teacher plans for a full career, many are 2ndary earners and might have to move out of area/state, which could cause a change of pension, big losses.
@Ed_Realist IDK. Right now, pension contributions are a HUGE part of education spending. I'd guess at least some teachers would prefer a higher salary and less generous pension, given the choice.
@Wagner2626 @cate_long No. Promesa requires that essential spending be funded (which I'm confident it is, at least in the aggregate) but not that the Board specify what is/isn't essential, or that "non-essential" spending be eliminated.

@dcjretiresecure @annetergesen @WSJ The problem isn't insufficient sample sizes that multi-year data will fix. It's that the CPS systematically understates retirement plan coverage, every year and (as best I can tell) for every group.
@cate_long Step 1. Identify and eliminate all non-essential spending. Step 2. End of collaboration.
@investing_in_ed Certainly it will be much better in terms of living longer (not a small thing!) But studies predicting a retirement crisis don't take differential mortality into account; ie, they assume the poor will live longer, and need more savings, than they do.

@NCPSSM In fact, if you look at recent Census Bureau research - which uses IRS data to more accurately measure retirees' incomes - the true poverty rate among 65+ Americans is about 6.9%. https://t.co/Im4krDHcva And SSA projects elderly poverty will continue to decline.
@Mitchell_JoshW @dcjretiresecure @annetergesen @WSJ That's probably right; you could represent a state in terms that the NCS outputs measure.
@Mitchell_JoshW @dcjretiresecure @annetergesen @WSJ Ok, I get it. But even in the 2012 CPS for NJ, 81% of households with at least one full-time worker say they're offered a retirement plan. Given even the 2012 CPS's undercounting, true household coverage is what, 90%? I just wish we could cut the scare-stats on retirement.
@dcjretiresecure @annetergesen @WSJ Also: I understand the state data issue. But the BLS NCS employer data show for Middle Atlantic states (NY, NJ, PA) that 71% of all workers have access to a plan. That's not because NY/PA have much better access; it's because the NCS data accurately show higher plan coverage.
@dcjretiresecure @annetergesen @WSJ What's the data source? (The CPS gives almost precisely the same answer).
@SquaredAwayBC And yet employment rates for older individuals have been rising.
@annetergesen @WSJ The same data New Jersey uses to make this claim - the BLS's Current Population Survey - tells us that only 69% of federal workers are offered a retirement plan. In fact, 100% of federal workers have a pension. It's the same story for state/local govt workers. It's bad data.

/5 Why does that matter? Because a) if auto-IRAs are participant fee-supported, that's fewer accounts to spread fees over; and b) if some employers drop or fail to start 401ks due to auto-IRAs, that's more losers (no match, low contribs) relative to the coverage gap being fixed.
/4 My point on all this is that states are establishing auto-IRA plans based on Current Population Survey data that almost surely overstate the retirement plan coverage gap by a LOT. They shouldn't be surprised if actual enrollment comes in well below the forecasted levels.
/3 BLS National Compensation Survey data show 81% of full-time employees offered a retirement plan. The NCS doesn't link spouses, so we can't tell the household coverage rate. But it's still going to be high.
/2 Likewise, both IRS SOI data &amp; SSA analysis show ~80% of married couples to be *participating* in a retirement plan, implying that the household coverage rate is even higher. Say, if 85% of households who are offered plan participate, this implies a coverage rate of ~93%.
As a follow up: what matters for retirement savings (&amp; retirement incomes) is the household. And on a household basis, even the CPS - which dramatically undercounts retirement plan coverage - shows 8-in-10 households w/at least 1 full-time worker to be covered. 1/

@Seanski_McG @amprog It doesn't really matter in an economic sense (various studies conclude). But if the trust fund has a positive balance, benefits get paid automatically. If not, the government must take action to pay benefits, even if only to transfer dollars in. So it's a governmental trigger.

@dcjretiresecure There are similar issues with teacher 403(b)s here in the US, with the result that fees are too high.
@jjbartko It's from a survey of IRA/401(k) account holders. Currently a bit over half of households have a defined contribution account.
5/ Here's a longer-term perspective: the average employer normal cost of newly-accruing state/local government pensions benefits, as % of employee wages, from 1929-2017. Public employee pensions today, POST-reforms, are about 70% more generous than from the 1940s thru 1990. https://t.co/5ZeBsE6gEt
@riccoja Maybe, though a trust find might also make people more confident that they've "paid for" their benefits and benefits won't change year to year. Compared to other countries w/o trust funds, I think that's so. But yes, a trust fund *running out* gives a different impression!
4/ As of 2016, Nevada offered the most generous employer-funded pension benefits, edging out Oregon, the 2008 leader. Indiana was the stingiest in 2016, vs Nebraska in 2008. Nebraska's normal cost rose a lot from 2008-16; cash balance plans aren't necessarily a money-saver.
3/ Part of this is due to falling interest rates; as interest rates decline, the value (and cost) of a guaranteed future benefit goes up. But many red states showed the biggest increases in pension generosity.
This chart, drawn from @BEA_News &amp; @federalreserve data, shows the "normal cost" of new state/local govt employee pension benefits for 2000, 2008 &amp; 2016. From 2008 to 2016, only 15 states cut the generosity of new pension benefits, mostly by raising employee contributions. /2 https://t.co/LixeBhzT25

/2 Do ordinary Americans want to cover the rest with higher payroll taxes? And do they want to pay even more on top of that in order to expand Social Security? Or would they rather pay extra into their own 401(k)s or IRAs rather than to fund higher Social Security benefits?
Let's assume @amprog is right: that a "fair" Social Security payroll tax ceiling would have boosted today's trust fund by $1.4 trillion. And let's assume we keep that same fair tax ceiling going forward. That fixes about half of the long-term shortfall. 1/ https://t.co/DxOdI2zDdy

@RPvanGaalen @iljaboelaars @AnnaRappaport @Forbes Recent work by @jbmcgee compared returns on US DB &amp; DC plans. In recent years they're very similar, probably because more DC participants are using target date funds. (Also, maybe, DB fees are going up because of alternative investments.)

@Mitchell_JoshW Just checked; for 2017 it's about $54,000. In the ORG I think some substitutes/teacher aides report as teachers (say, some report being paid hourly, which is pretty unusual for a full-time teacher). That might account for some of the difference, but not sure.
@AdamBeeEcon @Mitchell_JoshW But I think the error goes the other way: the teacher gives an (accurate) annual total, but then instead of dividing it up among 36 weeks of work (9 months x 4 weeks) as Allegretto &amp; Mishel claim, the CPS divides it by 52.
@tomdryan @IRLEUCB @EconomicPolicy @YouTube This @EdNCES document gives some useful info. https://t.co/cbKmXVqKdZ
@CitizenVMachine @IRLEUCB @EconomicPolicy @YouTube Well, there is the irony of public employee unions saying what a bad job they're doing. "Come to a job represented by us and get paid 20% less!" Sure, there's the counterfactual, but it's still a little awkward.
I talked about Social Security reform and retirement savings today with @rossputin on @630khow. 	https://t.co/8yGJOrPcmA
@tomdryan @IRLEUCB @EconomicPolicy @YouTube Regardless, teachers on average only receive a tiny fraction of their total salaries from second jobs. It's just not that common.
@Mitchell_JoshW It's pretty close to the CPS ORG * 52. Running out, but I'll check it.
9/ I wish I didn't have to be such a d*ck about all this, but the errors aren't hard to figure out &amp; correct. But @EconomicPolicy &amp; @IRLEUCB seem to like the headlines more than getting the numbers right. That's not research, it's propaganda. Which is kind of sad.
8/ So, using correct teacher salaries turns a 20% teacher salary penalty into salary parity. (I think teachers actually work around 10 months p/y, so salaries are about even.) And official data on teacher benefits turn salary parity into a total compensation premium.
7/ According to @federalreserve/@BEA_News data published in the National Income &amp; Product Accounts, the official balance sheet of the US, public school teachers earned benefits worth about 45% of their wages; the avg private sector worker, only 23%.
7/ The @economicpolicy &amp; @IRLEUCB study ALSO understates teacher benefits, in 2 ways. 1 They measure only what schools pay for teacher pensions, which in any given year is unrelated to benefits earned by teachers. 2 They omit teachers retiree health benefits, which can be costly.
6/ We all make mistakes. But shouldn't you notice if your annualized salary figure is almost 1/3rd lower than other data on annual teacher salaries? Especially if other researchers pointed out the same problem 12 years ago? https://t.co/RgZNVRXTGg
5/ How could they have gotten this so wrong? They rely on CPS ORG data for weekly wages. However, most teachers actually tell the CPS their ANNUAL salary, which the CPS then divides by *52*. For teachers who tell the CPS their annual salary, the average is...wait for it..$59,852.
4/ If we did NOTHING except use the correct annual teacher salary, the 20% salary gap claimed by @IRLEUCB &amp; @EconomicPolicy turns into a teacher salary premium of about 10%. (That's $58,950/9 months, divided into a weekly salary of $1,638.)
3/ But wait! At $1,137 per week over 9 months, that makes for an average annual teacher salary of 🤔$40,932. But the REAL average teacher salary in 2017, according to @NEAToday data published by the @EdNCES, was $58,950. https://t.co/wTy47pGJBN
2/ According to this EPI paper, teachers earned an average of $1,137 per week over a 9-month school year, versus $1,476 for comparable private sector workers. Voila! [Chef's kiss sounds] There's your teacher pay gap. 		https://t.co/VWlK9JBuu1

@helaineolen /2 Put another way, Mark &amp; I found that total compensation (inc health benefits) rose at similar rates for rich &amp; poor, but the different mixes causes lower wage growth/higher benefit growth for the poor. Seems like a story worth telling, not ignoring.
@helaineolen "No reason." There's plenty of research finding that when employer costs for payroll taxes or benefit rise, they hold back on employee wages. Plenty of it. And that seems to be what happened. 1/

@helaineolen The rich-get-richer explanation for the falling share of wages covered by Social Security taxes is misleading. In reality, this is a health costs story.

New Social Security bill retains — and even enhances — benefits https://t.co/koTa5MaKU8
@Mitchell_JoshW An error by me: this $229 billion figure is just state/local plans. I think CSRS/FERS DB benefits in 2012 were about $75 billion.
@Mitchell_JoshW It's age-unrestricted. Cashouts/rollovers are not included, though with DB plans these are small. Disability would be included, which is more important, but it's complicated since public DBs may not switch disabled workers to retirement benefits at retirement age.
@Mitchell_JoshW For instance: I think for 2012 you're finding about $399 billion in total DB benefits; the Census Survey of Public Pensions shows about $229 billion paid out of public plans.
@Mitchell_JoshW I'm not sure it does, in the sense that a big chunk of the DB income you're finding is presumably from public sector plans. Which raises: a) they're not really going away; and b) many (most?) non-public sector retirees never had a DB plan. Is there any way to disentangle?
@investing_in_ed I'll put it this way: the range of estimates of government plan underfunding, from Social Security on down, is far larger than the range of estimates of retirement undersaving by households. That's unambiguous.	https://t.co/uctiwaaMlJ
@investing_in_ed And yet, according to government reports, practically every government-issued retirement system in the US is significantly underfunded. Elected officials aren't stupid, but there are strong incentives to promise benefits without fully funding them.
It is! Read on, retirement nerds. https://t.co/gqSW6LYym4
@_SunshineRising @MarcGoldwein @waysandmeans @AdamBeeEcon @Mitchell_JoshW I think you need to look at what AEI folks write. Say, some favored the tax cut, others not. Some agree with me on retirement, some don't. You can go back to other policies and see a similar split. Propaganda organizations don't usually act that way.
@kdrum I can play two drums at once.
@MSFalk True, though poverty in old age is already lower than earlier in life and is projected to fall in most models. So inadequate replacement rates are where the real problem (if there is one) will likely be.
@HollyBullardFL @SquaredAwayBC It's more how Social Security compensates for lower earnings. Women have lower earnings, which by itself means a higher Social Security replacement rate. But Social Security also pays a spousal supplement to the lower-earning spouse, which boosts women's benefits more.
@MSFalk Thanks! There really isn't a lot of interesting untapped data out there. Reconciling the stories told by different datasets and factoids is important. Healthcare is a bigger problem, but it's also much less efficient than Social Security so maybe more value gains are possible.
@Mitchell_JoshW @SquaredAwayBC Also hard to talk about saving that way. Even in the CPS (which undercounts retirement plan coverage), there's only a very small coverage gap if you look at households where one spouse isn't offered a plan.
@CoryKoedel They believe in America, or at least the part of America represented in alternative investments.
More and better data is CRUCIAL to retirement policy. There are many things we don't know, and others we think we know which turn out to be wrong. Without better data we'll be making policy by intuition and anecdote. https://t.co/7S1gLVjonr
@SquaredAwayBC If you look at SSA's projections of retirement income replacement rates, women don't come out worse than men. Lower retirement savings, but a higher replacement rate from Social Security. More savings for other purposes might make sense, but not necessarily for retirement.
But public sector pensions have reduced their inflation assumptions by even more, resulting in pensions today assuming record-high real rates of return.		https://t.co/x6eTldjOKM https://t.co/L2urRNTomq
/2 So there's a real risk of not solving a true funding problem - Social Security - while paying to oversolve a problem that's been exaggerated. Congress needs real study &amp; inquiry on this, not the Members reading talking points from cue cards at Committee hearings.
Samuelson makes a good point: if @uscbo is right, the Social Security deficit is a lot bigger than sponsors of the #Secure2100 Act think. And if I'm right about household retirement saving, the need for Social Security expansion is a lot smaller. 	https://t.co/uctiwaaMlJ https://t.co/UscqpTtgs4

@RPvanGaalen It's an existential issue. If public pensions had to operate under US private pension accounting/funding rules - say, a 4% discount rate and 7-year amortization period - government contributions would quadruple. Most plans should shift to DC, which aren't as generous.

@RPvanGaalen A few years back I attended a conference with pension administrators from the US, Netherlands and other countries. I was shocked (&amp; so were some of the non-US administrators) at the lack of financial sophistication of the US administrators vs their overseas counterparts.
@RPvanGaalen Yup. But what does a Nobel prize winning economist know compared to a bunch of political appointees looking to minimize the (current) budgetary costs of pensions for their political masters? Not much, it seems!
@brentsheather @RPvanGaalen You must hate working people. Or at least that's the response you'll get if you suggest that for public sector plans.
@FreequentFlyr @aparnamath @AEIecon @Forbes @ForbesOpinion True, though employment at older ages has increased at all earning levels. And mortality between, say, 65 and 75 isn't high enough to cause the increases I'm seeing. Incomes at ages 65-74 rising MUCH faster than ages 55-64, throughout the distribution.
@RPvanGaalen US public plans claim 80% funded using an 8% discount rate is okay. So for each dollar of promised future benefits, a Dutch pension has probably set aside 2-3x more money. It's a very different culture here of running a pension plan; much more politicized, less financial acumen.
@aparnamath @AEIecon @Forbes @ForbesOpinion The story you hear on the retirement side is that people are "forced" to work longer by inadequate retirement saving. What doesn't fit is that retiree incomes, across the board, are growing faster than incomes for near-retirees.
@RPvanGaalen Very little of that is discussed (and even less, discussed accurately) in the US public sector.
@RPvanGaalen In the US, a public sector fund (meaning, for government employees) is intended to be free-standing and self-sufficient. The emphasis is on low rather than smooth contributions. The govt/taxpayer bears almost all of the underfunding risk.
@RPvanGaalen In the US, I believe private plans think about the term structure; public sector plans don't, they just pick a rate based on the assumed long-term return on the portfolio. It's much less sophisticated than in the Netherlands, so the policy focus is on eliminating the big errors.

@RoamtheDomes @dcjretiresecure The problem with OR Saves that didn't come up at the hearing: enrollment is a lot lower than forecast (about 1/10th, according to the WSJ). If the fixed admin costs are financed by participants, that's a real problem. I'm sure the state will swallow it for now, but not happily.
@JanetheActuary @Meegs343434 @AllisonSchrager Exactly. It phases out the tax cap, because the current law tax max of $132k rises with wages (about 4% annually) and the $400k threshold stays constant, so eventually they meeting and all wages are taxed at 14.8%.
@OS_Mitchell 4/ Compared to Saez/Liebman, today's negative response would be larger because current law income tax rates are higher than in 2006; and the #Secure2100 Act would raise both the tax rate &amp; the cap, so the increase in the top effective marginal tax rate is 14.8 points, not 12.4.
@OS_Mitchell 3/ Second, they look at losses due to lower labor supply, compensation shifting, tax evasion, etc. (For geeks, the elasticity of taxable income.) Assuming a modest response (0.2), net revenues from lifting the tax max are only half the gross. Assuming 0.5, the net is zero.
@OS_Mitchell 2/ First, when *employer* payroll taxes go up, employers cover their costs by cutting employee wages. Those lost wages are then no longer subject to Social Security/Medicare payroll taxes &amp; state/local income taxes. By itself, this cuts the gross revenue increase by about 19%.

@MikeOtsuka I think CPP uses about 6%. US Social Security uses a bond yield because that's what's in the fund. If SS moved to stocks, the SSA actuaries would raise the discount rate, but the Congressional Budget Office's economists would probably stick with the bond yield.
@generationalize @ernietedeschi Ruler	Ruler	Ruler	Ruler	Really long ruler (actuaries' favorite forecasting tool).
@KimberlyBurham If you combine OAS with CPP, the total replacement rate is similar on the low end. But CPP is a flat replacement rate (something like 25%), so once you go above the middle the CPP pays less than Social Security. Now I'm interesting; I'll see what I can dig up.
@glesgabrighton It's a bunch of reasons. The CPP has a real investment fund, while Social Security is mostly paygo. Also, a lot of the progressive part of Canada pensions is done via a general revenue program. Also, Social Security about 1/3rd more generous than CPP for high earners.

@RetireRevised @ReutersMoney My (bitter) experience is the transition from selling a reform plan popularly to having hearings, analyzing actuarial memos &amp; dealing with opposition can be tough. #secure2100 has some advantages over prior GOP plans, but I'll still be surprised if it gets thru the House.
@glesgabrighton @hiltzikm Those replacement rate figures were pulled from the annual Trustees Report, because they're calculated differently than a DB pension or financial planner would. But SSA's actuaries produce a recurring actuarial note with projected rep rates; see here: https://t.co/MMDwYZljjG
@JoseOyola2 @hiltzikm @SSWorks I don't think the coverage expansion would have affected these numbers, since they're using stylized workers at different earnings levels.
@RetireRevised @RepJohnLarson @WSJ @jctgov Short-term #secure2100 is a very good deal for low earners, since the extra benefits precede the extra payroll taxes. Long-term, a low earner is better off than if they'd had a GOP-type plan &amp; saved the extra payroll taxes themselves, though I don't think dramatically so.
@RetireRevised @RepJohnLarson @WSJ @jctgov Unfortunately, SSA's actuaries don't illustrate post-tax benefits, though CBO's Social Security model can do that. Overall it's not a big benefit increase (about 1.1% on average) but it's concentrated on middle-income, near-term retirees. Strategically, a smart move I'd think.
@RetireRevised @RepJohnLarson @WSJ @jctgov Because the $400k threshold for the new tax isn't indexed while the tax max rises with wages, the payroll tax ceiling is basically phased out (I think in about 29 years). Initially it's only a tax increase on the rich , but eventually it's also upper middle class.
@hiltzikm Sure, it doesn't say one way or the other what the replacement rate should be.
@PaulNVandeWater @hiltzikm @SSWorks Yes, though the 25% increase in replacement rates -- roughly, from 30% to 40% for a medium earner using SSA's replacement rate methodology -- exists even after the over-indexing was clawed back. So presumably mostly the 1972 increase.
Put another way: a high wage earner today (earning 1.6x the average wage) receives about the same replacement rate as a low-wage earner (0.45x average wage) when Social Security started. 		Not bashing @hiltzikm or #secure2100, but to me it was interesting.
This quote from @hiltzikm's article on #secure2100 got me thinking: what happened to Social Security ~50 years ago? SSA data show a benefit increase of about 25%. https://t.co/wGvDN4ELvc @SSWorks https://t.co/8c1zRZfy9R
@MSFalk In this case I'm just best-guessing what I *think* will actually happen. Policywise, I personally think that benefits accrued to date should be paid, except under severe financial duress, but the rate of future accruals often should be reduced to something more reasonable.
@MSFalk I assume public pension benefits will be paid and think that's pretty safe. Even in Puerto Rico, which is bankrupt, nearly all pension benefits will likely end up being paid.
@MSFalk If you're doing a head-to-head comparison then you need days worked. For teachers, a 10 month work year (9 months in class + 1 month prep) has some support in the data. For comparing growth of pay, you just need to assume that the workdays differences don't change much over time.
@NevadaPolicyRI @andrewvandam @WashPost Just finished a draft, but there's some interesting stuff there on federal, state/local &amp; public education pay, including pensions and other benefits. Some particularly good stuff on Nevada, come to think of it. Stay tuned!
5/ There's more going on with teacher pay, which will be the subject of a different forthcoming paper. But the key is that you simply can't ignore the outsized (and growing) role of benefits in public sector compensation. A salary-only comparison just doesn't work.
4/ What you want to know is the growth of total compensation. Over the last two decades, total average salaries &amp; benefits grew slightly faster in public education than in private sector jobs. https://t.co/Pyc1W9Xsdi
3/ But the NIPA (importantly) also includes benefits, which are both larger in public education and grew more quickly. From 1998 to 2017, real benefits per worker grew by 76% in the the private sector, but 122% in public education. Much of that growth is due to pensions. https://t.co/8cn4pNUGG4
2/ I use a different dataset - the National Income &amp; Product Accounts - but they also show wages in public education lagging average private sector salaries. From 1998-2017, real average private sector salaries rose 18%, vs 11% in public education. So that story is similar. https://t.co/TaHqWrElgO
@andrewvandam of the @washpost has an interesting piece on teacher salaries, finding that they've fallen behind the average in many states. I've just finished a paper on public sector compensation that may shed some light on this. 1/	https://t.co/3YBHMvKvc4
@t3703 @RepJohnLarson 2/ OTOH, there's good evidence that retirees (even/especially those with plenty of money) reduce their spending as they age, even including health costs. It's not running out of money, people just spend less. If so, a higher COLA probably isn't needed vs other uses.
@t3703 @RepJohnLarson I've had mixed feelings on COLAs. At times I've favored higher COLAs to boost benefits later in retirement when they're most valuable &amp; most needed. If coupled with an initial benefit cut to finance the boost, I could still probably go for that. 1/
@RepJohnLarson @WSJ @jctgov #Secure2100 can be a starting point; it makes Social Security solvent &amp; boosts benefits for the poor. But as is, it won't pass &amp; shouldn't pass, and would be a wasted opportunity to FINALLY fix Social Security. All done!
@RepJohnLarson @WSJ @jctgov Progressives dream of Scandinavian-level top tax rates, but #Secure2100 seems an odd way to use that money, versus (say) Medicare For All. Both aren't going to happen, so realistic progressives need to choose.
@RepJohnLarson @WSJ @jctgov And for what? Shorter-career workers receive very little benefit increase, even if they're most likely to retire in poverty. High/maximum wage workers receive larger benefit hikes, even if they don't need them &amp; will likely reduce personal saving in response.
@RepJohnLarson @WSJ @jctgov And if workers respond even modestly to higher taxes by working less, net revenue gains from #Secure2100 could be cut in half. This would increase deficits in the non-Social Security budget and increase federal debt.
@RepJohnLarson @WSJ Employers would be hit with new 6% payroll tax for high earners, which SSA/CBO believe they'll fund by cutting salaries. This means lower income/Medicare tax receipts on those lost salaries. @jctgov estimates 12-23% of payroll tax increases lost via lower income tax receipts.
@RepJohnLarson @WSJ The Social Security "tax max" is phased out, which raises the effective top marginal tax rate by 12%. Adding state income taxes, we're already pushing a 70% top rate. The US would probably have the highest top tax rate in the OECD. https://t.co/lSlN8AUbeH
@RepJohnLarson @WSJ Moreover, research on 401k autoenrollment finds that low earners may offset lower take-home pay by increasing mortgage/auto/credit card debt. The same could happen with #Secure2100's higher Social Security taxes, which could leave low earners worse off. https://t.co/kEJ2FyXpqe
@RepJohnLarson @WSJ Higher taxes: The payroll tax rate rises from 12.4% to 14.4%, raising lifetime taxes paid by low/middle income workers by 1/5th. Their benefits rise by much less than 1/5th, so this isn't a sweetheart deal for low earners.
@RepJohnLarson But here are some criticisms; most of these draw on this 2017 op-ed I wrote in @wsj. The 2019 version of #Secure2100 hasn't changed much since then. https://t.co/Eg7UlTmMqg
@RepJohnLarson Post-retirement benefit COLAs also would increase, being based on the CPI-E. All would benefit, but the rich most of all due to the rising income/longevity gap.
@RepJohnLarson #Secure2100 would substantially increase benefits (10 to 40%) for low/very low earners, IF they work full 30-40 careers. For short/mid-career low-wage workers, benefit increases are more modest (&lt;5%).
@RepJohnLarson The SSA actuaries scores is available at https://t.co/Z6fVEHTAXK 	 	 And #Secure2100 has 200 original cosponsors, 85% of House Democrats. That's more cosponsors than any GOP plan ever had. No one can say anymore that Democrats don't have a plan for Social Security.
@RepJohnLarson #Secure2100 would make Social Security solvent; not just for 75 years, but beyond. That's an achievement that involves a bunch of tough choices.
@RepJohnLarson The good: someone is finally paying attention to Social Security reform! It's the biggest federal program; the biggest tax most workers pay; and the biggest source of income for most retirees. And it's underfunded by around 20%.

@jonshorman @rachaelheisler It's not like refinancing a home, where the owner pays sooner or later. Reamortizing pension debt simply shifts costs to future taxpayers, making current ones better off. This is financially no different than the government borrowing money and passing on the bill.
But it's also worth pointing out that, once on Social Security, return to work is very unlikely: in 2017, 0.55% of DI beneficiaries left rolls for work, up from 0.46% in 2007. Room to grow, though I don't really see it happening.

@JHWeissmann @swinshi 2/ The research seems to find retirees access housing wealth mostly in emergencies, although many do downsize which frees up cash. But this may simply indicate that most retiree don't face financial emergencies. Housing wealth is treated most as insurance, it seems.
@JHWeissmann @swinshi Studies differ. Gale, Scholz &amp; Seshadri treat housing as wealth. Hurd &amp; Rohwedder assume it's tapped only if all other assets exhausted. This recent Urban study (finding around 30% undersaving) assumes no home equity access at all. https://t.co/PnxeeC8sMx 1/

@stanveuger @JimPethokoukis If lawmakers have certain criteria they wish to satisfy with immigration - productivity, ability to assimilate, refugees, whatever - why not simply apply them, rather than hoping US residents might do so with their relatives?
@stanveuger @JimPethokoukis Um, yeah.
@stanveuger @JimPethokoukis Sure, but under current policy the picking largely isn't done by firms, universities or (US) individuals. The bigger criterion is whether a person already has a relative in this country, which has no obvious connection to intuitive goals for immigration policy.
@JimPethokoukis 2. Your chart showing the country of origin of immigrant founders doesn't match up well (at all) to the distribution of US immigrants by country. Why not focus on composition rather than simply numbers?

But your paper is comparing a higher investment risk retirement plan (teacher pensions) to a lower risk plan (401ks), crediting the teacher plan with the higher returns that are reward for risk but not accounting for the cost of that risk. So it's not apples-to-apples.
@n_rhee @NIRSonline @RANDCorporation @CalPERS Just for interest: in the University Chicago survey of prominent economists, 96% agreed that the GASP approach you're relying on understates public pension costs.

@n_rhee @NIRSonline @RANDCorporation @CalPERS If a teacher is considering switching to a private jobs, it's actually very useful. They might know the private jobs's 401k match, but that's still a risky benefit vs the guaranteed teacher pension. How do you compare them? The NIPA-style DB plan normal cost plan is the answer.
@FreseMike @MaestroGaeta @DeanBaker13 I'd have to look them up; but if I remember, CA did better than most other states in salary growth.
@DeanBaker13 They're doing a wage regression, whose specs I disagree with in some ways &amp; am happy to talk about.		But the claim that teacher wages have grown much more slowly than other college educated workers doesn't really hold up.
@DeanBaker13 The NIPA (unfortunately) don't break down compensation by education. But in the CPS, since 2000 teacher salaries have grown at the same rate as other college educated workers. Teacher benefits almost surely grew more quickly.
@BenSpielberg @DeanBaker13 @EconomicPolicy In the National Income &amp; Product Accounts, which count both wages &amp; benefits, real compensation per worker in public education grew by 37% from 1998-2017. In the private sector, real compensation per worker grew by only 27%.
@SquaredAwayBC But this loss is muted by the progressivity of the benefit formula, the spousal benefit and the 35-years of wage used in calculating benefits. The lost years of work probably don't matter much; lower earnings on return to work might matter more.

@JanetheActuary @NIRSonline 2/ I can find those total normal costs, then break down between taxpayers/employees. They're quite large, and heavily weighted to taxpayers.
@JanetheActuary @NIRSonline I disagree on that. The normal cost calculated with a risk-adjusted discount rate catches the employer's obligation to make future controls to make up for subpar investment returns. 1/
@JanetheActuary @NIRSonline Exactly. In present value, it's just taxpayers &amp; workers, with taxpayers covering about 2/3rds of the total.
@NIRSonline @JanetheActuary But investment earnings aren't a "who" in who pays the costs. Today's investment earnings came from yesterday's contributions from workers and taxpayers.
@n_rhee @NIRSonline @RANDCorporation @CalPERS 3/ Your current paper mostly ignores risk for both DB &amp; DC plans, but due to the portfolio difference you're ignoring more on the DB side, &amp; that largely accounts for the benefit difference. I know you think it's ok to ignore that risk, but NIPA, Fed, etc. say it's not.
@n_rhee @NIRSonline @RANDCorporation @CalPERS 2/ This issue doesn't get directly at your paper on DB/DC cost efficiency. But NIPA (and CBO, the Fed, most academics, etc) back the basic approach I took in the teacher pay papers, where teacher pensions were found to be much more expensive/generous than 401ks.
@n_rhee @NIRSonline @RANDCorporation @CalPERS NIPA also measure the benefits themselves. But prospectively, if you're promising a DB benefit you're not just promising future normal cost payments; you're also committed to making up for subpar investment returns. That's a cost, and there's a way to put a price on it. 1/
@n_rhee @NIRSonline @RANDCorporation @CalPERS In this case, I argued merely for holding risk equal by assuming the same investment portfolio.		Though: in calculating employee compensation from pensions, the National Income &amp; Product Accounts DO use the employer normal cost calculated at a bond rate. And that's correct.

@CitizenVMachine @nirs Exactly. And NIRS knows this, even if it's put in fine print. 		But the "Pensionomics generates millions of new jobs" headline is too good (for them) to resist. https://t.co/VUGzgbdLoY
@n_rhee @NIRSonline @RANDCorporation @CalPERS The point is that risk is a cost, and if you're counting on the gains from different levels of risk you also need to account for the different costs of risk. If DB plans are better than 401ks simply because they take more risk, that's not very convincing.
@n_rhee @NIRSonline @RANDCorporation @CalPERS Ex post, it cost what it cost, which is a lot more than just the normal cost. Ex ante, you want to value risk as markets (meaning, people) value risk. The vast, vast majority of economists agree on this.
@n_rhee @NIRSonline @RANDCorporation @CalPERS There are circumstances in which govts can ignore risk. Say, Arrow &amp; Lind argue give can ignore risk if the risks are small and not correlated with incomes. Say, a bridge or a school. But pensions heavily invested in stocks? No.
@Mitchell_JoshW @Frugal_Saver @cri_states @Oregonsaves @CRR @ORSaves @KathPender @annetergesen @TreasurerRead @RetirementRsrch @MikeMcLaneOR Because the CPS pension coverage figures for public sector workers would be obviously wrong?? 😀
@NIRSonline If you'd like to stand by it at a public debate on 'pensionomics', I'd be happy to take part.
@n_rhee @NIRSonline @RANDCorporation @CalPERS 2/ Regardless, you want to hold risk constant. In a DB plan, the taxpayer bears the risk; in a 401k, the workers does. But by using different portfolio/return assumptions, you're assuming taxpayers are bearing more risk than 401k participants, but not counting that extra cost.
@n_rhee @NIRSonline @RANDCorporation Well, more than 100% of @CalPERS lower assumed return is by cutting inflation assumptions; CalPERS real return assumption - which is what matters for a plan paying COLAs - has gone up. Which is nutty. /1   https://t.co/TQ0qOWk4Nd
@SteveRo48195125 Exactly.
@SPO1707 @nirs They may be. But as long as you assume the same multiplier on the benefit &amp; cost sides, it will net close to zero.
5/ The public deserves a real discussion of the pros of DB pensions, which are real, as are the cons. But the @nirs "pensionomics" study is just BS which relies on counting only one side of the equation. We can do better than this.
4/ But perhaps not even that. DB pensions induce early retirement, which reduces GDP. Public pensions destabilize govt budgets, causing cuts to education &amp; public safety.
3/ Those contributions, which now can't be saved or spent, have a demultiplier (divisor?) effect on the economy, cutting GDP, jobs &amp; taxes. And since long term, contributions + interest (which also can't be spent) = benefits (net of fees), to the economy as a whole it's a wash.
2/ @nirs counts the benefits paid by pensions, plus a multiplier effect as benefits are respent, then touts those as the economic boost. But NIRS ignores the cost of pensions, all the contributions that employers, taxpayers &amp; employees make to those plans.
It's unfortunate to have to spend so much time clarifying @nirs output. But their claim that pensions generate $1.2 trillion in GDP, 7.5 million jobs &amp; $203 billion in tax revenues is just incredibly misleading. 1/ https://t.co/3mCb2D2wtS

@n_rhee @NIRSonline @RANDCorporation 2/ But unless a plan like CalPERS takes a LOT of risk to keep the assumed return high, the annual contributions are unaffordable. The asset allocation isn't driven by participant age or the nature of the benefits. It's drive by a need to keep contributions low. Bad stewardship.
@n_rhee @NIRSonline @RANDCorporation As an eg: CalPERS states that an all-retiree plan should hold about 60% bonds, 40% risky assets. Ok. But CalPERS overall holds 84% risky assets overall. Given that, the implicit risky asset allocation for active employees is well more than 100%. No one thinks that makes sense. 1/
@n_rhee @NIRSonline @RANDCorporation You're assuming that, but other factors - particularly the need to pay guaranteed benefits on time and in full - could point to taking less risk. I doubt there's any age/risk rule (say, stocks = 100 - age) that would justify the level of risk-taking by public plans.
@Mitchell_JoshW @swinshi 2/ But do we really have THAT many voluntary early retirements of people who don't want a job even if available? Maybe. But I was surprised at the number &amp; share who say they don't want work.
@Mitchell_JoshW @swinshi An example where I'm a little skeptical. Of ages 55-61 (meaning, pre-Social Security eligibility) about 11% in CPS are "retired."

@n_rhee @NIRSonline @RANDCorporation @SOActuaries Public DBs don't do asset-liability match at all the way a private (or overseas public sector) plan does. Plans SHOULD be reducing investment risk as participants age; instead, they're increasing it to gamble out of their funding problems. We shouldn't endorse that bad practice.
@n_rhee @NIRSonline @RANDCorporation You're believing in magic. Government doesn't bear risk so much as transfer it to different stakeholders -- to employees, to taxpayers, to bondholders, to beneficiaries of programs that get squeezed when pension costs rise. Value risk as those stakeholders do.
@HCorderoGuzman This @USGAO study (a little dated) breaks down Puerto Rico federal taxes and federal payments. I think the net federal transfer is about $5.5 billion.		https://t.co/2rdk1o8ZRw
@n_rhee @NIRSonline @RANDCorporation I don't disagree that teacher pensions are good for teachers. But that's not because of some magic of DB plans. It's because they're way, way more expensive than a typical 401k.
@n_rhee @NIRSonline @RANDCorporation And again, the "pensions don't" have to retreat from risk just isn't correct. The Society of Actuaries, who presumably know, said that not reducing investment risk in the face of aging participants "go[es] against basic risk management principles.”
@n_rhee @NIRSonline @RANDCorporation You haven't taken longevity risk pooling off the table. Assuming a 7.5% annuity interest rate vs 5% for a 401k boosts the DB plan's benefits by about 20%, but ignores the risk to the taxpayer. If we're ignoring risk, do it for the 401k by assuming 7.5% there as well.
@HCorderoGuzman I shouldn't wade in, but you can't compare these numbers, in the same sense that comparing total US GDP &amp; total US tax payments doesn't make sense. You could compare tax payments to federal payments, but that produces a different result.
@n_rhee @NIRSonline @RANDCorporation No, it's not. The idea that, with mere 401ks, public employees will end up on welfare in retirement is BS. These aren't low-wage employees &amp; steady participation in a 401k will produce a fine benefit. 		(I don't know what a TDF is, so I'll leave that.)
@n_rhee @NIRSonline @RANDCorporation So what are the drivers? I assume we agree that if contributions/returns/fees are assumed the same, then the avg benefit will be the same.
@n_rhee @NIRSonline @RANDCorporation 2/ Prospectively, a market value makes sense. But if you want retrospective, count the amortization payments public sponsors must make. But you CAN'T simply ignore the cost of risk entirely.
@n_rhee @NIRSonline @RANDCorporation There's a reason employers don't offer 401k that guarantee 7.5% returns; because it's expensive. The fact that states choose to do that doesn't mean it's not expensive; it means they're bearing that cost. So we need to find a way to count that cost. 1/
@n_rhee @NIRSonline @RANDCorporation Look, public pension sponsors are making huge payments to cover past investment underperformance, which they wouldn't pay with a 401k. (Ie, unfunded liabilities are solely due to past failure to pay ARCs.) So it's not an academic issue.
@n_rhee @NIRSonline @RANDCorporation Not discounting at a riskless return doesn't fix the problem, it actually ignores it. There's a cost to guaranteeing retirees a 7.5% return. Where is that cost measured in your analysis?
@n_rhee @NIRSonline @RANDCorporation Let me think this one through. You may be right.
@n_rhee @NIRSonline @RANDCorporation But the public plan is assumed to annuitize at (say) 7.5%, by holding risky assets. The taxpayers bear the cost of that risk in a way that they don't with a 401k. So it's not apples-to-apples.
@n_rhee @NIRSonline @RANDCorporation Says who? Good actuaries calibrate a DB plan's investment risk to the age of the  participants, just as a 401k holder would. Public DB plans don't do that, &amp; have been criticized by the @SOActuaries for taking excessive risk.

@tomlinsonjoet I agree. Progress has been made on investments in the accumulation phase. Access and participation should be higher, plus giving greater annuity options on the decumulation side.
@OS_Mitchell @NIRSonline @RANDCorporation Exactly. A 401k plan has investment risk, but a DB pension has solvency risk of the sponsor (ask retirees in Puerto Rico, multiemployer pensions, etc.).
@reverendbob716 @NIRSonline @RANDCorporation At the least, that would help with these "teachers are underpaid" arguments, since so much of teacher compensation comes through pensions that are much more generous than in the private sector.
6/ In sum, teacher pensions ARE more generous than 401ks, but that's mostly because they're much more expensive. Are public sector DB plans more efficient? Maybe, but not by much, and they come with significant downsides, particularly to taxpayers who foot the bill.
5/ In alternate specs, NIRS assumes that 401k holders receive returns 1% below the DB plan. At one point that may have been true, but with 401ks today featuring low-cost index &amp; auto-managed target date funds, I don't think it still is. See work by @jbmcgee.
4/ NIRS also assumes that 401k holders buy annuities at a lower assumed return. That's fine by itself. But a DB plan effectively pays annuities assuming a much higher rate of return, on which the taxpayer bears the investment risk. NIRS ignores that cost, but it shouldn't.
3/ One thing NIRS is doing is adding an extra 0.25% fees to the 401k, while not considering DB plan fees - but public plan fees today are often very high. In effect, this implies that any 401k-type plan will have DB plan fees + 25 basis points, which isn't right.
2/ But I find NIRS overall results puzzling. If you assume the same contributions, investment returns &amp; fees, then the *average* benefit will be the same between a DB plan &amp; a 401(k); even if the distribution will differ greatly between short/long career workers.
A quick thread on this study. I agree with @nirsonline that DB pensions are a much better deal for teachers, even shorter career teachers, than some critics claim. See my 2018 @RANDCorporation paper showing why. 1/ 	https://t.co/sKehXTYlUj https://t.co/1dy0Cc7cYV

@SteveRo48195125 Definitely. The return difference between Social Security &amp; 5% is the sum of the risk premium over safe investments &amp; the fact that Social Security is unfunded. So unfortunately, there's no way to get a higher return without either putting up more money or taking more risk.

@t3703 I mean that AEI doesn't have institutional views &amp; there's surprising diversity of views on different topics among different AEI scholar. Sure, the researchers slant right, but there simply aren't agreed-upon (or imposed) policy views of AEI as a whole.
@t3703 @nber Why not? If you (say) lower the Social Security early retirement age from 65 to 62 &amp; you find more people are dying in that age range, isn't the policy change a plausible  cause?
@oblioist Can't exactly say why, but I wouldn't be surprised if that were true.
@oblioist True, but it shows up in broader populations as well: https://t.co/XyVHCkemkA
Yes, but it hits *tomorrow's* taxpayers, not today's. And guess who's making the decisions to kick the can down the road? https://t.co/6SJzJkIjD3
@Mitchell_JoshW That's a neat point. If you die prior to claiming, is SSA or some other agency necessarily tracking it? I assume you could look at changes in beneficiaries at some later age (eg 70) at which nearly everyone has claimed.
RT @Mitchell_JoshW: @biggsag Here is the same finding for the US:	https://t.co/SFWHOYDzuO
@t3703 @nber And what the study is look at is the first factor, which is interesting and perhaps policy-relevant. 		AEI as an organization has no views on anything. As for me, we (presumably) need to have some minimum Social Security retirement age so the question is what it should be.
@t3703 @nber I don't disagree with that. But the Austria experiment was how did retiree mortality change after the government allowed early pension claiming, and so it appears it was the claiming itself - not the reasons for claiming - that affected mortality.
Raising Social Security's early retirement age of 62 wouldn't do much to help the program's solvency. But it would increase benefits, potentially substantially, once people do claim. And, if the @nber study applies to the US, it might also reduce mortality among retirees.
It's easy to understand how early retirees may die younger; poor health may cause early retirement. But in Austria, it appears that policies allowing early retirement *caused* retirees to die younger. 		https://t.co/KY1UgZxKrv

In that case, a poorly funded sponsor's benefits are worth less, which we catch by applying a higher discount rate to those benefits. But that's not a funding/economic cost.
@MikeOtsuka @JohnRalfe1 Is this really correct? When I think of the market value of liabilities, I think of the market cost of funding the liability as promised, meaning in full &amp; without risk of default. This depends on the interest rate on riskless instruments, which doesn't differ across sponsors. 1/

@JoseOyola2 The Board favored a PAN work requirement from the beginning. And Law 80 &amp; mandatory Christmas bonus also play a role. To have almost the lowest labor force participation in the world, many factors work to undermine employment.
@HCorderoGuzman @RafiArrillaga @SenRubioPress 3/ For the money, I'd much prefer Rubio's approach to a 936-like plan that lost tax revenues but didn't create very many jobs.
@HCorderoGuzman @RafiArrillaga 2/ But the low-end tax cut would be expensive and subject to claims that it benefits businesses (true, but only if they hire!). I think @SenRubioPress 's bill basically got at this problem: lower the minimum wage to make workers hirable, but make up for it with a wage subsidy.
@HCorderoGuzman @RafiArrillaga The EITC makes up for wages that are too low to attract individuals into the workforce. A low-end payroll tax cut would make up for workers whose hourly wages (net of benefit, leave, etc.) are too high for them to be hired. So they solve different problems. I'm good on both. 1/
@RafiArrillaga @HCorderoGuzman For young workers, Saez et al find positive employment effects of a targeted payroll tax cut. If young workers were predominantly hit by the min wage, I'd expect that rather than wage increases. But wages also rise for older workers; gains are shared.	https://t.co/Yx6qafIFGz https://t.co/pWqwYdacck

@HCorderoGuzman @Terpin8or @RafiArrillaga Sure, for reasons of simplicity, avoiding taxes, means tests, etc. But most estimates show the US having a MUCH smaller informal market vs the rest of the world or vs Puerto Rico. The informal market provides an outlet for PR to create jobs, but without any legal protections.
@Terpin8or @RafiArrillaga @HCorderoGuzman Really a bit of both. The informal sector is (again) evidence of how constrained the PR labor market is. There are employees &amp; employers who can agree on work terms, but those terms are illegal. So they do it illegally. That's pretty unusual on the mainland.
@HCorderoGuzman @RafiArrillaga I understand both those concerns; the govt is working on setting up the work side now, which requires working with the Ag Dept. On timing, though, if the Board doesn't push the work requirement into place it won't happen. Again, this is similar to what all the states must do.
@HCorderoGuzman @RafiArrillaga There were some simple numbers based on effects in the states, but they didn't differentiate between work, volunteering, school, etc., because the data didn't. I'll admit that stuff is very uncertain. But we've committed to not cutting PAN funding, but redistributing any savings.
@HCorderoGuzman @AppDemography @OrdenDivino @lymanstoneky I'm open to all things and all sides of the equation. I just don't want to see some aspects (which I believe to be very important) be sidelined. We need to push AND pull people into employment.
@HCorderoGuzman @AppDemography @OrdenDivino @lymanstoneky If PR policies impose high implicit taxes on beneficiaries who work, employment is hurt even when jobs are available. But if PAN requires you do *something* in exchange for benefits, by taking a job you're not giving up 40 hrs per week for low marginal gains.
@HCorderoGuzman @AppDemography @OrdenDivino @lymanstoneky Did past economic expansions correct low labor supply? No, because there are structural problems. The LFPR in PR varies with the business cycle as elsewhere, but always around 20% below mainland US. So it's not just a demand problem &amp; no amount of fiscal stimulus will fix that.
@RafiArrillaga @HCorderoGuzman I agree that minimum wage isn't going to change, but for low-wage workers Act 80 effectively raises employers costs per hour worked similar to the min wage, so loosening those requirements should constrain employment less on the low end.
@HCorderoGuzman @AppDemography @OrdenDivino @lymanstoneky Which is why a) the Board proposes making the change during a period fo projected economic expansion; and b) accompanying the PAN change with Act 80 reforms to reduce cost of employment &amp; regulation/permitting changes to encourage job growth.
@RafiArrillaga @HCorderoGuzman It may seem that way if you focus on only on the PAN work requirement. But improving the business environment will increase supply of jobs. Loosening mandatory benefits from Act 80 will increase employer demand for lower-wage workers. We've proposed a whole range of strategies.
@HCorderoGuzman @AppDemography @OrdenDivino @lymanstoneky On the other hand, this study found little effect of tightening PAN eligibility on labor supply, except for women in households with incomes were near the threshold. The author attributes this insensitivity to the minimum wage locking people out of jobs. 		https://t.co/NINKHkQOTF
@HCorderoGuzman @AppDemography @OrdenDivino @lymanstoneky This paper used a later time periods and looked at all transfers, not just food stamps. But it found that higher transfers tend to depress labor supply while higher real wages increase (both as I'd expect).		https://t.co/YGkQpZdJYc
@HCorderoGuzman @AppDemography @OrdenDivino @lymanstoneky Even with good data it would be tough; you had a recession, changing male/female rates, plus I think both the federal minimum wage &amp; Act 80 happened around the same time. That's a lot of moving parts to disentangle.
@HCorderoGuzman @RafiArrillaga If any contrary evidence is just dismissed, I don't see that as useful.		The minimum wage, labor laws or welfare policies didn't cause the financial crisis. But they do weaken the economy such that the crisis is worse, and recovery more difficult, than it otherwise would be.
@HCorderoGuzman @RafiArrillaga Any PAN savings from the work requirement would be redirected to reduce the effect of phaseouts. I'm open-minded on the EITC, so we'll see.
@HCorderoGuzman @AppDemography @OrdenDivino That's consistent with federal SNAP policy. A work requirement is designed to overcome the high implicit tax rates for non-working beneficiaries who go to work. Without the requirement, the net hourly wage from work (counting benefit phaseouts) is well below the minimum wage.
@RafiArrillaga @HCorderoGuzman This study included a survey of Puerto Rico male workers on the minimum hourly wage they'd accept. At a time the minimum wage was $5.15, almost no unemployed men would accept work at less than $7. That's a supply problem. 		https://t.co/Sftn9Nz7Ij https://t.co/fQE8WOmQo1

@RafiArrillaga @HCorderoGuzman I'm running out, but can find you research showing supply problems. But it's on both ends: a poor business environment, high mandated benefits and high minimum wage (relative to median) cut number of jobs.Welfare phaseouts, etc. lower jobseekers because implicit tax is very high.
@HCorderoGuzman @AppDemography @OrdenDivino If you compare the LFPR to mainland US back thru 1990, the ups &amp; downs of the business cycle - even post 2006 - aren't nearly as noticeable as the consistent 20% gap vs the US.

@AppDemography @OrdenDivino @HCorderoGuzman 3/ As we've said all along, Puerto Rico's labor market suffers from a lot of problems; it's hard to isolate how much each factor contributes to low employment, and no single policy change will take a 40% LBPR to 60%. That's why we've promoted a variety of reforms.

@JRomeroCasillas I'll say this: I believe every one of the Board members (and staff) to be people of integrity who are trying to do the right thing for Puerto Rico. Yes, there will be disagreements and times when we don't succeed. But we want a Puerto Rico that succeeds for everyone living there.
@JRomeroCasillas There is no agreement on pensions yet. But the Board, for its part, has tried to protect lower-income retirees who depend the most on their benefits. I know this doesn't fit the narrative that we're out to protect the hedge funds, etc., but it's the truth.
@JRomeroCasillas When a government goes bankrupt, everyone ends up sacrificing. Say, bondholders (mostly higher-income) will take a much bigger hit than pensioners (mostly lower-income). It's not going to be a one-sided outcome.
@JRomeroCasillas Look at what the Board has proposed on pensions. There's a very, very good chance that his pension wouldn't be cut at all.
@velazqg23 @FOMBPR For employers, probably so. And the Board is working hard on PREPA, and the govt is working to reduce permitting times.		High mandated benefits are more a problem for employees, because employers can offset benefit costs with lower wages.
@JRomeroCasillas High mandated paid leave will tend to increase poverty because employers respond to it by paying lower wages. When poverty is high, workers would prefer more wages to more time off. But the law doesn't allow that choice. I'm trying to cut poverty, not increase it.
@JRomeroCasillas Sure, no economy works precisely like a textbook. But when public policies produce almost exactly what the textbook predicts, denying that those policies could play any role in the outcome doesn't strike me as responsible policymaking.
@JRomeroCasillas 3/ This is exactly what you'd expect to see if things like high mandated benefits were affecting the labor market. I'm not saying it's the only factor. But when you've got near worst-in-world labor supply, it seems crazy and irresponsible to ignore these things.
@JRomeroCasillas 2/ For middle-income occupations (say, accountants) pay is much lower than the mainland, while labor force participation is closer to mainland levels. For lower-paid jobs (say, restaurant worker) relative pay is closer to mainland levels, but employment is much lower.
@JRomeroCasillas And yet: textbook econ says that if mandated benefits are too high, employers will respond by cutting wages (especially for middle class) &amp; reducing employment (for lower-paid workers). And that's exactly what you see in Puerto Rico.  /1
@JRomeroCasillas While the labor side gets a lot of attention, the Board puts more time/effort toward PREPA reform &amp; other issues designed to get at exactly what you're saying. We're not the government, but we're definitely not ignoring this stuff.
@JRomeroCasillas The Board has, for instance, required that govt contracts include disclosures of anyone who was paid to help arrange the contract. But remember, the Board can't prosecute people, nor can it rewrite the laws.
@JRomeroCasillas There are many things wrong with the economy &amp; labor market - you don't get worst-in-the-world labor force participation by only one problem. And so you try to tackle as much as you can -- say, by also trying to improve the business environment to attract employers.
@JRomeroCasillas You may be right on the corruption/colonialism link. That said, Illinois is corrupt too. In both cases, the key is to stop it. 		Before anyone hassles me: the World Bank ranks mainland US better than 94% of countries on corruption; Puerto Rico beats only 59%.
@JRomeroCasillas If Puerto Rico were independent I'm sure it would devalue its currency (as Greece would have, were it not tied to the Euro). Of course, devaluation is a hidden way of cutting wages &amp; incomes to regain competitiveness, which is one thing the Board gets attacked for.
@JRomeroCasillas Not denying the history (which isn't pretty). But is there anything specifically which would improve Puerto Rico's economy if it either became a state or independent?
@HCorderoGuzman How do you think remittances would affect labor force participation?
@HCorderoGuzman This gets at an interesting issue, if the people who emigrate are (for whatever reason) more likely to work than those who stay. You could control for observables (education, age, etc) between Puerto Ricans on island vs the mainland, but I'm sure there's more to it than that.
@Sauronpr @Luism_m_cara @FOMBPR Sure, which is why the Board has pushed for a broad range of reforms. For instance, improving Puerto Rico's rankings in the World Bank's ease of doing business ratings. The mainland US is currently #6, Puerto Rico 64th. Will those improvements happen? Right now, I doubt it.

@HCorderoGuzman 3/ I also hear almost nothing about how to raise labor supply. "Increased demand." Over the next five years PR will have fiscal stimulus of over 100% of GNP. That will help. But will the LFPR even hit 50%? I doubt it. So what's the answer -- what's the specific policy(ies)?
@HCorderoGuzman 2/ What I don't understand, because it's not said, is how past US policies toward Puerto Rico cause low labor force participation today. And not just low, but approaching the very lowest in the world. There must be something truly unique &amp; powerful, but what is it specifically?
@HCorderoGuzman No offense, but this isn't an argument. I've never called Puerto Ricans lazy, and the op-ed in fact focused on policies. And of course when Puerto Ricans move to the mainland, where those policies don't apply, labor force participation goes up. 1/

It's others who argue that, despite 3 decades of one of the very lowest labor force participation rates in the world &amp; public policies that textbook economics says produce precisely that outcome, those policies should be ignored.
@EyeOnPuertoRico @FOMBPR @FrankRullan Which sentence, the first or the second? 😀
@HCorderoGuzman Maybe you're right, but I think most economists who have looked at Puerto Rico don't see it that way.
@Luism_m_cara @FOMBPR I get your point, but don't fully agree. Go back (say) 25 years on the mainland. At that time, mainland salaries were no higher than PR salaries are today. Yet labor force participation was much, much higher. The salary level matters, but it doesn't alone determine participation.
@Luism_m_cara @FOMBPR One reason salaries are so low (especially in the middle class) is that paid leave is so much higher than on the mainland. The goal of reducing high mandatory paid leave is to increase salaries.
@HCorderoGuzman If we had a person on food stamps who was NOT looking for work, or is working under the table, where would he be on this table? "Looking for work" is a category, in that you have to say you're looking for work. The reality is the govt doesn't know for sure who is or isn't.
@Mitchell_JoshW @JohnCScott_DC So pretty close.
@Mitchell_JoshW @JohnCScott_DC I was just looking at some SCF questions on retirement income adequacy; those are more comforting. 75% can at least maintain their lifestyle, up from 61% in 1992.		And "totally inadequate" retirement incomes, a subset of those falling short, fell from 26% to 15% of retirees. https://t.co/NEnx8Sjeqt
@gibcruz @FOMBPR For instance: if the employer Social Security tax were increased, the Congressional Budget Office &amp; the Social Security Administration believe all of that costs is passed on as lower employee wages. So you're asking me to reject mainstream economics and invent some new category.
@gibcruz @FOMBPR Just to be clear: the "neoclassical" textbooks you refer to are otherwise just know as economics textbooks, because the vast majority of professional economists believe that employees bear, thru lower wages, part or all of taxes or benefits nominally "paid" by employers.
@gibcruz Let's say an employer is required to give 1 month total paid leave per year. If the employer receives only 11 months work, textbook econ says they're going to pay for only 11 months work. The result is lower wages. Leave is great, but wages are needed more.
@gibcruz And just to be clear for people who may not know: NO state requires paid vacation or sick leave benefits anywhere close to what Puerto Rico requires. Most require nothing at all. And yet employers do offer those benefit voluntarily.
@gibcruz There is nothing wrong with those benefits, but they do get traded off against jobs and wages. Employers wouldn't be prohibited from offering paid leave. But they could also offer more jobs &amp; higher wages, as they do elsewhere in the US where those benefits aren't mandated.
@tavarez77772 @CruzElano @FOMBPR That is the problem: the Oversight Board can't mandate all the reforms that are needed, and the political system can't or won't do it by itself. I'm not optimistic, which is one reason for writing the Washington Post op-ed.
@prwolverine People leave mostly to find jobs. So to encourage employment on the island, improve the business environment, loosen labor laws that discourage hiring, orient the welfare system to encourage work, etc. Some of that's happening, but not nearly enough.

@HCorderoGuzman The next 5 years are the strongest projected for economic growth in the fiscal plan. In my view, too much delay on the PAN work requirements means they'll start only as the fiscal stimulus from reconstruction begins to fade and economic growth falls. https://t.co/j3ec2UAp63

Puerto Rico's political problems aren't at all unique. Illinois has underfunded pensions. The federal govt isn't able to fix Social Security &amp; Medicare, for entirely political reasons. But those governance problems are worse in Puerto Rico &amp; so the task is harder.
I don't blame any party or politician. But I don't believe the political system as a whole in Puerto Rico has internalized the need to change for a different political &amp; economic model if Puerto Rico is to grow &amp; let Puerto Ricans match the standard of living on the mainland.

@CultAnthro19 A broader point on collective responsibility: while this case was egregious, some people always got screwed under DB plans due to the vesting. A Congressional study found that, of DB plan participants in the 60s &amp; 70s, only about 1-in-10 received a benefit. That was the system.
@CultAnthro19 3/ The reality: the costs of well-funded DBs without tight vesting requirements (as in the story) are so high that most employers won't offer them. States do, because they're not well funded &amp; use tighter vesting. But DB vs DC is an academic argument; we're in a DC world now.
@CultAnthro19 2/ DC plans have market risk, non-universal participation &amp; no annuities. But they do increase saving, bc both employers/employees contribute. Plus, no solvency risk. The participation &amp; annuitization problems are fixable, risk not.
@CultAnthro19 DB &amp; DC plans have different kinds of risk. DB plans don't have market risk, but do have solvency risk. Even a well-run DB plan penalizes workers who change jobs or have short careers. This was even worse back in the days when DB plans were more common. 1/
@Frugal_Saver @JoshGotbaum Wiring in @cate_long, who knows far better than I how this plays out...
@CultAnthro19 I stated that, while there are problems with the current retirement system, the specific abuse cited in the article couldn't happen with a 401(k). That's not magical thinking nor is it blaming workers for what happened.
@CultAnthro19 The pension tweet equivalent of "When did you stop beating your wife?"		I have no idea why you'd attribute that view to me based on anything I tweeted.
@LaurieJRowley @CultAnthro19 401(k)s are more widespread today than traditional pensions ever were. And almost no employers went from having a DB plan to having nothing. So, lacking a traditional pension, the chance he'd have a 401(k) plan is very high.
@RPvanGaalen @CultAnthro19 In the private sector this is mostly academic, since DBs are going away. But I believe a lot of these early retirement provisions still exist in the public sector. But they don't lay people off much so these types of problems are presumably rare.
@RPvanGaalen @CultAnthro19 2/ Sure, maybe he could have a bad plan. But you can't produce these kinds of short-term differences with a DC plan. And so it's totally unrepresentative of the current US retirement sector, without any mention of that fact. So what lessons should we draw? Hard to say.
@RPvanGaalen @CultAnthro19 The plan formula as I read in the lawsuit gave early benefits at 55 +10 years of service; his description doesn't quite match up to what I read, but I assume that's what happened. And it's a big hit to his benefits. 1/
@CultAnthro19 It was "collective responsibility" - a traditional defined benefit pension in which he participated throughout his career - that did this to him. If he'd had a 401(k), this simply couldn't have happened. People are totally misunderstanding what happened and why.

@helaineolen From a legal case on the Tulsa closing, it appears M-D took advantage of a benefit increase that kicked in at age 55 &amp; targeted Tulsa because it had many workers in the 50-54 age range.

@investing_in_ed The level is subjective, but the direction of risk much less so. In other words, while I can't say what's the precisely optimal portfolio for a given public plan, it's standard actuarial practice to take less risk as participants age. Most public plans have done the opposite.

@investing_in_ed But it's not plausible that the appropriate level of risk for an aging pension is exactly what produces a predetermined expected return. If they should be taking less risk &amp; they're actually taking more, probably they're taking excessive risk.
@investing_in_ed The CPS actually shows much lower retirement income than those other 4 surveys. I'm also not totally convinced by the CRR brief. It excludes some income categories, which reduces average total income in retirement by about 18%. There may be other issues, I haven't looked closely.
@investing_in_ed But why would a pension with aging participants take on additional investment risk? It should be the opposite.
@Mitchell_JoshW @urbaninstitute @RetirementRsrch @nirs 3/ In other words, the threshold for judging adequacy is uncertain, so calibrating that threshold to self-reported measures of income adequacy for current retirees makes sense to me. Whether it's Gallup, HRS, etc., big majorities of current retirees say they're doing okay.
@Mitchell_JoshW @urbaninstitute @RetirementRsrch @nirs 3/ Urban also finds only a modest decline in preparedness: 31% of Gen-X will have &lt;75% rep rates, versus 27% of pre-Boomers. To me, this makes references to today's retirees relevant: if most say they're financially comfortable (&amp; 80% do) then likely tomorrow's will as well.
@Mitchell_JoshW @urbaninstitute 2/ Urban projects about 31% of future retirees will have replacement rates below 75%; by itself that's more optimistic than the @RetirementRsrch or @nirs projections. Moreover, Urban assumes no use of home equity while CRR assumes a reverse mortgage, so there are real differences

But I'd be interested in how much larger subsidies Cass is thinking of than what we currently have or most conservatives favor. 1/
@stanveuger @MichaelRStrain @JimPethokoukis @swinshi @oren_cass Sure, but if the answer were very low, it wouldn't matter how much control we have. And maybe it's little: I don't know that family breakdown &amp; falling employment happened because we pursued GDP growth too aggressively.
@MichaelRStrain @JimPethokoukis @swinshi @oren_cass Totally!
@JimPethokoukis @MichaelRStrain @swinshi @oren_cass What I think this gets at is akin to @charlesmurray's Coming Apart. What I don't know is whether the changes Charles documents could have been stopped or reversed even if we're willing to give up some GDP growth.
@JimPethokoukis @MichaelRStrain @swinshi @oren_cass How many years of GDP growth would we give up to have the working class employment/household structure of 1965? Not 53 (!) but also probably well above zero. But to me that at least frames an answerable question on what we value.
@AronSzapiro @JanetheActuary @OS_Mitchell So the ME plans (or at least some) were over-funded when discounted using a Treasury yield? I guess maybe back in the day that was possible; tough to believe it now.
@swinshi @oren_cass @JimPethokoukis @MichaelRStrain But also worth asking: how much more well-being - a little or a lot? And how much does it take, and cost from GDP, to get to that work-over-transfers world?
@swinshi @oren_cass @JimPethokoukis @MichaelRStrain It seems Cass is arguing that an economy in which working class households work &amp; support themselves produces greater well-being than one with equal GDP but in which the working class subsists in part on transfers from others.

@FreseMike @Ed_Realist @ShowMe 2/ That's like having a 401k with a 17% total contribution &amp; guaranteed 7.6% annual return, which is a great deal even if you're paying 14.5%. If you adjust the discount rate down to 4%, per the Fed's methodology, the total value of the plan rises to 37% of wages.
@FreseMike @Ed_Realist Missouri Teachers has a high employee contribution (14.5%) of pay, with employer contributions toward the 'normal cost' of new benefits only 2.5%. But (here it gets wonky) the plan assumes a 7.6% return. /1 @ShowMe

@cate_long 3/ But the total risk doesn't decline. If you receive a stock return 1 std deviation below the mean over 25 years - and, by definition, there's about a 1-in-6 chance of that happening -- the pension system will be crushed, because a low return is compounded 25 times.
@cate_long 2/ A more sophisticated view, sometimes touted by pensions, is that the risk (the standard deviation) of stock returns declines over long holding periods. In a sense, that's true: if stocks have a 1-year std dev of 18%, that falls to 5.7% over 10 years &amp; 3.6% over 25.
@cate_long I once thought this, but don't now. A couple reasons. 1st, the graphic uses US data from 1950 to today. That gives you only 3 non-overlapping 20-year periods; not a great sample. Other research, using non-US or longer-term US data, isn't as positive. /1

For low earners, who don't save much to begin with, it's probably a different story.
@carney @TheStalwart @cullenroche @CliffordAsness @AllisonSchrager @AEIecon You're not wrong. But higher taxes mean less consumption by taxpayers, to fund more by retirees. Benefit cuts do the opposite, though offset in part by higher personal saving and longer work lives.

@Terpin8or @AEIecon The closer we get to Social Security insolvency without cutting benefits, the more of the shortfall I think will be made up with taxes/debt rather than benefit cuts. Conservatives (including myself) likely made a serious misjudgment in not cutting a reform deal when we could.

@JoshGotbaum @BrookingsInst In the public plans world, it's not uncommon for actuaries to recommend a lower return &amp; trustees refuse to go along (eg, CalPERS). My point is you can't blame all this on the actuaries. The trustees ultimately set the assumptions &amp; can call for higher contributions, but didn't.
@JoshGotbaum @BrookingsInst Again, I may be mistaken re ME plans, but I believe the investment return assumption usually comes from the plan &amp; its financial advisors, not the actuary. Actuaries can push back if the assumption is 'unreasonable', but the standards set a broad range for that.
@KormanBob The Barron's article doesn't cite it, but there was a Congressional study in the 70s that confirmed that only around 1-in-10 traditional pension participants collected a benefit from the plan. (And once ERISA required plans to actually pay up, employers stopped offering them.)

@AlexGodofsky @Kiffmeister Public plans have several goals. One is avoiding default. But others are intergenerational equity &amp; stable contributions. Even 'well-funded' public plans violate interperiod equity in a big way. And nearly all plans, by taking more risk, are making contributions less predictable.
@Kiffmeister @AlexGodofsky The key question (to me), as I asked GASB at a hearing, was whether taking more investment risk makes a pension "better funded" and thus eligible to reduce contributions. I think the answer should be no, even if funding isn't strictly dictated by a risk-adjusted rate.
@AlexGodofsky @Kiffmeister Personally, I can live with *some* smoothing of contributions, though I think the private pension changes went too far.

@FrancoisGourio @AlexGodofsky @k1ug3 That's correct. In those, the Fed (and the Bureau of Economic Analysis, which actually produces the figures for the NIPA) choose not to use the state/local plans' own published figures, but instead adjust them for a lower discount rate.
@AlexGodofsky @k1ug3 Sure. But when the Fed DOES apply economic insight, as in my lead post, what's the result? Use a discount rate matched to liabilities, not assets.
@AlexGodofsky @k1ug3 Valuing pension liabilities using the assumed return on assets gives pensions (esp the bad apples) an out from reform; instead of reform, they can increase risk-taking, which nearly all plans have done. But yes, within that universe some apples are worse than others.
@AlexGodofsky @Kiffmeister It's possible, but it's tough to see how the Fed could be ~100% funded using a 4% discount rate if contributions are based on a (say) 7% assumed return.
@73Newport I thought they used a GDP-linked discount rate, but maybe I'm wrong. @JohnRalfe1?
@AronSzapiro In the years immediately preceding vesting, I think retention rises - though I don't know how much that really matters big-picture. But plans that have recently increased their vesting requirements have done so to cut benefits to short-career employees to improve plan funding.
The upshot: the Fed has set aside over twice as much funding per dollar of future pension benefits as have state/local pensions. What does the Fed know that state/local #pension trustees don't?
The states value their pension liabilities using high 7-8% discount rates, because (they say) government has special powers to negate risk. So what discount rate does the Fed - which has the power to print money! - use for its own pension plan? Around 4%.	https://t.co/vkHCyzuGRH https://t.co/PHeep8hg9d

@ingloriousBOH @jimtankersley @JohnJHarwood @MarkMuro1 Maybe not, though I was being flip. I don't think local policy has THAT much to do with local productivity.

@Noahpinion @MarcGoldwein I'm not sure how much this matters, but I believe the BLS figures are for the 10th/50th/90th percentiles of wages or benefits, meaning that they may not match up to the same workers. So the chart showing 'low earners' or 'high earners' may not be correct.
@JanetheActuary @CRR It is. SSA and the Urban Institute, who have more detailed/better vetted models, project declining poverty in old age. Vs 2015, Urban projects a 15% cut in under 200% of poverty retirees in 2025, 20% by 2035, etc. https://t.co/0SmkgSHPvZ

Maybe there's another self-reported angle that could be used. I'll check.
@DeanBaker13 True, though probably more so today. In IRS SOI, ~80% of married couples have at least one member actively participating in a retirement plan. And the contribution cap is high enough that most households could save adequately with only one plan. (Not saying this is perfect.)
@investing_in_ed @DeanBaker13 They are working longer, buy that's not the main reason retirement incomes today are so much higher. It's mostly due to higher retirement plan benefits.

@JanetheActuary @OS_Mitchell @RetirementRsrch I think this isn't correct: "In 2004, employers provided a "retirement benefit value" of 7.3% of pay.  In 2017, that dropped down to 6.3%." In BLS data, private employer retirement contribs went from 4.8% to 5.7% of wages from 2004-2018. Total contribs (DOL) 7.6 up to ~8.7%.

@CaraballoCueto Whatever our differences of opinion, PROMESA does not require the Board either to identify essential services or to fund only those services - so there's nothing illegal going on.
@CaraballoCueto Remember, this is a legal process. Policy preferences don't determine that much regarding payment of debt - you pay what you can pay Policy preferences DO play into reforms to raise GDP growth.
@CaraballoCueto Assume we cut expenditures as much as we thought feasible. Remaining revenues go toward debt service. If higher GDP boosts revenues, much of that increase will go to debt. The non-tax increase in GDP, obviously, goes to the public.
@CaraballoCueto More seriously: Puerto Rico is farther out of the "neo-liberal box" than anyplace in the US. I would push for more free markets, less government control and less corruption. Those work pretty well on the mainland.
@CaraballoCueto The fact that government revenues have been growing - after the hurricane's downturn &amp; the subsequent inflow of federal funds - is the "best evidence" the Board's recommendations are ideological? I'd hate to see what the worst evidence looks like. 😀

@RetireRevised 2/ The more relevant policy question is simply whether it's worth paying higher taxes to maintain full promised Social Security benefit. Even if I disagree, you're on much stronger ground on that question. And that's really the question that matters.
@RetireRevised Technically, I think you're wrong on whether 'Social Security increases the deficit.' If, say, one extra person were hit by a car and went on disability, receiving $15k per year, the annual unified budget deficit would increase by $15k. That's increasing the deficit. 1/
@RetireRevised @ReutersMoney @CBPP The reason is that when people refer to "THE deficit" they're almost always referring to the unified budget deficit, which is the sum of the on-budget and off-budget (basically, Social Security) deficits.
@RetireRevised @ReutersMoney If you go back to the 1990s when Social Security was running a surplus - say, this piece from @cbpp - it was taken that those surpluses reduced the budget deficit. With Social Security in deficit, it seems the converse is true - and today, not 2034.		https://t.co/Vk1GPZMLUM

@MUDDLAW @cate_long @Terpin8or @gillamhall @gene_krauss @amontara11 @ThomTillis @TomCottonAR Premature.

Then they definitely get oversight or conditions.
@MUDDLAW @cate_long @Terpin8or @gillamhall @gene_krauss @amontara11 @ThomTillis @TomCottonAR I don't think that part is correct. I've received feelers from certain state officials looking into a federal role.
@MUDDLAW @gillamhall @Terpin8or @cate_long @gene_krauss @amontara11 @ThomTillis @TomCottonAR No, but you can offer things the state doesn't currently have -- like bankruptcy protection -- but in a context that requires a board, a package deal.
@gillamhall @Terpin8or @cate_long @gene_krauss @amontara11 @ThomTillis @TomCottonAR Hard to say, perhaps both more carrot and more stick.
@pnf_phytrade @gillamhall It's no secret the FBI has been looking at various things, which it should. The Board isn't a law enforcement agency &amp; can't/shouldn't prosecute corruption. But when people don't trust their government it has a corrosive effect on the economy and on society.
@Terpin8or @gillamhall @cate_long @gene_krauss @amontara11 @ThomTillis @TomCottonAR It's easy to think of PROMESA in terms of status &amp; colonial history, &amp; I'm not saying those don't matter.

For instance, UPR's retirement system is more poorly funded than about 94% of state/local government retirement plans nationwide, using data from the @RetirementRsrch. That's not healthy or solid.	https://t.co/Otx66Yjbf5

@Wagner2626 @gillamhall @Terpin8or You're right on the Board's power regarding budgets, which is substantial. But budgets are dollar amounts, and (as lack of audited financials show) dollar amounts are fuzzy. Moreover, dollar amounts don't always get at the underlying policy you want to change.
@Terpin8or @JosecirPR They have a LOT of unfunded pension liabilities relative to hard debt, so the eventual rectification will be painful for them.
@JosecirPR That's very true. This isn't unique to Puerto Rico; in fact, very few of the problems I've seen are very different from what you might see in, say, Illinois. Garden-variety poor governance, just 10-15 years further ahead.
@KevinCullen67 @cate_long No.
@cate_long @gene_krauss @Terpin8or @amontara11 @gillamhall @ThomTillis @TomCottonAR Cate, you have to read the statute. If you think essential services aren't being funded, that's ok -- Puerto Rico can pay less debt to fund them. But the law requires only that they be funded, not that every essential/nonessential service be delineated.
@hector_e_valdes @Terpin8or @gillamhall I knew going in that a government that ran its pensions into the ground wasn't exactly well-functioning. But the resistance of the political system writ large to change is sad, because the people of Puerto Rico suffer needlessly. You hope for more.
@cate_long @Terpin8or @amontara11 @gillamhall What's your guestimate of how much govt expenditures would be cut? The problem is that, in a place where government is everywhere, cutting immediately only to "essential" levels would create chaos, economic dislocation &amp; more outmigration.
@Terpin8or @gillamhall Anything's possible. But had we gone that route, things would have gone nuclear from the get-go. Moreover, if you funded only truly essential services govt expenditures would drop so much that the economy would have taken a huge hit. So maybe you're right, but not obviously so.
@gillamhall I'm not blaming any party or official, but I just haven't seen that the political system has truly internalized the need for change. Even after bankruptcy, there's too much business as usual. And that's what made me, at least, so discouraged of late. 2/
@gillamhall Going into PROMESA, I thought/hoped that debt default would cause the govt to reassess the political &amp; economic paradigm. As I (clumsily, rudely, I admit) put it, I was hoping the government would be like an alcoholic who one day woke up &amp; realized that life truly had to change.

@DAVILACOLON @ElNuevoDia I'm not trying to argue with you, but most of the costs of the "the Board" are really costs of the bankruptcy, which happened before the Board existed. Lawyers &amp; financial advisors are incredibly expensive, but those costs would have been incurred regardless.

@unclejohn1000 @jm3wealth @AnnieReporter This @forbes article has a retirement income calculator that incorporates Social Security, pre/post retirement interest rates, longevity &amp; different income levels.

@AronSzapiro @jm3wealth @AnnieReporter Sure. But first we need to get past the (almost universally-accepted) claim that, even on average, we're not saving nearly enough.
@ernietedeschi Good catch.
@jm3wealth @anniereporter DOL Form 5500 data show that total retirement plan contributions are 8.7% of earnings, up from ~6% in the 70s &amp; 80s. Based on this study (which I think overstates saving needs) that's probably enough.
@KarlEgbert Not in a good way. BLS does publish the CPI by metro areas, and some state pensions use these to calculate COLAs. But to really get it right, you'd have to calculate something like a chained CPI-E that omits retiree-owned housing. Possible, but not an afternoon's work.

@CaraballoCueto @ajfernos Pensioners have the clearest legal claim. On average, about 95% of pension liabilities will be honored. Bondholders aren't going to get that much, but maybe they can live with 95% for pensioners. Paying 100% pensions is a finger in creditors' eye. They'll sue &amp; maybe win. 1/
@CaraballoCueto @ajfernos On policy, I've got nothing against some market discipline for bondholders, so the bond markets nationally would pay more attention to state govt budgets and pension funding. But a legal process is different. Bondholders have rights and courts will enforce them. So we disagree.
@Wagner2626 @CaraballoCueto @ajfernos That's not what PROMESA requires; it states only that essential services be funded. I don't know how other muni bankruptcies handled the issue; personally I doubt they did that.
@CaraballoCueto @ajfernos ...bankruptcy is a LEGAL process &amp; everything has to go thru the courts. Courts have different standards, among them the capacity of the debtor to pay its debts. That's something I've had to get used to, as I ordinarily think of things principally from a policy point of view.
@CaraballoCueto @ajfernos Part of the difference is due to updated data, distinct from federal funds. Those federal funds can't be used to pay debt. If, via economic feedback, they increase the capacity to pay debt, then more debt can be paid. Policy-wise one can argue for or against this. But...

@PaulNVandeWater @MarcGoldwein @MichaelRStrain @mattyglesias From a financial planning perspective, which is where COLAs policy lies, you'd start by asking what your costs in retirement are. The health argument for the CPI-E is that retirees' true health costs are higher than in the CPI-W. Ok. But housing costs are lower.
@t3703 @MichaelRStrain @MarcGoldwein @mattyglesias I mentioned the CPI-E in my piece; this is just conceptually a different issue.
@MarcGoldwein @PaulNVandeWater @MichaelRStrain @mattyglesias It's basically the opposite of the health-costs rationale for the CPI-E. While the CPI-W may underweight retirees' health costs, the CPI-E overweights (pretty dramatically) their housing costs.
@PaulNVandeWater @MichaelRStrain @MarcGoldwein @mattyglesias This is a nice recap of the methodology, but doesn't spend much time on the substantive issue, particularly regarding retirees.

@mattyglesias @MichaelRStrain Just from the COLA. Rising home prices are inflation when you buy a home. It's just that homes are a small part of the overall basket of spending by retirees.

@marywalshnyt Taxes (in most cases) are treated as reducing income rather than raising costs, but that's kind of arbitrary.
@s_r_stone @jbarro I'm pretty sure that home maintenance is caught by the CPI. What I was saying was merely that if you own your home outright, a rise in the rental value of your home isn't a true cost to you; you're not actually spending anything on that.
@jbarro A homeowner's housing cost is either zero or their mortgage payment, which doesn't change with inflation. (Excluding taxes, maintenance, etc) I wouldn't count asset growth against COLAs, I just would simply calculate the COLA based on what retirees actually spend.
82% of retirees are homeowners. So rising home prices make them richer, right? But according to the CPI used for Social Security COLAS, they're actually made poorer. https://t.co/fpStLOPNGJ

@JanetheActuary @JohnCScott_DC Social Security is about a trillion a year total; Medicare/Medicaid I think are a bit less than that. Maybe it increases by $11 trillion, but that seems like a lot.
@JanetheActuary @NormaCohen3 How much per murder/dismemberment?
@JohnCScott_DC @JanetheActuary And I think the costs are defined differently: the tax cut cost is the increase in the budget deficit, while the entitlement costs seem to be the total costs of those programs, not the amount by which they boost the deficit.

@PaulNVandeWater @haroldpollack @stanveuger @MichaelRStrain With Social Security, we are where we are - we can't undo those early bonuses. But with Medicare, it does seem appropriate (to me) that contributions should match benefit accruals so we're not consciously screwing future generations.
@t3703 @MarcGoldwein @BobatAbatelli Here are the health weights for the CPI-E. I agree that premiums seem to have a small share vs other categories, especially given how spending is distributed in the Consumer Expenditure Survey. I suspect 'premiums' has a different meaning between the two. https://t.co/wioHtLZWWj
@SteveRo48195125 You're right; I'm assuming (should have been clearer) that over long periods rental and sales prices will rise together. So in any given year it may be off, but since they're potentially the same properties I don't think they'll diverge long term.
@LOTRADER The CPI only includes taxes if they're attached to the purchase price, like a sales tax. Property taxes (and others) are more treated as a reduction in income. But either way, you're right that rising property taxes are in effect like inflation.
@BobatAbatelli Well, I do have experience checking the CPI, which does include health care. The CPI-E weights health expenditures to those made by retirees, which is why my piece mentioned the CPI-E. Apology accepted. https://t.co/l5pto9iOsX

@unclejohn1000 @RussKamp I'm not saying people don't need to save or that all non-savers do ok in retirement. They don't. My point is that factoids that people take to prove Americans are unprepared for retirement don't necessarily show that.
@unclejohn1000 @RussKamp Here's a breakdown of income sources for "non-saver" retirees aged 64-70 in 2016. Total average household income is $39,703. Average household incomes for non-savers approaching retirement in 2017 were $42,962. So the implicit replacement rates for non-savers is about 92%. https://t.co/LvP42tibDY
@rdsva @RussKamp @KampConsulting I think that's just one of those 'how well do you sleep at night' issues dealing with risk. If you work out both your retirement expenses (mortgage, etc.) &amp; estimate your Social Security &amp; asset income, you may feel better.
@JanetheActuary @asymmetricinfo The projection models (eg, Urban &amp; SSA) catch a wider variety of retirement income sources. They also include Social Security, and have better measures of the pre-retirement earnings retirees are hoping to replace. And they just don't show a crisis, at all.

@mattyglesias A pipe dream! One interesting thing is that most retirees, including those with ample income/savings, DON'T maintain their spending in CPI-adjusted terms. Real spending drops considerably, even including health costs. Not sure this should affect COLAs, but still it's unexpected.
@MarcGoldwein It would be interesting (tho a lot of work...) to calculate a chain-weighted, retiree-based CPI that excludes retiree-owned housing. I think that gets a better measure of he changing cost of living for retirees.
@MarcGoldwein touched on this point in his COLA tweetstorm yesterday: https://t.co/rjRJFBD8hc
Rising Home Prices Cause False Increase in Retirees' Cost of Living. @forbes @aeiecon #retirement #COLA #socialsecurity https://t.co/JljemfPWef
@kzahner @PensionTsunami But when we talk about the Social Security deficit, it's calculated after the trust fund is repaid (which it is right now, and will be in full). So even if Social Security surpluses weren't 'spent' (I agree they were), people still didn't pay enough in to keep the system going.
@RussKamp Ok. But if the average retiree even without a retirement plan is doing ok, and if retirees in North Jersey aren't, then some other retirees in other parts of the country are doing better than okay. That's the only way our two data points can be consistent.

@rdsva @RussKamp @KampConsulting It's more that we overestimate what people need &amp; don't think about other sources of income. For instance, in this piece (using that same data) I showed that the average new retiree with NO retirement plan is still doing ok.
@JoshGotbaum Except for me! But in terms of accusing those it disagrees with of dishonesty and bad intent, it fits right in on the Internet.
@RussKamp @KampConsulting A test: using the same data, go back 10 years &amp; see how near-retirees looked then: about three same as today. Now see how they're doing as retirees today. You won't find a crisis.
@RetireRevised I think the reason is that the trust fund is an asset to Social Security but a liability to the on-budget, so it nets to zero.
@RetireRevised Budget accounting is odd. But I'm pretty sure that if Social Security's annual balance declined by some amount - say, 1 extra person claimed disability - that the unified budget deficit would rise by that amount.
Even the Darwin Awards are rigged in favor of men. https://t.co/yfUYG8ETQH
@gillamhall @AndrewScurria This also plays into Medicaid parity. Yes, Mississippi gets a more generous federal grant.

@investing_in_ed @marywalshnyt An investor receives earnings because he gives up the use of his money &amp; because he takes risk. Had those investments not gone to the pension, both contributions &amp; earnings would belong to taxpayers/employees. So it's really ~2/3rds paid by taxpayers, 1/3rd by workers.
@mccanned @MarcGoldwein @MerijnKnibbe @LizAnnSonders @DeutscheBank @SoberLook Its 5% OF THOSE who leave are working. The rest mostly die or convert to retirement benefits. Some recover (or are found to have recovered), but not known if they go back to work.
@MarcGoldwein @MerijnKnibbe @LizAnnSonders @DeutscheBank @SoberLook You can see the same from state to state; those with low unemployment rate have more beneficiaries working. I wonder whether enhancing the EITC could help on that front.
@marywalshnyt That's what you'll read, but I think it's misleading. ALL benefits are funded by contributions. Because those contributions were made in the past, they earn interest. But if you want to know how costs are split between govt &amp; employees, look only at the contribution split.
@meepbobeep @marywalshnyt And spending drives the economy only in the short term; saving drives it longer term. So whether pension contributions would have been spent or saved, there's some cost to economic growth. The pension studies literally ignore this, which is nutty.
@MerijnKnibbe @LizAnnSonders @DeutscheBank @SoberLook @MarcGoldwein Just to follow up, I think the main causes of declining disability rolls are lower inflows and existing beneficiaries shifting to the retirement program as they age. I think beneficiaries actually going back to work is likely a distant third factor.
@AustnNchols @urbaninstitute Plans both received low returns and skilled payments during the recession, with some still doing so. While precise schedules differ, (eventually) the plan has to amortize the loss.
@MerijnKnibbe @LizAnnSonders @DeutscheBank @SoberLook @MarcGoldwein Yes, in inflow has been declining in recent years.
@EyeOnPuertoRico Well, there's that. 😀
@marywalshnyt No, it's nothing as sophisticated as that. The boost-the-economy effect is simply because they ignore the costs of funding the pension. Those 'studies' are terrible.
@FZucchi At any given time it can be a plus or a minus, since today's benefits are paid for by yesterday's contributions so the don't match up year-to-year. But you're right, we may be heading into a less advantageous period...
@rawhideyates @EjmEj It's because pension contributions (&amp; interest on those contribs) are money taxpayers &amp; employees can't spend, and that depresses the economy. Since contributions + interest = benefits, it's a wash.

@Ed_Realist @GregFromCos @MarcGoldwein CT also tracks teacher openings unfilled 1 month in due to a lack of applicants; it's less than 6%. And those occur mostly where a rigid salary schedule might underpay; say math, science, hearing impaired, psychologists. But K-6: 2%; HS history; 1%. It's what you'd expect to see.
@ernietedeschi @Mitchell_JoshW But I don't know if aging plays quite the same role for self-reported disability. For the DI rolls, once you hit age 66 you're off, and so this could be an age-composition effect. Not much recent SSA data, so not easy to tell.
@LizAnnSonders @DeutscheBank @SoberLook @MarcGoldwein I'd love it if this interpretation were true. However, only about 5% of disability beneficiaries who leave the rolls do so by return to work. My guess is a bigger factor is DI beneficiaries hitting the retirement age &amp; switching to retirement benefits.
@chayesmatthew @EjmEj Those 'pensions grow the economy' studies are propaganda. Sure, benefits get respent &amp; stimulate the economy. But pension taxes/contributions can't, and so they 'de-stimulate' it. It's a wash. And the actuary shouldn't be cheerleading this junk.		https://t.co/1SuAKvf4ST

@GregFromCos @MarcGoldwein CT is the only state I know that tracks/publishes the number of qualified applicants per teaching job opening. While it varies by field, the average is 56. That's your teacher shortage.
@GregFromCos @MarcGoldwein So teaching is simultaneously attracting employees with more years of formal education than 95% of the workforce, but also not doing so. Ok.

@GregFromCos @MarcGoldwein MAs in Ed are largely a paper credential, driven by the salary scale, with little evidence that they either signal or impart greater teaching ability.
@GregFromCos @MarcGoldwein I'll be frank: the average salary is $60k, benefits are 2x private sector levels; the work year is roughly 10 months; and there's much greater job security. Are some individual teachers struggling? Sure, as with any occupation. Are teachers as a group struggling? No.
@JohnCScott_DC Leave. Now.
@SteveRo48195125 I looked at teacher's 2nd job wages (as % of total) by state. The avg is ~2%, but I didn't see an obvious pattern, say based on states with teachers protests. Kansas is about average. Sample sizes are small, because so few teachers have 2nd jobs. That tells me the most.
@AppDemography @lymanstoneky A quick check: I got 0.3% poverty among full-time public school teachers.
@SteveRo48195125 Teacher pay does differ from state to state. But it's not straightforward, since costs of living &amp; comparable wages also differ. Even within a state is tricky, because teachers are evenly spread &amp; other well-educated workers cluster in cities, where costs of living are higher.

@JohnCScott_DC @dcjretiresecure Medicaid pays for about 1/3rd of nursing home care; Medicare another 1/3rd; out-of-pocket ~20%, and the rest by insurance or other programs.

@mccanned @JohnCScott_DC @dcjretiresecure Probably, but govt covers most of the risk from LTC care costs.

So it's not just that high costs are unusual, but they're focused on higher-income households.

@TheHRGlobalist @JanetheActuary @AEI It's a little tricky to find in the data that way, because (more educated/productive/whatever) employees who get higher salaries also tend to get higher benefits. But it's a standard view on Social Security that higher employer taxes result in lower wages. Similar on healthcare.
@n_rhee But you still need to account for differences in teacher benefits from state to state. All are substantially more generous than private sector benefits, but some more so than others.
@n_rhee That's necessary, though doing it seems to lower the teacher salary penalty (because many professionals with comparable education live in higher-cost cities). https://t.co/mWGdaScdHx
@n_rhee Time's headline was "This Is What It’s Like to Be a Teacher in America," in which case national averages do tell us something. It would be interesting (really, not just rhetorically!) to see if teachers in the lower-paid states take on more 2nd jobs. Maybe.

@robespierrette @stanveuger True, but it was never as common as people thought. That's why even back in the day, most people didn't get a ton from traditional pensions -- they just weren't in the same job long enough.
@BrighterOregon All the money is going to Oregon PERS! Plus (among other issues, many of which aren't the schools' fault), Oregon has a short school year compared to most other states.
@AEI The Central States retirement plan, even as it looks for a multi-billion dollar federal bailout to pay retirees' benefits, continues to promise current employees new benefits that are roughly 6 times more generous than the average private sector worker's 401(k).
@CitizenVMachine It won't. If you switch jobs with a DB pension, you basically get screwed. (There are more technical explanations, but that's the basic story."
@investing_in_ed Maybe not at the same rate, but the average age of public pension participants is rising. Taking more investment risk in an aging pension, the @SOActuaries said in a 2014 letter explicitly referencing public sector plans, goes "against basic risk management principles.”
For the many retirement folks lamenting the decline of traditional pensions, note that the median near retirees has only 10 years at his current employer. A DB pension for those folks would replace maybe 10% of final earnings, which won't take you very far in retirement. https://t.co/NfFgT6JRl5

@jbarro A very screwed up industry....
@lenburman @crampell Our Judeo-Christian Heritage!
@jbarro This can lead to the oddball result (from work by Ballou &amp; Podgursky) that raising teacher pay would lower teacher quality. Higher pay would crowd the applicant field, lowering the expected payoff to majoring in Ed. That matters more for the better students.
@jbarro There's a subtler argument regarding teacher hiring. Schools don't seem to hire better-qualified applicants when offered; it's a crapshoot. Better students have a bigger opportunity cost from majoring in Ed when they could do, say, computers. For not-so-good students, less so.
@jbarro In a simple model, but there's a lot more going into occupational choice. Say, cash salary is reduced by a short work year; there's also limited upside because of wage compression in the public sector. So I wouldn't expect the very top performers to choose teaching.
@jbarro There's other evidence as well, such as whether teachers who move to other jobs receive higher pay; a number of studies show that they don't.
@jbarro Partly I'm working on the critics' terms. But if you look at other evidence of where teachers stand in the skill distribution of college grads, their they're not above average. Say, the SAT scores of prospective Ed majors are on the low end, same with GRE scores.
@mccanned @jbarro Early on they're higher as a lot of people drop out. But overall they're around the same as other occupations. Very few people who leave teaching cite pay (at least in govt surveys); usually it's other factors.
@SteveRo48195125 I stoop to conquer! 😀
@jodiecongirl @jbarro My dad was a partner at PWC and thought about teaching accounting after he retired -- same story. He laughed and went on to other things
@jodiecongirl @jbarro My point is that the teacher pay gap is pushed along by the implicit assumption that elementary school teachers should be paid more than, say, chemists, architects, financial analysts or aerospace engineers, all of whom have fewer years of formal education. That's nutty.
@jbarro @jodiecongirl Some states are getting rid of the salary bonuses for teachers with Masters' -- N. Carolina and Kentucky come to mind, though I may be wrong.
@jbarro @jodiecongirl If you look at other indicators of smartitude - SAT or GRE scores,  rigor of college major, or AFQT scores in the NLSY - teachers aren't dummies. But they're not one of the very most academically gifted occupations, which is what you'd think from formal credentials alone.
@fultonmn @dutchgirl62 😀
@jbarro College grads are a very broad bucket in terms of college major, school quality &amp; GPA. Nearly every occupation has salaries either above or below the mean for college grads. That doesn't make that occupation over- or underpaid.
@JanetheActuary That's possible, but that's a contractual issues. It's not like a frozen plan is giving up real money.
@JanetheActuary For a state/local plan maybe, but not for a private DB where there's no employee contribution.
@john_zwiers @NormHeske @tomdryan No.
Maybe not. But deeply-underfunded plans like Central States continue to promise generous new benefits to current employees even as they look for a federal bailout. A single-employer plan would be frozen and employees switched to less costly 401(k)s. https://t.co/OC1NjwOFui
@NormHeske @john_zwiers @tomdryan And for a full-career teacher, pensions are often more then $40k.
@wadeeyerly There are shortages in certain areas, and those are mostly the specialized, skilled areas where you'd guess that private sector pay is the highest. But I haven't seen convincing evidence of shortages for, say, elementary school or history teachers.
So if we raised the Social Security payroll tax to 100%, our economy would be, like, way huge! https://t.co/MvcOSexKDD
For those interested in more detail on teacher pay, here's a series of Tweets I put together yesterday that I hope will be interesting/helpful.		https://t.co/bgaBX64wPa
RT @shulsie: You are entitled to your own opinion about teacher pay, not your own facts. Read this thread. https://t.co/93VsL7vto2
@HCorderoGuzman In the ATUS, teachers report both work at school &amp; at home. Total weekly work hours are similar to other professionals, just divided differently. It's really the shorter school year that matters. But I added a month of vacation prep time onto the 9-month school year.
@HCorderoGuzman In more detail worked, I've included both private &amp; teacher paid leave during their work year. Private don't get 1 month, though they do get more than teachers before the shorter work year is included. It doesn't affect the results very much, but means a more complex example.
@AustnNchols If we were calculating hourly compensation for teachers then we'd include the 45% benefits. Tho if we were calculating the value of the summer break, then I guess we'd ask what compensation (inc benefits) they could earn. They're different questions, but I see what you mean.
@AustnNchols 5/ I'd shift pensions toward salaries, so upfront pay is clearly better. Hire a lot of teachers and then weed them out, since teaching skill isn't clearly identifiable from academic credentials. But raising total compensation wouldn't be my 1st step &amp; may not be needed at all.
@AustnNchols 4/ A 3rd issue is that the current movement isn't better pay for better teachers; it's better pay for current teachers. Maybe eventually higher pay means better teachers (or maybe not) but higher pay for all current teachers in hopes of better new hires is incredibly expensive.
@AustnNchols 3/ A 2nd issue is that schools often don't hire better-qualified teachers even when offered them. So higher pay may mean more teacher applicants, but not necessarily better hires.
@AustnNchols 2/ One answer is how compensation is framed: lower salaries, but higher benefits, short work year &amp; strong job protection. That may not be the most attractive combo, given how dissatisfied many teachers currently are with a total compensation package that's not stingy.
@AustnNchols Your real question raises, well, real questions. Say, total average teacher compensation seems to be above what those individuals would likely receive outside of teaching. Why aren't we getting better teachers already? 1/
@AustnNchols I thought about this, but I think you can. Let's say your periodic wage is $100 and you earn $45 of benefits on those wages. So your periodic compensation is $145, which we'd then adjust to an annual level to make it comparable. Maybe I'm wrong, but the issue did occur to me.
@sutirthabagchi That's a nice paper. It probably understates the compensation premium for state/local government employees, because it measures pensions via the employer's contribution, which we know is often inadequate. The NIPA data measure the actual benefits accruing to workers.
@JanetheActuary @JohnCScott_DC @NIRSonline Is it an age at measurement issue?
@pjdoland Meaning 34.5 x 52? That's probably too much. From the ATUS, the weekly numbers are pretty reliable and around 40 (I forget). Figuring out work in the summer was harder, but we thought 10 months total was a reasonable high end.
@ishapiro @mrsshap Have a baby. Hold a bottle. Done!
@john_zwiers @tomdryan It's more than the magic of compounding; it's the magic of a government guarantee of a 7.5% investment return for the pension fund. I'd give up a lot of salary for that.
@AndraRealtorFW Sure, though rural salaries are lower too. My point is that, on average, teacher compensation is fine. Salaries are too low, pensions too much. Maybe in some areas teacher pay is too low. But this isn't a nationwide problem, as Time &amp; others imply.
@hiltzikm That wasn't the question, it was the level of teacher compensation. If it were (was? grammar...) I'm 95% sure that the public sector would do better, even without Social Security. I could check it, but public pensions are WAY more generous than the typical 401k.
@Luissilv2000 @cate_long Probably, but it wouldn't fix the problems. Some pensions are very deep in the hole.

@hiltzikm If a teacher doesn't participate in Social Security, no employer payroll taxes are credited to their benefits. If yes, then they are.
@hiltzikm Josh can speak for himself, but I don't think he would disagree with how I'm doing this for the average teacher. His issue is short vs long-career.
@thebig_d Find my tweets from today.
@hiltzikm That's not what I'm doing. It's just the value of the benefits they're earning each year.
@hiltzikm The NIPA pension figures are the present value of new benefits accruing to employees that year. Payroll taxes for Social Security, health, etc also included.
@DrewMitrisin @MarcGoldwein My estimate of 10 months is based on the American Time Use Survey, where teachers report their own work hours. Teachers do work more at home, but shorter hours at work.
@hiltzikm I dont see anything here I disagree with. Anyway, it was at a conference in Denver maybe 2.5 years ago.
@hiltzikm It was a couple years ago that I formally started arguing that the pension money-loser scenario for short-career teachers probably wasn't right. But big-picture I think Josh's work is great.
@hiltzikm I accept that long-career employees do better than short-termers. My past work on pension liabilities and public sector compensation always implied it would tough (though not impossible) for short-career teachers to lose money on pensions.
@tomdryan Fir a full career teacher, a million or so. I have numbers to back it, but that's a reasonable average.
@beightg @RepTimRyan Happy to answer any questions or objections, if politely phrased.
@tomdryan Per year?
@hiltzikm It's called an honest disagreement - you should meet one sometime. 		See https://t.co/9dXAJgmK7G
@jojacori Not questioning your experience. But there's a lot of research on this &amp; on average, Master's degrees don't seem to make much difference in teacher quality.
@jeffreylharding Based on the American Time Use Survey, where teachers themselves report their work time at school &amp; at home, teachers work about 83% as many annual hours as other professionals. Sure some work more, but others work less. 83% of 12 months is 10 months.		https://t.co/1xYhPQDwVi
I hope this is clearer than some of my earlier tweets. Thank you for your attention. 😀
What could we do? Make pensions less generous, since the average teacher pension is WAY more generous than a 401k, and use the savings to raise salaries. That way, teachers will see the compensation they're getting &amp; have the cashflow they need to pay bills today.
I have zero against teachers &amp; think they should be fairly paid. But the claim, in Time Magazine &amp; elsewhere, that teachers are massively underpaid just doesn't hold up. Sure, some are. And some are overpaid. So fix that. But do we need big across-the-board pay increases? No.
Sources: if you want to replicate these numbers, you can Google SDA ACS for an ACS calculator and BEA NIPA for the benefits figures.
Things teachers won’t like: I’m not giving credit for having an MA, because most research finds MAs in Ed have little/no value-added. Sorry, but it's mostly a credential driven by the salary schedule, not because it makes better teachers.
Things I don’t count: the NIPA benefits don’t include retiree health coverage, which can be worth a lot for some teachers but is worth very little for most current private workers. Also, teachers have more job security and so less risk of being laid off. That's worth something.
So total salary + benefits for the teacher = $83,767. For the private sector worker, total compensation is $78,904. That’s a 6% teacher compensation premium. As in, the average teacher is paid more per month of work than the average private worker with a BA, similar hours, etc.
For private sector workers, benefits in the NIPA are equal only 19% of wages. Health benefits are less generous in the private sector, but the big difference is that 401ks aren’t nearly as generous as public sector pensions. Yes, public sector benefits ARE more generous.
But teacher benefits are more generous. In the National Income &amp; Product Accounts, benefits for public education are equal to 45% of wages. That includes current benefits + the value of new pension benefits accruing each year.
The average school year is about 180 days, or 9 months. I’ll add 1 month for class prep, which is a reasonable high-end estimate. So teachers work 10/12ths as long as other full-time workers. Adjust for that and the annualized teacher salary rises to $57,770, a 13% gap.
For public school teachers employed thru the year and working 35-45 hours weekly, the average 2016 salary in the ACS is $48,142. So based on that, we've got a 27% salary penalty. 		But we need to account for two differences: length of workyear &amp; fringe benefits.
I’ll start with full-year private sector employees in 2016 with BAs who worked 35-45 hours per week. Their average salary in the American Community Survey from the Census Bureau is $66,306.  That's the benchmark.
Ok, for those interested in a teacher pay comparison to other workers. This is simplified, but tries to look at salaries, benefits and work-year in a reasonably understandable way to see what teachers would likely earn in other jobs.
@TBPInvictus @JayFarber @airtattler Or that teacher salaries really aren't that much lower than other jobs?
@TBPInvictus To show that very few teachers actually live in deprivation as Time's fiver story would have you think. Even teacher salaries alone are middle class, but my point was in the examples given by Time.
@MarcGoldwein The Atlanta Fed has an online function (Fedtracker?) that lets you look at wage changes for individuals who were working over the past year, which abstracts from the effects of people entering/leaving the workforce. I think it shows higher wage growth, but I forget by how much.
@investing_in_ed But I wonder if teachers themselves don't get it. In these pay discussions, most teachers focus on their salaries, probably not knowing how much the pension is really worth.
@AnneNewsJunkie That wasn't my point. My point was that Time's examples of people having to share beds with their kids or sell blood aren't typical of a profession that is clearly mostly middle-class. That's all.
@iRussell21 @mderin3y @JayFarber @airtattler That figure is for all households that include a full-time public school teacher, so I narrowed by weeks/hours worked, by occupation and by sector (it has to be local government, to preclude private school teachers). The data source is the American Community Survey, from Census.
@random_eddie I felt guilty because so many people misunderstood what was really a spur-of-the-moment tweet. I should have been clearer on household income vs individual earnings, as well as means vs. medians. Had I not been unclear, *some* of my responses might have been ruder!
@glynnwilcox @LindaWennerstr1 The mode? Thanks, I'll get on that. And I think you'll find I've done a lot of work on teacher compensation.
@DRMartinLLC Different states pay different amounts, ranging from the high $70s to the high $40s, depending on cost of living and average incomes in the state. So it's not all making $60k per year.
@Leishac You shouldn't have to do that. But remember that you can deduct those costs (I think up to $500) on your taxes.
@fightmastermike If you save enough you'll get by, but it's nothing like the traditional pensions most public school teachers receive.
@iRussell21 @JayFarber @airtattler The poverty rate among teachers is about 1.5%. To get that, you'd need a very low teaching salary and a huge household, but I guess it's possible. But again, if you believed Time Magazine you might think different.
@MichaelVitaleJr @chimreaper19 If a Master's actually taught you to become a better teacher the policy might make sense, but (with limited exceptions) it seems MAs don't do that.
@GeneArizona1 @iRussell21 @JayFarber @airtattler I think I did years ago. Public school teachers on average better paid, better benefits. I'll check.
@fightmastermike Do you have a traditional pension? That's big money, much more generous than the typical 401k. Which is one reason to shift money from pensions to salaries: at least teachers will know they're getting it.
@MichaelVitaleJr @chimreaper19 The idea was that by paying more for a Master's we'd get better teachers, but it hasn't turned our that way. Mostly a waste of teachers' time and taxpayers' money.
@iRussell21 @JayFarber @airtattler There's multiple sources for that. In some states the average is in the high 70s, in others the high 40s.
@iRussell21 @JayFarber @airtattler My point was that almost no teachers are living in poverty, as Time would ha e you think. Beyond that, most teachers get near-market levels of pay &amp; benefits, but different kinds of evidence are needed to show that.
@hannahwanebo I'm not saying education shouldn't matter for pay. But not all college degrees have the same market value and not all jobs have the same work year or pay the same benefits. So just because a given job pays less than the average doesn't mean it underpays.
@CogNerd @NumbersMuncher @MarcGoldwein Maybe, but it's not like the average household income is massively more than 2x the average teacher salary.
@hannahwanebo The actual average is around $60k, which is basically half the average for household incomes (so marrying well isn't the issue). But my point was that not many teachers are living in near-destitution as Time claims. I should have been clearer on that.
@zenpundit If the average teacher salary is about $60,000 and average total household income for teachers is $122k, they're not marrying THAT well.
@jennarmathias @SteveDeaceShow The average teacher salary is about $60k and average total compensation including benefits is about $89k (according to the federal Bureau of Economic Analysis). The private sector average for full-time employees is about $60k salary, but only about $12k benefits, for $73k total.
@chimreaper19 The point - which I grant should have been clearer - was simply that, contrary to Time's claims, the typical teacher doesn't live close to poverty.
@JayFarber @airtattler But it's not $60k in California; the average there is closer to $80k. Including benefits the average is probably $120 or so.
@JayFarber @airtattler My $122k figure is the actual average household income for teachers, based on Census data. Some probably have a teacher as a spouse, but others won't.
@MarcGoldwein @NumbersMuncher Entry-level in public policy is gruesome; people will work for nothing and employers know it!
@JayFarber @airtattler It's the overall average. Starting pay is lower, but that's also true with most jobs.
@JayFarber @airtattler The average teacher salary is $60k; a two-teacher household is at $120k.
I'm @biggsag. Which, my wife points out, can be broken down to big sag. And there it is. https://t.co/oh2OZGXAJV
@NumbersMuncher @MarcGoldwein I agree that I should have made the stat clearer. To me it's clear because I use the lingo (say, household vs individual earnings) but normal people can get confused &amp; think they've been mislead.
@kimcommvideo @gwenmoritz @clarkjames70 Pretty sure the articles cite where the data come from. Read 'em.
@BaronBear86 Time's three examples all seemed to be of households where the teacher was the only earner. Teachers already trade some salary for a shorter work year and better benefits, which leaves less cash coming in. And without a second earner it's much harder. But that's not typical.
@LindaWennerstr1 I don't know the media, but the mean (average) is about $60k, though it differs a lot from state to state.
@MarkMcLaren6 @SarahRoseSell @aleckeating_ That's right, and that was my bad. My point was that most teachers don't live in destitution - they're middle class. Not that the average teacher makes $122k; the average salary is about half $60k.
@SeanQPublic Sure, the average household income nationwide is about $74,000. Also note, as i should have before, that this is TOTAL household income including a spouse, if any. The point was that most teachers don't live in the destitution that Time claims.
@FightmasterKim @kallhanson @crm052571 @MattWalshBlog You're working hard &amp; struggling with some costs. I'm not denying that. But Time is talking about teachers who have to share a bed with their child. My point is that these examples, while they make good headlines, are not typical.
@fightmastermike It varies a lot by state. NY &amp; California average in the high 70s, but Utah is only in the high 40s. Cost of living adjusts some of that, and different states have more generous pensions than others. But my point is that, in general, teaching is a middle class job, not poverty.
@fightmastermike So your teaching salary is under the national average. But what you may not realize is how incredibly expensive a traditional pension; they're just much, much more valuable than the typical 3% 401k match a private sector worker gets. Plus health is usually better than private.
@fightmastermike Can I ask what your teaching salary is?
@MarkMcLaren6 It's from the American Community Survey (the former long form of the Census) and it's TOTAL HOUSEHOLD income, meaning that it includes a spouse's earnings if any. The point was that few teachers are destitute, not that the average salary is $122k.
@lemiericle @MattWalshBlog Yeah, I know. I was lazy. But for public sector workers (where the wage distribution is compressed) the difference between means/medians is smaller than in the private sector.
@fightmastermike The average salary is around $61k. Today's benefits (say, health) are more generous than for private sector workers, but the real value is in accruing future pension &amp; sometimes retiree health benefits. Those are MUCH more generous than private sector jobs.
@cloudydays1971 @jenimanon @economisms @BruceBartlett @jasonrileywsj Teacher turnover is high in the first 5 years or so. But after that it's pretty similar to other professions. 	https://t.co/1mN2bylVLi
@Wordjoy @toddeherman The figures are from the Censu Bureau American Community Survey; I ran them myself so no link. But note, these are total household incomes, not just teacher salaries. The point was that most teachers aren't living anywhere close to poverty.
@lbrought @jasonrileywsj This is public school only, but including charters. Private school teachers have lower salaries (on average).
@RhymesWithRight @RobbieCooper True, but: 1) Teachers receive much more generous benefits relative to salary than private sector workers, so the total compensation gap is much smaller; 2. Not all college grads make the same salary; it's a wide range. The engineering grads make a lot, the history majors less.
@ScottScotts2 @kallhanson @crm052571 @MattWalshBlog According to the federal Bureau of Economic Analysis, the average full-time salary in state and local education was about $61k and benefits (both current and accruals toward retirement) were about $28k. Their numbers.
@ScottScotts2 @gwenmoritz Do you really think she sells her blood twice a week? The Red Cross says you need to wait 8 weeks.
@SilerMarriott @gwenmoritz @clarkjames70 2/ The teaching hours comparison is also wrong. For most countries, the OECD relies on teacher's 'contract hours' (say, 8 am to 3 pm). For the US, it uses a survey in which teachers give their total work hours, including grading, etc. The US school day/year aren't crazy long.
@SilerMarriott @gwenmoritz @clarkjames70 The OECD pay comparisons are off because they include only salaries, not benefits. US teachers have much more generous benefits vs salaries (compared to private) than in other countries, where the overall benefit/salary ratio is higher. 1/
@BruceBartlett @cloudydays1971 @mwritter @economisms @jasonrileywsj Come on. If many single-earner households would have a tough time supporting a middle class standard of living, then maybe teachers aren't unusually poorly-paid (which in fact they're not).
@cloudydays1971 @mwritter @economisms @BruceBartlett @jasonrileywsj How many people can easily maintain a middle class lifestyle with only one earner in the household? Probably not many. So the financial struggles of the women highlighted by Time are at least in part due to their having a single income, not simply being a teacher.
@rowenick @bryanculbertson @theREALnickryan Probably the closest counterfactual to what you're thinking of is people who major in Education but then take jobs outside of teaching. I haven't looked in a while, but I don't think that shows a teacher pay gap. Not perfect, but these factoids point in a certain direction.
@rowenick @bryanculbertson @theREALnickryan Sure, but I'm not talking about sky-diving skills; being good at the SAT or GRE seem pretty related to a career in education.
@kallhanson @crm052571 @MattWalshBlog The obvious response is that teachers own pay should be fair. And they should be, and I've written a lot about that. But it was Time's Grapes of Wrath-type examples I was responding to. I should have been clearer, since obviously a LOT of people thought I was misleading them.
@kallhanson @crm052571 @MattWalshBlog I said average household income, with includes spousal income. This wasn't to deceive (and wonk-types wouldn't have misunderstood it) but to show that most teachers don't live in near-destitution as Time's examples claim. They live middle class lives.
@riacton @rowenick @bryanculbertson @theREALnickryan Two problems I see: First is that as one spouse's earnings rise, the other may stay home. What you want to compare is human capital. But teacher educational (because of weak undergrad degrees &amp; and dubious MAs) probably overstates human capital vs other college grads.
@Tristan_Boyce1 Your salary is below-average for a teacher, which is ~$60k. But my point was regarding TIme's examples of teachers who are barely getting by; in reality, most teachers (due to their salaries &amp; those of spouses) live better than the typical household.
@rowenick @bryanculbertson @theREALnickryan You can also look at GRE scores or at AFQT scores from respondents in the NLSY. Same result: no big pay gap. So maybe the counterfactual career would lead to higher compensation, but I haven't seen much evidence to support that conclusion.
@rowenick @bryanculbertson @theREALnickryan You can't take a prospective teacher and force them into a different occupation. But you can, say, look at the SAT scores of people majoring in Ed vs other subjects. Or you can look at the BLS's assessment of occupational skill requirements. Neither show a pay gap.
A Kentucky teacher with a $55k salary is probably getting a total compensation package including benefits of $85k or so. It's the benefits that are crushing state/local government budgets, but the benefits get ignored in these conversations on teacher pay. https://t.co/Ag9UssgLCm
@UnnhappyCamper @StepCArmstrong It's just like real life!
@Holtmoney51 @RameshPonnuru Different costs of living even that up a bit. But there are much different levels of all incomes across different states, so it's not clear how that should play out for teachers.
@berthyman @BruceBartlett @jasonrileywsj Exactly: should the local households with a median income of $38k be paying higher taxes so local teachers get higher salaries? I don't know.
@rowenick @bryanculbertson @theREALnickryan Yes, and for an industrious researcher this would be a great project: infer whether teachers are over/underpaid based on their spouse's earnings, since assortative mating means spousal earnings are increasingly similar. For technical reasons it may not work, but still interesting
@rowenick @bryanculbertson @theREALnickryan If you want to measure relative pay, yes, and I've done that; see below. But if you want to know whether teachers are living in absolute deprivation, which is what Time highlights, then straight dollars or poverty rates are the right measure. 		https://t.co/efep8im4bX
@rowenick @bryanculbertson @theREALnickryan But a) Oregon has a supergenerous pension package, even today; by itself that's worth at least an extra $8,000; and b) MA Ed. degrees are widely agreed to be useless, neither imparting greater teaching skills nor signalling that the holder is a better teacher.
@UnnhappyCamper @StepCArmstrong Yes (if there is one). The point wasn't on teacher pay itself (although I've written a lot on that), but about how many teachers are actually financially struggling in the way Time's examples claim is typical.
@EmmettOFarrell @gwenmoritz @clarkjames70 @TIME I live in a rural area. I think teachers probably struggle financially more in cities, where the cost of living can be very high.
@rog2217 @gwenmoritz That was exactly my point: “This Is What It’s Like to Be a Teacher in America” is just grossly misleading.
@kallhanson @crm052571 @MattWalshBlog The average school does, when benefits are included. People (public or private sector) have no idea how much health/pension benefits actually cost, but it's a lot!
@bryanculbertson @theREALnickryan To someone who works with data, citing 'household' clearly implies, well, the whole households. Plus the average teacher salary is incredibly easy to check. I should have been clearer, since obviously the tweet has been misunderstood, but if I was lying I'm very bad at it.
@IronEconomist In none of the three cases Time highlights is there mention of a spouse with a full-time job. It's simply hard to maintain a middle class standard of living with one earner, but that's the economy overall, not something specific to public education.
@SusanT01 @RameshPonnuru This chart shows average teacher salaries by state, but adjusted for differences in states' costs of living. In some cases, like Hawaii, cost of living matters a lot. https://t.co/FaBjkIygFo
@john_busbin @jasonrileywsj The average teacher salary today is a little under $60k.
@gwenmoritz @macmomma123 @clarkjames70 @TIME But there's another issue for teachers vs college grads comparisons: there's a huge variation in pay for college grads, based on differences in jobs, skills &amp; credentials. Simply because a given college grad earns less than the average doesn't make them underpaid.
@gwenmoritz @macmomma123 @clarkjames70 @TIME I've done a massive amount of work doing that. Teachers receive somewhat lower salaries, but much higher benefits. The EPI stuff cited by Time showing a huge pay gap has got real problems on how the numbers are generated.
@jennarmathias @SteveDeaceShow Mean-to-mean total household income (including spouse, if any) is $122k to $74k. I don't have median teacher household income yet, need to download some data. But the comparison will be similar.
@crm052571 @MattWalshBlog Higher wages by itself won't necessarily result in better teachers (for complicated reasons). But higher wages combined with dismissing the poorer performers - like law firms do - probably would. But that's very hard, again for complicated reason.
@mrrandytlgches @CuriousGOrwell @jasonrileywsj @TIME Based on what teachers themselves report, their average weekly work hours are about the same as other white collar jobs. Fewer hours at work, more at home, but the total isn't high compared to comparable jobs.	https://t.co/1xYhPQDwVi
@stumanchuwpg @gwenmoritz @clarkjames70 Something tells me Time was exaggerating in that case. If you donated blood twice a week I think you'd be dead.
@gwenmoritz @TwebbSMfootball My point (which obviously I could have stated more clearly!) is that by and large teachers aren't in financial insecurity, at least compared to the typical person. Some teachers have financial difficulties, but that's the case in most jobs.
@mrrandytlgches @CuriousGOrwell @jasonrileywsj @TIME I get it, but a lot of people spend personal money on work-related stuff. And teachers can deduct any spending on their tax returns, which other ordinary employees can't. So I'm not saying it doesn't matter but I think other factors are more important.
@CuriousGOrwell @mrrandytlgches @jasonrileywsj @mrrandytlgches is right that the average teacher doesn't make $122k; they make a little under $60k. My point was that very few teachers live in the absolute levels of deprivation that @time's cover photos claim is typical for teachers today. It's just not.
@BruceBartlett @jasonrileywsj Honestly, does this look like shit you to? Average all-in compensation of $89k? What it is is heavy on the benefits - which are crushing state/local budgets - and lighter on salaries. https://t.co/zfFuLaTf7n
@crm052571 @MattWalshBlog Average teacher COMPENSATION (salaries + benefits) isn't low, about $89,000 on average. But teachers should make more in salary &amp; less in pensions and other benefits.
@AlexanderBurned @MattWalshBlog From Census Bureau data. Those figures were for total HOUSEHOLD income, including a spouse if any. I wasn't intending to deceive. The point wasn't about teacher wages, but about how many teachers live in deprivation as described by Time's cover examples. The answer is not many.
@dutchgirl62 If you're single, you still have a salary that's above average &amp; benefits that are WAY above average. Yes, it's much harder if you're single, but that's true for anyone who's single, not just teachers.
@BruceBartlett @jasonrileywsj Nationally: since 1998, real per employee compensation in public education has grown by 37%; in the private sector, only 25% (BEA). Since 2000, teacher wages have grown at about the same rate as other college-educated workers (Census.) So sorry, it's not bullshit. https://t.co/5dAu0JtOCG
@BruceBartlett @jasonrileywsj Oklahoma teachers ARE among the lowest-paid in the country; not good, but also not typical. But even in OK, teacher pensions are far more generous than private sector, worth an extra 23% of their salaries. 	https://t.co/efep8im4bX
@BruceBartlett @jasonrileywsj Look at the cover pictures and the statements made there. They're about material deprivation, which simply isn't that common.
@BruceBartlett @jasonrileywsj I wasn't making a point about relative wages, though I'm happy to talk those. It was about whether the deprivation claimed by Time was typical. And it's simply not.
@BruceBartlett @jasonrileywsj Take the Kentucky teacher Time highlights. She makes $55k teaching, then works a 2nd job at night, then does tours with her husband on weekends, then donates blood 2x per week. What's the median household income in Versailes, KY? $38k. All-in, she's at 2x the median.
@BruceBartlett @jasonrileywsj Well, the evidence they're actually paid like shit is weak. But my point was that the material deprivation Time claims is typical is actually very atypical.
@ScottGoldstein @smarick Time's profile of these teachers wasn't whether they we're earning as much as they could in other jobs. It was about deprivation - can't pay the bills, must donate blood, etc. My point was that this deprivation is very rare, such that Time presented a distorted picture.

@llovemyboys Honest question: The median wage today is a bit over $30,000. You have 21 years of job tenure and make less than that?
@citation_needed @LeonHewer @RayMcCue Just fyi that for public sector employees the mean/median are pretty close because of wage compression. I should have run the median (and will) but to do that I neeed microdata, which you can't download on a plane. The qualitative conclusion doesn't change.
@avishr @salimfurth Because I was on a plane and couldn't download the microdata to get the median teacher income. But the mean household income is $74k, compared to households with a teacher where it's $122k. The point is simply that, despite what Time says, most teachers aren't living in poverty.
@TrumpZombieCult @MarcGoldwein Exactly. The point is I was making is that most teachers don't live hand-to-mouth as portrayed by Time. That's a different question than whether teacher salaries themselves are fair (though the evidence on that says they basically are).
@gwenmoritz @clarkjames70 @TIME The federal government pays less-educated workers much higher wages/benefits than the private sector. The CBO finds that for workers with "some college" total federal compensation is 41% above private levels. I'm not sure what comparing to over-generous federal pay tells us.
@gwenmoritz @clarkjames70 @TIME Read the rest of the paragraph: once more-generous pensions are included, teacher compensation (salary + benefits) compares well to private sector jobs. So why not shift some of those generous pensions to salary? 	https://t.co/efep8iDFAx
@gwenmoritz @clarkjames70 @TIME I'm not sure what you're referencing here regarding teachers with associate degrees and federal benefits.
@gwenmoritz @clarkjames70 @TIME I'm not sure what you mean by "demonstrably underpaid." But a headline that reads "This is what it’s like to be a teacher in America" &amp; follows with atypical examples and dodgy statistics is misleading to readers.
RT @gourdnibler: So dramatic! Dude from the weather channel bracing for his life, as 2 dudes just stroll past. #HurricaneFlorence https://t…
@Mike_Barnett It shows the average teacher aren't in face living the Dickensian life portrayed by @Time. Moreover, teacher's spouse's salaries aren't that higher than teachers own pay, so it's not a matter of finding Mr. Big if a teacher wants to be upper-middle class.

@oceanbreeze44 The data are from the Census Bureau's American Community Survey; they show average total household income for public school teachers in 2016, in other words, including spousal income if married. The point is that most teachers are upper middle-class, not poor.
@OnePolitikow @BankableInsight That statistic shows the average total household income for public school teachers; if they're married, their spouse's salary is included. The point wasn't about teacher salaries, but that the average teacher lives an upper-middle class lifestyle, not this Grapes of Wrath stuff.
@Coeleborn But what should Google have told me that I missed?
@Coeleborn Really?
@gwenmoritz @clarkjames70 Sorry, I was on a plane w/o wifi. I've written a lot on this. Here's two recent short pieces, though I have long ones as well:	https://t.co/GMww2XDWak	https://t.co/efep8iDFAx
@BudgetBen @ptuns Not in these data, actually. For the national accounts, employee pension compensation is calculated as the value of new accruing benefits. It's true that rising pension debt costs may have squeezed wage growth, but even then total annual teacher compensation is up significantly.
@ptuns From 1998- 2016, the average per employee compensation in public education rose by 37% above inflation (from the National Income and Product Accounts). For private sector workers, average compensation rose by only 25%. Most of the growth in education was from benefits.
@Mitchell_JoshW @JohnCScott_DC These are ACS household incomes.
@BitterCaptain The work week (including work at home) is about 40 hours, though the work year is shorter. No adjustment for these numbers, though.
@SoapboxO @Sean177Sean What I'm implying is that, contrary to @Time's claim, not many teachers have to share a bed with their child, sell their plasma, or not fix their car.
@aarmlovi Yes, though blue state salaries often get clawed back a bit through higher costs of living.
@Sean177Sean Look at the Time covers; they're not about teachers not making as much as other college grads, but of teachers having to sell their plasma &amp; sleep with their kids. Even using teacher's own salaries that's a big stretch, but with total household incomes even more so.
@divainaz @willchamberlain The avg teacher salary in AZ is about $48k after 12 years of experience. But my real point - contrary to @Time - is that most teachers aren't selling plasma, sharing beds with their kids, etc. Their average household incomes (inc spouse) are solidly upper-middle-class.
@nickschulz I bet you do.
@Terpin8or @MSFalk @TIME I'm going to have to learn to do that...
@Brian_VA24 @spengjr No, because most teachers don't marry doctors, lawyers or bankers. Yet, on average teachers nevertheless live in upper middle-class households.
@MSFalk The mean household income is $73k. But the point of looking at household income is to show that @TIME's dustbowl-type images are sensationalism. Sure, some teachers are underpaid &amp; some struggle. But on average teachers live in comfortably upper middle-class households.
@richardflair And that's worth something.
@gwenmoritz There's a pro/con literature on that, which I can point you to. But that's not what Time was getting at. They're pointing to examples of absolute deprivation, where people need to sell their blood to get by. That's not close to typical given the income levels teachers have.
@jpaulm0201 For all households, the mean (average) household income is $73,000., vs a median of $59,000. For teachers the mean &amp; median will be closer to each other, I just can't produce the median teacher income  where I am now (a plane).
@eastgate @henryolsenEPPC The mean household income for all households is about $73,000.
@eastgate @henryolsenEPPC Usually I wouldn't mix them, but I'm on a plane and can't download microdata to get median teacher household incomes. But public sector pay is compressed, so the median/mean will be a lot closer than with private sector workers.
@spengjr Correct. Teacher health benefits are a bit better than private sector; teacher retirement benefits (pension + often retiree health coverage) are much better.
@yourlyingeyes Exactly.
@jpaulm0201 Neither number tells us whether teacher pay is 'fair'; that depends on what teachers would likely earn in other jobs. (The answer to that is, about what they earn in teaching, but with less generous benefits.)
@jpaulm0201 The average teacher salary by itself is a little under $60,000, which is equal to the typical total household income. But if you want to know if teachers (on average) are struggling financially, household income is a better number.
@BudgetBen There's a reasonable amount of research looking at how people's salaries change as they move into or out of teaching. The results aren't what the underpaid-teacher thesis would have you expect...
@spengjr No, it's just the teacher salary (as actually paid, not annualized based on shorter work year) plus any spouse salary.
The average household income of a public school teacher in 2016 was just under $122,000, more than double the median income for all US households of $59,000. https://t.co/3aLfYTlm6v

@jonathan_repp @HigherEdActuary The additional return paid on a risky investment is compensation for that risk, so a simple point estimate of the return while ignoring greater volatility (and thus potentially higher sponsor contributions) tells only half the story.
@530BruceRoss Lowering the assumed return isn't necessary a reduction of investment risk; in most places, it's just the realization that previous assumptions were optimistic. CalPERS has talked of moving out of hedge funds, etc. but I don't know how much the actual allocation has changed.
@HigherEdActuary I was looking for a synonym for 'gamble' that wasn't quite so pejorative... 😀
Why? Because, despite claims that pension contributions aren't a burden on state/local budgets, these govts *really* don't want to raise contributions even further. So, contrary to pension best practices, they're trying to risk-premium their way out of the problem.
Standard actuarial practice is that as a pension's participants grow older the plan should take less investment risk. Public sector plans ignore this. I'd be surprised if there were a single public plan in the country that's taking less risk today than 10 or 20 years ago. https://t.co/fb36v0xKkq
@JohnRalfe1 Mick Taylor says that when he first played with the Stones he was shocked at how sloppy they were...
@cate_long Something similar happened in Detroit, where the pensions appeared decently-funded in part due to a pension obligation bond, which the city then defaulted on. I wonder if Chicago can do the same thing if the debt is *truly* securitized by the tax.
@cate_long If they're going to borrow at 5-6%, this is an insanely risky move. There's a huge chance of losing money.
@AllisonSchrager There's only so much a liberal society can tolerate.
@AllisonSchrager I'm feeling queasy just thinking about this combo.
@investing_in_ed Partly it's just that providing what a DB plan does - guaranteed benefits - is expensive. Risk-sharing plans could reduce sponsor costs while keeping a DB-like framework. But there's a real devil in the details in ensuring that trustees don't kick touch choices to the future.
@investing_in_ed The only terms on which employers will offer DB pensions is if they're weakly funded like state/local or multiemployer plans. And those plans carry obvious risks of their own, either to participants or to taxpayers. Well-funded pensions don't, but people don't want to pay.
@n_rhee @530BruceRoss 4/ This isn't the biggest issue; I think a shrinking gender pay gap in the private sector is a bigger factor in EPI's finding a bigger salary penalty for teacher today. But the educational controls are a problem.
@n_rhee @530BruceRoss 3/ Big-picture, EPI is comparing teachers to a better-educated set of sector workers today than in the past, even if teacher MAs don't seem to cause recipients to become better teachers.
@n_rhee @530BruceRoss 2/ But it also skews pay comparisons. The teachers MA salary bump is smaller than for private workers, so more teacher MAs makes teachers more “underpaid.” But that's crazy: teachers willingly did it, &amp; in any case MA. Eds probably don’t impart the same skills as other MAs.
@n_rhee @530BruceRoss Over time, schools encouraged teachers to get MAs via higher salaries. Teachers responded to incentives &amp; many more have MAs today than in the past. This was largely a mistake - teacher MAs neither identify nor impart higher skills, so it was mostly a waste of time/money. 1/
@HCorderoGuzman @EconomicPolicy That's why you need me here, to correct your false confidence!

But at lot are switching from medical to recreational - there's just more money in it. Medical is cheaper (lower tax) but you have to get a doctor's card, so recreational seems to win out.
@cate_long @revenga_v4 @pedromarrero51 @GjPortela Yes, but very little data to date. Oregon's been 2 years, and less than that on the data side. Anecdotally results are mixed. Plus, it's not obvious what measure indicates success. No resolution soon.
@revenga_v4 @pedromarrero51 @cate_long @GjPortela Once recreational comes in the medical side gets squeezed. Overall, Oregon has such oversupply today that prices have dropped by 1/2. Here at least there was a bit of a bubble.
@revenga_v4 @pedromarrero51 @cate_long @GjPortela States like Oregon are desperate for money (to pay pensions). That's the real  rationale for legalization. So they need a high tax rate, but that leaves the black market in place. Nothing's perfect...
@revenga_v4 @pedromarrero51 @cate_long @GjPortela In OR, apparently 70% of the current market is illegal. Maybe that changes &amp; other good things happen. But there are downsides &amp; so far here it's not a no-brainer to legalize. Research to be done!
@pedromarrero51 @cate_long @revenga_v4 @GjPortela Big picture: I used to be 100% pro-legalization. Now I live in a poorer area where so many people live on a knife's edge between success &amp; failure. There's so little room for error &amp; so many ways to go wrong. Certainly the tax revenues aren't worth it.
@pedromarrero51 @cate_long @revenga_v4 @GjPortela It's really happening as we watch, so most studies (which are on medical marijuana) are already out of date. The near-term stuff - say, the black market - isn't tough to see, but longer-term effects like education are hard to say.
@cate_long @revenga_v4 @pedromarrero51 @GjPortela Legalization plus insufficient $ for inspections lets illegal grows 'hide in plain sight' - if it's everywhere, you can't tell legal from illegal. And high pot taxes (20%) let illegal pot undercut the legal product. Illegal growing in OR &amp; CO is much higher today.
@revenga_v4 @cate_long @pedromarrero51 @GjPortela I'm not sure that's all of it, but time will tell.
@cate_long @revenga_v4 @pedromarrero51 @GjPortela It's tough to do. The revenue side is well known, although prices are dropping as the market gets flooded. The costs are tougher. Law/code enforcement not too hard. Workplace absenteeism/injuries &amp; educational effects inferred from studies. The black mkt doesn't really shrink.

@MSFalk I actually don't think the smile pattern (higher spending at beginning &amp; end of retirement) really holds. Even when out-of-pocket health costs are included, expenditures in old age seem to be lower than early/mid-retirement.
@revenga_v4 @cate_long @pedromarrero51 @GjPortela This is entirely separate from my Board work, but my state (Oregon) has legal pot. I'm not at all sure the tax revenues exceed the cost. Looking at my neighboring county, their additional code/law enforcement costs are 3x what they'll get in taxes.

@MSFalk @WSJ This piece pays almost no attention to all the other research on how much people need in retirement and how much they actually spend. If you run a blank-slate analysis that comes up with a number nearly twice the standard baseline, it's time to double-check things.

@530BruceRoss @n_rhee The school year skews it all along. I think the change is driven by rising numbers of teachers with Masters degrees, so the regression is comparing to higher-paid private workers; and the shrinking private-sector gender wage gap, which lowers female teacher pay vs private women.
@n_rhee EPI doesn't accurately account for teachers' shorter work year &amp; assumes that an MA in Ed has the same market value as other Masters's degree. 		One interesting factor: the shrinking private sector gender wage gap raises private female pay, making teacher pay appear lower.
@OliviaJGonzalez The 'short-career teachers losing money on their pensions' conclusion is driven by valuing those benefits using an inappropriately high discount rate. Value them properly - using a low discount rate to reflect those benefits' safety - and there are very few teachers who lose out.

@Terpin8or Of course. But without a stronger economy, cutting spending alone won't fix the problem. And freeing up the economy is really the hardest part.
@lenburman @MarcGoldwein Everyone's a comedian!
@Terpin8or I get your point, but I don't think that does it. You need a government that truly wants reforms; a political system that is willing to accept them; and a civil service that can implement them. It's on the first point that I'm most optimistic, but it goes downhill from there.
@dcjretiresecure I'm not sure about that, but I'll check.
@Terpin8or That's what I'm afraid of.
@dcjretiresecure I may be missing this. In these calculations I *think* a dollar of retirement savings would produce the same retirement income as a dollar of accrued Social Security benefits.
@dcjretiresecure What I mean was that if the US has retirement savings problem, it's less than that of other developed countries that have smaller pension funds. (Most also have worse demographics for their paygo pensions.) If we've got a retirement crisis, other OECD countries face armageddon.

@MarcGoldwein @BLS_gov @WSJ @MDuppler @NKaeding @StevyB @AllisonSchrager @greg_ip In some work underway using the PSID, I find that for households with kids, spending starts to decline in their 50s as kids become independent.

@MarcGoldwein @BLS_gov @WSJ @MDuppler @NKaeding @StevyB @AllisonSchrager @greg_ip This chart will be a bit off, because it compares people of different ages in the same year, which isn't the same as how a single birth cohort's spending will change as they age.

@cabaum1 @DanaBashCNN @CNNSotu Nope; not my thing. But (and maybe studies address this) once you account for lower non-Medicare spending, the tax rate necessary for Medicare for All would be lower because, as employer health contributions fells, wages should rise by a similar amount.
@herbwhitehouse The @uscbo analysis (as well as my own similar work) includes the value of DB pensions, calculated as the normal cost of the pensions at a risk-appropriate discount rate, minus the employee contribution. Federal wages are close to private levels, but pensions much more generous.
@MrJoshPerry Of the four, Bill Clinton is the only one who hasn't at least flirted with anti-Semitism. Remember Sharpton at Crown Heights and Jackson's 'Hymie-town' comments?

@cabaum1 @DanaBashCNN @CNNSotu Because they're focusing only on the taxes needed to fund the plan, not any savings from other sources. I'm not saying this vindicates Medicare for All, but we want to count both sides of the equation.
@paulkrugman, would it change your opinion on federal employee pay if you knew that @uscbo finds the federal government pays an average of 17% above the private sector, not the 3% premium you claim in your article?		https://t.co/g99PclOFjW https://t.co/XgPQZUZqwc
@MikeOtsuka @JohnRalfe1 In the US, public plans and their actuaries are fighting hard against having those figures even calculated.
@MikeOtsuka @JohnRalfe1 Even if taxpayers aren't on the hook (they may well end up so; Google 'multiemployer pensions' for the US, which are underfunded precisely by using loose accounting) future stakeholders may bear the burden of higher costs &amp; lower services. It just seems odd not to disclose that.
@MikeOtsuka @JohnRalfe1 It's one thing to base funding decisions on expected returns. But the liability measure should include the costs of returning to the taxpayer in the future should assumed returns not materialize. Your cite notes this contingent liability, but they simply choose not to value it.
@cabaum1 @DanaBashCNN @CNNSotu To be fair, if Medicare for All displaced private coverage then households' take-home pay wouldn't be cut: they'd paid higher taxes, but they and their employers would pay less for private insurance.
@MikeOtsuka @JohnRalfe1 In this piece I tried to explain, in a reasonably understandable way, why the expected return on assets isn't the right discount rate to use for a pension offering guaranteed benefits. It's not immediately intuitive, but hopefully this helps.  https://t.co/2NMBR87XNq
@HCorderoGuzman @marceljcastro @CaraballoCueto @ceprEspanol Definitely, a 401k has different demands &amp; different risks. But with a defined benefit (DB) pension, you're essentially lending money to the government &amp; counting on it to pay you back. These days, not just in PR but all around the country, that's becoming a riskier proposition.
@HCorderoGuzman @marceljcastro @CaraballoCueto @ceprEspanol I don't think one exists yet for UPR. For a late-career employee annual DB accruals are often negative once the employee contribution is included. At those ages a 401k is often a better deal. I may be wrong, but my gut for the original questioner is a pretty modest reduction.
@rawhideyates @AEI @EjmEj @nytimes Could you please ask Arnold to send me my money? I think the check got lost in the mail.
@MikeOtsuka @JohnRalfe1 This is a core difference of opinion: nearly all economists believe that the discount rate for a liability should e set based on the risk characteristics of the liability itself, not of assets used to fund that liability.
@rawhideyates @AEI @EjmEj @nytimes Actually, not.
@marceljcastro @HCorderoGuzman @CaraballoCueto @ceprEspanol Retirement benefits will be reduced, but by less than the 10% for ERS; reductions would still be progressive. Going forward, employees will participate in a defined contribution account similar to a 401k. Your total loss, while not nothing, won't be huge.

@Mitchell_JoshW @JoshuaTMcCabe I've seen some research (can't remember now; I'm on a plane) finding that the EITC did create a transfer to employers, but it was all due to higher labor supply pushing down wages. But pretty much any policy that encourages work could have that effect.
@t_rex_landshark @JoshuaTMcCabe The claim is that government benefits allow Walmart, etc to pay less, meaning that w/o those govt benefits low-pay workers would get paid more. If so, much of the Great Society was a waste of time (and money).
@gene_krauss @gillamhall No question. My concern is the former isn't happening at all.
@JoshuaTMcCabe If you believe it, this implies that we've wasted an enormous amount of taxpayer money on these programs.
@JohnCScott_DC @ceprdc Sure, I get it. But still, there's a difference between walking and swinging a sledgehammer, and it's useful for readers to understand the distinction.
@gene_krauss @gillamhall I think the key is internalizing that the economic model has to change; it's not just a matter of taxing a bit more and spending a bit less, but working for a more flexible, innovative and productive economy. A government that goes bankrupt needs more than incremental changes.
@Elliot_Lake @ceprdc Ah, Twitter. In fact, I'm just relying on the figures in @ceprdc's own study, which finds around 5% of older workers in highly-physically demanding jobs. So take it up their "suit-clad asses"; I live in rural Oregon, where there used to be logging.
@ceprdc The definition of "physically demanding" used here includes pretty much any physical demand - say, walking. A better focus might be on highly physically demanding jobs, which is what you think of when you see a guy with a sledgehammer. That's maybe 5% of older workers.
@PaulNVandeWater Yup. It's basically one big pension obligation bond. All mistakes have been made, but not all levels of government have (yet) made them!
@mrsshap @IWF @marcorubio And that assumes that parental leave had no positive impact on mothers' earnings once they return to work. If earnings rise as they did in CA, Social Security retirement benefits go up.

@tghilarducci @tarasbernard Teresa, the study @nytimes cited found that retiree bankruptcies hadn't risen since 2001. The increase from 1991 to 2001 was likely accounted for in part by 1994 legislation which, the Fed said, “actually encouraged bankruptcy by increasing personal property federal exemptions.”

Bad (or no) regulation is the problem, but often pension stakeholders don't want to be regulated. It's a mess.
@HCorderoGuzman @JosecirPR Maybe, but these pensions were underfunded long before those tax cuts took place, so canceling them isn't going to make the plans fully-funded. If you don't force sponsors (govt or private) to fully fund their pensions, they won't. If you do force them, most won't offer pensions.

@PensionDialog A market value of pension liabilities is decision-useful in that, in conjunction with the standard expected-return value, it shows how much of a plan's stated funding is based its assets &amp; how much on the assumption of receiving a risk premium that isn't guaranteed.

@LiberalEcon @AEI @SocialSecurity @NationalAffairs No offense, but based on this I don't think you understand what I've written (which itself was several years ago &amp; only then to debunk what I saw as faulty reasoning). If you're actually interested I'll explain what I think, but I'm not getting into a Twitter argument over this.
@marywalshnyt But I think a big part of the appeal of POBs is that you don't have to pay now; costs are pushed off to the future. Both the public and politicians are very much in favor of that! @meepbobeep
@NormaCohen3 This story is a little dated, but gives some detals: https://t.co/YycvIw84tw
@RetireRevised Plus, a lot of blockchain discussion is just bullshit...
@NormaCohen3 That's possible, though DC admin costs (at least in the US) have been coming down pretty quickly on their own. I think they've dropped by half relative to assets in the past decade, though that's partly because assets have risen.
@OliviaJGonzalez I just don't know how blockchain would do that. The misvaluation of public pension liabilities today isn't because pension trustees *can't* find out the correct value; it's because they don't want to!
@ThurstonPowers The political economy issues -- favoring today's voters and today's politicians over future ones -- dominate the financial issues.
@PRKDMc @Terpin8or @cate_long @trschatz51 It would be better than nothing, but take a long time to phase in.
@RetireRevised The irony!
I have a very hard time understanding how block chain is supposed to fix the pensions crisis. Public pensions' problem isn't administrative costs, but promising benefits without funding them.	https://t.co/mnn8FJzZhz
@RafiArrillaga Mission creep.
@cate_long @Terpin8or @WorldBank Data is only retrospective; that's presumably from the planning board. Future GNP is projected, based on a variety of assumptions. That's how any projection (say, CBO for the federal budget) works.
@cate_long @Terpin8or @WorldBank Not sure what you mean.
@RafiArrillaga I'll have to take a look. Thx.
@cate_long @Terpin8or @WorldBank One is real and the other nominal and one is GDP and the other GNP. But there's also going to be differences in population growth, productivity growth, etc.
@berman_allen @cate_long I like the employment/population ratio more; I think that's ticking up in PR as well.
@cate_long @Terpin8or You're misunderstanding: there's a baseline level of economic growth (which obviously may be right or wrong, given the uncertainty of these things) and then reforms like repealing law 80 are assumed to add to growth.
@cate_long Come on, Cate. Puerto Rico's unemployment rate could go to zero and it would still be far poorer than any mainland state because the labor force participation rate is so low.

@Kiffmeister @henryhtapper @Forbes @USCBO The core point is that the cost/value of a guaranteed future payment isn't the same at all times. It actually is more expensive to provide that payment when interest rates are low, similar to how it's more expensive to buy a house when interest rates are high.
@Kiffmeister @henryhtapper @Forbes @USCBO When the CBO updated its analysis in 2017, it also updated the discount rate it used to match the then-current Treasury yield. 	https://t.co/jF8kQ820A0	So conceptually, I think both Munnell &amp; the main US budget scorekeeper accept the same methodology I do.
@Kiffmeister @henryhtapper @Forbes At that time, some Democratic members of Congress objected; they asked the @uscbo to do it's own analysis of federal pay. For pensions, they used...the normal cost of the plan calculated using a Treasury yield, net of the employee contribution. https://t.co/iaZUsZ00Az
@Kiffmeister @henryhtapper In a 2011 paper on federal employee compensation, I defined "pension compensation" as the normal cost of the plan calculated using a risk-appropriate discount rate, minus the employee contribution as a percent of wages. I stuck with that definition in the @forbes piece.
@Kiffmeister @henryhtapper Alicia Munnell understands this point, and that to capture the full value of the benefit promise you need to capture both. https://t.co/PSWoZyamoY
@Kiffmeister @henryhtapper Thanks, @kiffmeister. A couple of thoughts. When a pension plan offers a benefit with a normal cost of x% of pay while calculated with a discount rate of y%, it's doing two things: first, contribution x upfront, but then guaranteeing a y% annual return on x in subsequent years.

@MikeOtsuka That's a good question. US Social Security is paygo, but its accounting is still market interest-rate based. That said, up to the early 1980s Social Security used a discount rate based on the rate of wage growth. So from a system financing viewpoint it's more ambiguous.
@JanetheActuary You're right on that. But my data are national and only go back to 2001; I think the lion's share of benefit enhancements took place prior to then.
A guaranteed pension benefit is more valuable, and more expensive, when interest rates are low. That explains how newly-accruing public pension benefits have more than doubled in generosity since 2001. 	https://t.co/Vu63GOqGNZ https://t.co/8Do0vx6dkI

@investing_in_ed @meepbobeep Sure. But, assuming a 4% discount rate, as private pensions would, the total normal cost for FRS special risk employees is something like 60% of wages. Would I pay 12% to get my employer to kick in 48%? Heck, yeah. That's crazy generous, even without Social Security.

@Frugal_Saver @JoshGotbaum @Forbes 3. Drawdowns of retirement accounts are set to the expected lifespan plus 5 years. By itself I think this would result in about 1/3rd of DC accounts running out. Real world I think people draw down more slowly. Maybe use a 1/life expectancy rule to adjust on the fly.
@Frugal_Saver @JoshGotbaum @Forbes 2. Over retirement, health spending grows with health CPI and non-health spending with non-health CPI. In the real world, real expenditures even for well-off households tend to decline by about 25% in real terms from 65 to 85, so I'd model this more closely.
@Frugal_Saver @JoshGotbaum @Forbes 1. The EBRI model sets a retiree's spending based upon broad income classes, say, $20-$40k, $40k+. I'd prefer something more precise, so that a person with a $20k retirement income isn't assumed to spend as much as someone with a $40k income.
@Frugal_Saver @JoshGotbaum @Forbes I think Josh is thinking about EBRI's model, which projects that many households will effectively run out of money in retirement. However, I can think of a few reasons EBRI's projections maybe biased upward. I'll run through them here.

@MikeOtsuka @IlliniBizDean @JohnRalfe1 @Kiffmeister @Dennis_Leech @Sam_Marsh101 @OpenUPP2018 @e_bartholomew It's not like a corporate bond isn't secured by assets; if the firm defaults, it's sold off and the proceeds used to pay off bondholders.

@JoshGotbaum @tarasbernard @annetergesen @aimeepicchi @jeffspross @yuvalrosenberg @ailsachang @ASoergel One possibility for the age-group relative increase post-2001 is the 2005 bankruptcy bill, which tightened eligibility in ways that affected the young more than retirees.

@investing_in_ed Almost everything - Social Security benefits, pensions, etc. - is projected to rise faster than the poverty threshold. So they're not my predictions, but SSA's and Urban's.
@LaurieJRowley @investing_in_ed SSA projects that poverty in old age will fall from about 7% today to 5.7%. See https://t.co/7xKOKi0j4c		Teresa's increase in poverty is purely due to rising population; the rate will fall, but we'll have more retirees. It's a real stretch to call that a problem.
@investing_in_ed Teresa generates higher poverty by defining it differently. Both SSA &amp; the Urban Institute, who have (by far) the most sophisticated retirement models project lower retiree poverty in the future.
@hiltzikm @glesgabrighton Did Social Security benefits rise by 52% over that period? No. Moreoever, the Fed's dataset understates retiree incomes by about 15%, so clearly they're missing something.
@hiltzikm @glesgabrighton Um, the two are consistent. Social Security makes up about 40% of total retirement incomes; the biggest single part, but not the only part - nor a number that can't change.
@BudgetBen But what is free health care compared to the power of this battle station?
@hiltzikm @glesgabrighton Do you actually think that quote supports your statement, or are you just trolling?
@hiltzikm @glesgabrighton I think that's more according to your spin.
@hiltzikm @glesgabrighton The top 5% have lower ratios of Social Security/pensions to earnings, but I assume that's because they're both over the payroll tax ceiling and the 401(k) contribution limit. 		https://t.co/XJZpcojmuj https://t.co/fs22dNK8y5
@glesgabrighton @hiltzikm The Fed has a study looking at total retirement savings (including accrued Social Security benefits) as a percentage of annual earnings. Those ratios are pretty similar for rich and poor, even if components differ.

@coachbuckethead How much pressure has their been to repeal the age 65 to 67 increase in the retirement age passed back in 1983? Basically zero. And, unlike the 1983 change, this is an increase in the retirement age that people would have agreed to. I don't see it.

@AustnNchols You're right. IMO, based on Puerto Rico &amp; Detroit, it shifts the incidence of debt cuts should sponsor go bankrupt. In bankruptcy, reality is that pensions are more secure than debt, so a pension obligation bond likely means bigger cuts for creditors, less for retirees.

@JoshGotbaum @EBRI This strikes me as credible evidence that is worth thinking about in establishing plans that would result in low-wage workers saving more, but at the reduction of their current take-home pay.
@JoshGotbaum @EBRI Bigger picture, poverty rates are lower in old age than while working. Likewise, Brady et al and Bee &amp; Mitchell find that the typical low-income retiree has a replacement rate of about 100% of pre-retirement earnings. Neither points to low-wage workers needing to save more.

Bigger picture, the longer-term the statistics are depressing: since the Americans with Disabilities Act was passed (1990) the percentage of people with self-reported disabilities who are working has plummeted. Eg, for men aged 35-45 the employment rate went from 42% to 26%.
@cate_long @giangonz @JBalmaceda787 I'm fine on pension beneficiary databases, but that's not going to solve this problem.
@Noahpinion &amp; @ernietedeschi are talking about different things. Stating you have a work-limiting disability in the CPS is different from claiming Social Security disability. Employment among the CPS disabled group fluctuates, whereas very few people on SSDI ever because of work. https://t.co/5pSMULcKiD
@e_bartholomew @MikeOtsuka @Sam_Marsh101 @achaplin71 @Kiffmeister @JohnRalfe1 @IlliniBizDean @henryhtapper @FirstActuarial @RedActuary @Derek_Benstead This is part of the problem: We act as if we know the average future return &amp; base long amortization periods on it. But if your assumption is too high -  likely for US public plans - the long amortization period digs an even deeper hole for future participants/funders.
@dlnewville I'd like to see more research, since this stuff is complicated and can affect people both while working &amp; in retirement. In some cases states can adjust means-tests themselves, but in others it might require changing federal law.
@MikeOtsuka @e_bartholomew @Sam_Marsh101 @achaplin71 @Kiffmeister @JohnRalfe1 @IlliniBizDean @henryhtapper @FirstActuarial I know I'm late to this game. But in this paper I modeled funding for US state/local plans. The takeaway: a plan won't go insolvent if sponsors ALWAYS make full contributions. But those can be at times be VERY high, such that sponsors may not make them.  	https://t.co/hTamlQXMHi
@dlnewville We definitely need more research. I'd like to see states set up independent studies from the get-go, as Seattle did when it raised it's minimum wage. Appoint respected experts &amp; get them access to the data they'd need.
@dlnewville Hopefully there's an easy fix; I'm not so sure. But isn't it troubling that none of the states seem to have given it much thought?
@dlnewville My assumption wasn't no changes to Social Security at all, but that full benefits would be retained for low-income workers. Knowing the various reform proposals pretty well, that's an assumption I'm comfortable with.
@mfcannon Think of it this way: in 2033 the fed govt will transfer maybe $250 billion to Social Security to repay the trust fund. In 2034 the fund is gone, but the govt can still transfer those general revenues. The incremental cost year to year isn't very high.
@EyeOnPuertoRico Your prayers have been answered. Or at least the first half.
@mfcannon 2/ I don't see any serious cuts to low-end retirees ever, and even any cuts for middle/high-incime retirees likely to be ogased in. Social Security is a real problem, but more for the budget/taxpayers than for retirees.
@mfcannon Legally, benefits get cut by 1/4 when the trust fund runs out in 2034. But that's not going to happen. Either the federal government will simply keep transferring general revenues to Social Security, as it is now to repay the TF, or it will raise taxes. 1/
@mfcannon In theory, yes. But auto-IRAs have been sold as a way to make low earners better off. The political system won't support accounts that in practice could make them worse off, both pre- and lost-retirement. But policymakers so far have ignored the issue of means-tested benefits.
@CitizenVMachine @JanetheActuary @PensionTsunami Sure, there are pros and cons.
@CitizenVMachine @JanetheActuary @PensionTsunami I think the employee contribution usually is lower for Social Security covered positions.
@CitizenVMachine @JanetheActuary @PensionTsunami A lower multiplier means they'd need to work more years to get the same teacher pension benefit. But that effect is reduced (maybe eliminated, depending on the system) by the fact that they're also getting Social Security benefits.
@JanetheActuary @PensionTsunami 2/ Vesting/portability are worse with state/local plans, but as I showed in this @RANDCorporation study, the disparate treatment of teachers of different career lengths isn't as bad as is often thought. https://t.co/qL88CbSjEb
@JanetheActuary @PensionTsunami On paper, state/local pensions are a massively better deal than Social Security. SS's implicit rate of return is the growth of aggregate wages (4.5% over next 30 years) while for a S/L plan it's the assumed investment return, ~7.5%. Over a full career that's a big difference. 1/

@RetireRevised That means the principal beneficiary of the account isn't the low-income worker who funded it, but the state/federal budgets. That's not at all how auto-IRAs are sold &amp; I really doubt that's politically sustainable. So let's think about how these plans should work.
"I love you robot." 😀 https://t.co/BDlq1lJPeO
@JohnCScott_DC @MSFalk I get it. But I suspect that unless means-test policies are changed in a pretty significant way, state/federal budgets would benefit more from auto-IRAs than the participating workers would. I'd like to dig into this deeper, but it will demand some modeling work.
@RetireRevised @MichaelRStrain Medicaid has an income rather than asset test, so auto-IRAs will mostly disqualify people when they withdraw their accounts at retirement. I don't really have a strong view on Medicaid work requirement, but those hit a different population than the auto-IRAs woudl affect.
@RetireRevised My first point was that "AEI" doesn't support or oppose Medicaid work requirements or any other policy. AEI analysts have views on policies &amp; sometimes those views differ (e.g., see my debate with @MichaelRStrain on paid parental leave).
@RetireRevised Leaving aside that I didn't write the headline, I'm not sure what the question is.
@MSFalk One move would be to exclude retirement savings from asset/income tests. But then you'll make eligible a bunch of people who weren't previously eligible and who may not need the benefits. So it's not *that* easy, plus the issue isn't even on the radar screen.
@unclejohn1000 @dcjretiresecure I discussed rising labor force participation in this @WSJ piece from 2012. The short story is that more retirees/near-retirees have been working, and that wages have been pretty good (i.e., not the so-called Wal-Mart greeters).	https://t.co/797swlv396
@JanetheActuary You're right. Setting an income threshold would reduce (possibly in significant way) the number of new auto-IRA enrollees, but if they don't need to save at that income level that's not a problem.
@unclejohn1000 @dcjretiresecure Most people have some discretion as to when they retire; obviously some don't, based on health, unemployment, etc. But if you do have the choice, this kind of information is useful.

@JerryBuchko @SquaredAwayBC @Vanguard_Group @USDOL I totally agree on looking at subsets; you want to know whether the people who need to be saving - meaning, non-young and non-poor - are doing so. I think the evidence indicates they mostly are, though whether they're saving *enough* is harder to say.
RT @RetirementRsrch: "Work v. Save Options Quantified" new! @SquaredAwayBC: https://t.co/CiF1sQAqGk #RetirementSecurity #SavingRate	 	@nber…
5/ I suggest not auto-enrolling workers until their pay passes some threshold. The UK's plan doesn't auto-enroll workers with salaries less than $13k. In addition, we should reform Social Security to add a much stronger base benefit for poor retirees.
4/ Many govt transfer programs have asset/income tests that could easily be triggered by even modest savings. SegalCo projected that in first 5 years alone, 47,000 retiree households would lose Medicaid coverage. That's a gain for state budgets, but a loss for the poor.
3/ Auto-IRAs will raise retirement saving. But recent evidence suggests that, for lower-income workers, consumer, auto &amp; mortgage debt could rise by a much greater amount. As a result, net worths may not increase and households may not be better off in retirement.
2/ To start, there's not much evidence that lower-income workers *should* be saving more for retirement. Social Security replacement rates are high, poverty in old age is lower than during working years, and most low-income retirees have incomes matching their pre-retirement pay.
For those who can't access, a quick summary. States are setting up auto-enrollment retirement plans for employees who aren't offered a plan at work. These can do a lot of good, but there are also some significant downsides -- especially for lower-income workers. 1/
@JerryBuchko @SquaredAwayBC @Vanguard_Group @USDOL I think Vanguard's is just for its own clients. They've got individual-level data, which is really useful and I like their report.

@CaraballoCueto I agree with a lot of this, but you've posed the question incorrectly. I don't think that labor laws or the welfare state caused the crisis; I think the withdrawal of 936 did. But why is the economy so weak that w/o 936 it can't survive? That's where the other factors matter.
@HCorderoGuzman It's based on ACS data using BEA's regional price parities. The latter don't cover Puerto Rico, though you could fudge it by using World Bank PPP's (although that's for the whole island, not cities/regions).

@cate_long Cate, you hit the Board for being too soft on the government regarding the budget, but then when the Board passes a budget that reduces costs that's adversarial? #cantwin
@cate_long Apply it now but then scale in funding changes. But there's no point in having faulty information because it skews other policies, such as how much investment risk to take or whether a benefit increase is affordable.
@cate_long Ok. But the key issue is that most pensions (either US private or overseas public/private) don't use the expected return on assets, and economists almost universally think it's the wrong approach. Creditors should favor honest accounting, since it prompts better pension funding.
@cate_long 1. A risk-appropriate discount rate calculates the cost of what the plan is promising, which is a guaranteed benefit. That's relevant even if benefits can be cut. 2. In practice, benefits aren't cut very much, even in bankruptcy.
@RominaBoccia Or sometimes they're just all jealous! 😀
@cate_long If you're promising a riskless benefit, then a riskless discount rate is the right benchmark since it captures the obligation to pay benefits even if pension fund returns fall short. Unfunded pension liabilities will fall a bit as Treasury yields rise, but still very high.

@hiltzikm @Forbes @WSJ @AEIecon Retirement incomes have risen faster than wages over the past several decades. So some who couldn't live comfortably while working can do so in retirement. Will it continue? Harder to say.
@Frugal_Saver @joshrauh Maybe - not sure. But I don't think it' a huge dollar cost.
@CaraballoCueto 2/ I think the mainstream view is that excessive labor market rigidity &amp; high implicit tax rates for people receiving welfare benefits hurt more than they help. Labor market reform isn't a miracle cure, but without it I don't see Puerto Rico truly becoming prosperous long-term.
@CaraballoCueto This raises an important point about how I (at least) see my role on the Board. In areas where I know a lot (pensions) I push my own views. Where I know less, I look for mainstream views - say, where the IMF, US CBO or most academics come out. 1/

@joshrauh 2/ Let's say Congress raises the payroll tax rate a couple of points &amp; lifts the cap to cover 90% of total earnings. That's going to be less progressive than just using income taxes. And given Social Security's history/structure, I don't think it's an unlikely scenario.
@joshrauh It's possible the opposite could happen. By 2033, about 20% of Social Security is effectively funded from income taxes, which are used to repay the trust fund. About 60% of income taxes are paid by the top 5% of individuals. In 2034 that obligation stops. 1/

@RafiArrillaga Say that baseline annual GDP growth is x% &amp; labor reform adds y%. Both residents &amp; creditors benefit. since that extra y% raises incomes and tax revenues. If no reform, and so no y% extra growth, there's less $ for all. But why does the Board have to prove precisely what y% is?
@cate_long @USGAO Ok. But I'm still not sure how it serves your purposes to argue that, whatever reforms the Board can implement, future GDP will be smaller. But I think we've hashed this one out.
@paquitocaserio @cate_long I understand your point. But it was partly practical, because two-tier regulation is harder and disadvantages existing firms. And partly to move more quickly to a more flexible &amp; dynamic labor market.
@cate_long @USGAO The growth assumption is a judgement call made from variety of studies. But ok, if you think the growth effect from labor reform is smaller, that means there's going to be less money to go around. I'm not sure how that serves your argument for more debt service.
@cate_long Do you think it should be higher or lower? Ours is a little high by mainland standards, but Puerto Rico is different (e.g., out-migration). I've spoken to Andy Wolfe about ours &amp; came out feeling it was reasonable under the circumstances.
@cate_long If you think labor reforms won't boost growth, it's easy to figure out how much GDP grows &amp; how much money there is for debt service. Answer: not as much as you'd like. Long-term, both creditors &amp; residents of Puerto Rico NEED economic growth; their true interests are aligned.
@cate_long @USGAO I'm not sure this is a good argument from your perspective. It's not that the Board projects a baseline GDP growth rate MINUS some amount if labor reforms aren't passed. There's a baseline that can grow if reforms are enacted. Growth means higher incomes &amp; more $ for creditors.
@cate_long Maybe, but that has nothing to do with the labor reforms.
@cate_long Why would the legislature sue the Board over a policy that's not going to be implemented? Maybe the Board could sue the legislature or otherwise employ PROMESA, but that's not likely.
@cate_long If they don't pass the legislation there's nothing to sue us over.
@cate_long Not exactly how it worked; the legislature refused to pass labor reforms as agreed with the governor for the prior fiscal plan. As a result, the Board had to revise the prior fiscal plan to reflect lower expected economic growth and revenues. I doubt the legislature shifts.

@Ed_Realist Public safety do have bigger spiking &amp; disability fraud problems. Politically very hard to touch. But teacher pensions in many states are still very sweet.
@Ed_Realist Employee pension contributions are up a little &amp; some new hires get lower benefits, but most 1990s benefit hikes stand for quite some time. The pension generosity gap w/private sector is still really big.
@Ed_Realist I embrace the title. My gut: many state lawmakers know more needs done on pensions, but in a blue state the primary is where the danger is. And unions have more power in primaries than the general.
@Ed_Realist What it could mean is state legislatures less public employee-friendly on things like pensions, as unions may have less power in primaries. But big-picture, you're right.
@EjmEj Does Janus affect private sector unions at all?
@Heminator You're right, but there's still a free-rider problem: most public employees receive union-negotiated benefits even if they're not members, so clearly there's an incentive to avoid paying dues. Sure, some govt employees do disagree w/unions' politics, but that's not all it is.

@JanetheActuary @RichardvReeves Use square root of family size or a Citro-Michaels adjustment to account for kids.
@yardsbkc I don't really think in those terms. Unionization works in some cases and for some people, less for others.
Public-sector unions usually insist their members are UNDERpaid. If employees take this seriously it's not surprising they'd stop paying their dues if not required to do so. Now that unions will need to sell themselves more to members, I wonder if they'll take more credit.
I've got sympathy for public-sector unions; it's tough to say they haven't produced for their members. In a 2015 study of state govt employees I found a 15% average total compensation premium over the private sector, with some states paying much more.	https://t.co/PyJ6MglzjU

@hiltzikm No time to debate - I've got cat videos to watch - but if Social Security increases the deficit (and it does) then part of that higher interest cost will be due to Social Security. How much? I don't know. But the today/tomorrow/etc. statement doesn't necessarily hold.
@hiltzikm Short-term, maybe. But in a textbook long-term growth model more spending lowers growth, because it means lower saving.
@hiltzikm Hey, I'm on a plane, so don't nitpick. I just took CBO's estimate of the average shortfall over 75 years (1.5%) and @BudgetHawks's estimate of the annual cost of the tax cuts (0.9%). Maybe I'm off a bit.

@Wagner2626 @USCBO Forever? I guess that'd do it...

The press can do better -- all these data are available and there's research to back it. And the press *should* do better.
Likewise, while workers' average wages have risen by 42% over inflation from 1998-2016 (SSA data), IRS data show that average incomes from pensions, annuities and retirement accounts rose by 55%. SCF data show the same thing: retirement incomes rising FASTER than wages.

@SaulNazario @USCBO Sure, but the idea behind Social Security was that, beyond a certain point, you did it all on your own.
@SaulNazario @USCBO There's a reason that neither Franklin D Roosevelt nor the vast majority of other developed countries went that route. It's to maintain political support by distinguishing Social Security from "welfare." Maybe that doesn't matter; maybe it does.
4/ Finally, all of this comes before any loss to revenues due to behavioral changes by the employees themselves due to higher tax rates. Make your own assumptions on this end. Short story: raising the Social Security tax cap will net a lot less new revenue than it will gross.
3/ In addition, states would lose the income taxes they otherwise would collect on those earnings. For states like California, Connecticut or New York, that's potentially a big deal.
2/ If employers reduce employees' wages to cover their own higher payroll tax liabilities, the federal government will lose the Medicare &amp; income taxes levied on these wages. According to Joint Tax Committee, this would cost 15-21% of gross revenues. https://t.co/OfQfxAZAT4

@RafiArrillaga @Terpin8or This was the point of the comparison: there's plenty of demand for tourism and Puerto Rico has a HUGE natural advantage over Nebraska, yet PR has fewer tourism-related jobs despite have 1/3rd higher population. A whole range of factors are holding back job growth.
@RafiArrillaga Still not 100% following you. But PR has incentives to build hotels, but then disincentives to hire staff. So you get nicely built, but understaffed, hotels. Were I designing things (which I'm not) I'd shift incentives toward hiring staff, since Puerto Rico needs jobs.

@AlexNowrasteh @mccanned Most working on Social Security disagree. Regardless, the point-in-time way you analyze Social Security can be misleading in terms of the policy inferences one might draw. Maybe not; but if your approach is correct, using a more robust analysis shouldn't change the conclusions.
@AlexNowrasteh @mccanned For Social Security it will be misleading because it ignores both taxes paid &amp; that benefits can go from zero to $15k per year just by a person hitting retirement age. For the other true welfare programs a snapshot of benefit receipt may be fine; I'd just stick with them.
@AlexNowrasteh It's not considered welfare because it has a dedicated tax, upon which your benefits are (progressively) based. It's not needs-based &amp; not means-tested. Mike Tanner's welfare vs work studies never included Social Security; I think it's because it's a contributory system.
@AlexNowrasteh @mccanned But again, how is Social Security 'welfare'? The standard measures of Social Security progressivity (used by Cato &amp; everyone else) compares taxes/benefits over a lifetime. And legal immigrants are treated better on those measures (undocumented do worse).
@mccanned @AlexNowrasteh Social Security is the least progressive entitlement program when taxes/benefits are tallied &amp; even it favors legal immigrants. Medicare more, Medicaid even more. Immigration isn't merely a budget issue, but simply counting Social Security benefits at a single time isn't correct.
@AlexNowrasteh A few Social Security questions. Why is it counted as welfare? Most don't call it that. Can you control for age? If immigrants are younger, they're less likely to be retired. Can you distinguish documented from un? Social Security treatment is very different between the two.

@MarcGoldwein @EBRI This SSA paper found that due to response error, "the participation rate in DC plans is about 11 percentage-points higher when using W-2 tax records rather than survey reports." https://t.co/zfxpg8zseM
@MarcGoldwein @EBRI Even the baseline rate of ~50% is probably too low due to response error in the survey. Some people falsely say they have a retirement plan when they don't, but a larger number say they don't when they do.
@MarcGoldwein Almost certainly. The recent decline was because Census changed the survey. Says @ebri "Unless modifications are made to the CPS, using the CPS for estimating the participation in pension and other retirement plans will provide misleading and inaccurate estimates &amp; conclusions."

@JoshZumbrun @AllisonSchrager @M_C_Klein @Biggs There can also be (and likely will be!) selective default by income level; I'm guessing Social Security benefits for low-earners are paid almost in full, whereas benefits for high earners are more risky.

@beveridge922 @DanaPerino Except (by design) your taxes were used to pay retirees' benefits. To invest your taxes, either those retirees would have to receive benefit cuts or you (or govt) would need to come up with extra money. That's a big reason President Bush's personal accounts plan didn't pass.
@RetireRevised @ReutersMoney @NCPSSM They're incorrect. But most news stories (at least that I've seen) reference a cut in benefits when the trust fund runs dry, not the elimination of them.
@JoshZumbrun @AllisonSchrager @M_C_Klein @Biggs Total accrued Social Security benefits are somewhere north of $30 trillion, with a progressive skew, so it's a big deal.
@mine65613426 @DanaPerino Leaving aside whether illegal immigrants receive those other benefits, they're simply not funded from your Social Security taxes. Your Social Security taxes pay for Social Security retirement, survivors &amp; disability benefits, not food stamps, etc. Really, it's true.
@AllisonSchrager @JoshZumbrun @M_C_Klein My point is that you'd expect to see highly skewed (retirement) wealth if low-income households were required to invest 12% of earnings in a progressive but off-the-books retirement plan. For retirement, at least, low-earners shouldn't be saving a ton outside of Social Security.
@AllisonSchrager @JoshZumbrun @M_C_Klein @Biggs This Fed paper uses SCF retirement assets with imputed DB pension and Social Security wealth; it's obviously a very different distributional picture when the PV of future Social Security is included. https://t.co/XJZpcoAXST https://t.co/9rJ1AKx8cA
@mine65613426 @DanaPerino To claim Social Security benefits you need a valid Social Security number and must have paid taxes over your lifetime. Many illegal immigrants do pay Social Security taxes, but then can't collect benefits.
@PAPensFan Such as??
@AllisonSchrager Every Trustees Report is greeted with statements that a 25% cut to Social Security benefits in 2034 wouldn't be such a big deal, coming from people who simultaneously oppose any cuts to any beneficiaries at any time.
@ReutersMoney @NCPSSM @RetireRevised I get that people may misunderstand what solvency means, thinking it implies zero benefits. But people - including the SS Trustees - who say Social Security is insolvent aren't being incorrect or dishonest.
@ReutersMoney @NCPSSM @RetireRevised @RetireRevised writes: "In other words, [in 2034] retirees - and future retirees - would lose nearly a quarter of their benefits. But that is not insolvency..." 		But, as defined by the Social Security trustees &amp; actuaries, that IS insolvency - the inability to pay full benefits.

@YFeyman @Prof_Richardson Exactly; it was @ssworks trying to shut down debate on affordability; we should have that debate along with a debate on values.
@YFeyman @Prof_Richardson Of course values matter. But the Social Security expansion favored by @ssworks would have meaningful effects on funds available for other programs, as well as on incentives to work, save, and delay retirement. Saying it's only "values" wishes away analysis of those effects.
@IlliniBizDean @PaulNVandeWater And yet, is exaggeration the only way to get Congress to act? Acknowledge that Social Security isn't currently a crisis and Congress's response is, 'Great, let's just wait until it is...'.
@IlliniBizDean @tbarson49 @joshrauh And yet, for whatever problems there are on the private DB side, private plans have put aside roughly twice as much per dollar of future promised benefits as have state/local plans.
In honor of yesterday's Trustees Report, a chart on how Social Security  "replacement rates" (benefits/pre-retirement earnings) have changed over time.

@hiltzikm It's perfectly fine to argue that. But to claim, as they did, that there are no costs of consequence to expanding Social Security is dopey and misleading.

@SaulNazario On average, all-in teacher compensation isn't low; it's low in some place for some teachers. But that also means in other places and for other teachers it's higher!
@MarcGoldwein @ernietedeschi In the past that would have bothered me, but today I think the perception of self-funding is an impediment to reform.
@rohitguptahpf @ernietedeschi 2/ It's likely that new tax will be LESS progressive than the income taxes currently being used; say, even raising the Social Security payroll tax ceiling is probably less progressive than income taxes. So the distributional outcome of delaying reform could end up regressive.
@rohitguptahpf @ernietedeschi Here's the twist: Right now, Social Security benefits are paid thru payroll taxes (regressive) and income tax revenues transferred to repay the trust fund (progressive). Once the trust fund runs out, either those general revenue transfers continue or some new tax is applied. 1/
@ernietedeschi It's a delaying tactic: put off any reform until the trust fund is about to go insolvent, at which time resolving the gap thru large benefit cuts is politically impossible. Instead, raise taxes. That's basically how the disability fund's exhaustion was resolved in 2016.
@Terpin8or A quibble!

This is why you can't look only at teacher salaries; benefits are a much, much bigger part of the teacher compensation picture today than in the past. Main benefits include pensions, health insurance and retiree health coverage. https://t.co/cEnDCdITHr
@kathleenromig All those beautiful tables...
Since 1970, schools have hired 3 million new employees, but only 1/3rd of those are teachers. Most are administrators &amp; various support staff. US schools have twice the level of non-teaching staff as the average OECD country. Leaner administration leaves more money for salaries.
In 1975, teachers earned fringe benefits equal to 19% of their salaries; private sector workers, 14%. Today, private sector benefits have risen to 19% of salaries; teacher benefits are worth 47% of salaries. Total teacher compensation has *risen* relative to the private sector.
While it's commonly believed that teacher salaries are falling behind those of other college grads, since 2000 teacher and private sector salaries have risen at almost the same rate.
In polls, 70% of Americans support teacher pay raises. But when asked what teachers are currently paid, Americans guess $39k; the true average teacher salary is $58k, almost 50% higher. When told of actual average teacher salary, support for pay increase drops to only 42%.

@AdamBeeEcon Could be. Realistically, the combination of a high discount rate + an additional haircut means they're taking a much bigger loss than pensioners in any bankruptcy to date. But fear combined with financial literacy could make it seems worthwhile.

@CaraballoCueto @HCorderoGuzman @ARBMV @EstadisticasPR You're right on the outsiders. But the reduced protections are pretty small and the only way to prevent them from becoming insiders is to keep them part-time.		Labor reforms alone won't fix the economy; but without a less rigid labor market the island will always be poor. 1/
@HCorderoGuzman @marcorubio has several policy ideas to do that, including (among other things) a federally funded EITC-like benefit and a cut to the employee payroll tax rate. Both would help. But commonwealth-level labor reform is also greatly needed.
@HCorderoGuzman Look in the Gov's prior fiscal plan, which didn't have labor reforms. The fastest period of projected growth is the next five years when federal money is coming in. After that growth is practically zero. So if you need to pass reforms, and Puerto Rico does, now is the time.
@HCorderoGuzman I wish we could wait for PR to have a booming economy to implement labor reform. But without reforms, there won't be a booming economy. So the labor reforms are timed to coincide with other reforms to help the economy, and with billions in federal stimulus.
@HCorderoGuzman The fiscal plan includes an EITC to strengthen work incentives without (as with a higher minimum wage) hurting employers' incentive to hire workers.
@aacruzpr @HCorderoGuzman Despite the logical claim that bussiness don't like regulations, many businesses WANT regulation - like occupational licensing - because it shuts out competitors.
@HCorderoGuzman I understand and appreciate where you come down. I just think the weight of the research supports the notion that a less rigid labor market will create more opportunities.
@HCorderoGuzman I'm also not sure what the background logic of these charts is - that more people in Puerto Rico would work if wages were higher but they choose not to work at current wage rates?
@HCorderoGuzman It's not the Board's logic; it's the conclusion drawn by many, many studies which (unlike the two charts here) try to control for many different factors while isolating the effects of a given policy.
@aacruzpr @HCorderoGuzman The government has pledged to work on occupational licensing issues.
@HCorderoGuzman 2. Many of the rich states (say, CA or NY) were rich *before* they implemented these kinds of regulations. So yes, a rich state won't be crushed if it imposes labor laws that are much less onerous than Puerto Rico's. But PR isn't rich and it's labor laws go much, much further.
@HCorderoGuzman Two thoughts: 1. Even the California labor regulations are much, much less onerous than Puerto Rico's; the point of showing both FL and CA is that, while there are variations on the mainland, Puerto Rico labor law requires far more than even a state like California.

@Cuddlefudge @AEI Two ways of thinking about. One, @BLS_gov analyzes skill requirements for different occupations &amp; grades them on federal GS scale. Those skill grades are good predictors of salaries. And teacher pay is about where other jobs with similar skill requirements are. 1/

Employment protections may be good IF you have a job, but bad if you don't. It's an insiders vs outsiders thing. With nearly half of households in poverty, creating jobs is the top priority.
@ARBMV @CaraballoCueto @HCorderoGuzman @EstadisticasPR Total wages would increase, but hourly wages need not increase. Maybe they would, but the point is to get more people working at jobs.
@CaraballoCueto @HCorderoGuzman @ARBMV @EstadisticasPR Income equals the hourly wage x hours worked. Labor reform is intended to increase incomes by raising the number of hours worked by bringing more people into the labor force. You're focusing on the hourly wage, which isn't what labor reform is about. That's why I asked.
@CaraballoCueto @HCorderoGuzman @ARBMV @EstadisticasPR Again, this is similar to the hourly wage; pulling less-skilled or unemployed people into the workforce might even lower output per hour, even if it increased incomes and reduced poverty.
@CaraballoCueto @HCorderoGuzman @ARBMV @EstadisticasPR I'm honestly wondering why the focus on the hourly wage rate, when law 80 and other labor reforms are focused on the level of emoyment?
@CaraballoCueto @ARBMV @HCorderoGuzman @EstadisticasPR I like and respect Dean Baker. But it's one study that's not directly about the issue (labor force participation, vs the unemployment rate), while dozens of other studies represent the prevailing view.

@RafiArrillaga @ARBMV @CaraballoCueto @HCorderoGuzman @EstadisticasPR I don't know which you're referring to, but those studies didn't really support a min wage increase in Puerto Rico.
@CaraballoCueto @HCorderoGuzman @ARBMV @EstadisticasPR 3/ Still, your figures exclude the many developed countries - say, France - where average US hourly wages are substantially higher. 		All told, the Act 80 issue is about job opportunities, not average wages.
@CaraballoCueto @HCorderoGuzman @ARBMV @EstadisticasPR 2/ On the other hand, the inablity to dismiss poor performing employees might reduce productivity; this would reduce wages. There's evidence of this as well.
@CaraballoCueto @HCorderoGuzman @ARBMV @EstadisticasPR The effect of excessive employment protections on average wages is ambiguous. If they limit job opportunities for less-skilled individuals, that would push average wages up. 1/
@ARBMV @CaraballoCueto @HCorderoGuzman @EstadisticasPR 5/ It doesn't mean there's no PR-specific data. Say, Puerto Rico's employment and wage rates are such that you'd conclude that a relatively high minimum wage raises pay for less-skilled workers who are employed, but reduces the number who have jobs. But does it *prove* it? No.
@ARBMV @CaraballoCueto @HCorderoGuzman @EstadisticasPR 4/ I don't know if the govt ever released its study on raising the minimum wage in Puerto Rico, but it was exactly like that - looking at research on different states and countries, then trying to fit to Puerto Rico's case. This is often as close as you can get.
@ARBMV @CaraballoCueto @HCorderoGuzman @EstadisticasPR 3/ So you often look at a range studies from different places; a large number of studies gives you more confidence that the basic results are correct as well as providing individual cases that might be similar to Puerto Rico in different ways.  Again, that's very common.
@ARBMV @CaraballoCueto @HCorderoGuzman @EstadisticasPR 2/ There aren't many chances to do that within Puerto Rico, both because there haven't been huge changes in policy and because many other things (say, changes to 936, govt bankruptcy, hurricanes) happening at the same time. That's not at all uncommon in public policy.
@ARBMV @CaraballoCueto @HCorderoGuzman @EstadisticasPR Statistical/econometric research relies on *differences* -- differences between different entities, differences in the same entity over time, differences in how different groups are treated within the same entity, etc., all while trying to control for other factors. 1/
@CaraballoCueto @HCorderoGuzman @ARBMV @EstadisticasPR 2/ How many jobs would be created if the 2017 reform had taken Puerto Rico closer to mainland standards, had applied to more employees, and had more time to take effect?
@CaraballoCueto @HCorderoGuzman @ARBMV @EstadisticasPR I have no idea how the govt estimated how many jobs the 2017 reform created, given everything else going on at the time. But the 2017 reform closed maybe 10% of the gap between PR and the mainland and it applied only to new hires. And the 300 jobs you cite are in one year. 1/

@ArthurOtkeKeim A common trope from the pension industrial complex is to treat investment returns as a "contributor" separate from employee/employer contributions. In fact, today's investment returns are purely a function of past employer/employee contributions. It's a deceptive presentation.
@MSFalk Exactly. But NCPERS isn't known for its rigorous analysis.
Unbelievable, literally. https://t.co/02dZXagbek
@investing_in_ed @amontara11 The Federal Reserve literally has the ability to print money. Still, it uses around a 4.5% discount rate to fund it's pension plan. Underfunding shifts costs to future taxpayers, even if the plan can never go insolvant.
@investing_in_ed @amontara11 Here's the Academy of Actuaries on the 80% funding myth. https://t.co/wGU5YOyG7B
@investing_in_ed @amontara11 Definitely some are better than others. But measured using a reasonable discount rate, as corporate and federal pensions are, even the best state plans (say, Wisconsin) have funding gaps.
@hiltzikm 5/ If you check average people who look like him in the Brady @ICI /IRS study, they're getting Social Security replacement rates of 30-40% of final earnings and non-Social Security replacement rates even higher than that. So he's an unusual case, assuming his numbers are right.
@hiltzikm 4/ Obviously that doesn't help him, but points to why he has low SS benefits: he had years in jobs w/o SS coverage, so he didn't even fill out his full 35 years of earnings.
@hiltzikm 3/Looking at it more: he claims he'd get a 44% replacement rate as measured by SSA, but only 19% of final salary. He's probably measuring the SSA-style replacement wrong, comparing to average nominal earnings rather than avg wage-indexed earnings, which are 1/3rd higher.
@CaraballoCueto @HCorderoGuzman @ARBMV @EstadisticasPR ...if excessive employment protections reduce opportunities for less-skilled workers, you'd expect productivity to be higher in those countries because less-skilled workers are locked out.  In fact, output per hour could drop if jobless find jobs, even if total incomes/GDP rise.
@CaraballoCueto @HCorderoGuzman @ARBMV @EstadisticasPR While this is getting astray from Puerto Rico, I think the chart you link to shows the growth of hourly earnings from 2010-2016, not the level.

So alternatives &amp; active management may be expensive and may not pay higher returns. But they allow pensions to assume higher returns today, in a way that's opaque to the public, and thereby reduce required contributions.
2. With equity index funds, the plan would either need to go nearly all-stocks to meet its target return (an obviously desperate move) or lower its assumed return, which means much higher contributions at time when many plans can barely pay what they owe.
Why don't public pensions shift to passive investments? 1. Maybe some undue influence from politically-connected asset managers (see NY comptroller, CalPERS CEO). But also... https://t.co/6YvRqOppNa

@HCorderoGuzman @ARBMV @CaraballoCueto @EstadisticasPR Sure, demographics plays a role, as do other factors. But so does policy. I'm not saying that one single policy accounts for all the problems. But together policy accounts for a lot and so we should fix those policies.

@CaraballoCueto @HCorderoGuzman @EstadisticasPR Who argued that employment protections are the sole determinant of the labor force participation rate?

@jroyauco A good part of the "increase" is that the pension system has run out of money and is paygo; but the shift to DC plans generates BIG savings in the future, which allows for payment of debt. Similarly with labor reforms; w/ no economic growth, no debt payment.

@HigherEdActuary @dontdelay @Cunningham_UK @jbthewealthman I'd have to dig up the reference, but there's a similar declines in retiree spending in the UK.
@Kiffmeister While the reason isn't 100% clear, the best story (to me) is complementaries between health/vitality and the utility retirees derive from spending. As people get older, most just don't want to spend as much as they did as younger retirees.
@Kiffmeister Second, it doesn't seem to be fear of running out of money that drives lower spending in retirement. You see that among better-off US retirees; you also see it in other countries with more DB pensions and national health care, where the risk of running short is much smaller.
@Kiffmeister I actually disagree (politely!) with both parts of this. First, the "most retirement research." Well, the stuff you read about in the newspaper. But the more sophisticated academic studies tell a much more encouraging story. Eg,	https://t.co/hpMzpGwcAt	https://t.co/GXanA740R3

@MUDDLAW @cate_long @Sauronpr It's a different world.
@Brad_Setser I'd like buy-in, and maybe we're getting a little. But Puerto Rico doesn't have a large reform constituency; much less, I'd say, than a place like Illinois. Given how PROMESA is written, a smooth structural reform process wasn't in the cards.
@Sauronpr @cate_long Yes. The Board will be releasing a document soon with more background information, but there's a lot of research on how labor laws affect employment and examples of countries that have benefited by making their labor markets more flexible.
RT @billhoagland: The public trustee positions have remained vacant since August 2015, during the development of the last three sets of rep…
@Brad_Setser We'll have some more documentation out soon. But to be clear, the Board decides on policies but (as it should be) Board members themselves don't scratch their heads and produce the economic estimates.
@Brad_Setser Maybe, and it's not trivial if we get things wrong. But on the policy end, I mostly think in terms of the long term and trying to get the sign right. Puerto Rico can't thrive (or maybe survive) with a 40% LFPR so I think in terms of policies to boost that.
@Brad_Setser And leaving that aside, there's still the political economy issue: the PR govt won't pass these reforms after the Board is gone, and even if passed now but with delayed phase-in there's huge implementation risk. "Now or never" sounds trite, but it's pretty close to the truth.
@Brad_Setser Sure, but it's the reforms that are assumed to drive a lot of that. The Gov's plan, which didn't have all the labor reforms, had the near-term bump due to federal spending but very little long-term growth. So my question to them at the time was, if not now, when?
@PapiiBrauii @Brad_Setser I totally understand, and the Board has pushed hard and demanded measurables on improving PR's ease of doing business ratings from the World Bank. But the implementation side of that is with the Govt, which will resist too much hands-on control by the Board.
@Brad_Setser I'm crunching on something, but you might check the Gov's fiscal plan that didn't have the labor reforms. I remember raising this at the Board's last meeting in San Juan, I'd just need to pull up the numbers again.
@Brad_Setser These aren't intended as countercyclical reforms to offset austerity; they're long-term reforms. And near-term they're disruptive. But a) they're necessary, and b) the short period of extra federal dollars coming into the island is our best chance to lessen that disruption.
@RafiArrillaga @ajfernos @HCorderoGuzman I get it. But the next 5 years isn't just the best time available economically, it's the only time politically. These are much-needed reforms but the Puerto Rico political system won't do them on its own - there's always an election to get past.
@ajfernos @HCorderoGuzman I agree that the best time to do reforms is during an expansion. Both the Board &amp; the Govt's project that, due to the influx of federal money, the next 5 years will be the highest-growth for the next several decades. So acting now is consistent with the research you cite.

@ChrisTorresLugo @MinistroCiencia Only if employee productivity never changed after that, which doesn't seem likely.
@IrvingSwisher That's a function of declining US LFPR, modest improvements in France, and (importantly) restricting to ages 25-54. France has much lower youth employment &amp; earlier retirement ages. In the 15+ measure (where PR is at 40%), the US is 62% and France 55%.
@HCorderoGuzman If you're comparing the economics profession to the flat earth society, I'm not sure what we can produce that would convince you. 		But if I can pull myself away from Twitter you'll see plenty of research supporting those conclusions.
@MinistroCiencia Employers are reluctant to hire marginal employees - say, the currently unemployed or less skilled - if it's costly to dismiss those who don't work out. They'll focus on skill employees, machines/technology, temporary employees, etc.		The other factors you mention also matter.
@miguelrios A survey, plus maybe 20 academic studies reaching the same conclusions. More to be released.
@HCorderoGuzman Q2 was more straightforward: 		"Reducing employment protection would reduce the equilibrium unemployment rate in France."		Economists who agreed outnumbered those who disagreed by 30-to-1.
@ElderNomics @dcjretiresecure Ask yourself: who *shouldn't* be saving for retirement at any given time? Answer: the young (who will save as their incomes rise) &amp; the poor (who get a high replacement rate from Social Security). What percent of the population are they - a third or so?

@DeanBaker13 Nor are future Social Security benefits. That's why various models try to infer all of those to get a fuller picture.
@NormaCohen3 The problem: even assuming 7.5%, many govts can't make their pension contributions. At a reasonable discount rate the plans may not be viable.
@CaraballoCueto 2/ I favor all policies to get the Island's economy moving. Labor reforms? Exports? A better business environment? Better schools? Better federal policies? A more efficient, more honest government? All of them, because all combine to make life harder in Puerto Rico.
@CaraballoCueto I don't think people who study those states would be shocked; they're not exactly employer-friendly. Outside of those three states, labor force participation by Puerto Ricans is 20 percentage points higher. By itself, that implies 50% higher household incomes &amp; lower poverty. 1/

@hiltzikm 10/ So maybe retirement income inequality will increase, maybe it won’t. But I’ve never focused on income inequality so much as retirement income adequacy. That’s high today and likely will remain so in the future, even if inequality increases a bit. End of rant.
@hiltzikm 9/ Fed research finds that when Social Security is included, the ratio of total retirement assets to current income is similar for lower-income and higher-income working-age households. The rich are richer, but not dramatically better prepared to maintain pre-retirement spending. https://t.co/mt5jmrSOK3
@hiltzikm 8/ Neither does the DYNASIM model project a "retirement crisis" with large numbers of retirees significantly short of what they need. Projected retirement income replacement rates are similar to today's while poverty rates are lower.
@hiltzikm 7/ As you point out, Bee &amp; Mitchell aren't predicting the future. But SSA’s MINT &amp; Urban’s DYNASIM model try to do that. DYNASIM projects very little change to retiree income inequality from 2015-2065. Mean-to-median retiree income ratios are very similar over time.
@hiltzikm 6/ In the Survey of Consumer Finances, the ratio of mean to median retiree incomes basically hasn’t changed since 1989. The ratio of 90th/10th percentile incomes has increased only a little. Since DB plans peaked in 1975, you'd expect some trend but there really isn't one. https://t.co/sDgYTGBTCL
@hiltzikm 5/ Bee &amp; Mitchell’s earlier work showed a near-doubling of the percentage of households receiving private retirement benefits form 1984-2007. If the rich already had private plans, presumably most of that gain was in non-rich. With auto-enrollment, I think that trend continues.
@hiltzikm 4/ But other factors matter. Before 401ks, private retirement plan benefits went heavily to the rich. A 1980 SSA survey found that only 9% of new retirees in bottom half of the income distribution had any private pension benefit. It’s not hard to beat nothing with something. https://t.co/y2FTFQUoh4
@hiltzikm 3/ But if pre-retirement income inequality rises, post-retirement income inequality will also rise EVEN in a perfect retirement system. People want to smooth consumption over time, so post-retirement incomes should correspond to (more unequal) pre-retirement incomes.
@hiltzikm /2 I don’t really work on income inequality. Piketty &amp; Saez say it’s risen a lot. Auten &amp; Splinter say not so much. Burkauser, I think, says inequality rose but then flattened out. Here’s some discussion. https://t.co/X2o7hi1kzS

@BudgetBen If on-the-job training builds human capital, then subdizing them at a lower wage should enable them to earn higher wages. If employer has to pay the higher wage from the get-go, no guarantee he'll do so since he gets no upfront-benefit &amp; employee can take human capital elsewhere.
@BudgetBen The correct approach, IMO, both practically and morally, is to say that society values a person who bothers to work at no less than $Y per hour, and society is going make sure you receive $Y even if your skills only warrant you $X per hour.
@BudgetBen Sure. But we'd equivalently be saying that if you're an individual whose productivity doesn't exceed $X per hour - where $X is a high minimum wage, plus value of food stamps, etc. - then you can't have a job. Because we can't expect employers to hire you on those terms.
This idea has practical issues: if the govt expands food stamp eligibility, are employers on the hook for newly-eligible employees? But it's also philosophically incoherent: if society decides citizens deserve some minimum income, shouldn't society (aka, taxpayers) pay for it? https://t.co/r4teojpkr1

If pre-retirement earnings grew more unequal and everyone saved perfectly for retirement - meaning, they could maintain their prior lifestyle - then retirement income would become more unequal as well. https://t.co/1YLTtiMBtj

@aparnamath @AngelaRachidi I don't think they've taken a position; there's no legislation on this yet, though I know some offices have been looking at it.
@TheRealKatduty One appeal to me of the Social Security idea was watching the 2016 PA Senate race, in which the Dem candidate favored the FAMILY Act. Once the GOP candidate started pushing on the payroll tax issue, you could sense the Dem didn't feel as confident. It's not *just* Grover.
@TheRealKatduty If paid parental leave has the positive effect on earnings that studies of California show, women who claim it could retire at the same age and still receive slightly higher Social Security benefits.
@TheRealKatduty I'm confident things have improved even since 2007, but most easily-available data on retirement incomes are no good so you have to wait until researchers with access to admin data produce studies.
@TheRealKatduty I'm not sure this is reasoned, but it's hard to raise taxes because people don't like paying them. If it were easy, we'd have fixed Social Security by raising taxes 30 years ago. The idea I'm talking about just recognizes that tax increases are hard &amp; tries to work around it.
@Rickersam3 I can believe it, but I also think there's just systematic pessimism. Where I think of panic is claims by people like @nirs that up to 92% of Americans aren't saving enough for retirement. That stuff's crazy.

@RyanLEllis @MichaelRStrain Maybe. But we didn't bail out the Notch Babies. And even progressives aren't looking to roll back raising the Social Security retirement age to 67. And that was mandatory, while parental leave beneficiaries would *choose* to accept a higher retirement age.

@BrianVJarvis @SquaredAwayBC I think you're right. If you're poor, you may be saving optimally for retirement (ie, so you can maintain your pre-retirement standard of living) but life won't be easy either pre- or post-retirement. But that's an income problem, not a retirement system problem.
@gene_krauss Could be. But I've looked further back and found a similar dynamic, so I think it's a consistent pessimism. Maybe retirement isn't as expensive as people think; most costs drop, people spend less, etc. My point is simply not to panic.
@glesgabrighton 2/ But retirement plan income for US retirees is a lot higher than people think; plus, spending declines post-retirement even for well-off retirees, whereas most retirement savings calculators assume constant post-retirement spending. So probably a bit of both.
@glesgabrighton Partly I think you're assuming pre-retirees made calculations of their retirement income adequacy that proved to be pessimistic. In reality, I think most didn't do that and just worry - it's human nature. 1/
In 2002, 41% of working-age households thought they wouldn't be able to live comfortably in retirement. In 2018, when many of that 41% are *actually* retired, only 22% say they don't have enough to live comfortably. Other data also show undue pessimism.	https://t.co/JlYGk8Fom2 https://t.co/oA36uhmojd

@NIRSonline @thehill @Forbes 7/ @NIRSonline points out that nearly half of households don't have retirement accounts. This ignores the nearly one-fifth of employees who work for government &amp; usually have a defined benefit pension rather than a 401(k)-type plan.
@NIRSonline @thehill @Forbes 5/ @NIRSonline also assumes that deficits in all public &amp; private defined benefit pensions will be addressed by cutting benefits, when in reality only a tiny fraction will be. By itself this unrealistic assumption boosts the "retirement savings gap" by about 14%.
@NIRSonline @thehill @Forbes 5/ @NIRSonline doesn't accurately model Social Security benefits, assuming that everyone gets the same replacement rate. As I showed in this paper, that will make more working-age households appear to be undersaving. https://t.co/0DYx5TnfUT
@NIRSonline @thehill @Forbes 4/ @NIRSonline sets an arbitrary *pattern* for retirement saving, where you start saving at age 25 &amp; if you don't have so much by so-and-so age, you're undersaving. This can make people seem to be undersaving nearly all their lives even if they end up with the right amount.
@NIRSonline @thehill 3/ 1st, @NIRSonline sets a very high goal for adequate retirement saving, equal to 8x final salary. As I showed @forbes, this savings goal will produce absurdly high retirement income replacement rates for most workers.   https://t.co/LaiXr40Ja6
@NIRSonline @thehill 2/ But if retirement contributions &amp; savings are at record levels, replacement rates for retirees are very high, retirement incomes are rising &amp; poverty in old age falling, all of which are true, what could cause @NIRSonline to find that nearly everyone is undersaving?

@cate_long Those are included with pensions and are cut in the Board's fiscal plan. Technically the non-pension benefits get cut first, then pensions. I think the fiscal plan (or maybe a previous document) has details.
@cate_long It could be an accounting-driven thing, since "pension expense" is a term of art in actuarial reports -- say, a change in discount rate, etc. But I haven't read through it all yet.
@JBalmaceda787 @HCorderoGuzman @amontara11 @cate_long Could it have been 9% or 11%? Sure. We had a sub-group working through the budget determining where and how much expenditures could be restrained without sticking certain stakeholders with all of the sacrifice. 10% was the figure we came up with for pensions.
@ernietedeschi Isn't it that (in these scorecards) the Scandanavian countries are freer in other areas? So economic freedom is *consistent* with a big welfare state, but all else equal, moving the US to a Scandinavian welfare system would make the US less free.
@JohnCScott_DC IRS SOI data has been expanded a bit and might be useful; it's more accurate on whether people are participating, but provides less demographic detail. Retirement research really needs better-quality data.
@JohnCScott_DC Note that there's a lot of respondent error regarding DC participation in the SIPP. Net participation via W-2 forms seems to be about 10% higher than reported in the SIPP, but there are also SIPP respondents who say they have DC plans who actually don't.  https://t.co/zfxpg8zseM

I don't know if we've released very long term projections, but over (say) 20 years the freeze on new benefit accruals has a very large positive impact on the budget. At that point the benefit cuts themselves aren't the biggest player. 1/
@CoryKoedel I believe when an insurance company takes more investment risk, the actuarial/accounting rules require them to set aside more reserves. When a public pension plan takes more risk, it sets aside less money.
@amontara11 @JBalmaceda787 @cate_long Google it and you can probably find it.
@amontara11 @JBalmaceda787 @cate_long I've only seen data for San Juan which (if I remember right) was about 8% above th US average. The rest of the island is presumably cheaper, but I don't believe the data exist.
@RJPIII @zbodie @whealthcareplan @JJFichtner @AnnaRappaport I don't see any reason you couldn't do this. I'm wondering if any other countries allow it. But note that @JJFichtner's idea to use supplemental accounts to allow for delayed Social Security claiming more or less hits the same goal.
@JBalmaceda787 @cate_long That's the federal poverty line (roughly) and we didn't want to cut anyone whose benefit was at or below that level.
@Philtraffa_ @cate_long There aren't good cost of living data for the whole island. But the ratio of PR teacher wages to other college-educated employees is about the same as the mainland. That doesn't tell you if someone is over- or underpaid, but it doesn't seem anything really unusual is going on.
@cate_long There are other ways to do this (say, adjusting for the cost of hiring a college-educated worker in different areas). All tend to compress teacher salary differences between states. Say, Hawaii pays pretty high teacher salaries, but it's very expensive to live there.
@JBalmaceda787 @cate_long So the formula is designed so that pension benefits aren't cut more than is estimated, but could be cut less.
@JBalmaceda787 @cate_long The pension benefit cut is based on an estimated Social Security benefit. If a retiree's actual benefit is lower than the estimate, he can show it to the pension system and his cut will be reduced. If it's greater than estimated, he doesn't have to do that.
@JBalmaceda787 @cate_long The reason for looking at combined Social Security &amp; pension benefits is that it helps equalize treatment between regular employees who participate in Social Security and police, teachers and judges, who don't. Without that adjustment, the latter groups would suffer more.

@CHASE03670 Florida has done such a study while controlling for teacher ratings; those correlate with non-teaching pay. Studies showing flows into teaching also find little change in salary (you'd expect a cut, if teachers are dramatically underpaid). 1/
@CHASE03670 2/ But for the most common teaching spots - say, elementary education - schools receive &gt;100 applications &amp; quality is good. Do those teachers need a pay increase? But rigid pay schedules prevent schools from adjusting pay to supply/demand.
@CHASE03670 Amazingly, I have done my homework. CT tracks teacher applications (number/quality) by position. As we say, there are shortages in specialized areas. So raise pay in those areas. 1/
@CHASE03670 Say, do prospective teachers come from the top of their high school class, etc.
@CHASE03670 There's a fair amount of research on this issue.
@CHASE03670 It's supply and demand. Pro atheletes are the several hundred very best individuals at their profession in the country. Minor league players receive much less, although they're also extremely good.
@CHASE03670 We didn't pick specific jobs in comparing to BLS's 'work level&amp; data. Rather, we used a regression based on various jobs with similar skill levels. This also didn't show a salary penalty for teachers.
@CHASE03670 We link to several studies that look at what teachers make if they shift to non-teachung jobs. None find that teachers make substantially more.
@AndrewScurria @EyeOnPuertoRico @Terpin8or @ricardorossello @SecretaryPerry A less powerful board is fine, if that's what Congress wanted (I think they did). But I think that misunderstanding is behind a lot of dissatisfaction with the FOMB's progress.
@CHASE03670 3/ But if current US teachers aren't as good as in, say, Finland, paying them as if they were Finnish teachers won't change that. Maybe you want new hires treated differently, which may mean higher pay, higher standards, etc. Ok, but that's not the question posed or answered.
@CHASE03670 2/ You're also asking a different question. People claim that public school teachers are paid less than they'd receive in other jobs. That's the claim we checked, and the answer is no. Could the US have better teachers if it paid more? Maybe. See a thread I did yesterday.
@CHASE03670 The OECD figure doesn't include benefits; doesn't compare to other jobs (how do we pay other jobs measured on the same basis?); is on a per-student basis; is percent of GDP, rather than actual resources (does having high GDP make it more expensive to educate a child?) 1/
@CHASE03670 I understand they're different skill sets. But other occupations require soft skills. I'm not sure how that changes the picture. (I'm not trying to be dismissive, just figuring out how you'd work that into a pay comparison.)
@EyeOnPuertoRico @Terpin8or @AndrewScurria @ricardorossello @SecretaryPerry I'm no expert on control/oversight boards, but I don't believe the FOMB has the same powers as the DC control board or Detroit emergency manager. Sometimes people think the FOMB does and get frustrated at the pace of change.

@IndieTinker @AEI It's an impression; but I'm sure you could find data on, say, the number of teachers assaulted in school.
@JimPethokoukis Quantity has a quality all its own.
@IndieTinker @AEI In defense of public school teachers: yes, they're paid more than private school teachers. But think of what public school teachers have to deal with in some schools; not just students who aren't prepared and parents who don't care, but some real behavior problems.
@LeeamLowin I think the real GNP figures are adjusted for inflation back to 1954. I think that's the base year used in Puerto Rico's national accounts. (Why? I don't know.)
@LeeamLowin I wasn't involved with these numbers and maybe my eyes are tired, but it seems that the inflation and real GNP growth rates do add up to the nominal growth rate.
@Rickersam3 There's room for alternate certifications, etc. But other research finds that principals tend to hire teachers like themselves; principals who went the traditional Ed school route hire more traditional students. Principals with stronger backgrounds hire stronger new teachers.
@Rickersam3 Schools can't raise pay to attract the best teachers more or fill shortages because of rigid salary schedules, which in many cases are based ONLY on years of job tenure and educational credentials. Some teaching jobs get 100+ applicants; others 5. But they'll pay the same.
@Rickersam3 8/ It's an involved logic &amp; may not always hold. But the studies I've seen don't show huge effects from raising pay &amp; this may help explain why.	https://t.co/vJB5HNtCr7
@Rickersam3 7/ If higher pay increases the number of applicants, but it's a random process of who gets hired, the best-qualified applicants may have a *lower* chance of being hired. Since they also give up more to major in Ed, it may not be worth their while.
@Rickersam3 6/ The opportunity cost of a great student switching studying Education is higher than for an only-ok student. If an engineering major switches to Ed &amp; doesn't get hired, he's lost a lot. The general studies student who fails to get a teaching job hasn't lost as much.
@Rickersam3 5/ Based on this, Ballou &amp; Podgursky find that higher pay could potentially mean lower quality teachers. The reasons:	https://t.co/uWjommrLaA
@Rickersam3 4/ But longer term, won't higher pay mean better new teachers? Maybe. Dale Ballou found that many schools don't hire better applicants if offered them. So even if higher pay lures some better applicants, they may or may not be chosen. 	https://t.co/HWgTJnAoz9
@Rickersam3 3/ If higher salaries reduce teacher retirements, then fewer new slots open up for new and supposedly better teachers.
@Rickersam3 2/ To start, proposed pay increases will be for all teachers, not just new ones. So, say, Arizona Gov Ducey's promised 20% salary will cost ~$400 million before any new/better teachers are hired. So for the foreseeable future it's more money for the same teachers.
@Rickersam3 This is an interesting topic. Some thoughts: obviously, you'd think higher pay would attract better teachers. The question is, how much better, how quickly, and at what cost? 1/
@gene_krauss @cate_long @CaribbeanHen @BLS_gov That's what I was referring to. What you want to know is the present value of new benefits earned by teachers in the coming year. That's a different number than the amount the government contributes to the plan in that year; they're just not the same, for various reasons.
@Luissilv2000 @smila54 That's true almost everywhere. The counterargument is that many private schools either are religions or have richer, better-behaved kids; in either case, it's supposed that teachers are willing to accept less under those conditions.
@gene_krauss @cate_long @CaribbeanHen @BLS_gov If so, then the smaller COLAs (or other benefit cuts) are reflected in the value of benefits accruing to employees, which is what I measure. But there are well-funded plans (say, Wisconsin) that have reduced COLAs. What you want to know is the benefits being promised each year.

@prwolverine That's a very cogent critique.
@smila54 As with many things in Puerto Rico, the data aren't very good. With mainland teachers the compensation premium comes through employer-paid pension/retiree health benefits, which basically don't exist in PR anymore.
@greavespg 4/ If that doesn't make sense, I'll try to explain it better...
@greavespg 3/ By itself, this skewed education control can create a "pay gap" where one doesn't exist. If over time more teachers have MAs &amp; if the teacher pay increase for having an MA doesn't match the premium private MA holders have over BAs, the rise in teachers w/MAs boost the pay gap.
@greavespg 2/ What I *think* is going on: EPI compares teachers with BAs to others with BAs, and the same for teachers with MAs. This isn't right, since students majoring in Ed aren't as strong as other majors, and Ed MAs are widely regarded to have zero value-added.
@greavespg These are based on EPI numbers, which are wrong for a number of reasons. If you look at actual teacher contracts over time, you don't see this decline. Salaries haven't risen much, but they haven't fallen 20%, etc. That's crazy. 1/
What's the justification for this other than assuming that high earners are very sensitive to marginal tax rates? (Cuomo, meet Kudlow...) https://t.co/zHwXTwk4dM
@JECDems @SSWorks This factoid is indisputably wrong, based on bad data that undercount private retirement plan benefits. In fact, only about 1-in-8 retirees rely on Social Security for 90%+ of their income. Not your fault, JEC Dems; SSA needs to fix these numbers.  https://t.co/2DMzQzx1yz
@StuySquare @HCorderoGuzman @NYSComptroller @NYCComptroller The discount rate used is clearly too high, but I'm very confident (for both legal and political reasons) that the vast majority of promised benefits do end up being paid.
@JanetheActuary @HCorderoGuzman It seems that teacher salaries are actually pretty close to that, since when teachers switch to private jobs they don't make the ~20% more that EPI's figures claim. They make about the same salaries. But teacher benefits are much more generous.
@HCorderoGuzman EPI's wage comparisons are wrong for several reasons (happy to explain), they understate pension benefit accruals (we explain why in the city journal piece) &amp; they ignore retiree health benefits. It's just not a good piece, but unless you know the minutae it's hard to tell.
@JosecirPR Puerto Rico's pensions are essentially zero percent funded and (under the Board's fiscal plan) the median public employee will get nearly 95% of what they've been promised. That's pretty secure.
@HCorderoGuzman I don't like the Manhattan Institute's methodology. The OECD data are interesting, but really not a true public-private pay comparison. The EPI study is wrong in several important ways; it's just not a solid piece of work.
@gene_krauss @cate_long @CaribbeanHen @BLS_gov Each state (and teacher's) situation is unique. These are just averages. But the funding status of a state's pension plan doesn't affect teacher compensation.
@gene_krauss @530BruceRoss I'm happy to have the conversation, if you don't go off the deep end. Both of these objections aren't correct.
@cate_long Infinite, seemingly...
@Terpin8or @cate_long @TimTravis2 I agree on this. People debate over nature vs nurture. Parents are both.
@cate_long @CaribbeanHen @cate_long basically has it right; those are very expensive places to live. The attached adjusts average teacher salaries using @BLS_gov regional price parities; the best-paid states also have high costs of living, so the results shift a bit. Say, Hawaii goes from 17th to 49th. https://t.co/qfYoRMRnyZ
@cate_long @TimTravis2 There's a decent amount of research on that. Mixed results. A good teacher matters, but so much of student outcomes is out of teachers' hands.
This will make me even less popular than I currently am, but you got to follow the numbers...	https://t.co/efep8im4bX
@asymmetricinfo The (semi) opposite is true in policy or more quantitative fields: there's a benefit if you can state complex ideas in simple terms.
@Prof_CEW @CNNMoney @lydiadepillis Also misleading is the claim that "64% of pension funding came from investment earnings." All investment earnings started out as contributions, most of which are made by the govt, not employees. Today, 3/4 of pension contributions are from taxpayers.
@Prof_CEW @CNNMoney The seemingly modest "average pension" includes many short-career employees with low benefits. In terms of benefits earned for each year of work, which is the apples-to-apples measure, public pensions are MUCH more generous than private sector plans.  @lydiadepillis

@ebishop1966 @hiltzikm Others would argue that the rich are able to delay retirement but the poor can't.
@YFeyman @hiltzikm There are slightly differing direct results; the marginal actuarial reduction for claimers at 62-63 is smaller than for those claiming later, &amp; incentives to claim DI are higher. Both probably favor the poor. Delaying claiming reduces benefit cut, but unclear who reacts how.
@hiltzikm And yet, the result is the opposite of what you claim. So static, you're wrong. Dynamic, you're wrong.
@hiltzikm Since this is going nowhere, let me sum up: 		If we gave every retiree an x% benefit cut, would that reduce benefits more for the poor than the rich or the short-lived than the long-lived?		No, by definition they all get x% less. And that's what a retirement age increase does.
@hiltzikm You assume that if the NRA increases by X years, people WILL delay retirement by that amount. If so, great -- their retirement benefits don't change. You don't know that will happen and you don't state your assumption. But you do trumpet your conclusion.
@hiltzikm You don't know which people currently claim at the NRA, which people will delay claiming due to a higher retirement age, or how much they'll delay. Again, if you've got it all figured out, how come CBO's experts found the opposite conclusion? https://t.co/UWaqgpJqrp
@hiltzikm I'm assuming that nothing changes except the normal retirement age. Not claiming ages, not longevity, NOTHING. That's the standard way of handling things. And that shows the opposite of what you claim.
@hiltzikm No you don't, and in fact that's not how SSA or CBO do it.
@AndrewScurria That matters, because the Detroit judge gave bondholders &amp; pensioners similar(ish) percentage cuts to their unfunded claims, which for pensions means the unfunded part of their benefits. In Detroit this was a third or so, but for the main PR pensions it's practically 100%.
@AndrewScurria And their description of Detroit's COLA cuts is misleading. A pension's benefit liabilities includes promised COLA increases. A 1% cut in COLAs reduces pension liabilities by about 10%. I hope @CaribBusiness at least sought comment from the Board on this.
@hiltzikm But the normal retirement age doesn't determine the age at which you claim benefits. It determines the level of benefits you get at any age at which you claim. The EARLY retirement age (62) does limit when you claim, since you can't claim before then. NRA is just a benefit cut.
@hiltzikm They DON'T collect one less year. They collect the same number of years, but less per year. And the amount less is the same for each person, regardless of income or longevity. That's how an increase in the normal retirement age works!
@jbmcgee @hiltzikm I have some CalSTRS data where it might be possible yo check.
@jbmcgee @hiltzikm It would be VERY interesting to calculate IRRs for a state/local pension using individual earnings/benefits records. High earners have faster earnings growth, which lowers the PV of contributions. Plus longer lives. So your average PERS retirement plan may well be regressive.
@hiltzikm OMG, I've made that point myself as a REAL reason not to raise the retirement age, not the bogus one you're relying on.
@hiltzikm Of course that's true. But raising the retirement age doesn't change that because it imposes the same percentage cut on every retiree, whether rich or poor, short-lived or long-lived.
@hiltzikm 3/ Richie's monthly benefit falls to $1,860; over 20 years, he now gets $446,400. 	Pauly's benefit is now $930. Over 10 years, he gets $111,600.	446.4k/480k -1 = -0.07 = 7% cut. 111.6k/120k - 1 = -0.07 = 7% cut. 	IT'S THE SAME PERCENTAGE CUT.
@hiltzikm 2/ Richie Rich gets $2,000 per month and survives 20 years past retirement. His total benefits are $2k*12*20=$480k.	Pauly Poor gets $1,000 p/m, survives 10 years. Total benefits: $120k.	Now the full retirement age rises by 1 year. Both their monthly benefits are cut by about 6%.

@hiltzikm @brookings 10/last So can we stop this bullshit and talk real policy? There's a progressive case to be made on Social Security; so make it, instead of disseminating misleading talking points.
@hiltzikm @brookings 9/ The REAL reason not to raise the retirement age (w/o other compensating reforms) is that the poor rely more on Social Security than the rich, so the same percentage cut in benefits is a larger percentage cut in their total incomes. But longevity has noting to do with that.
@hiltzikm Henry Aaron of @brookings - a leading expert on Social Security, &amp; no right-winger - corrected his colleague for making the same mistake you do. The difference is that Aaron's colleague stopped making the claim after being corrected; you don't.	https://t.co/VyrQNDpWWg https://t.co/LoAHjGC5hx
@hiltzikm 7/ The SSA study documented that the rich increasingly live longer than the poor. You take that to mean that raising the retirement age would be regressive, but that's because (no offense) you misunderstand the SS benefit formula. It's not the SSA actuaries conclusion.
@hiltzikm 6/ Best I can tell, the CRS didn't generate their own numbers. They just cited the GAO &amp; NAS (the GAO is wrong, and CRS didn't cite NAS correctly).
@hiltzikm 5/ But even that result wouldn't show that Social Security becomes less progressive. Even the NAS finds that raising the FRA makes Social Security MORE progressive. https://t.co/ESy0mF9p1P https://t.co/ptMaEe7NuB
@hiltzikm /4 The NAS study doesn't explain its results clearly, Probably, their model assumes that all individuals delay retirement, but the rich do so more than the poor. Maybe, maybe not. But it's the assumption, not the policy, generating the claim that raising the FRA is regressive.
@hiltzikm 3/ How does GAO generate their result? 1. They also assumed the EARLY retirement age increased, which most reforms don't do. 2. They assumed that everyone retired a the full retirement age, which they don't. Those assumptions drive the result, not the full ret age increase.
@hiltzikm 2/ Why? Because raising the full retirement age imposes the SAME PERCENTAGE CUT on all retirees' benefits, BUT people who are disabled &amp; switch to retirement benefits aren't affected. The disabled are more likely to be poor. If you want to know what actually happens, this is it.
@hiltzikm 1/ The CBO, the Urban Institute's Dynasim model, and my own work with the Policy Simulation Group's microsimulation model ALL find that increasing the full (or "normal") retirement age cuts lifetime benefits by more for the rich than the poor. https://t.co/3OlYMUWQxj https://t.co/AO0Vy8noVO

@HCorderoGuzman @JosecirPR In my position, I have to follow my reading of mainstream economic research in this area, which predicts that PR's labor/welfare policies will push employment &amp; wages downward. Exactly how much is *always* hard to say. But from the research literature, the direction is clear.
@RafiArrillaga @HCorderoGuzman @JosecirPR The employment-population ratio (even age-adjusted) tells the same story.
@RafiArrillaga @HCorderoGuzman @JosecirPR Yes, AmeriCorps is around. (My wife was nominated by Obama to the board; the nomination sat for four years without action...)
@HCorderoGuzman @JosecirPR No one has ever said that labor laws explain all of the differences between PR &amp; the mainland in employment and wages, so that's a straw man. The business environment, federal policies, education, etc. also matter. But do the labor laws explain part of it? Sure. Let's fix that.
@HCorderoGuzman @JosecirPR Because long-term, higher labor force participation is make or break for the island. And you're not going to get labor force participation remotely matching the mainland until labor market policies at least come closer to the mainland.
@HCorderoGuzman @JosecirPR Note that due to mandatory benefits, the effective minimum wage - employer costs per hour worked - is probably higher in PR than FL or many other states.
@HCorderoGuzman @JosecirPR Any savings from work requirement will go back to program to improve treatment for beneficiaries who work. We framed it in terms of a higher earned income disregard, so you'd lose less benefits as your income rose. I'm flexible on that end; our point was not to cut PAN benefits.
@HCorderoGuzman @JosecirPR The PAN work requirement will be similar to mainland SNAP; it would apply only to able-bodied adults without dependents; would allow 3 months of benefits before a work requirement kicks in; would allow education or volunteer work to satisfy requirement if jobs not available.
@HCorderoGuzman @JosecirPR Important: you don't need to participate in all to face significant disincentives to work. In an hour of work only nets you another $4 or so in income, some will choose either not to work or to work informally.
@mrsshap @aparnamath https://t.co/Lh10PdbwG4
@HCorderoGuzman @JosecirPR 2/ I wish we had better data showing how many people receive which benefits; with that, we could show the range of disincentives to work. But those disincentives can be meaningful even if you receive only a single benefit, due to high ratio of benefits to potential wages.
@HCorderoGuzman @JosecirPR The report gave a few examples, ranging from receipt of a single benefit (PAN), which lowers the effective hourly wage a lot but doesn't mean it doesn't pay to work; to the ABC analysis in the middle; to Burtless-Sotomayor where it's basically receipt of all possible benefits. 1/
@HCorderoGuzman @JosecirPR The main pitfall I see is that LBPR has been so low for so long that many residents lack much job experience. Because of that, my gut is that the LFPR rate would rise more slowly than than the unemployment rate would fall following a recession.
@HCorderoGuzman @JosecirPR But the labor reforms are more than that. The PAN work requirement won't affect that many people. The EITC, at-will employment, lower benefit costs, min wage will affect more. Plus, improved business environment to increase supply of jobs. No miracles, but it's a start.
@HCorderoGuzman @JosecirPR I wouldn't expect to see much in those charts. First, many other things happening at the same time. Second, the 2017 reforms were modest in both size and scope; only new hires are affected, plus even new rules aren't close to how mainland states regulate their labor markets.
@HCorderoGuzman @JosecirPR I don't run the model, but for policy changes it works on assumptions (based on studies of other experience) of how, say, labor or energy sector reforms affect economic growth.
@HCorderoGuzman @JosecirPR Which is precisely my point: wages and job opportunities are more valuable than high mandated benefits. And when you can't find a job, you get neither.
@jbmcgee @NPR @NPRCoryTurner Could a govt cut benefits accrued in a cash balance plan? You couldn't do that with either a straight DB plan or a 401k-style account.
@HCorderoGuzman What Florida does show is that "horrible" labor laws aren't inconsistent with having plentiful, higher-paying jobs. Seemingly-attractive labor laws, as in Puerto Rico, very likely make jobs fewer and lower-paying.
In most cases teacher unions don't want their members to be signed up for Social Security. On paper that's the right choice - public sector pensions are a much better deal financially - but these days you sure don't want to have all your eggs in the same basket. https://t.co/rHBorUNpyO

@AndrewScurria @Terpin8or @HCorderoGuzman @cate_long @ChSobrino Sure, and I'd love to cut those (and see people who really break the rules pay the legal price). But a Board that dictates policy at that level isn't really what PROMESA lined up. There's much more shared power than in Detroit or DC.
@SaulNazario @AEI @brookings Remember: Board members aren't paid!
@AndrewScurria @Terpin8or @HCorderoGuzman @cate_long @ChSobrino Could be. I don't know how this was handled in Detroit, San Bernardino, etc. But even if you knew (&amp; could enforce) essential-only, the short-term economic effects in PR would be very harmful. And that hurts both residents &amp; creditors.
3/ My apologies; the figures I showed above were for a stylized 'high wage' worker. For a medium wage worker net Social Security benefits would rise by 4-9%. For a low wage worker it would be slightly more. I'm not saying I KNOW the earnings effects. But it's probably not zero.
@Terpin8or @HCorderoGuzman @cate_long @ChSobrino Just for clarity: PROMESA requires that a fiscal plan fund essential services. It doesn't require either govt or board to categorize essential vs non-essential.
2/ If so, mothers' Social Security benefits would rise by 1-4% even after the benefit offset to fund paid leave. @urbaninstitute analysis assumes that paid parental leave has zero effect on mothers' future earnings, which is the goal of the policy. @mrsshap @aparnamath
Paid parental leave helps mothers remain attached to their prior jobs &amp; raises their future earnings. @aei @brookings working group cites research on California paid leave, finding it raises women's work hours in the years following birth by 10-17%. https://t.co/890L8ay7Hw 1/ https://t.co/91zskINfVf

@marywalshnyt I think the COLA is paid mid-year, so if you look at all retirees in a given year half would have received a COLA. I adjusted the average benefit up by half a year's COLA to account for that.
@civicdec @marywalshnyt But, while many OR cities have employees in PERS, benefits are set by the legislature. Plus, I think it's pretty much possible for a city to withdraw.

@DrosteKevin @DeanBaker13 You can get the data from the Oregonian (if you google it, you'll find it). Since the COLA is paid mid-year, I assumed that everyone retiring in 2017 received 1/2 a COLA. Then calculated benefits/replacement rates.
@DrosteKevin @DeanBaker13 In Oregon it wouldn't, because OR employees participate in Social Security. There's no offset for them.
@DrosteKevin @DeanBaker13 Let me check the Social Security; I set those numbers up quickly. if I have an error I'll correct it.
@meepbobeep @DeanBaker13 @GlennonMarkE @jimpalermo @marywalshnyt @Wirepoints @PensionTsunami I'm not saying the data don't exist. But if many teachers quit after a few years, you have a lot of "former teachers" who really spent only a few years in the profession and will get most of their retirement benefits from another job. That's where the "meaningful" part comes in.
The data these numbers are based on - Census's Current Population Survey - fails to measure almost half of the benefits retirees receive from private retirement plans. So don't draw any conclusions from the map. https://t.co/49ybsSgUpZ
@uomatters @jimpalermo @meepbobeep @DeanBaker13 @marywalshnyt @Wirepoints @PensionTsunami Which is why they have Econ 201, since the public sector isn't necessarily a competitive labor market. There are a bunch of ways public sector pay could vary from the market. In your view, it would be literally impossible for a public sector worker to be over/undercompensated.
@ProtectPensions I think 1 of those 4 points is correct.
@uomatters @jimpalermo @meepbobeep @DeanBaker13 @marywalshnyt @Wirepoints @PensionTsunami With Social Security, this means that most OR PERS retirees would have well more than they need for retirement after working 2/3rds of a full career. And on the taxpayers' dime since -- unlike the other 49 states -- OR state employees don't contribute to PERS.
@DeanBaker13 My bad: I calculated the Social Security by running final salary through the PIA formula, so it implicitly assumes 35 years of earnings (even though my retirees had only 25-30 years with OR PERS). So the Social Security is overstated by a bit.
@foswi @DeanBaker13 In a competitive labor market, sure. In the public sector? Not so sure. State govt wages are a little below private sector levels, but probably not enough to offset much more generous benefits.
@DeanBaker13 @GlennonMarkE @jimpalermo @meepbobeep @marywalshnyt @Wirepoints @PensionTsunami A hard question to ask meaningfully. There's a lot of very short career teachers (say, 5-10 years) that cycle through, one after another. But the lion's share of benefits go to longer career teachers.
@DeanBaker13 A 90% replacement rate after 2/3rds of a working career? (Bonus: Oregon State employees don't contribute to their pension.)

@jimpalermo @meepbobeep @DeanBaker13 @marywalshnyt @Wirepoints @PensionTsunami In Oregon replacement rates are going down. 10 years ago they were 100%+, plus Social Security. Scary.
@DeanBaker13 Here's retirees between 25-30 years tenure. Social Security is estimated off final earnings. The average pension replacement rate is 53%; total is 90%. That's 20% points above what financial advisors recommend based on a career 15-20 years shorter than many will work. https://t.co/mgYEPubUd0
@celox1 @SaulNazario @DavidGCrane Future taxpayers don't have a seat at the table. And if you're not at the table, you're on the menu.
@DeanBaker13 Here I excluded any new Oregon retiree with benefits above $100k. It lowers the average benefit by about $2,000, but the replacement rate (which is the better measure of generosity) declines only a little bit. These are simply very generous pensions. https://t.co/oHDeUzYn3Q
@DeanBaker13 I'm running out; will find better numbers later. But in 2017, the average replacement rate in OR for new retirees w/35 years of work was 90% of final pay, PLUS Social Security; so a total replacement rate of ~120% when financial planners say 70% is enough.
@DeanBaker13 The average is drawn down by employees with short careers. Instead, look at annual accruals or full-career benefits. Either will show you a very generous plan.

@ReformedActuary A good point: if the US Treasury is paying $X billion in 2033 to repay the trust fund, it can (and probably will) continue to pay $X billion to Social Security in 2034, even if the trust fund has run dry.
@marywalshnyt @victorsilverman If you want to compare public pensions to private 401ks, you can compare accrued benefits per year or benefits over a full career. Either way, (most) public pensions are much more generous.

@twolfson @KateAronoff You crunch the numbers and get back to me when you've got it sorted out.
@HCorderoGuzman This is the life of the policy wonk. 😀
@KateAronoff @cate_long And I just said that wages won't necessarily reflect societal impact, for *any* job. Wages reflect supply &amp; demand in the labor market. Despite shortages in some areas, lots of people want to be K-12 teachers.
@KateAronoff @cate_long WVa has 718 vacancies out of a 20k+ workforce, mostly in specialized areas. Will a 5% pay raise to all teachers be enough to fill gaps in those specialized areas? Maybe not. Does it create incentives for new teachers to specialize in needed areas? No.
@KateAronoff @cate_long If teachers produce huge societal gains (some do, others maybe not) &amp; only current teachers could do that job, salaries would be very high. But for most teaching jobs, schools receive many qualified applicants. So wages are set to attract qualified teachers. That's labor markets.
@KateAronoff @cate_long A side note: Maybe I'm right or wrong, but I can obviously support my case pretty well. It would be nice if people from different sides could make their cases without the usual insults and aspersions.
@KateAronoff @cate_long EG, if this BLS study were applied to public school teachers (not general state/local workers, who also claim to be vastly underpaid) I guarantee you it would show comparable wages &amp; more generous benefits. https://t.co/KpZBpdLKmE
@KateAronoff @cate_long 2. The BLS analyzes the skill requirements of many different types of jobs. If teachers were underpaid, their salaries would be lower than jobs with similar skill requirements.
@KateAronoff @cate_long 1. If teachers were underpaid, you'd expect teachers who left for other jobs to make more (and for private sector workers switching to teaching to make less). Multiple studies show that doesn't happen.
@KateAronoff @cate_long States w/similar poverty rates can have very different costs of living &amp; teacher salaries. What matters is how well teacher wages compare to alternate jobs teachers might take. Multiple data source show teacher salaries close to alternate jobs. Plus pensions &amp; retiree health.

@JohnCScott_DC @Frugal_Saver @TobiasRead @ORSaves @annetergesen @SingletaryM For the *average* federal employee; I believe they earn about $90k p/y. For workers w/less than a HS education, who'd be a big part of auto-IRA plans, new debt outweighed savings by 3-to-1. That should be concerning.
@someguyjack @JohnArnoldFndtn You read about teacher shortages, and they exist for specialized spots (let's raise their pay). But for typical K-12 teacher positions, which make up maybe 3/4 of all spots, Connecticut's been receiving 50 applications per opening.
@Frugal_Saver @JohnCScott_DC @TobiasRead @ORSaves @annetergesen @SingletaryM The Beshears et al result that auto-enrolled low-earners accumulated new debt 3x their new savings is a difficult one, given that there's not much evidence that low-earners are actually saving less than they should (eg, poverty rates fall in retirement, not increase).
@JohnArnoldFndtn I wonder how much of this has to do with, say, teacher demographics (eg, changes in average teacher tenure) vs pensions. Say, California has increased teacher salaries a lot despite rising @calstrs costs, while decently-funded states like Washington seem to have cut salaries.

@cate_long @Terpin8or Leaving aside that pension liabilities are calculated using a too-high discount rate (a very big 'leaving aside'), both the pension liability and the face value of debt should reflect the discounted value of the cash flows offered.
@cate_long @Terpin8or Because the baseline pension liability as published in actuarial reports, etc. includes the value of COLAs. If you cut COLAs, the liability is reduced.
@cate_long @Terpin8or And even with that additional state funding, there was still a roughly 20% cut to benefits.
@RetireRevised Am I shocked that the state with the 48th lowest median household income and the 45th lowest cost of living (West Virginia) has the 48th lowest teacher salaries? No. It would be odd if pay weren't in some way calibrated to the labor market.

@cate_long I'm on an airplane, so basically no. But Google it and you can piece it together.
@cate_long A 1 percentage point cut in pension COLAs reduces liabilities by about 10%. I think Detroit public safety COLAs were cut by 1.25% while regular employees COLAs were eliminated.
@cate_long Public safety had a separate (and less onerous) deal from the regular system. I didn't produce the figure cited in the op-ed, but my guestimate of the regular system cuts was about 22% so I think it's solid.
@cate_long Detroit's pension cuts included cuts to COLAs, so pension liabilities fell more than the value of the initial cut.
@kearney_melissa I don't disagree with a balanced taxes/cuts deal; it's hard to see how else the fiscal gap get resolved. But, rather than a broad agreement, it's a relatively narrow slice of the center that favors this approach. The cores of both parties are  opposed to one part or the other.

@IlliniBizDean @kalamarides @ernietedeschi @washingtonpost That's the key: let small businesses take advantage of economies of scale, but don't allow any spreading of liabilities (say, legal liabilities regarding portfolio design or admin costs) from one employer to another.
@JanetheActuary Exactly; higher income people (and probably many middle income people) would be better off putting the extra money in their 401k. So I don't think this works as a voluntary policy; you'd have to mandate it.
@PaulNVandeWater @MarcGoldwein @ernietedeschi @washingtonpost I agree with Paul; from an economic perspective, SS wealth acts as wealth. But doesn't that undercut Ernie's proposal? When SS/pension wealth are combined, the poor don't have lower retirement wealth/income ratios than the rich. So what problem are we solving here?
@RafiArrillaga This is a good point, though the Board is mindful of the problems you raise. Still, I agree that - both now and in the future - Puerto Rico could benefit from an independent budget scorekeeper similar to the @uscbo.

@investing_in_ed @JosecirPR The reason a public plan need not be fully funded is because it can shift costs to future taxpayers. But if you care about intergenerational equity, which public plans purport to and which they should, then public plans should be fully funded.
@investing_in_ed @JosecirPR The only way future taxpayers don't get burdened with paying for past benefits is if plans return to full funding solely by virtue of high investment returns. Since most financial advisers think that current assumed rates (7.5% or so) are already too high, that's pretty unlikely.
@JosecirPR @investing_in_ed Corporate pensions are insured by the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation, so if a plan becomes insolvent the PBGC covers unfunded benefits (up to a limit).
@investing_in_ed @JosecirPR An underfunded corporate plan can shift costs to future taxpayers if it becomes insolvent (if not, shareholders bear the cost). An underfunded government plan almost certainly will shift costs to future taxpayers, since they'll have to make contributions to cover past shortfalls.

@JosecirPR If you're promising a riskless, come-what-may, no-matter-what benefit, then the discount rate should come from riskless assets like Treasuries. Maybe with some adjustment, but that's basically it.
@hiltzikm I could pull up data on status, but it doesn't matter that much. Say, when the stock market drops the corporation still has to pony up more cash.
Corporate pensions: 86% funded using a 3.9% discount rate. State/local plans: ~72% using a 7.5% rate. We can argue over what's the correct discount rate, but it's a fact that corporate pensions have set aside twice as much money for each $1 of promised benefits as govt plans. https://t.co/JDTHinh8J9
@ritholtz @BV Your big-picture may be right. But most private pensions aren't 'wildly underfunded' (state/local govt is a different story). And on reitree health, I think the USPS would fund benefits as they accrue, which is different than for employees not yet hired/born.
@quirkyllama @kdrum @MotherJones I think this piece from a few years back holds up reasonably well. It doesn't say whether teacher compensation is rising or falling, but maybe repeating it with a sample from, say, 20 years ago would give an idea. https://t.co/qdK0u1MDQl

3/ I don't know how a bondholders vs pensioners suit would be judged, but what happens if the creditors won such a suit? Cuts to pensions could end up being far larger than in the Board's proposal. If I were the typical retired public employee, that's not a risk I'd want to take.
2/ I'm not a lawyer nor do I have inside knowledge, but my guess is that many bondholders wouldn't challenge a pension reduction plan like that proposed by the Board. But they probably *would* challenge a plan with zero pension reductions while bondholders take a large hit.
Refusing any pension reductions may be good politics, but it puts Puerto Rico retirees at risk. The Board's 10% proposed cut would not cut benefits for retirees with pension/Social Security benefits below $1,000, and the typical (median) retiree would have only about a 5% cut. 1/ https://t.co/MFJhK81NXr

@lenburman @IlliniBizDean 2/ Plus, raising salaries for existing teachers will reduce turnover, slowing the inflow of new teachers. And Ballou (in the QJE) finds that schools often don't hire better-qualified teachers even when offered them. While I'm fine on paying more for better, it could be tricky.
@lenburman @IlliniBizDean If I remember Chetty right, you get the same gains from dismissing a poor performing teacher, and I'd guess that's easier. Raising salaries for new teachers almost impossible w/o also for current teachers; so initially, it's extremely expensive for small potential gain. 1/
@Frugal_Saver @kalamarides @idarademacher @johnbeshears @ORSaves @MikeMcLaneOR I doubt Oregon will have the credit report data to check how low earners' borrowing changed after auto-enrollment. So you'll probably end up with a skewed picture of the overall effects of auto-enrollment, looking only at the asset side of the ledger.
@IlliniBizDean And, applying the same work year/local cost of living adjustment to California teachers, the average salary is about $72k, $10k more than in Oklahoma. So while these news stories often seem cherry-picked to me, there's probably a case to be made in OK.
@IlliniBizDean That said, the 2017 average OK teacher is slightly lower after inflation than in 2007. Employer pension costs have gone up a little, but not so much as in some other places. So OK salaries, while not obviously too low to my eyes, are probably less competitive than in the past.
@IlliniBizDean From pension system data, the average OK teacher salary last year was $46,878; average age 46, 11 years avg service. Assuming a 10 month work year and using BEA regional price parities, that's annualized/nationalized at $62,574.
@Frugal_Saver @kalamarides @idarademacher @johnbeshears I've seen reasonable explanations for the debt effects of auto-enrollment on the *average* worker; more expensive houses, etc. But for lower wage workers, new doubt outweighs new savings by 3-to-1; even excluding mortgage debt, consumer/auto debt offsets ~80% of new savings.
@n_rhee This is the very poorest 10% of the retiree population. If SSA is arguing that one-third of retirees receive &gt;90% of their income from Social Security, isn't it a little surprising that even this group doesn't?
Unbeatable. https://t.co/ljMAhYTqtY
@n_rhee Just to follow up: even in the poorest 10% of retirees, combined Social Security/SSI make up only 85% of average incomes. Since this is group is very low-income, you'd expect that almost all would hit the 90% reliance threshold, but it's likely that less than half do.

@MichaelRStrain @AEI @ben_ippolito "But the report ignores the fact that pharmaceuticals are nearly always 'on sale.'" It's like a mattress store.
@n_rhee DI matters only for 65-year olds; after that they're on retirement.  SSI is a legit point, but it matters a lot for the bottom 10% of retirees, but less above that. The fact that median (not mean) retirement incomes in IRS data are 30% higher than in the CPS is great.
@DennisG_Shea @AEIecon @Forbes I've seen Radners's work at SSA, but not the paper with Crystal. So that explains the omission. Links, please! 😀

SSA claims that 1/3rd of retirees receive nearly all their income from Social Security. But @ici and @irs researchers found that, even in the poorest fifth of retirees, Social Security makes up only half their incomes. Better data make for better policy. https://t.co/MLHXlbLnh4
@JosecirPR @pnf_phytrade @MUDDLAW @Luissilv2000 @gillamhall I suspect not. The pension reduction amount was set in consideration of the substantial sacrifices being required of other stakeholders. In that context, cuts for retirees - which again, will typically be only around 5% - seem reasonable.
@JosecirPR @pnf_phytrade @MUDDLAW @Luissilv2000 @gillamhall Also bear in mind that the Detroit pensions, while underfunded, were still much better funded than any of the Puerto Rico retirement systems. Had Detroit's pensions been insolvent it's likely that benefit cuts would have been even larger.
@JosecirPR @pnf_phytrade @MUDDLAW @Luissilv2000 @gillamhall That was the upfront reduction; Detroit pensioners also had their COLAs cut, which has a big effect on liabilities.
@pnf_phytrade @JosecirPR @MUDDLAW @Luissilv2000 @gillamhall The Gov originally proposed a 2.5% cut, vs the Board's 10%. Later the govt shifted back to a 0% cut. For context, in Detroit the two pension plans were cut 13% (public safety) and 22% (regular employees).
@pnf_phytrade @MUDDLAW @JosecirPR @Luissilv2000 @gillamhall That's basically how it works. The higher your benefit, the higher the percentage cut; around 20% for the very highest pensions. But the typical retiree would receive a cut of only about 5%.
@n_rhee Just not nearly so much as people claim. https://t.co/XvOtIHrNlV
@MUDDLAW @HCorderoGuzman @Luissilv2000 @gillamhall Yes, it is.
@MUDDLAW @JosecirPR @pnf_phytrade @Luissilv2000 @gillamhall Yes; no benefit reductions for retirees whose combined pension and Social Security benefit is less than $1,000 per month.
@HCorderoGuzman @Luissilv2000 @MUDDLAW @gillamhall You'd get $1,075, a reduction of $25 per month.
@MUDDLAW @JosecirPR @pnf_phytrade @Luissilv2000 @gillamhall The $1,000 cut-off point is the sum of the retirees' pension &amp; Social Security. If you don't receive Social Security (like teachers &amp; police) you can have a higher pension before any reductions begin.

@pnf_phytrade @Luissilv2000 @MUDDLAW @gillamhall That 35% figure of mainland retirees relying solely in Social Security isn't right; it's actually much lower than that.	https://t.co/XvOtIHrNlV
@HCorderoGuzman @Luissilv2000 @MUDDLAW @gillamhall Pensions aren't cut down to the poverty level. They're untouched if under $1,000. And if you're currently receiving (say) $2,000, that would be cut to about $1,750.

@FloMartinSec @MichaelRStrain @AEIecon @Forbes Um, the IRS and the Census Bureau. Because it's not "my data," it's theirs.
If you can read only one recent paper on retirement, read this one by @Mitchell_JoshW &amp; @AdamBeeEcon in m https://t.co/7s0fTW3edW
@FloMartinSec @MichaelRStrain @AEIecon @Forbes I'll let the data speak for itself, if that's okay by you.
The Social Security Administration says that one-third of retirees receive nearly all their income from Social Security. The true figure is only around one-third that amount. @aeiecon @forbes #retirement https://t.co/nDTiOFmcv9

@markjrowlinson @michaelwhite @JohnRalfe1 @NormaCohen3 @csgmoore @Sjg3G @econbuttonwood @RickyTutin @nickcroom But a) the current generation at least includes partial careers for the people who benefited from underfunding; and b) the political economy of the pensions debate remains to shift costs to the future. In practice, I have very little worry that current stakeholders will overpay.
