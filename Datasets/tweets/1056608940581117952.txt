@NancyPelosi @GerryConnolly @realDonaldTrump We need leadership from our government not partisan politics that leave us at a stalemate regarding #Yemen due to @SpeakerRyan's outlandish and self serving behaviors. What care or concern has he offered to #yemenchildren suffering from #YemenFamine? @GOP https://t.co/XMHkC5FmUN
@NancyPelosi @GerryConnolly @realDonaldTrump @SpeakerRyan shows his indifference and lack of compassion for the STARVING #YemenChildren in #Yemen by his actions! @SpeakerRyan should resign immediately he lacks insight into #ForeignAffairs It is disgusting his partisan bullying tactics. #HConRes138 @GOP https://t.co/c0zOFjUDgd
@NancyPelosi @GerryConnolly @realDonaldTrump Shame on the @GOP leadership and their lack of ethics and a moral compass. @SpeakerRyan should be ashamed of his manipulation and antics to block a vote from coming to the floor via #HConRes138 Utterly shocking and his abuse of discretion is reprehensible.
