Director Wray: This announcement would not have been possible without the dedication and hard work of scores of #FBI personnel in our Counterintelligence and Criminal Investigative Divisions, and in our @NewYorkFBI, @FBIDallas, and @FBISeattle field offices.
Director Wray: Today’s charges serve as a warning that the FBI does not – and will not – tolerate businesses that violate our laws, obstruct our justice, and jeopardize our national security.
Director Wray: As Americans, we should all be concerned about the potential for any company beholden to a foreign government – especially one that doesn’t share our values – to burrow into the American telecommunications market.
Director Wray: There is no place for this criminal behavior in our country or any other committed to the rule of law. The prosperity that drives our economic security is inherently linked to our national security.
Director Wray: Huawei also intentionally and systematically sought to steal valuable intellectual property from an American company, so it could circumvent hard-earned, time-consuming research and gain an unfair market advantage.
Director Wray: Huawei and its senior executives repeatedly refused to respect the laws of the United States and standard international business practices.
Director Wray: Both sets of charges expose Huawei’s brazen and persistent actions to exploit American companies and financial institutions, and to threaten the free and fair global marketplace.
Director Wray: The charges unsealed today are the result of years of investigative work by the #FBI and our law enforcement partners.

Director Wray: It’s going to take all of us working together to protect our economic security and our way of life. The American people expect and deserve no less.
Director Wray: We’re going to keep tackling this illegal behavior w/ everything we’ve got – every investigative technique, every piece of intelligence, &amp; every partnership, from our federal, state, local, &amp; int'l partners, to our private sector, community, &amp; academic partners.
Director Wray: We’re deeply concerned about American innovation ending up in the wrong hands…this is conduct that hurts American businesses, hurts American jobs, &amp; hurts American consumers.
Director Wray: We also worked with our counterparts in the NCIS to investigate APT10’s theft of personally identifiable information from more than 100,000 U.S. Naval service members
Director Wray: After identifying additional victims here in the U.S. &amp; around the world, the #FBI’s Cyber Action Team – our elite rapid deployment force – &amp; our #cyber counterparts at @DHSgov deployed to multiple locations to provide technical support &amp; investigative assistance.
Director Wray: We also appreciate our partners in the @DeptofDefense’s Computer Forensic Laboratory, who worked with us as we analyzed hundreds of malware samples.
Director Wray: We are incredibly grateful not only to our @TheJusticeDept colleagues, but to our partners at the @RealNCIS, the Defense Criminal Investigative Service, &amp; @DHSgov for their work.
Director Wray: The scope of this investigation was broad, as you can imagine, including our FBI field offices @FBINewOrleans, @NewYorkFBI, @FBISacramento, @FBISanAntonio, and @FBIHouston.
Director Wray: The members of APT10 conducted major computer intrusion campaigns, targeting U.S. government agencies &amp; companies both in the U.S. &amp; around the world, &amp; stealing hundreds of gigabytes of intellectual property &amp; confidential business information.
Director Wray: The actors named in this indictment were members of a hacking group operating in China that is associated with the Chinese Ministry of State Security – a group known as APT10.
Director Wray: And while we welcome fair competition, we cannot and will not tolerate illegal hacking, stealing, and cheating.
Director Wray: China’s goal, simply put, is to replace the U.S. as the world’s leading superpower – and they’re using illegal methods to get there.
Director Wray: As evidenced by this investigation, the threats we face have never been more pervasive or more potentially damaging to our national security. No country poses a broader, more severe, &amp; long-term threat to our nation’s economy &amp; cyber infrastructure than China.

“If the evolution of the terrorist threat has taught the FBI anything, it’s that we need to adapt to whatever challenges are coming around the bend—quickly and fluidly.” Director Wray on the importance of the #FBI evolving alongside a changing landscape.
#FBI Director Wray: “When I say innovation, I’m not just talking about #technology—it can be anything that helps us bridge a gap in an operational need or that makes us more effective in carrying out the mission.”
One of my priorities is making the #FBI a more agile &amp; resilient org that’s nimble &amp; fosters creativity &amp; ingenuity; that creates more &amp; tries more. One that embraces the risk of failure, when it’s part of a process to improve, inside the rules but outside the box. – Dir. Wray
#FBI Director Wray about the importance of leveraging #intelligence to combat #terrorism: We know that if we’re to be truly effective with intelligence, we’ve got to get even better at collecting, analyzing, and sharing intelligence across everything we do.
#FBI Dir. Wray: We've got to keep building good relationships with the communities we serve. We’ve got to earn their trust &amp; encourage them to contact law enforcement when they see/hear something that doesn’t seem right. The threats we face are bigger than any one of us. (2/2)
#FBI Director Wray: “Our success is going to depend on strong #partnerships—with our partners in the community; with our state and local law enforcement partners; and with our intelligence #community partners, both here at home and around the world.” (1/2)
#FBI Director Wray on his vision for confronting the threat of terrorism: "I believe three things are crucial: #partnerships, #intelligence, and #innovation."
#FBI Director Wray: The threat posed by homegrown violent extremists is a new constant, and it has created a new set of challenges: a much greater number of potential threats, each with far fewer dots to connect, and much less time in which to prevent or disrupt an attack.
#FBI Director Wray: #NationalSecurity remains our top priority, and #counterterrorism, of course, is still a paramount concern. But the primary terrorist threat to the homeland today, without question, is homegrown violent extremists.
Director Wray spoke about how the #FBI has changed since September 11, 2001: It’s remarkable to see firsthand the capabilities we’ve built with our #partners, both here and around the world. Today, we’re all stronger, smarter, and better able to confront the threats we face.
#FBI Director Wray speaking about the FBI’s unwavering commitment to protecting our country from terrorism: “We wake up every morning asking ourselves, 'what do we need to do to keep people safe today, and tomorrow, and the day after that?'"
#FBI Director Christopher Wray is with @FBISaltLakeCity and @DUTnews today to speak at the 11th Annual Utah National Security and Anti-Terrorism Conference. Follow along with @FBI starting at 10:30 AM ET/8:30 AM MT for excerpts from his remarks.

Director Wray: I’m confident that by working together &amp; finding similar areas to agree &amp; compromise, we can come up with solutions to the #GoingDark problem. https://t.co/n4d39PmHRv
Director Wray: FBI is on the front line fighting #cyber crime &amp; economic espionage, but info security programs need to be thoughtfully designed so they don’t undermine the lawful tools we need to keep the American people safe. #BCCS
Director Wray: #GoingDark is a problem that impacts our investigations across the board – from #humantrafficking to counterterrorism, gangs to organized crime, child exploitation to #cyber. #BCCS
Director Wray: In FY2017, the FBI was unable to access the content on nearly 7,800 devices tied to a specific subject, defended, victim, or threat. #GoingDark #BCCS
Director Wray: One of our biggest challenges connected to the digital revolution is the #GoingDark problem. #BCCS
Director Wray: The #FBI needs to be a force of specialized, technically trained personnel that is cutting-edge, forward-leaning, and able to fully investigate &amp; combat diverse #cyber threats. #BCCS
Director Wray: I believe the new digital environment demands further fundamental transformation from us as an organization. #BCCS
Director Wray: We have to recognize that there’s now a technology &amp; digital component to almost every case. Transnational crime groups, sexual predators, fraudsters, &amp; terrorists are transforming the way they do business as technology evolves. #BCCS
Director Wray: We can no longer just investigate individual parts of a criminal scheme in one jurisdiction – we need to focus our efforts on dismantling the entire #cyber enterprise. #BCCS
Director Wray: When there are indications of unauthorized access, malware, loss of data, potential for impact on nat’l security, economic security, or public health &amp; safety, call us. #BCCS
Director Wray: We also work more closely with our foreign partners – we have #cyber agents embedded with our int’l counterparts, helping to build relationships &amp; coordinate investigations. #BCCS
Director Wray: To those of you in the private sector, it doesn’t matter if you call us, @DHSgov, or another agency – we all work together. Call as promptly as possible. #BCCS
Director Wray: We’re also building on our #partnerships. One of the things that’s jumped out at me since coming back to the FBI is how much more committed &amp; enthusiastically invested we are in partnerships. #BCCS

Director Wray: We are recruiting from the outside &amp; bolstering our training inside the FBI to give our agents &amp; analysts the skills &amp; experience they need to work #cyber cases. #BCCS
Director Wray: We have #Cyber Action Teams ready to deploy at a moment’s notice and Cyber Task Forces in every field office to respond to breaches, conduct investigations, and collect intelligence. #BCCS
Director Wray: So what is the #FBI doing about the #cyber threat? We are building on our capabilities, strengthening our #partnerships &amp; defenses, exchanging info, and imposing costs on criminals. #BCCS
Director Wray: We’ve also begun seeing a “blended threat” – nation-states using criminal hackers to do their dirty work. #BCCS
Director Wray: We’re seeing an increase in nation-stated sponsored computer intrusions, like last year’s WannaCray ransomware attack. #BCCS
Director Wray: The #FBI &amp; our partners are worried about a wider range of threat actors and a wider gamut of methods – from botnets to ransomware, from spearfishing &amp; BEC to swarmbotting. #BCCS
Director Wray: The last time I had to think seriously about #cyber security through a law enforcement &amp; nat’l security perspective was 13 years ago. Fair to say that no area has evolved more dramatically since then. #BCCS

#FBI Director Wray: At the end of the day, we all want the same thing: to protect our innovation, our systems, and above all, our people. #ICCS2018
Dir. Wray: This requires all of us to raise our game, whether we’re in law enforcement, government, the private sector, the tech industry, the security field or academia. #ICCS2018
#FBI Dir. Wray: One thing that is clear is the urgency of the task we all face. High-impact intrusions are becoming more common, the threats are growing more complex &amp; the stakes are higher than ever.  #ICCS2018
Dir. Wray: This problem will require a thoughtful &amp; sensible approach. We have people devoted to working with stakeholders to find a way forward. We need the private sector’s help. #GoingDark  #ICCS2018
#FBI Dir. Wray: Being unable to access those devices is a major public safety issue &amp; impacts our investigations across the board – #humantrafficking, #counterterrorism, counterintelligence, gangs, organized crime, child exploitation &amp; #cyber. #GoingDark #ICCS2018
Dir. Wray: We were unable to access the content of 7,775 devices using appropriate &amp; available technical tools last fiscal year. #GoingDark  #ICCS2018
Dir. Wray: Another challenge connected to the digital revolution is the #GoingDark problem that grows larger &amp; more complex every day. #ICCS2018

Dir. Wray: The #FBI is focused on building our digital capabilities &amp; focusing on our people to make sure we continue to attract the right skills &amp; talent. #ICCS2018
Dir. Wray: Just as the #FBI changed after 9/11, the new digital environment demands further fundamental transformation from us. #ICCS2018
Dir. Wray: New technical trends are making the investigative environment a lot more complex. The digital environment also presents new challenges that the #FBI has to address. #ICCS2018
Dir. Wray: #FBI has to recognize that that there’s a #technology &amp; digital component to almost every case we have.  Transnational crime groups, sexual predators, fraudsters &amp; terrorists are transforming the way they do business as technology evolves. #ICCS2018
Dir. Wray: #FBI treats victim companies as victims. Call us if there is an intrusion that could affect critical infrastructure, impact nat’l security, public safety or results in significant loss of data. We want to help &amp; our focus will be on doing everything we can. #ICCS2018

Dir. Comey: Op. Cross Country has been an ongoing effort for 10 yrs because the danger facing these kids is still out there.
Dir. Comey: Office of Victim’s Assistance offered resources to provide help to each of these children to get them off the street.
#FBI Dir. Comey: In the last week in the US, we rescued 82 minors &amp; arrested 239 traffickers and their associates.
#FBI Dir. Comey: Task forces across country &amp; around the world went out &amp; tried to hunt down those engaged in sex trafficking of children

Thank you @theIACP for hosting the #FBI #IACP2016
Dir. Comey: We need to lead well &amp; to collect accurate &amp; complete information to inform the policing debates in this country #IACP2016
Dir. Comey: We are flawed, but we must and we will work to get better. #IACP2016
"We need to show ppl what American law enforcement is really like, bc if they see what we see, the chasm will close." #IACP2016
Dir. Comey: As we work to close the chasm, we need to show young ppl of America what it is like to choose service over self #IACP2016
Dir. Comey: Police officers are overwhelmingly good people. They are ppl who took exhausting, dangerous jobs bc they want to help ppl.
Dir. Comey: The spotlight on law enforcement is brighter &amp; the standards higher than other vocations, but that's the way it should be
Dir. Comey: If they stop signing up, the day will come when we will be deeply sorry we failed to show them the true heart of law enforcement
Dir. Comey: We need people of great character &amp; talent out there as police officers. #IACP2016
Dir. Comey: This threatens the future of policing, so we have to talk about it as well. #IACP2016
Dir. Comey: As you work to close the chasm, we face the threat from the narrative that policing is biased, violent &amp; unfair. #IACP2016
"Those are the kind of leaders many communities have. I have come to know many of you. Thank you for caring for your officers &amp; communities"
Dir. Comey: Good leaders show both sides what good policing is and that we need it. That's how the chasm will close. #IACP2016
Dir. Comey:  Good leaders should talk to their communities &amp; elected leaders &amp; show what good policing is. #IACP2016
"The leaders we need agonize over this &amp; refuse to stop talking about this...to their citizens, to media, leaders &amp; officers."
"Into the gap of distrust fall more dead young black men. Places like Chicago we see what the chasm looks like &amp; how much pain it causes."
"Good leaders see that this is only one side of the divide, on the other side they know stand good ppl who saw something or know something."
Dir. Comey: Good leaders know our officers saw what happened in Dallas, Palm Springs &amp; Baton Rouge &amp; think about it all the time. #IACP2016
Dir. Comey: The narrative can divide us, and change us.  #IACP2016
Dir. Comey: The leaders we need know we must change that and show America what is true and accurate, whatever that is. #IACP2016
Dir. Comey: In the absence of information, we have anecdotes &amp; we have videos. The narrative dominates &amp; changes everything. #IACP2016
Dir. Comey: We do not know whether number of black, brown or white people being shot by police is up bc we have not collected data #IACP2016
Dir. Comey: It is a narrative that has formed, in the absence of good information &amp; in the absence of actual data. #IACP2016
Dir. Comey: The leaders we need understand that challenges are multiplied by a narrative forming about American policing. #IACP2016
Dir. Comey: We need leaders that know what good policing looks like &amp; have lived it. We need leaders that know the neighborhoods #IACP2016
Dir. Comey: The leaders we need became cops &amp; sheriffs to do good..they signed up to serve all people. #IACP2016
Dir. Comey: There is a need for leadership in the middle of the riptides that law enforcement face. #IACP2016
Dir. Comey: Law enforcement officers are caught in difficult &amp; dangerous riptides #IACP2016

Dir. Comey: Our job is to investigate using the tools we are given by law, &amp; to tell the American ppl when our tools are ineffective #ASIS16
Dir. Comey: No such thing as absolute privacy in America–no place out of judicial reach. This was the bargain our founders struck. #ASIS16

Dir. Comey: The number of travelers we spot, interdict, or disrupt has dropped significantly, but I don’t want to be overconfident.” #ASIS16
Dir. Comey: In countering terrorism, we're not just looking for needles in a haystack, we need to know who might turn into a needle. #ASIS16
