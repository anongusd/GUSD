Adds that “two-thirds of the things we’ve talked about here we wouldn’t need congress for anyway.” (Mitch McConnell May disagree.)
Asked how he’d unify the country, Hickenlooper says he’d go see Mitch McConnell. “I understand he’s the enemy. I understand he wouldn’t do anything.” Gotta do it anyway.

“We’ve got to make sure we don’t get caught up in divisive stuff” as we fight climate change, Hickenlooper says.
Pivots quickly to clean energy economy
“Hydrocarbons are what creates climate change. Not fracking.”
Hick says he drank frack fluid because he was “trying to build some trust” with oil and gas executives, who took a swig first to try to prove that fracking was safe.
A Hick paean to regulations. “Without regulations our system would be bankrupt.” (He’s addressing housing here rather than fracking)
And we have our first fracking q.
Hick talks about closing coal plants, methane limits etc. says climate is a big issue but he doesn’t want to say one is number one so not to alienate others w other priorities.
While I’m live-tweeting Hick in Des Moines.... https://t.co/8qC1uwyGWD
Next q: Why not follow Inslee’s lead and make climate main issue. “My top priority is to get people to work together,” Hickenlooper replies.
“I don’t see easy solutions there,” Hickenlooper says, referring specifically to lack of affordability in NY, LA and SF. Discussion of tax incentives, vouchers etc
Hick talks about raising minimum wage and eitc but says maybe you’d have to raise wages slower in rural areas.
“Right now our system of capitalism isn’t working for the middle class,” Hick tells the first questioner, who asks how she can afford to live in places there are jobs. cc Morning Joe
Hick talks about his primary rivals: “People in Washington, they spend their time talking about things and debating and pointing fingers. It’s about time to bring things together and get things done.”
Hick’s campaign shtick is heavy in getting people to work together, solving the “crisis of division” in the US, and he’s sticking to it here.
“We now have more than 1000 miles of bike trails” in Denver, Hick boasts. The crowd in this riverside brewpub says “wow.”
Hick begins by recounting his unlikely transformation into a political when he was 50. “Of all the people who are running for president or talking about it, I will wager you I’m the only one who never ran for student council.”

@xieish @EPankowski I’m not sure how you’d run that but it certainly appears not. I can’t think of a single big “far left” win in a competitive race last year (far left defined as someone opposed by party establishment)
@aysrick In fact progressives lost almost all the competitive primaries. The ones they won were in safe seats (AOC, Pressley) or Florida Gov, which they then lost in the general
@aysrick This is remarkably wrong. There were competitive primaries for most races and the toughest general election races were won by centrists (or at least those backed by party establishment, centrist v left is a funky spectrum)

@mattdpearce See my next tweet though. Part of this is clearly politics but he probably would have given a similar answer a decade ago
Part of this is obviously the realities of the 2020 D party but tbf Hick has always hated labels and foundered when asked about ideology etc.

@aseitzwald trying to check w Denver authorities but that seems a bit optimistic
@danacoffield Right? You couldn’t design a worse situation for a Hick slip and yet he did well
Ends after 20 minutes. Definitely the best delivery of a speech I’ve ever heard from Hickenlooper, who is not known for his speaking prowess.
“Being a pragmatist doesn’t mean saying no to bold ideas. It means knowing how to make them happen,” Hickenlooper says.
Now praising Dem party as party of MLK, social security etc. as governor, Hick shied away from party labels.
“My story is proof that big dreams can come true,” Hick says.
Hick is a lot more fiery than normal. He’s closing with a John Muir quote though, so he’s still Hick.
Also pledges to reform criminal justice system in a way that recognizes historic injustices and slavery.
Also pledges to rejoin Paris Accords, create green jobs etc
Hick also pledges closing corporate tax loopholes. Sounds very different than he did as Gov.
“When I’m president we will declare that health care is a universal right,” Hickenlooper promises
@TylerDinucci @alexburnsNYT Probably only a matter of time
Recycling a 2016 line Hick recounts his business rise and says he learned something Trump doesn’t know, it’s not how many times you say “you’re fired” it’s how many times you say “you’re hired.”
“Now that’s what you can do when you bring people together,” Hickenlooper says.
Now rattling off limits on methane emissions, gun control, light rail and other achievements
Hick recalls his first term, filled w fires, floods and mass shootings. “I went to 32 funerals in my first four years.”
“The only way to end the Trump crisis of division is w a leader who knows how to bring people together and get things done,” Hickenlooper says in what’s basically his campaign slogan.
“This isn’t about unity for unity’s sake,” Hick prefaces his big applause line and says “it’s time to bring all Americans together!”
Longtim #copolitics folks will know how remarkable it is that Hick has followed his prepared speech almost perfectly
Hick says Trump measures his success in the number of people he tears down. “These are not the metrics of America’s greatness.”
(Very on brand)
Hick opens by quoting Wallace Stegner calling the west as “the home of hope”
Webb says he’s worked for and endorsed 3 men who were govs — Jimmy Carter, Bill Clinton and now Hick. And Hick’s up.
There’s a clutch of protesters elsewhere in the park and they have a bullhorn. They’re making themselves heard over the speeches though can’t make out what they’re saying.
Webb calls Hick “one of the most qualified people to be president in the history of the United States.”
“Here we are together, taking the first steps towards ending this national nightmare,” Webb says
Ex-Denver Mayor Webb is up now and someone in the crowd quips “is Romer next?” (That’s a former co gov)
State Rep Tom Sullivan, whose kid was killed in the aurora theater shooting, drawing the biggest cheers for saying “John and I fought the NRA!” (To pass universal background checks)

Update: It’s getting cold
Self-described “Colorado dirt farmer” Keith Bath recalls how Hick urged people to commit “random acts of kindness.”		“That’s the kind of president we need, someone who lifts us up, who brings people together.”

@JMtweets40 That's not an easy message. "Sham vote" is procedural, which usually doesn't work in messaging.

Hickenlooper notes that his divergence from the rest of the D field on marijuana shows he doesn’t push policies for political gain. Noted that as gov of 1st marijuana legalizing state he could have gotten a lot of financial and popular support for going full legalization.
Asked about marijuana, of course, Hickenlooper reiterated his view that states should be able to decide whether to legalize. He opposes national legalization, though says it shouldn’t be classified as a Schedule 1 drug anymore.

Hickenlooper calls Israel one of our greatest allies, says he backs a two-state solution but says he can’t say whether Rep Omar is right that it has outsized role in US fgpol because he’s not in DC.
He says we have reached a tipping point on climate change where public realizes urgency and it’s time to pivot hard to clean energy. Suggests big investments in weatherization, etc. does not mention GND.
Other takeaways — he speaks emotionally about helping Central American economies to cut down issues at the border. Calls a wall “a political vanity project.”
Hickenlooper says he’s pro-filibuster. Calls it a safety valve, although he admits some days he wants to junk it.

@JMtweets40 This is hair splitting
@JMtweets40 No of course not. But that a temp spike that roughly tracks emissions for the past 100 years is useful data that points in one direction.
@JMtweets40 No my point is you want to watch a post industrial revolution timeline (esp post automobile/electrification). That’s close to 100 years.
@JMtweets40 If a climate change is caused by human-generated emissions then long term is 100 years or so — the entire sample of when those emissions have been generated at a consistent level
@JMtweets40 Not if they’re caused by human-generated emissions!
@JMtweets40 Yes but again the long term trend is pretty clear esp in polar areas
@JMtweets40 My point last mth was that isolated temp swings aren’t what we should pay attention to.		My point today is Alaska has been warming steadily for years and just took another big jump over the past month and none of that is good.

Hick’s first interview as a presidential candidate https://t.co/aTYX5APJMQ
Stylistically Hickenlooper is a moderate but he did move Colorado left, with gun control, Medicaid expansion and some limits on emissions. He became governor when the state was truly purple. But it’s now pretty solidly Democratic and moving faster left w/out him.
RT @JonLemire: Today in the Democratic field: Hickenlooper in, Holder out https://t.co/bwUDXbrwrt
Hickenlooper is a centrist sort who dislikes partisan politics who now promises to achieve liberal goals in DC. Obvious question is whether D primary voters go for that from a 66-year-old white guy.

@BenjySarlin she asked questions like a journalist!
Michael Cohen describes someone as a "Ukranian oligarch."
AOC was a good, brisk questioner. Ayanna Pressley started by giving a long speech about truth and justice, eating into her time for questions.
That said, if we had a dime for "this is the end of Trump"....
Was talking to a bunch of Ds this week who were very bullish that Trump would be wounded by these oversight hearings and investigations. Seems more plausible today.
The news coming out of this hearing! Cohen says Trump inflated the value of his holdings to insurance companies.
AOC talking New Yorker speed
This https://t.co/NDkMRkHlG2
Significantly, Cohen doesn't think Trump is being audited, which is the reason the president has said he won't release his returns.
Why did Trump not want to release his returns? Cohen says: "He didn't want an entire group of think tanks, who are tax experts, run through his returns." Afraid he'd eventually be audited, Cohen says.

@CahnEmily he didn't say who the target was, just that the last convo was part of an ongoing investigation

@RealFacelessMan @Billbrowder I don't dismiss that somewhere out there is a freelancer who could have been paid. I do come pretty close to dismissing out of hand that an established reporter was paid to do a story of this nature absent extraordinarily strong evidence.
@RealFacelessMan Also, from a business perspective, there's no need to pay journalists to write a competitive story because they get professional rewards from doing so (promotions, new jobs, tv gigs etc). So it doesn't make sense that a firm, esp one run by ex-journos, would spend its $ doing so.

Why the sun belt/rust belt debate isn't really an either/or choice ---&gt; https://t.co/L7WFYIRZZv
@EdAsante77 Correct. A Stacey Abrams sort of candidate may have lost AZ handily last cycle (the D gov candidate isn't a fair comparison because he was a bad candidate)
@EdAsante77 My main issue with this debate is it's not like you can only win one slice or another. If Trump wins NC he's probably got a good shot at PA. Ditto the reverse for Ds

@EdAsante77 I know it’s not a crazy assessment see my TS but we don’t know if this will keep up. I’m just trying to push back on all definitive statements though inevitably I’ll make one tomorrow
@EdAsante77 Hard to evaluate
TBC this is complete speculation. We’re so far out there no real way to predict what’s going to happen. But I get the sense that at least the Twitter cognoscenti are a bit more bearish on Bernie than merited rn.
Finally there’s a lot of data showing Ds don’t necessarily want to go hard left, they just want to win. But in this sense they may be like 2016 Rs, who embraced the leading candidate because they were hungry for a winner.
In 2016 this wasn’t an impediment to the well-financed Clinton but you can see a 2020 world where none of the D field hits consistent Sanders-level numbers as they swap front runner (or Sanders alternative) status as Rs did in 2016.
Trump is very good at making news and drowned out rivals with tons of earned media. Sanders’ uber-disciplined stump style wont draw that but today’s haul shows he could drown rivals via fundraising.
After all, Trump got ahead in 2016 because he consolidated a very loyal plurality in a very divided R primary field. Sanders meanwhile was in a 1-on-1 race in 16 but the D 2020 nominee could be someone with support of a minority of D primary voters.
Random speculation 12 months out: Some drew parallels between Sanders and Trump’s insurgent bids in 2016 but what if the real parallel is Sanders 2020 and Trump 2016?

@RealFacelessMan I come back to the opening of that RAND study, that this is complicated enough we may never know for sure but seems logical that given preponderance of evidence it should be in policy discussion.

@RealFacelessMan ie that if someone doesn't have access to a gun they choose an equally effective method of completing suicide. Since guns are so effective hard to picture a good substitute (and of course I can't imagine how you'd study it).
@RealFacelessMan Access to firearms increases suicide rates. https://t.co/I5Yq5E3Gly https://t.co/4btgqQh5jx	https://t.co/1NOYroSoKZ	So fewer guns, US probably has lower suicide rate than its peers, which is a good thing.	I haven't seen evidence of a substitution effect (cont'd)

RT @conorsen: Long centrism, short AOC is a good trade right now.

None of this is to say GND couldn’t complicate life for Ds but cows, planes and automobiles may not be the way.

@maazurka @swin24 That may well be true but here they express a desire to wind down a zero-carbon source of electricity. Just speaks to the political tension here.
Discussing the weather forecasts for various candidate announcement events this weekend in Slack and concluding that more Californians need to run.
Anyway there's a clear three-way tension -- the desire for big govt populism vs the need to do something that will significantly reduce carbon emissions vs traditional environmentalist views (ie nuclear is bad)
Also obviously the rejection of nuclear -- an energy source which emits zero carbon and is in place already generating a lot of power.
What's particularly interesting is its rejection of market forces that experts think would be most potent in stopping climate change -- which may be a smart political judgment (see France, Brazil etc).

@NateSilver538 @BenjySarlin Honestly the only way it could have helped him is w the white non college who gave him his EC edge and we won't have a good test of that until the reelect. But issues are usually overrated as factors in political races -- esp nowadays. That is my general bugaboo.
@NateSilver538 @BenjySarlin We really can’t debate conditionals — what if Trump beat Biden, for example? We can say that immigration didn’t prove fatal in the general which, again, is a significant change from where people were before 2016.
@NateSilver538 @BenjySarlin It helped him win GOP primary and was less of an impediment to a general election win than the CW held (or than polls like this would suggest)
@BenjySarlin @ThePlumLineGS Yes I would agree with the important caveat that a hardline immigration stance proved not as costly with a more purportedly pro-immigration general electorate as advertised.
@BenjySarlin @ThePlumLineGS Right I’m not casting aspersions on the polls themselves just noting that they are very much not predictive of what voters will do on an issue. In fact, you can argue voter behavior is a better guide to where the public stands than polling sometimes.

@HotlineJosh It will happen. You have a quality franchise rather than a perennial dumpster fire + deGrom and Thor
@HotlineJosh See this is the difference between a Nats fan and a Mets fan. I'm never optimistic.
@HotlineJosh (skeptical it'd play out that way even w a more "unifying" potus)
@HotlineJosh Maybe we will have a chance to find out but I am quite skeptical even if we did.
@beardedcrank @HotlineJosh Sure thats the calculation the left makes on the filibuster
@HotlineJosh I hope you're right but not sure you are. Cj reform is the exception that proves the rule -- if Trump had not embraced it, it's at 47%.
@HotlineJosh Nothing is broadly popular anymore because one political actor embraces it and the other side instantly rejects it.
@HotlineJosh Obviously they could only abolish it with 50 or more votes in the senate. Imagine they'll whip that bridge when they come to it.
@beardedcrank @HotlineJosh My guess is Josh would point out that the senate repeal bill was politically unpalatable because it had to comply with reconciliation rules, and they could have won one of the skeptics w no filibuster. Unknowable but not crazy.
@HotlineJosh Yes but to circle back to where this began, this isn't the left admitting their agenda is unpopular. It is them saying, probably correctly, that we will never see 60 votes for anything again in the US Senate and they think their programs will be harder to unwind than the right's.

@tombellin @Alex_Roarty @chrisFnicholson Right, this would cancel all private insurance plans.

@chrisFnicholson @Alex_Roarty @tombellin Yes I get it but the revenue raisers would be an explicit part of the discussion here -- whatever they fund it with would have to be very broad based and sold with the argument that it's lowering overall out of pocket health costs.
@chrisFnicholson @Alex_Roarty @tombellin It wouldn't be free. There'd have to be taxes in there somewhere. That'd have to be part of the sale -- "there's a tax increase but you'll be paying less than you would for private health care"
@Alex_Roarty @chrisFnicholson @tombellin Waaaay bigger than those two. Plus you wouldn't just lose your insurance but access to your doctor. A lot of factors here.

@bricey16 Let’s see. That’s the point of this. Let’s see rather than assume we know precisely what’s gonna happen. Anytime a billionaire floats a presidential run (at least the 1st time) it’s pretty newsworthy
@NateSilver538 Not sure I agree. Life isn’t fair and the fact that he has these resources means he’s bigger news than your average bear.
@nycsouthpaw There’s a big difference between Trump and Schultz at this point in their respective races. Trump wasn’t covered when he was floating a run, only when he announced. Because he wasn’t taken seriously due to past behavior.
@GMSarli He gives populist candidates a new target to lump in w Trump and potentially complicates more moderate lanes (“you sound like Howard Schultz.”)
@bababoosh Anyone who spends tens of millions/hundreds of millions on a presidential race usually has an impact
@bricey16 “I’m running against the billionaires” becomes an actual argument.
@NateSilver538 It seems a little backward to argue you don’t cover billionaires because they’re not polling well before they decide to run. I’m conversant w the literature on 3rd party “spoilers” and how they often don’t spoil but this seems like news.
