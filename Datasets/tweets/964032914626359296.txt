Pres. Obama talking about how the greatest feat of strength is not knocking somebody else down but using your strength to lift others up was very inspiring and it‚Äôs a lesson I wish I had learned a long time ago. We don‚Äôt need to prove ourselves by making weaker men look weaker.
@KaivanShroff Here‚Äôs what I think- Runcie is a horrible human being who is horrible at his job and the color of his skin has nothing to do with it.
@red8jwoe Runcie is awful and people will call you racist for thinking that for some reason
@KaivanShroff You know, I think one can think somebody is completely incapable of doing a job that involves the safety of children without caring about their race.

Young men aren‚Äôt ‚Äúsoft‚Äù or immasculine for struggling with depression and anxiety. 		Young women deal with real issues that cannot be shrugged off because they‚Äôre ‚Äújust teenage girls, and teenage girls get emotional all the time.‚Äù		Those notions are total bullshit.
Mental health is going to be the defining issue for my generation and we need to tackle it.		Do not tell others that their problems are invalid because others have it worse. Do not tell others it‚Äôs ‚Äújust a phase.‚Äù		End the stigma around opening up about what you‚Äôre going through.

@becongress I had no desire to do that
At first I was perfectly comfortable with it as I was deeply focused on getting the undeniably crucial gun control message across, but with time I‚Äôve gained some new perspective and I think it was wrong of me to accept those labels.
Please do not call me a ‚Äúvictim‚Äù or ‚Äúsurvivor‚Äù of a mass shooting. I was 100+ yards away from the gunfire. There are kids who had to climb over dead bodies. In my opinion, calling me a victim or witness or survivor diminishes what they went through. I was completely safe.

Again, let me make this abundantly clear:		No matter who you are or what you look like, we are all human beings and we must put aside our differences and fight the strengthening forces of hate together. This is why I try to build bridges with those who oppose my views.
Also, stop letting Farrakhan speak at your events. As one of the ‚Äútermites‚Äù he attacks with his words, I can tell you that anti-semitism is pure evil. 		We are the UNITED States, no matter what anybody says. We must unite against those who attack our people.
I‚Äôm not a fan of a lot of the media‚Äôs activity or portrayal of many things, but I call on the President to take a stronger stance against hate than he does against the media. 		We‚Äôve seen a 57% increase of anti-Semitic attacks this year. Combatting this is a non-partisan issue.

This Sunday, the @dailywire is releasing an on-tape sitdown I did with @BenShapiro. I agreed to sit with him because he is often regarded as an expert on gun related topics and youth activism and I felt it was my job to hear out someone who  understands and knows the other side.
Sitting down with someone who you disagree with also allows one‚Äôs self to hear the best of the other side and strengthen one‚Äôs drive for change  and helps create educated youth leaders. Knowing the other side of the argument is crucial to engaging with others and creating change.

Look, this thread is uncoordinated, reactionary, and emotional. But we need to step up. We need to tackle this issue for what it is and treat it with the urgency it requires.
You have no reason to touch somebody inappropriately without consent. You have no reason to let anybody else do it. 		Consent is a very simple thing. If for one second you question whether or not it is consensual, you are doing something wrong.
I‚Äôve heard things along the lines of ‚ÄúShe was asking for it‚Äù or ‚ÄúI was drunk,‚Äù and a slew of other completely ridiculous ideas. Wave one of Gen Z is coming into adulthood. We need to do better this time.
Turning in for the night, but one thing has been killing me for a while now:		Fellow 17 year-old boys (and all young men/men everywhere,)		We have a responsibility to create a new, better moral fabric. Rape is not okay, it will never be okay, and there are NO excuses.
We need to do better. Our country needs to focus on improving every day. Yes, the past is filled with atrocious acts that have gone unpunished &amp; unnoticed. We can not use this to justify it. We must learn from the past &amp; create a future where evil is punished and not shrugged off
It really sickens me to have to worry about raising my future children into a world where people try and justify rape. No matter who did it, no matter when, rape is a disgusting, inhuman act and must be treated as nothing less.

Whether or not you agree with his stance on gun control, Fred was trying to talk to Kavanaugh. This was not some organized plan to make him look bad.
People who think that @fred_guttenberg‚Äôs attempt to shake Kavanaugh‚Äôs hand was ‚Äòplanned by Feinstein‚Äô are people who don‚Äôt know him. Fred is a man who introduces himself to people and appreciates honest discussion. Thinking this was some sort of scheme is preposterous.

More mass shootings occurred last night in California and Alabama.		As hard as it is for me to see this news, it is even harder to think about how many more will happen this week alone.		Nobody in our country should be shot. The epidemic that is gun violence is only growing.

@andymientus Great thread. Very well-put
@RyanHillMI I am more than comfortable calling white supremacists out for being white supremacists. These people are still at it and their terrible ideals cannot be ignored.
Examples: Russell Walker, Arthur Jones, Corey Stewart, John Fitzgerald, etc.
It is truly remarkable how right-wing propagandists like Candace Owens will call Democrats racist, citing the 1800‚Äôs, while I‚Äôm pretty sure that the only admitted white supremacists running for office in recent years have had a big (R) next to their name...

School shooters can NOT be treated like celebrities. I don‚Äôt want to hear their names or see their faces. Nobody does.
If the media is going to circulate photos or videos of school shooters, they NEED TO START ADDING WARNINGS. There are people (like me) who are truly shaken by looking at the shooter and using their names and images creates the notoriety that many of them seek.

Seeing my teachers in the following days was such a relief. I didn‚Äôt know if they were okay for a long time, and I never thought I‚Äôd be that happy to see the people who assign me homework. Many of the teachers were so strong and really helped us through this in amazing ways.
One of the most important people in my life slept through everything- she doesn‚Äôt go to Douglas and she was on medicine from a procedure she had earlier. She had to wake up and see our world completely torn apart. It reminds you how quickly all this horror was brought about.
The fact that I wasn‚Äôt near @al3xw1nd was one of the scariest things. He was closer than I was. I didn‚Äôt know if he was okay- he wasn‚Äôt on his phone. I couldn‚Äôt imagine having to lose him without having said goodbye
Also, seeing @JaclynCorin in the room made me feel a lot better. She was quite visibly upset and as scared as I was, but she was there. And when Jackie is near me, even the worst things ever are just a little bit better. So glad to have her by my side
Two months later, I still remember sitting in class joking around with Scott Beigel.		For those of you who don‚Äôt know, Scott was a teacher.		He was also a friend. A really, really, funny one. And his sense of humor was super dry, too. Very Arrested Development. I miss you Scott.
Two months ago, I texted my parents that I was with my little brother and we were safe. I didn‚Äôt know if that last part was true. My brother didn‚Äôt know what was going on. He has special needs and all he knew was that something was wrong. I‚Äôm infinitely grateful that he‚Äôs alive. https://t.co/FxUoRJYrVC

Nope! But for the one vote I can‚Äôt cast, I‚Äôll have thousands voting for the ideals I stand for.		To other people my age who can‚Äôt vote yet- talk to your parents, talk to people who can vote.

Great meeting today with the team about our structure moving forward.		A large demographic of people that haven‚Äôt been voting are about to show up at the polls and there will be some MAJOR changes coming.		Represent us or get kicked out. The midterms are going to be monumental.

And I mean it. I think responsible ownership of a small weapon is not something that should be revoked. It should be much more difficult to get a gun than a car and there should be frequent psychological checkups, but some weapons can protect a home. Assault weapons are not those
