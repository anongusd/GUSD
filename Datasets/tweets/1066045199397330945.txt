@TfreddyTina @rachbarnhart @news10nbc @JeremyKappell Lmao! So king and junior make coon? I heard the truth. Nobody should have that word on the tip of their tongue. Why cant you understand that its offensive to me? And you need to stop acting like you definitively know what he meant to say.
@mbstra @news10nbc @JeremyKappell Again why is coon even in his vocabulary? It not in mine and I'm hoping it's not in yours
@ladydnyse @bosayles @JeremyKappell How can you even compare the two? This man accidentally said coon! Why is that word in his mind at all? He didnt say it when talking about the weather for the weekend . Stop it with the bull
@bosayles @JeremyKappell Why is the word coon in his vocabulary? Why would it be on his mind?
@TfreddyTina @ByCharlieRicker @mbstra @Aqgolfer9 @rachbarnhart @news10nbc @JeremyKappell Why is "coon" in his vocabulary! What made saying mlk Jr bring this out of him? These are questions that must be answered! Again Coon and king are not similar
@mbstra @news10nbc @JeremyKappell A racist motive? He replaced king with coon! Yes blame the black people for being offended. what other context do I need? Where does coon come from in his mind? I'm sure he is nice to all the people around him but that doesn't have anything to with how he feels about mlk.
@TfreddyTina @ByCharlieRicker @mbstra @Aqgolfer9 @rachbarnhart @news10nbc @JeremyKappell I'm was born and raised near Corn hill and this is shameful. No excuse and the Mayor has every right to chime in. "Coon" and "king" are not similar. That is not something you accidentally say.

This was one of the reasons it was illegal to read for blacks. Also y jim crow was put in place after reconstruction because the idea of equal opportunity was fearful for most whites.
@michcusejoe5 @sahilkapur On 9/11 and Medicare prescription giveaway while decreasing revenue for a large war time tax cut. But I appreciate the perspective it's not just stupid talking points that most Trump voters say. Oh and that total collapse of the economy in 2007. Just kidding kind of. Lol
@michcusejoe5 @sahilkapur Well im sorry for the ignorant comment. But contexts does matter. The Soviets were inevitably going to collapse so doubling the debt for the military was unnecessary. Clinton ran on the budget and wellfare reform just made the surplus larger it did not create it. Bush spent...

It's like shaq but quicker https://t.co/Ba5HMJsIEQ
@michcusejoe5 @sahilkapur The point is that all presidents increase the debt. The difference is the annual deficit added to the overall national debt. How can you be so ignorant? Both Clinton and Obama left office with the deficit decreasing. Republicans since Reagan have done the opposite.
@thedingo8 @sahilkapur How is this spin? Nothing but facts. Do you even know the difference between debt and deficits? Lol
@midwestmalcolm @sahilkapur Yes and Republicans cut taxes therfore reducing revenue while still increasing spending thus the rise of the deficit. Get it? Lol
@WatsonDanielLSU @sahilkapur Most Republicans are to ignorant to know the difference between the debt and deficit
Yep that's what Republicans do really starting with Reagan. It's a shame that most of the media feeds into their lies. https://t.co/yuQm1nwcu0
@MackinLord @JesseJinkins @ComptonTx @dagreatscienski @QueenA91567967 @RealCandaceO And @JesseJinkins I thought that America finally honored the words in the Constitution that all men are created equal? You seem to think like typical racist do that somehow rights are based on how whites view us. The fear of us.
@MackinLord @JesseJinkins @ComptonTx @dagreatscienski @QueenA91567967 @RealCandaceO That's y I asked about the wealth gap because I want to expose their racism. Y is it so hard for Rep to admit that wealth and opportunity was stolen from blacks for hundreds of years? And that is mostly the cause for the wealth gap. Admitting does not make them bad people.
@MackinLord @JesseJinkins @ComptonTx @dagreatscienski @QueenA91567967 @RealCandaceO That tweet by @JesseJinkins was completely racist. This is what I'm speaking on. You dont get that racist will always find faults. You dont get that blacks have worked hard forever and to this day to improve our community. I dont need validation from them. Just what is owed.

@MackinLord @ComptonTx @dagreatscienski @JesseJinkins @QueenA91567967 @RealCandaceO More excuses for ignorant racist comments. Misinformed huh? All people can do better not just blacks. American culture glorifies "ballin". Its not a black thing. Again I'm talking about the accumalation of wealth! With that comes opportunities and second and third chances...
Why do so many Republicans believe that "culture" is the reason for the wealth gap in this country between whites and blacks? https://t.co/vW3YWVjgMl

I want you to acknowledge that blacks have for most of USA history not been able to do this. With that come to the obvious conclusion that this is the cause of the gap. Not "culture"
@QueenA91567967 @MackinLord @ComptonTx @dagreatscienski @JesseJinkins @RealCandaceO Telling blacks that their "culture" is the reason for a generational wealth gap like this is racist. He should stop being worried about how racist he is and just not be racist and speaking in stereotypes. Blacks work hard blacks are smart but y the gap? Oh it's that "culture" https://t.co/1bRxPHaNCj

@ComptonTx @dagreatscienski @JesseJinkins @QueenA91567967 @MackinLord @RealCandaceO It's not a crutch its history and facts. It's always the same with racist.

@gerell03 @GOP @realDonaldTrump But not because he ever wanted to good for the black community
@gerell03 @GOP @realDonaldTrump Trump has never been a fabric of hip hop. He is and was a braggadcious millionaire from NYC. Rappers wanted to be him without knowing anything about what he thought about the civil rights act for example. Every ny base rapper had him in his rhymes in the late 80s early 90s.
@gerell03 @GOP @realDonaldTrump I think the President of the Unites States calling most Dem politicians stupid and dumb is a bigger problem than Snoop saying fuck Trump. For god sakes he should lead all of America not just the ones who voted for him.
@gerell03 @GOP @realDonaldTrump Again why talk to him? Why bow down? If Trump truly wanted to being this country together he would be doing the outreach even privately. To see what the black community truly needs. T knows his base are racist and he must keep that tension. Wish he could but hes not a good man.
@gerell03 @GOP @realDonaldTrump You say ourselves but Kap is part of that us. Kanye is a narcissist just like Trump and that's why he went. If you dont bow down to Trump he just calls u names. I hope he had a  positive influence but he is being used by W supremacist to put down blacks. Cant rock with that.
@gerell03 @GOP @realDonaldTrump Listen when you give up your profession for what you believe in that should be respected. He gives millions to help black men throughout the country. He put the issue on the front pages. No one man can save us all. MLK was the greatest American ever but he couldn't fix the USA.
@gerell03 @GOP @realDonaldTrump Democrats will pass a much better bill in the house next year that he wont even think of supporting. Maybe we shouldnt have for profit prisons or marijuana being illegal and giving young black men records. Democrats will fight for those things and that's why I'm a Democrat.
@gerell03 @GOP @realDonaldTrump Again Trump only wants praise for bringing in black people. When Kapernick speaks about issues like no jobs and violent policing he calls him names. Why? Because most white people love it. The bill has not been passed. Not even close. But I believe it's a modest proposal but ...
@gerell03 @GOP @realDonaldTrump And you have a great point about time but Unfortunately that's how powerful white supremacy is. How all these poor white folks voting against universal healthcare or $15 minimum wage? Because it might help black people that's why.
@gerell03 @GOP @realDonaldTrump It's a binary choice. We have to choose. We have to fight evil. I dont love Democrats. I didnt love Hillary but she would have allowed black ideas and voices in. Trump just wants glory for himself.
@gerell03 @GOP @realDonaldTrump But thinking that you can support a racist clown like Trump for the betterment of your familys future is just sad
@gerell03 @GOP @realDonaldTrump Good luck with that. But I would suggest not  give up because of the structural racism this country was created from. Listen things have gotten better. Go talk to your grandmother about what she faced and what are children face. Big difference.

@gerell03 @GOP @realDonaldTrump No research necessary i am aware of it. I was originally talking about the 60 million people who voted for Hillary. Next your gonna talk about super predators

@IamGMJohnson I am all for human rights of all kinds. Gay straight and trans. I think some people on my side are just to harsh on this topic. No one is for violence against anyone. Anyone should live their own sexuality. But I do believe you need to be honest. DH is being clowned for his lies.
@gerell03 @GOP @realDonaldTrump Lol yes he was the only president to try to change that. Obama would have signed any bill like the one being proposed. But for some reason Republicans didnt want to work with him on anything. Oh and Hilary wasnt in elected office on the 1990s
@thehill This country is so racist. You have homegrown white men murdering in the bunches but brown people are supposed to be scared of other brown people. Smh

@cnni Stop trying to bring your cult to everyone and focus on your own relationship with god.
@Reuters Looks like 2007 all over again
@GOP @realDonaldTrump Maybe he should stop putting down the 60 million people who voted for Clinton. Also about a hundred other things
