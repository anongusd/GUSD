@TankSchottle Good night Tank. Happy dreams.
Great question! Also, why is it that women's shampoo &amp; conditioner bottles are equal size? One bottle of conditioner can last through at least four bottles of shampoo. https://t.co/gArdcW6Dmz

I rest my case! You only listen to @FoxNews The Democrats are doing their jobs, providing oversight! We are a democracy, not a dictatorship!

No, Donald! It's only fake if they say anything negative about you. @TuckerCarlson @seanhannity &amp; @FoxNews spout only what YOU want, not what is real, fair &amp; balanced.

Another pathetic cry! You did NOT win the popular vote; @HillaryClinton did. There are too many of us that did NOT vote for you &amp; if the 2018 mid-terms didn't show you that, then I guess you will remain delusional. #TheResistance #VoteThemOut #FakePresident #BlueWave2020 https://t.co/zLInRP44bT

Let's hear what you would propose Lindsey. It is in no way the fault of the Democrats that Chairman Kim won't work w/anyone. Your question alone, places the blame on us, shifting the reality that @realDonaldTrump isn't able to do what any other president has failed to do. https://t.co/FGBie7iMzt
He hasn't done anything differently except to praise Chairman Kim as if he were a God. N.Korea will not work with anyone. They continue to do what we do, protect their country. Why would they trust @realDonaldTrump? He has alienated our allies &amp; LIES non-stop. #TheResistance https://t.co/tKrQx0Dxy6
This is NOT a great article! Your sources are mouthing what @realDonaldTrump wants them to say, in order to keep a promise that was a LIE to begin with! Try another strategy Lindsey.

@sianoresist I am personally disgusted that Trump publicly stated he believes Chairman Kim regarding the death of our college student. Again w/ the death of the journalist in Saudia Arabia. How can anyone support not only Trump, but the Republican party as well?
@LgbtResistance I am going through the same thing &amp; I am miserable.
@GOP @LindseyGrahamSC @senatemajldr @Jim_Jordan @ChuckGrassley @SenateGOP @HouseGOP Let's put aside defending @realDonaldTrump from @MichaelCohen212 Can any of you tell me you are okay w/Trump's dismissal of the torture &amp; murder of two people at the hands of dictators?
Happy for you'll, no collusion that @MichaelCohen212 is aware of! Doesn't mean there is no evidence, so quit feeling so al' mighty! All of you will pay for supporting this mobster cockroach! #TheResistance #VoteThemOut #BlueWave2020 #MakeAmericaAmericaAgain https://t.co/5wq8NYEL2H

Why does he continue to get away w/risking the safety of all Americans? I am sick of no one standing up to this man! Kelly writes a memo indicating he was against Jared Kushner being given a clearance! What the hell? How is that helping any of us? May God help us all! https://t.co/Y0IQ4eTUOj
@realDonaldTrump How dare you LIE to us about @jaredkushner &amp; your ordering Kelly to give him a top security clearance. You, Jared &amp; @IvankaTrump whom also lied, are putting my children &amp; grandchildren at risk! @GOP is accountable too! #TheResistance #VoteThemOut #BlueWave2020
@seanhannity Excuse me Sean, you &amp; @FoxNews is the fake news, not @CNN @MSNBC or any other respectable news channel. Your station is Trump's propaganda filter! Have a nice show!

OMG, get over this for goodness sakes. Michael was ready, willing &amp; able to testify earlier, but @realDonaldTrump had to go &amp; threaten him &amp; his family, so Cohen's testimony was delayed. It's unfortunate that DT Isn't here, but would that have really mattered? https://t.co/7Ow2NJ1Cc4

@therealroseanne Wow! I really enjoyed your show when you didn't bring politics into it.

I want to plead to all of our @SenateGOP &amp; our @HouseGOP as well as @LindseyGrahamSC @senatemajldr Pls strongly consider Tuesday's vote. Many of us Democrats do not want socialism to any degree. But, neither do we want an Authoritarian gov't which is what @realDonaldTrump wants.
Bullshit illusion! You, @realDonaldTrump have done so many wrong, illegal &amp; morally wrong, that you can't distinguish right from wrong. When you said yesterday, "I think I talk very nice," you don't even see anything wrong! You are a liar, a cheat and a disgusting human being. https://t.co/Gx2GAhDFB9
