We encourage you to sign up for important emails and updates about the #ACA at http://t.co/WVmLpcuoff #PHAN13
It:a 11:11... What's your #healthcare wish? :) #PHAN13
Important: insurance companies will still be able to sell policies outside of the Marketplace. We'll help you access GOOD info! #PHAN13
Great resource from @KaiserFamFound to help estimate what your tax credit will be: http://t.co/GELQV8tiE8 #GetCovered today! #ACA #PHAN13
In #Pennsylvania, almost 750,000 people will be eligible for new tax credits to help pay for their #healthinsurance. #ACA #PHAN13
Did you know? Members of congress will be shopping for health insurance in the #marketplace, too. #GetCovered #PHAN13
Under #ACA, at least 80% of premium dollars that insurance companies receive must go directly to care. #PHAN13
"The most important thing to @BarackObama right now is the complete and successful implementation of the #ACA" - @AntonJGunn #PHAN13
We will see a major public ed. campaign starting Oct. 1 online, via radio, on TV, and on social media - @AntonJGunn #PHAN13
Navigators may be intimidated by #ACA opponents. We need to help them do their jobs. #PHAN13
Now in a Q&amp;A session with @AntonJGunn http://t.co/p97XG59jwL
Great goal from @AntonJGunn: no one in his country should know what "uninsured" means.
A humbling moment: @AntonJGunn reminds us that open enrollment will not be perfect. We will need to keep engaging &amp; giving feedback #PHAN13
"Beginning January 1, no one in this country will be denied coverage because of a pre-existing condition." -@AntonJGunn #PHAN13
...and the 24-hour phone line has been expanding capacity, too! 1-800-318-2596 #PHAN13
Prediction from @AntonJGunn: ~60% of people who will enroll in new plans will do so online at http://t.co/WVmLpcuoff #PHAN13
Further now than we ever have been in this country re: health care coverage for Americans - @AntonJGunn #PHAN13
