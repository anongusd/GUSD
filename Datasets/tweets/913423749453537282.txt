@JerryFalwellJr God bless you sir. The Left are always attacking @realDonaldTrump but it’s only because he’s lazy, dumb, a criminal, an adulterer, a traitor, a racist, a liar and a cheat. It’s wonderful that you are able to see past these tiny character flaws.
@DonaldJTrumpJr Good to see you are enjoying your last couple of months outside of Jail.
@RepAndyBiggsAZ @POTUS @realDonaldTrump Your support for the Russian asset in the @Whitehouse will not be forgotten.
@realDonaldTrump Thanks, Traitor. I’ll definitely take your advice on which of your criminal associates I should believe.
@realDonaldTrump Dementia is sad. Find help.
@realDonaldTrump 11.30 - Early start for you this morning, Fatso
@charliekirk11 https://t.co/RK1qORgFc3
@senrobportman @SenateFloor Trump is too WEAK, too FRIGHTENED or too LAZY to stand up to Kim Jong Un, or Putin. 		America deserves a better president than this.
@RepBillFlores The NRA and President Putin thank you for your support, tovarisch
@GOP @IvankaTrump Completely unqualified member of a crime family says what?
@GOP @GOPChairwoman Values such as:	* supporting a criminal @POTUS who repeatedly cheated on his wife	* keeping a Russian asset in the @whitehouse	* taking @NRA money and failing to prevent gun deaths
@RepChipRoy Speaking of high schools, why did Trump threaten to sue his old school if they ever revealed his grades?		Could it be because he's been a MORON and a FAILURE since school?
@WhiteHouse Trump's rambling, incoherent mutterings about the murder of Otto Warmbier were disgusting		Has this man no decency?		And why is he so consistently eager to believe the word of tinpot dictators over the US intelligence community?
@PressSec @realDonaldTrump The way Trump has been walked over by world leaders has been a constant surprise to me. 		We knew he'd lie. We knew he was dumb. We knew he was lazy. 		But did anyone think he'd be such a pathetic fucking candy ass on the international stage?
@funder The way Trump has been walked over by world leaders has been a constant surprise to me. 		We knew he'd lie. We knew he was dumb. We knew he was lazy. 		But did anyone think he'd be such a fucking candy ass on the international stage?
@SenJoniErnst Here's a crazy idea: Should we talk to our economic/foreign policy experts, and then get an experienced negotiator to go talk with China? 		Nah, let's send Fatso again after he's spent the morning watching TV and playing on his phone. That's working out brilliantly with NK

@realDonaldTrump Meeting cancelled. No result, even after Trump caved on NK demands re monitoring. What happened?	A. Trump as shit at negotiating as he was at running a business 	B. Trump too lazy, just decided he’d rather go golfing	C. Trump realised it wasn’t distracting from #Cohen so no point

@dbongino @DonaldJTrumpJr The #Cohen testimony is a thousand times more interesting than what the bloated lazy POTUS is doing with Korea or Vietnam or whatever the hell he’s doing.
@senrobportman @SenatorCarper No one cares		We’re all watching the #Cohen testimony and finding out what a piece of scum POTUS we’ve accidentally elected.
@GOPChairwoman @realDonaldTrump This Cohen testimony is fantastic viewing	Like watching a feral rat chew the heads off other (slightly dumber) feral rats.
@bynsny @realDonaldTrump Trump taking LAZY to whole new levels...	Does nothing but watch TV and poke at his phone until 11AM, and now too lazy to even write new tweets!
@realDonaldTrump Cohen will put you in jail. Hilarious!
@GovMikeHuckabee @realDonaldTrump Cohen will put the whole Trump family in jail. Hilarious!
@RepMarkMeadows Complaining about irrelevant details of evidence presented is a common tactic of defence lawyers. Especially those with guilty clients. But hey, you do you.
@EricTrump ‘Only the best people’ right?		Cohen is going to put the whole Trump family in jail.
@WhiteHouse @realDonaldTrump No-one cares		We’re all watching the #Cohen testimony
@newtgingrich We are impressed 		The #Cohen testimony is the most fascinating thing happening right now. I’m not surprised you’re also riveted.
@ericgeller @MarkLeibovich @chashomans To paraphrase an old saying: even an overweight, lazy, unqualified, disinterested clock tells the right time twice a day
Which means @DonaldJTrumpJr is going to jail for perjury		I wonder if Pops will even notice? https://t.co/6a350QsmWu
@marcorubio Trump is a moron and a Russian asset. Of course it will be a disaster. Kim Jong Un will play him like a fiddle.
@DonaldJTrumpJr Pops is a moron
@RepGosar @POTUS @thehill Too busy reading #Cohen testimony, sorry

@realDonaldTrump Hey dummy: Why did you threaten your high school, your colleges, and the College Board to never release your grades or SAT scores? 		Is it because you're really, really, really, really fucking stupid?
@realDonaldTrump Hey dummy: Why did you threaten your high school, your colleges, and the College Board to never release your grades or SAT scores? 		Is it because you're really, really thick?
@SecPompeo @realDonaldTrump We don't care		We're all reading about the #Cohen testimony		Hey but here's a question: Why did Trump threaten his high school, his colleges, and the College Board to never release his grades or SAT scores? Is it because he's as thick as pigshit?
@marcorubio Your boss is a Russian asset		Do something about it
@Scavino45 We don't care		We're all reading about the #Cohen testimony		Question: Why did Trump threaten his high school, his colleges, and the College Board to never release his grades or SAT scores? Is it because he's as thick as pigshit?
@WhiteHouse @realDonaldTrump Earlier today class dunce @realDonaldTrump met with President Trong, a moderately clever dictator. Trump is now being played by Chairman Kim Jong Un, a mental midget.
@newtgingrich Why did Trump threaten his high school, his colleges, and the College Board to never release his grades or SAT scores?		Is it because he's as thick as pigshit?
@WhiteHouse His followers must be so proud to see their leader with this tin-pot dictator		Republicans are probably unhappy about it too.

@SenAlexander If that Dem POTUS had been a Russian asset, I would have hoped those Dem Senators would have acted to remove them		So why aren't you doing the same?		Your support for the Russian asset in the WH will not be remembered well in history.

@newtgingrich @seanhannity @realDonaldTrump @FoxNews Or, Trump is there to ask Kim JU for asylum, because he knows his crimes are about to be revealed by #Cohen and #Mueller this week
@realDonaldTrump Hey Fatso, are you asking your new friend Kim for asylum because you know your crimes are going to be revealed by #Cohen and #Mueller this week?
@realDonaldTrump Hey Fatty, we're all wondering whether you're meeting Kim to ask for asylum after your crimes get revealed by #Cohen and #Mueller this week		Any clues?
@RealSaavedra Every tin-pot fascist that has ever lived: 		“The majority of the press are now [insert insult of choice]. They are not on the side [that I am trying to appeal to]"

@WhiteHouse HAHAHAHAHA		Like Trump has ever read a book in his life!		HAHAHAHAHA
@realDonaldTrump You're going to jail traitor

@SenCapito The @POTUS is a fat, lazy, incompetent Russian asset		#PresidentsDay
@realDonaldTrump @foxandfriends Don't you have a JOB to do?		Stop watching TV. Get off your FAT ass and do some work. I thought there was meant to be some sort of 'emergency' happening?
@realDonaldTrump You sound like a bleating child
@realDonaldTrump @NBCNews So how come so many of your people are in jail?
@realDonaldTrump @foxandfriends Does this count as 'working' ? Watching TV and poking your phone.		I mean, it's not 11AM yet, so you're not officially on the clock right?
@DonaldJTrumpJr Four more sealed indictments posted this week. Who do you reckon they're for? Is that a posse of TV vans parked across the road, Junior?

@robbystarbuck @RepAdamSchiff Just a reminder: (You may have missed this because American media was banned): Trump boasting to the Russians, IN THE OVAL OFFICE about having sacked Comey to stop the investigation.

@bbluebelle @markknoller @PBI_Airport @WhiteHouse True. I’m glad she’s cooperating with the agencies trying to root out criminal acts and espionage. It’s the patriotic thing to do.
@RandPaul An incompetent, lazy @POTUS is not a state of Emergency. This is rubbish legislation by a lazy moron who can’t be bothered doing it the right way (he’d probably have to start work before 11).
@bbluebelle @markknoller @PBI_Airport Good point. I’m not arguing that FBI hasn’t been investigating @WhiteHouse obstruction for a year. I’m just commenting on fact that the *news* came out today. Also in Sanders’ defence she says she was happy to talk to them. (Although mysteriously failed to mention it for a year)
@RepMarkMeadows Nice work comrade. The check is in the mail.
@grump_ronald @markknoller @PBI_Airport That is totally inappropriate RG		There is nothing cool about threatening to beat up an old, overweight man suffering from dementia. Even if he is a Russian asset.
@markknoller @PBI_Airport Was Trump also heartened by today's news that		His campaign director Paul Manafort is going to jail for life		FBI has emails between his top advisor Roger Stone &amp; wikileaks re hacking		Sarah Sanders was interviewed by FBI about Trump Twr meeting btwn his campaign &amp; Russian agents
@bradheath Please rank today's news items in order of WOW:		A. Trump campaign director Paul Manafort going to jail for life		B. FBI has emails between Trump advisor Roger Stone and wikileaks		C. Sarah Sanders interviewed by FBI about Trump Twr meeting between Trump campaign &amp; Russian agents
@RepRWilliams @HouseDemocrats @FoxNews Oh, is it news time? I've got more news from today:		Trump campaign director Paul Manafort going to jail for life		FBI has emails between Trump advisor Roger Stone and wikileaks		Sarah Sanders interviewed by FBI about Trump Tower meeting between Trump campaign and Russian agents
@newtgingrich @WestwoodOne NEWS UNLIKELY TO BE MENTIONED IN EDITION ONE:		Trump campaign director Paul Manafort going to jail for life		FBI has emails between Trump advisor Roger Stone and wikileaks		WH secretary Sarah Sanders interviewed by FBI about Trump Twr meeting btwn Trump campaign &amp; Russian agents
@RepMattGaetz @IngrahamAngle SADLY NOT COVERED IN TONIGHT'S INTERVIEW:		Trump campaign director Paul Manafort going to jail for life		FBI has emails between Trump advisor Roger Stone and wikileaks		Sarah Sanders interviewed by FBI about Trump Tower meeting between Trump campaign and Russian agents

@charliekirk11 Were any of those NOT emergencies?
@charliekirk11 @AOC @KamalaHarris Climate denial is for dinosaurs
@RepAndyBiggsAZ @POTUS @realDonaldTrump An incompetent lazy @POTUS is not a state of emergency
@stucrew1 @PlatinumCat @rafrdfmjf @DonaldJTrumpJr It's tough to decide which is the most absurd, whether aliens are involved or whether Clinton set up the Trump Tower meeting. #desperatemuch?
@ConservJam @JacquesJulio @timboy9470 @PlatinumCat @DonaldJTrumpJr I don't like the phrase 'perjury trap' - I think it implies that being caught breaking the law isn't your fault. Gives crims too many "outs". Like saying a bank is 'a robbery trap'.... Just a law and order thing...
@ConservJam @JacquesJulio @timboy9470 @PlatinumCat @DonaldJTrumpJr I freely admit I'm not totally familiar with Flynn's case tho		Which lie to the FBI was he charged for? Would that change matters? Ie, was it when he lied to them about talking to Russian officials re sanctions/UN resolution. Or when he lied about being an agent for Turkish govt?
@ConservJam @JacquesJulio @timboy9470 @PlatinumCat @DonaldJTrumpJr You don't need to be read your rights for it to be perjury though. If I'm a witness in court, and thus under oath, and I lie, that's perjury, yeah?
@charliekirk11 What will national emergencies be used for by future POTUSs?		Trump doesn't care. He knows he'll either be dead or in jail by then.
@SenRickScott @POTUS Fun fact: Having a @POTUS who has a complete lack of negotiation skills and is innately LAZY is not, technically, a 'state of emergency'		If Trump wants to get something done, perhaps he needs to get out of bed before 11AM? #ExecutiveTime
@ConservJam @JacquesJulio @timboy9470 @PlatinumCat @DonaldJTrumpJr Perjury needs to be 'material', yeah? Ie, would affect a criminal case. Eg, lying about your weight doesn't count, but lying about whether you knew about Trump Twr meeting *would* count.		Does that apply to Comey's testimony to Congress? If so, I 100% agree. He should be charged.
@ConservJam @JacquesJulio @timboy9470 @PlatinumCat @DonaldJTrumpJr I think we agree the crime of perjury should be punished :)
@ConservJam @JacquesJulio @timboy9470 @PlatinumCat @DonaldJTrumpJr Comey is a Republican incidentally 		Perhaps the difference is that they didn’t collude with Russia?
@ConservJam @JacquesJulio @timboy9470 @PlatinumCat @DonaldJTrumpJr Perjury is a crime
@JacquesJulio @timboy9470 @PlatinumCat @DonaldJTrumpJr They lied for the same reason all crooks lie: because they’re guilty
@DonaldJTrumpJr Other than that meeting at Trump Tower, right, traitor?
@LindseyGrahamSC Will he reveal or conceal criminal, treasonous crimes? That’s all we want to know.
@RepMattGaetz Stone is a crook. Are you suddenly keen to keep crooks out of jail???
@Jim_Jordan True. Trump’s lawyer is a crook and a liar. Impressive.
@SenJohnKennedy Wait, I thought Trump told us repeatedly that MEXICO would be paying for the Wall???  This is a con!!
@charliekirk11 If Trump wasn’t a bankrupt sucking on Putin’s tit, why is he fighting so hard to hide those tax returns??
@RepMarkMeadows Didn’t that orange moron in the @WhiteHouse say, repeatedly, that MEXICO would pay for the Wall?		What kind of a rube would have fallen for that?
@SenAlexander @IvankaTrump @SenDougJones How wonderful that you are happy to work with this unqualified, inexperienced, unelected member of a crime family. You must be so proud.
@RivaVola @GOPChairwoman Explanation 1: They lied because they’re guilty		Explanation 2: umm, aliens and the Deep State and umm something about the media and umm ummm ummmmm
@GOPChairwoman Sadly, the fact that Republicans want to cover up Russian influence in America is no longer news
@RandPaul The only reason anyone opposes Barr is certainty that he will act to conceal treason and other crimes by the sitting @POTUS. 		The only reason the @GOP supports Barr is certainty that he will act to conceal treason and other crimes by the sitting @POTUS.
@Alyssafarah Laziest president in history
@RepAndyBiggsAZ The (Russian funded) @NRA thanks you for your support. The check is in the mail. 		(Spoiler: it’ll bounce. They’re going to jail)
@Sen_JoeManchin Will he suppress evidence of treason by the Russian asset in the @WhiteHouse ?
@SenShelby Wait, I thought Trump promised that MEXICO would pay for the Wall???
@charliekirk11 Unless we see massive amounts of evidence saying Trump ‘s campaign colluded woth Russia, right?	There’s no WAY we’d then just slide along to “collusion ain’t no big deal”, RIGHT??
@charliekirk11 I know where you’re coming from, but unfortunately a lazy, incompetent @potus does not ‘technically’ qualify as a State of Emergency
@realDonaldTrump ...and yet your associates keep getting arrested.
@DonaldJTrumpJr Aren’t you in jail yet?
@GOP @parscale ... but nothing before 11AM, because the lazy turd in the @WhiteHouse doesn’t start work until then
@realDonaldTrump Laziest president in history says what?
@realDonaldTrump Looking forward to the analysis of your tax returns. Russian loans much?
@realDonaldTrump Will you accept a broad pardon covering all crimes or will you demand individual pardons?
@CongressmanGT Climate denial is for dinosaurs
@GOPChairwoman Imagine what they’ll do once Comrade Trump is in jail for treason and every Republican who protected him is unelectable
@GOP @SecAzar Didn’t listen to SOTU. Did Comrade Trump mention whether he’ll accept a pardon for crimes committed?
@WhiteHouse @IvankaTrump What kind of country puts unqualified family members into high government positions? #bananarepublic
@GOP Climate denial will kill the GOP
@Pat_Tucker @TrumpStudents Good call. I will provide proof immediately. Oh, no, wait. I’m on ‘executive time’, ie watching tv and looking up kitten videos until 11AM.  Maybe later...
@TrumpStudents Not a Democrat, but personally it's Trump's racism, treason and laziness that I hate most.		Thanks for kickstarting this fun game. What else do people hate Trump for? And what prize will we win?
@McConnellPress @WKYT @POTUS @realDonaldTrump @senatemajldr traitor says what?
@DonaldJTrumpJr Is that the FBI knocking at your door?
@RealSaavedra Every sane American: "$5.7 billion for a border wall is a waste of money and the wall will never work"
@SenateGOP Climate denial will be the death of the @GOP. You have lost every voter under the age of 50. Where will you be in 20years?
@GOP @kayleighmcenany @IvankaTrump Yes, it's wonderful that an unqualified person gets a high position in government on the basis of their family #bananarepublic
@mkraju Surely he won't mind repeating that statement under oath		Because we all know that whether he helps conceal Trump's crimes will be the defining question of Barr's time in office.
@dailyondefense Alternatively, you could elect a @POTUS who's not a lazy, uninformed crook...
@kenolin1 @newtgingrich @realDonaldTrump A lazy dolt
@newtgingrich @realDonaldTrump Historic first State of the Nation to be delivered by a traitor?
@WhiteHouse I assume they delayed this to Prayer Morning Tea at 11 AM ?#executivetime #laziestpresidentinhistory
@senatemajldr How about a @POTUS that starts work before 11? #executivetime #laziestpresidentinhistory
@SteveKingIA @realDonaldTrump I missed the speech unfortunately. Did he mention whether he’ll accept a pardon?
@RepMarkMeadows Why are you so keen to keep Russian influence in America a secret? #traitor
@DonaldJTrumpJr Why are you retweeting a white supremacy website?
@marcorubio And lo did the gullible fools blindly follow yee bloated, pumpkin-coloured traitor-god, for their tiny brains were too fixated on electing crooked judges to care for the fate of their country	Humperdink 69:69
@DonaldJTrumpJr "Traitors die in prison"
@GovMikeHuckabee @realDonaldTrump @POTUS Somehow I think "first @POTUS to be jailed for treason" might get mentioned first in those history books
@realDonaldTrump Laziest @POTUS in history
@RepMarkMeadows When they wrote emergency powers laws, did they intend them for the "emergency" of a @POTUS too lazy to get out of bed before 11AM and negotiate a deal?
@BoleenGary @charliekirk11 @realDonaldTrump That is the best career advice I have ever received
@WayneDupreeShow Godbless you for forgiving trump for cheating on all 3 wives (not always with porn stars, only sometimes), cheating in business, lying constantly, dodging the draft and committing treason. You are a very forgiving soul.
@OrthodoxouMary @newtgingrich Jail? For telling Americans how LAZY their President is?
@newtgingrich And this means that America’s LAZY president watching tv until 11AM is somehow okay?
@marcorubio Follow yee not the orange moron for he makes yee look like a common rube
@newtgingrich Laziest president in history
@marcthiessen You don’t think Americans deserve to know how lazy their President is?
@GOPChairwoman @realDonaldTrump Laziest president in history  spends the first five hours of each working day on ‘executive time’ (aka watching tv)	Not to mention 150 days spent golfing in two years. 	No wonder he doesn’t have time to listen to his Intel briefings. https://t.co/SW19V2yZbz

The OECD just said that Australia "will fall short of its 2030 emissions target without a major effort to move to a low-carbon model”		This election will be goodbye to Liberals like @GregHuntMP &amp; @JoshFrydenberg and hello to sane (non-coal worshiping) conservative alternatives
@JoshFrydenberg The OECD just said that Australia "will fall short of its 2030 emissions target without a major effort to move to a low-carbon model”		This is why every Australian under the age of 70 will be voting out your government. (And many over that age too.)

@GOP To be honest, does it matter who  the Dems put up in 2020?		They'll be opposing @Mike_Pence, who will be universally reviled as the man who pardoned the traitor @realDonaldTrump and his crime family		The Democrats could put forward a dying potplant and they'd still win

Do you want it halted for some reason? Isnt investigating crimes against the US a good use of @fbi time?
@GOP Will he act to protect the @POTUS from public exposure of criminal acts, including treason?		That's really the main thing here, right?  		(Even tho it is good to hear that he was a nice boss.)

@GOP Nyet tovarich		I have too much self respect to align myself with traitors and racists		But thanks for asking

@RandPaul That’s great. I’d thought the @gop was too busy removing sanctions from your Kremlin crime buddies to get anything else done.
@SteveScalise @realDonaldTrump Manbaby disagrees https://t.co/vcSBB6njS6
@GOP Ah, those were simpler times, weren’t they? Back then an AG almost never had to rule on whether a sitting @POTUS should be charged with treason. Now, it’s the sole focus of both parties. Why is that?

@RepSmucker @SpeakerPelosi https://t.co/4F9bwfYf3a
@PCNedStark @realDonaldTrump @mike_pence @POTUS Sorry I’m not a lawyer. ‘Dicta’ means something the Supreme Court wrote, but it’s not legally binding. Is that right? So if someone wanted to argue a pardon had proven Trump guilty (for whatever reason, to deny him a credit card or something) it would have to be argued in court
@PCNedStark @realDonaldTrump But “In 1915, the Supreme Court wrote in Burdick v. United States that a pardon “carries an imputation of guilt; acceptance a confession of it.” 	Although that does answer my other question. @mike_pence wouldn’t have to wait until @POTUS was convicted; he could pardon in advance
@LeaveEUOfficial Um yes but Trump’s a Russian asset	Half his team are on trial for treason, or soon to be on trial, or already jailed. 	That’s relevant, right? Or am I missing something??

Supplementary question: is there any chance at all that @mike_pence might have sufficient spine to refuse to pardon a convicted traitor? Or that he’d fear it’d reflect too poorly on him / @GOP (people *still* despise Ford for pardoning Nixon)	Or is Pence too dim to worry?
Legal question: will Pres @mike_pence have to wait until *after* @POTUS is charged/arrested/convicted/sentenced to issue a pardon, or can he do it in advance?	Would 1 pardon cover treason, obstruction, campaign fraud, other crimes - or would Pence need to issue multiple pardons? https://t.co/XHaxQi1Wqx
