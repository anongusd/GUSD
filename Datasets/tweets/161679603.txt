Every youth deserves access to a rehabilitative juvenile program if they offend. Raising the age for juvenile program eligibility to 18 is the right step, but time is running out to pass these bills, so let your current and 2019 state lawmakers know that it's time to #RaiseTheAge
Marissa found individual support at Ingham Academy:		"It made me feel like someone actually cared for once.  At regular school, there are more kids in the classroom...and it’s hard to concentrate. But here, there are behavior specialists and you can get extra help." https://t.co/gfoTQObnwe
Kim found support and success at Ingham Academy, a juvenile justice program. "I’m comfortable today but not content where I’m at.

@TimKuiper1973 Thank you for sharing with us!! You're absolutely right - there is no one reason why foster parenting is hard, our next legislature and administration must expand special education program. And thank you for being a caregiver!!
Michigan fails to retain foster parents in part because it can be near-impossible for foster parents to access the child care to which they're entitled. Afterschool programs can help fill that need when school is out #KeepKidsLearning
Working families need care for their older children during summer when school gets out. Afterschool programs fill this critical need, and they #KeepKidsLearning, but funding gaps restrict access for many low-income Michigan families https://t.co/XNHb6mmKcB

Up to 900 disadvantaged and vulnerable children may lose access to child care, 	an essential service for working parents. #MISequester
2490 low income students will lose aid to help them finance the costs of college. 1300 fewer students will get work-study jobs #MISequester
Michigan will lose around $22 million in funding for primary and secondary education and 25,000 fewer students would be served. #MISequester
Do you ever find yourself lying awake at night wondering how the sequester will effect Michigan? Stay tuned for the 	@whitehouse 	 breakdown
