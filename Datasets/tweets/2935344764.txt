Water supply is going to affect energy and energy costs #water #CAdrought #ad55h2o
If and when #ElNino comes, ppl assume we're ok, we still need to have a conservation mentality (Emily France) #water #CAdrought #ad55h2o

52% of CA's water is used by state and federal conservation laws. The real number is closer to 40% (Larry Dick)  #water #cadrought #ad55h2o
80% of CA's water used by agriculture. (Larry Dick)  #water #cadrought #ad55h2o ... but that's not the whole story

This goes far beyond "let your lawn go brown" (Emily France)  #water #cadrought #ad55h2o
If biz's get fined for over #water usage, they pass hose costs along to customers, or they leave CA (Emily France) #cadrought #ad55h2o
