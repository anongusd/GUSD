@Crabin @jupin of course!
@aherman2006 he's been doing that police siren joke for so many years and i keep waiting for it to show up in a special
@Crabin @jupin just that it isn't available online until 30 days after its release date. doesn't have to run in theaters all that time, theaters just get a bite at it. Netflix did a version of this with Roma, which they gave a 21-day window
this SNL is def one of the best of the season, but perfectly illustrative of where the show's at: the ensemble is a bunch of pros, the sketch writing is good and inventive, the political stuff is dire

@DiscoPaco smaller movies and studios give their films theatrical windows
@theinkedknight @kzap333 nobody is suggesting that films can't be on netflix. just a 30 day cinema window.
@kzap333 @theinkedknight yeah I am not too interested in a cold-blooded free market argument here. if you don't think the cinema experience is valuable and worth protecting, that's fine! just not an argument i'm making
@theinkedknight then 30 days later it‚Äôs on netflix. was the slight wait for Roma an issue? this is trying to find a way for both models to continue thriving
@jptres92 so what‚Äôs the problem
@jptres92 he is fighting to preserve the existence of the theater experience, which this would help do. no one‚Äôs going to force movies to be in multiplexes for months. but theaters can at least have the chance to offer something exclusive. this is the opposite of myopic
@jptres92 yes? that‚Äôs called a limited release. it‚Äôs very normal
Netflix gave ROMA a three week window and i‚Äôm p sure the world didn‚Äôt end! this is just calling for a window, not for films to actually play in theaters all four weeks https://t.co/aR16VfAKE0
@davidehrlich @suspiriana guys it wouldn‚Äôt have to BE IN THEATERS for a month it‚Äôd just have to wait a month before hitting netflix
@Da7e it's very good!
@jhoffman talking about testing people for voting eligibility is a very dangerous and very familiar road in this country but it ain't a good one!!!! (i know you are kidding)
@alissamarie well, sure. but foreign film has very specific rules--has to be submitted by a country, release in USA is not required at all--and doc film eligibility is largely tied to film festivals. it'd definitely require additional rules changes
@jhoffman jordannn
@alissamarie no, def not. docs and foreign films is not what studios are worried about
@jhoffman no
@alissamarie those two categories have always had special oscar rules that wouldn't be governed by this

@antovolk @AnotherAshwin in the U.S. yes. not anywhere else. my guess is that if Netflix and the theater chains do come to an agreement, it'll narrow the window significantly. that's the big breakthrough that hasn't come yet
@antovolk @AnotherAshwin how so? theatrical windowing, and distribution rights, are different country by country. Netflix will get something on its service as quickly as possible, every time. that is their #1 philosophy
@AnotherAshwin yes, and yes
@AnotherAshwin I don't think Netflix figuring out a better arrangement re U.S. theatrical windowing would have any impact on its releases in India!
@ChrisThilk every company has plenty of debt--but Netflix RAISES additional debt every year to fund its moviemaking, which is unusual
in conclusion, Kathryn Hahn was snubbed for PRIVATE LIFE
Netflix had some amazing movies in 2018, some of which were totally forgotten. The ones that lingered in the conversation were the ones it bothered to four-wall in theaters and devote big marketing campaigns to. Funny how that works!
the company just spent $50 million on a for your consideration ad campaign. of course old Hollywood is spooked--and it knows that Oscars are one thing this company actually cares about

@AKlay19 @jptres92 @kylebuchanan it‚Äôs done good, but it is nothing compared to the smash hits AMPAS was desperate to    award with a popular film category this year. that is the point I am making
@joereid yes! i'm not even saying the Oscars should avoid that kind of movie. but if AMPAS is fretting about relevance, here's something to consider
right now, GREEN BOOK has grossed a little less than NIGHT SCHOOL and a little more than THE FIRST PURGE. with a Best Picture bump, it'll probably move up the 2018 rankings above SMALLFOOT and I CAN ONLY IMAGINE
put aside the (worthwhile) debate over Green Book's storytelling flaws. fundamentally, it is not a film that connected with ticket-buyers in a major way. it did fine! made a healthy profit! about $70 mil! these days that's the kind of movie that wins Best Picture, again and again
exactly right. forget who's hosting, what categories you present, what time slot you're in. THIS would have gotten the oscars the ratings/relevance they craved. but you can't make voters' minds up for them! https://t.co/yzFT4s2XwC
@kylebuchanan with a preferential ballot, I think so
@kylebuchanan sadly true. but in recent years they do keep gravitating towards these small or mid budget movies that gross $30-60m and are best known as best picture winners. I love some of them, am indifferent to others, but this is the pattern bailey thought he could solve w/‚Äúmost popular‚Äù
@joereid it's so good. i love a surprise because it makes everyone even more expressive

@maddiewhittle the Oscars are organically able to acknowledge shifts in pop culture, even if they can be a little slow about it; in proposing that award, John Bailey was searching for a quick fix he didn‚Äôt need, which is why he was so derided
@maddiewhittle well that was one reason the reaction to that announcement was one of total bafflement. black panther seemed set for a BP nom anyway

@stefabsky @ezwrites @soniasaraiya it‚Äôs too late, you‚Äôre both doomed
@maddiewhittle it wasn‚Äôt. Black Panther was practically a lock since Feb as long as Disney campaigned for it (they did). Beale was a more quiet, esoteric, and challenging movie that was not the primary campaign concern of its studio

@Die_Wil_Wheaton nope! nothing that's not in the trailer
@zinoman @MarkHarrisNYC like, I don't even love the guy, but hosting the Oscars right now is a gig literally purpose built for James Corden. there's one reason it ain't happening
@zinoman @MarkHarrisNYC I think the evidence of no host is more because of two things: ABC refuses to hand the gig to any out-of-network late night host, and the comedians who have sold out MSG in recent years are Kevin Hart, Louis CK, and Aziz Ansari
@zinoman I hear this argument a lot but don't really get it. Stewart, Rock, Martin, Crystal, Goldberg, DeGeneres all reaped the benefits of hosting well! It's not like any of them had career downswings as a result. The only notable "flops" were Letterman (who was unaffected) and Franco
@zinoman @kylebuchanan like, I know we live in brand-conscious times, but I do think there's still room for a host with a monologue
@zinoman @kylebuchanan you don't think it's maybe better to have someone who can poke fun at Hollywood's foibles rather than just having a network pick stars within its stable to help celebrate the making of money?
@zinoman @kylebuchanan people love The Avengers, but there's a reason The Avengers don't host awards show, and we'll soon see evidence of that
@kristapley ooh I like that blackklansman is high up there!
@kylebuchanan @zinoman instead we're just gonna get a show that's ABC being like "you know what people love? The Avengers!"
@kylebuchanan @zinoman of course! the host is the show's personality, will dictate what the segments are, etc
@zinoman this century alone, we've had amazing jobs by Martin, Rock, Stewart, and DeGeneres IMO. and Jackman's year was a total blast. It's not that hard!! ABC has just gotten more and more nervous about handing someone the reins
@zinoman i‚Äôm just always gonna be resistant to the argument ‚Äúthe oscars are bad anyway.‚Äù people love this show for a reason! and it has had some genuinely thrilling hosting moments over the years, imo (martin being the best of them)
@kristapley what's next closest? Black Panther?
@zinoman it is not the best room for comedy, BUT without a host it has absolutely no personality whatsoever and the entire show is just dictated by producers, which is genuinely abhorrent to watch. 2019 will be a catastrophe but that's ok they have to make this mistake every so often

I know, I know, Hollywood makes five of these a year, but I'm a total sucker for them!
me, I'm easy. I like any movie that's about a team of scientists that have to go underwater because there's a sphere
@MarkHarrisNYC and also it‚Äôs not a combination that‚Äôs going away anytime soon, right? which is worrying
@MarkHarrisNYC yes. to think in 2019, as viewing numbers are only getting more split/fractured, that there's some new audience that can be drawn in with a few tweaks is...ludicrous

@EvilCEOE it's competing against Beale Street, Favourite, Mary Queen of Scots, At Eternity's Gate, and every other major limited release geared towards Oscars that flood specialty theaters in December

@rumourzzz no one‚Äôs arguing for an eight month window! just for the very notion of a theatrical window, which is all that is going to keep indie theaters alive. not trying to conjure straw men, just pointing out that the argument is a little more reasonable than sometimes characterized
@rumourzzz *releases. no one is arguing against streaming access! just for theaters to get a small release window to try and make some money, because day-and-date is tough to compete with
@rumourzzz no, they do not argue for eight months. the current window between a wide theater release and a streaming release is 90 days, and netflix has already shown some willingness to negotiate on that front. a compromise is easy to reach, with only a slight delay between represses

@ekeyed @MarkHarrisNYC @adambvary @kateyrich @ezwrites @kylebuchanan @alisonwillmore @itsdlevy i mean, if you're saying let's just junk the golden globes, i'm all for it
@MarkHarrisNYC @adambvary @kateyrich @ezwrites @kylebuchanan @alisonwillmore @itsdlevy it should just be drama and comedy, yes. that was my original thought!
@kateyrich @kristapley @ezwrites @kylebuchanan yes
@joereid @kateyrich @ezwrites @kylebuchanan one of them disappears for a big chunk of the movie, one of them instigates all the plot and the movie ends on her! so i'm cool with stone in lead, weisz/colman in supporting
@joereid @kateyrich @ezwrites @kylebuchanan should just be stone!
@kateyrich @kristapley @ezwrites @kylebuchanan agree
@ManiLazic rude
@ManiLazic excuse me
@kylebuchanan @cinephile24 yes. also, he's a guy who comes in and out of hazes. there's something kinda martian about him, even as he goes on and on about finding one's truth
for crying out loud ENOUGH https://t.co/1g9fG9kFDM
@alisonwillmore @MarkHarrisNYC @adambvary @kateyrich @ezwrites @kylebuchanan i would put it in the "damndest thing you ever saw" category
@alisonwillmore @MarkHarrisNYC @adambvary @kateyrich @ezwrites @kylebuchanan it's def a comedy imo
@cinephile24 @melvillmatic the movie would prob benefit from being 3 hours like the others are, but...3 hours is long
@MarkHarrisNYC @adambvary @kateyrich @ezwrites @kylebuchanan @alisonwillmore oh! I thought you were asking Adam! Nashville ain't a musical, though it is a musical film?
@melvillmatic @cinephile24 yes!!! isn't that a good thing? idk i love the movie so I guess I have to be all in on brads
@CoreyAtad @cinephile24 @melvillmatic yes. and I like that his contempt is more fueled by rockist notions of "authenticity" and "truth" than his personal stake in fame. cause that's how dudes can be!!!!
@MarkHarrisNYC @adambvary @kateyrich @ezwrites @kylebuchanan i would agree with this yeah
@melvillmatic @cinephile24 hey that's just my opinion man etc.! in every other version, I find the male lead to be way too plot device-y. the alcoholism feels like a plot device, the jealousy feels like a plot device, there's no character there (and I still love the performances). didn't find that here!
@joereid @kateyrich @ezwrites @kylebuchanan hmm it def shouldn't
@adambvary @kateyrich @ezwrites @kylebuchanan yeah but the idea that "musical" automatically puts you into the comedy category is silly. i don't care about GG terminology, that movie is a DRAMA
@melvillmatic @cinephile24 i think the bedrock of their romance is how creatively inspired he is by their partnership...the fame stuff is def there! but feels a little more peripheral than prior iterations

@bobbyfinger @bendreyfuss yes. I have also been told that it is their ‚Äúright‚Äù to recline like that button‚Äôs in the constitution or something
@poniewozik @bendreyfuss 100%
@bendreyfuss i‚Äôm saying, at a certain point airlines squished things together so close that they should have probably just made it so seats can‚Äôt recline. but instead they just make you politely request the stranger in front of you, who 50% of the time is not very nice!!!
@bendreyfuss it also universally makes it near impossible for anyone to use a laptop
@bendreyfuss if someone reclines their seat it literally crushes my knees because airlines long ago stopped caring about providing a humane level of legroom but are too cheap to actually replace chairs. so they just move them all closer together

@squanderingfree yeah, I 100% stick by that word. Netflix has been very forceful about day-and-date releasing, to the point that it waged war on Cannes this year. changing that as a consideration to filmmakers/award would be a serious shift
@squanderingfree literally where do I make the argument that they don't care about subscribers? it's been widely reported that Netflix is considering an exclusive theatrical release for Roma, which it'd be wise to do. that would be a fundamental change in their release strategy
