Many people not paying any property or school tax are living off tax payers.  This includes illegal inmigrants in our schools.   Why should U.S. property owners pay?  Tax the families who bring them here instead.
When a state has a high population moving in, property owners should have LESS tax assessment, not more.  The government is not in business.   Even less tax for those over 50, especially LESS school tax.  Non property owners should pay their share too.
