@MrJackGrant @timjinx yep. super normal. very much a good way to run a state. yep.
@timjinx yeah, I'm sure she is. Read the whole thread.
Because also I didn‚Äôt think that banishment was a thing we did? What is this, Verona in whenever Romeo and Juliet is set?? This is the UK, in 2019, and we have legal responsibilities. She can face legal repercussions here. That is how being British &amp; committing crimes should work
But that is entirely different to acting like a groomed 15 year old is evil or not allowing someone who is British and HAS A CHILD back in the country.
And to be clear - I do not trust this kid. But that‚Äôs why we need to work out how we deradicalise people; because yes, we need to be cautious and careful.
Like, that‚Äôs super normal and the fact that people are acting like she‚Äôs a monster cause of it is honestly so strange to me.
And on the not freaking out over what she‚Äôs seen - your brain LITERALLY does not let you fully comprehend that kinda shit cause you will not be able to cope with it. Not fully comprehending the horror of it is a super standard coping mechanism.
On the lack of regret; that is how grooming works. You don't fully grasp the realities of it overnight. It takes years to pull the gunk of it off of your brain. She was literally fifteen; your whole perspective can be so twisted &amp; warped by someone; that doesn't go away overnight
I've seen repeated many, many times that a. she doesn't seem to fully show remorse and b. she doesn't seem to show much horror at what she has seen (specifically, she has referred seeing decapitated heads in bins).
The whole...thing that is the argument about whether Shamima Begum should be allowed back into the UK has been so deeply bizarre to me.

Surely a left wing platform for the economy should be radical on this stuff? Not accepting the false idea that better ways of working must mean a sacrifice in terms of pay?
It isn't as if average British wages right now are actually good. Like, if you would take a pay cut to have this then I don't know how much you are being paid but...
I get where this is coming from, but there are options that are more flexible in terms of working from or have shorter working weeks...but they aren't paid enough? Surely the goal would be more flexible work arrangements and shorter working weeks with the same paycheck? https://t.co/xROeQtHK6E

@Samfr And like, this is hardly the biggest problem they are dealing with but can you imagine being a teen, really worried about their exams, and reading your tweet? That would have certainly been deeply unpleasant for me at the time.
@Samfr And one with no greater evidence than my "a lot of teens agree with me" one?
@Samfr Like what do you think "a lot of teachers agree with me so I must be right" is if not an assertion?
@Samfr All I'm saying is listening to personal experience is good. And mental health is not studied sufficiently studied - your teacher based evidence is exactly as anecdotal as mine so what's the difference?
@Samfr So a thing you can do is not do that.
@Samfr And they do tell people; they just tell people they see as peers and won't tell people in any kind of position of authority...for many reasons but among which is because people in authority do things like dismiss their feelings cause there is not "sufficient evidence".
@Samfr I mean yeah? Obviously? We all know the reality of teen mental health problems is a whole thing, right? Like...we have historically called it teen angst to dismiss it but that's what wrong. I don't... I'm just saying what as far as I'm aware is common knowledge.
@Samfr I mean as a teen I had MH issues and the idea of calling the NSPCC would have been like... hard nope, and avoiding teachers knowing was an imperative. This was just normal and standard for all of us.
@Samfr *you're
@Samfr I...I mean I don't know how your defining out of control but by that I mean "going without any sort of help or treatment" and I feel very confident a million is a lower estimate of the reality for that. And we HAVE noticed. Plenty of us have...
@Samfr I said "every teen I know with out of control anxiety". I was talking about every teen I know with out of control anxiety....
@Samfr I didn't say every teen I know. A large number though? A majority? Yep.		What's your evidence that is unrepresentative?
This. But also the idea that my last name coming from my very lovely father is equivalent to changing it is pretty wild.		I don't not want to change my name because it's a man's name I'll be changing it to; I don't wanna change it cause I already have a perfectly good last name. https://t.co/lm8gCUe4oy
@Samfr And no, we don't; and we should collect it. But until we do, I don't see that telling every teen I know with out of control anxiety about exams that their experiences haven't been properly studied so we don't know if they are true is particularly helpful.
@Samfr I mean, it's a lot more than a few anecdotes.
Mental health is massively under researched and there is an unfortunate reality that if we ignore any first hand testimony which has yet to be fully researched we will be dismissing and undermining the lived experience of a tonne of people. https://t.co/2Sbhb31j9A

Anyway I know it's very sad to tweet about this on a Friday night, but in my defense I'm looking at twitter for the first time today whilst waiting in the queue for the bar and am just a bit wtf about all of this.
But so many left people who, to repeat, VOTED REMAIN, have decided to act like the EU is this total enemy to a socialist agenda which....they clearly didn't think in 2016? And nothing has massively changed since so...?
The way that left people who voted Remain in 2016 are not claiming that being in the EU is this huge barrier to socialism is just bizzare. Why did you vote Remain then?! Literally nothing has changed. If your whole deal is "will of the people", that's one thing.
AND we could push such an agenda for workers across the continent, and avoid any deportations of EU workers from the UK or UK workers working on the EU AND push for more pro immigration policies for none EU migrants from every EU country.
The idea that privatisation is an EU phenomenon rather than a capitalist phenomenon is so weird.		If we had a Labour government, and were in the EU, we would still bring in radical workers rights legislation. We would also have a strong enough economy to support that agenda. https://t.co/VaRZQp2zha

@davidiancollins and yes she lied, and yes she behaved wrongly but she was angry because that is what happens when you live in a society which corners you. And I don't LIKE her. I don't like her politics, I don't like her being in the shad cab. but this shouldn't be about that.
@davidiancollins how is it not about race when a white MPs kid deals drugs and the UK press rearranges themselves around making it ok?! how is it not about race when white people take drugs like it's legal and black people can't.

@mralanjohnsmith In Hammersmith, I had a team of super vols who did call time for me and was why we were able to mobilise the way they did, and they did the calls cause I set the standards and the goals.		But there should be more staff to do this, rather than relying on volunteers.
@mralanjohnsmith *nod* that is a very valid point - and I think it's both. We need more resources for staff; it's absolutely unfair on our current staff how badly staffed we are.		But also; US organizers HAVE to do call time. The amount of calls you make a day is one of your goals.

@markdedrick My legs are in a lot of pain, my lungs are for sure not working properly and there's something wrong with the small toe on my right foot...and I wasn't even solidly knocking all four days; so yeah, I feel you.
@markdedrick Back at you!
(I'd apologize for the typos in this but I mean...I have had about four hours sleep a night for the past four days so...)
But also just this - field is wild and you do things and meet the most amazing people and it's great. Your legs hurt like hell and you're exhausted and you get to change the damn world, one door at a time.
I have some actual thoughts on these elections; on how state by state they were, on the importance of good candidates, on the ridiculous level of bravery, integrity and community I saw from all the New Mexico candidates.
The timing also meant a lot of moments of people in the car yelling "oh fuck" and not knowing if it was cause they had seen we had lost in North Dakota or cause the cars tires had sunk too deep into the gravel.
We nearly had to abandon the car several times - which of course would also have left us stranded on a dirt road somewhere just over the Texas border.		We didn't, we made it back onto the main road, after an hour of off roading.
I guess we decided we needed more adventures. So we took (I mean, for real, by accident) took a wrong turn and ended up off road, with all that comes with, including the car sinking into gravel and us having to push it.
So that should be the end of the adventure, right? Back in the car and to the party. 		Well...
We bought far too much food - forgetting, I think, that folks would want a snack...not, like, ten packets of chips each. But better too much than too little.
The line had all voted by 8; an hour after polls closed.		Could be worse; we could be Georgia.
Line watching is truly nice; you give folks sustenance and make sure they stay in line so they can get to vote. I spent a lot of time giving parents breaks from talking to their tired kids, and handed out Kit Kats.
@ArjunMittra Haha (but yeah more Barnet to Leeds, or Barnet to Newcastle for some of them)
And this line is long. https://t.co/sIGJAskYjU
Food gets thrown in the car, and Lauren absolutely hits the gas down the highway. We reach Anthony just before 7.		So, for Brits, depending on the state, polls close at either 7 or 8 (I know right?); 7 in New Mexico.		But if you're in line at 7 you can still vote.
Aaron gets the receipt whilst I ready the trolley (saves us 5 seconds). Then the guy at the door needs to see our receipt? We show him and apparently we paid for something not in the cart?		"Consider it a donation!" And we sprint out.
@ArjunMittra 100% worse
The staffer dealing with self service finishes with one group and goes to her next one. "Uh...I think you should serve them first", they say, pointing at us. So thanks to those folks for their service to democracy.
We need staff approval and the only member of staff has two groups to deal with before us. I'm losing my mind. There's another member of staff standing by the door so I go to ask him if he can help us, basically nearly crying with desperation, but nope.
We get to the self service checkout and, not unsurprisingly, the other folks there aren't in the rush that we are in. I don't think I have ever been so stressed in a supermarket.		We finally get to this check out and of course we have more stuff than can fit in the bagging area.
So then I am literally running around Walmart with a returner from Task Force Hobbs, who I had only therefore met that morning, grabbing food and water.		It was like that scene in Paper Towns. 		We got a lot of stares - I mean who runs in a Walmart?
*Walmart
@lisab7us @jules_amin We haven't even gotten to me crying in Walmart yet
Oh and to loop back to deployment for the Brits; those places aren't close to each other. New Mexico is a big place. These are huge distances we were asking people to go.
We land at six. Get sent a list of polling locations with long lines. We need to get to Wallmart, get food and water, and get to the longest lines.		We get into two cars (after briefly managing to lose and then find again one of our team...not sure what happened there)
At this point I finally eat something - two packets of potato chips I grabbed when leaving the staging location - for the first time I think since about 6pm the day before.
So we smash the hell out of the packets in Hobbs (including some drive by canvassing with some maybe less than strictly legal u-turns) and get back on the plane that I may have mentioned we were traveling by. https://t.co/rWNgE3xttm
We need you to drive to and from Roswell for a days doorknocking even though that basically means driving overnight? Sure.		People will step up and people did step up and whoops I'm crying now.
We need you to get in a car right now and get to Carlsbad or Alamogordo and also knock out at least four packets while you're there? Sure.
(His dad also went with him - just casually moving to a whole other city for four days within an hour of being asked to do so)
The thing about doing deployment is you realize quite what people are willing to do. 21 year old college kid who is competent as heck and knows what's up? Want to just move to Silver City and be the solid pillar around which that campaign revolves?
Tbc on my Dallas layover... https://t.co/R3ULAW2aHK
The daughter comes to the door. She's a Dem, and she's going to go vote, but she tells me it in a hushed tone, glancing back to check her clearly Republican parents aren't eavesdropping. Kids like her are "the change", or whatever the hell you wanna call it.
And the house where we pulled up to see a Pearce sign...not a good start. But the person we have on our list is 19. So I go up, keep the "Vote Today" side of my lit &amp; not the candidate side visible, knock and speak to the mom and just ask to talk to her daughter "about voting"
Two of my favorite doors: the guy who told me he and his wife had gone to vote at 8:30am "as I told the guy who knocked at the weekend we would" #MakeAPlan
So we FLY into Hobbs (have I mentioned that we flew? Cause we flew). We land. Folks are there with cars &amp; we get in and we go. None of us stop knocking between 9am and 4:30, by which time we have knocked the whole of Hobbs. Something that would have seemed impossible on Saturday.
So driving is not an option.		But we have a volunteer who is a pilot....and has a plane.		And this is how I ended up starting election day at 7am at Las Cruces airport being deployed by private plane. https://t.co/VTZvtHsrLp
By Monday the whole of Hobbs had been knocked at least once, much of it twice. 		But for election purposes, we needed a third save of backup to join Task Force Hobbs. We had the people, but Hobbs is a five hour drive from Cruces. We were still in Cruces doing packets at midnight.
On Saturday, we had folks flying in from DC and NY. They got in, got in cars and went to this random place none of them had ever been before. We got them motels. We got them the last rental car available in Hobbs. They set up a whole GOTV operation whilst doing it.
Some background on task force Hobbs; that there is Republican turf. But Republican turfs has undecideds and Democrats in it. And we needed to talk to them.
So we are working out our deployment plan and we needed a crack team to join Task Force Hobbs.
We organized ourselves out of jobs again and again and on Monday evening we were in a situation where all the turf was ready, our turf captains knew what was up, our priority order was a thing of beauty, our trainer could do turf return and I had no reason to be there anymore.
We were just in a really good place in Las Cruces. We went from an assumption that all the organizers would have to come back to Cruces for election day to not just not having them come back, but deploying our people to other areas. And I'm real damn proud of that. https://t.co/BdYQHZWcvL
Anyway, a lot of work and a lot of turf related paper cuts on my part (and several now amusing but at the time not so much points of confusion, such as the time I acquired a turf that was not on my list and was like "how did we grow an extra turf?!")...
And here's a real thing - folks were not there cause of Trump. That was for some why they are paying a bit more attention now. But they were here for Xoch and Michelle and Martin. Good candidates are what motivates people, always, at the end of the day.
And then with that we had so many new, first time volunteers who just came to do the work and damn they did the work.		NM CD2 has not historically been a place with much organization, cause it's not been a place we could ever win. That all changed this cycle.
Which is in no small part due to a crack team of super volunteers who just took packet after packet after packet. They were folks from New Mexico and folks who had come from elsewhere (including flying in from Kenya) and they were relentless.
So the three days before election day were just...we smashed it in Las Cruces. We were not just hitting our goals; we were beating them by country miles.
Alright gang. Its 9am, I have slept for about 3 hours and am drinking a cocktail in El Paso airport and am going to do a super self indulgent thread about my election day cause it was a wild ride from start to end.

Taylor did not say "if you are a racist vote for racists". She said "I believe racism is bad". Yes, people who complain about her saying anything are inevitably free speech hypocrites.		But she isn't being attacked cause she said people should vote for politicians they agree with
This isn't quite true? What she did was better; she said she believed in rights for people who have been, &amp; are still oppressed.		That very belief is attacking people who believe otherwise.		They are going to attack back. That's why we have to be ready to fight for those beliefs. https://t.co/DhHAA3yjAX

@logueys In some ways there's a lot of parallels to this border. So many people live and work between both countries, have family and friends on both sides...but the border is this strict, enforcing and dividing thing.

And like, there have been lots of people and lots of Jewish people particularly articulating why the Corbyn wing of the party had an issue with anti-Semitism; the history and structures behind it.		So seeming confused just seems like...you aren't paying attention?
It's something that can be found against and solved, but understanding why it's there is part of that, and being like "oh this is just so confusing I don't get it" looks like you aren't trying to do that.
But the reality is, there are lots of concrete and not massively hard to understand reasons why there is a real issue with structural anti-Semitism from the brand of left wingism Corbyn comes from.
Ok so here's a thing - and this isn't an attack on Laura who clearly meant this in good faith - but I don't find the idea it's bewildering helpful? And I see this a lot...this "I have no idea HOW this could be happening attitude".		And obviously, I get where it comes from. https://t.co/D4o43y6CyK

If you live in London and want to donate basic items:		- St Mary‚Äôs Hospital, Praed St, W2 1NY, Maternity Ultrasound Reception‚Ää, Cambridge Wing		- Queen Charlotte Hospital, Du Cane Rd, W12 0HS, Maternity Ultrasound Reception		Collection hours 09.00am- 4.00pm Monday to Friday
The municipality of Rafina-Pikermi, one the zones hit hardest by the fires, has announced the opening of an account in collaboration with Piraeus Bank, accepting donations for those wishing to contribute.		Piraeus Bank ŒôŒíŒëŒù: GR20 0172 1860 0051 8609 2291 418
The Hellenic Red Cross has opened an account where people can donate.		Eurobank IBAN: GR64 0260 2400 0003 1020 1181 388		Including this because various people on the ground were, but I understand why some people refuse to donate to the Red Cross which is totally understandable.
OK so info from tumblr (apparently a news source now, who knew):		@DOTW_UK Greek bank accounts (just transfer):		National Bank of Greece IBAN: GR27 0110 1410 0000 1412 9611 217	Alpha Bank IBAN: GR06 0140 1990 1990 0200 2002 401	Piraeus Bank IBAN: GR03 0172 0180 0050 1800 5706 640
@jhallwood I'm gonna do a proper look through everything when I'm awake so will let you know
Does anyone who is not dumb like me know where would be good to donate to the people who need it in Greece right now?

Also, actually, a better comparison would be the fact that the leader's office has taken action against her but not Chris Williamson is abhorrent to say the least.
(that being said, full solidarity with Margaret Hodge who should obviously not have any action taken against her full stop)
Morally, I understand the point here, but structurally this is PLP action not party action, is my understanding? And the PLP mechanisms are much better set up to deal with stuff than the party ones imo. https://t.co/bafcqKz5Fe
And again, even if you don't fully agree with the above reasoning, I do not understand why not adopting the IHRA definition is the hill you'd be willing to die on when it would literally just be easier to do what the vast bulk of Jewish voices are asking you to do?
Because it's anti-Semitism and we should be CLEAR that it's anti-Semitism.
I would be wrong if I said that the sky was pink, but should I be kicked out of the party for it? Obviously not. Should I be kicked out of the party for saying Jews are more loyal to Israel than Labour? Obviously yes.
It is truly fantastic that the party now can kick people out for racism, sexism etc (thanks @JewishLabour for making that happen) but to that to work you have to show a person is being one of those things? "Wrong" is a very vague term.
esp within the context of the current party rules I have no doubt that that difference would mean people who have accused Jews of "duel loyalties" would be much less likely to be kicked out of the party.
This is a great thread. There is a substantive difference between saying something is wrong and saying it is anti-Semetic. https://t.co/8nWlBs7jcF
I stand in absolute solidarity with the Palestinian people. I think many many of Israel's actions are appauling. 		If you are scared of saying these things because you think you might be accused of anti-Semitism...maybe it's cause you are also being anti-Semetic ü§î https://t.co/QWypGeil3Z
The lack of consultation with the Jewish community has obviously been appauling. But I don't see why that means we need to reopen the consultation when they, despite this, went to great efforts to make their views clear?		https://t.co/rNspA7XN0f		https://t.co/mQ57kp6HsJ
So, @thhamilton pretty much said this yesterday but...I don't get why we don't just adopt the IHRA definition of anti-Semitism? Of course it's The Right Thing To Do but it would also just be easier? It being the hill people are willing to die on seems odd.

Well, I flagged a passing taxi and gave up on getting a bus all together.
And without seeing the 17a bus I'm not sure how I would have known to Google specifically the 17a.
In my defense a lot of the time it's honestly impossible to work it out in advance/from the internet. Like, once I'd searched "number 17a bus route" it was really obvious. 		But no amount of googling place names and bus routes had led me to that page before that.
You think by now I'd actually find out how to get from a to b I'm advance of my trips, but no.
The good news is I think I've worked out what bus I need to get. 		The bad news is, I only worked this out by having the bus arrive, seeing the number, not getting on and then afterwards googling it's route.		So now I have to wait for the next bus.

@mummywoodzy ...over the past few years for example; but that is not a reason, as the Labour Party, for us not to hold ourselves to higher standards, or a very good answer when Jewish voters are understandably unable to bring themselves to vote Labour cause of institutional anti-Semitism...
@mummywoodzy The answer on anti-Semitism is yes, and that in our party the leadership has been previously anti-Semetic in the past which is not true of the, absolutely awful, Tories. This is no defence of the Tories - I'd argue they have shown themselves to be fundimentally Islamophobic...

. @RuthSmeeth is an absolute hero. I have always been inspired by her dedication as an MP; her commitment to Labour values of community, solidarity and standing up for people. And her strength in standing up to horrendous anti-Semitic abuse is awe inspiring. What a champion.
@eve338 I don't know a single Jew who would EVER use it as an "excuse politically". And - I'm sure you said it with no bad intent - but your tweet, which was at a fantastic Labour activist, seemed to dismiss the reality of the anti Semitism I know he personally has faced.
@eve338 *why you think you haven't seen it, I mean. You kinda need to know what anti-Semitism is, again like any other oppression, to know it when you see it! :)
@eve338 And if you don't know what it means then that would probably explain why you haven't seen it? At the end of the day it's definitely there; and those experiencing it need our support and solidarity ‚úä
@eve338 Hi Eve! Unfortunately most Jews I know would also love to get on with their lives; but the reality, as it is for all groups facing bigotry, is it's kind of hard for them when living under the shadow of anti Semetic abuse.

I think to fight hate we need to really, proactively engage with each other. Build bridges, share ideas and understanding, work together. https://t.co/amoHaSg5yr
The same can be said with Islam and really with all oppressed cultures, communities and groups.		Now is the time - I mean, really the time was years ago but... - to not just tolerate people; to ignore them but leave them be.
And this is for all of us - including myself - who are not Jewish; if we really want to make things better it's on us to learn about and engage with Jewish history, culture and community.
I hope Corbyn will make an effort to reach out to, visit and engage with lots of different parts of the Jewish community.		I've been thinking a lot recently about how calling out anti-Semitism really isn't enough. It's important, but not enough.
We don't have a right to define people's Judaism for them; or to tell them how they should be reacting to anti-Semitism either.		But when the majority of a community has expressed concerns &amp;you choose to only go to a Passover meal with those that have defended you? It's cowardly.
Anyone attacking Jewdas as "not proper Jews" is very much in the wrong here, especially for those of us who aren't Jewish; it's frankly quite appalling.
I've been reading &amp; listening to a lot of Jewish voices today. Luisa sums it up well. 		Nothing wrong with Corbyn visiting Jewdas, but there's a vast, vibrant, diverse Jewish community &amp; Corbyn ONLY engaging with a minority who do not share the concerns the majority have is wrong https://t.co/5ycnKasJe8

Offord also attacked the borough commander for not knowing of one specific crime that took place - as if his job is just to know every crime that takes place.		A novel way to avoid the question at least...
Offord said "when you are the victim of a crime, you don't turn to politicians, you turn to the police".		That's true; and when politicians have caused the police to be wildly under resourced, they can't just ignore their part in keeping people safe.
Many residents feel increasingly unsafe, and this needs to be taken seriously.		As @Andrew_Dismore pointed out, less police, caused by cuts, leads to rising crime.		Meanwhile, the Tory council in Barnet hasn't even taken up City Hall's 2 for 1 offer on police.
Matthew Offord explicitly said it was "not politicians" that had a responsibility for the police; instead blamed the borough commander. 		Politicians decide resources &amp; funding. That Offord and the Tory councillors see themselves as in no way responsible for police is appalling.
Awful to see Matthew Offord throw the Borough Commander under the bus at the Mill Hill Preservation Society AGM last week.		The Tory government has slashed police spending. The Tory council has failed to increase police numbers in the borough.		When will they take responsibility? https://t.co/jZc2f1J2yu

Also this is maybe the first Shakespeare I've seen which was feminist in the sense of making more of the parts women than in the original text without seeming tokenistic and actually created a story where the women characters and the gender dynamics felt incredibly real.
