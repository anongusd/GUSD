BIDEN on 2020: "We are in the final stages of that decision.  But it would be the greatest honor of my life to be president of the United States.  But also it's something that I have to make sure I can run a first rate effort that I could do this."
Biden muses on 2020 -- and one consideration he has is: "This alleged appeal that I have.  How deep does it run?  Is it real?"

President Trump appears to remain committed to his "fight back" strategy as his defense against obstruction of justice.  He unveiled that in John Kelly's office in January.  Still says he sees it as "fight back" not obstruction.
Trump on whether or not he will go and speak with Mueller's team: "Nothing I want to do more because we did nothing wrong. . . but I have to find that we will be treated fairly.  Right now it is a pure witch hunt. . . If I thought it was fair, I would override my lawyers."

This sounds like @PressSec may be allowing some room for more facts to emerge in the future about whether it was known by anyone in the WH that Rob Porter was accused of spousal abuse: “I can only give you the best information I have and that’s my understanding”
Per FBI Director Wray: Partial report on Porter background check was submitted to White House in March and completed investigation was submitted in July. Follow up inquires from WH were investigated and results submitted to WH in November.

Can someone clearly state what exactly Chuck Schumer extracted from McConnell by shutting down the government?
In this statement, Schumer acknowledges that the shutdown didn't resolve the DACA fight as Democrats orginally intended. "We will continue to fight as strongly as we can in the weeks ahead for the DREAMers."
Schumer: "The Republican majority now has 17 days to prevent the DREAMers from being deported."
Schumer offers this shutdown justification over DACA: "And now there is a real pathway to get a bill on the floor. . ."
Schumer's shot at Trump before announcing he is formally folding: "The great deal making president sat on the sidelines."
Schumer: "The Republican leader and I have come to an arrangement.  We will vote today to reopen the government. "
President Trump also said "We’re going to fund our military."
President Trump: "If the country shuts down, which could very well be . . . the worst thing is what happens to our military."

Just in case you needed a little heartwarming moment tonight, here it is ==&gt; https://t.co/UJAlGLxR8s
Can someone please explain McCain's line of questioning to me?  I'm confused.
Comey on his firing: "There was an explanation.  I just don't buy it."
Just a reminder from the exit polls: 64% of the electorate said Trump was not honest/trustworthy -- and 20% of those voters voted for Trump.
Comey just pointed to what he believes are two falsehoods in Trump's interview with NBC's Holt and one in his May 18 press conference.
Comey: "I never initiated a communication with the president."
Good bookings =&gt; https://t.co/daBvtvOT59
Comey: "That was kind of a slightly cowardly way of avoiding telling him ‘we’re not going to do that.’"
Comey on 2/14 mtg: "I was so stunned by the conversation that I just took it in. . . was playing in my mind ‘what should my response be?’"
Comey: "Lordy, I hope there are tapes"
Comey on Trump's hope to let Flynn investigation go: "I took it as a direction.  This is the president of the united states with me alone"
Comey confirms that the @realDonaldTrump was not under investigation while he served as FBI Director. "That's correct," Comey says.
Comey on Feb 14 Oval Office meeting: "I remember thinking this is a very disturbing development, really important to our work"
The former Director of the FBI has now repeatedly expressed concerns that Donald Trump and his administration are liars.
Comey on why he felt compelled to document convo with Trump: "I was honestly concerned that he might lie about the nature of our meeting"
I guess the Senators are going to have use some of their 7 minutes to read large chunks of Comey written testimony since he chose not to
Comey: "The Administration then chose to defame me and more importantly the FBI"
Comey on the fallout from his firing: "The shifting explanations confused me and increasingly concerned me."

Obama: "I thought things would be a little more quiet for me after I left office for at least a year."
FPOTUS Obama may not have said @realDonaldTrump's name, but he is clearly giving a speech in Canada aimed at painting an alternative vision.
Obama: "Those of us who believe in those values and believe in democracy have to speak out with conviction."
Obama: "Those of us who lead democratic governments. . . have to strive to set a good example at home."
Obama: "I'm convinced the future does not belong to strongmen."
Jared Kushner should take note, the last guy President Trump observed had become more famous than him got fired. https://t.co/mw8z6w5iwE

TRUMP: "There was no collusion. . . Even my enemies have said there is no collusion."
Trump touts Rosenstein's very strong recommendation on Comey firing - last week he told NBC he was firing Comey regardless of memo.
Trump: "Because, believe me, there’s no collusion. . . Russia is fine."
Trump on Special Counsel: "I respect the move, but the entire thing has been a witch hunt."
Rubio saying an expression many GOPers will say for months to come: "All those matters are now in the hands of former Director Mueller."
Per McCaskill, Rosenstein said he knew Comey was going to be fired before he wrote his memo.
Does it seem Trump is taking a page from Clinton playbook -- painting special counsel investigation as partisan politics??
GRAHAM: I would suggest to the president. . . honor that decision, cooperate when it is appropriate, fight back when you can . .. .
GRAHAM says it seems that with Mueller appointment, this has moved from counterintelligence investigation to criminal investigation.
GRAHAM: "One of the big losers in this decision is the public." Goes on to say that opportunity for Comey public testimony may be lost.
GRAHAM: "Congress' ability to conduct investigations into all things Russia has been severely limited."
RT @jmartNYT: Holds up https://t.co/jdk3DhZUaw
@jmpalmieri why would you do that??
Chaffetz tells @GStephanopoulos that he really doesn't see any reason Comey shouldn't be able to testify-even with special counsel in place.

McMaster: "The president, in no way, compromised any sources or methods in the course of this conversation."
McMaster: "It was nothing that you would not know from open source reporting as a source of concern."
McMaster doesn't confirm or deny that Trump revealed the name of a city in his conversations with the Russians.
RT @gelles: McMaster: "He [The President] made the decision [to release the classified intel] in the context of the conversation"
McMaster can't explain why Bossert had aides reach out to NSA and CIA in the aftermath of Trump sharing intel with the Russians in the Oval
McMaster: "What the president discussed with the foreign minister was wholly appropriate to that conversation."
McMaster plays up Trump's preferred narrative about the leaks being the primary issue/problem.
McMaster: "I stand by statement yesterday.  What I am really saying is that the premise of that story is false.” -- so not quite standing by
Pelosi calls Trump's sharing of this intel with Russians "outrageous."  She said if he did so unwittingly, it's "pathetic and dangerous"

Clinton said Comey letter and wikileaks "raised doubts in teh minds of people who were inclined to vote for me and got scared off."
Clinton: "I was on the way to winning. . ." but for Comey and wikileaks.
After saying she accepts responsibility and acknowledging an imperfect campaign, Clinton clearly places blame for loss on Comey &amp; wikileaks

As points of comparison - Bush won 271 electoral votes in 2000 and 286 electoral votes in 2004.
Far and away, the candidate quality voters were seeking was a candidate who can bring needed change - 39% of the electorate wanted that.
NATIONAL EXIT: Clinton qualified to be president? 52% yes, 47% no.  Trump qualified to president? 38% yes, 61% no.

Sanders camp says no final decision yet on asking for MO recount -- "We are assessing right now how the process works"
Sanders camp's Devine: "One of the reasons we didn't do as well in Florida yesterday - independents couldn't vote in that process."
Tad Devine on what he sees for the Sanders campaign going forward: "A lot of room to grow. A lot of opportunity to win."
Devine says Sanders campaign will pick up "dozens" of delegates as caucus process goes from tier to tier in those states.
Tad Devine argues the nomination process is dynamic - not static.  Example: caucus process when delegates get assigned down the road.
Sanders campaign points to Arizona, Wisconsin, and New York as big showdowns to come in the Clinton vs. Sanders race.
Sanders campaign notes that Sen. Sanders had his best southern performance to date in North Carolina yesterday.

That Sanders moment on Bill Clinton may have been his best moment of the debate.
Sanders: "I’m disappointed that Secretary Clinton’s campaign has made this criticism.  It’s a Republican criticism."
Clinton: "I have the greatest respect for Senator Sanders and for his supporters.  I hope to have their support when I am the Dem nominee."
Sanders brings it back to his core message: "The real issue is the Congress is owned by Big Money."
Clinton: “This has been the fight of the Democratic Party for decades.  We have the Affordable Care Act -- let’s make it work.”
That was Bernie Sanders’ thank you note to Gov. Shumlin for his Clinton endorsement.
Sanders defense of his healthcare proposal is much stronger than his evolving position on guns.
Sanders “We are not going to tear up the ACA, I helped write it.  But we are going to move toward a Medicare for all system.”
Clinton: "I’m not sure whether we are talking about the plan you just introduced tonight or the plan you introduced 9 times in the Congress"
Sanders on Clinton campaign attacking for what they call his desire to dismantle the ACA: "That is nonsense."
@chucktodd just as the Clinton Camp wanted it, I’m sure.
Clinton: “We ned to move away from treating the use of drugs as a crime and, instead, move it to where it belongs --as a health issue."
Sanders takes a page from the Trump playbook to tout his polls - chapter and verse

The biggest applause line may go to Cruz’s pledge to have his DOJ open an investigation into Planned Parenthood
Cruz mentions he attended Harvard Law School. . . in order to ding Harvard Law professors
“transmogrified" is not a word you often hear elsewhere on the campaign trail.
Cruz: “We will end sanctuary cities.” (biggest applause line thus far.) Cruz pledges to cut off federal funds to any sanctuary jurisdiction.
On what he would ask a potential SCOTUS appointee: "I don’t care what they say, I care what they’ve done."

Cruz: “The chances of any litigation proceeding or succeeding on this is absolute zero.”
Trump on why doing the birther thing now: "Because now he’s doing a little bit better. . .he’s got probably a 4 or 5% chance."
Trump: "I don’t care.  I think I am going to win fair and square."
Trump: “But I was born here — big difference"

Perry makes a “white out” reference. . . hipster retro — perhaps, like the glasses.
If you have ever wondered why Lindsey Graham is running for president - wonder no more, he has clearly answered that question tonight.
GRAHAM: “If I am president, we are going to send soldiers back to Iraq and Syria. . ."
GRAHAM: "You want to see a war on women? Come with me to Iraq and Afghanistan. . ."

Is Santorum’s "20/20 perfect vision for America” the “9-9-9” of this campaign season?
Pataki: "I would not place one American life at risk unless it was absolutely necessary, but to destroy ISIS it is necessary."
GRAHAM: If you don’t understand that America needs more ground forces in Iraq. . . then you are not ready to be Commander-in-Chief.
How much time will Donald Trump get in the next debate to respond to the attacks from this debate?
Perry hits Trump on celebrity and single payer healthcare.  Fiorina hits Trump on Clinton phone call, foundation giving, senate donations
Fiorina: "I didn’t get a phone call from Bill Clinton before I jumped in the race.  Did any of you get a phone call from Bill Clinton?"
Perry on Trump: "How can you run for the Republican nomination and be for single payer healthcare?  I ask that with all due respect."
Pataki touts being “out of office for a while” as a selling point for his candidacy.
Fiorina: I know more world leaders on the stage today than any other candidate with the possible one exception of Hillary Clinton.
