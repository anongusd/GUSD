Deal: Tailings are the left over rock after copper has been removed during the #mining process.
Deal: RCM needs 4-6 square miles of land for tailings storage area. Scoping process looks at lands meeting geotechnical requirements.

Want to see the #ResolutionCopper Senate hearing for yourself? Go here: http://t.co/UWLy0b9G
Mr. Lewis says once land is transferred to #ResolutionCopper , Ag Secy can have little impact on behalf of San Carlos tribe
Cherry says #ResolutionCopper will be prohibited from harming Apache Leap
Cherry says #ResolutionCopper already has banked 50 percent of its water needs for the anticipated life of the mine
Cherry says #ResolutionCopper has no problem with NEPA; certainty of land exchange will give the company confidence to go forward
Cherry says #ResolutionCopper did not oppose pre-exchange NEPA earlier, but passage of time has changed the economics
Sen. Franken asks why #ResolutionCopper supported pre-exchange NEPA b4 but not now.
Sen. Franken says creating jobs, having strategic minerals is a good thing, but must be done responsibly
Cherry says #ResolutionCopper would still be required to conduct a full NEPA study
Sen. Franken asks Jon Cherry why #ResolutionCopper land exchange should be a special case
Sen. Franken says #ResolutionCopper land exchange concerns him
Mr. Lewis says #ResolutionCopper is a private enterprise, tribe wants to meet govt-to-govt, not with a private enterprise.
Sen. Murkowski asks Mr. Lewis about Sen. McCain's comments about lack of willingness of San Carlos tribe to meet w/ #ResolutionCopper
ASARCO has been waiting for administrative land exchange for 14 years, says Cherry of #ResolutionCopper. The risk is real.
Cherry says #ResolutionCopper wants the certainty of a completed land exchange before proceeding with investment
Cherry says there's no environmental impact from exchanging property. NEPA study is required b4 mining, not b4 exchange #ResolutionCopper
Cherry says #ResolutionCopper needs the certainty of a land exchange to proceed with multibillion dollar commitment
Cherry says under NEPA, #ResolutionCopper will submit mine plan of operations to Ag Secy, who can modify the plan
Jon Cherry says #ResolutionCopper project is technologically, economically feasible; will submit mine plan of operations this year
Mr. Lewis of San Carlos tribe says #ResolutionCopper land exchange would decimate a holy place
Mr. Lewis of San Carlos tribe says #ResolutionCopper mining techniques could cause Oak Flat to collapse into the earth
Oak Flat, part of proposed #ResolutionCopper exchange, is sacred to San Carlos tribe, Mr. Lewis says
Mr. Lewis of San Carlos says tribe opposes #ResolutionCopper land exchange
Cherry says a complete NEPA analysis of the #ResolutionCopper project will be done; it's a requirement
Under land exchange, #ResolutionCopper would receive 2,422 acres, give 5,300 acres to the government
#ResolutionCopper supports House Bill 1904 on land exchange
#ResolutionCopper 's Jon Cherry now testifying
Forest Service rep says Apache Leap land would be protected from #ResolutionCopper mining operations under existing laws
Sen. Murkowski says bill seeking pre-exchange NEPA study would add time, cede congressional authority. #ResolutionCopper
Forest Service rep notes that pre-exchange NEPA study could add two years or more to #ResolutionCopper land exchange
Murkowski asks how long process would be extended if NEPA study were required b4 land exchange is completed #ResolutionCopper
Forest Service rep says Congress has authority to determine public interest on land exchanges like #ResolutionCopper
Forest Service rep says #ResolutionCopper mine operation plan can be modified by Ag Secy b4 mining commences
Administration rep, Mr. Farquhar, says Depts of Ag, Interior want to ensure fed govt interests are protected at #ResolutionCopper
Forest Service wants to reconcile House, Senate efforts on #ResolutionCopper land exchange
Forest Service wants a NEPA in advance of the #ResolutionCopper land exchange
Mary Wagner of Forest Service is now testifying on #ResolutionCopper land exchange
#ResolutionCopper House legislation is good, should be supported by Senate, Kyl says
No reason for Congress to cede approval of land exchange to Ag Secy, Kyl says. #ResolutionCopper
Congressional process on land exchange is transparent, Kyl says. #ResolutionCopper
Kyl says exchange will protect and add 115 acres of land to Apache Leap, which is important to San Carlos tribe. #ResolutionCopper
Kyl says #ResolutionCopper will give environmentally important land in exchange for the land it seeks.
Sen. Kyl says #ResolutionCopper is third-richest copper deposit in the world
McCain says #ResolutionCopper is an opportunity that shouldn't be squandered.
People hurting in AZ, McCain says. Jobs are critical. Nation, state need #ResolutionCopper .
McCain says 25 percent of U.S. copper supply can come from #ResolutionCopper .
