The 1916 World Series game that went 14 innings between these two franchises was 2 hours and 32 minutes.  The first 14 innings of this game more than 6 hours.  The ads on TV back then must have been much shorter.
I wonder if prior to Game 3 of the World Series the @Dodgers office took calls from fans asking: How long are your games? No...just us?

Saints Lose 12-4, But Magic Number To Clinch Playoff Berth Drops To Four https://t.co/eDw68dF8nc https://t.co/ebbEi5XRNX
Wait, wait yes they ARE allowed to shoot off fireworks after the game here in Chicago.
Lose 12-4.  BUT did we mention our Magic Number to clinch a playoff berth dropped to 4.  That has to count for something.
Trail 11-4 top 8.  But remember our magic number did drop to 4.  We're trying to keep a positive outlook, so unlike us on here.
Solo HR Justion O'Conner, his 15th of the season, and cuts the deficit to 8-4 B6. Saints manager George Tsamis was prophetic, yes that word was PROPHETIC, saying at beginning of season O'Conner would hit 15 HR's. Nothing pathetic about that.
Down 8-3 Top 6.  BUT and here is where we go glass half full so be prepared.  The magic number to clinch a playoff berth has just dropped to 4.
Trail 8-3 Top 5.  Now seems like a good time to go wander around Chicago and check things out.
Wild pitch scores @kbarrett_4, who extended his hitting streak to 21 with a single, trail 4-3 B3.  And if you think us mentioning the hitting streak is going to jinx him for his next game, let's be honest if we had those kind of powers we wouldn't be running a Twitter account.
Trail 4-2 Top 3.  The @bigten offices right across the street from the ballpark here in Rosemont.  It'ss been a fairly quiet off-season for them.
2-run HR @this_is_BS21 tied 2-2 T2.  It's weird the Saints encourage us to wear a black cat suit whenever we want.

Up to the second playoff race watch.  Increase our lead for a playoff spot to 4.5 games with 11 to go as @FMRedHawks loses G1 of DH to @railcats. Of course, that also means our lead in the North has been cut to 1.0 game.
RBI groundout by @murph_max uo 1-0 B3.  Favorite time of year where people go watch a cow give birth, walk 50 feet &amp; eat same thing they just watch being born. The true circle of life. Although, extra points if you eat the burger while watching the cow give birth. #MnStateFair

Lead 5-2 T3.  $9 million winner take all for a round of golf.  Makes the $10,000 we gave away seem like pocket change.  Maybe we should up the ante. We're not going to get fired for saying something offensive on here, it's going to be because we try to give away money.
RBI 1B @murph_max, 2-run 1B @kbarrett_4 (extends hit streak to 18), lead 5-1 B2.
2-run HR @this_is_BS21 lead 2-0 B1.  That's 8 straight games for the Saints with a home run.  At this rate Mark Scott will be the new play-by-play broadcaster for the Saints.  1% of people will get this reference without looking it up.
Best wishes to @Chris_Grayson3 &amp; the @canaries organization. Chris was struck in the eye by a foul ball while in the dugout last night and is at the University of Minnesota Medical Center.  It's moments like that you realize this is just a game.  Here is to a speedy recovery.

2-run HR @TheIronTeddy ties game at 4 going to B5. Seriously, if someone has a crystal ball and can tell us how this playoff race is going to end it will save us a lot of anxiety. Whoever said "The journey is more important than the destination" never went through a playoff race.
Dante Bichette Jr. extends hitting streak to a Saints season high 20 games (ties career high) with an RBI 1B. Trail 4-2 B3.
6 straight games with a homer as Justin O'Conner goes deep this time (2nd in as many games) ties the game at 1 going to bottom 2.  We were the secret team that put in a claim on @Bharper3407.
Trail 1-0 Top 2.  @SmashingPumpkin playing across the parking lot here in Sioux Falls.  So they went from the Twin Cities to Sioux Falls.  You make your own jokes, it's just too easy.

Add 2 more home runs to the night, solo shots by Justin O'Conner &amp; @murph_max, 5 on the night a new season high. Lead 8-2 B7.  Apparently we practiced launch angle on yesterday's off day.
Lead 6-2 Top 5.  Wait, there are still music videos?
Home run derby continues, @this_is_BS21 hits a 3-run HR &amp; Bichette Jr. hits his 2nd of the game, a solo shot, lead 6-0 B3. We've hit 22 home runs in the last 11 games.  No jokes here that fact is good enough to stand on its own.

RBI 1B @this_is_BS21, then a wild pitch scores Shoemaker and on the same play a throwing error by the catcher back to the plate allows @JakeQs_av to score to tie the game at 5 going to bottom 8.  The game of baseball will give you heartburn if you let it.  We let it.
RBI 1B @kbarrett_4 tied 2-2 top 6.  So there ISN'T a rule that says we can't score more than 1 run in the U.S. Steel Yard.
RBI groundout @Matt33Snyder trail 2-1 going to bottom 4.

No score B2 in the resumed game.  Also, it appears as though our tweet from yesterday ruffled 6 people's feathers (we know right). More than 150 people liked it, but in honor of those 6 people we will bring you all the amazing things about Gary throughout the day. https://t.co/K2dexbyQb4
@BenLampron Correct.  9 innings for the resumed game and 7 innings for the regularly scheduled game.

4-1 bottom 8.  It's Friday, the app is out partying for the weekend. https://t.co/VfZZpofa9U
Wild pitch scores a run lead 4-1 bottom 6.  Lots of talk about millennials in our timeline today.   Who knew so many people out there would come to their defense?  Also, next year we may do a promotion allowing people to complain about everything that offends them.
2-run shot by Dante Bichette Jr., wild pitch scores Anthony Phillips, lead 3-0 B3. I know @twitter was purging followers, but to go from 27,000 followers to 1 really gives us a sense of who are followers really were.  I guess burner accounts follow other burner accounts

Win 9-2. 4 in a row.  Improve to 29-23. 4 home runs for the first time since 7/15/17.  @this_is_BS21 with 2, @kbarrett_4 first in 2 years &amp; 3rd of his career, and @Matt33Snyder his 1st in Saints uniform. @thenatural515 1st Saints pitcher to go 7.0 IP since 6/20. https://t.co/lK3lFAZ4IN

Wild pitch scored @No_reGRETZ_25 and @this_is_BS21 goes deep AGAIN, 3-run HR, lead 9-2 B7.
Solo HR's by @this_is_BS21 &amp; @Matt33Snyder lead 5-2 B6.  These are the nights we want to wrap our arms around the @Twins and tell them everything is going to be OK.  We've been there. We feel your pain.  Please be kind to them. They will give you info when they have it.
2-run HR by @kbarrett_4, the 3rd in 256 career games, gives the Saints a 3-2 lead going to bottom 5.  When is someone going to do a story on us being a self made hundredaire
Trail 2-1 Top 5.  And to think we had our Emmy speech all prepared. Another year we go home empty handed.
RBI 1B by @Wally_wazz tied at 1 going to Top 4.  More people were in line to get a build-a-bear than at Major League games in TÃ∂aÃ∂mÃ∂pÃ∂aÃ∂ Ã∂OÃ∂aÃ∂kÃ∂lÃ∂aÃ∂nÃ∂dÃ∂ Miami.  Of course the crowd acted like baseball fans do during $1 beer night.
Trail 1-0 B2.  It's 100 degrees here in KC.  Wonder if the @tbonesbaseball received calls from their fans asking if the game was cancelled because of the heat index?  We're betting they didn't.  You know why Minnesotans? Because baseball is played in those conditions.

2-run HR @murph_max lead 8-3 bottom 6. Do people in Fargo go crazy about the movie Fargo each time they watch it, like people go crazy about Space Jam when they realize Bill Murray is wearing a Saints hat?
GIDP by Anthony Phillips scores a run lead 6-1 B3.  The 4th of July, a chance for so many in the Midwest to take the vacation to far off exotic places...oh wait everyone just goes to the cabin.
RT @MaryCKenn: @StPaulSaints @murph_max Clearly you have missed the best parts of Fargo.		https://t.co/ncjYeC6fSH
RT @jeremykasperson: @StPaulSaints @murph_max Downtown is a fun place too.
2-run single by @murph_max lead 5-1 top 3.  Just 2 days in Fargo, not long enough.  I mean all we've seen is the mall, NDSU, the Fargo Dome, and the ballpark.  OK, so we've seen it all you're right.
3-1 Top 2.  Entire front office has the day off, lounging around doing nothing after having one home game in the last week.  They are tired. Please feel bad for them.
3-run home run by Reynolds, lead 3-0 B1.  There is nothing we would want to eat 74 of in a month, let alone in 10 minutes

5 runs in the top of the 9th to take a 7-6 lead.  9th inning 2nd highest scoring inning by the Saints this season.  We will now petition the league to start every game in the 9th.
Trail 6-2 Bottom 7.  We'll just leave that there since we're not really having fun right now
Trail 3-2 Bottom 6.  This game moves a little faster and we can party it up in Downtown Fargo before it closes at 9:45.
Solo HR by Reynolds ties the game at 2 going to bottom 5.  Note to self, never get a fish pedicure.
So it was that easy. Justin O'Conner solo home run, trail 2-1 B4.  Alexa how can I get $1,000,000? https://t.co/jVouWTfshF

RBI 1B Noah Perio Jr. trail 4-2 bottom 7.  July 1, the day all our former employers pay us nothing and are happy we're no longer with them.

A Roller Coaster Of Emotions Wrapped In A Win, Saints Get 6-5 Victory In 12 Over Goldeyes https://t.co/YBgdQlpvD0 https://t.co/w1S0zYX4jq
We may battle between the white lines, but we're family in every other way.  Baseball is a tight knit community.  Have to look out for one another.  Hoping for a speedy recovery for @K_Garci30. https://t.co/kO1pA8zQRA
Dear @Wpg_Goldeyes we both used our entire bullpen, both of us are listed as TBA tomorrow, unless we're bringing fans out of the stands to pitch tomorrow, how about we skip tomorrow's game, grab a couple beers and play a doubleheader the next time we're in town?
It took 12 innings and 4 hours and 14 minutes, but in the end we win 6-5. Improve to 22-19 on the season. If you see us curled up in the fetal position on a street in Winnipeg tonight just pat us on the head and keep moving. https://t.co/qUcXSUZeQ3
And @murph_max with an RBI double puts us up 6-5 bottom 12.  We're going to be sick.
And we're tied at 5 going to the 12th.  Enter your favorite curse words here.
Solo HR by Justin O'Conner gives us 5-4 lead going to bottom 11. The roller coaster of emotion is real.
In a Willis Reed moment @K_Garci30 comes back on the field on crutches to the @Wpg_Goldeyes dugout.  We may be on the other side of this if it motivates his team, but we don't care.  Just glad to see him out there.
Never, ever want to see this.  Thoughts, prayers to Kevin.  Baseball is secondary when something like this happens.  Hoping for the best. #Respect https://t.co/6gvoW1emse
4 runs in the bottom of the 8th had us down 4-2, but two RBI groundouts in top of 9th tie it up.  We're going to leave this here for now. Tomorrow we reserve the right to say some things about the runs in the bottom of the 8th inning.
RBI groundout Kes Carter lead 2-0. B3. Is avid soccer fan upset at all the casual sports fans jumping into the World Cup &amp; making comments on Twitter?  Asking for our 3 soccer followers (had 4, but our last soccer joke angered &amp; they unfollowed us).
Solo HR by Burt Reynolds lead 1-0 B2. So let's get this straight, when it snows down south in winter, Minnesotans make fun of those people for not being able to handle it? Yet we complain when it's 90+ degrees. Something tells us those down south are having fun at our expense now

RBI 1B @murph_max, passed ball gives us an 8-6 lead going to bottom 9.  If we don't make it through this game tell our one fan we love them.
RBI 1B by @RPrigatano tied at 6 going to Top 8.  If this game goes extras there will be an apology showdown between the team from MN and the team from Canada per league rules.
RBI groundout by Burt Reynolds, his 5th RBI of the night, trail 6-5 Top 7.  Former @Braves pitcher John Smoltz played in the US Senior Open today. Meanwhile his former teammate &amp; our pitching coach Kerry Ligtenberg ate five donuts.  Same thing.
Trail 6-4 B5.  If we start a rumor that @KingJames is heading to the @Timberwolves along with @kawhileonard &amp; @Yg_Trece do you think anyone would pick it up?  Ya, us either
He's done it again. Burt Reynolds 3-run HR, now trail just 5-4 going to B4.  Fun to see all these people making Burt Reynolds jokes like they're the first to do it AND thinking they are original AND think they are funny.  Come on be better.
Solo HR Burt Reynolds cuts deficit to 5-1 B2.  Rumor has it if teams in @AA_Baseball are tied at end of season, playoff team will be decided on which manager was thrown out the fewest amount of times. Yep, that's a joke at you #SoccerFan. Don't @ us the 4 of you that follow us.
Trail 5-0 after 1 inning.  That sound you hear is the computer being thrown out the window, along with a chair, and anything not nailed down.  Other teams put gif's, we're moments away from a litany of curse words &amp; dealing with the repercussions later.

Trail 4-2 Top 6.  If an ostrich takes batting practice AND hits a home run, we'll rename our team.  If he takes BP and doesn't hit one out, then he is no hero of ours.
RBI 1B by Max Murphy, cuts the deficit to 3-2 going to bottom 5.  If a hippo uses his smartphone to hail a riding sharing service in Woodbury, we'll change our name
Down 3-1 Top 5.  Since the raccoon climbed that building, we've lost one pitcher to Mexico, another pitcher went on the DL, our best hitter had his contract purchased by the Mets &amp; our starting catcher just left the game with an injury. This raccoon is our version of a black cat.
RBI groundout by Dante Bichette Jr. trail 3-1 bottom 4.  If a giraffe does a standup comedy routine, we will change our name.
Rumor has it, if @EJMedina12 is correct with all his picks, the @MNUFC will give him $10,000. So generous of them. https://t.co/911Wtncame
Trail 3-0 Top 2.  Seriously, if an elephant is seen riding a skateboard down 5th Street, we will change our name.
Tip of the cap to the @TheChicagoDogs who made an announcement about George winning his 1,000th game.  Dogs manager Butch Hobson 2nd most wins in Indy ball history with more than 1200.  Classy move.

Solo HR by Justin O'Conner, lead 2-0 bottom 3. Has a twitter account ever been drafted in the @MLB draft?  We feel pretty good about going somewhere in the top 5 rounds. Lots of scouts have talked to us.

After that, all bets off. Destroy them.
For the 26th consecutive season we won't be going undefeated. Lose 10-5.
Firm believer that home team should always get their Opener.
Down 10-5 top 9.  Is this the money ball inning?

Two-run homer by Justin O'Conner and we're down just 10-5 now bottom 6.  I swear if we come back and win this game free beer on Opening Day.  Wait, we've already made a promise and it cost us $$$.  Free water from the drinking fountain for everyone.
Kes Carter hits a solo homer, trail 10-3 bottom 4.  It's like we've double-downed through 4 innings. Trailing by 7 and we're in the city of Gary.  Yep, that's smart rile up the locals in the first game of the season.
Trail 10-2 Top 4.  üí©üí©üí©üí©üí©üí©üí©üí©üí©üí©üí©üí©üí©üí©üí©üí©üí©üí©üí©üí©üí©üí©üí©üí©üí©üí©üí©üí©üí©üí©üí©üí©üí©üí©üí©üí©üí©üí©üí©üí©üí©üí©üí©üí©üí©üí©üí©üí©üí©üí©üí©üí©üí©üí©üí©üí©üí©üí©üí©üí©üí©üí©üí©üí©üí©üí©üí©üí©üí©üí©üí©üí©üí©üí©üí©üí©üí©üí©üí©üí©üí©üí©üí©üí©üí©üí©üí©üí©üí©üí©üí©üí©üí©üí©üí©üí©üí©üí©üí©üí©üí©üí©üí©üí©üí©üí©üí©üí©üí©üí©üí©üí©üí©üí©üí©üí©üí©üí©üí©üí©üí©üí©üí©üí©üí©üí©üí©üí©üí©üí©
Soooo....down 8-2 top 3.  It's too early in the season to want to throw things right?
2-run single by Kes Carter. Lead 2-1 Bottom 2.  Dreary opening day in Gary. So just a typical day in Gary.
Trail 1-0 going to top 2.  At this rate we'd give up 850 runs and score none.  If that happens, we're definitely going to be a little surly this year.

@shimmyshimmya Yes you can
Tonight's exhibition game has been called due to locusts, or a zombie apocalypse, or rain.  We're not sure.  You can exchange your ticket for any future non kids day exhibition game, so in 2019, 2020, 2021, etc.  OR any regular season 2018 game. Exchange at Saints box office.
Tell them @TWSaint sent you.  They will know what it means. https://t.co/XKU9OUJfGk
Should tonight's exhibition game get rained out, your ticket is good for tonight's @Twins game. Just show up to their box office with the Saints ticket, they'll accept it.  *This tweet not confirmed with Twins before send button was hit*
Yes, it's also raining in Hagerstown where our sister team the @ChasRiverDogs are being delayed.  However it is a lovely 64 degrees in Sun Valley, ID, where Batman himself, Adam West, used to live. More fun weather updates to come https://t.co/vFLbTrueqb

Trail 5-4 top9.  If sports are like a roller coaster then we just lost our lunch after giving up ta 4-3 lead.
2-run 2B @NHans12 lead 4-3 B8.  Insert 47 exclamation points and some ridiculous gif of someone jumping up and down.
E5 scores run lead 2-1 B6.  Spoiler Alert: GoT series finale will be called The Dragon and the Wolf. There will be neither dragon nor wolf.

Lead 10-7 B9.  If we lose, you may never hear from us again.  Please hold down the applause.
2-run HR @GoldGlover2B lead 10-5 B8.  MnDot announced a 4-year construction project for Interstate 35W. Wash, Rinse, Repeat
Lead 8-5 top8. Seriously, when a former pitcher on your roster is listed as "team security" what does that mean? https://t.co/TCLboCFJOX
RBI 2B @JonJonGould lead 8-3 B7.  Hypothetically speaking what would happen if we took over @twins Twitter account. Fired in 1 inning or 2?
Up 7-3 B5. Meanwhile at @CHSFieldStPaul staff &amp; volunteers pack backpacks while we make sarcastic Twitter comments. Know what you're good at
RBI FC @MitchDelfino44 up 5-3 B4. You can pay $10/month &amp; watch 1 movie a day? How will Hollywood pay Adam Sandler to make Grown Ups 3?
Sac fly @this_is_BS21, RBI 2B @GallasMaverick, sac fly @GoldGlover2B lead 4-3 T4.  Baseball games are only 3 innings long right?
E5 on ball hit by @this_is_BS21 scored run lead 1-0 B1.  If the game ended now, the @Wpg_Goldeyes would be mad cause they didn't bat
