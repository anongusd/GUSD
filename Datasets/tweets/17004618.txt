@GavinNewsom By the way, my big examination of the Kevin Cooper case, arguing that he was probably framed, is here: https://t.co/ePBMaU4JEq
@GavinNewsom We also need to think institutionally. We now have two governors in a row who have, within two months, ordered DNA testing in the case--but only after 35 years. Journalists can't champion every case. One lesson is we need easier access in appeals to DNA testing generally.
@GavinNewsom Gov Jerry Brown had ordered limited DNA testing in the case before he left office, but neglected crucial evidence (such as the hairs found clutched in the victims' hands). Newsom's new executive order rectifies that. A step for justice for a man who has spent 35 years in prison.

The world should bet on Saudi Arabia's future, not on MBS's: The future of the country is more represented by Loujain al-Hathloul, the imprisoned women's rights activist, than by her torturer. The royal family will decide when the king dies, and Trump shouldn't protect MBS.
Yes, the crown prince talks a good game about economic reform. But I'm skeptical that he will deliver, for his vision doesn't seem practical. In the meantime his war on Yemen and torture of women's rights activists is devastating to Saudi Arabia's reputation.
The crown prince repeatedly has shown himself reckless and a source of instability in the region: his war in Yemen, feud with Qatar, kidnapping of Lebanon's PM, and murder of Khashoggi. Why does Pres Trump continue to embrace a crown prince who breaks everything he touches?

President Trump is right that Iran is an oppressive, untrustworthy regime. But he meanwhile embraces another oppressive, untrustworthy regime--Saudi Arabia. The Saudis have also created the world's worst humanitarian crisis in Yemen. Mr. President, how about a word about Yemen?
I'm surprised that Trump sounds so trusting of the Taliban. I agree that we should try to negotiate a peace and a withdrawal, but the Taliban is not monolithic and we should verify more than trust. #SOTU
It's sad to see the Venezuela issue so polarized. Trump is right that Maduro has been a catastrophe for Venezuela, and that Guaido would be much better. Democrats should appreciate that. But Trump administration talk about military options is crazy and just helps Maduro.
It's true that North Korea hasn't conducted a nuclear test or missile test, and that's good. But North Korea is still producing nuclear materials and still making nuclear weapons, and it's also apparently ramping up its biological weapons program.

A welcome Trump call to try to eliminate Aids in the US within 10 years. Bravo. But to do that we need to expand Medicaid and health care coverage, even as Trump and the GOP have tried to do the opposite. Without expanding health coverage, we can't beat Aids.
I agree with Trump's call to address drug prices. But figuring out how to do so is complicated. It was a huge mistake for Congress to bar Medicare from negotiating with drug companies on pricing for part D; that was a gift to drug companies of about $50 billion a year.
Here's another thing Trump is right about: The need for a new infrastructure bill. Instead of spending money on tax cuts for the rich, we should have spent it on desperately needed infrastructure.
Trump says that any China trade deal will have to include "real, structural change" in China, as well as reduce the US trade deficit.
Trump is noting that there are more women than ever in Congress. Hmm. Well, in some sense that is a national achievement that Trump is partly responsible for.
Remember that a full wall would cost $22 billion.  If we want to improve American wellbeing, how about using that sum for child care, for parental leave, for drug treatment, for job training, rather than for a wall?
It's so hypocritical for Trump to talk about sex trafficking as a motivation for the wall. I've interviewed those girls who were trafficked in Honduras--and Trump insists on sending those girls applying for asylum back to the Honduran traffickers.
Now Trump is presenting undocumented immigrants as murderers who want to slaughter us in our beds. Actually, researchers find undocumented workers commit crime at lower rates than native Americans.
I spent 25 years reporting on sex trafficking, which indeed a huge issue. But It's offensive when Pres. Trump tries to use this issue to justify his wall; a wall won't help. If he wants to go after sex traffickers, his Justice Department should prosecute pimps more aggressively.
"This is a moral issue," Trump says of immigration. Look, the real moral issue is that the Trump administration separated children from immigrant parents at the border, lost track of who was who, and now insists that it doesn't need to try to find the kids it lost.
Oh, no, Trump is talking again about the "onslaught" from caravans of immigrants. This is of course preposterous. There is no threat to American well-being from some hungry hikers in Honduras trying to flee gang violence by going north.
Pres. Trump says he wants to put drug traffickers and human traffickers out of business. So why not spend the $5.7 billion on means to address this, such as searches of the trucks that carry drugs across at official crossing points?
One thing Trump is right to claim credit for: criminal justice reform. That was a genuine bipartisan achievement. Mass incarceration was one of the worst mistakes America made, and I hope we can continue with the criminal justice reforms (like change the bail system). #SOTU
It's not "hatred": it's "accountability." That's what happens in a democracy. Presidents get fact-checked. https://t.co/MLcCrmByNa
Trump boasts about cutting back on regulations. This is a genuine achievement, along with appointments of conservative judges. But some of the regulations make it easier for companies to sell dangerous chemicals, such as chlorpyrifos, which damages children's brains. #SOTU
Trump is boasting of cutting back on Obamacare. The upshot is that the surge in the number of people becoming insured has ended. And for every 800 people who lack health insurance, about one dies each year. #SOTU Lack of health coverage is lethal.
Here's a full text of the #SOTU: https://t.co/H1E8ZOLb9Y
It’s true that the economy is strong. Unfortunately, this was financed by borrowing (partly from China) to give a tax cut to the rich. We now have roughly a $1 trillion deficit that our kids will have to pay back.
A bit incongruous to hear Pres Trump in #SOTU  call for bipartisan cooperation and putting country first. Oh, yes, today it’s TelePrompTer Trump. His Twitter twin is in a secure location.
Looking forward to reading this. I have huge admiration for Richard Holbrooke as a tough minded strategist who made the world a better place, from the Balkans to his work on AIDS. https://t.co/h2t2tYM7Yi

The sight of UN delegates laughing at Trump is garnering the most attention, and that's understandable. But an elevated risk of a war with Iran--perhaps being dragged in by Saudi Arabia and UAE--is no laughing matter.
I was almost deeply uneasy about the virulence of Trump's attacks on Iran, seeing it as the root of all evil. Yes, Iran badly violates human rights, as do our allies Saudi Arabia and Bahrain. But demonizing a country increases the risk of a war, and that's the last thing we need. https://t.co/R2z3KNpuiZ

China in the past has protected others guilty of genocide, from the Khmer Rouge in Cambodia to Sudan's Omar Bashir in Darfur. Will China again shield a genocide, this time by Myanmar against the Rohingya?
Myanmar's military and Suu Kyi argue that any killing of Rohingya was incidental by rogue troops or villagers. But by sending the two journalists to prison, they show the hand of the state in trying to suppress truth. This was a state operation from beginning to end.
It's unfortunate that Suu Kyi's Nobel Peace Prize can't be withdrawn and awarded instead to U Wa Lone and U Kyaw Soe Oo for trying to blow the whistle on a likely genocide.
This is a good time to reread the extraordinary report by the two imprisoned reporters, U Wa Lone and U Kyaw Soe Oo: https://t.co/2alGrO4lf3 It's a model of outstanding and courageous journalism, the kind that should win prizes, not prison cells.

@fivetonsflax @lrozen oh, you're totally right. I'm mortified. No copy-editors to blame; just my mistake.
Some blame for the White House chaos on North Korea goes to John Bolton, who has a perfect record: Over the last 20 years on the big issues of Iraq, Iran and North Korea, he has been 100 percent wrong. Dangerously wrong. https://t.co/1lHbmGD8zB https://t.co/DVp3KvyvJQ
