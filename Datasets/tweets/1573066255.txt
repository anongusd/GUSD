@Tigerschweitzer @myang92221 @jojoh888 Yes Calo abortion is wrong and must be stopped. To be clear the wait till 12 comment was sarcasm for...abortions would stop if the victim had a voice. It wasn‚Äôt meant to be literal. It‚Äôs good we both agree abortion is horrible.
@MaddockLane @jojoh888 It boils down to, NOT emotionally harming the young person. We both agree on that. The difficult part is, not one emotional size fits all. Everyone is unique &amp; develops emotionally, intellectually, spiritually &amp; physically at different rates. Helpful or harmful depends &amp; varies.
@Tigerschweitzer @myang92221 @jojoh888 Each person should have a voluntary personal relationship w/God, prayer is vital.	We must stop abortion bc the party most affected by that ends has no voice. We should pass a law postponing the abortion allowing the fetus to voice their opinion regarding their abortion at age 12.

@MaddockLane @jojoh888 Lane, your intelligent AND you have a good heart. I‚Äôve read jojoh comments, has great insight and perspectives.
@MaddockLane @jojoh888 Lane is smart but Congress passed a bill yesterday that will address the ridiculously excessive overcrowding in our justice system. The new law made it clear that we in the US, are too often throwing far too many issues at the courts, when the issue can be reconciled otherwise.
@MaddockLane @jojoh888 Lane you are too smart to base a conclusion on looks &amp; appearance. Complex social issues need practical comprehensive understanding that can rise from open, honest conversation that involve calm public discussion w/contributions from ALL, for understanding, not social hysteria.
@leaclark1 @jojoh888 I am defending against bullying, rejection, repression of feelings and social panics. And support talking these issues out with trained UNBIASED mental health professionals. Why the hysterical social reaction of trying to make this a legal issue instead of a mental health issue?
@MaddockLane @jojoh888 I missed the ‚Äúadults pitching cash‚Äù part but as I‚Äôve said, the family should sit down with mental health professional to hash out these complex issues. Social hysteria, attacks, repression, rejection and bullying are issues mental health professionals could better negotiate.
No, I‚Äôm anti bullying and repression of feelings. It‚Äôs obviously an issue for councilers and family and adolescent behavior professionals to discuss with the family. https://t.co/rrA5osD1Xp
@MaddockLane @jojoh888 The family should speak with mental health professionals to get a better gauge on this issue. It‚Äôs well documented that repressing feelings, rejection and bullying are elements in this and unbiased professionals, trained in family and adolescent behavior would be recommended.
@HighlandReal @MacovitzGeary @jojoh888 Dancing is very arobically healthy and expressing ones feelings is also very healthy. Repression and rejection of emotions may do more harm than good. 	Both parents were present, no alcohol was served. There are under 21 clubs all over New York State, where is the broken law?
@HighlandReal @MacovitzGeary @jojoh888 Discussing this issue w/ the entire family, owner of the venue and unbiased mental health professionals would be better than repression.Repressing those feelings may do more harm than good. Rejection, repression &amp; over simplifying w/the word ‚Äúsick‚Äù are masked forms of bullying.

@shel_gold17 @emmacatt_ For 30+yrs, feminists groups have been colluding w/a Soros financed globalist media, in a mind conditioning agenda to weaken the USA, via the strongest link in the chain. Men. By exploiting mens sexual weakness, to destroy US men. Such that the void created, is filled by a woman.
@shel_gold17 @emmacatt_ To be perfectly frank here, we are talking about ADULTS. Unless society provides other outlets to a persons FINACIAL dilemma. Casting the social delinquency &amp; FAILURE of a RICH society on the sexually weak, is A CRAFTED MEDIA DISTRACTION FROM SOCIAL ACADEMIC FINANCIAL NEGLIGENCE.

@SaRaAshcraft Sarah that's almost the same vocabulary Islamic terrorists used on how to punish gays &amp; women who ignore Sharia Law.

@SaRaAshcraft Interesting. A yr ago I read an article on how Islamsits	were going after the legal low hanging fruit of crime in the US &amp; Europe.

@USAlivestrong @Bconsdr8 @TheGreatFeather @im2byteme @KLSouth @Tierrah46 @BillPeriman @blove65 @Patriotress @tomhanks Throwing out red herrings is one thing but from what I am hearing from some in our conversation is we should also throw out critical thinking, logic, rational thought, justice &amp; the Bill of Rights and go directly to the lynching tree.

@USAlivestrong @BillPeriman @Bconsdr8 @TheGreatFeather @im2byteme @KLSouth @Tierrah46 @blove65 @Patriotress @tomhanks That is true. Good ppl learn to correct. We have learned and grown to understand as human beings in America that justice is better than lynching.
@USAlivestrong @Bconsdr8 @TheGreatFeather @im2byteme @KLSouth @Tierrah46 @BillPeriman @blove65 @Patriotress @tomhanks My focus is fair justice for EVERYONE.

@USAlivestrong @Bconsdr8 @TheGreatFeather @im2byteme @KLSouth @Tierrah46 @BillPeriman @blove65 @Patriotress @tomhanks So you believe in guilty without a trial?
@SaRaAshcraft The founding fathers wrote the Constitution,  bill of rights, to judiciously counter the hysteria of  Salem witch trials and other paranoid accusations. My point is we have to be wary of our emotions in these bizzare accusations of extremely abnormal behavior.

@SparksViral @BeautiPlace As long as FORCE, an unwilling victim or if the victim had not reached puberty, that can be considered rape. But for the Netherlands to consider a kiss, rape. (Look it up.)	Abuses the definition of a horribly egregious behavior.
@SparksViral @BeautiPlace Some countries considered their people speaking freely and honestly to be the equivalent of rape. Freedom of speech had to be articulated in the Constitution because of the egregious mutilating punishments some governments would inflict on those who would criticize their rulers.

@katie_sado @BreitbartNews So laws don't work?	So we should do away with marital and workplace harassment laws, speeding laws, all abuse laws, breaking and entering laws?
