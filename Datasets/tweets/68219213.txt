We made major gains in 2018 because we had YOU by our side. We accomplished so much together. Here‚Äôs to 2019! https://t.co/dEV6zIqdzW
Top moment for 2018: @BetoORourke was just the beginning! He ran an unorthodox campaign where he swore off money from PACS, visited all 254 Texas counties to reach every voter, and live streamed everything from town halls to roadtrips. https://t.co/ahAMLWD3Ru
Top moment for 2018: We went on our Fair Shot for All Bus Tour with @LupeValdez, @CollierForTexas, and our statewide slate where we visited 38 cities in 10 days! We were out knocking on doors, called voters, text out the vote and reached voters from every corner of Texas. https://t.co/r4cdNYFtoM
