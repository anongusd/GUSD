Thank you @JoanAlker1 and @GeorgetownCCF for important report on children‚Äôs health care coverage in America and Florida. You have provided guideposts for how to stem the tide of lost coverage for kids and get back on track. #CHIP #Medicaid #ACA #KeepKidsCovered
Florida will never reach its full potential unless children and families are valued and policy makers act to ensure everyone has access to affordable health coverage. @JoanAlker1 @GeorgetownCCF @AmerAcadPeds @HealthNewsFL @wusf @CoveringFL @KHNews @FloridaPolicy @TBTimes_Opinion
Why is #Florida backsliding? Why are more children unable to see a doctor and get the care and coverage they need? üëâ It‚Äôs due to actions by the Trump Administration and Republican policymakers in FL and Congress: attacks on #ACA, failure to expand #Medicaid, cuts to outreach ‚òπÔ∏è https://t.co/oOnAWEt46C

Kavanaugh‚Äôs demeanor &amp; untruthful statements disqualified him from the Court in my opinion, but the President‚Äôs mocking of Dr. Ford was a new low. Many people have shared personal stories of assault &amp; trauma &amp; how much it pains them to see a courageous woman treated w/disrespect.
Everywhere I have gone over the past week, friends and neighbors across Tampa have wanted to share their thoughts on the treatment of sexual assault survivors. The Kavanaugh Supreme Court nomination generated many harsh feelings of disrespect &amp; anger.

Under current law, it's right &amp; legal for individuals fleeing persecution &amp; violence to request asylum in the U.S. Until recently, children of asylum seekers weren't separated from their parents.

I wonder if while his staff was going out to get the used bed if they picked up the Ritz-Carlton moisturizing lotion he asked for also. At least it‚Äôd be fuel efficient. ü§î
Now he‚Äôs using his staff to get used beds and wasting money on custom made pens. Yep, $1,560 of taxpayer $ for 12 pens! GOP seems OK with this. https://t.co/zmcM7WDW1B
Remember how former Rep. Schock (R) redecorated his office to look like Downton Abbey? Pruitt‚Äôs taken that to a whole other level. https://t.co/LhkLrvY8cH
Pruitt also seems to want to #MakeAmericaSickAgain by delaying, weakening, even reversing Obama-era chemical safety precautions! @EnergyCommerce
He abused his position to try get his wife with a fast food franchise. He settled for using his aides to get her a cushy legal job.
Pruitt has a penchant for reassigning staffers who don‚Äôt agree with his frivolous spending. https://t.co/wowHRkYSox
