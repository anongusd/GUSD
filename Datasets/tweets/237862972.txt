President Obama missed an opportunity tonight to rally the country around bipartisan solutions. #SOTU

Two weeks ago, the President’s motorcade drove right past the Phoenix VA clinic. Tonight, he offered no long-term vision to reform the VA.
We need a workable immigration policy. But unilateral actions that bypass the legislative process are unconstitutional and must be stopped.
Closing Guantanamo Bay is deeply misguided. It plays an important role in combating terrorism and keeping the American people safe. #SOTU
A strong America is a force for good. We need a new foreign policy strategy that recognizes that fact, not apologizes for it. #SOTU
America's enemies see a President who projects weakness &amp; lacks the resolve to confront the growing terrorist threat around the world. #SOTU
Raising taxes does nothing to help the millions of Americans being squeezed by an out-of-control Washington. #SOTU
I introduced bipartisan legislation with @RepDanKildee to help families save more money for education. http://t.co/NYKeY6XPC2 #SOTU

President Obama keeps his #SOTU streak alive with yet another tax hike proposal. 6 for 6. http://t.co/V3GTJub3mh
The President's community college plan will cost $60 billion over 10 years. It's only free until you pay for it. #SOTU
The average family’s income has dropped by $2,500 during President Obama’s time in office. Time for new solutions to boost wages. #SOTU
Millions of Americans lost the plan and doctor they were promised they could keep. What about them, Mr. President? #SOTU
The President gives lip service to domestic energy production, but threatens to veto the Keystone XL Pipeline. Enough delays, Mr. President.
I’m on my way to the House floor for the State of the Union. My staff will be tweeting for me during the President’s speech. #SOTU
