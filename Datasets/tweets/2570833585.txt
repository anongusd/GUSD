@KamalaHarris ok but what about the people who have worked there for a couple of years and now are at 15.00 is that fair to them that a new person can walk off the street and start off making what this person took lets say 2 years to get to . NO its not so then its not fair to other workers
@KamalaHarris How is raising it to 15.00 dollars going to help/ People that have worked for a couple of years at a company may now be receiving this amount. So then they deserve a raise a big one at that. It also tells kids look I can drop out of school and make good money no college for me

@fox5ny this I think the only 2nd time I agree with him. Cortez did serious damage to us without thinking because she thought she was the bomb. Bomb yes a ticking time bomb for the Democrats the worst is yet to come
@HillaryClinton What about our people first that live on our streets in all states . The vets that live on streets . People on streets that need medical attention first before other countries. Why is you and other help other countries first and let our Americans suffer
@KamalaHarris Really and how are you going to handle home invasions close to the border or stop @SpeakerPelosi from giving millions away to other countries when we need it here for our people first ? Among other issues beside guns, Drugs on streets killing children
See another Democrat running that wont make it far . hmmm https://t.co/pzddMDGfTV
How dare anyone call @PressSec  a liar .

@dachte @BillKristol really show me the proof
@Kddid15 @RWPUSA very true , you put a drunk person I a car and he hits a person . the person used that car as a weapon and hurt or even killed others. No your getting  it.
@dachte @BillKristol @realDonaldTrump First off it shows how disrespectful you are to wish harm on someone . That is just wrong . Would you like it if someone wish ill or death on your family ? no That just shows what type of person we are talking to. Not someone who is capable of having a adult conversation
@dachte @BillKristol he will win if Obama did it 5 times while in office for other countries and it was or billions . @realDonaldTrump  is doing once and for us Americans for our safety trust me he shall win with no problems he is first a business man
@winecat @RWPUSA that I wish we I had the answer to. they come from all areas of the world
@cjkinne58 @shiftms me too I dont qualify for it I have Medicare and Tricare for life . Military benefit
@TroyRos12854484 @Watchdogorg explain to me how the heck do they get help from the state which is our tax dollars being payed to the illegal immigrants they have no sscard here no birth certificate makes no sense
@dachte @BillKristol That was a question ? because of what I see is him wanted to build a wall for us for protection and Pelosi not wanting to give it him
@dachte @BillKristol It just shows that people in Texas love Trump and are for him building the wall period.Actually you can also count the3 men from different states that had collected over millions doing a gofundme for build the wall tells you something also but see the Trump made them give it back
@tlk19811 @MSNBC @NBCFirstRead Really show me proof than .
@winecat @RWPUSA also you just said guns dont kill people . people kill people and they will never get the guns off the street they come from all over the world to us and end up on the streets
@winecat @RWPUSA no guns dont kill people , you do not see a gun go off and shoot people . A person must pick it up and aim and pull the trigger so people kill people.That is why so many innocent children and people get killed during drive byes
@WizardofHaase @RWPUSA What about the retired military and retired police officers who have them already. the FBI the private security that protect certain people
@Kddid15 @RWPUSA That is good we all take good coverage out on our cars . But guns are different .It is not going to stop them from getting on the street. Anyone can go into Walmart and get a rifle and ammo with out a permit no questions asked. Guns dont kill people , people kill people.

@BillKristol the 5 year old sold hot chocolate in Texas for trump and the wall that tell you right there people love him and then he gave free marshmallows to melt for Pelosi again he raised 5000 for the wall enough said about Texas. Sorry these are parts. you only get amount of words to say
@BillKristol I just dont get it . only 2 other presidents have been impeached . Nixon . who resigned or he would of been removed for treason . then Andrew Johnson but he stayed his term . Trump has done nothing wrong but protect us the people . look at the 5 year old raised 5000 for the wall
@BillKristol First off @HouseGOP  will stay with Trump . the Democrats will stay with the Queen B . She had her chance she thought she won but didnt. Obama did it while in office 5 times a national Emergency for other countries nobody said or did anything. Trump does it once for us Americans
@WizardofHaase @RWPUSA yes you do and now our guns are registered with the county and state which they should be I also believe rifles and shot guns too. anyone can go into Walmart and by a rifle no permit needed and by ammo with no questions asked
@tlk19811 @MSNBC @NBCFirstRead sorry part 2 Obama used the national Emergency 5 times while in office for other countries while America suffers from so much more  look it up and the house of Senate didnt care
@tlk19811 @MSNBC @NBCFirstRead well see you think so and others do to . But then there are others that believe in him that doesn't make you or them wrong. Some who hated him changed and gave him a chance then liked him. Its like Obama I couldn't stand that man for anything he stood for .
@winecat @RWPUSA I agree to that totally . But it will never stop the guns on the street . Guns dont kill people. People kill people. We have done everything that the Gov has asked with no problem But some gun owners dont follow like felons they are not to have any weapons. so start with that .
@Kddid15 @RWPUSA well thats probably because you have a very expensive car because you have a great pay check. What about the retired marines or any branch or the retired police officers they dont have that kind of money. Cuomo needs to worry about all of NY not just NYC like it he does .

@CA49thDistrict @RWPUSA Thats not true at all. How can you label people like that . I know many republicans that are for woman's choice where it comes to abortion . except when the baby is like 6 to 7 months in the womb then she must carry it and give up for adoption . At that time the baby is moving
@RWPUSA Well over here if you got rid of Gov Cuomo or separate NYC and NY the gun laws would be fine but what Cuomo is doing in NYS is pissing a lot of people who are gun owners off like now trying to pass a 1 million dollar insurance policy to gun holders. Not fair
@tlk19811 @MSNBC @NBCFirstRead Yes he has and has always come out on top. He is first a business man so he knows the game all to well. He doesn't make a move without knowing the reaction of a outcome. He knows people hate him. They hated him for beating Hillary, But they never gave him a chance when he won
@ChrisHolladay64 @MSNBC @NBCFirstRead Not true Nixon had the most and then he was impeached for treason He would of been the first President to be removed form office but he resigned before they could. The other one was Andrew Johnson he had 11 articles against him. He was the first president to be impeached

President Trump is asking everyone to forward this email to a minimum of 20 people, and to ask each of those to do likewise.  In three days, most people in the United States will have the message. This is an idea that should be passed around, regardless of political party.

@RWPUSA @realDonaldTrump @GovBillWeld They have only impeached 2 presidents Nixon for being on for treason then he resign so his vice president to his place the other was Jackson years back he stayed . . So going by the 25th amendment with all parts he is totally fine
@RWPUSA @realDonaldTrump @GovBillWeld He will never be impeached and if he does he will stay in office then when the new president comes in he will have a pardon that protects him from state and government while he was president

@jdttriumph @JRubinBlogger @jbendery @realDonaldTrump Question but isnt there more democrat in house then republicans ? I am so lost with this If the house has more Democrats and Pelosi is one also shouldn't they have the balls to speak up there are more of them then republicans, Just a question?
@JRubinBlogger I still believe in @POTUS  and what he is doing . He is a business man first it is in his blood . We seem to forget that the Democrats and Pelosi failed at their jobs to bring something equally important to him , Not stuff he can use, They Pelosi runs by her hate for @POTUS notus
@Buckeye_Blue @RWPUSA how is that in this case . When there are more Democrats in the  house  under Pelosi . They had the choice of coming up with a better deal for the president but because of her hate towards him thats what led her thinking She rather send millions to other countries then care forus
@Streetrunner98 @RWPUSA he doesn't have to because if I am correct if he doesn't win again the new President gives him a Pardon which protects him from anything he has done in office, also state and government cannot go after him for anything . But please correct me if I a wrong
@LeedsBlack @RWPUSA oh yeah she did great . NYC lost a chance to help so many people to get a job get off welfare to help people get jobs that couldn't like our Vets or our disabled people she did real good she did so good she bragged about. She is a Time bomb that is going to blow under Pelosi
@paulgla @RWPUSA I dont believe Medicare should be the choice , It is meant for the retired who have worked for years before us who deserve it or the disabled who have worked and can no longer work . That is our right to have it we worked for years when you weren't even thought of
@RWPUSA @EatTheRichH8ers @realDonaldTrump I would take 4 more years of @POTUS  because Medicare doesn't belong to everyone it is meant for the retired or disabled only . Give them Medicaid like they are on now that we pay for with our taxes anyway
more for people , more jobs more money less homeless less welfare numbers, less unemployment numbers. but yet she chased them away and then she put it all over news and twitter how she won and chased them away .
(Amazon)that would of gave jobs to over25,000bring up the economy more for people .What's her name Ortiz so now 2 democrats in the office under Pelosi have done some stupid things but Omar has done 3 texting issues twice where she should resign from them. and now this up above
As they have said WE WOULD BE TAKING DOWN BY OUR OWN GOVERMENT FROM WITHIN now looks guys the democrats has pulled Pelosi and all the other ladies in white We Have Omar here with her background Terrorist .

@realDonaldTrump Go for @POTUS  I believe in you and for all you stand for . People dont understand you thats why they hate you like Pelosi and the other Democrats who would rather send monies to other countries before taking care of our own here in USA . MAGA
@loraliepaddock @PeteSouza Thats not fair to bash and put down people because of who voted for @POTUS . Thats like saying the same thing about @HillaryClinton or whoever else runs . To put people down doesn't make you or anyone else look great as a person
Just like all the other Democrats do the hoard the money and send it to other places because they can. Forget us the Americans who need it .
else where to others first why you ask ? because of you ask ? lets see Pelosi would say something like" to keep the other countries happy so no wars would be started" All the other Democrats favor her like a queen. @SenSchumer Bows to her because he also dislikes @realDonaldTrump
food pantries ( which are done by donations by real human beings who care for each other) Or put more funding into schools all around for education for our children to make all schools great .I can go on and on The house of Senet's has the money to do so .But yet you send it else
Neighborhoods in other countries ( while we have homeless shelters over crowded and buildings that can be renovated and made to be used for our own families, or even fix the issues I see on the news in the NYC of complex's with no heat or hot water) Or help replenish
all the new ladies in white the work under Pelosi all seem to think by sending millions of dollars to other countries for food ( while our own starve) money for medical ( while ours suffer from not getting coverage or denied and die ) or sending money to help rebuild homes and
Now do you see why need the wall. this gang might of made it over and killed some one you know or a child in cross fire or your mother ,sister . or house invasion, more drugs more guns , While Pelosi wants to send money to other countries but not ours. She and @SenSchumer  and https://t.co/MX5DNRdqtA
@washingtonpost Sorry part 2 of my other post Pelosi and Schumer and the other Democrats are sending Millions to other countries before our needs first why is that hmmm because they care more for other countries then our own fact they showed you the numbers so many times last nite where it goes
@washingtonpost I am all for the funding , We had 3 men that had go fund me accounts that raised over 10 million dollars apiece that @POTUS  told to give back so that tells you something right there. also All the other things below are a crisis but the Democrats are sending millions to other
@SenSchumer @realDonaldTrump You @SenSchumer  and Pelosi had many chances to protect us the people but all you wanted to do is take our money and give to other countries before oursto those who need it here like our Vets homeless to the elderly who have to choose food or medicine those are facts Iam for MAGA
@JRubinBlogger Told you all a storm was brewing because Pelosi let her hate for Trump come first. She didnt think of us the people first . The money she is giving to other places before us Americans is shameful .
Love my @POTUS  and @VP https://t.co/5z5oUT3bSk
@seryals @StandUpRepublic Puerto Rico is lucky we helped them with funding. We dont have to. They still to this day do not want to be part of USA so its on  them . Its a shame they keep turning it down , But yet we are always there to fund them when they need help ,
@RealJamesWoods she is useless and a time bomb glad she is a democrat
@Riiiiiiii1224 @jsabatojr @JohnCleese I wasnt attacking her religion , It was meant as Rules that have been the same for years and years how is it she can just come in and think it is ok to not take the American oath like every other person or go by the rules that everyone else has for years
@Damiannight1 @IngrahamAngle Even if it makes it to the courts he will still win because he can use  National Emergency because it states A situation beyond the ordinary which threatens the health or the safety of the citizens .

@SpeakerPelosi @realDonaldTrump Speaker Pelosi  you are so blinded by hate that this has come down to you not working anything out with the President now we know you don't care anything for us Americans.  Trump will get the money back from Mexico you will see
@mikeortiz123 @washingtonpost not @POTUS
@lisamurkowski rip .
agree do not take this deal if it is real. let the house of Senet's feel the storm . @POTUS is a businessman and does deal all day long . He is to smart for this. Trust me Take the Senet's pay let Pelosi feel it the shut down the government https://t.co/WuDfKX0J6w

@RyanAFournier I agree , My daughter had to do it to become a citizen of Sweden it is hard and paperwork . Before that it was visiting back and fourth with her husband. She had no medical so when she was pregnant she had to pay cash as they are one that gives free medical to all citizens ,
@BillOReilly No. Its the media putting out false news or picking and choosing what they want to post out of a story usually the bad stuff. Not enough Positive things in the news anymore like the shelters helping , Clinics helping people etc.
@KamalaHarris This happens to every color so lets not use the color card on this. Because if you are in a gang  you are of any color you are treated the same. If a white boy is driving in a nice car with loud music with his seat back and his hat on crooked the same treatment happens.
@Riiiiiiii1224 @jsabatojr @JohnCleese Me a racist ? by far. My point is We had things in place since our first President and now rules get changed like the OATH that every person has taken in office over years . How does one who lives in America get not to use our oath . Thats is not fair and is a fair question
@BrownlieChiro Why I said that was because the media as we know them are going to have a field day with crap like that
@Riiiiiiii1224 @jsabatojr @JohnCleese See you cant even hold a regular conversation without insulting someone. For your information I have PPMS if you dont know what that is look it up. Also this twitter only allows you a certain amount of words so I have to retwitt again and again. Show respect
@CBSNews @60Minutes Its always something with someone trying to go after the @POTUS  Just give up guys really he is and will make the 2020 @POTUS
@RobynLBarnett5 @IngrahamAngle @realDonaldTrump @senatemajldr I would also take the Senators pay away . Make Pelosi sweat . Its because of her hate towards @POTUS  why this is going on . She doesn't care about us at all why Her net worth is 14.6 million and Schumer too. They dont care
May they all RIP. all they prayers to they families of those who lost loved ones and are still trying to deal with this loss https://t.co/k9kGakJr2x
@JRubinBlogger I will keep blowing up your post every day until I see you do something else that is positive . Just because your a democrat doesn't mean you cant go against something you feel is wrong if you see it or hear it. @PressSec  tells it like it is all the time . You should be like her
@JRubinBlogger Or try talking about the issue of how one of the Islamic Senators got to change another law or rule changed that nobody is to wear hats in office but she got it to where she can wear her head wrap. But our own Military who fought for us cannot how is that fair? Thats not fair
@JRubinBlogger Or how about how 2of your Democrats wouldn't take the American oath which has been in place since George Washington. Because they are Islamic, so what you are in our America office and everyone else does so do you. That was wrong again Terrorist in office.
@JRubinBlogger Dont you have other news to follow like the 15th is tomorrow, Speaker of the house Pelosi better come up with something instead of her dislike for @POTUS or Senator Omar with her twice caught self should be resigning but Pelosi feels just to say sorry. No that is like a Terrorist
@TheHillReport @JRubinBlogger There are so many other things that you can be doing with your time then trying to make people hate @POTUS . Like the Islamic Senator that has been caught twice talking smack that should be made to resign. Pelosi just because she doesn't belong in her role, 15th is tomorrow so
@bluedgal @BibiBronfman @JRubinBlogger @POTUS She may be your president in your mind . But she never one nor would of made it with her scandal of 33 emails. @realDonaldTrump  could of had her prosecuted like he was originally but changed his mind. So as far as president she will never be one . But I respect your thoughts
@Riiiiiiii1224 @jsabatojr @JohnCleese I will tell you why because Pelosi is bringing the world down , Islamic Senator caught twice putting us down in texts and Pelosi does nothing but say make a apology . That should be a act of terrorist period thats it
@Riiiiiiii1224 @jsabatojr @JohnCleese Or how one Islamic woman again who came here to America land of free can get a rule change that has been the same way for year and years with no hats , have it change for her to wear her head piece . When our own military cannot wear their proper uniform is with their hats . HMM
@Riiiiiiii1224 @jsabatojr @JohnCleese Also Since George Washington has been President We have a American oath that every person in office takes. So why is that 2 Islamic woman get away in America our land that they came to get to not take our oath that everyone else has try that one.
@Riiiiiiii1224 @jsabatojr @JohnCleese See why do you have to start calling names do you think you are above us ? Uh No . Look up Pardon . Trump has done nothing wrong .
@shiftms follow the signs way back and not be a nurse and rub it off as something else
@bluedgal @BibiBronfman @JRubinBlogger @POTUS really well if has nobody has gone after him so it must be hear say . besides The media only posts what they want you to know not the whole story .There is a saying believe nothing of what you hear and only half of what you see .The media could have stories right now of democrats

@alkhciosbihadal @JRubinBlogger You said it . Hit the nail on the head with that one. Instead of watching her Democrats and whats they are doing from the inside . boy some people are just blind or have blinders on lol
@B_BNKS @JRubinBlogger So Totally agree I have sent so many twitters to her like that . What about the Islamic Senator that has been caught twice texting stuff about us Americans or how she wouldn't take our American oath that has been in place since George Washington
@JakeMusc22 @JRubinBlogger Really is that all you got to say. come back with something educational
@Dwobers @JRubinBlogger The only way it will back fire if @SpeakerPelosi  if she doesn't put any type of funding in the agreement for the wall which she already said she wasnt so thats where  your problem will lay. She is not thinking of us the people . But herself and the grudge she has against Trump.
@BucIGrl @JRubinBlogger I also thought it was less like 5.5  or something due to they have to go at least 70 ft down to stop from anyone from able to dig under the wall
@isheimpeachedy1 @Sunny_Day2222 @AceOfCrame @JRubinBlogger Or build some this year and some next year . But again It's Pelosi that thinks she is the queen of the hill and rules because she has a I dont like @realDonaldTrump thing so she is mind set on that and her KKK recruitment and not us the rea people
@JRubinBlogger He will finish the wall like he said . so everyone needs to get over it . He isnt going to do a government shut down . I hope he does something like takes Senates pay away or something stronger . All he is doing is making us safe .like 3 other presidents spoke about and never did
@PromoCop @JRubinBlogger you talk about cult members @SpeakerPelosi  is the ring leader of the ladies in white of the kkk and you all seen them at the meeting . Then you had one that is underfire for her stupid texting not once but twice and Pelosi just said to apologize really thats a terrorist in mist
@iConquerMS part 2 sorry but adding more green veggies and avocados  are good because they are all anti inflammatory things . I used to be a nurse thats the only reason why I know that
@iConquerMS I dont think fasting or eating a special diet helps . I have Chronic PPMS for 7 years and I dont eat fast food but never did . I gave up milk went to Almond milk and dont eat American cheese only imported cheese . Not a lot of bread which that I always did.
@pslmonich @R1ckBrandt @sjpusmc @StopBigMoney 2nd part sorry . oh not everyone deserves free health care . If you sneak over here to the USA and do not have a green card a valid SScard . No you dont and you should be brought back to where you came from and do it the right way  to come in the USA. My daughter did it in Sweden
@pslmonich @R1ckBrandt @sjpusmc @StopBigMoney I agree , Well lets see our vets already are covered by Tricare for life. but most are homeless. The others are on medicade which is state paid by our taxes anyway so leave them on that . Or like Sweden where my daughter lives you must have your green card to get free insurance
@BibiBronfman @bluedgal @JRubinBlogger @POTUS he has done nothing to be impeached nor broke any state laws or government laws that some of these of these people seem to think . Nor  has he broken any of the Amendment's that some think .
@BishesBrew @washingtonpost No its more about @SpeakerPelosi  giving in some. She rather see people suffer why ? She has millions her net worth is 14.6 million she doesn't care. So if trump is smart he will take Senates pay away .

MAGA https://t.co/BDbGnZ1WTo
@bluedgal @BibiBronfman @JRubinBlogger If You all think @POTUS  is such a liar then why hasn't he been impeached ? oh I see because nobody has anything better to do in their life then to hate on people and judge others . smh
@bluedgal @JRubinBlogger Not true look up the history of Democrats . They have many liars in office and we have the biggest one now @SpeakerPelosi . . We are already seeing issues with the Islamic senator with her hate twits going on
@JRubinBlogger hmmm she isnt wearing white. She is breaking  the code of the ladies in white of the kkk leader @SpeakerPelosi  isnt going to be happy with here
@realDonaldTrump You tell them Sir Love you
Really people or Democrats get a grip just another way to try to make the @POTUS  have a bad day . Get a grip and move on to your own Democrats like @SpeakerPelosi  and the ladies of white the KKK https://t.co/d3e74Ty1Gg
@R1ckBrandt @pslmonich @sjpusmc @StopBigMoney part so why do we have to give our right to give Medicare to everyone when they dont have the right nor have earned it.
@R1ckBrandt @pslmonich @sjpusmc @StopBigMoney Some illegals get cards and get our money which isnt fair so how do explain that ? Or explain why we the people who have earned the right to have Medicare one because we have retired and it is our benefit or we become disabled after years that qualifies us to have.
@PositiveWithMS Me too. I have to ask my husband everything from the day and what is happening today short term memory is shot . Chronic PPMS here
Agreed. Pelosi deff needs some fun with her own money of course with her net worth being 14.6 million she can take the whole group of ladies of white KKK group and her puppet Schumer too. the 15th is getting close tic tock tic tock Democrats https://t.co/YRdGp8UaJO
@jsabatojr @JohnCleese @POTUS part  2 I hate doing this certain amount of words. But what State crimes do you Think @POTUS  has done? Nothing here nothing in history if  you search .
@jsabatojr @JohnCleese Actually he Pardon from all Government and state crimes period look up president Pardon. How do you think all of the Presidents that did do things wrong got away clear because they get Pardon from all government and state crimes. By the way what state crime do you think @POTUS
@StopBigMoney this is a fraud not real meant only for democrats
this is a fraud I have taken 3 times last night and just now twice it askes if you are a rep or dem . you click yes to rep it send you to Demarcate info page saying your a demarcate not me by far dont take it look at if you are a Republican https://t.co/4vMm5tkick
@jsabatojr @JohnCleese every President gets Pardon from everything that took place in and before they took office. They are protected by law
@Patriot_2477 @JohnCleese I am very proud of him . It must be a Beat up @POTUS  day for haters or democrats . Well he made the votes in . So that says something , also I am sure there is much more stuff to talk abut like Pelosi and her KKK white ladies klan or just how about something else positive.
@jsabatojr @JohnCleese he will make it to 2nd term trust me
@MSNBC you will never make . If you lied once and tried to use the African American trick you will be looked at under a scope for other dirt and scandals shame on you
They have joined the military after they we kept by as slaves which is horrible to. fight for all our freedom they died for our freedom they have done everything and more They care and love for us as much as we do So it is a disgrace for someone to try to use that to climb. https://t.co/ZYgwOz2paU
with them to me we bleed the same blood,  its a shame what the world was and what it is still like in some areas . we are all the same to me I love you all , But I do have to say Your churches rock a lot more then ours I just wish ours and your could mix. Love @lynn21070
why try to use or be so fake to think you can get ahead makes me sick , I am white American , African Americans had is so hard before I was born , even when O was born on 1970 it was still hard for them they climbed and crawled to be where they are its a honor for me to be friend
Trump campaign slams Warren as ‘fraud’ https://t.co/7qBCYZSW3q
so part 2 so we know if men were to wear white there and our @POTUS  had worn white they would of called them the Mobsters or KKK klan . So why not name the ladies of whit the new kkk as Pelosi recruits her Klan . So what do you think
Ok guys and gals lets chat for a sec. during @POTUS speech we all seen Pelosi and the other demo wearing white. So I say call them the new ladies of white of kkk with the leader of Pelosi because they all follow her leader she clapped they clap. She stood they stood. @nd part to
@CarlaCoastalLib @TheDemCoalition @DonaldJTrumpJr @HillaryClinton should also join the ladies of whit KKK right nest to Pelosi as the second leader . Because that is what they are the new kkk all whie. If the Men came in like that you know they would b called mobsters or KKK. So now we have KKK ladies of white leader Pelosi
@CarlaCoastalLib @TheDemCoalition @DonaldJTrumpJr well lets See then @HillaryClinton should be in jail for confirmed 33 emails issues that she had. so before they think they can go after @POTUS they need to do go after all the others in office before him oh yeah that right they are protected of all doing by the next President.
@realDonaldTrump we love you keep going strong
@MgBenchjeweler @SpeakerPelosi I just told her above that she needs the money to buy more whit clothing since she is the head of the ladies in white kkk group. Because you know if the men did it, It would be all over Mobsters or kkk klan so if looks and walks and speaks it is.
@SpeakerPelosi You say you care but all you do is smile while you  gather your crew of ladies of white KKK and you are the leader , Schumer cant wear white so he is just your puppet . If men showed up lie that you know it would be the Mob or kkk. Get a grip Impeachment or resign much safer
@PressSec I just have to say I love you . I look up to you. You are his rock. You tell it like it is. I feel bad for any President that does not have you in their corner. Much love to you and your family . Always waiting for you to speak lol stay strong like bull. https://t.co/0NTtRjPdBb
@shelshele1 @JRubinBlogger but see so you understand where I am coming from. If all of them and I mean every single one from Trump down to everyone that was in that room could speak like you and I then maybe just maybe they would get somewhere . It is like all babies fighting in a room
@shelshele1 @JRubinBlogger very true but the meaning behind it is if it were a group of men wearing white and Pence and Trump then you know that @JRubinBlogger would be on top of it calling them KKK or mobsters. Instead of trying to find the good things in people like or Vets
@JRubinBlogger If they did of course . But what about we the people went through yours and other bloggers and reporters and others like the media who cause so much havoc on people and dont care lets see what they hide. I leave mine as a open book
rock on sir @VP go strong push forward we shall move on https://t.co/yAz4SX8l0t
@kylegriffin1 go @POTUS
@tictoc the head of te ladies in white kkk speaks . like a bug in your ear . useless words / 15th is coming soon she better be prepared
@mybaddreams2 oh ok sorry it showed up in mine because it had my lynn21070 in it lol
@JRubinBlogger See the of the ladies of the white KKK is sitting down showing no respect . What happens if another presidents win and she doesn't like him or her. She still going to behave like a spoiled brat with her little KKK party
@JRubinBlogger So lets talk about the India lady that would not take the American Oath the one that everyone takes in office how fair is that, What makes her so special? Or why is she allowed to wear her heard wrap but nobody else can hmmm I see big issue
@JRubinBlogger those are your words not everyone thins like you. Many standing ovations that night from everyone except the woman in white known as the ladies of the KKK with Pelosi as the ring the leader of the KKK. They only cared about ad stood up when he spoke about more women in the work.
@JRubinBlogger Just because Pelosi doesn't understand the real language he should have to change his speech or her . She should record it and have a tutor teach her the words
@JRubinBlogger The problem remains the head of ladies of the KKK Pelosi needs to be Impeached and out of her position period
@JRubinBlogger As te leader of the in white known as now the ladies of the KKK klan she is no different , As she uses @SenSchumer  as her puppet because he is a man and he cannot wear white due to the fact then he wouldn't be able to play in scary movies as some children have said as he came in
@JRubinBlogger Medicare should not be given to all. It is meant for Retired or disabled only . What is this world coming to uhg
@mybaddreams2 @michaelwild2198 @JRubinBlogger @POTUS Nothing in my year book ,my life is a open book always has . If you ask me a question and I will tell you anything . I believe that in life you have your word and your respect . if you lie you loose your word of trust and respect from others so its hard to regain it. So I am open
@michaelwild2198 @JRubinBlogger @POTUS How do you know? what do watch hi every move tap his phone follow him everywhere or do you have hard proof if so bring it to the news or just clam it up to another hater of @realDonaldTrump . I am all for him. He does what he says. May not be perfect but who is?.
@shelshele1 @JRubinBlogger part4 so sorry uhg . Any way all the woman in white . if they were men doing that they would be called KKK in a heart beat we all know that, It was disrespectful and Pelosi to do that There is other ways to do things to stand your ground but that no way Sorry for all the parts
@shelshele1 @JRubinBlogger part 3 so sorry. The young Spanish woman didnt care she sat down showed no response to any of the vets or the families who lost loved ones in the house invasions. My husband is a retired 20 year vet from the Marine Corps
@shelshele1 @JRubinBlogger sorry part 2 she also would take her oath on her bible only . This is America you should be doing what our country does not yours especially in office.. also if you notice Pelosi wore white and all other female over there in the one area all wore white did not clap nor stand
@shelshele1 @JRubinBlogger I have been following them from day one . The young Spanish lady is a time bomb and has bit off more then she can chew. The other India lady had the law changed where no one wears hats in house but her she can wear her head wrap and she wouldn't take our American oath,
@washingtonpost yes he did thats when all the ladies wearing white even Pelosi now called the kkk ladies they were proud of that except how does Schumer fit in Thats Pelosi Puppet . For See Pelosi is the Ring leader of the ladies of KKK in white
@WhiteHouse A hero
@TheBeatWithAri @MSNBC Pelosi Trying to be civil.
@JRubinBlogger again bashing the @POTUS  but yet never find the positive. what are you gonna do when he wins a nd term or another President wins you will go after them . Is it your job to beat people up be a bully. Your parents must be so proud of you. One day it will be turned around on you ,
@JRubinBlogger all that is happening is doom the other KKk whit lady is passing a law where she is the only one that can wear her wrap are you for real the other quoted kill the MF
@JRubinBlogger you really crack me up. Pelosi didnt care about anything until it came to the ladies in white which now everyone will be calling the woman of kkk .You got one who is a crazy ticking young girl that is a time bomb. one who would take a American oath/but would take her type . Doom
@NBCNews ok so does that mean they have eyes on him in his room to see what he is doing then ? Or does that mean you have cameras planted in his office to know every mov he makes? HMMM
Gotta Love Bernie Sanders face between his naps on this one https://t.co/pIZkb8vcO0
@Scavino45 @realDonaldTrump Loved it as Bernie Sanders dozes on and off during the whole thing. Which tells me he should just go home and stay there in his rocking chair and watch tv , There is no way he will make it to be President in 2020
@MeghanMcCain it doesn't haunt him by far , I am deeply for your loss as I know how you feel to lose a father. But I think it is all about politics ad yes your dad should be left alone to rest in peace. But if not trump it will be someone else . I am so sorry sweety I am truly sorry
@JRubinBlogger @NorahODonnell @jeffglor @VP or maybe you were always were that dumb . I bet you are all for the ladies who wore white  and sat together and didnt clap for anything until he mentioned woman this woman that. they should be call the woman of kkk stick together
@JRubinBlogger @NorahODonnell @jeffglor @VP Just as he said he means what he say and does what he says you all you all just dont like the fact he is doing it to protect us instead of spending it on other areas or the world where he is thinking about protecting us first..

@HorizonUnltd @seungminkim @VP First off who are you to call someone here as a adult ignorant or a lying.  . First off this country should come first and be protected from everything and everyone.  Immigrants trying to come over should go through the right process
@HorizonUnltd @seungminkim @VP Mexico has agreed to pay for some of the wall but now since the President wants steel Mexico is only going to pay for what they originally proposed to pay.
@CBSNews @CBSNewYork And Pelosi wants send 57 billion dollars over there for their needs . look at what they just did really
@MSNBC So why doesn't Pelosi take some of her large pay check that she receives and donate it along with some of the others like Schumer and all the other ones then everyone will have gotten payed. See @POTUS donates his pay check except a dollar which by law he has to take a dollar .

@kikuandjuju @seungminkim @VP With that again I am not in his mind to understand why so I don't judge.  It's not my place to judge .
@kikuandjuju @seungminkim @VP I think my opinion is he wants steel so it goes further down in the ground because there still could be tunnels dug but if the steel goes deep enough it will be to hard . But again that's my opinion

@MPMontague2 @realDonaldTrump The truth of it all is the whole world is not safe anymore even up in Canada  you have areas where Islamic people do things to children that are horrible.

amen to that . the truth comes out https://t.co/bYopjBdOPL
@kikuandjuju @seungminkim @VP puppets are Schumer and his side kick Speaker of the house Pelosi
@kikuandjuju @seungminkim @VP this is all facts that are found in 2006 in the @BostonGlobe globe
@kikuandjuju @seungminkim @VP Obama was talking about the Secure Fence Act of 2006, legislation authorizing a barrier along the southern border passed into law with the support of 26 Democratic senators including party leaders like Hillary Clinton, Joe Biden, and Chuck Schumer.
@kikuandjuju @seungminkim @VP Obama said on the Senate floor in October 2006. He praised the legislation, saying it would provide “better fences and better security along our borders” and would “help stem some of the tide of illegal immigration in this country.”
@kikuandjuju @seungminkim @VP In 2006, Democrats were saying ‘build that fence!’WASHINGTON — As a senator, Barack Obama once offered measured praise for the border control legislation that would become the basis for one of Donald Trump’s first acts as president. “The bill before us will certainly do some good
@kikuandjuju @seungminkim @VP will do
@mattalleng @shiftms I was dx 7years ago with ppms while I was a nurse. So when the Neuro asked about symptoms from years back like dropping things , headaches pain , foot drop,
@MKronert @seungminkim @VP uh what does any of that mean ?
Help by getting veterans to the Texas border https://t.co/Os8yC2sWms
@seungminkim You know everyone can be a hater on President Trumph or @VP Pence but the fact is they are doing what many others promised and never followed through . Obama , Clinton all wanted the wall and the 2 puppets Democrats wanted it to. But now you have someone backing his word that it
love this https://t.co/Svb6HgmDIO
@davidfrum wow that was a good one for the 2 dumb and dumber to chew on . Good info thanks
@realDonaldTrump @FoxNews We need to worry about our Country and our people not give millions of dollars to Syria that could give to craps excuse my language about us when we have so many issues here even with our Veterans who live on the streets who fought for our freedom that have nothing . crimes. poor
@realDonaldTrump I agree Sir President. To me those 2 are fake . They both agreed to have a wall when Clinton and Obama were in office. Now a man who is in office backing his words up they change their mind. Thats why you had a GoFundMe for over 20million you go sir, Stand strong we support you.
@shiftms @TheMSKittylady our puggle does that but with licking your neck and face https://t.co/f83DeWj3ko
@MSNBC part 3 of me tweet what about us people who are abused in nursing home. education lack of in schools. sex offenders spend less time in jail then someone who gets busted for drugs. But they can rape a 10 ear old girl like my child and have are a record and get a 1 year in county
@MSNBC also the veterans that are the street the illegals that are taking jobs from the Americans then they become poor , the drugs that come in from not  just where the wall is built but from other areas that kills more children, gangs, medical,foodets
@MSNBC I believe why dont they ask the people live outside in the normal world REP |Dem yes you will get neg responses but also good responses. IF people put up 20 million dollars on a go fund me for the wall that tell you something. We need to worry about our people first the homeless
RT @realDonaldTrump: Democrats are saying that DACA is not worth it and don’t want to include in talks. Many Hispanics will be coming over…

I stand by our @POTUS . Dumb and Dumber from the other night nigh seem to forget we have news cast of the saying they wanted the wall when Obama was in office and Clinton was to even when his wife ran it for him lol he was busy playing around. https://t.co/NDSXfZrqaG
@realDonaldTrump I totally agree with you. We have enough problems here now in our country that you are working with. That Democrats I call Dumb and Dumber . from the other night who agreed with Obama and Clinton that they wanted the wall and now you are doing it and they back down. Hipocrits.

@memphissmitty @BillKristol @POTUS well if I did make a couple of mistakes please forgive me . Due to my MS my brain and fingers do not work at the same time SIR
@BillKristol @POTUS also he has been staying by his word . the other 2 that came on last night after omg they are fake because we all have videos of them both when Obama and Clinton or should say when Hilary ran the office for her husband they were all. For the wall with them. Now oh now.. https://t.co/E9ynFBNlzE
@BillKristol I believe in @POTUS  because we have had many presidents that said they would do things and never followed through . . He is concerned for us first the veterans that sleep on the street that fought for our freedom . healthcare that I personally was denied 3 time from Obama care .
