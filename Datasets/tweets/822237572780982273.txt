@_thymes @atwater_x @Peaches_Sabrina @Thomas_Young77 @JeffreyGuterman @sarita_santos1 @SteveScalise @NRA I don't want to ban firearms.  I want an assault weapons ban, because I'm not a barbarian who thinks a weapon of war should be in the hands of civilians.
@Tom_wymer @_thymes @JeffreyGuterman @sarita_santos1 @SteveScalise @NRA This link proves Chicago tried to release their own data, but is blocked by federal law from doing so.

@Tom_wymer @_thymes @JeffreyGuterman @sarita_santos1 @SteveScalise @NRA Hand guns are used in murders.  The AR15 is used in mass shootings.  They are two separate things, with different psychology behind each.

@_thymes @sarita_santos1 @JeffreyGuterman @SteveScalise @NRA We do.  That's why we want a weapon based off the design of a combat weapon banned, immediately.  It worked.

@Exile_Libtards @timclayton010 @FoxNews @SecElaineChao Imagine seeing bad policy by Democrats, then seeing Republicans trying to pass the same policy &amp; not actually giving a shit that only Republicans try to sell off our federal infrastructure, not a couple hundred parking meters.
@rlittle600 @MartyMcfly119 @FoxNews @WhiteHouse @CNN Imagine seeing the most corrupt administration in history steal from us, which the founders warned was a threat to any republic, and thinking "but Obama" who had the most ethical administration in the last 40 years.

@timclayton010 @FoxNews @SecElaineChao Nice strawman, but your baseless assumption doesn't change the fact selling off our infrastructure, probably to China, is a threat to national security and it should stay nationalized, and we should pay to fix it, not be greedy, lazy slobs, willing to destroy the future

@rowan_hc @pdxlawgrrrl On the East coast we have a system of support that helps the homeless get in contact with government agencies and charities, which help them get more permanent shelter and helps with life skills, like looking for a job.  Do you guys have charities like that out there?
@rowan_hc @pdxlawgrrrl There's always problems with the shelters.  They are not perfect. Nothing humans do is ever perfect.    But they're a hell of a lot better than the alternative.
@rowan_hc @pdxlawgrrrl NIMBYs are the worst.  Zoning is really screwing up the west coast, you need good central planning to fix this issue.  		Maybe lobby the mayor to pass a right to shelter law for when it's below a certain temperature, which would force the city to build shelters?
@heykerrieannn @pdxlawgrrrl https://t.co/yyqSQT0tvF
@pdxlawgrrrl I'm confused as to what you guys do differently from the East Coast.  We have homeless here, but none sleep in the streets unless they choose to.  Not even in NYC. And when it gets below a certain temp, cops go round up the homeless &amp; put them in a shelter, so they don't freeze

It's just common sense
@gointomexico @CaptParker1775 @AllBungled @lyndaluATL @RealJamesWoods Your article is from an unreliable source.  I linked 538, which studies data
@gointomexico @lyndaluATL Most gun deaths are from hand guns.   It's not about a ban, it's about controlling sales, so everyone needs to get a background check, to stop gun running.  It's about local police properly reporting domestic abuse, which most mass shooters committee before they kill people
@FourthCastle @Shanti__Ananda @CaptParker1775 @AllBungled @lyndaluATL @RealJamesWoods Political.That's the problem.
