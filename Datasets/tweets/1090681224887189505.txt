Over  the last  5 years, we  are also Really  Proud of the over  150 Former TX Bluechips  Players that were participating  at the College Level ! 		We  look  forward  to the next  group of HS Players  we’re assembling for the  2019 Spring &amp; Summer !
We've had 5 Players Selected  in the NBA Lottery,  more than any other Program  in the Country in the last 10  years! We’ve also had 3 other Players  that have made NBA Teams as Free Agents  after not being Drafted! Other Bluechips Players have established Pro Careers Overseas
As  much  success  as we’ve  had with our  Players getting  College Scholarships,  we’ve had just as much  success preparing our Players  for the Pros ! Beginning in 1998,  we have had 7 former Players selected  in the 1st  Round  of the  NBA Draft !
The   Bluechips  have  had  the  privilege  of  assisting  over  1000  High  School  Prospects  involved  in  our  Program  to  play  College  Basketball  all  over  the  Country.
