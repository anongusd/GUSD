People feel like they have to shut up. That they can't say what they think because they'll be punished. This has a chilling effect on everyone's ability to speak and think freely. https://t.co/YOAtTAhMNc
Voters want their leaders to care about and protect them. The globalist left can never deliver, because they can’t acknowledge that the concerns of one country outweigh those of any other. As long as democracy is allowed, voters will reject this. You can’t bully them forever.
How'd we get to a place where it's normal that two parts of the country despise each other? That you can imagine the other side encouraging terror? Our thinking changed. We stopped debating politics &amp; ideas &amp; started attacking others for things we can't change, for who we are.
If anyone has mocked Native Americans, it's Warren. She stole their identity &amp; leveraged their suffering to climb the greasy pole of our fake meritocracy. Actual Indians are disgusted. The Cherokee Nation released a statement today calling Warren's claims "inappropriate &amp; wrong".

#ICYMI Part of a segment from tonight on big tech's political efforts #Tucker https://t.co/X8iNp1BsfN
6/6 What's at stake isn't a cable news segment. It's the existence of rational conversation in America. If they can prevent you from asking honest questions, there's nothing they can't do. More on this tomorrow night.
5/6 But our leaders aren't even asking these questions. Instead they're trying to silence anyone who raises them, while at the same time promoting mindless tribalism for political expedience. Division keeps them in power.
4/6 These are the questions our leaders out to be asking every day. How does a nation of 325 million people hang together? What do we all have in common as Americans? Why should we remain a country? Nothing is more important than answering this.
3/6 "Do you get along better with your neighbors and coworkers if you can't understand each other, or share no common values? And if diversity is our strength, why is it OK for the rest of us to surrender our freedom of speech to just a handful of tech monopolies?"
2/6 Here are the words from our segment: "How precisely is diversity our strength? Can you think of other institutions, such as marriage or military units, in which the less people have in common, the more cohesive they are?"
1/6 The organized left is lying about a segment we did on Friday night. Our topic was "diversity is our strength," a phrase our leaders use to end conversation rather than spur it. You hear it all the time. We asked, what exactly does it mean? Is it true?
The assistant deputy undersecretary of god knows what decided he’s king, you’re a moron &amp; we’re doing things his way. If you ask questions about it he calls you a racist &amp; cancels your Twitter. He never stops lecturing you about how vital democracy is &amp; how you’re a threat to it.

What's on TV is a political tactic but something else terrifying is going on. Formerly responsible ppl suddenly sound like extremists. Left's no longer working to convince those who disagree. They’re trying to destroy those in the way. It’s not a pose. They're sincere. It's war.
That’s why they’re always lecturing you about the patriarchy and the evil of the nuclear family. Millions and millions of American kids are growing up with one parent at home thanks to their policies. That’s fine with them.
You think any of these people care about family separation? If they did, they’d be upset about the collapse of the American family, which is measurable and real. They’re not. They welcome that collapse, because strong families are an impediment to their political power.

Mueller's investigation grinds on, as it has for an 1 yr. So far the whole thing has produced zero evidence that Trump colluded w/ the Russian govt. None. But Mueller’s many supporters in DC don’t seem to care. That because the investigation was never about Russia, obviously.
This week marks the 1 yr anniv of the Mueller probe. Costing millions &amp; our political system has been brought to a virtual standstill. The public is recognizing the investigation for what it is: A political witch hunt created by an elite cabal frantic to keep its hold on power.
The Mueller probe is no longer a law enforcement investigation. It's a hit job. This pleases the Left. Removing Trump is the only principle they recognize. Instead of admitting it, they lecture us about the rule of law, as if they actually care about the Constitution. They don't.
The biggest threat to America isn't Putin, but China. Consider: China spies on us more than any other country. It's behind the massive OPM hack carried out from '12-'14.  It has the largest population &amp; will soon have largest economy. Its military is growing rapidly in strength.
The cost of college rises each yr. Most students need hefty loans to attend. Yet classes teach less than ever, unless it's extremist political ideology. But even if college is failing, most kids feel they have no choice but to go. Next we'll give you some alternatives to college.
Let's review. Trump ran promising to improve relations w/ Russia...voters agreed. But permanent DC hated the idea. They’ve been pushing war w/ Iran for yrs. Closer ties w/ Russia would make an Iran war more complicated. Russia needed to be our enemy, no matter what voters wanted.

The new budget legislation will trigger a trillion-dollar deficit, or come very close to that...There's an awful lot of pork in it. You'd think it would fund the critical needs of our country. Does it? Not even close. It does pretty much the opposite of what was voted for in ’16.

“By the end of the year, you will have . . . learned how to apply marxist [sic], feminist, post-colonial [and] psychoanalytical . . .lenses to literature.” This is a public school. https://t.co/GeSNOK9brN!
Air BnB used the #SOTU address as an opportunity to denounce the @realDonaldTrump administration. Check out my interview with their head of policy. #Tucker https://t.co/PslazUpvxN
Dem members refused to stand or clap when Trump praised the nat'l anthem, military vets, low black unemployment...What's going on here? What if Dems actually don't like those things any more? What if praising our vets or our flag really does enrage the modern left? #Tucker

Dem Party has gone insane. Their new position is that it's immoral to restrict any kind of immigration, from any country, in any amount, for any reason. Even enforcing our existing laws, the ones they voted for &amp; passed in Congress, is tantamount to a hate crime. #Tucker
The point of our immigration policy, of all of our policies, is to help Americans. Watching out for our citizens is the reason we have a gov't in the first place. If ppl in other countries enjoy &amp; benefit from what we do, great. That's an added bonus and we welcome it. #Tucker

20. In the end all that really counts is relationships with other people. No matter how successful you are, if your kids hate you, you've failed.
19. Want to make the world better? Raise decent children, preferably a lot of them.
18. History happened, whether you like it or not.
17. Any food that makes your mouth water is likely bad for you.
16. Laws change. Customs and beliefs change. Human nature never changes.
15. Charity begins at home. Before you send a check to fight malaria in Congo, or sponsor a Syrian refugee to come to Minneapolis, ask yourself why so many of our fellow Americans are living on the street or dying of drug overdoses, and what you can do to help.
14. The US government has only one duty, securing the well-being of American citizens. Yet relatively few people who work for the government actually believe that.
13. No text message or social media post is ever worth interrupting a meal with people you love.
12. New and improved electronic devices rarely improve your life. Often they enslave you.
11. The only immutable law is the law of unintended consequences.
10. No matter how many public safety agencies government bureaucrats invent, when it comes down to it, you’re responsible for yourself and your family. Best to know that and prepare ahead of time.
9. Animals are closer to humans than we think, and people are closer to animals.
8. Gender is not a social construct. It's a biological reality. Men and women are inherently different, and not interchangeable. Pretending otherwise isn't just absurd and anti-science. It’s also a surefire way to make healthy relationships impossible and devastate society.
7. The beginning of wisdom is understanding how little you can control.
6. Attacking people because of their skin color is wrong. This is always true, no matter what the color is.
5. Friendship is more important than politics. So are sports, dinner, church, dogs, and most hobbies.
4. You have an absolute right to say what you think is true. Other people may not like your views. Tough luck.
3. Sending more texts and emails does not make you more productive.
2. Reading the internet all day does not make you smarter.
1. Wars almost never make countries richer or happier, and should be avoided accordingly.
2018 may be the current year, but we have twenty old, very uncurrent pieces of advice for getting through it:
.@CortesSteve: Chain migration has been a disaster for our country. We need to move to a merit based system. We want people that love our country and love our values to come here #Tucker @FoxNews
