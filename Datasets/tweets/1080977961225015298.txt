@disinfoagent007 @steph2monaco @RAMRANTS @LindseyGrahamSC @JoeBiden Have yet to see a video showing this. Feel free to provide HONEST proof (unedited, no photo shop, etc).
@eugenegu Trump is not intelligent or compassionate to understand problems that some woman and/or babies face. He is a evil man who prefers to inflict pain on women. He has also showed us that he thinks so little of children by rapping them, separating them from family, and suffering .
@Sky_Lee_1 He is probably just mixing up the story of his birth. His parents begged the Doctor but the Dr. refused. Unfortunately for America.
@RepCunningham Once again, I must commend you on the job you are doing. Keep up the good work.
@DerekCressman https://t.co/efMpmFCJBb
@67jewelCDH No, he thinks that he can't be touched and gets away with to much. He also has to much information that can do us harm once he leaves office. He needs to be punished with stipulations about his knowledge. If not, then he may sell his information and continue feeling untouchable.
@steph2monaco @RAMRANTS @LindseyGrahamSC @JoeBiden You want to see fondling of children. But so far the videos of Biden that I have seen are harmless. If that is what you call fondling children then parents,family members, teachers, doctors, not to mention the pictures of trump &amp; Ivanka + his comments, etc. Should be in prison.
@hhoover314 @RAMRANTS @LindseyGrahamSC @JoeBiden Yea proof would be nice, cause I'm not buying it.
@LindseyGrahamSC @JoeBiden @realDonaldTrump @VP Mr. Graham, you act like you will still be in office after 2020 election! You said you are close to trump because you are from a red state and that's your best bet to stay. The way I see it is trump is only close to criminals and lieing cheats. Doesn't make you look good.
@LindseyGrahamSC @realDonaldTrump 1.) You can watch/read MSM after a Dem is elected and you are home for going against our constitution and along with a fake emergency. 	2.) Trump doesn't have the ability to get it done or be advised when it comes to foreign relations.	3.) Why ask, are you loosing you usefulness?
@RepCunningham Great job Rep. Cunningham! This is a good step in the right direction!
@DanCrenshawTX @DonaldJTrumpJr This bill would have stopped the Charleston 9/Dillon Roof shooting. If other agencies would have done there job, it would have stopped the Parkland shooting. This bill is not the fix all but it is needed and a very good start in the right direction. Get the NRA out of politics.
@ETTalkShow @Jim_Jordan @RepMarkMeadows @InformantShow Our election was tampered with. I would like to get to the bottom of this so this can be prevented in the future. It doesn't matter who became president. The fact that Russia possibly influenced this is very disturbing. The fact the president may have been a party, even worse.
@ETTalkShow @Jim_Jordan @RepMarkMeadows @InformantShow The Democrats on the other hand did just that. They asked questions that would reveal/clear Trump of wrong doing. The attempt to manipulate Cohen's testimony tell's me that they are either afraid of Trump or just don't care about the fact that America was violated, a victim.
@ETTalkShow @Jim_Jordan @RepMarkMeadows @InformantShow I beg to differ, this is a hearing. You are there to ask questions about Cohen's knowledge/action's of Trump's wrong doing. Not to retry Cohen. If the GOP thinks Trump is innocent, they should have asked questions that would prove this. I'm left to think that's not possible.
@LouiseMensch @Jim_Jordan @RepAdamSchiff He planned that right when his time was running out. That way it could be left hanging that way, hoping that people would think that they did something wrong. We know it was to discuss what he was and was not able to address. The only wrong was Mr. Jordan's manipulation of facts.
@tiger_reviews @SenatorLeahy Thanks, I will see if I can find anything.
@okhobieman2002 @SenatorLeahy @SenateDems Yes they are, along with some of the older generations. The Republican party is not what they were and neither are the Democrats I guess. Lol
@ACline99 @SenatorLeahy @SenateDems Do you think it should be ignored and we take our chances? In my OPINION, if Congress can't agree on the Green New Deal, then they should work together to come up with something everyone can agree on. I understand your difficulties in coming to terms with it.
@tiger_reviews @SenatorLeahy Do you have anything from 1986 that he mentioned? Or anything to say who in Congress is standing in the way, because they need to be voted out(should have been already) so we can get people who actually work for our well being.

Is it just me or does this qualify as intimidating a witness? @mattgaetz, why are you concerned with @MichaelCohen212's marriage? Wouldn't it make more since to question @realDonaldTrump's unfaithfulness with numerous females,  being that he is unfortunately the president? https://t.co/GBnf55TAAS

@LindseyGrahamSC @VP Just like the wall is not going to stop people from coming to seek asylum. Asylum seekers have the right under current law. Also, it is not right to steal people's land for a TRUMPT up emergency. Help give them a reason to stay in they country. We help others, why not them.
@LindseyGrahamSC @VP Mr. Graham  tell the whole story. The solution to a HUMANITARIAN CRISIS is not a wall. A wall will not stop asylum seekers. Democrats, along with most Americans don't see the point in wasting money on a wall when what needs to be done is HUMANITARIAN AID like Venezuela gets aid.
@realDonaldTrump Lol, you are not fooling anyone that takes the time to educate themselves. You need to learn how to actually make a deal and get this done. Tariffs are paid by American's on imports. One day people will wake up and realize this, along with you tax scam for the rich.
Trump has no room to talk about abortion, or anything really. He has no morals and is just getting his base flared up to distract them . https://t.co/PPq0cSScrq
@AnitaNelson @itsYourGrace @LindseyGrahamSC @BenSasse OMG!!! I wanted to like this a hundred times. Trump doesn't care about kids, if he did he would not have kidnapped 1000's from there families and then say it's to much trouble to find them. I wonder if he sold them to one of his pervert friends. SICK !!!
@Galileo49 @shondi99 I am from South Carolina and I can tell you this, we don't like the new Lindsey Graham! We don't want him to be afraid of Trump. He comes across like he doesn't know what he is doing anymore, like he has lost his way. I have lost confidence in him.
@TheLearnedJDP @RepCunningham @GiffordsCourage @AMarch4OurLives @townhallproject If you look at mass shootings, those are examples of how strict laws could have saved lives. They either took a family members gun or purchased a gun when they should not have been able to.
@TheLearnedJDP @RepCunningham @GiffordsCourage @AMarch4OurLives @townhallproject Gun owners should be held more accountable for being irresponsible gun owners. If your gun is used in a crime and you haven't reported it stolen, you need to be accountable for failing to keep it out of criminal hands.
@TheLearnedJDP @RepCunningham @GiffordsCourage @AMarch4OurLives @townhallproject Just like many problems we face, the laws need to be enforced. We need strict laws and harsh penalties. Broaden background checks, and you can't get your gun till its complete. Close the loopholes  that allow people who shouldn't have guns to obtain them.
@TheLearnedJDP @RepCunningham @GiffordsCourage @AMarch4OurLives @townhallproject If you don't click on links then type it yourself in the search bar. As for keeping guns out of gangs hands, that falls on our justice system and law enforcement to do their jobs. Also they get guns through straw purchases, states with fewer gun laws, and stealing.

@smerconish @CNN Yes he deserves to be punished for his contribution to human trafficking. This should not be a misdemeanor. These women are kidnapped, then being forced to preform sex acts. It should be considered rape.
Trump doesn't want this story to be so real that his base starts to put 2 and 2 together and come up with trafficking trump or president pedophile. It needs to be out there for the world to see. https://t.co/L7fPi76Iib

@Lindanap123 @itsJeffTiedrich @realDonaldTrump @Lindanap123, you should really educate yourself with the FACTS. Don't listen to trump's,GOP'S, and MSM (fox) so much. There are government sites, and videos of hearings all out there for you to learn the truth. You just have to be willing to except trump is a disgrace to America
@Lindanap123 @itsJeffTiedrich @realDonaldTrump And finally trump under investigation- you know trump is not  special, every president is investigated it seems. It just happens Obama administration is the only one they have not found guilty in years and trump is the most corrupt administration. He even beat Nixon!
@Lindanap123 @itsJeffTiedrich @realDonaldTrump Spying on trump- not sure who you mean, but it's only admissible if done LEGALLY and you have to present reason for that. So, if he was not doing anything wrong, he has nothing to worry about and he got rid of some pretty corrupt people around him.
@Lindanap123 @itsJeffTiedrich @realDonaldTrump Lying under oath- there has been alot of that by trump's associates, other then that I am not sure who you are talking about.
@Lindanap123 @itsJeffTiedrich @realDonaldTrump Paying for fake dossier- Frankly I don't care who payed or why. I just want the truth, and overall the dossier have been corroborated. Some remains unverified but none of it has been disproven. Some may require access to classified information for verification. We will see.
@Lindanap123 @itsJeffTiedrich @realDonaldTrump Illegal storing emails- there was not enough evidence to charge her with a crime.FBI didn’t find vast quantities of exposed classified material, they also did not turn up evidence that Clinton intended to be disloyal to the United States or that she intended to obstruct justice.
@Lindanap123 @itsJeffTiedrich @realDonaldTrump Rigged primary- not sure but you might need to talk to the Russians/trump about that one. Maybe they didn't have enough dirt on Bernie for trump to beat him.
@Lindanap123 @itsJeffTiedrich @realDonaldTrump If the issue had gone to the tribunal for a decision, as was expected, the U.S. could have been on the hook for the full $10 billion in compensation Iran was seeking.
@Lindanap123 @itsJeffTiedrich @realDonaldTrump ...Although American hostages were  released a year later, issues (that $400 million) were not settled. The tribunal process dragged on for years. When arbitration process was  about to wind up (not in our favor), the U.S. agreed to $400 million with $1.3 billion in interest.
@Lindanap123 @itsJeffTiedrich @realDonaldTrump Cash Iran- Back in late 1979, after Iranian revolutionaries took 52 Americans hostages, the United States severed diplomatic relations with Iran and froze Iranian assets in America of $400 million fighter jets from the U.S. that Iran’s previous government had already paid for.
@Lindanap123 @itsJeffTiedrich @realDonaldTrump IRS Targeting- not sure what you mean except asking trump for his taxes just like so many presidents and VP before him. No targeting, just asking for transparency like always.
@Lindanap123 @itsJeffTiedrich @realDonaldTrump The Inspector General's report, recommended 14 federal officials for disciplinary action, ranging from ATF agents to federal prosecutors involved in the Fast and Furious operation. There is to much to list here, but it began during Bush's presidency and Obama was not found guilty
@Lindanap123 @itsJeffTiedrich @realDonaldTrump Fast n furious- President Barack Obama appeared on Univision and spoke about the "gunwalking" controversy. He said that neither he nor Attorney General Holder authorized Fast and Furious. Serious mistakes were made, we'll find out and we'll hold somebody accountable.
@Lindanap123 @itsJeffTiedrich @realDonaldTrump ...purpose of the plan was tax avoidance. In August 2015, the Inspector General of the U.S. Energy Department put most of the blame for the incident on Solyndra.
@Lindanap123 @itsJeffTiedrich @realDonaldTrump Solyndra- Newly revealed emails showed that the Obama administration had concerns about the legality of the Department of Energy's loan restructuring plan. U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware ruled "that the evidence does not support a finding that the principal..
@Lindanap123 @itsJeffTiedrich @realDonaldTrump Benghazi- Despite numerous allegations against Obama administration officials of scandal, cover-up and lying regarding the Benghazi attack and its aftermath, none of the ten investigations found any evidence to support those allegations.

Others still went around him to continue with other group. They are correct the elder did walk between the two groups, but be the judge of what was justified and what was not.  Once again, as stated many times, the tribe was there for peace and the Elder was singing for peace.
I was asked to RT this concerning the students mocking the VIETNAM VETERAN/Elder. It is long, but it shows the Elder walking between 2 sets of people, singing a song to calm the anger.

@AtlasAwakes I guess this is something I am still struggling with for the fact that me personally, I don't see the possibility of the situations you speak of. But I do understand the need of it was to happen. So, I would think long and hard about not voting for a ban. I can make any promises.
@AtlasAwakes The situation that you speak of, I have not seen that, but I can see your point that being armed with assault weapons would increase the chances of ones surviving and protecting what's theirs.
@AtlasAwakes This is because it is what is happening in this day and time.  I remember the LA riots and other situations like it. I am not sure that bringing assault weapons into the situation would have made it better.
@AtlasAwakes I actually read and reread what you wrote all day because it is something I wanted to give alot of thought to. I have realized that my reasons for banning is based on fear and compassion for lives that have been lost.
@AtlasAwakes It is not a way of thinking that I have adopted tho. I see the world changing and it scares me. Because of this I can see your side. You are the first person to actually discuss a reason behind it. Most are to busy arguing to have a conversation.
@AtlasAwakes Well I once again understand what you're say, but do you think that there is a chance that we will need to defend ourselves in this manner? My bestfriend and spouse are preppers and own assault weapons.  So I understand a little about there way of thinking.

@parscale I see you are raising money again. Don't you ever get tired of taking your supporters money? Probably not, and we all get a laugh out of the  intellectually challenged.
@AtlasAwakes You're correct, AR-15 didn't come back up. I want to thank you for taking the time to talk about this issue. You have given me alot to consider when speaking on this matter. I wish more people talked like adults on matters instead of being aggressive and argumentative.
@AtlasAwakes I am only speaking from my experience with my kids. I have always been very involved and aware of my children. I can tell as soon as they walk into the room how they are. I am sure not every parent can do this and not everyone is easy to read. Maybe a case by case issue.
@AtlasAwakes I feel like looking at the big picture it is a double edge sword when trying to keep guns in honest hands and out of criminal hands. Laws only work if they are enforced. I don't always see this to be the case.
@AtlasAwakes on a high speed chase, was caught with gun and drugs. You would think bond would be revoked, but he was arrested and out again the same day. I feel like the justice system is failing when it comes to gun crimes.  Like the whole slap on the wrist, and plea deal I talked about.
@AtlasAwakes I agree you have to know there is a problem to do anything, but there are times that a problem is known and nothing/very little is done. Example: A gentleman was arrested for murder a year ago, given a low bond and conditions of release was a ankle monitor. Same guy lead officers
@AtlasAwakes Gun owners held more accountable, I believe that if you know someone around you is suffering from a mental illness or doesn't need to have access to a gun for some reason. There should be extra measures taken to insure your gun doesn't get in there hands. Owners held accountable.
@AtlasAwakes As for fixNICS, its every 6 months they report and the consequence is your bonus is taken away and your name is put on a list. The reporting time needs improvement if I'm understanding it correctly. The reporting of mental health issues needs to be addressed and added, somehow.
@AtlasAwakes There are laws to charge people for buying guns for others, the problem with this (and other crimes) is people plea to a lesser charge or just get off with little or no punishment. There needs to be hard consequences and no plea bargain for certain crimes.
@AtlasAwakes I understand that we should trust our teachers, but currently we don't. Not everyone has the ability to homeschool or send there kids to private schools. This is something we are fight our school board on along with anti-bullying. I am for armed security.
@realDonaldTrump You say America first, but hurt America. You say you're not in bed with Russia, but make your choices based on benefiting Russia. We see you and your lies will not conceal the truth.
RT @CNN: The Trump administration does not know how many children were separated from a parent or guardian last year, but it's "thousands"…
@AtlasAwakes I also follow someone who is a parent of a victim of a mass shooting and they are fighting for gun control. It shows you how two people effected by the same thing can walk away with different views.
@AtlasAwakes I am a gun owner and believe in the right to bare arms. I personally don't feel the need for a assault rifle. I also believe in responsible gun ownership. I know something needs to change and I guess alot of people are desperate like me, for change. Compromise is not easy today.
@AtlasAwakes And last, people buying guns for criminals. I guess that goes hand in hand with the owner being responsible for there guns in a way. If the gun they bought is used in a crime, they are held accountable unless its reported stolen.
@AtlasAwakes I feel like gun owners need to be held responsible for the guns they own and keeping them out of the hands of some people. I feel like some of these mass shootings could have possibly been prevented.  We may never know.
@AtlasAwakes As for background checks, I believe they need to include some forms of mental illness. Mental illness is also something I feel needs to be addressed. I'm not sure how background checks would work with HIPA laws though.
@AtlasAwakes Currently in my area (it happens in other areas too) we are having a problem with a teacher who believes that one race needs to intimidate another. This teacher was moved from one elementary school to another. There is alot of racial tension. Also sexual abuse ALOT.
@AtlasAwakes I don't agree with assault rifles being in the hands of some people and for some any gun . I understand your point in protecting yourself with them. I have a hard time getting past the mass shootings. As for teachers carrying guns, I am against.
@AtlasAwakes Thank you for taking the time to type all this. I understand where you are coming from. Where do you stand on teacher's carrying? Background checks? Gun owners being held accountable for there guns? People buying guns for criminals?

The rate of our elected officials pay reflects the need for housing in 2 places. I do not agree with them living in there offices to save them money. It is still costly to tax payers and not fair. https://t.co/3yUwOnyoSi
@politico Doesn't @senatemajldr have a obligation to do his job and bring bills to the floor, and exercise the right to override a veto if need be? The Senate is comprised of 100, not 1. We rely on a system of voting by or elected officials. If McConnell won't do his job, he needs to leave

@DogginTrump The Obama admin's ban on discriminating on the basis of sex was related to biological sex or to gender identity. BUT the Trump admin. rescinded that front, meaning the federal government considers Title IX to only bar discrimination based on a student’s biological sex

@SenMcSallyAZ We the people want our government open and running.  That is what you are payed to do. You need to stand up to trump and the fact that he is hurting the AMERICAN people that elected him and you. 2020 can't come fast enough.
@SenMcSallyAZ Good try but that's not going to help all the people with out pay, a job, loans, services, farmers, etc. Do your job and open the government. We the people are not worried about you having your pay held back. We the people are worried about back pay for government workers.
@rounderstudio @SenMcSallyAZ If he vetos it, it goes back to House and Senate, they could then override the veto.  They just have to actually do there job.
@jakieemma @LindseyGrahamSC He has been corrupt for years is my understanding.  Gives the Republicans a bad name, they need to do something about it before he costs them there jobs.

@davidmweissman ..its bad for natural animal migration. It will be caught up in court for years. Farmers depend on workers in Mexico to farm because Americans don't want to. Money can be used for better things,and Trump needs to learn tantrums don't get u what u want or he will not stop.
@davidmweissman It's a waste of money. 	It won't work because of gaps.	Ms-13 started in Los Angeles not Mexico. 	The drugs, guns and trafficking come in by private planes of rich people like trump or	Corrupt boarder patrol. Or	Smuggled between other cargo coming in by planes, trains,  and cars.
