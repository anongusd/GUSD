Claude Worthington Benedum Foundation's Kim Tieman is kicking off our healthcare professionals conference at @CHHnews http://t.co/DdAgLRL5Lb
This morning Dr. Keith Fargo is sitting down with @wvgazettemail's @lydianuzum to talk Alzheimer's and ongoing research. #ENDALZ
Saturday, August 22, is the arts and crafts show at the Wood County Senior Center. http://t.co/Xmb33t20xR
Question from audience: Is keeping your brain active important?	Dr. Fargo: Yes! Social, cognitive, and physical activity are important.
Exercise or regular physical activity might play a role in both protecting your brain from Alzheimer's &amp; also living better with the disease
#AAIC2015 had 3 interesting studies looking at exercise as a treatment for dementia.
Low physical activity and high TV viewing may be associated with cognitive decline. #alzresearch #ENDALZ
Three new studies suggest there may be biological reasons for why women have a higher risk of Alzheimer's than men.
#AAIC2015 also looked at women and their risk of cognitive decline or dementia. #alzresearch #ENDALZ
#AAIC2015 introduced the first study of American Indian dementia incidence.
37% of Baby Boomers will have had Alzheimer's before they die. #alzresearch #ENDALZ
More than 28 million Baby Boomers will develop Alzheimer's between 2015 and 2050. #ENDALZ #alzresearch
What did we learn at #AAIC2015? There is HOPE on the horizon. #alzresearch #ENDALZ
What did we learn at #AAIC2015? The Alzheimer's epidemic is upon us. #alzresearch #ENDALZ
Alzheimer's is a worldwide problem. About 5.3 million living with Alz in the U.S. and 44 million worldwide. #alzresearch #ENDALZ
Currently, no therapies or treatments can cure Alzheimer's disease. #alzresearch #ENDALZ
Plaques are found outside brain cells and involve amyloid. Tangles are found inside brain cells and are made of tau. #alzresearch #ENDALZ
Plaques, tangles and loss of brain cells are the three hallmarks of Alzheimer's. #alzresearch #ENDALZ
Alzheimer's disease is not the only cause of dementia but it is the most common cause. #alzresearch #ENDALZ
What is Alzheimer's? A universally fatal brain disease with gradual onset. It is progressive and gets worse over time. #alzresearch #endalz
Dr. Keith Fargo is in Charleston tonight discussing Alzheimer's and dementia research. #endalz #crw #cwv http://t.co/txre3nqnPX
