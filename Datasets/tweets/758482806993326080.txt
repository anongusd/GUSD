Undocumented immigrants are not legally eligible for welfare. The numbers who cheat to get it are small as it would endanger their immigration case.

@gomezdr @bmudssa @DanCrenshawTX But, in general, yes, we do need to do better for our veterans all around.	Absolutely no argument from me on that issue. A lot of my cousins are in the military and two of my brothers are USMC.

@AngryBlackLady So, basically, this version of history, atrocities are whitewashed to try to absolve white people of guilt.		I think that pretty much sums it up.
@AngryBlackLady This system lasted until around 1661 - 1676 when the colonies went to full slavery.		So, while some historical accounts refer to those earliest Africans as "indentured servants", to do so is disingenuous at best. Less than half ever gained any freedom.		https://t.co/1LRpCwInUl
@AngryBlackLady I think he's referring to the Headright System in the early 1600's.	But his premise is still faulty as many "indentured servants", including some Africans, under that system never lived to claim their freedom &amp; often had years tacked on to their "contracts" to keep them enslaved.

@jgrxrepublican @juiceDiem @AOC @snopes But you didn't start your adult life with an 800+ credit score either, I'm willing to bet. You had to work for several years to build a decent score.	And that is the disparity between the rich and the poor / middle class.

@jgrxrepublican @juiceDiem @AOC @snopes My friend's son, a $25 million trust fund baby at birth, has had a credit score of 800+ since age 6. The trust fund managers did this and it is not uncommon among the wealthy elite.	Poor and even middle class children do not get this advantage starting out.
@ilenes57 @juiceDiem @AOC @snopes I had something like 20 of these. I'm now down to the last 2 and my credit has gone from the 480s to the high 590s and 600+ on one.	Also get 2-3 credit cards, secured, unsecured, does not matter. Charge a sandwich or something and then pay it off just before the due date.
@ilenes57 @juiceDiem @AOC @snopes I had this problem.	Call them up and make a payment arrangement with them. Even if just $5/mo. So long as you make the payments, it will help your score.	Negotiate to have interest and fees removed and to have the entries reflect they are being paid on as agreed.
@jgrxrepublican @juiceDiem @AOC @snopes However, credit age is a determining factor in your credit score. So without a long term line of credit, such as a credit card, you never meet the credit age requirement and stay stuck in the mid 600s max, regardless of your fiscal responsibility.
@Audrey_2727 @juiceDiem @AOC @snopes If you are poor, you're the one most likely to NEED to borrow money to get through an emergency or temporary crisis.
@kryssramoss @katmrowr @juiceDiem @AOC @snopes I spent 14 years after my divorce paying off an insane amount of debt my ex left me with. It made not one bit of difference to my credit score. Its maddening. The ONLY thing that has made a difference is getting two credit cards and using them judiciously.
@bernardigiri @juiceDiem @AOC @snopes I made a comment elsewhere on this thread about how the system pretty much FORCES you to get credit cards in order to satisfy the credit age requirement, otherwise this is exactly what happens. You pay off something and your credit tanks because your credit age drops.
@cordellabney @juiceDiem @AOC @snopes I was in the 480s last April.	I managed to break into the 600s recently on one of the credit companys' scores. I'm getting there...	It's just a slow process.
@whoisyermomma @JLSelby @juiceDiem @AOC @snopes The trade off is that credit age is a determining factor in your credit score. So if you want good credit, you are pretty much FORCED to get credit cards to have any long term credit accounts to satisfy that particular requirement.
@WhoCare_75 @IanTitley4 @juiceDiem @AOC @snopes My stepmom's family is in the insurance business.		Yes, it is true. Your insurance rates are higher on lower credit scores. This comes from the insurance companies themselves, not your local agents.
@IanTitley4 @juiceDiem @AOC @snopes I know, right?	It's insane. I drove OTR as a truck driver for 10 years. Had over a million accident and ticket free miles but no use for a car.	When I went local and got a car, my insurance was insane..because of my credit - despite my driving record.

@blytheiam @brandonformby The guy she is buying the RV from has given us until the 20th to pay off the balance of $1900 to get it back.		I know what you mean. A lot of people are feeling the pain with this shutdown unfortunately.

@blytheiam @brandonformby That's where I'm at. I'm good now, so I try to help others.	She's still in the hospital currently. They wanted to *arrest* her for trying to kill herself. Total Neanderthals around here. I had to use some political pull to put a stop to that.

@senatemajldr You do not live here.	I do.		A continuous wall/fence is not only impractical along our border, it is disastrous for native wildlife, state revenue, ranchers and the environment of the Rio Grande Valley.
@senatemajldr It would destroy a butterfly sanctuary which is vital habitat for multiple butterfly species. 	It would destroy a historic 120 year old church.	It would cut off access to the Rio Grande for recreation - a significant source of revenue for south Texas.
@senatemajldr A fence would block larger native species from the water source they are dependent upon, interfere with their natural migration routes and food resources.	It would increase flooding along the border and cut off an escape route from flooding for native species.
@senatemajldr They are for it in limited areas. Not as a coast to gulf continuous fence.	A full border fence would be an environmental and ecological disaster. Also, given the natural barrier the terrain presents in areas makes a wall unnecessary.

RT @JillWineBanks: Here's another wonderful cartoon from another Twitter friend. https://t.co/Pe6HElUJrk
This was two days before the Tree of Life Synagogue shooting. She had developed a sudden urge to watch the Holocaust survivor testimonies. 	She told me something bad was about to happen but she didn't know exactly when or where. https://t.co/4CwdDc3FSu
On another note, you should talk to her sometime. She has some gifts of her own.	Look at the dates. https://t.co/PNgoJwX8QY
So, I don't know what, if anything you can do, but I'm at a point of utter desperation and frustration. She's going to lose the $7100 she's already paid if I can't get her some help. She may lose her vehicle at the end of the month if they won't defer another payment.
I have no idea why it has been an uphill battle to get anyone to help her.	But if you've read this far, then you know she's tried to kill herself, twice, over this. I've never seen her so defeated and it rips my heart out.
If it matters, this woman has the kindest heart. She has always helped others out.	She took in another domestic abuse survivor and her teenaged daughter who had nothing and supported them until they could get their feet under them.	Never asked anything in return.
This is a rural county without many resources. There is nothing to help her get her "home" back because:	A) Its an RV, which they won't help with.	B) She has to pay off the balance to get it back.
She tried a GoFundMe campaign and not a single person responded. Not one.	I've started another one for her since she deleted the one she started. Again, not a single response.		https://t.co/9MM0d1rQCs
So, where we are now is that her RV, which was her primary and only residence, has been repossessed.	I've managed to get the guy she was buying it from to give us until January 20th to come up with the $1900 balance she has left owing on it.
And there is absolutely no way to fix this mess until the government reopens.	This is her story in her own words...		https://t.co/3qrAS5fbHo
https://t.co/7BTZHHAokr
I got involved in December and on December 13th, I got the IRS to reduce the garnishment to $189/mo.	They failed to send out the notice to her disability insurance company before the government shut down.	She's been left with $145/week to live on. https://t.co/XeHDgQoQbh
To compound the IRS problem, they started deducting the IRS levy in November. They weren't supposed to start until December in order to give her time to file the missing returns. She didn't know that. She was trying to find a tax service to help her sort the mess out.
This is the same ex-husband who tried to kill her and almost succeeded. For example, here is the MRI of her back. She still has damaged vertebrae. https://t.co/1ulVjnvSOD
After having surgery in October, she has been off on short term disability.	In early November, she received a letter from the IRS,  notice of wage levy. It turns out her ex-husband never paid taxes on the business he owned during the marriage.
@Zak_Bagans 	OK, I wasn't going to do this, but we have been SCREAMING for help for this woman. She's a big fan of yours so...yeah, I'm desperate now.	The current state of the government has left her destroyed and despondent. She's still in ICU.		Here is how we got here...

@LunaLuvgood2017 The most immediate need is rescuing her RV which is her only residence. It was an affordable living arrangement in a very expensive county.	She has to come up with $1900 by 1/20 or she loses it and the $7100 she's paid on it already.
@LunaLuvgood2017 If anyone can help, THIS woman desperately needs it. She's been wiped out.	The IRS has been garnishing her wages since the beginning of November. It was supposed to be reduced but they never sent it out before the shutdown.		https://t.co/9MM0d1rQCs

I will be filing a formal complaint later today. Do not be fooled by the brief explanations above.	Each violation will be fully detailed and supported with documentation.
If you KNOW of anyone experiencing these violations, you can also file a complaint. You do not have to know them personally.

Article 25(1)		By furloughing workers, cutting off access to vital government services, endangering the ability of citizens to meet basic human needs of shelter, food, and medical care. https://t.co/zG86wdpKBx

I charge that @realDonaldTrump is in violation of the UN Universal Declaration of Human Rights as follows:
@WhiteHouse @SecNielsen @UNHumanRights Article 16 (3)	Article 25 (1)
@WhiteHouse @SecNielsen @UNHumanRights Specifically, Article 23 - 1, 2 and 3
@WhiteHouse @SecNielsen @UNHumanRights Including and especially the poor, disabled and vulnerable.		As an American citizen, I formally request that you investigate.
@WhiteHouse @SecNielsen @UNHumanRights 	Our US president is committing human rights violations. 	- Work without pay	- Depriving US citizens of the ability to secure basic human needs of food, shelter and medicine.	- Depraved indifference	- Financial warfare against innocent American citizens
@coolmo183 @WhiteHouse @SecNielsen You beat me to it. This is my favorite go-to gif for the USDA Grade A bullshit that flows endlessly from the White House.
@ellievan65 And for those getting all happy and righteous about this...		It's going to affect you at the grocery stores later this year. So don't cheer yet. Less farming/ranching production results in higher grocery prices down the road.
@ellievan65 I have ranchers hauling cattle to the sales just to feed the remaining heads and get the money for their spring operations.		They are cursing Trump's name and, last Monday, attendance at our county Democratic Party meeting went from 20-35 to over 800...in a red red county.

@SteveScalise I have ranchers hauling cattle to the sale barn just so they can fund their spring operations...and they are cursing Trump's name.	He's cut their throats on one side with his tariff war and, now, is finishing them off by keeping them from being able to get USDA loans.
@SteveScalise So, not important enough to fight for for 2 years or pass the funding for and NOW it's a hair-on-fire national crisis worth waging a financial civil war against innocent American citizens for? What the ACTUAL hell is wrong with you, Steve?
@SteveScalise You guys had two years of total control.	You had reconciliation...but, obviously, your wall wasn't important enough to pass the funding for that way.	You had total control when YOUR House refused to pass a CR that passed unanimously in the Senate, to keep the government open.

@PeaceHelpLove @rahaf84427714 So I presume she's letting the friend handle her Twitter just in case she suddenly disappears.
@PeaceHelpLove @rahaf84427714 Can't have two people signed into the same Twitter account at the same time. If she's still concerned that she may be abducted, she wouldn't have time to sign out of the account so a friend could sign in or let the friend know to sign in.

@realDonaldTrump And crime in our country won't go "way down":		- As a group, immigrants, both documented and undocumented, commit fewer crimes per capita than native born citizens.		- 90% of illegal drugs coming into the US come in via shipping ports, ports of entry and the mail.
