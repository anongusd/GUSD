There would be some exemptions to automatic cuts including social security and Medicaid.  Clearly a sweetener for Dems.
If committee fails to pass $1.2 trillion in savings, it would trigger automatic savings cuts across the board.

POTUS would get 2nd debt limit hike of up $1.5 trillion if Congress either sends a BBA to the states or cmmte finds higher savings and cuts.
