@HabeebMakhoul94 @RepJayapal Sounds good on paper, but whenever costs are involved, you can expect govt to intervene and outlaw certain treatments due to expense. Insurance companies cannot deny covered treatments without showing medical license. Ask them for one, your treatment will be magically approved.

@doctornontrad @sonnyalbericci @redjebn @RepJayapal Most plans already cover this.
@doctornontrad @sonnyalbericci @redjebn @RepJayapal I fired my doctor years ago. 😂 Insurance is expensive because people run to the doctor whenever they get a sniffle. People will continue to get sick as long as they continue to eat garbage.
@doctornontrad @sonnyalbericci @redjebn @RepJayapal Natural healing methods are superior to pharmaceuticals. And cheaper.
@doctornontrad @sonnyalbericci @redjebn @RepJayapal This is one of those ideas that sounds great on paper, but this is not how it will actually play out. I've been around long enough to see how Washington operates. 🤣
@doctornontrad @sonnyalbericci @redjebn @RepJayapal All disease is caused by improper nutrition or environmental toxins.Therefore, disease is preventable. I would bet that more people are injured by medical malpractice than file for medical bankruptcy.
@doctornontrad @sonnyalbericci @redjebn @RepJayapal There is a better way to do this. They should detach insurance plans from the employer and let people shop around. More competition drives down costs. The only way to cut costs in single payer is limit treatment, or pay doctors less. No competition means you get what they pay for
@doctornontrad @sonnyalbericci @redjebn @RepJayapal I'm not at risk for medical bankruptcy. I'm very proactive about my health. When I see a doctor actually cure something, maybe I'll change my mind. Until then, I will continue to avoid doctors. Insurance for me is merely a safety net against accidents.

@PutYourPawzUp @iskandrah @thehill A christian school is not going to endorse this lifestyle. The Bible teaches against it. In fact, nobody had any outrage about their beliefs until she started working there.
@PutYourPawzUp @iskandrah @thehill But you think Lady Gaga is in a position to judge Pence? 😂😂😂 Now, you see the hypocrisy. Thanks for making my point.

@RepJayapal I thought Obamacare was supposed to fix this. You mean it it didn't work?
@SenFeinstein All this does is redistribute wealth and create more minimum wage jobs. What about the guy already making $15 per hour? You think he will get a raise to $20 per hour? Think again. Meanwhile businesses cut hours and raise costs of products. We all lose.
@Tarver8595 @RepBarbaraLee That's how I feel about sanctuary cities. Now you are getting it.
@Tarver8595 @RepBarbaraLee People who are here illegally are already breaking the law. Not sure why so many people fail to understand that. It's ironic that you would now question legality.

@RealCandaceO @directorblue This is today's liberal talking point. All the dems are tweeting it. These migrants were offered asylum in Mexico. Why would they continue to risk the lives of their children by pressing on? "Free stuff." They are not looking for asylum.
@PattyMurray Why didn't they stay in Mexico when they were offered asylum there? There would be no need for tear gas if there were no acts of violence. They continue to risk the lives of their families by pressing on. Proof that asylum is not what they are really seeking.
@DanRather I'm a skeptic because I have seen that numbers have been "tweeked." I would love to see a debate on this.
@OversightDems @RepCummings Why didn't they stay in Mexico when they were offered asylum there? Why do they endanger the lives of their families by continuing? 🤔 They do not want asylum.

If you don't do everything your doctor recommends, Medicare will deny treatment. What if you don't agree with your doctor or think treatment is unnecessary?
@SotekPrime @jfalbanese @Ocasio2018 I rarely use it, honestly. I have a lot of problems with the way insurance is being done. I think medicine should all be non-profit, and it should cover all available treatments, including natural healing methods.
@SotekPrime @jfalbanese @Ocasio2018 This is what we need to fix. I think it would be a great start to let people shop for their own policies, and not be at the mercy of their employer to provide it.

@BHQRUP @thehill That would save me a lot of money if they covered natural methods.
@BHQRUP @thehill I think insurance should be detached from people's employers. Let people shop around without worring about expensive government mandates. Let them choose conventional or natural methods of treatment.
@BHQRUP @thehill Check this out... https://t.co/BdbXPMumhB
@BHQRUP @thehill Health care is not the proper role of government. I am a big fan of people taking control of their own health and using natural methods of healing. This yields better results at a fraction of the costs.
@ABC People have gone out of their minds.
@thehill Irresponsible. No one should be endorsing violence.
@BHQRUP @thehill Not so much anymore. Therein lies the issue. My values have not changed. I use the constitution as the measuring stick for policy. I'm afraid it's been eviscerated by both parties.
@BHQRUP @thehill Sometimes, it seems they are trying to invoke an emotional response from people, which my brain does not compute. It prefers facts and statistics. It would appeal to me more if they tried to pursuade me with policy.

@emilyslist Democrats want you to vote for candidates based solely on gender, yet they want you to believe they support equality. Don't vote for this parade of idiots. https://t.co/BExYLYfl4V
@BHQRUP @thehill Here is a good example. We have a demoratic senator who claims to be for equality. She wants us to vote for candidates based solely on gender, not qualifications, ability, or policy. This doesn't sound like equality to me. It sounds sexist. https://t.co/e5OwkyGw7i
@radi0sil3nc3 We definitely need improvement. I am not denying that. Once you give up some of your freedoms, you never get them back. I would like to see the evidence first. There have been a lot of false predictions in the past, and this will give govt more control than they should have.
@BHQRUP @thehill Their policies always seem to take away more of my freedoms, and more of my money. There are few issues where I even agree with them anymore. People's views are very polarized.
@BHQRUP @thehill Honestly, I wouldn't even know where to start. I was more of a centrist, but the policies of the left kept shifting more toward collectivism and less toward individual freedoms.

Because most established employees will not get a raise when minimum wage goes up, and businesses will raise the prices of their goods and services, it can be concluded that raising the minimum wage is merely a form of wealth redistribution.

@SenGillibrand I have seen so many links to this petition, yet no one can confirm that they even read ANY of the 47,000 documents that were released. Have you read any of them or not?
@SenFeinstein Maybe you should ask his former clerks. They seemed to have very high opinions of him. All of them were women.

@PattyMurray Have you read ANY of the 47,000 documents that have already been released? https://t.co/CNwxc5G3xW
@SenKamalaHarris He should answer, but you should also read all of the documents you requested. 47,000 pages, and no one can verify that they read any of them.
@SenFeinstein Birth control is free at the Health Department. Stop trying to act like no one has access.
@KamalaHarris Abortion kills both males and females.
@RepJayapal @realDonaldTrump That sounds horribly ungrateful. I hope you are not counting on my vote. I am seeing so much disrespect. I actually have tangible results from these "so-called" horrible policies. More money and less taxes. Corruption exists on both sides. Clean your own house first.
@RoyBlunt Has anyone even read any of the documents yet?
It seems no one has even read ANY of the Kavanaugh documents. Please correct me if I'm wrong. No one is able to confirm that they've read any of them.
@SenWarren @fred_guttenberg @NRA I would like to know if you read any of the documents.

@SenFeinstein I hope you are not delusional enough to believe this. The American people disagree with you on the 2nd Amendment. Nothing was done about the compound in New Mexico. I would think that should be a priority for you.
@SenTedCruz I think it's a stall tactic before midterms. They're looking for any dirt they can find to keep him out &amp; they will scrutinize 42,000 pages of documents until they find something. They passed Obamacare without even reading it. We had to "pass it so we can see what's in it."
@SenatorDurbin I think he was right. Most Americans were against Obamacare. It's a shame that our representatives don't listen to us anymore. Both sides are guilty.
@SenKamalaHarris Hey pot, the kettle is calling. The irony is unbelievable.
@RealJamesWoods He should not have to go on TV and defend himself... for WORKING.
@RepJeffries It's been over 60 days. You should have met with him personally when you had the opportunity. Democrats should be embarrassed by this Dog &amp; Pony show.
@PattyMurray Health care is not the proper role of government. I want government OUT of my health care.
@SenKamalaHarris You should ask him about it. The problem is, some people are being treated "more equally" than others in the name of social justice. This happens at the expense of the rest of us. Hiring someone based on gender or skin color instead of ability, for example.
@ChrisCoons Finally! Someone who wants to do something productive. Thank you!
@RealJamesWoods This should keep everybody awake at night. https://t.co/i7pkuxl8my
@SenGillibrand Yes, abortion is putting lives on the line.
@RepEliotEngel Show me in the Constitution where abortion is protected. It must be missing from my copy.
@ABCPolitics No one would ever have to worry about this if no one legislated from behind the bench. This is what they've created.
@RepDonaldPayne Here's a crucial question: why didn't any Democrats meet with him personally when they had the opportunity? It's been over 60 days.
@cincity631 @PattyMurray I do agree that they should release the documents.
@cincity631 @PattyMurray The deadline needs to be BEFORE midterms, otherwise we all know what their agenda really is. All of them had an oppotunity to meet with him personally. None did. That speaks volumes. It's been over 60 days. They don't want him in &amp; will look for anything to prevent it. #WitchHunt
@RepBarbaraLee How can you conceal public records? Think about what you are saying here. And, why did none of you meet with him in person when you were all given the opportunity?
@SenSanders We shouldn't be subsidizing companies. Sink or swim.
@cincity631 @PattyMurray It's been over 60 days. This has turned into a Dog &amp; Pony show. Procedure should be followed. Documents should be released. My point is, they were already against him. No amount of documents will change that. Their goal is to stall until the election.
@SenateDems @SenFeinstein Please show me where in the Constitution health care is a right. It seems to be missing from my copy.
@RepJeffries You are lying to the voters. https://t.co/VQ3bceTesv https://t.co/Xqgc9lUXUd
@AnnCoulter Then, they would have to shut down their "Dog &amp; Pony" show.
@timkaine Jamming it through? It's been more than 60 days. You were against him before viewing any documents. You expect us to believe a million more are going to change that?
@SenatorHassan Most of you were against him before viewing any documents. I saw the petitions. I saw the tweets. You are all lying to the voters and using this as a stall tactic before midterms. Past tweets tell it all.
@ToddRokita Exactly. Most of them were against him before reviewing any documents. Petitions were circulating. Their past tweets say it all.
@SenFeinstein Too bad you did not have this kind of diligence with Obamacare. We would have known "if you like your doctor, you can keep him" was a lie. Instead, we had to "pass it so we can see what's in it." #FakeOutrage #StallTactic
@SenJeffMerkley Most of you were already against him before reviewing any documents. I don't think releasing a million more documents will change that, so I must conclude that this is merely a stall tactic before midterms. Past tweets tell the tale.
@KamalaHarris These "extreme positions" seem to be backed up by our Constitution and Bill of Rights. Voters, don't be fooled. Read our founding documents for yourselves and see. They clearly want a nominee who will legislate from behind the bench.
@PattyMurray Health care is not protected by the constitution. I don't see it anywhere in my copy. It's not even the proper role of government. I am much more interested in a nominee who will not legislate from behind the bench.
@ABC Sounds Constitutional. LIFE, liberty and the pursuit of happiness... And the 2nd Amendment. I don't see anything about health care rights in my copy of the Constitution, despite several senators trying to tell me it's in there.

@SenGillibrand By the way... it has nothing to do with gender. Not sure why you directed this to ladies. When you put people in a box and slap on a label, (women, blacks, gays, etc.) it fuels racism and sexism, thus you are part of the problem.
@SenGillibrand To be fair.... plenty of democrats are telling constituents that Trump does nothing but play golf... even though there are more jobs, lower taxes, more revenue coming in due to everyone working. Not only that, but a lot of what you are doing is counterproductive for conservatives

@SenWarren @realDonaldTrump Right wing extremists? You might want to look at the statistics. More people in America are pro-life than pro-choice. @SenWarren Not sure why you think it's not okay to separate families at the border, yet it's okay to rip a child from its mother during an abortion.
@SenGillibrand Let's just let everyone over the border. Even sex traffickers. Yeah, that will solve the problem. Illegals ARE a national security threat.
@marcorubio This is unprofessional and unacceptable. This is why I don't have cable, and don't watch TV. People are not civil to each other anymore. They are turning into animals and barbarians.

@RepSwalwell @FoxNews People have their heads way up in the TV. There is so much fake news on every mainstream channel, both liberal and conservative. I stopped watching years ago. They need to start revealing their sources, along with facts and statistics. No one cares about their opinions.
@NancyPelosi I agree! No one should rip a child away from its mother during abortion, either! Tell me why that's okay. @NancyPelosi Abortion is the worst form of child abuse. At least be consistent in your beliefs, otherwise no one will take you seriously.
@SenatorShaheen Please tell me why it is okay to rip a child away from its mother during an abortion. Where is the moral outrage? @SenatorShaheen Your beliefs are not consistent if you support abortion. This is why no one takes you seriously. Why should Trump listen to you?
@JacksonLeeTX18 @RepMaxineWaters She does not have the right to incite violence. We The People, as her employer, have the right to fire her for it. @JacksonLeeTX18 She should have thought about her words more carefully, as others are doing to her what she suggested they do to Trump cabinet members. #Karma
@RepJayapal "Fighting for the soul of our country" must be the latest liberal talking point. @RepJayapal I've seen three different congresswomen tweet it. Yet, no one can tell me why it's okay to rip a child away from its mother during an abortion.

@SenGillibrand @realDonaldTrump How are their lives on the line? Less than 2% of abortions are performed due to rape or the health of the mother. @SenGillibrand Statistically speaking, abortion kills more people.

@SenFeinstein 98% of abortions are performed because pregnancy is inconvenient for the mother. People need to have some self control. Your decision is made IN THE BEDROOM. If people would stop diddling around like jackrabbits, pregnancy probably wouldn't be a problem for so many.
@SenatorShaheen Life is a constitutional right, in case you forgot.

@SenKamalaHarris Voters, don't believe this! I worked at a pro-life pregnancy center. Free health services performed by medical doctors and registered nurses. Nobody hid any information, and nobody stood to profit from any advice given. @SenKamalaHarris Go to your local center and ask for a tour.
@Chet_Cannon @RepMaxineWaters Maxine Waters needs to be removed from her position immediately, investigated, and prosecuted. I wonder what she would do if this kind of nonsense happened to her or her family. She just sealed my vote for Trump in 2020.
@SenatorShaheen Hey voters... Don't believe this rhetortic. You can visit and tour your local pregnancy center. @SenShaheen They have nothing to hide. They also have better reputations than Planned Parenthood, who profits from your "choice," along with members of congress who support them.
@SenatorShaheen This is false. Pro-life pregnancy centers offer free health services for women by registered nurses and medical doctors. I worked at one. They also tell women what really happens during an abortion, (medically speaking) and do not stand to profit from their advice to women.
@SenGillibrand Pro-life pregnancy centers tell women what really happens during an abortion. And, they do not profit from the advice they give to women. Abortion centers should have to tell women about other options. This works both ways.
@SenGillibrand Maybe you should control your bodies by not having unprotected sex. Once pregnancy has occured, your choice has already been made. Pro-life pregnancy centers do not deceive anyone. I worked at one.
@SenSanders Islam is not a race. I suggest you read the qu'ran for yourself before you embarass yourself further. Then, you can look at statistics on terrorist attacks in America. @SenSanders Facts are pesky things.

@SenFeinstein I worked at a pro-life pregnancy center. They absolutely do tell people all their options. They also tell the truth about what really happens during an abortion. @SenFeinstein Maybe abortion clinics should be forced to tell people about adoption? About the risks of abortion?
