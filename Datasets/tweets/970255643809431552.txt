@RepMaxineWaters Without illegal aliens you don‚Äôt have enough power behind you with people to move anybody. Every day more and more Americans wake up to what you guys have been doing in our government. Drug trafficking, sex trafficking, human trafficking and pedophile rings. #removetheDemocrats
@RepMaxineWaters You are the multimillionaire that we need to watch the purse with. You have miss used and abused your position as a politician for years to benefit your own self and your family. You are a traitor to America and its citizens. A criminal to your state. #removetheDemocrats
@RepMaxineWaters Jesse Smollett was a friend of yours! He was a friend of president Obamas and Kamala Harris also.  You all set that whole thing up to try to make MAGA people look bad. You guys are a total freak show. You are not leaders. That‚Äôs why we needed President Trump. #removetheDemocrats
@KamalaHarris The real injustice for Americans is the Democrat Party. You spread lies, set up false flags like Jussie Smollett, smear other politician, racism against conservatives and refuse to take care of the citizens who pay your wage. #removetheDemocrats

@SenSchumer @realDonaldTrump You Democrats have the same buzz words in your tweets. Always to the extreme. Always blaming or smearing or whining about someone or something that hindered you from doing your work. You got voted into Congress in case you forgot. That means you and Republicans legislate. Job?
@PattyMurray You keep repeating the sad stories. It must be for indoctrination purposes. Is that how you control your base through indoctrinating them? All of you post exact same topics and format. Seems somewhat cultish. No individual thought?

@SpeakerPelosi You are acting like a child again. You know we need more wall and if it‚Äôs not in your proposal POTUS won‚Äôt sign it. If futility is your purpose, you have accomplished your goal. If your goal is to take care of the American citizens you will put legislation of $5.7bill for wall
@SpeakerPelosi You paint a picture of President Trump that is false. Americans know for a fact it‚Äôs not true. You can research and find the accomplishments of him and his administration. You have lied and embittered your base against their fellow citizens and the president. Do nothing 4them?
@SpeakerPelosi You have never worked for the people. You tell the black people you‚Äôve been working for them. The unemployment of the black people was so high until President Trump came into office. You use them like you use LGBT and women. Your goal is to fill your pockets -take care of people
@SpeakerPelosi You definitely have not read much of Dr. King‚Äôs great works. You‚Äôre just giving lip service because you are nothing like Dr. King. He was a man of great love and compassion.

@SenatorCantwell @USCG You Democrats are well acquainted with all of the problems that the shut down is causing individuals and families. The problem is you‚Äôre the one that can bring the answers and you refuse to negotiate. A plan was laid out yesterday and rejected before it was even completed.
@SenWarren Very good ideas if you would institute them for the American citizens. Instead you protect illegal aliens and refuse to close the border that brings in drugs and human trafficking. You Democrats act like you care about citizens of America but your actions are opposite!

@SenWhitehouse @SenateGOP You guys are so stupid I think you put your brain on repeat. You posted the same thing yesterday and the day before that in the day before that. I have found the Democratic Party specifically to be the lowest IQ people in America.

You were there when Nancy Pelosi told President Trump that she would not put one dollar towards the border wall. $54 billion you Democrats voted for foreign aid. You voted for a wall for Jordon to be built. Constantly lying to the American people!

@RonWyden I‚Äôm glad you finally realize this shut down was crazy from the beginning. If you would do what you have sworn an oath to do which is represent American citizens and their interests, there would‚Äôve never been a shut down! The concern you truly have for humanity is disgusting.
@PattyMurray Your tweet almost makes me sick at my stomach. You are my representative who has never represented me. You‚Äôve helped destroy our economy and legislate slavery. Don‚Äôt try to act like you care! We in your home state know the truth. We will be ready next time you run for office.
@SenKamalaHarris It is really hard to be nice to you. You lie and deceive so much in your interviews and on your Twitter but it becomes sickening. You are supposed to be a servant of your state and instead you are a slave to globalist leaders, Special interest groups and corporations.
@SenFeinstein Fact: 60,000 a month come across the southern border. over 700,000 that have overstayed their visas. You‚Äôre just a little deceptive by acting like the overstays are the only ones. Access to the Internet has exposed the lying, deceiving and manipulating from Congressman like you

@SenFeinstein That is because of the hard work that he has put into closing that border up. You wanted it open so you can continue to make your money off of the drug trafficking and sex trafficking rings. You have committed many crimes against the American people Soon you will be exposed.
@SenatorMenendez You were the one using it for a bargaining chip. You refuse to fund the border wall for $5 billion and spend $54 billion on for an eight to Mexico for women‚Äôs abortions. You Democrats are playing political games because you‚Äôre making money off the human and drug trafficking.

Could it be that the Democrats and some Republicans do not want to close the border is because they are a part of this human trafficking and drug trafficking? It is insane that we have had a border unprotected for so many years and so many illegals taking advantage of us.

@ChuckGrassley keep your word and investigate Diane Feinstein for her involvement in the Kavanagh hearings!
@realDonaldTrump Just keep your word!
@SenSchumer @realDonaldTrump How many of you live behind walls around your homes? Pelosi has a big one. Congress passed legislation to fund $25 billion for projects and development in Mexico. Yet You refuse to protect American citizens with a wall.
@SenSchumer @realDonaldTrump You refuse to support American citizens with a wall yet vote to spend $25 billion on Mexico.
@realDonaldTrump You talked so big about getting the boarder wall built yet now you backed down from Congress. Are you a liar like Congress?
@NancyPelosi @realDonaldTrump What kind of a lie will you make up about your brother-in-law and the $737 million he‚Äôs guaranteed on a solar energy project?
@NancyPelosi @RepRoybalAllard @realDonaldTrump @realDonaldTrump Will shut the government down because you won‚Äôt give the money to build the wall. You live with a wall around your home that 6 foot high and you don‚Äôt want to wall for us to be protected! You are a phony and everyone knows it.
@NancyPelosi I find it unusual for you to be doing any celebrating with the Jewish people. You Democrats have people in office now that are anti-somatic. Maxine Waters goes to church with Louis Farrakhan who despises Jews. The fake news media can‚Äôt hide all of The Democrats bad behavior.
@NancyPelosi I‚Äôd like to play back some of the comments you made about George W. Bush when he was in office. It wouldn‚Äôt have such a nice ring to it!
@NancyPelosi You‚Äôre lying again. The Democrats have been in control many times and never done anything about immigration. It‚Äôs always been used as a political pond by the Democrats and Republicans. Democrats and Republicans both are owned by corporations and special interest groups.
@NancyPelosi You are out right lying about the economy. I‚Äôm amazed that you would post things that can be proved to be wrong. I think you think people are stupid. Who did you lie to to get your husband The $737 million job that your brother-in-law‚Äôs second in command at?
@NancyPelosi @realDonaldTrump I love to read your posts you‚Äôre so phony. Your husband is getting $737 million for a project you have your brother-in-law second in command on and you think we believe you care about the weak the hurting the needy the women or any other group you can use for your own self gain
@NancyPelosi @RepRoybalAllard @realDonaldTrump It‚Äôs your fault the government being shut down. President Trump simply wants to do the job he was voted in for. You refuse to allow him to have the money to build the wall. We all can see what‚Äôs happening at the border. You‚Äôre a joke!
@NancyPelosi @FCC You do not listen to the people. You listen to a globalist society of Democrats that undermine our very society. You are all advancing your own self gain and that of your family members. $737 million paid to your husband on a job that your brother-in-law is second in command
@NancyPelosi You honor the spark of divinity in no one. You proclaim many things on Twitter and out in the public but in the back room you scheme and trick to enhance your family. $737 million you are letting your husband get on a project that your brother-in-law is second in command.
@NancyPelosi @HouseDemocrats The all out assault against the American people was the day that you said you would have to pass it to find out what‚Äôs in it. That‚Äôs your precious Obama care that just got shut down! The Republicans will give us good health care!
@NancyPelosi Nancy Pelosi you have no respect. You use your position for your own self gain and for your own personal power. $737 million to your husband of taxpayer dollars on a project that your brother-in-law is second in command on. You‚Äôre a joke!
@NancyPelosi @SecretaryZinke What is shameless Nancy Pelosi is that your husband is getting $737 million for a project that your brother-in-law is second in command on. That‚Äôs a real shame less behavior!
@NancyPelosi @RepMGS @RepSarbanes Let‚Äôs talk about integrity!!! Your husband is getting $737 million for a project that your brother-in-law is second in command on. Do we think you‚Äôre going to bring integrity to the house of representatives? Not!
