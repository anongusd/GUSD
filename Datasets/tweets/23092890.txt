@AriLamstein (3/3) We have taken the 2018 test and continue to take it seriously, and have incorporated all necessary measures to maintain the confidentiality and privacy of the respondent data.
@AriLamstein (2/3) We are working closely with our office of information security to ensure that we implement up-to-date security protocols, and address any compliance issues based on continuous monitoring of all systems in production supporting the 2018 test.
@AriLamstein (1/3) Hi Ari, we are continuing to use the commercial Cloud solution along with our data center, and the network and security operations centers are operational supporting production activities.
The key objective of performance and scalability testing for the #2020Census is to maximize early issue identification and to deliver resolution.
We’re determining the workloads for each #2020Census operation, system and interface through demand models. These models ensure optimal sizing of infrastructure.
We’re continuing to work with industry and federal partners to strengthen our #cybersecurity posture. #2020Census
https://t.co/cSqgXARZu3
Based on the Integrated Master Schedule, we’re on track to deliver #2020Census support systems. This includes:	-delivering tabulation results from PL 94-171	-planning, coordinating and executing logistics services for IT equipment
We are using a hybrid cloud solution in support of the #2020Census.
The 2020 Census website is expected to go live on March 29, 2019. We will have our one-year out event on April 1, 2019 as we countdown to the #2020Census.

The focus of the #2020Census Integrated Partnership and Communications program is to encourage self-response—preferably online—and raise and keep awareness high throughout the entire 2020 Census to encourage response. https://t.co/kh2SYPNrWs
The mindsets are: Eager Engagers, Fence Sitters, Confidentiality Minded, Head Nodders, Wary Skeptics, and Disconnected Doubters.
#2020 CBAMS Survey responses unveiled six mindsets in the US population that range from highly knowledgeable and likely to participate to disconnected and unlikely to respond. https://t.co/bprrBuQ0Z7
Our focus groups revealed that trusted voices &amp; organizations with community roots may facilitate participation among the most skeptical by providing information about community funding, the census process, &amp; by assuring people their participation in the #2020Census is safe.
Respondents ranked "helps determine funding for public services in my community" as the strongest motivator to complete the census, yet only 45% of people know that the census is actually used for this purpose.
The purpose of the #2020Census Barriers, Attitudes, and Motivators Study (CBAMS) is to understand the attitudes toward the census, barriers that may inhibit participation, and motivators that may facilitate self response.
Remember, if you have a question during the updates, send an email to: 2020.census.pmr@census.gov
The 2019 Census Test is on schedule and data collection operations will begin in mid-June for a July 1 Census Day in 2019. #2020Census

The Post-Enumeration Survey plans to release national coverage estimates of people about 18 months after Census Day, which is 7 months earlier than the 2010 schedule.
Our Post Enumeration Survey will be more automated than in 2010. Instead of paper address listings, we’ll use an automated listing and map instrument.
Last fall, we decided to leverage the expertise of our existing household surveys to conduct the Post-Enumeration Survey field operations instead of building new systems. As we did in 2010, we plan to conduct a separate survey in Puerto Rico.
The capture-recapture method was first developed to estimate the number of fish in a lake. It has been modified to estimate census coverage. Learn more about coverage measurement by watching this video: https://t.co/JcvdKPY78G https://t.co/nMricVCh32
DYK that after the census we conduct a Post-Enumeration Survey? This will help assess the accuracy of the #2020Census and inform plans for future censuses.

The Census Bureau has been actively managing risks for decennial censuses since the 2010 cycle. Over the past decade we have strengthened our procedures. Watch live as we highlight many of our improvements: https://t.co/ohGVSpoIj2
The #2020Census is a program consisting of multiple projects that rely on facilities, people, materials, systems, data, procedures, and contracts with the goal to count everyone once, only once, and in the right place. Learn more: https://t.co/ohGVSpoIj2
Watch our live webcast to learn more about key functions supported by Census key systems for the #2020Census. https://t.co/ohGVSpoIj2
Service-Based Enumeration is how we count people experiencing homelessness or using transitional shelters, soup kitchens, etc. AND also targeted nonsheltered outdoor locations (TNSOLS). During the 2018 Census Test, 36 TNSOLS were added by our Partnership Specialists.
For the #2020Census we're introducing an e-response option for Group Quarters administrators to participate in the Census and provide data about group quarter residents.
Tune in now to learn more about group quarters data collection for the #2020Census. https://t.co/ohGVSpoIj2 https://t.co/8dzsx1kXBL
2018 Census Test Nonresponse Follow up Successes:	-Automated recruiting, hiring, and training	-Deployed user-friendly enumeration instrument	-Optimized case assignments and routing	-Reduced in-person follow up through the use of administrative records
We're using administrative records data to reduce in-person follow-up to empty housing units. In the 2018 Census Test, this reduced the workload by removing ~11,000 cases prior to any in-person follow-up.
Polish, French, Haitian Creole, Portuguese, and Japanese.
Census provided phone support for the 2018 Census Test in 8 languages: English, Spanish, Chinese (Mandarin &amp; Cantonese), Korean, Arabic, Russian, Vietnamese, and Tagalog. For the 2020, an additional 5 languages will be added for phone and internet self-response:
27%: Proportion of housing units in the 2018 Census Test that received bilingual materials in English and Spanish.
6 in 10 of those who responded to the test in Providence did so online: https://t.co/rxDEAQgX35
In the 2018 Census Test:	•About 70% of the housing units received a letter inviting them to respond online 	•About 30% of the housing units received a paper questionnaire as part of their initial mailing.	ALL non respondents received a paper questionnaire in the fourth mailing.

“As of this week, 39 states or state-equivalents have formed 2020 Census Complete Count Committees, and an additional 11 are considering forming committees.” says Albert E. Fontenot, Jr., Associate Director for Decennial Census Programs
We are planning to hire media specialists, language specialists, Congressional liaisons, and people with specific skills in digital media and web.
#2020Census: Where Are We Now: Area census offices are scheduled to open in January 2019 and more offices are scheduled to open between June and September 2019.
“We are continuing to focus on the key elements that will ensure that we are able to conduct a successful and high quality Census in 2020
The primary objective of the test was to evaluate &amp; “prove” the new technology. Specifically, “to test and validate 2020 Census operations, procedures, systems and field infrastructure to ensure proper integration and conformance with functional and non-functional requirements.”
In 2010 the only way to respond was by filling out and mailing a paper questionnaire.  In 2020 we are expecting the largest percentage of our self‑response to come through the internet – the test in Providence showed over 60% of our self‑response came through the internet.
“‘You can trust that your information is safe.’ This has been a fundamental part of the Census DNA.” says Albert E. Fontenot, Jr., Associate Director for Decennial Census Programs

@kangletwin In 2012, there was a need to collapse the categories of certain variables due to data disclosure requirements. The variables remain the same in 2013-2016 as they were in 2012. MIGSP is one of those variables. I'm unsure if that has something to do with why those columns are blank
Way to grow! Among counties with a #population of 10,000 or more in 2016 and 2017, Falls Church City, Va. (a county equivalent), was the fastest-growing county with a 5.2% increase, adding 715 people. https://t.co/UJSTIKujEz

@therealSoKawaii The Census Bureau will not use a combined question format for collecting race and ethnicity, or a separate “Middle Eastern or North African” category on the census form.
@therealSoKawaii In keeping with OMB standards, the planned race and ethnicity questions for the 2020 Census will follow a two-question format for capturing race and ethnicity. We are also using the two-question format during the 2018 End-to-End Census Test.
@therealSoKawaii Good morning! In the decennial census and across all Census Bureau surveys, we must follow the most recent race and ethnicity standards for the federal government set by the OMB, which remain unchanged since 1997.

@MetroGram New projections incorporate newer data about trends in births, deaths, and migration. We do not base them off of policy changes or try to predict big historical events. #CensusChat
@valleyventana Bottom line: Projected demographic changes could affect demand for healthcare, in-home care, assisted living facilities and other forms of support, such as Social Security and family caregiving. #CensusChat
@valleyventana This report gives you a look at what the U.S. might look like in the future. The country is going to age quickly, and become more racially and ethnically diverse.
@PRBdata We account for the health differences by projecting mortality by race/ethnic group, and we include nativity because the foreign-born tend to live longer. #CensusChat
@legacy_comm @pewresearch We don't officially define generations. We have age data available by single year of age, so you can use our data to create specific age ranges. #CensusChat https://t.co/ccehoOcieq
A2-3: Figure 4 from the report shows more: https://t.co/Iou8uXPzu9. #CensusChat https://t.co/Dg3pwKle0l
A2-2: As baby boomers age into later life, the number of deaths is projected to rise faster than births. So the population will naturally grow very slowly, leaving immigration to become the leading cause of population growth after 2030. #CensusChat
A2-1: Today, about 14% of the U.S. population is foreign born and we project that number will grow to 17% by 2060, surpassing the previous historic high of 15% from 1890. #CensusChat
A2: We project that levels of international migration will remain relatively flat in coming decades. Nevertheless, the country is still projected to grow more from migration than natural increase beginning in 2030. #CensusChat
Q2: Are you projecting an increase or decrease in immigration in the future? #CensusChat
@valleyventana Although we don't officially define generations, births are projected to decrease in the future. #CensusChat
@valleyventana The U.S. will not age as fast as Japan because international migration rates are projected to be higher for the U.S. than for Japan. #CensusChat
@valleyventana The elderly population in the U.S. is projected to triple by 2060 as birth rates are projected to decline. #CensusChat
@SamKleinOnline The projections use historical trends in the number of births, deaths, and international migrants to project the future population. The projections change as the assumptions about the future change. For more on #2020census visit https://t.co/w39XOE1S2e. #CensusChat
@SamKleinOnline Our population projections do not account for changes in how people identify their race/ethnicity. #CensusChat

@valleyventana We project there will be 3.5 working-age people for every retirement-age person in 2020, but just 2.5 workers for every retiree by 2060. #CensusChat
@valleyventana Projected demographic changes could affect demand for healthcare, in-home care, assisted living facilities and other forms of support, such as Social Security and family caregiving. #CensusChat
A1-4: By 2060, we’re projecting that nearly 1 in 4 Americans will be 65 or older. There will be 95 million older Americans compared to 80 million children under 18. #CensusChat
A1-3: The baby boomers are aging into older adulthood and as one of the largest generations in the U.S., that means that a growing proportion of the country will be an older adult. #CensusChat
A1-2: (Cont'd) In less than two decades, we’re projecting that older adults will outnumber kids for the first time in U.S. history. #CensusChat
@PRBdata We use the International Data Base to take into account projected pop growth by world region in order to calculate international migration to the US. #CensusChat https://t.co/niaBmaK8Vk
We’re projecting that the population will grow by 78 million people between today and 2060. In 2058, we’ll cross over the 400-million threshold. At the same time that the population will keep growing, it’s going to age rapidly. #CensusChat https://t.co/XBGaVdRUpG

@librarydavid If you were to investigate these 28 tracts, you should find that each contains 1 or more of the exclusionary criteria for determining poverty status, such as including a college dorm, nursing home, etc. We hope this helps!
@librarydavid At low levels of geo such as tracts, many records do not hit any of the exclusionary criteria for determining poverty status, thus resulting in the same effective sub pop in question. However, looking across all 398 tracts in King Co., there were 28 in which the sub pops differ.
@librarydavid The section for 'Workers Age 16 and Over for Whom Poverty Status Is Determined' ignores earnings but excludes: Unrelated Persons Under 15 Years, Institutionalized GQ Persons, College Dorm GQ Persons, Military Barracks GQ Persons, and GQ Person Under 15 Years.
@librarydavid The section for 'Workers Age 16 and Over' is based on the employed civilian or non civilian population age 16 and over. The section for 'Workers Age 16 and Over with Earnings' further limits this to those who had earnings.
@librarydavid Hi David! We apologize for the delay. The tables display the correct data. The reason the tables appear to erroneously report the same data for multiple sections of the table is due to nuanced differences between  the universes in question.

Thank you for participating in our Twitter chat today! Please continue the conversation &amp; share your thoughts #CensusChat
@CNDAPL5 The survey is nationally representative.
@TessaKeough We added this question to the survey in response to stakeholder interest on the topic. The data are publicly available.
@TessaKeough Thank you! We want our data to be used by the general public, researchers, and policy makers, just to name a few.
These measures from our multiple partner fertility report can then be used in a wide variety of social and demographic research. #CensusChat
We continually evolve our measures to better and more accurately represent people and households in the U.S. #CensusChat
Q4: What questions do you have about our multiple partner fertility report? #CensusChat
A3: Check out this demographic portrait of multiple partner fertility in the United States: https://t.co/SLOXMIbxCH. #CensusChat https://t.co/zPiBJMrmc4
A3: &lt; 1/2 of all MPF mothers are married at the time of the survey &amp; only about a third are married &amp; have kids w/their spouse. #CensusChat
A3: 61.8% of MPF fathers are married at the time of the interview &amp; about 1/2 (48.2%) also have kids w/their current spouse. #CensusChat
A3: The average age at entry into multiple partner fertility is 26 for women and just under 30 for men. #CensusChat
A3: A higher percentage of mothers in their 20s have MPF than do fathers in their 20s (16% compared to 10 %). #CensusChat
@TessaKeough No problem! Multiple partner fertility parents are more likely to be in poverty than are all adults or all parents.
A3: &gt; 1 in 6 MPF parents (18.4%) lives in a household below poverty, compared to 12.4% of all adults &amp; 11.5% of all parents #CensusChat
A3: Multiple partner fertility parents are more likely be in poverty than are all adults or all parents. #CensusChat
A3: Among unmarried couples living with a child&lt;18, about 44% include MPF (one or both partners). #CensusChat
@JaneyTheSmall Data about divorce and marriage are available for everyone 15+ in the SIPP 2014.
A3: Among married couples living with a child&lt;18, about 22% include MPF (one or both spouses). #CensusChat
Q3: What are the demographics of multiple partner fertility? #CensusChat
@BarryParksJr Glad to hear that! Have you checked out #StatsinSchools? https://t.co/DwfVgoFK62
@JaneyTheSmall For this report, we used age 15+for our adult sample. You are welcome to download the data &amp; do your own analysis: https://t.co/FEOtIQLw6f
A2: 31% of single parents living with a child under 18 have multiple partner fertility. #CensusChat
A2: 14% of partnered parents (married or cohabiting) living with a child under 18 have multiple partner fertility. #CensusChat
A2: 8.4% of kids under 18 living with two biological parents have a half sibling in the house. #CensusChat
A2: 15.6% of kids under 18 living with two biological parents have a half sibling who lives elsewhere. #CensusChat
A2: Among cohabiting opposite sex couples, MPF is more common; in 27.6% of these couples, one or both partners has MPF. #CensusChat
@JaneyTheSmall The data are produced and made publicly available for a variety of purposes.
A2: For married opposite sex couples, 19.2% include at least 1 partner who has MPF. #CensusChat
@TessaKeough (2/2) to include a direct question about multiple partner fertility.
@TessaKeough (1/2) Historical prevalence is hard to measure because the 2014 SIPP is the first nationally-representative survey
@TessaKeough There are efforts in the Census to eliminate duplicate records. These estimates reflect  counts for adults.
A2: Among mothers with 2 or more kids, 21.6% have multiple partner fertility, while 19.3% of fathers of 2 or more kids do. #CensusChat
@JaneyTheSmall We're always working to improve our measurement of families and households to reflect the experiences of people in the U.S.
A2: Roughly one in five parents of two or more children (20.6%) have children with more than one partner. #CensusChat
@TessaKeough We're always working to improve our measurement of families and households to reflect the experiences of people in the U.S.
A2: These estimates include all parents ages 15 and up regardless of whether they live with any or all of their children. #CensusChat
A2: About 1 in every 6 parents (15.7%) have multiple partner fertility. Among mothers it’s 16.6%, while it’s 14.6% among fathers #CensusChat
A2: 10.1% of all adults age 15 or older have had children with more than one partner, or roughly one out of every 10 adults. #CensusChat https://t.co/SHTHSfxS6R
Q2: What is the prevalence of multiple partner fertility in the U.S.? #CensusChat
A1: MPF families are complex and are almost always spread across multiple homes. Measuring the prevalence has been difficult. #CensusChat
A1: MPF is not a new phenomenon; widowhood, divorce, and separation are all common precursors of fertility in a second union #CensusChat
A1: A person who has multiple partner fertility is someone who has had biological children with more than one partner. #CensusChat https://t.co/jLbAKnt1yX
