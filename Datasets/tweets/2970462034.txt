This is disgraceful and sad. Our President is defending a brutal dictator whose regime imprisoned, tortured and killed an American citizen.		First Putin, then MBS, and now Kim Jung Un. Someone needs to inform the President that kowtowing is not the same as diplomacy. https://t.co/8uzs7eyNEZ
TONIGHT: We're hosting a #TownHall at 7:00 PM tonight at South Side High School. Hope to see you there! https://t.co/JJ30h4wB2E

The House just passed a bipartisan resolution to uphold the separation of powers in our country and end Trump's #FakeEmergency.		The Senate must pass this bill and send a clear message that Congress won't allow the President to subvert the Constitution. https://t.co/4owjaGPwCn
Today we're voting on @JoaquinCastrotx's resolution to stop Trump’s #FakeEmergency. I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle &amp; in both chambers to support this bill. This isn't a partisan issue, it's a constitutional one. We need to defend our coequal branch of government.
This statement is total nonsense. Not a single legitimate argument against either bill. Just more #NRA pandering. 		Pathetic and dangerous, but not at all surprising for an administration that's been bought by nearly every special interest in town. https://t.co/il0tDJUvJ0
I'm proud to support legislation to fully fund the 9/11 Victim Compensation Fund &amp; make it permanent. 		We can never turn our backs on the brave first responders who answered the call that day and in the days after.		I urge all my colleagues to support this bill. #Renew911VCF

There should never have been any confusion on this. Our veterans deserve clarity and the assurance that they will be made whole. They deserve answers. 		Anything less is unacceptable. https://t.co/GHOBnd2A4X

Just as an aside - I find it fascinating that the very people who are characterizing our call for new leadership as a sexist campaign are also ignoring the women leading the charge.		Are @RepMarciaFudge and I white men? https://t.co/wOV7zed4jV

Today, @RepBrianMast &amp; I introduced a bipartisan bill that would change the VA's motto to make it more inclusive of women veterans.		The brave women who have worn our nation's uniform deserve to be equally embraced by the agency meant to support them. https://t.co/WqXTRWcFQ7

As we marked 100 years since the end of WWI, I laid a wreath at the gravesite of New York native Nurse Alice Hagadorn in Suresnes, France. She served bravely on the front lines during the war.

We learned a lot of hard lessons after Sandy. This is an important, bipartisan bill that will make the storm recovery process fairer, more transparent and less burdensome for future storm survivors. 		https://t.co/HuEC7Nb0Jq

The first tax bill capped state &amp; local tax deductions &amp; hurt hard-working families in #NY04. The new tax package makes that cap permanent.		This isn't a "2.0" bill - it's just more of the same bad policy &amp; it won't even get a vote in the Senate.  		Yet another @HouseGOP PR stunt

It's been 1 year since Trump terminated #DACA. Since then, @SpeakerRyan hasn't taken any action to protect Dreamers. Instead, he introduced 2 right-wing immigration bills that failed.		We could resolve this today if @HouseGOP had the courage to bring up a bipartisan solution.
Once again, Republicans are trying to eliminate protections for Americans with pre-existing conditions. They want to restore a system where providers can discriminate &amp; deny care to those who need it most. Make no mistake, this is an attack on working families. #ProtectOurCare
Happy #LaborDay! Today we celebrate the contributions of all American workers, past and present. Tomorrow we keep up the fight for workers' rights and equality in the workplace.
President Trump wants people to think that Michael Cohen didn't actually commit a crime. That would be pretty convenient for him. 		But he's flat-out wrong and his claims are a direct attack on our rule of law.		@RepTedLieu &amp; I set the record straight: https://t.co/tKRxr3iGAY

Deeply saddened to hear of John McCain’s passing. This is truly a national tragedy. Senator McCain served, he sacrificed and he persisted. His voice was and should continue to be a moral compass for our country. I’m praying for his family tonight. May he rest in peace.
Senator McCain is a true patriot and public servant. His strength, independence and unwavering sense of duty should inspire us all. I'm praying for him and the entire McCain family.
I was a prosecutor for 20+ years. Cooperating witnesses play a crucial role in exposing the truth and bringing criminals to justice - often at great personal risk. And those who try to denigrate and silence them often have something to hide. https://t.co/rBXIgWyLDX
Teachers are asking for raises, new books &amp; more money for school supplies. 		Besty DeVos wants to buy them guns.

Revoking Brennan's security clearance is pettiness at the expense of national security. We always knew @realDonaldTrump had a fragile ego, but this shows just how far he’s willing to go to silence critics &amp; trample the 1st amendment. His priorities get more misguided by the day.
Today I met with the Sokolow family to discuss the Anti-terrorism Clarification Act, which recently passed in the House. This bill would finally allow victims of terrorism to seek justice.

Earlier this year, @RepTedLieu and I called on the FBI to investigate these exact payments. We believe they may have violated campaign finance laws. Now it appears the President had direct knowledge. Our letter to the FBI Director: https://t.co/jwmLLWIwWA https://t.co/KYdVd9tKNM
Few members of Congress have more credibility on this issue than my colleague @HurdOnTheHill. A smart piece that calls for bipartisan action to counter Russian aggression &amp; election interference. Couldn't agree more. https://t.co/KnBLpFyqcy
Today @RepStefanik &amp; I called on @POTUS to appoint an Election Security Czar. The threat of continued interference is urgent &amp; real. We need to make sure our federal agencies are working together &amp; sharing information. Our letter:  https://t.co/iNtXV1Zuey
American citizens are not bargaining chips. The fact that @POTUS even entertained the idea of letting Russia interrogate @McFaul &amp; @Billbrowder is a total betrayal of our diplomatic corps &amp; values. If he had any loyalty or courage he would have swiftly rejected this request.
In May, @RepTedLieu &amp; I sent a letter to the FBI calling for an investigation into Russian ties to the NRA.

My statement on why we need an Election Security Czar: https://t.co/QtG2b2I97y
This is not a thing of the past. Our intel community confirmed that Russia is actively trying to interfere in the 2018 election. Yet, @POTUS continues to believe Putin over our own experts. His actions today weren't just shameful, they were dangerous &amp; potentially treasonous. https://t.co/p8C9Mgp7MM
Whether or not @POTUS addressed Russia's interference in our election during his meeting with Putin is irrelevant, because this is how he continues to frame the topic.		The President does not care that Russia attacked our democracy. And that's a total betrayal to our country. https://t.co/HMS6mBi5q2
WATCH: When asked if they agree w/ the intel community's assessment that Russia interfered in the 2016 election 2/4 @DHSgov officials had "no opinion." Officials who cannot acknowledge this fact are not equipped to protect our elections in 2018 &amp; 2020. 		https://t.co/zXXv7cY5iW
Yesterday, @USRepKeating and I questioned senior DHS officials about Russian interference in the 2016 election &amp; they refused to state definitively that Russia was responsible. Today, DOJ indicted 12 Russian military &amp; intelligence officers for hacking. 	https://t.co/ohLSqeFVpb
My amendment to the Intel Authorization Act passed yesterday. It'll require @ODNIgov &amp; @USTreasury to develop a threat assessment report on terrorist use of virtual currencies. We need to give law enforcement the resources they need to counter this threat. https://t.co/RYAG6tATkZ

The entire intel community acknowledges that Russia interfered in the 2016 elections. Yet President Trump's words &amp; actions give us no reason to believe he will hold Putin accountable in their upcoming meeting. His response so far has been a total joke.
In a @HouseHomeland hearing on Election Security where DHS Under Secretary Krebs says there is a concerted effort by Russia to interfere in our 2018 elections. But instead of working w/ our partners in Europe to confront Russia, @POTUS insults our allies &amp; downplays this threat.
Meanwhile, the Trump Admin failed to meet the deadline set by a federal judge to reunite all separated children under the age of 5 w/ their families. @SecNielsen has no business representing our nation abroad while, under her watch, thousands of families remain separated. https://t.co/lxeYudhxyx
150 years ago, the 14th Amendment was ratified, establishing equal protection under the law. It has since been used as the basis for landmark decisions on desegregation, abortion rights &amp; marriage equality. This is why we need a SCOTUS nominee who will respect legal precedent.
Disgusting to see the President mock the #MeToo movement, but not surprising coming from an admitted sexual predator with a lifetime history of disparaging, harassing, &amp; abusing women.	https://t.co/FmCogkBq8w
I’ve seen firsthand how @HouseGOP has failed to hold ICE accountable for its actions. We have not had 1 hearing on ICE this Congress. Instead of abolishing ICE, we should focus on reforming it &amp; increasing oversight to restore ICE's intended purpose: keeping America safe. 5/5
Last week 19 senior ICE investigators raised this concern publicly. They asked @SecNielsen to separate the investigative branch because the President’s policy has drained their resources, harmed their reputation &amp; undermined their work. 4/5 	https://t.co/lpNag9QYnv
The Trump Admin is clearly misusing ICE resources to fulfill its political motives instead of actually empowering ICE investigators who play a critical role in keeping Americans safe from drug cartels, violent gangs, sex traffickers &amp; cyber criminals. 3/5
Calls to abolish ICE are only shifting the conversation away from the real problems facing our immigration &amp; asylum systems. Problems that the President himself created, including the separation of thousands of children from their families. And that’s exactly what he wants. 2/5
THREAD: No question that ICE is in need of serious reform. The policies it’s prioritizing today don't reflect its primary mission or our values. But abolishing ICE without changing President Trump’s zero-humanity policy won’t solve the problem or undo the trauma it’s caused. 1/5
This is what happens when you have the Trump Admin actively working to sabotage the Affordable Care Act. The federal government should be supporting state health care exchanges &amp; protecting people's coverage, not putting more burden on working families. https://t.co/KWXi1f00kK

Devastated by the #Janus decision. This hands a victory to corporate interests &amp; will hurt working families. American workers are stronger when they unite to improve their wages, benefits, &amp; working conditions.
Another bad SCOTUS decision: #NIFLAvBecerra allows crisis pregnancy centers to give women biased &amp; inaccurate information about their health. I'm cosponsoring the Stop Deceptive Advertising for Women's Healthcare Services Act to end this dangerous &amp; intentional deception.
A bad decision by #SCOTUS does not change the fact that the travel ban is completely discriminatory &amp; does not make us any safer. All it does is legalize the president's openly xenophobic campaign promises. Shameful.
.@Newsday put it best: "It’s hard to imagine anyone fighting to return to a system that left many people with pre-existing conditions unable to buy health insurance..." 		How can the administration possibly defend this? #ProtectOurCare. https://t.co/AW7NTrLE6Y
After spending the day w/officials from @CBP &amp; @HHSGov, &amp; seeing the temporary shelters in #Tornillo, one thing is clear: we cannot wait until November to act on immigration. Congress can &amp; should pass a bipartisan solution now. Anyone who's been here understands the urgency.
Just wrapped up my visit to the #Tornillo facility with a bipartisan delegation. Securing our borders is critical, but we can't do so at the expense of our values. We are not a country that separates families, detains kids in tents or turns our back on those seeking asylum. https://t.co/QNz7u69EOj
Just finished a briefing with @CBP on border operations. Arriving now at the facility in #Tornillo, Texas where migrant children are being held.
2,300 kids were torn away from their families by our government. And there is still no plan for reuniting them. We shouldn’t be talking about anything else.
The Executive Order does nothing to address reunification. We need to continue holding this administration accountable and we need to know exactly how &amp; when they plan to reunite the families that have already been separated.
This week has shown the world frightening new levels of incompetence and	malevolence within the White House.
On #WorldRefugeesDay we are reminded of our moral obligation to help the world's most vulnerable people. Our nation is a beacon of hope for those fleeing violence &amp; persecution, and we cannot turn our back on them. Today we reaffirm our commitment to refugees everywhere.
I'm proud to be a cosponsor of the Keep Families Together Act. If you oppose the cruel practice of separating children from their parents then urge your representatives to support this bill too. #KeepFamiliesTogether
Jeff Sessions &amp; John Kelly spoke publicly of using family separation as a deterrent. Then 2,000 kids were separated from their parents. Now @SecNielsen is denying that this was a policy &amp; is absolving the admin of any responsibility. She's misleading the public &amp; should resign.
While you and your colleagues have been busy getting your half-baked story straight, there are 2,000 kids at the border who have in fact been separated from their families. Go see for yourself. Or better yet, just reunite them with their parents. This has to end. https://t.co/ZiUuo1gVmm

Truly relieved to hear that Pablo Villavicencio has been granted an emergency stay of removal. This is great news for him and his family. But there is still more work to do and we're not done fighting on their behalf. Incredible job by @LegalAidNYC! https://t.co/jkGk3toafm
Mr. Villavicencio is a hardworking family man - he shouldn't be in custody. @NydiaVelazquez and I are asking ICE's New York Field Office to grant his stay of removal &amp; release him immediately so that he can return to his wife &amp; daughters in Hempstead. https://t.co/PfXDa14btR
The VA's motto overlooks the service and sacrifice of women veterans. I proposed an amendment that would fix that, but it was never brought to the floor. Read More: https://t.co/M3hwsTt4aI
The brave women who serve our country and the families of those who gave their lives defending it deserve to be a part of an organization that recognizes their service and sacrifice. It baffles that any Member of Congress would disagree.
The number of women veterans in our country continues to rise, but still the VA’s official motto excludes women. That’s not right &amp; I tried to fix it, but my amendment was never brought to the floor for debate, let alone a vote.
Pablo’s detention represents everything that is wrong with the President’s immigration policy. Pablo did nothing wrong and posed no danger, but still this administration is more concerned with locking up a hardworking father of two than combating actual threats to our security.
Pablo Villavicencio’s arrest is outrageous and unacceptable. My office has been working with his wife Sandra, a resident of #NY04, and we've been in contact with ICE &amp; USCIS. We’ve assured Sandra that we’ll do everything in our power to stop his deportation and bring him home.

That being said, the only way to ensure LGBTQ Americans are protected from discrimination — whether it’s in a bakery or in housing, employment or public education — is to pass the Equality Act.
Today's #MasterpieceCakeshop ruling is disappointing, but it is NOT the sweeping "license to discriminate" that anti-LGBTQ extremists were looking for. SCOTUS affirmed LGBTQ civil rights &amp; acknowledged LGBTQ people have a right to live free from the indignity of discrimination.

What world are we living in when "senior Scouts source" has more credibility than the POTUS? https://t.co/90xZSAnq5I
And we're supposed to believe Trump knew NOTHING about this meeting &amp; was just trying to protect his son. Give me a break.
NYT breaks Don Jr./Russia story. Jr. wants to be honest (reportedly). But Trump DICTATES Jr.'s response, which is soon proved to be false.
Trump elected Pres., refuses to acknowledge Russian interference. No one tells him there's an email confirming Russian interference.
Trump &amp; Jr. spend a yr saying claims of Russian interference "fake news." No one ever tells Trump they have an email proving this is false.
Not like they weren't talking during this time. They were 3 of his top campaign advisers, &amp; want us to believe this mtg never even came up.
NONE of them even mentions this to DJT. No "hey Jr. what'd you do today?" "Nothing Dad, met some Russians but just about adoption." Nothing.
(We have *NO* reason to believe anything we've heard about what was/wasn't said, considering the credibility of those involved.)
So FreDon, JK, PM meet w/ this Russian lawyer, former Soviet counterintel officer, alleged Russian money launderer, who knows who else.
Don Jr. said "I love it," &amp; invited Kushner &amp; Manafort, who accepted the invitation. These are three TOP advisers to candidate Trump.
British knucklehead emailed (American knucklehead) Don Jr. in June '16 offering dirt on HRC as part of Russia &amp; its govt's support for Trump
Basically this is what the Trump admin wants us to believe about the Don Jr./Russia meeting... #TrumpRussia
So Trump's advisors wanted to be "truthful" about Jr./Russia meeting, but then Trump got involved &amp; decided to do the opposite. Shocking. https://t.co/PXGC05djvh

Bottom line: Trump talks, talks, talks about all the great things he'll do. But when he acts, he does the opposite.
Trump talks about clean air &amp; water, but #TrumpCuts #CleanPowerPlan funding, 50+ EPA programs, &amp; weakens enforcement of enviro crimes
Trump talks about national security, but #TrumpCuts $ for diplomacy &amp; foreign aid investments that help keep us safe.
Trump talks about fixing "inner cities," but #TrumpCuts $3B Community Devel Grants &amp; $1.1B to promote homeownership in low-income areas
Trump talks about helping disadvantaged students, but #TrumpCuts $ for after-school &amp; summer programs proven to help close achievement gap
Trump talks about creating jobs, but #TrumpCuts job placement &amp; training programs for people who need them most.
Trump talks about infrastructure investments, but #TrumpCuts funding for transit &amp; infrastructure projects.
To sum up: When you get past slogans &amp; into the details, Trump's #budget puts poorest Americans last &amp; does nothing to help working people
ARTS: #TrumpCuts $1 billion, completely eliminating @NEAarts, @NEHgov, @US_IMLS &amp; @CPBmedia.
HEALTH &amp; HUMAN SERVICES: #TrumpCuts $15.1 billion, including $5.8 billion for the National Institutes of Health
LEGAL SERVICES: #TrumpCuts would completely eliminate Legal Services Corp, which provides civil legal aid to low-income Americans nationwide
HUD: #TrumpCuts $6.2 BILLION. Eliminates $3B Community Devel Grants &amp; $1.1B for programs that promote homeownership in low-income areas
STATE: #TrumpCuts $10.9B, eliminates #climatechange prevention programs, reduces $ for peacekeeping, devel banks, cultural-exchange programs
HOMELAND SECURITY: #TrumpCuts $667 MILLION from state &amp; local FEMA grants for security enhancements &amp; disaster mitigation
#TrumpCuts $1.7B from Energy Dept, incl $900M from Ofc of Science, &amp; eliminates hundreds of millions in energy efficiency grant funding
#TrumpCuts $2.5B from EPA, eliminates $ for #CleanPowerPlan, eliminates 50+ key programs, weakens EPA's ability to enforce enviro crimes
CLIMATE CHANGE: #TrumpCuts $250M in Commerce programs that help coastal communities like LI prepare for rising sea levels &amp; extreme weather
TRANSPO: #TrumpCuts $2.4B, eliminates $ for new transit projects, cuts $499M from TIGER grants for transit infrastructure improvements
LABOR: #TrumpCuts $2.6B, eliminates program that helps low-income seniors find jobs, shrinks job-training program for disadvantaged youth
On top of those #TrumpCuts, #budget expands "school choice," diverting $ away from public schools &amp; students who need it most.
#TrumpCuts $9.2B in total education $, including another $2.4B in grants that help states train &amp; prepare teachers &amp; school officials.
EDUCATION: After-school &amp; summer programs are proven to help close the achievement gap, but #TrumpCuts $1.2 BILLION for these programs
