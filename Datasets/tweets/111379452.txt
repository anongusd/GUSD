We need an energy scientist in the Senate so Congress will stop fiddling and start acting on climate change to protect our future.
We need an energy plan that is ambitious because of the scale of the problem we face. #ActOnClimate http://t.co/XruUnE8u4M

We must not accept a view of a less fair, less supportive, less capable America to win the votes of those who would sell America short.
The President should demand that Congress pass a resolution to pay America‚Äôs debts or say he will do it without them.
Letting the Bush tax cuts expire would do more to reduce the deficit than either the Boehner or the Reid plan.
Getting Americans back to work would do more to help the economy and reduce the deficit than either the Boehner or the Reid plan.
We should pay our bills and then get on with our work to create jobs and improve the economy.
