11/11 Not everyone feels the same, though. 		Read more from our roundtable interview with members of tech companies’ trust and safety teams in our new tech and science publication, OneZero. https://t.co/8xfjiQRfZp
But despite all they look at, and the various criticisms they face, some trust and safety workers love their jobs because of the measurable impact they make. https://t.co/8xfjiQRfZp https://t.co/5fse0brwLX
One of the more frequent criticisms they receive is: “Who are you to decide what people can say?” Their responses differ, but overall there is an acknowledgment of the power they wield. Part of the job, they say, is wielding it responsibly. https://t.co/8xfjiQRfZp https://t.co/u7vKe0pfg7
At the same time, critics contend that human moderation is part of the problem, and can lead to take-down actions based on political bias. The trust and safety workers we spoke to reject that idea. https://t.co/8xfjiQRfZp https://t.co/gjSWzIKqZs
That's because the work itself takes a toll. They are real people looking at incredibly dark material for hours on end, despite criticism that algorithms or disinterested humans are behind the decisions. https://t.co/8xfjiQRfZp https://t.co/iVnEFPTWZl
Burnout, also, is a major contributor to people’s resignations. One trust and safety worker we spoke to thinks there should be limits to how long an employee is tasked with doing this work. https://t.co/8xfjiQRfZp https://t.co/CwmhCijeet
But often their jobs are more gravely serious. So much so that the things they see, and the decisions they sometimes have to make, factor heavily in some people's decision to leave the line of work. https://t.co/8xfjiQRfZp https://t.co/qJYttY709P
And the actions they take can have unintended consequences, like the time Etsy decided to ban spells, potions, readings, and anything else that promises some sort of cosmic outcome. https://t.co/8xfjiQRfZp https://t.co/fEKInbBvpy
Some of the things they see are odd. https://t.co/8xfjiQRfZp https://t.co/fgNanDxZAK
The day-to-day jobs of trust and safety teams vary, but there tend to be some consistencies: they look at problematic content posted on the platform, and decide —based on their rules, policies, and own moral compass—what should be done. https://t.co/8xfjiQRfZp https://t.co/JfdJM0ci5v
1/ Violence, mass shooting threats, information warfare. These are some of the things trust and safety teams at major tech companies police regularly. It's a hard job, made harder by the microscope they're currently under. Here, several open up about their work—and how they do it

These only scratch the surface. See who else made Tim Wu’s ‘Anti-Trust’s Most Wanted’ list here: https://t.co/L2VCXl475X
7. Ticketmaster-Live Nation		Anticompetitive behavior: Live Nation’s acquisition of Ticketmaster in 2010 created an events behemoth, which is now being investigated for punishing venues that replace Ticketmaster with cheaper or better ticketing options. https://t.co/L2VCXl475X https://t.co/3g15e1PWr4
6. Big Pharma		Anticompetitive and extortionary practices include abuse of patent rights and price gouging. (See also: Daraprim, the antiparasitic drug whose price was hiked under the leadership of Martin Shkreli) https://t.co/L2VCXl475X https://t.co/Pfsfp5mFpn
5. Google		Anticompetitive behavior: On its way to search monopoly, Google acquired advertising competitors iMob and Doubleclick, rival Waze and other potential competitors. It also copied (or, to some, stole) the reviews from “local” competitor Yelp. https://t.co/L2VCXl475X https://t.co/gAkCRehNxG
4. Facebook		Anticompetitive behavior: Facebook’s arguably illegal acquisition of Instagram and WhatsApp has led to increased advertising load, violation of privacy laws, failure to secure networks against manipulation, and suspicious blows to Snapchat. https://t.co/L2VCXl475X https://t.co/UkZGaWHWf9
3. Big Agriculture		Anticompetitive behavior: The consolidation of the agriculture industry into four global giants has led to the tripling of seed prices since the 1990s, and an increase in prices for fertilizer. https://t.co/L2VCXl475X https://t.co/lpJDA3fklP
2. AT&amp;T-WarnerMedia		Anticompetitive behavior: When Dish and Dish-Sling executives opposed AT&amp;T’s acquisition of Time-Warner and HBO, AT&amp;T yanked HBO from 2.5 million Dish customers who subscribed to the channel. https://t.co/L2VCXl475X https://t.co/2aj5hvU4Cc
1. Amazon. 		Anticompetitive behavior: Amazon's acquisition of competitors, bullying of smaller brands, aggressive use of 18-month noncompete, and more have led it to dominate 50% of the online retail market. https://t.co/L2VCXl475X https://t.co/9OlTbXOzaM
These are the firms or industries—and their anticompetitive behavior—that are ripe for investigation, according to Tim Wu. https://t.co/L2VCXl475X https://t.co/MUKhN4Wk0I
