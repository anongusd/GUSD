@AzeriTimes Azeris talk about territory but never about people who live, and have always, lived there, which indicates their survival is threatened. If living together is not possible to contemplate for Azeris, then it’s suicidal for Armenians to believe otherwise
@AzeriTimes Many Armenians who used to have more flexible positions re the buffer regions changed their minds after April 2016 &amp; the violent beheadings &amp; murders by Azeri troops. And the gung-ho attitudes of Azeris who don’t support Aliyev were especially troubling to me
@AzeriTimes I am all for an honest assessment without theatrics &amp; exaggeration, and also with a context that understands what is situationally unique. Azeris lack this ability, in my experience

Be still my heart https://t.co/42WCd6pqPE
@AzeriTimes Yes, if course there was deliberate destruction, as has happened in every war that’s ever taken place. Look at Dresden, for instance
@AzeriTimes That Armenian church is treated exactly as an exemplar for propaganda purposes; most other surviving churches are labeled Albanian. There are also Azeri cemeteries extant in Armenia. Nakhchivan’s isolation made it perfect for total evisceration of Armenian cultural heritage.
@AzeriTimes Would that everything still stood in both places, of course
@AzeriTimes Except there are still many cemeteries &amp; buildings left in Karabakh &amp; your government’s report does not distinguish between deliberate destruction &amp; damage incurred during the war. There was no war in Nakhchivan, but there is total obliteration of Armenian heritage

@emil_sanamyan @NikolPashinyan That’s why the “if” is there. People are often arrested pending a trial, and he still could be released on jail. But Putin is trying to interfere in the Armenian justice system by linking his arrest to the gas price, so it needs to be known to the wider audience
Putin is pissed at #Armenia because he bet that Robert Kocharyan would lead an opposition, &amp; has discovered that only those with friends &amp; family discount care if RK is jailed for his 2008 offenses.

@AdamSeymur @ProfBShaffer @Georgetown “His native language was   #Azerbaijani #Turkish” is a false statement. He also was not ethnically Azeri, he attests to his parentage himself. I understand your pride for him, because he was a great poet, from a city now in your country &amp; an inspiration to your culture.
@AdamSeymur @ProfBShaffer’s statement that he wrote in Azerbaijani Turk is demonstrably false, since the texts are extant and in Persian. Her propaganda is cheap &amp; embarrassing for @Georgetown

@emil_sanamyan @atanessi @DrKevorkO @EurasiaNet @unzippedblog Sweet https://t.co/Y94UcfduZt
@emil_sanamyan @DrKevorkO @EurasiaNet @unzippedblog This is Pigh. He’s caused a great deal of harm over the years, as I hope you know. Many can attest &amp; document that. Surely there are less offensive people to randomly quote.
@atanessi @unzippedblog @DrKevorkO @EurasiaNet Looking at FB, I see similar discussion and points being made about your article, so carry on there.
On Twitter since March and nearly no one noticed till @Kornelij did today... https://t.co/l8uOKTiUTi
@DrKevorkO Most everyone knows that Nikol's biggest fault is a hot temper that he doesn't control well, so some deliberately bait him. I hope after December things simmer down, but there are a lot of egos out there that won't be represented in Parliament.
@DrKevorkO I agree with your position. I hope Bright Armenia does well enough to take a solid 2nd place (Tsarukyan has the support to get in). The proposed legislative changes would have added more diversity but HHK made sure they didn't go through. Too much power is dangerous for anyone.
@emil_sanamyan @atanessi @DrKevorkO @EurasiaNet @unzippedblog The guy who set up Serzh's blog &amp; disseminated a false narrative in 2008 is more than a concerned citizen, and a well-known homophobe &amp; misogynist is not a pundit. One can quote but characterize more accurately. For the latter, say "conservative-value blogger" or some such.
@DrKevorkO @atanessi As I said, no problem with the topic but with @Eurasianet whitewashing these nasty bullies https://t.co/vm6RKiIeGK Since I’m told my opinion doesn’t count, you can ask @unzippedblog privately about all the harm they’ve caused.

@DocG1234 @Globalcitizn1 I don't think so
Only want Heydar, only care about originals https://t.co/7MMCnmuivZ
@ananunanasun @atanessi The other @EurasiaNet article today by another journalist, which called the infamous homophobe &amp; misogynist (and Ruben's friend) @Pigh a "pundit," was insulting &amp; beyond the pale, though.
@ananunanasun @atanessi It's fine to write about the phenomenon, though I think it's mostly mercantilist &amp; not cult (and we will see in a few months), but omitting that Ruben was Serzh's proxy &amp; propagandist and not just a "concerned citizen," puts a false perspective in the article.
