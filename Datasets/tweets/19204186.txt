1st, my professor didn't show up for our scheduled meeting to help me prep for our final.
It's only 9:30 AM &amp; today already sucks.
My life is an endless of cycle of eating too much pizza , hating myself, and then eating more pizza.
Why am I so hurt/frustrated/upset/offended/aggravated by every single little thing today?
I was stressed and pissed so I placed ColourPop and Ulta orders... I'm still stressed and pissed, but at least I'll be pretty. 👸🏻

@macadelic_19 Apparently I got into one of Nana and Poppy's bags and just started playing in it.
@macadelic_19 I'm guessing you mean the weed. It happened when I was little and Jamie was babysitting me. She told me last time I saw her.
@macadelic_19 Me being covered in weed or the conversation with my co-workers?
Told my co-workers a story about me being accidentally covered in weed  at age three. I'M REALLY GREAT AT SMALL TALK.

It's so awkward when @MACADELIC_19's biddies start following me.
As much as I hate BitStrips, I have to admit that @SportsKitten's posts have been keeping me entertained throughout the day.

Whenever I look at my work schedule for next week, I feel the urge to crawl into bed and sob uncontrollably.
One should never be on WebMD at 4 in the morning.

You want to make drunk Megan really happy? Play "Ignition" by R. Kelly at a party. I dare you.
I romanticize the idea of having bright blue nails because of Alaska Young. Thanks a lot, John Green.
It's a little pathetic how much the quality of my day depends on whether or not the Ballentine café has spinach bagels.
@gglobalwarming It's true. Nobody pointed at my feet and said, "Chick's not wearing any shoes..."

I'm just saying, would it really be that big of a deal to say Oliver instead of Stewart until September? Since, you know, it's the truth.
Don't get me wrong. I've been loving John Oliver as his temporary replacement.

I SMELL LIKE SO MUCH CITRUS!
Instead of eating an entire bag of sour cream and onion chips in one day, I did it in two. I think I'm learning self-control.
I have the teeth and fingernails of a preschooler, but the feet of a 96 year old woman.

The number of people I consider acquaintances that have openly cried in front of me within the past couple of weeks is unacceptable.

@Der_Berger93 Bahaha, there was no damage done, but I'm fairly certain 'errbody knew what I was up to after that tweet.
With that being said, I could not handle being @Der_Berger93.

@MACADELIC_19 is growing weird stuff out of his eyes. @Easy_MAC021 is bruising his face up. BABY BROTHERS! Please stop with the nonsense!
Waking up for this 10 am shift is honestly the hardest thing I've had to do so far this summer.
Not being 21 is seriously a huge hindrance on my social life. "Sorry guys, we can't go there. I am simply a child." 😒
Now I get heartburn whenever I eat pizza. What kind of fresh hell is this?
Welp, it's all balls to the wall now. Time to welcome our first batch of new students to Union Street!
Whenever I get gloomy with the state of the world, I remember that the "P-P-P-Paul Ryan" music video exists and then I feel better.

"Bananas, like people, sometimes look different when they are naked." How did I get through the day before @gracehelbig came into my life?
So that's obviously what I'm doing this morning. All I can say right now is thank God for coffee.
Walking all the way to Rawles for 2 hours of customer service training sounds like the most ridiculous way I could spend my morning.
Woke up to find half of my mattress hanging off my bed frame. What?
My shampoo and conditioner don't match. Bothersome doesn't even begin to describe this situation.
Okay, walking across the hall to use another apartment's bathroom is getting really old, really fast.
What did I learn from my first day of USC HA training? Always smile, sparkle, and shine. Oh, and don't trust Romaze. #myjobisweird.

I'd rather cut off my entire hand than deal with this mosquito bite on my ring finger for another second!
What is it about the summer that makes boys want to strike up flirty conversations with me?
I hate when I forget that I put food in the microwave. #coldbeefaroni
Whenever I have to say "laboratory," I say it like Dexter.

I had a fantastic day at @JessieLynnK's grad party!! :)
Such a busy day! And this week is only going to get busier!
I love that the bulk of the people on my grad party's "Not Attending" list are people that I'm not friends with and have never met before.
@KingBeastmode10 keeps me laughing. :)
Everything feels real now. High school was a blast, but now I'm excited for what the future has in store for me! #graduated
I love going through all of my past Facebook profile pictures. My hair has changed so much throughout the years!

@JessieLynnK Hmm, I did nap this evening. I blamed the storms, but I know the truth now. #Merlin
I wish I could just walk on to "America's Next Top Model" & have Tyra Banks tell me what haircut to get. It would make life easier.
@FutureDoc2015 Bahaha, I don't think I can pull that off. I'm thinking more like slightly above my shoulders.
Researching different hair styles! Can't wait to cut off all this hair! :) :)
Finished all my homework, but stepped on my glasses. #great

I should not have to wear my snuggie in the middle of May...
@JessieLynnK BTW, I just bought gravy... #nolie
@JessieLynnK I was too busy laughing at the FACT that you misspelled gravy to correct you earlier. And you are the foolish one.
@JessieLynnK You also should've said "that" instead of "this" when you were correcting my tweet, so suck it.

My mother gave me the option of skipping school on senior skip day or skipping school this Friday to watch the royal wedding. #toughchoice
@tabithareneee Ew. I guess I just don't see it. I think my own attraction to Duckie Dale is getting in the way. :)
@tabithareneee Why would they change that? I have watched that movie like 4789006 times, and it still doesn't make sense to me.
I really don't understand how even in the end, Andie picks Blane over Duckie. If I was her, I would be all over The Duck Man. #prettyinpink
I need to stop thinking about what should of been. Or what I could of done. Or about a million other things. I want to move on with my life.
@JessieLynnK Oh, believe me, no matter what, I am going to have a great time at prom while looking fantastic. And you are lame. :) :)
I think I'm going to have to give up on the pipe dream that was to have a prom date.

@JessieLynnK What?! Somebody just needs to learn a little self-control. Grow up.
@SportsKitten I know, right? I may be being a little unrealistic, but it was so sweet!
Now that's how every guy should ask a girl to prom. http://t.co/7QToEdC

@serriadarling I know, right? The whole thing is just disappointing.

After the ball of stress yesterday, I'm doing absolutely nothing today.
Survived the Laureate Project of 2011.
Everybody had a 4 day weekend. I've had a 6 day weekend. #getonmylevel
Woke up this morning with a fever and the feeling that my stomach is going to explode. This is really the LAST thing I needed this week.
I feel like my reflective/reflexives just keep getting shorter and shorter.
Headache. Stressed out beyond belief. Can't wait for this week to be over.
Chris Colfer, Jim Parsons, and #thesocialnetwork are trending. This makes me smile, :)
Time for the #goldenglobes! I love awards shows, :)
