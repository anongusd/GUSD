Michael Cohen is not a good guy. I’m glad he’s going to prison. While watching his testimony tomorrow, however, we’d do well to remember that the lies for which Cohen is going to jail are lies he told to protect Trump. He has not lied even once since he switched sides.
If Matt Gaetz had a lawyer, that lawyer would try to convince him not to show up to tomorrow’s Cohen hearing. Questions he asks &amp; statments he makes tomorrow can be evidence of the intent behind his tweet today. Evidence prosecutors could use to convict him of #WitnessTampering.
Matt Gaetz wouldn’t do well in the type of prison where they usually send people who are convicted of #WitnessTampering. This isn’t a keg party at FSU or the drunk tank after your 2008 DUI arrest, kid. This is serious business, and your peach fuzz babyface is not ready for it.

@TexasMudlogger That has nothing to do with whether the alleged assault/harassment was her fault. I get it - you don’t like her. Sometimes people we don’t like are victims of crimes. You can believe her without liking her or without blaming her.
One health care issue I’ve not heard a candidate speak well about is US pioneers nearly every life-saving medical procedure &amp; that’s in part b/c of our super high spending. It creates a free-rider problem that lets other wealthy western nations spend less, much like on defense.
Further, if Johnson’s account is accurate, she did nothing to invite Trump’s advances or make him reasonably think he was welcome to kiss her.
@TexasMudlogger Guilty isn’t a term applicable to her. Parents have a responsibility not to put their kids at risk. People don’t have a similar responsibility- or any responsibility - not to put themselves at risk.
I hope Jon Stewart runs for office someday.
@TexasMudlogger Aside: you aren’t using the term “pedophile” quite right. Pedophilia is a medical condition unrelated to a person’s past conduct or lack thereof. You mean someone credibly accused of abusing children.
@TexasMudlogger No. You are culpable for entirely separate and distinct conduct of putting your children at risk, but the person who abuses your children is 100 percent culpable for abusing your children.
@TexasMudlogger No woman is ever asking to be sexually assaulted or harassed, full stop.
A significant portion of Donald Trump’s base has no problem with him committing sexual assault but hates the idea of him trying to kiss a black woman.
Alva Johnson should be taken seriously and treated with respect. Donald Trump has committed sex crimes against 19 women that we know about. The accuser is credible &amp; the accused is the biggest liar in the history of American public office.
If Donald Trump doesn’t publicly push for this, he never gets to complain about how we need to take care of our veterans again. These women &amp; men were hurt by a vicious act of war. They deserve medical care - on us - for the rest of our days, no questions asked. https://t.co/40g0Jy7HKL

@BobSalera My effective federal tax rate went from 19% to 23%. I compared refunds year-over-year because I just finished my 2018 taxes today and had that info in front of me.
@BobSalera And even though I did change jobs, my income didn’t go up a ton since I only worked my new job for five months and took six weeks off between jobs. It’s a pretty apples-to-apples comparison. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act cost me quite a bit of money in Year 1.
@BobSalera No, it is meaningful b/c I didn’t move until second half of year, so I filed as a DC resident again for 2018. I also had a ton of job-seeking and moving expenses that would’ve been deductible pre-2018, but aren’t anymore. If not for the new law, my refund would’ve gone way up.
@BobSalera Do you mean to what specific provisions in the Tax Cuts &amp; Jobs Act is my small refund attributable? The biggest one is the cap on deductibility of state and local taxes paid, but I can give you a more fulsome list of the provisions that hit me if you’re interested.
I was firmly against the bill when I thought it might benefit me personally because, as a Democrat, I’m a member of the only party that cares about debt.

To clarify, Sen. Gillibrand means she’d let students refi their federal student debt at 4%. The President can’t make private lenders allow students to refi. It’s a good, but pretty small, idea.

@SallyCat100 @TheRickWilson I cannot think of any crime like the kind you are mentioning that Stone seems likely to have committed based on this.
@TheRickWilson Any money Stone raised off of that photo constitutes proceeds of a crime and thus should be seized as part of his upcoming prosecution for threatening a federal judge.
On President’s Day, maybe the President should take some time out from criticizing the FBI and black athletes with opinions on public policy to criticize someone who threatens federal judges, which, by the way, is a federal crime.

3. Withhold FDIC insurance from lenders that charge students over, say, 4% int. 4. Expand public service loan forgiveness; 5.	Allow student debt to be discharged in bankruptcy; and 6. Institute need &amp; time-based forgiveness for people who earn &lt; $100k after 15 years of payments.
Fed govt cannot and should not forgive every dollar of student loan debt, but there is lots of it should do: 1. Massively expand Stafford loan program and make it interest-free. 2. Set maximum tuition rates &amp; year-over-year increases for all universities that receive fed funding.
Klobuchar could’ve given a better answer as to what she’d do about the student loan crisis. It’s a $1.5 trillion problem, and “making it easier to refinance” is both something government can’t promise when it comes to private loans &amp; not nearly enough. #KlobucharTownHall

For example, AIPAC spent millions lobbying against the Iran deal. If you have internationalist foreign policy views like, for instance, Barack Obama, John Kerry, Angela Merkel or David Cameron (or me), you probably opposed AIPAC staunchly without being the least bit anti-Semitic.
AIPAC’s political donations are legal &amp; its policy ideas are within the mainstream. But they are right-wing ideas, and disagreeing with them &amp; fighting for contradictory policy is just as legitimate. As an American w Jewish grandparents &amp; liberal views, I’m with Omar, not AIPAC.

It’s time for the GOP to learn to tell the difference between a liberal and an anti-Semite and for Democrats to stop apologizing for criticizing Israel when Israel behaves in a way that merits criticism.
Isaac Herzog articulated an inclusive center-left vision during his campaign for Israeli PM. The views he shares with mainstream Democrats represent the only fair &amp; responsible way forward. AIPAC’s partisan hackery supports Netanyahu’s worst instincts &amp; makes world less safe.
GOP has lied, misconstrued &amp; demagogued every center-left criticism of Israel for decades &amp;  Dems need to stop cowering. Having a liberal vision of the future that includes sovereign &amp; peaceful Israeli &amp; Palestinian states is not anti-Semitic. It’s the only reasonable position.
As a pro-Israel liberal, I think some of Ilhan Omar’s past comments on Israelil have gone too far, but I have no problem with comments she made today. AIPAC is a right-wing organization that undermines regional peace &amp; US-Israeli relationship. Saying so isn’t at all anti-Semitic.
Don’t forget that, in 2012, Cheney said President Obama had delegitimized Israel. In her view, practically anyone who supports a two-State solution or holds a Labor party view of Israel’s future is an anti-Semite. The US-Israel relationship is too important for partisan hackery.
You can support @AIPAC,	as Cheney does, or disagree with it, as Omar does, without being a bit anti-Semitic. To equate progressive pro-Israel views with anti-Semitism, as Cheney does, is offensive &amp; dangerous. It ends an important conversation before it has a chance to start.
As someone whose Jewish grandparents lost everything when they fled the Nazis &amp; who lost a great-uncle in a concentration camp, I am offended by @Liz_Cheney’s flagrant misuse of the term anti-semitism. @AIPAC is a right-wing organization &amp; @IlhanMN’s criticism of it is accurate. https://t.co/0MhKxR9iP5

After he lost in 2010, Tom was asked if he regretted that vote. He said: "there are worse things than being a former member of Congress." He understood that, among those worse things is watching millions of Americans suffer without insurance &amp; choosing to do nothing to help them.
In April 2017, I traveled 2 hours to see @tomperriello speak at George Mason.

@BKast21 Medicare would have to be way more costly than current Medicare. About 6.5x more. But Medicare would become 100% of all US health care spending - no more $100 out of your paycheck, no more copays, no more direct payment/debt for the uninsured - which is why we’d save as a whole.

@SHINEONMYMOTHER I understand that it was common, but I also don’t care. There were plenty of people who stood up against that sort of thing or at least refused to be a part of it, and the people who are good enough to be our leaders come exclusively from those categories.
I have a one-strike policy when it comes to posing as or with a Klansman and wanting to remain in elected office. Do it once and you can GTFO.
@SHINEONMYMOTHER I’m comparing their denials of disqualifying conduct because I think they’re comparable. Northam &amp; Trump aren’t comparable leaders or people. Northam has been a good Governor &amp; I don’t think he presently holds racist views. Trump currenty is a racist, xenophobic abomination.
Ralph Northam saying it wasn’t him in yearbook photo a day after admitting it sounds like Donald Trump saying it wasn’t him on Access Hollywood tape after admitting it. I don’t believe in purity tests, but I do believe in decency tests, which is why both Northam &amp; Trump must go.
There is no way to square recent former Republican Ralph Northam’s denial today that he was in the yearbook photo with his contrary admission yesterday. I believe his denial today is a lie, and if he doesn’t resign, he should be removed from office.
It’s possible for 2 things to be true at once: 1. Ralph Northam in 1984 did an unspeakably racist thing; and 2. Ralph Northam in 2019 has much more inclusive views on race issues than the highly racist opposition, but still needs to resign bc of the terrible thing he did in 1984.
Democrats calling for Ralph Northam to resign are outraged at his disgusting and unforgivable  behavior. Republicans calling for him to resign are gleeful that a Democrat has a race problem. They aren’t the slightest bit outraged by the Klan robe. We are better than they are.

I hope that, when Ralph Northam resigns, incoming Governor Justin Fairfax will ask Tom Periello to be lieutenant governor.
I believe that Ralph Northam has become a good person who has progressive views on racial issues now. But posing for that picture in 1984 means he was too wrong too recently. He needs to resign.
When Ralph Northam was asked during the primary why he was a Republican until 2008 and voted for George W. Bush twice, he said that he didn’t think about things very much back then.
Ralph Northam posing as or with a Klansman more than two decades after they lynched Medgar Evers and hundreds of other young black men is disgusting and unforgivable. I am disgusted, and I do not forgive him.
I cannot imagine an acceptable explanation for that photo of Ralph Northam, and I cannot imagine any appropriate response from the Governor that does not involve his prompt resignation.
@brianschatz @BetoORourke. He has an inclusive progressive vision, political courage, and an ability to cut through the bullshit &amp; fight on his terms. He also has all of the soft skills - charisma and the ability to inspire- that are needed by successful candidates and presidents.

I don’t think we should increase the amount of money we are spending on border security. We should cut it significantly. Our border is incredibly secure. We are wasting money that could be better spent on health care, public education, or reducing the deficit.

@SHINEONMYMOTHER You mean quash? No. Only the subject of a subpoena can file a motion to quash. But Whitaker does have the ability to approve or deny most of Mueller’s major decisions, and I think he could refuse to allow Mueller to subpoena the President.	I’m not certain of that, however.
No matter what Matt Whitaker says, the chances of Robert Mueller ending his investigation without subpoenaing the President are near zero.

Howard Schultz is a Democrat. His position on every issue is that of a moderate Dem, socially liberal &amp; fiscally centrist. If he wants to run, he should do so as a Dem. If he can’t convince centermost 40% of Democratic Party to vote for him, he has no chance to become President.
It is wildly inappropriate for Matt Whitaker to make a statement about how much longer the Mueller investigation will last. The Mueller investigation will end when Robert Mueller decides it will end, and not one minute before.

I’d like a grande, no-whip Howard Schultz go take your candidacy and shove it up your ass, please. To go.

@Brian_Egan That’s about as good of a source as there is. I think the figures I found are total indictments, not number of people indicted. I agree people indicted is probably a more meaningful stat. It has high VORS (value over replacement statistic).
@Brian_Egan I LOVE it! But where did you get the figure of 37 for Trump? The sources I’ve looked at (not just twitter) all say 90.
@Brian_Egan I realized after hitting enter that saying “IARP President” is redundant ala “ATM machine.” There’s no excuse for poor syntax, even when discussing made-up statistics.
@Brian_Egan He’s a very high IARP President, Brian, very high. From Nixon to present, the average is just under 3 indictments/year. So Trump has an IARP of more than +42/year. He has a little over 3x as many as Nixon. He’s the indisputable GOAT in indictments/year.
During pre-trial discovery, Robert Mueller will obtain every email, text message, and record of meeting and phone call between Roger Stone and Individual 1 from the time Stone first started talking to Wikileaks through the present.
That’s 45 indictments/year for Trump and 0 indictments/year for Obama. Trump is winning by a margin of 45 indictments/year. I’m not sick of all the winning yet, but I bet the President and his family are scared that the winning might continue. https://t.co/lYRuK7XsLg

@BKast21 I have mixed feelings abt what should happen here. It’s Syria in 2011 - one answer feels right (intervening in Syria &amp; fixing call here), but all options have bad side effects. But it’s absurd NFL hasn’t included penalties in review process. I hope they fix it before next season.
For something this glaring in this big of a game, it seems crazy to let it stand. The best solution is to make penalty calls/no-calls reviewable in-game, subject to the same clear evidence standard for overturning as all other calls. https://t.co/Tu2wZvxN8l
If, as Sean Payton says, NFL has admitted refs blew PI no-call, league should fix it by having the teams start from that point of the game with call changed. Saints ball, 1st &amp; 10, spot of foul, this Sunday. It’s crazy to knowingly allow a SB berth to be decided by a bad mistake.
How these poignant words of Dr. King’s could possibly have motivated @ScottWalker to make the choices he has made as a public servant are beyond comprehension. https://t.co/kTqMUvvlJl

@BKast21 I believe he gave it to Putin expecting to get it back at some point and Putin never gave it back. He also gave a ring to Trump after the Pats-Falcons Super Bowl.
A reminder that Patriots owner Robert Kraft gave a Super Bowl ring to his friend Vladimir Putin. As if decent people everywhere needed any more reason to root for the Rams, who have never spied on other teams' practices, inflated balls, or been friendly with murderous dictators.
I strongly dislike Belichick, but I have to grudgingly admit that this is maybe the most impressive coaching job of his career. The Patriots are not among the three best teams in the AFC, maybe not among the best five. Really damn impressive.
This is the worst Patriots team to go to the Super Bowl since the last time they played the Rams.

@BKast21 He prefers to be referred to as A Lot of Softball Player because that's the amount of softball player he is.
I'm about as big of a Patriots hater as there is, but that delay of game feels really unfair when the refs held the snap until the play clock was down to about 4.
Are the Chiefs playing any linebackers at all?
Chiefs need to get a screen game going to slow Pats pass rush.
What a game-swinger!
James White is taking a page out of Leveon Bell’s playbook.
Tulsi Gabbard both-sides-ing the government shutdown makes it clear she’s not on our side. She will end up not endorsing the 2020 Democratic nominee. The candidate who rips her to shreds in the first debate will skyrocket into the first tier.
The Saints were robbed of that game with an egregious no-call on 23 of the Rams, but they also hurt themselves by not being able to score a TD on their second possession starting deep in Rams’ territory after the Davis INT. They left the door open.
If there is any justice, this game will end with Zuerlein missing a chip shot.
That’s the worst no-call I’ve seen in a big game since Jimmy Smith on 4th and goal in the Ravens-49ers Super Bowl. It was an absolute body check a full beat before the ball arrived.
Again. https://t.co/UTTiW0todh
Sean Payton had the guts to let Brees take a deep shot from midfield with 2 min left in a tied NFC title game, but Sean McVay couldn’t find it in himself to go for it on 4th and goal from inside the 1 with more than 5 min left and two timeouts. #outcoached
Kicking that field goal may be where the Rams lost this game.
Sean McVay is letting the magnitude of the game get to him. 4th and goal from inside the 1 in this spot is a clear go-for-it situation. The math isn’t close.
I want to see Brees take a deep shot on first down here.
What exactly does 23 on the Rams have to do to get called for pass interference?
Joe Buck should not tell jokes because Joe Buck is not funny.
Where’s Todd Gurley?
I don't know what it means to "dog walk" someone, but it doesn't sound like it'd be fun for the someone getting dog walked.
I'm beginning to suspect that Gurley is still semi-seriously hurt and the Rams have done a pretty great job of hiding it for three weeks.
Way more three and outs in this Saints-Rams first half than I was expecting.
I love that fake punt by the Rams. Fortune favors the bold.
I don't get the Saints' use of Taysom Hill in key spots. You have maybe the best QB of all-time who is playing his A game. It is crazy to take him off of the field on third down in the red zone.

Dems already have a center-right position on border security. $1.3 billion (their proposal) is way too much funding. We do not have a border crossing problem &amp; are wasting money that could be used to fund health care or reduce deficit. DHS's budget should be cut at least in half.
RT @nancymquinonez: I’m working without pay at the IRS #DidTrumpOpenGovernmentyet
If Trump were to offer six years and two days of protection for DACA kids - until it is mathematically certain that he'll be out of office - it might be worthwhile for Dems to consider giving a few additional bucks of border security funding, but not for a day less than that.
Nancy Pelosi will not negotiate with anyone who holds a gun to her head. Reopen the government, and then she will seriously consider any compromise proposal you have, Donald.
The Trump administration has illegally deported and killed DACA kids. Why on earth would Democrats agree to build a wall of xenophobia in exchange for a fig leaf temporary extension of legal protections the Trump administration has already shown it does not respect?
President Trump is going on TV right now because he knows he is losing and he is scared. Nancy Pelosi (metaphorically) has her foot on this throat. It'd be insane to do anything other than wait until he taps out.

@MarkAlexMclenna I dunno- that’s hard for me to imagine. I doubt Buzzfeed would have been so declarative in the story unless the sources told BF’s reporter they had it cold.

Every elected Republican who takes press questions should be asked whether they think Steve King should resign for defending white supremacism and if not, why not,	until they have answered both questions unequivocally.
@BKast21 Just to put some stats behind my Pats’ dislike: Chargers were 12-4 vs league’s 3rd-toughest schedule, while Pats were 11-5	vs league’s 5th-easiest schedule. Empirically, it seems pretty clear Chargers were a better team, even though you don’t get AFC title game berths for math.

I don’t know that they’ll win, but I guarantee you Andrew Luck and the Colts aren’t scared of the Chiefs, the snow, or their wunkerkind QB. They’re going to come out and play these guys tough.
Elizabeth Warren announcing early was a great strategic move. I’m surprised other legit contenders have let her have the stage to herself for this long. The other top-tier contenders (other than Biden) are taking a big risk if they don’t announce soon.

@JuanitaIguana1 It’s great when college kids are activists, but it’s also okay when they’re not. I don’t think the Clemson Tigers’ players have a civic responsibility not to go. I do think the coaches have such a responsibility (but I can’t imagine Dabo Sweeney living up to that responsibility).
I will respect &amp; admire any Clemson player who refuses to attend, or who says publicly that he’ll attend if the president reopens the government first. I won’t think ill of players who don’t because it’s not fair to expect college kids to be activists. https://t.co/nB83ij0Jgm

Lamar Miller is a video game. Maybe the Texans shouldn’t have played Alfred Blue so much in the first half?
Even though it didn't work, I love the defensive look from the Colts on 4th and 3 there: try to bait Watson by showing him man coverage on Hopkins and then taking it away at the snap.
@minakimes Is the sport the Texans’ O-line is playing curling?
Deshaun Watson doesn't look bad, but he doesn't look good, either.
If the Texans hold the Colts to a field goal here and make a game out of this, it will be because of that amazing self-sacrificing hit by Reid on a guy twice his size.
I don't know what odds you can get for a Colts-Chargers AFC Championship game, but I bet they are juicy.
It's important that Dems don't give Donald Trump a fig leaf. No $5 billion for non-wall border security that Trump can pretend is a win. It's vital to the go-forward health of our democracy that Democrats break him decisively and publicly &amp; bring his presidency to its knees.

@BKast21 @AOC Raising taxes on people this rich won’t cut the deficit or do much to solve our broader economic and tax fairness problems, but AOC isn’t claiming it will. She’s trying to solve a problem that is entirely different from the one with which you’re concerned. 4/x
@BKast21 @AOC Unlike closing loopholes, raising taxes on the super-wealthy is politically popular in addition to (in my view) being ethically and economically sound, which (in my view) makes it a good proposal to raise cash to address the world’s most urgent &amp; consequential problem. 3/x
@BKast21 @AOC AOC, in contrast, is trying to raise money to invest in solutions to climate change. A big rate increase on income over $10m would only affect a few thousand Americans, and even they would get to have the first $10m of their income each year taxed at the current low rates. 2/x
@BKast21 @AOC You and AOC are trying to solve entirely different problems, both of which are worth solving. You are trying to fix the deficit, a problem to which I agree closing loopholes is a part of the optimal solution, but is politically very difficult. 1/x
The problem isn’t that a Congresswoman called the president a motherfucker. The problem is that the president is a motherfucker.
The key here is @AOC is only advocating a 60-70% rate for income over $10 million. Climate change is going to kill us all. Asking people who earn more than $10 million per year to pay more to help save 7.5 billion lives strikes me as pretty reasonable. https://t.co/U0vojd0M8y

You can't imagine how much I don't give a shit about George Papadopoulos and his post-prison career plans.
DHS arrested a 7-year-old girl, then didn't give her enough water to keep her alive. Every single CBP agent who was on duty &amp; failed to give Jakelin Caal water is guilty of voluntary manslaughter &amp; should receive the maximum sentence of 10 yrs under federal sentencing guidelines.
5th Circuit prob wont hear appeal of today's absurd Obamacare ruling fast enough for SCOTUS to take case in 2018-19 term. Thatd mean in spring &amp; summer 2020 - start of gen election - voters will get daily reminders GOP tries to take away our health care whenever theyre in charge.
Before you freak out about Judge Reed O'Connor's baseless ruling invalidating Obamacare's individual mandate b/c I Like Beer has replaced Kennedy on SCOTUS, remember that Kennedy voted to strike down Affordable Care Act in 2012 &amp; Roberts saved it. Obamacare isn't going anywhere.
@BetoORourke used the single most important term for us to keep in mind when thinking about refugees who try to cross our border: human beings. He used it over &amp; over in a way that makes it easy to imagine him ripping @realDonaldTrump to shreds on this issue in 2020. https://t.co/0ufVGXldNf

I’m perfectly happy with the strategy and position Dems have taken on the shutdown fight, and am thrilled with Nancy Pelosi’s leadership. But I hope she &amp; Schumer aren’t the ones who go on TV to articulate the Dem message during any actual shutdown.
@kasie She was more or less saying “you’re gonna need congressional approval and you don’t have the votes.”
@EndDeportations No. No. A thousand times no. Pence would be awful - one of the few worst presidents in history - but he would be awful within the bounds of normalcy.
@Brian_Egan It's performative centrism, and its underlying premise that there is something equally wrong with both parties that only a third party or unity ticket can fix is dangerously flawed. End rant.
@Brian_Egan The idea of a unity ticket is a fantasy geriatric members of the press who want to make American politics great again by taking us back to a bygone era of bipartisanship that probably can never be reclaimed due to sociogeographicapolitical factors invent every 4 years.
@Brian_Egan buuuut I think there's basically no need for a unity ticket. The sort of agenda a unity ticket would pursue is one any mainstream Democratic administration would be on board with fully. It's the agenda Pres. Obama tried to enact for 8 years, only to be blockaded at every turn.
@Brian_Egan The Dem at top of the ticket would have to be someone not from the left fringes so potential GOP voters wouldn't feel like they were being asked to hold their noses (e.g., not Bernie or Elizabeth Warren). Back to who the best GOP VP would be, here's my answer: Lisa Murkowski.
@Brian_Egan That's not an exhaustive list obv, but those are the tent poles. A lot of potential Republican VPs wouldn't be on board with that sort of platform. Most of our most serious problems aren't ones Republicans want to solve (which is why they've festered &amp; snowballed so badly)
@Brian_Egan (4) long-term deficit reduction (not a first-order need, but it's a good idea &amp; you have to give Wall St. Journal editorial page an excuse to endorse the ticket); (5) deficit-neutral tax reform w a corporate rate in the mid-20s, a 0 indiv rate under $40k &amp; almost no deductions.
@Brian_Egan Secret extra criterion #4 is that the GOP VP has to be fully ready to embrace the unity agenda that solves the country's big problems: (1) world-leading action on climate change; (2) huge public investments in infrastructure; (3) something like Medicaid for All at minimum...
@Brian_Egan I also suspect if I knew more about Susanna Martinez, I'd like her, but she has same problem as Sandoval. Bob Corker probably meets all three criteria, but he fails secret extra criterion #4 (so unfair that this guy has secret extra criteria for a pointless thought experiment!)
@Brian_Egan My first choice - Colin Powell - fails criterion (3). I think he's a registered independent now, &amp; prob would've endorsed Hillary over a median R like Rubio (although probably not over Jeb!). I like Brian Sandoval, although he's not enough of a name to bring R voters on board.
@Brian_Egan Mitt fails criterion (2), although just barely. Kasich may have the best case for meeting all three criteria. I don't think he has gravitas; I think he has a mediocre mind and a poor command of policy issues, especially for someone with such a long resume.
@Brian_Egan But if there were to be a unity ticket, the Republican would have to meet three key criteria for this to work: (1) gravitas, as you point out; (2) be totally untainted by Trump; &amp; (3) be genuinely right-of-center so the left half of the GOP can feel okay voting for the ticket.
@Brian_Egan I have lots of thoughts on this. Reasoned rant to follow. My first thought is that, if you're not ready to just vote for a Democrat after the last two years, you're not part of the solution and we can fix the place without you.
Of course Trump wants a shutdown fight over a wall. He is terrified that he will be impeached and indicted and that Senate Republicans will turn on him. He is desperate for a partisan fight that will rally, say, John Thune to his side.
@mattyglesias made an important point on today’s episode of The Weeds: millions of Americans spent years unemployed needlessly because Paul Ryan and the business community pretended they thought there was a debt &amp; deficit crisis and the media bit hard on their fake.
This is a bullshit centrist fantasy and a complete misrepresentation of who Mitt “no one’s ever asked to see my birth certificate” Romney is. A unity ticket is not an uninteresting concept- so long as a Dem is at the top - but Mitt Romney is the wrong guy. https://t.co/JUqyF9qI4i

It’s been a bad day for #Indivdual1 and a good day for Individuals 2 through 325,000,000.
You know what this means, right? We’re gonna get to see the pee tape!
If a sitting president or a sitting #Indivdual1 can’t be indicted, at very least, DOJ should be able to formally recommend to the Cabinet that they temporarily remove him via 25th Amendment long enough to stand trial with the understanding that he’ll be reinstated if acquitted.

@BubblegumGram @SHINEONMYMOTHER He could be indicted after he leaves office, but I’d put the odds at roughly 95% the next Democratic President will instruct DOJ not to prosecute so s/he can seem magnanimous &amp; try to unify the country. I think he almost certainly will escape criminal punishment for his crimes.
@BubblegumGram @SHINEONMYMOTHER There may well be no consequences. It may be up to us, the voters, to impose upon him the only consequence we can: throwing him out if our White House on Nov. 3,	2020.
#Individual1 is the perfect moniker for President Trump. It’s exactly the number of individuals about whom he cares.

@LorenCosby His only avenue is to sue the US Dept of Justice. Mueller is a DOJ appointee and everything he does in his investigation is in his capacity as such. What you suggested Flynn might do wasn't just off by a word or two.		I'm shocked that a journalist doesn't understand these basics.
@LorenCosby Flynn's atty is not a prosecutor. S/he is a defense atty &amp; can't file charges, either. Prosecutors don't defend defendants (like Flynn); they prosecute defendants.		Do you really not know differences between civil &amp; criminal court systems, and between prosecutors &amp; other lawyers?
@LorenCosby I'd think a 7x Emmy winning journalist would know only a prosecutor can file charges against someone, and Flynn is not a prosecutor &amp; thus can't file charges. Would you like to retract your take?		Congrats on your 2002 Emmy for outstanding morning/noon newscast in markets 51-100.
My guess is Mueller's next move after Flynn sentencing will be to issue subpoenas to Pres. Trump for both testimony &amp; production of documents (a subpoena duces tecum for my fellow nerds) b/c he now has everything else he needs to indict whomever he thinks deserves to be indicted.
Hard to imagine Mueller writing Flynn such a glowing letter of recommendation to get into Not-Prison University unless Flynn gave him something big on somebody big. At very least, my guess is Flynn provided dead-bang proof that Trump lied in written answers to Mueller's questions

@livingstondj @lynnv378 I’ve no issue w tone of your tweet, &amp; I may have misread the story. I thought the troops Pres Trump sent to border used tear gas, not CBP, which i know is under DHS, not DOD). If so, that would better coincide with my opinion of Sec Mattis, who I think has done a good job.
I agree 100%, Senator. How do you think Justice Kavanaugh will rule on climate change issues? Which side do you think he would’ve been on in Massachusetts v EPA?

@BKast21 @MLB I suspect labor-mgmt law issues are part of it, but you’d think either @MLB would have a blanket policy of not donating to candidates, or that it’d support the non-segregationist over the segregationist either bc its right thing to do or bc there are a few black baseball players.
@brianschatz I wish that weren’t so.

Btw, this would not have been true had Khashoggi been murdered while Bush43 was in office, as lousy of a potus as he was.

Donald Trump just said that what @barackobama “did to our military made us very unsafe.” I respectfully submit that what President Obama did with our military made Osama bin Laden very unsafe.
Donald Trump will not win a war of words with Michelle Obama. She’s right, and she is a better person than he is in every way. He won’t even succeed in dragging him into a war of words. He is nowhere near on her level.
The forecast in San Francisco this morning says 58 amd “smoke.” And it smells like a distant campfire outside.
I don’t know if Rick Scott won or lost the election on Tuesday, but I know for sure he is lying to try to stop the votes from being counted. Not surprising from a guy who committed Medicare fraud &amp; was fined over $1b. It won’t work. Count the damn votes.

I’m not at all inclined to think a recount will change an election result in the vast majority of cases, but this is some shady shit. Count the votes. All the votes. The person with the most wins. The risk of losing an election is a small price to pay for democracy. https://t.co/5NhtIwryEJ
I read today that Antonio Brown was stopped by police for driving 100 mph. I think he went even faster through the Panthers secondary tonight.
Trump beat Clinton by 9.2% in Texas. Beto lost to Cruz by 2.6%. If Beto picked up 6.6% on the Clinton vote in every state, he'd pick up PA, WI, MI, FL, AZ, NC, and GA. That's 345 electoral votes. In other words, a landslide, and not the kind caused by climate change. #Beto2020

Robert Mueller has been ready for this possibility for months. He has a plan for how to deal with this situation. He’s a hockey player. He knows how to throw an elbow when he needs to.

If @SenatorCollins really wanted Mueller to be able to continue his investigation unfettered, here’s what she’d say: “I will not vote to take any action, not even to rename a motherfucking post office, until Pres. Trump signs a bill making it impossible for him to fire Mueller.” https://t.co/S29oeNCQ6W
There’s a twisted irony to the fact that Jeff Sessions got fired for doing the one honorable, decent thing he did in his tenure as Attorney General.
Firing Jeff Sessions under these circumstances looks like a high-risk, high-reward move to an outsider. But if Trump knows he committed crimes &amp; Mueller has him nailed, there’s no risk. It’s just high-reward. This is strong evidence of mens rea element of obstruction of justice.
One of first votes Mitt Romney will cast as a Senator will be on Trump’s nominee to replace Jeff Sessions. He had opportunity to be a leader &amp; a hero by saying publicly - now - that he will not vote for any AG nominee until Trump signs a bill making Mueller termination-proof.
If Democrats has won the Senate last night, or even kept it at 51-49, Trump would not have had the leverage or confidence to force Jeff Sessions to resign.
We got 2 things we needed last night: a check on President Trump &amp; a wake-up call heading into 2020. Anyone who thought it was going to be easy to beat Trump in 2020 should have found our losses in Florida &amp; Ohio bracing. It’s going to take a strong candidate &amp; lots of hard work.

Both parties say they’ll protect preexisting conditions. We didn’t have PEC protections for 224 years &amp; got them in 2010 in Obamacare. Who do you trust: the party of Obama, who all voted yes, or party that said it would end America as we know it, then voted to repeal it 70 times?
Before any Republican can have even an iota of credibility on any health care issue, they will have to say out loud “I was wrong about Obamacare. It turned out to be a pretty good law.”
The interesting thing about what Michael Cohen said today is GOP wants to end protections for preexisting conditions &amp; let insurance companies charge sick people so much they’ll go bankrupt before they can afford insurance. They also want to cut Medicare &amp; social security. Vote.

Republicans fundamentally don’t want you to have decent health care. It’s not bc they want you to get sick, go bankrupt, or die - they don’t. It’s bc they want to give more $ to rich people &amp; insurance companies &amp; they’re willing to risk your physical &amp; financial health to do it.

I’m not voting to try to take my country back on November 6. I’m voting to take it forward.
Unifying the country around the shared mission of loving and being decent to one another requires after terrorist attacks like this week’s requires two things: a good heart and the courage to follow it. Nearly all of our first 44 presidents had both. President Trump has neither.
If Bush-41 or Eisenhower were president when right-wing terrorists mailed bombs to prominent Democrats &amp; murdered 11 people at a synagogue, they would have gone on TV instantly &amp; said, “if you are anything but outraged at this, I am not your President &amp; I do not want your vote.”
If supposedly mainstream GOP institutions like the NRCC and the Montana GOP are opposed to politically motivated violence, why didn’t they recruit &amp; bankroll a conservative who has never bodyslammed a journalist to challenge Greg Gianforte in the primary?

A consequence of Trump encouraging fans to attack ppl he doesn’t like &amp; praising them after committing crimes &amp; also of GOP failure to stand up to him is fringe Trump followers feel empowered to attack people they don’t like. Today, my childhood home of Pittsburgh was the victim.
You know who you can trust to protect people w preexisting conditions? The people who voted for Obamacare &amp; then voted to protect it from the GOP’s 70+ onslaughts to repeal it: Sinema, Rosen, Beto, McCaskill, Donnelly, Nelson. Know who you can’t trust on this issue? Republicans.
Nearly every Republican (Scott, Hawley, McSally, Blackburn, Desantis) running in a close race for Senate or governor saying they’ll protect preexisting conditions has voted to end PEC protections or is currently (like right now) suing the federal govt to take them away from you.

I think Dem House &amp; Senate candidates shouldn’t just be going after their GOP opponents for voting to repeal Obamacare in 2017. They should go after them for voting no on ACA in 2010 &amp; bragging about their yes votes. Hang all 8 years of bad health care votes around their necks.
Martha McSally is being sneaky when she says she supports forcing insurance companies to cover preexisting conditions. She wants them to be able to charge you whatever they want to cover you. You don’t have a meaningful right to coverage if the policy costs 100x your income.
The way you know Kyrsten Sinema supports strong health insurance for everyone, incl protections for preexisting conditions, is that she’s voted to protect &amp; strengthen your health care more 50+ times. You don’t have to take her word for it; she has the voting record to prove it.
Props to Chris Wallace for asking Martha McSally directly abt her vote to repeal protections for people w preexisting conditions &amp; pointing out she’d lied about what ACA repeal bill she voted for said. Sinema wants you to have health care you can count on &amp; McSally doesn’t #AZSen

After some distance from it, I think Trump made the Robert E. Lee comments because, after the Kanye meeting, he feared his supporters wouldn't like the image of him hugging a black person, so he wanted to make it clear that he's so racist he isn't sure where he stands on slavery.

Don’t look now, but Mitch McConnell just deputized Joe McCarthy into his last-ditch plea in favor of Kavanaugh. Next stop Hitler?
When Mitch McConnell says the allegations against Kavanaugh are “completely uncorroborated,” it makes me think he must not know what the word “corroborated” means. Or the word “completely.” If nothing else, her therapist’s 2012 notes clearly corroborate Dr. Blasey’s allegations.
If just one GOP Senator announces s/he is a No, this whole thing will be over in 5 minutes, and America wins.

FBI was to be investigating, first &amp; foremost, whether Kavanaugh assaulted Christine Blasey Ford 36 years ago &amp; lies about it to Congress last week. But they didn’t ask Kavanaugh whether he did either of those things. Anyone who votes yes is admitting they just wanted cover.
The FBI did not interview Brett Kavanaugh because the White House told them not to. The White House told them not to because, if FBI had interviewed Kavanaugh, he would either have lied (which is a crime) or admitted the truth, that he assaulted Dr. Blasey &amp; lies about it to SJC.

@Brian_Egan He got game.
Tomorrow's vote on cloture for Kavanaugh is a moment for our country. I am confident that 51+ Senators believe in their hearts &amp; minds that No is the vote this moment requires. I am hopeful that each of them will summon the courage to meet the moment.
If President Trump didn't put a leash on FBI's investigation into Kavanaugh, he should ask Director Wray to hold a press conference &amp; let the press ask him whatever they want about it.
I have deep respect for Ben Sasse the person &amp; deep frustration w Ben Sasse the Senator. If he wants a new SCOTUS nominee, he can get one by voting no tomorrow. If he came out tonight against Kavanaugh, he'd get a new nominee w/in 48 hrs. 		You have a vote, Senator. Wield it.
I want badly to see @JeffFlake go on TV &amp; say, calmly &amp; politely, "If Leader McConnell wants me to even consider voting for Kavanaugh, he'll hold the vote when I tell him I'm ready for it &amp; not a moment before. If he doesn't, I'll show him where he can shove his cloture."
Trump lied when he said FBI's Kavanaugh probe would be unlimited in scope. If @JeffFlake, @SenatorCollins &amp; @lisamurkowski care about truthfulness of their President &amp; the integrity of the process, they can show it tomorrow by voting no. It's the way you stand up &amp; say "Stop."
Any Senator who whines about how little time they are given to read the FBI report but votes yes on cloture gets no points. They have the power to tell McConnell that, if he wants their vote, they'll tell him when they're ready to vote on cloture, not the other way around.
In what kind of investigation do you not interview alleged perpetrator &amp; accuser? This isn’t a real investigation &amp; I want to hear Dir Wray say so publicly &amp; Sens Flake, Collins &amp; Murkowski say this isn’t good enough for them &amp; they’ll vote no unless Trump takes the leash off.
President Trump directed FBI not to interview Kavanaugh as part of its investigation because that would’ve put Kavanaugh in the position of either lying to FBI (which is a crime) or telling the truth (which would mean he doesn’t get confirmed).
That is a truth fact. https://t.co/nrYK8plEoP
Millions &amp; millions of Americans who have a lot less money than @realDonaldTrump pay every dollar of tax we owe every year. We take patriotic pride in helping our country pay for schools &amp; health care for the poor. Trump’s tens of millions of tax evasion is criminal &amp; unpatriotic

When Mitch McConnell blames Democrats for “delaying” a vote on Kavanaugh, I suppose he means Jeff Flake, Susan Collins, and Lisa Murkowski?
I don’t think there’s any event that could possibly occur that would make Mitch McConnell cry. He’s that dead inside.

A problem w idea of believing all women is it can be exploited by professional liars like Kellyamme Conway. I dont know if she is being truthful. I do know allegations from women who are telling truth can withstand careful, respectful scrutiny, as Dr. Blasey has w flying colors.

RT @jonlovett: It’s still not over.
Dr. Blasey said she is 100% certain that Brett Kavanaugh is the one who attacked her. That means there is no space to believe Kavanaugh without believing Blasey is lying. Every GOP Senator voting yes on Kavanaugh - including Jeff Flake - should be pressed to say that out loud.
Patrick Leahy just showed all of the old, white GOP men on the Senate Judiciary Committee that they have no excuse for failing to change with the times. Leahy is 78 years old and woke AF.
I’m most disappointed in Jeff Flake’s decision to vote yes on Kavanaugh. I know he believes Dr. Blasey. He never seems to find it in himself to show up when it counts.
I don’t think we should believe all accusers. We should vet their stories carefully &amp; respectfully &amp; give accused chance to respond. I believe Christine Blasey Ford. She has no reason to lie &amp; Kavanaugh, who has lied under oath many times abt many things, has every reason to lie.
If one - just one - Republican Senator comes out tomorrow and says s/he believes Dr. Blasey &amp; won’t vote for Kavanaugh, the dominoes will come crashing down quickly and he won’t get 45 votes. Kavanaugh will withdraw by the end of next week.

If you are a Senator &amp; you are anything less than highly confident that Brett Kavanaugh is innocent (and I don’t see how you can be), you cannot consider voting yes. It’s an easy Pascal square.

Democrats should have hired an ace lawyer to question Kavanaugh. Republicans aren't screwing around here, and we shouldn't, either.
If Brett Kavanaugh were presiding over trial of a man accused of sexual assault &amp; victim's lawyer asked to present testimony from an eyewitness &amp; from others he allegedly assaulted &amp; defense objected to the witnesses, Kavanaugh would overrule the objection &amp; allow the witnesses.
Brett Kavanaugh, you're on my dunzo list.
It's worth mentioning that any 2 GOP Senators, standing together, could ensure a just process by saying publicly that they will vote no unless there is an FBI investigation first, a hearing involving all relevant witnesses - including Mark Judge - &amp; lag time btw hearing &amp; vote.
All of the reasons why due process &amp; basic fairness demand that the Senate wait until after Thursday to decide upon the nature and timing of next steps are reasons why the Senate GOP is rushing to a next-day vote. They intend to deprive the proceedings of due process &amp; fairness.
They don't want individual Senators to have a few days to reflect on and assess what they've heard, decide whom they believe, and decide what the best vote is as a result of such a process?
They don't want journalists to have the opportunity to dig into new claims and statements or for witnesses who are watching and can corroborate or disprove those statements to have a chance to come forward with their stories?
If either Ford or Kavanaugh says something new, something they haven't said before, which isn't out of the question in an hours-long hearing focused on one topic, they don't want the opportunity to try to corroborate or disprove those statements?
THREAD: Senate GOP scheduling a vote in advance for the day after Kavanaugh-Ford hearing is outrageous. There's nothing that could possibly happen Thursday that they think would merit further investigation, additional witnesses, or a second day of hearing?

If everything Dr. Blasey alleges is true - and I believe her - I think it’s a close question whether Judge Kavanaugh’s conduct as a 17-year-old disqualifies him to be a Supreme Court justice now. But him lying about it as a 53-year-old is disqualifying without doubt.
I believe most mistakes 17-year-olds make should not follow them for rest of their lives, but GOP Senators don’t. They believe in trying &amp; sentencing black teenagers as adults, executing minors convicted of capital crimes &amp; denying women right to terminate unwanted pregnancies.
Everything GOP Senators have done since Dr. Blasey came forward makes it clear that they think she is telling the truth and are conspiring to help Judge Kavanaugh avoid the consequences of both his conduct as a 17-year-old &amp; his subsequent lies about it.

If Grassley, McConnell, or any GOP Sen calling Dr. Ford a liar really thought she’s lying, theyd call her bluff &amp; ask FBI to investigate. Lying to FBI is a crime (see Flynn, Michael &amp; Manafort, Paul). They think Kavanaugh’s lying &amp; don’t want to put him in position to lie to FBI.
Rule of thumb: in any situation where it’s one person’s word against another’s, the one who is eager to submit to an FBI investigation is probably the one who is telling the truth.

If you are a GOP Senator &amp; you vote no on Kavanaugh because you find his personal behavior &amp; his lies distasteful, you'll get to vote yes on a new nominee who is just as conservative in 3 months. And you'll get to sleep a little bit better every night between now &amp; then.
It's great Sens Flake &amp; Corker want to delay a vote on Kavanaugh until Dr. Christine Blasey Ford's allegations receive fair hearing. But Flake &amp; Corker have power to make sure that happens, by saying publicly they'll vote no if the vote isn't delayed. They haven't done that yet.

If Dems take Senate in November, they can stop any Trump judicial nominee - to any court - who is outside judicial mainstream or has engaged in disqualifying personal behavior. If Kavanaugh disgusts you, go knock on doors/make calls for Beto O'Rourke or Claire McCaskill.
We can discuss whether forcing yourself on a woman when you're 18 disqualifies you to be on SCOTUS when you're 50. But if you're Brett Kavanaugh &amp; you want to have that conversation, you have to start by admitting what you did to Christine Blasey Ford &amp; apologizing to her.
For what it's worth, Brett Kavanaugh has never sexually assaulted me. So if you add me to the 65 women who signed a letter saying he never assaulted them, there are now at least 66 people Kavanaugh has never assaulted. But the number of people you're allowed to assault is zero.
@mittromney showed courage during AL special elex when he said, early &amp; publicly, "I believe Leigh Corfman."		He wasn't running for anything then and, unlike Moore, Kavanaugh is kind of guy Romney rubs elbows with. Can he find courage to say now "I believe Christine Blasey Ford"?
The fact that GOP had a letter from 65 women Kavanaugh never assaulted (congrats on finding a few women he didn't try to rape) ready to go means Kavanaugh told Trump's people something like this was out there. Which means Kavanaugh is lying &amp; he did assault Christine Blasey Ford.
If we confirm Kavanaugh now &amp; it turns out he's lying, he'll be on SCOTUS for life &amp; it'll be too late.  If we wait 3 mos &amp; it turns out Christine Blasey Ford is lying, we can confirm Kavanaugh then.		I believe Ford. But either way, it's a pretty easy risk/reward Pascal square.

@SenKamalaHarris @starincali I believe Judge Kavanaugh lied in response to your question when he said he didn't remember speaking to anyone at the firm in question about the Mueller investigation. I believe he does remember one or more specific conversations, and that he lied when he said he didn't.
Kamala Harris just owned Brett Kavanaugh and every old white GOP Senator in the room when she said with a wry smile on her face, "I think you're thinking of someone and you don't want to tell us."		I'm near certain that Kavanaugh lied in response to her question.

If there was nothing in Brett Kavanaugh's record as high-ranking official in the warmongering, torture-happy, gaybashing Bush administration that would terrify mainstream Americans, GOP wouldn't be hiding more than 90% of it from public view while rushing his nomination through.
I don’t think Kavanaugh seems like a bad guy, nor that he is evil or corrupt. He is an accomplished man w extremist right-wing views way outside the judicial mainstream - so far outside that GOP is hiding his past work from us. That’s why he should not be a Supreme Court justice.
I suspect one of the reasons Trump &amp; Chuck Grassley are hiding the vast majority of Judge Kavanaugh’s documents from the Bush administration is that those documents will prove he lied to the Senate in 2006 when he said he was not involved in the administration’s torture program.

I can only imagine that he decided there were worse things than dying or losing an election. The lesson I take from the life John McCain lived is: whatever scares you, it may be worth being afraid of, but allowing it to make you less than who you aspire to be is always worse.
I'm sure Sen McCain was afraid of losing the 2008 election when he refused to use Bill Ayers to go after then-Sen. Obama or stoke fears of him as "the other." But he refused to smear a good man who happened to be his opponent.
The thing that impressed me most about John McCain is that he refused to let fear determine his choices. I'm sure he was afraid of dying in the Vietcong prison camp where he was a POW, but he refused to use his father's standing to obtain early release.
NFL players are not protesting the anthem, Senator. They are protesting frequent assassination of black kids by cops. What's more, you know what they're protesting &amp; you're lying to Texans.

Democrats largely seem on the defensive on the issue of impeachment as a campaign issue, which is insane. The super easy answer to that question is: we’ll impeach Trump if he deserves it. Republicans won’t impeach him no matter what Mueller finds and no matter what Trump does.
John McCain will enter the history books as the last great GOP Senator, and the last GOP leader who had the moral courage to do the right thing when he knew it would cost him politically. I hope he enters them later and not sooner, but he will enter them as a hero and a giant.

Trump (aka Public Nixon) is a terrible poker player. This means Trump knows there is something explosive for Mueller to find &amp; that Mueller either has it or is getting closer. https://t.co/Uh0LZoez6N

If Michael Avenatti wants to defeat Trump in 2020, this is exactly what he should be doing - going on TV &amp; beating crap out of Trump &amp; his spoxes, while our nominee takes the high road &amp; talks about big ideas.

We cannot make our Senators vote no on Kavanaugh.  But we can make sure that they know that, if they vote yes, their political careers are over.
@CasablancaRic @BarackObama I'm being super generous to myself with my use of "we."  I was not part of the campaign's inner circle.
@CasablancaRic @BarackObama Agreed. There's a line between fighting hard &amp; fighting dirty. Most elected Dems should fight harder more often. We threw some tough punches in 2012 campaign - if you don't remember Romnesia, google it - you'll have a good laugh. But it was always about Romney's policy positions.
When they go low, we go high. When they go high, we go higher.  It's not performative. This is who we are &amp; this is where we live.  Democrats are the good guys &amp; we need to act like it.  @MichaelAvenatti does not get that &amp; must not be allowed to be our standard bearer.

Michael Avenatti's "when they go low, we hit harder" is an implicit rebuke of the fundamental goodness of Barack &amp; Michelle Obama. @BarackObama won two landslides &amp; was one of history's great presidents &amp; lived every moment of it with dignity. Avenatti is wrong about how we win.

@MittRomney is 100% right that Pres. Trump’s equivocation on racism is electorally disqualifying. If Romney really believes that, he should commit publicly to voting to remove Trump from office. Pretty words from image-conscious Republicans are not good enough. We demand action.
If any President 18-44 were in office right now, he’d be marching with the anti-Nazi protestors today. @realDonaldTrump is in New Jersey composing All Lives Matter, the remix.
The NFL has a chance to win me back as a fan by declining to discipline the players who took a knee last night, and by making clear it won’t punish any player who does so all season long.

Trump wants a Space Force by 2020 just so that, when he has to get on television to concede to @DevalPatrick, he can say, "I realize I lost bigly, but I won the popular vote if you count the 10 million astronauts who voted illegally."
@anon6116 Of course I'd vote for Avenatti against Trump should he win our nomination, but I think we can do a lot better for our nominee &amp; the next president. "Better than Trump" is a very low bar &amp; it's not the standard I want us to aspire to.
Our 2020 nominee can't be someone who tries to out-Trump Trump, or whose entire campaign is based on anger at him, justified as that anger is. S/he must be someone with a positive vision that inspires us &amp; the experience to execute it. That's not Michael Avenatti.
Michael Avenatti isn't remotely qualified to be President. He's done a great job as Stormy Daniels' lawyer &amp; public advocate, but there's no indication that he knows anything about foreign policy, health care, tax policy, etc. There are several qualified, charismatic Dems who do.
I'm happy to live in a country that welcomes Melania Trump's parents. I'd just like to live in a country that also welcomes parents of Americans from all places &amp; circumstances, including those who aren't married to someone who committed crimes to steal the presidency.
If you're a constituent of Devin Nunes' and you think Congress should leave Mueller &amp; Rosenstein the hell alone &amp; let them do their jobs, vote for @JanzforCongress.  Andrew has devoted his career to upholding the rule of law, and he doesn't think the President is above it.
What do you get for a military that has everything? Space Force!		Wr already spend more on defense than next 19 nations combined, nearly all allies (or were before Trump started trashing them &amp; NATO). Here’s a thought: spend less on military &amp; more on behavior lessons for POTUS.
The judge in the Manafort trial seems like a real cowboy in a not-so-good way.
Rod Rosenstein will not be taken down by a small fraction of a man like Devin Nunes. We will not permit it.  The voters are coming.

@artsycarol 2 thoughts on this:	1. Trump is most likely to pardon if he thinks it will fire up his base. His base liked Arpaiao for years before Trump was a pol &amp; barely knows who Collins is. But he may become a cause celebre on right.	2. It’s near impossible to predict what Trump will do.
Two of Trump’s three campaign managers have been charged with crimes since he hired them, and the third is Steve Bannon.
I dislike Chris Collins, and if he indeed committed insider trading (it seems there is strong evidence he did), I hope he is punished appropriately. But I will not be gleeful about him going to prison because that’s unseemly &amp; the kind of thing Trump supporters would do.
@BrandiHennemann I don't think it's quite as simple as that. For example, a candidate has separate primary and general election campaign funds, and there is some walling off of the two from each other. Really helped us define Romney early in 2012.  Are you sure it's as simple as you've said?
@DenzildeanNY Or...wait for it...they're irrational &amp; unable to connect their behavior to its consequences for their own lives.
@DenzildeanNY Pres. Obama did more for environment than any POTUS in history. Al Gore would've been just as good on Greens' issues. If Nader hadn't run in 2000 &amp; Stein hadn't run in 2016, the earth might be half a degree cooler &amp; countless lives saved &amp; extreme weather disasters avoided.
@DenzildeanNY They're an hysterical, single-issue party that would rather shout about why they are angry than work within an imperfect system to actually address their concerns.  Mainstream Democrats are pretty good on environmental issues.  Let's elect a ton of them &amp; see how it works out.
@DenzildeanNY I understand your point, but clearly way more voters prefer Dems to Greens (I'm basically a Green on environmental issues, but the Green Party has nothing close to a full policy platform). When Dems &amp; Greens poll anywhere near even, that argument would have some purchase.
Q for 2% of political twitter that's wonkier than I: does O'Connor staying close enough that OH Sec-State won't certify #OH12 results for weeks mean he can spend special election campaign funds on November race btw now and then in a way he couldn't have if the race been called?
The Green Party has a right to run a candidate for any office it likes. But if it really cares about solving climate change, increasing fuel efficiency standards &amp; regulating factory farms, it shouldn't run candidates, but instead do its best to elect as many Dems as possible.
By running candidates in competitive elections that Democrats otherwise would have won, the Green Party is doing irreparable damage to our environment. #OH12
If you live in #OH12, the video of Troy Balderson thanking President Trump combined with Trump's gloating tweet should be enough to get you to the polls for Danny O'Connor this November.
@BKast21 Gov. Kasich set the date for this election back in January. Obv. no idea if OSU calendar was part of his thinking. Even though he endorsed Balderson, I suspect he was rooting for O'Connor. The worse GOP does in 2018, the better his shot in 2020 primary.		https://t.co/hYTeDf3Yen
@BKast21 Don't know.  In most states, the governor sets the dates for special elections.  Not sure about Ohio law.  Will look it up...stay tuned.
When #OH12 moves from dress rehearsal to the main stage in November, Ohio State students who are home for the summer right now will put Danny O'Connor over the top.		The young people will vote. The young people will win.  The young people will give us the Congress we deserve.
@MarkAlexMclenna That's not even 0.9 percent funny.
If this #OH12 special had taken place during the school year, Ohio State students would have been more than enough to put O'Connor over the top.
@RuthLoisDev Not complaining. I donated to the guy. I’m just expressing my opinion. I think he’s an okay but unimpressive candidate. He’s much better as a pol than I am as a golfer.  		Unfollows are free &amp; I agree you shouldn’t follow someone unless you agree with every single word they say.
Danny O’Connor is a good guy who is painfully unexceptional as a candidate.  And he is in a nailbiter in a district both Trump &amp; Romney won by double digits. Trump’s &amp; GOP’s brands are garbage because their hearts &amp; minds are garbage. #OH12
Trump lost California by 30 pts in 2016. Gov. Brown won it by 35 in 2014. Brown has taken significant action to address climate change, Trump is a science denier who actively pollutes our air &amp; water. Who do you trust to deal with wildfires? #HolyFire

@Brian_Egan This is an area in which Obama administration should have done more. They cooperated w ICC in many cases, but didn’t adopt the Rome statute. I doubt it could’ve gotten thru Congress (I assume it constitutes a treaty), but they didn’t try, which I suspect was bc of drone strikes.
@Brian_Egan IMO, the proper forum for this is Int’l Criminal Court, but neither US nor Russia consents to its jurisdiction. Curiously, Russia withdrew from it about a week after the 2016 election (but said the withdrawal was about Crimea).
@Brian_Egan Sure, but DOJ already has charged the Russian state in the form of the 12 GRU agents the week before last.  But regardless of legality, I think the idea of one country charging the head of another with intra-national crimes is problematic.
@CasablancaRic I’m not sure Flake &amp; Corker are listening to an unknown liberal lawyer with barely more than 2K followers. But I think telling them that we admire them for their principles, but are quite frustrated with how little of substance they’ve done to check Trump is a decent message.

There is no world in which Vladimir Putin gets to question Michael McFaul but Robert Mueller doesn't get to question Donald Trump.

Today’s Mueller indictments make it seem increasingly likely that President Trump is an unindicted coconspirator in Russia’s crimes regarding the 2016 election.

All 12 GRU members indicted by Robert Mueller today must be extradited to the US to face trial, and until they are, the US &amp; all of its allies must suspend all trade with Russia, all Russian assets abroad must be frozen, and Russia must be removed from the UN Security Council.
Any legitimate POTUS would go on TV in advance of mtg w Putin, condemn GRU indictees for their crimes, warn that extradition to face US charges will be items 1, 2 &amp; 3 on mtg agenda &amp; make clear that, if all 12 aren’t extradited, Russia will be excommunicated from world economy.

An additional reason Kavanaugh’s nomination is so dangerous is it opens up a spot on the D.C. Circuit, America’s second-most important court, which Trump will fill with a conservative extremist. The DC Circuit hears more cases about presidential authority than any other court.

@MarkAlexMclenna Sure - when it comes to oil, it's just a question of from where you get it. But since the EU has both the desire &amp; the ability to put the screws to Russia, giving it a plentiful source of non-Russian oil might help reorder relationships in a salutary way.
@MarkAlexMclenna PM Trudeau is pretty hot. If he can't close, who can? What Canadian celebrity looks the most like Ivanka?
@MarkAlexMclenna A bit outside the box, but I would've like to see CA temporarily stop selling oil to U.S. and sell that oil to EU (other victim of Trump's tariffs). Would've hurt US w/o being a tariff, would've helped EU, &amp; EU could've imported less Russian oil. Help a good guy, hurt a bad guy.
@MarkAlexMclenna PM Trudeau didn't have any good options.  I don't envy the position in which he found himself.  The first nation to impose tariffs has an easy choice (don't impose tariffs), but the second one is always in a tough spot.
@MarkAlexMclenna And we your patience.  America will be back soon enough, and we will be eminently grateful that you waited for us to regain our senses.  We'll let you annex a city with a hockey team that might bring the Stanley Cup back to the True North.  Seriously, any city you want.

@MarkAlexMclenna Interesting. My guess is Gov.  Cuomo did this by EO bc NY has at least one GOP-controlled branch of legislature (Rs have narrow majority in state senate; don’t know about house) so a bill like CA’s or WA’s isn’t a possibility. A creative way for him to use his executive power.
@MarkAlexMclenna I don't understand what you have in mind - can you explain a bit more?
@MarkAlexMclenna Yes, and they already do. All states do. A law like the one I have in mind would get a constitutional challenge on commerce clause grounds, but I think a well-drafted provision would survive. It would be similar to CA's vehicle emission standards law (which has a complex history)

Unions fought to bring us the minimum wage, the 40-hour standard work week, women's suffrage, the Civil Rights Act, and the first laws banning child labor. They did it b/c they recognize fundamentally that we are all in this together. Strong unions make life better for all... 3/x

Bob Corker got more than 1.5 mil votes (more than 65%) in 2012. He isn't running again b/c he has a problem with Trump voters, but Marsha Blackburn is going to find out in November that she and Trump have a problem with a lot of his voters, too. They're voting for Phil Bredesen.

@DenzildeanNY @dtheavenger You used quotes, but didn't quote me accurately. Not cool.		You also took me way out of context. The first reason I offered why she should've admitted she was wrong is that it was the right thing to do. 		If you're confident in your position, you should be able to argue honestly.
@DenzildeanNY The comparison only is that both things were wrong, it's obvious the person in question knew it was wrong, and refused to say so even though doing the right thing was in her clear self-interest. That's as far as the comparison goes. Of course torture is the worse of the 2 things.
@dtheavenger By 2008, she knew the Iraq War was bullshit.  She should've said so, not just because it was the right thing to do, but also because it was the politically smart thing to do. I think Hillary Clinton would've been a great President, but she's really bad at running for President.
Every struggling white working-class man who voted for Trump because Trump said he would fight to bring back his job now knows he was just another sucker. Donald Trump cares about making life better for exactly one person: Donald Trump.		https://t.co/IdPSSgNCZV
Gina Haspel refusing to say she was wrong for participating in torture reminds me of Hillary in 2008 refusing to say she was wrong to have voted for Iraq war (see also Jeb! 2016).  It's free money &amp; it's inexplicable that she won't take it.

@StacksTindal If I'm wrong, I'll be grateful to you for educating me.  McCain has been on both right and wrong sides of almost every issue,  but I don't remember him ever being on the wrong side of torture.  I think that, because he was tortured by the Vietcong, it's deeply personal for him.
Weird that Drew Bledsoe is trending.  I just mentioned his name today at work; if Steelers hadn't knocked him out of 2001 AFC Championship Game, Tom Brady might never have become Tom Brady.  Steelers might have another couple of SB rings.
@StacksTindal Has he flip-flopped in torture?  To best of my knowledge, he’s been consistently against torture in all forms since Bush43 administration when Guantanamo was in the news.  I was a teenager then, so was just starting to pay attention to that sort of thing.

@jcoopermedic @GoldenKnights @SanJoseSharks Easy, killer.  I'm rooting for Vegas.  I'm a Penguins' fan, and Marc-Andre Fleury is my favorite player.  In my view, the Sharks have played better hockey than the Knights overall over the course of this series.  Just calling it like I see it, bae.
The Sharks are the better team &amp; it isn't close, but it just doesn't seem to matter. #VGKvsSJ #StanleyCup
If Vegas loses in a close, low-scoring series in the conference finals, Marc-Andre Fleury should be the first player in NHL history to be considered for the Conn Smythe without his team even making the finals. #VGKvsSJS #StanleyCup
I can't help but think that, if Marc-Andre Fleury were the #Pens goalie this playoff, last night's game might have been a 3-2 Pens win that wrapped up a 4-1 Pens' series win. Holtby is outplaying a Pens' goalie for the first time in his career. #3elieve

If the Caps manage to finally get over the hump by beating the Champs, it'll be their bad luck that a team as deep and disciplined as the Lightning is waiting for them.  The #Pens have been lucky to face merely above-average teams in the East finals the past two years. #3elieve

then his invocation would be evidence in impeachment or civil proceedings that he has committed crimes. The only place an invocation of Fifth Amendment rights can't be basis for an inference against you is a criminal proceeding. 5A protects us from jail &amp; not from anything else.
If President Trump seeks to invoke Fifth Amendment in proceedings w Special Counsel Mueller or Stormy Daniels, he may be required to explain to a judge his basis for invoking it. If judge concludes the invocation is legit (my guess is she would b/c Trump has committed crimes) (2)
You do not have a right take Fifth Amendment unless you reasonably believe you've committed one or more crimes. If a judge concludes you are seeking to invoke it frivolously, she will not permit you to do so, direct you to answer questions &amp; hold you in contempt if you don't. (1)
President Trump has every right to take the Fifth Amendment if he reasonably believes he committed one or more crimes. He does not, however, have the right not to have Congress &amp; American people use such a tacit admission to criminal conduct as a basis to remove him from office.

What I mean here is that, if the payment by Cohen started as an in-kind contribution to the Trump campaign, it can’t be converted after the fact into a personal loan just by Trump giving Cohen $130k. https://t.co/3JGYvWazYN
Even if Trump repaid Cohen from personal funds, it may well be a campaign finance violation. Campaigns aren't allowed to borrow from anyone other than candidate himself &amp; unless there are docs demonstrating this was personal loan to Trump, he is still in trouble on CF front. https://t.co/czX5ryJCPY
Team Trump must have known that a story about him reimbursing Cohen the $130k hush Stormy payment was going to break and sent Rudy Giuliani on Hannity as part of a coherent strategy to get ahead of the story, right? Right?
When Rudy Giuliani said "some Stormy Daniels woman," he was trying a little too hard to seem like a guy who hadn't seen her work years ago.

@BKast21 You get an offer, you better proffer!
@BKast21 @StormyDaniels @MichaelAvenatti I seriously - no tricks, no wikipedia - think the President's rationale was, "If I hire TGWUTBRG to be my lawyer, he won't be allowed to testify against me about anything he knows that happened during the campaign."
I can see about 10 significant legal problems Rudy Giuliani just created for President Trump with his Hannity interview, and I couldn't carry the briefcase of a single lawyer on Mueller's team.
If Michael Cohen has told FBI in connection w SDNY investigation that Trump never repaid the $130k, Rudy Giuliani saying contrary on Hannity (if true) would make Cohen guilty of lying to the FBI, which would give the US Attorney more leverage to use to get Cohen to turn on Trump.
When Rudy Giuliani told Hannity that "I take care of things like this for my clients," he was acknowledging that he makes and accepts settlement offers on behalf of his clients without their approval, which is a violation of ABA Model Rule of Professional Conduct 1.4
Rudy Giuliani and Sean Hannity seem not to know that "funneling" money is the same thing as "laundering" it.
If Hannity had found one journalistic bone in the pile of chicken wings he ate for dinner, much less had one in his own body, when Rudy Giuliani said Trump repaid Cohen's $130k, his next word would have been "when?"
Rudy Giuliani is too stupid for words. In one #Foxlandia sentence, he ensured Trump's banking &amp; financial records will be discoverable in @StormyDaniels lawsuit. If Trump repaid Cohen as Giuliani claims, records showing when are relevant evidence @MichaelAvenatti is entitled to.
One undercovered aspect of the Mueller questions Team Trump leaked earlier this week:  the questions about the Trump Tower meeting with Russian operatives would invite President Trump to throw Don Jr. under the bus without realizing he's doing it.

The saying "a good lawyer never asks a question to which she doesn't know the answer" applies to trial.  It doesn't apply to something like Mueller's interview with Trump, in which there is no reason for Mueller to limit himself to questions to which he already knows the answers.
The release of the Special Counsel's questions makes one thing clear:  call him a subject, a target, or whatever else, but Mueller thinks Trump committed crimes &amp; is going to probe hard.
A bit like President Obama, in the first 2008 debate, politely referring to Senator McCain as "John."  He was polite, but clearly sent the message that he knew he belonged on the stage &amp; he saw McCain as his peer, someone worthy of respect, but not deference. https://t.co/4IOA7nuWkG
I like that Michael Avenatti refers to POTUS as "Mr. Trump." Respectful, but the message is clear:  you may be the President to most people, but to me, you're just another guy I'm gonna beat. Stormy Daniels picked the right guy to be the public face of her lawsuit. #basta

The only joke Michelle Wolf made for which anyone should consider criticizing her is the one in which she called Sanders a white woman version of an Uncle Tom.  I think that's a racist term &amp; hearing it makes me cringe.  Every other joke she made was most apropos.
All of you posting that you're a big fan of POTUS46 - it's a little funny, but if it turns out the next person to occupy the White House is Mike Pence (which isn't out of the question), you will learn quickly that you can't delete the internet.
John Kelly calling President Trump an idiot is a bit like Canada saying the North Pole is cold.
Delaying tariffs on Canada, Mexico &amp; EU 30 days is better than letting them take effect tomorrow, but lack of policy consistency is bad for business &amp; intl trade climates. I sound like such a C-Span Republican when I say that (I feel like I need a starched collar), but it's true.

In 2011, Pres Obama had the courage to put on a poker face &amp; tell jokes at #WHCD while his stomach was in knots knowing Seal Team 6 was en route to Abbottabad b/c he knew it'd be suspicious if he didn't. Tonight, Donald Trump didn't have the courage to face a few journalists.
Fleury using his paddle to coolly tip the puck to himself shows he is comfortable AF in overtime.  Great sign for the Knights. #VegasBorn #StanleyCup

@decakarjeffrey That's not necessarily accurate. I know a lot more about these processes than you might have thought I did.
Pres Trump refused to vet his nominee for VA Sec &amp; Sen Tester took seriously his own responsibility to do so. Tester only stated what was alleged &amp; that Senate was looking into it. Trump is feeling guilty for throwing Jackson under the bus bc he assumed allegations were all true.
Allegations made by Donald Trump about President Obama's birthplace &amp; validity of his birth certificate have been proven false.  Even after confronted with proof that Obama was born in Hawaii, Trump insisted on furthering a racist fringe conspiracy theory. Trump should resign. https://t.co/77lhQd4VmL
Thank you for offering your opinion.  I'm always happy to engage in high-minded debate about the issues. https://t.co/dEMhGGqdSo
Sen. Jon Tester didn't say Dr. Jackson had gotten drunk on govt travel &amp; wrecked a govt vehicle. He said those were allegations, which was true. If Trump admin had vetted Jackson, it would've already known this was out there &amp; been ready with answers.
Some people thought that, once House Speaker Paul Ryan announced his retirement, he would focus his last several months in Congress on constraining the excesses and likely crimes of President Trump.  Instead, he decided to fire Father Conroy for caring too much about poor people.
Morrow said “I’m not even fighting back” about four times, after which the police body slammed him onto the ground. The officers who did this must be fired &amp; the police department must write a big fat check to Morrow. #BlackLivesMatter https://t.co/xlbu7IBVWA

A healthy 33-year-old Marc-Andre Fleury is the best goalie in the NHL. #StanleyCup
3 goals for Vegas is like 7 or 8 for almost any other team. #StanleyCup
Just like in Game 7 last year, Ovechkin was a defensive liability in Game 1 tonight.  He could have prevented two of the Pens' three goals.  That's why he will go down in history as a very good player who should have been great. #CapsPens #3elieve
With no Malkin and no Hagelin for #CapsPens Game 1, the Pens and Caps had more or less even talent on the ice, but Matt Murray is better than Braden Holtby.  That's why the champs won tonight. #3elieve

Really bad goal for Andersen to allow.  Can't do that in a Game 7. #StanleyCup
With that block and walk-off 3 in a 3-second span, LeBron just showed Laura Ingraham that he can dribble pretty well without shutting up.

Kanye is a faux-religious homophobe. Of course he and Trump are hat buddies.
If not for the Fifth Amendment, prosecutors could charge people against whom they’d found absolutely no evidence &amp; make them sit in jail for a year awaiting trial. Michael Cohen getting to hide behind it for 5 minutes before an AUSA nails his ass is more than worth the tradeoff.
Watching Leafs-Bruins reminds me of playing 1-on-1 with my little brother. He was the better basketball player &amp; athlete. It took him longer than it should’ve to beat me for the first time, but once he did, I never beat him again. #StanleyCup #TMLtalk

@chargrille Trump was right when he said this, but he was also wrong, if that makes sense.
We have a Fifth Amendment for good reason &amp; it’s also for good reason that taking the 5th can’t be used against you in a criminal proceeding.  As a constitutional liberal, I celebrate these protections, even when invoked by a scumbag like Michael Cohen. US = advanced citizenship.
The judge would not have allowed Michael Cohen to take the Fifth merely to protect Pres. Trump. Cohen would have needed to convince the judge that he (Cohen) committed a crime, or she would mint have allowed him to invoke his 5th A privilege. That’s...significant.

President Trump, at the White House today, said about President Macron, "he is perfect."  That's such a weird thing for a President to say in so many ways.
I'm no expert in this particular nuance of the interplay between state &amp; federal criminal law, but I think that, if Eric Schneiderman charges Michael Cohen with NY state crimes first, and the US Attorney's Office sits back and does nothing, Trump can't pardon his way out of it.
Judge Bates: President Trump has 90 days to restart DACA or explain yourself without sounding like a xenophobic, jealous-of-Obama, sonofabitch.
I think President Trump invited @EmmanuelMacron to his first State Dinner so he'd have an excuse to serve french fries.
New revelations about Dr. Ronny Jackson cast his fellating diagnosis of Pres Trump in a whole new light. Of course he was drunk when he examined POTUS &amp; again when he conducted press conference.  He’d have to have been drunk to reach those conclusions &amp; say those words out loud.

@StacksTindal @Uber So you know exactly what I mean! Sometimes, David has the advantage against Goliath.  Sometimes, Goliath’s sheer size and armor make it impossible for him to move quickly enough for his enormous strength advantage to matter.
The policy limit is often an indicator of for how much the defendant/client (Uber) may actually be willing to settle, even if they offer much less.  Uber experiences no short-term pain when they settle a claim for $1 million or less.
For those who don’t know much about insurance, this means that, if you are in an accident for which @Uber or one of its drivers or passengers is at fault, James River Insurance Company can pay you up to $1 million without a penny coming from Uber itself.
One thing I've learned is the per-incident policy limit on @Uber's policy w James River Insurance Company is $1 million. I don't intend to demand nearly that much, as my injuries appear unlikely to be permanent, but other accident victims should know this in dealing with @Uber. https://t.co/Op9i8btN9c
@StacksTindal @Uber I promise to keep you updated! When I secure a just result, through settlement or verdict, I'll publicize so others know how to stand up to Uber &amp; powerful corps that mistreat them.

@mattmurray_30 matching Marc-Andre Fleury with his second shutout in four games tonight. #3elieve https://t.co/AvR9DvTS75
Crosby sets Pens all-time playoff scoring record, Letang sets the mark for defensemen, and another Matt Murray shutout.  Oh, and we won five-zip. #3elieve
I want to see Pens score the rub-it-in goal here, just to make a point about what we do when you headhunt one of our guys. #3elieve
I #3elieve that we will win!

It says much of what you need to know about differences btw Obama &amp; Trump that Obama is friendly w inclusive leaders w first-rate minds who were both conservative (Cameron, Merkel) &amp; liberal (Trudeau, Macron) &amp; Trump's only friends are fascist thugs (Putin, Duterte, Erdogan) #FBR
If President Trump fires Mueller or Rosenstein, he needs to become ex-President Trump in a hurry. This is a sine qua non of meaningful democracy.
This was almost exactly 5 years ago. Since, Crosby has won 2 Cups, 2 Conn Smythes, a Hart, an Art Ross, a Richard, &amp; 2 Lindsays.  During same period, Giroux is 0-2 in playoff series. So far this series, Crosby has 5 goals and 4 assists. Giroux has 1 assist. #3elieve #LetsGoPens https://t.co/I299XkF1sv
The puck was in the net before Neuvirth had even turned around. Crosby's Pens-playoff-record-breaking point illustrates perfectly why he is one of the few best ever: no one else on the ice ever seems to know what Sid is up to. #LetsGoPens
This strikes me as a sub-optimal use of the President’s time and mental energy. https://t.co/t7m2pv6SNx

@balletborn @moralinjuryblog I'm flattered by your disagreement with me.  "White and proud" is a disgusting thing to put out in the world, in my opinion, and you should stop saying it.  Yes, Hannity was unmasked as Cohen's client in federal court today by Cohen's attorney upon the order of Judge Kimba Wood.
I have a JD from University of Pittsburgh and an LLM from Georgetown. Why do you ask? https://t.co/cq0WAEZ9gU
@IanJohns11 Sure, but if they didn't commit crimes together, but Hannity paid civil settlement hush money to someone he sexually harassed, for example, whether they had an attorney-client relationship becomes super relevant to the next several years of Hannity's life.
Now that SDNY has searched his lawyer's office &amp; seized records, Sean Hannity is probably glad that he has demonstrated such remarkable restraint in the past year when talking about Mueller, Comey &amp; Rosenstein &amp; no one at DOJ or FBI thinks of him as a propagandist hack asshole.
Everyone knows Michael Cohen is a lousy lawyer. But if it's true that President Trump never paid him back the $130k pornstar payoff he fronted and Sean Hannity never paid him at all, he's a much worse businessman than he is a lawyer.
That 5 on the ice for the #Leafs just decided they ween't letting the puck out of the zone until they put it in the net. #GoLeafsGo
Remember 2 weeks ago when Sean Hannity said "Before commenting on FBI's search of Michael Cohen's office, as a journalist, I must disclose that Mr. Cohen is my lawyer as well as Pres. Trump's &amp; records relating to his representation of me may have been seized." Yeah, me neither.
The only legal (pun intended) work Michael Cohen seems to have done in the past 11 years is negotiating deals to cover up affairs prominent Republicans have had. I wonder what he did for Sean Hannity.  Maybe helped him start a foundation to fight malaria?  Yeah, probably that.
If Sean Hannity never paid Michael Cohen, as he claims, then the two of them do not have an attorney-client relationship, and therefore not a single Hannity-related document FBI seizes from Cohen’s office is privileged.  It’s all admissible in any future court proceeding.
Every time Donald Trump or Sean Hannity has said the phrase “no collusion” in the past year and a half, it likely has been an act of collusion between the two of them to cover up transgressions they committed, proof of which exists in records of their mutual lawyer(ish).
Glad to see #Leafs on the board first! #StanleyCup
Everything Sean Hannity has said about the Mueller investigation in general and the raid of Michael Cohen’s office in particular can be understood as not only the detached ravings of a misogynistic bigot but also appropriation of cable airwaves to protection of his self-interest.

@RandyBoose Which is why Russia must be removed from UN Security Council.  Without Russia, it would be able to function properly to respond to situations like these. UN Charter never envisioned a UNSC member aiding &amp; abetting a war criminal &amp; serial violator of Geneva &amp; other conventions.
Assad has violated int'l law dozens of times &amp; military action against his illegal chemical weapons program is most appropriate. But it must be done either via a Congressional AUMF or a vote of UN Security Council. Processes &amp; institutions matter. Now more than ever.
Russia needs to be removed from UN Security Council. If you are interested in liberalism that can effectively run the world, int'l institutions must be able to enforce int'l law. Nations that reject principles undergirding those institutions shouldn't be allowed to run them.
Syria strikes violated War Powers Act, &amp; also UN Charter bc they weren't authorized by vote of UN Security Council. But its not reasonable to expect int'l community to allow Russia, a UNSC member fighting on behalf of Assad, a war criminal, to block them from enforcing intl law.
#WhatReallyBugsTrump is that America loves Barack Obama &amp; thinks he is smarter, kinder, and better than he is &amp; always will.  What bugs him more is that Trump himself thinks it, too.
Neither Macron nor May said anything like Mission Accomplished.  President Obama never took a victory lap after killing Osama bin Laden. Because leaders don’t spike the football.  And certainly not after the foreign policy equivalent of a six-yard catch.

@DemocracyValues Last point I'd make is foreign policy isn't part of job of Governor of Ohio, so concerns I have about Kucinich's foreign policy views - ones you've adroitly pointed out and others - would be a big drawback if he were running for Senate or for President, but don't matter much here
Damn straight. While we're at it, we should also end Ted Cruz's career as an elected official in this country. https://t.co/LUvueTIKdC
@DemocracyValues I think this is a totally unfair &amp; unfounded smear.  I have seen no evidence that Kucinich is pro-Russia &amp; accusing him of it so lightly cheapens the completely legitimate attacks on Trump as Putin's puppet, in my opinion.
@DemocracyValues I don't believe he said "deep state." And thats not praising Trump; its (incorrectly) painting him a victim. He's wrong abt that &amp; I disagree w him vehemently. He has some weird views on non-policy issues (incl saying he saw UFO) &amp; that makes me nervous. Big upside, big downside.
@DemocracyValues He supported same-sex marriage in 1990s, when Bill Clinton signed DOMA &amp; lots of Dems in Congress voted for it. Ditto living wage &amp; single-payer HC. He took on big biz as Cleveland mayor to prevent city's light rail from being privatized, and saved taxpayers more than $1 billion.
@DemocracyValues While I agree with Daily Kos ideologically on most things, it's not a great hard news source. I'd be careful about citing it in these sorts of spots. You've accurately identified some of Kucinich's negatives, now let me share some of his positives. 3/x
@DemocracyValues He has praised Trump exactly once, to my knowledge - he praised inaugural speech. He was wrong to do it &amp; this gives me pause about his candidacy. He &amp; Trump are wrong on tariffs, but that's not an unorthodox position for a midwestern Dem. Neither party has trade quite right. 2/x
@DemocracyValues I can address all. Tedious to do so on twitter, but I will. Preface: Cordray was fantastic CFPB director &amp; I might prefer him over Kucinich.

Re: reports that Trump is considering firing Rosenstein, @AdamKinzinger says, "let's see what happens." Seeing what happens is precisely the opposite of what decent-ish Congressional Republicans like Kinzinger should do. They should act at once to prevent a Constitutional crisis.
If hockey were a sport in which points were awarded for hitting the post, I'd have reason to brag at the moment.  Unfortunately, hockey is not such a sport.

Depending on what documents Robert Mueller seized from Michael Cohen show, a potential use of them would be to prove Pres Trump is lying if he says he didn't repay $130k Cohen fronted to pay off Stormy Daniels. Atty-client privilege couldn't stop Muller from using them this way.
Attorney-client privilege is a rule of evidence that applies when a party tries to introduce something in a court proceeding. It has zero applicability to what Robert Mueller can or can't seize from Michael Cohen. Laura Ingraham is lying when she insinuates that it does.
The Arizona Supreme Court can stop the state's public universities from giving in-state tuition to DACA recipients. But it can't stop those universities from awarding "DACA scholarships" that would have the exact same effect.  Are you listening, @UofA &amp; @ASU?
Conservative talking point that Robert Mueller seized "attorney-client privileged" material from Michael Cohen couldn't be more disingenuous. If something is privileged, it is inadmissible in a court proceeding. There's no rule against law enforcement seizing privileged material.
Robert Mueller, I like your style. 😎

If you are outraged that Laura Ingraham gets to be on TV, don't watch her show. Don't buy products from companies that advertise on her show. Yelling &amp; screaming just draws more attention to her, and makes people tune in to see what she'll say next. Less talk, more action.
I don't know why @jaketapper took it so easy on Larry Kudlow on #CNNSOTU today.  Why on earth didn't he ask him point blank whether Pres. Trump's statement that a $500b trade deficit meant the U.S. was "losing $500b" was accurate &amp; make him say yes or no? #SundayMorning

@ArseGrammatica Oh boy could he!  Smart people capable of writing funny jokes wanted to work for him, and he can deliver them almost as well as an SNL cast member.
Donald Trump is not going to the White House Correspondents Dinner because he knows he'll be lambasted and booed, and his fragile ego can't take it.  He's one of the softest, most insecure people in public life.  President Obama could take the jokes.

When Trump gives a white person a nickname, he uses 1st name. But he went w Cheatin' Obama, not Cheatin' Barack. 		Pres Obama is a person of unimpeachable integrity. He walked on ice for 8 years &amp; never fell. If you want a character debate, Donald, you should find another target.
Barack Obama hasn't cheated at so much as a game of Candyland in his entire life. Donald Trump, by contrast, has cheated on all three of his wives, every single one of his tax returns, and nearly every subcontractor he's ever hired for a real estate development project.
Rebecca Dallet didn't just win the Wisconsin Supreme Court race; she ran up the score like the Badgers playing South Dakota State.  		This one matters more than a little.  Congrats, Justice-Elect Dallet.  I know you'll be a faithful steward of the law.
If you ice your hamstrings after your street hockey league, not because anything hurts, but just b/c it feels like a good idea, does that mean you're too old to play with 24-year-olds?  Asking for a friend.

Gotta hand it to the Pats - they gave up the 32nd pick in 2017 and in the final analysis got one year of Brandin Cooks and the 23rd pick in 2018 in exchange.

Article I "courts" are the worst.
@alexe5252 In the interest of ending a discussion I no longer find productive, I'll let you have the last word. This'll be my last tweet on this subject. Get one last good shot in &amp; I won't swing back.
@alexe5252 No one is entitled to counsel in deportation proceedings.  That's why your statement that it is "explicit" was inaccurate. But I have no new points to make on this topic. If you aren't convinced now, you never will be. Be well.
@alexe5252 And with relative success, if I may indulge in a moment of arrogance.
@alexe5252 Explicit does not mean what you seem to think it means.
@alexe5252 I'm making the argument that no statute singles out "illegal immigrants" in those exact words as people not entitled to counsel, so it's not explicit.  You said it was explicit &amp; it's not.
@alexe5252 Here's something else you said (to someone else in my twitter feed) a few hours before you said it was scary I'm allowed to practice law in response to my pointing out you'd said inaccurate things:		"So instead of making a logical counterpoint, you choose insults. Fascinating."
@alexe5252 You didn't say illegal immigrants fell under a general definition provided by law.  You said "It explicitly states in US law that illegal immigrants do not have the right to a lawyer in an immigration court. It’s very clear." That's an exact quote &amp; it's inaccurate.
@alexe5252 You have yet to provide a statutory cite or to show me a statute that uses the words "illegal immigrant," as you claimed the law explicitly did. Just admit you were wrong &amp; I'll stop embarrassing you.
This is a fake account. Nebraska has a unicameral legislature with 49 state senators &amp; no "representatives." The author of this tweet is not an elected official in Nebraska or anywhere else, which is why it's not a verified account. Ban this user, @twitter? https://t.co/173YKUKsZa
@alexe5252 What is the cite for that statute &amp; where are the words "illegal immigrant," which you claimed would be there explicitly?
@alexe5252 You deleted your tweet once I pointed out it was inaccurate?
@alexe5252 4. You stated that illegal immigrants have no const rights, period. That's inaccurate. They have right to counsel if on trial for criminal offense, right not have soldiers quartered in their homes during peacetime, right not to be subject to illegal search &amp; seizure &amp; many more.
@alexe5252: Here's what you said. It's not accurate. https://t.co/jLe9QEcU56
@alexe5252 But you said "It explicitly states in US law that illegal immigrants do not have the right to a lawyer in an immigration court. It’s very clear." Show me the statute that says that, please.
@alexe5252 You didn't say not all aspects of Const are "fully protected by law." You said not all aspects of Const are law. Art 6, Sect 2 (Supremacy Clause) says Const &amp; laws enacted pursuant thereto are "the supreme law of the land." Out of either ignorance or imprecision, you were wrong.
@alexe5252 3. You stated that it explicitly stated in US law that illegal immigrants don't have right to counsel in deportation proceedings. That's inaccurate. It doesn't say that in any law. We don't know if someone is an illegal immigrant until those proceedings are over &amp; judge decides.
@alexe5252 2. You stated that certain aspects of Constitution are not law &amp; cited as example that we can take right to vote from felons. That's inaccurate. See Art 6, Sect 2 of Const. All aspects of Const are law, but Const rights aren't absolute (which is why govt can ban assault weapons).
@alexe5252 1. You stated that the reason criminal defendants have a right to counsel &amp; people in deportation proceedings don't is latter aren't citizens. That's inaccurate. The reason is that the former are accused of crimes (&amp; non-citizen criminal defendants have a 6th A right to counsel)
@alexe5252 No. Opinions are neither right nor wrong. Every assertion of fact I have made in support of my opinion is accurate &amp; every contrary assertion of fact you have made is inaccurate.
@alexe5252 You're entitled to that opinion. They are more of me than there are of you. You will live in a country that embraces immigrants &amp; diversity whether you like it or not. We're going to make sure of that.
@alexe5252 The very point of my initial tweet was I think it a travesty that people subject to deportation do not have a right to counsel. Of course I recognize they don't currently have that right. I think Congress ought to give it to them or else we should elect a different Congress.
@alexe5252 Inaccurate. The government has an obligation to provide counsel to any person on trial for a crime, citizen or not.  The govt has no current obligation to provide counsel for anyone placed in deportation proceedings, even if they are a citizen. I'd like the latter to change.
@alexe5252 If you approach this as an argument, it won't go well for you b/c I'm right and I've been practicing law for 8 years.  If you approach it as a discussion where you have the opportunity to learn from someone who knows his stuff, it'll go just fine.
@alexe5252 Would you say the same thing to, for example, a U.S. citizen accused of murder who has never heard of the battered spouse defense but would be acquitted if only she had a lawyer who argued it on her behalf?
I have April 21 in my pool as last day Scott Pruitt is EPA Administrator, but the lobbyist I bet against says he won't make me pay him if I lose.
The first few months of the administration, lots of people said Ivanka Trump was the real First Lady.  I think Stormy Daniels is a better symbolic fit for this administration.
@alexe5252 Being a citizen is but one of many bases for relief from deportation.  Many people in deportation proceedings are legally entitled to an adjustment of status - into a current legal immigration status - under the law &amp; they don't know it b/c they don't have lawyers.
@RWPUSA just took Hugh Hewitt out behind the high school gym and beat him up using only his words.  Hewitt is craven &amp; dishonest, but he isn't stupid &amp; Painter just owned his ass. Imagine this guy on a debate stage.		https://t.co/6a9WMksb2m
@alexe5252 Immigration law is much more complicated than that. I suspect you know that, but if you genuinely don't and would like me to explain some of the relevant nuances, let me know &amp; I'll be happy to do so.
Just as the point of the 6th Amendment right to counsel is not to protect criminals by giving them lawyers, but to protect innocent people who otherwise would be wrongfully convicted because the prosecution has a lawyer &amp; they don’t.
The point is not to protect people who are here illegally. The point is to protect people who are here legally or are otherwise allowed to remain under the law, but who are being wrongfully deported bc they don’t have counsel. 1/2 https://t.co/yR02SmWGxp

...except that nearly 100% of persons summoned to imm court for deportation proceedings are non-citizens (if they were citizens, they wouldn’t be removable under imm law). A US citizen wrongly placed in deportation proceedings wouldn’t have a right to a lawyer, either...3/x
...in immigration court. John Oliver and I (&amp; others commenting here) think a statute guaranteeing a lawyer in imm court would be a great idea &amp; that the current state of affairs is tragic. This issue doesn’t inherently have anything to do with citizens vs. non-citizens...2/x
We’ve gone astray from the relevant legal topic. Alex, the Constitution guarantees you a lawyer if you are accused of a crime. It doesn’t guarantee you a lawyer in civil matters. It would not prohibit a statute from guaranteeing you a lawyer if you are subject to removal... 1/x https://t.co/D9XIGiDgmn
Yick Wo is one of SCOTUS’ most interesting decisions to me, as both 14 A &amp; math nerd. Not only do const rights apply to all present in US, but whether someone is a citizen often is at issue in imm proceedings, so declaring one non-cit &amp; denying rights feels eerily like Dred Scot. https://t.co/FgnXMpIH1t

@dtheavenger I mean that those sorts of people should go, but they should go because people stop watching their show, not because their network was browbeaten into firing them.
Only 37% of immigrants subject to deportation in immigration court proceedings have a lawyer, per John Oliver &amp; #LastWeekTonight.  Because it isn't criminal court, there's no constitutional right to a lawyer.  That's a travesty Congress should fix yesterday.
We can't make everyone who we don't like shut up &amp; go away, nor is doing so part of our American ethos. The answer lies in convincing our friends &amp; neighbors that there are people out their more worthy of their attention.
