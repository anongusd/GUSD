@KamalaHarris There are a lot of individual government programs not being funded because Democrats refuse to include a paltry 5 billion to improve security.
@SenKamalaHarris Then pay for the wall that ALL of you Dems have repeatedly voted for in the past

@Yamiche @KamalaHarris @iamcardib Nice fluff piece ! How about her participation in presenting false charges against Judge Kavanaugh ? Try being a journalist first and a progressive second #bias
@Yamiche It‚Äôs a when did stop beating your wife question. Not very subtle .Did you ever ask Obama why he met with Al Sharpton 100 times or Sen Harris about the false Kavanaugh allegations?
@SenJeffMerkley You don‚Äôt ‚Äúfund‚Äù tax cuts. You libs need growth in the economy to fund your budget .1.8%  doesn‚Äôt cut it, 4% is a great sign for you so you can steal more of other people‚Äôs money

@nytimes When the statute is present to Congress for consideration it should be named ‚ÄúHarry‚Äôs Law‚Äùin honor or Senator Reid. He introduced similar legislation in 1993, his speech is available for viewing.
@realDonaldTrump @TomFitton Great idea. But should be done by statute so that illegals and maternity tourists don‚Äôt game our laws. Do liberals like original text of Constitution now ? Seems there is room to address this issue via Congressional action.

@SenatorDurbin Senator, You voted against Kyoto in 1997 and never brought it up when Obama  was President #hypocrite
@SharylAttkisson @instapundit This is typical of how Obama and his administration acted. If someone disagreed with them they were treated as dissidents. These are the same folks that had Al Sharpton as a key adviser .#worstAGever
@SenatorDurbin Democrats vote for war and complain , vote for Patriot Act and complain , vote for a border wall and complain, vote for no child left behind and complain. Vote for Medicare D and complain. They never had a vote to ‚Äúcure‚Äù	Climate change when they had the chance ! #hypocrites
@SenatorDurbin Hey Senator, Didn‚Äôt you vote against Kyoto ? I believe it was 95-0 rejection so not one Democrat seems to believe in climate change either
