@LonWoock @stevemc48202960 @TexitDarling @HAUSofABE @Bonkers4Berrys @kendrick_kevin @parscale If Carter Page thinks his rights were violated he can sue the FBI and have his day in court.
@LonWoock @stevemc48202960 @TexitDarling @HAUSofABE @Bonkers4Berrys @kendrick_kevin @parscale They never lied about it. 		They never gave speeches in Russia denouncing the US.
@LonWoock @stevemc48202960 @TexitDarling @HAUSofABE @Bonkers4Berrys @kendrick_kevin @parscale Everything that was in the Warrant application turned out to be true.
@MakeALibTardCry @mitchellvii Ok. They're ready but not being paid.		(Ôºõ‰∏Ä_‰∏Ä)
@LonWoock @stevemc48202960 @TexitDarling @HAUSofABE @Bonkers4Berrys @kendrick_kevin @parscale Carter Page's treatment has not been the official reason given for any firings or removals from the FBI. 		But it is curious that most of those removed are experts in Russian espionage or Russian organized crime. 		Who would want them removed?
@LonWoock @stevemc48202960 @TexitDarling @HAUSofABE @Bonkers4Berrys @kendrick_kevin @parscale We'll that is where I'll have to disagree with you. 		And Comey was fired because for publicly announcing Hillary Clinton was under investigation. 		And McCabe was fired for releasing information about Clinton to the press and not admitting it.
@MakeALibTardCry @mitchellvii Source?
@LonWoock @stevemc48202960 @TexitDarling @HAUSofABE @Bonkers4Berrys @kendrick_kevin @parscale All the Federal Judge's who ok the warrant (initial and renewals) were Republican appointees. 		Do you think they would issue a warrant without sufficient cause?
@LonWoock @stevemc48202960 @TexitDarling @HAUSofABE @Bonkers4Berrys @kendrick_kevin @parscale He most certainly did.
@LonWoock @stevemc48202960 @TexitDarling @HAUSofABE @Bonkers4Berrys @kendrick_kevin @parscale Cherry Picking. This just picks the parts of the Nunes memo which are true. That doesn't make the central premise true. 		See the Democratic response to the memo. It shows clearly that the Nunes Memo was disingenuous. 		https://t.co/4ZYb4qyeRz
@CNN So there you have it. Trump's witness tampering is working. 		Trump- ‚Äú[Cohen] should give information maybe on his father-in-law, because that‚Äôs the one that people want to look at,‚Äù Trump told FOX News host Jeanine Pirro. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs the money in the family.‚Äù		This is a crime. #ITM

@LonWoock @stevemc48202960 @TexitDarling @HAUSofABE @Bonkers4Berrys @kendrick_kevin @parscale So my question is why would Nunes put out a misleading memo to try and protect Trump? He at the time was the chairman of the house intelligence committee who was supposed to be investigating Russia's attack on our election.

@LonWoock @stevemc48202960 @TexitDarling @HAUSofABE @Bonkers4Berrys @kendrick_kevin @parscale So it seems the FBI would've been derelict in there duty if they didn't look into it. 		But as far as this being an attempt to Spy on Trump, Carter Page was no longer working for the campaign when the FISA warrant was issued.
@LonWoock @stevemc48202960 @TexitDarling @HAUSofABE @Bonkers4Berrys @kendrick_kevin @parscale You would provide as much information as possible. 		It turned out that Carter Page did indeed meet with Russians, which he at first denied. He had also been in contact with Russian spies as early as 2013.
@LonWoock @stevemc48202960 @TexitDarling @HAUSofABE @Bonkers4Berrys @kendrick_kevin @parscale They said that the source (Steele) was credible. And he is. He was a former MI6 British Intelligence officer and an expert in Russian espionage. who had worked with the FBI many times.
@LonWoock @stevemc48202960 @TexitDarling @HAUSofABE @Bonkers4Berrys @kendrick_kevin @parscale And he did meet with Russians. https://t.co/B9rUbSnEIc
@LonWoock @stevemc48202960 @TexitDarling @HAUSofABE @Bonkers4Berrys @kendrick_kevin @parscale I don't know the exact place it was placed in the FISA warrant since the warrant hasn't been released but it was in a subsection.
@LonWoock @stevemc48202960 @TexitDarling @HAUSofABE @Bonkers4Berrys @kendrick_kevin @parscale Steele gave his memos (the dossier) to David Corn of Mother Jones in October of 2016 who wrote an article about the allegations. This was the first instance of it mentioned in the press. 		So I'm not sure who your saying leaked it. 		Also how do you know they lead with it?
@LonWoock @stevemc48202960 @TexitDarling @HAUSofABE @Bonkers4Berrys @kendrick_kevin @parscale The Justice Department referred to the Yahoo News article ‚Äî as well as another one the Republican memo failed to mention ‚Äî ‚Äúnot to provide separate corroboration for Steele‚Äôs reporting, but instead to inform the court of Page‚Äôs public denial of his suspected meetings in Moscow.‚Äù
@stevemc48202960 @LonWoock @TexitDarling @HAUSofABE @Bonkers4Berrys @kendrick_kevin @parscale Ok if you don't like CNN directly quoting McCabe. Here's the response from the Democratic members of the Intelligence committee to the Nunes Memo. 		https://t.co/MLxKPIQQ5I		Spells out very clearly that the Dossier was not the primary evidence given for the warrant.
@stevemc48202960 @LonWoock @TexitDarling @HAUSofABE @Bonkers4Berrys @kendrick_kevin @parscale Wow. What an argument.
@LonWoock @stevemc48202960 @TexitDarling @HAUSofABE @Bonkers4Berrys @kendrick_kevin @parscale https://t.co/0oJls8MMfH
@LonWoock @stevemc48202960 @TexitDarling @HAUSofABE @Bonkers4Berrys @kendrick_kevin @parscale The Nunes memo was a much better example of Fraud. 		And once again, Carter Page was no longer working for the campaign when the FISA warrant was issued. And the Russia Investigation started before the Dossier was given to the FBI.

@stevemc48202960 @LonWoock @TexitDarling @HAUSofABE @Bonkers4Berrys @kendrick_kevin @parscale The so-called dossier formed only a smart part of the evidence used to meet the legal burden of establishing "probable cause" that Page was an agent of Russia.		https://t.co/e1iGz5WGQR
@TexitDarling @HAUSofABE @stevemc48202960 @Bonkers4Berrys @kendrick_kevin @parscale The FBI disclosed to the court that Steele was paid by people seeking to discredit Trump. But the FBI viewed Steele as credible. 		Regardless, the Steele Dossier was not the basis for the beginning of the Russia Investigation.
@LonWoock @TexitDarling @HAUSofABE @stevemc48202960 @Bonkers4Berrys @kendrick_kevin @parscale It was unverified at the time of his testimony. 		Here's a good recap of what has been found since. 		https://t.co/GzEFFj6cLO
@TexitDarling @HAUSofABE @stevemc48202960 @Bonkers4Berrys @kendrick_kevin @parscale The article you linked to is an opinion piece not written by a journalist.  		Many of the assertions in it have been debunked. 	The court was aware that the Dossier was opposition research.
@TexitDarling @HAUSofABE @stevemc48202960 @Bonkers4Berrys @kendrick_kevin @parscale Much of the Steele dossier has been proven correct. None of it disproven. It was not the sole basis for the FISA warrant. Carter Page he had been recruited by Russian spies in 2013. He had left the Campaign when the FISA warrant was issued. Russia investigation was started B4.

@JackPosobiec Watch the video on YouTube with Audio. You‚Äôll see how ridiculous this all is.
@JackPosobiec Panic mode is right. Right wing propaganda machine in full effect to distract from Trump‚Äôs Obstruction of Justice.
@JackPosobiec @Acosta He said ‚ÄúPardon me Ma‚Äôam‚Äù at the very moment. 		Watch the real tape with audio. Not the edited version you guys are spreading that speeds up his arm movement.
@JackPosobiec You‚Äôre ridiculous. She reaches under his left arm to grab the microphone while he was focused on asking the President a question. Anyone would automatically lower their arm. Then he said ‚ÄúPardon me Ma‚Äôam‚Äù in a very polite tone. You guys are demented.
@joshtpm @Acosta @TPM Hey look over here while I openly obstruct Justice.
@CyborgVan @krobinson_3232 @JackPosobiec Don Jr‚Äôs emails (that he released himself) prove it‚Äôs not made up and that Trump‚Äôs campaign wanted the information Russia had. That information was then given to Wikileaks and Trump told people over and over to go view it there. 		So you‚Äôre saying Don Jr released fake emails? https://t.co/YiUJr5Oi9s
@krobinson_3232 @JackPosobiec Reasons matter. We all know Sessions wasn‚Äôt fired because he lied to Congress. Trump hired him to lie. He fired him because he wasn‚Äôt lying enough. 		Sessions was fired because he couldn‚Äôt protect Trump from ‚Äúthis Russia thing‚Äù.
@PressSec @SebGorka Trying hard to distract from Trump‚Äôs active obstruction of Justice. 		This was a setup. 		Trump is breaking the law. https://t.co/3pbPVeVlbm
@SebGorka Right Wing propaganda machine trying desperately to distract from Trump‚Äôs active obstruction of Justice. 		Sessions was fired and replaced with a Trump Stooge in order to try and save Trump and his criminal family.

@JasonDean227 @PrisonPlanet @PressSec What?
@PrisonPlanet @PressSec You guys are ridiculous. He says ‚ÄúPardon me Ma‚Äôam‚Äù very politely as she attempts to take the mic from him.
@Cernovich Republicans: Body slamming a reporter is ok. 		Also Republicans: Lowering your arm and saying ‚ÄúPardon me Ma‚Äôam‚Äù when someone tries to snatch your microphone away is assault.
@SebGorka @Acosta He says ‚Äúpardon me ma‚Äôam‚Äù as she tries to take away his microphone. 		What an animal!
@Cernovich He says ‚ÄúPardon Me Ma‚Äôam‚Äù after she tries to take the mic. 		And you guys are acting like he threw her to the ground. 		You‚Äôre take on this is laughable.
@PrisonPlanet Crisis actors.
@Cernovich She reaches under his arm to grab the mic from his other arm while he is focused on the President. 		Anyone‚Äôs natural reaction would be to lower their arm. 		You are being disingenuous.
