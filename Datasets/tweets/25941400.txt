@Amniot @ewarren I don’t mean that you really shouldn’t vote, but just chill for a while. It’s only February 2019. But again, presidential candidates are people and Elizabeth Warren is doing her best. She cannot appeal to everyone, but I don’t see why she should be criticized so much already.
@Amniot @ewarren If you’re waiting for a candidate to be perfect, to say everything perfectly, then you may as well just not even vote. Presidential candidates are people, they are human. No one candidate is going to be the end all and be all of candidates.

@WaPoSean @pkcapitol Pun intended since everyone refers to McConnell as a turtle? ““Are you suggesting I’m enjoying this?” McConnell snapped back.” The snapping turtle. #MitchMcConnell is the most vile person ever… I cannot stand this man.
@nhruby2 @100_Disable_vet That was absolutely horrific. I was traveling for my job and I remember watching CNN on the airport television, waiting, waiting for news of JFK Junior and Carolyn and her sister, Lauren.
@100_Disable_vet I was 3 1/2 when JFK was assassinated. I was eight when RFK was assassinated. I watch replays of them now and I get chills. Like everyone else, they have their flaws, but they were very passionate about politics and I appreciate that and am sad that they were killed.

@historBilia @RWPUSA Right!!??? Good god.  🌩
@LennyandLizzy @CodingMark @mimilu @TopRopeTravis The death penalty is rough as people are not trained to be executioners and doctors are not trained to kill – &amp; it takes forever for someone to actually receive a lethal injection and that often gets botched. This is why I am against the death penalty. But death penalty for who??

@kylegriffin1 And all this is easy for me to say because I am not in Dr. Ford spot, but with everything going on that is so horrific. I remind myself daily to consider the source. Only horrible people say horrible things. I don’t know Dr. Ford, of course, but she is a wonderful human being.
@kylegriffin1 I wish there was a way I could send Dr. Ford a letter telling her she is amazing and awesome. Such a courageous person. I hope she is able to recover overtime from everything.
Yesterday I stayed away from all news &amp; it was awesome. I completed my third Chicago Marathon. It was hard AF because it was pouring rain, and I started the race with an injury, but dammit, I finished.

@guitr25 @BA_1225BA @mkraju @DanaBashCNN Not really. I am not a senator, but I don’t have children, but I was a child, I was a 15-year-old. I don’t think it’s significant, but that’s just my opinion.
@mkraju @DanaBashCNN You don’t believe he was the one who assaulted her, but you don’t see anything wrong with the way he treated other senators during questioning. You don’t see a problem with the way he treated Harris, Durbin, even Graham said once in the first hearing just answer yes or no.
@KellyannePolls Your #MeToo is #Bullshit

@marcorubio I have to be realistic here Marco, regarding Mitch McConnell, Lindsey Graham, Brett Kavanaugh? They are not being still before the Lord at all. I haven’t seen any of them abandon wrath lately.   Please help them with a refresher course today.
We haven’t heard from Rudy Giuliani for a while... #IMissRudy 😂
@LindseyGrahamSC Oh Lindsey, I don’t think you &amp; I saw the same hearing, even though you were there in person &amp; I was watching on my iPad. How would I feel if I was accused of these things? I would feel absolutely horrible, but lashing out at a US Senator would make me look totally unhinged...
*hearing
@KaarenMann @nowthisnews Dr. Kermit Gosnell should not have been practicing any type of medicine whatsoever. He had an old lawsuit against him that was missed when he renewed his license. There is so much more to this the death of Karnamaya Mognar than what’ve you’ve Tweeted here...
@nowthisnews This is absolutely horrific. Dr. Halappanavaor was miscarrying. 17 weeks is not far enough along for a fetus to survive outside the womb. Miscarriage is a pregnancy that’s ending on its own. The fetus was dying. Dr Halappanavaor died for a dead baby.  Great 😡
@tiniebeany Awesome news!!
I took most of the day off from the news. I do that on Mondays. So, I’m confused about Rachel Mitchell’s report of the Kavanaugh/Ford heading. I thought Mitchell was a ‘female assistant’, you know, like Siri, Her, or Garmin...No???
@stonecold2050 Women should be believed, yes...but @KellyannePolls is hiding so much here, it’s extremely sad. She has a lot to work on because she’s in huge denial. This revelation was very difficult for her. I hope she can at least work on with this for herself and her family.
Exactly https://t.co/9rAo9wgSG5
@KJintheCity @ABC He’s gone off to some other planet. It’s bizarre.
@NBCNews @KellyannePolls Being in denial is harmful to herself and others. Of course the men she listed weren’t her assaulters. We don’t need to know her perp, but as a victim &amp; survivor, she has to do more. She opened a door &amp; then slammed it shut &amp; became argumentative. I hope she talks more later...
@NBCNews @KellyannePolls did herself &amp; women a huge disservice with her brief, emotional revelation about her assault experience. I hope this is just a beginning for her to come clean with herself about what happened. She revealed and then promptly blew it off. I understand. It’s scary.
@smerconish I thought her job was just ask the questions in place of the Republican senators???
@Karoli @kylegriffin1 I do not understand why he was not held in contempt for the way he treated @SenAmyKlobuchar
@kylegriffin1 The defining moment for me regarding Kavanaugh was his exchange with Kamala Harris during his confirmation hearing. This was before Christine Ford. He would not answer Harris’s questions.
Wow! https://t.co/dDdv6o6Wpl
@ABC Wow. Horrendous. Unbelievable.
@kylegriffin1 How could lying not kill the nomination????
@mkraju I’m sad to learn of her assault. She choked up and basically slid in a one liner and then kept talking. I cannot fault her for essentially being in denial.  I feel badly for Kellyanne’s state of affairs. I know she cannot allow herself to be vulnerable on television tho. :-(

@OrrinHatch, you are being a jerk.

The Bill Cosby sentencing should wake up people who don’t think there should be an FBI investigation into Brett Kavanaugh.
@MargeNAvera @LovesHerDanes @LindseyGrahamSC @realDonaldTrump A live boy? Better than a dead one —-
@AP OMG, hahahahaha!
@Erinescence @kaitlancollins @albamonica This is true - I am hailing for the longest gosh darn speech, ever!
@kaitlancollins @albamonica At first I thought the Coke was poured on a seat! As much as I detest Trump, I don’t care that he prefers Diet Coke.
@KNIPTX @PhilipRucker @lrozen @Gabriel_Pogrund @JoeNBC @CNNPolitics @MSNBC @JoyceWhiteVance @tedlieu @AP @thehill So much longer than a mini-series, but yes, we cannot make this stuff up!
@WetLipHamilton @kylegriffin1 I agree, but I also realize I am being subjective.
@cosmicfirepeace @morgfair @VegSyl @MichaelAvenatti @GOP But turning down the music? I think you or whomever meant ‘turning up the music”
@jdprx15 @fred_guttenberg Oh, ok, thanks. So much is lost in Tweets and texts.
@jdprx15 @fred_guttenberg I am not pro gun, but the meds post is too general. People can take these meds and own a gun. Depends on each person’s history and why they’re taking a particular medication. I don’t own a gun and don’t want to own a gun, but took Effexor for headaches years ago.
@SarahKSilverman WTF?
@ActivistCat @BeeArt27 https://t.co/9MfSRQFKgE
@fred_guttenberg I don’t give her the time of day…
@KFILE Viewing this made me feel very uncomfortable
@samstein Oh, come on...
@JRubinBlogger It was just a broken record anyway...
@missykender @DogginTrump But, how was your day??? 🤪🤪
@DogginTrump Um 😐...
@MeghanMcCain Wow. Already. 😢
On a completely different topic, I’m getting ready to run the Chicago Marathon on October 7! https://t.co/egwTy5ruPm
@Kevin_Garnett58 @michelleisawolf And John Wayne Gacy dressed up as a clown and visited kids in the hospital. I’m not saying I think BK is a serial killer, but we never really know some people...
@Adhere2Truth @michelleisawolf Horrifying. I’m so sorry.
@michelleisawolf Yep.
@Eugene_Robinson It’s the full moon tho...
@Eugene_Robinson Kavanaugh, Rosenstein, and Cosby! Gah.
@diane3strikes @Mikel_Jollett @kaitlancollins Yep. Asshats.
@kaitlancollins Great way to deflect from Kavanaugh.
@kaitlancollins Noooo
@NBCNews @JuliaEAinsley 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
@DrPaulGosar Hahaahahah. You really look like a shit now, buddy.
Putting your hand over a girl’s mouth and turning up the radio so she can’t be heard are calculated moves, not teen indiscretions. https://t.co/C2qee7eF9n
The #Kavanaugh nomination is too much work, too much controversy. I feel he performed very poorly at his confirmation hearings, way before #DrBlaseyFord and #DeborahRamirez. Pull Kavanaugh, nominate someone else, FBI investigate Kavanaugh now.
Yes, thank you, @SenatorLeahy! You are the best. https://t.co/of1RfQvTWW
@DeanObeidallah Pure evil
RT @DanRather: I know there are a lot of special "days" but tomorrow is National Voter Registration Day and I think that's something we can…
@JeanneMillerPV @Acosta Nah. These are my words, but basically Trump is going to say that Kavanaugh was given a bad deal by the women....
@Acosta And this is when you know somebody is bad news!
@BagodonutzJoey @AnnCoulter The scary part is that you have Trump’s photo for your profile picture.
@AnnCoulter I cannot stand you, but I like your last sentence. You’re not going to vote Republican if Mitch doesn’t do what you want him to do. What are you going to do on election day then? This is the first time you’ve said something relevant – one measly sentence at the end of your tweet.
@marcorubio For there is nothing hidden that will become visible...
@fred_guttenberg It’s a great idea, but it’s not going to happen.
@KirstenPowers Decades of the #MeToo movement???? As we know, it’s always an excuse with the GOP. They are the most paranoid people out there…
@elice_elise @TheOnion 😆😆😆
@JRubinBlogger Remember— “I actually really like Sarah. I think she’s very resourceful. She burns facts and then she uses that ash to create a perfect smoky eye. Like maybe she’s born with it, maybe it’s lies. It’s probably lies.” @michelleisawolf

@MichaelAvenatti Michael, unfortunately this is not one of your better Tweets. Try again, ok. I’m your fan, but this Tweet kinda sucks. Sorry 😐!
@DCSharon @DrLindaTribuzio @PreetBharara 🤣🤣🤣
@NatashaBertrand Now we know why McConnell was so rabid and why Graham and Grassley kept touting and touting, etc. So effing shady.
@DrLindaTribuzio @PreetBharara This was my Tweet: “Can’t even think about going to sleep at a decent time on a Sunday night, not since the inauguration of Trump. Now his SCOTUS nominee continues to blow up the news. Also wonder if Brett had any regret...”

@hlb54 @jdawsey1 Instead of ‘unforgettable’, it’s ‘unendorseable’. Should try a new song.
@renato_mariotti @DouxDux Ah. My sad texting.  😂
@hlb54 @jdawsey1 Thank you ☺️
@renato_mariotti @DouxDux I know, right? I laughed the other night when I pulled out a 2013 calendar whe. I was on the phone with a friend. He had asked me a question about my business - so I just went to a cabin and said, well in 2013. I felt strange, 2013 at my fingertips? No 1986 tho...
@krassenstein @gjlos24 @MichaelAvenatti Withdraw is such an ironic word —- sorry.
@JbissellF @washingtonpost I recommend it...
@Hutchinson17Tim @samstein Omg 😆
@samstein 🤣
Can’t even think about going to sleep at a decent time on a Sunday night, not since the inauguration of Trump. Now his SCOTUS nominee continues to blow up the news. Also wonder if Brett had any regret...
@JbissellF @washingtonpost Have you seen White Boy Rick movie?
@jdw4092 @washingtonpost Kidnapping and strangling????? 4 minutes of strangulation kills.
@washingtonpost OMFG - they’re going to wait for him to kill someone????

@AstorAaron @jdawsey1 Oh, but she’s awful too. Gah.
@jdawsey1 @hlb54 WH theme these days is to endorse the unendorseable - yes, new word, unendorseable. They dig their heels in even more when the going gets tougher...
@KirstenPowers @RonanFarrow @JaneMayerNYer @KirstenPowers, I think we should chill for now — let’s focus on what’s happening in the news. I don’t mean to sound like I’m dismissing your feelings...
@shannonrwatts @JenniferWexton White! But I hope you had rain boots today instead - the Converse part is good. 😁
RT @Mimirocah1: And now we know why Republicans cared so much about Monday vs. Thursday for a hearing date.

BREAKING: Another allegation against Kavanaugh, from his first year at Yale. Developing story.
@fred_guttenberg @CNN I spelled Knoblach wrong. Apologies.
@fred_guttenberg @CNN I’ve read up more on Laura Knobach and her parents are unbelievable. Laura has done great things with her life and she’s only 22.
