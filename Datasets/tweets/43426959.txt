@mattrob74779817 @RepAdamSchiff @AOC Well you're in luck! The southern border is already protected, and immigration is already regulated.

@RealJohhnieDoe @GovMikeHuckabee Oh ffs. It's a comedy segment. Only a real dolt could miss that.
@jhamilton1024 @GovMikeHuckabee I don't think he knows how. Have you seen the stuff he posts thinking he's funny?
@Ultim8Aggie @GovMikeHuckabee She does comedy segments. Take a xanax. Also: abysmal*
@dennisw59 @GovMikeHuckabee After a fashion, yes. This is a comedy segment from CNN. Jenny Moos only reports on things that are silly or amusing.
@GovMikeHuckabee You're inability to understand the humor in a comedy segment explains a little of why your ass kiss "jokes" you post to curry favor with trump are so utterly unfunny.
@AnnCoulter I have an irrational hope that you're just pretending to be such a venomous harpy.
@Alex_L_Benson @francismmaxwell @clarkewolfe Right, but the fence/wall/slats is just one idea, not the whole of border security. Much like background checks are but one facet of gun control. The wall just happens to be a demonstrably foolish way of spending border security funds.

@Luke_21_20 @GovMikeHuckabee They still do consulting with current administrations to continue sharing their expertise. That's nothing new. Revoking clearances in a pique of butthurt is what's new.
@GovMikeHuckabee Don't be obtuse. It's because the security clearance was revoked in petty retaliation over Trump's bruised ego. Had nothing to do with security.
