When Desirae's mother told the boys that both of their parents were dead, the older boy knew almost instinctively that their father hurt their mother: ‚ÄúThe oldest one looked up and said, ‚ÄòDaddy shot mama, didn‚Äôt he?‚Äô And I said, ‚ÄòYes, baby, he did.‚Äô ‚Äù
Days later, that is exactly what he did. He shot Desirae in the head and then killed himself. Desirae's mother is now raising their two sons, now 9 and 7.
‚ÄúHe told her, ‚ÄòIf you get a VPO, I will kill you, and I will kill myself,‚Äô ‚Äù Desirae's mother said. ‚ÄúWe just thought he was blowing air, like he always did.‚Äù
Restraining orders are also known as victim protective orders, or VPOs.
Also take the case of Desirae Parnell. She told the father of her two children she planned to file a restraining order against him, according to her mother.
‚ÄúAnd she did,‚Äù he said of Jackson. ‚ÄúAnd she‚Äôs dead.‚Äù
‚ÄúThat‚Äôs what people think they are supposed to do when they feel as though they are threatened or they are in danger. We tell them, ‚ÄòGet an order of protection,‚Äô ‚Äù said Travis Partney, chief trial attorney in the St. Louis circuit attorney‚Äôs office.
The restraining order lay on a microwave nearby. When the police asked if Jackson had trouble with anyone, her brother handed them the document.
Eleven days later, Jackson was dead. Authorities said her ex shot her four times through her bedroom window.
A judge issued a year-old restraining order on Aug. 2, 2017. The ex was ordered to have no contact and stay 2,500 feet away from Jackson.
Take the case of Ciera Jackson in St. Louis. She filed a restraining order, claiming in docs that her ex-boyfriend sent threatening texts and lurked outside her home.
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not a bulletproof vest,‚Äù said Karen Parker, president and CEO of Safe Alliance, which helps abused women in Charlotte. ‚ÄúHe can still come after you. It‚Äôs a legal tool.‚Äù
Legally, there‚Äôs not much that can happen until the order is violated. It‚Äôs up to the alleged abuser to comply with the order. One prosecutor tells a woman to file an order with a backpack and a plan. The onus is on the woman to move,  pull her kids out of school, etc
The most basic step domestic violence victims are told to do is to file a restraining order. But instead of keeping women safe, it can become a flash point that leads to fatal violence. https://t.co/va0wUIcydd

Nearly half of women killed in major cities over the past decade were murdered by an intimate partner. A deep dive into five cities shows 38 percent were known to be a potential threat ahead of the attack. How domestic violence leads to murder: https://t.co/QnpCZekBSZ
The case underscores the complexity of domestic abuse, how women are terrified that reporting abuse could cause them to lose their children and fact that many care for the man who is abusing them. Prosecutors think, in hindsight, Cisneros‚Äôs case as having been avoidable.
A little more than a year later, Cisneros was dead. Authorities said her abuser shot her once in the chest on Christmas morning 2015. The child she was pregnant with when she went to the hospital was sleeping beside her.
Months, later the case was reassigned. The common-law husband was taken into custody and Cisneros visited the DA‚Äôs office. She was adamant she was safe and wanted the case against him dismissed. A grand jury listened and didn‚Äôt indict him.
The hospital contacted authorities, but the case stalled. Child protective services opened an inquiry into Cisneros, alleging she failed to protect her two older children from witnessing the abuse she suffered. She took a class on how to manage her husband‚Äôs violent behavior.
Cisneros arrived at a Fort Worth hospital with a bloody nose, busted lip, strangulation marks on her neck and blood in her eyes. Her common-law husband allegedly tried to strangle her into unconsciousness. She was eight months pregnant.
Domestic violence cases are extremely complex. Women do not want to report their abuser for many reasons, including love, financial support and, in the case of Minerva Cisneros, fear that her children would be taken from her. Thread:  https://t.co/QnpCZekBSZ

@Gregc_847 Yes that‚Äôs in the story. Know it‚Äôs long but please read through!
Family justice centers around the country have consolidated services, making it easier for victims to access help
The good news is that law enforcement across the country is moving to intervene early in domestic violence cases. Police are connecting victims with help at the scene. Prosecutors are reviewing fatal cases to see where the system went wrong.
These are some of the most complex cases because often women don‚Äôt want to report for many reasons: angering her abuser, losing her financial support and because she loves him.
These are murders that play out in slow motion as the cycle of violence escalates. And the burden is on the abused to get help.
Many of these killers have displayed violent tendencies before; a close analysis of five cities shows that more than a third of the killers were known to be a potential threat before the attack.
Few people want to talk about domestic violence. But it often leads to brutal murder. Nearly half the women killed in 47 cities over the past decade were murdered by an intimate partner, my colleagues and I found.  https://t.co/IbqfexfkgW
