They don't want  others to know what they are doing to get ride of innocent people that's why they shut all  the doors, all the chances ,all the opportunities that's make this people service .
Iranian people yelling and screaming for help,for justice,for freedom .	The government used the authority to shut them down ,instead of protected them ,they abused the power that's has to be the best way to protect people .
@realDonaldTrump They  try to shut them down before no one know there  safrance ,or hear there voice ,that's sad when they try  to take other people lives without sympathy.
@realDonaldTrump Sorry I mean ,I wish no body have to go through this horrible situation .
@realDonaldTrump They are hungry for freedom, freedom, freedom ,I wish no one have to thorough what you his people go through ,no freedom ,no life  ,no freedom ,no human Rights.
@realDonaldTrump here in america ,no one is angry when they get criticize, why,because they use to hear other opinions,respect it ,even if they like it or not ,but still respect it,god bless this country.
@realDonaldTrump That's true ,that's why I love America , i am a Muslim women  who really appreciated to be american ,here in america a person can express this feeling without fear to be targeted, a real countries like america let's people exercise there right ,free of speech, and accepted .
@Zebasez @saba_ummreem When I see what happened in the world ,I just can't blame them  not accepted us easily in there society .	 But keep hope for future to bring us all together ,all people from all race, religion ,culture ,to love each others ,help each others .
@Zebasez @saba_ummreem Now people resent Islam ,not because of Islam ,Islam is a religion of piece ,but because of the behavior of bad Muslims .	They lost trust on Muslims ,I can't blame them ,I put myself on there place,and I understand how it is very hard for them to see the difference.
