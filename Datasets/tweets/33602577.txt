Who told the Angels to keep trying? 2 run homerun off Michael Johnson, who is a human pitcherman. 1 out in the 9th, 13-9 Dodgers.

The future is really on display in this inning. Back to back to back taters, a Keibert Ruiz walk, and a nice single by Edwin Rios.		The pitcher has been chased! 10-7 Dodgers.		I can get used to this!
DJ Peters with the annihilation of another baseball! Second HR on the day, homerun 3 in a row! 		@russellmartin55 must be proud! #4plus1
BACK-2-BACK JACKS! Future friend of the show Matt Beaty goes yard! 9-7 for Los Dongers!

May threw a good amount of pitches (24) but got around a one-out walk successfully. Still tied at 7-7 and heading to the bottom of the 7th.		Time to stretch! Hit it, @DieterRuehle!

The Dodgers finally get out of it. Starting to run out of big leaguers on the field, but still up 5-4 and onto the 4th.
@4michelgonzalez Word is that his name is Parker Curry. No relation to Steph.
After the pitching change, bad things happen and the score is now 5-4 LAD. Bases loaded triple, 1 out.

@srmgonzalez3 agreed . . . . so what do other teams *Dodgers* really have to offer to get Bryce?
Fan Theories: Padres really signed Manny for 5 years, expecting to trade him before he opts out, so they can:		- Raise ticket prices	- Show fans they're trying to win with their amazing farm system	- Get more prospects from Yankees when they trade Manny there.
@NOLA_Fredo I'd put $300,000,000.01 #MoneysMoney

Cody Bellinger ranks VERY high on @MLBNetwork Top 10 CF's right now, and another #Dodgers player makes the list! What do you think about Bellinger's ranking?
