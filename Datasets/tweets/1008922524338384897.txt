@marklevinshow You know, I love the game.  It's been politicized.  I get it, the players wanting to make a statement, raise awareness.  And I encourage that, support that.  Just not when on the field.  The player is an employee of the franchise.  The franchise should establish a code of coduct.

@FoxNews You know the story is a crooked "pro tem" Mayor gets caught, but there is never a mention of those persons/businesses that bought the influence.  Aren't those businesses and influencers guilty of a crime as well, or just the elected guy with a weak moral character?
@FoxNews Is it "fate" that will exercise her will?  It's down to three choices that I can foresee.  		1.  Total denuclearization 		2.  Acceptance to the Nuke club		3. Total annihilation of DPRK		The 3rd option should send shivers down the spine.  Not 10k, 100k, but MILLIONS WILL PERISH
