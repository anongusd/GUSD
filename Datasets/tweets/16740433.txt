@DoctorStebick @willsommer Umm. What’s ironic is you liberals STILL not getting that we conservatives are not homophobic and have done nothing to threaten gay rights. You so know Brandon Straka was a beloved headliner at our event right? And that we adore Ricky Rebel, Andre Soriano and so on and so on?🙄
@DoctorStebick @willsommer Hey what’s wrong with having some fun and not taking it so seriously? 😝Clearly no sense of humor if you can’t enjoy Its Raining Men blasting at a celebration of men

What unearned male privilege? Like the fact that men make up 94% of Job-related deaths? Or that men make up 80% of Suicide victims? Or that Women make up 57% of college graduates? Or that men have to put “women &amp; children first?” Or the gynocentric marriage &amp; family court system? https://t.co/V02Srw8dYm

Look at all the dozens of pple here backing me up &amp; calling you and her out for the vile &amp; soul-less "nasty women" that you are. 	You just reaffirm why a growing number of women are rejecting feminism
Or I guess asking someone for an interview now is called 'cat-calling?' Next thing I know she &amp; other feminists will be slapping anyone that asks them any questions w/ a sexual harassment lawsuit? Since they change the definition every day. Scary. #feminist #MakeSanityGreatAgain
@TobysArtCrime @PaperFoxx @Oneiorosgrip @LeahNTorres @Sugar_Tits_Bear @girlwriteswhat Seriously! Isn’t that the whole point of a freakin interview? To TALK. Ask questions. Share our opinions. How is that ‘trapping’ her? 🤦🏽‍♀️
@blckriflecoffee Sent you a DM about the Men's Rally:)
@ChristieLea @Oneiorosgrip @PaperFoxx @TobysArtCrime @LeahNTorres @Sugar_Tits_Bear @girlwriteswhat Um... huh? I’ve been here responding the whole time. If I’m quiet its bc Im in utter shock over how vile &amp; disassociated from ur soul u are
@occasionatheist @mav254 @LeahNTorres Um... huh? How is she smarter than me?
@LeahNTorres @Oneiorosgrip @BlueEASM @PaperFoxx @TobysArtCrime @Sugar_Tits_Bear @girlwriteswhat I’m not the one who ended conversation my dear, you did. I’m still here and have been here. You said “I can’t be bothered with anyone who..”
@LeahNTorres Not trying to ‘trap’ u. Im simply askng u some questions to build rapport. havent even stated any of my own views. U havent answered anythng
@TobysArtCrime @Oneiorosgrip @LeahNTorres @Sugar_Tits_Bear @girlwriteswhat Bottom line: she doesn’t want to talk to or do interviews w/ anyone who has differing views. Hence why feminists stay in their echo chambers
@LeahNTorres @TobysArtCrime How exactly was Toby exhibiting misogyny ? I must be missing something, am combing through his words &amp; I am not seeing anything misogynistic
@LeahNTorres Do you believe there are only 2 genders; male &amp; female? Again, would’ve preferred to have this spirited conversation outside of text
@LeahNTorres Wow, u must know everything, huh. What if I see areas of relevancy that U don’t? And all of this would be better discussed in a conversation
@LeahNTorres You asked me to be more specific about what topics I wanted to discuss, so I was trying to be specific per ur request. Plus God is relevant
@LeahNTorres Also, do you believe in God?
Wow... just wow.
Ok, fair enough. Lets start w/ a few simple questions... 1) When u say you're a 'Nasty Woman,' what does that mean to u? 2) Do u believe the new Reproductive Health Act is really a 'victory for women? Do u think passing it country-wide would be good for our country? why/why not? https://t.co/k6A66uyUq5

The backwards values of liberals are proof of masterful Social Engineering at its finest: “Never again will u be capable of ordinary human feeling. Everythng will be dead inside u. You will be hollow. We shall squeeze u empty, and then we shall fill u with ourselves.” ~Orwell1984
So #Democrats call it "immoral" to have a wall &amp; greater protections of our border in order to keep American citizens safe, yet they call it a "victory" to kill their own child. How disassociated from your heart &amp; soul must u be to celebrate &amp; cheer for this dehumanizing law?

They take their opportunities, given to them by men in the name of "gender parity &amp; female equality in the workplace", then return the favor by discriminating against men, demonizing men &amp; perverting masculinity. Toxic Feminism will ultimately set women back decades. Sad &amp; stupid
Its sad to say, but with constant misandristic stunts like these (#Gillette), Feminists are proving every day that women don't belong in Leadership positions. They should not have control or leadership over companies w/ men in them or that serve a male demographic. https://t.co/1vrWeQgOiu
@teichroeb_jacob @rxisedbywxlves @brandanatweets @Gillette So what about Toxic Femininity &amp; Toxic Feminism? Those are very real things too that need to be addressed if we’re addressing the male side

Isnt being "great friends" who share decades of experiences together, the beauty of a great marriage for life? No one else can compare to those memories. Our culture no longer teaches that marriage may not always be hot &amp; passionate but being best friends is what is really about
After 25 yrs of marriage, Jeff #Bezos &amp; his wife decide to get a divorce. They claim they are still great friends who love each other. I wonder, after that many yrs &amp; being in their 50s, will their lives really be better after a divorce then if staying married? #realtalk

Anyone who believes that gender is binary, or who stands up for God's intention or even for basic truth or common sense now gets vilified or ostracized from society. Plus... Forcing Gender-neutral ideology on young children is child abuse plain &amp; simple!
Wow--&gt; https://t.co/jCpmpQegOX Let's just call a spade a spade here: This isn't about 'inclusiveness' for the LGBTQ community. This isn't about genuine care &amp; concern for them. All this is merely a continuation of the leftist agenda to dismantle traditional marriage &amp; families.

@AmanirenaK @SenBlumenthal regardless, with all the points of evidence that’s been discussed so far, I believe Kavanaugh over her and he is more credible

@AmyKremer Hi Amy! I sent u a Facebook message &amp; email. Would love to talk w/ you about potentialy speaking at or attending your Women for Trump summit Oct. 6. Our beliefs are very much aligned &amp; I can offer a unique perspective. Got a lot to say on these matters! Can we connect?
@DebraMessing Why? Why should we blindly believe someone's allegations? And why not blindly believe the men who are being accused who deny the allegation? I’ll wait for an answer. Is it solely bc she’s a woman? Meaning women are somehow inherently honest &amp; men aren’t? Pls answer
If women truly believe that all men are rotten predators, liars &amp; potential rapists, why dont they just all move to an island w all-women? 	Oh I know, bc if they needed their TV fixed, or garbage picked up, or need love or sex or a baby, they would sudenly "need" men🙄	#ILoveMen

@Jenojen @CultrCnnundrm It 👏🏼 doesn’t 👏🏼 require 👏🏼 an 👏🏼 FBI 👏🏼 investigation. What do u not get about that?! It’s not even eligible for FBI! Lol. Know the facts
@Jenojen @CultrCnnundrm 6) His mother Martha ruled against Dr. Blasey’s parents in a foreclosure case in 1996 7) Dems had this info for 2 months &amp; waited till after all the hearings to drop it 8) She never contacted him or filed a charge in 36 yrs. Extremely suspicious [and too many other facts to list
@Jenojen @CultrCnnundrm 3.Any supposed witness have denied 4. She's an avid leftist activist &amp; Trump-hater who has been active in blocking him on his policies 5) He has a pristine record for his entire life &amp; already been vetted 6x by FBI before this &amp; they never found a thing
@Jenojen @CultrCnnundrm 1)It was 36 yrs ago, @ a High school party, &amp; she can't remember much. 2) Her stories have changed already several times, &amp; have conflicting details. If she has been testifying in court, she would be finished already bc of these conflicting details that would not hold up in court
And what is this vile, amoral behavior teaching our kids, this next generation of youth who see all of this every day on Internet &amp; MSM? 😡
Have we lost all sense of decency when we have porn stars openly talking about our President's penis shape on national TV? Or when pple can destroy someone's career &amp; life based on an allegation w/o having any facts? What happened to good will, integrity, decency? #JusticeforToad
@Jenojen @CultrCnnundrm Given all the facts that have been laid out, I stand with Kavanaugh &amp; he is more credible than her. But, we shall see and I remain open
@DariaDariaI5757 @CNN @CNNnewsroom Highly doubt it, but if he does then then I’ll admit it. But, I still don’t think 1 incident in high school warrants not confirming him
@DariaDariaI5757 @CNN You shouldn’t “believe” women blindly unless all the facts are laid out. You also shouldn’t “believe” a man is guilty until proven innocent
Yes folks. Stay tuned for a wayyy better version of 'The View'... 	"The BETTER View!" Whoopie and the gang can't hold a candle to us gals :) https://t.co/UIWGlqH0VL
@Jenojen I wont stop bc its causing huge problems, perhaps irreversibly, w gender relations, the family unit &amp; the country. Womn will lose in the end
And this is why I wont ever call mself a "Feminist." I hav women saying I need to 'turn in my woman card' &amp; "stand down," bc I bring up facts. So much for 'women empowerment.' And, what we really dont need are women like U who attack &amp; imply doubt on a man based on an allegation! https://t.co/AaNbPXz7iK

@vansmaq It wasn't sexist at all. Its simply their fixation on being a permanent outraged victim.
@devbost Hmm, "you're sexist;" "You're racist," false sexual assault allegation; "You should be ashamed!" All of the leftist tactics from their playbook. 😂 You're cute:)
@vansmaq Omg. That is horrendous! I’m sure there are many other stories like this. Thank I for sharing. We need more men like u to share
@vansmaq Wow, Im so sorry to hear that. Men or women should be promoted based on MERIT! Any other stories? These r great for my podcast &amp; next book!
@devbost You say that now untill ONE woman decides to be vindictive toward you &amp; throw out a false sexual harassment allegation. Then game over.
@DonnaWR8 @NewRightNetwork @Education4Libs @DonaldJTrumpJr Donna, just watch the opening monologue! It’s CRINGE. They bash Jesus, white pple, conservatives &amp; Christians within first 90 seconds 😡
Yep. It’s classic Divide-and-conquer 🙄
@AnarchistPunkDa Well Let’s separate “normal sane women” from feminists. There IS a difference:)
A msg to young women &amp; girls: Be a free thinkng woman-Dont be a sheep; Ditch harmful feminist principles; You can be both powerful AND feminine; Dont fight men &amp; view them as your enemy, Love &amp; appreciate men! You dont need to engage in the liberal 'slut culture.'#FamilyFaithLove
Yes, real victims of sexual assault will suffer the most from this in the end because the liberals who cannot separate and call incidents like these out for what they are - hit pieces - turn the whole movement into a joke with no credibility. Its very short-sighted and it’s sad. https://t.co/4Hmf7QIb3u
@JallehDoty Yes! Thank you for being a a sane and normal, feminine woman!

I'm of course against genuine sexual assault. But whats happening is more sinister: The left has been Weaponizing Women for political gain &amp; to subordinate &amp; destroy men. This will have dire consequences: Men no longer hiring women; men staying far, far away from women. Worth it?

Also: Rather than use his fame to create division &amp; raise awareness about 2 issues that cannot be measured or solved, why not focus on issues that can actualy b measured &amp; solved?

@DaDrumpf Aw poor thing. U still think we actualy care about being called names. We don't. We also don't care who Q is; its irrelevant. We care about the information he asks us to research. Almost all has been proven true &amp; its open-source, u can easily research it. Ur too brainwashed tho.
@DaDrumpf Says the guy who believes Trump is a white nationalist and a racist. You clearly don’t operate in facts or truth 😂😂
@DaDrumpf Where are your sources and facts?
@DaDrumpf Pizzagate refers to the pervasive global child trafficking rings &amp; involvement of high-level government officials &amp; authorities. So we agree
And Liberals still think #pizzagate and the epidemic of child sex trafficking is all just a "conspiracy theory?" And that Qanon is all just fake news? How many more coincidences till it becomes mathematically impossible to deny? Wake UP sheeple. #Qanon #GreatAwakening https://t.co/X8Ax5I35nJ

Happy #PurpleHeartDay. So grateful for all our heroes in our great military who have defended our freedom &amp; were wounded or killed. They are the bravest, yet most unappreciated Americans. It takes a special person to risk so much for pple who care so little. Thank you #veterans!
@TFMonkeyYouTube @Antiwhiteknight @SandmanMGTOW Or was it specifically his Misandry Today show that I was on which is different that TFM
@TFMonkeyYouTube @Antiwhiteknight @SandmanMGTOW Isn’t DDJ, aka Bob Lewis of The Feminist Lie, Co-Host of the Turd Flinging Monkey show? That’s who I did the interview with last month
@KingNatalieking @KCSportsNerd @WellFrankIy It’s ridiculous. And what about all the YT videos promoting pedophilia &amp; man-hating, white-hating etc. But of course those can stay.
@Antiwhiteknight @TFMonkeyYouTube @SandmanMGTOW I already have! I have another one with TFM in next few weeks.
@JallehDoty Yes! See...many good-hearted women out there who do NOT align w these insane feminist views. They pretend to speak for all women but do not
Thank you, she is quoted &amp; sourced in my book actually! Great woman. The tide is already starting to turn, can’t you see? Ppl getting fed up
You can choose to have zero faith, and thats a depressing life.

@KCSportsNerd I’m not saying I “claim” Alex. But every america should be against censorship of free speech, even if it’s wacky
The reason why its dangerous is bc its a slippery slope, one that we've seen many times before. If they successfully write off Alex as "hate speech" &amp; fake news, then all other Conservative-leaning public figures or patriots can/will be taken down as well as they've already done

@kathygriffin @thescranline Kathy, I voted for Trump &amp; I would do it again &amp; again. I do not vote for evil, soulless, anti-American beings. Why I didn’t vote for Her
@Hornswoggler55 Yes its a show on TV, n @TLC . The finale is on right now...
Great Q! I would ask her: 1) Are u a #Feminist. Did u vote for Hillary. Yes? Check please;) 2) What r your parents &amp; grandparents relationships like? Do u hav faith in God? What do u think about #MeToo? What do u think about gender roles? What r ur goals? https://t.co/VCuwJdoNO0
My thoughts on #90DayFiance : If ur man consistently chooses ur family over u &amp; never defends u or protects u, he's not a good man. If ur man would rather lie to u or hide things from u instead of clearly communicate issues, it wont be a healthy marriage. Need to think long-term!
I thnk these men on #LostInTransition are very selfish. They knew they had gender dysphoria, &amp; stil married women &amp; created families w/ them. Then 20 yrs later they tell them they want to start transitioning to a woman? &amp; just expect their wives 2 be ok w/ that &amp; become lesbians?

@mrsfdt @JHohen11 @TonyRobbins @eugeneshin Whats really hilarious though is that literally every time these women speak, they prove Tony Robbin's original point. Its rich!
@mrsfdt @JHohen11 @TonyRobbins @eugeneshin these women are sick. Like really sick, broken, need help. No use arguing or communicating with them. Just pray they heal.
"Put on the full armor of God, so that u will be able to stand firm against the schemes of the devil. For our struggle is not against flesh &amp; blood, but against the world forces of this darkness, the spiritual forces of wickedness in high places." &lt;3 Fitting right now.
The #GenderPayGap has been proven to be a lie. Its not based on "Sexism," its based on diff CHOICES that men &amp; womn make in their lives. FACTS: Men tend 2 choose careers that are more risky, less comfortable, less flexible, &amp; work more hours on average than women do. #EqualPayDay https://t.co/sNyEVyu6ln
@mrsfdt Again... I pray for you sweetie.
@mrsfdt Who said I’m single and who said Im 40? Get your facts straight. I pray for you that you can release all that hate &amp; anger in your heart. 🙏🏽
Wow. Look what this woman said to me on @TonyRobbins page. All bc I illustrated some potential negative impacts of #MeToo The true vile &amp; soulless colors of Libs come spewing out when anyone is not in 100% in agreement with them. #Disgusting. https://t.co/P4lvcrXeUo
@JHohen11 @TonyRobbins @TheKenWilber You didn’t answer my question. I guess I can presume your answer based on this though
@JHohen11 @TonyRobbins @TheKenWilber Curious, do you think tearing down the career of Tony Will help you become one step closer to what it is you all are trying to achieve?
@JHohen11 @TonyRobbins @TheKenWilber Once again, You continue to prove our point. Thank you. Case closed.
@JHohen11 @TonyRobbins @TheKenWilber Also, thank you for proving me, and Tony’s point perfectly. Case closed.
@JHohen11 @TonyRobbins @TheKenWilber You are an absolutely despicable, soul-less, disgusting excuse for a woman. You are sick sick sick.
@Classy_Shopper So based on your logic, Hillary should have also been raided by FBI and removed from office then?
@Classy_Shopper Having consensual sex (allegedly) with a porn star 1 time over 12 yrs ago does not warrant an FBI raid. Nor is this “doing their job.”
FBI is officially a joke. Doesnt investigate after being called 39x for school shooting threats, doesn’t raid Hillary or DNC... but Stormy?!
@MarieBanks1976 @4lb_brain @jeneology_ @TonyRobbins @TheKenWilber Right... coming from someone who has an “Equal pay” sign onher twitter. The “gender pay gap” has been proven to be a myth.
@4lb_brain @OptionsAreGood @TonyRobbins @TheKenWilber Both of those movements have also devolved into radical hate and have created even more division. Just look at this country now.

@BeautyBind NO, thats exctly ur problem. They dont "need" to do any more things. Your constant bashing of the "Good men" &amp; then demands on them, are turning them off &amp; alienating them. Plus, in the same breath, feminists say they "DON'T need" men; Women need men like a fish needs a bicycle?!

Yep. I defended @TonyRobbins for what he said about #MeToo at his Seminar. And it started a twitter Firestorm among feminists &amp; libs! Find out my full thoughts on this &amp; more on my live show, TOMOROW/Monday morn @ 9:30am-10:30a PST on @NewRightNetwork https://t.co/UbLlALAqtN
@BeautyBind Of course good men want to respect boundaries. But The "Good" Men hav already gotten the msg, loud &amp; clear, &amp; dont need it hammered into them every day. Now many of them fear even talking 2 women or basic flirting, bc they dont want to risk anythng. The Male-Bashing needs to go.

And Mexico has 1500+ people &amp; "carvans" trying to walk right through our boarders and claim amnesty, yet say that we're "Racist" or lacking compassion if we don't just let them in?! Very ironic. America should take a page from Mexico's strict border control!
@TuckerCarlson Would love to tell this story on your show!
Hey Lefties, what happened to “when they go low, we go high”? Or something like that. 🤮 https://t.co/ETxNdVej2n
Thank you, for thinking for your SELF &amp; loving this country enough to support @realDonaldTrump https://t.co/fkpoYUvEDf
@Frances_Fisher @TonyRobbins @TheKenWilber ONCE again, he never “shamed” women for speaking out.
@Christie_Whelan @jsconroy @TonyRobbins @TheKenWilber Bc there isn’t anything to “fight” over. I’m sorry, what rights do women not have in the US that men have?
@Luca4000 @ObliviousBecky You are so awesome! 🙌🏽 love how This crazy chick is trying to call you names thinking that’s going really sway you Lol
@Luca4000 @TonyRobbins @FeedingAmerica Luca, ‘this stream is absolutely sick. Just look at all the vile comments

@SupersizeCombo Nope, I applaud Mexico! Im saying US should take note and also tighten its borders and security. It’s not “racism,” it’s called “security”
@redstarburst44 @jsconroy @TonyRobbins @TheKenWilber You guys NeVER learn. There is no being “out-debated” just bc you all hurl insults and vile names at me. I won’t “sit down.”
Exactly. The hypocrisy meter, as usual with Libs, is so high from this its exploding. Or what about Bill Clinton or Hillary? https://t.co/DFHDxfPGfD
@KarenRock5 @TonyRobbins @TheKenWilber Yeah, lots of empathy u  all have. By name -calling, threatening and bullying those who want to offer a different perspective.
@leanne_cali @TonyRobbins @TheKenWilber Lol, That’s all you leftists have. Threats &amp; bullying. When are u nuts gonna realize they DONT work! Threaten me all u want. Good luck 😂
@WomensMarchCDA @TonyRobbins @TheKenWilber My stance on this is just fine, thank you. But again, You demand everyone “listen” to you, But you cannot hear any other perspective.
@NelsonStJames1 @TonyRobbins @FeedingAmerica No, bc then hed be INAUTHENTIC &amp; lying! Pple spend thousands of $ to hear the truth &amp; grow frm him, not be lied to to “spare their feelings”
@JamesDo22 @TonyRobbins @FeedingAmerica Or unless he’s speaking the TRUTH. He is risking his career by trying to help women grow instead of pandering to them to make more 💸, genius
@Luca4000 @PattyHarbison @TonyRobbins @FeedingAmerica Yes! Thank you for having the “balls” to back To ny because he and you are so right. All these women tearing him down are shameful.
* “worn,” not “torn.” Just some bent pages!
Hm, IRONIC: Was about 2 fly to Cabo tonite &amp; as Im checkng in, They said they couldnt let me into Mexico because my passport was a bit "too worn," &amp; evidently MEX is one of the strictest countries with passports/visas; It needs 2 look good, otherwise they send u bak.#caravans?🤔
@Rhiannon_K_82 @lgmaterna @TonyRobbins @TheKenWilber The true vile colors of liberals come spewing out when one tries to offer them a different perspective🤮 “Womens empowerment” my ass
@bfoster204 @TonyRobbins @TheKenWilber Right... Keep spitting out the same CNN talking points they spoon-feed you. Since you cant think for yourself. "Useful Idiots" are what Marxists call you.
@lgmaterna @Rhiannon_K_82 @TonyRobbins @TheKenWilber If Feminists didn’t have double standards, they’d have no standards at all. 😂🙄
@Rhiannon_K_82 @lgmaterna @TonyRobbins @TheKenWilber Its hilarious these Feminists say "Wel u support a man in office who said an objectifying thing to women" - when they support a MAN (Clinton) who LITERALLY raped dozens of women, &amp; his criminal wife who supported him, threatened ‡ smeared the women who tried to seek justice! LOl
@lgmaterna @Rhiannon_K_82 @TonyRobbins @TheKenWilber Did u all even watch the full 10min vid? Every word of what he said is true. And she STILL misinterpreted him. Do u disagree w what he said?
@jsconroy @TonyRobbins @TheKenWilber Yes! Thank God @realDonaldTrump is our President🇺🇸 Maybe a woman with real character &amp; who could be a role model for girls wil run in future
@jsconroy @TonyRobbins @TheKenWilber Lol, I didn’t vote for Hillary bc she was the WRONG woman. Not bc “it’s a man’s job.” Good grief, get out of your feminist echo chambers! 😂
@jsconroy @TonyRobbins @TheKenWilber I don’t think you’re seeing the big picture. With all due respect. ❤️
@jsconroy @TonyRobbins @TheKenWilber Question, do u think what’s happening is going to help, or hurt women in the long term? Do u think it’ll help or hurt gender relationships?
@jsconroy @TonyRobbins @TheKenWilber We already understand it’s rampant. It’s drilled into our heads everywhere every day. A lot of women remain in victim hood and blame
@TonyRobbins @TheKenWilber Yes @tonyrobbins ! I APPLAUD u for your firm stance on the #MeToo. Women do NOT grow emotionaly or spiritually by harboring hate &amp; resentment, remaining a victim, &amp; blaming "the man," rather than healing from it. #IStandWithTony THANK U! We should do a Podcast about this.
Yes @tonyrobbins ! This is EXACTLY what Ive been sayng about the #MeToo. Women do NOT grow emotionaly or spiritually by banding together w others, harboring hate &amp; resentment &amp; blaming "the man," rather than healng from it. #IStandWithTony https://t.co/I3zVgW4BiZ

Unlike Trump supporters, Liberals have no sense of humor. If we continue to go down the road that Libs wish to take us, we will be actively enslaving ourselves into a joyless, humorless, loveless, genderless, government-controlled future...Gee, sounds like fun! 🙄
@Questio61948476 @NewRightNetwork @bgood12345 Liberals —-&gt; They have no values or principles, or logical arguments so all they have is name-calling, bullying, and smear campaigns. Sad!

@Scanners101 You will be attractive to a percentage of girls, for sure. But as far as the 10s go, they do require at least a "decent" job (&amp; by decent I mean, not dead broke - a lot of wiggle room betwn "decent" and "rich." "Providorship" (moderately) &amp; ambition still important. #JustTheTruth
@Scanners101 For sure! And here's the deal.. As long as "the guy" also has a decent job (or his guitar is his primary career) - then guitar will totally elevate his sex appeal &amp; value. But just like anything, if a guy is a "Starving artist," then it isn't so sexy. Just tellin' it like it is;)

Thoughts on the #metoo Sports Illustrated swimsuit shoot?! Come ON...Cant guys go ONE place where they aren't bombarded by these messages? Also, do women really need to bare their naked bodies in front of men in order to.. "teach" men to not think of them as sexual objects? SMH

@johnkrygelski Of course I suspect that! It is definitely an agenda.
We need to encourage healthy #MASCULINITY that fosters their best masculine traits in healthy, constructive ways. Shaming men 4 simply existing as males &amp; makng “all men” apologize 4 crimes committed by a small group will only channel their masculinity in destructive ways. #MLGA
Now #MeToo gets its own TV Series?! I feel this is pushing men further away from women &amp; criminalizing normal masculinity. How can men &amp; womn love each other, or even want 2 spend time on a platonic or profesional level if there are so many bariers piling up to simply CONNECTING?

@HeidiBoelk Yes its definitly an attack on conservatives. They can't just let us have one or two things of our own, they need to censor all of it. I'm so tired of it. We need to fight back!
@USAMarineMomma Exactly. We need to fight for our future, if we want our children and grandchildren to have a decent future with love, marriage &amp; family
WHEN we open our hearts to #patriotism, theres no room for prejudice, no place for bigotry, no tolerance for hate. We need to focus on what UNITES us, not on those things that divide us. We dont need gender wars, race-wars, or victimhood. United we stand, divided we fall. Love!
@USAMarineMomma Exactly! Amen to that. This madness needs to stop but we need to fight for our values. 🇺🇸❤️👫

I think that’s really an issue you should deal with privately w your children. It should be be taught in s book or mass media, I don’t think
@BradeWeathers No. not saying eradicate LGBT at all. Its the constant pushing of adult concepts like gender-identity, sexual expression, transgenderism, etc to young children, before they are old enough to really understand, and encouraging them to "experiment," is, I believe, wrong to teach.
"Equality" doesnt mean “sameness,” in evry way, shape &amp; form. Trying to eradicate gender sets men/women up to be brutal competitors, rather than companions, &amp; certainly not romantic lovers. Men/Wmn r Differnt, but complimentary &amp; synergistic. Liberals, stop messing w/God! #MLGA
https://t.co/Zh4pNI9dbR&gt; "How to Explain #Gender expression to Kids: Queer Kid Stuff TV," Or How about rather than encouraging children to disown their biological sex or “try on another gender,” we nurture them 2 embrace their bodies? Children don't need this confusion. #MLGA
Another lie of #feminism is that women would love the feminization of men. But the truth is, women arent actually attracted to or respect soft, docile, weak men who are castrated of their assertiveness &amp; "balls." Sexual POLARITY is essential for attraction! #MakeLoveGreatAgain
Stay HOPEFUL, have faith, &amp; take proactive actions that put u in alignment and situations that will attract the perfect woman 4 you. Love can be yours in 2018!
