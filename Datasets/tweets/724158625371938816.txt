@benshapiro Whith your deep reflections on the intentions of our founding fathers do you think that we should move away from a party system and become a state where our politicians run as individuals?
@shoe0nhead So like if I know a guy who knows a guy who went to camp with some Nazis’s then are they nazis too? Lmao
With the US Supreme Court passing President Trumps travel ban policy what is your opinion of it? Open poll! Let’s see what people really think!  #TravelBan #SupremeCourt #UnitedStates @realDonaldTrump
@benshapiro What I’m trying to say is without a complete understanding of history it’s easy to cherry pick something bad of the past and compare it to something bad now. Even if they aren’t comparable.
@benshapiro This all comes back to the education system. Personally as a student of the public education system during the no child left behind era, I learned of these camps outside of school.
It’s important to find an answer that is fair to those who had no will of their own in illegal immigration while still finding a solution to our illegal immigration policies that secured the boarders properly. https://t.co/heHTeP0Hon
@dvibrationz @jordanbpeterson Pushing there to be no communication between the people and the state is not cecular democracy. Do you want the state to do whatever they want reguardless of what the population wants? Are you sure you know what authoritarianism is?
@dvibrationz @jordanbpeterson How is that far right? I am not implying that single voice should advise morality as the Catholic Church did in the past. There needs to be dialogue between community and state because the state should serve the community.
@jordanbpeterson I believe the biggest failing of the West is that the separation of religion and state created a modern separation of community and state. A void has been left where religion had previously advised for morality and it hasn’t been filled.

@SpeakerRyan I agree safety net programs that can't get the population back into the work force aren't long term solutions.
@ItsNotEmmi It is true that there is this culture in the far left that makes it trendy for people to be psudodepressed, but depression is real.
@drummer809 @exjon @benshapiro The people can fix politics, we just need to be more active in the system from a local level and up.
@drummer809 @exjon @benshapiro It won't, but national debt can lead to a ruined economy. The failures of elected officials solve it is ours as well for electing them.
@drummer809 @exjon @benshapiro We are the employers of everyone who's in office, if they can't get their jobs done then it's time we elect new people.
@realDonaldTrump But everyone else also pays taxes.
Regardless of how you feel about #climatechange renewable energy is an increasingly untapped new industry that will benefit the US economy. https://t.co/sTntTZ3h6t
@exjon @benshapiro The common sense solution is to both raise taxes and cut spending. It would remove the debt in the shortest amount of time. #TaxReform
@politico Sanctions haven't worked alone, they put pressure on North Korea, but only open dialogue with NK can ease the tention between our nations.

@Lo_K_87 @thehill What's racist about deporting illegal​ immigrants? They aren't targeting naturalized citizens or people with work/school visas.
@thehill Rather then spend millions to deport, civil service paths to citizenship could make millions in savings and in taxable citizens. #Dreamers
@realDonaldTrump made a mistake repealing #DACA it only hurts #Dreamers, the innocent in a immigration problem from long before their birth https://t.co/YOs6HWVz4C
@HillaryClinton admits the server was a mistake. Mistakes have consequences. Own it, take the heat, and don't shift blame.  #politics https://t.co/guBQapg4zk
The statues should stand as reminders of our failed past so history does not repeat. Move to museums if you must, not destroyed! @thehill https://t.co/gYMy1olcBQ

@shoe0nhead for some reason even think about listing all the words that define my characteristics as a person makes me anxious.
@shoe0nhead her justification for ML for women w/o kids and not men is that they get more stress undermines womens ability to do equal jobs.

@LeafGreenTweets It's a great/terrible human right, you give equal voice to the PhD and the moronic and its confused to have equal value.
@TheRalphRetort It is an all time low when public office defends a pedophile simply because he is one of them, noone should be above the law
@LeafGreenTweets the same human right that gave them the platform to be who they are.
@LeafGreenTweets The ironic plight of SJWs is that their brand of equality is only achievable through the censorship for all.
