@EmilyEggbert Something called cooking the books, do Republicans take credit for leaving the Government in a ‚ÄúSurplus‚Äù too since they were in control of the House &amp; Senate during Clinton‚Äôs reign???? Curious you little bias, bastard
@EmilyEggbert @PrisonPlanet B.A. in Economics at Columbia University (I don‚Äôt believe everything that Marxist Communist Uni believes) my brother works in the Federal Reserve. He laughes at dumbasses like you... #VoteBlue like a Jackass
@EmilyEggbert @PrisonPlanet - Believes Government Propaganda becauae it‚Äôs on a graph &amp; because Multi-Billion dollar Media outlets say the same. Here‚Äôs An Actual Fact Clinton = $2.2 Trillion Debt prove me wrong, Genius
@EmilyEggbert Hahahahahahahahahahaha (takes a break, drinks nice cold water, continues) hahahahahaha
@EmilyEggbert Ahead tell me what Clinton did to leave the Government ina ‚ÄúSurplus‚Äù. He must of cut Military Sending because he wasn‚Äôt a War President ‚ÄúOperation Fox‚Äù (Iraq), Bosnia, Somalia...cough* Dick Morrison he speaks truth, Clinton Lies like always
@EmilyEggbert @PrisonPlanet You really believe Clinton &amp; Alan Greenspan were some financial Genius? Lmaooo do you also give credit to the fact Republicans ran the House &amp; Senate during Clinton‚Äôs Bullshit Presidency??? Hahahaha GG son

@EmilyEggbert ‚ÄúSurplus‚Äù ask Dick Morrison who was in Bill Clinton‚Äôs administration how he ran a ‚ÄúSurplus‚Äù, he told Bill to fund the deficit with Societ Security Funds, hahahahaha you‚Äôre a fool.

@EmilyEggbert @PrisonPlanet Who said I was a Bush fan? Hahaha I‚Äôll spin circles around you in economics, I‚Äôve studied this all my life. You‚Äôre a retard, Clinton didn‚Äôt decrease the deficit, that‚Äôs a lie, you can‚Äôt decrease it while you rack in debt, do you know basic math??? He signed NAFTA &amp; GATT &amp;
@EmilyEggbert @PrisonPlanet #voteblue if you‚Äôre deluded Obama was a joke, so was Clinton, Obama ran $9.9 Trillion debt, Clinton doubled the debt ($2.2 Trillion). Last good Democrat was John F. Kennedy &amp; believe me you don‚Äôt have any others in the 20th century. Most Politicians suck but Trump is the RealDeal
