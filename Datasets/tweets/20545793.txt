The President's national emergency declaration is inaccurate, irresponsible, and unconstitutional! https://t.co/ULhToIcSJg
Thank you to the teachers of Wood Middle School in Wilsonville for inviting me to come speak with their 8th graders. I’m always happy to talk with students about being a Member of Congress, and to hopefully inspire a new generation of leaders! https://t.co/XoxGDfYqHS

POTUS has gone too far. Our founders gave the Legislative Branch, not POTUS, the express power to decide how to spend taxpayer $$. The POTUS’s job is to execute the will of Congress &amp; his action today is an infringement on the power delegated under Article 1 of the Constitution.
I've visited the US-Mexico border &amp; there is no national emergency. Families &amp; children seeking asylum from brutality in their home countries hold no threat. Yesterday, Congress passed an overwhelmingly bipartisan agreement on how to fund security along our southern border.
As a result of the testimony and outreach by the students of MSD High School in Parkland and students in my own district, I am cosponsoring HR 8, the Bipartisan Background Checks Act to require universal background checks on all firearm sales, like we have in Oregon.
Parents should be able to take their children to school each day knowing they will come home safely that night. My thoughts today are with the families of the 17 students who did not return home a year ago today.

There are common sense, bipartisan steps that we can take to curb &amp; prevent this from continuing to happen. We can start with background checks, holding hearings on gun violence, and conducting federal research into this epidemic.
It's been moving &amp; humbling this week to see the brave students from Parkland become so active, but the reality is that parents should be able to take their children to school each morning knowing that they will come home safely that night. This epidemic should not be happening.

My bill will immediately increase the #OTrule threshold more than 50% to $35,984 on December 1st. https://t.co/3bAvuvOHYK
Last month, I introduced a bill to help curb potential cuts &amp; demotions by phasing in the new #OTrule over 3 years rather than overnight.
Since the new #OTrule was announced, we've heard from employers &amp; employees who are concerned about implementing this increase overnight.
In May, the Department of Labor issued an update to the #OTrule, raising the outdated &amp; inadequate threshold from $23,660 to $47,476.

Roughly one in four adults experience mental illness each year yet only half receive treatment services.

Happy that @POTUS focused some of his #SOTU on changing our politics, rebuilding trust and working together. Unexpected, but very welcome.
RT @GerryConnolly: POTUS says fix our politics: nonpartisan redistricting and campaign finance reform. Overturn Citizens United
"We have to reduce the influence of money in our politics, so that a handful of families and hidden interests can’t bankroll our elections"
"We have to end the practice of drawing our congressional districts so that politicians can pick their voters, &amp; not the other way around"
"There are a whole lot of folks in this chamber who would like to see more cooperation, a more elevated debate in Washington."- @POTUS #SOTU
RT @KATUPolitics: "The future we want ... will only happen if we work together. ... it will only happen if we fix our politics," says @POTU…
@POTUS said "Democracy grinds to a halt without a willingness to compromise" in #SOTU &amp; that's why I strive to work w/ both parties often.
Having visited Cuba this fall, I've seen this. "Fifty years of isolating Cuba had failed to promote democracy" - @POTUS #SOTU
"Medical research is critical -- let’s make America the country that cures cancer once and for all." - @POTUS #SOTU
@POTUS: "I think there are outdated regulations that need to be changed &amp; there’s red tape that needs to be cut." Congress needs to examine
Agree - @POTUS "And despite all the political arguments we’ve had these past few years, there are some areas where Americans broadly agree."
@POTUS poses a question Congress should answer w/ bipartisanship- how can we make our politics reflect what’s best in us &amp; not what’s worst?

Median earnings for men in Oregon were $46,679	compared to just $37,555 for women—	an earnings ratio of just 80%. We need #EqualPayNow.

$435,049 – Amount of money lost throughout a woman’s working life-time as a result of the pay gap. #EqualPayDay
2058 – The year women will finally see pay equity, based on the rate that the pay gap has been closing since 1960. #EqualPayDay
#EqualPayDay symbolizes how long it takes women's earnings to catch up to what men made in the previous year -- 104 days is too long.

Time to go back to House or Senate Ag Committees, get rid of partisan politics &amp; pass a 21st Cent farm bill to strengthen farm&amp;food programs
Right wanted to increase nutrition cuts in the name of deficit reduction-driving away Dems-&amp; didnt even provide votes for passage. #farmbill
The failure of the House to pass bipartisan #farmbill from @HouseAgNews is a travesty. 2.5 yrs of work &amp; compromise hijacked by far right.
