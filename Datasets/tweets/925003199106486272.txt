@ewarren Yes senator 	We should let them know so it will be already aware to the people
Right there hope disappeared and my world was entangled in an infinite mystery and pain. Love died and sorrow resurrected.
Three years goes by and yet my hopes swept me towards my doom. It all came hitting so hard when reality tapped me on the shoulders, her lips came close to my ear in my guts I smiled cause I felt what I tend wasted was a blessing. Until I hard those whispers, I CAN'T BE WITH YOU.
How much was needed to change the tides, where as life push me from one edge to the other. As far as I know is as far as I see. The mind is attacked by the life that worries it more guilt more fear, more hope and more foolishness.
With my hands on my face I buried my head to the ground with my heart beating as through I was been chased by a Raven beast. That would have been better of than this. The torture, the pain, the lost sacrifices and the troubles all but a waste of a unrecoverable time.
I saw the crescent moon turn black as I was been battered with a sword pieced into my wounded heart, I watched my tears row down my chin falling to the dusty soil with the ground at his eminent grip, wanting to sink me into the earth crust.

I’m the one that’s got to die when it’s time for me to die, so let me live my life the way I want to. To live is the rarest thing in the world. Most people exist, that is all. Anyone who lives within their means suffers from a lack of imagination. https://t.co/Z7uJS5k7wc
I get busy living because i don't want to get busy dying. What lies behind me and what lies in front of me, pales in comparison to what lies inside of me.	Don’t gain the world and lose your soul, wisdom is better than silver or gold. https://t.co/4dbFYaOmfY
Lighten up, just enjoy life, smile more, laugh more, and don’t get so worked up about things. The trick in life is learning how to deal with it.	Be happy for this moment. This moment is your life.	Life is too important to be taken seriously. https://t.co/027UJpJikb

The heart, like the stomach, wants a varied diet. I tell you, in this world being a little crazy helps to keep you sane. We know what we are, but know not what we may be.
Do stuff. Be clenched, curious. Not waiting for inspiration’s shove or society’s kiss on your forehead. Pay attention. It’s all about paying attention. Attention is vitality. It connects you with others. It makes you eager.
Believe that life is worth living and your belief will help create the fact. https://t.co/hh4fdRrTXQ

Dost thou love life? Then do not squander time, for that is the stuff life is made of. Life is like playing a violin in public and learning the instrument as one goes on. In the end, it’s not the years in your life that count. It’s the life in your years.
@juliacunningham 	Hello Julia, how're you doing
Life is what happens when you’re busy making other plans, Very little is needed to make a happy life, it is all within yourself, in your way of. It is better to be hated for what you are than to be loved for what you are not. https://t.co/CuRGlKUHdI
Time means a lot to me because, you see, I, too, am also a learner and am often lost in the joy of forever developing and simplifying. If you love life, don’t waste time, for time is what life is made up
@KateAllenby Wow this is lovely 	I would have loved to make in dinning with you on that first sweet one
