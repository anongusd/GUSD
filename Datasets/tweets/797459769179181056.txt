@BruceBartlett That's because voters don't care about debts and deficits. They care about whether or not the people who receive government benefits "deserve" them.
@updatewithinfo @SeanTrende @benshapiro @SenSanders This bears repeating. Huge majorities of Americans say in polls that taxes on the rich should be higher, we should expand health coverage, and we should have universal gun background checks. Yet the GOP gets votes by saying these measures are tyranny or socialism or whatever.
