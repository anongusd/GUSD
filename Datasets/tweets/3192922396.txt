The economic proposals coming out of DC All lack rigor &amp; historical experience. But no society is healthy with a declining middle class, it was one of our great accomplishment. But not since the Gilded Age, have we been in this boat. But poor answers aren't the answer.
Wealth taxes have been repealed in ALL of the Nordic County's &amp; 70% tax in France which now has the highest unemployment of any major European economy. There's a hole in the leadership of our middle of the political spectrum-40% of us are now self-described Independents Moderates

Agree. Pulling out of Syria in this way is a betrayal of the Kurds and our other allies and a stain on our National Honor!! It appears we may be doing this so Turkey can eliminate our best fighting ally in the area. I hope not, but also as a favor to Putin! https://t.co/GKEJ8VjNAV
Wow!! https://t.co/fkebjrxYBr
A horrable betrayal to the Kurds and our other allies. For years the only people we could get to fight were the Kurds and we promised we would not desert them. Clearly this is a stain on our country's honor!! https://t.co/qjIOGdBCpy
Amen, we are betraying our allies in Syria by moving out as what appears to be a favor to Turkey and Putin. https://t.co/cy51wnNABK
During WW 2, after the takeover of western Europe, the only entire country was Britain, and it's a commonwealth. After Poland, Russia's entry really gave the Allies a chance. The two carried the incredible burden alone, with only arms for the US. https://t.co/0lF6ZRiwuc
There is absolutely nothing wrong with measured well thought out immigration. But the kind of unrestricted mass immigration from just one area predictably caused chaos &amp; conflict. Merkel &amp; the EU's overreaching ambitions will go down in infamy for the destabilization of Europe. https://t.co/nmLxGEWauZ
We need these leaders here again. Doing what is best for the country regardless of being besieged by special interest groups. https://t.co/k4fTvn8x7Q
