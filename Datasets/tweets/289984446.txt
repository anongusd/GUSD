@Alyssa_Milano Apparently they think we're pretty damned stupid because they continue to behave as if Trump is a normal, rational POTUS.
@Jim_Jordan This is not a scandal or even a surprise. @RepCummings kept the parameters of the hearing narrow for a variety of reasons. Of course he'd discuss that with Cohen from the get-go as he'd need that information in preparing his opening remarks.		Even your surprise was obviously fake
One thing about GOP contention that #Cohen was violating attorney/client privilege by taping Trump--That only applies to normal attorney/client relationships. When a client &amp; attorney are engaged in criminal conduct, privilege goes out the window. 		#CohenHearing

Many government workers haven't gotten their back pay yet from the shutdown.		Now Trump is talking about another one. 		Anybody using a shutdown as a political tool needs to stop. This hurts government workforce, the economy &amp; all Americans.
@realDonaldTrump I'm thinking back to the campaign when you said you could be "so presidential."		 Referencing the forced migration of innocent, indigenous people to slam a potential political rival is about as anti-presidential as we've seen you get.
@realDonaldTrump As the poster child for double standards, you must be giddy. 		Are you suggesting that the Lt. Governor, credibly accused of sexual assault --as were your SCOTUS pick &amp; yourself--is only facing impeachment proceedings because he's a man of color? 		#CentralPark5
@realDonaldTrump What a ridiculous poll. We don't have open borders &amp; Dems don't want open borders. 		It's like saying the GOP wants all poor people to wear cardboard shoes. It's absolute nonsense.
@realDonaldTrump Stop lying to people.		Dems don't want a cap on violent people being arrested. That is absurd.		Dems want a cap on detention beds which will still allow for all the bad-behavers to be detained, tried &amp; deported. It just forces ICE to focus on them first.
@realDonaldTrump No sane person who truly cares about this country or its people wants a shutdown.		You sound like you want one though. My only question is ...why?
@realDonaldTrump What is going on? You're POTUS &amp; you don't know what is happening with the negotiations to keep our government running?		Or maybe you're lying about what is going on--The Dems want to limit the number of detention beds so ICE will deport criminals first, as promised by you.

@JuddLegum It's because Elizabeth Warren is a woman. 		Apparently if you're a crass, loudmouthed man you can do or say whatever the Hell you want, but a woman, no matter how polite or quiet, must never say or do anything to offend anyone, ever...even a crass, loudmouthed man.
@realDonaldTrump All recent Presidents except yourself have provided tax returns *before* being elected &amp; every year in office. They've divested themselves to avoid conflicts. You've done none of this.		This is about national security. That you fight it only proves investigations to be necessary.
@realDonaldTrump Oh please. This from the guy who launched his own "investigation" of Obama's birthplace from the private sector. 		The person who occupies the Oval Office must not be vulnerable to blackmail or be beholden to any foreign power. If you can't stand the heat, get out of the kitchen

@Jim_Jordan You know as well as I that the people *walking* here from Guatemala, Honduras &amp; El Salvador are asylum seekers. Sending troops to greet them is an unAmerican aggression.		This is not who we are.
If that means we maybe need to focus less on Governor Racistface to focus more attention on the babies who need our voices, so be it. 		Racism sucks. In all its forms. 		We can't change what a dumbassed med student did 30 years ago. But maybe we can help those babies.
We can't let Trump get away with treating human children like puppies or kittens in the pound. We can't let it go when he uses his disregard for anything like order or due process as an excuse for destroying people's lives.		Fixing this mess needs to be priority #1 for all of us.
However Trump seems to have a lot to say about a Democratic Governor wearing blackface decades ago.		While I wholeheartedly agree that we can't let people get away with racism, I feel even more strongly that we can't let Trump get away with snatching babies from their mamas.
The Trump Administration admits there were many more children taken from their parents in their "no tolerance policy" than anybody knows. They don't seem to know how many kids there are, where they are or which kids go with which parents.		They have no plan to fix it.
Wearing blackface is wrong. Very wrong.		You know what else is wrong? Taking children away from their parents just because they happen to be in this country with dark skin. Lying about how many of those kids exist. Using your own incompetence as an excuse for not reuniting them.

@SRuhle I think you might be thinking of Steve Bannon. IIRC he was registered to vote in 4 different places during the 2016 campaign. No evidence he voted more than once though AFAIK.
@tedlieu @POTUS Businessmen, especially now, are all about the bottom line.		Government is about serving &amp; protecting the people &amp; this great land.		They are entirely different things. I wish candidates had the guts to say so.
@SenTedCruz @POTUS Democrats don't advocate open borders. Just because Trump says nonsensical things, doesn't mean you have to parrot him.		If he jumped off the Brooklyn Bridge, would you jump too?
@SenTedCruz This is a big fat lie. 		You voted for the bill before Christmas. Did you change your mind because of Donald Trump or Ann Coulter? Or are you merely holding with McConnell's obstructive party line?		You, Trump &amp; the GOP own this shutdown. Texas won't forget it either.
@SteveScalise Don't even. 		Trump said at the outset that he was "having a shutdown." There's absolutely no excuse for it. No piece of legislation justifies the loss of services, maintenance &amp; income to so many Americans.		 If Democrats had given in, Trump would do it again.

@LindseyGrahamSC You have got to be kidding me. My family hasn't been weathering over a month--through Christmas, for heaven's sake--without paychecks to have that man get 1 penny for his stupid, unnecessary wall. Especially if it only keeps the government open for 3 lousy weeks.
@renato_mariotti I agree. But I hope they'll have the sense to pass a clean bill to reopen the government on the way to the courthouse.

This #TrumpShutdown is awful. I hate what it's doing to families, whether those families are affected by the loss of a paycheck, government services or both. I also hate what it's doing to the humans in those families, whether workers or dependants.		This shutdown is inhumane.
I want people to understand what it's to someone like my husband when they're told their job is "nonessential." Or what a hardworking person might feel about how they're valued when they're asked to work for more than a month without pay.
The idea that this man has been out of work for more than a month just kills me. 		There's been a lot of talk about how the shutdown has affected workers' wallets &amp; the needs of the nation &amp; all that's the main story.		But it's also important to consider what it does to souls.
The other thing about my husband is that he has a strong as steel work ethic. He gives his best every day. When I tell him about someone I've met, the 1st question he asks is what they do for a living bc his work is so vital to him. He loves his family but work defines him.
But I can tell you that this is a man who genuinely cares about the people who truly pay his salary.I		**More to come soon** (I need a short Dr Mom break)
My husband has worked for the US Govt for almost 25 years. As his skills &amp; qualifications have grown, he's moved on to new jobs &amp; challenges. But always--ALWAYS--he's seen his basic job as the same thing. Protecting taxpayers. From whom or what I won't say, as he wouldn't approve
#Consquences 		#TrumpShutdown #MitchShutdown https://t.co/IPOkA98sST

As a wife of a furloughed federal employee, the last thing I want to do next Tue--in the likely event that my husband is still out of work--is to watch that vile man preen about &amp; lie from the House chamber. 		Unless he's reopening the govt, I don't care what he has to say.
Funny how he cares so very much about delivering this speech, but not about delivering a budget to the country last September, when it was due.

@realDonaldTrump There is no humanitarian crisis that will be fixed with a wall. But here are some actual humanitarian crises you could fix:		800,000 civil servants going w/o pay for a month, some of them still being required to work		People across America not able to receive necessary services
@SherylNYT I wish I could be optimistic about this. Not crazy about the shelf life of the CR, though there's probably no way around it. 		My favorite furloughed federal employee just really wants to get back to work. Crossing my fingers for that to happen soon &amp; for govt to STAY open.
I'd never want to work in a slaughterhouse or meat packaging plant. It's got to be disgusting, right? 		Imagine what it's like to be one of the people working in these places to ensure safety of meat, poultry &amp; fresh eggs sold in the US, who've been working for free all month!

@LindseyGrahamSC @realDonaldTrump Not a single word for the workers going without a month's pay. You singlehandedly tanked the jobs in this country for a month over a non-issue &amp; you can't spare a thought for the families who's backs you did it on.
@marcorubio @realDonaldTrump @POTUS Obstruction is Mitch McConnell refusing to bring a vote that he knows will pass. 		Obstruction is Trump walking out of a meeting with a childish "Buh-bye!"

Exactly! @realDonaldTrump thinks a shutdown is a negotiation tactic. It isn't. 		This #TrumpShutdown is a failure to do his most basic duties.

@megdad Um, yeah. I know the difference between news &amp; comedy. Many do not. That's probably a factor in a reality TV huckster becoming POTUS.
@megdad The skit started by explaining that the SSA name change office--probably not a thing--was crowded because it had limited hours during shutdown. There was an earthquake. Everybody in the office had a ridiculous name.
Funny as the goofy names are, this #SNL skit is based on a false premise. Social Security is fully funded so they wouldn't have limited hours.
@realAliTweets With the possible exception of Anderson Cooper, yes. None of these people came out of the box with 7 figure salaries. They worked hard &amp; paid their dues. Most come from relatively humble beginnings.
@bjcreigh What gets me is his explanation. It's because the White House domestic staff is furloughed due to the shutdown. Let's just highlight the fact that furloughed workers can't even afford this miserable "feast."
I can't be the only baby boomer who's annoyed by big pharma corps using saccharine covers of classic rock hits in their ads.
@RepMarkMeadows A bill has been passed in the House. It passed in the Senate almost unanimously before the shutdown. Yet McConnell won't let it be brought to a vote now? Why? Because the POTUS is having a tantrum &amp; won't sign it? News flash. You all have the power to override his veto so do it.
@SteveScalise @realDonaldTrump Stop lying about Democrats &amp; their views on border security. We just think you should treat people like human beings. Also, illegal immigration is DOWN.

For our family, the result of this culture came into sharp view this weekend when our youngest child didn't want to ask for money he needed for school--$15 for drivers ed class. We were able to give it to him, but it was a gut punch that he was worried about it.
This shutdown culture has an effect on the morale of the federal workforce &amp; on the financial &amp; emotional health of their families. It can't be good for the economy either, as there are blocks of time where large numbers of people stop making costly and/or discretionary purchases
@AliVelshi Since the 1st Boehner House, federal workforce families have had their household economies held hostage by the continual threat of shutdown. 		We have held off on buying appliances, furniture, school clothes, Christmas gifts, medical testing &amp; summer school.
@AliVelshi Thank you for all your work on behalf of federal employees affected by the shutdown. Apart from real world effects, there's a huge emotional toll. 		How many times since 2011 have CRs have been in danger of expiring w/o a deal? Or a can kicked 2-3 months down the road?

Mitch McConnell can fix this at any time. Call a vote. The bill has the votes to pass. If Trump vetos it, there will surely be enough votes to override it. 		Trump is acting like a toddler. McConnell 's refusal to vote without his say so puts him in the same playpen. https://t.co/zpFkrbrjMZ
@realDonaldTrump You're the POTUS. Shuttering the government isn't a negotiation tactic--it's a failure to execute the most basic of your duties to the American people. 		In case you didn't understand those 8th grade words, I said you're a failure who's failing the people who voted for you.
@cshepherdadams Indeed.
For Trump, the wall isn't a campaign promise. It's a chance to build something again. To exhibit his strength, as he sees it.		True strength would come from knowing the wall is unnecessary. That it would be frivolous.		 Of course, @realDonaldTrump is too weak for that. (3/end)
Trump has a visceral need to build something big with his name on it. Despite his reputation, he hasn't been building for a while now. He puts his name on other people's buildings now.		He made his campaign all about the wall because that's what he sees as his strength. (2)
When Trump started his presidential campaign I'd joke about how he might Trumpify iconic American structures. Gold-tinted White House windows. Renaming the Washington Monument, Trump Tower, DC. The redwood forest would be the Trump Trees because they're tall &amp; majestic. (1)
As someone with a furloughed federal employee in the family, I cannot stomach watching Trump's address tomorrow. He doesn't care about the federal work force or the millions of Americans they serve. He just wants to build his freaking, useless wall. #TrumpShutdown

When January rolls around, Jeff Sessions will be called before House committees. He will no longer be able to assert executive privilege.
@rudepundit @allanbrauer They are gunning for Mueller, that's true. @AliVelshi or one of his guests just described this as a car chase, if we were in a movie. Mueller's in a tricked out SUV &amp; he knows the backstreets &amp; alleys better than anyone. IOW, he's prepared for this.

@Chris42627775 I know. I sometimes try to reason with Trump supporters but most won't listen. Only those few news sources &amp; Trump himself are telling the truth in their eyes.		What worries me is that it's going to be virtually impossible to convince these folks of the truth when it comes out.
Trump called on the media to stop *their* attacks. He blamed the press, essentially, for doing their jobs properly while showing us, in spectacularly egregious fashion, how utterly incapable he was of performing the most basic duties of his own. (End thread)
@POTUS at first could only quote his VP's statement in a tweet, though he later read the proper words aloud.		When he arrived at a political rally all bets were off. He blamed the media for what he called dishonest reporting, as if we hadn't heard his hatred with our own ears.
@PressSec at first managed to do the right thing, with a statement that at least included most of the right words. However, she later blamed the media for reporting the truth about POTUS's verbal attacks on the bomber's targets. There was no press briefing, a glaring failure
The free press did their job admirably, both yesterday &amp; today. CNN, in particular, managed to explain what was happening before going to a commercial when a possible bomb was found their own workplace. Some CNN journalists continued to report from the sidewalk outside.
It's the job of the press to keep us informed &amp; to provide context &amp; analysis of the facts that are known. In this case, it would've been malpractice for them to omit the fact that those targeted by the bomber had been critical of POTUS &amp; targets of his vitriol in return.
It's the job of @PressSec to echo POTUS's reassurances &amp; to give the American people, thru their reps in the press, the chance to have questions answered. Even if there are no real answers to give, a White House Press Briefing is a reminder that govt is working to keep us safe.
The White House has absolutely failed in its response to the attempted bombings of the last 2 days. It's ridiculous that I have to say this but it's POTUS's job to calm the country, bring us together, denounce the violence &amp; assure us that those responsible will be punished.

I can't promise to ignore every petty offense. #MelaniaInterview 		But I am going to try. 		(End of thread)
I'm going to try harder to focus on the things that really matter &amp; not letting them disappear in yesterday's news cycle. 		Our democracy is in danger &amp; people are suffering along with it. 		That's what I need to talk about--the real things that Trump &amp; his followers are doing.
These are all real abuses. They're abusive of human beings, our norms &amp; our democracy. With the sea of wrongs it's easy to overlook or forget some of the most important ones, especially when Trump &amp; Friends distract us with nonsense. #Kanye 		I've done it myself. #MelaniasJacket
I'm sure I've missed quite a few of the things Trump has done that make us feel as though our heads will explode. Not a day goes by when I don't shout, "Oh my God!" at the TV or my Kindle. 		 Please add the outrages that I've missed. They are too numerous to remember them all.
--Giving tax breaks to the 1% which don't help--&amp; in some cases hurt--middle class folks &amp; which add trillions to national debt		--Not revealing his tax returns, unlike every POTUS candidate since Jimmy Carter		--Credible reports of decades of tax fraud
--Not believing women		--Continuing support of #SCOTUS nominee, even after blatant lies under oath &amp; credible accusations of sexual assault		--Beaming at crowds who chant "Lock her up," whether in reference to @HillaryClinton , @SenFeinstein or a sexual assault  #Survivor
--Dismantling the #ACA piece by piece, in an effort to ensure its failure so he can declare #Obamacare a disaster		--Using threats of a government shutdown to get his stupid wall		--Suggesting that we might end term limits for presidents		--Revolving door for West Wing staffers
--Constant lies about big things &amp; little things		--No consideration of Americans in peril #HurricaneMaria #HurricaneMichael 		--Paying lip service to victims of tragedy without showing empathy for human suffering or doing anything to prevent future tragedies #Parkland
--Profiting from presidency by taking frequent trips to own properties, which charge government for Secret Service rooms, golf carts, etc		--Emoluments, including those from country accused of murdering WaPo journalist		--Constant attacks on journalists &amp; their work
--Offering way too much to dictatorship with nuclear weapons in return for vague promises of disarmament		--Refusing to acknowledge that dictatorship doesn't appear to be compliant with disarmament deal		--Refusal to acknowledge that a hostile foreign power hacked our election
--Tariffs that play to workers' fears but actually make blue collar jobs less secure		--Insistence on renegotiating trade deals that does little or nothing for American workers &amp; harms our relationships with allies		--Treating dictators like normal, democratic leaders
--Refusal to accept refugees fleeing violence &amp; domestic abuse		--Reducing the number of refugees welcomed into the country		--Putting children in tent detention without any state oversight of facility of staff		--Reports of abuse by ICE agents		--Children drugged in detention
--Reports that POTUS 's son-in-law gave classified into to Saudis which may have been used to round up, torture &amp; kill Saudi citizens		--Refusal to sign a UN resolution saying it's wrong to kill people for being LGBT		--Disrespecting our closest allies
We have reached that moment when there's so many things to be outraged about that it's hard to fully express our objections to them all.		--Toddlers going before judges alone.	--Children deported w/o notifying parents	--No condemnation of journalist's murder
@MSNBC Clearly they've known this for at least 36 hours &amp; Trump hasn't even denounced it as a despicable act. He's hedging. 		He's going to use his Kavanaugh strategy here. "You can't ruin a good country's reputation without hard evidence."
@GeorgeTakei If the Trump Admin truly cared about justice, they would recognize the fact that most victims of sexual report don't report at all &amp; those who do often take years to do so. 		They also wouldn't have refused to condemn governments that make being LGBT a capital offense.

@JayPako @eclecticbrotha Totally agree. Also had to follow. Anyone who quotes Jane Austen in their profile is someone whose opinions I want to hear.
@joncoopertweets This is horrendous. American authorities should ALWAYS be there when there's a natural disaster. This means EVERY hurricane, not just the first in a season.
@CyrusMMcQueen @rhonda_whitman As a wise person once said, women want to know what is on, while men want to know what else is on.		However I can't say this is always true of either gender. My daughter changes radio stations so often I had to make a rule about it for riding in the car.
@leeleeb50 I think he's trying to say that it doesn't matter if he's gay or not without offending the homophobes amongst his South Carolina voters.
@leeleeb50 With the Trump Administration rolling back environmental protections, climate change is only going to get worse. We're already seeing multiple hurricanes each year. FEMA needs to be led by someone who sees the danger ahead &amp; allows the career employees to prepare for it.
@leeleeb50 I think FEMA is ill prepared for responding to more than 1 hurricane at a time. The career workers there know what to do, but Trump's agency leaders suck. 		Just like last year, the first hurricane gets all the attention &amp; aid. The others, not so much.
@JayPako @eclecticbrotha I like the voting by mail option. We should make it easier for people to do that. I have a family member whose work/commute day is 5AM-6:30PM. She's voting early but a lot of states are making that option scarce.
@mlvassallo @eclecticbrotha IMO any bill of this sort should include some kind of automatic voter registration for all who are eligible. For service people maybe there should be a provision that sends absentee applications to employers. Postage free.

4) Talk to people. You're not likely to sway a die-hard Trumper, but if your friends &amp; family are moderates you can share your concerns, provide info, etc. Call loved ones &amp; remind them to vote. #Hillary wrote in What Happened about all those who apologized for not voting.
2) Retweet those candidates. Every time you see them. Think it won't matter because you don't have many followers? RT with a comment &amp; add a few hashtags. 		3)Put out yard signs. They not only increase visibility for each candidate, they remind folks that Election Day is coming.
Are you someone like me, with chronic health issues &amp;/or responsibilities that keep you from doing a lot of volunteer work? 		There are still simple things you can do to help. 		1) Follow Dem candidates--not just the ones on your ballot, but nationwide.

...Donald Trump was actively trying to dishonor Hillary. He also dishonored the office he now holds, all women &amp; the legacy of #AnitaHill 		The GOP, in supporting him then &amp; in supporting #Kavanaugh now, dishonored them also.
When #HillaryClinton was our candidate, it was wrong for people to judge her on her husband's actions. 		When a tape showed #Trump bragging about sexual assault, that should have been the end of his campaign.		When he brought Bill Clinton's accusers to a debate...
While I didn't want to lose #BillClinton as POTUS, I knew that something had to be done to show that lying under oath &amp; sexplay with interns are not okay. 		#AnitaHill brought us forward with her testimony. We couldn't go backwards just because this guy was one of ours.
In the late 90s then POTUS Clinton was accused of sexual misconduct by a woman who worked for the State of Arkansas when he was governor.		Though I'm a lifelong Democrat, I supported her right to sue. I support all women.		#AnitaHill spoke for all women.
In popular culture, sexual comments in a workplace came to be followed by acknowledgement that such comments were not allowed.		Calendars &amp; posters depicting women as sex objects began to come down from workplace walls.		Thanks to #AnitaHill
It's a little thing. I--one woman in small town Ohio--no longer had to endure hurtful, disgusting comments from a creepy coworker.		It wouldn't have happened that way if #AnitaHill hadn't come forward.		There have been much bigger changes too, though not nearly big enough.
With my husband's support, I told my assistant manager what was happening. 		She told the manager.		I was asked to put my complaint in writing, which I did.		The harasser was immediately fired &amp; a copy of my letter was put in his employment file.
I told my husband that I wanted to do something about the harassment. It wasn't an easy choice. We lived in a small town &amp; jobs were scarce. He worked for the same company in another location. It wouldn't be good for him if I was deemed a troublemaker. 		But #AnitaHill ...
Once it became apparent that this was not a passing comment, or a refrain for a day, I started to think about #AnitaHill 		She had come forward to talk about harassment &amp; people had been outraged. No, it hadn't kept her harasser off #SCOTUS but it shone light on workplaces.
The harasser kept a running commentary about my pregnancy &amp; his disgusting imaginings of my sex life. He didn't even stop when customers were within earshot. I was humiliated &amp; felt responsible for the fact that customers had overheard such things.
In early 1992, I was sexually harassed at work.		I was pregnant at the time &amp; constantly needing "morning sickness breaks" so everyone knew about it.		The harasser used my pregnancy as a tool to demean me. He said awful, graphic things about my husband, my baby &amp; myself.
We've been talking a lot about #AnitaHill lately &amp; how things haven't changed much in 27 years. In too many ways that's true. 		But I want Ms. Hill to know that she didn't testify in vain, that she did make a difference, however slight, for American women.

@SenatorCollins 		Per Maine State Police:	Rapes in 2016--383		Please think about those survivors, the survivors from other years &amp; those too fearful to come forward. How do they feel about having an accused rapist on #SCOTUS with no investigation of allegations? #MeToo
@IM_GODZFAVORITE Actually, according to Laurence Tribe--Ted Cruz's constitutional law professor--there is no SoL on attempted rape in Maryland, but that's not the point.		This is a lifetime appointment to the highest court in the land. #Kavanaugh needs to prove that he's worthy to serve.

@jrmkingston I'm sorry that happened to you but it doesn't mean #Kavanaugh is innocent. His freedom isn't at risk here. Dr. Blasey Ford is asking for more investigation before she testifies, which he should welcome if he's not lying. 		Btw, all women are women. We have nothing else in common.

@Luckydpd Actually, most sexual violence goes unreported. Plenty of women keep silent for decades. I believe Dr. Blasey Ford.

For anyone supporting #Trump to say #Kavanaugh 's accuser is lying is the height of hypocrisy. Trump lies like it's his real job. Kavanaugh lied under oath. Women accusing powerful men of sexual violence usually speak truth. #MeToo

Active shooter drills are sadly necessary, but they can intensify fears &amp; anxiety that kids feel about school. They can also reinforce the idea that hiding under a desk is as ineffective against an AR-15 as it is against a nuke.
