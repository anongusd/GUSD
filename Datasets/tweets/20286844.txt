Kemp: Doing nothing is no longer an acceptable solution. Our legislators at the federal level are doing nothing. Doing nothing - the carnage is going to continue. #gunconversation
Aiello: I understand youth want to be safe in school. I think there are ways to do that that don't infringe. Question having youth lead the push for policy change - their views will change over time. #gunconversation
Knutson: We got a setback, not a defeat with IP 43. We're reaching out all over the state. We'll come to a resolution that will make the state safer and be a bellwether for the nation. #gunconversation
Kemp: I think there are violent groups that promote that sort of thinking. But people who think they can overthrow the govt with AR-15s are mistaken. #gunconversation
Audience member: Elephant in the room. We have a significant number of gun owners who believe in the violent overthrow of the govt and that's the only reason they don't want to limit ammunition. #gunconversation
Q from audience member: What can we do to take action together? This isn't a debate about who's right and who's wrong. Facts are that people want to maintain rights and people want to be safe. #gunconversation
Audience member - I'm begging you to come together. I don't want any more school shootings. I don't want my niece to carry a gun to school.  #gunconversation
Q from audience: In our house, guns were a privilege not a right. I'm here to cross the aisle to reach out to help solve this issue. Ive lived with guns all my life, live in rural America. What's happening today is not what hunters want. #gunconversation
Knutson: You can have conversation if you're willing to move forward to solve a common problem. Is there common ground to address this major issue? #gunconversation
.@lgunderson: Is there common ground on working on role of mental health in gun violence episodes? #gunconversation
Knutson: We have to ask the moral and ethical question. Why does this nation have such a fascination with violence and weapons? Big money industry. #gunconversation
Kemp: Over time, we have changed the culture around drinking and driving - driver ed program, work training. We want to change the cultural thinking around guns. We're not going to stop all murders, but we need to change the thinking. #gunconversation
Aiello: What has changed in society? Guns were here before, they were in school parking lots in vehicles. There's something deeper going on in society than the gun itself. #gunconversation
Kemp: We're seeing high school kids across the country get up in arms about these shootings. They're tired of it. #gunconversation
Aiello: Are there mass shootings at gun ranges? Gun shops? Mass shooters going where they can do mass damage. How protect kids without giving up a right. Is the gun really the issue? #gunconversation
Knutson: Our young people, kindergarten through high school, not one has lived without lockdowns, without fear of a mass shooting. Need movement on both sides so young people can feel safe. We have to ask that of adults. #gunconversation
Aiello: The gun owner is always the one told to compromise. Hard to be on the side where you're always told to compromise.  #gunconversation
Aiello: While "assault weapons" has been a term used on a federal level, it's to make it easier to pass gun-control measures. #gunconversation
Knutson: I have no apologies (about IP 43). What we had was primed to be past in this state. It was beautifully written. #gunconversation
Aiello: On the issue of guns, if we want to be able to have a conversation, we have to stick to nonemotional, factual terms. Often see "weapons of war" "assault weapons," which confuse, stir emotion so that we split the people in the conversation. #gunconversation
Paul Kemp: Formed Gun Owners for Responsible Ownership to be a voice in the middle and raise questions about gun safety. If you have firearms, are they secured? That should not be a question that someone takes offense to.  #gunconversation
How to talk with people who think differently? Rev. Knutson: Taught early to use your dialogue, respect the people you're talking to. Have to be willing to engage the other person. It's not about good or bad, but how do we get to something together. #gunconversation
Rev. Knutson: What is that vision that we all work towards together? #gunconversation
Kemp: Different experience in rural areas. Grew up in Michigan. Keys left in car, doors unlocked. Never felt need to have a handgun for personal protection. #gunconversation
Aiello: Not every place is Portland. Rural areas - don't have the 15-20 minutes waiting for a deputy to respond. #gunconversation.
Aiello: We all want safety. That's why over 200,000 people have a concealed carry permit. They want to feel safe. #gunconversation
Dominic Aiello: Did not grow up with guns. At 13, developed fascination with archery, hunting. Guns have become part of my life - not because of the guns, but because of my lifestyle.  #gunconversation
Knutson: Why do we have weapons of war in our community?  Not about the second amendment, about weapons of war. #gunconversation
Rev. Knutson: Born into non gun-owning family. Never had animosity toward those who own guns. Recalled childhood friend finding father's gun, hit the trigger. Realized the power of the gun, and the responsibility that comes with it. #gunconversation
Paul Kemp: Dec. 11, 2012 - the afternoon my brother in law was shot and killed at clackamas town center. Got me personally angry because this was a very preventable shooting as are many others happening around country. #gunconversation
You can also watch our livestream of #gunconversation at https://t.co/tRFhToI8Yg
Speakers for #gunconversation are: Paul Kemp, petitioner for a gun-storage ballot initiative; Dominic Aiello, head of Oregon Outdoor Council; Rev. Mark Knutson, a petitioner behind an effort to ban assault weapons. Panel moderated by Oregonian editorial page ed Laura Gunderson.

Last Q: What do lawmakers have to do this session? What can we put off? #oretalks
Ferrioli: Btm line. Every single state program shld be evaluated for efficiency, cost and whether meets priority. #ORETalks
Brown: I've requested study for apples-apples comparison on state employees. Historically state emps paid less, better benefits. #ORETalks
@csheketoff Here's one: Physical education, though it was not passed in the last two biennia. Still unfunded, however.
Gov. Brown: Agency heads tasked every day with delivering services to Oregonians better, save taxpayer dollars. #oretalks
Hass: You can argue too many regs, but low unemployment shows Oregon doing something right. #ORETalks
Ferrioli: Need to work with biz instead of agst them. Change Oregon from being a "progressive laboratory." #oretalks
Audience comment: Not against biz paying tax, but slow down on new regs for biz. Sick leave, min wage, now predictive scheduling. #ORETalks
Ferrioli: If want new tax, put it in constitution. Don't promise to solve problems with new tax that can be changed every 2 yrs. #oretalks

Gov. Brown: Question is whether have support to move fwd on revenue proposal. #oretalks
Gov. Brown: We have broad support in legis to move fwd on cost-containment. Support to move fwd on particular PERS proposals. #oretalks
Nesbitt: Every biennium that goes by without dealing with the known knowns makes it that much harder to get costs in control. #oretalks
Nesbitt: There are solutions on PERS side to maintain adequate benefit that's more affordable to taxpayers, bend cost curve. #ORETalks
Ferrioli: Our priorities have been on state employees, not on students. #oretalks
Ferrioli: Some of most generous salary, compensation packages for employees. Making Oregon a great place for state employees. #ORETalks
Gov. Brown: We need to create seamless system of education; sustain investment in rural economic dev; continue growing economy. #ORETalks.
Gov. Brown: Hope my mother isn't watching this. My mother is tighter than a tick. That's my approach to state budget. #ORETalks
Hass: There are some states that do really good job funding schools. Tennessee, Minnesota, etc - not initiative/referendum states. #ORETalks

Ferrioli: Unless you connect tax structure to right set of priorities, connect to growth rate of economy, always over your skis. #oretalks

Gov. Brown: 3. Costs and risk sharing being discussed in legislature. #oreTalks

Bayer: Use gut instincts. I give a dollar to first person who asks me every day. Then I move on. No need for crisis. #homelessness
Question: should I give spare change to homeless person asking for it? #homelessness
Bayer: we have to think of shelters as triage. Cannot front load all money into shelters. Not the answer to ending #homelessness

RT @DanaTims: Note: The board's Cogen-resignation resolution amounted to nothing more than a no-confidence vote since it was non-binding
Four commissioners vote in favor. @JeffCogen votes against. Resolution fails for lack of unanimity.

Notes disrespect shown toward women on commission by others testifying today.
Man who says he is testifying on behalf of other activists: "How do I expect you to represent me when you can't represent me?
Another man testifies saying decision of whether to keep @JeffCogen should be up to voters. Resignation robs voter of their "sacred right."
" I hope and I pray that there is not a political motivation here." Man questions whether resolution fueled by some1 wanting @JeffCogen job.
Those testifying include several people who identify themselves as friends or acquaintances of @JeffCogen.
Former intern at multco: talks of BPA ban and how @JeffCogen explained to him. "Keep your head up."
TJ Browning testifies: "This is a diversion. this is beneath this body." Asks board to wait, and could change support based on investigation
"What you're doing is wrong wrong wrong...." Tears up voter card says no longer a democrat.
NE Portland man testifies: "We have a new group of mean girls in office now...Each of you is a disgrace to your office."
Affair was not equivalent of an impeachable offense, Hershey says. Wait for investigation. "Why deliver a verdict before you get the facts?"
Edward Hershey testifies. "The Brooklyn in me can still sense when people are piling on."
Public testimony: "from a taxpayer standpoint... This is a distraction because we are allowing it to be... This motion seems so premature."
"I deserve a chance for the facts to come out,"@jeffcogen says. Says we should wait for investigation, not make decisions in media frenzy
.@jeffcogen apologizes, talks of pain to family, community. "I'm deeply sorry and I hope that I will be able to work to reduce this pain."

Chief Mike Reese: police officers need better relationships with social service partners.
City council Amanda Fritz: city will unveil new number for citizens to call for mental health help instead of 911.
Adams: already Portland Police making changes. New training center and advisory council. Drug testing and evaluations in place or underway.
Mayor Sam Adams: We get a failing grade for dealing with growing number of Portlanders with mental issues.
Perez: agreement calls for community feedback and input on portland police practices.
Perez: Additional concerns - it is impossible to ignore the tensions that exist between PPB and communities of color.
Perez: statewide mental health infrastructure has many deficiencies. Largest mental health facility in communities across US is jail.
Perez: preliminary agreement calls for police to develop protocols for interacting w mentally ill; establish mental health desk for 911 call
Perez: cites use of tasers and multiple tasings of mentally ill. Amount of force used too great for level of violation suspected.
Perez: most uses of force lawful but reasonable evidence showing Portland Police pattern or practice of excessive use of force.
Asst US Atty General Tom Perez: serious deficiencies in use of force by police but also an agreement to identify "a road forward."
