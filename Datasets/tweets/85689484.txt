Thank you to everyone who voted to keep Mark Amodei in Congress. Follow @MarkAmodeiNV2 to see what he's up to now. https://t.co/0T8FqvGIXN
Election Day is tomorrow. Head to the polls and vote to keep Nevada’s Congressman working for you: https://t.co/f1hcSQpRUu https://t.co/jzfK4IqR1s
Mr. Evans disagrees with the county commissions representing over 65% of the population of CD2 on the fact that lands bills are a good thing https://t.co/6NhtLWbUn6
Why won't Mr. Evans share the whole story about Amodei's voting record and his investment in #NV? How is Mr. Evans #GettingStuffDone?
Do you believe #Nevadans can manage our state's public lands? Vote for Mark Amodei to keep us in control: https://t.co/PKPG8LFKXF
Mark Amodei is focused on solving the issues #Nevadans face, and even voted against his party on Dreamer issues to #GetStuffDone. https://t.co/HpAwzG78aW
We agree with the RGJ. "He has shown an ability to get things done in Congress more than other Nevada representatives," RGJ, Oct. 24, 2016
Today, Mr. Evans agrees with Republicans on the fact that our healthcare needs reform. Where is his reform plan? #RadioSilence
Lands bills are a good thing. Ask the six #Nevada tribes if the Nevada Native Nations Land Act is a win for them: https://t.co/X9vVH9tuvv https://t.co/Dpgwx8wUSI
I guess we’re not going to hear where Mr. Evans stands on Nevada's mining or agriculture industry. #RadioSilence.
Congressman Amodei spends his time in #Nevada talking to the people. When will Mr. Evans start interacting with #ThePeople? https://t.co/9gk1cqVFQF
#AmodeiDelivers for Nevadans with a record of accomplishment as opposed to Mr. Evan's record of failure for #thepeople. https://t.co/fI9AhGeHhh

What do Clinton and Amodei agree upon? That a candidate ought to make full financial disclosure of their past. Petition 11-53588BTB
Mr. Evans only received 45.12 percent of votes in #CD2. We wonder why a majority of his own party didn't support him in the primary. https://t.co/WwJkn0OXHW

Those who've never been elected use the term "career politician". https://t.co/HTHfJXPnBX
