@non_neocon @charliekirk11 Id be scares but i cant affort the to necessary to shit my pants. Open the govt and deal with border security.
@BTGreen87 @charliekirk11 So its my fault Trump is proud to close the govt over the border wall? Seems like the only proactive thing i can do is vote. Guess you could be proactive too. How bout you send me a check till the govt opens. That way you can understand the hurt of almost a million people
@BTGreen87 @charliekirk11 Are you serious? You dont know me or where my back is. You assume the share economy exists in rural areas. You assume my bills can be paid with a service job. You assume the any industry can give jobs to 800,000 furloughed employees that would quit at any time?
@BTGreen87 @charliekirk11 Are you trying to shame me for wanting to pay my bills? We could deal with border security and i could get paid at the same time. I am also not disparaging army men, who signed up to protect our freedoms and govt that isnt working. Sorry, disparage means saying bad things.
@charliekirk11 We are not with you, President Trump. I deserve to be paid.

@LindseyGrahamSC @realDonaldTrump If it is such a crisis, why did you vote for a clean CR without a wall? https://t.co/ZSxhwGE1LY
@JohnCornyn @playbookplus Just because you say something over and over again doesn't make it true. Normalizing a wall makes it no less wasteful or technologically lacking.
@w_terrence What if Obama said he grabs women by the pussy without asking. #trumpshotfirst
@Hubert1863 @JohnCornyn The wall will keep these people out (as long as they don't know about ladders)
@JohnCornyn You might want to stop heroin use and sex trafficking in your own  country first. Why did you vote for a spending bill last month if we HAVE to have a wall now?
@JohnCornyn @YahooNews Border security does not equal a wall. You know this because you approved a spending bill already. Send it to the president you partisan hack.
This is socialism. #wall #Shutdown https://t.co/dLEYC3VT0v
@ChuckGrassley Like that vote that passed the senate already? Looks like republicans are scared they will look bad. Won't even vote on laws sent from the house. Daddy Trump keeps changing his mind. Why dont you tweet after you get your own party on the same page
@ABCPolitics @TerryMoran Stop allowing her on. As soon as she called you sarcastic the interview should be over. If you don't want Trump lying, stop giving liers a national voice.

@JohnCornyn Trump said he'd own the shut down. Why yall blaming Nancy?
@chattycathy0201 @GrahamLedger @OANN Where is that number from? How do you know that would be cost after appropriate border security without a wall? The cartel can use planes. Most illegal immigrants are people who overstay visas. We would still be paying that cost on those people.
@chattycathy0201 @GrahamLedger @OANN You would spend 5 bill on a detterent? Idk bout you but if i pay good money for something, it better work. Could there be more technological advanced detterents?
@chattycathy0201 @GrahamLedger @OANN This isnt an argument against securing our border. Its an argument against using outdated tech with a 5 Billion dollar price tag. Who is going to pay for upkeep on the wall? How does it stop planes? Ladders? Tunnels?
@DonaldJTrumpJr @realDonaldTrump Source on that 95%?
@GrahamLedger @OANN You wont drop 5 billion? How bout we lose 5 billion in trade. That will help pay for it. 		How does a closed border, without a wall, not increase illegal immigration?
@LindseyGrahamSC Lol like selling a car on Craigslist. The buyer knows you need to sell the car to pay bills. Your ex wife gets the car on Jan.3 and there is no way to sell it. So you tell the guy you wont take any less than 2000 over blue book value		The american people dont want a #Wall
@beachlove101 @PatHamel5 @AcademicResist @ChadPergram Not off the top of my head. Hard to find because house is so much bigger. Senators, i can think of Collins and Minchin in the Kavanaugh confirmation. McCain in the healthcare repel.

No more lobbying money, no more superpacs. Make congress accountable to people again, not big businesses and lobbying groups. At the end of the day, obstruction has its place..

@PatHamel5 @beachlove101 @AcademicResist @ChadPergram So republicans and democrats both obstruct. I believe those statements are hypocritical, borderline unconstitutional. Being a hypocrite is a virtue on the hill. Obama said marriage was between a man and woman. Trump said Mexico would pay for the wall. Hypocrites, the lot
@R0ckadile @YourAuntHilda @Zoftwarz @arlenparsa @ChadPergram Looks like vacations are always paid for by the President, but the 200 workers that follow are paid by the state.

@YourAuntHilda @Zoftwarz @arlenparsa @ChadPergram Only official state business is paid for during a shut down. Visiting soldiers would be official state business. Taking a vacation is not off. Business. He would have to accomidate himself and secret service out of pocket during a shut down.
