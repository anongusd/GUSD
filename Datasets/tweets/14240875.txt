AFSCME members stand for an America where everyone’s rights and freedoms are protected, where women are respected and empowered, where working people have a voice on the job and a seat at the table.
We don’t need another justice who will do the bidding of billionaires and rig the rules of our economy and our democracy. #StopKavanaugh
Kavanaugh is a cheerleader for union-busting, having endorsed one employer’s scheme to set up a sham, dummy corporation simply for the purpose of avoiding negotiating a fair contract with its workers.
Brett Kavanaugh would make a pro-corporate court even more extreme. It would make it even harder for working people – and working women especially – to get a fair hearing and access to justice.
Two months ago, in Janus v. AFSCME, SCOTUS overturned 41 years of precedent to undermine the freedom of public service workers to stand together in a strong union.

Only the states of California, Washington, Minnesota and the U.S. military have any heat standards in place to protect workers. It’s time for @OSHA_DOL to take action and protect all U.S. workers from extreme heat.
260,000 U.S. workers are at risk of heat-related illnesses and deaths with no standard in place to protect them. Along with our partners, we’re urging @OSHA_DOL to enact national heat stress protections that would keep our workers safe. #BeatTheHeat
From 1992 through 2016, exposure to excessive environmental heat killed 783 U.S. workers and seriously injured nearly 70,000. With accelerating climate change, worker injuries and deaths due to excessive heat exposure are projected to increase in the coming years. #BeatTheHeat

AFSCME can play a part in holding our state and local governments accountable for addressing and stopping harassment — Secretary-Treasurer Elissa McBride #timesup #metoo #SafeWorkplaces
Workers deserve #SafeWorkplaces. Workers deserve respect. Workers deserve to be heard. Workers deserve to be able to do their jobs and live their lives without fear. #YouDeserveBetter
Harassment is a symptom of a broader problem of gender inequality and power — @FGossGraves @nwlc #timesup  #metoo #SafeWorkplaces
There is no reason that harassment should be so embedded in some sectors of the workforce — @nwlc @FGossGraves @onefairwage #timesup #metoo #SafeWorkplaces https://t.co/p4cJ1AXzI7
#SafeWorkplaces free from sexual harassment start with management playing a proactive role in creating safe, respectful and inclusive workplaces. #NoMoreHarassment #timesup #metoo
It is essential that there is a clear and transparent process for handling reports of harassment. If people don't trust the process to be fair, they won't use it — @FGossGraves @nwlc #timesup #metoo #SafeWorkplaces
The union can be a helpful resource to make sure due process happens when both the accuser and accused are represented by the same steward — @lizshuler @AFLCIO #metoo #timesup #SafeWorkplaces
