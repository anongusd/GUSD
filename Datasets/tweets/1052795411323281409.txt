Erdayastronaut NASASpaceflight JeromeJaccard Robotbeat alan1bernard Yup. Actually, the only significant design element in common with early Atlas is stainless steel &amp; we‚Äôre using a different alloy mix. I super ‚ô•Ô∏è 300 Series Stainless!
Erdayastronaut JeromeJaccard Robotbeat alan1bernard While there are some material similarities, Starship is very different from the Atlas design
Erdayastronaut JeromeJaccard Robotbeat alan1bernard Stainless steel is correct, but different mixture of alloys &amp; new architecture. Unlike Atlas, Starship is buckling stable on launchpad even when unpressurized.
