@edhenry If your interview with Rep Price is indicative of the upcoming debate on border security, why bother. The democrats are a bunch of veteran swamp dwellers who can't even answer a simple yes or no question about whether they believe a wall is immoral.

@Louise_FixedIt @realDonaldTrump I seriously doubt that anyone who is terminally ill feels as if they are "rich".

@RepDeSantis @INHOC478 Agree, how is that the servants of the people can be above the law that they impose on us.
@ZozzoraCarmine @carold501 The proverbial slippery slope, this is going to get painful real quick.
@jeanniemcbride Same study says that 40% of white men also arrested by 23, what's happening to our society?
@ZozzoraCarmine @carold501 Yep, it's a house of cards of Obama's making, what's that he says about not letting a crisis go to waste?
@ZozzoraCarmine @carold501 There's going to be lots of people working multiple part time jobs.

@SenRandPaul @reason I agree with you, and have told my rep Rob Wittman so. He believes sequester is hitting defense too hard.
@RobWittman Why hasn't the # of civilians decreased from the # in 1982? They have PCs now, so each one should be more productive.
@RobWittman Most of who are retired military, bring back the double dipping restrictions.
@RobWittman They can start by eliminating 1/2 of the bloated civilian staff in the Pentagon.
@RobWittman Agree, but I believe there is room to cut the defense budget without hurting uniformed personnel.
@RobWittman I share those concerns, but they are dwarfed by the concerns over out of control spending which will hurt our defense even more.
@RobWittman @twitter How do feel about the budget deal? I think we're better off leaving the sequester in place as is.
@PRyan Leaving the sequester in place as is reduces the deficit even more though, right?
@seanhannity @PRyan How is this deal better than just leaving the sequester in place?
@jeanniemcbride Maybe, he is after all deranged.

Heading out to vote for Ken Cuccinelli this morning.
@putinwatch The Tea Party movement is decidedly libertarian.
@putinwatch I think you're painting libertarians, or people who call themselves libertarian, with a broad brush.
@putinwatch Libertarians are for smaller gov't, personal responsibility and individual freedom. Sounds pretty conservative to me.
@PRyan Why don't Dems just admit that they are taking us down the road to socialism. They will fail when Americans wake up.
GOP tried to stop Obamacare, best thing to do now is let it fail. People will be hurt, but it might be the only way they'll learn.
@RepRichHudson @HouseCommerce Why does the gov't get to dictate what should be covered? People should be able to make choices.
@KatiePavlich What about the part "as long as it conforms to what we said it should cover"?
@GeneMcVay A bunch of underworked overpaid bureaucrats, 50% can be eliminated without missing a beat.
@putinwatch They want to crap all over the system that made them rich in the first place. Hypocrites.
@putinwatch So just another rich liberal who thinks socialism is the cure for everything.
@putinwatch Who is he?
@GeneMcVay Competition and accountability.
@Truthh4 Good for you 4, maintain that perspective and you will do well.
@peterjohnsonjr @foxandfriends I think they should ask former POWs how important faith was to them while in captivity. PC run amuck!
@RepRichHudson @CBSNews Where did they find this clueless 12%?
@DanaPerino @RobertGBeckel They need him to keep carrying their water on The Five.
@Varneyco Banks only did what gov't wanted them to do, make it easy for more people to buy homes. Blame lies with stupid regulations.
@ShannonBream @FoxNews @ANHQDC All they did was postpone, you'll be reporting the same story in 2 months. Cowards.
@marklevinshow The cowboy poetry lover, as long as it's with our money.
We need entitlement reform now; means testing, increase the eligibility age, before we ruin the country for next generation(s).
@annakooiman @ffweekend Be careful.
@FBNStossel Beckel said wait until interest payments are so large they consume most of budget to act. Why wait?
@megynkelly This non-issue is just another Obama distraction
@deneenborelli DOE was established to reduce our dependence on foreign oil, they have failed. Shut them down.
@CatoInstitute How many federal civilian employees compared to 1982? Didn't have PCs then, so # should be lower.
@WCCBNewsRising @RepRichHudson @tbates97 Do you have any suggestions on entitlement reform?
@putinwatch @davidwebbshow He just picked up a new follower.
@marklevinshow You'd think they'd get tired of being Obama's bitch. Socialism here we come.
@GeneMcVay @foxandfriends When you're in a hole you need to stop digging.
@RobWittman Business as usual, spend more $ we don't have. Give rich senator's widow $174K and pay folks for not working. Stupid!
@BretBaier So they're upset because things aren't operating as usual in DC? Too bad, that's why Cruz was elected.
@SenRandPaul @CNNsotu Absolutely, the interest payments on the debt consume more of the budget each year.
@JayRome_87 Get after it today! Give them another lesson in grown man football.
@Truthh4 How's the knee? Praying it's not serious. Same for 82 and 86.
@Tyknowsfootball Just watched your interview on Stossel, very impressive.
@MikeMinor36 Good luck tonight.
Golf courses in this area are crowded with non-essential gov't workers, guess they're not too worried about not getting a paycheck.
@Truthh4 A bunch of non-essential Washington bureaucrats get to stay home for a couple of days. They'll eventually get paid for it.
@ShannonBream @ANHQDC If that's what it takes, shut it down!
@ShannonBream @FoxNews Sounds like a bailout to me, how much is taxpayer funded and how much is private?
@DanaPerino If gov't shuts down, do military retirees still get paid?
@MarkRicht Congratulations on a great victory coach. Go Dawgs!!
@KrisMedlen54 Great performance last night, looks like you're ready for the playoffs.  Go Braves!!
@RealBenCarson Just caught your interview on FNC with Shannon Bream, like the Alamo analogy.  Keep up the fight.
@IngrahamAngle @RepMoBrooks I agree, the man's hypocrisy knows no bounds.
A good liberal believes socialism has always failed  because the right people weren't in charge. In reality, there are no right people.
