With all the attempts to pass bathroom bills out of a false sense of danger...I imagine it would be incredibly efficient. https://t.co/wB6FGJKcBq
@KarolynSpeaking Fear, brimstone and fire. I grew up in a very Evangelical home and any form of feminity was quashed. I have amazing parents though. I suppose it was the desire to conform and meet societal expectations. In the end faith saved me. I found strength in trust. It was my path home.

If we are going to truly be a great nation, this division must stop. No one is less. No one is more. We all have value. Forgetting that destroys the foundations of freedom and justice. I love my country far too much to see it eroded by segregation.
Serving in the @USMC was one of the most instrumental periods of my life. I grew mentally and learned to face fear. It took courage to come out as a #transgender woman, and I wouldn‚Äôt be the Congressional candidate I am today without all of my life experiences. #TransMilitaryBan

@PoshTheStrwbrry Indeed. When I was @WilliamsSonoma, I led a project to identify new areas for call center expansion to several states and Canada. To entice new businesses, we must address education, infrastructure, incentives, and equality. Oklahoma has a lot to offer and huge growth potential.
@AbbyGraceWriter @Amanda_Kerri Thank you, Abby. I will work to secure funding for Special Education and ESEA Title 1, which will help close budget gaps. I agree wholeheartedly that teacher raises are vital to improving education. I‚Äôm hopeful that OK state legislators will approve a solution soon.

I‚Äôm happy to have witnessed #HB1530 pass the #OKHouse. It was a narrow 52-40 vote, but this is a good step toward advancing #genderpayequality and preventing retaliation for employees inquiring about equal pay. Now, the bill is on to the #OKSenate. #okleg
Q from the floor: If women are paid so much less, why wouldn‚Äôt businesses only hire women to save more money? 		Because it‚Äôs discrimination &amp; super illegal. Also, businesses used to do that A LOT, and it was one of the catalysts behind the #WomensRights movement. 		#OKLeg #HB1530

@TonyinOKC I do appreciate you engaging on this subject. It‚Äôs an important part of future planning for everyone and a difficult issue to resolve.
@TonyinOKC My hope is to find some form of compromise to meet several needs. As medical advancements become available &amp; with the possibility of healthcare for all, its expected that overall health will increase. Life expectancy may be level, but the number of recipients will skew resources.
@TonyinOKC Thank you for sharing your source. While there may be a slight drop of a few months due to opioid related deaths, there is still a significant looming funding issue and growth expected in recipients. All of my proposals are forward-looking. Reactive policy leads to more conflict.
@TonyinOKC Perhaps we could discuss some of your concerns? I am very interested in an ongoing dialog about what will make Oklahoma and America a better place to live. Thanks Tony.
One of the best parts of being active in the conversation to represent a growing and vibrant #Oklahoma is hearing impassioned people share their stories, experiences and hopes. Truly, it‚Äôs been an incredible week. I‚Äôm thankful to be on this journey with you. #OK5
Observing #internationalwomensday we give thanks to all women for their contributions around the world, especially those who are fighting for rights many have already gained. You got this ladies!
Every person is worthy of receiving #kindness. It doesn‚Äôt matter where they‚Äôre from, how they speak, their age, who they love, their education or how much money they have. Everyone deserves to be treated with #dignity.
Of the 9,754 people incarcerated in FY2017 7,328 were nonviolent offenders who have now entered a system where the average sentence spans 31 years. I realize each crime is different and in some cases this is reasonable, but clearly there is a need for #OKJusticeReform
Without #OKJusticeReform, OK is projected to incarcerate an additional 7K Oklahomans over the next 8 years. To do this, the state will spend an additional $1.9B to construct 3 more prisons. It‚Äôs not only the money that‚Äôs concerning, it‚Äôs the human suffering that‚Äôs unacceptable.
@mcafee2012 Ms. Price‚Äôs story was very moving. I‚Äôm glad she was able to speak today and share with the forum. Life without parole was an injustice in her case. There‚Äôs room for compassion in the process, and DA‚Äôs should exercise that option when prosecuting non-violent offenses.
When I studied Criminology as part of my Sociology degree, Criminal Justice was divided into two camps - punishment and rehabilitation. Prisons should not serve as a for-profit business entity. It‚Äôs hard to say that‚Äôs not what‚Äôs happening. What HAS happened in OK is a travesty.
Listening to speakers for criminal justice reform at the OK Capitol. It‚Äôs appalling that Oklahoma is about to over take LA as the state with the highest levels of male incarceration, making OK the state with the highest levels of overall incarceration in the country. #OKleg

Additionally, Prescription coverage needs some serious overhauling. A pill in Canada shouldn‚Äôt cost 15% of what you pay with coverage in the US.
When elected, I will work to find solutions for #healthcare. This means curtailing runaway charges and fees, and working to set schedules for care. If you need a doctor, you should be able to see how much that will cost and what you can opt out of ahead of time.
Statistically, Oklahoma has some of the highest numbers of uninsured residents. The lack of coverage transcends all ethnicities, socioeconomic groups and age. To make matters worse, many county clinics are reducing clinicians. If we are to remain a strong country, health matters.

@springerokc Having a degree in Sociology &amp; by studying criminology, I see areas for improvement in the criminal justice system. Extravagant sentences do little to rehabilitate and the more time in, the higher the chance of recidivism. Non-violent crime shouldn‚Äôt come with decades in prison.
@springerokc Healthcare needs improvement for sure, especially in rural communities. I‚Äôd like to see ideas on strengthening healthcare access. I‚Äôd have to see a single-payer proposal before committing. My hope is to improve on current legislation rather than scrap it, but it‚Äôs a priority.
@springerokc I agree. There are many things to be improved upon. The education crisis in Oklahoma is serious, but primary handled by the state. Congress has fallen short in supporting Title 1 and Special Education onligations. Increased funds for those programs would help the state.

@Hi_Dr_Nick Good question, Nick. My hope is that we can come together as a nation and create viable change. I for one, don‚Äôt feel adding armed protector to a teachers job description is the best course of action. If we give anything to Oklahoma teachers, it should be raises &amp; resources.

Creating a govt. program to put guns in schools is not as good of an idea as using badge access. It works for businesses and the technology is readily available. Our teachers are working incredibly hard with little resources as is. Too much room for error. #NeverAgain https://t.co/CdAOVKVoaX
When elected, I will put YOU, the American people and our guests, first in every meeting, committee, program, and vote. You, your safety and your livelihood are my only concern.
While some may say banning weapons is the answer, I believe they are only part of a bigger issue. That's why I proposed a comprehensive plan. My job as a candidate is to ensure legislation meets the need of society as a whole, no matter your age, sex, ethnicity, orientation, etc.
Listening to #ParklandStudentsSpeak, I think back to all the things I've seen. As an Oklahoman, I was affected by the Edmond Postal Massacre and the Oklahoma City bombing. Then there was Columbine, 9/11, Virginia Tech, and Sandy Hook and more. The violence affects us all.

@Robwhite010 Hi, Robbie. I‚Äôd like to invite you to review my platform and positions. I‚Äôd be happy to answer questions you may have. Take care! https://t.co/5d6AAaPSRq
@usaodrovers Sorry I missed this event. As a diversity candidate, I would have been interested in attending. Perhaps I‚Äôll catch the next one.
@TonyinOKC @s_r_s @lennonpatton @EdBlauLaw Oops. Please forgive the typo. I had a thought and went back to change it and predictive text got me.
@MadiLAlexander @TonyinOKC @lennonpatton @EdBlauLaw Hello, Madi and Tony. For my position I would say there‚Äôs already a precedent with Roe v. Wade, &amp; I support the rights of women. I really wish abortion didn‚Äôt exist, but I understand the risks to women‚Äôs health without it. On gun control, here is my plan https://t.co/uGk5x6JDHN
@TonyinOKC @s_r_s @lennonpatton @EdBlauLaw Hi Tony. Thank you for considering me as a an option. The candidates are all different and have different strengths. I invite you to review my social media presence and learn as much as you can. I can also answer questions to make your decision easier.

Despite how anyone feels about those taking part in rallies against gun violence, 17 people were killed in Parkland and thousands more die each year in gun related events. Lawmakers must revisit gun legislation and find solutions that protect the public interest. #NeverAgain

Time for #TidBitTuesday.		Last September, I learned a great deal about emergency preparedness when I went to Houston to hire and train responders for the Hurricane Harvey response. In the #OK5 election, I'm the only candidate to have earned a HAZWOPER (Hazard Ops.) certification.
On this day and everyday, do not be discouraged. The forces of love and light continue to fight beside you on your behalf. You are never alone, even in the hard times.
@jbarro It is a horrible tragedy. Action must be taken to thwart this from happening again and other related acts of gun violence. I have actual ideas to get us there.
@foxandfriends Projects like this one have me hopeful for the future. #Hyperloop
@armyofskeletons @KOSURadio @oksenategop That‚Äôs what I‚Äôve been saying for years. I have a teen and it‚Äôs incredibly frustrating to sit down to do homework and not have a textbook because there aren‚Äôt enough. I had to send a note to school to request one be allowed to be checked out of class. Ridiculous!
@oufenix @stevelackmeyer Indeed. When teachers are panhandling for money to buy school supplies, it‚Äôs evident that funding allocations need to be adjusted.
@cshelden If it were available, I‚Äôd much rather see that invested in teachers and/or textbooks.
@AdamGoodrich33 @KOSURadio @oksenategop A really good audit would be better.
@brandt_brickell @KOSURadio I‚Äôd be interested in hearing your ideas, Brandt.
@Glosssymom @CarrieBlumert üëÜ Mhmm. Restraint is a beautiful talent.
@KandyceMitchell @ChefJoelWingate Very nice!

@hideoutartokc Nice. I like this one.
@MizzLadyja I wish you better days ahead :)
@picassocafe Came in this past Saturday and had a great time. Thank you!
@realDonaldTrump You had authorization to impose Russian sanctions, and you yielded your authority to send a direct signal. What happens now, will be a reflection on your presidency.
@Eve23144819 @r_bart12 @ChrisMurphyCT We are all equal, and we have to get people to realize that and keep programs that help those without access to services the upper and middle classes can afford. Right now in the proposed 2019 budget, there's massive cut to social services, and it's wrong.
@SpencerLenox @Twitter That would be a useful option.
@DayaShadowfax Cheer up Girl. Welcome the good into your life. Be open to the amazing.
@_tiptoeing_ @cathleendecker @PhilipRucker I can accept that. I‚Äôm a small fish in a new pond. I stepped up to run because a lot of people are getting lost in the political shuffle. I‚Äôm bound to stumble, but I‚Äôll listen when people give me feedback. Thank you for reaching out.
@_tiptoeing_ @cathleendecker @PhilipRucker Nope. I‚Äôm running to save lives, and not just from bullets. There are a lot of people who need an advocate. I‚Äôm running for the forgotten. Homeless teens, orphaned kids who‚Äôs parents are locked up for minor drug offenses, and more. Having an idea shouldn‚Äôt brand you with a label.
@geeknik It seems to work.
@OklahomaGW @2020fight Handgun, assault rifle, a real idea would address both crimes and hope to reduce deaths overall.
@LaurelMaisie @JeffreeStar The middle of nowhere is still somewhere. You never know.
@jeff_goldblatt @NOH8Campaign @LoriPaigeStudio I couldn‚Äôt agree more, Jeff. #Equality for everyone
@realDonaldTrump Please turn off the television. We have so much work to do in order to heal our country right now. People need ideas and action.

@jemelehill @RickRoss Oh yeah, you‚Äôve been missing out. The Louisiana Rub is really good too.
@GiffordsCourage You both are incredibly inspiring, and I agree with you. I have kids in school. I couldn‚Äôt bear to lose them. I‚Äôm distributing an idea for those who are looking for solutions and who are ready to fight in the hope that we can make our world a safer place. https://t.co/uGk5x6JDHN
@BetoORourke And we need to put books back in backpacks, for the students and the parents to help them learn together.
@politico More guns in schools is not the answer.
@glaad @SkidmoreCollege My God Hallelujah!! Yes please!!
@r_bart12 @ChrisMurphyCT Right now, I‚Äôm focusing on creating a dialog on gun laws and what we can actually do within the law. There‚Äôs a solution that works, but we have to work together to get there.
@r_bart12 @ChrisMurphyCT Yes, it‚Äôs messed up, and there‚Äôs more to do even still. Congress must stop Trump from slashing aid to programs like Meals on Wheels and housing for the disabled, ending the Legal Services Corporation, which provides legal service for lower class citizens. We have to be vigilant.
@tayloryon_ You all are so inspiring. I‚Äôm with you, and I won‚Äôt be backing down. #NeverAgain
@RheaButcher @Pharrell Right?!
@rustyrockets Nice, Russell. You do radiate a special kind of universal energy.
@davidhogg111 I will never forget, David. I‚Äôm sure those who have gone before us are proud of all of you for speaking up and working to create change. Thank you for what you are doing.
@thehill That‚Äôs why my proposal is self-funded.
@votevets @MarlerMorris @marcorubio We must listen to these brave young adults. Thank you for supporting veteran candidates!
@mradamscott Adam. I have an idea if you‚Äôre interested in learning more. https://t.co/uGk5x6JDHN
@Belettuce @Oil_vampire @ChrisMurphyCT In order to make real change we have elevate those with leadership capability. The ones who have faced real hardship - discrimination, joblessness, homelessness, hunger, pain &amp; loneliness. These are the people who see what the world needs. They have lived it and they want better.
@Belettuce @Oil_vampire @ChrisMurphyCT I feel that we live in fleeting moments because we are moving quickly with little accountability. The need for recognition and quick rewards have become important, but that‚Äôs not what matters. People matter. Slogans don‚Äôt put food on the table, or teach a child to read.
@joshgad Josh, I‚Äôm going to fight for change. I‚Äôm going to fight for those who are underrepresented. I‚Äôm going to be here for those who need someone to listen to them.
@Makeusagreat3 @Belettuce @ChrisMurphyCT You‚Äôre right. Hearts are much more difficult to mend. Perhaps if we start leading with compassion and listening to those suffering the world will begin to heal. We are made to carry each other‚Äôs burdens. It‚Äôs time we remembered that.
@Oil_vampire @Belettuce @ChrisMurphyCT I‚Äôm not sure I‚Äôd agree with society as a whole being more dysfunctional everyday. A lot of our perceptions are influenced by what we take in, but you are right that we have to look at behavior, as well as, developing resources to prevent these horrendous acts.
@Belettuce @ChrisMurphyCT Absolutely. I have several issues listed on my site in order to share my thoughts behind them. I‚Äôm also happy to answer questions you may have. I also listen to ideas :)
@TNtinman @ChrisMurphyCT @GOP @TheDemocrats Thanks! Probably too general (we - all Americans)
@ZachHibshman @StormResist I‚Äôm so very sorry this happened to you, Zach. I too have a son in school about your age. I will do whatever I can to drive a conversation to prevent this from happening again.
@cathleendecker @PhilipRucker Hi Cathleen. Would you be interested in discussing an idea to improve our current system? https://t.co/uGk5x6JDHN
@RepDonBeyer @MarlerMorris Hi, Don. Would you be interested in discussing an idea that will drive change and improve the overall process?
@Belettuce @ChrisMurphyCT You‚Äôre right. It‚Äôs something that‚Äôs been put off. I‚Äôm running to make a change, AND I have a plan to reduce the violence. https://t.co/uGk5x6JDHN
@ChrisMurphyCT We should have acted before they felt compelled to demand action.
@foxandfriends @ToddRokita If the @GOP were truly passionate about tax-free bonuses, the CRUMBS Act would extend beyond 2018 and cover more than the recent bonuses. This is simply a political tactic to avoid getting clobbered in the midterm elections. #FakeLeadership #FlipItBlue @OklaCountyDemos
@funder Nyet Comrade. America is my beloved, and I‚Äôm with my beloved.
@HouseDemocrats These dystopian measures have to stop. We need to increase educational opportunities not decrease opportunities.

@AydianDowling How amazing. Congratulations üéâüéàüçæ
@jondirocco He asks us to trust him and his ways while striving to take care of our neighbors. When we start focus on healing instead of judging, we will begin moving forward.
@koconews I hope the victims recover quickly.
@BillGates Humans are amazing beings. So much good left to be discovered. I‚Äôm hopeful.
@OKCNightCourt That‚Äôs unfortunate. We need to have a discussion on this issue.
@jclement4maine I‚Äôm ready to work with those who are motivated and idealistic. They are our future, and we must clear a path for them.

@imwithzer Yeah, @metaviv‚Äôs theory is freaky scary. Plausible and threatening.
@liberalwhisper I still have reservations. Why does the plan extend the number of years a person can serve in the legislature? Also, it creates another poorly defined govt. agency. Why? I would love to give teachers a raise, but I wonder if this is really the best course of action.

@Grace_Durbin At the moment SB1012, which is in the Senate Education Committee right now. It‚Äôs a scientifically flawed bill and does little to educate our youth.

@Grace_Durbin I‚Äôm someone who believes in Jesus Christ, but that wouldn‚Äôt give me the right to legislate against the beliefs of others or grant Christians special rights. I believe legislators should govern with compassion and humility, based on scientific and proven social principles.
@kim_querry Hi Kim. I wanted to reach out to you about a story you covered last year, https://t.co/U09u0vlR14 I was looking for a follow up online to see if the funds had been repaid, but didn‚Äôt see one. Will you be covering the story about repayment? Thank you. EB
@Bhayes72 Yes, as a state we have governance issues. I‚Äôm not a fan of the finger pointing. It would be great if someone stood up and said, ‚Äúyep, we messed up‚Äù. I quit buying lottery tickets when the money was diverted to other funds and the state was ordered to pay it back to the Edu fund.
@MNmMath So we‚Äôre putting the blame on out of state wind energy producers? Come on Frank. We need to raise teacher salary and do more for schools, but do legislators really need eligibility extensions from 12 to 16 years? We want accountability.
@Bhayes72 It‚Äôs hard to even get in the door to meetings if your not part of the system. I learned this quickly when I announced that I will be running this year. Resistance to common folk is real.
@Wootowndad Politicians also extended their opportunity to serve by 4 years. Teacher pay needs to be raised for sure. Still no mechanism for accountability.
@mpswardogs Like when we bought all those lottery tickets? It‚Äôs a governance and accountability issue too.
@Bhayes72 I‚Äôm really surprised there‚Äôs very little discussion on how the plan adds 4 year‚Äôs of eligibility to the lifespan of politicians in Oklahoma. We often talk so much about career politicians and here we go adding time.

@stocktonduvall The freedom to express one's self in speech is fundamental to a healthy society. Hence the very first amendment. When we falter under outside pressure to grant an equal voice to any member of society, we risk our Union.
@stocktonduvall Institutions of higher learning are the bedrock of diverse thought. In these places, we must offer a platform for any voice that wishes to share ideas, facts, theories, and stories. For in those moments we learn more about ourselves than we might hope to learn on our own.
@stocktonduvall Hello Stockton. Thank you for your succinct words. When I heard what had transpired this week, I began planning how to reach out to you. As someone who has experienced hostile opposition, I commend you for your tact. My goal in reaching out you was encouragement.
@ABCWorldNews I still like the idea of a #PeaceParade on 11/11/18 to celebrate the end of WWI, but only if we can coordinate with the other Allied countries from the war. Send a global message to endorse peace in times of rising global tensions. That would be an amazing feat of humanity.

@BravenakBlog I'm not certain it was the bragging, but there is certainly some tail wagging the dog going on. The timing of the memo was certainly suspicious.
@charlessellsokc If we did one, we'd have to do it as a global community in partnership with England, Russia, France, and others to celebrate peace. If the others didn't wish to participate, the idea would be moot. With everything going on now, it would be nice to have a #PeaceParade. #OK5
If you're in need of encouragement, remember what you are - a miracle. https://t.co/QMIHm3HMdJ
@charlessellsokc If we had a parade, focus on ending WWI. I think it would be absolutely amazing if all the other Allies could coordinate something in their respective countries. Could you imagine celebrating peace on 1 day around the world 2GTHER. That's no easy feat, but think of the humanity.
@charlessellsokc Hi Charles. It's true we aren't a military state, but we haven't been doing right by the troops. Heck, you don't even see the fallen come home anymore. It's been 17 years since we sent troops to Afghanistan. Are we so afraid to show our support for those pledged to die for us?
@CaseyPregent1 @koconews @KOCOMaggie @LtGovToddLamb Also, you can't end "chain migration" it's not an actual program or policy. For anyone to say they're going to end chain migration shows how little they understand how society works. You can't stop people from seeking opportunity. That's ridiculous.
@CaseyPregent1 @koconews @KOCOMaggie @LtGovToddLamb One of my brother and I's best friends immigrated to the USA with his family from Brazil as kids. It took them forever to earn citizenship, but they all did what was necessary. I think if you've been here and have contributed, there needs to be more care around the next steps.
@CaseyPregent1 @koconews @KOCOMaggie @LtGovToddLamb Dreamers came here as kids and shouldn't have progeny elsewhere, but aunts, uncles, cousins, etc. would need to follow the legal immigration process. I don't like unchecked immigration, but sometimes you gotta do what you gotta do for safety. I get that.

The more I think about a #MilitaryParade, I think it would be good for military morale. This year's Veteran's Day (11/11) marks the 100th anniversary of the end of WWI, and that IS something worth celebrating. PEACE ‚úåÔ∏èis never overrated.
@RonaHayes @jeffsessions @FBI Oh Heavens No!! That's a very drastic retort. The @FBI is one of the most important agencies in our nation.

@vk3179 @SteveWestly @GOP Hi, Vincent! We're working on changing representation in OK this year. It will be a challenge, but it's certainly time to change course.
@marizzlefosho @okea Sure they do. Oklahoma hasn't done right by teachers. In addition to raises, schools also need money for textbooks and building repairs. I'm hopeful a resolution will come to pass and soon.
@kayceeward @LilUziTerv @NiallCrick @usaosoccer @loganlewissss @_NathanKing__ @braxton_odell üëç Congratulations Kaycee!
@shrum_dave @ssbe83 @BravenakBlog It's a new day, a new year, Dave. You never know where lightning will strike. You're just outside my district, but I need to hear from all my Oklahoma neighbors to move us forward. https://t.co/a5KmA2reYL
@janucristi @jimtankersley Yeah, we definitely have to fix our public school budgets and quick.
@mmsbulldog70 Very Nice! Congratulations Aidan üëç
@hubbysaidno That's what I said too!
@WanderHack @TheELYYT Welcome! We're happy to have you, and we hope you like it here.

@FBIOklahomaCity @EPCSheriff My deepest condolences to the family of Deputy Flick and to his brothers and sisters in service.
Excuse me, @GovMaryFallin. Oklahoma has passed bonds, brought in the lottery, cut services, closed govt facilities and more. Yes we need to address budget shortfalls, but what is more important is budget accountability. You can spin words, but you can't spend them. #ok5 #OKleg
Any moment now, @GovMaryFallin will be making her last #StateOfTheState address. I'm hoping there is good news for the next governor to draw upon. Fingers crossed for future progress in Oklahoma. #OK5

@charlessellsokc It's the right thing to do. So we keep working on progress.  Every inch closer is a step in the direction we need to go.
@priusjames @kainazamaria @sarahkliff It's actually from today. It's hard to keep the newspaper in good shape with a house full of pancake and syrup-filled kids in the AM. Most of the paper didn't survive üòå
@joepabike @PressSec From my experience analyzing compensation and benefits this has been true. An increase is usually tied to high attrition or a market wage analysis showing a loss in competitive advantage. Spectrum cites #NetNeutrality. Makes me curious about their 12 to 36 month growth plans.
Surely then the administration would take no issue with raising the #minimumwage? It's been $7.25 since 2009. After all, even Mr. Rutledge, CEO of Spectrum, stated that a higher minimum wage helps the employee and the country. Its time to have a new congressional debate. #OK5 https://t.co/FlNlYKPuFo

@kainazamaria @sarahkliff The issue extends beyond the federal level. In rural OK, the Oklahoma State Dept. of Health will cut 150 positions at community health centers by March due to money mismanagement, 43 of which are RN's. In some counties, this is the only healthcare provider. #OK5 It's not right. https://t.co/hyBBHFVCFe
@wsuares Our system is certainly falling short of expectation. My fear is that people will accept the situation as normal if a solution isn't implemented. The newly elected this November must hit the ground running on education from day one. So much of the future depends on viable change.
@PC1170 I can actually feel my blood boiling while reading this article. I cannot stand judges who fail to protect our young. It's outrageous. I'm üò°üò°
@shrum_dave @SheStillResists @MollyJongFast The trying times are stepping stools for tomorrow's triumphs. There is still hope.
@a_chandler Agreed. Increasing our inventory puts pressure on other nations to attempt to match our offensive capability. It's not a recipe for success, nor is it fiscally responsible.
@IndepVote It breaks my heart to see teachers panhandling for school supplies, schools going to 4 days a week &amp; programs being cut. I remember last year when my teen needed help on his homework, &amp; I asked him for his textbook, only to learn the school couldn't afford books. It's not right.
Regrettably, this is what the @GOP and @SpeakerRyan identify as an economic success. ($1.50 a week) I'm sorry. I believe we could be doing so much better.  #FlipTheHouse #BlueWave #OKCD5 https://t.co/zDev9Pxfcz

@richard77710970 @koconews This is a very important election year. We have a lot of work to do in order get on that stable path forward, but it can be done. Have you reached out to the candidates? I know they want to listen to people. I'm listening.
@KnuckleJunction I hope it wasn't all bad. The younger part of my life was lived in Lawton - I get it. The state is more diverse than it may appear from Ft. Sill. Have a safe trip to your next adventure. Best of luck to you, Luke.

@kfor @11drewwright I'm so sorry for your loss Drew. Nothing but faith can mend a wound so very deep that causes severe pain daily. At a time like this we should take comfort in Christ's words from John 14:1-4 "Do not let your hearts be troubled -"

@mattvs86 @PRyan It's not scientific, it's a social poll. üëç
@PRyan I've been taking polls and there is very little "trickling down". It's a shame the benefits to working people expire so quickly. #Congress would address #MinimumWage if you want to help PEOPLE. The last increase was 2009.
I'm truly heartbroken as yet another school shooting has taken place in LA. Today a girl shot a boy in the head and another girl in the stomach. I remember the broken hearts of youth. It...hurts, but it does not give you the right to take a life. Let the pain go. It gets better.

@raybaxter95 I believe level of usage is an issue best left to the states; however, I do feel Cannabis is improperly listed as a Schedule I drug since there are now medical uses in the US. I would hope to amend the Controlled Substances Act &amp; allow dispensaries access to the financial system.

@daveweigel Ahh UHF! I don't know how many times my little brother and I watched this movie as kids. 		I can certainly see a correlation to the current state of politics. Good thing I know how to use a mop as well.
@Jeffbal91 I believe recreational usage is an issue best left to the states; however, I do feel Cannabis is improperly listed as a Schedule I drug, since there are now medical uses in the US. Thus, I would seek to decriminalize marijuana and allow dispensaries access to the financial system
@DennisMaley1 Hello, Dennis. Yes, I am a registered Democrat.

@burlap1337 @KaputRose You could check out my campaign to challenge Rep. Russell. I won't block you. I need to hear what you have to say as a Representative. Come join in the conversation.
@PropMan_ You could select new representation. I mean, everyday Oklahomans have a choice this year at the polls. Have you seen my campaign?
It's time for #TidBitTuesday - My mother is a foreign born American who was fluent in German.  When I was in High School she helped me study German for 3 years.  In college, German wasn't an option so I studies Mandarin instead, and I got a 88/B.  I dig languages &amp; cultures.

@JimInhofe Well, I read the bill and the verbiage is questionable. You are requiring anyone who performs the procedure to ensure the child survives regardless. Causing a child, product of incest or rape, to be born. Who is to take care of the baby then? Does the victim pay the ICU cost?
@933JAKEFM Right?!
On minimum wage, the take home is $1,108 dollars a month after SS and Medicare. The avg. cost of an apartment in OKC is $704. That leaves people working FT at $7.25 an hour with $404 dollars for everything else. $404 is the error code of Oklahoma's working poor. We can do better!

This horrific atrocity must not be allowed to happen again, ever. Every life has value. Every soul is divine. Today, we remember the cost of silence. We will never forget.
Today is #InternationalHolocaustRemembranceDay. It serves as a reminder to stand against the corruption of any state under leadership that deems any class of people as "undesirable". Under the Third Reich, 6M Jews, people of color, LGBT &amp; more were systematically murdered.
@jmandese @marcorubio You are correct, Joe. Tax breaks are one time injections. Then, it's up to the company leadership to determine how that $ is used. A sustained economic plan of growth would increase the minimum wage, as those earning this amount are the most likely to reinvest it quickly.
Woohoo! Good game OKC. üèÄThunder 121 over Wizards 112
@NationalNOW Yes we are! #ElysabethForOK
@GeorgeTakei ü§£ now I need some fries üçü while I digest this food for thought.
Oklahomans want new leadership. We want our representatives to communicate with the public. We need our concerns and ideas to be heard and addressed. All voices must be considered valid. When this doesn't happen, Oklahomans look for new representation. Are you ready? https://t.co/oidOfPEuyj
@owlsong108 @jeffmyers01 @thehill It's true.
@abqDean Oklahomans are amazing people. There's no place like home.
@BradJourdan Imagine @neiltyson coming to you through a device teaching you about Physical Science, Imagine having other charismatic leaders teaching about math, history, etc. We have to explore how technology can help the modern student, and stop using the Industrial Rev.. school system.
@BradJourdan Thre are several advantages for teachers as well. Teachers will act more as facilitators and mentors. Running experiments and holding open discussions. Additionally, we could ensure that high-quality learning happens in every school system.
@BradJourdan As an adult educator, I have designed, developed and delivered using several different methods. The 1 that is the most readily received - interactive learning (eLearning).		If we are going to educate with the intent to create intelligent people, we have to move in this direction.
@BradJourdan Young people today have grown up learning by interacting with technology. The current system in the majority of schools doesn't incorporate this into the curriculum. Instead, we insist they sit there quietly and study what's on the board/take notes. It's a foreign concept to them
@BradJourdan I love teachers. I've been one myself in a different setting. People tend to blame "test scores" and "bad teachers" as you say, but that's not the issue with education. The underlying problem is the way the system is designed. We're still running classrooms based off the 1880's.
@LisaBratton2 @KCS_Robinson @KCS_District It looks like class is shaping up nicely.

@swirlOsquirrel I think we're all frustrated with the current political climate in some aspect. That said, we need more people to represent the liberties outlined by the founders for everyone and not only the interests of some. 		By all means, be bold, be heard.
@theMattMarr Arrrrg. This is so frustrating as a believer. Religion is for controlling yourself, not for controlling others. We have to protect people from religious discrimination. It runs counter to the principles of any doctrine and it's doing more harm than good.
@swirlOsquirrel How else should we govern? Our founding principles are vital to a stable America. Without them, we're bound to fall apart. We must maintain high standards to ensure security in a democracy.		BTW - As an HR Professional, I love your purple squirrel photo. :)
@glennlux @mikemitchellnyc @IndivisibleTeam It's incredibly unfortunate, Glenn. In order for government and society to function well, elected officials must keep channels of communication open and participate in a dialog. In this digital age, it is the most efficient way to work as a community. I will keep the lines open.
@pokie3154 It's true. We do have a pop. working for lower wages. Elected officials must ensure people who are doing honest work receive compensation capable of supporting an honest lifestyle. Regrettably, people are being left behind by a system that doesn't value their work. #MinimumWage
@DucksInnaRow @ZuzkaPau @RWPUSA I take issue with any leader who covers up acts of sexual harassment and assault by elected officials. As a Human Resources Professional and candidate for Oklahoma, I will hold elected officials to higher standards than even my employees. We must have trust in our leadership.
@charlessellsokc I agree, Charles. We do need strong leadership in Oklahoma. We need someone who can represent every citizen of our great state and bring civil leadership back to Congress. That's what I intend to do.
@kathrynclare Hi Kathryn. I invite you to follow me as I am running in district 5. I'm strongly in favor of bringing back respect and civility to Congress.
@TerriLynn510 The list is long Terri, but we are determined. We can and will improve upon the shortcomings left by those who came before us.
@AmyFlipping I would have answered you before now, Amy. The silence from our leaders was one of the motivating factors in my decision to run for Congress in District 5. Dialog is key to a functioning government.
@adams4077 Hi Robert. I agree transparency and open dialog is essential to a functioning government. Tim is welcome to join me in changing the way politicians communicate here in district 5, as are you. Happy Monday!
@cody_jeffcoat Hi Cody. Our environment needs protecting. I recently returned to Oklahoma from assisting with Hurrican Harvey efforts, and I'm running for Congress in District 5. I hope you'll connect with me. Happy Monday!

The story of Jorge Garcia from Detroit is so very wrong.
