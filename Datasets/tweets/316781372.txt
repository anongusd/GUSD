President Trump negotiated the return of remains of US soldiers killed in Korea. Up to 200 families will receive the remains of their loved ones who are OUR heroes. Today we salute their sacrifices. All America stands at attention!! https://t.co/09U3iwVMn3
@SteveTungsten I certainly agree!!
My heart feels for these children! They are abused, tortured &amp; killed. About 1 million each year, separated from their families. Interesting how 2 faced politicians cry about 12,000 in AC &amp; overlook these millions who are murdered. Their outrage isn't about rights but about votes https://t.co/zbSCj6Onbp
@marklutchman 1000% correct!  The lefties and blacks would be howling to the high heavens!!
Hot "news"!  New poll shows that almost 70% of Americans feel that political correctness has gone too far!  Really?  Every commonsense American has known that for years. PEOPLE please!! https://t.co/MLZ7HTeYl8
New studies show a decline in IQ. Ppl are asking why. I think parents bring up their children on a diet of TV and video games. Public school system is a gross failure. Children no longer read books or have time to think, given the constant electronic stimulation of their brains. https://t.co/LXZFnyQ8Yq
Today the whole world cheers Donald Trump!  Well, almost. The hypocrites and naysayers kvetch and complain but today the world is much safer than it was a year ago...thanks to President Trump. https://t.co/CnuqztVECI
Just went to the CNN news site, saw stories ragging Trump &amp; the negotiations with N. Korea. I can't believe these bozos would root for Trump to fail, for America to fail. They don't have to like Trump. They just have to NOT work against our Nation's interest. https://t.co/A4f9Kqg2mu
@MEL2AUSA @POTUS A photo is worth a thousand words. Each word says animal.
The media mopheads have spent two weeks bashing our elegant First Lady with wild and insulting speculations. We need to boycott every commercial sponsor on every offending network. Insulting our dignified First Lady is unacceptable! https://t.co/NfXwX8dXlW
June 6, 1944. The beginning of the end of WWII. Today we remember all of those who sacrificed so much that we would be free. But for these sacrifices, today, we might be a German or Japanese colony. Join me in thanking God and thanking the men and women of the US military!! https://t.co/CW5FTFfwMZ
The NFL &amp; some of its clowns seem hellbent on destroying football in America. I spoke at an urban school. 80% of the boys wanted to be pro athletes. 20% wanted to be rappers. ONE wanted to be a teacher. These boys have no realistic Plan B and often wind up in orange jumpsuits. https://t.co/7WRoLh8Q85
US Supreme Court validates religious rights. They ruled FOR the Colorado baker who refused to use his artistry to create a special wedding cake for two men getting married. The decision brings back some balance to the issue of same sex marriage and the rights of all Americans. https://t.co/67ft7YGnLC

Trump placed tariffs on foreign steel &amp; aluminum. Maybe now our once major industries with 100's of thousands of jobs will come back. Free trade decimated steel, aluminum, clothing, manufacturing &amp; more. Finally, somebody looking out for the American worker! It's time! https://t.co/nFgJq6qfTA
A fine dining restaurant in Monterey, California has posted a sign that loud and unruly children will no longer be allowed. REALLY?  Is it necessary to tell adults that there are places where they must control their children? https://t.co/eYnuEbzzyO

Talk about double standards!! Roseanne called a woman a child of ISIS and an ape. Samantha called Ivanka a "feckless c**t". Certainly, slurs of equal magnitude!

The NFL finally read the Nielsen ratings of the games. They saw many Americans chose to turn off the TV when NFL players refused to stand for the National Anthem.
