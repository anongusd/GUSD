Only 15 months until the constitutionally required 2020 census, the U.S. #Census Bureau has no director. Since John Thompson resigned in mid-2017, Deputy Director Ron Jarmin is ‚Äúperforming nonexclusive functions and duties of the director.‚Äù  https://t.co/gwh6IYtdOK.		/11
Age at #marriage rose:  Median age at first marriage is at its oldest level since 1890 ‚Äî 29.8 years for men and 27.8 years for women.  https://t.co/CVN91NDEnb		/10
Money #income of households increased, &amp; racial inequality persisted.  In 2017, real median family income was $61,372. For a household headed by someone who is Black, the comparable median in 2017 was significantly lower at $40,258.   https://t.co/suzJvN1aB9		/9
Legal #immigration has slowed.  In 2017, 1.13m people obtained lawful permanent resident status in the United States (about one-third of one percent of the population).  In 1907, the comparable number was 1.28m. https://t.co/hYSlozoVer .		/8
Illegal immigration numbers fell to 10.7 million in 2016, the lowest number in a decade, due to declining numbers of unauthorized immigrants from Mexico. Meanwhile, Central America has become a more significant source of unauthorized immigrants.  https://t.co/LZAIO1bfMK.  		/7

Number of #abortions declined.  The CDC reported in November that  the number (638K) and rate of abortions  (11.8 per 1000 women of childbearing age) in 2015 decreased to their lowest levels since 2006.  The 2015 data are the most recent available. https://t.co/DZ1RqErnIO		/5
#Births in the U.S. declined again. In 2017 there were 3.86m births, the lowest number since 1987.  The  general fertility rate of 60.3 (births per thousand women of childbearing age) was an all-time low. https://t.co/KxoE0l8Slp. 		4/
