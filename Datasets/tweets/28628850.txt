@JosephJuvenal their loss.
@KaranStJohn ha. a classic. the husband and wife - paul bartel.
@HafizRabbit an absolute classic.
@RAYNERD9 i wanted to love this movie. saw it on screen when it came out and love Peter Weller. but too wacky or something. will try it again
@CAYANCOBRA4 have to check out Green Room.

@DRJasonPiccolo kurt russell's best work in ages.
@wolfiesgirl2011 not a good movie IMO
@spark_show NO. tried too hard to edgy
@ClarenceWhorley @saulnier_jeremy have seen blue ruin. good flick - in which everyone involved is terrible at doing awful things
@Go_Rinto fantastic film.
@RY4NF24 i know
@TheGrandDaddyD true. can't say i enjoyed them.
@byoung2138 a great film in its desire for being nothing more than what it is - a movie about a tire that kills people.
@Man8Music yes. didn't age well, but a classic
@mattobuck no. tried too hard.
@Pugs_4_Trump look up Flesh Gordon
@LittleJoeBig1 all 3 are a bit arch. inclined to be weird
@86coso had the dude from Party of Five and he was psychotic
@STennant she was great
@RealBobKeaton best murder scene in cinema
@ClarenceWhorley yes, they are. written/directed by the same guy.
@jMOTOrist awful film.
@_GarbagePaleKid it shall be. a great film. i would also add Nic's 2009 Bad Lieutenant
@darevsd it tried to be. so it disqualified
i love the cult suggestions. for modern nominations, I would suggest Bone Tomahawk and Brawl in Cell Block 99.  And maybe The Square
@BDub707469 it's terrific.
@xjrh20xx good choice.
@JTiffMAGA fake cult.
@markjduncan33 true. classic.
@kurt_loder you can't find much from any of the players. i've done research on these guys. actor intrigues me
@AZCOP556 excellent
@Garry_Torrance great movie, but disqualified because it stars Jim Carrey
@ShawnHoyer ha. you age yourself
@ejgallagher1 its all bad. but it's about the media. they knew he was a killer, and helped him because it was a good story
@Peteryder2 its' called Dig. Best rock movie.  Jonestown lead is an asshole. got drunk with him.
@Kowalsk35323444 beautiful movie....barry whatshisname.  a great car. speed.
@andre72350454 great flick, nancy allen
@MaryColon no thanks. saw that movie when it came out - terrible!! Greenaway is a hack!
@burtonic probably one of the best films ever made, and a  cult film
@TimWopel yep. any bruce campbell
@sheycampbell absolutely.
@_its_jennifer i think this was Alex Cox's first.  great soundtrack. good choice.
@pools38 of course.
@mhscott16 hell no.
@Garry_Torrance felt it was too contrived.
@fibbermgee_ben that and the Omega man -  2 of Chucks best
@Peteryder2 too mainstream
@cubanobrow absolutely as well as From Beyond.
@daniel640000 i would put cronenbergs other flicks like Scanners, Shivers and Videodrome ahead of it
@DStang73 no, too popular
@Peteryder2 on the fence
@TimTheDad i agree.
@STLLuxuryHomes a fantastic film. when the bag moves.
@TimWopel classic
@KwCollier true
@RealBobKeaton the best
@Peteryder2 agreed
per  Q on the Five today, a cult film is a flick that fits nowhere but is a sick little gem that sticks with u forever. it's not Rocky Horror. It's not Clockwork Orange.  It's Remy Belveaux's  Man Bites Dog. Or the 1988 Dutch version of the Vanishing.

starting to rethink davidson joke. isn't the point that it's a ridiculously absurd thing to say? so when he says it, he knows that its cavalier delivery about such sacrifice is the punchline cuz there's nothing cavalier about that sacrifice. trying to be generous here. thoughts?
@iowahawkblog it would deserve no attention but for the same show reserving reverence for a pop star break up. the contrast - that a celebrity should no longer be the target of the tastelessly irreverent but a vet is fine strikes me, like the Hillary wake, as the joke.

Clearly the New York Times didn't think this through. They're like Jerry Lundegaard from Fargo. By next week they'll be crawling out a window in their underpants.
this is the clue: the Op-ed was done by the Times to undermine both Wapo and Woodward - and Bob knows it. That the Op-ed author claims to be secretly saving the world while exposing that very fact, which sabotages it -  means he doesn't exist. it's the Times. https://t.co/hn5yi2Epch

If Trump wants to find the op-ed writer, all he has to say is this:  "we looked into everyone here so it must be somebody at the Times. In fact it sounds like one from their stable of neutered columnists who said i would lose."
You have 8 hours and 40 minutes before this program blows your mind. Until then, lay out some protective tarp so you don't get your mind all over the furniture. https://t.co/wFvZ3PbFha
How you know @nytimes wrote it: Why would someone trying to work secretly to control Trump's harmful impulses write an op-ed piece for the NYT?  Isn't that exactly the OPPOSITE thing you would do to control his impulses?
Gotta hand it to @nytimes - to trim the sails of Woodward's book &amp; WaPo, &amp; needing web traffic for survival, they type this "anonymous" op-ed! Trump will never find the whiner, cuz he's at 7th and Bway.

whatever wolf did to sanders, will be forgiven -  the same way whatever joy reid did with relish to Coulter, will be as well. The delicious irony: if we were all true misogynists, we'd just become progressives.
the phrase "roasted" is now the line used when you agree with the attack. if a comic had done this to, say Valerie Jarrett, it would be "assaulted." https://t.co/gk0K4L71Bo
michelle wolf reminds us that denigrators of women, are often women who use politics as an excuse for physical ridicule. the media calls that a "roast." if it were a conservative doing so, it would be called misogyny.

its amazing - for their sanity, the first thing this couple says, is "stay away from social media."  these jackasses agreed to find love on a reality show.
The worst thing in the world: to be forced to share a table on a cruise with this lying, vacuous dollar store bag of a couple. #bachelor
Arie is an expert at using modern therapy-speak to protect himself from his spineless behavior. #Bachelor
why doesn't she pour a glass of water on him and walk about and hit the clubs? #Bachelor
the "emptiness" Arie feels is the weight of his own character. #TheBachelor

an  NYC bar owner said this to me: the worst dream is an actor's dream. you can suck, yet no one can convince you otherwise. it breaks your family's heart to see you chase a delusion driven by a thirst for attention. The bar staff were all actors.
Oscars try to explain why movies matter, but you end up hating everything about movies because of the Oscars. it's not fair to the movies, frankly.
worst commercial.  anyone know what that was?
The oscars original reason for being on TV: to see genuine movie stars. now it's a corporate retreat for an industry devoted to non-movie stars virtue signaling. I feel like i'm watching something that I accidentally walked into at a Marriott convention center.
That Eva Marie Saint is in her early 90's tells you about biological equality. No man is that strong, cogent and alert at that age. They're usually dead. She's however, as smart as anyone in that room.

if booing/heckling is a helpful addition to "dialogue," please let us know when to break out the tomatoes.
did the sheriff just admit that he received tips on this killer? (he said "tips)	- and the audience is booing the NRA?
we know the problem with the gun debate: mistrust between two vocal oppositions. A heckling show trial doesn't ameliorate this. it actually makes it worse.
in an audience-driven event, Speakers react to the possibility of applause. that changes debate.

we should send paramedics to our noted leftists right now to see if they expired from an overdose of common sense.
if the old saying is true - that "progressivism is the fear that someone somewhere is making America look good" - this is one of the worst nights ever for progressives.
that was a great moment.
this is building toward a conclusion.

although i have to admit  -i can't concentrate on the speech. Ryan's blue eyes are just too dreamy.
kinda strange - manchin standing. guess someone showed him the poll numbers in WVA. The hall is full of people that are supposed to hate this guy. and they're all cheering. very confused.
the cop stood up. why didn't the democrats yell at him, "no justice no peace?"
i would also point out that no one said that! https://t.co/mGz13I6lWk
i hate these speeches, but the simple clarity of this delivery means that the entire democratic party will need their collective diapers changed after this. some democrats are actually standing. Maybe Mattis threw them a look.

I hereby decree Thursday is a National Strike. leave work and bowl with strangers. There's nothing short pencils can't solve
My point: We should all go bowling. As a country. Pick a day when it's not too busy. Let's all go bowling. Have u ever been mad when u bowl?
screw the NFL. embrace the PBA. Nothing smells better than clean shoes or feels better than a snug fit around 3 fingers. bowlers are heroes.
Pro bowling - something we could all aspire to. everyone could bowl. fat. thin. black. white. ladies. dudes. bald. hairy. that's USA.
this debate is a waste of time. men playing a kids game in funny uniforms and we act like it's meaningful. unlike pro bowling.

@JohnDeVore you know you're dismissal is just asking for a generic "thats why trump won."
@VicBergerIV i think investing in green R and D is paramount. but the answers may run counter to our assumptions. they always are for some reason
@VicBergerIV agree on coal mining. but do think there might be way to mix all this stuff so that one is reduced, while another is increased - naturally.
@VicBergerIV i think if thats the case, then the market will reflect it. right now natural gas and nuclear power might be a path that's greener.
@VicBergerIV but do you want to know why he's against them, or why i am? i just want cheaper renewables. wind farms aren't. they're not the answer IMO
@VicBergerIV also i am drinking. so apologies for responses.but i predict a deal. Due to familial pressure
you know my theory. it's an invitation https://t.co/sk8kVM03Ha
@VicBergerIV it was nonbinding - means trump could have let it go - just done nothing - which might have been politically smarter.
@VicBergerIV and the numbers are nuts. i read the accords projections and costs and its mind blowing. which is why it was nonbinding in the first place
@VicBergerIV he said it was a bad deal, and open to a better one. That's a fair compromise, and will likely lead to one. perhaps after he's gone.
investment in green R&amp;D makes sense. Punitive cost coupled with negligible reduction is a sign no one read the accord documents.
it should be about the best solutions to problems. The accord was the opposite of a solution. it was virtue signaling, not practical acts
U can call us deniers. But U could also try to explain the mechanics of the accord. instead, u assumed peer pressure + guilt would suffice.
climate clerics failed to persuade, cuz their arrogance prevented them from defending flawed economics &amp; climate models. they know it.
