Another comment the likes of which you can hear all day long. Of course if someone said this about black people it‚Äôs racist. So you complain about prejudice but you think you have social impunity?

@SenatorDurbin My liberal pastor wants these cut as well. Although he votes Dem he has seen enough first-hand abuse of these programs. He stopped doing the church food bank drive as the vast majority of people aren‚Äôt in need - just taking advantage of everyone else‚Äôs hard work and charity.
@ABC When he leaves, check for an ‚ÄúI VOTED‚Äù sticker.
@SarahKSilverman Are you just trying to cover your ass with this liberal extremism? Is this all a smoke screen for some poor lobster you molested way back when you were a little boy? You of all people should be so tired of all this witch-hunting and self-righteousness reeking from the left.
@Virgini82855531 @Cernovich Do not make assumptions, ascertain proof, prosecute. 		General media makes assumptions - no biggie it‚Äôs what they do. Trump replies with ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt know for sure‚Äù. Liberal media states ‚ÄúTrump is defending Saudis‚Äù. It‚Äôs the same formula for just about every anti-Trump rhetoric.
@jason_blum why would you apologize for making an innocent and accurate statement? Why do you choose to bow to this era‚Äôs McCarthyism? Bullying tactics by the left to make you believe you are bad - devil‚Äôs best trick.
@Cernovich Two things:		1) Yes, there is ZERO evidence as of now of Saudi involvement.		2) Saudis were involved.
@nypost Absolutely disgusting that she is labeled a racist for doing what she would do to ANYBODY else. Another example of the left propagating social rifts &amp; racial tensions all under the guise of justice. Just creating enmity out of thin air - and destroying lives along the way. Shame.
@GeorgePapa19 @Cernovich @washingtonpost @nytimes Not fake news, but any semblance of objectivity has vanished. Can you really be taken as serious ‚ÄúNews‚Äù when every article, nay, headline is saturated with anti-conservative vitriol. Once you choose sides you must pander; your business depends on it; you have no other client pool
@chelseahandler Lol this was established decades ago: We get a larger voter turn-out on weekdays (when most run errands) than we do on weekends (when most have plans). Weekday vote has proven to show the best turn-outs, but please twist this into some huge conspiracy by the evil republicans.
@RealJamesWoods Equality means being held to the same standards as everyone else, not continuously imploring for special treatment and social immunity - which illustrates not wanting to be an equal member of society. I am an immigrant minority who speaks for #equality, not unmeritted favors.
@mitchellvii @drjanaway why do we talk about this as if it‚Äôs all or nothing - real or fake? Environmental consciousness, conservation, green practices are all good things - and something else the libs exploit and use for political fodder. To what end? Scared people are active people.
@nypost She didn‚Äôt let A MAN into the building. Another example of #MisleadingLiberalMedia riling up unintelligent America by making vile assumptions. Who‚Äôs to say she doesn‚Äôt do that to EVERYONE without a key.
@benshapiro As long as you cry loud enough, protest hard enough, demand bitter enough, you can be anything you want - man, woman, citizen, victim, et. al. Ah, America. Where it doesn‚Äôt matter how lazy you are as long as you complain persistently enough.

@latimes Any grassroots social activism that gains notoriety will eventually grow into this - a big business with it‚Äôs own agenda: gaining headlines/gaining funds. #TimesUp is now no more than McCarthyism. When #Truth is less important than furthering your cause, your cause is worthless.
