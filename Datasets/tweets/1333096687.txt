@Neil818 @TryToTakeIt @delaneytarr @davidhogg111 Maybe it wasnt a big deal for you, but its obviously a big deal for many today. If someone wants to take the risk of leaving unlocked guns in their home fine, but be ready to take responsibilty for it. Hence why I support the parents being held responsible.
@Neil818 @TryToTakeIt @delaneytarr @davidhogg111 I am a Confirmed Catholic. I go to church on Sunday. Ive always been active in my church community. However, you do not have to be religious to be a good person, which the vast majority of people are. People dont take responsibility for their actions anymore and thats the problem
@TryToTakeIt @Neil818 @delaneytarr @davidhogg111 No they arent, My arguement is that the parents are also guilty, along with the kid. Not that the kid is innocent.
@Neil818 @TryToTakeIt @delaneytarr @davidhogg111 I am pro 2A. However, i am also pro responsibilty. You should be responsible for your actions. If you dont lock up your guns, and your kid gets to them and kills someone, the gun owner should be held responsible Its stupid to leave your firearms out where your kid can access them
@TryToTakeIt @Neil818 @delaneytarr @davidhogg111 You get your probationary for a year, and then you get your license if you dont do anything ro get the license taken away. The kid shouldnt have access to their parents weapons without supervision. I think We can agree on that. I dont see why we shouldnt put some laws behind that
@TryToTakeIt @Neil818 @delaneytarr @davidhogg111 I mean, until you are a licensed driver, they have to be. And they are liable for the drivers actions. At least here in NJ, thats how getting your driver's license works. You get a learners permit for at least 6 months, and you need a driver with 3 yrs of experience before
@TryToTakeIt @Neil818 @delaneytarr @davidhogg111 Parent is just as bad. Why did the kid have unsupervised access? Why wasnt the gun locked up? The parent enabled the kid to do it. If the kid didnt have the gun, he wouldnt have done as much damage. No one wants to take responsibility today.
@TryToTakeIt @Neil818 @delaneytarr @davidhogg111 For their actions, i bet you that the vast majority of gun owners would get serious about safely storing their firearms. We shouldnt wait until the kid shoots someone. We should say "if your kid shoots someone witb your firearm, you are liable for their actions." In my eyes, the
@TryToTakeIt @Neil818 @delaneytarr @davidhogg111 Because parenting doesnt exist anymore. I had very strict parents. There was a gun in the house during my childhood. However, i never saw the gun. The gun and its ammo were locked in seperate safes. But, thats not the case in a lot of homes. If the kids parents are responsible
@TryToTakeIt @Neil818 @delaneytarr @davidhogg111 Up tight? I know i would. This would be a hell of a motivator to keep guns away from their children. You cant say that kids getting hold of their parents gun isnt a very common denominator in these shootings.
@TryToTakeIt @Neil818 @delaneytarr @davidhogg111 Is transportation. A gun is made to be as deadly as possible. Be that for self defense or crime. In general, its a stupid idea to let a kid have access to your gun safe. If the parents are liable for their kids actions in that sense, dont you think that they will keep them locked
@TryToTakeIt @Neil818 @delaneytarr @davidhogg111 Yes, i geniunely believe that. However, a parent shouldnt let their kid have access to their firearms without their supervision. If their parents let their kid have access their guns, they and the kid kills someone, the parents should be liable. While cars can kill, the purpose
@Neil818 @TryToTakeIt @delaneytarr @davidhogg111 the owner are dropped. Its not perfect, i know, but its a logical first step.
@Neil818 @TryToTakeIt @delaneytarr @davidhogg111 arent a very responsible gun owner. Maybe we have a time period that the owner has to report it stolen between a crime that is committed. If the person who stole the firearm is not living in the same household, (so a parent cant claim their kid stole it) then the charges against
@Neil818 @TryToTakeIt @delaneytarr @davidhogg111 So, the parents should be charged with the same crime the kid is. Simple as that. If the gun was locked up without the kid being able to access it, the kid wouldnt be able to start shooting. I really dont see the problem there. If you arent able to store your gun safely, you
@Neil818 @TryToTakeIt @delaneytarr @davidhogg111 My proposed solution is not perfect. i understand that. However, the idea of a gun owner being responsible for their guns is not too far fetched. for the school shooting epidemic that this country is facing right now, we tend to find out that the kid got his parents guns.
@TryToTakeIt @Neil818 @delaneytarr @davidhogg111 If its not reported stolen, fine. But i'd be sure as hell reporting it stolen. I feel as if being forced to report a firearm stolen isnt unreasonable. If it was reported stolen, the owner wouldnt be liable. Also, thats a neat ad hominem fallacy you've got there.
@Neil818 @delaneytarr @davidhogg111 Out the owner, but with modernizing records, we could make that much easier. With all these school shootings having the shooter use their parent's guns, they should be punished as well.
@Neil818 @delaneytarr @davidhogg111 With said firearm. Also, this would encourage gun owners to keep their firearms locked up where only they can access them because the responsible gun owners woulnt want to be liable for crimes committed with their firearms. Yes, i understand that it wont always be easy to figure
@Neil818 @delaneytarr @davidhogg111 If it wasnt reported stolen, the owner should be liable for whatever crimes were committed using it. I dont think thats too far fetched honestly. It should be mandatory to report weapons that are stolen. If its not reported the owner should be held liable for any crimes committed

@alt_revere @JesseGuttenberg @sighnatasha An internet service that would be able to have a couple thousand laptops run on it at the same time would cost a lot.

@WeakMighty @KamalaHarris This before it even begins. I would also like to see the Dickey Amendment repealed so we can get funded research from the CDC. Id like to thank you for having a civilized discussion with me on here, you dont see that too often.
@WeakMighty @KamalaHarris I totally agree with you on all of those points. But we cant ignore the fact that most of these shooters (not parkland) are law abiding citizens before they start shooting. I agree that the police dropped the ball on this one, but we need to put measures in place that prevent
@WeakMighty @KamalaHarris If you look at the top of the tweet with the screenshot, you can see that part of it was linked, however i must have not copied it all.
@WeakMighty @KamalaHarris Let me ask you, what should we be doing to combat the gun violence epidemic that we have in this country?
@WeakMighty @KamalaHarris The entire link didnt copy, my bad.	https://t.co/y6Sp9SLDhd
@jerski @EdKrassen At least they allowed one.
@WeakMighty @KamalaHarris I have, many times actually. But again rights arent unlimited. Lets look at the first amendment again, this time religion. If your religion tells you that you should go and kill people, that is not protected under 1A.
@WeakMighty @KamalaHarris 3.) Citizens dont have the unlimited right to own every gun they want. (See response to other part of tweet).	4) We dont want to see 2A repealed. We want common sense regulations on guns such as the license, required insurance ect.
@WeakMighty @KamalaHarris https://t.co/DrKZCRwmAq	1) again your rights arent unlimited.	2) Do you really need a semi automatic rifle for self defense? Surely a handgun or shotgun would be better in almost all cases of home defense. https://t.co/f2e9QJNkjv
@WeakMighty @KamalaHarris Civilian hands	4. Rights arent unlimited, and they shouldnt be. You cant go and buy a fully automatic rifle, that most will fire in short burst to remain accurate. Your first ammendment rights arent unlimited either. Try yelling fire in a crowded building, see how that works out.
@WeakMighty @KamalaHarris 1) "well regulated" Funny how everyone seems to forget that part.	2) Some of us arent even calling for semi automatic rifles to be banned. Those who are are only talking about rifles, not handguns.	3. I dont care if the gun is painted in rainbow colors, it shouldnt be in
@WeakMighty @KamalaHarris Not one of us want to take away your rights. We want new regulation on firearms. Why cant we regulate them like cars? Of course there would have to be a few changes, but the overall idea could work. Having insurance, a license (in all states), ect would be a great first step.

@ABLAND0625 @SenatorMenendez Oh im not saying that it is perfect, however its a starting point. Determining who decides on the regulations is the most difficult part. Maybe another elected official on a state level? I dont know. But the ideas in my second tweet wouldnt take anyone's rights away.
@ABLAND0625 @SenatorMenendez Guy, but if it can save lives, im all for it.
@ABLAND0625 @SenatorMenendez I am not saying take peoples guns. Why cant we regulate them like cars? Insurance, license (in all states) to own, ect?

@jordan_serena @davidhogg111 @NRA @FBIMiamiFL @browardsheriff Dont get me wrong, they dropped the ball on this one, but the NRA is not innoncent just because @browardsheriff deserves some blame.

@RY2066 @davidhogg111 I understand what you are saying, but i just want to mention that a lot of kids play video games, and an overwhelming majority have never imitated any of the acts depicted in video games. I feel as if a parent should know if thier kid is mature enough to play them before (1/2)

@JobTrendr @davidhogg111 @FBI @NRA The issue is that our politicians dont like to act without the data, and the dickey amendment blocks just that. I want research to be done before we act. If they were allowed to do research beforehand, we would have an idea as to what to look for in these potential killers.

@MrMacslapper @galvinator93 @Bungie @DeeJ_BNG @A_dmg04 @Cozmo23 @cgbarrett You cannot say that they are communicating better now. I have an unpopular opinion about this, but i dont think the community was very good at communicating until recently either. While they have to lead the communication, we arent perfect either.
@DystopianSnowmn @Cozmo23 While we all want them asap, id rather them not have to rush for these changes.
@Bungie Thank you for discussing the sniper bug. While it sucks that its there, im happy that you guys were able to communicate it with us. I hope to see more communication like this in the future.
@DavidVonderhaar The only one you are missing is Chrome
RT @TheEllenShow: For every retweet of this tweet, Bell will donate 5 cents to mental health initiatives. Here‚Äôs my 5 cents. Where‚Äôs yours?‚Ä¶
@eperez___ @cgbarrett Did we not get a Development roadmap today? Communicating is a two way thing. We asked the question and got the anwser.
@juberto_ @Extremlzm @Bungie I never said that it was handled well. And its a shame that you cannot talk to me like a human being. Im was just giving reasons as to why it is taking a long time. I'd love to continue to discuss this with you once you learn to talk to people. Enjoy your day
@Extremlzm @Bungie After that, they need to test it. Then, in this case, they need to coordinate with Sony, Microsoft, ect. To update their product. After they are able to update the product, you Finally see it on your console.
@Extremlzm @Bungie Lets talk about how large companies work. First, someone has an idea for a product/service ect. Second, they need to flesh out the idea. Third, they need to get green lights from many higher ups before any other work is done with the idea. Next, they need to actually make it
@Armlock311 @DevastatedCloud @Bungie Did you enjoy your time with the franchise at any point? If yes, then you didnt waste your time
@xisumavoid The only guitar related items ill buy online are strings and picks. If your music store wont let you try them, its time to find a different music store.
@RoyATurnerIII @BungieHelp They dont control the people playing on crappy connections.
@FoleyMeTonight @jesusba50319595 @BungieHelp Theres a difference between giving them constructive criticism, And just giving them a hard time. Constructive criticism is what we need more than anything right now.
@WestCoastTyrant @BungieHelp My understanding of this, which i could be wrong, is that it was just displaying the wrong number. I think you were getting the correct amount of points the entire time. Again, could be wrong.
@Bloo_Ba @DjDATZ @CTD_SLIM @BungieHelp @Bungie Open your eyes. All software developers have this problem.
@JohnJohn_pat @mjmanross79 @Bungie Yes, but do you really want artists and writers coding the game? Let me explain this. You are at work, and your coworker stops working. Does that mean you should stop working? No. You continue doing your job. The artists and writers were hired to make the story, not code the game
@BeardedShaman @mjmanross79 @Bungie Its not even just studios. It is any company. It is amazing how people can talk so much about something they know nothing about. People need to learn that its obvious when you have no idea what you are talking about. And that makes you look like an idiot.
@mjmanross79 @Bungie Starting off by saying "Not trying to be a dick, ..." Automatically makes you one. Theres multiple teams at any company. Some make merchandise, some do PR, some manage, and so on.
@the_gloworm @BungieHelp Im gonna make the mistake of talking to you like a human being. While testing is done before a patch is released, they will NEVER find everything. They cannot emulate the number of people who will find bugs. Its just that simple They can change one thing, and it can break another
@ImOnlyRavenV2 @TheCryptarch @Bungie Id bet that youd not want to see threats on your personal social media accounts daily. Its not ok to do this
@ipwn_starr @TheCryptarch @Bungie So theatening people is okay because of that? Sorry but its not. Grow up.
@MrAwesome495 @Bungie They dont owe you a refund, you payed for the game, and you got the game. Go find something better to do with your free time. I hear monster hunter is great.
@FearEliteAce @Bungie That will never happen. While i agree that bungie made some questionable changes, They need to pay the bills. Unless you want everything locked by a paywall, in a free to play format. And honestly, you paid for the game, and you got the game. They owe us one more DLC, thats it.
@CL0UDS1972 @Dbuckfan @Bungie May I suggest trying to expand your vocabulary if you struggle to find a better way to say that? Maybe use the time that your using to make worthless comments on a bungie post? Come back when you have something constructive to say.
@orngoak54 @Bungie You do realise their goal, as with any other company, is to make a profit. And if they dont work to make the game better, their sales for their next game, destiny or not, will go down. This is the kind of comment that is a waste of everyones time.
@the_HogDragger @damour007 let me give you an example, saying "you f*cking stole my money" and "fix your sh*t game" dont help in any way. Saying that you need to feel more rewarded for completing the high lever activites are two different things.
@the_HogDragger @damour007 You dont seem to understand. The uproar slowed the progress down if anything. Ive seen people threatening Bungie employees. On their personal twitters. The constructive criticism that has been given from the disappointingly small part of this community has done more.
@the_HogDragger @damour007 Theres a difference between positive constructive criticism, and negativity. The negativity gets you nowhere. So yes, we would still be getting these changes.

@trhl4589 @DeeJ_BNG It was a design decision, not a limitation.
@LightUpMySenses @DeeJ_BNG Then tell me this, why do you care? If you moved on, then go. They made a mistake, and now are taking the steps to fix the mistake. Youve gotta give them credit for even acknowledging it. Most would just ignore it entirely and move on.
@sjostern10 @MyNameIsByf Yes. The features are not there, and they are putting them there. Simple as that. It is a step forward from where we are now.
@Absolu1eZero @DystopianSnowmn @MyNameIsByf They will probably stay closer to the original because they see what bungie did with d2. They arent blind, they knlw whats happening.
@sebguts10 @MyNameIsByf I feel like we all need to get into that mindset sooner rather than later. But i dont think most will be able to get into that mindset sadly. I totally agree with you

@G__Willikers @reclusivedrag0n @MyNameIsByf Its not as simple as copy pasting it.

@owzley @RelaxedVictim @Gothalion @cgbarrett They have families. You arent looking at the big picture. I was stating the fact that it isnt realistic to expect it to disappear, unless some legal regulation happens. It just wont happen, because people will spend money on microtransactions. Its proved lucrative in the past.
@RelaxedVictim @Gothalion @cgbarrett Not that im a fan of microtransactions, but removing them outright just isnt realistic for most games. These companies need to attract employees, and thats where some of the funds go. And if those employees find a better job, working for a different game, they are going to do it.
