@m21kilomike Just look at the Ocasio Cortez memes that tail just about every "Trump Train" posted.  It's fairly obvious, at least here on Twitter there's very little real political debate and a whole lot of meme slinging.
And while we're on the topic... remember @Twitter is NOT a public forum, it's a commercial entity that can establish its own rules and permit or exclude at their discretion.  A voice on #Twitter is NOT a constitutional right.
I used to always criticize the left for their slanderous tactics, but now I'm seeing the same behavior from the right.  I just want to disassociate myself from politics all together, which isn't really the American thing to do.
I'm not a fan of Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez politics, but the way the Internet has meme'd her is pure bullying.  Criticizing her politics is fair game, but the memes go way over the line and really disgust me.  #GrowUp #Bullying

I enjoy keeping up with politics and hearing all sides.. occasionally I may spew a few #maga #gop tweets, but that's not my focus or main identity.. pretty much why my profile isn't splattered with political imagery. Weird I feel the need to explain that.
Really, I'm not a snowflake.  If you don't like my tweets just unfollow me I'm a big boy.  But blocking me makes it so I can't read your tweets.. and often I still want to hear what you have to say even if you don't want to hear me.
@BiglyTrumpette @oneyebat @guyyoudontknow6 Possible I suppose but I'm going to lean towards unlikely as I'm more of a political reader and rarely post on topic..  just would seem to not follow would be more of a solution then to block.

Here's a cool idea - How about a job/employment website using the dating/matchmaking model where you enter your skills into a database and get matched up to positions matching those criteria instead of scrolling through lists of candidates and opening. #Employment
The whole #JobHunt thing for me isn't about a prestigious title or high salary.  I want to work with passionate people for a company I can truly become a fan of and feel great about what I'm doing. #JobSeekers
I really wouldn't mind taking a position outside of the IT space even for lesser pay if it were something I enjoy and have a passion for but employers just look at my past experiences and say "Why the hell would you want to work here?" and dismiss me.  #TypeCast
Can't wait till I can enjoy weekends again... as a #JobSeeker weekends are just so non-productive and you're too budget conscious to enjoy the "day off"
A repost of a job opening that posted the day before really does not justify an email titled "New Job Alerts" @indeed @ZipRecruiter
Job sites should really limit the number of positions employers can post in bulk, when I scan the sites for new opportunities and have to scroll through pages of Uber/Lift ads I just bail out and move onto the next site. @linkedin @indeed #JobSeekers
Welp, finally humbled down and officially filed for unemployment.  My goal is to secure a job before that first check arrives.  Very demoralizing but I'll get through this.
Maybe it's just a cultural thing but some off these off-shore recruiters that call give me a sketchy vibe.  Considering I don't want to discourage any job opportunities I treat them with respect but they do come across to me as very aggressive.  #JobHunt
Very proud of my wife who today became a state certified pharmacy tech and thanks to this promotion is keeping the bills paid.  But call me a chauvinist but being unemployed at the moment I feel guilty that she has to work, even if she wants to.  Make any sense?
Had another phone interview today, think it went well... have a live interview next week. Still have to apply for unemployment, I know it's insurance and not welfare but still a bit of shame in my mind I have to shake. #mentalhealth #unemployment
One phone interview today in the #ManagedPrint #OfficeAutomation sector.  Seemed to have went well, let's see if it gets legs. #JobSeekers
Anyone who looks at my resume can clearly see I'm an IT/Tech guy, so why do companies like @AIL_NILICO say they've found me and thought I'd be good for a commission based insurance sales job? #SmellsFishy
A cat I'm sitting for is snoring... never heard a cat snore before.. so cute!
@mahles Congrats on the new job!
Two days without a job related call.. bummer.. last week the calls were colliding into each other and rolling to voicemail.  Spending a solid 4 hours a day putting out resumes and filling out apps. #JobSeekers
Had such a great start on the job hunt last week but now everything seems to be fizzling.  Lots of promises but no followup.  If it's not a fit I can accept that but to just hide and not respond at all?  #Frustrated
Do you remember when you joined Twitter? I do! #MyTwitterAnniversary Hard to believe it's been 11 years and nearly 25,000 tweets!!!  I've seen a lot of #SocialMedia platforms come and go but @Twitter has always been my favorite. https://t.co/yNcIZbKfsq
Had no idea we had a DTS UV Printer manufacturer in the state, just a few towns over from me..  Just sent my resume over to them ( @DCS_US  ) - Heck I'd get a kick out of a plant tour even if the interview went nowhere. #JobSeeker #Graphics #Technician
Wow, this is even cooler... @CareerBuilder shows you how many views you're resume received AND who looked at them!  And they don't charge for it like @LinkedIn does.  Winner Winner Chicken Dinner! #JobSeekers
@FreakyFwoof I won't miss Google+ in the "now" but certainly did back when it fizzled out after it's initial popularity.  Of course I also miss Google Wave so don't know what that says about me! #SocialMedia
Wow.. Nice touch how @ZipRecruiter gives you a ping when a potential employer reviews your resume. #JobSeekers
Against my better judgment but I think I'm going to start considering contract work.  The work and pay seems good but it kinda bothers me to start a new job that comes with a pre-set termination date.
@MontrealIndian Thanks, I'll get through this.  The real hard part is just weeding through all these fake recruiters and employers that set up interviews (both in-person and phone) that either don't show or cancel at the last minute.
Wow.. stumbled on a job board that wanted a micro transaction to show me the actual listing.. uh.. don't think so.
Been in denial too long I guess... applying for unemployment in the morning (they're closed today) :(
Online "assessments" should not be part of the job application process, they should be part of the 2nd or 3rd round screening process. #StopWastingTime #jobseeker #Career
Maybe I'll feel differently in a few months but I refuse to submit any online job applications that look like they will take more then a half hour to complete unless there's a serious offer being made.  #jobseeker #Career
@IkeIsaacson2 I'd love to! Unfortunately my skills are solidly rooted in the technical side and I'm a miserable salesperson.  I'd love to dive in and hire proper staff but I simply don't have the capital.

If you had an AM radio in the 50's, you would have seen these "CD" marks on the dial... when you heard the air horns go off you'd tune in to these marks, essentially the Presidential Alert system of the day.  It came to fruition in 1951 via President Truman. https://t.co/5sjlvcJSsN
Can't believe some people complaining about the presidential alert system..  it's not a partisan issue.  This is something we've been trying to perfect since Truman gave us the Conelrad system in the 50's. https://t.co/Qprl4gd8lC #EBS #EAS #FEMA

Can't say that it's cold but there's a dampness in the air that has me intermittently turning on the furnace to get a blast of hot air in the house now and then.  Normally my general rule is to keep the furnace off till Thanksgiving but I'm making an exception! #Weather
Hmm.. so it's #InternationalPodcastDay - For a social media thing why is it I only heard about it today, the actual day of the event? - Have to admit thought for a second it did make me think about restarting a podcast.

Is it me or is it unusual for a large (500+ employee) company to offer NO holiday pay.  The excuse they use is that their healthcare so they never take holidays.
So.. how much weight do you put in @indeed and @Glassdoor employer reviews?  Have an interview in an hour with a company that over 200 (very) negative reviews. Guess I'll bring it up during the interview and gauge the response. :/ #jobseeker

@JohnHaydenNC I can't imagine a non-IT / Tech position that I could command $67k from.  For me the culture, camaraderie and ethics of a company far outweigh job title or salary.  I'd consider any position that doesn't involve sales or commissions.
@JohnHaydenNC Yea, didn't see any relevant opening.. at least not in the North East.  I've had some interest on the healthcare side of IT with some new found skills I acquired from my last position.
@MarcM3365 Yup, sucks big time.  Had a bad feeling about the place once I realized that the nigh supervisor doesn't work nights!  WTF
Pro Job Hunting Tip - When an employer blocks the ability for former employees to leave a review... well... there's your sign! #LiveAndLearn

So the week began with a mass @LinkedIn @indeed database crawl for potential employment.  #WishMeLuck
Well.. chalk this up to "The Grass Isn't Always Greener...." thought I made a break from a job I was miserable at (but stuck with cause we have to pay the bills) and recruited into something that just wasn't as it appeared.  Unfortunately at the losing end and job hunting again.

@GetPiTop @BestBuy Unfortunately most of your "distributors" only sell the Pi-Top through their web-stores so their physical location is a bit irrelevant.
As it turns out my biggest challenge of working the #NightShift and having 4-day work weeks is the boredom on my down time.  Denny's, Walmart and the 24-hour pharmacy just doesn't cut it.
If there was a place that sold @GetPiTop Pi-Tops (or any Raspberry Pi stuff) locally I'd be buying stuff up...  I know I can order it but I want immediate satisfaction (while I actually have time to mess with it) - @BestBuy is listed as a local distro but they just order it. :(

Well looks like my first night on the night shift is going to be a stormy one.  That may put a damper on my plan to take a quick walk outside during my break for fresh air and rejuvenation.  Guess I'll just pick up some 5-Hour Energy shots as a plan b! LOL #caffeine #5hourenergy
Wow! https://t.co/nRqhJKog0W
If come to the consultation that the most satisfying sleep is achieved when you do it when you really shouldn't.
My attempt at acclimating myself to the night shift not going so well, guess I'll just hop into the fire tomorrow, suck it up and let my body work it out. #nightshiftproblems
@MontrealIndian Thanks! I've done nights years ago and enjoyed it. No complaints with the 4 day work week as well!
Today should be my last day of training for the new job... this weekend will be dedicated to nudging my circadian rhythm into asymmetrical night-shift mode.
Since starting this new job, not once have I felt like I had a "bad attitude" when I wake up. #StressFree
Wow... been a long time since I've worked at a company that bought me lunch... "just because" - Still loving the new job!  Almost forgot what it's like to actually "like my job" #GoodVibes
Not a big fan of the new self-checkouts at @StopandShop - far too small to use for more then a few items.  Think you're gonna lose me with the latest round of remodeling.  Sorry. (ps - You have noticed more people are using the traditional cashier checkout now haven't you?)
Dangit.. main desktop pc has power supply issues... hmmm use it as an excuse to upgrade?
First week of the new job behind me... still feeling good vibes about this.  One more week of training then into the world of asymmetrical work schedule.  Welcome to the land of 24/7 support.  #ItsAllGood
@sikkdays Which gender do these TransRobots identify with?
New week... New Job... as Mario would say... "Here we goooooo!!!!!!!"
A reasonably uneventful last day at this job..  Boss deliberately shielded my replacement from me... guess he didn't want me to warn about him.  Actually I'm still a bit mad nobody warned me about what I was getting into...  over a year of my life totally wasted.
Out with the old, in with the new.... Last day at the "old job" today...  have to admit, awfully hard not to just blow it off and start the weekend early. LOLz
Wow... I woke up just giddy thinking about starting my new job next week!  Feels good to feel good!
Last full week complete at the soon to be former job, short week next and then begins my next chapter. #woot

@thepete Perhaps its the redundancy that bothers me, since most people already carry a smartphone at all times, what does the smartwatch give me that I don't already have or can do better?  Quick hands free message notification is all I come up with.
Just a random thought...  we can all go to any gas station to easily fuel our cars and never worry if the nozzle will fit... shouldn't there be a similar connection standard for charging an #ElectricVehicle ?
@thepete Perhaps when we fully develop a hybrid OLED / Digital Ink display that produces high resolution color when needed supplemented by always on / daylight readable more uses will become apparent.
@thepete Seems to boil down to form factor when comparing smart watches to smart phones. Other than medical applications and simple notifications I'm hard pressed to think of applications that better delegated to a watch.
Can't justify why, but I really want one of these things! https://t.co/aB397IH2Zh
@thepete Don't get me wrong, I want one myself but mostly for the cool-factor.  But I guess I'm expecting them to be more than just a wearable smartphone fitbit combo.  I'd like to see an ad-hoc network option so a family could directly intercommunicate with each other and IoT devices.

Thinking about it further, Dental X-Ray devices are often tethered via USB to a conventional laptop for image processing and storage... so I'm guessing a RasPi will do just fine.
I've repaired X-Ray machines that are essentially a glorified webcam with a PC inside as the "guts" - I don't see an issue if the RasPi is in the case with the rest of the electronics. https://t.co/FkUn9HjS1O

I would have enjoyed #InfinityWar infinitely better if our local @Cinemark upped their game on concessions.  Popcorn tastes, seemed to be very stingy with the butter and packet salt?  Really?  I don't mind paying a premium for concessions but at least give me some indulgence!
Took the wife to see #InfinityWar - All I can say is WOW and with her being the HUGE fan in the family, glad I was there for support.  As a casual fan I also thought it was awesome!

Really looking like a relocation to #Tennessee is imminent. I'm so done with #connecticut
Current debate in my head.. stick with Outlook/Exchange or back to Google Calendar? #timemanagement
I know I'm having a relaxing vacation because I have no idea what day of the week it is! #yayme
Beginning to look like a relocation from #Connecticut to #Tennessee is immanent.   It will be a slow move... have to sell the house, physically move and buy a new one.
I have access to free wifi at the moment but something comforting about being logged into my own Mobile Hotspot instead. #WiFi
Officially in vacation mode...  now tweeting from #OakRidge #Tennessee :)
Less then 8 hours till I'm officially in vacation mode! #yayme
May re-explore stepping away from MS Office as well.  I really could easily live with @libreoffice as a replacement (actually it would be an upgrade) but that Outlook substitute remains elusive.
Modern PCs makes me feel so "disconnected" from my hardware hacking roots.  When I return from vacation I'm going to attempt to live my digital life on  Pi-Top for mobile applications and a Raspberry Pi (maybe a ceed?) as a desktop.  I know it's been done but I wanna try myself.
Had a great meal at @olivegarden - But disappointed that we forgot our leftovers, was looking forward to it tomorrow for lunch.  We went back in to fetch it just minutes after we left and our table had already been bussed and our precious leftovers were trashed :( #DateNight
Looking forward to my vacation but also looking forward to getting back.. planning on rebooting myself and redirecting my life a bit.
Really?  Someone just "Liked" a random tweet of mine from 2008 - bot much?
Half my day already booked with service calls... yay me I'm not stuck at the shop!
Just a few more days till my roadtrip to #Tennessee  - Hoping my body is up to the marathon 14-hour drive.. back in my younger days it was a cake walk.. thinking not so much anymore but flying is just so unpleasant these days.  Service sucks, not worth the hassles of security.

@JamesLe39830038 @stevewoz @facebook @DiamondandSilk We don't need new apps... we need new platforms!
I really think we need to go back to the days of "Personal Homepages" and user run BBS systems.  That's when "social media" was really about freedom. We've lost something along the way.
Between the news of @SteveWoz leaving @Facebook and @DiamondandSilk deemed "Unsafe Content" - If anyone has a killer app in the works to compete with FB, now would appear to be a good time to move forward! #MakeTheInternetGreatAgain
Really?  "Unsafe Content"? - Controversial yes, but it would seem they (FB) could apply this logic to any subject matter they don't agree with.  This goes a bit beyond the typical liberal-conservative arguments, we ALL need to take heed at what's going on here. https://t.co/das2muhEJx
So by sleeping twice per day I essentially have 4-day weekends between 10-day work weeks.  Not sure if that's a good thing or not?
I'm thinking my temporal confusion is being caused by this biphasic sleep pattern I've slipped into.  Basically I've been sleeping twice per 24-hour period with extended wake-time between each cycle.  Kinda like a 2-for-1 day. #SleepDisorder

Seriously @minecraft , now that your all @microsoft corporate and not a little #indie shop - these April Fools pranks are inappropriate.

So.. with the demise of #AdobeMuse I decided to play around with #Wordpress again...  fully intending to explore using it as a CMS I got sidetracked and am intrigued with traditional blogging and content creation.. exploring this possibility now.
Very frustrated...  I left the world of #coding for the creative world of #design but as I look for alternatives to #AdobeMuse I feel that I'm being forced back into that coding world if I want to continue with #WebDesign
Icey drizzle in central Connecticut..  #ChronicPain flaring up..  Guess I'll stay up until the meds kick in and try to channel my energy into some creative dabbling.
#adobemuse and @adobe has certainly taught me a valuable lesson  about #codependency
This whole #AdobeMuse fiasco makes me wish #Microsoft would resurrect #FrontPage
Looking at #AdobeXD as a tool for web design but I don't see it as being much more than a pre-code scratch pad.  Graph paper and pencil works just as well for me. :/ #AdobeMuse
So, and update on my #AdobeMuse thoughts...  embracing code makes the most sense for future proofing but alas, now I see #Dreamweaver as just a glorified text/code editor and there are many alternatives to the other @adobe products.  So should I really stay committed to Adobe?
Perhaps @adobe was right about #AdobeMuse - Just a small blip of trending traffic over the news and it already fizzled out.  I really expected a social media explosion.
I was always a fan of @Belkin - Now with  #Foxconn at the helm I can only see the brand getting stronger.  Looking forward to watching this unfold.
@AnaisBrg @webflowapp Looks like a great app but I'd still be dependant on them to continue supporting the product into the future.  If I embrace @webflowapp and they suddenly shut down we're back to the same problem.
Random thought post #AdobeMuse meltdown...  may switch focus from graphic design and esthetics to informational content creation.  #Creativity
First call of the day is a RAM upgrade.  Not looking forward to it because the client may have unrealistic expectations about the performance increase.  They don't want to admit their hardware is simply underpowered for their particular task of manipulating high-megapixel images.
So now that it's sunk in for a bit, what's every course of action now that #AdobeMuse is dead? I'm considering going back to print design but embracing code isn't out of the question yet. #GraphicDesign
So.. Do I abandon my Adobe CC subscription now that my #1 reason for subscribing has been deprecated?  Sure I like using Photoshop and Illustrator but in my workflow those two products don't justify the cost.
With the demise of #AdobeMuse I have a lot of reassessment to do.  I'm a designer not a developer.  Do I get completely out of the web game and focus on the hardware world?  This is truly distressing to me.

I swear my body has its own second consciousness... yesterday I joke about playing hookie from work, today my back goes into crazy spasm and forces me to stay in bed. Grrrrr.  If there was such thing as an effective pain med that allowed me to be functional I'd be all set.
After losing my weekend to cold recovery.. Now that I'm feeling better I'm having a heck of a time resisting the urge to play hookie from work! #LOL
Can't get a decent shot with my phone but this locally heavy fog is creepy! #Fog #Weather #ManchesterCT
Am I the only one who feels being compartmentalized into a 24-hour daily cycle too restrictive?  #IAmWeird
Too bad I wasted the weekend battling this cold but at least I'm off to a good start to the week now.  Good night everyone!
My #ObamaCare package is really only good to cover a one-shot catastrophic incident.. not long term care or preventative maintenance.
So yea, I have a reasonably price health insurance package.  But for each of my issues I'd like to address throw in a $100 with of doctor co-pays and eventually a $50/mo prescription of some sort and my budget is broke.
You know, just because one has health insurance doesn't mean one can actually afford treatment. #AffordableHealthcare #ChronicPain #Healthcare
You know you've slept good when you wake up confused about what day it is! #Rested #Sleep
Loading up on Vitamin-C via Orange Juice...  Hope to shake this cold by Monday.  At least this is a "normal" illness and my chronic pain seems to have calmed down. :)
Managed to fall asleep super early... of course that also means I'm awake super early as well!  LOL.. It's all good!
Can't make this stuff up... just getting some relief from a #ChronicPain flair up and on come the #Flu symptoms.  At least there's plenty of OTC remedies to knock em out and it's the weekend so I can just sleep it off.
I think all those good vibes really helped!  The worst is over now, Thank You! @spiffy @SonyaJMills @SusanSteele8385 @KrolGary #GoodPeople
My health wasn't cooperating last year, but I think I have a shot at it this time around... Can't wait!!!! #PodCamp https://t.co/CbNnAoArc6
Serious question... Is homemade Banana Bread a viable source of potassium? #Nutrition
Trying really hard to not be a whiny little bitch but this is day two of a serious chronic pain flare-up and it's getting harder and harder to hold it together. #SendMeGoodVibes
Gonna try this sleep thing again...  Foot pain from #neuropathy kept me awake, seems to be most painful when I'm horizontal but I can't sleep sitting up.  #IveGotThisRound
I actually miss the days when creators couldn't make money from their #YouTube videos.  I thought the content was much for fun and genuine back then.  Now it's quickly resembling broadcast television.  The very medium I try to avoid!
LOL - So #YouTube is demonetizing me due to their new subscriber-count and watch hour thresholds..  Heck.. since I just do videos now and then for fun I'm grateful you provide the space and bandwidth to host it!  It's not like I can quit my day-job anytime soon to be a youtuber.
Pain level finally dropped from an 8.5 to a 7, I'm sucking it up like the princess that I am :) #ChronicPain - Pretty sure this is weather related.. clearing snow tomorrow will probably do me in for the remainder of the week.
Curious.. Why are WiFi and Cellular jamming devices illegal but not RF-proofing a structure with a Faraday cage? #FCC #RF #WiFi #LTE #4G
Here we go again... I'll probably lose a day's pay since my boss will stay closed and possible lose another day when I'm out with a bad back after the clean up. #HateWinter https://t.co/8ar9YUxDr2

Soo.. up to 8" is the latest forecast I hear for central Connecticut.  At least the recent few days of mild temps cleared the ground of snow so we'll have plenty of room to plow. #CTWX #Snow #Winter #NewEngland
@thejanbeta I have a similar cheap lighting rig.. the weakness is in the screw collars.  My tightening mechanism quickly became stripped.  Since I had a semi-permanent installation I resorted to duct tape to maintain height adjustments.
Yikes! Can't believe how much keeping the house warm during this recent cold snap cost me!  Over double what I payed this time last year!  #HVAC #NaturalGas #Winter #Cold #NewEngland
@SonyaJMills Believe me would much rather have a genuine "fix" - drugs are just a band-aid.  I just get frustrated at the stigmatism associated with it.  If I became addicted, I'd like to think I would have case for a lawsuit against my physician thus treatment.
The topic of #Relocation just popped up again at home.  We really need to move out of #Connecticut - #TennesseeThePlaceToBe is on the radar. #OakRidge area. - Of course that means I'd need to find a job there!
So what's going on with #SnapChat ? I'm only hearing the "kids" talk about it lately.  I tried it out for a while but seemed to time consuming to follow people of interest.  Video just takes too long to consume and being short-form doesn't lend itself to casual viewing.
With the variety of topics I cover in my tweets I find it puzzling that a picture of my meal at a local chain restaurant without any hashtags is one of my most popular and engaging tweets I ever published.  What does that say about Twitter users? #TwitterAnalytics #SocialMedia
Interesting observation about #TwitterAnalytics - Just had a bot retweet me and I noticed it didn't register as an engagement.  I never liked (nor follow back) #TweetBots
Just got a new follower on #GooglePlus - I totally forgot about that platform!  Is anyone still actively using it? #SocialMedia
Of course I'd rather have a true "cure" to my condition and not just mask the symptoms but until that time comes this course of action is a Godsend.
If it weren't for my (legal) access to opioids, I'd be laying in bed right now raging pain and now awake and productive.  When you have a responsible doctor and take medications as prescribed there's little danger of complications.
12° F in Manchester, CT - Guess that cold front is here.  Brrrr #CTwx #Winter #Weather

@RogerBezanis I agree with you, but it's not a "fake disease" any more than lung cancer isn't real because not smoking could prevent it.  My big issue with "Big Diabetes" is how they keep lowering the threshold for what's considered diabetic, much like when high blood pressure was the rage.
@RogerBezanis The cause and treatments may be in question but it certainly is real.  After losing my insurance and going a year without insulin to regulate my glucose, peripheral neuropathy kicked in full swing.  I am happy to say that with diet alone I'm now in control but the damage is done.
I know I could connect LTE/3G to a conventional router, but want 100% untethered battery operation.  So basically I want a MiFi with real network configurability.  (DMZ/Port Forwarding/Manual Routing, etc.)
Calling the Geek #BrainTrust - Is there such a thing as a #MobileBroadband #Router with robust router settings?  Need a portable/battery solution for setting up laptop based client/server app. #Networking

Somewhere along the line I stole a #BIC Crystal 1.6mm pen.. you know what.. I really like it!  Has a nice fat bold line and smooth roll. @BICGroup you done good! #pens #ballpointpen
Paid off my past-due medical bills over the weekend.  Lesson learned..  Just because you have insurance doesn't mean you can afford any form of treatments. Keeping my mouth shut during my next physical. #HealthCare
So much #stress and discontent about my job that I never can get to sleep on a Sunday night before work.  I really need to find a better job!
Trying hard to take action rather than complain and if there's no logical course of action suck it up until I find a solution. Problem is when I hear others complain it's difficult to not get sucked into the bitch fest.
So happy to see temps going above freezing for next week! #NEWeather #HappyDance
I find it bizarre and mildly amusing that when I use the word #coffee in my tweet the analytics go nuts. #LOL - BTW, I'm getting a cup of coffee to warm up from this dang arctic freeze we're dealing with! #CTWeather

Mission Accomplished.  Now that I have a working snow blower I was able to clear the sidewalks so the kids can safely get to school come Monday morning. #WinterStorm #safety #snow
Hmm.. No holiday pay expected for New Year and lost 8-hours because the shop didn't open during the storm.  Gonna be a crap paycheck.  IT Manager + Field Tech, over 25 year experience... Very available &amp; looking for decent job. #agedescrimination #jobseeker #humble
Posted about my snowblower breaking down during the storm on our local community Facebook page and a good neighbor came by and plowed me out unprovoked.  Heartwarming seeing this kind of community spirit! #ManchesterCT #SnowStorm #CTWeather
Light snow in Manchester, CT but it's deceivingly slippery on the local roads.  #WinterStormBrody #CTWeather
I'm sure it's coming but this morning in Manchester, CT I'm just seeing a dusting on the windshield.  #WinterStorm
Really hate losing a days pay but kinda hoping the boss calls a #snowday tomorrow. #CTWeather
Oh Joy - 4-18 inches and 50 mph winds forecast for tomorrow and more arctic cold predicted for the weekend.  Fueling up the snow blower, not looking forward to this. #CTWeather
Think the shop that services my car waters down their wash fluid. This stuff shouldn't freeze! #coldweather #Automotive
@lscottharrell Don't know who came up with the follow-followback idea but it was someone who puts too much weight on the numbers rather than true organic growth by genuine dialog.  Somewhere along the way we lost much of the "social" that social media is all about!

@sikkdays Pretty much the same.  Honestly since 9/11 I've always feared if there were another attack, a day like today would be likely.  Planning on finding a Time Square live stream on YouTube.  Hasn't been the same without Dick Clark hosting the show.
Nope.. no desire to see this live.. at least not in this climate!!!  But boy do I certainly miss watching Dick Clark host the show on TV! #NewYears https://t.co/SOwoMxsoIZ

Winding down from the holiday weekend.. back to work and continuing my HP Printer battle.. this time with a replacement machine.  Couldn't convince the client to jump over to the @EpsonAmerica side, perhaps this time they will! Hope you all had an awesome Christmas!
@8bitadc At some of these no-name gas stations I even question the ethics of the owners themselves.  One time I received an AMEX Fraud alert message from a pump I was legitimately getting gas from!

Seems to be too many websites built on CMS, presumably to make the obsession with responsive design a bit simpler.  It makes sense for some content, but if your site simply isn't useful on the small screen why bother.. well other then for Google mojo.  Really miss HTML 1.0 days.
Wow, fired up Adobe Muse again and logged into my website control panel.  Maybe I'm getting my groove back!  Thanks to being insured again and having a reasonably secure supply of opioids along with TENS and moist heat therapy, I'm actually feeling better lately. #ChronicPain
Got my tickets to see #StarWarsTheLastJedi tomorrow night.  Starting off with dinner at @texasroadhouse before the show, gotta have me a rack of ribs!  Really looking forward to this #datenight
Feels like we've crossed that magical combination of atmospheric measures that cripples me.  At least warmer temps are in the immediate forecast.  Thank goodness my doctor still prescribes #opioids - That with some moist heat will get me through the night and at work tomorrow.

More HP printer issues today.  This time a model that doesn't seem to play nicely with Terminal Services Easy Printer Driver.  At least not with Furniture Wizard software.
Ideally, I'd love to see hobbyists take over the internet in a similar fashion to amature radio.  If I had the resources I'd love to create a new non-commercial, academic oriented internet managed and distributed by volunteers.  Remember the old days of FIDOnet?
I notice that nobody seems to be complaining that only a very small number of providers give you access to raw Usenet feeds.  Would net neutrality bring that genre back?
And lets say as a consumer I'm only interested in YouTube and Facebook and prefer not to pay the overhead of my provider carrying other content, why should I be denied a discount?
If via net neutrality all carriers were to equally deliver all content providers, what would differentiate carrier A from B and what incentive would there be for someone to come in at a lower cost?  I fear an upward spiral of equal but ever increasing prices.
Don't just jump on the net neutrality bandwagon because it sounds good. Examine both sides and educate yourself on the topic. It's not as cut and dry as it first appears.

Not waiting for my back to flair up, applying moist heat as a pre-emptive strike.  Forecast is calling for some miserable cold, wet weather in CT today. #CTWeather #ChronicPain
Another day, another defective HP printer new out of the box.  Log each issue with HP and respond to surveys accordingly but no concern shown from HP. https://t.co/dgf2iSh2pS
@CarolHTucker I'm still on the fence with net neutrality.  Seems to me of some providers block or charge premiums for certain services/access that competitors would counter offer seeking to win over disgruntled subscribers with discount rates. But I do see both sides of the argument.

@JohnHaydenNC No cartridges on this new generation of "SuperTank" printers.  Bulk ink by the bottle.  Direct from Epson it's $12 a bottle, hard to beat and out of the box they supply a starter supply of ink said to last 8,000 prints. Canon and Brother seem to be following suit.
Just finished clearing the snow, deceivingly it was much colder than I thought it would be.  Major neuropathy flair up in my hands.. never felt such pain. #tramadol #opiods
Debating if I should clear the snow before temps drop or just wait it out and suffer in the morning.  I'm really shouldn't be out there at all but it has to get done.
Decided if I go ink jet, it will be one of the supertank printers.  But now I'm looking at lasers as well.  Thoughts? Print costs are my main focus. #laserprinters #inkjet #OfficeProducts
Well, looks like its going to be a little bit more snow than expected.  I'm really not ready for this :( https://t.co/G3gUOSsyFw

Let's focus on solving the cause of the pain, then we won't have to worry about this leg of the opioid crisis! #ChronicPain https://t.co/grUGwXYwaT
Probably just me but lately I've been enjoying #twitter far more than #Facebook - Once you forget about crazy analytics and just start using social media to be social, your perspective changes quite a bit.
Then HP is trying to blame the digital phone line for the failure.  Um.. it's a new line drop from the road by COX BUSINESS.  I'm gonna go out on a limb that many COX BUSINESS customers receive faxes just find and they probably know what they're doing.
Why in the world would HP REMOVE the ability to disable auto-shutoff?  A FAX that totally powers off is like an alarm clock that shuts down after an hour.. totally defeats the functionality.  I certainly can't be the only one who gets this. #FAIL
So.,..  HP still wants to prove via remote diagnostics that their printer won't receive a fax after it auto power-offs.  Uh.. so you just want to make sure it doesn't answer?  Keep in mind when it auto-sleeps it does "wake up" but power-off is a whole other animal! #Fail
Forcasting rain but sure lools like snow. #ctweather https://t.co/aG5SztbozL
Still researching a replacement home color printer.. haven't settled on a brand yet but the latest "Ink Tank" technology seems to be the way to go!  Finally unshackled from the costs of expensive proprietary ink cartridges.  It will be nice to print without regard to cost.
Ahh, had a good night sleep.  Kinda like a Monday do-over.  Of to tackle the world's IT problems now.
Another day, another service call an on HP printer... what's going on?  Used to be a rock-solid favorite of mine.  Also their Tech Support was supposed to call me back today, but didn't.  Highly out of character! #Technology #Graphics
Looks like we're definitely experiencing some plunging temperatures here in CT.  Furnace is starting to work overtime.  #Flannel
Midway through my 7pm TENS Machine session.  Consistency in sessions certainly makes a difference in pain control I'm finding. #ChronicPain
So based mostly on the abundance of issues I've been seeing in the field with Hewlett-Packard printers (all models and price points) I think it's time for me to change my allegiances.  What's YOUR favorite all around printer manufacturer?  I'm looking into Epson again. #Printers

So...  @HPSupport @HP apparently disabled the ability to disable auto power off.  That doesn't work so well when you need to receive FAXes. Will be getting on the phone with support this afternoon at a client location to see if there's a solution.
Actually looking forward to this weekend..  threw my Hail Mary pass and working on a new master life plan.  This one has to work, my last chance.  Hoping the high steaks will be the motivator. #planning #life #motivation

It's not the end of the world when you track a package shipped via @UPSHelp and it's marked as delayed, but when it's labeled as "In Transit On Time" and obviously isn't it's most aggravating.  Fortunately a voice call confirmed it was in fact delayed and arriving tomorrow.

Oh I'm just full of snark today...  have I mentioned I really hate auto replies, especially in public feeds?
@vdignan Yes, I'm testing software that detects automated replies and blocks based on lack of conversation in a feed and overuse of emoji's
@tec_teach your feed doesn't give me a compelling reason to do so.  Now what have I said that makes you think I'm remotely interested?
@JackBaldwin16 Yes, you follow back allright but doesn't appear you converse very munch based on a quick peek at your feed. :/

@VapeMyVape @DeafManVapes Word on the street is Toshiba is one to watch in near future.
@VapeMyVape @DeafManVapes @lenovo Quality overall has been degraded since IBM days, but still better than others I dealt with (HP/Dell)
@VapeMyVape @DeafManVapes ThinkPad branded are built for business, plain Lenovo are consumer.  Superior customer service from ThinkPad side.
Really? Wallingford, CT @stopandshop How can you be out of @Fritolay Original Fritos Corn Chips? My cravings!!!! http://t.co/alGeDJZla3
@DeafManVapes If you're using @swiftweather I found it to quickly need lots of resources all around as you add tracking and map details.
@DeafManVapes assuming the network isn't slowing that down, look for Nvidia GPU graphics.  Essentially more of a gaming machine.
@DeafManVapes essentially @Lenovo is two different companies depending on product line, one good one not so much.
@DeafManVapes a tip on @Lenovo - If it says ThinkPad you're getting US support and ex-IBM employees, anything else is all off-shore cheap.
@VapingWayne the problem is I happen to be good at hardware/software repairs so I'm stuck doing it.
@VapingWayne It's a necessary evil in my shop, find it boring. I much prefer and excel at the creative/marketing end of things.
@VapeMyVape as a former Apple Field Engineer I wouldn't recommend anyone exclusively CC to go to the PC side unless needed for other apps.

@Akruto So basically it's a 1-user exchange server? Will it work with 2-PCs on the same network?
@Akruto not exactly what I was looking for but VERY interesting and may be a solution for some of my clients, keeping your link handy. Thnx
@Akruto and looking at your website now.
@Akruto 3-Windows Office365 installs and 2-Android devices.  Random calendar items don't propagate. Forums full of complaints no solutions.
