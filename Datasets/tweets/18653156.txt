@AutumnNAlston Or else we’re going to have a lot of those Pre-K kids we both care about with hundreds of thousands of dollars (or even a million) in debt leaving school in 15-20 years.
@AutumnNAlston I’m all about early childhood ed too, but a big reason why college is so expensive is bc the market incentivizes raising tuition. I firmly believe we can do both without breaking the bank - but we’ve got to do it in a way that discourages unchecked tuition hikes.
@AutumnNAlston Also, we’re talking *public* 4yr college. Right now, what we see is public colleges participating in the huge tuition increases that private colleges do. If you can get a comparable college education at a nearly-free public school, private ones will have to pull back on increases
@AutumnNAlston The vast majority of outstanding student loan debt’s financed by the student only. So, even students with rich parents are often personally liable for all their debt.		Like Billie Holliday said, “Mama may have, Papa may have, but God bless the child that’s got its own.”

Under Art I, Sec 5 of the Constitution, the House is the “judge of the elections... of its own members.” Courts have viewed this provision pretty deferentially. 		Congress’ power to vacate a seat if someone isn’t “duly elected” is settled law.

On these sticky #ncga legal questions, the mental exercise I use on whether I’m being biased is the “law exam” test: if I wrote this answer on an exam in law school, would I be concerned about a bad grade? 		The @NC_Governor’s answer passes that test. #ncpol
Had the law passed yesterday (via veto override) been effective upon the expiration of the stay, different (but still complicated) story. It’s effective 1/31, though. The 2015 law fills that void. 		The #ncga isn’t empowered to extend a board the court has ruled unconstitutional.
Partisans are going to accuse me of being... partisan, but as a lawyer I think @NC_Governor’s reasoning is sound. 		If a law’s in place, a new law changing it is passed, and that new law is ruled unconstitutional, you revert back to the original law. #ncpol #ncga #nc09 #cd9 https://t.co/6WOCtfDM9S

There are serious allegations that voters were taken advantage of. Their ballots, stolen. Their rights, violated. 		Let this @NCSBE investigation run its course. 		If people broke the law - R or D - they should be punished. We have to root out wrongdoing here and stop it.
Elections are *the* most fundamental aspect of a republic. If people don’t trust elections, they view everything that flows from them as illegitimate. 		We can’t let a crack form in the foundation of our democratic system - especially because of party.
It has bothered me to no end that, over the past couple years, people have treated election fraud, suppression, and interference as though it’s just another political issue. 		No. It’s not. 		It’s really not.
To paraphrase Jay-Z, “people lie - numbers don’t.” The numbers show that something very fishy happened this election in Bladen County. 		This is *way* bigger than Harris or McCready. We have to get to the bottom of this. We have to get this right. #ncpol https://t.co/lsrpx7rK5z

@DavidTa84534406 Nah - our state constitution had a rule that said counties can’t be divided when drawing districts. The federal “One person, one vote” cases made that impossible. Grouping counties was the remedy state courts came up with to reconcile the two.
Today, let’s celebrate our Veterans by remembering why they served: to create a freer nation. #VeteransDay
No, actually the opposite. 		In Shelby County v. Holder, SCOTUS gutted the preclearance provision in 2013. This means the #NCGA no longer has to get the Justice Dept. to sign off first, so it’s possible to dilute minority strength through “cracking” (the opposite of packing). https://t.co/V6oCVBLhQJ
@EricWRowell @longleafpol Usually redistricting involves federal and state constitutional claims. There’s a case in Wake County decided a few weeks back that involved state claims.
“The Mecklenburg commissioners map was actually drawn by the Republican-controlled General Assembly in 2011, over Mecklenburg’s objections.” https://t.co/KixB9Ojh3Q		As I mentioned before, I support independent redistricting. At all levels. https://t.co/QI02PryxjM
@longleafpol That’s incorrect. That’s what I’m saying in my thread. Current constitutional law guards against that possibility.
So, I couldn’t disagree more with the article’s conclusion that “As long as Democrats own urban areas and Republicans own rural ones, the GOP will be at an advantage in districts.” It’s not consistent with the law, history, or with a myriad of statistical studies.
This article argues that Republicans, disproportionately in the rural areas, benefit from proportional, district-based representation. The framers constructed the legislative branch in the US Constitution with the opposite argument as its premise.
One of the primary arguments for having a US Senate with equal representation by state? The more rural states feared that a proportional body would become dominated by the cities. 		Dems are now disproportionately in the cities.
Finally, the article’s premise flies in the face of why we have a proportional US House to begin with. 		During the Constitutional Convention, there was much debate about whether to have a legislature where states had equal votes or votes based on population.
(Before anyone asks, I’ve said many, many times that I support independent redistricting and have voted consistent with that view in the #ncga. This is not making excuses for Dems, because gerrymandering is wrong, regardless of what party does it. I’m just reciting history.)
It’s counterintuitive, but creating a 2nd predominately-black seat actually makes partisan gerrymandering harder for Dems. 		Why?		Because districts bordering a racially-gerrymandered one actually become more Republican, not less. There are several studies demonstrating this.
Originally, Dems drew 1 predominately-black seat. At the time, plans required the Justice Dept to sign off (called “preclearance”). 		DOJ refused to preclear the plan, saying the #ncga needed to add another black district. That was why the 12th was added. See Shaw v. Reno.
That brings me to the next point. The article uses the old 12th Congressional as an example of why Dems have to gerrymander the state to make districts equal.		The article says “Democrats originally drew that district to carve themselves out another seat.” That’s factually wrong.
While gerrymandering law can be complex, what gerrymandering means is actually pretty clear. The key aspect involves drawing lines for “political advantage.” Redistricting and gerrymandering are not synonymous. 		Also, there are various types of gerrymandering.
The article says “Is this gerrymandering? Not really.” The courts - both federal and state - disagree. 		Multiple courts and multiple judges - including appointees from Republican and Democratic presidents - have determined that these maps are gerrymandered, in whole or part.
Also, because our state has a “whole county rule” in its constitution, counties must be grouped together (also based on population) before districts are even drawn. Groupings (or “clusters”) are based on a mathematical formula that neither party can avoid using.
Is geography a factor? Yes (for example, districts must be contiguous). However, geography (and, importantly, density and distributive demographics) does not override population reqs.
Controlling factors for districts are population and proportionality. These are rigid rules under case law. 		Urban districts have to have the same number of people in them as rural ones and vice versa.
Under federal case law, legislative maps have to be as close to equal in population as possible. For Congressional districts, the population must be as identical as possible among districts. State leg districts can have a 5% difference from the average, plus or minus.
In other words, this article would be just as flawed if it had argued that geography inevitably leads to Dems winning more seats than Republicans in NC. 		One constitutional requirement undercuts this argument entirely - “one person, one vote.”
First, let me preface this by saying neither geography nor case law makes it inevitable that *either* party will have an advantage over the other without gerrymandering - particularly in the current environment, where our state is pretty evenly split politically.
This article claims that “geography” inevitably leads to Republicans winning more seats than Dems in NC. 		This is fundamentally false. 		Why? Because federal and state constitutional law says so. 		Here’s a thread explaining why. #ncpol #ncga https://t.co/kus09hIg0h

@OlenIII @westripp3 No disrespect @OlenIII, but I don’t understand why you would raise this argument here. Mary Belk, Joe John, Cynthia Ball, and me all won in GOP seats that were gerrymandered *against* us in 2016. The fact we all won reelection handily is a triumph over gerrymandering, not for it.
I flipped a GOP-held seat from red to blue in 2016 to win my 1st race - gerrymandering didn’t give me anything. If anything, gerrymandering tries to keep ppl like me out of the #ncga.

I’ll get back to reading this budget now. 		A few billion dollars in spending down, a few billion more to go. 		#ncpol #ncga /end
Regardless of who ran the #NCGA, every past budget has given both parties a chance to propose changes. 		Preventing input from the body is no way to run a state - precisely why this has never been done. 		Silencing the membership is wrong, regardless of who’s in charge. #ncpol
Find a typo? You can’t correct it. 		Want a change that every single member of the #NCGA supports? You can’t add it. 		You can’t change it. I can’t change it. 		It’s quite literally take it or leave it. #ncpol
SB99 spends $23.9 billion of your hard earned money. It came out late last night, on a holiday. The 1st committee meeting was at 10am. 		You would’ve had to read about $2 billion per hour to get through the whole thing in time. #ncga #ncpol
This time, SB99 (the budget bill) started out as a car insurance bill. The House passed one version of the car insurance bill, the Senate passed another. It was sent to conference to work out the differences. 		What emerged deals with a lot more than car insurance. #ncpol #ncga
So, when a budget goes to that conference committee we talked about, it has always been after at least 3 days of deliberation, discussion, and amendment. Everyone’s had a chance to participate. 		But not this time. #ncga #ncpol
In short, our constitution makes budgets unique. It subjects them to transparency that other bills don’t necessarily have. It keeps these bills from being passed too quickly. 		In short, budgets are important - so important that they’re set apart. #ncpol #ncga
While that’s the process for the typical bill, some bills are extra special under law. 		That brings us back to the NC Constitution. It treats bills dealing with raising money, like the budget, very differently. It spreads the process over 3 days at minimum. #ncpol #ncga https://t.co/aCw22GI3A5
Bills that come out of conference committees can’t be amended - because both Houses would’ve theoretically already had a chance to amend them. The goal of the committee is to create a bill that both Houses can pass identically. #ncpol #ncga
Schoolhouse Rock talks about what happens if one House passes a bill and the other House changes it in a way the first House doesn’t like. 		They create a conference committee that works out differences and comes up with a final bill that both Houses can agree on. #ncga #ncpol 5/
Our NC constitution gives the process by which bills are passed in the #NCGA. Although Schoolhouse Rock deals with federal bills, it gives a good overview of how most bills move at the state level, too: 		1) Bill passes one house 	2) Bill passes the other	3) Bill goes to Governor
So what is this process people keep talking about that boxes out tons of #ncga members? Glad you asked. 		Let’s consult the highest authority on legislative process (the Constitution) and the second highest (Schoolhouse Rock). #jk #ncpol #ncga 3/ https://t.co/YU73mNVuqg
For the 1st time in memory, the #NCGA is moving a budget that blocks amendments, through a committee that includes zero Democrats. 		This silences the voice of duly-elected members like me. I wasn’t on the committee. I don’t get a chance to even suggest changes. #ncpol 2/
Last year, I read the entire budget - doing the same this year. You deserve a Rep who’ll pay close attention to how your money’s spent and propose necessary changes. 		There’s one huge difference this time - my input isn’t allowed. 		That’s a problem. Here’s why. #ncga #ncpol 1/ https://t.co/hu1zapXsuU

After a few minutes, he checks my license and registration, then, motioning with his flashlight, he says “go on.”		I drive off. 		I still have no idea what he was looking for. 		That happened on the same street.
Of course, my heart is racing. I say “How are you, officer?” 		He says, “where you going?”		I say, “to my grandma’s.” 		Without another word, he proceeds to search my front and backseat with his flashlight. I still remember him shining it directly in my eyes.
I do what I had been taught to do in “the conversation” I’d had many times before with my family. 		I turned on every light inside the car and put my hands on the wheel, at 10 and 2.
My family lives in Asheville - I spent a lot of my childhood there. 		One night, I was picking up my cousin to head back to my grandmother’s. 		Suddenly, I see blue lights. An Asheville PD officer walks toward my vehicle, one hand up, a flashlight in the other.

@HarryJohnsonNC Might be having people over for the game on the 3rd - stay tuned. It’s hard to have Economic conversations in 280 characters lol
@HarryJohnsonNC 1) Privatized, monopolistic tolling is an imprecise way to internalize these externalities	2) I’ll never forget my Econ professor saying that “an externality argument is the net that catches all fish” 	3) we clearly need to discuss this at halftime of another UNC game lol
@drawlinglawyer This plan isn’t being paired with large-scale investment in mass transit options (which I support). 90% of the federal funding goes elsewhere. 		Plus, these toll proceeds aren’t going into fixing transportation problems. The plan is that they’ll go to private companies.
@jaydhart No, we’re not
@HarryJohnsonNC Economically, the central problem with I-77 style toll projects is that they layer monopolistic pricing (one way around traffic) onto a public good (the free flow of interstate commerce).

@DemianCo Well Manley and Brooks got a ton of burn before exam period. Then Cam got healthy. The minutes of all the freshmen plummeted - and it showed. 		This team was totally different before and after exams, when Cam got healthy. You can tell the freshmen plateaued.
@DemianCo Exactly. The bigs are getting a lot more burn this game and it shows. Also 18 FGs on 16 assists so far this game.
RT @nytimes: Kevin Spacey is out. Diane Lane and Greg Kinnear are in. https://t.co/hCn0F1sS4B
If Carolina’s gonna get back in rhythm, they’ve gotta tighten up on defense, avoid small lineups, and work in the extra pass on offense.
3) Berry’s low assist numbers. 		Carolina is a PG-centered offense - those PGs are usually pass-first guards. Even Marcus Paige, an awesome scorer, was a reluctant scorer. 		Berry is phenomenal, but his assist numbers are way down this season. That’s rippled through the offense.
2) Rebounding. 		Rebounding is the cornerstone of UNC’s run and gun offense. 		When Cam was hurt, Manley and Brooks got a lot more minutes. They provided size. 		When Cam started getting minutes, their minutes dropped. And so did team rebounding. And so did fast break points.
1) Our 3-Point defense. 		I’ve been a Carolina fan forever, and I’ve never know us to be that good at defending the 3. This team has been particularly struggling. 		They’re next to last in the league at opponent’s 3 point shooting percentage. In the entire NCAA.
What’s going on with Carolina? This Tar Heel basketball fan has some ideas. 		Here’s a thread on the 3 reasons I think #UNC is struggling lately.
Hardworking Americans deserve more than crumbs. They deserve better than $1.50 more per week. 		“Crumbs” are being used as a selling point for tax changes that barely impact everyday people. 		Smh. https://t.co/MyWXyN7h4O

After leaving NC, she became a mentor to some of the most famous faces of the Movement, including @repjohnlewis. 		One of her goals was to keep young Movement leaders independent and empowered.
Ella Baker got started with being the truth early. She was valedictorian at Raleigh’s Shaw University. 		While she was there, she didn’t just study - she shook things up, challenging a restrictive student conduct code. 		She was destined to be one of America’s best organizers.
For #BlackHistoryMonth Day 3, let’s talk about Ella Baker, mother of the Civil Rights Movement. 		When naming leaders of the Civil Rights era, black women don’t get enough shine.

Not only did Shepard start an HBCU, he turned Durham’s Hayti neighborhood into a center of black commerce. It became nationally known as the Black Wall Street. 		He helped found a black-owned bank that still exists. 		He was also the community pharmacist. 		He did it all. https://t.co/One8EeX6HO
Shepard is known most for starting NC Central University, transforming it from a small religious school into the nation’s first state-supported black liberal arts college. 		That would be an amazing accomplishment - and enough to warrant this statue.		But wait, there’s more. https://t.co/EOVxukKXdW

During George White’s 4 years in Congress, Jim Crow laws swept across the South. Fewer blacks were allowed to vote, let alone serve in office. 		As a result, he pushed for legislation penalizing states that restricted black voting rights. 		#ncpol #BlackHistoryMonth
Congressman George White’s mom was probably a slave, but his father was a free black man. 		In his younger years, he studied Latin, graduated from Howard, and became a lawyer. 		He served in the #NCGA before heading to Congress. 		#ncpol #BlackHistoryMonth
Ever heard of George White? Well, this guy was pretty much amazing. He started his political career in the 1880s, was elected to Congress in 1898, and was the last black member of Congress from the south for 70 years. 		Yes. Seventy. 		https://t.co/pL6l8GJWvl

I’m hopeful that the Panthers will remain here. We offer an amazing fan base in a great community, and that makes our team one of the most successful in the NFL. Any deal should be the result of negotiation that yields a mutually beneficial result for the team and our community.
It is important to remember that the process is just beginning - any developments could change. This group may not be the one that successfully buys the Panthers, and any new owner could decide to keep the current stadium in Uptown or build a new one at a different location.

@GraigMeyer @alexkotch @NCDemParty Right - I was just thinking of the House my bad
Most up-to-date maps are available on the #ncga website (https://t.co/qZ1G27dHQr) - will likely change once special master's work is done. https://t.co/1kuFxq4Vkc
@Robyn780 Thanks! Just trying to demystify a lot of this stuff so we all know what's up
What the special master concludes could set off a chain reaction w/ major implications for 2018 #ncga elections. Stay tuned. 15/15 #ncpol
Impact of a special master depends on 1) how many districts must change &amp; 2) how districts around those districts will change too. 14/#ncpol
To summarize, fixing one illegal district can mean a bunch of districts change. Changing 7 House districts could affect many more. 13/#ncpol
Remember criteria about how population size can only be off by 5%? House 105 is off by 4.4%. Mine's off by 4.3%. Not much wiggle room. 12/
Redrawing 105 will require either adding or subtracting people. Those people come from neighboring districts, changing their size. 11/#ncpol
For example, House 105 (in light blue) may be redrawn. It touches 3 districts, including mine. 10/#ncpol https://t.co/0c1EJLD8gZ
Remember threads I did about all the criteria &amp; how they're pulling in diff directions? That makes a domino effect more likely. 9/#ncpol
Redrawing districts is squeezing a balloon - the air has to go somewhere. Can lead to domino effect of multiple districts changing. 8/#ncpol
Another impt point: you can't redraw just one district. To redraw one is to basically redraw the districts touching it. 7/#ncpol
One important point: appointing a special master does not mean any districts will be redrawn, but it does make it more likely. 6/#ncpol
Special master's job is to 1) tell the Court if it thinks the specific districts mentioned are illegal and 2) redraw them if so. 5/#ncpol
What the court decided to do was appoint a "special master" - basically an expert that helps the Court make an informed decision. 4/#ncpol
@alexkotch @NCDemParty Correct - all non-Hispanic white to my knowledge
@alexkotch @NCDemParty Nope
Court has a few options. It could say the districts the #NCGA drew are cool. It could also say some/all districts aren't. 3/#ncpol
To recap: 	1) Court rules old #ncga maps illegal	2) NCGA redraws maps	3) Some of new districts also challenged in court. 2/#ncpol
Another court ruling on #ncga redistricting just came out - this time appointing a "special master." Here's what it all means. 1/#ncpol https://t.co/c7uxWEae57
RT @TerryVanDuynNC: Local elections matter and so does your vote! #ncpol 	https://t.co/Fvg1nNGH5Y
Another court order that will provide more specifics and deadlines is forthcoming. No ETA included on when that'll come. #ncga #ncpol
Key takeaway: Special Master will evaluate and, if necessary, redraw districts. Redraw would at least affect any districts touching. #ncpol
Affected #ncga Senate districts: 21 (Hoke &amp; Cumberland); 28 (Guilford). Mecklenburg Senate districts not subject to special master. #ncpol
@notthatalexjone Senate 21 and 28
Affected #ncga House districts: 21 (Sampson &amp; Wayne); 36, 37, 40 and 41 (Wake); 57 (Guilford); 105 (Mecklenburg, which borders mine). #ncpol

@holdenbeachgirl That's unacceptable.
This Presidency, for better or worse, is separating the patriotic wheat from the partisan chaff. Wrong is wrong. Call it out.
Don't @ me with "But Obama" either - my Twitter criticizes Dem and GOP politicians alike. You owe it to your country to call this stuff out.
I don't care what party you are in - this is not how Presidents act. This is not how Dem Presidents act. This is not how GOP Presidents act.
The love of her life is dead. Her children are fatherless. Do you think she wants all this attention? If you lost a loved one, would you?
Instead, this President would rather use the bully pulpit to accuse a grieving widow of lying because he just can't say "I was wrong."
Any other President in history - Dem or GOP - wouldve called &amp; apologized if they even thought they offended a grieving widow. Not this one.
Notice she had a chance to fire back at the President for calling her a liar and didn't. Class personified.

@Adam_Wright23 I would be curious to see a cross-section of where people's taxes go in each taxable year over time
@Adam_Wright23 Philosophically, if you oppose "double taxation," then you should hate making people pay taxes on the taxes they've already paid.
It's after 9 and the #LateNightLegislating continues - in the middle of debate on judicial redistricting bill. Michaux speaking #ncga #ncpol
The same White House that wants to eliminate the estate tax as "double taxation" also wants to tax your taxes. That makes no sense. https://t.co/dSx39mn9GR

@DavidTa84534406 There's so little case law around this, it's not as straightforward as a potential leg challenge.
My prediction: #HB717 may redraw the courts but could very well end up in the courts. Watch this space. 14/14 #ncga #ncpol
In short, while both are "redistricting," leg and judicial operate under totally different rules that can lead to totally diff results. 13/
Also major reduction in number of judges elected from certain urban (read: Dem) counties, such as Durham. 12/
Lots of case law in leg redistricting involves race - doesn't apply in judicial. #HB717 could result in major decrease in black judges. 11/
If this were a leg map, such a huge variation in population would fail constitutionally. Big difference in legislative vs. judicial. 10/
Take a look at Superior Ct map - 41 districts that vary widely in population. One in Meck has 546k people. A district nearby has 88k. 9/ https://t.co/9dEBvvcZm3
So, while leg redistricting involved a lot of criteria, there isn't much law guiding this process. That brings us to today. 8/
I say "necessarily" because a future court could say legislative redistricting case law does apply to judicial. Stay tuned on that. 7/
Most federal case law on "one person, one vote" exists in the legislative redistricting context - doesn't (necessarily) apply for judges 6/
That brings us to federal law and how it affects legislative maps (vs. judicial ones). It's basically a lot of case law vs. very little. 5/
NC constitution is very specific about when leg maps drawn - only in the year after a census. No such req for judicial maps. 4/
For example, the Gov can't veto legislative maps - but can veto judicial ones. Expect these maps to require 3/5 vote to become law. 3/
First, let's start with the NC Constitution. While there's a pretty specific process for leg redistricting, there isn't for judicial. 2/
Remember all those threads I did about legislative redistricting? Judicial redistricting is totally different. Here's how. #ncga #ncpol 1/ https://t.co/RQcuXC52Th
Now, we're starting debate on judicial redistricting. HB 717 would be a complete overhaul of our judicial districts. #ncga #ncpol

Multitasking is the name of the game in 2017. We've gotta walk, and chew gum, and tweet at the same time.
So we've gotta hold our electeds accountable (myself included) on each of these major issues. It's exhausting, but we've gotta do it.
In any normal year, each of these topics would be enough on their own to fill entire news cycle. But this ain't a normal year.
Part of why we're using terms like "distraction" is because 2017 has been a year of political sensory overload. There's ALWAYS something.
We need to discuss how the president behaves. How he responds to racial injustice. How he represents America on a global stage.
So, rather than say "don't discuss Trump," I would say discuss the hurricane victims, too. And healthcare, too. And N. Korea, too.
Many ppl saying "Don't get distracted by Trump's tweets." Makes sense. Still, thru social media we can discuss multiple topics in real time.

RT @CNN: Hurricane Maria ripped the roofs off these homes in San Juan, Puerto Rico https://t.co/VGpWK7tl7e https://t.co/jnt6nRhRXR
I'm praying &amp; hoping for the best in #PuertoRico, but the recovery will prob be long. Let's not forget them when the storm passes. 15/15
Ive spent a lotta time in PR - I call it my home away from home. When I saw #HurricaneMaria's track it shook me bc I knew what it meant. 14/
#Irma came through the island not too long ago. Many lost power and road access that they hadn't got back before #HurricaneMaria struck. 13/
There's a political aspect too. PR is in the middle of a debt crisis. Its infrastructure has suffered from cuts that make it vulnerable. 12/
So you have an intense hurricane cutting across a mountainous island, with a lot of people living in the most intense part of the storm. 11/
Hurricanes are usually strongest on their north-northeastern side. Guess what ended up on the NNE side of #HurricaneMaria? San Juan. 10/
Here's the track of #HurricaneMaria through PR. About 3.5mil people live there, with 1mil people in or around San Juan. 9/ https://t.co/bNsGP3I7nl
In short, rain from #HurricaneMaria is rushing down from the PR mountains quickly, only to hit high sea water on rain-soaked coasts. 8/
Plus, when clouds ride up mtns, they squeeze more water out. Combine that w/ storm surge on nearby coasts. The water has nowhere to go. 7/
#HurricaneMaria is dumping huge amounts of water on PR. Estimates are 2+ ft in some places. That water has to go somewhere. 6/
So, the rain that falls in PR's central mtns goes downhill to the sea really quickly. That brings us to #HurricaneMaria specifically. 5/
In contrast, the tallest mtn east of the Mississippi is here in NC. It's 6,600 ft tall but hundreds of miles from the coast. 4/
For perspective, the tallest mtn in PR is about 4000 feet tall. It's a 20 mile drive from the city of Ponce, which is on the coast. 3/
Physically, PR is an island of stark contrasts. It goes from sea level to mountains in only a few miles. 2/
