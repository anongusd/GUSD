@fredricky @MichealCharmz @atiku @MBuhari Nigeria as a country can't continue to vote base on sympathy we have on politicians.

@fredricky @MichealCharmz @atiku @MBuhari I didn't say @atiku is disrespectful, what I'm saying is his intensity to govern will not work out. His time ia gone and gone forever.

@segalink @atiku Let him do a Nationwide crying festival for his hiden agenda.	What did he do from 1999 to 2007, was he not the one then or was he another person then?	Where was his tears when he was in control within the corridors of power.

@benmurraybruce He is not a member of any three Arms of the government and for his information Sen. Dr. Bukola Saraki is not the problem Nigerians are facing, we have numerous problem which Adams Oshiomhole can clamor for a quicker resolution other than Sarakism in his mouth and agenda.
@benmurraybruce Or a the president of the country to come out and be jumping up and down clamoring for immediate resignation of the senate president or calling for his impeachment as the most priority to him and his party.	What Adams Oshiomhole is and remain is the National Chairman of APC
@benmurraybruce However no body is against sentors impeaching the senate president but all we are asking for is for them that knows the law and constitution to follow the due process of getting the 2/3 of 109 sentors, that's all, but we can't allow someone who is neither a sentor
@benmurraybruce I think @ovieali is totally out of track although that's her best opinion. But may i remind her that Senate President Dr. Bukola Saraki was duly elected as leader of 8th Nigeria National Assembly with the majority of 109 sentors. So provide to us evidence of dubiousness @ovieali

@APCNigeria what are you people doing to checkmate the security decay in Nigeria and the continuous killings in Nigeria.
I challenge the Minister of Transportation Hon. Rotimi Chibuike Amaechi that APC will never win Bauchi, Sokoto,Kano and Rivers State in the forth coming presidential election. @OfficialPDPNig will take over come 2019 comfortable.	@OfficialAPCNg will handover come 2019.
The security situation of Nigeria as a country is decaying, hence the government don't want to take responsibility to address the issues down to the root.	Is highly disturbing that the oath which the took is a fake oath.. to protect lives and properties is not their business.
