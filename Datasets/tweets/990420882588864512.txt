This is great!  Common sense.  Animal abusers should not have animals and this is a great win for safety and good treated animals.  The congressman should celebrate this and quit talking about taking away guns in the context of protecting animals.  But ignore that!  Great news! https://t.co/YbfdlojUCG
Because of this, fewer employees will join the union and those who currently pay dues could stop and get the union benefits.  This will force the union out of existence.  5). They have allowed publicly funded charter schools into this state.  How do they pay for it?  (1/2)
Here is how.  Employees where there is a union do not have to join the union or pay any union dues.  So, those not paying dues can still benefit from collective bargaining done by the union, but without having the same liability as union members.  (1/2)
Studies show that right-to-work has a minuscule, if even existent, impact on job creation.  Studies also show, however, that it DOES depress wages.  A union is there to negotiate better benefits and pay for employees.  Right-to-work is designed to eliminate unions.  (1/2)
4). A right-to-work law.  I want folks to understand the impact of this legislation on union workers.  I call it “right to work for less.”  Five states recently have enacted right to work and all have seen average wages decline.  They bill right-to-work as job creation.  (1/2)

Rocky Adkins is against charter schools.  We are underfunding public education in our state and the only solutions Republicans can offer is creating a second school system run by corporate heads (paid for via public school cuts or tax increases).  Morons!  #RockyAdkinsForGovernor
Rocky Adkins is tough-on-crime, voting to increase drug penalties; is a member of the National Rifle Association; voted to for a ban on abortion at eleven weeks; is pro-nuclear energy development; is a proponent of coal tax incentives.  A common sense Kentuckian.  #VoteRocky
Our last great governor was Paul E. Patton.  What was he before his governorship?  A profitable coal businessman who fought against the severance tax.  Who has he endorsed for governor?  Rocky Adkins—the only candidate from coal country.  #VoteCoal &amp; #VoteRockyAdkins4Governor
Mr. President, you are a weak-kneed chicken-livered turncoat numbskull.  Do you truly care this little about those victimized by criminal illegal immigrants.  We want a wall, you want a wall, and by darn we thought you would get us one and Make America Safe Again.  What a lie!
Our immigration officers tell us that fencing is a key component of a secure border.  So, my plan authorizes around $15B for constructing of new fencing and refurbishment of old fencing.  This will help get us on track to a secure border and a secure America.  #Jonas4Potus
My plan for immigration focuses on security and enforcement.  It includes a mandatory nationwide electronic verification system (E-Verify) so that employers know the immigration status of their employees &amp; it stiffly penalizes employers of illegal aliens.  #Jonas4Potus
One fourth of the earned income tax credit is improper payments.  We should replace the standard deduction &amp; earned income credit with a refundable earnings credit for your first $20,000 of between 20-30% depending on children to boost wages for low-income families.  #Jonas4POTUS
Cutting taxes for Americans is just good common sense.  I want a cut in payroll tax, income, corporate, &amp; capital gains rates.  This would be offset by closing expenditures in the tax code but also by growth in the economy, boosting waged &amp; revenue.  #Jonas4POTUS
We should strive to make our tax code the most pro-business in the world.  So, we should cut their tax rate to a 15% flat rate on business profits.  This would raise wages and grow our economy, thus boosting government revenue while cutting taxes.  #Jonas4POTUS
Tax credits are a common sense solution to help coal companies offset their adverse environmental effects.  I am proposing tax credits for carbon capture and sequestration &amp; coal gasification to cut gas prices, create coal jobs, &amp; cut emissions.  #Jonas4POTUS
My tax plan cuts the payroll tax to 5%, cuts the top income tax rate to 25%, the corporate rate to 15%, &amp; the top capital gains rate to 15% paid for by taxing employment healthcare as wages, capping itemized deductions, &amp; repealing the payroll tax cap.  #Jonas4POTUS
The child tax credit is a powerful tool for low-income families to reduce their federal tax liability.  My tax proposal would increase the child tax credit to $2,200 with the entire credit refundable.  Also important, it would phase in at the first dollar of income.  #Jonas4POTUS

With this true, and coal jobs vanishing and with them coal miners being put out of work at a rapid rate, particularly in Eastern Kentucky, I think having an old-time Eastern Kentuckian from a coal county would be better than a climate change stalwart.  #RockyAdkinsForGovernor

It is not immoral.  If it was it wound likely not surround the domiciles of our ruling class.  It is not uneconomical.  If it was those thieves and penny pinchers would not surround there houses with it.  Anyway, if you wanna oppose this wall, just ask yourself one thing:
President Trump just know I stand with you here.  Whether it is trade, energy, taxes, healthcare, foreign policy, whatever, we do not always see eye to eye.  But I will not exploit that and try to make national security a partisan issue.  We need a wall.

John Kasich please stop!  Just shut up for now, for once!  I viewed you more favorably than the president in the primary.  But don’t tell him to be more “flexible” or to “compromise” on border security.  He’s asking for 1/5 of what he wanted and offered DACA citizenship.
@BertaCamal That is dangerous rhetoric that unnecessarily inflames and inflates an already divisive situation.  Please explain how President Trump is a traitor.
@BertaCamal Well you should learn to be a decent, civil human being and agreeably disagree in a respectful manner with the sincerely held duties and beliefs of others.
And opposition to base-broadening, rate cutting tax reform, I believe that Rocky Adkins, a genuine and dedicated public servant from Sandy Hook who puts people above politics, unlike Gov. Matt Bevin, is the best man for the job.  I hope he wins the Democratic Primary.  Please!
Mr. Adkins promises to bring “common sense solutions for our good old commonwealth” and listed infrastructure &amp; public education as his two priorities if he becomes governor.  While I do have concerns with his opposition to school choice expansion
I am proud to endorse State Rep. Rocky Adkins for governor in our 2019 election.  An old fashioned Democrat, Mr. Adkins is steadfast in his opposition to abortion and support of gun rights, and he is proud to stand for public schools and a secure retirement for our educators.
Look, it is time for us to reopen the part of the government that is closed.  But I do not blame this on the president.  He offered the Democrats a quite generous deal offering amnesty to recipients of the DACA program in exchange for $25B for border security.  Pass THAT bill!

@DaRefScottGrady @wdunlap @IngrahamAngle Yeah the Mexico paying for it thing is another lie.  We want the wall because that fence is not nearly complete.
@DaRefScottGrady @wdunlap @IngrahamAngle The fence and wall are the same.  But I think we agree that the Trump-Schumer-Pelosi Shutdown is stupid and an intentionally contrived battle over pretty much nothing.
@DaRefScottGrady @wdunlap @IngrahamAngle Is not
There are accomplishments too, but they are far outweighed by the negatives.  For these reasons, the president has lost my support.
It makes payments to the nieces and nephews of farmers, gives almost insulting price supports to crops like beans and corn that are already being hurt badly by the dismantling of foreign agricultural markets for American goods, and prioritizes mega farms over family farms.  (1/2)
Another issue of concern to me is the tariffs that are driving up costs for consumers and producers and that are doing particular damage to our agricultural industry.  The $867 Billion farm bill that he just signed epitomizes mismanaged programs and no priorities.  (1/2)
Perhaps the most significant effect of the bill is a substantial reduction in the number of folks with health insurance coverage.  I am also beyond tired of constant belittlement and name-calling of those who displease Mr. Trump at that particular moment.  (1/2)
The legislation would also repeal the excise tax on expensive plans without replacing it with a market-based measure to stabilize costs, like equalizing the tax treatment of employer-sponsored health insurance plans and plans in the individual marketplace.  (1/2)
Other portions of the healthcare bill considered last year weaken, in a significant manner, coverage for pre-existing conditions.  The bill required insurance companies to cover those with a pre-existing condition, but they would not be required to cover the condition.  (1/2)
The goal of healthcare reform should be increasing the quality, accessibility, and affordability of healthcare in the United States.  Pre-established spending caps for the Medicaid program that do not account for the needs of the Medicaid population reduce care quality.  (1/2)
The tax bill did not do this.  The president stopped paying the cost-sharing subsidies in the Affordable Care Act (ACA) as a political stunt to sabotage what is a fundamentally flawed law, but did so without a real replacement proposal.  (1/2)
I am a supporter of reducing the tax burden borne by our citizenry but tax reform should focus on substantial tax relief for middle income taxpayers &amp; contribute to deficit reduction by reducing tax expenditures, like deductions, exemptions, credits, &amp; loopholes.  (1/2)
These cuts are irresponsible and are not measured, &amp; furthermore they do not lead to a budget that will balance.  The problem was exacerbated tremendously by tax legislation that increases the debt of our nation by $1.5 Trillion.  (1/2)
The spending cuts he proposes are diminishing federal support for public education, converting the food stamps program into boxes of food given to beneficiaries, and pre-established caps on Medicaid spending that do not account for the actual needs of the program.  (1/2)
This will result in a power vacuum that will be filled by ISIS and other terrorist groups.  Budget deficits under this president are projected to exceed $1 Trillion Dollars and he refuses to explore responsible ways to reduce entitlement and defense spending.  (1/2)
I cannot support President Donald Trump any longer.  This reckless withdrawal from Syria endangers our nation and will contribute to and exacerbate the rebuilding of ISIS and the reclamation of land by it that we had formerly retaken.  (1/2)
@DaRefScottGrady @wdunlap @IngrahamAngle Yet they voted for one nonetheless so that is irrelevant.
@DaRefScottGrady @wdunlap @IngrahamAngle Secure Fence Act of 2006 got 80 votes.  The Economic Opportunity &amp; Immigration Modernization bill in 2013 got every Dem vote &amp; had $46 Billion for border security including fencing.
@stillwaters777 @wdunlap @IngrahamAngle That’s right it’s all politics anymore

@heliko_pteron @RepPerlmutter @realDonaldTrump Because if more illegals come in (and they get their way &amp; they become citizens) the demography will favor Democrats more because a minority underclass dependent on the welfare state is just the boost the Democrats need.

@ArcaneKnowledge @AdamSchiff I just said we ought to have reduced tax expenditures and (I plan on running for President some day) I have a plan to reduce Medicare outlays by $1 Trillion, Medicaid outlays by $1 Trillion, and Social Security Reform.
@ArcaneKnowledge @AdamSchiff Every rate but the very bottom was lowered.  It also benefits workers because the business tax cuts will give them more money to hire more people &amp; raise wages which creates good-paying jobs.  Good combo.  Need to reduce tax expenditures dramatically tho so as not to hike debt!
@ArcaneKnowledge @AdamSchiff Tax cuts for everybody.  Ur right the veterans bills aren’t working.  And it was about time we recognized the rightful capital of Israel.
@ArcaneKnowledge @AdamSchiff Lots of presidential successes: Jerusalem, veterans, GDP, wage growth, tax cuts, taking a chainsaw to red tape, energy independence.  Lots of failures too: early release bill, farm bill, omnibus spending bill, deficit, debt, the tax bill, the healthcare bill, Korea, tariffs, etc.
@ArcaneKnowledge @AdamSchiff I wholeheartedly agree with that.  We need more businessmen in government.  There is one exception to what you just said: Donald J. Trump!
@ArcaneKnowledge @AdamSchiff But since any economic achievements are Obama’s doing according to you folks (and those who credit Trump are racist Nazis, of course), would such a downturn not be the fault of Obama?
@HeyitsTwinDrake @AndyOstroy @realDonaldTrump It is a Democratic republic.  That’s what it’s called.  It also a constitutional republic, duh, since we have a Constitution!  Now I know you’re for dismantling that particular document, but for now it’s still right here!
@ArcaneKnowledge @AdamSchiff I can find conspiracies too.  Did you know Ted Cruz’s father killed JFK?  Also I have documentation that Obama is a Kenyan!  Had you heard?
@ArcaneKnowledge @AdamSchiff If Obama had his way 17000 coal miners in my state would not have some wage, they would have no wage, then this crap wouldn’t matter.  They are glad to be on the job that Obama would have taken out from under them.

@IowaPeg @natashancn @SenJackReed No I wanna secure the border not give money to Mexico and Central America.  A wall (or triple-layer fencing), lateral access roads, more Border Patrol officers, more technology &amp; surveillance WILL stop 95% of crossings and if done right that is the truth.

@SRoddy1171 @SenJackReed Absolutely build that wall.  We spend thousands per illegal immigrant.

@lisheness_jane @gggrinder77 @SenTedCruz @SenSchumer Well thank you!
@lisheness_jane @gggrinder77 @SenTedCruz @SenSchumer That’s right.  It does not matter how we are oriented politically, what color we are, where we’re from, man or woman, anything.  We’re all Americans and all our hearts bleed red, white, &amp; blue, and that’s what kept this country as the shining beacon of liberty that it is.
@lisheness_jane @gggrinder77 @SenTedCruz @SenSchumer I certainly wish the best for us all as well.
@lisheness_jane @gggrinder77 @SenTedCruz @SenSchumer Whatever.  Just keep believing that
@lisheness_jane @gggrinder77 @SenTedCruz @SenSchumer That’s just a dumb statement.  Obama had scandals Bush had scandals Clinton had scandals and they all made horrible decisions at one time or another
@lisheness_jane @gggrinder77 @SenTedCruz @SenSchumer That’s uncorroborated &amp; false but this move is a cataclysmic disaster
@PhilDavisSC @LindseyGrahamSC Sure
@lisheness_jane @gggrinder77 @SenTedCruz @SenSchumer And that fact is despicable, disgraceful, disgusting, and inconsistent with our American values of civility and decency in both our politics and our lives.
@lisheness_jane @gggrinder77 @SenTedCruz @SenSchumer And NO he can only use money Congress appropriates and border security is under the Department of Homeland Security!  Facts!
@lisheness_jane @gggrinder77 @SenTedCruz @SenSchumer Hi Syria move is an incompetent and reckless geopolitical anomaly that will spontaneously annihilate the tremendous successes and gains this commander-in-chief has made in the war to destroy ISIS.  It is the same recklessness and weakness he criticized Obama for in Iraq!
@PhilDavisSC @LindseyGrahamSC That was rather moronic.
Please Mr. President.  The deeds and words you have promulgated of late are costing you my support + the support of our nation and its allies.  You have had tremendous success against ISIS but a reckless abandonment like that of Iraq by Obama will spontaneously annihilate that! https://t.co/OWyXMBd5dg
@lisheness_jane @gggrinder77 @SenTedCruz @SenSchumer He can’t do that because it is part of the homeland security budget and Congress appropriates money not the president.  Besides if he did that you would call him an unconstitutional autocratic dictator, the spawn of Satan and kin of Hitler.  Not that simple.
@gggrinder77 @lisheness_jane @SenTedCruz @SenSchumer @FoxNews It is not the only solution, and Mexico paying for it was a lie and annoying fraudulent claim, but the fact is it is still an integral part of the solution to a complex problem facing our nation.
@gggrinder77 @lisheness_jane @SenTedCruz @SenSchumer @FoxNews If you had done your research you would understand that illegal immigrant is a huge problem that depresses American wages and costs us money and lives and you would care enough about your fellow Americans to support common sense border security like fencing or a wall.
@lisheness_jane @gggrinder77 @SenTedCruz @SenSchumer But this isn’t in the defense budget it is in the homeland security budget
@motocoaster @ledtear @Sen_JoeManchin That’s a load of crap.  The fentanyl that criminal illegals are smuggling in here is actually shortening our life expectancy!
@lisheness_jane @gggrinder77 @SenTedCruz @SenSchumer Look we can’t have open borders.  The border has to be secure.  &amp; the Washington Democrats wanna play petty politics to prevent an integral part of that, which is a wall (walls work ask Israel) then any shutdown is on them.
@lisheness_jane @gggrinder77 @SenTedCruz @SenSchumer For his wall that’s right and I will be proud of him &amp; keep in mind it’s just a third of the govt
@gggrinder77 @lisheness_jane @SenTedCruz @SenSchumer I tell you they are raising a lot of money that’s for sure
@lisheness_jane @gggrinder77 @SenTedCruz @SenSchumer I support a comprehensive package for 30,000 more ICE officers, triple layer fencing, lateral access roads, increased checkpoints, technology, aerial surveillance, E-Verify, and stopping sanctuary cities, along with giving legal status to the DACA kids.
@lisheness_jane @gggrinder77 @SenTedCruz @SenSchumer Well this is a real wall not a sample.  Ask Israel, walls good.  Not only solution, but major part.
@BelindaSilva @TERESAWEBB2 @SenTedCruz @SenSchumer That’s right
@gggrinder77 @SenTedCruz @SenSchumer Because all of those are correct.
@gggrinder77 @SenTedCruz @SenSchumer About which thing?
@j_r_mitch @SenTedCruz @SenSchumer He just won a month ago are you in fantasyland?
@butaric_ana @SenTedCruz @SenSchumer So you aren’t murdered by a criminal illegal, DUH!
@jsyoung72 @SenTedCruz @SenSchumer 1) The Senate will not follow.  If you think there’s much chance of a Senate flip in 2020 you may be incompetent.  The House could flip back though.		2) He is being a team player.  All he asked for is $5B (down from $25B) for a border security wall.  That is so reasonable!
@tdappel @SenTedCruz @SenSchumer Ted doesn’t need to ask Pete Sessions or NOT SENATOR BETO.  I would say SENATOR CRUZ heard the message from Texas!
@TERESAWEBB2 @SenTedCruz @SenSchumer Finally I found another conservative on here!  You made my day!
@gggrinder77 @SenTedCruz @SenSchumer You do understand we are dickering over 1/600th of 1% if expenditures in the federal budget.  And the majority does want a wall and certainly wants border security, of which the wall is an integral component.
@MichaelLTeller @Alexocasocortez @SenateGOP @SenateDems @SenSchumer @SenFeinstein She probably does not have a house.  I would say she lives underwater and does not eat but rather produces her own energy supply by harvesting water and solar resources.
@Alexocasocortez @SenateGOP @SenateDems @SenSchumer @SenFeinstein And how do you know this?  Do you understand this as well as you understand unemployment since you said the unemployment rate was low because people were working two jobs?  Ask Israel, walls work!
@Repbeth1 @SenateGOP @SenateDems @SenSchumer @SenFeinstein The current appropriations bill passed by the House of Representatives appropriates $5.7 Billion for the Wall.
@Repbeth1 @SenateGOP @SenateDems @SenSchumer @SenFeinstein That is incorrect.  He needed 60 votes in the Senate which would have required 9 Democrats to support it.  And I am pretty sure the only Democrat in the country who does is me (and maybe Joe Manchin)!
@Zkuy8888 @RepSwalwell I am afraid of your profile picture.
@Bjorkian15 @RepSwalwell Do you folks even think rationally?
@RepSwalwell Wanting to change a Senate rule to pass an amendment to an appropriations bill to fund a border security measure does not make the President of the United States incapable of discharging the duties of his office.  Sorry to burst your bubble!
@kyle_bracken1 @AdamSchiff @BaileySam Actually was not the argument.  It may be ANTIFA’s talking point but isn’t a valid legal argument.  Also, the Constitution does mention discrimination despite its unpleasantness.  There’s other pre existing conditions &amp; they affect all races.  Folks of any color are born with em.
@kyle_bracken1 @AdamSchiff @BaileySam No you don’t pay the PENALTY anymore thanks to good GOP amendments to the tax cut bill.  And obviously we support some taxation because otherwise there would be public roads, public schools, defense, R &amp; D, things like that. If we had wanted no taxes, we would’ve abolished taxes!
@kyle_bracken1 @AdamSchiff @BaileySam You are correct that the taxing power of congress permits them to levy some taxes.  It does not permit them to level penalties, especially penalties of zero.
@kyle_bracken1 @AdamSchiff @BaileySam The Constitution is blind to our policy preferences.  And while the ACA may have been intended to reduce costs, it has done the opposite.  You care about protecting the liberal agenda and talking points than the Constitution and actually cutting healthcare costs for families.
It’s time to walk the walk because you have consistently been talking the talk.  But if you are serious about border security, of which a wall is an integral component, VETO this bill and date Congress to override it!
President Trump, please VETO this “compromise” funding bill.  If you sign it, SHUT UP about border security.  This goes against what you have been promising and the time to pick this fight is now.  You are now asking for 1/5 of what you originally asked for for  the wall.
So glad the special session adjourned with no bill!  Great news!  Now maybe you all will listen and protect pension benefits (not have your banker friends invest them), not cut the benefits teachers get, protect retirement health insurance that you keep trying to eliminate!
@kyle_bracken1 @AdamSchiff @BaileySam What does that have to do with anything?
@kyle_bracken1 @AdamSchiff @BaileySam Because the individual mandate penalty (not tax no matter what John Roberts says) was eliminated and therefore unconstitutional under the Commerce &amp; Necessary and Proper Clause (as SCOTUS said) and not encompassed by congress’s taxing power as they previously said.
@sherrybb @LMYomama @realDonaldTrump And I was supportive of those provisions that reduced the overpayment of providers for Medicare beneficiaries to eliminate the doughnut hole in Medicare Part D coverage.  That was a good part of the legislation and it can be expanded upon.
@sherrybb @LMYomama @realDonaldTrump But we don’t think folks with pre-existing conditions ought to be held hostage to the ACA.  We want to replace with legislation that both cuts costs &amp; protects pre-existing conditions.
@sherrybb @LMYomama @realDonaldTrump Actually under the ACA premiums deductibles and copayments have increased quite immensely.
@sherrybb @LMYomama @realDonaldTrump No the GOP cut 0 from Medicare and there were tax cuts for every-body.
@sherrybb @LMYomama @realDonaldTrump And so does he.  We just don’t think that those with pre-existing conditions ought to be held hostage to the high costs of the Unaffordable Care Act.  Any new healthcare reform must, though, include such protections.
@sherrybb @LMYomama @realDonaldTrump 1) There is no lawsuit “fighting to take away pre-existing conditions.”  It is questioning the constitutionality of Obamacare and so far has been successful.	2) Also, repealing the individual mandate DOES NOT impact Medicare.	3) I believe in protections for pre-existing condition
@sherrybb @LMYomama @realDonaldTrump It is impacts the ACA but it has nothing to do with the $716 Billion Medicare cut in the ACA.
@kyle_bracken1 @AdamSchiff @BaileySam How is Judge O’Connor violating any amendments?  And it has been to the Supreme Court but the law has been altered since then.
@stglsh1 Then you know who would have been impeached?  Barack Hussein Obama.  And not Donald John Trump.  And there is no evidence of Russia collusion; merely prosecutorial bias, an unconstitutional investigation, Hillary Clinton &amp; the DNC buying Russian lies, and other such incidences.
@stglsh1 It did not claim to know everything.  But Congressman Swalwell does not either.  Using personal money during a campaign as hush money is gross but it is not a crime and it is certainly not impeachable.  If we were impeaching for Campaign Finance violations (which this is not)
@UghToHillary @TrishaFenn @realDonaldTrump I can’t even picture that much money!
@woman215 @TrishaFenn @realDonaldTrump Cutting rates grows the economy.  That top individual rate is the rate at which the creators of a quarter of America’s jobs are taxed.  It needed to be cut to expand our economy.  So that was a good part but it needed to be deficit-neutral or deficit-reducing.
@woman215 @TrishaFenn @realDonaldTrump Now you’re putting words in my mouth.  I opposed that particular tax cut bill because it does add to the deficit and because it failed to simplify the tax code, bringing in revenue trapped overseas, and reduce wasteful expenditures so we can lower rates in a measured way.
@TrishaFenn @realDonaldTrump Socialistic ideas that can never be paid for even if you all got the 95% tax rate on the wealthy that you probably want.  You want free college, healthcare, housing, everything, I’m sure, for everybody!  Newsflash.  Socialism doesn’t work and you can’t pay for that!
@TrishaFenn @realDonaldTrump But that adds $33 Trillion to the debt.  That eliminates choice.  It reduces quality.  It is all around a horrendous idea.
@LMYomama @realDonaldTrump 1) Not 7 Years.  He has been in office for just under 2 Years.		2) He has passed no legislation on Social Security or Medicare so there is not any way he could have “[made] them worse.”
@MyBigFatMouth @whirlygirlsx2 @realDonaldTrump Please elaborate how a tweet is illegal, please, please.  I really lack words for this one.  How can a tweet be illegal?
This type of reckless rhetoric filled with misconceptions and untruths is reducing civility in our political discourse and system.  You may not agree with President Trump, but he is not treasonous, nor a criminal, nor a Nazi, nor a fascist, nor an autocrat, nor Hitler.  Stop. https://t.co/qJCFIBdDAF
Other transgressions would also be eligible for this early release.  I support providing vocational and technical education &amp; training programs for offenders and for encouraging rehabilitation during incarceration, but not if it means turning such violent criminals loose #VoteNo
Under the proposed legislation, major traffickers of cocaine, heroin, methamphetamine, &amp; fentanyl (which is actually reducing our life expectancy) would be eligible for VERY early release.  Those who committed crimes like assault with intent to rape, carjacking, and a host of
From what I know about the First Step Act that passed the House of Representatives, it was a solid piece of legislation.  However, I can no longer support it because a bipartisan coalition of senators transformed it into an early release &amp; sentencing reduction bill. https://t.co/zRqArbNkLB
@soqrbrad @SenCoryGardner Actually President Trump agrees with Senator Gardner on this issue.  I disagree with both of them (and I support both of them a lot of the time) but they do in fact seem to agree on this.
Subsidies and providing tax credits for long-term insurance.  It means finding practical ways to protect coverage for those of us with pre-existing conditions.  That means comprehensive reform of Medicaid and Medicare to make those programs sustainable.  So let’s get to work!
Obamacare is unconstitutional.  That means we need to come together to find good solutions to lower healthcare costs for American families.  That means association health plans for small businesses and competition across state lines.  That means continuing to pay the cost-sharing https://t.co/1j5YoTzBc5
Let’s secure our border and elude a government shutdown.  Senator Schumer, unite your caucus to support this wall that you supported before and stop playing politics.  I, and the president, wanna keep the American people safe—I challenge you to join us. https://t.co/CQ7owlIkv4

Our governor, Matt Bevin, has just called the legislature into session to vote on more pension reform after Round 1 was ruled unconstitutional.  Please Governor and Legislature earn people’s support and support our great teachers.  Work with Democrats and find a fair solution!
@Look_See_Think @AdamSchiff No studies show it costs $33Trillion in deficit/debt spending.  And it eliminates choices.  And it reduces quality.  And it’s an atrocious idea.
@Sarahs_eyebrows @AdamSchiff @paulguy6 Nah Shifty Schiff the biggest liar in America would be toast.
@Sarahs_eyebrows @AdamSchiff @paulguy6 That would be Trump’s dream!
@HollowReed19 @AdamSchiff @joncoopertweets What’s that got to do with literally anything?
@catsleno @AdamSchiff And neither do you.
@catsleno @AdamSchiff No.
@Jillymoe @AdamSchiff @_StandUpNow But I suppose you thought one liberal activist judge in Hawaii should be able to block President Trump’s travel ban that SCOTUS upheld, huh?
@kavarney113 @AdamSchiff Did you have civics in school?  A judge strikes down a law is he determines it violates the U.S. Constitution.  The ACA violated the Commerce Clause as well as the Taxing and Spending Clause.  Therefore, it violates the Constitution and is legally invalid.
@Kboyk @AdamSchiff He waited until he had made his decision.  Judge Reed O’Connor is not bound to his own political orientation, social fads, or politics when he interprets the Constitution, in start contrast to y’all’s liberal activist “judges.”
@Tomolsotwit31 @AdamSchiff And what law would that be?  President Trump has not signed any law that had anything to do with judges and his healthcare reform law did not pass so please enlighten me on the nonexistent piece of legislation about which you have rather ignorantly decided to comment.
@HDrickhamer @AdamSchiff This is why we need civics in school!  Judges strike down laws if they violate the Constitution under the separation of powers and checks and balances.  The ACA violated the Taxing and Spending Clause + the Commerce Clause, so it is unconstitutional and therefore not valid law.
@kyle_bracken1 @AdamSchiff @BaileySam And then to the Supreme Court.
@kyle_bracken1 @AdamSchiff @BaileySam I do not think you understand how the federal judiciary functions.  See he is a FEDERAL district judge in Texas so he hears the case filed in federal court (since it is a challenge to a federal law) by the Attorney General of Texas.  Then it can be appealed to the 5th Circuit...
@KLB60 @AdamSchiff Well the ACA was struck down because, unlike many liberal activist judges, Judge Reed O’Connor follows the Constitution and not his policy preferences.  Everyone wants to protect pre-existing conditions, but we just want to do it without the disaster of Obamacare.
@Deborahgriewsk1 @AdamSchiff And the high court has already ruled the individual mandate unconstitutional under the Commerce Clause.  Furthermore, Judge Reed O’Connor ruled that the rest of the law was not severable and therefore threw out the whole thing.  The Medicaid reimbursements are still being paid.
@Deborahgriewsk1 @AdamSchiff Exercise of congressional power under the Commerce Clause (referring to the individual mandate) but it was a valid exercise of congressional power under the Taxing and Spending Clause.  Now that the tax is repealed, it has nothing to do with the Taxing and Spending Clause
@Deborahgriewsk1 @AdamSchiff That is a fundamental untruth and misunderstanding of the ruling.  The bill was held constitutional in 2012 because the individual mandate penalty was found to be a tax, despite President Obama insisting that it was not.  Five justices agreed that the legislation was not a valid
@Look_See_Think @AdamSchiff So we need to add $33 Trillion to our massive national debt?  The Affordable Care Act was not the solution.  Medicare For All is not the solution.  TrumpCare is also NOT the solution.  We need a bipartisan effort to cut costs for families and strengthen the private marketplace.
Mr. President, you said you would be proud to shut down the government for your wall.  Would you also be proud to look for and find a compromise or would you rather shut down the government?  @foxnewssunday

Suppression on the rest of us.  The Homosexual Agenda and its well funded liberal elitist allies apparently on a Virginia school board subservient to those dedicated to the politically correct has fired a great high school teacher for declining to overrule the school biology
Seeing Obamacare was found to be unconstitutional I was ready to celebrate.  But then I made the mistake of continuing to watch the news and done got myself outraged again.  I am tired of liberal socialists radicals imposing their political correctness and gender-binding
@karencollinsnyc @RepSwalwell Explain to me, please, how cutting taxes for workers and businesses is bad for workers.
Reforms like wellness incentives, reshape healthcare subsidies in the form of need-based tax credits, and stand up against socialism.  That is my recipe for success.  Nancy, Kevin, Mitch, Chuck, Donald, Mike, let’s get to work!
Additionally, put that spending cap on Medicaid, pass medical malpractice reform so we don’t have so much defensive medicine, create a streamlined electronic medical records system, streamline the approval process for getting generic drugs on the market, pass other Medicaid
3. Expand healthcare choices.  Of course, the first step in doing this is allowing health insurance providers to compete across state lines.  That is just common sense.  Plus, with more money in their pockets from tax cuts, folks can afford options that cost a little more.
Insurance (but maybe can with an association health plan) can hire, not fire, more people b/c the mandate that businesses of 50+ employees provide insurance has caused many small businesses to trim their workforce to under 50 employees.
We ought to simplify and expand options for small businesses to provide employer health insurance by encouraging the formation of association health plans.  We can do this further by repealing the onerous employer mandate so small businesses that cannot afford to provide health
Repeal the onerous tax hike on the capital gains of high-income taxpayers to further incentivize the expansion of our booming economy.  And repeal the other 17 new taxes or tax hikes as well!		2. Support our small businesses.
1. No new or increased taxes.  Repeal the 2.3% tax on medical devices so that those thousands of medical device manufacturing jobs can come back to the United States.   Repeal the 40% tax on high cost health plans so that individuals really can keep their plan.
So I urge our new Democratic House of Representatives and our Republican Senate to come together to craft a bipartisan package of healthcare reform measures under a fundamental set of principles.  Read my next tweet for those principles:
Companies to cover pre-existing conditions, but rather to set up state-managed high-risk pools under federal guidelines to ensure that those individuals with pre-existing conditions shut out of the private insurance marketplace can obtain quality coverage.
costs would save $800 Billion + over the course of a decade.  We all support protections for those of us with pre-existing conditions, but the means by which those protections were established under Obamacare are faulty.  The way to go is not a blanket mandate on the insurance
Large part to Obamacare expanding Medicaid without correcting structural and funding imbalances within the program.  Covering 100% of Medicaid expansion costs in a joint federal-state program means it is not a federal-state program.  Had they set a per-enrollee cap on Medicaid
Our medical device industry by taxing medical devices—it put a sin (excise) tax on catheters &amp; other medical devices.  Good, comprehensive health plans are now unaffordable because they are subject, thanks to Obama-care, to a 40% excise tax.  The deficit is ballooning due in
To strike down this horrendous law.  It is time for Congress to act.  Co-payments are up, premiums are up, &amp; deductibles are up.  Obama promised costs would go down but they have increased at a quicker and quickening pace.  Medical innovation is down since Obamacare dismantled
Breaking news out of the Great State of Texas.  Woo!  And thank you Ken Paxton, Texas AG!  The disaster of Obamacare has been correctly ruled unconstitutional.  It is about time.  Chief Justice Roberts will you once again join left wing radicals or will you join the Cobstitution
the embassy moved to Jerusalem,  tax cuts for all Americans, unemployment and poverty plummeting, wages rising, small business confidence at an all time high, taking a chainsaw to burdensome regulations, and fighting to secure our border.  Thank you President Trump!

@shuga_c @SenRonJohnson Ever heard of competition or choice.  Just because it doesn’t meet your satisfaction doesn’t mean someone else can’t choose it.  That’s an individual’s right.  The voters of Wisconsin preferred him and Trump to Nutsy Russ so you’ll have to get over it!

I am making my first endorsement this election, officially.  Marsha Blackburn of Tennessee will and must beat Liberal Phil to preserve our Senate majority.  Marsha is strong on life, taxes, crime, border, deregulation, marriage, spending, &amp; energy.  She is right for Tennesseans!
Now think, one of these things is a good platform.  One isn’t.  You’ll have to decide which is which.
What do the Democrats want?  They want to repeal the tax cuts, they want to impeach President Trump and Justice Kavanaugh, they want endless investigations into uncorroborated allegations against anyone with an R beside their name, and they want to obstruct our POTUS.
Keep in mind the significance of our vote this November.  The GOP wants to make the tax cuts for both individuals and businesses permanent, they want universal savings accounts, they want to repeal and replace Obamacare, &amp; they want to cut onerous red tape and regulations.

@PattyHarbison @GovMikeHuckabee @realDonaldTrump @POTUS 17 years ago Bush was in office.  I know you folks suffer from Trump derangement disorder but I did not know that took away your math skills.  Obama was the 1st 2-term president in modern times not to have a year averaging over 3% GDP.  Some job he did.	#TrumpTaxCutsMadeItHappen
@SenateMajLdr Gees!  Get a life!
@deepdvr1234 @JeffFlake Kavanaugh is right and John McCain said so.
@LoriHay31331523 @JeffFlake That’s a dumb argument.  Idiotic hyper partisan Republicans we’re filing articles of impeachment against Obama when he nominated (and got confirmed) Elena Kagan (during an election year).  No outrage!
@ZRuthigs @realDonaldTrump Keep looking forward to it cause it ain’t gonna occur
We should all, regardless of politics, pay our respects and thank for our service the late senator John McCain who passed away today and hope that his now 106 year old mother will be okay.
@AdamSchiffCA Dummy.  Go join CalExit!
Happy birthday to Gov. Mike Huckabee, a great moral man and a strong conservative, and a man worthy of the utmost bipartisan respect for his diligent and unequivocal work for the betterment of Arkansas and all Arkansas and for his biblical aspirations for our great country!
Time for Rosenstein to go! https://t.co/XIaPKXVjnL
@AdamSchiffCA You are a liar.  No evidence of the so-called collusion.  Politically motivated incoherent witch hunt.  And the president, just as do both parties (I think since you collided with Russia) condemns interference.
@AdamSchiffCA Actually the aug 3 I.E. report has GOP winning the House.  Biggest Liar in America.
@SenSanders That is incorrect.  This would increase government spending by $33,000,000,000 (33 trillion dollars) and increase the deficit so much that American money would probably be worthless.
David Hogg has no credentials.  Rejected by four colleges.  He has no idea what he is talking about and has no respect for the Bill of Rights.  Hopefully no college accepts him!  Leftist extremists and NRA haters like him are why a red wave is coming in November (or part of why)!

I’m glad some among us can come up with such intelligent and thought-out comebacks to truths. https://t.co/GR7kojzd9o
@MrDGMason @DEn8tive77 @SenateMajLdr @realDonaldTrump Obama did not.  It seems absurd that one can construe the Constitution of our Judeo-Christian forefathers to mandate states license and respect what I call parody unions.  Obama appointed progressive judges who decide what they wish the law and/or Constitution said.
@MrDGMason @DEn8tive77 @SenateMajLdr @realDonaldTrump That’s what the Founders wanted.
@MrDGMason @DEn8tive77 @SenateMajLdr @realDonaldTrump They do not endeavor whatsoever in “conservative activism.”  A good conservative judge, such as them, interprets the law as written and the Constitution as written.  They do not create policies or new laws from the bench—that’s our idiot Congress’s job.
@SteveHaweeli @SenateMajLdr @realDonaldTrump Because it is a perjury trap in a bias witch hunt.
@MrDGMason @DEn8tive77 @SenateMajLdr @realDonaldTrump Ask the Democrats who oppose any nominee who fails to partake in judicial activism.
@SteveHaweeli @SenateMajLdr @realDonaldTrump I’m not ok with Russian meddling!  We are sanctioning Russia.  Pres. signed sanctions.  But POTUS did not collude!
@HughRomine @SenateMajLdr @realDonaldTrump Wrong.  It had been over 80 yrs since a lame duck president successfully appointed a justice.  Lyndon Johnson tried to make Fortas Chief Justice in the 60s but that was for the same reason rejected.
@MrDGMason @SenateMajLdr @realDonaldTrump No that’s favoring one person or thing and unconstitutionally entitling both parties to a bias and unfair trial.  Sometimes the “little guy” wins and sometimes the “big” guy wins.  Just how it is.  Interpreting the law and deciding every case free from arbitrariness is justice!
@55MackJS @SenateMajLdr @realDonaldTrump Right
@SunnJax @SenateMajLdr @realDonaldTrump Please enlighten me.
@RichardCDemerle @SenateMajLdr @realDonaldTrump Many of which were Obama appointed due to Democratic obstruction of President Bush’s nominees!
@SteveHaweeli @SenateMajLdr @realDonaldTrump Maybe.  They do have college courses for it as I’m sure you’re unaware.
@mkvand @SenateMajLdr @realDonaldTrump Actually Democrats obstructed Bush’s incredible nominees thanks to shithole chairman Patrick Leahy calling them “racist” while we let activist morons control the system under The Kenyan Muslim Regime!
@jderu7 @SenateMajLdr @BeverlyMcCord2 @realDonaldTrump I agree but without these judges liberal activist courts might declare those great policies “unconstitutional.”
@HughRomine @SenateMajLdr @realDonaldTrump Abuse of power?
@dollyp724 @SenateMajLdr @realDonaldTrump None.  And Mueller’s partisan bias witch hunt will jail no one for “collusion.”
@MrDGMason @SenateMajLdr @realDonaldTrump I suppose you’d rather see a liberal activist judiciary that was on track to dominate should a liberal in the mold of our first Kenyan to hold the office of the presidency take office!
@SenateMajLdr @realDonaldTrump Awesome!  Big wins for conservatism!
By an Oregon House candidate, she was called a name so false, disgusting, dishonorable, low (even for the left) and vile that I will not repeat it.  But you silence the views of social and fiscal conservatives like Rep. Matt Gaetz.  Reminiscent of Stalin!
Twitter if you’re listening you people are disgusting and a conspiring totalitarian internet liberal extreme wing propagandist regime attempting to silence conservatives and encourage liberal animals and animosity that calls our beautiful and admirable First Lady heinous names...
@RepSwalwell @realDonaldTrump Collude*
@RepSwalwell @realDonaldTrump And you’re also wrong.  Unlike Hillary he didn’t collide with Russia.  She however payed Christopher Steele to get dirt on Trump from the Russians (the DNC also payed for this).  What’s clear is a Deep State conspiracy to elect Clinton and defeat Trump!
@RepSwalwell @realDonaldTrump You’re a propagandist asshole with a rock for a brain!
@2foodie @JodyD53797808 @pink_lady56 @AdamSchiffCA I’m not a bot just more intelligent than you.

@M5B1tch @Robertgsr44 @pink_lady56 @AdamSchiffCA I know to preserve our constitution our advice was don’t nominate anyone and our consent was summarily dismissing an extremist nominee!
@ingramjr @pink_lady56 @AdamSchiffCA We have the majority and Manchin just told Schumer to kiss his a** he’s voting 4 Kavanaugh so elections have consequences
@zedism @pink_lady56 @AdamSchiffCA I wouldn’t say citizens necessarily

@Robertgsr44 @M5B1tch @pink_lady56 @AdamSchiffCA There’s a reason why we said no to garland and yes to gorsuch!
@Robertgsr44 @M5B1tch @pink_lady56 @AdamSchiffCA And if that fails they take their extremist causes to their activist courts!
@SFDukie @pink_lady56 @AdamSchiffCA That’s called advice they advised him not to nominate anyone
@CathyKPearce @pink_lady56 @AdamSchiffCA Not the majority of states—but certainly the majority of illegals!
@ShesgotRegs @CathyKPearce @pink_lady56 @AdamSchiffCA Quoting Barney Fife, you’re “a nut!”
@jssjanetss @ShesgotRegs @CathyKPearce @pink_lady56 @AdamSchiffCA So please push for the Dems to nominate her it will make my day—year—decade—century—maybe even life!
@jssjanetss @ShesgotRegs @CathyKPearce @pink_lady56 @AdamSchiffCA She’d lose in an even bigger landslide
@JodyD53797808 @realrinohunter @pink_lady56 @AdamSchiffCA Denigrating, redefining, and destroying marriage and family is extreme.  As is a government-sponsored and condoned genocide of unborn children.
@cgags @skinapig @realrinohunter @pink_lady56 @AdamSchiffCA @POTUS None of the things you mentioned are illegal and at least one is an ignorant lie.
@cgags @skinapig @realrinohunter @pink_lady56 @AdamSchiffCA @POTUS But Kim Davis was
@cgags @realrinohunter @pink_lady56 @AdamSchiffCA And he will respect Roe and its partial overruling in Casey.  He will allot them due weight under the law of precedent and stare decisis.  But as he should, I believe that he will find them necessary of overruling.
@cgags @realrinohunter @pink_lady56 @AdamSchiffCA All presidents nominate Supreme Court justices if a vacancy arises and yes—shocking as it may be—even ones you disagree with.!
@JodyD53797808 @pink_lady56 @2foodie @AdamSchiffCA That was just talk unlike the still-denying-and-refusing-to-apologize-Bill-Clinton.  The governor of Arkansas and oh yeah president and wife of Crooked Hillary who had the Arkansas state police bring women to the governors mansion for him to have sex with!
@BeeMcG8 @pink_lady56 @AdamSchiffCA That would be your (unheard-of) precedent not Senator McConnell’s.  And McConnell’s presidential election year precedent is actually the handiwork of Joseph Biden.
@AdamSchiffCA It would just delay the correct number of justices on the court and lead to a bunch of 4-4 deadlocks
@AdamSchiffCA In a presidential election year.  Trump will still be picking if he waits until 2019
@LazyCircles @RepSwalwell It’s not like the Democrats gerrymandered Maryland...7 Dems to 1 Republican and the governor’s stated goal of the redistributing was to “elect more Democrats”.  You folks make hypocritical statements that consider mildly erroneous and incomplete facts.

@ILuvBettyWhite @prettygrlkk1 @Wis83161 @jeffschuman @GovMikeHuckabee No unlike Democrats I’d like to keep drug abuse at a minimum.  President Trump and VP Pence recognize the sanctity of life and are working both judicially and legislatively to restrict and eventually abolish abortion.
@ILuvBettyWhite @prettygrlkk1 @Wis83161 @jeffschuman @GovMikeHuckabee Not true he’s standing up for our Christian values
@GovMikeHuckabee Don’t invite Maxine over...she’s already been around him too much!
@GovMikeHuckabee I’d be scared too
@Chaos2Cured @SenateMajLdr I do appreciate that.  That’s what’s missing from Washington DC today.
@Chaos2Cured @SenateMajLdr Although Trump’s personal life is anything but pure or Biblical, he vowed to stop abortion and his party opposes gay marriage and he will as he’s doing now keep &amp; expand our conservative Supreme Court is which will defend these values and core principles.  That is why.
@Chaos2Cured @SenateMajLdr The same to you.  Very good and intelligent person.
@Chaos2Cured @SenateMajLdr Which this country was found is in my view a disgrace
@Chaos2Cured @SenateMajLdr That is not in the Constitution.  The First Amendment says “Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof.”  Reversing the traditional family as understood for thousands of years and trying to eliminate the God upon
@Chaos2Cured @SenateMajLdr Exactly...which is why the ruling is an encroachment on states rights according to the Tenth Amendment.  Genocide of unborn children is not a constitutional right but a moral and legal wrong.
@PerkinsShari @ipock_paula @TheiDoof10 @alaskaelearning @GovMikeHuckabee It is a crying shame.  Extremist leftists backed up by media bias and propaganda call for violence and harassment of women.  It is a distraction technique to skew the perception of the accomplishments of “45” and it’s distasteful, outrageous, and Un-American!  #GodSaveOurCountry

@JosepiRodrigo @SarahPalinUSA Either way, refusing Sarah was in poor taste...and following her family and her to scream and harass us wrong and horrible!  The lady needed the Secret Service!  That’s a pathetic outrage!
@JosepiRodrigo @SarahPalinUSA I’m uncertain of the legal standing of the owner in refusing Sarah on these grounds...a statutory interpretation of the Virginia statute may suggest its illegality.  However religious liberty is a core principle and homosexuality we may refuse to abet.

Slander and libel and corruption.  Disgraceful, wrong, and immoral!  Let Trump do his job &amp; get over your loss! https://t.co/zjPCE4l3fS
The Democratic witch hunt for collusion has gone too far.  This nonsense and lies has gone too far!  The colluding parties are Mueller and Clinton supporters/donors who have operated this investigation and blamed Republicans for obstructing both the corrupt and unconstitutional https://t.co/zjPCE4l3fS

I urge you all to read this and stop believing or stooping to the level or having any faith or confidence in or allowing these extreme liberal Democratic propagandists who have used tactics much worse than the Russians to deceitfully sway the opinions of honest citizens! https://t.co/UgpTQNPpKq
Couldn’t have been said better or blunter! https://t.co/8CEN84HJYf
Iran has to be stopped.  Benjamin Netanyahu has evidence they’re still manufacturing nuclear weapons.  Trump clears up one crisis and he finds another of Obama’s “gifts” to straighten out!  #ProtectOurAllies #Trump2020 https://t.co/18ckLO9ymA
@GovMikeHuckabee @IsraeliPM We need to protect Israel there.  No matter what they shall not fall to these Arabs in accordance with the biblical prophecy.
@SenKamalaHarris You’re not owed anything!  It’s the president’s and his decision and they’re darn well gonna make it.  Herman Cain: “You’re not the president.”
This man is absolutely correct!  The “corruption of justice” award goes to the FBI and to the CIA!!! https://t.co/pFWwvVCfxs

@GovMikeHuckabee Absolutely!  “Crooked Hillary” lives up to her name!
This is what the Democrats have gone to.  The administration has done so much good, they’ve now resorted to more lies and falsehoods about administrative officials #GetALife https://t.co/HAUwqV4KWh
I don’t agree with Bernie Sanders on much, but this is outrageous.  How can my Meme pay more in taxes than Jeff Bezos?  I don’t want to raise their taxes but gees, they ought to have to pay what they owe!!!!!!!! https://t.co/M9pb2s3ZCZ
@TrumpPence45 Wouldn’t surprise me at all.  We can’t trust those people.
The liberal press can make all the propaganda they want, but now that more people are accepting Trump’s amazing accomplishments, they’re at a loss #MakeAmericaGreatAgain https://t.co/BAry8Ngixi
Yes Senator, eliminating penalties for those guilty of using or trafficking illegal drugs is a crucial step in a functional and reformed criminal justice system #moron https://t.co/FTtO0sBaf7
@RepSwalwell Driftnets are extremely important to the fishing industry, and thus the economy, however.
This is what’s wrong with our country.  Obama’s bowed down to the Arab King of Saudi Arabia but did nothing to prevent Israel from potential nuclear annihilation.  Pres. Trump is thankfully in office now and will wholeheartedly support our Israeli allies! https://t.co/1tiTmaxCmb
@RepSwalwell If you and your Democratic colleagues and become less radical then maybe the congress would get somewhere.  This political fit you all are throwing is having disastrous effects on our great nation!
@STPFreak @RepSwalwell @GOP The GOP wants to protect our children and our people.  We are trying to protect these innocent, sweet children from the unconstitutional sexual indoctrination they are receiving in many public schools and trying to end the ritualistic murder of unborn babies.  Let’s try that!
@RepSwalwell Thank you for your heroics!  You saved the lives of so many near and dear to us all!
@realDonaldTrump That’s great!
RT @realDonaldTrump: Just got recent Poll - much higher than President O at same time....Well, much more has been accomplished!

@RepSwalwell This is great news.  Another great accomplishment of the Donald J. Trump presidential administration!
Can’t these people just move on.  There was not this much investigation and propaganda to turn citizens against one another when Obama bowed down and kissed that Saudi king! https://t.co/9bI0JVki35

@SenKamalaHarris At least he wants to protect the coal industry and so many other industries that are important to Appalachia.
@RepSwalwell @realDonaldTrump @Paralympics @SpeakerRyan I’ll tell you what’s not going on Mr. Representative.  Our congressman are failing to set a good example for the younger generation.
@WorldAndScience No.  And dinosaurs are not real.
@HillaryClinton @RegionalPlan Stay out of politics!  #Loser #YouDidn’tWin #NobodyCares
@realDonaldTrump That’s right.  They’re on a dead end road with a sign reading: “Democratic congressman unseated November 2018”
@GovMikeHuckabee Sad.
@GovMikeHuckabee Jim Comey is a two-faced liar.
@realDonaldTrump The administration has made spectacular progress of late, pertaining to the denuclearization of North Korea.  Just another great achievement for this administration!
@realDonaldTrump Those of us who stand for the good of the country know that it is a dirty political ploy Mr. President.  The country nor Montana will stand for it.  #we’ll remember come November
@GovMikeHuckabee @realDonaldTrump @TBN In truth though, they’re the bigots.  They’ll see one day the Lord’s view on the whole matter though.
@GovMikeHuckabee @realDonaldTrump @TBN Yes that’s exactly what they want to do.  Every time good upstanding Christian conservatives make an effort to preserve the morals and safety of this country they use libel and slander to label us as bigots, racists, haters, homophobes, xenophobes and everything else.
