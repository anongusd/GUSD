@crowder @conservmillen It's the mentality. If you can kill a new born baby, why not 100 year old women? Why not 10 years olds? Eventually this will become the argument to get out of jail time if this keeps going. It's a slippery slope.

@American_Kopite @conservmillen @ReaganBattalion Unfortunately in the world we live in, yes, I do. That's why so many women are standing up and cheering for this to be an option. It wouldn't be an issue if no one wanted it.
@American_Kopite @conservmillen @ReaganBattalion It says more than that and you addressed the mental health aspect which is what brought this discussion on. You're shifting now and without focus there can't be a constructive discussion.
@American_Kopite @conservmillen @ReaganBattalion I think most people can comprehend. Late term abortions don't make sense. In a lot of cases you have to go into labor and partially deliver the baby so why not just have the baby and put it up for adoption? Also there are many that just use it as there own form of birth control.
@crowder @American_Kopite @conservmillen @ReaganBattalion You are too be missing a lot. I suggest going back and rereading the thread and maybe things will become more clear. That's a genuine suggestion. Not sarcasm.
@American_Kopite @conservmillen @ReaganBattalion Facts are facts.  Abortion of any kind is murder so pointing this out is only a piece to show how unstable people have become in their thinking.

@conservmillen 29¬†They have become filled with every kind of wickedness, evil, greed and depravity. They are full of envy, murder, strife, deceit and malice. They are gossips,¬†30¬†slanderers, God-haters, insolent, arrogant and boastful; they invent ways of doing evil; they disobey their parents;
@conservmillen Men committed shameful acts with other men, and received in themselves the due penalty for their error.		28¬†Furthermore, just as they did not think it worthwhile to retain the knowledge of God, so God gave them over¬†to a depraved mind, so that they do what ought not to be done.
@conservmillen 26¬†Because of this, God gave them over¬†to shameful lusts.¬†Even their women exchanged natural sexual relations for unnatural ones.27¬†In the same way the men also abandoned natural relations with women and were inflamed with lust for one another.
@conservmillen 24Therefore God gave them over¬†in the sinful desires of their hearts to sexual impurity for the degrading of their bodies with one another.25They exchanged the truth about God for a lie,¬†and worshiped and served created things¬†rather than the Creator‚Äîwho is forever praised.¬†Amen
@conservmillen thanks to him, but their thinking became futile and their foolish hearts were darkened.¬†22¬†Although they claimed to be wise, they became fools23¬†and exchanged the glory of the immortal God for images¬†made to look like a mortal human being and birds and animals and reptiles.
