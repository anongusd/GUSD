I have a friend who was born 4 days before I was and we've been close our whole lives. We did a joint birthday celebration tonight. Being back in my hometown has its moments.

@jenciTN My sister is obsessed with those.
I didn't know that I wanted a double-wall glass coffee mug until I got one for my birthday. ☕ ☕ ☕ https://t.co/mKYHqka295
@RedStateBlonde That's the kind of attitude that keeps this Republic great. Good girl.
There were 3 teachers at my birthday party who are hardcore conservatives. There's hope yet for the youth of America. Also, right to work states rule.
@RedStateBlonde The patriarchal chauvinist in me promises to provide clarity. And probably 🥃.
Also, Mexican food. #ForAmerica
Since my birthday fell on a Friday this year I'm making this a birthday weekend. I got presents to enhance my coffee and whiskey drinking so here we go.
@kamando Dziękuję!
@RedStateBlonde Thanks, doll. Wait, what if I tell you that you should care about something?
Thank you to everyone who reached out across the Twitterverse with birthday wishes yesterday. The tasteful nudes were greatly appreciated. #KruiserFeelings

#Kruisersis sent me some post-workout heated massage stuff for my b-day. It arrived just as I finished a 21 mile bike ride. PERFECT TIMING.

I like to take a "work hard, then play so hard you drop" approach to my birthday, so I hope I get some rest tonight.
I just cursed at my sore knee and then it popped and I think we're good now.
You really should read Part II just to marvel at my coining of the phrase "diarrhea waterfall': https://t.co/qJj9Ka3bz1
There was a lot more I could have added to both of those, but they were personal blog posts, not my memoirs. Those will be published in about 50 years.
And here is Part II: https://t.co/qJj9Ka3bz1
It's personal, too long (a two parter), and probably boring for most but I did publicly say I'd write about it. Here's Part I: https://t.co/DVutCyyd2V
Last week I tweeted this and I needed more time to think so it just got finished. https://t.co/578TiNcJJq
@wstafrican Yeah, it's ground you from the Internet time again, young lady.
@MadameAmerica @RMW_86 @SMW_Myron Well happy early birthday to me.
@RMW_86 @MadameAmerica @SMW_Myron Wait, I can have more than one of you?
@RMW_86 @MadameAmerica @SMW_Myron #NeighborWife It could be a thing.
@RMW_86 @MadameAmerica @SMW_Myron You would have to cook things for me if you did that. Maybe some sandwich making.
I'm writing something honest and personal and it's annoying but last week I promised some of you that I would.
So she broke the law to get here then assaulted somebody. I guess there are some illegal people. https://t.co/NVLEUbDDCU
In just the last few years Feb. has become a steaming pile of shit memories I'd rather not think about. I'm glad March starts w/ my birthday, which I've always treated as a national holiday.

I'm not big on revenge b/c that still involves dealing w/ people but there are a few who I wouldn't mind making rue some things they've recently done. The world needs more ruing.
Never fancied myself a stoic but I may interpret a lot of Seneca's writings as exhortations from the past for me to step to the dark side and finally write that manifesto.
I'm not sure what possessed me to begin reading Seneca but I'm glad I did. #yayrandom
I just sent two tweets that vanished into the ether. Twitter is acting up again. Last time it did this the tweets appeared a day later.
"Halt before every good which Chance brings to you, in a spirit of doubt and fear; for it is the dumb animals and fish that are deceived by tempting hopes."~Seneca

Decided to write this dual-meaning note to myself and stick it on my desk this morning. It was an excellent idea. https://t.co/qDJ1Pfvkw3
But I'm constantly called "anti-science" by people who live in a biological fantasy land b/c I am skeptical of climate computer models that have been proven wrong for forty years.
The liberal positions on gender fluidity, transgender athletes, and abortion make perfect sense if you've never been within a mile of a HS biology class.

And woe be unto anyone who gets in the way of that fun.
I've been dark and brooding for a few years. I act as if I have a professional obligation to be miserable. Time to have fun again.
I could lighten up a little too. I'm mellow about politics but still wound a little tight about other things.
The world could use a lot more whimsy. And beer.
Horrible night or whore-able night?
My birthday is on Friday. You're all invited. Well, all but one of you. You know who you are.
Came upon some correspondence from 10 yrs ago in an email account I never use anymore. Quite the trip down memory lane. Some of it may make it into something I'm writing now.
@DoodlesTrks This neighborhood is almost all old adobe homes. Most are kept in pretty good shape.
The Van Gogh twins are still painting so I'm playing music loudly now.
@OConnell75thRR They're lucky they're painting the neighbors' houses. If they were across the street &amp; painting mine I'd stand in the doorway in just my underwear until they stopped.
Wait, there are two of them out there. I'm moving to the middle of the desert by myself.
It would probably be a bit much if I strapped on a gun just to get my mail and be seen by Neighbor Van Gogh.
Some rando set up an easel in front of my house and is doing an oil painting of one of the neighbor's  houses. I don't know whether to celebrate the artiness of it or be creeped out.

The coaches finally decide to have #KruiserKid anchor the DMR and the team sets new school records 2 weeks in a row. Just sayin'.
I should write children's books. Give the genre that #SFK special treatment.
I've eaten Pei Wei 3 times in the last 8 nights because FULL YOLO.
What the fuck is up with bouillabaisse?
I have to be up early and I'm not sure sleep is happening.
Did I win a Spirit Award?
I feel like someone wailed on me with a baseball bat. For the record, that did not happen.

Oddly, I'm writing about that too in this post I'm working on.

@patrickalbanese It wasn't about fleeing CA for me. I just wanted to shake up my entire life. That involved so much more than a change in geography.
Now that it's Friday &amp; no one is paying attn I should probably get to those reflections on my move from Los Angeles. Probably do a few here, and I'm working on a blog post.
I honestly don't know whether my friends think I am arrogant or not.
#TrueStory 	Me when I woke up today: "I'm going to try to be nicer."	Me, 3 hrs later: "You're all too stupid for me to talk to." 	I don't seem to be trying hard enough.
I used to think I talked to myself because I'm crazy. Now I know it's because that's my best shot at getting an intelligent response.
This is why I rarely pose things as questions on Twitter anymore. The replies are largely idiotic.
@kodiaknkatysmom That borders on nonsensical.
@UntraceableMC @jamiekwil Which seems pretty fucking inconvenient to me.
@UntraceableMC @jamiekwil And get arrested.
@VictorConservat He was caught in a sting that rounded up 200 people. Pretty sure that wasn't law enforcement's motivation here.

@blubuttafly16 Yes, he used the media because he knew they'd bite on the story in a hurry. They are a predictable hive mind for the most part at this point, esp if one can throw in a Trump angle. It was like throwing a steak to a lion.
@blubuttafly16 And you should know that I am a daily consumer of a wide variety of media. Hence the skepticism. It's not as if I'm hiding from it all.
My beard is currently at a "call an FBI profiler" level of unkemptness.
Grocery store or @DoorDash? I think we know where this day is going. #KruiserFeelings
@blubuttafly16 We begin by being highly skeptical of the media. :) It's worked well for me.
@blubuttafly16 My original point was merely a semantic one. "Let down" seemed a bit tame. Your choice of words are all more expressive.
@blubuttafly16 Honest question: what then is wrong with getting really angry w/ him and the brain-dead media types who were complicit in perpetuating this hoax?
@HumorInstitute Windy as hell here in the desert too today. I hate the seasons.
@blubuttafly16 I admitted I was wrong. Take the win.
Probably going to shave today. Settle down people, that doesn't mean I'll be going out in public. It just means my faces itches.
People in Los Angeles can't drive if half an inch of rain falls in a week. The entire city may perish if it's snowing.
@blubuttafly16 Or because I've been a conservative in a liberal industry for decades and I know how the "tolerance" is meted out. But you're right, I shouldn't apply blanket assumptions.
I blame the anti-vaxxers. https://t.co/N1J6frPCDp
@blubuttafly16 Just wondering if the response would be so benevolently tempered if Smollett were on the other side of the political aisle. Pretty sure I know the answer.

I will now be returning to my books, writing, and not giving a fuck about the news. Enjoy the rest of your Hump Day, America.

@kstephens415 So you've never watched a basketball game. Also, knit caps on an adult are really fucking embarrassing, Sparky.
If you thought I hated the mainstream media before, wait until you see what a couple of weeks of false narrative smears against the #CovingtonCatholic boys have done to this Catholic school boy.
Don't ever let people goad you into a response that will give them even a modicum of satisfaction for having done so. #KruiserFeelings

@wjstankewick It is good to have a Twitter conversation about differing (albeit slightly) viewpoints, though. A rarity these days.
@wjstankewick I'm also pretty sure that the "if you didn't get paid" tales of woe of a lifelong self-employed person will make this media manufactured workers' existential crisis look pretty trivial.
@wjstankewick I've also been writing about gov't bloat and my displeasure with Congress over it for decades, so don't presume to lecture me.
@wjstankewick I said the media annoyed me and directed no anger whatsoever at the furloughed workers. I merely said there are inherent, known risks to any career and this is one of the few they face.

I'm in a philosophical, self-discovery conundrum and I can't really say it's bothering me as much as it should. I just plain don't give a fuck.
Back to last night's topic...my complete lack of desire to be good just because that's what I should do is obviously in direct conflict w/ my faith.
I'm not here to be good anymore, I'm here to be me.
It's dark, cold and egocentric inside here right now. And I like it.
Does the effort it takes to be decent add value to my life? (What's the point?) I can't say that it does right now.
This is good manifesto stuff.
I'm going to need a little fucking quid pro quo action from people I'm decent to. That's been lacking lately.
I don't believe that's true anymore.
I can be mean. I can be vengeful. I can turn on people in a heartbeat. For years I've chosen not to because I thought avoiding all that made me a better man.
@itsonlywords It's not a suicidal "What's the point?" I'm SO not that kind of guy. I fucking love me and want to live until at least 120.

We wouldn't be worrying about Kyrsten Sinema if Jeff Flake had remained conservative when he got to the Senate rather than becoming McCain's Mini Me.
I'm pretty much dead inside when it comes to anything not involving my kid so it's not a big leap for me.
