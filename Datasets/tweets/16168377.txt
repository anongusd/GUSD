@BriannaWu Well as you may know not only are bump stocks illegal to sell/buy in MA but also to possess if aquired before the ban. Try reading our state laws. Enlightening. AR 15's have many positive attributes and imo should not have been banned in MA. Any firearm could be used to "assault"
@BriannaWu who in tarnation are you quoting?! You need to take an NRA safety course. It's very enlightening I guarantee you will love it.

The irresponsibility lies with law enforcement. The majority of lic. firearm owners practice commonsense safety measures learned thru NRA courses.
@raeberries77 @sabine_durden @Acosta It's a travesty how the democrats twist the facts and claim that the border security is anti-immigration and racism. Lawlessness is the issue.Without law enforcement we end up with chaos.Hence our struggle with humane processing of hoards of migrants rushing the border America1st
It's not sad. It's infuriating. When a bad guy gets caught it's a reason to celebrate considering the mission of the left is to promote lawlessness. This is a spiritual battle for which you report on the wrong side. https://t.co/PmSC5HHEEt

@one_skeptical @AApologetics I consider it faith not a religion. One can be religious about anything. For example, daily schedule. I wish you well. Smile. God loves you ü•∞
@one_skeptical @AApologetics Not true. One isn‚Äôt a Christian for simply reading the Bible and attending church. Acceptance of Jesus‚Äô sacrifice aka conversion/ born again is the point at which one becomes a Christian. A personal one on one experience. My suggestion: Read the gospel of John/ C A Lewis
@one_skeptical @AApologetics Well it couldn‚Äôt hurt to research what all the hub bub is about by finding out what the ‚Äùsalvation plan‚Äù is could it? Inquiring minds want to know. Unless you're just a troll. HS comes in handy to identify those.
@bbusa617 I believe that‚Äôs called pedophilia.
@one_skeptical @AApologetics I should point out that I am not a biblical scholar or an apologist. Just someone willing to share my experience.
@one_skeptical @AApologetics If you sincerely ask God that question after you understand His plan of salvation, I guarantee it. The mystery that I believe is that Jesus is fully God and fully human. The third person the HS lives within me as a helper in this fallen world.
@one_skeptical @AApologetics Well I define ‚Äùbeliever‚Äù as someone who accepts that Jesus was sacrificed in my place for my sins. At age 3 I believed that Jesus loved me but did not know Jesus personally til I was an adult. You‚Äôd be surprised at how many church goers are not believers!
@one_skeptical @AApologetics Again it's not tangible but I can tell you that after my conversion at age 31 (church goer whole life) I was able to dissect and realize the timeline of how he had reached me. Therefore I don't underestimate the power of God. At conversion I invited the HS to live in me.
‚ÄúBut now faith, hope, love, abide these three; but the greatest of these is love.‚Äù	1 Corinthians 13:13 NASB https://t.co/JefXBQjUqg
@one_skeptical @AApologetics I agree. The evidence is not tangible. You must know that you know by His Holy Spirit. It's a personal experience where you answer His call however He chooses to reach you.
