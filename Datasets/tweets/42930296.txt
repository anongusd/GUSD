Active taxiway = no food or beverages. So we‚Äôre looking at two hours (after an hourlong flight without beverage service). I‚Äôm thirsty just thinking about next ‚Äú40 minutes or so.‚Äù
Oh good! We can stand up! To use the NOT broken bathroom! But we don‚Äôt have to, because there‚Äôs no food or drink to be consumed. @AmericanAir
But @AmericanAir is every gate you control at DCA actually being used? Is there really no more creative a solution than to let passengers sit buckled in, waiting?
‚ÄúAnother 30 minutes,‚Äù because DCA has inadequate equipment for weather situations. Do better, DC.
Nearly an hour on the runway at DCA, no sign of moving. Thanks for getting us this far @AmericanAir, shame on DCA for not being able to manage any weather activity.
Hey @Avis you‚Äôve got a man named Kevin working the returns area at CLT who is an absolute star and should be rewarded for his kindness and patience and top notch service / humanity. Thanks for spending 30 min with me finding my phone! In the trash!

This is using my "preferred number." My other number is at 16:58. Unusually high call volume? Before 5a ET on a day with no weather in East?
Do I show up for a flight around 6a or 10a  @SouthwestAir? Pretty big difference &amp; have an afternoon flight on @AmericanAir - a real company
Apparently in @SouthwestAir terms "soon" means "we'll have a robot talk to you and make you give up all hope because we don't want your $"

First win for @united - flight attendant is wonderful
I'm tired, too. But I try to be pleasant. I smiled and patiently asked why flight was delayed. Treated as if I was asking an unreasonable q!
And the ORD @united woman at counter F3 is curt, too. Didn't realize it was an offense to ask why flight is delayed. 0 for 2.
@united boarded and did land on time. Wasn't a pleasant experience in any way. But, halfway there. Thanks!
Should have chosen tomorrow's @AmericanAir flight. Would have gotten home at same time without @united attitude and inefficacy
Flight not even halfway boarded and meanest @united woman leaves. Guess shift is up? You can go but I'm still stuck waiting for seat.
At least when @AmericanAir staff is stressed they're nice to you. At @united at Sea-Tac they are mean/treat you like an inconvenience
Unimpressed by @united. I've been yelled at for asking seat assignment for 2+ hours. Show up early: get yelled at. Ask at boarding: mean

@AmazonHelp I was told the ONLY option was to re-order, and return the package when I received it. Pkg being delivered to OH, I live in DC
We don't have product so we can't get it to you by the promised 12/16. If you don't have the product, why can't you cxl order? Uhhh @amazon
At what minute should a company just give up &amp; admit the customer is right, refund $20 dispute. (At what minute do I give up? ATTRITION!)

RT @SabrinaSiddiqui: "What will I miss? Well of course, all of you," Boehner tells reporters.
What made boehner decide to announce today? "Just all this stuff I read about in the paper, it's I really don't want the institution hurt."

Boehner I would not describe it as having had enough. That's not it at all... Having a vote like this "not very helpful to the institution."

Does @SpeakerBoehner feels he was pushed out? "No... I feel good about what I've done... Everyday tried to do the right thing."

Did grace of #PopeFrancis lead him to this decision? No, says @SpeakerBoehner, but he did say some very kind words

so I guess I was a stickler for what counted as applause - if it wasn't from the floor or from more than a small handful, I didn't count it
Watching Cory Remsburg leave chamber you're impressed by his strength &amp; courage, but also that of his dad. Another applause as he exits.

RT @mikememoli: .@edatpost thinks that POTUS thumbs up to the gallery was for Duck Dynasty guy
Lot of Senators wait to shake POTUS hand before leaving chamber, including smiling Rubio. Meanwhile staffers start removing signs from seats
Winding up last paragraph, my applause count from start of speech is 77. Now make sure you're tuned to @CBSNews for analysis &amp; more
Even Supreme Court justices join this huge applause for wounded warrior Cory Remsburg (they refrain from any claps, etc. always)
Thumbs up from Mrs. Obama and Cory Remsburg, big standing ovation from crowd
Some members try to get a "USA" Chant going at mention of Olympics. #NeededMoreHeart
Alright guys stay with it, we are almost on the last page... More yawns, fewer notes being taken at 57 minutes into SOTU
So it's not just cold in the press gallery box. Rep. Jackson Lee wraps a gold pashmina over her pink suit.
Not standing on this line about Afghanistan/"terrorists do not launch attacks...:" Sen. McCain. Looks dubious.
Judiciary committee chairman Goodlatte quick to applaud, stand for "citizenship means standing up for everyone's right to vote"
Laughter from many, quiet fake clap from @RepPaulRyan when POTUS says he doesn't expect to convince r colleagues of merits of #obamacare
And the crowd goes wild - that line you couldn't hear was "because I firmly believe when women succeed, America succeeds"
Bipartisan ovation for equal pay for equal work for women
Quite a few House R's stand for immigration reform line. Will be interesting to see how high enthusiasm for it is at GOP retreat this week
And we are at 2 dozen applause lines in approximately 14 minutes
Cole, King (NY), Rogers, some of few Rs who applaud at "when our differences shut down govt... Threaten full faith &amp; credit" Not going right
Four minutes in and second standing applause from both sides for "China is no longer...# 1 place to invest; America is"
Brightest outfit award for tonight goes to @rosadelauro
Biden, Reid, et al enter the chamber. Lots of red jackets and dresses on women sitting in aisle seats. (Not a coincidence)

Marino says regardless of how minimal intervention in #Syria is "an American military personnel will die," which is why he can't vote for it
Rep. Marino is fired up over the "endgame" and wondering "who are the good guys?" in #Syria
Deutch: If we want to do everything in our power to stop Iranian nuclear weapon capability, we must support this [#syria] resolution
Kerry: there are moments where you have to make a decision, and I think this is one of those moments. #Syria
Kerry says there are more countries that have offered to be part of #Syria operation than military currently believes we need
Hagel: The other side of the Capitol held us up, but we are much better for it... #Syria
Kerry responds to earlier protest: I think the three of us understand that plea [don't go to war] as well as anyone in this country #Syria

Menendez: "aspiration" to get to language everyone can agree on for #Syria authorization &amp; if so "look forward to poss of a markup tomorrow"
Kerry very strong in answer to Udall question, says history is full of moments where people didn't stand up when it made a difference
Kerry: [Assad] will weather it [a potential strike]... The Preisdent... is not asking for permission to destroy the entire regime...
Rubio: This [#Syria] is a reminder of what happens when we ignore the world... we are left with options, all of which are less than ideal
And we have our third protester in #Syria hearing... unclear if he was with a group, but asked "where is the moral high ground here?"
Cardin on #Syria: It's clear taht we have to respond, and a military response is justified... [but need focus that mission]
Kerry: I think it's important for us to not get into an unnecessary -- some struggle over some of this with Russia for a lot of reasons...
Boxer: I will support the targeted effort -- but not a blank check -- to respond to Syria's unspeakable deeds
Kerry: There will not be American boots on the ground with respect to the civil war [in #Syria]
Kerry: If we fail to act, we're going to have fewer allies #syria
Hagel: Refusal to act would undermine the credibility of America's other security commitments... the word of America must mean something
As Hagel starts, you can still hear Code Pink protester hollering outside Hearing room doors #Syria
Code Pink protester shouts to Kerry, "The American people do not want this," she's escorted out of #Syria hearing, yelling
Kerry: This is not a time for armchair isolationism... neither our countries or our conscience can afford the cost of silence #Syria
Kerry: If the US steps back from this moment... what is the message [to Assad?] The message is that he has been granted impunity... #Syria
Kerry: I can tell you that we know these things beyond a reasonable doubt #Syria
Noting Iraq vote, Kerry says he &amp; Hagel "especially sensitive" to guaranteeing intel is accurate. Lists "physical evidence," commonsense
Corker: I know were going to talk about chem warfare, but I hope you'll give us more clarity about opposition strengthening, strategy #Syria
Corker: My guess is most everyone here fully believes that chem weapons have been used on civilians to a large degree #Syria
During Menendez opening statement, Teresa Heinz Kerry entered the hearing. Sec. Kerry kissed her cheek.
Menendez: If chem weapons can be used with impunity... in #Syria... they can be used without fear of reprisal anywhere, by anyone...
Menendez: Are we so tired of war that we are willing to silence our conscience &amp; accept the consequences [of that silence]? #syria

Love this @bobschieffer question about what if Netanyahu called saying bombers on way to attack. Romney doesn't bite.
POTUS calls Gov. Romney's criticisms of his admin's Iran policies the "biggest whopper" of #Campaign2012
Romney sticking with "capability" phrasing. Says sanctions need to be tightened, diplomatic isolation, "indict" Ahmadinejad.
Deal with Iran POTUS will accept? That they "end their nuclear program."
POTUS says NYT reports about one-on-one talks Iran agreed to "are reports in a newspaper. They are not true."
Would Romney declare attack on Iran an attack on US? Romney underscores "same point Pres. made... when I'm pres., we will stand w/ Israel"
POTUS "I will stand with Israel if they are attacked."
