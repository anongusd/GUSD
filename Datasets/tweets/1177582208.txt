@lapezlady @CNNPolitics Still shaking my head over what I listened to coming from his mouth today.
@TR_Ahlstrom We need a lot more than one, a Tony. It's time for Republicans to step up on behalf of the country. Very dangerous man!
@BrianKarem If he actually meant that, this would have been the first time EVUH that he got facts first, if at all.
@MoreBlueStates @Nazi_Catcher @kathygriffin Yeah. The car probably wouldn't have hit Heather then, right?
@GeorgeTakei Soon and bigly.
@BrianKarem As usual, a day late and a dollar short. Should have said this from the beginning rather than wait to see how much backlash he would get.
@donnabrazile I just wanted to make it clear that my response was not to Donna Brazile. it was to one of the responses to her post.
@donnabrazile Shut up.
@hardball @morningmoneyben Grotesque!
@JoyAnnReid @thedailybeast CNN, I hope you're reading all of these responses. Stop using liars and losers on your panels! It's embarrassing.
RT @lauferlaw: Likened to drinking a gallon of prune juice to dislodge the Trump from the large intestines. https://t.co/NGpUdsoq8t
RT @perlmutations: I personally endorse our president going to war with North Korea. Not our military of course, just the president.
@StephenKing And it's a toss-up.
@tedlieu Oh really? I think we've already lost that position on the list. Because of Trump,!we are ridiculed around the world.

@DeaExLena I'm Aeelnor.
@realDonaldTrump @BarackObama For crying out loud, Trump. Give it up already. Obama was born in the USA. Stop pretending that you have "secret" info to prove otherwise.
@WhiteHouse I'll get right on that. üòÅ
@ChelseaClinton Completely uncalled for and mean, Shay. Chelsea is a beautiful woman, inside and out.
@FoxNews @SarahHuckabee Hope you're proud of your daughter, Mike Huckabee. She's a first-class liar. What an embarrassment.
@SethAbramson Seriously. "Here, son. Lie down so I don't have to work so hard to throw you under the bus."
@FoxNews @CLewandowski_ @POTUS He is clearly perfectly capable of destroying himself.
@WhiteHouse Jim is a friend of ours. I'm only sorry that it was THIS president who bestowed the honor.
@BillKristol Sorry. Autocorrect did that, Bill KRISTOL.
@BillKristol Bill Kristie, I think I'm even beginning to like you a little bit.
@BrianKarem Don't call him Mr. President. He doesn't deserve the honor.

@KeithOlbermann God, I hope you're right!
@realDonaldTrump All you worship is the almighty dollar, you worthless piece of trash.
@realDonaldTrump No, we do not. We are SO diverse. Many worship other deities. Many worship no one at all. Who do you bloody think you are?
RT @JoeBiden: Every patriotic American who is qualified to serve in our military should be able to serve. Full stop.
@realDonaldTrump Consultation my behind! Name one general or military expert who told you to do this despicable thing.
RT @DavidCornDC: Today would be a good day for @realDonaldTrump to release his tax returns.
@BrianKarem Please tell me this is a joke.
@BrianKarem Also a twit.

@CNN It is most definitely inappropriate!
@therealjanisian Love your haikus, Janis!
@realDonaldTrump @WashTimes He doesn't care.
@realDonaldTrump Really? You were giving our country away?!?
@RoguePOTUSStaff Yeah. He's definitely being forced to take a bullet for the "team."
@BrianKarem And also with you.
@therealjanisian How many more centuries before we can actually turn the corner on women's rights?
@TR_Ahlstrom By Trump's values, you mean? Frightening!
@tedlieu @lmich2010 @realDonaldTrump According to them, nobody discusses anything with Agent Orange.
@tedlieu @lmich2010 @realDonaldTrump Like that would stop him?
@therealjanisian I was born in upstate New York.
@IanDunt I thought Great Britain made it clear that they don't want him on their soil.
@TR_Ahlstrom We can only resist and hope.

@jpodhoretz @RobinTryloff Unfair and typical.

@realDonaldTrump Is this an actual admission that Russia did indeed meddle in our election?

@BarbraStreisand No doubt. That was my first thought--that he needed time to "doctor" them.
@ananavarro Not if they have a functioning brain. Nauseating.
@davidaxelrod You couldn't be more wrong. We liberals love your words tweets, because they repeatedly point out what a pouty child you are.
@realDonaldTrump Are you serious? Everybody in Europe hates you.
@RepAdamSchiff @irisbreeze That happened on Day One.
@RoguePOTUSStaff You've got THAT right!
@ChrisCuomo First, you have to FIND a scientist who does not firmly believe in climate change.
