@JasonScheer I think all five starters are good. The problem is with the bench. Lee, Akot and Smith have been awful.

The Cats need to get some offense from Lee and Akot. Neither one is contributing.
@JasonScheer And if our bench doesn‚Äôt contribute, we will be fatigued in the second half, which will kill our chances of winning.
@ThatSportsPaige @AZwildcats1997 I agree and it‚Äôs nice to watch a team that plays together and plays hard.

@NotJimLivengood That is certainly plausible, but I still think we played a better and more experienced team. Also, our lack of help from the bench kept our starters on the floor too much.

@brilemburg Should be fun. I will be there loud and proud..... after a couple hours of tailgating of course. #BearDown
@NotJimLivengood Rest assured that Mark Few made his necessary adjustments at halftime and Miller either saw it immediately or anticipated it. Bottom line is Gonzaga is a stronger team and we have no depth in the front court to withstand foul trouble.
@brilemburg We are about to see what we are made of.
@DeadBunnyFrank Santorum is not a political figure either and the reason for that is because he is a GOP hack who says whatever he thinks will help him stay on as a @CNN contributor.
@JasonScheer No way. They are going to surprise some teams and that might include Gonzaga tonight. #BearDown

@MattGOAZCATS Doutrive looks very athletic, but raw. @APlayersProgram is very deep at guard and the Brandon duo looks great. You also have Barcello and Smith, both of whom have a year under their belt.
@brilemburg Maybe because he has 5 minutes of experience, which is pretty much more than any other guard.
@ghansen711 It‚Äôs a bit early to draw that conclusion. It may be a tough sell ultimately, but Randolph has a chance.
@brilemburg He can‚Äôt even make a free throw.

@realDonaldTrump Here is some fake news - Trump apologized for calling the media the enemy of the people. Here is another fake news item - Trump is a decent human being. #ImpeachTrumpNow #BlueWaveComing
@KenidraRWoods_ Yes
@JonHeyman Roberts has achieved some success with the @Dodgers , but it is not one iffy game. He has over managed crucial games and has relied on players based on their history, rather than current performance. If he shows he learned from his mistakes, keep him. If not, time to move on.
@STPFreak No doubt they are great and still might have won that game and/or the series. Still, that move cost the Dodgers a great chance of evening up the series.
@letsgomathias @UROCKlive1 This is not only a testament to what it means to be American, but it is something that our leadership should be drawing attention to as a reminder of that truth.  Unfortunately, I am certain that @realDonaldTrump would never consider it.
@giantsfan516 @realDonaldTrump I guess he is a great human being and fine role model.  And all of the ‚Äúfake news‚Äù media are wrong and Fox News is the one news outlet that tells the unslanted truth. And so on and so on. Thanks for the conversation. Go Yanks.
@giantsfan516 @realDonaldTrump You are missing the point. Do you like the way @realDonaldTrump talks about the media, the dems and various minorities?  Do you think it helps unite us? If you don‚Äôt think it contributes to the hateful conduct we are seeing, then you are wrong.
@giantsfan516 @realDonaldTrump He didn‚Äôt hate Trump as much as he thought Trump was too soft on Jews.  Regardless, Trump‚Äôs words and conduct were at the center of this guy‚Äôs motivation.
@realDonaldTrump No one is blaming conservatives. It‚Äôs mostly you and Republican leadership who do little or nothing to curb your hateful, dishonest rhetoric. Your words incite and empower certain members of your base who have little or no self-restraint. Hence, you share responsibility for it.
@JonHeyman Roberts has many fine qualities as a manager, but there is no excuse for some of his decisions and last night was the worst yet.
The Dodgers loss last night falls squarely on Roberts. There was no reason to take Hill out of the game and certainly no good reason to put Jansen in the game. Roberts is always overmanaging and needs to  be fired.
@MKGenest @maddow @StephenAtHome @sethmeyers @Lawrence O‚ÄôDonnell is one of my favorites, but I love your choices also.

@smerconish If you are talking about judging his worthiness of being on SCOTUS, then no criminal convictions or criminal behavior of moral turpitude, full disclosure and transparency regarding his entire life. Any lie or deception is a disqualification. #KavanaughConfirmation
@StevePhillipsGM @Buster_ESPN Good point, but wouldn‚Äôt it be nice if you started against the Mets every time and never faced the Cubs, Brewers, Rockies, etc.?
@tonyschwartz Not that I am promoting kavanaugh‚Äôs confirmation, but polygraph test results are not evidence and you cannot and should not conclude someone is lying based solely on him/her providing a different answer. #DelayKavanaughVote
@brilemburg Eli is a liability for this team now. He can‚Äôt move.
@stonecold2050 Not a surprise if @realDonaldTrump fires Mueller. He knows that his son and/or son-in-law are about to face indictments and possibly a plea deal and he knows he will face indictment or impeachment.  Luckily, it will only hurt him if he does it. #ImpeachTrump

@taserthis1984 @USAttyBash I can‚Äôt answer that question for Zina Bash because I don‚Äôt know enough about her or what she read on her phone immediately preceding the gesture. Why would someone of Mexican and Jewish descent work for or with Stephen Miller?
@taserthis1984 @USAttyBash Probably not, but again, that display has other accepted meanings. Making it on your crossed arms is different, don‚Äôt you agree?
@taserthis1984 @USAttyBash Because the manner in which she made the sign warrants that assertion, unless someone can point to another accepted interpretation of it. I haven‚Äôt found one. It‚Äôs like someone giving you the middle finger. Are you being told to eff off or are you being called number one?
@taserthis1984 @USAttyBash Nowhere in any of my tweets on this subject did I allege that Zina Bash is or was a white supremacist.
@DaddyDaddymac I am pretty sure there is a contingency plan in the event that happens, whereby everything he has compiled thus far will be preserved and ultimately released.
@taserthis1984 @USAttyBash Correct. I wouldn‚Äôt want you as a juror bc you are the biased one. Based on the facts alone, it is more likely than not that she was making a white power sign. Is it beyond a reasonable doubt?  Maybe, maybe not. Is it an ‚ÄúI am ok‚Äù message?  Highly unlikely. Case closed.
@LouiseMensch @SMBWhitney @washingtonpost You automatically believe Mattis‚Äô denial over @realBobWoodward based on what?
@taserthis1984 @USAttyBash I understand all that, but it doesn‚Äôt answer the question as to why she deliver made that particular hand sign, which is more than likely a white power signal. And yes, I am really an attorney. Lol.
@taserthis1984 @USAttyBash She could have shot them a text and what kind of trouble could she be in, sitting there on national tv? And is that her ‚Äúl am ok‚Äù sign? I don‚Äôt think so. It may have been something she did as a bad joke, but it was a white power sign.

@smerconish @NFL No. It‚Äôs a great tradition and promotes unity and patriotism surrounding the sport that is part of the fabric of our country.  With that said, it doesn‚Äôt need to be shown on TV and kneeling during it is a lot more respectful than people in the stands eating, talking, etc.  #NFL

@laurack13 @MrDane1982 Actually, he said he was considering running. That is a long way from actually running. And how that translates to racism simply because he is white is absurd. That was my point.
@smerconish @realDonaldTrump @GOP @CNN @cnni I think we have seen that voters on both sides are deeply entrenched in their positions and virtually nothing Trump does or says, whether it‚Äôs televised , tweeted about or talked about, will change anyone‚Äôs vote #BlueWave.
@MichaelAvenatti @JRubinBlogger @Mediaite Worked on campaigns?  What does that mean?  Did you hand out flyers?  You have done some impactful things, but I think you need to work in DC first. How about AG?
@MrDane1982 @laurack13 That‚Äôs a helluva leap you‚Äôre making. Nobody said he was actually running and I seem to remember that Obama was African American.
@realDonaldTrump @MariaBartiromo I didn‚Äôt know @MariaBartiromo was part of Mueller‚Äôs team of investigators. If not, she is blowing hot air with no basis in fact.
@wordsmithviv No. We don‚Äôt need another cavalier inexperienced president, even if he has good intentions. He is making a positive impact in his current role. If he wants to be a politician, let him start smaller.
@realDonaldTrump I guess they could demonstrate across the street from the White House. Oh wait, that venue is taken with protesters against you. #protesttrump
@FoxNews @Judgenap Yes. Please somebody allow Trump to sit down with Mueller and make sure he knows it is perfectly ok to just be himself. #TrumpKnew
@FoxNews @benshapiro The dems may not have enough new ideas, but they have a slew of old ones, like affordable health care for all, equality in wages, gun control, freedom of the press, democracy and human decency.   #BlueWaveComing2018
RT @HowardA_Esq: I finally figured out why Trump is orange: he's a combination of cowardly yellow, and communist red.
@maddow One of the most telling parts of his statements was a comment he made concerning the impeachment of Rosenstein when he intimated that he wanted to ultimately proceed with it because he simply doesn‚Äôt like him. #ProtectRosenstein
@realDonaldTrump Here‚Äôs an idea-play a little less golf, stop meeting and talking to dictators surreptitiously, stop tweeting your self-serving lies multiple times a day and stop watching Fox News. That should free up several hours a day. #BlueWave2018
@redturn2 Astounding for the pitcher. Embarrassing for the other team.

@brilemburg Maybe it‚Äôs a good thing for the basketball team to fly under the radar to start the season.
@FoxNews Dueling claims?  That is an insult to Jerry Brown and all Californians.
@smerconish @realDonaldTrump POTUS going stupid.
@frontlinepbs @ProPublica @PBS Thanks
@amandalabell @MichaelAvenatti Do we really want someone with no political experience?  @MichaelAvenatti is doing and saying a lot of good things, but I think our country needs the stability of government experience, just not GOP experience.
@realDonaldTrump I was wondering what was taking you so long to attack Adam Schiff, a very bright, well-spoken critic of your criminal behavior. Of course, your attack is based on false information and does nothing more than project your own guilt on one more person. #TrumpKnew
@wordsmithviv @wildwillow65 Don‚Äôt judge too quickly. There is a strong chance they have no idea what their shirts say.
@AmandiOnAir @MalcolmNance @realDonaldTrump The next president will have a lot of work to do and we should have a Hazmat team cleanse the WH too.
@AshaRangappa_ Is there an option for ‚Äúall of the above?‚Äù
@MikeLevinCA @realDonaldTrump Don‚Äôt bother. He can‚Äôt read.
@mkraju Rand Paul‚Äôs only motivation seems to be getting his name and face on television. He is a joke with no backbone.
@brilemburg Pretty much.
@brianstelter He is intentionally attempting to incite violence. Dehumanizing, yes.  Immoral, yes. Criminal, yes. #IMPEACHTRUMPNOW
@kesha16161 I feel the same way. It especially hurts when friends and/or family fall into that group. I have become very selective in my discussions regarding Trump.
@kesha16161 Trump followers equate speaking the truth with speaking without a filter. Trump clearly speaks with no filter. #LyingTrump
@realDonaldTrump You are pathetic. If a journalist is hurt or God forbid, killed by any of your followers, the blood is on your hands. I know you won‚Äôt care, but our legal system will. #FakePresident
@EdKrassen No more than I want Trump in my country.
@JoeBiden @DogTagBakery @BarackObama It is incredibly refreshing to see two individuals from different backgrounds seeing the common traits, characteristics and moral objectives in each other and from that, building a genuine friendship. Thank you both and happy birthday President Obama.
@realDonaldTrump Is Lebron going to be there to welcome you? #RacistInChief
@TheSlew @brianstelter @Acosta Huh?  Wha does that have to do with Donald working hard?  Do you remember him making fun of Obama playing a lot of golf and stating that he wouldn‚Äôt have time to play?  You are ok with the lie? Trumpers were duped by Trump.
@WalshFreedom Or you can stay and try to fix it, but that would be too democratic for you and other Trumpers. #FakePresidentTrump
@FoxNews @mercedesschlapp Tweeting and playing golf don‚Äôt qualify as work. You must be a model employee yourself if that is your definition of work ethic. #FakePresident
@realDonaldTrump @nytimes I don‚Äôt really like fiction. I am waiting for Woodward‚Äôs book. I am sure you will have a lot to tweet about after someone reads it to you.
@tribelaw You are correct and it will continue to escalate. Each rally feeds his ego a little more and infuses him with more confidence and bravado for the next rally. Also, to see children in his audience is really disturbing. Its borderline child abuse to make them listen to his BS.
@brilemburg They are probably not good enough for you.
@sjredmond A year ago in January.
@brilemburg Take the shuttle. Big and comfy. It may cost 40 though.
@brianstelter @Acosta Of course, he is absolutely correct, but how do we stop this before a member of the news media gets seriously hurt or worse?  God forbid, that happens, blood will be on Trump‚Äôs hands. Sadly, he won‚Äôt care. #FakePresident
@Lane79Reg Trump didn‚Äôt earn the title, so why give it to him? #FakePresident
@StephenKing Fox will never do that.
@AriMelber He is not going to talk to Mueller without a subpoena and a SCOTUS ruling that he is subject to the subpoena power and even then, I am not so sure. #FakePresident
@FoxNews @PressSec In other words, he hasn‚Äôt done anything to protect our electoral system from Russia.
@realDonaldTrump That is a poll taken of the Trump family, right?
@mike_nahpetsmc @realDonaldTrump Brilliant response, considering you have no idea what I do. Also, one can do a lot without being productive. Trump may do a lot, but most of it will have to be undone by the next President. #FakePresidentTrump
@realDonaldTrump @foxandfriends Here we go. You‚Äôre off and running early today. Why don‚Äôt you put down your phone and hit the gym. #fakeTrump
@realDonaldTrump @GreggJarrett Can‚Äôt wait to see your tweets about Woodward‚Äôs new book.
@realDonaldTrump You forgot to thank him for continuing to advance his nuclear arsenal.
@lauriecrosswell China
@realDonaldTrump It is pathetic, but comforting, to know that you will be spending the next 3 months doing nothing but tweeting insane and incriminating thoughts and campaigning for GOP candidates, rather than working.
@AriMelber Clearly, Donald continues to suffer from foot in mouth disease. #TrumpIsAMoron
@realDonaldTrump Nobody really cares.
@FoxNews @IngrahamAngle What did he promise you for turning a blind eye to his garbage?
@FoxNews @IngrahamAngle First, it‚Äôs not economic recovery. The economy was on a steady upswing before Trump stole the election. Second, the economy ebbs and flows independent of POTUS. Third, the dems will reverse his dictatorial policies and restore democracy, our global reputation and human decency.
@brilemburg You do realize what that something is, right? üò≥
@kasie Wrongfully convicted accountant escapes prison.
@Pike90104456 I watched and will agree to  disagree. I am wise enough to know the ‚Äúpolitical establishment ‚Äú is flawed and has engaged in corrupt practices. Most of those issues fall on Congress. The Pres has to separate himself from that, rep us to the world as honest, moral and trustworthy.
@Pike90104456 What if pigs could fly?  Trump is beyond corrupt. He is a disgrace to the human race.
@realDonaldTrump I guess you have nothing to worry about then, unless the phrase ‚Äúcriminal conspiracy ‚Äú concerns you. #conspiracy

@maydaymindy9 What is he gonna do without a phone behind bars?
@realDonaldTrump The saddest part of your tweet is that you are proud of yourself with no regrets about kidnapping innocent children and separating them from their families forever. The next saddest thing is that your followers will sleep just as well as you tonight. #KeepFamiliesTogether
@FranklyMDIDGAD @BrendaBlakely7 @1776Stonewall I take it as a compliment. California is far ahead of a large portion of this country in progressive thinking, human rights and human decency.
@aubergine20 Again, why bring up Obama?  Typical Trump tactics. Deflect and blame others.
@aubergine20 Why do we need a press conference from Hillary?  She is just an ordinary citizen. You are falling into Trump‚Äôs trap of deflecting and blaming others.
@aubergine20 It should tell you something when a dozen or more news outlets are all accused of being ‚Äúfake‚Äù and only one is touted as telling the truth by Trump, despite being proven liars numerous times.
@ledesmarubio @1776Stonewall Seriously? I know him by watching and listening to him and those that know him. There are plenty of sources of information besides Sean Hannity.
@ledesmarubio @1776Stonewall You don‚Äôt need to watch the news, fake or otherwise, to know the kind of disgusting human being Trump is.
@BrendaBlakely7 @1776Stonewall Thank you
@1776Stonewall Who cares? How many of them work at Fox?  Can‚Äôt we just assume that every journalist who doesn‚Äôt work for Fox has a vile opinion of Trump and that it is well-deserved?
@PikachuSerena I guess it means something if you value the opinion of a Trump supporter. Michelle Obama was and is an amazing role model. End of story.
@brilemburg Go for it.
@1776Stonewall You can‚Äôt possibly believe that.
@realDonaldTrump I love these tweets that show how scared and desperate you are. #TraitorTrump
@1776Stonewall Wait until he becomes president and she is right there in the White House as his special advisor. I am sure all of the Trumpers will complain and the rest of us will all be thinking ‚Äúkarma is a bitch.‚Äù
@jules_su @MalcolmNance I am hoping for the opposite where Junior throws daddy under the bus.
@FoxNews @JudgeJeanine What do we have to lose?  How about democracy, our allies, respect, world order, dignity, integrity, constitutional rights, human decency and human lives, to name a few.
@brilemburg Sorry. Good news is that tomorrow starts a new week. üòÄ
@Lawrence With all that hard work, he must be an expert cheater by now.
@realDonaldTrump You probably wouldn‚Äôt want most of us there.
@realDonaldTrump I guess it‚Äôs the democrats and fake news media versus Fox news and the corrupt, traitorous, criminal lying Republican administration. I‚Äôll side with the Democrats and fake news media. #TraitorGOP
Is it too far-fetched to assume that Putin told Trump to cancel their meeting at the White House because he would rather meet on his turf? #MoscowMule
@JonHeyman Why?
@smerconish @realDonaldTrump Unemployment can go to zero, the GDP can go to ten percent, but a crime is a crime. Everyone knows he is guilty of numerous crimes. Will mueller reveal it all before his term is over?  We can only hope.
I have never been a fan of politicizing confirmations of Supreme Court justices, but with the failure of our other two branches to end this presidency, saving our democracy may depend solely on the judicial branch. Kavanaugh must be blocked. #KavanaughSCOTUS
Tonight‚Äôs @maddow show revealed convincingly that the White House deleted significant portions of transcript and video recording of the infamous Helsinki joint press conference. Altering official government docs? How is this allowed?

@maddow Just FYI Rachel, that is called a sidebar. Love your show. Keep up the amazing work you do.
@realDonaldTrump You‚Äôre going all in today. I guess we can look forward to a tweet about the NFL next. #desperateDonald

@FoxNews @KellyannePolls @JudgeJeanine Really?  What about all of his hostile tweets towards kim Jung Un and many others?
@FoxNews @KellyannePolls @JudgeJeanine He got elected because he connected directly to the Kremlin.
@a_cormier_ Distraction from the Russian scandal and/or removing a bargaining chip from Cohen when he decides to flip on Trump. In other words, it is one less piece of evidence that he can offer up in exchange for immunity.
@RJNewsflash This is sheer unAmerican propaganda. If CNN is reporting lies, then it goes to follow that ABC, CBS, NBC, and virtually every other major news source are also reporting lies, but for one - FOX. Anyone who seriously believes that, is just foolish
@realDonaldTrump It‚Äôs not ‚Äúbreaking in‚Äù when you have a valid search warrant and it is not illegal to record someone. However, at least you are correct in stating that Obama did nothing wrong.
@realDonaldTrump Maybe you should take some classes in negotiating. An effective negotiator can be tough, diplomatic and respectful, but must first have a goal and a plan. You have none of these attributes.
@LannyDavis @MichaelCohen212 But will it hurt Trump?
@FoxNews @KellyannePolls @BarackObama That was Obama‚Äôs true vision for Americans. A lie is a false statement knowing it to be untrue at the time it was made. Unfortunately, Obama‚Äôs vision was derailed by Trump‚Äôs sabotage of the ACA.
@1776Stonewall True, but Neo-Nazis are from numerous places, including the USA.
@RepMattGaetz How do you plan on finding out what happened in their private meeting?  Please share your insight.
@realDonaldTrump Looks like you stayed up most of the night trying to come up with a plan to fix the damage you caused and all you came up with is to tweet how great you are based on more lies. Nobody of ‚Äúhigher intelligence ‚Äú buys your garbage.

@donmattinglyws @calloway_paige Way to go Drew!!
@realDonaldTrump Is that the best deflection you can come up with?
@BillKristol I am sure Churchill just turned over in his grave.
@smerconish @realDonaldTrump Trump will ask Putin if he meddled, accept Putin‚Äôs blanket denial and move on. Of course, he will tell us he ‚Äúconfronted ‚Äú Putin and that Putin agreed not to do it again. Trump will believe that because Putin shook his hand.
@RepMattGaetz The text messages obviously spoke for themselves and Mueller immediately removed him from the investigation.
@GolicAndWingo Actually, 7/11 coffee is just as good.
@realDonaldTrump What are you complaining about? Some of that money is probably winding up in your pocket.
@KFILE So, you are saying that we shouldn‚Äôt trust CNN for thoroughly investigating the very serious and newsworthy claims that you had knowledge and may have failed to do something about sexual abuse allegations of your student athletes?  That isn‚Äôt fake news. It‚Äôs diligent journalism.
@realDonaldTrump Well, you certainly know all about obstructing.
@HallieJackson Or maybe he will wait to berate them via Twitter after he leaves, like his cowardly self typically does.
@GolicAndWingo By definition, a sandwich requires two pieces of bread. A hotdog bun is one piece; at least it starts out that way.
@GolicAndWingo Free college is great, but there are still living expenses and athletes have no ability to even take a part time job. A stipend to cover those basic needs would be fair.
@realDonaldTrump Let‚Äôs see if Cohen, Manafort, Flynn and others also get cold feet. Doesn‚Äôt look like it and I am sure after they testify, justice will prevail.
@brilemburg ‚ÄúThe Killing.‚Äù  There are 4 seasons. I am binge watching it now and it is excellent.
@TimothyGothard1 @SenJeffMerkley Doesn‚Äôt it seem peculiar and concerning that Trump would want a private meeting with an enemy of democracy, especially given all the suspicions surrounding him and numerous others regarding collusion and interference with our elections?
@RepAdamSchiff Nice try, but you know that logic won‚Äôt work. GOP can argue that it was a presidential election, not midterm elections and that is a huge difference as it relates to confirming a Justice of the Supreme Court. Need a better strategy, but doubtful there is one.
@FoxNews Giuliani is so confident Trump is innocent that it must be because Trump told him he was innocent while they shook hands.
@realDonaldTrump Let me get this straight. You want everyone who doubts that Un would honor your ‚Äúdeal‚Äù to now erase those doubts because you shook Un‚Äôs hand?  I hope you realize how ridiculous that sounds, but I am pretty sure your base will believe it.
@SenJeffMerkley Or sit down alone for a private meeting with that foreign power‚Äôs leader.
@realDonaldTrump First, it sounds like you want twitter accounts that make false claims banned. You might want to rethink that position.  Second, your ‚Äúopinion‚Äù on anonymous sources is irrelevant. Third, those businesses will be around a lot longer than your presidency.
@HobackSara @MichaelAvenatti Amen to that. I like the impact Avenatti has made as well, but his potential candidacy is not stemmed from a desire to serve, but rather from his popularity.
@joncoopertweets @MichaelAvenatti Nope.
@FoxNews @realDonaldTrump @GillianHTurner Sadly, Trump will likely first deny the legitimacy of the reports and then he will blame the democrats and the ‚Äúfake news‚Äù media. He should admit that Kim lied to him and begin putting our military exercises with South Korea back in operation immediately.
@JonHeyman If the left handed hitters would learn to hit to the opposite field or, god forbid, learn to lay down a bunt, this issue would go away. Baseball is a game of adjustments.
@RodRosenstien @realDonaldTrump Wishful thinking. Trump has never shown a concern for the well-being of the people of this country and is not about to start now.
@FoxNews @charliekirk11 And your reporting is more about pleasing Trump than telling the truth.
@FoxNews And this should surprise no one. We also should not be surprised when Trump blames democrats and/or the media for his failed ‚Äúdeal.‚Äù
@marcorubio Come on Marco, we all know Republican politicians that side with Trump are making that decision based solely on what will get them re-elected.
@lauriecrosswell Sophia Loren
@realDonaldTrump It‚Äôs still a lot better than the face of the White House.
@EricofRochester @smerconish @PressSec Is there footage of that?  First I have heard that one.
@smerconish @PressSec I agree with someone taking a stand against immorality without regard to political consequences, which she seemingly did.
@davidaxelrod @PressSec @POTUS Politicizing Trump‚Äôs mistreatment of refugee families is criticized by most everyone, but if the owner of a restaurant makes a choice from her heart, she is accused of politicizing the issue as well. Isn‚Äôt it time to just do what is morally right?
@brilemburg I assume you asked him to stop. If he continues to message you, you might want to ask him more firmly, with a polite reply to his interest in you but an underlying message that you hope he respects your wishes so this doesn‚Äôt have to start involving others.
@ondawuey @tedlieu @hwinkler4real @EvanJKessler Or maybe it was just funny.
@RealDonaldTrFan I imagine if she was gay and had told you, she wouldn‚Äôt be your press secretary.
@FoxNews @realDonaldTrump @GaryKaltbaum @BarackObama There is nothing wrong with that view, but Trump has no real view. He just acts to improve his image. There is no real thought on principles or ideology.
@FoxNews @realDonaldTrump INTEGRITY??  Did she say that with a straight face?
@marcorubio @FLOTUS Nobody deserves vicious treatment, but not sure what your definition of vicious is. She received a large dose of criticism, which was definitely warranted and which she invited by wearing the jacket and not offering a rational explanation for it. Btw, it‚Äôs ‚ÄúTotal‚Äù, not ‚ÄúTotally.‚Äù
@brilemburg Anton‚Äôs defense improved substantially towards the end of the season. He will ultimately be better than Embiid.
@realDonaldTrump I‚Äôd like to hear her say that.
@krassenstein You know they will falsely portray him as heroic in being able and willing to solve this horrific problem on his own because the democrats refused to work with the Republicans to fix what they created.
@SteveSchmidtSES @Lawrence I can relate. After 37 years of being a Republican, I renounced my membership on November 8, 2016.
@maddow Please don‚Äôt feel like you have to apologize for having a heart. You are extremely professional, informative and thought-provoking. Keep up the fantastic work you do.
@realDonaldTrump @FLOTUS @WhiteHouse I hope they didn‚Äôt bring their children.

@realDonaldTrump It‚Äôs a giant conspiracy promulgated by the entire FBI, the Democratic Party and only those Republican congressmen retiring soon, and you still somehow got elected and have never broken any laws. Sadly, there are actually people that believe that.
@FoxNews @JesseBWatters Obama was that far when he left office. Trump brought us closer to the brink of war with his tweets. Now he is playing nice, but in reality, that merely returns things to the way they were before Trump engaged in his name calling.
@mschlapp Here is a fact - Trump lied 19 times this morning. Moral condemnation would be calling him a pathological liar. Seems like Katy stuck to the facts.
@FoxNews @POTUS That ‚Äúsomething ‚Äú was more like 144 days and hopefully long enough for you to join him.
@realDonaldTrump The media are correct. You don‚Äôt see reality because you are blinded by your narcissism.
@brilemburg Dunkin.
@realDonaldTrump The fact that you are drawing that conclusion so prematurely is enough to keep me up all night.
@smerconish The danger our nation faces stems from the uncompromising ego of Trump. I am certain KJU is fully aware of that condition and will exploit it to his advantage in getting Trump to do almost anything to keep this deal in tact.
@kaitlancollins That is horrifying. The only thing more horrifying than that would be Trump being left alone in a room with my daughter.

@AmbassadorRice Let‚Äôs face it- Trump‚Äôs biggest concern about this meeting is what tie to wear for the photo ops.

@FoxNews @JudgeJeanine @Comey Are you insane?  You believe Trump and he is the epitome of lies, dishonesty and contradictions.
@AshaRangappa_ Tell her to ask the President. He certainly knows.
@smerconish Are you kidding me? Trump shouldn‚Äôt be allowed to brush his teeth without congressional authorization.
@krassenstein @Anericangirl2 It‚Äôs normal for Fox. In fact, it is beyond predictable that it‚Äôs response to that type of news is to misdirect viewers to false narratives about Clinton and/or Obama.
@ananavarro That picture.
@brianstelter Of course they are. Anything to help Trump deflect and distract.
@MLBONFOX Yanks!

@wesley_jordan My understanding is that there is a prenup that protects Trump assets in the event of a divorce. If junior does not try to enforce it and instead hands over assets to his wife, you may have a definitive answer.
@happyITgirl6327 @APlayersProgram Thanks. I am still distraught over what happened and now I think Miller needs to go. UA needs a fresh start.
@ZonaZealots The way they played, I am guessing they declared right before the game started.
@TucsonStar I sure hope so. Can‚Äôt imagine too many worse upsets by any team, much less Arizona.

I will never complain about east coast bias again. New York-3, PAC-12 - 0.

@DickieV Have you expressed shock over USC getting snubbed or are you and the selection committee still ignoring west coast basketball?

@smerconish @FBI @realDonaldTrump Voting on this question is useless, given the fact that few, if anyone, knows the truth. However, under the circumstances of conducting this type of investigation, it is difficult to believe Mueller would risk everything he has done to hide some text messages.
@realDonaldTrump Let me guess - they all work for Fox.
@ghansen711 Kevin O‚ÄôNeill is a bitter ex-coach of the Cats who shows it time and again. There are 4 other teammates on the floor and we are a better team when the focus is not on only one of them.
@smerconish @MichaelWolffNYC @WhiteHouse Not really. The question is whether the representations in his book are verifiable.
@KFILE Maybe because their homes and lives were destroyed by an earthquake.
@FoxNews @BarackObama The problem is that Fox viewers believe that virtually all other news sources are ‚Äúfake,‚Äù whereas most others gather information from several sources.
@smerconish @realDonaldTrump Given the numerous comments and general behavior of Trump over the years and knowing that he lacks the requisite intelligence to understand the economic impact his comments may have, the only logical conclusion is that it was racist.
@kendallybrown I bet he knows every word of Russia‚Äôs national anthem.
@MLBNetwork Correa is the one.
@realDonaldTrump And the rest of us have to put up with a fake President. And you are going to ‚Äúhandle it well?‚Äù  When can we expect that to start?  It‚Äôs been a year and you have so far handled most everything like a spoiled child.
@GeraldoRivera @MichaelWolffNYC @POTUS @realDonaldTrump Regardless of whether it‚Äôs 100% or some other percentage, neither of which you or anyone else truly knows, even if it is only a handful of people, it is certainly worrisome.
