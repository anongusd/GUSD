The only crisis is the one the President created. This policy has already led to the deaths of two children and will undoubtedly create lifelong trauma. Pres. Trump must invest in Central America to address root causes of migration rather than threatening to cut off aid. (4/5) https://t.co/zbfJla41tj
The Administration claimed border patrol stopped 4,000 potential terrorists from crossing the border in 2018. The real number? SIX. (3/5) https://t.co/SyCnWHMULY
There is only a TRUMP MANUFACTURED crisis at the southern border. According to the Homeland Security Dept. illegal immigration on the Southern border has REACHED THE LOWEST LEVEL ON RECORD, but the President continues to pressure Congress to fund AN INEFFECTIVE BORDER WALL. (2/5) https://t.co/6bo2FQaV9c
Trump has been threatening to call a national emergency if he doesn’t get $5 billion to fix the “crisis” HE CREATED at the Southern border. The fear-mongering the President has spread is wildly incorrect and will not solve the immigration issues our country faces. (1/5) https://t.co/7aBsm80N80

Rising drug costs have real implications for working families: a @KaiserFamFound survey found that about a quarter of Americans didn’t fill a prescription in the previous year because of the high cost. Americans demand #ABetterDeal. Today, President Trump failed to offer one.
In Oct., when @EnergyCommerce Dems &amp; I voted in favor of letting #Medicare negotiate lower drug prices—which the President once claimed to support—@HouseGOP members voted it down. That idea was absent from President Trump’s speech today. Another in a long list of broken promises
Rising drug prices are a key concern for millions of American families. Today, President Trump had an opportunity to champion meaningful, comprehensive action for consumers struggling with the rising costs of prescription drugs – &amp; he failed. My statement: https://t.co/QhmNc4Z7le

Today, @HouseDemocrats and I voted to consider an ambitious plan to address the high cost of prescription drugs. But instead of fighting Rx drug pricing, @HouseGOP is working to kick millions off of health care. Americans demand #ABetterDeal.

Scrapping the #IranDeal undermines the leverage we have to address Iran’s ballistic missiles, support for terrorism, and human-rights abuses. President Trump just set us back on those critical goals.
President Trump alone bears the responsibility for the consequences of the dangerous decision to pull the plug on the #IranDeal.
The President’s decision to walk away from #IranDeal makes it easier for Iran to get a bomb &amp; undermines American credibility on the world stage. #Trump created this crisis.

Don't be fooled by the Republican blame game. #GOP decides what we vote on. If they cared about kids' care, they would have heeded Democrats' pleas to renew #CHIP before it expired in Sept. &amp; would hold a CHIP vote now w/o strings attached #TrumpShutdown
The priorities Americans want to see addressed, including funding for community health centers, protecting #DREAMers, and providing health care for kids (#CHIP), aren't controversial. Its sad that instead of working w/#Dems to do those things, #GOP has opted for a #TrumpShutdown.
Republicans' failure to govern led to the #TrumpShutdown. @HouseDemocrats won't be coerced into voting for spending bills that don't address the most pressing issues facing our nation. When Republicans are ready to work with us, we are right here https://t.co/Hlys2OxXYh
I was honored to join so many #NY16 constituents during last year’s #WomensMarch on Washington. Today’s marches amplify the message we sent a year ago: Americans won’t sit idly by as our rights, safety and health are attacked by this Administration.
My fellow #Democrats and I refuse to be coerced. We have been consistent in our desire to put petty politics aside and begin fixing the many problems our country faces. It’s time the #GOP joined us in that effort.
The #GOP, which controls the House, Senate, and White House, had months to address the most pressing issues facing our nation. We told them time and again to put forward a bill that dealt with the issues our constituents are facing, and they failed. Now, we have a #GOPshutdown https://t.co/zw1pk6irUM
