RT @ryanstruyk: Schiff says the House Intelligence Committee will be releasing Cohen's testimony publicly in the future
@J_Dunc13 @letsgetupsidedn @EricHolder The whole system was set up when the population disparity was different. Just saying it needs to be re-evaluated.  Senate has so much control and its actions don‚Äôt reflect what the people actually want. More parity is needed while maintaining the general concept.
@letsgetupsidedn @J_Dunc13 @EricHolder Understood but it is far from fair. The tiny red states are essentially deciding on key issues for the whole country. That was not the intent. It needs to be reformed to reflect population dispersion as of today.  No, we should not have large blue states deciding everything.
@letsgetupsidedn @J_Dunc13 @EricHolder I just want the system to be fair. As structured it is fundamentally unfair and does not reflect the will of the populace.
@EricHolder Of course I understand the difference between the House and the Senate. However, the Senate has many controls that the House does not, such as approval of SCOTUS judges and cabinet members. Why should California have just two votes on important things like the SCOTUS?  Disagree!
@EricHolder Could not agree more.  I also disagree with two senators per state. CA has an enormous population compared to Wyoming. How is this equitable?
@latimes @latimesopinion Great piece. Sorry for your loss. This national epidemic needs a lot more focus. I live in La Quinta also.
@DavidChalian @TODAYshow David , please comment on the hiring of Sarah I. Many of us loyal viewers find this to be totally unacceptable

@RandyRainbow Your best one yet, until the next one. So freaking talented!
@RandyRainbow Brilliant just absolutely brilliant. Love ya

@ananavarro And the Senate quietly lifted sanctions on Russia and derepaska. Shame.
@rmayemsinger And when will everyone stop talking about it ?
@dark_lasher Huh?  He supported trump on most things. His words were meaningless. #CorkerKickback  he could‚Äôve made a difference but didn‚Äôt even try.
@clairecmc Congrats. Just today was wondering what you and Heidi heitkamp are up to. Glad you are not fading away. We need you in this fight.

@Goss30Goss The way they took things away from McCabe and Strzok, it‚Äôs only right to treat Flynn the same way.  Plus, they‚Äôve trashed the FBI‚Äôs reputation (Trump did) and has hurt recruitment
@chrislhayes For that matter, they should be focused on all voter suppression/fraud, and reforming electoral college. I‚Äôll never agree that California should only have two senators and why should Iowa/New Hampshire pick our candidates?  And California votes don‚Äôt matter due to time zones. Wtf

@BillKristol @lordxmen2k Who wants him there anyway. He‚Äôd find a way to ruin it.
@kay_kingsbury @JRubinBlogger You say you‚Äôre an aspiring Christian. Is it Christlike to demonize those who vote for Democrats by calling them #Demonrats and suggesting they‚Äôre dumb?  You‚Äôre extremely divisive and a #FakeChristian. Acosta is not the enemy of the people. He‚Äôs trying to expose injustice.
@JRubinBlogger Trying to shutting him down by grabbing away the mic is just so uncivilized and repressive.  Degrading for the woman too, forcing her to kneel. They should maybe give stated time limitations and cut the mic if exceeded. Such an embarrassment.
@PhilipRucker @Acosta How degrading that she has to kneel on the floor. Would it be so bad to have the mic person in the shot?  Clearly he did not purposely touch her. Just the opposite m.

@NadineNardine @bartonrn82 @KellyO @VP @realDonaldTrump I don‚Äôt think so. Retiring for health reasons would be weak in terms of how he thinks of himself. Fancies himself as invincible.

@TeresaSlate1 @nancyfuqindrew @leetoph @MistyMayTreanor There are many other ways for MMT to give back and impact child fitness. IMO the cost of normalizing the Trump admin is not worth whatever small benefit she may bring about by aligning w/him. Agree to disagree. Still shocked that MMT would lower herself to appear at the WH.
RT @Amy_Siskind: I stand with Samantha Bee @iamsambee. Retweet if you agree.
@TeresaSlate1 @nancyfuqindrew @leetoph @MistyMayTreanor The military is supposed to be apolitical. He is commander in chief but they serve the country. I don‚Äôt criticize them for serving under trump due to their supposedly apolitical stance.
@TeresaSlate1 @nancyfuqindrew @leetoph @MistyMayTreanor As soon as you can show us the major impact MMT is having on child fitness, it would be appreciated. Thanks
@TeresaSlate1 @nancyfuqindrew @leetoph @MistyMayTreanor What about criticizing those who normalize Trump is ‚Äúnot right‚Äù?  Not right TO YOU?  We each have our own moral compass. Not sure what you are getting at. Hitler was normalized by many athletes and celebrities. I‚Äôm not ok with it.
@TeresaSlate1 @nancyfuqindrew @leetoph @MistyMayTreanor Conscientious objection to illegitimate and corrupt politicians is the American way. Yes, I take issue with civilians who are normalizing him. It‚Äôs my first amendment right (as long as I still have that) to express my disagreement with those who normalize the admin. Incl MMT
@CoreysDigs @therealroseanne Do you even know what racist hate speech is?  Seems you don‚Äôt.
@TeresaSlate1 @nancyfuqindrew @leetoph @MistyMayTreanor It was nothing more than a silly photo op and MMT was a prop. Their little ceremony will have ZERO impact on anything.   It is a problem that needs to be addressed but Trump surely will have zero impact. He does not believe in exercise.
@ZoohGirl @RobynAnn67 @Trump4Prez_DUH @therealroseanne Here is what I was responding to https://t.co/srZMt5jOxx
@therealroseanne Hate speech has consequences
@RobynAnn67 @ZoohGirl @Trump4Prez_DUH @therealroseanne Just because Ivanka is Jewish doesn‚Äôt mean SB‚Äôs comment was racist. It was about IT‚Äôs inaction. You‚Äôre conflating two things.
@therealroseanne YOU forgive THEM??  That‚Äôs rich. Turn off your twitter racist lady.
@MistyMayTreanor You are normalizing him.  You know that‚Äôs bad, right?  Im especially shocked given that you‚Äôre a Californian. Lost my respect for you in an instant. I guess we know who you are now.
@Justice4Kennedy @therealroseanne @Sheila4USA Roseanne‚Äôs tweets speak for themselves. Sara is a decent person and had no choice but to call out Roseanne.  It was a no win situation. Roseanne blew it for everyone.
@KyleKashuv @Leney_3 @davidhogg111 @realDonaldTrump Kyle is obsessed with David Hogg. Sad to see these kids very divided.

@AJDelgado13 Of course you would defend her. After how the Trump admin has treated you, how can you still defend them?  Where is your common sense and self respect?  She‚Äôs an absolute liar and complicit in trump‚Äôs misdeeds. Press conferences are beyond useless. Wake up AJ.
@DaKineFiveO @GeraldoRivera @TomiLahren Who is in the photo?

@trish_regan And you‚Äôll never regain the credibility that you‚Äôve lost.
@trish_regan Unfortunately your accomplishments are greatly diminished by your extremely poor judgement in deciding to work for Fox.
@CBreasbois @dandorotik @AJDelgado13 And she‚Äôs having domestic disputes with a huge trump sycophant. I think people give AJ too much credit on this one.

@brownsugar7878 @RyanLizza @MichaelAvenatti @CNN I won‚Äôt defend Ryan regarding this Avenatti thing but from what I‚Äôve read, he did not get a fair shake on the #MeToo case.

@dcasey1992 @TomiLahren Could not agree more. The woman is toxic and hateful. This statement from her makes NO sense whatsoever.

@SamH70394985 @benshapiro Art can be a mirror (or spotlight) on what‚Äôs happening in the world.  It‚Äôs also a powerful weapon in the fight for America‚Äôs heart and soul. I applaud Jim Carrey. I disparage people like Ben Shapiro.
@SamH70394985 @benshapiro Indeed. They‚Äôve drunk the koolaid and are in a  delusional, permanent state of denial. Maybe they‚Äôll wake up someday  when there is incontrovertible proof.
@benshapiro Don‚Äôt you people know anything about art?  It‚Äôs a form of expression, has been since the dawn of man. He‚Äôs expressing his thoughts and feelings about current events. I have great appreciation for his art and the meaning behind it. It‚Äôs similar to political comic strips.
@ABC Sean Hannity?  That‚Äôs what he sounds like to me.
@johnrobertsFox @BretBaier How does it feel to know 90% of your followers are MAGA idiots?  As a supposed journalist with integrity, it must make your job feel rather unfulfilling.
@bobclendenin Seriously?
@ASchlossberg_ It‚Äôs a fake account. He‚Äôs a coward and a racist.
@Tru7hS33kR @LouDobbs @POTUS Never liked him but it‚Äôs sad to see a one-respected reputation trashed in a short amount of time. He‚Äôll be remembered as a delusional Trump sycophant and a joke.
@TexasLuvee @SRuhle @MSNBC @KatyTurNBC Yes, both very cute. I‚Äôm used to them being serious and tough journalists. It‚Äôs odd to see them this way. The distraction is a good thing I suppose.
@SRuhle @TexasLuvee @MSNBC @KatyTurNBC Where‚Äôs Katy‚Äôs hat?
@JohnHMcWhorter @HelloDollyBway Lucky girl!  So cute!
@greggutfeld I‚Äôd rather eat nails
@realDonaldTrump Lol. Melanie. You‚Äôre a joke
@CNNPolitics Certainly not shocking for most Americans to hear about yet another school shooting. It‚Äôs just part of life here when we have basically no regulation of gun ownership.
@SenTedCruz Those prayers should save a lot of lives. Tx loser
@alexandersikare But how did you like Aaron Schlossberg?
@Bencjacobs The single most disqualifying factor related to newsom is that he was once married to her. Other than that, i like him.
@realDonaldTrump Who??  Lol good luck with that
@AJDelgado13 The Trump admin is and you‚Äôve urged America to support him, suggesting he‚Äôs the greatest thing since sliced bread. See the connection?
@AJDelgado13 AJ, you are part of the problem. You‚Äôre one of them. You‚Äôve promoted what we are experiencing. Prove me wrong.

I‚Äôm watching Fox News‚Äô coverage of the Southwest plane accident. At the same time, I keep wondering when and how they are going to twist the story in a way that blames hillary and obama for the accident. Sad.
@eatkinson48 @KyleKashuv @davidhogg111 He‚Äôs a nazi because he doesn‚Äôt want more children murdered in school?  Y‚Äôall need a reality check. Step back and think about what these kids have endured.
@kenolin1 @enoughoforange Honestly I‚Äôm just surprised the skeletons didn‚Äôt come out much sooner. We KNEW he was going to have baggage. It‚Äôs a miracle it took this long for it to begin to cone out. Gotta be much more to come.
@realdjmcdowell @realDonaldTrump I will save 0.10% in 2018. Should I be grateful for him exploding the National debt??  I‚Äôm not.
@realDonaldTrump My savings will be 0.10% in California. That sux!!!  Thanks for nothing but more national debt. Fake news
@PatriciaCavend1 @PatrickPetty23 @davidhogg111 @cameron_kasky I don‚Äôt know his exact whereabouts but he attends a school where 17 were brutally murdered. The whole community is traumatized (even those who didn‚Äôt directly witness actual carnage). Try and have a heart if you think you‚Äôre so patriotic and MAGA-minded.
@PatriciaCavend1 @PatrickPetty23 @davidhogg111 @cameron_kasky It‚Äôs very unpatriotic to attack a survivor of a mass high school shooting. Don‚Äôt you have compassion for ALL the kids?    Or just the ones who share your views?
@PatriciaCavend1 @PatrickPetty23 @davidhogg111 @cameron_kasky What‚Äôs funny about riding a bike?  Any excuse to bash him?
@KyleKashuv Boycotting things is part of our first amendment rights. Peaceful protests are a key part of American activism. I applaud  @davidhogg111 !!  Kyle has chosen to align himself with the likes of Cernovich, which is sad but in America we all have the freedom to choose.

@rswfire It sounds EXACTLY like something trump would say. It fits 100% with his personality
@TheScarletT2 @Montgomery_bjm @LeChatNoire4 It‚Äôs funny, I had a similar thought. In ‚ÄúThe Handmaid‚Äôs Tale‚Äù they describe Congress being taken out by a militia attack . Chilling.
@realDonaldTrump It‚Äôs no wonder you can‚Äôt find any New attorneys
@KyleKashuv Speaking as an Angeleno, I absolutely love @tedlieu !!  Kyle, it breaks my heart to see you are now a full-on right wing troll. I hope you come to your senses some day.
@Kris_Sacrebleu With this style, they are always too big or too small. There is no perfect size given how they are designed.
@Kris_Sacrebleu Those are cute but trust me, they will not stay on right due to the design. They will constantly slip off the back of the ankle and will likely cause blisters. That shoe design, structurally, is a fail. Cute style though!
@brithume She‚Äôs a human being you know. You may not like how she makes a living but you should still respect her as an American- a patriotic one at that. Brit, I thought you were above this kind of bullying and locker room talk. She‚Äôs part of the story and history WILL be kind to her.
@Pantages I‚Äôve been trying to do that for several days and it doesn‚Äôt work!  Your upgrade process simply doesn‚Äôt work. So frustrating. When you select what you want to upgrade then it just hourglasses endlessly. Also no answer to multiple calls. Hours of my life wasted.
@tonyposnanski I‚Äôm still shocked that trump pretended to care about what his wife thinks or feels
This is an absolute outrage. I hope the family sues and the throw the book at the prankster.    Cop Who Killed Man After ‚ÄòSwat‚Äô Hoax Call Won‚Äôt Be Charged https://t.co/ISUfxpxSjq via @thedailybeast
@DEEZ_curls @poloholic_214 Totally agree
@beachgor The last thing I‚Äôm inclined to do is defend this guy but for the sake of due process I have to ask about evidence and anything beyond her allegations.
@beachgor I‚Äôm a liberal Democrat and hear mostly bad things about this guy. However, there is the possibility that this is indeed a witch hunt. He‚Äôs admitted to an affair and there is no evidence of the allegations. What am I missing?  In America there is due process. Right?
@beachgor Thanks. Seems like the only evidence is a recording between the woman and her husband. The case is all about her allegations. I don‚Äôt understand why she would have consensual relations several times if the first time was as described?
@sarahkendzior @beachgor Do they have evidence against the governor, or just accusations at this point? Just curious.
@rebeccagberg The accusations are obviously horrible. Does anyone know if evidence exists to back up the accusations?
@bigleaguepol Erik Erickson is not a never trumper. Or is he??
@ADSCPP @chelseahandler @TomSteyer Start a separate thread then.  This one is about impeachment. Stay on topic.
@DEEZ_curls @poloholic_214 Guys like this give guys a bad name.  They‚Äôre trash and clearly do not respect women.
@HoodSocialist Good lord I sure hope this kind of thing becomes less and less the norm as a result of the #MeToo movement. These guys have zero respect for women and clearly view them as objects. How come being ‚Äúslutty‚Äù is a one-way Street? Total double standard. Hope their moms are ashamed.
RT @krassenstein: In the age of Sean Hannity, America needs to pay respect to @maddow 		Please RETWEET her your appreciation.  I know it's‚Ä¶
@ADSCPP @chelseahandler @TomSteyer What does that have to do with her freely expressing her opinions about politics?  Trump is a crook and bad for America. Everyone is allowed to express their views regardless of reproductive and personal details.
@Karoli @92660voter Yeah and when they called the front desk, no answer.
@Karoli I have thought of him many times since it happened. Interesting article about how desperate he was to get out of that building but couldn‚Äôt sell at a decent price (and who would want to buy into that dreadful building?). My heart goes out to him. Crickets from trump.
@Exposingfrauds7 Could not agree more.  It‚Äôs sad that after everything that‚Äôs happened, McConnell and Ryan will block a vote on protecting Mueller.  They‚Äôll be remembered as complicit for the rest of their lives. Throw them all out , especially Pruitt! Brazen corruption.
@Exposingfrauds7 The lesser of many evils I suppose....anyone but trump or pence!
@Exposingfrauds7 Certainly not. But I would support John Kasich over Nikki Haley any day of the week. As a woman, it‚Äôs hard for me to say that, but it‚Äôs just too important. She‚Äôs too Trumpian.
@Exposingfrauds7 Pass.  Totally pass. No thanks. Not impressed.
@wileyeecoyote Lol clever
@JenniferJJacobs @Susan_Hennessey He‚Äôs a total trump sycophant. Trump may be elevating him to a higher position (just a guess)
@RealMuckmaker Hilarious!
@MelissaJPeltier Renato is terrific and an important voice today. Just FYI - his run for attorney general in Illinois is over. He fell short in the primary. Glad we are seeing a lot more of him on tv now that the primary is over.
@tonyposnanski What about every who went after Michelle obama?  That‚Äôs ok because she was a Democrat and/or African American?  #EvangelicalHypocrites
@JeffreyGuterman IMO people are overreacting. I‚Äôm with you. Trumps are scum. Nbd
@larnold67 @JeffreyGuterman Do you ever wonder why there is such hate?  Give it some thought. It‚Äôs not for no reason.
@tweetmommybop @Go_already And have no problem with all the people who slammed Michelle obama. Total hypocrisy

@Msla406 @jasoninthehouse @TGowdySC @SenatorTimScott I recommend that you get your news from multiple sources and try listening to the more liberal media once in a while. With all due respect, I‚Äôve never trusted a president LESS in my entire lifetime. This will not end well. Total disaster on numerous fronts. Agree to disagree.
@Msla406 @jasoninthehouse @TGowdySC @SenatorTimScott Why won‚Äôt you watch Shep and Chris?  They don‚Äôt share your worldview?
@iamAtheistGirl I‚Äôve heard people say they hope Obama‚Äôs daughters get raped. They are absolute trash for saying such things
@Msla406 @jasoninthehouse @TGowdySC @SenatorTimScott *confirmed not elected
@Msla406 @jasoninthehouse @TGowdySC @SenatorTimScott Your president got a SCOTUS judge elected and gave a tax cut to billionaires. Congrats!!  LOL
@Msla406 @jasoninthehouse @TGowdySC @SenatorTimScott You call BS on me watching Fox?  Whatever dude. Hannity and judge Jeanie are entertainment and propaganda shows. I definitely watch them to be aware of the propaganda they are spewing. Call BS all you want. Shepherd Smith is a decent journalist, as is Chris Wallace. That‚Äôs it.
@Msla406 @jasoninthehouse @TGowdySC @SenatorTimScott I‚Äôm not like most MAGAts, living in an echo chamber. I consume news from a lot of different sources.  Ingraham is a vile racist but I watch her and other Fox shows periodically.
@Msla406 @jasoninthehouse @TGowdySC @SenatorTimScott Yesterday he was filling in for ingraham and I watched it. He‚Äôs a terribly unnatural host. Just reading off teleprompter like a zombie.
@Comey @TheBandsVisit Favorite show on Broadway. I loved it so so much!  Glad you saw it.
@jasoninthehouse @TGowdySC @SenatorTimScott You‚Äôre a terrible host. Get some training. You‚Äôre like a robot or high school kid pretending to be on tv. Your commentary is fine but hosting is not your gig. Your opinions are crap of course.
@keithboykin ‚ÄúAre you a hypocrite or a bigot???‚Äù  Great line on the CNN panel this weekend.  I always love your segments and your ability to articulate what is wrong on trumpland.
@jonathanweisman @bariweiss Fantastic interview with Terry Gross. What crazy times we live in.
@AmyKremer Are you a hypocrite or a biggot??  It was a great question directed to you on CNN today. I can‚Äôt tell; maybe you‚Äôre both?
@NHadgisava @PreetBharara @cafedotcom @pineapplemedia @WNYCStudios Ah, that makes sense. It was missing other great ones too like WTF (not a new one). Thanks. The world of podcasting is exploding (which is great!)
@marcyjames @Lochsalaan @JasonTaylor_TX @KyleKashuv You are stereotyping and generalizing about all liberals. And yet the prior tweets against me suggest that I am doing the same about right-wingers. Sometimes we come full circle on Twitter.

@PreetBharara @cafedotcom @pineapplemedia @WNYCStudios Congrats, love the show. Great list as well. Missing a few really good ones but I learned about some podcasts I wasn‚Äôt already listening to. It‚Äôs impossible to keep up with my favorites. It‚Äôs missing Pod Save ______
@PhilippeReines @mflynnJR Frightening to thing the once-Nat Sec advisor has a son who is buddies with cernovich, pushes pizzagate, and comports himself like a dumbass. LOCK THEM UP!
@JeffreyGuterman I recommend listening to the podcast ‚ÄúSlow Burn‚Äù about Watergate. It‚Äôs fascinating and takes you through those years as republicans finally turned on Nixon.
@JillLunagems @SarahPalinUSA How on earth would you have any clue about what I watch or read?  Your comment is ridiculous. Twitter is about expressing opinions and sharing info. You have no standing to tell someone not to comment.
@cbarnella @SarahPalinUSA I‚Äôm calling out a bully. I‚Äôm not the original bully in this equation.
@SarahPalinUSA Who cares???  You just enjoy rubbing Hillary‚Äôs nose in something silly?  You take pleasure in very odd things. Please get a life.  Or a career or a hobby. Would love to someday here You say something uplifting, positive or just nice. Like Hillary does.

Credit where credit is due. Raj Shah is the best press secretary Trump has had. He‚Äôs calm and reasonably straightforward. Doesn‚Äôt preach, yell or intimate that reporters are dumb and Dems are bad. Better than spicer &amp; huckleberry.

@Boomingbox @kissmyb0t @DonMichaud1 @peteislostagain @bob_kirkpatrick @KyleKashuv @davidhogg111 Mueller will provide it soon enough
@Boomingbox @kissmyb0t @DonMichaud1 @peteislostagain @bob_kirkpatrick @KyleKashuv @davidhogg111 The Trump era makes for strange bedfellows. You may have thought you were not allied with Russia but if you continue to support trump then that‚Äôs just what you‚Äôre doing. You are also supporting Israel (and their repression of Palestinians).
@kissmyb0t @DonMichaud1 @peteislostagain @Boomingbox @bob_kirkpatrick @KyleKashuv @davidhogg111 It cracks me up when they respond by tweeting some silly graphic. The photoshoppers are working overtime in Russia so that the deplorables have new material to use when they don‚Äôt have a valid point.

@kissmyb0t @DonMichaud1 @peteislostagain @Boomingbox @bob_kirkpatrick @KyleKashuv @davidhogg111 Deplorables just throw out insults without knowing who they are debating.

It‚Äôs all about keeping people safe and preserving 2A
@kissmyb0t @purpledog4 @TomWWoodJr @KyleKashuv @davidhogg111 It‚Äôs not about the right to bear arms. It‚Äôs about assault weapons and common sense gun reform.
@WangChungTNT @KyleKashuv @davidhogg111 Not a power grab. This is a single issue discussion. People don‚Äôt want to be slaughtered in school and public places. Pretty simple concept.

@KyleKashuv @davidhogg111 Turn on your televisions. The culture is changing. You will be on the wrong side of history. Alt-right twitter and the nra want us to think gun lovers are the majority but it just isn‚Äôt so. 2018 elections will be a major step towards gun reform. Troll all you want, reform coming

@kmgplace2b @SACarrow I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs mostly a deliberate choice not to cover newsworthy stories that are negative towards trump. They are a propaganda machine after all. And their second favorite thing is bashing Clinton/obama/Democrats. Give it a rest already !!!
@TheRickWilson To counter Rachel‚Äôs famous board of firings and resignations, hannity has a board of trump so-called achievements. Flashed on screen for a few seconds. Included ‚Äúsuccessful trip to Asia‚Äù.  Hmmmm really stretching for achievements I‚Äôd say.
@TheRickWilson I forced myself to watch Hannity today. A good chunk was about fake news cnn and Hilary uranium. Barely acknowledged omnibus and Karen McDougal. What a joke
@woolymacith @POTUS Are you pleased about the omnibus spending bill?  The art of the deal, right? Schumer offered to include funding for the wall in exchange for DACA weeks ago but trump blew it. He really doesn‚Äôt know what he‚Äôs doing.
@pambridgetoday @RealJamesWoods I‚Äôm not an anti-Trump troll.  It‚Äôs just that there‚Äôs an overwhelming amount of scandals surrounding trump. I don‚Äôt see how he can survive. Too many people determined to end his presidency. These problems won‚Äôt just go away.
@DebraKellogg5 @ahanna0402 @pambridgetoday @RealJamesWoods The walls are closing in rapidly from many directions. He‚Äôs imploding and it‚Äôs just a matter of time before it‚Äôs all over. Blue wave. How you can‚Äôt see that, I‚Äôll never know.  You may love him, but his days as POTUS are numbered and that‚Äôs not a wish, it‚Äôs a reality based on fact
@ahanna0402 @pambridgetoday @RealJamesWoods How can you honestly believe that as every day there is worse and worse news.  Many supporters turning on him over omnibus and Wall. Even people like Laura Ingram, ann Coulter and Limbaugh. He‚Äôs doomed.  Stormy, Gloria Allred, Mueller and so many other problems coming for him.

@janeosanders Oh come on , give her a break. She‚Äôs not a politician or a candidate. It‚Äôs not a crime to make that mistake.
@ryanstruyk Wait , is this a joke?
@pambridgetoday @RealJamesWoods Impeachment or resignation will come soon enough. If you think otherwise then your truly deluded. Walls are closing in on him from all directions. He‚Äôs so busy defending himself that he has no time to be president. Can‚Äôt get out of his own way. Total chaos under this admin.
@pambridgetoday @RealJamesWoods LOLOLOL Mexico will never pay. Keep dreaming
@JoyAnnReid The story is that he shouldn‚Äôt need someone to tell him not to do that. He should have the sense to just know it on his own.
@JP_shirley @lineofhope @KyleKashuv You should just block me, rather than moving to suppress free speech. Or mute the conversation. Twitter is a place to express opinions, no matter how severely we disagree.
@UndeadDan @KyleKashuv @Wendy @DLoesch Overall violence may be trending down but certainly not the mass shootings. Let‚Äôs me real. This is what the debate is all about.
@UndeadDan @KyleKashuv @DLoesch I could not disagree with you more. The only positive takeaway is that we‚Äôre allowed to have and express differing points of view. Dana Loesch is anything but ‚Äúnot dangerous in any way‚Äù. She‚Äôs extremely dangerous and toxic. I know America will take the opportunity to enact reform
@UndeadDan @KyleKashuv @Wendy I hope that you‚Äôre right and I‚Äôm wrong. As trump says to virtually everything, we‚Äôll see what happens.
@UndeadDan @KyleKashuv Kyle is attacking his classmates, media &amp; people on the left. Sounds like tribalism to me. I don‚Äôt have time to do a full audit of his twitter feed. However, that‚Äôs my opinion , obviously not shared by many. In a democracy we are allowed to have differing opinions. Good day to u.
@Banned_Ali @josephwford @CurbApplFxrs @KyleKashuv The pie chart would overwhelmingly show that assault style weapons were used - sandy hook, san bernardino, pulse night club, etc. It‚Äôs intellectually dishonest to dismiss my point of view based on one example like Virginia tech. You all are entitled to your opinions.
@Banned_Ali @josephwford @CurbApplFxrs @KyleKashuv You can cherry pick an example like Virginia tech. But I‚Äôm talking about the recent mass shootings in schools, churches, etc., and I‚Äôm sure you know that. The majority of these national tragedies were committed with AR-15s and the like. Do a pie chart with JUST those occurrences.
@UndeadDan @KyleKashuv @Wendy I wish him well and will ‚Äústay tuned‚Äù. One of Kyle‚Äôs favorite retweets in Dana Loesch. Some day she will go down in history as the mouthpiece for one of history‚Äôs most dangerous organizations. One that ushered in and encouraged violence on a scale never seen before. Pray for USA
@UndeadDan @KyleKashuv @Wendy I don‚Äôt have time to get into a pointless twitter debate. I hope Kyle proves me wrong &amp; I admire these kids for staying strong &amp; voicing their opinions. I don‚Äôt agree with kyle‚Äôs opinions &amp; my perception is that he‚Äôs in the early stages of becoming the face of a dangerous movemnt
@UndeadDan @KyleKashuv https://t.co/32zR1MYsOH. Kyle retweets this guy, who retweets mike cernovich. Kyle is in the alt-right camp. We‚Äôll have to agree to disagree on how a kid in kyle‚Äôs position should best comport himself on social media. I wish him well but personally have written him off as helpful
@UndeadDan @KyleKashuv https://t.co/U9PoaiJTWh.  Exhibit A of troll- like behavior
@DrHamishFlange @SheriffClarke Get a dictionary, it‚Äôs a word
@UndeadDan @CurbApplFxrs @KyleKashuv Suggest you read further into his twitter feed. He‚Äôs one step away from pushing out infowars nonsense. I wish him well and feel sad to see a seemingly nice young man fall into the trumpish way of thinking.  Many who are strongly for gun reform are doing it for the kids.
@ananavarro Sorry for your loss. Thank you for sharing üíî
@NBCNews That‚Äôs where we are headed. Smh
@DrDenaGrayson @TeaPainUSA Glorious!!  Hallelujah!!!
@Banned_Ali @CurbApplFxrs @KyleKashuv Sorry but I have no more patience for these discussions.  I‚Äôll simply never agree and feel that children being murdered in school is a call to action. https://t.co/DjRnGUErzc
@Banned_Ali @CurbApplFxrs @KyleKashuv You are discrediting my entire point because a small (and not important) aspect may be incorrect in some respect. Please move on, there is no common ground here.
@Banned_Ali @CurbApplFxrs @KyleKashuv Give me a break. Vegas couldn‚Äôt happen with a handgun. Research is not needed. Basic concepts. Enjoy your anarchy and unchecked violence #NeverAgain.
@Banned_Ali @CurbApplFxrs @KyleKashuv You don‚Äôt need to be a gun expert to understand the difference in rounds per minute, the concept of reloading (or not), higher precision of sophisticated weapons, and the lethality of the bullets. It‚Äôs not complicated. At any rate, we clearly see the issue differently.
@Banned_Ali @CurbApplFxrs @KyleKashuv Why = to reduce the number of murders. So that it takes longer for the madman to kill everyone. #basicnotcomplicated
@Banned_Ali @CurbApplFxrs @KyleKashuv You may be factually correct, but I was illustrating a simple and valid point. #Strawman
@Banned_Ali @CurbApplFxrs @KyleKashuv Obviously I‚Äôm not a gun expert. I don‚Äôt know why you are asking these questions. Not random at all. Ban the sophisticated weapons of war, not the traditional kind where you have to reload and the bullets come out more slowly and less lethally. Its a pretty simple concept.
@Banned_Ali @CurbApplFxrs @KyleKashuv If there are no lines , total anarchy?  Why have laws at all?  Arm the children, even babies?  Put nuclear or nerve agents on the bullets?
@Banned_Ali @CurbApplFxrs @KyleKashuv Hello? Drawing the line on the speed and lethality of the bullets shooting out of the gun. Point is there are LIMITS on constitutional rights. Freedom of speech is limited - can‚Äôt scream fire in a theatre unless actual fire. Doing so brings harm to citizens. Do you have ANY line?
@wedwingwon Nah I think you and I just define evil differently
@Banned_Ali @CurbApplFxrs @KyleKashuv Like I said, fine with traditional handguns and shotguns. This is all about churches, theatres, schools and other public places getting shot Up. Hundreds can die in instants. Where is your humanity?  We have to draw the line somewhere on this. Like don‚Äôt scream fire in a theatre
@Alysson Lol good one wish I could witness that
@Banned_Ali @CurbApplFxrs @KyleKashuv You‚Äôre conflating two things. Read prior tweet.
@Banned_Ali @CurbApplFxrs @KyleKashuv Because of the amount of destruction that can be done in a very short amount of time. THAT‚ÄôS THE WHOLE FREAKING POINT of the debate!!!!  you wouldn‚Äôt have the Las Vegas massacre if all he had was a handgun.  Your precious AR-15 is a far more lethal killing machine.
@wedwingwon Not medicine shaming by any means. Point is you seem unbalanced and have overreacted, in my opinion. I may find your views and behaviors abhorrent, but I don‚Äôt deem you to be ‚Äúthe face of evil‚Äù. Seriously, troll someone who deserves it, an actual evil person like the kkk
@Banned_Ali @CurbApplFxrs @KyleKashuv Call it whatever the hell you want I lump them all together:  machine gun, AR-15, assault rifle , military grade weapon, blah blah blah. I‚Äôm fine with regular handguns and shotguns. NOT weapons of war!!  You guys really live in a weird and violent alternative universe. üî´üî´üí£‚õè
@gallifreyan @stevetallent @CurbApplFxrs @KyleKashuv We‚Äôll have to agree to disagree. We see the kids and the world quite differently. Simple ax that.
@wedwingwon Dude, get back on your meds. Not sure you have a good grasp of ‚Äúevil‚Äù. Put your energy into trolling someone who truly is evil like a pedophile or rapist.
@gallifreyan @stevetallent @CurbApplFxrs @KyleKashuv In my view, are divisive and bad for America (such as Fox News). Emma, David and others are fighting for gun reform and working with adults who are more reasonable and in the middle of the political spectrum.  It‚Äôs apples and oranges.  It‚Äôs american to protest and act for change
@gallifreyan @stevetallent @CurbApplFxrs @KyleKashuv Look, clearly the students are all having different reactions, as you‚Äôd expect. Kyle started out being pro-gun but reasonable and decent. As things heated up, he began being a troll and attacking people/groups with comments and retweets. He‚Äôs aligned himself with people who,
@wedwingwon Lol I think you are being a tad dramatic. We disagree on gun control - so I‚Äôm the face of evil?  Your ability to assess who is evil may need some fine-tuning. Have a beautiful day!  ‚ù§Ô∏èüê∂ü§óüíêüåà
@DeplorityReport @KyleKashuv @CNN Kyle was being sarcastic and retweeting a negative story about CNN.
@wokeluisa Love her so so much üò¢
@wokeluisa I generally agree but there are tons of decent evangelicals. They aren‚Äôt ALL horrible. Let‚Äôs give them a break (the ones who aren‚Äôt total hypocrites and fake Christians).
@tonyposnanski #DeplorableHumorSucks
@ChuckKersey1 @KyleKashuv Oy vey, suggest you re-take freshman English. I don‚Äôt want to take away rights. YOU said *I* don‚Äôt have the right to ‚Äúrun my fascist mouth‚Äù.  I was telling you the constitution guarantees my right to run my mouth. Got it?
@LisaDHart @KyleKashuv @williamlegate Could not agree more. Finally a voice of reason. Watch out for the trolls on this subject
@ChuckKersey1 @KyleKashuv Are you familiar with the first amendment?  Ever heard of it ?
@CurbApplFxrs @KyleKashuv I respect your right to express your opinions , blah blah blah. This discussion is going in circles. Best of luck with real estate and trolling. #done
@CurbApplFxrs @KyleKashuv (((( Sigh )))). You‚Äôre missing the whole point. That‚Äôs his future IF he decides to continue down the divisive path he‚Äôs currently on. You don‚Äôt seem to understand the difference between actual hatefulness and a hypothetical scenario. Clearly we are not on the same page. #adios
@CurbApplFxrs @lineofhope @KyleKashuv No, you‚Äôre not hateful at all!!  You clearly respect my right to express my opinions.   #whatever #ImpeachTrump #NeverAgain #Getbacktowork
@CurbApplFxrs @KyleKashuv That is an example of me saying what is in store for this young man if he makes foolish choices about who his friends and enemies are. Am i hateful if I say nazis are bad?  No.  Your arguments are childish and tiresome. Go back to real estate and talking about the good old days.
@USATODAY Getting rid of fb tonight. Good riddance
@treasonstickers So so true. Lol
@CurbApplFxrs @KyleKashuv Is this an example of that?	#Hypocrite #InDenial https://t.co/lvbZuOI85E
@CurbApplFxrs @KyleKashuv Your comments and retweets reveal a lot about you, OBVIOUSLY. also, you‚Äôre crazy to mix your politics and your  business into one twitter profile. You may find a negative impact as a result of how you publicly engage with strangers.
@CurbApplFxrs @KyleKashuv My point is you were being hypocritical and your thinking is backwards. Whataboutism is the currency of the Trump movement. Enjoy your guns and racism. Have a nice day!  üåà‚ù§Ô∏èü§óüê∂üíê
@KyleKashuv @MDAnderson314 *has, young man
@CurbApplFxrs @lineofhope @KyleKashuv I am not hateful; I am a thoughtful observer of those who are. I was lamenting the fact that young adults are so easily pulled into the world of hate by trump followers. That doesn‚Äôt make ME hateful.
@CurbApplFxrs @KyleKashuv Please give this advice to Dana Loesch and all the trolls at Fox.
@CurbApplFxrs @KyleKashuv They speak passionately because 17 classmates were brutally hunted down and murdered. Because it‚Äôs easy for anyone to get a machine gun that only military should have. The issues warrant tough talk. What‚Äôs coming from Kyle is completely different. Have a heart, have a soul.
@Brasilmagic Love it!
@cobracommandr15 @KyleKashuv We really have become two Americas, and trump ushered that in. Enjoy your guns. I weep for kids like Kyle who could have grown up to do great things  and make America proud. But he‚Äôs lost to the world of trolls, bullies, hateful NRA supporters and the ignorant among us.
@lineofhope @KyleKashuv You battle for sick children in need but yet you support the possession of AR-15s by teenagers?  Line of hope across America you have a very complex view of the world.
@lineofhope @KyleKashuv He‚Äôll be fine if he‚Äôs happy and content going to kkk rallies, NRA hatefests, reading Breitbart/daily stormer,  cocktail parties with Richard spencer.  I feel for him but he‚Äôs too far gone to realize what he‚Äôs signed up for. Good luck finding a nice sweet woman.Tomi laren maybe üòà
@luluontheshoe @KyleKashuv This kid‚Äôs got a bad case of trumpism.
@orussianbot @KyleKashuv @CNN @davidhogg111 Your responses are so well thought out and impactful. I really admire you for deep thinking, taking into account all sides of an issue and testing different theories . Your intellectual curiosity and openness to new ideas is really impressive. You‚Äôll go far in life!
@KyleKashuv Kyle you‚Äôve learned quickly how to divide people and create hatred of the other side. You are already a lost cause. Forget about winning any medals of honor unless they come from evil right-wing nutjobs like Dana Loesch . You blew it. You‚Äôll regret this big time.  Sad, so young
@orussianbot @KyleKashuv @CNN @davidhogg111 Ok make light of children being hunted down and murdered at school.  Have a great day !  üåà‚ù§Ô∏èüê∂ü§óüå∑üåõ
@realDonaldTrump If dersh had any credibility I might give this some though. Dersh is in the tank for trump. They‚Äôve got kompromot on Dersh. He‚Äôs thrown away his reputation completely. Resigned to the historical dustbin of hard right whackjobs. Sad.
RT @Freeyourmindkid: Retweet to remind the world that this is the face of American terrorism. https://t.co/CbaPCGMdz5
@orussianbot @KyleKashuv @CNN @davidhogg111 You‚Äôre not a puppet and a pawn if you started the movement and agree with its positions. This is driven by the kids because the adults are incapable and used to status quo.  David is very bright and passionately believes in what he‚Äôs doing. No hidden agenda at all.
@burritobritoboy @KyleKashuv @CNN If the bad guy has a killing machine and the good guy takes too long to get there, then you‚Äôve lost dozens in the meantime. Margin for error just too big. Having these weapons of war is just senseless. What happens when we put Nukes on AR-15s?  You have to draw the line somewhere
@burritobritoboy @KyleKashuv @CNN Agree to disagree. You can get all technical about it; I‚Äôm not familiar with any of that. What I know is that it‚Äôs far too easy for anyone of any age to get a killing machine and go shoot up a school , church or movie theatre. Yes good guy with gun works sometimes, but
@orussianbot @KyleKashuv @CNN @davidhogg111 Why is David Hogg so adored by millions????  It‚Äôs because America agrees with the stance he‚Äôs taking and we admire his bravery. He saw 17 classmates brutally murdered and said this is not ok. Fighting for them and all students. Hero!  Full stop.
@OhReally22 @KyleKashuv @CNN The company u keep matters, words matter. It tells the world what you‚Äôre all about. These people are universally reviled by all but a few hard right nut jobs. U r young and deserve a bright future. Don‚Äôt make decisions now that will determine that future for you. Wait til older.
@OhReally22 @KyleKashuv @CNN Sounds horrible to me. He‚Äôs got a chance to change the course of his life right now. Doing nothing is better than being a troll. Or simply stating you are pro NRA is better than attacking good people and institutions with different viewpoints. He‚Äôs got the trump bully virus now.
@OhReally22 @KyleKashuv @CNN I‚Äôd call people like trump, Loesch, palin, gorka, O‚ÄôReilly, ingraham, hannity bullies, wouldn‚Äôt you?  I really hope this kid doesn‚Äôt decide to follow in the footsteps of trolls like Donald trump junior and JACOB Wohl. He‚Äôll be doomed to a miserable life surrounded by trolls.
@orussianbot @KyleKashuv @CNN @davidhogg111 David will be just fine. He‚Äôs a young hero in the fight against the NRA. his future is very bright.
@burritobritoboy @KyleKashuv @CNN No one is trying to outlaw guns. It‚Äôs about military style assault weapons. Have your handguns and shotguns. But not machine guns or whatever you call them. The NRA is severely distorting how Americans really feel on the issues. It‚Äôs all about profits for gun manufacturers
@KyleKashuv @CNN Think about how your 17 classmates were brutally hunted like animals &amp; slaughtered right there in your school. Is owning an AR15 really more important than preventing another slaughter? If yes, you‚Äôve been terribly brainwashed &amp; u r the problem. These were REAL KIDS like u.
@KyleKashuv @CNN As you grow up and move away from the bad influences in your life, I hope you will realize that there are some toxic and dangerous people out there. They are hurting America. Aligning with them dooms you to a closed off, limited, toxic and unhappy life. Be better and be happy
@KyleKashuv @CNN This will affect people all around you. Many girls you meet in college will straight up hate u because of how u comport yourself now. You‚Äôll be forever lumped in with people like Dana Loesch,Richard spencer, gorka, ann Coulter and the like.  Your social media will hurt your life
@KyleKashuv @CNN Hey kid, you started off being smart and innocuous. But now you are aligning yourself with some scary folks.  You might rethink what you‚Äôre doing. The choices you make today will affect the rest of your life. You will be ostracized by your classmates and members of your community

@LibsHateFreedom @DetroitTha313 @WalshFreedom @SteveScalise It‚Äôs true. Do some research on Scalia being buddy buddy with anti-LGBT groups.
@Pajjr2016 Can‚Äôt wait!
@PhilippeReines And what makes everything even worse is all the Trump idiots who, TO THIS DAY, were so duped that even when shown they were duped STILL believe what they were told about Crooked Hillary. The stupidity of Americans has no limit. Sad.
In addition, he is so divisive that it exacerbates his ineffectiveness. It‚Äôs unprecedented to see how many people simply refuse to attend events if he will be there (Lincoln Center, Sacramento Kings, olympians, etc).  He is not respected or admired.
Trump spends at least HALF his time dealing with Trump/Russia, Stormy, sexual harassment claims &amp; family issues. It doesn‚Äôt leave much time for him to focus on actually being @POTUS and doing his job. He should be removed on the grounds that he‚Äôs unable to be effective on the job
@Marius_W_M @Zomby2D @TghActnTinactin @JimCarrey His point is she‚Äôs not behaving the way the Christian faith directs it‚Äôs followers to behave.

@GicAriana @JunckerEU @KremlinRussia_E @EU_Commission @RusMission_EU And they are brazenly murdering people all over the world. Trump seems to have no clue that it‚Äôs NOT ok to congratulate Putin. Totally clueless. Perhaps a proper Secretary of State could advise him on these matters.

@Brooke_Babineau @ChrisButIer1 @SteveScalise Yeah, we‚Äôll put you in a photo op and give you a stupid plaque, but we‚Äôll still work against your kind and strip you of human rights. Hilary had it right - the party of DEPLORABLES !
@nypmetro The word lesbian was just used as click bait. The quotes and story have virtually nothing to do with the sexual orientation of either candidate.
@VoteMarsha Not even if all the other candidates were zombies
@funder Basically it all comes back to racism/ islamaphobia and profits for gun manufacturers.
@SteveScalise And yet you do nothing about serious gun control. Blood on your hands. You of all people .....
@realDonaldTrump What does this mean - our farmers always lead the way?  I don‚Äôt get it. I don‚Äôt feel that any farmers are leading me in any way. That‚Äôs a dumb comment that you made because it is agriculture week. I applaud them for growing food but not for leading us.

@PhilippeReines @TheCentipede2 See there you go revealing your true nature. You actually enjoy bringing pain to others (those who disagree with you politically).  Isn‚Äôt it a little extreme to say rot in hell?  After all that junior has said and done (very toxic), no one feels too sorry for him. #karma
@PhilippeReines @mike55michigan You tell him Philippe!!  I love when MAGAt nonsense is called out by a political veteran who knows what he‚Äôs talking about.
The real question is - what on earth did Aubrey O‚ÄôDay see in DJTJR?  It is hard to imagine her being attracted to him. He did learn from his dad and must‚Äôve felt infidelity was OK. another fake Christian.
@Marius_W_M @TghActnTinactin @JimCarrey It‚Äôs not her religion he‚Äôs attacking. It‚Äôs the HYPOCRISY; her faith preaches honesty and the Ten Commandments or whatever, but she lies for trump daily, a man who , to this day, does not live a good, clean Christian life!  And she‚Äôs sanctimonious about it too.
@funder @realDonaldTrump Stormy and her lawyer are my heroes!!!  I want all the NDA girls to speak up!  Our country needs this so badly.
@JordanUhl Especially the evangelicals. The height of hypocrisy. Baffling
@andylassner She is like the meanest mean girl in high school. Pretty but so so hateful and ugly on the inside. Perfect for Fox. I‚Äôve never seen her act gentle and nice, ever. What happened to her as a child? Raised by kkk??
@Evan_Rosenfeld @CKozalBrennan @PPVSRB Good. Please also probe why Vance didn‚Äôt indict the Trumps over Trump SoHo. He‚Äôs on the take. Also mishandled the Chinese bank on Atticus.

@Skonialo @BiglyPrez @SheriffClarke She blocked me, yay!!!
@Skonialo @BiglyPrez @SheriffClarke If you elevate the discourse you may have better luck at helping others to understand your POV.  You might change some minds. But maybe you enjoy the disparagement more than seeing progress.
@Skonialo @BiglyPrez @SheriffClarke Just curious. Does tossing in an ad hominem attack make u feel better? It degrades &amp; detracts from any intellectual point u may be trying to make. People can disagree without being disagreeable. I didn‚Äôt attack u. I pointed out many faces of the GOP are national embarrassment
@Skonialo @BiglyPrez @SheriffClarke Seriously, are you proud that the leaders of your party are people like Clark, palin, Gorka, Bannon, arpaio and the like?  I‚Äôd be so embarrassed I‚Äôd have to become an independent.

@MlforTrump @AndyThorburnCA @RealBenCarson Don‚Äôt you know trump‚Äôs tax cut is projected to add over a trillion to the deficit?  That means more debt. Obama had an excuse for what he needed to do - mortgage industry collapse , bailing out banks, auto industry, etc.
@MlforTrump @MrsVanessaTrump @SecretService Please get Help.  You need it. The world is not as black and white as you think it is. If there is a god, he/she is not a member of a political party. He/she loves all humans.
@MlforTrump @MrsVanessaTrump @SecretService You REALLY think liberals will burn in hell simply because they subscribe to a different political ideology?  You are overthinking this, and reducing people to nothing more than political party. U might want to rethink this. To say you are overreacting is an understatement.
@MlforTrump @MrsVanessaTrump @SecretService How can you say such evil things without knowing anything about a person other than who they voted for?  Seriously, get back on your meds.
@MlforTrump @MrsVanessaTrump @SecretService Dude , you have issues. Seek help, STAT
@AdamParkhomenko @RepSwalwell The Democrats should then open an investigation into why the GOP, especially the House Intel Committee, did nothing !!!
@wcoolbreeze You‚Äôre ignoring the fact that millions of Americans (millions of trump voters ) are not independently wealthy. They do and will need a safety net. You don‚Äôt seem to care. If you are fine with them suffering then you are getting what you want under trump.
@wcoolbreeze Again with the whataboutism. You are brainwashed. There was no need to give billionaire donors and other wealthy people 60% of the tax cuts. Adding trillions to the deficit that future generations to pay. Agree to disagree.
@wcoolbreeze Lucky you. The vast majority of trump voters do need those entitlement programs. Do you care about them?  Or just you?
@wcoolbreeze This is classic ‚Äúwhataboutism‚Äù and in no way diminishes the problems with your party, the one in power. Take a look at YOUR party.
@doppelgosling @marcorubio @FIU He‚Äôll send thoughts and prayers , as per usual (nothing else)
@wcoolbreeze These are probably good things in your book, which is why we‚Äôve devolved in to two Americas. Enjoy your racism and have fun when you find there is no social security and Medicare when you need them. At least you‚Äôll still have your AR-15s!  Enjoy!
@wcoolbreeze Where do you get your info? Fox News, infowars, Breitbart and daily stormer?  You have ZERO credibility if this is the case.
@wcoolbreeze Racism, misogyny, homophobia, wealth inequality, environmental destruction, sexism, corruption, ignorance, international trade wars, stupidity, unabashed greed, mistreatment of ADLs, bullies, hypocrites, anti-semites, NRA, billionaire donors, etc., etc. Got the picture now?
@wcoolbreeze 90% of twitter is people pushing out theories and opinions. It‚Äôs how modern societies evolve and advance. We question and analyze things. You are a very rude person. It‚Äôs your kind of toxic nature that is dividing our country. Michelle Obama‚Äôs point is apt. Trump era reveals much
@wcoolbreeze Read it again....it says I THINK. It‚Äôs a theory, and I think a very logical one.
@SenatorCollins @AARP Good grief the ratio on this is unreal!!!  Not one single positive comment!  #SelloutSusanCollins
@MlforTrump @MrsVanessaTrump @SecretService You‚Äôre an idiot if you support Trump in the face of all his lies and stupid, narcissistic and reckless mistakes. You‚Äôre also brainwashed and acting against your own self-interests.
@wcoolbreeze Why is my suspicion implausible and dumb to you?  How would you know?
@SapperMakeBoom @LouDobbs @realDonaldTrump  https://t.co/6giiDAhCfM
@Mikel_Jollett @PaulBegala Bravo to whoever put that together. Fox News is dangerous and a major factor in the downfall of America. I think Trumpism really started with Palin.  That‚Äôs when we really saw the combination of dumb+dangerous +oblivious+toxic. Dunning -Kruger effect all day Long.
Trump claimed the pee pee tape couldn‚Äôt exist because he‚Äôs a germaphobe. However, we now know he‚Äôs had many extramarital affairs and one with a porn star. I think having relations with a porn star negates the germaphobe excuse. (No offense to stormy is intended)
@luckyferals I watch every night. Helps me relax. Thanks to you and the kitties!  üò∫üòª
@Stephademic @StormyDaniels So true!  Well said!
@StormyDaniels @ThePerezHilton Love you Stormy.....keep it up!
@metaquest .....and in turn it is creating many future generations of Trumpians. The virus will be with us for decades, infecting what used to be great.
@EricBoehlert I‚Äôll take it, in this case, I guess. Whatever it takes.
@tonyposnanski Why don‚Äôt you just mute the conversation?
@RTMannJr @DLeonhardt I certainly hope tillerson, Cohn, McMaster will at least speak up and tell the world how dangerous trump is.
@RileySnyder Madness.  What a horrible time to be alive in America
@latimes Beautiful piece. Sorry for your loss.  Thank you for sharing.
@LouDobbs @realDonaldTrump How does it feel to know most of your followers are bots and drooling MAGA idiots?
@ParkerMolloy This is wonderful. Would be even better if the text didn‚Äôt cover up their faces. Thanks
@TheRynheart @realDonaldTrump @WhiteHouse Ultimately high rates slow down growth and this can dampen stock market on a longer-term basis. Investors won‚Äôt have the same confidence level.  Either way we don‚Äôt want Chinese sell and stop buying us treasuries.
@TheRynheart @realDonaldTrump @WhiteHouse I was with you until your last sentence.  If the Chinese bail on US Treasuries, the price drops and rates go up (inverse relationship). But the money that leaves treasuries would go to equities, which drives up stock market. But then maybe you are saying high rates=no growth.
@wokeluisa @InSpiteOfTrump  https://t.co/jJitWrky1e
@wokeluisa @InSpiteOfTrump It‚Äôs possible she got really freaked out by the white powder. Combined with him never being home. God can you imagine being married to that dude?  Nightmare
@chrislhayes @InSpiteOfTrump @murphy2u I have it too. Most people don‚Äôt notice. No bigger. You do a great job
Michelle Obama‚Äôs famous quote applies perfectly to Vanessa Trump‚Äôs marriage:  ‚ÄúThe presidency doesn‚Äôt change who you are; it REVEALS who you are.‚Äù  I think Vanessa didn‚Äôt know who she married until his ugly side came out due to politics. Realized he‚Äôs a monster.
@THR @Scaramucci Thanks for the laughs LOLOLOLOLOLOL    Get over yourself Mooch. üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
@brandcoachkelly @suzymoffitt @marcorubio @RepJNunez Thoughts and prayers ... to the daylight
@Cycle4 @PotterShammi @samstein That , but if she is no longer the wife she CAN testify against him. So it‚Äôs a wash (?)
@JonBershad Same. Fair is fair. We knew not what we didn‚Äôt know at the time.
@newsysuzy @KathleenSKelley @Lin_Manuel I think there would be a ton of interest if it did another Broadway run. Please @Lin_Manuel !!!
@MrsVanessaTrump @SecretService Congratulations on the divorce filing!  Can‚Äôt wait to read your book. You‚Äôve completed the first step in separating from that evil family. There‚Äôs hope for you.
@KathleenSKelley @Lin_Manuel Omg what I wouldn‚Äôt give to see that!  Sounds amazing. Thank you so much for taking the time to explain. It is greatly appreciated. Anthony will be just amazing as Usnavi, as will Vanessa. I see Morgan K in some rehearsal videos also (from Hamilton ensemble ). Thanks!
@Lin_Manuel Can someone please let me know what‚Äôs going on?  Is In the Heights in rehearsal somewhere?  Lin is there?  Who‚Äôs playing who?  Need to know !!  Thanks üòç
@Lin_Manuel Omg I‚Äôm dying!  üòçüòç
@thehill @SLSmith000 Of course they did. We‚Äôre all doomed. üî´
@jonfavs Also said ‚ÄúLamb the Sham‚Äù. What a d$ck.
@WalshFreedom Honestly it‚Äôs too late. Republicans can‚Äôt stop the powerful blue wave. They deserve what‚Äôs in store for them this year. But it‚Äôs ok because we will all win when trump is gone.
@muumi_tweets @Tefech46 @brianklaas Over a very short period of time....
@SenBobCorker @senorrinhatch @SenAlexander You‚Äôd better do your job when it comes to confirming (or not) Pompeo as SOS. if you don‚Äôt ask about Russia and trump you will be revealed as the traitor you surely are. #CorkerKickback
@isteintraum What‚Äôs the bfd?  I‚Äôm clumsy and fall or trip every once in a while. They relish any opportunity to attack her. It‚Äôs a sad time to be an American.
@StephenCalk Can‚Äôt wait to hear more about your part in Trump Russia. That‚Äôll be a great day!
@MJGerson Terrific article, explains a lot. Sad.  You did a great job helping a liberal Democrat atheist understand what the heck is going on.
@kylegriffin1 The term keystone cops (partisan, corrupt ones) comes to mind.  Mueller is our best hope.
@walterowensgrpa @kylegriffin1 Not her place?  She‚Äôs the top Democrat in the House!  Of course she should express an opinion. This committee was like keystone cops but still should not have been shut down.
@trish_regan Even many of trump‚Äôs guys disagree with the tariffs. See Stephen Moore. You are in denial if you think the tarrifs are popular among the GOP.
@trish_regan I think I‚Äôll believe the world‚Äôs top economists, not a pretty face on Fox (trump mouthpiece).
@KCamenga @TGowdySC Like what?  I can‚Äôt find one good thing he‚Äôs done. Basically just wasted taxpayer dollars for years. Good riddance
@TGowdySC If you link to the Daily Caller, you instantly lose all credibility
@Malonlabe33 @TGowdySC Are you insane?
@LawyerRogelio I don‚Äôt get why he calls him sleepy-eyed?  I love chuck Todd. He‚Äôs energetic and highly engaged.
@StarterScript @calvinstowell He seems to be handling Stormy differently from others. Presumably due to money trail and ‚Äúpaternity issues‚Äù. I agree there are more important topics regarding trump but I think Americans should know who he is (liar, not pro-life, etc). We can multitask!!
@StarterScript @calvinstowell How do you square that with the fact that evangelicals look the other way on everything due to pro-life Gorsuch?  It seems to me that this (abortion revelations/Stormy) could possibly be a bridge too far for the evangelicals. As trump says on most things, we‚Äôll see what happens.
@lagibbs84 @ThumperIndy @PressSec I‚Äôm outraged that Lauren allowed herself to be a prop in a trump photo op but in fairness to her, she seems like a decent person otherwise (unlike deplorable sanders and trumps ). I‚Äôm glad to see Lauren focusing on sports and staying out of political stuff lately. Was a bad look.
@StarterScript @calvinstowell I think the story will become much more important if it is discovered that trump encouraged Stormy to have an abortion. That is the rumor. It‚Äôs a potential game-changer. And yes there are a million other reasons and ways he goes down.
@MichaelSteele Hey @MichaelSteele - did the whole CPAC thing just blow over?  I was very outraged for you, and I say that as a Democrat. No story, no matter how atrocious, gets oxygen anymore. If you stand by folks like that after those word about you, you‚Äôll lose credibility yourself. Don‚Äôt !!
@marcorubio @POTUS @realDonaldTrump When is Rubio‚Äôs term up?  I can‚Äôt wait to see him tossed out of the senate. I wonder what he thinks reading all these negative comments. Probably doesn‚Äôt bother reading them.
@freelanceginger @TGSRPM She had no response when you said we deserve a decent man as president AND a tax cut. Hilarious. Great line from you. He‚Äôs disgusting!!!
@freelanceginger @TGSRPM Great job on Laura ingraham‚Äôs show. She‚Äôs nasty and all of her answers are ‚Äúwhataboutism‚Äù.  She pretends to not understand feminism. Laura is just toxic.  I agree - disgusting!  Laura is Rude to invited guests.
@julissaarce @danpfeiffer @PodSaveAmerica @MsPackyetti @jonfavs @TVietor08 @crookedmedia Yay. Where‚Äôs Lovett?
@camusr6 @Racheldoesstuff In addition to suggesting single people with cats are lonely losers, it also suggests our homes smell really bad!  Very disappointed. Had been a huge fan, musical theatre geek.
@DonaldJTrumpJr Like father, like son. Dotard, Jr doesn‚Äôt know how to punctuate ‚Äúenemies‚Äô feelings‚Äù.
@JessicaHuseman @svdate Maybe he meant like ‚Äúpurportedly ‚Äú a reporter?  He‚Äôs a jackass regardless.
@GOPChairwoman Please tell us all about this real change. I think these are just empty words, mere talking points.
@StormyDaniels You‚Äôre a hero Stormy. Thank you!  Many of us  are with you 100%. You may bring down the worst president in the history of America. You may save our country!!  We need you.
@thecjpearson Hmmm @thecjpearson seems to have gone silent on this topic. Sweetheart- why don‚Äôt you just admit you aren‚Äôt an expert on the 2nd amendment and constitutional law?  You seem like mostly a great kid. Too bad you are very misguided about Dear Leader.
@MichaelLuwoye @HamiltonMusical I saw you twice in LA-loved it, loved you!!!  Bravo Michael !!
@StarterScript @calvinstowell Um do we really want a president who succumbs to blackmail?  I think this is worth some oxygen.
@Kunfiadu @calvinstowell Absolutely!!
@calvinstowell @JustSchmeltzer And lying to everyone about the affair, with sanctimony (to quote Maggie haberman). The lie is worse than the affair.
@MichaelAvenatti @StormyDaniels @andersoncooper @60Minutes You are an American hero and so is Stormy!!  #ReleasetheSAR

@cadeplorable23 @NumbersMean @Karen_version_3 @LowerMyBills Decades from now, historians will study the downfall of America. They will find that a major cause of our downfall was the fact that no one believes what they read. They scream ‚Äúfake news‚Äù and simply believe what they want. Societies can‚Äôt function if all data is suspect.
@AJDelgado13 Your taste in lovers is as bad as your taste in presidents. Even after Jason and the trump camp treat you this way, you still support Trump?  Sad
@zojjauniquelyu @seekdivinetruth @jj20101 @eeoij @KyleKashuv @yashar @FLOTUS @POTUS @realDonaldTrump @KellyannePolls Many Americans are racists and nothing makes them happier than having a dog whistle president. Because they love having a racist/homophobic/misogynistic/anti-Semite president (like them), they give him a free pass on everything, including pointless photo ops that accomplish Nada.
@_dannybob_ @brianpabyrne And another year for supporting trump
@jaketapper @metaquest I get your point but I sure as hell wouldn‚Äôt dine with him!
@oldladydem @TheStagmania Totally. 100% agree
@seekdivinetruth @jj20101 @eeoij @KyleKashuv @yashar @FLOTUS @POTUS @realDonaldTrump @KellyannePolls @BarackObama Not to mention his sexual assault accusers!!  He‚Äôs got so many skeletons in his closet. If Kushner, junior and others get indicted I feel trump may resign. Really hoping for that!!!
@seekdivinetruth @jj20101 @eeoij @KyleKashuv @yashar @FLOTUS @POTUS @realDonaldTrump @KellyannePolls @BarackObama Totally. His presidency could end for MANY reasons.Scandals like Stormy Daniels, illegal campaign contributions, collusion w/ Russia, obstructing Justice (Comey), his own financial misdeeds (money laundering), and generally being divisive and ineffective. Drain the swamp my ass!
@seekdivinetruth @jj20101 @eeoij @KyleKashuv @yashar @FLOTUS @POTUS @realDonaldTrump @KellyannePolls Precisely. Nothing whatsoever got done. Cheap &amp; pointless photo op.  People are so gullible. Their racism blinds them about trump. Walls are closing in on him from many directions. Fun to watch!
@RealTimers @billmaher @kathygriffin @ananavarro @traecrowder @EWErickson @bariweiss @HBO Bari was great last time. EWErickson is a tool.
@cadeplorable23 @NumbersMean @Karen_version_3 @LowerMyBills Deplorables are just so rude. You have no idea who you are dialoguing with, yet more than happy to attack. Good people can have different ideologies and not attack. Entitlement cuts HURT the most vulnerable. U only care for U, not for ALL Americans. Unamerican, selfish.
@cadeplorable23 @NumbersMean @Karen_version_3 @LowerMyBills https://t.co/MlsCx4vOZx.  Whatever, Deplorable Ryan. You seem to know it all but I‚Äôd bet my very large 401k (thanks obama) that you‚Äôre dead wrong. Enjoy your massive deficit and cuts to Medicare.
@cadeplorable23 @NumbersMean @Karen_version_3 @LowerMyBills Of course I get that. He kept rates low long enough to ensure recovery then signaled gradual increases, which is beginning to happen.  With trump all bets are off and his volatility/short-sightedness can cause real damage to consumer and investor confidence.
@cadeplorable23 @NumbersMean @Karen_version_3 @LowerMyBills Keep feeding yourself those talking points, I hope you can sleep well at night. The stock market is in a bubble, it will adjust. Trade wars will cause job losses.  Rates are going up and so will inflation. Deficit adds are stupid. Entitlement cuts are coming. Avg American screwed
@cadeplorable23 @NumbersMean @Karen_version_3 @LowerMyBills You are out of touch. Millions of Americans are just making ends meet and don‚Äôt have retirement funds to speak of.
@cadeplorable23 @NumbersMean @Karen_version_3 @LowerMyBills Why do you think Gary Cohn quit?  They can all see the writing on the wall. The rats are jumping off the sinking ship. Sell your equities now!
@cadeplorable23 @NumbersMean @Karen_version_3 @LowerMyBills Obama had high stock market, low interest rates, low inflation and low unemployment. Steered us out of a recession and mortgage banking crisis. I‚Äôd say he did a great job. We r in a trump bubble. It will burst and be catastrophic.
@cadeplorable23 @NumbersMean @Karen_version_3 @LowerMyBills It‚Äôs a commonly cited fact. Average American does not benefit from rising stock market. Although trump would have you believe otherwise.
@cadeplorable23 @NumbersMean @Karen_version_3 @LowerMyBills Market is up due to lower Corp taxes. However, many say the corps are doing stock buybacks and dividends rather than growth. Many trump policies will cause market to decline.  Growth tempered by exploding deficit. Dismantling entitlements will hurt usa.  Just Wait &amp; see. Not good
@cadeplorable23 @NumbersMean @Karen_version_3 @LowerMyBills I love that he‚Äôs adding trillions to the deficit and starting trade wars. Just watch the stock market start to tank.  Most Americans don‚Äôt benefit from stock market anyway. Get ready for many job losses to come.  Good thing we cut billions in taxes for wealthy donors. LOL.
@Karen_version_3 @cadeplorable23 @LowerMyBills It worked out so well when Bush loosened up lending standards so that nearly everyone could purchase a home. Remember the mortgage industry meltdown, millions of foreclosures and bank bailouts?

However, I have zero confidence in Rubio solving anything.

@JoeNBC @marcorubio Agree but he is basically obligated to do so. They are his constituents.
@lagibbs84 @chi_picks @RickMartlnez @MarkDice Is it fair to say the photo and posting backfired?  Or is there some other conclusion to be drawn / lesson learned ?  Twitter sure is a nasty place but many of us feel we are fighting a war to save our country from its worst self. Things will get worse before better
@2018NVPolitics @lagibbs84 @BreitbartNews Oh but according to the White House, ivanka was in South Korea as a senior US official, NOT as his daughter!  LOL. she does not have proper clearance but still discussed sanctions against nuclear North Korea!!  The nepotism with the trumps is hugely unacceptable. #TrumpSoHoFraud
@JohnWDean After being attacked by MAGA trolls all day, it just feels SO good to read tweets from a smart man like you. One who sees through Trump‚Äôs manipulation of the masses. Thank you John, I really needed to see this tweet. Let this nightmare end soon! (Wishful thinking I know).
@RepMattGaetz @FoxFriendsFirst @FoxNews I can‚Äôt wait until you are voted out and someone decent takes your seat.
@mseant64 Suggest you take a good look at your own hateful twitter feed. I don‚Äôt want or need Dear Leader‚Äôs mercy. #Blocked. https://t.co/Rfq18Jpii6
@Rnewmanjr1 @jamin0 @MbksysB @lagibbs84 @TeamUSA @NBCOlympics @USABS @IvankaTrump Speaking up for your beliefs, against injustices, is not the same as trolling. I‚Äôve been very respectful towards Lauren. I‚Äôve stated my opinions in a rational manner. Normalizing the Trump admin takes us down a dangerous path. That‚Äôs what this is about. Your comments ARE hateful.
@Anth_Coney @MarkDice @britektire @lagibbs84 Do some research!  For starters, she defrauded investors in Trump SoHo!  Look it up. The trump kids lied about presales of the condos to get more investors. Came within an inch of indictment but their lawyer paid off the DA.  Seriously, look it up - many credible sources on this
@jamin0 @Rnewmanjr1 @MbksysB @lagibbs84 @TeamUSA @NBCOlympics @USABS @IvankaTrump I agree. Sure looks that way. They‚Äôve created new accounts post-purge and have just a few followers. Some even have Russian tweets early in their tweet histories!  What a world.
@Rnewmanjr1 @MbksysB @lagibbs84 @jamin0 @TeamUSA @NBCOlympics @USABS @IvankaTrump These facts are supported by documented actions on the part of the Trump admin. But keep your head in the sand. Ignorance is bliss. Have a good night.
@Rnewmanjr1 @MbksysB @lagibbs84 @jamin0 @TeamUSA @NBCOlympics @USABS @IvankaTrump I don‚Äôt want unity with what the GOP has become. It‚Äôs a fringey hate group now. We will vote them all out. It‚Äôs the party of infowars, Fox News and David duke now. #NoThanks
@Rnewmanjr1 @MbksysB @lagibbs84 @jamin0 @TeamUSA @NBCOlympics @USABS @IvankaTrump Can‚Äôt you guys read?  My comments are factual in nature, without a hateful tone. Facts:  trump admin IS racist, IS homophobic, IS full of wife beaters and assaulters, IS corrupt, etc. Why is it hateful to point these things out in a factual way?  You are just attacking.
@exavierpope @Nas Lauren should be commended for taking down the photo.
@CadetStrand @whoissizzle @BDHerren @mjbrezinski @macatackk111 @lagibbs84 @BoucherMC @afidla @TeamUSA @NBCOlympics @USABS @IvankaTrump @realDonaldTrump First off, he‚Äôs backed off on not selling guns to teenagers.

@mlancenewby @lagibbs84 @jamin0 @TeamUSA @NBCOlympics @USABS @IvankaTrump My comments are pretty tame. Not at all vile and hateful. Really just trying to explain to Lauren the impact of her seemingly harmless act. I believe the trump admin (not me) is racist, homophobic, misogynistic, oppressive, anti-semitic, bad for the environment. Why not speak up?
@fuggirls @yashar This made my whole month!
@kurteichenwald @davidhogg111 Truly deplorable
@StephenCalk How‚Äôs the divorce going?  Bet you are shaking in your boots. Shouldn‚Äôt have gotten tangled up with those crooks. Time to pay the piper.
@SymoneDSanders How do you have the strength to be around those guys
@pridenpassion @IvankaTrump @PressSec @lagibbs84 My heroes from the Olympics are @Adaripp and @lindseyvonn
@pridenpassion @IvankaTrump @PressSec @lagibbs84 Honestly, her wide platform makes it even more incumbent upon her to not normalize them. I‚Äôm not saying she needs to do an obnoxious protest or boycott but the selfie was indeed a tacit endorsement. Her choice, agree to disagree. This will All play out soon anyway (via Mueller)
@pridenpassion Well , you must be less outraged than I am about the Trump admin.  I think she had a choice about taking the photo and posting it . It was not simply part of the job. Normalizing them and being a prop is on the pathway to despotism. Agree to disagree. #noexcuses
@BoucherMC @lagibbs84 @afidla @TeamUSA @NBCOlympics @USABS @IvankaTrump You may be ok with the photo Lauren, but you‚Äôve got thousands of fans who have been mistreated and disrespected by the trumps. I think for their sake you should really think about what you say and do on social media. Great athlete, nice woman, but normalizing evil matters.
@lagibbs84 @afidla @TeamUSA @NBCOlympics @USABS @IvankaTrump The average person applauding you for that horrible photo wouldn‚Äôt dream of posing with obama or the clintons. Give me a break.
@lagibbs84 @Stay_Frosty2015 @MMortensenUSA @IvankaTrump @taylormorris91 They don‚Äôt deserve respect. That‚Äôs the whole point. A lot of people are happy/content and choose not to be outraged by what‚Äôs happening. They choose not to learn more about just why it is so bad. That‚Äôs fine for some. But for those of us very close to it, we would never be a prop
@lagibbs84 @CubTrader @Suzierosenberg @kenvogel @IvankaTrump I think a better policy for an athlete not wanting all this negative attention is to be apolitical. You think posing with her is helping to unify but it‚Äôs just not.
@afidla @lagibbs84 @hotincleveland @TeamUSA @NBCOlympics @USABS @IvankaTrump Well said Anna. Most people just don‚Äôt get it. I‚Äôm constantly shocked at how many people , particularly those who will suffer under trump, allow themselves to be used as props in photo ops
@lagibbs84 @pridenpassion Therefore, how can you tacitly endorse this admin?  You are normalizing them. You are making it seem like they are normal , well-meaning people. What they‚Äôre doing is completely unacceptable on many levels.
@lagibbs84 @rebcelan @1yetae Proud ???  Lauren please explain why you are proud to take that picture. The admin is vile on so many levels. Proud Just doesn‚Äôt apply. As a woman, a POC, non-1%, you need to learn more about them. Glad you took down the photo.
@StacyResists @HoarseWisperer And yet Mnuchin says she has proper clearances to discuss nk sanctions with South Korean leader. Insanity!!  Total fucking insanity and so so irresponsible. No one voted for ivanka to handle things way over her head.
@lagibbs84 @mjbrezinski @BoucherMC @afidla @TeamUSA @NBCOlympics @USABS @IvankaTrump Nah, just a prediction. I wish you luck,  but I‚Äôm truly saddened that you made that choice, and I do feel it will blowback on you.  I love the Olympics but they were tainted by Pence and ivanka. Agree to disagree.
@mjbrezinski @lagibbs84 @BoucherMC @afidla @TeamUSA @NBCOlympics @USABS @IvankaTrump Agree, she really blew it. She‚Äôll come to regret being ivanka‚Äôs prop in a photo op.
@mp5venom @jules_su @realDonaldTrump John Bostick- can you please elaborate on what is better for vets under Trump?  Very curious. Thank you.
@TheRickWilson Good grief. I have no more capacity for outrage. What have we become. Where are the adults?
@SabrinaCath Wake up- you are the party of HATE!!!  Racist, homophobic, anti-Semitic, anti-LGBT, misogynistic, and you love your instruments of death!  This is WHO YOU ARE!  if you don‚Äôt like it, leave the GOP and the NRA. We boycott the WH and stupid photo ops due to your hateful admin.
@Dee_Marketing @glennbeck So the kids and parkland community needed to vent. It was therapeutic for them. They are entitled. I applaud them. Enjoy your machine guns. Maher is way too good for you.
@Paullower1 @glennbeck Glenn Beck suggesting we need to find the middle is rich. He‚Äôs a monster and has played a tremendous role in creating the toxic environment of 2018. He‚Äôs as bad as Alex jones. Seriously, spare me your words of wisdom.
@SabrinaCath Would you smile and pose for a picture with obama, Hillary, Jesse Jackson, Michael Moore, Adam Schiff, Nancy pelosi, Bill Maher, etc?  Your party shouts ‚Äúlock her up!‚Äù  Turning us into a banana republic. So embarrassing. You‚Äôre in denial about the trumps. But you‚Äôll see.... soon.
@SabrinaCath I was asking the bobsledder where she draws the line. If she poses with ivanka, will she also pose with kkk members, blatant islamaphobes, and even someone as bad as hitler?  I was making a point, not comparing the athlete to hitler. Read more slowly for better comprehension.
@SabrinaCath You make a lot of assumptions there. How would you have any idea who I am and what I do?  Do you just assume all liberals are not worthy?  It‚Äôs that kind of knee-jerk thinking that makes Trumpsters such idiots.
@clfunez @KathleanConner @MilaceMcnair @Workhorse95 @klynnelaraway @GayMafia1969 @cameron_kasky @NRA So true!   I don‚Äôt hear that comment often enough
@clfunez @KathleanConner @klynnelaraway @GayMafia1969 @cameron_kasky @NRA I think she‚Äôs saying the media doesn‚Äôt cover inner city crime to the same extent, such as what‚Äôs happening in Chicago. It‚Äôs apples and oranges, but that‚Äôs her supporting detail for the assertion.
@TaraSetmayer @buzzzbea @my_good_karma @K_Law124 Great job as usual on CNN today. @Lonegan is a trump sycophant and refused to actually answer any questions. He just says NO COLLUSION!  where is the critical thinking?  Apparently does not care about Russian interference. What a patriot. Not a chance in hell he gets elected.
@yashar Totally agree on all counts. Love Seinfeld and Curb but Jerry‚Äôs standup not so much
@MikeofAmerica1 @BoucherMC @lagibbs84 @afidla @TeamUSA @NBCOlympics @USABS @IvankaTrump Don‚Äôt you understand that our country is in a crisis?  All bets are off now.
@lagibbs84 @TeamUSA @NBCOlympics @USABS @IvankaTrump Is there anyone you WOULDN‚ÄôT pose with?  David duke?  Hitler?  Laura Ingram?  Do you have actual standards?  For change to come people have to take a stand. I seriously can‚Äôt fathom why you‚Äôd fall for that.
@lagibbs84 @kimrc11 @TeamUSA @NBCOlympics @USABS @IvankaTrump They don‚Äôt care about you. It‚Äôs just a photo op. They are only concerned about the 1% and they are definitely tangled up with Russia. They are manipulating naive and racist Americans into thinking he is a populist savior. As an African American, u should be particularly reviled.
@lagibbs84 @kimrc11 @TeamUSA @NBCOlympics @USABS @IvankaTrump If you can see right from wrong, then how can you lower yourself and be a prop for them?  Seriously, what were you thinking?  I know you are a medal-winning Olympian and the world is all rainbows right now, but do the right thing and educate yourself on this Adminstration.
@lagibbs84 @jamin0 @TeamUSA @NBCOlympics @USABS @IvankaTrump You strike me as naive and probably have no idea just how racist and destructive this administration is. I hope you do some research and learn what‚Äôs up. If you knew, you would never be a prop for them. Smh
@lagibbs84 @BoucherMC @afidla @TeamUSA @NBCOlympics @USABS @IvankaTrump I wouldn‚Äôt in a million years go to White House or let myself be a prop in their photo ops. You had a chance to make a statement and refused, did the opposite.  You failed; you are complicit. Congratulations. You‚Äôve let us down.
@BlakLibertarian @KathleanConner @klynnelaraway @GayMafia1969 @cameron_kasky @NRA I predict that thousands of decent and responsible gun owners will leave the NRA and there will be massive boycotts.  What‚Äôs left will be scary fringe version. The Russian injection of money/laundering will be revealed and eventually the NRA will be sanctioned/marginalized. Enjoy
RT @TeamPelosi: If you are ready to get Ryan, McConnell, Trump and Pence out of the way of our progress, if you are ready for victory in No‚Ä¶
@The_Trump_Train You should issue a tweet to correct your statement. Colton‚Äôs dad doctored the email. Dishonest not to correct your tweet.
@votevets Heroism immediately followed by doctoring emails to defame CNN for political reasons. #Sad
@mschlapp @pawnstars I am so looking forward to watching you fade into the realm of irrelevancy... a sad, racist dinosaur
@Sheryl_Lynn_NB @zeitgeistbabe @mattmfm It‚Äôs the worst Groundhog Day movie you can imagine
@OrrinHatch @MichaelSteele Save it. You are revealed although we already knew. Your legacy is soiled. Swamp to the end.
@OrrinHatch @MichaelSteele Just look at CPAC - chants of ‚Äúlock her up!‚Äù, boos regarding immigration, vilifying the Democrats. Honestly I am ashamed to be American. Fuck you, Hatch. Glad you are retiring. We will bring honor to our country again, thanks to future generations like the parkland kids.
@jwilson_detroit @MichaelSteele He tried to say Steele‚Äôs speaking out over the past few years is to blame. Ridiculous. They are revealed for who they are. Racist lowlifes.
@MichaelSteele You must be heartbroken to realize you wasted decades of your life with these sycophantic racists. Nauseating.
@dandrezner If you look at the account it‚Äôs more of a joke. Some guy pretending to be a Russian bot. Kinda funny.
@Bodiesthatmove @claytonhauck @maggieNYT In addition, we spend a lot of time trying to figure out where people on Twitter stand (such as Maggie)
@realDonaldTrump Many of these mass shootings are done by mentally ill young men and they expect to die by suicide or cops shooting them. Teacher with gun is not a deterrent because these guys expect to die anyway.
@jkrem32 @EastStandSal @KathleanConner @klynnelaraway @GayMafia1969 @cameron_kasky @NRA Republicans are beholden to the NRA because it provides funding that helps them stay in power. It increasingly looks like the Russians are funneling money to the GOP through the NRA. there is no equivalency here- PP is not providing money to Democrat campaigns.
@LowerMyBills I recommend that you remove trump‚Äôs name from your tweets if you want a good response. Also give credit to obama and not trump if you must connect it to a president.
@homebody315 @ExportedFromMI @Gmar3DMM @NatashaBertrand @Twitter @jack @TwitterSupport @Walmart Lady, if it‚Äôs on the Walmart website , then Walmart is selling it!  You are making lame excuses.
@EastStandSal @KathleanConner @klynnelaraway @GayMafia1969 @cameron_kasky @NRA Exactly. That‚Äôs what has to happen. Then all these arguments won‚Äôt be necessary.
@Workhorse95 @MilaceMcnair @Hollyzoomt @KathleanConner @klynnelaraway @GayMafia1969 @cameron_kasky @NRA No, I was pointing out that you pivoted to abortion rather than staying on gun control.
@Workhorse95 @MilaceMcnair @Hollyzoomt @KathleanConner @klynnelaraway @GayMafia1969 @cameron_kasky @NRA This is called the pivot technique. Kelly Anne is really good at it.  When you get stuck in an argument, you just change the subject and accuse the other party of something really heinous. Lame.
@Workhorse95 @jciv @Hollyzoomt @MilaceMcnair @KathleanConner @klynnelaraway @GayMafia1969 @cameron_kasky @NRA So you were saying about ad hominem attacks?  What was that?
@Workhorse95 @MilaceMcnair @Hollyzoomt @KathleanConner @klynnelaraway @GayMafia1969 @cameron_kasky @NRA Can‚Äôt you stay on topic for a minute?
@Workhorse95 @JeanneDuffy @KathleanConner @MilaceMcnair @klynnelaraway @GayMafia1969 @cameron_kasky @NRA It‚Äôs amazing to me how the alt-right typically resorts to whataboutism and blaming Hillary/Obama for everything. It would be hilarious if it didn‚Äôt remind me of how utterly stupid  millions of Americans are. The downfall of America unfolding right in front of us.
@4funswimbikerun @KathleanConner @klynnelaraway @GayMafia1969 @cameron_kasky @NRA Of course there was massive coverage of that church shooting.  There‚Äôs extensive coverage of all mass shootings. Fake outrage?  The country has been seriously mourning through all of these tragedies.  The only agenda is to stop the mass shootings.
@MilaceMcnair @Workhorse95 @carterjr78 @KathleanConner @klynnelaraway @GayMafia1969 @cameron_kasky @NRA I love this tweet. The NRA supporters apparently don‚Äôt care if we are on a path to rapid self-destruction. Having no limits on weapons is what‚Äôs most important. I rarely hear anyone wanting to take away the 2nd amendment. Its just the assault-style weapons. NRA doesn‚Äôt get it
@4funswimbikerun @KathleanConner @klynnelaraway @GayMafia1969 @cameron_kasky @NRA #Facts, not excuses. How you can be ok with people owning military assault weapons and the slaughter of innocent children- I‚Äôll truly never understand.  And then you vilify and twist the motives of those opposed to gun free-for- all‚Äôs.  How do you sleep at night?
@davidsirota This one says page not found
@4funswimbikerun @KathleanConner @klynnelaraway @GayMafia1969 @cameron_kasky @NRA The shootings in Chicago are horrible but they are targeted, gang-related, and kill fewer people in a given incident. They are not mass school shootings executed by a young student with mental illness. These are two completely different things. The latter is also a new thing.
@goepat_patrick @KathleanConner @klynnelaraway @GayMafia1969 @cameron_kasky @NRA Alisyn Camerota interviewed Dana Loesch on CNN this morning and she stated ratings are NOT up as a result of the shootings. She said Americans have reached full saturation with so many mass shootings and they‚Äôd rather look away (I.e., LOWER ratings).   Dig deeper on your facts.
@KathleanConner @klynnelaraway @GayMafia1969 @cameron_kasky @NRA When an organization says the media loves school shootings for the ratings, yet the reporters and commentators are all in tears, i think that organization needs to be called out. I get your point but I personally feel the NRA is truly evil.
@HoarseWisperer And yet, the drooling idiots at C-PAC chant ‚Äúlock her up!!‚Äù  What a world.
@decmusicology @kkearns @chrislhayes üòÇ lol
@KathleanConner @klynnelaraway @GayMafia1969 @cameron_kasky We need to reform the @NRA. they vilify everyone else, divide us, and create a very dangerous world. The NRA is the problem and discussion is needed.
@JoyAnnReid Disgusting. Why am I not surprised
@JohnnyGWeir @taralipinski @terrygannon83 @NBCOlympics You guys were really awesome. I love figure skating- have for 30 years!  Thanks for making the Olympics a wonderful viewing experience. ‚ù§Ô∏èüòò
@AriMelber @Nyxiedust No paycheck but huge access to investors who control billions of dollars. That access is priceless to people needing capital. Who wouldn‚Äôt work for free to get that access???!
@benshapiro Geeze you are 100% Trumpian. Name-calling is all you can do. You guys are a joke. Ted is a good man, fighting for what‚Äôs right, for what his constituents want.  You‚Äôre an embarrassment to America.
@LowerMyBills Ok @LowerMyBills , you are muted and blocked. You ruined it. Fuck him.
@MeghanMcCain @yashar Like ‚ÄúSpringtime for Hitler‚Äù from ‚ÄúThe Producers‚Äù.
@jsinvr @SaysHummingbird @owillis My high school friend was at Harvard law with Cruz. Said he was smart/irritating but not at all religious or populist at that time. He mentioned something about ted getting in trouble for breaking in somewhere to get documents... connected to a Bush?  I need to look it up.
@juliecheckoway @DanCarlsonSEA @SethAbramson You can‚Äôt live an outwardly lavish lifestyle and pay taxes on a disproportionate income level. That is a red flag. Not a very smart tax evader and money launderer.
@juliecheckoway @DanCarlsonSEA @SethAbramson If manafort was making all these giant fees in the Ukraine and elsewhere, how did he get so far in debt to the Russian oligarch? Did he make terrible real estate investments with his son in law?  How could he not realize his high profile would lead to investigations about wealth?
@Boatsandbridges @SethAbramson If by that you mean taking his own life, it is a possibility. He was suffering severe depression and suicidal before getting involved in the campaign. Check out the recent Fresh Air podcast about manafort. I hope not, but the thought has crossed my mind.
@timjacobwise I mean just look at how young people like Alexander Hamilton were when they did amazing, important things.
@TPM Drooling idiots as @billmaher would say. They are singing the same old tune. Get a life people!!
@realDonaldTrump Did you get thumbs up photos with you toothy grin?
@realDonaldTrump You‚Äôll get it done. LOL. what a joke. We‚Äôll get it done when we finally vote out those supported by @nra, and when you resign. It will take longer, but we will do it. No thanks to you.
@PhotoJT @VoteMarsha @PhilBredesen Can‚Äôt wait. Marsha is toxic.
@marcorubio Sending bots and prayers your way.  You will be voted out. You are the problem.
@JohnAvlon The elite don‚Äôt care about schools and kids??  Couldn‚Äôt be further from the truth. That‚Äôs the whole reason we want common sense gun reforms.
@PattiSolisDoyle @DLoesch Also she‚Äôs very offensive to mentally Ill people. Crazy is a negative slur.
@Sheasy64 @DrewGriffinCNN @donie @scottbronstein @CNNMoney ‚Äú....threw the US election TO DONALD TRUMP‚Äù
@Serahwersh @Amy_Siskind @NRA Didn‚Äôt trump always brag that he self-funded the campaign and didn‚Äôt take any swamp money?  Serious question. That was probably a lie too.
@newmonic @yashar @WIRED The only one she‚Äôll believe is trump. She‚Äôs utterly hopeless and I don‚Äôt feel sorry for her.
@DonnaGail262 Sadly, not at all surprising. This is the world we live in. Face it, lots of Americans have the disease known as Trumpism.
@Sheasy64 @DrewGriffinCNN @donie @scottbronstein @CNNMoney Lol where do you get your facts ?  We‚Äôll NEVER KNOW whether Russian interference changed votes. Americans themselves don‚Äôt even know if, on a subconscious level, a fake news article influenced their vote. This is the game of the Russians , spreading disinformation. It worked!
@Sheasy64 @JudgeJanna @DrewGriffinCNN @donie @scottbronstein @CNNMoney I think you are missing the whole point of Drew Griffin‚Äôs piece. Seriously, does it not concern you that she was fueled by the Russians and STILL doesn‚Äôt believe it?  If not,  then it‚Äôs just hopeless.
@Sheasy64 @DrewGriffinCNN @donie @scottbronstein @CNNMoney False narrative?  It‚Äôs the exact narrative that needs to be discussed. 2016 will go down in history as the year that Russia secretly threw the US election to trump because Americans were stupid!!
@JudgeJanna @DrewGriffinCNN @donie @scottbronstein @CNNMoney You are entitled to your opinions. I‚Äôve admired Michael Moore for years and find him to be extremely smart, talented, and educated on the issues of the day. Agree to disagree on Michael Moore. You want unhinged?  Try ‚Äújudge‚Äù Jeanine, Alex jones, Tommi  Laren.
@JudgeJanna @DrewGriffinCNN @donie @scottbronstein @CNNMoney Idiocy is clinging to a belief because you desperately want it to be true, despite actual facts to the contrary.  We‚Äôll never know how many votes were changed due to Russian intervention. They pushed fake news like pizzagate, which def cost Hillary some votes.
@JudgeJanna @DrewGriffinCNN @donie @scottbronstein @CNNMoney The difference being - someone like  michael Moore is smart and reasonable and would gladly admit he was duped. Don‚Äôt you people care about Russian intervention? U just scream fake news to everything. It‚Äôll be your party next time. Then what?  It‚Äôs ok as long as you win?
@DrewGriffinCNN @donie @scottbronstein @CNNMoney Thank you Drew, for helping to show, on a basic level, how the Russians manipulated Americans and the election. Great, revealing piece of work.
@Ryegeleye @EsotericCD Drew was perfectly calm and polite. She was more than willing to spew her toxic ideology. So funny how she played the Hillary card!!!  Lol, the default comeback to anything they don‚Äôt like.
@Ryegeleye @EsotericCD Exactly!  I don‚Äôt see it as an ambush or attack. Not in the least.
@chrislhayes @InSpiteOfTrump @peterjhasson @brandondarby @jessesingal It was a story about Russians manipulating ignorant Americans and our political system. She exemplifies the typical Trumpster. She STILL doesn‚Äôt believe it. She didn‚Äôt look like a victim to me. Dishing it out strongly and with venom. The story shows what we are dealing with.
@PalmerReport Lock the up!!!
@christinawilkie @SteveESpaulding So swampy. Good grief
@CherieRiles @PaulBegala Same here!  I always read his ruh roh tweets. Very informative.
@BillClinton Yeah I‚Äôm with the anti-Billy G club. He was more bad than good for sure. But whatever.
@sacmac11 Classic Dunning-Kruger effect. Shockingly dumb people.
@latimes It‚Äôs as if he specifically set out to make all the worst possible decisions for our country. The Trump era is far worse than I feared.
@TruthTeamOne Can‚Äôt judge a book by its cover but that dude looks sketchy!!
@PushDicksButton Brilliant!  I‚Äôve got chills...
@MittRomney That‚Äôs an endorsement I would rebuff.
@WalshFreedom You say a lot of true and almost wise things. Why go and blow it with this dotard statement?  The world is not black and white. Slaughtering children at school is NOT OK in America. We need to find our way out of the darkness. Be a part of the solution.
@axios @politico The existing and potential charges against manafort are massive, although a lot have nothing to do with trump. I see zero basis for pardoning him. He needs to be held accountable for his substantial crimes.
@Kris_Sacrebleu I listened to a Fresh Air podcast recently, about Manafort. I won‚Äôt be surprised if he takes his own life before the facts are known. He‚Äôs been suicidal before, unfortunately.
@jaketapper Great interview with @davidaxelrod    You should tweet out some of your cartoons!!
@KeithH6910 @JJohnsonLaw @soledadobrien And we need him to keep speaking out , but that hasn‚Äôt happened
@cmclymer I think of George papadapoulos every time. Driving me nuts!
@PushDicksButton I‚Äôll never forget. So truly beautiful
@CNN It was very disappointing that Gates was not willing to openly speak the truth about how destructive Trump has been and will be. Surprising actually.
@yashar Agree 100% @yashar.  It‚Äôs funny that on the other hand, marinara sauce is great!
@ljl54313 @AngrierWHStaff One would hope the First Lady cares about all of America‚Äôs children and not just her own.
@chrissoriano13 @Tortured_Verse @tomwatson @Mets People care because our country is being ruined and 17 children were slaughtered. Trump is dangerous to the world and I want nothing to do with anyone who supports him. It actually matters more than sports.
@HoarseWisperer So true!
@mattyglesias As far as I‚Äôm concerned, they are all smiling and seem happy to be in a photo with Trump. They are all normalizing this man, so they are part of the problem. The way to get change is boycott and protest him at every turn.
@Racheldoesstuff Am I the only one offended by this song?  I‚Äôm single, in my 40s and have cats. So you‚Äôre implying I‚Äôm a giant loser?  I really thought your show was different and said it was ok to be who you are. Very disappointed. Used to be a massive fan.
@AP_Politics Biggest obstacle for Gavin is the fact that he was once married to Kimberley Guilfoyle of Fox News. Seriously hard for me to get past that (Of course I will).
@brianklaas Plus, there is a black market for getting  guns in Chicago. Most of the murders in Chicago are happening in extremely low income and crime-ridden gang territories. These people are not getting their guns in the same way as others.
@TranslateRealDT The people look very happy and more than willing to pose with him. THAT is the saddest part of the photos. We need people to wake up to what is going on here. Upside down world. Gun control should be the defining issue of 2018. Vote out anyone opposed to gun reform, period.
@AngrierWHStaff Honestly I‚Äôm surprised Melanie is smiling too. I expected her, as a mom, to realize that the aftermath of a slaughter is not the time to smile for a photo op. Surprised at the others too. Anyone who supports trump at this point needs help.
@KatAdler21 @PrincessBravato @JohnWDean If Scalice being shot didn‚Äôt change him, nothing will. We need the kids to take the lead. Vote the @NRA supporters OUT!!
@brianklaas These are truly defective humans
@TheViewFromLL2 @MrJonCryer Smiling like he‚Äôs opening a new hotel or something. Thumbs up everyone!!  This guy is the Antichrist
@4everNeverTrump @RobinBrenizer Talk about politicizing a tragedy. Is the governor in the tank for trump?
@realDonaldTrump I don‚Äôt get why all these people are smiling like they‚Äôre at Disney World. I wouldn‚Äôt take a picture with Trump to save my life.  Another pointless photo op. Gross.
@mrsmaris Don‚Äôt forget Comey
@maggieNYT Yes, congratulations are certainly in order. Trump is such a dick. Completely tone deaf.
@JohnnyGWeir You and Tara are doing an amazing job. Bravo Johnny!  I miss your skating.
RT @Myrddn: Bob Weiss	14 hrs near Thousand Oaks ¬∑  	My daughter was murdered in a mass school shooting. What makes you believe that your ch‚Ä¶
@VicenteFoxQue @billmaher @HBO Omg can‚Äôt wait!!!
@JMunozActor Why would the unfollow?  Javi is perfectly wonderful
@leoncrawl Hmmm. I don‚Äôt agree but that opinion is likely the result of my strong feelings of disgust for the Trump admin and Mnuchin‚Äòs disastrous tax bill. I just see them as evil cartoon characters and the article did nothing to change that.  Interesting to dive a little deeper I guess.
@leoncrawl @scarylawyerguy Congrats on the podcast series. I thoroughly enjoyed each episode and learned so much. Looking forward (sort of LOL) to the Clinton series.
@leoncrawl I don‚Äôt have the patience to read the article but I would certainly never degrade the image of Martha Mitchell by likening her in any way to Louise Linton.
@ricedaddy7 Ha great point!!!  So true.
@WalshFreedom @NRA It‚Äôs pretty simple, the NRA makes it incredibly easy for dangerous people to get military weapons. How can this be a good thing?  This is a new thing. Wasn‚Äôt happening weekly just 10 years ago.  #GunReformNow
@TeaPainUSA Oooh you are so right. Please let this be a dark but short chapter in American history.
@TeaPainUSA I‚Äôd really love an update from the SC‚Äôs office. This is dragging out endlessly.  Need to know status and where this is headed.
@jonfavs In other words, even young victims of the actual shooting are somewhat brainwashed about the 2nd amendment. SAD üò¢
@jonfavs What makes me sad is they interviewed a kid at Parkland who was worried about the impact the shooting will have on the football program. Reporter asked what should be done. He said pray for victims and thank the first responders.  Not a word about gun control or social media.
@maggieNYT I have such a love - hate relationship with Maggie !  My feelings about her change daily. So frustrating !
@krassenstein Madness!!!  Seriously living in an insane and upside down world.
@MichelleWKwan I‚Äôm really enjoying this Olympics and just wanted to say - I miss you Michelle!  You are such an amazing skater and a wonderful person. Nice to see you enjoying life and doing lots of fun things. You gave America so many thrills in the Olympics, thanks!  Xo
@WalshFreedom The Republicans can‚Äôt ignore what they are doing to deficit and debt. It‚Äôs unconscionable
@TheGranVarones Just beautiful. I always loved Rudy. One of my all-time favorite skaters. I hope he‚Äôs enjoying everyone‚Äôs memories of him and watching the Olympics!
@RudyValGalindo Is it really you Rudy??  I loved your skating so much and you are also a lovely, special person. Seeing the Twitter Moments of you brings back great memories. Glad to see you are still out there and active in skating.  You paved the way for many. Love ya ‚ù§Ô∏è
@_MelRodriguez_ omg is this your doppelg√§nger?? https://t.co/gzPwlarX0d
@nowthisnews There will be other portraits painted of them in the typical style. These are just the first ones , done by painters chosen by the Obamas. Chill out everyone!
@jehorowitz @DavidAFrench I happen to agree with 99% of what she said on Real Time. We can‚Äôt be knee-jerk liberals on every issue. It‚Äôs a complicated issue and as a society it will take time to hit the reset button. 75% of Millenials think asking to have a drink is sexual assault??  Wtf, gone too far.
@RandyRainbow I love you!  Absolutely brilliant.  When are you going to be King George????  C'mon @Lin_Manuel !!!!!
@bariweiss @ishaantharoor Good grief, what a pointless waste of energy. I completely get what you tweeted and why and absolutely don‚Äôt think you‚Äôre a racist. On top of that, you were excellent on Real Time. You described it perfectly.  I agree with you 100% on all points about #MeToo.  Congrats to skater.
@jamesmiglehart @NikkyWalks @HamiltonMusical Lol brilliant. Love you all, nonstop
@fahimanwar @TimODee16 There are many from regular middle class families. Tonya Harding is a bit of a punchline but was a world class skater from a low income family.
@Adaripp @cameronesposito During the Olympics for the ladies‚Äô long program.
@Adaripp @cameronesposito I think a funny SNL sketch would be to have Tonya Harding giving color commentary. So many possibilities with that one. Amazing skating Adam !!! Congrats üòò

@pacelattin @mattgaetz Good lord, let this be a joke!!!  Anyone who feels Gaetz is qualified for something like that is insane. The Tin Foil Hat Party.
@Montel_Williams They also had restraining orders and documentation of the assaults. He did admit to some of what happened-said it was exaggerated.

@jonathandarman Given how they‚Äôve treated Hillary Clinton, respect and sacredness are the LAST words that come to mind regarding women.
@senorrinhatch Hatch was attacking the ones who were attacked by Porter. Revealing of Hatch‚Äôs character but not at all surprising. #RetireinDisgrace
@donlemon Love you Bae. So sorry for your loss.... ((hugs)). Ana was right...authentic. Watch you every night  xo. Thank you.
@shayanmodarres @LynnePatton @SecretaryCarson @AprilDRyan And Carson doesn‚Äôt seem to care. I‚Äôd never tolerate this from an employee. But apparently he has his own problems to try and cover up.
@shayanmodarres @LynnePatton @SecretaryCarson @AprilDRyan Sadly, even if she stays off twitter, all she seems to do is photo ops. She likes tweeting ‚Äúproof‚Äù of her excellent work, but it‚Äôs pure puffery. People who actually kick a## at work and make a difference don‚Äôt troll and pat themselves on the back.  She‚Äôs Trumpian thru and thru
@JeffFlake If you are planning to run for POTUS, don‚Äôt bother. You killed it with your vote on the tax scam.
@DonaldJTrumpJr He is so full of hate. In his perfect world all of the Democrats would just jump off a cliff and die. He‚Äôs never once tried to unify or see the other side.  He‚Äôll be popular in the history books as the bitter, dumb, mean, lying son.

@Amy_Siskind @Kris_Sacrebleu Your twitter feed will tell the story. I hope you are archiving it. It‚Äôs kind brilliant most of the time.
@LauraLoomer Do you just blame Democrats for everything you don‚Äôt like?
@jake_snowflake @alt_lawyer @RealAlexJones Imagine being married to this lunatic.
@tedlieu @realDonaldTrump Lol adorable
@ProudResister So true. I try watching Fox all the time but nothing in my perception ever changes. They are just blatantly being used as Trump‚Äôs tool. Totally biased and unbalanced.
@PattyArquette Politics in Illinois has been insane lately, similar to Arizona. The Democrat will win by a mile for this race. But still, disappointing to see this kind of thing becoming more mainstream.
@AJentleson Wow. I miss Harry Reid. I miss life before Trump.
@davidfrum Great job, David. You‚Äôre one of the true patriots in today‚Äôs insane world. Down with Trumplandia!  I wish Maher had let you pursue the questions about Mooch‚Äôs firm.
@runPattirun Just watching that is unbearable. Can‚Äôt stand Gowdy but he‚Äôs smarter by a mile than Nunes. I think he may be in line for Sessions‚Äô job. Don‚Äôt trust him.
@tedlieu @realDonaldTrump Love you @tedlieu !!!  So glad you are my congressman here in west Los Angeles!  As @tribelaw says, you are on the right side of history.
@krassenstein Of course!  If it‚Äôs good he takes credit, if bad then blames others. #Dotard
@Mikey_Vengenz @HarmonyRachell @michaelnilsso11 @cindy77778 @BillKristol @POTUS @realDonaldTrump Besides, I‚Äôm certain the NTSB has done/is doing a careful investigation, especially w/ so many members of Congress on the train. It‚Äôs possible Kristol learned of the crash sooner than the rest of us due to his communication channels. If he was in on it he wouldn‚Äôt have tweeted
@Mikey_Vengenz @HarmonyRachell @michaelnilsso11 @cindy77778 @BillKristol @POTUS @realDonaldTrump If someone really wanted to get to the bottom of it they could research the exact times that word got out locally (in VA) and to various media outlets. Just because Amtrak said 11:20 doesn‚Äôt mean that local sources or inside government sources didn‚Äôt report on it earlier.
@HarmonyRachell @cindy77778 @Mikey_Vengenz @BillKristol @POTUS @realDonaldTrump This is a case of Occam‚Äôs Razor-the simplest most obvious explanation is the correct one. It appears the source (Amtrack) that provided the crash time of 11:20 Eastern made a mistake. It‚Äôs just preposterous to think Bill Kristol and many others had advance knowledge. Call NTSB
@IronStache @chelseahandler @PRyan Senator Orrin Hatch Office is pushing this story too. We should all be falling over ourselves, grateful for $78 per year, apparently
@CharlesMBlow @TheDailyEdge I‚Äôm so sorry Charles. Love and prayers...
@AngrierWHStaff @BretBaier I disagree with you on @BretBaier - he seems pretty brainwashed to me. Also what I don‚Äôt get is why, after all of the sexual harassment scandals, do they continue to dress the women up in cocktail dresses and do hair and makeup line it‚Äôs  a porn shoot?
@imsokelsey @JunkYardGypsies @LynnePatton She‚Äôs hard at work uniting the country https://t.co/uh9LT50XCB
@imsokelsey @JunkYardGypsies @LynnePatton Shithole countries? Many fine people on both sides?  Not renting to people of color? Whatever, you r brainwashed. Believe what you like. I‚Äôm fine with those questions to a proven racist. April is an outstanding journalist. Enjoy your ugly racism and loathsome prez while u can
@TPM Hooray!!!
@imsokelsey @JunkYardGypsies @LynnePatton She works for American Urban Radio Networks, so of course she will ask questions that pertain to people of color. That‚Äôs to be expected. Doesn‚Äôt make her a race-baiter.  I embrace  racial diversity and detest racists.  If u dislike me for that then I‚Äôm sad for you.
@Lin_Manuel @jmessinaphoto @VAMNit I am crying. Love you both!  My rays of sunshine amidst much darkness in the world these days.
@imsokelsey @JunkYardGypsies @LynnePatton Just because you don‚Äôt agree with her, doesn‚Äôt mean she isn‚Äôt respected. On what basis do you feel she isn‚Äôt a respectable journalist?  Is this race-related or party affiliation?  I disagree with most Republicans but still respect a few of them. Sounds like a knee-jerk comment
@HollyFriendGA @LynnePatton @snjtown @people @JZEvents @HUDNY_NJ Hello #TimeZoneDifferences. Ever heard of it?
@LynnePatton Seriously, get back to work. WTH are we paying you for....
@LynnePatton @people @JZEvents @HUDNY_NJ @POTUS @LynnePatton started trolling me at 4:44 am Eastern and ‚Äúliking‚Äù Loomer comments earlier than that. I‚Äôm in the Pacific time zone so it was 1:44 am here. Regardless, I don‚Äôt think government officials should be trolling liberals in the wee hours. Professional conduct nonexistent
@LynnePatton @people @JZEvents @HUDNY_NJ I just love that paid government employees are up in the middle of the night trolling liberals on twitter.  If I were in your position I‚Äôd focus on the work and service to country and not twitter fights.  Your appointment not based on merit, so u have a lot to prove.
@LynnePatton @curveballpete @LauraLoomer @people @JZEvents @HUDNY_NJ Hi @AprilDRyan - just FYI- your favorite person @LynnePatton is trolling again. This time at 445 am. She‚Äôs a lovely girl , no?
@LynnePatton @curveballpete @LauraLoomer @people @JZEvents @HUDNY_NJ ‚Äú....across the aisle faster than ever before‚Äù.....  LOL. trump must have mandatory training for his appointees in truthful hyperbole. He lies daily and I have no reason to suspect you are any different. Photo ops is all you guys do. I‚Äôll stay tuned tho and give you credit if due
@LynnePatton @curveballpete @LauraLoomer @people @JZEvents @HUDNY_NJ Nice photo ops. You‚Äôve burned your bridges &amp; had no credibility to begin with. In Trumplandia, U will always have some nutty supporters, but the rest of us see through the BS. Aligning with Loomer is a TERRIBLE move for your already-horrible image. Are u friends w/Rage Furby too?
@chuckwoolery So you are fine saying you have a problem with gay men and strong women?  Trust me, white men still run the world.  You seemed so nice and cool on your silly dating show. How‚Äôd you end up being such a jerk?
@JunkYardGypsies @LynnePatton Yes, exactly. In addition, I don‚Äôt think Patton deserves that position based on her behavior towards April Ryan. A sr. gov‚Äôt official should not be tweeting Miss Piggy üê∑ pictures to a respected journalist (ie, fat shaming). It‚Äôs childish, nasty, undignified. Fireable offense IMO

@senorrinhatch You‚Äôre really going out in style. Partisan til the very end. Can‚Äôt wait until you are GONE from the Senate. Your obsequious comments about trump are disgusting. Yes, I know he misquoted you to an extent, but still... the Rose Garden.
@JunkYardGypsies @LynnePatton My comment was the result of my belief that a wedding planner is qualified to plan weddings but not qualified for a high level position within  HUD.  People spend decades preparing for such opportunities. hats off to wedding planners.
@LynnePatton Look, you alt-right people can believe whatever batsh@t crazy stuff you like,  but you should recognize that Patton, Carson and Trump are in the Federal government. We simply can‚Äôt have racists and racist sympathizers in power. Association w/Loomer = unacceptable when in Office.
@Patsy_Paddock @LauraLoomer You do know I was quoting Trump, don‚Äôt you?  Please say that you are aware of this. That‚Äôs your king. Nice language skills, right??

@EileenRDavis @JonahNRO @morningmika Agreed. I‚Äôve watched a lot of Wolff interviews and he never says or intimates that it was Haley. However, there is a section that discusses Hicks in a ‚Äúbingo!‚Äù Kind of Way.....  sorry but I believe Wolff on most things. I like Mika but that was fake and silly outrage
@senorrinhatch Is that an Onion story?  Give me a freaking break.
@RepMattGaetz You‚Äôre  coco-loco and you like Nazis.  Your political career will be over soon enough and then you‚Äôll be sleeping on your mom‚Äôs couch. Lol.

@dog_feelings You are a very brave guard dog. Keeping humans and frens safe. Thank you. Reminder that I love you. LOL. Why do I enjoy this twitter account so much? LOL.
@BCAppelbaum Outrageous. I loathe this man with every fiber of my being
@SenJohnMcCain @nytimes Why are you saying nothing about release the memo?  Are you also a trump yes-man?
@SaraMurray I know it‚Äôs all about the reporting but i have to say I love the new hairstyle!
Wouldn‚Äôt it be funny if Stephen Miller is the last man standing? It seems like they are all going down  for various acts of obstruction or conspiracy with Russia but Miller is just a regular old racist. He has stayed focused on immigration policy and speeches, not the other stuff
@NBCNews It‚Äôs funny how some politicians really give you a good feeling - like Corey booker, obama and Biden. I love them. But then some just make you nauseous .  Trey gowdy to me is just a sinister , corrupt, nasty weirdo.
@NBCNews I think he‚Äôll be the replacement for Sessions.
@ProudResister It makes sense though since trump doesn‚Äôt know how to read or do emails (she does so for him) and we always hear Hope knows everything about everything, all the secrets.  Makes sense that she can bring him down or bring herself down if she has lied.
@jenstatsky Remember when Jared arrived on Capitol Hill to be interviewed and he made a short public statement?  He was all smiles and waves, like a movie star. He was smiling and waving to save his life. Had to give the APPEARANCE of innocence and  nonchalance. #TotalPhony
@lrozen I agree with you on ‚Äúcleanse‚Äù being a truly horrible word in the context of government and politics. Don‚Äôt people know about the history of ethnic / religious cleansing?  Come up with another word people!
https://t.co/v9SwsYS0zW
@AdamParkhomenko @HarleyRouda She probably thought it was ok because the emails had been deleted. They are incompetent, unsophisticated and corrupt from top to bottom. Obviously anything in a deleted email will be discovered.
@TheRickyDavila @TomiLahren She‚Äôs positively vile. If Fox has a shred of decency left, they will stop giving her air time. This is a good test to see Just  how far down in the gutter Fox now is.

@HarmonyRachell @BillKristol @POTUS @realDonaldTrump If you truly think bill kristol had advance knowledge of the crash then I‚Äôm sad for you. If he did, he would not tweet prior to the actual crash. Far too smart for that. Do some additional research. No conspiracy on this one. Get Help.
@HarmonyRachell @BillKristol @POTUS @realDonaldTrump Look, whoever estimated the time at 11:20 was wrong. If you read Warner‚Äôs tweet, clearly a lot had already occurred before he tweeted. He already knew about fatalities and  buses, so it‚Äôs not like it happened a few seconds before the tweet. Sorry, there is just no conspiracy. https://t.co/D5y4ti8QLb
@HarmonyRachell @BillKristol @POTUS @realDonaldTrump Obviously you have the time wrong when you say it happened at 11:20.
@DineshDSouza @buffoon_hero When the words are profound, important and poignant , it‚Äôs fine to quote oneself. In these frightening times, it‚Äôs helpful to the rest of us. Thank you James Comey.

@funder Awfully young to be retiring !  He‚Äôs got the Chaffetz flu!
@tedlieu @FBI If the Democratic memo can‚Äôt be released (I.e., is blocked) then could you have a press conference where you lay out the facts to explain why the Nunes memo is bogus?
@clairesaunders @AlistairM2 @RandyRainbow Good grief, the MAGAts are just unbelievably dumb. I‚Äôm sure whatever device she‚Äôs using tells when she has spelling errors. Like facts and logic, she chooses to ignore spell check.  It‚Äôs spelled VETERAN you dummy!!
@brianklaas There has been drama EVERY SINGLE DAY since this buffoon took office. Worse than I could‚Äôve imagined at the time he received the nomination.
@JTMann05 @HillaryClinton Speak for yourself. I care greatly,  as do tens of millions of others.
@Abacus88 @chaoticangel38 @WalshFreedom The Republicans claim the Democratic memo hasn‚Äôt been reviewed for sources and means and therefore should not be released. However, trump has five days to decide, which is plenty of time to review a memo. No excuse!
@TheOnion @TrumpsareNazis @ICEgov Hard to tell real news from Onion News anymore. Thanks for the laughs though.
@chaoticangel38 @WalshFreedom I‚Äôd prefer that the truth come out fully and that our political system not be controlled by outside forces, EVEN IF  that means my side ‚Äúloses‚Äù. Context and balance are needed. I find it unpatriotic and irresponsible to only release the Nunes version. The ‚Äúus vs. them‚Äù must stop
@chaoticangel38 @WalshFreedom Ok but why not release both memos?  And why not allow DOJ / FBI to review things first?  What you are demanding seems unreasonable... curious about these points.
@LATstevelopez @jpanzar Great article Steve. Sounds like you have a lot of knowledge about the issue. To me (residing in west LA), it has seemed like an unsolvable problem, despite billions being appropriated. I wonder how many homeless are from out of state. Will look into the Santa Barbara solutions..
@richardhine Nice!!!  Well said Richard.
@SykesCharlie If you are at all surprised that this occurred then you are sadly extremely out of touch with how most Americans as well as celebrities are feeling these days. I applaud them for speaking out and I‚Äôm grateful that they [for now] have the freedom to do so.
@nikkihaley Any opportunity for a photo op will do, right?
@MiaCMitch @nikkihaley Yeah go look at all the little Palestinian girls too, whose lives are even more dangerous now thanks to what‚Äôs happening in Jerusalem.
@janicemin @AlyssaMastro44 It‚Äôs also a shame that Trump, Haley and the rest are ruining America and the world. The most dangerous admin in all of American history.
@BrennanCenter Good grief he is a joke. They‚Äôll say whatever to appeal to the audience. No integrity.
@chefjoseandres @washingtonpost @CafeMilanoDC @realDonaldTrump You are a hero and I respect you greatly. You‚Äôre a bigger person than I. I have ZERO respect for Trumps and will always think the worst of them. In your shoes I could not simply move on. I feel they may have lied to Make the story go away.
@DavidJollyFL He‚Äôs giving Christians a bad name. What a tool.
@jonfavs @mattmfm Nailed it. Barf.
@amysuds @ChrisRBarron Lady, do a google search!  Are you seriously giving ivanka the benefit of the doubt? You MAGAts are so naive and are only capable of knee-jerk reactions. The facts here are pretty simple and frankly appalling. Get a clue.
@ChrisRBarron @CHARHARTMAN Chris Barron is human garbage, a true MAGAt.

@HomeDepot Shareholders should sue him. Home Depot will lose millions over the Neil cavuto interview. Now who is it that has a stupid brain???

@kylegriffin1 @metaquest The big difference?  Obama is a black dude. They are so shamelessly transparent. Bigots up and down the party.
@seanhannity I‚Äôm profoundly anti-hannity but I keep tabs on him. Every time I check his tweets he says tic-toc but nothing ever comes of it. What a tin foil hat-wearing bore.
@fisherstevensbk Terrific work. Thanks
@adamdavidson @fisherstevensbk Watched it today. Great job!  While trump supporters won‚Äôt watch it, maybe  many others will.  Need to spread the word about the con man!!
@DrDenaGrayson Which is all so ridiculous because everyone says Nunes is a dim bulb and his memo is just a bunch of talking points. Nothing damning or new.
@BroadwayGirlNYC I haven‚Äôt as many in a year but I am fortunate to have seen Hamilton in NYC (2x), Chicago, Los Angeles (2x), and San Diego.   Seeing different actors in the various roles makes it really fun. They all have their own wonderful interpretations of the characters.
@TimOBrien Wear it like a badge of honor.
@YNB @MeghanMcCain Seriously @YNB ?  This feels like a betrayal of your values and passions
@MeghanMcCain @secupp @TheView Makes complete sense that you two are best friends. I don‚Äôt say that as a compliment to either of you
@brianschatz Better yet family reunification
Someone needs to revise the logo for the @GOP. Instead of an elephant, make it an overweight, older white guy with a tinfoil hat and Fox News running in the background.
@BillKristol Wolff never suggested it was Haley. I don‚Äôt mind Wolff commenting on the lack of decent behavior by Trump. Fake outrage if you ask me.

@Nick_Chris_ @HamiltonMusical Highlights from last night were The Room,  Theodosia and Wide Enough. Last night had me in tears. The other cast members were fantastic too. Enjoy your time in the best musical ever!!
@Nick_Chris_ @HamiltonMusical I saw you last night - you were STUPENDOUS!!!  I‚Äôve seen Leslie, Wayne, Joshua and Chappelle in that role and my hat is totally off to you. You had huge shoes to fill. You put your own spin on the role and delivered 100%. Felt you were speaking directly to me. Killed it!!

@8igblue @slpng_giants @donlemon @CNNTonight @disqus @CNN You illustrate the point perfectly. No sense of common decency towards your fellow man in the age of Trump and his MAGAts.
@BorisEP @CheriJacobus @CNNPolitics Have you learned nothing from 2016-17?  Your words will come back to bite you. The house of cards is beginning to fall and there will be a price for you to pay for all that you‚Äôve done. Trump et al are a cancer on America.
@SecretaryCarson Americans demand that you comment on the April Ryan situation and that you fire Patton. She‚Äôs dreadful.
@RyanLizza Hey Ryan. Looking forward to seeing you back on CNN soon. I‚Äôm glad they investigated and came to a rational conclusion. Seems that in a few cases people have been wrongly swept up in the #MeToo movement.
@realDonaldTrump Wait I thought you said you were not being investigated???  LOL. get your story straight
@ChrisCuomo Outstanding interview happening now with weasel Scaramucci. You are truly one of the best Chris. Love the new show. Stay safe!
@JasonLeopold Also I love how trump automatically puts the African Americans in charge of things like HUD. he can‚Äôt conceive of them doing anything outside of the ghetto or specific to African Americans. How about putting an African American in Treasury?
@No2Rezone @aravosis @MichelleMeach16 @LynnePatton Lying about education and experience is contagious in the Trump WH.
@Brian_Chovanec @EsotericCD Interesting, did not hear that. During the campaign, Trump basically said he wanted to throw everyone out, so surely a lot of Trump supporters are not happy.
@Brian_Chovanec @EsotericCD Yeah I‚Äôm sure Kelly and Miller are ticked off about the DACA part.
@AprilDRyan @RealBenCarson Not enough. Carson needs to fire her. He‚Äôs pathetic and so is Patton.
@AviAhvee Naturally @DanaRohrabacher is on that list. I‚Äôd expect nothing less.
@krassenstein Classic Trumpian behavior
@Freeyourmindkid Her platform is unclear. I think her top priority is getting attention. I‚Äôm very troubled by those photos and find them to be disqualifying.
@issyelliot @jimjamescomey Love the mom jeans. They are all dorky AF.
@thehill Trump will hire any sycophant. Even if they lie about education and experience. This is a sad and shameful chapter in America‚Äôs history. What a time to be alive.
@slpng_giants @donlemon @CNNTonight @disqus @CNN We‚Äôre f-Ing doomed. Half of America is deplorable and dangerous. I give up.
@SecretaryCarson If you have a shred of humanity or integrity, you will #FireLynnePatton
Two things about Melania surprise me:	- she actually cares about her marriage enough to be upset about Ivana claiming to be First Trump Lady	- she is bothered that he cheated on her with Stormy. I thought she knew he was a cheater?		Maybe Melania will be his undoing  üòâ
@Evan_McMullin He‚Äôs living in crazy town.
@aravosis @LynnePatton General kelly is none too fond of black women so he‚Äôll use this as an excuse to push her out. Ironically, it‚Äôs a totally valid reason and a just outcome.
@JustTheJune0101 @LynnePatton @AprilDRyan @SecretaryCarson Seriously if this woman thought it was ok to tweet such a thing or if she lost control in the moment, she has NO business having a senior Gov position. She lacks judgment and intelligence.
@drakutis @Shermichael_ @CassyBlue3 @therese38 @AprilDRyan @LynnePatton More like a terminal cancer. Outrageous
@Montel_Williams @realDonaldTrump @LynnePatton @AprilDRyan Does anyone know how this squabble began?  It‚Äôs hilarious!!!  I just love @AprilDRyan. She‚Äôs a bit of a hero in the Trump era. Patton is oh so Trumpian.
When I joined Twitter a few years ago I thought I would mostly follow celebrities (actors, musicians, athletes, etc). Nowadays I have zero interest in most celebrities but follow hundreds or thousands of little-known journalists. Trump has really changed the world! It‚Äôs necessary
@Comey Some day this nightmare will be over and we‚Äôll all see how right you were / are about Russia, Trump , the FBI, etc. Please stay outspoken, we really need your voice. Thank you. -America
@maggieNYT Now that Bannon / gorka are out and Kushner is marginalized, is Stephen Miller Trump‚Äôs primary adviser?
I have zero respect for Jack Posobiec and I‚Äôm proud that he blocked me. However, I think the cheating stories are probably fake. He is a pretty well-known and recognizable guy. He‚Äôs wrong on most issues but not dumb enough to put his pic on a dating profile. https://t.co/PUI07Z6mBR

@Lisa73060857 @ToddGaterTables @kyungkarenmend1 @realDonaldTrump Agreed. It‚Äôs always the trump supporters calling names. His three amazing daughters must be so proud. It will take a generation or two to recover from the level of uncivil discourse that‚Äôs become normalized under Trump. Sometimes it seems like a civil war is coming
After preaching endlessly that Dems needed to do the right thing and end the shutdown for the sake of our country, trump turns around and calls it a humiliating defeat for Dems. He is the OPPOSITE of a unifying leader. He‚Äôs a child and a divider. Anyone who still supports is nuts https://t.co/w68KKXmwaw

@mphrost @JeffFlake Or a third option - he‚Äôs simply trying to redeem himself in our eyes and this type of statement is just for optics. Perhaps he plans to run for POTUS in 2020. I think it‚Äôs the third option. You give him too much credit.
@GovMikeHuckabee @JohnHMerrill Geeze, your followers have atrocious punctuation and spelling. Come talk to me after February 8th. Nothing counts until then. Dems won‚Äôt be tricked into trusting Trump and the @GOP.

@CollinRugg Good people can disagree about political policies. For you to insult those with an opposing viewpoint reveals who you are. You‚Äôre fat-shaming others and seem to be a misogynistic, judgmental creep.  I hope some day you grow up and realize how unkind you have been.
@davidsirota I hear you. But the personal stuff is pretty major and has to be reported. Especially  if evangelicals and other members of his base look the other way. These times will define who we are in America.

@accidntlmystic @tonycoykendall @waltshaub So so true. Enemy over America. Tragic.
@MontyBoa99 @TheBeatWithAri Makes sense. He sure downplayed it in the interview and played dumb... claiming it was a misdemeanor. He looks a bit like a deer looking into headlights.  His sycophantic allegiance to Trump is as bad as his inhumane treatment of prisoners and disregard for the  law. Worst of USA
@jameslemm @Annamar68161835 @swiftyfan6 @jemimaskelley She should have just left. I seriously don‚Äôt get this one. Totally not a sexual assault. And I‚Äôm with the women on  virtually every other case.
@jemimaskelley This is crazy. People need to actually say no if that is what they mean/want. We can‚Äôt burn guys at the cross for not reading minds. Her body language at times suggested she was into it. This is not sexual assault and diminishes the credibility of true accusers. Just say NO/leave
@TheBeatWithAri If AZ votes this monster into the senate, I‚Äôll have trouble setting foot in AZ again.  Hard to say who is worse between him and Kelli ward.

@citygalsports @k80way @azizansari @babedotnet While I normally side with the females, I think he‚Äôs not getting a fair shake. She could‚Äôve left at any point and he would‚Äôve been cool with it. He thought they were both DTF (as the kids say today). She should‚Äôve just high-tailed it out of there. Not comparable to other stories
@krassenstein @EashiaT Kind of like @jasoninthehouse ?  That seemed like a pretty sudden and suspicious resignation but did not get much attention. I still think there‚Äôs more to the story. Gowdy seems suspicious to me also. Good riddance on both counts.

@brooklynmarie @scottwongDC I didn‚Äôt read the entire article but if it truly is inactive and has no revenues or assets, I can‚Äôt imagine that failure to disclose will be fatal ??  I personally think he knows he is despised and didn‚Äôt want to suffer the humiliation of a large loss.

@brithume @Twitter It pains me to agree with @brithume , but I have also noticed recent major slow-downs in the iPhone Twitter app. In addition, today I downloaded the latest iOS and my battery is draining much more quickly than before.
@TVietor08 @DLoesch @VP Not surprised at all. They are birds of a feather.  Sad, depressing, embarrassing.

@ram_mcmahon @MarkSchweitzer @andrealremke @Enquirer Excellent piece. Sorry to all the people I have prejudged in a similar situation. It‚Äôs so wrong and hurtful.  Profoundly sorry for her loss. I hope writing the piece was therapeutic and I wish her peace and the beginning of healing.
@sarahkendzior @JamieOGrady Honestly I also think we should be getting rid of electoral college. No good reason to keep it.

They are ok with it so long as it benefits them. Just baffling. And profoundly sad.
@christianwferry @GovHowardDean Come on @christianwferry, why dont you defend your honor?  Clear it up for us. Cute little bio you have - family / sports dude. Nice cover. I have a feeling you know where the bodies are buried.... got tangled up with manafort and it couldn‚Äôt have been pretty. Also, Palin??  LOL!
@krassenstein @christianwferry Thanks @krassenstein , very interesting. It just doesn‚Äôt seem worth it. If Lindsey was a true patriot he would just come clean about his sexuality and the affair. The price of acquiescing to the blackmail is just too high. I hope this all comes out soon.
@BarackObama is an actual #stablegenius https://t.co/WF8q9zHP68
@FoxNews @cvpayne I‚Äôd also like to know what trump specifically did to improve unemployment numbers for black Americans. I think this is another case of taking credit when it‚Äôs not due.
@EricBoehlert Exactly. However, I keep hearing from credible, reputable experts that even if Sessions goes away, someone new will take over as Special Counsel and there is a ton of damaging documentation out there. Plus whistleblower options. So I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs over if Sessions is out.
@PreetBharara It‚Äôs unbearable to watch her. This is what bitterness and jealousy does to a person. Just her voice makes me nauseous. If all these investigations and attacks shut down the Clinton foundation, will any of these republicans feel bad?
@meghan_daum @nytimes Agree and agree. I listen to @mikiebarb ‚Äòs podcast every morning and just love it.
@GeraldoRivera @MichaelWolffNYC @realDonaldTrump Yes, some fact are wrong, but they are immaterial and certainly don‚Äôt prove that the entire book is false. For example, someone‚Äôs name is misspelled and Wilbur Ross is listed as secretary of labor (not commerce). Big deal. Sloppy editing, but does not disqualify the rest.
@QuinnBradlee Thoroughly enjoyed the documentary about your dad on @HBO , especially the parts you‚Äôre in. He was a great man.
@KaniJJackson @BarackObama and @MichelleObama represent the best part of America. They are beloved by millions of Americans and will go down in history as brilliant, compassionate heroes. #StableGenius
Great documentary on @HBO about Ben Bradlee. Covers Nixon / Watergate and @washingtonpost quite a bit. The parallels between RussiaGate and Watergate are striking. Well done @HBO !

@arneduncan @Kyle_Lierman @BaltCitySchools Could not agree more. I think public schools should get more federal funding to make up for what they don‚Äôt get locally due to a smaller tax base (vs wealthy areas). It‚Äôs shameful that we send kids to schools in such disrepair. How are they supposed to learn under those conditns?
@Sherry09 @AnaCabrera @DanaRohrabacher Come talk to me in the fall, after scores  of Republicans are voted out. I think you‚Äôll feel differently then.
@SykesCharlie Excellent op-ed, very clever. The only thing I take issue with is the fallacious highlighted text.  I certainly don‚Äôt feel that Hatch, Corker and Flake have held Trump accountable for much. It‚Äôs a cliche but history will not be kind to today‚Äôs GOP if they stay silent. https://t.co/EI0HKUJCOw
@bijukgopinat @NesrineMalik Perfect example of the DK effect.
@SenBobCorker Go away #CorkerKickback
@MarkSalter55 @LindseyGrahamSC If Hillary or Huma go to jail for being unintentionally careless with email and servers, that opens things up so that anyone could be jailed for the same thing. With thousands of government employees across the country, this seems like a ridiculous way to go.

The trump admin has countless sycophants, which is stomach-churning at times.  People like Nunes are destroying their political and personal reputations for trump. A total waste.
@traci_g69 @madbum456 @AnaCabrera @DanaRohrabacher @CNN @waltshaub It‚Äôs called ‚ÄúWhat Aboutism‚Äù. It‚Äôs the default argument used by Trumpsters and dictators trying to discredit others. Obviously a pointless and ineffective argument, nonetheless a popular go-to.
@madbum456 @AnaCabrera @DanaRohrabacher @CNN @waltshaub was the chief ethics officer for many years, so clearly was valued and respected. Why are you trashing him?  Because he speaks truth and you don‚Äôt like it? Do you actually listen to what he says?  Are you an expert on gov‚Äôt ethics?

@davidfrum It‚Äôs about time. I‚Äôve been screaming about this for months (in CA). I don‚Äôt understand wth took so long for others to pay attention.
@BeckiLewis @kimweintraub @TMcDevitt11 @miyridian @KatyTurNBC The Trumpers just scream ‚Äòfake news!‚Äô to anything they don‚Äôt like. Will they ever believe?  To Mueller they say fake news!
@kimweintraub @miyridian @KatyTurNBC He‚Äôs the worst person to have ever lived, on this planet or any other, in all the universes, of all time past or present.
@MichaelLuwoye Lol if they knew who you are they would want to sit by you!  I know I would.
@MittRomney Yeah I like Romney better than most Republicans but he sort of killed it by praising Hatch. I love how Hatch gets all fake offended when it is suggested he‚Äôs in it for the rich. Then goes ahead and legislates exclusively to benefit the rich. History will not be kind to Hatch!
@WoodlandSmith_ Just because I‚Äôm a Democrat and a female doesn‚Äôt mean I‚Äôm not familiar with trading stocks, naked short-selling, and other derivative financial instruments. And yes, I think it‚Äôs way over Trump‚Äôs head.  You love name-calling. You must be a lovely and kind, evolved person.
@frodofied Lol. I have changed so many things in my life. I don‚Äôt watch as many tv shows because now I watch so much Cable news. I don‚Äôt spend money on clothes anymore because why bother shopping?  We‚Äôve got bigger problems than fashion choicest!
@mbwcr57 @ScottJenningsKY Just like trump and Nikki Hailey, I‚Äôm taking names!  Of trump enablers....  The Trump era will have reverberations long after he‚Äôs gone.... the enablers will be marginalized.  Or we‚Äôll all be dead due to war :(
@Fuctupmind @seanhannity @HillaryClinton I second that request
@WoodlandSmith_ @ScottJenningsKY Glad that the distinct possibility of mutually assured mass destruction is funny to you. Ever heard of the Dunning-Kruger effect?  Nice that trump is so comfortable using an extremely reckless approach to EVERYONE‚Äôs safety!
@ScottJenningsKY I think making light of the tweets, suggesting we are paranoid (ie, gaslighting) is the way Republicans have decided to cope with the immense guilt they feel for putting us in this ridiculous situation. Soon it will be time to fold your cards. Like watergate..can‚Äôt come soon enuf
@ScottJenningsKY Being a bully and a tough talker is fine if you are dealing with rational people. It‚Äôs no way to deal with an insane dictator who‚Äôs got nukes and a history of committing violent, insane acts. Their pride could kill us all. You‚Äôll laugh but many of us take this situation seriously
@ScottJenningsKY You‚Äôre supposed to be the political expert but I find It to be naive to downplay the situation because it‚Äôs based on a mere tweet. Don‚Äôt underestimate the combination of ego and insanity (on both sides). Just look at what Kim Jong Un is capable of. They both have access to nukes
@ScottJenningsKY Are you seriously unbothered by Trump‚Äôs tweets to Dear Leader?   I know it‚Äôs party over country and everything else for you, but are you not worried about trump starting a war and millions dying?  Where‚Äôs your head at?  Sometimes you actually seem logical but this has me confused
@smartassjek @realDonaldTrump Sounds like a child. He‚Äôs absolutely infantile. Arrested development.
@latimes @latimesopinion If people can‚Äôt get on the 405 because they have to drive to a further-away on-ramp, it will cause massive congestion on streets like Wilshire, smb, Barrington, etc. (already jammed). sorry, I really don‚Äôt think this idea helps.

@ezraklein @matthewjdowd I‚Äôve been saying the same for a year. The Dunning-Kruger effect is described beautifully on This American Life - episode 585 - In Defense Of Ignorance.
@ezraklein @matthewjdowd Trump suffers from narcissism as well as DK, but his followers most definitely suffer from DK. The saddest thing about this past year has been seeing the hidden dark side of America- racism, homophobia, anti-semitism, misogyny, selfishness, lack of empathy, &amp; lack of intelligence
@seanhannity @trish_regan @CNN Serious question- we keep hearing campaigns pay for oppo research all the time. Isn‚Äôt that exactly what happened with the dossier?  That‚Äôs legal. Big whoop.  Trump sought info from foreign govt, which is unlawful.

@REALARMYJUDGE @cvpayne That‚Äôs exactly correct. It has very little to do with illegal immigration. I‚Äôm waiting to see if the billion dollar proposition to fight homelessness in CA does any good. People are trying.
@Ps5725 @cvpayne @TimothyHamby2 The homeless problem in CA is due to mental illness and drugs, not illegal immigration.
@cvpayne Please remember that because of the weather, homeless people make their way to CA. It‚Äôs much easier to be homeless here.  CA has to deal with the nation‚Äôs homeless. MOST HOMELESS ARE MENTALLY ILL OR ADDICTED, NOT ILLEGAL. if you have ideas pls share.

@trish_regan I‚Äôm seriously shocked that you are speaking up and even more shocked that you still have a job. I have extremely low expectations when it comes to trump propaganda tv. I guess once in a while you guys do something that‚Äôs not horrible.

@JRubinBlogger It‚Äôs actually surprising there are so few never trumpers and so few former trumpers. I‚Äôve always been Democrat but had a healthy level of respect for many Republicans. Well, that‚Äôs changed drastically. Those not speaking up are traitors in my book.
@JRubinBlogger They seem to be fine with destroying the fbi and Dept of Justice if it means they get to have president trump. They‚Äôve absolutely lost their minds. And scruples.
@NatashaBertrand @StevePasquale I love John Brennan. Has anyone else noticed that physically he resembles the Russian - Lavrov?  Kinda strange
@brianbeutler Wray and Sessions need to speak up, soon.  Trump is causing Americans to lose faith in DOJ and FBI, while they say and do nothing (other than open new investigations into Clinton and Obama). It‚Äôs disgraceful and surreal to see what‚Äôs happened in Trumplandia.

@galinja @jonathantasini Don‚Äôt disagree. Thanks. There are so many things to object to these days. Where to begin.
@kylegriffin1 It‚Äôs kind of like all the conservative women on Fox. They want to be viewed as smart, tough, journalists with integrity. But they look the other way and tolerate the abusive environment they operate in. It‚Äôs hard to have much empathy.
@galinja @jonathantasini What‚Äôs perfectly clear to me is we need to be allies against trump. Having trump in office is the worst case scenario. The schism between Bernie / Hillary supporters contributed to where we are, unfortunately. This kind of thing is so counterproductive.
@joanwalsh @NoraWD I love Joan Walsh and strongly dislike Hewitt. However, having an echo chamber doesn‚Äôt help us. MSNBC and cnn need to invite the conservatives and trump supporters on so that we can be mindful of all points of view.
@jonathantasini Do you realize that neither Clinton is in office or running for office?  Why do people bother fixating on this sort of thing?

@noteabaggers @realDonaldTrump For further evidence of what a low life he is, check out the ‚ÄòEmbedded‚Äô podcast.

@JRubinBlogger @CNNPolitics Is it me - I just can‚Äôt remember a prior administration so totally OBSESSED with opponents and the prior administration. I mean Bush, Clinton, bush, obama Just weren‚Äôt like this. These people are depraved.
@hopedellon @emilynussbaum This makes me physically ill. I‚Äôm ashamed of my country
@ddale8 @IvankaTrump learned from dad. She said @TrumpSoHo_Spa was 60% pre-sold!!  She defrauded those investors, bigly.
One good thing caused by Trump:  His scandal has caused me to become fascinated by Watergate!and political history. Discovered the amazing Slow Burn podcast by @leoncrawl and I‚Äôm rewatching All the President‚Äôs Men. My god-Redford is an amazing actor!  Handsome!
Jim Jordan, Matt Gaetz, Devin Nunes and others have to ask themselves:  Is Trump worth it?  You are trashing the FBI / DOJ and you risk destabilizing the institutions of our democracy.  You threaten our way of life in America. @Jim_Jordan @DevinNunes @mattgaetz
@davidfrum Sorry for your loss. It‚Äôs a terrible tragedy.
@laurabh07712 @LeslieSimone_ Thanks
@melissalvla @tedlieu In case you haven‚Äôt noticed, he‚Äôs trying. We now live essentially under an autocracy. Trump has control of government and is discrediting fbi, doj and free press. It will take time to correct all that‚Äôs happened.
@tedlieu No action on gun safety and PR still suffers.  Love you Lieu!  Very thankful you are my rep in West LA.
@davidryantaylor @Lorenzo_Duartes @CapitaLiszt @suannelqr @SebGorka @realDonaldTrump Sad but true. Well said.
@SebGorka @realDonaldTrump Keeping in mind that Bush 2 essentially created the mortgage crisis and housing bubble. Also the banks were lending to everyone with little regulation. Obama had to clean it all up- stimulus and other measures to save banks and auto industry. Not apples To apples
@RonaldKlain Lol. True enough. #CorkerKickback   Even if he didn‚Äôt know about the last minute change, he‚Äôs lost all credibility due to voting to increase the deficit
@AhmetTurut0 @realDonaldTrump @WhiteHouse Who is this?
@Lin_Manuel @VAMNit You two are so adorable
@ComfortablySmug Who did you vote for (duh)
@roboticpressure @RepAdamSchiff What you mean to say is Schiff will put others in jail.  Schiff is a hero.
@about_scout @funder Lol. They are such fools. Maybe this investigation will put the issue to rest once and for all.
@hoskins_lori @hxernst @funder Start a hashtag #DonaldPutin
@funder @DisavowTrump16 Agreed but isn‚Äôt the focus tying approval of the deal with Clinton foundation donations and large speech fees?  Debunked as well but just trying to look at the nature of their claims.
@FoxNews @IvankaTrump Can she really be this clueless?  And fox promotes this clip?  Do they think WE are clueless?
@davidsirota @SenBobCorker @kilmeade I think it was a perfectly professional, respectful and appropriate interview by wolf blitzer.   If people think it was out of bounds, then our society has taken a dangerous turn.
@pdacosta @gabriel_zucman someone needs to investigate Ross. Lots of smoke on him , maybe fire.
@PressSec @realDonaldTrump My taxes in California are going up. This is unfair. You are lying about a big tax cut.  But then you lie constantly. Does your god approve of lying?
@LeslieSimone_ What does ‚Äúshadowbanned‚Äù mean ?
@SenatorTimScott Taxes for blue states are going up due to caps on deductions. How is that a big, beautiful tax cut?!  My tax rate stays the same. Thanks a lot senator. You may have had a hand in the bill, but trump does use people as props frequently. You‚Äôve gotten in bed w/a bad dude.
@ASlavitt hi, can you please answer a healthcare question?  Prior to the ACA, what happened if a person went to the ER w/out insurance?  Did the state pay for the cost of care?  What about a chronic illness? Just trying to get more educated as to what will happen w/out ACA. Tx

@amandacarpenter Amanda, you are way too smart to read too much into these couple of stories, right?  The verdict will not be in on the #TaxScamBill for years. You know that, right?  I thought you‚Äôd come  to your senses like 18 months ago. Maybe not.
@chesse47 @DavidMDrucker @VP I learned a new word for this and it fits so well:  obsequious. It‚Äôs nauseating
@IvankaTrump @HouseGOP @SenateGOP For many in blue states our taxes are going up due to limits on deductions. You are punishing people in blue states making over $250k
I hope they get a lot of pictures of the GOP celebrating its appalling #TaxScamBill. Backslapping and smug grins. Everyone who voted for it will pay the price in their next election.  #NeverEverTrustaRepublican
@realDonaldTrump Then how come my taxes in CA are going up??
Perfect description of Trump‚Äôs cabinet, especially Carson, as well as Pence. It‚Äôs gross. Obama was brilliant and he never expected or encouraged this disgusting behavior.  It says a lot about trump that he requires such affirmation from his team. https://t.co/bdMBuft28L
Ben Carson uses his prayer to God as a chance to bash Democrats and political enemies???  To praise Dear Leader?  These people are insane. Using religion as a political weapon. I‚Äôm disgusted.
Naturally @realDonaldTrump is gloating about his #TaxScam. He‚Äôs not an elegant winner. Also doesn‚Äôt even know the name of his damn bill. And by the way blue states are getting an increase you dotard!  Not a GIANT Christmas gift tax cut.
@ScottJenningsKY Scott are you joking or serious?
If you want to give ‚Äúbusinesses‚Äù a tax cut, how come the cut for large corporations is SO MUCH bigger than the cut for small businesses?  The tax bill is just corrupt and unfair on all levels. If only trump supporters would read and do research, they‚Äôd see it‚Äôs a #TaxScamBill

@WereRoach @trish_regan @bethduffbrown @ShepNewsTeam Yes, agree on Shep.
@trish_regan @bethduffbrown Let‚Äôs not get carried away ( best and most honest is laughable). Thank you for being truthful about carried interest. That‚Äôs as far as I‚Äôll go.
@bethduffbrown @trish_regan Same. I‚Äôm literally shocked to hear a Fox News anchor criticizing the corrupt tax bill. She‚Äôll surely be fired soon.
@Karoli @realDonaldTrump Wow. I‚Äôm shocked a Fox journalist is speaking the truth. Speaking with passion too.  Wonder how long before they let her go.

@k_ovfefe @joew_80228 @JackPosobiec Are u guys familiar with Watergate? We‚Äôre living through Trump‚Äôs Watergate.

To @nikkihaley  - moving the embassy to Jerusalem is absolutely NOT the will of the American people!!!  You are delusional if you believe your own words. You and trump will have blood on your hands. Shame on you, smiling ear to ear about what you‚Äôve done on #SOTU.
@Dani_L_Sage @Kris_Sacrebleu Classic gaslighting.
@brianstelter @ReliableSources Feel better Brian. We need you!  Thanks to you and CNN for your outstanding journalism.
@leoncrawl My new favorite podcast!!!  Can‚Äôt wait for next episode. Signed up for Slate Plus!  I‚Äôm addicted.
@JordanUhl Not a Star Wars buff. What‚Äôs it mean?
If Trump fires Mueller, I sure hope that Mueller is able to leave behind all the careful research and interview notes/recordings. Hopefully those working with Mueller will not allow Trump to quash the entire investigation.  Mueller‚Äôs replacement could continue?
@CREWcrew He‚Äôs not nearly the billionaire he‚Äôd have us believe he is once you subtract out all the debt!
@3L3V3NTH Next he‚Äôll become a birther and go on Infowars. He‚Äôs unraveling; sad.
@sarahbryan @LindseyGrahamSC @realDonaldTrump Seriously, what the hell happened to this guy?  It‚Äôs EXTREMELY suspicious. Something is up.
@kumailn @nlyonne I can‚Äôt even bring myself to watch it. Twitter should not make that a moment. So depressing and sad. I hope the camera man fed the Poor thing?
@realDonaldTrump Who is this ‚Äúwe‚Äù you always refer to?  My opinions on kneeling and the National anthem are very different from yours.
Jack Kingston doesn‚Äôt believe his own arguments on CNN. you can tell by the look on his face that he feels foolish putting forward such silly arguments (stupid trump talking points). And shouldn‚Äôt he know by now how to pronounce Mueller?
@LindseyGrahamSC He‚Äôs a kook!
@LindseyGrahamSC Funny that Lindsey hasn‚Äôt been screaming about this until now. What changed?
@20committee And I doubt he would have actually paid anyone that amount of money. It was a bait and switch.
@BaroutiLaw And 12 hours later you‚Äôre going after Tom Arnold. Take a look in the mirror before you chastise others over divisiveness
@PamelaGeller Clearly, there is a LOT more to the story, and none of it‚Äôs good.
@SethAbramson Please let us know what we can do. Thanks for doing all of this. It does make a difference
@SusanNow3 @ActorJaimeGomez But but but .... he denies it !!!  Lol. The Republicans are the party with no moral compass. Trump gets away with everything. Total disgrace.
@TomArnold I think you give Leeann way too much credit. And btw it is not inconceivable that a small percentage of #MeToo stories are fake. I tend to believe the women as well but we have to use good judgement. I believe Leeann‚Äôs Case is a hit job built on a grain of truth
@chrislhayes Ouch , eyes are burning. Too much evil in one photo
@brianschatz Good riddance to Rohrabacher of Russia and Issa, regardless of how they vote
@AP I thought nationalists stayed out of the business of other countries. Seems more like he‚Äôs a global bully.
@AnthonyScarramu @SarahPalinUSA Hey Scaramucci- I‚Äôm embarrassed for you. 9 out of 10 commenters/followed  are complete morons. The party of the Dumb. Guys I‚Äôm talking about TODAY!  not history. Today‚Äôs GOP kinda likes KKK.  Today‚Äôs Democrats do not!  I‚Äôm muting this conversation as it is mind numbing.
@AnthonyScarramu @noteabaggers @SarahPalinUSA Seriously , did you get hacked?  Did a  child take over your Twitter?  You‚Äôre devolving into Bannon / Miller territory.  I gave you credit for being intelligent and decent. I was so so wrong!   Shame on me for giving you benefit of the doubt.
@AnthonyScarramu @noteabaggers @SarahPalinUSA Dude - just ask a Democrat!  We despise the KKK.  I‚Äôm shocked you are struggling with this concept.
@AnthonyScarramu @SarahPalinUSA I challenge you to document the ways in which the Democratic Party of TODAY is like the KKK of TODAY.  Get it?  you people are ridiculous. No intellectual discourse whatsoever. Good riddance Scarramucci. You are way more toxic than I feared.  Trump Troll, ruining America.
@AnthonyScarramu @SarahPalinUSA I sure am glad your time in the White House didn‚Äôt last long. You were so impressive and balanced in that first press conference. But now you prove yourself to be a sycophantic troll like the rest. Thought you were an adult In the room but nah.
@pacelattin Lock him up!!
@AnthonyScarramu @SarahPalinUSA Thanks for the history lesson. It‚Äôs pointless to refer to details from so long ago. The Democratic Party of TODAY is clearly anti-KKK, while trump and his supporters seem to be sympathetic to (or fully supportive of) such hate groups.  things change over time; childish argument.
@JuddLegum Unfollowed!  He‚Äôs dead to me now
@AnthonyScarramu @SarahPalinUSA Are you seriously suggesting the Democrats have something in common with the KKK?  In an open and free democracy, it is perfectly appropriate (and helpful) for people of all stripes to call out a failed administration. I applaud Obama for letting the world know trump is nuts.
@bigskyAnne @stuffjuliesays üò¢üò∞‚òπÔ∏è
@bigskyAnne @stuffjuliesays Thanks for posting, fantastic photo. Love him so much.
@FoxNews @TomiLahren @SenWarren Her grandparents told her of her heritage. Didn‚Äôt realize she needed dna  testing to prove it. She‚Äôs not known to be a liar, unlike Liar in chief.
@FoxNews @TomiLahren @SenWarren She‚Äôs a joke. Fox will get bored of her soon and because she has no substance, just rants, she‚Äôll be washed up at 23.
@krassenstein Imagine if Gloria Allred brings down Trump!!  Geeze can‚Äôt make this stuff up.
@JoyAnnReid @NBCOUT Love you Joy. Apology accepted. Your heart was in the right place.
@juliettekayyem To me it‚Äôs not so surprising. I knew something was up during the hurricanes. He speaks of Trump like a Dear Leader and becomes enraged when anyone criticizes Trump. Bossert=sycophant Trump koolaid drinker.
Why on earth would anyone believe Trump about Flynn or whether he wrote a tweet?  The man has told more than 1,000 documented lies over the past year. People who still support him are living in an alternate universe.
Anyone who‚Äôs not outraged by this is straight up stupid or benefitting from the corruption.  https://t.co/9iz2Z5EINH
@latimes At least this whole probe has revealed how corrupt business as usual is in DC - manafort/Flynn tax evasion and money laundering.
@latimes That‚Äôs been my question all along!!
@mmurraypolitics @donnabrazile And it‚Äôs a preamble to cutting social security/ Medicare, which trump said he wouldn‚Äôt do. Liars.
@SmartMouth If you‚Äôve affiliated with Bill O‚ÄôReilly, get ready for a backlash
@PressSec @realDonaldTrump If running at full potential, why do they feel the tax bill is needed?
@DeanHeller @thegarance Lol. 550 likes but 3,500 negative comments!!!  You Republican senators are clueless and in for a rude awakening!!
@3L3V3NTH Abacus:  Small Enough to Jail. You‚Äôll hate Cy Vance even more after watching.
@marcorubio How‚Äôs it feel to be played like the rest of us?
The surprising winner in this Trumpsterfuck is Chris Christie. He was pushed out (against his will) by Kushner before he had a chance to get mixed up in the collusion. He‚Äôs been awfully quiet lately, probably counting his lucky stars.
@will_c_fischer @realDonaldTrump @jaredkushner @IvankaTrump @DonaldJTrumpJr @EricTrump You forgot @FLOTUS. She‚Äôs in the background trying not to smile with delight. She‚Äôs almost free!!!
@zipillinois @BradMossEsq Well said and agree 1,000%. Fake news from Russia tipped the scales, along with Wikileaks and Comey timing.
@marcorubio @UCF_Football Why bother tweet this crap!!  Your constituents and most Americans despise what you‚Äôve done as a senator!  Get ready for the Blue Wave. The sad part is many of us thought you were one of the very FEW good ones!
@marcorubio Senator- read the comments right here from your constituents and get a freaking clue!!!  Save your bible stuff for church.
@rabiasquared Security may have been an issue but there was only one person who chose to plow a car into a crowd at high speed. Please don‚Äôt lose sight of this point. Nothing else really matters at the end of the day.
@cobystarr @SuzanneKelleher @RWPUSA SCOTUS- if there is any decency left in the world this will not happen. I would have to move to another country.
@RWPUSA He‚Äôs lost ALL credibility, forever. Totally irredeemable
@jonfavs And he described the whole thing to Lester Holt in a televised interview!!!!!  LOLOLOL
@funder We need Doug Jones to win!  This is essential for the future of our country.
@synthgem @realDonaldTrump That has been my thought all along!  Co-defense agreement blew up as soon as we heard Trump was not helping with Flynn legal bills. If Trump‚Äôs penny pinching is the reason for his own downfall- I love it!!
In today‚Äôs high tech / social media era, I think Twitter feeds are the equivalent of ‚Äúcall yourCongress people‚Äù. It‚Äôs faster and easier to express your opinion for all to see and voicemail doesn‚Äôt get full. Congress should shift to Twitter rather than tracking constituent calls.
@SenJohnMcCain @BrookingsInst In my household today, you are being the opposite of ‚Äúhonored‚Äù. I hope paying off your donors will be worth destroying your legacy.
@ryanjreilly @AkbarSAhmed What we don‚Äôt know is how much Flynn actually knows and whether he will truly spill it all. He could be playing Mueller.
@ryanjreilly @AkbarSAhmed Outrageous!!!!
@Shakespeare527 @Dasrht @clairecmc The Democrats should walk out of the vote in protest, but that won‚Äôt happen.
@Dasrht @clairecmc Claire is great but the fight is over. The donors have won. Our only weapon is to vote out all the politicians working against interests of their constituents
@yashar They are proving that they only serve donors. Throw the dirty ones out in both parties!!
@SavannahGuthrie Sorry but I feel Savannah was WAY to kind to Matt when making the big announcement. How about leading with empathy for VICTIMS?  She must not have understood the extent of the behavior.
@jimsciutto I hope Mueller can bring additional charges against Flynn after he‚Äôs served his purpose. He needs to be locked up. Karma comes at you quickly sometimes
@jimsciutto So much winning!!!  LOLOL
@jimsciutto Can‚Äôt they bring more charges later? Bi certainly hope so.
Will the people who contributed to Flynn‚Äôs defense fund want their money back when they realize Flynn is providing the goods on Trump and those in Trump‚Äôs orbit?
@AJDelgado13 Team trump shows its true colors - bailing on you. Yet you remain loyal.  Stupefying. As a woman, I support you, but can‚Äôt resist pointing out how loathsome your prior teammates are.
@AlanDersh @HeerJeet @jjz1600 @NomikiKonst @JesseFFerguson LOLOLOLOL !!!   Thanks for the laugh. You no longer get to claim to be a liberal Democrat. That ship has sailed for you (at least in the eyes of decent Americans)
@mtaibbi No sure @mtaibbi is the best source for advice on personal matters
@Alt_Spicerlies @ninaandtito @BetsyDeVosED Also of Pizzagate fame. Prince pushed that conspiracy theory and gave it legs.
@waltshaub So what will happen?  Will she simply be fired?  She‚Äôll probably go work on Fox.
@Mikel_Jollett And they are removing AMT, which was most of the tax Trump paid. He‚Äôs flat out lying. How can they not get it.
@GeraldoRivera @MLauer Matt is married - why is he courting anyone??
@GeraldoRivera @MLauer Look up the Better Midler stories. Gerry will be out as well, soon.
@JeffFlake That‚Äôs the best job can do?  Highly inappropriate???  Do your job. He‚Äôs a mad man and congress needs to put a stop to this madness. I‚Äôm outraged that with few exceptions, Congress is allowing this disaster unchecked . Ruining America, you are complicit. Thanks Jeff for nothing
@tinatbh Thank you for your tweets. They cheer me up and give me a laugh when I need it because living in Trump Land on twitter is crushing my soul.
@ActuallyNPH @TheBandsVisit I loved it but knew right away it was awesome. The visual impact in the open was impressive. The Israeli sarcasm/blah blah blah when we see the leading lady was so clever and interesting.   It‚Äôs my favorite show this year by a mile.  Heavenly songs like Answer me =captivating.
@Lawrence Great WTF talk. Love you, love him.  Marc‚Äôs long form interviews make me feel like I‚Äôm part of the conversation. Good stuff Lawrence.
@EdKrassen It‚Äôs hopeless. It feels sometimes like we are living in two different worlds. I want off the crazy planet
@IvankaTrump @realDonaldTrump @StateDept The Trump kids swindled the Trump SoHo buyers. Completely falsified sales numbers. Cy Vance was bribed to look the other way. Trump kids should have been indicted. Read up on this scandal. Shameful. There is proof.
@Byronditto @GodStinks @HillaryClinton @ManMet80 Do you understand how math works?  Regardless of your dumb red map, she got more f@cking votes!!
@Lin_Manuel @23andMe You cracked me up on Curb tonight. Great job Lin!  Love you.
@ManhattanDA Yikes all these stories about Trump SoHo are not painting you in a positive light. I think there‚Äôs going to be a price to pay for the miscarriage of justice.
Putting Leeann Tweetum aside, the allegations against Senator Franken are basically the same as those against President H.W. Bush.  I scratch my head about the unequal public responses to these two stories
@IngrahamAngle @DonaldJTrumpJr @realDonaldTrump Seriously, what‚Äôs the big deal about taping a show?  I couldn‚Äôt care less. And to equate this with the Trump admin (worst in American history) is just ridiculous.
@TeaPainUSA I‚Äôll bet he timed this just right - just prior to interviews with Hope Hicks, Stephen Miller, etc.  The timing on Flynn may lead to more truthful responses. #ImGratefulForMueller
@diannaeanderson @emmykegler I‚Äôm hoping that there is eventually a noticeable impact on Church attendance and donations. I have to believe that many Americans will come to their senses and find fault in what their church leaders are saying.
@AprilDRyan PLEASE make this your FIRST question in the next press briefing!
@AprilDRyan Love you April!!  ‚ù§Ô∏è
@RVAwonk @SLSmith000 What about Palin and Coulter?  They‚Äôre feeling left out.
@RVAwonk @SLSmith000 My eyes hurt
@kathymc703 @jbarro I also feel that information needs to be made public regarding congressional sexual harassment cases settled with taxpayer money. I‚Äôd venture to guess those claims again are worse than the  Franken allegations. Names and misdeeds need to be revealed.
@Charmed0504 @SecondLady @POTUS And Ivana said she‚Äôs the First Lady too!  So Pencey would be #4
@kathymc703 @jbarro Allegations against Trump are far, far worse. I personally don‚Äôt think the Franken allegations even come close to warranting resignation.
@AndreaWNYC Terrific article in the New Yorker (10/4/17). Maddening that the case was dropped.
@talter @larrywilmore @DaveedDiggs Great talk. Love both of you guys. Daveed as Laf/Jeff was an absolute revelation. It is so nice to spend time listening to two genuinely decent men in the sea of trash that is our world today. Thanks
@AshleyRParker @NewYorker @wpjenna Another clarification- April Ryan is also a CNN contributor.
@AshleyRParker @NewYorker @wpjenna I was very bothered by that.  These professional journalists were REQUIRED to share a little story before asking a question? Frankly very surprised so many played along.  It‚Äôs so typical of this admin.
@AynRandPaulRyan @Twitter @Cernovich He‚Äôs an absolute monster. Mike Flynn jr retweets him a lot. Lovely guys.
@susanswann99 @diealready1226 @HillaryClinton I agree with you. My heart breaks for what could‚Äôve been.
@chrislhayes Let‚Äôs give Alabama a chance. They may decide to show America that they want to be on the right side of history. I‚Äôm going to try and stay optimistic. And if Franken and others must face ethics investigations, maybe that will force a similar  investigation into DT (which is good!)
@realDonaldTrump Are you aware California is in America?  We are getting screwed in your bloody tax bill!
@PressSec requiring journalists to say what they are thankful for sure smells like Trump requiring cabinet members to praise him. This whole admin acts like a dictatorship.  I don‚Äôt find Sarah at all charming. Journos should feel disrespected.
@notthefakeSVP You‚Äôre my new hero. And I don‚Äôt even follow sports!  Keep speaking up!  Thank you
@WayneRoot @espn Scott van pelt is my new hero!  I love that line - so many ARE beyond hope.
@latimes Thanks. This is one of the best articles I‚Äôve read as far as explaining, in basic and unbiased terms, why this tax bill is so truly horrific.
@greta Yes, Twitter is an ugly place. But I do hope you see it, in part, as a barometer of American sentiment. We all have different opinions of course, but America has opened up its eyes Re Trump. U applauding him for undoing a very wrong deed doesn‚Äôt help. He‚Äôs a sick man hurting usa.
@CheriJacobus @AltmanErin @GretchenCarlson @MariaBartiromo But she‚Äôs perfect for the propaganda machine known as Fox News. I can‚Äôt imagine anyone will view her as a legitimate journalist again, but she has job security at Fox.
@realDonaldTrump I hope Jeff Flake decides to run against you in 2020. You‚Äôre not half the man he is. You are a disgrace and an embarrassment.
@annamayzing1 @reveal @RollingStone @theIFUND What does one have to do with the other?  Did you bother listening to the podcast?  The place doesn‚Äôt even have a basement. They trace through the entire history of the story to show that it was truly fake news.
@reveal @RollingStone @theIFUND Fantastic episode. Eric Prince owes Hilary a big apology.
I think Eric Prince owes Hilary Clinton an apology.... scary to think that some of the most powerful Americans (defense contractors no less)  are no better than run of the mill conspiracy theorists... https://t.co/jqUoHezYVP
@JoyAnnReid @InSpiteOfTrump Besides the sentiment of it being awful, the part about shoplifting not being a big deal is worded horribly!  He is the worst writer/tweeter.
@MichaelRCaputo @mcbyrne You belittled the ‚ÄúMe Too Stuff‚Äù on CNN. Way to show some moral leadership. You people are absolutely vile. America deserves better. I have zero sympathy for you regarding legal bills. Time to deal with the consequences of aligning yourself with trash.
@mf36 @GovernorKayIvey In states where they vote based on culture (white Christianity), guns and anti- immigrants, and where they choose to ignore pedophilia, the percentage of kids in college is well below the national average. You give them way too much credit. #BoycottAlabama
@brianstelter @MariaBartiromo She‚Äôs lost her damn mind. It‚Äôs contagious these days
@Mediaite No allegations????  Hello??  Is she delusional?  What‚Äôs happened to her?
@lauravigilante @MariaBartiromo @brianstelter @yashar @Mediaite Maria seems to have a schoolgirl crush on trump. It‚Äôs gross. Lost all respect for her.
@howellgirl1 @Peace4all17 @Rosie @SteveScalise With all due respect they are NOT all alike!  Do the math, do some research. If you think they are all alike, I feel that you are misinformed. Biggest problem in America is people voting against their own interests due to dog whistles a cultural Identity.
@TheOnlyKAVIN And silent on his own accusations!!!!!
@Peace4all17 @howellgirl1 @Rosie @SteveScalise Hey @howellgirl1 - please do your homework and base it on FACTS- not blindly following a politician. This is truly the biggest transfer of wealth in history to the top 1% and corporations. Tax hikes for the rest of us are baked in. It‚Äôs a massive scam.  Bait &amp; switch, seriously.
@KFILE Thank you @KFILE !! Keep the awesome work. America needs you and thanks you
@maydaymindy9 Agreed. His signature is horrible too. No style at all.
@shannonrwatts Good grief, what‚Äôs with all the silly birthday talk!!
@shannonrwatts Or ‚ÄúAgain...‚Äù
@latimes We need them now. Put up or lose seat. California is biggest loser in tax bill and would force us to subsidize other states. This is outrageous.
@marthamaccallum I do wish they would ease up on the lip gloss at Fox. It‚Äôs very distracting. I just want to take a tissue and wipe it away. Don‚Äôt see that party girl look on other stations.  Believe me the Trumpians spread extraordinarily amounts of hate constantly. I just no longer care.
@annalangthorn Hats off to you Anna!  Nice job on Rachel‚Äôs show
@waltshaub @RepDonBeyer It‚Äôs so sad, all I can do is laugh these days. The country is on a very scary path. Please keep fighting for us @waltshaub
One of the saddest things about the rise of Trump for me is that the American flag no longer represents freedom and peace. It represents the MAGA movement- America‚Äôs dark underbelly. Every time I see a üá∫üá∏ on twitter, I know I‚Äôll be hearing some toxic fake news and propaganda.
@marthamaccallum Plus you work with a station full of predators!  If you want respect and to be a real journalist, resign!  You are complicit in ruining America and repressing females in the workplace. I know I‚Äôll get a ton of hate but I call it like I see it.
@marthamaccallum Every time I tune in the women are wearing prom dresses , big hair and pounds of makeup. They are spewing toxic propaganda. You Fox viewers should, just for an experiment, try another station to see the difference. Fox chooses not to even cover real news. Sad.
@PapaJohns @Mr_Aaron_Jordan Became obvious you are trying something new merely to stop the financial impact of being racists. Not buying all of this. It won‚Äôt work.
@realDonaldTrump @foxandfriends Are you directing them to air your propaganda?  Wow. They are officially Trump TV.
@RexHuppke ‚ÄúHas‚Äù arrived?  Wtf?  Shouldn‚Äôt they have been there immediately?  He‚Äôs totally off his meds. Wrong massacre you dotard.
@AngrierWHStaff He took down the Keurig / mold article. He really stands up for his principles!  Lol
@ShepNewsTeam This is really not that complicated. Thanks Shep!  Funny that Judge Jeanine says that somehow this deal will harm cancer patients like her who need scans. Wtf???  She‚Äôs out to lunch. Any way to build fear and misinformation.  Infowars =Fox News
@waltshaub Nice quote regarding your work but considering the source, these are empty words
@mitchellvii @VictoriaPylant You are all a bunch of trolls.  You‚Äôre ruining America. Grow up.
@DonaldJTrumpJr You are an absolute troll. Chelsea Clinton would never behave in such a toxic and undignified manner. You‚Äôre turning us into a banana republic!  The truth will come out and America will soon know all about your corruption.
@WilDonnelly I will celebrate with great pleasure when Issa loses his seat.
@davidaxelrod Gino‚Äôs East and Lou Malnati‚Äôs rule!!! So much more complex than NY thin crust.
@DavidYazbek I just loved this show so much. Can‚Äôt wait for the cast recording. I‚Äôll see it again when next in NYC. Thank you for this wonderful and unique piece of art.
@igorvolsky Maybe they have a disqualifying impairment such as dementia.  This excuse is pure BS.
@ProudResister Oh lord what could‚Äôve been.... üò¢
@EagleEdMartin @andersoncooper Not one positive comment ed. You are the WORST that the GOP has to offer.  You blindly try to defend crooks, pedos and racists.  The good will overcome in time.
@pacelattin He alone can solve all our problems LOLOLOLOL.  just like coal- he addresses problems of today with solutions from the past. Nothing he touches as POTUS succeeds.
@seanhannity @DineshDSouza Fox News will be pleased to see you slandering an advertiser (on Fox although not on your show). Why is it that most Trump supporters are childish and toxic?
@david_conn This is a massive story and it‚Äôs just not getting a reaction from the masses. Fascinating
@mmcintire @soledadobrien Mike - I just saw the Vice episode on The Paradise Papers. Hats off to you and all the others. The press is perhaps our greatest weapon against corruption and wealth inequality. Thank you!  Look forward to reading and digging deeper.
@3L3V3NTH Geeze the Paradise Papers story on Vice / HBO is disturbing. Wealth inequality is stunning. Wilbur Ross needs to resign.
@edhenry We know that you aren‚Äôt THAT Ed Henry, but you do work for Fox, and that‚Äôs pretty bad too (to a lesser degree). You guys push propaganda for the president and don‚Äôt report on actual news. Bad for truth in America.
@john_burris @shannonrwatts She‚Äôs just evil personified. Truly toxic
@EdKrassen You mean ‚Äúauthor‚Äú.
@cmclymer This brings real tears to my eyes. The man is a hero to me. We were lucky to have him.
@SamSanderson123 @Jeremy10036 @donnabrazile Someone should check to see if she‚Äôs got a medical condition that‚Äôs causing her to lose her common sense and commit career/reputation suicide.
@SamSanderson123 @Jeremy10036 @donnabrazile She‚Äôs just lost her damn mind completely
@MarcBodnick @MelissaAFrancis Finally a reasonable person with some common sense. These people are sycophants, drinking the Fox koolaid. Melissa is terrible at facilitating reasonable discourse. And she‚Äôs very rude.
@brianstelter @RWitherspoon This is wonder !!  Congrats. Will be watching for sure
@tedlieu @debbiesideris @realDonaldTrump Lol love you Lieu!!
@shannonrwatts @InSpiteOfTrump Who are the two on the left?  Any idea?
@realDonaldTrump 80,000 votes in Just the right places is how you won EC. very misleading to say it was a landslide victory. Your approve/disapprove rates are dismal. #MuellerIsComing
@RepAdamSchiff @realDonaldTrump @POTUS Frankly, anyone who continues to support him is both naive/stupid and un-American.  It‚Äôs not patriotic to do harm to your fellow Americans.
@eugenegu Yes, you might consider legal action for workplace harassment. Unacceptable
@eugenegu Totally gross and unacceptable but I‚Äôm very confused about it (milk from garbage?). Also the chief resident elbowing you...what‚Äôs the story there?  Can you file complaints with hospital?  Just awful.
@KatTimpf Where‚Äôs the quote from Madison?
RT @TomSteyer: Fox News pulled our impeachment ad so they wouldn't upset President Trump. Sign and RT to send a message to Fox News. https:‚Ä¶
@JSwiftTWS Got it now #LOL
@JSwiftTWS Ok good to know. Sorry for jumping to conclusions. Others may see the shorting as a real betrayal of America.
@Amy_Siskind I thoroughly enjoy your tweets. Thank u!
@JSwiftTWS Nah. Market speculation (up or down) is just part of how the capital markets operate. Shorting a stock is perfectly fine &amp; normal. Seriously
@SykesCharlie Please  tell @realDonaldTrump and @GOP
RT @funder: .@SpeakerRyan-You need to pass an #AssaultWeaponsBan. Everyone who RT‚Äôs agrees. You have the opportunity to do something good.‚Ä¶
@JillFilipovic Agreed. Military needs to monitor those discharged and with PTSD. there is a LOT we can do short of taking away 2nd amendment
@TheOnion @noclador Nicely done, @TheOnion.  I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve ever seen you get political. I like it!  We (America) are idiots these days. We need gun control
@EsotericCD Also they intercepted a missile that was fired towards the airport. Also kind of a big deal?
@AP Wtf?
@MaxBoot They just rearrange words: thoughts, prayers, devastated, hearts, sadness, shock, love, family, America, etc. words no longer have meaning
@JoyAnnReid @4everNeverTrump @SpeakerRyan Thank you @JoyAnnReid, for being brave and speaking truth to power. We need you now more than ever. Enough!!!!
@ClaraJeffery Not just for Russian baggage but also for position with Cyprus Bank  (and probably other things)
@voicework @luxtine @Twitter I had the same exact thought. Why not?
@ProdMichelle Thanks what time does your show start? Podcasts don‚Äôt measure content by time of Day (they mark minutes between start and finish)
@JoyAnnReid Hi Joy - please watch @JudgeJeanine's segments from tonight on uranium.  The people on Fox seem totally clueless about the facts
@scottienhughes @realDonaldTrump @CNN Looking at this picture, my eyes are burning and I feel nauseous.  Scottie - have you spoken publicly about the predators at Fox?
@scottienhughes @realDonaldTrump @POTUS So what? Are you disappointed? What is there to celebrate? Worst most destructive &amp; embarrassing president in US history. You‚Äôre #complicit
@AbacusMovie @DOCNYCfest Can you please let me know where/how to watch this film at home?  Thanks. Very interested to watch. Available anywhere ON DEMAND?  Thanks
@shannonrwatts And military- grade automatic weapons at that.
@UnimpressedTX @vmsalama @20committee That was my first thought as well. People in glass houses..... the height of hypocrisy.
@Irishladylisa @Thewiseonewon @NBCNews @realDonaldTrump Maybe the majority in the Military are pro-Trump, but Hawaii is STRONGLY anti-Trump, which makes all the photo ops a joke.
@ProdMichelle @CONELRAD6401240 @NationalNOW @RadioHOF @RepWilson @ColorOfChange @Jasmyne @LAWeekly I used to love KFI before the election. Stopped listening unfortunately. I used to find Bill very entertaining.  Hard to feel happy for him
@ProdMichelle @CONELRAD6401240 @NationalNOW @RadioHOF @RepWilson @ColorOfChange @Jasmyne @LAWeekly Please tell us the date and time marker within the podcast thanks
@ProdMichelle @CONELRAD6401240 @NationalNOW @RadioHOF @RepWilson @ColorOfChange @Jasmyne @LAWeekly I‚Äôd like to listen for myself. Pls give podcast date and time marker. Bill was not on air on Thursday, 11/2.
@eugenegu I applaud folks striving to develop services that identify fake news/misinformation as well as those that ‚Äúcertify‚Äù news articles as factual
@eugenegu I wish Twitter could continuously identify and delete bots. Surely Silicon Valley can develop algorithms to do this.
@eugenegu And trump says nothing about this cyberwarfare
@mtaibbi I read Breitbart occasionally to see the propaganda they are pushing and to take their temperature. Very damning article about matt today.
@mtaibbi I hope the Breitbart piece about you is false. It would be tremendously disappointing if true. Surprised u wrote it even if fiction??  Gross
@brianstelter @ReliableSources @KellyannePolls Ask her to please answer questions directly. No more pivots and answering questions with questions. She always ends up lecturing someone.
@brianstelter @ReliableSources @KellyannePolls I love that everyone is onto her little interview tricks. The Conway pivot doesn‚Äôt work anymore. She‚Äôs not fooling anyone with tricks &amp; lies
@deray There should be a special hashtag for these racist scum, like #the32%. The 32% who will blindly support 45 no matter what. Truly deplorable.
@peggyblah @faryl @Mikel_Jollett Points taken. I just have a huge problem with DB wrongly disparaging HRC. facts need to come out so people know what‚Äôs up. Misinformation.
@Mikel_Jollett We really need some clarity and honesty on this from Bernie. Would like Hilary to speak up also.
@RoryOMalley @CW_CrazyXGF @TheCW Love this show, and you!!
@NBCNews I feel sorry for the military members who have to treat trump like some kind of king. They don‚Äôt have a choice. Undeserved
@RepMattGaetz @replouiegohmert @RepAndyBiggsAZ I love that this tweet‚Äôs been up for 8 hours and only has 286 likes.
@ProudResister This political era is full of so many ironies. Such as , trump‚Äôs pursuit of ‚Äúher emails‚Äù will bring him down!  #LockThemUp!
@funder @realDonaldTrump If they replace Sessions, wouldn‚Äôt it be easier to fire Mueller?  I‚Äôm keeping the Long game in mind.
@donnabrazile I think your days of being respected are over. First passing on debate questions, now this. It kills me, but ‚Äúbye‚Äù.  Why Donna?
@ddale8 He‚Äôs attacking the FBI, who does so much to protect us - most of which we aren‚Äôt even aware of.  No one is sacred to him except ivanka.
@AJDelgado13 Tweet deleted. How apropos
@KrisKobach1787 @CLewandowski_ Two peas in a pod. Both corrupt and racist as the day is Long.
@Mikel_Jollett Well said Mike. Could not agree more. Thank you for all that you do.
@biglifejane @TheLeadCNN @GOPLeader @SenMajLdr @SenJohnMcCain Yes for crying out loud!!
@TheValuesVoter @mattklewis Agree completely. I‚Äôm glad that many true conservatives and sane Republicans are starting to speak up publicly. Some (few) have all along...
@mattklewis Matt - I‚Äôm amazed to say I agree with you more and more each day. You‚Äôre a DECENT conservative, among mostly sycophants and sellouts.
@page88 Don‚Äôt recall Flynn being sorry for the chants? (Maybe your comment was sarcasm). Ironic that HRC emails will bring down Trumpians!#LockEmUp!
@ABCPolitics Sarah sanders previously said benefit of $4k per family ?
@donnabrazile Sad to hear you attacking other Dems. You are no longer a force for good. Hope that you leave DNC üòì
@TheBandsVisit I love all of the songs and they have stayed in my head  ever since Saturday night. Need cast recording now!  Lullaby was really beautiful 2
@TheBandsVisit I agree, the music is completely unique. The standout songs for me are Welcome to Nowhere, Answer Me, and the instrumentals (incl post-show)
@LadyYoucan @catscratch79 @BikiniRobotArmy @realDonaldTrump Yep, that‚Äôs the article I read as well. It‚Äôs stupefying
@catscratch79 @BikiniRobotArmy @realDonaldTrump Makes zero sense and in the end Trump is only hurting the coal miners who are best served by retraining in something that won‚Äôt kill them
@catscratch79 @BikiniRobotArmy @realDonaldTrump Obama set aside millions for retraining in natural gas &amp; other industries but people are choosing not to be retrained due to Trump promises
@realDonaldTrump Ok, but what about the Vegas shooter, hmmmm??
@MrMokelly @RepWilson I understand. It must be difficult for someone with your political views (reasonable as they are) to work for KFI. I used to love it-No more
@MarinaHyde @GaleTStrong Each burn on this tweet is better than the last!
@MichaelRCaputo Well that‚Äôs real mature.
@TheBeatWithAri @MichaelRCaputo When it suits them , trumpeteers like to say 29-45 year olds are just inexperienced young lads. Not buying it. Old enough to know better.
@MichaelRCaputo Sad. So undignified. He‚Äôs 100% Trumpian.
@TheBandsVisit I can‚Äôt wait to hear the telephone song towards the end. Something about it - just beautiful.
@DavidYazbek Did I detect a Ben Folds influence in the telephone song and the group song at the end? That‚Äôs what kept running thru my head.
@KatTimpf I think working for Fox News is killing your soul.  You need to wake up and get the hell out of there before it‚Äôs too late for you.
@ChrisCuomo ‚ÄúI love Stephen Miller...‚Äù ?????  Chris, I was shocked to hear you say this during your interview with Caputo. V confused. ??
@radfemfatale Extremely outraged
@MrMokelly Any thoughts about Bill Handel‚Äôs comments regarding @RepWilson ?
@rabiasquared @sassygayrepub SassyGayRepublican is just awful.  If u try explaining something to him in a cogent way, he‚Äôll block you.  Just wants to shock/get attention
@MichelleObama @BarackObama @ObamaFoundation Miss you and B soooooooooo much!!  Love ya!
@AP_Politics @AP I hope this gets a ton of coverage. Total opposite of drain the swamp. All Americans should be outraged. Zinke corrupt as they come.
@WilDonnelly And Manafort‚Äôs $10 million is ill-gotten gain anyway (evaded taxes, did not register as foreign agent, money laundered). He s/n get bail.
@tedlieu @realDonaldTrump He should, given what he claims is an amazing memory
@EdKrassen Does anyone know why they would be sealed?
@AJDelgado13 Give me a break AJ. I know you for some reason are willing to lie for them, not sure why tho.
@eugenegu And she cloaks herself in religiousity, always judging and condemning others while she lies through her teeth for serious offenders
With the Cyprus connection, I‚Äôd very much like to know more about Wilbur Ross‚Äôs role in all of this...
@EdKrassen Lordy I hope to hell you‚Äôre right!!!!
@dueckman123 I‚Äôd be careful about comments like that. Aren‚Äôt you paying attention to what happens when threats like that are made?
@HillaryClinton While it‚Äôs very bad for America, I hope that today gives you a feeling if vindication.  You were so robbed; loved by many.
@stevenmnuchin1 I hope Louise is enjoying another boondoggle on our dime.
@waltshaub Your tweets just get better and better
RT @PuestoLoco: This ad is causing @realDonaldTrump to have a psychotic breakdown.	Don‚Äôt RT if you don‚Äôt want to drive him mad. https://t.c‚Ä¶
@DavidYazbek @YouTube Brilliant, and beautiful!  Looking forward to tomorrow #MuellerTime
@DavidYazbek please release a cast recording. I adored the show last night. So unusual and beautiful, touching. Music has stayed in my head.
@Lin_Manuel @TheBandsVisit @DavidYazbek I just saw it, loved it sooo much!!!  Hypnotizing music. Leading lady is everything!  Must have soundtrack ASAP
@Lawrence @debbiesideris @JoyAnnReid Bravo @JoyAnnReid !!!!!

@LauraLoomer I wish you would do the same.
RT @tonyposnanski: RT if you have no issues with your tax dollars being used for Mueller‚Äôs investigation.
@Leahh70 @sassygayrepub It depends on how far back u look. Now more than ever we have realistic choices. Today most families need 2 incomes so Sassy‚Äôs idea=no go.
@sassygayrepub The world evolves. Men &amp; women are equals!  Tons of women (and men) simply have no interest in kids &amp; traditional life. We have choices now.
@sassygayrepub I seriously think you are just making things up to be provocative and get attention. You are laughing heartily at all the outraged people.
@sassygayrepub https://t.co/zOswfYsu3J
@sassygayrepub How can you support people who literally hate gay people?  Are u self-loathing?  Do u only support R‚Äôs who are pro-LGBTQ?
@JamieOGrady @leighindy And yet she says all of us should pray more often. She sits in judgement of others and claims to be righteous while Lying 4 predator.
@davidfrum We need someone with authority to set the damn record straight on this. Sick and tired of people who don‚Äôt know anything bringing it up.
@AJDelgado13 That‚Äôs a very naive comment. Mountains of evidence suggesting collusion w Russia and obstruction of justice. And I think u know it.
@JesseBudlong @antiSWJ @sassygayrepub Yes he is very judgemental about female physical appearance (and male too). But I‚Äôll take the high road, not stoop to his level. Issues only
@AJDelgado13 I wish I could feel empathy for u, especially since we both care about animals. Your persona was so very toxic on tv. Jason mistreats u tho
@AngrierWHStaff And McCain. Who else?  Must be others.
@JesseBudlong @antiSWJ @sassygayrepub I‚Äôll make fun of his orange spray tan and ridiculously long ties, but not someone‚Äôs weight or physical attributes. Gotta draw the line smwhr
@sassygayrepub If you‚Äôre going to cloak yourself in Christianity and identify so strongly with it, shouldn‚Äôt you practice some of its tenets?  Or nah....?
@realDonaldTrump He even likes fake oil paintings, and claims the one he has is an original
@MichLKosinski Nothing in the Trump world makes sense
@emilysteel Settling with Lis Wiehl for $$$$ sure makes a guy look guilty of SOMETHING. and yet, he‚Äôs the victim?
@ddale8 @casanova_kara What‚Äôs most disturbing is bringing up an unrelated matter to trash and discredit someone. Empty barrel = so insulting. To hell w/these guys
@BestPlckupLines See that wouldn‚Äôt work bc the lady would feel that you are insulting her giant hands.  Other ones are clever tho.
@nubjeauxmon @Flaccofanz05 @EagleEdMartin @ananavarro @angela_rye That happens to me a lot. Others are watching the same segment and reacting the same way.
@EagleEdMartin Ed-you show us all who you are when you smirk and laugh on a panel with @ananavarro and @angela_rye.  No respect. U r not helping #racist
@SykesCharlie Finally some sanity!!!  Well said. (Commenting as a progressive)
@JoyAnnReid @shannonrwatts Insulting to strippers too.
@realDonaldTrump Only 1,900 people voted in this online poll. It is not indicative of how Americans feel.
@gawdz0rz https://t.co/UiAfxS4UlB
@gawdz0rz @CoryBooker I guess it depends on who you ask.
@gawdz0rz @CoryBooker https://t.co/UiAfxS4UlB
@gawdz0rz @CoryBooker Optional. Either way he‚Äôs good.
@chefjoseandres Junior is every bit as toxic as Sr.
RT @TheGoodGodAbove: Do the major news organizations make up fake stories about Trump?		RT for greatest sample size.
@sassygayrepub Most of your tweets are not ‚ÄúChrist-like‚Äù. FYI.
@sassygayrepub Sassy- people can disagree on politics, but attacks based on someone‚Äôs appearance are beyond the pale. You are not a good person. Grow up
@sassygayrepub Do you even pay taxes?
@KatTimpf More evidence that America has millions upon millions of Deplorables being brainwashed by Fox.
@DavidCornDC David please don‚Äôt ever stop. We are also losing focus on gun control, hurricane recovery, trans rights and many other imp issues.
@greenpeeps5 @TheGoodGodAbove Plus, Only 1,900 people voted.
@TheGoodGodAbove That Politico poll was based on 1,900 registered users so not a valid way to measure how Americans truly feel.
@LisWiehl Please tell your story to the public. Women and Americans need for you to do the patriotic thing. Fox enables predators.
@jaketapper @BillOReilly Even if a rape is settled with $$$, I feel the PD should investigate and press charges if warranted. Legal reason not to??
@ashleyswallows @TheDailyEdge @brianstelter from Reliable Sources provided some reasons on his podcast for why this poll should not be relied upon. Small online poll.
@ashleyswallows @TheDailyEdge Per Politico:  The poll was conducted October 12-16, surveying 1,991 registered voters.
@ashleyswallows @TheDailyEdge https://t.co/7HHr5tEX3N
@sassygayrepub Excuse me, just because Bernie has a high income doesn‚Äôt mean he‚Äôs playing anyone!   It‚Äôs quite the opposite.
@deray Kelly brought in the story about fbi building-completely unrelated to Niger just to try and discredit her. That‚Äôs the trump way. Trash enemy
@TheDailyEdge If it‚Äôs all fake news, then how can he put stock in a poll about fake news?
@realDonaldTrump You truly are the Divider In Chief. I‚Äôm so sad for America.  No Pres has ever been so openly against the very ppl he‚Äôs supposed to serve.
@smerconish U R being a bit naive. Despite her claim, it was very insensitive, shld have known better. Low school spirit=good life lesson.
@chrislhayes To my surprise, I liked General Kelly until the Wilson business. He‚Äôs lost me and now he‚Äôs just as bad as trump. Trashing Wilson=deflecting
@chrislhayes As 45 would said ‚ÄúHe knew what he (Kelly) signed up for‚Äù.
@MariaBartiromo @POTUS @realDonaldTrump @SundayFutures @FoxNews We‚Äôre already reading excerpts from the interview. He‚Äôs off his meds again. Your propaganda is enabling an incompetent and destructive admin
@AlanDersh I miss the days when @AlanDersh was a decent human and on the right side of history. Why trash your reputation for 45?
@rmayemsinger Good grief we are doomed. How did Americans get so dumb?  I blame video games, for one.
@sassygayrepub They are dying in the streets of Puerto Rico.  You won‚Äôt die hers due to the safety net Trump wants to take away.
@brianstelter @TheDailyEdge @TomiLahren She‚Äôs trying to discredit the protesters and clearly doing a poor job. That‚Äôs the best she could come up with?  She‚Äôs toxic anyway.
@Amy_Siskind @carrol_ostrum Also please get back to gun control (after PR coverage).
@realDonaldTrump @nikkihaley People say they serve for the sake of the country - but not because they agree with Trump. Sadly, their careers will be toast in the end.
@tedlieu @POTUS Seriously, does it get any worse?  An orphanage about to experience death from lack of water?  You couldn‚Äôt make this up.
@SenKamalaHarris @stuffjuliesays Couldn‚Äôt agree more. Was just thinking that.
@funder @Gigitrog Wishful thinking, unfortunately. I will rejoice for a whole year if that ever happens.
@JOEL9ONE @awhitworth77 I‚Äôve never before followed a football player. But I‚Äôm so impressed by what you‚Äôve done. Good on you Chris.
@realDonaldTrump We‚Äôre in a bubble. You own it when it bursts.
But really, this sounds EXACTLY like something our dotard moron Pres would say:  ‚ÄúHe knew what he signed up for.....‚Äù. It‚Äôs not a stretch.
@TheDailyEdge That clip is so awkward and weird that I can‚Äôt bear to rewatch it. These people are truly dysfunctional.
@davidfrum Agree with all the others. The Mo Gov is just another version of Trump. David - please rethink who makes you proud.
@jaketapper @Exposingfrauds7 Good on you Jake!  Don‚Äôt let O‚ÄôReilly get away with that. Thank you for all that you do to bring us the truth.
@JoyAnnReid @PolitiSass I‚Äôve been wondering the same thing since news broke. Crickets.
@MikeSacksEsq It all needs precision and clarification- % of gdp or not, corporate/personal/both, and whether or not ‚Äúdeveloped‚Äù countries. Inaccurate.
@MikeSacksEsq I thought the whole point of this is to distinguish between corporate and personal tax rates. Highest on corporate but NOT personal.
@KrisVanh0use @sassygayrepub @jimmykimmel @andersoncooper @MSNBC I am very up to speed, based on many credible sources, about pence/trump. Enjoy your racist, fascist, homophobic admin. Freedom of speech.

@KrisVanh0use @sassygayrepub I don‚Äôt have to like him but I have the freedom to speak against him, shine a light on his shameful views, and work to prevent reelection.
@KrisVanh0use @sassygayrepub Indeed.  However, when a leader of our country has abhorrent views, which are counter to freedom and protection of Americans, why elect him?
@Lawrence @JillWineBanks @realDonaldTrump Then let‚Äôs keep asking him, over and over. Good grief - this has been a painful year / nightmare
@KrisVanh0use @sassygayrepub Do some research on pence‚Äôs views on LGBT AMERICANS.  Many have their heads in the sand. Willful ignorance.
@KrisVanh0use @sassygayrepub Live and let live does not include hanging and conversion therapy. Pence is an enemy of the üè≥Ô∏è‚Äçüåà community.
@sassygayrepub To truly get ahead people need to go to school or learn a skill so that they have a minimum wage job for a year at the most.
@michaelianblack Love you michael but bringing this up is not necessary or helpful. Good liberals are not trying to cover up BC past; it‚Äôs just not= HW
@michaelianblack BC‚Äôs past with those women is ugly but  there is just no equivalency with HW or Cosby. A lot of he said/she said and ppl trying to profit.
@sassygayrepub Wait, your a pizza delivery guy, right?  Hmmmmm.....
@marcellalaluna @rmayemsinger I‚Äôve never once heard him embrace Muslims, atheists or non-Christians. He only serves and represents his base. So un-democratic.
@rmayemsinger He‚Äôs just trying to divide us and stir up his base.  Loves getting others exercised. Divider in chief.

@JacobAWohl @realDonaldTrump You say that like it‚Äôs a good thing. Get back on your meds, dude!  Also bring back the cart &amp; buggy for transportation!
@JonBershad Very enjoyable, clever read. Love The Peanuts. Times were so much simpler when I was young and discovering Charlie Brown.
@sassygayrepub You are so black and white about sexuality, using SWEEPING generalizations. Don‚Äôt you know that‚Äôs how racism works?  R u racist too?
@NanHayworth @KennedyNation @FoxBusiness How can you STILL defend trump?  Can‚Äôt you see how unfit he is?  Liar, narcissistic, unstudied, corrupt, you name it. Shame on YOU!
@sassygayrepub Ever ask yourself why most people hold repubs and conservatives in such low regard?
@sassygayrepub Beginning to think this is a‚Äùfake‚Äù account. You can‚Äôt really be young and gay and have these beliefs. If it‚Äôs not fake, then it‚Äôs sad.
@sassygayrepub Why should marriage anything else be different for same sex couples?  Makes no sense and infringes on Human rights.
@SethAbramson This is significant. However, lots of big things have happened including high profile people speaking against trump. And yet, no change yet.
@KellyannePolls Kellyanne- get a life. We know trump won, but we‚Äôll never respect or admire him. It‚Äôs sad that all you seem to do is knock enemies. Toxic!

@chucktodd @RonMott Love u chuck but u were way 2 easy on @stevenmnuchin1.  It‚Äôs not ‚Äúfrustrating‚Äú to not have power. Rather, ppl are DYING for medical reasons.
@AndreBauerSC You bring shame to your family.  I feel so sorry for your kids and future grandkids for the deep shame they will feel thanks to you.
@AndreBauerSC Why would u post that? You are stoking the flames, just like 45. History is watching you @AndreBauerSC. It won‚Äôt be kind.
@AndreBauerSC Funny thing is how similar this message is to Trump‚Äôs conversation with Stern. Looked the other way, laughed, while an old man falls/bleeds
@SLandinSoCal Are U insane?  She has said over and over it‚Äôs about saving lives. The death toll will be substantial and then maybe u will have compassion.
@SLandinSoCal It proves the point that PR needs mainland help with distribution. I don‚Äôt understand why so many Trump supporters don‚Äôt get that.
@tonyschwartz Tony - I have great respect &amp; admiration for you. Did u move to Europe?  Do u now feel safe?  Trump is a monster.
@sassygayrepub Seriously out of your depth. Stick to cheeseburgers and your other silly tweets. Understanding of Israel is beyond you.
@SusanSarandon @amnestyusa Serious question. How can celebrities like @SusanSarandon stay on twitter when 95% of the comments are horrible?  Delete your account.

@mattbelknap He‚Äôs proved he really can shoot someone in the middle of 5th avenue and not lose votes. Disgusting
@Cernovich You are human garbage. Truly evil. A cancer on America.
@Laurenbh @TheRickWilson Sadly- as bad as 45 is, many of his supporters are like-minded. The Trump era has caused USA to look in the mirror. :(  very depressing
@yashar @AndreBauerSC Thank you, could not agree more. I agree we need to hear all sides but surely CNN has to fire those who hit rock bottom indecency
@brianstelter @IvanCNN Thank you @brianstelter , you are a journalism hero. I‚Äôve never been so depressed/ashamed about America

@marcorubio @fema @DeptofDefense If you stand up for Trump now, after what he has said this morning, then you are just as bad as him. Speak up now, impeach or regret it.
@Lin_Manuel @realDonaldTrump Good on you Lin. Thank you for your bravery and speaking out. We need more high profile people to do it. Prayers to PR.
@AndreBauerSC Your great argument against him being a racist: he‚Äôs your president too, get used to it!  What is CNN even paying you for? U make USA worse
@AndreBauerSC Your comments on CNN - you‚Äôre just as bad as 45. Cruel and out of touch. Racist. With a huge grin on your face. How do u sleep at night?
@Dimafadma @morningmika @JoeNBC She‚Äôs speaking up now, and I give her tremendous credit for that.  Go scream  at Susan Sarandon, jill stein and Bernie supporters.

@sassygayrepub Point is, the world changes and evolves. It‚Äôs juvenile to point out the faults of any party  many decades ago. It‚Äôs just not same party.
@sassygayrepub To point this out is just a deflection &amp; pointless waste of energy and focus. Your ancestors owned slaves. Do u focus on this also?  No
@sassygayrepub Dude, past is the past.  We focus on the world TODAY. Most Dems weren‚Äôt alive when the KKK was involved w/the party.  Why focus on this?
@MarkDice @realDonaldTrump So you don‚Äôt even try to sugar-coat your racism?  You are just totally out and proud of it. How did you get this way?  I‚Äôm sad for you üòì

@TonjaWalker You are making it worse for yourself by adding more comments and playing the victim. Might be best to delete account or sit back, reflect
@TonjaWalker U seem to mean well but are out of touch with non-racist society. Kneeling is NOT about disrespect for flag. It‚Äôs abt racial inequality.

@BarackObama Thank you Sir. Love you. Have donated to multiple organizations including this one. I cry looking at @PeteSouza44 photos üò∞
@charlescwcooke We could go tit for tat posting news articles but the situation is dire and the response has been ineffective and people are suffering.

@kategant7 @TomBossert45 @Scavino45 @POTUS @realDonaldTrump @FEMA_Brock @GovernorMapp @FEMAespanol @femaregion2 @C_C_Krebs @fema @DHSgov If U actually think response to Puerto Rican devastation has been good, then you are clearly in a bubble. It will go down worse than Katrina
@kyledcheney @maggieNYT @nytimes Where is Jason Chaffetz on this?  Unless he is a gigantic hypocrite, he‚Äôd better be calling for indictments.
@TomBossert45 @Scavino45 @POTUS @realDonaldTrump @FEMA_Brock @GovernorMapp @FEMAespanol @femaregion2 @C_C_Krebs @fema @DHSgov I can‚Äôt believe this tweet only has 134 likes after 10.5 hours. Sir, stop applauding yourselves and try actually doing something to help.
@chrislhayes @ddale8 And he defaulted on most of his casino junk bonds. A hypocrite wagging his finger at Puerto Rico. How can he think he‚Äôs comforting anyone?
@MariaBartiromo @MorningsMaria @FoxBusiness @SundayFutures Still can't take you seriously after your schoolgirl crush interview of Dear Leader. Probably never will.  U threw away a decent reputation
@JacobAWohl @realDonaldTrump Dude, speak for yourself!  I trust him 0% !!!!!  And only like 30% of all Americans have a favorable view of him. You are Delusional
@FoxNews @JudgeJeanine How can you call yourself a judge?  You're a propaganda mouthpiece and you're ruining our country. Plus it's unbearable to watch/listen to u
@nikkihaley Please explain how "it worked" (your words) when Trump calls KJU Rocket Man. You are working for a monster and u defend him.
@agfhome Great question , followed by non-answer.
@yashar So strange. She is their advocate. Crazy world we're living in.
@DrWendyWalsh Yes in west LA.  Chandeliers still moving. Nice wake up call.
@Acosta @ElizLanders I thought the SS ran out of money. Isn't that why KAC and DJTJR no longer have SS protection?
@SethAbramson Thank you so very much. Very informative and encouraging.
@JamesPMorrison Outrageous. He was part of the machine that's lying to us and moving us toward authoritarianism. We can't applaud him and reward him.
@AJDelgado13 Don't you think @realDonaldTrump should have an awareness of who he is retweeting?  I think it is terribly careless to retweet this person
@brianklaas @Gigitrog Thank you @brianklaas for all that you do. It makes a difference. #MuellerPleaseHurry
@SarahPalinUSA Why are you so obsessed with Hillary Clinton?  You have always been part of the problem. Never a force for good.
@CassandraRules Just curious. Is it true that the hand symbol you do in many photos symbolizes white power?  Or is it something else? Tx
@marcorubio @POTUS @VP Just a bunch of photo ops.  Helping no one.
@marcorubio @POTUS @VP Marco, if you're smart you will distance yourself from trump. But no, you will kiss up to him.  Gross
@JacobAWohl @realDonaldTrump Wrong. Trump is an embarrassment on the world stage!!
@RealJamesWoods How can you people be so clueless?  All ex presidents become wealthy via book deals, speeches, consulting deals, a forming new ventures.
@Jordan_Roth @HillaryClinton She's right!
@stevenmnuchin1 Are you going to get your nasty wife on here to defend you?  That was fun.
@HillaryClinton @realDonaldTrump Love you so much HRC
@JohnCornyn This little jab is going over well. Not a single supportive comment for you. Seriously, grow up dude. You are a total embarrassment.
@ScaramucciPost @BarackObama @HillaryClinton @MichelleObama @BillClinton It scares me that you retweet Jacob Wohl a lot. I'll have to stop following you.
@warnerthuston @brianstelter If you think she's not blaming herself, you're not paying attention!
@DanRaviv @Apple Why don't you get some good Bluetooth headphones?  Love mine!  Beats are well worth the money. Last 12 hours. No wires!
@jessiechar I couldn't care less how they look. It sounds crazy but they have changed my life. Brilliant invention. So simple and they work!
@RWPUSA #Kasich2020 (and I'm rooting for this as a lifetime Democrat).
@Lin_Manuel You are such a warm and bright light in the midst of so much darkness and chaos. Love you. Just saw the LA show and loved it.
@MollyJongFast @diannekrikler @FLOTUS You mean "heals". Trump doesn't know how to spell either one.
@YesYoureRacist Just when you think they can't go lower, there's a new bottom. Every day I become more and more ashamed of being American.
@molly_knight @perlmutations And this was all so predictable.  Little Marco - history has its eyes on you!  Have some political courage next time @marcorubio
@Evan_McMullin @MattRManfredi We need an amendment to get rid of the EC!!  Asap. It's just not leading to the outcome Americans want. Twice in RECENT history!  Wake up.
@AnneFrankCenter @POTUS What's truly sick is that millions of Americans are cheering them on. I feel ashamed to be an American sometimes.
@ClaraJeffery Seriously, he is now a verb, as in:  We "Trumped" it up (when utterly and shamefully destroying something formerly good ).
@carIisIe Brilliant
@Mikel_Jollett Yes, same with coal!  It's delusional. Nursing homes in rural areas can't find staff and r turning away seniors. Due to less immigration.
@realDonaldTrump Where the hell is the EPA in Texas?  If government can't protect citizens from the toxins being released onto victims, then u r worthless.
@BeschlossDC Madison, Washington, Burr, Franklin  and ??  (Jefferson or Hamilton?)
@JacobAWohl @SebGorka Grow up. What is wrong with you people?  We know he won.
@Jordan_Roth @DianaRoss @DavidZaslav @katiecouric @Richie_Jackson Awesome!!!
@ArunChaud Yet @realDonaldTrump and his yes-men are doing photo ops  and back-slapping, saying what a great job they are all doing. Sick
@davidaxelrod @CheriJacobus @POTUS All that deregulation doesn't feel so wonderful now. And cutting payroll LOL. This won't end well. The backlash = worse than Katrina.
@amandacarpenter Seriously @amandacarpenter , you don't mean that, right?
@amandacarpenter It's just a photo op. He's 100% horrible. NEVER Trump.
@ComfortablySmug I'm a Democrat and I regularly watch Hannity, read WSJ and follow many R's.  You need to study both sides of any issue +keep tabs on others
@Maya1277Aga @tonyposnanski Meanwhile all the trump ladies wear tight sleeveless dresses and open-toe shoes. No one even mentions it!  Total hypocrisy, just maddening.
@JamesPMorrison One of these days she will have a major embarrassing wipe out and a broken ankle. She's tall, would look great in flats!
@SethAbramovitch It's a photo op, nothing more. Every time I see Melania/ivanka my feet start to hurt as I know theirs must. Stilettos dangerous, ankle break
@amandacarpenter I  love you Amanda. Keep shining a light on this rotten administration. Thank you.
@BarackObama @JoyceCarolOates We miss you terribly. I was so proud and honored to have you as our president. We are no longer a world leader. Pls play  a bigger role !
@GoodLuckGriff @CNN Could not agree more. He's disgusting and smug. Shame. I use that word a lot lately
@FEMA_Brock Stop using this event to promote trump. It's unethical and shameful. Do your job Brownie.
@FEMA_Brock Disgusting that you are using this event to make a commercial for racist trump. No ethics whatsoever. U could've just focus on FEMA response
@RepAdamSchiff @MikeLevinCA Thank you @RepAdamSchiff for all that you do. You are an American hero. We need the Trump era to end so that we can get back to sanity.
@BillKristol Thank you @BillKristol. I'm not a conservative but I greatly respect what you are doing to speak up about trump and him ruining America.
@Impeach_D_Trump @realDonaldTrump Did jendetlefsen delete her account ?  Shame. Good on her though for speaking up.
@PreetBharara Thank you @PreetBharara. You will go down in the history books as a hero during the Trump era, our historic national years of shame.
@PreetBharara @MarkSZaidEsq This is disgusting. Equally disgusting to see the people in power who aren't speaking up and pushing for a change.
@ebfavs @jonfavs @SHELuxeWed @rbuckleywedding Beautiful wedding !  Did you invite the obamas?  What was your wedding day fragrance?  Always curious. Gorgeous flowers and pics.
@PaulBegala Great job on Real Time. You are one of my heroes. Love you Paul!  Keep speaking the truth.
@RealTimers I live in LA and I'm a HUGE fan. How come the show is not available to me until Saturday? I have @HBO Now.
@BenSPLATT Good for you, using your voice and spotlight to speak the truth.  Love you.
@IvankaTrump While they are likely fake, I'd really like to know WTF anyone would conceivably thank her for? Shld be quite the opposite. Done nothing.
@jackiecarbajal What an undignified child. This is so embarrassing
@richelle_pike @saucybrahmin @TheLiberalVOR @lacakagog @MelPowell @stevenmnuchin1 That article doesn't support your assertion that DJT responsible for  strong market. Did u read it? Many experts think in a bubble anywy
@emmy_raver Hi Emmy!  You were amazing last night. I love you as Angelica. You're perfect. Saw you in NYC. Thank you for blowing us all away
@MichaelLuwoye You were amazing in last night's show. We loved it so much. Thank you for such a memorable evening. We love U and the cast!
@SoleaPfeiffer I saw the show last night and loved it so much. You have the voice of an angel. The whole cast was amazing. Ryan so cute!  Tx
@joshuahenry20 Wow!!! You just absolutely blew me away tonight. Beyond all possible hopes &amp; expectations. Genius as Burr!!  Million thanks!!
@_grammar_ @Nasty_Noah Hey @_grammar_ , do you do punctuation also?  He's got a typo on "others lives".
@danpfeiffer Also a US senator, First Lady of Arkansas, civil rights champion, founder of Clinton Foundation, improving the works for millions.
@eugenegu @hashim0307 @realDonaldTrump @BreitbartNews Don't forget #FireMrsGorka
@JordanUhl @Mike_P_Williams This made my day
@PalmerReport Like the Mooch!  How could he not learn from Anthony's experience?  The press is the real hero.
@jonfavs role *
@jonfavs Don't forget Ivanka and Sessions. Also Ross, Pruitt and some other horrible cabinet members. Hope Hicks has no business being in her roll
RT @DemWrite: Gore's done it. üëèüèΩ		RT in support of a joint call for Trump's resignation from all fmr Presidents &amp; VPs. It's time. https://t‚Ä¶
@ReignOfApril @DrJasonJohnson @JoyAnnReid Agree 1,000%. Love her so much. So many at MSNBC are my heros.
@SecElaineChao @realDonaldTrump How did it feel to hold the props at Trump's "press conference"? That's what ladies are for in his mind. I don't know how you sleep at night
@suburbandoldrum @bessbell Maybe it's because Bill Maher is connected to it. ??
@Scaramucci Anthony- you have the media spotlight for a little while. Don't squander. Tell us how you truly feel. It's of paramount importance to USA.
@realDonaldTrump If you love America, you will resign very soon. You are toxic for America. #MakeAmericaSaneAgain
@bessbell What's wrong w/ VICE?  I've only watched a few..found it to be pretty good coverage of under-covered &amp; horrible situations. What's the prob?
RT @davidmaraniss: The living former presidents -  Bushes, Carter, Clinton &amp; Obama- should make a joint statement calling on the racist Tru‚Ä¶
@RepEdRoyce He's already shown us who he is. Categorical rejection at this point is just meaningless words from him.
@kayleighmcenany @realDonaldTrump Have you read Twitter today?  The GOP is turning against him very quickly. You are delusional.
@DrDavidDuke What is the Red Terror?
@SpeakerRyan Resign. You are so bad for this country. No way to redeem yourself. We're done with you.
@SenFranken @SenFranken for president, 2020.  Let's make it happen.
@GideonResnick So true. What a freaking nightmare we're living in.
@tinatbh Your sense of humor is so unique and teen-oriented. Are you really a teenager?  It's quite an escape from Trump trying to ruin our country.
@brianklaas But hey, they had a permit. That seemed important to Trump. Truly disgusting. He needs to be thrown out of office immediately.
@JamesPMorrison Why did he keep mentioning permits??  so beside the point. Wake up!  What a disgrace. I hope this is a big wake up call for the GOP.
@thehill Trump also plans to take away funds for AIDS treatment in Africa, causing 1 million more to die. He's vile.
@SymoneDSanders Love you Symone ‚ù§Ô∏è. Keep fighting and never give up. Shame on them.
@WilDonnelly @cathymcmorris Thank you @WilDonnelly for shining light on the participants. We need the GOP to speak up; this will help.
@Scaramucci U seem to love and crave the spotlight. People do seem intrigued by U and u r camera ready/entertaining. HOWEVER, get off toxic trump train.
RT @tedlieu: The bigoted policies of President Bannon are tearing our country apart. It is time to #FireBannon. https://t.co/sGFFfQwtOw
@tedlieu Frankly it's undemocratic for WH officials to block people, let alone members of Congress. Foundation of our democracy is peaceful debate.
@tonyposnanski Serious question but petty AF. Why do the women on Fox News wear prom dresses, pounds of makeup, false lashes, &amp; big hair?
@JamesPMorrison Doesn't seem to be at all concerned about people now losing their jobs due to the expulsion.  What a compassionate guy.
@BillKristol On Fox News today they mostly talked about Hilary and Benghazi. What a joke.
@AlanDersh @JackPosobiec How far you've fallen from grace. It's such a shame. I used to have the utmost  admiration and respect for you. Who is blackmailing you?
@SenRonJohnson @SquawkCNBC This man is trash. A total disgrace.
@yashar @MaxineWaters He is garbage. Deplorable in every sense of the word.
@brianklaas I'm amazed when you put 2 and 2 together for us. Thank you!  Your words articulate so well how I feel most of the time.
@DrJillStein Delete your account. What's the point?  The feedback is toxic.
@PolitiSass @puppymnkey @4everNeverTrump Awesome, thank you!
@PolitiSass @puppymnkey @4everNeverTrump Thank you. When you say "rated", does that mean there's a place to look things up?  Tx, much appreciated.
@_grammar_ @_harrysgold I wonder how @_grammar_  selects its victims ?  LOL.  Might just be random perusing of Twitter.
@4everNeverTrump Yes, what's the deal, why?  Thank you very much. Always trying to figure out reliable sources and otherwise.
@SethAMandel If they could combine porn with avocados,  all would be lost.
@brianklaas Brian , you are a patriot and an American hero every day!  Thank you for your intelligent, accurate and compelling tweets.
@SenBlumenthal If nothing else, Flynn has tax evasion on payments from Turkey. Also there clearly were related kickbacks just follow the $
@LAPDWestLA Suspicious person near Goshen and Barrington. Pls message me for info.  see link to video https://t.co/eZnTwbod52
@PrincessBravato On ABC she's bragging about stock market. Truth is "average Americans" do not benefit from a strong market. Only the rich do.
@mikememoli @liamstack @realDonaldTrump High Quality person LOL
@AdamParkhomenko @Gigitrog The thing at the very end with Omarosa was absolutely chilling. Sad, scary. Great piece. #Resist
@RandyRainbow Idea for a parody song:  "Class" from Chicago. I think it's perfect for your voice and no-class Trump. Love you!! ‚ù§Ô∏è
@TrueFactsStated @ninaandtito An example is the recent dinner trump and Mooch had with shine, hannity and Kimberly G. Why??
@tonyklinger @rodwheeler Is this even a real account belonging to the Rod Wheeler in the news? Things are not adding up.
@VRodriguezIII @Racheldoesstuff @TheFilharmonic @DearEvanHansen You have quickly become my favorite twitter performer!! Your ham4all was great too!  Love you on CXGF ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏èüòäüòÖü§ó
@CharleeBrown329 @Lin_Manuel Dang there's our next King or Queen üëë !  That was awesome!!
@Mike_P_Williams Not one of them had the decency or common sense to NOT clap!  It's sickening.
@farenthold @RepDaveBrat @CongressmanGT Don't you have anything more important to do than wishing happy birthday to everyone?  Grow up.
@meredithperry @Billbrowder Also check out Bill's interview on the Planet Money podcast "Meeting the Russians ". It's quite excellent.
@Billbrowder Agree you are a hero. Excellent source of info for me was the Planet Money podcast you did - "Meeting the Russians"
@amandacarpenter Also the story of Sessions' calls with the Russian ambassador has gotten buried. Too much news speeding by.
@goldengateblond Can't watch. Just too sad.
@realDonaldTrump @SenJohnMcCain I don't think @realDonaldTrump and @JacobAWohl understand what an MTP is. SAD!! They seem to think the healthcare debate is over.
@Brian52173 @perlmutations Loved it.  All three of you on that panel are faves.
@goldengateblond There's gotta be a reason. So truly bizarre!!  Otherwise looks like a normal woman
@Scaramucci Obviously he's speaking about Sarah. Much as I hate to say it, she DID look very nice and professional on fri. Hair/ makeup and clothes good
@tedlieu Ted-please tell us why our government made this deal?  What possible reason is there for not having him under oath ?  I find it unacceptable
@MikeLevinCA I'd like to know why Congress and/or Mueller agreed to this? I'm hopeful there was a good reason. America deserves to know the facts.
@RandyRainbow Brilliant AGAIN!  Love you so much RR. when will you get a show ?!  We need more of you ü§ó
@perlmutations Yes very entertaining and effective!
@brianstelter @KellyannePolls @ReliableSources I'm as anti-Trump as they come but I make a point of watching Fox in addition to CNN/NYT, etc. bc it's important to hear what's being said.
@brianstelter @KellyannePolls @ReliableSources I trust that Brian will ask tough questions and not allow her to pivot / deflect. I vote YES because she needs to be exposed even more.
@TheDailyEdge Don't forget, Mooch said Trump's got good karma too and he's a wonderful person. LOL all day long.
@JoyAnnReid @Exposingfrauds7 Utter nonsense. Good grief. He has no clue.
@MNSkinny @jakesilverstein That cover is absolutely brilliant
@Sisu_Eagle @arabgirlnxtdoor @LukeBarnett @jakepaul I'm not interested in Jake Paul but find it sad and surprising that the world has made him a star for doing dumb stuff. We've devolved.
@Sisu_Eagle @arabgirlnxtdoor @LukeBarnett @jakepaul When a story is trending on Twitter it's a story worth reading bc it is a reflection of something happening in the world. -1/2
@elijahdaniel @heyits_hxlly Johnny Knoxville's pranks, stunts and jokes are funnier/smarter and he's not a dumb kid.
@LukeBarnett @jakepaul Agreed. This entire thread illustrates the downfall of our society.  I've never been so glad to be in my 40's.
@Apey April- you should date Dana Gould. Listening to you on his podcast now , very entertaining . You have a lot in common!
@BettyBowers How come so many Republican women are vile - Kelly Anne ConJob, Ann Coulter and this lovely lady...?
@JacobAWohl @realDonaldTrump Please stop mentioning HRC and Obama. We know she lost. Look inward and deal with Trump's many many serious issues. Move on, don't deflect.
@BettyBowers Criticizes Obama regarding Otto in NK.  So what is Trump doing for the remaining hostages in NK?  By his logic they sb home by now.
@sarahkliff Why doesn't the media ask about this?  Politicians need to at least give us a reason. It's BS and one reason no one trusts politicians.
@MiggstaC09 @BJAofficial Bravo Bravo Miguel, this was absolutely fantastic. Thank you
@Kris_Sacrebleu I'm gagging
@RexHuppke She said we don't have collusion "yet". May have been a tell on her part.
@RobbyMook In addition, why should we believe a damn word they say about what happened at the meeting?  Ridiculous!!!
@SHSanders45 @POTUS Sarah -it is not your place to tell Americans  how often they should be praying , which is what you did today. Separation of church /state.
@edhelms @rainnwilson @Lin_Manuel @jennyslate The next king!  Let's make it happen!!!
@unfoRETTAble @HamiltonMusical @AmericaFerrera That was amazing. I can never remember the words and spitting them out so quickly is impossible. Wow!
@angelicavale @HamiltonMusical @jaimecamil @Lin_Manuel @biancamarroquin @DiegoBoneta That was magnificent ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
@IainLoveTheatre @HamiltonMusical Amazing!!!  96,000 congrats to you!!
@tedlieu Does anyone know how NYT got Jr's emails?  I thought only Jared and manafort were CC'd.
@chrislhayes @liamstack @DonaldJTrumpJr Truth is unless there are tapes, we'll never known who was there and what was discussed. They are ALL liars. Lordy I hope we have tapes!
@tinatbh And their ringtones are always lame.
@BettyBowers Best tweet of the month.
@kylegriffin1 Who is the most hated man in America - DJT JR or Martin Shkreli?
@SethAMandel April is an outstanding reporter.  We could nitpick people all day long, especially faux pas committed by the Trumps. Silly waste of time.
@jonfavs We need to twist arms (metaphorically LOL) so that some amazing folks step up and run in all the future elections. Get our blue wave going!
@jonfavs @jonfavs I know you likely won't see this. I think priorities are electoral college reform, finding GREAT D candidates &amp; voting rights. NOW!
@playbill @JLTsayswhat @DearEvanHansen @rachelbayjones So beautiful thank you üíîüòø
@AynRandPaulRyan I believe this was during the Putin mtng. Someone else should have sat in-certainly not Ivanka. This is just surreal. Where is R outrage?!!
@agog146 @JuddLegum Where are John McCain and all the other Republicans?  The silence is truly disgraceful and all will be on the wrong side of history.
@jonfavs That's depressing. My respect for Gergen just went out the window.
@GretchenCarlson Where is our savior @IvankaTrump ?  Lol just kidding
@mmyron1018 @StopTheSpeaker Ivanka wears sleeveless dresses with open-toed shoes all the time (at the White House)!! Seriously, what year is he living in?
@ananavarro @WhoseRyanStiles I couldn't love you more Ana
@michaelianblack Me too. Frightening that this guy is part of Homeland Security!!!!  #25thAmendmentNOW
@PattiSolisDoyle It's very upsetting that our tax dollars are paying @DanScavino's large salary. He is inflammatory, divisive and dangerous to the USA.
@birkirstin @peterdaou His twitter postings are nothing but nasty bullying comments. I dread reading them. Good luck Melania, on many levels.
@piersmorgan What has happened to you Piers?  I was actually a fan when you were on CNN. But you've turned out to be a nasty horrible person!  Really sad
@Impeach_D_Trump .... also miss Michelle, Jill and Bill.
@maddow @Exposingfrauds7 We're almost 12.5% done with his first term.  Clearly he is not able to run an administration effectively and needs to be replaced.
@thehill What a disgrace. He's a joke and a dangerous one. Horrible news as a result of this administration every single day. Can't end quick enough.
@RandyRainbow Brilliant. Love all of your work.  Thank you Randy!!  Can't wait to watch your career soar...
@Kris_Sacrebleu Tears. Love him. What have we become ??
@JoyAnnReid @thedailybeast Excellent piece. Thank you Joy.
@SethAbramovitch I believe it is "San Vicente Foods" now, not Bristol Farms.  Thanks for the excellent piece.
@THRMattBelloni @THR Minor detail - but it is now "San Vicente Foods", not Bristol Farms.  Excellent piece.
@jamesmiglehart lol you're so great they didn't notice. Can't wait to catch you in that role.
@DavidHMandel @decider I couldn't agree more. Love love ‚ù§Ô∏è him!  Shaking the devil's hand lol.
@kingsthings @billmaher Amen and thank you Larry.
@ThePerezHilton @realDonaldTrump Whatever happened to his claims that Obama tapped his phones?
@Khanoisseur Shocking ignorance. Also no offense to him, but he looks and sounds like he belongs in a retirement community.
@TheRickWilson Biggest shock from video - Alex Jones is 43???  I would've guessed late 50s. Being toxic, manipulative and evil ages one more quickly...
@KellyannePolls Don't you have more important things to do than spreading around your toxic energy?  Take care of your own filthy soul and work.
@CLewandowski_ There is plenty of corruption to go around. It's part of our political system on BOTH sides. If you think it is just the Dems u r naive.
@CLewandowski_ Did you tweet this because she is black?  Racist much?  You are such a positive force for unity and change. Sad.
@amandacarpenter Amanda - I applaud you and thank you. I was not a supporter during your ted C days but lately I have been singing your praises. Thank u.
@MariaBartiromo @MorningsMaria @FoxBusiness I hope you can regain your credibility after that schoolgirl crush interview you did with Trump. It was a sad day for me; lost respect 4 u.
@JeffreyToobin Love your sense of humor. Love your insights and thoughts on cnn. Keep up the excellent work.  Thanks
@_mandygonzalez @WSTNorwalk Absolutely beautiful!  Have fun you fearless girl!
@donaldwebber Is alysha playing Eliza, not Peggy? @alysha_d
@jamesmiglehart @LauraDern @HamiltonMusical One of my all-time favorite actresses with my new favorite Broadway guy!  Great pic.  Congrats on Laf/Jeff
@ThePerezHilton I have been so confused- wondering the exact same thing!  Thanks for clearing that up.
@Bakari_Sellers Nice job on Don Lemon's show.  I love your passion and you always speak the truth.
@tedlieu There are much more important things that he should be working on. Total waste of precious time. Good grief!!
@briandarcyjames @Backstage I can't wrap my head around you being in both 13 Reasons and Hamilton.  How can this be?  Tremendous in both. Congrats!  Versatility...
@ananavarro You were great on Real Time. You are one of my heroes in these trying times. Keep up the amazing work and THANK YOU!!!
@IJasonAlexander @AmericanInParis I saw it on Sunday with the Jerry alternate. It just blew me away. The whole show was spectacular, especially the dancing.
@IainLoveTheatre I love seeing posts of Iain!  What a fun life this kid has!! He's terrific on HBO!  Congrats on the Big Bang üí• spinoff
@DearEvanHansen what is the first date of the new block ?  Thank u
@WayneBrady hi Wayne. Any idea if u will be in Wednesday matinee (3/22)?  You were TREMENDOUS in January!  Killed it :)
@leslieodomjr love you !  Miss you!

@Achapphawk @Hils_Tweets @ghaney22 hi we are coming tonight and hope you are performing!!!
@Achapphawk I hope you are performing on march 8th in the evening. Can't wait!!!
@JevonMcFerrin Any idea who is performing on March 8th in the evening?  Can't wait !!!!
@MichaelLuwoye good luck , cannot wait to see you in LA!!!  You are a tremendous and unstoppable talent!!
@JevonMcFerrin @dani_marie_k @JonRua no way, Jon is back???  That's wonderful!  I loved him in the show.
@Lin_Manuel it's ok, we love you üòò
@meghamora @Lin_Manuel @HamiltonMusical Maybe it's called #AngelicaTour because it will appear in Los Angeles?  Very curious.
@Achapphawk hi, can you tell us how long your hamilton contract is?  I'll be there in March. Thanks!  Would love to see u in any roles.
@JakeTurx he didn't let you finish asking your question. He's just a bully. Thank you Jake, keep going !!
@pja477 @RandyRainbow @JewdyGold Randy - surprised Hamilton is not one of your favorite musicals!  Also I love cabaret and chicago.
@SocialPowerOne1 true. In addition, he automatically jumps to crime and inner city issues any time African Americans are mentioned.
@AliVelshi @realDonaldTrump you are supposed to be president to ALL OF US, not just your backers and supporters.  Get back to "work"
@AliVelshi @realDonaldTrump doesn't trump have more important things to do?  The election is over. We don't need to see your love fest.
@Karenolivo good grief. Sad.
@Lesdoggg I love this!!  ‚ù§Ô∏è
@IainLoveTheatre @Lin_Manuel what an adorable picture. Can't wait to watch!  Congratulations Iain!
@frootgarden I have to know - what is PSK?  Must be a fraternity. Gross.
@WayneBrady @Rmercader @HamiltonMusical @ComedyCentral Saw you on 1/25 as Burr. You were born for the role!  I'm totally blissed out, thanks
@Travon you need to see @WayneBrady in hamilton - stat. The dude is ridiculously talented and perfect for the role of Burr. Wondrous.
@WayneBrady You were a revelation at today's 730 show. You gave us a scare with that chair in Room WIH!  Love Love loved it!!
@SydneyHarcourt you are wonderful!  Such a beautiful voice. Bravo
@ananavarro @karen_amyot love you Ana. You've made the trump situation bearable. We need your voice now more than ever.
@Lin_Manuel I recorded you SNL monologue. Whenever the stress and negativity (i.e., inauguration) get to me, I watch it &amp; feel so uplifted.
@Travon hi!  Did you buy them through https://t.co/GK8Foyje0Z?  I'm having problems with that site. Thanks
@leathau "Wouldn't It Be Nice".... so totally amazing, I'm in tears. Jared is a beautiful story-teller. Thank you Lea.
@MichaelLuwoye please add your FIRST show as permanent Hamilton on tour!  Can't wait!  Have a great vacay.
@RandyRainbow This very well may be your best video!  I've watched it several times today.  You are a treasure !!
@MichaelLuwoye I saw the briefest clip of you in Hamilton - gave me chills!  The West excitedly awaits your arrival !!
@jseller to be honest it feels like a bait and switch. VERY disappointing.
@jseller it's disappointing that @joshuahenry20 is being pulled from chi production after a few months. I purchased 1/25 tix 2 see him.
@joshuahenry20 Well, that's going to disappoint LOTS of your fans.  I'll miss you by 10 days after missing Lin and Leslie in Ny.  Show biz..
@joshuahenry20 @THR @RoryOMalley @MichaelLuwoye Congrats!!  When is your last Chicago show?  Thanks
@MichaelLuwoye @HamiltonMusical @theatermania @joshuahenry20 @RoryOMalley @Lin_Manuel congratulations to all!  See you soon!
@IainLoveTheatre Hamilton and Phantom in March. And hopefully more!
@SydneyHarcourt You all looked amazing on 60 Minutes tonight. I loved seeing the original ensemble up close!  I miss you in Hamilton!
@OakSmash Hey Oak, is there footage of your final curtain call?  We would love to see it.
@OakSmash @PublicTheaterNY Congrats, love you!  I hope Katy Perry was there!  Will miss you üòò
@MarkTLive Thank you, will check it out !  Happy Holidays.
@MarkTLive Mark, what is the name of the film your guest mentioned?  Written by Love Actually guy?  Opposite of it's a wonderful life?  Tx
@Lin_Manuel @LacketyLac @jseller @hamiltonuk @HamiltonMusical I love your cabinet Lin. Well done ‚úÖ
@ananavarro @NBCNews @MSNBC ridiculous, outrageous, hilarious. I have no more words. Good grief!  Love you Ana. Thanks for speaking up.
@Lin_Manuel when I hear Burn, the voice of Amy Winehouse keeps coming to mind. üò∞ Andra Day did a phenomenal job.
@joannagoing1 @RandyRainbow actually you would be perfect as king George in Hamilton. Would love to see that!
@KneippUS please fix your website. I've spent about 45 minutes on two occasions trying to purchase. On shipping page, says "no quotes avail"
@RandyRainbow Love you and your videos!  Love Hamilton !
@IainLoveTheatre thank you for sharing. Your posts always put me in a happy mood.
@RandyRainbow @YouTube love you. You're just so clever and talented. You're gonna be HUGE as soon as everyone learns about you.
@Lin_Manuel Congrats, you were brilliant on SNL. Did you write the monologue lyrics?   Brought tears to my eyes, loved it so much.

@HamiltonMusical @joshuahenry20 LOVE!!!!  You are all soooo talented. I saw it in NYC and I'm just as excited for #HamiltonCHI
@Steph_Klem will the choreography for Chicago be different from NYC?  Can't wait to see it again. Seeing it in chi/NY/LA in 2017!
@Jordan_Roth @HillaryClinton @billclinton lucky you!  What a lovely photo.
@alliemackay aren't you sad it's the final episode ??   I want more and more of this show. Can't wait to see how it ends
@HamiltonMusical @joshuahenry20 Love you, can't wait to see you in January!
@Lesdoggg also you only have two people on the beach to cover the entire court !
@RandyHarrison01 You were incredible at the Pantages last night.  I've been singing your praises and tunes all day!  Thank u!
@reneeelisegolds @Karenolivo love you both so much!  Can't wait to see Karen in chi!  Renee was so amazing. What a wonderful role from Lin.
@RandyRainbow @Queerty this is the third video of yours I've seen, and for the third time I'm saying - YOU ARE BRILLIANT!!  Thanks 4 laughs
@Lesdoggg Love you Leslie. You are lovely and amazing.  Ignore the trolls. They are sad and lonely people just doing it for a sick thrill.
@hamiltonssquad how about you suggest to him that once a year they have a weeklong reunion and the OBC performs together all week?
@SydneyHarcourt  I love Epsom salt baths, totally rejuvenating and amazing. What does the wntrgn  rubbing alcohol do?  Feel better!
@morgankei @HamiltonMusical this is wonderful. Thanks for creating it. Will miss the folks who have moved on tremendously.
@jennylom10 these are amazing works of art. You are very talented.
@marcmaron how's he getting along with the other cats?  He looks adorable.  I have a kitty rescued from outside as well. Love her so much.
@Hamilchat what's going on?  I thought tickets were sold out.  Is this for the lottery?
@Lin_Manuel @JazzychanXD   Who will play Hamilton in Chicago and LA?   The suspense is killing me!  I saw Javi in nyc
@ConwayShow I enjoy your show but have had to turn you off several times due to pro-gun talk. Will miss you.
@Steph_Klem @JonRua please please tell me he's leaving to play A. Hamm in Chicago !!
@JMunozActor @playbill @JonRua @HamiltonMusical   I love Jon and feel very sad about this news. I was hoping he would play Ham in Chicago.
@JimNorton he's a hypocrite. He was celebrating oj's win after the verdict. At the house. If he thought oj was guilty why celebrate?
@SashaHutchings @HamiltonMusical this photo is absolutely fierce and I love it!!  Amazing AAA job by Hamilton at the Tony's. Congrats!!
@JonRua I love your voice in this and "I'm a general, wahhhhhh!"  Beautiful piece of art!  @Leo_kat08
@JMunozActor @griffinuggets i was there too. What a magical night!  Thank you !!!
@JMunozActor will you be performing June 5th at 3 pm show?  Thanks. Looking forward to it.
@mariabamfoo I binge watched your show and absolutely LOVED it!  Congratulations Maria!  I'm ready for 10 more now!
