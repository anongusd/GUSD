Great work by @FDNY helping make John's dream a reality.		Especially on #RareDiseaseDay, it's so important for us to raise awareness on this and so many other diseases that don't always make the headlines. https://t.co/UsxCOXL6Xd
So sad to hear this news. Keeping the victim's family in my thoughts and prayers and wishing all those injured a full and speedy recovery. https://t.co/s7sf7XJzth

Great meeting with representatives from @ProjHospitality yesterday. Thank you to Rev. Terry Troia, Rev. Karen Jackson, Zulma Cruz and all of your partners for stopping by, but more importantly for the incredible work you're doing for the people of Staten Island. https://t.co/YwwiRVjq26
We're finally just a stroke of a pen away from building the seawall &amp; giving Staten Island families the relief and peace of mind they deserve.		This has been an incredible team effort, and I'm proud that we're able to get this across the finish line. https://t.co/7C3KT6HWD9
Really enjoyed our conversation! Be sure to tune in this afternoon. https://t.co/zxLPHBlry1
Great meeting @madeleine this morning and discussing with her the challenges we face on the global stage. https://t.co/M5VPb4od81
But until this is fully built, our work isn’t done, and I’m going to continue to be in close contact with the Army Corps and the local community to ensure the Seawall is built properly and on time.
Coupled with last week's funding agreement, this one-two punch will allow the Seawall to finally get built, and have the long-term stability the project requires. The Army Corps has told me that they expect construction to begin early next year.
BREAKING: My East Shore Seawall legislation just passed the House, sending it to the President's desk to be signed into law. Finally, Staten Island families will get the relief and peace of mind they deserve. https://t.co/k0NhYSEXFn
I'm proud to be helping lead the bipartisan fight to fully and permanently fund the VCF, because when it comes to doing what’s right, it’s about keeping our promises, and honoring those who put their lives on the line and didn’t ask anything in return. #Renew911VCF
Now is the chance to put action behind the words #NeverForget. Because with the #VCF running out of money and cutting benefits, thousands of 9/11 heroes and their families now face being forgotten.		That’s wrong, and if we fail to make that right, shame on us. #Renew911VCF https://t.co/YW0mXxed6G
Thank you to @RepMaloney @RepPeteKing and @RepJerryNadler for your leadership. I'm honored to join them with @RepLeeZeldin to lead a bipartisan effort to build the necessary support to #Renew911VCF
"Never Forget" can't just be a slogan. It's time to actually show our 9/11 first responders and their families that we'll always have their backs.  Allowing cuts to the Victims Compensation Fund is simply not an option. #Renew911VCF https://t.co/rcwdjYWXeJ

It would be a broken promise of epic proportions if we allow the 9/11 Victims Compensation Fund to run out, to cut benefits. Proud to help lead the fight to make sure that never happens.
The first responders who ran towards danger on 9/11 are now at incredibly high risk for diseases that can take years or even decades to manifest.		They deserve the comfort of knowing that should they get sick years down the road, we'll have their backs just like they had ours. https://t.co/QUKhxXHUco

Great meeting with @sichamber this morning to talk about how we can help cut costs, improve our infrastructure, and make sure Staten Island businesses are competitive. https://t.co/MAGQi58d1D

No child should have been taught in the conditions I witnessed, and while these changes are positive, I look forward to discussing with the Department of Education potential plans for a new location for the school. https://t.co/BvLiXhzqCz
