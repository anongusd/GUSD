@JBiebighauser You originally asked what the incentive was to work under marginal tax rates. You said nothing about fairness. I'll gladly take on the fairness question but your statement about "incentive" was stupid.

@1994sucked We are in complete agreement.
@1994sucked Possible. Still an inexcusable move by the attorneys. I think Flynn's a scumbag but his attorneys should know better.
@1994sucked That's what I would do if I were General Flynn. I'd then find a defense attorney with an impeccable reputation and ask them to file a supplement to the sentencing memo with real contrition shown.
@TwerkSackMack I figured that out too. Thanks.

That's fine. The attorneys are still responsible for what they file -- even if directed by their client. Flynn's a jackass but his attorneys wrote the memo. They should be embarrassed. https://t.co/HOvKeOpmQd
I'm not letting Flynn's attorneys off the hook that easy. That filing was absolutely moronic. Any decent criminal defense attorney would have advised Flynn so and not done it. https://t.co/YbmJkNaPfR

@jaketapper General Flynn's attorneys seem to be suggesting pretty strongly that Flynn doesn't accept responsibility for his actions.
Hey @jaketapper, have any criminal defense attorneys explained to you the strategy behind what General Flynn's attorneys are doing? It doesn't make any sense given the lenient recommendations Mueller's team has put into writing already. https://t.co/gGGq2hLfti
It's very perplexing. https://t.co/nJ5A1CrPrS
@johncardillo Then Donald should have just cut the check himself. That would have been legal. And, Donald certainly knew that. Donald wanted plausible deniability. Therein lies the rub and why an illegal, non-compliant payment was made.
I find the tactics of General Flynn's attorneys to be a bit conflicting. They are asking for leniency while ridiculing the prosecutors that have appeared very willing to be lenient in their sentencing recommendations. Help me to understand, @PreetBharara.
The folks who think the FBI acted improperly are nitwits. Do they have any clue as to how law enforcement officials operate all across our country on a daily basis? The same people are likely fine with tactics used to make people falsely admit to crimes. https://t.co/Bm3wj5Czn5

Viability gives the fetus a stronger right to life.
@Happywife151 @LynneSchmidt @LeahNTorres @LaniKaiDuck @Bianca_Tempt @virginia_house @frappalatte @EricaDVM @WitchAbortion Samantha, Your legal citations are simply argument. They are not proof of the drafters' intent. The SCt disagrees with you. Roe carefully recognized that the issue presents conflicting rights. The Court set out a legal way to balance those competing rights based on viability.

It's hard to identify the dumbest playcall by Buffs tonight. I think you need a list of at least 20 that are equally stupid.

This is a pitiful effort from the Buffs coaching staff and players. Particularly on the offensive side of the ball. On all levels we look completely unprepared.

@scott_boulware He did not. He doesn't give a shit about the Constitution. And yes Obama very explicitly sought permission of Congress in a televised address to the nation.
Also worth noting chemical attacks happened within days of dickhead unilaterally announcing to the surprise of Mattis that we were pulling out of Syria. https://t.co/nfdlxPjZdx

"Target of an investigation” is also specifically defined by the DOJ. A person is a target where the prosecutor or Grand Jury has substantial evidence linking them to the commission of a crime. Designation as a target provides clear warning to a person that they may be charged.
The "subject of an investigation” has a particular meaning within DOJ. A subject is “a person whose conduct is within the scope of a Grand Jury’s investigation.” A subject has engaged in conduct that may look suspicious but the prosecutor isn’t certain that it can be proved yet.

@CJMcKinney @Dave_von_Ebers In places where the Judge determines what the sentence is at sentencing a Judge must come to a determination as to what is an appropriate sentence which requires them to take a position on the case.

True, but it's not "passed" yet. https://t.co/du4GfTeVvp
The problem we've had now for about 17 years is that the money keeps going to the wealthy who just don't spend the same proportion on products as a middle income wage earner. (13/13)
Given the soaring stock market for the last 8 years it's clear that investors already believe in the future profitability of American companies. The problem we still need to fix in this country is balance. Money just isn't flowing throughout our economy to everyone. (12/13)
Entrepreneurship does of course need to be insentivised. It may be that our corporate tax rate is too high compared to other countries but that requires an honest analysis and recognition of all the tax deductions businesses have in this country. (11/13)
This isn't an argument for communism, it's an argument for balance. Money will flow to the wealthy, to entrepreneurs through the purchase of products. The owners of the companies that make those products obviously benefit as well and they need to be able benefit. (10/13)
This is the reason trickledown economics is voodoo. The fact is some money will trickle down but a much higher percentage of wealth will be spread throughout the economy with government spending on infrastructure or tax cuts for the middle class. (9/13)
This doesn't help the multiplier effect either. Therefore, whenever there is an increased withdrawal, such as a rise in savings, import spending or taxation, there is a potential downward multiplier effect on the rest of the economy. (8/13)
The withdrawal of income from the economy (by wealthier people) will lead to a downward multiplier effect. Wealthier people are also more likely to spend their money overseas on import products. (7/13)
Government creates more money when the injection of spending results in people buying products. The reduction in interest rates or taxes helps when it's likely that additional household money is to be spent on products which  stimulates more money in the economy. (6/13)
Of the things that accomplish this are: government funding of infrastructure (creates jobs for people who spend money on products); increases in exports abroad (creates jobs for people who spend money on products); and a reduction in interest rates or taxes. (5/13)
The size of the multiplier depends upon household’s marginal decisions to spend, called the marginal propensity to consume, or to save, called the marginal propensity to save. It is important to remember that when income is spent, this spending becomes another's income (4/13)
When people buy products the income from the purchase of those products is passed on to people who then go and spend the money on products themselves. The multiplier effect refers to the increase in final income arising from any new injection of spending. (3/13)
Every time there is an injection of new demand into the economy there is likely to be a multiplier effect. This is because an injection of extra income leads to more spending, which creates more income for other people, and so on. (2/13)
Let's talk economics. This trickle down strategy that the GOP has fought for since the 80s is as George Bush once said voodoo economics. The best stimulation for the economy increases the multiplier effect the most. (1/13)
