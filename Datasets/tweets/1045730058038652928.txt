THIS IS DIGITAL AGE AND MODERN DEVELOPMENT SHOULD BE FOLLOWED.....	              OF  COURSE,THEIR POLICIES DO NOT AFFECT ME PERSONALLY.....	            I THINK I PREFER ATIKU,LET US TRY HIM AS WELL....
BEFORE GOD AND MAN,I LIKE BUHARI PERSONALITY...BUT THE MAN IS FULL OF OLD WAYS OF LIFE...HUMAN EXISTENCE SUPERCEDE DEVELOPMENT.... DEVELOPMENT IS A GRADUL PROCESS AND IT IS NEVER A DAY JOB....APC'S POLICIES ARE TOO HARSH AND BECOMING UNBEARABLE FOR MILLIONS OF NIGERIANS...
