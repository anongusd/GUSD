my whole way of life
changed my whole perspective on what is real what is illusion
i know one thing though meeting the galactic federation
lion my teeth off maybe
so maybe i know more than the average bear maybe
i know the khazars dont have any control over that
is that galactic federation has been using ray beams above our earth to stabilize our magnetic poles from destabilizing our magnetic poles and from cracking the earths crust like an egg
but what i do see
i dont
how do i know the khazarian mafia dont control the world
a twitter page
a domain
a construct
thats kind of funny since you are in a matrix
and enjoy life without machines telling you what to do
https://t.co/m5wuoM3M2u
and work at it till the majority wins
something everyone agrees on
so what you have to do is find a common ground
of a age
you are obsolete a relic
as they would put it
too soft
machines dont like humans
still going to have to fight against the machines
then you can be free
see it for what it really is
bullshit makes the flowers grow and thats beautiful
1 2 3 4 5 t r u t h
you still have to see the truth for what it is the truth
although some of it maybe true maybe all of it
dont give up what you were taught to believe
only the rich ones who own the world or think they have control over the whole world do
oh yeah not all of those turkish people believe they came from israel
where were we ?
nobody would suspect they came from turkey
so give them some credit they got away with it so far
since the khazars once ruled the world
trying to take it over as theyre own
because they had been exhiled from every single other country
they are just pretending to be palestine
or where they are originally from
remember why a jewish person a judiaisic people cant even recall thier home land
remember how israel was created
they are poor israelies too
some actually believe they are exploiting palestine s resources for thier own greed
dont get your shit twisted homie not every israelie agrees they are in israel
some compare to how many rich people to how many poor people you will have your answer
now tell me the truth have all those people israelies znd palestinians richer than everyone else living there ?
are using it as an excuse to exploit palestines resources
the people who claim israel was first before palestine was created
i think your missing the point here
RT @ISRAEL_PREDATOR: #Schindler's List is a work of fiction. https://t.co/i25Q5pyWPZ  #holocaust #zundel
work for money or work for free
and i guess you all have that choice follow the banks or dont follow the banks
not before it is assemvled that doesnt even make any sense
but i mean carry the plan out when the plan has actually been assembled
and never back down from your own beliefs
if the world goes imperial always have a backup plan

it wont be so bad you will intergrated into a machine
short of knocking all electricity out and starting way back to time of the stone age
and thier is nothing you can do to stop the evolution of technology
the force will always be with you
https://t.co/vkQ5L5TvvS
remember your focus determines your reality
the machines can do alot better job
this you cant trust because a man made it
https://t.co/D37GTWKNOK
you will serve the machine with complete obedience
and wont be human anymore
the machines will have control over your life
and everything is peachy keen cause you can do what most interests you
be lazy care only for yourself
you dont have to do anything but relax
and although its the perfect life for you
and everything will be controlled by the internet
all technology will be intergrated in the future and automation will be your new God
all because you wanted to not work and party all day
your arts your skills your trades even your own instincts
and forget your humanity your creativness your imagination your ability to think by your self
and you will essentially become the machine
thier will be no more work anymore because the machine will do it for you
reprint with the materials you had and pop the computer upgrades the recycled materials to your brand new upgraded car
you wanted a better car for example
living in the perfect egalitarian state of utopia that you created through the help of your computer
making you more machine than human
because the machines could do it better and you wanted to relax
your skills are not remembered your trades not needed and art form is lost because you all gave it up
or you can have a hand made sword that is beautiful to look at but always with flaws
yet through automation you can have perfectly made sword completely flawless
they have practiced that art for centuries
take your swords smiths for example
and humanity will have a good life because everything is done for them by the machines
thier will come a time when automation overrides humanity
they can shuffle around the poles immediately

but it never has to be that way
history is doomed to repeat itself

like i said let Turkey deal with israel
thats not important
lets not pay attention to that
40 million by the khazars
https://t.co/0bIg59HFlN
do your own research for once stead of me telling you
is how these cruel inhumane genocidal maniacs treated human beings without the media covering it
what you dont see in the media
cause they deserved it
and dont forget why other people get thier come upins in the End
look up All the people
https://t.co/OjaEdbjbTC
here ill help you
look up All the holcausts in the world
you reep what you sow
and still are committing genocide right now this very moment
but yeah lets feel sorry for them for us committing genocide on them when in truth they started committing genocide first a long time ago
while going behind all our backs they are secretly commiting genocide right now
were supposed to feel sorry for israel for getting what was comming to them
its kind of ironic more like moronic though isnt it while everyones feeling sorry for israel getting thier rightous smack down for committing genocides again and again through forbidden history
and its parked directly in Palestine territory
israel is a part of Turkey
Palestine is not israel
let the Turks deal with thier own problems
israel is fake
whats going to happen when the whole world figures it out
khazars come from Turkish decent they were Turkish nomads
and we all know the first jews were khazars
what is Turkey going to do when it finds out israel is trying to pretend to be it ?
a fake leader a fake country
so Turkey is illegally in Palestine pretending to be israel
only thier is already a Turkey and already a Turkish leader
and thier is already a country called Turkey so israel is illegally on some one elses land Palestine's land pretending to be Turkey
and that somewhere is Turkey only israel doesnt want anyone to know they are actually Turkish
like i said before jews or Judaism is a religion you have to have come from some where
israel is pretending to be someone they are not and thats Palestine
wait until Turkey figures it out
they have done alot of damage these Turkish nomads
i do not know how harsh the repercussions will be when Turkey has to deal with thier own nomads
Palestine will be Palestine again
whats going to happen when the whole world figures it out ?
and its Turkish nomads just hiding out waiting for the heat to die down
wait until everyone finds out israel aint real
thats a country you dont fuck with
are going to have face Turkey one day
telling you these Turkish nomads
remember them all
so many holocausts forgotten
or Yemens ?
how about Palestines holocaust can we remember that ?

and Turkeys paying for it
Palestine will have thier country back
so Turkey must be responsible for Israel's actions
Turkey invaded Palestine
since israel really a part of Turkey
israel will be punished for thier insolence to Turkey
and Palestine will be compensated for thier losses by Turkey
because israel is from Turkey
Since it was Turkey that invaded Palestine not israel
Turkey will handle this

this will be a toughie i know this
so how do you convince them they are in the wrong country
i dont want to have to force them out
Palestine belongs in Palestine
back to Turkey they dont belong in Palestine
send the jews back to thier home country before they were jews
the people before that were there are an entirely different people at an entirely different time
it was only real since 1948
thier should of not been any israel since israel was invented by the rothschilds to exploit Palestines resources
you rewrite the bible !
how are you going to convince israelies they are living in the wrong country ?
sleeping rays fact or fiction ?
sleeping rays come down at night and you go to sleep

jews are Turkish nomads
israel came from Turkey
and israel is not Palestine
Palestine is the true origin of Palestine
you cant buy a country your from
stop lieing about your origin your not israelites israel was only created in 1948 and bought by the rothschilds
Judaism is a religion not a place of origin
jews have to stop pretending they came from israel
Turkey heads
are from Turkey
saying they lived there even before Palestine
and israel that was trying to take over Palestine and call it israel
Palestine will remain Palestine as it always was
i dont want anymore arguements
jews are from Turkey not israel

i would never train the israelie army
and without any backup they are the most pathetic army on earth
i would never support the israelie army
they shoot innocent children for no purpose
terrorists take lives
israel is not a counter terrorist how many lives has israel saved ?
israel takes innocent live without purpose
israel is not a counter terrorist
a counter terrorist saves lives
i will not support israel as counter terrorists

thats why you never hear about the space outside the matrix
if it doesnt its deleted
you get it now how everything has to work for everything else
because a newer program gets written in to replace them
those chosen for deletion
the exhiles
aliens werwolves vampires
the other ones you hear about them all the time
they are invisible
the programs doing their job you would hardly even notice they are there
everything is governed by everything else
when you look around what do you see
the matrix is a system that system is our enemy
that has been your life so far
if you want chaos you simply dont follow the program you are setup with
and the systems would turn in on each other
the whole system would crash without using a central bank
you know what would happen ?
ok try and change the federal reserve back into the program of the silver dollar
everyone is a program in the matrix
because everyone is a part of the program
and because everyone follows the program they cant change it either because they are still in the program
of course the matrix wont let us change the program
thats why we have to revert back to silver to make the federal reserve worth meaningless nothing
thats because they own the fed the rothschilds own the federal reserve

those who did not break the rules
who should do the punishing ?
rules are rules you break a rule you get punished
you will be ready or you will not
and we will all be left scuttling to hoard our own resources in order to survive to keep alive
the banks will close one day because thier will be a blackout
you can control your emotions
your intelligent beings youll figure it out
choice is up to you love or hate physicality or spiriruality
those surviving no more clean air
again
otherwise blow yourselves up thier is no doubt your about to do it
you can take care of a planet and its inhabitants peacefully
show the prime creator those creators after
as a whole planet and its inhabitants
all fear must go in the way of love for one planet
i think you are missing the point still
one planet
not the solar system or the universe or the galaxy
and good start is the love for this planet
so let them eat your fear if you want to or you can transform fear into love
all consciousness is spiritual
and their is always that
and as david icke said all that is and all that ever will be is consciousness
spiritual spiritless
the cage emotionless perpetual fear dominance
and stuck you in a cage you cannot see
these reptiles won dominance of planet earth
your spiritual love for emotions and emotional spiritual concsiouness on another level
not fearful of the benovlent intelligence that are before you today fueling thier control with your emotions
the love that the prime creator has installed in each one of you makes you spiritual beings
that is radio station now
the knowledge of the prime creator
you will never win without the knowledge of spiritual concsiouness
open up you knowledge of your own spiritual light of consciousness within
thats entirely up to you drop the fear these putrid beings have installed upon you
and all the creators after them
and maybe one day you too may meet the prime creator
that is your job
and heal the environment so it is good again
unite this earth and all it inhabitants
you missed the point the whole time
because without it they can only exsist on one level of consciousness at a time
reptiles everywhere fear that light
the light that shines within
accept you can create a world from stupid to brilliant
embrace the prime creators love within
cause were branded stupid idiots
you notice how were not trading yet or even made official contact with the prime creator or the galactic federation
youll never left alone
embrace the technology of the prime creators love
were done fuck this up and you be left alone
you may think of this as a test of the human experiment if you are worthy or not of the prime creators love
into the prime creator
it overwhelms the senses to pure emotional waves of a spiritual upheavel of your soul
it completely fries the machine when it is pure love
love is uncontrollable
you must raise your spiritual concsiouness to pure love
you cant let these types of beings absorb your emotions anymore
if ypu see a problem you can do two things reptillisn brains say kill it annihilate it a way a machine thinks delete it a spiritual being a human being the mammal brain resolves it
that choice is up to you alone
it can be a paradise or it can be a hell
you only have one place to live
you have that ability to elevating those emotions from purely physkcal consciousness to a purely spiritual lne by pure thought alone
do not let them fool you into fueling thier emotions
they will never make it to our existence
it cannot be purely physical
where is something is purely spiritual
these beings will never be able to adapt to these plains of exsistence
since spirituality and physicality are on different planes of consciousness
so those that fear fear are not those that have the ability to love you
fear is thier favorite
these reptillian will eat any emotion you broadcast to them
using a propper channel love can annihilate hate
undeniably is love
the one emotion that these machines cannot control
for those not in love cannot be human
all over the world leaving a marker gene
thus undeniably proper coordinates love chakra can be activated
love is the law love under will
do we terminate or continue this human experiment
you saw the annunaki and the paleidians had a war over this planet
https://t.co/W72G8vaZMK
they live off your emotions
that the reality of physicality and spirituality are entirely different conciousness
they are preying prying off us emotionaly
