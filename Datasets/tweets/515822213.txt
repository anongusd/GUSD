RT @SenatorTester: ICYMI - I'm excited to be traveling across MT this week, but here's a peek at what a typical day is like fighting for MT‚Ä¶
Make no mistake. There are still politicians in Helena and Washington DC who are cutting backroom deals to rip health care away from thousands of Montanans. Learn #WhatsAtRisk if they get their way: https://t.co/POOoYE38N9 #mtpol https://t.co/U6LHGRD3fg
We need real solutions that will lower the cost of prescription drugs. That's why I've introduced multiple bills to hold pharmaceutical companies accountable, shed more transparency on pricing &amp; bring down health costs for all Montanans. #mtpol		READ MORE: https://t.co/0ldxUQzaHz https://t.co/uOnOnt0kla
Montanans are forced to pay too much for prescription drugs. It is time to shed more light on prescription drug pricing so folks don‚Äôt have to choose between putting food on the table and buying the prescriptions they need to stay healthy. #mtpol	https://t.co/p7fhmaNGnf
Montanans are forced to pay too much for prescription drugs. It is time to shed more light on prescription drug pricing so folks don‚Äôt have to choose between putting food on the table and buying the prescriptions they need to stay healthy. #mtpol
When funding for our CHCs lapsed for over 130 days, I stepped forward with a bipartisan solution to secure the funding they needed to keep the doors open. #mtpol READ MORE: https://t.co/hU0GhqmuPv https://t.co/yFkbXStMwX
MT‚Äôs CHCs provide quality, affordable care to thousands of Montanans. That is why I brought both parties together to secure long-term funding for these critical institutions. #mtpol https://t.co/63RFQZBl0n

Before our bipartisan Veterans Appeals Improvement and Modernization Act was signed into law last summer, the disability appeals process hadn‚Äôt been reformed since 1933. This new system will make sure #veterans can choose an appeals path that works for them. #mtpol https://t.co/p7eP32ZZJR
If you go fight for us, we‚Äôre going to take care of your health care when you get home. That‚Äôs why I worked to reform the disability appeals process and why I won‚Äôt stop pushing until @DeptVetAffairs has the resources to care for #veterans. #mtpol	https://t.co/BXVoHVY0s1
Today's #FlattopFriday goes out to @SenatorIsakson (R-GA). As Ranking Member of the VA Committee, I couldn't ask for a better @VAChair. With help from both sides of the aisle, we're making sure our veterans get the care &amp; benefits they've earned. #mtpol https://t.co/oaAn2na5Fr https://t.co/ZihSb4qGZd
After almost 2 years of working hand-in-hand with @VAChair Johnny Isakson (R-GA) I know that bipartisanship is not just possible, but productive. By working together &amp; finding common ground we've managed to get big things done for our veterans. #mtpol 	https://t.co/28k31JfV4h
Those are just 2 of my 11 bipartisan veterans bills that have been signed into law this Congress.  I will never stop fighting for our veterans. #mtpol https://t.co/5uKlYwv2BB
The #VAMISSIONAct will make it easier for veterans to get the care they've earned. This is a bill I was proud to champion and usher to @POTUS' desk. #mtpol
My VA Accountability bill is holding the @DeptVetAffairs accountable to Montana veterans. I was proud to work with @VAChair Johnny Isakson to pass this legislation. #mtpol
I‚Äôve been working across the aisle to pass several major VA reform bills because our veterans have earned the very best. #mtpol
#TBT https://t.co/mt3SHrnc3k
In December, @POTUS signed my bill to declassify the records of Billings veteran John Olsen who was unknowingly exposed to chemical agents as part of Project SHAD. Now, John can use these records to apply for @DeptVetAffairs disability benefits. #mtpol	https://t.co/jz2Dv3Qrzs https://t.co/wyPPcbP0eW
It's been 950+ days since the @DeptVetAffairs received scientific evidence that veterans exposed to Agent Orange are at a higher risk for bladder cancer, hyperthyroidism &amp; other conditions‚Äîbut they still haven't responded. The VA must act NOW. #mtpol	https://t.co/FrYG8wBenq
On June 6, @POTUS signed our #VAMISSIONAct into law, calling it a ‚Äúhistoric moment.‚Äù The @DeptVetAffairs now has one year to implement it &amp; I‚Äôll be holding them accountable to ensure they use the tools we‚Äôve given them to get the job done right. #CompletetheMISSION #mtpol https://t.co/R56T4yTWcF

This week I took to the @SenateFloor to stop the expansion of junk health insurance plans that don‚Äôt even cover the basics. Unfortunately, we fell one vote short. But I won‚Äôt stop fighting until every Montanan can see a doctor w/o breaking the bank. #mtpol	https://t.co/2DtnKk2rJS

Starting last week, health insurance companies now have permission to sell long-term junk plans to Montana families. That‚Äôs why I‚Äôm sponsoring legislation to stop corporations from shilling shoddy plans that don‚Äôt cover Montanans‚Äô basic health care needs. #mtpol #WhatsAtRisk https://t.co/qdNMxi2k0l
A few years ago, Kalispell community and business leaders approached me with a plan &amp; we were able to secure a $10 million grant to build the Glacier Rail Park. Today we celebrated the grand opening of this new rail park! #mtpol https://t.co/91JtJLOj84
Today's news is a positive step forward, but it‚Äôs only a temporary solution. I will continue fighting to pass my bill that permanently bans mining on the doorstep of @YellowstoneNPS to protect it for generations to come. #mtpol #DontMineYellowstone https://t.co/2NEIM3CfVe
2 yrs ago we secured a temporary mining ban on the doorstep of @YellowstoneNPS‚Äîwhich expires at the end of the month. So I‚Äôm calling on @SecretaryZinke to extend this ban until we can pass my Yellowstone Gateway Protection Act. #mtpol #DontMineYellowstone	https://t.co/X2p7lMJNKa
As someone who still lives in the tiny town I grew up in, I firmly believe that there is no better place to live, work &amp; raise a family than rural America.

#FlattopFriday https://t.co/Sp1mop5Q3f
When corporations sell their workers down the river, they shouldn't be able to cash in on the backs of taxpayers.

‚ö°Ô∏è ‚ÄúA Year in Review‚Äù	https://t.co/E1APaLyhIC
#1 - This year Washington politicians passed a hastily-written tax bill that saddles our kids and grandkids with an additional $1.5 trillion in debt. Montana &amp; America deserve better. I promise to keep fighting to provide a better future for the next generation of Montanans. https://t.co/Fq5Pzoeh3v
#2 - When @POTUS first got elected I committed to work w/ him to ‚Äúdrain the swamp.‚Äù Well, here we are almost a year later &amp; we‚Äôve still got bureaucrats who won‚Äôt give a straight answer. Regardlless, I‚Äôll keep working to hold our government accountable &amp; I hope more folks join me. https://t.co/tZGZMhgRfl
#3 - One of the most irresponsible decisions this year was when @usedgov refused to fund @umontana's TRIO-Upward Bound program because 1 page of its grant app wasn‚Äôt double spaced. Thankfully, we got @BetsyDeVosED  to reverse this decision &amp; fund the program for the next 5 years. https://t.co/CPe3AyPjKL

I was proud to fight for @umontana's TRIO/Upward Bound program in 2017 and look forward to seeing all the great things the alumni will accomplish in the New Year! https://t.co/VF6FnR31g2

So I spent this year making sure our public schools had every opportunity to succeed. https://t.co/tMfP1swCfD
#5 - Even in the most polarized political climates, I can tell you that bipartisanship is not just possible, but productive. And this year we proved it by sending 11 bipartisan bills to @POTUS' desk. Yes, legislating is hard these days but together we delivered for MT. #mtpol https://t.co/uzxDAk8kDl

#9 - Health care was a defining issue of 2017 &amp; I was proud to help defeat a lot of bad bills written behind closed doors, without public debate, and along strict party lines.
