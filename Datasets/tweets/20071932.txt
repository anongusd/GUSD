David Vela ends the conversation with a note of optimism. When he sees #LatinxLeaders that care about the Environment, like those present today, he believes that we are well on our way to having the necessary conversations to finding real solutions.
David Vela agrees, "Yes!" It is our job as community members/partners to engage with NGOs, policymakers, and our communities to encourage ways we can own and address the direct impacts we have to the environment.
@travelmatters expresses that there is a lot of consensus, bipartisanship, and unity behind funding and creating conservation parks. She asks: is there a way for us to work around climate policy through our love of the environment?
David Vela says, "there are so many opportunities in the outdoor industry." From session managment, trips in the back country, horse tours--these are industries and opportunities that our community can access.
David Vela: "We have to make ourselves relevant to our community," especially in terms of empoloyment and community through education advocacy/work.

Caroline Crozier ended the panel by encouraging everyone to be the change that we want to see and to highlight the importance of education in framing the future of our nation/communities.
Caroline Crozier: funding education should be a greater concern than funding a wall.
@tlharnisch addressed the need to frame policy discussions about education through fully supporting and funding education services and institutions.
@LundyPonce stated that it is our job as a community to encourage young passionate leaders to become future educators and nurture the growth of our communities through education.
An audience member mentioned the significance of ensuring educators are being supported, especially financially, and that students are really being taught effectively.
@tlharnisch expands that this need applies to higher education especially. Universities and colleges should be ensuring that faculty are aware and directly represent the student experiences.
@SusieSDC explains that it is very important to create culturally competent resoures that support students with diverse experiences.
Caroline Crozier mentions the struggles of keeping students in school, especially higher education.
@tlharnisch spoke towards encouraging college and universities to be included in this process as well and create programs that ensure students are supported, i.e. bridge programs that help prepare for college.
@Lily_NEA responded that there is a need for more or better-informed counselors to support first-generation students, especially, through the daunting process.

We'd like to thank @everythingloria @JustinaMachado @Isabella_Gomez for an amazing panel and for speaking to the importance of intersectional representation for our communities and their experiences.
@everythingloria Just keep being proud. It is our wish to continue to see rooms be filled by passionate Latinxs like those here.
@Isabella_Gomez We are so inspired by you all! You already are doing so much to stand up for our communities. Just keep going.
@SindyBenavides asked: any parting words of wisdom?
@Isabella_Gomez For a question of acting, it will take a lot to keep going and it is always a process of training for the job.
@Isabella_Gomez The show genuinely aims to be a model for how families can have difficult conversations.
@JustinaMachado We all put aspects of our own latinidad to our characters and thinking about how they would genuinely react.
@everythingloria The honest conversations and organic reactions is most important with the show.
@everythingloria writing the show became an aspect of balancing information and how actual personal conversations are had.
@Isabella_Gomez Elena's coming out story was well recieved especially since it wasn't simplified into one episode but rather was addressed throughout the show over time. Just like real life.
The quincenera episode really spoke to the nuances of Latinx experience: what was the feedback received from that?
@JustinaMachado reploed finding your community is imporant. @Isabella_Gomez added that supporting each other empowers everyone to grow.
@everythingloria You have to believe in yourself. Be proud of who you are and make yourself heard.
A question has been asked: What were the things that really empowered you as Latina women?
We are not opening up questions from the audience. Send us any questions you may have!
@SindyBenavides asked why is it important to have a show tackle "controversial" issues such as sexism, homophobia, immigration, mental health, and more.

@AlexNowrasteh explained the need to support immigrants through concrete policies that uplift our communities.
@GabyPacheco1 encouraged all attending to be open to other opinons and work together to find solutions for our communities.
@AlexNowrasteh replied that compromise is hard but necessary. It is better to compromise and move forward with solutions for our communities than coming out with nothing. In any case, advocate for what you believe.
@GabyPacheco1 replied that it is important to know different perspectives and get information from different sources to understand points of compromise and agreement that both sides can work on.
@Domingotexas replied that it is important to run for elected office and encourage representation of our communities.
There was a question on keeping elected officials accountable when compromise seems to force communities to give up essential principles.
Our first panel, "Town Hall: A Bipartisan Meeting on Immigration," is about to end.

A10. Creating awareness of HIV can be as simple as starting a conversation about safe sex and HIV testing among your family and friends. The more we talk about HIV, the more comfortable we become to start conversations and reduce stigma. https://t.co/wzc0tgjbSo #StartTalkingHIV
RT @NHMAmd: Q10. How can someone spread awareness about HIV among their community? #NHMAHIV #DoingItMyWay #HaciendoloAMiManera
A9. There are ways you can prevent sexual transmission of HIV! You can take medications such as pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) to reduce your risk of HIV. Talk to your partner about your status and make sure you are both being safe. #NHMAHIV
RT @NHMAmd: Q9. If someone is HIV+ and practices safe sex, what advice would you give their partner? #NHMAHIV #DoingItMyWay #HaciendoloAMiM…
A8. Yes. Mother-to-child transmission of HIV can happen during pregnancy, childbirth, or breastfeeding. Seeking antiretroviral therapy (ART) as soon as possible can help suppress HIV and keep the mother and baby healthy. #NHMAHIV
RT @NHMAmd: Q8. If someone who is HIV+ becomes pregnant will their baby be at risk? If so, what should be done? #NHMAHIV #DoingItMyWay #Hac…
A7. Early detection of HIV is important! If you have HIV, antiretroviral therapy (ART) uses a combination of medicines to suppress the virus in your body. Not only does this keep you healthy and your immune system working, but also prevents AIDS – the last stage of HIV. #NHMAHIV
RT @NHMAmd: Q7. What is the most effective way to prevent AIDS? #NHMAHIV #DoingItMyWay #HaciendoloAMiManera
A6. A follow-up test (usually lab-based) may be taken to confirm a rapid test positive result. If you have HIV, your health care provider can help discuss your next steps for treatment. #NHMAHIV #DoingItMyWay (2/2)
A6. At-home tests can take 20-40 minutes. Rapid testing at a health center can take anywhere from 2-30 minutes. Laboratory-based tests use a longer process (30 minutes) that is more accurate, but require several days to arrive at testing labs. #NHMAHIV #DoingItMyWay (1/2)
RT @NHMAmd: Q6. What should someone expect an HIV test to go and how soon will the receive results? #NHMAHIV #DoingItMyWay #HaciendoloAMiMa…
A5. Generally, it can take 2 to 6 weeks to detect HIV. No test can detect HIV immediately! If you think you’ve been exposed to HIV in the last 72 hours, ask your health care provider about post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) right away. #NHMAHIV
RT @NHMAmd: Q5. How soon after HIV exposure can a test detect HIV? #NHMAHIV #DoingItMyWay #HaciendoloAMiManera https://t.co/VIQGRhMjvE
A4. The CDC recommends you should get tested at least once as part of your regular health care routine. If you are at higher risk, then it is best to test every 3 to 6 months. Visit https://t.co/75W92qM3Iv to determine if you should be testing regularly. #NHMAHIV #DoingItMyWay
RT @NHMAmd: Q4. How often should someone get tested? #NHMAHIV #DoingItMyWay #HaciendoloAMiManera
A3. Testing sites can be found through the #ActAgainstAIDS widget at https://t.co/0skr5oj09u, many of which provide free testing. There are many options to get tested, even from home! You can find more on home tests by visiting https://t.co/KptVrhskHx #NHMAHIV #DoingItMyWay
RT @NHMAmd: Q3. How can someone find a local HIV testing site and where can individuals without insurance get tested? #NHMAHIV https://t.co…
A2. Gay, bisexual, or men who have sex with men are most at risk for HIV. Black and Latino populations are disproportionately affected by HIV. In 2015, Latinos accounted for 21% of individuals living with HIV in the US despite only representing 17% of the US population. #NHMAHIV
RT @NHMAmd: Q2. Which groups of people in the U.S. are most affected by HIV? #NHMAHIV #DoingItMyWay
A1. Most commonly, HIV spreads through sexual behaviors and using contaminated needles or syringes. Less commonly, from mother to child during pregnancy, birth, or breastfeeding or being struck by a contaminated needle or sharp object. More at https://t.co/EOodh5kn9R #NHMAHIV
RT @NHMAmd: Q1. What are the many ways HIV can be transmitted? #NHMAHIV #DoingItMyWay
