@MamaStaceC Seems like the federal income tax system was clearly initiated for wars...
@MamaStaceC Following the end of the Civil War, those taxes were rolled back but the War Revenue Act of 1898 created another death tax to raise revenue for the Spanish-American War.
@MamaStaceC The Bureau of Internal Revenue placed excise taxes on everything from tobacco to jewelry. However, the income tax did not last and was not renewed in 1872. In addition, the Revenue Act of 1862 created a federal estate and gift tax system.
@MamaStaceC Income Taxes in America	The first income tax was created in 1861 during the Civil War as a mechanism to finance the war effort. In addition, Congress passed the Internal Revenue Act in 1862 which created the Bureau of Internal Revenue, an eventual predecessor to the IRS.
@MamaStaceC From your own source: The history of income taxation in the United States began in the 19th century with the imposition of income taxes to fund war efforts. However, the constitutionality of income taxation was widely held in doubt...
@MamaStaceC Other then those who have failed you mean?
@MamaStaceC Revenue comes from 3 major sources:Income taxes paid by individuals: $1.48 trillion, or 47% of all tax revenues.Payroll taxes paid jointly by workers &amp; employers: $1.07 trillion, 34% of all tax revenues.	Corporate income taxes paid by businesses: $341.7 billion, or 11%.
@MamaStaceC It  clearly indicates that those earning $250K and above,who are only 4.5% of income taxes filed, paid almost 49%  of federal taxes.
@MamaStaceC I thought you were saying the rich weren’t paying their fair share, now it corporations? Apples and oranges so to speak.
@MamaStaceC Actually, they were created to fund wars, not to fulfill “promises” in our constitution. Read the legislation.
@MamaStaceC It also shows that those making $250K and above are only 4.5% of all taxpayers. So 4.5% of taxpayers are paying almost 49% of the federal taxes. Isn’t that fair enough? BTW I’ve never made 6 digit income nor even high 5 digit income throughout my lifetime.
@MamaStaceC It does show folks making over $250K pay almost 49% percent of the federal taxes.
@MamaStaceC It does shows the % of taxes paid compared to their earnings.
@MamaStaceC You do know there was no federal income taxes then? The federal income tax as it exists today dates to 1913, when a constitutional amendment made it possible for the federal government to impose taxes directly on individuals incomes.
@MamaStaceC So, then you do agree they are already paying their fair share? https://t.co/vJvW2gK6eu

@MamaStaceC @rock_chartrand By contrast, taxpayers with incomes below $30,000 filed nearly 44% of all returns but paid just 1.4% of all federal income tax – in fact, two-thirds of the nearly 66 million returns filed by people in that lowest income tier owed no tax at all.
@MamaStaceC @rock_chartrand The individual income tax is designed to be progressive.A Pew Research analysis of IRS data from 2015,the most recent available, shows that taxpayers with incomes of $200,000 or more paid well over half (58.8%) of federal income taxes, though they accounted for only 4.5% returns.
@MamaStaceC @rock_chartrand Sorry but what is a fair share? You do know that almost half the population don’t pay any federal income taxes at all. Most federal taxes are paid by a small number of tax payers.
