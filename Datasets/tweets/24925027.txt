@Calripkin True. I would prob feel the same way if I was back. Grass is always greener. lol
@Calripkin haha Yeah, no complaints! Life is good! (Although, it's been almost 4mo since I visited home so I miss it like crazy)
Just saw, nearly a week later, that there was a small but serious typo in something that I was involved in (but didn’t write) and now I can’t go back to sleep. Typos are up there with clowns and fear of failure as my greatest tormentors.
@Calripkin Twitter only ever shows me the most random, single tweets from you, w no context, like once or twice a week. This one, to “I got punched in the face a lot”, etc. It’s pretty hilarious.
@KimberlyNFoster Same. Not only am I smack in the demo (I love the book), my mother shares my acct &amp; refuses to get her own profile. She watches every. black. movie. ever. made. under my name. So I get regular promo for Chris Stokes &amp; Marques Houston films but not this?
I hope y'all know how lucky we are to be living at the same time as @imaniperry. People use the term brilliant so loosely, but it really truly applies here. I've been waiting all week to sit down this weekend and read this book! https://t.co/LN4Cn8acPf

@imsojayded Sure! Here's what I did: Stressed about it, ate nuggets all month long, went to a few Soul Cycle classes, gained 8 more lbs and canceled the shoot. That is what happens when you actually have a life and try to lose that much weight in 3 weeks. It all works out.

Best career advice that I can give: Don't ever attach yourself to a person, a place, a company, an organization or a project. Attach yourself to a mission, a calling, a purpose ONLY. That's how you keep your power &amp; your peace. It's worked pretty well for me thus far.

And that's why representation &amp; diversity are important. It's not about quotas or checking boxes. It's about making sure that as many voices as possible are given the space to tell the stories that remind someone else that they are not alone. Who wouldn't want that? #ThisIsUs
And while watching it made me unbelievably sad, it was also so cathartic. That is what good storytelling does. It validates your lived experience, especially when those experiences are difficult to talk about in public. #ThisIsUs
Every detail - The sharp pain, the needing and wanting to "wallow" in it every so often, the desperate attachment to the physical memories, the guilt, the partner wanting so badly to protect you from it...like ALL of it was so, so accurate. #ThisIsUs
I've never seen that experience captured so accurately. The aftermath. And I don't just mean the immediate aftermath. I mean the 15 years later aftermath. #ThisIsUs
Just explained to someone why #ThisIsUs is soooo good. I, a tried and true Daddy's girl, lost him suddenly from a heart attack when I was 16 yrs old.

*peeks at mentions and timeline* Why are y'all so worked up over this #Oprah thing? People are really out here FIGHTING and revoking liberal/black/feminist cards. Smh The internet takes all the fun out of having an opinion, no matter what it is.
@sallykohn I would prefer a hard nosed politician with Oprah-like qualities. My goal is to win &amp; return the office to what is should be, not just beat 45's celebrity with our own.
@sallykohn ...Oprah's brand for 30 years has been decidedly apolitical. We assume her beliefs simply because she is a compassionate, brilliant, mature black woman. And while I think she is a capable LEADER (and my favorite auntie-in-my-head) I don't assume that we share the same politics.
@sallykohn Said it in the following tweets. 1. Same reason I don't want Michelle to run. The office taints and corrupts. I don't want to protest Oprah. but also...
@akamami @wellreadblkgirl Ugggh....Please make more of this one!!! One of my faves.
@guidetoglo Thinking about you this a.m., sis. No real reason. Just sending goodness &amp; love your way. Hope your 2018 is off to a great start!!
Please let her and Queen Michelle Obama be exactly what they are: way too good and pure for that evil office.
Who wants to protest Oprah? Are we going to love her when she's ordering drone strikes? Or doing any of the things that are necessary to represent &amp; run The Empire? Nope, nope, nope.
Um....Mama #Oprah running for President is a bad, bad idea. And I don't know how anyone who loves her thinks otherwise.
Now THAT is how you give a speech. Mama O strikes again. https://t.co/bCBtVRYCvR

@GeeDee215 Sometimes I feel like I sit at the cool black kids table &amp; then get pissed when a kid comes up and says "I know y'all think I'm not cool..."
@GeeDee215 I cringe when someone presents themselves as an outlier but also turn right around and play the "you know you black when" games.
@GeeDee215 Many of us who push back on that narrative, are the same ones who take (rightful) joy in playing with those stereotypes &amp; hyperboles online.
@GeeDee215 I wonder how #blacktwitter influencers &amp; the rise of listicle culture &amp; VSB style writing has contributed to the "ALL BLACKS DO X" story.

A6 I learned to give what you have. Don't wait until you think it's enough or that you're enough. Share all along the way #CreativeSmartGirl
A6: I learned the value of transparency &amp; authenticity. There's no shame in struggle. Don't hide it. Get free. #CreativeSmartGirl
A6: I also learned that when you prioritize purpose over position, you end up exactly where you're supposed to be. #CreativeSmartGirl
A6: That's what I learned. That whatever I thought I was, I am smarter, braver, stronger than that. #CreativeSmartGirl
A6: "Always remember you are braver than you believe, stronger than you seem, and smarter than you think" - A.A. Milne #creativesmartgirl
Hmm....Gotta think about this for a sec. https://t.co/WOm6zciVVY
@LTintheCity Me too. Once someone tells you about yourself you're like "ohhhhh!! Yep. That explains it."
A5: Just stream of consciousness writing every day. It's less intimidating for me than "journaling". lol #CreativeSmartGirl
A5: Here's a good explanation of morning pages: https://t.co/WNQnpdAlwn #CreativeSmartGirl
A5: Also, practically speaking, for me it's prayer + a practice called morning pages. #CreativeSmartGirl
@ABeckCreative Hahaha Good point. Maybe a blog post? An article? Anything that you have to write. lol
A5: That is what it takes to hear your own voice. Shutting everything off, closing all the books, and just being. #CreativeSmartGirl
A5: But ultimately, you have to pull out the blank page &amp; write what is in your head/heart. No one else can do it for you #CreativeSmartGirl
A5: During the research phase, it's okay to listen to many voices. Books, friends, mentors, peers. #CreativeSmartGirl
A5: I treat my life like a research paper. There's a time to do the researching &amp; a time to do the writing. #creativesmartgirl https://t.co/jBqqYjIxok
I love the idea of something being "better than perfection". #CreativeSmartGirl https://t.co/ZqNdrGYGHt
@CCrossJohnson Hahaha I'm a PK. So NO THANK YOU.
A4: Now this doesn't mean you can't appreciate &amp; strive for excellence. Just know that even excellence comes with flaws. #CreativeSmartGirl
A4: Once I learned to extend grace and compassion to myself, I began to expect perfection less from others as well. #CreativeSmartGirl
A4: ...something within that they judge harshly. Perfectionists actually tend to be harder on themselves than anyone. #CreativeSmartGirl
A4: Pple who strive for perfection are often doing so because deep down they are ashamed of something within themselves. #CreativeSmartGirl
A4: She explains that perfectionism often comes from a deeper place of...get ready for this...SHAME. #creativesmartgirl
A4: As a recovering perfectionist, @BreneBrown’s work really helped me. #CreativeSmartGirl
A4: Nope! The human experience is, at its best, messy.
Ha. Ha. Ha. The question of my life. But the answer is pretty simple. lol https://t.co/zko2E3MURh

A3: I think the greatest gift of soc media can be to remind us that we are not alone. But that requires authenticity. #CreativeSmartGirl
A3 Inspiration comes from the Latin meaning "to breathe into". If it's not breathing LIFE into you, it's not inspiration. #CreativeSmartGirl
A3: We have to ask ourselves w everything we consume - How is this serving me? How does it make me feel? #CreativeSmartGirl
A3: No shade to ppl who build their business off promoting a glossy "boss" lifestyle, but that doesn’t feed my soul. #CreativeSmartGirl
A3 My rule: I don’t follow “perfect”. If you have the “perfect” brand that promotes the “perfect” life, you aren't for me #CreativeSmartGirl
Love this question. #CreativeSmartGirl https://t.co/S4mzXGDxG1
A2: Love this. Defeat as a practice. Because it happens. The more you feel it &amp; understand it, the better your next step. #CreativeSmartGirl https://t.co/CdLmSiBhKF
A2: Doesn't mean transformation isn't scary. But there's beauty and new life beyond the fear. Every. Single. Time. #creativesmartgirl
A2 I look at it like this: You can change kicking &amp; screaming, or you can change with grace &amp;swag. I'd rather the latter. #CreativeSmartGirl
A2: But no matter the change, no matter how I feel about it, I approach it looking for opportunities, looking for growth. #CreativeSmartGirl
A2: Many of us approach change like we’re watching a scary movie. Or getting a shot at the dr. Eyes closed. Bracing. #creativesmartgirl
A2: I change with my eyes open. That has been the key. Let me explain. #CreativeSmartGirl
Whew. Girl. Ok. Here we go. https://t.co/4Eok30lUWx
@IamMarkittaG Hey lady! &lt;3
A1: It's so much better to dream of things that you can do &amp; be right now! That's the joy in the journey. #CreativeSmartGirl
A1: And, to put a little church on it, worrying about a destination is small thinking! God may have something greater! #creativesmartgirl
A1: Destination-only thinking can paralyze. You spend time thinking about future outcomes that you can't predict/control. #CreativeSmartGirl
A1: Thinking about where you want to end up rather than what you want to do, experience and create NOW isn’t productive. #CreativeSmartGirl
A1: I've learned that focusing on a destination can be a huge distraction. #creativesmartgirl
I'm ok! Remembering what my lane is. Where am I, specifically, of greatest service? How will I show up in these times? #CreativeSmartGirl
@AdrienneEm I realized that all of your passions/intentions don't have to be reflected in your job title to matter. #creativesmartgirl

That's what I want people to know: No matter what you are fighting against today, even if it's your own faith community, you aren't alone.
Everytime I see followers of Christ speak truth to power &amp; take stands for what is righteous and just, I know that I am not alone.
That's a good thing. We should always reflect, grow, learn, progress. Never be afraid to challenge and even offend who/what you love.
As a thinking person w a commitment to justice and liberation who tries very hard to be like Jesus, I wrestle with my faith everyday.

I get racist, sexist trolling nearly every day. But an army of deranged people with an agenda to harass you until their leader says stop?
There is something different between ordinary trolling and a directed attack.
And while I knew that it would pass, the intensity of the attacks is overwhelming. The word abuse is not hyperbole.
I turned my phone off for a full 2 days. And every time I snuck a peak, I could barely breathe. It felt as if the entire world hated me.
I received death threats, vulgar images, attacks on my family, threats of sexual violence and all manner of racist words.
I wish ppl who don't understand would experience it for just a day to be able to empathize.
I legit cried when I heard about Leslie Jones. I remember what it was like to be targeted by he who shall not be named. It was terrifying.
It's been one of those days. And it still isn't over. I'm in desperate need of a lobster roll right now.

I should probably say that I style myself only for MY own approval. But I'd be lying. I'm not that evolved yet.
3 women complimented my hair today &amp; I am happy. That's how I know if I look good. I style myself based only on the approval of other women.

But this is why I love the people I know. Most of them are humble and don't value their access over the power of the people.
If I had the POTUS come to my house, you wouldn't be able to tell me anything ever again. lol
When your friend had the PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES chilling in his living room but still tries to act like he's a regular person. Cute.
This must be how non-racist, "normal" Republicans feel when they meet Trump supporters. It's surreal that we claim to love the same God.
Then after that caveat, they proceed to call me names, curse my unborn children and hold me responsible for the destruction of the earth.

Every NYC cab experience is like this. Some major "issue" for the driver. Using a credit card, my destination, rudeness, etc. I'm done.
The cab driver finally angrily takes off and continues to complain "Im going to be in traffic going this direction." Like, what???
He asks on my behalf "Would you want to walk 6 blocks in the rain in a dress &amp; heels? I don't care about traffic. Take her. It's the law"
After a few min of us arguing and him not pulling off, the bellboy comes over and asks if Im ok. He then starts to argue w the driver.
It is pouring rain so I have the hotel get me a cab. I get in, tell him where I'm going, he refuses to pull off because "too much traffic"
I have almost never had a good experience in a NYC cab and it makes me pretty unsympathetic to the unions vs Uber debate.

Taylor Swift: "Listen up, Kanye &amp; co." Beyonce: "Listen up, racists". I live for all of this. #GRAMMYs
Ok Bey. You better respond to the Formation hate. #GRAMMYs
Oooohhhhhhh KANYE SHADE. KANYE SHADE. KANYE SHADE. Taylor spoke that. #GRAMMYs
Huh. I've never actually seen a Scientology commercial in real time. "Teaching 22 mil Americans the truth about drugs." #sideeye
@rashadrobinson Unacceptable.
Would have taken a Natalie Cole tribute over those Lionel Richie shenanigans. #GRAMMYs
Aww, that little boy is adorable. And kudos to whoever cut his hair. That, right there, is a confident cut. #GRAMMYs
@AlabamaShakes Brittany Howard channeling singer, songwriter, pioneer Rosetta Tharpe, the godmother of rock-n-roll.  https://t.co/iH5aAdUqLN

Whew. I love this @AlabamaShakes song. And Brittany better wear that cape. Rock out y'all. #GRAMMYs
@Sonos Send me a set of wireless speakers and I absolutely will 😘
Yes, Bonnie!!!!! This woman is forever cool. #GRAMMYs
BB King always makes me think of my grandma. Saw him in a diabetes PSA as a kid &amp; said "He has what you have grandma!" She laughed. #GRAMMYs
the "sass and ache" she put into every note. I love that phrase so much. #GRAMMYs
@jalylah I would have traded the entire Lionel tribute for a better Maurice one.
@FeministaJones :( There's always the BET Awards.
@FeministaJones Wait stop. Are you serious? Don't play.
Gaga is having so much fun. I love it. #GRAMMYs
This is beautiful. Gaga knows how to put on a show. Fitting David Bowie tribute. #GRAMMYs
@PrestonMitchum  I need her to come out in a silk cap &amp; houseshoes with a bottle of Pink Lotion and an ankh.
I told y'all you need to read "Sing to Me". LA Reid is behind EVERYONE. #GRAMMYs
Y'all leave that little boy, his jacket &amp; arms alone! At least he's bringing some energy to the stage. I'm actually enjoying it! #GRAMMYs
Justin sounds really good. And I'm proud of his facial hair. It's being itself tonight, for better or for worse. #GRAMMYs
@DaHalperin I know. That was really not good. Both her vocals and the sound. What was going on?
Nooooooooooo. I'm just going to act like it's not happening. Because it isn't. Okay? #GRAMMYs Poor thing. Her voice is tired.
@KimberlyNFoster Yeah. This is one of those nights....
@Adele looks absolutely gorgeous. #GRAMMYs
@imsojayded lol Brittany Howard. She's black. And sings her butt off.
Yay! Either Alabama Shakes or Florence &amp; the Machine would have made me happy. #GRAMMYs
Awwww, Miguel with this MJ tribute. I'm too emotional for this right now. #GRAMMYs
Does Gwen Stefani age? #GRAMMYs
@dantebarry dis tew much.
@Lin_Manuel is so amazing. Yay Hamilton!!!!!! History + education + theater + hip hop. I'm just overwhelmed. #GRAMMYs

Finally. A true performance tonight. Passion. Substance. Energy. Ahhhhhhhhh!!!!!!!! Show out, Kendrick!! #GRAMMYs
King Kendrick is coming. #GRAMMYs
@imsojayded I mean, you wouldn't know would you?
@imsojayded You got my voicemail??????
I love exposing the #Grammys audience to this instead of confining it to the Tonys. Good music is good music. https://t.co/6Vz1encT57
HAMILTON. YES. YES. YES. YES. YES. #GRAMMYs
Sang, Tori. They may have paired you with Beetlejuice, but you are singing the heck out of your song. #GRAMMYs
I just don't understand why they are making these artists sing their songs as ill-conceived duets. Hollow is a beautiful song. smh #GRAMMYs
I remember when I first saw Tori Kelly on youtube yrs ago and could not stop watching her covers. So happy for her! #GRAMMYs
Huh? What did he say? What was that sound? #GRAMMYs
I really love this @sonos commercial. "Music makes mundane things better."
Love. Love. Love.  https://t.co/ti1JGEvYu8
@FeministaJones You need to log off right now.
@marksluckie "Did the cameraman know?" is the better question.
Yessssss, Stevie! Use your moment! #GRAMMYs

We all owe Lionel Richie an apology. #GRAMMYs
I legit laughed out loud.  https://t.co/HIqOFGpo1S
@birbigs @ryeisenberg LOLOLOLOL
I'm sorry. They needed to call Debra Lee for this. BET knows how to do a tribute. #GRAMMYs
I do not mean this as shade: Demi is making me miss that Victoria's Secret shimmer lotion I bought when I was 15. It's so festive. #GRAMMYs
@chescaleigh Girl. Nashville is everything.
@PaulRieckhoff Was thinking the same thing. The placement of that actually made me kind of sad.
Did he call her a "this burning house of talent"? hahaha #GRAMMYs
This is a very, very odd pairing. Andra is a powerful belter. Ellie is very light head singer. #GRAMMYs
Yesssss @AndraDayMusic! Heard her live and she's amazing. I hope this is good.... #GRAMMYs
I'm sorry. His pitch is ALWAYS off. I don't understand. #GRAMMYs
Well, this is awkward, Ariana. #GRAMMYs
@ryeisenberg Whew. Awaiting your "hey, you know we're all here together livetweeting right?" message, to which I say "I can't handle it."
@ryeisenberg What is happening? Are you here or not? It feels very strange to livetweet an award show now without you. haha
I've always really liked Carrie Underwood. Not sure about this spoken-word-98degrees-throwback fella though. #GRAMMYs
@imsojayded This feels like a parody. lol
@chescaleigh I was so nervous. I didn't want to have to unleash my righteous anger this early in the show.
Yesssssss. They got something right. Don Cheadle agrees. LOL #GRAMMYs

Also, after reading L.A. Reid's "Sing to Me", I'm wondering how many careers in the room have been impacted by him. #GRAMMYs
I have such a love/hate relationship with the #GRAMMYs. They usually piss me off in some way, but I can't skip them. I love music too much.
How did I not know about @GoucheTiffany before now? How, Sway, HOW? This R&amp;B, melody &amp; harmony snob is in luuuuv.

@ryeisenberg Nope. Superbowl '98.

I'm feeling responsible but sad that I chose #DemDebate over #30for30 tonight. Is it important? In theory. Have I learned ANYTHING new? No.

@atticascott oh, no, that was in response to the request for her camp to release wall street speech transcripts.
@LemontPierreC Bern &amp; Hill hitting harder at each other than ever. But Qs feel redundant. Not sure how many issues will get covered.
I'm over it re: speeches because what does it prove? If you/we don't trust her, I don't know that speeches will change that. #DemDebate
This feels a bit...tangential. Now we want transcripts of every speech she's ever given? The point has been made. #DemDebate
@ShelbyKnox tbh, I don't think it's a worthwhile issue to be debating. lol But when I've taken the time to think about it, that's where I am
@ShelbyKnox I hear you. I think the reason I would now is because of my socioeconomic status. If I was in her tax bracket? Not so sure.
I just turned to it and that lovely wordplay made my day.

This has been random Twitter PSA for softening your heart and letting people in. Back to your regularly scheduled programming.
@dariansymone Yep. Everyone always talks about the benefits but no one tells you the real: sometimes it just doesn't feel good.
Being vulnerable and open is the only way to fully be human. And man, that's all I really want to be.
As uncomfortable as it is, I know I have to do it. Because I can't really help others who are hurting if I don't ever let myself get hurt.
So I'm back at it. Gradually starting to share more, expose vulnerability, and let ppl in a big closer than before.
But the thing about life lessons is, other ppls actions don't change what it is that you need to learn.
But then someone that I let "in" hurt me pretty badly. And I closed right back up. Like a Venus Fly Trap.
I've been an unbelievably private person my entire life. But when I moved to LA I said that I was going to work on changing that a bit.
I'm learning how to open up to people more and to tell you the truth, it's incredibly uncomfortable.
And thank YOU for creating such a beautiful project! https://t.co/9ElWHryB3G
@KieseLaymon @danamo LOL Yes! That is the next step. :)
Yesssss!!! I can't wait to hear them!  https://t.co/1V1yotS76t
Then I said that I'd probably be calling them again next week because writing is hard. And they said, no prob. Thx @KieseLaymon &amp; @danamo.
They said that you don't write to be like anyone else. You write to tell stories, to say what you know. That's it. No more, no less.
I told @danamo that I don't feel as fly as she is and @KieseLaymon that I'll never be as good as he is. Then they told me to shutup.
@danamo told me to work hard, stay focused and just keep writing. @KieseLaymon told me to do me and write for the purpose of loving my ppl.
When I feel insecure about my writing, I have an imaginary convo w @danamo and @KieseLaymon. They told me some good stuff last night. ;)
I know I'm late but I finally saw @tjholmes on @GMA. So much charm! As a former #DontSleep guest, I couldn't be happier for him. Kudos!

So Rubio can just say "I don't want to address any of what you just said in your question"? He literally waved it all away. #GOPDebate
I would never want her to be my president because, you know, policy. But dangit, I like Carly's swag. #GOPDebate
I'm still trying to figure out what Carson said. I heard the words but I don't know what they mean in that order. #GOPDebate
Whew. Rubio landed that one on Bush. Lovely shot + pivot. #GOPDebate
That was such a softball question. "You're a man in a hurry. Tell us what you want to say!" #GOPDebate

@FeministaJones I told my parents and she was ultimately fired. But it stuck with me - that I was somehow threatening or scary.
@FeministaJones Teacher brought us all in, made me stand in front of the whole class &amp; asked if I had ever scared or threatened any of them.
@FeministaJones Got into a TINY verbal disagreement on the playground with one of the other girls in the 3rd grade.
@FeministaJones I had a very similar experience in elementary. Was the tall, darkskinned girl in a class full of small, white girls.
@benjancewicz It's all so disgusting. smh
There is no justification - NONE - for what we saw on that video. Anyone who says otherwise is also being violent. #springvalleyhigh

I am so unbelievably sorry that I watched that video yesterday. Felt sick ever since. Abuse isn't a strong enough word for what we saw.

@krissyyyyc Yes!! That is true. Easier said than done, but it's the ppl who push through and don't give up that change the world.
Missing the last few nights of #Belief because of scheduling but can't wait to catch the replays. For now, the livetweets will have to do.
@krissyyyyc I see and support all of the young ppl who believe and are working hard. But I also understand the disillusionment.
@krissyyyyc young ppl today are very civically engaged - but politics appears to be a broken system, better to work outside if than within.
@krissyyyyc it is an act that most undertake believing/hoping that their efforts will have impact.
@krissyyyyc I agree with you - partially :) It is a duty/responsibility. But...
Watching the #benghazihearings do you really wonder why so many young ppl want nothing to do w politics? Let alone want to run for office?
Really didn't expect a Burning Man story to be one of the most touching and raw of the series thus far. But it was. #Belief @OWNTV
Howard &amp; Shane pulled on every heartstring. "I'll never be over being sad. But it doesn't mean I can't be happy." #Belief @OWNTV
This is an entirely new look at Burning Man. Not at all how I've viewed it in the past. #Belief @OWNTV
"Please end this nightmare and come home." - Shane's letter to her mother. Gut-wrenching. #Belief @OWNTV
Howard refers himself as a "combat veteran" after his loss. Such a fitting analogy for the battle of grief. #Belief @OWNTV

Doing what works for you, regardless of whether or not it's "weird" or "corny" is a sign of maturity. Insecurity (&amp; judgment) is for kids.
I've cut back on the music &amp; started listening to preaching/inspirational podcasts/affirmations during my workouts. I've become that person.

@FeministaJones commentary, erotica, Afrofuturism....yes to all this, sis. Mind if I include it in a WhyIWrite tweet roundup for @Upworthy?
@rashi_kakkar This is absolutely beautiful! Do you mind if I include your tweet in a list of my faves for an @Upworthy article?

@Carnegro Especially because they don't know their future spouse that well. He/she is the completion of your soul...and a relative stranger.
Where does infertility come into play in the "be fruitful and multiply" mandate? Tying reproduction to faith scares me. #Belief @OWNTV
@Carnegro Right? I'm stressed just watching it.
"Marriage is something that teaches us how to love." #Belief @OWNTV
Marrying someone that you barely know is terrifying to me. But for this Hasidic couple, the fear is assuaged by trust in God. #Belief @OWNTV
But that innocence is balanced w the "love for a higher purpose" idea. Procreation, continuing tradition, etc. #Belief @OWNTV
The Hasidic idea of soulmates reminds me of the premise for our childlike fantasies about love. There's an innocence in it. #Belief @OWNTV
@AVAETC Playing on the West Coast too. They're simulasting all of the episodes.
Their story is also a beautiful look at life &amp; love with disability. He is more than his body &amp; mental faculties. #Belief @OWNTV

"The land itself is sacred text." - @Oprah #Belief
Thank God for girls like Cha Cha who share their story with their heads held high and find healing.
I know the stats. But my heart breaks open every time I hear a girl share her story of sexual assault. How can this keep happening?
Just watched Cha Cha's story a second time and couldn't hold back the tears. I hope it touched young survivors' hearts.  #OWNTV  #Belief
Can't wait to livetweet #Belief again tomorrow night! Thank you @Oprah &amp; @OWNTV for giving us this gift.
Wow. Just wow. Grandpa Terry's passing was a beautiful, powerful end note. @OWNTV #Belief

This aboriginal segment is visually stunning. @part2pictures @OWNTV #Belief

@AVAETC FYI, you may have figured this out by now but there's no west coast delay. Airing same time :)
RT @Oprah I loved the Mendel story so much because it represents right of passage. "Bye bye to childhood". #Belief
Studying Torah is so much work, "but it's like you open the window of God." Mendel re: prep for his Bar Mitzvah. @OWNTV #Belief

Welp, honestly, we all won tonight for having a debate that covered substantive issues. Kudos to the candidates &amp; @andersoncooper #DemDebate
Didn't HRC's 90 sec closer feel so much longer? That is a skilled public speaker, right there. #DemDebate
Bernie speaks off the cuff, from his heart, spit included. He won't win, but man I like that guy. #DemDebate
Who prepped Chafee? Why did they let him do this? Has he never been in front of a camera/audience before? This was irresponsible. #DemDebate
Yikes. Jim. Even with a softball question you made it painfully awkward. #DemDebate
Hillary's win that round was her support for Planned Parenthood. Hands down. #DemDebate
RT @youngsinick: Shorter Hillary: Not sure about your blunt yet. I'll ask swing voters in Colorado this time next year.
Once again, Bernie speaks like he has nothing to lose. #DemDebate
RT @lbarronlopez: Clinton out of context: "President Obama and I were literally hunting for the Chinese."
Question: "How do you compare to Hillary Clinton?" Next question: "How do you compare to Hillary Clinton?" #DemDebate

@JCann70 LOLOL No. Webb doesn't deserve a treat tonight.
@Mr_Squires hahaha
I want to take Chafee to McDonald's for a post-game ice cream cone &amp; talk to him about why he won't be playing next season. #DemDebate
"If their states agree, then we want more states to do the same." - HRC on tuition relief. So...those words don't work. #DemDebate
Jim! You get the ball and you don't know what to do with it!! Every. single. time. #DemDebate
@caribouwireless Right? Lol
Let's get the black guy to ask one question on race and the Latino guy to ask a few re: immigration. Nothing else. That's cool. #DemDebate
Let's all agree not to tweet about Chafee tonight, ok? We'll just act like he's not there. #DemDebate
Yeah. He forgot that rule.  https://t.co/BU9BeEMLhD
Jim, you're being that guy. Play well when they give you the ball and stop complaining. Nobody likes that guy. #DemDebate
I love that there is a male candidate who always sounds very angry. Takes the gendered stereotype pressure off of HRC a bit. lol #DemDebate
HRC thinks we should be impressed said that she pulled an Uncle Joey from Full House on Wall Street. How'd that work? #cutitout #DemDebate
Yep. I really, truly believe that's one of his goals.  https://t.co/YxFvRCS3FV
Jim, honey. You can stop talking now. #BlackLivesMatter #DemDebate
I think HRC is overestimating black voters' support for Obama on racial issues. #DemDebate
@danielmintz True. 100% true. I stand corrected. lol
Wait what? What? Is Don Lemon the only black journalist they know? #DemDebate
Very good moment for Bernie, standing with HRC. "Enough of the emails." #DemDebate
Hillary calling out the ridiculousness, wastefulness and the political conspiracy of the email "scandal" #DemDebate
Just watched an ad for http://t.co/E3HkTa0aKA. Heaven help us.
Can we get Uncle Joe onstage for a halftime performance now? #DemDebate
Bernie keeps saying the great, bold things that no one else will say but where he's weak (foreign policy, guns) he's really weak. #DemDebate
Is it me or is there a bizarre level of focus in the questioning not on "the issue" but about HRC's position on the issue? #DemDebate
Awww, no one is giving Jim Webb the ball. #DemDebate
This debate is child's play for HRC. Her biggest challenge here is @andersoncooper, not the candidates. #DemDebate
Hillary's mistakes re: Iraq are on the record, but her experience here is going to trump the rest. #DemDebate
I'd like to see someone try to beat SECRETARY Clinton here. (hint: Ain't gonna happen...) #DemDebate
O'Malley doesn't want to get off of guns. That was his shining moment. #DemDebate
Is there no button to press or a line to call to vote O'Malley off? If we're gonna make it like reality tv, let's go all the way. #DemDebate
Wait - was he talking about Hillary shouting? Or was he talking about the audience? Please say the audience... #DemDebate
"It wasn't that complicated to me" re: gun legislation. Well done, Hillary. #DemDebate
I love when candidates talk about themselves in the third person. #DemDebate
@andersoncooper is not letting anyone run away from their record. #DemDebate
I don't know if that was the right first swing to take for Hillary, but I really love that she fearlessly took it. #DemDebate
Ahhh...Hillary contrasting herself with Bernie with patriotism. #DemDebate
Great explanation of democratic socialism from Sanders. Making it accessible and principle based. #DemDebate
"I'm a progressive. But I'm a progressive who likes to get things done." - Hilary #DemDebate

Hillary was polished but Bernie's passion won the opener. #DemDebate
Bernie is going in. Race, incarceration, education, and jobs. #DemDebate
O'Mally jumped right in, reaching out to key demos and standing w Obama's legacy. Strong, substantive start. #DemDebate
@AllySontSed LOL Yeah, I give up.
I'm really torn. I want to focus on what matters. The substance, the policy. And yet...this is just so awkward and hilarious. #DemDebate

"Apps won't change the world. They are just a demonstration of community will. That's what makes change." - Marnie Webb #NCoC2015

@Nero Lol Not evading. I was at the walk for the sign making. No reason to lie. The number was a copyerror &amp; there's nothing more to it.
@Nero I respect your right to that opinion. Others told me not to engage you at all but I thought that responding initially was a good idea.
@Nero Nope. Nothing was made up. Nothing else to say.
@Nero Lol 1. I answered your question hrs ago. No other explanation to give you.
@Nero but I wrote a piece about how a woman like me could still support an event like that.
@Nero if the piece were fully about the movement or if I had ever written on the topic before, I could understand.
@nero This is a bit much for a copy error that was admitted by me personally &amp; has nothing to do w the thesis of the piece dontcha think?
That's pretty impressive. 52 weeks parental leave??  https://t.co/g1PZtgTkB0

@Nero So again, an authentic thanks for catching the error, but there's no giant conspiracy. :)
@Nero the piece actually wasn't a recap of the march if you read it. It was about my story as a young Christian + the history of SlutWalks.
@Nero I appreciate the correction (and acknowledged it immediately) but don't get why the jump to conclusions.
@Nero It was a copyedit error. The piece was drafted using the registration number as a placeholder and didn't get changed.
@Verdius @Nero @TIME Amber's team claimed 15K registrants. Thanks for fact checking &amp; catching the error.
@Nero @TIME Ack. Good call. 15,000 REGISTRANTS. Thanks for the catch!!

Read @Pontifex full address to Congress here: http://t.co/qkSOGPHo5X #PopeInDC
"...so that as many young people as possible can inherit &amp; dwell in a land which has inspired so many people to dream." #PopeInDC #theend
A non-specific reference to marriage equality and then quickly moves to the family members that are most important: Young people. #PopeInDC
This is FASCINATING. A global religious leader tells Congress how to be good political leaders. Who else has this authority? #PopeInDC
"A good political leader always opts to initiate processes rather than possessing space." #PopeInDC
We must implement a  “culture of care &amp; integrated approach to combating poverty &amp; at the same time protecting nature". #PopeInDC
Right? He knows. He knows. #PopeInDC  https://t.co/4UOT1qHbif
"The yardstick we use for others will be the yardstick which time will use for us." #PopeInDC
"If we want life, let us give life. If we want opportunity, let us give opportunities." - #PopeInDC
@Pontifex on refugees: "We need to avoid a common temptation nowadays: to discard whatever proves troublesome." Whew. #PopeInDC #lifelesson
"I am confident that we can do this." - on accepting immigrants #PopeInDC Note the "We". Including Americans in common human family.
It's so rare to hear a speech addressing political issues with such absolute, simple moral conviction. It's refreshing. #PopeInDC
Congress was told not to interrupt the speech for applause, but broke that rule for "Most of us were once foreigners." #PopeInDC
Beautiful that he honored @repjohnlewis and his work for civil rights. Connected that to Dr. King's dream. #PopeInDC
"If politics must truly be at the service of the human person, it follows that it cannot be a slave to the economy &amp; finance” #PopeInDC
"Our efforts must aim at restoring hope, righting wrongs." &lt; Righting wrongs is a loaded phrase. Different than just doing right. #PopeInDC
His words are very simple but so pointed and weighty. "Summon the courage and intelligence"? Politicians should take note. #PopeInDC
"We are asked to summon the courage and the intelligence to resolve today’s many geopolitical and economic crises." #PopeInDC
"Must guard against the simplistic reductionism that sees only good or evil, or if you will, righteous or sinner." - #PopeInDC
@CapehartJ I was on the edge of my seat. :)
Focusing on 4 Americans: Abraham Lincoln, Martin Luther King, Dorothy Day and Thomas Merton as models for today. #PopeInDC
Just shouted out young people who face hardships "often, often as a result of the immaturity of adults." Truth AND shade. #PopeInDC
Said that the chief aim of politics is the common good and goes straight to discussing the vulnerable among us. #PopeInDC
He starts by telling Congress their responsibility. "You are called to defend &amp; preserve the dignity of your fellow citizens."#PopeInDC
Watch @Pontifex speaking now in front of Congress here: http://t.co/jP2aHkUyRG
It's so interesting to watch anyone receive greater fanfare than POTUS as he enters the chamber. The Pope has Congress lit. #PopeInDC

@imsojayded Yep. You know too.
THAT's when you send encouragement, prayers, $$, support. That's also how you honor the lives lost. By carrying their families through.
I think about that every time someone's death is elevated nationally. After the cameras, hashtags and t-shirts are gone, the family remains.
The public isn't there with you to go through the person's clothes. Or see their empty chair at dinner. Or take care of their bills.
Nothing. It's all over. Everyone leaves, moves on with their lives &amp; you, the family, are left to feel the absence in an unfathomable way.
My father was the pastor of our church &amp; a community leader. His death was in the paper, everyone came around &amp; it was huge deal. Then...
Sometimes when you lose a loved one and there's a lot of attention and fanfare around the death, it makes the aftermath even harder.
@profblmkelley Yep. I lost my father @ 16. I remember how "great" the service was. Doesn't matter. Still one of the worst days of your life.
@JEKranzberg No. It's because I can't get it out of my head. And in fact did then remember 1-6. lol

@jasoncblee @CharleneCac So yeah. To me this was strategic.
@jasoncblee @CharleneCac And now the Admin has to think of a response to the deluge of inquiries about this issue that didn't exist a wk ago
@jasoncblee @CharleneCac And personally, I am always moved by the actions of 1, sometimes even over a group. It takes courage and boldness.
@jasoncblee @CharleneCac Will her action automatically bring relief? No. But it raised an issue to nationally that wasn't there before.
@jasoncblee @CharleneCac In this case, activists had been trying to raise this issue "behind closed doors" for quite awhile. To no avail.
@jasoncblee @CharleneCac So here's the thing. There's no blanket, standardized ranking of tactics. Timing, issue, movement, etc. all matter.
