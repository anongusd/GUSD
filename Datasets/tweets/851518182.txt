@KailiJoy @Potterchik Yet, you won't hear @senatemajldr @LindseyGrahamSC, or any other @GOP member condemn Trump about this, his racist comments, his lies about El Paso being the most violent, or his attacks on the media, even after the attack at his rally last night on a BBC cameraman! Pitiful party!
@WCCO Because @CNN @MSNBC @ABC and others would rather talk about Trump's made up crisis at the border than the crisis of gun violence in this country, they play right into Trump's hands. It's why I stopped watching several months ago along with my family.
If @senatemajldr &amp; the @GOP ever thought Trump would make a deal, they're as crazy as Trump is. Trump &amp; his entire admin knew he wasn't going to, because if he did he would have nothing to rally his base in 2020. All Trump &amp; GOP have is the #TaxScam https://t.co/YdHeTGo2Og
@MollyJongFast What the hell else is new, Trump lies @senatemajldr @LindseyGrahamSC and the entire @GOP go along with him. Their so called family values left when Trump was a candidate, and the reason my 5 sisters and brother left the Republican party, not me, I've always been a Dem.
