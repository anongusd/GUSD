#TechGOP Social Networking 101 @DavidAll #RightON http://twurl.nl/nf46eb
Signing off for now - be sure to check out http://www.techrepublican.com for panel recaps. #righton
Missed out on @adrienneroyers fundraising panel? Get it here: http://bit.ly/1amx7m #righton
Music can be very powerful with online video #righton
Some of the best videos are homegrown - don't let $$ discourage you from jumping into online video. #righton
By all means, break the rules with online video - but definitely be consistent #righton
What works for print media, doesn't work for video #Righton
Think audio - You need a camera that you can plug a microphone into, not use the microphone that’s attached to the camera. #righton
Have good lighting! You can get one light and make it look a lot better than if you had no lighting at all #righton
Don't put the subject in center of the frame - Give lead room in the direction the person is looking #righton
When shooting video subjects - fill the frame with the person, activity, etc... #righton
Be a friendly interviewer #righton
Getting started with video: Set a budget. Write a script before shooting. Have an outsider review.
Why do people watch video? - Entertainment. Conservatives think we need to put a policy paper on video #righton
Looking forward to hearing from Beverly Hallberg - she is a well respected video production guru. #righton
Are you at RightOnline? Use #RightOn and join 1,000+ others at http://tweet.rightonline.com/
Where does @DavidAll stand on the Facebook v. Twitter war? "facebook is a walled garden" - "twitter is open" #righton
Some people can do high dives - others need to get their toes wet in the pool @DavidAll #righton
Up next - "Youtubing" Activism in Brighton @ 4 PM. Who's ready for @ToomeyforSenate #righton
I would argue that people are finding jobs on Linked-in, but they r also finding jobs via @facebook and @twitter #righton
Linked-in is the "professional" social network aka - *it's not fun.* @davidall #righton People aren't doing much there.
#TechGOP Blogging 101 @mattklewis #RightOn http://twurl.nl/umbk3s
Twitter is the new beat on the street for reporters @davidall #righton
The #handsoff hashtag is what I like to call the "twitter bomb" @davidall #righton
Liberals have nothing like #tcot @davidall #righton
Hashtags are the modern equivalent of the bumper stickers @davidall #righton
Top Conservatives on Twitter features more than 6,000 conservative Tweeters. Are you on the list? #tcot #righton
Twitter tools to make your life easier: Tweet Deck and HootSuite 2.0 #righton
First image of the Hudson plane crash was uploaded via a twitpic #righton
http://twitpic.com/7hzlk = "Twitter is a player in Iran's drama" #righton
Could the next Zapruder Film spread via Twitter? It already has @davidall #righton
Talking Twash = Talking trash on @twitter #righton
People spend their time into unique online watering holes @davidall #righton
Why does this matter? - Facebook has more users than the population of Indonesia #righton
@davidall bc of the Internet and bc we're never turning back - we need to figure out these new mediums quickly and start moving #righton
Get the Twitter 101 Guide at www.twitter101guide.com #righton
Build....but what? Tools mean nothing without a strategy #righton
redefinition of activism into a world that we now live in where a click represents activism #righton
And now for Modern Activism 101....@DavidAll the floor is yours #righton
@DavidAll founded @TechRepublican -- Woot #righton #techgop
Do you have the @davidall Soc Net 101: Twitter & Facebook Guide? #RightOn
Next @leadershipinst lecture - @davidall on Social Networking 101 in Brighton. Come on over y'all. #righton
Get your name on Twitter. It doesn't cost you a dime. "Some slacker has Matt Lewis - I'm @mattklewis and I'm a little ticked off" #righton
Years ago this lecture used to be called "What is the Internet" @mattklewis #righton
Where to start: www.wordpress.com - There will be a button that says start a blog. Click it. @mattklewis #righton
What is your passion? In Adam Brickley's case (Draft Sarah Palin) it was chicks that wear glasses #righton
"There's really good creativity going on in parent's basements around the country" #righton
Hook other people up - link to other people and they will link to you (if they're not selfish :) ) - Same goes for retweets #righton
How do you get people to follow you on Twitter? Follow them back @mattklewis #righton
Monitor and respond to comments. You cannot afford to not look at them. #righton
@mattklewis "I am my own public relations firm" #righton
Respond to comments. #righton
Get social - get involved in the blogging community - build authentic relationships #righton
Build up credibility - "do not go off half-cocked" @mattklewis. Fact Check. #righton
The macaca story "rocked the political world" for a week #righton // I would argue longer than that - we're still talking about it.
Have the Tools: iPhone, Flip Camera, etc... #righton
This conference is a network - take advantage of it #righton
Twitter is the best way to get answers to your questions and fast. #righton
How do we get traction? Your content has to be exciting -- Pictures r better than words, videos r better than pictures #righton
RT @ DavidAll Conservative blog guru @mattklewis trains over a hundred new bloggers http://twitpic.com/dvhqm #righton
When bloggers get together, you start to build a case that these politicians are OUT OF TOUCH and people start to listen #righton
@aaronmarks @katiefavazza @katys @kerpen = worthy competition :) #righton
Big-name bloggers aren't the ones breaking stories - it's local, real people doing the grassroots online community organizing #righton
RT @seanhackbarth Proposed panel for next #righton: Story-telling 101 // I like it.
Blogging gives the mainstream media permission to write about things #righton
1/2 of the room has their own blog - the other 1/2 are going to start #righton
ND has ONE, count it, 1 conservative blog - amazing the opportunity you can have #righton
Now is the perfect time for conservative doctors to capitalize on their expertise, online - @mattklewis #righton #handsoff
Why should anyone read your blog? What is your unique proposition? #righton
Find a Niche in the Blogosphere: What is your expertise? Your angle? Get Local #RightOn @mattklewis
With a blog, you own a printing press and a broadcast system #RightOnline
"The left doesn't have the swagger they had in recent history" @mattklewis #righton
"We are winning and the wind is at our back" @mattklewis #righton
@mattklewis now speaking on Blogging 101 #RightOn
#TechGOP #RightOn -- Opening Panel: Winning in a Web 2.0 World http://twurl.nl/lqvhpk
Conservatives speak logic - Liberals use emotion. We sometimes get a little too wonky #RightOn
Up next, I'm attending @leadershipinst training - Blogging 101 in Brighton with @mattklewis #righton
Trainers need to change techno-jardon into words that novices can understand and relate to. #RightOn
Twitter is the place to spread breaking news, virally. #RightOn
Engage the community & meet more people online. The more people you can engage in conversation, the better #RightOn
Nearly the entire room gets political news from the blogosphere #RightOn
Modern media is not about knowing how to use the tools - it's about engaging in authentic conversations. #RightOn
Politics is like an ocean - sometimes can't control it, but the tide is coming in and we need to capture the energy online #RightOn
Getting GOP candidates to raise $$ is like "hearding cats in a yarn factory in a flood" #RightOn
@RightWingNews not about having the best technology - it's taking advantage of the wave. the Obama yrs r the wave @RightOn
@EmZannotti last year was about catching up to the left online - this year, conservatives are embracing technology #RightOn
@afphq already has 1,000 local activists signed up to participate in its Send Specter a Message Rally. #RightOn
In Brighton, waiting for the opening panel on Winning in a Web 2.0 World to begin #RightOn @TechGOP
