We must continue to stand with allies like France and hold Iran accountable under the framework of the #IranDeal. The world already has one rogue nuclear threat in North Korea ‚Äì there is no reason to create another one.
Earlier this month, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Gen. Dunford, told me during an Armed Services Committee hearing that Iran continues to abide by the terms of the deal.
The deal has, and will continue to, prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon, and has subjected Iran to unprecedented monitoring. Just last month, the commander of U.S. forces in the Middle East told Congress ‚Äúit is in our interest to stay in the Iran nuclear deal.‚Äù
Macron is encouraging us to do something smart: keep Iran from getting a nuke. Trump has called for the #IranDeal to be ‚Äòripped up,‚Äô which gives Iran free reign to build a bomb. Let‚Äôs join with our allies and keep the deal while pressuring Iran on Hezbollah, Syria, missiles, etc.
It's an honor to welcome President @EmmanuelMacron to a joint session of Congress this morning. America is fortunate to have a strong bilateral relationship with France despite the chaos in our White House.

Anyone who uses chemical weapons should be stopped. That includes Assad and the Russians. But we‚Äôve seen this before, we‚Äôve tried this response before, and it clearly failed. We need a strategy, Mr. President, not a series of contradictory tweets.

It is past time for the President to present a clear strategy for our role going forward, and for Congress to debate a new authorization for military force in Syria. Failing to do so is not fair to our service members risking their lives every day or to the American public.
America is at our best when we lead based on our principles. We have seen a lot of mixed messages from the White House, but no strategy and no leadership. We have read a lot of tweets, but see no plans to act with compassion, and save refugees while we still can.
The Assad regime‚Äôs chemical attack on civilians is a heinous war crime. We must work with our international partners to further isolate the regime and its sole remaining backers - Iran and Russia - and hold them accountable for their actions.
Sorry to hear that, Saba. One example is a requirement in the omnibus spending bill that passed a few weeks ago that all veterans be entitled to mental health screening and care and that the VA provide an annual report to Congress. But the simple answer is not enough. https://t.co/RDZV394Jj4

In my short time in Congress, I‚Äôve learned it‚Äôs a lot easier to find a reason to vote against something than to vote for something. Although the omnibus bill contained provisions I wouldn‚Äôt support on their own, I believe it addresses important priorities overall.
We‚Äôre still not doing nearly enough to prepare Americans to succeed in the economy of the future. We should be investing a lot more in apprenticeships and skills education ‚Äì programs like the one my #CHANCEinTech Act would create. https://t.co/QiMtmda4LZ
There are a lot of good things in the #omnibus, but it‚Äôs not perfect. It includes funding for the border wall, which experts agree is not an effective way to secure our border (and which @realDonaldTrump promised MEXICO would pay for, not taxpayers).
This bill grants the Army Corps of Engineers the resources our community needs for future harbor maintenance projects in Newburyport.
One of my top priorities in Congress is making sure every American who wants to serve our country has the opportunity to do so. This bill advances that goal by increasing the budget of the Corporation for National and Community Service, which runs programs like @AmeriCorps.
It includes critical health care resources: new funding to combat the opioid crisis, more resources for our Community Health Centers, and more funding to train Sexual Assault Nurse Examiners. There's currently no SANE in my district, so I'll fight to bring this funding to #MA6.
No matter what @realDonaldTrump says, Russia is an adversary and a threat ‚Äì look no further than their invasion of Crimea. That‚Äôs why I‚Äôve been calling for us to support our allies by fully funding the European Resilience Initiative, which this bill does.
This bill supports our troops: it gives them a pay increase. (And, it rejects a pay increase for Members of Congress like me.)
The omnibus includes $30 million in grants for collaborative partnerships and research to address coastal resiliency. The man-made threat of climate change is threatening coastal #MA6 communities, and these resources will help us adapt.
This bill funds a pilot program to extend broadband internet to rural areas. I‚Äôve been calling for this for years, and I introduced legislation to help small businesses access high speed internet. https://t.co/99FeBrpl3i

On paper, @ConorLambPA shouldn't have stood a chance in this district that voted for Republicans by 20 points in the last election. This turnout is the result of the hard work of volunteers and activists. I saw that energy and excitement in #PA18 last weekend.

If this #taxscam bill passes, let's take it as a call to action to bring a new generation of Democratic leadership to Congress that will have the courage to stand up to the lobbyist and donor class and give power back to the American people. 6/6
When Democrats take back Congress, we must pass tax reform that will:		‚Ä¢ invest in the middle class (not assault it)	‚Ä¢ grow the new businesses that are driving our economy (not corporate monopolies)	‚Ä¢ favor working American families (not lobbyists and political donors)		5/x
The only real input on this #taxscam came from major GOP donors. This bill threatens the economy and our national security. The way it's being passed threatens our democratic government.		All of this reinforces why I'm working to bring a new generation of leaders to Congress. 4/x
.@GOP controls the House, the Senate, and the White House, so if they were proud of their #taxscam bill, they would've let it stand up to public scrutiny through the normal congressional process of hearings and debate (something @SpeakerRyan promised us when he was sworn in). 3/x
This partisan bill gives a permanent tax cut to the largest corporations and richest GOP donors‚Äîpaid for by the middle class. In coming years, the wealthiest will see more money in their pockets, but most families will see taxes and healthcare costs rise and paychecks fall. 2/x
I'm on the House floor for the terrible tax vote. Republicans are jamming a tax bill down all our throats without a single hearing, zero bipartisan input, and without listening at all to the American families and small businesses it will ruin. 1/x

Congress owes it to victims of gun violence to debate and vote on bipartisan, common sense proposals to improve gun safety. #HR38 is scheduled for a vote this week and it would accomplish the exact opposite, creating a race to the bottom for #ConcealedCarry laws.
This bill and this process represent the worst in D.C. @SenateGOP presented no vision for economic growth. America is better than this. We can cut taxes for the middle class without giving the store away to the 1%. Let's be leaders and actually do it!
We should be coming together to have a real debate about tax reform, not fighting in the middle of the night and pushing through bills that double-down on the failed economic policies of the past. #TaxScamBill

Every time you hear that the #TaxScam cuts taxes, ask if it's in year one or in *every year*.		Under the House-passed bill, in Massachusetts, 55% of the tax benefits will go to households in just the top 1% of income by 2027. We're better than this.

I'm all for better vetting. Nothing in Trump's #MuslimBan does that. And it hurts our troops' ability to get intel against the terrorists.

Tillerson's one redeeming quality is that, unlike Trump, he at least has the courage to openly display his blatant conflicts of interest.
Tillerson's nomination sends a clear signal to our enemies that American foreign policy is up for sale.
Make no mistake: Russia is our enemy. Rex Tillerson has actively undermined US foreign policy toward Russia in order to line his own pockets
Tillerson has made a fortune cutting deals with some of the world's great tyrants and shows neither the talent nor temperament for diplomacy
Rather than appoint a serious and respected diplomat to lead the State Department, Trump has outsourced the job to an oil baron.
