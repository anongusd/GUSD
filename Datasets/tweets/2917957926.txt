We have heard that the nation is behind abolishing ICE, and we must #AbolishICE. That doesn‚Äôt mean we lose security at our borders ‚Äî it means immigration reform is absolutely essential for Congress to pass ‚Äî our system is broken. #MN05 #D5MNForum
A $15 min. wage is one crucial part in addressing the problem of inequality in U.S. In example, access to healthcare is part of this upward mobility. We also need to look at opportunities for training, apprenticeship programs, and the careers of the future. #MN05 #D5MNForum
We need to invest in our kids ‚Äî not military weapons we won‚Äôt use. We have millennials who can‚Äôt afford to pay for housing, or to raise a family ‚Äî this is a tragedy. We bail out banks, auto companies ‚Äî it‚Äôs time we bail out our kids and the next generation. #MN05 #D5MNForum
I actually came to the @HHHSchool to learn and work with numbers and statistics that can help us at the state and federal level craft policy and legislation. Leaders need to have this experience working directly on these issues in order to get these done. #MN05 #D5MNForum
Healthcare disparities are one of the most important questions we need to address. I‚Äôve been talking about it for 27 years. Without connections to different perspectives and to communities of color, without bringing them to the table, we‚Äôll never address it. #MN05 #D5MNForum
If you look at the disparities that exist in MN, we have the best indicators of well being ‚Äî but when you separate people of color and indigenous people from that equation, we‚Äôre towards the last. We need leaders committed to ending this once and for all. #MN05 #D5MNForum
Take a look at our campaign funding reports, and that will give you the answer on where we stand ‚Äî if we‚Äôre interested in serving the people of Minnesota, or insurance companies who want to stop #SinglePayer. #MN05 #D5MNForum
It‚Äôs simple. We have the resources in place to pay for #SinglePayer healthcare, and we have the policy to propose to take care of it. It‚Äôs up to us to act responsibly in enacting this plan, and to legislate accordingly. #MN05 #D5MNForum
Building a coalition of support for carbon pricing is something I am behind 100%. Additionally we must focus on carbon reduction. I think the coalition is in place - in example, the next generation is choosing to use multiple transit forms instead of driving. #MN05 #D5MNForum

Where can I work with POTUS? Well, I believe he's closed the door on conversations and actions on key issues #MN05 cares about. He's going in the opposite direction of what most people want in our district, on #immigration, #education, #climatechange, to name a few issues. #MNDFL
Public #education is a bedrock of our democracy. We have a massive economic divide that exists because not enough kids and families have access to quality public education. Now, our public schools are under attack by Betsy DeVos and the Trump Administration. #MNDFL #MN05
We have urgent issues to address. The vicious targeting of our immigrant communities has to stop, and we need to address the disgusting atrocities taking place at our southern border today, now. This is not new. This has been happening for years. #MN05 #MNDFL
My career started when I came to this country 32 years ago. I arrived here with no connections -- no ability to speak and connect to find them. I had to work hard to get to where I am today. I organized, went to school, started a family, and built coalitions. #MN05 #MNDFL
I believe that we are in the fight of our time. Everyone knows that #Trump and the Republican majority in Congress are doing harm to our country -- they're pursuing policies of cruelty. In this moment, I can't stand by, and I'm prepared to go to Washington, D.C. #MN05 #MNDFL
