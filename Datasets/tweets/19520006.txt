Great breakdown and analysis of crypto market with bonus quote or two from @joerazz ;) https://t.co/xVdMuDHM1M
#jayclayton at #ConsensusInvest says #blockchain has incredible promise. The reason we don't have a #Bitcoin #etf is because the exchanges don't have safeguards like the NASDAQ. @joerazz https://t.co/ieTaClLq12
@CaitlinLong_ says every security issued will be in a #crypto form to avoid the Dole stock debacle - more stock holders than stock available. #ConsensusInvest @thomsonreuters @joerazz https://t.co/imBfAA0tHL
@ricedelman says in order for #Cryptocurrency to take off, we have to get the 26,000 investment advisors educated on #crypto. #ConsensusInvest @joerazz @Reuters https://t.co/agGlNhmhHo
At #ConsensusInvest interview with @andrewrsorkin - Dr. Mohammad A. El-Erian says #crypto will never be a currency - it's a commodity. @joerazz Not sure about that. https://t.co/1OP3rFFNsM
