2. Stony Rushing's lawsuit, however, had no basis in fact. He presented no evidence his ex-lover ever even contacted his daughter. 		It was an apparent effort to paint his ex-lover as a "psycho stalker" before news of the affair spread 		https://t.co/7NyoBTKswM

@joshsternberg Thanks Josh!
Stony Rushing, candidate for Congress in NC, filed suit against his lover, alleging she stalked his tween daughter		There was no evidence to support the suit. It was an apparent effort to paint her as a "psycho stalker" before people learned of the affair https://t.co/7NyoBTKswM
@Real_Moon_King It doesn't. It's a one-person operation so I just use this account.

8. Rushing would not admit to the affair when I asked him. He did, however, promise an exclusive interview on "his sex life from virginity until today" if I got Democrat Dan McCready to answer three questions https://t.co/7NyoBTKswM
7. I talked with Rushing today and asked him what evidence he had that Wesolek had stalked his daughter. He said he wasn't supposed to discuss it as part of the judge's order. 		This is false. The judge dismissed the case and issued no further orders. 		https://t.co/7NyoBTKswM
6. Wesolek's attorney, John Snyder, told me that prior to the suit, news of the affair was circulating in political circles. Rushing filed the suit to try to paint Wesolek as a "psycho stalker" and provide himself with political cover https://t.co/7NyoBTKswM
5. Rushing represented himself, and called himself as the first witness. After admitting the affair and presenting no evidence (except for Facebook postsnot even written by Wesolek) the judge dismissed his case. 		So why did Rushing file the suit? 		https://t.co/7NyoBTKswM
4. In the deposition, Rushing offered no evidence that Wesolek stalked his daughter OR EVEN COMMUNICATED WITH HER AT ALL		Even so, he insisted on going to trial. So that's what happened. 		https://t.co/7NyoBTKswM
3. But the complaint didn't disclose that Rushing had an affair with Wesolek and, prior to filing the complaint, professed his love for her		You don't have to take my word for it. Rushing himself was forced to admit it when he was deposed for the case. 		https://t.co/7NyoBTKswM https://t.co/NHweaXCcds
2. Rushing filed a complaint on behalf of his tween daughter against Tracy Wesolek, who was active in GOP politics.		The complaint sought a NO-CONTACT ORDER FOR STALKING OR NON-CONSENSUAL SEXUAL CONDUCT		It referenced assault, molestation, and stalking. 		https://t.co/7NyoBTKswM

"The president directed transactions, in conspiracy with Allen Weisselberg and his son, Donald Trump Jr., as part of a criminal conspiracy of financial fraud" -- @RoKhanna

@kathrynw5 That's totally fair
@kathrynw5 Might want to note here that Burkman and Wohl are notorious fraudsters and charlatans
This is a very odd line of questioning by this Republican Congressman, who is suggesting Trump didn't reimburse Cohen for his payments to Stormy Daniels. 		Trump's current attorney, Rudy Giuliani, has publicly said that Trump reimbursed Cohen.		It's not in dispute.
I'm not sure why Democrats need to be character witnesses for Cohen. He's not a good guy. But he does know a lot of stuff about Trump and he has receipts.

Mark Meadows said he has talked to Trump over 300 times and never heard him say anything racist.		Did he hear Trump call the participants in a white supremacist march "very fine people"? https://t.co/wEutr1F1i3
Republican strategy just seems to be to repeatedly call Cohen a liar.
"Mr. Trump had frequently told me and others that his son Don Jr. had the worst judgment of anyone in the world..."
"The President of the United States thus wrote a personal check for the payment of hush money as part of a criminal scheme to violate finance laws."		Seems bad when you put it that way.

Cohen's claims about Trump's knowledge of Wikileaks is consistent with the indictment of Stone		Cohen's claim about the hush money payment is backed up by a copy of the check signed by Trump		And Cohen's claim Trump knew about the Trump Tower meeting is consistent w/common sense
Cohen's prepared testimony is devastating to Trump. Cohen says:		1. Trump was told in advance of the Wikileaks email dump by Stone 		2. Don Jr. told Trump in advance about his meeting with Russians		3. Trump personally signed checks reimbursing him for illegal hush money payment
CNN has a copy of the check and it was a personal check. Still bad though.

10. Mindy McGillivray. Says Trump groped her while she was attending a concert at Mar-a-lago in 2003.
9. Rachel Crooks. Says she was assaulted by Trump in an elevator in Trump Tower in 2005.
8. Jessica Leeds. Said Trump lifted up the armrest, grabbed her breasts and reached his hand up her skirt in the early 1980s.
7. Kristin Anderson. Said Trump reached under her skirt and grabbed her vagina through her underwear in the early 1990s.
6. Summer Zervos. Apprentice contestant says Trump started kissing her and grabbing her breasts, began "thrusting his genitals." 2007.
5. Cathy Heller. Says Trump grabbed her and attempted to kiss her at Mar-a-lago in 1997.
4. Karena Virginia. Says she was groped by Trump at the U.S. Open in 1998.
3. Jessica Drake. Said Trump grabbed and kissed her without consent, then offered her 10K for sex in 2006.
2. Ninni Laaksonen, former Miss Finland. ‚ÄúTrump stood right next to me and suddenly he squeezed my butt‚Äù in July 2006.
1. Today seems like a good day to remember all the women who have accused Trump of sexual assault. 		Just because he became president doesn't make their stories any less important
7. But more important than Acosta's illegal acts is the fact that Epstein is now a free man, living on a private island in the U.S. Virgin Islands. 		Girls are at risk. 		He needs to finally be prosecuted, in Florida or elsewhere.		https://t.co/Y9nEIezKu3
6. Trump was friends with Epstein and joked about his sexual habits. 		"I've known Jeff for fifteen years. Terrific guy. He's a lot of fun to be with. It is even said that he likes beautiful women as much as I do, and many of them are on the younger side"		https://t.co/Y9nEIezKu3
5. Should someone who broke the law to protect a serial pedophile be in charge of overseeing child trafficking laws? 		That's the situation we find ourselves in with Acosta. 		Trump has brushed it off, saying it happened "a long time ago."		https://t.co/Y9nEIei95t
4. To give Epstein this sweetheart deal Acosta BROKE THE LAW, according to a federal judge. He agreed to not contact the victims about the plea deal even though it is required under the Crime Victims Rights Act. 		Acosta has not explained why he did this. https://t.co/Y9nEIezKu3
3. Epstein ended up serving 13 months. But most of that time wasn't even spent behind bars. He was allowed to spend 12 hours a day in a luxury office he set up on "work release." This was allowed even though sex offenders aren't eligible for work release		https://t.co/Y9nEIezKu3
2. As U.S. Attorney in Miami, Acosta could have put Epstein away for life. Instead, he agreed not to prosecute Epstein in exchange for him pleading guilty to two prostitution counts. 		Epstein's victims were not prostitutes. They were girls. 		https://t.co/Y9nEIezKu3

5. He had just conducted this interview in Dowless kitchen, a fact that @NickOchsnerWBTV did not reveal to viewers, and then pretends like no one has heard from this guy 		Britt says Dowless told her that Nick was "a friend" and he would like her to speak to him.
4. But here is the thing: in the segment, @NickOchsnerWBTV DOES NOT reveal that the interview took place in Dowless' kitchen or that Dowless was present		Nick ends the segment by saying: "We have still yet to hear publicly from the man that Lisa Britt worked for, McCrae Dowless"
3. Later, when Britt talked to the committee she admitted that yes, Dowless had paid her to collect ballots, which is against the law. 		She explained that she lied during the interview because IT TOOK PLACE IN DOWLESS' KITCHEN WITH DOWLESS PRESENT https://t.co/2sivelurbG

BREAKING: The North Carolina Election board has ordered a new election in the 9th Congressional district.		Republican Mark Harris' campaign engaged in systemic election fraud.		Harris himself called for a new election after the hearing began to reveal potentially criminal conduct
I'm particularly interested in the fact that, in his statement, Harris volunteers that he is struggled with "recall and confusion" during his testimony.		It's almost like he is trying to come up with  an explanation if he's caught lying

4. Once the campaign started Harris paid Dowless through a consultant, so Dowless' name never appeared on any FEC report		At the time, Patriots for Progress could not legally accept donation from anyone because it had stopped filing reports.
3. First, candidates aren't permitted  to work directly with independent expenditure PACs. 		Second, the payment was made before Harris was officially a candidate. That's OK, but once he ran he was required to report all expenses like this. Harris never did.
2. The check is initially how Harris paid Dowless for his campaign work		Harris paid wrote the check to Patriots for Progress, a PAC controlled by Dowless. 		He did a lot of stuff wrong here.
1. Why is Mark Harris now calling for a new election in a race where he was ahead?		The fraud didn't seem to bother him		This check is a problem, however https://t.co/3x8D6KNfF2

Congressional candidate Mark Harris (also a minister) says he was "a pastoral figure" to the guy who was running an election fraud scheme for him in Bladen County. He claims their frequent phone calls did not include substantive discussions of Dowless' work. https://t.co/UrcBUpqjOt
Big Trouble for Mark Harris. He hired Dowless, the man at the center for the election fraud scandal, before other campaign staff. Harris paid him through a donation to Dowless' PAC, Patriots for Progress		Candidates can't coordinate directly with PACs. Could be an FEC violation. https://t.co/GDzRMyWEy4

4. It was an amazing moment of integrity for John Harris		His dad signed up someone he was warned was a criminal because he was so desperate to win 		John Harris just told the truth 		For more sign up for my newsletter at https://t.co/JhoV1QDaTS
3. One important point was that Mark Harris and his legal team tried to hide all of this from investigators		John Harris said his dad‚Äôs attorneys told him they had turned over the emails		Then he found out that never happened		So he did it himself 		https://t.co/Dkof34zqZo
2. John Harris laid out in meticulous detail how he had warned his father for YEARS that McCrae Dowless was breaking the law and tried to convince him not to hire him		He had the emails to prove it		It was devestating		By the end, Mark Harris was crying 		https://t.co/Dkof34zqZo
1. What happened yesterday in North Carolina was one of the most extraordinary things I‚Äôve ever seen in politics.		For months, Mark Harris claimed he was SHOCKED to learn a campaign operative was running an election fraud scheme 		Then his son testified 		https://t.co/Dkof34zqZo
A Dutch historian told Tucker Carlson that he was a millionaire funded by billionaires who scapegoated immigrants instead of talking about real economic issues		Carlson had no rebuttal. He just responded with a string of invective.		"Why don't you go fuck yourself"		Remarkable.
Wow. https://t.co/Pw09Hzk2pB
Hi @IvankaTrump 		Thought you might be interested in this.		FWIW, just because someone is your dad, doesn't mean you have to be complicit in illegal conduct. 		You can set your own standards and tell the truth. https://t.co/DH7tLw4HSL
Wow. The emails between Mark Harris and his son, John Harris, were extremely damning.		When his son found them in December, Mark Harris' lawyers said they'd already been provided to investigators. 		Then in January, John learned that never happened.		https://t.co/ZS1tAXjR4L

3. Trump celebrated the National Enquirer's publication of the Bezos texts, praising their reporting 		https://t.co/eceDzui0be
2. AMI/National Enquirer has admitted in federal court that it acted as an arm of Trump's political operation -- buying negative stories about Trump to keep them from going public and attacking his enemies https://t.co/CvfNUr8Qm9
1. The subtext in Bezos' post yesterday was the potential involvement of Trump in both: 1. the publication of Bezos' texts to his mistress and, 2. the efforts by AMI/National Enquirer to shut Bezos up w/threats		We know how this operation works

2. The Trump admin has  conceded these separations were ILLEGAL. It made an effort to identify and reunite separated children who were in HHS custody as of June 26, 2018.		But there were thousands more who, before that date, were placed with "sponsors"		https://t.co/EOALS77FdA

4. There are no details on how much manufacturing will be done, how much capital will be invested or when the promised jobs will be created. 		And yet it was covered like a major development and reversal		https://t.co/nAkobTVQDI
3. The original announcement by Foxconn said that the new plan  was to do a mix of manufacturing and R&amp;D (mostly R&amp;D) and it shouldn't be called a factory		The revised announcement also says the exact same thing! They just call it a factory again		https://t.co/nAkobTVQDI
2. Trump talked with Foxconn Chairman Terry Gou. Soon after, Foxconn released a new statement saying the factory was back on! 		That generated headlines like this.		But what REALLY happened		https://t.co/nAkobTVQDI https://t.co/djBTSlOMHv
1. Pace of news is fast but the details matter. Last week Foxconn announced it was canceling its plans to build an LCD factory is Wisconsin -- an embarrassing development for the Trump administration that touted the deal 		So Trump got on the phone 		https://t.co/nAkobTVQDI

RT @JuddLegum: The NFL is an entire league that iced out a talented quarterback because he protested racism
This predictably gives Trump an opening to serve up a word salad about the economy. Specific questions could get to the heart of the issue and not allow Trump to dodge the issue. Example:		Do you think Steve King should resign?
The CBS interview of Trump is exact wrong way to do it. The questions are way too broad. For example:		In a CBS poll we just took, 63 percent of Americans say they disapprove about how you're handling issues of race in the US. What do you think of that?

Donald Trump has still not commented on Steve King embracing white nationalism. He was asked once and said he didn't know what King said (after it dominated the news for an entire day.) Hasn't addressed it since.

For Northam this totally different black face incident is better because he didn't use much shoe polish: "I had just a little bit a shoe polish and the reason I used a very little bit is because I don‚Äôt don‚Äôt know if anybody has ever tried that but you cannot get shoe polish off"
So Northam apologized for appearing in a black face photo in his med school yearbook but now says he's not resigning because it's not him and he doesn't even know how the photo got there but he's still sorry because he once dressed up in black face at a totally different party
That he thinks it matters whether or not it‚Äôs him in the photo is revealing https://t.co/HTrEYZoP3s

@derekwillis I guess I just have less faith in Parscale to give a completely accurate accounting of how the money is being spent.
@derekwillis I'll stand by my description of the filing as unusual. If you can find another example of an incumbent president with a $100 million annual burn rate two years before the election, while only taking in 7 million for the quarter, I'll take it back
@derekwillis It was controversial when Romney did it: https://t.co/MeuM1CaZfi
@derekwillis But we really don't know how the money was spent because it's all concealed through the LLC. Do we know for sure it was used to boost GOP in the general election?
@TheAntho815 It's moving pretty slowly. Could be some action this month: https://t.co/mdlef2dt1x

3. The purpose of the FEC reports is so the public can see how campaign funds are spent. American Made Media Consultants, LLC is just a legal fiction created to obscure how the Trump campaign is spending its money. And it's spending A LOT. 		Where is it all going?
2. Much of this spending is completely opaque. Over $8 million went to American Made Media Consultants, LLC, a firm started last year by campaign manager Brad Parscale to buy ads and other stuff for the campaign. 		Another $690,000 went to Parscale's personal consulting firm
1. Donald Trump's reelection campaign just posted their FEC filing and it's very odd. 		It's two years out and the campaign is spending way more than its taking it.		Over the last 3 months of 2018 it raised about 7 million and spent 23 million!

4. The cost here is not only the layoffs but the opaque influence on the nature of coverage when people fear for their jobs. 		It's hard enough to report critically on advertisers -- often powerful companies -- in the best of circumstances.
3. I also think it's worth examining the trade-offs when journalistic outlets are funded by venture capital or controlled by large corps 		These models can inject a lot of cash into journalism but they are also don't really care about journalism. Layoffs are an inevitability.

6. There is a tendency to treat this like sporting event. This media outlet lost the day! Trump wins the day!		But there is an underlying truth that goes to the heart of our democracy. 		We still don't know the truth and we deserve the truth.
5. Mueller keeps his work secret as it goes along to preserve the integrity of the process.		But ultimately these are matters of PUBLIC CONCERN		At some point (hopefully soon) Mueller will release the transcript and we can all judge whether BuzzFeed's description is accurate
4. This ambiguity can be resolved by releasing the transcript. 		Many people are confidently declaring that BuzzFeed's piece is garbage. BuzzFeed maintains its true. 		But how can anyone really have a view without reading this transcript?
3. There is clearly some ambiguity about what Cohen told Congress. His lawyer wrote at one point that Cohen lied about the Moscow project "in accordance with Client-1‚Äôs directives" (Client-1 is Trump)		But in his allocation to the court, Cohen did not say he was directed by Trump
2. We know Cohen talked to Mueller's office and we know they discussed Cohen's decision to lie to Congress about when the pursuit of Trump's Moscow ended.		But what did Cohen say?		This isn't a mystery. There is a transcript. Sometime soon, the transcript should be released.
1. Some perspective on the BuzzFeed controversy		The central claim in BuzzFeed's story that Mueller disputes is this: Cohen "told the special counsel that after the election, the president personally instructed him to lie"		Mueller says Buzzfeed's "description" is "not accurate"
Counter-offer: Open the government https://t.co/qmss7QRG9n
A man slashes your car tire and then demands you buy him a Rolex.		You refuse and then he offers to ‚Äútemporarily‚Äù patch your tire if you buy him a Rolex.		Trump thinks this is what it means to ‚Äúcompromise‚Äù
If Trump offers temporary protections to Dreamers with no path to citizenship that‚Äôs not a deal. Courts have already struck down his efforts to repeal DACA and the Supreme Court may not bail him out. Temporarily undoing damage HE CAUSED is not compromise. https://t.co/eemHobKSjQ
@joshsternberg @JamieOGrady It differs somewhat from the descriptions in various legal filings, which says Cohen lies to be consistent with Trump‚Äôs messaging but doesn‚Äôt say he was directly ordered to do so by Trump. So that could be part of it
It‚Äôs worth noting that this statement is very specific and lawyerly. It seems to acknowledge that they‚Äôve obtained testimony and documents related to Trump‚Äôs communication with Cohen on the Moscow project but dispute BuzzFeed‚Äôs ‚Äúcharacterization.‚Äù We‚Äôll have to wait and see.

Which raises the question of how many felonies you can commit and still be president. Seems like a lot.
Yes, the Buzzfeed article, if true, means Mueller has caught Trump committing multiple felonies to avoid the truth getting out about his relationship with Russia		But remember: Trump has already been named as an unindicted co-conspirator in an entirely separate set of felonies

5. Meanwhile, there is another law - the Fair Labor Standards Act - that says everyone who works needs to be paid a minimum wage 		Forcing people to work and not paying them is a clear violation of the language of the FLSA		https://t.co/wus3zDyt4D

VIDEO		JULY 11, 2006		Steve King goes on the House floor and argues for the construction of 2000 mile southern border wall 		He says the top should have an electrified wire and compares immigrants to livestock	 	He constructs a model of the wall as he delivers the speech https://t.co/WpAMWpWMzB
King finished his 7/11/06 speech by comparing immigrants to livestock: "We could also electrify this wire with the kind of current that would not kill somebody, but it would simply be a discouragement for them to be fooling around with it. We do that with livestock all the time." https://t.co/et9ckX8asm
3. More King (7/11/06): "Our little construction company could build a mile a day of this pretty easily, once you‚Äôve got your system going. The whole two thousand miles are not going to work that way, but a lot of it will work this way"
2. Here is what King said July 11, 2006: "So when I get down there and sit on that border, what I do is I come to this conclusion, we can‚Äôt shut that off unless we build a fence and a wall. I want to put the fence in, but I want to put a wall in, and I designed one. "
1. It's important to understand that the 2000 mile border wall is not Trump's idea. 		It is Steve King's idea. How do I know? I wrote about it 13 YEARS AGO. 		King went to the House floor and actually constructed a model wall. 		https://t.co/lFI8MD7sSs https://t.co/5A8MBYqHmy

"There will not be another government shutdown. You can count on that. Shutting down the government, in my view, is not conservative policy. I don‚Äôt think a two-week paid vacation for federal employees is conservative policy.‚Äù -- Mitch McConnell, Oct 2013 https://t.co/DFl8dC4pj2
Trump asked directly to address the hundreds of thousands of government workers who aren‚Äôt getting paid.		He ignores the questions. Goes on a rant about impeachment.

3. But there are already a couple of Republican Senators urging McConnell to pass a bill without the $5 billion in wall funding. 		McConnell just has to decide how long he wants this to last.
2. Anything that comes out of the Senate has to be bipartisan. The Senate unanimously passed a funding bill without wall funding a few days ago. McConnell could do it again.		He‚Äôs not because his loyalty to Trump is stronger than any pressure he feels to end the shutdown.
1. The shutdown is billed as a battle of wills between Schumer/Pelosi &amp; Trump.		This is the wrong way to look at it. Schumer/Pelosi don‚Äôt want to fund the wall but even if they did, they would be hard pressed to corral the necessary Democratic votes.		This is all about McConnell.

15. Defending his 2012 embrace of Trump, Romney said the birther conspiracy is NOT racist. 		It wasn't "xenophobic or racist or misogynist. It wasn't bigoted," he said in a 2012 interview. 		Romney is not the one you've been waiting for.		https://t.co/9W7psawumw
14. Now that Romney is joining the U.S. Senate he is recasting himself as a Trump critic. He said he will call Trump out when he is racist. 		What does Romney consider racist?		https://t.co/9W7psawumw
13. When he differed from Trump it was only from the right. Romney said he was more conservative than Trump on immigration.		"My view was these DACA kids shouldn't all be allowed to stay in the country legally"		https://t.co/9W7psawumw
12. Then Romney decided to run for Senate again, and changed his tune. He happily accepted Trump's endorsement, stressed his connections and relationship with the president and their agreement on core policy issues https://t.co/9W7psawumw
11. After Romney was passed over, he resumed his criticism of Trump, blasting his comments about the white supremacist march in Charlottesville and accusing him of "unraveling...our national fabric" https://t.co/9W7psawumw
10. Following the second meeting, Romney showered Trump with praise: "[H]e continues with a message of inclusion and bringing people together, and his vision is something which obviously connected with the American people in a very powerful way." https://t.co/9W7psawumw
9. After Trump won, Romney immediately reversed course and began lobbying to be Trump's Secretary of State. He met Trump at his New Jersey golf course and then again at "Jean-Georges, a three-star Michelin restaurant" at the Trump hotel in NYC https://t.co/9W7psawumw
8. In March 2016, in a last ditch effort to deny Trump the nomination, Romney delivered a blistering speech saying Trump had "neither the temperament nor the judgment to be president," would lead America into a recession and put the country in danger. https://t.co/9W7psawumw
7. A few years later, in 2015, Romney blasted Trump as "hurtful" and "childish" and obliquely blamed him for his 2012 loss -- as if Trump magically became an important part of Romney's campaign https://t.co/9W7psawumw https://t.co/PW41hiPXaI
6. In an August 2012 appearance in Michigan, Romney told his own birther "joke": "No one‚Äôs ever asked to see my birth certificate. They know that this is the place where both of us were born and raised."https://t.co/9W7psawumw
5. Asked about Trump's role in the campaign while pushing the birther conspiracy, Romney said: "I need to get 50.1 percent or more and I'm appreciative to have the help of a lot of good people" https://t.co/9W7psawumw
4. In May 2012, days after Trump gave an interview to the Daily Beast claiming Obama was born in Kenya, Romney featured him in a fundraising solicitation. People who donated got a chance to stay at Trump's hotel "Dine with The Donald"		https://t.co/9W7psawumw https://t.co/NtWHrlB8q5
3. "Being in Donald Trump's magnificent hotel and having his endorsement is a delight," Romney said, "I'm so honored and pleased to have his endorsement. ... Donald Trump has shown an extraordinary ability to understand how our economy works." https://t.co/9W7psawumw
2. In 2012, as Trump pushed his racist birther conspiracy, Romney solicited his endorsement. 		He went to Trump Tower to "discuss campaign strategy." Then he trekked to Las Vegas to accept Trump's endorsement.		https://t.co/9W7psawumw

@JudyinJP @MeghnaWBUR I'm not supporting any particular Democratic candidate at the moment. If you believe it proves she's racist, that would obviously be disqualifying, but I think there are other reasonable interpretations.
5. I think a vigorous Democratic primary is a very healthy thing and no topic should be off limits. But there should not be one standard for Democrats and another for Trump.
4. So the issue of Elizabeth Warren's ancestry merits coverage, but it's one proxy issue for honesty. Even if you accept the most sinister interpretation, it's no worse than Trump's letter.		It shouldn't be mentioned in every article while dozens of Trump's issues are ignored.
3. There are so many of these proxy issues involving Trump, however, they are routinely given little coverage by the media. 		Remember when Trump dictated a letter that said his health was "extraordinary" and had his doctor sign it?		It's never mentioned anymore.
2. Many issues that arise during presidential campaigns are proxies for larger issues that provide clues for how candidates will conduct themselves in office.		This was the theory behind coverage of Hillary's emails. It was a proxy for her honesty and commitment to fair dealing.
1. The 2020 campaign is now underway and all Democratic candidates deserve scrutiny. 		But the public also deserves PERSPECTIVE.
Interesting that Trump thinks his voters will see him as ‚Äúinauthentic‚Äù unless he shuts down the government until Congress appropriates taxpayer money to fund a wall when he actually promised that the wall wouldn‚Äôt cost taxpayers anything because Mexico would pay for it https://t.co/o3Rmqm9q3M

1. WTF is going on with @DallasWoodhouse, the executive director of the North Carolina GOP? Just a few weeks ago, Woodhouse said that the evidence of election fraud was so pervasive, a new election was likely justified in the 9th District. https://t.co/O6zeK6RGuj https://t.co/NCyoc7Pn73

Presenting that vision, rather than making the case against Trump, should be the central focus of Democrats in 2020. People already know about Trump.
Real opportunity in 2020 for Democrats to authentically seize the mantle of populism. For Trump, populism means a massive corporate tax cut and a border wall. Democrats have a chance to present a compelling alternative.

@Ominabeshi it's several sentences. which one confuses you?
My own view is that corporations receive much too little scrutiny for how they spend their money -- political contributions, advertising, stock buybacks. 		Remember: The corporate form is a creation of the state, designed to benefit the public. A public discussion is healthy.
FACT: No one actually believes major corporations should be able to advertise against any kind of content without criticism.		If you think Tucker Carlson's show is in the mainstream &amp; should not be subject to criticism, that's fine.		But it's not an argument about "free speech"
@Celgene @4oceanBracelets @mitsucars @23andMe @MyPillowUSA @SandalsResorts @MassageEnvy @wearehims @Ebates @grazeusa @Toyota @Bayer @PajamaGram There are definitely fewer national advertisers willing to support Tucker Carlson.

"Harris also interacted regularly with Dowless during the 2018 primary campaign, according to Jeff Smith... Smith told The Post that Dowless spoke often of talking to Harris by telephone about the mail-in absentee-ballot program."
"Harris decided to hire Dowless before he brought on Red Dome in June 2017...And he decided to hire him despite warnings about Dowless‚Äôs criminal record and Dowless‚Äôs own public testimony describing questionable election tactics."		https://t.co/lufZhysMeh
There is more than sufficient evidence for the North Carolina Election Board to order a new election now. The board could do so before Republicans have a chance to jam through a new law just so they can swap out Harris and have a chance of retaining the seat.
But I'm not sure why the Democratic Governor of North Carolina, Roy Cooper, would assist them in their efforts by signing the bill and changing the rules of the election midstream.
This is why North Carolina Republicans are desperately trying to change the law to mandate a new primary so they can rid themselves of Harris.		But they were warned of the fraud too and ignored it. They only cared once they got caught.

@PassionateCaro2 @MJ_Adamson 10 days could give election board a chance to order a new election before this becomes law
@deenazee @RoyCooperNC True but he could also just hold it, giving the election board a chance to order a new election before this thing becomes law
@cmitchellrealty @RoyCooperNC That's exactly what happened. They tried it, it failed. They tried it again the next day and it worked.
6. Final point. North Carolina has runoffs. So if it orders a new primary. There could be a new primary, a runoff and then a general. 		The 9th District wouldn't have representation for the better part of a year.
This is an interesting thought. What did you direct Cohen to do? Did you direct him to pay off Daniels and McDougal? https://t.co/7Usscu1lGL
5. So now it's up to @RoyCooperNC will he sign this law and allow the North Carolina Republicans to wipe the slate clean and pretend this never happened. 		Or will the 2018 election be completed under a consistent set of rules.
@yodermon well technically it would apply to all times the board orders new elections
4. Keep in mind, there is only one purpose to this law. It's to get Harris off the ballot because the GOP now views him as damaged goods.		The North Carolina GOP was warned about the fraud in the primary by its sitting Congressman and ignored it.
3. The problem is that under current law, the Election Board can't order a new primary, which has already been certified. 		So the GOP legislature got to work. Yesterday, it passed a bill changing the rules. It would require the board to order a new primary and general.
@RoyCooperNC 2. This week, the North Carolina GOP realized that there was just too much evidence of election fraud in the 9th and gave up their campaign to get Harris certified. 		So they started supporting a new election. 		But now they want a new primary and general.
1. @RoyCooperNC is facing a very important decision that will have a big impact on who becomes the next member of Congress for the 9th District. 		But few people are paying attention. 		That should change.

Russians interacted with at least 14 Trump associates during the campaign and transition:		Trump Jr		Kushner		Ivanka		Michael Cohen		Felix Sater		Papadopoulos		Manafort		Carter Page		Sessions		Flynn		JD Gordon		Roger Stone		Michael Caputo		Rick Gates		https://t.co/NEeJIHQBzh
4. There's evidence that close Trump associates were coordinating w/Wikileaks and helping Russia.		This was good for Trump's campaign but even if he lost, it could have earned Trump A LOT of cash in return. 		More tomorrow in my newsletter. Sign up at https://t.co/Gl6evXRDcZ
3. So if you are looking for what motivated Trump before and after the election to go to extreme lengths to defend Putin the answer could be simple: MONEY		Also the fact that Trump denied he had business ties with Russia when he did. Putin knew it and, therefore, it was leverage
The reason this is important is that it's EXPONENTIALLY more than other recent Trump deals. Here's how much Trump made on other recent deals:		Toronto ($1M)		Vancouver ($5M)		Azerbaijan ($2.5M)		Georgia ($1M)		As @joshTPM noted, the Moscow Project would be a HUGE deal for Trump
1. An very important detail buried in Mueller's sentencing memo for Michael Cohen. 		The potential deal for a Trump tower in Moscow would be worth HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS to Trump. 		Mueller would not put this in the memo if he couldn't prove it. https://t.co/wihydkBvyT
5. But as far as the kind of evidence you'd expect to justify impeachment, we are already well past the line. My guess is Dems want to wait to see what else Mueller has. But he really doesn't need anything else.
4. So if we are going with no indicting a sitting president, a formal determination by the DOJ is the best that you are going to do.		Again, I understand the Senate would be unlikely to convict and it might be politically better for the Dems to talk about health care
3. The thinking behind that "rule" is that impeachment, not a criminal trial, the the proper avenue to address criminal conduct by a POTUS. 		If you accept that, you can't also say there is no evidence of criminal conduct because the president hasn't been convicted
2. I say this because I don't think anyone would seriously argue that committing a felony is not a "high crime or misdemeanor"		I understand that the DOJ hasn't proven their allegations but the conventional wisdom is that the POTUS can't be indicted
1. The Justice Department has said in court documents that the President of the United States committed two felonies to help him win the 2016 election		There are some political reasons not to impeach Trump but there are really no substantive reasons anymore
Agreed. Who can even remember if it's legal or not to pay off an alleged mistress days before the campaign and then cover it up? It's so complicated! https://t.co/WiDpEIxZ3l

3. Red Dome Group is the consulting firm that the Harris campaign used to hire Leslie McCrae Dowless, the convicted felon at the center of the scandal. 		The amount of money it was paying to his operation undercuts the idea that they didn't know anything suspect was going on.
2.

Great BuzzFeed article with more information on McCrae Dowless‚Äô vote harvesting operation in North Carolina‚Äôs 9th district 		One detail stood out to me... https://t.co/BZ4yZ3rCUR
A lot of the details in this story come from a great New Yorker article that came out a couple hours ago so, I also recommend reading that: https://t.co/rIr1JPwlwa
11. Smith was clearly desperate to oust McVicker. But he's not as good at rigging absentee ballots as McCrae Dowless. 		McVicker defeated his opponent and is still sheriff. 		Where is goes from here -- I have no idea.
10. So today, one day after Smith dimed out McCrae Dowless to the Washington Post, these notes, written by Smith, make their way into the hands of a North Carolina reporter		And they show Smith cooking up a scheme to pay CASH for UNSEALED ABSENTEE BALLOTS https://t.co/lNSfk7ZLzT
9. The story on Smith involves a meeting that occurred during the 2018 primary. Smith was supporting Billy Ward in the GOP Primary to oust McVicker.		At this point, he's not working WITH McCrae Dowless, he's on his own now		At some point he attended a meeting &amp; left behind NOTES
8. Smith basically describes a whole bunch of illegal conduct by McCrae Dowless in fairly devastating fashion 		Well, someone (I don't know who, but maybe McCrae Dowless) wasn't happy about that		Today, an even more devastating story emerged on Smith
7. This is apparently when Smith and McCrae Dowless become "former friends." So when the current controversy erupts, Smith is more than happy to dime out McCrae Dowless to the Washington Post. 		Shows them the desk where Dowless sat and recieved the absentee ballots from his crew
6. OK, I'm back. So anyway everything is going swimmingly between McCrae Dowless and Smith until Smith finds out that McCrae Dowless isn't just running his (probably illegal) absentee ballot operation for Harris -- he's also helping Smith's arch nemesis McVicker!
standby have to take a phone call
5. But apparently Smith does not blame McCrae Dowless, who, after all, did what he what he was supposed to do (If you overlook breaking N Carolina law)		Smith agrees to let McCrae Dowless use an empty office in a building Smith owns to run his absentee ballot operation for Harris
4. But Smith gets stabbed in the back. McVicker raids his video-sweepstakes operation BACKED UP BY HELICOPTERS. Smith is pissed.
@Velcroski Yes
3. But Bordeaux says, there's an out. If Jim McVicker wins the 2014 election for sheriff, Smith will be in the clear. 		Bordeaux asks Smith to give McCrae Dowless $4000 IN CASH to help McVicker win. So Smith does it. 		And it works. McVicker wins by 350 votes!
2. So Jeff Smith owns a "video sweepstakes" business in Bladen County, which is apparently a place you an go and win money for playing video games. 		The head of the Bladen County GOP, Landon Bordeaux, goes to Smith and says that he's about to get raided by the current sheriff.

Dowless paid Kinlaw $100 to pick up ballots, which is not enough to convince people to cover up a criminal conspiracy when things go south
Kinlaw also says that Dowless instructed to pressure people to vote for Harris when they were filling out their ballot. She says she didn't follow this instruction. But if others did, that is also a big problem.

4. Will the North Carolina State Board of Election order a new election?		It has the power to do so under state law. 		It is not a requirement that the disputed votes be numerous enough to sway the election, although that bar will be easily met.
3. How far did Dowless' operation reach?		We know that Dowless boasted to a friend that he wanted to expand to neighboring counties. The returns in neighboring Robeson county, in some respects, are even more suspect.		Was Dowless involved?
2. What did Dowless do with or to the ballots after he received them? 		Taking possession of ballots in is illegal. But Dowless got his hands on HUNDREDS.		And we know that while Republicans only requested 19% of the ballots in Bladen, Harris won 61% of the absentee vote.
1. What did Mark Harris, the Republican candidate, know about the activities of Leslie McCrae Dowless, the convicted felon at the center of the scandal.		Harris knew Dowless and recommended him to other candidates. 		How much did Harris know about his scheme?
Yesterday, the North Carolina election scandal exploded. 		This is a thread of the key unanswered questions.		If you need to catch up on the story, read this: https://t.co/mRSi48AO5o

- Trump's oldest political adviser was getting advance information about Wikileaks' plans from intermediaries 		- Trump was actively pursuing development projects in Russia at least until June 2016
- Trump Jr. then set up a meeting between all the top brass on the Trump campaign and numerous Russians 		- One of Trump's foreign policy advisers was told of the hacked emails in advance and bragged about it to an Australian diplomat
2. Since then we've learned		- There were numerous contacts between the Trump campaign and Russian officials throughout 2016		- An intermediary told Trump Jr. the Russian gov't had dirt on Hillary and Trump Jr. said he wanted it

6. He recently wrote a book about his experiences. I listened to several media interviews and he really offers no explanation for his KKK activities (other than he was young) and appears to have made no effort to make amends  https://t.co/fM48z4S6Hv
5. Malvaney drew public attention because he had been given a high-profile role in the BP oil spill clean up. His reaction to the story wasn't exactly contrite.		"I have an unblemished record. My work speaks for itself. My reputation speaks for itself" 		https://t.co/fM48z4S6Hv

3. After the Navy, Malvaney participated in a white supremacist plot to overthrow the Caribbean island of Dominica. He was arrested w/8 automatic rifles, 10 shotguns, five rifles, 10 handguns, 10 lbs of dynamite, 5,246 rounds of ammunition, and a Nazi flag https://t.co/fM48z4S6Hv
2. First Malvaney wasn't just a member of the KKK, he was an organizer. He recruited for a Klavern while aboard a U.S. Navy ship. and organize a Klan rally in Virginia. Eventually, that got him kicked out. (Somehow, he received an "honorable discharge.") https://t.co/fM48z4S6Hv

After watching the debate in Mississippi, I have no idea what's going to happen on Tuesday.		But 5 major corporations - Walmart, AT&amp;T, Union Pacific, Leidos &amp; Boston Scientific - have rejected Hyde-Smith's racist comments and asked for their money back. 		That's something.
BOOM 		Espy mentions Walmart asking for a refund in his closing statement. 		Notes the company says that Hyde-Smith does not reflect its values and says she doesn't represent Mississippi's values.		He also brings up the voter suppression comments.
Hyde-Smith's comments on voter suppression were not even mentioned.
Hyde-Smith uses her closing statement to promote her rallies with Trump again. This has been an awful debate overall.
Espy's question to Hyde-Smith is whether she knew when she voted for short-term insurance plans, those plans can exclude preexisting conditions. 		Hyde-Smith says it was part of a "plan" &amp; she has never voted for a bill that only eliminated protections for preexisiting conditions
Hyde-Smith hits Espy two times for a discrimination complaint filed against the Department of Agriculture related to something that happened in 1992. 		Espy points out he wasn't even Secretary of Agriculture until 1993.		Just a brutally dishonest attack by Hyde-Smith
Espy notes that the bill Hyde-Smith supports to protect people with preexisting conditions doesn't actually require insurance companies to cover TREATMENT for preexisting conditions. 		Hyde-Smith ignores that point. Says no one will fight harder for people.
Hyde-Smith says that Espy was in Congress "a century ago" (?) and wants "health care for illegal immigrants."
Missed Hyde-Smith's opening statement: "The night before the election, the President of the United States is coming to Mississippi on my behalf...I encourage you to go online at https://t.co/Kvd0OBJhtH and get those tickets."
Hyde-Smith quickly pivots off criminal justice reform to BUILD THE WALL.
Hyde-Smith, asked about criminal justice reform: "I support law enforcement. I don‚Äôt support criminals"
The debate is being hosted by supporters of Hyde-Smith. The guiding principle seems to be to make no news. Panelists ask very general questions with no follow ups.
Hyde-Smith seems be to be speaking extensively from notes. She insisted that she be provided with a notepad an hour before the debate began and it appears someone has loaded it up with talking points.
"There is never been anything, not one thing in my background that has ever indicated I have ill will toward anyone," says Hyde-Smith, who was photographed in Confederate battle garb with a member of a hate group
Hyde-Smith says her comments on "public hangings" were "twisted" by her opponent. 		Apologizes to "anyone who was offended," while suggesting that no one had any reason to be offended.

5. Without those policies there would be a surplus. 		So the idea that Democrats would self-impose fiscal austerity NOW makes little sense. 		More in my newsletter, Popular Information.		Subscribe at https://t.co/Gl6evXRDcZ
4. The entire deficit this year can be explained by GOP policies passed since 2000.		Bush tax cuts ($488 billion), Trump cuts ($164 billion), wars in Afghanistan &amp; Iraq ($127 billion), and defense spending increases above Clinton-era levels ($156 billion) https://t.co/KflNO4Cpsi
3. Pelosi has said she will reinstate it but that position would make it close to impossible to pass any bold legislation through the House. 		It would create an asymmetry where Republicans pass whatever they want and Dems commit themselves to austerity. 		https://t.co/KflNO4Cpsi
2. Pay-go is a rule that anything that increases the deficit must be offset by spending cuts or tax increases. 		The Democrats have followed it much of the time.		Republicans routinely ignore it. They passed trillions in tax cuts and just waived it. 		https://t.co/KflNO4Cpsi
1. There is a lot of buzz over the jockeying to be the next speaker. Hard to see where this is going - she has no opponent.		But as Pelosi cobbles together  votes there is an opportunity to extract policy concessions.		The first should be pay-go.		https://t.co/KflNO4U0jQ

4. Google is now aware of the comments and says it would not donate to a candidate that jokes about attending a lynching. 		But the company is not asking for its money back.		So I'm not sure what principle is guiding the company 		https://t.co/MBj2LJGzy0
3. What's the truth? I'm not sure. Google would only tell me their check to Hyde-Smith was dated November 2. The company wouldn't say when they sent it or when Hyde-Smith received it.		In a basic sense the timeline does not matter all the much now.		https://t.co/MBj2LJGzy0
@Google 2. Google's point is that they made the contribution before Hyde-Smith's lynching comments were public. The company says had they known they wouldn't have done it. 		But that also suggests Hyde-Smith filed a false report with the FEC		https://t.co/MBj2LJGzy0
1. Some updates on @Google and their $5000 contribution to Mississippi Senator Cindy-Hyde Smith.		Hyde-Smith reported to the FEC that she received the contribution on November 13.		Google says they made the contribution on November 2		https://t.co/s6JZBAm2kD

3. Google now says they made the contribution on NOVEMBER 2, 2018. If accurate, this would mean that Hyde-Smith filed a false report with the FEC and failed to report a contribution of over $1000 within 48 hours. https://t.co/OcoZyV0EgH

3. This isn't to say that it isn't worth pursuing just on principle. But politically, it helps Trump and there is no real practical upside for Acosta or the media.
2. If CNN is successful, maybe Acosta gets back into the White House. But that doesn't mean they are going to answer any of his questions -- or even call on him.		Fundamentally, showing up at the White House is an access game that requires cooperation.
For those asking why I think this:		1. Trump thrives on pitting himself against the media. CNN does not actually oppose Trump. They hire Trump acolytes to push his talking points. But this bolsters his preferred frame.
Whatever the legal merits, being sued by CNN is a gift to Trump

Yesterday Trump fired Sessions, yanked Rosenstein off the Russia investigation and installed a political partisan hostile to Mueller in his place		The people with the power to hold Trump in check did... nothing		This is how the rule of law dies		https://t.co/OXiqqGFSYL
Important: We have no idea what Whitaker might have ALREADY DONE to stifle the Mueller investigation 		This process is completely opaque.		But there was an enormous rush to install Whitaker yesterday.		Why?
@Susan_Hennessey @guypbenson Seems like the fact that Sessions was fired specifically because he did not shut down the Mueller investigation is relevant context. Not sure a technical parsing of conflicts rules captures the whole picture
@MarkHarrisNYC I take your point and generally stay away from this argument but I think the WH knows there is value in manufacturing a controversy to compete with what‚Äôs going on with Sessions/Whitaker/Mueller
9. The only real unknown is what Mueller will do. He had to know this was coming and presumably has a plan.
8. The general posture of the coverage now seems to be: let‚Äôs wait and see what happens. What will Whitaker do? But it‚Äôs obvious why he‚Äôs there. There is nothing to wait for. Now is the time for action. But the response is muted, at best.
7. At the same time, Trump is creating various distractions to blur the focus of the public and the media. Revoking a reporter‚Äôs press pass is perfect. It plays into the media‚Äôs self-importance. An impossible story to resist.
5. Trump is panicking about something happening, imminently. This is the nuclear option for the Mueller investigation.		6. He‚Äôs betting Republicans will do nothing in response. So far it looks like a good bet. A handful of Republican Senators (3) have issued some mild tweets
3. Sessions was not allowed to even finish the week. He was forced out immediately.		4. Whitaker is a public critic of Mueller who has laid out exactly how he would derail the investigation.
There is little ambiguity about what‚Äôs going on:		1. Whitaker was plucked from obscurity to replace Sessions over his Senate-confirmed deputy (Rosenstein) and everyone else in the line of secession.		2. Rosenstein was removed immediate from the Russia investigation

4. Ross was prodded by Steve Bannon and Kris Kobach, two anti-immigrant extremists and rabid partisans. 		This is, without a doubt, a scheme to weaponize the 2020 Census for political purposes 		https://t.co/RyVzxmjZS8
3. Commerce Secretary Wilber Ross initially claimed he only added the question because the DOJ asked him to in order to enforce the Voting Rights Act. 		He was later forced to admit he badgered the DOJ to make the request so he could justify the question 		https://t.co/RyVzxmjZS8
2. The GOP plan is simple. Ask everyone if they are a U.S. citizen. 		This will depress minority participation, meaning that Republicans will get more representation than they should. 		How do we know this will happen? The Census Bureau's own research 		https://t.co/RyVzxmjZS8
1. No matter what happens today, Trump, and Trumpism, will not be defeated in one election. Or 2. 		That's why the court case that started yesterday is so important. 		Republicans are trying to manipulate a decade of elections by rigging the 2020 census		https://t.co/RyVzxmjZS8

The response to this critique is usually: ‚ÄúThere are some good reporters at Fox News.‚Äù		True. But Fox makes ZERO effort to distinguish them from Hannity‚Äôs rants. Hannity begins many of his broadcasts with ‚ÄúBreaking News‚Äù		These reporters are there to add a patina of legitimacy
Fox News was selected to moderate one of three presidential debates in 2016!		I understand Wallace asks decent questions but the result is to further legitimize Hannity, Pirro and others

Also love to get lectures on "due process" from people who endorsed an FBI investigation whose scope was determined by Kavanaugh's good friend Don McGahn and which ignored 95% of all witnesses including Ford and Kavanaugh
Remember, Ford came forward before Kavanaugh released his calendar. 		If the story was fabricated, what are the odds of Ford describing the party where and when the assault occurred and that exact kind of party, with the same people, appears on her calendar?
Also, please stop saying you found Ford‚Äôs testimony credible but she was mixed up. She said she was 100% sure Kavanaugh sexually assaulted her. If you reject that, you didn‚Äôt find her credible. 		You have to own that.
The idea that there is no corroborating evidence for Ford‚Äôs claim is a lie.		Kavanaugh‚Äôs own calendar, example, is powerful corroborating evidence.		It indicates Kavanaugh attended the exact kind of event Ford described, when she said it happened, w/the people she said were there

Big winner in all this is Ed Whelan, whose crackpot doppelganger theory somehow convinced the two deciding Senators, Manchin and Collins

After parsing Ford‚Äôs testimony to paint her as a likely liar, Collins pivots to a lecture of why it‚Äôs important to ‚Äúbelieve survivors‚Äù
Collins adopts the Ed Whalen theory, says she believes she was sexually assaulted that night ‚Äúor some other time‚Äù but probably by someone else
She‚Äôs now saying Julie Swetnick‚Äôs allegation, which the FBI wasn‚Äôt allowed to investigate, is ‚Äúoutlandish.‚Äù		Basically the argument here is he MIGHT have sexually assaulted a woman but he‚Äôs definitely not a gang rapist so therefore he has my vote.
Now she‚Äôs citing the ABA‚Äôs recommendation. She doesn‚Äôt mentioned that they just reopened it. 		This is the worst possible justification for Kavanaugh. 		It‚Äôs all fantasy.
Lol. Now she‚Äôs saying Kavanaugh will be just like Souter. 		I‚Äôll have what she‚Äôs having.
I love how impressed Collins is by Kavanaugh‚Äôs assertion that he will ‚Äúrespect prevent,‚Äù which is meaningless boilerplate every judicial nominee says
Tune in now as Senator Collins explains why Kavanaugh is a progressive champion who will protect the ACA and abortion rights, among other things.
I think we will basically know if Kavanaugh will be confirmed at 3PM, when Collins speaks. 		If she announces she is supporting Kavanaugh, that's pretty much it. 		If she announces she is opposing Kavanaugh, I don't really see Manchin defecting to put Kavanaugh over the top.

One caveat: The WSJ's sources are "GOP aides." These are the same people who have been relentlessly pushing a momentum narrative on Kavanaugh since this whole thing started
It will be up to Flake, Collins, Murkowski and any other Senators still making up their mind if they wanted a real investigation of these claims or if just the appearance of an FBI investigation will do.
According to one of Kavanaugh's accusers, Debbie Ramirez, she gave FBI agents the names of 20 people who could potentially corroborate her story. 		As of now, it does not appear the FBI has reached out to any of them.
The WSJ reports that the FBI is expected to wrap up it's investigation of Kavanaugh today or tomorrow. 		Here is a baseline: Any investigation that did not include interviews of Ford or Kavanaugh, not to mention other relevant witnesses, is a sham.
McConnell does not yet have the votes to confirm Kavanaugh but is trying to leave the impression that he does to create a sense of inevitability. 		Don't fall for it. 		https://t.co/vgWNk3yGQL https://t.co/W0aC5LN6OU

@charlescwcooke @KatMcKinley He does not say he heard about her calling around IN ADVANCE, which is exactly what is at issue. When asked if he had advanced knowledge of any kind he says "No." This is basic reading comprehension.
@guypbenson @charlescwcooke The key line is when he is asked explicitly and he says he did not have any advanced knowledge. There is no getting around it. The September 25 testimony does not do him any favors. You are reading something into a different section that is not there. We don't have to guess.
@HashtagGriswold @emptywheel He does not say in the quote you highlight that he has advanced knowledge. This is basic reading comprehension. When asked directly, he says "No." It all very explicit.
@guypbenson @charlescwcooke Guy, this is wrong. He does not say he heard about her calling around BEFORE publication. He is asked explicitly if he heard anything at all before publication and says NO. https://t.co/oiuyYHm7S9

That's because the September 25th testimony does not contradict the article. Not even a little bit. In fact, he's asked explicitly if he ever heard anything about the allegations before the publication of the New Yorker article and says "No." Couldn't be more clear. https://t.co/oo75SAhzS1
@HashtagGriswold @emptywheel That quote doesn't say that. And there is no need to infer it from his testimony. He's asked directly in the same interview.

@charlescwcooke How does that transcript in any way contradict the claims being made? It says that Kavanaugh was contacting people. That doesn't preclude that Ramirez was contacting people as well. Seems obvious she would do so.
In any other administration, lying to the public about your role in paying $130,000 in hush money to an alleged mistress would be an all-consuming, debilitating scandal

Beware of "sources" that claim to know how Murkowski, Collins and others are going to vote. They can easily make their intentions known publicly. But until they vote, anything can happen.		Among the possibilities is them voting for Kavanaugh. But there are other possibilities.
McConnell is desperate to create a momentum narrative. So desperate he released a statement announcing his own "decision" to vote for Kavanaugh.		The reason is that what happens now could have an impact on the votes of key Senators.		He's is trying to discourage the opposition.
Look, Kavanaugh could get confirmed. 		But there is no evidence of "momentum" following the hearing. Kavanaugh's performance was designed to please Trump and he liked it. That doesn't mean anything. 		Murkowski, Collins, Flake and others have not announced their vote.

This argument that teenagers only party on weekends during the summer is insane
I think the first question Kavanaugh should be asked is what evidence he has for his claim that Ford came forward as part of a plot to obtain "revenge on behalf of the Clintons."
How many Americans are watching this and say: This is just the sort of person that should be on the Supreme Court of the United States for the rest of his life
Brett Kavanaugh is losing it. Just said Ford's allegations are "revenge on behalf of the Clintons"
He doesn't seem super confident that he will be confirmed.

Republicans, except for Grassley, are remaining mute throughout Ford's testimony.		So Senator Blumenthal quotes from Lindsey Graham's own book, to devastating effect. https://t.co/qfC0Oz9N2f
This is a key point that has been overlooked. Ford tried to tell her story BEFORE Kavanaugh was selected. She isn't trying to tank his nomination at the last minute as part of a Democratic plot. She was hoping people would know about this prior to his being selected.
In an embarrassing line of questioning, the prosecutor hired by Republicans tries to show that Ford is a liar by saying she is afraid of flying but has, on occasion, flown on an airplane
I like how there are strict rules, except for Grassley, who can launch into an angry rant whenever he wants
This was an amazing moment. https://t.co/CDi1ytCz3V

Key point https://t.co/J802jpvzM9
Lindsey Graham has spent two weeks on TV questioning Ford‚Äôs credibility but is too cowardly to do it to her face

Leahy: "Chairman, you and I were both here 27 years ago. At that time, the senate failed Anita Hill. I said I believed her. But I'm concerned that we're doing a lot less for these three women today. That's my personal view"
This is demonstrating how ridiculous the 5 minute limit is. You can't conduct any serious questioning of a witness.
"I have been accused of acting out of partisan political motives. Those who say that do not know me. I am an independent person, and I am no one's pawn." -- Christine Ford		Wow.

Grassley chastises Feinstein for even MENTIONING the other allegations against Kavanaugh. 		"I'm sorry you brought up the unsubstantiated allegations of other people because we're here to listen to Dr Ford"
Contra Grassley, Deborah Ramirez and Julie Swetnick are not stonewalling. They have both asked to testify under oath before the committee.
Feinstein: "60% of sexual assaults go unreported. In addition, when survivors do report their assaults, it's often years later, due to the trauma they suffered and fearing their stories will not be believed."
Grassley is now summarily dismissing the allegations of Deborah Ramirez and Julie Swetnick. 		He accuses their attorney's of "stonewalling." 		So much for civility.
If Grassley was concerned about civility maybe he should allow Ford to speak before blasting the process in which Ford came forward and engaging in an extensive defense of Kavanaugh's sterling character
Grassley references Mark Judge, who he is refusing to call as a witness.

So Trump claims that the 14 women are not believable because they were paid. 		The reality is there is only a report that one of them got a small amount of money.  And she filed a complaint against Trump years prior.

@lknobel Thank you lance
Each Senator on the Judiciary Committee will be allotted 5 minutes to question Kavanaugh. 		That's 100 seconds for each allegation of sexual assault -- for questions and answers. 		That's less time than it takes to appropriately brush your teeth.
Trump has called a press conference this afternoon to personally defend Kavanaugh against allegations of sexual assault		The first question he should be asked is how he is in any position to do so, considering 14 women have accused him of sexual assault
Classic Flake. Tries to cast himself as a principled arbiter of truth but completely ignores the fact that there are two other allegations in addition. Doesn't mention Ramirez or Swetnick.		How can you argue that Ford deserves full consideration and humanity but not other women?
14 women have publicly accused Trump of sexual assault and you still play golf with him. https://t.co/8gl2hlUOWQ
It's important to remember that the behavior that Swetnick describes, as it relates to Mark Judge, is corroborated by Mark Judge's ex-girlfriend, who says Judge admitted to her that he took turns with other guys having sex with a drunk girl
What accusation did Avenatti make about Trump that wasn't true? https://t.co/2nRjYYOmkA

Important context of exactly what Swetnick is risking by submitting this affidavit if it isn't all true https://t.co/Q9kNGBwEXj
It was true before but, in light of Swetnick's affidavit, any process that does not include the questioning of Mark Judge is a total sham
Critically, Swetnick says she is aware of other witnesses who can corroborate her claims.
It seems like an FBI investigation of all of this is more than warranted. It also may explain why Kavanaugh and the Republicans are so adamant that no FBI investigation is necessary.
Swetnick's claim that Judge and others took turns sexually assaulting drunk girls matches the claims of another woman, Elizabeth Rasor, who spoke to the New Yorker https://t.co/CAbrpPGWnL https://t.co/c4MCymjTyw
Third woman, Julie Swetnick, submits sworn affidavit to judiciary committee alleging sexual misconduct by Kavanaugh. Says she observed Kavanaugh committing sexual assault. Also alleges she was gang-raped at a house party where Kavanaugh was present. https://t.co/0jSQRWiVNt
I'm unclear why Ramirez would not be allowed to do so. https://t.co/27b0n6BG2q
A week ago, Trump said he wanted to hear from Ford and the committee should take all the time they need to do.		I guess that was a lie.		"I really would want to see what she has to say. But I want to give it all the time they need." https://t.co/QvyQutf1FT

Democrats have 5 minutes each to question Kavanaugh. 		In my view, they should all yield their time to Kamala Harris and Amy Klobuchar. 		They are the ones with experience questioning witnesses. By pooling their time, they will actually be able to do a real cross-examination.

5. The last declaration is from her husband who says she told him about the assault in general terms when they were married in 2002 and then in detail during a therapy session in 2012. This declaration is bolstered by the therapists notes
4. In 2017, she told a third friend: "[S]he told me she had read a recent social media post I had written about my own [] sexual assault... She then told me that when she was a young teen, she had been sexually assaulted... her assailant was now a federal judge."
3. In 2016, she told another friend: "Christine expressed anger at [Brock] Turner‚Äôs lenient sentence, stating that she was particularly bothered by it because she was assaulted in high school by a man who was now a federal judge in Washington, D.C."
2. In 2013, she told a friend about the alleged assault: "Christine told me she had been having a hard day because she was thinking about an assault she experienced when she was much younger. She said she had been almost raped by someone who was now a federal judge. "

In the Thomas/Hill hearings, the three key Republicans and three key Democrats were each given 30 minutes to ask questions. Other Senators were given 5 minutes each.
THOMAS/HILL HEARINGS: 440 minutes allocated for questioning of Thomas and Hill. 		22 other witnesses. 		FBI investigation.		KAVANAUGH/FORD HEARINGS: 210 minutes allocated for the questioning of Kavanaugh and Ford. 		Zero other witnesses. 		No FBI investigation.
The treatment of these women is outrageous. 		If you don't believe them, just say you don't believe them. 		But inventing a ridiculous conspiracy theory out of thin air in an effort to ascribe malevolent motives is shameful.
The facts are that two women, completely on their on volition, have come forward with serious allegations of sexual assault against Kavanaugh		The idea that they have invented these claims as part of a partisan plot is an ugly smear
It's easy to lose sight of them but Kavanaugh, Trump, McConnell and virtually every Republican Senator describe the sexual assault allegations against Kavanaugh as a Democratic plot		THERE IS NOT A SINGLE SCRAP OF EVIDENCE TO SUPPORT THIS CLAIM

4. When the NYT reported Kavanaugh &amp; his football teammates referenced the "Renate Alumni" on their yearbook pages, Kavanaugh said it was a reference to a "kiss" w/a girl from a nearby school		It's implausible, but the woman also says she never kissed him		https://t.co/1uz49MNWMn

2. In a letter to the Senate Judiciary Committee yesterday, Kavanaugh claimed the two women accusing him of sexual assault were coordinating with each other. 		This is an outlandish claim and he offered no evidence to support it 		https://t.co/1uz49MNWMn

I didn't have any special insight into Kavanaugh's prospects or knowledge about the sexual assault allegations of. 		But I've observed politics long enough to know that it is unpredictable. 		Pretending confirmation is inevitable is a political tactic to depress the opposition.

1. The push to force Ford to testify as quickly as possible is a tactic straight from the Republican's Anita Hill playbook. 		The purpose is to maximize the power differential between Ford and Kavanaugh. 		https://t.co/thKIzsIVx3 https://t.co/dOoghiTRM9
Does anyone have a plausible theory about why Ford would:		1. Make up a story about being sexually assaulted by Kavanaugh 		2. Include in her false story a witness who could contradict her account		3. Request an FBI investigation of her lie, when lying to the FBI is a felony
(Whispers) It‚Äôs definitely impossible if you don‚Äôt investigate at all 		And the issue is not whether you ‚Äúprove‚Äù anything ‚Äî it‚Äôs whether you take things seriously enough to gather all relevant facts https://t.co/DycxExgXmy
In this way, Republicans are treating Ford less fairly than Hill.		But they are also following their playbook for Hill, practically to the letter, to neutralize and discredit Ford.		I‚Äôll have all the details in my newsletter tomorrow morning 		Sign up at https://t.co/Gl6evXRDcZ

Republicans need two of those three (Collins, Murkowski and Flake) to confirm Kavanaugh. 		They hold the cards, not Graham or McConnell
Lots of noise today. Grassley says they are moving forward no matter what. But here is what matters:		1. Ford has not said explicitly that she won't testify Mon		2. Collins, Murkowski and Flake have not said explicitly that they will vote for Kavanaugh w/o hearing from Ford
@PatrickRuffini One of the great things about being older is the background music in supermarkets and stuff is my jam
The Anita Hill hearings were a travesty but even then there was an FBI investigation and 22 witnesses over 3 days		For Ford, Republicans want no investigation, no witnesses except Ford and Kavanaugh, 1 day		Somehow it‚Äôs 27 years later and we are taking allegations less seriously
The President of the United States, who 14 women have accused of sexual assault, is blocking an FBI investigation into his nominee to the Supreme Court, who also is accused of sexual assault.		The President says all 15 women are lying.

4. If Kavanaugh acknowledges drinking until he passed out or blacked out, how can he credibly deny Ford's story? 		His friend Mark Judge should be called to testify about their behavior as well. 		It should all be under oath		https://t.co/v5ivVBwS0V

@samiamsamh I think that's true and he's also not saying it was a mistake. he's saying it didn't happen.
@Snowhawk04 I absolutely think they would try to push another nominee through in the lame duck. Smart money is on Amy Coney Barrett
@AngryFedupVtr I'm not sure. Republicans are very committed to him being confirmed. Prior to this my view was that he was likely to be confirmed but it's not a sure thing until he gets the votes. I continue to believe that and now it will be more difficult for him to get the votes
@AnnaKeesey That's possible although Kavanaugh isn't saying he doesn't remember. He's saying it never happened.
@RohitPuskoor Yes, we've already seen Republicans begin to attack her character and its likely to get worse.
@OMETA16 Interesting thought but the victim, at this point, chose to go public and its a lifetime appointment impacting everyone so I'd prefer a public hearing.
@Catbe1 I think the lie detector test is the weakest evidence in her favor. In my view the therapist's notes are critical. We've already seen them try to discredit her as part of a Democratic plot.
@Kierceldwen It's true that we really don't know much about these 65 women other than they signed their name to a letter.
@Shaere10 Generally, in these situations there is more than one victim. But we just don't know.
@zakgarcia I don't think you can assume that asking for a delay mean they will vote no. They could ask for a delay, get it, and vote yes. 		To push it past the midterms, you'd need to get past election day. Simple as that.
@krubin They are sticking with their story that they put it together after the allegations leaked. BuzzFeed has an interesting story about it: https://t.co/tRxetci1fP
@seerlophane Their margins are so small that it's hard to go forward this way. If Flake, for example, votes no in committee he'd presumably vote no on the floor. That means they could lose only one more senator.
@MaBell43650307 Not really but you did have Flake and Corker say the votes shouldn't go forward until the Senate hears from Ford. So that is at least a start and something we haven't seen before.

4. Facebook &amp; Poynter have created an alternate reality where there is a Weekly Standard fact check unit that exists separately from the rest of the org		But it's really just one guy		Does he operate completely independently? Does he have an editor?		https://t.co/BNPHZ8sY0I
3. It then struck a deal with Facebook to join their program prior to conducting a single legitimate fact check		This is a play for the right-wing to gain power and it worked. 		Now we are watching how they wield this power		https://t.co/BNPHZ8sY0I
2. Prior to Facebook's program granting certain fact-checkers the ability to effective censor articles, The Weekly Standard had no fact checking program and derided the  activity as pointless and counter-productive 		https://t.co/BNPHZ8sY0I

8. So on the strength of a handful of fact checks that an independent expert deemed insufficient, The Weekly Standard now has the ability to effectively censor any piece of content on the Facebook platform 		https://t.co/BNPHZ8sY0I

6. I spoke w/Mark Coddington, a journalism professor who Poynter had review TWS's application. 		He told me he thought there really wasn't enough of a track record to make a full evaluation		He advised Poynter wait 3 months before deciding to certify them		https://t.co/BNPHZ8sY0I
5. But in order for Facebook to select them, the Weekly Standard need to get approved by Poynter. So they started checking facts on November 1 and after a grand total of 10 fact checks submitted their application 		https://t.co/BNPHZ8sY0I

@Mantzarlis In November, the independent evaluator recommended at least three more months before approval. 		You approved on December 6. 		I assume you will stop responding at this point because there is no answer to this
@Mantzarlis It says right there: "Still, I recommend several changes before the Fact Check is approved"		One of the recommendations was waiting several months to build up a bigger track record. That never happened.
@Mantzarlis I‚Äôll also add that TWS was announced by Facebook as a partner before they even applied or had a fact-checking section. There is no transparency into how this determination was made
@Mantzarlis I‚Äôm amazed that your analysis is that the problem is being concerned about this, rather than asserting a factual article is false. You are not a lawyer and neither is the factchecker. Nor did he consult any lawyers. It‚Äôs deeply irresponsible
@Mantzarlis Also, what is your view on the quality of the fact check? It doesn‚Äôt address the article AT ALL. It simply asserts that is is false. Because Facebook has anointed a right-wing org a factchecker a community of 2 billion people are told that accurate legal analysis is false

3. Kavanaugh said "all roads lead to the Glucksberg test as the test that the Supreme Court has settled on as the proper test" to determine whether "unenumerated rights" are legitimate		Glucksberg says such rights must be "deeply rooted in this Nation‚Äôs history and tradition"
@SenatorCollins @lisamurkowski 2. It happened during a discussion with Ted Cruz about "unenumerated rights." These are rights that aren't named explicitly in the Constitution but the Supreme Court has ruled are implicit.		This includes abortion

Judd Legum on Senator Corker: "You have actual power to provide a check on Trump. You won't use it. Your self-righteous words are meaningless." https://t.co/8yUpoLJNhe
This anonymous op-ed in the NYT reminds me that Kavanaugh just had a disastrous day in his Senate hearing and still does not have 51 votes committed and would give the right-wing an ideological stranglehold on the court for decades
I also wouldn‚Äôt dismiss the possibility that the op-ed was coordinated by Trump or his allies. 		Seems to perfectly line up with the idea that the media and disloyal internal forces are conspiring against him
@hamishmckenzie @chaykak Here is hoping you both are right
Lots more on this tomorrow in my newsletter, Popular Information. 		Sign up at https://t.co/Gl6evXRDcZ
Trump separated 2500 children from their families. (Hundreds are still apart.) What did this anonymous hero do? 		The people supporting Trump in their public lives will forever be defined by it. 		There are no secret super heroes in the White House.
Personally, I don't think the NYT should have published that op-ed anonymously. 		It grants anonymity to give someone a free license to pain themselves as heroic, when they are actually enabling Trump. 		The idea they are controlling his worst instincts is a joke.
The real question is whether or not this is having any influence on Murkowski and Collins. 		But it's important to note that neither of them have announced their support.		A day like today will not help.
This was an absolutely BRUTAL day of testimony for Kavanaugh. 		On multiple occasions he was exposed as lying or misleading the committee. 		Kavanaugh frequently appeared rattled and unprepared.		More documents showing his deception are being kept secret by the Republicans.
Brett Kavanaugh takes emails from people who say they spying on Democrats seriously but not literally https://t.co/zKzLVCCeB5
In 2006, Kavanaugh testified under oath, w/no caveats: "I was not involved and am not involved in the questions about the rules governing detention of combatants"		He was involved. 		But he refuses to admit his answer was false. 		Twists himself in knots to avoid responsibility. https://t.co/hOwQ4e8BNy
Oops.		Grassley, outraged, says they are producing the records required by law under the Presidential Records Act.		Durbin reminds him that they've actually circumvented that law and the process is being run by Kavanaugh's close friend and former employee, Bill Burck. https://t.co/s4Q7IpwElA
Lindsay Graham currently hearkening back to the good old days of Strom Thurmond. 		Seriously.
There are a few juicy quotes but, based on the excerpts, I'm not sure we learn anything new about Trump.		He does worse stuff publicly -- often on Twitter -- on a regular basis.
5. More on the Kavanaugh hearings, today and all week, in my newsletter Popular Information.		Sign up at https://t.co/Gl6evXRDcZ
4. Durbin says, this summer, Kavanaugh privately admitted to him that his testimony wasn't accurate. 		Lying to Congress is a pretty big deal..		A crime, in fact.		Surprised this isn't getting more attention. 		https://t.co/tyF8RXexuN
3. Subsequent reporting revealed that Kavanaugh had advised the Bush administration about whether the program would pass Supreme Court muster 		So his denial wasn't true 		https://t.co/tyF8RXexuN
2. In his 2006 hearing, Durbin asked him if he was involved in Bush's interrogation program, which included torture. 		Kavanaugh definitively denied it. 		https://t.co/tyF8RXexuN https://t.co/H7V6wG5boi
1. Does everyone realize that, according to Durbin, Kavanaugh privately admitted he lied under oath during his previous confirmation hearing?		It's pretty straightforward.		https://t.co/RCXZEzqVZo

Also a bizarre rant about Comey and how Trump was within his rights to fire him
Lindsay Graham spends his opening statement in the Kavanaugh hearing attacking Hillary Clinton. 		I'm not kidding.
Durbin calls out Kavanaugh for lying to him during his last confirmation hearing, in 2006. He said he wasn't involved with the policy around "enemy combatants" but he now acknowledges he was.		Documents related to his involvement are likely among those being withheld. https://t.co/SKRjQsvdmp
Wow. Bob Woodward says Trump's attorney, John Dowd, told Trump: "Don‚Äôt testify. It‚Äôs either that or an orange jumpsuit."
Trump reportedly told his staff that his second speech on Charlottesville, condemning white supremacists and neo-Nazis, was "the biggest fucking mistake I‚Äôve made"
"This guy is mentally retarded. He‚Äôs this dumb Southerner. ‚Ä¶ He couldn‚Äôt even be a one-person country lawyer down in Alabama." -- Trump on Jeff Sessions
"He‚Äôs an idiot. It‚Äôs pointless to try to convince him of anything. He‚Äôs gone off the rails. We‚Äôre in Crazytown. I don‚Äôt even know why any of us are here. This is the worst job I‚Äôve ever had.‚Äù -- White House Chief of Staff John Kelly on Trump https://t.co/x6EinVEcyd
Important point from Leahy: Trump promised to appoint Justices that would overturn Roe v. Wade
Orrin Hatch says Kavanaugh is a "normal person."
Grassley says Clarence Thomas was a victim of "character assassination." Shameful. https://t.co/jpdlReJbck
Grassley emphasizing that there is 500K documents. Tens of thousands of these documents are just duplicates of invitations to events. In the meantime, millions are being withheld. https://t.co/ZnpyiaQHx7
Grassley now complaining about the Democrats delaying the hearing: "How long is this going to go on?"		It's been 90 minutes. 		Republicans refused to even give Merrick Garland a hearing for 9 MONTHS. https://t.co/Bhyu0pwDP5
Durbin hits on the key question: Who is Bill Burck? (He's the GOP lawyer and "close friend" of Kavanaugh who is denying access to over 100K documents.) https://t.co/0fx8nxXI1K
Cornyn says that this is the first nomination hearing he's attended that was being run by "mob rule." Lol. https://t.co/1A7DwNgDl3

@JuddLegum¬†Leahy eviscerates Grassley's claims that the process is the same as it was for Kagan. For Kagan, 99% of her White House records were public 12 days before the hearing. For Kavanaugh, the hearing has started and 4% of his White House documents are public. https://t.co/J6ttQKxv8K
Blumenthal hits the key question: "What is the administration afraid of showing the American people?"
Klobuchar objects to proceeding before the 102,000 documents being withheld by the White House are turned over to the committee. She notes that executive privilege has never been used to withhold documents during a Supreme Court nomination. Not for Kagan, not for Roberts. https://t.co/Y4FEkbc74a
Sheldon Whitehouse makes a good point. The committee is being denied 100,000 documents on the basis of "executive privilege" but no one has actually asserted executive privilege.		It's just a letter from Kavanaugh's friend Bill on his law firm's stationary. https://t.co/dAfi5glaqd
Chuck Grassley says Corey Booker is taking advantage of his "decency and integrity." Very weird. https://t.co/2tIgskpBQp
Harris, Klobuchar, and Blumenthal immediately object to the fact that they just received 42,000 pages of documents about Kavanaugh. Ask for hearing to be postponed.  		Chairman Grassley just talks over them and continues his introduction. https://t.co/HNNENZqCyf
@jayrosen_nyu This is fascinating and highlights how incoherent Facebook's position is -- they claim to be fighting misinformation but are actively partnering with Fox News. They are evening paying them to produce more content for the platform.
This, from Kavanaugh's opening, is total BS 		We spend these confirmation hearings pretending that the Supreme Court is something it is not and has never been https://t.co/aPtxhDsEtr

6. Nevertheless, the hearing is worth follow closely - the conventional wisdom that Kavanaugh's confirmation is predetermined is a narrative constructed by Republicans to depress opposition and public interest		Until there are 50 votes, it's not over		https://t.co/ZnpyiaQHx7
5. Kavanaugh plays a role too. When asked about substantive issues, he'll answer with legal buzzwords that sound good but mean nothing. 		For example, he told Senator Collins Roe v. Wade is "settled law."		That's meaningless, as Lindsey Graham explained 		https://t.co/ZnpyiaQHx7 https://t.co/HqTkD3bPP2
4. Bill has decided, based on a request from Trump, to not disclose another 100,000 documents from Kavanaugh's tenure. 		Oddly, Trump is asserting "executive privilege" over documents from the Bush White House and Bill is doing along with it 		https://t.co/ZnpyiaQHx7
3. For the rest of the White House documents, the GOP has replaced the normal process by the National Archives with Kavanaugh's "close friend" Bill Burck. 		Instead of a neutral party deciding what should be disclosed, it's Bill. 		https://t.co/ZnpyiaQHx7
2. Grassley, the chair of the judiciary committee, didn't even request documents from Kavanaugh's time as Staff Secretary in the Bush White house 		This decision has kept secret  560,000 pages of files and 475,000 emails		There's no justification for it		https://t.co/ZnpyiaQHx7
1. Kavanaugh's hearing starts today. 		Here is the way it works: Kavanaugh an Republicans will work to reveal as little as possible about his history and legal views.		What they've done so far is extraordinary.		https://t.co/ZnpyiaQHx7
This is telling. In a real democracy, you could not lose the national vote by seven points and win a majority of seats.		But the Republicans have systematically rigged the maps in their favor. https://t.co/NeudBxnmoU

I still can't get over the fact that 2 weeks ago Trump's longtime personal lawyer stood up in a federal courtroom and, under oath, said he COMMITTED TWO FELONIES WITH TRUMP and absolutely nothing changed.		Nothing changed for Republicans or Democrats. It's like it never happened

5. Everyone should be open to everyone else's ideas is a nice safe space to feel good and intellectual but it doesn't really dispense with the hard work of figuring out right from wrong. 		Society moves forward as we sort these things out.
4. People view openness to an idea as intellectually superior to rejecting it 		But they are really both the same		You are presented with an idea and have to make the decision whether it should be taken seriously		Intellectually, both decisions are equally valid
3. Is this really the sign of a society that is closed off to new ideas. 		Seems like we may instead want to collectively raise the bar on the ideas that we choose to take seriously		The idea that would should be open to the "other side" when its a cesspool of lies seems weird
2. People are open to the idea Trump is fighting a secret pedophile ring run by Democrats and sending coded messages about it		People are open to the idea that voter fraud is a nationwide epidemic		People are open to the idea that the media invents stories out of thin air
1. Conventional wisdom on the internet is that people are too closed off to new ideas, stuck in "filter bubbles," etc.		I think sometimes this is true		But isn't the bigger problem that people are open to too many new ideas?		Let me explain

@RossGinsberg There are a few Republicans speaking out. What is he doing?
@RossGinsberg Not mentioning Trump is not opposition.
The widely held idea that there is a significant faction of the right that would reject Trump and Trumpism -- frequently expressed through the 2016 Republican primary and general election -- was a key factor in Trump's victory. 		We should learn from the past, not erase it.
There is absolutely no meaningful opposition to Trump from the right. The right is Trump's enabler. He's not doing this alone. He's doing this with the full support from nearly the entire Republican Party. 		They idea that there is a bipartisan coalition against Trump is a myth. https://t.co/PMA9Uhm19j
@SenatorCollins @lisamurkowski Graham:		1. Explains why saying something is "settled law" does not mean the decision cannot be overturned		2. Says he expects Roe to be reconsidered by the court		3. Says he expects Kavanaugh to cast a vote on whether or not to overturn Roe

9. Bottom line: The Trump campaign's defense against conspiracy is based around the claim no one had any advance warning of the hacked emails		This is only true if Papadopolous didn't tell anyone 		It's a hard claim to swallow
8. This is similar to what Papadopolous allegedly told a new acquaintance at a Chicago nightclub in April 2008. 		Except in that version, Papadopolous told Sessions about the Clinton emails Russia had and Sessions' encouraged him to find out more		https://t.co/qqzLNbU2eg
7. In Papadopolous' sentencing memo, he reveals that, when he suggested setting up a meeting between Putin and Trump, Sessions was enthusiastic and told him to pursue it		This contradicts Sessions' public claims that he advised against it		https://t.co/NZnLwawqyZ
6. The entire Russia investigation started after Papadopolous told the former Australian Foreign Minister, Downer, about how Russia had hacked Clinton's emails		Papadopolous' wife says he doesn't remember telling Downer that		What else has he "forgotten"?		https://t.co/JY3rrf6dzk
5. Indeed, a member of the Trump campaign, John K. Mashburn, testified he received an email from Papadopolous alerting the campaign that Russia had hacked Clinton's emails before they were ever released		Mysteriously, this email has disappeared		https://t.co/AQrxdEFeoV
4. Papadopolous' sentencing memo describes him as desperate to impress the Trump campaign. 		Hard to square this with the idea that he would keep this explosive information secret, while telling people outside of the campaign about it
3. Papadopolous says that Misfud told him about the email hacking but HE DID NOT TELL ANYONE ELSE ON THE CAMPAIGN		At the same time, Papadopolous was happy to tell lots of other random people, including the Greek Foreign Minister in May 2016
2. Papadopolous pled guilty to lying to FBI about when he spoke to Prof. Joseph Misfud and what Misfud told him		Misfud told him about Russia hacking Clinton campaign emails while Papadopolous was a member of the Trump campaign		Now Papadopolous says he's being honest		Is he?
1. George Papadopolous will be sentenced for lying to the FBI on September 7		I don't think it's being fully appreciated how central his role could be to the larger Russia investigation		Let's review
