These two simple changes allow hard-working MD’ers to keep more of what they earn. Expanding the EITC for single filers can engage more young men in the workforce, reduce the racial wage gap, and grow the middle class.
Del. @JheanelleW and Sen. @SenBillFerg introduced bills to increase the value of MD’s EITC to match 100% of the federal EITC (up to $529) and to increase the maximim income for the state EITC to $23,540 for single filers. Del. @Nick_Mosby also co-sponsored HB 585 &amp; HB 584.
Strengthening the EITC for single filers could impact more than 280,000 working Marylanders, putting them on a path to greater financial stability.
