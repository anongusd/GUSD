@BenjySarlin @SethAMandel All right, well, I’m certainly looking forward to someone picking up the torch of a balanced budget amendment and figuring out how to build support for shrinking deficits *a little*
@BenjySarlin @DouthatNYT @SethAMandel I do think, though, there’s a difference between “talking about ideas” with crossover appeal, as a few of Rand’s have on FP and surveillance, and “ideas” that are the purest manifestation of one’s base. Rand’s BBA support amounted to less than nothing.
@BenjySarlin @SethAMandel In the end, the Paul/AOC analogy proves the point that being an “ideas guy” is worthless. Paul’s ideas delivered us a Republican prez who transparently doesn’t give a shit about shrinking govt. How much were his ideas worth?
@BenjySarlin @SethAMandel Right, but virtually any other proposal will instantly be deemed insufficiently ambitious and thus unequal to the task. “Request for proposals” is more like “top this,” which is hard when your bill contains the left’s entire policy wishlist.
@BenjySarlin @SethAMandel Her whole rap re: the GND is that we have 10-12 years until doomsday and any alternate plan that doesn’t work within that timeline is a nonstarter. Is there any doubt she’ll oppose some more modest, viable climate change bill if it gains momentum?
@BenjySarlin @SethAMandel Insofar as Rand is celebrated as an ideas guy, it’s because some of his ideas have crossover appeal to the left. AOC’s ideas are hard left. And she doesn’t present herself as starting a policy debate; the GND is sold as “this or extinction”
@BenjySarlin @SethAMandel I don’t know how “prominent” I’d call Rand after his 2016 finish. And has Rand ever floated anything that attracted an iota of the media coverage and base excitement that AOC and the GND received?

@BenjySarlin @DouthatNYT We’re in a weird spot where I’m like, “There’s a market for your ideas on my side, Benjy!” and you’re like, “No way, it’s futile”
@BenjySarlin @DouthatNYT The first way to overcome it is merely to show the other side that there’s some common ground. Trump gets to set the dividing line because righty populists are cocooned in their own media. She should try to break through it instead of reinforcing it with “GOPers are bad” talk
@DouthatNYT @BenjySarlin Yes, I think the temptation to rant at Tucker for being a racist would overwhelm the opportunity to find economic common ground. But it’s a missed opportunity.
@BenjySarlin Man, that’s too cynical even for me. I think some right-wing populists who never, ever encounter leftists in a neutral/friendly format would find it revelatory to see how much they agree with AOC on certain economics
@BenjySarlin I can easily imagine her and Carlson getting along quite well for a segment on his show if they called a truce on cultural stuff and talked economics
@BenjySarlin More robust entitlements, higher taxes on the rich, ending corporate welfare. Basically “fuck the ruling class and make them pay for more stuff.” I think Tucker already did a segment on how she was right to oppose corporate welfare for Amazon
