@SenTedCruz asks why the Administration is allowing so few Christian refugees to the U.S.
@SenTedCruz, thank you for your leadership and for your efforts at today's refugee resettlement hearing. Telling it like it is.
Sen. Cruz notes, many Americans are concerned about the "willful blindness" by our government.  Amen!
Sen. Tillis: "This issue should be about the integrity of the process."  (And there is no integrity of the process.)
Sen Franken thinks that number of Syrians brought to the U.S. is a disgrace. We need more, because of the words on the Statue of Liberty.
Sen. Franken, the security of the American people must come FIRST. Your constitutional responsibility as a U.S. legislator is to assure that
Sen. Sessions.  We need to be "in touch with reality" when we (gov't) do the vetting of refugees.
These 3 gov't witnesses should be run out of town. Our security is in their hands and they are willfully ignorant. Grassroots, get involved.
Sen. Vitter notes FBI Comey's comments re unvettable syrian refugees.  Gov't witness says his statement has been stretched.  Wow!
@Mrbumbles11 You must be mistaken. R government tells us that there is no threat to the US. What happens "over there" will not happen here.
@american121 Unfortunately, if this madness doesn't stop, one day they will no longer be oblivious.
Witness: There is no evidence of honor killings with Syrian refugees. Nothing to see here folks. All is well. Bring them in.
The refugee resettlement problem will only b addressed when U.S. citizens speak up. Relying on our government is a waste of time &amp; money.
Considering threat to U.S. by unvettable Syrian refugees, the White House doesn't consider "nationality issues"? We should all feel safe.
Henshaw:  Doesn't know Syrian #'s. White house hasn't taken interest in "nationality issues" when it comes 2 refugee resettlement 2 the U.S.
Simon Henshaw: White house still has not given a target for Syrians...but expected to be above 12,500.
So far, all opening statements at this congressional refugee hearing have been nothing but an example of how r gov't just doesn't get it.
Today's Syrian refugee problem has nothing to do with lack of compassion by the U.S. and everything to do with national security. Period.

If watching this #SOTU isn't enough motivation for each one of us to get off the couch and elect a real leader, I don't know what is.
Lecturing to the American people about hurting the feeling of Muslims?  How about lecturing jihadists about not killing us? #insanity
The world does NOT "respect us."  When we replace the current President with a strong leader, perhaps it one day will again.
No, a weak President serves as a "recruitment tool" for our enemies, not Guantanamo.

Yeah...how has your "patient and disciplined strategy" worked for us so far?
Talk about your emptying Gitmo &amp; sending jihadists back to their battle stations.  How about mentioning that in your remarks, Mr. President?
Taking credit for OBL.  Shameful.
"We need to call them what they are. Killers &amp; fanatics." No -- they are Muslim jihadists. YOU need to call them what they r, Mr. President.
The President will not say "radical Islam" when defining the enemy -- we need a leader who will.
No...we are threatened by radical, political Islam.  Say it, Mr. President! The nation is waiting for you to say it.
"Surveys show that our standing around the world is higher" than when President Obama took office? What surveys is he referring to?
No, Mr. President -- the world no longer sees us as "the most powerful nation."
President Obama has no sense of gravitas in this year's "laugh a minute" #SOTU.
MPAC tweets followers 2 "tweet us your thoughts" on Presidents SOTU and they'll take them "to senior White House officials." Enough said.

Joint committee moved to a Closed Session for the duration of the discussion to discuss matters which are classified in nature.
Daris Long:  We need to be honest about what we are doing.
Daris Long doing an excellent job speaking about/educating how intricate Islam is.  Not just a religion.
Nice to see correct def of Jihad and Taqiya spoken openly by Members of Congress is today's hearing.
Emotional and powerful statement by Daris Long.
Mr. Long clearly and understandably is frustrated with the military.  My heart goes out to him.
Mr. Long:  The gov't is denying Little Rock as a terrorist attack.  In doing so, two soldiers have been abandoned on the battlefield.
Daris Long, father of Army Private William Andrew Long, killed at a military recruitment center, is now up and making opening statement.
Rep. McCaul - Ft. Hood incident was "political correctness" gone awry.
Rep. Michael McCaul (R-TX) up now. Amazed that JTTF in San Diego had info on Hasan and the info wasn't shared w/ Ft. Hood.
Rep. Janice Hahn (D-CA) questioning witnesess now. Says that she thinks the Ft. Hood incident was due to a failure of military leadership.
Next up:  Rep. Tim Walberg (R-MI)
Lt. Col Reid Sawyer says that Christian right are also threat.(No folks, this is not a dream, this is REAL dialogue in the U.S. Congress)
Military brass respond to Rep. Richardson that the threat is NOT limited to only Islamist extremists.  (Loaded question)
Stockton:  Al-Qaeda and its affiliates are viewed as the primary threat.
Next up: Rep. Laura Richardson (D-CA)
The military brass is tap dancing all over the committee room this morning.  How can we defeat the enemy when our military doesn't get it?!
Rep. Duncan: the Army's new threat awareness and reporting program refuses to identify the threat of violent Islamist extremism.
Rep. Jeff Duncan: We need to be able to identify the enemy if we are ever going to defeat them.
Next up, a true patriot, Rep. Jeff Duncan.
Next up:  Sen. Mark Pryor (D-Ark)
Lungren asks if having "Soldier of Allah" on your business card is a behavioral indicator.  Stockton refuses to answer and Lungren is angry.
Folks - you have to watch Rep. Dan Lungren's dialogue with Paul Stockton and you must demand changes to our nation's approach to the enemy.
Paul Stockton -- an embarrasment to our military and to our nation.  Unbelievable.
Stockton does not want to use word Islamist at all.  Keeps saying that we are not at war with Islam.  Rep. Lungren will not let it go.
Wow.  Wow. Wow.  Our military will NOT admit that we are at war with Islamist extremism. They will only use the term al-Qaeda.
Stockton vehemenly says that our nation is NOT at war with violent Islamist extremism.
Stockton ways we are NOT at war with violent Islam extremism.
Rep. Jackson Lee gets Hasan's name wrong....calls him Captain Hussein.  Ugh.
Rep. Jackson Lee wants to change the direction of the discussion and talk about the many different faiths of our military.
Rep. Jackson Lee is up.  Hang on to your hats, folks!
Lt. Col. Sawyer:  The DOD has had extensive outreach to the Muslim American community.
Rep. Turner: It would serve our interests if we were to understand more what is going on within Islam.  Have we spoken to Imams, etc?
Rep. Bob Turner up next.  Rep. Anthony Wiener's replacement.
Stockton: The way forward is to focus on indicators of violent behavior and radicalization so we can intervene early on.
Stockton: We need representation from all religions in our Armed Forces.
Rep. Sanchez inserts for the record statements of Muslim servicemen - about how they are looked at "differently."
Rep. Sanchez: We need to plan ahead so we don't have "over-reactions."
Next up, Rep. Loretta Sanchez.
Rep. Cravaack: I find it frustrating that we are playing politics on threat assessment.  We owe it to our troops to identify the enemy.
Lt. Col. Sawyer: Training materials need to be "fact based."  (OK...but again, where is the info from these training materials coming from?)
Stockton: Breakdown in info/communication flow that have now been fixed.
Ranking Member Thompson to Secy Stockton: What are the lessons learned from Ft. Hood?
Lieberman:  How are we securing military recruitment centers across the nation?  Stockton: Law enforcement are working together to do so.
Jim Stuteville: They've adopted a professional training program.  (I wonder where they get the material from?)
Lieberman:  Is there a training program like that going on now?  Stockton says "yes sir."
Lieberman: "concerned that the Pentagon has not implemented" training program that will allow personell 2 recognize signs of radicalization.
Frightening responses by our military brass (but not surprising).
Stockton:  Primary threat is al-Qaeda and it's affiliates.  (And herein lies the major problem, my friends).
Jim Stuteville: If it's reported that Inspire magazine is being reviewed by Armed Forces, they'll look into it.  (again...wow)
King: We've learned that Inspire Magazine is available to the Armed Forces.  (Wow)
King:  The enemy today is extreme violent Islam.  We never used to shy away from defining the enemy. We are being politically correct today
Jim Stuteville, U.S. Army Counterintelligence Operations Sr. Advisor responds to King with military mumbo jumbo.  Outrageous.
King:  Why does the Army feel it is now not appropriate to define the enemy when we used to do it 16 years ago?
Stockton:Al Qaeda recruitment efforts r ongoing & he is working 2 protect r servicemembers about it. More response must be in closed session
King to Secy Stockton: How successful has al Qaeda been in recruiting members of our military?
Sawyer: most disturbing trend is the focus of jihadists on military targets.
Next up:  Colonel Reid Sawyer, West Point Combating Terrorism Center Director
As expected, military brass is explaining all that's been done 2 protect r servicemen/women.But do they truly understand the Islamist enemy?
Paul Stockton - 1st witness --  is the Asst Secretary of Defense for Homeland Defense & America's Security Affairs
Stockton: I pledge to continue strengthening the preparedness of our domestic military against the homegrown terrorist threat.
Stockton: the threat that we are discussing today is serious and it is enduring.
Error....sorry, Secretary Paul Stockton is first witness up.
Colonel Sawyer -- 1st witness up.
Chairman Pete King has released an Investigative Report focusing on homegrown terror threat to military communities.
Chair King notes that Rep. Keith Ellison has stated that he wants to submit a statement for the record and when he does it will be accepted.
Sen. Collins: Whether radicalization occurs in prisons or via the internet, the threat that is posed must be acknowledged and addressed.
We are over a half hour into the hearing and still on opening statements by the leaders of each Committee.  This will be a long one, folks.
Sen. Collins: The Administration has been unwilling to name violent Islamist extremism as the threat.
As usual, Mr. Thompson and others on the Democratic side of the aisle don't get it -- or don't WANT to get it.  Shame on them.
Thompson: A congressional hearing focusing on religion & the military is likely 2 harm unit cohesion & undermine morale within r military
Lieberman: Our gov't has to recognize at some point who the enemy is and call it by its exact name.
Lieberman: American service members and their families are increasingly in the terrorist scope both in the U.S. and overseas.
Lieberman: Since 2001 law enforcement have thrwarted & prosecuted more than 30  plots or attacks on military targets w/in the U.S.
Lieberman: the only Americans who have lost their lives in r homeland to terrorists since 9/11 have been killed at U.S. military facilities.
Lieberman: The record shows that the U.S. military has become a direct target of violent Islamist extremism here in the United States.
Lieberman: There is no subject that should unite us more than the threat that Islamist extremists pose to our homeland and nation.
King: These hearings on Islamic radicalization are critical and we cannot back down because of political correctness.
King:  A growing number of threats are to the families of our military.
King: The total number of radicalized troops in our military is more than originally acknowledge or realized.
King:  We have an obligation to act on this growing threat.  Our troops should not be in harms way here at home and yet they are.
This is the 4th hearing in a series of hearings on Islamic radicalization in the U.S. King is carrying through on his promise to the nation.
Chairman Pete King makes opening statement. Focus on "Islamist radicalization" within our military communities. Mr. King-defining the threat

Rep. Richardson and witness Dunleavy going at it.   She is arrogant and disrespectful in my opinion.  #a4a #PeteKing
Rep. Richardson reads def of radicalization in Webster's Dictionary & asks if various gangs can b defined as radicalized.  #a4a #PeteKin

Witness Smith:  "Behavioral Indicators" are necessary to separate jihadis from others in the prison system.  #a4a #PeteKing
Witness Downing keeps referring to a "hijacked" faith.  It's the PURE following of the faith...not a "hijacked" one!  #a4a #PeteKing

Downing:The way that prisoners r exposed to Islam is one problem --a "hijacked" version.(I wonder if he's read Islamic law?)  #a4a #PeteKing

First Witness up: Patrick Dunleavy
Rep. Thompson -- trying to distract from the issue at hand, by talking about "lone wolves" and gang violence.  Amazing.  #a4a #PeteKing
Rep. Thompson: Focusing on Islamic radicalization takes our attention away from the gang violence in prison.  #a4a #PeteKing
Rep. Thompson: Opportunities for radicalization in prison are few.....(HUH?)  #a4a #PeteKing
Rep.Thompson: Islam is fastest growing religion among prisoners.Most poor, black & upset about racism, not mid-East politics. #a4a #PeteKing
Pete King: 1st hearing on Islamic radicalization was met w/ unnecessary hysteria.  This issue should not be a partisan issue. #a4a #PeteKing

Though the mainstream media will spin this speech otherwise, my vote: it was terrible.  All meaningless fluff.  #a4a
Very telling that O's full speech about mid-East barely mentions Israel. That's consistent with the admin's approach to the region overall.
Obama: Moving forward now on the basis of "territory and security" is good first step toward solving the problem. #a4a
Um, how can negotiating be successful between Israel and Palestinians if the goal of the latter is the total elimination of Israel? #a4a
Obama: Goal: A viable Palestine and a secure Israel. #a4a
What are the SPECIFICS, Mr., President????  #a4a
In "concluding" his speech, President brings up Israel...almost as an afterthought.  Wow. #a4a
How do we give $$ to the mid-East when we have none?  What about our debt, Mr. President?
Once again, all the President is proposing for the mid-east region is a mere fantasy, because he is not addressing the ideology involved.
Obama: the greatest untapped resource in the region is the talent of its people.
Obama: re: rights of women:  countries are more prosperous and peaceful when women are in power.  What about Shariah?
Obama: All faiths should be respected in the region.
Obama: In the months ahead America must use all our influence to encourage reform in the region.
Obama: You can't have a real dialogue when members of the peaceful opposition are in jail.
Obama; It will be the policy of the U.S. to support reform throughout the region.
Obama: The U.S. opposes violence and oppression against the people of the region.  (applause from audience). #a4a
Obama: We have a stake not just in the stability of nattions by in the self determination of individuals.
My interpretation:  So far, Obama's speech has lots of fluff and no substance.  As usual, unfortunately.  #a4a
The word "Israeli" finally mentioned!
Obama: The people of the mid East have achieved more changes in 6 months than terrorists have in a decade.
Obama glorifying the protesters in the Middle East and N. Africa....what a distorted view of the truth.  Pathetic.
Obama: The West has been blamed as the source of all ills by those who had held power in the mid East.
Obama comparing our nation's patriots with those who protested in Egypt...does he include the Muslim Brotherhood?  R they Patriots too?
Why doesn't President admit that the "problem" isn't al-Qaeda, but the ideology of radical Islam?  It's still only about al-Qaeda 4 r govt.
Obama: We are bound by the changes that are going on in the mid east and N. Africa. #a4a
Obama: For 6 months we have witnessed an extroadinary change in mid east and N. Africa.
And here's the President.  Here we go folks.... #4a

Sen. Graham to Holder: We have some people who r good candidates for trials in military commissions. Where do we put these people?
Sen. Graham -- was supportive of closing Gitmo, but it doesn't look like it will happen.  Holder agrees.  Bad approach, Sen. Graham.

Rep. Gohmert: Judge felt that there was plenty of evidence to keep those on the un-indicted co-conspirator list.
Rep. Gohmert asks Holder if he is aware that Judge Scalise felt that groups on the unindicted co-conspirator list should STAY on it.
Rep. Louie Gohmert's turn with AG Holder.
Rep. Franks to Holder: Did anyone in DOJ stop further prosecutions of the HLF case?  Holder: NO.
Rep. Franks to Holder - Bush admin DID prosecute during the Holy Land Foundation trial and got 108 convictions. So stop blaming them.
Rep. Franks to Holder: Do you intend to prosecute those HLF un-indicted co-conspirators?  (And stop punting to the Bush admin)
Rep. Franks to Holder: which individuals are responsible for scuttling the HLF prosecutions of un-indicted co-conspirators?
Here we go! Rep. Trent Franks (R-AZ) asks Holder about Holy Land Foundation Trial and un-indicted co-conspirator list.
Chabot notes to Holder that "Gitmo Cocktails" -- or fecal matter, etc. are thrown by detainees at Gitmo guards. Wow.
Rep. Steve Chabot (R-OH) makes point that waterboarding didn't take place at Gitmo & that prisoners are treated very well there.
Holder...more tap dancing on KSM versus bin Laden issue.  He should be on dancing with the stars!
Lundgren: Asks Holder whether he would have opposed military trial for OBL like he does for KSM....putting the screws to Holder.  Love it.
Lundgren asks Holder how it could "shock the conscience" to waterboard KSM, but not to kill bin Laden....
Lundgren:  Could we have used the same techniques (killing instead of capturing him) to KSM?  Holder: yes.
Lundgren: If we got bin Laden because of "enhanced interrogation techniques" would he (Holder) support it?
In response to Rep. Dan Lundgren, Holder says he approves of how the military killed bin Laden. #a4a

@babygirljacoby should be. Check with the Committee. Remember, they work for YOU!
Both Myrick and King plan to have more hearings on these issues.  It's critical that they and other MOCs hear from U that this is important.
Myrick ends the hearing.
Myrick: to Dr. Mansour.  Please finish your statement on ideology (he was cut off by the earlier vote).
@conniebrimmer Do u mean Republican Members of Congress?  No.  No MOC's testifying at this hearing.
Vidino: Egyptian MB is at odds with US policy with regard to foreign policy and intelligence sharing primarily.
Vidino in response to Rep.Ruppersberger: many MB in the US came here as students.  Global MB movement in West is a loose movement.
Ranking Member of full House Intelligence Committee, Rep Ruppersberger, at Subcommittee hearing.
Still no Republicans on Subcommittee in room.
Gutierrez: Members of the US Congress are opportunistic like the witnesses say the MB is.
Gutierrez asks witnesses if they think that the American Intelligence community has been hoodwinked or duped by the MB.  Shameful approach.
Gutierrez asks if any witnesses have brought intelligence information re our National Security...insinuating that they can't speak to issue.
Mr. Gutierrez: committee is targeting specific religious group and therefore will not accomplish anything. (I expect nothing less from him)
I know it's a busy day on the Hill and all, but this discussion in this subcommittee is historic and deserves the attention of ALL Members.
Where r all the Republican members of the subcommittee???  Never returned after the vote on the House floor!!!
Masoud responds that what the US should really be worried about is the Egyptian-Israeli relationship.
Thompson asks Masoud if the US should be concerned if MB gains power in Egypt.
Nathan Brown in response to question by Rep Thompson: We have to read what the MB says very carefully.
When I listen to Dr. Vidino I feel like I'm on a see-saw.  MB is good. MB is bad. MB has changed. MB is just good at hiding who they r.
Vidino: Some of the MB groups noted in the Holy Land Foundation trial may have "changed."
Vidino: Memorandum and wiretaps really showed some "dark features" of the MB. Some of the groups in memo have gotten better at their facade.
Myrick asks Vidino about Holy Land Foundation trial memo.
Satloff: Certain parts of our Intelligence community have been fascinated with the MB which limits true analysis of the group.
Satloff: MB is extremely opportunistic.
Myrick: We've seen mixed messages from the MB. Removed it's bylaws from the English website but preach another message on their Arabic site.
OK -- opening statements are over. Q and A time.
Masoud: MB in Egypt isn't a threat to the U.S.  (Unbelievable)
Masoud: MB approach is not a fringe view in the Middle East.
Masoud: by seeking to re establish the Caliphate they mean more of a "European Union" than anything else. ???????
Masoud: MB in Egypt wants a more "virtuous" society.
Masoud: Praises Myrick and her MB videos for distinguishing between ISLAMIC and ISLAMIST.
Masoud says to Myrick that he's watched 2 of her videos on the MB and she gives them two much credit.
Next up -- and final witness -- Terek Masoud
Brown: U.S. Should be willing to work with all "legitimate" leaders in foreign govts. MB in egypt is a headache for us not cancer.
Brown: U,S. Has no real policy toward the MB.  He doesn't think we need one -- only with countries in which MB exist.
Brown: no reason for panic re: MB's rise in Egypt.
Brown: MB is telling the truth when they say they r peaceful, but regards violence as legitimate in case of foreign occupation, ie Israel
Dr. Brown up next.
Rep Myrick back in room.  Waiting on Ranking Member Thompson and then we'll be all set.  He's here.  Here we go.
Rep Myrick back in room.  Here we go.
@borgnetdotnet Not sure, as I'm in the hearing room and unaware of what the full House is doing now. Check C-SPAN.
Place Jeopardy theme song here...still waiting for series of votes to finish up so hearing can resume. Don't change that channel!!
Myrick gave CAIR and MPAC less time to stir up the troops.  Interesting result.
Second hearing on radical Islam in two months.  Believe it or not, this is progress folks.  Keep speaking up about it and it will continue.
Forgive the delay folks but House is in session and there is vote on the Floor.  When this happens MOCs must stop what they r doing and vote
Votes have been called. Three 5 minute votes on House floor.  Hearing in recess till MOCs return. Stand by!
Difficult to understand Dr. Mansour as he has a thick accent. Hoping to get more about what he wants to get across in Q and A.
Peter King, a member of the Subcom just arrived to hearing room.
Next witness-Terek Masoud: Islam is a religion of peace.
Vidino: There is a difference between "engagement and dialogue" (re govt interaction w/ MB groups). OK next witness.
Vidino: CAIR, while not an ideal one, is a necessary partner with the FBI.  Really?  There's no one else, huh?
Vidino: CAIR "traces its origins to the Brotherhood."
Go 2 House Intelligence Comm's website 2 get info on witnesses testifying (if U didn't get our e-mail today) Sign up with us 4 next time.
Dr. Lorenzo Vidino up next
Satloff: US must strike balance between awareness of MB and giving them the attention they want to gain credibility in Egypt.
Well behaved audience so far.
Robert Satloff up first.  Should the MB gain power in Egypt it will become a different place. But we should not assume that MB will succeed.
Thompson: We don't want to offend any American (by this hearing).
Thompson: Today's hearing is not about terrorism. The MB is not a state dept designated terrorist group. Wow.
Ranking Member Thompson:This hearing can be productive, but must not become a witch hunt.
Myrick: Our govt is playing checkers while the MB is playing chess.
Packed room.  Line outside waiting to get in.  If u leave the room for any reason, you go to end of line again.
Myrick: It doesn't matter whether the MB is violent or not.  Must look at the ideology that drives them.
Myrick:purpose of this hearing is to discuss the MB both in Egypt and Mid East.
And here we go.
7 minutes to go and I'm in the hearing room. 3rd row. All the usual suspects here as well...

@mrenkidu No. I'm on the Hill.  C-span is broadcasting it though, as is the HS Committee on-line.
Rep Pascrell - Another MOC rude to family of radicalized Muslim boy.  Arrogant, disrespectful, rude. Sorry folks, I'm calling it as I see it
Rep Green says that we should have hearing on Christian radicalization.  Huh???????? These r your elected officials people....
Bledsoe to Rep Green:-Today we are not talking about the KKK. We are talking about radical Islam.
Rep Green-Brings up the KKK and how they speak against the Jews..and African Americans.  Audience laughs.
Jasser: Until political Islam is separated from the religion we will never stop terrorism.
Dr. Jasser: It is critical to understand political Islam.
Shame on Democrats on the committee for talking down to the witnesses whose family members were radicalized. And audience laughs at them 2.
Blackberry running out of power with all my tweeting.  Hope I can last until the very end of the hearing!
Sheriff Baca tapdancing around question of whether he would continue to work with CAIR is they were affiliated with Hamas. Refuses to answer
Lots of vocal. CAIR supporters with me in room.
Another attack from Dem on Jasser. Asks if he is qualified 2 talk on issue.  Audience erupts in laughter and some applause.  Disgraceful.
Sheriff Baca:  Message to Muslims in America: Get smarter on your own faith.  Ouch.
Terrorism is a tactic. Baca saying CAIR opposes terrorism is only about a tactic not about overall goal of Islamists.
Sheriff Baca defending Southern CA CAIR
If you're watching my tweets from this hearing and are concerned about radical Islam please don't sit idle--join us; www.actforamerica.org.
Lots of focus on the danger of CAIR at today's hearing.  A good thing.
Rep Broun: when I was in the Marines we were taught to know your enemy. This is not about religion. Another enemy is political correctness
As always--impressed by Dr. Jasser.
Bihi-  A kid does not walk over to the internet one day and blow himself up the next. Radicalization takes years.  Don't blame the internet.
Snickers from audience when Dr. Jasser once again says that Muslims need to address the radicalization of their community.
Bihi: His mosque calls him and his family "tools of infidels"
Congressman: Radical Islam is the threat. Well hallelujah!!
King: Gavelling down Rep Jackson-Lee who won't stop talking even after her time has expired. Lots of words-no substance.Usual grandstanding.
Rep. Jackson-Lee, please stop.  Your comments about how this is all about religion is showing your ignorance about this issue.
Rep Shiela Jackson Lee -- The Constitution is "in pain".  What a piece of work she is.  I'm in pain hearing her comments.
Clearly, the Muslim audience at hearing disagrees with Jasser's assertion that Muslim community is responsible 4 helping solve the problem.
I'm embarrassed at how Dr. Jasser is being treated by Committee Dems and disgusted by the majority Muslim audience at the hearing.
Rep. Sanchez-minorities are intimidated by American law enforcement.  Wow.  Talk about getting off subject!
Rep Sanchez - another MOC with unnecessarily rude exchange with Dr. Jasser.   Audience again laughing.
Bihi-Mosque pushed his family to not cooperate with law enforcement. He was intimidated.
Baca fumbling over question about what he thinks of orgs that tell their community to not cooperate with law enforcement-- referencing CAIR
Ranking Member Thompson is disgraceful and rude to Dr. Jasser and audience is laughing at that rudeness
Jasser: Blind profiling is wrong but smart research is necessary.
Bledsoe: He hopes his testimony and warnings will help other American families.
Bledsoe:  A lot of people are still in denial that America has a radicalization problem.
Jasser: Mosque funding must be looked at.
Jasser: There is a nonviolent radical  ideology in many mosques. The Muslim community must stop turning a blind eye and pointing fingers.
Q and A time.
Baca--another clueless official.  Focusing on religion with no mention of ideology.  Waste of time.
I've never seen a grand intro like that for a congressional witness (Sheriff Baca)  Unnecessary.
Sheriff Baca from LA is up next.
Witness: the Muslim American community has been kidnapped by groups like CAIR.  Hearing room is silent.
His Mosque worked with CAIR to discredit him.  CAIR uses the Muslim community.
He invested in his nephew's mosque to invest in the future of Muslim American children.
Next up: Somali man whose nephew was radicalized.
Bledsoe: It was my son this time but America needs to understand that next time it can be your child. "God help us."
Bledsoe: Something is wrong with Muslim community in Nashville. Americans are sitting around doing nothing about radical Muslims.
Bledsoe; His normal American son converted to Islam and changed completely. Let family dog go because in Islam dogs r unclean.
Mr. Bledsoe: his son let the family dog go because Muslims consider dogs unclean. Changed personality completely. Changed his name.
Mr. Bledsoe up next.
Lots of hearing audience frowns as Dr. Jasser gives his remarks.
Jasser: You can't just blame Awlaki for Major Hassan.
@LisaCRitchie thanks.
Jasser:  Muslim radicalism is a problem that only Muslims can solve.
Zuhdi Jasser up next.
First panel done. Next panel up.
Wolf: Soon will be introducing legislation creating a "Team B" to change approach identifying and addressing Muslim domestic radicalization.
Wolf; CAIR tells American Muslims to not cooperate w/ FBI.
Wolf: CAIR has labeled everyone who discusses concern about radical Islam as a bigot or "Islamophobe."
Rep Frank Wolf exposing CAIR as an arm of Hamas.  Thank you!! LISTEN UP FOLKS!!
Did Rep Ellison cry like that when 3000 people died on 9/11?
Rep Ellison openly weeping
Love it.  Rep Ellison pointing out the KKK, and the Holocaust museum shooter while trying to convince us about the threats to the US
Rep Ellison: Muslim radicals in the U.S. do not represent the entire Muslim community in the U,S.  And who said they did?
Rep. Ellison; The committee's approach is contrary to American values and could be dangerous to r nation.
Rep. Ellison up as next witness.
Rep. Dingell first witness. Brings up McCarthyism.
Ranking Member Thompson saying that these hearings will breed new terrorists.  He should be ashamed of himself for saying such foolishness.
Rep Thompson saying that King needs to focus on ALL radicals, not just Muslims.  Um....really?
King using poster that shows attempted terrorist attacks on r nation and names of those who tried to kill us.  All radical Muslims.

Napolitano actually says that threat is "Islamist in nature" in response to question. What a BIG step...& seemed quite difficult to get out.
Leiter says it's a "good thing" there is no 1 Fed agency focused on "violent extremism" in the U.S. So multiple govt bureaucracy is better?
OK, Leiter is getting a little better. Has mentioned  word "Islamic" once. Mentions "Al-Qaeda, Al-Shabab, Hamas & Hezbollah." Common theme?
STRIKE TWO!  Mueller makes NO mention of radical Islam or jihadists in opening statement!  Willful ignorance by those sworn to protect us.
Mueller: "Motivations & backgrounds of extremists vary."  REALLY?  I see one common denominator.....(no mention of Islamists yet, folks...)
OK, Mr. Mueller...you're up at bat next.  Will you identify WHO these "extremists" are?  (theme from Jeopardy here)...
Napolitano: "It is impossible to guarantee that there will never be another attack."  You bet-especially when u refuse 2 identify the enemy.
So far, no mention of WHO these terrorists ARE by our esteemed DHS Secretary Napolitano.  Amazing...and quite frightening...
