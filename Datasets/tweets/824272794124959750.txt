@sportsmom9433 English would be preferable here, but my attitude is really towards someone like you that would be so blind as to follow a known con man without question. Good luck in life.
@fyremedic1200 Good talking with you. May your life be full filled
@fyremedic1200 I did well financially under obama, no doubt. Things have remained the same for me under 45. I hope it stays that way. I know you’re not an obama fan, but he saved my moms life by insisting insurers had to cover preexisting conditions.  Although she has since passed, I’m thankful
@fyremedic1200 It was their money that we had sanctioned. I’m sure you have heard of this, but really research it. As far as dabbling, not every pr has ran around on their wife. I don’t think that’s the actual issue, at least not for me. I don’t care who is sleeping with who. It’s the $$ paid.
@sportsmom9433 Aw Don’t worry, keep bussing those tables &amp; you’ll get out of the trailer eventually. Work hard. Hysterical though how you think “left woman” are sleeping their way to money and scoops whatever that is. I’m not sure if anyone is checking with the hookers to see if they are L or R
@fyremedic1200 I have found the opposite, but nope, fully employed, raised 3 kids and own my own house, 2 cars, dog and have some money banked. I’m actually doing alright which could change, but for now,  money wise, all is good.
@fyremedic1200 Okay... I don’t have time to explain economics to you, but the tax cut for the 1% put us into a very deep debt.  They are calling ss entitlements now and trying to cut them. Obama was able to hold a conversation and actually spoke to the people when was trumps last press?
@fyremedic1200 Why are you hiring. Lol. I have a great job actually, but thanks for checking.
@mitchellvii Wrong, they are going to laugh in his face and tell him to go fuck himself.  The other leading countries will move on without us. Sad. Welcome to the new banana republic formerly known as the United States.
@TrumpLoyal @beyaself1 @fyremedic1200 Those would be your words. I never said those in trailer parks were already, I said they should get out and see more of the world and meet people that might be different from themselves. We are connected in more ways than not.
@beyaself1 @TrumpLoyal @fyremedic1200 Nope, that would be wrong. As a trump girl I’m sure you know the position well. Some of us have morals. You should try and catch some. Get out of the trailer park and see the awesome world we live in.
@fyremedic1200 I don’t advocate death for trump, I just think we need a leader that knows what he is doing. As far as the taxes, I haven’t seen any extra in my paychecks, it just put our country into a deep debt. Now they are planning on cutting ss. A president should be for everyone, he’s not
@fyremedic1200 Why are you so stuck on hillary. It’s been over a year, but you guys always refer back to hillary and obama. What is the fascination there that you just can’t let them go?  What does trump sleeping around on his wife have to do with hillary?  Or paying them off?
@nprpolitics Of course he does, he owes them for the presidency.
@David_Leavitt Let us know how it feels when someone in your family does the same thing. Empathy would benefit you. Try and catch some

@butterfly_magyc @catmommy14 @senorrinhatch @KyleKashuv This was actually about one person (the poor scared single mom), not a bunch, but I’m good if we ban some guns and then push to register all guns and force people to carry insurance on their guns.

@JohnSmiles1961 @SteveKingIA No, you’re opinion on the issue still wouldn’t matter.  Again, it’s not murder, but you keep going down your self righteous path. You can make abortion illegal again and go back to that time period, but they will still be occurring, but women will die in the process
@Glock_Coma_ @SteveKingIA Telling me that I most likely never said no?  Ripple it anyway you want. It’s exactly what you meant. A little passive aggressive there eh?

@JohnSmiles1961 @SteveKingIA As soon as you can produce a baby from your own body, you’re welcome to join the conversation. Until then, you should probably just stick to cleaning your guns.
Here is a mans thought process on how to reduce abortions. Never mind planned parenthood. Ladies, just keep your legs closed. https://t.co/8gBIk5HSqO
@Glock_Coma_ @SteveKingIA Well if men learned to keep their dicks in their pants, that would help as well. Nice try of putting it on the women though. You little fags are right there ready to jump on in.
@JohnSmiles1961 @SteveKingIA Because it’s a fetus, not a baby. Jesus. Take a damn biology class so a woman raped should have to give birth because you say so?  What if the mom will die due to the pregnancy. Screw her?  Gotta have that baby.  So many kids waiting to be adopted. Let’s add to the unwanted
@Glock_Coma_ @SteveKingIA But it is the woman’s body. Maybe if men would actually stand up and help support the child, the number of abortions could be reduced. As soon as you are capable are giving birth,  we will let you have a say
@sand_in_my_toes @SteveKingIA How about all babies born since it’s the right wing nut jobs that want all babies born but don’t give two shits whether they have food or housing or for that matter get shot to death in school. Sounds like it should be made into law
@mitchellvii Sounds about right. Who the hell wants to stand next to the ignorant moron we currently have in office. “I want to take their guns first and then they can have due process”. How high are you bill to buy into this

@annedecker Well sweetheart, don’t have an abortion then. Really simple. You’re ok with 17 year olds being mowed down in school though.  Planned parenthood so the low income can get birth control?  Or is it just the fetus your worried about, not who or how they’ll be taken care of when born
Truly horrifying that someone so uneducated in weapons can have a gun.  This is why the gun should be registered and she should pay a high insurance premium if she doesn’t complete at least 40 hours per year of training.  She should not be allowed to own an AR 15. https://t.co/TtIJS404hd
These are the type of people that should never own any type of gun. She can’t really shoot so she’s just going to spray bullets everywhere.  These are the ones that feel it’s their right to own a gun, but put the rest of us at risk. What a shame. https://t.co/TtIJS404hd
@annedecker @Billski66 @MikePZimmerman @ShootingIllustr @NRA @BERSAUSA_EAGLE Yikes. You are someone that should never own an AR 15. I’m sorry that you are going thru life so scared of everything. You will wish you could aim a bit better when you take out one of your kids while getting the “bad guy”
@annedecker Dear Anne, I too am grateful for my relatives that have fought in numerous wars for our freedoms as well as those in the military that I don’t even know.  I’m not sure what my type is that murders children?  You kinda jumped overboard there. I don’t own an AR15 so, not sure??
