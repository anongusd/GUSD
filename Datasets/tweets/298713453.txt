@CassyWearsHeels @SueAnnPorterONE @realDonaldTrump There are also videos of Schumer, Feinstein, Hillary and others speaking for the need of the Wall or Barriers!

@SueAnnPorterONE Brrrrrr
@RealJamesWoods Their blood is on the hands of both of you and anybody else who votes against the Wall!!!!	   By the way, What do you call THE WALL around your Mansion, Nancy!
And the instant she walked to the podium for her first debate,on her way there,she gave this look to the audience like,”It’s mine!”And that smirk!Then did you see her like parade setting,walking in the street and her workers were walking with her carrying ropes,had her roped off?

@politicalmablog 4)get in line behind all of those who have been waiting for YEARS! I have suspicions that those coming here have been told by the Coyotes who take thousands of dollars for each person,that they can get them across the border! So laws have to be followed until they can be changed!
@politicalmablog 3)It has taken some of my Mexican friends 10-15 years to get their Citizenship! It’s just not fair but THAT IS THE LAW!! The laws need to be changed but with all the HATE and RESISTANCE, I don’t see that happening! Those who want to come in need to apply and get in line behind
