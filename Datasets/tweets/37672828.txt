This past Thursday, #SubCommTech held a hearing to discuss the state of our media landscape. It’s important rural America is involved in these conversations to ensure equal treatment to all cable providers!
As media companies continually consolidate or attempt to consolidate, rural America’s access to broadband has the potential to diminish—increasing the digital divide. For this reason, mass media companies must be kept in check!
Vertical integration of media companies is making it harder for smaller cable providers to survive. Mass media conglomerates such as Comcast/NBCU must be reined in to preserve fair competition.
Mass media conglomerates continue to hinder market competition, especially in rural America. Today, the #SubCommTech holds a hearing on the media landscape and it’s imperative this issue be addressed.

@BrendanCarrFCC We applaud the work of the FCC to get 5G into #ruralAmerica, but urge that we continue today's #Lifeline.  Millions of low-income Americans in rural areas rely on Lifeline for phone access.  Can we have 5G and a Lifeline program that is not gutted?  #futureof5G
From job searches to health check-ins, all Americans need access to telecom @BrendanCarrFCC. #Lifeline is a vital part of the solution. Please don’t gut the program millions of rural Americans, veterans &amp; others rely on to pursue their #AmericaDream. #futureof5G @BrookingsInst
We hope members of #115thCongress don’t let today’s #NetNeutrality protests distract them from crafting bipartisan legislation that will stop the continuous back-and-forth

According to @BrendanCarrFCC, #rural America will be affected the most by regulatory relief allowing more #5G buildouts, and therefore more #broadband deployment
Anne Hazlett from @USDA talks about the @FCC’s Broadband Deployment Advisory Committee’s insights into #rural America – Thank you @AjitPaiFCC for supporting this committee so we can efficiently support closing the #DigitalDivide
“We are particularly committed at the @FCC to closing this #DigitalDivide and getting more #broadband to more Americans” - @BrendanCarrFCC Thank you for your efforts to reduce regulatory barriers on deployment

#WirelessMatters in #ruralAmerica! @AjitPaiFCC please reconsider #LifelineReforms excluding non-facilities-based providers; result=loss of Lifeline for about 70% of current consumers. #RuralAmerica benefits when there are more providers, more choices, not fewer @CatoEvents
@AjitPaiFCC please reconsider #SkinInTheGame for #Lifeline subscribers; many participants are unbanked or underbanked. Access to banking in rural areas is a challenge: of 1,980 U.S. rural counties, at least 35 counties have no bank #SaveLifeline @CatoEvents #PoliticalSpectrum

President @betsyhuber13 wraps up the State of American Communities Address. Thanks for tuning in! #150yearsofGrange
"Pull up your bootstraps, join us, the DO-ers, the Grangers, as we prepare for our next century and half of service." #150yearsofDOing
NM: "The Time to DO is now. Your community can't wait. Your nation can't wait. The world can't wait." Calls on members to say "I'm a DO-er."
Betsy Huber: "What will remain when the DO-ers are gone? Every Grange should hold the conversation of what they provide to the community"
NM: "But we are still filled with amazing members who are the backbones of our Granges...They are DO-ers."
Grange "fills gaps that would otherwise require government intervention, which always comes at a cost" -NM #150yearsofGrange
"Granges across the nation are hubs for networking, outreach &amp; innovation. We shouldn't sell ourselves short or forget our calling."
"The Grange is focusing a great deal of attention on Medicare...concern about yet another proposed budget cut to Medicare Part C" says NM
"Who will train farmers to use all the computer equipment now on tractors? Career education may be more important than ever" says NM Betsy
NM speaks on need for improved roads, bridges, waterways: "Our infrastructure is coming apart at the seams." #150yearsofGrange
"This year we sent many letters outlining farmer and rancher critical needs for reliable, high speed mobile #broadband services." –NM
“More than 20 million students are without high-speed internet access…connectivity should not stand in the way” #150yearsofGrange
"Today we need a strong advocate like the Grange supporting our farmers, our ag industry" says @betsyhuber13 #150yearsofGrange
NM: "Scientific and tech advancements continue to give our producers tools to survive in competitive markets and feed the world's hungry"
"The landscape of food and ag is rapidly changing and we will continue to fight for all producers." -NM Betsy
Betsy: "There is nowhere but in rural America that we would rather live, work, raise our family or leave our legacy" #150yearsofGrange
NM: "You'll make your decisions on policies truly born at the grassroots system...to become the policy we will advocate for on Capitol Hill"
NM announces next year's Quilt &amp; Craft Expo as "thread of the Grange...to create the beautiful American quilt" #150yearsofGrange
President Betsy Huber: "I see opportunity. An opportunity to remind our communities...of who we are" #150yearsofGrange
