@David_J_Bier David is pretending his open borders stance was ever a part of the tea party platform. No one other than his Koch overlords believed that.
@RepThomasMassie @justinamash I love you Tommy, but the burden is on you to explain how a president using power granted by Congress is in violation of the Constitution.
@justinamash This is a strawman. I don't expect you to blindly follow a president. I just wish you understood the Constitution that you speak about so much.
@icebergslim1047 @realDonaldTrump What did Obama for Otto?
@normative @chrislhayes Or Cohen is lying. If a man obsessed with winning thought he couldn't win he wouldn't voluntarily join the contest.
@MaxBoot We can give him credit for not making shit up I suppose. Not sure how that lends credibility.
@RepScottPerry @RepPeterDeFazio @TransportGOP Maybe after he outlaws the aviation industry he can ski to DC to hold hearings on eliminating other industries that hire Americans.
@Redistrict Oh okay. All Americans that had shitty bosses won't look at her and see that shitty boss. They will actually want to vote for that boss!
@David_J_Bier The type that specifically has not stopped smugglers as you just admitted in your tweet? That fencing? Keep polishing those Koch turds.
@David_J_Bier Google vehicular fencing and then laugh heartily at poor David spending his time polishing Koch Brothers turds.
@BillKristol This will make a big splash in The Weekly Standard! Oh wait...
@CharlesPPierce Focus more on the shit that supports my viewpoint and biases!
@RyanAFournier Just from a math perspective this is an awful take. Like really bad.
@BillKristol I love that Dems are going right off the cliff with you learning nothing from your snake oil to the GOP about Iraq.
@RepSwalwell @realDonaldTrump If the Senate doesn't pass it will you nuke them?
Underlying the money in politics debate is the premise from politicians that they can't be trusted to avoid bribery.
Northam was in the Klan hood or he would have said otherwise.
@fleetadmiralj It is so simple. Believe me. You just have to cut the right deal.
@owillis The left's version of letting Mexico pay for it.
@priya_ebooks This is a great cry for getting men to hate men the way feminists hate men.
@RBhic @priya_ebooks Breaking news: women want more attention and admiration and spin that as somehow an obligation of men.

@dbongino Ain't no fight to be seen chief
@realDonaldTrump If Trump had basically not tried at all he could have received exactly the same as.he did here. Good job! Good effort!
@realDonaldTrump Desperately need a dislike button for this abdication of duty.
@realDonaldTrump Bless the hearts of the fools still defending this cowardice. Please free yourself and understand Trump is lost. Get to work finding a real leader. Don't defend these cuck frauds. MAGA my ass.
I hope Stone does rat on Trump now.
I am so tired of Dems winning could be Trump's 2020 slogan
Trump will get the $1 for a wall and sell it as a win
@LindseyGrahamSC Swamp creature speaks.
Maybe old lying Ted will primary him. Any conservative with a spine should consider.
When the going gets tough Trump gets going
@ChrisRBarron @NWOinPanicMode He gave up everything. No R Congressional support in three weeks. And why would they? He proved he will cave when the going gets tough.
@rolandsmartin @realDonaldTrump @SpeakerPelosi Just the end of the country. You won, Don!
@MarkSKrikorian What happens in three weeks? The exact same thing you just saw.
@ForecasterEnten Whiz Kid is correct. Beta knows beta

WANTED: Donald Trump's spine. If found please contact 'Murica.

Trump makes the best deals for Dems
Trump just sold out completely. The search for a real change agent commences.
@ForecasterEnten The Whiz Kid speaks
@RMConservative They are hell bent on electing Dems so they can outlaw groups like the Kochs from participating in the electoral process. They are playing 5D chess.
The Koch brothers will help the Dems get elected so those Dems can outlaw the Kochs from participating in the process and tax them into oblivion. Good.
@JoyceWhiteVance So could 7 Democrat senators
@brianstelter Dear Diary
@davemeltzerWON Did Roman?
@kevinrschultz @jayrosen_nyu @chrislhayes Nothing says freedom like government news.
@ForecasterEnten Does anyone in a crowded field have a higher chance than Bernie?
Poll asks if you want free health care and majority do. Tell that majority it isn't actually free and support drops dramatically.
@fleetadmiralj Why? R's had 51 to build a wall for two years. They had 51 in December to fund the wall after the House passed it. No one cared.
@daveweigel Give von Trier Thanos
RT @RMConservative: Will not a single person in the media ask the sponsor of the King resolution of disapproval if they regret meeting with…
@TheRickWilson He would be right that R's didn't support a wall though. They had two years to help him and would not.
If President Obama has the power to legalize millions of illegal immigrants through exec action (DACA/DAPA) then doesn't Trump have similar authority to build a wall? If not, why not?
@JacobAWohl @markbjardine Trolling trolling trolling, keep those tweets coming! Raw hide!
@sjames0227 @politicalwire So are her tactics working?
@sjames0227 @politicalwire I have heard a great deal lately claiming Pelosi is a master.
@politicalwire And Pelosi's are?
@nickgillespie Or if you support property rights you support walls?
@ForecasterEnten Then she shouldn't budge. There hasn't been any recent elections where the Dem position on immigration lost nationally...
@DeeDeeMegaDooDo @haldash @ellchicago @BillKristol And how does the House have 2/3 to override?
@RMConservative Except those that want to fold.
@MaxBoot Oh Max, you made your leftist bed. Now you gotta take a nap in it.
@AOC 2010 was bigger playa
@RepJoeKennedy Obama voted for a wall. Bill Clinton endorsed and signed the bill that created the modern deportation system and his wife voted for the wall.
@AlexNowrasteh This is an odd reply. none of the R's you mention changed their position. Schumer changed his position completely and there is no explanation as to why.
@AHeilender @CNN Keep in mind the rest of the world was getting the better end of the deal without a trade war.
@CNN How is this a story? Every policy decision helps some and hurts others. When has it ever been different?
@funder Did you think Boehner was equal to Obama or nah?
@BuckSexton He doesn't stand for anything. Mystery solved.
@funder You're happy Pelosi is passing Dem bills? Isn't she some progressive Jedi master?

The wishful thinking of Romney challenging Trump in the primary was exactly the purpose of that op-ed. They think we are so dumb.
I love Dems getting their hopes up for the assorted Republican squishes hemming and hawing. They will be disappointed just as everyone counting on political cowards always is.
@RMConservative I don't get this thinking. The Pelosi ran House was disorganized and short-lived. The new CW that Pelosi is a master is fugazi.
@RMConservative The media agree with RBG so her making political statements about candidates is cool. It is only when you disagree.
@Comey They are all in agreement that you are part of the problem as well. Good on you leaving that part out.
@RepSwalwell @realDonaldTrump This guy counts a voice vote as a an actual vote by 100 senators. Who explains it to him?
@AndyRichter How about comics that have decided comedy is really just the latest vehicle to drive a political agenda.
Dems say walls won't work so don't fund one. How many government programs would they put to the same test?
@RepJoeKennedy So do you blame every president for the gun deaths during their term? How about blaming the founders because they wrote the second amendment?
Mattis is lauded as this great indispensable man. Notice there is no praise for Trump picking this supposedly God among men.
@ForecasterEnten Article says the wall hurt in the midterms but the R's that lost didn't get the wall done. They helped not act on a wall. So maybe they lost because they didn't back the prez?
@RWPUSA @realDonaldTrump @USATODAY There were 3 shutdowns
Dems and media are saying it is dumb to shutdown for the wall. If there is a cave on wall funding they will then mock Republicans as weak for caving. So take them for what they are worth.
@Chadwick_Moore @RoKeT_gal He who hath an ear let him hear.

@ourbluefuture1 @ForecasterEnten Haha! So you admit Trump did things Dem wanted but that doesn't count because...
@JayWeixelbaum @ForecasterEnten And this guy is probably center for our whiz kid
@ForecasterEnten Bumpstocks, crim justice reform, farm bill (with SNAP and no work requirement) etc...but hey whiz kid maybe you know more.
@RichLowry Perpetual war is a hell of a thing to fall on your sword for but then again somehow seems appropriate.
@LindseyGrahamSC You're scaring me
@JeffFlake Hark! Our dear leader speaks!
@ForecasterEnten Bans bumpstocks and signs criminal justice reform. Signed a liberal farm bill as well. But the "whiz kid" claims he isn't moving to the center. This is why conservatives should never even try to compromise.
@MichaelAvenatti Have you paid Trump's legal fees yet?
@JRubinBlogger So now you worry about iran but when Trump leaves iran nuclear deal you wanted to protect them.
Trump might make the Dems take up the mantle of defending perpetual occupation in the name of foreign adventurism. That's a neat trick.
@senatorshoshana What if you aren't mad?

@marclamonthill Let's give Palestine a state and let Israel attack it full force on the same day so they can go through what Israel did.
GM closes factory in US (instead of overseas) and screws workers. Media narrative is about Trump. Why is the media not taken seriously?
@tomselliott Does that mean he caused global warming right?
@philhand13 @ThePlumLineGS Unemployment is lowest it has been in decades.
@marcyrw @ThePlumLineGS Government Motors is capitalism only for those that don't know the history or don't know capitalism.
My favorite Republicans are Democrats.
@benshapiro Government Motors likely couldn't succeed even if we mandated everyone buy their cars
@ThePlumLineGS Pointing out you dancing on the graves of employees as a political win for your side is whining?
Perhaps Trump should just take taxpayer money to bribe GM to keep plants open like Obama did.
@ThePlumLineGS Count on Greg to talk about people losing jobs in context of Trump. Not even really questioning if GM is acting responsibly or how the workers are doing. Just how it helps defeat Trump. Kudos.
@David_J_Bier Difficult path of parole into the US with an EAD regardless of the frivolous nature of the claim. It isn't difficult. If it were difficult then it wouldn't be the current preferred way to get your foot in the door.
@David_J_Bier This disaster started with you wondering why we aren't as welcoming as a country that no one wants to enter. I told you it is because Colombia's imm policy doesn't have to account for the same factors, namely that everyone would come here.
@David_J_Bier Are you asking how welcoming the world to enter would lead to more people entering?
@officialmcafee Is the whale a dude or gal?
@David_J_Bier A CATO fellow should understand incentives. If everyone wants to come and you roll out the red carpet all will come. Same can't be said of Colombia. Simple.
@David_J_Bier Colombia doesn't need to worry about the global refugee population trying to enter.
@David_J_Bier Because Colombia is not the desired destination for the entire world's population?
@Ocasio2018 Please explain the process for us since you've clearly thought about this. And never you mind that the president has asked for more resources to process the surge.
@gurlbrit @AP Likely seeing the Dems talk about banning cars because of global warming. Or maybe outlawing fossil fuels would help the auto industry?
@FDRLST I liked when Schumer shit on him for being a political hack while praising him for attacking Trump  about politics in the Judiciary.

John Roberts is at least right that there aren't conservative judges.
@NateSilver538 Pundit Nate also definitively declared Trump would never win his party's nomination.
@RealSaavedra Is Obama saying he is confused, blind, and shrouded with hate?
@RMConservative There is also a maxim of international law that states someone has to pick fruit below the labor market price.

@RealKylerPost @StephenGutowski @EWErickson @RepSwalwell I wonder if you would think so if a republican tweeted it.
@StephenGutowski @RepSwalwell Nuking people is just all in good fun.
@StephenGutowski @RepSwalwell Soon as they win an election the mask slips.
@sy_beck @WalshFreedom Nuking citizens for the bill of rights isn't in the Constitution? Are you sure?
@RepSwalwell @Rambobiggs He cares about porous borders... sometimes
@iowahawkblog But he was being sarcastic though!
@sy_beck @WalshFreedom Should the government nuke people that want to defend their rights?
@RepSwalwell Swalwell would nuke his own country to take away a constitutional right. Their mask is slipping. And he's a moron on top.
@yesnicksearcy @CheetoPigeonfar @KyleThomasCA @hedgehogkibble @natejundt @RepSwalwell Well liberals assume our military is full of monsters so it is easy for them to assume those brave folks would commit mass murder against US citizens over gun confiscation.
@CheetoPigeonfar @KyleThomasCA @hedgehogkibble @natejundt @RepSwalwell Assuming the military helps the liberals that hate them to kill fellow citizens is neat.
@1badhombreDFW @WalshFreedom @RepSwalwell But he was just being sarcastic! I'm sure he has extended the same fair reading of sarcasm to president Trump...		Also he wasn't kidding. The mask slips after the election.
@sy_beck @WalshFreedom Constitution doesn't cap it
@andvamom2 @WalshFreedom @JoeWalsh Cute that people assume the military that liberals hate would kill people for them.
@RepSwalwell I can take your constitutional right and if you resist I'll nuke you! *Rimshot		Right?
@who__dat @RepSwalwell @Rambobiggs But he was just joking about mass murder. I mean come on!!!!
@RepSwalwell Narrator: he threatened nukes
@RepSwalwell @WalshFreedom I mean who amongst us hasn't joked about killing our political opponents? Amirite?
@RepSwalwell @WalshFreedom You disagree? Oh I'll nuke you! Hiroshima would get a kick out of that joke! Come on guise!
@WalshFreedom @RepSwalwell Who doesn't threaten nuclear as a gag now and then? We all recognize mass murder as the best source of sarcasm.
@RepSwalwell Citizen: I would fight to defend my constitutional rights. 		Member of Congress: lol I'll nuke U!		Why so serious?
@J_Deasy @LMJBk4awhile @RepSwalwell But now he says he didn't mean it so threatening murder was just for shits and giggles
@theDebbiePierce @LMJBk4awhile @RepSwalwell Now imagine a republican making the same threat to people that supported amnesty or some such.
@JohnJHarwood You seem Uber invested in what should be an objective investigation.
@RepSwalwell And hey, of course Swalwell thinks he didn't make any mistake. That's why he is desperate to tweet a backtrack explanation that lies about what he actually said.
@RepSwalwell Why would I be called a tyrant for threatening to nuke you? In his defense, he is actually a mass murderer not a tyrant because you won't have to live under his tyranny. You'll be dead. Politifact will score him as half right.
@RepSwalwell A member of the United States Congress "sarcastically" mentions the possibility of nuclear war on US citizens and I guarantee zero mainstream press will even mention it. Oh well. Never forget.
@RepSwalwell Oh I just "sarcastically" pointed out I would nuke you and your family. Lol! Lulz! And I provide the same fair reading to Trump tweets totally ...
@RepSwalwell No one is threatening that except you
RT @realPolitiDiva: Retweet if you think @RepSwalwell should delete his account #Retweet
@RepSwalwell "I threatened to nuke you and you totally got all dramatic. I mean gosh! Lol."
@RepSwalwell You threatened to drop nuclear weapons on opponents. Don't blame you for leaving that out but it did happen and is key to the criticism you are receiving.
@funder Did you even review her actual record as speaker? Boehner and Cantor destroyed her. They had the most successful motions to recommit in the modern era. And then she presided over the biggest obliteration of a Dem majority in years.
@CalebJHull @LaughandScrap Other politicians are excoriated for much less than advocating mass murder on Twitter.
@ChuckGrassley @realDonaldTrump Release all dangerous felons! The Purge Act of 2018!
@SoylentMerchant @shadyponcho But don't be so dramatic about me threatening to murder you bro!
@RepSwalwell No lie. Blithely threatening nuclear war to opponents should warrant a censure. House Ethics Committee should look into this.
@RepSwalwell And listen to him or he will advocate nuking you. No seriously ...
@RepSwalwell You threatened nuclear war because people want to exercise their constitutional right. So the dramatic tag rests solely with you. Own it. This should stick with you for a while.
@NeoUnrealist @RepSwalwell @Rambobiggs Who could ever enforce immigration law??? But hey I will confiscate all guns easy or I will nuke you! Check Eric tweets when Trump talked about fire and fury.
@RepSwalwell @Rambobiggs So you threatening nuclear war for protecting a constitutional right is not "dramatic"? And I'm sure you haven't been dramatic about Trump tweets....
@RepSwalwell @Catheri71000729 @Rambobiggs Sooooo much civility.
@funder @sethmoulton @TimRyan @RepSchrader @RepPerlmutter @RepBillFoster Did she lead the charge to lose seats in 2010 and 2014 too or is that not her fault?

@ChuckGrassley With Sessions gone you should be able to release as many dangerous felons as you want! Huzzah!
@RMConservative Conservative Judicial Supremacy is still judicial supremacy.
@MichaelAvenatti Mueller must love being grouped in with you!
@David_J_Bier @gsiskind Increase in denials could also be because for decades the laws Congress already passed were not enforced.
Who is funding this revisionist history where Pelosi was a master Speaker? Her short tenure was largely a disaster and ended with a massive wave sweeping her party into oblivion.
@jwgop @EAChrisMiller And what a face it will be...
@jwgop She presided over more successful minority motions to recommit of any Speaker in the modern era. She couldn't control her conference on things like the big bank bailout and nearly blew Obamacare. What are you talking about?
Sooooo in the Dem vote for Speaker can everybody vote? Will you have to prove your identity as a member? Will Broward count?
@jaketapper @DavidJUrban @kaitlancollins @JFKucinich @jrpsaki @TheLeadCNN Are we going to acknowledge that Pelosi's folks will retaliate if she wins and you run against her or nah? Just pretend no one wants to run?

@David_J_Bier @skilledimmigrn Does this hypothetical world include no other visa categories the kids could apply for like oh I don't F visas for college students? Do we also ignore that these are temporary visas and people using them to gain permanent status are doing it wrong?
@AnnCoulter Ann should be the next press secretary
@stickyfacts @irritatedwoman But people who believe in a living Constitution told me this part is set in stone...
@SteveSchmidtSES Graham is a monster of your creation brah.
@thehill The campaign ads would be legit.
@MaxBoot True conservatives vote for socialists. #1984
@amconmag I always do my best trading with people that think I'm Satan.
@JVLast If only true conservatives like Jonathan could just speak for us all and be our philosopher king.
@Just_Saki_ @RevJJackson @StrongLCarol Unless it is an Obama EO
@RevJJackson This is the type of civility and calm discourse the public is thirsting for.
@RealSaavedra If you make fun of us it is because you are secretly racist. When we make fun of you it is just because we are better than you. #liblogic
@MaxBoot How many families are too many or should it be unlimited?
@MBGlenn You are pro-life but support a party that holds the right to abortion on demand as sacred. That's like saying you are Christian but don't believe in Jesus. You do you, but it is a fundamental contradiction.
@TheRickWilson I'm sure Dems will love you now. Congrats.
@TPM Government control of people's health is terrifying
@RealSaavedra Das Boot democratic apologist
@tparti @maggieNYT He mentions DACA to make you confront the double standard of the left on executive action. FYI
@mattgaetz @Catheri71000729 @AndrewGillum That's called killing it
@stone_toss @Warsywarsy @iamtherog The real zodiac be mad
@thechrisbuskirk If only he had figured this out two years ago
@maggieNYT They did in 2016 as well. Which means he's doomed right? Or maybe they are all stupid and don't get it...can't be that
@RMConservative Isn't that voter suppression to Dems?
@benshapiro Or yours
@benshapiro Just so you know...Ben is above the fray
@benshapiro Strangle puppies with toffee
@joshtpm Politicians...seeking higher office? I've never heard of such a thing.
@lachlan @benshapiro So based on the Dem premise his "mistake" was dabbling in white supremacy.
@MZHemingway Jon Stewart wrestled John Cena. And he is messing with other people's egos?
@benshapiro This is legit. Ben thinks he's better than everyone
@RMConservative Don't even ask what is in the commerce clause
@RMConservative I want the flow chart for their constitutional positions. Constitution grants citizenship to every baby born but the same doc doesn't protect the lives of future citizens. Weird.
@PPact So Planned Parenthood believes both the Constitution provides citizenship automatically to anyone born in the US AND doesn't protect the lives of their future citizens?
@TheRickWilson Did he get hacked or is this for serious?
@terriermanUSA @trevriley @t4mtumblr @marthasjones_ Yeah China and the US are a 1-to-1 comparison.
@tribelaw OMG you're in love!
@BigSteve207 @JessicaV_CIS CNN is asking if Trump had him whacked
@realDailyWire @benshapiro But did Ben make crystal clear that he also hates Trump in the video?
Welp https://t.co/agocFVEL4y
@John_Hudson @Cernovich @agearan @griffwitte Merkel's exit is a gift to the world.
@trevriley @terriermanUSA @t4mtumblr @marthasjones_ Yep. Subject to the jurisdiction does not mean just being subject to police power. Otherwise you could just say you are a citizen if you are born here. It means more than that.
@NateSilver538 They don't really want Steve King polling because it will burst their bubble
@RoyBeck_NUSA @JessicaV_CIS Liberals are divided on how to advance their open border agenda on this issue. Give them a couple of days and they will remember just to call it racist.
@izzybugatti @joanwalsh We found something true a Clinton said! This is a landmark
@elskemccain @Cernovich Rehire Roseanne next I suppose
@JoyAnnReid Were you hacked here or nah?
@JRubinBlogger Rubin is now telling you who are the "right" type of jews who can speak.
@PoliticalShort But THIS time is the time
@FAIRImmigration Mark just wants to know when we can officially give them.amnesty.
@ABC ABC GOTV for Dems is really inspiring
@LindseyGrahamSC @SebGorka It would take a detailed flow chart to map out your immigration position. But I am at the end of it letting everyone know you are for amnesty.
@RuthMarcus @MaxBoot Good thing that is now settled!
@BernieSanders What about dividing us by class?
@JonahNRO Oh Jonah, I wish the dog tweets were the most innocuous thing you did.
@RealMattCouch @Catheri71000729 They just want to do a bonfire
@JoeySmoey5 @JonahNRO But it doesn't just say you must be born here. The issue is what does "subject to the jurisdiction thereof" means. That is the kicker here. It has to mean more than just being born here otherwise why would it need to be said?
@JoeySmoey5 @JonahNRO Well I agree with you. The EO is a step towards the courts defining what the citizenship clause means. But it wasn't improper to do an EO in this circumstance no matter your policy preference.
@seahawkshuskies @ezraklein Life is always fragile and you can't fix that. That's the story of us.
@RealMattCouch @Catheri71000729 To be fair, invading the US is a job Americans won't do.
@CNN Yeah let's protest a solemn paying of respects. That will add more much needed civility.
@seahawkshuskies @ezraklein Of course humans are not immune from the same factors that affect other life on the planet. We are not special.
@JoeySmoey5 @JonahNRO Jonah is not extremely right leaning to anyone other than liberals.
@benshapiro I want to know if she can have an open relationship so she can also sleep with her lawn mower.
@KSNNews @daveweigel What Kansas needs is a liberal to finally unleash the secret socialists all across Kansas.
@NateSilver538 Ah yes the gold standards...
@RMConservative Clarify how borders are constitutional because I'm confused.
@JoeySmoey5 @JonahNRO Of course you acknowledge no court or Congress have ever acted on automatic birthright citizenship for illegal immigrants? The current policy is just executive policy. Why couldn't it change by executive action?
@chrislhayes @JuddLegum Steve King will be doomed in his New York district...oh wait.
@TheRickWilson @JacobAWohl Mueller in his patriarchy power position could swat victims away. Yes indeed. Hooray!
MeToo eating the liberal hope of Mueller would be the most delicious of all timelines.
@ThomasEWoods @hhoover314 Why can't he speak for and condemn all of us? Seems legit.
@nytopinion #iambored
@JoeySmoey5 @JonahNRO Yes sir! Send a link to the Washington Post THAT will convince everyone. The press is so persuasive.
@Gary_222 @JonahNRO It is only outdated where it disagrees with their current policy preferences
@JonahNRO I always go to the Washington Post for constitutional scholarship because they are always so worried about that document and not their political views...
@IngrahamAngle The left is just defending the republic.
@seahawkshuskies @ezraklein Or maybe...maybe...the ecosystem itself is thinning the herd? More numbers does not mean better life for the animals you know?
@CNN Animal rights activists still hate the US way more so China has that going for them.
@Ohio_Buckeye_US @lipstickpundit1 Just the price of cheap labor.
@ForecasterEnten Well the forecast is definitely what I depend on for accurate results.
@ezraklein Oh no! What would I do without 60 percent more giraffes!
@ForecasterEnten Harry killing it with the unfalsifiable claims
@antonejohnson @MaxBoot Das Boot is my copilot!
@zachheltzel Good to see the civility returning
@timmal510 @HuffPost Hell yeah! Paul Ryan courting the constituency that matters.
@JMcfeels @Warsywarsy @SpeakerRyan Paul Ryan lost his home state in 2012 because the media called him a fascist. Maybe now they will forgive him
@ForecasterEnten When you do something valuable to the economy you will have that kind of $$$$, Harry. Until then...
@HuffPost But HuffPo thinks Ryan is scum right? Now he's legit I suppose.
@NRO @jackrcrowe Steve Stivers is our moral conscience apparently even though I've never seen him take one stand before today.
@PrisonPlanet @Warsywarsy #believewomensupportingmypoliticalstances
@kerpen @irritatedwoman Well I mean the Mueller stuff seems politically motiv...well I mean it is awfully politically conv...well...you're sexist.
@DailyCaller #believesomewomen
@benshapiro Love is supernatural
@AnnCoulter Jake Tapper, immigration expert
@JuddLegum @TysonFoods Only give money to people Judd Legum supports and you'll be safe brah.
@RMConservative But what about the constitutional provision covering virtue signaling
@AlexNowrasteh Hahahahahahaha....*breathe*....ahahahahahahaha!!!!
@DavidAFrench Tell us the law to apply.
@JoshMBlackman Well then everyone born here would be subject to jurisdiction under this reading. That makes it unnecessary to when state it
@jorgeRfragoso @DavidAFrench Way to come through in the clutch. Now what does "subject to the jurisdiction thereof" mean?
Well that doesn't support the narrative https://t.co/NIHVwHlQ3Y
@JRubinBlogger Shhhhhh everyone! My prophet has returned from the mountaintop with more wisdom to share.
@DavidAFrench Release the virtue signaling
@DavidAFrench Under what scotus opinion or congressional law is automatic birthright citizenship granted currently? Spoiler, none. Which means the president can right now clarify executive practice. Congress and courts can stop him. But he can do it
@justinamash Neither can you amend the Constitution with a tweet. SCOTUS has not interpreted the Constitution the way you claim. Congress has passed no law granting automatic birthright citizenship. So auto birthright has always been an executive policy nothing more.
@wophugus @mattyglesias Subject to jurisdiction, again, means more than simple police power. Your assertion is that the 14th amendment simply says the same thing twice (essentially that subject to police power is all that is required).
@wophugus @mattyglesias It means they are here in defiance of our jurisdiction as opposed to subject to it.
@CHAUVINISMbrand @MarkSKrikorian @RameshPonnuru Agreed. Setting up some system where you both get rewarded for breaking the law and even further reward if you break it for 10 years is lunacy and will only lead to more lawlessness.
@wophugus @mattyglesias An illegal immigrant only is in the US because of a failure to catch and remove them. They are here in defiance of law and the US doesn't even know they are here in many cases.
@CHAUVINISMbrand @MarkSKrikorian @RameshPonnuru Actually I believe after a set number of years illegal immigrants can ask for cancellation of removal (10 I believe) which is why we need an INA scrub.
@wophugus @mattyglesias But you take the same principle of the framers of the 14th and apply it to today. The United States cannot police those that enter without consent. And if they could they would bar them from entering.
@NormEisen Crucial "..." there
@MarkSKrikorian @RameshPonnuru I mean you eliminate incentive to self deport when the goal would be to run out the 10 year clock. Eliminate the middle man and say no one can unilaterally produce citizens in defiance of the very jurisdiction they claim to be subject to.
@RMConservative But compassion and jobs Americans won't do and mowing lawns and paying under the table and have a heart!
@MarkSKrikorian @RameshPonnuru So you think the best policy is not only to reward illegal immigration but provide incentive for none of them to leave for 10 years? Glad you aren't in the admin.
@wophugus @mattyglesias Well of course just examine why ambassadors are excluded. Loyalty to another sovereign which applies to tribes and all those who enter the US illegally.
@JamilSmith @KirstenPowers No court or Congress have ever mandated automatic birthright citizenship for non-citizens. Did anyone know that this is basically an executive policy to begin with to pass out citizenship like candy?
@wophugus @mattyglesias I think it means, at minimum, a reciprocal obligation between person and government. Otherwise an invading army could theoretically birth citizens of the US while occupying US soil. And any place the US occupied would also be subject to the jurisdiction.
@StevenTDennis I don't really care for politicians doing what they say. Voters might start expecting all of us to keep our word.
@MarkSKrikorian @RMConservative What about an invading army? Would soldiers invading US soil be able to birth citizens?
@wophugus @mattyglesias Being subject to jurisdiction means something different than simple being subject to police power. Otherwise the 14th amendment is redundant.
@dannydombrowsky @EsotericCD Of course an executive order works if birthright is policy only because the executive branch allows it. Neither Congress nor Courts have mandated automatic birthright citizenship.
@wophugus @mattyglesias So you contend the 14th Amendment clearly states someone could enter the United States in defiance of laws duly enacted and that unlawful act would reward the person with the ability to produce citizens automatically?
@marthasjones_ The reason it can be done with an EO is because Congress doesn't have laws mandating birthright citizenship automatically. This is just policy decisions by the executive up to this point.
@realDonaldTrump @DaveBratVA7th But I liked Eric Cantor. The way he sold out conservatives at every turn was almost erotic, Mr. President.
@Feisty_FL @AppSame If "subject to the jurisdiction thereof" means anything at all and wasn't just fluff then it means you cannot enter the US illegally and then grant citizenship to your progeny unilaterally.
@mattyglesias Well if Canada does it then that is enough for me!
@mattyglesias But the Constitution doesn't mandate birthright citizenship. The argument is whether "subject to the jurisdiction thereof" means anything.
@EsotericCD But wait, it is also not contradictory to believe birthright is bad policy AND can be undone by change in policy.
Retweeted to own the libs https://t.co/qVRBaL5X82
@TaylorLorenz @JeffreyGoldberg Also quick Q, should I retweet this to get your viewpoint noticed?
@TaylorLorenz @JeffreyGoldberg Delete any functionality that might support viewpoints or people I don't agree with!
@JuddLegum @ABABankers Don't you want to stop them from giving money to anyone?
@ahumorlessfem @MalcolmNance Then Mexico is in trouble
@BuckSexton @betseyross But that's different because we didn't like kavanaugh. Duh
@passantino Let's let them all in so we can get our crappy labor jobs filled at lower than market value!
@TheAtlantic @JeffreyGoldberg @julianzelizer It is almost as if any support for borders leads to all bad things. This reporter could be on to something.
@spectatorindex @benshapiro I can't believe a centrist moderate serious person would fold when the going got tough.
@benshapiro Doesn't she think Russia runs the US now or did Mueller give up on that theory?
Let's build a Wal-Mart on the border instead! #squishthoughts
@MaxBoot Who wouldn't pay to hear what they already believe? Plenty of candidates have done that with Max for years.
@NateSilver538 Saved me a click
@keith___m @NateSilver538 Well the magical formula is Dem policies AND Dem candidates.
@benshapiro Bernie pointed out we killed millions, dude.
@DrewWhiteTX @RMConservative Harmony is expensive
@TracyAChambers @DailyCaller This would shake the foundation of my trust in what the media tells me therefore fake news
@RMConservative Well if both sides agreed it can't be wrong. Bipartisanship never leads to anything but harmony.
@MarkSKrikorian You clearly haven't read the Constitution where it says someone must mow my lawn for next to nothing.
If scummy Trump voters can't get over their inbred ignorance to be civil we should ignore them and elect their betters!
@NateSilver538 If only R's had listened to me and nominated Dems we would be killing it right now.
@benshapiro @TracyAChambers But the Bernie bro was only violent because Trump won. If we return to the squish strategy of losing elections none of this happens.
@owillis I agree Oliver. I tell Republicans we need to just be Democrats and unite the country but they aren't patriotic enough.
@MaxBoot Sad!
@Evan_McMullin Praise Allah that you have escaped the mind shaping powers of Trump, Evan! What would we do without you?
@AirTalk @MaxBoot Max Boot is so right. I too trace the decline of the Republican Party with it's move away from listening to me.
@JessicaV_CIS They can't come as a caravan if we fly them up here. #checkmate
I vote civil socialism over uncouth capitalism every time!
@SpeakerBoehner @RepShelley So long as there isn't principle stands for all...
@BrentBozell As if we need goading!
To be fair to the President, running scared from our enemies is a new strategy. It could work!
In my defense, have you ever been the center of attention at an elite DC cocktail party?
If a Democrat needs a soft landing I'm waiting to chuck conservatives underneath them.
I'm fine with Spitzer and Weiner in politics. Last thing I want is personal integrity considered a requirement.
Checks and balances are sooooooo 18th century.
I'm happy to nuke the filibuster. Any demonstration of principle makes me look bad.
When I betray my party it is only because I think it is expedient to my self interest. It isn't because I have any liberal principles!
The Republican Establishment just can't quit me!
I understand Dwight Howard's tentativeness on selecting a team...
I may be a squishy moderate, but Jesus did say the meek shall inherit the Earth so I have that going for me.
@Paratisi Never underestimate how hard it is to take a stand when you don't believe in anything.
It is only by losing that we learn to win. Keep nominating RINOs cuz we've almost got this winning thing figured out.
None of the Obama scandals can be that big of a deal because my liberal friends are so snidely defensive about them.
@GOPrincess @JohnFromCranber Let's just make July 4th tax day and bring people together! #compromise
I swear fealty to the Big Tent so long as we can keep the Tea Party out of it. #RepubRebrand
I support Obama's foreign policy of capitulation because it has always worked so well for me with Democrats at home.
@AnnDuval1 @irritatedwoman He put the "compassion" into conservatism! Nothing says compassion like crippling recession.
@mik5andynothem @Paratisi @marcorubio But he might get a couple extra % of the Latino vote! What is enforcing the law compared to that coup?
@JohnGaltTx @AzulayRomond But those are government approved folks, sir! When has giving gov all the guns ever gone wrong?
I will manage the government takeover of the energy industry with more prudence. #RepubRebrand
Before every vote I think to myself, "What would David Brooks do?"
Expanding liberal central planning programs since 1952. #RepubRebrand
Speaking of responsible. Nothing says responsible like ignoring the 2nd Amendment, amirite? #Constitutionisold
@AllegedlySane @GregWHoward All right and decent people at my cocktail parties agree. We have to do this!
Asking for a friend, federalism is when the President tells a state they don't have to do something because he will just do it for them?
I'm always here to tell you why Republicans are wrong. #MSNBCcoverletterexceprts
Don't let the fact that I consistently lose elections shake your confidence in my electability.
Reaching across the aisle is an end in and of itself no matter what you end up reaching around.
