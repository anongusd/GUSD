@Michaelmrw The heads of these agencies were appointed by Trump. They're Republicans. So when the Republican heads of every single security agency we hold dear call out their boss for bullsh*t. It's scary as hell. Maybe if it was one or 2 agencies, but it's all of them.

@TheLibertyLamp AoC is only 29. She can't run for president at that age.
@TheLibertyLamp Hillary Clinton was named by Americans as the woman they admire most for well over 17 years. She was even polling at a 62 percent favorability with Republicans before they started they rolled out their anti-Hillary war machine.
