@Dax_x98 I'm right there with all you ladies who said Donnie Osmond, Bobby Sherman and David Cassidy. Leif Garrett was pretty cute, too, and he went to my Jr. High. But my #1 guy was Mike Nesmith. https://t.co/JkZu7FS14x
@HoarseWisperer I keep multiples around for just such a challenge. Toby the dog and Grandpa Max entertain the foster kittens. https://t.co/AMimOWoZUK
@GeminiElise @JeremyPress1 @HoarseWisperer I also have a Toby. He is not really a fan of cats, but they are always a fan of him. He is a good sport with my foster kittens. https://t.co/bsxSIXdqGH
@BriereBear Thank God for my last kid at home. Next year will be brutal.
@KatFucksUp Also, depends on deductions. I didn't ever get $5K, but filing head of household, home office deductions, etc. did help out. I lost a few hundred this year. Next year will be brutal when the last kid moves out.
@videocats OMgod! So cute.
@ImJohnEli A tramp stamp?
@MyCatADemocrat @deartoni70 Yeah, I know there will always be outliers. I just feel like there was payoff to being moderate 40 years ago. And the corporate machine was not as firmly established. People were more in touch with facts and alternative facts weren't as readily available before the interwebs.
Wow! Imagine the guts to just tell congress ... nah, I'm good. Like, my job is national security and this is the hot button topic of the day, but no. Just no. https://t.co/bhTyoDc4b4
There was support for Nixon until there wasn't. I would like to believe that we could move on from difficult realizations about Trump, were they to be revealed. Truth, justice and liberty were far greater values back then, though. With Social Media, there might be no coming back.
I just want an 8 hour work day, like back in the good ol' days. A robot will not take my job because I program the robots, but they sure did change what productivity looks like.
@AngryBlackLady I'm sorry, I'm actually laughing because I didn't understand this. I'm not edgy, I'm old. Oh my goodness! ü§£
@mos_daf I remember taking the grandkids to the Civic Rights Museum in Memphis. Heavy. I couldn't stop crying. They said, "You okay, Grandma?" No, honey. No, I really wasn't. I don't understand mistaking ignorance for innocence. Not in my house.
@mos_daf My poor clear white kid w/ bright red hair had his own issues, but he was raised to value people based on merits, not skin tone. His godmother is black, married to a Mexican, &amp; his babysitter was from Sri Lanka. His default was just fine, but I hear ya about what you don't know.

@kyjimbo51 @kurteichenwald @Mayzee590 I occasionally do, too. Not because I need to get "both sides of the story." It's to understand what the followers are going on about now when they are spouting absurb talking points. I will say, Fox News does have real news.

@beth_george44 @shirlgirl11 @realDonaldTrump I saw mine today. I'm so tired of winning. I need a very long nap.
@duckwithaboner @Little_Raven89 @sadieC137 @theycallmevince @Wayhath2 @owenawhaley @itsgabrielleu No, I just did mention it. Gender shouldn't be a factor in sentencing either way. The original point of the post, though, was that a poor woman of color was given a much harsher sentence for defending herself than a rich white guy received for a heinous crime.
@duckwithaboner @Little_Raven89 @sadieC137 @theycallmevince @Wayhath2 @owenawhaley @itsgabrielleu It really is a shame in this day and age that race and gender do influence so many things, but they do. Sentencing is definitely still one of them. But money is probably the most deciding factor in all 3 cases mentioned here.

@LoriTriesLife You may DM me. I am referring to the princes, rock stars, and actors of the world who just want to friend ME for conversation. LOL!
This never gets old. The kittens are starting to behave like cats. They are judging me. They have pointy little ears. They walk, unsteadily. They are starting to climb. They are learning to pounce, although they rarely get their mark. They purr when they see me. #FosterKittens https://t.co/wcV2INCRzT
@LoriTriesLife And I want to add: I am not an anxious person. I'm a programmer. Logic makes more sense than emotional excess. Damage control is my super power. So for me to feel anxiety, to yell at the TV, to avoid other humans, to seek therapy ... it's really saying something. Not a fan!

@advisorrob @DanRather I'm personally not at risk (except air quality), but friends and loved ones have lost their homes, been terrified, and inconvenienced. This picture was me walking the dog on Friday night. https://t.co/l0Sjs2wIdw
@advisorrob @DanRather However, as the weather has changed significantly (severe draught) at the same time that funding for research and maintenance was cut. Well, you can see the problem. Were mistakes made? Probably, but a lot of this is uncharted territory.
@advisorrob @DanRather I live here. In the SoCal fires, there is no forest. CA chaparral is actually designed to burn so our populous area has always been risky. This reason that 250,000 had to evacuate is because this is city, not forest. We have always had fires. We always had strategies.
Those daredevils! ü§£ https://t.co/3VBCRUx7ed
LOL, I need to get back to work at my well paying job. ü§£I get pretty carried away to write something that 5 people will read. I just wish there was a uniting voice. We want the same things! We want love, prosperity, liberty, good health. We want opportunity! ‚òÆÔ∏è‚ù§Ô∏è/end
Large corporations are controlling the narrative, making you think government is taxing the job creators. Small businesses are the real job creators and the opportunity for the America we used to know, where working hard was enough to prosper. /11
GREED! Lack of opportunity for those willing to work and to pull themselves up by their bootstraps. An illegal NEVER stole MY job, because my employer would never hire someone without documentation. If illegals are stealing your jobs, you must look at employers FIRST! /10
Those programs should be designed like the one I used, to build better citizens. Increase the earning potential for the poor and you increase income tax and sales tax revenue. This is the CURE. Demonizing certain people, like POC or immigrants, ignores the real problem. /9
I used to say that charity shouldn't come from government. I used to say it should come from individuals, churches or non-profits. I still believe it that but the problem is too big to address from that alone. We are a civilized society. We should help our poor and vulnerable. /8
This is the goal of the "socialists" here in CA. We truly want to provide a hand up, not a hand out. Sure, some people will abuse the system. That doesn't mean we shouldn't help our citizens pull themselves up. I more than paid back the good tax payers by becoming one. /7
Almost 40 years later, I pay A LOT of taxes. I am also a consumer. I buy way more junk than I need. ü§ëI was also able to save money for my kids, so I broke the cycle. I grew up poor but they did not. We are not rich, but we're self-supporting. /6
When I was 16, I was trained by a state employment program. Tax credits were given to companies willing to hire/train us. I had a pretty good job at 16. It was more than min wage and barely enough to live. There was a cost to my government, but I became a skilled worker. /5
But it also takes away jobs. It is a huge problem and it needs to be addressed. The best solution is better training and better education, because there are still skilled jobs. Someone needs to train the robots. Not everyone will go to college. We need training programs. /4
Why? Entry level jobs are not as available because of automation. We have more supermarkets w/o cashiers, more ATM's, more food service w/o cashiers, etc. Many warehouse jobs are done by robots. QC done w/ computers. Yes, this is progress. It lowers costs for corporations. /3
For example, I live in Los Angeles. We have a large immigrant population, both legal and illegal. I live in a poor neighborhood. No illegal has ever stolen my job, but they are usually hard working and support their families. Many of the poor Americans do not work as hard. /2
I don't support Trump because I think his divisiveness is the most harmful thing a modern president has ever done. I don't like a lot of his policies either but we have always had to live through political differences. We always survive those differences. /1 #MondayMotivaton
@KassandraSeven @Bellatrixx2020 @TrumpsTaxes @espyforsenate A lot are "racist lite." Probably don't hate anyone just 4 breathing, but don't want "them" marrying their kid, being their boss, living next door, etc. Still racism. Probably more dangerous because acceptable to many. When they deny, they just mean they're not burning crosses.
@Kikipedia2 @ShawnaGrafton @PejutaTasunka @Thms80 @Laureninlex @h__krause @NicholasStix @SRuhle I was referring to illegal immigrants, but Twitter does limit characters.
@ShawnaGrafton @PejutaTasunka @Thms80 @Laureninlex @h__krause @NicholasStix @SRuhle An immigrant has never taken my job bc my employer only hires legal workers. Why be mad at immigrants if ur employer is willing to break the law? Automation OTOH has taken jobs &amp; made mine harder. Also moving jobs to MX or overseas. That's not immigrants, that's corp profits.

@OmShivaJanice @Dax_x98 You are right. And I certainly wasn't trying to downplay the OP. I just want to have hope. Some followers do actually resemble Jesus.

Just learned of a friend who lost her home in #WoolseyFire. She was one of many people who helped me 19+ years ago when I was a single mom w/ a preemie baby &amp; no job. These are humans, friends ... not political tools. She lost 1000's of books, her passion, but her family is safe.

@KayCee4TN I have acknowledged that it is impossible to know for sure, but he acted like every abusive guy I've ever known, alternating yelling, crying, blaming ... and she looks scared. I'm not a Democrat, btw. Just a concerned citizen.
@KayCee4TN I did see this and it does raise doubt, but it doesn't prove anything either. I had good times with my ex-husband and there are pictures where I look happy and at ease. For her sake and our country, I do hope you are right and I am wrong.
@KayCee4TN There is no doubt that it made it worse, but I'm not sure it is the only cause. Again, I say this from watching him with my own eyes, not listening to what the media said about it. I watched every minute of the process, before accusations thru swearing in.
@siano2020 I fall on the cusp of Baby Boomer/Gen X. One thing I can assure you ... even though we were probably taught more civics back in the day, every generation has been apathetic when they were young. As a punk rocker, we rebelled loudly but we didn't fix it. How can we fix this?

Okay, everyone is up in arms about witches "putting a hex on" the GOP. LOL. This isn't any different than Republicans "praying" for victory over the left. It is the microcosm (individual) putting energy into the macrocosm (universe). It can be done with love or fear. CHOOSE LOVE!
@KayCee4TN @crazycatlover59 @TCUGrenouille @power2she @timpmermans @IndivisibleNet I supported Kavanaugh until his own testimony made me think he was too emotional for the job.

@KayCee4TN @crazycatlover59 @TCUGrenouille @power2she @timpmermans @IndivisibleNet Honestly, it could be either one. As a person who escaped an abusive relationship I can tell you that this IS spot on for how she would act. What makes it compelling to imagine abuse instead of your take is that his touch does not seem very loving.

@MrDane1982 I've seen it, too, even well meaning folks. My sister married a black man &amp; our poor, white trash family got a big upgrade! We have in-laws who are professionals, entertainers, athletes. I freakin' love holidays together! Of course, a couple are republican so no one's perfect. ü§™
@LAVining My stress level would be lessened by those actions, though. LOL! A broken clock is right twice a day.
@fallenstargh He should apologize for his grammar, too. What an idiot!
@LAVining A middle eastern guy encouraging people to renounce their riches &amp; follow him wouldn't drum up support in middle America these days. It was suggested I should turn off the TV &amp; put down Twitter. I'm just suggesting they should turn off Fox News &amp; pick up the Bible. (Said w/love!)
@LAVining I was just talking about how these became Christian values. All I can think is every single thought, deed, word or action is motivated by one of two things: Love or Fear. The "machine" has them gripped with fear but may MY actions be grounded in love. Jesus didn't die for THIS!
@LAVining It's really surreal. I'm so sorry you had to re-feel these things but we are clearly not alone. This is a pervasive problem and we will overcome!
@AubreySPalumbo I think it's important to know why they didn't report. Sometimes it's to protect the victim, even if that decision is misguided. I mean, it takes courage to be violated again and again by the process. We, as a society, are not where we need to be.
A man mocked me for saying I hoped his wife or daughter were never raped. He said I sounded crazy. Crazy? Because I don't want his family members to be violated? In case I wasn't clear: I hope you &amp; your loved ones never understand from 1st hand exp. You can still have empathy!

@purrmonsta Sorry about the kitty you lost. That's really hard, too, but you gave her a good life. XO
@purrmonsta It can be really hard. I have 4 permanent cats (1, a foster fail). I'm very careful of where they go when placed but it's still heartbreaking. The alternative is more heartbreaking, though. Gotta save them all.
@rammac133 It's funny that you say that because I feel less brave than usual. But thank you.
@SandaYama Yes, you may. I have 3 sons, it's a hard thing to say. If they were falsely accused, I would push for and cooperate with an investigation immediately. I wouldn't want them presumed guilty of assault; I wouldn't want the accuser presumed guilty of lying either.

This is why women stay silent. This is why I don't trust politicians. If you disagree with this, I hope you never had the experiences that I had that make me feel this way. I hope you wife, mother, daughter, sister, or friend is never sexually assaulted. #Kavanaugh #Survivor
This should not have been a partisan issue. Women should always been heard &amp; respected. Men should always be entitled to a fair hearing. IF it came out that someone was lying to take someone down, by all means, there should be consequences. We didn't have to start there.
I told them I am upset re the process more than the outcome. Millions of women have been re-violated over &amp; over thru this process. I said, "Better a son falsely accused &amp; cleared thru investigation than a daughter assaulted &amp; not believed." I expected push back but THEY AGREED!
I have to post on Twitter bc I cannot talk to my friends. I cannot bear to see my friends' idiotic posts on FB. I need to vent somewhere. I LITERALLY started therapy yesterday &amp; my sons have learned more about my childhood &amp; youth than any man should have to know about his mom.

This is the only thing that makes any sense to me at all right now. I started therapy yesterday and I'm going to try to fix the hurts from 40 years ago. But what about the rape survivors who don't have my support circle? Or my mental health insurance benefits? #therapy #kitten https://t.co/SNqBEz57aZ
@krassenstein @TerryAnn1219 Well, I've never felt like this b4. I dusted off the "C" word for this occasion. My heart hurts. My soul is tired. I'm scared for our country &amp; for my children &amp; grandchildren. I started therapy yesterday but what about those w/o access to mental health svcs?
@Comey @degs62uk I was no fan of Reagan. I was 17 when he was elected and couldn't weigh in. But I do miss someone who spoke coherently and at least appeared to be congenial. By today's standards, Reagan would be a moderate. Let that sink in.

@jamielynncrofts I foster as often as I can. Olivia is one of my foster fails. This was her 3 years ago with Grandpa Max. He's my grown cat with sense and reason. He plays with them, bathes them, and teaches them cat things. How quickly she forgot! ü§£ https://t.co/ZJuQq1qfSa

@Youre2Deluded @RepAdamSchiff As a moderate, he was too conservative for my tastes, but I didn't think he was a bad choice. I didn't change my mind until I watched HIS testimony. I have been falsely accused &amp; spent time in jail for it, so I understand his outrage. I still think his demeanor is disqualifying.
@Youre2Deluded @RepAdamSchiff I don't think this is criticizing the FBI. I think this is criticizing the process. This whole ridiculous exercise has been exploited politically by both sides. NO ONE has meant to cooperate. The fix IS in. And I literally need therapy now.
This is why I don't go to church.  Told the pastor I was upset about Republican Jesus. He asked, "What about Democrat Jesus? He's worse!" His wife added, "There is no Democrat Jesus. They don't believe in God." I haven't been back since. Jesus and I no longer feel welcome. https://t.co/L20jx4Yy5v
@SandDollar04 @krassenstein @ChelseaClinton This is true. But we're better than him. We don't have to act like him. There is plenty of material without bringing the kids into it.
@RonboSandanista @Birdieblue1 @IdgiPeter @realDonaldTrump But how does that justify your stance that moderates are spineless? Just because you try to bridge the gaps between the sides doesn't mean you lack courage. It means you lack malice. You lack superiority. Both sides want the same thing: Happiness, good health, love, prosperity.
@RonboSandanista @Birdieblue1 @IdgiPeter @realDonaldTrump Certainly NOT the Republicans or Donald Trump. The Constitution and the Bill of Rights are the basis for all other rights that might be afforded or conferred by federal, state, and local laws. And I'm a moderate. I am a fan of liberty, smaller government, and live and let live.
@RonboSandanista @Birdieblue1 @IdgiPeter @realDonaldTrump You really think moderates are "spineless?" Wow!

@sakamakawaka @Birdieblue1 @IdgiPeter @realDonaldTrump And that is 100% how Democrats feel about Republicans. So all that happens is America is destroyed.
@BSdetector5000 @IdgiPeter @realDonaldTrump I think the only way this could get fixed if people held their own side responsible for grievances. Like parents: I cannot fix your kids, but I should fix mine. Even if yours are worse. And that's probably just an opinion anyway.
@Birdieblue1 @IdgiPeter @realDonaldTrump I'm a moderate, that's why I ask. Very frustrated that no one seems to be able to proceed without "picking a side" or to see the hypocrisy in calling out behavior that is present in both sides.
@IdgiPeter @realDonaldTrump I can understand this sentiment. Tired of division. Do you believe it is the job of leaders to offer message of unity and bridge gap? Or job of Democrats to leave strongly held positions and blindly follow? Is there ANYONE willing to find middle ground anymore?

@Chrismullaney10 @SalenaZito 1. I'm not sure I would categorize as no actual harm. 2. If true, perhaps you're right. But the lying about it and self-righteous indignation are disqualifying in and of themselves.

This, in itself, is disqualifying in my opinion.		For the record, I'm a moderate independent. MOR all the way. I did NOT have my mind made up ahead of time. But the despicable way that the victims have been treated and his lack of self-control have been very telling to me. https://t.co/H0TcrgTqdv

I'm a strong woman. I learned to adapt. I learned to work the system from the bottom. But I'm under no illusion that I had equal legal or social standing at the time. My greatest tool in change was raising sons, not changing my father or the men like him.
The single most confusing part of the last 2 yrs and the stand against sexual predators is how we try to judge how it was then by how it is now. It's great that we don't accept abuse any more, but to say we don't understand those who didn't buck the system then ... weren't there. https://t.co/Cs7mHYiF5k
@lenny_phil No, not at all. And I expect the bottom line on my taxes to be worse, even though my "tax rate" might have gotten marginally better because of how it treats dependents and deductions. But my 401K and other investments are doing quite well. But they weren't doing poorly w/ Obama.

@AprilMa74912403 @ToeTaggeler @JeremiahMoore10 @nobleeffort55 I'm happy for you, Toe Tagger. Me, personally, I have about $200 less, plus my insurance went way up again. And I'm a single mom with a kid in college. Thanks, Trump!
I just finished walking 1.76 miles in 30m:28s with #Endomondo #endorphins https://t.co/fACg4ls8js
@mizdivaca Well, the kid was referred for a lot of stuff. No one got him help. You know, when you are hostile and unlikable people are less likely to even try. It's sad.
@mizdivaca It's hard to know. I'm sure the kids made mistakes all around. It's hard to be a teenager even under the most perfect circumstances. The adults, though ... there was a lot of failure there.
@MyCatADemocrat And the same to you.
@MyCatADemocrat My husband often feeds them when I work late. They scream at him and then don't want the food unless I give it to them. I saw this meme and thought this must be similar to what happens when I'm not home. https://t.co/0KgQgZtavL
@MyCatADemocrat Toby, the dog, can actually herd cats. None of them are bothered by his presence. He wishes they would run when he tries to chase them, but they just file their nails and sneer. I would fear for my husband if he didn't have the dog to protect him. https://t.co/LG1KgrGX3Y
@MyCatADemocrat Every cat is unique. Just ask them! LOL!
@MyCatADemocrat This is Olivia now. She got quite a bit darker, but still unusual markings. The V on her forehead makes her always look like she's about to murder someone. She is the most evil of all my cats, but probably just because she is the youngest. She's also sweet, when she wants to be. https://t.co/ogGP9kPIyb
@MyCatADemocrat Harmony is a calico. She had 2 brown tabbies, 1 orange tabby (rare female), and then Olivia, a chocolate tortie. She was the weirdest little thing when she was small. She is quite striking now. Olivia also has a tail that is almost 3" longer than any other cat in the house.
@MyCatADemocrat Have a great day!
@MyCatADemocrat This is Harmony with her babies and Harmony now, enjoying some sunshine. She was a good mom, but like most moms was thoroughly relieved once they were weaned. https://t.co/snDanFUJQs
@MyCatADemocrat This is beautiful Ashley, then and now. She was 3 weeks old when we rescued her from the box of snarling (&amp; sick) ferals at the yard sale. Yep, that is Max, her big brother, 5 weeks her senior. https://t.co/f8lLSGst0z
@MyCatADemocrat Awww! All very good looking cats! Thanks for making me smile. I'm at work right now (&amp; working hard, as you can see). So I have to settle for pictures! These are Max &amp; Olivia as little imps. Max just turned 11 &amp; Olivia is 3. It's probably time for me to get another foster family. https://t.co/CzNQG4H9fB
@MyCatADemocrat The wonder of the moment is that someone saw her get dumped. Their loss is my enormous gain. Harmony &amp; Olivia are evil little gremlins who own my heart. The other babies charm/rule other homes. I'm glad you found your refuge. Every creature deserves love &amp; safety. XO
@MyCatADemocrat Despite the good photo ops, I think Max would be a TERRIBLE president. He's lazy, he's demanding, and something of a despot. My dog would be a better president, but he says he enjoys life too much to want that job. #TGIF Happy to think about cats instead of politics for a change!
@MyCatADemocrat That's very sweet of you. I'm so sorry for your loss. Are lives are forever enriched for having been owned by a cat. Besides Max &amp; Olivia, we have Ashley (feral kitten from a yard sale!) &amp; Harmony (Olivia's mom, dumped in a park with her 4 tiny babies by the family she trusted).
@MyCatADemocrat And this is Max's best frenemy, Toby! We have a very happy home. Adoption is the best! But I ask myself every day: #WhoSavedWho https://t.co/F0gG6fwGHV
@MyCatADemocrat This is the first time Max met Olivia. She was a foster fail because SOMEHOW she managed to stay furever! Like I said, he is not fond of other cats, but he accepted her. She grew to be his size and now they wrestle for control, literally and figuratively. #OwnedByACat https://t.co/oqHKdSxQin
@MyCatADemocrat Scars add character. If you are anything like any of the cats that let me live in my home, you are a character! I'm sure your staff are happy you are there, too!
@MyCatADemocrat Weird, because he doesn't really like other cats. He likes humans and dogs. And tiny kittens. Best foster grandpa ever!
@MyCatADemocrat This is my boss. He was babysitting one of our bottle baby fosters. https://t.co/9N6rKc6sjI

I have to admit I'm worried, although pleasantly surprised to see the history was better than I thought. I want to retire in 10 years and I have to get this last kid through college. But I trust more in God and in my own ingenuity than in the president or the government.

@TerryLewis @ForrestBoySwag @andrewgranda2_ @captcapella @redsteeze God bless you and your family!
@TerryLewis @ForrestBoySwag @andrewgranda2_ @captcapella @redsteeze Well, no one cares how much you know, until they know how much you care. If we are to offer Jesus as THE solution, we need to be cognizant of that fact. Again, the appearance of not caring is very damaging to your argument. And again, you have been truly decent here. Kudos to u!
@TerryLewis @ForrestBoySwag @andrewgranda2_ @captcapella @redsteeze I have long said that. No truly qualified person would want the problem. Do you think it's fixable?
@TerryLewis @ForrestBoySwag @andrewgranda2_ @captcapella @redsteeze The government paid some bills in the beginning, but the church &amp; the people helped me get back on my feet and live the good life. It was a great partnership, perhaps too much for either one alone. Hey, today is that 19 yo's first election! Hope he's part of the solution!
@TerryLewis @ForrestBoySwag @andrewgranda2_ @captcapella @redsteeze I didn't mean that poverty causes soul sickness. I meant that indifference does. I was pretty poor the day my 19 yo was born &amp; was fired for missing work (to give birth). We wouldn't have made it w/o a little help in the beginning &amp; I do my best to give back now.
@TerryLewis @ForrestBoySwag @andrewgranda2_ @captcapella @redsteeze Terry, I need to get back to work. Your lack of venom on the internet is refreshing. I believe if we could have more conversation like this we could solve a lot of problems. Most people can't get 3 tweets w/o name calling and blame. United we stand! But divided, well, you know...
@TerryLewis @ForrestBoySwag @andrewgranda2_ @captcapella @redsteeze My circumstances are WAY over that, but as a single mom w/ son in college &amp; disabled boyfriend, things are still difficult. More worried about how the government funds corporate America &amp; the war machine than helping the poor.
@TerryLewis @ForrestBoySwag @andrewgranda2_ @captcapella @redsteeze I personally do all that I can. I know some churches that do as well. But there are 55,000 homeless people in my city, an increase of 75% over the last 6 years. The median rent is $1740 for 2 bedroom and median per capita individual income is $27749. Hard to value life w/o value.
@TerryLewis @ForrestBoySwag @andrewgranda2_ @captcapella @redsteeze I don't think he'd be too fond of most of our religious or political leaders now. So what to do?
@TerryLewis @ForrestBoySwag @andrewgranda2_ @captcapella @redsteeze We vote for politicians who create policies that favor the rich, because their dollars gets them elected, not because the rich are somehow more enlightened. And we vote for them because of being a pro-life one trick pony! Personal responsibility is center of this heart problem.
@TerryLewis @ForrestBoySwag @andrewgranda2_ @captcapella @redsteeze I'm not calling for the gvmt to do that. I'm calling for Americans to do that. But if the government doesn't, more people better pitch in. It's cruel to insist babies be born who will suffer every day of their lives. That's where the heart sickness, the soul sickness, comes from.
@TerryLewis @ForrestBoySwag @andrewgranda2_ @captcapella @redsteeze But we aren't doing, for the most part. And somehow the social engineers got the Christians all riled up where they appear to be some of the most unloving, heartless people on the planet. I don't blindly believe that, but talk is cheap. I'd like to see some action.
@TerryLewis @ForrestBoySwag @andrewgranda2_ @captcapella @redsteeze Terry, I said can WE do this as a nation. I said nothing about the government. That's the problem! If we don't do it, the government BETTER. It's hard to care for the widows &amp; orphans when my taxes are so high paying for corporate welfare &amp; the war machine. Where do we start?
@TerryLewis @ForrestBoySwag @andrewgranda2_ @captcapella @redsteeze Are we going to support a young family, financially &amp; emotionally, seeing to adequate opportunities for affordable housing, jobs, education, food? I mean, Jesus knew He had to meet the needs of the people b4 they could hear Him. Can we do this as a nation?
@TerryLewis @ForrestBoySwag @andrewgranda2_ @captcapella @redsteeze Okay, Terry, fair enough. There is indeed a heart problem. Are you truly pro-life or only pro-birth? All the perps of crimes managed to get born. Someone/ something failed them growing up, though. Are we going to support someone w/ crisis pregnancy if they choose to give birth?
@captcapella @ForrestBoySwag @redsteeze @andrewgranda2_ The good thing about this is that they WILL learn. Not all life lessons are what we want or correspond to our beliefs.
This will be my 19 year old son's first election. He thought it wasn't a "big" election, but I told him he has more power with state and local government than the other stuff. So he's researching his choices and we'll go at lunch time. #AD45 #Elections2018 https://t.co/1QPlwclII8
@kinnaman_joe @TitusNation And, Joe, in all fairness my taxes would have gone up with anyone because of the stage of life I'm in, but I was one of the groups under Trump's plan that would be particularly hit hard. And living in California, so is my excellent employer, so no help with a raise this year.
I just finished walking 2.24 miles in 38m:57s with #Endomondo #endorphins https://t.co/AtVPwgewJ8
@kinnaman_joe @TitusNation It did. So at this point, it's about flat. My rate of return for 2016 was 20%. Hopefully it won't be catastrophic before I retire. I'm more concerned about my 529 as my son is currently in college. My taxes also went up.
@DewDropInn222 Your dog is adorable!
@TitusNation I'm not a Trumper and unfortunately my retirement plan seems to be marching down the drain with theirs. Sad!

@OmShivaJanice It's not an old idea that "they" want us smart enough to operate the machines, but not smart enough to ask questions.
@OmShivaJanice Hard to "like" this because it is so sad. I am grateful that I was able to homeschool my son because he was taught critical thinking. Since I used their curriculum, the supplementary stuff could have been done as easily for a public school student. Parents have some culpability.

@MyJustOpinion @MarlerMorris @rolandscahill We probably haven't had a decent president since Ike. My hatred of Trump is not an endorsement for anyone else. I'm not trying to be difficult. The tax plan is truly not favorable for me.
@MyJustOpinion @MarlerMorris @rolandscahill So you're saying you actually think that every single person is in a favorable situation with this tax reform? You're certainly brainwashed. It also is not favorable for my boss, so no raise or bonus. I have less money and I have to listen to the idiotic trumpet's propaganda?
@MyJustOpinion @MarlerMorris @rolandscahill You are a moron. My family has been in Los Angeles since 1902. Not a fan of Jerry Brown, either time. Many things influence my staying here. If it were all about money, sure, maybe I'd leave. I have substantial roots here. I've never voted Dem in my life. I still hate Trump.
@MyJustOpinion @MarlerMorris @rolandscahill Right. I'm dumb. That must be it. The numbers on my check after the beginning of the year must have been my active imagination. And all my deductions gone, so bottom line I will pay thousands more. My mutual funds gained 0-15% annually under Obama. Now they are flat.
@MyJustOpinion @MarlerMorris @rolandscahill I would have been, but I got a tax increase. Then I thought, well at least my 401k is doing well. But that's not true anymore either. I'm sure it will be fixed by the time I retire ... but not by Trump.

@Tux_299 @jonagelo @xLijepa @Melissa62263619 @LillyDillyDawg @Education4Libs The recent KY shooting was at my granddaughter's HS. My niece's HS in AZ apprehended kid with gun last week. I have skin in the game. I would not send my kid to a school where the teachers were packing. I vehemently disagree with pulling education funds or underpaying guards.
@jonagelo @Tux_299 @xLijepa @Melissa62263619 @LillyDillyDawg @Education4Libs By the proposed numbers ^^ you would like to put 20 armed guards in the typical CA high school, and pay them less than an office worker or bus driver. I don't like it for multiple reasons. This would take away critical dollars for education. What could go wrong?

@davecadaqu @JoyAnnReid I understood what you meant. I just laughed at the wording. You really aren't wrong, however you interpret it. ;)
@davecadaqu @JoyAnnReid LOL! "Women and sane men" as opposed to "sane women and men."
@LillyDillyDawg @karenvance0810 @jonagelo @Education4Libs Yeah, this would be one of those places. LAUSD is a joke. I no longer have school age children, so this is a hypothetical argument. School was so bad here, I pulled my last kid out and homeschooled him. Now I worry about college. They have lockdown several times a semester.
@karenvance0810 @jonagelo @LillyDillyDawg @Education4Libs I think that would be great, but how many are there? Don't misunderstand. I'm not against guns &amp; I'm not a liberal. My BIL is an oath keeper &amp; I'm used to responsible gun use. My point is that I don't think we can afford this. I still can't believe police are paid less than $36k.
@Melissa62263619 @jonagelo @LillyDillyDawg @Education4Libs I'm sorry, that is shocking to me. Yes, Los Angeles is literally the worst. Read another article today that we have the most unaffordable housing. But police start at more than double that. You couldn't rent an apartment here making $36k. Seriously. No guards for our kids.

@jonagelo @LillyDillyDawg @Education4Libs I don't think law enforcement makes less than this in most places, but if they do, they are grossly underpaid. The military, though, wow! Amazing what they put on the line for so little. Much respect!
@jonagelo @LillyDillyDawg @Education4Libs No, they certainly don't, although most people cannot afford to just use their time for altruistic things. I don't believe we need swat teams in schools. I don't believe we need guns in schools. I don't think PP should be deprived of funds to arm someone at a school.
@jonagelo @LillyDillyDawg @Education4Libs And I'm sorry you're willing to accept that, while the 1% make 100x more than their devoted employees. I come from a time when people could be fairly compensated for their contributions. I'm sorry that you're angry that I would like to see you and public servants prosper.
@LillyDillyDawg @Education4Libs This has nothing to do with minimum wage. ANY armed job is potentially deadly and certainly opens you up to criticism if you make a mistake. The people who think their life is worth $36k are not people I would want guarding my kids. Get real! A job is about the money.
Based on the idiotic things I hear Republicans say and support these days, I have a new theory: They are pro-birth because they hate children and just need more of them to abuse, destroy, and use for target practice! And we thought it was because of sanctity of life.
@LillyDillyDawg @Education4Libs I make 3x that amount of money. I sure wouldn't work as an armed guard for $36000/yr. You think risking your life is worth poverty wages?

@Youre2Deluded @TheDemocrats Some people will do better. I did the best I ever did in my life during the Obama years. One person's experience does not necessarily explain everything. And individuals, too, must take responsibility for their destiny. I am middle class because of my hustle, not the president.
@msdebbidooda @HoarseWisperer @PrincessBravato It was that way in California, too. I don't think it's that weird at home, but it is sort of strange for a professional man to do it out in public, don't you think?
@hrenee80 Not to decry the little victories, but a bonus is 1 time thing &amp; you have to work there over 20 years to get $1K bonus. Most people will get $200. Better than nothing. Raising wages would be better. In CA, Walmart just raised starting wage to our minimum wage. I'm not impressed.
@ScottPresler You can spin it however you want, but the minimum wage here in California is $11 an hour. So they raised their starting wage to minimum wage. How sporting! We are excited! There are 3 other states with higher minimum wages, so they must be the happiest Walmart employees of all!

@MericanAnna @AKelticgirl2 @TopherSpiro These family members of mine do espouse family values. They are what the left is looking at when they talk of hypocrisy.

@AKelticgirl2 @MericanAnna @TopherSpiro No, I thought her point was fair. There are many who are slaves to the system, regardless of race. My ex's white trash family would be a fine example. The question is ... how to break the cycle? Education seems key.

@BraderGatorNYC Here's the thing, though. Whether it is true or not, more than half the country thinks he is destroying things and that's he's an unhinged maniac. I don't disagree with some/a lot of his policies, but they don't feel at all like victories with his polarizing force.

@BraderGatorNYC Agreed! That's why I long for a moderate, centrist choice. More specifically, I tend to be socially liberal, fiscally conservative -- a Libertarian -- but the trend seems to be socially conservative, and strangely, bigger government. The opposite of me, basically.
@thehill Why am I not surprised?

@BraderGatorNYC @avarisclari @JTrenz92 @DebbieD44801735 @A_Smart_Liberal @peskypedaler @realDonaldTrump I dunno. The atheists I know celebrate Christmas. Not like religious Christmas: No church, no baby Jesus, but they have a tree, presents, a feast. There are always fringe people on both sides &amp; they are squawking the loudest. Most people, in my experience, are reasonable.
@BraderGatorNYC @avarisclari @JTrenz92 @DebbieD44801735 @A_Smart_Liberal @peskypedaler @realDonaldTrump For sure! Like I said, if you're wishing joy into the greeting, it's welcome. Not sure why anyone would feel otherwise.
@BraderGatorNYC @avarisclari @JTrenz92 @DebbieD44801735 @A_Smart_Liberal @peskypedaler @realDonaldTrump I've been known to say that occasionally. Not as an act of war, just to have fun.
@BraderGatorNYC @avarisclari @JTrenz92 @DebbieD44801735 @A_Smart_Liberal @peskypedaler @realDonaldTrump I agree. I wouldn't leave over Christmas decorations either. I don't "gotta" go to work. I "get to" go to work. It's back to perspective. The media says most people lack it, but I'm happily unconvinced except when online.
@BraderGatorNYC @avarisclari @JTrenz92 @DebbieD44801735 @A_Smart_Liberal @peskypedaler @realDonaldTrump I'm sorry that was your experience. I'm in Corporate America, too, and they always liked my little tree and decorations. I noticed people usually said Happy Holidays during the season and Merry Christmas the week proceeding. Never any negativity.
@BraderGatorNYC @avarisclari @JTrenz92 @DebbieD44801735 @A_Smart_Liberal @peskypedaler @realDonaldTrump And I live in liberal Los Angeles. I've never known liberals to be snowflakes. I mean, maybe unique but never delicate. We're all just people who want a decent life and social engineering says we should be mad at each other. But I'm not! I love everyone!
@BraderGatorNYC @avarisclari @JTrenz92 @DebbieD44801735 @A_Smart_Liberal @peskypedaler @realDonaldTrump And I thought about if someone said Happy Yule or Happy Hanukkah to me. I'm not Pagan or Jewish, but I was delighted. I asked about their celebrations. I was truly interested in their traditions. I think the media made this war and we are all collateral damage.
@BraderGatorNYC @avarisclari @JTrenz92 @DebbieD44801735 @A_Smart_Liberal @peskypedaler @realDonaldTrump I've been hearing that in the media for years, but I've asked and never found a person who would say they were offended when someone said Merry Christmas to them. I asked atheists, Jewish folks, etc. They all shrugged, no big deal.
@avarisclari @BraderGatorNYC @JTrenz92 @DebbieD44801735 @A_Smart_Liberal @peskypedaler @realDonaldTrump Yes, I remember it that way, too. I just know when someone wishes me well, it is a good thing. I don't care what the wording is. War is ... violent, devastation, genocide, hostile, betrayal, hateful, bloodshed, void. I don't think anyone has ever wished that on me or Christmas.
@avarisclari @BraderGatorNYC @JTrenz92 @DebbieD44801735 @A_Smart_Liberal @peskypedaler @realDonaldTrump You seem like a reasonable guy, Christopher. Happy Holidays and a prosperous New Year! I never understood how "Happy Holidays" was a war on Christmas. Holiday = Holy Day. It would seem that expression confirms Christmas as a religious holiday. Capitalism ... not so much!

I thank the Christians yesterday who have not been blinded by the party line, who could think for themselves. Doug Jones was the better choice, but I know it was not without struggle for a deeply red state. Thank you for doing the right thing, AL!
Jesus never opposed a human soul. He never said anyone was beyond redemption. He did oppose the rich and powerful religious leaders of the time -- not their souls, but their beliefs. He didn't bully, he didn't oppress, he didn't condemn.
This is hard issue for me, too. My son was born at 6 mos, weighing 2 lbs. I could have legally aborted him at an age where he survived! But being pro-life means so much more than pro-birth. I want to protect all children -- all citizens! We can do better!
This is often the red herring, because abortion is the law of the land. Being pro-life is not going to simply end abortion. Voting for reasonable people on both sides of the fence is how you address difficult issues -- not party line voting without careful reflection.
I understand how hard this choice must be for pro-life Christians. Jones is not pro-abortion, as I saw stated. He is pro-choice. No one is really pro-abortion any more than anyone is really anti-choice. Words matter!
By charts they are putting out: 	Per every 1000 voters in AL yesterday, 95 out of 350 white men, 109 out of 310 white women, 102 out of 110 black men, and 167 out of 180 black women voted for Jones. They're all people who can be proud they made the moral over expected choice!

@TinoBeano @RogueSNRadvisor There's an explanation I hadn't considered... https://t.co/zdzcoduwy6
@SenFranken 6/ Your wives, mothers, daughters, sisters, and friends are being told to sit down and shut up and let the men figure this out. We are outraged if the wrong side touches you, but sometimes there are bigger things at stake. Be sure to tell your baby daughter as you put her to bed.
@SenFranken 5/ In the meantime, what about the women? Even if you don't believe the accusers -- AND I DO -- but even if you don't, what about other victims out there that have learned that they will be re-violated all over again if they do come forward?
@SenFranken 4/ But then if #NoMoore isn't ousted, the dems can and will use this as a spectacular fundraising tool to flip even more seats in 2018. In a way, it works better for the left if he does win and if no one does anything. So much #TakingOneForTeam on both sides!
@SenFranken 3/ If Moore loses tomorrow, the seat is flipped. Republicans don't want that. But if there is an ethics probe and he is ousted after winning, then the Alabama republican governor can appoint another republican, so no real harm to the party standing in congress.
@SenFranken 2/ But not as wrong as child molestation. However, his resignation will result in the Democrat governor appointing another democrat. Seat isn't flipped, dems appear to be on the right side of history. Not as simple with #NoMoore.
THREAD/ This is not a partisan issue, but it is being played out in a partisan way. Here's why Republicans are voting for a child molester #NoMoore and why @SenFranken was forced to fall on his sword. Don't get me wrong -- Franken did wrong.

A Republican, Mark Foley, resigned his House seat when accused of sending sexually explicit e-mails to teenage male congressional pages. https://t.co/MeBJFKqmBz
Repub Strom Thurmond shows we have actually come a long, long way. He had a daughter out of wedlock with a 16 year old African American girl in 1925. He was 22. He was a segregationist and didn't claim his progeny, although he did contribute financially.  https://t.co/hLDTNrKkYL

@TheeSylvia  I miss your beautiful heart!  &lt;3
@euroweenie No broken bones but maybe a couple broken hearts.
@euroweenie Saw Specials @ Nokia last PM. "Wish I had lipstick on my shirt instead of piss stains on my shoes." Classic.  WYWH.
@TheTweetOfGod Yes, they do, although often the reason is you're stupid and make bad decisions.
@euroweenie Ah geez, I meant Olds.  See how long it's been?  Like I could forget.  I was with you when you found that car.  Remember?
@euroweenie Naw, sold the convert 2 years ago. Have truck &amp; no pymt. So practical! Friends are so stable, no one asks help moving!
@quarrygirl @hugostacos Omgosh!
@euroweenie Drove up Regal on Sun to turn around for Paquito Mas parking lot. Saw yr old balcony &amp; thought of old times. No snow 4 ur Buick!
@euroweenie I remember pics of you shoveling that driveway from yrs ago but it wasn't quite as deep. Just another excuse to work from home!
@euroweenie It was cold enough for a Deviant Nation hoodie at work today. No big, I got a heater.  Being a grownup brings options. #warmth
@euroweenie Nothing is new under the sun.  It's all been done.  It's all been done.  How're things eastside?  Enjoy the blizzard?
I have made a whole 13 tweets and then I was hacked!  Technology is getting so efficient! #TwitterIsForTwits
@euroweenie LOL, I'm nothing if not resourceful. Either it will work or it won't. The dog needs a yard. Maybe a basement to keep the kid...
@euroweenie not married w children, dealing w homeschool, want to buy a house, squeezing by w no $, and those young things r 2 much work! :)
@mittromney Is welfare the answer for the new citizens that will result from limiting access to abortion and birth control? #AskMitt
Hey, this pushes me into the double-digit tweet zone. Should I tell ya what's for dinner or just a blow-by-blow of my day? #numbertenbaby

The Droid X knows stuff about my friends that I didn't know before. It's not a smart phone, it's a genius phone. In a stalker kind of way.
Loving the new enV Touch. Might just use this Twitter thing. Who knows?
Loving someone is giving them the ability to destroy you ... and then trusting them not to.  It is a test neither of us passed.
I wish my stomach didn't always feel sick.  Or at least that this sickness would make me lose weight.
What the heck do I do with this thing?  Tweet tweet
