Guy I made a dinostic I just realized that there was a quality filter so I was getting only the good tweets, sorry I made a ass out of myself, but when I started Twitter I wasn't expecting that I would tweets so I must either turn it on on forgotten about or it's default. #love https://t.co/1ld4CSZvCO
It's back again wtf Twitter
One last reminder I saw inconsistencies with the Twitter mentions so Mabey it just a problem with Twitter
I saw a few of replies that Twitter didn't notify so I couldn't get a comeback, because it would be old, and also I think if it's very offensive it doesn't notify you, I saw a lot of replies that were racist. #twitterisconfusing #staycool
Hey guys I just realized now that the mention notifications only notifies you based on a alcrium so if you want to get the real reply on you replies look up your name, you will get all of the replys
