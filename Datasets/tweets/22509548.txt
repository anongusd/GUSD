The report is not a final report on the IRS Targeting scandal but it nonetheless draws on more documents &amp; interviews than any other so far.
These employees expressed a general loathing toward them even while begrudgingly admitting that those organizations were in compliance.
Conservative organizations were not just singled out because of their political beliefs‚Äîthey were targeted by IRS officials and employees.
Those interviews were with IRS, Treasury, &amp; Justice Department employees. The report concludes that:
The report represents findings from the review of over 1.3 million pages of documents and 52 transcribed interviews.

Read the full @GOPoversight statement about Gruber and Tavenner being called to testify on #Obamacare here -&gt; http://t.co/tmaxceEr7j
I expect Gruber &amp; Tavenner to testify publicly about the arrogance &amp; deceptions surrounding the passage &amp; implementation of #Obamacare.
The American people deserve honesty, transparency and respect from those who forced the federal government into their healthcare. #Obamacare
The numbers provided by CMS were deceptive and obscured the number of Americans running from #Obamacare exchange plans.
But when @GOPoversight checked the numbers, we discovered that dental plans were added to the health plan enrollment count. #Obamacare
CMS Administrator Marilyn Tavenner testified before @GOPoversight in Sept that the Admin met its goals by enrolling 7.3 million individuals.
Gruber even credited ‚Äòthe stupidity of the American voter‚Äô for allowing the Obama Admin to mislead the public.
Jonathan Gruber, one of #Obamacare‚Äôs chief architects, publicly lauded the ‚Äòlack of transparency‚Äô that was necessary to pass the law.
We were told the individual mandate wasn‚Äôt a tax. None of these were true. #Obamacare
Americans were told that if they liked their plans and doctors, they could keep them. #Obamacare
From the outset, #Obamacare has been the poster child for this Administration‚Äôs broken transparency promises.
Obama admin admits inflating #Obamacare Numbers by 400K after @GOPoversight discovered the deception.

Obama admin appears to be dismissing the public's right to know w/same deceptive arrogance that helped them pass #Obamacare to start with.
The admin appears to be calling its #Obamacare transparency plan from the Jonathan Gruber playbook.
HHS must provide a clear and detailed account of who knew about this decision and when they knew it.
The Obama admin misreported #ObamaCare‚Äôs enrollment figures twice--and changed language from 'health plans' to 'MarketPlace coverage'
HHS is now saying the inflated #Obamacare enrollment statistics were just a ‚Äòmistake.‚Äô

Read the full @bloomberg story about #Obamacare inflated enrollment numbers here: http://t.co/HZhNAlVbX0 http://t.co/aZCpXXz6Xq
When @GOPoversight asked for raw enrollment data, investigators were able to confirm that nearly 400k plans were dental by matching plan IDs
But in May of last year, the Obama admin separated the 8 mil health plan figure from the 1.1 mil dental coverage. #Obamacare
At that hearing, CMS Administrator Tavenner did not elaborate or break out dental plans as CMS has done in the past. #Obamacare
At a Sept @GOPoversight hearing, CMS administrator Tavenner said 7.3 mil people were "enrolled in the health insurance marketplace coverage"
Instead of offering an accurate accounting, the admin engaged in an effort to obscure and downplay number of #Obamacare dropouts.
After touting 8 mil initial #Obamacare signups for medical plans, four months later they engaged in concerted effort to obscure dropout rate

Taxpayers have the right to know the true cost of the union activity they are funding.

"Official time" is when a fed worker stops performing the job they were hired for and engages in union activity at taxpayer expense instead.

Despite the Obama Admin‚Äôs habit of moving the goal posts, #ObamaCare is not delivering the results Americans were originally promised.
Under #Obamacare, Americans have experienced broken exchanges, cancelled coverage, higher premiums, and unaffordable deductibles.
The prospect of lower enrollment figures should come as no surprise, given #Obamacare's troubled track record over the last year.
Once again, #HHS is lowering expectations ahead of #Obamacare's open enrollment period, a tactic now par for the course for the Obama Admin.
So let's talk about #Obamacare enrollment estimates.

A free and open internet allows Americans to operate small businesses, communicate freely, &amp; stay competitive in a changing global economy.
The internet's revolutionary success is due in large part to an entrepreneurialism that adapts and innovates freely as the internet evolves.

In Feb, @GOPoversight and @WaysandMeansGOP released a report about expansion of #Obamacare subsidies. --&gt; http://t.co/FIZer3bodP
Proponents of #Obamacare cannot cover up their regrets by ignoring the plain text of the law when it proves inconvenient.
The statute provides no authority for subsidies through the federal exchange. #Obamacare
The sloppy and rushed nature of the process that created #Obamacare is rightly catching up to it.
Adequate analysis was never conducted of the government's authority to provide premium subsidies through exchanges established by fed gov't.
#Obamacare was pushed on the American people through a highly partisan effort.

Click here for #DOJ‚Äôs cover letter accompanying document production ‚Äî&gt; http://t.co/GDvZRmyMTU #FastandFurious
This doc production is nonetheless a victory for the legislative branch, for transparence, and for efforts to check Executive Branch power.
I am deeply concerned that some redactions to these #FastandFurious docs may still be inappropriate and contrary to judge‚Äôs order.
Because of this, our court case will continue. #FastandFurious
These pages still do not represent the entire universe of the docs the House is seeking related to the botched #FastandFurious scandal.
Judge‚Äôs order compelled the production of 64,280 pages that he and Pres. Obama illegally withheld from Congress. #FastandFurious
When Eric Holder wants to know why he was the first Attorney General held in criminal contempt of Congress, he can read the judge‚Äôs order.
Approximately two-thirds of the universe of focus that #DOJ withheld from Congress has now been shown to be outside scope of Exec Privilege.
In effect, last night‚Äôs doc production is an admission that #DOJ never had legitimate grounds to withhold them. #FastandFurious
Sheer volume of last night‚Äôs doc production show POTUS &amp; Atty Gen attempted to extend scope of Exec Privilege beyond historical boundaries.
#DOJ acknowledges that docs turned over are NOT covered by Executive Privilege.

Report shows that AUSA Hurley failed to bring charges against suspected criminals when he had enough evidence, as in #FastandFurious.
This placed public safety at risk on both sides of the border by allowing the trafficking of grenades to narco-terrorists.
Failure of the AZ U.S. Attorney's Office to take action allowed a dangerous individual to remain free and continue his criminal activities.
The IG's review found that federal prosecutors should've approved the arrest &amp; prosecution of Jean Baptiste Kingery long before they did.

Any classified version of the Secret Service panel report should be submitted to Congress in an appropriate manner.
The Secret Service panel should make an unclassified version of its report and recommendations available to Congress and the public.
The purpose of which is to ensure that information the agency provides is accurate and timely.
Examine the process by which Secret Service communicates with Congress, the press, the American people, and the President.
Review not only recent security lapses, but full range of management, training &amp; cultural issues that contribute to security failures.
In a letter to DHS Secretary Johnson, we requested that the independent panel tasked with examining these issues take the following actions:
Following the hearing, Dir. Pierson resigned, but serious questions predated her tenure, and her resignation has not resolved them.
This concern extends to troubling reports involving protocol failures, technology lapses, training reductions, and internal cultural issues.
At our Secret Service hearing this week, Oversight Members expressed bipartisan apprehension about a series of dangerous security breaches.

POTUS and the Senate must be expeditious, but time &amp; care must be taken to ensure our next AG recognizes &amp; does not repeat Holder's mistakes
These actions are an abuse of Holder's office and fail to uphold the values of our Constitution.
Holder has strong-armed reporters, practically ignored high-level wrongdoing, and blocked his own agency's Inspector General's access.
By needlessly injecting politics into law enforcement, Holder's legacy has eroded more confidence in our legal system than any AG before him
Holder also has the dubious distinction of, in a vote supported by 17 Dem Members, being the first AG held in criminal contempt of the House
Eric Holder is the most divisive U.S. Attorney General in modern history.

The @GOPoversight hearing on White House intrusion incident will be held Tues, Sept 30, at 10 AM.
I look forward to hearing from Secret Service Director Pierson about what steps the agency is taking to improve security.
These security breaches reveal our weaknesses as well as our response capabilities to our nation's enemies.
The recent intrusion of an individual into the White House is the latest in a string of high profile incidents for the Secret Service.

Refresher: @GOPoversight report released in March on Lois Lerner's role in #IRStargeting http://t.co/WfhwVx9kfq
Lerner appears to have great confidence that her Obama Admin allies will not consider legal action after she declined to discuss IRS actions
Her decision to make unsubstantiated claims to a media outlet while claiming 5th Amendment protections from answer Congress is telling.
Instead, Lerner obstructed Congress' investigation. #IRStargeting
If Lois Lerner had nothing to hide and did nothing wrong in the #IRStargeting scandal, she would have chosen to answer basic questions.
