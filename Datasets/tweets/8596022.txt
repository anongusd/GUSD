@cshasarrived @PamDidner @amazon It’s a low-quality imprint that’s illegal for sale outside of India. Resellers are selling it on @amazon. Amazon has placed it alongside the legit version. It’s cheaper, so unsuspecting US buyers are buying it &amp; are disappointed when they get this janky copy with a bad cover.

@ryanfliss @amazon They aren’t the manufacturer. My issue is that Amazon is allowing resellers to list illegal copies alongside the legit hardcover.

@davedelaney @nytimes The best.
@peterkim @amazon The rights have since been revoked, BTW.
@peterkim @amazon No. I'm not. This is an Indian version that isn't supposed to be for sale in the US. My issue is that 1) it is by resellers who are simply ignoring the laws; and 2) it's listed alonside the hardcover, like it's both legit and the same quality (it's neither).

@_Natty_Daddy_ @WileyBusiness @amazon I'd like to see it dropped from the book page on @amazon at the very least.
@_Natty_Daddy_ @WileyBusiness @amazon Yes. My issue is that the "paperback" version appears on the Amazon US book listing right beside the hardcover, even thought it's not supposed to be sold in the US? That's whacked.
@ImChrisBarboza @amazon No -- you can find it in bookstores and through other booksellers.
@tonyfaustino @annhandley @amazon @AmazonHelp Thank you, Tony!

@jbernoff @mdc912 @amazon AGREED. @AmazonHelp
@fatemehx2 @remarkmarketing @amazon ugh.
@millertime_baby @amazon Yes. Amazon is listing that unofficial reseller version next to the hardcover copy, at a lower price. So it appears legit... but it's not.
@SFMuse @amazon It's so distressing.
@AmyGWrites Thank you, Amy!
@Note_to_CMO @amazon Bootleg I understand. But for sale next to the legit version on Amazon? NO.
@iamelliot @amazon That's what I'm saying. And @Amazon is selling it alongside the  hardcover... which MAKES IT SEEM like it's legit. It's not.
@Note_to_CMO @amazon I'd laugh if I wasn't so ticked rn.

@juliaborgini Many, many times.

Dear Everyone: Please don't buy ANY paperback version of Everybody Writes. THERE IS NO OFFICIAL PAPERBACK version, even though @amazon wants you to think there it.

@griner I don't disagree. But I'd add that I like some element of self-doubt or uncertainty or self-loathing. Anyway, those are the people I like to hang around... because I find them more open and willing to grow and (usually) truly humble.

Unacceptable @jetblue. How did no one realize that the pilot was in Syracuse... prior to all of us boarding.... ?
It’s flight 1059 BOS &gt; PHL. Not happy with you guys right now. And I’m generally a huge fan. Me right now = 👹
Omg @JetBlue. A 3 1/2 hr delay out of Boston has just been delayed another 90 minutes because there is no pilot? Yet you didn’t know this until we were already all on board, forcing us to deplane? Weather I understand. But this is crazy! 😡

@TravelOregon @TheDrum I love Oregon! I spent a few magical days there last summer in Portland and later at @AllisonInnSpa. Ah-MAY-zing.
@mikemyers614 That's true. But to me the thru-line for all of that is always quality/audience value.

@anthonycoppedge Also a good point. Thanks, Anthony!
@JoeManna You test social posts? Even tweets?

@dougkessler #manholesuppressed
@DigitalMantram True. Good point.
@achitwood I had to read that sentence 3 times but I think I got it.
@TomMartin Right.... I find that's true. Generally response is higher if I share what I think about a link.... not just the link.
@dougkessler Is that true across every platform? (LI, FB, Insta?*)		*suppress manhole covers in this data, please
@KatrinaKibben Is that true across, say, Facebook, LinkedIn, Instagram? Or only here on Twitter?
@gorgansc I feel ya.

@elisadoucette @JKevinParker @drgurner @TIME omg.
@chrismarr101 @TIME SO.	PAINFUL.
@JKevinParker @elisadoucette @drgurner @TIME SAME!!!
@elisadoucette @drgurner @TIME Right. There's no one right answer. But there are wrong answers.
@elisadoucette @drgurner @TIME I totally empathize with their plight... but disrespecting readers is never a stepping stone to monetizing long-term.
Trying to read an article in @TIME and omg is there any wonder why people use ad blockers? You aren't even seeing the animation and hearing the audio. #aggressive https://t.co/al9Ksgi6yT

@kaohlson @BostonContent THANK YOU. And a highlight for me was seeing that book loved so well. That's everything. So nice to meet you, Kathleen!
