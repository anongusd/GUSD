Manhattan Institute is a leading, national think tank focused on advancing free-market ideas among policymakers and the public at large. #IdeasMatter https://t.co/3pRBezM8pe
“I was born and raised in New York, and so I lived through the extraordinary urban revival that MI helped my city—and cities across the country—achieve. I know not only that ideas matter, in other words, but also that MI’s ideas can change lives for the better.” — @reihan https://t.co/NoLmwbA88X
An advocate for families and the working class, @reihan is guaranteed to bring an independent cast of mind to tired debates, while maintaining MI’s support for free markets and intellectual excellence. https://t.co/BfqbkS5Ql8 via @nypost
“Reihan has a long track record of championing smart policy ideas and raising their profile through exceptional journalism. I have no doubt MI will accomplish great things under his leadership.” — MI President Larry Mone
Over the course of his career, @reihan has championed a quality-of-life conservatism that can speak to all Americans, and especially to those seeking to climb the economic ladder. https://t.co/juMXi47tDN https://t.co/WLp7vAtVYU
“MI’s scholars aren’t afraid to take risks, ask hard questions, and challenge the received wisdom. It is an honor for me to help shape the Institute’s next chapter, and to lead an organization with such an impressive track record and so much promise for the future.” — @reihan
A second-generation American, @reihan is the author of “Melting Pot or Civil War?” (Sentinel, 2018), a ‘nuanced’ discussion of immigration policy and, before that, the co-author, with @DouthatNYT, of “Grand New Party” (Doubleday, 2008). https://t.co/3avreHWQBc
“I am delighted that Reihan Salam will be our new president. Reihan is a New Yorker born-and-bred, a product of the city’s public schools, a brilliant communicator, and already a leader among conservative thinkers and policymakers.” — MI Chairman Paul Singer
From 2014 to 2019, @reihan served as the executive editor of @NRO. He has also served as a @NR_Institute Policy Fellow, a contributing editor at @TheAtlantic and @NationalAffairs, and, in 2017, was named a Young Global Leader of the @wef. https://t.co/3avreHWQBc
