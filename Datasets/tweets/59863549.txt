@ananavarro Congratulations Ana!
#BlackEarthRising had some stunningly emotive imagery and storytelling on international and "race" relations.		I'm 1/2 way through and can't wait to see how this will play out.
@reno30 Hmm.  Thanks, we seem to like a lot of similar things - this is helpful.
@DecodnLyfe Yup!! Botn 1977 according to IMDB.	he is around 40 in the season you are watching.		Looks so much younger!
I really don't get the talking a üì∏ with your üòã out trend.		It is only cute on a few ppl
@DecodnLyfe I loved S1. But stopped then so I can gather a few seasons to binge through.		I'll take all three men though. Milo, Sterling and Justin (who still shocks me he is 42)
Decided to watch Black Earth Rising because I need to understand subject matter more and I'll give anything with the brilliant John Goodman a chance.		Then I saw Tamara Tunie's name in credits and thought HELL YEAH!!!

@_RainyDayWoman @BurtanL @bjoewolf Fair and valid point.		However the parallel still exists
@BurtanL @_RainyDayWoman @bjoewolf People kill each other and we hold them accountable.		But when we kill someone with a car - the person is responsible and the car (as the instrument of death) is examined for it's factor (perhaps there is a malfunction) .  We regulate cars cause they are deadly
@_RainyDayWoman @BurtanL @bjoewolf For me.. it would include closing loop holes, background checks, limiting access to mental health sufferers, assault weapons ban
@BurtanL @bjoewolf @_RainyDayWoman While both have the potential to be lethal I think the differentiation is the probability of lethal infliction by a gun is substantially higher than a knife with a greater radius of reach potential. 		It's like saying I can be hit by a bicycle or a car - which is more concerning?
