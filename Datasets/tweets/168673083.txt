#TrumpCuts $193B from SNAP program, which puts food on the table for 66,500 veterans in Georgia. Our heroes deserve better!
The #TrumpCuts budget slashes HUD funding by $6.2B and zeroes out HUD programs critical for revitalizing and expanding affordable housing.
If enacted, the #TrumpBudget would cut $9.2 billion from the U.S. Dept. of Education, harming our best and brightest students and teachers. https://t.co/FvRb3d31H3

@SaucyD514 discrimination is bad.Period. No one endorses that. CFPB policy is not the best way to address that.
@NotoriousVOG Not true. Can still act. CFPB current approach will drive up borrowing costs for low-income consumers. Need a do-over.
@NotoriousVOG Discrimination is bad. CFPB failing to address - they are likely to drive up costs for all borrowers. Need to do over.

@Kennymack1971 @PragmaticObot @PragObots called them out publicly over SNAP, shutdown, ACA, VRA, plenty of other issues, plenty of times.
@Kennymack1971 @PragmaticObot @PragObots VA needs addressing and Boggs needs to be stopped.
@PragObots @PragmaticObot if they call, as they did with Boggs, sure.
@PragmaticObot @PragObots maybe you should use Google to see my comments against cuts to SNAP, government shutdown, and attacks on ACA.
@PragObots @PragmaticObot I officially call out Miller. He is wrong and ignorant. We need to expand more Sunday polls across Georgia.
@PragObots @PragmaticObot I called and visited the WH to personally ask that they not nominate Boggs months before press conferences.
@PragmaticObot @PragObots  state senator called out by many - rightly so. He is wrong. VA and Boggs, no one was stepping up. Not comparable.
@PragmaticObot @PragObots calling for swift action at the VA was the right call and stopping Boggs is the right call. No apologies for that

@aspirational12 @PragObots @Kennymack1971 @waltb31 short sighted since the vote in committee is any day. Blue slip = long term problem.
@aspirational12 @Kennymack1971 @waltb31 @PragObots talk about system after the vote on this lifetime position. This is pending any day.
@PragObots @Kennymack1971 @waltb31 Blue slip is in the past, the committee vote is in the future. Secret lobbying for #Boggs is ongoing.
@jidts07 you know the blue slip has been returned? This is about the committee vote and the secret lobbying for #Boggs happening now.
Still waiting for a public show of support for why #Boggs nomination for lifetime seat is good for GA. Blue slip is not an excuse.
@Kennymack1971 @waltb31 @PragObots who is trashing POTUS? Trashing his bad selection - yes. Judge for life way after his term ends.
@waltb31 @Kennymack1971 @PragObots part of the solution is not allowing this nomination for life to move forward have been fighting 10 mos
@jidts07 So why is he turning his back on those principles now?  He was vocally against #Boggs with other civil rights leaders.
@jidts07 @Crewof42 We have been opposing #Boggs for 10 mos and now someone is jumping ship. Why turn back on progress?
@jidts07 @PragObots @Kennymack1971 Yes, beneath the White House to be making the awful nominations for lifetime appointment in the 1st place
@waltb31 @Kennymack1971 @PragObots We were unified until someone turned their back on their previous position.  Sad, not jealous.
@PragObots I helped Andy Young get to Congress in that same seat way before Lewis was in it.
@jidts07 I was in elected office way before him.
@PragObots @Crewof42 chairman is not secretly trying to push this nomination - blue slip is already in - votes are next step
@PragObots @Crewof42 Chairman Leahy said there is no secret deal with him and the WH on these bad picks. Blue slip = bad excuse for #Boggs
@PragObots @Crewof42 difference between negotiate and capitulate. Blue slip is no excuse for #Boggs, better to leave the seat vacant.

@alfranken In 2003 Boggs opposed final vote on referendum since 1956 flag was not an option. GA voters voted 75% to keep 2003 flag.
@alfranken Boggs voted in 2001 and 2003 on the 1956 flag and had 30 pct African American district. His two-step is disturbing.
You have to look at Boggs' evasiveness with the committee and lack of openness. He wrote a letter of apology for hiding information!

@mmix224 possibly, but not for a lifetime appointment to a federal judgeship
Many white Democrats voted to change the flag and many lost their elections.  Then-Gov. Zell Miller tried to change it.
@BETpolitichick @Crewof42 @rolandsmartin what about his nearly 30 percent African-American constituents?
Boggs' state house district was nearly 30 percent African-American when he twice voted for the Confederate flag.
Boggs voted against changing flag in 2001 and in 2003 he tried to bring it back. It would have flown over every courthouse in the state!!!
I was in the Georgia legislature for nearly 30 years and can tell you that the 1956 Confederate was installed by Jim Crow supporters.
Boggs' past quotes come back to haunt him on many issues.  Where does he stand in regards to the law? Shifty, shady and two-stepping.
Boggs destroyed all of his old records and cannot find others for varying reasons.  He had to write a letter of apology for omission.
@jbendery huge shift.  Buy a carton of eggs and one stinks, why keep the entire dozen?
@johngramlich his state court record is a blank slate on these issues.  Ask them to cite cases reversing his earlier views.
@johngramlich so did the last two Republican governors.
@jbendery I not only wrote a letter, but hand-delivered the letter to the committee office. Many others wrote letters as well.
Of course they will miss WH Counsel.  She gave them a great deal and capitulated rather than negotiated.
@johngramlich @SenatorLeahy You cannot find a single GA Dem supporting Boggs. Imagine if that happened in VT!
@Crewof42 @RepHankJohnson in fact, no Democrat in Georgia can be found in support of Boggs. Deal was cut in secret with GOP only.

House GOP can't count votes, so they cut #SNAP for rural Americans. #Farmbill
Failed GOP whip operation is to blame for killing #SNAP, not the ag community.   #farmbill
Farmers and the ag community did not ask for #SNAP to be used as a wedge issue.  Don't blame ag groups for this failed #farmbill rule
GOP leadership finds a way to separate farm policy from food programs.  Farmers know that they feed the hungry. #farmbill
@jonvwest they are shutting down debate on the rule since they cannot defend the cuts for working families.
GOP leadership is shutting down debate over their failed efforts to garner votes for the #farmbill.
