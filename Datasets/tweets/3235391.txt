@connorwa This is essentially status quo for ethanol as far as numbers go. (A small uptick for other biofuels.) But the numbers aren't the catch; it's the waivers the EPA doles out through small refinery exemptions (SRE), far above what energy dept. recommends.

.@RepDarrenSoto brings up interesting point about untended consequences of King Amendment; how would it apply in cases where some states have legalized marijuana? @SteveKingIA brushes it off with a joke.
King argues that no state should be able to say they won't take a legally produced product of a another state. "I don't want Calif inspectors in my state, and I don't want my state to send inspectors to California."
.@RepJeffDenham notes that California's Prop 2 was litigated in court and found OK because it includes in-state and out-of-state products. King Amendment, he says, is now more far-reaching than when previously debated.
Opponents of King Amendment say it sets a dangerous precedent, depriving states of ability to regulate food and farming. Proponents say rules in one state - for instance, only allowing free range chicken eggs - can force similar regulations on industries in other states.
Calif. @RepJeffDenham refers to King's Amendment as a hasty blanket prohibition, notes that regulations in his state were approved by voters. #FarmBill

"We have a national crisis with our farmers," says @repdavidscott - urges more investment in young &amp; beginning farmer development programs, especially in relation to African-American land grant institutions. #FarmBill

GOP committee members are going through info on their amendments, contributions to #FarmBill - It's going very quickly. For instance, @KYComer just described his amendment that would allow USDA to count inmates for purposes of rural economic development.
In non #FarmBill news... https://t.co/PuuehJYKZp
House Ag Chair @ConawayTX11 says because Dems on committee issued an earlier press release saying they opposed #FarmBill proposals, he "took them at their word" and therefore developed bill without them.
"Rural America is hurting," says @RepOHalleran - takes on lack of funding for rural communities in #FarmBill "Will hurt the smallest and most rural communities in our nation."
Rep. @StaceyPlaskett says #FarmBill may be revenue neutral, but it isn't neutral to families. "There are questions this bill has raised that we have not answered."
Not sure where OK's @RepFrankLucas is going with this - Committee must pass this #FarmBill so it can move forward. Seems to say amendments are responsibility of full House.
Changes to SNAP will negatively impact 23,000 active military duty households says @RepJimmyPanetta of proposed #FarmBill

MN's Rick Nolan deriding the process of 2018 #FarmBill - "We were denied opportunity" to sit down. "Lots easier to write a bill in a back room somewhere ... but this bill shortchanges millions of people."
Peterson - I cannot guarantee a single vote from my caucus on this language, not just because of SNAP, but all of it. "You reap what you sow" #FarmBill
Peterson - But it isn't just SNAP. No baseline for animal disease prevention, organic research initiative or beginning farmer and rancher development programs. No funding for scholarships, eliminated Rural Energy for America Program, kills energy title. #FarmBill
Peterson - "I didn't walk way. We didn't walk away. We were pushed away by an ideological fight I repeatedly warned the chairman not to start." #FarmBill
Peterson - Either Chairman Conaway has chosen not to negotiate, or he was told by his leadership not to negotiate on one of the most significant parts of the #FarmBill
Peterson on #FarmBill - House Ag Committee chairman told me he "wouldn't jam me on SNAP, and yet here we are"

We’re wrapping up the forum - very good reaponses from lawmakers, and very respectful audience.
Number 1 concern coiced by audience today was Mental Health funding
Sen. Mathis attended hearing, says it was clear that those pushing bill were more interested in challenging Roe than making a policy that’s good for #Iowa
Rep. Hinson says she relies on advice from her citizen’s advisory committee; doesn’t believe this bill, as written, is science-based and that she would likely be a no vote.
Sen. Dan Zumbach says he has not signed on to the bill, doesn’t know if it will come up but that it is a topic worthy of dicussion.
Next question concerns the fetal heartbeat bill that is advancing in #IAlegis and would prohibit abortion once a fetal heartbeat is detected
Sen. Liz Mathis says this is multi-layered problem that needs addressing on multiple fronts.
Rep. Liz Bennett says don’t believe the hype and NRA framing that this American-centric problem is only due to mental health - nation needs commonsense gun regulations too.
Rep. Ashley Hinson notes her to young children, says school safety is a priority. Brings up recent FBI failings, says something should be dine because ppl are speaking up and being ignored.
Sen. Dan Zumbach tells story of 7th grader at small school that brought shot gun to school in preparation for hunting trip, facilitated by school staff. Says guns aren’t problem, ppl are. (Lots of audience grumbling in response)
Sen. Rob Hogg would like more focus to be on victims, and also highlights bills still pending at Statehouse that would further loosen gun regulations.
Rep. Todd Taylor brings up #Iowa cuts to #MentalHealth services, says he’s still exploring but knows atate is falling ahort, needs changes.
Many audience-submited Qs in relation to gun laws in the wake of the Florida mass shooting. Why do ppl need guns like AR15s? Do lawmakers support background checks? Etc
1st question - How to build a multi-generation workforce? Many lawmakers lamenting cuts to community colleges, changes to state laws that impact workers, like teachers.

The best news to come out of this #IAlegis session -- they've adjourned sine die.

RT @TechnologyIowa: #PrometheusAwards Mobile App of the Year - @HigherLearnTech. Congrats! https://t.co/nkAadYIlQM
So, let's be clear: #IAlegis has produced a pro-birth bill. There is nothing pro-woman, pro-human, pro-family - much less pro-life in it.
That last highlight section is to make sure parents can't avoid this scenario due to subsequent anxiety, depression, etc. from the trauma
That means parents hoping to avoid prolonged suffering could be forced into minutes, hours, days of watching their child die.
Other procedure is induction, which would also not meet this standard. So, we're looking at childbirth, without meds that cross placenta

Those court rulings were the basis for many cities, counties adopting separation policies and being labeled as sanctuary jurisdictions
Secure Communities failed largely due to fed court decisions that "detainers" violated the 4th Amendment #immigration
Under Secure Communities ppl had to be held 48 hours in local jails (at local expense) if ICE requested detainer #immigration
Under Secure Communities thousands of legal residents were erroneously detained #Immigration
Also, Secure Communities was an unfunded federal mandate, to the tune of about $1 Billion each year. #immigration
2nd Exec order hints new regulations may be assigned to reincarnated administrative program Secure Communities
2nd Trump #immigration exec order re-establishes Secure Communities, which does not deputize local law enforcement, hampers local goodwill
1st Trump #immigration exec order relies on voluntary 287(g) agreements known to deplete local resources, lead to racial profiling https://t.co/EDEoY298dW

My opinion: DNC appears willing to white wash historical significance of this moment in attempt to keep peace, and it won't work.
My opinion: am not convinced anything short of handing nomination to Sanders would be acceptable to some Sanders delegates. #DemsInPhilly
Sanders delegates felt disenfranchised because they were not included in team that made roll call vote response #IADemsInPhilly
Want to stress that based on what I've learned from talking with other state delegates, Iowa process has been very open, accomodating.
A few Sanders delegates - 2 or 3 - have spoken to the full group, afterward at least 2 walked out of this meeting #IADemsInPhilly
The strong emotions remain on display this morning at the breakfast meeting. #IADemsInPhilly
Also worth noting that a few #iowa Sanders delegates began to wear buttons, etc. supporting Hillary Clinton #IADemsInPhilly

The spirit of @HillaryClinton cookie comment has made an appearance at #Iowa breakfast as we move back to voting. #DemConvention

I'm told that more are supposed to open, but for now delegates say they're waiting in line for an hour. #DNCinPHL #DemsInPhilly
More logistical difficulties @DemConvention - only a couple of food vendors open in @WellsFargoCtr - lines out the wazoo.
Listen up. @BernieSanders no longer has control. He has asked his supporters not to protest, disrupt. Some don't care.
"I am respectful of you. I want you to be respectful of me. We are all Democrats and we need to act like it." Seems to have settled things
Rather large agitator group concentrated in far stage right section. Chairwoman Fudge having a difficult time maintaining control.

Looking at contested races, Robins had lowest turnout in Linn Co with 270 of 2527 possible ballots cast, or 10.7% participation.
Tiny Prairieburg in Linn Co had 57.5% turnout, 69 of 120 voters participated.
Some Linn Co turnout: CR Council 16-18% - CR library levy 16.2% - Fairfax 12% - Hiawatha 21.6% - Marion 19.2% - Mt Vernon 25% - Palo 6.3%
@LJYanney Of that slate, she was the one that surprised me; hard to dethrone an incumbent. She must have burned miles of shoe leather.
@jbonewald Darn it; keep hitting wrong key! It's is sad, library serves so many.
@jbonewald CR library levy was defeated, 55% no to 45% yes
@jbonewald The one tonight in CR or possible future one in Marion?
Ignore my earlier tweet on Marion Ward 3 - Lammers in final count was edged out by Will Brandt, who had 50.27% of votes.

Final Marion race was at-large, where Paul Draper easily defeated his 104 write-in opponents and garnered 97.34% of vote.
@desmoinesdem Lammers made some blunt remarks about fire pits, caught on video &amp; widely circulated on social media by opponent
Incumbent Kim Etzel has comfy 11-point win in Marion Ward 3 vs. slate member Dwight Hogan.
Nick AbouAssaly garners 45% to John Neilsnd's 37% in Marion mayor race; Joe Spinks, who tried to claim middle ground, pulls 16%
Three-person Marion slate gets 1 elected; former councilwoman Kay "douse the fire pit" Lammers returns.
Ward 1 Marion currently favoring incumbent Etzel to Hogan by 3%; in Ward 3 slate member Lammers leads 55 to 44%
Jury still out on Marion slate. John Nieland and Nick AbouAssaly running close (42 &amp; 43%) in Mayor race with 4/15 precincts in.
@jcauditor Rick Dobyns &amp; Michelle Payne, both incumbents, right?
Big message sent in Iowa City tonight with entire progressive slate elected; two incumbents sent home.
Looks like Pauline Taylor will take Dust A seat from incumbent Dobyns
Only IC17 (City High) remains: @Throg4IC in for 1 at-large seat; @rocknecole at 50%
Nearly half of #iowacity precincts in, still Cole &amp; Throg in at-large, Taylor in Dist A, Thomas in Dist C
As expected, closest #iowacity council race is in Dist C - 52% to 47% with Thomas holding narrow lead.

That's it for me; meet and greet time.
Instead of closing agencies, Carson says change what they do. For instance have Dept of Ed monitor schools for political bias
We need to make it possible for government employees to be fired, says Carson
Your plan to reduce national debt? "Need balanced budget amendment; to run gov like a business" says Carson
1st question: How is your health? "Good"
rt for typo : We have to concentrate on having everyone feel like they are a part of our system, says @RealBenCarson
We have to contrate on having everyone feel like the are a part of our system, says @RealBenCarson
We have to get rid of all deductions and loopholes, says Carson, of tax code. Advocates for #FlatTax
We have to stand up for our #faith and what we believe, says Carson, who adds pundits that label him a theocrat are "full of crap"
And @RealBenCarson advocates for people to rise up and take back control of gov (a la Jefferson)
This nation was designed around ppl, not around the government, says Carson, Constitution was to keep gov from infringing on people
We need to be shooting for things that require less government in our lives says @RealBenCarson
No Dem or GOP debate, says Carson. Not conservative vs liberal - the debates we face are American or anti-American
"Proveyers of Division" says Carson are intent on keeping American people divided
What happens to pur safety if police have to consider that they might be prosecuted? asks Carson
Carson says some are trying to drive wedge between communities and the police. Touts need for early childhood intros to local officers
Very important that we in America support the police, says Carson. The only thing between us and total chaos
Even for a youngster like me, growing up in poverty in the inner city, this country was a place of hope, says Carson

So @HillaryClinton 2008 lost Iowa largely on her war stance. @HillaryClinton 2016 enters the race with a video about people, but no veterans
@LJYanney She was personable, warm, human. But as campaign progressed, that first impression, if you will, was dwarfed. So, color me cynical
@LJYanney Maybe old skepticism at work. Met @HillaryClinton during her 1st official 2007 visit; wasn't expecting to be impressed, but was.

@DaveMc99TA yeah, I know, but worth noting it was typical. Cedar has 16 precincts, primary function of off-yr caucus is to elect leaders
@DaveMc99TA crowd in Cedar Co. was very typical (if not a bit better) of off-year caucus in smaller county. About 30 people by my count.
Former Gov. O'Malley shaking hands, signing books in Cedar County #Iowa http://t.co/I3cazTTGYh
Need to embrace shift in education, including higher ed, says O'Malley. 4th yr of HS could be revamped so kids grad with skill &amp; degree
O'Malley has solid record on unions, wastes no time highlighting it. Some in audience sit a little straighter. Obvious some don't know him.
This audience member concerned about jobs, mentoring &amp; declining unions. http://t.co/RHefBemsiD
Have to talk about jobs and opportunities available in clean energy future, says O'Malley.
We need to craft an American jobs agenda that matches this climate challenge, he says.
I'm told wind power in #iowa is a bipartisan issue, O'Malley says, wants to know if that is true. Was not necessarily case in MD.
Audience wants to know about envirnmental, people costs of energy production. Fracking &amp; possible oil pipelines in #iowa mentioned.
USa has more tools at its disposal than military, O'Malley says, speaks of need for "moral leadership" esp. In terms of climate change.
During Q&amp;A, O'Malley hit on perceived weakness, foreign policy.
My thought is that O'Malley needs to do more kitchen table events &amp; hone his voice to message. Not much passion; too much wonk.
This is typical O'Malley stump speech, audience attentive, but doesn't look inspired.
"That's not how our economy is supposed to work," O'Malley says.
Jobs are growing, but wages declining, says O'Malley. Corporate influence has gone too far.
O'Malley touting past accomplishments in Baltimore &amp; state of Maryland, says progressive economic policies proven success.
Martin O'Malley has arrived in Cedar County #Iowa http://t.co/0SKerceZas

With so much feedback from #Iowa veterans, I might need to do follow-up on today's column. http://t.co/c0jO5tWnDO http://t.co/4ojS1hhVAR
Will watch for #Iowa #gun bill &amp; let you know if it addresses mandated firearm safety courses, which are now a farce.
On more personal note, was told after #IAlegis forum that bill should be ready this week to address disparities in #Iowa #gun law. Bout time
Last speaker advocates for #MoveToAmend - would like #IAlegis to pass resolution to advocate to feds.
No state oversight in #Iowa speaker says for federally sanctioned dog breeders, wants support of bill that would change.
Swisher Mayor brings discussion back to #CleanWaterIowa - notes his town has no municipal water supply, integrity critical to such towns.
Next speaker invites lawmakers to attend local #BlackLivesMatter meetings.
Not familiar with #k12 assessment switch discussions? Pick up Sunday Gazette, @GazetteInsights breaks it down.
Staying on education topic, next speaker takes up possible switch in #k12 assessments.
If you want to make your voice heard within ed conference committee, have a parent or constituient from lawmakers home districts reach out.
Mascher says if CEOs gather in DSM &amp; say that education funding is critical; may make difference to business-focused #IAhouse
Rep. Sally stutsman says she does not understand disconnect between want of economic development &amp; lack of support for schools.
Current speaker, a local teacher, discusses the needs k12 schools fulfil, asks lawmakers to make funding a priority.
As one citizen speaks and returns to seat, another gets in comment line. We may be here awhile.
Should state have supplemental state aid for early childhood education?
Discussion has moved to early education, hard sell with squabbling over K12 funding.
"We have raging incrimentalism" in Des Moines, says Dvorsky.
Kinney gives kudos to @AdamBSullivan for his advocacy, "you have helped to change" my viewpoint.
Jacoby says he understands things move slowly, but slow is still progress on criminal justice reform.
If state can't move forward with necessary reforms, loosen reins and allow local authorities to do so.
And @AdamBSullivan discusses reduced penalty for marijuana posession - we need criminal justice reform, prohibition not working
Speaker says many bills offer piecemeal approach to long term care, lawmakers need to advocate for comprehensive approach.
Just opened floor to citizen questions, quite a line already. http://t.co/NvzQQx89XW
Elections have consequences, says Kaufmann, and voters elected lawmakers that aren't prone to raising tax twice in 1 session.
It has been more than 4 yrs since 63% of Iowans passed constitutional amendment to set up environmental trust fund, still no funding.
Jacoby doesn't see trust fund moving forward at all; too many obstacles &amp; #GasTax already done.
Says Kaufmann, only way to move forward w/ 3/8-cent sales tax for #environmental trust fund is to couple w/ income tax cut
@JoeStutler well, I'm not going to say that.
Lots of discussion on water quality, lots of tip-toeing around affects of agriculture.
Kaufmann on Branstad veto: should have been done with surgical precision, not chain saw.
Rep. Mary Mascher says nutrient reduction strategy is great, but underfunded. (Yep, @TerryBranstad veto has been brought up today)
@JoeStutler kinney said he had reservations of "technical aspects" of bill; guessing due to his time in law enforcement.
Q: what is #Iowa water quality? Dvorsky: we don't know, we aren't monitoring as we should. Might see bill to address, need a baseline.
Kinney says he supported spirit of bill, but took issue with logistics
Rep. Kevin Kinney talks #medicalmarijuana - specifically his committee no vote on reduced penalties for posession of 5 grams or less
Rep. Bobby Kaufmann talks eminent domain, says he is working on bill to combat Rock Island Clean Line #RICL and similar.
Iowa Sen. Bob Dvorsky notes K12 funding is in conference, hopeful it will move above House figure of 1.25 %
At #IAlegis forum in Coralville this morning, Dave Jacoby says there needs to be a plan before #Iowa MHIs are shutdown.

"Wherever the bird with no feet flew, she found trees with no limbs." Still missing you, Audre Lorde.
And we are wrapping up here in @northliberty - thanks, as always, for the conversation. There is a cookie in the foyer with my name on it.
Personal note: As a working Mom who likes to be active in community, so good to see child care offered at this forum.
God doesn't see our color, he sees what is in our hearts, says Paz.
Small things show the love of God through our lives, can change our communities, says Paz.
It is really nice to be able to ask a sincere question about how we can help each other without worry of offending, says Dubois.
Dubois says many of us want to learn more about different cultures, and we should keep conversation going, encourage curiousity.
Also, if not playing poker, please, please call &amp; invite police officer to community events, says Chief Venenga.
Law enforcement always changing, we will work to make sure our officers have latest tools &amp; info for inclusion, says Chief Venenga
1st off, we can all start by saying, "hi!" to each other, says @northliberty Police Chief Venenga. Let's be welcoming.
Spend the time now to design the community you want, urges @ChadDSimmons1 - put energy into it now so you have less consternation later
A goal is to get info to people in the way that best suits them, says @ChadDSimmons1 - encourage residents to run for school board, office
"In Chicago, if someone grabs your grocery cart like that, they are stealing your groceries."
Lots of laughter as folks from larger cities describe their shock the first time a worker at Fareway grabbed their grocery cart.
Panelist Shields says before audience leaves, everyone introduce themselves to one person they don't already know. It starts with one step
Moderator @LyleMuller moves group into "What Next?" point of discussion.
Speaker says @northliberty parents, community needs to send unified message to @IowaCitySchools regarding transportation &amp; safety
Next speaker brings up the topic of education; specifically current concerns about busing and transportation
@DougWagner Some say community IDs help in communities with immigrant population, help with reporting of crimes against that community
Speaker encourages community to have more events, get people to come out together. Don't wait for 1 national night out, have them often
"We need to break the barrier; understand we all have the same feelings because we are all human." says woman.
Spanish-speaking woman describes how she has developed relationships, even with others who only speak English.
Next speaker is woman speaking in Spanish, says she had a difficult time adjusting to the American culture.
@DougWagner Usually it something produced by city and/or county with less strict standards than what is needed for a state ID
@DougWagner Hard to explain in 140 characters; each community handles differently. Some tie to discounts with local merchants
@DougWagner @ChadDSimmons1 Doug, Chad was addressing a question about myths in the community, not stating as fact.
@PaulDeaton_IA My pleasure. Don't get to live tweet as often as I'd like.
@DougWagner It is an identification that is specific to a community.
.@ChadDSimmons1 notes that ppl can get Spanish or niche radio stations nationally, but when they don't exist locally, local info not shared
Are there events or other things in place in @northliberty that are brining people together? Audience says schools, Blues &amp; BBQ
Fellow from Shelter House (Iowa City) sounds warning bell that @northliberty will need to provide infrastructure for population, poverty
Differences should not be used against us, says @ChadDSimmons1 - community IDs allow us to treat each other with respect.
Next speaker advocates for community ID - important to proclaim you are part of this community.
@PaulDeaton_IA Did I mistype? Tina Dubois is executive director of NL Food and Clothing Pantry.
@LarryKness Her name is Sebrena - local resident, she works with NL families, but not I'm not sure of exact occupation
And @ChadDSimmons1 addresses myth that all new black people in community are poor and from Chicago. (One that I hear quite often.)
Chief Venenga says she is often asked why police stop woman each day as she walks to work. "Haven't been able to corroborate it."
Panelists were asked to address myths in the community. Should be good.
We need to have a common definition so that we can understand, make goals and move forward, says speaker.
Next speaker wants to know how people on panel &amp; in audience define diversity. What does it mean to you?
Panelist Shields suggests more communication between police and community members for understanding when stops are made.
Officers and I want this to be a welcoming community, says Chief Venenga. If that isn't happening, she wants to know.
From @ChadDSimmons1 - People here, in NY &amp; in MO are saying, "We want to have a different relationship with the police in our communities."
Woman says, I want my sons to feel safe. We are here &amp; we are vested; I'm willing to do whatever it is I can.
Moving to Q&amp;A portion of program. First speaker is very emotional woman, mom of three. Has felt targeted, says has been incidents.
I want to improve our community, avoid tragedies like what happened in #Ferguson says Paz. Showing love to each other we can be better.
No matter who we are, where we come from, we should explore how we can establish bridges between us, says Paz.
1st United Methodist Church lay minister Omar Paz is the final panelist &amp; discussing his work with local immigrants, his path to #Iowa
There is value in recognizing that we are all the same, says Dubois, also value in recognizing that we are all different.
Interesting listening to panelists speak as their words are immediately being translated into Spanish - almost like an echo.
There is a sense of community here, Dubois said, but pantry workers see divide between rural &amp; urban.
Poverty is a cultural difference you can't always see, that crosses all boundaries, says panelist Tina Dubois of local food pantry
Officers want @northliberty for quality of life. Hiring best people for jobs, but also w/ eye on diversity, says Venenga
.@northliberty police chief Diane Venenga talks about youth of community &amp; her department; says it brings so many opportunities.
#iowans compete not only nationally, but with world, says @ChadDSimmons1 http://t.co/9YUgc71UP7
Next panelist is @ChadDSimmons1 of @DiversityFocus - not a resident, but wants to talk about importance of @northliberty for region.
Shields says @northliberty needs more diverse housing; lower income pockets more spread out throughout community.
.@northliberty resident Sebrena Shields is 1st panelist to speak. Says she came to town 13 yrs ago, talks about how she was welcomed
Moderator, BTW, is former @gazettedotcom staffer @LyleMuller - now with @IowaWatch
To give idea on how important this type of discussion has become, there are 3 television stations covering the forum tonight.
Forum getting underway in @northliberty http://t.co/yaIvTFbyMu
Forum getting unerway http://t.co/unIwt0mlrA
North Liberty has had a population explosion in recent years, with many new residents being more diverse than longer term residents.
So, unlike forums in other areas, this discussion isn't born of crisis or existing tensions, but meant to be proactive.
As background: forum was created after a sermon by Rv. Alecia Williams. She said the community needed to start talks on racial diversity.
At the diversity meeting in North Liberty; hoping there might be some opportunities for live tweets tonight. We'll see.
