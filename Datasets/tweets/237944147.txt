This deal is under Congressional authority to review &amp; I will only support if it meets the benchmark of forever preventing a nuclear Iran
Information I feel is vital to the Admin., Congress and American ppl when reviewing any agreement with Iran that includes sanctions relief.
Nxt wk, the Task Force to Investigate Terrorism Financing will take a closer look at Iran’s role in financing terror groups around the world
And have unapologetically continued their state sponsorship of terrorism.
Even during negotiations, Iranian leaders have spewed hateful language towards the United States, Israel and the Jewish people
Or that the Iranian regime is truly committed to joining the international community.
While I support all diplomatic efforts to promote peace &amp; cooperation, there is little reason to believe deal will halt Iran’s nuc. program
