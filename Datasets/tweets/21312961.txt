@RepAdamSmith says, "We are going to be a major major player, probably the major player on the global stage for some time to come. We are going to be very powerful, but we are not going to be utterly and completely dominant" as we were in the 1950's and 1960's

Lt. Gen. Mark D. Kelly says "Our adversaries don’t sit still so we can’t sit still … We have to keep pace with that. The only way we can be confident using it or in an outright kinetic warfight is training with it." #DNConf
The synthetic training environment is important says Maj. Gen. Maria Gervais because it allows warfighters to fight on the terrain they will face, with their own equipment, and give them the reps they need. She says we are witnessing the second revolution in training #DNConf

How to sum up #NATOSummit? Members are eager to reinforce unity, but experts caution that money needs to be put where the mouths are in order to credibly deter threats. Russia remains a big focus, and terrorism is an endless but important threat as well. @AtlanticCouncil #NATO
"Many of the tools threats to NATO use often don't fire shots, but target institutions and democracies"		Laura Rosenberger of German Marshall Fund at @AtlanticCouncil #NatoSummit
NATO should broaden sights and be open to assisting democratic partners in Asia in the face of powerful China, says Vershbow @AtlanticCouncil #NATOSummit
Helping partners in Middle East better helps NATO by teaching the area to "tackle threats in their own neighborhood" and address the underappreciated threats to the South for Europe, say Vershbow and State Department's Michael Murphy #NatoSummit
Mass migration and failed states on Europe's periphery rising threat to NATO security as it provides base for terrorism #NATOSummit
Why did this Iraqi army brigade swap its American Abrams tanks for Russian ones? https://t.co/amXC0AqqeH https://t.co/J1lllIEWek
Both "hybrid and cyber" threats must be included in the types of threats to prepare for and to be deterred by NATO, according to panel experts at our final panel here at #NATOSummit

Rep. Ruben Gallego (D-AZ-7), Armed Services Committee, claims there is "deep support" for NATO on the Hill across party lines, with strong unity in Congress on the threat of Russian aggression #NATOSummit
"Security can only be guaranteed by credible military forces. Under-funding deterrence puts our NATO family at risk" says Rep Turner, comparing defense spending like locking your front door at night to be safe #NATOSummit
It's time for Europeans to dedicate themselves to American security just like how America has dedicated itself to European security, says Rep. Turner. This comes in the form of defense budget spending and NATO contributions #NATOSummit
"Why do we have to increase our defense spending? We're in NATO!"		Rep. Turner recounts some flawed logic he has overheard before in NATO parliaments, but celebrates a more recent return to a mentality that each member's contributions matter for deterrence #NATOSummit
Rep. Turner is a big fan of returning to a "deterrence mentality" in NATO, highlighting reemergence of adversaries that question credibility of defense commitments of members #NATOSummit
The folks from the Hill are here to put in their two cents on #NATO too, @AtlanticCouncil now hosting Rep Michael Turner (OH-10), Head, US Delegation to the NATO Parliamentary Assembly #NATOSummit

New sub-launched nuke clears congressional hurdle https://t.co/T9oaGBfhLk https://t.co/PAtJKEApcw
For Estonia's Vseviov, it would be a "grave mistake" to assume security is a project that can ever be considered permanently solved, echoing Baltic view of ongoing security threats and need for cohesion as alliance #NATOSummit
Presence of allied members forces in Baltics is "backbone, cornerstone" of credibility of NATO deterrence to neighbor #Russia says Vseviov at #NATOSummit @AtlanticCouncil
Speaking of Baltics...Jonatan Vseviov of Estonian Ministry of Defense notes that Estonia gets the "biggest bang for their buck" for defense spending and NATO contributions, investing efficiently and often in defense measures #NATOSummit

What will US say to Turkey at NATO summit about missiles-"it is not helpful, it poses technical risks, our preference is that they do not acquire S-400" from DoD's Goffus at the #NATOSummit
Despite drama in headlines from G-7 leader summit, Goffus explains NATO defense officials focused on defense issues and are working together well at recent meeting #NATOSummit @AtlanticCouncil
NATO "can't focus on single threat"		Southern Flank of Spain, Portugal, Italy, Greece worried about borders 	Eastern Flank worried about Russian action		From DoD's Goffus at #NATOSummit @AtlanticCouncil
"Necessary but not sufficient" says DoD's Goffus of current conditions of contributions of NATO allies to missions and defense budgets #NatoSummit @AtlanticCouncil
Unity of #NATO members is "top priority" for the DoD secretary, as credibility of deterrence depends on it #NATOSummit
Make #NATO Ready Again?		We need to "bring a culture of readiness back" to NATO, DoD offical Goffus notes at #NatoSummit

"Nations with allies thrive, nations without allies wither"	--Thomas Goffus, DoD deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for Europe and NATO #NATOSummit
After that "optimistic note"....jokes Lithuanian DM Karoblis in a baritone Eastern European accent...everyone is ready to work with NATO on security concerns for Baltics #NATOSummit
Until #NATO fixes "gaps" in forces and defense abilities, United States is the single "most capable ally" to help Baltics in case of attack according to Karoblis #NATOSummit
#NATO forces could be "too little, too late" to help Baltic nations in case of attack, warns DM Karoblis. Russia is "bolstering" military abilities for action #NATOSummit @AtlanticCouncil
The Baltics are the most "vulnerable members" of #NATO says Lithuanian DM Karoblis, and #NATO must return attention to strengthening "Eastern Flank" #NATOSummit @AtlanticCouncil
#NATO summit this summer must send "unwavering message of unity" to Russia and other onlookers #NATOSummit from Karoblis
Allowing a deepening split between US and Europe weakens NATO, says Lithuania's DM #NATOSummit
H.E. Raimundas Karoblis, Republic of Lithuania Minister of National Defense, says "as far as Baltics are concerned, US and NATO involvement in the Baltic region is of paramount importance" #NATOSummit
Key question #NATO members will ponder this summer: how to project unity and deter aggression with "Russia prowling the neighborhood"? says Damon Wilson, @AtlanticCouncil #NATOSummit
Excited to kick off a great discussion of what's on the mind of #NATO members here at Raising the Curtain on the 2018 NATO Brussels Summit! @AtlanticCouncil #NatoSummit
