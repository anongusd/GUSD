@WildFlowerSeed_ @BryceHarperCub1 @KOB76 @JeffPassan Attacked!?!
@WildFlowerSeed_ @RobbbMart @JeffPassan Will do. Thanks!
@jaketapper @Boris_Sanchez @TheLeadCNN People outraged at Trump? Boy, this is news. Keep at it, Mr. Tapper. I'm sure you'll stumble into some actual news at some point.
@KOB76 @JeffPassan Falling off, or being dragged out of, a chair is something that is frightening. I wouldn't say otherwise. But let's not given women a free pass. I've gotten 2 black eyes in my life, both from women. We're men, we don't give a fuck, we move on. That's why you never hear about it.
@chgotolv @mo__con @jdawsey1 You know what they say about opinions.
@RobbbMart @JeffPassan By the way, who hasn't fallen out of a chair? It's not a big deal. Today's people are so soft. Call me when you take a punch to the face or gut or something that actually hurts.
@JeffPassan He was clearly trying to grab whatever papers she was holding. Not saying this excuses the behavior, but it omits important context. "Video shows Baer grabbing for documents in his wife's hands and dragging her from her seat" != "he knocked her to the ground".
@darrenrovell @DrinkBODYARMOR PT Barnum was right. You're a fucking idiot if you buy this garbage. Drink water. It's free.
@jaketapper Iran Contra happened. ? was, did Reagan know? Same thing with MBS and CK. And it's just near-impossible to prove these things. Best you can usually say is "they must have known", but that's not the same as "I'm 100% sure".
@jaketapper The reaction was "Trump gave North Korea a pass". That's not true, not literally anyway. He gave Kim a pass for not knowing about it. Probably not true, but blaming the country is not the same as blaming the leader. You need only look at Iran Contra to find a domestic example.
@KatyTurNBC @realDonaldTrump We want more isolation? Double down on that? I didn't vote for him, but I'll say this for Trump: he's trying something different. There's an argument to be made that he's purposely downplaying their involvement as a face-saving mechanism.
@KatyTurNBC @realDonaldTrump Is it a good idea for Trump not to blame MBS/Kim? Probably not, because they probably knew. On the other hand, when you're dealing with guys like them, what works? The world's mostly isolated NK and that's resulting in them being a nuclear threat.
@KatyTurNBC @realDonaldTrump We believe it's likely (or highly likely, or whatever) MBS/Kim would have had to know about these things. That's not proof. Reagan probably would have had to know about Iran Contra, but he said he didn't and we had to take him at his word absent corroborating evidence.
@KatyTurNBC @realDonaldTrump Jesus Christ. He clearly blamed North Korea. He's just saying Kim denied knowing about it and he takes him at his word. Did Kim know? Unless we've intercepted communication confirming he knew, all we can do is make an educated guess. Same with MBS. Intel can say this:
@mo__con @jdawsey1 But we made it through that. If we can't make it through this, it won't be because of Trump. It'll be because the current set of Americans just wasn't up to snuff. Until there's a draft and you're getting shot at Bastogne or Da Nang, it's not even close.
@mo__con @jdawsey1 Bullshit. It just isn't. This generation would do well to look at REAL crises in history - like, I don't know, 6 million Jews being systematically exterminated - and realize this is orders of magnitude less.
@mo__con @jdawsey1 This is why millennials are the worst. They're desperate to be part of a movement, so much so that they gin up drama so they can be Han Solo &amp; Princess Leia fighting the Empire. And that's the exact narrative the media is pushing. Oh, it's so terrible. Oh, it's unprecedented.
@mo__con @jdawsey1 I didn't say it was nothing. What I'm saying is: perspective. No country's ever been perfect. This notion that somehow this is an unprecedented moment is IMHO utter narcissism. We've been through far worse. This generation just has a desperate need to feel like they matter.
@cnni This has to be The Onion, right? Possession of a stolen gun in your lap when you're passed out (one wonders if he was intoxicated) and blocking the drive through. Is there any behavior we won't excuse? Anyone responsible for themselves or is it all society's fault?
@mo__con @jdawsey1 Calm down. Everything's fine. I cannot believe the utter narcissism of today's American. We survived two World Wars, the Great Depression, Vietnam, etc. That was the real deal. This is nothing compared to that. Have some faith in your country.
@Tedratuslumborm @SenGillibrand Also, she didn't say women's history is *a part of* American history, but that it *is* American history. In effect, that's saying that men are all assholes who don't deserve to be a part of American history.
@Tedratuslumborm @SenGillibrand The implication is that men held women down. Also, let's be honest, it's more or less known that's the Dem playbook, what with "toxic masculinity" and "rape culture" and other such nonsense.
@mo__con @jdawsey1 You already know the answer to that. It would be a pointless gesture. Congress is there to get shit done, not making pointless gestures.
@SenGillibrand Good luck winning the WH when you're tacitly attacking half the country.
@mo__con @jdawsey1 Dems can't impeach Trump themselves.
@jdawsey1 You can think that's ridiculous, and it probably is, but semantically, it is a different thing. Sort of like Iran-Contra; Reagan technically gets blame because he ran the country, but he maintained he didn't know about it.
@jdawsey1 Didn't he say he didn't blame Kim? If so, there's a distinction between that and blaming the country as a whole. Sort of like the Kashoggi thing - no question the Saudis did it, but on whose order? Same here - as with him believing MBS didn't know, he thinks Kim didn't know.

@Djtrujillo10 @jimsciutto No. No. I don‚Äôt know what that means. At worst, this makes Trump guilty of failing to report something he had no way of stopping. You can hate him all you want. My point is: this doesn‚Äôt change the current calculus. Who‚Äôs going to change their minds on this basis? I submit no1.
@BobSimms1978 @jimsciutto Not in a meaningful way. First, failure to report is very different from having an active role. Second, what would he do? No one‚Äôs been able to stop Assange from releasing info.
@CBSNews Wait.... it‚Äôs not Sandals West? Gosh. This is a real wake-up call.
@beach_hermit @jimsciutto How so? As I read it, Stone learned that Assange was planning to release information that would hurt the Clinton campaign. What‚Äôs that do? Wouldn‚Äôt Assange have released them anyway?
@jimsciutto But if they can‚Äôt prove Trump ordered Stone to do it... does it matter? And wouldn‚Äôt Assange have released them anyway? I don‚Äôt see how this testimony moves the needle in any meaningful way.
@jimsciutto How does this do anything? Trump being aware Stone did something != ordering him to do it.
@SethDavisHoops Here‚Äôs an idea: under 2 mins, refs have the ability to call a jump ball when they can‚Äôt tell who the ball went off of. No replays. Possession goes by standard jump ball rules.

@mslonsky @TrumpsTaxes @Acosta @FoxNews That's all "news media" today. It's hard to find anyone who reports without spin. CNN certainly falls into that category. 85% of their content is editorializing (i.e. telling you what to think). 15% is any sort of actual reporting. Fox News is worse.
@jdawsey1 BREAKING
@EaglesSuperfan @GottliebShow Bruised ego.
@SInow @ConorOrr He might get a token amount added on for show, so it could get reported as 3 yrs/$40MM so his agent can say it was more than DJ, but with zero guaranteed money beyond years 1-2 (yr 3 $20MM option which will be declined) it will basically be a 2 yr contract.
@SInow @ConorOrr What is he, Bell's agent? He's 4 years older than Gurley, and Gurley just laid a turd in the postseason. Johnson's not a comp, either, because it was an extension and he's not a head case. Sez here he'll get 2 yrs/$20MM/$10APY at most.
@ClancysDaddy @CNNPolitics And you're not biased in any way. Thanks for contributing nothing.
@INTJ_Minds @CNNPolitics Take that one of RM and this one of SS and it's a whole different look. Now he's the downtrodden one and she looks professional. Don't think that's accidental. CNN doesn't report. They tell you what to think. https://t.co/9sjzTE4clH
@INTJ_Minds @CNNPolitics You've got to be a dullard if you can't read the subtext. Why didn't they use this pic of Mueller? Because they love him. Why didn't they find another picture of SS? Because they hate her. https://t.co/JZpPgbjsXb
@Robinindfw @CNNPolitics Maybe not a pained grimace. I mean, seriously, do you not get the spin these images convey? Mueller looks like some sort of Christlike figure and SS looks awful. Whoever picks the pics wanted it that way. I'm sure they have a good pic. They're just choosing not to run it.
@CNNPolitics Are we sure that's the worst SS picture we can find? There's got to be one where she has nacho cheese on her face or something.
@MLB Anyone but the Rockies. Seriously, what happened in the 90's where every expansion team had teal and purple and so on in their colors?
@SenSchumer @realDonaldTrump What if he puts the Constitution into one of those Banksy frames, we put it up for auction, and it shreds itself once someone buys it?
@bomani_jones A settlement is a victory for the NFL. Only way they really, really lose is for the case to go to court. It's a victory for Kaep, as well. There really are no losers, other than the owners that lose a tiny chunk of their fortunes. This is why most cases like this are settled.
@MLB Not Marlins.
@NotSethMSouza @maggieNYT I'm not sure that's how it works. You don't consult a calendar to figure out the optimal day &amp; weather for gay bashing.
@Common_sense103 @maggieNYT Stars don't know all of the people on set. It was dark. They were likely wearing hoods/masks/whatever. Not exactly what you'd call an ideal situation to recognize someone you at best vaguely know.
@TrumpsTaxes @Acosta What does he believe about not constantly inserting himself into the stories he's covering? Any word on that? How about nonstop editorializing? News there?
@jdawsey1 Maybe the media can stop covering it as if it's some new thing. He is who he is. Running a million fact checks won't change anyone's mind. Either you're for him or against him. Move on to new content rather than continuing to mine the same story over and over and over.
@jdawsey1 At this point, anyone who takes anything POTUS says as the truth is just clueless. He's always telling a fish story. It has some relationship to the truth colored with all sorts of boasts, exaggeration, etc. That's who he is.
@ChrisVanHollen Calm down. People said Obama's DACA executive action was an unlawful power grab. We made it through that. Life goes on. Maybe try governing quietly rather than trying to make every petty disagreement the end of the world.
@ChrisRaab3 @maggieNYT I mean, think about it. What would Smollett's motive be for a hoax? What would he get out of it? Sympathy? Notoriety? And if he did, is he really going to be dumb enough to enlist coworkers? OTOH, it's easy to understand how these guys disliked him bc he's gay.
@ChrisRaab3 @maggieNYT I think the more likely explanation is these two guys were homophobic (Nigeria is very anti-gay) and did this to gay bash while trying to make it look like white Trump supporters were behind it. Occam's Razor. The explanation that requires the least explanation is right.
@booshie055 @maggieNYT The point is, it would be odd for a co-worker to be randomly involved in an attack against you. If a co-worker commits a crime against you, it's almost always because they know you, even if you don't know them.
@AdamHeat86 @amore20188 @maggieNYT Nigeria's amongst the most homophobic countries on earth. I bet they staged it to look racist in order to throw suspicion away from them. You can't really blame the media for making the logical leap. It's not every day you see a gay bashing disguised as a racial attack.
@maggieNYT True, these gents don't resemble the description Smollett gave, but that's not unusual. If it's dark, if they were wearing hooded jackets, it's not crazy to think he didn't get a great view and just assumed they were white since they were saying racist things to him.
@maggieNYT Nigeria is amongst the most homophobic countries on Earth. One possible explanation would be that these guys worked on Empire, decided to gay-bash Smollett, and tried to cover it up as a racial attack to shift suspicion away from themselves. That would mostly tie it all up.
@JeffPassan Teams are acting with perfect rationality. Big-ticket FAs only make sense when you're one of the, say, 10 teams with a realistic chance to win the World Series. Then you take it consideration fit - team has to have an opening - and degree of improvement.
@RapSheet Antonio Brown is a huge asshole.
@WSJ When are folks going to realize traveling to Russia or China is a terrible idea?
@SenWhitehouse @CVSHealth How about we let rational adults make their own decisions about what to put in their body rather than empowering a nanny state to decide for them what's best? Sounds crazy, I know, but perhaps just crazy enough to work.
@wojespn Take command? Reshape the team? What is this, some sort of plantation? Methinks Ms. Benson is unaware players run the league.
@AlbertBreer What does he care? Players run the league. He can pull his pants down in the middle of the court and it wouldn't matter.
@CBSNews Certainly this is more important than the city's homelessness crisis.
@darrenrovell I'll be anyone's pawn for $30MM a year.
@MattEhalt Expand the playoffs. That's how you get more teams to compete and spend $. Right now, it just isn't worth it unless you're one of the very best teams. 8 teams from each league, each 7 game series, and I guarantee you teams will spend.

@Daniel_Rapaport Restrictor plates.
@WesleyLowery But I guarantee you that won't happen. What will happen: heads in the sand. Pretend there's no problem, keep on making the punishment harsher, no one learns, and the beat goes on. Until we can look each other in the eye and be honest without fear of banishment, nothing changes.
@WesleyLowery ** go. Point being, political correctness is a varnish on top of a bad cord of wood. When we chill speech and thought, we don't fix the root cause. The way out is letting people be honest and not immediately then kicking them out of society for being honest.
@WesleyLowery You know how we deal with it? By being honest. And that's not what we're doing. Look at Liam Neeson. When anyone admits to that, they've got to do. I suggest the best way to heal is to STOP making this an exile-worthy offense and start being honest.
@mkraju Does it matter? @SpeakerPelosi is going to torpedo anything they come out with.
@MichaelEHuck @WesleyLowery He said the way to stop discrimination is not to discriminate, which isn't exactly the same.
@NewsHour @DanielBush Donald Trump not following a playbook? This is some fantastic reporting.
@NateSilver538 This is why the country's divided. Your snark only makes the other half hate you more. Maybe try not sneering down your nose at us.
@NateSilver538 Fuck you, Nate. Asshole.
@AbbieBlumberg @WesleyLowery @deray I was speaking generally. I don't know you. I wouldn't presume to make any statements about you. Pretty much everything I tweet is for the world and not directed at anyone in particular.
@AbbieBlumberg @WesleyLowery @deray That's basically what happened. The Northam stuff was released based on his statements about abortion. The rest was part of the feeding frenzy. Make no mistake - mining for dirt on opponents is now an accepted tactic.
@brithume THANK YOU! This is how Trump's #fakenews nonsense gets traction. When there's no clear delineation between reporting and op/ed, it starts to look like you're trying to tell readers what to think.
@HulaBernard @AbbieBlumberg @WesleyLowery @deray It is. I had dinner with my parents, who are both from SW Va, Monday night and we talked about all this. Minstrel shows, blackface, etc - very common. I'm not saying it was OK, but pretty much everyone felt it was OK at the time (white folks only, I suppose).
@831SuperStar @ABC It was Kurtis Blow.
@YoursTruly_ntf @ABC Virginians had slaves. Separate but equal, whites only, etc wasn't that long ago. I don't understand why people are shocked that a few decades ago white folks thought wearing blackface was OK. It'd be shocking if that weren't the case.
@YoursTruly_ntf @ABC You mean like being a part of the country that tried to secede, fought a war against the rest of the country, and is still resolving that centuries later? Yep. I'd say that qualifies as serious issues. The only surprising thing is that people find it surprising.
@Chrissys067 @ABC I think they all basically nullify each other and we go back to where we were.
@DrewSutton20 @ABC I guarantee you the GOP got to someone close to him. That's how this works. The Northam thing wasn't an accident. It was revenge for his comments on abortion. 100% getting out ahead of it.
@AbbieBlumberg @WesleyLowery @deray Or, not from the south. If you didn't grow up there, maybe this is shocking to you. But if you know anything about the south, I cannot imagine this is surprising to you.
@AbbieBlumberg @WesleyLowery @deray That's not to say you have to say it was OK, but I'm not sure people understand the scope of this. These are not isolated things. This was a fairly common thing at the time. If this is shocking to you, well, you were sheltered/uninformed.
@AbbieBlumberg @WesleyLowery @deray Why are you surprised? Jim Crow, separate but equal, etc wasn't all that long ago. Is it really surprising that a few decades after that people still thought it was OK to wear blackface? Methinks folks from outside the south just don't understand how commonplace it was.
@WesleyLowery You could kinda do that. There are a billion datacenters/exchange points/etc in Northern Va. Power cycle them all and who knows what could happen.
@PostSports "There's no o" will be uttered maybe tens of thousands of times.
@PostSports All I'm thinking is how many times the kid's going to have to correct the spelling of his name over his lifetime.
@MarkWilkbank @anradila17 @KellyannePolls @realDonaldTrump What's your position on the Hawley-Smoot tariff?
@bigcftw76 @maggieNYT Not to say it has to be viewed as acceptable, but I'm not sure people understand the scope of this. If blackface is the new litmus test, a whole lot of folks are going to be immediately disqualified from public office.
@bigcftw76 @maggieNYT No shit, I ate dinner with my parents Monday night and heard tell of all sorts of things. They're both from SW VA and believe you me, this sort of thing is WAY more common than most people currently believe.
@mattkleinkeys @CsCGrant @SenateDems @SenatorCarper @realDonaldTrump I was talking about additional money in my paycheck as a result of the tax cuts, not my year-end tax return. Tax cuts had a near-immediate effect on paychecks.
@bigcftw76 @maggieNYT Stay out of this, you yankee carpetbagger.
@maggieNYT I actually think everything's starting to clear up. Everyone can just say we all made mistakes and get back to work.
@Swerdlick I actually think this is a positive development. He's finally starting to become mildly presidential.
@SenSchumer Party of unity.
@mkraju Party of unity.
@LATimesfarmer Meanwhile it feels like spring going into summer here in Washington, DC.
@AP @airlinewriter Very positive development for frequent flyers.
@SenatorBennet Both sides pander to their base.
@SenSanders Party of unity.
@mkraju Least surprising news ever.
@WalkingDead_AMC Thinking how the show turned into garbage after you fired Frank Darabont.
@jimjester @BigOandDukes @chaddukes @oscarradio @drabtshirt @Twitch Thanks for the heads up JJ
@NewsHour No. What‚Äôs the point? Everyone‚Äôs on one side or the other and no one‚Äôs going to change their mind.
@NewsHour Lesson? Lie instead of being honest. Good stuff.
@baxter1967 @mewilliams9262 @SenateDems @realDonaldTrump Taxes will go up. That‚Äôs the point. It doesn‚Äôt matter how much. Virtually no one likes Uncle Sam taking more $ from them.
@SenateDems @SenatorCarper @realDonaldTrump I got $4,800 more dollars last year. Seems true to me.
@SenateDems @realDonaldTrump I thought you were the party of unity?
@meltreger @S_K_Patterson I'm gonna need him to ride in on a camel.
@PattyMurray Shouldn't we be pressuring both sides to come to an agreement?
@CNNPolitics What a dumbass.
@incelmo @JonnieBratwurst @ABC Maybe be a little more hyperbolic. I'm not getting your point.
@incelmo @JonnieBratwurst @ABC And no sane person can argue the party hasn't dramatically changed in my lifetime. The Democratic party used to be the one fighting for free speech. Now, it's the party that wants to silence speech if it hurts someone's feelings. It's the party of pity.
@incelmo @JonnieBratwurst @ABC I'm not intimidated. I'm just telling you what these choices mean. Democrats love to talk about lifting everyone up, of being the party of inclusion. That's doublespeak. While that's said out of one size of the party's mouth, the other is demonizing white men, corporations, etc.
@JonnieBratwurst @incelmo @ABC I have no party. The GOP sucks too. There is no sane centrist party. You've got crazy on both ends. By the way, I don't have many emotions. I'm a man. I'm not opining for people to feel sorry for me. My life's awesome. I'm just stating a set of facts.
@incelmo @JonnieBratwurst @ABC Awesome.
@incelmo @JonnieBratwurst @ABC I'm a Gen X'er, but OK.
@FieldYates I think they're going to change their mascot to Panama Jack.
@Dischef @coyototo @SenateDems Sorry. We'll go ahead and leave, then. Our bad.
@coyototo @SenateDems &lt;looks at Tweet&gt; Nope, didn't say anything about anyone other than myself. Please don't put words in my mouth.
@MarkWilkbank @anradila17 @KellyannePolls @realDonaldTrump Nixon was more or less thrown out of office in disgrace, but OK.
@JonnieBratwurst @incelmo @ABC As one Bob Dylan sang: "You don't need a weatherman/To know which way the wind blows". I'm just going with the wind and leaving a party that demonizes folks like me, what with my racism, sexism, rape culture, institutional racism, school to prison pipeline, and the like.
@JonnieBratwurst @incelmo @ABC You and I both know the Democratic party is tilting toward folks of color and women, with women of color being the middle of that Venn diagram and thus the new face of the party. As a white male, I know I'm not wanted in the party. That's all I'm saying.
@KamalaHarris @staceyabrams Is it historic because she lost her election and currently holds no elected office?
@SenateDems Economy's working well for me. I'm middle class. Also, my health care is great.
@ABC Can we have a few more women of color involved? Too few for my liking.
@SenSanders We can do both.
@CNNPolitics Anyone know the last time someone who's not currently in elected office gave the SOTU response? Have to imagine it's rare.
@LWPHarvard @joekennedy Moral Capitalism makes as much sense as Compassionate Conservatism.
@finebaum Belichick, because Saban recruits the most talented players in the country. Belichick has to build though the draft, almost always with the last or close to last pick of each round.
@darrenrovell Waste of a dollar.
@TheAtlantic @maggieNYT @aliaemily Move to the ‚Äòburbs.
@KenTremendous This is like when I take too much melatonin and have weird fever dreams.
@jeffpearlman Maybe Black folks are smart enough not to spend thousands of dollars on a game they show on TV.
@cbakerswaggy Plus his coat was amazing.
@SInow Season is really not hard to type.
@chaddukes I lost it when the giant 40 ouncer punched it in.
@KenTremendous Bloop single by Goff drives in Gurley in the bottom of the ninth.
@MillerLite Plus a rad logo.
@JormandBigCat @FootsNotleg @chaddukes @oscarradio @drabtshirt @BigOandDukes See you there Fancypants!
@BigOandDukes Tix bought.
@LindseyThiry @YahooForde Perhaps the lesson is: don‚Äôt spend big dollars on a RB.
@SInow This one was clever. They needed to burn that terrible Dilly Dilly campaign to the ground.
@Craneium @chaddukes Glad we have the @BigOandDukes halftime show on Facebook.
@NoahGarfinkel Christian Okoye in a video game could do it.
@J_No24 @NFL @sonofbum Wade is the man.
@MrChickSports @czabe He‚Äôs got that thirst.
@ngreenberg Rad.
@SInow No Chance I know who he is.
@BigOandDukes HOT ROUTE!
@Swerdlick Yes. It‚Äôs bubble-wrap on everyone.
@RobLowe It‚Äôs maddening. They‚Äôre killing the golden goose.
@Brett_McMurphy Maybe for waterheads.
@stephenasmith @RamsNFL @Patriots LA is a bad football town.

@BrittanySvoboda @Saints Ah yes, that picturesque march past the Hustler Club.
@chaddukes YAS! F Maroon 5. #LLTH
@czabe Make way for the privileged!
@NFL @TG3II @SuperBowl Christ. Wear a suit, man.
@SenCortezMasto @PattyMurray @SenateDems @BetsyDeVosED You mean women safe. Men get nothing out of it.
@darrenrovell Fortunately it‚Äôs on TV. Not sure if you heard.
@juliussharpe Blake was acquitted, if that matters at all.
@chaddukes @drabtshirt Please consider bringing the @snackandsoda show guys down from Grand Rapids next time @oscarradio misses the @BigOandDukes show, which should be fairly soon if history is any guide.
@JennyVrentas @theMMQB Camel is the best color for a coat and it‚Äôs not close.
@Reuters @onehitGit I can‚Äôt take a man wearing a quarter-zip sweater seriously.
@stephenfry Surpassed as a mixer only by Wink.
@ABC Former rapper.
@wojespn Nik Staskas being passed around like a joint at a Doobie Brothers concert during ‚ÄúChina Grove‚Äù.
@Reuters Half human, half robot - ALL BADASS!
@SenSanders To the victor go the spoils, which are then used to win again, and so on. Dialectical materialism at its best.
@OpieRadio @MIKEBOCCHETTI @Doritos You know a bit is funny when you‚Äôre LOLing and the sound is off.
@jaketapper Well said. Like all things, it‚Äôs not a zero sum game. We can both admire the ‚Äúpull yourself up by your bootstraps‚Äù Horacio Alger attitude while also questioning its impact on the country. Life‚Äôs complex.
@darrenrovell When it comes to death camps, cars, and snack stadiums, you just can‚Äôt beat ‚Äòem.
@pattonoswalt Global warming could stop murders!
@pattonoswalt Must have a generous shoe polish budget.
@Swerdlick Kudos to Schultz for at least offering an alternative to two awful parties. A choice between a bunch of neosocialists and Trump? Blech. We ought to have another option.
@Swerdlick Would they complain if, say, Mario Rubio could run as a third party candidate? Of course not. No problem, but stop trying to pretend you have the moral high ground. Dems will do anything to win, just like the GOP, no matter how incoherent the tactics.
@Swerdlick Dem position on this is first class nonsense. How many words are spilled about how important it is for the government to represent the people? Yet when Schultz wants to run, it‚Äôs bad because it hurts our party. Did they have any problem with Ross Perot?
@hwsmithca @jaketapper You‚Äôre going to limit it just to the Trail of Tears? We killed and drove them off their lands for, what, decades? Let‚Äôs not single Jackson out. The whole country was responsible.
@jaketapper Technically an aristocracy is a form of government where power is inherited. Few of the ultra-wealthy are in government. The General‚Äôs words may not be perfectly applicable to our current situation.
@JohnClaytonNFL Maybe the worst 4 hours in sports.
@jbarro @Swerdlick It‚Äôs the trade winds.
@ReutersSports @Reuters @SNkeats No thanks. It‚Äôs on TV.
This 5 layer dip must have warped in from ‚Å¶@Stranger_Things‚Å© https://t.co/gIMXrngFcY
@JayGlazer Want the @RamsNFL to win. Brady has enough titles. Rather see another team win.
@RobinD444 @CBSNews @yashar It‚Äôs because we‚Äôre causing it. Constant use of anti microbial wipes/lotions prevents kids‚Äô bodies from learning how to recognize bad things, so they attack good things like peanuts. + not exposing kids to peanuts and that‚Äôs where the allergies come from.
@Cheekyone45 @CBSNews Back then people didn‚Äôt constantly use anti-germ wipes and lotions. The body needs germs to learn what is and is not a threat. Overuse of those products means kids‚Äô bodies don‚Äôt get enough germs and the body starts attacking things like peanuts BC it thinks they‚Äôre bad.
@CBSNews So, expose kids to peanuts and stop with the constant use of anti-germ things and the problem will solve itself.
@CBSNews Why the incidence of these allergies is much lower amongst poor folks, who aren‚Äôt constantly applying anti-germ wipes/lotions/etc. Whereas any place where folks are well off has those every 10 feet.
@CBSNews Really should have had more on the hygiene hypothesis. Best guess for the rise of peanut allergies is overuse of germ killing wipes/lotion/etc everywhere. Body needs germs to learn what to attack. No germs = body doesn‚Äôt know what‚Äôs bad &amp; attacks good things like peanuts.
@RepLeeZeldin It really is odd how much 2019 is up in arms about racism but cares not a whit about anti-Semitism.
@darrenrovell There‚Äôs no such thing as a boneless wing. They‚Äôre chicken nuggets with sauce.
@gourmetspud Still hard to believe Ray Liotta went from that to stop smoking commercials.
@gourmetspud Karen! That was all we had, Karen!
@ShamsCharania Disaster.
@ShamsCharania @TheAthleticNBA @WatchStadium So the players didn‚Äôt beat the coach? This counts as a victory in the NBA.
@Capitals Who else is picturing his cock?
@wingoz EDGE vs DI, as @PFF taught us
@TheWilderThings @SInow @jessica_smetana No
@chaddukes @DaveBautista That would be brilliant.
@RichardCommey Great fight, brother, and better words after. God bless!
@CandaceDBuckner @PostSports Are we still pretending this season matters?
@jmartNYT @Swerdlick Good for him.
@SeanStipkala @Andrew_Gribble Fine. They went from winning, what, a game per year to .500 under Mayfield? He‚Äôs changed the course of the franchise.
@CandaceDBuckner @PostSports God help you if you‚Äôre still watching this team. You clearly enjoy pain.
@LToucher @mkraju Hot takes like this are why I‚Äôm leaving the Democratic Party. Not that anyone cares.
@USA2043 @Andrew_Gribble I don‚Äôt care. QBs win Super Bowls. Go look at SB history. Lots of middling RBs and great QBs. If we‚Äôre holding a re-draft, Mayfield‚Äôs #1 and it‚Äôs not close.
@CBSNews He didn‚Äôt fall. He jumped.
@CandaceDBuckner @PostSports God bless you for having the fortitude to cover a team going nowhere within the next decade.
@AlbertBreer Your logic is awful. What about an equally good player on a bad team? He should suffer because his team can‚Äôt make the playoffs?
@Lawrence_tko @IChamberlain_ Great fight today!
@ESPNFANSUPPORT Was able to get it added. Tell your management folks I really appreciate the assistance.
@ESPNFANSUPPORT Thanks. Question: does the iPad app block HDMI out? I tried using that as a workaround but it appears the app disallows this.
@MHidalgoUSA @mkraju @Fahrenthold @senatemajldr @GOP Because the GOP supports its people while the Dems can‚Äôt wait to eat their own.
@mkraju The entirety of the government is an abject failure. Virtually no elected representative thinks for him or herself. They just march to the party beat. How about us folks who are sick of both parties? Anyone care about us?
@mkraju Translation: ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs hurting our party so even though we know you can do the job, you have to resign so our party can win in 2020‚Äù. Pathetic. Politics is no longer about getting anything done. It‚Äôs about optics and perpetually positioning your party for the next election.
@ESPNFANSUPPORT Signed up for ESPN+ on the iPad app. Works there. Cannot get it to work on Roku despite following instructions (https://t.co/8kqfKeHycY &amp; entering code). ????
@Andrew_Gribble And by the way, RBs are not important in the modern NFL. Look at the two SB teams. CJ Anderson was picked off the scrap heap. Pats originated RBBC. A QB is inherently far more valuable than a RB.
@Andrew_Gribble By the way - ‚Äúgone beyond any quantifiable measurement‚Äù? How about the franchise was basically 0 for the past 3 years and now they‚Äôre legit playoff contenders? Is that difficult to measure? Going from a laughingstock to legit? That‚Äôs some sort of mystical voodoo?
@Andrew_Gribble It‚Äôs not a difficult choice. Mayfield turned the franchise around. Barkley had a good season.
@StoneLarry It‚Äôs the PAC-12. Tough to figure out whether it‚Äôs worse in basketball or football.
@DSmithShow Have fun with the albatross of a contract he signs.
@21stCenturyFDR @JustinBartonNY @Corb_The_Lesser @VaughnHillyard @maggieNYT Oh my god. Who are you? Han Solo fighting for the Galactic Resistance? Calm down.
@TonyBellew @MatchroomBoxing I don‚Äôt know how Cheese is still on his feet.
@AndrewBrandt PT Barnum was right.
@Giants @saquon What kind of idiot watches an awards show where you already know all the winners?
@Yamiche Maybe we should talk to patients Dr. Northam has treated rather than tilting at windmills from decades ago.
@VaughnHillyard @maggieNYT This makes a lot of sense. Start phasing in a lower eligibility age over time. See how it works. Evaluate and refine.
@espn @ESPNNFL @Lakers Limited, of course, because he‚Äôs never going to play in the NFL again.
@Browns @Kirko58 What is with players bringing moms? Seems bizarre to me. Where are the wives/girlfriends/etc?
@SkySportsBoxing @EddieHearn Super excited AJ is crossing the pond.
@SenKamalaHarris I‚Äôm sure we should take direction from a state that fears rain. Awesome.
@BCAppelbaum Must be nice to think this sort of simplistic thought qualifies as wisdom.
@WillBlackmon I heard Deion ran a 4.27 so... maybe this isn‚Äôt what you‚Äôd call an accurate 40 yd dash.
@CBSNews ‚ÄúUse more lube‚Äù
@OpieRadio It‚Äôs 4:20PM man.
@Bengals @Carlos_Dunlap Is that his mom? WTF is with grown men taking their moms to this? How about a woman you‚Äôre not related to?
@scottwongDC @maggieNYT Try not to leave your footprints on Dr. Northam‚Äôs back as you walk over him to the governor‚Äôs mansion.
@tedlieu @RalphNortham Thanks for hijacking my state, you fuckhead. How about WE decide instead of you? It‚Äôs our state, not yours. Stay out of this unless you‚Äôre a Virginian.
@AJentleson Because the GOP protects its people, unlike @TheDemocrats who throw the body off the boat when the words racism or sexism are said.
@FalconsKelsey @AtlantaFalcons That‚Äôs fucking weird, man. Cut the apron strings already.
@MatchroomBoxing @TheO2 Vicious uppercut from the lad.
@NinaLynnMoreau @KFILE @maggieNYT Because the right doesn‚Äôt eat its own.
@SInow @iamcardib @Kaepernick7 Did she really say ‚Äútake a kneel‚Äù? I can‚Äôt stand her so I refuse to listen.
@MatchroomBoxing @CEdwardsBoxing @boxingbuatsi @LiamConroy92 @Lawrence_tko @wadicamacho @lewis_ritson @team_townend Nice card.
@KrangTNelson When this country dies, snark will be listed as the cause of death on the certificate.
@MatchroomBoxing @Lawrence_tko Any fight that ends with one man on the canvas is alright by me. Will be following Okolie. Like his fight style. Very precise.
@AP As if anyone cares what Virginians think. Who‚Äôs asked them?
@maggieNYT Fairfax couldn‚Äôt be happier to help throw Northam into the briny deep.
@skiheavenly So excited. I‚Äôll be there for a week Feb 6. Timing couldn‚Äôt be better!
@FireyRedmond @RalstonReports Seriously, go look up microfiche from 1985 and see if you can find someone being chastised for blackface. I‚Äôd be shocked if you find anything. No one cared at that time. Was it right? To me, it‚Äôs irrelevant. It was accepted at the time. Ex post facto shaming just seems dumb.
@FireyRedmond @RalstonReports There was no Twitter. No one knew what other people were doing behind closed doors. I guarantee you tons and tons of people did it. Go back to 1985. Reagan was president, Just Say No was in vogue, and CA was still red. Completely different time.
@RalstonReports Keep on applying 2019 values to the past. I‚Äôm sure that‚Äôs gonna turn out great.
@KenTremendous That‚Äôs what drove you to success.
@maggieNYT Maybe, like most men, he didn‚Äôt give a fuck about the yearbook.
@BriaAkii @HShahana Just for fun... why‚Äôs he in there?
@Lovemypirates @HShahana @Koribaby People are tired of excuses. It‚Äôs the school to prison pipeline. It‚Äôs institutional racism. It‚Äôs this. It‚Äôs that. Nothing is anyone‚Äôs fault. There‚Äôs always something or someone else to blame. That‚Äôs why people are frustrated. No one takes responsibility for themselves anymore.
@bigdogup @HShahana @shaunking @NYCMayor @NYCMayorsOffice @amazon @JeffBezos Because Amazon makes money and prisons are a drain on money.
@CSBrondel @redcons2 @HShahana The country might be better off. I doubt the best and brightest are in there.
@HShahana Maybe don‚Äôt go to prison. Wacky idea, I know.
@CBSNews ... some shacks were knocked down.
@_Jackk123 @EddieHearn @DAZN_USA Thanks man. Hope it‚Äôs a good one!
@seanhaskett @brianschatz Well, he‚Äôs black, so he must be magical.
@EddieHearn Never seen him before. Excited to watch this one on @DAZN_USA!
@AtlantaFalcons Worst halftime acts ever. #SuperBowlIn4Words
@MrMichaelLee Don‚Äôt care. Never cared. But I‚Äôm white so no one cares what I think.
@1067theFan Because he‚Äôs asking for more than he‚Äôs worth.
@Friar_Balsam @maggieNYT Why? How does that help the party? It‚Äôs like fighting with one hand tied behind your back. Feeling morally superior is worth nothing.
@zerodbz69 @maggieNYT It has. He has the support of his party, unlike Dr. Northam. @TheDemocrats really love throwing people off the boat as soon as any shred of anything comes out. Just a terrible party.
@Ejmiller25 @maggieNYT How about what Neanderthals were doing there in 30000 BC? Any reports on that you can provide?
@blueridgebean @maggieNYT The media has a giant erection for him.
@maggieNYT ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs on his page‚Äù. This is politics in 2019. Not whether or not a person can do the job. It‚Äôs all fucking nonsense optics and political correctness. Fuck you, @TheDemocrats, for throwing a good man under the bus in the name of winning in 2020. I‚Äôm out.
@brianschatz People like you are why I‚Äôm leaving the Democratic Party. I hate Trump. I might vote for him in 2020. That‚Äôs how much I detest the current Dem party. Keep on eating your own. I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs gonna go real well for you.

@Jon_Chip_Lees90 @ShamsCharania As I see it, AD is far more driven to reach a specific destination than PG. But, the NBA is maybe the worst professional league on earth, so I‚Äôm not the best source.
@cnni Why not just bring a sign that says ‚ÄúFUCK TRUMP‚Äù and be honest about it?
@_LakeZo @ShamsCharania * we‚Äôre really here for
@ShamsCharania What does it matter? AD will just refuse to sign an extension with anyone but the Lakers.
@wojespn Did they also include some trash they collected from behind the Staples Center?
@Bennyficial303 @BEnglish007 Enjoy your lifetime of being an utter dumbass! Have a great life, retard!
@NBA @HoustonRockets Yay NBA! Glad to see you‚Äôre supporting a country that‚Äôs stealing technology from US companies! Yay! Real patriots, this NBA.
@JustinJett_ Fire, like the fire that burns the Chinese government trying to steal technology from US companies.
@APHoustonRocket @Lob2Capela Are you fucking brain damaged? You love a look that supports a country that‚Äôs actively trying to steal tech from our companies? Christ. What the hell is wrong with you?
@Bennyficial303 @BEnglish007 Also - China is an enemy of the US. Fun!
@lbjamesharden Yeah. I love it when players wear a jersey of an enemy of the country. Yay!
@SpaceCity_Scoop Are you aware China is an enemy of the USA?
@Censored1209 @PattyMurray Neither side is completely right, bottom line. This is how the country works: we find middle ground. I‚Äôm no Trump fan, but I cannot stand people saying he‚Äôs not negotiating while Pelosi outright says ‚ÄúI refuse to negotiate‚Äù.
@Bobyt20 @PattyMurray @MarkWarner @BenCardinforMD @SpeakerPelosi It‚Äôs terribly disappointing. I really thought the Dem Senators got it. Then we see they all fall in line behind @SpeakerPelosi.
@DickieV @NCAA @KUHoops Agree 100%.
@ingridostby @KenTremendous @megh_wright Is a drone strike on FuckJerry HQ possible?
@5280_native @jaketapper See, unlike most people, my concern is how well a person can do the job, not irrelevant nonsense from decades ago. Both Northam and Kavanaugh were well positioned to do their jobs. All I can conclude is that the left doesn‚Äôt care about that. It‚Äôs all about nonsense ‚Äúoptics‚Äù.
@5280_native @jaketapper Great judge. Glad he‚Äôs on the SCOTUS.
@jaketapper By the way - constituent‚Äôs trust? They‚Äôve commissioned a poll? Or did they just decide for us? Yep, it‚Äôs the latter.
@jaketapper Well, I‚Äôm no longer a Virginia Democrat. If this is the party of immediate you‚Äôve gotta go, count me out. If Trump wins VA, remember this. Remember you alienated people who resent a good man being thrown aside because you care about your party more than him.
@ShawnCollinsLSP @jaketapper How can you vet yearbooks?
@K9boxing @ShowtimeBoxing @SHOsports And yes, Mr. Ware walks off the winner! Fun night of boxing.
@CBSNews He expected controversy. He got crickets. The Adam Levine Story.
@PattyMurray How about giving the impression you‚Äôll negotiate, then refusing to negotiate? Is that a political game?
@K9boxing @ShowtimeBoxing @SHOsports Think Ware has the better of it from here.
@PattyMurray How about you negotiate in good faith like your colleagues @MarkWarner and @BenCardinforMD promised on the Senate floor? Or does the senior chamber take orders from @SpeakerPelosi ?
@ShowtimeBoxing Mattice doesn‚Äôt seem to have much of a fight plan.
@twolf10 @ewarren Let‚Äôs all kill ourselves. That way, we can make sure we purge all the racists.
@ewarren Keep on eating your own while the GOP doesn‚Äôt care. I‚Äôm sure that‚Äôll turn out well for you.
@jmartNYT @maggieNYT @LevarStoney Let‚Äôs translate: ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs a really good person and doing a great job as Governor but racism so go.‚Äù
@mkraju Because that‚Äôs what it‚Äôs about. Not right and wrong, but defending the party above all else.
@mkraju I wish they could be honest. ‚ÄúGovernor Northam‚Äôs a dead weight against the party‚Äôs hull, so we‚Äôre cutting him loose.‚Äù
@ZekeJMiller No idea, but I‚Äôll tell you who the loser is: us.
@SInow Also, I‚Äôd appreciate a review of the Big Bang. I missed it.
@SInow Nice cold take. Any thoughts on Methuselah? The Lincoln-Douglas debates? Jurassic vs Cretaceous- which was the best?
@FOXSports @PBConFOX @BronzeBomber @MichaelVick Hope Wilder-Fury 2 happens in MSG. Best venue for boxing, bar none.
@HokieNCLT @eliseviebeck Complicated is the right word. Unfortunately, modern people have no time for complicated. All we‚Äôre capable of doing is designating one side right and one side wrong and ne‚Äôer the twain shall meet. I‚Äôm so sad about the state of the country right now.
@AlferdGPacker @HollyTarry @eliseviebeck This is a nonsense take. You‚Äôre saying all the boys in gray who died in the Civil War weren‚Äôt Americans? They were. They spilled blood and died IN THIS COUNTRY. Those kids had no idea what it was about. All they knew was someone gave them a gun and said go shoot the blue guys.
@DoraRoseRose @mkraju Dems love eating their own for some reason.
@mkraju Nothing will bring us together. It‚Äôs over, Johnny.
@GaryLoew @kathrynw5 @maggieNYT @JoePerticone I‚Äôd like to think that.
@NateSilver538 It‚Äôs just ludicrous. If we‚Äôre sending a basketball team to win, do we want the best team or the one with the least background dirt? Governing is no different. We ought to want the best team, not the ones who the opposition can‚Äôt find dirt on. What a fucking embarrassment.
@NateSilver538 I mean, think about this. What‚Äôs going to become of politics? It‚Äôs only open to people who‚Äôve never made a mistake? Is that what we want?  A bunch of people who lived their lives making sure they never did anything that might come back to bite them?
@NateSilver538 How about whether or not he‚Äôs effective at the job? Anyone care about that any more? Or is it all optics and posturing for the next election?
@tedlieu Ted, people like you are why I recently left the Democratic Party.
@dcsportsbog Thank goodness. I was worried about those roving bands of scary people with backpacks running amok in Nats Park last year.
@malitzd @dcsportsbog Technically, it‚Äôs your fault for being dumb enough to go to a Wizards game.
@GovernorVA I voted for you. I support you. Stay the course. Focus on serving Virginians. In a few weeks this firestorm will pass.
@kathrynw5 @maggieNYT @JoePerticone There should be 3 papers in every city: one left, one right, and one that survives on rub &amp; tug ads in the back.
@kathrynw5 @maggieNYT @JoePerticone Also - look at what sells. No one wants real journalism. They want something that tells them whatever they think is OK. You want a paper that supports your side. Blame the dumbass American population who wants to be told what to think, not the papers that do it.
@_jamesewalkerjr @kathrynw5 @JoePerticone Cleaning toilets 40 hours a week, 52 weeks a year is difficult. Journalism isn‚Äôt.
@kathrynw5 @maggieNYT @JoePerticone Seems like smart business. Anyone who‚Äôs on the left reads the WaPo. No point trying to slot in there. Centrists don‚Äôt exist, so what else but to move right?
@jppalmCBS It‚Äôs getting late early, as someone once said.
@mirjordan @maggieNYT How absurd is it that the consequences of investigating undocumented workers, ostensibly to help them, ends up with them all getting fired? Methinks they might have preferred to keep their jobs.
@Nationals Good day. Your new bag policy is asinine. Really appreciate you making it difficult for your customers to attend games in the name of ‚Äúsafety‚Äù when no one feels unsafe there. Awesome stuff, folks.
@dcsportsbog Serious question: do you know ANYONE that has felt unsafe at Nats Park? Is there even one person who thinks that? Because this seems like a solution in search of a problem.
@EvilOmarVizquel @dcsportsbog ‚ÄúGuys, I have a plan. Let‚Äôs target Burke Lake Park‚Äù.
@EvilOmarVizquel @dcsportsbog And really think about how bad of a terrorist you‚Äôd have to be to target Nats Park. You‚Äôve got the White House, the Capitol, etc etc. What kind of incompetent terrorist targets a baseball stadium? He‚Äôd be laughed out of Al Qaeda.
@wa2chi @dcsportsbog What? You want them to be concerned about you, the paying customer? Hah! Hope the turnip truck you came in on made it home safely.
@MikeBDan @dcsportsbog THANK YOU! You, sir, are a genius.
@dcsportsbog What an idiotic decision. The only thing is does is gives fans more incentive to stay home. This man should be fired.
@mjb0007 @PattyMurray Thanks for outing yourself as a dullard! Appreciate it. Have a great life!
@ErinBurnett @tedlieu Goodbye Democratic Party, hello independence. That @TheDemocrats would continue this nonsense is a bridge too far. A man ought to be judged by his work, not a photograph from decades ago.
@KamalaHarris Well, that seals it. I‚Äôm a lifelong Dem. I will not vote for you if you win the primary. I‚Äôll stay home. Thanks!
@jaketapper Well, the list of potential 2020‚Äôers is a mile long. It would be easier to start with who‚Äôs not running.
@RoseLaoutaris @seanhannity PRANK CALLER! PRANK CALLER!
@RoseLaoutaris My president is @seanhannity noooooooooooo
@granthpaulsen Helicopter parents, man.
@WSJ Immaterial. Everyone‚Äôs mind is already made up.
@maggieNYT And as much as I dislike him, as much as Trump is crazy, this proves him right about fake news. Journalism is no longer about reporting. It‚Äôs about telling people what to think. Your profession is a joke. I cannot believe you managed to make his wild assertion true.
@maggieNYT Because there‚Äôs no way this was random. I guarantee you this was the GOP putting dirty tricksters to work mining for dirt on anyone who‚Äôs a Dem. If you stand for this, let‚Äôs just dissolve the country. It would be laughable to call us the United States.
@maggieNYT Let‚Äôs just admit what‚Äôs obvious: the media is sanctioning and incentivizing both parties to seek every single bit of negative information possible. Shame on you. Government should be about getting things done, not bullshit PR and ‚Äúoptics‚Äù. A pox on all of your houses.
@finneyk There‚Äôs no real damage done. The only ‚Äúdamage‚Äù is to the party. That‚Äôs everything wrong with this country. We base everything on optics and nothing on whether the fucking guy can do the job well. Count me on the side of praying the Republic falls. Good lord.
@SInow Either the rule is you must knowingly allow someone to accept $ or it‚Äôs that you don‚Äôt have to allow them, it just has to be received. The NCAA is not only a joke, they have zero ability to craft coherent rules and press releases.
@SInow It‚Äôs incoherent. Allowing something is a volitional act. If someone robs my house, I did not allow them to do. Yet in the next sentence, it‚Äôs said that if my house gets robbed, I allowed it, whether or not I knew about it. Both can‚Äôt be true.
@ed_solomon Some would say the Congress is not real life. From what I‚Äôve seen, that seems accurate.
@slmandel In truth, we‚Äôre all against the NCAA. True story - it recently overtook the Mos Eisley Cantina as the galaxy‚Äôs biggest hive of scum and villainy.
@SenatorCollins Senator, I learned something today. BIW = Bath Iron Works. Thanks!
@anteupannie @peterbakernyt @katierogers @anniekarni Mass murder via wishing. Awesome stuff there hon!
@peterbakernyt @maggieNYT @katierogers @anniekarni What person with money is doing anything other than surrounding themselves with people who like them? Does @BarackObama regularly have @seanhannity over and we‚Äôve not heard about it? The entire premise of this article is ludicrous.
@peterbakernyt @maggieNYT @katierogers @anniekarni And other rich folks are filling their houses with people who hate them? Is that what you‚Äôre suggesting?
@mkraju @MarkWarner @BenCardinforMD @SpeakerPelosi By the way, those are two great Senators whom I respect. It grinds my gears their brand of bipartisanship has been thrown by the wayside in service of @SpeakerPelosi ‚Äòs ‚Äúgive no ground‚Äù policy.
@mkraju How about the promise from Senate Dems to negotiate in good faith on border security? Does a Senator‚Äôs word mean anything any more? I know for a fact @MarkWarner and @BenCardinforMD said on the senate floor they‚Äôd commit to that. I guess @SpeakerPelosi runs the Senate now.
@anradila17 @KellyannePolls @realDonaldTrump Muted. Have a great life.
@anradila17 @KellyannePolls @realDonaldTrump I‚Äôm not sure you‚Äôre aware, but rich people buy things like $238M penthouses, expensive cars, etc. You‚Äôre acting as if it‚Äôs down to the market, get groceries, and go. If you have $30B, I guarantee you‚Äôre going to spend a lot of it. Not all, but a lot.
@deathinkosovo @ewarren ... for a CEO position. I mean, if it takes no skill, just say you‚Äôll do it for a dollar less than the next person and you‚Äôre a shoo-in. Maybe try out for the Lakers too - dream high! We‚Äôre all exactly the same, no difference, everything equal. First CEO to play for the Lakers.
@deathinkosovo @ewarren He‚Äôd hire other people. Most people are replaceable. Sorry to interrupt your riveting solo version of Kumbaya, but that‚Äôs reality. They don‚Äôt need to hire search firms to find the next McDonald‚Äôs employee. Anyone can flip a burger. And hey, if it‚Äôs so easy, maybe you should apply
@mjb0007 @PattyMurray And how about the price of tea in China? Both are equally relevant now, which is to say, worthless.
@TheDemocrats So you‚Äôre reneging on the multiple promises from Democratic Senators to negotiate in good faith on border security?
@SenateDems @SenatorCardin Senator Cardin, I watched on C SPAN when you committed to good-faith negotiations on border security. I hope you live up to that commitment.
@SInow @jjones9 Was there some sort of contest to see who could say the dumbest thing today?
@anradila17 @KellyannePolls @realDonaldTrump In the past, we'd be able to have reasonable, bipartisan discussions as to how to answer that question. No more. Now it's you're on one side or the other, you stop thinking, and you vomit your party's talking points to the other side. It's nonsense.
@anradila17 @KellyannePolls @realDonaldTrump Your premise is sorta right: *some* $ in tax savings does go "out of circulation". It's certainly not all. The question then is really: what's the right balance? That's a complex question, which means few people in today's society of dullards ever asks it.
@anradila17 @KellyannePolls @realDonaldTrump Sure, some of it doesn't help the economy. But I see a lot of rich folks buying property, cars, trips, etc. That money does go into the economy. You need to stop your binary thinking and realize the world is complex, and therefore cannot be summarized with 240 characters.
@anradila17 @KellyannePolls @realDonaldTrump Wow, that's simplistic. You're saying rich people don't buy a lot of expensive things? They're all Scrooge McDuck swimming though hundred dollar bills? That's ludicrous on its face. Stop communicating with nonsense pictures and use your own words.
@anradila17 @KellyannePolls @realDonaldTrump This is like having two great restaurants and asking which is the best. They're both good. Stop your partisan nonsense. Enjoy the solid economy instead of fretting. Have some faith in this country.
@NAACP_LDF We should also give ourselves credit for progress. Amidst all of the partisan nonsense, America has made real progress toward racial equality. That we have further to go shouldn't prevent us from a national pat on the back for making things better.
@anradila17 @KellyannePolls @realDonaldTrump This sort of thing gets immediately labeled as "trickle-down economics", which is unfair. Putting money into the hands of consumers is very often a good thing. Rich people consume a lot, right? That spending goes into the economy &amp; creates jobs. Not perfect, but it helps.
@anradila17 @KellyannePolls @realDonaldTrump And by the way, putting more money in the pockets of taxpayers does have an effect. I got more money in my paycheck, so I took more trips, rented more cars, etc, thus putting more money in the pockets of those workers.
@anradila17 @KellyannePolls @realDonaldTrump Well, today's job numbers were VERY good, but OK, I guess we're skipping over that. Any nonpartisan analysis would say the economy's humming under Mr. Trump. Are there worries? Sure. Tariffs could backfire. But let's be truthful. The economy is very solid.
@TheDemocrats One of my senators, @MarkWarner, stood on the Senate floor and promised good faith negotiations. He's a very good man. I hope the party acts accordingly and negotiates in good faith, as was promised.
@TheDemocrats To be clear: the shutdown's his fault even if Democrats, who promised to negotiate in good faith, do the exact opposite? Because taking wall money from $1.6B to zero is the exact opposite of "good faith negotiation".
@KellyannePolls @realDonaldTrump Presidents always get too much credit for a good economy and too much criticism for a bad economy. Remember that the entire economy sunk in 2008 with the subprime credit crisis. Obama and Trump were basically lucky to come after that. Only way was up.
@rawanduntamed @Wall_E_Scholar @ewarren That's all I ask. Let's use evidence-based studies to figure out what works and make sure the government is spending money wisely rather than throwing money at a problem and hoping it works.
@rawanduntamed @Wall_E_Scholar @ewarren Free college? OK, but you've got to do well and get a good job. Free healthcare? OK, but you've got to have a job. So on and so forth. In my experience a lot of money is thrown around with no requirement that returns on investment be shown.
@rawanduntamed @Wall_E_Scholar @ewarren I'm fine with reinvesting - job training, health care for children, etc. My fear is that Ms. Warren's policies are handouts, not investments. Because an investment means there's a return. I don't want tax dollars thrown around without measurable improvement.
@PattyMurray Senator, can you explain how reducing barrier ("wall") funding from $1.6B to zero represents "working on actual solutions" and the "good faith negotiations" multiple Democratic Senators promised?
@deathinkosovo @ewarren Doesn't have anything to do with their value as a human being. Most working folk are great people. This is not about that. This is about the value of their labor. It's a supply and demand issue. If you don't have skills/knowledge, sorry - you're getting $12 an hour.
@deathinkosovo @ewarren It's why LeBron James is super wealthy. Not many people who can play basketball like he can. That's his fault? Of course not. Why, then, is the rest of the world different? Some people are worth more than others. Sorry.
@deathinkosovo @ewarren That CEO's work is 200 times more valuable, yes. There are hundreds of millions of people who can push a broom or flip a burger. The number of people who can direct a large corporation is many orders of magnitude smaller. Scarcity drives pay.
@DesmondHoward @CocaCola @ccfreestyle Desmond, if there's anything you can do to get more Freestyle machines built and distributed, the whole country would appreciate it. Those things should be everywhere.
@courtneyknorris @SenJeffMerkley @FBI @SecNielsen Can anyone identify precisely when weaponizing guests to the SOTU started? Because it's in full bloom now.
@JerryMoran Maybe you could do something more useful like watch paint dry or grass grow.
@Wall_E_Scholar @ewarren What is "their fair share"? Because in theory, taxes are paying for services the government provides. The ultra-wealthy don't get better services. They get the same services and pay orders of magnitude more.
@deathinkosovo @ewarren No - they haven't earned more.
@ewarren Fair share? What are they getting for their money? Reserved parking spaces? Priority garbage pickup? Oh, right. They're not getting more. You're just taking more of their $$ because "they don't need it". Awesome.
@chaddukes Boy, was it awkward when @erockradio did that as a @BigOandDukes live read and didn't know what movie it was from.
@anitakumar01 Was there a prompt for a laugh track?
Hey @Walmart - great to be lied to by your customer service who told me it's not your fault I'm not getting my TV on time, blamed @FedEx, who said we don't even have the TV yet. It's YOUR FAULT. Never again. @Amazon forever. @FedEx support was amazing. Yours is hellish.
@GaryDoner @LindseyGrahamSC @realDonaldTrump @SpeakerPelosi Many said the same about Mr. Obama and the ACA - throwing money at a bad idea. That's a president's prerogative. Clearly you hate Trump and nothing I say will change that, so have a great life.
@SenFeinstein The current process simply isn't fair in any reasonable sense of the word. Men are presumed guilty until proven innocent. You can both be against sexual assault and for a fair process. They're not mutually exclusive.
@SenDuckworth This. Addiction is a medical problem, not a moral or criminal problem. It requires a medical answer. Once we accept that, we can start to make some progress with treatment as opposed to prison.
@theoneshannon @LindseyGrahamSC @realDonaldTrump You're saying *lowering* barrier $ from your previous offer is good faith negotiating? It's not. It's like me saying I'll pay $100 for your TV, you come back with $200, and I say $50. It's incoherent. It's not negotiating. It's a giant middle finger from @SpeakerPelosi to POTUS.
@LindseyGrahamSC @realDonaldTrump Agree 100%. This is a big middle finger from @SpeakerPelosi to POTUS. Zero negotiation, zero bipartisanship, just my way or the highway.
@thedailybeast Asylum is for people who are forced to leave their country due to political persecution - think Jews in WW2. Leaving because of DV is not political persecution. DV is bad. It's not what asylum was created for.
@ToomeyMemes @SenBobCasey Here's how you do it: win the White House in 2020.
@SenBobCasey Because asylum is for people persecuted by the state for their race, religion, etc. Domestic violence may be bad. In no world is it equivalent to all Jews being expelled by a country.
The ol' bait and switch. These are taken from the web just now. Doesn't say "we hope it arrives by 2/2". It says "arrives by". Boooooooo @Walmart https://t.co/handnQEZ3q
@Walmart Not happy with your "2 day shipping". Ordered a TV for my dad, was told on website/in email it would arrive Sat in time for the Super Bowl, tracking says Monday. Don't say 2 day shipping if you can't do it. Back to @amazon for me....
@SenSherrodBrown @SenatorBennet Also, we're not "giving money to corporations". We're taking less of their money. Please state it correctly. *This* plan is giving out money. Taking less money from a corporation != giving them money.
@JusticeToAll @rjresist @SenSherrodBrown @SenatorBennet Then don't have children. It's that simple.
@SenSherrodBrown @SenatorBennet Here's a wild idea: if you aren't financially well off, don't have kids.

@jimsciutto Senate Dems did e.g. @MarkWarner.
@nflnetwork @89JonesNTAF @AaronDonald97 would like a word.
@LisaDNews I just hope they can use the time wisely and reach a deal before Feb 15. There cannot be a second shutdown.

@BigOandDukes Look at this magic https://t.co/AVCnHJSePY
Or a Lethal Weapon 3 machine! https://t.co/AVCnHJSePY This fits the BOAD brand.
@BigOandDukes What if instead of a custom-built pinball machine you got an existing one and had someone like @Craneium do custom art and such to make it a BOAD machine? I bet you could find one that could be adapted to work.
@senrobportman This has to be the last one.
@RlorD_2012 @Acosta @Jordanfabian Agreed. That's why everyone's saying the shutdown will be over soon. Once POTUS declares nat'l emergency, CR should pass through easily.
@LisaDNews Oh lord please make this be true.
@xplorewy @LisaDNews Agreed. Before this shutdown, I didn't give PBS any consideration in terms of reporting. Now? It seems to be the closest to a non-partisan source as exists in media today. Appreciate you.

@netflix I recently pondered canceling. Now with the Bundy doc, no way. Please keep more docs and such coming. This is fantastic.
@ThatEricAlper Archaeologist with a Mazda RX-7 with monster truck tires.
@SenAngusKing I don‚Äôt think it gets done without that. I don‚Äôt think POTUS trusts Dems enough to allow a CR with zero wall funding, and TBH, I don‚Äôt blame him given the rhetoric coming from that side.
@SenAngusKing All it takes is adding $140M as a ‚Äúprorated down payment‚Äù for the wall. Small sum to get to a yes.
@markschlereth Try the veal
@Swerdlick You just made a great point on CNN re: seeing and raising. I too am puzzled as to why @SpeakerPelosi wouldn‚Äôt come back with a huge ask. I guess the only conclusion is that she thinks waiting means a better deal?
@LisaDNews Split the difference and call it $140M. Done.
@LindseyThiry You gotta step up to the American Crew light hold gel. That‚Äôs what a baller like SM prob uses.
@RepSwalwell The Capital isn‚Äôt 2,000 miles long. Not what you‚Äôd call an apples to apples comparison.
@JefferyScottSm1 @timphamdotcom @BenjaminSWatson @camjordan94 @nflcommish The owners. Goodell‚Äòs power comes from them. So, blame the 31 other owners if it makes you feel better.
@JohnVicars1 @newhouse_jr @BenjaminSWatson @nflcommish God forbid you do something like, I don‚Äôt know, convert in the red zone in Q1 or block Dante Fowler. No, it makes much more sense to blame Goodell. That‚Äôs the ticket.
@JohnVicars1 @newhouse_jr @BenjaminSWatson @nflcommish I think what they want is some sort of stuffed Goodell doll where you pull the string and it says ‚Äúsorry we missed that call‚Äù. Perhaps that will reassure these crying babies.
@timphamdotcom @JefferyScottSm1 @BenjaminSWatson @camjordan94 @nflcommish Your quarrel is with the inability of that play to be reviewed. Don‚Äôt yell at the league. Yell at the competition committee, who by the way ALREADY SAID THEY‚ÄôRE LOOKING AT IT.
@timphamdotcom @JefferyScottSm1 @BenjaminSWatson @camjordan94 @nflcommish You‚Äôre just not a smart person. You got it right with the first part. Missed calls happen. They don‚Äôt self-segregate into only non-critical parts of the game. Because they happen to occur in a critical part of the game doesn‚Äôt promote them to some sort of unforgivable sin.
@Coach5209 @JohnnyChildres @BenjaminSWatson @nflcommish If he made a statement, it would be: ‚ÄúHey, assholes, missed calls are a part of the game. Stop whining‚Äù. Is that what you want?
@CalvinHairstyle @BenjaminSWatson @nflcommish &lt;looks through rule book&gt; I can‚Äôt find anything about resuming a game due to Twitter mockery. What section of the rule book is that in?
@CalvinHairstyle @BenjaminSWatson @nflcommish What you‚Äôre describing is a missed call. They happen literally hundreds if not thousands of times every season. Get over it. This is in no way unique other than your team‚Äôs inability to accept that.
@AlexPierson0 @muffindan @vjdancer93 @_JBush_ @BenjaminSWatson @nflcommish You idiot, the league‚Äôs already said they‚Äôre looking at that. What more do you want? Roger Goodell to come to Bourbon Street so the locals can throw rotten tomatoes at him?
@butchknight @BenjaminSWatson @nflcommish Well said? Are you high? He acknowledges missed calls are a part of the game but for some mystical reason this is some sort of Rubicon meriting diving intervention. It‚Äôs nothing more than sour grapes. What an embarrassing way to go out.
@AdamSchefter What a ludicrous statement. Let me simplify it: ‚ÄúBad calls happen, but somehow this one is different for no apparent reason other than it was my team and my last game, therefore you should do something for me‚Äù.
@mkraju Senate should just pass 3 week CR, negotiate border security, and let the chips fall where they may. If Pelosi/POTUS not on board, oh well, at least they tried.
@mkraju Well, that ray of hope died quickly. Back to utter depression.
@mkraju @KilloughCNN Kinda weird for someone in the house to dictate to the Senate. Not exactly the way the founders drew it up.
@mkraju It means they commit to x amount of money now and y amount in the future.
@SenatorCollins Thanks, Senator. I hope the 3 week CR with good-faith negotiations works. Good luck!
@SenBlumenthal PLEASE get on board with the 3 week CR &amp; good-faith negotiations on border security, to include a substantial amount for physical barriers where needed. Thanks!
@mkraju Christ, I hope the moderate voices win out. If this doesn't work, we may very well be talking about months and not weeks in terms of an endgame. Give POTUS enough to feel like he won, negotiate, and get this done.
@Sasquatchanon @Honda753 @brianschatz No problem. I live to serve.
@pablo_honey1 @TexasJeffUSA @PressSec The outcome will be Trump saying he fulfilled his campaign promise, Dems saying they didn't cave, and both sides avoid losing face while being able to claim victory. Which is how most negotiations end.
@pablo_honey1 @TexasJeffUSA @PressSec So long as that bipartisan group can reassure POTUS he will get enough wall funding to make him happy, it'll work. The blocker was the perception of no wall espoused by Speaker Pelosi. This moves them to a "some wall" position from "no wall".
@pablo_honey1 @TexasJeffUSA @PressSec Right - and the new agreement amongst a group of Senators is to commit to good-faith negotiations on border security. Translation: give enough barrier funding so POTUS can claim a fulfilled campaign promise.
@TexasJeffUSA @pablo_honey1 @PressSec I *think* they'll all go along. It's enough of a win for both sides to claim victory without being so lopsided as to leave one side a clear loser. In the end, all that matters is saving face and not giving the other side ammo for 2020. I think this does both.
@TexasJeffUSA @pablo_honey1 @PressSec I think the only thing that can blow it up now is either POTUS or Schumer/Pelosi torpedoing the idea. Praying they don't. This is by far the closest we've come to a real end to the shutdown.
@TexasJeffUSA @pablo_honey1 @PressSec No, they're now committed to negotiating - at least a bunch of Senators are. Both POTUS and Pelosi/Schumer need to follow their lead. 3 week CR with legit negotiations - i.e. some amount of barrier funding along with other stuff. It's the right answer.
@bwpeery @senrobportman What it took was a commitment from Dems to negotiate in good faith, i.e. to reach a genuine compromise. It's a little bit of a rebuke to Ms. Pelosi insofar as she wanted no commitments to meet the other side in the middle.
@pablo_honey1 @PressSec What? You want more shutdown? Speak for yourself. I'm proud of the Senators that are shutting out the partisan nonsense and working on a solution that will give everyone enough to call it a win and get out of this situation.
@HouseDemocrats @SenateGOP I could easily answer this for you, but it feels awkward for a regular ol' citizen to explain things to you.
@ABC I do like me some Joe Biden.
@pablo_honey1 @PressSec It's gonna be a 3 week CR with some amount of funding for a physical barrier. Please support it. It's the only way out of this mess.
@PressSec Fingers crossed.
@LindseyGrahamSC Sad it took this long to get there but happy we're finally there. This is the answer. No one will get everything they want but workers will be paid and we'll have a secure border.
@MarkWarner THAT'S MY SENATOR! https://t.co/IEijsrhfBB
@BreakingNLive Yikes.
@RepKatieHill @cspan Please support the 3 week CR based on good-faith negotiations re: border security now being discussed on the Senate floor. Whatever you can do to get the House on board would be awesome. You can do it!
@ChrisVanHollen This is the right solution. Thank you Senator. I'm glad sanity finally appears to have prevailed.
@senrobportman It's unfortunate it took this long to get there, but there we are, and the end is in sight. I congratulate rank and file Senators for finally embracing a common-sense solution. Well done.
@senrobportman This is the right solution. Thanks Senator and your colleagues. We'll get some physical barrier - not as much as the POTUS wants, but enough - as well as other security mechanisms and best of all, workers paid NOW.
@timkaine The 3 week CR contingent on good-faith negotiations is the answer. I know you'll work with your colleagues across the aisle to craft a solution that gives everyone something but no one everything.
@Honda753 @Sasquatchanon @brianschatz Happy to report there is a solution in sight. Senators on the floor right now are proposing a 3 week CR in exchange for good-faith negotiations on border security. That's the solution.
@lisamurkowski Senator, I finally see the end in sight. A 3 week CR with a commitment to good-faith negotiations on both sides is perfect. THANK YOU!
@MarkWarner So glad to hear what you're saying now on the floor. I finally see the end in sight. Proud to be a Virginian. Thanks!
@PattyMurray Here's the way out: rank and file Dems need to tell leadership that it has to make a real, genuine, good-faith statement that it will reach a mutually acceptable compromise in those 2 weeks. That's what will get it done.
@PattyMurray If Pelosi/Schumer agree to real negotiations, including a substantial sum for wall funding, then I'd be on board. But this vague "conversation about border security" won't get it done.
@PattyMurray I'd support you if I thought there was any chance of real negotiation. I don't see it. I think it's a lock we're back to shutdown in 2 weeks. Your party leadership will have to move off its no wall position to avoid that.
@ABC Sounds about right.
@jordantl @NateSilver538 @GOP Tell me what a 2 week CR would accomplish to solve the real problem, which is border security. IMHO, nothing. We shut down again in 2 weeks. I'm not sure giving them back pay and then stopping checks 2 weeks later is any sort of real solution. It might be worse.
@LastGreatAct @NateSilver538 What, you think there's some sort of inquisition round where they have to justify their votes?
@SenWhitehouse @realDonaldTrump @senatemajldr He brought your bill to the floor. It failed. What is it, exactly, you want him to do?
@DataDeviant @goldenheart1995 @RepKatieHill Which changes nothing. Sorry.
@DataDeviant @goldenheart1995 @RepKatieHill 52-44, motion fails, shutdown continues.
@DataDeviant @goldenheart1995 @RepKatieHill It won't pass since there are 41 nays.
@DataDeviant @goldenheart1995 @RepKatieHill As I hear the roll call, it's prob about the same - +/- 50/50, about 10 votes short of what's needed.
@DataDeviant @goldenheart1995 @RepKatieHill We need not argue. The Senate is literally voting on it right now. No need to debate hypotheticals. We're about to hear how far from 100-0 we ended up.
@BarbaraVanlaan @SenHydeSmith Then pray tell, what's the point of the House bill, which re-opens government for 2 weeks? Magically an insoluble problem will be solved 2 weeks from now? Of course not.
@DataDeviant @goldenheart1995 @RepKatieHill In the hypothetical, I mean the breakup occurred in the year between now and then. Like, just because things were a certain way &lt;x&gt; days ago doesn't mean you get to assume they should be now.
@DataDeviant @goldenheart1995 @RepKatieHill No, they don't. They *did* have 100-0. They no longer have it. It's like me saying "hey, I f**ked my ex a year ago, I'm gonna hit her up tonight". It doesn't work that way. Things change. When they do, it becomes history and pointless to the now.
@AP Good news, you can basically just change a few words on this one and you'll be good to go.
@AP Hope you have that "Senate Republicans block House-backed measure" tweet ready to go.
@CMillhollon Oh, for Christ's sake. I have a mandatory mute policy for anyone who uses that hack term. Have a great life.
@4argumntsake @SenTedCruz @SenDanSullivan @USCG I'd like to agree. I just think it would be even more cruel to re-open, give them pay, and then go back into a shutdown 2 weeks later. I maintain the better route is to solve it now so we don't do that. But, that bill just failed, so the house bill is the only one left.
@goldenheart1995 @DataDeviant @RepKatieHill This is true. Right wing TV talk accused POTUS of caving on his campaign promise, he did a 180. That being said, he's allowed to do that. You can dislike it, but he's the most powerful person in the country. When his mind changes, so does everything.
@granthpaulsen This... seems good?
@ourqueenrachel @clairecmc Bye! I'm not sure what that means. I'm going to assume you mean an intelligent, level-headed, incredibly insightful human being, so - THANKS! :)
@PrettyBoyClass1 @LKatGold @SenSchumer @realDonaldTrump Thanks for the update. I was really wondering about that, having followed you for many years.
@ourqueenrachel @clairecmc And by the way, Ms, McCaskill - I was a big Merrick Garland fan. üíî
@ourqueenrachel @clairecmc You can dislike him. Many people do, as you know. But please don't peddle this claptrap. He cannot shut down the government willy-nilly and if you believe that lie, you're a rube who deserves the terrible government you'll get as a result.
@ourqueenrachel @clairecmc Pelosi's selling you a work of fiction. The notion that "he'll just do it whenever" is simply not true. It's a story made up so people like you will think he has magical powers and support her against him.
@ourqueenrachel @clairecmc But he can't. Appropriations bills come up about once a year. He has two years left in his term. You do the math. There just aren't many opportunities to do it this term. He can't just "shut down the government" whenever he wants. It's not possible.
@clairecmc Also, you did a good job in Congress. I didn't mean that to sound like I dislike you. :)
@clairecmc Two wrongs don't make a right. As MLK Jr said: It's always the right time to do the right thing. As it's said: an eye for an eye and the whole world goes blind. Your job is running the country, not settling scores. This isn't the Wild West.
@LisaDNews Compromise will be required. There's just no good reason to wait 2-3 weeks to start on it. The time is now.
@LisaDNews Here's what will happen: the same tired talking points will be repeated and we'll be in the exact same situation in 2-3 weeks. Only in Congress can you call that a solution.
@LisaDNews The 2-3 week re-opening is a terrible idea. Nothing will change. Has anyone seen one shred of evidence that suggests 2-3 weeks will somehow magically result in compromise? Nope. It's just a feel-good measure that obfuscates the real issues.
@4argumntsake @SenTedCruz @SenDanSullivan @USCG Then pass the Shelby amendment, which funds government through 9/30. The House bill funds gov't for *2 weeks* and prays somehow we'll work the rest out in that time. What do you think's going to change in 2 weeks? Nothing.
@RepKatieHill It won't get 60 votes. Thanks for keeping the shutdown going. Awesome stuff.
@RepKatieHill * re-open the government for 2 weeks at which point it will shut down again because there's zero sign your party has any interest in negotiating border security
@SenatorTomUdall It won't happen. Listening to C-SPAN. Dems have no interest in compromise. This fiction of 2 weeks to negotiate is nonsense. They can negotiate now. The 2 weeks will do nothing to change anything.
@SenSanders Attention Senator: There's a bill on the floor that will re-open government until 9/30. I suggest you vote for it if it's more important to do that than "send a message to the POTUS" and keep government shut down. Your call.
@LKatGold @RodJone62401427 @SenSchumer @realDonaldTrump This continuous flagellation of the POTUS does *nothing* but choke government to a halt. Get past yourself &amp; your emotions. Get past your enmity for him. Do the job. Hint: the job is getting things done, not complaining and name-calling.
@LKatGold @RodJone62401427 @SenSchumer @realDonaldTrump Oh my God. Enough with the drama. Government must be bipartisan to work. The Legislative branch must work with the Executive branch. I don't care if you hate the POTUS. He's there. Want the country to work? Deal with it. Deal with him.
@BarbaraVanlaan @SenHydeSmith Or, you can support the House bill that will open us up again for 2 weeks only to end in another shutdown. Why? Why wait? Why not solve it now? It's foolish to think two weeks will change anything. If we can make a deal in 2 weeks, we can make it now.
@BarbaraVanlaan @SenHydeSmith Another week? Why, that changes everything! If another week's good, how about until the end of September? Sound good? Then support the Shelby bill. That funds gov't through Sep 30.
@SenatorDurbin What on earth will change between now and Feb 8? Nothing. This is the moment. Kicking the can two weeks down the road would be irresponsible. Negotiate hard, but get it done now.
@SenatorDurbin Well, thanks for voting to keep the shutdown going, Senator. I'm sure your constituents will find your anti-immigrant stand cold comfort when they're not getting paid. By the way, your bill would only give us two weeks to work. Why not just solve things now? Why delay?
@BartYoungblood @BarbaraVanlaan @SenHydeSmith So would the Shelby bill - and, bonus, it funds the government through the end of September instead of Feb 8! Sounds like a good deal to me. What say you, sir?
@CMillhollon @SenTedCruz @SenDanSullivan @USCG Nothing's going to change in the next two weeks that will change the calculus of the moment. We strike a deal now and fund the government through the end of September. Negotiate hard, but it has to get done.
@CMillhollon @SenTedCruz @SenDanSullivan @USCG And then it will shut down again on Feb 8. That's what you need to understand about the House bill. It ends the shutdown for less than two weeks, at which point we'll be right here again. That would be irresponsible. The time to act is now.
@SenTedCruz @SenDanSullivan @USCG I thought this was a powerful point. Hard to say being against paying the Coast Guard is a defensible position. Yet, here we are.
@tedcruz Not necessarily a fan of yours, but you're making a lot of sense on the floor right now. I hope you and your colleagues can get it done today. I don't care how, just get the government open. Good luck. Also, moats &amp; catapults - I LOL'd.
@SenatorBennet Wow. A lot of fire on the floor. I don't know that I agree with every word but I love your passion. I hope you and your colleagues can get the job done today. Also, thanks for educating me on the Hastert Rule. Yes, it's got to go.
@LKatGold @kath2357 @SurrealChaos @SenSchumer @realDonaldTrump Absolutely nothing will happen between now and Feb 8. The time to come to an agreement is now. There's no reason to kick the can down the road a week. Congress can and must do its job now.
@LKatGold @kath2357 @SurrealChaos @SenSchumer @realDonaldTrump Well, then let's move the Shelby bill forward in the Senate. Because the House bill would only fund gov't for another week+. What's more irresponsible than a shutdown? Solving it with another shutdown.
@RoyBlunt Thought you spoke very well on the floor today. I hope it leads to a breakthrough. Not optimistic, butü§û&amp; good luck. I hope Congress can do its job today.
@NateSilver538 Genius.
@LKatGold @kath2357 @SurrealChaos @SenSchumer @realDonaldTrump First, we're talking about the POTUS, not a hostage taker. Second, when? There's exactly ONE time this could happen again - a year from today. That's it. This notion POTUS can shut down government any time is nonsense.
@timkaine As a constituent, I disagree with your statement on the floor that passing a bill that would shut the gov't down again on Feb 8 is reasonable. There's nothing that will change between now &amp; then. The time to fix things is now, not kick the can down the road a week.
@marlenebeck16 @LKatGold @SenSchumer @realDonaldTrump Good to know. We'll call off the elections, then, Thanks!
@BuildTheDWall1 @SenHydeSmith People really need to look at the Shelby bill. Yes, it has wall funding. That's a small part. There's a ton of other stuff in there, and a lot to like no matter what side of the aisle you're on. Educate yourself.
@BecauseIDied @SenHydeSmith Clean bill would shut down gov't again on Feb 8. It's not a solution. Fix it now. Another week will not change the calculus. It would be irresponsible to end the shutdown only to create another one in a week.
@BarbaraVanlaan @SenHydeSmith The "Clean CR" would shut government down again on Feb 8 unless both sides can agree on border security. Why re-open for a week? Why not deal with it now? Solve the problem. Don't punt it a week down the road.
@SenCapito Watching you now on C Span. I appreciate you reminding folks that 654 miles of barrier already exist. Like you, I hear a lot of people saying this is some new idea when it isn't. Good luck today. ü§û
@SannaPropp @LKatGold @SenSchumer @realDonaldTrump Snail (sex) lives matter.
@AP If you care about accurate reporting, maybe give the context. "... instead of taking out loans to pay bills" is a crucial part of the story. In case you care about accurate coverage rather than partisan clicks.
@RepSwalwell Maybe also be embarrassed you're an elected representative communicating with emojis like a teenager. Just a thought.
@LKatGold @Idowudyno @SenSchumer @realDonaldTrump For @SpeakerPelosi to label a wall immoral is just clueless. It's not a proxy for fighting about immigration. It's just a people funnel. It has no morality, just like a rake, or a hammer, or any other tool. It just serves a purpose. If we take emotion out of it, it's easy.
@LKatGold @Idowudyno @SenSchumer @realDonaldTrump You fly into JFK, or LAX, or SFO, and so on because that's where all of the resources for dealing with folks from outside the country are located. It wouldn't make sense for them to fly into a tiny airport in the middle of nowhere. We funnel people to sites. A wall does that too.
@LKatGold @Idowudyno @SenSchumer @realDonaldTrump I mean, is anyone saying that it's racist and immoral we only let non-citizens fly into a select few airports? Of course not. It's so we can put all of the CBP folks there so we align resources where they're needed. So too with a wall. Just puts gov't and people in the same place
@LKatGold @Idowudyno @SenSchumer @realDonaldTrump In theory, that should be a win-win. We have orderly migration, migrants go immediately to places that are prepared for them, everything runs smoothly. Sadly, in this hyperpartisan era, no one can see the wall for what it is: just a management tool. It's just another widget.
@LKatGold @Idowudyno @SenSchumer @realDonaldTrump I think that's being lost in the debate. A wall isn't really to keep people out. It's more to channel them to specific spots where we're prepared to deal with them. Without that, it gets chaotic quickly.
@LKatGold @Idowudyno @SenSchumer @realDonaldTrump A physical barrier helps that. We want to channel folks to locations where we have immigration facilities, judges, and so on. Does it make us "safer"? Perhaps not, but it is a valuable part of managing the southern border.
@LKatGold @Idowudyno @SenSchumer @realDonaldTrump I think the majority of Americans are dullards, sadly. I don't think most Americans are aware we already have 645 miles of physical barrier on the border. Given the migration crisis, I think it's prudent to make sure everyone goes through designated places of entry.
@HBO @RobLowe @ralphmacchio I draw the line at the Canadian tuxedo.
@ABC I'm sure class warfare is going to help the situation. Maybe consider tamping the flames down rather than throwing gasoline on them, Senator.
@LKatGold @SenSchumer @realDonaldTrump And by the way, I'd vote for your former governor in a heartbeat. I love him. I wish he'd run and get the nomination. We could use a pragmatist in the White House to unite us. I thought he did a fine job in CO.
@LKatGold @SenSchumer @realDonaldTrump Apropos of nothing, Colorado is beautiful. I'm heading out to Telluride Saturday for some skiing. It's a fine state. Probably my #1 seed if I had to pick another state.
@Idowudyno @LKatGold @SenSchumer @realDonaldTrump It's true, but keep in mind polling is really dependent on how questions are asked. If they say "are you in favor of a wall" you get one result. If they say "are you in favor of a physical barrier in certain portions of the border" you get another. Polls != truth.
@LKatGold @SenSchumer @realDonaldTrump If SC goes blue, states like WI/MI will already have gone blue and those are enough for a win. Interesting in the big picture, but immaterial to the results of that specific election. Anyway, sorry for the civics lecture. I'll see myself out.
@LKatGold @SenSchumer @realDonaldTrump My only point is that if votes in red states matter, then they don't matter, because the swing states will already have been enough to put the Dem candidate in the White House. If we're looking at SC to see if it flipped, the rest of the map is already a win for blue.
@LKatGold @SenSchumer @realDonaldTrump I'm in Virginia. Same thing. Formerly red, now blue. You're right - over time, things change. At a four-year level, not so much. I'm oversimplifying, of course, to make a point. California is blue for the foreseeable future. There, votes don't matter. Same with DC.
@LKatGold @SenSchumer @realDonaldTrump If you're in MN, WI, MI, IN, OH, PA, NC your vote matters. Otherwise, it probably doesn't. The rest of the states are fairly predictable. You can go vote if it makes you feel better, but it's unlikely to change anything.
@LKatGold @SenSchumer @realDonaldTrump Good luck. Just keep in mind the votes of the vast majority of Americans don't matter. There are known blue states and known red states. 100% of California could vote against Trump and it wouldn't change the calculus. The only votes that matter are swing states.
@LKatGold @CheveyoFlores @SenSchumer @realDonaldTrump It's not a zero sum game. We can have all of those items. Sure, at some point there are fiscal constraints, but keep in mind non-military discretionary spending is a small part of the budget. About 75% is entitlements, the military, and interest on the national debt.
@katelovescolor @ABC @SpeakerPelosi There just isn't any reason we should be hearing about government constantly. It should be like the electric company. It just works and you don't hear about it. Every once in a while? Fine. Otherwise, stop bothering us and do your jobs quietly and efficiently.
@katelovescolor @ABC @SpeakerPelosi As the two parties become more extreme, independents will become the swing votes. I just hope one day we have some sort of sanity party where we get rid of the extremists on both sides, cut the rhetoric, and quietly manage the country in an efficient way.
@katelovescolor @ABC @SpeakerPelosi And this notion of "well, the GOP's terrible, so you have to be a Dem" is hogwash. I'm neither. I'll now vote for each candidate on her own merits. Neither party cares about people like me. I'll not care about them. I think you're going to see more and more of this.
@katelovescolor @ABC @SpeakerPelosi Hey, if you love this new Democratic party, god bless. I don't like the GOP either. My point is that sane centrists don't have a party. It's either the extreme right or the extreme left. There is no party to represent those of us who just want everyone to get along.
@CheveyoFlores @LKatGold @SenSchumer @realDonaldTrump In all seriousness, the government wastes money all the time. At worst, this $5.6B for the wall is just another way to do it. The government loses billions like you and I lose quarters in our couch cushions. It just isn't a significant number in the big picture.
@LKatGold @kath2357 @SenSchumer @realDonaldTrump Like the fact neither bill to be voted on today in the Senate will get 60 votes, and therefore the fact is that either the sides hammer out a compromise or the shutdown goes on? Do those facts matter? Thanks!
@LKatGold @SenSchumer @realDonaldTrump You'll need 13 GOP Senators to vote for the House bill. It's not happening. Feel free to keep your fingers crossed, but I'm telling you, EVERYONE - like, MSNBC too - knows the House bill won't pass. You'd have better luck repealing the law of gravity.
@LKatGold @SenSchumer @realDonaldTrump Alrighty then. The vast majority of Americans can vote on the Senate floor to move the Dem bill forward. Wait... sorry, I got that wrong. Senators get to vote, not the American people. My bad.
@almasmrttgrl @SenSchumer @realDonaldTrump @MargotRobbie Thanks! Fingers crossed. Appreciate you.
@cnni https://t.co/caFDMAv5Dp
@kath2357 @LKatGold @SenSchumer @realDonaldTrump Katherine, maybe you heard. The world is now a zero-sum game where one side is right and the other is wrong. Awesome stuff!
@LKatGold @SenSchumer @realDonaldTrump They won't. Everyone on both sides knows neither bill will get 60 votes. Stop hoping for something that won't happen and encourage your representatives to work on a compromise to end the shutdown. That's the only path forward.
@AlMartine000 @SenSchumer @realDonaldTrump It won't. Neither bill will get 60 votes. It's widely known amongst everyone on both sides of the aisle.
@SenSchumer @realDonaldTrump Also, you just have to love the term "clean bill". Wonderful code for "bill I like". Bills I don't like? Dirty, filthy, ragamuffin bills.
@almasmrttgrl @SenSchumer @realDonaldTrump This. It will not get 60 votes. I'll get married to @MargotRobbie before that bill goes anywhere, and let me tell you, based on her lack of response, that could be a while.
@SenSchumer @realDonaldTrump Senator, not sure you heard, there's not one but two bills. Yay! Naturally you'll vote yes on both and work out a deal, right? And not let this shutdown drag on because you refuse to move from your "no wall" position? Because that would be unfortunate.
@HouseDemocrats Hey, y'all, stepping in to help. We found him! He's on the Senate floor with two bills to reopen gov't! Hallelujah! Now you can get moving and vote yes on both! XOXO, me.
@ABC I am so embarrassed for my country. This is what the Democratic party has turned into? The party of snark and sick burns? Christ. This is why I'm no longer a Dem. GET SHIT DONE. STOP TALKING. You're not Princess Leia @SpeakerPelosi. We're in the US, not the Galactic Empire.
@icewolf1911 @SenThomTillis You're wrong, sorry. You don't get to set the topic. The POTUS won't sign a bill without some wall funding. When you get elected to the White House, then you can make those decisions. Until then, your opinion is irrelevant. Have a great life, you partisan rube.
@IvanKaramazovD @SenThomTillis With that attitude, there will be no compromise and the shutdown will continue ad infinitum. Nice job! You ought to run for Congress. With that all-rhetoric, no-action platform, you'll fit right in. By the way, I used to be a Dem until the party was invaded by you dullards. #HAGL
@guitardberry @SenThomTillis @SpeakerPelosi @SenSchumer Good luck &amp; have a great life.
@guitardberry @SenThomTillis By the way, I was a lifelong Democrat until this year, when the party decided @SpeakerPelosi is Princess Leia, @SenSchumer is Han Solo, and we're all in some bizarre galactic resistance rather than living in the United States I knew.
@guitardberry @SenThomTillis But, if I know your ilk, you'll just continue repeating the same tired talking points, act surprised when your bill doesn't get 60 votes even though every sane person on earth knows it won't, return to blaming Trump, bemoan more shutdown, and keep lying about border compromise.
@guitardberry @SenThomTillis 1) He said he would 2) It's widely known both bills are not going to get 60 votes 3) Then be honest and say "we want everything we want without giving anything". Don't hide behind the sham pretense of compromise. Just say you get nothing you lose everything good day sir.
@icewolf1911 @SenThomTillis Fortunately, there are two bills on the floor of the Senate today to end the shutdown. It should be fairly easy to iron out a compromise. If you care about ending the shutdown, that is.
@JoAnnCoach7 @SenThomTillis It's in writing. In a bill that will be voted on today on the Senate floor.
@Pia_NMFTG @SenThomTillis Thanks for contributing nothing. Any quotes from Methuselah you'd like to bring forward?
@guitardberry @SenThomTillis POTUS will veto the House bill and there aren't the votes to override his veto. By the way, the House bill, even if passed, would give 3 weeks to work out a border compromise. Why wait 3 weeks? Do it now. No time like the present.
@SenThomTillis This is the right path. Dems can and should negotiate down from the numbers in the POTUS' bill. But negotiate they must. Continuing to keep the government shut down due solely to wall opposition is untenable.
@IvanKaramazovD @SenThomTillis Maybe read the article instead of immediately springing to your partisan talking points. Just a thought.
@brianschatz Glad to hear you'll be voting yes on both bills.
@WSJ Is there any truth to the rumor Roo is the bastard child of Microsoft's Clippy?
@Craigwigg @brianschatz EACH SIDE MAKING CONCESSIONS. POTUS comes down from his number, Dems come up from theirs, we meet in the middle, re-open government, and move on. It's very easy if you abandon the hashtags and care about getting something done.
@Craigwigg @brianschatz com¬∑pro¬∑mise	/Ààk√§mpr…ôÀåmƒ´z/	noun	1.	an agreement or a settlement of a dispute that is reached by each side making concessions.
@TippyTop8 @NewsHour I agree. That's why Dems have to come off that position and negotiate down from the GOP number. A perfect compromise bill? $2.6B for walls. That's halfway between what each side wants. It's not rocket science. All it takes is the will to get it done.
@sdujka @SenSchumer @realDonaldTrump Me too. That's why all I care about is ending the thing. If it takes POTUS coming down on his number and Dems going up from their number, so be it. If no one's happy after this, we'll have done our job. That's how it works. No one gets everything they want.
@darrenrovell @gocaliva Well, it is a growth industry. &lt;rimshot&gt; I'll see myself out.
@brianschatz But no. You'll just keep on with the same nonsense because that's what your party tells you to do. You'll keep blaming rather than work on a compromise bill. Have an original thought. Be your own man. Your allegiance is first to the country, then to party.
@brianschatz Senator, you're embarrassing yourself. You know full well you're going to vote no on the POTUS' bill to re-open government. You seem smart. I'm sure you know that. So why are you in effect lying? Why can't you square with the truth you're the same as them?
@brianschatz I look forward to your party being unable to get 60 votes for its bill on the floor today, then blaming the POTUS for it and waiting weeks and weeks longer for pressure to build on him. God forbid you compromise and end this now. I'm sure posturing for 2020 is worth it.
@JSeanballard @NewsHour There's one side: the United States. Period. There are times where it's OK to be partisan. This is not one of them. Now is the time to do what's needed to get where we need to go. If you even conceptualize a side in this, you're wrong, simple as that.
@okwxnut @SenSchumer @realDonaldTrump There are a lot of things in the world that shouldn't happen. They do. Adults deal with it. Whining about how unfair things are is for children. I'll let you figure out which you are.
@CaminoForCancer @SenatorShaheen @Sencollins @lisamurkowski @senatemajldr You're a partisan hack. Have an original thought for once in your life. Good day, dullard.
@sdujka @SenSchumer @realDonaldTrump If he vetoes, Congress overrides. That's all it takes. One day of compromise where each side gets something they want in exchange for giving up something. Very simple. All it requires is putting country before party.
@sdujka @SenSchumer @realDonaldTrump A bill's already been passed that guarantees workers back pay. In effect, the loans are federally guaranteed. We have two bills on the Senate floor today to end the shutdown. POTUS need do nothing. Congress can merge the two bills into a bipartisan bill, send it on, and it's done
@NewsHour It's really quite easy. You craft a compromise bill that can get 60 votes, send it to POTUS, and the shutdown's over. All it takes is for Senators to put country before party. Doesn't sound that hard, does it?
@SenSchumer @realDonaldTrump Seriously - why can't they take out loans? It's a legitimate question. Perhaps you could answer that question instead of being snarky.
@CaminoForCancer @SenatorShaheen @Sencollins @lisamurkowski @senatemajldr I really love incoherency. Do you want no wall or do you want the government open? You can't have both. That's in the real world, anyway. I'm not sure what the rules are in the blue-tinged world you appear to be living in.
@SenatorShaheen Senator, I'm pleased to inform you two bills will be voted on today which would re-open government. Once both fail to get 60 votes, you and your colleagues can come up with a compromise bill that will get 60 votes so long as you put country before party.
@fox5dc @drabtshirt I am sure everyone is sending you this but..... @BigOandDukes @chaddukes
@SInow Can you imagine having that attitude when your record was 3-36? What an asshole.
@JulieYAli @ABC He‚Äôs in Colorado. We claim him as a United States citizen.
@maggieNYT @KenTremendous Dare we say - maturation?
@WSJ I‚Äôve got a strong ‚Äúbox game‚Äù, if you know what I‚Äôm saying.
@jakesin5 @SpeakerPelosi @realDonaldTrump Tomorrow never knows, as the Beatles once sang. Let‚Äôs see what happens. Perhaps some sort of miracle will occur.
@jakesin5 @SpeakerPelosi @realDonaldTrump If it happens, it‚Äôll be wild.
@jakesin5 @SpeakerPelosi @realDonaldTrump He is mercurial. I‚Äôll grant you that.
@DeathbyPropofol @KenTremendous Let me first say, that is a cheeky handle. Also, yes - all sex will now be foreplay and afterglow only.
@zenhighwayman @nabi_omid @SpeakerPelosi He loses everything. Good day, sir! RIP Gene Wilder.
@JFD8 @KenTremendous I took it with 20 Miller Lites. How might that affect things?
@erockradio @AndyRichter @TeamCoco @ConanOBrien I think you press X to start the lap dance. I could be wrong.
@erockradio @AndyRichter @TeamCoco @ConanOBrien This is completely true.
@DarcyCarden Your performance in mins 16-17 of Barry Ep 1 - esp the yes/no - is just amazing. I‚Äôm a fan.
@Cutlets79 @KenTremendous What‚Äôs your analysis on the ladders?
@JaR45 @KenTremendous Thanks, man. I love you too.
@ghoti00 @KenTremendous Truly one of the worst performances in Twitter history. I‚Äôd like to thank my mom &amp; dad &amp; the academy. I‚Äôll see myself off stage.
@ghoti00 @KenTremendous Hoisted by my own petard. I concede.
@jzikah @victoriaO1234 @brianschatz Good luck with that. I‚Äôm hopeful @MargotRobbie will accept my proposal for a date. We can both wait with bated breath for the outcome.
@ghoti00 @KenTremendous How dare you use truth against me, sir. The nerve!
@ghoti00 @KenTremendous That truth really hurts me. It‚Äôs so god damn accurate.
@JaR45 @KenTremendous I blame the imminent end of the NFL season for my malaise. If they‚Äôd just make the season longer I wouldn‚Äôt be so cantankerous.
@JaR45 @KenTremendous It‚Äôs true. I don‚Äôt. But y‚Äôall have fun. I‚Äôm sorry I laid my wet blanket upon you. I hope you can find it in your heart to forgive me.
@KenTremendous It‚Äôs true. God bless you, Ken.
@klberney @FindingAnswers @SpeakerPelosi @senatemajldr Yep. Deal with reality on reality‚Äôs terms. Also, it doesn‚Äôt really matter who ‚Äúowns‚Äù the shutdown. Fed workers are hurt regardless of who we blame.
@MichaelRWeis @iolantherosa @SpeakerPelosi Perhaps. I‚Äôd prefer an immediate Senate compromise bill that the POTUS will sign. If you prefer waiting weeks longer for a win, maybe that‚Äôll work. I wouldn‚Äôt bank on it.
@FakeRudyMartzke @TimBrando I miss Verne Lundquist.
@MichaelRWeis @iolantherosa @SpeakerPelosi They won‚Äôt. It‚Äôs widely known. CNN, which is not Trump-friendly, acknowledges both bills are DOA. That‚Äôs reality.
@DaniyalAzhar8 @TheSteinLine who‚Äôs. I don‚Äôt watch the current NBA. It‚Äôs nonsense. I watch real sports like football and boxing. You know, where men demolish each other instead of getting touched and having it called a foul.
@jakesin5 @SpeakerPelosi @realDonaldTrump He‚Äôs already said he‚Äôll veto the House bill. Try and keep up.
@Sunny_Duggineni @SpeakerPelosi Agreed. The Senate should craft a compromise bill. I‚Äôm not confident they will given the rhetoric going back and forth.
@nogmador1 @klberney @FindingAnswers @SpeakerPelosi @senatemajldr And then that leaves us where? Either forge a compromise or more shutdown. I‚Äôll take the former. Methinks you‚Äôd prefer more shutdown.
@OK_Dumbass @brianschatz Go watch literally any news channel or any news web site. Everyone knows both are DOA. Sorry to interrupt your blue-tinged dream with reality.
@SethDavisHoops It‚Äôs one thing if a player clearly holds on. When it‚Äôs both ways, I cannot understand how it‚Äôs flagrant. But hey, you‚Äôre the CBB genius so I guess it was what it was.
@SethDavisHoops I don‚Äôt follow CBB closely but I was puzzled. I saw zero ‚Äúlocking‚Äù on Brown‚Äôs part. What I saw was two men with arms mutually entangled, one of whom flailed away and hit the deck. Maybe I‚Äôm dumb. I did not get it. Seemed like result-oriented reffing.
@TheSteinLine He was busy winning rings.
@tobyveach @SpeakerPelosi The metaphor makes no sense since the Senate has to get 60 votes on a bill to advance it. If you care about coherence.
@supes8hope @SpeakerPelosi That‚Äôs how negotiation works. Well said.
@msibarra03 @SpeakerPelosi It‚Äôs not up to him to respond. The Senate needs 60 votes to move either bill forward. That won‚Äôt happen.
@ThePowerofOne98 @SpeakerPelosi @PressSec No.
@Sunny_Duggineni @SpeakerPelosi Neither will get 60 votes in the Senate.
@jakesin5 @SpeakerPelosi @realDonaldTrump He can‚Äôt accept anything until one of the bills gets 60 votes. That won‚Äôt happen.
@OVOJosh @SpeakerPelosi @IzzyxRivera91 That sounds like a great way to govern.
@iolantherosa @SpeakerPelosi Except for that pesky need to get 60 votes in the Senate, which won‚Äôt happen. Otherwise, spot on.
@45_panthers @SpeakerPelosi Wait. Is his monument the 654 miles of wall we already have or the 224 additional miles he wants to build? I‚Äôm confused.
@nabi_omid @SpeakerPelosi Well, he won the election for President. I‚Äôm hoping you can fill in the rest.
@klberney @FindingAnswers @SpeakerPelosi @senatemajldr He‚Äôs bringing the House bill to the Senate floor, which addresses your quibble. It won‚Äôt get 60 votes.
@JMonaco3 @SpeakerPelosi That‚Äôs a great way to get things done in DC.
@nana2hallie @SpeakerPelosi Close the deal? Are you high? We all know both bills to be brought up tomorrow are DOA.
@KrissyCougar @SpeakerPelosi @realDonaldTrump Can you explain what this means? Because everyone knows the House bill won‚Äôt get 60 votes tomorrow.
@The_Golden_Jew1 @SpeakerPelosi It‚Äôs really quite sad.
@jowanabueser @SpeakerPelosi By this you mean predicting passage of a bill that every sane person knows won‚Äôt get 60 votes?
@SpeakerPelosi Nance - not sure if you heard but it‚Äôs widely expected neither bill will get 60 votes. Thought you might appreciate this update. Best, me.
@demodisping @brianschatz Say hi to Picard for me.
@Sasquatchanon @Honda753 @brianschatz MM is putting both bills (Dems and POTUS) to the floor. Neither will get 60 votes.
@OK_Dumbass @brianschatz Hey, apparently you haven‚Äôt been paying attention, so: both the House and POTUS bills will be voted on. Neither are expected to get 60 votes.
@Maryc1850Sadler @brianschatz Daring people to multiply? You really do like to live dangerously.
@Advocate0914 @brianschatz Good luck with that.
@ChiefDivider @brianschatz Well, the president‚Äôs party controls the Senate, so there‚Äôs that.
@mrshellwinger @brianschatz Or, we can just fund government for a year and then we only have to do this once more before election time. Wacky idea, I know. It just may work.
@demodisping @brianschatz Which member of Congress are you, again?
@victoriaO1234 @brianschatz Do what, exactly?
@brianschatz Not if you do your job and work with your Senate colleagues to craft a compromise bill. Crazy idea, I know, but it just might work.
@nikkibreanne Good lord. I cant wait until she finds out.
@granthpaulsen Do it.
@joshuagates @united Great privacy.
@MikeDrucker @pattonoswalt Slytherins are people, too, Michael.
@realDonaldTrump Maybe do the first SOTU live-streamed on @Twitter. It would be very on-brand.
@AP It‚Äôs strange that the word ‚Äúillegal‚Äù can be both accurate and offensive. Hard to reconcile.
@grawlsy @KenTremendous Ouch. No shit, this seriously made me rethink my life choices. They‚Äôre bad. You‚Äôre right.
@grawlsy @KenTremendous Over the Knicks? Boy, that is something to crow about.
@KenTremendous I don‚Äôt understand why anyone watches regular season NBA games. There‚Äôs just no point. You can skip the entire regular season, tune in for the playoffs, and miss nothing of consequence.
@bballwriters And his team is 27-20. In case anyone cares about winning.
@SInow And yet the Rockets barely beat a bad Knicks team.
@helllord9 @ChrisMurphyCT Alrighty then.
@MoreSocialism @ChrisMurphyCT I have no words.
@SInow What I get from this is Wilt Chamberlain was f**king amazing. James Harden‚Äôs got a long way to go.
@KamalaHarris Wow. This from an account that basically spends 24/7 complaining about things.
@ChrisMurphyCT Can we just for a moment enjoy the fact that both parties agree with something POTUS did? The dream of being united might be on life support, but it still draws breath.
@NewsHour @SenatorRounds @JudyWoodruff I like the cut of Senator Rounds‚Äô jib.
@SenatorCantwell Work on a compromise Senate bill, Senator, if you care about ending the shutdown.
@NewsHour @SenatorRounds Compromise? Genius!
@cnni &lt;lengthy series of Trump-hating comments&gt;
@goa1433 @OutFrontCNN @CNN Most members of Congress are well off and wouldn‚Äôt be particularly impacted by missed checks - certainly not like average fed workers.
@OutFrontCNN @RepKatieHill ‚ÄúOpen to spending money on border security‚Äù is not going to get it done. Half barrier and half technology. That‚Äôs what‚Äôll get it done.
@cnni ‚ÄúNews‚Äù
@PattyMurray By ‚Äúwork with us‚Äù, you mean craft a bipartisan bill, right? Because ‚Äúvote for our bill‚Äù sounds more like a demand than working together.
@brianschatz Because it seems to me like if you draw a line between the two bills, that‚Äôs the solution. Now, I‚Äôm not a Senator. Maybe I‚Äôm a simpleton. But from the few brains cells I can rub together, that seems like the obvious way forward. Your thoughts?
@brianschatz By the way, now that MM is bringing two bills to the floor, that excuse is gone. Pray tell, what‚Äôs the next one? What on earth is preventing you from negotiating a compromise other than partisan enmity?
@iceberg171 @brianschatz And that does what to end the shutdown?
@brianschatz What, you tweeting incessantly while offering no shutdown solutions other than waiting and praying? Yes, I have.
@NewsHour @IAmAmnaNawaz I would love for you to do a feature as to whether Americans can start a @kickstarter campaign to fund the @TSA.
@funnydanny I say things that I find funny. Danny, I‚Äôm close to being you.
@FiveThirtyEight Wait a second. If you feel bad about yourself, it starts a downward spiral? You don‚Äôt say.
@RepKatieHill Watching you on CNN. You seem smart &amp; like you care. I hope you‚Äôll realize the one and only solution is a bipartisan compromise bill that gives each side something they want. It‚Äôs foolish to hope the Dem bill advances.
@leftybrawler @MarkWarner @PortCityBrew @TheDemocrats Because Canada is the United States North. Mexico ain‚Äôt. Moreover, Mexico is the only land way to get from Central America.
@leftybrawler @MarkWarner @PortCityBrew @TheDemocrats Then why do we have 700-some miles of barrier already there? You‚Äôre saying previous administrations engaged in useless fraud? Mr. Obama voted for useless fraud? Pray tell, what‚Äôs the deal?
@TomDaly2 Or open a new browser window. Christ.
@NewsHour @ChrisVanHollen @JudyWoodruff This is first-class nonsense. He‚Äôll have exactly one more chance to do this - one year from now. This is a man lying on TV.
@SenGillibrand What, refusing to do what‚Äôs needed to end the shutdown? Canceling the State of the Union? Haranguing Twitter with more partisan claptrap?
@tberry1501 @MarkWarner @PortCityBrew Yes, Senator. Wave your magic wand and make it happen!
@leftybrawler @MarkWarner @PortCityBrew @TheDemocrats would need to be open to wall funding for that to happen. They aren‚Äôt. As soon as they gain sanity and move off that position, a compromise will be easy.
@MarkWarner @PortCityBrew Work on a compromise bill. It‚Äôs the only way. If you care about your constituents above your party leadership, that‚Äôs what you must do. There is no other option.
@SenWhitehouse @realDonaldTrump Keep on name-calling and pandering to your base. I‚Äôm sure that‚Äôs going to help this country move on.
@ABC He can‚Äôt, but hey, if lying works for one side, might as well try it yourself.
@SenatorHassan @SenatorShaheen Senator, it‚Äôs as if you have a crystal ball. GOP Senators have a bill to re-open government. Good news! Now that they‚Äôre at the table, I trust you‚Äôll take care of the rest.
@BernieSanders Software engineers, unionize! The six figure salaries you're getting paid are an illusion! You need the union so a mediocre worker who's been there 30 years can get paid more than you! No incentive to work any harder than needed to avoid getting fired! SWEET!
@BernieSanders No chance the end result is less innovation and mediocre workers! After all remember how at the peak of automotive unions we put out garbage cars and got our asses handed to us by Japan! YAY! Bring it on! Woooooooo!
@BernieSanders That's right, unions! Where you get paid based on how long you've been there rather than how well you do your job! Yay! As a younger, high-performing worker, naturally I'm all for this! Feel the Bern!
@MarieLDubois1 @SusanRockwell10 @SenWhitehouse @realDonaldTrump Right. They'll vote to support the POTUS bill, Dems will vote to support the House bill, and neither will get 60 votes. Are you so out of touch that you don't understand that POTUS/wall are VERY popular in most red states? Deal with reality on reality's terms.
@cnnbrk Do we really need one? We know what the state of the union is: broken.
@SenatorHassan How about you work on a consensus proposal that bridges the gap between the POTUS bill and Dem bill and actually get something done? What's that? You'd rather put pressure on the GOP than do something? Ah. Wish you'd said that up front.
@XMalice @ABC Good to know we have you to consult as an oracle to determine what is and is not thinking versus falling in step. And to think, I was worried! Phew.
@SenSanders We're also the only country with 20 aircraft carriers. Therefore, as a modest proposal, we ought to sink 16 of them so we have as many as Japan and France. It simply won't do not to be like everyone else.
@ABC "And by strong, I mean one that does what I say".
@brianschatz Neither bill is going to get 60 votes on the floor. Craft a compromise if you actually care about ending the shutdown.
@chaddukes @BigOandDukes @sternpinballinc @JJPinball Maybe you could charge $100 per horde member to have their names inscribed on it or something like that. I'd definitely pay $100 for that. Could help defray the cost.
@SenSchumer How are we going to "resolve our differences" when your @SpeakerPelosi said no wall, not ever? Doesn't sound like you have any intent to negotiate. If you do, maybe say that instead of no wall, not ever. Just a thought.
@MarkWarner They won't, so let's go ahead and start crafting a compromise bill now rather than continue to waste time.
@SenateDems You're saying not getting paid hurts people? I'll not believe it.
@PaulaRoyce @SenWhitehouse @realDonaldTrump Not going to happen. Neither the Dem bill nor the POTUS bill will get 60 votes. Cross your fingers all you want, insult Trump all you want, but that's reality. Either deal with it or get out of the way and let other people solve the problem.
@CBSNews What about killing your 30 year old kid who won't move out?
@KenTremendous No shit - I felt a palpable weight lifting off me. This is what the world should be. You write genius TV and mock baseball. This is good. This is right. This is my happy place. God bless. I‚Äôm right again.
@KenTremendous You covering baseball content makes me happy.
@meekamooka1 @SenWhitehouse @realDonaldTrump It won‚Äôt get that far. Neither bill will get 60 votes. We all know this.
@PostSports THANK YOU!
@NeverAgain4560 @SenWhitehouse @realDonaldTrump No.
@Eric_Kumah11 @AndyBitterVT Thanks for the good memories, EK, &amp; best of luck with your future.
@catmomus @CNNPolitics Hey, thanks for staying on topic! Glad you didn‚Äôt hijack the thread with your own axe to grind. Good stuff!
@pattonoswalt @NBCAPBio Feed this man.
@brianschatz You‚Äôre going to vote on two bills. Maybe try and craft a compromise bill that will get 60 votes? Wacky idea, I know, but it‚Äôs just crazy enough to work.
@DPAQreport @brianschatz @Reinlwapo @JStein_WaPo Workers not getting paid impacts their ability to pay bills? Well, this is news!
@CNNPolitics Blazer with zippered vest is a tragically bad look.
@SenatorTomUdall @SenateDems Good luck with that, Senator.
@SInow Looks homeless.
@NewsHour @MarciaCoyle The only reason the SCOTUS took this case is to expand Heller/McDonald beyond the home.
@SusanRockwell10 @SenWhitehouse @realDonaldTrump By the way, if you‚Äôre going to throw around terms like ‚Äúemotionally retarded man baby‚Äù and ‚Äúcorrupt monster‚Äù, stay out of this conversation. You can‚Äôt get past your emotion. I‚Äôve no time for that.
@SusanRockwell10 @SenWhitehouse @realDonaldTrump No, he‚Äôs not. Two bills - one POTUS, one Dem - will be voted on. He‚Äôs no longer keeping government closed. Neither has the votes. Want government re-opened ASAP? Encourage your representatives to forge a compromise.
@SusanRockwell10 @SenWhitehouse @realDonaldTrump But at least your side didn‚Äôt cave. That‚Äôs what really matters, right?
@SusanRockwell10 @SenWhitehouse @realDonaldTrump In any rational time there would be a compromise. Now? Both sides will blame the other and it‚Äôll be another month of shutdown.
@SusanRockwell10 @SenWhitehouse @realDonaldTrump Hope all you want. It won‚Äôt accomplish anything.
@SusanRockwell10 @SenWhitehouse @realDonaldTrump Dems would need 13 flips to make it. Not happening.
@SusanRockwell10 @SenWhitehouse @realDonaldTrump Read any sober analysis. Both are DOA.
@SusanRockwell10 @SenWhitehouse @realDonaldTrump They won‚Äôt. Everyone knows.
@SusanRockwell10 @SenWhitehouse @realDonaldTrump Ok. They‚Äôll vote, neither bill will get 60 votes, and the shutdown goes on. Awesome.
@PattyMurray You‚Äôll have 2 bills to vote on. Make it happen.
@john_keim TANK
@WSJ Snipers. Kill on sight.
@SenWhitehouse @realDonaldTrump And even if one does, POTUS can veto. Maybe you should work on a compromise bill. If you remember what that word means, that is.
@SenWhitehouse @realDonaldTrump Neither‚Äò s going to get 60 votes.
@cnni Maenwhile, in the States, hundreds of thousands are going unpaid with nary a sign of any misuse of heavy machinery.
@MarkWarner How about you do something to make it happen rather than opining daily about how someone else should do something?
@darrenrovell @TraversWDSU Shocking that an attorney is wasting time and money.
@CNNPolitics The Shutdown: F**k It, Let's Go The Whole Year!

@KamalaHarris How about you end the shutdown first? Seems maybe a tad more important. Oh, I know, blame Mitch. Awesome stuff.
@FiveThirtyEight At this point it might as well be called the Black Party.
@richeisen Here's the safety net. Block Donte Fowler, don't throw an INT, go down the field, get a FG. I cannot believe how much whining this play has engendered. Blaming one play is for losers. Saints had every opportunity to win the game. They didn't. Stop blaming refs. Look in the mirror
@KenTremendous The people responsible for sacking the people who were responsible have been sacked.
@tedlieu @realDonaldTrump DO SOMETHING OTHER THAN TWEET FOR CHRIST‚ÄôS SAKE!
@MeetThePress @HeidiNBC @alivitali I‚Äôll save you the time - no.
@SenatorCantwell Oh, you strongly urged? Well now. I expect immediate re-opening.
@cnni By the way, if you go to China, you‚Äôre an idiot. It‚Äôs a terrible country.
@cnni Waste of time. He doesn‚Äôt care.
@FletcherWDSU @LATimesfarmer @NOPDNews @LAPDHQ @NFL @wdsu Good to know there are no crimes in need of solving.
@tedlieu @AmericanLegion @POTUS @realDonaldTrump Hey, maybe if you say that a trillion times something will happen. Wild idea - STOP TWEETING AND DO SOMETHING.
@brianschatz Or, just admit it‚Äôs a nonsense PR war and your only action is waiting and hoping. But be honest.
@brianschatz Christ. If this were WW2 we‚Äôd have a million tweets bemoaning Hitler while he took over all of Europe. Be a man. Act.
@brianschatz Never has a party urged action and done less.
@brianschatz THEN STOP IT. Tweeting accomplished nothing. DO SOMETHING. Your words do nothing.
@brianschatz More sound and fury signifying nothing.
@KenTremendous Glad we‚Äôre focusing on this instead of solving the government shutdown. Priorities, right?
@Oregon_birds @Circe321 @RepSwalwell @SenMajLdr Now? I‚Äôm fucked. Two extreme parties.  A sane person has nowhere to go.
@Oregon_birds @Circe321 @RepSwalwell @SenMajLdr By the way, I‚Äôm a Democrat. Or was one, before the party decided to become Socialism Lite.
@Oregon_birds @Circe321 @RepSwalwell @SenMajLdr ‚ÄúThem‚Äù to refer to your fellow Americans. This is how you know the country‚Äôs fucked.
@Circe321 @Oregon_birds @RepSwalwell @SenMajLdr But hey, enjoy the partisan grandstanding. Yeehaw! Good times.
@Circe321 @Oregon_birds @RepSwalwell @SenMajLdr Passing a Dem bill to re-open gov‚Äôt is like me passing a bill to have the girl I used to be with get back with me.  Dead on arrival. Pointless.
@CatPressMax @Reuters The Chinese Communist party runs all three. Call me when that changes.
@Oregon_birds @RepSwalwell @SenMajLdr Not that you care. Clearly you‚Äôre a partisan. So, I‚Äôve wasted my words. Good times.
@Oregon_birds @RepSwalwell @SenMajLdr But hey, MM bad. Look! I did something to end the shutdown!
@Oregon_birds @RepSwalwell @SenMajLdr I drank 200 beers in that time. I contributed as much as the good Rep. Neither of us contributed a god damn thing toward ending the shutdown.
@Oregon_birds @RepSwalwell @SenMajLdr So, nothing.
@CatPressMax @Reuters So, China.
@TedLeonsis Fire Ernie Grunfeld.
@theMMQB @McCannSportsLaw Way to go out on a limb.
@stoolpresidente In a world full of assholes, you just might be the biggest. Congrats!
@RepSwalwell I‚Äôll wait.
@RepSwalwell Name one thing you‚Äôre doing to end the shutdown other than tweeting anti-GOP messages and waiting.
@Reuters China is a cancer on the world.
@valeriegauvain @cpier55 Reach for the stars
@DNWilson1991 @BBCWorld Haha. Fair play.
@DaveRodecap @SenWhitehouse I don‚Äôt know. My life is awesome. Does that count?
@Reuters Like the problem of ungodly high ratings?
@ChappellTracker Rehab
@jerzyboi2 @BBCWorld I‚Äôm trolling. Christ.
@AmandaGallipeau @qhRd0oVXuKgqmUT @SenGillibrand Thanks for the civics lesson, you condescending hag.
@DNWilson1991 @BBCWorld Hey, after a no-deal Brexit, we‚Äôre going to be your f**king daddy. Enjoy!
@ABC By the way, maybe a woman who isn‚Äôt on TV should lead the charge? Nah, you‚Äôre right. The hot should lead the charge. They really get what it‚Äôs like to be ugly.
@ABC I kicked a cat! Yay!
@ABC I hate women and I love myself! Yay!
@ABC I shot a man to watch him die! I‚Äôm amazing! Yay!
@ABC You‚Äôre 500 pounds! You‚Äôre amazing! Yay!
@ABC I just drank 20 beers. I‚Äôm amazing! Yay!
@JSatyre @ABC Seriously. Hey, I‚Äôm mad women won‚Äôt date me because I‚Äôm poor! Oh cruel world! Everyone is amazing! We‚Äôre all awesome! Socialism! Yay!
@ABC Yes. Stop shaming me about my gut, lack of friends, and alcohol intake! It‚Äôs loser-shaming! How dare the world!
@ABC If only I could get paid for stifling innovation and economic growth.
@ABC Anyone want to tell ol‚Äô Spike about the crime rate in Mexico?
@RepSwalwell @TSA If only you could do something about it. Wait, you can. Maybe stop tweeting the party line and work on solutions.
@BBCWorld * mom
@DaveRodecap @SenWhitehouse That‚Äôs right. How dare the SCOTUS use its Constitutional powers? The nerve.
@SenWhitehouse By the way, have some balls and tell John Roberts to fuck off instead of pansy-ass side insults. How about a duel on the Capital Lawn?
@SenWhitehouse Yes. Sleazy corporations like the ones most of us work for. Huzzah!
@BernieSanders Yes to quotas!
@NewsHour @amyewalter @JudyWoodruff Good to know centrists no longer have a party.
@NewsHour @IAmAmnaNawaz Maybe it‚Äôs the anti-semitism? Wild guess.
@JudyWoodruff @NewsHour Why not just say I want to take money from the rich and give it to everyone else? Be honest.
@NewsHour @ljgliha @rmpbs Allow me to enlighten: you feel good. Don‚Äôt drive or operate heavy machinery. That‚Äôs all.
@BrendanKutyNJ Humor doesn‚Äôt suit you.
@JustinVerlander Dude, you‚Äôre awesome.
@BrandonHarris_ @SenSchumer Yeah! Let‚Äôs keep the shutdown going for years! No one needs that pesky TSA!
@csd @SenSchumer Yes, it‚Äôs really producing results. Why, at this rate we can keep government shut down a year!
@SenSchumer You mean injustice like forcing federal workers to work without paychecks while you incessantly tweet the party line and do nothing?
@NewsHour I don‚Äôt know why it‚Äôs not 10 of 10. They should walk off the job.
@qhRd0oVXuKgqmUT @SenGillibrand That‚Äôs right. Corporations are groups of people.
@PattyMurray It presumes workers are identical units. That‚Äôs for Soviet Russia. Here in the USA, maybe you get what you‚Äôre worth?
@PattyMurray Is that really true? Maybe the guy next to me sucks at his job. Maybe I go up and he goes down. Maybe that‚Äôs the way it should be.
@SenGillibrand So you‚Äôre right and the Supreme Court is wrong? Good to know you believe in separation of powers, Senator.
@SkySportsBoxing Stop with the nonsense and make it happen.
@chaddukes Play the hits.
@Mariners Great move, Jer man.
@dominos Try pineapple and jalape√±o. A study in contrast.
@WilliamShatner I‚Äôd take a hug from you, sir.
@MarkWarner Naturally, Senator, you‚Äôre working on a plan to end the shutdown rather than waiting out the GOP, right?
@realDonaldTrump I didn‚Äôt vote for him, but he‚Äôs right.
@AndrewOrrino @CNNPolitics Seriously. Is the bar really that low?
@blondtomz @brianschatz @senatemajldr @MargotRobbie And here I thought the job was to do right by the country. Thanks for letting me know it‚Äôs to blame everyone else. Good stuff!
@jaketapper @KenTremendous @voxdotcom This kinda seems to undercut his moral authority, doesn‚Äôt it?
@jaketapper @KenTremendous @voxdotcom ‚ÄúThe surveillance failed to show that King was a communist, but it did result in many tapes of extramarital sexual liaisons by King.‚Äù ????
@wellguesswhat @darrenrovell @Redskins @dallascowboys @tonyromo I know. Allow me my desperate hopes, please. It‚Äôs all I have as a Skins fan.
@blondtomz @brianschatz @senatemajldr @MargotRobbie So the job of a Senator is to wait for things to happen? Good to know.
@IkonPass @Deer_Valley Raclette?
@blondtomz @brianschatz @senatemajldr @MargotRobbie And by the way: I AGREE WITH YOU. I‚Äôd like MM to bring a bill to the floor to end this. But he‚Äôs not. He just isn‚Äôt. Either you accept that and work to find a solution, or you deny it and live outside reality. It‚Äôs that simple.
@blondtomz @brianschatz @senatemajldr Thanks for the civics lesson, Thor. Here‚Äôs the problem: MM said he‚Äôs not going to bring anything to the floor without POTUS/Dem agreement. I‚Äôd like to f**k @MargotRobbie. Same chance of that as MM changing his mind. Live in reality, sir.
@timkaine Counterpoint: on the other side of the border there‚Äôs rampant kidnapping and fuel theft and narco-terrorism. What, pray tell, did Dr. King say about that?
@blondtomz @brianschatz @senatemajldr Of course, he‚Äôs not allowed to do that, because Pelosi and Schumer won‚Äôt have it. They‚Äôre more interested in scoring political points than getting anything done.
@blondtomz @brianschatz @senatemajldr How about he puts together a counteroffer? By the way, MM will absolutely call a vote. It just needs POTUS/Dem agreement.
@devontafreeman @AtlantaFalcons This. In a country where seemingly everyone wants us to be divided, it‚Äôs on us to come together as brothers and sisters.
@brianschatz You‚Äôre doing nothing to end the shutdown aside from constantly tweeting the party line.
@carlruiz You, sir, are a monster.
@SenGillibrand @TheRevAl Counterpoint: Tawana Brawley.
@geoffschwartz And your point is right. Stop whining. You had a chance. It‚Äôs not the NFL‚Äôs fault you couldn‚Äôt stop them (Chiefs) or couldn‚Äôt block Dante Fowler (Saints).
@NotMrTibbs Probably people who think closers and World Series wins are overvalued.
@meganamram Trump dumb yay!
@Raggs_No_Riches @dcsportsbog Does this come as some sort of surprise?
@AndrewBrandt And remember: plenty of huge soccer matches are settled with penalty kicks. The NFL may not have it exactly right, but it‚Äôs nowhere near the least fair way to decide OT games.
@CNNPolitics It was actually rejected three days before it was made. True story.
@danieldaekim @RamsNFL I don‚Äôt know why, but everything sounds more dramatic in a language you don‚Äôt understand. Kudos to those broadcasters.
@tedlieu Clearly wall-to-wall identity politics is what he had in mind.
@SenGillibrand If you get the Dem nomination I‚Äôm staying home in 2020.
@darrenrovell You misspelled ‚Äúdegenerate gamblers‚Äù.
@Patriots It‚Äôs not that hard to write Instagram.
@CBSNews @KamalaHarris That‚Äôs gonna be a whole lot of listening, because she talks 24/7.
@whatmenwant I‚Äôll tell you what they want: not to see this movie.
@FloydMayweather I‚Äôm watching your fight vs @OscarDeLaHoya for the first time on @DAZN_USA. You coming out in the colors of Mexico with a big hat might be the greatest thing I‚Äôve ever seen in boxing.
@benshpigel @Kunk7 If you‚Äôre into being sore losers. How about they blame whatever OL failed to contain Fowler and forced the INT? Typical New Orleans. Always someone else‚Äôs fault.
@benshpigel Alternate headline: The Crescan‚Äôt City
@DAZN_USA Love the great fights from the vault. I‚Äôm 3 in. I would seriously watch them 24/7 if there were enough to last that long.
@goldy881 @darrenrovell Competitive spirit. Some men enjoy that.
@darrenrovell Come to the @Redskins and stick it to the @dallascowboys twice a year, @tonyromo.
@WSJ Sucks having competition, doesn‚Äôt it?
@ByMikeJones This is the greatest day of all days.
@AdamSchefter The NFL owns all other sports leagues.
@cnni Let them kill each other.
@RealMikeWilbon Not a single person is going to stop watching the NFL.
@richeisen If a walrus was a genius....
@chaddukes 2.0
@YahooForde That‚Äôs the key. Should NEVER have happened.
@PeteMedhurst @NFLOfficiating In the end, it‚Äôs up to players to play through calls. Blaming officials is the loser‚Äôs way out.
@Rodger_Saffold @RamsNFL Celebrate good times come on!
@BuckyBrooks @Chiefs ... and done.
@drummondcreek @RobertKlemko @theMMQB @CFL Yes, the CFL, that storied league.
@RobertKlemko @theMMQB Blaming a loss on one play is a loser‚Äôs argument.
@ItsMattLawson @BigOandDukes Ant ‚ÄúThe Nigerian Nightmare‚Äù Knee
@LRiddickESPN Belichick is a strategic genius.
@cbakerswaggy Donte Fowler Jr play of the game. Great spin off the pass rush to get to Brees.
@LATimesfarmer Makes as much sense to me either way.
@LATimesfarmer Mr. Fave-ree.
@chaddukes Haha. Ol‚Äô Cajun Injector.
@BaldyNFL @RamsNFL Have to kick. Defense playing well in 2H.
@markschlereth This is the sign for the HC to call a TO.
@KamalaHarris Everyone gets everything. Yay!
@SenSanders Good. Government is a failure.
@CraigHoffman The NFL isn‚Äôt known for rules coherence.
@ConorOrr @SInow What a waste of life.
@LRiddickESPN He shoots the gap like no other.
@theMMQB Let‚Äôs start a kickstarter to put a bounty on this man‚Äôs head.
@CharlesRobinson I‚Äôll send you $20.
@SInow Really breaking some news here. Drew Brees is good. What‚Äôs your stance on Jerry Rice? He alright too?
@Saints Your city was once know for jazz and now this.
@chaddukes The Hurricane?
@chaddukes Drabber?
@cbakerswaggy And they get the ball to start the second half. That bomb to Cooks could be the play that turned the game around.
@MikeWiseguy Never has a man‚Äôs last name been more inappropriate.
@LATimesfarmer Today, I‚Äôm a Rams fan.
@brianschatz I‚Äôd love to know if I can give a $20 bill to every TSA employee. If you‚Äôre not going to do anything, I will.
@AndrewBrandt He was funny as the Booze Cruise captain on The Office. Downhill since IMHO.
@DonGeronimoShow Yes. A ton of them.
@JeffSchultzATL @LATimesfarmer Like the rest of New Orleans.
@HawthornePhill1 @cnni Amen, sir.
@cnni Why are we listening to either of them?
@KamalaHarris Go watch football like the rest of America, for God‚Äôs sake.
@markschlereth How is that good for the game? It‚Äôs like an MLB stadium having a 500‚Äô center field. It‚Äôs not the same game.
@jkatzenstein @Saints Wait a second. 60k drunk Cajuns are loud in a dome? This truly is breaking news.
@wingoz It‚Äôs bad for the game. You want the best team to win, not the one who can construct a bandbox with a dome where Cajuns can make the most noise.
@AlbertBreer You want the best team to win. Not the one who has the least noise.
@AlbertBreer This is ludicrous. There are people blowing whistles in the stands. There‚Äôs home field advantage and there‚Äôs unfair.
@BuckyBrooks Buck, you and @MoveTheSticks gotta get an Xes and Oes show.
@AlbertBreer Agree. Goff is nervous so far. Best way to settle him down is to get Gurley going and work off play action.
@ABC He‚Äôs not wrong.
@RobLowe @mentalsamurai It looked like a giant Rube Goldberg machine. Color me intrigued.
@AndrewBrandt You other owners can‚Äôt deny
@SteveKerr Thanks for contributing to the fracturing of our country, coach. Good stuff.
@AndrewBrandt Rams and Chiefs would be perfect given that they played what was clearly the best regular season game this year.
@FiveThirtyEight Slackbot is the type of straightforward, no-nonsense leadership this country desperately needs. I look forward to his 2020 campaign.
@SenSanders Boooooooooooooooooooo
@FrankCaliendo He kinda has a Jon Gruden face. Maybe he picked it up from you. Adorable!
@SportsCenter @ESPNNFL @AdamSchefter More breaking news: the sun rose today. ‚òÄÔ∏è
@da_wessel @TheDemocrats Doom and gloom is the new ‚Äúif it bleeds, it leads‚Äù. We‚Äôre fine. Economy‚Äôs humming along. Have some faith in your country, you turncoat.
@NaturesPoisons People pay for tattoos like that. You got yours the right way.
@markschlereth I tried finding it when I was in Beaver Creek - no luck. I will try harder in the future.
@SenatorBaldwin Great plan, Senator!
@WSJ Have @realDonaldTrump tweet them out. I guarantee that will reach every American.
@J_No24 @NFLonFOX @FOXSports Lookin‚Äô good man.
@timmarchman @KenTremendous There‚Äôs not a single thing about any high school in America anyone needs to know about.
@MarkArmour04 Counterpoint: sticks and stones may break my bones but words will never hurt me.
@CNNPolitics We‚Äôre gonna limit it to just one? Whooooo boy.
@louise_q10 @HouseDemocrats Sorry, no. A physical barrier is an adjunct to these. Even with technology, you need to slow people down to deal with them. That‚Äôs why we already have 700 miles of barrier along the southern border.
@HouseDemocrats Really excited about this shutdown lasting months and months. Yay team! We‚Äôre on the right track, baby.
@Runningman429 @SenDuckworth Unfortunately, Dems appear to be choosing the opposite path. It‚Äôs full on resistance. I fear POTUS is going to go full-on Vader and slash and burn and it‚Äôs gonna be very, very ugly. Perhaps I‚Äôm wrong. But there is an argument to be made for appeasement.
@Runningman429 @SenDuckworth Think of it like a bad relationship. You gotta live together two more years. You want to send the other person on the warpath and make life a living hell? Sometimes discretion is the better part of valor.
@Runningman429 @SenDuckworth If for no other reason, the POTUS can make the next two years scorched earth. Seriously - imagine a really angry Trump. You want that? You want him to go crazy? Knowing he‚Äôs a madman, maybe don‚Äôt set him off and wait 2 years to replace him.
@Runningman429 @SenDuckworth Look, you‚Äôre not wrong per se, but that‚Äôs the nature of politics. You can wish it to be otherwise, and maybe you‚Äôre right, but don‚Äôt be surprised when reality doesn‚Äôt bend to your will. Pejoratives won‚Äôt change that. Plenty were spilled at Clinton/Obama to no effect.
@CBSNews Also, the sun rose.
@cnnbrk I want out of this country. Everyone‚Äôs racist and everything‚Äôs insulting and everyone is terrible and I want to put a gun to my head and end it all. Christ.
@andrewkimmel @pattonoswalt @ka_ya11 He‚Äôs not wrong.
@lizdrabick ‚ÄúYou do know my undercarriage is the height of a puddle, don‚Äôt you?‚Äù
@SenGillibrand ** all the people who agree with me
@Runningman429 @SenDuckworth Also, you‚Äôre ignoring a fundamental change that occurred between now and then, which is the POTUS changing his mind. I‚Äôm sure you hate him with the fire of a thousand suns, but he‚Äôs the POTUS. His party‚Äôs going to follow his lead. To expect otherwise is to deny reality.
@Runningman429 @SenDuckworth And by the way, all due respect to Sen. Duckworth, but does war hero mean you always get what you want? She has one vote. I like her a lot, I respect her, but a vote is what it is - one vote. She can bully pulpit forever. It won‚Äôt change the calculus.
@Runningman429 @SenDuckworth He will.
@EllenDeane @SenDuckworth Why would they? A majority of the Senate is GOP.
@SenDuckworth He‚Äôs already said he‚Äôs going to bring up a ‚Äúcompromise‚Äù bill next week. I don‚Äôt think your hopes are realistic. Maybe start working on something rather than praying for a miracle.
@ananavarro Counterpoint: the country‚Äôs a dumpster fire. Do we really need to pour gas on that fire with viral videos we know are only going to make it worse?
@PattyMurray Senator, you must have missed it. Mitch said today he‚Äôs going to bring a compromise bill to the floor next week. God bless, we found him! It turns out it was fairly easy. Love, Me.
@SenatorCantwell ‚ÄúI encouraged @MargotRobbie to accept my proposal for a date‚Äù. We‚Äôve both got a shot, Senator Cantwell.
@SenatorCantwell And to think, you could have used that time to do something more useful, like watch grass grow or paint dry.
@RonWyden Senator, if you‚Äôre going to throw stones, maybe be prepared to talk about what you‚Äôre doing to re-open government instead of vomiting party talking points that get us nowhere. Shame on you.
@BarryMacDoubleU @Nmondey7 @lisamurkowski There‚Äôs no point in talking to you. Your mind‚Äôs made up and you‚Äôre not open to new ideas. Is that what it means to be a liberal? I always thought it was a marketplace of ideas. It‚Äôs good to know it‚Äôs now just vomiting the party line. Good stuff.
@BarryMacDoubleU @lisamurkowski Re: the House - that‚Äôs a third. GOP controls Senate and OO. This notion that somehow winning the house means you get control is for dumbasses. Get with reality. Dems won the House. They didn‚Äôt win Senate or the presidency.
@BarryMacDoubleU @lisamurkowski If Pelosi said ‚Äúre-open gov‚Äôt and we‚Äôll work on border security, to include a substantial amount for a barrier‚Äù, then I‚Äôd agree with you. But she didn‚Äôt. That‚Äôs the problem. As soon as she shows a willingness to compromise, I‚Äôll join you.
@BarryMacDoubleU @lisamurkowski You‚Äôre missing the point. The whole ‚Äúre-open gov‚Äôt and then negotiate‚Äù presumes good-faith negotiations. If POTUS knows the negotiations are a sham, why should he re-open gov‚Äôt? It‚Äôs quid pro quo. If Dems aren‚Äôt willing to give, it‚Äôs a non-starter.
@Gregory81581469 @oldwomanandadog @SenSanders Another thing that didn‚Äôt exist - suicide hijackers.
@BarryMacDoubleU @lisamurkowski And then what? Pelosi‚Äòs already said she‚Äôs not going to give a dollar for the wall. What is there to negotiate?
@lisamurkowski Thank you, Senator. It‚Äôs good to know there‚Äôs at least one adult in the room.
@ABC This man is an American hero. Just amazing.
@JessicaValenti @pattonoswalt At the rate we‚Äôre going, 50 years from now we‚Äôll be a province of China.
@dargon_f @Yamiche @POTUS Bring it on. I can take it. I hate Trump. I can get past that and see what needs to be done for the good of the country. Apparently no one else can. They‚Äôd rather rant for/against Trump than get the fucking job done. You‚Äôre all a giant embarrassment, every one of you.
@dargon_f @Yamiche @POTUS I voted for her. I‚Äôve been a lifelong Democrat. No more. Both parties are dumpster fires. If you have an affiliation with either party, you‚Äôre wrong. And while you wait for something to happen, the country‚Äôs going into the shitter. Thanks!
@LizaBrings @RepSpanberger Yes - thanks for TSA employees going weeks and weeks without pay! Yay! Go Dems! Trump bad!
@RepSpanberger @HouseDemocrats I jacked off 8 times. That accomplished as much as your 8 votes - NOTHING. At least mine felt good.
@SenGillibrand At least it‚Äôs a deal, something your party has proven spectacularly unable to put forth. But hey, keep on blaming. I‚Äôm sure the workers going months without paychecks are 100% behind you. Awesome stuff, Senator.
@RepBarbaraLee @HouseDemocrats You‚Äôre saying the position that zero dollars will go to the wall is negotiation?
@TheDemocrats You‚Äôre making me ashamed I was a Democrat. Stop spewing your nonsense talking points and GET SOMETHING DONE.
@sponson @Yamiche Good news. Honestly, they should all walk out right now. The sooner they strike, the sooner the shutdown ends. There‚Äôs no other way out.
@trumpathetic @Yamiche No, I don‚Äôt. I don‚Äôt agree that we should bear any cost. This is a tiny budgetary matter, and if you think it‚Äôs worth air travel going into chaos to stop ‚Äúthe wall‚Äù when we already have 700 miles of it, you‚Äôre not smart.
@SenBlumenthal Great to hear you‚Äôre working on ending the shutdown, Senator. You, and every person in Congress and the POTUS, are an utter failure. Shame on you. Every single one of you. You‚Äôre an embarrassment.
@FrankNstein717 @CNNPolitics Polls, you fucking numbskull.
@CNNPolitics With good reason. The country‚Äôs a dumpster fire and all people can manage to spit out is nonsense partisan talking points. In truth, however, it‚Äôs YOU - the partisan idiots - that created this. Don‚Äôt blame Trump. Look in the mirror. That‚Äôs who‚Äôs killing the country. YOU.
@deejjayell @Yamiche Like what? We find a MM lookalike and hatch a plan to kidnap the real MM and have the fake MM bring the bill to the floor? Seriously: please explain what the people are going to do. I‚Äôm all ears.
@JBePhotography @Yamiche He said he‚Äôs not going to. Why are you hoping for something that‚Äôs not going to happen? Are you living in some sort of alternate universe where MM didn‚Äôt clearly state he will not bring a bill to the floor until it has POTUS/Dem agreement?
@trumpathetic @Yamiche Really going out on a limb there saying a minor budget tiff is lower stakes than 6 million Jews being systematically exterminated. Also, if you think they‚Äôre anywhere in the same galaxy, you might be the dumbest person in a country full of waterheads.
@mz @Yamiche Hey, great idea. One problem: HE SAID HE‚ÄôS NOT GOING TO DO IT. So there‚Äôs that.
@Gwar56 @Yamiche Attention dumbass: we already have 700 miles of wall/fence/etc on the border. It‚Äôs already there.
@Shirleen9162 @Yamiche Not happening. No bill can come to the floor unless MM lets it.
@ECGreaves @Yamiche MM has zero constitutional duty to bring a bill to the floor.
@DontaHenson @Yamiche You‚Äôre saying there‚Äôs no heat now? I hope the cave you‚Äôre living in is comfortable.
@Cuisinart1965 @Yamiche In the meantime our country crumbles. Great idea, sir,
@dargon_f @Yamiche @POTUS Good luck with that, dullard.
@ReaderAdrift @Yamiche Neither‚Äòs going to happen. Thanks for contributing nothing.
@sponson @Yamiche Yep. The only way out of this is for all federal workers to walk out of their jobs and not come back until a deal is done. That‚Äôs how broken our government is.
@RasJosh10 @Yamiche Ding ding. This is the only way out. All of you partisan dumbshits, I hope you‚Äôre proud when it takes a national emergency to get the f**king government opened.
@popcorn_jane @Yamiche Neither‚Äòs going to happen. Stop living in your fantasy world.
@diyall @Yamiche He‚Äôs not going to, you idiot. Source: THAT‚ÄôS WHAT HE F**KING SAID. Are we a nation of 5 year olds?
@Yamiche It‚Äôs plain to see. It‚Äôll end when @TSA employees walk out, no one can fly, and our airports are in utter chaos. Yes, the state of our ‚Äúgovernment‚Äù is so poor that only a disaster can make any headway.
@oldwomanandadog @SenSanders Not going to happen. The only way anything happens is when TSA walks off the job and our airports are plunged into chaos.
@Darcy28foryou @jackiej75637880 @SenSanders Then you‚Äôre a problem. The rest of us have lives to live and don‚Äôt want to see 5 hour TSA lines. Stop holding us hostage to your non-negotiable stand.
@SenSanders I‚Äôm sure after he held out a tiny olive branch and was shouted down that‚Äôs going to happen. You‚Äôre a failure, just like the POTUS. Shame on you.
@CNNPolitics Folks, it‚Äôs over. This shutdown is going to last until TSA walks off the job and our airports are plunged into chaos. A dark time in this country‚Äôs history. Both parties should be ashamed of themselves. Unfortunately, they‚Äôre both preening like cocks of the walk.
@KenTremendous You‚Äôre such a genius. It makes me unbelievably sad that you‚Äôre using that genius to further divide an already terribly fractured country.
@SenGillibrand Except hating men.
@SenGillibrand You‚Äôre not going to become POTUS by demonizing men.
@Political_Matt @AP Wrap your mind around this: the founders didn‚Äôt even envision a standing military. They assumed we‚Äôd form an army to fight a war and then disband it. The notion of a standing - and very very large - army is a fairly modern notion.
@_Latitudinarian @smittyd060 @brianschatz @realDonaldTrump @SpeakerPelosi Trump‚Äôs wall will not do a god damn thing to change legal immigration. Even the left admits this. Why, then, is @SpeakerPelosi allowed to bloviate on and on about how it‚Äôs some sort of death blow to immigration? Because neither side can be honest about itself.
@_Latitudinarian @smittyd060 @brianschatz @realDonaldTrump By your logic, @SpeakerPelosi is a terrorist, because she‚Äôs promoting the notion that if we have a wall, we‚Äôre inveterate racists. We already have 700 miles of physical barrier. This notion we‚Äôre crossing a Rubicon is first-class hogwash.
@_Latitudinarian @smittyd060 @brianschatz @realDonaldTrump It‚Äôs laughable on its face to call him a terrorist. Feel free to dislike him. Please don‚Äôt hijack the English language in service of your cause. The level of discourse is forever altered when you bend words beyond their meaning.
@metheridge @Chiefs @HyVee @ArrowheadPride @dpshow @richeisen @PSchrags @pgsween She‚Äôs not the only one.
@_Latitudinarian @brianschatz @TheDemocrats Yes, they are - and reasons to want the shutdown over ASAP. Hence why ‚Äúwe don‚Äôt negotiate with kidnappers/terrorists‚Äù makes no sense. The only people hurt are fed employees and those who depend on them - in particular every single person who flies on a plane.
@smittyd060 @brianschatz It‚Äôs good to know hyperbole is alive and well.
@_Latitudinarian @brianschatz You don‚Äôt understand the metaphor. If Trump‚Äôs the kidnapper, we‚Äôre who was kidnapped and the ones who will be shot in the head and dumped in a heavily wooded area if @TheDemocrats don‚Äôt negotiate. I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs what you want.
@dealyjustin @brianschatz He‚Äôs smarter than you, friendo.
@brianschatz This makes sense, but @SpeakerPelosi is going to have to back down from her ‚Äúno wall‚Äù position to make it happen.
@AndrewBrandt What if they keep him and he doesn‚Äôt report? I‚Äôd love to know the impact of that. Given the schism, if they can‚Äôt trade him, I think that‚Äôs a realistic possibility.
@TL_LARams @RamsNFL When I look at this I see Layoffs.
@CBSNews Can we get a @kickstarter going to pay TSA employees?
@WSJ That sounds in no way easy to prepare.
@MikeCarolla @NateSilver538 Let me revise my statement: you‚Äôre living in an alternate reality and/or brain dead. Me, I‚Äôd have taken the wakka-wakka path, but to each his own.
@kevin8seven @NateSilver538 Feel free to give in to cynicism. I‚Äôll keep fighting for my country until I‚Äôm in the grave.
@BigGrin94 @NateSilver538 And negotiate down from there. This isn‚Äôt a new thing. This is how negotiations have worked since one Neanderthal bargained with another.
@daveexmachina @NateSilver538 So your hot take is that we do nothing for two years? Good stuff. Ever considered running for office?

@Hawgellujah @NateSilver538 If Dems and POTUS agree, MM will bring the bill to the floor in a heartbeat.
@kevin8seven @NateSilver538 If ‚Äúlooking like you caved‚Äù is more important than what was actually accomplished, this country is fucked.

@ABC Clearly they're very skilled at digging. Let's leverage that talent.
@ABC Here's a crazy idea. We take these folks, we give them pipes without lead, we use them to dig out all of the lead pipes in our drinking water infrastructure and replace them with unleaded ones. #NewGreenDeal

@SenatorLeahy @SenSanders @PeterWelch Solid bill. Not many Americans want to work these jobs that are typically low-paying and back-breaking.
@Im_TheAntiTrump While I'll agree there's a realistic chance @POTUS goes down, there's zero chance @VP goes down. You might dislike him, but he's a veteran politician. He's not going to commit rookie mistakes like @POTUS. But enjoy your hashtag!

@tedlieu @realDonaldTrump @POTUS Late night Ted. Good stuff, brother.
@8MindBodySoul @ThePlumLineGS @brianschatz Brother, if dozens of Senators telling him the same thing isn‚Äôt working, I don‚Äôt think I have much of a chance.
@CNNSitRoom @CNNPolitics @wolfblitzer Good lord. What a non-answer. ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs all just pray MM changes his mind‚Äù. Awesome.
@ThePlumLineGS @brianschatz So what‚Äôs your suggestion for stopping the shutdown? Thoughts &amp; prayers?
@MarkWarner @wmata @faizsays Sen. Warner, I‚Äôm a constituent. Would love to hear something being done other than praying for MM to bring the House bill to the floor. Maybe you can be the leader POTUS can‚Äôt. üôè
@SenSchumer @realDonaldTrump How about we end the shutdown first? Seems kinda important.
@JudyWoodruff @NewsHour @Cirincione @nickschifrin I‚Äôm drinking a @naturallight right now. @Cirincione I can hook you up brother.
@PostSports @ProfBlackistone SJWing it up. Awesome.

@timkaine Day 97: Mobs have gained control of our airports. Huddled around burning 55 gallon drums with fingerless gloves, they feast on cheese trays and miniature bags of pretzels, using seat covers and blankets as fuel to keep warm.
@SenBobCasey How about the shutdown? Anything to report on that?
@SenatorDurbin @NPR Let me guess: you don't like it.
@CBSNews @SabrinaSiddiqui Thanks for the good news!
@RoyBlunt I think the entire country could use a fleet of comfort dogs right now.
@wingoz Try the veal and remember to tip your waiters and waitresses. Next stop, The Yak-Yak Hut in the Adirondacks.
@SenJeffMerkley @AOC @RepKatieHill @senatemajldr Maybe you should ask him what it'll take to bring a bill to end the shutdown to the floor. Oh wait, he already told you and no one - neither the POTUS nor @TheDemocrats - is doing a god damn thing to make it happen. Awesome stuff, y'all.
@CNNPolitics No doubt this will help end the shutdown.
@dcsportsbog What an idiotic thing to say.
@northwo20314164 @LindaTalbot20 @SenAngusKing Yep. Sanders and King can say they're I, but so long as they caucus with Dems, they're functionally Dems.
@kmahoney534 @openingtirade @SweetINXS @lesleyclark @AOC @senatemajldr MM holds all the cards here.
@ABC This is, as the kids say, "throwing shade".
@cordjefferson @DarcyCarden @KenTremendous With a name like Cord, you need a few quirks. Can you imagine how disappointing a milquetoast Cord would be?
@ginabila3 @SenGillibrand @senatemajldr I don't know. I just want the shutdown to be over. I wish we could just put aside our rancor for one day, come to some sort of agreement, and move on. It's startling to see how impossibly difficult that small ask is turning out to be.
@Buckeye4Ever45 @KamalaHarris This x 1000. Every day I wake up hoping for any sign of compromise. Every day I go to bed disappointed I saw none. We need someone to lead us. If the POTUS is abdicating that role, we need a hero from Congress to make it happen, somehow, some way.
@SenatorBaldwin For those reading this: what's your honest, non-schtick answer as to how long this shutdown lasts? For my money, the under/over is set at 60 days. What say you? Higher? Lower?
@FightinHydrant @ac13alex Chick-fil-a has the best service among the four and it's not close. That's what differentiates them.
@DrrDenise @KamalaHarris That's the case for both parties. They're both dug in to their positions. It's like trench warfare in WW1. No one wants to run out of the trench for fear they'll be mowed down by gunfire from their own party. Le sigh.
@ginabila3 @SenGillibrand @senatemajldr When government starts falling apart, neither party's in the right. As they say, a house divided against itself cannot stand. I fear we're seeing the first cracks in the eventual crumbling of the country. Hope I'm wrong.
@LJak07 @SenGillibrand @senatemajldr I hope you'll understand that does absolutely nothing to cheer me up. I'm glad you can view the faint hope MM changes his mind as something to lean on. For me, it's asinine to pin the country's hopes on one man.
@Buckeye4Ever45 @KamalaHarris For the record, I'm not saying she's wrong. It's just unbelievable how predictable everything has become. It's Trump and Anti-Trump with nothing else. It's a sad time to be an American.
@LucyAppa @brianschatz @ChrisMurphyCT Sigh. I'm beyond blaming at this point. I just want even a tiny ray of hope this shutdown will end. I'm not seeing one.
@SenGillibrand @senatemajldr This shutdown is so depressing. I don't care which side you're on. The fact that we're talking about weeks or months before it ends rather than hours or days is an utter failure by both parties. Zero light at the end of the tunnel.
@JuddPalmer4 @KamalaHarris Yes, but that was before she decided to run for the WH in 2020. Though she hasn't announced, I guarantee it will happen. I wouldn't expect any presumptive candidate to agree with Trump on anything. It would be poison in the primary.
@GZer0x @KamalaHarris Particularly when we all know Senator Harris is jockeying for position for the 2020 primary and the sole play in the Dem playbook is who can be the most anti-Trump. Caveat: I voted for her, not him. Lifelong Dem here.
@GZer0x @KamalaHarris It's up to the AG to accept or reject the suggestion. If your litmus test is "must always abide by the recommendation", the proper solution is to make it mandatory rather than suggested. Don't blame Barr for a structural feature of government.

@maziehirono Incredibly sad about the death of bipartisanship in my country. I fear it's gone &amp; never will return.
@KamalaHarris Senator Harris voting against a Trump nominee? I'm astonished.
@WSJ Next week?!?!?!?! Hello, DC - the country is going into the toilet. Maybe we could get a hurry-up on ending the shutdown?
@SenatorDurbin What say we deal with the shutdown first and get to Sec. Nielsen after that?
@KatWolfdancer @brianschatz @ChrisMurphyCT @senatemajldr No, thanks. Candidly, no amount of pressure from peons like you and I is going to change their minds. If they flip, it will be because they decided on their own, not due to phone calls, letters, emails, etc.
@brainboomr22 @ChrisMurphyCT @TheDemocrats @SpeakerPelosi Alrighty. We‚Äôll stay shut down.
@ABC Folls, prep for another week of shutdown at a minimum.
@ChrisMurphyCT @TheDemocrats @SpeakerPelosi I know Dems want $0 for wall, but I think realistically they've got to give him some amount between $1.6B and $5.6B. Split the difference and make it $3.6 for wall + remainder for other border security. Both sides can claim a win.
@ChrisMurphyCT Best solution is for @TheDemocrats to agree to a 3 wk CR for DHS with the understanding they will give POTUS money for border barrier in exchange for re-opening gov't. 3 wk negotiation over how much in total. Prev no from POTUS was based on @SpeakerPelosi giving $0 for wall.
@ChrisMurphyCT POTUS, I've read @ChrisMurphyCT's tweets. POTUS, I've responded to @ChrisMurphyCT's tweets. POTUS..... you're no @ChrisMurphyCT.
@Nick_P_UK @Reuters No worries. As far as I‚Äôm concerned the US &amp; UK are brothers forever. Good luck with the Brexit thing.

@samanthajkent @KamalaHarris It‚Äôs a whole thing. My advice: steer clear of it unless you really love heated argument.
@samanthajkent @KamalaHarris TL;DR Black identifies a specific culture (African diaspora) and white doesn‚Äôt. Not sure that‚Äôs 100% coherent but good enough for me.
@96SC29666 @KamalaHarris And TBH, if the answer was white folks had slaves, you lost your capital letter, I‚Äôd be hard-pressed to quibble. That would seem the least we could do to acknowledge that original sin of our country.
@96SC29666 @KamalaHarris Kinda makes sense that ‚ÄúBlack‚Äù is used to recognize a distinct culture and not a color. Still a little confused why white is lowercase, but I must admit it‚Äôs of no consequence to me.
@reesetheone1 @KamalaHarris Yep. I did some reading and boy is that a topic to avoid.
@beconsaw @KamalaHarris Williams? Probably in the bullpen.
@KamalaHarris Serious question: why do we capitalize the B in Black but not the w in white?
@CNNPolitics How rad would it be if he showed up with a vintage Missile Command arcade game and used it to illustrate his plan?

@zamster201 @kmahoney534 @lesleyclark @AOC @senatemajldr They might have the votes. I don‚Äôt think anyone really knows. It‚Äôs more about not wanting to embarrass a president from your own party by 1) forcing him to veto a bill and 2) potentially overriding that veto.
@SenSchumer @brianschatz @ChrisMurphyCT Sir, thank you for the comic relief. Your constituents appreciate it.
@tearsonurcheek @brianschatz @ChrisMurphyCT You‚Äôre seriously asking me to explain DT? I‚Äôd have a better chance explaining string theory.

@LATimesfarmer @LeviDamien Party lines.
@palisonk @MweneChanga @BMWmermaid @brianschatz @ChrisMurphyCT Let me get this straight: the BEST to hope for is a long shutdown to show people who Trump really is? There are people in gulags with more positive outlooks than you.
@SweetINXS @kmahoney534 @lesleyclark @AOC @senatemajldr Cold comfort for fed workers who can‚Äôt pay bills, people like me who‚Äôll wait hours in TSA lines, and so on. Your attitude is completely irresponsible. 5 year olds play the blame game. Adults get the job done.
@SomewhereinATX @brianschatz @ChrisMurphyCT All I get from this is that bird is rad.
@newestendeavor @kweriousgeorge @commanderdata85 @deadendangel @lesleyclark @seungminkim @AOC @senatemajldr Yep.
@Mason37613833 @KamalaHarris Thank you for making it plainly evident you‚Äôre a moron who ought to be muted. Have a great life!

@FrostySumo @MweneChanga @AnneMurata @BMWmermaid @brianschatz @ChrisMurphyCT @TheDemocrats We‚Äôve been through all of this before. Trust me: if the gov‚Äôt goes that route, we‚Äôre talking years of litigation.
@Mason37613833 @KamalaHarris Nope. It‚Äôll take hours and hours to get on a plane if you can get on at all. National parks will be trashed. People will die. I don‚Äôt think you appreciate just how dangerous this situation is.
@SweetINXS @kmahoney534 @lesleyclark @AOC @senatemajldr Answer one simple question: What if they don‚Äôt?
@palisonk @MweneChanga @BMWmermaid @brianschatz @ChrisMurphyCT Also: in this metaphor, Trump has the gun to the head of the American people and @TheDemocrats are the ones refusing to negotiate. Endgame: we get shot in the head. I‚Äôd call that a ‚Äúbad outcome‚Äù, as they say in the medical field.
@NateSilver538 What if he doesn‚Äôt care about 2020? I submit your analysis should start there.
@KamalaHarris Senator, what if a month from now the shutdown is ongoing? What‚Äôs the backup plan to the current plan of telling shutdown stories and blaming MM/POTUS? We have one, right? It would be terribly irresponsible to pin the country‚Äôs future on two men.
@palisonk @MweneChanga @BMWmermaid @brianschatz @ChrisMurphyCT Hey, if you want to risk endless months of shutdown, that‚Äôs your business. That‚Äôs unacceptable to me. I want solutions, not more name-calling and blame-placing.
@SweetINXS @kmahoney534 @lesleyclark @AOC @senatemajldr If it happens, great! But suppose 30 days from now we‚Äôre still here. What then? A war of attrition where the only people hurt are the American people? Unacceptable. Options are a necessity.
@SweetINXS @kmahoney534 @lesleyclark @AOC @senatemajldr 1) That cannot be guaranteed 2) How much damage will be done tween now &amp; then? 3) could is very different from will
@mns2lv4ever @brianschatz @ChrisMurphyCT As they say: ‚Äúhope for the best but prepare for the worst‚Äù. Dems have the former. I cannot discern any of the latter. The entire party is tethered to praying MM caves with no backup plan.
@mns2lv4ever @brianschatz @ChrisMurphyCT That‚Äôs the problem in a nutshell. As best I can tell, the sole strategy is blame MM and pray. That isn‚Äôt a strategy. That‚Äôs a wish that may or may not come true.
@mns2lv4ever @brianschatz @ChrisMurphyCT I like both of them, but 1) blaming MM is not guaranteed to work and 2) I‚Äôm unaware of anything else they‚Äôre doing to end the shutdown. If MM doesn‚Äôt change his mind, what then? That‚Äôs what I expect Senators to be doing. Any idiot can cross his fingers and hope something happens.
@SweetINXS @kmahoney534 @lesleyclark @AOC @senatemajldr But he‚Äôs publicly said he won‚Äôt. A strategy to cross our fingers and hope he changes his mind is not a strategy. It‚Äôs a Hail Mary.
@tearsonurcheek @brianschatz @ChrisMurphyCT ... which will happen when POTUS and Dems agree. Source: spoken from Mitch‚Äôs mouth into a microphone. Perhaps you heard?
@jetsjets @brianschatz @ChrisMurphyCT @senatemajldr Respectfully, if you didn‚Äôt already know that, you‚Äôre in a cave somewhere. This has been expected for weeks.
@SinglePlayerGam @brianschatz @ChrisMurphyCT ... which comes as no surprise given he‚Äôs publicly stated he will not bring a bill to the floor w/o POTUS/Dem agreement.
@palisonk @MweneChanga @BMWmermaid @brianschatz @ChrisMurphyCT The fact that he has only 2 more years in office and appropriations are annual. No one can ‚Äúshut government down‚Äù. They can only refuse to give more money. Once that money‚Äôs appropriated, POTUS can‚Äôt take it back.
@SenJackReed @SenatorMenendez Lord, give me the strength to make it these next two years.
@bunnydear @MweneChanga @BMWmermaid @brianschatz @ChrisMurphyCT I agree he should. I have no idea whether he will. That's where we part ways. I will not accept that the only solution is waiting to see if he will do what he should do. It just isn't responsible to pin our country's well-being on the minds of two individuals.
@twilightsrose @MweneChanga @BMWmermaid @brianschatz @ChrisMurphyCT I wouldn't accept a promise either. This ought to be like selling something on craigslist. Both sides get everything up front and they walk away with no expectations of anything else. Because one thing I cannot accept is the notion that all we can do is wait for MM to cave.
@NascarHonda @ChrisMurphyCT @brianschatz We'll be fine, you and I. This country made it through the Civil War. Surely we can manage another two years. Keep the faith!
@AryaResists @brianschatz @ChrisMurphyCT Huzzah! I cannot believe whoever started this had the cojones to do it. &lt;slinks into corner and hopes not to be noticed&gt;
@MweneChanga @AnneMurata @BMWmermaid @brianschatz @ChrisMurphyCT @TheDemocrats In reality, the truth is it won't actually happen. Where there's no existing barrier, it's either because there's a natural barrier (mountains, rivers) or gov't has no property rights. That said, I stand by my assertion it will have little impact other than costing money.
@brianschatz From the bottom of my heart, thank you for taking the time to respond to my rude tweet with the professionalism I was unable to muster. I wish you godspeed in ending this shutdown &amp; thanks for acknowledging a peon like myself. It won't go unnoticed.
Attention @Twitter: having a Senator reply to your tweet is a real good way to get a billion notifications. Source: the past 10 minutes. I've seen avalanches that made less impact.
@AnneMurata @MweneChanga @BMWmermaid @brianschatz @ChrisMurphyCT @TheDemocrats There you go! This is what I want from our country. POTUS, you want your wall? Oh, how it's going to cost you. I don't think we need more walls, but if we can give that to get more, sign me up. Dare to dream, says I. We're only limited by our ability to imagine new solutions.
@HopePatel04 @brianschatz @ChrisMurphyCT The sad fact is that I was literally doing the exact same thing - tweeting from work. It was complete nonsense and as previously stated, I have formally labeled said tweet as claptrap. Just trying to stir up a good debate. I'm happy to say it worked.
@AnneMurata @BMWmermaid @brianschatz @ChrisMurphyCT I reject that. I think we can be better than that. In fact, I *know* we can, if we but stop talking and start listening. You believe what you want. As for me, I'll never stop advocating for action over words.
@MHuylerHitomi @brianschatz @ChrisMurphyCT I know you didn't mean it this way, but I picture JLP facepalming because he's sitting in the Enterprise watching this shutdown drag on. See my other tweets - truly, I'm just frustrated. I'm please the Senator acknowledged a peon like myself, even if it was a facepalm.
@MweneChanga @BMWmermaid @brianschatz @ChrisMurphyCT @TheDemocrats As a great man once said: "I might be a dreamer, but I'm not the only one". I cannot accept the only solution is waiting for two men to change their minds. I'll never stop advocating for meaningful action over rhetoric. That's me. You are of course entitled to call me wrong.
@MweneChanga @BMWmermaid @brianschatz @ChrisMurphyCT After all, post-Flint, it's clear we need to invest in drinking water infrastructure. If Dems can get that AND end the shutdown, I believe their constituents would view that as a win. Then @TheDemocrats can run in 2020 as the party of responsibility.
@MweneChanga @BMWmermaid @brianschatz @ChrisMurphyCT What if Dems ask for $20B to start fixing the country's drinking water infrastructure in exchange for $5.6B for the wall? Might that lead to something? Methinks it might. What say you? Would you be OK with that deal?
@NascarHonda @ChrisMurphyCT @brianschatz I am a silly goose on occasion, it's true. I too love the humor, but I also can't help but be frustrated that we're almost a month into a government shutdown with absolutely no endpoint on the horizon. I hope you'll understand if I am a frustrated goose right now. Thanks!
@TonyaWardell @brianschatz @ChrisMurphyCT No offense, but I prefer to spend my time doing more useful things like watching grass grow and paint dry. MM's mind is made up. I'm not foolish enough to think any amount of badgering will change that. If it does? Awesome. Count me as not optimistic on that count.
@NascarHonda @brianschatz @ChrisMurphyCT You're going to need to elaborate.
@Mere_pear @brianschatz @ChrisMurphyCT Fair enough. Two years of government shutdown will be incredibly painful for me. I hope it's better for you.
@nacreousnereid @JulyJane @brianschatz @ChrisMurphyCT I'm sure he's a peach of a Senator, but I will say this: no one wins in this shutdown, and our losses only mount as the days pass. If he can do something to end the shutdown, he'll get my lifetime achievement award without question.
@Muthawalker @brianschatz @ChrisMurphyCT As one James Buffett said: If we weren't all crazy, we would go insane. And thanks to your family for their service. Like you, I love my country. It's just incredibly frustrating to see zero progress on this crucial issue. Godspeed!
@Mickeygw1 @brianschatz @ChrisMurphyCT https://t.co/mWz0roTnmb
@JulyJane @brianschatz @ChrisMurphyCT Truly, it was just good-natured ribbing. No one with a shred of power in government has ever actually responded to me, so you'll understand if my expectation was to throw that Tweet into a black hole of non-response. I greatly admire their engagement with the public.
@Mickeygw1 @brianschatz @ChrisMurphyCT Well said. I'd love for the country to stop attacking itself and start attacking the real bad guys, like Russia and China. Truly, I was just joking about the Twitter bit. Congress could use more humor. I formally withdraw my criticism of the Twitter bit. :-)
@JulieACWalsh @brianschatz @ChrisMurphyCT OK. How does that help end the shutdown? That's what I'm looking for - solutions, not rhetoric. Think whatever you want of MM and POTUS. I'm no fan. I'm also someone who doesn't want to wait for hours to get thru TSA this Saturday.
@dan_barkley @BMWmermaid @brianschatz @ChrisMurphyCT Maybe for the next WHCD we should get these Senators on stage. Not joking. I think that would be entertaining. Work up five minutes of material, you two. If the Congress thing falls through, a background in standup could prove useful. :)
@plinksburgh @brianschatz @ChrisMurphyCT Hey, I'd love to go home and see @MargotRobbie waiting for me in negligee. She isn't. We must all live in reality. Maybe MM will change his mind. I'm not willing to risk that. I'd prefer a proactive approach rather than thoughts &amp; prayers.
@Mickeygw1 @brianschatz @ChrisMurphyCT I voted for her. I'm a lifelong Democrat. I do appreciate that Senators have a funny bone. But I'm also someone who has to take a flight Saturday morning, and two in February, and it very much matters to me that this gets solved. It's a cliche, but this is no laughing matter.
@MaxW8Roc @brianschatz @ChrisMurphyCT Roger that. Thanks for the useful guidance!
@BMWmermaid @brianschatz @ChrisMurphyCT In all seriousness, I was just ribbing. I'm at work tweeting so I can't be the pot calling the kettle black. I'd just love to see the party adopt a proactive approach rather than the endless PR war. Best of luck, Senators. The eyes of the country are on you.
@kort_rob @JemezStargazer @alexg925 @ABC Please refer to my previous tweet regarding two years of shutdown.
@brianschatz @ChrisMurphyCT Like not ending the shutdown? I've been a lifelong Democrat, but sir, please deal with reality. POTUS is a madman. He'll go down with the ship if you don't give him what he wants. Your best option is to give it and get as much back as you can. Thanks!
@steve03201019 @TheDemocrats Well, sir, this is truly breaking news. You're absolutely the first person to notice POTUS is a mercurial egomaniac. First-class stuff. I recommend you explore a career in journalism, what with this incredible insight.
@steve03201019 @TheDemocrats 1) Government's main occupation is wasting $ 2) Everyone knew Mexico would never pay for the wall 3) I'm not an idiot, I know that 4) See #3 Thanks!
@JemezStargazer @kort_rob @alexg925 @ABC That might as well have happened in 1776. It's ancient history. Live in the now.
@brianschatz @ChrisMurphyCT Thanks for doing Twitter bits while the country suffers. Awesome stuff, you two. Really earning your paychecks.
@ChrisMurphyCT @brianschatz Hey, Senator, it sounds like you haven't heard, so here's the breaking news: he's not going to bring any bill to the floor without POTUS/Dem agreement. Sorry every means of communication is broken and you didn't hear that. Cheerio!
@kweriousgeorge @commanderdata85 @deadendangel @lesleyclark @seungminkim @AOC @senatemajldr And then POTUS changed his mind. If that's surprising to you, I hope the cave you've been living in for the past two years was comfortable.
@deadendangel @commanderdata85 @lesleyclark @seungminkim @AOC @senatemajldr It doesn't matter what you call it. That's the way it is. Either deal with reality or stop giving your opinions that have as much relevance as the price of tea in China.
@lesleyclark @AOC @senatemajldr Where he is, is inconsequential. MM's said he will not bring a bill to the floor until it has POTUS/Dem support. I'm no genius, but I'd say that means you ought to support negotiations between POTUS/Dems rather than crossing your fingers and hoping MM changes his mind.
@SInow Antonio Brown is now firmly in "locker room cancer" territory.
@EconProf59 @PattyMurray @SpeakerPelosi This is what the left can't grok. Being right might feel good. It has zero relevance to ending the shutdown. Negotiations are rarely about right and wrong. They're about each side getting enough of what they want to come to an agreement.
@EconProf59 @PattyMurray @SpeakerPelosi I'm on your side in terms of "is the wall a good idea?". My point is this: being right is meaningless. Being right does nothing to change MM's stated intent not to bring anything to the floor w/o POTUS &amp; Dem agreement nor POTUS' intent to veto what he doesn't like.
@EconProf59 @PattyMurray @SpeakerPelosi 1) So what? He's in the Oval Office 2) What the majority of Americans think is inconsequential 3) Calling for a debate when you have no intention of giving the other side something they want is not a debate
@MarshalColorado @SueSpagnolo @ABC @TheDemocrats Any person with two brain cells knows Mexico was never going to pay for the wall. Apparently you're in the zero or one brain cell category. My condolences.
@Jonpatriot @Imyafatha @ABC @GOP @TheDemocrats Whatever it is, whatever the dollar amount is, the point is that instead of the nonsense "no wall" position, get something in exchange.
@steve03201019 @TheDemocrats Hah. I voted for her, by the way. Difference between you and me? I can get past emotion. You can't. Because if you could, you'd understand the wall just isn't meaningful, not when we already have 700 miles of fencing/wall/slats on the southern border.
@cnni &lt;long thread of partisan idiots repeating talking points&gt;
@acnewsitics @scrabbleal @Yamiche He's already publicly said he's not going to bring anything to the floor until POTUS and Dems agree. Not sure there's anything more on the record than that.
@scrabbleal @Yamiche Nope.
@Yamiche Well, now that they've delivered a letter, I'm sure MM will change his mind. Impactful stuff, y'all. Thanks for earning your paychecks rather than continuing to hammer on the same tired message and praying it works.
@PattyMurray Senator, that's laughable. @SpeakerPelosi already said POTUS will not get what he wants. In effect, she's foreclosed the possibility of any meaningful debate. Why on earth would POTUS reopen government when Dems have zero interest in negotiating?
@SenatorHassan Thoughts &amp; prayers don't work when we have a mass shooting. They're sure not going to work here. DO SOMETHING rather than crossing your fingers and praying the other side does something. Fortune favors the bold, Senator.
@SenateDems @ChrisVanHollen @EPA Let me take a wild guess: because he wants his wall.
@SenAngusKing Senator, maybe you can pull your magic wand out of that desk you're sitting on and make it happen, because repeating your party's talking points ain't gonna do it.
@steve03201019 @TheDemocrats Thanks for contributing absolutely nothing to the discussion, you rube. Climb back on your turnip truck and get out of this conversation. Logic doesn't suit you.
@SueSpagnolo @ABC @TheDemocrats Unfortunately neither side cares about compromise. They're diametrically opposed and unwilling to do anything other than repeat talking points. While Rome burns, they're all just fiddling away. It's a national embarrassment on both sides.
@SueSpagnolo @ABC Here's your answer: @TheDemocrats should give POTUS his $5.6B for the wall, but in return demand $5.6B for something they want - green energy, social justice, infrastructure, etc. I guarantee you that will work, if only the Dems can get over their "no wall, not ever" position.
@Imyafatha @ABC @GOP @TheDemocrats That's exactly what Dems should do. POTUS, you want $5.6B for your wall? OK, but you're going to give us something big. Maybe it's billions for green energy. Maybe it's billions to fix our drinking water infrastructure. Find something you want and ask for a whole lot of money.
@kort_rob @alexg925 @ABC Then get ready for two years of shutdown. No flying. National parks in shambles. All to stop a wall that ALREADY EXISTS. 700 miles of walls/fencing slats already exist on our southern border. Awesome. You're a fine citizen, sir. Bravo!
@WSJ What a collection of assholes.
@timkaine I'm a constituent, Senator, and no we can't. Only Mitch McConnell and/or POTUS can do that. Just FYI.
@DonnaFEdwards @ewarren @SenGillibrand As a white man who‚Äôs no longer welcome in the party, good luck. Bye!
@MoveTheSticks I love your #CDVTW crock pot.
@MatthewJohn666 Buffoonish, you fucking moron.
@CNNPolitics Strategy for both sides: blame the other party and pray they back down. What a fucking debacle.
@JeffHJR87 @PattyMurray @SeaTacAirport It‚Äôs really not. The government is teetering on disaster.
@KamalaHarris Boy, that is some breaking news. Government shutdowns do damage? First I‚Äôm hearing about it. Awesome stuff, Senator.
@JeffHJR87 @PattyMurray @SeaTacAirport You know the answer. Half of the country hates POTUS with a burning passion and is completely unable to deal with the fact he‚Äôs in the White House. I didn‚Äôt vote for him, but I‚Äôm completely embarrassed so many Americans cannot get over that fact and deal with reality.
@PattyMurray @SeaTacAirport God forbid you actually do something to end the shutdown, Senator. Clearly it‚Äôs much wiser to collect stories of misery. Awesome stuff.
@methodskeptic @PamelaRozaHayes @PattyMurray @SpeakerPelosi Or, the 700 miles of walls/fencing/etc ALREADY ON THE GOD DAMN SOUTHERN BORDER OF OUR COUNTRY. Christ. The average American is brain dead. Both sides of the aisle.
@SenatorDurbin Thanks for providing that crucial insight. Really earning that paycheck by stating facts we‚Äôve known for weeks. Tip o‚Äô the cap, Senator. Great stuff.
@PamelaRozaHayes @PattyMurray @SpeakerPelosi That question is irrelevant. He is who he is. He is where he is. He wants what he wants. You can either deal with that reality or not, but if it‚Äôs the latter, your opinion is of no consequence. You can‚Äôt wish him away.
@MatthewJohn666 It‚Äôs called a joke, dumbass.
@PattyMurray @SpeakerPelosi told POTUS he‚Äôd never get his wall. Why would he reopen government when the other side is unwilling to negotiate? If he does, we‚Äôll be in the exact same position three weeks from now.
@jana7197 @SenSanders Isn't it my money? I earned it. Why should the government take more because it's determined how much I need and how much is excess? It's not the government's money. Why does government get to reach into my pockets and say I'm going to take what I think you don't need?
@jana7197 @SenSanders I get it. But what if I want to buy a mansion in Malibu? They cost tens of millions of dollars. Is it really the government's role to say, hey, citizen, you've got too much money, no Malibu mansion, we're going to take that "extra money" and give it to other people?
@listenbrother @jana7197 @SenSanders @AOC And to me, @TheDemocrats are moving away from that. The party's attitude seems to be "you're entitled to everything" rather than "it's your responsibility to achieve a good life". I wish the party were more centrist, a blend of those two ideas.
@listenbrother @jana7197 @SenSanders @AOC I'm exaggerating, clearly. I understand some people are born on third and didn't hit a triple to get there. I just dislike the left's idea that it's never your fault - that if you don't have the life you want, it's society's fault. I like personal responsibility.
@listenbrother @jana7197 @SenSanders Fair enough, but @AOC is suggesting a top tax rate of 70%, which is not "a little more". That's a lot more. Also, if you have $5, maybe that's on you and not me? I figured out how to have $100. Isn't it reasonable to say, hey, why don't you figure it out for yourself?
@listenbrother @jana7197 @SenSanders But this constant and unceasing attack on people who have more because they're successful? To me, that's contrary to everything this country stands for, which is that your standard of living is commensurate with your achievement.
@listenbrother @jana7197 @SenSanders What if I want an original Picasso? Or a rare Ferrari? If I started a business and made hundreds of millions, why is it wrong for me to reap the rewards of my success? I detest the left's war on success. I'll grant you that if you earn more, you should pay more. No question.
@listenbrother @jana7197 @SenSanders And that's what annoys me about the left in 2019 - this notion that having "too much money" is immoral. Who are we to say you're not allowed to buy a $50M mansion in Malibu? Because I'd love to be rich enough to do that.
@listenbrother @jana7197 @SenSanders Fair enough. It's a defensible position. Me, I think if I had millions, I'd like to keep them. I'd like to buy a yacht. I'd like multiple houses. I'd like a penthouse in Manhattan. I wouldn't like the government saying "you have enough, so we're taking the rest".
@jana7197 @SenSanders Safety net? Sure. But I've got no problem with people who earn more having more. That's what keeps us moving in the right direction - that those who contribute to the country are rewarded.
@jana7197 @SenSanders And that's where I have concern with @SenSanders' positions. I think they tread into the territory of rewarding behavior that's not good for the country. I love the idea that here, you get what you earn, and I'll never stop loving that idea.
@jana7197 @SenSanders But if we're talking about giving everyone everything - no. You've worked hard all your life and contributed to the nation. Should a no-count person who's done nothing get the same as you? Me, I say no. I say if you want the good life, work hard toward it, just like you did.
@jana7197 @SenSanders But suppose you're not you. You're someone who doesn't work, who doesn't contribute, who doesn't improve the country. I'm for a hand up - mental health care, care for children, an overall safety net. That's a good investment.
@jana7197 @SenSanders All a matter of policy. Were it up to me, I'd say you absolutely deserve health and happiness. My main concern is that we reward good behavior. You're contributing to the country in a fantastic way. You ought to be rewarded with a good life.
@jana7197 @SenSanders 70% is right about the point where if you go any higher, the ultra-rich will stop trying to earn more since it doesn't gain them anything. This is the great debate of our time - should gov't take as much as it can or as little as it needs?
@jana7197 @SenSanders It's also a question of the purpose of taxes. Should you pay for what you get? If so, the rich should pay far less. OTOH, if you think fair is taxing the rich to provide for everyone's well-being, max taxes rates should be a lot higher (in the 70% range).
@jana7197 @SenSanders Plenty of countries tax the wealthy at far higher rates. It's not crazy to say maybe that's what we should do. But this notion that the rich are getting away with something is simply not true. They already pay a ton. ? is really whether you prefer private or public solutions.
@jana7197 @SenSanders It's a great article. We can argue about what's "fair", but one thing we can't argue about is where the money is coming from - people earning in the hundreds of thousands of dollars. Maybe they should be paying more, maybe less. That's a matter of policy we can discuss.
@jana7197 @SenSanders Cite, not site. --&gt; https://t.co/mCBXOHFHRf - Pew Research Center is fairly nonpartisan.
@listenbrother @jana7197 @SenSanders Yes, it is. Higher earners are taxed at a higher (not lower) rate, and we have a ~$4 trillion budget. Amount very much matters. We have to raise enough money to fund that budget. But hey, keep going on with your anti-rich diatribe. It's very in vogue these days.
@listenbrother @jana7197 @SenSanders I'm fortunate to be among the people who earn more than $100k. I live in a shitty townhouse and drive a car that's 10 years old with a broken taillight. True, I take some nice vacations, but if I were earning $100k elsewhere, I'd have a mansion and a fancy car.
@listenbrother @jana7197 @SenSanders Hey, man, I live in Northern Virginia. $250k is nowhere close to upper class here. That's middle class. Houses here cost $600k. I realize to some people $250k seems like fabulous wealth, but in many parts of the country it's nowhere close to that.
@StandUpResist @centerrightbot @TheDemocrats Fair enough. Me, I'd rather have a proactive solution rather than crossing my fingers and hoping MM changes his mind, but you go ahead and cross your fingers. Methinks that's not going to work out well for you, but godspeed.
@AP It's comforting to know the US isn't alone in being in complete and utter turmoil. Thanks, UK!
@NateSilver538 Think the carving station at Sizzler.
@jana7197 @SenSanders You get to drive on roads paid for by other people. You get to receive healthcare paid for by other people. You live securely in this country due to a military paid for by other people. That's reality. And if you like that, God bless. It's your mind; you get to decide.
@jana7197 @SenSanders Now, maybe you like that idea. That's fine. But let's be honest. The federal government is basically a giant wealth redistribution system. If you earn less than $100k, you're not paying for much, yet you get the same as everyone else.
@jana7197 @SenSanders You probably aren't paying it, sorry. Those making more than $100k (16.8% of people) pay 80.6% of the taxes (source: Pew Research Center). The other 83.2% of people pay 19.5% of the taxes. Effectively 17% of the country is funding just about everything. That's a fact.
@MatthewJohn666 Tell that to the Supreme Court. I believe they disagree, and no offense, I'm going to go ahead and believe them, what with the "Supreme" in the name and all. Unless your last name is Supreme, in which case we might have a standoff as to a winner.
@StandUpResist @centerrightbot @TheDemocrats Perhaps it's our time to crumble. I really think that's what the people want. Don't you? They'd be completely OK with the United States crumbling so long as their side doesn't give an inch to the other side. Awesome stuff. You're traitors, all of you. Both sides.
@StandUpResist @centerrightbot @TheDemocrats But hey, maybe being completely unable to fly due to no TSA agents is what the people want. Maybe they want the national parks to fall into shambles. Maybe they'd all rather destroy this country over a wall (or lack thereof). Every dynasty has to end sometime.
@StandUpResist @centerrightbot @TheDemocrats I mean, that's my goal - to end the shutdown. Apparently no one else in the United States wants that, since all they're doing is blaming someone else for the shutdown while offering zero realistic plans to actually do anything.
@StandUpResist @centerrightbot @TheDemocrats Alrighty, so that leaves us where exactly? We're just going to keep government shut down for 2 years to "send a message to Trump"? Tell me how we end the shutdown given what you said. Hopes &amp; prayers? Magic wands? Alternate reality?
@jana7197 @SenSanders I mean, feel free to like the ideas, but almost all of them have one thing in common: taking a ton of money from some folks and giving it to others, either directly or in the form of services/subsidies. Hey, maybe Robin Hood was right. But we ought to be honest about it.
@jana7197 @SenSanders Tuition-free is free. $15 minimum wage is free money (diff between market wage and min wage). The ACA is free money (heavily subsidized), so clearly Medicare for all is more free $. But please, enlighten me as to how these things aren't free/handouts.
@NateSilver538 I can't tell you how happy it makes me when you give a hot take on food.
@RonWyden Hey, thanks for doing absolutely nothing to help end the shutdown. Really earning your paycheck, fella.
@StandUpResist @centerrightbot @TheDemocrats All of your sound and fury signifies nothing. Blaming gets us nowhere. In a microcosm, this is the reason for the shutdown. Both parties would rather blame each other than do anything that might actually result in a consensus agreement.
@SenSanders Why is this surprising? People love free stuff.
@TheDemocrats Hard to see how Dems refusing to meet with POTUS at the White House gets us there....
@Gillette Here's some toxic masculinity for you: F**K YOU!
@CNNPolitics Good to see progress is being made. Way to go! I can almost feel the shutdown ending. Give it a few months. I'm sure the country won't turn into a disaster in that time.
@cnni Some would say living in Honduras is in itself living in prison, what with all of the violence and criminality.
@chadweld56 @PattyMurray @SeaTacAirport You're absolutely right, which is sad, because they just can't live in reality. Nature is red in tooth and claw. I'd love to see vegans go protest the grizzly bears that are violently eating all sorts of other animals. At least that would be philosophically consistent.
@NSchneiderAZ13 @PattyMurray @SeaTacAirport An ineffectual action is equivalent to non-action in terms of results. Again - what is the Senator doing that has any chance of actually ending the shutdown? Because blaming the other side isn't going to do a god damn thing to achieve a result.
@SenDuckworth Call me when it gets to the SCOTUS. Until then, there's zero resolution.
@PattyMurray @SeaTacAirport Sen. Murray, please give me the specific actions you're taking to end the shutdown, because I don't see any. I see another anti-Trump polemic that's accomplishing nothing aside from feeding red meat to your base.
@SenJackReed Keep on playing the blame game while workers continue to go without pay. Maybe you can find Nero's fiddle and play it on the Senate floor. Awesome stuff.
@JennyVrentas @RobertKlemko White folks like those families are racists and are holding black folks down. Be honest with your readers. White folks who are producing QBs are inveterate racists who are Jim Crowing it up to keep black folks down. That's your position, and to not go full-on with it is sad.
@JennyVrentas @RobertKlemko Don't disguise your attack with a thin covering of "but this isn't really an attack". Come out and say these white families are part of the problem you've identified. They're small cogs in the machine that holds black folks back. That's your position, isn't it?
@JennyVrentas This isn't an article. It's a polemic, and a dishonest one at that. @RobertKlemko wants to both say there's nothing wrong with these families and simultaneously say white folks (which includes those families) are to blame. Be coherent. If you want to attack white folks, do it.
@PostSports ‚ÄúThe Internet‚Äù is a remarkable collection of assholes.
@FiveThirtyEight There aren‚Äôt many Dem candidates I‚Äôd be happy to vote for. @amyklobuchar is one of them.
@BernieSanders You‚Äôre a dumbass if you think a $15 min wage nationally is a good idea.
@CNNPolitics I read the article and all I got from it is that Ms. Rao seems very intelligent and has incredible insight.
@StartRunning2 @SenatorHassan @HouseGOP @SenateGOP I‚Äôm going to get carpal tunnel syndrome if I keep typing. Thanks for the discussion.
@APWestRegion Men, stay away from women. They aren‚Äôt worth it.
@StartRunning2 @SenatorHassan I think they might be. I wish it weren‚Äôt so, but I don‚Äôt see POTUS caving. Does MM cave? Not optimistic. I don‚Äôt think the GOP base wants him to. This is a game of chicken and I just don‚Äôt see how Dems win it.
@StartRunning2 @SenatorHassan I don‚Äôt see a need for $5B for a wall, but personally, I‚Äôd take the first option. Government wastes our money all the time. Cost of doing business. Worth it to make sure workers get paid &amp; avoid calamity. Perhaps you think differently.
@StartRunning2 @SenatorHassan What if the only way to avoid a yearlong shutdown was to fund $5B for a wall? That‚Äôs the real question. Which would you choose - open gov‚Äôt now with $5B for the wall or no wall $ and gov‚Äôt closed for a year? Those might be our only choices.
@CloverAddict @PattyMurray Hey, think whatever you want, but you‚Äôre wrong. To not waver means to be resolute in your position. Waiver makes no sense. Have a great life!
RT @BarstoolSC: Who‚Äôs the real USC? An experiment:		RT for University of South Carolina		Like for University of Southern California
@bbrooks_79 Don‚Äôt listen to anyone who says Red Dead Redemption 2. You want the new Spider-Man game on PS4. Trust me.
@cnnbrk Augustus Gloop reference.
@StartRunning2 @SenatorHassan What the f**k does that have to do with what I said? Assume the wall serves no purpose. Is it worth $5.6B to end the shutdown? That‚Äôs the point, not whether or not the wall is needed.
@SenatorCollins Compromise? What‚Äôs that?
@SenatorHassan Maybe this is a stupid question, but if it takes $5.6B for the wall to end the shutdown and get workers paid, shouldn‚Äôt we do that?
@Patriot205 @legdugs @PattyMurray @senatemajldr Alrighty. I‚Äôd rather do something proactive rather than crossing my fingers and hoping, but each to his/her own.
@Patriot205 @PattyMurray So according to you, if MM doesn‚Äôt ‚Äúdo his job‚Äù, Dems should accept 2 years of shutdown? Those are the 2 options? Just to be clear.
@LyleRugby @laurenlavoie @PattyMurray I voted for her. Difference between us? I can see past emotion and think rationally. Clearly you can‚Äôt, nor can most Dems. They‚Äôd rather live in a fantasy world rather than in reality. Also, thanks for fat shaming. Real coherent argument. Good luck - you clearly need it.
@legdugs @Patriot205 @PattyMurray @senatemajldr But he‚Äôs already said he‚Äôs not going to do that. What makes you think he‚Äôll change his mind?
@Patriot205 @PattyMurray He‚Äôs already decided. Keep blaming him all you want. That won‚Äôt do a single thing to end the shutdown.
@LyleRugby @laurenlavoie @PattyMurray Great. So 6 months of shutdown? Christ. Incredible damage will be done. Is your hatred for Trump worth that? Is ‚Äúsending a message‚Äù worth majorly breaking the country? I say no. Clearly you disagree.
@LyleRugby @Grey_Obelisk @PattyMurray But he‚Äôs not going to. What then? Stand firm on no wall and have an endless shutdown? Tell me what your answer is if MM doesn‚Äôt bring it to the floor.
@Patriot205 @PattyMurray He‚Äôs already said he won‚Äôt bring it for a vote w/o POTUS approval. What‚Äôs your solution? Pray he changes his mind?
@LyleRugby @laurenlavoie @PattyMurray Then get ready for 2 years of shutdown. Very responsible.
@KamalaHarris Maybe people shouldn‚Äôt take out those loans without a realistic plan to pay them off. Oh, I forgot - the nanny state has to take care of everyone.
@FiveThirtyEight His path looks like the Pass of Caradras. Virtually impassable.
@RadRealityShow @PhoenixWomanMN @SpeakerPelosi @HouseDemocrats @SenateGOP @senatemajldr @POTUS Thanks for contributing nothing to the discussion.
@Grey_Obelisk @PattyMurray That‚Äôs right, which is why Dems need to get to the table and ask for something in return.
@laurenlavoie @PattyMurray They also want to end the shutdown, which requires a wall. Which do you choose? Wall or endless shutdown?
@CloverAddict @PattyMurray Then prepare for months and months of shutdown. Glad you care about fed workers. Also, it‚Äôs waver, you dullard.
@PattyMurray I‚Äôd love to know what you‚Äôre doing other than praying for a miracle to end the shutdown. MM said no bill until POTUS/Dems agree. POTUS said no end to shutdown without wall. How does blaming Trump solve anything?
@PhoenixWomanMN @SpeakerPelosi @HouseDemocrats @SenateGOP @senatemajldr And then MM said no bill would be brought up until POTUS and Dems agreed. RE: 2006 - good lord, why would that be relevant? The here and now is vastly different. Dems seem to think being right is enough. It‚Äôs not, not by a long shot.
@Cmdr_Thisk @SpeakerPelosi @HouseDemocrats @SenateGOP @senatemajldr Are you high? What in God‚Äôs name makes you think MM‚Äôs going to reverse course? It‚Äôs not going to happen.
@LyleRugby @PattyMurray For what? Nothing in her tweet helps end the shutdown. Unless you‚Äôre thanking her for helping to prolong the shutdown.
@PattyMurray Senator, perhaps you remember weeks ago MM said he wouldn‚Äôt bring anything to the floor until POTUS and Dems came to an agreement? You‚Äôre wasting time. Go make a deal with the POTUS if you want to end the shutdown.
@SpeakerPelosi @HouseDemocrats @SenateGOP @senatemajldr This shouldn‚Äôt come as a surprise. MM said weeks ago he wouldn‚Äôt bring anything to the floor until POTUS and Dems agreed. Why are you acting as if this was unexpected? You knew the deal. Now go make one.
@PBConFOX @SweetHandsPlant @premierboxing Great fight! ü•ä
@SenGillibrand @realDonaldTrump Maybe tell us how you propose to end the shutdown? ...

@amyklobuchar This is adorable.
@theGoatKnows @pedrogomezESPN @BleacherReport @MikeLeslieWFAA You mean once they agree, there‚Äôs no ‚Äúdo-over‚Äù?
@OnSiteCremation @KamalaHarris Please acknowledge you‚Äôre wrong.
@OnSiteCremation @KamalaHarris black¬∑mail	/ÀàblakÀåmƒÅl/Submit	noun	1.	the action, treated as a criminal offense, of demanding payment or another benefit from someone in return for not revealing compromising or damaging information about them.
@SenGillibrand Then why don‚Äôt you ask him for $20B for all of those things in exchange for $5B for his wall?
@wingoz Easy to say ‚Äúit shouldn‚Äôt be about $‚Äù when it‚Äôs not your $.
@OnSiteCremation @KamalaHarris You don‚Äôt understand negotiation.
@OnSiteCremation @KamalaHarris I stand by what I said. The wall is personal for him. Like it or not, that is an accurate characterization. What I think about it is of no consequence.
@pedrogomezESPN @BleacherReport @MikeLeslieWFAA Pedro, correct me if I‚Äôm wrong, but can‚Äôt teams go over with stiff penalties? Or is it really a hard cap?
@FairfaxCountyPD Crews are doing a great job - thanks!
@realDonaldTrump Sir, an idea. Tomorrow, tweet that you‚Äôre offering $20B in water infrastructure improvements (pipes, etc) in exchange for $5.6B for steel border slats. That is a huge win for Dems. They‚Äôd be crazy to say no. That‚Äôs how you get to a win.
@KamalaHarris Senator - how about in exchange for giving Trump his wall, Dems get $20B to fix the nation‚Äôs water infrastructure? Seems like a win.
@Friendlygiant20 @mojorisin231 @WingRealist @SenSchumer @realDonaldTrump Now, you‚Äôre right- Trump could have started the negotiations. But he didn‚Äôt. That puts the ball squarely in the Dems‚Äô court.  They should come in with a ridiculously high ask and negotiate down from there.
@Friendlygiant20 @mojorisin231 @WingRealist @SenSchumer @realDonaldTrump After Pelosi said you‚Äôll never get your wall. Walking away from the table is a classic negotiating tactic. That‚Äôs a signal that hey, I want this badly, which any sensible negotiator views as a way to extract max value from the other side.
@Friendlygiant20 @SenSchumer @realDonaldTrump You don‚Äôt understand how negotiating works. Pelosi should have said ‚Äúhey, wait a minute. What if we give you your wall? Will you give us $20B to fix the country‚Äôs water infrastructure?‚Äù. When one side demands something, you don‚Äôt say no. You ask for what you want.
@Mason_Foster That‚Äôs a quality headboard.
@SpeakerPelosi An idea: give @realDonaldTrump his wall in exchange for $20B to fix our water infrastructure. Would be a win for both sides. What say you? #TrumpShutdown
@WhitfordBradley The good news is, if WW ever comes back, y‚Äôall are gonna have a gold mine of material.
@NoraPrinciotti You and Melissa Etheridge.
@JABergman @greggrosenthal Gay? Me too.
A question for @TheDemocrats - what would you take in exchange for giving POTUS $5.6B for his wall? DACA protection? $6B for giving teachers a one time bonus? $10B for helping the uninsured? $20B for improving drinking water infrastructure? #TrumpShutdown looking for ideas.
@mojorisin231 @Friendlygiant20 @WingRealist @SenSchumer @realDonaldTrump Dems should realize this is a golden opportunity. Trump desperately wants his wall. They‚Äôre in great position to get something big in return, if they can only move off of their nonsense ‚Äúno wall‚Äù stance.
@Friendlygiant20 @SenSchumer @realDonaldTrump You‚Äôre telling me that if Dems said Ok, here‚Äôs $5B for your wall, but we want $5B for something we want, he wouldn‚Äôt be interested?
@beebigelow @amyklobuchar Or make it $10B for something Dems what. The point is, the way to ending the shutdown is for both sides to get something they want.
@beebigelow @amyklobuchar A real solution: hey, Trump, we‚Äôll give you $5.7B for your wall but we want $5.7B for something we want. Win-win. Unless you‚Äôre more interested in posturing than getting shit done.
@beebigelow @amyklobuchar Again - why? Until both sides negotiate, nothing‚Äôs going to happen. I don‚Äôt want her to waste her time. She ought to enjoy the snow day rather than wasting her time.
@ABC I officially dub it ‚ÄúThe Super Bowl Halftime Shitshow‚Äù.
@amyklobuchar Ames, love ya, but you know that‚Äôs pointless. Mitch M won‚Äôt bring them to a vote. You‚Äôd be better off enjoying the snow than wasting your time on pointless kabuki.
@fuggin_cyclist @geoffschwartz NFL minimum is about $400k, right? Times 3-4 years, that‚Äôs not enough to cover them the rest of their lives, esp. if they have serious medical issues.
@geoffschwartz And they have to be financially prepared. The main reason NFLPA hasn‚Äôt been able to make a stand is that players aren‚Äôt prepared years out to miss paychecks.
@TommyBeer @CraigHoffman @bball_ref The Wiz should be tanking. They‚Äôre going nowhere this year.
@TheDemocrats The economy‚Äôs going fairly well, if that counts for anything.
@WSJ And then what? There‚Äôs zero sign the sides can reach a deal. I don‚Äôt know what kicking the can down the road 3 weeks accomplishes in the big picture.
@AP_Politics I don‚Äôt understand why people think Trump‚Äôs going to cave before Dems. He doesn‚Äôt seem to care how long government is shut down, whereas Dems are pounding the message of how fed workers are being hurt. In this type of showdown, the side that feels the most pain loses.
@ABC I just went to Colorado. Same as it ever was. Implementing legal marijuana just isn‚Äôt that hard. Accept that this is what your constituents want and make it happen.
@NateSilver538 They say you can sleep when you‚Äôre dead, but I don‚Äôt want to risk it, so I sleep in every weekend.
@SenSchumer @realDonaldTrump Get to the White House and start negotiating god damn it
@ripleydukes Solid perimeter check, Ripley.
@CraigHoffman Agree üíØ
@StaceyDales @nflnetwork @Colts @dsleon45 And a snappy dresser to boot.
@NateSilver538 Over/under on # candidates to run?
@KamalaHarris No
@DarrenSchaefer7 @Titans Teams need to do more of this. With every game on TV and a big screen in every home, you gotta go the extra mile to reward folks who show up on game day. Well done @Titans.
@Lescarpenter This game is going to be fun to watch.
@BuckyBrooks Also, his young QB showed no signs of improvement under his watch.
@BurgundyBlog @AlGaldi The only hope is that the ‚Äúpromotion‚Äù means BA does business only and DW/ES run the football side.
@BuckyBrooks @Chiefs A smart team would hire EB as HC and a bright young passing game OC. HCs have too much to focus on. Better to delegate to coordinators.
@AlbertBreer We could have a snow bowl and a mud bowl on the same day. Football is awesome.
@SenDuckworth Sen. Duckworth, if only you and @lisamurkowski were empowered to solve this. You‚Äôre both reasonable people who I know could work out a solution. As Ms. Caraway points out, women have always been good at making ends meet.
@senrobportman @JerryMoran I love this plan. @realDonaldTrump @SpeakerPelosi @SenSchumer what say you? Sounds like a win-win solution.
@senrobportman THANK YOU! https://t.co/kiofiRTVNx
@Dj2KewlBlue @DeepEddyVodka @SvenLloyd @RodKast Throw in some ice and you‚Äôll be in real good shape.
@ShowtimeBoxing Great fights tonight. üëç
@JonHeyman Do better, @astros. You can get to the fourth decimal place with your offer.
@lisamurkowski Thank you, Senator Murkowski. Eminently reasonable.
@SenDuckworth @HUDgov But he‚Äôs not going to. So, where does that leave us? Deal with reality on reality‚Äôs terms. Make a deal.
@KamalaHarris Hey, thanks for fiddling while Rome burns. Stop the blame game, get over yourselves, and MAKE A DEAL! While you tweet about nothing, real people are being hurt.
@ABC This helps end the shutdown not at all. Awesome stuff. Keep on blaming each other. I‚Äôm sure that‚Äôs going to turn out very well.
@chaddukes @TheRock I‚Äôd vote for him.
@Mullins1067 @Redskins If you voted for anything other than DJCP, you are a traitor and a scumbag.
@JayGlazer Especially at the airport, where you have limited choice.
@chaddukes @SmyrnaNews Natoli‚Äôs is going to be sad to hear this.
@ABC Can‚Äôt wait to hear the story behind this. It‚Äôll be a doozy, I‚Äôm sure.
@AOC @TheRevAl Appears he‚Äôs doing the Tawana Brawley.
@JudyWoodruff @NewsHour @LisaDNews Wow. Unexpected good news!
@MichaelDavSmith ‚ÄúOpen to interpretation‚Äù is the lazy way out.
@SenatorDurbin @AFGENational Seems like a great reason to get to the table and make a deal. What‚Äôs that? You‚Äôd rather stall another week with the blame game? Curious.
@hankschulman Glad some people still know Canasta is a thing.
@dorkdorkdork2 @KenTremendous They were big players in the douche arena, as I recall.
@youngsinick That‚Äôs a real low bar there fella
@CBSNews @annawerner Spot on, sir.
@NewsHour @JudyWoodruff 100% right.
@PattyMurray YES. Work together. Stop blaming and find a solution.
@stephaniekotuby @NewsHour @JudyWoodruff Yet we‚Äôre almost to a record long shutdown and neither side is budging even as workers are hurt. I think it‚Äôs 30 days plus before either side yields an inch. Sad to see.
@mattloff @NewsHour @realDonaldTrump But isn‚Äôt the counter true? Dem position is no wall or nothing.
@KamalaHarris How does this help stop the shutdown?
@realDonaldTrump There you go. Don‚Äôt kick the can down the road. Finish this now. MAKE A DEAL!
@schrine @GinaGrad I guarantee you it tastes amazing.
@GinaGrad @AdamCarollaShow Not sure what this is but I like it.
@DanRather Fair statement.
@KenTremendous A bold call to action. A nation waits with bated breath.......
@chicobrisbane @joelpollak @DonaldJTrumpJr But he‚Äôs said he won‚Äôt. So... what then?
@joelpollak @DonaldJTrumpJr I‚Äôd say he held serve. Didn‚Äôt give anything new, but did offer to meet with Dems and make a deal. Ball‚Äôs in Pelosi/Schumer‚Äôs court. Hope all of them can make a deal and get gov‚Äôt open.
@JoePerticone The puppy is super cute, in case y‚Äôall were wondering
@SenateDems @realDonaldTrump Y‚Äôall gonna meet POTUS tomorrow to make a deal?
@NateSilver538 Classic hold serve
@LRiddickESPN What I wonder is - how many connections does KK even have in the NFL? Could be hard for him to form a staff.
@cnnbrk People leaving jobs when they aren‚Äôt getting paid. Weird.
@SenSchumer @SpeakerPelosi Y‚Äôall can live-tweet it. Prob get better results that way. Have @AOC take point. She gets social media.
@chaddukes #NationOfHacks
@SenatorDurbin @AFGENational @TSA By the way, ask them if they give a f**k about the wall. Nope. They just want to get paid. MAKE A DEAL
@SenatorDurbin I‚Äôm sure demanding you get everything you want and the other side gets nothing is a real effective way to negotiate. Get real, Senator. Stop playing the blame game and make a deal.
@AlbertBreer I can‚Äôt count the number of times I‚Äôve seen Lawrence take a lick only to end up just stumbling away. Seems to be able to absorb hits really well.
@KenTremendous Less than zero interest
@Snide_Remarks #TankForTua
@EBJunkies Butt sick
@WSJ Who could have predicted this? Wild.
@CBSNews @krisvancleave Well, surely that means POTUS and Dem leaders are working toward a solution, right? What‚Äôs that? They‚Äôre just blaming each other and doing nothing? Sigh.
@nmesics @BuckyBrooks The angle is that there‚Äôs a proven way to get a quality HC: hire a proven NFL OC/DC. Doesn‚Äôt always work, but it‚Äôs your best shot. Deviating from that reeks of desperation.
@BasSuurland @BuckyBrooks Except McVay had proven himself as an NFL OC. Kingsbury hasn‚Äôt.
@BuckyBrooks He should come in as an OC. Head coach is way too big a jump. Always been good offensively, yet to prove he can run a whole team.
@PriscoCBS It‚Äôs simple. They‚Äôre punting this game for the future.
@BuckyBrooks @Chargers @Ravens Most underrated group in the NFL.
@RodKast @jinxedronin Yes yes a thousand times yes
@BuckyBrooks They have to. They just have to. Any further analysis is pointless.
@dcsportsbog @SoccerInsider Overserved
@mgarciaslug @nflnetwork @DerwinJames I assume the one on the helmet is a backup so he doesn‚Äôt need to leave the field if he loses the first one.

@KenTremendous I almost think doing that is some sort of bizarre talent. Lots of people can write a bad joke. How many can write one that seems full of sound &amp; fury but which signifies nothing?

@therealvera1 @NateSilver538 Hillary on a skateboard sounds OK. Thanks for the visual!
@McMickey98 @hmeridian2 @SenateGOP @realDonaldTrump I have zero expectation of getting anything from the gov‚Äôt. It‚Äôs why 401k‚Äôs exist.
@LSUgym @DhaSickest @SEC Geaux Breaux!
@ChrisMurphyCT @maddow @MSNBC Should be a hard-hitting interview.
@JoshNorris Yikes.
@MichaelSLinden @AOC It seems like the implication of the Diamond/Saez article is effectively how much milk you can get from the cow without it stopping production. Is that a fair layman‚Äôs characterization?
@Clara674 @KamalaHarris I just want the shutdown to be over. I‚Äôm agnostic as to how it happens.
@AussieDebBell @jackdl123 @KamalaHarris I like Ms. Harris. She might win the WH in 2020. I‚Äôd like her to help end the shutdown. It‚Äôd look great on her resume, don‚Äôt you think?
@DevinLocke9 @Olivias_Dad @NateSilver538 All I know is single-payer healthcare used to be a fringe idea. No more. To me that‚Äôs indicative of a shift.
@ChidiNwatu @Scavino45 @WhiteHouse I like it.
@SusanFair7 @Reuters Tends to happen when you get old. Thanks for outing yourself as an ageist.
@Reuters üôèü§ûüèª
@chelsea_janes We‚Äôre I the Dem party, I‚Äôd be terrified Warren is Hillary 2.0. You‚Äôd like to see another strategy rather than doubling down on something that failed last time.
@Scavino45 @WhiteHouse I recommend we lock them in until a deal is done.
@JonSwagman I voted for both of them.
@NYMag @EricLevitz Shocking to see @NYMag jumping to her defense. No one could have predicted that.
@mixedmedia2017 @cnni I'm sure you have absolutely no partisan slant whatsoever. Anyone who can see the world clearly knows it takes give and take from both sides to reach a deal. Placing blame on one side or the other is just silly.
@cluckeryDuckery @judywalks2 @KamalaHarris But he's not going to. So.... we just let the shutdown go on forever? Live in reality, sir. Trump is who he is. He's not changing. Expecting him to magically stop caring about the wall is foolish to the extreme.
@js_got_takes @NateSilver538 * happy
@js_got_takes @NateSilver538 Maybe I'm wrong. Maybe post-Trump the Democratic party will return to being more centrist. It just doesn't feel to me like that's what will happen. It feels like both parties are happing moving farther and farther apart.
@js_got_takes @NateSilver538 I voted for Obama twice. I'm a fan. But I would suggest to you that things have dramatically changed since he left the oval office. Before then, the ACA was seen as maybe too far left. Now? It's close to full on socialism.
@Olivias_Dad @NateSilver538 I'm being bombastic. I just pine for a party in the center. Having a choice of two extremes is incredibly depressing. Sadly, each half of America cares more about proving itself right than being united.
@lisamurkowski Always take care of the Connies. They're the ones who keep the trains running on time. Best of luck Connie!
@_cromer043 @NateSilver538 Here is actually pretty good, if you ignore the nonsense social media echo chamber.
@cluckeryDuckery @judywalks2 @KamalaHarris We're already hearing about potentially very long lines at airports due to TSA shortages. Thanks for that. I'm sure "stopping the wall" is worth that. Let me thank you in advance for making my travel hell so you can make a nonsense stand against Trump. Awesome stuff.
@cnni Keep on encouraging your side to not give an inch. I'm sure it's going to turn out really well and not result in hourslong lines in airports. Or, maybe we could try some compromise?
@SenatorDurbin If you actually care about fed workers, that is. If not, please continue on with the party line of trying to shift blame rather than forge a compromise. I'm sure that's going to go well. We're already facing potential disaster in our airports due to TSA shortages.
@SenatorDurbin But he's not going to. You know that. Maybe you ought to be working toward a compromise with the POTUS rather than working the PR front.
@NateSilver538 Does anyone care about electing a moderate any more? That's my dream. I don't understand why both sides seem to want an extremist. It's almost as if we're trying to fracture the country down the middle.
@Lookswellstudio @cnnbrk Attention dumbass: he said he'd keep the government shut down for months or years, not that they'd work for free. If you had a shred of intelligence you'd realize they'd find other employment rather than working for free. Thanks for playing.
@cnnbrk Awesome. Thanks for keeping that shutdown going, DC! I'm sure chaos at the airport tomorrow morning won't affect anyone at all.
@hmeridian2 @SenateGOP @realDonaldTrump 65% of the almost $4 trillion budget is entitlements. Maybe the way to fix the deficit is to look at those. Adjustments like raising the age of Social Security eligibility by a year or two would make a huge dent in the deficit.
@SenateGOP I got about $200 extra per paycheck. Happy about that.
@Mullins1067 @MoveTheSticks Best bit ever.
@ABC Gee, ya think?
@DJC00675980 @jackdl123 @KamalaHarris "cites", you dullard.
@DJC00675980 @jackdl123 @KamalaHarris That was before POTUS changed his mind. Then he did. Adapt to the new reality. Try and keep up.
@ChrisMurphyCT Thanks for a pointless tweet. Go get something done and stop trying to win the PR war.
@ABC Thanks @RepCummings. Time to tone down the rhetoric and get stuff done.
@NTB_ShineOn @usey0urbra1n @ABC Hey, f**kface: maybe the idea is to slow people down, not prevent them from climbing. Ever thought about that? By the way, been to Mexico recently? I wouldn't say following their advice is a very good idea.
@NTB_ShineOn @usey0urbra1n @ABC Board a flight? Are you high? What about people that want to cross on land? I'm going to mute you since you clearly just want to debate endlessly rather than find a solution. Have a great life.
@cheech20101 @NTB_ShineOn @ABC My point is, debating funding for foreign countries right now is like drawing up blueprints for a new house when your existing house is burning down. Priorities, man. Deal with what's in front of us now. Extinguish the fire. Everything else can wait.
@usey0urbra1n @NTB_ShineOn @ABC While y'all babble, federal workers are still not paid. This is the problem writ large. Talk does nothing. GET SOMETHING DONE. Ask your elected representatives to DO SOMETHING and stop spewing political nonsense.
@CNNPolitics If you use the term "claps back", you are officially no longer real journalism. For Christ's sake, I remember when CNN was respected and didn't sound like a ninth grade teenager.
@cheech20101 @NTB_ShineOn @ABC Who gives a f**k what we spend on other countries? That has zero relevance to the crisis currently facing us. We all want to get fed workers paid. We do that by getting Schumer/Pelosi/Trump in a room to agree on a number. This is not complex.
@NTB_ShineOn @usey0urbra1n @ABC If you give a f**k about who's to blame, you're part of the problem. For Christ's sake, you sound like you should be on a Real Housewives show. Stop with the dramatic hand-wringing. You're not Han Solo. You're not a part of some nonsense resistance. Get over yourself.
@NTB_ShineOn @ABC Mexico paying for it was always nonsense. And hey, if you want to shut down the government to "send a message", I think you sound like a teenager. Adults get things done, not "send messages".
@NTB_ShineOn @ABC Fact: the budget is ~$4 trillion. $5B is 0.1% of that. It's a rounding error. It isn't worth an endless shutdown. Get what you can, negotiate hard, but get it done. That's their job, not bloviating about how the other side is wrong.
@NTB_ShineOn @ABC This isn't significant in any way. It's a minor outlay for something we may or may not need. The problem is now it's a proxy for Trump/racism/etc. Get the emotion out, realize it's not a big deal, and move on.
@NTB_ShineOn @ABC Think about this: it's been recently reported Medicare overspent billions of dollars. Where's the outrage about that? Oh, there is none? It's because billions really aren't that important in the grand scheme of things.
@NTB_ShineOn @ABC Who cares? Worst case we don't really need it. $5B is *nothing* in the budget. It's not worth shutting government down over. Dems don't need to cave. They need to negotiate the POTUS down to a number he can agree to.
@usey0urbra1n @NTB_ShineOn @ABC Or maybe it does. Who cares? Again - the point is this isn't some sort of radical proposal. Maybe the existing stuff is fine. Maybe it's not. It isn't worth shutting the government down for. Get in a room and agree on a number, and do it now.
@NTB_ShineOn @ABC I mean, seriously, what's the harm of $2.5B or whatever it ends up being to fortify the existing walls, or replace fences with slats, or whatever? Worst case it's not the most efficient use of money. Do you really think that's uncommon for the government?
@NTB_ShineOn @ABC To get federal workers back to work. I don't care if it's $0 or $5B. Pelosi/Schumer/Trump need to get in a room and agree on a number. Point being, the Dem stance that it's some sort of unthinkable human rights abuse to put up a wall is first class fiction.
@granthpaulsen If only we could identify some common thread here that might be the cause.....
@tommycanyou @ABC Thanks for contributing nothing to the discussion.
@ABC I mean, if you want to call Trump out on every fiction, fair play, but please call out Pelosi for suggesting somehow we're crossing the rubicon here. A wall is not a new idea. It's already there.
@ABC Can someone please ask her why if it's not who we are why we already have 700 miles of walls/fences/etc? https://t.co/FZylYrUWGA
@davidcicilline Keep on playing the blame game. I'm sure that's going to help end the shutdown.
@repdavidtrone Hey, thanks for a tweet full of sound and fury signifying nothing.
@michaelpRTD And Taylor got murdered mid-career. This franchise is cursed.
@BurgundyBlog If the Skins had drafted him he'd have blown out his knee.
@jackdl123 @uelmendrado @shamapoo @CaseyCat What sucks is 800k fed workers not getting paid. I don't give a f**k how much the wall gets or doesn't get so long as they go back to work. I have zero interest in this nonsense. Get in a room and agree on a number.
@DPrabhata @cnni @AOC Good luck with that. If you ask me, PT Barnum was right. There's a sucker born every minute.
@SenSherrodBrown I'm sure saying he's throwing a temper tantrum will help end the shutdown. Nice job, Senator.
@CaryGirl1 @CBSNews @POTUS Federal workers just want to get back to work and get a paycheck. I guarantee you that's all they care about.
@ABC Hey, a legal challenge! That should really speed up the process of ending the shutdown.
@KamalaHarris That's gonna hurt white folks bad. You know we can't dance.
@amyklobuchar Please run in 2020, Senator. There are precious few Democrats I'd be happy to vote for. You are one of them.
@MurreyJacobson Two sides saying they won't give an inch. Tremendous news for those of us hoping the shutdown will end soon.
@tenzingmckenzie @SenateDems @ChrisVanHollen @MargotRobbie And hey, Margot, if you're open to a date, I'm happy to consult my schedule to see if I can fit it in.
@tenzingmckenzie @SenateDems @ChrisVanHollen You need two-thirds of the Senate to override. There's a greater chance I have a date with @MargotRobbie than the Senate overriding POTUS' veto. It will not happen.
@jackdl123 @KamalaHarris I hope you're having fun in whatever alternate reality you're living in. Here in the real world, that's not happening. You also need 2/3s of the Senate and good luck with that. You'd have better luck repealing the law of gravity.
@SenateDems @ChrisVanHollen I mean, seriously, it's like saying you're leaving Friday open for a date who already turned you down. You can keep it open all you want. She already said no. Sometimes no is no and you move on.
@SenateDems @ChrisVanHollen Did y'all read the White House announcement that he'd veto the bill if it hits his desk?
@Reuters Please, God, make a deal happen. I'm not religious but I might start if you can get this one done.
@senrobportman @SenateFloor #bipartisanship We're all Americans.
@CBSNews @POTUS Where can we buy this drug-finding equipment? Asking for a friend.
@PattyMurray Sen. Murray, I've always appreciated your pragmatism. You know POTUS has said he'll veto the bill. Please encourage your colleagues to do something that might actually result in an end to the shutdown rather than engage in an endless blame game.
@MartinHeinrich I'm serious. No food, no water, no sleep until there's a solution. I guarantee you that ends the shutdown.
@MartinHeinrich If the goal is to score political points, by all means continue on your present course. If you actually care about ending the shutdown, get Pelosi/Schumer/Trump in a room and don't let them out until they agree on something.
@MartinHeinrich 1) He's already said he'll veto it 2) Since when has he been known for doing the right thing? It's dead on arrival and you know it.
@DPrabhata @cnni @AOC Unfair? Absolutely, but that's how politics works. People sling mud for a reason - it works. When you load the mud into your opponent's slinger, you're doing it wrong, and it's no surprise a novice like @AOC bumbled right into it. She's trying to do right. Not how DC works.
@DPrabhata @cnni @AOC This just isn't a new thing. Seriously, the 3 main factors in Dukakis/Bush were 1) the tank video 2) the Willie Horton ad 3) Bernard Shaw asking Dukakis if he would support the death penalty if his wife were raped and murdered. Races come down to those things.
@DPrabhata @cnni @AOC If CNN can spin a narrative, just imagine what GOP attack ads will look like. It'll be a bloodbath. I don't think you understand how politics work. Dukakis rode in a tank and lost the election. Optics are everything.
@DPrabhata @cnni @AOC Because the GOP is known for not twisting comments and lying for a narrative? Good lord. Are you really that naive? It doesn't matter what's true. A democrat saying up to 60 or 70 percent into a microphone regarding taxes is a disaster.
@SInow When are we going to bow to reality and move this franchise? It's cruel to let it rot on the vine. There are plenty of cities that would do better.
@Ediemcgee @PTOWPS @ChrisMurphyCT @RonWyden THANK YOU! That is the only point that matters. Stop babbling about who's to blame, get in a room, and agree on something. That's your job. You aren't PR. You're supposed to keep the country running, not grandstand about how you're right and they're wrong.
@HalJordanstar @CBSNews @SpeakerPelosi Well, Speaker Pelosi said a wall on the border is immoral, so effectively she's saying the administrations that put them up were immoral, right? I'd just like to be clear on that point. If it's immoral now, it was immoral then. She's criticizing our government.
@chaddukes @TimVirgin @BigOandDukes I love his Diamond David Lee Roth story.
@CBSNews @SenSchumer So nothing was accomplished. Awesome stuff, folks. Glad we have you in Washington to get nothing done aside from blaming each other. Can we elect you to lifetime terms? Is that possible?
@CaseyCat @jackdl123 @uelmendrado @shamapoo POTUS has already publicly stated he'll veto the bill. Tell me: what's the point in sending POTUS something he's going to veto? So we can get him on the record he's pro-wall? So the Senate can not override that veto? Give me a reason doing it does anything.
@PTOWPS @ChrisMurphyCT @RonWyden I'll count you as a "no" vote to end the shutdown. Thanks!
@cnni I like @AOC's energy, but to say this on your first day in office is an unforced error. The last thing Dems need is to willingly wear the "tax and spend" crown. Hearing any Dem say 70% tax rate is not going to help Dems in critical battlegrounds for 2020.
@Delta Wow - juice is really taking a pounding.
@judywalks2 @KamalaHarris The way we get there is by finding a mutually acceptable solution to this crisis. I'm amenable to some of what she's for, but that's for the future. We have an emergency in front of us now. We need to focus on that. You don't draw up blueprints when your house is on fire.
@10ruerivoli @KamalaHarris But they're not going to. Live in reality, please. In the real world, there's zero chance of a veto override, and none of your clever phrasing does anything to change that.
@jackdl123 @KamalaHarris POTUS has veto power. Sen. Harris doesn't. The reality is that the POTUS has said publicly he'd veto the bill if it reached him, which makes everything Dems are doing pointless. If you want to win the blame game, fine, but understand it does nothing toward ending the shutdown.
@jackdl123 @uelmendrado @shamapoo @CaseyCat Riddle me this: what does shifting blame around do to end the shutdown? That's right - nothing. No one should care who gets blamed. What we need is a solution, not nonsense about who's to blame. Unless you want an endless shutdown, in which case carry on.
@CaseyCat @KamalaHarris Are you aware the White House issued a statement saying POTUS would veto the bill? It'd be pointless for McConnell to do anything knowing it will be vetoed with zero chance of that veto being overridden. Placing blame does nothing to end the shutdown.
@PTOWPS @ChrisMurphyCT @RonWyden Also, the White House publicly said POTUS would veto those bills, which makes McConnell irrelevant. If you want to end the shutdown, get to the table and negotiate. If not, by all means, please keep passing bills that have zero chance of going anywhere.
@LisaDNews Shutdown IIII: Dark Territory. Get Seagal into the room. He gets results.
@LisaDNews I love the roman numerals, but we need better names. I'm thinking: Shutdown IIII - American Showdown. Open to suggestions.
@AOC That's right. We'll hate you for your 70% tax rate proposal. I said it would be 75% and Twitter laughed at me. Turns out I was fairly close to the mark. But by all means, keep up your social media tour. I'm sure that was what you were elected to do, not actually get things done.
@rachelwellford @NewsHour Bless you for covering what matters: the people who have zero voice in this shutdown but are the only ones affected. Good to know there's at least some responsible journalism going on. I hope your reporting makes an impact on ending the shutdown.
@DavidNakamura @seungminkim Good lord. Did you get into journalism to hound people about grammar and spelling? Please go do something useful, which is literally anything else. Cleaning the toilets would at least be useful.
@CNNPolitics It's good to know we can rely on CNN to cover vitally important issues like this.
@bscherff68 Dude, I wish I could be one one hundredth of the man you are.
@ChrisMurphyCT @RonWyden Sens Murphy and Wyden: how about we get to work on ending the shutdown rather than feeding the base red meat? I mean, if you came to DC to get things done rather than posture.
@SenSchumer @realDonaldTrump Sen. Schumer: not sure you heard, but the White House issued a statement that POTUS will veto those bills. Can you elaborate on how passing a bill that will be vetoed helps end the shutdown?
@SenatorHassan @senatemajldr @realDonaldTrump Sen. Hassan - any chance you read the White House statement that POTUS will veto those bills? Seems kinda important, unless you're into passing bills that have a 100% chance of being vetoed and a 0% chance of that veto being overridden.
@RepJeffries Awesome stuff, Rep. Jeffries. I'm sure the 800k unpaid federal workers are happy to hear that. No chance "hell no" leads to the longest federal shutdown in history. By the way, we already have 700 miles of fencing/walls/etc on the southern border, but I'm sure you know that.
@RepLawrence @HouseDemocrats Any chance we can get some movement on a true emergency - the 800k unpaid workers suffering from the shutdown? Methinks that's more important to solve than basically anything else you might name. I mean, if you care about them, which I would imagine you do.
@jonfavs Hey, thanks for throwing more gas on the fire rather than working for a solution. No chance you're contributing to the length of the shutdown rather than shortening it.
@KenTremendous This is so embarrassing for both parties. At least have the common decency to have a duel rather than a dance-off. Christ.
@RonWyden Sen. Wyden, do you think this helps the solution, or does it throw more gas on the fire? I think it's the latter. Please consider advocating for a solution rather than fanning the partisan flames. The fire's already burning plenty bright. We need a fire extinguisher, not more gas
@KarolinaDaze67 @CNNPolitics Good. All I want is a solution. It's fine for both sides to set "non-negotiable" markers so long as they negotiate from there. Honestly, I don't care whether it's $0 or $5B for the wall. I just want fed workers to get paid. Not fair to hurt them over this issue.
@Artymedon @CNNPolitics A border flamenco would be amazing.
@2andparker @CNNPolitics But now that Dems have declared war on people who are pale, male, and stale (in the words of a Dem strategist) it's made it quite easy for me to realize neither party represents me. Have fun in your all-inclusive tent that demonizes white men. I'll be outside.
@2andparker @CNNPolitics I'm not sure you are, because you implied Dems are running the show now, which is completely wrong. By the way, I was a lifelong Democrat until the party lost its mind and became the neo-socialist party. I've voted for a GOP candidate once in my life, and that was a state office.
@kellevij @CNNPolitics Boy, are you clueless. Literally every POTUS has used the Oval Office as a bully pulpit (which is what you meant). There are a lot of legitimate complaints you can make re: Trump. That is not one.
@2andparker @CNNPolitics Are you aware the GOP still controls half of Congress and the White House? Controlling the House != running the show.
@KosKretins @JennaJanaki @CNNPolitics https://t.co/FZylYrDlP2 - 700 miles already, and what's not covered is a lot of rivers and mountains that don't need them. Most of the border that doesn't have a natural barrier has fencing/walls/etc. Your response?
@KosKretins @JeffMacIsHere @CNNPolitics McConnell's already said he's not bringing up a bill without support from POTUS. Live in reality, sir. Playing the blame game does nothing for federal workers. How about we talk about real solutions rather than play pin the blame on the politician?
@tlc258 @CNNPolitics LOL! 800k fed workers aren't getting paid! LOL! Responsible attitude you have, sir. Consider running for public office. I'm sure you'll go far.
@RoxxieV @CNNPolitics @TheDemocrats I'm sure fed workers who aren't getting paid are thrilled to know that. They can pay their bills with your blame, right?
@ClaudiaLamb @CNNPolitics Both sides are doing this. Pelosi/Schumer have already said zero dollars for a wall, non-negotiable. If you castigate POTUS for making non-negotiable demands, you ought to castigate Pelosi/Schumer equally.
@Deborahgriewsk1 @CNNPolitics Well, he is still POTUS, so yeah. He can veto anything Congress sends him and the votes to override a veto aren't there. Do people understand that? Veto power is incredibly powerful. Call him a bully and extortionist if you want; that doesn't negate his power.
@KarolinaDaze67 @CNNPolitics This is a serious question. Do you understand Dems control the House and the GOP controls the Senate, and the House and Senate are both parts of Congress, which is one third of the power structure? That basically means the GOP has two thirds of the power.
@JohnHipps @CNNPolitics And one half of Congress is controlled by the GOP. It's simplistic, but you can say that means they have two thirds and Dems have one third. Winning the House is not winning Congress. Not sure the Dem base understands that.
@JeffMacIsHere @CNNPolitics God, I hope not. Can you imagine being a federal worker who isn't getting paid seeing that? Go listen to those workers. They don't really care about the outcome. They just want to go back to work and get paid.
@dlc2558 @CNNPolitics I like Barack Obama, but he spent 6 of his 8 years basically getting nothing done because Congress opposed everything he did. To say he accomplished a lot as POTUS is incorrect. The ACA and Bin Laden are basically his list of signature accomplishments.
@EvingerRobert @CNNPolitics Did you see today's jobs numbers? There's a lot to criticize Trump about. The economy's probably the last one you should be criticizing.
@fval_1 @CNNPolitics @realDonaldTrump He still has veto power, he's said he will use it, and the votes aren't there to override that veto. Does he have less leverage? Sure. But the power to veto is HUGE leverage. It might be the most powerful tool a POTUS has.
@JennaJanaki @CNNPolitics YES. KEEP FED WORKERS UNPAID! IT'S TOTALLY COHERENT TO STAND AGAINST A WALL WHEN MOST OF THE SOUTHERN BORDER ALREADY HAS ONE!
@wookietim @CNNPolitics What do you call the power to veto a bill? You're saying that's not a large amount of power?
@CNNPolitics "Democrats don't plan on moving off their position ... at least until Republican senators come back to Washington next week". Awesome stuff. Good to know there's a sense of urgency to get fed workers paid. I'm sure they're happy to wait a week before there's movement.
@KamalaHarris Sen. Harris, you must know this is dead on arrival. Please work on a constructive solution that the POTUS will actually sign so 800k fed workers can get paid. This is nothing more than posturing for 2020.
@JPFinlayNBCS World needs plenty of coasters.
@No1Denmark @CBSNews Ask yourself: why do you care about this issue? Do you find a lot of Americans are interjecting themselves into Danish politics? I'm guessing the answer is no. The very fact you're commenting on this is proof positive of how important we are as a country.
@hlebowi2 @sandycompany @CNNPolitics @SpeakerPelosi Then work on your self-control. Your inability to control yourself is no one's problem but yours.
@thatsmyopinnion @CBSNews I didn't vote for Trump. I voted for Hillary. I don't particularly like him. I'm OK with not being politically correct. Profanity isn't political correctness. But hey, whatever. If you want the country to turn into a mud-slinging embarrassment, bully for you.
@OpieRadio @TheEllenShow @KevinHart4real Couldn't agree more. What's better - send Kevin to exile or use this as a teaching moment for the country? I'll take the latter every time. In fact, why not have Ellen bring him on stage as a way to bridge the divide? Y'all can work up an amazing bit, I'm sure.
@Reuters If you aren't a fish, maybe consider staying off the water.
@thatsmyopinnion @CBSNews Both can be wrong, you dullard. Perhaps you've heard the saying two wrongs don't make a right?
@cmclymer Did he say them publicly? If not, it's apples and oranges. We all know people use different language in a private setting than in a public one. I remember two great Americans saying "We can disagree without being disagreeable" and "when they go low, we go high". Remember that?
@CNNPolitics "I don't like that kind of language" and then move on to Trump-bashing. Wow. Way to really denounce something, Rep. Nadler. Glad to know the Democratic party's really taking a strong stand against this profanity by a member of Congress.
@hlebowi2 @sandycompany @CNNPolitics @SpeakerPelosi And I'm terribly saddened by how many people are cheering her on. You can dislike Trump without being profane. The way she's conducted herself is absolutely unacceptable and if you condone it you're wrong, full stop.
@hlebowi2 @sandycompany @CNNPolitics @SpeakerPelosi Sorry - when you're in Congress, you're always representing Congress. You don't get to separate church and state. I'm a lifelong Democrat - although no more since the party hates people like me - and it's flat-out embarrassing for her to do this a day into her term.
@No1Denmark @CBSNews Stay out of this, Denmark, and be thankful our military stands ready to defend you should the need arise. By the way, our economy's doing great. Maybe you heard all the way across the pond. Bonus: you're welcome for your ass being saved in two world wars.
@CNNPolitics Yes. As a Dem strategist said, he's pale, male, and stale. That just won't fly in today's Democratic party. As another person who's pale, male, and stale, goodbye Democratic party and hello independence. I'll not be part of a party that openly makes war on people like me.
@CBSNews And don't give me any of this "he started it". That is first class nonsense. That's an argument for a child. You want to fight his agenda? Go ahead. Don't do it in a profane manner. She's embarrassed the country and ought to apologize.
@CBSNews I'm embarrassed to have called myself a Democrat most of my life. It's shameful for a member of Congress to say something like this, and if you cheer her on, you're wrong. It doesn't matter what you think of the POTUS. This language is unacceptable.
@ABC Some call it speaking truth to power. Others call it being an inveterate asshole.
@IanJ_Lewis @pattonoswalt And Mrs. Police Chief don‚Äôt like anyone agitating me other than her.
@IanJ_Lewis @pattonoswalt I SAID GET OUT! Now you‚Äôre agitating my arthritis.
@IanJ_Lewis @pattonoswalt You think this is my first rodeo? Huh-uh. Welcome to the big city, son. Don‚Äôt let the door hit you in the ass on the way out.
@pattonoswalt Hey! I‚Äôm a grizzled police chief. I‚Äôll tell you what really grinds my gears - rookie cops who play by their own rules. Badge and gun, son. Now! You‚Äôre on the bench. And don‚Äôt even think about sticking your nose into this investigation.
@pattonoswalt Rode. God damn you autocorrect.
@pattonoswalt I have it on good authority Buffalo Bill Cody carried no less than 13 religious tomes when he road across the west.
@CBSNews Hey, he‚Äôs not ground chuck. I‚Äôd say he‚Äôs outkicked his coverage.
@geoffschwartz Glad I followed you, sir.
@CBSNews @RepBrianMast @ElectJimBaird @DanCrenshawTX This is awesome.
@CBSEveningNews @CBSNews @JanetShamlian Get this mf‚Äôer.
@DeMarcusWare That‚Äôs awesome, man. Hope I see you out on the slopes. ‚õ∑
@CNNPolitics Come on, people. He‚Äôs sacrificing for you!
@CBSNews @SpeakerPelosi Do we think she‚Äôs aware a good bit of the southern border already has walls/fences/barriers/slats?
@PatrickClaybon Hope he died in a hail of gunfire.
@kerplooey10 @_DeadFred @CBSNews @Lynda_Tran Improving the world is one thing. Demonizing one particular group is quite another. How about we work for solutions rather than play identity politics?
@geoffschwartz It‚Äôs no Candlestick.
@NFL Please stop with the roman numerals.
@CBSNews @Lynda_Tran Good lord. Why not just declare open war on white men?
@RamsNFL Can someone please ask him what his annual hair product budget is?
@wingoz And undertakers.
@AP_Politics At least have the common decency to say white men are evil rather than just implying it.
@watch_SITV @theMMQB @JamesConner_ &amp; Jaylen Samuels easily replaced Bell. 21 less yards from scrimmage but 5 more TDs. I'd love for someone to explain how they'd have been better off with Bell, his excessive salary, and his bad attitude when he can be easily replaced.

@chaddukes @shirtless_rican More importantly, when will @CuckinAround adopt this as their official logo?
@pattonoswalt @AOC Well, it was just a few months ago she graduated, right?
@ABC Oh my god. That is so embarrassing. I don't care what party you're for. If your elected representative is taking selfies, please vote them out.
@RickGosselin9 An arbitrary number is always nonsense.
@FairfaxCountyPD Nice job, y'all. We appreciate you!
@Reuters A person or corporation trying to lower their taxes by any means they can? Wow. This truly is breaking news. You mean people don't demand they pay more in taxes? Great insight.
@mcgill256 @Reuters That's why Dems are always at a disadvantage in a shutdown. They're pro-government. The right dislikes government. They're happy to let it go on to get what they want while Dems bleed out and eventually cave in. That's how the world works - red in tooth and claw. It's a jungle.
@mcgill256 @Reuters Feel free not to like that. I don't. But that's reality. There is no way on this earth Dems can hold out for longer than Trump. It's not happening. Perhaps you disagree, and that's fine, but as I see the world, he's willing to accept months of shutdown and Dems aren't.
@mcgill256 @Reuters Trump is the guy who'd rather crash his car into you than veer off. Doesn't that square with everything you know about him? He's a madman. He doesn't care. Dems do. In a game of chicken, that is everything. If you're going to veer off first, the game's already won.
@mcgill256 @Reuters And if you agree with that, then here are your choices: 1) go to the table and negotiate a number or 2) accept that the shutdown will go on for months. That's it. There are no other options. Which do you pick? See why Dems have to negotiate? It's a game of chicken they can't win.
@mcgill256 @Reuters I mostly agree with you, I think. But your arguments don't amount to a hill of beans. Trump is as Trump does. Do you really think he's going to give in on this, his signature project? There's just no way. If Dems are going to keep the "no wall" posture, shutdown will be months.
@mcgill256 @Reuters I know. Hard to believe, right? Someone who can see the world clearly instead of through a nonsense partisan lens? I voted for Hillary. I voted for Obama. I voted for Kerry (I think I voted that year anyway). The only vote I've ever cast for the GOP is for Tim Hugo in Va Senate.
@KungFuWaffles @Reuters Great. I'm sure federal workers who can't pay bills will really take comfort that Trump's to blame. How much do they get for the blame being assigned to him? Oh, it's nothing and they still can't pay bills? Awesome solution, man. Run for Congress. You'll fit right in.
@mcgill256 @Reuters By the way, I voted for Hillary. I've been a lifelong Dem. But I can see clearly, unlike most of the left. All of your hatred of Trump amounts to nothing in the real world. He's in the oval office, he has power, he's using it. That's the real world.
@mcgill256 @Reuters That's the problem with most of Twitter. Your argument boils down to "here's what Trump should do", which is complete nonsense. He's going to do what he wants to do. If you can't square with that, you have no place in this debate. That's the real world.
@mcgill256 @Reuters Well, there's a gentleman in the Oval Office who doesn't agree with you. His opinion matters. Yours doesn't. Assume he's not going to give in. What? We stay shut down for months? That's a ludicrous posture. You're not living in reality.
@mcgill256 @Reuters Hey, thanks for proposing a solution. Oh wait, you didn't. Here's mine: lock Trump/Pelosi/Schumer in a room and do not let them out until they come to an agreement. Problem solved. Clearly you'd rather see political grandstanding than solutions. I find that sad.
@KungFuWaffles @Reuters If you want to say that's his fault, so be it. He has the veto power granted to him by the Constitution. I'm more interested in solutions than placing blame. Unfortunately, you and a good chunk of America care more about blaming Trump than solving problems.
@KungFuWaffles @Reuters Live in reality, sir. That's not happening. I understand in your magical world Trump isn't president, but in the real world he is, and there's no way he's going to agree to that.
@dcsportsbog Guessing there‚Äôs a lot of tumbleweed blowing through there along with a cricket symphony.
@MySportsUpdate Good guy @DeAndreHopkins. Leader in the clubhouse for 2019 NFL man of the year.
@Koringul @tailgatingdavem @GrenadiAdrian @RapSheet @TMZ @Redskins @NFL @49ers I know it's only a few days in but that might be the funniest thing I will read all year. Well done, sir.
@KungFuWaffles @Reuters And by the way, saying Trump is the only one standing in the way is clueless. Only an idiot would think "I give you everything and get nothing" is anywhere close to a reasonable position. Sir, I posit you are that idiot.
@KungFuWaffles @Reuters And kick the can down the road a month? What's that going to do? Because that's what Pelosi's proposing. We get back here in a month. POTUS/Congress need a long-term fix, not another shutdown in a month.
@mcgill256 @Reuters Understand this has nothing to do with right and wrong. You can hate Trump and the wall all you want. That hate will not make a whit of difference in solving the shutdown. Both sides have to give. If you can't see that, you're lost in a partisan haze.
@mcgill256 @Reuters If Schumer/Pelosi gave Trump his $5.6B for a wall, it's fixed. If you think one side or the other is responsible, you're just not a smart person. Every negotiation takes two to tango. And if your opening volley is "we get everything and you get nothing", you're not dancing.
@MarkMaske Which finishes first: the Mueller investigation or the @NFL investigation into Foster? Both are moving at a pace that can only be described as glacial.
@drabtshirt @BigOandDukes @ShakyKnee https://t.co/NkRD29hC14
@drabtshirt @BigOandDukes Embarrassing is the word you're looking for. Christ. No man should ever send that message. By the way, recall that the previous use of "if you respect me" was @ShakyKnee talking about Katie from NY. An episode was named after it. We don't need "If You Respect Me 2".
@RapSheet @NFLprguy For Christ's sake. Why even issue a press release when its contents are meaningless?
@ABC @KFaulders How about you transform the shutdown into fed workers getting paid? That'd be a nice start.
@Reuters I'm sure the base appreciates the kabuki theater, but understand this is a middle finger to fed employees who aren't getting paid. It has a less than zero chance of going anywhere. Pure grandstanding. Hate Trump all you want. Dems are doing nothing to actually resolve shutdown.
@Reuters "Democrats ... maneuvered to pass legislation that would end a 13-day partial government shutdown while ignoring President Donald Trump‚Äôs demand for $5 billion for a border wall." That's what you call a non-starter in a negotiation.
@JHShattu @Zerthwind @WhiteHouse @ICEgov It has to go directly through the POTUS. It's not going to work any other way. McConnell has said that much publicly and there's no reason to believe that will change. The only way this gets done is Trump/Schumer/Pelosi in a room and stay there until a deal is done.
@CNNPolitics Call me crazy, but I think his sad showing in the 2016 primaries ruled him out a long time ago.
@NFL @DeAndreHopkins Wait - the WR who led the AFC in receiving yards is going to be a problem in the playoffs? This is breaking news. Nice job. Not sure what we'd do without this kind of surgical insight.
@BuckyBrooks @dak @NFL Anyone who says otherwise is clueless and ought not be listened to ever again.
@BuckyBrooks I'd like to know what idiots are being critical of @Dak because to me, he's one of the greatest draft picks in @NFL history in terms of value. When you can get a player like he's become in the fourth round, that is genius-level acquisition of talent.
@GrenadiAdrian @RapSheet @TMZ @Redskins @NFL @49ers @JJWatt You're a moron. Have a great life not understanding anything going on in the world!
@CBSNews Thank you for actual reporting, not rhetoric. Think whatever you want of Trump. I don't like him very much. But the notion of spending billions on border fencing/walls/slats/etc is not a new thing. The only reason it's controversial now is because of who's in the Oval Office.
@Zerthwind @WhiteHouse @ICEgov Of course he's going to say that publicly. Do you understand anything about negotiating? You're a fool if you publicly give ground. Smart people get in a room, privately negotiate the number, agree, and move on. That's how deals get done, not via the media.
@GrenadiAdrian @RapSheet @TMZ @Redskins @NFL @49ers He got pummeled by @JJWatt. The man is a beast. No shame in that. By the way, our season completely tanked after we lost him, so your point is completely invalid. Thanks for playing, dullard.
@JHShattu @Zerthwind @WhiteHouse @ICEgov Yes. He's crazy and mercurial. The entire country knows that. If Schumer/Pelosi/Trump sit in a room and actually negotiate, I guarantee you they can agree on a dollar figure. This isn't a game. Fed workers aren't getting paid. Get it done, period.
@JPFinlayNBCS @TMZ_Sports ... after which point we get a great player in his prime. Please give Doug Williams the credit here. It's a genius move.
@ameliatd I'm sure it's a wild coincidence it's coming before the ninth circuit court of appeals. We need to stop the nonsense venue shopping on both sides of the aisle.
@CNNPolitics Think about the people you know who are most active on social media and ask yourself: "Is it a good think my elected representative is like that person?". For me the answer's a clear no. I'd rather my House rep be doing something other than snapchatting. Read a book.
@LATimesfarmer Counterpoint: @bakermayfield. No defensive player can turn a franchise 180 degrees. A QB can. It's the most valuable position in the game and it's not close. Sorry if that angers great defensive players, but that's reality.
@RapSheet @TMZ @Redskins have suffered the slings and arrows from the entire @NFL for decades under the Snyder regime. Please give us some credit for this one. We poached a first rounder from the @49ers. Genius move by Doug Williams.
@Zerthwind @WhiteHouse @ICEgov Then Schumer/Pelosi can negotiate him down. Call it a fence, or slats, or whatever appeases the Dem base. Come up with a number, call it something that makes everyone happy, get fed workers paid, and move on. That's what responsible adults do, not quibble like children.
@MrChickSports Of course not, but it makes the PR situation a lot better, which is really what this is all about.
@WhiteHouse @ICEgov Folks, also remember that we already have hundreds and hundreds of miles of walls/fencing/slats/etc on the southern border. This is not crossing the Rubicon. This is just adding more to what previous administrations on both sides already built.
@granthpaulsen Give them credit. They took the short-term PR hit, but they're going to end up with an extra first round draft pick. Worst case he's suspended six games and then you have a year and a half of him, plus a potential option to pick up. Football-wise, a brilliant move.
@FieldYates Keep on drafting RBs with the #4 pick and see how that works out.
@TMZ Nice job, @49ers. We poached a first round draft pick from you. Dummies. Anytime the @Redskins organization does that to you, you did something very, very dumb, because we're very incompetent.
@CNNPolitics For Christ's sake, CNN. You used to be a real news organization. Now, this, an article that belongs in Tiger Beat magazine? Please stop embarrassing yourself. Report what's going on. Stop telling us what to think. Let America make its own mind up.
@chaddukes Junks should get you on for the Masters. Epic radio. Can't wait for your hot take on Mickelson's driving.
@CBSNews He‚Äôs got them crazy eyes. üëÄ
@CNNPolitics Good lord. This is a disaster. If Dems aren‚Äôt willing to budge, this shutdown will last months.
@realDonaldTrump POTUS, come down from $5.6B. Dems, come up from $1.6B. This is not difficult once you put aside politics. Meet in the middle and let‚Äôs get fed employees back to work with a paycheck.
@DeborahDitkows1 @Coryw74 @CBSNews @FrancoOrdonez And what of it? None of what you said takes him out of the Oval Office or removes his power. Please, live in reality. He‚Äôs the POTUS. Pretending otherwise is ignorant. I didn‚Äôt vote for him, but he‚Äôs there, and if you cannot accept that, your voice isn‚Äôt relevant.
@DeborahDitkows1 @Coryw74 @CBSNews @FrancoOrdonez You can either keep shouting your stats and be ignored or you can accept the fact a wall is popular with a lot of your fellow Americans and negotiate on that basis. A ‚Äúno wall‚Äù stance is, put simply, a nonstarter. Shutdown will continue until that stance changes.
@DeborahDitkows1 @Coryw74 @CBSNews @FrancoOrdonez Good lord. This isn‚Äôt about being right or wrong. Politics rarely is. It‚Äôs about the people &amp; what they think. The wall is very popular in many parts of America, and your data is not going to make a lick of difference to them. Maybe you‚Äôve noticed, no one‚Äôs changing their mind.
@DeborahDitkows1 @Coryw74 @CBSNews @FrancoOrdonez I think that‚Äôs what folks are missing. A good chunk of the country is pro-wall. It‚Äôs not some wacky idea no one supports. If you‚Äôre treating it like it is, you don‚Äôt understand America in 2019. Whether or not you agree, it has a lot of support.
@DeborahDitkows1 @Coryw74 @CBSNews @FrancoOrdonez I know folks from Iowa and I disagree completely. Iowa is a red state now. A decade or two it wasn‚Äôt. The heartland loves the wall. You can disagree, but reality is, it‚Äôs no longer close to a tossup state. By the way, I love Iowa.
@DeborahDitkows1 @Coryw74 @CBSNews @FrancoOrdonez It‚Äôs also completely over emotional. We already have wall/slats/fencing/etc on 30-50% of the border. Clearly previous administrations (GOP and Dem) saw value in it. Most Americans can‚Äôt see past Trump and realize this is not a partisan issue.
@DeborahDitkows1 @Coryw74 @CBSNews @FrancoOrdonez What constitutes ‚Äúcaring‚Äù is not the same in Iowa as it is in California. To Iowa, caring about America is a secure border. California disagrees (at least to the extent it involves a wall). You must know how polarized the country is. Shouldn‚Äôt be a shock we don‚Äôt agree here.
@Coryw74 @DeborahDitkows1 @CBSNews @FrancoOrdonez Sure, theoretically it could happen. In reality, aside from some moderate R‚Äôs - Murkowski, Collins, etc - you‚Äôre not going to flip anyone else. It would be politically insane since most of their constituents support their stance on immigration.
@Coryw74 @DeborahDitkows1 @CBSNews @FrancoOrdonez Mitch McConnell has already said they‚Äôre not going to bring up a bill unless the POTUS supports it.  The GOP has a majority in the Senate. There is simply no way they‚Äôre going to have enough votes to override. It would take all Dems plus, what, 16-something R‚Äôs? Not happening.
@lisashaheen1 @SandyBatt1 @VP @POTUS @SenSchumer Wow. I feel sorry for the hundreds of thousands of federal employees who are going to go months without pay. Clearly you don‚Äôt.
@MeliaWilkinson @RedeemedofHim @VP @POTUS @SenSchumer The deal was between the parties in the Senate, not the POTUS. As long as POTUS has veto power, there‚Äôs not really a deal. Separation of powers.
@Coryw74 @DeborahDitkows1 @CBSNews @FrancoOrdonez What is this, "so you're saying there's a chance"? Hey, I pay my $5 for the Powerball, there's a chance I'll win. The odds are very, very bad, however. Hoping for a miracle is not a great way to go through life. Much smarter to cede to reality. It's what adults do.
@Coryw74 @DeborahDitkows1 @CBSNews @FrancoOrdonez And that just ain't happenin. This is a signature thing for the POTUS. I guarantee you he'll let gov't stay shut down for months to get it. So if no wall is more important than stopping the shutdown, fine, but understand you can't have both. Live in reality on reality's terms.
@Coryw74 @DeborahDitkows1 @CBSNews @FrancoOrdonez Then prepare for hundreds of thousands of fed workers to go months without pay. If that's your position - no compromise - I guarantee you this will be by far the longest shutdown on record. If you're OK with that, fine. Somehow I feel you think you can get no wall and no shutdown
@BoredLosing @CBSNews Seriously, this is a very easy issue to resolve. Draw a line in the middle of the two numbers, negotiate hard, but find an agreement. This happens millions of times a day in the business world. It simply is not hard to negotiate, so long as both parties are willing.
@BoredLosing @CBSNews He's crazy and mercurial. Every person on Earth knows that. If it's not $2.5B, what is it? Get in a room and meet somewhere in the middle. It's not rocket science. What's your best argument against that? Why not figure out a number somewhere between $1.6B and $5.6B and move on?
@SusanLetournea6 @VP @POTUS @SenSchumer ... and threatened to use the veto power given to him by the Constitution. Hate Trump all you want. I'm not a fan. But you calling him names does absolutely nothing to resolve this situation. If you want Dems not to budge, this shutdown will be months and months long.
@BoredLosing @CBSNews What I read is that Dems insisted on $1.6B for the wall, which was their initial position. If Dems agreed on $2.6B for the wall, then I was wrong. I don't think I was. I'm pretty confident Schumer/Pelosi didn't budge from $1.6B. I'd love to be proven wrong.
@DeborahDitkows1 @Coryw74 @CBSNews @FrancoOrdonez None of that has any relation to the government shutdown. Feel free to live in your alternate reality if you want, but if you want to discuss reality, you need to live in it. He's the POTUS and he has the powers of that office. Either square with reality or shut up.
@Coryw74 @DeborahDitkows1 @CBSNews @FrancoOrdonez The GOP has a majority in the Senate, which basically says half of the country supports them. Dems getting the house is meaningless in this particular issue. POTUS has veto power and we all know he'll use it. You're not a smart person if you can't see that.
@SandyBatt1 @lisashaheen1 @VP @POTUS @SenSchumer Yep. I voted for her, not him. I'm a rational adult. I am absolutely fine with my Senators (Dems, by the way) meeting POTUS in the middle on the dollar amount. Your move. Should Dems stay at $1.6B no matter how long the shutdown goes?
@DeborahDitkows1 @Coryw74 @CBSNews @FrancoOrdonez Yes - and maybe you're not aware of this, but half of the states are supportive of the POTUS. Those constituents aren't saying "give in". And whether Trump hears Fox News simply isn't relevant. He's the POTUS. That you dislike him doesn't magically make his powers go away.
@BoredLosing @CBSNews It's not a compromise until the POTUS agrees to it. Period. By the way, I didn't vote for Trump. I don't like him. This is where we're at: Dems are refusing to budge from $1.6B, and if they don't, the shutdown will continue endlessly. Is "stopping the wall" worth that?
@beckoh @CBSNews @FrancoOrdonez Are you high? If you've been alive over the past year, you must know how bitterly divided the Senate is. What on Earth makes you think the Senate can come anywhere close to the two-thirds majority needed to override his veto? It's not happening.
@Coryw74 @CBSNews @FrancoOrdonez With a two-thirds majority, which is not going to happen. Practically speaking, on this particular issue, his veto power is extremely powerful. There's zero chance the Senate can agree on something that will achieve two thirds support.
@lisashaheen1 @VP @POTUS @SenSchumer So you're OK with the shutdown lasting a year to stop the wall, understanding that it will cause enormous financial hardship for hundreds of thousands of federal employees?
@BoredLosing @CBSNews Which is a right given to him by the Constitution. It's not a compromise if it doesn't involve the POTUS, period, and to say otherwise is to show a sad lack of knowledge about how our country works.
@CBSNews @FrancoOrdonez He has veto power. That's a fairly powerful form of leverage.
@masterstips @VP @POTUS @SenSchumer Wow, you're right. Moving from $1.6B to $1.6B is negotiating. Thanks for enlightening us with your clear-eyed understanding of how negotiating works. I always thought it involved giving up something you want to get something from the other party. Thanks, dullard!
@lisashaheen1 @VP @POTUS @SenSchumer Why is money needed to build a wall? I think you can probably answer that question yourself. Walls cost money. He wants a wall. Therefore he needs money for it. Not very complex, is it?
@masterstips @VP @POTUS @SenSchumer Pence went to Dems with an offer of $2.5B for "the wall" and the rest for other border security. Dems rejected it and insisted on $1.6B. POTUS came down from $5.6 to $2.5B. Dems refused to budge above $1.6B, which is what you call "refusing to compromise".
@Cinmabar @VP @POTUS Thanks for contributing nothing. While you bloviate, fed workers aren't getting paid. This isn't about the wall. This is about being adults and making a deal so they can get paid. Anything beyond that is political nonsense.
@KarlShipps @VP @POTUS @SenSchumer They did offer something up - $2.5B for the wall. If Dems are going to stick to "no wall", the shutdown's on them. Both sides have to be willing to give to get. If Dems are saying they won't budge, the shutdown will continue for months.
@masterstips @VP @POTUS @SenSchumer That's not how a compromise works. Both sides have to give to get. If you care about getting gov't workers back to work, stop with the nonsense "we're not going to give an inch", work out a deal, and get them paid. If Dems aren't willing to compromise, nothing will happen.
@MeliaWilkinson @VP @POTUS @SenSchumer The emergency is the federal workers not getting paid.
@VP @POTUS @SenSchumer Conversely, if it's more important to say "we stopped the wall" rather than get gov't employees back to work, by all means continue to make no effort toward compromise and instead continue holding press conferences blaming everyone else for the shutdown.
@VP @POTUS @SenSchumer Look, I'm no fan of the POTUS, but in this case at least he's made some effort toward compromise. There's ZERO compromise on the Dem side. That's not how deals work. If you actually care about ending the shutdown, make a deal and stop grandstanding for 2020.
@CBSNews So naturally the two sides worked out a compromise, right? Because everyone wants the gov't to re-open and compromise is the only way that happens.
@CBSNews Well, that's a fairly ridiculous question. Neither side is pro-shutdown.
@wolfblitzer @realDonaldTrump @CNNSitRoom Fingers crossed for some news of a compromise.
@espn @AdamSchefter Consider giving here -&gt; https://t.co/QUIhOAQbQJ - dollar for dollar matching from the Walther Cancer Foundation
@darrenrovell Can we please just take the 2022 WC from Qatar and put it anywhere that makes sense?
@ryandaytime @AlbertBreer The B2 is amazing.
@notthefakeSVP Y‚Äôall - if you‚Äôd like to give to Purdue‚Äôs Tyler Trent research fund - https://t.co/QUIhOAQbQJ - consider donating. Seems like a good cause and a good way to show you care.
@darrenrovell If anyone cares to donate to Purdue‚Äôs fund for cancer research - https://t.co/QUIhOAQbQJ - seems like a good cause to donate in his name.
@MrChickSports If y‚Äôall want, you can donate to the cause: https://t.co/QUIhOAQbQJ - tweeted to me by Purdue. I gave $20. I believe they‚Äôll use the money wisely to keep searching for a cure.
@PUCancerCenter @theTylerTrent Gave $20. I encourage everyone who reads this to give whatever they can. The cause couldn‚Äôt be better.
@MtCowboyWy @john_keim We love him in DC.
@PUCancerCenter @theTylerTrent Keep on fighting for a cure. That‚Äôs what Tyler would want. Someday maybe it will happen.
@lizdrabick This seems like a solid decision.
@richeisen @cbfowler @espn @rosebowlgame That was a fantastic picture.

@DhaSickest He didn‚Äôt miss leg day.
@drabtshirt @Crigger37 @jimjester @BigOandDukes @chaddukes @oscarradio Amazing episode y‚Äôall.
@TeamGleason You‚Äôre incredible, sir. Blessings to you and your family in 2019.
@USNA86 B2 flyover ain‚Äôt bad neither.
@CBSNews Please make a deal. Fed employees shouldn‚Äôt suffer over politics.
@Lj_era8 I love it, man. God bless you in 2019 and beyond.
@JamesNiehues Can‚Äôt wait to see the book. Congrats!
@realDonaldTrump Make a deal. Please. Compromise, y‚Äôall!
@BigOandDukes I saw this 6 mins before show time. 2019 is already amazing.
@RossTuckerNFL I think a good rule would be that you‚Äôve played 2 full years. Start as a true freshman? Leave after 2 years. Redshirt as a freshman? Leave after 3 years. 2 full years of CFB is more than enough prep time.
@EdTownshend @BigOandDukes @chaddukes @drabtshirt @oscarradio Are you on a set from Mad Men? Good lord.
@DuleHill @PattyArquette Please. We all know @JazmynSimon runs the house. :)
@tracywolfson Great crew. Have a blessed 2019!
@chaddukes Christ.

@wojespn @theTylerTrent This is why we fight.
@chaddukes @millerhighlife I really wanted one of those High Life bottles. ‚ÄúJelly‚Äù as @drabtshirt would say. Happy 2019 Shooter.
@ScottNNJ @PoRiverJamBand @izofella06 @WSJ You as well.
@ScottNNJ @PoRiverJamBand @izofella06 @WSJ Thanks for sharing. Clearly there is a problem. I guess I just don‚Äôt want to resort to ‚Äúbig pharma profiteering‚Äù as the default answer. I think it‚Äôs more nuanced. That said, of course I would like to see people live their best lives. We can agree on that.
@AussieAA I get it. This just smacks to me of the EpiPen debacle, where it turned out there were cheaper alternatives available if people just knew about them. I don‚Äôt think radical changes are needed - a few tweaks here and there and problem solved. But, perhaps I‚Äôm being pollyannaish,
@PoRiverJamBand @izofella06 @WSJ I don‚Äôt know how to respond other than to say have a blessed 2019.
@izofella06 @PoRiverJamBand @WSJ I get it. One of my best friends growing up was type 1. Daily injections.
@izofella06 @PoRiverJamBand @WSJ Because, do we have this problem elsewhere? Not really. People are perfectly capable of making decisions about what‚Äôs worth spending money on, so long as they can understand costs and benefits. There just isn‚Äôt any way to know what anyone‚Äôs really paying.
@izofella06 @PoRiverJamBand @WSJ The other huge problem is that pharma might be the least transparent market in the US. When you account for insurance, discounts, etc no one has any idea what they‚Äôre actually paying. It‚Äôd be nice if consumers could have some idea of what they‚Äôre actually paying.
@izofella06 @PoRiverJamBand @WSJ That‚Äôs kinda what I was saying. You can have cheaper, less effective insulin or expensive, more effective insulin. I know everyone would like cheaper, more effective insulin but that‚Äôs the rub, and in the US, most people lean toward the most effective treatment.
@alblemma @AussieAA @WSJ Such is the cost of subsidizing innovation for the rest of the world. I kid, I kid - I know that‚Äôs not completely true. Still, there‚Äôs an argument to be made there.
@PoRiverJamBand @WSJ That‚Äôs not 100% true. Consumers tend to also want the best meds. If there‚Äôs consumer demand for other options, it‚Äôll happen. All it takes is for people to buy less effective but cheaper insulin.
@AussieAA @WSJ Not that simple. Americans tend to want the best meds. The best meds cost more. If you want cheaper insulin that‚Äôs less effective, we can make that happen. All it takes is the marketplace demanding it.
@spark_polliwog_ @WSJ @maggieNYT Basically, pharma companies tend to product the latest and greatest insulin rather than the cheapest. Profit margin on ‚Äúold insulin‚Äù isn‚Äôt as good. It‚Äôs really not that complex. If someone makes and sells ‚Äúold insulin‚Äù, problem solved.
@WSJ It‚Äôs not that complex. Older forms of insulin - those derived from animals rather than synthesized - are cheaper. Also, the FDA can act to make biosimilar insulin available. Tell your elected representatives you want these things to happen. Not rocket science.
@WestrayKnight @bellyakim @BuckyBrooks Yeah, I know. My point is my team sucks and enjoy what you have. Have a great 2019 man.
@chorizoandbeer @EamesEra @KenTremendous I don‚Äôt know nothing, man. Have a blessed 2019.
@SunnyLedfurd And a wood-burning stove. Brother, I can get there in a few hours if you give me the address. Looks amazing.
@darrenrovell Betting is for degenerates. Use your money on something rather than throwing it away on this nonsense.
@NFLOfficiating @NFL I really like Walt Anderson.
@TBrownYahoo @JeffPassan Nice.
@Reuters Gross.
@WestrayKnight @bellyakim @BuckyBrooks Bro, I‚Äôm a Redskins fan. Let me be. :-)
@DhaSickest Fresh and clean. Stay safe out there my man.
@EamesEra @KenTremendous I was being a bit hyperbolic. What I mean is: there‚Äôs a clear ‚Äúhey man, you shouldn‚Äôt be saying that‚Äù coming from a lot of people. That‚Äôs disappointing. Let bad fail on its own.
@TimCField @KenTremendous I LOL‚Äôd. :-)
@WestrayKnight @bellyakim @BuckyBrooks It‚Äôs a QB league, and the only proof you need is Baker Mayfield. No other position can make such a dramatic impact. Ben is the straw that stirs the drink, period, and you‚Äôre not living in reality if you think otherwise. He‚Äôs the franchise until he retires.
@KenTremendous But shouldn‚Äôt comedians be free to fail? It worries me so many people are endorsing the ‚Äúsilence him‚Äù angle rather than the ‚Äúit‚Äôs bad and it will fail and let‚Äôs let it‚Äù angle. Quality will out. Bad schtick will fail. Comedic Darwinism.
@bellyakim @WestrayKnight @BuckyBrooks I‚Äôm not going to respond until you can capitalize properly.
@MrChickSports @ByMikeJones I agree with y‚Äôall, but also, it‚Äôs so hard to find a refuge from politics these days. To me that‚Äôs what sport should be - something to enjoy. Not saying stick to sports, say what you will, but sometimes it‚Äôs nice to have a place to just enjoy competition without the baggage.
@X1000D @WSJ This. The purpose of a meeting is to get shit done, not to blow hot air. If people in your meeting are tuning you out, YOU are the problem. No one tunes out on a compelling speaker. Do better.
@CBSNews And this is coming from a man who‚Äôs voted for a Republican once in my lifetime. I dislike Trump, but this is not the time to stake out turf for 2020. Fed employees are the ones being hurt. It‚Äôs time to make nice and find a mutually acceptable solution.
@CBSNews This is a disingenuous headline. If Dems wanted to re-open gov‚Äôt, they‚Äôd work on a compromise solution. Instead, they want to grandstand for 2020. Pelosi/Schumer want to position the party as never giving in to the wall, damn the torpedoes.
@WestrayKnight @bellyakim @BuckyBrooks Look, OP‚Äôs point was Ben‚Äôs the problem. He‚Äôs not the one testing positive. He‚Äôs not the one sitting out the year. He‚Äôs not the one throwing tantrums. He‚Äôs the guy who‚Äôs always on the field. Put simply, he is not the problem.
@jcalvinmeyer Is this from his @GameOfThrones audition?
@bellyakim @BuckyBrooks Fine. Then how about he‚Äôs a no doubt Hall of Famer? How about the fact that guys like Martavis Bryant bad Le‚Äôveon Bell are proven to be easily replaceable by draft picks like Smith-Schuster and Conner? But hey, I‚Äôm sure Ben‚Äôs the problem.
@PrestonSmith94 Super cute. Congrats!
@bellyakim @BuckyBrooks He also led the league in passing yards. This is a somewhat important stat.
@BuckyBrooks Maybe Ben just has high expectations of his teammates and coaches and some of them just can‚Äôt perform up to those expectations.
@Clumsy_Beast @thetruesavage @ABC And eventually, Dems will give him about $2.5B for "border security" without a wall, they'll claim they won, Trump will say he got his wall, and both sides claim a pyrrhic victory. That's my prediction. Would love to hear yours: when will POTUS cave? One week? Two weeks?
@Clumsy_Beast @thetruesavage @ABC Hey, maybe you're right. Time will tell. Let's revisit this in a week or two and see where it ends up. For my money: Trump will cave on the dollar amount but not the "wall" overall, Dems will refuse to give him a penny more, and in two weeks the shutdown is still going on.
@Clumsy_Beast @thetruesavage @ABC And that's the difference you can't see. It's a game of chicken. Trump is perfectly willing to drive his car into yours. He's crazy. Dems aren't, and no matter how long it goes, all that matters is who flinches first. I see no reason it will be POTUS.
@Clumsy_Beast @thetruesavage @ABC For Christ's sake, as you pointed out, he's declared bankruptcy many times. Doesn't this suggest he's perfectly willing to let the ship go down? Do you think he cares one whit for federal workers that aren't getting paid? Of course not. He's a machine. He has no sympathy.
@Clumsy_Beast @thetruesavage @ABC And goodness, from a PR standpoint, he's the one who stayed in DC and the Dems are saying we'll never give him his wall. The American people aren't smart, but when one side says we're never going to cave, it makes it very easy for the other side to blame them.
@Clumsy_Beast @thetruesavage @ABC You're approaching this as if he's a standard POTUS, which couldn't be farther from the truth. He's a madman. Wouldn't you agree? Then throw out the playbook. You cannot apply standard logic to him. He's a unicorn in terms of a POTUS.
@Clumsy_Beast @thetruesavage @ABC You think he cares about the government being open? Or the stock market? And he never wanted this job. I guarantee you he did it for publicity, not thinking he'd actually win. You don't understand him. Again, I don't like him, but I can square with reality and understand him.
@Clumsy_Beast @thetruesavage @ABC I get it: you don't like him. Neither do I. But I can separate my emotions from logic. What does he get from caving on his wall? You still haven't given a good reason. You keep attacking him, and that's fine, but if you can't give me a good reason for him to cave, I win.
@Clumsy_Beast @thetruesavage @ABC Leave your personal feelings aside. I know this is some sort of way for you to vent, but if you can, please set aside your emotions and give me one solid reason to think Trump will cave on the wall, which is basically the #1 signature promise of his campaign.
@Clumsy_Beast @thetruesavage @ABC Again - give me one good reason Trump will cave on his wall. Why would he do it? Give me a rationale explanation of why it makes sense for him to cave. I don't think you can. I think he'd be happy to let the shutdown go on for two years.
@AndyBitterVT That's a legit complaint. It seems like the refs are calling it when they decide it's a pick play, not based on what's actually happening.
@Clumsy_Beast @thetruesavage @ABC And by the way, your examples are awful. When did he back down on NK? When was he soft on China? What on earth do bankruptcies and porn star payments have to do with backing down? You've cited a list of things that have zero relation to my tweet. Live in reality.
@Clumsy_Beast @thetruesavage @ABC Give me one good reason you think he's going to cave on the wall (or, the slats, border security, whatever you want to call it). There isn't one. Half of the country hates him, half loves him, and no one's changing their mind. He would gain absolutely nothing from caving.
@thetruesavage @ABC Both sides have to compromise to get something done. WH has at least floated a compromise via Pence. Dems are essentially saying they won't compromise. That means the shutdown will last a while. POTUS is not known for backing down on an issue like this.
@thetruesavage @ABC And then what? They're going to advance the same bill Trump is refusing to sign. It won't go forward and the shutdown will continue. Dems aren't gaining any meaningful power on 1/3. POTUS can and will veto it.
@TomPelissero Every team with a young QB is going to want him. Desperate for the next Sean McVay/QB whisperer.
@AndyBitterVT You have 1) pointing 2) taunting 3) inciting 4) celebration 5) diving into the end zone 6) removing helmet 7) gestures 8) entering the stands 9) late hit 10) pulling off the pile. Not that hard to tell us which one was called.
@AndyBitterVT Why aren't referees required to announce the specific clause of the penalty being called? As-is, we have no idea what type of unsportsmanlike conduct it was and therefore no way to judge whether it was accurately called.
@xOGCamox @FieldYates Yes - durability concerns arising from his major knee injury. I wasn't wrong, but thanks for contributing.
@FieldYates Remember when Jack dropped way down in the draft due to durability concerns? I guess they've been answered.
@RedTail_Nupe @iam_sdh20 I think SDH has a great chance to make a big leap forward in 2019. Would love to see the @Redskins draft S @playmaker_11 and move us further toward an an Bama defense.
@ByMikeJones Also, the lack of black QBs in the past has a ripple effect. QBs make great head coaches. More black QBs should mean more black HCs. Once they're done playing, guys like @dak @PatrickMahomes5 @deshaunwatson @Jaboowins @Lj_era8 will be able to get there.
@ByMikeJones I think it's the offensive trend. Every franchise is chasing the next Sean McVay. I expect Eric Bienemy to be in demand for that reason. Vance Joseph and Steve Wilks are becoming available at a time when defensive HCs are devalued.
@wingoz @ChicagoBears @RamsNFL Counterpoint: @ChicagoBears and @RamsNFL have cheap QBs on rookie deals. Much harder to sign an elite defensive player when you eventually have to pay market rate for your QB.
@Redskins Opponent #1: Bruce Allen. #FireBruceAllen
@czabe This. Every team has injuries. Skins problem for years has been not accumulating talent in the draft. They've finally learned their lesson and have started to get young talent in the lower rounds. They need to keep doing that. Should be able to win through most injuries.
@ByMikeJones I think the good news is that teams are going to be more open to younger hires with less experience, which is good for minority head coaches who might not have that experience. At worst, maybe it's a chance for good young minority positional coaches to move to coordinators.
@DC_vetadvocate @granthpaulsen Then extend Jay another year. Look, you have to live in reality. No one wants the HC job. Jay's doing OK. Let him manage the team and bring in a bright young offensive mind to call plays.
@AlbertBreer Here's a wacky idea: Kellen Moore, QBs coach, DAL. That guy carved up the NCAA with a noodle arm. I think he's a brilliant offensive mind, he's young, he was a leader as a player, and he'd be great to mentor a young QB. Surround him with experienced coordinators and who knows.
@granthpaulsen This is 100% accurate. However, I think perhaps they should be looking for a new OC. Defense was respectable in 2018. Offense, not so much. Get a new OC, figure out the QB position, grab some playmakers in the draft, and if you squint your eyes maybe this is a playoff team.
@RapSheet @TomPelissero Picking from the discards is generally not a great strategy.
@RapSheet Cards? They need a HC to mentor Rosen.
@BuckyBrooks I think he‚Äôs mostly a victim of the Cards drafting Rosen. Thought when hiring Wilks was get Bradford and win with a strong D. Now, Cards want an offensive HC to mentor Rosen. You can‚Äôt foresee everything.
@michaelpRTD #tank4tua
@EBJunkies I don‚Äôt care if they go 0-16 so long as they get Bruce away from the football side and promote Schaffer to run the football side. At least then we can have a tiny bit of hope. As long as Bruce is here, it‚Äôs going to be a dumpster fire.
@AlGaldi I‚Äôd be happy if they moved Bruce to the biz side and promoted Schaffer to head football ops. That‚Äôs the fundamental change we need.
@MarkMaske @dcsportsbog Would be a smart move, which probably means it won‚Äôt happen. Schaffer is the most respected guy in the front office from the perspective of other teams, AFAIK.
@chaddukes We need Turn In Your Keycards Part 2 tomorrow. Good lord. What a debacle...
@Redskins F**k you. Turn in your keycard, whoever is tweeting this. Find a job with a shred of dignity.
@Redskins Have the common decency to stop tweeting. This is a complete dumpster fire. They‚Äôre making the Wizards look like a well-run organization.
@michaelpRTD Find those men and beat them with a sock filled with nickels.
@GlassJoeJP I‚Äôd like to think this is rock bottom but with this team, they‚Äôll just take that as a challenge.
@BurgundyBlog Blow out everyone. Snyder, sell the team. The NFL doesn‚Äôt suit you. #FireBruceAllen.
@Redskins I could go on but you ge the idea. What a collection of assholes we have running the ship in Ashburn.
@Redskins Play a game in a meaningful NFL game in week 17
@Redskins Play for a winning team
@Redskins #FireBruceAllen
@JuddApatow Because they‚Äôre really biting their tongues now?

@AndrewBrandt And then the sports wasteland....
@BigChuck9 @darrenrovell @iriworldwide You are a right thinking American, sir.
@darrenrovell @iriworldwide Busch Light is amazing. Any domestic light beer that comes in a 30 pack is alright by me.
@TomFornelli @BodeUF I love how it‚Äôs perfectly OK for these men to beat the shit out of each other but somehow we have to protect their feelings against taunting as if they‚Äôre five year olds. Sportsmanship should be taught by parents and coaches, not the TV.
@CorgisforLove @Falcone234 @thrillmaster89 @GustavMahlerJr @Ocasio2018 Let‚Äôs stop arguing and start talking about how super-cute corgis are.
@CorgisforLove @Falcone234 @thrillmaster89 @GustavMahlerJr @Ocasio2018 But that‚Äôs not really true. The ultra-wealthy pay most of the taxes. The dem narrative that the rich magically avoid taxes simply isn‚Äôt so. The wealthy ought to pay for what they get. When it comes to ‚Äútake their money because they have too much‚Äù, that‚Äôs where we part ways.
@CorgisforLove @Falcone234 @thrillmaster89 @GustavMahlerJr @Ocasio2018 Problem there is defining rich. I live in the DC area. Real estate is super expensive. You can make $250k and be living OK, but nothing fancy, whereas 250k in other places is a fortune. Often $250k is ‚Äúthe rich‚Äù. If they‚Äôre in a pricey area, that‚Äôs not true.
@Telluride Be there Jan 26th. Pls keep conditions nice. Thx!
@CorgisforLove @Falcone234 @thrillmaster89 @GustavMahlerJr @Ocasio2018 ... but recall the words of JFK: Ask not what your country can do. Ask what you can do for your country. Lots of people asking for things from their country. Too few contributing to the solution.
@CorgisforLove @Falcone234 @thrillmaster89 @GustavMahlerJr @Ocasio2018 Both of my parents worked hard all their lives to give my brother and I the best life possible. When I look at society, I see a lack of that. I see families not together, not supporting each other, etc. I don‚Äôt think government can correct that. I don‚Äôt want to get carried away
@CorgisforLove @Falcone234 @thrillmaster89 @GustavMahlerJr @Ocasio2018 My parents came from a very middle class family in Roanoke, VA. Grandpa sold insurance. Dad worked for gov‚Äôt. Mom was a nurse. Did I have help? Obviously. That‚Äôs what‚Äôs supposed to happen. Parents are supposed to raise children to do well. Family, not government, is the key.
@Falcone234 @APERSON81543950 @Simmonds91R @thrillmaster89 @GustavMahlerJr @Ocasio2018 I get it. I just think we make too much hay of that stuff. Can‚Äôt afford 4Y? Do 2Y in community college. Too much complaining, too little making ends meet. I‚Äôd like more work on solutions and less idle complaining.
@Ottauquechee @devreal @Ocasio2018 Also, I‚Äôve voted Democratic almost 100% of the time. I voted for one GOP fellow who‚Äôs done well for us locally. It just worries me that there‚Äôs such a violent course correction in the Trump era. We need not go crazy. Stay the course and we‚Äôll be OK.
@Ottauquechee @devreal @Ocasio2018 I know. I was being bombastic. Those are all reasonable things. They just need a little tweaking from time to time. Example: people are living longer, therefore we need to push the SS eligibility age back a few years. I think it would behoove us to nudge things little by little.
@RnOwner @GustavMahlerJr @Ocasio2018 I‚Äôm strumming Kumbaya on my acoustic guitar right now. I just hope John Belushi doesn‚Äôt descend from heaven and smash it right in front of me.
@Ottauquechee @devreal @Ocasio2018 Agreed. Hey, I like ACO. She‚Äôs got a lot of energy. I wish her well. I do think it would serve her well to focus on the job at hand rather than sick burns on Twitter. Get in there and get shit done. Talking/tweeting does nothing.
@AndersonJG @thrillmaster89 @GustavMahlerJr @Ocasio2018 Of course. Candidly, I think if you get the right decision makers, most any system can be made to work. Perhaps my quarrel is more with people who want to paint the US as a dumpster fire. I‚Äôve been to a lot of places in the country this year. They mostly seem OK.
@AndersonJG @thrillmaster89 @GustavMahlerJr @Ocasio2018 What I get from that is that we‚Äôre not terribly dissimilar. Seriously: why do we spend so much time focusing on what‚Äôs different rather than what‚Äôs the same? Canada‚Äôs fine. We‚Äôre fine. Why are we so desperate to find a schism to hammer away at?
@AndersonJG @thrillmaster89 @GustavMahlerJr @Ocasio2018 Every once in a while I think: why don‚Äôt Canada and the US merge and form The Greatest Country Ever? We‚Äôre so much alike. Quibbles aside, can you imagine how powerful and amazing that country would be? I love Canada. I love the US. Together we‚Äôd be unstoppable.
@AndersonJG @thrillmaster89 @GustavMahlerJr @Ocasio2018 Economics at the country scale are simply too complex to be expressed on Twitter. Canada‚Äôs great. The US is great. We‚Äôre brothers that sometimes quarrel. Candidly, if you squint your eyes, there‚Äôs really not too much difference.
@Falcone234 @APERSON81543950 @Simmonds91R @thrillmaster89 @GustavMahlerJr @Ocasio2018 But I think life is on the whole fairly good for most Americans. I don‚Äôt understand the apocalyptic narrative being spewed by so many. I fear Russia‚Äôs been all too successful in its attempts to make us fight each other rather than them.
@Falcone234 @APERSON81543950 @Simmonds91R @thrillmaster89 @GustavMahlerJr @Ocasio2018 Reasonable. I guess I just think today‚Äôs middle class is OK. You can fly cross-country for $300. You can get a 70‚Äù TV for under $1,000. You can get an utterly amazing phone for $50 a month.I don‚Äôt think we give ourselves enough credit. Are we perfect? Of course not.
@Draper185 @thrillmaster89 @GustavMahlerJr @Ocasio2018 That diversity is good in a lot of ways. It just makes it more difficult to achieve consensus on the running of the country. California and Wyoming couldn‚Äôt be more different. Somehow we have to figure out how to make them get along. Not easy.
@Draper185 @thrillmaster89 @GustavMahlerJr @Ocasio2018 People try to convince me those countries are diverse. I don‚Äôt buy it. There are parts of this country that might as well be Mexico or China. I don‚Äôt see that in Nordic countries. I see a lot of white folks who practice a similar religion.
@Draper185 @thrillmaster89 @GustavMahlerJr @Ocasio2018 Toss in a big chunk of the population that was taken from Africa and enslaved. Add in a dash of Hispanic migration. Stir in a massive, continent sized country and I think you have something that is wholly unlike those countries. I submit to you that comparison is apples/oranges.
@Falcone234 @thrillmaster89 @GustavMahlerJr @Ocasio2018 I‚Äôm good with safety nets. That‚Äôs not what I‚Äôm hearing from ACO. I hear her espousing more of a government‚Äôs going to run most of your life theme. Perhaps I‚Äôm wrong. Time will tell.
@Falcone234 @thrillmaster89 @GustavMahlerJr @Ocasio2018 Perhaps, but her policies would represent major changes to the country. Also, recall that until LBJ‚Äôs Great Society, those social safety nets mostly didn‚Äôt exist. You can argue that the best US - the one that saved the world twice - was the one before the Great Society, not after
@RnOwner @GustavMahlerJr @Ocasio2018 Agreed, but it happens. There are houses of people in Appalachia that are dependent on gov‚Äôt checks, due in part to the opioid crisis and the general economy in those states, and I fear that‚Äôs not great for them. I don‚Äôt think you‚Äôre on the dole is the best outcome we can achieve
@RnOwner @GustavMahlerJr @Ocasio2018 Then I think we agree. A safety net is good. All I want is some mechanism to ensure the money‚Äôs achieving a result. Working, getting training, etc -as long as you‚Äôre moving forward. If someone‚Äôs a complete no-count, then I think you get cut off eventually.
@Ottauquechee @devreal @Ocasio2018 I‚Äôm actually very socially liberal. I‚Äôm 100% for LGBTQ rights, marijuana legalization, abortion rights, etc. I just lean fiscally conservative, meaning I have no party. GOP is full of religious nonsense and Dem wants to give everyone everything for free.
@RealKokoPuffs @thrillmaster89 @GustavMahlerJr @Ocasio2018 I really dislike people comparing those countries to the US. They don‚Äôt have a big population whose ancestors were brought over as slaves. They don‚Äôt have significant Latino populations. And so on. I think it‚Äôs apples and oranges.
@Ottauquechee @devreal @Ocasio2018 Hey, I have a degree in interdisciplinary studies, which is a nonsense degree. Maybe it‚Äôs not based on field, but on progress, or something. I just don‚Äôt want to be subsidizing someone who‚Äôs just going through the motions.
@TheLaziestBee @KateKarwowska @LegendaryEnergy @Ocasio2018 No doubt an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure, as the saying goes. Health policy ought to encourage that. On the other hand, at some point the baby bird‚Äôs got to fly from the nest. You shouldn‚Äôt get free stuff if you‚Äôre not contributing anything to society,.
@CBSEveningNews @CBSNews @JBsportscaster RIP, sir. Any man who espouses whiskey and cigars as the secret to a long life is a fine American.
@Falcone234 @thrillmaster89 @GustavMahlerJr @Ocasio2018 I get your point. I just don‚Äôt think we need massive changes. I think we can tweak here and there and make things work better without going full-on socialism. I love ACO‚Äôs energy. I just wish going hard left wasn‚Äôt the cause du jour for Dems.
@danloughmiller @thrillmaster89 @GustavMahlerJr @Ocasio2018 That‚Äôs a number I found with some quick searching. Let‚Äôs not get lost in the numbers. ACO‚Äôs proposals would significantly increase our taxes. Maybe you want to give the government more money. I don‚Äôt.
@danloughmiller @thrillmaster89 @GustavMahlerJr @Ocasio2018 That‚Äôs what irks me about where the Dem party is. We seem to want to strum Kumbaya and think everyone‚Äôs equal. They aren‚Äôt. If you can fly a plane or transplant a heart, you‚Äôre more valuable and I have no problem with you getting better care as a result.
@danloughmiller @thrillmaster89 @GustavMahlerJr @Ocasio2018 I have great healthcare because I work for a great organization that values what I do. I don‚Äôt feel bad that someone flipping burgers gets lesser care. I‚Äôm fine with a safety net. I don‚Äôt like the idea that everyone gets treated the same.
@thrillmaster89 @GustavMahlerJr @Ocasio2018 It doesn‚Äôt make the point moot. Massive tax increases would be required to fund ACO‚Äôs policies. That‚Äôs the point, not the exact number. I‚Äôm not wealthy but I get by. I already pay a fair amount in taxes and I‚Äôm not thrilled with the idea of that going way up.
@RealKokoPuffs @thrillmaster89 @GustavMahlerJr @Ocasio2018 Hey, thanks for the condescension. Those are numbers I found with some quick searching. Point is, if we implement ACO‚Äôs policies, taxes are going to be really high. No other way to pay for it.
@Falcone234 @Simmonds91R @thrillmaster89 @GustavMahlerJr @Ocasio2018 That model can work, obviously. Just think we need to be smart about it. If we‚Äôre investing in people in a way that pays off, I like it. If we‚Äôre churning out a bunch of people who don‚Äôt have the skills needed for today‚Äôs economy, then I question whether that‚Äôs smart.
@Ottauquechee @devreal @Ocasio2018 I have a lowly B.A. Obv I agree with you there. Just don‚Äôt like the idea that everyone gets free school regardless. If my tax dollars are subsidizing, I want something useful e.g. comp sci.
@Ottauquechee @devreal @Ocasio2018 Something that translates into a productive job. STEM, for example. We need people with those degrees. I would argue there are other fields that don‚Äôt really contribute anything to society. We only need so many theater majors, for example.
@NxBlanchard @mtjohnson01 @KateKarwowska @LegendaryEnergy @Ocasio2018 But your attitude is what I love about Canadians - truly. I love Canadians because they‚Äôre just so darn nice and sensible. Glad y‚Äôall enjoy your system.
@NxBlanchard @mtjohnson01 @KateKarwowska @LegendaryEnergy @Ocasio2018 You want your tax dollars supporting someone who doesn‚Äôt work and contributes nothing to Canada? I‚Äôve got no problem giving people what they earn. I don‚Äôt want to subsidize loafing, and if you think some people don‚Äôt loaf, I don‚Äôt think you‚Äôre living in reality.
@Ottauquechee @devreal @Ocasio2018 I‚Äôm 42 going on 43. I‚Äôd like to think that‚Äôs not old, but I‚Äôll leave that judgement to you. I like to think I‚Äôm young enough not to be a complete cynic but old enough to know neither party is right. Draw a line in the middle and that‚Äôs probably where we ought to be.
@Simmonds91R @Falcone234 @thrillmaster89 @GustavMahlerJr @Ocasio2018 It goes both ways, doesn‚Äôt it? Those who espouse gov‚Äôt-run healthcare love to trot out stories of bankruptcy and so forth. The truth is always somewhere in the middle. Unfortunately, that‚Äôs a place neither party exists in. They‚Äôre both on extremes.
@Simmonds91R @Falcone234 @thrillmaster89 @GustavMahlerJr @Ocasio2018 Look, healthcare is impossibly complex, so I‚Äôll just say it‚Äôs all a tradeoff. You‚Äôre right, but that system also typically means longer waits, less innovation, and poorer quality of care. Americans who make more can have better and faster care. I see that as a feature, not a bug.
@RnOwner @GustavMahlerJr @Ocasio2018 I get it. My point is that the framers espoused the notion that self-reliance ought to be an integral part of the country they created. Seeking to make people reliant on government and not themselves seems a step backward.
@Falcone234 @thrillmaster89 @GustavMahlerJr @Ocasio2018 I‚Äôm not anti-gov‚Äôt. I fully support free healthcare for children, people with disabilities, etc. But IMHO there comes a point where it‚Äôs up to you. If you‚Äôre a sane adult capable of working, earn your way. If you don‚Äôt, I‚Äôm not going to pity you.
@Falcone234 @thrillmaster89 @GustavMahlerJr @Ocasio2018 But I already get healthcare because my job thinks I‚Äôm worth it. Similarly, my nephews will be able to go to college because their parents are socking away money. None of us are rich. We make our own destiny. To me, that‚Äôs America. You get what you earn.
@RnOwner @GustavMahlerJr @Ocasio2018 I was being a little bombastic. I just hate that Dems have demonized people with money. Most people who have a lot earned it. Some didn‚Äôt, but that‚Äôs like calling all poor women welfare queens because a few abuse the system.
@Ottauquechee @devreal @Ocasio2018 Those things are smart investments in Americans. Free job training? All for it. But when you can do whatever you want - work or not work, study something useless, etc - that's a handout. Put simply, I'm for a hand up, not a handout.
@Ottauquechee @devreal @Ocasio2018 Now, if you want the government to pay for healthcare for children, and tuition for useful degrees, I might agree. If everyone gets everything free - you get healthcare if you're unemployed, you get free tuition to study something that has no real-world use - there we part ways.
@Ottauquechee @devreal @Ocasio2018 That notion strikes me as odd. Ought Amazon to have joined the rest of the retail world in selling from brick and mortar stores? Of course not. It matters not whether we're like the rest of the world, but whether we're right. I believe we are. Capitalism is the ultimate motivator
@mtjohnson01 @KateKarwowska @LegendaryEnergy @Ocasio2018 You and me, sadly. I get your point. I used to be a Dem, still consider myself one, but the party's shifted way too far left. I don't hate the ACA, but going beyond that to single-payer is a bridge too far. My kingdom for a sane candidate from either party.
@RnOwner @GustavMahlerJr @Ocasio2018 No. I love this country. I just think it runs counter to the very fiber of this country's being, which is epitomized in the Constitution: we're guaranteed the pursuit of happiness, not happiness itself. Massive entitlements are diametrically opposed to that notion.
@thrillmaster89 @GustavMahlerJr @Ocasio2018 As to the connection to Ms. Ocasio-Cortez: I believe she was directly asked how much the policy positions she likes (single payer health care, etc) would cost. Unless she's updated since, I believe she didn't know. It worries me she's for something with no idea of cost.
@thrillmaster89 @GustavMahlerJr @Ocasio2018 It's just a straw man number I threw out. Sweden has ~62%. Finland's ~52%. Norway's corporate tax rates are as high as 78%. I'm being a little hyperbolic, but you get the point: they'll be very high. Most of your money will go to the government.
@GustavMahlerJr @Ocasio2018 Because she wants to take 75% of everyone's paycheck and use it to fund socialist programs. If you want that, move to Europe. The rest of us would prefer the government stay out of the way rather than running every aspect of our lives.
@KateKarwowska @LegendaryEnergy @Ocasio2018 The equivalent would be everyone, even those who decide not to have a car, paying $500 even though they don't drive. Not exactly fair, is it?
@KateKarwowska @LegendaryEnergy @Ocasio2018 But you don't have to drive. Plenty of folks, especially in big cities, don't. Not exactly the same. You didn't have a choice prior to the ACA tax penalty being eliminated.
@Ocasio2018 Then perhaps you can understand why the rest of us don't want to pay $40 trillion for the socialist programs you love so much.
@1067theFan Want hard numbers? The 2017 national revenue for each team was $256MM. Suppose every corporate client left. What's that impact? A few million? It's not going to sink the team, particularly if they're better as a result of claiming Foster and local revenue increases as a result.
@DCSportsCurse @1067theFan Teams are so incredibly myopic. After a few weeks, the media moves on to something else. The smart teams are the ones who weather that storm. Joe Mixon punched a woman. No one cares about that now. The world's moved on to the next guy.
@1067theFan Ticket buyers, even corporate ones, are probably not very consequential when compared to revenue from the league's media deals and such. That's the real cash cow. If the four fired guys can't understand that, good riddance. They clearly don't understand the economics of the NFL.
@john_keim What an asshole.
@DhaSickest Carla actually does training herself as well. It's a beautiful farm out in Catlett. Bit of a drive but it's worth it. My parents used them for their mini dachshund Greta who sadly passed this year. If you get in touch, they will know the Worleys and Greta.
@DhaSickest My parents and I have been using https://t.co/1J4thDzRgA for decades. Best kennel in the area. I am sure Carla, the owner, would be able to hook you up with a really great trainer.
@ABC Nice work.
@dcsportsbog @cajuncooks Not I, sir.
@wojespn Nope. Translation: We don't care if you do it, but the media can never find out. The NBA does not care about tampering. It cares about the media finding out about it.
@cajuncooks @dcsportsbog Proudly. Both of my grandfathers served in WW2. I'm so embarrassed on their behalf that men are now watching red-haired zilches play video games and bald-headed zilches in capris pump their fists. What a collection of assholes we are.

@FelicityHuffman @WilliamHMacy Y‚Äôall are adorable.
@poundaway @wojespn I‚Äôm a human being with a soul, so yes, I am. I‚Äôm not dumb. I know racism exists in 2018. I‚Äôd never say otherwise. It just saddens me the league let LeBron off the hook for perpetuating a stereotype that led to that tragic event.
@poundaway @wojespn The point is that it‚Äôs not really a positive comment. It‚Äôs like saying hey, Lamar Jackson can really run fast. Sounds like a compliment. It‚Äôs not. It‚Äôs tantamount to saying that‚Äôs all he can do. He‚Äôs a good QB.
@lebigthagote @IsaiahR30482315 @wojespn Sterling‚Äôs a bad guy. That said, here‚Äôs what he did: privately say to V Stiviano he didn‚Äôt want her associating with black guys. Words. That gets you run out of the league, but LeBron perpetuates anti-semitism and nothing? Tell me why.
@poundaway @wojespn Are you aware the entire reason the holocaust happened is because Hitler demonized Jews basically for having money/jobs that Germans should have had? The stereotype of Jews having/loving money is not a positive one. It‚Äôs the rationale for anti-Semitism.
@Trey_but_evil @wojespn And if you think Jews having money isn‚Äôt offensive, then why was Jimmy the Greek run out of the league for saying black players have fast twitch muscles that make them better players? Because it perpetuates a stereotype. If you don‚Äôt know Jimmy the Greek, look it up.
@Trey_but_evil @wojespn And by the way, yes, LeBron is a better human being than Sterling. I‚Äôm being a little bombastic. But this was a missed opportunity. LBJ could have used this as a teaching moment about anti-Semitism. Instead, we got this, an apparent defense of anti-semitism as long as it‚Äôs lyrics
@Trey_but_evil @wojespn 6 million dead Jews versus slavery. I‚Äôm sure there‚Äôs a false equivalency there. Thanks for playing, Stephen A. Smith Jr. Maybe learn more than the past year of history.
@KingMaine1328 @wojespn Well said. With your poor grammar and adult use of emojis I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôve made a real impact on the world. Have a great life, dullard!
@Roddy_94 @wojespn Hey, dumbass: the perception Jews have all the money is why Hitler exterminated 6 million of them. Go learn your fucking history before you embarrass yourself further. It doesn‚Äôt matter it was a lyric. He‚Äôs perpetuating a view that directly led to the holocaust.
@KingMaine1328 @wojespn Wow. Just a devastating response. I‚Äôm going to have to tap out. I cannot compete with bad Kobe memes. You win, sir.
@ManuGinBaldSpot @ferraranyc @wojespn Yet Donald Sterling was run out of the league for saying words. Apparently that was a big deal. One might guess it was a big deal because he insulted black folks rather than Jews.
@wojespn Classic non-apology. ‚ÄúSorry if YOU were offended‚Äù. Try having a white player quote lyrics with the n word and let‚Äôs see what happens. Donald Sterling was run out of the league on a rail. LeBron does a non-apology and he‚Äôs immediately forgiven. No double standard at all.
@ajupright @McChicken32 @wojespn @dandakich 6 million of them were systematically exterminated. I‚Äôll put that up against the horrors of slavery any day. The only reason the @nba did this is because there are few Jewish players to anger, whereas when the n word gets dropped, it upsets most players.
@ajupright @McChicken32 @wojespn @dandakich You‚Äôre not a smart person. The perception that Jews were ‚Äútaking all the money‚Äù is more or less what caused the holocaust. Hitler wanted to get rid of them so Germans would be better off.
@wojespn I look forward to the @nba accepting the same explanation the next time the n word comes up. I‚Äôm sure there won‚Äôt be a double standard at all.
@Reuters But that‚Äôs half of their GDP!
@masnKerr Yes. Have my @TimRaines30 jersey ready.
@granthpaulsen Time to switch our fandom to the @Browns.
@GoHeels252 @MoveTheSticks No - the offense gets all the calls, because offense sells ticket and the NFL  cares about üí¥.
@MoveTheSticks Thank you for saying what I wanted to. Haden gets called for PI multiple times but he gets pushed on and nothing. I have no dog in the fight. Clearly the NFL wants more offense, rules be damned.
@BigOandDukes His naked contempt is stunning.
@LATimesfarmer Been watching him since he was destroying my Virginia Tech Hokies with Pitt. As good as a player he is, he‚Äôs a better man.

@ChuckGrassley Senator, I've been a lifelong Democrat, but I just want to say I appreciate your pragmatism and ability to see things from all sides. It's a quality sorely lacking in many of your colleagues. Also, nice job on the criminal justice bill. Merry Christmas.
@JohnMastrangel8 @Uniguy96 @wolfblitzer You mean like how federal employees with lots of credit card debt will see that debt continue to spiral? Just own it: you don't care about federal employees. Fine. Stop trying to convince us you care and admit you have a deep-seated enmity to them. Be true to yourself.
@JohnMastrangel8 @wolfblitzer Dude, you're an asshole. Most people live month to month. Waiting a month for a paycheck is not a f**king joke to them. To say otherwise is to be nakedly cruel to those folks who have zero say in the matter.
@wolfblitzer THANK YOU, Wolf. Stop arguing about the wall and start talking about how we're going to make sure those workers can pay their bills. Can @CNN send you in there to broker a compromise? I seriously think you could get it done.
@RH201ST @BrickONeil @ABC @senatemajldr Only if the American people buy into it. We have the power to stop it. All we need to do is use it. Unfortunately, all we're doing is rewarding both parties for hyperpartisanship.
@BarefootNerd @CBSNews Please don't condescend. Obviously I know that. The point is: adding more walls is not some sort of radical departure. We already have them. Dems are painting this as some sort of crazy notion that has no basis in reality, which isn't so. Walls are already up.
@WillyPWriter12 @ABC It's not about being right or wrong. That's what you don't get. You're right, but that does nothing to help the fed employees who aren't going to get paid. They can't go cash "we're right" checks at the bank. They'll not be able to pay bills. Is that worth being right?
@WillyPWriter12 @ABC Yes, we could spend the $ more wisely. No, the wall won't work. That said, ask yourself this: do you envision any scenario where he caves before Dems? I don't. You cave now or cave later. He's crazy. He's the guy who'd rather crash his car into you than veer off into the ditch.
@JohnB_DJ @CBSNews And that person will ALWAYS win a game of chicken. Dems will not win this one. What do you think's going to happen? He comes back from Mar-A-Lago and suddenly doesn't demand his wall? No. He's going to let the shutdown go until he gets what he wants.
@JohnB_DJ @CBSNews This is not a game. While you laugh at him, a lot of federal workers are going to be unable to pay their bills in January. Do you get that? Does anyone get that? POTUS won't back down. I dislike him very much, but in this game of chicken, he'll wreck both cars rather than give in
@BarefootNerd @CBSNews You know we have a whole lot of fencing/walls/etc on the southern border already, right? It saddens me to know most Americans are ignorant of this fact. It's not about building a wall that isn't there. It's about adding more. We have walls today.
@lsutigerzfan @CBSNews You get that tweets like yours are exactly what Russia wanted, right? That you're playing right into Putin's hands? Russia wants us to fight each other. Stop it. When you fan the flames, you're only furthering the goals of our enemies.
@ghgrossman1 @CBSNews Sir, please live in reality. He *is* the president whether you like it or not (like you, I don't). Putting your head in the sand and pretending otherwise is something a child should do, not an adult. Deal with reality on reality's terms.
@BrickONeil @ABC @senatemajldr You mean like the House is going to do to Trump in 2019? Let's just acknowledge both parties are being run by extremists who have zero interest in the compromise necessary to effectively run government. By the way, you get that Russia did its meddling to make this happen, right?
@dretteagauche @ABC 100% of the people currently in the presidency are for it. That's the only number that matters. Either the Senate caves or the government shuts down for a month plus. Trump's a madman, but he's the POTUS, and as long as he is, he has veto power to get what he wants.
@dawjr2006 @ABC I'll take giving him $5B for his nonsense wall over shutting the government down. I don't expect Senate Dems to agree. Unfortunately, this means a lot of federal workers will have trouble paying their bills in January.
@dawjr2006 @ABC It's called veto power. The POTUS has it and he's allowed to use it. He's a full third of the entire government. You can love him or hate him. The calculus doesn't change. If Dems don't give him his pet project, the government shuts down for a month or more, period.
@WillyPWriter12 @ABC So what? Government wastes money all the time. It's mostly what they do. Ask yourself which is better: giving POTUS $5B for his silly wall or letting the government shut down? I'll take the former because I care more about the trains running on time than making a political point.
@ABC I don't like McConnell, but he's right. Everyone needs to calm down. The world won't end if we give Trump $5B for his silly wall. It's not worth shutting the government down over. Any argument to the contrary is partisan nonsense.
@AHeilender @ABC @robertewen You get it. I wish more people did. Stop attacking each other. That's what Russia and China want. Instead, calm down, get in a room, find a solution that everyone can agree to, and do what you're paid to do: keep the country running.
@themadrush @ABC You're smart. That's what Dems should do. Pretend to give Trump his wall so he feels like he won, then actually use it for better things. Problem is, this isn't about finding a way to get it done. This is red meat for the 2020 election. Schumer has no interest in a compromise.
@alphacenturian1 @ABC Only if the sides want to compromise, which they don't. Seriously, have you been in a cave for several years? There is no more compromise. Both sides demand what they want to turn out voters for an election that isn't going to happen for another two years. It's madness.
@ABC I mean, I know that will never happen because Dems, like POTUS, care more about giving red meat to their base than actually getting anything done. Just know that EVERY ONE OF YOU - POTUS, senators, etc - are responsible for fed workers that won't get paid.
@ABC It's $5 billion. That's nothing in the grand scheme of things. Sen. Schumer, please just be honest and admit this is gamesmanship to turn this into a talking point for 2020, because shutting gov't down over $5B is incredibly irresponsible.
@Reuters Shoot it down. If a stray bullet hits someone, so be it. You cannot let one jackass shut down an airport for days. Or fire a rocket at it. For Christ's sake, do something other than sit on your hands and let this continue.
@Reuters Whoever is flying that drone should be drawn and quartered. I'm from the USA but I think the world would fully support a painful death for this jackass. UK, what say you?
@ManscapedGents Holy christ is this product disgusting. Please go out of business ASAP so the world can be rid of your nonsense.
@FiveThirtyEight It's actually a good way to weed out idiots. If someone says "Die Hard" is their favorite Christmas movie, cut them out of your life. You'll be much better for it.

@SenSchumer @realDonaldTrump Sen. Schumer, I like you, but I presume you know the President has veto power. Stop placing blame and pass a bill the POTUS will sign. Be the adult in the room, stop thinking about positioning your party for 2020, and stop this madman from shutting down the government.
@_JayMorales_ @ThatDudeMaReeve @darrenrovell @drdrew Hey, thanks for your poor grammar and embarrassingly bad punctuation. Please stay out of debates of logic and sense. It doesn't suit you. I'm sure you're a fine person but you do not have the brainpower to engage in this way. Know thyself, sir.
@_JayMorales_ @MartinDBunch @ThatDudeMaReeve @darrenrovell @drdrew You're wrong and are embarrassing yourself with your clueless take. Addiction is not a choice. It's determined by brain chemistry. You're not a smart guy, and that's fine. Go find smarter people and listen to them.
@BetoKamala2020 @FiveThirtyEight Alrighty, let's just wave our magic wand and conjure up a veto-proof majority. Because that's what you're going to need. Such a thing does not exist in reality today. Please live in reality, sir, and not your blue-tinged safe space. By the way, I'm a Democrat, or so I thought.
@MartinDBunch @_JayMorales_ @ThatDudeMaReeve @darrenrovell @drdrew You couldn't be more wrong. The whole "physically dependent" thing is nonsense. Ask an addiction medicine specialist like @drdrew. Either you can stop in the face of consequences or you can't. If you can't, you're an addict, period. Educate yourself.
@wojespn Keep on letting the players run the league. I'm sure it's going to turn out great in the end.
@CNNPolitics Great take, Chicken Little. We elect a new president in 2020. The world will not crumble in that time. Have some faith. Our government was designed precisely to minimize damage from a situation like this. I know fearmongering sells but get ahold of yourself.
@BetoKamala2020 @FiveThirtyEight Well then we're in what you might call a Mexican standoff. You can't have both. So, to be clear: you're OK with the government shutting down for a month or more to prevent funding for the wall? Trump's a f**king madman. He will shut down the government for as long as it takes.
@FiveThirtyEight And by the way, the @538 take misses the mark. Trump never wanted to be POTUS. He ran to make headlines. He doesn't care. Your take is predicated on a POTUS that wants the job. He doesn't. Some men want to see the world burn, and he's one of them.
@FiveThirtyEight The headline should be "Americans don't want to shut down government over the border wall but they also don't want to make the concessions necessary for that to happen, thus clarifying we're a nation of dumbasses". A little long but you get the point.
@united Y'all should be concerned someone runs off with these pups. They're adorable.
@_JayMorales_ @ThatDudeMaReeve @darrenrovell @drdrew You don't get it. Who among us hasn't had a drop of alcohol? That's enough to trigger addiction. It's not a choice. Some people can take substances without consequences, some can't. It's biologically determined, and your nonsense new age take is simply wrong. Go educate yourself.
@ThatDudeMaReeve @darrenrovell No, that's exactly what it means. Addiction is a disorder of the brain's reward system. There can be no clearer mental health issue than that. Go listen/read everything @drdrew has done and you'll start to get it. The man knows addiction &amp; explains it very well.
@Matt_Toasty @darrenrovell It's more or less settled that addiction is a disorder of the brain's reward system. A person who cannot stop using substances despite significant consequences - e.g. losing a job - has this brain disorder and needs treatment. Full stop.
@darrenrovell It also shows how clueless most people are on the issue. Unless you're a mental health professional or otherwise very educated on the issue, please stop giving your opinion and listen to the smarter people in the room. Giving your nonsense take helps no one.
@CNNPolitics Him and the rest of the country aside from @realDonaldTrump.
@WSJ What a collection of assholes.
@JeffFlake I understand Senate Dems consider this a marquee issue and do not want to give in lest it hurt them in 2020. Nonetheless, life goes on, the government must stay open, and if the President won't do it, the Senate must. There is no other option.
@JeffFlake You and Sen. Coons were instrumental in crafting a solution to the Kavanaugh nomination. Get in a room and figure out a way to make POTUS feel like he got his wall, then redirect the money to something more sane. As long as he can say he won, he won't care where the $ really goes
@JeffFlake Sen. Flake - I truly believe the President will let the government shut down for a month or more on this issue. Please consider giving in, giving him his silly $5B, and keeping our government open. Senators must find a way to mollify him and move on. Unfair fed employees get hurt
@suejiron @PeeWeeWinston @ABC It's terribly sad. This and the Colorado Watts case are unbelievably tragic. It embarrasses me as a man to think another man could do this to someone he supposedly loves. If you've fallen out of love, be a man, tell her, and face the consequences. To murder her is unconscionable.
@Reuters The person flying this drone should be shot on sight. It'll leave the world a better place.
@ABC 21 days is the longest previous shutdown (1995-1996). My money's on this one being longer. Trump will never give in on his wall and Dems will never give in on opposing it. I predict 30+ days. Sad federal employees get caught in this partisan blame game.
@ABC There's no showdown. 100% chance we go into a lengthy shutdown. I predict it will be the longest to date.
@PeeWeeWinston @ABC There's this pesky need for "evidence" before you can arrest someone. But yes, it's basically always the spouse/partner.
@chaddukes @JunksRadio @PonyTailsMusic To bed, what a day! Love you Shooter.
@mbobbish @keepemhonest2 @AP Yes, that‚Äôs how the world works. You give to get and vice versa. Dems have gotten their way on things e.g. repealing the ACA. You win some, you lose some. That‚Äôs life. Caving on one issue to get agreement on another is the basic currency of government.
@mbobbish @keepemhonest2 @AP If you genuinely believe that, you have zero faith in our country. We survived the Civil War. We survived the Great Depression. We survived Vietnam. We survived Nixon. We‚Äôll survive Trump. Stop being a narcissist and believing the media story that this is the end of the world.
@QuockerWodging @RobPurdue2 @AP That‚Äôs an attitude befitting a child. Ought Barack Obama have capitulated to what the GOP wanted? Of course not. It‚Äôs a two way street. You give to get and vice versa. Get some concession from Trump on something else, give him his $5B for his nonsense wall, and move on.
@RobPurdue2 @AP Of course, and they should. But that‚Äôs not what this is about. This is about a relatively minor issue. $5B simply isn‚Äôt very much in the grand scheme. Dems wouldn‚Äôt be letting him run unfettered. They‚Äôd give him a minor win on a pet issue.
@RobPurdue2 @QuockerWodging @AP Do you find that surprising? The GOP dislikes government. The Dems always suffer more during shutdowns because they‚Äôre the party that likes government. By the way, I‚Äôm watching football on my 100‚Äù 1080p projector so yes, I have a ‚ÄúTV‚Äù.
@mbobbish @keepemhonest2 @AP Look, we both dislike Trump. Aside from his tax cut, I‚Äôve disliked virtually everything he‚Äôs done. No matter. Like a bad ex before your breakup, we‚Äôre stuck with him for two more years. I say try to make nice and try to make the next 2 years work as best we can.
@keepemhonest2 @mbobbish @AP Just to be clear - you‚Äôre pro-shutdown? You‚Äôd rather shut down the government than throw Trump a $5 billion dollar bone? If so, I vehemently disagree.
@mbobbish @keepemhonest2 @AP Is that right or wrong? Neither. It‚Äôs what you have to do to preserve sanity. The blame game serves no one. Keep the ship afloat for another 2 years and everything resets. Find someone you really love.
@mbobbish @keepemhonest2 @AP Really, it‚Äôs like a bad relationship. You both know you‚Äôre going to break up eventually but you try to make peace while you‚Äôre together. What you don‚Äôt want is to have a big fight where the police get called, and that‚Äôs what a government shutdown is. Better to keep the peace.
@mbobbish @keepemhonest2 @AP Your point would be valid except for the fact that he leaves the Oval Office if he doesn‚Äôt win in 2020. Look at the big picture. He‚Äôs probably going to lose in 2020. If we need to give him a few wins here and there over the next two years to make him feel good, fine.
@colbyscowart @ABC We are basically in 100% agreement. You and I both know his campaign promise to ‚Äúbuild the wall‚Äù is dumb. But he‚Äôs who he is, and this is his silly pet issue. If it takes $5 billion to make him happy and get us to 2020, so be it. Life goes on.
@RobPurdue2 @AP And the POTUS is the biggest check and balance of them all. He holds the office. He has more power than any other person in our democracy. He often gets what he wants, for good or for bad. Accept that and move on. Again - I VOTED FOR HILLARY. I dislike Trump. For the record.
@QuockerWodging @RobPurdue2 @AP He‚Äôs not a toddler. He‚Äôs the POTUS, like it or not, and he has the powers afforded to that office. Do what needs to be done to keep this country running. That‚Äôs what adults do. Instead, Dems are leaping over each other to prove who‚Äôs the most anti-Trump with an eye to 2020.
@ProFootballTalk I‚Äôm very pro-legalization, but if you can‚Äôt stop smoking pot when you know you‚Äôre going to be tested for it, you have a problem. That‚Äôs the real issue - not whether marijuana is or is not OK, but that Gordon knows the rules and has zero ability to adhere to them. He‚Äôs an addict.
@mbobbish @keepemhonest2 @AP It‚Äôs always ugly watching the sausage get made. You won‚Äôt like every bit that goes in. Don‚Äôt let the little things distract you. Your job is not to be morally right on every last issue. It‚Äôs to keep the country running. If that means sometimes caving, fine. Get the job done.
@mbobbish @keepemhonest2 @AP And by the way, I thought I was a Democrat until 2016, when I learned that being an adult and working with the President was tantamount to treason. I dislike Trump, but I‚Äôm an adult. I‚Äôm fine with my representatives doing what they have to do to keep the country running.
@mbobbish @keepemhonest2 @AP He‚Äôs up for re-election in 2020. If the country hates him, they‚Äôll vote him out. Keep your eye on the big picture. If $10 billion is what it takes to keep the country running, so be it. Vote him out in 2020 and it all goes away.
@colbyscowart @ABC He‚Äôs not getting everything he wants. This is just his pet issue. He‚Äôs hung up on it. Fine. Concede on this specific point. Get what you can in return. That‚Äôs how the world works. It‚Äôs not about moral platitudes. It‚Äôs about doing what‚Äôs necessary to get the job done.
@KarlieInCali @AP $5 billion is 0.5% of discretionary spending, and discretionary spending is about 15% of the overall budget. It‚Äôs basically nothing in the grand scheme of things. There‚Äôs little financial cost. As for moral cost: a wall is amoral. Folks will still be able to apply for entry.
@KFrequency @keepemhonest2 @AP That‚Äôs what Dems are failing to understand. Trump is a media whore. All he wants is to say he got what he wanted. He has zero interest in the details. So, you let him think he got what he wanted, then quietly take the money and do something else with it.
@KFrequency @keepemhonest2 @AP Here‚Äôs the smart play. Let Trump tout how he got $5 billion for his wall. Then, you actually spend it for better things that help border security. All he wants is a photo op to say he did what he said he would do. Once the money is allocated, just quietly redirect it.
@keepemhonest2 @AP Are you aware we already have a substantial wall along the Mexico border? Clearly past administrations saw value in that. It‚Äôs not nothing. Trump‚Äôs over the top on this, but in the end, $5 billion for border security isn‚Äôt entirely irrational.
@RobPurdue2 @AP So you‚Äôre OK shutting the government down for a month? Sounds fairly irresponsible to me. $5 billion is 0.5% of discretionary spending. Why not just say let‚Äôs chalk it up to Trump being an idiot and do what you have to to keep government open?
@colbyscowart @ABC Then give him what he wants. That‚Äôs a power the president holds, and whether you love him or hate him, he‚Äôs in the Oval Office. A true compromise, by definition, must be acceptable to the president.
@ABC I‚Äôm no fan of Trump, but let‚Äôs be clear: Dems have zero interest in compromise. They‚Äôre all vying to be the most anti-Trump in 2020. This is not good. Figure out a compromise and keep the gov‚Äôt open. That‚Äôs your job - not to set yourselves up for the best position in 2020.
@AP Just f**king pass it. The border wall is mostly nonsense but it‚Äôs not worth shutting the government down over.
@ABC Awesome. Win-win-win.
@BigOandDukes Can you please do the ‚Äúbang on this mug all day‚Äù bit on Friday?
@JK4D7 @AschNBA @SeanDeveney This from a man who admits his own tweets are mostly garbage. Great stuff, man. Maybe learn to express yourself beyond standard GIFs.
@TheJKayKid @AschNBA @SeanDeveney A reply really filled with great content. Go fill out some Mad Libs, sir. That‚Äôs the extent of your ability to communicate.
@chaddukes Christmas is the best!
@AschNBA @SeanDeveney You‚Äôre an idiot if you watch the NBA regular season. It couldn‚Äôt be more meaningless.
@BlackoutBruce @StevePietaster @BigOandDukes Let me second the call for another #highhorde
@RicBucher Letting the players run the league will eventually be the downfall of the @NBA
@robcorddry Every time I hear "sidebar" I pull my collar and say "or any bar". I love you, man. God bless.

@darrenrovell Sounds like a cemetery.
@DhaSickest Have you seen True Detective season 1? If not, watch that.
@chaddukes @Borderlands This. Thank you for leading the charge, Shooter. You‚Äôre a good man.
@BuckyBrooks Preach!
@chaddukes RIP @KillDevilDills :-(
@BuckyBrooks @Ravens And John Harbaugh is a great coach.

@JFrankHanrahan @GlassJoeJP Wouldn‚Äôt shock me if they dropped Sanchez and picked up Kaep this week.
@DhaSickest D, you should check out @Dorseyart https://t.co/Sf3AlINz3i - he does AMAZING paintings of players.
@chaddukes @Dorseyart This has Sullen Oscar potential.
@NoahDolan @AdamSchefter @KVanValkenburg @mikerothstein Brutalizing? Really? Please go find a dictionary and educate yourself as to the meaning of the word. If you can read, that is, which seems far from a certainty.
@MatthewReimbold @AdamSchefter @KVanValkenburg @mikerothstein For the same reason when there's a police shooting you get a 20 second clip, not the full footage: the media is selling a story, not the truth. "NFL player beats woman" gets clicks. The real story doesn't.
@29nkshah @AdamSchefter @KVanValkenburg @mikerothstein Then why hasn't he been arrested? If, as you say, there was an offense, ought that not to have happened by now? Or, is this something that happens fairly frequently in America and we only care because he's an NFL player? I'll put my money on the latter.
@RandyFiddler1 @AdamSchefter @KVanValkenburg @mikerothstein Are you high? I guarantee you another team will pick him up. Look at Joe Mixon. He coldcocked a woman and he's playing on Sundays. After a few months everyone will demonize another NFL player and Hunt will be a distant memory.
@chaddukes @SoldierSuicide Done and done. Well worth it to support my #1 broadcaster's birthday and a noble cause. Enjoy going over the hill, Shooter.
@darrenrovell Jags have given up.
@cam4714 @EBJunkies @drabtshirt Or - for a day he becomes Drab Egg Nog.
@EBJunkies @drabtshirt The Evan Williams egg nog is really good. Puts me in a festive mood.
@AP_Politics He‚Äôd be a great candidate.
@Gil_Brandt Just an amazing picture. Have fun!
@chaddukes It‚Äôs what‚Äôs best for business.
@dcsportsbog Maybe have an interesting take once in a while? Is that an option?
@ByMikeJones @USATODAY By your logic, no media outlet should ever hire anyone who‚Äôs been accused of DV. Sound good? Awesome. In fact, let‚Äôs just shoot them. Per your logic, these are people incapable of redemption.
@JimTrotter_NFL A modest proposal: the electric chair for anyone accused of DV or DUI. After all, these are the incorrigibles, void of any redemption, scum of the earth. What say you, Jim?
@michaelpRTD Why do they need to do vetting before claiming? We all know he's going on the commissioner's exempt list, investigation to follow, and potentially suspended. He's not going to be on the team until that's completed.
@CraigHoffman Craig, then what's the rule? Anyone arrested for DV gets an immediate lifetime ban? Please, enlighten us on what the rule ought to be. Right now, it's a 6 game ban the first time. The NFL made that decision, not the team. If you think that's insufficient, your quarrel is w NFL.
@CraigHoffman I mean, seriously, what's your take on Kaep? Because if you think the NFL is colluding to keep him out, and you think it's OK for the NFL to collude and deny other players a chance to play, you're making an incoherent argument. Collusion is collusion.
@CraigHoffman Then if he did it, he serves a six game suspension. That's what the NFL's rules say, right? Why is that wrong? You're saying a six game suspension isn't sufficient? What you're suggesting is effectively collusion. Do you understand that?
@CraigHoffman Unless your argument is that the NFL clubs should agree never to sign anyone suspected of domestic violence, in which case that's collusion and probably illegal. Not that you care because Kaep good, domestic violence bad.
@CraigHoffman Then why is the NFL's stated rule of the shop a six game ban for domestic violence? If the rule is domestic violence means an immediate ban, the rules should state that, not a six game suspension for the first offense.
@TomPelissero If he committed domestic violence, the NFL can give him a six game suspension. Them's the rules. If the rule is domestic violence = immediate lifetime ban, the NFL needs to make that the rule, not 6 games to start with. You can't change the law of the shop without notification.
@lindseyadler Is there anything people aren't outraged about in 2018?
@CBSNews Is the gun being pointed at them on camera left or camera right?
@NateSilver538 In all seriousness, they should just outsource it to @NateSilver538 or @kenpomeroy or someone who knows what they're doing. Why they instead chose to come up with their own nonsense formula is beyond me.
@PaulBegala @TeamPelosi @repbenraylujan @dccc @HouseMajPAC You should be congratulating @realDonaldTrump. He's the sole reason for the high turnout. Nothing Dems did was responsible.
@nationalcares New site having problems. Can log in, cannot see/make rentals. Old site working. FYI.
@drabtshirt Full release.
FINALLY remembered to use the @BigOandDukes Amazon tab to order Christmas presents. Folks, don‚Äôt be takers - go online right now, hit that tab, and order one or more Christmas presents. Costs you nothing and helps the show we love. #LLTH
@BuckyBrooks And my goodness, how about Baker Mayfield? Show me a RB who‚Äôs taken a team from unfathomably awful to looking like a playoff team. They don‚Äôt exist. You cannot win with a run game alone. I love the elite RBs. They‚Äôre complementary pieces once you have a QB.
@BuckyBrooks Counter: numbers aren‚Äôt wins. Gurley‚Äôs numbers were meaningless until they got a QB and a quality coach. OTOH, Barkley and the Giants are headed for the top of the draft again because Eli is done. QB &gt; RB for every single team in the league.
@DhaSickest You gotta get with @KELLYOUBREJR on a lifestyle shoe deal. Y‚Äôall are the style icons for the DC area.
@ABC Please pull all life support. Thanks!
@BuckyBrooks @Ravens What do you think the future holds? My guess is LJ plays in more packages next year and they go to him full time in 2020. Can‚Äôt cut Flacco before then without a huge cap hit.
@DhaSickest They gone all @Zatarains on it
@Brett_McMurphy TRICKERATION
@DhaSickest Nick B coming up big!
@DhaSickest @fhmoreau Great fight on that TD!
@AP Finally, something we can all agree on. Leave him there.
@BBCWorld I‚Äôm an American. Can someone please clue me in to what the protesters want? Or what they‚Äôre angry about, aside from fuel prices?
@TeamCoachBuzz @HokiesMBB Great job Coach!
@UCF_Football @Brett_McMurphy Speedy recovery brother. üôè
@WhistlerBlckcmb @ryanregehr Fair warning: I am coming up there from DC and taking Jasper home with me.
@Brett_McMurphy Great game!
@MoveTheSticks Why do teams chase points so early? I remember a saner day when going for 2 was reserved for the last (or second to last) possession of the game. In the NCAA, don‚Äôt give up a layup XP. Math doesn‚Äôt work.
@BitingChihuahua @adamcarolla Also, a pair of needle nose pliers for cranking the windows, IIRC.
@adamcarolla And who knows - maybe one of those 1983 Toyota pickups was once driven by Adam.
@DhaSickest Ain‚Äôt life grand? Happy Thanksgiving ü¶É
@granthpaulsen Have a great Thanksgiving, GP. I‚Äôll not hold your disdain for cranberries against you.
@granthpaulsen No cranberry? How dare you, sir.
@AdamSchefter Great game. Could be a national championship preview.
@chaddukes @bigdamnband @PonyTailsMusic Dotson lying face down in the pool is an amazing touch!
@BigOandDukes @chaddukes @drabtshirt @oscarradio Thankful I got back on the BOAD Reloaded train this year. I hope you all have a great Thanksgiving.
@ABC His DNA was found on her and he confessed. Let‚Äôs not overthink this thing, folks. DNA + confession = guilty.
@corbinbernsen @TVLine Been to any drum circles recently? :)
@JonHeyman @MarkAselstine As a SEA fan, do not like. Doesn‚Äôt shed much salary and Segura‚Äôs a better player than Myers IMHO. Doesn‚Äôt get the team much younger, either. Plus, creates a hole at SS unless you want to move Gordon there, which seems... suboptimal.
@OrRite_Then @ABC I guess you could boycott gas since 90% of their exports are oil. For most of us, that's not an option.
@ABC There's no good answer here. Stop arms sales and the Saudis buy from a country like Russia or China known for their poor human rights record. Keep selling arms to the Saudis and we condone a terrible human rights violation.
@ABC ? for the Dems: what happens if we cease arms sales and the Saudis turn to China for their arms? Is it worth that to make a statement over human rights? Keeping in mind China has a terrible human rights record.
@united No - I was praising the new system. :) The almost-missed-flight was before you started boarding notification. With boarding notification, now I don't have to worry about that. TL;DR: all is well and thanks.
@united The boarding start notifications are great. Almost missed a flight when it started boarding early. Never again!
@JoshNorris There's a time and place for salads. Thanksgiving is neither the time nor place.
@davidaldridgedc @MarkelleF Kawhi Leonard redux coming....
@funnydanny Time to #TankForTua or #LoseForLawrence
@Redistrict Well put. The GOP needs to return to a focus on low taxes/limited government and do away with the social nonsense - demonizing immigrants/LGBTQ+/etc. Low taxes/limited government is a winning formula once you do away with the rest. It's not 1950 any more. Time to adapt.
@funnydanny REF REF REF REF REF REF REF REF REF
@ShamsCharania If this ends with Grunfeld getting fired, it will all be worth it.
@funnydanny Colt is under contract for $2.8MM in 2019, so I would assume he's the starter for 2019 unless he's real, real bad the rest of the year. That possibly solves the shorter term problem. Longer term, yeah, it's QB draftin' time.
@john_keim Great game though. Feels like we belong in the playoff mix.
@chaddukes A lump of coal in my asshole right now would turn into a diamond instantly.
@granthpaulsen The NFL does not care. Remember: it‚Äôs not about a fair game. It‚Äôs about making money. Every decision made is based on how much profit it will generate.
@RyanDivish You could have stopped after sport. Not sure why we watch.
@RapSheet Awesome. The @NFL needs players with personality. It was a great moment. Hope they continue this policy.
@MoveTheSticks Like these two teams.
@Reuters China is not to be trusted.
@darrenrovell Absolutely. Never compromise your own brand for another.
@Tahjgary Prayers brother üôè
@CWdrygoods He‚Äôs never looked more like the Redskins logo than in this picture. Hope you all are having a great day with your fabulous Xmas products!
@ChaseGoodbread From a VT fan who‚Äôs had to play GT many times, this is 3000% right. It‚Äôs a nightmare to prep for. Doubly so if you have a young team.
@BuckyBrooks Folks have said Kansas should hire a triple option coach, and they‚Äôre 100% right. If you can‚Äôt out-recruit them (Kansas can‚Äôt), out-scheme them.
@BuckyBrooks No doubt. It‚Äôs a coach‚Äôs dream. You can‚Äôt run it at a ‚Äúfootball factory‚Äù - doesn‚Äôt translate to the NFL - but anywhere else it works amazingly well.
@chaddukes Also, Daniel The Slow Cooker can replace &lt;bridge completely burned&gt; in your life. HUGE improvement.
@jd32tc @chaddukes You may know him best from his nickname: "The Slow Cooker"
@chaddukes I pray the @washingtonpost covers the meteoric rise of the slow cooker - off the street to the hottest talent at @Entercom DC in a matter of weeks.
@ABC Oh, the irony of stifling debate at a debating center. Do millennials know what irony is?
@chaddukes YES! This is a fantastic idea. https://t.co/nLvHILge7M
@RodKast This makes my coccyx hurt.
@HokiesMBB @ESPNCharleston @TeamCoachBuzz @TeamCoachBuzz has done a fantastic job. Happy we have him in Blacksburg.
@thepointsguy @united The reading lamps are a nice touch. Overall, looks good!
@WSJ Migrants aren't dumb. They understand game theory very well. When they can do something to achieve a better outcome, they'll do it. Whatever side of the debate you're on, remember that. The immigration system has to be designed with an understanding of real-world human behavior.
@MattHayesCFB Whoever came up with this idea has a solid future in marketing.
@Reuters Or maybe try capitalism. IDK.
@NickDePaula Smart. I daresay most people who buy shoes wear them for comfort/fashion, not for on-court performance. I for one will be very interested to see what @KELLYOUBREJR brings to the table. Would love to see some shoes that don't make me look like I'm headed to a @WashWizards tryout.
@AP_Politics You don't need an expert. The GOP should stick with low taxes and limited government and be moderate on the rest. That's how you win in CA. I daresay most people still like the idea of the government taking less of their money. Nobody likes the DMV.
@darrenrovell I love it when today's young men honor the athletes that came before them. Great job @TheKylerMurray.
@NateSilver538 I hope we get some sort of bipartisan election infrastructure committee to fix what's broken in the electoral mechanics. These midterms exposed how many flaws - long lines, confusing ballots, mail-in signature matching, etc - exist in a system we assumed was better than that.
@VTSportsRT @AndyBitterVT Glad y‚Äôall reached an agreement. Both are solid follows.
@CNNPolitics I‚Äôll say this: if she‚Äôs anything like Cornelius Fudge, steer clear.
@BaldyNFL @Raiders I honestly think the receivers got the play direction wrong. A flood/levels concept to the right would have worked. Unfortunately they all went in rather than out.
@BabyGrootIsKing @APCentralRegion @AP I‚Äôm not religious, but I don‚Äôt think you understand how God works. The Christian God (New Testament version) is about love and forgiveness, not calling people stupid on Twitter. Maybe try a little of that rather than labeling everyone an inveterate racist.
@PsalmSelah @APCentralRegion @AP Let me clue you in to something about jokes: they don‚Äôt always work. Sometimes they fall flat and you look like an asshole. The guy‚Äôs guilty of poor taste and awful judgement. You‚Äôre proving my point, anyway, which is that millennials don‚Äôt understand how jokes work.
@MonsterStan2 It‚Äôs possible to support progress in racial relations while also understanding sometimes people try jokes that fall flat and not assume the guy‚Äôs a wizard of the KKK. I know that sounds foreign to you younger folks, but I assure you it‚Äôs possible.
@MonsterStan2 Part of my work involves improving the Internet in the Caribbean. Not sure if you‚Äôve been there, but there are lots of black folks there. I love that work. I love people of all colors. I can also differentiate between jokes and reality. It‚Äôs not a zero-sum game. Go look that up.
@chaddukes There‚Äôs your name for the @PonyTailsMusic album: Too Fat For Suicide. Wonderful name for a Christmas album.
@APCentralRegion @AP And by the way, the black woman is a city planner. Maybe we could look at that and say hey, that‚Äôs progress? It‚Äôs OK for us to focus on the positive. I know that seems impossible since Twitter obsesses over how everything is terrible, but I assure you it‚Äôs possible.
@APCentralRegion @AP Attention millennials: before you, we had this thing called a ‚Äújoke‚Äù where you were trying to get a laugh and didn‚Äôt mean what you said. You‚Äôve taken that away from us and society is the worse for it. Thanks! Looking forward to the next fun thing you ban from our society.
@ABC This stalling is unprecedented. Every respected election analyst says it's over. Be a good loser. Concede.

@BigOandDukes @drabtshirt @oscarradio I hope he applied the appropriate flavored love oil prior to doing this.
@MarkCom1313 @AP Exactly. Or the red scare. Oh, this communism, it's going to seep into Vietnam and then the Washington monument is going to be replaced with a giant Lenin statue, they said. We're adults. We can figure out what makes sense and what doesn't. We don't need bureaucrats to tell us.
@mic_p_dre @AP "Life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness" has been replaced with "we're going to tell you what you're allowed to use to pursue happiness". Sigh. And it's only going to get worse with more Dems in Congress. They love big gov't telling us what we can and can't do as adults.
@mic_p_dre @AP Right? I seriously want a rimshot any time a politician talks about liberty. Oh, except for we tell you you can't buy big sodas, flavored vapes, marijuana, etc - anything Uncle Sam thinks is bad for you. What a f**cking joke. Founders are rolling in their graves.
@AP This is so depressing. Why should adults lose the ability to buy these products? I detest our current nanny state where government tells us what we can and cannot consume. Make the age limit 21 if you want, but to ban them altogether is a shot across the bow of adult liberty.
@ABC IMHO, the story of the 2018 midterms isn't the blue wave. It's the sad, sad, sad state of our election infrastructure.
@chaddukes @othellobt I call on Entercom DC to fire this man.
@BBCBreaking I have no direct skin in the game being a US citizen, but given the state of Brexit, isn't it time to hold another vote? I suspect the results will differ now that UK citizens have seen how messy it's gotten.

@Redistrict Dave - would love to know what you think about the extreme attention paid to vote counts this year versus years past. Had this level of detail been done every year, how many past race outcomes would have changed? A few? Some? A lot?

@CNNPolitics What just occurred to me: doesn't France owe the US a debt that can never be repaid? There's a credible case to be made that without US action, there would be no France. It'd be a German province.
@CBSNews If they restore @Acosta's pass, won't @realDonaldTrump just refuse to answer any of his questions?
@funnydanny And not just win, but be credible over a period of years. That's the real problem. Sure, they've had a few good seasons, but no sustained run where they field a team we can be proud of. Keep building &amp; they will come.

@danieljpowell @AllanBoone5 @FallenPhilosoph @NateSilver538 I would not assume WI/MI/PA are blue. Dems are wide open to Trump saying the economy's great, my opponent wants to raise taxes, and a vote for me will keep your pocketbooks full. If Trump can make it a referendum on the economy, what's the Dem counter?
@wphamilton @NateSilver538 Notice a trend here? Sitting presidents lose when the economy's bad. Sometimes it's very simple. Economy good, incumbent wins. Economy bad, incumbent loses. Everything else is window dressing.
@NateSilver538 It's as true now as it was when @JamesCarville coined the phrase: "It's the economy, stupid". I find it hard to believe Rust Belt folks will vote for a candidate who wants big government over one that slashed taxes and gave those folks more money in their pockets.
@NateSilver538 ... Gillibrand, Harris, or Booker when the sitting president is a businessman who's presiding over a booming economy? I say no. I think all Trump has to do is say the economy's great, a vote for me will keep it that way, and my opponent will ruin this great economy.
@NateSilver538 I think it's quite possible. Trump needs to hold on to the Rust Belt to win. The election will almost surely be held against the backdrop of a booming economy. The Rust Belt will be a referendum on jobs. Do we really think the Rust Belt is going to vote for someone like...
@darrenrovell Boy, is that ugly. It‚Äôs nice dullards among us can easily be identified.
@DonGeronimoShow Love you, Domingo.
@AP_Politics @debriechmann Well, this is a shock.
@alexfbecker @Dmach1127 @RedSox Justin Verlander is worth probably $100+ million and goes home to Kate Upton. For him to grumble shows an utter lack of perspective. He‚Äôs living a blessed life. He ought to be able to ‚Äúsuffer‚Äù the slings and arrows of the world without whining about this.
@alexfbecker @Dmach1127 @RedSox It just isn‚Äôt. Do you understand those janitors and beer vendors play sports for fun? Baseball is a game. It‚Äôs not real work. I don‚Äôt begrudge any of them their $$. They earn it. But for them to whine like children because Bill James said something is embarrassing.
@alexfbecker @Dmach1127 @RedSox And disrespect? Ha! You get paid a ton of money. It goes with the territory. Please get over your hero worship and realize pro athletes, while yes very talented, are living a dream life. Just about everyone reading this would gladly be insulted 24/7 to get paid like a MLB player.
@alexfbecker @Dmach1127 @RedSox Your first sentence is laughable. Janitors work hard for $10 an hour and you want us to laud MLB players for playing a child‚Äôs game? Sorry, cleaning out a shitter is real work. MLB players have a better life than 99.9999999% of the country.
@NateSilver538 The mechanics of voting are astoundingly backward. My phone can recognize my face but it takes weeks for anyone to know what happened in a tight race.
@CNNPolitics By the way, the judge that wrote the opinion started a scholarship fund for disadvantaged Latino children. One might suggest her own personal politics played into the opinion.
@CNNPolitics Shocking it was filed in the Ninth Circuit. Venue-shopping at its finest.
@chaddukes @NBCSRN Congrats man.
@CNNPolitics That suit is not sufficiently fabulous for a First Man.
@randallw1977 @jprepo1 @RedSox Then you're a waterhead. Seriously, if you do not know who Bill James is, you have zero business making any comments on baseball.
@alexfbecker @Dmach1127 @RedSox ... and apparently it hurt the players' feelings. Remember when men were men instead of petulant children?
@RedSox This is a ridiculous press release. Red Sox players are paid hundreds of thousands to tens of millions of dollars every year to play a child's game. Take some of that money and wipe the tears away if mean ol' Bill James hurt your feelings.
@RyanDivish If the Mariners are willing to push the payroll a bit, signing Ramos and re-signing Cruz would probably be the best move. That'd be a solid lineup top to bottom.
@MSNBC Year of the Sore Losers.
@CNNPolitics Abrams needs to concede. The people have spoken. Continued delay only makes her look like a poor loser.

@Acosta You're not Han Solo, Jim. Please stop making this all about yourself. It's embarrassing for a journalist to be so desperate to be in the spotlight. You are not the story.
@BaldyNFL @dallascowboys @TankLawrence @Titans Baldy, is it safe to say the NFC East defenses are WAY ahead of the NFC east offenses?
@RyanDivish I look forward to the ‚Äúfailed physical - artery blockage‚Äù press release.
@JamesRoday You rascal you.
@BuckyBrooks Let‚Äôs make it simple. Most players, even at elite schools, won‚Äôt make a career of the NFL. It‚Äôs important to prepare those young men for their lives outside of football. The job of a coach isn‚Äôt just to win. It‚Äôs to produce young men we can be proud of.
@scottwthurston @RyanDivish Agree. I just don‚Äôt think they‚Äôre ready to cut him.
@RyanDivish Makes a ton of sense. Smith at CF, Gordon at 2B, Cano at 1B, Healy to DH. I like it.
@CBSNews Can we dispense with the ‚Äúalleged‚Äù?
@ABC @realDonaldTrump There's a simpler explanation: Trump hates Sessions. Once he turns on someone, it's scorched earth. He's hated him ever since he recused himself. That's what this is - revenge for recusal.
@Yamiche The public's mind is already made up. Half of the country loves him, half of the country hates him, and no one's changing their opinion. You need not ask any questions. It's pointless.
@Reuters He's pointing to the spot where French troops will retreat to before surrendering.
@CBSNews @CNN put themselves in this position. When you, as a news organization, make the decision to actively oppose a president, you open yourself up to this accusation of fake news. Had they just reported facts, this accusation wouldn't stick.
@kdusc @ABCPolitics Please. He's not looking for the truth. This guy thinks he's Han Solo leading the resistance. Has he ever met a camera he didn't perform in front of?
@ABCPolitics It's true. @Acosta is a diligent reporter with an insatiable appetite for getting on camera.
@Acosta Boy, that is some Walter Cronkite level reporting. Any hot takes on his hair or something else meaningless?
@OandDquotes @chaddukes @BigOandDukes That's no moon...
@BuckyBrooks @Panthers Me too. It's a huge win-win. Mentally healthy players will perform better - and they'll be happier people.
@michaelpRTD Unlike the Marlins, who clearly never wanted to keep him long term, Nats want Harper to be the face of the franchise for another decade. Wouldn't make sense to offer an opt-out when you want to make sure he's around for the whole contract.
@michaelpRTD The real fair market value part of Stanton's contract is the 10 yrs/$285 million the Yankees assumed. On that basis, it's a very fair offer. True, Stanton has an opt-out after 2020, but I'll wager that was more for him to escape if the Marlins were tanking.
@michaelpRTD Agree 100%. People want to comp him to Stanton, but Stanton's deal was fictitious from the beginning. It was heavily backloaded with the clear intent to trade him after a few years, and only one of the top spenders in the game could afford him, even when FLA was giving him away.
@CNNPolitics Are we sure he's going to be alive long enough to see the results? He's looking a bit skeletal. Big Emperor Palpatine vibe going on.
@ABC @rickklein I thought we respected the decision of voters, what with all the pomp and circumstance of "the importance of voting". Now it's we respect the decision unless we don't like it, in which case we label it racist and flawed?
@chaddukes @NBCSRN @Redskins @BurnedHat Amazing picture. Never seen the old man before.

@AdamSchefter Keep on drawing from the discard pile. I'm sure that's gonna work out great.
@TageRosendahl @AKinkhabwala @RapSheet That and running back by committee.
@steelcity1977 @AKinkhabwala @RapSheet Yes. However, I'm guessing it's unlikely they go that route. Better to trade him and get something in return than keep tagging him. But in theory, yes, he does not accrue a season of service time and thus his status tolls.
@AKinkhabwala @RapSheet Bell would be foolish to sit out the season. There is no way on earth a team gives him a contract large enough to make up for the $15MM he'd lose by sitting out the year.
@AKinkhabwala @RapSheet Terrible comp IMHO. The AAV of Gilbert's eventual deal ($6.6MM) was more than twice what the tag value was ($2.8MM). In this case, Bell's tag value (~$15MM) is basically equivalent to the AAV he'd get as a free agent.
@granthpaulsen More to the point: when you're 5-2, fixing those flaws starts to matter a whole lot more.
@RealDealBeal23 @dcsportsbog @Redskins We need two to make the Pick Six secondary.
@granthpaulsen But, we'll likely get a comp pick if he doesn't re-sign, so take that into account.
@granthpaulsen Like the player, need to see what we gave up. Contract's up after this season. I'd say a fourth or fifth rounder would be a decent value. Any more and I'd think less of the deal.
@CraigThompsonVT @EBJunkies Pretty sure most cases like these end up with a settlement, even when the university could try to argue the firing was for cause. Look at Art Briles - he got $15.1 million to walk away. Guessing Durkin wasn't amenable to that, therefore you either eat the total or keep him.
@EBJunkies Spot on, and people need to understand this is how the world works. Every business has a budget. Moral judgements are fine and dandy until the rubber meets the road and you have to come up with tens of millions of dollars you don't have.

@RapSheet yesssssssss!
@FredKatz Anyway, seriously, it is sort of an a-hole move to call someone an idiot so truly, I apologize. But I still think it‚Äôs slightly ridiculous to display any level of amazement with the Warriors being a ridiculously good team. At this point, we kinda know. Have a good night friendo.
@FredKatz ... and I thought I was super-smart and this guy just had every answer. All of that to say - I‚Äôve literally spent 2 decades arguing with people online about sports. I have no idea what that means, but it‚Äôs odd to think about some people having no notion of the pre-web era.
@FredKatz Actually, Fred, now this is making me laugh. How old are you? Because I‚Äôm 42 and I‚Äôve been arguing sports online since the Usenet days. I thought about it yesterday. I got into this nonsense online argument with Charles Board, this huge Wake Forest fan...
@AounJon @FredKatz But, hey, you want me to be the bigger man, sorry for calling you an idiot, Mr. Katz. God bless &amp; have a great rest of your life.
@AounJon @FredKatz Honestly, I don‚Äôt care at all, surely not enough to be upset. I just kinda can‚Äôt believe a verified-on-twitter media member goes defcon 1 I‚Äôm going to threaten your job for being called an idiot.
@FredKatz Sorry, I can‚Äôt let this go. Know what I did today? I helped solve a huge technical issue impacting the Internet. My employer was pleased. If you want to claim some sort of moral high ground because that‚Äôs me and you‚Äôre on Twitter accomplishing nothing, seek psychiatric help.
@FredKatz So, in summary: please, continue to engage. Tell me more about exactly when you made this amazing discovery - some are suggesting a Nobel prize is in order - that the Warriors are ‚Äúfairly good‚Äù. I‚Äôve not hear any other outlets reporting this.
@FredKatz @davidaldridgedc - your take on the thin-skinned Mr. Katz threatening my job? Perhaps a staff meeting is in order. I can tell you I‚Äôll not give you a dime while you employee people who can‚Äôt take good-natured ribbing.
@FredKatz And while we‚Äôre lobbing nonsense threats, I‚Äôm sure your employer would just love to know you‚Äôre attacking potential users to your site - especially those with disposable income who are in your target demo - with your terrible passive aggressive faux-bullying.
@FredKatz Congratulations, you‚Äôve learned to use LinkedIn. Please, I‚Äôd love for you to contact my employer. Hey, I‚Äôm not the one reporting that the Warriors are a really good NBA team. I actually innovate instead of mailing it in.
@FredKatz You‚Äôre just now noticing this? Idiot.
@CBSNews Sadly the dog is clearly a lot smarter than the owner.
@JasonLaCanfora So he can get cut as soon as the Vance Joseph era is over in a few months? Great call.

@BigLipRadio @chaddukes Fallout from last night's show. There was going to be a dysfunctional family friday redux but @oscarradio f'd it up by doing a bit and now it's been converted into a PHX trip. My take anyway. I would 3000% fly out to PHX for spring training and ol' Brad Fukes.
@chaddukes Spring training trip would be amazing.
@noybsk2017 @ABC Right? I mean, if you report the guy multiple times and he kills you, the police have to be liable, don‚Äôt they?

@Levi_crozier @BaldyNFL @Patriots @JOSH_GORDONXII @dallascowboys Right? They spent a first round pick on an arguably worse player than the @Patriots got free. This is how franchises succeed in the NFL - getting talent at cut-rate prices.
@BaldyNFL @Patriots @JOSH_GORDONXII @Browns should be kicking themselves. They let a valuable asset go for free to "send a message" or some such nonsense. Let this be a lesson: the @NFL is about talent, not morals. We like players to be good guys but ultimately winning trumps everything.
@SWOPBaltimore It's really a win for just about everyone. Sex workers would have legitimate employment. Men seeking the services of sex workers could go into nice businesses rather than back streets. The state gets tax revenue. Kids don't see sex workers on the street.
@SWOPBaltimore Let's just legalize it. Can you imagine the tax windfall from legal sex work? I bet it would be enough to make a huge difference. Plus, safer work conditions, benefits, etc for the workers.

@baltsunworld @RectorSun Or at the very least that half-ass term ‚Äúanalysis‚Äù. But news? I think not. It‚Äôs clear this is a polemic that endorses one view over another. Hey, I‚Äôm not a journalist, but this seems like a bit of a Trojan Horse masquerading as news. Which would be sad.
@baltsunworld @RectorSun This seems like opinion and not news, but it‚Äôs not marked as opinion. Am I missing something? Because a headline alleging fear and falsehoods seems journalistically questionable.
@ABC Wait - one side thought the other side had a good idea and co-opted it? Careful, folks... this is how bipartisanship starts.
@BuckyBrooks Also: was it really overvaluing the position? Or did @Giants *think* he had the right skills and just whiff on the evaluation? And I‚Äôm not sure which is worse: bad strategy or bad talent evaluation.
@BuckyBrooks And, I would suggest, an indictment of the draft failures of the @Giants in the same way. Reached for Flowers bc they ‚Äúneeded an OT‚Äù -&gt; Reached for Solder in FA -&gt; cycle repeats.
@CBSNews I find it laughable she declared her boycott of Super Bowl ads yesterday and today this. Methinks the pregnancy might have gotten in the way of the ads.

@AdamSchefter Le‚Äôveon Bell is a moron. He‚Äôs losing $7MM with his holdout. There‚Äôs no way he‚Äôs going to recoup that value on his next deal. @Steelersshould thank their lucky stars they‚Äôll cut out this team cancer.
@CNNPolitics Can you imagine how emasculating it must feel to file a whiny complaint about someone grabbing your phone? For Christ‚Äôs sake, this country produced John Wayne and THIS is what ‚Äúmanhood‚Äù has sunken to? Good lord. What a debacle.
@ABC I‚Äôll take it.
@MoveTheSticks @Chiefs Love your content DJ.
@MoveTheSticks @Chiefs But it really only makes sense for that select group of teams. This would be a disaster of a trade for a bad team because then you're giving up high first rounders. So, I would agree with you, but only under those circumstances. Only a very good team makes sense.
@MoveTheSticks True. But it has to be a team who's really doing well this year. If you're the @Chiefs I get it. You add PP for the playoff run and give up something like (you hope) #32 in 2019 and 2020 while adding the #33 pick in 2019 (or whatever). THAT would make some sense.
@MoveTheSticks It's two first-rounders who will be on well below market contracts for four years plus an option. You're not just getting two elite players for one. You're getting them at a substantially reduced pay scale.
@MoveTheSticks By the way, anyone who wants to debate trades should really bone up on MLB trades first. That's by far the league that has the best understanding of value. NFL commentators really misunderstand the value of young, cost-controlled players. It's not just two first rounders.
@MoveTheSticks That seems like a huge overpay. You're giving up 2 first rounders - an enormously valuable commodity - for the "right" to pay PP $15MM+ AAV on a new deal into his 30's. If it's a team like the Patriots who are expected to be very low in the draft, *maybe*.
@ABC Oh my god with the sky-is-falling nonsense. It's the height of delusion and narcissism to think this election is some sort of apocalyptic event. The country was fine under Mr. Obama, it's fine under Mr. Trump, and it'll continue to be fine no matter who gets elected.
@ABC "And by your healthcare, I mean the healthcare you get because wealthy people are paying for it". Let's get real, folks. If you pay virtually nothing for something and rely on the rich to subsidize it... is it really yours?
@RapSheet Good thing they drafted Fournette so he can constantly be injured instead of, say, a stud lineman.
@LiebeCody @ABC The top 1% of earners pay around 40% of the total share of income tax. I'd like to know what universe you're living in where taking from the rich in the form of taxes so we can give it to the poor is stealing.
@ABC I used to be an Obama fan, but I'm really re-thinking that. It's a flat-out lie to say the GOP wants to keep power and Dems don't. Both parties want to keep power, and to say otherwise is to lie to the American people.
@ABC You know, I bet every state is purging voter rolls now. It's called "maintaining an accurate set of data".
@CBSNews Boy, you really have to be delusional to say it's us versus the rich and *they're* the ones trying to divide us. When you get involved in class warfare, which - let's admit it, is 100% the Dem playbook for 2018 - and then call out the other party for division, you're a hypocrite.
@RapSheet That's a laughable comparison. Ridley has 3 years under contract at ~$3 million per year plus an option. He's far more valuable than Cooper. Jerry Jones is a bad GM. He loves his team and that's his weakness. He has zero ability to have patience. This is an enormous overpay.
@peter_king Thank goodness this season is proving the folly of the nonsense recent trend toward over-valuing RBs. Giants w/ Barkley? Terrible. Jags with Fournette? Trending down. Zeke? Starting to look average. You do not need an "elite RB" to win a Super Bowl.
@peter_king This is a ludicrous tweet. The Colts are 2-5. Season's just about over. And you want them to spend resources on a disgruntled old RB? Unless you're thinking they're going to extend him, in which case terrible idea. You can get a young back in the draft for far less.
@RapSheet So now they can sign Khalil Mack long term? Oh..... oh no. Oh nooooooooooo. Gruden will be fired before he's through half of his deal. Should never have come back. Game's passed him by.
@granthpaulsen Holy christ. They traded a first rounder for Cooper? Bwahaha! Idiots.
@BaldyNFL @Redskins I've never seen a run defense improve this much from one season to another. Credit must go to Jim Tomasula, who is as fine a DL coach as there is in the league IMHO.
@flySAA_US Christian (?) from your North American call center was super helpful this morning. Really impressed by your customer service. Thanks! Made it easy to select a seat for my @united @staralliance award flight on your fine airline.
@CNNPolitics This country was divided long before @realDonaldTrump was elected. Don't blame him. Blame us.
@chaddukes @BrocPlymin The fact this zilch is still employed in radio is a stain on the industry.
@EdwerderRFA @dallascowboys YOU GOT KOTWICA'D
@CNNPolitics ... and raising taxes.
Seriously: interview every front office in the game and ask them if they'd sign him mid-season. Find ONE. I bet you can't. And if you can't, then you're proven as a hack who's a sportswriter in name only.
@mikefreemanNFL I'm sure NFL teams love signing QBs who haven't played for years mid-season. Please do the world a favor and take your social justice crusade elsewhere. The notion of Kaep playing anywhere in the league right now is laughable.

@darrenrovell This is clearly Sidney Poitier.
@ABC It would be quicker to tell us who the NYAG isn't suing.
@DonGeronimoShow Not something you want to do all the time but as a one off it‚Äôs fantastic.
@granthpaulsen The intent of the rule is clear. A fan may not intentionally prevent a fielder from making a catch. Any other interpretation is nonsensical. Are we really expected to believe MLB has intentionally placed fans in an area where they aren‚Äôt allowed to catch a ball?
@ScottTeaker @BNightengale Hello, dumbass: the fan must REACH. Putting one‚Äôs hands out is not reaching. Reaching is leaning over the railing with your arm out as far as it can go. This fan simply put his hands in front of himself. That‚Äôs not a reach. Congrats on being completely wrong.
@CNNPolitics And that‚Äôs the crux of the problem. Neither tax hikes nor entitlement cuts are popular, so we end up in the worst of all worlds: low taxes and expensive entitlements.
@CNNPolitics We have two choices. Either we raise taxes by a huge amount and keep entitlements as-is or we keep taxes as-is and make huge cuts to entitlements. There is no third option.
@ABC Here‚Äôs the problem: mom let them out of the house with them. Responsible parents wouldn‚Äôt allow that.
@ABC Saudis need to come clean on this one. International community will not like what they did but at least they‚Äôd get a little credit for honesty rather than continuing to deny and stonewall.
@ABC Another thing I love about this: the ‚Äúhunting is an American tradition‚Äù argument. Slavery and mass murder of Native Americans was at one point tradition as well. Tradition is not a good justification in itself.
@MWTCanadian @ABC Please. Look at him with his foot on the giraffe. Look at his face. This is not about responsible wildlife management. This is a jackass who wants to show his friends how awesome he is. What a piece of shit.

@StacieMWheeler @Buster_ESPN Just in time for Halloween.
@nytimes It almost bends the mind. We‚Äôve gone from the Fair Housing act to some bizarre notion that government‚Äôs job is to alchemically ensure a ‚Äúproper‚Äù racial balance. Progress or regression? Seriously consideration has to be given to the latter.
@nytimes What if on every street we set aside one house for each race? Would that make you happy? This is a serious question.
@BBCWorld Another factoid: The ‚Äúno rules, just right‚Äù slogan of @Outback Steakhouse originated in 1981 when the company expanded to China, a nod to the country‚Äôs history of rejection of all rules. Prior to that, its slogan was ‚Äúholy shit we just fried a whole onion‚Äù.
@BBCWorld Little-known fact: board games manufactured in China have no rule books. That‚Äôs how little respect they have for the rules.
@BBCWorld Famously, the Chinese soccer team in the 1972 World Cup played a game with 15 men. Why? THEY PLAY BY THEIR OWN RULES.
@BBCWorld When China plays chess, it starts with throwing all of your pieces off the board. Why? THEY PLAY BY THEIR OWN RULES.
@BBCWorld China is the country equivalent of Martin Riggs.
@CBSNews PT Barnum was right. Anyone who has even a hint of interest ought to do some research. A lot of very smart people think Uber can never be profitable. This will go the Snap route. It'll be priced high since it's "cool" and then drop majorly within the first year.
@TheoSHK @JonHeyman @martinonyc Counterpoint: when you're the CEO of a terrible team, why would you spend valuable time on this nonsense? Shouldn't he be spending every second developing talent rather than wasting time on this?
@s2obed @JonHeyman @martinonyc Fine. He's a terrible CEO. Satisfied?
@nickydelta99 @MiamiHerald @mooretosay Because they're selling out games? Miami's the LAST team that should be worried about adding capacity. Jeter is in way over his head. Any second he spends on this nonsense is a waste. Spend the time on player development. If/when he can field a winning team, THEN do this.
@JonHeyman @martinonyc Jeter is going to be remembered as a terrible GM. Great player, ZERO experience relevant to being a GM. Should never have been hired. Case in point: should you really be thinking about adding on SRO capacity when no one shows up at your games as-is?
@greggrosenthal Is it even possible to cancel a Twitter show?
@Brett_McMurphy I'd love to know what the Big 12 proposes as a mechanism to stop fans from storming the field. Anything you build, people will get around, unless it's legitimately high fencing, in which case you risk mass deaths from people pushing up against it.
@Rick_Ling1 @CNNPolitics Agree, but I think it's more about setting him up for a job that could get him closer. He's got to get a House/Senate seat or a governorship before he can be considered a legit candidate for the White House.
@CNNPolitics He's completely unqualified for the job. Aside from being HUD secretary for a few years - not exactly what you'd call a steppingstone job to the presidency - the highest level of government he's worked in is mayor of San Antonio.
@tw0st3p @cnnbrk Good day. I'd like to pass along a message from the Universe. It states: "You're a huge asshole".
@RobertJauregui7 @cnnbrk Ha! Good luck with that. They've already chewed up and spit out two interim CEOs. You'd have to be insane to take that job. If there's even one thing the horde finds that they don't like about you, you'll be eaten alive and fired.
@TheReal_EmTeeAy @RapSheet Yes, yes, yes. Had Brady thrown the ball, he gets flagged. There's no more obvious damned if you do, damned if you don't situation. Let him go and he scores. Sack him and if he's already thrown the ball you get a roughing the passer penalty. Vincent's reply is laughable.
@ZsdrftyDoe @RapSheet +1. His only role is to legitimize the NFL's nonsense by making it come out of a former player's mouth instead of an owner or Goodell.
@RapSheet ... but then you might get penalized. The NFL can't have it both ways. If you want to let players play, you gotta stop all of the nonsense "player safety" fines and penalties. And by the way, anyone who thinks Vincent does anything is crazy. He's just a mouthpiece for the NFL.
@darrenrovell RIP He Hate Me.
@JonHeyman Because hiring a retread GM worked out so well last time for the @Orioles.
@JonHeyman Orioles, as usual, undone by their own skinflint nature. Clear they're bargain-hunting. Ng's been mentioned as a GM candidate forever; O's clearly hoping they can potentially get her at a deep discount. Hot names will cost more.

We get kicked out. That's it. The justice system is already overburdened with actual crimes. Let's not further weigh it down with a nonsense case.
@DeSmokeMonster @theJSteinmetz @Russnevich @Noah_Sayed529 @GarrettM2013 @Real_M_Takacs @AdamSchefter "Toxic behavior"? Really? Beer has been thrown at games for decades. I suggest Mr. Hill dry himself off with the millions he's making on his rookie contract rather than tracking down some drunken idiot who's already been banned from the stadium.
@AdamSchefter Terrible look. Hill is on a 4 year/$2.5 million contract. While that's not a lot in NFL terms, it's a lot for a regular person, and I think most regular folks would say if you're earning that much, you ought to be able to make your way through a beer dousing or two.

@CNNPolitics Up to a week, not a week.
@Jm09wvu @cnnbrk Of course not, but that's not what this is about. It's about giving the uncertain GOP votes a more solid basis to make their decision.
@all4feets @cnnbrk No. He said his family had been through hell and clearly didn't want any further delay, but he didn't say it was a deal-breaker (in fact, he very clearly stated nothing would cause him to withdraw).
@the_up4 @cnnbrk The vote tomorrow is a procedural one, not the final vote.
@trey_vet @CNNPolitics There is zero chance an FBI investigation will definitively settle anything. All they're going to report back is what people told them. It's a background check, not an investigation. But I agree - smart to delay. It'll give Collins/Flake/Murkowski more support for voting yes.
@NateSilver538 Nate, I'd love to see something about what a potential FBI (re)investigation would look like. Who can ask for/order it? What happens? How do they report the results? Lots of calling for an FBI investigation but not much about how it would actually happen in practice.
@ABC Anyone else think we ought to just move all of the women to one half of the country and all of the men to the other half and abandon any pretense of the sexes getting along?
@NateSilver538 I think that's what's being lost here. The "call for an FBI investigation" crowd seems to think somehow the FBI will declare someone right and someone wrong. They won't. They'll just gather reports from witnesses and give them to the committee.
@NateSilver538 I'm not sure the FBI has any grounds to conduct an investigation. It's not within their jurisdiction to conduct a criminal investigation and they already have statements from most, if not all, of the parties. That's where it ends. They report back what people said.
@ABC I feel like this is a statement we can all agree with.
@ABC And the kabuki theater continues.
@JakeWaltonSD @perrybaconjr I agree 1000%. She's hoping Manchin will be a yes.
@CNNPolitics Please, with the histrionics. We're having elections in November. If Dems win the Senate, they can do what they want. That's how it works. Elections matter. You win them, you get to do what you want.
@NateSilver538 I mean, seriously. Compare this to any other job. Do we ask the Terminix guy whether he drank too much as a kid? Of course not. As long as he gets rid of the bugs, he's awesome. So too with a SCOTUS seat. What we care about: his performance as a judge. Nothing else matters.
@NateSilver538 I'm an independent. I couldn't care less about Kavanaugh's drinking. We seem to be forgetting that the entire point of this process is to put a good justice on the SCOTUS. Any fair review of his tenure on the COA DC Circuit shows he's well qualified as a judge.
@ABC It's 2018. EVERYTHING is nakedly political.
@amyklobuchar Please run for president in 2020. I had abandoned all hope of a nominee I could proudly vote for until I saw you today. We need your ability to build relationships &amp; focus on solutions rather than spouting rhetoric. Thanks!
@TheKurtFuller @Auburnite @Psych_USA @nbcsvu Kurt, I want to party with you.
@cnnbrk Completely inappropriate.
@granthpaulsen Accurate take.
@dcsportsbog A, nation transfixed = where‚Äôs B? A nation, transfixed = obvious A nation transfixed, = and then what?
@dcsportsbog Surely they could have moved the comma around to keep it interesting.
@NateSilver538 I thought the timing worked. Having the GOP sens go full bore the whole time would have been too much.
@CNNPolitics I would vote Klobuchar for president. She comes across as thoughtful and nonpartisan, unlike those who are clearly just grandstanding for their upcoming presidential bids like Booker and Harris.
@ABC If looks could kill....
@ABC He's right - it sets a terrible precedent. Every nomination from now on will involve collecting negative information about the nominee and deploying it at just the right time to derail the nomination. Is this really what we want?
@WSJ I want to move to an island of dull, apolitical competence. Where is this island located?
@FiveThirtyEight This is 2018 in a nutshell. White men on one side, everyone else on the other.
@NateSilver538 Her job is clearly not to discredit Dr. Ford. Any idiot can see that. Her job is to get Dr. Ford's testimony without being perceived as being demeaning or otherwise unfriendly to Dr. Ford. That's it. That is her sole purpose.
@RapSheet What a dumpster fire. We're asking officials to make judgement calls about whether or not a player attempted to move to the side a few inches? It's ludicrous on its face.
@ABC He's running.
@NateSilver538 One out of nowhere possibility: Kavanaugh admits to being a recovering alcoholic. He says yes, I had a problem, and I dealt with it. I've been sober &lt;x&gt; years. I didn't want to admit this because I consider it to be a private matter. Now he becomes somewhat sympathetic as well.
@NateSilver538 ... assaulting her, he cannot categorically exclude the possibility he drank enough to black out and could have done it without remembering it. I think this could be enough cover for GOP holdouts to say he wasn't lying, which is the big hurdle he has to clear.
@NateSilver538 It'll be interesting to see how the Kavanaugh questioning goes. At this point I think a flat denial is a no-go. Ford's testimony was credible. I think the only way for him to move forward is to admit to heavy drinking at the time and say that while he has no memory of...
@NateSilver538 Le sigh.
@chaddukes @RodKast @erolsvideo This is your greatest tweet of all time. God bless you real good.
@CNNPolitics Tomorrow is going to be brutal for Kavanaugh. Sens like Hirono, Harris, et al are just going to tee off on him. Really curious to see how hard they go after his drinking.
@LATimesfarmer Added see a game at the Rose Bowl to my (not yet in existence) bucket list. Crazy to see how it‚Äôs just sort of chilling in the suburbs (although it sometimes seems LA is nothing but).
@MarkZuckerman Hey, I had a great Nats moment this year. Saw Soto‚Äôs first MLB HR (actual chronology, not revisionist) from the Diamond Club.
@MarkZuckerman At this point I‚Äôd be shocked not to see him re-signed. They clearly want him back, he clearly wants to be here, and that‚Äôs how a deal gets done quickly.
@nytimes I really believe she‚Äôs telling the truth and he blacked out and has no memory of it. It‚Äôs like a game of chicken. The only reason they‚Äôre still heading toward the collision is that both believe they‚Äôre right.
@MarkZuckerman I believe they‚Äôll sign him for 10 years and $300 million. They clearly want him back and I cannot think of a team that would pay more. Also, that would be a relative value compared to the $400MM+ he was apparently seeking prior to this year.
@ABC #NoteGate
@ABC NoteGate is real.
@itsJeffTiedrich @nytimes .. but that just isn't so. I submit there is no way to prove whether Kavanaugh did or didn't do it.
@itsJeffTiedrich @nytimes Do you really think an investigation would yield anything of value? We're talking about kids at beer parties 30 years ago. Memory's not great 3 decades later, particularly when you were drinking at the time. It seems to me there's this notion that somehow the truth is out there..
@nytimes IMHO worst thing Dems could do is badger Kav on lifestyle questions - especially alcohol. I think there's a real chance that could give the GOP ammo to characterize this as a witch hunt. "Democrats aren't interested in what happened, they're interested in making him look bad".
@DoubleDeuce @TreasureH1984 @AP But they are kinda conflating drinking with sexual assault. Sort of like a "well, we all know what goes on at these parties" where when you admit to drinking at a house party, it's construed as a tacit admission that at a minimum you're complicit in rape culture.
@archerology @AP Is this really the litmus test we want to impose on nominees? To not be human? Shall we start asking about how many times they've exceeded the speed limit? It's ludicrous.
@athm99 @NateSilver538 God bless you for trying, though.
@singlepayer @NateSilver538 It‚Äôs true. In a blackout, you continue to act volitionally but have no memory of it. Passing out is falling asleep. That‚Äôs what I learned from @drdrew on Loveline anyway.
@TakesontheRight @FiveThirtyEight He gets confirmed, Dems use him in the midterms. That‚Äôs the point. If they were able to confirm someone else pre-midterms, they could nullify that. But I think the GOP is confident sticking with him will play to their base. We shall see.
@aagcobb @saletan IIRC he said he never got so drunk he doesn‚Äôt remember what he did. You don‚Äôt remember blacking out. Really only know when other ppl tell you. So, if he passed out 1k times and blacked out once, and doesn‚Äôt know he blacked out, then he wasn‚Äôt lying.
@anofiscal @saletan In the current climate, Jesus Christ would not be confirmed. They‚Äôd hear the talk about water into wine and vote him down straightaway. Oh, this Jesus! they‚Äôd say. A bootlegger! Loaves and fishes? Clearly this man is mentally ill. Away with him!
@Brandossius @saletan What if he woke up in the morning assuming he passed out &amp; fell asleep when he actually blacked out &amp; did what he‚Äôs accused of? If he truly believes he went to sleep, he‚Äôs actually not lying. That is how every single person in this story can be telling the truth.
@saletan That said, the ‚Äúhe was too drunk to remember‚Äù theory is a great one. Assume that‚Äôs where we end up. Does he end up confirmed? I say yes. I don‚Äôt think the GOP is going to break just because Kavanaugh admits to binge mdrinking in his HS/college years. But Dems will hammer him.
@saletan This is such a ridiculous article. How can a professional writer express befuddlement and shock that college kids binge drink? It‚Äôs common. It‚Äôs the norm. Nothing about what‚Äôs being described will shock anyone who went to college in the past few decades.
@ABC Weird the husband's not with her. I get the sinking feeling he's involved.
@nytimes GaRonKeith.
@nytimes It cannot possibly be news to one of the great newspapers on Earth that teenage boys are often mean, sex-obsessed, and like to drink. It‚Äôs as if in 2018 we somehow forgot how humans actually behave. Teen boys have done this, are doing this, and will do this. Period.

@nowthisnews DOES ANYONE KNOW WHERE I CAN BUY A WALL MOUNT MAP OF THE LEVELS
@LATimesfarmer Funny but unsettling.
@ABC Like - they literally cannot investigate this, an alleged state crime. They don‚Äôt have jurisdiction.
@ABC Straight from https://t.co/Jt9U5UX9Vx: The FBI has special investigative jurisdiction to investigate violations of state law in limited circumstances, specifically felony killings of state law enforcement officers, violent crimes against interstate travelers, and serial killers.
@QuintinSTodd @CNNPolitics Not really. Practically speaking, either they vote on him straightaway or he withdraws. Zero chance POTUS/Senate wait for a report. She‚Äôs risking nothing.

@darrenrovell Shouldn't "sacrificed everything" only be applied to the dead? I mean, if you're still alive, how can you possibly have sacrificed everything? I think about GIs freezing in foxholes with bullets whizzing by them and I think, compared to them, Kaep hasn't sacrificed much.
@darrenrovell I find it sadly ironic that these guys, who no doubt are out there working in the hot sun for modest pay, are putting up an ad for a guy who earned tens of millions in the NFL yet claims to have sacrificed everything.

@PNW_Hawk @darrenrovell But why would Kaep appeal to kids? You have hundreds of guys actually playing on Sundays. I cannot imagine Kaep appeals more to them than Gurley, Brown, et al.
@darrenrovell Businesswise, it's an odd decision. For a niche brand, OK - gets you on the map. For a global brand - why would you risk alienating ~40% of the population? The upside cannot be worth that.
@seimicke23 @PriscoCBS Very valuable because they're close enough to the top of the draft to be talented but they'll have low salaries for the first 4 years. Huge difference in rookie deals between Barkley and Hunt. So yeah, you're not going to hit on every one, but when you do, they're valuable.

@oshunj @jehawks @FiveThirtyEight @NateSilver538 Alaska? It‚Äôs a giant icebox. Really better than Florida? Be honest.
@FiveThirtyEight @NateSilver538 So that‚Äôs the question, @NateSilver538: does the ‚Äúyou can never leave‚Äù clause apply to the random states as well? Can‚Äôt really answer until we know that.
@FiveThirtyEight @NateSilver538 Or, Hawai‚Äôi (if you love the cold) or Alaska (if you hate the cold) or Montana (if you love big cities). Plus, size matters. Even if you don‚Äôt love Florida, at least there‚Äôs a lot of it. The ‚Äúcan never leave‚Äù clause really has some teeth.
@FiveThirtyEight @NateSilver538 It has to be Florida. Random has a lot of risks. What if you get Rhode Island? Then you can never leave it, and it‚Äôs tiny.
@EdBouchette It'd be fun if the fine was proportional to the player's weight.
@CBSNews I love how TI is viewed as some sort of moral authority given his jail terms, unpaid taxes, arrests, children with 3 different women, etc.
@CBSNews I feel like this is a chance to unite as a country. No matter your political affiliation, color, religion, etc, we can all agree we detest murdering pieces of garbage like this guy and Chris Watts. Hey, we can all agree on something. It's a start.
@keelingover @CBSNews And how. I can't see any way Trump survives with Cohen's admission he paid Daniels at Trump's direction. It's a smoking gun. Congress might be able to overlook some things. This one? I can't see it.
@cnnbrk White collar crime just doesn't match up to murder. Sorry. We can get money back from Cohen and Manafort. We can't get Shannan Watts + 2 kids + Mollie Tibbetts back. Ever. Those are the crimes you ought to care about.
@cnnbrk It feels weird to me that so many people are invested in Manafort/Cohen and not in Chris Watts and whoever killed Mollie Tibbetts. Manafort/Cohen might be dirtbags, but it was only about $. Chris Watts killed his pregnant wife and 2 kids. Someone killed Mollie Tibbetts.
@ABC Bet it's 8 not guilty. There were 4 charges of failing to file foreign bank accounts and 4 charges of bank fraud = the 8 they can agree on. Unlikely to be guilty since there were 5 charges of bank fraud conspiracy and if you find him guilty of bank fraud, should be conspiracy too
@teaandmagnolias @ABC If your wife is leaving, it's terribly wrong, but I can understand that a person could snap at that instant and kill. You're 99.999% evil, but at least there's a tiny shred of humanity that realized after the fact you did evil. Putting your cold dead kids in barrels = 100% evil.
@teaandmagnolias @ABC Can you imagine? I mean, if I try really, really hard I can kinda see how in a moment of rage you do something terrible. It's evil, but at least I can sort of understand. Putting your kids in oil barrels in cold blood? That's beyond the pale. That is pure evil.
@Letstwistthis @ABC And seriously, think about this. Even if that story were true (we all know it isn't)... you call the police, right? You see your wife strangling your children, it's a call to 911 straightaway. It's a pointless lie. That's how you know a pathological liar. They lie for no reason.
@LrShrimp @ABC Not his lawyer. This is how narcissistic psychopaths behave. Even when confessing, he can't bring himself to be honest. He has to shift the blame. It was HER fault he did it, because he just cannot accept the idea he's a piece of shit.
@chamomile1972 @ABC We already know the truth. She packed a bag and was leaving with the kids. They found that packed bag in the house. He didn't want them to leave, he killed the wife, then had to kill the kids to cover it all up. That's how this always happens.
@madorairene @ABC The guy is a first rate piece of human garbage. He's already admitting to killing his wife and her unborn child. Why not just come clean about everything? At this point, what does he have to gain? He's getting either death or life in prison for what he confessed to.
@ABC I mean, seriously, think about that. Think about how cold-blooded a person you have to be to murder your whole family and then stare into a camera and say you didn't do it and you're hoping they will come home safe. This guy makes Scott Peterson look like a nice guy.
@ABC And what's really scary is the interview he gave after they "disappeared" but before he confessed. Go watch that. Killing your wife and kids is basically the worst thing as a human you can do, UNLESS you then lie about it and say "I have no idea what happened".
@ABC Dude, you're admitting to killing your wife and her unborn child. Why not just admit to everything? You're either going to be put to death or spend your life in prison for that alone. Literally the least you can do is be honest about what went down.

@CBSNews Isn't the logical response to hold these countries responsible for their utter inability to ensure the safety of their citizens? They're the source of the problem. Why is there global outage about US immigration policy and none about the countries actually causing the problem?

@RyanDivish Why do we expect humans to be able to accurately judge plays like that? Given that every MLB game is broadcast, shouldn‚Äôt we use video to adjudicate every play? I don‚Äôt understand the slavish adherence to the notion human umpires should have a role.
@RyanDivish This is fantastic theater.
@Buster_ESPN Is there any legitimate argument to having machines call balls and strikes? They can do it better.

@Harleyquinn1127 @ABC Since you have a useful perspective: what would you expect a school to do should an autistic child be physically out of control? What‚Äôs the right thing to do? Is there some consensus as to the best practices for handling this?

@CNNPolitics The best strategy would be not to feed the trolls and ignore their nonsense protests. When folks go out and counter-protest, all they do is put themselves on the same low level as these idiots.

@drumaximus @CNNPolitics Agree 100%.
@CNNPolitics I've got no problem subsidizing, say, a computer science degree. That's a needed skill. A sensible plan would be to subsidize based on what society needs. Want to get a STEM degree? It's free. Something that isn't in demand, you pay. Great way to steer people toward careers.
@CNNPolitics $15 an hour national minimum wage is nonsensical, first off. $15 an hour is a whole lot in some parts of the country and poverty wages in others. It's got to be adjusted based on cost of living. Free college? We ought to be subsidizing every degree no matter its worth?
@CNNPolitics Well, I can finally abandon the Democratic party and officially become an independent. Two extreme parties means no sane party.

@RyanDivish I quit watching. Hard to watch a team that just seems to be going through the motions. Then again, why would they put out any effort for a city that can‚Äôt even be bothered to show up? You let Jays fans invade your house, this is what you deserve.

@WSJ Action is clearly needed to stop the murders in which 3D printed guns were involved. What‚Äôs that? They used actual guns? Shocking.
@CNNPolitics I mean, seriously, what should we be more concerned about? 3D printed guns, which AFAIK have never been involved in anything, or pressure cooker bombs, which have actually been used to kill people? There are literally thousands of things more relevant than 3D printed guns.
@CNNPolitics 3D printed guns are not an issue. Does anyone really think criminals will 3D print guns when real guns are easily available? This is just an issue around which each party can rally their base. It has no real-world impact.
@BryanDFischer @Brett_McMurphy Really, why does it matter? Urban‚Äôs a phenomenally successful coach. If Ohio State fires him for cause, someone else will hire him. I guarantee you a bottom-dweller SEC school would hire him in a heartbeat. Take some short-term heat in exchange for a HoF coach.
@Hammer__D @darrenrovell @Jaboowins @NFL Yeah - why hasn‚Äôt he been put to death yet?
@darrenrovell Smart men should avoid women altogether. Better safe than sorry.
@BobLeyESPN @BenReiter Social media doesn't care about that, of course, because their goal is to get their pound of flesh, not to actually do something about the problem by helping the person become better. All they know is utter exile. Leagues are making a mistake by kowtowing to the horde.
@BobLeyESPN @BenReiter It's very simple. Think about it like a church. Does a church reject someone who's made mistakes? Of course not, as long as they're willing to learn and grow. So too with a team. You take on Osuna to let that strong clubhouse help him learn and grow.
@RyanDivish I like the cut of this Maybin fellow's jib.

@fabrizzio_182 @RyanDivish Yes. No one will take on Cano's contract. Still owed 5 years at $24MM.

@JonHeyman Nice return for the Angels IMHO.
@RyanDivish Wheeler and a whole lot of mediocrity.
@granthpaulsen Not sure it matters. This incarnation of the team has gone as far as it can. Time to reload.
@granthpaulsen How about a top catching prospect? Seems like that‚Äôs another big area of need.
@RyanDivish Any word on when today‚Äôs bullpen additions will be available?
@RussTop3Ever @RyanDivish Mariners would be in the playoffs if the season ended today. You can keep preaching doom and gloom or enjoy the ride. I recommend the latter.
@RussTop3Ever @RyanDivish Santana has barely played this year. Cannot depend on him for the stretch run. Ross is not great. The only SP he‚Äôd upgrade would be Felix. Meanwhile all of the relief arms are no-doubt upgrades.
@RyanDivish I know you know that, but fans seem to think there‚Äôs some magical trove of prospects in the system that we don‚Äôt know about.
@RyanDivish They don‚Äôt have the prospects to get a top SP, period. The current strategy of shoring up the bullpen is the best tactic.
@RyanDivish üé∂ Old Ben Gamel got a hit, E-I-E-I-O üé∂

@lifesyourcup @DhaSickest By the way, if Guice can be a good route runner, the sky is the limit for the Skins offense. Alex Smith loves throwing to backs and TEs. Jordan Reed could have a career year if he can stay healthy.

@mezcal151 @RapSheet I agree 100%. Signing him to a long-term deal is a no-brainer. I just get the feeling that like @LeVeonBell he wants a seismic shift in positional value. If so, that‚Äôs going to make negotiations tough. Few teams want to be the ones to dramatically reshape the market.
@mcuban Oh, Mark, please. We know you‚Äôre peerless.
@EveHammond13 @NateSilver538 That's what people forget. Election meddling was just one part of a larger campaign to sow discord in the US, and you need look no farther than @Twitter to confirm they succeeded beyond their wildest imagination.
@mezcal151 @RapSheet You have no idea what Mack's camp is demanding. If it's a little more than Von Miller money, OK, bite the bullet and sign him. But if they want, say, $100 million fully guaranteed, that's different. That's a market reset, not "pay the man".
@SportsHackCA @RapSheet Not if he wants to reset the market, which I'm guessing is the case. He's not going to get close to elite QB money. That's just a fact of positional value in today's NFL.
@RapSheet Why are these contract negotiations difficult? Von Miller's already set the bar for elite EDGE players. Is there any reason the two sides don't just take that deal, add on a little bit to account for inflation, and sign on the dotted line?
@Medium @umairh I mean, christ, with these attitudes, here's what you get. Moon? Too far. D-Day? Too complex. Hoover Dam? Too big. When exactly did we endorse a change in national attitude from "get it done" to "hey, it's OK, it's someone else's problem to fix"?
@Medium @umairh This is a nonsense article. Being unable to afford things != scarcity. The whining epitomized by this article infuriates me. Find a way. 4 yr college too much? Go to a CC. Apt too expensive? Add roommates. Millennials ought to focus on solutions rather than problems.

@SethAbramson No one cares. This is a 10/10 for wonks/Dems and a 0/10 for those who voted for Trump. And the hyper-partisan beat goes on....

@UpshotNYT @FiveThirtyEight Great but depressing article. I‚Äôm a centrist forced to choose between two increasingly polarized parties. It‚Äôs really a no-win situation.
@BuckyBrooks Wonder if those guys will see less between the tackle usage after the üí∞.  Convinced that‚Äôs what makes RB a short career. Do you want Gurley pounding the rock 20-30 times a game when you‚Äôre tied to him for 6 years?
@AdamSchefter Clearly they're lowballing Donald - that's the only way it would drag on this long. Seems odd to give Gurley a deal that almost doubles the market while trying to sign Donald on the cheap. Not sure Snead understands NFL positional value.
@CNNPolitics Sadly, there's zero chance this gets fixed any time soon. The only fix will come from bipartisan action in Congress, and that's something that basically doesn't exist right now. Get ready for years of this.
@MarcelZone @BuckyBrooks @LeVeonBell Fair enough, and the Rams can afford it since Goff's on a rookie deal. Still, I question doing it now. Does anyone really think the market for elite RBs will go much higher than $15MM? There just doesn't seem to be a compelling reason to do it other than spending money.
@NateSilver538 ... almost as if we're all entrenched in our views and nothing will change them.
@MarcelZone @BuckyBrooks @LeVeonBell You're making my point for me. If you can dramatically improve an offense by adding all of that new talent, none of which IIRC was paid top of market... doesn't that say you're much better off spreading the money around than concentrating it in a RB?
@BucBall38 @BuckyBrooks @LeVeonBell That's not a great way to look at it. He was under contract for 2 years @ $7MM AAV. They extended it for 4 years @ $15MM AAV. Overall AAV doesn't matter. It's one thing to set the market. It's another to almost double it, particularly when they could have waited a year.
@gurnek47 @BuckyBrooks @LeVeonBell Because WRs are more valuable as measured by salary. The WR franchise tag value is 1.34 times more than the RB salary. I know Bucky predicts a seismic shift in the RB market, and maybe he's right, but until then NFL dollars say WR is a more valuable position.
@BuckyBrooks @LeVeonBell Bucky, I love you, but coaching and system are everything. Gurley was pedestrian until McVay rolled into town. He didn't magically become transcendent on his own. Good player, but look at history. Virtually all SB winners past 2 decades: elite QB and good, not great, RBs.
@MarcelZone @mortreport @RamsNFL Winning in today's NFL: get a great QB, give him a great OL and defense, give him about 8 good playmakers, make the defense cover 5 of them on every play, and win with playcalling. It's all about playmaker depth. Paying top dollar for a RB works against that.
@MarcelZone @mortreport @RamsNFL It's possible. Chris Johnson got a $53MM deal in 2011. There are dumb teams out there. All I'm saying is - look at who wins championships. It's not the teams who have high priced RBs. That NFL is gone, and Zeke/Bell/Johnson/Barkley don't change that.
@MarcelZone @mortreport @RamsNFL In the past 2 decades, anyway. Might some team give Bell $15MM a year? Perhaps. That doesn't make it a good idea. The NFL hasn't dramatically changed. Get a good QB, keep him upright, surround him with solid playmakers, and play great on defense. That's how you hoist the trophy.
@MarcelZone @mortreport @RamsNFL Just like the Adrian Peterson deal reset the market, right? Oh wait, it didn't, because teams realized QBs, OL, and defense win championships. History proves it. Virtually every Super Bowl winning team has a QB with a HOF resume and a solid running back by committee.
@ro_503_ @mortreport @RamsNFL The Gurley/Cooks extensions are nonsensical. They doubled the market price for a RB. Basically indefensible to do that. And Cooks? What the f has he done to merit a mega-deal? Guy's a good, not great, player. McVay's a fantastic coach. Snead, not a very good GM.
@MarcelZone @mortreport @RamsNFL Smart? You're legitimately calling giving a RB a contract with twice the AAV of any other RB in the league smart? Note how teams that win Super Bowls don't do that. They invest in QB, OL, and defense.
@mortreport @RamsNFL That doesn't make the dollars spent on Gurley/Cooks reasonable. Donald deserves a mega-deal. Gurley? Product of the McVay system. Cooks? Journeyman. Didn't need to break the bank on them. It'll come back to bite them in a few years.
@JustinLewen @MisterMedia24 @greggrosenthal Because he had Sean McVay running the offense. Sean McVay is transcendent. Gurly's just reaping the benefits. Good back, but I question whether doubling the going rate for a RB is anywhere close to fiscally sensible.
@Ckrawl @greggrosenthal ... or the rest of the league. Just about every QB who's won a  Super Bowl in the past 2 decades has a legit hall of fame resume. RBs? Since Faulk in 1999, only Jamal Lewis, Corey Dillon, and maybe Marshawn Lynch are anywhere close.
@Hulen97 @greggrosenthal @steelers The Steelers won two Super Bowls with Willie Parker toting the rock. No matter how much personalities want to drum up "the return of the RB", history shows you don't need an elite back to win a championship.
@greggrosenthal Nonsense. The last time a truly transcendent RB won a Super Bowl was Faulk in 1999. Actual data - not hot takes - says a solid RBBC wins you championships. Because if transcendent RBs were worth a lot, they'd be hoisting Lombardi trophies.
@CNBC @darrenrovell If bonuses are based on company-wide performance, there‚Äôs no reason to excel. Low performers get the same as high performers. Bet you‚Äôll see a talent exodus from Nike as a result.
@DaveBautista @JamesGunn God bless you, Dave. You are so right and thank you for defending your friend.
@Comic_Con Any #RehireJamesGunn chants occurring in the hallways yet?
@Marvel folks running their Twitter should probably report up the chain that #RehireJamesGunn is shooting up like a roman candle.
@BinkTheMagician @prattprattpratt Not just solidarity. GOTG was the movie that broke him to the masses. @prattprattpratt you owe him. Let's get an endorsement from you to #RehireJamesGunn
@shawnxmadden How about everyone #BoycottMarvel until they re-hire him?
#BoycottMarvel until they re-hire @JamesGunn let‚Äôs go ppl. Cut off the $.
@EricVespe Also, isn‚Äôt the solution here an easy one? No one buy anything Marvel-related until he‚Äôs hired back. A huge quarterly dip in profits is guaranteed to change their minds.
@EricVespe Staggeringly bad business decision. Keep Gunn, keep $ rolling in. Fire him and ... what? Shut up the lunatic fringe who never posed a threat of any consequence to your business?
@pattonoswalt I pine for the halcyon days when men had the common decency to be alcoholics rather than engaging in mean-spirited Machiavellian twitter plots.
@RapSheet @NFLTotalAccess Perfect solution: donate the fine to social justice organizations. Mission accomplished.
@castrovince Save room on the futon for Kawhi.
@NicoleAuerbach Someone give me one reason why this is a story. Does anyone really care, or is this just a desperate attempt to make something out of nothing? Because to me it's a complete non-story. Football coach wants players to hit each other, film at 11.
@ZachLowe_NBA I'm starting to think TOR acquired him to deal him elsewhere. That would make a lot of sense. Spurs really couldn't negotiate at arm's length with LAL given the baggage. TOR can now make a rational, emotion-free deal with LAL to get Kawhi there.
@Atsxxz @HOOPSabstract @ZachLowe_NBA Then you get Kawhi + LeBron a year early. Pretty obvious. Were I LAL, I'd already be on the horn with TOR. Kawhi has far more value to LAL than TOR. TOR moved DeRozan's salary. Why not acquire young players/picks from LAL rather than deal with the Kawhi headache?
@BuckyBrooks Because PIT was willing to pay $15MM AAV when that's twice what any other RB makes.
@chaddukes @funnydanny someone needs to snap up @stinkydanny and start a bit
@abw22 @SeanDeveney @sportingnews The entire world knows Kawhi wants to go to LA. Why on earth would he confirm he'd play a year in Toronto when he doesn't want to go there? The trade clearly factors in that possibility. If he skips the year, DeRozan's contract is off the books and they can reload in free agency.
@blarney27 @SeanDeveney But he can very easily do the same thing he did in San Antonio: have "his team" diagnose an injury and say he's not 100%. Then he's not "sitting out", he's "injured". Stays on IR the entire year, then signs with LA as a free agent.
@SMONTEZ99 @RodneyG1234 @HartCillian16 @nathanpf1 @tomhaberstroh Bingo. At this point it's more or less a fact. He wanted to go to LA, coming back would have meant risking injury and thus tanking his trade value, therefore he sat out the season. He deserves this. Quitting on your team merits banishment to Toronto.
@RodneyG1234 @HartCillian16 @nathanpf1 @tomhaberstroh Get with reality. It's widely known he wants to go to LA. His "injury" lingered for way too long. Which is more likely: he wanted to play for the Spurs but couldn't, or didn't want to play and get injured, thus tanking his trade value? Clearly the latter.
@RodneyG1234 @nathanpf1 @tomhaberstroh His problem wasn't physical, it was mental. He decided he wanted to force a trade to LA. Everyone knows he could have played, but then he's risking injury and tanking his trade value. He fully deserves what he's getting.
@YAWKYAWK @SpursBros @RodneyG1234 @nathanpf1 @tomhaberstroh At this point it's basically accepted fact that his uncle wanted to steer him to LA and decided the best way to do that was to find an outside doctor who would recommend he sit out the season. He quit on his team to force a trade, period.
@tomhaberstroh Well, he quit on his team and sat out basically the whole season to force a trade, so let's call it even, shall we?
@sonsofbeast @flaax @Espngreeny People don't appreciate how much of a toxic "asset" Kawhi was. That he's thinking about sitting out the season tells you everything. A guy who will sit out basically 2 straight seasons as a tantrum is not a guy you want on your team.
@Any2Cards302 @Espngreeny You blow it up, you probably lose Pop, who's one of the greatest coaches in league history. The rebuild can and should wait until he retires.
@Espngreeny Amen. They'll have Pop + a competitive team in 2018-2019, and that always means a ray of hope. Burn it all down, Pop's gone, and you're in full rebuild mode.
@adamcarolla Sandwich. No remaining stick to deal with.
@NateSilver538 But X is near-zero. Already rumors he doesn't want to play in Toronto, he's expressed a desire to play in LA, and LA's got LeBron. What's the argument against this take? If he cared about max money he'd have re-signed with the Spurs.
@PawSox @hotwieners_401 Any idea when new Hot Wieners jerseys will be back in stock?
@joonlee Stop treating all bad tweets as "you must go away forever". Let the punishment fit the crime. Under 18 versus 30? Different. One-time versus repeated? Different. Sometimes the person ought to disappear, sometimes an apology will suffice. Context is everything.
@joonlee And really, the same with how we treat things above 18. You look at the mitigating factors (e.g. a hot-blooded response, a one-time thing) versus the aggravating factors (e.g. repeated things) and arrive at a decision. Ultimately, what's the conclusion?
@joonlee We already have a model for that: the legal system. Under 18? You get treated differently. Don't overthink this. If we're going to treat a kid differently, for, say, vandalism, so too with bad tweets.
@ChrisBHaynes Leonard absolutely deserves to be sent to Toronto. This is what happens when you quit on your team and throw a tantrum.
@ColeBacon @Shawnstone26415 @RapSheet Right now, he has the leverage of the tag. When he hits FA in 2019, the only leverage he has is what the market will bear. If no one will offer him anything more than $12MM a year, he has no leverage to go back to $15MM. So, will one team blow up the RB market for him? I say no.
@ColeBacon @Shawnstone26415 @RapSheet That's basically what he's betting on. If no one's willing to go above, say, $12MM a year, his earning potential could easily be worse than had he signed this contract. He's assuming he'll be able to get the same AAV in FA, and in my mind, that's a bad bet.
@ColeBacon @Shawnstone26415 @RapSheet Assuming he makes it 2 years, he gets $34MM. 3 years, $46MM. His earning potential is actually greater if he signs, *unless* a team is willing to absolutely blow the RB market out of the water.
@ColeBacon @Shawnstone26415 @RapSheet Assume he plays under the franchise tag this year ($14.5MM) and a team offers him a contract with an AAV of $12MM (50% more than the next highest paid RB), $24MM guaranteed. That nets him $38.5MM over three years. How does that compare with the offer he turned down?
@ColeBacon @Shawnstone26415 @RapSheet The real risk is his assumption another team will pay the same AAV as PIT. Assume he makes it to FA. What team's going to pay him $15MM a year when that's twice what the next closest RB makes? That's not how markets work. Here's a hypothetical.
@LetsEATimHUNGRY @docKev_ @some_hispanic @RapSheet They can't possibly do that. Assume the worst-case scenario. Even if he blows out a knee in yr 1, he'll have received $22MM for 2018-2019 - $10MM in signing bonus + $12MM in base salary. For reference, Sammy Watkins is guaranteed $30MM.
