@ebruenig "Like" is doing a lot of work there...it's a little more complicated, I'd say.
@ebruenig Well, good luck with that! Anyway, read Maurice Isserman's Harrington bio for more insight into the complexity of what he believed and accomplished -- and what he didn't.
@ebruenig Good! Then you should know more about what Harrington did and stood for!
@ebruenig That's fine. I'm just saying, the history is more complicated than you described. And Michael Harrington was more of a left leader than Ralph Nader, by far.
