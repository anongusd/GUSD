R. Kelly ALSO OWES $161,663 in back child support. He’s due back in court March 6th in that case. He does NOT need to pay the child support in order to bond out. His attorney says despite his fame, Kelly does not have the $100K needed for bail &amp; is actively seeking the money. https://t.co/Fk50NKtgnj
Judge granted Kelly’s request for a reduced bond after his attorney Steve Greenberg says The singer is not a flight risk, and has lived in Chicagoland his whole life. He has no tours planned.
Condition of bond for R. Kelly: 	-No contact with anyone under 18	-Must surrender passport	-No contact with the victims or witnesses in this case
Judge sets a million dollars bond for R. Kelly. He must come up with $100,000 cash to bail out of jail. Judge set bond at $250,000 in each of the 4 cases.

The Smollett case is now in its 4th week, running up a big tab with @Chicago_Police due to the amount of detectives, evidence techs, and other resources used to track down this case. No numbers have been solidified. @WGNNews
Police say Smollett is still not classified a suspect in this case, but they would like to run some information by him and his team. @WGNNews
Today, prosecutors and police are expected to meet again to discuss turning the case over to a grand jury in the Smollett case. @WGNNews
However, police sources tell me, there is video of Jussie Smollett walking around with a noose around his neck— but no video of the actual attack or in the presence of two other men. @WGNNews
I’m told Smollett’s camp has been communicating directly with Cook County Prosecutors, bypassing @Chicago_Police. Smollett’s team has promised a meeting at some point, but it all could be delayed as the actor may be hiring a new attorney. @WGNNews
Police sources also say @Chicago_Police Supt. Eddie Johnson is extremely upset over the Smollett case and the implications its had in this city. He’s especially upset about the noose reference given it’s history with African Americans. @WGNNews
Jussie Smollett update: Police sources  tell me there is no video to support the alleged attack on the #Empire actor— nor is there any video that shows Smollett with the two men. @WGNNews

TX Gov says this is the largest mass shooting in state's history. Shooter was dressed in all black w/ tactical gear, vest &amp; used .223 rifle.
TX Gov just confirmed, 26 are dead in church shooting in Sutherland Springs. 20 others injured. Ages range from 5-72.
