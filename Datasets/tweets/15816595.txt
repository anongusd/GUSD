@DRogers2019 The policies weren’t remotely similar. Trump’s policy separated far more families, and did do specifically to cause pain and lasting harm. Child abuse was the goal. But I’m fairly sure you knew that.

@blueingreenemo @IncookieCook @joemcken I work for the Opinion section of the Post. So expressing opinions is actually part of what I'm paid to do.
@blueingreenemo @IncookieCook @joemcken "They are there because of abuse." This is wrong, according to every study of sex work I've seen. It may or may not be true that most women who do sex work would rather have a different profession. But it's definitely not true that most are in sex work involuntarily.
@IncookieCook @joemcken @blueingreenemo And if I were covering the story as a journalist, I'd ask that question, among others. My two tweets were a reaction to a news story. Not every tweet by a journalist is an act of journalism.
@IncookieCook @joemcken @blueingreenemo Looking at your timeline, you've also been putting in your two cents on this story. Is it only journalists who aren't permitted to have opinions?
Here's a tidy summary of my reporting on the illegal no-knock raids in Little Rock. https://t.co/zmRmxFvymN
@kinafink It has happened before. See: https://t.co/Bznqvmrfyk
@PeteDominick Agreed. See follow-up tweet. If these women were held against their will, then it's absolutely  a proper investigation. But I've seen lots of these investigations claim trafficking in initial headlines, then ultimately result in little more than solicitation charges.
I see there are allegations these women were held involuntarily, If true, then of course this was not a wasteful investigation. But we've seen many busts initially touted as "trafficking" result only in prostitution and solicitation charges. So we'll see. https://t.co/jrDHa5dQxS
As much as I'd like to revel in this (like all red-blooded Americans, I too hate the Patriots), a "months-long" investigation into illegal handjobs is one of the dumbest uses of law enforcement resources imaginable.
Steyn says no one alive had a grandparent who was a slave. As if Jim Crow, lynching, Bull Connor, assassinations of civil rights leaders, etc. never happened. Then he and Tucker have a good laugh. 		Decent people should stop going on this show. 		https://t.co/VVBkibDqQw
@ctestcraig @Popehat Highly doubtful.
@iansiBalls I think there is confusion, and it's intended. (Mourges too conflates the two in her brief.) One is sound science, the other isn't. A good defense attorney should note the distinction, but it's hard to get jurors to care.
Finally, I'd add that 25 people have been wrongly arrested or convicted b/c of bitemark analysis-- most recently in December, when a Texas appeals court was sharply critical of bite matching in exonerating Steven Chaney. He had served 28 years.  /end 		https://t.co/wirCdZqCfO
The following year, 2017, a Penn. prosecutor used large portions of Mourges' memo -- some verbatim -- in a homicide case. The judge in that case ruled for the state, allowing bitemark evidence. /10		https://t.co/I2UuWNMG0q
Incidentally, Mourges won that hearing. The judge allowed the BM evidence. But her office later withdrew the evidence in a huffy (also misleading) memo. This came after yet more embarrassing debacles for the bitemark matching field. /9  https://t.co/9ue0DJRewp
It's also a bit much for Mourges to bring the outrage after a bit of public criticism. She has nastily and unfairly maligned critics of bitemark matching over the years, including whistleblower Michael Bowers and researchers Mary and Peter Bush. /8 		https://t.co/W0QMJFbB3Y
By the way, that isn't the only misrepresentation in her brief. I noted several others in my 2015 series on bitemark analysis. /7 https://t.co/W0QMJFbB3Y
Mourges claimed it was unfair to criticize her for this quote because she also submitted the entire NAS report into evidence. I'd argue that submitting the entire text you blatantly misrepresented in your brief doesn't excuse the fact that you misrepresented it in your brief. /6
Here's my slide. The black text is the portion of the NAS report that Mourges quoted in her court filing. The red text is the portion she left out. 		Her quote says BM analysis is accepted by BM analysts. (Shocking!) She omits that it is rejected by just about everyone else!  /5 https://t.co/s45EUNhEEm
Mourges filed a long brief in response. She tried to dismiss the defense invocation of the NAS report in part by quoting from the report herself. I found her quote rather . . . selective. Remember, the issue here is whether bitemark evidence is scientifically valid. /4
Here's the context: This was a murder case. The state wanted to introduce bitemark evidence. The defense challenged the validity of bitemark analysis, noting, among other things, that BM evidence had been discredited in the 2009 National Academy of Sciences (NAS) report.  /3
The prosecutor, Manhattan ADA Melissa Mourges, later told others that I had "slandered" her. It's a pretty brazen display of entitlement, not uncommon among prosecutors. So I'm going to share the PowerPoint slide in question, provide some context, and let you decide.  /2
Thread: On Wednesday, a prosecutor publicly chewed me out, reprimanding me for a solid few minutes before ending her rant with "Cut the shit!" I had just given a talk at #AAFS2019, in which I said I thought the prosecutor had been recklessly misleading in a 2013 court filing.  /1

@Kinniska See my timeline. I wrote that piece.
I've reached out to Mr. Carpenter request clarification. One other thing: His comment in the video about the search warrants being approved by judges is true. The fact that Little Rock judges were approving illegal no-knock warrants is part of the problem. /3
Here's the video in question. It isn't clear to me how the objectionable parts -- the use of explosives to blow the door off its hinges, the screaming, heavily armed cops -- could have been "edited" to make the video misrepresent what actually happened. /2 https://t.co/PYBBV5G32j
Clip from a Little Rock city council meeting this week. A council member expressed concern over the violent tactics LRPD used in its drug raid on Roderick Talley. Little Rock city attorney Tom Carpenter scolded her, then claimed that the video of the raid had been "edited." /1 https://t.co/tF57tzGMYG
I've since learned that the cop who clearly lied in a search warrant affidavit in Roderick Talley's case is still conducting drug investigations for LRPD, and still obtaining no-knock warrants. /4
As I was in the middle of *that* investigation, I discovered that LRPD drug cops blatantly lied in at least one drug case, have been using explosives to blow down doors, and routinely conduct no-knock raids that are clearly illegal. /3 https://t.co/Hw6NxTk61C

As the episode closes, Niles realizes that due to the mixup, he has still yet to do anything rebellious. 		Frasier points out, “You did get our cop father stoned.”		Cue “Tossed Salad and Scrambled Eggs”		#FrasierSOTU
Frasier gets stood up by the woman from the tourism board. Frederick gets dumped by his Goth girlfriend. The two bond — as Crane men often do — over their lack of luck with women.		#FrasierSOTU
The reveal:		#FrasierSOTU https://t.co/kbI6STAiF9
Martin decides he needs to sit down. He turns on the TV, where Frasier has just been watching the tourism video. He sees this:		#FrasierSOTU https://t.co/WE1yxQifWG
Martin now has the munchies. He dips a potato chip in chocolate pudding and says . . . 		#FrasierSOTU https://t.co/3OjsKAw2KX
A clearly high, hysterically laughing Martin shows up. He tells Niles that he’s tired of all the “turning” people have to do, and wishes “we could all just go straight. “ Like giants. “They should let everyone be a giant for a day.”		#FrasierSOTU
Prior to Niles showing up, Frasier had been sent a copy of the tourism video — the one that he thought would depict him walking through Seattle, with perhaps a few shots of Eddie the dog. Instead, the video stars Eddie as a talking dog — with Frasier’s voice. 		#FrasierSOTU
Niles shows up at Frasier’s apartment, mistakenly thinking he’s high. He throws out some out-of-place stoner lingo, then delivers the best line of the show.		#FrasierSOTU https://t.co/jTAgTtCv7a
Martin buys another not-pot brownie from the coffee shop, and gives it to Niles instead. Of course, Niles still thinks his brownie is pot. And Martin doesn’t know he’s about to get high.		Meanwhile, 2 cops show up at the coffee shop. Niles nearly hyperventilates.		#FrasierSOTU
Roz tries to get Frazier to hold the pot brownie for Niles. He refuses, “I’m not a common drug mule!” 		Martin shows up. Roz gives him the brownie to give to Niles, but doesn’t tell him it’s pot. Starving from his diet, Martin gives in and eats the brownie.		#FrasierSOTU https://t.co/eNSRc2muVG
Roz comes by and hooks him up with a brownie. Niles thinks it’s pure pot, “thick and gooey. Ganja in its purest form.”		Niles’ car alarm goes off. He leaves to shut off, but forgets  the brownie, setting the stage for the switch that drives the rest of the episode.		#FrasierSOTU
Niles comes up with a plan to experience the teenage rebellious phase he never had. 		#FrasierSOTU https://t.co/kPaXeJQxUS
Frederic’s friend “Andy” shows up. The two of them go to a movie. 		Niles: “At least he isn’t dating outside the faith.”		#FrasierSOTU https://t.co/cVf2yHoqCb
Martin: 		“One time I found a bag of something that looked suspicious in your dresser, but it just turned out to be something to make your sweaters smell nice.”		#FrasierSOTU
Frederick’s Goth phase gets the gang talking about youthful rebellion, at which point Niles realizes he never had a rebellious stage. #FrasierSOTU https://t.co/yVafv2SUvl
Frasier:		“The Goths were plunderers. Apart from your tendency to be overly aggressive with your rooks at chess camp, I don’t see the connection.”		(Hint: It’s because of a girl.)		#FrasierSOTU
Meanwhile, Frederick (Frasier’s son) is visiting from Boston for the holiday. He’s going through a phase. #FrasierSOTU https://t.co/kRpzfmPo6g
She then suggests that Eddie been in the promotional video, too. Frasier reluctantly agrees. #FrasierSOTU
Back to the show! Frasier meets with an attractive woman from the Seattle tourism board to discuss his starring in a promotional video for the city. He’s smitten with her accent. She’s smitten with Eddie. #FrasierSOTU https://t.co/28xdpRCG90
Seems like a good time to note again that John Mahoney, who played Martin Crane, died last year. He’ll be remembered most for this role, but he was first a renowned stage actor. (And British!) He also didn’t begin acting until his 40s. RIP. #FrasierSOTU 		https://t.co/ejYXzXv8Vq

Politicians and their advisors vastly underestimate how powerful it can be show a little humility and say “I was wrong.” 		Of course, the problem with Harris may well be that she genuinely thinks she did nothing wrong as Calif. AG. And that’s impossible to square with CJ reform.
If Kamala Harris expressed regret about her record and said she’d learned from mistakes, that might be plausible. If she ran on her record as a law &amp; order Democrat, that’d at least be honest. But to to defend her record *and* claim the reform mantle is some high-proof cynicism.

@kilovh It has definitely happened. But one problem is that these experts don't regularly subject themselves to competency tests. So we really don't know how good they actually are in the areas where they're claiming expertise.
RT @briantashman: https://t.co/iY0SuutFWq
! 		https://t.co/6uzZJphPhW
@kilovh It's entirely subjective. An analyst looks at two samples and decides if they're a "match." The characteristics analysts use to determine a "match" can't be tested, and there isn't a calculable margin for error.
And even in fields unquestionably within the boundaries of science, like forensic pathology, there are bad actors who give testimony unsupported by science. And the current system not only fails at correcting these problems, it often selects for and rewards the bad actors. /3
Some aren't scientific, but of great use (fingerprinting). Single source DNA is scientific and immensely useful. Multiple source DNA is dicier. But in all of these fields (save for single source DNA), analysts routinely overstate significance and certainty of their findings. /2
I get this question a lot. So here's my opinion: Some fields are useless (bite marks). Some are too subjective to know if they're useful (tool marks). Some are not scientific, but of some use (blood spatter, hair fiber, shoe print, tire tread).   /1 https://t.co/V9qM4NaQcH

@Sporkicide Right. Like many areas of forensics, it isn't entirely useless. (Even a clear bite mark could be used to exclude a suspect with no teeth.) The problem is that it's applied in ways well beyond what can be scientifically deduced.
Good. The Mass. ban on "secret recording" of police was the last obstacle to nationwide protection for recording public, on-duty cops w/o limitation. The ruling also seems to deem this "well-established law," so QI won't protect ongoing unlawful arrests. https://t.co/UgxSiTarNh
@willhugalldogs Yes. But they eliminated that one, too.

4/ He shouldn't have fled. But it isn't difficult to see how the guy might begin to think that law enforcement was out to get him. I can't say for sure that I wouldn't have panicked, too.
3/ The charge was resurrected, coincidentally, right at about the time that Talley began exposing corrupt LRPD narcotics cops on social media. 		So yeah, everything about this stinks . . .
2/ It was a 22-month old charge for felony "forgery." *That* was because Talley made an honest mistake while trying to reclaim property that had been taken from him during a traffic stop under asset forfeiture laws. The underlying charge that allowed the forfeiture was dropped.
1/ He did flee an arrest, which was a mistake. He was arrested for being late to court on a wintry day when the sheriff himself warned residents to stay off the roads. The charge he was due in court for? That's problematic too . . .
I know there's a lot going on right now, but the guy who came to me to blow the whistle about the illegal Little Rock drug raids is in a jail cell right now. And everything about his arrest stinks. https://t.co/wkoJWsybu6

@AyeRishPirate @PeterMoskos @SteveBellow If it's anything like NYC, the data will show that less than 1 percent of these stops produce evidence of criminal activity. Which means the rest is just hassling black people.
@PeterMoskos @AyeRishPirate @SteveBellow As I understand it, the argument isn't that the form itself caused the reduction in stops that led to the increase in violence, but de-policing in protest of the form. Am I wrong? In any case, given the history of these stops, extra paperwork seems worth the added transparency.
@KevDavis @CureViolence Can see how murders near your home would be affecting. Don't know if you saw it, but check my post on @CureViolence. I find the evidence pretty compelling that what they're doing is working. https://t.co/mCJTZbR53W
@AyeRishPirate @SteveBellow If that's true, then the ACLU agreement shouldn't be a problem. It only requires them to document stops. It puts no restrictions on stops themselves. If all the stops are legit, there should be no concern about documenting them.
@KevDavis Shootings are down too. But my point isn't that all is okay in Chicago. Just that less aggressive policing doesn't appear to be making it worse. Far more persuaded by the argument that the violence is related to cutting funding for intervention groups like @CureViolence.

@CharlesFLehman Again, it isn’t a figure that’s going to be easy to collect. But it does jibe with usage figures, which makes sense. The surveys we do have show similar results. And there’s no data I know of that suggests blacks sell at a rate anywhere near their rate of incarceration.
@CharlesFLehman I’d imagine that the 12-25 age range comprises a pretty healthy percentage of drug dealers. And to the extent that the racial demographics might change after 25, it seems intuitive that they’re more likely to be white, since black dealers are more likely to be caught &amp; convicted.
An interesting (and damning) thing I learned researching this post: My wife @LilianaSegura suggested I look at studies of light and dark-skinned blacks. Sure enough. The more “African” a black person’s color/ features, the worse the system treats them. https://t.co/L91nMf4dKp
@Moke453 That’s encouraging to hear. I do think libertarians generally and some conservatives have gotten much better on this.
@EnochPowell68 @ErikWemple As I pointed out in the post, most (but not all) of these studies are adjusted for the disproportionate black/white crime rates. So the bias exists even when you factor that in. There’s also a good argument that systemic bias is in part why the black crime rate is higher.
@CharlesFLehman Less compelling, but interesting: Many studies show that while black motorists more likely to be searched, white motorists more likely to have drugs. Hunch is that cops who search motorists usually looking for forfeiture, so these are more likely to be dealers. Just a hunch, tho.
@CharlesFLehman It isn’t easy data to come by, b/c it necessarily relies on self-reporting. But the surveys that have been done suggest black/white sell drugs at about the same rate, or whites slightly higher. See: 		https://t.co/TdgRLRRJwy		https://t.co/Y3Iu4NMHQ6		https://t.co/yuS46VfCPT

I’m sure there are many I’ve missed. If you know of some, please send them my way. I’d like the post to be an ongoing project. (As you’ll see, in the interest of a full airing of the data, there’s also a section for studies that *don’t* find racial bias). /7
After seeing a number of conservative and libertarian writers and pundits make some of the same mistaken assumptions I had made in recent months, I started keeping a list of studies demonstrating racial bias. This post is an effort to compile them all in one place. /6
I’ve seen it anecdotally in the places I’ve gone to report stories — Church Point, LA; Putnam County, IN; St. Louis County, MO; all over Mississippi, etc. But there’s also overwhelming empirical evidence. It’s just too one-sided to ignore. /5
That’s because it didn’t take long on this beat to realize that I was wrong. Embarrassingly so. You can’t cover this beat and not be overwhelmed by the difference between the way white and black people are treated by the criminal justice system. /4
I grew up in an all-white county. My politics are generally libertarian, a political philosophy that’s overwhelmingly white. Those are the explanations for my skepticism about racial bias in the criminal justice system. But in retrospect, that line still makes me cringe.  /3
About 12 years ago, I wrote my first piece of investigative journalism. It was for Reason, about the case of Cory Maye. I’m proud of my work in that case, but one line in my story has increasingly irked me in the years since. It’s this one:  /2 https://t.co/wfSqtyLhVs

@prisrob Excusable isn’t the same thing as capable of rehabilitation and redemption.
@jimlewis99 Fai point. But again, the stakes are quite a bit different. Denying someone their freedom despite uncertainty of guilt isn’t quite the same as denying someone a Supreme Court seat for the same reason.
@dfranke But he didn’t say he had no recollection. He categorically denied it.
And while I don’t think people should be made to pay their entire lives for mistakes they made as juveniles, many *are.” And for crimes very much like this one. So let’s have that conversation. But a white guy tying to get on the Supreme Court probably isn’t the place to start.
False accusations happen. And people shouldn’t pay the rest of their lives for mistakes they made as minors. But you don’t get redemption when you’re still denying the accusation. “This accusation is slander! And he was only 17 when he did it!” isn’t a convincing argument. 1/2
@CBHessick Not to mention the fact that he’s categorically denying it. I’d be more open to the redemption/he was only 17 argument if it came after a display of humility and acknowledgment of culpability.

I’m open to the argument that there wasn’t much more the federal government could have done in Puerto Rico, at least at the time. But with 3,000 dead, maybe some damned humility and solemnity are in order. Maybe don’t dislocate your shoulder trying to pat yourself on the back.

Next is the use of the phrase “free minds, markets,” which is the motto of Reason, which suggests someone from libertarian circles. The op-ed also mentions deregulation as one of Trump’s successes (if in spite of himself). /2

@NathanBurney Also, systemic racism doesn’t necessarily mean racially disparate outcomes in the absence of racism by individual actors — just that the latter isn’t necessarily a requirement. When both *are* present, they tend to reinforce one another.
@NathanBurney Agree that we shouldn’t be calling well-intentioned but misinformed people “racist.” But we shouldn’t avoid the term b/c of discomfort. These systems were designed and evolved during Jim Crow for a very specific purpose. They still serve that purpose, even w/ good intentions.
@Conserv_a_Tude Not a liberal, but thanks. Also, recent history has demonstrated that once in power, conservatives aren’t interest in “subjugating” government so much as putting it to use to advance their own interests.
Conservatives often misunderstand what systemic racism means. It does *not* mean everyone in the system is racist. Almost the opposite. It means the system doesn't dispense justice equally, regardless of the motives/intentions of cops/judges/prosecutors. https://t.co/vOhb0fWU9K

@BlueCapitalist Read the article. Midazolam by itself isn't what causes the pain, one of the other drugs does. The state argues that it's supposed to prevent the pain. But there's no evidence that it does. It's is also mixed with hydrochloric acid, then injected into the lungs.
Also, you might think that states would show an abundance of care, caution, and reverence when it comes to carrying out a power as solemn and profound as taking a human life. Not so much. https://t.co/yCgGJlfdMj https://t.co/nm0j2d4oVu

@Classical_Dee @bigbearjet That's a valid opinion. I just ask that we make policy based on facts, not hyperbole.
5. Finally, research shows that low recidivism isn't due to registries, restrictions, post-sentence detention, etc. Most shows registries don't work, and public notification is particularly harmful. See:		https://t.co/FVSUqWlDjT	https://t.co/63fUYGj1NB	https://t.co/sfIiOhKeRd
4. Public opinion is wildly at odds with the research. Research puts recidivism rate at 5-15 percent. 70 percent of public thinks half or more will reoffend.	  	https://t.co/yz0PBykMgN
3. Misinformation about recidivism is why we have these policies. Anthony Kennedy was duped by a 1986 article in a pop psychology magazine. One false line from his McKune opinion has been recited ad nauseum by courts and legislatures across the country. https://t.co/1wqnFGIJZq
2. Research has also consistently shown that sex offenders are *more* likely to reoffend in more punitive cities/states, esp. restricting where they can live and work. So treating them differently actually is worse for them and worse for society. See: https://t.co/hkjVDll4kR
My response to this thread: 		1. The newsworthy thing about this study (and why I tweeted it) is that it was suppressed. Otherwise, it's just further confirmation of the existing research, which has consistently, convincingly shown the same thing. 		/1 		https://t.co/M45zbDV3yb

@JerylBier Yeah, I have little doubt that bureaucratic haze, under-staffing, incompetence, etc. resulted in some kids placed with poorly vetted, potentially dangerous people. But it's a hell of a stretch to say traffickers could anticipate, exploit those problems in a systematic way.
What really caused the 2016 spike in Chicago homicides? In our interview, Gary Slutkin of Cure Violence makes a persuasive case that it was a cut in funding for anti-violence groups like his. https://t.co/9lAWavjopf
@ScottGreenfield Hmm. A GOP investigation found 30 examples from thousands of cases, most of which weren't confirmed trafficking but merely had "trafficking indicators." Not convinced that this justifies all the alarmism.
I keep seeing the clam that catch-and-release is regularly exploited by human traffickers. Is there any good evidence for this? It may well be true, but deploying dubious trafficking claims to justify bad policy is common enough that my first reaction is skepticism.

"Assaulting an officer" is a common charge police use to intimidate people they've abused so the victim won't file a complaint. This bill would allow them to intimidate with the added threat of a 10-year prison term.

@lrrykeho But he wasn't pinned. And he kept firing when that was clear. There's a reason why NYPD, IACP, and PEER all prohibit firing into moving cars. It isn't Monday Morning Quarterbacking. It's sound policy that stops innocent people from getting killed.
@ox45al George Will. Michael Gerson. Marc Thiessen. Charles Krauthammer. Hugh Hewitt. Charles Lane. Joe Scarborough. Max Boot. That's eight. That's just the Washington Post. You could also add right-leaning Jennifer Rubin and Megan McArdle.
Mr. local news expert is wrong. Cop was clearly not pinned. Firing into a fleeing vehicle puts all nearby at risk. Also puts potential innocents (like children) in the car at risk. And if you do kill the driver, you now have a driverless vehicle careening through a parking lot.
