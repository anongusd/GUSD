Let's consider this some more. The outgoing speaker of the House, @SpeakerRyan, never mentions the name "Donald Trump" in his farewell address. A president from his own party. Ryan. Never. Mentioned. Trump. Do you think a Democratic speaker would've done this to Barack Obama?
/3 Ryan came in as a policy wonk - I knew him when he was a Senate staffer, so that's more than 22 years - and he goes out a policy wonk.
/2 Also, Ryan never says the word "Trump" during his farewell address. He says "president," but not Trump. At least per the written version of his speech
This portion of Ryan's farewell speech gets to his own biggest contradiction/limitation/failure as speaker. He's railing about partisanship when Trump - who he thanked for being his "partner" in an earlier passage - is the worst offender in our lifetime.
