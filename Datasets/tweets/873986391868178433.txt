Year. This means out of 100 calls you will be allowed 5 replacements, either from parts being NLA, or AHS decided to replace without telling you. I am calling on the appliance service brotherhood to boycott AHS, till they treat us better. Without us, they are nothing.
To the 3rd thing  replacements, all replacements count against the service company's so if service company can not repair OR customer bitches loud enough and gets a new appliance, THIS counts against you monthly average. In 2019 ALL company's MUST BE under 5% replacements for
Them $100.00 for total cost of repairs. They will supply parts, but this cost ALSO affects your average.  So if you get your 100 and the part cost is 140.00 your average is 240.00. You do not know what the part cost is, because the parts department Does not even know this, so on
American home shield has just announced that beginning 2019, if service company do not have a 4.5 star rating out of 5, you will no longer be receiving work. There are 3 factors that they will be looking at closely,  COST, AHS is looking for service company that will only charge

Not 1 but 4 times, and ON CAMERA by a local news agency. 	I am a lift time member of the Republican party, I donated over $ 35,000.00 to Trump and the Republican party, and this is the thanks I got. To support a crook over me. I have reached out to Trump and the NRC, no  1/3
As I went to sign up to run for the  county mayor of Ruterford county mayor, I went to my local Republican office to let her know I was running, she then told me she was supporting a local State Senator that has been caught stealing money out of his campaign donation fund  1 of 2
