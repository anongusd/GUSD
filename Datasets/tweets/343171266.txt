Free markets have lifted more people out of poverty than any other economic system in the history of the world. I am a product of that system and of the American Dream that my parents worked so hard to achieve.  		https://t.co/Ompc7MvOz2

To see members stay seated on proposed legislation to stop late term abortion, was heart breaking. Have we stopped cherishing life?

Looking forward to joining Anderson Cooper on @AC360 tonight on @CNN. 6pm MT/8pm ET.
Late term abortion is not a left/right issue. It’s a moral issue. We should value life at all stages. 		 3rd trimester abortion is unconscionable and it is time for Americans of all political ideologies to reject this immoral agenda.		https://t.co/SPGqSn0KV3
A new year brings new opportunities for elevated conversations about the issues that matter.  My time in Congress has ended but the chance to engage Americans is only beginning - I’m excited to join CNN to offer a different, principled and unleashed perspective.

Thank you to the @SBAList for their endorsement!

Fact Check: Actions speak louder than words. On multiple occasions, McAdams	advocated or allowed for increased taxes. In 2015, McAdams advocated for $10 million in continued higher taxes. And in 2016, McAdams supported increasing property taxes by 9.5%. #utdebates

Fact: I have consistently opposed the imposition of tariffs. I asked the Trump Administration not to impose them many times, and have cosponsored numerous bills to rescind them. #utdebates
My question to Ben McAdams:		Since you don't live in the district and can't vote for yourself in this race, who are you going to vote for for Congress? #utdebate #utpol
Fact check: When McAdams was a member of Utah's Senate, he was rated the “most liberal state senator in Utah” by the Salt Lake Tribune. #utdebate https://t.co/ERcW1fSA4C
Fact check: I've received the Climate Leadership Award from Citizen’s Climate Lobby and I've been endorsed by Clearpath and endorsed by Citizens for Responsible Energy Solutions. #utdebates
I'm proud to have helped pass more than 60 bills to combat the opioid crisis, extend the CHIP program for 9 years, and improve health care for veterans. #utdebates
Fact: When my Democratic colleague Marcia Fudge called me “a leader from the beginning” on immigration, Ben attacked her: https://t.co/8f05aubfWk #utdebates

There are three questions I ask myself when considering legislation: 		1. Is it affordable?	2. Is it sustainable?	3. Is it my job?		#utdebates
Fact check: Ben McAdams pushed for a 9,000 housing unit project known as Olympia Hills after taking over $10,000 from the developers even though local residents strongly opposed the project. #utdebate
Fact: Revenues are up since tax reform. The United States government has a spending problem, not a revenue problem: https://t.co/qXGyGuhZWZ #utdebates
Fact: Ben McAdams has consistently raised taxes in Salt Lake County, but falsely claimed that he has lowered them: https://t.co/jLkGOU2BCy #utdebates
I have been and always will be committed to preserving Social Security and have voted for a balanced budget amendment, which passed the House this Congress. #utpol #utdebates

Utahns are rightfully concerned about potentially irresponsible growth in their communities.

Martin O’Malley joins Ben McAdams on the campaign trail today. O’ Malley supports abortion up until the moment a fetus can survive outside the womb and raised taxes multiple times. Do liberal minds think alike? You just can’t trust Ben. #utpol 		https://t.co/oH4fdSpZw9

Ben attended this DC fundraiser in the middle of the work week while taking his full-time Mayoral salary of $195k. 		Also, just six months ago he took over $10k in donations from the Olympia Hills developers looking to build 9,000 housing units in South SL County. #WordsorActions https://t.co/fmslvYyLBu
Monday: McAdams unveiled a commercial stating “What’s going on in Washington makes you feel dirty, with all the special interest money... we need to clean it up”. 		Last Night: He was the guest of honor at a fundraiser in DC taking money from those exact special interest groups. https://t.co/d8WrDqMrTw

1/2: Last night Ben McAdams sent out a fundraising email from one of his only endorsers, Rep. Joe Kennedy (D-MA). 		Why is he touting this endorsement? This is the same Joe Kennedy who: 	-- has a 100% rating by Planned Parenthood	-- votes with Nancy Pelosi 97% of the time https://t.co/Vb72xIiilQ

2/2: If this tax isn’t repealed, Utah’s companies won’t have the money to invest in employees and assets in this rapidly changing industry. Last year, the medical device industry generated $5 billion to this state’s economy &amp; generated 10,600 jobs. There is a lot at stake here. https://t.co/D96zduPRJ1

3/3: Ben has opposed even common-sense restrictions on abortion such as a 72-hour waiting period. He opposed a bill that protected pro-life doctors from being forced to perform abortions. He even voted against a bipartisan bill that ensured that only doctors perform abortions.
“The Tribune, in its own review, found that there were at least seven bills related to restricting access to abortion that McAdams voted against as a state senator." #utpol  https://t.co/WDz63F3Kpx
1/3: Can voters really trust Ben on this issue? While he tries to fool voters on the campaign trail, his voting record says the exact opposite. 		You’ve never had to wonder where I stand. My words and my voting record match up. #utpol https://t.co/WDz63F3Kpx

2/2: If we want our children to stop the violent behavior towards each other, maybe adults should start being kind examples to one another. #utpol
1/2: Really? Kicking a mother and her children out of a restaurant for her views or who she works for? Adults tell children to stop the bullying in school, then turn around and behave as perfect examples of bullies.
ICYMI: The bill we passed this week is: 		✅ bi-partisan	✅ increases access to treatment	✅ boosts prevention efforts 	✅ protects Utahns. 		I’m doing everything I can to make sure we get this epidemic out in the light and under control. #utpol 		https://t.co/1iwBGb4IeD

1/3: Immigration reform is deeply personal to me. 		Why? Because I grew up with parents who faced the hardships of living under a dictatorship.		They came to America hoping that the peace and opportunity they heard about really did exist. They worked hard jobs scrubbing toilets. https://t.co/GmYiC4I6Ka

Ben, you don't live in the 4th district but I do. Our communities deserve better than "McAdams Pay to Play" tactics. We need local solutions, not donor solutions.  #utpol https://t.co/dmgaQ28Fax
2/2: The proof is in the donations, over $10,000 to his congressional race from the Olympia developers right about the time Ben negotiated the deal. Utahn's won't be fooled w/ "pay McAdams to play" tactics. I will continue to fight for my community until Ben vetoes the proposal. https://t.co/MJKPRDwmpw
1/2 : Frustrated mayors in SL County have been reaching out to me as McAdams is now trying to look like a power broker following outrage w/the Olympia project. Just last week he was pushing high-density housing as his own solution &amp; refused to listen to the mayors and residents.

My opponent has made false claims about public safety in Saratoga Springs. Here are the facts: #utpol #ut4 http://t.co/gDuySQ42
My opponent's false attacks against me are easily debunked by simple charts like this: http://t.co/DUNs6AW5 #utpol #ut4
The qualified candidate has the experience of leading on different issues, managing budgets, and is one that lives in the district. #utpol
I have been attacked for leading out. So have many other great leaders. I am not afraid to step up and speak out for Utah.
