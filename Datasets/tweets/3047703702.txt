@thehill How incredibly tone-deaf and unaware.

@FORSCOMLdrDev Many have likely already taken the GRE if they have a masters degree.  As SSC is degree producing the GRE should be entrance requirement.  Will govt fund test cost if it is required, or individuals pay?

@Doctrine_Man Looking forward to a similar reconciliation when I try to do a final clearance of CIF.
@Doctrine_Man Actions have consequences, without them what deterrent is there for others?

@AirPowerUnicorn Life is a series of choices, choose wisely or suffer the consequences of your decisions.
Yeah but I’ll have to go out and shovel all that white bullshit, so there’s that. https://t.co/u67eNVsFDe
So much going on socially, politically lately that beg engagement and commentary.		But it’s usually ‘oh fuck it, who cares’, is there a hockey game on?
Reasons my shoulder hurts:	1.  It’s going to snow tomorrow 	2.  I’m getting old	3.  My physical therapist was not buying my BS today.		Any or all are possible.
Regardless of your political or sexual orientations, if you fake a homophobic, racial, political attack against yourself then you are an insufferable douche.

@ewarren Please go away.
@socialism_liker @SenSanders Not all do, but ok.
@socialism_liker @SenSanders Sales taxes are levied by the states, not the federal govt.
@SenSanders Weren’t the moneys that purchased those assets already taxed before they were bought/invested/saved?  Why do you think the govt gets two shots at taxation?
2 month hiatus from hockey, quite rusty and exhausted
@realDonaldTrump Mr. President, there are growing calls for gun control, ‘common sense’ restrictions, limits on magazines.  Don’t let this happen on your watch.
Great hockey tonight from the Bs! @NHLBruins
Say it again, slowly...then actually listen to the words.		https://t.co/kR9gz3OUN5

@BetoORourke I would argue against your premise that the border is secure and walls end lives.
RT @officialmcafee: Got huge disapproval for adding 18 year old Scotch to a mixed drink last night. Well . . . . I'm an adult. In my world,…
@Doctrine_Man Some great points, and while it’s not one or the other there will come a time to choose which spouse’s career gets prioritized.
@Slate I’m in the same boat, but he’s only 11 years old so I have a few years left before I can make an issue out of it.
@elonmusk Amazing work!
Little league tryouts underway this weekend, is it a common thing to provide a check for $150 that won’t be cashed if I perform 6 hours of ‘volunteer’ work during the season?
Something I never thought would happen...my 11y/o explaining gifs and memes to my mother at the kitchen table before school.
How long until Friday?
@Ocasio2018 Or you’re the newbie and got the equivalent of “find me a box of grid squares and chem light batteries.”
Great work guys!  Keep it going! https://t.co/cDTGnAgMd3
In NC for a wedding, nothing like some bad O2 sensors to throw a wrench into the days plans.

@tmasson Taking millions of legally owned firearms from millions of law abiding citizens will require a LOT more government.
RT @laurahelmuth: Beautiful graphic of all the snow -- every inch! -- that fell on the Lower 48 this year. Goodbye, winter, and good riddan…
Beware the law of unintended consequences when asking,  marching, demanding more government.
Want to raise the age to 21? Ok, but be ready for those that come back with repealing the 26th and raising the age to 21.  Really want to poke them in the eye-raise the driving age to 18 #leadingcauseofteendeath
@tmasson Beckett's.  I wasn't quick enough with the tooth fairy $$
Two lost teeth in the last week, this morning I was politely reminded that the Tooth Fairy is on 'her' ass.
Wanna see a 9 yo jump 2 ft in the air and scream like someone was killing him? Let a tick crawl across his pants.  #hismomsson
I just agreed to let him have a friend sleep over, what have I done?
Disheartening life event I didn't need - barber asking if I wanted an eyebrow trim.  Yeah, no thanks bud.
Ocean Drive, South Beach on the motorcycle...'You need to wave at all the pretty girls' 'OMG Dad, you are sooooo embarrassing.'  #DadGoals
Yes I occasionally have dad jokes...'Beckett, yes I am hilarious,'. 'No Dad, you are annoying.'
Morning on the beach, in the water collecting rocks etc., Dad, this is just like snorkeling only fun.
Phrase of the week-Dad, can you...?  in relation to some menial task his highness would rather that I perform in his service
Another 20k step day FINALLY wore him down and he tapped...3 straight days and he is finally tired.
Vacation with a 9 y/o....ok, I'm done, you can shower now.   Thanks bud.
Coming back from the beach with 20 lbs of rocks -for examination- is normal, right?
My son has a servant on this vacation, that person is apparently me.
RT @AMMass6: Only my son would hop on the boat of ArmySF and ask for a pic. @srmasson @USArmy https://t.co/YAAtW01Brr
We will go to the beach in 30 minutes, just let me take a quick nap....29 min, 59 sec later...Dad, lets go, I'm all packed and ready to go.
Hey, your sand castle is looking great....Beckett-stop it Mr. Sarcastic...
Hey dad, I wonder where the sign is that says 'Robbie's'.... https://t.co/TtoVe1INk1
0800, waiting to start leg 3-Miami to Key West.  Me: let's go time to get up.  Beckett:  not yet, I'm not ready.  Leg 3 officially delayed..
5 min after arrival in Miami, fixing some brown liquor...Beckett where are....SPLASH....I guess he found the pool
After 150 miles on the bike....	Beckett-dad I need a break, this seat makes my butt hurt
Continental breakfast on the train.  Beckett-is this it?  What's a croissant?
We are sitting on opposite sides of the train...Beckett-um, I'm going to need to close your blinds, the sun is shining on my iPad.
Beckett - this is just luxurious...
This is gonna be a long bumpy ride, mostly long
Dad i think youve lost your mind, its in the other car
Ok, now im all settled and comfortable. https://t.co/p9VyqwQIZw
So Beckett and I are taking the Amtrak Autotrain from VA to FL, and then motorcycle to Key West.  Will be tweeting his amusing comments.
@CombatGent @Bloomingdales can I get the items I ordered in Aug if I stop by?
@tmasson I will make plans to visit, would love to take that tour as well.
