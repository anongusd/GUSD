Congratulations! @katieporteroc		Democrat Katie Porter's win in Orange County shows the power of a populist message -- even in an affluent, historically Republican California district. #Midterms2018 https://t.co/bDpeGOAdfX via @HuffPostPol
@realDonaldTrump @WhiteHouse I follow the White House because it's a US institution. I don't follow Donald Trump because he's appalling. Please don't retweet his personal tweets on an official government page.
@SenatorCollins But hey wow - I just spent some time scrolling through your follower's responses and I couldn't find one supporting you. Everyone despises you now... So I guess this is probably your home stretch to retirement
@SenatorCollins I wonder how many addicts turned to drugs to cope and escape memories of abuse and assault - I bet quite a few .. so do you deserve credit for putting a band-aid on a problem you endorsed?
So grateful for the opportunity to meet such an inspiration. (New to posting on Twitter so I hope my tags and hash tags are correct) #elizabethwarren @SenWarren https://t.co/65t1m7NNks
@SenGillibrand Doing what's right without recognition in the face of adversity is what makes someone a hero. But alas, have faith! Despite the hate, so many of us do recognize the heroism you've displayed. Thank you from all of America - including those that don't get it.
@SenGillibrand Thank you, Senator Gillibrand for standing up for what is right and standing up to hate. Sadly, most of those writing you hateful / ungrateful messages don't even realize it is them you are thanklessly defending.

Wow. First time I signed into this account in a few month. Apparently it was hacked. I never wrote anything of those posts in May or June.
