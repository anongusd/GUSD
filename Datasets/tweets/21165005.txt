This is true, though: In the past, like, five years, I've only ever got called out for hating on La La Land, which I *did* actually see.
I love the Oscars because I get to have strong feelings about 2398702938 movies I haven't seen based on ENTIRELY arbitrary things and everyone's going to be so caught up in their feelings that no one's going to call me on it.
@kerriganspirals Pretty sure they also got nominated for a Tony back in like...2012. So.

(Also, let's be real: almost all of these nominated movies would give me  A LOT of emotions and that's something I'm NOT making time for.)
I take great joy in talking about how few movies I've seen, mostly because it shocks people in a way I find confusing. I'm not *proud* that I don't make time for movies - I just think it's funny everyone cares so much more than I do!
Omg wait I lied - I've actually seen FOUR THINGS! Amazing. That's a 200% improvement! Big year for me. 		I saw Incredibles 2, Solo: A Star Wars Story, Mary Poppins, and Bao.
I've seen THREE THINGS of the many nominated for Oscars this year! This is a 150% improvement over TWO THINGS at the Golden Globes (and yes, that included all the television shows).

There's a Men's Health article that says that by WEEK 2 of your workout plan, you should do 10 pushups (adjusted so they are HARDER) and 10 squats - with a weight. lololololololololololol.
No wonder people like me are scared away from working out. These websites make it sound like what we're able to do is embarrassingly insufficient. Even if that's true, it's 100x better to do a teeny tiny bit than to do nothing!
I know I've said this before, but there are so many websites that are like, "are you out of shape? Try running one minute and then walking one minute for thirty minutes! Hold a plank for 45 seconds!" People who are ACTUALLY OUT OF SHAPE cannot do these things!

@olyphil (For what it's worth: I agree that the man is a monster.)
@olyphil You were not just reporting it in your original tweet. You said that not only was he all these bad things, but he's also X, which equates X to those bad things. X was obesity. I know you hate him, but I hope you'll exercise caution, that's all. Thanks for reading.
@prominentplay @sarahhollowell 2. I FIRMLY disagree that people care about this because "he lies about everything." They CLEARLY care because he is fat and they equate fat with bad, and this is VERY clear from reading literally any commentary on Trump's weight.
@prominentplay @sarahhollowell 1. If you're going to use the health argument: do you really think Trump is going to drop dead during his presidency because he's 250 pounds and eats Big Macs? He's not. His body weight does not impact his decision-making, which is already a shit show.
I don't mean to be a pedant or a nag about the Trump obesity thing. But I do want everyone to think more about why they care so much that Trump is fat. And please don't forget what @sarahhollowell points out below.	https://t.co/SFJ4HgQNqP
@olyphil He is an awful man. It is not his food intake or his body shape that makes him this way.
@olyphil It is true that he is obese, sure! But does his body size or his junk food standard make him a worse president? If you believe there is a "different sensitivity standard" for his weight since he is president, you are implying there is something morally wrong with his body.
@jewishaction @laurenduca Thank you!!
@laurenduca @jewishaction Hey @jewishaction! I love you guys but the president being ‚Äúunfit,‚Äù out of shape, or obese is not a moral failing, and I hope you won‚Äôt RT this kind of stuff in the future. The president is a bad person and this is true regardless of his body shape or size.
40% of the United States is obese and there's mountains of research demonstrating that body-shaming us makes us physically and mentally sicker than just *not being a dick*, which actually takes fewer words! The president is an ASSHOLE and that's separate from his body shape.
@olyphil Since you regularly report on a sport in which the athletes are encourage to be as thin as possible to the point of starving themselves, not drinking water, and developing eating disorders, I hope you will be more careful with this kind of language in the future. Thanks!
@olyphil Hi Phil! I know you won't acknowledge this because of your weird internet rules, but wanted to remind you that body shaming is super unhelpful. The president could be fat or thin and would STILL be all those other things. Villainizing fat bodies hurts all of us.

@__quack this has been real hard for a lot of people
I've been really struggling with any industry-sponsored entertainment awards recently because the entertainment is not created for the people inside those industries, so for them to rank and vote on it feels kind of silly.
Drake is right		is a phrase I did not think I'd ever say
If you're a pop fan (but not usually a country fan), you should listen to Kelsea Ballerini's most recent album. She was never going to win Best Country Album but it's REALLY GOOD.
The Grammy producers who amped up the volume of a generic electric guitar instead of Arturo can suck it. (And as a result, I can go back to work!!)
I‚Äôm old now. I don‚Äôt know who any of the song of the year artists are, but I‚Äôm really pumped about Arturo Sandoval and Ricky Martin.
I‚Äôm sorry, did they get Arturo Sandoval to perform with Camila Cabello? How did they convince him to do this?!
...yeah. https://t.co/Lg0btlOJmP
@Erinsk8 That's literally the only way. They were at 69 and still have the highest PCS. That's why it took so long with the tech panel I imagine...
@Erinsk8 Can't.
Okay it was over a point, a take it back.
SO CLOSE, THAT IS BRUTAL
OH MY GOD
@Erinsk8 Weirdly I don't love W/P but there was a softness in their performance today that I don't think I've seen before (at least, on TV!). you guys can see speed in the arena far more clearly than we can on TV haha
That was the most I've ever liked W/P and the most I've ever liked G/P. Brilliance from both teams.
That's an awfully large number of 8s! üôÉ
@Erinsk8 WAIT IT ISN'T? I've been wondering why literally half the competitors having been making me cringe. Who allowed this!!!!
@Erinsk8 oh he did hit them!! I wasn't sure. yikes.
Slow, she tripped in the middle getting up from her knee slide, them staying in character is the only thing keeping me from totally checking out. I kind of expect better from these two.
I swear to go they are traveling backwards.
I realize that tango and flamenco are two totally different things from two totally different cultures but: must we?
üòç
Wang/Liu's free dance performances are Exhibit A of why it's annoying that judges don't separate choreography and interpretation scores from performance &amp; execution and skating skills.
Are there other ice dance couples so equally matched in star power? Wang/Liu are both SUPERSTARS.
@realdetective I've managed to not experience massive FOMO for most of this weekend but now that you've mentioned MASH, I'VE GOT IT BAD.

I support skating to Melissa Ethridge.
@Erinsk8 I'm suing the ISU.
Ah yes, because I was suffering from a headache during the short dance. Maybe due to the short dance.

He always skates very jump-to-jump in this program...maybe next year he'll be able to connect a little bit more. Maybe he'll also apologize for some stuff he did. I like him and want both these things!
Well - whatever the hell they've been doing with Vincent's quad lutz to get it fully around, it's working.
Imagine what we could have had if he had left Kori a few years earlier.
I'm so happy for him! &lt;333333333333333333333

@annmjensen I watched the entire event and I don't remember it *at all* which means you're probably right...
@BlondeAssassin1 yes he's actually decent! I'd literally never heard of him but I quite like him.
Who is this child and why is he 92387 times better than everyone else in this first group
The jumps were good!
I'm very happy for this guy because that was obviously very exciting for him, but that did not translate into four minutes of good 10:30pm television.
Men's groups 1&amp;2 free skates is why I do not watch normally watch Four Continents.

I honestly could've watched her skate that program for another 4 minutes.
Honestly that was spectacular. That 3A was beautiful and then she didn't even bother with the second, which I like a lot, and she skated with all the nuances in her music, and the whole thing was phenomenal. What a joy.
Holy fucking shit that was beautiful

Oh. My. God.

I still get uncomfortable when I watch this, and I know that‚Äôs on me not her, but.
@kimber1235 I thought she had been working on it for several years?
THEY CREDITED HER WITH A QUAD SAL, SO THAT'S COOL
@DadeMeghan in this case I very much appreciated the response üòÇ
@DadeMeghan Hello! I am also openly fair-weathered. I do love them as a general rule, but sometimes they drive me up the wall.
Mariah's Ashley Dress is giving me a lot of feelings.
Of course this is going to make things awfully difficult for The National Champion of My Heart‚Ñ¢
I don't like her at all but even I smiled at the end of that program. Nice to see something mostly clean!
@zmcadler I think they all do some variation of this, but for example, Raf at least WHISPERS it once they've sat down and doesn't bark it at them immediately. Tammy doesn't let us HEAR about it on TV.
Tom: "you don't want to let those performances get away from you." If I were a figure skater and that were the first thing my coach said as I got off the ice I'd be so annoyed. Like, OH REALLY? IS THAT WHAT I SHOULD NOT HAVE DONE? TELL ME MORE.
Oh my god the spiral screams
Oh no I just remembered that this program exists, excuse me she is a lovely skater but it's nearly 12:30am here.
@shoshpd @SamantHarrin Ooh I'm glad! It was not ideal on camera, but I like her so I'm happy for the excuse to let it go :)

@lbee329 I usually hate and completely skip this event and after two days I am thinking that is generally the right decision.
I *LOVE* Veronik - I have loved her for years - and I love Turning Tables. But this choreo is extremely questionable.
@lbee329 (also, this is my last competition of the season - I'll be missing Worlds, I missed Euros, I missed Nationals. I need my big event!)
@lbee329 Honestly, I've been staying up late to work the last few nights so I slept in this morning. otherwise I'd be CHECKED OUT.
@Erinsk8 And I *LOVE* Phantom. What a magic trick to make me want it to be over!
longest 4 minutes of my life
She has a TON of work to do but I also think she has a lot of potential. She clearly needs extra ballet time, but she should also keep skating to powerful music because she already skates so big!
SHE WAS GOOD @tripletoes ! YAY!! https://t.co/Ia5rzuFPyW
Cheering for Yi Christy Leung as loud as @tripletoes would want us to! (also because this program is fabulous)

I WAS WRONG, IT WAS MADI'S FAULT
lolllll H/D twitter is just me and Amanda now.
Madi looks way better than she has in the past but I'm gonna have to respectfully disagree with the judges on some of those GOE. üëÄ
That said: WAYYYYYY deeper edges than any team before them in all the places it didn't really matter.
So many level 2s. Door is WIDE open.
The judges just suddenly got really generous with the GOE for Piper and Paul (and I assume this group) and I'm kind of disappointed.
I did not enjoy that.		I have enjoyed very little of this.		I may be tapped out of rhythm dances for the season. (which is fine, since this is actually the last event I can watch üòî)
I sometimes wish Shiyue and Xinyu were pairs skaters so their skating skills wouldn't stop them from getting the scores I want them to get. üòî
That is SUBSTANTIALLY higher than I expected. Happy for them!
@dutchtogolden help I was happier in ignorance when I could just like my favorite teams and be irrationally angry at their scores
@notibid YAY good :D
@notibid I hope so, it looks pretty bad on tv.
not gonna get levels if your blades are flat.
@twizzaster if they don't pull it together soon, yes. and maybe even if they do.

It is not hard for most Americans to pronounce "Tim" correctly.
In an unusual twist, the tech panel is being moderately lenient and the JUDGES are being tough assholes, which I kind of LOVE. That's gonna be interesting with the top teams. Maybe we'll actually get a little score variation based on who had the best elements!

@sk8urheartout If John Zimmerman can't do it, though, can anyone?
Like this step sequence to really intense music should be FABULOUS, but they're skating small and slow. There HAS to be a coach who can get more out of them.
I feel like Haven and Brandon have so much potential and no one's been able to draw it out of them.

@SamantHarrin That was my first thought but the whole thing went downhill so fast that it's hard to care. üôà
14 year olds are allowed to be idiots, and it's their COACHES who should maybe not let them skate to overtly sexed up choreo. adult men can make their own damn decisions.

@Debsplaining oh no
@lbee329 @Debsplaining RIGHT it is REALLY BAD??? Who gave Mariah 7s in interpretation!?!?!?
@satokomiyaharas @perfectlonely I mean, I'll woo from home, but I promise I'll do it. :P
Currently feeling very badly for that Kazakh 16-year-old who came in 40-something at junior worlds last year - I'm guessing we're not going to be seeing his R&amp;J free skate. Any other bets for 25th place?
@perfectlonely @satokomiyaharas Ooh very cool! I'll cheer for him! :)

Ladies event: Awww, I love these skaters who are destined to come in last! I've watched them in three competitions this year!		Men's event: ...who?
@Debsplaining @lbee329 AS HE DESERVES
@lbee329 @Debsplaining This is eerily accurate. Like why am I so angry on Mariah's beha- OH NO
@Debsplaining @lbee329 Fully understood and on board! The Ashley-shaped hole in my heart will never be filled but at least Mariah can patch it a bit. Thank goodness.
@tripletoes He likes to get me riled up about skating but then realizes he‚Äôs made a mistake when I won‚Äôt shut up about it.
Matt just got home.		"Did Ashley win?"		üòí
This is my first time seeing Ashley do this kind of commentary and she's VERY good. Damn.
Things I've never said before: I'm genuinely glad I worked until the middle of the night last night so I could really focus on today's skating.
Performance execution, choreography, and interpretation-	BT:  8.54, 8.36, 8.43	MB: 8.18, 7.86, 7.93		No.
@SamantHarrin !!!!!!!!!!!!!
I just don't understand how the last three of Bradie's PCs are higher than Mariah's.
Remember when she was just one of those weird blonde girls who came in fifth in the short programs at nationals and then couldn't hold it together in the free
RT @inabauers: shes like trying but see now im annoyed bc this will outscore mariah when it shouldnt
An unusual and exciting day for US figure skating! https://t.co/R5eUHZWxSN
Confession: I love Bradie's short program. I dislike her performance of it, because she still can't quite move her body elegantly enough to make it work. But I do feel like it gets her closer to being an interesting figure skater.
@SamantHarrin I could definitely be on board with this! She seems sweet and fun! This graceful princess-y program thing is not working for her.
I HAVE A LOT OF QUESTIONS https://t.co/5KnnJkY7Ow
Her jumps are so good and she is so fast and I really want to like her! I'm trying! I'm just extremely failing quite a lot.
I have questions
Her jumps are so good but
The PC scores at this competition leave a lot to be desired.
When you get a 68 with no axel.
*popped. effectively very similar.
lol my twitter timeline is so far ahead of me that I can already tell Rika fell on her 3A and the program hasn't even started yet.

The dress is so good. Her hair is so good. Her makeup is so good. If Alaine needs to stop figure skating for a while she's welcome to come be my stylist.

@skating102 i love her i am not sorry
Hanul Kim, my fave Korean skater don't @ me!!!
ooof that second 3lo on replay.
CRUSHED. IT. YAY KAILANI!!!
Should...should someone tell Kailani that there's a snake on her back, or should we just let her keep skating?
Brooklee's expression and storytelling on the ice have improved drastically since I first remembering seeing her years and years ago. Good for her.

Sometimes I don't finish work in time for meetings and it turns out that if I had finished it, all of it would have been wasted because everything needed to be changed anyway. Maybe my "problem" is that I procrastinate on stuff that I am fully aware isn't any good.

@shellyjshore I can imagine it tbh
@turandont Yeah, this was too much of a missed opportunity NOT to critique it. It could've mattered so much.
@shellyjshore None of the live shows have had understudies, apparently, which is a thing I didn't know. Extreme #yikes. During "Will I," they moved the camera around the stage so fast that the whole thing was blurry. Such a shame for such a powerful moment. :(
RENT is problematic and imperfect and several million other things, but it's also beautiful and special, and it's quite clear why it touched so many people for so long. &lt;3

Also,@CelebrityCruise, the comedian was BEYOND sexist, extremely homophobic, and weirdly offensive about people‚Äôs bodies - on a CRUISE SHIP, where, let‚Äôs be real, this isn‚Äôt the thinnest group?
And the thought that someone in the audience was trans - or had perhaps been in the closet their whole life - and was hearing this made me so angry. Do better, @CelebrityCruise, and stop hiring comedians who think people‚Äôs identities are hilarious.
I understand that @CelebrityCruise is hiring comedians who appeal to an older crowd, but my 70 year old parents walked out with me, because being older isn‚Äôt an excuse to be a transphobic asshole, and they know it.
Last night, on my @CelebrityCruise vacation, I walked out of a show with a comedian who thought it was okay to make transphobic ‚Äújokes.‚Äù They weren‚Äôt funny and they were undoubtedly deeply harmful to someone in the audience.

You didn‚Äôt know John. You liked his skating and his commentary. Me too. 		And he abused people. SafeSport is NOT the problem. Reporters are NOT the problem. HE was the problem.
Grief is a monster. It‚Äôs hard to watch, but I know that some of these skaters are facing something really, really bad. But YOU are not having this experience. Acknowledge that someone you admired may have hurt people. And that it is NOT their fault.
I don‚Äôt have anything to say that hasn‚Äôt been said before. I‚Äôve just been very offline this weekend and every time I come back, it‚Äôs gotten worse and worse. Skaters I admire deleting comments? Skaters I try to appreciate acting like abuse victims are responsible for this?!
We owe our THANKS AND GRATITUDE to whomever reported John. That is SO HARD to do, and as a huge fan of John‚Äôs skating and commentary, I‚Äôm FURIOUS at him that his choice to end his life resulted in a complete lack of closure for those people.
It is truly atrocious to behave as though the three separate individuals who reported their abuse did ANYTHING wrong. SafeSport acted appropriately, and THANK GOD.
I feel for people who knew John and are truly grieving. I‚Äôm willing to offer them a pass. I hope that later, they acknowledge if they‚Äôve made mistakes while grieving publicly. I am NOT willing to extend this courtesy to randos who blame reporters or SafeSport.

Hi wait I‚Äôm sorry CANADIAN NATIONALS RESULTS ARE CRAZY

I am still a massive procrastinator, but I am happy to report that *not working all the time and not feeling guilty about it* is the best thing I have ever done for myself. I recognized myself in the burnout piece because that's who I used to be. "I'm strong! I don't need rest!"
But then, over a year ago, I legitimately got burned out. I got back from vacation and my depression kicked in. And I realized that maybe I needed to actually sit down and watch a goddamn TV show. (HGTV in the background of doing work doesn't count.)
For my entire life, I have imagined myself to be a person who doesn't need that. "Sleep is overrated," I repeated (over and over again) in college. And, "I can do this! I'll just work constantly!"
A few years ago a therapist pointed out that maybe I would procrastinate less if I actually gave myself intentional downtime. Not just, "let's do something fun!" time, like when I was figure skating. Like, SITTING ON MY ASS downtime.
I already loved @annehelen and her Facebook group was already my favorite thing on the internet. But that burnout article hit really close to home and I can't stop thinking about it.

@SamantHarrin Having health insurance mostly covered is honestly one of the best reasons to work in a traditional office. 		Of course, this shouldn‚Äôt need to be a thing, so...
@team_pdd Well apparently the space is small enough that you only have to pay the house cleaner for 30 minutes...
@SamantHarrin This one actually makes sense to me, if you‚Äôre making $100k your premium is probably even less tbh
@arabesquing I get it, moving from dc to here was confusing.
@arabesquing That seems debateable.
@arabesquing That‚Äôs feasible in Pittsburgh tbh (when I moved here I capped my rent budget at $800) but if you‚Äôre making $100k you definitely want something slightly nicer that what you can get for $825...

@Em_Wilmes I understand in theory why you are watching this game (this is a decent rivalry, too, actually) but also this team went 0-18 in the ACC last year so I recommend you clean your bathroom or pick lint off your leggings or something more fun.

This program is SO GOOD.
I...did not watch that.
I've had an atrocious headache since I woke up for work this morning and I'm not sure rhythm dances followed by pairs skating is going to do much for improving that.
The double whammy of buying a Chromecast plus having an app for figure skating has made it SO much more pleasant to set up for a night of hunkering down and watching bad rhythm dances.
@Debsplaining I think I remember seeing it at Worlds in Boston and being like "why is this happening to me"

Putting athletes at risk like this is completely unacceptable.
Athletes are trained to get up and keep going, and if they've had a possible concussion they certainly do not have the mental capacity to know that they should stop. That's why there NEEDS to be an impartial person - like, oh hey, a ref! - who can say, "you're done."
I'm just seeing what happened to Ashley Cain right now, holy cow, I can't believe the ref didn't stop the program!?
@HonestToddler This is lovely and makes me really happy :)

@JoyofEmily I'm honestly half-waiting for the real skating to start. I might be a fake fan.
Post-Olympic years are so strange.
Her flip is also much better than the other Eteri girls. The entrance probably helps.
YESSSSSSSSS
She is a star, and he's there too!
This 15-year-old girl is a star, and this dude is doing a great job of making sure she gets all the attention. Also their acrobatics are the coolest.
@team_pdd This music does not match this skating.
Let's replace the music with the AOL modem startup sounds and see if they notice.
I just don't understand why you would skate to Interstellar and pick those sections of the score.
WHAT IS HAPPENING TO TED'S VOICE
Tomoki is a great spinner, maybe he and Camden can help each other out.
well, uh, congrats to Camden for his lead, I guess.
It's hard to watch other skaters now. They drop arms down. Camden PLACES his arms down. It's a huge distinction.
Better than so many of the senior men. There HAS to be a GOE and PCS increase for his beautiful, thoughtful, INTENTIONAL movement. If we're not rewarding that, we might have a problem. https://t.co/SvWSPQebIu

@callofthewind I'm pretty sure "letting the goyim sweat it out" is my other favorite hobby tbh. Pretty sure we should be allowed to work through Christmas and take Rosh and Yom Kippur as paid holidays, though.
My favorite winter hobby: informing people that Hannukah is one of the least important holidays on the Jewish calendar and also that the "oil lasted eight nights" thing was probably made up to cover that we're actually celebrating winning a war.

...b) make it BETTER by contributing our lived experiences and making sure we're asking the right questions and getting useful answers.		That's all. Rant over until I get angry again about how we presume everyone should take the stairs as if everyone is equally-abled.
I'm not saying skinny people shouldn't do obesity research - I'm just wondering why the space is so unwelcoming to the fat people who would a) actually benefit from the work and...
And I should edit that last one to say both the mental health AND physical health impacts of the stigma - since we know that increased cortisol due to stress actually causes additional weight gain. üôÉ
We spent all week talking about "lived experience" but I never saw a single conversation about the mental health impacts of the stigma of being fat, just a bunch of skinny people telling me why being fat was killing me.
So I have a fun takeaway from APHA this week: literally all of the obesity and fitness research and practice work is conducted by thin people. That'd be like if only white people did equity work: fucking insane.

WHAT SHOW CAN I WATCH? I rarely enjoy tv or movies but this show gave me all the good happy feelings and constant laughter and I don‚Äôt know what to do now that I‚Äôm almost done, except rewatch all the key Leslie and Ben moments until Netflix asks if I‚Äôm okay.
A fun side effect of being too tired to function is that I have no cycles through Parks and Rec, from the episode when Ben and Leslie get together to the end of season 6, and then season 2 to that episode again (and again and again omg). So now I need help:

@quadlutze The design is EXACTLY the red purple one though, it‚Äôs like a perfect combo of her 2016-2017 dresses.
@BlondeAssassin1 She wore this color exactly at both GPs and that design is EXACTLY what she had in the second half. I swear we saw this dress but I can‚Äôt find the competition.
@annmjensen Lisa McKinnon makes all of Ashley‚Äôs dresses but I know for a fact this is Ashley‚Äôs pattern from the second half of 2016-2017 and the color from the first. I thought there was a dress in between that shared them and that this was it, but I could be wrong?
Okay wait. Is it not Ashley‚Äôs dress? She wore that color for the GP series and then a red/purple version of Mariah‚Äôs for Nationals and Worlds. Maybe it‚Äôs just Ashley‚Äôs design but made for Mariah? Or am I forgetting a competition?
@BlondeAssassin1 Right?!!?? It is literally hers that‚Äôs awesome

@team_pdd there was a step sequence ?
The Havdallah service during the vigil was incredibly emotional for me and a lot of other people - I walked past a man holding his young son and just openly sobbing. I'm lucky that I was safe enough to be there and I'll keep praying for the people who were not. https://t.co/7zDRqTaKoM
Wait they. The won the free dance.		Um?
1. This dress is terrible for this program. 2. This dress is terrible. 3. Why Bach. WHY. 4. The intricacies in this program are actually pretty cool, damn them.
@skating102 https://t.co/JMgcj5UhPV
@JoyofEmily In general? Nope! Compared to the last one? That‚Äôs a low bar. :)
This program is so funny, it‚Äôs like, here‚Äôs one section. Here‚Äôs another. Here‚Äôs another! I‚Äôm not used to being able to identify the beginning and the end of everything and I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs good.
I see her lingerie+boyfriend‚Äôs shirt costume is gone.
I take that back. The floppy arms when she dies at the end are EXTREMELY memorable.
Okay the character step sequence is actually pretty good but I think that‚Äôs the only memorable thing in this program.
Their skating is to die for but I‚Äôm going to die from boredom in this program instead.
@nolovenoglorys I literally have never cared less about a skater‚Äôs skating skills in my life. I love them.
@team_pdd UGH FOR REAL, we all know their edges and skating aren‚Äôt the best and NO ONE CARES! They‚Äôre ABSOLUTE STARS
Ugh this stupid TES box pointing out their mediocre edges. Rude. This performance is a masterpiece.

I hope this team gets really good in 10 years so I can dig up these tweets and be like ‚ÄúBUT REMEMBER THE BEGINNING‚Äù
Just like in the rhythm dance, none of this team‚Äôs choreo had anything to do with the music. Except here, the music was the world‚Äôs worst cover of ‚ÄúBad,‚Äù followed by weird edited MJ, and they both fell over on a lift. Hot. Mess.
This is such a hot mess. I may watch it again.
It‚Äôs too late to go back to real Michael, you already ruined it.

Vanessa and Morgan doing that program right now was such a gift. There are a few weird moments in the past years when I've watched skating and an early-season performance made me lose it for various reasons and I haven't forgotten any of them. I'm never going to forget this one.
@SamantHarrin thank you, I needed this reminder &lt;3333333
I'm sobbing
You know how sometimes you're already crying about something and then something makes you even more emotional and you can't stop sobbing? That's what just happened here.
This is a good way to explain it. Pittsburgh is REALLY tiny. I go to a synagogue just a few blocks away from this one. I go to the JCC gym and the CVS and a tailor and a psychiatrist in that neighborhood and I get tea in that neighborhood. This is close to home for all of us. https://t.co/J8Xi3yQkd0

Hey, pairs skaters? I'm kinda counting on you here. Pick it up a little please.
Also, weirdly grateful the baseball game went until 3:30 in the morning. Matt was planning to go to our gym this morning - we belong to the JCC in Squirrel Hill. He would have been safe, but that would have been incredibly scary.

Someone help me before I turn into a Z/G stan.
I want to like this team so badly because I can see that they are technically quite fabulous, and I really appreciate their precision. The program is just not...finished. Maybe by the end of the season, but I don't know they've ever been super impressed by them.

I really like this program!
@Debsplaining Oh right they did all wear pants for that, but oh my god, the ISU actually said that and everyone was like "cool" and we all went about the season as if that wasn't a weird thing to say *at best*? great!
@8Annita not at all, no. and her lines aren't fabulous to begin with.
@Debsplaining She's actually not, right? I don't remember the rules but it's too bad because pants would help quite a bit...
Hahahahahahaha Tanith just straight up compared this to the #TeamHotItalians program from last season and said that it doesn't actually compare at all.
The black skates cut off her legs and make her lines look shorter, which is not something she needed help with.
If you had, "what are spoken words during a free dance on the Grand Prix circuit," congrats, you're right! And also, you're lying, there's no way you could've made this up. https://t.co/rXF9pbUdEU
Wow two programs in a row that didn‚Äôt leave me bored to death, are we sure this is post-Olympic season ice dance?
THE SHORT LENGTH CHARACTER STEPS I CAN'T
i just screamed in my apartment
THE SLOW LEG TURN FROM KARINA IS SO GOOD I CAN'T GET OVER IT
Just now realizing that the rhythm dance ended at 10:30pm PT and the free dance is starting at 11am PT. These organizers, man.
@8Annita It's going to be part of a series about people playing hooky from their jobs for two weeks üòú
@furiosalizabeth On purpose? Well done! üí™üí™
Jackie is literally wearing my winter uniform though: Rocker hoodie, jeans, black Nike sneakers. They do say to dress for the job you want!
@team_pdd @rockerskating @NickMcCarvel Both look ready for another 12 hour day of figure skating. Bless them. üôå
@team_pdd @rockerskating @NickMcCarvel I'm Jackie showing up to an event in jeans and a hoodie while my colleague is wearing a suit.
@punksalchow This really is and was a surprise, though, every time I see it.
Their twizzles aren‚Äôt good. Why do they keep getting good GOE on the twizzles.
I don‚Äôt like them that much, even though I really want to, but that was extremely technically strong. Good for them.
They‚Äôre crushing these patterns!!
A COSTUME DEDUCTION
Zach is undressing in the kiss and cry and I‚Äôm not sad...?
Tanith thinks it‚Äôs important that they draw their passion from an ORGANIC place. Why not authentic.
Of course they did that.
RT @shoshpd: Find an authentic ending pose and stay there.
Oh hey here I am properly assigning levels to this pattern.
@nolovenoglorys Rude autocorrect ruined my hashtag
@nolovenoglorys #never forget
I like them, but I don‚Äôt like this program for them. They need a little more room to be weird. They probably could‚Äôve included some choreography that reflected that.
LEVEL FOUR ON THE SECOND PATTERN
#onbrand https://t.co/RJohUomaC7
I love this dress.
These teams are very bad at this pattern. It is not fun to watch.
@amanda_prahl And Hallelujah was their short, too.
@amanda_prahl https://t.co/Mf5AKOGDeU
@amanda_prahl I just kind of hate it. Nothing real, just whining. :)
I‚Äôm still angry at Madi and Zach for their free skate.
@caroline4pres Oh no
@qiutians It‚Äôd be cool to understand it for once üôà
@HRHtheDentist But I do understand that those key points include correct edges and correct change of edges. If they‚Äôre flat they‚Äôre not getting levels.
That was REALLY fast - lots of power across the ice compared to the other teams in this group. And higher levels because of better edges (I *think*).
I‚Äòm starting to feel like I understand these pattern levels a little bit ?
Yikes that first pattern was visibly not good to my untrained eye. Better twizzles. Glorious lift. üòç
@shoshpd oh great glad to hear they haven't improved in the slightest
There is literally no way I make it through this event.
@shoshpd @team_pdd I love this so much :)
@team_pdd YESSSS &lt;3
@shoshpd @team_pdd YESSS I was hoping it was you guys! :D I assume with the flag?
Who did Joe just point at?
@qiutians They're definitely related to someone. That's the only way. Otherwise that's just torture.
They have media trained Bradie and she sounds much better now. At least USFS did SOMETHING right. Good work on that.
MORE 9S FOR PCS PLEASE
It's actually INSANE how much better she is than everyone else and it isn't even close.
I'm sorry but if this doesn't go into the lead by MILES she has been totally robbed. It's like a new fucking event. She is BEYOND.
Satoko is superior to everyone else in this field. This is like watching another competition.
She just entirely lacks nuance...
@SamantHarrin Ooh I like this! They need to develop something that highlights her strengths, Shae is better at that than anyone.
She's doing all the right things but...? ? ? ?
@SamantHarrin Yeah fair the dress is fabulous
This is a ridiculous style for her, she isn't delicate enough for this.
they're just putting all the skaters I'm bitter about in a row
That's a LOT of PCS for Bradie üëÄ
They're consistent in talking about her consistency. https://t.co/eZDUhtijHS
A thing I see time and time again with Bradie is that it takes her a while to really start getting into it and performing. It was like this even at Stars on Ice - she's a robot until halfway through. She needs that intensity through the whole program.
Tara and Johnny skipped the Japan Open just like I did, apparently
I really like this music and I want to like her so badly so I stop having all these negative feelings please help me like you
+5 for Loena's eye makeup.
I don't care about her score, she's perfect and I love her.
Okay that toe was more under than I thought it was :(
MARIN FUCKING HONDA
Wow she got robbed on that layback spin...
GIVE MARIN ALL THE POINTS AND ALSO WHATEVER ELSE SHE COULD POSSIBLY EVER WANT &lt;3333333333
HAVE YOU EVER SEEN SUCH A STAR
come on Marin PLEASE &lt;3
Her arms are SO BAD going into the 3-3.
@lbee329 She also added visible makeup to her look, she was wearing a lot less of it in 2013.
I hope this goes behind Megan don't @ me
@lbee329 (But really, it‚Äôs just late.)
@lbee329 I mean...she lost all her skaters and the ones who went to her kinda suck... and her face knows it.
Tara, if they're slowing down during the step sequence, that isn't necessarily a good thing.
I am not usually opposed to Tanos in general but YIKES that was ugly.
Kori has aged a lot since the 2013-2014 season. It's been a rough few years for her.
Bradie's dress is not okay.
@lbee329 they're amazing
Oh shit her jumps flew to Seattle with her?! üëç
I genuinely detest every version of this song except this one.
Alaine's hair and makeup today are fabulous, this is a better visual package than she's had in the past.
Someone compared her to Gracie a few years ago and I kind of can't unsee it.
@Debsplaining @vesperteacup https://t.co/GitT2d9nNS
...Alaine is also wearing a very similar color.
Follow me for important makeup commentary.
Megan and Sofia are wearing very similar lipstick colors.
AWWW I'M SO HAPPY FOR HER, THIS IS A GOOD DEBUT, especially for someone who was so heavily doubted coming into this thing (...by me). GOOD JOB GIRL!
SHE GOT A 3-3? WE HAVE ANOTHER GIRL WITH A FUNCTIONAL 3-3? I GUESS THIS IS WHY THEY SENT HER HERE BUT OMG WHAT
"crowd is immediately into it" okay that was probably just patrick tara
oh boy. here we go.
@punksalchow we r who we r tho
I feel like she's a little young for this corset back but I can't get over how much I love this dress.
@Xanboni @vesperteacup I regularly find them annoying but this was a particularly egregious comment.
@vesperteacup Yeah it's totally possible and I wouldn't be shocked, but "clear favorite" feels a like a bit much...
Bradie is a "clear favorite" even though two-time world medalist and fourth-place Olympian Satoko Miyahara is here. Okay.
@HRHtheDentist shhhhh this doesn't happen of course not
It's really nice to develop genuine appreciation for skaters as they grow and learn and get better.
My favorite thing about skating is that it is the one element of my life where I am 100% willing to be convinced of anything, all the time. I go from hating skaters to loving them over the course of a season or even competition (and sometimes back again).
@tripletoes I think about that podium a lot. Mostly the bottom of it. üò¨
None of these 2014 GP Finalists went to South Korea. https://t.co/VenXReZOV7
Every time commentators talk about how the skaters are using the post-Olympic Grand Prix to set themselves up for 2022, remember that none of the 2014 ladies GPF medalists competed at the 2018 Olympics. https://t.co/c67MpDymJx
Does someone need to remind Liza that the short program also counts?
RAF IS SO HAPPY FOR HIS SKATERS THIS IS THE CONTENT I'M HERE FOR &lt;3

sorry gonna be stuck on nathan chen forever
Hey did you guys know that Nathan Chen is good at figure skating
NATHAN MOTHERFUCKING CHEN
@team_pdd Deserved. Yike. Whatever I don‚Äôt care he‚Äôs the best ahhhhh!
RT @quadlutzes: doing a full courseload at yale while competing at the highest level in figure skating? what, like it's hard? https://t.co/‚Ä¶
HE IS SO GOOD HE IS SO GOOD HOLY SHIT HE IS SO GOOD
NATHAN CHEN IS GOOD AT FIGURE SKATING!!!!!!!!!!!!
I am a hardcore fan of ASHLEY ELISABETH UNDERROTATION WAGNER. I know what it looks like when a jump doesn't get fully around!
"How his blade naturally hits the ice" YES, IT NATURALLY HITS THE ICE TOO EARLY
RT @Erinsk8: It doesn‚Äôt help Vincent OR the viewer for Johnny and Tara to insist his underrotated jumps aren‚Äôt underrotated.
this step sequence is kind of a huge letdown
These are beautiful jumps but a lot of them are under, and claiming that they're not isn't going to help him get better.
I genuinely can't imagine trying to skate a program that Denis has choreographed right now. It must be very difficult to bring that to competition and try to give it the energy and life they imagined when they were working together.
It's deeply, deeply unfair that Denis isn't able to see his work come to life in competition.
I wasn't prepared and I started crying.
@lbee329 I remember them doing this then too, which is ridiculous because it is equally as unimportant now as it was 2000-2007.
@BlondeAssassin1 @tripletoes growing up there, the best days were taking the train into the city, so...
@tripletoes @BlondeAssassin1 yes there we go, we are the three people who have heard of the place Jimmy Ma is from, WHY does Terry keep mentioning it!
@BlondeAssassin1 We're two of the three!
I like that Terry keeps emphasizing that Jimmy's from Great Neck. There's only like three of us who know where Great Neck is.
I still absolutely love the choreo though and I think he's really strong. Jimmy Ma's gonna come back and crush it. (Please come back and crush it.)
I know we're all "Jimmy Ma does Turn Down For What" but I think this style suits him really well and I love this free skate for him. This particular performance, on the other hand...
Yikes, -4.75 GOE is the stuff of nightmares.
@shoshpd it's extremely helpful to have to company while i grieve.

@hannahskates96 It's gonna hurt so badly but she was so light and airy and I want to see that again. (also if that's her last competitive program ever.......)
@callofthewind I've been considering it recently. Watching Nam makes me remember how much better this music can me...
Raise your hand if you still haven't rewatched Ashley's performance from January even though you think it was among her best performances ever. üôã

Rain is currently blowing horizontally outside my window so I'm suddenly not terribly sad to be stuck at home putting together this presentation.
@SamantHarrin I think we have your wind now.
@Em_Wilmes üôå
important update: SHE DID IT üéâ https://t.co/teunJELXHx
this is very russian
I love this program so much. It needs to be clean to be exceptional because their strength is in their precision. But I'm super pumped about the potential of this.
I LOVE THESE COSTUMES FOR ONCE
@JoyofEmily @8Annita @Em_Wilmes oh my goodness i am so sorry üòÇ
@Em_Wilmes @8Annita Honestly though, twitter gets a pass because there is no legit reason you would have any idea.
Important interruption from skating to bring you: WE BEAT LEHIGH https://t.co/X9RxVBLNeS
@utterfrivolity @Debsplaining Hahahahahahah I'm sorry for messing things up up north üôà
@8Annita @Em_Wilmes My friend from Iowa one day was like HELP ME DO THIS RIGHT and it took a while üòÇ but that particular thing doesn't bother me because we all pronounce words differently. I'm just annoyed when people use the other name spelled the same way.
Dammit, that was good and I enjoyed it even though I desperately wanted to hate it.
@SamantHarrin I am legitimately LOLing oh my god üòÇ
@utterfrivolity Yes, mine is basically the east coast variation of your -ara :)
I'm not supposed to be watching this
I very much understand why they chose these costumes but I also would never have made this decision in a million years.
@missmaraskate üöó-uh versus üòº-uh basically :)
@Em_Wilmes lolol there is legitimately no reason you would be saying it correctly, you've never heard me pronounce it!
@Em_Wilmes It's actually tricky for people outside of NY because in addition to not being the same as Mara Wilson, you have to separate the first A from the R, instead of combining them like "mare-uh." Mah - ruh. üòÇ
@utterfrivolity I used to joke that it's "Ma" as in "cat," "Ra" as in "DUH." :) How do you say your name?
@missmaraskate hahahahahahahahahaah i love this and you are the only person allowed to have this reaction &lt;3
@Em_Wilmes I used to joke that it's "Ma" as in "cat," "Ra" as in "DUH." :) So...you know Mara Wilson? not like her.
(If you're reading this out loud in your head, there is a 100% chance you are pronouncing my name wrong, unless you're the people who let me correct you that one time &lt;3)
If I were a figure skater, the worst moment of every event would be the introductions, where the announcers in every country, including my own, would mispronounce my name, and I'd yell back, "It's MAra, you idiots!"
Her lipstick is good though.
Alexa looked this off yesterday, too. Something's up.
I love literally every iteration of this song that has ever been recorded but this is not the version I would've picked for Alexa and Chris.
@Em_Wilmes neither are they
@StylishDreaming it's a real thing, right? like, it's too much and it doesn't work until he becomes human.
@PitHoyaFan88 If they had just looked like they didn't hate themselves the program could have been good!!!!
@Em_Wilmes She just did it again in the entrance to the death spiral, what a tease.
@Erinsk8 Her back is spectacular.
Hold your damn spiral positions.
Okay honestly...he‚Äôs almost too hot? To the point where I‚Äôm not attracted to him. He‚Äôs very generic movie star looking, idk. If he decides to give any face during this season I reserve my right to revoke this because I will definitely find that adorable.
@Em_Wilmes Her eyeshadow is the only thing that made any sense for the last four minutes.
Literally only watching this program because he‚Äôs hot, I have too much work to waste time on crashy twist landings and disaster triple toes.
Her eyeshadow is very good.

What are his arms doing though
I didn't realize Alexei came in 4th at Worlds...?		(I watched approximately two programs from Worlds and they were both Nathan's.)
seriously though Nathan is too good to have camel spins like that, I hope Raf yells at him over facetime for the rest of fall semester.
would never have guessed from watching this üôÉ https://t.co/FD8PDROkNm
Lol after Nathan‚Äôs program everything is boring.
@wjn_7 @JennyRogers11 I‚Äôm terrified but when am I not, really
Omg do you think Raf is yelling at him
@wjn_7 @JennyRogers11 said the same thing earlier üòÇ
I HOPE RAF YELLS AT HIM FOR HIS TERRIBLE CAMEL SPINS BUT WHATEVER THAT WAS SUPER FUN AND I FUCKING LOVE HIM
FUCK THIS PROGRAM IS SO GOOD
Lol Nathan your spins.
a;soidfja;eoifja;eofijae;ofija e;foijaw;eofi

bronwyn's train of thought during morisi's program is really helpful because my brain was just going "asofijapwoefijaeofij" instead of words https://t.co/olGIbx46uU
Well that was SOMETHING
Says the music, sure, but the COSTUME https://t.co/fKV6zBoZEV
WOW that is a low score.
@Debsplaining I would've probably given him the axel but them arguing that it's a perfect program is absurd.
no, tara and johnny, the quad lutz was under, the reason it looked weird and funky is because it was not fully rotated, this is not difficult
I think the quad flip was rotated but the quad lutz was DEFINITELY under, I don't care what Tara and Johnny say.
(also the quad combo looked under)
even ashley made this empty crossover section more interesting.
@skating102 such a good moment
EXTREME SHADE FROM TERRY @ TARA, WHO BROKE MY HEART WHEN SHE LEFT, SHE DESERVED THAT
Omg did he just trip getting off his knee
Oh yeah I forgot how mad Nam‚Äôs programs make me.

raf cam
that's because your opinion was bad, johnny.
AWESOME skate from Julian! That was fantastic!		(except the entrance into the flip-toe, eek)
Did Julian get faster or is Jimmy just slow
Johnny is doing an awful job explaining the -5 to +5...
(the problem is not him I just don't think the program is all that great, I obviously think he's fabulous)
(I don't actually like the second half of this short program and I like his free skate much better, don't @ me.)
Jimmy Ma, my hometown boy
oh no
RT @__heck: #SkateAmerica https://t.co/3VVGdmw9P1
@amanda_prahl I loved those awful costumes if they had just PRETENDED TO BE OKAY WITH IT it could‚Äôve been so good and I don‚Äôt even mean that ironically hahahhaahhaah
@skating102 I haven‚Äôt checked what they‚Äôre doing...I‚Äôm ready for this surprise and horror.
I'm not really sure what any of the choreo had to do with the music but at least they don't hate themselves so...steps forward!
@amanda_prahl I think this is far more embarrassing tbh...
I've always really liked them but last year was a MESS all around and they were just crazy overscored, I'm excited to see them look more together this year.
It's nice that they picked a fun program and decided not to look embarrassed about it this time.
this event is a hot mess. hot, in that the skaters are hot. a mess, in that it sucks.
yes there were issues with this program but honestly give them an extra 5 points for this alone because it was AMAZING https://t.co/2pRGQPwCMe
Omg her back outside edge out of that lift!!!!! üòçüòçüòçüòçüòç
What is even happening with Alexa and Chris right now? They don't have their coach, Chris landed a 3S but Alexa didn't even take off at the same time and did a 2.5, she tripped on his blade...
I love this song but it does not explain the costumes.
They‚Äôre really skating to Castle huh
Omg wait this is their short music??????
@TeamJFSA no idea, we don't get it here, but they did say that.
@amanda_prahl I'm extremely confused how they looked in the mirror and were like, "yup, this was the right choice."
@caroline4pres delete this
@amanda_prahl no
"welcome back to the Olympic channel" well that explains the commercials.
@Em_Wilmes Very much agree.
@lbee329 He‚Äôs almost 26 but she‚Äôs definitely a baby so this could work.

Well I guess immorally obligated to like this team, even though her dress is going on my terrible costume Twitter.
@caroline4pres I‚Äôm not even really hearing Beatles tbh
@Debsplaining Kinda seems like it. With the NBC music every time. It‚Äôs giving me nationals anxiety.
@skating102 22, I already checked. Obviously.
He is strong and I‚Äôm interested in that.
These breaks in between program and replays and scores are gonna get real annoying real fast.
@punksalchow I wasn't sure I heard that correctly but apparently!
@tripletoes yes, it's VERY annoying to see things pop up on twitter first.
@twizzaster literally LOLing at this tweet
Um, this team has actually improved a lot since nationals last year, can we get them a program that isn't a total snoozefest?
@JoyofEmily OMG üòÇ but like. fair.
@JoyofEmily yessss, it's so annoying, they work too hard to wear such sad costumes.
@twizzaster i didn't know that, and moving forward i'm going to continue to pretend i don't know that.
I'm going to start a twitter feed called "I Hate Your Costume" and it's just going to be pictures of everyone wearing a dress with thinner material than the lingerie nightgowns I saw in VS last week.

@Debsplaining @StylishDreaming I can‚Äôt decide if this is mainly a sign that we‚Äôre sick enough for it to be visible or if people react badly the second anyone looks like they might be slightly tired.
@StylishDreaming To be fair, the one who looked at me for three seconds also asked if I was okay, and it's not like she was wrong this time hahahahaa. thank you, i'm sure i will soon. just a dumb head cold, thankfully!

Not to take away from Jorik, but it's particularly brave of Karina to come out considering how few female figure skaters have been out while competing. That she's done this in what appears to be her and Joe's breakout season is even more amazing.

@bigcurlsenergy i'm going to hate the fighting forever, i'm not here to watch people get dropped and i think it's a bad part of the culture and maybe it's innate but it's still bad.
@bigcurlsenergy everyone in hockey kind of does suck. stop punching each other and play!!!!!
@bigcurlsenergy lol no i'm going to forget that brad marchand did this in like three days. I think every individual player who participates in the culture should get called out but ultimately I know it's not unique to him or anything like that!
I don't really like Dusty all that much but this is pretty obviously correct. Hiring a guy who's never done the job before for a win-now year was a bold choice and a mistake. https://t.co/3ItVyJIXu7
@bigcurlsenergy I've been consistent in all of my sports on "people who show up others might be assholes but don't deserve to get punched." My favorite example is anthony rizzo, who screamed a dumb thing in the postseason at my team last year, but doesn't deserve to get hit by a pitch.
@bigcurlsenergy Reasonable people can disagree on what is good or bad, but if I dropped everything I liked because I didn't like one element of its culture, the bad things would never change or go away, which seems like a problem.
@bigcurlsenergy For what it's worth, I think hockey is better when they stop killing each other and just play. I'm not going to stop watching it because sometimes they do a thing I don't like. I'd have to stop watching or doing anything I actually enjoy.
@bigcurlsenergy sorry for calling you out here, that was probably unnecessary. this attitude frustrates me because it suggests that we should ignore things when we dislike an aspect of the culture, which i think is silly. "physically hurting someone for showing me up" is my #1 dislike in sports.
The "stop celebrating" rule is the dumbest thing I've ever seen in my life and if you believe you should impose it on another team by punching the celebrator and making him bleed from his head (or, say, hitting him with a pitch!), you suck and I hate you. https://t.co/5NDKAbrcm7

The weirdest thing about all this is I'm not opposed to a Supreme Court justice who has committed crimes (especially as a kid) and demonstrated repentance. But this is not that! Also, he's a dick and a liar even without the sexual assault he's not admitting, so.

I made several mistakes, too, in high school and in college, by sometimes reaction the wrong way when people told stories. I have fuzzy memories of saying the stupidest shit ever. No wonder more people don't come forward.
I did believe them, but one of my friends also told me about a good friend who *didn't* believe her, and I never again had to question why women don't report these experiences.
There was a period in my life - maybe about a year long - when like 5-6 women I knew told me about their sexual assaults (all occurring within that year) because I seemed like I would believe them. They didn't know where else to go.

aren't you glad that's my takeaway while everyone else is freaking out about The Americans
There's literally no way Antoni could do a ceviche cool
HASHTAG NOT ALL MEN, BUT A LOT OF THEM
dammit why am i crying.
What was he gonna do if he lost?
that is an awfully public proposal.
John &lt;3 But Sam &lt;/3
Darren Criss winning an Emmy Award. oh my god.
YES PLEASE https://t.co/WBwIvhOY4A
The local news commercial just said, in SCARY VOICE, "the safety measures that could have stopped this scary camel incident. Tonight at 11." #Pittsburgh
Yes, this. https://t.co/MIBcgldigl
@jonfeng1 Temporary files and random shit that was being held by Windows which I have running through parallels! hallelujah.
Why are the only comedy nominees from SNL, and why is Jimmy Kimmel still here and how do we get rid of him?
I just reclaimed nearly 60 gigs of space on my hard drive, this went from being a terrible day to being the best day ever.
@greg_otto Yes, apparently we can be out of touch at literally any age. üíÅ
I have the Emmys on but I've never heard of any of these shows...
@tripletoes omg wait they can't replace illuminations &lt;/3
@vailkoyo @SeucT Relatable.
he hurt his reputation on his own without any help from anyone else. https://t.co/Q59wduR5xG
@shoshpd hahahaha okay yes I agree in theory but sometimes I reread this Reductress piece because it brings me so much joy: https://t.co/G0uJLtsjoT
This is so aggressively thirsty and I can't even really argue because who among us hasn't been like "REMEMBER ME I EXIST" to a cute boy https://t.co/Nh2cmGfj75
Women in the news not having the best weekend. https://t.co/bTxLklkbh2
Do Republicans know that they're not obligated to stick with this guy? They can be like "whoops, guess he's a creep" and move onto another terrible conservative asshole who hopefully hasn't tried to rape someone.
@lbee329 Way to stay on brand.
@caroline4pres I obviously don't know the context for this but out of context it is wonderful
Good to know this is going to happen forever!! https://t.co/Ilqn90IWlD
Matt is going to this de Grom-Sale matchup in Boston and I am insanely jealous. https://t.co/6wSnszxkfj
RT @Iwillleavenow: *to the tune of Destiny's Child's "Say My Name"*		SPELL MY NAME, SPELL MY NAME	IT'S RIGHT THERE IN THE EMAIL	IT'S NOT A‚Ä¶
Just swiped through three separate insta stories from friends and acquaintances at the HRC dinner, featuring Adam Rippon. I‚Äôm usually annoyed by randos being like ‚Äúomg I love him‚Äù but the lgbtq community deserves an athlete like Adam. ‚ù§Ô∏è
Adding to the range of GOEs didn't do anything but make the judging disagreements seem even bigger. Skating is subjective, so that has *some* value, but some of this is a little insane. #USIntlClassic
@lbee329 I remember the exact moment when I wrote this particular tweet. If she continues to skate like that it might be worth reading my tweets instead of watching her.
The big ranges are interesting, but the big IQRs demonstrate more consistent disagreement among the judges about the value of an element. It's not like one judge went wild in that second set of ranges - that's a type of average. #USIntlClassic
SFor fun, I did a full sweep of the ladies' FS at #USIntlClassic. The biggest range in GOE goes to:	C Hicks, 3f-3lo, 6	S Miyahara, 2a-3t, 5	Y Kim, StSq3, 5	J Taljegard, 2f-2lo-2lo, 5		The biggest IQR:	C Hicks, 3f-3lo, 3	S Miyahara, 2a-3t, 3	K Pasfield, FCCoSp4, 3
Honestly at this point what's most fun isn't the full range, it's the IQR, which continues to be mindbogglingly wide.
@team_pdd Thanks, ISU, for giving us this fun activity! üòí
The GOE spread on Courtney Hicks' 3f-3lo:	5   1   0   -1   -1   3   2		uh?
RT @cd_hooks: be honest there are at max 10 people who can testify to your character from high school and a couple of them  probably aren‚Äôt‚Ä¶
105 for that mess feels...pretty good, actually.
@SamantHarrin I didn't notice that but it could have been that I wasn't paying enough attention tbh
@SamantHarrin she seems very off axis.
come on gabby pull it together please
@cali_pygian Yeah, I'm trying to balance my personal discomfort - which is sort of irrelevant - with her approach. Like, she's clearly enjoys having this much sexuality injected into a program, so that's awesome! But she's also a baby? I don't know.
This program is great until you remember that Eunsoo is 15. I guess if she's comfortable with it - and she clearly is - then it's fine?
RT @rockerskating: Raf has to be so exasperated with Roxie by now. #USIntlClassic18
I'm here for ALL of your tweets imagining Raf being sick of this.
WE DO https://t.co/b33nMxvvGC
RT @DadeMeghan: Lol raf was probably like ‚ÄúRoxy three years in a row ffff‚Äù
RT @SamantHarrin: hahaha how tired of this song is raf
@feelingamazing I almost wrote "yeah I said it" after writing male or female but I figured you'd all know.
Of course, some skaters get robbed nationally and rewarded internationally, but that's a topic for another day.		Or every day.		Which is when I think about it.		All the time. https://t.co/9qhXbHt0RC
She's still the most underscored skater, male or female, in international competition, and it's not even close.
oh no this is not what i ordered
oops
Tammy looks SO DISPLEASED with that score oh my goodness üòÇ
I need more programs to underrated Florence songs please and thank you!!!!!!!!!
I LOVE EVERYTHING ABOUT THIS AND SHE'S KILLING IT.
OH MY GOD I AM SO ON BOARD WITH THIS
lol whoops https://t.co/NyhraVRXgT
I LOVE GABBY'S DRESS
@team_pdd obviously.
@DadeMeghan @Em_Wilmes There have been a number of those in this competition... oops
@team_pdd HERO
I'm going to add this cover to the playlist I use to pump me up when I'm doing work...
Also please try a dress that doesn't look like a slip thx
Her arms going into jumps are really quite awful.
At least she's flinging her arms to the big accents?
As I mentioned last night, people who train in altitude are going to have an advantage here. Vincent won the free. Courtney should be able to survive this about as well as she normally does (whatever that means, I do not know).
1. Akari is my favorite ever.	2. She needs several more years in junior and maybe someone to help her work out those lutz/flip edge issues.	3. I LOVE HER SO MUCH.
Yay Yuna Shiraiwa was wonderful!!!
Phillip Mills Samson and Delilah. I have a lot of feelings about some of this choreo.
@feelingamazing üòÜ
Ooh, this is a good one. -3 and +3! for Misato and Tim! https://t.co/QoeACni3Sw
@DadeMeghan Incredibly so. What a disappointment.
Well that was about 17 million times better than the short dances so...fix your pattern dances, kids.
@JoyofEmily What a disappointment.
@SamantHarrin I LOVED their FD last year - LOVED IT. It was perfect for them, they performed it so well (except when they didn't but üíÅ), it really emphasized their strengths. This...does not.
Madi and Zach are SO. TALENTED and I truly, truly love their skating. But their programs are so hit or miss that it hurts. Everything's either perfect or really bad.
Just another year when Madi and Zach take their incredible talent and drive for success and apply it to extremely mediocre material.
The other junior-forever dance teams are in such deep shit. (And I say this as a HUGE Parsons fan, but their free skate is...questionable. at best.)

@tripletoes there's like 30 seconds in the middle that i swore was on the nature of daylight haha, maybe it was just heavily inspired :)
Christina and Anthony are FABULOUS
if it's not it sounds like him
MAX RICHTER??????
How many lift deductions is this team going to get?
@taraflutzinski I don't have the followers you do :P
He just lifted his head above hers rather than kiss her in case anyone was wondering how THAT'S going.
Things that are dance elements now that I can already recognize after watching a grand total of four FDs this season:	-sliding on the ice. on both knees. at the same time.	-a choreo sequence from the opposite wall to the judges' wall.
@qiutians NEVER HEARD OF IT
