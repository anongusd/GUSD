Long wait times are a symptom of socialized medicine. That's what's being pointed out here. Rand is paying, not tax dollars. No wait times.
I actually agree with her drawn-out point. Our representatives should be carrying out our will, not what will help create wealth for large businesses. https://t.co/biQSRgXy9f
@MangoMenace45 @realannapaulina @RandPaul @courierjournal She's speaking facts on socialized medicine. What you're referring has nothing to do with socialized medicine. A general surgeon in Canada is known for his work hernia repair, so Paul is making the personal choice to utilize and pay for his services.
@MangoMenace45 @realannapaulina @RandPaul @courierjournal Oh, man, how hard is it to be so ignorant? He's traveling to one of the best places for his condition, and he's paying out of pocket, not taking advantage of socialize medicine. I'm sure if he needed heart surgery or was diagnosed with cancer, he would stay right here.
I suppose the Mike Brown angle didn't work as well as he had hoped, so he appealed to Tamir Rice. Don't get me wrong, what happened to Tamir Rice was unfortunate, but these reactions don't manifest out of nowhere. For example, https://t.co/GRyNfleBzw	https://t.co/ROv4gdiPCe
Let's correct something in his asinine piece. It was during the March for Life, not the Indigenous People’s March. One march was a first time deal, and the other was putting on its 45th annual event. Little things like this make a big difference in reporting.

@Paladino4Senate @DeadgirlWendi @AdamCBivins @Lanieygr @RobLowe Not at all. Democrats continue to provide hills. Blackface, failing at basic math, cheering for infanticide, anti-Semitism. Oh, the list goes on and on. Despite what the left may believe, there are enough of us to wage war on every peak and in every valley.
@Jimmythehat1 @RobLowe @Alyssa_Milano What in the actual f*** are you talking about? "Repeat offender racist"? Today on Butthurt SJW Justice, Judge Jimmy weighs in. Perhaps the intent was to highlight a career of fraud by @SenWarren. There is evidence that she claimed Native American heritage to advance her career.
@DavidDTSS Toeing that line, eh? Multiple videos that have been released on their entirety. No one surrounded anyone. They didn't put their hands on anyone. The only people being remotely racist were the black Hebrew Israelites. Yet here you are appealing to race hahaha. Blinders on.
@alttext @DLoesch How is she an awful human, Ben? What has she done to hurt society? I consider Hitler, Mussolini, Mao to be awful humans, so we're likely worlds apart on the prerequisites. What has Mrs. Loesch done to make her such an awful human in your mind?
@ZachPincus @DLoesch Zach, who hurt you, man?
Something that stood out to me in the first episode of #TriggerWarning with @KillerMike. He said he was only using products made by blacks, but I couldn't help noticing the Nikes on his feet and remembering it was two white men who created Nike.
"Sometimes you've got to do the wrong thing for the right reasons." This is what Killer Mike said when justifying rigging an election in the infancy of his "country." Not a good start haha.
"New Africa" using a form of government created by whites from the west?! Holy shit! I think I'm going to live tweet this show from start to finish. There is so much hypocrisy, so much nonsense to pick apart.
So this Mario dude wants to be an individual in what is supposed to be a nation to celebrate diversity and individualism, yet everyone wants him to assimilate to New Africa's ways of doing things. Hmmm.... almost as if assimilation is important for a nation.
@KillerMike needed ID for admittance into "New Africa." Oh, okay haha. So much hypocrisy in this one. Especially dude catching heat for not wanting to pledge allegiance to some fake new country. Isn't this exactly what people are complaining about?
These are children breaking into cars and stealing guns, stealing the entire car, robbing people, and murdering people. Do they not have parents? Absolutely disgraceful. 		https://t.co/grouu6c20o
@Amuoralzg Shocking.
Man, we really need to discuss the new Netflix show "Trigger Warning with Killer Mike." 		Ironically, this show was suggested after watching "Alt-Right: Age of Rage," in which they vilified white people espousing the same rhetoric.		So much cringe and hypocrisy.
@Amuoralzg @DarrellRobers10 @SenGillibrand Oh, you think louder extreme voices means they're winning? Also, yes, they didn't know whether to stand or sit during the SOTU. Some sat over the socialist comment, but a lot stood up. Some sat over border security talking, some stood. Is it adding up yet?

@thekage75 Besides, who cares about allies? What have they done for America? We pump billions of billions of dollars into their economies through trade and directly through foreign aid. They need us a lot more than we need them. That's why they started paying their fair share.
@thekage75 80% of American taxpayers kept more money after Trump and his administration's tax cuts. How are billionaires the only ones benefitting?
@thekage75 1) What's worse now than it was under Obama? 	2) If Trump has angered our allies and trading partners, why are they still playing along? Why did Mexico and Canada sign the USMCA? Why are more European countries contributing to the UN than ever before? 	Sit down, parrot.
@thekage75 Because the United States, on my fronts, is doing better than it has in the past few decades. That's why you're retarded and your statement is nonsensical. I admire how you attempt to mask your own stupidity by attempting to insult my intelligence. You're still stupid.
@Amuoralzg @DarrellRobers10 @SenGillibrand Sad that I have to be specific about which socialist I'm referring to in the United States Federal Government.... I'm referring to the mindless nitwit known as AOC.

RT @RealJamesWoods: I’m gone a week and @LindseyGrahamSC actually IS Spartacus.
@37pacifists Ford herself said there were only 5 or 6 people at the party. How many of those were interviewed? How many of them denied being there or even seeing Kavanaugh there? Her own witnesses cannot even corroborate her accusations.
@CheriJacobus Which one of the 6 or 7 investigations did anyone prevent from taking place again? Oh, was Bill Clinton a Republican? Al Franken? John Conyers Jr? David Wu? Anthony Weiner? Eric Massa? John Edwards? Tim Mahoney? Gary Condit? Mel Reynolds? Charles Robb?
@outragedmother1 Non-women? Do you mean men?

@MichaelAvenatti @SenatorCollins A woman who came forward as a sexual assault victim... with zero evidence, clear details, and witnesses that denied knowledge her claims. Even the crappiest attorney would know her allegations wouldn't lead to anything but delays. Easiest check you've ever earned, huh?
@Harlan She looks white to me. #CulturalAppropriation
@themindfulspy @SenFeinstein Only women who don't toe their political agenda are incapable of thinking for themselves. Duh, @rezich. When the woman agrees with their warped ideologies, she's a strong, independent woman.

@CNN Great timing, CNN. Gotta hand it to u. U rly know how to appeal to the "oppressed" group that's currently up in arms. If Kavanaugh would had been accused of wearing black face 42 yrs ago, I'm sure u would have reported how 1 of Trump's policies are negatively affecting blacks.

@MichaelAvenatti You're not doing anything, dude. You're only relevant because the puppets (Dems and millennials) were told to hate Trump, and they love anyone who toes their political line. You're subpar and grimy.
@theblaze That woman is by far the most biggest imbecile I have ever heard speak.

But that toxic masculinity. But it's ok for men to cry. 		I swear, Democrats have no ethical standards whatsoever.

@jeneps Here we are a month later... Democrats sit on rape allegations for twenty days, and then release them when their prior attempts to delay a SCOTUS confirmation hearing failed. What's that Alanis Morissette song? Isn't it ironic...
@pattonoswalt Much like dogs, it's always the tiny ones who piss when you touch them that bark the loudest. Go back to doing your third-rate films and comedically dry stand-up.
@jeffzeleny Even after her testimony, her claims are still unsubstantiated. Witnesses that she claimed were at this SMALL gathering (her words) denied even being there. She has zero evidence and her witnesses don't even corroborate her story. Open and shut. Nice try, but #ConfirmKavanaugh
@LindseyGrahamSC has said exactly what every fair American was thinking. Man, his speech is all over social media. I've seen his part of the hearing at least 40 times in the past two hours. I get chills every single time I hear it.

@SenFeinstein As have numerous Democratic SCOTUS nominees. Those with their unwavering bias may not be willing to acknowledge that, but it's a fact. You all seem to say a load of nonsense to get elected into your positions and then take your own course.
