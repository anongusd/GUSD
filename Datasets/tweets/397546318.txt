@letclaybeclay @djrothkopf The contemporary GOP's other great trick has been turning voters against their own government and somehow trusting the private sector's beneficent "job creators." E.g. stirring suspicions about government coming between you and your doctor, when that's exactly what insurers do.
Feel like viewing hush money payments in isolation as an election law violation misses the point. @realDonaldTrump defrauded the electorate, basing his campaign on multiple false pretenses. Not just hiding his affairs but also Moscow tower project &amp; encouraging Russia email theft

@Scr00wed Certainly some are doing that. Not enough to be noticeable though, yes? No reports of major shifts in party ID.
And yet. One of the most important barometers isn't budging. I've always thought a dip in Trump's GOP approval below 75% would shake things loose. But as he sheds swing voters, approval in his own party remains stratospheric.
Each day it becomes clearer that @realDonaldTrump is trying to conduct a presidency entirely through schtick--something usually subject to its own laws of gravity.

@eclecticbrotha I need to emulate your nonchalance. Instead my advocate's reflex propels me into argument
@feloneouscat @tfrogdotcom @eclecticbrotha Paraphrasing Keynes, in the long term the uninsured are all dead. That was a bit harsh, but politics is a battle fought in the near-term, and you see the heart of my argument: that the build-on-ACA approach has better chance of getting more uninsured covered sooner.
@MaryRosePoint Thanks Mary!
Due to my concerns about feeding unrealistic--and potentially self-defeating--ambitions and expectations, I will not be running for president.
@Rose_Redrum Yes
@eclecticbrotha I guess I have to take my turn defending pragmatism against the purists
Also also me:  I'm worried about that thing of candidates  peaking too early
@eclecticbrotha what have you gotten me into  ; )
@pauldrisley Your old boss had one of the biggest vetoes on any reform scheme. Like I  say, our fellow industrialized nations with single payer have political cultures to go with it.
@pauldrisley Paul, I don't favor it. My point is that ACA bears lessons in how long it took to achieve and in how it's based on the status quo rather than going back to the drawing board
@feloneouscat @tfrogdotcom @eclecticbrotha 1. Pressing states like mine for ACA Medicaid expansion 		2. Lowering Medicare age 1/2 yr at a time		3. Raising income maximum for Medicaid eligibility 		4. Increasing subsidies on individual exchanges 		Like I say, I'm about extending coverage to the uninsured million by million
@feloneouscat @tfrogdotcom @eclecticbrotha First off, not sure those of us who worked our asses off for Obama and consider ACA his / our greatest achievement are open to charges of giving up.		Any way, here's what I'd be doing while folks are demanding single-payer...
Since I've gone straight into this thicket again, here's the thread from the last time I did nearly a year ago 👇	https://t.co/aIjfiLzzOe
Again, I'm not here to tout the virtues of our healthcare system. Color me skeptical, though, of a universal healthcare strategy that simply wishes away the reality of this employer-based system that's had 75 years to sink its roots in.
@tfrogdotcom @eclecticbrotha Saying "can" without serious consideration of the obstacles is not a first step to anything
I'm not debating that single payer is workable or preferable, clearly it is. I just don't like talking about things that are desirable w/o a realistic idea how to get there. 		Linking health insurance to employers 75 years ago wasn't best way to go. Also not so easy to walk back
If I recall correctly, the ACA was a massive political lift. There's a reason we went 45 years between extensions of the medical safety net.		The helpful thing for UK, Canadian or Danish, etc single-payer systems is Danish and Canadian voters &amp; political cultures.
RT @holborne: @David_Shorr Good thing he doesn’t have a vagina or he’d probably be shoving a jade egg up it
@tfrogdotcom @eclecticbrotha No, there are millions more uninsured needing health coverage. I'm just not sure we should pretend we're starting from scratch -- or that trying to get rid of private insurance is the best path to reduce those numbers of uninsured.

Then there's the thing about "destroying America." Where does this leave us a nation of immigrants?		In conclusion, Glenn Grothman has to pick his white privilege poison. Either the children of the not-best don't stand a chance of making it in America or they can "bootstraps!" 6/
...of "pulling yourself up by your bootstraps." So Rep. Grothman, if the children of the not-best are fated to be not-best, where does this leave the conservative idea of equal opportunity rather than equal outcomes? 5/
Wait, there's more ugliness in Grothman's statement. It is a core premise of our civic code that children should have a chance to succeed--that their fates aren't determined at birth. It's one of the reasons for public schools and also crucial for the conservative idea... 4/
So many problems with Rep. Grothman's idea of the bad--er, not-the-best--children of not-best people. Since Grothman is talking about brown not-best immigrants, his prejudging of their not-best children sound a lot like racial biology. 3/
At least he says this in code, and I'm betting he'd try to hide behind the idea that there are "better people." Though we're left to wonder how he knows which is which. 		Rep. Grothman's prejudice against the children of immigrants is explicit and inexcusable. 2/

In the after work hours we had a steady stream of sane-day registering students at the District 2 polling place. We actually ran out of forms and had to get more https://t.co/XOGe0H1r7C
@AaronMesh @HalpernAlex Fun fact: PDX has an incredibly small Council (five, I think) and members all have cabinet appointments responsible for leading city departments
Evers def still in it
@Kristennel @robertmentzer Hang tight. Just takes them as long as it takes.
@robertmentzer Yeah, I think I've already been enough of a pain at our polling place, dealing with a shortage of registration forms
@robertmentzer But seriously, my guess is that heavy turnout meant having to wait till the end to process large #s of absentee ballots
@robertmentzer In the 2016 spring elections I had to wait till after midnight for the results of my own race.
@robertmentzer Want me to drive down there right now?
@robertmentzer Yep. And massive turnout tonight.
Your leadership has been an inspiration and a sight to behold. https://t.co/yASgs4iD1O

Someone please explain to the pundits that guaranteed coverage for preexisting conditions is already in place -- thanks to something called the Affordable Care Act that Democrats passed almost a decade ago.

@sbg1 Yep
So proud of our Stevens Point community for a turnout apparently of about three-quarters of registered voters.
My campus source told me the students were impressively well informed about the issues, including the referend-a / -ums.		At our polling place we definitely saw them turn out in droves.

Meanwhile state GOP attorneys general are pressing a lawsuit to get rid of the requirement for insurers to cover preexisting conditions, and the Senate majority today opposed @SenatorBaldwin's bill to keep it in place.

And that is how the media's #BothSides bias helps Republicans enormously. Example #156,433
The core premise of the GOP approach is to insulate the healthcare / health 'haves' from the 'have-nots.' The minute you start doing that, you can't cover those with health needs. #AdverseSelection
All of the pieces of the #ACA are inextricably bound in order to enlarge the health insurance risk pool -- the only way to expand coverage and rein in premiums.
Just when GOP mendacity on healthcare was finally starting to catch up with them, the lazy media throws them a lifeline. If reporters and editors would dig just a tiny bit, they'd see an objective reality where GOP promises are totally at odds with their actions.

Dr. Blasey Ford was denied justice but performed a valuable service in exposing corruption. The world could see the Judiciary Republicans undermined her while claiming and pretending to respect her. We could see how little they've learned about sexual violence and patriarchy 5/x
And so the individual human trauma is compounded by a societal failure. Dr. Blasey Ford did her civic duty, and the perverse effect was to expose corruption in the government she turned to. She did her duty, and the Judiciary Cmte was derilect in theirs. 4/x
Dr. Ford did her civic duty and then some. She did so with awe-inspiring grace and composure. As Americans we owe her tremendous thanks, and the Judiciary Cmte owed her the respect of trying to corroborate her account--not dissembling about the supposed lack of corroboration 3/x
At a human level, what Dr. Blasey Ford went through--utterly alone--36 yrs ago was unimaginable and horrifying at a human level. But at a societal level, what's happening this week is a failure of our system of self-government and a shocking dereliction by the party in power. 2/x
Unsettling as it was to listen to Dr. Blasey Ford recount her trauma yesterday, it is even more upsetting today to see elected representatives in the Senate majority respond with the naked assertion of power and staggeringly skewed judgment of credibility. 1/x

He's breaching decorum of basic respect for the Democrats as US senators all over the place. The fundamental rule of humility in the face of advice and consent is out the window.
Every damn thing the Republicans are saying about corroboration is eviscerated by their refusal to let the FBI investigate
When I was 16 or 17, it really impressed me that someone got into Yale. At this point, I don't give a fuck.
If nothing else, Judge Kavanaugh knows the rules: the senators pose the questions to the nominee. Never the other way around. #DoYouLikeBeer
More than anything, I'm struck that Kavanaugh thinks his denial and credibility are the end of the story. Far from wanting to objectively get to the bottom of the matter, he wants us to take his word because he's an accomplished member of the elite.
It is now clearly established that Kavanaugh is resistant to an FBI investigation.

Part of me is surprised Kavanaugh didn't try saying "I didn't even know the facts of life until I was 25."
Am I the only one who noticed Kavanaugh saying he never even met Blasey Ford?
We're not talking enough about how Kavanaugh hasn't earned credibility. He's been caught in clear lies and not come clean on any of them.

Shorter Trump #UNGA lunch toast: So many great terrific things and people.
@shebacrocker @kellymagsamen Broadly I understand the sentiment, but hard for me to go along with a categorical "no matter who it is." Diplomatic deference to an American president can be stretched to a breaking point. E.g. I can see the sentiment more applicable to GWB, whom I opposed, rather than DJT.
And Kavanaugh himself is playing a game that fits the political moment. He's trying to use our discomfort with calling out a liar and deference to the privileged elite -- counting on these things to shield him from scrutiny and accountability.
@gplevris @Martina He's done great damage, to be sure, but the laughter was clearly directed at him personally. The other world leaders have his number.
The president's #UNGA remarks literally didn't pass the laugh test.

@Shoq Still feel like we're disagreeing at the margins rather than on the heart of the matter. Hard for the sides to meet in the middle when one views the middle as somehow radically leftist. We're living with the wreckage of a systematic effort to delegitimize government in itself.

@pauldrisley And there absolutely is a problem with chair umpire consistency in the sport, though that's tennis' problem and can't be laid at Ramos' feet. 5/5
@pauldrisley But despite the fraught history of accusations against Serena -- which do make it a sensitive issue -- she knows the difference between "your coach just signaled at you" vs "you're a cheater." 4/
@pauldrisley Ramos absolutely exercised poor judgment and had other options. Where the critique of Ramos loses me is the certainty about his motives and dismissal of the substantive issues having to do with the rules. 3/
@pauldrisley As with any situation that's messy, I think the proper response is to spread the blame. I've seen tons of commentary claiming Serena or Ramos was entirely in the right, and I don't find those takes persuasive. To be sure, Ramos deserves the lion's share of blame--at least 75%. 2/
@robertmentzer I found some pretty ornery ones by pushing for redesign of a major street in town ; )
@pauldrisley Funny you mention. There has been joking at Serena's expense making me uneasy. Even though the jokes (overheard from the other foursome) weren't especially offensive, I can't help thinking of the context of race and gender. 1/

@katierosenberg My first post-college job was a few blocks from the Towers. Anyway, I wanted to reschedule my trip as soon as possible, and a couple things struck me on that visit two weeks later -- both having to do with other visitors.
@katierosenberg The attack was just over a year after I moved to the Midwest, and I remember feeling disoriented by being 1,000 miles away from the two places I'd spent most of my life till that point. That morning my flight en route to NYC was grounded, something our pilots had never seen.

Sudden outbreak of expertise on Twitter, but for tennis officiating
@rainmaker567 Again, by the book Ramos was within his rights to do what he did. But I'm in the camp saying he showed poor judgment--rather than egregious abuse--in failing to give an additional warning before assessing the game penalty.Don't agree w those who say he followed the obvious course
@rainmaker567 Serena is accustomed to beefing with the chair, and I think it's made her too slow to ask for the referee, which would've been appropriate for her to do earlier in this situation and  helped avoid escalation 3/
@rainmaker567 Now if she realizes the questions of fact and law are clear enough that the referee can't step in, is that an admission that she doesn't have a case? 2/
@rainmaker567 Okay, I dug out my copy of the Friend at Court rulebook and looked it up. The referee's there for rulings on the questions of law, not questions of fact. So that's what ties the referee's hands. 1/
@rgay He was also disqualified from the Australian Open for his antics, as was Fabio Fognini from last year's US Open for code violations
@SBalaghi To go further than saying an error in judgment and discretion and say it was an egregious abuse -- I'm afraid there's too much fact, law, and Ramos' own consistency on which he can stand.
@SBalaghi ...an official like Ramos -- and I'm a certified umpire who's worked at lower levels -- is caught between the duty not to insert himself into the match as well as duty to uphold the rules as well as his own authority (same as Marija Cicak or any gold badge umpire)...
@SBalaghi I definitely see the error in judgment as well as the social/racial/gender context and the history of the BS Serena's endured -- all of which I took stock of in my extended thread. But it's too neat and easy to tag Ramos with all of the latter. As Matt Z elaborates in his post...
#SmartTake Including key point that Ramos has a clear record as tough on code violations https://t.co/GclMKQ2EAO
@BigBrain1234 From what the USO statement says about chair ruling being "final and not reviewable," apparently there wasn't any way for the referee to overrule
@BigBrain1234 Certainly in some situations, but maybe its circumscribed in ways I'm forgetting. You'd certainly think he would've wanted to
Generally speaking referees should backup chair umpires, but this didn't seem like a situation to do that. Only thing I can think is that maybe the referee can overrule only when the chair is blatantly wrong about the facts or law of the situation. 14/14
Serena might've avoided the game penalty if she'd used her right of appeal to the referee instead of getting into it with the chair. Big mystery to me is why the referee didn't, even at that point, overturn the chair's decision. To me that would've made the most sense. 13/
Last point is about the role of the tournament referee. There's an established outlet for Serena to channel her frustration. She just should have been quicker to shift from arguing with the chair umpire to requesting the referee, who basically serves as a court of appeals. 12/
Really important thing, I think, is Ramos' record of enforcing code violations. If he has a history as a stickler for enforcement, it undercuts her grievance. If he has little history as an enforcer, it bolsters her case considerably. Haven't heard anything on this yet. 11/
Next: "Men get away with much worse." Important to compare apples to apples here. The men do pace around cursing, which also is a code violation. Less common, though, for them to direct those curses at the chair. Serena's language was mild, but she was insulting the chair. 10/
As a matter of exercising good judgment, I don't think chair umpire Ramos should have given the game penalty without an additional warning. Yet he did have a basis for giving the additional penalty. In other words, the rules do back him up, but it wasn't the wisest move. 9/
Before saying more about the words she had with the chair -- which prompted the game penalty -- Serena certainly knew the stakes automatically went up after being assessed a point penalty. Any player would be aware of the heightened jeopardy. 8/
But she did break a racket, which was a second code violation after the warning given for Patrick's coaching from the player's box. Hence the penalty of a point for Naomi. I can tell you every jr. player knows how to avoid being 'coded' for racket abuse--fling it at your bag 7/
Second unfortunate misunderstanding: Serena didn't get that the point penalty wasn't for coaching but for racket abuse. Ramos never accused here of cheating--which gave Serena the basis for saying afterward that the two were on the same page. 6/
Serena was justifiably confused about a couple things. One, she didn't really understand that Patrick Moratoglu was (as he confessed) coaching her through hand gestures. In fairness to Serena, she didn't look for it and didn't herself do it. Patrick did.  5/
So here we go. Key thing to know: 'code violations' are a certain category of misdeeds subject to the 'point penalty system.' That system gives a warning after 1st violation, awards the opponent a point after 2nd, and a game after 3rd. That's what Chair Umpire Ramos was doing. 4/
It's not obvious, though, that today's events can neatly be categorized as yet another instance of Serena-hating. Also should say that whatever the Qs about the controversy, everything she did and said after the match was impeccably classy. 3/
Undeniably Serena has dealt with a lot of sexist and racist shit. You can google Serena &amp; Indian Wells for one famous example (personally I was thrilled to be there for the match when she returned). And count me a Tennys Sandgren hater for the shit he's said. At same time... 2/
Now that I've analyzed what happened with Serena -- from one lowly umpire's perspective -- in an email for my mom, I might as well share it with you all. 1/
Ramos' officiating record also seems pertinent. If he doesn't have a history of enforcing code violations, that certainly would bolster her case.
@rainmaker567 He is the court of appeals, so I thought he could overrule. Maybe he can only do so on the basis of a point of fact or law being clearly wrong. Lemme see what I can find on this
Can't help looking at the #USOpen debacle from the vantage of my umpire's training. To me, most pieces here have valid arguments on either side. But the real headscratcher was the referee backing up the chair umpire. Seems obvious the referee should've reversed the game penalty

But we'll have an empirical test of the state of Strzok's professional reputation relative to Flynn's: in his post-government career, will Strzok be chasing any of the same kind of weird bottom-tier clients as Flynn? 3/3
From all indications, it looks like Strzok was well suited and effective as head of counterintelligence, whereas Flynn was pushed out of DIA because of serious issues with his leadership. 2/3

Know how I feel about a $12 or $15 minimum wage? I think it'd be great after we get a $9 or $10 minimum. Exactly why is the burden of proof on Dems anyway? Can we talk about how the GOP has so stubbornly blocked an FMW increase that the 9 yrs since the last is 2nd longest ever?
I think it's a problem to make promises you can't keep. If we already have a problem of disaffection--which I can make a strong case is undeserved and belied by the Obama record--then a shoot-the-moon agenda just sets us up for more disaffection
The left's failure to credit the Obama record is one side of the coin, where shoot-for-the moon unrealistic ambition is the other.
It's one thing for Rs to distort Obamacare beyond recognition. They reached a point of needing to deny its success as a matter of political survival. For progressives to downplay--if not belittle--the extension of health coverage to tens of millions of Americans is confounding.
Not for nothing that the left-wing critique of Dems coincides with #BothSides that obscures the far-right lurch of the other party and gave Jill Stein voters an alibi.

Brief seriousness interlude in this sarcastic thread. Civility is an important virtue, but it must be predicated--and contingent--on goodwill, intellectual honesty, and good faith. When those are absent, then shame, ridicule, and sarcasm are not only appropriate but imperative.
As we all know, politics is the struggle for civility. It determines the balance of civility and which party gets to be in civility.

This protest blocking the bus of migrants is so appropriate and on-point! Just like the airlines resisting being complicit, it puts focus on this very opaque process of moving migrants around. Americans have justified Qs about kids being moved farther &amp; farther from their parents
@mccaffreyr3 But in all sincerity, as frustrated as I get with #BothSides -- and it does drive me batty -- I do appreciate your willingness to engage in back-and-forth.
@mccaffreyr3 An inclusive risk pool is essence of the problem, and the reason that the individual mandate was at the heart of the grand bargain w/ the insurance industry. The thrust of the opposition to ACA is to let healthy people opt out or buy junk insurance,just how a death spiral happens
@mccaffreyr3 When the other party shows this kind of relentless mendacity -- enabled by political media coverage and commentary bending over backwards to give #BothSides -- it makes for an unfair political playing field. Of which your own tweet is symptomatic
@mccaffreyr3 Not for nothing that it took until 2017, when the real Obamacare -- as opposed to the GOP punching bag -- became better understood for Ocare to become popular and Republicans find it impossible to replace. Just as Nancy Pelosi predicted.
@mccaffreyr3 For the past 10 yrs, Dems' top priority has been to extend health care to millions of Americans who lack it. After succeeding for the 1st time in 45 yrs, we were rewarded w/ so much relentless distortion of Obamacare that somehow this historic achievement was treated as a scandal
"Have they no decency?" is a self-answering question.
Reminder: NOTHING about immigration law, the politics of immigration, or the legislative debate in Congress -- NONE of that bears any logical connection to Trump's decision to take children away from their parents.

@lisang @Laurie_Garrett @WhiteHouse I guess the piece to be most scared about would be the potential budget cuts and reductions in workforce at the agencies, where Tillerson's carnage at DoS was scary enough
@lisang @Laurie_Garrett @WhiteHouse So that's a simple non-lawyer's reminder that reorganizing the federal government can't be done by fiat. And of course other pieces also entail changing authorities and statutes. Again, the basic Q is how we politically assess congressional GOP majority's ability to legislate
@lisang @Laurie_Garrett @WhiteHouse My pt is key but pretty simple. Federal agencies are creatures of Congress so that reorgs--from creating a new agency (like DHS under Bush) to a new subcabinet assistant secretary / bureau--is a statutory matter. So answer to your Q really is a matter of legislative handicapping
@lisang @Laurie_Garrett @WhiteHouse Seems like the major pieces would require legislation, so you can peg your worry-level for those pieces to your sense of their ability to get them through Congress
I think we need to be clear about this. Among Trump's seemingly endless series of outrages, seizing children from their parents stands apart.
Summarily -- possibly permanently -- removing children from their parents' custody as summary punishment for a misdemeanor is the worst abuse by the US government has committed within our borders in the last half-century.
The lack of a system to track kids and parents should be filed under 'Further Proof We Didn't Need" for the wanton cruelty of Trump's child-seizing policy. Trump-Sessions-Nielsen-Miller were oblivious to the abuse of fundamental rights they were committing, or its consequences
@GaryLegum In fact, it places a legal onus on the US government.

@Zathras3 Not what I see in this situation. Rather, multiple threads such as detention conditions, border operations, immigration processing, human interest in the parents &amp; kids, and Capitol Hill drama--with Republicans forcing attention toward latter. They're losing the main thread
@shebacrocker The more I think about the airlines' handling of this, the more I'm struck by how appropriate and important it is. Even if the hour's pretty late by now
@Zathras3 The media's capacity to handle stimulus overload is being tested by this history-in-the-making episode. And by tested, I of course mean shown lacking.
The only conclusion we can reach about what Trump, Sessions, Nielsen, and Miller have done to these fellow humans is that they don't view them as families--or even as humans.
The real story of the difficulty of reuniting families isn't about chaos, incompetence, processing, lawmaking or even heartache of separation. What matters more than anything is that top US officials abused parents' &amp; children's basic rights without any regard or responsibility
Dear media,	If you aren't hammering the central point that the POTUS and atty general ordered children taken from their parents, you're doing it wrong. The US govt not only summarily took custody of people's children, the abuse was compounded by not even recording &amp; tracking them
OTOH this is our government summarily taking over custody these kids without even setting up a way to return them to their parents -- without taking that basic responsibility for their actions https://t.co/0va6f1HG4v

Our government is summarily making thousands of children wards of the state with such an abruptness, callousness, carelessness, and arrogant exercise of power, there's only one explanation: they don't view these kids and parents as families -- or as human beings.

Embarrassed as I feel about having this abomination done in our name by our very own government, obviously that feeling of shame is nothing compared with the suffering of those parents and kids. Never thought I'd see the day #TrumpInternmentCamps
@SteveSchmidtSES As a Democrat, I want to say how incredibly eloquent I've found your commentary in these troubled times. Thank you
Bad as the last 16 months have been, we're in new territory here. Territory where it's appropriate--necessary, even--to use words that should normally be used with caution.
The only plausible explanation is that Trump, Sessions, Miller, and Nielsen don't actually view them as families--or as humans, for that matter.

About this whole thing of children-as-bargaining-leverage. If congressional Rs claim to oppose family separation, Dems shouldn't have to give one damn thing. Shouldn't be any bargaining or any need for Dems to prove their sincerity by yielding to some odious GOP hobbyhorse.

@julian_strachan @shadihamid @lexiconstable @patrickdehahn One request: please confine 'impact' to use as a noun. As a verb, it just doesn't offer any shade of meaning  to serve an alternative to 'affect' 		And can 'learning' and 'convening' just be gerunds without morphing into nouns? Or is that horse out of the barn?
@julian_strachan @shadihamid @lexiconstable @patrickdehahn OTOH, I like 'they-them' as a replacement for s/he. I've switched to it particularly when trying to preserve confidentiality and mask an anonymous source
@julian_strachan @shadihamid @lexiconstable @patrickdehahn Plus there's the generational dimension. My 1983 senior thesis used 'she' as the generic pronoun. Took till very recently for me to come around to idea of gender fluidity and still think they-them is overused for that purpose.

@mattyglesias I remember trying to read Mary Poppins to my daughter, and it was impossible. A.A. Milne I could just manage.
@Zathras3 @sethdmichaels @nytimes Sure, when it comes to a given problem or another. But here the issue is broader. I'm not talking about the media carrying water on particular issues. My point is about a prevalent approach to the entire category of 'politics' and the applicable standards and expectations
Fair question and worth pondering. Even so, I wonder how much the Washington media discussion may ripple outward to make an impression even on those who don't pay close attention to it. https://t.co/myeINHUilV
Seems weird for the referees of politics in the media to be consciously lowering the bar this way. So much of what's peddled as political analysis is so amoral and cynical we should question it's value. As Seth says, this cynicism is to some degree self-fulfilling. 4/4
And if you too notice this pattern of media discussion that treats politics as an amoral realm where it's all about what you can get away with and pulling one over on the electorate, then let's press the question why that's an okay view of the nature of politics? 3/
Try something when you watch cable news. Whenever you hear anchors, reporters, or pundits talking about political implications--"what does this mean politically?"--check whether that part of the discussion sets aside facts, legality, truthfulness, or other basic norms.  2/
Speaking of which, we need to talk about the media's weird compulsive use of the word 'politically' -- which is a big part of what Seth calls "performed cynicism." 1/ https://t.co/UuPpzKZluF
