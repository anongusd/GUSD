If you're just tuning into Twitter, there's a reason you're see Manny Machado trending.
If Manny Machado wasn't going to sign with the Yankees, I'm glad he went to the other league. If he stayed in the American League, Machado probably would have hit .900 against the Yankees.

I loved @RollingStones at #SuperBowl in 2007 but you told me I was wrong to think like that.
Heard this joke about a couple that gets to a baseball game in the bottom of the 5th and the score is 0-0 and one says "see we didn't miss much." Turning on #SuperBowl and hearing it's 3-0 in the 3rd I can say "see I didn't miss much."

Maybe when the newest member of the New York Yankees, DJ LeMahieu, hits a home run, John Sterling will use his Giancarlo Stanton home run call and say  "DJ, non si può stopparlo!" in French. https://t.co/d7ArPqwQy7

I've been following the New York Yankees since 1972. Based on expectations and results (so far) this has been one of their most boring post-seasons.
