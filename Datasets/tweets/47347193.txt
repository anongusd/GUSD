@KathyBurke I quoted you on the telly about Keith Flint. You summed him up perfectly. Brilliant.
@brianmoore666 Ugh. I don’t know what to do. I really didn’t like you as a player (I’m Scottish) I’ve grown to love you as a commentator. But now this... do I go back?
@PeterDGPHunt @louisehead18 Tough break Peter. Hard to go deep undercover once you’ve been on the telly anyway, I’d have thought.
@PeterDGPHunt Don’t it make you glad you left all that behind.
@MartinBashir Nice one granddad :)
@CSchpoliansky Thanks Christophe! (Even though I know you mean Claude and not me) Was a great night!
Not working this year... just going for fun. Kids didn’t recognize us. https://t.co/73VJIDcBxE
@victoriaarbiter BTW, you were in my hometown the other day! Meant to reply to the pic from the train station. Hope it was sunny :)
@AJGuglielmi Hello, can you confirm ap report quoting you Smollett and lawyers meeting with police and prosecutors this afternoon? Thanks, Nick CNN
@sommervilletv Great interview with Begum. Really good questioning. I pulled over to listen.
@JeffRudeGolf Hi Jeff. I'm a reporter with CNN. Could you DM me an email address? Have a quick and basic question about a story you wrote a few years ago. Thanks, Nick
@DGoughie Never thought I’d get over the loss of TMS. I was wrong. You guys are doing a great job. Thanks a lot.
@euanmccolm This is the version I listen to most often to put a little fire in my belly. Don’t believe the ‘ype. https://t.co/46CuGB5MnP via @YouTube
@seaningle Should it be "Kirk Yetholm in the Scottish Borders"? Great story.
@chuckwacreek Too bad we missed the Kabob House. I love that stuff. But we got some pretty good bar food! Thanks for the direction :)
@ElysianGlenn @jaketapper @TheLeadCNN Stay safe! The whole thing sounds terrifying. And be well. Nick
@Starshadow Didn’t know I had a style... but I’m glad it’s growing on you :)
@philippesands I will pass it along. I’m way out west in LA, so I think Ratline should be a film. Rome 1949 an amazing time and place.
@philippesands I did use the ‘skip back 15 seconds button’ a couple of times. What a fantastic podcast. Makes commuting a pleasure.
@BrickMaster2 No, that ship has sailed. Was kind of fun while it lasted.
@MartinWawrusch Hi, I found a box of contact lenses addressed to you in my garden trash in Santa Monica. You want them?
@EvanHD @BBCPM I feared he was irreplacable. But I hadn’t thought of you. You will be fantastic. Congratulations.
@arobertwebb @sambaintv @jessearmstrong1 The greatest show ever made. Thank you very much. I still rewatch. Seen every episode maybe a dozen times. Just brilliant in every way.
@robdelaney You are a wonderful human being. In your comedy and everything else, you say what most of us can’t or won’t say. I think about you, Henry, and the rest of your family a lot.
@GailHoneyman Thank you for writing such a beautiful book. Made me laugh and cry as I sat waiting for a hurricane in South Carolina. Might just be the best book I've ever read. Cheers.
@PVMayorCollins @ParadiseVallAZ Thanks Michael. Your town is very nice!
@brycetache Hi Bryce, I'm a reporter with CNN. Interested in speaking to this lady. Could you DM me? Thanks, Nick.
@samknightwrites Beautifully written. Wow. Looking forward to more of your work.
@PhillySuperstar It's how I act in real life too. Waving a notebook and shouting loudly at anyone who'll listen.
@KRISten_JA @CNN Thanks! I was on vacay... but been doing wildfires all week. You need to watch more CNN :)
RT @olivia8k: @elongreen @nickwattcnn wow!
@ScottRogowsky @kayleno04 I am friends with Scott Rogowsky. It’s not all that it’s cracked up to be.
@YuiMok I was also wondering... beautiful! Well done. Nailed it.
@spencerchen @mslinnmag Cheers Spencer!
@spencerchen @mslinnmag I wore the same tie to your wedding. And you let me in the chapel.
@chachaspillane Thanks Michelle. Glad you’re enjoying it!
@victoriaarbiter And I agree with abolautely everything you say :)
@SamoJeff Go back to bed Jeff.
@SuzzRocks777 Thanks Suzzanne. Xani was great. Good luck to you and all the others struggling after this attack. All the best. Nick
@mnoble5 Fluffy on the surface, existential underneath. One of my favorites.
@booveboy Responding to a report of someone breaking windows in the area.
@DBtodomundo @BBCRadio4 Was a fantastic listen. I’ve loved your music for years. Had no idea you were born in Dumbarton. Now love it even more!
@Herring1967 Do your Scottish accept there and I’ll give you a fiver. Meanwhile I’m listening to you and Jess Phillips. Nae bad.
@TwitSister1 Thanks!
@PeeWeeWinston I did! Couple of weeks ago.
@TOTENewsFlash Interesting. Thank you for the info. Stay safe.
@romanov_76_110 Thanks Sam. I'll miss my occasional jaunts on WNN. Jeanne Moos? Well, I'll just have to figure it out. Not exactly sure what I'll become and that's part of the fun.
@jaketapper @CNNPR @jeffzeleny @abcnews @CNN Thanks Jake!
@BillWeirCNN Thanks Bill :)
@mattcharris @BillWeirCNN It's called an eating station, Matt. Seriously.
@FrePups Wow, you dug deep for that :)
@Martina Just listened to your old Desert Island Discs. Was always a fan, but now more than ever. Supreme intelligence, insight and honesty. Wonderful to hear.
@romanov_76_110 Thanks. It was a frankly magical experience!
@PaddingtonMovie @simonfarnaby What a brilliant film. Thank you! Applause at the end in the LA cinema where we watched. Made my day.
@jdcor711 Thanks Dan. Much appreciated :)
@jennykleeman What a beautiful story. Thank you.
@romanov_76_110 @kendisgibson @dianermacedo No plans in place, Sam. Happy Holidays :)
@DaleEdgerton Love Actually and Where Eagles Dare. Every Christmas. No Winslet in Casa Watt.
@Themrsshaw88 How can you give Love Actually your full attention when you are also baking? I am very disappointed.
@Teacherk81 Ha. You're a stickler! Nothing wrong with that. Sometimes I forget my school days when I'm talking nonsense at 4am...
@romanov_76_110 Yea, I am so typecast :)
@SamoJeff Debbie Downer. That's me.
@adamlivingst0n3 @BBCNewsnight Yea, I don't think I do...
@BBCNewsnight Of course he hasn't actually been in office for a year.
@SimonAmstell Is Carnage getting an American airing/streaming sometime? I'm recommending it to people who can't watch it. They're getting annoyed with me.
@Geodee_Dee :)
@Geodee_Dee @abcWNN And Vanna is one of the nicest I've met :)
@brentashcroft @TheVannaWhite Thanks Brent. She's a lovely person.  A gem.
@AdamBuxton Are you doing anything else while in LA? Live podcast? Love your work. And, I mean, I like Bowie, but maybe don't love him enough for this?
@MizzyII Scottish...
@romanov_76_110 I like some harder news every now and again.
@TheRochaSays @griffinde That's terrible!
@BillWeirCNN Keep up the good work, Bill. Thoughts with you and the people whose stories you're telling.
@RealMattLucas I hear you
@RealMattLucas Grenfell doesn't sell papers. A bad example? Big issues with portions of the press. But I'm not sure blanket maligning is helpful.
@RealMattLucas Really? The press takes photos to get stories out. Otherwise, people die in a vacuum. Nothing changes. Much different.
@CalfMom I mean, in sure your cows are lovely. But I'm not one to face my fears :)
@sillygirljen082 Thanks... but I need to get back to LA, the beach, and my bed...
@DW5Trust @DoddieWeir5 @ronadougallnews @ScotlandTonight Always one of my favorite players. Now, what a man. Plenty living left to do.
@droidcam Lovely! Have a great trip.
@NancyPC24 :)
@RascoePattie Now I get it!
@romanov_76_110 No cow nightmares recently. I'll keep you informed. I'm here all week...
@sherryazellers :)
@sherryazellers Already did it. Jury is out :)
@RocGirlNY :)
@thomaStanleyh @ABC Dude, I stopped talking for at least 3 seconds. That's a big deal for me.
@DavidMuir mine are cooler. https://t.co/J48wigaNrz
@sherryazellers That might have just been my hair blowing in the wind.

@alstewitn @BBCNewsnight Wrong Nick Watt, Mr Stewart... you're not the first and won't be the last.
@Joe2CT @LinzieJanis @abcWNN Thanks Joe. Yea, I've been gone a while. Maybe lost some innate Brit tall poppy syndrome. Happy weekend.
@KrazyKoolCherry @abcWNN :)
@C_Joyce3183 @abcWNN Thanks very much. Must say, I do enjoy it.
@romanov_76_110 Thanks Sam.
@Joe2CT I don't think that's true. Personally, I love The Beatles. Interviewed McCartney a couple times. Life highlights. Ringo wasn't on my list :(
@mgard_wzzm13 Most people hate it. :)
@hiimmattpeaK @dianermacedo @abcWNN I do laugh with her! She's hilarious. I also sometimes faux outrage. Maybe that's your beef :)
@BASSGOLDY Thank you. You should. Nice place. But I would say that...
@danny_robins Yes. DM and I'll put you in touch. (PS this is Claudine Weinbrenn's husband)
@romanov_76_110 @LinzieJanis Ha. Not anytime soon. But I am back in the early morning in a couple of weeks...
@DenisMacShane Note that I am not the Nick Watt of Newsnight...
@bm_summer Boris... or Ruth Davidson? Can't be Rudd with that majority.
@bm_summer Fair enough. Mind-Bending night. Tory revival in Scotland! Vince in clegg out. No indyref2, flaccid Brexit? Boris PM of tory/dup coalition?
@bm_summer Go to bed. Rudd clung on...
@bensherwoodDATG Thanks boss :)
@guardian_sport "Hartley, the only one of the four home unions not in the 41..." Don't think there's a Scotland captain in the 41 either?
@CashDolla I think Monday night on Nightline. That's the plan.
@Gladwell Wow Revisionist History is really rather good. Thank you for my good times stuck in traffic.
@patmayo Actually Alec Baldwin was great! Funny as hell.
@BriHReed Just finished S-Town. Sat in my car in parking lot until ep VII was over. Exceptional work. Thank you.
@AdamTomasek @MeredithFrost My children enjoy it very much. Adventure suggestions always welcome!
@AdamTomasek @MeredithFrost Nice of you not to mention I fell down a hill. Hope you're well, Adam. That was a great trip.
@driverminnie Lovely plug. Precise time and everything. Arbiter? we'll take it. Thanks.
@Herring1967 Right up your strasse. Chinese man 'marries' robot he built himself https://t.co/eGH3JiDJx8
@butterwanker @AshleyRiegle @KateySagal @Nightline tonight! Thursday.
@DenisMacShane I'm not talking to anyone. Wrong Nick Watt :)
@sistersofsummer :(
@sistersofsummer Glad you liked. I did too. But staying home more is a plus...
@romanov_76_110 Sadly no more watt's world. A number of reasons... I'm disappointed. But happy to spend more time at home and on abc...
@romanov_76_110 Thank you sir :)
@Antissy Thanks you Cydney. That's very nice to here. Good start to my Friday :)
@cristobalCRE @jehorowitz Yup, I'm aftraid I misread once. Long day. My bad. Jordan, congrats on your success and grace.
@themarshallgrp @NicoleHanratty2 And a different version now also airing on Nightline tonight.
@CRS165 Ah. Thanks. Can't remember what was on his shirt. Logo, maybe.
@CRS165 Um, not sure what you mean? Am I missing insider Metallica joke?
I told them I'm a Fleetwood Mac guy. They were still very pleasant. https://t.co/JEfIm43CUD
@droidcam A little... And obviously i meant "enjoying" not "annoyed."
@AdamBuxton Rather enjoying the podcasts. Like having a chatty old friend from Blighty in the back seat.
@droidcam Rather annoying this series Mr Laurence. Particularly Grand Canal.
@eddiemair That interview with Steve Hewlett the most beautiful piece of radio I've ever heard. He's exceptional. You, the gold standard.
@steve_hewlett Listening to you in Los Angeles. Crying and chuckling. You've made me a little less scared. Thinking of you and yours.
@NivenJ1 A little light reading in Washington on eve of the inauguration https://t.co/9bPsNp806b
@BBCJonSopel Very much enjoying your coverage from Washington. Fantastic writing and context.
@seaden_amy I felt old enough to be their dad.
@romanov_76_110 And the same to you!
@kumailn You're almost my favorite Nanjiani now. Sherene still #1.
@itis_lindsEy Thank you. That's very nice to hear.
@elaine_peake Enjoy! It is rather good.
@AjayCnyc It is indeed.
@droidcam @LamaHasan that's why he wasn't at the premier! Hangin hard with Hasan in blighty.
@springcdt Sounds good. Speak to you in 2028 :)
@springcdt And a friendly bet... If it does become an Olympic sport, I think the U.S. will win. Just as they'll win rugby sevens by 2024.
@springcdt As I said multiple times on air, I hope it does become an Olympic sport. Good luck to you.
@springcdt Thanks for taking the time. As I suspected, nothing was inaccurate. And you totally misjudged my tone. Not condescending at all.
@springcdt Tell me what was inaccurate?
@droidcam Love it. Great photo.
@markpmeredith Thanks Mark. Nightline always worth watching :)
@JohnKingCNN You were great last night. Unbelievable broadcasting.
@romanov_76_110 @kendisgibson @dianermacedo I'm looking at my wife very suspiciously. Don't trust her.
@MontaukRugby Bloody hell Rich, it looks like the 1950s. Black and white! I feel old.
@BBCBlindGazza Debates doc on world service top notch. Big fan of all your reporting. Great work.
@romanov_76_110 @florindaricks Hey, don't start giving producers ideas like that. Colorado employment law was only thing keeping me out :)
@Jani_London  https://t.co/hZycZBR3hn
@songadaymann You on Nightline. Sorry for the delay. https://t.co/FGv1GSSOE5
@songadaymann could you dm me an email address?
@songadaymann Great. It's in. I'll send you a link tomorrow.
@songadaymann Great. Thanks a lot.
@songadaymann Hi. Love the Ken Bone song. Could we use a little of it on Nightline tonight?

@SamoJeff I didn't watch the trophy presentation this year. Usually I do.
@ffiano @paulafaris I believe Paula described it as some kind of edible confection...
@pat_molnar You may be the only person who's ever accused me of 'real' reporting :) Well, in a long time anyway!
@caber10 I was, of course, joking... Sorry for your pain :)
@singhdasa I believe you mean the other nick watt... Although he and I also look a little alike.
@sweetbugaboo2 @ABCWorldNewsNow Thanks very much!
@larbear1946 Thank you Larry!
@cjckittyluv1 Sadly (or happily) there will be no more. Lot of fun. But a long time away from home...
@rdavey321 Thank you very much :)
@jgorl804 Please. Cranston. Not you as well
@bryanbriggs6 It's actually my head made in Lego. Near Melrose in the Borders. Middle of nowhere.
@romanov_76_110 @dianermacedo @MattNelko @caitfallon Not my idea. To be clear.
@Captsully And longer version with Hanks on Nightline, I think sometime this week.
@Clayton_Sandell Great?
@wit_haze :)
@chrisearl9 Duchamp in London. In a good way... Yea, right...
@RockJunket Draws attention away from my ugly face.
@romanov_76_110 Thanks for the support!
@romanov_76_110 How did you know? Any tips?
@larbear1946 Thanks very much!
@lauracamblin thanks! :)
@Stone_SkyNews Hope we see you next week in London. I'll wear a neck brace too in solidarity.
@Jennyv307 @Outlander_STARZ Yes! We mentioned in our taped predictions package. Good stuff.
@drdannelly Tom Hollander was my favorite part of that show. Although he can't match Hiddlestone's smile :)
@nicholaswatt Congrats on the new job. You're not half bad on the telly. What a night. Keep up the good work...
@cjckittyluv1 Apparently he's a rather nice horse. Down to earth. Can't believe I'm saying all this about an animal.
@DaleEdgerton Sean is the only Scotsman who could ever fill the role.
@MontyPanesar Welcome back. You're an inspiring dude.
@cjckittyluv1 :)
@amazingmap If you really do mean "English" then use the English flag :)
@Landcross truth
@RaquelCiampi That's great to hear!
@C_Joyce3183 Thank you Colleen. Viva Inky
@ScottRogowsky You've arrived mate. And I rather liked the video.
@cjckittyluv1 Absolutely! Funny guy.
@TheHazelhut Yup. Can't take Scotland out of the boy. x
@SteveBrant Hi Steve. Glad you liked. Yea, we always cut down a bit. Although that interview in the flesh was pretty short!
@jayduplass Sorry to hear that. Love the show. You guys will just have to come up with something even better.
@mrsmediamom :)

@gfrisch Thanks Gary. I didn't think it was too bad. We shoot and edit to make room for the graphics.
@larbear1946 Hi Larry. Didn't develop it. Just the way I talk... I'm rubbish at doing an American accent.
@drdannelly Merry Christmas to you too!
@mpdaddy3 Sadly there is no second season. Happy Christmas to you too!
@rachel_boles That is impressive! Hope you're well.
@Dandeliondirtrd Ha! Thanks

@con926 Hi Connie. Aired already on GMA. Last Thursday I think. And in Nightline some time this week. Not sure when.
@frasereC4 Yes. And we may never get such a chance again.
@IamAustinHealey I've always liked you. And I don't say that about many English players :)
@JimVojtech No Jim. I disagree. Scotland unfairly beaten by Australia at the Rugby World Cup. (Well done Jake)
@FaisalAlkadiri Happy Birthday!!
@Tehaspe Great. Thanks.
@scambers73 Could you DM me an email address or number? Would love to pick your brain on a tennis story. I'm a reporter with American ABC.

@cjckittyluv1 It was a scorcher. No doubt.
@ValetControl Thanks Ed. Piggy knows how to play the game
@BenJCarlisle Totally! Scotland to win the whole thing...
@hatemyfingjob Funny. I mean it.
@cjckittyluv1 If people corrected all my strange British pronunciations, I;d never hear the end of it :)
@DaleEdgerton Thanks Dale. Sadly I don't think that's how it works :)
@AJVLivin Thanks Adam. Not so much for for bare ass screen grab... But for the kind words :)

@TheRochaSays And you! Glad you liked it. Was a good time.
@sincerely_steff I know. Totally.

@simonleake Thanks. And likewise.
@simonleake  They're showing the Australian coverage. So a bit of Mark Nicholas and then a whole lot of Aussies.

@TheMichaelMoran So he's a bit of a charlatan. But as a balding man (which is worse) I still envy his bonce.

BBC says he's a legit "independent market trader." Is he saying what they're all thinking? http://t.co/vKz3u4iU Thanks @TheMichaelMoran

@JillLawless Yes, feeling bad for tuning in to Big Brother. But I turned away after seeing Tara Reid's vacant, frightened eyes...

@biannagolodryga Royal dis? Well, tradition. Born 'common' so can't be 'Princess Catherine' but trad could've been tweaked
No mention that Kate will be 'Princess Catherine' So she's duchess and 'Princess William of Wales'? I think so.
Will and Kate will be duke and duchess of cambridge. I predicted that! If the dress is Issa, then I'm a seer!
William chosen red Irish Guards uniform. Not blue air force duds. Much more dashing.
Crowds camped at Buckingham Palace roaring and cheering a passing street sweeper. 5 hrs til Kate comes by

Kate 'n Wills to use same carriage as Chuck 'n Di. Tough to get out wearing wedding meringue. She'll practice. Watch on @GMA #royalwedding
