"Other leaders have acknowledged that Baptist churches are troubled by predators but that they could not interfere in local church affairs...[However] The SBC governing documents ban gay or female pastors, but they do not outlaw convicted sex offenders from working in churches."
SBC leadership: yes we have sexual predators in our denomination.		....and that's it.	That's the extent of their leadership.		Unbelievable.

So....his therapeutic practice is suspect; he doesn't want to pay anyone for their labor; and he thinks rape survivors should be forced to confront 'reality' for their recovery.		Don't even get me started on his tattoos.
He also wants to raise millions of dollars from foundations and since he has back problems he can't actually build this thing himself but he 'knows there are young people who want to learn how to build things. For food.'		😑😑😑
Way to be victim centered, dude. Also, good luck with that weird ass therapeutic utopia based on 'tough love' and your own issues.
And he legit said that even if women have experienced gender specific trauma he doesn't want to have single sex spaces.		Because 'triggers need to be forced.' it's 'bullshit if sexual trauma survivors don't want to be around men.'		'Getting better means confronting reality.'
So I'm listening to some dude explain to a woman his dream to create a mixed gender refuge for folks needing rehabilitation in the woods.

#FarewellFeministAndBlackBonaFides
Anti semitic acts of violence have been on a creeping rise over the past several years or more -- globally and also here in the States. Hang out on some chat rooms and see the virulent hate. Being mealy mouthed in the face of hate is...mealy.
His anti semitism is dangerous. It is dangerous to our Jewish brothers and sisters -- and it is a threat to black people and racial justice for all. When it comes to nationalism, these threats are *shared threats* and they are not mere poses.
So. If an unrepentant white supremacist (who's probably an anti semite) can be condemned for agreeing with, holding or repeating white supremacist views, I think it shld be a no brainer on the Left to say, Yep, Louis Farrakhan is a janky ass anti semite &amp; his views are terrible.
If Rep King and his leadership had pointed to canned remarks talking about his great legislative record not doing white supremacist things (this is a hypothetical) we would have immediately said, Nice spin, next.
While it took his leadership those same decades to condemn his bullshit at least they finally did it and seemed to draw a line (a shaky reluctant line) in the sand.
Let's start with Steve King. He has been condemned for saying, for repeating white supremacist views. His committee assignments have been snatched from him. And rightly so, right? Man has been an unrepentant hater for decades.

huh. **thinking**
we'd use HCD (human centered design) to be responsive to community experience and we'd invite design thinkers to be our partners in helping us design solutions to remove as much friction as possible in voting access.
we'd be a location-less org; mobile, tech savvy, policy savvy, and comfortable building relationships with npos on the ground for scale and reach. we'd also partner (or try) w/local election boards. we'd basically take an election cycle in a community and treat it like a lab.
i'd have a hard core training camp for youth advocates; a policy agenda focused on kicking down all those barriers to voting access (incl restoring voting rights to felons). we'd use data to target communities with low turnout and we'd use social labs to solve issues quickly.
if i was going to start a nonprofit, i'd start one with a mission to grow voting access among communities of color, youth, under resourced communities. it would have a legal/policy team, a field organizing + training team, and a kick ass media/digital strategy team.

But what will it take to galvanize all the other women to fight in their homes. Their communities. Their offices. To fight their husbands, bosses, senators.
Other women claim the space denied them in other ways. Overtly, covertly, politically, domestically. We are fighting. In our policed and exploited communities we fight. Showing up in places where we aren't supposed to be, in ways we aren't supposed to be, We fight.
Women of color aren't ever ceded the privilege of social protection. So in a way we have always been the insurgent. Policed, controlled, punished we are used to being ignored and banished. our rage is always at a low simmer and we take any chance we have to fight back.
Why white women? Because patriarchy uses white women's 'frailty' to excuse its barbarity to everyone else.

@ChicagoLeah Ha! Recovered!
Q) Think how far we could be if our sector had robust enough advocacy capacity to fight the fights we need to fight./end
P) If foundations aren't using every tool they can to meet their mission (&amp; spending more than that required 5% of their overall assets) then what is the point??
O)	Y'all can. You just don't want to educate your boards. Because that's where the barriers are. On philanthropic boards. 		Your board members are wrong. Plain wrong. And in these times they have a mission duty to leverage a full set of tools to solve problems.
N) The So What:	At a time when all the investments philanthropy has made in things like public education, early childhood, criminal justice, healthcare, immigration, etc., now is NOT the time to fall back on that myth that foundations can't support lobbying or advocacy.
M)	Generally, under an expense based limit like a 501h election, orgs have more room to move.		The expenditure limit is clearer.
L)	As an advocate a community foundation CAN do both direct and grassroots lobbying up to their IRS limit.		Y'all can't go over.		What this means: a community foundation can act like a grantmaker AND a nonprofit, giving it more advocacy capacity.		(Hint: solicit community fdns)
K)	Community foundations cannot 		💀 conduct or fund electioneering activity		💀 exceed its lobbying limits (either 'insubstantial' standard or the 501h limit)
J)	Rules for Community Foundations		You can:	🤔 give gen ops support to orgs that lobby	🤔 make project specific grants for projects that include lobbying	🤔make grants that support advocacy		Lookit all you can do!!
I)	Back to the rules:		Private foundations MAY NOT		💀earmark grants specifically for lobbying		💀fund political campaign/electioneering activity		Rally against untested census questions yes	Rally for a candidate no
H)	Those certain steps are usually around building a wall around the direct lobbying portion of the grantee activity thru their budget.		You can find the grantee's **entire project** as long as they cover the direct lobbying expenses.		Think about that.
G)	Basic rules for private foundations:		🤔You can give gen ops to orgs that lobby	🤔You can give project specific grants to orgs that INCLUDE lobbying as long as certain steps are taken	🤔Make grants to support lobbying
F)	All of that is advocacy.	And it's allowed.	For foundations to fund and nonprofits to do.
@ChicagoLeah Effing twitter ate my thread.
E)	Foundations can achieve that impact thru:	Public education	Funding Policy work (&amp; the capacity for it)	Research	Training &amp; TA	Relationship bldg	regulatory advocacy	**Issue or policy advocacy**
D) So what's the kind of impact foundations care about?		They care about learning what works	Identifying needs	Creating solutions	Using resources strategically	Sharing with the field	Convening doers
C) Why should foundations care abt and support advocacy?		Because it strengthens your strategic grantmaking.	And most of the issues philanthropy cares about are addressed through advocacy. 		Not merely direct services.
B) You can't get big scale systems change without some kind of advocacy work. Grassroots or otherwise. Like, y'know -- lobbying. 😱
A) First, it is entirely legal for private foundations to advocate for systems change.		And I concentrate on systems change because public policy decisions contribute directly to it.
Y'all, i'm about to go in on #foundations+funding #advocacy. 		In my past life i did nonprofit policy work - so this is **squarely** in my wheelhouse. Talking abt philanthropy &amp; advocacy engagement is my jam.		What follows is a Twitter version of a talk i gave a couple yrs ago.

@facebook and it's kind of interesting to see how that imposed silence falls on the remaining sector that's poised to resist this administration and all its harms with a vigor it hasn't had before.
@facebook intentions don't matter. impact does. 	so with this new rule, while the intention has been to curb janky news and russian interference, the actual impact is that nonprofits who have a free speech right to talk about their missions are falling silent.	that's...a problem.
@facebook this rule flattens the difference between the fake news from russians &amp; legit news stories &amp; straight up partisan ads &amp; content from nonprofits working on important issues.
@facebook yeah, it's cool to complain about FB. but this is a legitimate concern. it's our job to reach our own followers and tell them a law is bad or goes against our mission, or that we're working on laws to improve gender rights. 		if FB muzzles us, it interferes with our work.
@facebook we posted a video about who we are and why we do our work. it was flagged for political speech. we appealed. it was allowed to run.		a few days later that same video was flagged again for being political. this time, our appeal was rejected. what the heck, FB?
@facebook what's 'political'? boosted posts that 'mention candidates for public office, are about elections, or that discuss any of 20 “national issues of public importance”'. Civil rights are included in that list of 20. https://t.co/rzhM9JcjA3
@facebook but the upshot is that if i don't do this my org, a civil rights organization, will basically have all its content rendered invisible. because it's 'political.'
@facebook their solution to russians interfering with folks on their platform is to force orgs to verify that we are basically not russian. fine. TOS stuff. here's my personal data.
so...can we talk about how @facebook is limiting 'political' speech on its platform and how it's affecting orgs like mine?

@ChicagoLeah @LaurelSnyder @jfederations I've seen a lot of big nonprofits avoid wading into public issues because of fear of blow back - especially from very large (vocal) donors. But pressure from all kinds of donors also matters.

@PressSec Paul is urging the Romans to submit to govt that is 'of' God. Learn ya Bible.	When a govt goes against our basic tenets of faith (like suffering the children to come &amp; to love our neighbors as ourselves) our christian duty is to fight this and #Resist it. the Lord tells us so.
@PressSec maybe your baptist sunday school training taught you the word 'exegesis.' In Romans 12 Paul tells Romans to overcome evil with good - but then he tells them in 13 to submit to Nero, b/c he's from God? Nope.
@PressSec your baptist sunday school training means you know that in the same sermon Paul also says to pay taxes. so which is it? 'follow the rules of govt' and snatch kids from families AND pay taxes? so your christianity allows one but not another? @PressSec
@PressSec shenanigans on using Pauline scripture to justify breaking that very basic injunction to break with the Law and follow God's law (um, Love thy neighbor).

9. And I killed a terrible nonprofit FOIA bill 3x.
8. Nonprofits that take their public trust seriously stick to the 9 rules of governance as seen in the IL Nonprofit Best Practices and Policies.		My old org literally wrote the book on governance.
7. We also report on our programs and finances to multiple donor segments: govt, foundations. Sometimes we report multiple times in one fiscal year.
6. You can look up our tax records (unlike some presidents)
5. We file public 990s at the federal and state level.
4. Nonprofits five their audoted financials to anyone who ask. It's a best practice.
3. We are more transparent however than both the private sector and govt.
2. Nonprofits are just as private as AT&amp;T.

why am i thinking about this?	i'm part of an online community of nonprofit communication pros and i am SO glad they exist. i've been catching up on posts today and we are literally all experiencing the same exact things. everywhere.

and what does *every single* nonprofit comms pro complain about?		their orgs going absolutely rogue at every point of the comms process. it is maddening. 		imagine, a profession filled with people who want sonnets being in orgs who like limericks. or even worse, free verse.
so as a nonprofit comms person, you need the structure and discipline of process and practice so the creativity and brightness of your org can shine more brilliantly.
being a nonprofit pro is like writing a sonnet.	when i was in undergrad, sonnets were my favorite poetic form to read because there was a very rigid structure but the brilliance was in how you could break and play w/in it.

@22ndtimeout Foundations are 501c3 but there are different kinds of fdns; they file different tax forms (like a PF 990 if they're a private foundation. A typical charitable org files a 990.) A public charity can call itself a 'foundation' but that doesn't mean they're a *grantmaking* org.
@justchelle So I stopped walking, turned, looked at him and then resumed walking when he passed me. Navigating weirdness is exhausting. Constant threat assessment.

'judges found that the legal safeguards created to protect citizens **had been undone** as one ICE superior after another approved Watson’s detention without reviewing his case records.'

'an ICE official wrote that it was agency practice to tell citizens that the burden was on them to obtain written proof of their legal status to ensure they would not be wrongly targeted again.'		That's not how govt should work.
Seriously, if i was crap at my job like this I'd be fired.

calls to action now from the panel.	giving opportunities to women that they never had before - this happens for men *literally all the time*. it's time to do it for women.		#futureofwork #usow2018
great final poll question: where should we start to redesign the modern workplace? 		leading responses so far: modernize and diversity work cultures (56%); increase women's advancement; pay equity.		#futureofwork #usow2018
changing the culture of work means problematizing the 'she's difficult' narrative. interrogate the stories being told about women in the workplace.		#futureofwork #usow2018
and lastly, @MsPackyetti - ending cash bail is also part of #futureofwork. 		(for black and brown women, our work lives are connected to the other crap that happens to us and our families, communities.) #usow2018
@MsPackyetti - equity audits also part of how companies can demonstrate a real commitment to changing work culture. clear processes for hiring and firing. inclusion = permission to be your full self. #futureofwork #usow2018
@MsPackyetti solution: as a leader, she builds in, and measures staff on culturally responsive leadership and intersectional identity work. these are intentional, measured expectations of employees in order to created equitable environments. #Futureofwork #usow2018
ok I'm taking a break from lady business for some intersectional stuff. Cops called on 4 black women for not waving to a white lady after leaving an air bnb.		This is what we carry with us when we go to work. https://t.co/sjlqq23GnF
solution: a policy like the FAMILY Act could help with paid family leave &amp; paid sick days challenges. it allows for work to still be done while easing a constraint on the employer and the employee on leave still gets support. it's a triple win. via @sffink #Futureofwork #usow2018
solutions: transparency around sexual harassment at employers provides incentive for women as consumers &amp; potential employers, as well as a more effective reporting mechanism with the EEOC. #futureofwork

Listening to @KQEDForum talk about dating platforms and the conversation is SO vanilla. In so many ways.		Dating and sexual culture is so different. Where's kink, where's other sexualities? Marginal sexualities?
And yeah I'm not just talking about 'let's have dinner' type of dating. Folks are complex and Americans already have issues with nontraditional sexuality. And now Facebook (the most socially awkward platform out there) wants to get involved? Honey, no.
When we date or whatever you want to call it, we present ourselves in very particular ways and some of us don't necessarily want that shenanigans persona blending with the professional or filial personas we have.
