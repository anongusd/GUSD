@KatieWallsWSB You're killing it tonight. Floods, high winds, then freezing cold. Nice menu choices.
@NunurBizness1 @high5assfuck @KristySwansonXO @AOC Ha! Gooooooaaaaal!
@Dano44blue @HLAurora63 @skb_sara @GOP @GOPChairwoman @Jim_Jordan @RepMarkMeadows @realDonaldTrump Or an aversion. It's not only fear. If you strongly disapprove of something strongly that can also be included in phobia.
Validated. https://t.co/2BhTDwXXDB
@Dano44blue @HLAurora63 @skb_sara @GOP @GOPChairwoman @Jim_Jordan @RepMarkMeadows @realDonaldTrump That's only part of the definition, but I hear you loud and clear.
@HLAurora63 @skb_sara @GOP @GOPChairwoman @Jim_Jordan @RepMarkMeadows @realDonaldTrump Phobia. One of my most favorite, misused words. Do you know the full definition of phobia?
@pytntheboy @RealJamesWoods I laughed.
@KatieWallsWSB No thanks. https://t.co/tmXWszrCYm
Hey, @danabrams, where can we get autographed @LivePDNation trading cards? #livepd #LivePDNation
Everyone is created equal. From there on out we separate ourselves. Many times, inequality is based on preexisting conditions. Most times it is based on choices made in life.
"Georgia voting machines have never been hacked." There is a lot of scuttle about the vulnerability of electronic voting machines. Yep, everything connected to the Internet is vulnerable. Nothing special in Georgia.
Sometimes you just have to laugh and carry on. Stirring the pot can be super entertaining.
@thejesseclifton @flysaa Apparently one doesn't "need" a license to fly lol
@thejesseclifton Let her roll. Give her some rope. She may just be able to single handedly expose socialism in America better than all of us out together. She's the best asset any operator could hope for. No power but plenty of mouth.

I never want to downplay anything below what it really is but United Drive in Huger, South Carolina is not a highly populated area. So don't take the reports without video as a typical "active shooter" situation. https://t.co/ZhWw5XbWNq
@emilie_ikeda how many acres of pecan trees were destroyed?
@rosalokeyorbe @DailySignal The transgender is waging war on women?
"Some bad people will cause other people to believe things that are not true. These bad people, and all other bad people, will become worse and worse. And they themselves will also believe things that are not true."	2 Timothy 3:13 Easy English Bible
@KayaJones They are willfully deceived.
@patsajak @msjeannerogers Hahaha! And that's why we love you.
@Sean_C_Larkin Maybe she's trying to make her farts smell better. #bethankful
@AOC Your imagination had Tim so far away you may never see it again. Then again, you probably haven't been able to control it ever.
@ChuckCallesto Good. Let her pay first.
Yes, I do actually still have my #Blockbuster card from the mid 90's. #be_kind_rewind https://t.co/WLYkY37dP9
@SimplyDenise @DrAndreaRaquel YAVW 😉
@Liz_Wheeler To answer the question, "what's wrong with these people" I ask another: "What type of people make insane, dangerous, false statements?"
@w_terrence That was great. Thanks for sharing.
@BuckSexton @RealSaavedra Great responses. There's a bit of discussion about lowering the voting age. I would actually consider backing a movement to raise it.
@Mushele @AOC Yep. Adult ones. And grandkids. And a good grip on reality.
@DailDawson1 Dail, that's a unique name.
@Se7enSquared you're new to Twitter.
@TomFitton @CPAC Speak truth! I know you're going to do great. I will not be there this year and it's going to be the best one yet. Hate to miss it.
@AOC Actually we're just laughing. At you. Thinking you're in charge. And coming up with fantastic solutions for imaginary crises.
@RealSaavedra Me too. With popcorn.
@BuckSexton @RealSaavedra For the edification of all, in your opinion, at what age should people be able to embrace and share their own opinions and expect respect?
@mwilsonua @ProudResister So you just throw around derogatory and manufactured labels for lack of reason. Got it.
@mwilsonua @ProudResister Just a garden variety hater?
@DiamondandSilk @ScreamngEagle Her handlers and benefactors haven't figured that out yet. We know she's incapable.
@ProudResister @mwilsonua Does that make you feel violent?
@danabrams @OfficialLivePD #shakinmyweewee
@RealSaavedra You started that statement with "MSNBC" so there's no surprise.
@GolfClashGame servers down?
@Devildog683 @Kat_MacDonald @k9_keno @chaseelliott @BubbaWallace @dirtgirlatheart @NASCAR @amsupdates Welcome to Georgia.
@SenSchumer Says the man who wishes no limits on when a baby can be killed. Try again.
@harikondabolu When did it happen? It didn't happen to him and the other mysterious events you mention -- prove them.
@AbdulElSayed Nope. It would cost Carly more than that. Then what would you have? Socialism ruins nations. It has been proven time and again. Thanks for playing, try again.
@candyboot @ChrisBr83143864 @gailborges @CPD1962 @chicksonright @RepSwalwell @SteveKingIA I'm sure if you try you could display more angst.
@candyboot @ChrisBr83143864 @gailborges @CPD1962 @chicksonright @RepSwalwell @SteveKingIA You said "white guys" and "triggered".
@AB89x The (unreasonable) love of money is the root of evil.
@RealSaavedra I'm looking for my shocked face. Nevermind, I don't need it.
@chicksonright @RepSwalwell I'll take "What's wrong with Congress" for $200, Alex.
@KatieWallsWSB Lots of lightening right now near Bells Ferry and 575.
@michaeljohns @jennybethm @ericjodom just reminiscing about all those hours long phone calls/conferences 10 years ago when things were hopping. Hope you're all well. #TeaParty
It only took a short time for the pathetic rancor of @AOC to get this #TeaParty cofounder to agree with @NYGovCuomo on something big for NYC. #thatsafirst @RealSaavedra
@DChandleyFOX5 woah! Lightening strike less than 1/2 mile from my house near Bells Ferry and 575. Loud.
@JoanneFOX5 big thunder Bells Ferry near 575. Close strikes within 2 miles @FOX5Atlanta
@RealSaavedra From all I read and hear about the things she says and supports, @SenWarren is, apparently, a vapid shell of a facsimile of a right thinking human. It is the embracing of such willful ignorance that could damn this nation and our true allies.
When my nephew does it, I just shrug. When @Dictionarycom does it, I cringe. #grammar https://t.co/ktY7y9mkfh
@thejesseclifton I hope you're doing well. I miss you.
I don't hate any person because of their sin. I was a most wretched sinner myself. Worse than most because I knew the Truth and rejected it for many years. I don't judge the person but I will call out sin amongst my friends when it is keeping them from God's blessings. #woke
@technyc77 Yep but a rare job. I always tell people the ones we leave at home have the harder time. When we're deployed it's with friends and brothers but they are at home worrying about what we're doing.
@technyc77 welcome home, brother. Thank you for your service.
@tedeschi_ann I guess she won't mind if we pray that the Holy Spirit convict her of her sins and she turns to Jesus.
@CurseOfOak ghost hunters on the island? More popcorn please.
@JFrickinAdams That was wrong but it doesn't compare to stemming a slow, deliberate invasion. Although I personally would not have declared, your comparing apples to oranges.
Wow. This is probably one of the best ways I've seen to cattle call the weakest bunch of people to weigh in on a 40 year old article.
@jasoncrouch @ananavarro Satan is the father of lies. So his children are going to lie.
@ananavarro Why must you manufacture such trash? This is the only place I've even seen her name in 2 days.
@JackPosobiec @JELynchElliott I don't care about their stories. I already know what I need to know. You rejected America, it's no longer your home. You're terrorists and not welcome here.
@ChuckCallesto She is home. She rejected America. Repent and find Jesus but not here.
@RealSaavedra 16 year olds don't even know when to change their underwear. Neither do most 21 year olds. Amplify the stupid to the n-th power.
@mikewil102 It actually started with Carter in '77 but got big teeth through Clinton's pen.
If I ever got a burger at @SteaknShake that looked remotely similar to the ones in their commercials I would look around to see where I was. #comeonman
Blame falls on the church. The blame for socialism, the blame for broken families and rampant crime. The fault is of the church. If the church really followed the teachings of Jesus, socialism would not be a problem because it wouldn't be a "need". #church #MAGA
I know Trump haters won't read this but interesting people who want to know the truth may.  https://t.co/Zl6RjQSrOa
@charliekirk11 @mglessman Don't you love it when you tweet truth and the weak opposition can do nothing better than deflect?
@DarcyDelia @charliekirk11 @mikewil102 Research the Community Reinvestment Act and the penalties for Banks who don't make "fair lending" mean "access to all".

@JacobAWohl @Rebecca01281 He not the brightest Juan in the room.
@Megan4MAGA @SandraTXAS I'm sure they won't mind if we pray for them.
I figure this: I'm on this planet for maybe 30 more years max. I'm going to live to please God and not bow down to social demands. And I'm not going to make up my own method of pleasing God. His way, not mine. Not yours. Not the world's.
@cottonelle What does that have to do with my tweet?

@GoDaddy @GoDaddyHelp We're good. Hello was a little slow getting back to me but they did. Thanks.
After 20+ years I'm breaking up with @cottonelle. Too bad. Beware what you embrace. Be more aware what you promote.

Genesis Chapter One. Everything God created he said it was good; except when he created humans. After he created us he said it was very good. God created us for his pleasure - when we please him he blesses us.

@KatieWallsWSB @GlennBurnsWSB @BradNitzWSB I don't care who you are, that's not funny. The National Guard is ready to serve!
@johnpavlovitz How is this remotely #WednesdayMotivation? It's a sad attempt to increase your "audience" by coat tailing.
@ChrisJZullo How is this even close to #WednesdayMotivation?
Leave it to social media to turn #WednesdayMotivation into a platform for "hate speech". Let's try it without jabbing at any group of people, deal?
@ChrisJZullo The US is nowhere near the top. It doesn't mean we don't have some issues to address, it just means we're not close to the top. (Graphic By Jroehl - Own work: List of countries by firearm-related death rate, CC BY-SA 4.0, https://t.co/dQVwsxTSPi) https://t.co/1SLvLt240K

@KatieWallsWSB @wsbtv Okay winter. That's good. Thank you. Please stop.
@ChuckCallesto Maybe @Alyssa_Milano should spend a few nights around Terre Haute and see just how different they are.
I really wanted the #Rams to win tonight, but not this way. #Saints #NFLPlayoffs
@JohnStossel Ha. You're not that ignorant of what's going on.

@tweethue did my scenes stop working with Google Home due to your servers being overloaded with Christmas newbies?
Dear @tweethue I'm giving you the benefit of the doubt that your servers are overloaded post Christmas. Unfortunately, I've spent too long arriving at that assumption....
To all the liberals fleeing failing towns, cities, and states: leave that crap there and come to the light!
Say "Hey Google, play": Relaxing sounds, Nature sounds, Water sounds, Running water sounds, Babbling brook sounds, Oscillating fan sounds, Fireplace sounds, Forest sounds, Country night sounds, Ocean sounds, Rain sounds, River sounds, Thunderstorm sounds, White noise.
Merry Christmas to everyone. https://t.co/6XqYi54dZe
@KatieWallsWSB So we're already the wettest we've been and getting several more inches this weekend? Sounds like a few logs in the fire and a good Scotch is in order.
@RealMattCouch @LVNancy BuzzFeed sucks. But, I'm not a fan of us funding the wall. We've already paid enough in taxes; make the Dems get on board and fund it with our money they already have.
@KatieWallsWSB Yay. Several inches for the weekend.
I'm having trouble seeing the #Seahawks on TV. No trouble seeing the #Vikings - must be something with the set. #SeahawksvsVikingsLive #NFL

@missycaulk @RealSaavedra Hey Missy! I'm not so much for more regulation but definitely for competition. Of course what that results in is division over mindsets. Funny how the left is more of what they accuse the right of being.

@SenSanders Healthcare is open and available to everyone in America. There's no one blocking anyone from access to health care.

@MelissaKempski It's the greatest secular subject I can think of #Constitution
@katystoll The US Constitutional already covers equal rights regardless of GENDER. Hopefully everyone is having sex. The 14th Amendment specifically addresses gender equality and SCOTUS has further defined it. If you studied Constitutional Law at Yale, you would already know that.
@JohnWDean October 39, 2010 - and several dates preceding and surrounding. That's be Obama "not running the country".

@aliberalteen_ Proved nothing. You're not even using a sound presentation. You're just throwing out numbers. And they aren't even the right numbers.
@aliberalteen_ All you liberals want to lump gangland murders into a big pile and point. What guns were used in London? People kill people.
@aliberalteen_ What's your point? Are you wanting more deaths? Obviously they are being controlled here. Open your eyes child. Accept the truth.
Oh, look! @aliberalteen_ A convert to Islam guns down five innocents in the baggage claim area of an airport. Jan 6, 2017 - Ft Lauderdale

IT'S OVER!	TEXAS - 38 for Trump (304 total)	1 for Ron Paul 	1 for John Kasich
Patrick Leahy has been serving in the US Senate representing Vermont since 1975. Nineteen SEVENTY FIVE. Is he really the only choice?
At this point Clinton would need California, Texas, Nevada, and 2 more to even be able to win. And that's about all that are left.
@jososs ha! I'm just glad they're not from mine. :D

Listen; "hate crime" is a divisive term that compartmentalizes and marginalizes. Crime is crime, period. All victims deserve equal justice.
Indiscriminately and four are the operative terms. The anti-gun, fear mongering, alt-left is lying to you about 1000's of mass shootings.
A "mass shooting" is clearly defined as "four or more people selected indiscriminately, not including the perpetrator, are killed". Cont'd

@jasoncrouch I only selected most posts (except the first several) from 2011 and back. When I ran the app and came to Twitter .... *poof*
@jasoncrouch almost all of those posts had bad links in them or were about mortgages. Tired of getting mortgage phone calls!
@adrigonzo 8 years ago I was swimming in funds .... today not so much. How about I buy one but we get two straws?
@jasoncrouch me too. And those tweets. I downloaded an app to delete everything from before 2012 .... and I did. Everything after, too.
