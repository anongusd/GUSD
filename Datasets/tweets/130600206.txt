The Senate is now voting on The Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act. Read our key vote in support of this legislation here: https://t.co/fOVLqerGW6
Melissa Ohden survived a saline abortion. Now she is speaking out in favor of the #BornAliveAct so that more babies like her will be protected under the law, saying "...we desperately need that Born-Alive Survivors Protection Act to ensure that we’re provided medical care.” https://t.co/1RF1BjC6au
This legislation provides a scientific, medically accurate, and ethical approach to human life. No matter how you look at it, opposition to the #BornAliveAct is completely indefensible.
The #BornAliveAct would ensure that babies born during failed abortion procedures receive the same standard of medical care as any other baby—they would be admitted to a hospital instead of being left to die.
The #BornAliveAct would fix a broken law that currently allows medical practitioners to kill babies by refusing them medical care.
It is morally wrong to refuse medical care to babies born-alive from a failed abortion. They should not be neglected and left to die. They should receive the same standard of medical care than any other baby would receive.
Babies are babies, no matter where or why they are born. There is no scientific or legal reason to distinguish between human beings born after an attempted abortion and human beings born after an attempted live birth.
When it comes to medical facts, there is little to dispute. Facts are facts, and here are five important things to consider when it comes to the #BornAliveAct that is being voted on by the Senate today:
The Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act advances a culture of respect for life that has been abandoned by the political left. 		Infants who are born alive in abortion clinics, should have the same rights and access to medical care as any other baby.
The Senate is set to vote on the Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act today, which would require that appropriate medical care be given to any child who survives an attempted abortion.	Congress has the opportunity to stand with the most vulnerable Americans #BornAliveAct

Thank you @BetsyDeVosED for taking steps to keep our children safe by returning disciplinary control back to local schools. https://t.co/tvpEgptt9c
School districts have felt the effects of Obama’s progressive approach to school discipline. In Broward County, the policies the letter imposed nationwide created a climate that may have allowed the Stoneman Douglas shooter to slip through the cracks. https://t.co/GN26ccL5Gr
The Obama administration’s “Dear Colleague” letter was an overreach of the federal government—there is nothing in the Constitution that authorizes the Secretary of Education to dictate local school discipline policy.
A few days before Christmas, @BetsyDeVosED restored order to our schools by rescinding an Obama-era “Dear Colleague” letter on school discipline. This is great news. The guidance was an insult to the separation of powers, federalism, and the rule of law. https://t.co/IHqWsTzYKr

There are over 400,000 children across the nation awaiting foster care and 100,000 awaiting adoptive families. Faith-based organizations, which are at the heart of child welfare services and serve these children in need, are under attack for their religious beliefs.
Faith-based adoption agencies increase the number of children placed in loving homes each year. #KeepKidsFirst	https://t.co/U2N5BerOiz
Press Release: Heritage Action Supports the Child Welfare Provider Inclusion Act (H.R. 1881) as an Amendment to the FY 2019 Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education appropriations bill	https://t.co/ZV5nNHlrwN
This morning, the Appropriations Committee will discuss next year’s Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education Appropriations Bill. By adding the Child Welfare Provider Inclusion Act (H.R. 1881), Congress can pass pro-family, bipartisan legislation.  #KeepKidsFirst

89% of people agree that the best way to help children in need of adoption is to draw from a wide range of adoptive families and agencies, including faith-based organizations. The Child Welfare Provider Inclusion Act (H.R. 1881) protects those agencies and #KeepsKidsFirst
The Child Welfare Provider Inclusion Act (H.R. 1881) protects faith-based adoption and foster agencies. Congress must include this bill in the 2019 LHHS appropriations bill to #KeepKidsFirst &amp; give children a chance to be adopted into loving families.
