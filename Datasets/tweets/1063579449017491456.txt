@Keefer1958 @RepJayapal It's a Dem ploy, for sure. But just so you know the facts &amp; ppl. won't say you're wrong...what you said is not true. Per the Constitution it's the # of people, not citizens. We should amend it, so it does say that. The founding father's never thought of mass immigration.
@vulareese @RepJayapal That definitely seems to be a part of the agenda.
@hart_hole @RepJayapal The fear Dems have is that ICE will use that info to deport ppl. The census may not be confidential or protected data.

@CharlesDoucette @RealJamesWoods What!?  Are you ok...is it a stroke or are you drunk? Kinda early in the day, Lush Larue.😂😂😂😂😂😂
@CharlesDoucette @RealJamesWoods Why a Twitter pic means anything, is just another dumb point. I could put anything up there. 😕 The baby on yours is super-duper cute btw. Congrats, grandpa.
@CharlesDoucette @RealJamesWoods If you think I'm a kid, that means you've purposely chosen to debate a kid all this time...and you're losing badly. That would make you a moron &amp; a troll. Why Show pics of a wall, not even being built😂😂 Why refuse to answer questions? You're bad at Twitter, Chuck.😂😂😂
@CharlesDoucette @RealJamesWoods Israel is the largest cumulative recipient of U.S. foreign assistance since World War II. REPUBLICAN or Democrat. Look that up, HS valedictorian.  To date, the United States has provided Israel $134.7 billion...guess who has a wall &amp; Universal healthcare?
@CharlesDoucette @RealJamesWoods Here is an opinion: I don't believe you know the definition of equivalent, talking points, or facts. Example : It was $5.7B - fact. Not $57B - opinion.😂😂😂 Your not on my level, Chuck.	But your blind persistence is funny.

@Roxmoo @MrDane1982 Took way to long for someone to say this!😄😄
@CharlesDoucette @RealJamesWoods 3. I'm more educated than you &amp; lived on the border but that doesn't mean you can't prove a point. Once again, SHOW ME two verified facts you have presented. Just 2 and answer some questions...I dare you or are you just an ignorant troll. Prove me wrong.
@CharlesDoucette @RealJamesWoods 3. Are you a "BUILD THE WALL" fanatic or do you really want our govt to stop illegal immigrants? I didn't insult you, until you insulted my intelligence.  I have more debate trophies than you have real teeth &amp; your comprehension skills are child like. No how was that productive?
@CharlesDoucette @RealJamesWoods 2. I NEVER said a wall is bad,  I said it will NOT lessen crime, I SAID it's expensive as proposed, I said there's other ways to do it. Everything I said is true, but if you don't believe it,  you should google it. It's not hard. Why are you so scared to learn? It's sad for you.
@CharlesDoucette @RealJamesWoods Still haven't answered 1 question. 😂😂 Just admit my two degrees outmatch your diploma. Name one talking point I said. Your not even fact checking my tweets &amp; I know you didn't read one article I tweeted. There's no debate b/c your in bad faith, you don't want to fact check.

@CharlesDoucette @RealJamesWoods 😂😂😂You never answer questions &amp; continually divert.	I knew you wouldn't answer the ques. so far it's clearly been beyond your knowledge. What facts did you give? I looked thru the thread, I don't see any. 😂Only unverifiable statements... I'll even point them out.😂
@CharlesDoucette @RealJamesWoods 3.  The wall will be patrolled by agents? The border is 2000 miles, there are 2 agents per 10 miles of border. You do the math. It's like you want to say dumb things, like some internet troll. Actually that makes more sense, then you being so dumb to think you've given facts.
@CharlesDoucette @RealJamesWoods 2. You Compared Israel border to Southern border. That is so stupid, only an uneducated moron would believe that assumption. I tried to make you aware of the difference. What makes it so bad, if you don't understand, you can look it up yourself.
@CharlesDoucette @RealJamesWoods So far here are your facts:	Two wrongs dont make a right.	I agree, but that is not a fact. That is opinion.	The wall will lessen crime.	Prove it.	You will find no study, report, data or stat to prove this.
@CharlesDoucette @RealJamesWoods I don' t watch MSM at all, it is like the POTUS says fake news. You can keep your ad hominem attacks, as well. If you don't have the intelligence to prove a point w/ data, that's not my fault. Do you watch FOX? You seem very misinformed.
@realDonaldTrump Your 100% correct, but No POTUS is allowed to stop the Industtrial military complex (the permanent state) w/out permission.	Your crossing the wrong line, if you try to pull out of these needless, endless wars. Trillions of $ &gt; Thousands of lives.
@realDonaldTrump LIAR!!
@CharlesDoucette @RealJamesWoods You have an opinion not based on fact. I want a wall, just not the one proposed. It's a waste. But please believe what you want. It's like Ann Coulter said today, his base is stupid enough to believe anything.
@CharlesDoucette @RealJamesWoods *patrol* 😄 There's not enough manpower to defend the border, the walls are used to funnel traffic, that is all. I'm not trying to convince you of anything, so there's no failure to be had. I'm stating facts, anyone who has their mind made up, regardless of logic is the failure.
@CharlesDoucette @RealJamesWoods Not spinning, just providing facts. I don't care if you believe them, I just call ppl. out when they say dumb things like "a wall will help stop crime" w/ no data &amp; stats to prove it...I know denying science &amp; facts is the new normal, but it creates ignorance. That's not useful.

@CharlesDoucette @RealJamesWoods Do you believe that prototype is the fence their planning to build for 55 or 235 or 2000 miles? $1.37B is approx. $25M per mile. Do you think that will be approved for 235 or 2000 miles w/out lawsuits? Also, They can dig the tunnels deeper, right?	https://t.co/tbAMhl4zSg
@YrPal_Lefty Awesomely Awesome Awesomeness!!
@marcorubio How is this POS an elected official? Religion truly is the devil's work.
@CharlesDoucette @RealJamesWoods 2. The BDP or military cannot use lethal force to stop crossings. The BDP have to "catch &amp; release." The "emergency" will be in court for a lifetime &amp; stopped by the next admin. Neither party wants to really stop this problem, it's obvious. Look up equivalent.
@CharlesDoucette @RealJamesWoods 1. You've been struggling w/ this for a few days now, so I'll help you out. POTUS asked for 235 mi. of new wall &amp; got 55 for a fence in one area.	The border is 2000 mi.	It can't be cement or barbed wire, like most places have done successfully &amp; cheaply &amp; MX is not paying $35+B.
@CharlesDoucette @RealJamesWoods Clearly, you don't know what equivalent means. 😪 It cannot be militarized w/out being approved by State &amp; Executive legislatures, so for now it can only be a steel slat fence as Pelosi approved &amp; tunnels will be built under it by the cartels. What else ya got?
@CharlesDoucette @RealJamesWoods False equivalent. Those walls are militarized/war zones and cost way more than $6B &amp; do not cover the amount of miles, terrain or territory of the Southern border. Is your thought, to militarize a border of an allied country? Also, there is crime in Israel. Anymore bad examples?
@SenSchumer @realDonaldTrump They don't care about the Founder's vision, their still mad about civil, women &amp; gay rights. They don't care what you think, they hate you. You are the enemy and they will lie, cheat &amp; steal to defeat you. The sooner you recognize that, the smarter you will be. Now, go fight!!
@CharlesDoucette @RealJamesWoods Unfortunately, that's not true about crime. You'll not find any report, study, data, or stat to prove that point. Real ways to minimize illegals &amp; crime are never discussed by either party or MS media.	Believe who &amp; what you want, but know as a fact, a 55 mi. wall stops nothing.

African American men 18-30 yrs old. Is there a fix?
@toxicberry @billprady @TheDemocrats @GOP 1. You're not wrong, but "despise" is casting some large generalizations on the Dems, who increasingly have more diversity in the party by volumes in comparison to the R's and their agenda. The real issue is possibly turnout, do you have any thoughts on this:
@therealcpw @SenStabenow 5. Also, not debatable is voter suppression which has been proven to exist &amp; measures should be implemented to ensure it cannot occur.  Campaign finance seems a problematic issue as well. 	I presume you read the article/looked at the bill...or did you just comment on the title?
@therealcpw @SenStabenow 4. Also, because something has been around a long time, doesn't mean its not an awful practice and should be corrected or eliminated. That's not even debatable.
@therealcpw @SenStabenow 3. YOU'RE right voting is not difficult, but the proposed laws suggest making it more secure &amp; even easier to vote, like addition/subtraction is not hard, but easier with a calculator. Most ppl. like working smarter, not harder.
@therealcpw 2. Understand, I'm not calling you a communist, I used "you're" to save characters, which you have thought was first person, I meant "you are" as if any person objecting to free, incorruptible elections.
@therealcpw @SenStabenow 1. Dial it back tough guy.

@KMartin1311 @ALSouthpaw @SylviaRBeachy @RobertWestover9 @JBolo9476 @DanCrenshawTX 8. $6B is pricey for 235 mi. of "NEW" wall out of 1700 mi. of wide open border. That's $24M per mi. = $24.5K for every 5 ft. of wall. Walls around the 🌎, that are equivalent, are militarized/war zones &amp; mainly, barbed wire.

@delkevis @SenStabenow Absolutely. 75% participation changes the game forever. Obviously 100% is unlikely but you can imagine how that would destroy this two party system. Both R's &amp; D's are resistant to that. 	F__k border security...election security is the National threat.
@therealcpw @SenStabenow I don't watch any MSM, but having it more difficult to vote, suppression, gerrymandering &amp; no finance reform is being traitorous to all democratic principles.

@SenSchumer 1. The myth is that higher turnout favors the Democrats, in the cities it's more of a hassle to vote. More ppl. would vote if the this bill passed, 15% increase from 55% to 70% kills the GOP party forever.

@eveinthesky @Cassand04738873 @RepMarkMeadows Mexico is not funding the border wall, that is a fact. The Wall is not being built, research before you tweet, it makes you look stupid. Old wall is being repaired. No "new" wall - rinse &amp; repeat.
@eveinthesky @Cassand04738873 @RepMarkMeadows You're right. No dispute about the repeal being blocked by Dems, (but you need to add some more tin foil to your hat) Deep State-Qanon foolishness. Decent human beings want to help the the sick &amp; preserve life over $ and debt. Remove Christian from your profile, hypocrite.

@pac_o_licious @Airvooocht @realDonaldTrump @TuckerCarlson You are absolutely incorrect. It is because of numbers, look it up for yourself. Do you have any background in sociology? Look up culture because your using it wrong. Your confusing BEHAVIOR vs. CULTURE, they are not the same thing.
@pac_o_licious @Airvooocht @realDonaldTrump @TuckerCarlson 6. Unfortunately, modern society has to create more laws forcing us to be kind to one another, b/c we don't do it ourselves.
@pac_o_licious @Airvooocht @realDonaldTrump @TuckerCarlson 5. For me, obvoiusIy, I know laws effect others adversely , but I never spoke to someone who was actually effected. I agree these "supposed" fixes have flaws &amp; they cannot be perpetuitous.
@pac_o_licious @Airvooocht @realDonaldTrump @TuckerCarlson 4. So far, you understand the 3 factors that always divide, which is miles from where you started &amp; that the apparatuses you object to, are bipartisan and/or legal machinations.This is going better than I thought.
@pac_o_licious @Airvooocht @realDonaldTrump @TuckerCarlson 3. Like I said, it's acceptable for us to be hypocrites, just not the law.
@pac_o_licious @Airvooocht @realDonaldTrump @TuckerCarlson 2. The highest courts have repeatedly determined that Indigenous, African &amp; Japanese Americans, &amp; European Jews deserve reparations and/or restitution for harm &amp; damage, prevention of future abuses &amp; better chances for progress that mostly all the systems denied them.
@pac_o_licious @Airvooocht @realDonaldTrump @TuckerCarlson 1. Fantastic!! Atleast that's an acknowledgment of two things. First to see your realization of these decisions being judicial &amp; legal ones, and not some "left" agenda as you proposed. 2ndly, that you nor I are the qualified legal minds to make those determinations.
@pac_o_licious @Airvooocht @realDonaldTrump @TuckerCarlson 3. The poor man can steal to survive.	 Correct?
@pac_o_licious @Airvooocht @realDonaldTrump @TuckerCarlson 2. The fallacy is that the poor man can help himself without help. Somehow, Brian, you have convinced yourself that it can be done w/out help, the paradox is that the poor man thinks he can't do it without help. Neither is wrong or correct. The best way I can explain is this:
@pac_o_licious @Airvooocht @realDonaldTrump @TuckerCarlson 1. Once again hypothetical ques. on scenarios like that are moot, it deserves no intelligent response b/c the solution is not allowed. Not only one change in our politics &amp; priorities could correct it, but a change in what we value &amp; altering the many systems to accommodate it.

@pac_o_licious @Airvooocht @realDonaldTrump @TuckerCarlson 6. Just so it's clear, the capitalist system is fine, free market and all that. The poorest American is not close to being the poorest human on earth. What I'm conveying is EQUAL OPPORTUNITY and it is a constant fight to maintain for all people.
@joncoopertweets Ohio needs to be watched at all times by all the voting fraud agencies, it is gerrymandered to death.	Frank LaRose is the Secretary of State.
@pac_o_licious @Airvooocht @realDonaldTrump @TuckerCarlson 5. It surely is appreciated by those creating eternal, generational wealth, while Ohio, Michigan, &amp;  the South pray there's not another recession in the next 20 years...and by the way there will be. Buckle up, we'll be at retirement age by then.
@pac_o_licious @Airvooocht @realDonaldTrump @TuckerCarlson 4. Someone once tweeted this to me:	I'm on their side for "equality" not for advancement because of past wrongs.		When I read it, I thought how ironic when ppl. attribute simplified phrases to complex views, but do they apply them to all things. If this is your principle?
@pac_o_licious @Airvooocht @realDonaldTrump @TuckerCarlson 3. ...to something that will never be paid off and she didn't cause. Is that equal distribution? How is she to advance amongst the debt created 6 generations before her birth.
@pac_o_licious @Airvooocht @realDonaldTrump @TuckerCarlson 2.Your great, great granddaughter will be paying off only the interest of a 19 TRILLION deficit. If she doesn't become apart of the 5%  (approx. 1million a year) she will grind out a living until she is 100 yrs old, paying 8-24% of her income...
@pac_o_licious @Airvooocht @realDonaldTrump @TuckerCarlson 1. Yes, there are rich &amp; poor of all races, freedom allows for opportunity, I have lived in many free countries, but in the U.S. the richest 1% hold 40%  of the wealth, while the bottom 90% of ppl. hold 73.2 of all debt.
@pac_o_licious @Airvooocht @realDonaldTrump @TuckerCarlson A lot of what you purposing is so hypothetical hyperbole, I don't know if there's an intelligent response. First, your confusing equal rights vs. income equality. Also, It sounds like you've never been out of America from some of the comments you're making, so it comes off naive.
@pac_o_licious @Airvooocht @realDonaldTrump @TuckerCarlson Maybe you don't understand what I was referring, too? 	I'm not sure what your attempting to convey, you made broad &amp; blanket statements or did you combine sentiments from separate threads?...we didn't even talk about "choices" nor should we go down that rabbit hole.
@pac_o_licious @Airvooocht @realDonaldTrump @TuckerCarlson 5. Of course, If you need help or have questions you can ask, sometimes ppl. feel they can't talk about these things...which means no one empathizes.
@pac_o_licious @Airvooocht @realDonaldTrump @TuckerCarlson 4. Since you've read Jason Riley. Y'know, there were other ideas on the table to make things equal that could have been victimless &amp; they were rejected by the Right &amp; Left, there is more to the story than from our conversations, I believe you are familiar with &amp; need to know.
@pac_o_licious @Airvooocht @realDonaldTrump @TuckerCarlson 3. However, the rule of law should be exempt from that shallow emotion, "better than that." Hopefully, your brilliant daughter is learning that right now. That's really all I have to say about that, but I will add this for you to research on your own.
@pac_o_licious @Airvooocht @realDonaldTrump @TuckerCarlson 2. The idea that its "unfair" now for a demographic that benefited from it for decades. Is hypocritical. Which is ok. We're all hypocrites on certain levels. It doesn't make you the absolute worse person.
@pac_o_licious @Airvooocht @realDonaldTrump @TuckerCarlson 1. I don't think a world exist where everything is fair. It's not a intelligent argument. Arguably, these are ppl.who we have chosen to lead us, that are smarter than us, atleast on legal matters to make systems that were unjust for centuries equal for everybody going forward.
@pac_o_licious @Airvooocht @realDonaldTrump @TuckerCarlson 2. Congratulations, your daughter showed great character, (hopefully she'll be be a civil rights atty😂) but I would understand you &amp; her being upset about an unfair system....just like the students grandparents were upset all those years ago.
@pac_o_licious @Airvooocht @realDonaldTrump @TuckerCarlson 1. Yes, they got it. 25 years later, all the way up to the Supreme Court. They finally won. It was your daughter losing that lottery. See, how your on their side, until it affected you.	It is not fair, but the gov't was not fair, right?  Btw, A "no" would be hypocrisy.
@pac_o_licious @Airvooocht @realDonaldTrump @TuckerCarlson 2. Obviously I have opinions, but Latinos, Asians, Muslims are a growing population and will feel the need for represention in their communities, state &amp; country.	The U.S. experiment will continue to evolve until it fails. All Empires fall, Brian. This one will be no different.
@pac_o_licious @Airvooocht @realDonaldTrump @TuckerCarlson 1. If its too personal, don't answer but what year were you born &amp; was it in America? Some questions seem basic knowledge to me, not being rude, but I need help on how much I need to explain. We know how it happen, but your second question I debate w/myself all the time. ???
@pac_o_licious @Airvooocht @realDonaldTrump @TuckerCarlson 3.We would be on different levels to discuss cultures from the outside looking in, but Alas &amp; Amen!! Those last 3 words. Remember what I said about class = education &amp; wealth, also being divisive &amp; it doesn't have to be about RACE.	I think your understanding which is great!
@pac_o_licious @Airvooocht @realDonaldTrump @TuckerCarlson 2. I don't entirely disagree w/ your statement, the things you listed are the repercussions, not the causality, but clarify b/c your making blanket statements, that have origins either you do not know of or don't believe are true amongst the evidence.
@pac_o_licious @Airvooocht @realDonaldTrump @TuckerCarlson 1. You beleive, but "Opinion" is not calculable, is it? If that is your stance, what am I suppose to do? Acknowledge it? Do you believe the Earth is flat? It would be tedious for me to speak reality, while you talk perception.
@pac_o_licious @Airvooocht @realDonaldTrump @TuckerCarlson I do data analytics, I've spent some years looking at these annual reports, there fun if your a nerd...	https://t.co/oVGNL3jiaM		https://t.co/CN2r5h477J
https://t.co/pAAlGzHaWN
@pac_o_licious @Airvooocht @realDonaldTrump @TuckerCarlson I've lived all over the world, Brian. Look up any country &amp; see how they do things, but keep in mind, no one is doing this failed experiment we're trying. Start w/ Canada, UK the most similar. Australia, though I've never been. Israel, Sweden, Japan, maybe Germany(very different)
@pac_o_licious @Airvooocht @realDonaldTrump @TuckerCarlson 4. You can also do women, just in case you have questions about their discrimination in U.S. society and they're not even a minority in the population...but that goes back to my primal point, that the country is divided at it's core.
@pac_o_licious @Airvooocht @realDonaldTrump @TuckerCarlson 3.  ...continue w/ judges, CEO's, bankers, hedge fund managers, generals in all branches, first minority police commissioners, attorney generals, district attorney's, college dean's. Stop there. Document the disparity of minorities. I have done this, it is educational.
@pac_o_licious @Airvooocht @realDonaldTrump @TuckerCarlson 2. None, no laws. There is no longer a reason for laws, once something becomes systemic. I'll give you an easy one...Do you like sports? Look up the # of minority head coaches, GM's in each sport &amp; the years they were hired. 	Do the same w/ mayors, governors, legislatures....
@pac_o_licious @Airvooocht @realDonaldTrump @TuckerCarlson 1. Great questions, maybe too many.😦	I'm not sure if I can do it on 300 char. Twitter, today. Let's use this as our new thread and I'll answer each one, but this is a lenghty topic. I'll briefly start on the first one:
@pac_o_licious @Airvooocht @realDonaldTrump @TuckerCarlson C. Where is your anger for them, then? 	"Well, crap, me &amp; my kid weren't even born," you might correctly say. 	But ,if you were, would you care? What should her grandparents do at that point or what would you do?
@pac_o_licious @Airvooocht @realDonaldTrump @TuckerCarlson B. The system to fix inequality is an imperfect one, to be sure. How do you fix it? You &amp; I could probably think of better ideas, but I digress. 	If I asked you to consider in 1970 that same girls grandparents were overqualified &amp; denied entry into that very same college.
@pac_o_licious @Airvooocht @realDonaldTrump @TuckerCarlson A. I put this in a separate thread, b/c your kids case deserves attention outside of our overall discussion. Your situation though anecdotal &amp; isolated from my experiences w/ higher ed...It did happen to her &amp; that sucks, if like most states it was done by lottery.
@pac_o_licious @Airvooocht @realDonaldTrump @TuckerCarlson 2 of 2. We live in a technological age, 1 of my 3 degrees was online. All my kids are in school. Perhaps its different in your State.
@pac_o_licious @Airvooocht @realDonaldTrump @TuckerCarlson 1 of 2. We agree on education for the most part, although what are your sources? The breakdown about not enough schools or classes &amp; tuition increased b/c of supply/demand seem to be omitting other factors and whatever the case are surely fixable.
@pac_o_licious @Airvooocht @realDonaldTrump @TuckerCarlson Culture "HIGHLY" effects ones ability to advance along with influence. So many people are naive enough to believe everything they are told.	A: True. That's one of the factors for all ppl. I'm not clear on what this means or the point.
@pac_o_licious @Airvooocht @realDonaldTrump @TuckerCarlson I met Mr. Riley, once and have read 3 of his books. He makes great and undeniable points, none that refute what I've said that I can remember. I will email him.
@pac_o_licious @Airvooocht @realDonaldTrump @TuckerCarlson J. We need to start taking pages from countries that are beating us and adopt some of their successful practices.
@pac_o_licious @Airvooocht @realDonaldTrump @TuckerCarlson I. I don't like comparing America to other Western countries, we are conducting history's greatest experiment, multiple cultures, faiths &amp; races living under democratic rule of law. It is impossible, espec. being far too empirical, arrogant, &amp; hyper violent.
@pac_o_licious @Airvooocht @realDonaldTrump @TuckerCarlson H. If you &amp; we are sincere about helping young minorities &amp; the poor, we have to stop college tuition increasing every yr., 60k+ a yr. is a debtors prison, where smart kids can't go b/c they can't afford it, expand tuition for military service, &amp; free vocational education.
@pac_o_licious @Airvooocht @realDonaldTrump @TuckerCarlson G. American people could have fixed this thru healthcare, w/ little gov't interference, but we allowed fear &amp; overwhelment to have us believe we needed bigger gov't &amp; more laws. To let us give into the gov't (DEA, DOJ, etc.) and you know the rest.
@pac_o_licious @Airvooocht @realDonaldTrump @TuckerCarlson F. 2nd and most important, the previous generation (you &amp; me &amp; us) did little to change many systems that we as citizens controlled, but gave away to bureaucracy. For one example, the Drug War, a miserable bi-partisan, unilateral failure by all accounts.
@pac_o_licious @Airvooocht @realDonaldTrump @TuckerCarlson E. (That is rhetorical, just to prove the point of how insulting that sounds)
@pac_o_licious @Airvooocht @realDonaldTrump @TuckerCarlson D. Your thought on what young minority culture needs to do to advance is insulting. First, b/c your premise, I doubt is even true, but if it is, how does it keep them from advancing? Did pushing racism on white youth from 1600-1969 prevent their societal advancement?
@pac_o_licious @Airvooocht @realDonaldTrump @TuckerCarlson C. Racism will never be resolved...w/out a severe change in politics, (what and how our society determines what it values as important.)	Ideally, The gov't can only do what the citizens tolerate, anyway.
@pac_o_licious @Airvooocht @realDonaldTrump @TuckerCarlson B. I'll tell you this, MSM actually under reports racial tension, if we read every local newspaper, police report &amp; lawsuit filed everyday for a year, you would immediately realize, this is an issue that will never be resolved.
@pac_o_licious @Airvooocht @realDonaldTrump @TuckerCarlson A. Opinion or what has happen to you or what you have seen.(the eye test) is no legitimate way to determine actual fact.  	I replied w/ a link to an article, I could reply w/ dozens of statistics, but that's not really are points.
@pac_o_licious @Airvooocht @realDonaldTrump @TuckerCarlson African Americans are 13% of the population but are 47% of 1,900 exonerations listed in 2016 Nat'l Registry of Exonerations -- a reminder that race infects every stage of our criminal justice system		Read about Huwe Burton, wrongly convicted at 16.	https://t.co/8AfluShozP

@pac_o_licious @Airvooocht @realDonaldTrump @TuckerCarlson 12. Thanks for the dialogue and once again not wanting to offend your opinions, just clearly understand them.
@pac_o_licious @Airvooocht @realDonaldTrump @TuckerCarlson 11.I hope you will do the same and prove any examples you can find of American systemic bigotries being non-existent or being fostered by only the left and not the right as well. No rush, I would prefer data over opinion.
@pac_o_licious @Airvooocht @realDonaldTrump @TuckerCarlson 10. You say your an accepting person, there are those no matter what the politics that are not. I wouldn't imply that was you, if its not. Sorry. I am still interested in a counter, I hope I have shown a level on this topic that is not rhetoric, but things that you can research.
@pac_o_licious @Airvooocht @realDonaldTrump @TuckerCarlson 9. Obama/Trump, Left/Right are syptoms of the disease &amp; their supporters are manifestations of divisive politics...not ideas, but politics. You can only exploit fear/hate, when it's already present, openly or hidden. That's what I meant by small minds.
@pac_o_licious @Airvooocht @realDonaldTrump @TuckerCarlson 8. These are varied &amp; nuanced subjects, that if someone is naive about, they shouldn't try to speak on. Not you, personally...ANYONE. From what you have already said, you think this is created by a left wing &amp; media attacks and for me, who has studied, that is myopic w/out proof.
@pac_o_licious @Airvooocht @realDonaldTrump @TuckerCarlson 7. I said America has always been divided by these 3 factors. It is inherent in its nature, from its inception and built into its foundations. This is what is meant by history. I'm unable to explain it on Twitter any better than that...anyone has to invest time into the research.
@pac_o_licious @Airvooocht @realDonaldTrump @TuckerCarlson 6. For thousands of years to this day, the world has also governed by race &amp; religion. (S. Africa, Iran, Israel Vatican,etc.) As well, America is made up of several schisms of Western Christianity. It's "Laws, rules &amp; ethics" are/were based on those beliefs, not by the left.
@pac_o_licious @Airvooocht @realDonaldTrump @TuckerCarlson 5. (You don't believe? Google social disparity of any of these factors, research websites &amp; read the data. It does take a willingness to acquire knowledge.(not an insult) There's societal differences between ppl. educated &amp; not educated. Let's not debate the value of learning.
@pac_o_licious @Airvooocht @realDonaldTrump @TuckerCarlson 4.People of diff. ethnicities &amp; women in all societies,  incl. the U.S. being restricted of the same access as those in power. Education, housing, employment, health, income, social status all at times judged by these factors.That is class warfare.
@pac_o_licious @Airvooocht @realDonaldTrump @TuckerCarlson 2. Words can sound harsh on Twitter than what their meant, I apologize, Brian. These are not personal attacks, I would like to understand your thought process, please. It appears absolutely alien to me. Let's say we never agree, but atleast we empathize. That could be progress.
@pac_o_licious @Airvooocht @realDonaldTrump @TuckerCarlson 3. My world view: Before America, Leftism, television, social media, existed. The world has governed by class= heredity, wealth, education, territory, gender.
@pac_o_licious @Airvooocht @realDonaldTrump @TuckerCarlson 1. Ok, start over. (no insults) Although, some were referencing your point of view and not you per se. I'm also able to choose my words better &amp; will try to do so. Admittingly, this may be useless. That was always my point. What regrettably, happened to your child is my point.
@pac_o_licious @Airvooocht @realDonaldTrump @TuckerCarlson 5.  In 2019 there's no excuse to be ignorant, information is free, if you read more or/and go to school to get some degrees. Then get back on Twitter, you'll do better. How's that for an emotional tirade?😂😂rhetorical.
@pac_o_licious @Airvooocht @realDonaldTrump @TuckerCarlson 4. If you believe that racial, religious, gender, &amp; wealth are not the factors in the inequalities of society &amp; gov't &amp; only discrimination &amp; prejudice comes from the left, that is dumb as a bag of rocks.
@pac_o_licious @Airvooocht @realDonaldTrump @TuckerCarlson 3. I like facts and your views are like a case study in how low informed so many people are, how education has failed so many Trumpsters today, in how in desperation you have put a faith in a man who has cheated and lied in every aspect of his life. Now that's funny!! 😂😂😁😅
@pac_o_licious @Airvooocht @realDonaldTrump @TuckerCarlson 2. I don't think from your words, you can understand those principles. I'll teach you another term, "ad hominem", you have given 0 facts to support one iota a of your point in 2 days, opposed to all of American history to prove mine, but you call me hurt? Your bad at debating.
@pac_o_licious @Airvooocht @realDonaldTrump @TuckerCarlson 1. Sadly you're just repeating yourself now &amp; what your doing is what's known as "projecting." You believe in a party, but I don't prescribe to right or left, that's for small minds. There is a gov't for all people by all the people...
@pac_o_licious @Airvooocht @realDonaldTrump @TuckerCarlson Like I said, divided...remember....or did you already forget what the topic was. Twitter may not be the platform for you, it requires an ability to express thoughts thru words.

@markm126 @Alyssa_Milano @TalkPoverty Don't take my word for it! Google it, takes 3 minutes.
@markm126 @Alyssa_Milano @TalkPoverty I'm not an Obama admin. fan &amp; Pelosi "immoral" &amp; AOC "facts" were stupid for sure, but I'll have no choice but to assume you are too, if you want to compare the 5000 verified lies, plus the utterly incomprehensible statements Don has made as POTUS.
@markm126 @Alyssa_Milano @TalkPoverty Lol, You have really fallen for history's greatest con artist. I already knew the answer but I checked anyways. Trumps approval ratings are historically bad, only high w/ R's. &amp; his bad press is deserved..but both of those points are subjective. So we can go back to facts, Lol!!
RT @EmilyGorcenski: I’m a Lead Data Scientist for a major international consultancy. I have a degree in computational mathematics. I have 1…
@pac_o_licious @Airvooocht @realDonaldTrump @TuckerCarlson That's delusional thinking from a sick, disturbed and/or uneducated mind with no fact or logic to justify it. To make that ignorant statement you must have no historical memory, failed reading comprehension &amp; void of all societal context. Out of the 3, why'd you fixate on race?
@markm126 @Alyssa_Milano @TalkPoverty 8. I'm going to forget all the rhetoric, data, stats, etc. we could go all day.	It should be obvious to you, even as a fan, your team has put themselves into an impossible corner. He hasn't convinced enough Americans that it's needed or the wall should cost $5.7B. Plain &amp; Simple.
@markm126 @Alyssa_Milano @TalkPoverty 7. Don can declare his " National Emergency" &amp; prove it in court or stop the shutdown to talk. Personally, the focus should be on overstayed visas and penalties for those who hire illegals; Problem solved...but neither party wants that. You should ask why?
@markm126 @Alyssa_Milano @TalkPoverty 6. Obviuosly, the Dems are blocking, it would be disingenuous to say they're not. Americans cannot be held hostage into giving the gov't money, w/out legislation, the precedent it sets is dangerous. No democratic legislation = Socialism...
@markm126 @Alyssa_Milano @TalkPoverty 6. Obviuosly, the Dems are blocking, it would be disingenuous to say they're not. But Americans cannot be held hostage into giving the gov't money, it is Socialism w/ out democratic legislation. Don can declare his "emergency" and prove it in court or stop the shutdown to talk.
@markm126 @Alyssa_Milano @TalkPoverty 5. I remember the altercation, clearly. Trump said he needed only 10 Dem votes...he didn't get them! That's how it works! If they couldn't get it done in 2017- 18 what makes them think they could have got the $ after being trounced in the midterms, losing the House &amp; Speaker.
@markm126 @Alyssa_Milano @TalkPoverty 4. I do know. What you're failing to comprehend is that's OUR system. For 2 yrs, the R's had the majority &amp; never put up 1 bill for a wall, but WASTED time w/ deals to repeal/replace ACA , a tax cut, tariffs &amp; travel bans. They screwed up their priorities and lost the House.
@RepGosar $5.7B for 235 miles of "new" wall. What about the 1k mi. of wide open border left? That's $24 million per mile = $24.5K for every 5 feet of wall. Shouldn't steel slats be cheaper? Why is $1.5B not enough? What are Republicans doing about overstayed visas? Are you lying to us?
@Dem4now @Santucci @maggieNYT Speech #1. All lies.	Speech #2. Not (sniff) the (sniff) truth.
@LisaTalbot11 @Airvooocht @realDonaldTrump @TuckerCarlson 2. I won't call that racist, b/c that requires purposeful thought, what you said was just dumb.
@LisaTalbot11 @Airvooocht @realDonaldTrump @TuckerCarlson 1. That's delusional thinking from a sick disturbed and/ or uneducated mind with no fact or logic to justify it. To make that ignorant statement you must have no historical memory, failed reading comprehension and void of societal context.

@BrownSalamander @abarnet1 @cilla05 @_waleedshahid @shaunking @KamalaHarris 👍
@BrownSalamander @abarnet1 @cilla05 @_waleedshahid @shaunking The world is full of awful (old &amp; new) regimes...No doubt!! The legacy of the U.S. backing them is a curse &amp; will be unsustainable, benefiting only a few, over the rest of us. Truthfully, Bernie cannot stop America's empirical nature, it's grossly systemic...so still vote to win.
@abarnet1 @cilla05 @_waleedshahid @shaunking @KamalaHarris I know many Bernie or nothing voters, so I predict a huge turnout will be needed...maybe bigger than the midterms, if possible or Corp. Dems can co-op his platform, but can you trust them? It's scary times, for sure.
@abarnet1 @cilla05 @_waleedshahid @shaunking @KamalaHarris I don't entirely disagree, I would just put it in this fair context: If he runs, Bernie's platform is and will be like no other Dem, so essentially there can be no compromise...but the obvious goal of getting rid of Satan (not literally...well maybe) is vital.
@TSBsLTR @Derbygurl11 @Alyssa_Milano @TalkPoverty Anyone who argues against, instead of defending SNAP is low informed or stupid, there is no debate. There is more taxpayer theft in the military, law enforcement, all 3 branches of gov't &amp; corporations each, than in the entire history of food stamps.
@markm126 @Alyssa_Milano @TalkPoverty 3. Equating Pelosi/Schumer role in the shutdown to that of Donald's is neither logical or factual. We have a system in place, you submit a bill and it passes or it doesn't, were not circumventing the legislature for anything or anyone. Done.
@markm126 @Alyssa_Milano @TalkPoverty 2. The fact that one senator #WheresMitch can block a bill coming to the floor, shows how broken the system is &amp; how they don't have enough votes in their own party to get it passed. So like w/ everything in his life, Donald wants to lie &amp; cheat, while simpletons cheer him on.
@markm126 @Alyssa_Milano @TalkPoverty 1. House passed 6 bills to reopen gov't. Senate passed 0. Current bill proposes that the MF gets 100% of what he wants &amp; gives the Democrats nothing they've asked for. You can't trust Trump, he's a habitual liar, a two bit con-man &amp; we don't negotiate w/ hostage takers, ever.
@TSBsLTR @Derbygurl11 @Alyssa_Milano @TalkPoverty 41 mill. Amer. receiving an avg. of  $130 a month. That's 12.5% of U.S., in which more than 3/4 are children, seniors, disabled, or working. U.S. throws away 100 mill. meals each day. Simple math = No one in America should go hungry.  https://t.co/zCpyvJPcSB
@TSBsLTR @Derbygurl11 @Alyssa_Milano @TalkPoverty MS ranks in the top 3 poorest states in America for about 5 decades and gets a ton of fed $ for being poor. (still votes red?)
@TSBsLTR @Derbygurl11 @Alyssa_Milano @TalkPoverty Your giving facts to Rubes. You might as well be talking to a border wall.
@abarnet1 @cilla05 @_waleedshahid @shaunking @KamalaHarris This shouldn't be a surprise or a deal breaker for most Progressives, but it's good to know her stances very early, the DEM choices will be so many this time around, you almost have to nitpick. Sander supporters have no reason to sabotage candidates, they won't have his views.
@_waleedshahid Yikes!!!!
@JLWNEO @SenSherrodBrown Only a Two Party system...One that hates the dream...One that manipulates it. Neither commiting to any of the words he espoused...I guess it will forever be a dream.
@gooderish @damocrat @AOC Thanks again for your time. It's a big day here...The games tonight, decide who goes to the Superbowl (Amer. Football)😁 It doesn't sound like your against many of AOC's ideas. We didn't talk about Climate Change, but we'll save that for next time or leave it to France. Cheers.
@gooderish @damocrat @AOC Oh, I see what your saying, it's only dangerous when convenient...that has to be a small %, right?  Freak out moment 😄
@gooderish @damocrat @AOC Thanks for your time BTW, 3 more quest. Were you able to find work for what went to school for? Was it enough to pay your loans? We have a problem with that here. Obviuosly, UK &amp; USA being the police of the world brings on some added expense, would you like to see that continue?
@gooderish @damocrat @AOC Haha!! FOM means something different here!! I don't agree w/ FGM, but I don't think that makes them undesirable, it sounds like these are legal or asylum immigrants, so I will say we probably disagree on that aspect.
@gooderish @damocrat @AOC Absolutely, a big difference. Our college Is very expensive, too. We have over a $trillion in debt, that financial bubble will pop in about 10 yrs...and America is done. Is the influx in immigration due to the decades of war against Iraq, Syria, Libiya Afghanistan?
@realGIJoe007 @felicia403 @agresr @AOC I figured that was your answer. I knew I would regret asking b/c there was never a doubt. Are all of you rubes?
@gooderish @damocrat @AOC Correct me if I'm wrong, you fixated on immigration and I understand your concern, but did you go to University where the gov't helped you pay?
@gooderish @damocrat @AOC You want to get rid of the healthcare system in the UK? Will people go into debt, when their sick?
@gooderish @damocrat @AOC Twitter is were she shines, no doubt, but she moves the needle on all social media platforms in the U.S. The right wing MSM fear her, the bigots obviously hate her, but they talk about her daily, troll her account &amp; she bashes them RATM (first album) style. It’s hysterical!!
@AndrazJeric 😁So strange...the things stupid people are scared of.
@AndrazJeric He was in John Wick 2, as well. Matrix reunion.
@realGIJoe007 @felicia403 @agresr @AOC Where is she from? Common sense, understanding you can identify w/ being from anywhere you were a resident. When I'm in France, I tell people I'm from the state I live in, not from were I was born or where I lived while in college, although I could...it's where you call home.
@damocrat @AOC Is there a young politician there, that scares the crap out of the old farts or the conservatives in Parliament?... just curious.
@JimmyXJames Your tin foil hat...needs more tin foil.
@JimmyXJames This is a PERFECT example of the #DeplorableRubes who are still proud they voted for TRUMP!
@Astralfury @damocrat I recommend a "follow" especially right now, if only just for laughs. The U.S. gov't is dung beetle shit, right now. If it wasn't for #TheNotoriousAOC it would be intolerable.

@Swinehunter @RealJamesWoods Do you expect there to be 100% stoppage of illegal immigrants from only 235 miles of new wall w/ over a 1K miles still left open? Does $24M per mile seem a fair cost for steel slats?	Do you not recognize arrests as the BPD succeeding? We'll still need them even w/ a wall. Agreed?

@d2386n @skullaria @ScottAdamsSays I don't believe there will ever be 0% illegal immigration, so the law of the census counting everyone incl. illegals is antiquated, it was put in the Constitution, when this problem couldn't have been conceived of. It should be adjusted.
@d2386n @skullaria @ScottAdamsSays That's why getting rid of gerrymandering when they have the majority, is vital for election integrity &amp; deporting those w/ overstayed visas(the majority of illegals in the U.S.) Penalize employers who hire undoc. workers. (No jobs, they won't come) &amp; stop fed. $ to those states.
@Newburydave Amen.
@Newburydave Correct.Those are for local elections.
@skullaria @d2386n @ScottAdamsSays Yes, Your referring to the electoral college in the Presidential elections.	 I agree that could present a problem in the future, but as of yet has had absolutely no bearing on an election to date. That process may have to be adjusted.
@d2386n @ScottAdamsSays The few places that allow it, are within the context of local &amp;  school board elections where immigrant pop. is high w/ children. Not state or federal, so Senate/Congress/POTUS have no vested interest in what your implying.
@TheGeekHoard @ScottAdamsSays It is a game, for sure.
@ScottAdamsSays 2. We've seen steel can be cut, tunnels built, &amp; drugs coming thru entry points &amp; still arrests are at 45 yr. lows w/ great BPD work!!	$5.7B could go elsewhere, $1.5B plus the $ that hasn't been spent from this years budget is enough.	Improve on what's already working.
@ScottAdamsSays 1. Most illegals are overstayed visas.	$5.7B for 235 mi. of "NEW" wall on the border &amp; leaving the rest wide open?	That's $24M per mi. = $25k per 5 ft. of wall!  Walls in the 🌎, that are equivalent, are militarized &amp; mainly, barbed wire. Costs were under $5B, others were $12B+
@ScottAdamsSays This was really cute nonsense, like Dilbert.	This "solution" can be done w/ the gov't running. Mitch won't call for the vote cause the R's don't have the #'s. The POTUS shutting down gov't to extort my money can not be allowed &amp; must be fought. $1.5B additional funding is enough.
@mskochin @ScottAdamsSays I don't think you thought this joke out. It contradicts: If there's no barrier, how do they get caught to see the judge, to get released?

@RealJamesWoods How much of this $84B guesstimate, can be attributed to the S. border? Most illegals are from overstayed visas, others come in by boat and plane.	It appears $5.7B should be going elsewhere within border security.
@RealJamesWoods $5.7B for 235 mi. of "NEW" wall? Leaving poss. 75 - 85%  open for years. Realistically, its more a $30B price tag. We've seen the steel can be cut, tunnels built, most drugs coming from entry points. 		Arrests are at 45 yr. lows w/ great BPD work! Increase what's already working.
@RealJamesWoods Seems pricey for 235 mi. of "NEW" wall out of 1700 mi. of wide open border? That's $24M per mi. = $24.5K for every 5 ft. of wall. Barriers around the 🌎, that are equivalent, are militarized/war zones &amp; mainly, barbed wire. The costs are far less of $5B, others can be over $12B.

@realDonaldTrump Poured down the drain?....national debt increased by 2+ Trillion since you criminally, conned your way to the job you're completely unqualified &amp; mentally incapable of doing in a manner to serve America.
@realDonaldTrump I'll contribute $1, but I want it back, if the Wall is not built. I want $5, if Mexico pays for it, later b/c that $1 was a just a loan. The wall needs yearly maint., I will send $50 for it's up-keep. Annually, I will climb &amp; piss off it "Tyrion" style   https://t.co/idgBx5oplA

The majority oppose Trump’s wall. They don’t think it makes any sense or think it would make us any more secure and they don’t understand why he is asking US taxpayers to pay for it after promising, again and again, that Mexico would pay for it.

@peddler54 @MMViverito @Ocasio2018 I mentioned the EU, because the tweet had (Europe) along with China/ India...as if lumping Europe in this narrative is the same. Maybe the twit/tweeter? thought Europe was somehow unified in this way. I was attempting to clarify, that they are not, in anyway.

@peddler54 @MMViverito @Ocasio2018 All this is archived on govt websites and can be found on multiple search engines, type in Paris Climate Agreement.
@peddler54 @MMViverito @Ocasio2018 The W. Post has covered this "Theory" repeatedly for some years. The PCA, Obama's exec. order &amp; Trump's withdrawal, ratification, treaties, etc are complex.These observations are culled from an ogoing academic look at the provisions of the agreement.
@peddler54 @MMViverito @Ocasio2018 😂😂 First, I know you were just tweeting someone else's nonsense/chart from Link...so no worries. You may learn/believe more by doing your own research, instead of from tweets. The internet is more than social media and porn. 😁
@targator73 @BenSasse @BenSasse Why you're giving out opinions, what's your take on a 1st term guy, who takes PAC $, supports Big oil &amp; NRA, is against gay marriage, equal pay, ACA, claims to not trust Trump, but votes MAGA 86+%, Votes to increase his pay,but "NO" on min. Wage increases? Is he lonely?
@drjmftspeaks Is it ok with you? I want to send this tweet to some Senators and Reps who aren't seeing the big picture.
@peddler54 @MMViverito @Ocasio2018 Also, Europe is a continent, not a country. The EU is a Financial &amp; Trade partnership, not environmental policymaking.
@ComShrewbies @katherinemiller "Escalation of commitment" is a human behavior pattern in which an individual or group facing increasingly negative outcomes from some decision, action, or investment nevertheless continues the same behavior rather than alter course.
@peddler54 @MMViverito @Ocasio2018 Also, China &amp; India are in the middle of their Industrial Revolution' similar to the US/Europe in the 1800's, hypocritical to ask them to suddenly stop the advancement of their society, when the West did no to stop massively polluting for a century.
@peddler54 @MMViverito @Ocasio2018 Facts: Sept 3, 2016 Obama signs PCA.	June 2017 Trump withdraws from PCA which doesn't take effect until early 2020. Anyone w/ a brain can verify this in about 3 minutes on the web. So this tweet is as good as used toilet paper.

@jguil4d @rivardruns @imjoegood @Grace4NY @Ocasio2018 American participation in it's own system of government is low for a developed country, including voting. If turnout ever increases to a consistent 70% or above, a day off may be mandatory.
@jguil4d @rivardruns @imjoegood @Grace4NY @Ocasio2018 The proposal is to make it a "National" Holiday. Specifically replacing Columbus Day. Millions of Fed. employees would be off to presumably vote that day, but you are correct, the rest of us would work, since no US law requires employers to give you the day off. #restoretheVRA
