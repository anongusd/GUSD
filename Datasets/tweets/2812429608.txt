Assembly overwhelmingly passes AB 1711 to limit University of California nonresident enrollment to 10% by 2022-23 following state audit.
Bill that would have imposed stricter rules on the release of police body camera footage fails to pass on first Assembly vote.
AB 2261 that strengthens CA Labor Commissioner authority to investigate employers squeaks out of the Assembly on a 41-30 vote.
