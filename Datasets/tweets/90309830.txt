More on the trend of candidates rejecting corporate PAC money - https://t.co/oUG8HtaIA8
@Odysseus93 @SenGillibrand @CoryBooker @MoveToAmend Absolutely it needs to become systemic &amp; permanent! That's why, in addition to an amendment, we support forms of public financing for campaigns like the Government By the People Act.
Matching small donations, or giving all residents vouchers for political donations (like they do in Seattle) doesn't just limit the power of big money but also brings many new people into the political process. We can ensure everyone's voice is heard!
But it's not just enough to rely on candidates to self-regulate &amp; hope they do the right thing. Let's put systems in place that would allow ALL candidates to break their big money habits -- systems like the Government By The People Act! @OfByUs
Even potential presidential candidates like @SenGillibrand and @CoryBooker are refusing corporate PAC money -- an encouraging sign that we can break our dependence on corporate and special interest money.

Every tenant of Trump's - foreign or not - poses a conflict of interest to the president. The president is supposed to work for the people, not bestow favors on the people and companies that pay him. Trump must divest from all his real estate holdings.
One tenant, Wallgreens Boots Alliance, is paying $3.2M/annually directly to Trump. When the company sought federal sign off on a merger from the Trump admin, it got it.
At least 36 of Trump's tenants have meaningful relationships with the federal government, from contractors to lobbying firms to regulatory targets.

If you are sick &amp; tired of being in this position of fighting against a bill that is for big donors, not voters, be sure to also ask your reps to sign on to the Gov't By The People Act next time you call.
Small-donor matching &amp; voucher systems totally change the balance of power so that people with $5 are heard as loudly as people with $5 million
BUT - as so many of you understand in your gut - we also have to address the big money system that got us here. Until we change who pays for campaigns, there will always be a harmful bill politicians are trying to pass for their donors, at our expense.
Keep calling your senators, and keep writing letters to the editor! We deserve a tax bill that works for all of us, not just wealthy donors.

When you're calling your members to say no to this regressive tax bill (and you ARE calling, right?), also ask that they support the Government By The People Act.
Unfortunately, this is just one very clear example of how accountability fails in a big-money political system. If we never want to find ourselves back in this position, we have to change how we fund campaigns.
So Rs face a choice: accountability to voters, or their biggest donors?
Of course, cutting taxes on billionaire donors while raising taxes on low- and middle-income families is poison with their actual voters. https://t.co/FCfmCZJwR8

Pssst - GOP, if you want to get out of this damaging cycle of passing legislation solely to appease very rich donors, even if it endangers your career, start by passing the Gov't By The People Act.
Their donors won't donate if they don't pass tax cuts, their voters won't vote for them if they do.

7. Change the way you fund campaigns and you change who can run &amp; who they listen to once they're in office!
6. Small-donor matching systems mean women leaders can run on the support of their communities, even without big donors.
5. So if you want to see more #WomenInPolitics (and we hope you do!) let's change how we fund campaigns so it's no longer a barrier.
4. We made an illustrated explanation of how this works, to learn more: https://t.co/Zozr2hZvj4
3. One of the barriers, a big one, is money in politics. Women often lack access to networks of wealthy people &amp; can't fund a campaign.
2. BUT we also need to be real about the barriers that women face to running. Barriers that have been designed to keep them from running.
