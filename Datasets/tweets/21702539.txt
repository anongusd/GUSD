Did Mitchell conclude who was more credible?	@BenSasse: “I’m going to go back to my office and review the rest of the documents.”	Any discussion about delaying committee vote?	“There’s a vote tomorrow morning.”	Will it be successful?	No answer. 	Would not say how he is voting.
Leaving GOP mtg, @BenSasse says “Rachel Mitchell just gave us a very good 30ish minute presentation on facts that were established and were not established today. I’m going to go back to my office and review the relevant documents and see you all at the markup tomorrow morning.”
We just saw AZ prosecutor Rachel Mitchell leaving the closed door meeting of all republican senators in McConnell’s suite of offices. As he departed, Sen Roger Wicker told us Mitchell had provided the senators with her “assessment.” He wouldn’t say what that assessment was.

On Senate floor, Sen Flake laments the fact that many on Judiciary have already made up their minds. "One is tempted to ask, why even bother to have a hearing?" Says he can't say where he stands until after the hearing bc "I am not psychic. I am not gifted with clairvoyance."
Distressed GOP aide to me, just now: 		“@MichaelAvenatti brought the heat.”		“America should be sad.” 		Implication: Swetnick’s allegations could have a major impact on Kavanaugh’s chances, even though many republicans still think he would make a great Supreme Court Justice.
As @VP walked into a Senate Republican steering committee luncheon, I asked him if Kavanaugh should withdraw his nomination. He looked at me but did not answer.
.@ThomTillis, who is on Judiciary, says he has seen the Swetnick allegations. “I’m trying to figure out the credibility of the source.” Also paying close attention to Kavanaugh’s response to the allegation. Doesn’t think the growing number of women necessarily indicates a pattern
A very frustrated @OrrinHatch encounters a phalanx of reporters outside a Finance committee hearing. “I’m not in a very good mood!” he declared. Said he had not reviewed the Swetnick declaration yet. “Ok, ok!!” he shouted as an aide tried to move him along, away from reporters.
Standing there, it seemed like @SenateMajLdr had a brain cramp while searching his mind for the word “attorney.” So he went with “assistant.”  		It was surprising that he said she would insure respectful questioning. Implied that GOP senators couldn’t be counted on for respect. https://t.co/1sMrpDkH2i
Is it still yesterday?
Me: Have you heard from the democrats on the Judiciary Committee? 	@MichaelAvenatti: “No.”		Me: Is your client having second thoughts about coming forward?	Avenatti: “She’s remaining strong, but this is a big deal.”
.@MichaelAvenatti on Judiciary cmte: “They didn’t respond to our request for an FBI investigation, didn’t respond to our offer of a polygraph examination,didn’t give us an update on Mark Judge,didn’t tell us they posed the questions to Judge Kavanaugh,they haven’t done anything!”
Asked @MichaelAvenatti abt reports he was pranked by a @4chan user. “I had to go online to look, and I read this post, and I’m laughing! None of that happened. It’s a complete fabrication. There’s zero truth to it. When I say zero truth, I mean zero truth.”
@JimInhofe: This is new to America to have someone come along, make accusations about someone without any without any documentation, totally denied by everyone who could be a witness.	Me: So you think these women are making it up?	Inhofe: They had a little help, I have a feeling.
Per @boknowsbest: @JohnCornyn says republicans on the Senate Judiciary Committee are leaning toward having an attorney question Ford for the GOP senators Thursday. Cornyn did not say if they would use a staff or outside lawyer. He was asked for a name but did not provide it.
More from Kavanaugh to Judiciary Committee: “These are smears, pure and simple. And they debase our public discourse. But they also are a threat to any man or woman who wishes to serve our country. Such grotesque and obvious character assassination” will dissuade ppl from service

.@MichaelAvenatti tells me his client intends to go public this week with her story about Brett Kavanaugh’s behavior in high school. 		"When America hears from my client, they, like me, will find her very credible. We don't traffic in nonsense and rumor."
.@ChrisCoons says he agrees with @SenFeinstein about pausing for an investigation: committee should “delay the (Ford) hearing until there’s an effort by FBI to clarify the details surrounding both Ford’s and Ramirez’s allegations as well as Mark Judge’s recollections.”
.@ChrisCoons tells me "I had heard allegations about the Ramirez incident without knowing her name." Also: "I don't know what to make of @MichaelAvenatti 's stunning allegations -- I'm going to withhold judgment or comment on that until he comes forward w/more."
Ford attorney: “It’s not surprising that Ms Keyser has no recollection of the evening as they did not discuss it. It’s also unremarkable that Ms. Keyser does not remember attending a specific gathering 30 years ago at which nothing of consequence happened to her.”
We reported on the Judiciary Committee’s email to Keyser on @CBSEveningNews last night. Her attorney’s response means the committee has now heard back from everyone Ford says attended the party. All four people either deny they were there or say they don’t remember it.

DOJ IG concludes that the decision by prosecutors not to charge Clinton with "gross negligence" was "consistent with the Department's historical approach in prior cases..including the 2008 decision not to prosecute former AG Alberto Gonzales for mishandling classified documents."
DOJ IG: "We concluded that Comey's unilateral announcement" violated protocol by "criticizing Clinton's uncharged conduct. We also found that Comey usurped the authority of the Attorney General", who had not fully recused herself from the investigation.
More from DOJ IG, on Comey announcing Clinton case conclusions w/o notifying DOJ (7/5/16): "We found that it was extraordinary and insubordinate for Comey to do so, and we found none of his reasons to be a persuasive basis for deviating from well-established Department policies"
DOJ IG report: "we did not find documentary or testimonial evidence that improper considerations, including political bias, directly affected the specific investigative decisions" made by prosecutors/investigators involved in Clinton email probe.
Ryan didn’t blame WH zero tolerance policy. “What’s happening at the border and the separation of parents/children is bc of a court ruling.”

POTUS admits he "really didn't care about" ANWR until someone reminded him that GOP presidents dating back to Reagan had tried unsuccessfully to pass ANWR legislation.
POTUS on dems at State of the Union: "They sat there, stone cold, no smile, no applause..." which indicates maybe "they'd rather see us not do well than see our country do great."

@stephenfhayes Absolutely. I'm saying Ryan's Medicare proposals don't appear to hurt Romney w/ FL srs, even if the proposals poll poorly.
@stephenfhayes bc Ryan has proposed partially privatizing Medicare. That didn't poll well, but srs in FL still went for Romney by lrg margin
More than a third of voters in FL and OH said they hadn't heard enough about Ryan to form an opinion of him: 36% FL, 40% OH, 20% WI.
Romney and Ryan have the same favorable rating in Wisconsin: 44%. But Ryan's unfavorables are lower: 35% to Romney's 43%.
They may favor keeping Medicare as is, but seniors in our poll still prefer Romney by 13 pts in FL. The President lost them by 8 pts in 08.

But repub leaders are unlikely to appt members who look favorably on tax increases. They'd have about 2 weeks or less to assign cmte members

@RealClearScott I can't think of a better way to spend a Thursday evening in the summer

Such is the state of the debt debate.
Schumer closes, to chuckles: "Ladies and gentlemen, THIS is your House majority." McCarthy's office: no comment but confirms clip was shown
More Schumer: "Literally in the movie the protagonists say 'people are going to get hurt' but they have to go ahead and do it anyway."
Schumer on "The Town": In scene Rs chose to inspire House frosh, one crook gives pep talk to the other right b4 they shoot a man in the leg
Just spoke to sev House R's who had been leaning no on Boehner plan...now they lean yes...don't let perfect be enemy of good says Farenthold

Were Senators duped by fake bin Laden photos? Our story  http://bit.ly/lkZ1eq
Republican Senators Scott Brown (R-MA), Kelly Ayotte (R-NH), and Saxby Chambliss (R-GA) were all duped by fake OBL death photos
Did enhanced interrogation tactics contribute to bin Laden's capture? http://bit.ly/luAbkn
My writeup on members' reactions to President's decision on gruesome photos -- most say they are satisfed: http://bit.ly/lLcgmF
Briefers told House members that they were deliberately holding back certain details from them in order to maintain "competitive edge"
House members emerging from closed briefing with Panetta et al say they were not shown pics of Osama deceased.
They are sitting at their desks in a symbolic gesture. Normally for votes they mill about on the Senate floor. Vote happening now.
Imminent vote on Senate resolution honoring military members who raided compound. Most members already in the chamber sitting at their desks
Feinstein on waterbrding: "I happen to knw a grt deal about how those interr were cnducted and nothing justifies those kinds of procedures."
Sen Feinstein, Intel Chair: To best of our knowledge at first glance none of the clues appear to have come fm harsh interrogation practices.
Democratic House leaders always forget their new titles. Funnily enough, the Republican leaders never have this problem.
Pelosi: I say Hail to the Chief, a real tribute to the Commander in Chief.
@theSPsays First journalist to report it in any forum, as far as we can tell. It just happened to be on Twitter.
Congrats to my friend and CBS colleague @jacksonjk who was first to break the news on Twitter last night that OBL was dead. Follow her.
Rogers says he has been communicating w Panetta abt mission for past 4 months and was in touch w him all weekend.
Rogers says he was first briefed about compound in early Jan when they thought OBL was there but they didn't have enough intel to be sure
House Intel Chair Mike Rogers says special forces cheered when they found out that the mission they were about to go on was to get OBL
Lieberman says it will probably be necessary to release the gruesome pics of OBL if al Qaeda does not acknowledge that he has been killed.
Collins calls Pakistan a "critical but uncertain ally." Says hard to understand how this huge compound was built w/o arousing suspicion.
Collins says she's worried about a homegrown terror attack by a lone wolf type too.
Senator Collins: in this operation we saw exactly the opposite of the "silo" mentality that used to hamper nat security and intel community
Lieberman: it was fitting that bin Laden was killed just as democracies are being born in the Arab world
Sen Lieberman, chair of Homeland Security, says his great concern is that a radicalized lone wolf will take action against American people
Senator Scott Brown confirms he has asked to do his annual National Guard training in Afghanistan, most likely this summer.
Leader Reid says he was informed by the White House at 9:30 last night and spoke to a "somber" President Obama shortly thereafter.

It's getting testy. Coons references all the national attention O'Donnell's getting. She jokes he's just jealous she was spoofed on SNL
There are several people in witch costume outside the auditorium -- some for O'Donnell, some against. One sign reads "Coven for Christine"
