The appropriations requests are due on April 5th.  If you haven’t had a chance yet, please take a moment to contact your representative.
The AHEC budget helps the national network carry out administrative priorities for the AHEC program.
There is a growing unmet need for primary care doctors in rural areas that the AHEC program helps to meet.
Write, Email or Call your representative and ask for AHEC to be added to the 2015 fiscal year budget.
Today is the last day to reach out to your Congress representatives and express your support for the AHEC program.
Follow up with the healthcare staffer and ask them if the Congress member submitted an appropriations request on behalf of the AHEC program.
Give the healthcare staffer your contact information and ask to be informed about the actions the legislator takes in response to your...
Tell the aide that you are calling on behalf of [your community/state AHEC].
Identify yourself as a constituent and ask to speak with the legislator’s Healthcare Legislative Assistant.
For those who want to contact your congressional offices, watch for tips to make sure your call is effective.
When contacting your representative ask for continued support and funding for the AHEC program at $75 million for 2015.
Phone calls work best; however, please feel free to email your Representative’s healthcare staffer.
You can identify your Representative by going to http://t.co/PXbvLXxqKO and entering your zip code in the top right corner.
Reach out to your members of Congress Now, and emphasize the value in supporting adequate funding for the Title VII AHEC program.
We are working towards the AHEC full appropriate of $125 million.
For the fiscal year 2015 we are asking funding for the AHEC program at $75 million.
It is important for anyone affiliated with the AHEC program to reach out to members of Congress to ask for support.
The president released his fiscal year 2015 budget proposal, which did not provide funding for the AHEC program.
The AHEC program was funded at $30.326 million for fiscal year 2014 after originally not being included in the budget.
Not only is this project just the right thing to do, we’re also providing $1,500 in financial support for training 50 health professionals.
It is extremely important that we have excellent participation from AHECs in our current A-TrACC project to train health professional.
Many of the legislative representatives I talked with this past week asked about AHEC’s involvement in ACA outreach and education.
