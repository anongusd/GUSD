@CillizzaCNN Are your feelings still angry?
@CillizzaCNN This is the problem with journalist like you.  What makes you think we care about your feelings?  Just try and accurately report the news.  America I‚Äôm angry....you sound like a petulant child.

@ananavarro It‚Äôs hard to believe this is even reported.  I respect you as a powerful, successful, fearless woman.  Responding to this lessens you.  You‚Äôre taking the bait.
@ChrisCuomo So had you‚Äôd been outside unarmed you wouldn‚Äôt have ran in?  Sad to see other adults seething at the chance to criticize the President at children‚Äôs lives expense.

@KingJames Do you encourage your kids to say *uck or think someone of your influence should use that language as a role model?  Your point could have still been easily made.
