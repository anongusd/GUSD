@WhattaSavage yea I admit that but also if you look at the depth on that team it was obscene

@WhattaSavage oh c'mon dude that was the cavs team with Lebron and only Lebron.  The heat sucked with only wade and the hawks are the hawks
@WhattaSavage I know that's what I'm saying. Yes the magic made it but in a very depleted eastern conference.  There was no solid other team
@WhattaSavage kg was out the second year perk was still in
@WhattaSavage
@WhattaSavage @KobyDoinWork and you are correct about the mavericks but even so look at that bench and starting lineup.  Depth was unreal
@WhattaSavage @KobyDoinWork Dwight didn't win and the lakers exposed that team as one that prospered due to a kgless celtics team
