@SenSasse I was a lawyer once.
@SenSasse I think eliminating defense lawyers would see a swift increase in prosecutions.
@Nearysvoice @LQQKYLou @algore This is the real account of former President George W Bush.  The name "Al Gore" was simply misspelled.
@Pumas_Dav1d @JanetDodd7 @EdKrassen @BarackObama @RalphNortham @PhilMurphyNJ Trump hurt Jebbie. Vote Bush in 2020
I like freedom. I like the freedom to spy on people especially
Who wants five more terms of me? #Bush46

I believe that we need to strengthen our presence in the Middle East and send 200,000 U.S. troops to Syria in order to stabalise the world
In America, we need more strategery and better defense forces. We need to rebuild our presence in the world.
I believe that we need to refresh the spirit of the GOP
I want to be very clear: immigrants are not the problem with this country

I like immigrants because they are good at making enchiladas
Our Congress needs to come together as it did with me in the 2000s.
Shout out to all the troops that have fought for our country from Revolution to Iraq. #Iraqforever #VereransDay2017

Our President needs to respect other countries and nations. We are a nation built off immigrants which President Trump doesn't understand. I like the Mexican people because I like Tacos. Long live America.
