Here in Hanoi, the respect and admiration for the late John McCain is evident. He was a POW, and later used that moral authority to lead the reconciliation between the U S. and Vietnam.		John McCain has departed this Earth, but the people of Vietnam have not forgotten him.

Ummm... what now? https://t.co/tT2aJfMz6c
@QAnonsMom uhhhh no.
Anyhoo, back to those LGBTQ kids, who are wondering where they stand: 	- I know this hurts. I'm sorry for that. I wish I could change that but I can't.	- You are made in the image of God. Fearfully and wonderfully made	- You are loved		And for what it's worth, I stand with you.
You know, there was a choice presented to the Isrealites... Choose you this day who you will serve. 		Well, you know what? I agree, there is a choice. As for me and my house, we will serve the Lord. 		And that means love. Active love. Love is love is love is love is love.
The Methodist Church is a vast body. It runs across the world and in the U.S. counts both Jeff Sessions and Hillary Clinton. That's quite a range. 		But it's run by people. People are humans. Humans aren't perfect. All have sinned and fallen short of the glory of God.
If you hold to the Levitical laws though, and reject that replacement doctrine, you'll have to find me someplace biblical that allows you to cherry pick which rules to follow. 		Thing is though, that doesn't exist.		You gotta choose one. Christianity isn't the Old Country Buffet.
Friends, the Bible as it's generally assembled in Protestant faiths is actually really clear on the changing of Levitical laws to a Christian law that is foundationally about an active love for your fellow human being. 		The active love bit, John Wesley talked a LOT about that.
Another great place to run is to where Jesus is asked what the Greatest Commandment is... it's a bit of a trick question, but Jesus goes ahead and answers anyway. 		The whole of the law boils down to this, he says:	- Love God fully &amp; above all	- Love your neighbor as yourself
Now, biblically, if you really want to dive in, go to Acts. A dream Peter had, where he was commanded to eat stuff the old Levitical rules said were "unclean". Peter, who took stuff literally, said no.		And then, the rebuke: ‚ÄúDo not call anything impure that God has made clean.‚Äù
First: To my LGBTQ friends -- and especially to kids in the Church who know they're gay and wonder about how their lives will change when they let the world in on that secret, know this:	- YOU are loved	- YOU are valued	- You MATTER	- God loves YOU
It's my faith and my denomination, so I get to speak out on this: This vote by the @UMChurch leadership was absolutely shameful. It cannot be justified by a faithful reading of scripture. And I rebuke it. 		If you'd like, a short thread on my reasoning.	https://t.co/bpcVbPeY4n

I loved working with Sho Chandra. More than that, I loved being her friend. 		I will miss her fiercely.
Above all in a colleague, she valued decency. I'll keep most of our conversations to myself here, but I will say she had no time for assholes. 		If you were in the fight to make the world of journalism a better, more diverse, more inclusive place though... you had no better ally.
Sho had a heart for mentoring. She believed in reaching out to the next generation. She loved watching young reporters grow. She never gave up on anyone. 		And she was, in the finest tradition of it, a happy warrior. To know Sho was to love Sho.
Sho was a brilliant reporter, able to spin narrative out of numbers like no one I've ever seen. Anything you've read from Bloomberg that explained the U.S. economy over the last many years has either been written by Sho or someone she sat next to and mentored.

There are other parts of the Bible that talk about sacrificial giving, and in all cases I can think of, the emphasis is on relative giving, not absolute giving. 		So I struggle to see Rev. Falwell's point. I mean, I get what he's driving at, but that's a worldly not Biblical view
Jesus continues, and this is important:		"So He said, ‚ÄúTruly I say to you that this poor widow has put in more than all; for all these out of their abundance have put in offerings for God, but she out of her poverty put in all the livelihood that she had.‚Äù
"And He looked up and saw the rich putting their gifts into the treasury, and He saw also a certain poor widow putting in two mites."		This is Jesus, talking in parable, directly comparing gifts by the rich and the poor. In your Red Letter Bibles, this stuff is in red.

So here we are again, with the GOP in political, not policy bind. They've gotten out of fiscal jams with Dem help before, but that cavalry's not coming. 	There's an obvious way out, but GOP leaders really really don't want to cross Trump.		So I'm probably working tomorrow.	4/4
Nancy Pelosi has negative incentive to bend at all, or help the GOP out of a bind of its own making. Which is to say, if she helps, it hurts her.		Ditto Chuck Schumer, who's still taking incoming lefty flak over earlier judges deals.		A shutdown is bad policy/worse optics	3/4
In the Senate, you need Democrats to pass spending bills. 		But honestly, it's a major question if the House Republican majority has enough votes for a CR + $5 million for the wall. They probably don't, because if you've got the votes you vote and they're not voting.	2/4
The GOP's problem with the CR, simply explained:	- You need Dems to pass $$ bills	- GOP don't have votes for wall $$	- Not even close	- Trump really wants wall $$	- They probably (with Dems) have the votes to override a veto	- House/Senate GOP leaders don't want to jam Trump	1/4

@DomenicoNPR @TheDemocrats IS THERE A KIDS TABLE THOUGH?!?!!?

@ResoluteRenee There certainly are Democrats and independents who support the wall just like there are Republicans who think it's a dumb idea.		That's not the GoFundMe pitch though, it is specifically targeting Trump supporters with an under-inflated cost.		It's misleading at best.
Lesson: Don't mess with Minnesota.		Also don't make shit up generally but especially if you're a reporter. https://t.co/GcoqA34fqO

The math in the GoFundMe wall pitch is wrong. It's much more than $80 a person.	- 63m Trump voters and wall costs at least $21.6b = $343/pp	BUT...	- Wall costs likely higher.

@Britt_Ghiroli @TalkNats2 @TheAthleticDC Does this count as the first ever O's-Nats trade?
So I'm watching the House. I want to know what Steve Scalise's vote count is right now. 		Because if Republicans need Nancy Pelosi's help to pass a spending bill, their hand is meaningfully weaker than what they are letting on right now
But the real question here is honestly the House.		If GOP has the votes in the House, compromise is with nine Democratic senators. If they don't, Nancy Pelosi needs to be on board. 		And Pelosi, who is running for speaker, has zero incentive to fold.
Republicans of course can't do everything themselves. They need 60 votes in the Senate to thwart a legislative filibuster. They have 51 Republicans in the chamber.
Reminder as we talked about wall money and shutdowns: GOP has a majority in the House, Senate, and White House. 		They have struggled to get votes in the House before.		(Small thread)

A major change in Detroit: 	- John Conyers was in Congress representing Detroit from 1965 to 2017. 	- A Conyers is on the ballot to replace him	- That individual is currently running 4th of 4 in the special election primary, and 5th of 6 in the general election primary
Next time I get asked my race to watch, it's #MI11. 		Why? Neither candidate will have universal name recognition. Metro Detroit is too expensive to blanket the airwaves. A GOP-leaning district but not heavily so. And polls close at 8p.		So you'll know &amp; know early #TicTocNews
Michigan takeaways: 		- Add MI-11 to your must-watch lists	- I see what you did there, East Lansing, passing a non-resident income tax while MSU students were away for the summer	- Former undergrads I met when coming back to MSU to guest lecture are now getting elected.

@DanielStrauss4 The smartest pregame comment was that Sanchez trains with so many of England's players that he knows what they want to do... always. He's just forever in the right spot. Dammit. Great player though.
Davidson Sanchez (Tottenham) is the only reason Dele Alli (Tottenham) and Harry Kane (Tottenham) didn't score just there.

@EdBrookover People should watch more @cspan, like I do. 		But broadly, people are far too quick to say the media doesn't cover something that it very obviously does. You can say there should be more press coverage. But that's not what Trump's saying. He's saying it's not, and that's not true
I'm just saying, this ain't a media blackout. https://t.co/G6xHqSFIPe
@TheStalwart This is like vomit-flavored jelly beans. But someone bought those so wtf do I know.
Trump and multiple people at his event are complaining the media won't cover their point of view. 		They are LIVE on CNN, MSNBC, Fox News, Bloomberg TV, Fox Business right now.
This is really not a good World Cup for people who used to be at Spurs.
@DavidHarns @scottpohlwkar @WKARnews @ReclaimMSU You could do it with reserves. That's another option, to be sure. 		All this will be spelled out in the bond offering, and reporters should brush up on their muni bond knowledge right now.		(they should generally, frankly, but especially now)
@scottpohlwkar @DavidHarns @WKARnews @ReclaimMSU This is plausible only if:	- Insurance covers all of it /or/	- Insurance covers most of it &amp; rest small enough to be made up via other sources. 		University has other income streams, but far smaller. So: Patent revenues redistributed? Donations? Licensing revenues? Asset sales?
@scottpohlwkar @DavidHarns @WKARnews @ReclaimMSU I would be skeptical of that spin until multiple questions answered.		Bonds have to be repaid. How's it going to be repaid, the part that insurance doesn't cover?		And wouldn't the rates spike if MSU told bondholders it would wall off two guaranteed revenue streams as options?

One thing I would add -- lawmakers could try and end this immediately. Or they could package it with a whole bunch of other stuff and try to use this as bait to get stuff they want that people wouldn't usually vote for. 		Like border wall money I was told Mexico is paying for. https://t.co/9xdE0znuhv
The question for federal lawmakers is actually really simple. It's not, do you support the Trump administration's policy. It is instead, will you vote to fund it? Or will you specifically demand as condition for your funding vote that this policy be specifically forbidden? https://t.co/yBRVVk6oD9
Congress with one single line of legislation could end all this.		"None of the funds under this act shall be used to involuntarily separate children from their parents or legal guardians during any stage of the parent, guardian, or child's immigration application or processing." https://t.co/yBRVVk6oD9
It is illegal in the state of Maryland to leave your child unsupervised under the age of 8. 		At the border some kids that age are being taken from their parents and kept in large cages.

Sleeper of the whole tournament: Loyola Chicago &amp; Missouri (got 'em both in the Elite 8)		Hardest games to pick, all in the Sweet 16:	MSU v. Duke	Michigan v. UNC	Villanova v. WVa		Final Four: 	Virginia, Villanova, Michigan, Michigan State. 		Winner: MSU	Talent + Alum + Duke sucks
I kinda talked myself into putting Michigan in the Final Four. Am now, because of severe &amp; well-documented anti-Wolverine biases, trying to talk myself out of it.		Having trouble. Good team, good draw. John Beilein is a helluva coach.
Michigan, for all their fans may be annoyed right now, has an easier path than Michigan State.		MSU blew out Carolina, lost to Duke. We got Duke, you got Carolina. 		Y'all wanna trade us Xavier (in LA) for Kansas in Omaha? Unlikely. https://t.co/dM0SCouz3f
Michigan State's path: 		Bucknell (in Detroit)	TCU (in Detroit)	Duke (in Omaha)	Kansas (in Omaha)		All in the Big Ten footprint. Would like to have avoided Duke, but that's doable.

Trump says he's in favor of a farm bill with crop insurance.

@sambrodey Courts have assumed several must-haves for Minnesota redistricting: 	- No northern belt districts, Red River &amp; Iron Range must be separate	- No combo Mpls/St Paul district		Can both of those hold in a 7-seat world?

College football is just like politics.		Billy's team is the best, Bobby's team sucks, arguments that back up Billy's team are facts, arguments that backup Bobby's team are fake news. And everyone who doesn't agree with me is biased.
@KingJackThe4th Fun fact: Alabama didn't beat anybody as good as Michigan State, according to the college football playoff rankings. 		Or Penn State. Or Wisconsin. Those are all winds on Ohio State's schedule
@pbake14 At some point the interviewer just has to come back and say, coach, I know you think your team belongs, and they're certainly an argument, but to say nobody wanted to play you when you cancelled a home-and-home against what wound up being a 9-win team....
@pbake14 Well that's just objectively not the case.
@Zorak_Trump Yep! That wasn't this season though. There was a home-and-home scheduled, and they cancelled it. Facts are facts however inconvenient.
RT @FauxPelini: This is weird but they designed a 4 team playoff for 5 conferences and they‚Äôre having trouble making it work

Clemson v. UCF	Oklahoma v. Penn State 	Georgia v. USC	Ohio St v. Alabama		I mean, that would be so much better. Just leave it all out on the field. https://t.co/sTfFVHRq2A
This is why there should be an 8-team playoff. 5 conference champions, Best non-power 5, 2 best others, seeded.
@granthpaulsen The case for Ohio State is quality wins. Against Top 20 in CFP, OSU is 3-1. Alabama is 1-1, w/ best win No. 17 LSU. 		OSU has, in point of fact, played 2 teams ranked above Bama, and is 1-1 in those games.
There it is. Ballgame, Buckeyes. 		If you get in the playoff, please score this time.
I wonder if the refs are considering playing just one way here in Indianapolis. 		Northwestern-Illinois had to do that at Wrigley in 2010 so players didn't run into the outfield wall.
@Michaelpaulmos1 It would help OSU's case if they'd showed up against Iowa, yeah		But then we wouldn't be having this conversation at all if FSU showed up the rest of their season. Footballs bounce weird ways. 		There's a sensible argument for Bama. It's close. But OSU has better case for me.
Before I go get crushed on Twitter by @heatherscope's entire extended family, let me note I'm hoping the Badgers win because Madison is amazing and the state of Wisconsin &gt; Ohio generally. https://t.co/ov9iYwzs7b
@Michaelpaulmos1 Fresno State win does look better and better, I'll give you that. But OSU beat Penn State, Michigan State, is leading Wisconsin and lost to Oklahoma.
@lcb257 True. But using this week's rankings, and assuming OSU holds on, Ohio State would be 3-1 vs. Top 20. Bama would be 1-1
@Michaelpaulmos1 You don't get to count Florida State as if they're the #3 team in the nation. They're 6-6. Sorry.
Football bracket is pretty simple from here, I think:	Clemson-Wisconsin/OSU	Oklahoma-Georgia		Yes, Ohio State over Alabama, if they win. Strength of Schedule - Buckeyes would have 3 better wins (per CFP rankings) than Alabama's best win.
Salient point. "Not Trump" isn't on the ballot. An actual human is and they'll have to win states Trump won last time. https://t.co/BR9zx6hAXB
@BobWMurphy It's that it can't cut relative to the budget it is reconciling. The measure it is reconciling assumes revenue losses of 1.5 trillion over the next 10 years. So that became the static revenue loss maximum for the tax reconciliation bill.

@sbell021 Alabama is out for me. Just 2 top 25 wins. Not their fault FSU sucks, or that their schedule skipped Georgia, but that's sort of the way it shook out.		I'd not only take 2-loss OSU ahead, but 2-loss Clemson AND Miami ahead of them.
