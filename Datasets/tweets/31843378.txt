@derjue @swimman79 @mreils That thought stemmed from me trying to figure out if I could afford to take Uber to/from work. I would like that.
@derjue @mreils I do suspect he's lowballing w/ $150. A $5 Uber to and from work would be $200/month, and that's a short ass drive.
@derjue haha I balked at that until I realized my monthly subway pass is almost as much
Is it me or have there been a world record number of #tbt posts today?
I just started following @WWKD_Official and it's about damn time because I ask myself that every time I get dressed.
