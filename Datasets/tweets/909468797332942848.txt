@CrudonGarcia @Dragobaby @dhamarxo @thegreatkhalid @BetoORourke You can‚Äôt call it a rigged election because he brought in more money. He raised a substantial amount of money without taking a dime from PACs and that says a lot. If anything PACs rig the election not regular citizens.

@Elle_Eff247 @K8withbatteries @carobi557 @thegreatkhalid @TrumpEra_2017 @BetoORourke I never said anything about forgetting qualifications. I said we need a woman on the ticket.

@agentbeach1 @c_a_charbonneau @EdKrassen @SteveSchmidtSES Yeah but Avenatti  is not a good pick for president or VP. If he ran, it would make it seem as though stormi Daniels did this due to political motivation. Doesn‚Äôt look good for Avenatti, Daniels, or the Dems.
@SophieInCT @SallyBMetal @EdKrassen Why would you want someone who isn‚Äôt a strong nominee. It was proven in 2016 that she couldn‚Äôt get the left and moderates at the same time. We need someone who‚Äôs a new face but still qualified. We don‚Äôt need Sanders, Biden, Clinton, or Kerry running. We need someone young.
@agentbeach1 @c_a_charbonneau @EdKrassen Avenatti running for President is a bad idea. Not only would it ruin his reputation, but it would ruin the Dems if he was the nominee. We need someone who‚Äôs actually qualified. Someone who is liked by the left and moderates. We need someone who will win.

So my message here is basically be nice. There are people mourning a death. There‚Äôs no reason for you to chime in with your negative thoughts. #RIPJohnMcCain #foreverinourhearts #AmericanPatriot #AmericanHero
You don‚Äôt have to hate someone because they think differently or because they didn‚Äôt like what someone said. I hope John McCain‚Äôs death will bring us together. This is not about politics, but I think John would love it if both parties worked together in his name.
Now don‚Äôt get me wrong. I‚Äôm not calling out just the GOP, but I am calling out everyone who wanted to spread hate on a day people mourned a death. That includes the people from the left too, even if that is a smaller handful (from what I have saw at least).
The fact that people can sit there and mock the passing of someone who‚Äôs dedicated their whole life for this country is hard for at least me to see. I honestly can only hope that Cindy and the rest of the family only see the positive messages for the man they loved.
Today has been a day of grieving in the McCain family and in politics. With the passing of #JohnMcCain, I have come to a realization that most of trump supporters don‚Äôt back him because of their ignorance, but because they are just as bad or worse than @realDonaldTrump.

@TLQ1958 @caljustice1 @steph93065 Lol no and it was an honest mistake. I hadn‚Äôt realized that @caljustice1 had blocked me so when you commented it looked like you were just talking to me
@TLQ1958 @caljustice1 @steph93065 My bad it must of been directed to the other bunches of people currently in this argument.

@TLQ1958 @caljustice1 @steph93065 Lol again not mad. There‚Äôs a difference when someone sits there accusing people with no proof (which is a conspiracy with zero facts) I‚Äôve asked many times for evidence and no one can prove anything... so there for it‚Äôs not an opinion rather you just being ignorant
@TLQ1958 @caljustice1 @steph93065 No i really am not. I‚Äôve been laughing this whole time about your just lack of knowledge. If you read my post, I never said you accused me specifically of anything (even though you did accuse me of being a fascist) anyways it sounds like you were mad at me from the beginning
@TLQ1958 @caljustice1 @steph93065 Who, the players in the nfl? I bet you their revenue will drop when they lose a bunch of players that are already rich and don‚Äôt need to continue playing. It‚Äôs all about buisness. But you sit here and act like I said the nfl has no right to this. I didn‚Äôt btw.
@TLQ1958 @caljustice1 @steph93065 If this is all about you being mad about companies pulling his crap, trying to say they can‚Äôt. These companies own the right. And to the nfl, do I think they should be allowed, yes. But is it the organizations decision in the end? Sadly.
@TLQ1958 @caljustice1 @steph93065 Did I shut down your voice? No! Are you still here exercising your 1A? Yes! Are you, in your own terms trying to shut down my voice? Yes! Are you definitely overreacting to the situation? Absolutely, yes!

@caljustice1 @tlq1958 @steph93065 Last time I checked, antifa has nothing to do with voting. Also, if you did your research, you would know that there are plenty of other states that let you register before you are 18.
@tlq1958 @caljustice1 @steph93065 Give me a break! Their names don‚Äôt even appear on the registration to vote until they‚Äôre 18. It would be very rare that not only their name appear but they also were trying to vote in that same election. And underage voting isn‚Äôt a thing. You just came up with that.

@caljustice1 @steph93065 Lol this is just getting quite pathetic now. Do you have any proof of the voter fraud. Do you even have proof of California breaking a law by letting 16 year olds register to vote? When you do let me know. Other than that, your argument is pointless.
@caljustice1 @steph93065 What? You honestly are making no sense now.  They are registering so they can vote at 18.
@caljustice1 @steph93065 You can register to vote 6 months before your birthday in some states. It varies. And how is it messing with minors? 1) the act of actually voting is happening at 18 2) they‚Äôre still minors at 17 1/2

@caljustice1 @steph93065 What? You don‚Äôt have to be 18 to register. There are people who‚Äôs birthdays are on election day, which by your reasoning, would make them ineligible to vote. But if that‚Äôs not enough for you, what law is it specifically that she‚Äôs breaking?

@caljustice1 @steph93065 So no there isn‚Äôt any voting laws being broke.
@caljustice1 @steph93065 People who register to vote. You have to register before voting which is where she gets the ‚Äúpre‚Äù from. And you are registering to vote so you are pre-registering to vote. Also the way you worded it made it sound like you were voting which isn‚Äôt the case. It would be ‚Äúto vote.‚Äù
@steph93065 Proof of this? Or even how you came up with this. Otherwise we really do have a witch hunt on our hands.
@Soulm81 @sixkopps @GrahamLedger @RepDevinNunes @GOP And did it really kill ‚Äúfreedom of choice at the ballot box?‚Äù Because if there is two Dems on the ballots it‚Äôs because Californians chose those two.
@Soulm81 @sixkopps @GrahamLedger @RepDevinNunes @GOP No it‚Äôs definitely republicans fault for not having an r on the ballot for senate.

@Soulm81 @sixkopps @GrahamLedger @RepDevinNunes @GOP No need to get mad.

The only people you can blame is your own party.
@harvey_meade @GrahamLedger You can still officially change your party preference. Also, if you didn‚Äôt vote for the party, it wouldn‚Äôt matter if the party claimed your vote before because they didn‚Äôt get your vote.

@Willie88539823 @Trekman100 @JohnKasich I don‚Äôt disagree. What I‚Äôm trying to state is that there is a lot that just happened to this district. The district went from voting for trump by 11% and leaning republican by +7, to barely voting R. Also to note: these two will still face off against each other in November.
@Trekman100 @Willie88539823 @JohnKasich Trump won the district by 11% and Balderson only won by about .9%. I think Trump coming to Ohio only hurt Balderson in the election. But I mean if you want to believe it was trump then go ahead and send him to districts that are close elections. I know I‚Äôm not stopping you or him
O‚ÄôConnor lost lost by only .9%. This also does not include the college students who will vote in November when these candidates face off again. There are also more than 3,000 provisional ballots that haven‚Äôt been counted. #ElectionResults #OH12 #DannyOConnor #SpecialElections
#OH12 Update: Balderson gets 50.2% of the vote. O‚ÄôConnor got 49.3% of the vote which put him behind by 1,766 votes. Now things to remember: the GOP outspent the Dems in this race by about $4.8 million. Trump won the district by 11% and the district leans R by +7.
@jrlowery33 This is about how things could play out in districts that don‚Äôt lean towards republicans as much. This district leans toward republicans +7 and voted for trump by 11%. This also isn‚Äôt exactly over as the seat is still up in November. This vote didn‚Äôt include college students also
@tossdemsout Communist? You realize communism is not only more of a conservative belief but it‚Äôs not something that‚Äôs taking over the Democratic Party. If anything it is socialism taking over the party. Now if you knew anything about that, you‚Äôd know that they aren‚Äôt the same.
@John_Sevigny Not necessarily! There‚Äôs a lot that goes into this. Ohio‚Äôs 12th leans toward republicans by 7 points. If Dems target republican districts that don‚Äôt lean republican as much, I believe they could successfully win back the House and definitely the senate.
Update: O‚ÄôConnor trails Balderson by 741 votes with 95% of precincts in. #ohioprimary #OH12 #SpecialElection #Elections2018
Update: O‚ÄôConnor is up by .1% or a close 201 votes. There is about 91% of precincts reporting. This is a close race that has to be watched until the end. #OH12 #DANNYOCONNOR #Ohio12 #SpecialElection #ElectionResults
Update: With 89% of precincts in, Balderson is up by 1,031 votes. This gives the republicans about a .6% lead against O‚ÄôConnor. #OH12 #Ohio12th #SpecialElection #ElectionResults2018
Update: Danny O‚ÄôConnor (D) is pulling 85,678 votes while his republican opponent, Balderson, has 85,523 (about a .1% difference). 85% of precincts are reporting and there is just 115 votes separating these two political opponents. #ElectionResults #Ohio12th #SpecialElection

@HogHunny @IzzyBoo601 @_Spike27_ @D2GLS @tod_young @SenKamalaHarris What facts do I not like? That fact that George W. bush won the 2004 popular vote but didn‚Äôt win California or New York? The fact that you guys made up the myth ‚Äútwo states would pick the president if we had the popular vote?‚Äù You haven‚Äôt given in facts.
@D2GLS @HogHunny @IzzyBoo601 @_Spike27_ @tod_young @SenKamalaHarris It‚Äôs not about the states in this situation. The president doesn‚Äôt represent we the states, they represent we the people. Now if you wanted fair representation of the states, that‚Äôs where you get 2 senators each and a number of house of reps. Depending on population.
@HogHunny @IzzyBoo601 @_Spike27_ @D2GLS @tod_young @SenKamalaHarris Listen, I have a question for you. Why do we vote as states rather than individuals for president? We vote as individuals in every other election. After all, the president is representing we the people and not we the states!
@HogHunny @IzzyBoo601 @_Spike27_ @D2GLS @tod_young @SenKamalaHarris Now if you want to bring in the fact that oh the two biggest states are liberal, that doesn‚Äôt mean crap. There have been many republicans who have won the popular vote. The states with the popular vote are getting as much power as they deserve
@HogHunny @IzzyBoo601 @_Spike27_ @D2GLS @tod_young @SenKamalaHarris Now is that more than most states? Yes, but they are getting only as much power as the people voting in the election. And it makes sense that a bigger state has more influence since it‚Äôs going to impact more people.
@HogHunny @IzzyBoo601 @_Spike27_ @D2GLS @tod_young @SenKamalaHarris Please, just because it‚Äôs been doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs working correctly. Now it‚Äôs a total myth that just two states could possible pick an election. The state with the most registered voters only represents 9.7% of the registered voters and no candidate with ever get all votes.

@NotTfw @_Spike27_ @D2GLS @tod_young @SenKamalaHarris What do you mean by ‚Äúbut if it was house seats.‚Äù I‚Äôm not following what you‚Äôre referencing
@NotTfw @_Spike27_ @D2GLS @tod_young @SenKamalaHarris I said that because you keep on saying California was the reason Hillary one the popular vote. Yeah it‚Äôs true but a stupid fact that doesn‚Äôt mean crap.
@NotTfw @_Spike27_ @D2GLS @tod_young @SenKamalaHarris Okay and like I said in a close election with the electoral college, one state could be the determining factor. The president doesn‚Äôt represent we the states, they represent we the people. Senators represent the states.
@NotTfw @_Spike27_ @D2GLS @tod_young @SenKamalaHarris Lol I‚Äôm spewing nonsense. You said I‚Äôm not a native English speaker when you don‚Äôt even know me. You‚Äôve only attacked me, yet haven‚Äôt showed many facts. So why don‚Äôt you get back to your 15 followers and spread more hate through twitter.
@NotTfw @_Spike27_ @D2GLS @tod_young @SenKamalaHarris Okay I‚Äôm done debating you because you really don‚Äôt know what you‚Äôre talking about. You‚Äôve just attacked me. And yes I am native English speaker, and I‚Äôm on top of my class. Don‚Äôt make assumptions about me when you don‚Äôt know me one bit.
@NotTfw @_Spike27_ @D2GLS @tod_young @SenKamalaHarris It gives higher population states a little more power considering the president is going to  impact more people their. And the electoral college still gives them more power. And it‚Äôs Twitter but if you want to correct someone on grammar look trumps Twitter.
@NotTfw @_Spike27_ @D2GLS @tod_young @SenKamalaHarris And if theirs a close election with the electoral college, their could be one state that determines the winner so don‚Äôt even play that card.
@NotTfw @_Spike27_ @D2GLS @tod_young @SenKamalaHarris Yeah in this election. Stop comparing it to this election and reasoning it. Look at the overall picture. If people voted along their party and independents voted blue, Dems would only get 6.9% of the vote. Republicans have one the popular vote before so it‚Äôs not unheard of.
@NotTfw @_Spike27_ @D2GLS @tod_young @SenKamalaHarris Go ahead and check my numbers ‚Äúnumbskull.‚Äù
@NotTfw @_Spike27_ @D2GLS @tod_young @SenKamalaHarris If you did some research you would know that California contains only 9.7% of registered voters. Now to win the popular vote you need 50% of voters. Now see even if 100% votes blue, the dem candidate doesn‚Äôt automatically win because 9.7%&lt;50%. I know it‚Äôs kinda some hard math!
@IzzyBoo601 @_Spike27_ @HogHunny @D2GLS @tod_young @SenKamalaHarris Why are we electing a president through states? The president is representing us the people. We don‚Äôt elect our senators through counties. It‚Äôs quite ridiculous that you would want someone president that the majority of Americans don‚Äôt want nor voted for.
@NotTfw @_Spike27_ @D2GLS @tod_young @SenKamalaHarris There isn‚Äôt one state that could decide an election alone. I don‚Äôt know how you think in any type of system that people‚Äôs votes shouldn‚Äôt really count just because of where they live. And don‚Äôt act like republicans wouldn‚Äôt be able to win because they‚Äôve popular votes before.

@Ummmmichelle @NumberO61435898 @JudgeJeanine @TheView What I‚Äôm saying is I think it was a catastrophe. Do I think Whoopi should have acted like that today. No! But do I think Jeanine should have attacked her like that. No! So it seems like your the one that is only seeing one side.

@Ummmmichelle @NumberO61435898 @JudgeJeanine @TheView I‚Äôm not saying that Whoopi was a class act today. What I‚Äôm saying is this all could have been prevented if Jeanine would have not attacked Whoopi, than this wouldn‚Äôt have happened. And it‚Äôs also hard to have ‚Äúproductive dialogue‚Äù with someone who doesn‚Äôt answer questions
@GhostPsyborg @NumberO61435898 @JudgeJeanine @TheView @KellyannePolls Walking into an ambush? If you had real facts, you would know how to fight your way out of that situation. Oh wait! One of the question she dodged was about the deep state. You know why. Because there‚Äôs no facts, just based off of a conspiracy.
@GhostPsyborg @NumberO61435898 @JudgeJeanine @TheView Okay. What‚Äôs your show of choice?@seanhannity ‚Äòs show? Atleast the view has multiple points of view and not just one. And the view isn‚Äôt just all politics too.
@GhostPsyborg @NumberO61435898 @JudgeJeanine @TheView Umm legit the person most famous for doing this is @KellyannePolls and even if we do, it still doesn‚Äôt make Jeanine look any better.
@GhostPsyborg @NumberO61435898 @JudgeJeanine @TheView As in not answer the question by witching the subject.
@GhostPsyborg @NumberO61435898 @JudgeJeanine @TheView Nope, dead serious. See as someone who actually watches the view daily and not just when clips are all over Twitter, I know this has never happened to this extent.
@GhostPsyborg @NumberO61435898 @JudgeJeanine @TheView They only were ‚Äúscreaming‚Äù because she obviously was switching the question. The view has always been a show where everyone talks over each other and nothing has ever gotten this bad for the simple reason of they don‚Äôt attack the other people. Jeanine did the opposite of that
@Ummmmichelle @NumberO61435898 @JudgeJeanine @TheView No what had happened was judge Jeanine attacked Whoopi. Then Whoopi got mad but not screaming. She then collected herself and ask Jeanine a question and Jeanine totally switch the subject. That‚Äôs when Whoopi had to stop it.
@jjeffreys42 @splinter_news Really? So, Jeanine didn‚Äôt attack Whoopi by saying that she had ‚Äútrump derangement syndrome?‚Äù Or when sunny felt as though she was switching the subject she didn‚Äôt just ask nicely to stop interrupting her. She didn‚Äôt give sunny a death stare? I don‚Äôt know what you were watching
@Ummmmichelle @NumberO61435898 @JudgeJeanine @TheView I mean look at the last minute and you‚Äôll see that Whoopi asked Jeanine about the deep state and she switches it. And that‚Äôs just the last minute or so of the catastrophe.
@Ummmmichelle @NumberO61435898 @JudgeJeanine @TheView If you watched the show you would know that Jeanine kept on dodging questions.

@Troyk901 @KristiFryxell @splinter_news No what was rude was Pirro making personal blows at Whoopi. Pirro had an attitude the whole interview and if she didn‚Äôt want to be there she should have never scheduled the interview.
@jjeffreys42 @splinter_news It‚Äôs kinda hard to have a civil debate with someone who starts attacking you. I mean are you really that blind. Judge Jeanine was incredibly rude from the start of the interview and I don‚Äôt think there has ever been a guest on the show that acted the way she did.
@MGucci8 @Shawn_Phillips @splinter_news Saying that we got our brains ‚Äúout of a Cracker Jack box‚Äù just contradicts your statement and shows how narrow minded you are.
@Theresaluvshoe @splinter_news If you actually watch the view, she never acts like that. Judge Jeanine was incredibly rude to start out with and she was dodging questions. Their job is to get people to answer the questions and if judge Jeanine doesn‚Äôt like that then maybe she shouldn‚Äôt have come on the show.
@KristiFryxell @splinter_news Judge Jeanine dogged a bunch of question and she was incredibly rude. She looked like she didn‚Äôt know what she was doing.

Just because you believe that there are bad cops doesn‚Äôt mean you don‚Äôt support law enforcement.

@AllForOne78 @mrc3623 @MStoehrer @BeckysTidePods @SenWarren @WeymouthPD @Northeastern Oh so now you guys are the ones saying that condolences are enough. What exactly do you want her to do. And what have people whose condolences that‚Äôd you take done differently?
@AllForOne78 @mrc3623 @MStoehrer @BeckysTidePods @SenWarren @WeymouthPD @Northeastern He has opened the eyes to the public that he only likes news that puts him in the best spotlight.
@AllForOne78 @mrc3623 @MStoehrer @BeckysTidePods @SenWarren @WeymouthPD @Northeastern It depends on what you‚Äôre actually watching on all.

@AllForOne78 @mrc3623 @MStoehrer @BeckysTidePods @SenWarren @WeymouthPD @Northeastern Look even if she didn‚Äôt necessarily support either does not mean she wants violence inflicted towards them.

@AllForOne78 @mrc3623 @MStoehrer @BeckysTidePods @SenWarren @WeymouthPD @Northeastern Trump does not just quote specifics.

@AllForOne78 @mrc3623 @MStoehrer @BeckysTidePods @SenWarren @WeymouthPD @Northeastern Being critical of a president has nothing to do with encouraging violence toward law enforcement.

I‚Äôm a little confused how you are trying to separate her and trump on who‚Äôs divisive because I know trump is divisive when he makes comments on reporters. And what about Milo? You completely ignored that part. Why?
@JET4AMERICANS @SenWarren @WeymouthPD Oh just like when trump decided to recognize the reporters who were killed in the capital gazette shooting? I guess it goes both ways. And if you actually listened to our message, you would know that we don‚Äôt hate law enforcement all together; just the bad ones.
@mrc3623 @MStoehrer @BeckysTidePods @SenWarren @WeymouthPD @Northeastern Also using your guys‚Äôs thinking. It could never be @SenWarren fault because she didn‚Äôt pull the trigger. Just like it could NEVER be the guns fault because it doesn‚Äôt pull the trigger. Idk just a thought.
@mrc3623 @MStoehrer @BeckysTidePods @SenWarren @WeymouthPD @Northeastern Unless you blame Milo Yiannopoulos, Donald Trump and everyone else who‚Äôs ‚Äúideology that puts these‚Äù reporters in danger every day on the Capital Gazette shooting, I don‚Äôt think you have the right to blame this on @SenWarren or anyone else except the shooter.

@socityjim @chitownshteller @TWforthepeople @Peter_Quinn1 @KamalaHarris This won‚Äôt be a consequence until at least after midterms. Mitch McConnell was clear and now were are just following there rules. This is what the GOP does. They say thing and then we play by their rules and they hate it. For example being ‚Äúpolitically correct‚Äù
@BklynDin @Millennial_Dems @cmclymer Now, I‚Äôm very very liberal but that does not mean that I‚Äôm going to vote for someone just because they vote my way. If they‚Äôre corrupt or they go against my morals that is more important. So I think you need to figure out if you actually have morals or not

@chitownshteller @socityjim @TWforthepeople @Peter_Quinn1 @KamalaHarris It‚Äôs not about having ‚Äúhigher standards‚Äù but trying to say that he has a bigger and more powerful say in this situation because it‚Äôs just plain out not true. He just has a different role
@chitownshteller @socityjim @TWforthepeople @Peter_Quinn1 @KamalaHarris 5) it is drawing it out of the realm of logic because it is getting rid of the Check and Balance that our Founding Fathers. Without it we would be a dictatorship. Now if you don‚Äôt see that they are arguing for this because trump wants to be a dictator then you can‚Äôt see treason
@chitownshteller @socityjim @TWforthepeople @Peter_Quinn1 @KamalaHarris Them that power to basically veto his nominee?) oh wait for check and balance... now if you get rid of this it‚Äôs against the constitution (quite ironic right?) 3) this midterm election is just as important as the general 4) you could say the same exact thing with President Obama
@chitownshteller @socityjim @TWforthepeople @Peter_Quinn1 @KamalaHarris 1) it‚Äôs a two part process and congress hold 1/2 of that so the president more important? 2) it doesn‚Äôt matter what they did in the pass because the constitution gives them the second part of the process. (You saying since they usually side with the president... then why give

@chitownshteller @socityjim @TWforthepeople @Peter_Quinn1 @KamalaHarris You said they were ‚Äúpractically irrelevant.‚Äù And if you would like to use that reasoning; you can‚Äôt pass a nominee without congress!

@chitownshteller @socityjim @TWforthepeople @Peter_Quinn1 @KamalaHarris Even if congress always decided with the president, the constitution gave them a say so they should have the same rules as the person nominating the justice!
@chitownshteller @socityjim @TWforthepeople @Peter_Quinn1 @KamalaHarris Okay, no where though in the constitution does it say one has a bigger say then the other. So historical or not it may be unconstitutional! I mean things shouldn‚Äôt be decided of historical but instead on now!

@jcrhea @TWforthepeople @Peter_Quinn1 @KamalaHarris My bad I read your last post wrong. What I am saying is to my knowledge none of the justices currently are biased.
@jcrhea @TWforthepeople @Peter_Quinn1 @KamalaHarris Oh please you only say that because they tend to read the constitution differently then the right. There‚Äôs a difference between interpretation and being biased
@chitownshteller @socityjim @TWforthepeople @Peter_Quinn1 @KamalaHarris Again even if the president is ‚Äúmore important‚Äù in this, in the constitution it says they have a voice too. The Merrill garland ‚ÄúBiden rule‚Äù doesn‚Äôt say any nominee shouldn‚Äôt be appointed and it also wouldn‚Äôt apply to Obama‚Äôs situation since it was not considered summer
@jcrhea @TWforthepeople @Peter_Quinn1 @KamalaHarris Yes biased and again it was just an example. Justices are suppose to not be biased toward there political beliefs and only supposed to make rulings accordingly to the constitution
@chitownshteller @socityjim @TWforthepeople @Peter_Quinn1 @KamalaHarris No a lot of people voted for him for the simple fact of they thought he was the lesser of two evils. And congress still is relevant in having a new justice unless you know you don‚Äôt care about the constitution. Kinda ironic I would say.
@lindaorgill Yes! This was never a rule. Why would it ever be a rule. And I would somewhat be fine if you guys waited to nominate a justice until after midterms, but no that‚Äôs the opposite of what you guys are doing. You know why? You guys are scared of the #BlueWave #MidtermsBeforeSCOTUS
@lindaorgill lol just like if it was Mitt Romney picking the nominee the GOP would have never made up this fake rule
@chitownshteller @socityjim @TWforthepeople @Peter_Quinn1 @KamalaHarris A logical distinction between what? The two elections. Yeah they‚Äôre different yet both sides elected are IMPORTANT to getting a new SC Justice
@jcrhea @TWforthepeople @Peter_Quinn1 @KamalaHarris I mean I personally can‚Äôt compare them at the same level because he didn‚Äôt make up this fake rule and say he wouldn‚Äôt pass anyone no matter what.
@jcrhea @TWforthepeople @Peter_Quinn1 @KamalaHarris To be fair Schumer did say unless there is ‚Äúextraordinary circumstances‚Äù. So analyzing what he‚Äôs saying he didn‚Äôt say that he just wouldn‚Äôt approve anyone. Maybe he had a reason like could have thought Bush would nominate biased people. Not defending just analyzing
@chitownshteller @socityjim @TWforthepeople @Peter_Quinn1 @KamalaHarris Okay you keep comparing it to 2010. Let me set the scene. America didn‚Äôt have the rule ‚Äúno nominee on an election year‚Äù yet and also the republicans didn‚Äôt have a majority in either part of congress. I mean when Mitch made his comments he didn‚Äôt just say presidential elections
@chitownshteller @socityjim @TWforthepeople @Peter_Quinn1 @KamalaHarris Oh please this election is probably one of the biggest we‚Äôve had here in America for decade due to all this tension. They aren‚Äôt different because although it‚Äôs the president who nominated them, who‚Äôs the one actually approving these nominees. The right make up rules as they go
@jcrhea @TWforthepeople @Peter_Quinn1 @KamalaHarris Hypocrisy is hypocrisy no matter what side it comes from. And right now the GOP is a big group of hypocrites. And please site a source backing up your claim about Schumer.
@viktorhardesty @theHiRiseLA 1) ever heard of the saying 2 wrongs don‚Äôt make a right? 2) aren‚Äôt they trying to get out of that country?

@viktorhardesty @theHiRiseLA Wait did you really just comment on someone making a spelling mistake and then use a picture of Trump? Oh the irony has never been this real!
@jcrhea @TWforthepeople @Peter_Quinn1 @KamalaHarris Our side is only ‚Äúlosing‚Äù because conservatives stole a seat on the Supreme Court from us. Then they want to go against exactly what there reasoning was for doing so.
@socityjim @TWforthepeople @Peter_Quinn1 @KamalaHarris Yeah the difference was that Obama was robbed a nominee pick because it was an  ‚Äúelection year‚Äù yet here we are closer to an election and republicans want to push through a pick before the election.

@McV15866043 @mflynnJR Just because 70-90% of people plead guilty before trail does not mean they didn‚Äôt do it.

@AionHoochi @mflynnJR If you are innocent though, you would know that there‚Äôs no evidence against you. Now guilty people‚Äôs mindsets are that they will be able to prove it.
@TimothyFyock @mflynnJR You say this acting like Michael Flynn didn‚Äôt have money for a good defense. If your innocent, then you would know there‚Äôs no evidence against you to charge you, no matter how high the charge is.

You don‚Äôt know for sure though because the person wasn‚Äôt specific. Trump should be specific he‚Äôs our president.

@shelleypohl @KristinaSulkow1 @JonathanIDixon I can‚Äôt agree with either of you guys because (if you would like to get out the convo on google and follow along) he wasn‚Äôt asked a question on MS-13 the person stated a fact.

@GTAGamingiF @StDaphne @TheDailyDish2 @mikelcal @CentexActionNet It would still be harder to get. It could stop some criminals from getting their hands on these guns which would save some lives. Am I missing something or no
@TheDailyDish2 @mikelcal @CentexActionNet @TheDailyDish2 so what your saying is laws don‚Äôt prevent anything? So why don‚Äôt we just boycott every law. Save us some money since we wouldn‚Äôt need police anymore
@joncoopertweets @Arbys @IngrahamAngle Honestly Arby‚Äôs is crap anyways so it‚Äôs not hard to boycott them
I love the shade that she‚Äôs always throwing... sometimes I think it would be an honor to have her throw shade at you https://t.co/efpYa1jfef

@HarryMCMLVIII @spayer @999maxx999 @realDonaldTrump Lol okay... good businessmen don‚Äôt fail at most things... at least say he is a mediocre businessmen but not good or great... and if he wants to run america like his businesses then how do we not know if it‚Äôs another one of the bankruptcies of his businesses
@HarryMCMLVIII @realDonaldTrump Wait why would we not only go against what we believe in but also something that is like by the minority of America? This is legit your way of saying we should always side with you guys smh nice try
@spayer @HarryMCMLVIII @999maxx999 @realDonaldTrump For real... how many times did he go bankrupt or his business?
@HarryMCMLVIII @spayer @999maxx999 @realDonaldTrump Honestly I think you‚Äôre not hearing yourself... they came here for a better life... they are here because they are gettin a better life... @spayer was just trying to tell you that they do pay taxes and get less than you do... but you would know that if you did research
@HarryMCMLVIII @spayer @999maxx999 @realDonaldTrump What about California? Get over that crap thinking trump would have won it in any situation... and my point was that you want more taxes for the wall and trump is not giving all he‚Äôs got so... and what happened to ‚ÄúMexico is going to pay for the wall‚Äù
@spayer @HarryMCMLVIII @999maxx999 @realDonaldTrump I keep forgetting that I can‚Äôt expect to get anything more than this out of the right... probably because they don‚Äôt do their research ever
@HarryMCMLVIII @spayer @999maxx999 @realDonaldTrump You realize DACA recipients can‚Äôt vote and they pay taxes... in fact people who even aren‚Äôt DACA recipients still pay taxes smh but if we want to talk about taxes maybe you should look in trumps direction and see he went through loopholes
@HarryMCMLVIII @spayer @999maxx999 @realDonaldTrump Lol no I‚Äôm just saying you would be deporting Jesus out with the rest if he was alive rn
@HarryMCMLVIII @spayer @999maxx999 @realDonaldTrump I would like to remind you that Jesus was a refugee and to say yours going to ban refugees on the day of Jesus‚Äôs resurrection is saying you don‚Äôt care about Jesus kinda
@_rammanohar @SoonerRice @DrumpftrumpS @thebradfordfile @realDonaldTrump I mean can we really expect any more from the right?
@meansplace50 @realDonaldTrump Yes because people who are contributing to society should be punished for there parents wrong-doing ... makes so much sense
@spayer @999maxx999 @realDonaldTrump The only wall that taxpayers want to pay for is in trumps prison cell
@RedPillKen @realDonaldTrump You do realize that DACA recipients work and have high school diplomas and pay taxes etc. legit they do more than some people who are Americans... go complain about those people

@SEANTHOMAN @CoreyLMJones Lol if anything he doesn‚Äôt do that... you guys get made when he decides he wants to throw heat at the person throwing it at him... for example the @IngrahamAngle situation
@Kahne5Fan @thingsmymomma @theMichele526 @CoreyLMJones If your gonna stick to that logic do it for the whole time and not just when it benefits you because you think he shouldn‚Äôt be allowed in politics because he‚Äôs ‚Äúto young‚Äù yet you‚Äôll thrash on him constantly just saying STOP BEING A HYPOCRITE!
@CoreyLMJones @GUSMAR80 Legit David Hogg and Emma Gonzalez has gotten death threats too... don‚Äôt act like it‚Äôs just you... also, they do take the heat... but they also turn it around on the person who deserves it like @IngrahamAngle
@GUSMAR80 Lol so we aren‚Äôt suppose to speak out until we are considered victims in your eyes? If your definition of a ‚Äúmedia whore‚Äù is someone that is trying to change America than I‚Äôm one, your one, you voted for one... everyone in politics would be considered one
@mathewlenning @jlynne5257 @RagingGayCons No where in here does it talk about how the left listens to CNN the most or how CNN is the worst new station... it does say that the news talked about Hillary scandals more than trump scandals and it talked about trump views more than Hillary‚Äôs so...

@Vengeance_X2 Lol yes because I‚Äôm the one who thinks everyone can afford their medical bills because I live in a fantasy world... sorry but not everyone is as ‚Äúfortunate‚Äù as you... except I‚Äôd choose to be poor than ignorant any day of the year

@LadyPat18 @Jack67777 @ConservGayGuy Always love when people turn the argument onto my followers... if you can‚Äôt debate on what i said then clearly I won this debate and me talking to you any longer is useless so goodbye... I hope you have a lovely evening
@ThisGuy_NotSure @IAmKateSteinle But see the thing is... that wasn‚Äôt directed towards wrong doing of whites... it was directed to wrong doings of a country... it wasn‚Äôt asking for whites to be punished... it was asking for a nation to be punished... no one has specific asked for whites to be punished
@LadyPat18 @Jack67777 @ConservGayGuy STOP MAKING ASSUMPTIONS... in fact I usually tend to watch more fox... I also get news from senators and representatives and even trump.... So stop using Media outlets to defend your arguments... if that‚Äôs all you can say on that then clearly I am right so......
@ThisGuy_NotSure @IAmKateSteinle I‚Äôm not saying anything really if there‚Äôs white privilege or anything but like I said I‚Äôve never hear anyone say that whites should be punished... you didn‚Äôt prove that has happened so I still haven‚Äôt heard anything like that
@ThisGuy_NotSure @IAmKateSteinle I never said that... i just said that it was never out for the ‚Äúwhites‚Äù and it was addressing the country... you claimed basically that they were saying whites owe blacks... also they said that it is because of slavery and the way they are treated now and because of disadvantages
@Time_to_riseup @ConservGayGuy @IAmKateSteinle Look at genesis 19:8, it is digusting and tries to make rape okay... look every book is flawed when it comes to religion... most people don‚Äôt follow every single thing in their religion... so in your reasoning though Christianity is an ideology and not compatible with anything
@ThisGuy_NotSure @IAmKateSteinle I never said white privilege existed I simply said what I‚Äôve heard them talk about... this is only one instance and that isn‚Äôt saying oh every white person owes them it was more of our country owes them
@IAmKateSteinle @fmc21369 @Time_to_riseup @ConservGayGuy I know you didn‚Äôt make the comments but right before you asked him that question you liked a post saying ‚ÄúIslam not compatible with this country‚Äù so why does it bother you that people follow Islam... and I‚Äôm not saying @fmc21369 was right
@ThisGuy_NotSure @IAmKateSteinle Liberals don‚Äôt say that!!! I‚Äôve heard them talk about white privileged but never that someone should be punished
@Jack67777 @LadyPat18 @ConservGayGuy I‚Äôm sorry but you‚Äôre all over the place... 1) why does it matter that they are Muslim because to me I just see a gold star famil that trump mocked 2)do you find that refreshing??? Cuz I don‚Äôt 3) when did we start talking about Nancy Pelosi? We were talking about trumo
@IAmKateSteinle @fmc21369 @Time_to_riseup @ConservGayGuy Why does it bother you that people believe in Islam??? I mean you just like a reply saying it isn‚Äôt compatible so let me ask you too why?
@Time_to_riseup @ConservGayGuy @IAmKateSteinle No... you just don‚Äôt believe in the religion... and if you republicans are so for the constitution then your should read the 1st amendment because it does say freedom of religion, not only religions Christians find compatible... also why does it make it not compatible???
@LadyPat18 @Jack67777 @ConservGayGuy I‚Äôm sorry but most of us don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs refreshing to see someone mock a reporter or anyone with a disability, call a widow of a soldier a liar, or criticize and belittle a gold star family
@LadyPat18 @Jack67777 @ConservGayGuy Umm let‚Äôs see... Mexico paying for the wall, how many attended his inauguration, releasing his tax returns, his state of the Union rating, etc... don‚Äôt think that he‚Äôs never lied cause he does it all the time and gets caught in it
RT @joncoopertweets: Trump is blocking release of the Democratic memo that will expose GOP lies and obstruction of the Russia probe. Althou‚Ä¶

@NE_Common_Sense @Freezesarah The difference is that he is the President... He works for us the people... the minute he was sworn in, every part of his life was now the American people‚Äôs life. He claimed that if he ran for office he‚Äôd show his taxes-Lies- if he has nothing to hide then he should‚Äôve showed it
@LadyPat18 @Jack67777 @ConservGayGuy Oh so she would be doing exactly what trump is doin right now? At least she wouldn‚Äôt have her cabinet and aides coming and goin like this admin. or she would be 100x more presidential. Look I‚Äôm not saying she‚Äôs the best, I‚Äôm just saying she was definitely the lesser of two evils
@LadyPat18 @Jack67777 @ConservGayGuy What politician isn‚Äôt... and that‚Äôs not even what I was arguing... he was trying to say that Americans don‚Äôt think Trump is dishonest just because he was elected... which is far from the truth
@Jack67777 @ConservGayGuy @LadyPat18 My point is just because he was elected doesn‚Äôt mean people think he is a model person or anything
@Jack67777 @ConservGayGuy @LadyPat18 I‚Äôm not the one implying that honesty is decided by elections. I pointed out how flawed your reasoning was... you said ‚ÄúIf we thought Trump was dishonest, we wouldn‚Äôt have chosen him!‚Äù I know there were people who only voted for him because they thought it was better than Hillary
@cherd65 Sadly it does
@cherd65 @Time_to_riseup @ConservGayGuy @IAmKateSteinle See that is more reasonable to argue about... I just hate when I see someone say Obama is a Muslim as if that itself is a bad thing when it‚Äôs not
@cherd65 @Time_to_riseup @ConservGayGuy @IAmKateSteinle Agreed... I just think that Obama wouldn‚Äôt lie about being Christian... I mean it is silly to do that... there would be no reason... I mean you can question everyone about what religion they believe in but that would be silly
@cherd65 It probably could make overdoses go down even more... but legalizing it is a start to the end of this horrible crisis... but like I said in the post... legalizing it won‚Äôt stop it but it is somewhere to start
@cherd65 @Time_to_riseup @ConservGayGuy @IAmKateSteinle No you came into a convo that was talking about someone saying Obama‚Äôs a Muslim when he isn‚Äôt... then you called me not credible because I said he wasn‚Äôt Muslim... and whatever you say I‚Äôm still going to think trump is a Muslim
@cherd65 @Time_to_riseup @ConservGayGuy @IAmKateSteinle I‚Äôm lacking in credibility because I told it how it is? Obama isn‚Äôt a Muslim... he is a Christian... again there is nothing wrong with being Muslim anyways... STOP USING IT AS AN INSULT OR A BAD THING! Now stop being a hypocrite by not wanting fake news and then being fake news
@Jack67777 @ConservGayGuy @LadyPat18 That still doesn‚Äôt explain why you would claim that someone is honest just because they were elected as a government official... I mean like I said Obama was elected twice so does the make him x2 as honest? I mean Russia elected Putin... is he honest?
@Time_to_riseup @ConservGayGuy @IAmKateSteinle I‚Äôm sorry but he isn‚Äôt Muslim... and even if he was there isn‚Äôt anything wrong with it... if you‚Äôre for the constitution look at the 1st amendment... also Pence and trump lean Christian #Constitution #hypocrite #1stAmendment
@Jack67777 @ConservGayGuy @LadyPat18 You said that if we thought Trump was dishonest we wouldn‚Äôt have chosen him as president... then you said Obama‚Äôs was dishonest... but wasn‚Äôt he elected 2? You reasoning is faulty for sayin Trump is honest... He lies constantly #NeverTrump #Impeach #dictator #TrumpCrash
@realbevscheer @Morrison7Rhonda They are only drama because you make them drama when them being transgender doesn‚Äôt effect you... it isn‚Äôt mental issues... it just may go against your beliefs... see though you can‚Äôt use that argument because it‚Äôs trying to make a fact out of hearsay you read in a book
@bwtanker @CoreyLMJones @BrandonJLandry You sure love thinking that DACA recipients can vote... well they can‚Äôt... and if your made about voter fraud then you should be mad at Trump for lifting sanctions on Russia #sanctions #DNC #Russia #RussianSanctions

@TheFreedomFan Also don‚Äôt say that there isn‚Äôt such things as nazis, white supremacists, kkk members, and racists out there... have you ever read up on the person Arthur Jones... you might want to if you think racism is gone
@TheFreedomFan Okay legit the Affirmative Action is to level out the playing fields for minorities so it‚Äôs legit more equal... secondly they did mention equal pay but I mean everyone should be paid the same for the same job... that is not politics just common sense
@TheFreedomFan NO WHERE IN THE COMMERCIAL DID IT SAY ANY OF THAT!!!! You might have interpreted that (probably because the right thinks the left is always out to get them) and are you saying the government should let discrimination happen?
@TheFreedomFan Legit all this commercial was about is that everyone is created equal... it did say that some people will tell them otherwise (which is true) I mean if your not for equality for everyone are you really ‚Äúmaking America great again‚Äù
@TMobile @kerrywashington Okay I legit posted this and then kept on scrolling through T-Mobile‚Äôs twitter to see that it is her voice lol love her though
@TMobile Idk why but I hear @kerrywashington voice narrating this but maybe it‚Äôs because I‚Äôve been watching to much scandal
If you are against the #TMobile ad then you clearly made it political yourself or your against America for the Declaration of Independence says ‚Äúall men are created equal‚Äù and legit this is what the commercial is reinforcing #Constitution #democracy #HumanRights #politics

States with legal medical marijuana... Wake up America! The legalization of marijuana is helping the opioid crisis... I‚Äôm not saying this is the complete answer to our problem but it‚Äôs a start! #MedicalMarijuana #opioidcrisis #TrumpSOTU #Republicans

I am tired of hearing republicans say they are trying to fight the opioid problem... if they were actually doing so they would be legalizing marijuana... Colorado, a state that has legalized recreational marijuana, had a 6% decrease in fatal opioid overdoses in the first 2 years
@DuszaLukasz Love how republicans are like ‚Äúoh you need to respect trump...blah blah blah‚Äù yet they don‚Äôt respect us... they constantly attack and say someone is unamerican because of what party they support... also don‚Äôt make statement if you have nothing to back it up #StateofOurUnion

@LisaFrazier5 @lickemjkazz @lucy_two @DougSides You say that it‚Äôs Democrats want things yet the top 5 poorest states are republican states that get food stamps (btw nothing wrong with it) so when you say it is only Democrats that do nothing and want things handed to them remember that

@lickemjkazz @lucy_two @LisaFrazier5 @DougSides Don‚Äôt waste your breath @lucy_two trumpers don‚Äôt believe anything unless it‚Äôs from fox new or trump... probably why they‚Äôre misinformed all the time
@tbailey5477 @tkearney922 @crosshrtd In trumps own words, it would be his fault and in 2013 he said it would never happen under his watch because he‚Äôs good at negotiating yet fast forward 5 years... trump and most of American blame republicans and trump

@Miknmic96 @KamalaHarris It is arguably a democratic-republic consider in a republic you would have elected officials make all the decisions... we have that for the whole country but when it comes to states it‚Äôs more of a Democratic-Republic... also read this for the whole Americans don‚Äôt want DREAMERS

@Miknmic96 @KamalaHarris America is a democratic-republic; we vote on some things or we have our leaders make the decision. Even if California would‚Äôve voted it would‚Äôve been the same outcome... and most Americans do support DACA just because they need 60 votes doesn‚Äôt mean they don‚Äôt have the majority
@DonaldJTrumpJr This clearly was to show that she was being hypocritical to ‚Äúkneelers‚Äù for she disrespected the flag because according to the flag code... this wasn‚Äôt a you‚Äôre being a bad persona or disrespecting the flag... it was more of a you‚Äôre a hypocritical stupid ignorant
@SenateMajLdr This is the republican party‚Äôs way of pushing DACA back to the bottom of their list until it is to late... we shouldn‚Äôt have to pick between either and we shouldn‚Äôt be leaving things until the last minute... these are human life‚Äôs of both sides not bargaining chips
@realDonaldTrump Fake new? You are the fake news... but go back a couple days to you saying the Obama‚Äôs admin. Sold and move the London embassy when it was the Bush Admin. This is just one recent example and you constantly are saying things that are wrong
@thiafinart @LizabethSTucker @Jacquel25102704 @realDonaldTrump And keep talking about how us liberals are ‚Äúseparating the country‚Äù yet look exactly what you guys are doing
@thiafinart @LizabethSTucker @Jacquel25102704 @realDonaldTrump For all you guys saying I hope California secedes and all that crap-there are other states that share our beliefs and more people in the United States share our beliefs so if we all seceded you‚Äôd lose a lot of wealth, have no health coverage, and have only poor hillbillies
@realDonaldTrump You constantly attack the media for being fake and lying yet you are only distracting America to hide the fact that you are the fake news outlet that Trump supporters get their sources from
@realDonaldTrump It honestly makes no sense 1)bush admin. Sold it 2)the money they got from the old property was enough to pay for the new one 3) the old property was deemed vulnerable to a terrorist attack #research #TrumpIsRacist #coward
@Coach2Tags @JeffMacias @foxandfriends @KellyannePolls @POTUS 1) if other polls were wrong... how do you know these aren‚Äôt? 2) if they need to stay silent because they‚Äôre to embarrassed to be a trump supporter then maybe they should reconsider
@maxhampl ‚ÄúNo taxation without representation‚Äù because you should and this is key to this argument... and when this famous saying was trending the government (England) ending up losing the battle  and loosing more then what they would of lost if they just gave them representation
@maxhampl Because although they might make more... both parties are still working hard and trying to provide for family and they have a say if they are still paying taxes because then it‚Äôs like the government taking you money without a say... have you heard the saying...
@maxhampl Okay so I search and read quite a bit... I didn‚Äôt really find anything on individuals but if you look at state by state... you will find democratic states typically pay more, but that‚Äôs doesn‚Äôt mean democrats pay more... I believe though that it can‚Äôt be based on that...

I‚Äôm here to have an actually political conversation. I‚Äôve looked at my response and have said my bad.

I have simply corrected myself in calling him out
@World_War_Plain @zacharywathen97 @shanegibson97 @Chris_calimano @HoesNot4Me @fabtibby @murrayjohnsonjr @wesCarlson_ @Matt_Haralson @Jc409John @Candykizz69 @SqueekTheMayor @realDonaldTrump @foxandfriends 3) I really don‚Äôt think people hate the flag I believe they just feel as though this country has taken the wrong turn 4) I personally believe in history for if you don‚Äôt learn it, it will repeat. But our history wasn‚Äôt always pretty at times. 5)add stricter gun laws to your list
@World_War_Plain @zacharywathen97 @shanegibson97 @Chris_calimano @HoesNot4Me @fabtibby @murrayjohnsonjr @wesCarlson_ @Matt_Haralson @Jc409John @Candykizz69 @SqueekTheMayor @realDonaldTrump @foxandfriends 1) I feel this is very one sided even though the right don‚Äôt want to pay the price either but I could be interpreting it wrong. 2) I feel as though people think the left hates cops which isn‚Äôt the case. We don‚Äôt like the ones who commit crimes.

@shanegibson97 @Chris_calimano @HoesNot4Me @fabtibby @murrayjohnsonjr @wesCarlson_ @Matt_Haralson @Jc409John @Candykizz69 @SqueekTheMayor @realDonaldTrump @foxandfriends I never said your view points were bad. I believe that the left and right want the same things but I they want to achieve them different ways. I want a safe environment and I hope you do too, and my bad for calling you out for spelling for sometimes I get ahead of myself
@shanegibson97 @Chris_calimano @HoesNot4Me @fabtibby @murrayjohnsonjr @wesCarlson_ @Matt_Haralson @Jc409John @Candykizz69 @SqueekTheMayor @realDonaldTrump @foxandfriends First of if your going to get in an argument spell things correctly like allow because it makes you seem lbot like a credible source. Second off if you can‚Äôt fly in a plane, then you shouldn‚Äôt be allowed to own a gun. We aren‚Äôt taking mentally stable, good working citizens guns.
@realDonaldTrump 1) if you are such a genius you would realize climate change is real and you would‚Äôve known that Hawaii gives out live birth certificates instead of birth certificate but you didn‚Äôt... and to add you would know that Puerto Rico is a US territory, etc 2) you ran in 2000
@JessicaLBrown38 @TheRealJuIian You damn idiot... they clearly don‚Äôt like pedophiles more... it‚Äôs not what they liked but who was a better choice based on morals... I didn‚Äôt like Clinton all that much but yet I would‚Äôve voted for her if I could... and I can tell you Moore didn‚Äôt win cause he officially lost
@realDonaldTrump Sounds like he wants us to become a dictatorship and you should only believe what he says... cuz you know he knows everything and hasn‚Äôt been a fake news source ever *sarcasm* ... next thing you know he‚Äôll block all of television except FOX
#TranslateASayingOrQuote ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not a racist, but...‚Äù = ‚ÄúI own a tiki torch and an AK-47. Oh and I also have a sign saying ‚ÄòAll Lives Matter‚Äô in the car just in case of an emergency.‚Äù
@josephMAGA1776 @realDonaldTrump 1) any good judge is not fired twice from their state‚Äôs Supreme Court and accused of sexual harassment 2)you can call it a conspiracy but clearly the people who hate ‚Äúfake news‚Äù believed it wasn‚Äôt 3) have you ever heard the saying ‚Äúyou win some and you lose some‚Äù
@josephMAGA1776 @realDonaldTrump 1) you called him a good person and then said he is a pedophile in the same sentence 2)intense liberal bias? What do you mean 3) there isn‚Äôt any ANTI-TRUMP BIAS among the Alabama voters considering they helped elect him
@josephMAGA1776 @realDonaldTrump Okay I have a question... have you ever said ‚Äúobviously it didn‚Äôt matter to the victims to much since they‚Äôre just coming out now‚Äù or something along those lines?
@josephMAGA1776 @realDonaldTrump I‚Äôm sorry but there are so many things wrong with that tweet but I couldn‚Äôt stop laughing at the part that you retweeted you own tweet and liked it... also pointing out you were the only one to do so #GetALife your trying to make it look like people were agreeing with youüòÇ
@josephMAGA1776 @realDonaldTrump ‚ÄúANTI-TRUMP BIAS‚Äù? #republicanlogic rep. Loses shouldn‚Äôt concede and should be investigated for fraud but nothing to support it... Democrat (HILLARY) loses... concedes not good enough there is stuff pointing to fraud and collusion but shouldn‚Äôt be investigated #Hypocrisy

@HillaryClinton @timkaine No wonder why Hillary Clinton didn‚Äôt win the election. Not only is she not the best person out there but she didn‚Äôt even pick the best running mate. Tim Kaine couldn‚Äôt even vote with the party that was suppose to elect him as Vice President.

@VaMercedeslady @AMike4761 @rdickens31 @VaMercedeslady How do you think you‚Äôre ‚Äúwinning,‚Äù the Democrats have made a huge comeback in special elections since Donald Trump has been elected... what also shows that we, Democrats, are winning is Donald trumps approval rating at a new low of 32%
@CattHarmony No what happened was the jurors were right by not convicting him considering it was involuntary manslaughter not first degree murder... also him being an illegal immigrant really has nothing to do with the incident cause it doesn‚Äôt change how the justic system views murders
@redpillwars Listen... the Democratic Party didn‚Äôt do it... it was her. Secondly, one does not discredit the other 6... just because one is caught in a lie doesn‚Äôt mean the others are... Also, maybe you favorite person, Donald Trump, shouldn‚Äôt have said he wanted a pedophile over a Democrat

@redpillwars So no if Roy Moore is that close to becoming a senator then it isn‚Äôt enough republicans coming out against him... and his poll numbers also went up when Trump showed approval of him
@redpillwars 1) a poll that was taken found that 49% of Democrats think Mr. Franken should resign, 67% say he should be subject to an official senate investigation, and only 25% say he shouldn‚Äôt resign 	2) Roy Moore is up in the polls somewhere around 48%... 23% more support that Al Franken
@redpillwars Sorry it‚Äôs actually 7 people
@redpillwars 4 have accused Roy Moore. Why hasn‚Äôt he stopped running for senate? Why are the Republicans supporting him? #NoExcuse
@starlady24 @Jurnee1999 @TallahForTrump @CNN @TheDemocrats How can you say we only have words... we have accusations that are being pursued... all you have on say Matt Launer is 1 accusation (15 less than Trump) and we don‚Äôt even know how credible the source is... also if Trump didn‚Äôt say it then why would he say he did???
@SherriDeford @GOP @DNC @POTUS Really not for school debt? Well why don‚Äôt they want to lower tuition? For safety? Why don‚Äôt they ever want to talk about gun reform? And for family? Why do they back a man who‚Äôs running for Congress who has been accused of having inappropriate behavior will minors?
@ColumbiaBugle @realDonaldTrump @POTUS The wealthy Americans are not the only Americans... the GOP tax plan will raise taxes for the middle class in the long run... so both parties are for high taxes except Democrats want the higher taxes for the people who can afford it unlike Republicans #GOPTaxReformScam
@BillieCotter @WallStPoker @Episcopalifem @BlueRobotDesign @JacobAWohl @realDonaldTrump High taxes???? This GOP tax plan is going to raise taxes for the middle class that is full of people having money problems... and the Obama admin. wanted to raise taxes for the rich who isn‚Äôt having a financial crisis
@realDonaldTrump Or the people who are not delusional and realize that it is raising taxes for the middle class. So when you Republicans say ‚Äúwe‚Äôre for lower taxes‚Äù are speaking about yourself and your rich friends? Cause actions speak louder than words #GOPTaxReformScam https://t.co/IdTreR4t6Z
@realDonaldTrump Are we okay? We are on the brink of nuclear war, have a mass shootings  (which feels normal about now), trying to pass a tax plan that is bad for the working class of America, and we still have you in office.Except these don‚Äôt hurt you #speakforyourself https://t.co/A8zsGHjJLM

@realDonaldTrump You know what else had a hard time getting an audience... your inauguration... you say the American public is fed up with the NFL but they were way fed up with you back in January about a year ago when u took office and it has just gotten worse #realnews https://t.co/TcS7GaE9yy

For all the Republicans or anyone that stands with @KellyannePolls for the issue on Roy Moore is disgusting... as long as she doesn‚Äôt pay her fair share in taxes or it‚Äôs not her daughter getting molested then it‚Äôs fine #kellyanneconway #GOPTaxPlan #RoyMoore #Republicans
