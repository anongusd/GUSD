@RealJamesWoods In essence, the State of CA grants contractor licenses to illegal immigrants who have undermined their employers. Then the State goes after their original employer (me) because I‚Äôm white, older, Christian, member of NRA, and independent non-union. They‚Äôve weaponized the CA CSLB!
@RealJamesWoods Then I find out they have applied to the CSLB for their own contractors license and the CSLB grants them a license! They steal tools and materials from the job site, and then go behind my back to many former customers and offer services...
@RealJamesWoods This wreaks havoc on all my bookkeeping. CA and Irs filings and deposits have to be retroactively corrected, etc. meanwhile they incite a mutiny and caused problems with jobs/customers, causing complaints against me from the CA contractors licensing board.
@RealJamesWoods I hired two illegal immigrants without knowing they were illegal. They gave me social security numbers on their applications that were fake. I am not allowed by law to verify their socials. One day they come in after working for me 3.5 years, and give me new social security no‚Äôs.
@RealJamesWoods Immigrants are cavalier about breaking American law. If they think breaking our laws is no big deal, what laws will they break once here. I‚Äôm not talking about the criminal element.  I have first hand experience with this ‚Äútrait.‚Äù They come from a land that expects corruption.

@TuckerCarlson Feinstein, Moonbeam, Waters, Schiff, Bescerra, Pelosi, Boxer, Eshoo, et al, are among the most nervous of politicians I‚Äôve ever seen. I wonder why. Their desperation is the dross rising to the top of the cauldron. Action should be taken now before CA‚Äôs collapse!
@TuckerCarlson  A ‚ÄúMarshall law‚Äù contingency plan should be developed in the event of the economic collapse of CA so that it doesn‚Äôt take down/cause a nationwide financial breach.  Dem‚Äôs desperation is partially rooted in CA‚Äôs fragility.
@TuckerCarlson I have many more examples that all can be rooted in inconsistent bad Dem policies adopted over the years that can‚Äôt be done in tweets! Suffice it to say that Dems are bent on tearing CA down. It‚Äôs the handwriting on the wall.
@TuckerCarlson another example is Oroville Dam the largest earthen dam in the US. Completed in early 70‚Äôs, the first time the dam reached full capacity its main and emergence spillways failed. Feds warned them of the problem but the state ignored it. It came too close to disaster
@TuckerCarlson consider the recent fires last year in the wine country, and this year in various places. Replacement costs of the destroyed homes exceeds the policy limits and they were insured at 1.5 times market value. Homeowners can‚Äôt rebuild!
@TuckerCarlson these conditions should be exposed now before the midterms because they are a clear undefendable reality and embarassment to Dems, who keep bragging about CA‚Äôs big powerful economy. The state can‚Äôt be carried by the tech giants.
@TuckerCarlson I believe that a CA economic collapse could significantly damage the Country and the only solution is to implement republican fiscal strategies designed to heal CA. It would still take time to fix the state. The bigger they are the harder they fall!
@TuckerCarlson I have deep background info going back to 1980 that illustrates liberal agenda implemented then resulting in the disaster that is now CA all from ‚Äúsocial engineering ‚Äú changes that can produce no other outcome than what we see now. Dems have literally ruined CA.
@TuckerCarlson A great effect would be for FOX to ‚Äúblitz‚Äù CA with all of the top anchors doing on location segments from various locations in CA. When citizens are leaving due to non/affordability, bad schools, and rampant drug abuse its a big problem.
@TuckerCarlson The economic disparity is the red flag that CA is headed for a collapse. The fed gov and other states should insulate themselves from this possibility. There is literally no affordability there, and still a steady influx of illegal immigrants.
@TuckerCarlson I think if you continue doing segments on CA‚Äôs filth and economic ‚Äúdiversity‚Äù that there are many Californians that are embarrassed at the condition of the state. It‚Äôs even getting harder for middle class homeowners to sell and leave.
@TuckerCarlson Thank you for your segment on CA. I was born and lived in CA 62 years. I moved to NV 3.5 years ago because I could no longer stand the way the state was being defaced/degraded. Infrastructure is exceeded. Dem Environmentalism seem to only apply to their targets.

@AMPRo1219 Flake says this is to bring the country together. What this country needs is decisiveness in stead of wishy-washy delays. Ok Jeff I understand your long-suffering desire for fairness, but watch what they‚Äôll try to do instead of what they say.
@AMPRo1219 Senator Flake should let his yes be yes and no be no. I fear that this will only open the door once again for the Dems to create new delays. This must be limited to only Ford/Kavanaugh and not these peripheral Debbie Ramirez, or Stormy Avenatti allegations.
@lynn_weiser Then they did it again at the end of the Ford/Kavanaugh hearing taking turns to push again for another delay using the FBI investigation ploy. Unfortunately, it falls on deaf ears now simply because of Feinsteins shameful antics.
@lynn_weiser Dr Ford was treated with great respect in the hearing. But the Dems single-handedly caused the loss of the benefit of an FBI investigation which they all came out of the gates screaming for after holding the letter until after the hearings were all but finished.
@lynn_weiser It‚Äôs no wonder America has lost trust in its government. It‚Äôs apparent the Dems are literally ‚Äúwhores for power‚Äù stooping to such lows for mere optics. America wants decency, law and order, and basic respect back.
@lynn_weiser What amazes me is Feinstein thinks her actions aren‚Äôt obvious to the public. It makes me worry about what she is getting away with that the public doesn‚Äôt know about. Shame on her. She should resign. All of her records should be opened for inspection by the public.
@lynn_weiser Ford lies about flying to suit herself. Apparently, in her mind she justifies this untruthfulness as she‚Äôs not afraid of flying if it‚Äôs a vacation! How convenient. Even her life long friend would stoop to ‚Äúwhite lie mode‚Äù Kavanaugh‚Äôs friends all back him,-Fords do not back her.
@lynn_weiser Having said that, I still am not sure if Ford was a Dem Hail Mary play, or a victim of some traumatic event in her past, but she is disingenuous switching from the 8yr old childish mode to PhD spewing her scientific expertise at will making me think she‚Äôs smart like a fox.
@lynn_weiser The Dems dropped the ball in the handling of Fords confidentiality. They did so for the sole purpose of delay. Fords attys perpetuated the delays and then cried for the FBI investigation not for justice but only more delays. A great disservice to Fords privacy.
@AMPRo1219 @JulieForeman16 The corroborating evidence of Dr Ford including her friend corroborates Kavanaugh. The other thing that jumps out at me is Feinstein leaking the letter. She denies it, but she didn‚Äôt exercise the extreme care she should have with that letter. It leaked during her care.
Best summary I‚Äôve read yet. I think the most weighty evidence was that her lifelong friend wouldn‚Äôt lie on her behalf, and instead corroborated Kavanaugh. I guess her friend did not want to be part of a lie. Ford, shifts from childish 8 yr old to technical PHD. Smart like a fox.

@unscriptedmike @CHIZMAGA @JeffFlake The ‚Äúold vestiges‚Äù of the dem party-Pelosi, Feinstein, Schumer, Blumenthal, Leahy, Waters, Harris, all must go. America wants basic respect, decency, and honesty back from its senators. Shame on the Dems in the judiciary committee.

@Patrici15767099 How shallow is Flake? Tell him to open his eyes. Show some actual common sense. Fords allegations aren‚Äôt even backed up by her own friends. Kavanaugh is totally qualified. All that Ford has done is make an allegation she or her friends can‚Äôt or won‚Äôt back up.
@patriotdame I think this circus today said more about Feinstein, And her merry band of con artists, than anything about Ford or Kavanaugh. After this, who wants to be a democrat. Feinstein et,al, has disgraced the Dem party.
@patriotdame I think Ford May have ‚Äúflown‚Äù to and from the party- she can‚Äôt remember. Most likely because no one will lie on her behalf and say they drove her. Too many unanswered holes in her story. This isn‚Äôt something the ‚ÄúFBI‚Äù would find.

@ComplicKate @Chris_Jorgensen @BillOReilly It‚Äôs not Kavanaugh‚Äôs place to ask for an investigation.

@BillOReilly I give weight to Fords close friend who wouldn‚Äôt testify on her behalf. She could have signed an affidavit and wouldn‚Äôt do that either. Mrs Ford said it was due to her friends health. An affidavit would have worked. I think her friend knew what Ford was doing and wanted no part.

@Patrici15767099 I was a fairly strict dad, and stayed as involved with my daughters in their endeavors as I could, but in the end it boils down to trust. I think somewhere along the line Mrs Ford had  her trust betrayed.  For some reason she‚Äôs made Brett her villian.
@Patrici15767099 But all it takes is for girls to not be on the invite list to a social event and they can be pretty vicious towards each other.
@Patrici15767099 I have two daughters and remember well that period in high school when they were 15-17. Somehow, I made it through that time, but I have a new understanding of the way girls that age behave. The gossip, and vengeful ways that girls will sometimes treat each other is palpable.
@ToscaAusten @gcain63 I think less of the dem committee members than Mrs Ford. I have great empathy for Mrs Ford. She has her own demons but I don‚Äôt think they‚Äôre Brett Kavanaugh. I hope she finds happiness in her life.
@Patrici15767099 Due to the avoidable last/minute antics and obvious delay tactics of the Dems, I have to give the confirmation to Judge Kavanaugh.
@Patrici15767099 On Kavanaughs side, hundreds of people from high school, college and career have vehemently supported Kavanaugh. The only other thing one can attack is the process itself. For sure I can‚Äôt reach where I‚Äôd believe that Diane Feinstein didn‚Äôt leak Fords Letter.
@Patrici15767099 I feel sorry for her, but her accusations are just that accusations. Her own alleged eye witnesses roll their eyes in the form of affidavits disagreeing with her and that there even was such a party.  This doesn‚Äôt rise to discredit Kavanaughs entire career.

@Cernovich I don‚Äôt think this ‚Äúevent‚Äù rises to traumatic to the point of living with this perceived incident for 35 years. She may have just not been included in certain social circles and resented that. Girls are girls especially teenage gossip social stuff.
@Cernovich Hypothetically, this could have been just teenagers horseplay and she may have taken it as an assault. She may have been a spoiled brat before the party...
@Cernovich In light of the fact everyone she said was at this party said this didn‚Äôt happen or never went to any such party, then she should have a much better recollection of who drove her either way. Keep in mind she wasn‚Äôt actually raped.
@Cernovich She should be able to remember who drove her to and from the party. C‚Äômon every ‚Äúvictim‚Äù of these kind of events remember details like the wall paper pattern. Seriously, I think she couldn‚Äôt get anyone to corroborate who took her to/from this party of 4-5 total people.
RT @kbogan256: @Cernovich Why the person(s) that took her to/from the party have not come forward. No corroborating evidence of her story.
@Cernovich Whenever Questions try to pin her down to specifics, she claims her confusion is due to her trauma or fears. She‚Äôs just too selective. At one point it was like she switched on her PhD to diagnose her anxiety, then went back into stupid child mode.
@Cernovich Fords date of polygraph was aug 7, yet she says she was interviewing Atty at the same time, but the test came to her and was set up by her Atty. Supposedly she was somewhere mid-Atlantic and flew in for the polygraph. So she comes off as coy.
@Cernovich Ford seems too childish and seems to play dumb for a PhD.  The whole afraid to fly in airplanes reveals that she is selective when it comes to justifying her actions. It also reveals the Dems delay strategy.

@pdabrosca @blanken01 @MichaelAvenatti Oops! Gee why am I not surprised? Oh I know; it‚Äôs because this comes from the sharp minds of the Stormy/Avenatti team where credibility and honor abounds.  Stormy provides the gang-rape idea and Avenatti works in sales...
@starcrosswolf @wachinunow And now these idiots want us to believe the ‚ÄúAvenatti/Stormy Angle...; 10 Gang-rape parties in which their client  who was from another town and 3 years older attended. Well this sounds like it originated in the Stormy world of sluts, drugs and perversion!

You might guess I‚Äôll be showing up to vote in the upcoming midterms along with every family member friend and neighbor I can invite to my get out and vote barbecue! Now that‚Äôs the AMERICAN way!
I think this Avenatti/Stormy/Drugged teens/gang rape scheme might be another good argument to build the wall if for no other reason to get a lot of the drugs out of the picture, as well as put some creepy scum lawyers out of business representing these scumbags.
Then you have this sleazey Atty Avenatti that brings so much credibility to the table. I‚Äôm really not sure who is worse, the sluts or their attorney trying to pretend they‚Äôre honorable and should be believed.
Hookers and drug addicts go hand in hand and are rife with perverted schemes to get money or more drugs. This just looks like another one of them. Maybe they have their facts mixed up with the whole Bill Cosby thing...
15 &amp; 17 yr old boys, in their circles, don‚Äôt come up with these ideas to go to another town and invite a 19 yr old to their gang-rape. It‚Äôs just too much of a reach if you can get past the gang rape idea to begin with. Note: Stormy always standing next to Avenatti cuz she wants $
I‚Äôm guessing Avenatti got this ‚Äúgang-rape‚Äù idea from Stormy the hooker Daniels. This is where ‚Äúslut thinking‚Äù is. The third accuser is probably more closely tied to Stormy than her high school. I‚Äôm trying to figure out- ‚Äú hey let‚Äôs go invite this 19 yr old to our gang-rape?

@Patrici15767099 @ChuckGrassley @LindsayGrahamSC thank you for seeing the Ford, et, al allegations as being a dem hit job designed to derail the Kavanaugh confirmation process.   Please do not allow any more slippage in the schedule. The allegations are engineered by political puppet masters.
@Patrici15767099 @ChuckGrassley It‚Äôs very clear to average Americans that this is a dem hit job designed to smear Kavanaugh‚Äôs good name. Americans are with you. It‚Äôs time republicans firm up and let our ‚Äúno‚Äù mean exactly that. We cannot and should not entertain any more discussion.
@Patrici15767099 @ChuckGrassley The committee should no longer tolerate late allegations  designed to delay the process especially ones orchestrated by leftist activists.
@Patrici15767099 @ChuckGrassley I understand your compassion to extend to Mrs Ford. However, her complaint now falls on deaf ears- it‚Äôs untimely &amp; not brought forth to the correct venue. Had she reported this to her local authorities at the time, there would be a record of it.
@Patrici15767099 Had these ‚Äúvictims‚Äù complained timely to the local authorities, there would be a record on file that would have shown up in one of his 6 FBI background checks. This is nothing more than a democratic hit job. Confirm Kavanaugh!
@Patrici15767099 Now the complaints come late and in a much more vague remembrance of the facts, and it‚Äôs not the fault of the accused. The ‚Äúvictims‚Äù put themselves in the position of this uphill battle by complaining to the wrong people at the wrong time.
@Patrici15767099 Democrats ignore the correct procedures to process their complaints. They should have filed timely police reports and we would not have these untimely requests for FBI investigations and such. It seems Dems never have time to do things properly and in the correct venue.

As painful as it may be, American will need to make direct and sometimes painful choices to stop the bleeding and allow time to heal its wounds. The heart of America will prevail having learned a tough lesson!
The ‚Äúout-exchange‚Äù of money misappropriated by corrupt politicians is directly proportional to the anger of average citizens towards those politicians and gov officials who partook in the money. It reached a point where the American people realized America was bleeding out!
If Obama or others are complicit in the misdeeds of Hilary, Americans will not be calmed until they are served justice. The days of politicians lining their pockets at taxpayers expense are over. ‚ÄúAmerica is a country of laws, not a country of men.‚Äù
I tweeted last year that the American people will not rest unless and until Hilary &amp; Bill Clinton are brought to justice. Americans are relentless in their persuit for Justice. Gov‚Äôt cannot restore trust with the people until this happens. As bad as it is, it must be done.

NATO is $40 B stronger and Putin knows this is a red line. Trump and Putin may have gained a kind of cooperative truce with respect to Syria/Iran/Korea. Prior to the summit, Trumps rhetoric was focused at decreasing nuclear proliferation, so that could be his endgame strategy.
As a candidate, he professed a ‚Äúdynamic economy‚Äù both domestically and in foreign policy.  I think the Summit was a test the waters, and as far as being confrontational towards Putin a temporary optics push. Let‚Äôs just watch as events unfold.
As Americans we can only watch and see the momentum develop that Trump has set in motion. He‚Äôs begun to align forces domestically, both politically and economically, and he‚Äôs doing the same with his foreign policy which still has action steps that are yet to fall into place.
There have been so many things Trump has said contrary to all, that turned out to be right. He‚Äôs in a position where he obviously has intel that no one else has, and I think he‚Äôs a master at how to leverage that info.
Trump is a master at negotiations, so I‚Äôll give him the benefit of the doubt while he lines up and formulates his strategy to take down Putin his way.
As far as election meddling, the IG report says meddling occurred, but had no effect on the outcome, ok if true, America dodged a bullit, and it should serve as a wake up call to install tamper-proof safeguards to the election system including detection &amp; reporting of anomalies.
Keep in mind there may be  smoking gun revelations to come from the Clinton server on topics the public may still be unaware of.
As far as the hack of Clinton‚Äôs pvt server, or the DNC, this remains to be revealed, and I have confidence this information exists somewhere -even if not in Russia. Possibly NK, China or other ‚Äúforeign actors‚Äù. It may still have political value to be released at opportune time.
The other ‚Äúnew news‚Äù is Putin‚Äôs allegation Re $400 Million of Russian money flowing into Clinton campaign. This could be a bombshell revelation, and poses so many questions, ie., where did this money originate, who were the perps, etc.
I think the most significant thing is what was mentioned by Trump Re the Nuclear arsenals being 90% between US &amp; Russia. This could be the big opportunity that Trump is targeting. If both countries reduced  their arsenals by 50% they would still be super powers but world is safer
There may be other concessions that Trump has gotten behind closed doors that will help the US vis-a-vis, Syria, NK, Iran, China, Ukraine, Crimea, etc., so we will have to watch because Trump always has an end game.
Trump is the big winner of the Helsinki meet. Trump is a negotiator and a great sandbagger! We will just need to wait and see what action/moves Trump takes when he‚Äôs back. It appears He‚Äôs given Putin enough rope to hang himself while on Trumps watch as opposed to a prior admin.

@HARRISFAULKNER the Russians hacked into the DNC computer! Why would you ask Adam Schiff how to deal with this. The DNC/Clinton was sloppy with their security. Adam Schiff is a clown.
@BillOReilly Anyone who listens closely would be able to discern the ‚Äúfluff, embellishment, and hype, from the actual generic story. The MSM networks seem to ‚Äúcherry-pick,‚Äù and then derive some wildly absurd inferences from the basic facts turning the news into something it isn‚Äôt about.
@BillOReilly They reported in a much more ‚Äúgeneric sense.‚Äù I think Fox News is one of the only networks reporting news. They have their ‚Äúversion of reporting,‚Äù but fact checking them proves more accuracy as compared to MSNBC, CNN, and other MSM networks where one must fact check everything.
@BillOReilly It was refreshing to see that difference in the news reporting. It‚Äôs quite subtle, and I don‚Äôt think it was intentional, but rather an effect of being out of their regular routine while on the road. Sometimes when people get out of their routine ‚Äúcomfort zone‚Äù things can happen!
