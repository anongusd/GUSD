@enza_melisi @funder Ok how much money is going into Democratic campaigns by planned Parenthood?
@AstiJesse @JohnFugelsang According to Susan Collins she said that Kavanaugh agrees that RvW is settled law
@enza_melisi @funder Exactly they don't legislate from the bench
@LisaG724 @JohnFugelsang 54-46 Republicans had a majority. Good luck convincing 14 Republicans confirming Garland
@funder Supreme Court doesn't make gun laws!!!
@funder Let's not. If I'm Grassley I'm growing a set and if ANY of my senators (Coons and Carper) interrupt I'm throwing them out
@AstiJesse @JohnFugelsang But your party was inclined to vote no regardless of who the pick is simply because you don't like who the President is
@LisaG724 @JohnFugelsang Quit pretending about it being about documents... It's all because Merrick Garland didn't get a hearing
@shastableus @JohnFugelsang Are we really upset because a judge loves... Baseball?!?! Seriously?!?! Fucking Democrats
@MarthaMoppy @JohnFugelsang We don't need their votes. We're the majority and there's not a damn thing you fuck faces can do about it

@votevets @BentleysQuest @NRA Well when you have an ARMED police officer who WORKS AT THE SCHOOL!!!!! and cowards out and fails to protect the students of said school which is his job btw
@mardavisrn @BrookeBCNN @JohnCornyn @realDonaldTrump Then you can't have freedom of speech on social media because the founding fathers didn't know Twitter would even exist. Btw define "assault rifle" Do you even know that the AR in AR-15 doesn't even stand for assault rifle?
@kimguilfoyle What angers me is that this could have been avoided if people ACTUALLY FOLLOWED PROTOCOL
@mardavisrn @BrookeBCNN @JohnCornyn @realDonaldTrump Because it's their right to. "Shall not be infringed"
@BrookeBCNN @JohnCornyn @realDonaldTrump How do you explain not one, not two, but THREE ARMED police officers who WORK AT THE SCHOOL refuse to go in and charge the shooter?!?!  Why are they there for? Stop blaming the @NRA
