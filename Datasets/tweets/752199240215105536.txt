I lost my Dad in 2006. He was an American soldier. A true patriot. A man of principals like @SenJohnMcCain. I‚Äôm thankful his name has never crossed the lips of trolls like @michellemalkin and I hate that @MeghanMcCain has to hear such garbage about her Dad. RIP Maverick. ‚ù§Ô∏è
Another year of @CPAC &amp; another disappointment. Folks like @michellemalkin don‚Äôt represent me &amp; I found her rhetoric around @SenJohnMcCain to be reprehensible. Have some respect. He did more for America than you could in 5 lifetimes. Republicans deserve better than you my dear.

Let‚Äôs see...we‚Äôve fought to keep families together on the border, but (@RedHenLex) treat those who vote differently with disrespect. We‚Äôve defended mothers who broke the law to protect their children, but attempt to embarrass a working mother (@PressSec) in front of her family.
We‚Äôve spent a lifetime denouncing the actions of business owners who refused service to black people bc they were ‚Äúdifferent‚Äù but it‚Äôs 100% OK to be intolerant of @PressSec just bc Stephanie Wilkinson @RedHenLex doesn‚Äôt like her boss. Welcome to the intolerant left.
Hitler hated Jewish people. Stephanie Wilkinson hates Republicans. Why encourage the actions of the @RedHenLex  towards @PressSec and denounce the actions of Nazis? Treating others w/ disrespect bc of differences is evil no matter what you dress it up as.
Went online to check out your website @RedHenLex but it‚Äôs missing a lot of content, just like your owner is missing a lot of class. Maybe you videoed @PressSec leaving gracefully last night to take notes on how to have class.
What‚Äôd you expect @RedHenLex? Did you think the @PressSec would throw a fit? Nah, she was raised better. I‚Äôm sorry you weren‚Äôt.

I don‚Äôt know @BethMooreLPM personally, though knowing she lives here in the Houston area somehow made our recent move here seem easier. I‚Äôve seen lately she‚Äôs faced some hard times and harsh words and as mad as that makes me for her, I just want to say I‚Äôm grateful for her. ‚ù§Ô∏è
