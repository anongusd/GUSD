“Our independent organization (@nhrcqatar) will condemn the #Qatari government if it accepts these demands from blockade nations: shutting down @AlJazeera &amp; extraditing #political opponents. This is fundamentally against #humanrights !” - Dr. Ali al-Marri https://t.co/VD3OHax347
“In regards to women’s rights, #Qatar has a few challenges. However, we are a #progressive society &amp; are making strides in incorporating women into positions of gov’t &amp; influence. We have #women on the #Shuracouncil and @nhrcqatar employs around 60 women.” - Dr. Ali al-Marri https://t.co/5yhxKaTht6
“The #Qatari gov’t has made tremendous strides due to both international &amp; internal pressure. We can see the results of our work. The International Labor Organization is no longer pursuing a suit against #Qatar &amp; is instead holding the nation as an example.” - Dr. Ali al-Marri https://t.co/jCfV2mYu8z
“For #migrant workers, we (@nhrcqatar) have been advocating for them as an organization since 2004. We have been requesting the #Qatari government to implement multiple changes in law to curtail violations of migrant rights.” - Dr. Ali al-Marri https://t.co/cZE2KoJKvQ
“I understand the stance of neutrality that is being held by the #US. However, I request that the US stands by the #Qatari people in the face of #humanrights violations.” https://t.co/rdOCSvl1on
“Property rights have been severely curtailed for #Qatari citizens who own property in neighboring #GCC states. Eliminating the #freedom of movement is fundamentally against the #humanrights of Qatari’s who are being targeted.” 	- Dr. Ali al-Marri https://t.co/IuWErhWGYV
