#HIV infection rates in #Philadelphia are 5 times higher then the national average. They are 2.9 times greater than that in communities of color. We NEED to build treatment clinics and create outreach programs to bring these rates down. #PHILADELPHIA DESERVES BETTER! #orsino2019
I have never been wealthy and have no desire to be. In fact, I pledge to give a large portion of my salary BACK to the community. Becoming part of the 1% is not my goal. #change #Philadelphia #orsino2019

#Philadelphia is a city that (once upon a time) had a complex ferry network serving commuters. As time progresses and the city grows, I think this #green mode of transportation is something we need to reexamine to relieve traffic congestion. #PublicTransportation #orsino2019
There is NOTHING impracticle about rooftop #urbanfarming. I envision highrises renting out space to farming co-ops using sustainable materials and growing methods to transform empty space into cornfields, pumpkin patches, and even fruit orchards! #GreenNewDeal #orsino2019 #philly
A major, modern vocational school is something this city is severely lacking! Maybe we partner with a few #laborunions and created an effective, large-scale apprenticeship program??? 	#Vocation #education #orsino2019 #Philadelphia
I plan to completely exempt #Teachers, #FirstResponders, and the poor from the #Philadelphia City Wage Tax. Also, people living below the poverty line and seniors on a fixed income will be exempted from paying property taxes. This will put more $ in people's pockets!! #fairshare
Part of #Philadelphia's problems stem from the fact that our elected officials are mostly UNACCESSIBLE to the public. How can our concerns be listened to in a timely manner if you have to make an appointment weeks in advance to speak to someone? Let's #change that! #orsino2019
I wanted to take a moment and say thank you for all the positive and constructive feedback we are getting from the community. Open communication is one of the greatest tools we have to ensure YOUR VOICE is heard and I can formulate policies around what YOU want. #orsino2019
When elected I plan to be one of the most accessible Council members in history. I would like to be in them community constantly and I want to hear from people so I know what they want. Being a member of the Council isn't about serving my interests: it's about serving yours.
We are gonna build FREE HIV health clinics! We are going to create FREE business education for the poor! We are gonna build HOMELESS and DOMESTIC VIOLENCE SHELTERS! We are gonna REBUILD THE SCHOOL SYSTEM from the ground up! A REVOLUTION IS COMING!!! #philadelphia #orsino2019
The Council Estates Program will provide AFFORDABLE Working/ Middle Class housing at BELOW MARKET RATES and offer retail units to startups owned by individuals from low-income areas. This will contribute to economic diversity and give small business owners access to new markets!

So now #Philadelphia City Gov. is spending thousands to repaint rainbow crosswalks in the #Gayborhood so it looks nice for suburban-trippers, rather then diverting that money to stop the increasing HATE CRIMES or the HIV CRISIS that's KILLING PEOPLE. #priorities #orsino2019

I think an issue everyone in town can get behind is pothole repair and snow removal.  I want to launch a massive pothole repair Initiative in #philadelphia! I also want it written into LAW that EVERY STREET in this city must be snow-free within 24-36 hours of a major snowstorm!
Most of #philadelphia's school buildings were built prior to WWII. I think it's safe to say it may be time for some upgrades.....
By exempting people below the poverty line from both City Wage and Property taxes, we will be taking a major first step towards fighting income inequality in #Philadelphia.

We need better roads in this city! Our infrastructure is terrible! Potholes! Dilapidated bridges! Also what's up with it taking over a WEEK to get some streets plowed after a snowstorm?? That's not gonna fly anymore.... #philadelphia #change #bettergovernment
Our dear leaders in City Hall need to be reminded that they serve the People; the People do not serve them. #riseup #philadelphia #change #wearethe99percent
I propose creating a Labor Council in City Hall comprised of elected union representatives in order to give a voice to organized labor, mediate disputes, and promote our city's industries! #change #workersmovement #philadelphia #strongeconomy
Philadelphia City Council starting salary is about 110 grand. I've been poor the majority of my adult life. Money doesn't mean much to me and no one should get rich being in government. I'm gonna give a good portion back to the community. #change #philadelphia #fairshare
Why do we continue to bleed our poorest residents dry of their income  with unfair tax laws? When elected, people below the poverty line will be exempt from having to pay City Wage AND property taxes. #philadelphia #wearethe99percent #fairshare #change
Every time an election comes up, the same people that have been in power FOREVER, run on the exact same STALE ideas and pretend they're fresh and new. Well I got news for the ESTABLISHMENT: your days in government are numbered. #PHILADELPHIA #change #wearethe99percent
Teachers and first responders make our city function!! Its time we reward them by exempting them from the City Wage Tax and cutting their property taxes in half!!!! #philadelphia #change #wearethe99percent #fairshare
The people of Philadelphia deserve REAL economic and social justice! No one should ever be forced to stay in poverty in America, especially when its forced on them by their own government. #change #philadelphia #wearethe99percent
Philadelphia needs a new type of politician.....#lgbt #philadelphia https://t.co/cnpbkYSM4W

I don't think I'm advocating for anything extreme here; I just want Philadelphia City Gov to tackle this public health crisis! An HIV infection rate 5x's the national average is UNACCEPTABLE!!! #LGBTQ #equality #philly #philadelphia #hiv #wearethe99percent

Philadelphians are entitled to honesty and transparency from their government, not shady backroom deals and disappearing money.....	#honesty #govtransparency #bettergovernment #equality #change #changenow #democracy #philly #philadelphia
Here's a scary statistic: one in five people who are HIV positive don't know it! The City of Philadelphia would benefit from some major investment (both public and private) from some new HIV testing/treatment clinics. #philadelphia #philly #stophiv #hiv #aidsfree	#aids #change

Hey Philadelphia! How about a program that teaches folks in impoverished neighborhoods how to start their own businesses, balance home finances, and increase their property value? It sounds pretty good to me.... #powertothepeople #takebackthecity #rise #fightpoverty #philadelphia
We should exempt k-12 teachers, first responders and those living below the poverty line from the ridiculous and oppressive City Wage Tax!!! #philadelphia #philly #wearethe99percent #helpthepoor #education

The city of Philadelphia has been run  by the same rich elitists since 51'. They say every election prosperity is right around the corner.  Well where is it? Behold the fruits of their labor : poverty, crime, elitism, disease. It's time for CHANGE! #unite #change #philadelphia
The one-percenters running Philly City Gov are content to let LGBTQ folks die of AIDS while they live in luxury. We are not paying taxes to fund your vacation home, Mr. Mayor.	An infection rate 5x's the national average is inexcusable. #HIV #wearethe99percent #LGBTQ 	#Equality

It's pretty messed up that in the so-called "cradle of democracy" people can't even vote for who's on Philly's school board. #democracynow #philly #philadelphia #change
Philadelphia's HIV infection rate is 5 times the national average(+2.9 times higher if you're a person of color) and yet the city gov does NOTHING. #equality ? #HIV
