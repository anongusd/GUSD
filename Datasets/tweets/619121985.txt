@Allegedly_G @sianoresist We are well overdue for a woman to be elected president. That said, we are in desperate need of a progressive person to be elected president. We need more progressive women in the running, yes. Harris, Klobuchar arent it. Warren is better, but still a sellout really.

@JoelRMelamedMD @BernieTheBest1 @nytimes I'm definitely anti-trump, I meant that Hillary is the weaker candidate to pit against him.
@citizengatsby @js_edit @NEO4Bernie and much can happen in the coming months. Indeed, much has happened in the last few days.
@citizengatsby @js_edit @NEO4Bernie technically, most were lost before the race began.
@js_edit @citizengatsby @NEO4Bernie I know how it works. Cheers.
@js_edit @citizengatsby @NEO4Bernie likewise. At least we're all engaged in u.s. politics.
@SophieInCT @citizengatsby @js_edit @NEO4Bernie Nor metric where Clinton wins. Ergo, contested convention.
@js_edit @citizengatsby @NEO4Bernie As the Superdelegate vote can shift, it is going to be contested.
@js_edit @citizengatsby @NEO4Bernie that is a falsehood. Superdelegates make a deciding vote at the convention, and do not count until then.
@js_edit @citizengatsby @NEO4Bernie so you don't understand that neither will have a pledged delegate majority, ergo a contested convention.
@citizengatsby @NEO4Bernie @js_edit A contested convention is a mathematical reality. It is fact. Doesn't matter if you believe it or not.
