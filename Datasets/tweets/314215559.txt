@RepMattGaetz @marthamaccallum @TheStoryFNC Soft unprofessional interview. Matt needs to lose his seat and be disbarred. Intimidating a witness in  the most dirty sleazy way. Out in the open, not even trying to be discreet. His career should be over.
@realDonaldTrump Otto‚Äôs poor parents were used as propaganda for Trump. This is how Trump pays them back, by praising Kim and telling the world he believes Kim‚Äôs word that he had nothing to do with Otto‚Äôs treatment. Trump is a traitor, not worthy of his title. Enough is enough. #25thAmendmentNow
@realDonaldTrump ‚ÄúDuring the course of the Obama Administration, they had no higher priority than securing the release of Americans detained overseas. Under Obama they released at least 10 Americans from North Korean custody during the course of the Obama administration.‚Äù
@realDonaldTrump You couldn‚Äôt tell Kim that to his face could you? He‚Äôs a great guy, you‚Äôre good friends, you love praising him. You‚Äôre a traitor. You‚Äôre spineless when it counts. #Resign

@Grizzly_Stevens @AndrewPollackFL @realDonaldTrump WRONG
@Grizzly_Stevens @AndrewPollackFL @realDonaldTrump You can call them whatever you want. Any gun that has been used in mass shootings, to me, is a killing machine and needs to be off limits for civilian use.
@hopechurchmom @realDonaldTrump @NRA Who is lying?? Not me!
@Grizzly_Stevens @AndrewPollackFL @realDonaldTrump Why are there no mass shootings in any other civilized country???? Wake up!!! No one needs assault weapons!! No one but law enforcement and military. You want a hunting rifle, go for it!! But these weapons that kill 10, 20 and more within seconds??? N0!
@realDonaldTrump Did you talk about how much money the @NRA gives to Trump and the republicans?? How the @NRA wants to sell millions of dollars worth of weapons to schools??????? That is INSANE!!!!
@AndrewPollackFL @realDonaldTrump Did you talk about how much money the @NRA gives to Trump and the republicans?? How the @NRA wants to sell millions of dollars worth of weapons to schools??????? That is INSANE!!!!
@AndrewPollackFL @realDonaldTrump Why do you ignore the gun Mr Pollack?Every other civilized country has mentally ill citizens. What they don‚Äôt have is access to military style assault weapons.Their citizens cannot legally purchase killing machines,how can you not call for an assault weapon ban?Im dumbfounded
@realDonaldTrump Did you mention guns?Did you talk about banning assault weapons?How can a parent sit at that table who lost children not demand gun reform?No other country in the civilized world has this problem.There is mentally ill  in every country,only here can they purchase killing machines
@realDonaldTrump This is what you‚Äôre tweeting during a national emergency??? You‚Äôre making the USA the laughing stock of the world. The only emergency beside gun violence, healthcare, Flint, infrastructure, is YOU. #Resign
