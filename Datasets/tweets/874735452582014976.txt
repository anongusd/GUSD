I never opened a P.O. Box in my life. I found over 120 P.O. Boxes were money has been sent without my knowledge. CASE DISMISSED by Judge White. This was I.D. Theft, Wire Fraud, Forgery, Impersonation, Tax Evasion, Breach of Terrorist Act, and Mail Fraud.	https://t.co/kcPbeeopch https://t.co/NPuByRsYNc
My I.D Theft Complaint to the F.B.I Los Angeles never been investigated to this day. James Comey is responsible, he was the chief back then. Please look at the exhibit attached. #Theft #FBI #breachofterroristact #forgery @BeverlyHillsPD @jaredkushner 	https://t.co/Y9CURpAtIA https://t.co/cJZdp5gQzj

Why did CNN not make a big deal of this case back then? It is never too late. This man is a PATRIOT REPUBLICAN and CRUSADER. He should be named Attorney General of California. He will clean up the place. @realDonaldTrump @jeffsessions @RudyGiuliani @SarahHuckabee @TheRealJohnHCox https://t.co/mLb8amVy0s
This Scandal could have been avoided if Judge White &amp; the Beverly Hills Police would have prosecuted this man 10 years ago. WORST they deprived me of my Constitutional Rights. James Comey was the head of the FBI and allowed this to happen. I.D Theft is a FELONY. @realDonaldTrump https://t.co/wupLetU9Fy
I was a WHISTLEBLOWER against Wells Fargo 10 years ago. The Democratic State of California dismissed my complaint including the Attorney General then Jerry Brown. The Chairman was responsible, he should be in jail for 20 years. He did not serve not even one day. OBAMA ERA. @GOP https://t.co/noKNJr07ZT
Judge White took away all my Constitutional Rights from me and my lawyer Eric George. How can she teach student lawyers when she disregarded the basic principals of our Constitution. I filed a complaint against which is on my Twitter Wall. She should step down. @realDonaldTrump https://t.co/6104f4PMrc

I hope you will change your mind. He cheated his ex-partners lawyers. @ReformOurUS https://t.co/vNcKnMRLbT
This is what the Judicial System does in L.A. Richard Fine was a prosecutor for the government for 25 years. He's been thrown in jail for NO REASON in solitary confinement. No right to have a pen or even a piece of paper. His crime: he was a REPUBLICAN under the Obama Era. @GOP

I discovered someone in Vancouver opened a bank account at RBC with a copy of my Passport and green card. This is ILLEGAL, I've never been to Vancouver in my life. That was in 2009.

@DevinNunes America is such a great country! I am truly a proud citizen! @realDonaldTrump
@MichaelAvenatti And you? Why are you avoiding me? Are you that afraid of me? I will tell the truth about your dishonest ethics. You are a FRAUD! Only in L.A. you can do such a thing!  @realDonaldTrump @Mike_Feuer @MichaelCohen212 @ChrisCuomo @FBIWFO @seanhannity @MayorOfLA @RudyGiuliani
@MichaelAvenatti How about you, AVENATTI? How much did you get for the fraud and impersonation in front of judge in L.A? Pretending you were my lawyer. You are the worst. What goes around come around. Oh! And you are bankrupt now. @MichaelCohen212 @RudyGiuliani @realDonaldTrump @KellyannePolls
@DineshDSouza @BarackObama @realDonaldTrump Obama is nothing compared to the results President Trump attained. The unemployment rate is at it's lowest and the American economy is at it's best. All thanks to President Trump! @realDonaldTrump
@MichaelAvenatti AVENATTI ,you are so vulgar in your comment about michael cohen, you are not including Rudy Giuliani, you are afraid of him? I guess so, I still want my debate with you anytime anywhere . Remember the filing you made on 28 January 2008.  This filing will give you nightmare.
@RyanAFournier Very well said, the economy is at it's best. President Trump has been the best president America has seen in the past 40 years! @realDonaldTrump
@KellyannePolls @POTUS I watched it too, it is very impressive. Trump is as good as Reagan or even better. Best President in 40 years. @realDonaldTrump
@WhiteHouse America can never be better! Perseverance &amp; Courage. Cheers President Trump! @realDonaldTrump

@MichaelAvenatti Your request about Mr. Giuliani is so ridiculous, I will make a survey how many malpractice lawsuits your named as a defendant. How do you feel to be in a bankruptcy? I hope you are going to have to pay the $14 million you owe. @RudyGiuliani @realDonaldTrump @MichaelCohen212
@MichaelAvenatti A question for you, why was it when you impersonated yourself to be my lawyer you did not open a twitter account and be arrogant as you are now? You should be BARED to practice law since 2008. Georges Marciano @RudyGiuliani @MichaelCohen212 @realDonaldTrump
@MichaelAvenatti My guess is you are going to London as an emergency to try to find some dirt on the people you are suing. Bad luck, you are not going to find anything. That's my opinion. You should stay in London a year.	@RudyGiuliani @MichaelCohen212 @realDonaldTrump @finneganLAT @ChrisCuomo

@MichaelAvenatti Michael. How does it feel being put in involuntary bankruptcy? One day, you are on top of the world, the next day you are nothing. What goes around comes around. I hold you responsible for all of what happened to me. Look on TMZ Lawsuit you filed without being my lawyer ever.
@MichaelAvenatti IS A QUOTE: LIKE YOU ARE YOU THINK THE PEOPLE ARE. YOU FOOL. You must be addicted to porn, all kinds of porn. That fit you perfectly
@MichaelAvenatti You must be a porn addict, and try to find if is any movie porn you missed.
