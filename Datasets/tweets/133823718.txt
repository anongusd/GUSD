@ethanrs98 If our students agree to a phased construction, we can def do so. We all agree that the quad needs to be renovated. We will engage in dialogue with our students so the solution is student-centric. If construction ever occurs 24 hours, please report it to us.
@KingRasta__ @bonjourszn @150Bison I think we may get a mixed bag of sentiments from students with regards to coping with construction noise but at the end of the day, that‚Äôs what the dialogue is for. We can talk it through, then jointly decide on a path forward.

@smugglets_ sounds good to me! Come through. Bring your data. Don't  speak off rumors. People make things up all the time.
@_KickSand Our dorms are next. That request came directly from our student body. I didn't ignore it. I listen and I make the changes.
@_KickSand I am paying close attention to everything we need to fix on campus. I like nice things. I want our students to have nice things.
@_KickSand One doesn't compete with the other. Some fixes yield a quicker return on investment and are done according to strat plan.
@_KickSand Definitely not. That would be discriminatory. We can't do that at all. Would never do that.
@_KickSand Our AD is doing so simultaneously. The soccer club is not a CIAA team. Doesn't come with the same expenditures. Major difference.
@smugglets_  2 students were in my office at 8:30AM before I flew out. Have you requested an appt? I'm not aware of a waiting list.
@__teamDY @smugglets_ The gym floor has a lifetime that has expired. Athletes get injured if the padding isn't adequate. We're fixing it.
@smugglets_ I was on a plane. Just seeing your tweets. As I said, come to see me. Bring all the questions you have and I will answer.
@smugglets_ Its a soccer club, not a CIAA team. If you need deets, my door is always open.
@smugglets_ @ShawBears Our Athletics Dept. is being restructured. The Athletic Director is communicating with everyone. We came to #win.
@_KickSand what's the question?
