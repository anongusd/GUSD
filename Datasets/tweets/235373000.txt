Federal employees – including law enforcement, TSA screeners, Forest Service firefighters, food safety inspectors, and others – are forced to go without pay during the holidays as a result of the #TrumpShutdown. Retweet to call on @HouseGOP &amp; @RealDonaldTrump to reopen the govt.
Who is forced to work without pay during the #TrumpShutdown? Americans working at @StateDept, @USDA, @Interior, @USTreasury, @TheJusticeDept, @CommerceGov, @DHSgov, @USDOT, @HUDgov, @EPA, @NASA, @PeaceCorps, @SBAGov and other agencies. RT if you agree that's unacceptable.
Our federal workers do not deserve furloughs, pay delays and uncertainty at the end of the year. They work too hard serving our country to be put in this position. Trump and his supporters must end the #TrumpShutdown immediately. https://t.co/9L3qV1qRMv

The only adult in the room stepping down would have been more negative if Trump didn’t engage in his art of deflection. This is no way to say thank you to our dedicated federal workforce. Americans deserve much better from the office of the President.
We reached an agreement on the final package of spending bills only to have Trump shut it down after Freedom Caucus members pushed him. A lot of this is part of Trump’s efforts to change the narrative after Secretary Mattis’ stunning resignation.
What is most upsetting is that Congress did its job. For the first time in about a decade, through the regular order, we finished significant portions of the appropriations process in bipartisan fashion.
Our farmers, already reeling from historic wet weather in the islands, won't have access to county service offices or federal aid. Small business loans won't be issued. Thankfully, our DOD workforce in the islands was previously funded through the current fiscal year.
In Hawaii, where we are dependent on our visitor industry to drive our economy, our National Parks will be forced to shutter operations during one of their busiest seasons.
The 'law and order' President just assured that 41,000 federal law enforcement and correctional officers, including 13,709 FBI agents, 4,399 DEA agents, and 16,742 Bureau of Prisons correctional officers will lose money before Christmas.
Ironically, by shutting down the government, he is ensuring that nearly 107,000 Customs and Border Protection agents and Transportation Security Administration workers will be forced to defend our borders with the added stress of an immediate loss in pay.
He chooses the Christmas season to pander to his base and shutdown the government because Congress refuses to pay nearly $6 billion for a wall along the southern border that is nothing more than a political talking point for his next campaign.
It is unfortunate that in the midst of the Holiday season President Trump is forcing more than 420,000 federal workers to continue on the job without pay. Hopefully, after quick reflection, the President and his enablers re-think this approach to funding the government.
.@realDonaldTrump has (once again) brought us close to failing to fund the government. Americans need us to act responsibly. Congress reached a bipartisan compromise before Trump decided to pander to his base. Do your job @POTUS Keep the government running. #TrumpShutdown
I have always respected General Mattis for his four decades of service to our country and his commitment to reigning in the ridiculous defense policies pushed by @realDonaldTrump and his @GOP. He was one of the few adults allowed in Trump’s room. We wish him the best. https://t.co/Hx9cLhK6Vw

Judge Kavanaugh supports the Trump administration’s work to undermine the Affordable Care Act, especially for Americans managing pre-existing conditions.
In addition to the serious, credible criminal allegations against Judge Kavanaugh, Trump’s Republican Party confirmed a pro-business conservative, who opposes stricter gun laws and environmental regulations.
It matters who controls the Senate and the House.  And it highlights the dire need to elect more Democratic women. His behavior before the Senate Judiciary committee displayed a partisanship and a lack of judicial temperament that should have been disqualifying, in and of itself.

Trump, boxed in by federal probes, whose longtime attorney alleged is a unindicted co-conspirator of a federal crime, wants to appoint a Justice who believes a sitting President is above the law. Trump promised to repeal #RoevWade &amp; Kavanaugh backs his play. #StopKavanaugh
Too few of Judge Kavanaugh's records are public. Once again, Trump and his GOP do not believe in transparency and the public's right to know. What's the rush? What are they hiding? This Judge is seeking a lifetime appointment. Americans deserve better. #StopKavanaugh

America needs more solutions, not pollution when it comes to climate change. Trump’s rollback of existing federal clean air standards will cost the U.S. $450 billion by 2050 and expose Americans to increased health risks caused by air pollution. Americans deserve #HigherStandards

Trump has declined to defend the Affordable Care Act in court, and the case will likely end up in the Supreme Court. Judge Kavanaugh supports Trump's methods to undermine the ACA. Health care for millions of Americans could depend on his confirmation. #WhatsAtStake

Judge Kavanaugh supports the Trump administration’s efforts and methods to undermine the Affordable Care Act, especially when it comes to Americans dealing with pre-existing conditions.”
He is a pro-business conservative to the right of Justice Kennedy, who opposes tougher gun laws and environmental regulations.
Kavanaugh wrote ‘government has permissible interests in favoring fetal life, protecting the best interests of a minor, and refraining from facilitating abortion.’
In October, Kavanaugh dissented when the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit stopped the Trump administration from blocking a 17-year-old migrant from obtaining an abortion.
Moreover, Judge Kavanaugh has consistently opposed the fundamental rights of women. Trump is on a crusade to overturn Roe v. Wade, a pursuit that will likely result in a lawsuit that could come before the Supreme Court.
Judge Kavanaugh believes, as Trump does, that the President should have broad executive authority. He consistently sided with arguments that supported that position during his 12 years as a Judge for the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit.
I urge my colleagues in the Senate to reject the President’s attempt to fundamentally alter the balance of the court and further chip away at the protections guaranteed by our Constitution.
It is no coincidence that a President under federal investigation and the defendant in multiple civil lawsuits is nominating a Judge who has pushed Congress to pass legislation exempting the President from civil actions and criminal investigations while in office. #WhatsAtStake

We must not allow this administration to continue to put the special interests of their friends and businesses before environmental protection and preservation.
When considering the nomination of the next EPA administrator, I urge my colleagues to remember the EPA’s mission; ‘to protect human health and the environment… and ensure Americans have clean air, land and water.’
The acting EPA administrator, Andrew Wheeler, is an experienced D.C. operator who shares Trump and Pruitt’s affinity for eliminating environmental regulations and protections. He may be more skilled at working around and through the laws and process than Mr. Pruitt.
His scandal laden tenure and questionable conduct aside, do not forget the Trump administration’s work to do away with federal regulations that protect our environment.
Finally, amidst 13 separate federal investigations into his security spending, first class travel habits other alleged violations, @ScottPruittOK resigned.
Thankfully, @EPA @ScottPruittOK decided to step down amid 13 federal investigations into his conduct in office. But please don't forget the administration has five days to reunite nearly 3,000 children with their families: https://t.co/gfCXXb8H67 #FamiliesBelongTogether

Remember, we are technically not at peace with Korea, there is an armistice in place. The details of this agreement are critical to defining the way forward and only time will tell. #NorthKorea
I was concerned the President was going to go there and sign a peace treaty and make a show of it. That would have put us in a precarious position because it would have paved the legal pathway for the removal of U.S. troops from South Korea.
United States. All the experts in attendance, including the delegation from China, were unanimous in their belief that peace and diplomatic relations could not be restored if the leaders of United States and North Korea could not meet and speak.
including former U.S. Ambassador to South Korea Christopher Hill and Sue Mi Terry, a former North Korea analyst for the CIA. Ambassador Hill attended the six-party talks that occurred intermittenly starting in 2003 between China, Japan, North Korea, Russia, South Korea, and the
In March, I had the privilege of  attending the Aspen Institute’s Congressional Program titled “Finding a Diplomatic Solution to the North Korea Crisis” at Stanford University. The conference featured three days of round table discussions with scholars, soldiers, and diplomats,
It is also concerning that there was almost no mention of North Korea’s atrocious human rights records and whether it would be a condition required in any agreement.
It will take significant negotiations and diplomatic maneuvering to define the details of this vague agreement. How will we enforce it?
My hope is that this meeting is not the end, rather the beginning of a means to the end. We must remember the two individuals leading these negotiations. They both have a history of backing out of big deals and making false promises.
The two leaders agreed “to build a lasting and stable peace regime on the Korean peninsula” and “the DPRK commits to work toward complete denuclearization of the Korean peninsula.” They put that in writing.
For Hawaii, this should assuage fears of a possible nuclear attack from North Korea. My belief has always been that our greatest nuclear adversary remains Russia. There is no doubt that this is a historic moment in the relationship between the countries and the region #NorthKorea

However, it is a clear warning to government that they should not insert their individual beliefs into a fair and impartial decision-making process.
This is a situation where the Supreme Court of the United States ruled against a government commission’s failure to afford due process. They did not, in anyway, reverse the progress we have made to protect and advance the innate rights of our #LGBTQ community.
The Supreme Court’s ruling is an unfortunate start to LGBTQ #PrideMonth and a reminder that we have a lot of work ahead of us. Every person is free to be exactly who they are and to love who they love.
Seeking asylum in is not illegal, in fact, it is written into US laws to ensure that those with a credible fear of persecution can present their case. Moms, dads &amp; children must have a fair process &amp; the ability to seek asylum without being separated. https://t.co/CPOKdC7zIm

We must never forget the injustice of Japanese internment. We can never again allow our country to imprison its people because of their ancestry, not because they committed a crime. We cannot allow racial stereotyping to be a part of policy making, ever again.
.@SecretaryZinke continues to miss the point. This is racial stereotyping. Does he greet others in their ancestral language?

America’s teachers are underpaid, our schools are underfunded and that means our children are often denied access to the quality public education they need to succeed. They deserve #ABetterDeal  https://t.co/4OsLiSWLwF
The rule is the latest attempt by Trump's GOP to turn back the clock &amp; take away women's basic health, rights, &amp; freedoms. Ironic that they Target Title X, a bipartisan program signed into law by then President Richard Nixon. I urge my colleagues to act to ensure #NoGagRule
Title X serves more than 4 million patients a year. Under the Trump/Pence rule, patients will be denied complete &amp; accurate information about their reproductive healthcare options. It also prohibits providers from referring patients for safe, legal abortion services. #NoGagRule
Title X is the only federal program exclusively dedicated to family planning and reproductive-health services. @realDonaldTrump's @GOP issued a rule designed to undermine a program that primarily helps the uninsured, low-income Americans and young people. #NoGagRule

Happy to be home in Honolulu for the weekend. Quick trip, but thankful for the chance to pay respects and help honor @SenatorAkaka His legacy of kindness and legislating with Aloha remains the standard we should all aspire to.
Congress must enact reasonable gun control legislation that improves public safety &amp; respects the rights of law abiding gun owners. We should ban assault weapons &amp; expand background checks on all gun sales. I remain committed to a bipartisan solution to help #EndGunViolence
Our rate of gun deaths is higher than most other countries in the world. We are capable of so much as a nation. But we consistently fail to protect our children and communities from gun violence.
We are heartbroken by the tragedy in #SantaFe Our Aloha and prayers are with everyone impacted by this horrific act. Barely three months after #Parkland &amp; America again mourns the tragic loss of children, killed by gun violence while attending school.

I don’t believe the President had the authority to order this strike and escalate a long standing conflict without a clear plan or endgame. Under the War Powers Act, he should have come to Congress to seek authorization.
The use of chemical weapons is a heinous violation of international law and should be dealt with by the international community. However, Syria is not within the purview of the current Authorization for Use of Military Force (AUMF).

Remember so it is never repeated.  I call upon you to join in the fight to ensure this country never forgets that it imprisoned its people because of their ancestry, not because they committed a crime.
How ironic that the most decorated unit in military history, the 100th battalion, 442 Regimental Combat Team, fought for a country that considered them enemy aliens. We must never forget our voices or the fact that we must fight so all can remember the injustice.
When @SecretaryZinke chose to address me in Japanese (when no one else was greeted in their ancestral language), I understood ‘this is precisely why Japanese Americans were treated as they were more than 75 years ago. It is racial stereotyping.
These programs tell the horrific stories of 120,000 Japanese American men, women and children, including my grandfathers, who were arrested and imprisoned during World War II.
Last year 23 organizations in seven states received JACS funding totaling $2,869,500 to create curriculum, build infrastructure and finance programs, some at former internment sites like Honouliuli and Sante Fe, New Mexico.
The real issue here is that the administration ignored one of the most racially motivated periods in American history by defunding the Japanese American Confinement Sites (JACS) grant program. https://t.co/Z2YeqMF3L6

As we move forward with the appropriations process, let us be ever mindful of the horrible policies and elitist vision outlined by the #TrumpBudget The #BudgetDeal proved that Congress can embrace bipartisanship to provide for our communities.

I remain committed to this cause and my support for the military, our federal civilian employees and domestic programs does not diminish my resolve to protect #Dreamers and restore #DACA
While I am sincerely disappointed we were unable to reach a comprehensive agreement to protect the #Dreamers and restore the #DACA , I am optimistic the Senate and House will move forward with immigration bills that will protect an estimated 800,000 #DREAMERS from and fix #DACA .
In addition to a two-year defense budget, the legislation that passed tonight funds non-defense programs that support our communities, veterans, education, healthcare, children and infrastructure at a level $177 billion higher than the Trump administration requested for FY18.
In addition, Hawaii is home to over 33,000 federal civilian employees, of which approximately 16,500 work in the armed services.  These men and women deserve more than stop-gap funding which hampers their ability to complete their mission and protect our nation.
With @PacificCommand and all four component services, as well as the @USCG , located in the State of Hawaii and integral to preserving security, stability and freedom in the Asia-Pacific region, Congress must provide our military the predictable financial resources it needs.
“The two-year budget deal is an imperfect but necessary compromise given the current political climate in Washington, D.C. "
Good morning, we are up early and on the House floor debating a two-year agreement to fund the government.

This incident also highlighted the need to review HI-EMA’s Attack Warning Signal system and our community response plan in the event of a biological, chemical, radiological or nuclear attack.
The public deserves a transparent, accurate accounting, like the one recently completed by the FCC, so we can make corrections and move forward.
In the weeks since the false alarm, we have heard confusing, often conflicting accounts from state officials about what went wrong and who is responsible.
The morning of January 13th revealed an unfortunate array of issues within the Hawaii Emergency Management Agency (HI-EMA), the protocols and policies that govern the issuance of a ballistic missile alert and the community’s preparation and response.
“This legislation is an important part of rebuilding the public’s trust in government. One of our basic responsibilities is to provide public safety, especially in a moment of crisis." https://t.co/35zGSqWZKP
We remain hopeful that the Senate will send back a bipartisan spending bill that addresses the caps and allows us to continue the appropriations process. Any deal cut on spending should include a way forward to protect our #Dreamers
It is fundamentally unfair to increase defense spending without addressing how to increase funding for education, healthcare, transportation and other non-defense programs. I will not support a bill that does not address the spending caps instituted by the Budget Control Act. https://t.co/6Twe53SedP

For a @POTUS who is calling for a bipartisan path to citizenship for immigrants, he certainly extended no olive branches to @TheDemocrats tonight #SOTU
He can clap for himself all he wants but this speech was heavy on old Trump talking points but offered little in the way of innovative thinking about the real issues facing our nation. Americans deserve better. #SOTU
People do not realize that, because like everything else with this administration, the message and the reality are rarely the same. Trump is always willing to employ divisive, discriminatory rhetoric and fake facts to justify his message.
For example, we are allegedly set to launch a massive infrastructure improvement campaign? He wants states to invest at an 80/20 split with the federal government.
Congress still does not understand how we are paying for the tax cuts the Republicans passed last fall that are projected to increase deficits by an estimated $1.46 trillion over the next decade.
True to Trump, he claimed credit for everything good that is happening in America but listen carefully to what it is that he is selling. We do not have the money to pay for the things he proposed.

@markeno Mahalo, Mark, for reaching out. I voted NO. This bill is not sound, thoughtful tax policy, it was crafted to fulfill a campaign promise made by @realDonaldTrump and to give the @GOP a talking point for the upcoming elections. #GOPTaxScam
The American people strongly oppose the #GOPTaxScam Republicans are voting on now. Why? Because it raises taxes on 86 million middle-class families in order to give massive tax cuts to the wealthy. And Congress has not had the time to thoroughly vet the measure. I'm voting NO. https://t.co/o8FeOawH1L
