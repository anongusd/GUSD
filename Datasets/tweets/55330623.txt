@NellcottMovie The Children's Lit Guy.
@CfandJf You guys are cute!
I need English subtitles on while watching any movie at home or I feel like I'm missing a quarter of the dialogue.
@jillcarter Hope we can find someone as good as the young Adrien Brody.
@jillcarter watched the movie "Love the Hard Way" because it sounded a bit like Nellcott, except with prostitution and suicide.
I just referenced the end of my script at the beginning whoa
