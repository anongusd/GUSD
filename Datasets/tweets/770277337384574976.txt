#GunControlNow, #BoycottNRA, and #ResignSheriffIsrael are all correct in my opinion.
@Mediaite It is super important for us in favor of gun control to realize that #BoycottNRA and #ResignSheriffIsrael are NOT in any kind of conflict. You can believe the shooter should not have had his gun AND believe the sheriff did not fulfill his duties.
@NBCNews Most officers would have gone into the building. He just seems like a bad apple in that respect. I do not believe from this incident we can draw conclusions about other School Resource Officers and their commitment to keeping students safe.
@RawStory I strongly disagree with the NRA, so I am all for #BoycottNRA. But the Sheriff sadly failed in many respects, so I am also for #ResignSheriffIsrael. I can want gun control and also hold people responsible when they fail.
For those of us on the left, there really should not be a conflict in supporting both #BoycottNRA and #ResignSheriffIsrael
@johnpavlovitz I believe you can be in favor of both #BoycottNRA as well as #ResignSheriffIsrael. I disagree with the NRA on countless issues. I also believe the Sheriff failed many times throughout this ordeal.

@MSNBC Lawrence I like you but you’re talking about literally milliseconds of difference in arrival time, this is not a good talking point. Having a rifle does not magically make you bulletproof..
@PolitiFact I just don’t see why the student would lie. Unless more solid evidence can be produced, I’m going to believe him.
@CNN The shooting wouldn’t have happened if the evil gunman did not have a firearm. But the shooting wouldn’t have resulted in as many deaths if this officer would have done his job and saved those innocent children. Shame on him.
@CNNPolitics I agree it’s ironic because he dodged the draft, but we shouldn’t let that excuse the officer for doing nothing
@Tim_Canova I can understand how militarizing schools could put kids in flight or flight mode, but you also have to understand how being afraid a gunman is going to come in and kill them puts kids in fight or flight mode. Kids shouldn’t have to ask their parents for bulletproof backpacks :(
@ABC Well on the last part of the statement, and AR-15 doesn’t make a person bulletproof, but I agree with the general sentiment. If you want armed security in schools at least do it with police officers actually trained to handle active shooter incidents.
