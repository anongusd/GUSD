@Caloparker @MarcRudov @brithume If that's supposed to be good analysis, you're doing a terrible job. Fox News is the most dishonest mainstream media outlet, and that is an incontrovertible fact.

@nfltexanchick @GeorgeSchirra @NyleDiMarco Very often, the smartest thing to do is walk away from a bad situation. If they were truly waiting for their bus, they could have moved off the memorial steps closer to the bus pickup. Given your expertise, I'm sure you know that the nearest street is about 300 feet away.
@nfltexanchick @GeorgeSchirra @NyleDiMarco When I was a high schooler from a private Christian school in a small city visiting the big city, I knew better than to engage with the crazies. These kids should have too. Not knowing BHI specifically is not an excuse for their lack of common sense or decency.
@GeorgeSchirra @NyleDiMarco Not at all. But what's the merit of making a headline out of something everyone knows? The BHI does this to get attention. Given that enough people know about them and the attention is what they want, why engage?
@nfltexanchick @GeorgeSchirra @NyleDiMarco Were you at the Memorial on the same day as a major march? If not, I'm not surprised you didn't encounter them. They aren't always in the same spot.

@GeorgeSchirra @NyleDiMarco "BHI Yells Offensive Things at Tourists" is not news. It's the status quo.

@r1chardeldridge @JamesRoday @SavannahGuthrie @TODAYshow With respect, I think he destroyed his own reputation through his irresponsible and offensive actions.

@r1chardeldridge @JamesRoday @SavannahGuthrie @TODAYshow With respect, as a resident of DC, nobody waits for their bus on the steps of the memorial. The street is 300 feet away. Had they really been waiting for a bus, they could have moved closer to where pick up actually happens. Further, the kids were in a shouting match with BHI.
@r1chardeldridge @JamesRoday @SavannahGuthrie @TODAYshow Very often, the right response is to not engage. Regardless of the BHI or Phillips, who was trying to defuse the situation, the CovCath kids or their chaperones could have chosen to turn the other cheek and walk away.

@Jeronimous2 @wtroyc @Whitney85708107 @SenJeffMerkley Nah, dude. The most important take away is that "nuance" is an excuse for spineless moderates to ignore racism when there's more than one bad actor in a situation. You're as bad as those kids and the "Trumpanzees" you denounced earlier.
@wtroyc @Jeronimous2 @Whitney85708107 @SenJeffMerkley They chose to publicly self identify as supporters of a racist ideology. If they didn't want people to think they were racists, they shouldn't have worn hats that are symbols of racism and they shouldn't have harassed an old man.
@wtroyc @Jeronimous2 @Whitney85708107 @SenJeffMerkley Well, in that case, you're just wrong. Those kids behaved horribly. Every white person in DC has been harassed by the BHI before. These kids and their chaperones lacked the integrity to just ignore them.
@loveispower1111 @UoMTigers @robbysoave @MaxKennerly No, the main teen is several rows back in his red hat, just to the left of the play icon in this picture. https://t.co/7A2CKBqxUD

@wtroyc @Jeronimous2 @Whitney85708107 @SenJeffMerkley He was getting in between two antagonistic groups. Jesus, have you literally never of breaking up a fight?
@UoMTigers @loveispower1111 @robbysoave @MaxKennerly In this video from shortly after Phillips approached the teenagers, you can see that Sandmann is not at the front of the crowd. He moved to the front specifically to get in Phillips' face. https://t.co/AHghKly2Ad
@UoMTigers @loveispower1111 @robbysoave @MaxKennerly When he approached them to intervene with his peace chant, the main kid, Sandmann, wasn't at the front of the group. Sandmann moved to the front specifically to get in Phillips' face. Also, the person who told them to go back to Europe wasn't Phillips. Get your facts straight.
@UoMTigers @loveispower1111 @robbysoave @MaxKennerly It was clearly a hypothetical, dude. My point is that two wrongs don't make a right. Harassing Phillips because the BHI were being shitty is still a bad thing to do.
@UoMTigers @loveispower1111 @robbysoave @MaxKennerly Fwiw, I work in DC, so I'm very familiar with the Lincoln Memorial. They had a right to be there, but it's not possible that waiting for the bus means they couldn't leave the steps of the memorial.
@UoMTigers @loveispower1111 @robbysoave @MaxKennerly Yeah, dude. BHI being wrong doesn't make the kids' behavior OK. The responsible thing to do would have been to ignore them. In high school, I got bullied by a black student who called me homophobic slurs. Would it have been OK if I called him the n-word in retaliation?
@UoMTigers @loveispower1111 @robbysoave @MaxKennerly Nobody waits for a bus on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial. The nearest street is like 300 feet away. I'm not saying they didn't have a right to be there, but it doesn't make sense to wait for a bus where it can't pick you up.
@beachkittenenc @matt_logue @_DrMomLady @LWavghist @patbirdies @jaketapper How is it possible that you've never heard of high school bullies before? But for what it's worth, that kid came out of the crowd and approached Phillips. This footage shows that Sandmann wasn't at the front of the group when Phillips first approaches. https://t.co/AHghKly2Ad
@beachkittenenc @matt_logue @_DrMomLady @LWavghist @patbirdies @jaketapper Sandmann wasn't staring down BHI, he was staring down an old man performing a peace chant to try and defuse a tense situation. That smile is epitome of the bully smile.
@patbirdies @_DrMomLady @LWavghist @matt_logue @jaketapper To be clear, one argument is unequal because there's footage of a kid wearing the modern equivalent of a white hood getting in the face of a elderly man. Phillips had been there for a little while and was clearly not harming anyone when Sandmann decided to have his stare down.
@Jeronimous2 @Whitney85708107 @SenJeffMerkley I sorta think that calling them "goofy white kids in the wrong hat" ignores the problem. There wasn't really anything goofy about how they treated Phillips, and that hat represents a specific, hateful political affiliation.
@Whitney85708107 @Jeronimous2 @SenJeffMerkley He walked up to try and defusion a confrontation between the kids and BHI. They were mocking him on the basis of his race with tomahawk chops and mocking chants. That's basically the dictionary definition of racism.
@hiwaysixtyone @randywerline @Karaszewski Neat.
@Jeronimous2 @Whitney85708107 @SenJeffMerkley The interview I mentioned:  https://t.co/wC8Zq5I40o
@Jeronimous2 @Whitney85708107 @SenJeffMerkley All I can provide is the footage that I'm sure you also watched. Phillips said upfront in an interview that there were two groups, he didn't understand what they were fighting over, so he stepped in between them. I didn't see it as particularly aggressive.
@Whitney85708107 @Jeronimous2 @SenJeffMerkley "A lot of people do a racist thing" doesn't make the thing not racist. Your ignorance of racism is not a defense of their acts. Even if BHI was worse, those kids were still racist. They don't cancel each other out. Dox the BHI folks. It's fair. They probably just don't care.
@hiwaysixtyone @randywerline @Karaszewski I think you're in the minority with that interpretation.
@hiwaysixtyone @randywerline @Karaszewski What the fuck are you even talking about
@Jeronimous2 @SenJeffMerkley The tomahawk chops and mocking chants, regardless of BHI provocation, are still racist. BHI's involvement doesn't change the racism of the CovCath students' behavior toward Phillips. 2/2
@Jeronimous2 @SenJeffMerkley I think the footage is pretty clear that the students responded to Phillips' attempt to de-escalate by surrounding him and getting in his face. BHI are shit heads. I work in DC, and am very familiar with their demonstrations. 1/2
@Klaus_Flauten @JannnetShannnon @jaketapper They surrounded Phillips and did racist stuff like tomahawk chops. There isn't a way to contextualize it so that the behavior isn't racist. It's possible for these kids and the BHI group to both be bad people.
@_DrMomLady @LWavghist @patbirdies @matt_logue @jaketapper Impartiality doesn't mean treating two unequal arguments as equal.
@Libprivilegeusa @SenJeffMerkley He stepped between them and BHI to perform a peace chant, and they responded by surrounding him and doing racist shit.
@Claudia79978298 @yerrcity @Midnightingale8 @SenJeffMerkley Surrounding Phillips and doing tomahawk chops is still racist, my guy.
@Jeronimous2 @SenJeffMerkley They did actually surround this guy and do racist stuff though. Like, that's obviously what happened. BHI doesn't change that.
@hiwaysixtyone @randywerline @Karaszewski Not really. He was mean and crazy from the start. Sure, he hadn't murdered anyone, but there was never a point in the movie where the viewer thinks "He's a good guy."
@iRobier @chrismcquarrie The fact that BHI was also being aggressor doesn't mean that surrounding Nathan Phillips and mocking his chants and doing tomahawk chops somehow isn't racist. It is possible for BHI and the CovCath kids to both be bad people.
@hiwaysixtyone @randywerline @Karaszewski I'm not sure what you mean. In the novel, Jack is a good man who is driven insane slowly by the Overlook. In the movie, Jack is an insane person before ever taking the job.
@LetMESay3 @chuffaholic @SineQuaN0nUSA @BrettSaundry @sci_teacher117 @jaketapper @reason @robbysoave They were clearly mocking him. The BHI shit aside, they were still mocking Nathan Phillips while he was trying to de-escalate a bad situation. It's wild how much you're all bending over backwards to be like "That obviously racist stuff actually isn't racist."
@hiwaysixtyone @randywerline @Karaszewski Jack being a good but flawed man is the emotional core of the novel. Making changes in a movie adaptation is fine, but Kubrick lost the heart of the story and much of its terror by making Jack always crazy. It might have been his intention, but I think it was a bad decision.
@KaiaSerene @TobyDray @nuDocES @jordanjones3 @julesgc57 @KellyJoBluen And I think you're a danger to democracy who enables racists, so I guess we're even.
@TobyDray @askanonpro @chiragshekhar @jordanjones3 @nuDocES It can't though. Saying it went "too far" is a pretty clear indicator of a person's views on gender relations in America, and no person is entitled to an audience. Politics is world view. Personally, I would never date a conservative because their beliefs are abhorrent to me.
@TobyDray @nuDocES @KaiaSerene @jordanjones3 @julesgc57 @KellyJoBluen That's not really true. Debates publicize views. Refusing to give bad opinions a platform restricts their spread. Debates don't change anyone's views, it's just an attempt by the oppressor to seem reasonable and get publicity.

@Rgerman49 @FairfaxJustin Less racist, for sure.
@Rgerman49 @FairfaxJustin Your heritage is an embarrassment, and Confederates were traitors. It's too bad your ancestors survived the war. America would be better without you.
@TypeError_ @Gwatson0008 @FairfaxJustin He doesn't. He's an embarrassment to this state because he killed US citizens to protect his ability to own, rape, and murder black people.
@Rgerman49 @FairfaxJustin Sounds like you're defending slavery. But no, slavery wasn't the straw that broke the camel's back. It was the whole camel, you stupid old racist. You clearly don't know anything about the subject, so you should probably keep your mouth shut.
RT @maxschachter: In 2019 we will push for safe storage laws. Reducing the number of suicides will save lives and prevent school shootings.‚Ä¶
@TypeError_ @Gwatson0008 @FairfaxJustin That's a lot of speculation there, fella. Let's stick to what actually happened. How come you haven't said that you think slavery is wrong yet? Do you think slavery is good?
@TypeError_ @Gwatson0008 @FairfaxJustin Well, it would have been really easy for you to say "Of course there shouldn't be monuments for Hitler," which is what I was genuinely hoping you would say, so that I could say "Slavery is also a genocide, and we shouldn't build monuments to its perpetrators." And yet you didn't.
@TypeError_ @Gwatson0008 @FairfaxJustin I don't think we should have any monuments to any slaveholders, but notably Washington belatedly freed his slaves while Lee literally led a war to keep his. Lee is also a traitor to the United States. Seems like you have some sympathy for Hitler like you do for Lee.
@Rgerman49 @FairfaxJustin That was the main reason. Read a book, dude. Seven states seceded before Lincoln's inauguration, and six issued secession statements. All six named slavery as the primary reason, as did A. Stephens' cornerstone speech. And uh, which states' rights specifically? Slavery, perhaps?
@TypeError_ @Gwatson0008 @FairfaxJustin Well, it was more evil in that it started a war to protect slavery, but yes, any governmemt support for slavery is evil.
@TypeError_ @Gwatson0008 @FairfaxJustin Sure they do. My point is that we shouldn't build monuments to honor evil. The Nazi and Confederate governments are both evil. If Nazi monuments are wrong, Confederate monuments are wrong. It's weird that you keep dodging the answer about monuments to Hitler.
@TypeError_ @Gwatson0008 @FairfaxJustin Didn't say it was the only one, but it is unquestionably the primary one. And it's not "rightly or wrongly." It's "wrongly." Stop defending the Confederacy. It was an evil regime.
@TypeError_ @Gwatson0008 @FairfaxJustin I assume you're referencing Vietnam, and it seems that you think the Vietnam memorial should exist. You're also comparing Vietnam veterans to the Wehrmacht by asking this question. Should I conclude then that you think Hitler should be honored with memorials?
@TypeError_ @Gwatson0008 @FairfaxJustin I don't honor the people who defending slavery. They were traitors who supported and evil cause. Should Germany build monuments to Hitler and the Wehrmacht?
@TypeError_ @Gwatson0008 @FairfaxJustin I accept it as a fact and am embarrassed by it. It's important to learn from our mistakes. This is especially true for Virginia.
@TypeError_ @Gwatson0008 @FairfaxJustin The North didn't set the terms. By seceding and specifically claiming slavery as the reason then starting the war by firing on Ft. Sumter, the South started a war to defend slavery, regardless of the North's initial objective. There's pretty broad consensus on this by historians.
@TypeError_ @Gwatson0008 @FairfaxJustin And none of that justifies Lee's treason and the evil of slavery.
@TypeError_ @Gwatson0008 @FairfaxJustin I know that. And none of that morally justifies taking up arms in defense of slavery.
@TypeError_ @Gwatson0008 @FairfaxJustin Well, I'm proud of the Americans who stopped slavery. You seem to be proud of the Americans who defended it. Hard not to wonder why.
@TypeError_ @Gwatson0008 @FairfaxJustin I am not, though it seems like you're proud of colonial slavery because you think this is some sort of "gotcha" moment.
@TypeError_ @FairfaxJustin Then it sounds like the war was worth it to me. And why did the South secede? Of the seven states who seceded before Lincoln's inauguration, six issued statements of secession. Each specifically names slavery as the reason. Alexander Stephens' Cornerstone speech does too.
@TypeError_ @Gwatson0008 @FairfaxJustin You're proud of slavery, then?
@TypeError_ @FairfaxJustin You're only saying that because you know you can't get away with saying that you think slavery is good. Like all Confederate losers, you're lying about "Northern aggression" and "states' rights" to avoid the truth of the war.
@TypeError_ @FairfaxJustin As I recall, Virginia failed to acquire independence when Grant kicked Lee's dishonorable ass. It's clear that you don't actually care about the Constitution. You're just a racist who wants to defend slavery. You're an embarrassment to Virginia.
@TypeError_ @FairfaxJustin Lee owned people and fought a war against the American government to protect slavery. No man who fought for slavery has honor. You're probably one of those dumb ass conservatives who only cares about the Constitution when you can use to justify bigotry. Read Art. 3 Sec. 3.
@TypeError_ @FairfaxJustin No good Virginians honor Lee. Lee was human garbage and deserved worse than he got. He committed literally the Constitutional definition of treason. Neo Confederates like you are an embarrassment to this state. It sounds like you support slavery.
@Rgerman49 @FairfaxJustin Lee and Jackson were traitors to our country, and they fought a war to keep black Americans in chains.
@neillisaward @JohnMTweet @FairfaxJustin They weren't great men. They were traitors and slavers. Should Germany honor Hitler and Goebbels?
@TypeError_ @FairfaxJustin Lee was a traitor who thought it was OK to own people and fought to preserve slavery. No patriots honor Lee.

@joesphVoid @havlochtakacs @SirLarr Most undocumented immigrants enter the country legally, first of all, and also, being undocumented is not an excuse to treat them as subhuman. But I really love your defense racism. I wonder what it must be like to not know the difference between legality and morality.
@Dat_Boi_Dalton @SirLarr I could find you evidence that border patrol agents are more conservative and that conservatives are more racist, but I'm on my phone and don't feel like dealing with your bad faith argument anymore.
@Dat_Boi_Dalton @SirLarr Find me statistics that they aren't.
@Dat_Boi_Dalton @SirLarr Didn't say it makes anyone racist. I said it's a job that attracts existing racists.
@Dat_Boi_Dalton @SirLarr Not a logical fallacy, and for what it's worth, pointing out logical fallacies is also a logical fallacy (yes I see the irony). Racists might like any job, but also any job that gives them a chance to use their racism in exchange for money probably appeals more.
@Dat_Boi_Dalton @SirLarr Didn't say that's all border patrol people do. But I did say that the job probably appeals to racists. You don't think it's plausible that racists might want this sort of job?
@joesphVoid @havlochtakacs @SirLarr If they don't want to be shadow banned, they should try not saying racist shit.
@joesphVoid @havlochtakacs @SirLarr Calling undocumented Americans "illegals" is racist as hell. Talking up crimes committed by them to create the false impression that they're more dangerous than natural born citizens is the same thing Hitler did to breed resentment towards Jews, and is thus racist.
@Dat_Boi_Dalton @SirLarr You don't think maybe people who want to kill Hispanic people would be more likely to sign up for a job that presents a greater opportunity to kill Hispanic people with no repercussions?

@RealTurfmann @jimminysnicket8 @ExpNegLambdaT @DanCrenshawTX I love well regulated, appropriately taxed capitalism. I don't have any sympathy for people who have more money than they could literally ever spend and still want more. Every dollar that goes to them instead of the lower and middle classes is wage theft.
@RealTurfmann @jimminysnicket8 @ExpNegLambdaT @DanCrenshawTX You aren't really creating wealth if all the money is going to the already wealthy. Seriously. Capital in the 21st Century by Thomas Picketty. Give it a read.
@RealTurfmann @jimminysnicket8 @ExpNegLambdaT @DanCrenshawTX The government's purpose is to take care of it's citizenry. Letting a handful of psychopaths hoard all the money is not in the interest of the vast majority of the country. Google "infinite accumulation."
@RealTurfmann @jimminysnicket8 @ExpNegLambdaT @DanCrenshawTX It's employed by corporations. People don't pay their employees out of their personal income, they use money held by the company. Personal income tax doesn't apply to corporations. Do you really not understand that?
@jimminysnicket8 @ExpNegLambdaT @RealTurfmann @DanCrenshawTX No. There is a finite amount of money in the world. The savings of the 1% so greatly exceed their expenditures that money flows to the top and calcifies. All the money goes up, and then less comes down. Repeat that for a couple centuries. It's Econ 101.
@jimminysnicket8 @ExpNegLambdaT @RealTurfmann @DanCrenshawTX There's decades of proof that growth can occur in high taxes, and it's immoral to let rich people hoard all the resources since they don't spend at the same rate as they earn. Look up infinite accumulation.
@jimminysnicket8 @ExpNegLambdaT @RealTurfmann @DanCrenshawTX Proof?
@jimminysnicket8 @ExpNegLambdaT @RealTurfmann @DanCrenshawTX This isn't a causal argument. You're saying that high tax rates and growth cannot co-exist, but they clearly did for a very long time. No one is arguing that the taxes caused the growth, only that the growth was not stopped by the existence of a tax.
@gporter0071 @RealTurfmann @ExpNegLambdaT @DanCrenshawTX It's pretty straightforward. What's twisted is how far backwards you're willing to bend over to help corporate America pick your pocket. Take an economics class sometime. Maybe you'll learn what every economist knows: trickle down is a scam.
@mortdiggiddy @gporter0071 @RealTurfmann @ExpNegLambdaT @DanCrenshawTX Are you aware of the post-WWII boom in America?
@mortdiggiddy @gporter0071 @RealTurfmann @ExpNegLambdaT @DanCrenshawTX Do you understand the difference between a corporate tax and a personal income tax? Employees are paid with corporate funds, and the marginal tax rate applies to individual income.
@gporter0071 @RealTurfmann @ExpNegLambdaT @DanCrenshawTX If I make $50,000/year, a flat tax of 20% leaves me with $40,000 to live off of. If I make $10,000,000/year, a flat tax of 90% would still leave me $1,000,000 to live on. Thus, the 90% tax is less burdensome on the millionaire than a 20% tax on a middle class worker.
@jimminysnicket8 @ExpNegLambdaT @RealTurfmann @DanCrenshawTX If your argument is that a high marginal tax rate hampers growth, that would be disproven by the fact that a high marginal tax rate has never hampered growth in the past.

@csingh7891 @mattyglesias I am focused on defeating Trump, but I'm also focused on long term reforms to protect popular will from the active sabotage of the American right. For what it's worth, I'm also very educated on this subject.
@BrianPlant11 @csingh7891 @mattyglesias Then let them leave. They're out of touch with the real America. I'm tired of backwoods racists leeching the resources of hard-working, capital-generating city folk.
@BrianPlant11 @csingh7891 @mattyglesias It's almost certainly aligned with the alt-right platform. This isn't a good faith question.
@csingh7891 @mattyglesias My last tweet was needlessly mean, so I deleted it and apologize for my tone. A representative democracy is a type of democracy. America is basically the only place on Earth that treats "republic" as separate from "democracy" because of a semantic thing James Madison did once.
@BrianPlant11 @csingh7891 @mattyglesias Then let it fail. If the red states think they can survive without the massive government welfare they get from the blue states, they're welcome to give it a try. The blue states have all the people and jobs. That's real America.
@BrianPlant11 @csingh7891 @mattyglesias California has 40 million people in it. Montana has 1 million. Thus, California is 40 times more American than Montana. Of course, what you really mean is that the majority of people's opinions don't count because they're different than your opinion.
@BrianPlant11 @csingh7891 @mattyglesias The states with all the people in them are "out of touch" with what America is and wants? Buddy, the cities ARE America. They provide all of the nation's resources. Montana can leave and starve if they want. They're just leeching off California and New York.
@csingh7891 @mattyglesias "Republic" is a synonym for "representative democracy," my guy. Additionally, no one said that when Obama won because the popular vote, a more moral factor, lined up with the outcome of the electoral college, unlike Trump's win, which is a direct refusal of popular will.
@csingh7891 @mattyglesias I think maybe the point is that the election system is broken and undemocratic.

@MarkLTomlin @BaltoSpectator I don't respect your opinion though. It doesn't deserve it. Do whatever makes you feel good, buddy, but when another school gets shot up and more children, spend some time thinking about the original legality of the gun used to do it.
@NewYorker Why do you keep letting Richard Brody review movies when he clearly hates cinema as a whole?
@MarkLTomlin @BaltoSpectator And since we're at it, yes I do think we should disarm "lawful citizens." I think we should repeal the second amendment and disarm everyone. Most illegally acquired guns start out as legally acquired guns. It is not possible to have easy legal access to guns and no gun crime.
@MarkLTomlin @BaltoSpectator No, you dipshit. It's to take unused guns out of circulation. If these guns are old and the owners never use them, what's the point of keeping them other than some pseudo-patriotic bullshit? It's really good that you care more about guns than people though. A true American.
@MarkLTomlin @BaltoSpectator I think the point of the gun buy back is to diminish the possibility of a home robbery resulting in the acquisition of a fire arm. For people who don't ever use their guns, it makes sense to sell it and guarantee it won't ever be stolen.

@DiaperFire @PeterSullivan4 Sure it does. If repealing the mandate means repealing the whole ACA, then Congress does not have the authority to enact at least some of the ACA sans-mandate under the interstate commerce clause, which is obviously untrue.
@DiaperFire @PeterSullivan4 And that's obviously wrong. Congress has the power to legislate requirements on businesses. Even if a tax doesn't exist to fund subsidies to insurance companies, Congress can still mandate that insurance plans follow the rest of the law.
@DiaperFire @PeterSullivan4 And that's obviously ridiculous. Considering the ACA unconstitutional on the basis that repealing the mandate was unconstitutional makes zero sense. This is a shit ruling, and it's obvious to anyone with any sense.

As it stands, my understanding is that Obama was not arresting immigrant children as criminals.
@fk_eduardo @NateSilver538 Then we'll never get anywhere, and you'll be, in part, to blame. Kids are being stolen from their families, people are dying of preventable disease, and inequality is worsening. You let it happen because you wouldn't settle for anything less than perfect.
@fk_eduardo @NateSilver538 I agree with that. I also got needlessly shitty with you. I do think that progress is going to have to be incremental and that when the time comes to vote between Trump and a centrist, I'm going to vote for the centrist.
@MNboyinCali @fk_eduardo @NateSilver538 I think this guy's a dummy, but I agree with him that neoliberalism isn't sustainable. It eventually and inevitably leads to severe inequality. A strong regulatory and tax policy to prevent infinite accumulation and (relatively) evenly distribute a society's wealth are vital.
@fk_eduardo @NateSilver538 By refusing to vote for the lesser of two evils, you're an active supporter of the worse evil. Your strategy hasn't prevented Trump or moved the country left at all.

@fk_eduardo @NateSilver538 I see that you're unwilling or unable to be rationale. Your attitude is why Trump won. If you're truly a progressive, you vote for the person who can move the ball downfield even if he can't score the touchdown. Purity is a loser's game.

@melissacarty @wsucpa @NateSilver538 I agree that narrative control is important, but a Warren candidacy makes it harder because it means we have to beat an existing narrative.
@wsucpa @melissacarty @NateSilver538 It's more important to me that Dems control the White House than it is that we make a stand about narrative control.
@melissacarty @NateSilver538 I don't dispute that, but I think there's enough risk there that she may not be the wisest choice. My priority is a Democratic victory. I think other candidates, perhaps Beto, do a better job of uniting the party, generating turn-out, and avoiding motivating opposition.
@melissacarty @NateSilver538 I believe you, and I respect your efforts and your knowledge. I guess I mean that as far as the DC insider opinion goes, moderates here, including Dem hill staff, have a lot of animosity towards her and the left-er wing of the party generally.
@melissacarty @NateSilver538 I respect your opinion, though I feel I have better knowledge of the party attitude in this one instance. I work in non-profit lobbying in DC, and at least among the moderate party operatives that I know, there's pretty strong vitriol.
@melissacarty @d_mastalir @NateSilver538 I think there's a problem of having too crowded a primary. That's how we got Trump, after all. Moderate Republicans split among the other 15 candidates, and the extremists consistently delivered for Trump.
@melissacarty @NateSilver538 It sucks, but it's reality. With how much the right hates Warren and how much many moderate Dems hate her, I think she poses a significant turn-out problem to Dem 2020 prospects.
@melissacarty @NateSilver538 If you want Trump to win a second term, sure we should ignore this. I'm not saying any conservative will vote Dem, I'm saying certain candidates will make more conservatives show up to vote GOP. I'm talking about base turn-out, not swing voters.
@melissacarty @NateSilver538 The CFPB is a big one. She says a lot of anti-free market stuff that really fires up conservatives I know. When she was first running for Senate, I lived in a very conservative place, and they hated her for saying small stuff like "Rich people should pay taxes."
@melissacarty @d_mastalir @NateSilver538 I'm not talking about "getting" MAGA people. My point is that Warren mobilizes MAGA people against her. She increases turnout among the GOP. I also think there's a lot of undeserved animosity towards her from moderate Dems. Strategically, she might not be a good candidate.
@d_mastalir @melissacarty @NateSilver538 Not exactly, but "electability" is at least worth consideration.
@melissacarty @NateSilver538 I'm a big fan of Warren, and I think she does good work. The problem is that she has a lot of baggage because of that good work. She's a constant target, much like Hillary. She doesn't deserve it, but she mobilizes opposition. Someone with less of a political history doesn't.

@GreggBurtnett @tedcruz How many straight months of job growth have we had? Who was the president during the first month of that trend?
Pissed https://t.co/mGoAR0lmKM
@GreggBurtnett @tedcruz All of the "good" trends under Trump began during the Obama years following the recession. That's indisputable. But the economists I'm referring to are research economists who publish peer-reviewed papers. You should read them sometime. You live in a fantasy land.
@MCW64563927 @marygold776 @tedcruz Consider, for a moment, that you could have the same level of care at a lower personal cost through universal healthcare. The only difference is that you would be giving your money to the government instead of a corporation that actively is trying to avoid paying for your care.
@rita_frnc @StevenErtelt @tedcruz I don't think anyone respectable said it would tank, but if you don't recognize that Trump's economic policies are bad, you don't know anything about economics. Presidents have a limited effect on the economy as it is, but the trade war with China helps no one.
How about Bremain https://t.co/svWVeEtV3H
@GreggBurtnett @tedcruz My point is that the Kansas experiment in conservative economics ended in pretty complete failure. The stimulus spending, necessitated by the failure of conservative economics, is widely regarded by economists to have had a moderate degree of success, with some complications.
@WayneTCG @hillary3197 @tedcruz I think you literally don't understand how universal healthcare works. No one under that system is forced to have insurance. Hospitals are reimbursed by the government. The current need for profit drives up healthcare costs, which is immoral.
@GreggBurtnett @tedcruz That's patently untrue. You should probably do more research from reputable outlets before you pretend to be an expert on something.
@MCW64563927 @marygold776 @tedcruz I'm happy to replace my current health insurance costs with an income-based tax to help provide basic care to all Americans.
@WayneTCG @hillary3197 @tedcruz OK, what happens if you need an emergency appendectomy? That's a $30,000 procedure. What happens if you're living paycheck to paycheck and can't afford even $100? You have a very shortsighted view of health costs.

@charliefiver @CarrieMPruett @GovernorVA @amazon Bruh, it's not your community, so you don't matter at all to this discussion.
@charliefiver @CarrieMPruett @GovernorVA @amazon Sure you do.
@charliefiver @CarrieMPruett @GovernorVA @amazon Yeah, I live in the community that's going to be hurt by HQ2, unlike you. I feel pretty good about worrying my middle class neighborhood will suffer from a housing crisis.
@charliefiver @CarrieMPruett @GovernorVA @amazon Sure, dude.
@charliefiver @CarrieMPruett @GovernorVA @amazon Dude, no. You're just not really impacted by this because you aren't part of the community. My rent is gonna explode because of this. That's obviously terrible for me. I don't know why you feel like dying on this hill.
@CarrieMPruett @charliefiver @GovernorVA @amazon I'm almost positive that he lives in a small town like three hours away from DC. In my Arlington neighborhood, houses start at $300k if you're super lucky and only need 1 bed/1 bath.
@fia012 @airickgee @GovernorVA @amazon That's a lot of jobs to inject suddenly. They're also highly paid jobs, which will raise the median income and also costs of living. The issue is that this will outpace existing structures for accommodating cost of living increases.
@ArlingtonVA @CassAGood @GovernorVA @amazon @BarbaraFavola @RipSullivan48 You know that 2,000 is less than the 25,000 new workers, right?
@TScowcro @ArlingtonVA @CassAGood @GovernorVA @amazon @BarbaraFavola @RipSullivan48 Thanks for your sympathy, and I'm sorry that Jeff Bezos has already hurt your city.
@charliefiver @CarrieMPruett @GovernorVA @amazon And if you don't mind me asking, where in NoVA do you live that you have a 100k house? In the area I live, which is very close to the HQ2 location, there are no houses that cheap. I suspect that you live far enough away that this won't impact you like it will me.
@charliefiver @CarrieMPruett @GovernorVA @amazon It's obvious that you don't get how significantly different our positions in the housing sphere are. Regardless of how minimal your benefit is, I have no benefit at all. Do you get that?
@charliefiver @CarrieMPruett @GovernorVA @amazon I'm not saying it's your fault, but you clearly aren't understanding how this will negatively impact a significant portion of your community. And you've started name calling, so you should probably take a break.
@bc_wallace You're killing my middle class.
Isn't that your plan too? https://t.co/6x1tsjmv97
@charliefiver @CarrieMPruett @GovernorVA @amazon Can't you be concerned about me as a renter?
@charliefiver @CarrieMPruett @GovernorVA @amazon You fundamentally misunderstand the issue if you think your ability to exploit housing cost increases and my inability to afford them are the same.
@bc_wallace And since the other half is in my neighborhood, I can't afford to live here anymore! Another win for the middle class!
@charliefiver @CarrieMPruett @GovernorVA @amazon OK, well the cons are that my middle class neighborhood will be largely displaced. Despite renting, you seem not to have much of a grasp on the economics involved.
@charliefiver @GovernorVA @amazon Do you live five minutes away from where HQ2 will be? I do, so the effect will be drastic. This will not be the normal increase in costs.
@charliefiver @GovernorVA @amazon Amazon will bring in mamy high paying jobs, so our landlords will drive rent up higher than I can afford but can be afforded by the highly paid Amazon workers. Increases aren't new, but this will be a huge increase that my cost of living adjustment won't be able to keep up with.
@bc_wallace We're so lucky.
@ArlingtonVA @CassAGood @GovernorVA @amazon @BarbaraFavola @RipSullivan48 I live on Columbia Pike. What are you going to do to prevent my rent from skyrocketing?
@Realjpdenver @hli016 @GovernorVA @amazon I mean, I'm pretty pissed that it's going to drive up my rent and force me out of the neighborhood I love. But who cares about the middle class anyways?
@airickgee @fia012 @GovernorVA @amazon My home is an apartment, so all it will do is drive up my rent. And even if it weren't, raising the value of a house increases taxes and prevents other similarly incomed people from moving into the neighborhood. Businesses will raise prices, too.
@charliefiver @GovernorVA @amazon Housing cost increases will probably drive me out of my home. I live near where this is happening. There's a human cost here.
@fia012 @GovernorVA @amazon This will cause housing prices to skyrocket and traffic to worsen. I'll probably lose my home as a result of this.
@GovernorVA @amazon Governor, this will likely force me out of home. I live five minutes away, just one metro stop, from Crystal City. This is killing the middle class.

@DankaliciousNug @AxelDraconi @AwerageGuy @SirLarr @LarrySharpe @ScrewAttackChad @JoelHeyman Or rather, without ignoring that the left has its problems, stating the fact that the right is far worse. Acting like Lawrence or anyone is turning a blind eye because they couldn't fit an all encompassing analysis of political corruption into one tweet is childish.

@Julia94883742 @JamesRoday @blknaab @11lbsplus3ft If you think Professor Ford did this, making every attempt to stay anonymous, assuming she'd be the recipient of a million dollar donation, you're a fool.

@Julia94883742 @JamesRoday @blknaab @11lbsplus3ft It's obviously true. Professor Ford wouldn't subject herself to this over a lie. The President of the United States is mocking her on TV, for crying out loud.
@rjkelley0528 @JamesRoday Kavanaugh ruined his own life when he decided to sexually assault all of those women.
@Julia94883742 @JamesRoday @blknaab @11lbsplus3ft I'll give you one guess as to why it was seriously leveled against Kavanaugh and not against James Roday.
@blknaab @JamesRoday @Fly2msl That's a legal standard, dude. Kavanaugh wasn't on trial. He wasn't being found guilty or not guilty. There's no presumption of innocence outside a court of law. He's a liar, no matter what, and he shouldn't be on the Supreme Court.

@alwaysboomin412 @Strider_3029 @DylanDelphen @sorola The FBI conducts background investigations into Supreme Court nominees. It was sent them as part of that process.
@alwaysboomin412 @Strider_3029 @DylanDelphen @sorola Accusing people of not knowing something is pretty ironic given that you only seem to know about 20% of the story. GOP leadership and the FBI also had the letter.
@_silversmith @tomperriello McConnell wouldn't schedule a vote without knowing the outcome. Given the political damage of confirming Kavanaugh, which McConnell surely recognizes, I think his plan is to vote Kavanaugh down because he wouldn't withdraw and have Amy Coney Barrett nominated instead.
@tomperriello I honestly think that's what's happening, especially given Murkowski's statements. Probably nominate Amy Coney Barrett from the 7th Circuit afterwards and get her confirmed relatively quickly.
@FLORYnguover @sorola I love how you're pretending the issue here is the literal number of days.
@alwaysboomin412 @ry_marshall @sorola Do you recognize that sexual crimes often do leave any evidence other than witness testimony?
@alwaysboomin412 @Hibiki_arts @atriaventrica @sorola This is an excuse for idiots like you to ignore that your worldview perpetuates racism and inequality.
@DylanDelphen @alwaysboomin412 @sorola Do you realize that Prof. Ford asked for the letter to be kept confidential and did not want to be publicly identified? They didn't "come forward with it now." They gave it to the FBI and GOP leadership as soon as they got it, and the GOP didn't care until it was public.
