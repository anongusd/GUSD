@Ngwako73 It is sad you listen to someone who will lead you into a Zimbabwe situation in less than five years. Who is going to get the land? His friends? Who is going to feed you when there is nothing to eat. Malema does not know how to farm or get investments. Take and Burn- what future?
@Ngwako73 Why after 25 years to you still blaming the whites I ask? You are 25 behind instead of ahead. This excuse is getting old. Even if you take all the land, close all the whites down who is go to pay? Just look at every country that has adapted the same failed ideas of the EFF. https://t.co/dxMKHxu5Vd
@Ngwako73 Do you honestly believe the international community is going to invest in a country run by the EFF who have violated the SA constitution and the rule of law. Advocates the stealing of property. What Malema has not told you yet is he is the puppet of the British Masters.

There is avid avocation by the South African Government with the financial help of the British Government @theresa_may to help persecute, discriminate and steal the legitimate the White citizens of South Africans of dignity and land.
The average murder rate as of present is approximately 33000 a year. An average rape every three minutes as young as three. In conclusion the South African ANC has no control over the country due to rampant corruption from the top to the lowest officials.
free. Some of these were murdering and raping within 24 hours of being released. Well over 100,000 people were murdered under Mandela's term as president. This number has reached far over 70k whites and rapidly climbing. All minorities are being attacked daily.
That's 170 people per year. Under Nelson Mandela's presidency an average of 25,000 people were murdered each year. Yet, to celebrate his birthdays, Nelson Mandela would regularly open prison doors and set many convicted criminals, including armed robbers, murderers and rapists,
What this means is that during the apartheid years of 41 years, 7 000 blacks died in violence, mostly at the hands of rioters &amp; ANC revolutionaries, compared to double the amount of dead in just 4 years! So, officially, 170 black people were killed under apartheid ANNUALLY.
Of the 14 000 killed during those 4 years, over 92% of deaths were caused by blacks killing blacks. Only 5.6% were attributed to the Security Forces at the time and usually in retaliation to attacks initiated by the ANC/UDF that had been unbanned.
AFTER the unbanning of the ANC, and for all intents and purposes apartheid had ended, was 14 000, involving mostly black on black violence between the ANC and the IFP and various other factions!
One from 1948 till 1989 and the next from 1990 to the election in 1994. The number killed for the period from 1948 until 1989 is 7k. That means the number killed from 1990 to 1994 which is .....
The statistics they proffered relate to the number of blacks killed between the years 1948 up to the election in 1994. The total number of blacks killed were 21 000.The HRC report also made a distinction between two periods. 	....
Do we know how many Black people were killed under apartheid-We do, and the source is none other than the Human Rights Commission submitted as evidence to the TRC in 1997 Continues.....next tweet https://t.co/ljvTowF40A

yourselves. The example of your future is Zimbabwe. Say no more. The truth and reconciliation commission &amp; research done by a black professor in CT stated only 21K were killed during apartheid but today 33K a year, 1 x rape x 3mins etc etc etc. @Smart_Black_ZA @_realBlackTrump
in a common cause. Remove these parasites, Like Zuma, Ramaphosa, Malema &amp; co. Vote them all out in May and then arrest them &amp; make them open their bank accounts over seas to put it all back from where the stole it. Stop the farm killings because all you doing is killing
I honestly believe that there are moderates of all races in South Africa with conservative values who are sick &amp; tired of the same brutality, murder, rape, robbery, rampant corruption from politicians to the police, lack of education. The repeat of every African Nation. Unite

@Mngxitama We want you to come to the Netherlands to the international court in the Hague and present your case on who really owns the land in southern Africa. I promise you a safe passage there and home. If you can prove your case then I will back you 1000%.
@Mngxitama Everyone outside South Africa knows you are a servant to the ANC. Yes Bass No Bass like your little coward friend Malema who now hides behind the security. Funny thing is it is not the whites that will in the end fix you it will be the very people black people you lying too.
@Mngxitama Do you have a short memory or maybe you don't even know this man who once thought he too was so powerful. Saddam Hussein of Iraq. I was there when they hanged him too still screaming his evil on the way down the rope.
@Mngxitama Why are you so scared then? You are scared of a few white woman, Children and their dogs and pets? Do you honestly believe the rest of the world will invest if you were the leader of South Africa? No because you have never been out side to see the real power.

If you do not arrest he leader of BLF, Andile Mngxitama and Julius Malema of the EFF and any Whites are killed because of his actions we will hold the ANC government responsible and the entire leadership of the police in South Africa.
We go LIVE on FB at 1 pm USA time with Gary Clarke from an organization in Europe about the Genocide happening in South Africa. Please if anyone can contact our great President Donald Trump,Tucker Carson, Peter Savage we need the world to know. SHARE AND LET US MAKE THIS MASSIVE
Looking for people in the USA, Australia, Canada, Russia and the rest of the world who are organized to support South Africans against the genocide to contact me and lets do a live feed so we bring this horror to the worlds attention.
Let the IPF and Zulu King Know. There are seven million tons of coal about to be shipped the China on 36 ships. While the people are suffering with no electricity. The ANC government has sold you to the Chinese. Be the heroes of the nation and deny them the coal and take it back
So when the innocent in the 21st century are punished for the crimes of the 16th, 17th and 18th who punishes the punishes now later? Hawk 2008

@Rev_Blackheart_ In the end there will be no other way. I pray no one sees what I have seen in my life. I am fighting to avoid this horror.
To the ANC, EFF, BLF &amp; other foolish people. You are all very brave now until you see what is really above you right now. Do not make this mistake because they are waiting next door believe me.
Wake up and join your countrymen and be one Nation one race human or die fighting each other like the old African story about fighting over the chicken and the dog takes the meat.
No one understands this law did not say white it said land reform that mean you are all going to be owned by a communist government run by the Chinese.
The UN definition of Genocide Explain the 70000 white murders since 1994. Understand the logic you kill the white man in your own country &amp; your Government goes the same white men in Europe &amp; wants more to be invested in a country that wants to take all the white man's property?
@RSATruth @j9wasp Send me locations
In the last 50 years did anyone get this right. No because you were all divided by hate to control you. Believe me and remember my words this day. The international community will remove the ANC, EFF and BLF if they continue down this path.
I have seen many many wars in my life time and no one wins. Everything you believe now will mean nothing when you holding the ashes of your people in your hands both black and white. You are being feed hatred by people who want your vote to rape you all once again.
No black man today in the international court can prove they own any land in the 16th century when the white man arrived. Your point is nothing but racism.
You are all being fooled. The black man, the white man and any person born there by international law has a human right to live there because despite what happened in the 16th century it doesn't apply.
In so doing know the South African government will default on their loans &amp; they will be your bosses.
When you have taken away all the farms and devastated your tax base the country is gone. Your hatred has helped the Chinese buy up your infrastructures &amp; they know most of South does not pay there bills.
This is the 21st Cent and money talked. The only other country willing to deal with ANC is China. They slowly corrupted them will money and blackmail. If the ANC was as good as you believe every man woman &amp; child could have had a new nice house with the money stolen from Eskom.
The international court in the international court Hague have formally start proceeding to to charge both the ruling parties for crimes against Humanity.
After spending a good ten years with the US military I can tell you South Africa would last a half a day and all these so called brave people who like to kill innocent weak white people will find out the hard way.
In the EU Ramaphosa was rejected by both Germany and Russia. Germany and Russia control all the trade from there. Ramaphosa was further rejected by the United States and made a grave mistake of threatening President Trump.
It always surprises me how little we know. If you honestly believe that black people will get rid of white people and white people will get rid of black people then you all need to go back to school. The world woke up the other day. No one in the ANC,  will govern very soon.
