Trump needs to make it crystal clear: If Turkey purchases the Russian S-400 system from Putin, it will not receive the F-35. Period. Turkey must not be allowed to compromise the safety of our pilots and the security of NATO. Do they want to quit NATO? https://t.co/pp0DuSFTG8

At this moment of growing harm from climate change, appointing someone to lead the EPA who has vigorously opposed our efforts to reduce carbon pollution.... would be like putting the Monopoly Man in charge of regulating big banks. I'm voting no on Andrew Wheeler to head the EPA.
History was made today in the House. A bill to ensure universal background checks passed 240-190—including some Republicans! For all the sweat, tears, and activism that often felt hopeless—this is an example of why speaking out matters. Next? Time for the Senate to follow suit.
I was watching the Michael Cohen hearing closely today and will do everything in my power to get to the truth. But one person we can be grateful for right now: @RepCummings. We are lucky to have him representing Maryland as the Chairman of the House Oversight Committee.

I will vote no on William Barr. Before he was nominated, he wrote a memo undermining the legitimacy of Mueller’s probe. He can’t be trusted to be impartial or ensure that we all see the Special Counsel's findings. Our Attorney General must respect the law, not put Trump above it.
John, we both know that the shutdown happened because the President walked away from Mr. McConnell's bipartisan funding bill in December—and he was proud to do it. Let's not try to rewrite history, let's just get it done. After all, TX gets more federal contract dollars than MD. https://t.co/xOsGNXQVrm
I certainly hope this isn’t true. It would be cruel and unnecessary to block back pay for federal contract workers who lost more than a month of wages and are still behind on bills due to President Trump’s shutdown.

Last night, @SenatorCardin and I introduced a bipartisan funding bill to reopen the government for 3 weeks, get federal workers paid and back to work, and move forward with negotiations. President Trump now supports this idea. Let’s get this voted on today and get back to work.
I filed an amendment with a bipartisan group of senators—Cardin, Graham, Warner, Murkowski, Kaine, and others—to fund the government for the next three weeks.

Day 34 of the Trump Shutdown. Under the direction of the President, Senate Republicans blocked a proposal to reopen the government until February 8th. This would have allowed federal employees to get back to work and receive their back pay while we work out a long-term solution.
This Administration is so out of touch. There was a long line at @chefjoseandres’ food bank yesterday, and the same is true across my state.

President Trump kowtowed to Putin. Now he's taking orders from Erdogan to withdraw our forces from Syria so Turkey can attack the Kurds—our key ally in the fight against ISIS. While Trump shuts down the government, he has undermined our national security once again. https://t.co/m0N2GsZskN
The government just shut down because the President threw a temper tantrum to satisfy conservative talking heads, and Republicans let him get away with it. This is not normal and will hurt both our government and our economy. Congressional Republicans need to stop this madness.
The government shuts down at midnight. I gave an update to @chrislhayes on the latest in our fight to keep the government open and ensure that federal employees are not punished for political dysfunction they had nothing to do with! https://t.co/T7wLCaJO0k
Just got back. The Senate has passed our bill to make sure our federal workforce will still get paid if there's a shutdown. The House should pass it immediately. But there doesn’t need to shutdown.

President Trump said he would be “proud” to shut down the government. Now, as always, he wants to duck responsibility.

Paul Ryan should be ashamed that in his final act as Speaker he has again become a pawn of President Trump. Why not allow a vote on a bipartisan Senate bill and let democracy work in the House? Why do the President’s bidding? This is a cowardly way to govern.
Mr. President, yesterday you said we had defeated ISIS. Today you say that Russia is unhappy because they will have to fight ISIS. The reality is Russia, Turkey, and others are happy you abandoned our key partners in the fight against ISIS, the Syrian Kurds. Weak. https://t.co/gMTupKJEv2
We had a bipartisan vote in the Senate to keep the government open. In his final days, Speaker Ryan must do the right thing and let democracy work its will. House Republicans should not be minions of Trump, scampering down to the White House. Pass the bill and stop the shutdown! https://t.co/PDCFmr1EJK
Trump has refused to provide federal employees with a modest cost of living increase. That’s why I am still pushing to get a COLA passed before January 1st. If that is blocked, then it should be a priority for early next year. Civil servants aren't the President’s punching bag.
It's been four years since I traveled to Cuba to bring @AlanPGross home. Even after five years in a Cuban prison, he never lost hope and was a catalyst for opening a new chapter with Cuba. Now he is fighting back against Trump’s efforts to reverse the progress that was made. https://t.co/EO1KN9qH24

First, the GOP cuts taxes for billionaires and big corporations with no way to pay for it—adding trillions in debt. Now they want to cut Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security. Translation: the rich and powerful come first while kids, working Americans, and seniors come last. https://t.co/n4EN2mISJX
Pompeo’s job is to get the truth out—not to huddle with the Saudi regime to help them whitewash their heinous crime. The only thing they planned to “rendition” was Khashoggi’s body. Otherwise, why do you need a bone saw? The U.S. must not be complicit in this cover-up. https://t.co/OeSum0f9mB
Think about this for a second: The President of the United States is being used as the mouthpiece by the Saudi regime to cover up the murder of a US-based journalist. This Administration must sanction those responsible and suspend arms sales—not parrot the regime’s propaganda. https://t.co/sNiNORrQo8
Hungry Harvest has an incredible backstory. After coming up with the concept in his dorm basement, Evan Lutz struggled to get investors but didn’t give up. Now, they have over 40 employees and have reduced 9M pounds of food from going to the landfill. Keep up the good work! https://t.co/zDgCVdRVFA
It’s astonishing that the GOP continues to label themselves as “deficit hawks.” For years, they’ve been spreading this false narrative that tax cuts for billionaires and big corporations are going to trickle down to the middle class. Turns out, it saddles them with debt instead. https://t.co/kB7oa13i8q
President Trump’s suggestion that Khashoggi’s elaborately planned murder in the Saudi’s own consulate was orchestrated by “rogue killers” defies reality. Orders must have come from the top. The U.S. must not be complicit in an effort to cover-up this heinous crime. https://t.co/qJkBZ1sPG8

Yesterday, we passed a resolution that I introduced with @SenatorCardin to honor Senator Joe Tydings. Every single Senator—Democrat and Republican—supported it. It’s a small way to pay our respects to a man who was a progressive champion and great public servant. https://t.co/urEAeh83O4
It’s good news that Pastor Brunson has been released. But he is not the only one who has been unjustly imprisoned. We shouldn't lift sanctions on Turkish officials until Erdogan frees all innocent Americans and the Turkish nationals who’ve served in our embassies and consulates.
The proof is in the numbers. 		Wages are stagnant—corporate profits are skyrocketing. 	Workers did not get $4,000 raises—special interests got windfalls. 	The middle class is not better off—billionaires are doing great. 		That’s the legacy of the Trump Tax Scheme. https://t.co/BMO3Acq6W3
Today, we’re introducing a bipartisan bill to prohibit foreign adversaries from owning and controlling the companies supporting our elections. It’s called the Protect Our Elections Act. We need to get this done!
That’s why I’ve teamed up with @SenatorCollins and @SenatorCardin to stop this kind of activity dead in its tracks.
This exposed a major problem that we are committed to solving. Our free and fair elections are central to our democracy, and we must ensure that the nuts and bolts of our election systems are secure.

Facts matter. President Trump must order a full FBI investigation into all of the allegations against Kavanaugh without delay. Leader McConnell must wait for the results of that investigation before there is any vote on the Senate floor. The truth is nonpartisan. https://t.co/TSHLnQ5anD
Judge Kavanaugh’s meltdown was the angriest and most partisan performance a Supreme Court nominee has ever delivered. How can the public ever have confidence that he would judge impartially on controversial issues that come before the court?
I find it very odd that Republicans kept pressing the point that an FBI investigation doesn’t make a final determination. That’s not the point—the point is that we need all the details before we vote. Why would anyone want to vote on a lifetime appointment without all the facts?
Today we heard the powerful, courageous, and credible testimony of Dr. Ford. Judge Kavanaugh called it all “an orchestrated political hit” as if her awful experience was manufactured by Democrats. But he refused to call for an FBI investigation. Stop the politics—cancel the vote.

I couldn’t agree more, Mark. We voted this measure down today, but it won’t be the last time there’s a partisan attack on women’s health. We must keep the public aware about what’s at stake if we don’t protect funding for Planned Parenthood. https://t.co/XNEzPOYfNm

President Trump is telling folks not to trust the statements of his long-time personal lawyer Michael Cohen. But Cohen has testified under penalty of perjury while Trump has refused. Mr. President, why are you so afraid to testify under oath to Mueller?
Turkey buying the Russian S-400 missile defense system would threaten the security of our F-35 aircraft and let Putin collect critical intelligence on us.

This has never been a witch hunt or a hoax—today’s guilty verdict of Manafort and the plea deal of Cohen show that these investigations are uncovering real wrongdoing. It's more important than ever to stand up for the rule of law and protect the integrity of these investigations.

Dear @realDonaldTrump: if you are determined to proceed with the Putin meeting, at least demand that the Russians indicted today be extradited to the U.S. to stand trial for interfering with our elections. Don't be a Putin patsy. Stand up for America and our democracy!
With four months until the midterms, that has to change. We must pass the bipartisan DETER Act to send a powerful message to any foreign actor seeking to disrupt our elections: if you attack American candidates, campaigns, or voting infrastructure, you will face consequences.
Russian attacks on our democracy are not an abstract idea—they are a threat to Maryland and our entire country.
While there is no evidence that this has impacted Maryland elections to date, this news is deeply disturbing, and underscores the need for urgent action to prevent election interference—which Trump continues to ignore.
New from the @FBI: I just found out that the software vendor who maintains portions of the Maryland State Board of Elections voter registration platform was acquired in 2015 by a venture capitalist owned by a Russian oligarch.

Men, women, and children from across the world—including Muslim-majority countries—look at the United States as a beacon of hope and a symbol of freedom. We cannot allow Trump's bigotry to undermine America's fundamental values. https://t.co/KcY88J0zJO
Couldn't agree more with Justices Sotomayor and Ginsburg that this decision discounted Trump's malicious intent. In the Senate, I'm fighting to make sure the ban is not shrouded in secrecy and that people who present no threat are allowed entry into our country. https://t.co/QFN6kSAdlY

If you need some good news to brighten your day, the full Senate approved $5M in new funding to pay interns in the Senate. A big step toward helping level the playing field and provide opportunities for those students who don't have the financial means to live in DC without pay.
Trump tweeted that he was "surprised" that Harley-Davidson is moving some jobs and manufacturing overseas. Really? The guy who claimed to be a great negotiator is having his lunch eaten. The Art of the Deal has become the Art of the Steal—stealing American jobs.
Five years ago, the Supreme Court inflicted a serious blow to the Voting Rights Act. Since then, we’ve seen countless attempts to suppress voting rights—including the bad ruling issued today. We must keep fighting to expand access to the ballot box. #RestoreTheVRA https://t.co/CMMnNeE3al
Trump constantly belittles our hardworking federal workforce and proposed a pay freeze even though the cost of living is rising. I’m glad we stood up for our civil servants by voting to give them a modest pay raise. This is an important step but the fight is not over. https://t.co/kv5k6rJbCm
It's been 6 months since Trump added $2 trillion to our debt with his corporate tax giveaway. Since then, big corporations and wealthy stockholders have reaped windfall profits while middle-class wages have remained stagnant. A very bad deal for America. https://t.co/bNy9e8AQMF

Trump vowed not to touch Medicare and Medicaid—so much for that promise. After giving huge tax cuts to big corporations and saddling us with trillions in debt, the GOP wants to gut these vital programs. This budget is no surprise—but working families deserve the truth. https://t.co/sAi1jrBF9h

While Trump finally bent to public pressure to reverse his despicable child separation policy, his new order does nothing to reunite children who have been taken from their parents and appears to subject children to indefinite imprisonment. Unacceptable. This still isn’t over. https://t.co/aY08lPtJrG
I don’t care how many times the President denies it—he is deliberately separating children from their parents and holding them hostage as a political bargaining tool. Despicable. He has the power to end his inhumane family separation policy with one phone call. https://t.co/bm0WX2dKCB
The Senate passed the amendment I offered with @SenTomCotton to keep the penalties on ZTE for its violations of U.S sanctions. We are pleased that both parties made clear clear that protecting American jobs and national security must come first. Trump should end his opposition.
Trump keeps saying we need new immigration laws to change his cruel family separation policy. Totally false. He ordered it 6 weeks ago and he could end it today. He is holding these separated kids hostage to gain leverage in the larger immigration debate. Despicable!
Second, new DHS policy is making it almost impossible for families fleeing violence to seek asylum at legal ports of entry. So desperate moms hire folks to take them across the Rio Grande. Then—as described here—they are arrested and then their children are taken away. https://t.co/EaQUi4tyjv
Nielsen's claim here is very deceptive for 2 reasons: First, I spoke personally to a mom who crossed at a legal point of entry. She and her daughter were fleeing death threats in Honduras. Her daughter was taken away and she is now locked up in a detention center. https://t.co/4vJQUOYIRX
This morning, I met with Sister Norma at her Catholic Charities Center in McAllen. She is truly an angel, caring for desperate families fleeing horrific violence. As she and I discussed, the families who make it to her center are the "fortunate ones." https://t.co/gwhJQ7LLIk
Mr. President, I was for cracking down on MS-13 before you learned it wasn't a movie sequel—but at the border I saw 5-year-olds you have taken from their parents.

Traveling to next stop. Based on current trends, today, on Father's Day, about 45 children will be taken from their parents. Trump's policy has taken about 2,000 children from their parents in 6 weeks from April 18th and May 31st—and that cruel practice continues. It must stop!
At the Hidalgo Bridge. A few weeks ago, the Trump Administration essentially stopped families seeking asylum from crossing at this legal point of entry. Left people stranded for days without food and water. So many then crossed the river, were arrested and had children taken. https://t.co/iHCDevS1A1
President Trump says he has to take children from their families because of "Democratic" laws. That is a lie. There are NO laws that require this policy of family separation for asylum seekers. This is a deliberate Trumpian practice. He could end it today.

Our family celebrated Father’s Day yesterday because our children agreed it was important that today I travel to the border to meet with kids who can't be with their parents because they've been ripped apart by the Trump Admin's cruel new policy. Trump—stop this inhumane policy!
This Father’s Day, I’m headed to the border with @SenJeffMerkley to focus on the inhumanity of separating kids from their moms and dads when families are legally seeking asylum and get a first-hand look at what is happening. Follow along Sunday for updates from our trip.

To call him a 'tireless champion' of the 'rule of law'—shows disrespect for the law. Given his criminal conviction, he should be behind bars. https://t.co/cufSYFcImI
Tell your friends and neighbors that @SenateDems now have enough signatures to file a petition to force a vote to reinstate #NetNeutrality rules. We need ONE more vote to get to 51 and win. Keep the pressure up and tell all senators to stand with consumers and entrepreneurs. https://t.co/vdn529BY0v
We must reduce violent crime in Baltimore, and this federal partnership can help us. As noted here, last week Sessions told me he would reconsider the DOJ's earlier denial of assistance—and I will keep fighting to ensure Baltimore gets additional help for public safety. https://t.co/Ry1xnle2Kf
Never imagined myself saying this, but Tom Price is right. By repealing a central piece of the Affordable Care Act in their tax plan, Republicans are increasing health care costs for working people—all while giving billionaires tax cuts. Americans deserve the truth. https://t.co/UeqgrlRpFg
I was the guest on Dan’s podcast this week, I hope you’ll take a listen. I provided an update on the Republican tax plan, immigration issues, Iran deal, and why Sessions cannot exclude Baltimore from a federal grant to reduce violent crime. https://t.co/4b7Eo90r7m
As I said at the @TaxMarch, don't be fooled by the bill of goods Trump &amp; the GOP are peddling about their tax plan. The amounts going to stock buybacks for corporate executives, foreign stockholder and the wealthy are roughly 40 times the bonuses and wage hikes going to workers. https://t.co/sQv06SPHbb
This is not the growth rate Trump promised with his tax plan. His own @CommerceGov gives us proof that this plan is not supercharging the economy. Billionaires and corporations who donate to Republican campaigns got windfall tax cuts—while the rest of us got $2 trillion in debt. https://t.co/Cq8A6SukFs
Pompeo has a reckless "shoot first, ask questions later" attitude and is likely to reinforce, not check, Trump's worst instincts. And how can he represent American values abroad when he has made divisive comments about minority groups here at home? I voted no on his nomination. https://t.co/nsPRKHEtNb
This is a positive first step. Now McConnell should reconsider and allow a vote in the full Senate.  This isn’t a question of political party, it’s about the integrity of our democracy. https://t.co/ljd80C0vX4
Trump Swamp Monsters: the Director of the CONSUMER Protection Financial Bureau tells big banks that, as a Congressman, he only met with bank lobbyists who gave $$ to his campaign and they should buy more influence by contributing to members of Congress who will do their bidding. https://t.co/N5Iyqm2iZd
Trump’s travel ban only weakens our security by playing into the hands of our enemies. I have repeatedly pushed for more transparency but the Administration refuses to give us clear answers, particularly on the waiver process—an issue the Justices raised today.

Pruitt should be fired. That's the one thing Trump’s supposed to be good at, right? https://t.co/rTLeXDbBrh
Stunning. CBO analysis shows that Republicans are selling a false bill of goods with their tax plan. Over the next decade, nearly 45% of the income from the increased economic activity from these tax cuts flows to foreigners, not Americans—and by 2028, that number jumps to 71%. https://t.co/XcLvyikP1S

Pruitt’s conduct in office is a disgrace. He no longer holds the confidence of the American people, and his actions are examples of why many distrust the federal government. His gross misjudgment and poor leadership undermine the @EPA, and I believe he must resign.
Making sure you saw this @realDonaldTrump, @SenateMajLdr, and @SpeakerRyan. While big banks have been cashing out to the tune of billions of dollars, you’re turning around and asking working families to foot the bill. Why aren’t you tweeting about that? https://t.co/wqxj5u1qaO
A big salute to First Lady Barbara Bush for her commitment to public service and living a life of purpose. I had the honor of joining her in Maryland in support of the Foundation for Family Literacy, which she created. Condolences to the entire Bush family.
This is exactly why the Senate must pass the bipartisan #BRINKAct without any more delay. China’s biggest banks still launder money for North Korea, despite UN sanctions. My bill with @SenToomey would sanction those banks and ratchet up the pressure on Kim Jong Un. https://t.co/6JpXvF5Si2

With a President as reckless and unstable as Trump, we need a Secretary of State with a steady hand and a strategic mind. Pompeo is the opposite of what we need for this critical position.
From his positions on the Iran deal, to refugees, to torture, to climate change, to equality for all—Pompeo has shown he is fundamentally averse to diplomacy and lacks the skills needed for our chief diplomat.
I voted NO on Pompeo to head the CIA and I will vote NO on his nomination to be Secretary of State. He has a shoot first, ask questions later attitude on the use of force. He will reinforce, not check, Trump's worst instincts.
Stunning. Buried in @USCBO’s report is the tax scam’s impact on Gross National Product—which is a better measure of actual income for Americans. In 2028, 80% of the income from the economic activity driven by the tax cuts flows to foreigners rather than families here at home. https://t.co/MOj1zuLUJM

@SenCortezMasto Yet Congressional efforts to strengthen the laws against wage discrimination through the passage of bills like the #PaycheckFairnessAct have been blocked by Republicans.
@SenCortezMasto Exactly, @SenCortezMasto. Women are still only paid 80 cents for every dollar paid to a man, a yearly pay difference of $10,086. And the disparity is even worse for many women of color. #EqualPayDay
@SenCortezMasto It’s a national disgrace that the gender gap still exists in 2018. Equal pay isn’t just about fairness. It can mean the difference between being able to make ends meet, pay for childcare, or save for retirement.
Congratulations, @TammyDuckworth! Abigail and little Maile are so lucky to have you as a Mom and mentor. Wishing you all the best. https://t.co/aDOuKL9OUf

Demolition and rebuilding at the current site will also disrupt operations and send 20% of the workforce to locations across the country. It is a complete reversal from what the GSA and FBI have recommended previously, and Congress should reject this irresponsible proposal.

Hidden in Trump’s budget: An entirely immoral cut to food and nutrition programs for needy Americans. After giving millionaires and corporations big tax cuts, Trump now wants to take away $200B worth of food from low-income Americans. https://t.co/zPByWv5hJH
The other shoe drops: After borrowing $1.5 trillion to finance a tax cut for big corporations and millionaires, the Trump budget pays for it by cutting Medicare, Medicaid, and parts of Social Security. It doesn't forget the "forgotten Americans"—it makes their lives harder.
To be clear, this Trump budget is not about deficit reduction. Even after cooking to books, they still can’t even balance the budget. This is just a plan to stack the deck even more for the wealthy and powerful and against working families.
It’s a disaster for America’s leadership in the world, gutting the State Department while ramping up spending for nukes and the border wall.
It’s a disaster for our environment. It drastically limits the EPA’s ability to safeguard our environment and the Chesapeake Bay.
It’s a disaster for federal workers. It would cut federal retirement benefits by more than $150B over 10 years.
It’s a disaster for students. It would make it even harder for Americans to pay back their student loans, and eliminates programs to recruit and train top-notch teachers in public schools.
It’s a disaster for families struggling to make ends meet.  It would cut Social Security Disability Insurance—breaking Trump’s promise not to cut Social Security—and gut programs that help provide a basic standard of living for working families.
It’s a disaster for our health care system. It would repeal the ACA using the same tired Graham-Cassidy bill we defeated and leave 21M+ uninsured, on top of the 13M who would no longer have coverage due to the tax bill. It also takes a sledgehammer to Medicaid and Medicare.
Here’s my initial take on the President’s budget plan. I’ve worked on a number of budgets over the years, and I’ve never seen a budget so willing to squeeze working families in order to pay for a massive tax giveaway to the very wealthy and big corporations.

At every turn, Trump has broken promises to the middle class and made life harder for people in Maryland and across the country. #SOTU
The Administration’s unrelenting efforts to tear immigrant families apart and waste taxpayers’ money on an ineffective wall has put thousands of families in crisis. And in both word and deed, Trump has diminished our stature around the world and undermined our national security.
While Trump wants to take credit for every uptick in the stock market and one-time bonuses from major corporations, he refuses to acknowledge their sizeable layoffs and Wall Street paydays. #SOTU
He is quick to invoke the ‘forgotten’ men and women when it’s useful in a speech, but he didn’t give them a second thought when he passed enormous tax breaks for millionaires and corporations—and asked millions of American children, workers, and seniors to foot the bill. #SOTU
Instead of starting his presidency with a single bipartisan proposal, Trump made an all-out assault on Americans’ health care. #SOTU
The American people deserve a leader who spends less time patting his own back and more time having their backs. Unfortunately, what we’ve seen from Trump has been anything but real leadership. #SOTU
Just got back from #SOTU. Here are my thoughts: President Trump was eager to take credit for things he had nothing to do with and ignore the harm he has imposed on the country over the last year.
#AYearofTrump could have focused on real tax reform that helped the middle class. But he was hell-bent on giving unprecedented tax cuts to big corporations and the very wealthy—and is forcing working Americans to pay the price. #SOTU

As Pompeo said yesterday, Russia will interfere again in 2018 midterm elections. The United States cannot turn a blind eye. The bipartisan DETER Act sends a powerful message to Russia or any hostile actor: if you attack American elections, you will face severe consequences.

Mnuchin told the American people there would be “no absolute tax cut for the upper class” and Trump said "everybody" in the middle class would get a tax cut.

Here’s the thing: Our tax code should be simplified. But this bill isn’t really tax reform, it’s a giveaway to the wealthy and powerful.
6. When the debt eventually explodes, Republicans will rediscover their “deficit hawk” ways and cut Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security.
5. Uses the same trickle-down economics playbook that failed during the Bush Administration.
4. It repeals the state and local income tax deduction—double taxing hardworking Americans. 43% of Marylanders used this in 2015.
3. If you’re a couple with an estate over $11 million you just got a tax cut—leaving everyone else to pay the bill.
2. It’s a huge giveaway to big multinational corporations and millionaires + billionaires.
1. After years of lecturing about a looming debt crisis, Republicans are now happy adding $1.5 trillion to the national debt.

@KamalaHarris So now tell me, @SenateGOP: Who does this budget actually help? Because the facts are pretty clear to anyone who reads the bill.
@KamalaHarris The GOP budget cuts Medicaid by $1 trillion and Medicare by $473 billion to pay for (yup, you guessed it!) tax cuts for the wealthy.
@KamalaHarris The GOP budget repeals the state &amp; local income tax deduction. That would INCREASE taxes for millions of working people across the country.
@KamalaHarris The GOP budget eliminates the estate tax which helps only the top two-tenths of 1% of estates but adds $240B to our debt.
The GOP says their budget will help the middle-class, but they voted AGAINST an amendment I introduced with @KamalaHarris to guarantee that.
Republicans are quick to pay lip service when it comes to helping working families—but their budget does the exact opposite.

I was proud to join forces with advocacy organizations, lawyers, and local leaders to make sure the Acuña family stayed where they belonged.

@ICEgov Maryland was stronger with Diego &amp; Lizandro contributing to our society, &amp; my heart goes out to them &amp; their family at this difficult time.
@ICEgov Shame on President Trump for tearing apart hardworking immigrant families. We should be focused on MS-13, not scholarship winners.
@ICEgov I’m very upset to report that @ICEgov has moved forward with deporting Diego and Lizandro despite our community’s continued efforts.
The President is rooting for the exchanges to fail while doing everything possible to make that happen. Stop!
But POTUS continues to cynically tweet about sabotaging the ACA—generating uncertainty that leads to market crashes &amp; premiums increases!
To stabilize our exchanges, POTUS should:	Continue cost sharing reduction payments	Support enrollment efforts	Enforce the individual mandate
My office is working hard to make sure @ICEgov releases Diego and Lizandro. Help spread the word—this fight is too important.
But Diego and Lizandro should not be the victims of this Administration’s disturbing efforts to punish those who have done nothing wrong.
Our immigration system has been broken for too long, and we must work together to fix it.
It’s important to go after MS-13 gang members, but it is an insult to decency and common sense for Diego and Lizandro to be deported.
They’ve been exemplary Marylanders, prioritizing their educations and giving back to their community.

Do not be fooled. There are issues w/the ACA we CAN fix, but blowing it up is not the way.
#SkinnyRepeal will either be a Trojan horse for another bad plan or will pass the House and blow up our health care system.
McConnell &amp; Ryan would then present this WealthCare bill to Congress for final votes in September, with limited debate and NO amendments.
And even if we do go to a House-Senate conference—like McConnell wants—they would once again be protecting the wealthy behind closed doors.
In fact, McCarthy is telling members to stick around so they can act before August!
But don’t be fooled—House Republicans could pass this bad bill right away and it could go directly to the President’s desk.
In Maryland alone, the #SkinnyRepeal would leave 200,000+ uninsured w/an annual premium increase of $700+.
BUT #SkinnyRepeal is still rotten:	-Premiums will rise rapidly—20% next yr.	-Few or no affordable plans available	-16 million more uninsured
McConnell is pushing a “skinny repeal” and claiming he just wants to get a health care bill to a conference w/the House.

#CBOReport proves this is WealthCare, not health care. Keep up the fight: Call, text, email—we need your help to stop this monstrosity.
I’ll say it again: #Trumpcare is a massive transfer of wealth from middle-class and poor families to the richest Americans.
We must stop this unconscionable #HealthcareBill, @SenateGOP. What about putting the American people first? #CBOScore
#Trumpcare 3.0 is still very mean:	2018 → 15M uninsured	2020 → 19M uninsured	2026 → 22M uninsured		MILLIONS left w/o health care. #CBOScore
#Trumpcare slashes Medicaid and threatens access to care for those w/pre-existing conditions, women, seniors and most vulnerable. #CBOScore

@SenateGOP In total, the Senate spent 160+ hours considering the ACA and more than 160 Republican amendments were accepted during that process.
@SenateGOP In 2009, the Senate spent 25 days publicly debating the details of the ACA before it passed—the 2nd longest consecutive session in history.

Able Age Adjustment Act (S. 817) allows #PWDs with age of onset of disability up to age 46 to save with ABLE accounts. #InclusionWorks https://t.co/8GVkEN8dAN
@AutisticReality I will fight day and night to stop the Trump Administration's proposed budget plan to drastically cut ODEP and employment programs for #PWDs
It's important to note that funds in an ABLE account can be used for employment-related expense which would help the beneficiary get a job. https://t.co/3wHk6tmRhN
Proud to have worked with @SenatorBurr and @SenBobCasey to champion this bipartisan legislation: S. 816, 817, 818 #InclusionWorks https://t.co/j5HNxiSZLT
@amandabarrettvt The ABLE Age Adjustment Act would raise the age limit for ABLE accounts up to age 46. Currently, only individuals up to 26 are eligible.
@amandabarrettvt The ABLE Financial Planning Act would allow families to rollover savings in a 529 college savings plan into an ABLE account. #InclusionWorks
@amandabarrettvt The ABLE Work Act allows individuals and their families to save more money in an ABLE account if the beneficiary works and earns income.
The #ABLEAct 2.0 is a legislative package. It empowers those w/ disabilities &amp; gives them the opportunity for a better life. #InclusionWorks https://t.co/oVyaHkksgY

The rules do not need to change.		The nominee needs to change.		A seat on the Supreme Court should not be sold to the highest bidder.
Let’s make no mistake: Judge Gorsuch was never intended to be a mainstream nominee. It’s like he was picked by Bannon’s alt-right friends. 🤔 https://t.co/oz0t849j8R
A judge who thinks that the words “worker safety” are “ephemeral and generic” is not someone I trust to protect working families.
We’re not here to praise Gorsuch’s words, televised on campaign ads. We’re here to anticipate his actions and his record is clear:
Never before has this country witnessed a $10 million campaign for the SCOTUS. Dark money has flooded our airwaves with this nominee.

Trump is shamefully gutting transit investment. Does not understand how important job-creating infrastructure like the TIGER grant is?
This budget and Trumpcare prove Trump is helping his Wall St. friends over hardworking Americans w/ $590B in tax cuts to the wealthy.
It gives polluters free rein. It ends the cleanup of the Chesapeake, endangering this vital habitat and the livelihood of Marylanders.
How can Trump provide health insurance for "everybody" when Trumpcare cuts Medicaid by $880 billion? This is not who we are.
A Nation cannot achieve greatness on military might alone, while cutting everything else that we as Americans value.
Trump's budget will hurt hard-working families and deny millions of Americans the opportunity to get the help they need to get ahead.

Trumpcare:		2018 → 14 million uninsured	2020 → 21 million uninsured	2026 → 24 million uninsured
.@realDonaldTrump just look at the "terrible mess" you inherited! #ThanksObama #JobsReport https://t.co/ozuZDzWNuE
Maybe you can answer my question, @SpeakerRyan: Why does Trumpcare cut Medicaid by $370 billion, even though @POTUS promised to protect it? https://t.co/sByCGi0gNS
#Trumpcare betrays the voters @realDonaldTrump courted during the campaign -- it helps the rich get richer at the expense of everyone else. https://t.co/nxzsolrLi4
It's clear that President Trump negotiated #Trumpcare on behalf of the millionaires &amp; billionaires in his cabinet - not everyday Americans. https://t.co/FkKsS189Fz
Speaker Ryan &amp; Sec. Price know it's wrong to attack credibility of nonpartisan @USCBO. W/ @PressSec piling on criticism, they must speak up https://t.co/sIpAvi2Hyi
#Trumpcare would strip care from millions of Americans, raise premiums, cut taxes for the rich - AND create a huge new tax break for CEOs.
No wonder Republicans kept #Trumpcare details a secret for weeks - it's a disaster for everyone but the wealthy.
If you believe #Trumpcare is wonderful, I’ve got some Trump Steaks to sell you. https://t.co/QP2OsYhe9K
False equivalence at its most cynical. iPhones aren't a threat to health care access - but #Trumpcare certainly is. https://t.co/WEZPCdRxcb

Rep. Price has been devoted to policies that go against the fundamental mission of @HHSGov. I urge my colleagues to oppose his nomination.
In budget after budget, Rep. Price proposed dismantling programs that keep millions out of poverty -- while giving tax breaks to the top 1%.
Rep. Price authored original 'Repeal and Run' healthcare plan. It would have destroyed the private market -- a health &amp; economic disaster.
The #ACA protects millions of Marylanders, regardless of whether they're covered by their employer, individual market, Medicare, or Medicaid
.@realDonaldTrump repeatedly committed to a health care system that covers all Americans, yet Rep. Price has worked against that goal.

My sleeves are rolled up and I'm ready for the challenges ahead. Together, let's get to work.
We must call out hate wherever we see it. We cannot forget that America's story is rooted in the fight for equality for all people.
I commit to working every day for the America I love: a decent nation, a beacon of hope, a defender of liberty and justice.
As I prepare for the honor and duty of serving all of Maryland, my resolve to fight for the character of our nation has never been stronger.
Divided we fall, divided we fail. We must stand firmly together to overcome our many pressing challenges.
Divided, we cannot protect our society's most vulnerable. Divided, we hand those stoking fear for political gain the ugly power they seek.
We cannot allow ourselves to be torn apart by hate. Divided, we cannot defend the progress we've made as a nation.
From racist and anti-Semitic graffiti in Md. to attacks on Muslim women in Cali., the effect of Trump's campaign rhetoric is in full view.
The America I believe in is a land of decency, respect, and liberty. These ideals have been challenged in recent days.
