Pain patients are more watched and tracked and stigmatized than child predators. This is ludicrous and needs to end.
Medicine isn‚Äôt a one size, one type fits all. People shouldn‚Äôt have to suffer after surgery because they may have a few pills more than they actually needed when their recovery is finished. Push leftover turn-ins not deal with severe pain because someone else‚Äôs actions
Suboxone is not for pain it‚Äôs for substance use disorder. Our addiction rate is the same today as it was 100 years ago. Dependence and addiction are not the same thing quit stigmatizing legitimate pain patients who need medication to have quality of life....
Did nothing but help the cartel push deadly fake pills around the country which are killing by the 1000‚Äôs. 98% of people do not abuse drugs and we are all happy that those who do can get help. But all pain patients branded as addicts and hurded then to suboxone which he profits
The reason deaths have skyrocketed is because the legal supply chain of legitimate drugs was cut so drastically people who never used drugs before aside from prescribed turned to street pills and other drugs for pain because they could no longer get treated. Cutting the supply...
Why would he get an award? All he did was pour gasoline on the problem. Since he got involved deaths have skyrocketed from overdoses and suicides. Never treated a single pain patient has no clue what he‚Äôs doing won‚Äôt acknowledge the impact of his actions https://t.co/1gITNEZfhd

@LilyCrue It‚Äôs very cheap even if you do have to pay for it well far as testing goes I think it was like 60 bucks
@LilyCrue Yep they pay for everything Medicaid isn‚Äôt bad in that area. The worst thing is the preauthorization paperwork but that all gets cleared pretty fast not that I know who to poke
@LilyCrue Yeah I had one of those pharmacogenomic testing panels done on me I process morphing 5xs faster than I should almost any dose is lethal. And methadone was a do not take under any circumstances ever I do not process it at all may as well give me rat poison
@LilyCrue I like 50/50 thc cbd topicals those seems to help as much as my lidocaine patches of not more but as I only get 197 a month to live on while waiting for disability it‚Äôs generally out of my price range.
@LilyCrue Yeah well I‚Äôm a 260lb guy with several years of high dose tolerance.
@LilyCrue Man it was really good as an extended release I almost never felt full on touch pain I can wear a slipper as long as it doesn‚Äôt have multiple textures on the inside or touch my heel. We shall see how these go but last time I had IR pills I was in pain often.
@LilyCrue Right and for all those opiate zealot basterds our there I want to point out that‚Äôs 120mme per day and I don‚Äôt even catch the slightest bit of a ‚Äúhigh‚Äù just makes it so I can get through my day without screaming...
@LilyCrue Still a little apprehensive about switching me back to instant release meds over the time released because the er pills seemed to keep me more even keel as far as my daily pain levels.
@LilyCrue https://t.co/Mf4GepV84T
@LilyCrue Just picked them up /win. So much stress and worry over a simple conversation about a missing chart note.
Finally after going over everything I went into their office and just explained it they ended up saying their bad we forgot to note that we had you change the regiment but I remember that conversation come think about it. We will call your pharmacy and get your meds today
@LilyCrue Yeah I would t either if I wouldn‚Äôt be 100% homeless if I didn‚Äôt
@LilyCrue I can drive for 2 hours max then I need 8-10 hours of rest before I can go further.

@DanLairdMD @ThomasKlineMD @Pharmaciststeve
Now because I followed verbal instructions on how to finish my previous fill and they scheduled an appointment for me to come in a couple days before I would run out in the verbal instructions they gave me an i in the wrong here? I did what I was told not written @DanLairdMD
I wouldn‚Äôt worry about it if I knew this office but this is like 2 visits in. Just a bumpy transfer from doctors.
From there verbal instruction where they wrote new script (but placed a hold for after I‚Äôm out for 4-5 days). What do I do? I feel if I say I took them not as labeled as they told me to I‚Äôm going to get flagged but if I don‚Äôt say anything I‚Äôm going to have to experience full crps
Now they decided to change my meds and keep my original fill date assuming no increase. Now they didn‚Äôt write verbal instructions on a pharmacy pad because I had just gotten a fill of same meds with a different regiment scheduled an appointment for a couple days before I was out
The dilemma:  so 2 weeks ago I went into this pms office and they gave me verbal instructions I followed those verbal instructions and informed my primary care about these instructions (increase by 1 pill a day stop taking other med) primary care oks it as well theywrotewhatihave
@SparlingAngela Lol scroll down my tweets I posted the denial and my response it really was ridiculous.
@brent_kellogg Yeah he denied it because they didn‚Äôt look at my medical file apparently just decided I could drive a little so I‚Äôm good. So now it‚Äôs at some office in falls church Virginia. Sent me a letter couple weeks ago saying I had 30 days to send any additional medical info.
@nonni28 Yeah I just went into the new pm office and said umm... this isn‚Äôt what we discussed which is fine I‚Äôll try something else but y‚Äôall are waiting till the day after I run out to fill my meds so I gotta wake up med free and get to the pharmacy. Which is bs.

@ToiletBowlSpiri @imjustasteph @SRWells3 @WolfeLing @IlhanMN You going to say less than 25% of muslims take their religion seriously?  I‚Äôm sure if polled on Christianity it would be higher per capita. I know our soldiers kneel and pray to god before every mission. May not always be the same god I‚Äôm sure theres Muslim fighters on this side
@ToiletBowlSpiri @imjustasteph @SRWells3 @WolfeLing @IlhanMN Although same can be said of every religious group. Christians feel everyone should be Christian or some variation.  Been lots of wars fought over religious ideation. Read history.

@AudreyL44703843 Way too poor for all that although I think I qualify for an in home nurse a few hours a week seriously considering that option to help pull my slack.
@imjustasteph @SRWells3 @WolfeLing @IlhanMN So no it‚Äôs not ok.
@imjustasteph @SRWells3 @WolfeLing @IlhanMN But it‚Äôs 2 1/2% of 1.8 billion people. With that said it is estimated that there are 300-400k potential fighters for ISIS. However the 22 1/2 % left believe they can indoctrinate the rest of the world it is their view to climb to power positions and impose sharia law.....
@imjustasteph @SRWells3 @WolfeLing @IlhanMN Actually the phrase translated means god is greater. It is associated with extremist views despite its common usage.

@ravensspirit68 @SheepHeadLori @PattyMurray Unless you own like Walmart and send millions of lobby money their way they‚Äôll never listen. George Carlin said it right. Me and you just ain‚Äôt part of the club.
@LilyCrue Sometimes I just feel like she feels she‚Äôs in pain and that that‚Äôs the same thing and it is. Pain is pain. I dunno it‚Äôs just hard having expectations and feeling pushed all the time to do so much.
@LilyCrue I cook on bad days too I don‚Äôt have a choice essentially because they feel it‚Äôs so easy for me and it‚Äôs just not anymore.
@LilyCrue And I thought I understood pain but there is nothing like crps and it‚Äôs hard not to be dismissive of her pain because it‚Äôs not that which is kind of wrong of me as well.
@LilyCrue Like is this week I haven‚Äôt gotten out of bed except to go to the hospital and that translates through my relationships with people. I live with another pain patient she has degenerative disc disease her own set of issues and it‚Äôs hard not to be like üëÄ I know you get pain
@LilyCrue For me and I end up in fights with my significant other because I don‚Äôt want to try new recipients out because they are too much work or overly complicated/time consuming which puts me in a bad position.Hurt myself or be a dick.just one example of hundreds that come up regularly
@LilyCrue Well. I cook. Kind of. I was a chef once and what I can do in 15 minutes is chopped worthy. But sometimes it‚Äôs too much and if I don‚Äôt cook it‚Äôs pizza or some other kind of takeout.  Everyone has health issues so now there is like special diets they want to try but it‚Äôs so much
Question of the day: How do you deal with the demands of significant others and family members when they are pushing you past your limits?  I find I often have to put my foot down and say no because it‚Äôs causing me so much pain and then feel I have no choice but to do it anyway

@LilyCrue @DeniseGeltman @Talkeetna101 Honestly I don‚Äôt think anything‚Äôs going to make a difference at this point my bones have progressed far into metabolizing themselves in all 4 limbs and a few ribs
@LilyCrue @DeniseGeltman @Talkeetna101 However it‚Äôs all in how often I can get approved for a shot if I can get one every two weeks forever then great if it‚Äôs like every 6 weeks I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôll bother
@LilyCrue @DeniseGeltman @Talkeetna101 So ild say the first series made things worse after they stopped however I think the damage is done so I‚Äôm gunna continue to do them because I do get relief while their active.
@LilyCrue @DeniseGeltman @Talkeetna101 The switch keeps me from ever developing a tolerance to it like you know you can get used to some parts of the pain as long as they are constant but if it‚Äôs changing back and forth all the time it‚Äôs incredibly hard to get comfortable.
@LilyCrue @DeniseGeltman @Talkeetna101 The place I was going to was really far away so it cost a bundle in gas and parking in downtown Seattle plus half the day. New place is much closer and said they‚Äôll be quick like an hour over 3-4 per trip. Also I went from a constantly hot crps to an alternating hot/cold ...
@LilyCrue @DeniseGeltman @Talkeetna101 I had a series of 4 biphosphate and lidocaine injections  they worked fantastic for about a week and a half per shot it was black and white different the downside..well couple downsides...Set off spasms in my stomach which make me feel like I‚Äôm being kicked in the nuts frequently
@LilyCrue @DeniseGeltman @Talkeetna101 I could wear shoes while I was getting back injections which are going to start again soon but it‚Äôs like a week per shot the rest of the time any kind of friction is aweful
@jenrauls Both feet and severe touch pain and burning/stinging on top of what feels like someone hitting me with a sledge hammer randomly.
Anyone got a decent shoe option for crps?  Snow drifts are large and going to be like that awhile not getting by with my floppy‚Äôs anymore need something covering but not restrictive as the touchpain is unbearable even with medication.

@TheFuglyFrog @RobertDRoseJr1 I can see that but I have a maximum of 2 hours a day ability to drive before the pain is overwhelming and I need to medicate and sleep it off. Really two hours a day of an unreclined position that includes drive time to and from whatever job I might find. How is that gainful
@TheFuglyFrog @RobertDRoseJr1 Persnickety üòÇ. Yeah I dunno bunch of ball washing basterds if you ask me. Paid to deny people help and take 90 days a year paid vacation for it
@TheFuglyFrog @RobertDRoseJr1 @RobertDRoseJr1 and if they haven‚Äôt where do I send it now?
@TheFuglyFrog @RobertDRoseJr1 Oh hey Robert I never got a notification or anything that they got that can you confirm that it was submitted to your case?
@TheFuglyFrog @RobertDRoseJr1 Yeah well I gotta explain what I do during the day that‚Äôs it that‚Äôs how I have a place to live and that‚Äôs what my very minimal daily activity consist of. Apparently I‚Äôm too honest.

@Wanita1 This is the body‚Äôs way of creating new dopamine output to try and balance the lack it had previously.
@Wanita1 Heroin addicts also feel intense pain while coming off of drugs because their body is firing its sympathetic nervous system in response to a lack of dopamine in the brain as they have over supplemented and quit producing it all together.
@Wanita1 It‚Äôs because it isn‚Äôt true. This theory is based on rebound pain. As meds wear off completely it can be like suffering the acute pain all over again feeling it for the first time as your brain has not been releasing enough natural dopamine to level off the pain. It‚Äôs transient.

@BrandiW16839800 Methadone can be very beneficial for pain. Downside is coming off is hard.
@Katamac1967 Of the estimated 25million pain patients that means 15000 addicts roughly in that population.  But according to this report there is 2million people addicted. 67% of 2m is 1.34m that‚Äôs a seriously conflicted number from the actual evidence. Want to give that another go?
@Katamac1967 Now that‚Äôs a long way from 80 prescriptions per 100 people. Let‚Äôs talk about injectables next. 62% of addicts are not chronic pain patients. The chronic pain patient only has around a .06% addiction rate according to dozens of studies done by government agencies.
@Katamac1967 Cdc/fda topped opiate prescriptions at 100m/y considering no refills available citnthat number by like 1/2 to account for second refills from surgery and chronic pain patients. Now like 50m prescriptions really.  Cut that again in half for single prescriptions for procedures.

@MsOsabear @GodivaMahoney @ChronicallyKoa I didn‚Äôt see that comment or I woulda jumped on him as an idiot. I got comments to @reversechapter and his points were valid. Hard edits are draconian and dangerous which is what the article is talking about. Hard edits
@MsOsabear @GodivaMahoney @ChronicallyKoa Just has to work. However opiates work on both major issues I‚Äôm having so I guess I do have a want to not take 30 pills a day and only 2-3 instead as that‚Äôs WAY better for my overall health and my poor stomach/liver/kidneys etc
@MsOsabear @GodivaMahoney @ChronicallyKoa Well I don‚Äôt agree with that statement either. Fuck wants. I want a million dollars (so I can afford to try ketamine treatment..Jesus expensive) but ain‚Äôt no one giving it to me. I need pain control or I‚Äôll jump off something tall period. It‚Äôs a need. Doesn‚Äôt need to be an opiate
@MsOsabear @GodivaMahoney @ChronicallyKoa I don‚Äôt think you said no pills ever. You agreed with hard edits. Which is dangerous and negligent care
@MsOsabear @GodivaMahoney @ChronicallyKoa No ones advocating to give anything to anyone based on ‚Äúwant‚Äù we are saying common sense trained doctor discretion based on clinical observations that can only be received in person. Not blanket laws and hard edits
@MsOsabear @GodivaMahoney @ChronicallyKoa Now I‚Äôm not condoning that behavior in any way don‚Äôt get me wrong. I hope you dispose of your leftover medication properly. But seriously there needs to be a better common sense thought process to this and. It just the knee jerk reaction to not let anyone have them
@MsOsabear @GodivaMahoney @ChronicallyKoa Your right you can not control someone‚Äôs personal responsibility but that doesn‚Äôt mean you should enforce draconian 1 size fits all law to medicine the likelihood that you are doing more harm than good far outweighs the risk of diversion of a few generally low dose pills
@MsOsabear @GodivaMahoney @ChronicallyKoa Of course not! You didn‚Äôt need them most people are that way. So giving most people more than they need necessarily isn‚Äôt a big issue. As addiction only occurs in 2% of the population as a whole the likelyhood that you are doing someone harm is lower than killing you in surgery
@MsOsabear @GodivaMahoney @ChronicallyKoa Sure theft can happen. My door could get kicked in and I could get robbed at gun point as well. You can‚Äôt control other people‚Äôs actions. Got more than you needed? Every pharmacy has a medication disposal box you can drop extras in. You got more than you needed did you take them?
@MsOsabear @GodivaMahoney @ChronicallyKoa Was that before or after 2012? Far as I know it requires a police report to replace a prescription. And even then the pharmacy won‚Äôt fill it because of current prescribing practices and the pdmp. Those ways of playing the system are gone. The pill mills are gone as well.
@MsOsabear @GodivaMahoney @ChronicallyKoa Don‚Äôt sacrifice my life for theirs and that‚Äôs what hard edits do. I‚Äôm a severe crps patient. My bones are eating themselves so I have severe osteopathic pain as well.  What if I have a surgery on one of those limbs? Think 3 days or even 2 weeks is going to be enough for recovery?
@MsOsabear @GodivaMahoney @ChronicallyKoa No one denying that there are ways to play the system. But that doesn‚Äôt cover the majority. Always a few bad apples in the bunch but that doesn‚Äôt mean we should stop eating apples.  Yes there‚Äôs abusers out there help us being made available to them. But...
@MsOsabear @GodivaMahoney @ChronicallyKoa That‚Äôs not condoned by any doctor I‚Äôve ever met. We have to sign contracts insurance won‚Äôt fill out meds till day 30 not even day 28 like the rest of our meds. If you go in after being given a 30d script 7 days later you‚Äôre going to get flagged and put into addiction treatment.
@MsOsabear @GodivaMahoney @ChronicallyKoa What about after you have exhausted all efforts to seek treatment?  The house is gone living in your car or on the street because you can‚Äôt return to work. We‚Äôre talking pain patients. Making it worse because their situation. At that point what‚Äôs there to loose other than pain?
@MsOsabear @GodivaMahoney @ChronicallyKoa Common sense prescribing not hard limits. Oregon is pushing for hard limits.
@MsOsabear @GodivaMahoney @ChronicallyKoa The overdose and suicide rate. There is clear evidence through scientific study that capping dosage is pointless. There is clear evidence that limiting pain medication causes harm #endthestigma #DontPunishPain
@MsOsabear @GodivaMahoney @ChronicallyKoa Since 1 dose to the next can be wildly different dosage in the same amount of substance people quickly die. Want to fix the #Opioid problem? End the draconian laws and start giving compassionate care. There is a lot of mounting evidence that refusing medication is driving up ...
@MsOsabear @GodivaMahoney @ChronicallyKoa It also makes them more dangerous. This major crack down is forcing legitimate patients to seek any kind of relief they can get and since there is triple the supply of these illicit substances available and not their legitimate meds they use drugs that are not reliably potent...
@MsOsabear @GodivaMahoney @ChronicallyKoa Their stats are 5 people a week die of an opiate in Oregon. Want to know why that is? When we legalized pot the cartel quit sending it they instead tripled the heroin/ cocaine/ meth that‚Äôs coming instead.  These drugs all get cut with fentanyl because it makes them more addicting
@MsOsabear @GodivaMahoney @ChronicallyKoa No pain meds won‚Äôt help fix that just make you comfortable since you needed more treatment. That‚Äôs not generally the case for most post op patients. But saying 3 days as a hard cap after any surgery is ludicrous and a dangerous overstep that‚Äôs going to cause needless suffering.

@MsOsabear @GodivaMahoney @ChronicallyKoa That‚Äôs great that that worked for you but medicine isn‚Äôt a 1 size fits all and not all people can afford to go see a holistic md and get adjustments.  While I agree there should be a common sense starting line a week or two after surgery. It shouldn‚Äôt be a hard edit. Ppl are diff
@MsOsabear @GodivaMahoney @ChronicallyKoa Now let‚Äôs go a little further... what if you require several surgeries over months of a time span to correct something like a spinal injury 3 days per surgery? Not realistic. Now what if your surgery is botched and you don‚Äôt heal from it? What if you got crps from it. This is bad
@MsOsabear @GodivaMahoney @ChronicallyKoa Well... that could depend was it infected how much impact on the other teeth. Lots of factors play into pain. Post op.. ever had an orthopedic surgery? Average need for pain meds after a broken leg that requires surgery  is 2-4 weeks. What about a bone extraction and fusion?

@MissPaulaKelly @Iamchronicpain Yeah I‚Äôm sure they will it‚Äôs not an unreasonable request for someone in my position.

@MissPaulaKelly @Iamchronicpain Depression for about an hour cause I‚Äôm loosing my mind with the transition from 1 limb to 4 then we talked about everything else and she talked about some conference she‚Äôs going to bring it to as her clinical unicorn.

@MissPaulaKelly @Iamchronicpain Primary care doctor only person who was willing to take care of me after being passed around for 8 months she said ‚Äú fuck this is ridiculous‚Äù and started prescribing me for pain.

@MissPaulaKelly @Iamchronicpain I‚Äôve really only had opiates again for a few months and yes I‚Äôve tried the gambit of things. I asked for them to come up with a longer lasting solution than three 4 hour pills
@MissPaulaKelly @Iamchronicpain The only reason they are interested is because my bones are eating themselves because of the crps. But hey interest is good
@MissPaulaKelly @Iamchronicpain Although it was good atleast my case has peaked interest and maybe it‚Äôll get better for me. There were several suggestions I‚Äôm open to but mostly just don‚Äôt have the money for. I‚Äôve been through the gambit of all the ‚Äúnew meds‚Äù bad reactions to most. Maybe ketamine pills next?
@MissPaulaKelly @Iamchronicpain I agree.

@heatherzamm @CDCInjury They know that the tightening of prescriptions made legitimate pain patients go to the streets. Those substances kill more reliably than pain meds since the average od has an average of 6 drugs in their system not just the opiate. But that helps cut Medicaid/Medicare‚Äôs budget
@heatherzamm @CDCInjury That‚Äôs not really that interesting either. Everything they have shows direct correlation to the rise in suicides to the tapering of pain meds.  They just say those people were addicts and move on. Everyone committing suicide has substance abuse problems not pain what‚Äôs that?!?
@heatherzamm @CDCInjury It‚Äôs not that they don‚Äôt know it‚Äôs that they don‚Äôt care. Pile of money for the cdc to release guidelines that ‚Äúfix‚Äù the problem knowing full well the data is flawed badly it‚Äôs easy to show improvement on paper.  It‚Äôs all a scam
@heatherzamm @cynthiabydesign @hyennie @CDCInjury @DrMarcSiegel Euphoria doesn‚Äôt generally happen to pain patients. Maybe that first prescription after a surgery that first week or two but after that if you are euphoric you are on too high a dose. Proper prescribing doesn‚Äôt get people ‚Äústoned‚Äù generally.
@heatherzamm @CDCInjury Speechless isn‚Äôt the word I‚Äôm outright üò° . There is direct correlation that the suicide rate is being driven up steadily as prescribing rates are going down.

@DanLairdMD D. It‚Äôs her choice the doctors chose to believe she would be in pain after a severe surgery (which I‚Äôm positive she was for at least a few days) but at the end of the day it was her choice and the doctors gave it to her once leaving their care in the form of discretion to fill.
@DanLairdMD C. If she does not want post op medication even though it was written she still has a choice to get OTC medication instead of filling the slightly stronger ment to help her sleep better post op Tylenol3 (which is OTC in other countries because it is generally a very safe med).

@LilyCrue @ravensspirit68 I would add I‚Äôve never had it myself prohibitively expensive.  But I read good things
@LilyCrue @ravensspirit68 The studies I found had no mention of how long the patients had crps but yes high dose infusion is the recommended treatment as the body breaks it down to other things when ingested.
@LilyCrue @ravensspirit68 There‚Äôs the plastic side not the soft side.  And you would require pain management to even begin desensitizeing if you have crps. Basic touch is excruciating
@LilyCrue @ravensspirit68 It‚Äôs causation is the difference the result is the same. Type 1 starts in the brain type 2 starts in a nerve cluster. Only real difference
Taper to off at all cost. And you must now pay for your only source of medication (cbd oil) out of pocket. Forcing patients to costly alternatives is not right. What the fuck do they have insurance for then? https://t.co/0yqWItyyYe

@LilyCrue @ravensspirit68 That‚Äôs type 1 where air and water hurt. Type 2 is different.  Sound hurts because the vibration touch sensation is wrong this happens when a damaged nerve tries to grow back and mixes up the receptors. More damage pain than neuropathic pain.
@ravensspirit68 You‚Äôll also start to notice a color change in your hand over time. It‚Äôs like my mood ring. If it‚Äôs a deep purple or red leave me alone! My hands are never the same color anymore.
@ravensspirit68 Not unusual I burned myself to the bone without realizing it didn‚Äôt feel a thing out of the ordinary. Always feels like that so my body didn‚Äôt respond.
@ravensspirit68 Go to a different medical system. There is doctors who can and will treat crps but most don‚Äôt know what to do with you. Bring your own research papers to appointments. I find that handing them medical research papers helps them make appropriate decisions.
@ravensspirit68 It‚Äôs like 5 sensations at once it‚Äôs electrical, burning, pressure, sharp, pinching.
@ravensspirit68 That gets better. It‚Äôll just be certain spots that are horrific.  The desensitization therapy helps but you‚Äôll need to be heavily medicated to get through it. No way without medication. Ketamine seems to be the most effective for it but it‚Äôs not covered so opiates is only hope.
@ravensspirit68 R u having spasticity? Feels like pressure in your wrist but if you feel down your arm it‚Äôll feel like there‚Äôs 1 cluster you could strum.
@ravensspirit68 From the photo it looks like they put a stitch through your ulnar nerve cluster located under this little scar on my wrist https://t.co/3aU7SrSue6
@ravensspirit68 Looks like they clipped your ulnar nerve so the pain would go up to your elbow. If The muscle starts to cord you‚Äôll need a antispasmodic medication. That‚Äôll bring you some relief.
@ravensspirit68 @LilyCrue Also  nortryptalyn helps with the burning for me I‚Äôve also found that the plastic side of Velcro will relieve some of the burning. Giving it a different real ‚Äúpain stimulation‚Äù Velcro not being actually painful but helps fire those receptors in a healthy way.
@ravensspirit68 @LilyCrue Mirror therapy and ketamine work best. But opiates are more likely a viable option for getting through therapy.
@ravensspirit68 The electrical shock is the indicator of type 2. In my hand it feels like a wire brush being rubbed into my knuckle then being plugged into an outlet
@ravensspirit68 Sounds like type 2 crps. Yes it‚Äôs nerve damage
@MarkAlanFlecke3 @OptumRx @SenateHELP I have complicated condition that even pain management doctors tell me is over their heads and refer me elsewhere. Now it‚Äôs just an insurance headache that never ends. Thanks @OptumRx
@MarkAlanFlecke3 @OptumRx @SenateHELP I haven‚Äôt been able to return to work for years because of everything. And it‚Äôs just a pure lack of money at my disposal standing between me and being able to get and keep a job which would pay for it.  Was a long hard road to find a doctor who would treat me
@MarkAlanFlecke3 @OptumRx @SenateHELP Less than 400 bucks a month stands between me and being able to resume a fairly normal life in-spite of my serious condition.  Kinda sad really
@MarkAlanFlecke3 @OptumRx @SenateHELP I know it is a very easy avenue. I‚Äôve had close friends go that way. But if I turn to it it‚Äôll be a means for suicide rather than relief. I can‚Äôt afford to self medicate even if I wanted to. If I could afford that I would just buy the legal prescription that‚Äôs not getting filled.

@ciaagofficial Now I‚Äôm not saying the Patch Adams approach doesn‚Äôt work at all but it doesn‚Äôt suit the majority needs of patients. Quit focusing on the minority. Yes addiction is real yes we should be able to identify those people in need of help and get them help but to deny the rest of us...
@StephSlit @heatherzamm It does affect them they just don‚Äôt realize it yet.  The bills being passed are restricting post op meds er meds pain management meds. All in the name of switching to higher priced meds you need more often. Who pays the fda? Pharma companies!  What‚Äôs good for business? ......
But hey why would medical professionals know what‚Äôs better for me than a board of pharmacist. They also mentioned that the very low mme was not appropriate outside of cancer patients. SMH. Type2 crps crumbling fusion caused by severe spasticity below it. But no med appropriate?
Ok well seems help was not exactly what I got I got an appeasement to save face but I got the official letter from Medicaid saying 45 days to review and they will have a decision as to whether I meet the requirements to receive my medication.  Hmmm..3 doctors already decided that
@bonniez45 @ciaagofficial Muscle or a pinched nerve where the solution put space in the joint allowing the nerve to reposition itself. Muscle point injections are valid treatment and kind of nice to get that instead of being shuffled around.
@Jwjacobs817Jeff @ciaagofficial Not just ignorant but dangerous to the patients. While we may not die today to deny pain treatment is a death sentence for so many. Our death row is a slow torture chamber in our bedrooms where we suffer alone withdrawn from family and friends cut off because are not able w/o
@ciaagofficial And if you are stupid enough to believe that you probably also believe that vaping is a gateway drug to meth addiction.
@ciaagofficial Pain is real. Please remember what compassionate care is. Yes there is addicts. No ones becoming one from a@short prescription from the er
@ciaagofficial But to refuse treatment is another thing altogether what happens when it‚Äôs not a simple muscle point injection to relieve a pinched nerve. Lidocaine for kidney stones?  Who decided that was a good idea.... clearly someone who has never had a stone.
@ciaagofficial What in the actual fuck.... who walks into the er and request the harpist for pain. The only point this story made that was real was the case of the former practitioner who hurt his back was denied medication and turned to street drugs.  Muscle point injections. Treatment is good

@VanceHuxley And sound can be fun also. Too much bass going by in the car next to me can make me scream out from@the air vibrating
@VanceHuxley Oh I dunno I have a lot of skin changes my hands aren‚Äôt even the same color. It‚Äôs visible to the naked eye
@VanceHuxley Didn‚Äôt get a dime but posting it and putting it out there made a difference
@VanceHuxley Cbn the canniboid associated with sleep seems to also ease the burning however the isotope is still very expensive and no one test their products for it.  I wrote a small guide for helping people find the right stuff though. https://t.co/hvtQPPVdxc hope that‚Äôs useful to someone
@VanceHuxley Things that help I have found other than medicine are kind of odd    Velcro the plastic part. Seems to ease the burning a little of I rub it I actually slept in a glove made of it for awhile. My doc gave me lidocaine patches for sleeping which give me a little more tolerance
@VanceHuxley Can burn* can‚Äôt feel it at all just feels normal.
@VanceHuxley I also get the added benefits of intolerance to soft things. My pillow feels like being hit with a brick at night a feather feels like a razor blade and I can‚Äôt burn myself to the bone and not even realize I hurt myself.
@VanceHuxley I‚Äôve been diganosed by dozens of separate clinicians the problem with causalgia vs type 1 is that the nerve grew back but all the sensations are flipped. I have all the typical symptoms shiny skin rigid nails burning but...
@VanceHuxley But no we aren‚Äôt protected with crps many people across the country have crps and are not being treated or are under-treated being abandoned.
@VanceHuxley And I atleast know enough about what‚Äôs going on with me to find the people@I need but it takes a LONG time
@VanceHuxley My biggest issues is I‚Äôve been denied disability 4 times already so not having Medicare that follows you getting setup on Medicaid every time we move takes upwards of a year to get reestablished.  Most doctors have never seen causalgia or have the slightest idea what to do for it

@cam_lavalle @GhostinGeek @WhiteHouse I actually feel bad for her I‚Äôm constantly poking her inbox. Mostly cause the anxiety this all causes. The run around and time it takes to get reestablished somewhere and not being taken care of in the mean time. Visits to the er for quick referrals and specialist. Long waits.

@zartman66 @djwilliams35 @DanLairdMD I completely agree. Self@medication out of desperation is certainly on the rise. Look at the death toll from these illicit drugs.
@zartman66 @djwilliams35 @DanLairdMD Yes and no. We need those poppy‚Äôs not all medicines are completely synthetic. We guard them because big companies pay for their protection.
@zartman66 @djwilliams35 @DanLairdMD So... while we are at war in those countries producing the heroin we aren‚Äôt going to do a thing to China as they hold our debt. Let‚Äôs be real. So let‚Äôs punish doctors and patients so we can be tough on this epidemic but in reality nothing the government isgoing to do will stop it
@zartman66 @djwilliams35 @DanLairdMD It‚Äôs now being mixed in with readily available heroin and other illicit drugs making them more addictive and dangerous
@zartman66 @djwilliams35 @DanLairdMD This gives it varying levels of potency because the delivery method and chemistry has been changed. This got here through the mail marker as ‚Äúmedical research‚Äù  chemicals  bought through torrents and crypto networks
@zartman66 @djwilliams35 @DanLairdMD The problem really has any heroin however. It is seriously potent fentanyl analogous that‚Äôs killing most people. This isn‚Äôt fentanyl you‚Äôll get from your doctor this is something else. It‚Äôs been altered by Chinese chemist to be nearly identical with a slightly different makeup
@zartman66 @djwilliams35 @DanLairdMD Well we are at war in the country producing it that would be Afghanistan. However our troops protect the poppy‚Äôs not destroy them.

The next glass comes as more of a pole with buckets on each end chained to your neck. This will drag you down even further ( complications from untreated pain such as congestive heart failure, depression, suicidal idealization) at this point it‚Äôs no longer a bearable burden.
Without our medications and management our glass will remain full and become heavier and heavier as time goes by. As the glass get too heavy told hold any longer we break down and loose hope. When we loose hope it‚Äôs like adding another glass. This one heavier still.
https://t.co/G6QUHFn5lK.  Here is the problem with mindfulness and being a #cpp. As hard as we try we may never be able set the glass down on our own. We need real intervention to empty the glass and ease our burden however our burden will always be held.
@WriterMera And the #cpp community as well causing people to develop higher tolerances etc. but now that the lawsuits are being fired against Purdue and other major drug manufacturers for this the insurance companies are taking a standardized approach and just cutting people off.
@WriterMera This has caused a complete break down of the medical care system in regards to chronic pain amongst other things. Yes Purdue was wrong in their advertising and telling doctors to just increase the dose yes that caused serious issues in the addict community.
@WriterMera The problem in a nut shell. https://t.co/74QWJat6Xk the people have become insignificant bystanders of the deep seeded corruption in politics and in the insurance companies. They bought the reporting companies that feed the cdc information and paid politicians to lean their way.

@nonni28 @DCap529 @VanceHuxley It‚Äôs the canniboid that is associated with sleep. It is found in high thc indica plants that have not finished processing all of the cbg into thc/cbd your looking for either the isotope which can be prohibitively expensive or an indica plant with roughly 20-25% thc and 1-1.5% cbd

@VanceHuxley The meds I‚Äôm on we‚Äôre picked from a research paper my PCP and I found when looking for something to hold me over till I could get into pain management
@VanceHuxley I am I have several appointments with other pain clinics scheduled I knew it was going to be a process to find the right doctor for me. But this guy was telling me there‚Äôs no research to support continuing my medication which is when I got up and walked out
I recorded this visit I plan on putting out a full dictation in next few days. This was absolutely insane I tell ya I have never felt so close to suicide than after he planted that seed. I wonder how many people have left this guys office and eaten a bullet immediately.
It‚Äôs their job to teach me how to live my life through the pain not to manage the pain.   YOU REALLY SAID THAT?  Why in the fuck did you choose to be a pain management doctor if you do not believe in treating pain.
When asked about my condition and experience with it he went on to tell me there are two types of pain patients he sees. People dying of cancer and everyone else and it‚Äôs all about my perception of pain that it doesn‚Äôt matter I hurt it matters how I react to it
My whole appointment was a complete psycho analyst and not a damn question asked had anything to do with having a bad outcome from surgery and developing type2 crps.   When asked questions they were deflected in a sales pitch like manner.  ‚Äú that‚Äôs a good question but ....
Got into pain management early.  ‚ÄúWe do not prescribe medications here. We teach you to live with the pain so your tombstone doesn‚Äôt read died  at 36 but lived to 86‚Äù.  In other word get busy living or dying. Hell of a suicide seed you‚Äôre planting doc.  Wtf

@holly_sruart So if any of you doctors happen to read this thread me and my PCD would LOVE suggestions.
@holly_sruart I had my scaphoid removed and a 4 corners fusion which has cause the muscles in my forearm to atrophy and become spastic. Which pulls on my fusion and my confused nerve cluster causing fairly constant excruciating pain.
@holly_sruart I can‚Äôt feel burning but run a feather across my hand I‚Äôll scream out in excruciating pain. I have to sleep with my hand wrapped in lidocaine patches or a Velcro lined glove to replace the sensation. Velcro I have found is very soothing for the nerve ‚Äúburn‚Äù associated with nerves
@holly_sruart Type 2 chronic regional pain syndrome. Type 1 is much more common treated with mirror therapy pt etc. type 2 on the other hand isn‚Äôt from brain misfiring is cause by the clipping of a nerve and the nerve growing back causing a sensation flip.

@ravensspirit68 @ChronicP_Ass @Bicked_Wetch As proven by activist and dr @DanLairdMD amongst others most of the so called opiate deaths probably have nothing to do with opiates. Most of those people had scores of other issues or drugs/alcohol in their system. Why are doctors and nurses letting their patients go unheard?
@ravensspirit68 @ChronicP_Ass @Bicked_Wetch There is no quick solution to these major issues but this mass abandonment of patients is obscene and has dangerous consequences for the American people.   Yes people abuse drugs. But those people don‚Äôt just abuse opiates. There are 1000‚Äôs of other things you can abuse.
@ravensspirit68 @ChronicP_Ass @Bicked_Wetch This abuse of the American people is being compounded by doctors and nurses refusing to speak up and be the squeaky wheel.  The real numbers and information is available to anyone. Takes a couple days of research to prove its lie/propaganda fueled hysteria.
@ravensspirit68 @ChronicP_Ass @Bicked_Wetch As far as accepting our pain... seriously? They call it intolerable intractable pain for a reason. It‚Äôs INTOLERABLE!  Pain patients shouldn‚Äôt have to wait months-years for help. This leads to multitudes of other issues like heart failure, stroke, mental health disorders and more.
@ravensspirit68 @ChronicP_Ass @Bicked_Wetch While mindfulness may help in long term care by helping keep/restore brain matter as indicated in studies it is not a short term solution or any real help.

@latchkeykidd @RutiRegan @jnickrand NSAIDs kill just as many of not more people than prescription opiates every year when taken as prescribed.  Estimated nsaid deaths per year are between 16-20k through the form of gi bleeds and other side effects. No opiates aren‚Äôt the right choice for everyone but just as safe.
@RutiRegan @leemovic @HilaryKimMorden We don‚Äôt have an opioid addiction crisis either. We have a toxic black market drug supply. Most of the deaths from illicit fentanyl which is nothing like what a doctor would prescribe come from mixing it with cocaine and heroin and giving it to people who don‚Äôt know it‚Äôs there
@leemovic @RutiRegan No we do not in fact have an opioid crisis. We have an illegal drug crisis because they are being poisoned with toxic levels of a powdered form of fentanyl which is many times stronger than the fentanyl you‚Äôll get from a doctor.

@03_jensen @marias_pain @latchkeykidd @RutiRegan @jnickrand NSAIDs cause almost as many deaths annually as non illicit opiates through the form of gi bleeds and stomach issues and the other various life threatening side affects.

@justmichellem77 @ThomasKlineMD @newsobserver And came with your records to prove it. Then they demonize you if you ren out early or called to get a refill.
