Mental health pro @HeatherKellyPhD of @APA explains in the article, financial stress had a direct connection to increased likelihood of suicide -- not just among veterans, but among all people. @WillAttig is right to use this language. Financial instability is dangerous.
"veterans, as well as others, are at... risk for self-harm when facing economic hardship. Negative life-stressors, such as divorce, loss of a job and financial instability, are correlated with death by suicide" Via @nikkiwentling @starsandstripes https://t.co/gkZKhLgP91

@NotALegume @Lkatzenberg @AN_Goldstein @VFWHQ @NYTimesAtWar @jestei All things considered, the anger some responded with was good. Got everyone in the community to focus on sharing stories about old school VSOs working hand-in-hand with new orgs. If we’re mad about “negative” coverage and that inspires us to come closer together - we all win.
@NotALegume @Lkatzenberg @AN_Goldstein @VFWHQ @NYTimesAtWar @jestei I think some people (VFW rant as example) are having somewhat knee jerk reactions and reading the piece through their lens — rather than from perspective of a regular NYT reader who knows nothing about vets and vets orgs.
@NotALegume @Lkatzenberg @AN_Goldstein @VFWHQ @NYTimesAtWar @jestei For the record: Jennifer was careful to make sure she had my approval to use the quote. Did right by me. I could have been more clear in saying new vets groups feel tangible because of things like merch, whereas traditional VSOs seem more abstract — to vets outside our bubble.

@BrianBWagner Ruined Christmas roast is not a time for jokes, @BrianBWagner.
@chrisalbon I had given it a generous coat of sea salt yesterday to give it a ~24 hour period where the salt could seep in, begin to break down the proteins for flavor and texture. Lauren’s sis later caught Mom’s partner washing prime rib in the sink.
Can confirm. This is a Christmas tragedy. Might as well go to McDonalds and string together some gross beef patties and call it a rib roast. https://t.co/cPKYB3XC4v
Finally, I'd like to thank all of my friends in the @TrumanProject community who worked their networks to make the connections necessary to ensure this veteran was safe.
I'd also like to thank friends in the press -- the fourth estate -- who also provided assistance, reaching out to their sources to provide leads.
A bunch of these government employees that I know of weren't even on duty -- and they acted out of a deep commitment to service on their own time, during a major holiday. They could have turned off their phones, stopped reading email, and let someone else handle it.
People throughout the @DeptVetAffairs , @RealNCIS, @USMC, @DeptofDefense and more -- plus at least three state and three city governments mobilized to find him and make sure he was safe.

@WillofSnow @birdgirl1001 @B_Appelquist @KateHoit @DeptVetAffairs “They” certainly do care about mental health. Over the last decade that I’ve received care at the VA, I’ve had proactive doctors who seek to make sure I make it to regular appointments. Sometimes — they go on vacation. Just like docs in the private sector.
@B_Appelquist Suicide prevention outreach is a critical part of the mission. Veterans who don’t use the V.A. system are far more likely to die by suicide than their peers. This would be robbing Peter to pay Paul.
@birdgirl1001 @B_Appelquist @KateHoit @DeptVetAffairs Okay, without knowing the specifics of his diagnoses or type of therapy, it’s difficult to speculate on what could be best for him as a patient. He has the right to get therapy at any Vet Center. Is there any one that’s closer? https://t.co/ld9w0Cvw5a

@MarkFooterman @AlJazeera @UN Being invaded, occupying. Tomato, tomato. Not a rhetorical question: Have you had an opportunity to ever get to know a Palestinian family? I ask because those that I have don’t think they’re invading the homes they’ve lived in for their entire lives.
@MarkFooterman @AlJazeera @UN Few western countries have a habit of regularly firing live rounds at civilians, but 🤷🏻‍♂️
@MarkFooterman @AlJazeera @UN To be clear — I didn’t get hit by enemy fire. This happened here in the States as a result of a ricochet.
@MarkFooterman @AlJazeera @UN Think about this conversation. A kid died, and because of his ethnicity, you’re pretending that it didn’t happen — based on a total lack of understanding of ballistics and claiming false expertise. This is what monsters do. And you accuse me of being a terrorist sympathizer?
@MarkFooterman @AlJazeera @UN Did you miss tweet where I said I’d been personally hit with shrapnel from a bullet? Did I get hit with bullet shrapnel so I could one day sympathize with Hamas? Wtf?
@MarkFooterman @AlJazeera @UN Wait — is it a manicured grassy field? I haven’t seen photos of this particular incident, but my guess is there are some rocks if the Palestinians were throwing them at the Israelis.
@MarkFooterman @AlJazeera @UN I’ll give you a hint — if the rock is anything softer than steel, there’s a good chance shrapnel is going to kick up with enough force to cut through flesh.
@MarkFooterman @AlJazeera @UN What happens when a bullet hits a rock on the ground, and a kid is behind that rock?
@MarkFooterman @AlJazeera @UN And — worth mentioning — I’ve personally been hit with shrapnel from a bullet.
@MarkFooterman @AlJazeera @UN (Tweeting again b/c of bad link and spelling error). Here’s a US government study on wounds from bullet shrapnel. https://t.co/UiEqxnObSJ?
@MarkFooterman @AlJazeera @UN This is why we’re trained not to hug walls when fighting down an alley. Even if the ricocheted bullet (when it breaks apart is by definition shrapnel) missed you — bits and pieces of walls (also shrapnel) can kill you just as well.
@MarkFooterman @AlJazeera @UN I don’t know if the Times of Israel is a Palestinian rag or not, but they’re using the same language.		As someone who understands physics and ballistics, I can assure you that shrapnel can be caused by *anything* that’s moving quickly.

@jenniab91 Of course. What’s up?
And here we already have @realDonaldTrump’s words already being used to justify the murder of civilian by despotic regimes on the other side of the world.		https://t.co/E3EGe5PGyd
Any event even close to this will do what the Abu Ghraib photos did — and Guantanamo does today — in terms of damage to USA’s reputation and standing in the world.		Except the victims in this case are refugees. Women. Children. Babies.
Will military or police forces from outside the US be present and on the other side of the border in this hypothetical scenario? Maybe. Could be a recipe for a death-blossom, where one single shot triggers a horrible mess of counter-fire.
First of all, even a single round fired from an M-4 into a crowd of men, women and children, can result in multiple serious casualties or even deaths. In the immediate term, it could escalate use of force from anyone present.
For @POTUS to openly muse that American troops should treat rocks as rifles is absolutely inappropriate, and incredibly dangerous. If some young, impressionable soldier hears that and interprets it as permission to violate rules of engagement, it would be a disaster.
I spent most of 2005 in Sadr City, Baghdad, an incredibly densely populated area. Every day my platoon had countless rocks, bottles, bricks thrown at us while on patrol. We very often got hit. Some, in the face. It sucked. But we never, never fired a shot in anger at civilians.

8/ Many -- in fact most -- of the pages that I've evaluated don't have their admins revealed, as @facebook is concentrating on pages that have bought ads or have huge followings. To be fair... that's what congress has asked for. But it's not enough.
7/ To see where a Facebook *Group* is from, go to the group and click "about" to see the list of admins. Click on the admins's profile photos and check to see where they've checked in, what pages they like, and what language they use in their posts.
6/ To see where a Facebook *Page* is run from, go to the page on your desktop and click "Info and Ads" on the bottom of the left column. If the page has a large enough following (well over 100k) or if they've bought political ads, you can see what country the admins live in.
5/ "Veterans Nation - Honoring All Who Served" is run by admins in Kosovo.		https://t.co/YwgbMPWCWC
4/ It's really important to be careful about what you share on the internet. Groups like "Veteran 2 Veteran Info" are run by Americans. Not every group or page that looks like it's made for veterans is. https://t.co/8CvSaYtcXx
3/ Many are from Eastern Europe and Southeast Asia, but made to look like Americans expressing their patriotism.
2/ Many Americans -- including my colleagues at major Veterans Service Organizations -- need to be more careful about what they share on social media, and who created it. I've found tons of sites targeting troops, veterans and police, which are run by admins from outside USA

@MarkFooterman @CoryBooker @KamalaHarris @maziehirono Bro. Who are you trying to impress with these dumbass tweets?

To politicize Senator John McCain’s death is to honor the man, and to celebrate his life and the things that he stood for. I’m happy to play a small part in that.
He wanted to remind us that American greatness isn’t achieved by the shallow, cheap-plastic branding of Trumpism — but by vigorous and sincere debate to advance the values espoused in our nation’s founding documents.
McCain’s parting shot was meant to be a devastating blow against @realDonaldTrump , and everything that the current @POTUS stands for.
He meant for us — Americans of all political stripes — to be politically alive in the week following his death.  He carefully orchestrated every inch that his casket would take across this country, and who would be there to deliver his carefully crafted final message.
To complain about the politicization of @SenJohnMcCain’s death is to fail to understand the man’s history and his last wishes. McCain was a political animal, through and through. Since his diagnosis of his terminal illness, he met with his staff weekly to discuss his legacy.

Since preparing that report I've spent the entire summer tracking these and similar trolls. Through direct contact w Facebook's Threat Intel team I've had a bunch of pages and groups shut down, freeing over 1 million users from foreign influence.
Here's a report that I prepared for congress and the various alphabet agencies back in March, before I fell into the rabbit hole and discovered just how big this problem is. https://t.co/kZsvGmNkmG
My tracking began with fighting trolls (located in Bulgaria, according to site registry) who were imitating my employer, @VVAmerica, a congressionally-chartered Veteran Service Organization. They were producing falsified news and growing exponentially before shutdown.

#Rhodesia sound familiar, but you don't know where you last heard it? It's because you heard that convicted mass-murderer #DylanRoof used the online persona "The Last Rhodesian," which the media often reported without spelling out full context for viewers/readers.
Like the #PepeTheFrog meme, when regular people see this kind of stuff cross their feed for the first time, they often don't recognize it for what it is.
Until @johnismay started questioning @facebook and @instagram during his investigation for @NYTimesAtWar about why the social media companies allowed white supremacists to use their platform to spread messages of hate, these groups were able to easily and openly recruit online.
For the millennials like me who had never heard of Rhodesia -- #Rhodesia was a #WhiteEthnostate near #SouthAfrica, where whites refused to give up power when democratic forces took hold. Yes -- the country that is now Zimbabwe has serious problems -- but it used to be far worse.
In the article above, @johnismay of @NYTimesAtWar details how Trump's campaign language "#MakeAmericaGreatAgain" was adopted by #WhiteSupremacist groups to openly discuss ethnic cleansing on social media, with slogans like "Make Zimbabwe Rhodesia Again."
Last night @realDonaldTrump tweeted abt "#WhiteGenocide for the 1st time as President. Surprising -- since his concerns with Africa have been limited to saying "#shitholecountries." This idea has been below the surface of the #FarRight for a while now.	https://t.co/Ib0mrXaiUe

@AlexanderMcCoy4 @VFWHQ You literally hold the power to encourage tons of progressive vets to flood the org and completely change it in any way you want like two to three years. Withholding membership over ideological differences is counterproductive.
@AlexanderMcCoy4 @VFWHQ Like I said in the other sub-comment — as long as you withhold your membership and voting power from the org, those literally working to purge Nazis from the org are working without your help. You and your friends join, vote as a block, and fix it. Or, complain on Twitter. https://t.co/QEg6Aucm41

@AlexanderMcCoy4 @VFWHQ Also relevant: https://t.co/9bbKukLynm
@TempleOfRoo @VFWHQ Thanks, brother. Much appreciated.
@TempleOfRoo @VFWHQ Your concerns have merit, but this is historically consistent. The vast majority of Americans, as far as I can tell, are not tracking the NRA investigation story. I wouldn't expect the planners of this event to have the foresight to modify a guest list well ahead of recent news
@TempleOfRoo @VFWHQ I mean... he’s the president. That may suck (for national security, veterans healthcare, human decency), but it’s not VFW’s fault. VFW shouldn’t be expected to not invite the CiC to their convention, whatever the politics. It gives VFW members an opportunity to see CiC in person.
@TempleOfRoo @VFWHQ To be clear, I’m not a reporter. Just a guy who works for a VSO. And VSOs can’t help but be “out of touch” with people who refuse to participate. It’s like non-voters sitting at home on Election Day whining about politics. Easiest way to be without representation is to stay home.

Of course auto-correct puts a curse in my first tweet in the thread... “Shut down” with a U.
My hope is that rather than simply shut down the pages I identify, that they’ll quietly study them and learn how they operate. Playing whack-a-mole one at a time doesn’t work. We need system-wide protections.
What’s good is that I’m now in contact with Facebook’s Threat Intel team. They’re the real experts in this kind of thing, and are reviewing my findings to do deep-dives where appropriate.
I’m honestly not sure if I’m even making a dent with the stuff I’m finding. Most pages and sites hide who is operating them. Facebook won’t release info about these nefarious actors, as they have user/privacy rights.
I’ve identified pages targeting patriotic Americans that originate in Morocco, Sri Lanka, India, Netherlands, Germany, France, Canada, Mexico, Bulgaria, and a host of other counties around the globe. Most push falsified and sensationalized news. Some auto-download malware (fun!)
Here’s hundreds of pages of screenshots, with some rough notes trying it all together. As far as I can tell... my work is nowhere near done. The pages targeting veterans were connected to pages targeting cops. The pages targeting cops were connected to pages about patriotism... https://t.co/gRVAAWLEcd
Then in February I figured out the same troll farm had two backup pages to copy VVA... created in 2015! Since then I’ve spent an unbelievable amount of time trying to identify and expose all of the foreign-run pages that target American veterans with political propaganda.
11 months ago I discovered that a a group of trolls with Russian-sounding names had built a website and @facebook page to mimic @VVAmerica. By the time we got it shit down, it had almost a quarter million followers. Little did I know that was just the tip of the iceberg. https://t.co/nNHyi9UdwD

I won’t say the pain is “gone.” I still feel the pinch of nerve pain now and then. But instead of hitting hard and fast, and staying high-pain for minutes... the spike comes, and it fades immediately.		#CBDjournal
At first, I thought the pain filling could just be a placebo effect (and maybe it still is) but one week in, I’m at a wedding, after driving 8+ hrs in less than two days, and I’m feeling fine.		#CBDjournal
Electric-like pain starts in the left shoulder, and radiates down and around my left arm.		A few triggers: driving (left hand on top of steering wheel), sleeping without Rx pillow, wearing a suit/tux with tie, carrying a bag.		#BCDjournal
Taking 2 doses of the extra strength stuff listed above: 1 morning with coffee, 1 before bed. A full dropper each time.		I’ve got 2 herniated disks in my neck that have kept me in near constant pain for over a year now.		#CBDjournal
This thread doesn’t reflect the views of my employer:		I’ve advocated for #veterans to be able to use cannabis crime-free for a few years now because so many of my friends swear by it, even though I didn’t use it myself.		Today is day 7 of my use of #cbdOil. @CWHemp #CBDjournal https://t.co/nOJDNwcBDF

@MarkFooterman @SenateDems He once ruled against an immigrant teen who wanted an abortion: https://t.co/qT8HTd7Cm3
@MarkFooterman @SenateDems Can you cite a source for that analysis, please? I'm yet to see one that declares K to be a centrist. His donations go to Republicans: https://t.co/8PDUiskYDo
@MarkFooterman @SenateDems Year after year, Democrats gain more votes than Republicans for the POTUS, House and Senate, yet the minority party is given the seats due to gerrymandering, the electoral college, and the makeup of the Senate. There’s no other way to look at it than as minority rule.
@MarkFooterman @SenateDems The facts are that Dems are rightfully concerned because after the majority of the country was robbed of a SCOTUS seat in 2016, it’s being reshaped by a ruling minority to go hard right for generations.
@MarkFooterman @SenateDems Furthermore, when you say K is “centered,” you’re not trying to say he’s “centrist,” right? Because that’d be a terrible misinterpretation of the facts.		https://t.co/RPjUvDJ3RF
@MarkFooterman @SenateDems And Trump promised to appoint judges who.... what was that again? Something about “automatically” and Roe vs Wade?
@MarkFooterman @SenateDems So what you’re saying is that we should casually accept that the President lied about his priorities for a SCOTUS pick? It’s dem’s fault for believing the President intends to fulfill his campaign promises?

This is not a small population, btw. The VA said last year that 505,000 veterans today are living with OTH discharges, most of whom have never had care from the VA.
So, are veterans with #badpaper included in the study at all? Or were they omitted because they didn't meet the study's definition of "veteran?" We've faced this problem before. The effect could be that the most likely to die by suicide were excluded from the study.

@MarkFooterman /End rant. Haha, forgot about the tread. I’m a little spacey after going out last night.
@MarkFooterman Your statistic about “50 out of 60 protestors” being members of Hamas still means that for ever 5 terrorists killed, 1 civilian is murdered. That’s a very, very high rate of civilian casualties by any standard, *especially* when using direct-fire weapons.
@MarkFooterman In short, the IDF soldiers faced nowhere near the risk that would justify their actions. I get the “tough on crime” theory, but I believe in human rights (and am equally critical of American cops who murder civilians).
@MarkFooterman I spoke with a witness to the most recent protests/murders, a friend who was there as press, and her descriptions of what occurred were horrifying. She said no pictures/video could do what happened justice, as Israel prevented media from access to view entire event.
@MarkFooterman On a personal level, in my experience facing protestors who were throwing rocks and Molotov cocktails at my platoon — and hitting and injuring many of us — I never fired a round because I didn’t think it was a legitimate reason to kill a civilian.
@MarkFooterman This piece:	https://t.co/J53Lm1ZukI
@MarkFooterman To continue that thought — here’s a great piece on Americans murdering Iraqis, and the military failing to prosecute vets who belong in jail. We don’t declare it an anti-American piece because it doesn’t also say in the headline “Al Qaeda is also bad too!” It’s honest reporting.
@MarkFooterman Criticizing IDF is not anti-Jew. When we criticize war crimes (which is what murdering civilians is) there is no need to mention Hamas. When talking about Americans killing in civilians in Vietnam it’s not legitimate to say “but the Viet-Cong were worse!”
@MarkFooterman The sentence that references Chabad could have perhaps been more clear, but the focus is meant to be on what is revealed in this loooong piece. (I got bored and stopped reading less than half way through this one). https://t.co/T74iPM4qXP
@MarkFooterman (This is going to take a while, I’ll let you know when I’m done with my analysis. I’ll keep commenting as a thread)
@MarkFooterman His reference to Chabad is not to demonize the entire organization, it’s only in reference to a specific incident/location/group on Long Island.
@MarkFooterman Okay, after reading the article and some of the pieces in its embedded links, I think I can respond. I think your assessment that this is an “anti-Israel, anti-Jew, anti-Semitic” hit-piece misses the mark. I don’t interpret it that way at all.
@MarkFooterman First thoughts before reading his piece — if the guy calls himself a “provocateur” in his Twitter bio, then blocks you for calling him out, he’s just a dickhead.

@InAnIntWorld @realDonaldTrump @Al_Baldasaro Someone told them that Snopes is a liberal propaganda site, so they totally dismiss it.
@MarkFooterman On Hillary — the Lewinsky scandal is what made me a young Republican. I was of course too young to vote until 2003, but yeah, that whole mess made me swear off the Democratic Party for years.
@MarkFooterman I totally get you on the Godwin’s law thing. However, as someone who has been targeted by Nazis online, I can tell you it’s not *all* over-blown. It’s going to take a min, but lemme see if I have screenshots...
@MarkFooterman I don’t think that a perfectly clean candidate is necessary (or possible). I don’t mind, as a Hillary voter, behind held to account for her mistakes and shortcomings. If we keep blaming politicians alone — and not the voters who put them in power — we allow our republic to erode

@MarkFooterman ...can explain much of her refusal to believe allegations against her husband. But all things being as they are, we had a man who bragged about sexual assault vs the victim of Bill’s wrongdoings.
@MarkFooterman (Twitter tip - respond to your own tweet if it’s the latest one in the convo stays in one thread.) I think you do raise a legitimate point re Clinton supporters and Hillary’s past silencing of victims. However, I recognize that Hillary’s being the victim of infidelity...
@MarkFooterman And therein lies the problem. That white people (and yes, even millions of minorities) are willing to allow racism to flourish and multiply — because they have more selfish worries.
@MarkFooterman You are correct in that the top priority of individual voters is diverse. I expect that this CNN commentator would respond to you by saying that what they showed with their priorities is that they’re willing to tolerate racism if the party/economy/anti-Hillary thing is right.
@MarkFooterman Tolerance of racism, is, in my view, support for racism. It’s up to us — the privileged — to speak out against racism and actively work to dismantle racist societal structure. Neutrality on the issue is beneath us.
@MarkFooterman I see your point, but I think you’re failing to see the point of the CNN commentator.		What she is saying is that if someone supports a racist, and they’re supporting that racist’s racist policies, then that makes them a racist.		I think the logic is pretty sound on that.

@tweetingmatty @kevincline1993 I agree with you. Small mistakes shouldn't permanently ban someone from ownership. But big things like domestic violence and stalking (common among people who commit murder) should get people banned from firearm ownership.
@tweetingmatty @kevincline1993 First of all, I didn't say "we should ban guns." I believe in smart regulation. Same as cars. Training, testing, licensing, registration, inspections, maintenance, liability insurance.

@kevincline1993 Like you said, this isn’t a hypothetical. There are people walking into schools and murdering innocent people all the time.
@kevincline1993 There’s a person carrying a firearm with a high-capacity magazine on my campus close to graduation day, I’m going to assume they’re a threat. Just like any good-guy with a gun would, it would be up to me to act before someone starts mirdering people.
@kevincline1993 Say I had a concealed carry permit, and I saw this woman on my campus. Say I saw her and, considering all the school shootings, thought she was intending on shooting people at graduation. I’ve identified a threat, one with a high-capacity mag, why should I not fire first?
@kevincline1993 These statistics are anomalous among advanced nations. It only happens here, because of the proliferation of guns. Your guns may not kill, but the laws that allow murderers to get them too does kill. So do lax laws about storage and locking.
@kevincline1993 Every day, 318 people in America are shot in murders, assaults, suicides &amp; suicide attempts, unintentional shootings, and police intervention.		Every day 96 people die from gun violence: 		34 are murdered	59 die from suicide	1 killed unintentionally	1 killed by legal intervention

15/ If this is a highly-unlikely scenario of a massive conspiracy of servicemembers and veterans (who WH can EASILY identify) then they'll soon be rooted out. I have confidence that @VAChair, having said he "has no problem" with Tester's vetting of Jackson, already vetted them.
14/ And last point -- #Whistleblowers need to be protected. @DoD_IG has a responsibility to look into the allegations against Jackson. If the serious ones are proven true, he needs to be made an example of, not allowed to retire with full benefits.
13/ Don't fall for the political bait set by the @POTUS, who is, at this time, blaming his mistakes on everyone but himself. Let's return to regular order and stop using veterans as pawns in a dirty political game. WH needs to speak to stakeholders, deliberate, + not be impulsive
12/ Tester acted honorably to represent the people of Montana, + to protect the veterans he serves as Ranking member of SVAC. So did Isakson, when he took the testimony of nearly two dozen servicemembers and veterans seriously + delayed Johnson's confirmation hearing indefinitely
11/ There is no due process in the world of politics, so that's a completely illegitimate point. Remember chants of "lock her up! lock her up! lock her up!" Remember the President and @SarahHuckabee using the WH podium to call American citizens criminals ALL THE TIME.
10/ On the alleged targeting of a sacred military officer: What needs to be remembered is that military officers, as well-liked as they may be in their circles, are NOT above scrutiny, especially if they accept a nomination for a political post.
9/ And I'm 100% sure I've spent a hell of a lot more time behind the wheel than any White House doctor or General officer. I'm suspecting that 3 incidents in 5 years is indicative of a problem that goes beyond just driving. Dunno if it's alcohol or road rage. But it is something.
8/ What might cause 3 incidents like this in 5 years? I recognize that personal experience shouldn't be extrapolated into assumptions about norms, but I've been driving for over 16 years and haven't had an accident in, well, 16 years. (1 with a permit, though, at age 15.)
7/ Keep in mind, the @WhiteHouse did acknowledge 3 vehicular incidents in the last 5 years. 2 collisions and 1 road rage incident. And that's just government vehicles. Does that alone not raise your suspicions, Mr President?
6/ Isakson at least once before the nomination was even formally filed -- and the White House chose to move full-steam ahead... without pausing to do an actual vetting of Jackson or of the allegations.
5/ Think everyone from criminals #BillCosby and #JerrySandusky, to @EricGreitens and @RealMGrimm.		On blaming this on @SVACDems: @VAChair Johnny Isakson twice called the @WhiteHouse in the week before any allegations went public to express his reservations about Jackson
4/ Then, on the "character assassination" and career-ruining of Admiral Jackson: I hate to break it to you, but well-liked high-ranking, powerful people of all stripes have their misdeeds go hidden all the time.
3/ As much as I like and respect Wilkie both personally and professionally, his appointment caused chaos and confusion that didn't need to happen. Deputy Secretary Tom Bowman was a longtime Republican with lots of relevant experience, already Senate confirmed for VA position.
2/ Remember, @SecShulkin was fired with no backup plan. Deputy VA Bowman was then passed on in violation of historical norms + Vacancies Act. A DoD official was named to run VA, setting the stage for lawsuits, distrust, and undermining VA employee's trust in political leadership.
1/ Thread on Admiral Jackson and the latest @DeptVetAffairs drama:		For @realDonaldTrump to assign blame to @jontester for this VA debacle is a sign of blindness to the way that this happened and/or deliberate politicization of veterans issues.		https://t.co/FDSsTErMnJ
@MarkFooterman @KyleKashuv That’s a miscarriage, which yes, is an incredibly terrible le thing for many, many women. But abortions are a choice and medical procedures, miscarriages are not. During an abortion there is no displaying of the fetus to the woman.
@MarkFooterman @KyleKashuv Honest question: What was it about the abortion joke that bothered you? The “don’t knock it til you try it” thing? Is it because it belittled the seriousness of what you consider a life-and-death issue? I suppose I can understand that.
@MarkFooterman @KyleKashuv And thank you for the kind words, btw.
@MarkFooterman @KyleKashuv I can’t say I’m too familiar with conservative comedians, but I can’t think of one off the top of my head that ever said something that I found to be over the limit. I grew up watching George Carlin (live a block from George Carlin St btw) and basically go by his standards.
@MarkFooterman @KyleKashuv Was that part of the jokes last night?
@MarkFooterman @KyleKashuv I don’t know who that is... so I don’t really get the reference.

I was in the room when he said it. Nearly every advocate, member of congress, and reporter who know I was in the packed hearing room turned to me with gleaming smiles. They knew that at that moment, the change we had collectively worked for was suddenly possible.
But within weeks of @SecShulkin being sworn in, he took action. He declared at a @HouseVetAffairs/@VetAffairsDems March 2017 hearing that he was "not going to wait on congress." That was going to expand access to vets with #OTH discharges "because it's the right thing to do."
I've been pushing congress to fix the #badpaper issue for over a decade. My colleagues at @VVAmerica have been doing it for nearly a half century. Congress had always told us it'd be "too expensive" to pass a bill to bring these vets back in from the cold.
One of Secretary Shulkin's greatest accomplishments in his short tenure was changing the culture at @DeptVetAffairs to be welcoming to veterans with #badpaper. In doing so, he created the momentum necessary to open up access to as many as 505,000 veterans previously denied care.
2 years ago I wrote about "The Mental Healthcare Bill for Vets No One is Talking About." An *improved* version passed 2 weeks ago (tks @BetoORourke+ @ChrisMurphyCT ). Thanks to the chaos caused by the firing of @SecShulkin, the story mostly got buried. https://t.co/sfK8VLF6mg

@OhioAmvets @HighGroundVets Here's a link that describes the VA's guidelines for MST claims. I hope this is helpful. https://t.co/yyPYVbLIPf
@OhioAmvets @HighGroundVets I was under the impression that under current laws and regulations that an MST survivor only needs to indicate that there was an incident and there are resulting symptoms to file a claim. Have you experienced other barriers? Knowing the perpetrator shouldn’t matter for claims.
@OhioAmvets @HighGroundVets That’s a very important issue, + it’s something that we’d love to hear your suggestions on. But as we’re training our advocates, they choose their own narrow policy proposals so that there’s a clear goal to accomplish. Important not to bite off more than you can chew in training!
They'll be tackling some timely + ambitious issues including: improving prenatal services for MST survivors, creating consistency in the Vocational Rehabilitation Program, bringing an end to the "Widow's Tax," and modernizing nondiscrimination protections for the LGBT community!

Just got off the phone with @Tmobile’s help desk from @verizon, where I was told I’d have to wait TWO WEEKS for an unlock. Meanwhile, grandma’s emergency phone doesn’t work. @verizon’s best offer of a solution was minimum $400+ to buy the same model iPhone.
Apparently, @TMobile “unlocked” the wrong phone (despite a very-different IMEI number) so when I put in the @verizon SIM card, I entered a locked limbo where neither provider or @Apple can just simply fix it.
I’m in a position now where, despite assurances from all involved that this should be an easy process, everyone wants me to pay hundreds of dollars for a new phone when the one I have is in perfect shape. All companies pointing fingers at one another, with hands out asking for $
Switching my poor grandma’s @Apple iPhone from @TMobile to @verizon was pitched to me as easy, but holy hell, it’s 5 days later, three trips to Verizon, two to T-mobile, and I don’t know how many hours on customer service calls... I have an expensive brick.

Ummm... Update... Just got a press release from @RepMikeCoffman bragging about voting against his own bill. Dude. Come on.
These are vast improvements, but there are populations still left behind. @RepJenniffer tried to amend earlier versions of this text to include vets who participated in disaster relief. The amendment was struck down over cost. This happened shortly before #PR was devastated.
2) Drone operators, who may never leave CONUS but who may have witnessed or participated in deadly action.	3) Those who are operating outside of designated combat zones, but where hostilities are present. Think AFRICOM.
Often left out, but not left out today:	1) MST survivors, who will gain access to facilities outside VA if deemed appropriate for care. This is in response to many survivors who understandably feel uncomfortable around crowds and certain populations.
The bipartisan result of this compromise builds upon and makes permanent Shulkin's efforts to #LeaveNoVetBehind. https://t.co/6UQvTNtIA3

.@AUSNTweets: “we must emphasize the need to care for our green and #BlueWaterNavy #veterans.”
.@iava on the need to focus attention on #ToxicExposures: “#BurnPits could be the #AgentOrange of our generation. Just mentioning them brings back memories for me of the putrid stench of burn-pits in Baghdad.”
Rowan continues: “the hospitals in the private sector are run like cartels. There’s no such thing as ‘real choice’ in the private sector, because everything belongs to the same group of people. We need to get the VA staffing to the level it belongs.”
Speaking on his experience with VA care: “last year I had heart surgery three weeks before my testimony before this committee. I am retired from the City of New York. I can get the best healthcare in the world because of where I live — and I choose the VA because it’s the best.”

Let's get to the root of the problem, @USAfricaCommand. Let's get lawmakers to pursue research/funding for encrypted helmet-cameras for all of our troops. This could be in the next NDAA if you start asking for it now.
AFRICOM said in a statement. “We encourage the news media to deny ISIS a propaganda success by not purchasing, showing or bringing undue attention to these images as it re-victimizes the affected families, amplifies IS atrocities and aids in their recruiting.”
Video encryption would decrease the incentive for terrorist groups to kill, and then obtain the bodies of American troops. I don't care how expensive it is, but we ought to be developing this technology and replacing all helmet-cameras.
Hopefully this prompts a movement to ensure that the military develops and issues encrypted helmet-cameras that the enemy cannot steal video from.
I'm not linking to the video (or even searching for it) but people should know that it's out there. The source of the video was taken from the helmet-cameras of our deceased brothers.

So -- the gauntlet's been thrown down. "These are the times that try men's souls: The summer soldier and the sunshine patriot will, in this crisis, shrink from the service of his country; but he that stands it now, deserves the love and thanks of man and woman." #VetsForGunReform
Having lived in a small town in the rural south, it's easy to imagine what it would be like if Walmart were suddenly no longer an option. The small businesses that survive in an area where a Walmart is the center of economic activity cannot sustain the town alone.

As General Washington is credited with once saying: "The willingness with which our young people are likely to serve in any way, no matter how justified, shall be directly proportional to how they perceive veterans of earlier wars were treated and appreciated by our nation."
It's a national security priority. If people see the friends and family that they know join the military, become wounded, injured or ill -- then be denied the right and ability to access a healthcare system designed to aid veterans recover... they're not going to serve.
Both the short-term and long-term goals here are counter to everything that ought to be considered patriotic. Support for veteran healthcare isn't just fulfilling a promise that was made to Americans who run into harms' way to protect the nation and our Constitution.
In the end, private healthcare CEOs (political donors like the #KochBrothers) get more money, and when congress sees how expensive private care is, veterans' healthcare vouchers eventually get rationed.
It becomes a self-licking ice cream cone, where a failing VA justifies the allocation of fewer resources, and fewer resources continually dismantles VA.
...vacancies at the @DeptVetAffairs ? The answer: the goal is to privatize #veteran healthcare. By focusing entirely on firing bad-actors while refusing to take extraordinary efforts to hire quality staff, the VA can do nothing but fail to meet expectations.

@lawnorder7 @VAWhistleblowr @nikkiwentling @DAVHQ @SecShulkin @realDonaldTrump At first glance, you may say "123 suicides per day x 7.3% of vets among population would only by about 9 veteran suicides per day" and you'd be right, if data were that simple.

"More guns" in the hands of non-professionals in what soldiers would call "kill-zones" is just... dumb. It ignores the facts. We can, and should do better. Let's keep the weapons of war out of civilian hands, full stop.
The answer to this problem, is not the one suggested by @POTUS and @NRA's chief voices: @DLoesch and Wayne LaPierre. School hallways are long tunnels, hard walls and floors. Perfect environment for bullets ricochet, turn into shrapnel, and tear flesh.
Anonymous, plain-clothes teachers who occasionally visit a gun range trying to respond to a deranged individual with an AR-15 in a crowded school -- while police are attempting to figure out what the hell is going on -- is only going to get more kids killed.
Soldiers in a warzone, and SWAT teams rely more on their radios than their weapons to coordinate their actions. They wear uniforms for a reason -- to let their teammates, bystanders and targets know who the good guys are.
Furthermore -- being effective in combat takes a team, and it takes practice to maintain those skills. The myth of onsies and twosies of retired police officers and veterans playing hero during an active shooter scenario in a school is nuts.
They're already spending their own money to supplement the needs of their students, whom they love and support in ways I can't begin to explain for them. Not one of them have the time or energy to spare to become proficiently trained in urban combat and still teach their kids.
I don't know any teachers who want to carry weapons to school. (If I'm wrong, feel free to chime in). They have enough to worry about.
Other childhood friends became officers of the law or joined the military. These are two different types of people, who chose two different paths in life, whose training and education honed vastly different skills.
When rounds are flying in both directions, in a gunfight the NYPD hits their target only 13% of the time.		The idea that arming teachers will protect children is preposterous. I know this because plenty of my childhood friends grew up to be teachers, and I'm listening to them.
The @nytimes Editorial Board nails it with this piece: "Let the Teachers Teach." 		Statistics show that show that the NYPD hits their target about 1/3 of the time when they're the only ones shooting. 		https://t.co/A6Edpx5aA4
Combat #veteran here to enter the #VetsForGunReform debate in support of the kids of #MarchForOurLives, with a reality check for my @NRA buddies. "One shot, one kill" is a myth outside very controlled combat scenarios when shooter is hidden, relatively safe from returning fire.

@AlexHortonTX Perhaps if you've just had more time to digest these things and have become numb to that which is news to the VSOs. To us (at least my org), the memo was a surprising turn of events -- and confirmed some of our worst fears -- that VA is being deliberately sabotaged from inside.
@AlexHortonTX Are you tracking the Leinenkugel memo? WH advisors want him out. Everyone knows that Trump believes in whatever he hears last. The WH advisors have access to Trump. We don’t. Thjs is a Hail Mary, in my opinion. I imagine Selznick and Leinenkugel are whispering in Trump’s ear rn
@AlexHortonTX ...that is, defying the WH advisors are the easiest way to get cut out. Easier route would be go with the flow. 2) No one is defending the “status quo.” They’re fighting to see continued improvement for the best healthcare system that the US has got.
@AlexHortonTX We can discuss Shinseki and the wait time scandal offline, because that’s a whole different convo. My point is: Your two premises that your starting with here are false. 1) The easiest way to get booted from the table is do what VSOs are doing now. 1/2
@AlexHortonTX As far as I’ve seen, all of the VSOs acknowledged SecVA screwed up in statements and responses to reporters. The question being asked today: is VA better or worse if Shulkin gets fired? The plain as day answer: Far, far worse.
@AlexHortonTX Alex, I know you’re invested because you broke the travel story — but if you think that VSOs are fighting here to maintain a seat at the table, I don’t think you’re paying attention to the whole picture.

Excellent work by @Reinlwapo, @emily_wax and @jdawsey1 here. This is, I hope, going to result in changes to the way that this Administration is clearly undermining the advise and consent privileges of congress.
This is an outrageous situation and the sabotage of the VA should be strongly condemned across party lines. This isn't "draining the swamp." It's filling it up with poisonous snakes.
@SecShulkin rightfully resists the unconstitutional takeover of the nation's second largest federal agency. Then the entitled rich guy (who reports to no one at VA, but has a VA position?) then recommends to the White House that Shulkin be fired so that they can insert a puppet.
Then the @WhiteHouse inserts a lobbyist and millionaire friend (Jake Leinenkugel) who has no background in healthcare into the Secretary's office and gives this guy the impression that he's actually the one leading @DeptVetAffairs policy.
This is a BIG DEAL. The @SecShulkin was confirmed by the US Senate as part of the Constitution's checks and balances. @VAChair and @SVACDems strongly approved, along with every major Veteran organization and the entire Senate voted in favor of Shulkin.
#BREAKING: Washington Post uncovers secret plan to oust VA Secretary Shulkin by Trump's "White House spies." https://t.co/nlH3jn04qs
@iAmTheWarax @SecShulkin I just spent all of last semester in an upper-level course on Bureaucracy and privatization. I can sum up countless hours of research (outside of my job as a veteran advocate) with this: It takes a lot of time and effort to build a house. It takes no time at all to burn it down.
@iAmTheWarax @SecShulkin My point is that this is not a hypothetical scenario that's just a fruitless exercise to explore. This is reality. Shulkin going means a replacement comes in, and likely one with an agenda that's going to make everyone WISH the biggest problem was a trip to Europe.
@iAmTheWarax @SecShulkin I'm not here to defend Shulkin's mistakes. I think the argument that he's lost the moral high ground to reform VA does carry merit (though I'm not entirely convinced). But all things being as they are... let's say he gets the boot. Then what? Do you see another viable leader?
@dohertytjp @artayyeb @LeoShane @SecShulkin @DeptVetAffairs While I appreciate the complement, I am nowhere near qualified to run an organization anywhere near that. On a serious note: I fear there are a lot of unqualified folks who would be tapped if Shulkin left, and they’d gladly accept those positions to the detriment of all veterans.
@artayyeb @dohertytjp @LeoShane @SecShulkin @DeptVetAffairs 3 years, unless the WH has some... changes.
When the military can't use you -- your value to them ceases. I'm sure that most troops with clear, visible wounds will get taken care of. But invisible injuries -- whether they be mental, or something like common knees/back/TBI... commanders will screw them over.
History has a habit of repeating itself. After the surge into Iraq was over, tons of wounded, injured and ill veterans were kicked out without benefits for trumped up "misconduct" or "failure to adapt" type phony discharges.
...discharge? The results of this policy will impact veterans, DoD appeals, and the VA for *decades* to come. We're looking at potentially tens of thousands of veterans getting shuffled out of the military very quickly, through no fault of their own.
