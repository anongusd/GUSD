Initial tests were conducted to assess the anomalous gyro. It is properly tracking movement, but the rates are consistently too high, exceeding the limit that it can report small movements. More tests and analysis to come. For a full update: https://t.co/yVAth8RGO6
Built with multiple redundancies, Hubble had six new gyros installed during Servicing Mission-4 in 2009.  Hubble usually uses three gyros at a time for maximum efficiency, but can continue to make scientific observations with even just one gyro.
The Hubble team is working to resume science after Hubble entered safe mode due to 1 of 3 gyros failing.  Analysis and testing on the backup gyro are ongoing to determine why it is not performing as expected.  For more info: https://t.co/T72X4pjLPI
On Friday, the Hubble Space Telescope went into safe mode due to a failed gyro – used to keep the telescope precisely pointed for long periods. Mission experts are taking steps to return Hubble to great science. More updates will follow.

In a new observing campaign, Hubble uses 6 massive clusters as "natural telescopes" to look for amplified images of galaxies and supernovas that are so distant and faint that they could not be photographed without a phenomenon called gravitational lensing: https://t.co/9usREwGHgl https://t.co/2sbJp9XwYO
@Simon0Marner Astronomers came up with the name “planetary nebula” over 200 years ago because these objects resembled round planets when viewed through telescopes of the time. Today, though, we know that not all planetary nebulas are round! For more info: https://t.co/D3nt7Tda4p

Happy #PiDay! March 14th represented in numbers is 3.14, which are the first three numbers in the pi constant. Pi is a mathematical constant used to define the ratio of a circle's circumference to its diameter. Hubble observes circular objects every day, like galaxy NGC 7049: https://t.co/SVE3h8lsXk
Though once big enough to swallow three Earths with room to spare, Jupiter's Great Red Spot has been shrinking for a century and a half. Nobody is sure how long the storm will continue to contract or whether it will disappear altogether: https://t.co/xTir72omSI https://t.co/52JkTgS26R
About 1 in 1,000 massive galaxies is expected to be a relic galaxy, like NGC 1277, researchers say. They were not surprised to find it, but simply consider that it was in the right place at the right time to evolve — or rather not evolve — the way it did: https://t.co/2Y3HBqwSDD https://t.co/Lc0TIw3RAu

Thanks to Hubble, we now know that there are hundreds of Billions of other Galaxies in the universe.
@astraughnomer favorite Hubble image is the Hubble Ultra Deep Field.
it would take about 100 thousand year for that light to reach across the galaxy.
If you could stand on a planet, at one end of the Milky Way &amp; shine a flashlight to the other end...
Our Milky Way Galaxy contains a couple of hundred billion stars.

@kylemorris97 @MathMathFractal Also, it's worth noting that Hubble is 25 years old - the technology for data transmission is dated.
@kylemorris97 @MathMathFractal I'll look into this a bit more for you; the initial data shared was provided by Frank Cepollina.
