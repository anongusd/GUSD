Hillary Clinton calling young black men "superpredators" and David Duke being a Democrat and KKK grand wizard came long after "our past."

Putting an "R" by your name doesn't make you @republican. #DavidDuke is no republican. This is what primaries are for. #LAsen
Jim Crow and the KKK were Democratic Party policies. That's the party David Duke joined and was elected on--not the @GOP. #LAsen
If Democrats play a gotcha game, trying to tie David Duke around Republicans' neck, then Duke and the KKK's Democratic past is fair game.
Still, David Duke today represents himself and himself alone. #LAsen voters will rightly reject him. He's no conservative, republican.
David Duke is a blast from the past, reminding us that when he was a Grand Wizard of the KKK, he honored the roots of the Democratic Party.
The KKK was started, in part, to keep blacks and republicans from voting. It was the racist, terrorist-wing of the Democratic Party. #LAsen
