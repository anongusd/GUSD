CFPB‚Äôs ‚Äúdouble the data‚Äù rule is not just ineffective and costly, it also poses a threat to Americans‚Äô privacy and data security. We must pass #HMDAA to give relief to Main Street banks and credit unions in Minnesota and across the country.
Due to the increased cost of compliance with the CFPB‚Äôs ‚Äúdouble the data‚Äù rule ‚Äì an estimated additional $326 million - many small banks in Minnesota are reconsidering their ability to continue to make mortgages and other covered loans. #HMDAA
Over the years the 1975 Home Mortgage Disclosure Act has expanded away from its original intent (to eliminate discriminatory lending). Dodd-Frank‚Äôs CFPB created a rule in 2015 to move it even further - requiring more than DOUBLE the data required to be reported. #HMDAA

The time has come to put healthcare back in the hands of the American people by allowing them to choose their own doctors and coverage.
In MN, Blue Cross Blue Shield suffered major losses as a result of Obamacare‚Äôs failures, forcing them to drop individual plans.
As a result of these rising costs, many families have opted to go uninsured, rather than pay for these skyrocketing costs.
In MN alone, premiums have increased nearly 67% for 2017. Minnesotan families cannot, and should not, have to shoulder those costs.
.@POTUS was at the Capitol today in a last ditch effort to save Obamacare. But I can think of a few major reasons why it MUST be repealed‚Ä¶
