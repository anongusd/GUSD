@BuzzFeedNews Cry me a river. Can't handle the truth. Pick up a history book and you will see the truth in this. He'll pick up a Demorats year book even.
@brithume She was looking for an advantage. Some people have no shame.
@RepSwalwell @HouseIntel Your name and the word intelligence should not be anywhere close to each other.
@CBSNews Apologizes again. And most likely will have to apologise many more times ,as more forms will probably come out.
@KassyDillon She is a child that wants to burn this country down. I don't think her parents hugged her enough.
@SheriffClarke @realDonaldTrump Moves and counter moves. Know one does it better.
@CBSNews @SenJeffMerkley This guy is out his mind. Trump is not the one supporting baby killings.
@SenJohnKennedy @rollcall I wish you were my senator instead of Sheridan Brown. I feel sorry for my state.
@GovMikeHuckabee @IngrahamAngle @POTUS @realDonaldTrump We finally have a POTUS that speaks truth. Best in my 43 years of life.
