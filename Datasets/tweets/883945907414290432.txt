Earlier it was being reported that #OIC condemned Indian brutality in #Kashmir.  @SMQureshiPTI also talked about it. However, no such clause is found in the final resolutions. Is the declaration modified on any influence? @HamidMirPAK @TalatHussain12 https://t.co/va7VZqO1t6
Where are those images? The one displayed with this news doesn’t show destruction of any camp/training Centre. #India makes a failed attempt to prove that IAF destroyed #JeM camp and shot down #F16. @indiatoday https://t.co/nuCZv12Gs0
Demand of Nobel Prize for @ImranKhanPTI brought our PM on the same caliber that of @narendramodi. We are still on the risk of #NuclearWar and the ruling party is playing at the cost of national security. NA should give @PTIofficial a shut up call. @BBhuttoZardari @MaryamNSharif https://t.co/6G8TUD1tb8
Unfortunately political parties, on both sides, are capitalizing on a conflict between two #NuclearStates. @narendramodi put region in jeopardy for political scoring and @ImranKhanPTI sidelined Pakistan’s #NationalSecurity by releasing IAF pilot for improving his personal image.
A fake news being propagated by India about shooting down of Pakistani #F16 and lynching of Pakistani Wing Commander by mob. @OfficialDGISPR should come forward and reject the concerned claims to clear the air. https://t.co/TAf9YbcLt4
2/2: 		The quoted statement of US @DeptofDefense shows US firm belief that Pakistan didn’t use F-16 aircraft in recent defensive air operation against Indian aggression. @OfficialDGISPR @IndiaToday @HamidMirPAK @MichaelKugelman https://t.co/UQsO4t306Q
“But before making any judgement or arriving at any conclusion, it needs to establish some facts on the ground, if there has been any violation by Pakistan to the F-16 end-user agreement it signed by the United States.”  https://t.co/JEGvxNXoKT via @indiatoday
2/2 	TURNING POINT		The #BJP was totally humiliated when we shot IAF aircrafts but they are pulling things back after @ImranKhanPTI’s defensive speech and release of captured #IAFPilot. There are different protocols for War time speeches Mr PM. https://t.co/9kfgKY0g7B
Releasing IAF pilot so early was a mistake. Such “good gestures” are not practiced so early when wars are in progress. It’s not a victory that we shot down two planes. The real victory would be if we fail @narendramodi’s attempts to win next election. https://t.co/SEs5kDg7Ya
From their words to their policies @PTIofficial is a “national integration risk” for Pakistan. In this moment of War, when entire Pakistan is one and united, how @fawadchaudhry can chose such poor words which can affect our national harmony? https://t.co/P2wsFaigjz
Neither international media nor any reputable analyst is confirming about Indian claims of killing 300 terrorists in IAF raid or shooting down F-16. Despite joint press conf by three services the int’l media is reluctant to confirm the Indian claim. @HamidMirPAK @OfficialDGISPR https://t.co/sDvr5KJOls
Neither any Pakistani F-16 went down nor Indian pilot is being released under Geneva Convention. Since India is badly humiliated therefore it wants a face saving. @HamidMirPAK @Mushahid @asmashirazi @fawadchaudhry @OfficialDGISPR @htTweets https://t.co/Kycp4uRJtQ
This is #BJP/Indian confession that @narendramodi triggered a war between two #nuclear states and put entire region in jeopardy just for the sake of edge in the upcoming elections. @HamidMirPAK @Mushahid https://t.co/bPgGD9flmh
PM @ImranKhanPTI, former President @AAliZardari, former PM #NawazSharif, ex-COAS #RaheelSharif and COAS use their maximum influence on Islamic World to cancel the OIC invitation to #Indian FM @SushmaSwaraj. @MaryamNSharif @BBhuttoZardari @OfficialDGISPR #IndiaNotAcceptableInOIC
2/2 In Strategic Studies and International Relations terminologies, aborting a military adventure following effective counter-response by adversary, is called defeat, retreat or surrender not a #SurgicalStrike.  @OfficialDGISPR @ImranKhanPTI @HamidMirPAK @BBhuttoZardari https://t.co/8RM2gblPdd
5th largest def budget of $60b, equipped with US, Russian and Israeli jets, India aborted its air misadventure by just intruding 4 miles into AJ&amp;K following prompt and effective response of PAK airforce. Still fooling its nation by calling it a #SurgicalStrike. @OfficialDGISPR
It seems a deliberate act. Shame on such journalism. @MaryamNSharif maintained her cool, ignored it and set an example of tolerance and patience. She knows why it all is happening with her. https://t.co/9HE9gjzYQf

Valiant speech by PM @ImranKhanPTI. PM has not only rejected baseless Indian allegations with logic and evidence but also warned India of retaliation in case of any aggression/war/conflict. #PakistanWantsPeaceAndStability #PakistanZindabad https://t.co/WVJqatTTF5
Strongly condemn the terrorist attacks in #Loralai and #Punjgur in which six FC personnels are martyred. These terrorist attacks can’t stop #Pakistan’s progress and development and its widening important role in the emerging regional and international scenario. @OfficialDGISPR
Very true. #Pakistan can’t afford to antagonize international community especially big powers and neighbors. It can result in our isolation. https://t.co/4fAUhzzEsh
PM @ImranKhanPTI neither is briefed nor has yet demanded any briefing from military command on the situation being developed after #PulwamaTerrorAttack. We are so preoccupied with arrangements for #MBS visit that we don’t even bother to surveil the situation of national security.
Side effects of Bollywood movies 😂 https://t.co/prXzUywCiA
There are certain loopholes in Indian defense system and intelligence. These loopholes result terrorist attacks and explosions in the past too. But rather addressing these weaknesses India always allege its neighbors for such attacks which is unjustified. @OfficialDGISPR https://t.co/keFcinr3QD
It seems that the #US doesn’t trust #Pakistan it therefore wants to bring his own ally #MBS as guarantor of US-Taliban Peace Talks. Due to huge #Saudi loans and investments Pakistan wouldn’t be able to move pawns in #Afghanistan bypassing US and KSA. https://t.co/npvtFDNYhb
آج سعودی ولی احد کی ناراضگی کی وجہہ سے ہم شیعہ مسلمانو کے خلاف کاروائی کر رہے ہیں, کل چین کی مسلم دشمن پالیسیز کے خلاف احتجاج کا حق بھی چھن جایگا. @ImranKhanPTI  نے سچ کہا تھا “کے جو آپکو پیسے دیتا ہے وو پھر آپکی آزادی چھین لیتا ہے , آپکو اپنا غلام بنا دیتا ہے” @ShireenMazari1
It’s too early to mention #Pakistan. Let the investigations be completed. #India has loopholes in its defense system, intelligence and dealing with people of #Kashmir which cost India similar attacks in the past. South Asian people are hopeful of US role for peace. https://t.co/OO0KI5LIF4
India is the only country in the World which put allegations on neighbors following any terrorist act on its soil without even waiting for the preliminary investigations. India must examine its Kashmir atrocities and loopholes within its defense system first. #StopBlamingPakistan
Shia Muslims are 40% of Pakistan’s total population. They are citizens of Pakistan and pay taxes which contribute in country’s revenue and development. This is how @PTIofficial Interior Ministry headed by PM @ImranKhanPTI treats Pakistani citizens. @HamidMirPAK @TalatHussain12 https://t.co/UmqiagNI9s
@BBhuttoZardari and CM @MuradAliShahPPP must order to investigate the allegations of violation of merit against #SPSC Member Saindad Solangi. Selection of four of Solangi’s blood relatives in SPSC competitive exams is widely seen suspiciously and #SindhGovt is being criticized.
It is really tragic and painful. The killings of Pashtun labourers condemned throughout Sindh. @BBhuttoZardari and CM @MuradAliShahPPP must foil this conspiracy through strict action against culprits. #ArrestKillersOfPashtunLabourers #LongLiveSindhiPashtunBrotherhood https://t.co/RbXGZ5d2VZ

2/2: A conspiracy against ‘Sindhi-Pashtun Brotherhood’ is conspiracy against #Sindh, #KP and #Pakistan. Culprits used #ShaheedBB’s town. @BBhuttoZardari and @MuradAliShahPPP must foil conspiracy by ordering the arrest of killers within 24 hours. #ArrestKilkersOfPashtuns https://t.co/mRWzRHdLHj

PTI candidates’ objection on re-counting of votes on various constituencies is contradiction of @ImranKhanPTI victory speech where he promised to other parties that PTI would facilitate any investigation on election results. First promise/pledge broken in first two days.
Only three hours since the start of voting process and we have witnessed bomb blasts, bullet firing, cracker blasts in various parts of the country. More than 10 people are reported to be martyred (figure still to be verified) and many injured.
Peace loving people have opened fire on poling camps of PPP (a banned terrorist party) in Larkana and Sanghar. Many PPP workers are injured - some of them are in serious condition.
2008 General Elections were comparatively fair, 2013 Elections were partially rigged while General Elections 2018 seems to be “engineered” and would be one of the “worst remembered” elections of Pakistan’s political history.
