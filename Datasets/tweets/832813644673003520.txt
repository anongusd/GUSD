@maslowsflawed @SenRickScott @tedcruz @SenTedCruz He was governor for two terms and just barely became senator (retired a senator that was there for 18 years!) and won’t be up for re-election til 2024. Get your facts straight next time.
@MuppetMastery @SenRickScott @SenTedCruz Who would @SenRickScott be gone? He just got in and retired a career politician who was there for 18 years! @SenTedCruz is only on his second term. @LindseyGrahamSC will be running for a fourth term and to be honest, I think he does a great job but four terms is too long.
@frankbklynboca @SenRickScott @SenTedCruz He retired a senator who was there for 18 years!
@frankbklynboca @SenRickScott @SenTedCruz Two terms as governor is a usual amount of terms for a governor. He just barely got in the senate.

@LisaM3732 @AryaResists Sorry, I thought you were being literal.
@AryaResists @LisaM3732 I wouldn’t be willing to trade lives with anybody. I’ve worked hard to get where I am and it’s my life tailored for me.
@LisaM3732 @AryaResists Well I love them in the sense of them being friends.

@LisaM3732 @AryaResists Like love as in dating love or love as in the way I love my friends?
@LisaM3732 @AryaResists Can’t I just not see race and see everyone as equals?
@LisaM3732 @AryaResists Which part is the crappy part?
@LisaM3732 @AryaResists There’s a difference between making a stupid decision and being racist. Also, I do my best to socialize with anyone no matter who.
@kenya56246302 @LisaM3732 @AryaResists Uhhhh what?
@LisaM3732 @AryaResists They just think the left makes it to be a bigger deal than it is. I agree racism is wrong, I just wish I’d stop being told 24/7 I have white privilege and therefore my point is false.
@LisaM3732 @AryaResists Most my non-white friends either don’t care about racism and don’t think it’s a very big problem or they think it’s a problem but every view should be validated.
@LisaM3732 @AryaResists Look, I don’t think Meadows made the best decision but I once tried to discuss BLM and even when I said valid, factual statements they were invalidated because I’m white.
@LisaM3732 @AryaResists Yes, racism is wrong. But I believe someone’s race shouldn’t keep them from making a valid point
@LisaM3732 @AryaResists How do I make my opinions on race valid then? How do I not have my view invalidated?
@LisaM3732 @AryaResists It’s because whenever we try to comment on race it’s white privilege and therefore invalid. Then we counteract that by being in an African American who believes the same thing. How do we illustrate our view without being called racist then?

@Thalia_Nyx @joshua_harder Yeah at the forest fires are really the fault of Jerry Brown and PG&amp;E although Trump should’ve given more federal aid to wash the fires I will admit
@Thalia_Nyx @joshua_harder Also if the independent commission that drives the Lions was actually independent instead of gerrymandering the state and Republicans would hold at least 1/4 of the congressional seats in California
@Thalia_Nyx @joshua_harder The California GOP is screwed up for a long reasons and that and there’s somebody on the inside it’s quite honestly disgusting and then one time I went about the Democratic inside and I got disgusted but they’re smart they know what they’re doing.
@Thalia_Nyx @joshua_harder Have you seen the North Carolina polls?
@Thalia_Nyx @joshua_harder I could definitely see Cheryl Brown winning but honestly I don’t even think he’s going to run But if he does Ronnie he will not win the primary

@Thalia_Nyx @joshua_harder Who do you think can beat Trump in 2020 of them?
@Thalia_Nyx @joshua_harder I don’t know whether or not Trump will be in office by 2020 but let’s not debate out let’s discuss his reelection odds
@Thalia_Nyx @joshua_harder It all depends on who runs on who the candidates are it also depends on how the new Democrats do
@Thalia_Nyx @joshua_harder By the way my words are going to be misspelled right now at times because I am currently working in Philly busy however I like conversing with you and I would like to thank you for not calling me names and being respectful
@Thalia_Nyx @joshua_harder Actually generation Z is coming in to replace millennial’s can you should probably read about their political views because it’s cording to C-SPAN they are the most conservative since the great generation
@Thalia_Nyx @joshua_harder I actually work with the GOP in California and let me tell you there is a lot of messed up stuff with the GOP in California and they screwed themselves over and a lot of representatives he went down never met with their constituents and just did a terrible job
@Thalia_Nyx @joshua_harder This is an about demographics this is about history and if you want to see the future look into the past can you look into the past you’ll see the future says Trump will be reelected in 2022 is going to be a bad year for Republicans and 2024 will be a blowout for Democrats
@Thalia_Nyx @joshua_harder And not Everywoman has the same views and beliefs and women have been awake for a very long time fact without them none of us would exist and they are the greatest thing God has ever created. The majority of women in 2010 and 2014 voted for Republicans.
@Thalia_Nyx @joshua_harder People always talk about the difference between women and men in voting look at single woman in single man versus married woman and man that’s where the big difference in voting is my sister and my mother both support trump a lot.
@Thalia_Nyx @joshua_harder The Republican Party will continue to exist and Depolarization will likely get worse both parties will continue to exist in the midterms will always be bad for the party in power except in very rare cases such as 2002 and that was because of Bush’s response to 9/11
@Thalia_Nyx @joshua_harder Remember that Trump got more Hispanic and Latino vote than any Republican presidential candidate in decades same thing with the African American vote if you were banking on demographics to give you a win you are going to lose
@Thalia_Nyx @joshua_harder If demographics actually worked as a strategy in Clinton would’ve killed Trump in 2016 because at that time they were more African-Americans than 2008 and 2012 but one instance happens is that the more groups will be becoming more Republican.
@Thalia_Nyx @joshua_harder What about 2014 then? Midterms are almost always bad for the party in power. Incumbent presidents are usually re-elected by a stronger margin. Also, demographics is a terrible strategy. The country is always changing but so are the views of many people.
@Thalia_Nyx @joshua_harder Do you remember 2010?

@Krispikritters @jv_hicks @pollsofpolitics @POTUS @SpeakerPelosi @SenSchumer Babies have been getting separated since Clinton's executive order in 1993. The big goal of the tax cuts was the corporate tax rate. The big businesses have the money to find tax code loopholes and the small businesses don't. So small businesses get stuck with corporate rate.
@Krispikritters @jv_hicks @pollsofpolitics @POTUS @SpeakerPelosi @SenSchumer You need sixty senate votes to approve the 5 billion dollar wall the republican house passed. Dems refused to give us the 9 votes we needed. Because of how bare a majority we had in the senate we'd have to compromise with democrats anyway.

@agustuspinel Don't you also think Beto O'Rourke will win in Texas?
@sliver_slipper @PredictIt True, however I find that extremely unlikely and primary turnout really doesn't mean too much. It's important and helps with the process but if primary turnout decided elections then @SherrodBrown would be headed for a loss instead of a double-digit win.
@JakobDWebster @PredictIt One of the few districts I consider a pure toss-up
Wendy will not be able to win as she will turn off the moderates (many of whom voted Trump because of SCOTUS) and the edge given to Democrats this year will solidly give Incumbent Tom O'Halleran one more term in the House. Therefore, Democrat remaining Democrat (AZ-01)	@PredictIt
Even though O'Halleran is popular he could still lose if he was up against an extremely strong candidate. Sadly for Republicans that is not the case. They nominated Wendy Rogers who called her primary opponent (a state senator) a pedophile. While she is very trump-ian	@PredictIt
Day 1 of the House Analysis: @PredictIt AZ-01 Current: D	Midterm Prediction: D	Incumbent Tom O'Halleran won by 7.3% in a district Trump won by 1.1%, while that should point to some competitiveness I can tell you... It's not. Tom is a former Republican and comes off very moderate.
29 days til Election Day in that time I will be going through 47 different competitive house seats and giving my take on them. Each day will include several tweets discussing one or two house races, my prediction, data, etc. @PredictIt @rainbow_jeremy_ @SharkoRubio
@agustuspinel Then what's your number prediction?

@StopLordDampnut What powers of the President do you believe we should outsource? POTUS does a lot more than most people realize. Just look at any President before they took office and after they leave, they look like they aged thirty something years when actually they just aged eight years.

@LisaM3732 @real_farmacist @FBI If he did it and lied under oath he is not fit for SCOTUS
@LisaM3732 @real_farmacist @FBI Yes.
@LisaM3732 @real_farmacist @FBI Yes but polygraphs aren’t reliable at all. If Kavanaugh is the serial liar you believe he is he should pass with flying colors and it won’t make a difference.

@dubree_charito @winstonCovfefe They’re not stupid. They just believe differently from us and are so consumed with hatred over 2016 that they will do everything to keep conservatives from a victory.
@LisaM3732 @real_farmacist I’d never do that. Never. My sister and mother and father taught me well. However if I was at the pinnacle of my career and someone accused me of assault (which threatens to destroy everything I’ve worked toward) I would like people to believe I’m innocent.

@LisaM3732 @real_farmacist I never said Ford didn't lose things. I feel bad for her to be honest. I feel bad for her because of how she has been used by the democrats (especially by Feinstein). I believe in presumption of innocence and hope the 1-week investigation will clear things up.

@LisaM3732 @real_farmacist He's my senator and I've spoken with him before. I also spoke with Governor Ducey after he announced Kyl. SCOTUS definitely did have a part to do with it but the other candidates didn't have the experience, praise from McCain and would have been more further right.
@LisaM3732 @real_farmacist His family has received death threats, he likely lost his job at harvard, won't be able to coach his daughter's basketball team anymore and has had a reputation he spent 53 years building thrown in the trash.
@LisaM3732 @real_farmacist Jon Kyl was picked because he was a former US Senator, highly respected by John McCain and was a good voice for AZ in the Senate. Kyl hasn't announced how he'll vote though and he was pretty moderate. And McConnell will do what McConnell does

@BlueRobotDesign @rspeters84107 @TeamDean @DeanHeller If the democrats take the senate then deadlock will be the only thing. Compromise won't exist. Also have you looked at the Senate map? I'm a data guru and it's not gonna happen.
@LisaM3732 @real_farmacist And what if he had been quiet, calm and reserved like the FOX News interview?
@BlueRobotDesign @rspeters84107 @TeamDean @DeanHeller Heller actually only votes with Trump around 82% of the time (similar to Susan Collins) and compromise is a huge part of being in Congress. Rosen obviously hasn't understood how it works or how to work with others and putting her in the Senate would only cause more deadlock.
@LisaM3732 @real_farmacist You don’t think he could be innocent at all?
@LisaM3732 @real_farmacist What has he done that’s been proven? If I accuse someone of rape should we automatically assume their guilty and let them lose everything or should we instead assume innocence until proven guilty and not destroy someone’s life?

@StopLordDampnut @treasonstickers What it means is those specific people switched their political views, not necessarily that the parties switched. The parties definitely changed but they didn’t switch and republicans don’t hate black people.
@StopLordDampnut @treasonstickers Democrat senate majority leader (2000). https://t.co/gpciRr36A5
@StopLordDampnut @treasonstickers Out of over 600.
@StopLordDampnut @treasonstickers One of the few. Over 600 Democrats were affiliated with racist organizations that held office, barely 20 switched parties. One was even senate majority leader in 2000 (Robert Byrd).

@LisaM3732 My mistake. She said he jumped on top giving her the opportunity to escape. I read it wrong.
@LisaM3732 No he wasn’t. He was impeached by the house but not the senate. It was a huge failure by republicans and was a stupid thing to do. Clinton was not fully impeached though.
@LisaM3732 Lie detectors don’t work. You can easily pass one if you just remain calm.

@rebeccadiserio @Abomination1349 @MissMarple2 @ThomasWictor @realDonaldTrump @LisaM3732 should this woman be believed as much as the accuser? Both are trying to discredit a person
@LisaM3732 I mean he can testify under oath. I’m not sure about the rest, but the vote shouldn’t be postponed unless we get credible evidence.
@LisaM3732 I thought Franken stepped down way too quickly and we should’ve waited for an investigation before we destroyed another man’s career. There was a photo though (so that’s some evidence) but I haven’t seen any factual evidence convicting Kavanaugh.
@LisaM3732 Show me some factual evidence instead of people saying something and then I’ll consider destroying a man’s career
@LisaM3732 What if your son was accused? And I’d believe her, but this woman isn’t my daughter or related to me and she’s doing it to destroy someone’s possible scotus confirmation. Also, https://t.co/Y3lQo6AB5b

@krassenstein @StopLordDampnut @realDonaldTrump A whole lot of accused witches pleaded guilty in Salem.
@LisaM3732 @scrappy406 @SenatorTimScott Well we have a lower population of African Americans than white. Also, it matters who runs... why should race or gender be an important factor when deciding who you want to represent you. It should be about beliefs and qualifications instead.
@LisaM3732 @scrappy406 @SenatorTimScott Well who’s to say anyone is privileged or isn’t privileged. The only privilege is America privilege and that comes from being born in the land of opportunity
@LisaM3732 @scrappy406 @SenatorTimScott Slavery happened but we don’t need to let it effect our lives today. People can take charge of their own lives and bring in America gives them a plethora of opportunities
@LisaM3732 @scrappy406 @SenatorTimScott I went and spoke to people who came from and inner city but I did notice a racial disparity. After my speech though several came up and hugged me and told me I was right. One was crying.
@LisaM3732 @scrappy406 @SenatorTimScott I actually just did that the other day.
@LisaM3732 @scrappy406 It’s not about skin color. It’s about the situation you’re born into. Look at @SenatorTimScott he was raised in poverty by a single mother, climbed himself out and now sits in one of the highest legislative bodies in the country

@jakalpimp @stucam7771 Trickle down was invented by democrats to describe republican economic policies. It has never been actuslly proposed and no sane person has ever proposed that person policy. Republicans believe in supply side economics.
@LisaM3732 I’d love to read it when I am old enough
@LisaM3732 Not in mine. I’d love to read your book sometime
@LisaM3732 He was at the time a senator and represented my state.
@LisaM3732 I would love to...	I’d tell them how awful they are and lots of other colorful things
@LisaM3732 He still represents them even if he doesn’t vote. And if you’re gonna attack DeSantis over this you need to attack McCain too.
@LisaM3732 The people who voted for him probably want him to be governor.
@LisaM3732 😉 Me?	Also, McCain took pay even when he couldn’t work. Wish he hadn’t done that
@LisaM3732 Of course. But declining pay because you know you don’t deserve it is honorable.
@LisaM3732 @JoviGirl88 I don’t miss his policy whatsoever I also don’t miss his speeches. (I was never a big fan of his speeches, thought they were just okay).
@LisaM3732 Still, you have to give him some respect for this. I gave respect to Chris Coons for acting like an adult during the Pompeo confirmation even though I disagree with him politically on most issues
@LisaM3732 Agreed. Mr. DeSantis did something so many refuse to do and because of that my respect for him has shot up.

@JoviGirl88 @LisaM3732 I do not miss Obama whatsoever. Actually, correction: I do miss Obama’s ability to know when to shut up but that’s it
@LisaM3732 And DeSantis is one of the few people who realized he doesn’t deserve a paycheck. I think that is extremely honorable. Sanders should’ve done the same when he was running for POTUS
@StopLordDampnut @realDonaldTrump You can hate trump but the economy has improved significantly since Obama left office.
RT @PollackHunter: Government needs to stop giving more tax payer dollars to already over funded programs that’ve shown they cannot work.

@LisaM3732 I think he likes to play but he also likes the attention
@LisaM3732 No, I think he likes the attention. Also the millions of dollars he got from this Nike deal.
@LisaM3732 A company should want to avoid that. Unless you are specifically coming from that controversy.
@LisaM3732 Also I wouldn’t call Kaepernick an underdog considering he has the media, millions of dollars, and half the country on his side.
@LisaM3732 MLK stood for the flag and the anthem. True, controversy can be found in anything but people like Kaepernick are especially controversial and you should want to avoid that.
@LisaM3732 But conservatives would propel a brief increase in sales for Nike but after they would have lost a huge part of their business. It’s just bad business to associate with controversy. As a business you want everyone to buy your product no matter who
@LisaM3732 Kaepernick is especially controversial though. Imagine if Nike had gone with Trump instead of Kaepernick
@LisaM3732 Actually their approval was split in half by Gen-Z (18-21)
@LisaM3732 The overall thought though in my view is that companies should keep from associating themselves with any controversial figure. It just turns people off, you know?
@LisaM3732 Their favorability has been cut in half though
@LisaM3732 Their sales briefly went up 31%. Their stock went down 2.1%
@LisaM3732 Actually I think it hurt the cause much more than helped it.
@LisaM3732 What I’m trying to say is a larger point that he has the right and I have the right to disagree with it and think it is at the wrong time and the wrong place.
@LisaM3732 He has the freedom to protest I won’t say he doesn’t but I will say he shouldn’t. Just like Alex Jones has his right to speak but 95% of what he says, he shouldn’t say
@LisaM3732 Cause they’re forcing me to. Like a child who just has to have attention.
@LisaM3732 You’re not supposed to pay attention to the players during the anthem.
@LisaM3732 I’ve dealt with some terrible experiences with cops. Also, I overall don’t watch sports. Just not my thing. My family does though... they haven’t been watching the NFL lately
@LisaM3732 I think (at least in house and senate) we should switch to a 4-party system
@LisaM3732 I support the right to protest... on your own time. When I am working at my job I shouldn’t protest or support anything because I’m representing so much more than myself. Kaepernick can lead hundreds of protests outside of work and I’ll support his right but at work, he shouldn’t
@LisaM3732 I don’t support obstructionists of either side
@LisaM3732 Too bad both obstruct when the other is in power
@lister_lester @LisaM3732 @CNN @LiReHirsch Where did you learn this?
@LisaM3732 I had dinner there last week. It was good
@LisaM3732 Don’t we all have a choice though on who we’d like to give our business to? And I’ve never been a fan of Nike myself. The child labor BS and the fact I don’t think their products are that good. They lost business they didn’t have anyway. I’ve never liked them
@LisaM3732 Did In-N-Out lose your business when you found out they donated $25,000 to the California GOP?

@thepuffkinlives I agree Sen. McCain deserves to leave with honor but neither tried to amend their relationship or said a kind word to one another. I blame them both. McCain is actually famous for not letting things go but they both acted childish. Trump should be an adult at this moment though.
@thepuffkinlives McCain and Trump hated each other. It started with McCain saying Trump unleashed all the crazies then Trump retaliated by saying he’s not a war hero. I don’t agree with either but wish one of them had been an adult and apologized to the other and tried to amend the relationship.

@Ninajudy3221 @davidmweissman Honestly, I don’t want to get into debating the whole BLM movement and police brutality.
@Ninajudy3221 @davidmweissman What is the message they’re trying to send though?

@WillSchoech Do you realize the reason why Trump was elected? And don’t say racism or Russians. Do you realize how far democrats pushed America to the point that they elected a reality tv star?
@WillSchoech @davidmweissman I’m not gonna debate the BLM movement but if I work for AT&amp;T and in public while working the pledge is said and I kneel that says that AT&amp;T is okay with it and I represent the company. And again, the athletes can protest on their own time but they represent more than themselves.
@Ser_Nicholas @davidmweissman When you work for a company you represent that company. When you work with a team you represent that team. When you are in a state team in a professional sport you represent that state. Also, there are other jobs that have you do the same.
@davidmweissman What is your point then? Yes, protests can do great things but it’s inappropriate to protest at work, you can protest work but not at work.
@davidmweissman I wish they would stage their own protests on their own time. They have every right to an I would support that but it’s inappropriate to protest when you are representing so much more than yourself.
@davidmweissman You shouldn’t do that at your job though. You represent a lot more than just yourself at work and you can kneel on your own time but when you’re at work and representing much more than yourself, kneeling for the flag is not appropriate at all.

@MissFortuneDrag And how do you define sensible? Where do you get the right to call someone sensible or not?

@MissFortuneDrag Wow. I was interested in actuslly didcussing more with you but that statement was just horrible. Why don’t you just say that conservatives are incorrect? Calling somebody non-sensible because of their political beliefs is just wrong. There are many sensible people on both sides.
@MissFortuneDrag Also you probably know a lot more conservatives than you think. Many are scared to say they are because of how others (especially friends and family) will react and treat them.

@atallnut @senorrinhatch I’m not gonna do that.
@atallnut @senorrinhatch I respect anyone in that position because obviously they’re there for a reason and if the president succeeds we all succeed, no matter who it is. Trump isn’t a good person. We’ve known this for years. He still has the job and needs to serve it.
@atallnut @senorrinhatch 1. Hasn’t been proven. 	2. Let’s say he did, it’s wrong, he shouldn’t have done it, I wouldn’t do it.	3. I don’t respect trump as a person when it comes to his history with marriages and affairs. I do respect him as a president though.
@Forabetterus1 @senorrinhatch Agree to disagree. Thanks for being respectful.
@atallnut @senorrinhatch @MitchMcConell Which one? Mostly no but he’s made some good choices and some terrible choices. Please be more specific, thanks!
@atallnut @senorrinhatch Stormy Daniels doesn’t warrant a federal investigation. She’s a whore who has lost popularity and was kicked out of porn for being too old. So, she screamed about Trump and made herself popular. If he did do it, it was before he held office and shouldn’t keep him from his duties.
@atallnut @senorrinhatch Rosenstein, Mueller, And Comey have all stressed the fact that Trump himself is not under any sort of investigation.
@atallnut @senorrinhatch Yes
@Forabetterus1 @senorrinhatch I believe a woman should right to choose not to have a child as well... hence, don’t have sex (she should have the choice to have sex and therefore have or not have a child). I do think it should be available in the rare cases of rape, incest, and danger to the mother’s health.
@atallnut @senorrinhatch @MitchMcConell Democrats got rid of the filibuster years ago. I don’t like what Mitch McConnel did, but the president is the president and they need to be allowed to perform their duties.
@atallnut @senorrinhatch What would’ve been different? And Trump himself isn’t under investigation.
@atallnut @senorrinhatch How long? If he had it his way it wouldn’t end til he’s out of office. And Trump isn’t under investigation himself. Comey, Mueller, And Rosenstein have stressed this fact
@Forabetterus1 @senorrinhatch He didn’t say it will happen, he said it might. Actually I think it should go back to the states. Talk about lopsided courts Roe v Wade passed when there were 7 liberal justices all on the court.
@atallnut @senorrinhatch And? The people spoke on who got to nominate. Personally I think what they did was wrong and he should’ve been given an opportunity. But it is what it is and I hold the same belief that the POTUS needs to appoint a nominee and allow them to go through the Senate.
@Forabetterus1 @senorrinhatch I didn’t say that, I’m excited to see who his nominee is. However, from 1930-1970 Democrats had a staggering majority in SCOTUS and passed whatever they wished. Since then the court hasn’t swung the opposite way, maybe it’s time to right some wrongs and allow a new direction.
@atallnut @senorrinhatch If we confirm a successor to Kennedg before midterms we will have directly replicated what they did eight years ago.

@luisa_tasayco @senorrinhatch No, Trump’s executive order did that. Keep in mind Obama issued a similar executive order ending family separations and it was overturned by the 9th circuit court of appeals. A very liberal court.

@StopLordDampnut @BonnieOdell12 @realamericadrew @realDonaldTrump @NVGOP @POTUS If you eliminate the republican from the ballot you cancel all republican representation in the state. I’m just saying that it’s wrong.
@StopLordDampnut @CollinRugg More articles or not? I can pull up all sorts of other media sources. I apologize for assuming what media you might be akin to, that was wrong of me, and I am sorry.
@StopLordDampnut @BonnieOdell12 @realamericadrew @realDonaldTrump @NVGOP @POTUS Look, canceling representation for your own political gain is wrong. Hence, why I actually like the new Pennsylvania map because it accurately represents the state (something I disagree with Trump and many republicans on).
@StopLordDampnut @CollinRugg I know that Snopes is a particular favorite of the anti trumpers. One of my closest friends is a Bernie intern and he really likes Snopes so I thought you might too. Want me to send more articles?
@StopLordDampnut @BonnieOdell12 @realamericadrew @realDonaldTrump @NVGOP @POTUS Nah, they prefer to obey the Constitution instead of twist it to fit their agenda
@BonnieOdell12 @StopLordDampnut @realamericadrew @realDonaldTrump @NVGOP @POTUS How is Trump a dictator?
@StopLordDampnut @CollinRugg Snopes is a left leaning website so you might think it’s reliable, I don’t but if I send you some of the articles I read you’ll say they’re bias.	https://t.co/XPgNF8iQsl
@StopLordDampnut @BonnieOdell12 @realamericadrew @realDonaldTrump @NVGOP @POTUS They’re not trying to pass laws to do it, unlike Delaware.
@StopLordDampnut @BonnieOdell12 @realamericadrew @realDonaldTrump @NVGOP @POTUS They’re not stupid enough to exclude Presidential nominees.
@StopLordDampnut @JustinCaseUSA1 @realamericadrew @realDonaldTrump @NVGOP @POTUS Sorry I like to wait for information and facts instead of taking 100% truth to everything I see and hear. Just like that TIME magazine cover hahahahaha
@StopLordDampnut @BonnieOdell12 @realamericadrew @realDonaldTrump @NVGOP @POTUS Lol, Delaware gets kicked out of the presidential race (that would be funny). Make it happen to California and New York too!
@StopLordDampnut @CollinRugg Not wrong at all.
@StopLordDampnut @JustinCaseUSA1 @realamericadrew @realDonaldTrump @NVGOP @POTUS Ask me, like I asked you. I could call you an anti trump sheep and your feed clearly illustrates that, but truly I have no clue, and won’t call you something so degrading unless you prove it to me myself.
@StopLordDampnut @BonnieOdell12 @realamericadrew @realDonaldTrump @NVGOP @POTUS There would be no Pres nominee in Delaware then, I’m just saying , if Trump gets excluded somehow, it will have ramifications and consequences for the democrats
@StopLordDampnut @CollinRugg Obama did separate more than Trump: true.	However, you are correct we don’t know if Democrats cared until trump, however, where was the outrage for the 25+ years that this policy was in effect?
@StopLordDampnut @JustinCaseUSA1 @realamericadrew @realDonaldTrump @NVGOP @POTUS I retweet things I like or find funny. My twitter feed isn’t who I am, why don’t you ask me about my views before you call me a sheep.
@StopLordDampnut @BonnieOdell12 @realamericadrew @realDonaldTrump @NVGOP @POTUS You said tax returns needed for 5 years. Meaning Bernie would be excluded too, actually, a lot of the possible Dem nominees would be excluded.
@Ksodeeya @PattyMurray You commented on a public social media site, what did you expect? Life isn’t an echo chamber and social media shouldn’t either. That causes extreme ignorance and stupidity on both sides.
@StopLordDampnut @JustinCaseUSA1 @realamericadrew @realDonaldTrump @NVGOP @POTUS Saw you added me to sheep. If you think I love Trump and agree blindly with everything about him you don’t know me at all.
@StopLordDampnut @hellcrapdamn @cheesetreats @realamericadrew @realDonaldTrump @NVGOP @POTUS My father has given his life to his kids and his work, Trump will make it past 2024 unless he’s assassinated or he gets an incurable disease.
@StopLordDampnut @BonnieOdell12 @realamericadrew @realDonaldTrump @NVGOP @POTUS Lol, butterfly ballot.
@StopLordDampnut @BonnieOdell12 @realamericadrew @realDonaldTrump @NVGOP @POTUS If Bernie’s the nominee then that could keep him from 270 cause he didn’t release his tax returns till 2016. 2020-2016 = 4
@hellcrapdamn @cheesetreats @realamericadrew @realDonaldTrump @NVGOP @POTUS Considering he’s 72 years old and looks as young as my 50 year old father, and doesn’t drink I’d say he’s pretty healthy.
@StopLordDampnut @BonnieOdell12 @realamericadrew @realDonaldTrump @NVGOP @POTUS According to ballotpedia the only qualifications are 35 or older, natural born citizen, and 14 years a citizen of the United States. He will be on the ballot in Delaware and even if he’s not, he’s not looking to win Delaware either.
@BonnieOdell12 @StopLordDampnut @realamericadrew @realDonaldTrump @NVGOP @POTUS I agree, we don’t need another disaster like the policies put in place by Obama, Bush, and Clinton.
@StopLordDampnut @BonnieOdell12 @realamericadrew @realDonaldTrump @NVGOP @POTUS Not for an office on the national level.
@expectingachg @realamericadrew @realDonaldTrump @NVGOP @POTUS Then let’s bet. $300 he makes it to the end of his first term.
@StopLordDampnut @BonnieOdell12 @realamericadrew @realDonaldTrump @NVGOP @POTUS Unless they change the United States Constitution he will.
@StopLordDampnut @JustinCaseUSA1 @realamericadrew @realDonaldTrump @NVGOP @POTUS @StopLordDampnut I’d like to discuss your views and see if we can both teach each other something. Dm me.
@expectingachg @realamericadrew @realDonaldTrump @NVGOP @POTUS He already filed for re election and  put your money where your mouth is... let’s bet on it!
@Turk182_JCP @realamericadrew @ronboutwell @realDonaldTrump @NVGOP @POTUS Glad to hear it!
@CFtrashtalkNat @realamericadrew @realDonaldTrump @NVGOP @POTUS Agreed. Also, same almost name
@GoldLiger0X @realamericadrew @realDonaldTrump @NVGOP @POTUS He already filed for re election
@BonnieOdell12 @realamericadrew @realDonaldTrump @NVGOP @POTUS Delaware doesn’t matter and the presidential election is based in the constitution. Unless we add a new amendment to the United States Constitution he will be on the ballot.
@TitoCordova8 @Keith_Peavy @realamericadrew @realDonaldTrump @NVGOP @POTUS I personally think Ben Shapiro should take over after Trump

@kenodawg1 @knsttucson You’re gonna accuse me of lying you’d better be ready to back it up!

@DenisaCasement @DemWrite I’d love to talk more but I’m exhausted and brain dead after all my trigonometry so we should talk tomorrow
@DenisaCasement @DemWrite It invalidates your political beliefs too and makes you seem like you can’t come up with your own thoughts. Whenever you argue politics, you better be able to debate using proof
@DenisaCasement @DemWrite Lol, Gorka isn’t as self destructive
@DenisaCasement @DemWrite My belief is keep politics and religions separate in policies and then I don’t have a problem with you supporting candidates that don’t make the moral decisions you’re religion mandates
@DenisaCasement @DemWrite Gorka I actually like quite a bit but Bannon on the other hand I didn’t even realize I retweeted. I don’t like Bannon at all
@DenisaCasement @DemWrite Please just tell me who I retweeted so if they are what you claim I can rescind the retweet
@DenisaCasement @DemWrite According to several people I’m a nazi actually 😂
@DenisaCasement @DemWrite I don’t know who you’re referring to, many people I retweet are supposed nazis
@DenisaCasement @DemWrite I’d love to keep talking with you but I just did 5 hours of trigonometry homework and I can’t think at all 😂
@DenisaCasement @DemWrite Who’s the nazi I retweeted?
@DenisaCasement @DemWrite I’ll agree as a person I’m not a huge fan, but consider the tax cuts pulled my brother out of debt and helped me pay my rent and not get evicted... I can vote for that
@LaFontaine70 @p_Johanna @CheriJacobus @KimKardashian No, I’m just proving that Hillary started the conspiracy
@Mark_Reina @GOPChairwoman The tax cuts pulled my brother out of debt and helped me pay my rent.
@DenisaCasement @DemWrite I could probably get you a meeting with her if you really wanted one (her being Martha)
@DenisaCasement @DemWrite I vote on policy as well but I bring the personal story into it because it’s very specific and has to do with my direct interactions with her. I disagree with her on policy though

@DenisaCasement @DemWrite McSally’s my Rep. She’s moderate &amp; fantastic. She won a AZ02 by 13 which went for Hillary by 5 cause of her great work! She was the first female fighter pilot. You should consider supporting her. Sinema and I share a personal backstory. Her hatred for me &amp; my family scares me.

@jaitkenmba @Sen_JoeManchin @realDonaldTrump Well you shouldn’t insult your boss like that honestly. Also the Iran deal and Paris climate accord were big disagreements
@DenisaCasement @DemWrite Why do you hope not?
@jaitkenmba @Sen_JoeManchin @realDonaldTrump He’s proven himself an ally so I think he’ll be in there for a while. Rex undermined and attacked trump too much and helped damage his agenda
@PopupProtests @hidehunt1 @godofthvnder @oceanmaniac @bkantha1 @kanyewest @FatKidDeals MSNBC joked about how they control what people believe. The media is a problem from both sides, but many trump supporters don’t watch Fox News. Fox has on average an audience of 10 million, yet over 60 million support the president
@jaitkenmba @Sen_JoeManchin I personally thought that comparing his credentials with others nominated would be a good way to determine if he was appropriate for the job, but if you want to just talk about Pompeo and not compare him then that’s fine with me

@Headerop1 Lol
@Headerop1 I just think the epa along with many other federal agencies and government branches need to have a lot of their power and force stripped away
@Headerop1 Also great catch in your profile photo. I caught three rainbow trout in  10 minutes once... that was cool
@Headerop1 Honestly I have some ethical problems with Pruitt but I’m so glad he’s head of the epa considering how much they’ve screwed this country. Also, don’t block people who you disagree with, rather you should embrace them and discuss

@jaitkenmba @Sen_JoeManchin I’m just saying they were two Secretary of State nominees. I didn’t want to bring anything else into it but you quoted Bush. How about we get back to the Pompeo, Rex, Hillary, Kerry discussion?
@PopupProtests @hidehunt1 @godofthvnder @oceanmaniac @bkantha1 @kanyewest @FatKidDeals I’ll agree that people can take it too far but calling someone a cult is a bit much 😂
@Gavinsplanet @CheriJacobus @Pura_Vida_Tica @KimKardashian Be kind bud. Have more respect toward your opponent, than they have toward you, that’s how you win.
@jaitkenmba @Sen_JoeManchin My father is a lawyer who has argued and won with the Supreme Court (8-1). I minor in law and read on it every day. However Clinton was caugh laughing about her victory, and while she did her job it was her happiness and humor she got from defending a client she knew was guilty.
@ack4wvu @GOPChairwoman @DebbieLesko @realDonaldTrump Compare the number of votes, instead of margins with 2016 presidential race. Not nearly as many republicans voted but a good amount of the previous dems voted
@LaFontaine70 @CheriJacobus @Gavinsplanet @Pura_Vida_Tica @KimKardashian Started by the Clinton campaign during her fight in the dem primary in 2008. As revealed by Donna Brazile
@jaitkenmba @Sen_JoeManchin I don’t care what George Bush or anyone else said. We can compare James Baker with Pompeo if you’d like but that’s the only relevance there
@ack4wvu @GOPChairwoman @DebbieLesko @realDonaldTrump Not a bad idea. In #AZ08 case though it was a moderate majority.
@jaitkenmba @Sen_JoeManchin What are those principles? And heck, Hillary worked as a lawyer and defended a rapist, should that have disqualified her?

@PopupProtests @hidehunt1 @godofthvnder @oceanmaniac @bkantha1 @kanyewest @FatKidDeals Let’s go back to what we were talking about... it’s not wrong for someone to support Kanye because he publicly supports the president. If Kanye attacked trump many dems would be in love with him. I like Kanye but I don’t think he knows what he’s talking about honestly
@jaitkenmba @Sen_JoeManchin I’m just saying that one thing shouldn’t disqualify him for that job entirely. A job that is really about being the aid to the president.
@HoodSocialist @retstogonow23 Shouldn’t we judge people by who they are rather than their skin color? Or is that ignorant?
@jaitkenmba @Sen_JoeManchin Pompeo didn’t personally advance the rumor that he did see action though. It was just believed and proven to be false but he didn’t brag about it or parade it around.
@PopupProtests @hidehunt1 @godofthvnder @oceanmaniac @bkantha1 @kanyewest @FatKidDeals It was that because of political belief. I’ve been through some horrible things not related to politics.
@ack4wvu @GOPChairwoman @DebbieLesko @realDonaldTrump I just see it as the district overall decided to reject... like Alabama rejected the extremism of Roy Moore
@CheriJacobus @jesterchris1 @vincent_riggin @kennithbinge @KimKardashian @YouTube Look at the photo I sent
@ack4wvu Says a lot about you. That’s a good thing.
@jaitkenmba @Sen_JoeManchin Have you never lied to get out of a big responsibility? Also, that was many years ago. Are you the same person from 10 years ago?

@CheriJacobus @jesterchris1 @vincent_riggin @kennithbinge @KimKardashian @YouTube He did denounce him
@ack4wvu @GOPChairwoman @DebbieLesko @realDonaldTrump True. That’s how I see an election though, even when it’s tight. The state or district or whatever rejects the losing candidate
@PopupProtests @hidehunt1 @godofthvnder @oceanmaniac @bkantha1 @kanyewest @FatKidDeals Have you gotten punched in the nose, called disgusting by a life long friend, lost a job over that single reason, had death threats sent to you and your family? Or how about failed by a teacher because of your views?
@COFightsBack @Sen_JoeManchin So mature.
@COFightsBack @Sen_JoeManchin Have you discussed this with a border patrol agent? Or how about my sister in law who works at a sanctuary building for illegal immigrants who have crossed the border and gives them food, clothing, housing, etc?

@COFightsBack @Sen_JoeManchin 1. You don’t know me. 	2. What’s the problem with my timeline?
@CheriJacobus @jesterchris1 @vincent_riggin @kennithbinge @KimKardashian And every single company in that time got a racial bias lawsuit thrown at it, it was a big group that was sued over it.
@CheriJacobus @jesterchris1 @vincent_riggin @kennithbinge @KimKardashian Did you not listen to anything I just said?
@PopupProtests @hidehunt1 @godofthvnder @oceanmaniac @bkantha1 @kanyewest @FatKidDeals I get that but considering how people talk about our president, especially celebrity elites, when one differs we want to say thank you &amp; show it. I used to work as an actor &amp; if I said anything about my political beliefs, I’d have to quit the job over threats &amp; personal attacks.
@DenisaCasement @DemWrite I think McSally will win the primary actually
@jaitkenmba @Sen_JoeManchin Like John Kerry and Hillary Clinton? Cause they were completely without flaws 😑
@COFightsBack @Sen_JoeManchin Yep. Cause I believe in God, didn’t say I’m a good person though.
@CheriJacobus @jesterchris1 @vincent_riggin @kennithbinge @KimKardashian Trump industries has a record of hiring some of the most diverse people out there. His companies are less white than many others! And why base so much off skin color, should we judge people by the content of their character and not the color of their skin?
@CheriJacobus @Gavinsplanet @Pura_Vida_Tica @KimKardashian How is he a white supremacist? I genuinely want to know
@ispeaksam @KimKardashian According to the left if you support trump you are mentally ill. I support trump and have triumphed in academics and school, it really pisses me off how many leftists treat me and my fellow trump supporters.
@RaulieGonzo @DiegoReneRod @TheReliantX @iwatchedbieber @kanyewest Women purposely cross the border while menstruating so that they have a lower chance of getting raped. Illegal immigrants who hang near our border often are drug dealers or rapists. Talk to any border patrol agent.

From 09-10 same house, but senate went to 59 majority. Also, that debt hasn’t been added on yet, it’s expected to be added on but in 1 year we have a lower gain of debt under trump than Obama.

@BiddulphHarold @Sen_JoeManchin He would not vote for Pompeo if it was 2019

@BlueRev0luti0n @funder @hiral4congress I spend every other week going to the retirement home buying dinner for every single vet. My best friend died in service. My great grandfather never saw his wife after deploying. And also, I don’t live with my mom. I started a small business and moved out the day I turned 18
@BlueRev0luti0n @funder @hiral4congress That was a mistake and a stupid comment and there’s no excuse for it. They’re just words though, I care more about policy and actions rather than words and accusations.
@Kaliburger @BlueRev0luti0n @funder @hiral4congress It’s amazing that you think I agree with Trump on everything.
@BlueRev0luti0n @funder @hiral4congress You don’t know a damn thing about me.

@BlueRev0luti0n @funder @hiral4congress Only supporting the troops when it helps you. Tell me what have you actually done to help veterans? Also, I thought personal attacks were below you, I guess not
@cocksailor @charliekirk11 If you want to get paid more get a better job or ask for a raise. With socialism the government (who never does anything right) decides if you get to eat or don’t get to eat. With capitalism you have the opportunity to make that choice.

@cocksailor @charliekirk11 You still get paid for your labor. In fact those “parasites” are the ones that sign the checks and give you a life

@SirEdmundBurke @Kirk21150437 @MokkashTanks @realDonaldTrump Wikileaks was by Julian Assange
@Ajrosner68 @SirEdmundBurke @realDonaldTrump However, I want proof that it did happen. If you’re gonna make a statement that controversial you better be able to back it up.
@Ajrosner68 @SirEdmundBurke @realDonaldTrump That’s fair. However I’d like you to prove that we landed on the moon. I could say it’s all bs and irrelevant &amp; we’d get nowhere. The only proof I see it didn’t happen is the amount of investigations that have come from it have produced nothing, and Trump has pissed Putin off.
@tappnfast @Jedisofreddit @realDonaldTrump I agree with that. But so far many executive orders by Trump have been about undoing many of Obama’s executive orders that should’ve gone through Congress. I don’t care what the republicans did or didn’t do
@MokkashTanks @SirEdmundBurke @realDonaldTrump That’s a suit I bought with my own money I got from a business I created after climbing my way out of debt and poverty. Go to hell.
@Jedisofreddit @realDonaldTrump True. Not everyone could. I’m just saying that it never should have been an executive order.
@ElHenderz @realDonaldTrump Truly intellectual. Using e-cards to get your point across. Congrats.
@tappnfast @Jedisofreddit @realDonaldTrump So? We’re just talking about these two presidents. I’m just stating that Obama should’ve never done it as an executive order in the first place.

@cnnbrck @GedesBru @joshtheapostle @ALLVETSADVOCATE @rvikander @charliekirk11 They could reverse that decision
@GedesBru @joshtheapostle @ALLVETSADVOCATE @rvikander @charliekirk11 No the court doesn’t but they interpret the constitution however they wish. The could interpret the 2nd amendment to only mean muskets and that would basically repeal the 2nd amendment
@GedesBru @joshtheapostle @ALLVETSADVOCATE @rvikander @charliekirk11 The founding fathers didn’t create the constitution to change, they knew time and technology would change but they created a document to apply indefinitely without alteration.
@GedesBru @joshtheapostle @ALLVETSADVOCATE @rvikander @charliekirk11 I’m just worried that someone who had that power actually believed that. If we had 5 of him on the court then real damage could be done.
@GedesBru @joshtheapostle @ALLVETSADVOCATE @rvikander @charliekirk11 A former Supreme Court Justice who was beloved and adored by gun control advocates said it’s time to repeal the second amendment.
@KyleKashuv @Rob1Ham Kyle I’m crazy about grammar and your tweet is fine
@KyleKashuv @davidhogg111 I’d love to see that!
@KyleKashuv @thehowie go try buying a gun from a gun store. You’ll see due process you fool.
@2ASupporter1996 @Education4Libs @KyleKashuv Agreed
@davidhogg111 calls @IngrahamAngle a bully. @davidhogg111 has been nothing but a bully! Attacking hundreds, degrading thousands and acting superior to anybody who has a different view &amp; @EmmaGonzalezUSA openly admitted to bullying Nikolas Cruz! Why doesn’t Hogg call her a bully?!
@Education4Libs @KyleKashuv @2ASupporter1996 I’ve noticed lately a really great way to get people  who push for more gun control to understand who ridiculous they are is to take them to a gun store and have them ask what needs to happen before they can even get a gun.

@DebbieLesko has served my state with the utmost dignity and has put Arizonans first every step of the way. I proudly endorse her for AZ District 8 special election. She is strong and tough and will fight for Arizona and America!
@union_wife @MaricopaDems @hiral4congress @CardenasForAZ @KelliButlerAZ @D28Dems @LD29Democrats @AZLD22Dems @ld18dems @IndivisibleofAZ @Slugocki @LD27Fern If you don’t mind me asking, what motivated you to vote for @hiral4congress over @DebbieLesko I’m genuinely interested.
@BrandonUrness @DebbieLesko Congrats on the right choice!
@rish_mehta @HillaryClinton I want them to shut it too. I don’t support @MittRomney or @SenJohnMcCain

@IWiIlKAGA One in a million in how he articulates himself and the self respect he has for himself and others
@KayaJones @KyleKashuv @hulu @IngrahamAngle Cancelled as well
@KyleKashuv They’ll destroy anyone who disagrees with them.
@KyleKashuv Hope you &amp; I end up working together in the future
@KyleKashuv Love your stuff
@davidhogg111 isn’t @AdolfHiltler that’s a stupid insult and degrades us all. At least Hitler was smart enough to not proclaim his hatred of a free society.
RT @phillipjpeterse: @KyleKashuv what do you think? Also @2ASupporter1996 @UnlimitedTide https://t.co/6Ym9r9IZEY
@clairevpickett loved your tweet about how you view your future marriage. Logical yet funny, well done.
@phil200269 @GaetaSusan @davidhogg111 Herpes because just when you think it’s finally going away it gets crazy again
@TrumpsArmyDawn @DaveSchreiber3 @HillaryClinton @OutnumberedFNC @FoxNews Don’t forget @algore
@2ASupporter1996 @KyleKashuv @C_Sommerfeldt @mollyfprince I love math cause I’m good at it but I don’t like world languages too much... but I will say that has actually been useful
@KyleKashuv what do you think? Also @2ASupporter1996 @UnlimitedTide https://t.co/6Ym9r9IZEY
@2ASupporter1996 @KyleKashuv @C_Sommerfeldt @mollyfprince Lol, tests and quizzes aren’t actual work. School needs to be reformed to prepare kids for life, not exams.
@RealOmarNavarro @jlocke7272 @mflynnJR Omar I like you, but personally I think @DuterteCA has a better chance at beating @RepMaxineWaters in the general. I agree with you Omar but I’m just letting you know my honest view
@UnlimitedTide @KyleKashuv Without their propaganda machine (think about it: CNN, NYT, MSNBC, etc) the moderates would separate because there wouldn’t be a media filter to see the far left wingers in
@UnlimitedTide @KyleKashuv Exactly. Without the media the left would fizzle into obscurity and a new more moderate Democrat political party would be formed.
@UnlimitedTide @KyleKashuv First rule of debate: as soon as you get emotional you lose.
@UnlimitedTide @KyleKashuv Nobody trusts the media. We need tough people who will put America first and see through the lies.
Thank you @davidhogg111 you convinced to buy an @NRA membership. You really are a great salesman @KyleKashuv #NRALifeMember #2AShallNotBeInfringed #IStandWithLauraIngraham
@UnlimitedTide @KyleKashuv If I can’t clarify my stance I should shut my mouth because obviously I have no idea what I’m talking about.
@UnlimitedTide @KyleKashuv Yup
@KarinHousley will be a fantastic senator for Minnesota! I love your state and have several relatives who reside there. I wish her and Minnesota the best of luck!
@UnlimitedTide @KyleKashuv Didn’t want you thinking I’m someone I’m not
@UnlimitedTide @KyleKashuv Can’t handle anyone who disagrees with him. I live in a moderate district and my school is about 25% conservative, but they’re scared of staring their views and so many kids have never had their opinions challenged and when someone finally does they crumble.
@UnlimitedTide @KyleKashuv I have more rational conversations in a day with an older person than I have in my life with people my age hahahahaha.
@SoCalValleyGal @KyleKashuv @C_Sommerfeldt @mollyfprince Of course he is, but he loves all the attention.
@UnlimitedTide @KyleKashuv I don’t even understand what you’re saying... might you clarify?
RT @KyleKashuv: 2/3 of gun deaths in America are suicides. Less than 1% of all gun deaths are mass shootings; per DHS, the weapon of choice…
Somebody told me recently they don’t own a gun because they’ve never once needed to use one and don’t know anyone who has. That’s because those without a gun don’t live to tell the story about how they needed one. @KyleKashuv #MAGA2018
@Fuller8D @KyleKashuv @C_Sommerfeldt @mollyfprince Dude if liberals like @davidhogg111 thought logically, then this country wouldn’t have sanctuary cities.
@2ASupporter1996 @KyleKashuv @C_Sommerfeldt @mollyfprince I’m a suburban kid but my parents only got me what I needed. At 6 years old I started a business so I could buy LEGO sets. Now the phone I type on, the books I read, the trips I go on... all paid by me and I’m damn proud. No allowance, just grit and sweat and hard work.
@2ASupporter1996 @KyleKashuv @C_Sommerfeldt @mollyfprince I run my debate club and the teacher and I argue all the time but I can’t debate the other kids at all!
@aphill20 @Fuller8D @KyleKashuv @C_Sommerfeldt @mollyfprince God save us all.
