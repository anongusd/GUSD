@SmithCassie Sure! We'll see how it goes and evaluate. There might be a better way. The TxDOT regs suggest this being the first step.

Water Service --- Residents on Cobbs from 41st St. to 42nd St. and all residents on 41st St from Cobbs to Hillcrest will be without water due to an emergency water leak. Crews are currently working on this leak to make sure water can be restored as soon as possible.

@Katie_robbins Hi Katie! We've had SO many leaks due to cold weather with low pressure sections of town. Sometimes that causes the water to be different. What part of town are you in. We're happy to look into it.
@Bubblegum_champ On it. Thanks for reporting!
@Bubblegum_champ Where is this Matthew?
@VZWSupport Yes! Thanks for your time today!
@VZWSupport I'm not familiar with how to move them to the SD card?
@VZWSupport Verizon Messages
@VZWSupport Ah. There's a problem. 30.75 of 32 used. But I have an SD card in there with 10 GB available.  Can I change where messages are held?
@VZWSupport I'm using the Verizon app for messaging &amp; photos are not saved. In the past they would just stay in the conversation between parties or show up in the VZMedia part of the gallery. Now, they have to be downloaded to show in the gallery &amp; when I go back to the convo, they're gone.
