3.5 years after Trump's campaign announcement forced 5 Rabbit to break off ties, batches of La Protesta are still in demand. 		And a documentary on the whole gang premiered this past weekend in Chicago.  		Here's the trailer for the doc 'F*** Your Hair'		https://t.co/8cZrlbKwwp
After Trump was elected, 5 Rabbit's founders decided to use the original Trump Tower formula again. 		Now they would call it 'La Protesta,' and have each a part of the proceedings from each batch support a difference cause. 		One was DACA, another the environment and so on.
By the way, here's that logo of 5 Rabbit's beer: 		https://t.co/l4o5eVeWjP https://t.co/304ZkcQ3Af
Beer sales of 5 Rabbit's anti-Trump beer took off in Chicago, backed by an iconic logo of Trump's hair. They sold off the equivalent of 20,000 pints, and thought they were done with it. 		Here's a local bar owner explaining how fast it sold. https://t.co/ToksOl6YnH
The beer initially sold under this name, but then amid pushback over why they had to bring Trump's mother into all of this, they came up with a new name. 		Liz Garibay, a beer historian, made the suggestion: "[expletive] tu pelo," or "[expletive] your hair." https://t.co/L0RADfKZyC
Documentarians Jason Polevoi and Nick Jenkins explain what happened when some of Araya's warehouse workers got to the kegs:		They wrote on the Trump beer keg collars, "[expletive] your mother" in Spanish https://t.co/hjnYQFfrMk
Local bars heard about the problem and pledged to sell the Trump beer as a generic golden ale. 		But Araya's warehouse workers decided to put an expletive twist on the name. 		https://t.co/TR8eUOeybk
But Araya was left with 20,000 pints of Trump's Golden Ale. 		It threatened to put a huge dent in his business and cost him $10,000. 		He explained the financial hit it could leave him with: 		https://t.co/TR8eUOeybk https://t.co/xtijebq8PG
It was a Hispanic-owned brewery, and immediately after Trump made his comments about Mexican immigrants, owner Andres Araya cut off ties. He explains why: 		https://t.co/TR8eUOeybk https://t.co/HXcGhwBlwS
Here's my story about 5 Rabbit, a Chicago brewery which once made Trump Tower's 'Trump's Golden Ale.' 		Then Trump entered 2016 race, w/derogatory comments re: Mexican immigrants		Brewery was 1st company to cut ties, but were had 20K pints of beer left...		https://t.co/TR8eUOeybk

I'll be on NPR's All Things Considered shortly to talk about CIA Director Gina Haspel's briefing to lawmakers on the killing of Jamal Khashoggi
Here's the exact Corker quote: 		"I think if he was in front of a jury he would have a unanimous verdict in about 30 minutes... a guilty verdict." 		“There's no doubt in my mind MBS ordered, carried out, and knew what was happening all the way along.”
Sen. Corker, emerging from Khashoggi briefing, said that if MBS was in a courtroom it would take 30 minutes for jurors to unanimously convict. "No question" MBS responsible

Sen. Rand Paul says he couldn't even ask to be given access to CIA Director briefing: "I was not notified of the hearing...  we are reading about this in the media. So I can't even ask to be included in it."
Sen. Rand Paul rips Saudi Arabia for human rights abuses: "There's a game being played: 'oh we're going to let women drive, but we're still going to execute and crucify people.'"
Sen. Rand Paul: "The deep state simply means that the intelligence community has too much power... power that's independent of representative oversight."		Says they should protect sources and methods but the Khashoggi "conclusions shouldn't be classified."
Sen Rand Paul wants access to Khashoggi intel: "The definition of the deep state is when intelligence communities have so much power that theres no oversight... intelligence is only given to a few people within our system. That's more like an oligarchy... "
Sen. Rand Paul:  "Theres a CIA briefing going on right now from which most rank and file senators have been excluded... I know information about the CIA's conclusions only by reading about it in the media."
Republican Sen. Rand Paul is outside the briefing CIA Director Gina Haspel is giving on Khashoggi, blasting the "deep state" for not briefing the full Senate on the intelligence. 		Said he was not notified of the briefing and only learned about it in the press.

@N1nja_Nick I guess that's my point: they should have sought medical attention immediately instead of cutting holes in throats
@doctorchiz That's outside my expertise -- my understanding that the thyroid cartilage is the site of the standard cric because the membrane there is the most accessible part		How much more difficult would it be to go lower?
@WayneTrackerAG Consider the possible mechanism of injury -- could you damage the trachea via chokehold in a way where you could still have an effective surgical cric? I am skeptical

It says something to me that these SEALs felt like they could try this complex medical maneuver rather than go to the French clinic immediately		If they were trained they would know the military reasons to give a surgical cric are smoke inhalation/burns around mouth/facial trauma
Cutting a hole in someone's throat to open an airway is called a surgical cricothyrotomy, and is used in combat medicine as an airway of last resort. 		Why did the SEALs decide to do that in a non-combat setting? Were they trained to do so? Why didn't they seek medical attn?
One thing that jumps out to me is that the Navy SEALs allegedly choked the Green Beret, who stopped breathing. 		They decided to cut a hole (!) in the Green Beret's throat, which raises all sorts of red flags for me on the medical side of things. https://t.co/D8aeMliee5

It seems to me that we'd all like to think we'd jump into action in an emergency. 		But a suicide bomber exploded, and then a dozen IEDs went off, injuring ~30 people.		Many people would hesitate, surrounded by the dead and dying. Capt. Moreno had no hesitation. https://t.co/3M6FI8QX7G
One final thought: she was awarded the Bronze Star for her heroism on the night she died. But it seems to me that a higher award is warranted here. 		Does rushing into a bomb making facility after IEDs go off qualify for "gallantry in action" in regards to Silver Star?
Capt. Moreno, a nurse attached with a forward surgical unit, was killed in 2013 -- the same year that the U.S. made the very controversial decision to allow women in combat roles. 		It seems to me her valor was a strong argument in favor. Rest in peace, ma'am.
Found myself looking up and re-reading the story of Capt. Jennifer Moreno, who at 25 was killed while attached to the 75th Ranger Regiment.

Flake: 	"The country needs to feel better about this. … I'm not saying that this is going to change votes in the end, that a bunch of Democrats are now going to vote for him. They may not. But they'll feel better about the process.”
Flake on whether protesters moved him: 	Can't pinpoint, but "it has been remarkable over the past week the number of people who saw Dr. Ford yesterday who were emboldened to come out and say what had happened to them. I've heard from friends -- close friends -- and I had no idea"
Flake on what does ‘Current Credible Allegations’ mean? 		 “We'll leave that to the FBI…. I am assuming that the Ford [allegations] are there, and maybe Ramirez. But Avenatti, I don’t know… but that’s their call.”
Flake on how long it should take for FBI probe: 		“It shouldn't take that long. Remember the Anita Hill investigation took three days. What we've said is that the [Senate] will not have a cloture vote… until the report is final.”
Flake on why he did it: 		"There's lingering doubt out there among a lot of people that we haven't taken every taking every measure that we should to make sure that these allegations are dealt with."
FLAKE: “Let me just tell you in the negotiations just now Susan Collins and Lisa Murkowski were very much involved and they've been obviously very pivotal in this.”… had a “ sleepless night" after Ford/Kavanaugh testimony
Sen. Jeff Flake said he started talking to Sen. Coons about whether there was a time-limited process that Dems could support.		He points out that they are both on Senate Foreign Relations Cmte and thus travel together a lot -- and friendly w/each other
Sen. Murkowski	“I think it says that the Senate is going to do its due diligence as it needs to do... we've put priority on this, obviously. I am certain that they will address it as quickly as they can...  I think it was important that we were able to come to an agreement today"
Sen. Ted Cruz: 		“We’re continuing to proceed towards resolving this nomination next week. I’m glad that we’re moving forward with the nomination. The FBI will conduct a supplemental investigation and get the results to the Senate by next week.”
Sen. Lindsey Graham, emerging from negotiations over Kavanaugh delay: 	“I’m ready to go. I know enough. I think the process has been abused, but the people who are asking for this are very sincere, they are good people, and this is called democracy, so I’m open.”

Friendly neighborhood EMT with a PSA here. 		@MEPFuller are hanging out and having a drink and thought we'd make a video on why belts make bad tourniquets. 		For this improvised tourniquet, we used a decorative beer bottle opener, cloth, and a carabiner https://t.co/tnSvFuynen
No it won't. Big and common misconception here. 		Belts can slow bleeding -- better than nothing -- but they are terrible tourniquets because not malleable.		I would rather fold up a shirt and tie it over a stick, then twist stick to press down on the artery. https://t.co/U5arHhEjcX

@DBattisto16 @Lena_Richards There's, like, a whole two articles worth of stuff		I just tweeted the top line info!
@JW_Watch @Lena_Richards The stories go into methodology in great detail. This analysis was done by taking the content produced by the IRA-linked accounts identified by Twitter to the House Intelligence Committee.
In conclusion, thanks to NPR intern Naomi Shah for helping me sift through pages upon pages of tweets; and of course @Lena_Richards, who balked when I asked her to manually code 30,000 Russian troll tweets and suggested we do big data analysis instead
On 62 occasions, the Internet Research Agency shared same content as the National Rifle Association after an original NRA post.		There were also 28 occasions where the National Rifle Association posted similar content as the IRA, after the IRA went first.		https://t.co/NokElVv0UB
Here's the kicker: The National Rifle Association, on at least 90 occasions, promoted Twitter content similar to that of the Internet Research Agency, in some cases after the IRA had gone first.		https://t.co/NokElVv0UB
The IRA accounts have mentioned the @NRA, @NRANEWS, or @NRAILA accounts a total of 199 times. Dana Loesch, an outspoken supporter of gun rights who would become a spokeswoman for the NRA in 2017, was tagged 77 times on her Twitter handle '@DLoesch.'		https://t.co/NokElVv0UB
The Internet Research Agency also posted an image celebrating NRA President Wayne LaPierre's visit to the White House.		In another case, the Russian social media account directed its followers to an NRA Institute for Legislative Action alert. 		https://t.co/NokElVv0UB https://t.co/Cp6yHm81nG
Check out this Russian troll farm post, with the NRA logo, which cribbed from an NRA Institute of Legislative Affairs link: 		https://t.co/NokElVv0UB https://t.co/ydV83Ag02i
More than just messaging, NPR has also found word for word copying by the Russian Internet Research Agency from the National Rifle Association: 		Here's a side-by-side about how they wrote about the DNC's Keith Ellison		https://t.co/NokElVv0UB https://t.co/MHWFsodLBo
At least ten tweets from eight different IRA accounts went to Torshin. In some cases, Torshin wrote back. In one message, an IRA account sent him holiday greetings.		In another, they quoted, in Russian, a poem from Russian poet Mikhail Lermantov:		https://t.co/dT8BN3103e https://t.co/kBPKd5HKEG
By now there is a general public understanding about Alexander Torshin and Maria Butina. 		You might wonder if the Russian trolls ever talked to Torshin on Twitter. 		The answer is yes. 		https://t.co/dT8BN3103e https://t.co/dbacbepRVm
The IRA's agitation campaign was run by Russians out of an office in Saint Petersburg. How did they know how to pinpoint their political criticisms about the gun regulations in places such as Tehama County, California?		Fmr CIA @StevenLHall1 weighs in: 		https://t.co/dT8BN3103e https://t.co/kBkzSRYLFo
There was a lot of of what analysts call "semantic overlap" between the IRA and NRA posts ...  both groups stressed how unsafe they said America is, including because of violent threats, and consistently faulted areas by name with strict gun laws. 		https://t.co/dT8BN3103e
Here's how weird it was: even Russia's trolls that purportedly represented the left — including those which supported Black Lives Matter or were anti-police — also supported gun owners' rights.		https://t.co/dT8BN3103e https://t.co/f4T9PkBKbB
"I can't think of another issue where they don't play both sides in order to strike a wedge between them," said [Clemson Prof]  Linvill, who with Warren have done extensive work analyzing the millions of IRA tweets on a variety of issues. "It's 100 percent an anomaly"
Pro-NRA and pro-gun messages had more than 32.4 million potential impressions; anti-gun and anti-NRA messages had fewer than 6.7 million potential impressions. 		The pro-NRA messages had nearly five times the reach as the anti-NRA 		messages.https://t.co/dT8BN3103e
Here's the breakdown of the data: 60% of the Internet Research Agency's accounts were pro-NRA, pro-gun accounts; and they produced 77% pro-NRA, pro-gun content: 		https://t.co/dT8BN3103e https://t.co/HfYIgbuKlz
On every issue from race to healthcare, women's rights to police brutality, gay marriage to global warming, accounts associated with the "Internet Research Agency" amplified controversy by playing up conflict.		Except when it came to guns and the NRA.		https://t.co/dT8BN3103e
Russia's Twitter influence campaign was strongly pro-gun, pro-NRA, and echoed the NRA's views		The analysis shows that 77% of their content was pro-gun, pro-NRA; and 11% was anti		https://t.co/dT8BN3103e

New detail about Butina: She pushed for gun protests in US as early as 2014, well before prosecutors allege she began any scheme. 		"I think you need to hold demonstrations!"

RT @MeghanMcCain: I love you forever - my beloved father @SenJohnMcCain https://t.co/Y50tVQvlVe
In retrospect McCain also was able to have a sense of humor about being shot down in Vietnam:		"I intercepted a surface to air missile with my plane," he would joke. "That's not easy!"
Sen McCain made these terrible dad jokes all the time. If you went to his speeches on a regular basis you would hear hem over and over. One of his faves:		"Some people ask me how I felt after losing to Obama. I told em I slept like a baby... woke up every two hours and cried."
Sen. McCain and I were once in a conference in Halifax right before Thanksgiving. 		He said he wouldn't be deep frying a turkey that year because he had nearly set fire to his deck the year before. 		"Of course," he said mischeviously, "I've seen worse deck fires."
McCain once was in a terrible mood. Didn't like one of my questions and got up in my face before walking away. 		He later cooled down. 		Came back an hour after votes, looking for me to personally apologize. 		That was the kind of man he was.
For me my most potent memory of John McCain will be him stepping off the train in the basement of the Capitol. 		Half grin and half scowl:		"What do you want, you little jerks?"

All of images/video I've used in this impromptu bleeding control tweetstorm are found on https://t.co/Js27arCC2K. 		Reading these tweets is just a start. But I hope it has been interesting to you -- and maybe even a little helpful. #NSTBD18
As a summary, let's look at this flowchart: How do you stop bleeding in each of these scenarios?		#NSTBD18 https://t.co/ALPU2k2wfG
If you don't have a tourniquet, or the bleeding is in the neck, shoulder, armpit or groin, we're doing to do what is called wound packing. 		Stuff the wound with bleeding control gauze (aka hemostatic gauze) or clean cloth. The apply downward pressure with both hands. 		#NSTBD18 https://t.co/scJwE7zpZ4
Here's the basics of tourniquet usage: 	1. Tighten the strap of a tourniquet above the wound. 		2. Twist the rod until the bleeding stops 		3. Secure the windlass 		4. Note when the tourniquet was applied 		#NSTBD18 https://t.co/d7MoJA42ZQ
If you have a trauma kit, and the life threatening bleeding is on an extremity (arms or legs), use a tourniquet. 		I carry a CAT (combat application tourniquet) in my backpack. 		Here's a video on how to use one: 		https://t.co/QsdFnfvMUs
Direct pressure is accomplished by taking a clean cloth: 		1. Covering the wound and pressing down	2. If the wound is large and deep, you want to stuff the cloth into the wound.		Remember, the artery is deep inside the body, under flesh and skin. PUT AS MUCH PRESSURE AS POSSIBLE https://t.co/etUyQApFC9
C: Compression -- Bleeding control is fundamentally about putting pressure on a blood vessel.		Without a trauma first aid kit, the best practice is called 'Direct Pressure' #NSTBD18
B: Bleeding -- Find and expose the source of the bleeding so you can assess it		Remember, you're looking for spurting blood, pooled blood, soaked clothing, loss of consciousness. https://t.co/38SALtu3YH
@SamGV Our medical understanding of tourniquets have been radically changed by experiences on the battlefield in Iraq/Afghanistan. 		I think of a TQ as a first resort when it's on an extremity. No problem for hours, and in civilian setting you should en route to hospital by then
A: Alert 9-1-1 either by calling them yourself or having someone else call		When you're doing bleeding control, you're buying time for EMTs, paramedics and doctors to solve the problem. https://t.co/bWLgGHoLpA
Scene safety: This is your first priority. The situation becomes significantly worse if you become a casualty. 		If your safety is threatened, attempt to remove yourself (and victim if possible) from danger		If you have gloves, don them. 		#NSTBD18
What are we compressing? We're putting pressure on blood vessels to stop bleeding.		You can do this in three ways: applying direct pressure; or, if you have a medical kit, using a tourniquet or wound packing with gauze https://t.co/bvwgi9oWJr
Let's walk through the steps of civilian bystander bleeding control. 		First, ensure your own safety. Is it safe to step in? 		Second, follow the ABCs: 	A: Alert 9-1-1	B: Bleeding: Find/expose the bleeding injury	C: Compress: apply pressure to stop the bleeding.		#NSTBD18 https://t.co/0mKdKUhaOV
What is life threatening bleeding? If an injury cuts an artery, this is life threatening. Spurting, bright red blood is a key sign. 		Blood pooling, soaked cloathing, a partial or full amputation, an unconscious victim -- all are signs of a life threat. https://t.co/evPZobksCh
Why is bleeding control important? The body has approx 4-5 liters of blood. Blood supplies oxygen to your cells and tissues. 		As you lose blood volume, you start down the road of exsanguination - fatal blood loss. 		You can die of blood loss in as little as 2-3 minutes		#NSTBD18
Bleeding Control is an essential skill for a trauma situation. In fact, learning to control bleeding could save more lives than CPR can. 		Of the 147,000 trauma deaths in 2014, 30,000 might have survived with appropriate care, primarily control of bleeding 		#NSTBD18
Rick Santorum recently created waves when he said students should learn CPR to deal with shootings. 		CPR is not the right skill for a trauma scenario. Bleeding control is. So let's learn about it. 		#NSTBD18
Stop the Bleed is a government initiative that was created in the wake of the Sandy Hook shooting, to enhance public resilience to mass casualty events. 		But you're more likely to need to use bleeding control at a car accident or tripping and hitting your head than at a shooting
My credentials are that I'm a nationally registered EMT, which you can check on the registry here: https://t.co/aqo4DIHq6f		And I'm certified by the American College of Surgeons' Committee on Trauma to teach basic bleeding control.
THREAD: This weekend marks National Stop the Bleed Day, sparked when an Army SOF medic decided to see how many people could be taught basic bleeding control in one day. 		I'm going to try something new: teaching a BCon class via Twitter.  #NSTBD18 https://t.co/FdKJaQjGZy

In two letters to Sen. Ron Wyden since February, the National Rifle Association made no mention of any contributions from a Russian national -- despite being directly asked whether had been any.
@AkiPeritz It was $1K in 2012, as I understand it. But that is still not under $1,000
Week after National Rifle Association made 2 claims: 	1) No money from Russia-connected entities/individuals in 2015-2016		2) No foreign donations in connection with a US election		They acknowledge: 		3) It has received at least one contribution from Russian individual 2012-2018
The NRA's story here is odd for two reasons: 		1) A life membership cost $1,000 in 2012.		2) Kremlin-linked politician Torshin is not the only Russian individual to be a life member of the NRA. His aide Maria Butina claimed to be one as well. https://t.co/oF988Ciqav

@HarringtonHonor @jonfavs Yes my point exactly
@dmbmeg I figured getting into all that would be confusing. But obviously you're on a higher level of care!
@PhD_femme Goal one is to close the holes
@nycsouthpaw And teach people how to use them! Useless otherwise!
One last thing that is overlooked often: when you're trying to stop bleeding keep your patient warm, even when it appears hot outside. 		If a patient gets colder, his or her blood doesn't clot as well and so it is harder to stop bleeding. Use blankets, jackets etc
We use CPR on folks who are not breathing and have no pulse. We are trying to get the heart started again. 		In trauma situation the helpfulness of CPR is very low (some argue not useful at all).		Stop the bleeding by using direct pressure, wound packing, tourniquets
@Mike__Beshara @MattWelch Smart. Anything else?
@ihave42ofthem If patient is breathing you don't give cpr! Stop the bleeding so they keep breathing! Cpr is for people who are not breathing and without a pulse

@quintME74 @NatashaBertrand The bleeding should slow. If untrained just focus on the wound itself. Direct pressure on top of the wound. Stick with it.
@GabalaErenn @jptconnect @Fahrenthold Stay warm. Lower body temperature affects clotting factors. Warmer = less bleeding.
@debeehr @jptconnect You want to be two inches above the wound. If that point falls on the joint, place the tourniquet above the joint.
@TobinEcht @NatashaBertrand Take a class! Most are free. Super interesting and useful: https://t.co/tYzRQTLceu

@justdawn_ @NatashaBertrand Let me know if you have any additional suggestions or contributions!
Shock occurs when the body cannot get sufficient oxygenated blood throughout the body. From a layperson's perspective: stop the bleeding and keep the patient warm. https://t.co/0oA57PLWsV

In the wake of the shooting in Florida, key thing to remember is to -- if it is safe -- act SWIFTLY to put pressure on a gunshot wound. You don't have to be an expert. You are buying vital seconds for first responders to save the person's life. Anything is better than nothing.
Another way to buy time is to apply pressure to the artery above the wound as well. Let's take a gunshot wound to the leg		The femoral artery is located on the inside of the leg. While applying pressure, find the fold between groin/leg. You or another can drop a knee on it. Push. https://t.co/Ivk7G7G6U5
...  most dangerous bleeding is arterial bleeding. Will be spurting, bright red blood. People can die within minutes. 		If you have no medical supplies, act swiftly to apply as much pressure into the wound as possible. Lean into it. You are buying precious time for paramedics.
Friendly neighborhood EMT here. Let's go over what you should do if you come upon a gunshot wound. 		While there are many complications that can arise, depending on the wound's location, the first tasks are:		a) ensure scene safety 	b) put on gloves if you have	c) stop bleeding
