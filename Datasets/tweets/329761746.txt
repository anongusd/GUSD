‚ÄúCriminal jurisdiction in Indian country is confusing, but it will become debilitating if the Carcieri holding isn‚Äôt addressed‚Äù -Carl Artman
Carl J. Artman, former Assistant Secretary to the Department of the Interior issued the following statement regarding the Carcieri decision:
1-in-3 Native women R victims of domestic violence & sexual assault. 80 % of the offenders R non-Native & can‚Äôt be prosecuted by tribal govs
‚ÄúA [Carcieri fix] would have economic ripple effects that would be felt well beyond our reservations and it wouldn‚Äôt cost a cent.‚Äù - Keel
‚ÄúThe uncertainty around Indian lands is a barrier to economic development that could be removed in an instant.‚Äù ‚Äì Keel
Jefferson Keel, President of the National Congress of the American Indians, made the following remarks at an economic dev hearing on Dec. 1:
If the jobs provided by the Saginaw Chippewa Tribe in Michigan were to evaporate overnight, Isabella County's unemployment rate would double
The Shakopee employs 4,130 employees over 50% are non-Indian. The Shakopee also pay $170 million+ annually for goods and services
Minnesota tribes directly employ 20,550 workers. That makes the tribes #6 among the state's ten largest employers
Idaho Indian businesses create more jobs & economic activity than about ¬Ω of the 44 counties in Idaho
In many rural areas, tribal enterprises are often times the largest employers in their communities & employ high percentages of non-natives
Carcieri fix would cr8 more agriculture/energy production, infrastructure projects & jobs. New jobs=less unemployed families & more revenue
Congress passed Pipeline bill 2 provide 20k jobs. The Carcieri fix bill can create 140k jobs & costs $0. Time 4 job creation legislation
@IndianCommittee talked to top schools around US and grads still struggle to find work. A Carcieri fix would provide jobs & put grads 2 work
‚ÄúCarcieri is killing jobs in Indian Country, and its killing jobs in neighboring non-Indian communities as well.‚Äù-  William Lomax, NAFOA
Trust land is used 4 economic dev. These new industries need workers. 1000+ trust apps are in gov purgatory bc of Carcieri. Jobs are frozen
"Under fed jurisdiction" was never defined & no official list of recognized tribes existed in ‚Äò34. So it‚Äôs impossible to tell who‚Äôs affected
Carcieri leads to uncertainty 4 trust land status & is unfair bc it creates 2 classes of tribes: those that can have land & those that can‚Äôt
In Carcieri‚Äîthe Court ruled the Interior Sec couldn‚Äôt take land in2 trust 4 tribes if they weren‚Äôt considered under fed jurisdiction b4 1934
