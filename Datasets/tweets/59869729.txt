The Triple Alliance:	A group of three Louisiana unions that were integrated in the 1800s. They went on to fight against racial discrimination and led the charge in the 1892 New Orleans general strike which resulted in 10 hour work days and overtime pay for New Orleans laborers.
Karline Tierney.	Even though she was born in Alabama, she called Louisiana home and fought for women‚Äôs rights here. She served as the chair of Women in Politics to promote women in the political world  and led the charge to pass the ERA in Louisiana.
Gay Liberation Front of New Orleans.	Although short-lived, the organization led to first LGBTQ civil disobedience act in Louisiana with a protest on New Orleans City Hall and published the first LGBT Louisiana newsletter called ‚ÄúSunflower‚Äù.
Doretha Combre. 	A native of Rosedale, she became president of Louisiana NAACP, the first black woman to get elected in Lake Charles, and was instrumental in ending desegregation statewide including at McNeese State in 1954.

RT @Dewitt4Congress: Dozens of state AG‚Äôs, including @JeffLandry are suing to scrap protections for people with preexisting conditions. Now‚Ä¶
The Affordable Care Act protects ALL Americans from denials and hardship because of a preexisting condition. Without these protections all of us would be vulnerable to losing or being priced out of the healthcare we need. We can #ProtectOurCare by electing a Dem Congress on 11/6!
Since the Affordable Care Act was passed 8 years ago, Democrats have fought consistent Republican sabotage of the law. Democrats can do even more to #ProtectOurCare and to improve how the law works for average families by winning control of Congress on 11/6. #TakeItBack
No American should die because he or she rationed life-saving medicine or was forced to decide between vital medicine and food. Democrats agree that we can and must do better to reduce costs and improve our healthcare system. #ProtectOurCare
Democrats continue to improve how the Affordable Care Act works for American families by bringing down the cost of insurance premiums and making coverage more accessible, including with Medicaid Expansion that Republicans blocked at the state level in the past. #ProtectOurCare
Because of the Affordable Care Act, 17 million kids are no longer subject to lifetime caps in the cost of their care. For them it can be the difference between life and death. These kids are partly why Democrats passed health care reform as a matter of conscience. #ProtectOurCare
Republicans voted to allow insurance companies to charge older Americans up to five times more than younger people.  Now, older Americans are feeling the brutal pain of higher health costs from Republicans‚Äô health care sabotage and rising prescription drug costs. #ProtectOurCare
Republicans in Washington are putting in dire peril the health care of 130 million Americans with health conditions such as asthma, diabetes, cancer, mental illness or substance abuse including 68 million women and girls nationwide, and millions of pregnant women. #ProtectOurCare
When they did not get the votes to repeal the Affordable Care Act, Trump &amp; Republicans in Washington resorted to sabotaging our healthcare system to create an excuse to try again. Voting for Democrats to take control of Congress will #ProtectOurCare from more Republican attacks.
For 8 years, Republicans promised to ‚ÄúRepeal &amp; Replace‚Äù the Affordable Care Act. With 130M American relying on its protections for preexisting conditions, Republicans are hoping you forgot that &amp; will take their word today, not their word from 2010 ‚Äì Sept. 2018. #ProtectOurCare

Thank you for following! I‚Äôm excited to make meaningful reforms to Louisiana and throughout our nation. I can‚Äôt wait to be your congressman - I hope you will help me make that a reality. -@VoteJessee https://t.co/eBOaUY8O95
We need to refocus our efforts on helping regular working families and small business owners get up and running, instead of focusing so much of our budget and efforts on sustaining the modern plantation system of mega farms and mono-cropping. -@VoteJessee
My campaign is run off people just like you. Every volunteer or donation I get isn't from some organization. It's from friends and neighbors around the state. And every bit helps to ensure we can continue fighting for the people of Louisiana. -@VoteJessee https://t.co/eBOaUY8O95
Both of my parents were educators so I understand how hard it is to raise a family on a teacher's salary. We need to increase teacher salaries, increase funding for public schools, and put our children first before anything else! -@VoteJessee
I believe in the right of all people, regardless of their financial situation, to go to the doctor when they are sick. Period. No one needs to choose between a meal to eat, a day without paying rent, or not going to the doctor. -@VoteJessee
I can't win this race alone - nor would I want to! My campaign is ran by my neighbors and for my neighbors. I need your help whether that's knocking on doors, making calls, or making a small donation. -@VoteJessee https://t.co/8jhnZ1kqAH

I don't come from a politician background. My experience comes from working the same land my friends, family and neighbors work. I know what they've been through and what they need because I've been through it too. I'm excited to fight for them every day in Congress. -@VoteJessee
I'm not afraid to stand up to special interests. They've bullied the American people for far too long and I refuse to be held hostage by them. Because of that, my campaign is funded by contributions from people like you. Any bit helps. -@VoteJessee https://t.co/eBOaUY8O95
Our congressman can talk a good game, but make no mistake he is working hard against us.  Most offensive is his work to make it harder for families to access funds to feed their family when they are down on their luck.  That‚Äôs just wrong. -@VoteJessee
Working as a farmer, I've seen what our community goes through. I'm also not afraid of working hard. The people of our district don‚Äôt mind working hard and know it shouldn't be hard to raise a family.  They also expect their congressman shouldn‚Äôt be making it harder  -@VoteJessee

Baton Rouge has some of the worst infrastructure in the nation. We can fix that. Let‚Äôs get federal funds to repair our roads and bridges, expand alternative travel options, and reduce the high volume of traffic plaguing our district. -@Dewitt4Congress
Every time there‚Äôs a disaster in the country, countless victims have to beg Congress to get aid and relief. We MUST set funds aside, make insurance for disasters affordable, and build the infrastructure needed to minimize the damage they cause. -@Dewitt4Congress
üëâ I need YOUR help to win this race. Whether you knock on doors, make calls, or post on social media, every bit counts. I know how hardworking the people of #LA06 are - your small actions can make a huge difference. 	 -@Dewitt4Congress	https://t.co/8HuxlEpdrt
My life hasn‚Äôt been filled with law degrees or political insiders. It‚Äôs been about working hard and living within my means - just like you. We need someone who understands the struggles of the people they represent. 	That‚Äôs the experience I have. -@Dewitt4Congress

While repairing my home, I saw our disaster relief system fail my neighbors and myself. I saw our congressman getting in squabbles with our governor at a time when his constituents needed help, not politics. 		That's why I'm running. I know I can do better.  -@Dewitt4Congress
After the Baton Rouge Flood of 2016 destroyed my home, I rolled up my sleeves and got to work. I worked to rebuild and repair my home myself. -@Dewitt4Congress
I also tend to break a lot of stereotypes - I'm an #LGBTQ survey crew foreman. You've likely passed me on the highways as our team conducts our work. So I know how to work hard and fight hard and, with your help, I am going to be your next congressman. -@Dewitt4Congress
I was born in Sulphur and graduated from Zachary High School while working 40 hours a week. Currently, I work as a crew foreman for a surveying company, which has given me special insight into the state of Louisiana's infrastructure and how we need to fix it. -@Dewitt4Congress

Unbelievable. A small group of @LAHouseGOP refuses to compromise on #taxreform, and they immediately blame @JohnBelforLA @LAHouseDems and LLBC for refusing to compromise. If they can't do it on their own (they can't), they must negotiate in good faith. #lalege #lagov
The idea that individual members of the legislature or groups can‚Äôt get together at any time and start a conversation about the best way to resolve the impasse and fix the fiscal cliff, I think it‚Äôs disingenuous for the Speaker to have said that.‚Äù https://t.co/TfCboJNNhq
