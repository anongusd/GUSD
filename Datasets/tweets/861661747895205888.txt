@benshapiro 	#NorthKoreanSummit #TrumpKimSummit 		We berated Obama/Castro, we berated Obama with his nuclear deal.		We should be berating Trump instead of praising him, the LEAST we can do is expect some actual progress.
I will support this submit if there is actual denuclearization. https://t.co/YKb1fq1Bhl
@benshapiro 		So to be unbiased do I support both ObamaCastro and TrumpKim or neither?
@charliekirk11 And we would be saying		" 'Insert name of Democrat' is shaking hands with a human rights violators in a desperate bid to appease him. "
