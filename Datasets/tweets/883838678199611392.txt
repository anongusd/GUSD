@Ithebunny @TheBigAce @_White__Rabbit @JerryTravone @realDonaldTrump Kraig, pay no mind to him. Turns out he’s a phony committing Stolen Valor. He is definitely not in any branch of service. The wonderful people at #StolenValorWreckingCrew have been notified.

Friends! I need help spreading the word about this guy #StolenValorWreckingCrew #stolenvalor #TheResistance #votevets https://t.co/WhZfH3GUoD
@TheBigAce You’re reporting for reporting you for committing stolen valor and posing as a member of the USAF? That should go well for you. 	#votevets #StolenValorWreckingCrew #stolenvalor @usairforce @SonOfGodAndMan @AltStateDpt
@TheBigAce @JerryTravone @realDonaldTrump I wasn’t on your feed, dipshit! I hope you get your ass kicked by a real servicemember very quickly and I am going to put your name out there to the whole wide world as the shameful con that you are! SHAME!

@TheBigAce @JerryTravone @realDonaldTrump Where are you stationed? Your MOS? Commanding officer? Where did you do AIT/FS? Service Dates/duty stations?
@TheBigAce @JerryTravone @realDonaldTrump Men and women that are high ranking enough to pilot a jet like the one in your profile pic would not throw a temper tantrum simply because he was politely and respectfully corrected during a civil conversation.	How do I know that you aren’t? Because my family and I are USAF/Army
@TheBigAce @JerryTravone @realDonaldTrump I don’t know why you are attacking me, but I do know there is zero chance that you are in the Air Force.
@TheBigAce @FactChe30375577 @JerryTravone @realDonaldTrump Pardon?
@TheBigAce @JerryTravone @realDonaldTrump That’s worth mentioning and I appreciate it. He did, in fact, align with Harrison moreso than Jefferson and therefore his allegiance would have been Federalist, however, at the time of his first election there was no official party system.
