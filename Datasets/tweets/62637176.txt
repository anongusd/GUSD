@The_Cakeater @MaxRose4NY @agounardes 1904 was a long time ago and our city has completely changed just over the past 10-20 years in terms of neighborhoods &amp; population. Routings need to be examined &amp; reconfigured. FWIW, Byford has indicated that he'd consider radical proposals for redesigning the entire route system
@The_Cakeater @MaxRose4NY @agounardes If something forces E and F trains to run local instead of express Roosevelt Avenue, we'll feel it in Bay Ridge. Could the MTA make some changes to routings? Yes but odds are making something better for Brooklyn will make it worse for Queens. It's an ugly game of Whac-A-Mole.
@The_Cakeater @MaxRose4NY @agounardes R is the problem. It ran better when it was split because the R could only get screwed up by problems up to Montague. Now it can get screwed up by problems on the Broadway line in Manhattan, by merging Ns and Qs, and by the Queens Boulevard line.
@The_Cakeater @MaxRose4NY @agounardes Overall problem is R shares tracks with too many other lines. The slightest quiver in the other lines screws up the R. BMT also had second choice of easy routings under Manhattan a million years ago when subways were built. R has very tight curves that limit speed, etc.
@suhvaydruh Ha! Totally. We were cracking up when we took it
@The_Cakeater @MaxRose4NY @agounardes We've asked MTA a million times to run more trains on the R line and they say no point jamming more trains in tunnel if they're just gonna end up bunching at the curves, etc. Also wanna look into possibility of having J continue past Broad St thru Montague tunnel down to 95th.
@The_Cakeater @MaxRose4NY @agounardes Don't have time rn to argue hypotheticals. Do some commuters take the R all the way from Bay Ridge into Manhattan? Yes. I'm often one of them (95th to City Hall) Do the majority of commuters transfer off the R by the time it gets to Court Street/Borough Hall? Absolutely.
@The_Cakeater @MaxRose4NY @agounardes Agree. This idea is one of many and was never suggested as a panacea or a long-term fix. Ever.
@The_Cakeater @MaxRose4NY @agounardes Thanks for your feedback. All ideas on the table.

@exenezoom Now THAT is controversial
@BayRidgeDrivers 1904 was a long time ago and our city has completely changed just over the past 10-20 years in terms of neighborhoods &amp; population. Routings need to be examined &amp; reconfigured. FWIW, Byford has indicated that he'd consider radical proposals for redesigning the entire route system
@danhetx That's not even a contest.
@BayRidgeDrivers If something forces E and F trains to run local instead of express Roosevelt Avenue, we'll feel it in Bay Ridge. Could the MTA make some changes to routings? Yes but odds are making something better for Brooklyn will make it worse for Queens.¬†It's an ugly game of Whac-A-Mole.
@BayRidgeDrivers It ran better when it was split because the R could only get screwed up by problems up to Montague. Now it can get screwed up by problems on the Broadway line in Manhattan, by merging Ns and Qs, and by the Queens Boulevard line.
@BayRidgeDrivers We're talking in circles now. R shares tracks with too many other lines. The slightest quiver in the other lines screws up the R. BMT also had second choice of easy routings under Manhattan. There are tight curves that limit speed. It's a problem.

@BayRidgeDrivers Nothing wrong with that. Your job as a constituent is to demand more from your electeds. All suggestions should be on the table but nobody has a monopoly on "good" ideas. Our idea was one of many that have come from fellow riders but it was never put forth as a panacea.
@BayRidgeDrivers I don't care about stats on paper; I just wanna get people where they've gotta go on time. We all agree the status quo ain't working but we can't just sit around and wait for the status quo solutions. Your grinding ideas you don't like into the ground does nothing for anyone.

@ceonyc Do some commuters ride the R all the way from Bay Ridge into Manhattan? Yes. I'm often one of them (95th to City Hall) But do the majority of commuters transfer off the R by the time it gets to Court Street/Borough Hall? Absolutely.
@badler Other idea would be to stop the loop at Canal which would be the first real hub on the R into Manhattan. The fact that a quiver in service in Astoria can cause delays on Manhattan-bound trains from Bay Ridge or Park Slope is a real problem.

My man Karl pulls out an old camera and starts snapping photos of the models as they pose behind a backdrop of urban rot and a chopped cheese bodega on the corner. There's a flash on Karl's camera, and film inside I assume, but it's clear he has no idea what he is doing.
All of a sudden, this guy gets off the bus dressed head-to-toe in black, leather gloves, big sunglasses, the whole bit at 2 AM. All in black except for a white scarf. Guy looked like he was from outer space. Takes me a minute before I realize its #KarlLagerfeld.
Finally a few fancy-looking people start slowly trickling out of the party bus. I realize they must be models. They're all striking a pose. Some start climbing on scaffolding on Suffolk Street. I remember someone had a basketball. It was embarrassing.
I think it was 2006. I was a bouncer at a bar on Rivington across from Streit's matzo factory. It must have been 2 AM when one of those airport shuttle buses pulls up across the street and parks at a hydrant near Marta Valle. The bus sits there for a while but no one gets out.
EMS workers are paid substantially less than other uniformed services. This sends the wrong message that we don't value the critical services they provide.		We cannot pit first responders against each other. When others run out, they run in. EMS workforce deserves pay parity. https://t.co/IBxsCN9w2F

Inmates with asthma repeatedly reported trouble breathing in the cold.¬†They've been ignored. 		All were very upset about the lack of information as to when they will be able to speak to their families or lawyers.¬†¬†		Complete lack of urgency from #MDCBrooklyn staff.
Inmates who have run out of medication cannot receive refills, they are being told, until the phones &amp; computers come back up.¬†¬†		One inmate who takes 8 different medications said he has his pills but can‚Äôt see which is which because it's too dark.
Phone lines and computers are down. Inmates have no way to contact family or their attorneys. 		Elevator service has also been spotty.¬†		Numerous inmates describe asking for but not receiving medical care.
West side is significantly colder as this side of the building faces the water. Inmates here are wrapped head to toe in blankets and towels.¬†		Some inmates said cell ceilings are leaking and their beds are soaked.¬†¬†		Apparently roof has significant leaks that haven't been fixed.
Here's what I'm hearing from someone who works inside #MDC: 		Corrections officers in lobby are wearing multiple layers with scarves wrapped around their heads.		The east side of the SHU that doesn't face the water is now relatively warm but cells are still in total darkness.

I reached out to the Headmaster and spoke with 2 current teachers who said everyone at Poly is taking this very seriously and is equally appalled and ashamed but that the students are united as are the teachers and admins to address this together  in a real and meaningful way.
The good news is there are more people here who love than hate. There are more people here who know why this is so terribly repulsive and offensive than those who do not - or worse, those who simply do not care. 		Remember, the opposite of love is not hate but indifference.
For me, representing our community means celebrating and promoting all the great things but also not being afraid to challenge and work on fixing the things that we‚Äôre not proud of. We will never get anywhere if we act like everything is fantastic all the time.

Some drivers need to realize that there are actually things in life that are more important than getting from one stoplight or stop sign to the next as quickly as humanly possible. @NYC_DOT @NYPDnews @StreetsblogNYC @NYC_SafeStreets
In order to accomplish this, we need more enforcement because, the truth is, all the stop signs, flashing lights, speed bumps and traffic rules in the world just do not matter without enforcement.
When I got elected, I decided I would seek to accomplish two main goals during my first few years in office: Make my district the cleanest and the safest in the city ‚Äì and that includes pedestrian safety and keeping our streets safe for all to enjoy.
For people who get behind the wheel of their car and think they are the only person on the planet who matters, there is unfortunately no known antidote. Common sense, courtesy and respect for human life are things that unfortunately cannot be legislated.
Today, in my district, there were 4 crashes in 8 hours. One crash ended with a middle school kid being taken away by ambulance.		I am tired of people getting tickets for being a few minutes late to move their cars for alternate side but not for blowing through a stop sign.

Bloomberg closing Engine 261 was a mistake. Bringing it back will ensure LIC has what it needs. But we cannot ignore years of under-funding of the largest &amp; busiest EMS system in the world. As we build up, we cannot forget the people down below.
Across the city, EMTs &amp; paramedics are facing a major personnel shortage and are forced to do more and more with less and less. We can't allow rapid growth to leave residents in danger.
Why are we only worrying about this now that Amazon is coming? As NYC population grows, fire and emergency responses break records year after year adding up to a 30% increase in response to fires &amp; emergencies over the last 5 years alone.
Hearing today on the impacts of development in LIC on emergency services raised so many questions. One thing is clear: what worked 20 years ago when LIC was mainly warehouses, will not work today. LIC was already the fastest growing nabe in country long before Amazon came along.

@JanelleLouise22 @MarkTreyger718 Yes - they need to build the infrastructure in Coney. They had to do it in Bay Ridge as well. We had the  pier but not the ferry slip. I'm confident it'll get done even sooner than 2021 but let's see.
@MarkTreyger718 @TaraStrome Also, it will be quicker than taking the Belt Parkway to Williams to buy my wife candy apples! I believe that is called a win-win-win!

So, about one hundred years before we had real estate therapists &amp; expensive acronyms like TriBeCa, SoHo, DUMBO and NoLIta, there was a rechristening. Driven by marketing, inspired by geographic features and fostered by the colonial penchant for reinvention, #BayRidge was born!
But after yellow fever and the yellow plague hit, nobody wanted to live in a place called Yellow Hook anymore. Suddenly, these landowners found themselves with a serious PR problem on their hands.
165 years ago today (December 16, 1853) a bunch of landowners got together and came up with the name #BayRidge. Back then, the neighborhood was still called Yellow Hook, named by the 17th century Dutch settlers for the color of the soil.

I'm aware that many businesses choose to go "cash only" because they don't wanna deal with the crazy fees credit card companies charge for transactions. CC co's also squeeze small businesses for the "privilege" of renting their card readers. Another issue we need to tackle.
@embernic @scwheaton11 technically not illegal
@abesilbe @RitchieTorres Yeah. I just said that on another thread. That's another issue we need to tackle. Credit card companies squeezing small businesses for the "privilege" of renting their card readers is just crazy.
@scwheaton11 I understand a lot of cash only spots do it because they don't wanna pay the fee that the credit card companies charge for the blissful privilege of renting out their card readers - which is another issue altogether.
I support this @RitchieTorres bill but I say all businesses should accept all forms of payment. The "cash only" spots are no better. The "sorry we don't accept credit cards but there's an ATM in the corner that will charge you a fee to withdraw cash" routine has gotten old too https://t.co/imHqhiVt91

#WorldAIDSDay reminds us how far we've come and how far we still have to go. Silence still equals death for millions of people around the world. It's up to us to identify and remove obstacles for people living with and affected by HIV so they can access healthcare and support.
While HIV/AIDS is now considered a manageable disease, the path to treatment remains difficult to impossible for those without access to healthcare, and the infection rate is still high among gay and bisexual men of color, as well as adolescent girls in sub-Saharan Africa.
More than 70 million people have become infected with HIV since the 1980s. Some 35 million have died. Homophobia and government inaction allowed AIDS spread. It was only thanks to the tireless work of activists that our country was forced to finally reckon with the disease.

@slimoctavo @Naparstek Do you spend any time talking to regular people? The hostility I sense from you is odd. My stances and advocacy around improving public transportation are well documented. Fairly sure we're on the same page here.
@TransitCenter @LEPCreature @Naparstek I support and believe any and all solutions or suggestions from congestion pricing to municipal control should be on the table and seriously considered. And I've been very vocal about this for ages. Nothing's changed, folks.
@LEPCreature @TransitCenter @Naparstek Part of my job as a leader is to lead. The other part of my job as a leader is to listen.
@LEPCreature @TransitCenter @Naparstek It would be irresponsible for me to ignore or discount the healthy cynicism that so many New Yorkers have about all of these issues. That is what I was verbalizing last night. I wasn't "issuing a false opposition" but channeling/sharing exactly what I hear from my constituents.
@juliannemcshane @Mariocaggiano18 @FrontusforNY "Ultimately the assemblywoman used the Q to clearly state her position &amp; now it‚Äôs on record" -- fair point.
@inklake @Komanoff @Naparstek I should've used conflate.
@juliannemcshane @Mariocaggiano18 @FrontusforNY K - and that's your call as a journalist which I respect. I'm just saying I don't think those who took issue with question are out of bounds.
@Komanoff @Naparstek @agounardes @JDavidsonNYC Appreciate your help. The @StreetsPAC community was a huge force in Andrew's win. I am good on CP; I was just thinking out loud last night. If you follow my Twitter, you'll know that's not new.
I'm lucky to represent one of the largest Arabic speaking communities in the entire country.		Today at 1:15 PM, on the City Hall steps, we will announce the introduction of a bill that will require Arabic-speaking interpreters at poll sites where needed. 		This is long overdue.
@juliannemcshane @Mariocaggiano18 No one would ever accuse you of just asking the easy questions ;) I think it's a sore spot because the Farrakhan question was a loaded one posed to @FrontusforNY during the campaign by her rivals and now it was being asked by a newspaper which gives the premise validity.

@CarloScissura It breaks my heart to see so many empty storefronts when I know there are people who would love to fill these spaces... if only they could afford to.  Gotta find a way to encourage landlords to rent to small businesses even if just for a short-term lease.
@CarloScissura But the landlord who leaves his storefront(s) open for years on end because he's waiting for the perfect tenant who doesn't exist is absolutely at the epicenter of this epidemic.  Something's gotta give.
@CarloScissura Yes. I know this. It's happening all across our city and it‚Äôs terrible. There are many factors. Retail is on the ropes. Amazon has cannibalized everything. Shopping local has become the conscientious thing to do but its not always the most convenient thing. Therein lies the rub.
