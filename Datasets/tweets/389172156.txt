@LindseyGrahamSC @realDonaldTrump You are so funny. The only thing Trump wants is to put golf courses and lodges in Autocratic Countries. Are you really serious about this support you give this idiot or is this just a way to help the CIA ? 	I only at this time have some belief in President Pompeii

@samstein #Exactly. Can‚Äôt be said too many times. He broke it and acts like if he fixes it that‚Äôs great. What an idiot.

@BrianKarem @realDonaldTrump Tee up baby- just another reality show photo op. You did get some good questions and we saw how much you adored  and bowed to another dictator.
@senatemajldr Sounds good. We will have the same as you.
@RepJeffries And Kim knew about Otto. Also tell Mr Higgins everyone knows where the boxes are. The FBI has them. 	Sad
@GeraldoRivera @MichaelCohen212 You obviously are the Far Radical Right. Cohen exposed Trumps Crimes. 	Get over it. It‚Äôs a good thing.

@MalcolmNance Look at that ‚Äúdo you like me ‚Äú look!!! Just like a baby bowing to a dictator.
@tedlieu @realDonaldTrump Right
@ZerlinaMaxwell I know. Tired of this put down from media and politicians. We do care , we are watching and we are concerned about a criminal in the WH and abuse of taxpayers money.
@EricHolder Well said
@RepAdamSchiff Thank you.
@MEPFuller Womp Womp , if he was so tore up then he shouldn‚Äôt of paraded that young lady out there and mention Alabama. His job was to ask legitimate questions pertinent to this case not crap all over Cohen. He works for the citizens and the constitution. If he can‚Äôt do his job go home

@tedlieu @GOP @realDonaldTrump @POTUS Thank you again sir. Well said. I have said it tweet after tweet. This is disgusting. Why is the GOP not protecting  the Country?
@AndreaCiniero @GOPoversight @RepMarkMeadows That‚Äôs GOP. The Democrats are providing oversight not under sight and over look. 	Meadows if you are such a friend to Cummings then listen to his closing statement over and over again. 	Do your job - protect our Country not the current president. 	Leave Alabama out of it.
@KenDilanianNBC @ckubeNBC @carolelee Reality.
@Tackspayer Yes it is.
@JoyAnnReid And adding her Fathers is from Alabama..... insulting
@ZerlinaMaxwell And ....... using Alabama. That‚Äôs really insulting.
@girlsreallyrule Puts it all in perspective. GOP would be smart to listen to Cohens statements about blindly following Trump. Time to wake up before we all our Nuked. If they don‚Äôt think that can happen in America listen closely to Putin. 	Trump needs to go for the benefits of our Safety
@RepRaskin @allinwithchris @OversightDems Thank you for your service today. Great job.
@PreetBharara He‚Äôs an idiot.
@JamilSmith I agree Disgraceful to use that women and Alabama in any of his statements. Meadows is sickening. No desire to reveal any truths. Jordan is just as sick.
@chrislhayes What do they mean ‚Äúno longer‚Äù?
@McFaul @AOC No wonder the Far Radical Right are afraid of her. Another mic drop moment. https://t.co/YURQJU76Jo
@RashidaTlaib @OversightDems Yes it does. So what‚Äôs next? The GOP apparantly are  as corrupt as Trump. What‚Äôs next? Judicial Branch needs to weigh in ASAP. 	These are extraordinary times. A criminal , immoral person is in the Oval Office making dangerous moves with dangerous Countries. ACT NOW
@SocialPowerOne1 Lou just needs to go to the nursing home.
@JohnBrennan That came through today so clear. GOP looked like a bunch of idiots with no intelligent questions or input.
@funder But... but.... I‚Äôm sure he has a lot of black friends.
@StevenBeschloss @DavidCornDC May??? If the GOP doesn‚Äôt wake up we are all screwed.
@DavidCornDC Just a handshake or a flamethrower or a saw.
@SenDuckworth That I agree with. Trump needs to go - Impeach it Amendment 25 - indict and arrest him. Whatever works. Just get him out of the WH.
@SenDuckworth They were not complying with anything anyway. Just like Russia. To believe there was any check on this before would be naive.
@JustClaudia3 @POTUS Did you expect anything more then that? Just a BS waste of taxpayer money for another ‚Äúpoint to moment‚Äù
@RepCummings Thank you for your service sir. I appreciate your difficult job you did masterfully. I feel that finally - some in Congress will do their job and protect the American people. 	With Trump giving us away to Kim today and Putin and the Saudis- American citizens need protection
@peterdaou Cause he is a racist
@peterdaou It was a real mic drop moment https://t.co/PYf9nFpuMn
@BrianKarem Wow- or on my best Little Jimmy Jordan ‚Äúwhoa- whoa...‚Äù wonder what the Far Radical Right think of this??

@peterdaou @RepCummings Oh yes, he is. Preach to me baby.
@BrianKarem @realDonaldTrump I don‚Äôt think we will have to worry about that. Trump will be in jail.
@kdoright @gtconway3d Radical Right movement headed by Trump with #LittleJimmy and #MerkyMeadows sad show of ignorance today. But..... SNL material....priceless
@gtconway3d What‚Äôs concerning is the GOP is not interested in driving out a corrupt president. I really don‚Äôt understand their gain unless it‚Äôs strictly some kind of cash arrangement.
@SenSchumer @senatemajldr Thank you. Someone in the GOP must act to protect our Country and our citizens from the danger of Trump and his cronies.
@RepJeffries Please stop the GOP corruption of our Country.
@peterdaou I know like her emails about her grandchildren or recipes were something they really wanted.
@Jim_Jordan #LittleJimmy whoa , whoa ..... you really  sound stupid like #MerkyMattG  taking lessons from #PropagandaDon? I‚Äôm amazed that you and the other Radical Right GOP are not interested in stopping corruption in the WH and protecting public from Trump? Isn‚Äôt that your job?
@RepLawrence Thank you !!!
@RepLawrence thank you for your service and the comment on the Prop by Meadows -
@jemelehill Love this
@RepArmstrongND Obviously not true. 	Dakota is destroyed by the Tariffs and the tax scam Trump created and you protected him today. Sad. Citizens in your district should be aware of this.
@RepArmstrongND just wanna let you know - you look and sound very stupid. Apparently you have no knowledge of credibility if you are protecting the GOP cronies and Trump. As Cohen said ‚Äú continueing the narrative ‚Äú 	GOP not protecting the Country or citizens.

@RepSpeier Thank you for your service !!
@DrDenaGrayson @GOP @Jim_Jordan Bad choice. #Cohen 	#LittleJimmy #YaBurnt
@MSNBC She‚Äôs a disgrace. President has discredited himself.
@Lawrence Poor substitute.
@BrianKarem @RepRaskin Yes , he has. Our Country deserves protection against this criminal in the WH.
@peterdaou Certainly does not look like any of them are interested in our Country , American Citizens or Our Constitution. 	Sick of the GOP liars. Seems like they would want to know what Trump did and want to help us.  They work for us! Not Trump. 	#Cohen
@peterdaou #MeToo
@RepKatieHill thank you. I appreciate your service to our Country and Constitution. NOT TRUMP

@RepHarley TRUE.  Please help the Country!
@RepHarley @OversightDems Please do more then that!!!! Time is short. Russia,China , Saudi Arabia and NK are going to destroy us! With  the help of Trump - we need action.
@RepRaskin @OversightDems Thank you for your service. The comment of the day ‚Äú my colleagues are not upset with your lying,  they are upset that you stopped lying for the President‚Äù  	Please get Trump out and take his GOP cronies with him.

@SethAbramson True. Nothing but attempts to protect Trump.  Not working.

@NicolleDWallace When he lies.
@LindseyGrahamSC Yes at the orders of your boss - not the legal pres-
@fenrir_71 @JustClaudia3 I admire his courage and TRUTH and his evidence.
@MichaelCohen212 thank you sir. I believe you and appreciate your honesty and pointing out the GOP liars like #LittleJimmy and #JerkyJordan	America appreciates your truthful statements.
@RepGosar more of a disgusting show of protecting Trump - who is a pathological liar. You and the other GOP cronies are lieing and the Am people know it. 	Cohen is telling the truth you and the other GOP cronies care nothing for America , the citizens and the Democracy.
@RepStephenLynch thank you sir for calling out the Trump GOP cronies. Please tell me that there has got to be some that are not like the Meadows, the Jordan‚Äôs and the others??? Thank you for this valuable oversight. Please protect our Country and our Constitution.
@funder Also remove Meadows and Jordan and Comer. This is a disgusting show of treason by the GOP.
@JoyceWhiteVance What‚Äôs damaging is the GOP cronies that are so recklessly protecting Trump rather then trying to find the truth and stop Trumps corruption.
@joncoopertweets @TheDemCoalition Thank you !The GOP cronies need to be held accountable in their corrupt protection of Trump. They are obviously not protecting the Constitution or Country.
@BillKristol OMG , I wish I could have heard it. So disgusted listening and looking at the Meadows, the Jordan‚Äôs the Greens the Comers the Grahams in the current GOP.
@realDonaldTrump Cohen is a reputable truth telling person. You are a liar with GOP cronies who look very stupid on air. Cohen looks sincere and reputable.
@realDonaldTrump What a huge lie again!!! You have ruined Michigan , TN, the Dakotas and many more poor people employed in auto or farms.
@peterdaou True.
@realDonaldTrump Go home #DementiaDon tired of your lies and your propaganda.  Your cronies and crooks in the GOP not doing a very good job on your behalf. #LittleJimmy looks like a frat boy out of his league.
@LindseyGrahamSC You are a pathetic cronie. You should be interested in protecting the Country not pacifying the traitor in the WH.
@peterdaou Sorry. We will not lose interest. #ImpeachTheMF
@LindseyGrahamSC @realDonaldTrump Sorry, #GrahamCracker we believe Cohen. Not you or your cronies or the liars in the GOP or the WH. 	You are as crooked as Trump.
@realDonaldTrump Your a pathetic draft dodger. Don‚Äôt attempt to throw dirt when you are dirty. 	That means you are a hypocrite and a liar. 	What deals are you making with Kim? Let him have nukes so you can build a Trump Tower there? Or a Beauty Contest?
@RepMarkMeadows Please let the American citizens know why you don‚Äôt want to protect the American citizens and the constitution ? Strange very scary.
@Jim_Jordan @OversightDems Because the oversight Committee knows their is a criminal and a traitor in the WH. We know you are also a traitor to our Country and constitution.  	We don‚Äôt know why you have this loyalty , but it is strange. It seems you would want to protect the American citizens.
@Jim_Jordan Unbelievable disgusting lies from you. 	Can‚Äôt believe you support a liar and a criminal in the WH instead of the Constitution and the Country 	You are a Disgusting pathetic person - in the Ohio perversion cases and now. 	RESIGN

@realDonaldTrump We know it takes 30 min in tanning bed 2 hours to sneak the hairdresser in and fix the glue on the wig. Then you have to put on spanx to get in the chunky suits. Then of course you have to watch Morning Joe and munch down KFC. Putin calls you around 12 to give the orders.
@realDonaldTrump #PropagandaDon. Here you go again spreading lies. Obama was a great president that made us a strong economy you profited from then ruined with tax cuts for billionaires 0 for middle class 	GM left - soybeans ruined. 	Go Home
@DrDenaGrayson @CNN @MSNBC All so surreal. How has our Country gotten so off course? Not just with the Trump Organized Crime fam but the GOP standing behind him? The AMI scandal too!

@alexi @RepHaleyStevens Seems like Haley would stand up for what‚Äôs right and run in 2020. It‚Äôs apparent Trump has made a mockery of the GOP. Who is going to represent Lincoln ? Reagan and McCain? Thanks MSNBC https://t.co/vzxVTPiR97
@costareports True. So , why don‚Äôt they nominate a real peris for President rather then continuing to destroy the Rep party? Seems like one of them should be able to stand up and fight for the Reagan and McCain and Lincoln.

@maziehirono 1- Trump can‚Äôt understand 	2- Trump can‚Äôt comprehend 	3- Trump suffers from Cognitive  impairments  		For Congress to pretend that he can and not to act in the interest of the Country is dereliction of duty.
@SenatorDurbin 1- he can‚Äôt understand 	2- he can‚Äôt process or comprehend 3- he suffers from cognitive deficits		For Congress to pretend he can only makes them deeelict in their duties.
@MarkWarner 1- he can‚Äôt read 	2- he can‚Äôt process or comprehend 3- he suffers with Dementia 		Expecting any normalcy from this impaired man is sad and Congress is derelict in duties to pretend that he can.
