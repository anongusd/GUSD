It is the common heritage we inherited from our parents and have a sworn duty to preserve.	This is the country I grew up in.	It's how we were taught by example to behave.	This is what our great country and the idea it was founded upon should be
Watching grieving friends share their laughs and tears	for their friend @John McCain ‚Ä¶ my fellow Americans THIS is what unconditional love looks like. 	This is what civility and common decency sound like.	On our best days, this is what our country used to be.
If you are missing or not taping #JohnMcCain 's eulogy stories LIVE...you are missing a treasure of stories about what it's like to be a great American and unconditionally loved by a diverse community regardless of color, creed or political affiliation. #Glorious
If you did not get #JohnMcCain before, you will love him forever after you read his funeral strategy. God bless you John...fighting for inclusion and for the oppressed even in death; quite an achievement! https://t.co/kSW5EBgGq0
