Parents... Be vigilant!... Have open dialogue w\your kids that gives them the language they need to speak up if they have a need	For the rest, if you know a survivor,  nurture them and give them space to work through the pain	\fin
To wrap it up, the film just made me sad sad sad... For the kids,  for the extended families,  and for MJ,  who was clearly a broken child himself,  who had every advantage,  who made a conscious choice to break others rather than get the help he needed	\9
Why this movie now,  why sue the estate after MJ died? 	Well... Money could be the motive,  simple as that,  and not the best look, I suppose	But also,  I think, the need to finally! tell the secret.. Don't underestimate that need in the face of years carrying it	\8
Also,  yes.. MJ was very sick, and we all knew it,  for years... That something was very very wrong... But he knew what he was doing was wrong and harmful to those kids,  hence the extraordinary lengths he went to to cover it all up.. 	The tragedy is he didn't get help	\7
And @yashar is right... No grown man, for any reason,  should be sleeping in the same bed w\young children... Parents!... If someone is pushing these kind of boundaries in order to be close to your child,  beware! 	\6
I know many fans feel protective of his legacy,  conflicted about the artist and philanthropist vs the child sexual predator and I get that,  but arguments like 'they found him not guilty!' only further perpetuates the lifelong pain\shame his victims experience	\5
Further,  I believe these kids-now-men... As a survivor myself, I recognize the signs.. The flat emotional effect in relation to the sexual abuse itself,  the roiling confusion, pain and love they felt for him, the explosive reaction once they became parents themselves	\4
So I understand how the parents were seduced by MJ and didn't see the relationship he had w\their children as strange... They didn't have a framework to see it in those terms, I believe.. I'm not excusing them,  but I get how it could happen	\3
Something I think younger-than-i folks perhaps don't understand is that until the late 80s, the average person simply didn't have the language or context to even discuss sexual abuse.. It didn't figure prominently in the social lexicon the way it does today	\2
Just watched #LeavingNeverland and I have some thoughts... 	First off,  let me say,  I LOVED MJ.. I grew up w\him, he was omnipresent throughout my childhood,  had all the albums, mimicked his dancing,  etc etc... 	\1

@KwikWarren Kristin Nielsen		I hate that bish with the heat of 1000 suns
@CJWritesNThangs I'm a good person who genuinely cares for/has compassion for others
@CJWritesNThangs 'Friends' who mistake my kindness for weakness..finally! I stopped thinking that being kind doesn't have to mean always putting my needs last in order to put everyone else's first	That epiphany didn't go over with ppl...at all
@CJWritesNThangs I survived 2017-18....i was truly on my way out, lost over 100lbs in 10 mos, got so weak I could no longer support my own weight, was in a wheelchair for awhile, nearly had a heart attk	I fought my way back to up on my feet, doing ok!
@CJWritesNThangs True
@CJWritesNThangs I'm smart far beyond my formal education, I think	And that I'm unafraid to wear my weird on my sleeve
@CJWritesNThangs I'm always up for an adventure!
@CJWritesNThangs Why?...because ppl are human, and when someone is hurtful, of course it hurts...we may be able to control how we respond to hurtful actions/words, but controlling one's feelings, no...thats why they are called feelings..because we feel, even when we don't want to
@CJWritesNThangs Yes it can and I don't want to hear crap like 'only you are responsible for how you/react to the hurtful actions of others		Bullshit
@CJWritesNThangs Yes my grnddaughter, the other night, mouthing off as we were sitting down to take out, after we'd just dropped 50 bucks on beauty products 4 her, implying I didn't deserve my dinner..wouldnt stop, wouldnt go to her room, dared me 2 do something abt it	I fed her dinner 2 the dogs
@CJWritesNThangs My husband, who rarely graces me with a genuinely uplifting word, said to me while I was on the phone handling a major crisis re our granddaughter	'In a fight, there is no one I would want in the ring more, fighting for us, than you'
@CJWritesNThangs God please...pick your ppl well, don't let anyone, not even your children, step on you or hold you down/back
@CJWritesNThangs Not much of a circle these days, frankly...ive gradually culled all the users and takers from my life, which was basically everyone	Hubby, my kid, my grandkid and they all mostly treat me like crap while expecting me to facilitate their lifestyles by being an indentured servant
@CJWritesNThangs Not really
@CJWritesNThangs The day I graduated from CDL training and got my license...i was a woman in my 40s with a grown child who stood out on a hot parking lot 6 days a week for months and worked my ass off to get that license..everyone told me I would fail, it was stupid, but I did it!
@CJWritesNThangs Declined
@CJWritesNThangs As much as possible, provided one stays humble too
@CJWritesNThangs I'm very kind, maybe too kind
@CJWritesNThangs Hmmm...i don't put much stock in physical attributes...my smile, I guess
