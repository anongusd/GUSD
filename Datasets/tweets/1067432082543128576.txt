@TalibKweli @agreatgoy2 @MarxWatchdog @zeleftcantmeme @carpediemmonst1 @HonoluluHuckaby @VibeHi @benshapiro Is he serious? The blues or folk music comes from slaves playing music for the quests of their slave masters. More to the point all manner of instruments were utilized in ancient Africa, flute, hand piano, string instruments etc.. We put the Greeks on, your Maga hat is too tight!
It's draconian but genius. Essentially they are using the office of the Presidency to gain back their financial footing, using the US economy as leverage against the Chinese government, and paying back loans with political favors. You wanted the country run like a business! Happy https://t.co/kZpCSD3IKa
@StefanMolyneux Perhaps or perhaps there is no merit to the science. I'll give you one example why this is so. How and who is determining who is "average" pertaining to the "on average"? What methodology, metrics, or controls were put in place to even create the pool to test from?
@Insoo18049360 @StefanMolyneux Said by Europeans. Again no group enslaved their own children, thats whats so incredible about the Americas form of slavery.
@Insoo18049360 @StefanMolyneux I dont think I am writing in a way you can comprehend, thats precisely what I wrote. Its either that or you are looking for me to educate you, I mean I can, I have no problem with that role, we are all student and/or teacher at some point.
@Insoo18049360 @confusedprofesr @basedandgraced @StefanMolyneux I dont think you understand what sort of "help" they received. They essentially are a state in Asia, there little no tariffs on their products. They wholeheartedly have been accepted in trade with the West. You know what...come back in a few years after you;ve read a bit more.
@Insoo18049360 @StefanMolyneux Extreme view would subjective I believe, and I wouldn't pretend the Protestants were the first "settle" in North America, books will help you see this clearly. Roman slaves were able to live their lives, marry etc. there has never been anything like American slavery in history.
@Insoo18049360 @StefanMolyneux I think you deleted a tweet, but I'll move past it. Capitalism is actually designed to exploit, that is kind of the point, what makes it work is man's inherent nature to exploit resources and each other. Nothing wrong with Capitalism in its purest form in my book.
@Insoo18049360 @StefanMolyneux Half true, sure slavery in its many forms has been a part of human history, however, in the case of Slavery in the Americas, never before have men enslaved their own son's and daughters. That hadn't even occurred in Biblical times, disgusting.
@Insoo18049360 @StefanMolyneux You dont really have a point as far as I can tell. Try to stay on topic. I dont really care about whatever contrived economic methodology you choose to plunder the globe with, point is the settlers were invaders.
@Insoo18049360 @StefanMolyneux I wouldnt say that is fair to say at all. Western civilization normally sends "peaceful" emissaries to ascertain the lay of the land. Very smart group, I will certainly give you that. Either use trade or religion to hide true intentions of barbarism.
@confusedprofesr @Insoo18049360 @basedandgraced @StefanMolyneux That is correct.
@Insoo18049360 @basedandgraced @confusedprofesr @StefanMolyneux In the 60's, seriously. Africa had already been plundered for 100's of years at that point.
@Insoo18049360 @basedandgraced @confusedprofesr @StefanMolyneux Citations for what exactly? South Korea is essentially funded economically by western civilization to stem the tide of communism. That the how and the why for you.
@esherman07 @RealCandaceO My happiness is not dictated by which political party is in power. My point, either party in power, has no interest in my or the people that look like me being happy. Your position illustrates that perfectly. I try not to attempt to make sense out nonsense, you keep trying though
@esherman07 @RealCandaceO I asked the same question, why the Republican party, shouldnt be any party as far as I can tell. You have stated exactly why we shouldnt be a voting block for either party, proving my point for me, you may not be a politician but your thoughts are shared by our Democratic leaders
@basedandgraced @confusedprofesr @StefanMolyneux Jewish slave traders, wow, don't read much huhn. Have you thanked my ancestors in Africa for providing the resources necessary for the continued expansion of white supremacy. Without Africa Europe would have fallen long ago. Africa is 3rd world only because of European barbarism.
@esherman07 @RealCandaceO I'm not advocating for the Republican Party, if you read my previous tweet more closely you would understand that."Dont let the door hit ya" I wish more Democratic politicians took that stance publicly, privately thats exactly how they feel. And that is the reason why or why not.
@esherman07 @RealCandaceO Doesn't "entice" black people, I was pointing out how they could put together a platform that "appeals" to black people. If you dont take care of your voters, and show up to churches to get votes prior to elections then disappear, you cant be surprised when the gravy train stops.
@confusedprofesr @basedandgraced @StefanMolyneux Colonial Power is a stretch for Japan, The scale and reach are infinitely smaller than the Western powers grip on the entire globe. Good try though.
@esherman07 @melanie920 @RealCandaceO Half true, they benefit the rich, yes, but at the same time, how many times have the Democrats specifically sold us out to get favor with swing and moderate Republican voters. My point is NO ONE is here to black people, that's my point, whats yours?
@esherman07 @RealCandaceO Not to defend the GOP but, blacks largely agree with the GOP on many issues. Blacks arent a monolith but in general, blacks do believe in: gun rights, Jesus like no one else, entrepreneurship, blacks dont believe in government (always did us dirty), homophobic, I could keep going
@basedandgraced @confusedprofesr @StefanMolyneux More nonsense. Japan hasn't successfully colonized any country, always outdone by the west. Your are correct to an extent, western countries convinced poor whites that they are superior based on "whiteness", really a ploy to further aristocrats' economic dominance. Bacons Reb!
@isitjustus2 Nice tax write off!
@melanie920 @esherman07 @RealCandaceO What's yours, you stated "Because Candace doesn't really care about policies that benefit black people." Well neither does the Democratic party or anyone else for that matter. Understand now.
@basedandgraced @confusedprofesr @StefanMolyneux Your not responsible necessarily but you are a benefactor from western powers colonization. You can't have it both ways, you will have to take the good with the bad, or create better policies. Gas on every corner is a wonderful thing, I am sure you agree. Think through your tweet
@dreambig313 @RealCandaceO Brainwashed just like most African American people following the Democratic party.
@esherman07 @RealCandaceO Democrats aren't looking out for black people either. Can you name the policies that solely benefit African Americans.
@Insoo18049360 @StefanMolyneux Nonsensical statement. Everyone lives day to day, and most "Native" tribes secured particular sets of lands, governed with hierarchy and even government bodies. The founding fathers patterned the constitution after the way the "Native's" governed. Thanks for trying though.
@RealCandaceO Your characterizations of how AA have been treated by the Democratic party aren't entirely off base, but I do have a question. Why would the GOP be the answer? Why not form your own party? I could get behind that.
@confusedprofesr @StefanMolyneux Half true, the INA and other international asylum laws were put in place by western powers, thus inviting those from countries from which western countries had destabilized to the point of chaos in. The thinking at the time was, it would largely benefit war torn Europe. Oops!
@BillSimmons Bill, always liked you! There isnt enough of you anymore. Miss the old site on ESPN
The Trump Shutdown, isn't about the Wall, its about starving the government of resources to delay further prosecution efforts (grand jury). Yes, the right wing talking heads want the wall, yes Trump listens, but the true reason why is, it may delay prosecution indefinitely.
@StefanMolyneux You have to change "settlers" to "INVADERS", then your statement would be half true. The "Natives" didn't ask for the asylum seekers, so you can't say they were settlers.
@drboycewatkins1 Problem with your take is Dr. King is the only one that achieved anything substantive. Brother Malcolm was correct on many things, Marcus had a point. You are missing the point we need all angles acting at once to achieve the change necessary to advance our interests.
Martin Luther King Jr., "The Drum Major Instinct" FINAL Sermon --- COMPLETE https://t.co/Gd7sbNMYxr via @YouTube		This is my favorite of Dr. Kings' speeches. It is as true today as it was when he delivered it. Rest in power Dr. King.
@Neesii1 Depends on who you ask, it's subjective but I tend to agree with your assessment.
@f2dc2af6daac4b8 @StefanMolyneux What is unnecessary intellectual power? That entire statement lacks intellect, what's your excuse. Your confusing IQ with brutality and lack of humanity.
@Neesii1 @StefanMolyneux That was pure gibberish. but thank you.
@StefanMolyneux Is the Homestead Act welfare? Foreign Aid given post WW2? Corporate tax breaks? Welfare has been granted throughout American history, and well thoroughly through Western civilization.
@rolandsmartin @NCCU We dont understand how important those 20 years were to the current economic structure in America, preach on this. Yester-years economics is a road map leading directly to todays social construct.
Giuliani just said "He nor the President could be sure that no member of his campaign colluded with the Russians" I've never come across a situation so comical but not funny.
@StefanMolyneux That list sums up the approach Trump takes to most issues.
@AsadMuhammad10 @Will81845766 @mrmagonegro @LouisFarrakhan What sort of nonsense, yea stop arguing with me, I feel my IQ dropping, yall got it. Believe what you like.
@AsadMuhammad10 @mrmagonegro @LouisFarrakhan Ok your no longer making sense, peace.
@mrmagonegro @AsadMuhammad10 @LouisFarrakhan Not sure what your point is, but agreed both religions forced on Africans.
@AsadMuhammad10 @LouisFarrakhan You speak of slave master and present slave master documents. Nation of Islam has been around for decades and has effected no change. Done nothing about nothing.
@SolomonSalizar @StefanMolyneux Reading your posts one would assume otherwise.
@AsadMuhammad10 @LouisFarrakhan You are correct, and they were assisted by the "Nation". That was your big receipts!
@AngieMuhammad15 @LouisFarrakhan I don't need to ask, I already know. Why don't you ask Arab Muslims their role in our slavery!
@LouisFarrakhan You said you played no role in brother Malcolm's death, that wasn't true
@JackPosobiec Obama didn't send nuke money, he released the funds being held due to the sanctions placed on Iran by western governments.

@SarahKSilverman Funny, you've never commented on the vile treatment of black Jews in Israel. Beaten, economically debased, raped, no political representation. Let's hear it, I'm not ready to give up on you yet.
@StefanMolyneux There is no such discipline in science that would give a scientist a title of "IQ" scientist. What you are referring to are scientists who cherry pick data and come up with inane hypothesis about how melanin in skin concentration dictates intelligence levels.
@StefanMolyneux @SolomonSalizar You weren't driven out my son, you left on your into the wilderness. We welcomed you home with open arms and retrained you, but we never the loss of humanity you had suffered. It's alright my child.
@MichaelAvenatti @ChuckGrassley What he's saying is likely true, 1. Iowans could care less that he's racist, he's representing their ideals, and 2. For him his support is more important than his principles. Send about right to me
@ATLBlackStar Where is the beating, where is the call for back up! Black citizens are murdered for less.
@DanRather We have to remember his insurmountable odds he faced then, are the same odds we face today, The bad actors of yesteryear are today's MAGA hat wearers!
GOP has no dignity. To claim that "whites" built the modern world, is equivalent to a man with sight bragging after blinding everyone else and being the only one able to see. Europe went on a world wide mass killing spree to acquire resources is nothing to champion yourself upon.
This morning I read the "I have a Dream" speech as I do every year on this day. How sad it is that the same injustices Dr. King spoke are continuing to happen (Police brutality, economic injustice, gov't mandated genocide (Flint!)). Hearing Rep Kings comments, "white supremacy"
This picture says it all about this President. Fast, cheap, all advertisement no value, thoughtless, careless,. No one should get mad at any player for not going to the tRump White House after a chip, he didnt even bring the playground or nothing! The clown is there though. https://t.co/qA87mqOOhe
@AhmedBaba_ Wait...he invited them to the White House to have hamburgers? Why hamburgers, why not Ramen Noodles and Kool Aid?
@elisabeth I didn't know you couldn't mouth off to a cop. I thought we had rights, rights for some but not all.
@drboycewatkins1 What can or should he do? Why pose this question?

@shaunking @AOC I don't believe this report from politico. Politico has shown time and again there lack of research, they want eyeballs without the work.
Cowardice all around, from the cop running away from the confrontation ( dont be afraid brothers, they are more afraid of you than you know) to the bystanders allowed to commit assault.

@oldmanebro Bro, are you serious, do you not have the internet at all. But to answer your question, WRONG. All the way through, I won't tell you why because I believe in self education, especially for adults. Don't you do a hip hop show, talk about Nikki Minaj ass or something, not politics.
doesn't give him or anyone else license to dehumanize people in this way. As a society we have to stop placing an elevated perceived value on normal everyday humans that have a particular talent. Stop with idolization of celebrities and that could stop predators of this nature.
R. Kelly is a monster, yes, a pedophile, yes, a sick individual, yes. Should he be silenced, yes. But let;s not forget to mention the societal tone surrounding success, celebrity, and money. There is far too much value we place on entertainers, the fact someone can sing,

RT @jmeacham: America should “build a wall of steel, a wall as high as Heaven" against the flow of immigrants.--Georgia Gov. Clifford Walke…
followers have to endure. Listen to what he is and isn't saying, deciphering it can be a challenge at times, however he tells you everything that matters when he talks, and you know where and what he is thinking at all times, unfortunately his thoughts only focus on self. Dem2sft
but I am probably guilty of some other minor offenses. His argument is why does anyone care about my business dealings or a little shadiness, business across the globe and in American politics are shady, just look at the Clinton's and they arent being persecuted that I or my,
Now if you listen closely, he doesn't focus on impeachment based on guilt or culpability, but on the perception of a job well done. Again that's his perception, fact/fiction whatever, point is he really isn't saying he did "nothing" wrong. He is saying collusion I knew nothing, https://t.co/bo2xxMg2KM

@KamalaHarris It helps but its not the solution.
(cont) So yeah we are ripe for the picking, easily could be sent over the edge with the proper suitor to hold our hands, lick our wounds, give us a fair shot, and that would not be our doing. We have been here for hundreds of years, share in this America, never treated as such.
(cont) against African Americans, repeating the lie of (Black on Black crime is responsible, single mothers are responsible, etc.) none of which have anything to do with the violent procuring, sourcing and defending the natural resources needed to generate and sustain wealth.
(cont) they would need to look no further than the African American population. Trump said it, "What do we have to lose!?", Mass incarceration, police brutality, red lining, poisoning, wealth disparity, just to name a few. This country has flaunted their human rights abuses
The Russian effort to influence the African American voter is interesting for a significant reason being overlooked, it's easy! African Americans have been and still are so mistreated, dejected, and abused by this country if there were a foreign power looking for an insurgent

When the NRA stands up for law abiding registered gun owners being shot in the street by police, like Philando Castillo, then we can have a more engaged and merited conversation, until then "1of6"
@tattoojoshiz @NancyPelosi 6 million people manage, operate, and promote the NRA??
Now this right here, FACTS, 100%! We are always picking up the mantle for those that stay idly by, entertained by our suffering. Is it shame on them...or is it shame on us defending those that won't even piss on us if we are on fire. https://t.co/atZH246Uml
@NancyPelosi Hearts still break! Go break the NRA, Nancy!!!
Institutional disenfranchisement, purposely removed from the prospects of JUSTICE! This is not a civil rights issue and never has been, its a human rights issue, state backed and promoted genocide. Its been this way since 1676 in the US. The UN has to step in, Dubois was right!
GOP ideology makes no economic sense. Tax cuts would never go to creating more of the same product, that t drive the price of the product down, and it cano to hiring more workers to meet the same demandx, that would cut into profits, makes no sense economically. Who e https://t.co/9pbRoWIyun
@marcorubio You are for this ideology. Where do you think tax breaks for the wealthy and corporations go. Why would they create more product, that would drive down it's price, why would they hire more people to meet the same demand, that would cut into the profit margin, your smart, stop it!

@SenKamalaHarris @IamMsTish Senator, I am a bit confused as to why the US was backing the Saudi government in its war effort against Yemen in the first place. Yemen offers no strategic advantage militarily, economically, nor politically to the US. What it looks like is the SA is annex their neighbors. No?!!
@BDolanSFR @oldmanebro IF @oldmanebro was truly backing the MeToo,or just being a truly descent and humane individual, he would NEVER had Kodak Black on. Why give him any light at all. His job is to entertain, which is fine, but don't play crusader, its disingenuous at best and opportunistic at worst.

@DevalPatrick We need more than just your support, we need your actively guided hand over our legislator. I know your tired, I know your wary, I know your jaded, maybe even a bit afraid but we need you part of the legislative body. Let's go!!!!
I thought Kushners' job was preventing this from happening. I thought Trump turning a blind eye to the Khashoggi murder was going to prevent this from happening. Art of the deal my ass! https://t.co/tAzfxTrTeL
@EricHolder @ButtersV2 😂 Seriously, it's as American as war, genocide, and apple pie. We need you back in the game, get your second wind and get back in there, it's crunch time, let's go!
@shaunking @LucetteIMCE They're playing by the rules, Democrats don't come to play. Bullies have to get punched in the mouth and there is too much at stake for Democrats to play the punk role. Somebody has to fight DeeBo.
@cynthiamckinney @Nasadamu1 This is a terrible idea, the potential for attack is way to great, the expense way too high, and benefits entirely too low. Bad idea for everyone involved actually.
Betrayal of the public's trust should be given the same gravity as that for grounds of impeachment. Lawmakers that signed on to this farce should be punished with perpetual disqualification from holding public office, No matter your party, our leaders should not stand for this! https://t.co/E4sIjOvt6o
@MichaelAvenatti Trump is already defeated, we need a management recovery specialist that can clean up the mess he's going to leave behind.
Let's never forget our true history, we didn't lose control of Kemet (Ancient Egypt) until the 5th century BC, and before then we shared political control with the Greeks, however we were still the predominant population, Know Thyself! https://t.co/NiIzJpGHyA
@DonaldJTrumpJr That's not true, name the bill!
@deray Genuine, thank you Sis!
@ImBlackISAYSO2 That stat is wrong!!!! She just made that up,😂😂. We need her though. I'll explain, you can't plant spies without a viable belief that Black people could view the world from their lens. If we all think a like, or pretend to, we can never infiltrate. Let her go!! You gon head boo
You have to tell a detained person why they are being detained. If he poses an clear threat to the officer, public, or himself he can be detained. However, him being Black does not constitute a clear threat, but does show clear racism. Mr. Lamont Hill what do you think, professor https://t.co/2IieD1o531
@SenWarren @WellsFargo Lady E, here's a fix for them, if Wells Fargo holds your mortgage you officially now own your home outright, mortgage cancelled. Let Wells choose between that or a fine and the CEO has to listen to you go off for an hour every morning at 5am.😉😂

@ProudResister @Fleurdelisazure @realDonaldTrump @GOP What a time to be alive! Now what happens after the facts come out. Enough of the country will believe that the findings are fake, the left isn't tough enough to do anything of consequence, and we will be left with the damage long after he has left office.
The stories can flow non-stop, we need those with the platforms, CNN correspondents, journalists, activists, focused entirely on the plight right here in America. You are our light, and when light is focused it can burn hot enough to start a fire, light your people up! https://t.co/gSuSBVwWBh
If you are a Black intellectual, especially with a platform, this needs to be in your sphere of focus. While injustice is categorically wrong, and happening across the globe, we need your focus and attention on these incidents, topics, and injustices. We need your brilliance! https://t.co/yjMZI2ArXu
George H.W. Bush (along with a coalition) went into Kuwait, beating back Saddam Hussein. When Saudi Arabia eventually invades Qatar, will the US have the same "fortitude" and attack it's "ally"?

New technologies create new industries and new jobs. Pretending that expanding measures to create more green tech is literally holding humanity back from growth. Arguing it's going to destroy the economy is taking a similar position to those protecting the horse n buggy industry.
If Mueller does find that Trump culpable, who can restore the damage he's done to the economy (deficit, trade wars, inflation)(hasn't shown up yet, it's coming though). Who's going to restore the dignity to the office? Who's going to bridge the divide? Who?
@ShortGuy45acp What does people processing anything differently have to do with anything. There is a right given to citizens by the Constitution, all perception should be looked at through that lens. Your individual perception should have no bearing on my rights.
@ShortGuy45acp Gangsta rap, so your saying because of the entertainment performed by a few, the other 38 million of us should be shot on the street. By your own logic Italians should be profiled by the police and shot because of the Godfather. Entertainment should not dictate my freedom.
@ShortGuy45acp Actually statistically it is more likely to be a Caucasian shooter, this is a fact not opinion.

@VyCanisMajoris0 @NPMPParty @samieyani @marclamonthill @BDSsouthafrica Speaking of South Africa, can you think of a Western nation where Blacks control so much of the wealth and political capital, don't preach to me that oppression has no color, it often looks like your profile pic
@VyCanisMajoris0 @NPMPParty @samieyani @marclamonthill Never ever preach to me because I am black that I have to speak up for every oppressed group in the world because we have been the most horribly treated by the West, you can't 12 years a slave and think you know the thousands year history of death and destruction brought to Afric
@VyCanisMajoris0 @NPMPParty @samieyani @marclamonthill Not about religion it's about focusing ones effort on their own freedom. I don't see Muslims at BLM rallies, I don't see them speaking up or sending in the military to free black people, but as a black man I am supposed to take up the mantle to defend the rest of the oppressed, N
@VyCanisMajoris0 @NPMPParty @samieyani @marclamonthill @BDSsouthafrica Guess what, you can sell out all you like, my statement still stands, focus tour efforts in freeing yourself in your fight. Nigeria, please don't get me started, on you.
@VyCanisMajoris0 @NPMPParty @samieyani @marclamonthill @BDSsouthafrica Oppression has a race and it usually mine, and the oppressor usually looks like you. Don't speak to me about oppression while Western corporations hold control of all of the natural resources. How dare you, when we have been murdered, enslaved, disenfranchised, how dare you?
@VyCanisMajoris0 @NPMPParty @samieyani @marclamonthill @BDSsouthafrica Only those that have tasted oppression are you serious Mulsim nation's still rape and murder in black nation's and have done so since the 5th century when they toppled Khemet I remember the killings and rapes in the Sudan, I still remember the atrocities they have committed.
@VyCanisMajoris0 @NPMPParty @samieyani @marclamonthill No country sent in an army to free African Americans, Jews did what exactly to help black people to regain control of the natural resources taken and stolen, where is our Israel, where are the nuclear capable Black led nation Israel helped to create?
@VyCanisMajoris0 @NPMPParty @samieyani @marclamonthill Right with them how? Sent an army, ran out the oppressors, I think not! Listening to Mandela is fine and well, however the facts lay bare, Palestine or any other Muslim led country has ever lifted a finger for the African American or the black diaspora, my statement still stands

The civil war was fought to prevent southern states from leaving the union. Lincoln was no abolitionist, the freeing of the slaves was a strategic move. Disney led to reconstruction, to segregation, to today's institutional racism. Stop trying to self sooth your evil. https://t.co/D95uQLa0Ln
@PeoplesCourt79 Agreeing with his politics is one thing, celebrating the actions he made to make the world a worse place is an entirely other thing. You can show humanity and compassion while also laying bare the injustice one perpetrated. No matter how much you bend over they won't accept you.
@CharlesMBlow There will be nothing interesting, Trump wouldn't say a word, he knows he's intellectually outmatched. If anything he may request different seating arrangements.

@NancyPelosi @HouseDemocrats Great now let's get something accomplished or mire us in hearing after hearing that isn't going to get us anything but providing a platform for delegates to impress the cameras.

@US1Southbound @marclamonthill Answers no questions, its not where they are enslaved, but who is enslaved and how. Is this evidence that further proves your argument of Muslim's enslaving Africans.

@S_Evangelina @jackieaina @Monicastylemuse @nymatang Why are we waiting for beauty brands to recognize us. That's a a missed opportunity, business wise and spirit wise. Why not make the "shades" ourselves, develop our own beauty brands etc... Any reason why it can't be done?
@US1Southbound @marclamonthill A statement followed by evidence would be considered an argument. Review for what exactly, whats your point or premise, that Mulsims enslaved or currently enslave Africans? Thanks for making my point for me.
@realDonaldTrump It's essentially the same deal as NAFTA. Maybe slightly less favorable to America.

@ryangrim @marclamonthill More than likely they will have him back, after a few months, this wasn't a well thought out decision on CNN's part, this was a single powerful player there getting offended by the comment without fully digesting it. Once that powerful individual calms down a bit, he'll be back!
@Nasadamu1 @marclamonthill That's sweet, however the reality is not a single Muslim nation has stood up for the injustice perpetrated against black people. Feel deeply, great, however to be effective focus on fighting your fight, that's what the Palestinians are doing.
@Greg94531 @marclamonthill Your argument is based on geography, geography has nothing to do with my argument. A Palestinian living next door is unconcerned with my injustice. You mean don't be like every other ethnic and racial group in the world and ignore the plight of the AA for centuries. Get a grip

@marclamonthill Just stop it, Palestinians have never come forward to defend the plight of the African American. I have yet to see a Palestinian at a BLM rally, I have yet to see an Arab leader stand at the UN and make the case for the violations of human rights by US against Black Americans.
