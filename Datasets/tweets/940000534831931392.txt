@jimgeraghty Read it, thank you.		It’s not unusual for attorneys to advise on public statements &amp; press releases which may have legal implications. That is part of an attorney’s job, to advise their client in all legal matters.		Agree it may be a touchy point, but it was her job at the time.

@amyewalter @GovHowardDean It was @SpeakerRyan Paul Ryan’s decision to not take the original unanimously passed Senate CR to a vote in the House which got us here. Ryan, as usual, caved to T and forgot he is the leader of an independent branch of the government.

@ClaraJeffery @AriBerman Agree. 		Our precinct in California had nearly 70% voter turnout this election with little to no waiting in line at our polling place. 		Compare this to Georgia where a great many voters had to wait in line 3+ hours to vote.  That is unacceptable.

@Reuters Dear @tribelaw :  Is there a legitimate legal basis to ask the Supreme Court to do this?  Can the White House ask the Supremes to intervene at any time they wish?  Seems a great overreach and perhaps a first litmus test on the independence of the new Court.
@CNN The “invasion” caravan of mothers, children and those fleeing violence is ~1000 miles away from the border. 		Such a transparent and pathetic ploy one week prior to the midterms. 		And at what cost to the American taxpayer?  Moving 5k troops and their supplies is not cheap.

@LindseyGrahamSC Let the public see and review his full record and then we can decide. It’s the right thing to do before making a lifetime appointment.
@realDonaldTrump Another inheritance from the Obama administration. The current bull market started in March, 2009 in Obama’s first year as president. So that is 8 years under Obama and less than 2 under Trump.  Facts Matter.
@jwpetersNYT @kylegriffin1 “You get what you pay for.”
@jaketapper @PressSec @kaitlancollins The “perjury trap” in a nutshell. @realDonaldTrump can’t help but lie and can’t keep up with his own never ending stories.
@FoxNews All headquartered in California and the state of Washington.
@redbrianwhite @CNN The topic is longest bull run in history. That started in 2009. Not sure which economist would disagree with that. Or do you mean Trump is responsible for the 8 years of the run when Obama was president?  I’m certain no economists would agree with that.
@CNN Another inheritance from the Obama administration. The current bull market started in March, 2009 in Obama’s first year as president. So that is 8 years under Obama and less than 2 under Trump.  Odds that Trump will make it to 8 yrs on his own?
@GOP Another inheritance from the Obama administration. The current bull market started in March, 2009 in Obama’s first year as president. So that is 8 years under Obama and less than 2 under Trump.  Facts Matter.
@IngrahamAngle "Don't do the crime if you can't do the time."  Cohen and Manafort both knew exactly what they were doing for years.  As have the other Trump associates who have pled guilty so far.  They are lucky to get a deal.
@IngrahamAngle This isn't about left and right, it's about right and wrong.
@FoxNews @kayleighmcenany Not true.  Illegal border crossings dropped dramatically under the Obama administration, decreasing to the lowest level in 40 years.  Obama took office in 2009, and note the extremely high levels prior to that under the last Rep administration.  Get the facts: https://t.co/pQU728CZrx
@Pattonwashere @VictoriaLennon8 @dbongino @realDonaldTrump Did you see the news today?  Cohen is done (money went thru Pecker, as detailed in this article).  Cohen implicated Trump directly as part of his plea. Just the beginning. Have patience.
@SenTedCruz The answer to school shootings is not to turn schools into "hardened" bunkers (imagine being a child in such a school environment), but to control and limit access to the guns. Please shift your priorities and do what is right.
@RealJamesWoods He has been in the US since 1949.  He was first tracked down in 1993 (under Clinton).  The deportation process started 14 years ago, well before Obama.  He was ordered to be deported in 2004 but no country would accept him until now.  Get the facts:  https://t.co/lgzQoROamJ
@GOP A lie.  These tax cuts are benefitting only the top 1%.  According to the most recent BLS report (Bureau of Labor Statistics), real wages for American workers have declined over the past 12 months.  Get the facts:  https://t.co/bdigVQVgt5
@dbongino Dude, you are part of the entertainment industry.
@Pattonwashere @VictoriaLennon8 @dbongino Funny you mention the National Enquirer, which under the leadership of David Pecker, bought out and buried numerous stories of @realDonaldTrump affairs with porn stars.  https://t.co/EFPYU7GUID . The Special Counsel Investigation summary in Wikipedia has 570+ documented sources.
@dbongino Collusion is only one piece of this.  Through July 2018, the Special Counsel has publicly initiated criminal proceedings against 32 people—five U.S. nationals, 26 Russian nationals, and one Dutch national—and three Russian organizations.  Get the facts: https://t.co/9xNR7F34Td
@SecretaryAcosta @GOPLeader @POTUS Yet real wages are declining while inflation is increasing, forcing people to work longer hours while still not being able to catch up.  https://t.co/bdigVQVgt5
@GOPLeader @jack @IngrahamAngle Not only is this ignorant of what really happened here, it's improper to use your office to improperly threaten a public company with congressional action
@FoxNews @MickMulvaneyOMB But the proof is in the pudding.  Real wages are down over the past 12 months while inflation is up, forcing people to work longer hours while still being unable to catch up.  https://t.co/bdigVQVgt5

@GOP What is the real motivation for this deregulation?  Seems to be all about a few elite making a quick buck at the expense of the rest of us.  https://t.co/1AFFp59xwX
@thehill @Pontifex should act here and do what is right.
@RonWyden Thank you.  Please keep fighting this.  This is nothing more than theft and robbery of people's money with no in kind consideration in return.
@FoxNews If he is such a superb nominee, then why is his entire record being held from the public?  The public deserves to see and review his full record before being confirmed to a lifetime appointment.  It's the right thing to do.
@washingtonpost Yes
@GOP @realDonaldTrump What about real wages?  Down over the past 12 months.
@GOP @realDonaldTrump He inherited one of the best economies in history
@thehill Why are publicly funded DOJ lawyers involved in this?  Isn’t this a private business which @POTUS has supposedly removed himself from in terms of day to day management?  Shouldn’t this be managed by private practice lawyers hired and paid for by the business itself?

@thehill Surprised this wasn’t automatic after pleading guilty to lying to the FBI about contacts with Russia
@JohnJHarwood Agree
@BillOReilly Part of being a great nation is also honestly recognizing and addressing our shortcomings and failings. That is the surest path to continued greatness and integrity.
@vanitaguptaCR @NAACP_LDF Agree
@Mikel_Jollett @NAACP_LDF @ChuckGrassley Dear @ChuckGrassley, why are you hiding Kavanaugh’s complete records from the American people?  Why the secrecy?  We deserve to see them.
@Heritage Republicans insisted on reviewing Sotomayor‘s complete record. That is what is different. What are they hiding in not releasing Kavanaughs full record?  The people deserve to hear all the facts on this nominee.
@FoxNews @RepPeteKing You are either blind or intentionally aiding and abetting the ongoing obstruction of this investigation.
@thehill State media?  Look in the mirror  @TuckerCarlson. 	 @FoxNews @seanhannity
@FoxNews Thought we already had a deal?  @realDonaldTrump @POTUS
@washingtonpost @postpolitics Which is why the Kavanaugh nomination is so important
@March_for_Life @Heritage @DailySignal @LRacheldG Why is access to his full record being blocked?  What is there to hide?
@thehill They are all such liars. Unbelievable.
@FoxNews “Only the best people”
@pewresearch Facts Matter.
@thehill Thank you to members of the free and independent press for securing this admission of yet another lie.
@TheEconomist There were 537,919 votes in the Dem primary for governor of Wisconsin vs. 455,966 in the Rep primary.  Walker got 417,619 of the Rep vote.  That's 92% of the Rep vote, but only 42% of the total state primary vote (Rep+Dem combined).  So how was Walker rewarded?
@politico As US Senators, can't they do more than simply "pan" it? @SenateGOP
@mattyglesias Complex national security issues span many years, even decades.  It's in the nation's best interest to be able to consult with prior officials possessing unique knowledge and experience with such matters.  This was a petty move which only weakens our national security.
@FoxNews @kevincorke @POTUS Is @POTUS kidding with this?  "Act as I say and not as I do?"
@ianbremmer Respectfully disagree with your 3rd point.  If/when our country needs Brennan's help/advice on a security matter of which he has particular prior knowledge and experience, he will not be able to help.
@thehill Yet another enabler relinquishing his duty to the country and the constitution. This is a petty move which will only weaken our national security.  History will judge you unfavorably @RandPaul .  Shame.
@mkraju @jaketapper History will remember how these petty enablers relinquished their duty to the country and the constitution to act as a check and balance on the presidency.

@FoxNews @POTUS Go for it.  Typical libel statute of limitations is 3 years.  When is the last time you made your birther claims on Obama @realDonaldTrump @POTUS ?
@thehill Not much of a business expert.  This guy clearly does not understand the difference between the General Minimum Wage and the Tipping Minimum Wage.  Raising the General Minimum Wage does not necessarily help waiters who rely on tips to make up for their lower Tipping Minimum Wage.

@politico Too late, that train left the station and she is too late and without a valid ticket.
@BBCWorld Seriously doubt this would have happened if Roy Moore had won instead of Doug Jones. Timing of the announcement is decidedly after Jones was sworn in. Kudos to the majority of Alabamans for voting with their conscience, these are the just rewards.
@FoxNews Nothing fake about this. Why won’t congress put petty party politics aside and jointly and universally unified come together to take this seriously?
@thehill It certainly should be.
@FoxNews @amprog Agreed.
@thehill Too bad.  Well done Senator Feinstein!
@thehill Given their position, if they see something they need to do something.  Temporary job security is not more important than the security of the country.
@RepAdamSchiff @POTUS That's what we were promised!  Don't let @POTUS force American taxpayers pay for this worthless wall.
@CNNPolitics Because he clearly doesn’t understand the complex issues involved.
@FoxNews @JesseBWatters @WhiteHouse @POTUS This is a nonsensical argument.
@thehill Because the public overwhelmingly wants net neutrality.  No matter where they live.
@thehill This article does not say whether a psychiatric evaluation is normally conducted in these Presidential physical exams at Walter Reed.  So what is it @thehill ?

@thehill An excellent example.  We should wish all citizens a happy holiday for their preferred religion, just as Netanyahu has done in Israel.  America is truly a nation of multiple religions and beliefs.  This is a fact and elemental basis of strength in our country's founding
@FoxNews If you read the details in the article, it's clear this is a claim against the CC&amp;Rs for their neighborhood association (a very common prohibition of signage), which the homeowners must have knowingly agreed to when purchasing their home in such a neighborhood, and nothing more
@FoxNews @dbongino All the more reason to have someone you trust at the helm.
@nytimes Facts are the best answers to questions like this:	https://t.co/Rxrp6DmMmh
@MSNBC Somebody probably said that about his grandfather once.  Wonder if he understands and appreciates that...
@realDonaldTrump Insider polls?  Meaning only ask people you can trust for a good review?  Does not sound like an open and transparent method for hearing the will of the people.
@realDonaldTrump If it was one poll we were talking about, maybe. But every poll is consistently low. Even the latest Fox poll.
@FoxNews @BenCardinforMD @FoxNewsSunday Agree
@thehill Life catches up to you fast when you ignore the will of your constituents
@Heritage Yes. But are they being surgically removed with a scalpel or with a chainsaw?
@FoxNews @GovMikeHuckabee Does his list ever change?
@FoxNews @JesseBWatters No
@MSNBC We would like to hear him say it.
@politico Harsh reality.  If you ignore the will of the people, it eventually catches up to you
@FoxNews @POTUS A bit early for a victory lap.  Only time will tell on this tax bill as to whether the promises of Republicans defy the nonpartisan scores.  History will judge, one way or the other.
@thehill Harsh reality.  If you ignore the will of the people, it eventually catches up to you.
@politico If my tax software makes a mistake, I'm still on the hook for it.
@politico Sounds fishy.  Doesn't a human still sign off on these filings?
@JustinWolfers I respect most of what Bill Kristol says, but agreed on this one
@kylegriffin1 Sounds like a clear case of Trademark Infringement (not Trump's first) with this abuse of the Presidential Seal
@AshaRangappa_ Da
@thehill Harsh reality.  If you ignore the will of the people, it eventually catches up to you:	https://t.co/hQLVAnawWU
@politico Harsh reality.  If you ignore the will of the people, it eventually catches up to you:	https://t.co/hQLVAnawWU
@thehill He admitted to it on tape, not sure what there is to question
@politico @joshgerstein Not sure how that can even be a question for the courts to begin with.
@thehill Agreed
@thehill Yet another case of trademark infringement by Trump with this abuse of the Presidential Seal
@FoxNews @LisaMarieBoothe Maybe there is a bigger reason. Non-partisan score just in confirms it stinks:	https://t.co/Ik8eV0SO59
@thehill Harsh reality. If you ignore the will of the people it eventually catches up to you:	https://t.co/hQLVAnawWU
@politico Please raise your hand if you have actually read the article and not just the headline.
@thehill agree
@realDonaldTrump And it's not good...
@politico The public needs to know which senators were behind these claims.
@realDonaldTrump Enacting this bill without first getting a non-partisan score is unconscionable.  Here it is now:	https://t.co/nBuQt5xoFy
@00001Kat @SenatorTimScott Do you have any facts for this claim?  Here are some independent assessments of what elimination of the mandate means for premiums:	https://t.co/1WhrwmjGxD https://t.co/UNqw3pIcHH
@WSJ @FreemanWSJ What they should say:  	Pulling the wool over the eyes of the middle class with a modest and temporary tax break to keep them quiet while at the same time giving tremendous and lasting breaks to the elites at the top.  Not sure this is what the middle class expected.
@FoxNews @SenMajLdr Heard enough to pull the wool over their eyes with a modest and temporary tax break to keep them quiet while at the same time giving tremendous breaks to the elites at the top.  Not sure this is what the middle class expected: https://t.co/gOZIxq7cAW
@FoxNews 1: who cares, she is no longer in government, and	2: still higher that trumps approval rating according to multiple recent polls
@SpeakerRyan Removing the mandate will cause premiums to increase for everyone else purchasing insurance.  When insurance premiums soar in cost, people can't afford to buy healthcare.  Meaning many LOSE healthcare because they used to be able to afford to purchase it and now they can't.
@bobcesca_go Removing the mandate will cause premiums to increase for everyone else purchasing insurance.  When insurance premiums soar in cost, people can't afford to buy healthcare.  Meaning many LOSE healthcare because they used to be able to afford to purchase it and now they can't.
@MarshaBlackburn Removing the mandate will cause premiums to increase for everyone else purchasing insurance.  When insurance premiums soar in cost, people can't afford to buy healthcare.  Meaning many LOSE healthcare because they used to be able to afford to purchase it and now they can't.
@SenatorTimScott Removing the mandate will cause premiums to increase for everyone else purchasing insurance.  When insurance premiums soar in cost, people can't afford to buy healthcare.  Meaning many LOSE healthcare because they used to be able to afford to purchase it and now they can't.
@PressSec @POTUS Removing the individual mandate will cause premiums to soar in cost.  And when premiums soar in cost, people can't afford to buy healthcare.  Meaning people LOSE healthcare because they used to be able to afford to purchase it and now suddenly they can't.
@RBReich @SenatorTimScott And when premiums soar in cost, people can't afford to buy healthcare.  Meaning people LOSE healthcare because they used to be able to afford to purchase it and now suddenly they can't.
@JustinWolfers Facts matter
@CNN Has such an assertion ever been made about a sitting president by such a qualified and experienced security professional?  Amazing. And alarmingly scary. Take heed.
