@LauraWi32702281 Beto should be the 2020 Democrat nominee. Beto is a freshface. If the Democrats nominate Sanders, Warren or Biden (Old White), they will help Trump to win. Need to take Beto seriously because I think he is the only potential Democrat candidate can defeat Trump. But he is a White.

@Sisyphus_ST @asheresque @Sisyphus_smokes If Iran have free elections, no candidates would be disqualified and banned by a Supreme Council.

@asheresque @Sisyphus_ST @Sisyphus_smokes Iran is a great nation since 550 BC when Cyrus the Great established the Persian Empire. He allowed Jews to back to their homeland. Iran was ruled by moderate monarchy until 1979 totalitarian theological Shia Islamic regime took power. It suppress women's rights and civil rights.
@asheresque @Sisyphus_ST @Sisyphus_smokes Many candidates banned in 2013 election. Also @HassanRouhani approved by the Supreme Leader before the election. Iranian "election" cant be compared to the US election. Electoral College is not perfect but popular vote can change the outcome. People can influence in the election.
@asheresque @Sisyphus_ST @Sisyphus_smokes Hillary Clinton is a warmonger. Look at her records on Afghanistan, Iraq, Libya, Syria and Yemen. She supports those wars and never apologize. She will attack Iran if Iran is found to develop nuclear weapons. She won't be hesitated compare to President Obama.
@asheresque @Sisyphus_ST @Sisyphus_smokes Iran democracy is similar to only Catholic priests, Franklin Graham, Jerry Falwell Jr, Jewish Rabbi and other religious leaders form the council to select candidates. According to the Council, candidates need to fit their moral values. Democratic candidates would be disqualified.
@asheresque @Sisyphus_ST @Sisyphus_smokes Iran is a theocracy, not a democracy. The Supreme Council of Iran is formed by religious leaders which select candidates. All candidates need to be approved by the Council. Others are disqualified, banned and arrested. Just because you hate Trump doesn't mean that Iran is better.
@asheresque @Sisyphus_ST @Sisyphus_smokes President Obama dealed with many dictators too like many former presidents. US supported many right-wing anti-communist authoritarian dictators since the Cold War. This is bipartisan foreign policy. Hillary Clinton will do the same thing. She will attack Iran if she is President.

@mark_mean @LorieMunger @sharondoconnor @NYGovCuomo @realDonaldTrump @POTUS Most of abortions come from non-Whites. Whites have birth control. Illegal abortions would increase the birth rate of non-Whites because they would force to carry babies and also many women would die due to unsafe abortions. Legal abortion can reduce the birth rate of non-Whites.
@NYGovCuomo @realDonaldTrump You think women have the right to choose abortion at anytime. Most of the Americans support abortion rights at circumstances but not late term abortions.
@RayneMillaray @sharondoconnor @NYGovCuomo @realDonaldTrump @POTUS So would you support to clarify that late term abortions only for those situations not "all options" under Cuomo's abortion law?
@sharondoconnor @RayneMillaray @NYGovCuomo @realDonaldTrump @POTUS When women may die, she must have the right to save her life. What is c-section? Women have the right to choose in order to save her life, most of Americans agree. The President believe that all lives matter include the unborn, however abortion should be allowed at circumstances.
@NYGovCuomo Most Americans support abortion rights in first three months. But most Americans believe late term abortion is murder.

@ShantanuVashi10 @jasoncoxphoto @AOC @rosadelauro Conservative women focus on family values and respect on women, which Trump is failed. Trump need to improve his attitude on women, not only said with "tremendous respect on women". Also, abortion should not be the main content of his campaign, though I oppose late-term abortion.
@ShantanuVashi10 @AOC @rosadelauro Republicans need more women, same as other conservative parties in other nations. But we won't vote for a politician or an individual just because she is a woman. Voters vote base on her political ideologies and policies.
