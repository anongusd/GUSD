@JcJaneJetson This is a phenomenon that happens because Ischia is a volcano. And the superficiality of the quake localized it to Casamicciola, says RAI.

A10 Lies breed lies when you're talking about big spending or hidden debt. It's financial infidelity #LoveAndMoney
A10 I don't believe in secrets between spouses. #LoveAndMoney
A9 Weddings should really be about love and family and not how much you spend. Don't break the bank #LoveAndMoney
A9 Really, however, many couples - esp older ones - in Italy and the States split the costs of wedding #LoveAndMoney
A9 This depends on your culture. As Italians, the bride's family usually pays. But the men are responsible for providing home. #LoveAndMoney
A8 It depends on the couple, their financial situation, and their needs. They should go when they both see fit. #LoveAndMoney
A7 in fact @DrTerriLoveDr my husband and i have one joint account but the rest is separate, working great #LoveAndMoney
A7 Discuss spending, saving, and budgeting. Also, how much each will contribute #LoveAndMoney
A6 Nix the idealism. Never marry for money but do not think you can live on love alone. #LoveAndMoney
@MMarquit Right, some people get something more humble or not necessarily a diamond. there are other things worth spending on #LoveAndMoney
A5 I feel the guy should buy a ring he thinks is suitable. I realize it's an investment, but it's still a gift #LoveAndMoney
A4 @MMarquit, I agree. Keeping finances mostly separate has worked for my husband and me #LoveAndMoney
A4. Next, they can discuss who owes what, who has what, and who will pay for what #LoveAndMoney
A4. Before delving into who is paying for what, couples should discuss their views on money. Spender v saver? etc. #LoveAndMoney
A3. Of course, love doesn't have to be something you stumble upon. You can pursue it, too. Must change the mentality. #LoveAndMoney
A3. Finances are more definitive. We all need money. We think of love as luxury for those lucky enough to stumble on it. #LoveAndMoney
A2. Love also requires compromise, communication skills, shared values, attraction. It requires 2 people to put in the effort #LoveAndMoney
A2. Fin. success can be about work ethic, determination. To extent, love is like that but there has to be a little magic, too #LoveAndMoney
A1. Another issue would be if they are not open about discussing money in general. #LoveAndMoney
A1. If he/she never wants to chip in or spends too freely, you should beware #LoveAndMoney
