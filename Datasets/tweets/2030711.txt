@KarlBode @EFFFalcon @communitynets @gxsingularity Yup. My concern with the elimination of net neutrality is that the telecoms are basically going to go under because they are larded up with debt, and they will basically become mechanisms to further entrench big tech's power. We need to break up and regulate all of them.
@mediamorphis @communitynets @KarlBode @gxsingularity I'm not sure what a commercial view is. That said, I have read your basic approach to platforms, which amounts to effectively coddling billionaires and state censorship. No thanks.
@KarlBode @communitynets You can argue they seek to become as bad as big tech, which is true. That's how ATT argued to the court in the TW merger. I agree with that. But they haven't demonstrated the capacity to do so, despite their yearning. I do think the combo could happen.
@mediamorphis @KarlBode @gxsingularity That is not an accurate characterization of my views. I think big tech is exceptionally dangerous, whereas telecoms are quite problematic but not an existential threat to democracy. The combination of the two is worse than either one alone.
@KarlBode @gxsingularity @communitynets Look, I respect the argument. I regularly point out Obama was a fraud, and noted that he lied about retroactive immunity in 2008. But these are just not morally equivalent problems, big tech has centralized information flow in historically unique ways.

@KarlBode @gxsingularity You have a long history of great work, but fundamentally, your lack of judgment is dangerous. Call me an ass if you'd like, but I am being clear about why I don't trust your views.
@communitynets @KarlBode @gxsingularity "I'm not sure of all of the implications." --&gt; You literally said you have not thought through the implications, and are now moving on to 'there are no other implications.' You should actually think before making absurd arguments.

3. Only... these electricity and gas markets were deregulated in the 1970s! So these utilities want it both ways. They want a deregulated market with prices swinging wildly, but no antitrust laws to prevent collusion or monopolization. They are regulated! Only not!

@helaineolen The Asian market should open up more space for more competition, but it's inducing less competition and narrower kinds of art. This is all about market structure.
@helaineolen No. Different products. A mid-market rom com can make $10M, but a studio won't care about that amount of money and neither will a 1000 theater chain. A single theater and smaller studio would.
@helaineolen The WGA has the leverage.
@PistolVanBuren @WildBillWellman There is no such thing as best film. It's all subjective.
@helaineolen That's not concentration, it's just PE and corruption. And the writers are going to win.
@helaineolen No, the problem is you have to launch on 4k screens and hit on week one. You can't build slowly through independent movie theaters like you could before the theater roll-ups. Global sales make this dynamic worse but they aren't causal.
@michael_olenick It's high quality branded action franchising designed to sell tickets and recreate studio system constraints on artists. It is what it is. The problem is all the mid-market movies have been wiped out.
@MikeElk Wrong layer of employment. It hires production companies or buys content directly.
@jlrindahl I already said Hollywood is too concentrated. The right way to open up content creation to more voices is to decentralize production and distribution, not centralize it. Netflix is wiping out niche content creation all over the world.
Steven Spielberg may not be a credible messenger, but just take a few moments to think before rushing into the arms of billionaire predators like Netflix and Amazon who are pricing their products below cost to capture control over our ability to tell stories to each other.
This isn't my argument. The problem is that Hollywood is super-concentrated, which is why it's all Marvel movie crap. Netflix and Amazon will only make this problem worse, though it doesn't look like it now because they haven't killed the competition yet. https://t.co/mU0UyK3yRD

@LWinthorpe I agree. Hollywood's problem is excessive centralization of studios and theater chains. More centralization will worsen these dynamics.
@tbarson49 Just ban below cost pricing, not innovating based on profitably serving unmet needs.
@necrofamicom @jwilcox79 Yup
@FCardamenis I agree with this.
Hollywood is structured by a 1948 antitrust decision whose consent decree is still in force. This prevents studios from controlling theaters. Trump's DOJ wants to get rid of it, and Amazon may buy an important indy flick movie theater chain. https://t.co/Bn2BAa67Kt
@LWinthorpe Nah, they churn them out because they sell a lot of tickets that way.
@LWinthorpe Sure.
@DJBentley Steven Spielberg has a commercial interest in movies released in theaters. --&gt; So?
@WGladstone It doesn't.
@WGladstone @SilverEye91 Yeah I know. I'm not being super clear.
@WGladstone @SilverEye91 Netflix isn't doing well because it streams, it is doing well because it is losing billions of dollars by selling below cost. What is not clear about this problem?
What I'm saying is that for all its problems, Hollywood is fairly flexible. But Netflix/Amazon are aiming for a future that is not. They might look good now, but if you want all films produced by one or two billionaire-owned companies by 2025, then cheer on Netflix/Amazon.
@SilverEye91 @WGladstone What I'm trying to say is that if you want all films to be produced by one or two billionaires in 2025, by all means celebrate Netflix and Amazon.
@fredbenenson Netflix is engaged in long-term predatory pricing. It's a corrupt business model that will long-term destroy our ability to produce a diversity of art as a society.
@WGladstone If you want commercially funded art, it makes sense not to have a few monopolies controlling the business. Hollywood produces very good commercially funded art. It is what it is. What Netflix/Amazon have in mind is very different and much worse.
@Chase_Squared No, I'm saying they aren't trying to produce good content. They are trying to kill their competition so they are the only ones remaining standing.
@fredbenenson So enter them into the Emmy awards.
@neogeoist More than half.
@Chase_Squared Netflix isn't a new innovative model. It's just selling below cost.
The Oscars never had meaning as anything but an industry self-celebration. There's no sanctity here to protect. But Hollywood studios do actually have to produce movies that people will buy tickets to see. Netflix and Amazon are just would-be monopolists. https://t.co/56Gwp43qkW

The Oscars aren't about art, they are about business. Hollywood  basically works. There are problems, but it makes movies people like. Netflix and Amazon are fundamentally corrupt and dangerous, and Spielberg is right to use his leverage this way. https://t.co/XE6TgzYZ5o
Netflix isn't gaining market share because they are doing cool innovative things or making good films they are gaining market share because they are losing massive sums of money. It's easy to gain huge share selling below cost with the goal of massively raising prices later.
Netflix and Amazon have business models that do not require them to make money because they are simply trying to capture market power. It is simply not fair competition, it is predatory pricing. Hollywood should protect itself from this predation.
Spielberg is right. Netflix makes TV movies that do not have to make money and they should be eligible for Emmy awards. Netflix does not make movies that have to stand on their own at the box office. https://t.co/yN8tIQNzIG

@joejerome The specifics of your legal framework are a separate question. I'm happy to have that conversation.
@ronivey @Econ_Marshall @jtepper2 I generally oppose focusing on statutory change. The problem is they won't bring cases or do anything. The FTC just voted 3-2 to clear mergers in the dialysis and office supply industries. They just don't believe in enforcement, though the partisan split is getting better.
@joejerome Look, you do what you want, but I'm saying it's a problem that 4 out of 5 witnesses are financed by entities with strong interests in retaining market dominance by vertically integrated data monopolies.
@TonyRomm Great reporting.

The corruption problem with the privacy debate is that it is structured by Google on both sides. Four out of five 'expert' witnesses at this opening hearing are financed by monopoly tech platforms, including the supposedly pro-privacy @CenDemTech. https://t.co/8ybdOFwNbR
@Econ_Marshall @ronivey @jtepper2 Partially, but not entirely. Bork was able to get consumer welfare in the Sherman Act, but merger law is structured by the 1950 Celler-Kefauver amendments to the Clayton Act, and that's not consumer welfare.
The Republican argument against intrusive privacy regulation is basically 'this will help big businesses because small companies can't spend the money on compliance.' This is actually correct. Facebook/Google are a different problem than a small data broker.
@ronivey @Econ_Marshall @jtepper2 It's about focusing policymakers on the problem of monopoly and market structure, and directing them away from a silly focus on econometric nonsense. Here's the court decision. The first page is basically, 'the gov't economist was bad.' He was. https://t.co/pwELnHDJfE
@ronivey @Econ_Marshall @jtepper2 As long as you're agnostic on the tool, yes. For instance, you could easily break up Facebook by using their violation of the 2011 consent decree as leverage, which isn't antitrust law. You could bust a lot of bad practices with Section 5 FTC authority. Not antitrust law.
@taylorgrayson https://t.co/P8C0aZyi0t
@HeidiOBrien8 @janthonylong @markyzaguirre It's not just my preferred policy. Obama and Romney in 2012 were jockeying for 'I will release the most carbon into the atmosphere' crown. https://t.co/P8C0aZyi0t
Remember in 2012 when Obama hit Mitt Romney for being insufficiently supportive of coal as an energy source? I do. https://t.co/HjrUmzzpCU
@Econ_Marshall @ronivey @jtepper2 Perhaps. A lot of this is 'we don't know' because they almost never bring cases. This is the first vertical merger challenge to go to court in 40 years. We have one data point!
The Energy and Commerce Committee has invited 5 witnesses to discuss the Federal privacy legislation, four are financed by Google or Amazon, including both the Republican witness from @AEI and the Democratic witness from the Center for Democracy and Technology. This is a problem.
The behavioral targeting ad lobby chief of the @iab is reading out the names of local American newspapers that can't be reached in Europe. I momentarily forgot whether it's because of privacy laws in Europe or because behavioral targeting is destroying all local newspapers.
@Econ_Marshall @ronivey @jtepper2 I agree that there are certainly precedents that would be helpful to overturn, I just think the more important problem is the philosophy of enforcers who simply do not think antitrust is about creating competitive market structures and so bring very few or very silly cases.
@Econ_Marshall @ronivey @jtepper2 They shouldn't have made the case on consumer prices, but they did. It was a stupid decision and that's just not a problem with the law. https://t.co/3aE0O51jbO
@Econ_Marshall @ronivey @jtepper2 Court cited OMI brief, saying it does not hold "quantitative evidence of price increase is required in order to prevail on a Section 7 challenge. Vertical mergers can create harms beyond higher prices for consumers, including decreased product quality and reduced innovation."
@Econ_Marshall @ronivey @jtepper2 Yes, but on this case, DOJ made the case that ATT-Time Warner merger would raise prices to consumers, and used an expert witness Carl Shapiro who admitted his own model was silly. You can't fix a philosophically and legally inept DOJ with new laws.
@ronivey @Econ_Marshall @jtepper2 No, we don't. Makan Delrahim organized a bad unpersuasive case.

Interesting, @FrankPallone is talking about how data can be used for differential pricing. This is a very important point on how privacy is actually about market structure and manipulating customers.
@JoshuaPauselius @jonfavs @JesseCharlesLee My point is people are comfortable attacking Senators as climate change deniers for doing exactly what Obama did. I'm perfectly comfortable with using the term or not, I'm not comfortable with the double-standard.
Republican @cathymcmorris makes the point that the European data protection law has increased the market share of the big guys and killed innovation by startups.

@DougieGordie A good book on FDR's ideology and the origin of the New Deal is @rauchway's Winter War on the fight between Hoover and FDR during the transition.
@DougieGordie I don't think that's right. FDR was highly ideological and populist from the get-go, and had a general sense of what he wanted to do in 1932.
@DougieGordie Yeah, that's my read. In most of the advisors archives I've read they were quite hostile. There were a few command and control socialist-types around FDR, but their antecedent was Thorstein Veblen and they didn't go in for the class warfare bit.
There's a lot to laud about Eugene Debs. But just because he was a deeply courageous and righteous figure doesn't mean his ideas were always coherent, or that he won or heavily influenced broader political debates.
@tjfxh That might be correct, but it's not what Debs recommended.
@ETTC19 He did. He thought public ownership of monopolists and trusts was the right policy.
It's strange to hear the New Deal's legacy is as a result of Eugene Debs. It just wasn't. It was the populists, not the socialists, who structured the New Deal and most of what we know as social justice frameworks in the U.S. New Dealers generally did not believe in socialism.
"As a socialist, therefore I hail the trust. I view its development with supreme satisfaction... The socialists want the trusts. When they are ripe, the people will be ready, and there will be a change of ownership and operation." - Eugene Debs
I'm not an expert on Debs and maybe he changed or had a varied set of ideas, but here's Eugene Debs mocking those who seek to restrain monopolies and trusts. The 1912 election had two pro-monopolists (TR/Debs) and two anti-monopolists (Wilson/Taft). https://t.co/nTpoGd7wBb
This piece by Jill Lepore on Eugene Debs is fine, but wrong on monopoly. Debs was not a trust-buster, he believed that monopolies were inevitable, and sought public ownership and control of monopolies. https://t.co/wxTAImksJp

Fundamentally, Obama was a bad President, a genuine disaster. A lot of people are starting to get this, tiptoeing around the edge of what this might mean. Hopefully they'll acknowledge it in time to matter policy-wise.

Over and over and over, Congress defers to experts, regulators, the military, national security state, the executive branch with waivers, exceptions, loopholes. If members of Congress want to govern, they should govern with clear, bright-line rules.
For example, to take a non-wall example, in 2010 Congress wanted to cut bank swipe fees on debit cards. Rather than just saying no swipe fee can be higher than .5%, Congress gave power to regulate swipe fee amounts to the Federal Reserve. The Fed just deferred to banks.

19. Last point. Since the crisis of 2008, we've been re-learning our old traditions, that we can do fair commerce free from interference by private banks or monopolists. This was called the New Deal in the 1930s. It's a long process of learning. But we're ten years into it.
18. In the business world, a lot of business people are happy to complain about government regulations, but see complaining about Amazon-imposed (or other forms of monopoly-imposed) regulations as weakness or failure. They are ideologically captured, or scared, or on the take.
17. Different parts of the spectrum get different parts of this dynamic. To over-generalize, the right cares about commerce but doesn't see non-state monopoly power. The left often sees all commerce as coercive, and so wants to regulate and tax crime rather than eliminate it.
16. Anyway, when you really dig into the details of how Amazon, Google, or Facebook make money, it's a mix of technological deployment combined with tying, imposition of unfair terms, gouging, predatory pricing, and other forms of coercion. Not all bad. But a lot of bad.
15. We have a word for what happens when organized crime fully takes over a society. It starts with an F. The way to prevent that is to make sure that we have fair commerce, not coercive commerce, to protect our markets and our communities with democratic institutions.
14. People who want to stop the subsidization of Amazon or want to crack down on monopolistic hospitals that hide their prices aren't anti-business. We are pro-business. We are anti-gangster and anti-organized crime masquerading as business.
13. Redressing inequality, which really just means building liberty in commerce, means stopping the gangster-ification of American business. Jeff Bezos is an incredibly innovative gangster. Martin Shkreli is a gangster. The Sackler family are drug-dealing gangsters. Etc.
12. They have restructured the law by convincing experts that being smart means accepting fancy terms for coercion and then sitting on top of the aristocratic system large-scale criminality produces. The left-leaning ones want to dole out scraps to the poor and call it justice.
11. The Sherman Act of 1890 isn't just a civil statute. It is a *criminal* statute. Monopolization is a *crime.* There are plenty of experts who will say I'm crazy, ignorant, etc. They want the tax and redistribute model. They want to scoop out a few coins and give it to the poor
10. A lot of people get that there's something wrong with low wages matched against a guy worth $150B. But inequality isn't about mismatched numbers on a spreadsheet. The mechanism for transferring the wealth is monopolization, which is a variant of organized criminality.
9. Anyway, Jeff Bezos is worth $150B not because he has a bunch of gold coins in a swimming pool, but because he owns a massive toll booth. Dealing with inequality means you don‚Äôt scoop the gold coins out of the pool and give it to poor people, you blow up the toll booth.
8. Many of our financial and corporate institutions are now built on a legal environment sanctioning coercion and authoritarianism. This is relatively new, only 40 years old. Not only is this not inherent to American commercial traditions, it is rather alien to it.
7. Since the late 1970s, policymakers on the right and left have accepted that power, not liberty, structures commercial arrangements. Predatory pricing, tying, refusals to deal, coercive terms, surveillance, usury, etc - all of these are seen as just business. But they are not.
6. The rise of Amazon directly reflects the intellectual breakdown of the protections we used to ensure that we had free commerce rather than coercive crime masquerading as commerce. This is the genius insight of @linamkhan's paper from 2017. https://t.co/GR28qb6vHX
5. The populist tradition in America, which passed through the revolution to the whiskey rebels and into the 1790s Democratic-Republicans, was oriented to protect free commerce from aristocrats, who used bank charters, tax laws, and monopolies to impose authoritarian conditions.
4. Hundreds of years of this tradition embedded a basic understanding that crime/monopolization and commerce are different. Crime when it becomes dominant in a culture creates aristocracy/authoritarianism. One way to see the American Revolution was a revolt against monopoly.
3. There is a big difference between legitimate commerce, and coercive tactics masquerading as commerce. We have a long tradition of distinguishing between the two, centered around our antitrust laws but extending outward throughout the administrative state and localities.
2. Jeff Bezos built Amazon explicitly around a loophole in the tax code created by the Supreme Court in 1992 that allowed him to skip out on paying sales taxes. It's why he located in Seattle. The tactic was legal, but not technologically driven. Or fair.
1. Ok, let's talk quickly about Amazon and what I'll call the gangster-ification of American business. In the 1980s, mobsters dominated the gas station business in NY and NJ by not paying taxes their competitors had to. https://t.co/HwbJy5UVSL

You rcan do great things from a legislative body. You really can help people. I loved working in Congress. Staffers just reflect American elites in 2019. It's just inherent that way because it's Congress. Our elites are particularly messed up right now. It's not personal.

In 2009 when I started the banking system was collapsing and no one knew how or why. But there was a lot of mean-spirited intimidation to get a shitty Dodd-Frank bill through. Fundamentally it wasn't that staffers were good or bad, it's that we deferred to power instead of truth.
I thought Thomas Friedman was telling the truth about Iraq in 2002. I mean he wrote for the New York Times. That's a good newspaper. The best! And John Kerry supported the war, he was a good liberal. I believed all the serious people. After that I never believed the men in suits.

It's funny when pro-Amazon people are mad at my proposed polling question. 'You didn't include benefits! It won't all go to Bezos! That's not how tax incentives work!' 		It doesn't feel good to be manipulated, does it? So maybe stop pointing at manipulated polling as evidence.
We can argue about all the pros and cons of the Amazon deal. Point being, if you frame a question so the pros are obvious and the cons are vague and technocratic sounding, people will vote pro. If you frame it the other way voters will go that way. It's why polling isn't truth.
Saying 'would you accept great jobs in return for vague-sounding state and city incentives of up to $3 billion' is going to get a high approval. 'would you pay $375 to a billionaire for traffic jams and higher rent' is not. This was not a popular deal.
The polling on Amazon's tax subsidy is silly. If the question were framed differently the deal would be a lot less popular. For instance... "Would you personally pay $375 for each member of your family to Jeff Bezos so he would bring Amazon jobs to New York City?"

10. The FTC breaking 3-2 against a merger challenge is a big deal. It means the law and economics consensus tilting our society towards monopoly has broken down. @RKSlaughterFTC made a number of good points. One is that the FTC should measure what happens after the merger.
9. @RKSlaughterFTC has tried to maintain the historic collegiality of the FTC. But now she's starting to stake out her place in, as she puts it, the ‚Äúgreat debate‚Ä¶ taking place in policy circles and even around the country at family dinner tables‚Äù about corporate power.
8. Two Democrats opposed the acquisition. @RKSlaughterFTC, who has voted with the GOP majority in the past, wrote an important dissent. It can be summarized with, 'are you guys kidding?!?' https://t.co/UIiZy9mi35
7. In America, we have chosen not to have public administrative channels to distribute goods. Instead, we use competitive markets. What the law and economics philosophy has done is to turn these markets into private administrative channels. Now Staples controls its competitors.
6. In this insane and corrupt worldview, the acquisition, rather than concentrating power, is simply making the economy more efficient. Apply this across every sector of the economy, and you'll see why it's increasingly impossible to open or run local businesses.
5. The three GOP FTC commissioners - Christine Wilson, @FTCPhillips @JoeSimonsFTC - argued, and I'm not kidding, that Staples would have no incentive to drive its competitors out of business. Yes. They argued that. https://t.co/ebZ33ufPqs
4. Now every independent office supply store will have to purchase wholesale office supplies from Staples, their biggest rival, which also just became their biggest supplier. It was a 3-2 vote. And the rationale allowing the merger was both cruel and naive.
3. Last month, the Federal Trade Commission decided that Staples, a giant office retailer, could acquire the nation's largest wholesaler of office supplies, Essendant. There are just two big office supply wholesalers. Staples now owns one of them.
2. To run an economy with small businesses, you have to have plumbing that allows small businesses to exist. Distributors that sell in smaller amounts, payment systems, credit, etc. New York City has a lot of bodegas bc this infrastructure exists. Most U.S. areas don't.
1. Ok, here's a quick thread on a simple question that seems apolitical but isn't. How easy is should it be to open and run an independent store? Late last month, the Republicans on the FTC gave their answer. They decided independent stores should die.
@Burrite Yup, I find the right far more interested in questions of commerce.

@josephflaherty @jdh @benedictevans Thanks for the tip. I've rarely heard him talk when he isn't spouting a pro-Google line, but I'll give him another listen.
@jdh Sure. And one thing I didn't say but implied is that this is happening across many sectors of the economy. Exits to the big guys are a strategy in many sectors. It's not the only way to exit, it's just an important one.
@benedictevans And then you said that I said all VCs are pivoting to China, which I didn't say. Look, you're a smart guy, but you use your intelligence to win high school debate contests and that's not something I'm interested in.
@jdh @benedictevans Thanks, that's helpful.
@jdh There's a basic revulsion towards politics within American business culture, a feeling that talking to policymakers about market structure reflects weakness and failure. This isn't true of the hyper-success monopolists.
@jdh Those are fair points. Some VCs, like some business leaders, get that the game is rigged. Of that group, many just knuckle under to the cartel. Others complain privately. Most however just think they can compete and try to do that without looking to politics.
@jdh @benedictevans I'm not attacking you, I'm listening to you. 		(Benedict is well-known troll, I don't care what he says. He may have expertise, but as you can tell from his misrepresentation of my point, he's not engaged in a good faith discussion.)
@jdh @benedictevans Acqui-hires wouldn‚Äôt be affected, I think the threshold is $50M+ firms.
@jdh Ok. Fair enough. My private conversations with VCs are very different. There is a climate of fear.
@benedictevans No one said they are all pivoting to China. Knock off the trolling.
@jdh Ok. Then you shouldn‚Äôt care about the Klobuchar bill.
@benedictevans Then there‚Äôs no reason for you to care about the Klobuchar bill.
Any politician who criticizes Google, Facebook, or Amazon by name and on monopoly grounds is standing up to power. https://t.co/jfdWaI7dax
It would reorient investment capital, which is now controlled by a quasi-cartel across the economy. VCs are afraid to speak out, or they are just focused on selling their portfolio companies to big tech, or they are going to China. Breaking this cartel would be big.
Klobuchar's bill saying big companies can't acquire small ones would break big tech's control over venture capitalists. VCs would have to invest in companies that compete with big tech instead of trying to build companies to be acquired by them.
Klobuchar was *extremely* skeptical of the FTC's quick approval of the Amazon-Whole Foods merger. https://t.co/tfxBlTPIqJ
Little noticed part of @amyklobuchar's career is she is the top Democrat on the Senate Antitrust Subcommittee. While she hasn't made huge waves she has one exceptional 'silver bullet' proposal. One of her bills would bar big companies ($100B+ market cap) from making acquisitions.

"The wall Spotify can put up around podcasts is much stronger than the one it can put up around music, and podcasters have fewer alternatives. Or, to put it another way, podcasts are a market where Spotify ‚Äî to the extent they are willing to pay ‚Äî actually has power over supply."
Podcasting "will, in other words, look like everything else touched by the Internet: very large winners on one end, and small niche winners on the other." 		The middle tier of podcasters will be wiped out.
Podcasting is the *only* media market that works because no one entity controls the advertising market and Apple has a benign neglect approach to using its dominant podcast app to exploit podcasters. This roll-up by Spotify could be a huge deal.

@kevinschawinski @zeynep The analogy is good but not quite accurate. User data isn't used to expropriate user property but bargaining leverage by publishers. It's more like asking me to consent to protecting the property of someone I don't know in return for being inconvenienced.

Whatever you think about how much people care about the free press or democracy, they certainly care far far less about the financing and distribution of the advertising messages they receive.
It's super weird how there are just so many arguments against the business models of FB and Google, and basically the only argument for those models is 'yeah but consumers REALLY want relevant ads.' Seems a bit of a stretch.
When you push on why Google and Facebook have to structure their business in harmful ways the answer always comes back to 'consumers want advertising that is relevant to them.' Really? They want targeted ads more than democracy?

@marciahofmann @blakereid @SteveBellovin It‚Äôs Google and Facebook who control advertising, with Amazon as a rapidly emerging actor. That‚Äôs it. Those three. The solution is simple. You can‚Äôt be a common carrier and run an ad business. Easy.

@antoniogm @fmanjoo @nbashaw @CodyBrown @pt @mathewi @kubakostecki @RrjohnR The post office was organized by the continental congress in 1775 because newspapers were understood as essential to national security!

@fmanjoo @antoniogm @nbashaw @CodyBrown @pt @mathewi @kubakostecki This centralization of information and ad revenue is not so much a reversion to the mean as its a reversion to feudalism.

@Atrios Yes. Start by breaking hospital and pharma pricing, which will bring massive benefits upfront to the 90% of people that already have insurance, as well as benefitting those who don't.
@march4progress You can do universal health care in many different ways.
@Atrios Basically do a good job and people will support you. I agree with that. I just don't think it's easy to pass something that's complex and scary whose costs are frontloaded and whose benefits are backloaded, especially when the last Dem who did it fucked it up.

Medicare for All is more a slogan than a plan. Most Americans face cost problems, not insurance access. The response is Medicare for All can take on provider cost. It can, depending. But why not... take on provider monopolies first? That's the access problem 90% of people face.
Insulin is overpriced bc of monopolies. The government can take care of the problem *right now* without any expansion of coverage. Both cost/universal insurance can be addressed together, but as we've seen with the ACA, that's not inherent.
@jbenton It would be far too expensive to run a real survey. You would have to ask people about local events, economic events, and events in a bunch of different industries.

@jdcmedlock @tk1anon @Undorkins To some extent, this is just an argument about the right order. I just think that breaking the market power of providers should take place first.
@reesed91 @MattBruenig It's a better strategy to break their power and then universalize since the majority of people will see the benefits of cost controls immediately whereas M4A benefits will take a few years and require a lot of scary changes in the interim.
@tk1anon @jdcmedlock @Undorkins Military industrial complex is the nightmare scenario. Medicare is overpriced but better than private insurance. And the VA is even better! The point is, *think* about bargaining power.
@MattBruenig There are many other reasons why buying high cost bad quality care is problematic aside from political power. It starts with, people won't like it if they have to buy high cost bad quality care.
@MattBruenig The US could not cut unit costs at all and still give everyone access. That's how rich we are. --&gt; No, the billionaires and millionaire leeches you leave in place would quickly lobby and destroy quality of care and universality. You don't get power, you never have.
@Michael35290793 @MattBruenig I'd be fine nationalizing the whole provider system, like the VA or NHS. I'm also fine with lots of trust-busting and/or administrative pricing. I'm not fine with unregulated private monopolies with pricing power. They will kill people for money.
@MattBruenig Plenty of people have health insurance and no health care. Without addressing cost you don't solve access, and cost is the hard part, not access. Gov't can pencil in cost schedules now, and doesn't. So you're pushing for high cost low quality bad outcomes.
@Undorkins @tk1anon They are doing that now. You do realize they lobby on Medicare rates.
@MattBruenig Seems like you prefer high prices and low quality, since you criticize the notion we should try to get low prices and high quality.
@tk1anon Does this work with the military industrial complex?
In other words, the best way to go forward is to start with breaking up provider and pharma monopolies through both trust-busting and administrative pricing (like forcing providers to take Medicare prices). Costs come down. Then use that credibility with universalization.
It's possible Medicare for All would push down health care prices. Very possible. It's also possible it won't. Has a single payer for weapons kept costs in the military industrial complex down?
@mcyost What has a monopsony on purchasing weapons done to weapons prices?
@MattBruenig I'm trying to understand why you prefer a universal system with high prices and low quality to a universal system with low prices and high quality.
If you're interested in why I am concerned about focusing too much on single payer without thinking through the cost-monopoly side of providers, here's @LongmanPhil's piece. Think about the bad single payer system known as the military industrial complex. https://t.co/vl8RfkCmsH
The Democratic primary needs to be a debate, an argument, over how to address the serious imbalance of power in this country. It is going to be heated and bitter. That's ok. We have big problems. And/or big opportunities. A better world awaits.
My concern over Kamala Harris is the same as my concern over much of the field. Where's the track record of taking on concentrated financial power? It's a fixable problem, as naming names like Amazon, Monsanto, and Google goes a long way. Please, no fake scandals.
Kamala Harris has not shifted her position on Medicare for All. She's for it, and for stuff that moves in that direction. Important not to gin up fake scandals. I have mixed feelings on M4A, the access problem is about provider price gouging not insurance. https://t.co/sPP10tazrh

Alexander Hamilton is a fascinating historical figure. The Newburgh Conspiracy where he tried to organize a military overthrow of Congress to help wealthy holders of Federal debt is really important but no one seems to know about it. Baffling.
I find the lack of interest in Hamilton's authoritarianism really weird. In the late 1790s Hamilton created the only partisan army in U.S. history and attempted to make himself a military dictator. That's super interesting. Like we almost had a Napoleon! https://t.co/cs81j6Ao6z

15. This Democratic culture of deference must end. It simply must. We do not have time for this anymore. We get one more shot at governing, and if we screw that up like we did the Obama administration, we'll get a competent authoritarian. It'll be over.
14. I feel shitty writing this. I *like* Jason Furman. I don't think he would write his paper on Walmart today. He has done good for the world. I don't think he's corrupt. But he *did* write it, when it mattered, it was wrong, it *did* cause harm and it *did* help Walmart.
@RevClown Exactly like Iraq
13. I spend a lot of time on the Obama administration, but it's really an intellectual edifice that goes back to Clinton and the 1980s. We have to end this mindset, that being wrong but in the consensus on behalf of the powerful confers credibility. We have to change.
12. What's going on with @AOC and Furman is party disciplining, a 'don't go after your own side' attack. An irrelevant difference, conflating whether the paper was directly or indirectly sponsored, is grounds for such discipline. Over time, this accumulates into a reputation.
11. I wrote this piece to describe these dynamics. https://t.co/bdB4p25i5R
10. So you know, just by saying this about Furman and Brookings, I have harmed my career. This is how DC works. People are going to talk about how I'm [pick an insult or character smear] because I believe you deserve the right to know how your democracy is really organized.
9. Being on Walmart's side in 2005-2006 conferred substantial advantages, especially career advancement within the Democratic economics apparatus. Today, Furman - who was wrong - is an important figure, while his opponents - who were correct - are not.
8. Don't just take my word for it. Fed officials were saying it. "Wal-Mart is in the process of raising starting wages... some of the raises are  part of the Wal-Mart, I‚Äôll call it ‚ÄúSocial/political‚Äù agenda because of  all the controversy about Wal-Mart." https://t.co/EWgJ5o6MEI

@henryfarrell That's fair. I'll explain where I'm coming from. I don't disagree that there are genuinely and sincerely held ideas. I do disagree about formulating neoliberalism around trying to make markets work. Neoliberalism is about trying to make monopolies work, it's Bull Moose-ism.
5. @SenWarren picked a big fight with Brookings over this in 2015, attacking a Brookings 'scholar' who attacked a consumer protection rule. This is common at Brookings. They defend the powerful. https://t.co/BIqtAFfOtR

3. But the debate over Walmart, and the institutional circles he moved in, were deeply destructive. At the time, the Hamilton Project at Brookings was just starting up. Hamilton was Wall Street tycoon Robert Rubin's holding pen for what would become the Obama economics team.
2. First, I like Furman. He has done good work on some important topics. He worked to protect the safety net, and his observations about superstar firms in 2016 were pivotal to moving the debate over concentration in certain circles. And he isn't corrupt.
1. So talking Jason Furman for a sec, because @AOC criticized a paper he wrote in 2005 titled "Wal-Mart: A Progressive Success Story" as sponsored by Walmart and she's getting blowback for it. Let me just offer a couple of observations about what is and isn't fair.
There is zero chance that today Furman defends his 2005 paper ‚ÄúWal-Mart: A Progressive Success Story.‚Äù Being an intellectual means admitting you erred when you err. He erred. Has he admitted it? Why are you defending his errors? https://t.co/RgfzNiP6kB
Jason Furman ran the Hamilton Project at Brookings, which is a damn slush fund for corporate money. Enough defending this system of intellectual malfeasance as if money isn‚Äôt fungible and prime actors are totally innocent and pure. https://t.co/RgfzNiP6kB

Vladeck,a former FTC official, said a breakup is ‚Äúnot going to  happen‚Äîthat‚Äôs an antitrust remedy.‚Äù Fines could reach considerable levels as a way of sending a message to the industry. ‚ÄúA nice round  number like $1 billion would do it,‚Äù Mr. Vladeck said.		Joke.

@aemccarthy Scoffing at "the old bastards in Congress" - aka our democratically elected representatives - is disdainful of democracy. Zuckerberg was just lying, but the hearings were nonetheless good. Tech reporters don't understand Congress, but lavished praise on Zuck for dishonesty.
Conservatives should be freaking out over these tech monopolies. Politicians will easily weaponize Facebook, Google, and Amazon as private governing forces. This is an unimaginable level of power when you fuse corporate information monopolies and state apparatus.
@aemccarthy Yes. The tech press is just corrupt and disdainful of democracy.
@aemccarthy Congress did well during the hearings.
It's also important to note that there is no ethical way to run a search engine that has advertising on it. This isn't just what I think. Google co-founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin made this point ***when they set up Google.***
American politics has *always* been based on the ease of starting a newspaper financed by advertising and subsidized by the Post Office's open network structure, from the early 1800s onwards. We created the Post Office in 1775 as part of a national security crisis! This is weird!
Every ad-based model has failed because Google, Facebook, and Amazon are stealing all the ad money. The entrepreneurial model with talented creative executives and journalists failed. Local newspapers with legacies failed. Deep-pocked Verizon with a mobile network sites failed.
I don't think people get how insane it is that everyone has a supercomputer with an insanely powerful camera in their pocket connected to a worldwide information grid, and yet somehow no one can figure out how to build a sustainable media business.
The FTC is totally useless. It's time for Congress to act, and just draw lines in legislation. No targeted ad business if you are an essential communications facility. Google would divest its adtech business lines. Explosion in creativity, entrepreneurship and journalism.
Markets are political structures. We‚Äôve designed our markets to prioritize the power of Google, Facebook, and Amazon instead of enabling a free press and shielding that press from govt influence through advertising. Bad choice. Reversible! https://t.co/8keef57BJR

@SethHanlon Obama could have closed the subpart F loophole administratively, but did not. He could have refused to allow large bank settlements to be tax deductible, but did not. There are endless pieces throughout the tax code like this. I haven't combed through them bc it's not my area.
@SethHanlon Actually my underlying claim is that Obama is ideologically in favor of plutocracy.
@kcm74 Wilson probably had a series of strokes in 1918 and his judgement began failing. Before 1918 he was a remarkably good flexible politician who got more legislation through Congress than anyone since Lincoln.

@glenweyl @ReutemannTim @AOC @lionel_trolling Yes, I oppose arbitrary seizures of property based on the desire of a game theorist enthusiast to engage in social tinkering. My view is property conveys rights and responsibilities, and democracy is not reducible to financialization where the numerate exercise political control.
@broggle12 @mattyglesias I am bad! And Obama was morally fine with billionaires and massive wealth inequality!
@Bouje99 @AOC https://t.co/E4AYZE8P2v		 ""I know both those guys; they are very savvy businessmen... I, like most of the American people, don't begrudge people success or wealth. That is part of the free- market system."
And yes I'm aware the ACA raised capital gains rates a bit. Does that make up for the massive increase in inequality that happened from 2009-2017 as a direct result of bailout policies and amnesty for white collar crime? No.
Mildly suggesting slightly higher taxes on the super-wealthy in a budget proposal after bailing out the superrich is not serious. It's like saying you want to stop foreclosures but working the policy to encourage foreclosures, which Obama also did. https://t.co/xY0wiJHDEy

If you want more information, read @EileenAppelbaum's Private Equity at Work, check out @yvessmith's reporting on the PE industry, and pay attention to @davidsirota's reporting on pensions. This is a multi-trillion scam. It's horrific. https://t.co/j6ph0qYJuO
We probably need straightforward caps on media ownership acquired via merger. You can build a chain if you build it, but not if you buy it. We also need far more assertive rules forcing PE companies to disclose fees charged to investors and public rules on pensions.
This is going to have to be done industry by industry. It's probably a good idea to have much stronger barriers to moving IP and medical facilities in mergers. Martin Shkreli for instance was essentially a PE guy profiting by extorting sick people. That's common.
We have to figure out how to eliminate the evil looting of PE while retaining the ability to invest in productive expansion of businesses. We need changes to tax laws, much higher marginal tax rates, and more assertive antitrust. Bring back state-level anti-takeover statutes.
There are an endless number of scams, most oriented around self-dealing and monopoly power to spreading horrible business practices throughout the economy. One PE company I heard of bought a pharma biz and tried to extend patents by patenting an FDA warning label!
The money used by PE is pension fund money, but these pension funds have little access to info on fees charged by PE and the contracts are often secret. @yvessmith has been exposing how CALPERS is suckered into these arrangements. They are using OUR money to wreck OUR companies.
You can also make money by controlling the company, having the company borrow a ton of cash, and paying that cash to yourself. Or to consulting firms you control. And remember, you bought it with borrowed money. So none of the risk is borne by the person in control.
There are incentives that encourage the PE model. You used to be able to write off borrowing costs. That ended with the Trump tax cut. But you still have a lower tax rate for PE 'income' known as the carried interest loophole. We subsidize destroying of businesses.
PE is, put simply, the use of other people's money in unregulated pools to buy and restructure corporations for profit. You can make money by either making the company work better, but that's hard and boring. It's easier to make big bucks by looting. Layoffs are one model.
In the 1980s, what Simon did was systemized into a business called leveraged buy-outs. It was renamed 'private equity' because the name leveraged buy-out because so toxic. KKR was the big one, but there were others. Now there are lots of shops targeting every kind of company.
The answer was simple, no different than what Brandeis discussed 70 years earlier. He borrowed against the assets of the company, sold off the company's assets, and paid himself handsomely. It was a form of looting. If you had access to Other People's Money, you could do it.
Modern PE was born in the 1980s by former Nixon Treasury Secretary, William Simon. Simon bought Gibson greeting cards in 1981 with only $330k of his own cash down. He sold it in 18 months and made $70M. Wall Street's mouth collectively watered. How. The. Fuck. Did. He. Do. That?

Hardest thing for Dems to hear is that many rural voters resent them for completely legitimate reasons. It was Democratic heroes and icons, like Tom Vilsack, who badly hurt farmers by shifting power to big ag. It's not the whole story, but it's part of it. https://t.co/N8IzQ40K6F
Obama promised to take on rural monopolists and then broke his promise. I often get asked 'be specific about what he did wrong.' That's hard, there's too much to track. Obama pretty much shifted power and wealth to the powerful in every single sector. https://t.co/N8IzQ40K6F

Obama was driven by his pathological fear of embarrassment, which he wrote about in Audacity of Hope. FDR lost the use of his legs, and found an emotional security and depth few leaders have. https://t.co/GIf3flUfDr
Also, it's important as citizens to recognize that we change. I have different views today I did ten years ago. I've read different books, had different experience, recognized new problems, lived more of life. We do not have to know all the answers or be right all the time.
It's bad to attack a problem with an old solution. We should not act like China is a low wage country seeking offshoring of goods made with low skilled labor when it is a dangerous expansionist high tech fascist state. Or see the problem with Amazon as low wages of its workers.
Not really, no. FDR screwed up all the time. One key difference between FDR and Obama is FDR was willing to learn and change. Obama's view was, and this is a direct quote: "Our policies are so awesome. Why can't you guys do a better job selling them?" https://t.co/Io9TLDqg34
In 2008 the avg insured family of four paid $15k/year for health care. Last year it was $30k. It's ok to say 'I thought Obamacare was worth a shot but I realized it didn't get the job done.' The world is different. Surprise billing didn't really exist in 2008. It's ok to change.
There's something weird about a demand that politicians remain static in their views when the world doesn't. China is a very different problem today than it was 10 years ago. So are tech monopolists. And banks. Etc. https://t.co/sEodylKV02

I don't spend much time criticizing the GOP because Republican insiders are fundamentally nihilists. Their philosophy truly is impervious to criticism because they just don't believe in enlightenment principles. They are open-minded and curious, but from a nihilistic posture.
Democratic insiders actually think they are trying to do good for the world. Republicans insiders don't really believe doing good for the world is a thing. They admire well-done lies and theft. For them it's a form of art. Republicans are mean white sorority girls.
No, Republicans don't fool themselves the same way. They want to wield power, and they believe in aristocracy, so it's both less and more honest. More honest in that it's just about greed, less honest in that truth is just not important. It's all a game. https://t.co/mXJmbTsB6x

This is why Kamala Harris can tout the foreclosure record of the Obama administration. It actually required some detailed knowledge and thinking to see what happened, and Dems have hated thinking since the 1980s.

So much of the 'we must get along' and process-talk and calls for unity are just about laziness. Writing law is hard! It requires boring detailed work fighting with fancy people who sneer at you. It's much easier to pretend to wonk out than to actually do it.

Even today lots of Democratic voters just do not believe you when you say Obama's policy was to have a foreclosure wave and not prosecute top Wall Street bankers. It's not that they disagree, they just cannot even imagine it. Cognitive dissonance is profound. Super weird.
@retheauditors It's not the result of rising to power, these people are recruited to run because they are like this.
Yup. It's not just the House, though that is the most infected part of the party. It extends down to more than half of Dem voters. Older Dem voters despise intraparty conflict and see themselves as personally left-wing while voting against left-wingers. https://t.co/RgW7uCXFmc
This isn't just a corporate donor thing, it's a culture. People like @sethmoulton and Tim Ryan were in part rebelling against Pelosi as a statement that it is just annoying to have so many out of touch thin-skinned dork weirdos as co-workers. Remember, this is their job.
There's this insane conflict-aversion. You only get to have an opinion if you are a 75 year annoying weirdo who obsessed over model UN in high school and is surrounded by yes-men eager to become lobbyists. Otherwise you don't understand the GOP are bad. https://t.co/Nmjuncacv2
And to a large extent this isn't the fault of most of these people. It just messes you up psychologically to have to write law as a member of the Party of the People while also doing so without disturbing anyone who is powerful. It turns you into someone angry at all non-liars.
There are a lot of staffers and ex-staffers who have stories about this and know exactly what I mean. This is particularly true for the post-2008 period, when the Dem leadership fully embraced the bailouts and the GOP did not.
I don't want to contribute to the @AOC obsession in the media, and of course she and her people have things to learn. Writing law isn't simple. But she's a great touchstone to show how so many Dem establishment people are just wildly out of touch. There need to be mass layoffs.
‚ÄúIt totally pissed off everyone,‚Äù said one senior House Democratic lawmaker of the campaign. ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt get picked for committees by who your grass-roots [supporters] are.‚Äù &lt;--- Dems have institutionalized hatred of their external supporters. Party of the people!
Of course there's sniping she hired @saikatc as her chief of staff, because controlling staff culture is incredibly important. In 2009 Dems couldn't believe that my boss hired me because I had *no hill experience.* Which is code for 'he doesn't know tolerating bribery is fine.'
‚ÄúI think she needs to give herself an opportunity to know her  colleagues and to give herself a sense of the chemistry of the body  before passing judgment on anyone or anything,‚Äù said Rep. Yvette Clarke &lt;-- Why should anyone have opinions about anything?
‚ÄúThe honeymoon between the voters that you represent and yourself could be a short one. People want to see results.‚Äù &lt;--- This is just insane. Establishment Dems think they have just done a bang-up job for decades and that @AOC is popular just because she has a Twitter account.
‚ÄúWashington is a political animal where a lot of the work that you  want to accomplish depends on relationships within the Democratic  Caucus,‚Äù said Vel√°zquez &lt;-- This is exactly what voters hate.

@JBSDC @Aintropy It's not an issue of disagreement, you are just wrong. You are conflating the committees likely to see action with the House hierarchy. Oversight is NOT a tier one committee, and Approps is not a second tier one. Freshmen do not get on Approps and they do get on Oversight.
@JBSDC Also Ways and Means is going to handle NAFTA.
@JBSDC This isn't opinion. It's how the House organizes itself. You can argue politicians might want to be on a different committee, I'm just telling you the ones freshmen do not get on.
Powerful committees are Ways and Means (taxing), Appropriations (spending), and Energy and Commerce (regulating industry). Freshmen don't get on those. Second tier are Judiciary, Ed and Labor, and Financial Services. Freshmen often get on those. https://t.co/PzERs4mAPY

There are five lawyers (or fewer) on the FTC investigation of Facebook. This is an agency that has been shut down for years, decades even.
Oh no the Facebook 'investigation' by the FTC has been shut down! Now Facebook might be able to do anything it wants without any constraints whatsoever. It could turn into a nightmare, with Mark Zuckerberg worth $50 billion by allowing meddling in elections. That would suck!
One reason people don't care as much about the gov't shutdown as they might is because key parts of government, like the FTC, have been effectively shut down for decades. So why would people notice? https://t.co/KWjoJMccar
@m4h007 That was in 2016, and it was a good case to bring. Staples-Office Depot tried to merger in the 1990s. The problem is the FTC should bring a case against Amazon, not allow remaining parties to become monopolies.
According to the FTC's 2017 HRC report, the commission blocked one merger in 2017, FanDuel - DraftKings. One. The rest of the mergers the FTC 'challenged' it later allowed through, with some concessions. The FTC doesn't have enforcers, it has deal-makers. https://t.co/ZxP76tQPpk

I come back to Louis Brandeis: "If we desire respect for the law, we must first make the law respectable." The FTC has lost the right to respect. Respect can be regained, but it's not obvious whether the commission at this point is modestly useful or actively harmful.

@David_desJ No, my argument is twofold. One, the hype around self-driving cars ended up shuffling resources in inefficient and foolish ways. Two, this hype was driven by people operating according to incentives designed to sideline reasonable skeptics.
@David_desJ For example, a much simpler way to address problems with our transportation system would be to fix our train system, rebuild the Hudson Tunnel, and rebuild our merchant marine. These aren't a passion projects of a tech giant nor is it something that financiers get excited about.
@David_desJ There's now massive investment capital and buy-in around autonomous vehicles, and that is likely to have important (and not necessarily positive) impacts even though the original arguments were based on fantasy. None of this is due to Page's passion, it's speculative fervor.
@David_desJ Maybe they didn't know level 5 was impossible &amp; lied about their uncertainty. Maybe they did know it was impossible but sought to persuade public officials to invest in infrastructure to accommodate level 2-4 vehicles. Maybe they were wrong and wouldn't listen to skeptics.
@David_desJ I don't understand your question.

@AshleyBaloghNM That's assuming the trillion dollar behemoth doesn't have market power which it uses to block new entrants.
As a simple example, Netflix can toss $5 million into a project as just part of the portfolio of a random executive copycatting some other generic content. By contrast, if 5 independent filmmakers had $1M each they would damn sure pay close attention to what they created.
One of the reasons to break up $100B+ revenue companies is because a massive institution that has to grow at 10-15% overlooks a lot of "smaller" profitable opportunities. But these "smaller" opportunities are big in an absolute sense and very important.
Large tech platforms have to grow at percentages that are impossible at large scale unless you go into massive new markets. This was the reason behind both the self-driving car hype and Google's moonshot frame, not some desire to help humanity. https://t.co/5eFLWFokge

@SubGrew Yup, that‚Äôs Henry Simons and his ‚ÄòPositive Program for Laissez Faire.‚Äô
@SubGrew Correct, it was a mixed system. Keep in mind that the private banks were quite regulated so it was private money creation via public rules directing that money into certain channels.
23. Anyway if you're interested in the procedural and ideological disputes, I wrote it up here. Suffice to say, I think this argument was a big deal and will reverberate in important ways for decades. https://t.co/xNs4kXizuL
22. It's a scary debate, bc most politicians (and people) are not confident in their policy judgment or ability to wrestle with ideas when men in suits with PhD's tell them they are wrong. But @AOC, @RoKhanna, @RepJayapal, and @MarkPocan had the policy confidence to do that.
21. The real question is who gets to create money, which is a political commodity underlying our markets, our commercial society, and our social relationships. A small elite of economists and bankers? Or the democracy? That is the actual debate.
20. Paul Krugman makes this argument. He says too much debt in the long-term is bad, but the Republicans are bad faith operators so it's not worth constraining Democratic priorities. His argument is wrong. #PayGo isn't bad purely for political reasons. https://t.co/fAadxUNWki
19. There were bitter arguments about the best way to eliminate this rule, called #PAYGO, but they all agreed in the need to get rid of it. It's not 100% clear that Democrats understand the reason to do so. Some think #PayGo stops them from spending money on nice things.
18. Last week, two Democrats, @AOC and @RoKhanna, refused to go along with this argument. They said they would vote down a House Rule with a provision requiring balanced budgets. Others, like @RepJayapal and @MarkPocan, agreed but cut a deal with Pelosi to weaken the rule.
17. The argument for balanced budget orthodoxy is essentially a giant intimidation game by men in suits. "No credible economist thinks that you can run big deficits forever..." or "long-term our debt is going to get us" kind of deal. No. We've had a national debt for 200+ years.
16. Both parties are largely in thrall to balanced budget orthodoxy, aka a belief the only legitimate creator of money is Wall Street. Trump is less so. He knows instinctively he can run the printing press and hand it to wealthy cronies. It's a corrupt view, but not wrong.
15. It's not bad to print money. It's necessary. The question is who does it? The democracy, aka a mix of our government through deficits and a regulated private financial system? Or purely Wall Street? This is the essence of the debate that happened this week over #PAYGO.
14. This isn't some conspiratorial framing. Here's a video of Ben Bernanke saying the Fed printed money to bailout the banks. https://t.co/zLt86VUntx
13. What made private financiers able to print money wasn't just the removal of public removals, but successively larger bailouts by government. The gov't spending and taxing authority, no longer used for public social priorities, was quietly placed in service of financiers,
12. Private money creation was unshackled by removing public rules on private financiers, known inaccurately as 'deregulation.' Public institutions were no longer allowed to spend money without permission from financiers, aka deregulated bond and derivatives market.
11. In the 1970s and 1980s, Wall Street took this power back from the public. They put in place a new gold standard. This is, of course, balanced budget orthodoxy and the argument that public money printing in the form of a large national debt led a nation to bankruptcy and ruin.
10. Public money printing by FDR was paired with a radical restriction on private money printing by banks. Credit controls and regulations stopped banks from creating money. That's how inflation was kept low and banking power crushed. There was also direct price controls.
9. During World War II, the government "printed" money by running deficits as large as 25% of GDP, roughly equivalent to $4 trillion today. FDR ordered the Federal Reserve to peg interest rates at 2%. Inequality collapsed as the U.S. served as the arsenal of democracy.
8. The debate continued in the form of a contest over the gold standard in the 19th century (w/the 'Cross of Gold' speech by William Jennings Bryan in 1896). FDR finally repudiated the gold standard in 1933 and regulated the banks. The public took control of money printing.
7. 'The Democracy' was something of an epithet in the 1790s, a sort of radical term similar in some ways to Communist in the 1950s. The founding of the Democratic-republican Party was a response to Hamilton's creation of Wall Street in the form of a privately owned national bank.
6. The founding era was rife with monetary debates. Alexander Hamilton sought to place money creation power in private hands, hence he's the founder of Wall Street. @WilliamHogeland's Founding Finance is about this. So is Terry Bouton's Taming Democracy. https://t.co/6LJ5BULKYb
5. America has a long and contested history over who gets to create money. Benjamin Franklin was a strong proponent of paper money printed by the states. The rich hated Franklin for it. States would print money by creating public land banks and lending it against farm mortgages.
4. There are two ways to print money. Banks print money every time they make a loan. That's private money creation. And the government prints money when it runs a deficit (when it spends more than it taxes.) To simplify, both the government and Wall Street can print money.
3. The value of money is essentially the amount of money in circulation versus how much stuff the economy produces. If you have a bigger economy you need more money to match that increased trade. Money is permission to use resources, the more resources the more money you need.
2. Money is a very weird thing. It is at heart a commodity that a group agrees is a medium of exchange. What gives money value is both a collective belief it does, and an enforcement trigger, ie taxing authority. Dollars have value bc the U.S. gov't collects taxes in dollars.
1. Ok, a quick thread on what I think was a very significant ideological fight that happened last week. The dispute was over something known as #PayGo and while it appeared to concern boring government budgeting questions, it is actually about the nature of money and democracy.

5. Anyway all of this is just process talk, and process doesn't really matter. What is important is to break the balanced budget orthodoxy, which basically everyone on the Democratic side now wants to do. #PAYGO
4. So the argument is 'we'll do #PAYGO and waive it on "progressive priorities." That's what @RepJayapal and @MarkPocan got. It's a good deal. Progressive priorities is a fuzzy term. But the underlying problem is the law, not the rules package. Here: https://t.co/xNs4kXizuL
3. Now, it doesn't mean Congress has to balance budgets. It just has to go through a #PAYGO process, and explicitly waive it on each bill. Then the White House doesn't get power to do spending cuts. It's a dumb law. Democrats were dumb in 2010.
2. But the anger at the House Rules package is based on a misunderstanding of process and law. In 2010, Obama and a Dem Congress passed a law that basically forced Congress to go through a #PAYGO process. If Congress, doesn't, then the White House gets to make spending cuts.
1. Basically here's the deal with #PAYGO. Balanced budget obsessiveness is bad, because in reality it turns into an ideological chokepoint for neoclassical economists to veto what elected lawmakers were elected to do. So this #PAYGO fight is good in that sense.
Basically some things are fights over ideological, some things are fights over strategy, and some things are fights because factions misunderstand and miscommunicate. The #PAGO dispute is the latter. https://t.co/xNs4kXizuL

@FillinghamLydia Communist
The Congressional Budget Office is highly ideological. It *should* be ideological. But just split it up into a Democratic CBO and a Republican CBO and have the argument explicitly. Don't dress it up in technocratic clothing and pronounce a bunch of financiers the voice of God.
And who advises CBO about its health care models? Let's see. A board member of Eli Lilly. An SVP of Blue Cross. A partner at #BigLaw firm Jones Day. An exec at the Hospital Corporation of America. An EVP at UnitedHealth Group. https://t.co/7XkedWWZam

The endpoint of Wright's goal is child labor, the end of safety standards, etc. After all anything that allows workers to bargain over conditions or exclude entrants, he thinks, is an injury to consumers. One wonders how he would have thought about labor conditions in 1855.

@WGladstone No, Sorry to Bother blames voters for being stupid and does not include politicians. It‚Äôs a dystopia that mostly erases free will.
I don‚Äôt recommend attacking Obama if you want Democratic votes. It‚Äôs just that he did a bad job and so getting Democratic votes requires not being straightforward about that.

Most of these ‚Äòproblems‚Äô were not created by Warren, but are a result of a Democratic Party that is institutionally incapable of honest assessments of the Obama years.
