@NicolleDWallace It's probaby high-level, satellite secret code for intelligence network, "Interstellar, Intergalactic, Gave All the Goods to Russia. Thanks, Jared.", psycho babbling meant to throw off the hounds. Mueller is all over this stuff.
@JohnJHarwood I am hopelessly lost on the use of the word, "appreciative", in this sentence. I cannot see these entitled, elitist twits appreciating much of anything other than padding their portfolios or signing up for tee time, let alone caring about Trump grousing over this #FakeNews again.
I was mortified for that young woman. She was paraded there, in front of America, as a pathetic token of disingenuous flattery to assuage a president's ego. She couldn't speak on her behalf. She wasn't offered a microphone. She had no voice. @RepRashida's cry was deep and hurt.
@NicolleDWallace @DeadlineWH @TheRevAl Did anyone consider that the irresponsibly racist prop act that @RepMarkMeadows shamelessly played out earlier this week, looked like a slave being held out for auction? That is the horrific first thought I had, from the movie, "Roots".
