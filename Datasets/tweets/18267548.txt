#Brexit: It's still an evolving process but what yesterday's vote did was squarely focus on the next debate on February 14, whether an extension to article 50 or what that might even look like, says Bart Oosterveld.
#Brexit: The draft agreement reflects the trade interests of both sides but EU appears to have the upper hand because‚Äî 	a) EU remains remarkably disciplined in maintaining a unified stance	b) Theresa May has no concrete set of instructions
#Brexit: @Consultifi asks‚Äîwhy does it appear that the advantage lies with the European Union? Isn't any negotiation a dance of two sides? There are two reasons for this, says Bart Oosterveld.
#Brexit: @PeterWestmacott and @ACGlobalEcon's Bart Oosterveld both agree that a no-deal Brexit will be very disruptive. Although markets have been thinking about extreme downturns, they know better than to respond to every development in the Commons.
#Brexit: From the European perspective, not much has changed. Theresa May has returned many times before this. With the #Brexit timeline, we might be heading for a delay and extension, says @ACGlobalEcon Bart Oosterveld.
#Brexit: For the EU, there is a significant desire to keep the unity of messaging together. The EU fears opening a pandora's box that might be then impossible to close, says Bart Oosterveld.
#Brexit: It is wrong to suggest that it's a huge victory for May but what it does it do is reunite the conservative party. The chances of getting Brussels to the negotiating table to pass the changes do not look great, @PeterWestmacott says.
#Brexit: It is a remarkable political achievement for Theresa May to receive a mandate from the UK parliament, @PeterWestmacott says on a press call. But there are a couple of problems.

On the subject of US steel and aluminum tariffs, Seade says ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs something that we need to resolve quickly, almost immediately. It‚Äôs in the interest of both countries to get this out of the way.‚Äù		#ACForum 5/ https://t.co/udG1bxmLfR
Asked by @sabrod123 about President Trump threatening to cancel NAFTA to force Congressional approval of USMCA, Seade says the President is ‚Äúputting pressure on Congress to do the right thing‚Äù but that ‚Äúgetting out of NAFTA is a complicated proposition.‚Äù		#ACForum 4/ https://t.co/onXp5XkbUP
‚ÄúThe world is behaving in economic terms more in terms of blocs,‚Äù says Seade. ‚ÄúThe European Union is more united as an economic unit, as an industrial behemoth‚Ä¶ China is integrating a lot with neighboring countries‚Ä¶ North America becomes more of a region‚Äù #ACForum 3/ https://t.co/pEbK2njPHe

‚ÄúWe spent $716 bn on a defense budget‚Ä¶ I fear we are buying way too much of the best 20th century military ‚Äòstuff‚Äô in terms of tanks, planes, ships &amp; guns when most of the conflict in the 21st century will be in cyber, information &amp; space,‚Äù says @MarkWarner #ACForum 6/ https://t.co/mVN7YTtu99
‚ÄúMany people have said what will only stir us to action is a ‚Äòcyber 9/11‚Äô or a ‚Äòcyber Pear Harbor‚Äô,‚Äù says Sen @MarkWarner. ‚ÄúI think that is completely wrongheaded. We are experiencing a level of cyber attacks on a near daily basis‚Ä¶‚Äù #ACForum 5/ https://t.co/nkN8GwlAYv
‚ÄúWhat are those cyber activities that will demand a response‚Ä¶such that if an adversary attacks us they know we will respond?‚Äù asks @MarkWarner. ‚ÄúWe have been afraid of cyber escalation with near-peer adversaries due to our increasing technological interdependence.‚Äù #ACForum 4/ https://t.co/slt5lX6fit

‚ÄúPart of our challenge with cyber‚Ä¶ is that this administration‚Äîat the White House level‚Äîhas still not accepted the threat and the responsibility,‚Äù says Senator @MarkWarner. ‚ÄúIf we don‚Äôt have leadership at the top this challenge we face is much greater.‚Äù #ACForum 2/ https://t.co/QPfApZbwTs

It contradicts Western principles and it is exactly this kind of meddling that sets the stage for Russian hybrid warfare targeting Western citizens. Western leaders should demonstrate the kind of leadership they showed yesterday against electing a Russian as head of Interpol.
The decision emboldened the Kremlin to go to war against Georgia months later. Today, Moscow argues that the West should cede to its dictates to control the national security policies of its near neighbors. The West should reject the claim.
At the NATO Bucharest Summit in the spring of 2008, US efforts to establish a	Membership Action Plan for Georgia and Ukraine failed in the face of Germany, France, and others‚Äô reluctance to ‚Äúprovoke‚Äù Putin. That was a mistake. 		Learn more here: https://t.co/2nLYien6QR
Instead of a unified Europe, the Kremlin presented itself as a center of power with Europe to its west and China to its east. Moscow‚Äôs new belligerence gave Western leaders pause. This, however, was evident even before Moscow‚Äôs August 2008 attack on Georgia.
He moved the country toward an authoritarian direction‚Äîor, as he likes to say, toward a "managed democracy." This Russian pushback included wars in Georgia and Ukraine that changed the map of Europe.		Learn more here: https://t.co/11q317t7ya
Putin took office in 2000 and in his first year, he took control of the major TV stations. He began consolidating power, pushing back against the very concept of a liberal international order, and fighting the rights of former Soviet nations to make their own decisions.
How did we get here? After the end of the Cold War, American vision of liberal principles applied to all former nations of the Soviet empire, including Russia, which under Boris Yeltsin, was classified a "developing democracy." There was no real opposition until Putin stepped in.
The relationship between Eastern Europe and the West could be dramatically altered if the West doesn't push back against Russian aggression. Western policy toward Russia after the end of Cold War was never a formal one but now it should be.		Read: https://t.co/BUsmu9nrBS https://t.co/BZm3vJ1SHm
