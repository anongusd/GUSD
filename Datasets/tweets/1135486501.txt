To all those who have been hurt by gun violence, lost a loved one, or fought tirelessly with us: Today‚Äôs historic vote is for you. We won't stop fighting for commonsense gun safety reforms. #EndGunViolence
After too many instances of gun violence across the country, Americans raised their voices and demanded solutions. An overwhelming majority support commonsense universal background checks. That's why we need #HR8--an overdue step toward solving the gun violence epidemic.
Background checks work: Our current system has already stopped more than 3 million sales to convicted felons and other prohibited purchasers. Expanding the system to cover sales online and at gun shows--where a background check isn't required--will keep more Americans safe.
Today is a new day‚Äîthe House just took real action to keep Americans safe by passing a bipartisan bill to expand background checks to all gun sales. #HR8 #EndGunViolence	https://t.co/8BhXo4hLlp
Real tax reform would promote American growth and competitiveness. Instead, the #GOPTaxScam chose a path that blows up the deficit and hurts working families in the long run. Despite what the Trump Administration claims, these tax cuts still don't pay for themselves. https://t.co/5fNtWp9ZoY

Women should have access to comprehensive reproductive care and limiting information on their options effectively undermines that right.

Bottom line - no matter how well kids are treated at these facilities, it‚Äôs cruel and un-American to separate these kids from their families. We need immediate compliance with the federal court order to reunite.
@RepThompson @RepDeSaulnier @HHSGov Thanks to everyone there for hosting us and their compassion toward our most vulnerable immigrants.
@RepThompson @RepDeSaulnier @HHSGov The staff at this facility was welcoming and dedicated to providing the best possible support and care for these children. We witnessed it in two classrooms where children learned English and Math, and in the faces of these committed and kind professionals.
@RepThompson @RepDeSaulnier @HHSGov It's clear @HHSGov wanted us to see this facility and not one that primarily houses children separated from their families. Still, all these children have difficult journeys-- fleeing violence, persecution, and more. We can't add to that trauma with zero-tolerance policies.
@RepThompson @RepDeSaulnier I was refused access to any of the shelters in San Diego because @HHSGov claimed they never received my request. (We have a confirmation email from their staff.)		We also spent weeks corresponding with HHS to ensure we followed the correct protocols and clearance requirements.
Today I visited an immigrant children's shelter in Pleasant Hill, CA with @RepThompson and @RepDeSaulnier to witness the traumatic effects of separating kids from their parents. #KeepFamiliesTogether

Those Republicans who wanted to help #DREAMers got played by their leadership. They gave up their leverage on the same promise that they would finally get a vote that @SpeakerRyan has been breaking for a year.
While this was happening, our two-party solution to help #DREAMers fell apart this week because we were two Republicans short of forcing a vote on the #DreamAct and the bipartisan compromise #USAAct.	https://t.co/nvc84RQbeh
So the Executive Order will be struck down and Trump will blame the courts, even though the law is clear. Meanwhile, Republican leaders in Congress have pulled the plug on bipartisan legislation that would pass with veto-proof margins and solve the problem.
The Executive Order will permit indefinite detention of families with their children in internment camps, even though that‚Äôs illegal under existing law. The Flores case prohibits indefinite detention of minors, accompanied or not.	https://t.co/a5RKmTLdF8
There is apparently no plan, nor ability, to reunite parents and kids that are now separated. Some parents have been deported without their children and it may be impossible to identify other children who are being held. The damage already done is deep and long lasting.
The Trump Executive Order to stop separating kids from their parents is classic lipstick on a pig. Their border policy is still an immoral and un-American pig.
I sent a letter with my colleagues asking @DHSgov and @HHSGov how they plan to reunite the more than 2,000 children that have been separated from their parents. This is one of many deep concerns we have with the White House's zero-tolerance policy and Executive Order. https://t.co/Qw6Hss7V5T

The Montgomery GI Bill ensured Vietnam veterans could pursue an education. The Post-9/11 GI Bill expanded benefits for veterans on active duty on, or after, September 11 and allowed them to transfer unused educational benefits to their spouse or kids.
In 1944, the G.I. Bill was created to help World War II veterans. The bill opened the door to higher education for many Americans who never had the opportunity. Since 1944, the bill has evolved to help even more veterans.

More than 260,000 people in San Diego County rely on CalFresh, federally known as the SNAP nutrition assistance program. The #FarmBill makes deep cuts to this program that helps families access healthy food when times are tough. https://t.co/5NhOcvjg2l

The budget amendment proposed by Republicans is nothing more than a gimmick to compensate for irresponsible spending-- It actually will prevent Congress from funding certain programs, especially in an emergency.	https://t.co/Y4CxRXHB4F

In particular, I hope he sees how our relationship with Mexico is vital to our region's economy and that we don't have to choose between a safe border and one that enables international trade and tourism.

Watch my full speech on how the commonsense fixes in the ADA Education and Reform Act will help improve access. It addresses a lot of the concerns raised by disability advocates: https://t.co/4DSoP12unH
‚ùå This bill does not weaken the rights of the disabled.	‚úîÔ∏è The bill facilitates the removal of barriers to ensure better access in a shorter period of time and discourages quick payoff lawsuits that do nothing for access.
‚ùå This bill does not shift the burden of compliance from business to victims.	‚úîÔ∏è The bill still requires businesses to comply with ADA. The only difference for victims is whether they provide notice or file a lawsuit.
‚ùå This bill does not relieve business of their obligation to comply with the ADA. 	‚úîÔ∏è Public accommodations are still responsible for ensuring access, must respond to violation notices, and can be sued if they do not improve access.
‚ùå This bill will not turn anyone into a second class citizen. 	‚úîÔ∏èThis bill extends "notice and cure" requirements that already apply to other civil rights laws.
Today we provided the same corrections at the federal level. Let me be clear: this bill does not shield businesses or public accommodations from complying with the ADA. Here's the breakdown:
The bipartisan CA bill:	‚úî gives business 120 days to fix violations	‚úî educates business owners on compliance 	‚úî redirects payouts toward improving access	‚úî protects against serial lawsuits
SB 269 was authored by a Democratic State Senator, passed by a Democratic majority legislature, and signed into law by Governor Brown in 2016.
We hear these stories all the time-- lawsuits being settled without violations being fixed--so much, that state governments have acted to curb this abuse. CA Democrats have led this fight.
The only winner was the lawyer who was filing the same cookie cutter lawsuit all around town.
A small restaurant in downtown San Diego tells this story: It was sued by a lawyer who had filed 50 ADA suits against San Diego Country restaurants in one year. Though no violations existed, proving it in court would have cost $50,000 or more, So they paid $2,500 to settle.
A few bad actors are abusing the ADA, exploiting this landmark civil rights law for personal financial gain. No one disputes this abuse is happening or says this increases access.
Today, the House passed the ADA Education and Reform Act-- a bipartisan bill I helped introduce to ensure businesses can spend money on access not lawyers.

Rs will say a vote against this CR is a vote to shutdown the government, but CRs are not how we're supposed to fund the government. We need real budgeting and appropriation bills.
Unfortunately, this bill once again fails to tackle the difficult issues that have been used as justification for the previous stopgap bills.
The American people have also had enough of short-term extensions and are tired of Congress not coming together to fix our nation‚Äôs problems.
So many of my colleagues join me in opposing a CR-- not just because of policy differences-- but because they are tired of passing stopgap measures.

This uncertain funding process is reckless and hurts our economy and families. Time‚Äôs up for Congress to do its job.
9 million children across America have gone more than 100 days without knowing when or if they would lose their health care. They and their parents deserve to know their health care will be there when they need it.
Federal agencies are forced to delay hiring and halt new projects that could create jobs. Departments are forced to plan for multiple budget scenarios, which is a waste of time and money.
Short term funding leads to costly delays in vital national security programs. This means the Pentagon can‚Äôt meet their training and readiness needs. And the companies contracted to supply the Pentagon freeze production and delay hiring workers.
This process is always encumbered by politics, adding more contention to a process that‚Äôs already difficult. It also divides Congress when we should be working together to find solutions.
Year after year, when Congress fails to pass a budget and get spending bills done on time, we fall back on a continuing resolution, instead of providing real certainty to federal agencies, which hurts our economy and families.	https://t.co/vO7gpygpAP

@EPA @ENERGY It's great the effects are sinking in, but if they don't fully acknowledge the science behind climate change, we need to act.
@EPA @ENERGY That's a start and offers hope that the U.S. can agree on steps toward climate adaptation or a common set of facts that can help us prepare.

The House passed a healthcare bill with no hearings and no bipartisan amendments. The Senate just released one they wrote in a back room.

When we lose as many as twenty veterans a day to suicide, reducing the stigma around mental health injuries can save lives.
They're much more reluctant to tell you about the mental scars and the less visible injuries they wear on the inside.
Ask a servicemember about their injuries, and they are likely to show you the visible scars they wear from their service.
This bipartisan effort will help reduce the stigma that often prevents servicemembers &amp; veterans from getting mental health treatment.

Throughout my time in Congress, improving care for veterans and accountability at the VA has been a bipartisan goal-- and it still is today.
