@markhamron @GovMikeHuckabee Based on the Post's Interactive Map though (https://t.co/pBpj4oe3R0), it'd be a lot more difficult &amp; expensive to build a wall along most of #Texas's border with #Mexico, especially cause a lot of the land on the Rio Grande's banks is privately owned (https://t.co/MkOsOj4Xyz)
@Kat_in_Arizona @brandongroeny @CBP @Sen_JoeManchin But as the Post's article points out, the tunnels that were discovered were built in private residences or abandoned buildings, making them a lot harder to spot. I don't think anyone is advocating leaving the border completely open, they're just against completely sealing it.
@Kat_in_Arizona @brandongroeny @CBP @Sen_JoeManchin How were the problems in Colombia reduced?
@Kat_in_Arizona @brandongroeny @CBP @Sen_JoeManchin But why wouldn't a wall make cartels more powerful if it means that they'll be the only ones with a viable route into the #US?

@Kat_in_Arizona @brandongroeny @CBP @Sen_JoeManchin And I don't think the facilities should just be expanded for #Salvadorans, #Hondurans, &amp; #Guatemalans; they can also help #Venezuelans, #Nicaraguans, &amp; maybe #Cubans. It's a model the EU could also use to stop migrants from making the dangerous journey across the Mediterranean.
@Kat_in_Arizona @brandongroeny @CBP @Sen_JoeManchin That's why the solution Sen. Manchin proposed: expanding facilities at #American missions in Central America &amp; #Mexico to make seeking asylum easier, makes more sense. It addresses the problem at its source by allowing migrants to bypass the coyotes and cartels who'd exploit them
@Kat_in_Arizona @brandongroeny @CBP @Sen_JoeManchin I think they were just reporting that the construction of a wall might just push drug cartels to build more tunnels. I think what's more important to note though, is that the cartels use the tunnels to smuggle migrants as well, the wall would've indirectly made them more powerful
@Kat_in_Arizona @brandongroeny @CBP @Sen_JoeManchin Hahaha, tbh I‚Äôd have probably tweeted about how the #US was largely responsible for making #ElSalvador &amp; #Honduras so dangerous by deporting too many gang members in the early ‚Äò90s and Obama era for their criminal justice systems to handle.

@ravencottage1 @RedPillBlackMan Why do you believe that so adamantly though?
@ravencottage1 @RedPillBlackMan And would you also say #America and its allies should lift their sanctions over the occupation of #Crimea because "the land is #Russia," so we should "get over it"? https://t.co/NeKtgr9kZR
@ravencottage1 @RedPillBlackMan Actually, the latest joint opinion poll published in Aug 2017 shows that 52% of #Palestinians, like 53% of #Israelis, wanted a 2-state solution. Because if there's one thing 100% of Palestinians want, it isn't another Holocaust, it's a country of their own https://t.co/r99OwUsVgG

@SenDanSullivan, if I may misquote Malcolm X: The #Saudi Prince differs from the #Iranian Ayatollah only in one way: the Prince is more deceitful, more hypocritical, than the Ayatollah. #MAGA #Resist #MAGA2020 #MAGAwagon #MuellerTime #KAG2020 #Muellerprobe #MuellerKnowsEverything
@ravencottage1 @RedPillBlackMan Also, calling #Palestinians "Conquered" won't cut it cause conquest is illegal in present-day international law. That's why the #US imposed sanctions on #Russia for its conquest of #Crimea, so I don't see why #Israel shouldn't be treated the same way for colonizing the #WestBank.
@ravencottage1 @RedPillBlackMan I agree it was never a nation-state, but to me, dismissing the fact that the region had consistently been called #Palestine for nearly 2000 years would be like claiming there's no such land as #Virginia &amp; no such people as #Virginians just cause Virginia was never a nation-state.

@ZarryluvChelsie @DovahFem @KyleKulinski @seanhannity repeatedly lied that @EricHolder called for violence, a lie that could've cost Holder his life when Cesar Sayoc tried to assassinate him.

@CZCBZ @SenatorMenendez Definitely @MbSofKSA, the CIA confirmed that he murdered a permanent resident of #America and this fucking psychopath is still able to fly to Buenos Aires and go through life in general with a song and a dance.

@PaulUK2901 @SenatorMenendez @oufenix Impeaching Trump over this seems pretty counterproductive cause it'll only hurt #America's credibility even more. Trump should have the balls to cut off and internationally isolate MBS for murdering #JamalKhashoggi &amp; 1000s of innocent #Yemenis.

@MacyBooMacy @mca_27 @SenatorMenendez The CIA confirmed @MbSofKSA ordered #JamalKhashoggi's murder; yet, he's not just free to attend the G20 summit, he's confident enough to hi-five @PutinRF_Enq, revealing how cowardly Pres. @realDonaldTrump is, Pres. @EmmanuelMacron &amp; PM @theresa_may are for refusing to punish him.

Why are @benshapiro &amp; his guests criticizing the Left for criticizing Kanye? Why don't they point out the fact that @realdonaldtrump wasted time by meeting West instead of dealing with #hurricanemichael2018's devastation of #Florida's Panhandle &amp; #JamalKhashoggi's disappearance?
@benshapiro's guest is right; instead of contributing to #America's division with unproven sexual assault allegations against Judge Kavanaugh, @SenateDems could've stopped him by focusing on how his judicial philosophy puts worker's rights &amp; #Medicare4All at risk #BlueWaveComing.
@BenShapiro just cause majorities of various communities say "political correctness is a problem," doesn't mean they agree on what political correctness is exactly. Social unacceptability of the n-word is considered political correctness to some, but not to many others. #RedWave

Clinton. A guy who does that, then whines about his character assassination, lacks the temperament of a hall monitor, let alone a SCOTUS justice.
@Bud_Doggin @harjo111 Don't take Schumer's word for it; @benshapiro pointed out the FBI can't compel testimony in a non-criminal investigation (https://t.co/boFUgkp8pD). That's why @KyleKulinski argued only an indefinite and unlimited criminal investigation can prove Kavanaugh's innocence or guilt.
@tdpga @harjo111 @SenFeinstein should've made Dr. Ford's allegations public as soon as she first reviewed them. But if @POTUS wanted to prove Kavanaugh's innocence, he could've ordered a criminal investigation and given the FBI as much time as it needed to pursue every lead it deemed relevant.

@charliekirk11 @SenBooker @CoryBooker was wrong to claim mere allegations disqualify Kavanaugh, but why does that mean the senate should #ConfirmKavanaughNow? Why shouldn't claims of sexual assault and perjury be investigated and concretely proved right or wrong before the confirmation process continues?
@Taraleigh43 @charliekirk11 In any case, how would a complete investigation of the 3 allegations, in which every single person who could either corroborate or refute them were interviewed, put anyone's due process in danger? If Kavanaugh were innocent, wouldn't it vindicate him without a shadow of a doubt?
@Taraleigh43 @charliekirk11 The fact that the 1st 6 investigations didn't indicate a history of sexual assault doesn't definitively prove that the current allegations are false. It just means that the 3 women (who I don't think were even interviewed anyway) hadn't yet come forward with those allegations.
@charliekirk11 If the WH published its directive and gave the FBI all the time it needs to pursue all necessary leads, it could assure senators that all allegations were thoroughly investigated and - if Kavanaugh's name were cleared as a result - make a just confirmation process harder to avoid

@HenMazzig @AbdalrahimFarra It was called Judea in antiquity, but then renamed Palestine in the 2nd Century, and universally known by that name up until 1948; so yeah, one could accurately call the area "Historic Judea", but "Historic Palestine" makes more sense in the context of present-day politics.
@C8H804 @HenMazzig @AbdalrahimFarra If the British did indeed initially put #Jordan in the Mandate of Palestine, that doesn't change the fact that today's #Palestinians have their roots, not in present-day Jordan, but in the area between the Jordan River and Mediterranean Sea that was taken from them by #Israel.
@BustingtheLiars @pfantasia88 @HenMazzig @AbdalrahimFarra No, not really, prior to the war in 1948, the majority of #Jordanians were East Bankers; the reason why #Palestinians are a majority of Jordan's population today is that their forefathers were driven out of their actual homeland in historic Palestine during the #Nakba and #Naksa.

@DouglasFOwens1 @The_Trump_Train @realDonaldTrump If that's true, I don't see why his decision to kneel should be an issue; he was informed that kneeling is considered a respectful practice used by the military to honour the dead, which is why he decided to do it to acknowledge the Americans who were killed without due process.
@The_Trump_Train @realDonaldTrump Pretty much what Collin Kaepernick chose to do; he chose to show he believed in acknowledging the men who were unjustly killed by the police, even though it cost him a bit of his popularity.

@louisajan1 @Richard31225984 @IDFSpokesperson Yes, there were violent rioters and terrorists among the peaceful protesters, but regardless the majority of all the protesters as well as the majority of the protesters who've been shot by @IDFSpokseperson snipers weren't committing acts of violence or trying to breach the fence
@365Jeffrey @MoreSocialism @AM43TO @IDFSpokesperson He urged Jewish settlers to "seek to convert the Arab heart," as "they can settle ... only by the goodwill of the Arabs." So I doubt he "would have explained to Gazans that they already won what they claim they are fighting for and could have peace if only ready to compromise."
@365Jeffrey @MoreSocialism @AM43TO @IDFSpokesperson "But according to the accepted canons of right and wrong, nothing can be said against the Arab resistance in the face of overwhelming odds." - Mahatma Gandhi writing about Palestine's Arab Revolt in 1938 https://t.co/C3CPLmypdB

RT @MoreSocialism: @IDFSpokesperson The Israeli government and the IDF consider all Palestinians to be terrorists. https://t.co/ZPDT7YCl5F
@CPA_Arthur @IDFSpokesperson It's clear that a small minority of individuals at the protests are terrorists who want to kill #Israeli civilians, but it's also clear is that a lot of the #Palestinians who've been killed or hurt are civilians, so @IDFSpokesperson's response is disproportionate; simple as that.
@AM43TO @ShearmanDara @IDFSpokesperson What are you, a 7-year-old? And anyway, I think I already asked you, if it's okay to kill #Palestinians for merely touching their frontier with #Israel, why is it okay for #Israeli settlers to illegally displace #Palestinians and build neighbourhoods in the #WestBank?
@Richard31225984 @IDFSpokesperson The fact that the #Palestinians of #Gaza are oppressed by #Hamas doesn't give the #Israeli government the right to impose a blockade on these same people, regularly bomb their cities, exploit their desperation to make them commit espionage, or attack their peaceful protests.

@WordSaladeater @rico_hands @IDFSpokesperson The settlements in the #WestBank are not up for negotiation; international law forbids the creation of civilian settlements in foreign territory that's militarily occupied. And if the #Israeli government was actually negotiating in good faith, it wouldn't be building new ones.
@AM43TO @GinaBarakat4 @IDFSpokesperson If all @IDFSpokesperson did was defend #Israeli civilians from terrorists, how did they manage to kill a journalist wearing a Press jacket? Not to mention shoot live ammunition at and injure 100s of #Palestinians protesters who couldn't all possibly be terrorists?
@lior_mizrahi4 @GinaBarakat4 @CPA_Arthur @IDFSpokesperson 3. As the below @Jerusalem_Post report points out, the majority of protesters were peaceful and stayed well behind the fence, yet, as the number of injuries show, #Israeli snipers apparently deemed 100s of them dangerous enough to shoot live ammunition at https://t.co/XsZ7IWpcCZ
@lior_mizrahi4 @GinaBarakat4 @CPA_Arthur @IDFSpokesperson 1. Conflating all #Gaza #Palestinians with #Hamas makes as much sense as conflating all #Israelis with Likud	2. #Israelis are protected by an Iron Dome, a warning app, and bomb shelters, #Palestinians have barely anything to defend themselves with when @IDFSpokesperson retaliates
@CanaDaveLisbona @JethroTull11 @lagenie24 @IDFSpokesperson Right, but I'm sure you see how unfair that is for Palestinian refugees, given that they never agreed to Israel's creation but were still forced to leave to make room for a Jewish majority, and are now unable to even visit the sites of their old villages and neighbourhoods.
@JethroTull11 @CanaDaveLisbona @lagenie24 @IDFSpokesperson Do you have any sources to support that claim?
@CanaDaveLisbona @JethroTull11 @lagenie24 @IDFSpokesperson Yeah, there's no doubt about that, but since #Israel already has an Arab minority, why couldn't the Israeli government allow #Palestinians with roots in Israel-proper to immigrate back and be granted the same rights as Arab Israelis?
@JethroTull11 @CanaDaveLisbona @lagenie24 @IDFSpokesperson Because the return of #Palestinian refugees might mean Jews could no longer be a majority in #Israel?
@irmahinojosa_ I should also add that the @haaretzcom article indicates he was never an Israeli citizen, that's why I want to know why you believe the rest is accurate
@CanaDaveLisbona @JethroTull11 @lagenie24 @IDFSpokesperson Sure, that's fair, but just as Arab societies shouldn't wait for a resolution to the Israel-Palestine conflict before making amends for antisemitism, why should #Israel wait for Arab countries to stop being anti-semitic before making amends for injustice against #Palestinians?

@thakur5000 @IDFSpokesperson https://t.co/Rr8wW5PXPn As pointed out in this report, most protesters didn't try to breach the fence, and though some did, it couldn't have been all 446 the Red Crescent reported injured, or even all 9 who were killed by @IDFSpokesperson. So yeah, there are a few ifs and buts
@JethroTull11 @lagenie24 @IDFSpokesperson @CanaDaveLisbona Even if some #Palestinians are descended from immigrants who came in 1939,the fact is that the first Zionist immigrants to the region could only settle there in the late 1800s by buying land from absentee landlords and displacing #Palestinian tenants who were already living there
@JethroTull11 @lagenie24 @IDFSpokesperson @CanaDaveLisbona But I highly doubt that #Palestine wasn't a predominantly Arab region at the time, as it would've been since at least the 900s.
@JethroTull11 @Seamus_Belfast @IDFSpokesperson @IsraelinIreland The fact that worse atrocities are committed elsewhere doesn't mean there's nothing to report in #Gaza. Yaser Murtaja was doing his job by covering what his fellow #Palestinian citizens are going through, and he paid with his life for it.
@007RightWing @Bdhathi @IDFSpokesperson It wasn't Arabs who expelled Jews from Judea, it was the Romans, and in any case, what good is holding today's #Palestinians responsible for crimes that were committed against Jews centuries ago?
@rico_hands @YuggothPlanet @thnxweh @ScheremJ @IDFSpokesperson I agree; there was no legitimate reason for #Israel's creation in 1948, as the region was already inhabited by #Palestinians. But having said that, two generations of #Israelis have grown up there, so it's not fair to argue against #Israel's right to exist, if for no other reason
@leekevinj @IDFSpokesperson I'm not saying that none of the #Palestinian factions have done any wrong since the start of the conflict, I'm just saying that the crisis has gone as long as it has because the #Israeli government and settlers continue to colonize and oppress Palestinians.
@lagenie24 @CanaDaveLisbona @JethroTull11 @IDFSpokesperson I'm sorry, but how was it the "Zionists' doing" that made it necessary for Jews to flee their old homelands in Europe and the Arab World?
@rico_hands @YuggothPlanet @thnxweh @ScheremJ @IDFSpokesperson Dude, with all due respect, there's no need to deny that Jews have ancient historical roots in the region, just as it's wrong for Zionists to deny that #Palestinians have a legitimate claim to area, based on their more recent historical presence there.
@CanaDaveLisbona @JethroTull11 @lagenie24 @IDFSpokesperson As far as I'm aware, most #Palestinian #refugees aren't responsible for anti-semitic violence in #Egypt or other Arab countries, so it doesn't make sense for the #Israeli government to prohibit them from returning just because Jews were persecuted elsewhere in the Middle East.
@CanaDaveLisbona @JethroTull11 @lagenie24 @IDFSpokesperson Ok, why not?
@CanaDaveLisbona @JethroTull11 @lagenie24 @IDFSpokesperson I don't think the Right of Return necessarily entails the expulsion of Jewish #Israelis; it's just based on the demand that #Palestinians who've been expelled from the area, as well as their descendants, should be able to live there as well.
@DanielHood1978 @IDFSpokesperson Is strategic depth also the reason that the #Israeli government gives when it illegally displaces #Palestinians in the #WestBank and #EastJerusalem, in order to make room for its citizens to move into the settlements it builds and subsidizes there?
@AgentSelbst @MovementsPod @IDFSpokesperson The reality is that the blockade imposed by @IDFSpokesperson is an act of war against the #Palestinians of #Gaza, and while #Israelis are only reminded of their conflict with #Hamas during events like this, the people of #Gaza are reminded that they're in a state of war every day
@JethroTull11 @lagenie24 @IDFSpokesperson @CanaDaveLisbona You also totally whitewashed the fact that while the #Hashemites originated in the Hejaz and were installed in #Jordan, both #Palestine and #Jordan had Arab-majority populations for centuries before the British Empire encouraged Jewish immigration to their colony after 1917.

Really hope that the #DhakaAttack was an isolated incident, not a sign of further bloodshed after 2013 #PrayForDhaka #PrayForBangladesh
