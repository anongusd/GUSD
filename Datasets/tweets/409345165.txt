#AmazonHQ2: NYS populists - rural conservative and urban liberal ones - briefly found alliance. It won’t last. “Moderate middle” is furiously fomenting division, Rs and Ds are suspiciously retreating to their wings, escorted by shallow media narratives. A glimpse of kinship, tho.
@JMCDB Fair. NY got the deal b/c behemoth Amazon could have any deal it wanted and NY offered most. IMHO, the bad deal was worse than no deal. But I get that others think no deal is worse. Sadly, we can’t really know because the dealmakers won’t show their cards and just say “trust us.”
@JMCDB Can’t get my head around $120,000 (at minimum) per (supposed) job, when jobs aren’t guaranteed and the track record of NY’s taxes-for-phantom-jobs program is so poor. Plus Amazon wouldn’t agree not to oppose unions. Plus usual open process got nixed because deal was “too big.”
When people you may not like are on your team against raising regular folks’ taxes to bribe a huge corp to (maybe) bring jobs here — that doesn’t mean you’re on the wrong team. It just means this one was a no-brainer. It’s ok, everyone can go back to fighting tomorrow. #AmazonHQ2

Thank you so much to @WETM18News for hosting; for tonight's moderators and those asking questions. I see our challenges - let's get to work.
Rather than attacking everyone that has made his job difficult, "I think it's time for Tom O'Mara to 'man up' and start debating me."
I'm proud to stand up for our local farmers and I invite Tom O'Mara to do the same. Not to question whether I am a daughter of farmers.
65% of O'Mara's campaign donations come from outside of our region.
I believe the SAFE Act is a flawed piece of legislation - it doesn't solve the problems of #guns ending up in the wrong hands.
We need to stand up to the powerful interests in Albany and big pharmaceutical companies that don't give enough attention to addiction.
On heroin and opioid abuse in #NY58 - issues are more prevalent in rural counties, and we are seeing this epidemic grow here close to home.
I am proud to be endorsed by @nysut - we stand together for public education.
I'm very concerned when I see our school district funding get re-routed to New York City charter schools. @nysutstro @nysut
We need to reduce taxes and red tape on our small businesses and farms. People - not government - are responsible for creating jobs. #NY58
I believe climate change is a significant event we all need to focus on together. Tom believes fossil fuels will remain strong for decades. https://t.co/tM4IxtdCK2
Our elected leaders in NYS have been hanging us out to dry for too long. We need leaders in Albany who will get the job done.
Tom O'Mara thinks we are getting our fair share. I disagree. Money is pulled away from this region at staggering amounts.
"New York City stole our car and gave us back the hubcaps. And Senator Tom O'Mara was the car dealer."
I'm choosing to stop practicing law while Tom O'Mara continues to collect two salaries. https://t.co/SywK0pqFww
