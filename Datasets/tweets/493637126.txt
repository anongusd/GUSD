Juniper has a low purr going on-and-off. I think sheâ€™s happy for the long period of stability and to have made it through all the shaking earlier today. Weâ€™re all just starting to relax. #Alaskaearthquake https://t.co/InjbpeHsno

#RE needs to make economic cents, which it does given the cost of env degradation. How do we sell it to the masses? Make RE competitive.

Is the #end near? http://t.co/qHT8A75j What do you think? Continue the conversation, spread the word!
You hold the power on the demand side of supply and demand. Making some changes in your life can reduce demand significantly. You can do it!
Consider the true cost of oil, coal, and natural gas. Does degradation of environment and eco services justify them as affordable sources?
Ask the questions: where does your water, food, & energy come from? Where does the waste go? Is there a better way? Start the conversation.
The new diet fad: eat good food from your own garden or your nearest neighbors. Walk, bike, drink water from a reusable bottle. Live simply.

Does sustainability have to imply a poor economy? Can America gently adopt policy that cleans up our act without losing all we've built?
Trading sounds good: gas for EV, plastic for glass, take out for eat at home, coal for solar and wind, more for less, less is more, etc.
conserve #water: wash dishes in a basin in your sink.  It's a closed water system and a LOT of people using it.  Use biodegradable soap!
Recycling is great, but reducing and re-using comes first.  Recycling still demands product.  Watch #Bag It http://t.co/zOaqKxQl
