@sevensixfive theories about how the Sun was hoodwinked into starting the riot ignore fact that we didn't report the flier until much later
@sevensixfive it was, which is why we sat it on until police showed up at Mondawmin in riot gear. That's why I tweeted when I did
@sevensixfive Instagram is impossible to reverse image search so we'll never know who really started it I suppose
@sevensixfive and Erica heard kids shouting "the purge!" during the riot
@sevensixfive all I can tell you I guess is that multiple reporters here saw it or were sent it, we heard anecdotes of it spreading widely
@sevensixfive true. I guess I'm just weary of conspiracy theories about its provenance -- latest I've read is that the Russians did it
@sevensixfive yeah I don't really get the obsession over it to be honest with you. People certainly purged that day
@sevensixfive also, it wasn't like I was the only one who saw it. Our reporters were seeing it on social media/getting sent it all weekend
@sevensixfive yes, a friend posted it on Facebook after having seen it on social media
