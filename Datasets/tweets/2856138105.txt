.@Fahrenthold do we know if Trump is still donating his salary to charity every few months? Haven't heard about that recently.
@PerroGrande86 @jaysjeopardy @ezraklein There was little sensationalism in his claims and many of them were just as damaging for him as they were for Trump. While I don't think he was remorseful per se, he was candid about his failings and didn't seem to take the bait to exaggerate Trump's.
@PerroGrande86 @jaysjeopardy @ezraklein My question about credibility referred to when Cohen said Trump would never hit his wife. If he was lying, he could have used that moment to smear Trump but he didn't. In fact, he pushed back more than once on accusations against Trump that he didn't believe.
@PerroGrande86 @jaysjeopardy @ezraklein I'll likely regret this, but...what do you think those checks were for? When do you think Trump Tower negotiations ended? Do you believe Cohen when he defended Trump against implications of spousal abuse? Does he have zero credibility there, too?
@jaysjeopardy @ezraklein Honestly, a part of me is offended by just how artless this all is. It's bad enough that they believe their supporters can't see it, and even worse that they're probably correct.
@ezraklein Also, I think their position that people who evade taxes and falsify loan applications are worthy of public opprobrium and criminal penalties may not serve them all that well in the future.

@RepGosar @POTUS Pelosi warped back in time to shut down the government before she took office, and also wasn't present at the meetings she was present at with POTUS? Are these alternative facts?

Both parties agreed to it then, but now the Republicans are frozen because they can't count on Trump not to throw another tantrum.
@SenTedCruz @SenateGOP @SenSchumer In 2018, Senate Republicans unanimously consented to fund the government with $1.6bn in additional border funding. Now, they're refusing to even vote on the same bill. Why would you approve it last month and refuse to even consider it now?
