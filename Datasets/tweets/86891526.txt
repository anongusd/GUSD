@chuckwoolery Well, our internal Marxists have taken over education, entertainment, media and even the upper echelon of law enforcement.  Getting rid of them is going to take a lot more than electing @realDonaldTrump president.
@cvpayne That being said, we need some mechanism to level the playing field against foreign companies who do not play by the rules.  Tariffs are a temp measure to give advantage to locals.  Other countries use tariffs against us, this may encourage them to drop their own tariffs.
@cvpayne IF they are temporary, I agree with them.  Long term tariffs are destructive to the host economy.   I think POTUS is trying to punish those who have been abusing us for years. I taught English to Samsung execs in SK.  They admitted they used Clark to get around antidumping laws.
@cvpayne Tariffs have no place in the free market.  I think these are temporary and are attempting to undo idiotic and corrupt practices of the last 20 yrs.

@simplydoright @cvpayne @jack @Twitter When they do this they‚Äôre not protecting snowflakes.  Snowflakes have already blocked those they disagree with.  They‚Äôre preventing us from talking to each other.
@TheMarkPantano On it.  I've been going through comments and doing exactly that.  Following/blocking.
@CharlieTuna19 @lafleurjmmyp @Education4Libs @TyEducatingLibs Me too.
@cvpayne @jack Users already have the option to mute and block.  Why does @Twitter do this?  Let the market decide.  If someone is habitually offensive they will be blocked by all who find them offensive.  #TwitterLockOut
Users can block and mute accounts.  They can even mute keywords. Users who are offended by conservative ideas can easily take their own steps to avoid seeing them in their timelines.  So why did @Twitter do this?  		#TwitterLockOut
@HelenTuttle They've probably been marking them for weeks/months.  It appears the 'switch' was flipped last night in an instant.

@GodandtheBear We are lucky to live in this age.  It can be done relatively cheap.  But that is organizing like minded.  I was talking about changing minds then organizing.  To change a mind is extremely expensive in 2017.  You are battling so many other interests.
@GodandtheBear It takes a lot of $ to get a large group together for any cause.
@GodandtheBear Politics affects everyone but not everyone pays attention to politics.   They take it for granted and simply trust and assume everyone in power is worth trusting so there is no need to spend energy watching their every move.
@GodandtheBear Me too!  That would be paradise but we are very far removed from that now.
@GodandtheBear I have a brother who spends 100% of his non-essential brain power thinking about sports.  I‚Äôm sure he‚Äôs not the only one.
@GodandtheBear Well for one I‚Äôm talking about this.  Can you honestly say that 100% of the population spends any amount of time discussing politics?
@GodandtheBear I hear you.  I don‚Äôt want anyone controlling me either,   if you don‚Äôt you have to be involved in whatever political system you find yourself otherwise you‚Äôre willing to be ruled by your lessers.
@GodandtheBear I don‚Äôt.  But for the crowd to rule the crowd must be informed to a point that is unrealistic at this time.
@GodandtheBear Good point.  I think the brain was the same but since there was no writing and storing of information for extended periods most time was spent hunting and gathering.  Laws and social contracts are less than 20k yrs old.
@GodandtheBear Democracy is the messiest most unstable form of govt ever conceived.  Republic is much better.  But for a Republic to be effective you need an educated electorate and checks and balances.

@900ddot009 If you believe that there is no corruption in Mississippi and that everyone charged with a crime is guilty I feel for you.
@900ddot009 Yes, have you ever been to Mississippi?  I didn't commit a felony but I plead to one to get out of jail.
@costellodaniel1 @ptuns They jumped the shark when they put a terrorist on the cover.

Mississippi has a system ensuring it's stronghold on last place in everything.  It's called the Good Ole Boys Network.
My argument is that all universities are not equal and that #SouthernMiss, in their own words, "goes to the top". #SMTTT #USM21 #USM https://t.co/OvyeG9jtyf
