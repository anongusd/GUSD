Let‚Äôs be clear: any crisis that came out of the caravan was manufactured by Trump. As the United States, we should have welcomed those seeking refuge and allowed them due process. Instead, he showed his true colors by closing the door on families and tear gassing children.
Then he sent the military‚Äîan extreme, costly &amp; immoral decision that further militarized border communities. 		And when some arrived, he closed down the ports of entry and tear gassed families seeking safety. 		He tear gassed children.
OK, since he brought it up, let‚Äôs talk about the last caravan. Instead of preparing to welcome asylum seekers with due process, Trump spent months spreading hate and fear for political reasons in the lead up to the midterm elections.

Our demand is simple: human dignity for all. 		Trump‚Äôs ‚Äúpublic charge‚Äù rule changes will harm children, their parents, and their families. The government must read all comments about the change ‚Äì add yours: https://t.co/JpVHu03vMK #ProtectFamilies https://t.co/L8l6mzjH3f
Trump‚Äôs proposed regulation would reject our shared history and ensure that only the wealthiest immigrants can have a future here. It would make the United States a sicker, poorer, and hungrier nation. Read more from our friends at @PPFA #ProtectFamilies	https://t.co/fIFpcnpR7d

This isn‚Äôt a monarchy, it‚Äôs a Republic, and the President would do well to remember that ‚Äî or be reminded of that.
Just last year, this same administration was calling on Congress to ‚Äútighten‚Äù rules regarding asylum. It failed, and now Trump is trying to run an end game around one of the bedrock principles of our democracy: that Congress ‚Äî not the President ‚Äîmakes law.
In the case of asylum, Congress has delineated, very clearly, that asylum is available to ANYONE who ‚Äúarrives in the United States (whether or not as a designated port of arrival).‚Äù 	A presidential proclamation doesn‚Äôt eviscerate all of that legislation.
The kind of action the President signed is commonly known as a 212f. But the Supreme Court has already made it clear that 212f isn‚Äôt a magic incantation that the President can utilize whenever he wants to ban people.
UPDATE: This morning, the President signed a proclamation effectively slamming the door on asylum seekers. They‚Äôre hiding behind a legal argument that doesn‚Äôt make any sense. Here‚Äôs why: https://t.co/upr99ldnA7
One need only remember that the U.S. once shamefully turned away Jewish refugees fleeing the Holocaust. We must do everything we can to prevent the Trump administration from repeating this ugly chapter of our history. 5/5
Once again, Trump seeks to divide us by preying upon people in most need of help. With this proposed change, the Trump admin is effectively sending a message that the U.S. is shutting the door on asylum seekers, which is morally bankrupt. 4/
There are already worrying reports that the Trump administration is violating international and U.S. law by turning away asylum seekers. https://t.co/1CcEswqNHN 3/
Seeking asylum is a right. Full stop. No matter how someone enters the U.S., they are allowed to apply for asylum. The United States is party to numerous international treaties that enforce that right, as it should be. 2/

Imagine having to worry that taking your child to get a flu shot could put your immigration status at risk. That's exactly the kind of dilemma that will emerge if the Trump administration advances this cruel policy. #ProtectFamilies  https://t.co/K4Xa9bCYvP
@UNITEDWEDREAM @MALDEF @NewJerseyOAG Bottom line: today‚Äôs hearing changes nothing for now. We‚Äôll continue to provide updates as they come. Stay up-to-date on #DACA litigation with our explainer:  https://t.co/gbg7HwZTCd
@UNITEDWEDREAM 5Ô∏è‚É£ We should all be grateful to @MALDEF and @NewJerseyOAG for defending DACA and immigrant youth in court today. Meanwhile, attorneys in the room note that the Trump administration put up just a few minutes of argument in a 3 HOUR hearing. #DefendDACA
@UNITEDWEDREAM 4Ô∏è‚É£ Over ~100,000 DACA recipients live, work, and call Texas their home. Texas‚Äô economy and communities are stronger because of our nation‚Äôs immigrant youth and the DACA program. #ProtectDreamers
@UNITEDWEDREAM 3Ô∏è‚É£ There‚Äôs no way to predict how the Texas court will rule, but regardless of the outcome, a ruling from the Texas judge alone does not erase the orders from the NY, CA and DC courts allowing #DACA to continue.
2Ô∏è‚É£ That means that USCIS is still accepting #DACA renewal applications. If you think you‚Äôre eligible, we recommend that you consult a legal service provider now. Visit @UNITEDWEDREAM for more information: https://t.co/nZoT3VtrFV
DACA UPDATE: Here are a few takeaways following today‚Äôs #DACA hearing in Houston. 		1Ô∏è‚É£  The court heard arguments in Texas‚Äô challenge to the #DACA program but it will not issue a ruling today or anytime before Monday. ‚Üì
@MarielenaNILC @CLASPOlivia ‚ÄúOne of our biggest concerns is that people who are eligible for progs such as health/nutrition will be frightened from participating in those programs..As a result, we will see ppl who have medical needs forgo services, &amp; families will go hungry‚Äù ‚ÄîShelby Gonzales @CenterOnBudget
@MarielenaNILC ‚ÄúAs we‚Äôve seen in the separation of children from their parents on the border, the administration‚Äôs policies towards immigrants too often target children for the greatest damage.‚Äù ‚Äî@CLASPOlivia #ProtectFamilies
‚ÄúThese are all cruel policies and a cynical effort to use immigration as wedge issue in the midterm elections.‚Äù  ‚Äî@MarielenaNILC #ProtectFamilies

But here‚Äôs where the Trump administration is making a big mistake. Today, we are witnessing everyday Americans who have stood up, spoken out, and fought back against Trump‚Äôs abuses. We must stand together and fight the challenges that lie ahead. 6/ #ProtectFamilies
By working hard and building better lives for their families, immigrants have and continue to make our country stronger. This forthcoming Trump regulation would make us a poorer, sicker, hungrier, and weaker nation. 5/ #ProtectFamilies
Bottom line: we know that Trump is dead set on harming immigrants ‚Äî whether it be taking away children from their parents, ending the #DACA program for ~800,000 #Dreamers, or rigging the system for the rich; emboldening white supremacists; and scapegoating immigrants. 4/
We‚Äôve seen abuses like this before in our history ‚Äî whether it was turning away Jews fleeing the Holocaust or discriminating against Irish Catholics. History cannot repeat itself. We can‚Äôt allow it. 3/ #ProtectFamilies
The Trump administration‚Äôs forthcoming ‚Äúpublic charge‚Äù regulation represents a MAJOR component to Trump‚Äôs extremist immigration agenda‚Äîone that disregards human life and forces millions of families to choose between the basics they need &amp; the people they love. 2/ #ProtectFamilies

We will have the Court‚Äôs decision before it recesses in late June. Until then we must not stop fighting for #NoMuslimBanEver 9/9
Our side argued that the Muslim Ban runs roughshod over Congress‚Äô legislative judgment, contradicts the finely reticulated immigration system Congress has adopted, and violates  the INA and the Establishment Clause of the Constitution. 8/
The government asserts that the ban came out of a multi-agency, worldwide review that applied neutral criteria. That is their central argument 7/
Chief Justice asked if the taint of the President‚Äôs anti-Muslim statements ever dissipates. Neal Katyal, representing Hawaii, pointed out that @POTUS has not disavowed any of his statements but instead has embraced them. 6/ #nomuslimbanever
Justice Sotomayor asked the government to affirm to the court that no other countries that failed the criteria set out in the proclamation were excluded from the list of banned countries. The government could not do this. 5/
Justice Kagan asked if an ‚Äúout of the box‚Äù President made vehement anti-semitic statements, then banned nationals from Israel on the advice of his Cabinet, would such a ban be lawful? 4/
Justice Kennedy pushed back on the Trump administration‚Äôs argument that President Trump‚Äôs 2016 campaign statements are irrelevant. #NoMuslimBanEver 3/
Justice Sotomayor and Breyer are concerned that the so-called waiver of the #MuslimBan is window dressing. If that‚Äôs the case, it would add one more reason #Trump‚Äôs executive order is unprecedented. 2/
THREAD: Insights from inside the courtroom: Hard to say what the justices will decide. By and large both sides presented the same arguments they‚Äôve been presenting to the lower courts. 1/#NoMuslimBanEver

The @WhiteHouse knows that family-based immigration processes disproportionately impact people of color. It's clear that this is yet another corrosive example of the administration‚Äôs unwavering white supremacist agenda. 6/6 #NoFamilyBan
These awful policies negatively affect all corners of society, including state &amp; local governments, businesses, schools, health providers, &amp; others who care deeply about ensuring that families are reunited and afforded the ability to thrive in this nation. 5/ #NoFamilyBan
No parent should feel like they aren‚Äôt able to seek critical care for their child, and any policy that would make it harder for them to do so stands in stark contrast to our nation‚Äôs values. 4/ #NoFamilyBan
If we want our communities to thrive and prosper, all families must be able to receive the critical care and services they need. 3/ #NoFamilyBan
This proposed rule is HEARTLESS. It would essentially force families, including US citizen kids, to choose between getting the help they need ‚Äî like pre-school education, nutrition assistance, and medical care ‚Äî and reuniting with those they love. 2/

You can help people like Ximena by calling 210-852-2542 and asking your Representative and Senator to support granting #Dreamers legal status by immediately passing the #DreamAct. 12/ #TheFosters
Fortunately, there is a solution for people like Ximena and her family. Congress has an opportunity to pass the #DreamAct ‚Äî a bill that would grant #Dreamers legal status &amp; protect them from deportation. 11/
To date, over 15,000 people have lost their #DACA status and, with it, their temporary protection from deportation and their ability to provide from themselves and their families. 10/
122 #DACA recipients lose their protection status every day since President Trump‚Äôs decision to end the program. 9/ #TheFosters
The Trump Administration terminated the #DACA program in September of last year. A fraction of the nearly 800,000 young people with DACA were allowed to apply for renewal during a short, one-month window. 8/
Ximena‚Äôs story happens to thousands of immigrant youth every single day. 7/ #TheFosters
DACA status must be renewed every two years but Ximena didn‚Äôt renew her DACA status because she was afraid of getting her family in trouble with ICE &amp; her #DACA protection ended. 6/
DACA recipients are American in every single way but on paper. They‚Äôre our friends and neighbors, and America is the only home they‚Äôve ever known. 5/ #TheFosters
#DACA was intended to allow young immigrants who were brought to the United States as children to get temporary protection from deportation &amp; the ability to work. 4/ #TheFosters
