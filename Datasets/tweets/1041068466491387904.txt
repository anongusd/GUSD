@realDonaldTrump No need to read the testimony we saw it and heard it with our own ears and eyes they contradict you
@wrenncarol @richard_garnet @SpeakerPelosi @realDonaldTrump @AnnCoulter The idea that US arms ISIS or the Taliban, you need to know the facts.  Both groups were allies to the US in fights against our enemies. Before ISIS, they helped US fight Iraq Insurgence. Before Taliban, they were known as the Mujahideen, they helped US against Russia- FACTS
@wrenncarol @richard_garnet @SpeakerPelosi @realDonaldTrump @AnnCoulter Seriously?  Benghazi was investigated even longer than Trumps Russia. Though tragic, nothing nefarious. Do you know what Fast &amp; Furious was? It was set up to track gun smuggling.  Iran deal was NOT dead of Knight? It was an International, Multi National negotiated, and it worked!
@wrenncarol @richard_garnet @SpeakerPelosi @realDonaldTrump @AnnCoulter What?  Are you serious?  Who?  I’d ask if you have proof but by the statement alone, I see you’re one of those crazy conspiracy theorist.  Let’s me guess, you also think 911 was an inside job? There’s a “Deep State”? Vladimir is friends of Donny’s?
@realDonaldTrump Opportunity to support our Southern neighbor &amp; lend a hand. Help Mexico and you help US. We send support to Columbia, Afghanistan, Somalia but NOT to our friends &amp; neighbors?  What an awesome opportunity to address this problem.  We can share expertise, resources and knowledge
@realDonaldTrump Mr Trump, you shouldn’t expect much help for your wall. You didn’t have help from the Republican held Congress and you sure as hell won’t have it from the Democratically held Congress #getaclue
@realDonaldTrump You can NOT Scare Americans into supporting you!  We’ve seen this from you over and over again.  Sorry #MrBoneSpur, unlike you, Americans are Not Afraid.  We are Proud and Strong and will not cower to your fear bongering.
@realDonaldTrump @GOP @realDonaldTrump It’s time for a Break in the Republican Party.  there are two parties vying for influence; 1-Donald Trump Isolationist/Social Conservative,  2-Moderate/Fiscal Consv/Mainstream. Time to split the O’l GOP. You’re destroying that party!
@realDonaldTrump Intel Report, Never Mentions the Southern Boarder- They do address Your Friends:	N Korea Still &amp; Current Nuclear Threat	ISIS Still &amp; Current Terrorist Threat	Russia Still &amp; Current Geo Political Enemy of US China Still &amp; Current Cyber &amp; Intel Threat	TRUMP FAILES TO PROTECT THE US
@realDonaldTrump You are “Clueless”. Facts, US Intelligence, real experts that know and understand the situation on the ground know Iran is Not a threat to US.  We are NOT threatened or afraid of Iran, sorry #mrbonespur. You will NOT “ Scare Americans Again” Stop trying to “Make America Afraid”!
@LindseyGrahamSC Stop the Show Boating!
@LindseyGrahamSC Roger Stone, “ the FBI Agents were extremely courteous”. Now I ask you Senator, are you also ready to throw American Intelligence under the bus so that Trump likes you?
@LindseyGrahamSC Are you f_c_ing kidding us?  Roger Stone would have destroyed any and all information he had if he was “asked” to come in.  He said on TV he was working with Wikileaks(hostile to US). America first!  Always!

@realDonaldTrump What Progress?  Our intelligence, the BEST in the World, tells us the truth and a very different story. NK is still stock piling nuclear weapons.
@realDonaldTrump 😝. We are all lol at your negotiating skills.  The group of Rep and Dems are actually working on a plan that increases Boarder Security not not just placating your damn wall. Security matters.  Your ego Does Not!
@realDonaldTrump @foxandfriends Lies all lies. The intelligence you receive everyday shows you that this is Not True. I guess that’s why you rely on Fox &amp; Friends. #Sad
@realDonaldTrump Iran had been and is still compliant with the Iran deal brokered by the world.  Go back to school and get past your undergraduate like All of These Top Ranked Intelligent Officers #Loser.
@realDonaldTrump Dude, the US once had a Great relationship with Iran. They have elections and could be a great Regional partner.  Go back to school you’d see that. Dump the Kingdom/Monarcy/911 Bombers/Dictators in Saudia. I k ow they $Pay you but our Nation gets nothing.

@kholamon @michaelmalice @realDonaldTrump People are saying.
@Lrihendry @realDonaldTrump Fact check: Congress Shut Down the Government in 2013 NOT Obama.  Opp’s sorry, I forgot you all are NOT into Fact Based arguments. Trumps “KAFU” Keeping America Fckd Up” is over in 2020.  Even 48% of Republicans want someone else besides him. Either New Rep or Dem. #TrumpSucks
@dothanwebpro @tallkathy1 @ZacksJerryRig @realDonaldTrump What changed was this guy asking for $billions to spend without a plan. ALL previous funding approval went specifically towards Boarder Security measures, planned &amp; approved by experts.  This idiot simply wants to build his “Trump Wall” no plan, no idea where or why, just build.
@realDonaldTrump Only fools, or people with a political agenda, want a Wall or Steel Barrier to protect our Country from Crime, Drugs and Human Trafficking. It will not happen - it never does!

@dylanmsmitty @veronicaromm @KamalaHarris @realDonaldTrump other stronger candidates in mind for 2020.  From SF with knowledge of her record and we need strength and conviction.  Too many historic issues with integrity and people of color, not her strong suite.  Was on wrong side of law too many times that didn’t support people of color.
@wrenncarol @richard_garnet @SpeakerPelosi @realDonaldTrump @AnnCoulter Oh you mean Trump?	Pro Choice before he was not?	Pro Marriage before he got divorced? Again? Again.	Pro Hillary before he was not?	He loved women, until he started grabbing them by the P_ __y.	He respected Megan Kelly until he didn’t. 	Supported war in Afghanistan until he didn’t
@veronicaromm @KamalaHarris @BetoORourke Kamala didn’t have support of her own city SF. The African American population didn’t like her prosecurial stances &amp; she made a lot of poor choices and decissi9ns that negatively impacted people of color, her crime lab in SF was a complete mess.  That being said, sure over Trump!
@veronicaromm Of course you do!  Lol, it’s part of your DNA.  Strong anti Putin woman who would take America back from Vladdy.
@sharonseamanfit @siano2020 It won’t be either

@PaysTara @KamalaHarris @BryDeborah Then don’t eat at McDonalds. Eating at McDonalds also increases our national health care cost, so there’s another reason not to eat at McDonalds. But then again it cuts down on the cost of SS payments.  Does it all balance out in the end?
@KamalaHarris Ms Harris, is a living wage subject to cost of living /area of residence?  Simply ask because cost of business does differ. Some think that a business man in your State of California can afford $15 but rural Mississippi could face real financial/business challenges.   Just asking

Conspiracy Theory? Really!  Mr President, you are unable to protect our country because you only respond through a self centered, ego centric space.   This Terrorist Bomber is one of yours! #getreal https://t.co/RzFsBH3qWu
@DanaBashCNN UnAmerican @parscale!  @realdonaldtrump. We, Americans are all@about Free Press!
@LouDobbs Lou, you are Right about one thing, NO One in their right mind would support a party that advocates hatred, conspiracy theories and bombings.    Americans will reject hatred this Nov 6th and Lou is right to be scared!
Like the American Nationalist Bomber - Trumps gamble to embrace Saudi Arabia’s Prince and White Nationalist  backfired badly. Who dares criticize the Saudi/Trump regimes?  Free Speech will NOT be silenced!  https://t.co/QtRPVyOdO1
Enough!  We keep hearing the hatred and distain for “Those” people. “Those” politicians and “The” Mainstream Media. Enough!	You can not advocate violence, praise a Politician who body slams a reporter and then turn around and play the victim @realDonaldTrump https://t.co/xelm2cDAJi
@KrisParonto @BarackObama My friend, I think you are completely off base regarding Americans disappointment with Trumps’ cozy relationship with MBS (Mr Bone Saw) Americans don’t like our leaders covering up murder by crazed rulers. #getagrip on the anger dude! @realDonaldTrump

@jcforjc7 @tracyb12371 @kschase13 @parscale @ToyotaCenter And how is Tiny Trump getting to the rally?  Exactly!  Maybe he can use the $100 million his buddy in Sadia Arabia MBS - Mr Bone Saw  sent him this week to offset costs.
@parscale @ToyotaCenter Lol - So now that Lying Ted and Tiny Trump can’t attract the “huge crowds”, they’re back to exaggerating size again!   Sad.
@anewarnke @parscale @realDonaldTrump God has nothing to do with this corrupt human being!
Crooked Trump at it again. Getting Rich this time off a dead reporter!  Sad!	Saudi Arabia Wires U.S. $100 Million as Trump Proclaims M.B.S. Innocent - Vanity Fair https://t.co/PMu4EajMGR
Yes Senator, you are doing that! Suppression of Americans right to vote not to mention, an assault on the first amendment. https://t.co/ke8DXw0V6O
@RepMcSally This is the definition of “lying”  to say that the Taliban was responsible for 3,000 people dying on 9/11, when in FACT 9/11 was planned and carried out by the friends of @realDonaldTrump Saudi Arabia! 	Stop covering up for Saudi Arabia, American killers!
@realDonaldTrump Mob Rule?  This is absolutely ridiculous give T-party antics at town hall meetings and Trumps very own words about “Beating the hell outta someone”.  Come on man!

@IvankaTrump @nikkihaley @UN @StateDept @realDonaldTrump She’s laying out 2020 as Trump’s #nextVP .  When she said, sometimes change is good for an administration.  @realDonaldTrump needs her in 2020. Pence served his initial purpose with the Evangels, now she’ll serve his women’s vote issue. Kissing up to Trump &amp; kids!	Watch!

@parscale The “Electoral College” was NOT designed to protect any particular type of state but WAS designed to put the final electoral decision in the hands of “A Political Elite”.	As seen in 2016 and Ted Cruz’s effort to have that group support him over the People’s Choice.	Be Honest!
@funder @RepKevinBrady @WSJ @realDonaldTrump Right!
@RepKevinBrady @WSJ @realDonaldTrump Are you out of your mind?  Americans should demand this if ALL Presidents/Presidential Candidates.  Democracy depends on full transparency
@kanyewest FK off. America is not about accepting racism@Nd bigotry

@kananaugh. Senators get real!  Kavanaugh is guilty and wrote about it back in his Yearbook. Devis Triangle is NOT a drinking game. https://t.co/rBm40Zsfj4
@KamalaHarris #nokavanaugh. A Judge who buys into conspiracies. The “Clintons”?  Really?  Anti Trump?  His behavior has a price too.
#kavanaughtempertantrum. A conspiracy theorist in the September Court?  A Judge who blames the “Clintons”, hatred for Trump?  Come on man. Sad! #nokavanaugh
#kavanaugh destroyed his own future. His actions have consequences. He’s raising his voice as if that make what he did different.
@DonaldJTrumpJr Not strange at all. People that have fear of flying can fly it’s just not preferred. Flying for pleasure helps alleviate some of that fear. Stop you attack on the victim!
@MZHemingway @DonaldJTrumpJr Regarding flying. Ask anyone of your friends that don’t like to fly  or anyone in the aviation industry. Big difference flying for vacation as opposed to other related flights.
@ArthurSchwartz @DonaldJTrumpJr No sir, you are absurd trying to have our Supreme Court filled with another sexual offender.  Sad
@ArthurSchwartz @DonaldJTrumpJr Bone Spurs @realDonaldTrump   Sad!
@parscale Your Hyperbole is entertaining as well as a window into the vacuous understanding of your reality

@TeamTedCruz @tedcruz I agree with Bato, we are better than these terrible examples of clear racism.  No matter who commits them, we can and will do better. Thanks Ted for showing us how awesome, fair and real Beto is. Vote Beto Nov 6
@NRA @tedcruz Everyone hates Ted. Even his own Senators thinks he as A Hole. He’ll say and do anything for Ted
@SteveScalise Please@remind POTUS of this.
The attorney general protects the American people. And the fact that we have a president who doesn’t understand that is alarming.”                                       Trump feels angry, unprotected amid mounting crises - The Washington Post https://t.co/ctvcZQfFw0
@DonaldJTrumpJr @realDonaldTrump Your insinuating that CNN was lying about the hurricane.   Come on man!  Get real.
@AG_Conservative It’s called “confidentiality”. If keeping in confidence, information from this victim is wrong, then let us all be wrong when it comes to protecting the names of sexual assault victims.
