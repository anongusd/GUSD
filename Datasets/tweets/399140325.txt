@agentbizzle @IGN @MaxScoville Yay!!!
@MrGrahamMunro 💚
@PocketKnifeBill Thank you for the sweet message 💕
I'm still weak, far from perfect, but I'm trying my hardest to stay strong for you, Ian, having the true strength that you showed me, spreading kindness and love. Rest In Peace... and you better have that Player 2 controller ready for me when we meet again. 👧🏻👦🏻💕
Ian, the sweetest, gentlest person I have ever known, tried to teach me this when he was on Earth. His passing is what solidified these lessons in my heart.
They know their weaknesses and seek help when they need it. They're not afraid to apologize and retreat, because they know conflict is unnecessary. They know love prevails, it conquers all. There's no need for anger or hate.
I used to think being strong, was being hard, a force, sticking to your guns. Well, I got plenty of that. But people with true strength are also soft and kind when met with harshness. They hold their tongue and lovingly listen when others are cruel and vicious...
Two years ago, I lost my best friend, my twin, my little brother, Ian. People always say: "It gets better" -- but it doesn't. You just get stronger. RIP 👧🏻👦🏻💕 https://t.co/RuGYm8NPmh

@oscarinmv Love Tim Burton's adaptations!!!
@BrandonHill156 yeah... I mean the Marvel movies are amusing and charming. DKT was just heavier, hit me harder. But, that's me :)
@TheFragaLegacy Oh yeah! MCU isn't awful! They have some solid movies. I just like the DKT more personally! But who know what Marvel has up their sleeve... maybe they'll surprise me!
@justonescarf I mean Ledger obviously is a huge part of why DKT is fantastic, but I loved Bale, Freeman, Caine, Murphy, Hathaway, Hardy -- that's just naming a few -- a lot of great performances! And I always felt heavier emotions watching DKT vs. Marvel.
@brongers457 I find Marvel Movies funny, charming and fun. The Dark Knight Trilogy had me on the edge of my seat and I felt a lot of emotion while watching those movies. They're just different and I, personally, enjoyed DKT more!
@Espiownage I fell asleep both times I tried to watch Winter Soldier. Different strokes for different folks! I just remember feeling anxiety, shock and excitement while watching the DK trilogy. Maybe it's because I love Batman so much and have a deeper connection with that character.

Ian, you would have turned 30 today. We would have sat around you at the dining table, like this. Singing. Laughing. You would have sported that shy smile— awkwardly dealing with all the attention. What I would do to be by your side, hugging you, welcoming you to your 30s... https://t.co/6mDpVfZ5W5

A Tulane University psychiatrist is on the stand now for the #TravisBoysTrial
#TravisBoysTrial Joseph: What my brother did was really f'd up -- I don't tell people that he's my brother. I don't want my name in the paper. I don't want to be here. I was ordered to be here. My damn livelihood is at stake.
#TravisBoysTrial Prosecution asks, so he can't read? But he can drive? Joseph says yes. Prosecution brings up how Boys brutally beat a nephew, but he claims he "clicked out" and that Boys hid under the bed and he refused to come out.
#TravisBoysTrial Prosecution asks what kind of words could he use? Joseph says he cannot use big words. He wouldn't know what an "application" was, he doesn't know how to deal with "money?" Jospeh agreed. Prosecution asks how he made money. Joseph says he was always incarcerated
#TravisBoysTrial Prosecution asks what kind of words could he use? Joseph says he cannot use big words. He wouldn't know what an "application" was -- he doesn't know how to deal with "money?" Jospeh agreed.
#TravisBoysTrial Prosecution and Defense arguing over wording a question. Judge is asking them to quiet down. Prosecution says you say Travis is so mentally deficient -- can he remember phone numbers -- dates and times? Joseph says he cannot do any of that.
#TravisBoysTrial Prosecution is bringing up a mental exam on Travis's mother from 2010. JOSEPH: In 2002 or 2003, she turned over "power of attorney" over of mother to younger sister DeShaun. Travis would never be given access.
#TravisBoysTrial PROSECUTION CROSS EXAMINATION OF Joseph... They called my mom crazy. People who haven't seen me in years tell me they're so proud of you. I get offended, because they see the lifestyle I live now &amp; they think I was going to be mentally challenged or a criminal.
#TravisBoysTrial Joseph: After that night he was taken to a hospital, he was mentally evaluated and they said he was paranoid schizophrenic. His actions are devastating to me. My heart goes out to Officer Holloway's family. I am sorry about that.
#TravisBoysTrial Joseph: One night he was sitting in a chair with a knife in his hand and then he tried to jump out a window. His wife grabbed him before he went through and he was very combative and hit the ground from a two-story building. Broke his leg.
#TravisBoysTrial Joseph: He's always been a troubled child. He's always in denial. He'd always act like there was a third person involved. Someone else inside him who was responsible.
#TravisBoysTrial Joseph: 'Travis acted like my mom' -- he came to me and said someone was after him, someone was following him. She let him in and then he came inside and hid in a closet -- but in the end no one came. I think it was a delusion.
#TravisBoysTrial Joseph: Without his wife wouldn't live in the nice house. Without partner or spouse he'll surf couches. People would take advantage of Travis. Looked for friendship and loyalty in the wrong kind of people.
#TravisBoysTrial Joseph:  Travis's old wife provided a stable home for him, and gave him a lot of love and care despite his set backs. Took care of his personal business for him. Made sure he had an ID.
#TravisBoysTrial Joseph: Travis's second job lasted 6 months. He worked for a cleaning company -- that eventually fell apart while he was working there.
#TravisBoysTrial Joseph: Travis got jobs through his spouses, and messed things up for her and himself. It was for a garbage company in New Orleans East. You have to follow guidelines, but Travis didn't do that. He just worked when he wanted to. Leave responsibility on others.
#TravisBoysTrial Joseph: Travis didn't do school. I don't think he got a 5th or 6th grade education. He could not read very well. I'd be surprised if he knew his SSN.
#TravisBoysTrial Joseph talks about other family members killing themselves. A few of my relatives who suffer from mental illness are now deceased. We all kept secrets. This passes on from generation to generation.
#TravisBoysTrial Joseph: Travis was sexually abused. An uncle sexually molested my brother. He [performed oral sex on Travis Boys]. When we found about it we were told to never talk about it again.
#TravisBoysTrial Joseph: Travis continued to wet the bed even when he was school-aged. Depression, Bipolar, Paranoid Schizophrenia history in our family. As well as, perverts and sexual abusers in our family. It's a "generational curse" or something
#TravisBoysTrial Joseph: I never had a childhood. I took care of Travis and my other younger sister. If they peed in the bed -- I got whooped for it. I had to dress them, feed them, get them to school. I had to look after them the best I could, the age I was.
#TravisBoysTrial Joseph: We received checks for her mental disability. Other people in the family would only want to help out her kids if they were going to get some money.
#TravisBoysTrial Joseph: During the breakdowns, their mother would do things that were 'really scary, you'd think she was a crack head' -- but she had a mental condition. People called her crazy. She would wander around the neighborhood, talk to herself, cried a lot.
#TravisBoysTrial Joseph (cont): When [their mother] would have nervous breakdowns, the siblings would be separated. Treated poorly and were abused -- emotionally and physically.
Joseph says their mother had mental health issues. She says her mother was a paranoid schizophrenic. The family was frequently separated from her because she was admitted to many mental hospitals during their childhood. #TravisBoysTrial
The defense is calling their first witness, Jermice Joseph of New Orleans. She's the older sister of Travis Boys. They have different fathers. She has never met or seen Travis's father. She says he never had a father.
Travis Boys again appearing in court, dressed in a navy blue suit, handcuffed. His trial should begin shortly. We will have a live report with the latest at 11AM @WGNOtv
