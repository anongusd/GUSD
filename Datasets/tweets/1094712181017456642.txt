@lltwing @JinjoRene If you agree it is evil tell that to the Palestinains who actually do that.
@CodyDeffendall @Hebahersi @IlhanMN @Amy_Siskind @mehdirhasan that is true, but it is still recognized as Jewish state

@lltwing @JinjoRene they do little evil almost only good
@CodyDeffendall @Hebahersi @IlhanMN @Amy_Siskind @mehdirhasan true if you can prove any acceptable behavior, but by default Israel is conflated with the Jewish ppl as it is the Jewish state
@faulknrgreaves @Hebahersi @IlhanMN @Amy_Siskind @mehdirhasan The haters have ways of misconstruing facts, Israel benevolence is also well documented.
@lltwing @Hebahersi @IlhanMN @Amy_Siskind @mehdirhasan If firefighters fight fire, and crime fighters fight crime, what are freedom fighters?
@faulknrgreaves @Hebahersi @IlhanMN @Amy_Siskind @mehdirhasan maybe your fake history is wrong
@JinjoRene Israel does do any evil, in fact, they regularly risk lives to save others.
@faulknrgreaves @Hebahersi @IlhanMN @Amy_Siskind @mehdirhasan Never happened, they are a becon of democracy, and put their lives on the line to save others
@faulknrgreaves @Hebahersi @IlhanMN @Amy_Siskind @mehdirhasan Israel goes out of its way and risks their soldiers lives, even though the Palestinians use human shields.
