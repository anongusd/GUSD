We cannot allow terrorists to regain control of Afghanistan.
Our ongoing efforts in Afghanistan are necessary to ensure another 9/11 does not occur. With threats rising from ISIS-K and other terrorist groups, America’s presence in Afghanistan today is as important as it has ever been to protect the homeland and our allies.
While we all want an end to America’s longest running war, it must be done the right way. Withdrawing half our troops from Afghanistan at this critical time is a major risk that would lead to greater instability and jeopardize America’s national security.

As we celebrate #Thanksgiving, let’s not forget the many who are serving abroad in dangerous places so that we may remain free. I recall this being a particularly tough holiday to be away from family. Today I remain as grateful as ever for those who serve. #NeverForget
On a personal note, this week marks 4th anniversary of the passing of SGM Turner, who was killed in suicide bomb attack outside our base. He was great man and leader, and his sacrifice will never be forgotten. I was glad to see the DFAC at @ResoluteSupport is named in his honor.
When this President provides leadership on important issues, he succeeds (tax cuts, economy, rebuilding military). I strongly encourage him to turn focus more to Afghanistan so that history will show he was the President who successfully ended the longest war in American history.
The American people deserve to know how the South Asia Strategy is working and why our ongoing investment there is important. Either a visit by the President or a presidential address could go a long way to provide this update and assure public that this is too important to fail.
I also repeat my earlier call for the Trump Administration to provide a serious progress report to the American people now that we are more than a year past the announcement of the South Asia Strategy. https://t.co/pLwNdI6dEv
I did hear over and over again that the Administration through @SecPompeo and @VP are very engaged with leaders there and they appreciate their leadership. #Afghanistan
While I’ve been agnostic on recent criticisms of President Trump for not visiting our troops, I do believe it would be helpful to him to better understand the evolving threats in Afghanistan if he saw the situation firsthand, and I will encourage him to do so.
Our ongoing efforts in Afghanistan are necessary to ensure another 9/11 does not occur. I remain committed to supporting these efforts and to seeing a successful conclusion reached there ASAP.
Whether peace with Taliban is realistic or not, it is clear that the mission in Afghanistan of protecting the homeland persists with rising threat of ISIS-K and other groups that pose serious and imminent threats to Americans.
After discussions with @ResoluteSupport @USambkabul and even @ashrafghani, it's clear that there is sense of optimism and reconciliation is within reach due to efforts of @us4afghanpeace and others. This gives hope to many as the recent ceasefire was evidence of some progress.
After visiting troops and leaders on the ground in Afghanistan, I'm convinced our efforts there are as important as ever, as the level of threats has evolved in recent months, but after 17 years the American people are growing even more weary.
While much has changed, too much remains the same in Afghanistan. It’s clear to me that the security situation has deteriorated even further since I was deployed there, and the Taliban has taken footholds in new parts of country since failed Obama strategy of drawdown 5 yrs ago.
Just left Afghanistan with a bipartisan Congressional delegation I led and wanted to share a few raw and unedited thoughts on my first trip back since being deployed there in 2014-15.
After 28 years of Congress asking, the Pentagon released its first ever audit. Though the audit reveals much that must be addressed, I applaud DOD's efforts to account for every dollar, piece of equipment, and payment. Taxpayers deserve transparency.  https://t.co/U4ICYqPeOu

I applaud @RandPaul’s effort to defund Planned Parenthood, the nation’s largest abortion provider. While similar efforts have passed the House on multiple occasions, the Senate has once again failed to act. We need Senators who will stand for human life. https://t.co/xywIfJkknw

Schumer and the Democrats would rather play politics than work on a real solution. They’re pushing a bill that would prohibit the arrest of anyone with a child within 100 miles of the U.S. border, incentivizing human trafficking and illegal immigration to continue.

By focusing on these priorities, along with building a wall and investing in new technology, there is a path forward for Congress to fix our broken immigration system and finally provide true border security. (3/3)
As we work toward a solution, our nation’s immigration laws must be enforced both at the border and throughout the country, which means no amnesty, ending the visa lottery program and ending chain migration.  (2/3)
Republicans are united in the belief that our current immigration policy is outdated, our system needs reformed and the border must be secured. The American people elected a Republican majority with a mandate to fix these problems. (1/3)

(7/7) This freedom will allow Indiana to continue to innovate and provide high quality care for the most vulnerable Hoosiers.
(6/7) Indiana will have more freedom to operate HIP and HIP 2.0 without having to negotiate for a waiver from the federal government.
(5/7) Proposed Medicaid reforms will make HIP and HIP 2.0 permanent by codifying flexibility in Medicaid.
(4/7) Medicaid flexibility will allow states to innovate and ensure that the most vulnerable have access to high quality care.
(3/7) Greater flexibility in Medicaid will allow states to uniquely tailor their programs, just as Indiana has done with HIP and HIP 2.0.
(2/7) The current Medicaid system is broken. Federal mandates have led to reduced access and lower quality of care for the most vulnerable.
