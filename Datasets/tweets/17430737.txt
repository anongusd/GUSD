@wmartin46 @MadHatter9797 @Swamp_Sagacity @Jacks_Bck @DailyCaller The only trial is whether he is insane. Either way he can‚Äôt vote. He is guilty of murder until he is judged insane.
Folks, it doesn‚Äôt matter what party affiliation you have. Registering Nicholas Cruz to vote in July of this year after he murdered 17 people is a cruel stunt or an abysmal mistake. #BrowardElections
@JackPosobiec He should have kept his pretty little mouth shut.
@MadHatter9797 @Swamp_Sagacity @wmartin46 @Jacks_Bck @DailyCaller Let me try to make this crystal clear. Cruz is either criminally insane or a felon. There is no other option for that.  Neither can vote in Florida. Nor can they register to vote.
@MadHatter9797 @Swamp_Sagacity @wmartin46 @Jacks_Bck @DailyCaller He is. Where have you been?  That‚Äôs his whole point, bureaucratic corruption contributed to his daughter‚Äôs death. Registering a felon to vote is a sidebar to his rage.
I have the same view of Donald Trump as I do of JFK, deeply flawed but necessary to break a bad system. Kennedy was a serial philanderer, was alleged to have paid for multiple abortions, may have been guilty of election fraud and the media protected him because he was a Democrat.
@MadHatter9797 @Swamp_Sagacity @wmartin46 @Jacks_Bck @DailyCaller Cruz is an admitted felon. Adjudication is a formality. Not guilty by reason of insanity is, of itself, insane. He is admittedly guilty of the murder of 17 people. For an election official to register him is nauseating. The left is corrupt and nuts.

@NowakVulpix If the background check is clean, they get the gun. Simple. It was the game that drove him nuts. Let‚Äôs ban games. Let‚Äôs require everyone to go through a stress test before getting a gun. Or driving a car or buying a knife. Look at London. They are banning knives. And so on.
@NowakVulpix And gun control works?? Have you been to Central America lately? Or any other place that bans guns, like Chicago.  The only thing that will work is rectifying our society. But that requires people control. Try legislating discipline.

40 % of all weapons possession crimes are committed by blacks. Could this be why police either stop policing or feel more compelled to use deadly force? It‚Äôs time for the black community to face facts and partner with a different political party to help.
FBI murder statistics by race for 2011 show that 4000 murders were committed by whites, vs. 4257 by blacks. Blacks make up only 13% of the population. Blacks commit 37% of all crimes. This is the statistic the black community needs to address. The culture must change.

When a repeat felon with a gun runs from the police, is it excused because he is black?  Failure to follow a lawful order is a misdemeanor. Carrying a weapon unlawfully is a felony. What is so hard for the black community to understand about this.
