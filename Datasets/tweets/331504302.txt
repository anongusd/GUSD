We've never had a President, not in our lifetime, BE talked about like this man is being talked about.
@ChrisCuomo "shutdown the government which would cause the needy and veterans more hardship." How about 1. DO NOT lump veterans up as some social class requiring help 2. DO NOT use you to push your rhetoric.
@ChrisCuomo when you go down to the boarder tomorrow I want to see you take out your checkbook and show us how much you're willing to do for these people
@RepSwalwell @billmaher @HBO @RealTimers So what's ahead? A whole new kind of immaturity?
@RepSwalwell @Disney Guns are not the problem, if they were CA, one of the strictest gun law states in the country, wouldn't have this problem.
@RepSwalwell The 2A is in place for that exact reason. To deter oppression and a tyrannical government. By proposing a confiscation of weapons guaranteed and protected by the 2A you sir are being a tyrant.
@realDonaldTrump come on.... https://t.co/CjSJKTfMMb
@RepStefanik 	This is not the way to control gun violence.	https://t.co/7VEbPG0Iuu
@RepSwalwell @realDonaldTrump You preach FREEDOM FREEDOM FREEDOM, yet your party constantly attacks the 2nd amendment...

@SenMarkey @GOP "millions of young Americans" would not be deported. Millions of people that are not the Citizens you are hurting would be. The men and women that work under me will not be working tomorrow, they will not be paid for tomorrow, they will not be able to pay bills tomorrow.
@SenBlumenthal You are what failed leadership looks like.
Hundreds of thousands of federal employees will not be working tomorrow, because our leaders feel "dreamers" are more important than American families.	#schumershutdown #trumpshutdown #dreamers @SenSchumer @RepStefanik
@SenSchumer Your actions are literally taking food out of Americans mouths to help people that 	are not even citizens of this country.

Day 5- still no Ronin, second round of Pitocin see where it gets us. Hopefully our son will be born by Midnight
@NYGovCuomo Your SAFE Act is garbage. It violates our right to privacy, to bare arms and is ineffective in controlling illegal weapons.
