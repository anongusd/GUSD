"I feel cooler than Burt Reynolds getting to be up here introduced by Donald Trump." -- Vet speaking at Trump event debate.
@eddiecarl4468 a funny joke indeed, but he did stand to the side!
Huckabee (won Iowa caucus in '08), Santorum (won caucus in '12) &amp; Trump (frontrunner in '16) all standing together on same stage right now.
Santorum speaking at Trump's lectern, but he won't stand directly behind it because he doesn't want to be photo'd with the Trump sign.

@robogreen I don't think it's contrarian to think the government should protect speech, even that of people with horrible things to say.

Rick Santorum to Republican National Committee members: "I know this is controversial...I'm actually for a minimum wage increase."
