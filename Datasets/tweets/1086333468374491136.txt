After what happened to Justice Kavanaugh, the Left is NOT getting off the hook so easily. What utter sychophancy and partisan garbage.
Where are all of the hitpieces and excoriating columns condemning @RalphNortham for his White Supremacy? All of sudden actions that happened decades ago are not relevant to the Left? INSUFFERABLE üëè HYPOCRITES üëè.

As I gain more experience, more thoughtful and insightful commentary will manifest. For now, these are my initial thoughts on the matter. #Economics
This thread should not be construed as being necessarily endorsed by @kroger, @Fred_Meyer or any of its affiliates. The views expressed here are my own based on a brief, non scientific  sample size of my work experience.
As it turns out, when corporations drown out everyone else‚Äôs voices with their money as ‚Äúspeech‚Äù for lobbyists, Unions are forced to form in response and donate generously to Democratic campaigns because if they don‚Äôt, corporations win the debate by default.
Full Disclosure Time: I have in the past ideologically opposed Unions as recent as a year ago because of my own perception of their political campaign donations. By working for @kroger and @Fred_Meyer I have begun to realize the importance that legal representation has.
So knowing this, why do we constantly have this cycle between opposition parties where the minority pretends to care about the debt? Nobody gives any Sugar Honey Ice Teas about National Debt. If we did, spending relative to revenue would precipitously decrease post haste.
Specifically, I am referencing opportunity costs, trade-offs and the national debt, which compounds annually at an enormous interest rate. Our federal income taxes only service the interest on the debt. The principal will never get touched.
We have had 1 TRILLION dollar deficits annually for every fiscal year for a long time now. The government was shutdown over 5.7 BILLION  dollars for a wall. Take a moment to consider that. Since when have lawmakers cared about economics?
Conservative hawks should cool their jets over this shutdown ‚Äúcapitulation‚Äù from Trump. He did what was necessary in order to reach a temporary compromise/truce. Political obstinance, whether you believe it is principled or not, is horrible optics.
