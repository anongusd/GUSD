@RealSaavedra Ryan looking at these 3 beautiful women I'm inclined to believe they will just be 1 termers. I'm thinking they all have blonde roots.
@RealSaavedra Her communication skills at least in English leave a lot to be desired. Seems to me she really worrys a lot about racism. Isn't that a form of racism?

@BernieSanders Bernie take a look at  the 45% drop out rates,  that is almost half of the trillions of dollars this program would take to run. You tax that top 10% long enough and the will move to Hong Cong or Singapore. Where's the money come from then?
