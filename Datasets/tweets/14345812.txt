@CCAN @ProfDavidHart "The Post’s editorials have supported the same moderate approach to climate change for a decade. But a decade of mild solutions hasn’t gotten us anywhere, and in that time the climate crisis has grown only more urgent," says @nicoleghio, fossil fuels program manager for @FoE_US. https://t.co/nKwdp9HrUt
@CCAN @ProfDavidHart "After explaining a few of the complexities associated with applying and managing a fair national carbon tax, the editorial let the regulatory cat out of the bag," writes Paul Rankin, president of the Reusable Industrial Packaging Association. https://t.co/QoJu2ZAPH5 https://t.co/EQwWW2ya69
@CCAN @ProfDavidHart "We don’t need more vague, nonbinding resolutions," Janet Gingold writes. "If we want market forces to help solve this problem, we need the cost of burning fossil fuels to include the cost in damage to our planet." https://t.co/QoJu2ZAPH5
@CCAN The basic sequence the board proposed is backward, says @ProfDavidHart. "The United States should focus first on driving down the costs of climate-preserving solutions, then turn its attention to carbon pricing." https://t.co/QoJu2ZAPH5 https://t.co/llRXj2qMl8

RT @AnnTelnaes: #SOTU https://t.co/sDugIf0gTu
If anything, the Editorial Board writes, the #SOTU underscored the need for lawmakers to reclaim Congress’s prerogative on trade, foreign policy and other key issues from an impetuous, drifting president. https://t.co/tHN1TzhmF0
“We can bridge old divisions, heal old wounds, build new coalitions, forge new solutions,” Trump said.		If those were his goals, he would have committed not to declare a phony state of emergency in order to build his wall against congressional wishes. https://t.co/tHN1TzhmF0

"Tonight, the outfits, the guest lists and the facial expressions will tell us as much, if not more, than the words on Trump’s teleprompter." - @AlyssaRosenberg 	https://t.co/IsDHDR5l7r
"I expect a strange and bifurcated speech because President Trump will be calling for civility and shared goals (on infrastructure, for example), even as he continues to divide the country by insisting on his wall." - @EJDionne https://t.co/IsDHDR5l7r
"The devolution of the #SOTU address under this president into pure partisan spectacle gives viewers an opportunity to ask a bigger question: At its best, what value does this annual speech have?" - @mollylroberts	https://t.co/IsDHDR5l7r
"Tonight, President Trump will offer empty paeans to 'unity' and finding 'common ground.' But these are really about seducing centrist commentators into claiming he has 'pivoted.'" - @ThePlumLineGS 	https://t.co/IsDHDR5l7r
"If tonight contains a plea for unity, it’s about three years too late, coming from the most divisive politician in history." - @JRubinBlogger	https://t.co/IsDHDR5l7r
"I’m not watching for memorable lines or gripping moments; I’m planning on using the speech to track how President Trump’s ideology has shifted over time." - @databyler	https://t.co/IsDHDR5l7r
"From President Trump, I’m expecting the usual mix of border fear-mongering and unwarranted self-congratulation — it’s the Democratic response that has the most potential to surprise." - @ChristineEmba https://t.co/IsDHDR5l7r
"President Trump needs to expand his support by about 4 percent to be in a good position for reelection. Tonight’s speech is his best chance to strike the more conciliatory tone that will get him there." - @henryolsenEPPC https://t.co/IsDHDR5l7r
