Greater Boston Refugee Ministry of @egcboston comes alongside resettlement agencies to help, especially after immediate-need stage
Long waits in #refugee camps are quota-driven. Our US limits directly impact all these families fleeing trauma. #welcomeRefugees
#refugee cycle: persecution, trauma &amp; loss in their homeland; flee &amp; seek asylum across a border; average wait in a refugee camp is 17 years
More challenges: language barriers, access to mental &amp; physical health care, affordable housing, getting kids in schools #welcomeRefugees
Core stressors for recently-arrived #refugees: dealing w/past trauma, lack of social supports, isolation, discrimination, cultural barriers
#refugees in US have to begin repaying their travel expenses to US starting 6 months after they arrive here
#refugee services for 90 days, then usually families are on their own

@omylola nope!!
@united haven't heard anything since my last email - I'm ok with a process taking some time but would be nice to know what's going on
Totally understand normal air traffic delays! But 2 different @united staff confirmed our booking &amp; turned out untrue. This is not okay.
Emailed @united with our whole story (case 11735613) and no reply since my last email on Thursday
Missed a whole day of our trip to meet new niece - vacation time is precious &amp; so is this new little one we went to meet!
Delayed 24 hours due to this wrong info from @united agents - had to stay overnight in a hotel at our own expense, with no luggage!
2 @United agents told us we had seats on a flight (Feb 15) then turned away at the gate. Waited hours for customer service.
So frustrated w/ @united customer service! Waiting 4 days to hear back from my last email.

"Eat all the fruit you want. It’s only when you turn it into juice that I have a problem with it, because then it loses its fiber."
"Fiber mitigates the negative. The way God made it, whatever sugar is in a piece of fruit, there’s an equal amount of fiber to offset it."
"People always say to me, 'What about fruit? It has sugar.' But I have nothing against fruit, because it comes with its inherent fiber."
"A bowl of Fruit Loops and an eight-ounce glass of orange juice. That’s 11 teaspoons of added sugar. This is what we have to fix."
