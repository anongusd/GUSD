While Democrats cast blame and obstruct progress, President @realDonaldTrump stands for the victims of our porous borders, like the Angel Families of those killed by illegal immigrants.  #SOTU
4,000 violent killings by illegal aliens is not a "manufactured crisis." Neither are the 30,000 sex crimes and 100,000 assaults committed by criminal aliens over the past two years. We're in the middle of a border crisis, and it's time to take action. #BuildTheWall #SOTU

We require sex offenders to register because it WORKS. It shouldn’t matter if they’re here legally or illegally – rapists and child molesters are a threat regardless immigration status. Those here illegally shouldn't be given an opportunity to bypass registration requirements.
My bill – HR 6595, the Sex Offender Registration &amp; Victim Protection Act (SORVPA) – strengthens accountability in #ICE’s handling of sex offenders, promotes better communication with local law enforcement, enhances public safety &amp; empowers future victims→ https://t.co/W6pBDHRYQg
Tragically, #ICE’s process for releasing sex offenders is overly complex &amp; seriously flawed. As a result, local law enforcement too often don't even know these criminals are in the community, allowing them to avoid registration. I’ve introduced new legislation to set this right.
It’s all too easy for dangerous criminals to slip through the cracks &amp; avoid registering as sex offenders. While Miguel Luna will spend his life behind bars, many other rapists and child molesters here illegally will one day be released from prison.	https://t.co/MbcUybuZ6w

The conservative principles embodied in the Securing America's Future Act are the right solution &amp; should be the foundation of any future immigration bill. The 193 votes in support of it today prove that we’re close and, with a few tweaks, we could get it across the finish line.
For decades, America has felt the repercussions of a failed, outdated immigration system that has rewarded those who enter this country illegally. While I am disappointed that the Securing America’s Future Act narrowly failed, I will continue to work with my colleagues.

Since @realDonaldTrump has taken office, ISIS has lost the vast majority of the territory it once controlled in Iraq and Syria – just another way that this administration has demonstrated its commitment to strengthening global and national security. #SOTU

Since the beginning of this Congress, House and Senate Republicans have rolled back dozens of burdensome, Obama-era regulations that have stifled growth and hiked up costs. In fact, in 2017 alone, more than 600 regulations were withdrawn! It's time to unleash American innovation!
Veterans represent the very best of our Nation – and deserve the very best we have to offer them. It’s time to put those words into action and ensure that every single servicemember receives treatment we would all be proud of when they return home. #SOTU
"In God We Trust," said @realDonaldTrump. AMEN! #SOTU
Did you know that small businesses create roughly half of all jobs in the U.S.? That's why the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act is lowering their tax rates - which previously could reach as high as 44%! Through #TaxReform, Congress is putting more money back in your pocket! #SOTU
