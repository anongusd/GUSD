@McCormickProf This was impressive but little noted. Thank you for bringing it up. Perhaps its a first step back for all of us.
@JamesHasson20 Very insightful. When our high school civics classes teach meaningless PC trivia  rather than an understanding of the founding documents, a respect for the rule of law and purposes of institutions our country suffers badly. This is a choice CA state leaders have made/implemented.
My youngest child turned 24 today. HAPPY BIRTHDAY EMILY! (No...I am mot getting old. I’m not. I’m not. I’m not.)
@jpaceDC @HotlineJosh PLEASE RUN! Race would be referendum on Syrian red lines, nuclear Iran, open borders, Crimea, NorthAfrican collapse that swamped Europe, China expansionism, decline in military preparedness, etc. Also, please persuade Mr. Rhodes to run for something; this could be a 2fer.
@CHIZMAGA @slone Lol.
@erichogue @Rockies @DSweeting My heart is breaking for you. Have a great afternoon!
@JohnCornyn @tabberg For what reason did this young man do this, especially after his acquaintance advised him that he would turn him in if he did it? How disappointing such behavior must be to his parents. Sad.
@cvpayne Very insightful. Well done.
@scottlay Lol
@Ocasio2018 Damn. Every time AOC speaks i have to re-evaluate. AOC’s ability to clarify subjects is truly notable. Can you imagine the opportunities that the national Ds will have with AOC in a leadership position? Pelosi must be terrified! Go AOC! Go to Iowa soon! Please please please.
@cvpayne Mr. Todd is correct. The perception will be that POTUS prevailed and that the Ds lost.
@CrimeADay @pnjaban Are cucumbers even grown in Japan? If so, there’s no way those cucumbers are as good as ones grown in California. Asserting otherwise should be a crime.
@CRTV Who is this person?
@AriFleischer Gibberish. Run Joe run!
@politicalwire I’ll take that gentlemen’s bet.
@AriFleischer This article gets to the heart of the public’s skepticism about current media. The faux journalistic canon of “balance” has undermined quality. Common sense about investigating issues seems to have become uncommon. I am skeptical that Spectator’s challenge will be taken up.
@robport @pnjaban @DNC @HeidiHeitkamp Duh.
@jasonsisney @scottlay As long as one believes that actuarially sound pension obligations should be ignored, then you are correct. Or that the accumulated deferred maintenance on public infrastructure should be ignored, then you are correct. Our leaders are doing all the heavy lifting!
@kcraFinan Recommend you not throw the ice.
@kenjbarnes1 Lol
@CrimeADay @pnjaban I can’t move the kegs fast enough. What is the penalty for not complying?
@AP Lol. I’m sure USG will get right on that.
@DRUDGE_REPORT “We will get that done immediately.” Not.
Press gets to ask questions of elected officials. Press has constitutional prerogative to ask whatever they want. Respondent has freedom to ignore question and say whatever he/she wants. Tough rules but fair.
@capoliticalnews Not if it means her opponent wins. This may very well be a choice of who is the least worst. Sad state of affairs but Feinsteins opponent is ten times worse than her.
Breaking news: TJ Cox, candidate for Congress in California’s 21st District, claims a principal residence in Maryland &amp; gets an annual state of Maryland financial benefit of $692 as a result. Cox claims that’s not true. If not true, then why take the $692? Is this fraud?
@ABC @Heritage On his home server?
The Montana US Senate race appears to be tightening. The crosstabs on independents more or less likely to vote for Testor depending on his Kavanaugh vote would be fascinating to see.
@CrimeADay @pnjaban What about Italian dressing? Surely there is equal treatment before the law.
@kenjbarnes1 @ChickfilA @benandjerrys Lol.
@pnjaban It is fascinating to compare the circumstances of Monahan and Ford. I am unable to reconcile the disparate treatment of the two situations.
@capoliticalnews Feinstein is far better choice than her opponent. I don’t agree w/DF on a lot but I don’t agree w/her opponent on anything. Her opponent is the author of CA sanctuary state. Her opponent is responsible for disgusting culture of sexual abuse at CA State Capitol. Country first.
@GlenSalo @CAGOP If my credible choices are senility vs sophistry, then im going with senility.
@GlenSalo @CAGOP Lol. Thank you for the compliment. Please vote against Kevin Leon.
@capoliticalnews And thereby elect her opponent? Are you kidding me? Neither of them is my first choice. One of them is going to win. Thats the real world. Not voting is not wise. Feinstein, in this instance, is the better choice for our country.
@GOPChairwoman She has totally taken wind out of her opponent’s nonsensical campaign. That she brought it forward into public domain causes total chaos for her opponent, who swept numerous claims of abuse/harassment under the rug for years. Great politics - terrible precedential behavior.
@MattRexroad Lol. Duh.
@cmarinucci @GavinNewsom @hooverwhalen Jimmy Carter, Jr.  Watch.
@scottlay How many of these Senators are on the ballot this year?  Which state(s) are they from?
@kdeleon At least the woman working with Feinstein has a chance at a public discussion. When you were pro tem, you swept all the #MeToo stuff under the rug. Now you want a promotion to the US Senate. No thanks.
@JeffDenham San Fran Man (aka Josh Harder) spends more time campaigning in the Bay Area than in the Central Valley. Harder gets 99% of his campaign $ from SF elites. Harder wants to flush ag water into ocean. Harder Disrespects Sikhs/Hispanic women. Harder campaign coming apart at seams.
@wmarone All you have is all youve ever advocated: tax tax tax tax tax tax tax. You need to join the real world.
@wmarone Tax tax tax tax tax tax tax. Just admit it: thats your answer to everything.
@katiecannon2 @wmarone Are you a policy advisor to Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez? We would be lucky to have her work for us. Pelosi is terrified of her b/c AOC is a true leader! I can’t hardly wait for her to get to DC.
@katiecannon2 @cruickshank Somebody else always gets the bill. What a great system!
@wmarone Lol. Youve got the same answer to every question: new tax, new tax, new tax.
No proponent for alt energy talks abt increases to cost/kwh or cost/gal. Cost of food/fuel is irrelevant to rich people, elected officials and govt employees b/c they know they’re set for life. Spare me your advice about how the teal world should operate; you’re clueless.
@johnmark @cruickshank How do I feed my kids/pay my bills until these new jobs materialize?  Real world is harsh on working poor after 8 yrs of slow GDP growth. Until I know that your new system gives me the opportunity to feed my kids/pay my bills I’m not going to support throwing out current system.
@DonaldJTrumpJr Also, the State of Confusion.
@cruickshank I havent been as fortunate as some. I have kids to feed and bills to pay. As long as your dreamland policies make that more expensive or difficult, I will not be a supporter.
@CNN ACO is so good! Awesome clarity in her answer to the $38 trillion shortfall. She’s the dream candidate for the national Ds. She is an excellent national messenger! Pelosi freezing her out b/c ACO has such obvious leadership skills! I can’t hardly wait until she’s in DC! Go ACO!
@cruickshank What do you do for a living? I work in a park. Cost of power to run the park affects ability to be open. Our customers drive to the park; if fuel cost rises fewer will come. If fewer come jobs are reduced. Your dreamland policy has nightmare real world impacts on working people.
@NRO The law is very clear. Kerry knows the spirit and letter of the law. Since when do perps get a warning? Why is Kerry not being prosecuted?
@charliekirk11 Is ACO a sister of Huma Abedin? Asking for a friend. BTW - ACO should be the national messenger for the D agenda. She’s an absolute genius about how our country works! Pelosi is trying to shut her out b/c ACO is a true leader!
@FinancialTimes Not what a North Korean citizen wants to hear.
@KCBSRadio Their first contact should be Ruby.
@latimes Interesting article. In a state totally controlled by the Democrat hierarchy, Republicans are powerless to address this. Hopefully you’ll stay on this story. My bet is that these indemnities get swept under the same rug as the #MeToo abuse. No wonder people are bailing out of CA.
@CAbobcat Given the choices, I’m voting for Feinstein for US Senate. Her opponent is THE leader of the sexual abusers in the CA State Legislature. So far, the media has given her opponent a pass. That needs to change.
@DanCALmatters That’s a pergect response.
@business “While we love what you do, we have a great community as is. Your demands are excessive. We’ve moved on. Leave us alone.”
@pdanahar @HotlineJosh The Bear always lies.
@matt_weiser @weatherchannel This is an impressive and informative presentation. Anyone who misses the point here is already brain dead. Excellent presentation.
@CrimeADay @pnjaban Do we get the permit from Yogi Bear?
@FinancialTimes Obviously Germany is not a graduate of the Obama/Rhodes School of How It Transpires. Graduates of ORSHIT are so smart its frightening. We’d be lucky to get these leaders to work for us.
@HannahAllam @BuzzFeedBen What class did she teach? Does anyone have a course syllabus? Has anyone talked to her students about what they learned? Why is it so hard to get straight answers from Spanberger about this?
@CrimeADay What is the punishment for violating this law?
@joshua_harder San Fran Man (aka Josh Harder) supports flushing ag water into ocean. Harder shipped US jobs overseas in prior career. Harder gets 99% of his campaign $ outside district. Harder campaigns in the   Bay Area with most anti-ag member of Congress. Harder is bad news for ag.
@MuhammadLila @slone I know I speak for my friends and family in saying I have not forgotten how Canada responded. Thank you.
17 years later, it’s still raw. God bless the United States of America.
@kenjbarnes1 How were the roads? If the argument is that these taxes are needed to maintain our roads, then what is the condition of the roads in states that don’t have the gas tax? Their roads must be an absolute disaster, if pro-tax arguments are to be believed.
@MattRexroad Yes
@TimRunsHisMouth @slone Remind me who is older: David Hogg or Alexandra Ocasio-Cortez? Doesn’t really matter because these two are true leaders. I hope the national D leadership recognizes their talent and puts them on the road in swing districts as the messengers.
@LaCivitaC What class did she teach? Can someone share the class syllabus? I’m curious about the course content.
@CrimeADay @EWErickson It would be very informative if you included what the penalty is for violating this federal law. Is it lawful for a person with a new burlap bag obtained in South Carolina to put it over her head when the Sacramento Kings play the Warriors? Asking for a friend.
@RealSaavedra Dear Mr. President: the deaths of Stevens, Woods, Smith and Doherty are not theoretical.
@realDonaldTrump This, finally, is the essence of these so-called trade wars. President Trump is right on the button calling this out. It would be highly informative to have more such disclosures on a product by product basis. Keep up the good work!
@RichardGrenell @realDonaldTrump How hard can it be to say “radical Islamic terrorist”?  How about “Islamic jihadist terrorist”?
@DRUDGE_REPORT @tabberg When he enters a room, it gets terribly crowded.
@latimes @AbcarianLAT Yes! Yes! Yes! Come save us! It would be so great to have you and Ocasio-Cortez be the messengers for the national D agendas. The American voter craves your return!
@jasonlarrabee @joshua_harder I think a better question for San Fran Man (aka Josh Harder) is: Did you ever vote for Obama for president? It should be easy to check voting records. Then we would know if he’s being disingenuous again. How about it @ModestoBee? Tell us when and where San Fran Man voted.
@larryelder This is do good. Thank you!
@RichardGrenell @pnjaban The Bear always lies.
@reason I readily avknowledge that POTUS has far more info available to him on the Syrian situation than any citizen, including me. I accept that we have interests that must be defended. However, I am very tired of “war” being the apparent dominant plank of American foreign policy.
@JeffDenham @joshua_harder San Fran Man (aka Josh Harder) made money sending US jobs overseas. Harder supports flushing ag water into ocean. Harder says he’ll vote for the district’s interests but rarely votes in the district to date. Harder gets 99% of campaign $ outside district. Harder bad news for ag.
San Fran Man (aka Josh Harder) suppprts &amp; opposes flushing ag water into ocean (per Mod Bee), supports &amp; opposes sending US jobs overseas (per Riverbank News), raises less than 1% of campaign $ from district, gets talking pts from enviro extremists. Harder is bad news for ag.
MSM is reporting on abysmal working conditions for employees making Nike shoes: 80 hour workweek, pay is 20 cents per hour. I sure hope so-called progressive Democrats like Senator Wyden and Senator Merkley do something about this!
@kdeleon Walking out is your pattern. You walked out on your responsibilities to stop the culture of sexual harassment at CA State Capitol while you were pro tem. You failed in your duty/have refused to take responsibility for that failure. Now you want to be a US Senator? No thanks.
@nytimes The Bear always lies.
@ChadPergram And then democracy intervenes, the Committee takes a vote on the motion, the motion fails and the Mob objects. Harris et al are throwing Donnelly et al under the bus. This is the first inning. McConnell prevails in the end using D votes. Thank you, Harry Reid.
@CrimeADay @pnjaban Likely Punishment for willfully violating this law is that violators will be required to only employ recent SF public high school graduates with median academic records as your work force.
@SacBeeEditBoard @realDonaldTrump The Bee asserts that the federal govt has no voice in CA water issues while simultaneously asserting that every individual/group other than the federal govt gets to speak, except for Republican officeholders. CK is rolling over in his grave seeing this dismal effort by B Ed Bd.
It’s Labor Day! San Fran Man  (aka Josh Harder) pairs up w/Pelosi, Lee for events in SF Bay Area. Harder is no-show at debates in district. Harder wants to flush ag water into ocean. Harder calls farmers stupid, disrespects Hispanics/Sikhs, dodges debates. Harder bad news for ag.
@SpeakerBoehner Good looking ride! Hope allbis well.
@JeffDenham My thanks to Duke for his service. San Fran Man (aka Josh Harder) needs to meet Duke. Harder doesn’t show up; Duke could teach him how.
Has SanFranMan (aka Josh Harder) disappeared completely? Harder skips debates, isn’t even campaigning in the district. Harder is in Bay Area w most anti-ag member of Congress. Harder campaign is collapsing. Somebody needs to watch campaign $ before it disappears like Harder has.
@sahilkapur If the national Ds had put up virtually any candidate except the fundamentally flawed Clinton, would that person now be President and enjoy the prerogative of nominating SCOTUS justices? We will never know. It sure seems like the national Ds “have no one to blame but themselves.”
@kdeleon How’s the #MeToo thing going for you? You have yet to explain your leadership of the CA State Capitol culture of sexual harassment that developed while you were pro tem. Now you want a promotion to the US Senate? No thanks.
@larryelder That wasn’t a bar. It was the Grifter Hall of Fame.
@RiegerReport Warren sees the danger to her presidential aspirations and gets her ideological pals to assert there is no story here. This whitewash won’t sell in flyover country. Thank you for reminding us of her grifty-ness.
@DanCALmatters If the city is going to tax vacancies, then is it going to reward occupancies?
@CBSSacramento Everybody desires a clean atmosphere. Those who work for govt will always get paid. Those in the private sector who’s job is tied to the price and availability of energy will pay the price.
@TheBabylonBee This has to be a SNL parody. No one is that......(what’s the word).....
@JeffDenham San Fran Man (aka Josh Harder) gets virtually all of his campaign $ and elected official endorsements from outside district, like Namcy Pelosi and Barbara Lee. Harder calls farmers stupid, attacks Hispanic women, supports flushing ag water into ocean. Harder is bad news for ag.
@DailyCaller Ivory Tower vs Real World.
@RedState Actually, I live in Sacramento. That’s in CA where the elected State Ds play make believe everyday: raising fuel taxes while running a budget surplus, releasing criminals from prison as crime rises, refusing to build water storage in an arid state, ignoring fire fuel issue.
@CrimeADay @pnjaban What if you’re color-blind? What shade of black must the tail be? Are the boundaries of the District clearly marked? Am i correct that its ok to shoot a black-tailed prairie dog outside the District? Has anyone ever been charged with this heinous act?
@JeffDenham I don’t understand how San Fran Man (aka Josh Harder) can find his way to Oakland to campaign w/the  most anti-ag member of Congress but can’t figure out how to show up for a candidate debate. Voters see the dodge. Harder’s campaign is collapsing. Harder pro-Pelosi, anti-farmer.
@HotlineJosh There must be something really interesting in these documents to generate this much attention.
@MoRocca Nancy Pelosi and Olive Oyl.
@RadioFreeTom Don’t you live in Rhode Island? Rhode Island isnt sending any Republican anywhere anyway so whats the big deal about you announcing that youre not voting for any republican? Thats why I so greatly appreciate the secret ballot. Nobody can verify/disprove your assertion.
@joshrogin @HotlineJosh @vkaramurza @DemocracyPost The Bear always lies.
@reason Is her campaign a SNL skit?
@MZHemingway @DailyCaller No?!?!? Really?!?!?
@CrimeADay @pnjaban That solved a puzzle.
San Fran Man (aka Josh Harder) outed by the Mod Bee: Raises 1% of campaign $ from district; Supports flushing ag water into ocean; Sends US jobs overseas as vent capitalist; Calls farmers stupid; Attacks Hispanic women. All signs of collapsing campaign. Harder is bad news for ag.
@ReutersBiz Submit the final product to the Senate.
@HotlineJosh Is Pittsburgh larger than Sacramento? Asking for a friend.
@MeetThePress @HillaryClinton Respectfully, i do not want to hear from Hillary Clinton about anything.
@MSNBC Dont do the crime if you cant do the time. Anyway, i hear the food ain’t all that good. And, why is anyone surprised by complaints by inmates about the length of their sentence? Hey Al - pay your taxes.
@RobStutzman The Bear always lies.
@bethanyshondark @pnjaban AOC has been sat down and advised of a better way to comminicate. Do not underestimate her.
@nedryun @pnjaban Yes. This would be informative.
America thrives from the contributions of dedicated patriots like John McCain. We lost a good one today. Rest in Peace. God Bless John McCain.
San Fran Man (aka Josh Harder) has been called out by the Modesto Bee. Harder’s a one percenter! Harder’s raised one percent of his campaign funds from within the district. Now Harder has flipflopped on water: Harder was for flushing ag water into ocean before he was against it.
@kdeleon @DianneFeinstein Youre running on the basis of: fostering and protecting a culture of sexual harassment at state capitol, doing nothing about catastrophic wildfire, opposing new water storage, and imposing higher gas prices. Wrong positions on major policies. No thanks.
Watching the best movie ever right now: The Martian. I appreciate it more every time I watch it. It’s got it all: science, faith, disappointment, perseverance, triumph.
@MSNBC Based on his track record for President Obama, i seriously doubt he’s The Brain behind anything.
@CrimeADay @pnjaban Nope. I’m not going to say it.
While I have a righteous respect for players’ free speech rights, I have been very displeased with the manner in which the protests have occurred. I’m supporting the boycott of the NFL on Sunday, November 11, 2018. I have rights, too.
@CrimeADay @pnjaban But but but....some days it is therapeutic. On those days, can i be arrested?
San Fran Man (aka Josh Harder) wants to flush ag water into ocean. Water is nothing to Harder b/c has academic job. Harder gets paid whether there’s water or not. Now Harder wants promotion &amp; raise but will put farmers out of business. Harder bad news for ag, disrespects farmers.
@jimgeraghty Why does this perspective surprise anyone? The Bear always lies.
@scottlay Duncan Hunter, Jr., deserves this. He earned it. I will watch the election outcome with interest. I wish Issa or DeMaio would run a write in campaign.
@SalenaZito @Rep_Hunter This is a serious issue, given Hunter’s  committee assignments. It’s why Speaker Ryan acted. Thank you, Speaker Ryan.
@DailyCaller Please do.
RT @DougOse: I am truly impressed by the degree of understanding about regular peoples’ lives that many elected officials/candidates posses…
SanFranMan (aka Josh Harder) keeps failing: supports flushing ag water into ocean, attacks Hispanic women, dodges debates, raises virtually all campaign $ elsewhere, calls farmers stupid, disrespects Sikhs, wants SF values for Central Valley. Harder is bad news for ag. @modbee
@rkylesmith @slone Breaking news: Elizabeth Warren’s presidential strategy does not rely on doing well in Iowa
Kate Steinle. Maggie Tibbetts. Hundreds more over the past 10 years. When will our elected leaders do something about this? How many more have to die before our leaders act?
@cbudoffbrown @ccadelago @MKarnitschnig Germany is in Russia’s geopolitical crosshairs. Merkel recognizes that Germany doesn’t want to be a Russian vassal state. US ambassador doing an excellent job tending to this relationship, so far. I hope this effort continues. Never forget: the Bear always lies.
@FOX40 Lesson #1: don’t be a Nazi. 	Outcome #1: we found you.  Lesson #2: don’t break our laws.	Outcome #2: you will be deported.
@amber_athey @DailyCaller All those who wish to come to the United States have a choice: follow our laws and try to come here legally, or ignore our laws and try to come here illegally.
@MelodyGutierrez 12 members took a walk. Profiles in courage.
SanFranMan (aka Josh Harder) having a bad wk again. Harder supports flushing ag water into ocean, dodges debates, disrespects Hispanic women, ignores Sikhs. Today’s Bee piles on w disclosure that Harder raises virtually all his campaign $ from Bay Area. Harder is bad news for ag.
@CAFarmBureau @CaRicefarmer71 Was San Fran Man (aka Josh Harder) there is explain why he supports the SWRCB proposal? If I’m a farmer and a candidate said he supported flushing ag water into the ocean, I’d be voting for someone else. Three weeks ago, San Fran Man (aka Josh Harder) said he supports SWRCB.
@Nicurnmama @FOX40 Fact: (1)Manteca did the right thing by having the event;(2)Denham did the right thing by being there;(3)San Fran Man (aka Josh Harder) dodged the event. If I were Sikh, I’d make sure San Fran Man (aka Josh Harder) heard my voice at ballot box. Denham showed up, Harder didn’t.
@Nicurnmama @FOX40 That is lamest excuse ever for the non-appearance of San Fran Man (aka Josh Harder). Facts are: Denham came &amp; paid his respects, Harder stayed away. One of the worst assaults ever in Manteca &amp; Harder didn’t show up to support the victim. Harder can’t make time, just excuses.
@joelpollak @pnjaban @BreitbartNews I have virtually no policy agreements with Nancy Pelosi. I have battled her in the political arena to a virtual standoff, though she won. No one is entitled to belittle someone this way. Because if we’re going to belittle anyone, perhaps we’re going to start with young Mr. Hogg.
@kfbk Particularly bad in Sacramento in the area bounded by L Street - 10th Street - N Street - 15th Street.
I am truly impressed by the degree of understanding about regular peoples’ lives that many elected officials/candidates possess when they have spent their entire adult lives either in office or as a political hack. We are really fortunate to get these folks to work for us.
@SebGorka @HectorMBarajas If he signs with an NFL team, this is the last I will see of him. Good job Officer!
Hard to grasp why our CA elected leaders think raising the price of electricity helps the people who live here. CA power prices strongly influence whether a manufacturing business expands here or somewhere else. Jobs are on the line. Who’s side are our leaders on?
@CBSSacramento Denham was there. San Fran Man (aka Josh Harder) didn’t show up. So far this week Harder has: said farmers are stupid, disrespected Hispanic women, dodged debates. Harder campaign has all the signs of collapsing. Hearing nat’l Ds have had enough and are moving $ elsewhere.
@FOX40 San Fran Man (aka Josh Harder) skipped this event just like he dodges debates. So far this week he’s called farmers stupid, disrespected Hispanic women, promised to flush ag water into ocean. Harder campaign is collapsing. Hearing Nat’l Ds are moving money elsewhere.
@KCRALuery Denham was there paying his respects. San Fran Man (aka Josh Harder) skipped it. Harder disrespects Hispanic women, farmers and Sikhs all in one week. Harder wants to flush ag water into ocean. Harder is bad news for ag. Hearing nat’l Ds have had enough, are moving $ elsewhere.
@HMSPitts @tabberg I am getting sick + tired of all the criticisms + insults of AOC. She is a prototypical “next generation” American leader! Establishment Ds are trying to make a mockery of her based on facts but she continues to respond w/intelligence + insight gained over her lifetime. Go AOC!
RT @CollinIngram: HELP ME PLEASE. COORS FIELD NEEDS AN ORGANIST https://t.co/C5Gvc3ysyj
@CrimeADay I’m glad this is written down.
@JoeKhalilTV @FOX40 @RepJeffDenham San Fran Man (aka Josh Harder) disrespects Sikhs skipping Manteca event. Harder supports flushing ag water, attacks Hispanic women, dodges debates, gets talking pts from extreme enviros. Harder campaign collapsing. Hearing nat’l Ds have had enough, moving $ elsewhere. Its over.
@newsbusters Congressman Hastings was a federal judge who was removed from the bench due to US Senate conviction.
@slone @realDonaldTrump Security clearances are not a game. Many who work for POTUS are focused on national security issues. Above all else, POTUS gets to question their input. It seems to me that POTUS is allowed to trust or not trust them. If they aren’t trusted, then they get removed.
@GOPLeader @cmarinucci There is no way that Nancy Pelosi knows more about how Twitter operates than Kevin McCarthy does. The press should corner both of them and grill them about the details of how Twitter works. The interviews could be played side by side. It would be great TV!
@CrimeADay @pnjaban “Be advised: if you can read this sign, then you’re in range.”
@BreitbartNews You would have more credibility if you paid your federal taxes.
@alexbreitler @matt_weiser San Fran Man (aka Josh Harder) supports flushing 40% of ag water into ocean. He attacks Hispanic Women. Harder thinks farmers are stupid. Harder gets big $ from Pelosi/talking Pts From extreme Enviros. Harder now Dodging Debates. Harder campaign showing signs of Imploding.
@CNN The Bear always lies.
@Heritage The Bear always lies.
@AnthonyCannella @MattRexroad Is it true that San Fran Man (aka Josh Harder) will be there to explain his support of the water grab?
@JeffDenham SanFranMan (aka Josh Harder) keeps talking: says flush ag water into ocean (he said it 3 wks ago);Harder attacks Hispanic women (2 wks ago);Harder said farmers stupid (1 wk ago);Harder dodging debates.Harder gets big $ Pelosi/talking pts extreme enviros.Harder is bad news for ag
@PeterGleick @matt_weiser “Breaking news: scientists have determined that fires burn hotter and faster when fuel is extremely dry due to 5 year drought.”
@NBCNightlyNews Please proceed. You can fund your retirement by selling pay per view tickets to the depositions and crossexamination.
@MarcosBreton Lol. I loved it.
@thehill Wow! AOC sees the press as a threat. We need to listen to her. She’s a great leader with expetience and wisdom to share. I hope the national Ds put her up as “the messenger” for 2018. When she gets to DC she’ll show Pelosi/Warren/Harris what real leadership is! Go AOC!
@PeterGleick @matt_weiser Peter - That’s not what they said. You know that’s not what they said. Your idea to continue doing what we’ve been doing and ignore impact of drought as a solution to reducing fire danger has to be purposefully stupid. Matt - you know the problem yet you remain mute.
@foonrhee This is probably the least well thought editorial ever printed in Sacto Bee, &amp; that’s a high bar. Continuing to do the same as we have for years &amp; blithely dismiss impact of drought on forest health as a solution is stupid. You need to recalibrate your view from the ivory tower.
San Fran Man (aka Josh Harder) has been skipping campaign debates. Harder doesnt want to explain: why he supports flushing ag water into ocean, why he attacks Hispanic women, why he thinks farmers are stupid, why is Pelosi dumping money into his campaign. Harder bad news for ag.
@EWErickson Awesome! The story at some point of Everyboy. Thank you.
@JeffDenham San Fran Man (aka Josh Harder) supports flushing ag water into ocean, said it 3 wks ago. Harder gets campaign $ from Pelosi/talking pts from extreme enviros. Harder attacks Hispanic women/calls farmers stupid. Harder dodges debates. Classic signs of a collapsing campaign.
@ericgarcetti @cmarinucci @VanJones68 Hello Mr. Mayor. How are you doing with the reforms to public pensions? I know you realize current program is unsustainable. This problem is definitely within your jurisdiction. What is your plan? When will you share it?
@JohnStossel @pnjaban You need to stop badgering AOC! She’s new kind of American leader wexperience &amp; great vision. Establishment wants to fact check her to death but we know that’s people like Pelosi/Warren protecting themselves. AOC needs to get to DC &amp; show Pelosi/Warren what leadership really is!
@CAFarmBureau @JDJohansson @NutFarmerJake San Fran Man (aka Josh Harder) supports water grab. Harder said so 3 wks ago. Now he’s flip flopped on issue/started attacking Hispanic women. Harder called farmers stupid 2 days ago. Harder gets campaign $ from Pelosi/talking pts from extreme enviros. Harder is bad news for ag.
@FoxNews @slone The Bear always lies.
@BenjySarlin @guypbenson Absolutely disagree. AOC is new style leader who shouldn’t be held to traditional rules based on fact or logic. She’s a great leader! I hope the national Ds make her “the messenger” for 2018! Pelosi/Warren/Sanders need to step aside for new American socialist leadership. Go AOC!
@nytimes The Bear always lies.
@jmartNYT Always. The People’s House.
Thank you, President Bush 41 for your leadership 27 years ago this day. Right guy in the right place at the right time who was ready. You made a difference.
@WestWingReport Keep in mind how President Bush did not overreact to the attempted coup. This was classic leadership schooled in the limits of power. This could have quickly dissolved into worldwide catastrophe. I am grateful: right guy in the right place at the right time who was ready.
@TeamPelosi @cmarinucci Crumbs. Silence on Keith Ellison. This woman pays over $100k per year in CA property taxes on her various houses. She only travels with armed security. She wants to recreate in your community what has happened in SF. She is not “for the People”. She had her chance. Time for AOC!
@Sacbiz There are GooGoo Clusters in there. Get out of my way!
@PolitiFact @realDonaldTrump I don’t care what it looks like. Just go get Mark Watney!
@nytimes AOC apparently shares the widespread view that MSM can’t be trusted. This woman is such a leader! We’d be lucky to get her to work for us! I hope the national Ds let her be “the messenger” for 2018. She has to better than that faker Warren or Old Man Sanders. Go AOC!
San Fran Man (aka Josh Harder) keeps talking: Supports flushing ag water into ocean, attacks Hispanic women, calls farmers stupid, gets campaign $ from Pelosi, gets talking pts from extreme enviros, loves “SF values” (whatever that is), dodges debates. Sad to watch. @modbee
@KCRATeSelle @CrackerBarrel @kcranews CRACKER BARREL IS OPEN! GOOGOO CLUSTERS! GET OUT OF MY WAY!

@TomPerez I love what you’re doing to Keith Ellison. After this, no one would dare challenge you for chairman.
@CrimeADay @pnjaban What is the punishment for violating this law? Don’t do the crime if you can’t do the roost.
@RepJeffDenham @SecretarySonny SanFranMan (aka Josh Harder) wants ag H2O flushed into ocean. Harder doesnt understand CentVlly needs. Harder gets campaign $ from SanFranNan/talking pts from extreme enviros.Harder is bad news for ag. Harder attacks Hispanic women/calls farmers dumb. Harder campaign collapsing.
@JeffDenham San Fran Man (aka Josh Harder) supports flushing ag water into ocean. Harder supports Pelosi for speaker w SF values leading to rampant homelessness/street feces. Harder attacks Hispanic women. Harder dodges debates. Now Harder calls farmers stupid? Harder campaign is collapsing.
@MarcosBreton Loony tune enabler of sexual predators? Kevin Leon.
@HenryJGomez @BuzzFeedBen I hope Clinton runs again. She wouldn’t win the D nomination. Then, finally, we’d be done with them.
@TheEconomist King George rolling over in his grave. Lafayette is saying “You don’t get it.” de Tocqueville is laughing at it. Andrew Jackson is asking “Did you ever hear of New Orleans?” John Paul Jones is saying “You want some more?” Truman is saying “Shut up.” Eisenhower is saying “Stop”.
@brhodes Respectfully, Mr. Rhodes: do you have any comment regarding the ISIS fighter who slipped into the US as a refugee only to be discovered as a participant in civilian murders during battle for Mosul and is now being extradited back to Iraq to stand trial?
@sarahjeong Impressively erudite. You should write for an editorial board.
@STEPHMHAMILL @DailyCaller @keithellison @womensmarch @DNC Why has Nancy Pelosi gone mute over this? Her daughter Christina has been righteous on this issue that Kevin Leon allowed to be created in CA State Senate. I just don’t understand why San Fran Nan has gone silent.
@esaagar Paging Mr. Ben Rhodes. Paging Mr. Ben Rhodes. How did this guy get past all the extra vetting President Trump put in place? Take your time. I’ll wait.
@JeffDenham @modbee San Fran Man (aka Josh Harder) wants to flush ag water into ocean. Harder’s campaign collapsing as voters in Central Valley realize he gets his campaign $ from San Fran Nan &amp; his talking pts from extreme enviros. Now he’s attacking Hispanic women. Harder is bad news all around.
@DLoesch @DailyCaller Recall starting in ...3....2....1
@JeffDenham @TheHouseModesto San Fran Man (aka Josh Harder) doesnt show for debate b/c he didnt want to explain why he wants to flush ag water into ocean, why he is attacking Hispanic women, why he takes his campaign $ from San Fran Nan/his talking pts from enviro extremists. Harder campaign is collapsing.
San Fran Nan is the leader of the Democratic team: highest ranking, best fundraiser, etc. The q I have is: what is she there? Is she there just to oppose Trump? Is she there to advance young people like AOC? Is she there b/c she likes power? Again, why is she there?
“That’s the ball game!”
@CapitolAlert Are civil cases open to the media?
@GreatShelbini Hanson 2 Dodgers 1.
Second worst 5 word sentence in Giants’ lexicon: “The Dodgers tie it up.”
@BrandonRittiman @ABC10 @UCBerkeley @CAL_FIRE Wait a minute! Does Prof Stephens realize the apostasy he is saying? He’s going to lose his tenure over this!
Game on! Go Giants!
@toreyvanoot When will the video be released?
@latimespolitics This should be an interesting series of depositions. The cross examination should bevon pay per view.
@CrimeADay @pnjaban What must a llama do to be put in a maximum security facility? I own two and need to be prepared. BTW - i really appreciate the federal govt convening the Llama Behavioral Correction Committee. The Committee has made my life so much safer.
@RealSaavedra @pnjaban Not going to happen.  Perez is going  to leave Ellison out there to slowly twist in the Wind.  Payback.
@notpeterstrzok @scottlay Please do. The depositions and cross examination will be brutal.
@kdeleon The fires are fed by built up fuel. As pro tem, you passed on getting anything done to reduce the fire danger. Perhaps you were too busy sweeping under the rug the culture of sexual harassment that developed while you were pro tem. Now you want to be a US Senator. No thanks.
@AHMalcolm San Fran Nan’s district has unaffordable housing, rampant homelessness &amp; feces in the street. Its hard to understand how this is the leader of the party of Truman and JFK.Supporting her candidate in swing districts will get you “SF in your neighborhood”. Not the outcome you want.
San Fran Man (aka Josh Harder) wants to flush ag water into ocean. Harder gets his campaign $ from San Fran Nan. San Fran Nan tells Harder what to do. If you want SF Nan policies, then move to SF. Central Valley has its own way; we dont want SF values. Harder is bad news for ag.
@kdeleon Since you presided over the culture of sexual harassment at the CA State Capitol, do you have any comment regarding the allegations against Keith Ellison?
@RobStutzman Wait a minute! Rob Stutzman is Stephen Miller’s uncle?!?!?!?
@rsg I served in the House with your dad. He is one of the most effective Members of this Congress and is respected on both sides of the aisle. I speak from direct experience rather than media reports. I never heard him say anything about you other than how proud he is of your work.
@RLHeinrichs The speaker has a name.  The speaker works somewhere or is a trust fund baby. Who is he?
@JeffDenham San Fran Man (aka Josh Harder) gets campaign $/talking pts from extreme enviros. Harder wants to send ag H2O into ocean/attacks Hispanic women. Harder campaign collapsing: the more you know, the faster voters run away. Farmers, women, Hispanics, Sikhs get it: Harder is bad news.
@BuzzFeedPol I hear there is video.
@DRUDGE_REPORT I heard there is video.
@AP There is talk about a video of this abusive incident. Has anyone found evidence of this video?
@dcexaminer @slone Lol. He didn’t read it. A staffer told him about it. He asked for a briefing on it. He picked out what he wanted and talked to the press. BTW - what is the status on investigation of Mrs. Sanders college?
Interesting political developments in Pakistan w election. Traditional leading Pak families pushing back. PRC loaning billions/building up Gwadar port at entrance to Persian Gulf. Russians just west in Iran. Everyone wants naval facilities at entrance to Persian Gulf.
@kenrudin Lol.
@JMilesColeman Lol. Thats funny!
@joelpollak @pnjaban @BreitbartNews Does Ocasio-Cortez share Tlaib’s views on Israel? @JoeCrowleyNY you have a line. Run Joe run!
@robbystarbuck @slone @DNC @keithellison There are suggestions of a video tape having been recorded.
@JMilesColeman Has to be vote tampering! AOC endorsed someone else who must have gotten more votes! AOC is the future. Great presence/message! I hope Democratic Party of Truman/JFK makes her a leader. She understands economy and geopolitics. Put her on TV! Pelosi’s days are numbered! Go AOC!
@FinancialTimes If I were Putin, this is precisely the article that I would want major publications to carry. It is stunningly incomplete in terms of financial impact upon Russia of a continuing decline in sales of Russian natural gas into Europe.
@omriceren @pnjaban @WSJ Paging Ben Rhodes. Paging Ben Rhodes. You’re tenure is over (thank goodness!). You lied to us. You ignored advice from people who actually knew the subject matter. Your hubris caused enormous damage. You refuse to take responsibility for your actions. That’s a red line. Go away.
@jpodhoretz @HotlineJosh Concur.
Nonscientific survey of friends under 30 this past week reveals significant embarassment that Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez has become the face of their generation. One caveat: all polled are entrepreneurs/employed with significant college backgrounds in economics and finance.
Fascinating to watch the continuing circus that is AOC. Blows into Hawaii like a hurricane, leaves like a misbehaving puppy. Keeps her perfect endorsement record alive. @JoeCrowleyNY - you need to run. Youve got a line. Run Joe run!
@SacNewsReview This is very informative. Thank you Jeff (yes, i do read SNR). Next step is identify specific cost drivers, including tort reform, and get them under control. Govt has no business mandating services/ setting prices but could play a role with price disclosure. Put prices on web.
@CrimeADay @jpitney Finally a law that makes me feel safer for its existence.
@KQED Uh oh. Looks like a possible job opening.
San Fran Man (aka Josh Harder) wants to send ag water into ocean/is race shaming Hispanic women. Harder gets campaign $/talking pts from extreme enviros. Harder bad news for Central Valley ag &amp; dismissive of Hispanics. Pelosi’s House Majority PAC will spend million$ to hide him.
@Matt_Cagle @sacbee_news @maassive Article says use of this tech is case by case. Article says 37% of the cases indicated fraud. Article says each case is reviewed for appropriate use. Solution? If you dont want to be investigated for fraud, then dont engage in fraudulent behavior. Keep investigating fraud cases.
@JeffDenham San Fran Man (aka Josh Harder) wishes he had this kind of support! Harder got called out for being anti-ag and anti-Hispanic. Now his campaign is collapsing. He’s trying to $ from Pelosi/extreme enviros. Harder is bad for Central Valley ag and downright rude to Hispanic women.
San Fran Man (aka Josh Harder) wants to flush ag water into ocean. Now he attacks his opponent’s spouse - makes statement like a 1930s southern plantation owner.  Harder is anti-water 2 wks ago, anti-Hispanics now. Harder’s campaign is collapsing. Sad to watch such behavior.
@sactotrixie @keckery @SFGiants Be strong, Carol. Make him sleep on the couch!
@kdeleon When Legislature passes &amp; Governor signs legislation that enormously complicates clearing underbrush &amp; dead trees in rural areas, you get catastrophic fires. You were Pro Tem in CA State Senate. You supported making clearing difficult. Now you want to be a US Senator. No thanks.
@kdeleon @billmckibben Every other state wants CA to go 100% renewable while they stay with traditional generation. Their manufacturers will pay 30% less for power than manufacturers in CA. What a great way to increase employment in other states! Thanks a lot!
@AP I hope it hurt.
@kfbk Welcome to the club, Mr. and Mrs. Knavs. We appreciate that you followed our laws in becoming citizens. Ten years to get through the legal requirements can certainly try one’s patience. Thank you for seeing it through.
@RepJeffDenham San Fran Msn (aka Josh Harder) trying to take away ag water &amp; dump it in ocean. He said so 2 wks ago. Now he tells Mod Bee he opposes it. Harder was for it before he opposed it. Harder now supports attacking Hispanic women. Anti water, anti women. Stunning collapse of a campaign.
@KATYSaccitizen ACO is a leader for the Democrats! She is full of ideas &amp; is ready to implement despite what some Senator or judge has to say! The national Ds should elevate her immediately into leadership and give her a prominent national podium. She understands our problems so well! Go ACO!
@AlejandroLazo @WSJ Democrat grades are a perfect record: 	Economy. F.                              Taxes. F.                             National Security. F.         Regulatory Reform. F.           Hold Criminals Accountable. F. Major Cities. F.                               Urban Public K-12. F.
@DLoesch This woman is a true leader! We are lucky to have young people like her share their experience and wisdom. ACO is bringing the new Democrat message. It’s not fair to blame her for the failures of socialism. If she were in charge socialism would work. Go ACO!
@JamesRosenTV @brhodes @BarackObama Based on outcomes, Mr. Rhodes’ tenure is marked by failure after failure. I’m going to read the book so as to understand what not to do.
@michellemalkin Do not underestimate her.
@NBCNews @cmarinucci @NBCOUT Did Elizabeth Warren endorse her?
@RepJeffDenham San Fran Man (aka Josh Harder) has yet to say if he supports open borders or not. Is he a progressive Dem or just another politician who flip flops with polling data? He flip flopped today on water. Harder gets his campaign $/talking pts from enviro extremists who hate ag.
San Fran Man (aka Josh Harder) as predicted has flip flopped on his support of flushing ag water into ocean. Too late! He’s on record supporting SWRCB proposal to flush ag water into ocean. Harder’s just another politician who got back polling data. He’s bad news for CV ag.
@thehill Did Elizabeth Warren endorse in this race?
@Heminator @jimgeraghty Lol.
@JeffDenham @joshua_harder San Fran Man (aka Josh Harder) supports taking ag water &amp; flushing it into the ocean. Harder said it 2 wks ago. Harder is bad news for ag. San Fran Man now attacking successful women. That’s not going to work, either. Harder gets his campaign $/talking pts from extreme enviros.
@realDailyWire Two vans, two jobs, too much......charisma?
@realDailyWire Run Joe run.
@joegarofoli @joshua_harder @RepJeffDenham San Fran Man (aka Josh Harder) supports dumping ag water into the ocean. He said so 2 wks ago. Harder is bad news for Central Valley ag and jobs. Harder gets his campaign $/talking pts from extreme enviros. Harder will take away water and destroy Valley ag. Harder said so.
@DailyCaller There must have been tampering! This person is a true leader! The national Ds would be really smart to make her the face and messenger of the Party. Shes got ideas and charisma! Pelosi’s days are numbered once ACO gets to DC. Go Alexandria!
@RiegerReport Kudos to Speaker Ryan and Chairman Walden for acting decisively regarding Chris Collins.
Kudos to Speaker Ryan and Chairman Walden for acting decisively regarding Chris Collins.
@bpolitics US relationship w Turkey is keystone piece of American foreign policy. We dont have to agree but we must be respectful. Key geographic choke point.
@CNN No. I’m not doing it.
@JeffDenham @SecretaryZinke San Fran Man (aka Josh Harder) says we have too much water/need to release it into ocean. Harder said it 2 wks ago. (he’ll flip flop when he sees polling data.) Harder gets campaign $/talking points from extreme enviros. Harder will give our water away. Harder is bad news for ag.
@DailyCaller Yes. Please. After you pay your taxes.
@CrimeADay @pnjaban I’m trying to decide which avenue to take in making fun of this bit of nanny gov’t. I think I’ll go with: who gets to measure how lubricated it is? Does someone have special training for testing the lubrication? What is involved in getting the special training? I’ll stop here.
@JeremyBWhite @cmarinucci @JohnChiangCA Respectfully: have you issued the follow on rules for the tax free accounts (that President Obama signed) for people suffering from mental illness? If so, thank you. If not, why not?
@JeffDenham San Fran Man (aka Josh Harder) doesn’t care abt middle class jobs relying on water for Central Valley ag. Harder supports flushing our water into ocean. He said it 2 wks ago. (Flip flop coming.) Harder gets campaign $/talking pts from extreme enviros. Harder is bad news for ag.
@DanCALmatters Hayden succeeded.
@CrimeADay @pnjaban Fine. Have it your way.
@kenjbarnes1 He rocks.
@FedSoc @lestermunson @cohendavid JCPOA never presented to the Senate for ratification. US isn’t bound by proposed treaties that are as yet unconfirmed by the Senate. The Iranians think that’s a silly rule. Are there any existing federal officeholders or candidates who think Senate ratification is a silly rule?
@TimothySandefur Truman ordered the bombing to break Japan and save American lives. The Russians are particularly upset about the saving of American lives. Go figure.
At some point all of those concrete canyon forestry experts will have to acknowledge that making it difficult to clear undergrowth in rural areas contributes to catastrophic wildfires. Those with asthma/COPD/infants/etc are suffering from the smoke. Something has to change.
@DailyMail Lol. Obama gave him enough money to buy all 31 franchises. Mahmoud wants front row owners’ seats! He’s thinking Obama could be the Commissioner. If Rodman can be ambassador to North Korea, then anything is possible!  Remember: you heard it here first!
@scottlay @johnmyers I tweeted about the wisdom of building the tunnels. Gov Brown’s ediface complex with these tunnels is financially foolish. The tunnels are a bigger boondoggle than HSR choo choo.
@CrimeADay @pnjaban So be it: I’m never going!
@scottlay @johnmyers The tunnel tutorial is easy: $25B for an extra 400kaf/yr. $62,500/af +/-. Tax free interest paid on that is about $3000/af/yr. Not a good price for transit only. Still have to get the water. No wonder the project is struggling: no buyers at that price. Everything else is smoke.
@JeffDenham San Fran Man (aka Josh Harder) supports flushing ag water into ocean. He said so 2 wks ago. (I predict he flip flops when he sees polling data.) Harder gets his campaign $/talking points from extreme enviros. Harder is bad news for Central Valley ag.
@GideonResnick @toreyvanoot @Ocasio2018 @KanielaIng One real hurricane headed to Hawaii and one faux hurricane. Should be interesting.
@MattRexroad Can’t clear them now. State Forestry Dept has to approve any clearing. May require an EIR in case anyone sues. With protests that accompany any contract award to potentially non-union contractors, it could take years just to get to “Start”. Welcome to CA!
@brianschatz Joe Crowley. Run Joe run!
@charliekirk11 Didn’t Gov Brown go to China and agree to all sorts of unenforceable environmental agreements? Was “plastic” or “ocean dumping” in any of those unenforceable agreements? Talk about getting played.
Now somebody is talking about splitting CA into 3 time zones. My recommended zones? (1) EST aka “Elitists will tell us what we need to know” Standard Time; (2) MST aka “Morons run this state” Standard Time; (3) PST aka “People who live/work here are getting screwd” Standard Time.
@brhodes For the rest of your life, you will be known as the architect of Syrian Red Lines and Iranian cash transfers. Congratulations. In each case, your experts told you to do one thing but you were smarter than them. We will be cleaning up the damage for decades. Go away.
@CrimeADay @pnjaban Somewhere, deep within the federal bureaucracy, there sits a group of officials who compose the actual wording of these statutes. I am so grateful. I feel much safer. Not.
@Ocasio2018 I hope your D colleagues make you “the messenger” for the fall 2018 campaigns. You so clearly articulate the D message! Keep it up! America needs to hear from you.
@SenFeinstein @cmarinucci Thank you for doing this. Your effort to respect our fallen soldiers in their final resting places draws a stark contrast to the behavior of your opponent. While we don’t agree on everything, I will be voting for you this fall.
@Cameron_Gray @slone IMO this is not comprehensible except in the context of someone seeking attention.
@ahartreports @CapitolAlert @JerryBrownGov @realDonaldTrump This may be the first recorded instance of a statewide Democrat saying the word “Trump” without also saying the word (pick one) “sue”/“racist”/“illegitimate”/“collusion”/“Russia” in the same sentence. I guess that’s progress
@larryelder @shawnsteel1 @realDonaldTrump Non-citizens should be prohibited from voting in any American election.
San Fran Man (aka Josh Harder) doesnt know how important water is to Central Valley. Harder supports flushing ag water into ocean. Harder gets his campaign $/talking points from enviro extremists. No wonder he keeps dodging debates! Harder is bad news for agriculture.
@DailyCaller Darwin Award Winner International Category.
@latimes Lol. Right.
@michaeljohns @SenFeinstein Non-citizens should not be allowed to participate in American elections at any level.
@AriFleischer What level of terrorism/criminal activity on US borders does Senator Booker require before he will support protecting American citizens in the same way he supports protecting Israeli citizens?
@placergop When Bernie Sanders starts asking “How do we pay for this?”, then you know you’ve got a problem.
@JeffDenham San Fran Man (aka Josh Harder) thinks ag water should be flushed out into the ocean. He said so two weeks ago. Harder gets his campaign $/talking points from enviro extremists with no connection to Central Valley agriculture. Harder is bad news for California agriculture.
@xManuel209x @DaHogg11 @JeffDenham San Fran Man (aka Josh Harder) explicitly supports flushing Ag water into the ocean. Harder said it two weeks ago. (I predict he flip flops when he sees polling). Harder gets his campaign $/talking points from enviro extremists. Harder is bad news for Central Valley agriculture.
@latimes Good riddance to bad trash.
@xManuel209x @DaHogg11 @JeffDenham San Fran Man (aka Josh Harder) fits him perfectly. Harder wants to flush Ag water into the ocean. Harder gets his campaign $/talking points from enviro extremists living in SF. Harder is bad news for CA agriculture.
@kcranews Darwin Theory experiment.
@DaHogg11 @JeffDenham @xManuel209x San Fran Man (aka Josh Harder) has yet to explain why he supports sending ag water into the ocean. Harder said so two weeks ago. (I predict he flip flops when he sees polling data.) Water is everything in Central Valley. Harder doesn’t understand this. Harder is bad news for ag.
@AndrewHClark Goat truth: if there’s a fence, they want to be on the other side. Nothing else matters to the goat.
@thehill @pnjaban I’m curious as to whether it was a mistake. Do you have confirmation?
@Sacbiz Nasty, profit-seeking ideological descendants of Warren Buffett arbitrage geography.
@SaraEisen @michaelscherer The Panda always cheats.
@RobStutzman Meanwhile, down on the farm....When pigs fly....Sheep are easier and taste better but are less durable. Lol! I love Fridays!
@OKnox I miss the steer that was running loose through Brooklyn.
@radleybalko @ezraklein I am curious about the data from CA. I wonder about the influence on the stats due to significant changes in law in CA.
@cmarinucci @SFGate Prediction: POTUS will announce another round of tariffs in response to PRC announcement today. My view? POTUS needs to stay at this. Chinese behavior in atolls has to change. When 300m Chinese workers are unemployed and out in the streets, perhaps atolls will be abandoned.
@jimgeraghty Watch the movie “Enders Game” to get a feel for where military conflict is headed.
@HealthRanger @slone It’s stressful dealing with predators all the time.
@cmarinucci Please please please keep touting her as the messenger of the Democratic Party!
@cmarinucci FYI - job market in Sacramento area is very tight. Entry level workers are scarce. Wages are rising.
@KTVBJoe @AndrewHClark Look! There’s Billy!
@OKnox Fact: the job market in Sacramento area is very tight. Entry level workers very scarce. Wage pressure is rising.
@AndrewHClark Fire prevention crew? Don’t laugh - tested regularly and it works.
@philwillon @melmason BBQ tonight!
@charliekirk11 @DougLaMalfa Non-citizens should not be voting in American elections.
Pumpkins looking good, drip irrigation delivering water as planned. San Fran Man (aka Josh Harder) wants to flush ag water into ocean. He doesn’t get how important water is to Central Valley. Gets talking pts/campaign $ from enviro extremists. Harder is bad news for agriculture.
@CrimeADay @pnjaban That settles it: I’m only buying zoo ostriches anymore.
@jonlovett @Ocasio2018 @PodSaveAmerica Will she challenge Pelosi as leader of the Democrats in the House?
@scottlay Tough issue. It would be interesting to hear the views of Newsom and Cox on entire breadth of this issue. We’ll probably only get lip service.
@AdamProbolsky @cmarinucci @sfexaminer Watch. Learn. Repair. Repeat.
@BreitbartNews Running away from your fears?
@cmarinucci @sfexaminer Non-citizens should not be voting in any election in America.
@DanCALmatters This stinks. I hope someone sued somebody else for wrongful termination so that the facts can come out.
@RealJamesWoods Did she renounce her US citizenship? Did she apply for Portuguese citizenship? Inquiring minds want to know.
@charliekirk11 @SueCaro1 Why do Democrats from states other than CA-IL-NY protect the interests of CA-IL-NY at the expense of their own state’s interests?
I am very impressed/grateful for LeBron James’ commitment &amp; follow through on education for kids. I want to add a cautionary note re speaking abt nat’l issues beyond this school: Learn the issues beyond just the talking points. Your views have value. Don’t be Ocasio-Cortez.
@TheEconomist This is laughable. You’re going to lose the rest of your colonies.
@DailyCaller Write the bills with limitations that preclude awarding funds to cities that refuse to follow the law. BTW - how can it be unconstitutional for the Executive Branch to not spend monies that Congress has appropriated? (Careful - it’s a trick question.)
@RiceNews You only find this endangered species where you look for them. No one knows how many we started with. No one knows how many are alive today. No one knows where they live except in an aquatic habitat, and then only if you look for them. No scientific evidence of endangerment.
@nprpolitics Did he endorse Joe Crowley?
@Kate_OKeeffe @siobhanehughes The Bear always lies. The Panda always cheats. That’s the real world.
@AriFleischer Did he endorse Joe Crowley?
@rpyers @cmarinucci Keep spending your money. Ms Moore will finish second.
@johnmyers @cmarinucci @JerryBrownGov There is no “side” when communities are threatened like now with fire or flood (Oroville) or earthquake (Northridge) or hurricane (Katrina). There is only “Help” or “Don’t help”. This is a major duty of government. We all need to step forward.
@JACKOHMAN Winter cold front. Send it south to Sacramento!
@farmwater @CaWaterBoards @CalChamber @CalifWines_US @CAFarmBureau @SoCalWaterComm @JerryBrownGov @GavinNewsom @TheRealJohnHCox San Fran Man (aka Josh Harder) supports SWRCB proposal. He said so 2 wks ago. (I bet he flip flops when he sees polling data.) Harder supports flushing Ag water into ocean yet not a word abt SFPUD lack of diversion. Harder gets campaign $/talking pts from extreme enviros in SF.
@amyewalter This is Monday morning quarterbacking at its worst. Amy and Noah know better than to perpetrate this line of disclosure. Both of them are so much better than this type of thing.
@CrimeADay This shouldn’t be a federal crime. What should be a federal crime is letting some of these people who wear spandex go out in public. C’mon people - there might be small children in the vicinity.
@ABCWorldNews @pnjaban @DavidMuir Watch this. And Then tell me American kids don’t have what it takes. What a great thing!
@AndrewHClark This is the Achilles heel of the Chinese oligarchy. I hope POTUS stays at it because it will take time. When the Chinese come calling don’t take the first offer. And insist that the Nine Lines Map be acknowledged as the total baloney it is.
Just got in from irrigating pumpkins. San Fran Man (aka Josh Harder) knows so little about agriculture and water. Harder supports flushing our ag water into the ocean. He said it 2 wks ago. (I predict he flip flops when he gets polling data.) SF Man is bad news for agriculture.
@RJDonachie3 @DailyCaller I’m very supportive of reducing capital gains tax rates. This would allow capital to be more efficiently allocated by freeing up stranded gains.  Put the legislation in!
@RobbyMook @Politics1com How much did you make in the 2016 campaign?
@RobStutzman Much better baseball on NBCSports Bay Area.
@latimes Lol. This is the same flawed story used to bushwhack the voters into supporting this boondoggle. Kill it. Use the money for something we need like water storage facilities.
@EricHolder When you were the US Attorney General, how did ICE deal with children of adults who attempted to enter our country illegally?
@scottlay @joshua_harder @RepJeffDenham I’m unwilling to politicize the death of a firefighter. Just know Harder is bad news for the Central Valley.
@ABC10 Senator Sanders will have to sell one of his houses. BTW - what is status of Burlington College investigation?
@RoKhanna @Ocasio2018 Run Joe run! She’s not competent.
@BreitbartNews Run Joe run!
@business @bopinion This is very insightful. I’ve always thought capitalism and democracy do well together because each is essentially a destructive force replacing the old with the new. Can’t say the same for socialism, communism, dictatorships.
So I’m speed reading my twitter feed. I breeze by someone’s tweet calling Pelosi and Schumer “repugnant” but I read it as “pregnant”. I had to go back and read it again. I’m still laughing. I have to slow down.
@business @bopinion I’m paying more per hour across the board for every employee. That’s real life info. Where are you getting your info!
@RepJeffDenham @SecretaryZinke @USDOI San Fran Man (aka Josh Harder) supports flushing ag water into the ocean. Harder said it 2 wks ago. I predict he flip flops when he sees polling data. Flushing ag water into ocean is going to hammer Central Valley. Jobs/communities at big risk. Harder puts ag at big risk.
@NRO This woman has got it going! What a brilliant mind she has. I hope the Democrats recognize her potential and put her front and center across the country! Her observations are so revealing. Run Joe run!
@slone No no no. She’s awesome! Obviously a great leader! Her ability to string together words into incoherent sentences is unparalleled. What a great spokesperson! Run Joe run!
@rpyers Please stay on this story. Name names of operators. Where is the enforcement arm of the FEC?
@jonathanvswan I am delighted to see Ms Ocasio-Cortez speaking out. She is such a dynamic leader with a Long record of success. I hope the MSM keep putting her on TV. Run Joe run!
@CrimeADay Can I use a barge?  Where do you find this stuff? To what degree is there a federal law for every minute detail of our lives? We are going the wrong way.
@SacBeeEditBoard Legislature/Gov passed GasTax thinking voters arent watching. It’s a scam. GasTax $ not guaranteed for road/bridge repairs;funding is subject to annual appropriations. GasTax can’t be spent on new capacity. GasTax can be spent on non-roadway/non-bridge items. Scam from Day 1.
San Fran Man (aka Josh Harder) supports stealing Ag water per SWRCB policy. Terrible impact on Central Valley/makes extreme enviros from San Fran happy. Harder doesn’t get how important water is to Valley. Gets his $ and talking pts from San Fran Nan. Harder is bad news on water.
@jaggerz222 @JeffDenham @joshua_harder San Fran Man (aka Josh Harder) supports SWRCB effort to flush Ag water into ocean. This would hammer growers, small towns, small businesses in Central Valley. Harder taking his money and talking points from San Fran Nan, taking our water and throwing it away.
@jaggerz222 @JeffDenham @joshua_harder San Fran Man (aka Josh Harder) supports SWRCB decision to flush Ag water into ocean. This would devastate Central Valley agriculture. All the small towns, small businesses and employees therein would get hammered. It’s obvious San Fran Man doesn’t understand importance of water.
@HealthRanger @slone Absolutely!
@MarcosBreton Do you know what every Giant fan doesn’t love?
@CrimeADay There’s 537 suspects.
@shawnsteel1 On this matter we need to just say “Thank you” to President Trump and skip all the other stuff. Some of our boys are finally coming home today. Let’s just stand respectfully and give thanks.
@nytimes Basic pursuit of national interest: Egypt is most populous country in Middle East. Sits astride Suez Canal. Large military. Relatively pro-western ruling class keeps Muslim Brotherhood in check. This is a significant change in approach from that put forth by President Obama.
@AP I hope they used sarin.
@WestWingReport Words cannot properly convey how much I appreciate this effort to bring our boys home. Thank you POTUS for your attention to this matter.
@DaveEBrooks12 Have to get the language reviewed by AG first. Stay tuned. The item is short enough that individuals might be able to sign the petition over the web.
@JeffDenham San Fran Man (aka Josh Harder) meets with Pelosi and takes her money, supports the SWRCB attempt to take ag water from Central Valley, is mute abt SFPUD diverting Hetch Hetchy water, but has no time to vote. Why would any farmer support Harder? @CAFarmBureau @ModestoBee
@McDonalds You can’t get this at McDonalds in California. No straws allowed.
@CrimeADay @pnjaban What if you wreck a vessel unknowingly? If wrecking it knowingly is a crime, then does wrecking it unknowingly generate a reward?
@business This would be a good step. Jaw jaw is better than War War.
@CNN Run Joe run!
@TheNYevening @EWErickson Please be specific about what you hate. Is it the opportunity to live the lifestyle you live? Is it the opportunity to make money in your chosen profession? Is it the right to say whatever it is you want to say without fear of being in prison? Again, please be precise. I’ll wait.
@DailyCaller Run joe run!
@SFVYoungDems @kdeleon CA employers will be paying even more of a power premium than their competitors in other states under this proposal. I’ll be retired by then. Good luck!
@cmarinucci @JerryBrownGov @GOPLeader CA agric needs water. Gov Brown’s SWRCB just issued an order that flushes ag water into the ocean. If Governor was truly concerned abt agriculture, rather than a doing a political stunt, he’d rescind the pending order &amp; reprogram HSR choo choo $ to build water storage at Sites.
@rebeccaballhaus @WSJ @vmsalama @valentinapop Great news for ag economy. Awesome move geopolitically re Russia use of natural gas as a weapon vs Europe (especially Germany). If it pans out I’m sure all the pundits will call if an accident.
@kdeleon @JosephNSanberg Did Senator Warren endorse your candidacy? Surely you asked her. You imply that she did but didn’t say that. Inquiring minds want to know if Warren endorsed you. Did she or didn’t she?
@TedGaines @CAGOP Looks to me like the CA state funding for Sites is about $180m short of what is needed. However, in other parts of the state, HSR Choo Choo keeps sucking up all the infrastructure money. No one needs a train. Everyone needs water. “Let’s build a train!”
@RealSaavedra Run Joe Run!
@RepJeffDenham Good job @JeffDenham! This is what leadership looks like. San Fran Man (aka Josh Harder) thinks the Central Valley has too much Ag water. Harder supports flushing Ag water into the ocean. FYI SF Man: water = jobs in Central Valley; go back to San Fran. You don’t belong here.
@CrimeADay @pnjaban If somebody doesn’t immediately start enforcing this law against the reprobates who flaunt it, a significant portion of the Delta will become inaccessible. I’m going to struggle sleeping tonight knowing such scofflaws are amongst us.
Kevin Love’s new contract means he pays about $1,500,000 in state income taxes to Ohio. If he worked in California he’d pay about $4,000,000 (I know he pays based on where the game is played; this is an approximation). No wonder he didn’t come to the Kings!
@JeffDenham San Fran Man (aka Josh Harder) is mute abt spec’l treatment SFPUD gets for Hetch Hetchy water. San Fran Nan told him don’t go there, but it still looks like lipstick on a pig. Water is vital to Central Valley. Denham gets that; Harder doesn’t. A vote for Harder = less Ag water.
@BernieSanders Such as felons, gang members, illegal immigrants, etc etc. Senator Sanders is a true leader! He has an almost Zen-like quality of finding the key issues and driving changes to policy. Everyone should listen to him! Not.
@MarcosBreton Kids don’t get to pick their roots. It just is what it is. Each needs to go forward and find their own way. The biggest impediment to success is being afraid of failure. Everyone fails at something. Just pick yourself up and go at it again and again and again.

@SovernNation @cmarinucci @SFBART Was he released due to props being passed?
@kylieatwood @SecPompeo This is an appropriate move. Any info we can get to the Iranian people about the corruption in their government is a positive development.
@DanCALmatters How many net new jobs were created in CA in the most recent period? If Andy et al want to really impact job growth in a negative way, start by raising prop taxes on nonresidential property. Leases usually require the tenant to pay the prop taxes. Watch Mom/Pop operators leave.
@CrimeADay @pnjaban This reads like a 3 am infomercial. Is this really in the Federal code? Has anybody ever been prosecuted for this?
@JACKOHMAN I like your editorial cartoons. However, in this case McConnell had no authority to act; no one in the legislative branch had any authority to act. That authority rests only with the Executive Branch. What it really boils down to is Obama didn’t care or he was afraid of Putin.
@slone Run Joe Run!
It’s delusional to think that the Chinese can be “talked into” giving up their South China Sea atolls without a major confrontation. The worst thing America could do is to consider these acts a fait accompli.

@AG_Conservative @guypbenson No no no. The Ds are precisely on point. I love their leaders! I love their agenda! They should double down! The people are with them! Not.
@ggreenwald @slone Extradition to Sweden to stand trial.
San Fran Man (aka Josh Harder) is already whining about being held accountable for trying to take ag water and flush it into the ocean. San Fran Man will flip flops when he sees his polling data. Water is everything in Central Valley! @JeffDenham understands that. SF Man doesn’t.
@CalebJHull Run Joe Run!
More water is needed for Central Valley agriculture. Denham gets it. Zinke gets it. Costa gets it. Who doesn’t get it? The San Fran Man (aka Josh Harder) doesn’t get it. Harder supports flushing Ag water into the ocean. I predict he flip flops due to polling data. @JeffDenham
@AP Good riddance to bad trash!
@latimes Welcome home Soldier. Thank you for protecting our freedom. Rest In Peace.
@WSJ @BretBaier Sink them accidentally.
@AsmRodriguez52 @TheStateWorker Underperformed the S&amp;P 500 by over 200 basis point during the same period.

@MarcosBreton @SFGiants How can it be work to attend Giants games? What a great country! Go G-Men! Beat LA!
@mitchellreports Jane Harmon is a respected voice on both sides of the aisle.
@RobStutzman Denham says “Thank you!”. I served with Barney when we could disagree yet still be friendly. Barney’s view of the world does not align with the Central Valley. San Fran Man (aka Josh Harder) should run in Massachusetts, given his endorsement by Sen Warren and fmr Congr Frank.
@hooverwhalen Run Joe Run!
Allowing noncitizens to vote in any election is a nonstarter.  This isn’t what Jefferson, Adams, Madison et al had in mind. Allowing this to happen will fundamentally change the essence of American citizenship.

@jmartNYT Run Joe Run!
@jaggerz222 San Fran Man (aka Josh Harder) is supporting an effort to take ag water and flush it into the ocean. He and San Fran Nan don’t care a whit about the Central Valley. Any one in CA agriculture who supports San Fran Man should reconsider.
@jaggerz222 You said you’re a farmer. You said water is important to you. San Fran Man (aka Josh Harder) supports taking your water away. Try to focus.
International ROE:	1. The Bear lies.	2. The Panda cheats.	3. India is the future.	4. Pakistan is where it will start.	5. Jordan is an ally of ours.	6. The French are ruthless.	7. Vietnam offers opportunity.	8. Persia craves respect.	9. The Pope is a player.	10. Africa is tribal.
Those of us producing crops or raising livestock in the Central Valley need to be aware that the San Fran Man (aka Josh Harder) supports taking our water away and flushing it into the ocean. He said so last week. I predict he will flip flop on this when he sees polling numbers.
@jaggerz222 Feds have role in CA water whether we like it or not. San Fran Man (aka Josh Harder) supports flushing State water into the ocean per SWRCB. If you’re a farmer supporting San Fran Man, then you should reconsider your position: Harder supports flushing your water into the ocean
@business PRC govt is manipulating the value down. This makes China products less expensive, thereby keeping employment up, thereby keeping people out of the street.
@jaggerz222 Perhaps you &amp; the San Fran Man (aka Josh Harder) have never heard of the Central Valley Project. That’s the federal water project in California that includes Shasta, Folsom, the Aqueduct, etc. You need to demand that the San Fran Man know the issues when he gives you talking pts.
@ABC Does the name Chris Stevens mean anything to you?
@MariannaNBCNews @cmarinucci What is going on here is plain as day. Putin demands to interview McFall and when we say no he says the 12 are not going to be interviewed either. You need to think like a Bear to understand the Bear. The Bear always lies.
@latimes It would have passed. The Supremes know it. Nobody except for a very few are happy with the way things are. Leadership matters, and our state hasn’t had leadership for many years.
@KFIAM640 Ok. So put the Bay Area in with what would be called “California” and file it again. SF and LA would love it!
@mudford Run Joe Run!
@ccadelago Lol.
@newsbusters Run Joe Run!
@PRrodLA @MarcosBreton Every other senator regardless of party or state shares your view. Her departure allows virtually all of them to move up in the hierarchy. Her departure would have a disastrous impact on interests unique to California.
@MarcosBreton Your basic premise is that she can’t stop Trump so elect someone else who can’t stop Trump either. Using that logic, every single D in the US Senate from Schumer on down should leave because they haven’t been able to stop Trump either. If that’s your point, then I support it.
@realDailyWire She’s a deer in the headlights. Crowley should announce his candidacy using the third line.
@GroverNorquist If Congress can’t reform SNAP program when jobs are unfilled, like today, then that is an institutional failure. If now is not time to reform income-based govt assistance programs, then please describe the circumstances when it would be appropriate to reform such programs.
@kdeleon @realDonaldTrump When you thought no one was watching, you consistently swept under the rug all the allegations of sexual harassment in the CA State Senate. How come you talk about everything but that?
@MarcosBreton @cmarinucci I knew that the three of us could agree on something. :)
@business Duh. It’s being managed by the PRC.
@CNN The Bear always lies.

@japatrick200 Maybe it’s because 90% of the coffee is digestible whereas 90% of the news isn’t.
@rpyers @joegarofoli Golly, Sarge! Who would give that kind of money to defend a tax increase that hammers poor people?
@EWErickson What an astounding piece of foolishness. Please proceed. National Rs should put every NY federal candidate on record of supporting or opposing the lawsuit.
San Fran Man (aka Josh Harder) is going to flip flop on his support of taking water from Ag because his polling shows how devastating that is with Central Valley voters.
@RobStutzman Concur 100%.
@KQEDnews @cmarinucci How can non-citizens be involved in deciding how to spend public dollars regardless of the local initiative of 2016?
@jaggerz222 @JeffDenham San Fran Man (aka Josh Harder) takes his orders from San Fran Nan. You need look no further than the obeisance of San Fran Man to efforts to take Ag H2O away from valley farmers: San Fran Man supports taking H2O away from farmers. San Fran Man is bad news for Valley agriculture.
@APWestRegion @AP Tell us who put this measure on the ballot! Vote YES! All the dirtbags in all the other cities will flock to SF! It will be a true progressive Nirvana! Do it loud! Do it proud! Gavin set this up years ago!  Come on SF - you can do it! Not. Seriously, who put this on the ballot?

All countries spy on all other countries. All countries try to influence all other countries. We do it. They do it. It’s happening right now. It’s not going to stop.
@eean Yes.
@philwillon 65% of 44% = 2nd place, b/c independents/Republicans are not going to vote for open borders, and they aren’t going to promote the guy responsible for the CA State Capitol culture of predatory sexual harassment, and Ds in Ag areas object to the state’s effort to take water. Basic.
@LATSeema The board of directors of the political party that wants open borders, higher gas taxes, and created the predatory culture of sexual harassment in the CA State Capitol now wants Senator Feinstein replaced because she’s “too old”.  What a sad day in the party of Truman.
@ccadelago DiFi will eat his lunch. Grandmothers and grandfathers aren’t going to support a candidate that is overtly anti-senior and failed to do anything about the culture of sexual harassment in State Capitol that was preying on their granddaughters. Watch and learn.
@MarcosBreton Totally disagree with my friend Marcos. Feinstein brings a deep understanding of how the world really works. Her opponent conveniently believes age is a disqualifier and has yet to accept responsibility for the deplorable culture of sexual harassment in the CA State Senate.
@JeffDenham Josh Harder is The San Fran Man.  When he asked San Fran Nan about debating Denham she said: “Don’t do it. You will have to explain why you want to take away Ag water, why you don’t believe in borders, and why you are supporting me for Speaker.”
@EWErickson Tom Steyer is a brilliant Democratic mastermind! How dare you question his insights that no one would listen to if wasn’t spending millions of dollars! This man is a leader! Go Tom! BTW - nice jet.
@GavinNewsom @cmarinucci @realDonaldTrump In which a candidate for Governor of California enabled the drug addiction of his best friend’s wife and then for months engaged in......Well, you know. Newsom, you’re a disgrace.
@CalPERS @richardcostigan Your portfolio return was about 290 basis points below the return on S&amp;P 500 for the same period. Your portfolio would be $10 billion larger if you let all your experts go work for someone else and just bought S&amp;P 500 ETFs.
@CAFarmBureau @jasonlarrabee @AgNetWest Every Democratic congressional candidate in the ag areas of CA supports this proposal. Joshua Harder, the San Fran Man for San Fran Nan, supports this as a badge of honor. Taking ag water will devastate employment in the Valley. Especially hard on people who work in the fields.
@newsbusters @MSNBC @stengel So your motto is: “America second “. Unbelievable.
@DanaBashCNN @realDonaldTrump @HillaryClinton Read this carefully. It appears to be that Clinton’s private home-based server may have been hacked. There probably wasn’t anything Top Secret in it.
One potential China vulnerability is turmoil caused by economic contraction. USA is major importer of Chinese goods. Tariffs will reduce demand for Chinese products. There will be job losses in China. Does anyone think the ongoing decline in value of yuan is accidental?
@CrimeADay @pnjaban Every podiatrist I know appreciates the feds protecting citizens from underzealous practitioners.
@CrimeADay Does this apply to Maxine Waters?
@meganpwhite @richardcostigan @CalPERS If portfolio have been fully invested in S&amp;P 500 ETF the rate of return from July 1, 2017 through June 30, 2018 would have been 11.51%. All the experts at CalPERS could have taken the whole year off and the California taxpayer would’ve been better. Again.  Seems like a pattern.
@AriFleischer Last sentence is spot on analysis. And, it has the advantage of being true.

@stevenmaviglio @MarcosBreton @GustavoArellano Lol. I’ve shared a meal with Marcos. The Man knows food!

@OKnox Poland/Germany represent the same thorn strategically for Russia. Putting an armored division into Poland would be a good move.  Better move would be an armored division into Poland AND troops into the Baltic states. This is serious stuff. Never forget: the Bear always lies.

@xManuel209x @JeffDenham @joshua_harder No, he’s the San Fran Man taking his orders from San Fran Nan. Nobody from the Valley would support stripping away ag water but there he is doing just that. And not a peep about making SFPUC run it’s water thru the Delta before diversion. Yessiree! He’s the San Fran Man!
@JeffDenham @jasonlarrabee San Fran Man pushes San Fran Nan ideology to seize Ag water for Bay Area enviro extremists. Gives no thought to Valley jobs of Valley residents. Go home Harder! Go back to SF!
@BernieSanders Which of your three houses are you using today?
@pressenterprise @cmarinucci This is not going to end well. Watch for dramatic cuts to local and state services in order to fund pension payouts to retired public employees.
@JeffDenham @joshua_harder Harder is The San Fran Man. Massively supported by San Fran Nan. SF ideology doesn’t fit Valley needs. Harder knows nothing about agriculture. No more lies. Go home, Harder!
@iowahawkblog That’s not how it works.  Quit asking for a strict constructionist if you aren’t willing to abide by the document.
@MarcosBreton @SFGiants @RedSox $550k. I can think of at least 3 games in the last month where he was the difference. Got to love it when Boston subsidizes SF!

@bpolitics If the Islamic Republic of Iran truly believed that......oh never mind. This report is just plain stupid.
@AriFleischer @brithume NoKo a nogo on nonukes? Shocking. Ball back in POTUS lap. Hope his response is different than past responses. NoKo responds to one thing and one thing only: the exercise of power. This is the world we live in.
@RoKhanna @scottwongDC Yo Ro. SF run by Uber-liberals. Has been for years. Apparently they prefer feces and needles on the sidewalks to nice parks and law enforcement. Oh well. You be you. “It’s Trump’s fault”. “It’s Bush’s fault.” “The Tooth Fairy did it.” Whatever.
@Josh_Finestone @jharrell Lol.
@SacBeeEditBoard I respect Ms. Castillo’s dedication to giving everyone’s income to her favorite causes. She could be an influential voice for raising the number of nursing school graduates, a subject she probably knows well. All these other points are just schemes to take other people’s money.

@CrimeADay Who can authorize this behavior? What standards must be met in order to be authorized?
@MarcosBreton Lol
@DailyCaller Trump/Pence vs Avenatti/Sharpton? Lol.
@CaRicefarmer71 @EDF_CA @RD108Irrigation These snakes are so endangered that you can only find them wherever you look for them. No one can say if the population is increasing or decreasing. The status of these snakes as being endangered has never been litigated. Like I said: you only find them where you look for them.
@SacBeeEditBoard Jones is a friend of mine. So is Fitch. These issues were litigated in terms of who is best equipped to deal with them going forward. The election is over. Jones won. It would be disrespectful to now implement the Fitch platform that less than 25% of the voters supported.
@KATYSaccitizen OMG! Are you saying another country actually controls its border? Isn’t that against international law?
@CrimeADay @pnjaban I’ve always been told that CA is the land of fruits and nuts. Clearly, South Carolina has aspirations. My advice is: Don’t become like California. Nonetheless, I am delighted to see that the Superintendant is enforcing this law. Throw the book at them! I feel safer already.
@latimes Viva El Tri!
@RobStutzman This will be extremely ugly. It’s coming. Get ready.
@KCRAKathy $470k/game. (Every time he plays a game in CA he pays more in taxes to the state (over $60k) than most people make in a year.) Hard work pays off. Good for him and his family!
@JeffDenham @joshua_harder Harder can’t find time to vote in elections but needs a job. He never shows up at crunch time. If you support higher taxes, open borders, less water for agriculture and hi speed choo choo, then vote for Harder. He’s “ The Man from San Fran.”
@ABC10 Respectfully, the NRA provides training in self-defense consistent with our rights under the Second Amendment. I am sure they would welcome you to the training. At least then your statement would not be so silly. False bravado is unworthy of you.
@latimes I applaud Mexico for offering to feed and shelter those individuals who are in Mexico trying to come to the United States. This will give ICE time to properly interview and resolve each case before allowing entry into US. This is what good neighbors do. Thank you.
I’d forgotten how much fun traveling is. Sitting at SMF w/my wife and parents googling random things: planetesimal objects, Hitlers cure for cancer, Pelosi was originally a Republican, etc etc. This is more fun than Jeopardy!

Interesting to see domestic automobile manufacturers offering 1000s off MSRP at the same time POTUS talking tariffs and amended trade deals. Curious about any comments by local/State/federal electeds in traditional auto manufacturing areas.
@bpolitics Nice watch, Tom.

@SenFeinstein @cmarinucci Respectfully, the US is under no moral obligation to fund government services in Gaza. It’s amazing to me to compare the landscape on one side of the Israeli border with the landscape on the other side of the border. It’s just a line in the sand. What’s causing the difference?
@CrimeADay This one definitely makes me feel safer. I keep asking this question for each @CrimeADay: has anyone ever been prosecuted for violating these federal statutes? What was the penalty for being found guilty?
@ggreenwald @kenjbarnes1 Based on the video, this is unacceptable behavior. What is being done to ascertain what transpired here? I hope twitter world keeps tabs on this.
@TimFlannery2 Awesome!
@RiegerReport @daveweigel Yes! She is an able advocate for the D agenda of redirecting resources away from national security, of increasing taxes to fund new government services to illegals and those unwilling to work, of enabling foes like Iran and Venezuela. She’d be perfect!
@RobStutzman Same phenomenon on display over reporting on compulsory speech requirement for anti-abortion counseling clinics. That case was about the CA State Legislature attempting to compel someone to say something, not about abortion rights.
@RobStutzman That’s a good one Pajamaman.
Re Joe Crowley defeat: there’s an argument here that one of the beneficiary’s of Joe’s loss is Nancy Pelosi, given the difficulties facing the D caucus in the House.

@CrimeADay Putting chunky peanut butter into a spray can should be a federal crime. Has anyone ever been prosecuted for violating this statute? Make ‘em pay!
@reason @SenMikeLee There’s no way that Senator Lee will be rewarded with a lifetime appointment to SCOTUS after his behavior at 2016 convention.
@sacbee_news Vamos El Tri!
@RogerNiello @SacBeeEditBoard Not surprising the the Sac Bee Ivory Tower Ed Board believed that State govt can compel certain businesses to say things they don’t agree with. Using that logic, the govt could compel the Bee to just print the facts. That would be a start; perhaps readership would improve.
@Mayor_Steinberg @TheCityofSac “Everything could be solved if the voters would give us more of their money.”
@kdeleon DiFi is going to eat your lunch.
@AGBecerra @cmarinucci What is increasingly clear is that you are unprepared to lead. You support higher taxes, open borders, compelled speech and unaccountable criminals. This is not who you were during your time in Congress. You have lost your way, Xavier.
@cmarinucci @RepBarbaraLee How can someone with access to all channels of research at taxpayers expense assert that SCOTUS decision reinstates Korematsu?  Different set of facts today from the 1940s though Korematsu is clearly unlawful. Barbara knows this; she just wanted some attention. You enabled her.
63 ends. 64 begins. Wife healthy. Kids thriving. Parents good. Work to do. Bills are paid. Life is good. Bring it on. Have a great day!
Hunter Pence with the Magic Wandoo! Go G-Men!
@thehill @DougLaMalfa This case was about the ability of the government to compel someone to say something. Pretty straightforward. Becerra’s record as California’s AG remains perfect.
@joegarofoli I consider JC a friend. He served in the CA Assembly and is a successful lobbyist in California. I do not concur with any political approach that demands 100% fealty to this or that totem. I am extremely grateful that our fellow citizens in other states rejected Hillary Clinton.
@CrimeADay @pnjaban Raise your hand if you’ve been convicted of violating this penis pump penal provision.
@JerryBrownGov You signed legislation that raises gas taxes on the working poor, provides no guarantees of funding, specifically prohibits new capacity additions, and spends about thirty percent of the money on non roadway projects. You own this pig and don’t have enough lipstick. Repeal it!
@charliekirk11 @slone Until last Friday, I’d never heard of the Red Hen restaurant. My life was simpler then. Can we move on?
@DailyCaller Maxine is a real leader for Democratic values. I am delighted to have her and Nancy Pelosi as voices for the Democratic Party. Maxine’s intellectual insights are formidable. I appreciate her experience in the private sector. The Ds need young leaders like Maxine. Go Maxine!

@kenjbarnes1 @sacbee_news @Ryan_Lillis This is excellent research and very informative for interested voters. Good job!
@CrimeADay @pnjaban What is the penalty for violating this critical law? Has anyone ever been prosecuted for this crime? Apparently it’s not a crime to shoot dark geese from a car with or without both legs. I feel so much safer knowing taxpayer resources are being spent this way. Thank goodness!
@TimothySandefur What about the yteglistophulos?
@kdeleon @realDonaldTrump In anticipation of your exciting campaign over the next four and a half months, please share with us any other state or federal current criminal statutes that you believe should not result in separation of the perpetrator from other family members.
@BreitbartNews Someone actually read the bill. This proposed legislation and the reaction to it shows the difference between serious legislation and election year posturing.
@CalbuzzBlog @steveschmidt He’s still my friend. I hope the surgery goes well.
@MarcosBreton @SFGiants @SFGiantsFans Seems like the thing that happens in SF and Cleveland.
It would be helpful if someone clarified the impact of the Flores Settlement and subsequent judicial review regarding how to process adults with children attempting to illegally enter US at a location that is not a designated port of entry. Enough with the “whataboutisms”.
@CrimeADay @pnjaban I love this series of tweets. Keep them coming.
@kenjbarnes1 @realDonaldTrump @GOP Each year approximately one million immigrants are allowed into our country in accordance w/our laws. Virtually everyone welcomes this legal activity. Why do some people advocate that add’l applicants be allowed in without complying with our laws? SOL inscription is powerful.
@DailyCaller Put this interview on every possible broadcast media channel possible. Do not attempt to illegally enter the United States.
@erichogue You were playing matchmaker!
@mschlapp @pnjaban Please clarify what this means.
@marcbhanson @johnmyers @JoshNewmanCA @SenatorNewmanCA We’ll see.
After 20 years of soft on crime appointments to the California judicial bench, how many Aaron Persky clones now sit as judges in California? Do you think Gov. Gavin Newsom will appoint more or fewer Aaron Perskys to the bench? Is it time to try a different approach?
@joshtpm These soldiers need to be brought home. POTUS did the right thing in bringing this up in NoKo talks.
@TomSteyer @jasonkinney Nice plane, Tom.
@stephenfhayes The day-to-day responsibility for dealing with any attempted foreign interference in our election rests solely with the executive branch.
@CrimeADay @pnjaban Boom! There it is! I feel safer already.
@ScottGreenfield @pnjaban If former Judge Persky had taken a different approach to punishing the dirtbag who raped an unconscious woman, perhaps voters would not have recalled him. What you have shared with us sounds like bad lawyering rather than anything else.
@scottlay @SenFeinstein We retain the right to allow or deny entry to any non-citizen without regard to what citizens of other countries think. If someone tries to force their way into our house, I doubt they will be successful.
@scottlay @SenFeinstein Probably hasn’t changed since 1992 (or 1993?). It’s become the fourth rail of American politics. That’s too bad. These issues need to be addressed.
@scottlay @SenFeinstein I’m all for enforcing laws passed in regular legislative order, signed by the executive (or not vetoed), implemented by a rule-making process disclosed in the Federal Register. DiFi will eat Kevin Leon’s lunch.
@DailyCaller That’s deplorable.
@SenFeinstein @scottlay The CA US Senate race continues. If Sen. Feinstein thinks non-citizens and their children should be allowed into the US, perhaps she could introduce legislation to that effect.
@chrislhayes Pelosi, Schumer and the National Ds are currently using 2000 children separated from their parents as an excuse to not negotiate a legislative solution to a fundamentally broken national immigration system.
@Lawrence That is correct. We have one senator who takes her responsibilities very seriously while the other one thinks only about running for another office.
@JACKOHMAN I am deeply grateful for the President making a priority of the return of the remains of Korea KIA. There is nothing else to say. Shame on those who do say something else.
@pnjaban Why is Senator Newman still a Senator? He was recalled. Why won’t the Secretary of State certify the election? This is appalling. The voters wishes need to be respected.
@PPICnotes Sadly, there is no reduction in crime, even though that is the implication. The people who would have comprised the 8% are now in our neighborhoods committing petty crimes under $950 value so all they get is a citation. This is such baloney. PPIC is better than this.

@NotANuisanceCA This sets up an interesting situation re Govt s ability to enter our homes and businesses without a warrant or permission. Is this another effort to use a statute to evade constitutional restrictions?
Used to be that under Truman, JFK, LBJ the Democratic Party represented “the man who just wants to go to work.” Under today’s national Democratic leadership of Pelosi/Schumer/Sanders/Warren the Democratic Party represents “the man who just won’t go to work.”  Go figure.

@BuzzPatterson @CAbobcat I think it’s important to remember that Mr. Kerr’s father was killed while working overseas. I suspect that the loss of his father in this way has impacted his world view. I encourage you to do some research on how he died. A little understanding goes a long way.
@WWarped @CAbobcat That looks like a hoot!  What could possibly go wrong?
Hats off to Carl DeMaio for his work on recall of Josh Newman. When Republicans talk about issues that impact people’s everyday life they are able to create a winning coalition. You have to get to 50% + 1 or you’re just a 21st Century Harold Stassen.

@StevenTDennis You are incorrect. The following people were in the House at the time: Blunt, Burr, Graham, Moran, Portman, Thune, Wicker. As members of the House, they could not vote for or against impeachment; that responsibility rests with Senators only.

@rwp2011 @DailyCaller Basic difficulty for each POTUS is that every foreign ldr wants to take America down. China will not stop in South China Sea until they are bluntly confronted over their construction of islands and shipping harassment. No amount of “happy face” statements will solve this problem.
@NBCNightlyNews Very similar approach to the mandates about relative high cost kw from solar/wind/etc.   Two sides of the same coin.
@TheEconomist This is one of the Achilles heels of China. We need to exploit it. Also affects “our friends” in Russia.
@AlirezaNader Sure glad President Obama secretly sent them all that cash. Somebody should ask Ben Rhodes at MSNBC what the foundational reasoning was for giving all that cash to a state that openly supports terrorism, and then keep following up when he tries to change the subject.
@Peggynoonannyc Case in point: McClatchy Newspapers.
@redsteeze @newsbusters Ben Rhodes at MSNBC is so typical of Washington DC. However, this could be like going to court. Any commentator will now be able to question Mr. Rhodes about multiple policy failures. This will be great TV; a daily reminder about how national D leadership thinks things through.
@CNN China will not stop. What needs to happen is for USA to provide plausibly deniable security umbrella for another country to do exactly what China is doing re island building.
@KQED The state of Washington has no state income tax.
@jendlouhyhc How is this different from mandating that a certain portion of your energy supply must be solar or natural gas or hydro or whatever?
@AriFleischer From what I can see: (1) Kim elevated by this rapprochement. (2) Xi ROFLHAO. 3) In Kim’s world view, nuclear weapons program forced America to meet. 4) Other bad actors have noticed and will now follow suit. (5) This is going to end badly.

@RobStutzman Old news.
Re China reef building in shipping lanes: another country needs to do same. Then US Navy could respond to their request for emergency aid “due to an accident”. China not going to stop. We either do something or accept the new landscape. Think Crimea replay. Thank you Pres Obama.

@matt_weiser @rmazor Repeating my point about the quality of statewide Democratic elected leaders.
@brithume This is so sad.
@RaquelMinkey @natemcdermott @RiegerReport Gave billions to the Iranians. Yielded the South China Sea to China. Blinked on Assad chemical weapons. Allowed NoKo to develop nukes/ICBMs. Provided weapons to drug cartels. Deported record number of illegals. Empowered Muslim Brotherhood. You’re right - he did a lot.
@natemcdermott @RiegerReport The administrative and law enforcement responsibility of preventing any foreign interference in our elections rests with the Executive Branch. President Obama knew about the Russian efforts and did nothing. What was he thinking?
@foonrhee @realDonaldTrump USA spent last 50 years attempting to get NoKo to change behavior. Irrefutable outcome is millions of NKoreans dead and nukes on ICBMs controlled by who knows.  Old approach failed to achieve its objectives. Since you disapprove of POTUS’ new approach, please share your plan.
@matt_weiser You are making my point. Thank you.
@matt_weiser That’s inexcusable! What’s the matter with these Obama appointees? And not a peep from all the CA based Democrat office holders. Unbelievable!
@joshtpm What does the law require? How has the law been enforced in the past? Is there any discretion in how the law is enforced? Please tell the whole story.
@tedlieu @cmarinucci @realDonaldTrump Maybe you should run for Congress so you can propose legislation to change this practice.
@ColinKahl @brhodes When you try to run with the Big Dogs you should expect to be bitten. Perhaps you and Mr. Rhodes should have stayed on the porch. Mr. Rhodes tenure was a disaster. If your record matches his, you probably should just be quiet and go home.
@AriMelber @Politics1com The response from Congressman Schiff’s office regarding meeting with Julian Assange is the very first time I have agreed with Congressman Schiff on anything. I doubt that this is the beginning of a trend on my part.

@matt_weiser That’s what every advocate says. The reality is that the designation becomes a starting point from which other “good ideas” then flow. The net result is that the residents lose control over their community.
@matt_weiser That’s what every advocate says.
@FoxNews @slone @realDonaldTrump POTUS makes a good point.
@FoxNews First the chickens. Then the duck. No telling where it ends.

@stevenmaviglio @CalPERS Good morning Steve. CALPERS job is to maximize returns and minimize risk. S&amp;P 500 is recognized in investment industry as well diversified. CALPERS underperformed it. You’re OK with that, I’m not. Perhaps if CA Dems stopped trying to impose their PC agenda, returns would rise.
Facts are facts. CALPERS own report shows they underperformed diversified S&amp;P 500 by billions of dollars. That’s not OK. For taxpayers &amp; beneficiaries, results matter. Given results, it seems taxpayers &amp; beneficiaries would have been better off if mgmt had stayed home every day.
CALPERS is reporting portfolio returns of 11.2% for 7/1/16-6/30/17 and 8.8% for 7/1/12-6/40/17. S&amp;P 500 ETFs rose 13+% during 7/1/16-6/30/17 and 12+% during 7/1/12-6/30/17. Underperformance hurts taxpayers and beneficiaries. Who’s in charge? Rebuild the CA Dream.

In immigration debate Congress MUST include an agric guest worker program with stringent vetting. CA agric depends on seasonal labor supply. Getting nutrition to cities depends on seasonal labor supply. Need strong safeguards to ensure workers return home. Figure it out. Urgent!
@johnmyers @JerryBrownGov Good article. The Governor and I have significant policy differences. I appreciate those instances where he served as a check and a balance on the extreme liberal agenda ruining our state. I wish he had been more resolute more often. Vaya con Dios. Rebuild the California Dream.
@lbarronlopez @dcexaminer Duh.
LA Times reporting that original design flaws were root cause of Oroville disaster but no one is responsible. This reminds me of the design flaws in the SF Bay Bridge reconstruction involving imported structural nuts and bolts.#RebuildCADream
New policy announced by CA Legislature leaders re sexual harassment: “We will determine what you need to know and when you need to know it.” Translation: “We own this place. We set the rules. We don’t care what you think. Stop pestering us about our culture of boorish behavior.”
@WestWingReport @cspan From this painting, it appears that Washington had red hair as a young man. Another interesting piece of Americana.
@dcexaminer @slone Duh.
Filed paperwork today to run for Governor. Simply put, I’m running to Rebuild the California Dream and I’ll work with anyone to make that happen. In the coming days I’ll be sharing solutions. Watch this space for updates. Better yet, join me! Let’s do this together!
In some instances insurance companies will refuse to renew fire policies in areas burned in 2017. CA elected officials should spend time/effort to figure out a solution for affected residents. It seems they are too busy attacking Trump Admin or covering up sexual harassment.
@CapRadioNews A predictable outcome from the fires. Is it too much to ask our elected officials to address this problem? Unfortunately, it seems they are too busy attacking the Trump Administration or sweeping under the rug their boorish sexual harassment of their employees. CA is broken.
@keckery @RexHime Class act. The only thing better for Mr Oaks is to be a Giant!
Broom. Dirt. Rug. Today’s Oroville report essentially says improper design and poor management caused failure but no one at fault. My view? Resources needed to properly operate Oroville were purposefully redirected by electeds to various PC “issues dujour”. CA is broken.
@DanCALmatters The non graduation rate in some districts exceeds 50%. This level of failure is what really troubles taxpayers. It feels like we’re paying twice for an education, then you can’t return it for refund or repair because the student is now over 18.  CA is broken. Time for a change
@DanCALmatters This is such an insult to taxpayers and people who’s job is “on the bubble”.
No gas cars by 2040? Legislators are so desperate for 15 minutes of fame they’ll propose anything. They need to focus on today’s problems: failing schools, unaffordable housing, declining middle class, water supply, drug abuse epidemic, mental health failures, rampant crime, etc.
@RogerSalazar I’ve been busting my tail for 40 years to take care of my family and build my business. I’ve volunteered, served my community, coached youth soccer, helped at junior high arrivals/departures. You know nothing about me or what I do. I’ve never said this to anyone: STFU!
@johnmyers @melmason @mcgreevy99 Why does Mendoza get paid leave?
@shawnclewis @CapRadioNews So he preys on women, lived with the pro tem, gets his pay and health care and per diem while suspended. The woman who was fired gets bumpkis. Taxpayers in this district get disenfranchised. What are we witnessing? This is being swept under the rug.
@WorldAndScience No, it’s bigger.
@CapRadioNews Does he continue to receive Pay and benefits during this leave of absence?
@CapRadioNews Was there any Dem priority legislation pushed thru the Senate during those six weeks mentioned in your article? A cynic would say “Follow the money.”
@slone I’ve always thought Dennis Rodman should be ambassador to NoKo. Then he could talk trash to Rocketman. Jaw jaw is better than War War.
@gary_kelly CA Dem candidates for Governor: “Don’t worry. For those of you who live in California we will figure out a way for you to keep paying high taxes.” Attorney General Becerra: “This reduction in taxes is unconstitutional so we’ll see you in court.” CA is broken. Time for a change.
@KCRAMiller Said no one ever. “Statement by Attorney General Xavier Becerra for immediate release: This is absolutely not part of any effort by my office to circumvent the Second Amendment rights of California residents. I reject the accusation that this is anything but an oversight.” Hmmm.
CA elected Dems have a plan: (1) impose highest state income taxes ever (2) spend record tax revenues but don’t fix anything (3) repeal Prop 13 (4) sweep State Capitol sexual harassment claims under rug (5) ruin public K-12. These people have a plan. Dems own this. CA is broken.
@Rodd_SBJ @Sacbiz In a government bureaucracy how do decisions such as this get made? How many doctors were involved in this decision? I’m always skeptical when reports use the pronoun “we” instead of using the actual names of the investigators. Please stay on this story.
@FoxNews It’s being stored in the same place as the ammunition registration system. Real lesson here is that laws are being passed by people who essentially don’t care about follow-through. CA is broken. Time for a change.
@erichogue @jeffhunt “It’s medicine.”
@kenjbarnes1 1880s: g-g’father flees draft in Norway. 1917: g’father serves in WW1. 1946: dad only one of his siblings to attend/graduate college. 1977: I graduate college. 2017: my kids finish college. Education. Liberty. Responsibility. Repeat. One family. 340 million strong. God Bless USA!
@RobStutzman “You got a problem Bro? You elitists run around in fancy cars living in gated communities. It’s just weed man. I’ll be fine by tomorrow. I just need to chill Bro. Too much stress. My boss can’t fire me if I show up high. The kids on the bus will be fine.”
Policies pushed by CA Dem electeds should be examined for outcomes. Ex 7: record state tax revenues vs increased UC/CSU tuition. Ex 8: record State spending vs the highways suck. Ex 9: K-12 spending per pupil highest ever vs K-12 achievement level keeps falling. Hmmm.
Policies pushed by CA Dem electeds should be examined for outcomes. Ex 4:increased homeless assistance vs increased homelessness. Ex 5: high school grad rate under 50% vs eliminate high school exit exam. Ex 6: State Capitol culture of sexual harassment vs OMG when did that start.
@SenSanders Respectfully, sir: Which of your three houses did you spend NYE in? How’s that Burlington College investigation going? Did you really say we should be more like Venezuela? Asking for a friend who can’t find affordable housing in SF Bay Area.
The policies pushed by CA Dem electeds should be examined for outcomes. Just for starters: Ex #1 impose lots of rules on employers vs jobs go elsewhere. Ex #2 release felons from jail vs increased petty/violent crime. Ex #3 make  housing hard to build vs cost of housing. Hmmm.
What do you think of efforts by your local govt to deal with petty crime, local road maintenance and homelessness during 2018? Payments to CALPers for local govt employees retirement contributions starting to bite in terms of squeezing funds available for local services.
@CAPolitiFact @CapRadioNews @PolitiFact Read the CALMatters article. If you don’t understand what the goal should be (graduation), then you come up with all sorts of programs that don’t help solve the problem. Then you hide behind your staff from follow up q’s. If this is best of the Dem candidates, CA is in trouble.
@JaneKim Why did your fellow supervisor recently complain about having to spend all his time managing the reduction of services in order to pay the pension benefits the City/County is on the hook for? Asking for a friend who can’t find affordable housing.
@tabberg CA elected Dems know there are so many problems. After 20 years one party rule, CA Dems own them all. Their response? Always the same: Blame Republicans/raise taxes. Only thing CA Dems care about is preservation of power/sexual harassment. Sad. CA is broken. Time for a change.
@businessinsider Not in my lifetime!
@cmarinucci @sfchronicle @RepSpeier If the prospects of the Democrats to get a majority in the House of Representatives are so good, then why would a senior member like Rep. Speier choose to leave?
@ThisWeekABC Reducing arbitrary/capricious regulatory determinations based on guidance is a great place to start. Outcome after outcome has revealed that the extreme enviro activists who consistently oppose everything consistently get everything wrong. We need water! Let’s build new storage!
@NancyEMcFadden So true! You have #1 ranking in: poverty rate, homelessness, fuel prices, high school grad failure rate, job insecurity, cost of housing, traffic gridlock, food insecurity, unfunded pension liabilities, rampant drug abuse, departure of jobs, UC/CSU costs, etc. Great job! Not.
@KATYSaccitizen Under this theory of “annoy and harass” and repeated bad faith contacts, does the AG have any interest in the predatory behavior occurring at CA State Capitol?
@FlashReport @BreitbartNews Perhaps the media could systematically get every elected official on record about whether there are any sexual harassment or other taxpayer funded secret settlements they are involved with.
@TheStateWorker Hi tech is working on significant advances in mechanical intelligence and artificial intelligence. The coming job displacement will be akin to the Industrial Revolution. CA politicos need to rethink what/how K-12 education is/occurs. Leadership matters.
@CBSSacramento Prediction re marijuana: (1) increased DUIs (2) increased # of deaths/injury due to vehicular DUIs (3) increased crime rate in areas surrounding pot shops (4) increased use by kids (5) increase in tax revenues from marijuana. Conclusion: it’s all about #5.
@DanielMorain Predatory culture of sexual harassment at CA State Cap must stop. Per Paula Treat it goes back 20 years, infects highest levels of leadership. CA Dems have been in charge of all accountability. Their solution: broom, rug, secret payouts, no disclosure.Disgraceful! Same for Feds.
@alexbreitler @matt_weiser These people are guessing. We’ve spent millions for salaries and operations and they have no better understanding now than when they started. The law is the law. Dickens:”...then the law is an arse.”
@CoryCopelandH2O @matt_weiser If true, this is very important. Reinforces the idea that off stream storage facilities north and south of the Delta are superior solution financially and practically to Twin Tunnels.
A friend found work in SF. Works in hi tech. Found housing in SF. Staying in 3 bdrm/2 bath hirise condo. Pays $1500/mo for 3rd bdrm w shared kitchen/liv rm. No garage. Bdrm #2 rents for $1800/mo. Bdrm #1 rents for $2200/mo. Owner lives upstairs in penthouse. Housing in urban CA.
When Pat Brown was governor, CA was #1: economic growth, K-12 schools, middle class prosperity. With Jerry Brown as governor, CA is #1: highest poverty, highest K-12 failure rate, highest gas prices, highest housing cost, highest traffic jams. CA is broken. Time for a change.
@SpillaneCa Elected Dems control CA, have one answer for all policy problems: raise taxes. Now that you’ve registered your vehicle check your utility bill. So-called Cap and Trade is kicking in. Compare your utility bills vs last year. What you see is price of one party rule. CA is broken.
@StevenHerbert Precise.
Middle class status in CA: housing unaffordable, rampant homelessness, traffic a mess, sandwich generation issues, no meaningful job growth, costly tuition, petty crime everywhere, small biz hammered, energy prices rising, cost of living up, QUALITY OF LIFE DOWN. CA is broken.
@ccadelago Elections mean something. For 20 years the liberals have been in charge. They own: unaffordable housing, 50% failure rate in K-12, traffic nightmare everywhere, rampant homelessness, highest poverty rate in USA, highest energy cost in USA, rising petty crime, etc. CA is broken.
@FoxNews Respectfully, Miss Harf: President Obama talked about how to attack ISIS. President Trump actually has attacked ISIS. Please stop trying to defend the indefensible. There is no reason to sacrifice your credibility over this.
@ShermanSD7 When top 1% leaves, CA in big trouble. In CA top 1% of earners pay 50% of taxes equaling 10s of billions of dollars. Governor Brown and his acolytes like Newsom/Villaraigosa/Chiang have no answer for this other than to raise taxes. Look out Prop 13! CA is broken.
@RoKhanna @cmarinucci Respectfully, sir: the new tax bill was passed last week. 8 years of President Obama’s leadership generated anemic economic growth of about 2% per year. I’ll let the readers decide why the middle class job situation is so dire today.
@SharylAttkisson At that rate in a little more than seven more years he’d be out of money. Interesting irony. No doubt he’s celebrating the rise in the S&amp;P 500.
@joshfwcook Exactly right! Voc ed provides pathway to middle class lifestyle. CA leaders poohpoohed voc ed in favor of “everyone’s going to college”. This fundamental failure correlates to union hegemony over the Dem Legislature. CTA doing fine. Kids being sold out. California is broken.
@Ngongang This is awesome! Well done!
@Rendon63rd @cmarinucci CA housing mkt is completely chaos right now. Blaming the new tax law for this chaos is so disingenuous. You’re the Speaker of the Assembly. You passed the laws that created this housing unaffordability. You screwd this up and you own it. California is broken. You broke it.
@DanielMorain Took your advice. Should be on required reading list. Thanks for sharing.
@latimes Gov Brown and Dem elites pass all sorts of anti-job laws that increase operating costs for business owners. Business owners make business decision to move jobs out of state. Widgets on the store shelf now labeled “Not made in California”. Middle class gets hammered. CA is broken.
@latimes CA Democratic elected elitists own the problem of unaffordable housing. Their only response has been to continue to increase fees and regulations on new housing, which only makes the problem worse. There’s no check and balance on these elected officials. California is broken.
@latimes Is Governor Brown contemplating exercising his pardon authority to issue blanket pardons in such cases?
@scottlay Feedback always welcome. I’ll correct it. Here is my correction: “Remove the very much appreciated growth driven by high tech from the overall numbers and it is clear that the rest of CA is underperforming in terms of jobs/incomes/opportunities. Middle class is getting hammered.”
National: GDP up, ISIS on run, consumer confidence up, wages up, jobs up. CA: GDP flat, incomes flat, cost of living rising, housing unaffordable, crime rising, K-12 failing 50%, middle class leaving, state taxes all time high, UC/CSU tuition all time high, traffic a mess. Hmmm.
@FoxBusiness This speaks directly to what is taught in K-12. We generally teach what’s easy to test rather than what’s important to learn. Need much greater emphasis on personal creativity and entrepreneurship. Other countries are evolving their systems. We must, too.
@YamsTV @SalvationArmyUS Ring the bell!
@cmarinucci If legislators behave this way, elected leadership has the responsibility to hold them accountable. This predatory culture must stop. Absolute fact: Dems have been in charge of CA Legislature as this culture has developed. Dems own past investigations/past payouts/past silence.
@FrankLuntz When Schumer/Pelosi/others belittle real benefits flowing to the Middle Class due to tax law changes, they undermine their own credibility. The benefits are real at a time when Middle Class is struggling. Kudos to Congress and POTUS!
@ElkGrovePatch Kudos to Governor Brown for this adjustment.
@LATpoliticsCA Translation: Elitist CA elected officials (who don’t pay for their own gas, travel in a protective bubble, have their housing subsidized) realize that CA state taxes are now exposed for being excessive relative to what middle class pays in other states. Day of reckoning.
@latimes All CA federal officials should have voted aye on this bill. FELLOW AMERICANS need help! You need to think past your partisanship, especially those from the SF Area. How will you vote when the earthquake hits? This is geographic and partisan tribalism at its worst. Shame on you!
@cmarinucci @CALmatters Why did the federal Ds all vote against the legislation that included funding for CHIP that passed the House today? This funding is critical to the health and welfare of CHIP recipients. Shame on these people who put party over progress.
@cmarinucci @jocelynwiener Another area where California is broken. Shortage of nursing homes for demographic bubble is obvious yet leaders do nothing. Need far outstrips supply. Medicare/Medicaid reimbursement rates  -&gt; tight margins. Middle class sandwich families in crosshairs. Time to change direction.
@SonnyBunch @pnjaban Antonio Villaraigosa, per the LA Times.
@CBSSacramento Translation: “You’re not offering us a high enough franchise fee.”
@FoxBusiness Please consider not posting this info. When they see this, CA Dem leaders go nuts trying to figure out how to become number one with the highest level of state and local taxes. CA keeps losing jobs. The middle class continues to shrink. Nevada and Arizona love our CA Dem leaders.
@kdeleon @cmarinucci “California Senate Pro Tem refuses to address the unfounded liabilities at CALPERS and CalSTRS leaving future generations of Californians to pick up the tab and almost entirely to the benefit of his political allies and PAC donors.”
@AP_Politics This has all the makings of a vote of No Confidence in Pelosi.
@kdeleon Unless you and CA Senate Democrats stand up and disclose who among you are engaging in sexual harassment, the taxpayers will continue to get fleeced from settlement payouts. Maybe you should do your existing job before asking the voters to give you a new one.
@KATYSaccitizen If the CA State Senate and CA State Assembly committees investigating the claims of sexual harassment were 3 Ds and 3 Rs, then the process would be bipartisan. Unfortunately, that is not the case.
@kenjbarnes1 My 4th gr teacher (Mrs. Johnson) showed me a series of 36 history books titled “We Were There....”.  Read them all. Led to interest in US History, which led to interest in civics, which led to interest in economics, which basically brings us to today. Good teachers are pure gold.
@latimes The consequences of the fires are bad enough w/out hearing from these advocates for stripping away private property rights. People have insurance. Premiums reflect risk. These advocates need to stop using these fires as an excuse to impose their “banana” agenda on the rest of us.
When CA Democratic leaders say they will vote No on the tax bill b/c of the limitation on deductibility of mortgage interest on loans over $750k, do all those folks who’s middle class job left CA just laugh? Asking for friend who’s college grad kids can only find min wage jobs.
@AdamProbolsky I’d vote for you in 2024! :)
@katymurphy @cmarinucci @cejapower @CALSEIA @AsmSusanEggman If “at least half” must go to renters, then up to half goes to landlord. Why is CA giving tax dollars to landlords during the tightest housing market on record?
Yesterday was a milepost. Daughter #2 graduated UC Davis. What we committed to in 1992 and 1994 is done - no debt. We are very proud of our kids. They are both charting their own course. The future is always uncertain. There will be ups/downs but they are ready. Vaya con Dios!
@AnnCoulter @realDonaldTrump Do you support or oppose it?
@businessinsider That is appropriate. Lots of adverse outcomes are possible in Venezuela.
@kfbk Check out the Facebook page for Gibson Ranch. Fish condos under construction!
@kenjbarnes1 Confused about how to get breakfast.
@latimes Liberals think every problem has one solution: more taxes.  If this is successful, the present outflow of businesses from California will become a flood of departures. Middle class jobs will leave. Newsom and Villaraigosa and Chiang support this but won’t admit it.
@SueCaro1 Not surprising. The only solution Liberals know is tax, tax, tax. If Libs succeed middle class jobs will disappear as businesses depart. Newsom/Villaraigosa/Chiang support repealing Prop 13. Sad part of this is if it is successful, the Libs will be back for more in a few years.
At this time of year we are all rightfully attentive to the lessons embodied in Dickens’ A Christmas Carol. It would be helpful if our elected CA officials paid as much attention to the lessons in Dickens’ Tale of Two Cities, which offers insights about why leadership matters.
@Capitol_Weekly This is so revealing of what liberals do. First, they adopt a policy w/out thinking about consumer reaction. Then, they double down in terms of taxing the policy outcome. Finally, they run around with their hair on fire blaming someone else for their policy failures.
@christhejourno @jasonkinney @CAPolitiFact The legislation does not require that the tax revenue be appropriated for highway work. That’s the flaw. The legislation is poorly thought out and poorly constructed. There is no guarantee requiring that these funds be spent on highway work.
@RogerNiello Someone should ask each of them: “Where do jobs come from?”
@yashar @pnjaban The only voice that matters is Governor Brown’s. What is the status on: Napolitano’s slush fund? Napolitano’s interference in the audit? Seems like the problems are increasing in number. The problems won’t go away just because you ignore them.
@RogerNiello Gavin and Bernie don’t believe in the laws of supply and demand. If they are ever elected to any position of authority, they will be overwhelmed.
@KCRALuery Define “coverup”: an investigation that discloses no names, no dates, no amounts, no accountability.
California. Great climate. High taxes. Terrible traffic. Below average K-12 schools. Unaffordable housing. Declining middle class jobs. Highest fuel costs in nation. Out of control homeless. Rising petty crime. Nanny government. UC/CSU tuition soaring. Leadership matters.
@adlerben @kdeleon De Leon in a box: they were roommates and they both have a scorecard. Mendoza stonewalling b/c if de Leon sells him down the river then Mendoza starts talking dirt and destroys de Leon US Senate campaign.
@SpillaneCa Absolute power corrupts absolutely.
@CAPoliticalRev Why would you spend tax dollars to provide medical care to people who aren’t supposed to be here when you haven’t taken care of the medical needs of citizens and legal residents?
@DanielMorain @politico If your net taxable income is more than $134650 or your house is assessed at a value exceeding $800k (or both), then your federal tax liability will probably be higher under the proposed tax bill. I know a lot of CA middle class families who would take that deal.
@ChadPergram Do the math. Folks like Nancy Pelosi w/net taxable income above $135k who live in multimillion dollar houses in CA will pay more in taxes under the proposed tax bill, if nothing else changes. Voting “No” helps her financially. Again, do the math.
@davidsiders @politico Individual filing tax return has to have net taxable income of approx $134650 to pay $10k in CA state income tax. Owner of home assessed at $800k value pays CA property tax of about $10,000. I know a lot of people in CA who would jump at the chance to have either lifestyle.
@NBCNightlyNews @NBCPolitics @AlexNBCNews So he continues to be paid $170k/year, has no overhead for running his office, builds his pension, and receives matching contributions on his 401b retirement account while living large off of his campaign account. Wow.
@FoxNews @TomPerez Said no one ever: “Democrats have always opposed tax increases.”
@CapitolAlert This Newsom idea is a nonstarter. VT governor said funding of his very similar program required 11.5% payroll tax increase on businesses PLUS up to additional 9.5% on personal income. If you think parade of middle class jobs out of CA is big now, then implement this and watch.
@KCRAMax @kcranews One possible solution to the daily gridlock at Interstate 80/Highway 65 is to construct a new highway link between Highway 65 and Highway 99. The CA STIP should be amended accordingly. This project needs to be expedited. This project could be completed in 12 months. Ask CC Myers.
@KCBSNews Kudos to Sonoma County Board of Supervisors for making these rule changes. This will help folks recover. Still a long way to go but this is a really good start.
@chrislhayes I’ve always admired Barkley. First time he played vs Kings in Sacto he virtually played the Kings singlehandedly. He had no help. My mom and I attended. At the buzzer he collapsed in the middle of the court totally spent. Relentless. Unapologetic. Truly impressive.
@ShaneGoldmacher How much are tickets?
@sarahdwire @ChrisMegerian Governor Brown can be reached at the Four Seasons George Cinq in Paris 33 1 49 52 70 00.
@CATargetBook Yes. “Keep moving everyone - nothing to see here.”
LA Times is reporting that Fire Dept says Bel Air fire along 405 caused by homeless guy cooking a meal. LA Times is reporting that Governor Brown says fire was caused by global warming. This needs clarification. Paris in the fall is really nice.
Business class airfare SF - Paris -SF: $11,658.00 on Air France. One night stay at Four Seasons George Cinq in Presidential Suite: unknown. Message to the world at large while CA burns up: priceless! What would Marie Antoinette say?
Do Newsom/Villaraigosa/Chiang/deLeon/Rendon think Governor Brown should be in Paris while California is burning?
I hope Gov Brown is having a nice visit to Paris. Nice hotel! Who pays for his travel? Normally Gov Brown is accompanied by staff. Is that true here? Who’s paying for staff travel? Does staff collect salary while on road? Asking for a taxpayer who’s state is burning up.
It seems like half of California is on fire. Governor Brown is in Paris. “Is Paris burning?”
@cebryant I don’t care if the recall of Newman makes him the six million dollar man. The Ds are manipulating the political process to maintain their power. It’s the same reason nothing will come out of the hearings on sexual harassment - too many Ds would lose their seats.
@Rendon63rd As Speaker of the Assembly you must be very proud that CA is #1 in: poverty rate, high school dropout rate, housing unaffordability, traffic congestion, sexual harassment claims, fuel prices, apartment rents. Please focus more on state issues rather than federal issues. Thx.
@DRUDGE_REPORT Our governor is in Paris on a junket paid by who knows.
@KCBSNews Said someone never: “It’s not about the money.”
@allinwithchris @MSNBC Hmmmm....,Foreign powers paying American citizens to influence USG policy.
@richardcostigan Who are they?
@latimes Do not judge DR b/c he doesn’t look or act like you or me. Apparently he’s the only American that Kim will talk to. USG should talk with Rodman. I’m not a pacifist but jaw jaw is better than war war. What harm is there in trying?
@latimes Said someone somewhere: “All hell has broken loose in San Diego, LA, Ventura, Santa Barbara, Napa, Solano, Lake counties and your going on some junket to Paris?”
@SacFirePIO All of California is appreciative of your efforts. Governor Brown going to Paris.
@DanCALmatters Is Dan saying that Gov Brown and the Legislature specifically excluded large hydro from the calculation (b/c a core constituency - extreme enviros - demanded it) so, therefore, all of the improvement was caused by things GJB/Legislature say don’t count? If true, what hubris.
@Cal_OES @richardcostigan @SacFirePIO Maybe Governor Brown should postpone his trip to Paris.
@ccadelago @JerryBrownGov Who’s paying for this?
@painno @GavinNewsom @cmarinucci Only politics b’g played here is calculus of Pelosi/Schumer/Newsom. They chose not to ask for CHIP so it didn’t get added to any package. Yes they would have had to support something additional; that’s called compromise. They chose politics over policy. They failed &amp; kids suffer.
@CBSNews Where and when can I buy a ticket?
@kenjbarnes1 Sweet! Little things make a difference. If a passenger could count on that then no one would go to SFO or anywhere else. The consumer would love it! That would be a huge boost to an underutilized economic engine.
@GavinNewsom @cmarinucci Today marks day 70 since Pelosi and Schumer refused to compromise. All they had to do was offer to compromise and everyone would have benefitted. Instead, they chose to play politics. Then you pile on. After a lifetime in politics, you still don’t get it. Sad. Leadership matters.
@pnjaban These National Ds think some delegates are more equal than others. Shameful.
@CBSNews Governor - respectfully, sir, please don’t politicize these fires. Just help the families recover and rebuild.
@PFTompkins @AWeintraubNews After a winter other than in California, why would anyone live anywhere else but California? For the sake of civil debate, ignore the taxes, traffic, failing schools, record poverty, crime, unaffordable housing, lack of middle class jobs, homelessness. Other than that.
@KQED Nobody told me today is National Brownie Day. Someone will pay dearly for this. You’re all on notice.
Dear CA State AG Becerra: Please do not file another lawsuit against the federal government regarding today’s emergency declaration by President Trump regarding the fires. I’m asking on behalf of regular people who need help and are tired of political games. Sincerely, Doug Ose
@ABCWorldNews Kudos to the President and Governor Brown for moving quickly to help by issuing the emergency declarations. This situation actually fits the definition of Armageddon and calls for all hands on deck. Fire does not respect party registration.
@mattsgorman And the Democratic national leadership is way too smart to support a strong national defense, GDP growing at 3.5%, sustained low unemployment, lower taxes on the working class. That’s why the voters put them in charge.
Kudos to Gov Jerry Brown for quick declaration re Ventura/LA fires. More work ahead. Need to keep pushing on repairing Napa/Sonoma/Lake losses, too. Don’t get bogged down w/3rd party agendas. Get those neighborhoods rebuilt!
@AishaThinker @ViLyles Awesome!
@antonio4ca Sir: the only housing you’ve ever built is govt funded. You don’t have any idea of the cost impact of your rules. Your response to every problem is add more rules and costs. More of the same doesn’t solve the problem. That approach got us here. You failed. You own the failure.
@Lawrence @scottlay Sir: I know you know how conference committees work. You should wait for the conference report before opining. Unless you don’t know how a conference committee works, in which case you should wait for the conference report before opining.
@FlashReport Webster’s Dictionary (as rewritten by the Democrats): Eviscerate, verb; to relentlessly tax the public to fund pet legacy projects that benefit few.
@antonio4ca @madrid_mike Respectfully, sir: you led the Assembly. You controlled what legislation got considered &amp; what didn’t. Kids now graduating from high school/college were educated in a K-12 system you had direct oversight on. “We” didn’t fail. You did. You lowered stds and looked away. You own it.
@CHPSanFrancisco @richardcostigan Alcohol or weed?
@ccadelago @antonio4ca Many of the kids who were in grade school when AV was speaker are graduating from high school/college without the skill set to compete in today’s job market. 50% of the kids dropped out.Public K-12 system under Gov Pat Brown that taught kids skills they need has been eviscerated.
@amyewalter Something new. “If your behavior results in a taxpayer funded settlement on a claim of sexual harassment, then your salary will be reduced by an equal amount commencing immediately until fully reimbursed. The facts of the matter will be publicly disclosed “
@ccadelago When Pat Brown was Gov CA had a thriving middle class, affordable housing, great K-12, good roads/bridges, clean air, clean water, no homeless, low taxes. CA’s leaders should focus on CA issues that affect everyday life. Quit using DC as an excuse for not fixing problems here.
@redsteeze @pnjaban Respectfully, Minority Leader Pelosi: what should be done about Senator Franken?
@LaCivitaC Cheetos?
@AnnCoulter The Bear always lies. Now. Then. Always.
@madrid_mike Did any of that happen 2005-2013? Asking for a friend.
@DarrellIssa Congressman Issa is precisely on point in this case. Keep up the good work!
@RogerNiello Absolutely! Go Bears!
R.I.P. Kate Steinle. The system failed you on so many levels. The SF DA didn’t prove the case. I can’t help but wonder if that was by design. This young woman was denied justice. Shame on us.
@larryelder @ArthurCSchaper Larry: I’m with you on a lot of stuff. On this issue, I don’t care. Please drop it.
If the CA Legislature sexual harassment investigation results in the removal/resignation of another Dem member and eliminates their 2/3 supermajority, will the Dems hold a special election under the old rules or the Newman rules?
@johnmyers @JerryBrownGov @tomfriedman This is why Mendoza won’t resign or be expelled from the CA State Senate under any circumstances, regardless of any discovery in sexual harassment investigation.
@asmMelendez @sfpelosi You’re doing a great job! Rendon and Leon getting twisted up over rationale for past coverups. They own this mess. Don’t let up!
@adlerben @MrTonyMendoza Respectfully, Senator: have you requested that the Senate Rules Committee rescind the nondisclosure/nondisparagement agreement you are hiding behind?
Congress needs to fix broken immigration system. Fix two things in particular: (1) a guest worker program is needed; (2) young children who accompanied parents when they came here illegally, have abided by our laws and are culturally American need their cases resolved.
@johnmyers “...who both ultimately report to the captain of the Titanic, who responds by saying: what a lovely ice sculpture.”
Just filled my gas tank. Reminds me that there is no guarantee the new CA gas tax revenue is spent on roads - all subject to annual appropriation. What really irks is that funding for capacity increases is specifically limited to 5%. Leadership. NOT!
@johnmyers These people are not stupid. They know how to close ranks and stonewall inquiries. It is working exactly as the designers meant for it to work with exactly the outcome the designers hoped to achieve.
@scottlay Testimony was that perps’ IDs are known and nobody followed up to reveal names. No one held accountable. Sad to watch Gravert walk the plank for Dem leadership yesterday. What a legacy for her.
@HJTA Said the captain of the Titanic to concerned passengers: “Nothing to see here, folks - Keep moving.”
@ChadPergram What a concept! You’re assaulted. You tell police. They arrest perp. This approach is apparently not applicable to elected officials. Imagine what the police would do if they were told someone was running around the Capitol grounds in their underwear.
@DanielMorain BTW - kudos to the Bee for staying on this.
@DanielMorain The comment abt non-disclosure agreements vs non-disparagement agreements precisely encapsulates the public’s disgust w this behavior. Gravert knew exactly what was being asked even though the question was poorly framed. She chose power over truth. She was following instructions.
@deirdrewalshcnn @Politics1com Clever move and rhetoric.
@AriFleischer Single pane windows.
Re sexual harassment at CA State Capitol: no way the Dems expel Sen. Mendoza or any other member of their caucus b/c 26 is less than 2/3 of 40. The resultant lack of accountability sends the following message to all perps: “Go ahead. Our power is more important than these women.”
@AriFleischer Stepping on the button on the floor in the car to start the car.
@CNNPolitics Typical response by Senator Sanders. Why not just give each resident $45,000?
@mcgreevy99 If Mendoza resigns or is expelled, would the Dems lose their supermajority?
@richardcostigan At least some communities are enjoying job and income growth. Are there any homeless camps in SF?
@SpillaneCa Guy running for mayor hires his best friend to run his campaign + his best friend’s wife as a campaign aide. Candidate decides to skip a 3 hour long campaign event &amp; sends campaign manager instead. I’m stopping here. Leadership requires integrity.
@KQED These families need relief from bureaucratic impediments to rebuilding. Kudos to Dave Jones for doing what he can to expedite processing of claims. That’s step one. Next step is to expedite building permits. Is Jones the only State official with a role here?
@hipsterocracy Only one shoe?
@laurafriedman43 @1KatieOrr What is the schedule of hearings? What is the subject matter of each hearing? Who are the witnesses being called for each hearing? When are you publicly interviewing the alleged perps?
@RobStutzman Who’s playing?
@richardcostigan @elonmusk @Tesla Federal tax credits. State tax breaks. Local tax breaks. How much do these subsidies add up to on a “per car” sold basis? Why is the taxpayer subsidizing the purchase of a $50k+ car? These subsidies seem unwarranted. Let them succeed or fail on merit.
Record highs in California:	(1)state tax revenues (2)poverty level (3)gas tax (4)traffic gridlock (5)housing unaffordability (6)apartment rents (7)utility costs (8)homelessness (9)drug abuse (10)healthcare cost (11)sexual harassment claims at State Capitol. Leadership matters.
@AP_Politics Appointed as chair in June. First hearing to occur shortly. First hearing is all about process. Future hearings not yet scheduled. No mention of perps. “Keep moving folks - nothing to see here.”
By last count at least 35 US states/territories grant tax credits for movie production within their borders. To whom do these tax credits flow?
@FoxNewsOpinion If I’ve done the math correctly, each dollar of tax credits shelters over $7.00 of taxable income at the state level. If $10 million in credits are issued, that means $70 million of taxable income is sheltered. Who gets to claim these state tax credits?
@RobStutzman Financial success is built one brick at a time. Starts w/education. Requires discipline. You have to work at it. No days off. First steps? Finish high school. Don’t have kids until you’re married. Make a record what you spend $ on. Put aside $ for retirement every payday.
What is current status of getting moving to rebuild the neighborhoods in Sonoma County and Napa County that were destroyed by fire?  Insurance companies are there talking to policyholders. Is State or local government doing anything to expedite reconstruction?
@WashTimes Russia has targeted Merkel for years thru economic and domestic political intrigue. She has shown significant resolve vs Russia on energy, trade, defense. The Bear is salivating at her demise.
@JudicialWatch Did the State Department ever not approve a speech to be given by former President Clinton?
@hipEchik Neither Obama daughter deserves the hyper scrutiny they are getting. Regardless of your political persuasion, they had no voice or choice in what their parents did. Leave them alone.
2/2 speaking of CA water issues, protecting the CA Aqueduct from disaster of structural failure due to subsidence or earthquake should be a major infrastructural priority. Track record of current state leaders not good on preventative maintenance.
1/2 For the estimated cost of CA Delta Tunnels yielding an extra 400kaf, offstream storage for 2000kaf could be built north and south of the Delta. New storage far more effective for muni, ag, enviro users than tunnels especially in light of Colorado River Basin drought impacts.
@WashTimes @JM_Butcher College is useless without good  K-12 base. Need to teach our young people US History, Civics, basic economics, math, science. Education is the only sustainable path toward freedom and away from poverty.
@latimes Who’s running this asylum? UC President directs her staff to interfere with audit. Before and after copies show the changes. Gov Brown: respectfully, sir, she should be fired. To not fire her is to invite more of this type of interference in other agencies and departments.
How to end sexl harassment at CA St Cap? Governor says:1) Rules Comm has 30 days to openly resolve allegations 2) if true Gov kills all bills associated w perp 3) donors that thereafter give $ to perp - Gov kills their bills 4) change law so only perp pays - no txpayr payouts.
All CA Dem candidates for governor support split roll.  If successful in implementing that change, then economy will be affected. Landlords will pass the extra costs thru to tenants. Tenants will not be able to afford it. Stores will close. Jobs will disappear. Middle class dies.
@JerylBier @stephenfhayes @BretBaier @SpecialReport @BuzzFeedNews The statements are submitted by each congressional office. The Member of Congress doesn’t do the actual preparation of the report. Usually the chief of staff does it. Did the CoS know what was going on?
@Yamiche @jmartNYT True or false: did Congressman Conyers use his office funds to fly in female non-employees?	Please clarify: for what purpose were these female non-employees flown to Washington, DC?
@chuckwoolery @ArthurCSchaper This gets done informally within each chamber. On both sides of the aisle, leadership and senior members work to cull out unreliable members. Quiet and effective.
@CahnEmily As with Conyers: was it taxpayer money or not?
@latimes Unacceptable interference. Gov  Brown: respectfully sir, fire her or you will get more of this.
@richardcostigan @porchsactown Hot dogs for lunch! Cake at dinner! It doesn’t get much better than that!
@JohnChiangCA Respectfully, Mr. Treasurer, you don’t have to wait to combat sexual harassment. You could start today by refusing to write any more checks for settlement payouts. Of course, that would call into question your past practice of quietly issuing payouts.
Sexual harassment at CA State Capitol apparently longstanding culture. Democrats in charge disappear from press. Leading Democrat candidates for governor go mute. Chiang just keeps issuing settlement payouts. “Keep moving folks - nothing to see here.”
@FOX40 In 2014 DOE issued guidance to school districts to stop suspending students and tied fed funding to guidance. Subsequent student misbehavior then met with PC counseling by district. Unruly kids took over classrooms. Districts opted for money rather than discipline. Clear failure.
@FlashReport There is no dedicated stream of new tax revenue. The taxes go into the general fund and are subject to annual appropriations. There is no guarantee that the new money from reg fees and taxes goes to roads.
@yashar Hang in there. Every day is a gift.
@GROWelect @Esther_Valdes This is what you achieve when you stay in school, show up, apply yourself and ask “How else can I contribute?”.  Very impressive!
@ArthurSchwartz @slone Bye bye Bob.
@CillizzaCNN “I see in your office expenditure report a significant expense for air travel from your district to Washington DC and back. Was that for airfares for employees or nonemployees?”
@LANow What is the cost per unit?
@nytopinion On this issue, The Old Gray Lady is senile.
@FoxNews Did you miss the part about him using his office budget to fly women in? How is that legal?
Bocanegra must think the public is stupid. Resigning in ten months is not resigning. What a crock! Speaker Rendon: do really think the public is this stupid?
@DanCALmatters Dan - I’ll take that bet! There is no way all of the details of all off these incidents gets into the public domain. Simple reason is that the expulsions that would follow would eliminate the D supermajority in one of the houses.
@CapRadioNews So we have to pay his salary until then. And his health care insurance. And he gets to continue voting. And Rendon maintains his super majority.  Rendon must need his vote on something.
@timinatornone @ArthurCSchaper Respectfully: MrNone, are you serious? Nine dead people had their lives and future taken from them and you excuse the behavior based on this?
@DanCALmatters CA State Capitol Democrats are working up their political nerve to tax services or change Prop 13, or both. For many of our state leaders there is no amount of taxes that is too much. One party rule is disastrous.
@dmartosko Wrong. There was nothing positive about Manson. Do not conflate legitimate environmental efforts with this POS. Good riddance to bad trash.
@WashTimes @SueCaro1 Release the depositions.
@latimes Mastermind my ass. He was a thug with a gun and a knife. He butchered people. There was nothing mastermind-ish about him or his actions. Stop glorifying him. He was a POS.
@spectatorindex Good riddance to bad trash.
@tchuy03 @ArthurCSchaper @WokeFormerLib @tedlieu @GavinNewsom @KamalaHarris @SenFeinstein One straw at a time the burden on Californians has become overwhelming. Unaffordable homes. Unaffordable gas. Unaffordable rents. Unaffordable health care. Decimated middle class. 50% failure rate for HS grads. Opioids in every neighborhood. Democrats own this. Time for a change.
@HJTA Why does a public restroom cost $2 million?
@WashTimes This is interesting, to say the least. I hope the media stays on this.
Every time I read another story about boorish behavior by elected officials, I can’t help but wonder about the impact of such behavior by presidents or governors or mayors on the standards our young people are developing for their own lives. Leadership matters.
@HJTA All roads lead to the leaders. Roth won’t approve the audit in Senate b/c Pro Tem won’t approve. Muratsachi won’t approve the audit b/c Speaker won’t approve.
@CAPoliticalRev This is very irritating. The legislation only passed b/c final votes were bought w multiple earmarks. No guarantee $ will be spent new road capacity. Disproportionate impact on lower income families. This is total BS. Repeal this trash. Leadership matters.
@LATpoliticsCA Need to treat all the perps and their protective screeners the same way. This is grudging progress. Keep it up.
@LATpoliticsCA Do you think the public is stupid? You’re the chairman of the Senate Rules Committee. If you had acted appropriately you’d be a shoo in. But you didn’t. You own this culture.
@latimesfirehose @johnmyers You’re the chairman of the Rules Committee. You already knew. We are not stupid.
@LATpoliticsCA Except that you did. You know you did. You’re throwing everyone under the bus to cover up your complicity. Rules Committee is all you.
Is your area about to get “homeless” housing? Many areas doing this via federal HUD program called “Housing First”. Problem is Housing First bars locality from enforcing participant sobriety. Prediction: Housing stock is destroyed, few kick the drug habit, crime rises. Failure.
@NorthBayNews @matt_weiser What is the State of CA doing to help these areas recover? Only thing found is marketing program to get people to return to Wine Country. Good start but not enough. Need exemptions from CEQA, expedited bldg permits, relief on prop taxes due 12/10, etc. Governor needs to engage.
@DanCALmatters @CALmatters Great piece. Comparing roadway improvements that are needed &amp; not funded w high speed choo choo that isn’t needed &amp; is funded is perfect example why there needs to be a check &amp; balance on CA’s one party rule. The elites are getting a shiny new toy; the rest of us pay more taxes.
@lkeane @SueCaro1 @NSSF @GUNVOTE The policies enacted by the CA Legislature over the past few years are contributing to this type of activity. IMO, this type of tragedy will occur more frequently as a direct result of such foolish policies. There needs to be a check and balance on liberal Legislature.
@greta Please come to CA and ask the same question of the State Senate and State Assembly.
@RedState This is political elitism at its worst. Former VP lives in a bubble w/armed protection. Apparently the rest of us are on our own. The former VP didn’t answer the question.
@KQED This marketing campaign is a great idea. Getting wine tourism back to normal will help recovery. The governor needs to push the “MOVE IT!” button on helping rebuild the homes. Don’t punish these homeowners for a fire they were lucky to survive.
@kenjbarnes1 @BarleySwine Austin is not SF. No transients. No urine. No litter. No panhandling.
@AriFleischer Shelby would lose seniority. Not going to happen.
@latimes “The Governor has been in Europe making unenforceable agreements. He will look at this when he returns.”
@kcranews And then they report back to the Senate Rules Committee which is chaired by.....(wait for it)....the same people who allowed this culture to exist. This is a coverup.
@CaHSR_Scam If this legacy project had to be privately funded then I would never tweet about it.....BECAUSE IT WOULD NEVER BE BUILT. No apolitical investors would subscribe to its operating assumptions.
@DaytonPubPolicy @CaHSR_Scam That is exactly what he is doing. So far he’s batting .000
@Amy_Chance More to come. Release the names of the perps (but not the victims) and the settlement amounts paid.
@CBSSacramento This is what a coverup looks like. Who are the perps and how much did each claim settle for?
@Amy_Chance Lol. This is what a coverup looks like.
@FOX40 This is what a coverup looks like. “When the attorneys finish their investigation (in 18 months?)the public will be informed of what we have decided.” Release the names of the perps and the settlement amounts paid.Quit colluding with each other to protect your political position.
@LANow “the Governor will be home soon from Europe. He’s been very busy making unenforceable agreements.”
@LaurelRosenhall @asmMelendez This is what a coverup looks like. Release the data on settled claims: perp’s name and amount but not the victim’s name. The voters will clean this up. How can you continue to protect these people?
@kenrudin This is sad.
Who paid for Governor Brown’s trip to Europe? Was it deemed official business? Who paid for Senator de Leon’s trip to Europe? Was it deemed official business?
@LANow “Don’t bother me right now. I’m in Bonn.”
@CapitolAlert The kids who were in K-4 when he left office are now in high school. How come half of them fail to pass CA State aptitude tests?
@thehill That’s not true in California. In California the Liberals release dangerous criminals from state prison and decriminalize crimes like rape and identity theft.
@SFGate @pnjaban BART was sold as a means of moving people quickly around the Bay Area. Now it’s a sewer. HSR sold as means to move people quickly around CA. Will it become a sewer too?
@DanielMorain Leadership AWOL. Do professional staff realize they are squandering their credibility protecting these people?
@CBSSacramento Leadership AWOL. How high does the cover up go? Do the professional staff realize they are throwing away their credibility?
@cmarinucci @JerryBrownGov @POLITICOMag @davidsiders Please convene a special session of the Legislature to assist Napa and Sonoma recover from devastating fires. Sometime soon. Please.
@TonyFratto This is appalling.
@cmarinucci @davidsiders @jerry @POLITICOMag Perhaps time/effort would be better spent figuring out how to expedite the rebuilding homes &amp; neighborhoods ruined by fires last month. Napa and Sonoma could use some assistance but state leaders are traveling in Europe. Priorities are misplaced here.
@scottlay Most don’t care which party perps belong to. Most want the perps id’d and expelled. Most want no further taxpayer funded settlements. If leaders don’t act to clean house then get new leaders.
@scottlay B/c Rules Committee members and staff are the most partisan on both sides. These committees are absolutely under the iron fist of leadership. Rules Committee members come from districts where there is no doubt about election outcomes.
@DanCALmatters @mercnews Leaders in each chamber of the CA Legislature know this kind of problem arises. Dirty little secret is that this culture predates current leaders. This has been going on for years. Been swept under the rug for years. More disclosures to come.
Agriculture is huge piece of California’s economy. 100s of communities/millions of ppl rely on CVP and SWP for water. CA leaders must be very careful abt changing rules/laws affecting water rights. Just b/c you can get the votes to change water law doesn’t mean you should.
Best way to end CA State Capitol culture of sexual harassment? (1) Require each Rules Committee to issue monthly report of claims made. (2) Require each Rules Committee to issue monthly report of claims paid. (3) Perps have personal liability - no more taxpayer funded payouts.
The concept of Prison Realignment as implemented by CA Democrats is based on the flawed premise that state prisons are the same as county jails. Democrats own the carnage that is occurring in our neighborhoods due to the release of dangerous criminals.
Twin Tunnel/High Speed Rail financials expose the flaws in proposals. This was never about water or transportation. Legacies can be a terrible burden.
@MattRexroad Doesn’t Mendoza live with the CA State Senate Majority Leader? Here comes the coverup.
Toured #SitesReservoir location today. Solid infrastructural improvement: Off stream water storage for municipal, agricultural, environmental needs. Major impediment is California Fish/Wildlife stalling on permits. Governor needs to intervene.
It’s past time for a member of either Rules Committee in CA Legislature to provide an explanation of why this culture of sexual harassment is tolerated in State Capitol. Right now you’re all guilty!
@CarlFogliani I’d welcome an answer from anyone on either Rules Committee in CA Legislature. Right now all we’re getting is the okie doke from these people. Right now they are all guilty. Clean this up!
@LATpoliticsCA @asmMelendez Sexual harassment appears to be a longstanding cultural practice in CA State Capitol. Settlements kept confidential when Villaragosa was speaker. For some reason Newsom never said anything about it until recently. Chiang silently issues settlement checks. Watch the denials flow.
@johnmyers @philwillon @latimes John - this is a coverup. The coverup is about preserving power. Perps are using taxpayer funds to satisfy their needs. Disgusting!
@LATpoliticsCA How high up the Democratic leadership chain does this coverup go?
@johnmyers @cmarinucci @latimes These are the acknowledged incidents. How many victims were “persuaded” to drop claims? How much was paid out to settle these claims? How high up the leadership chain does this go? Watch the denials flow.
@AC360 Good evening Anderson. Please send your team to the CA State Capitol. There is a culture of sexual harassment there for past 20 years. Put some sunshine on these vultures.
@kcranews Put sunlight on this. Taxpayers should not have to pay for settlements.
@CapitolAlert CA legislators who do this must be held accountable. Taxpayers should not have to pay settlements. Release the perps’ names.
@johnmyers What would happen if CA taxpayers weren’t paying these settlements for sexual harassment by legislators? “Keep moving folks - nothing to see here.”
CA state senate and assembly send out unelected administrative staff to answer q’s abt institutional sexual harassment. Where are Rendon and Leon? BTW - was Senator Leon at home when his roommate was bringing home these young female employees? Tell the truth.
Roommate of CA Senate Leader is dodging accusations of sexual harassment. Senate Rules Committee is mute. All who were aware signed confidentiality agreements. Then were fired. Victim counseled to stay quiet. How much did this cost? This is appalling.
@TarynLuna @CAGOP Everyone signs confidentiality statements. Victim is counseled to not to anything “for the moment”. Senate Rules Committee investigates. Perp rooms with Senate Leader. “Keep moving folks. There’s nothing to see here.”
Did the members of the CA Assembly Rules Committee and the CA Senate Rules Committee vote on the settlement of sexual harassment claims?
@politico This is spot on. Special considerations should be extended to those foreigners (such as soldiers, interpretors and guides) who have helped advance our national interests.
@asmMelendez So....some portion of my federal taxes is going to a guy who abandoned his post.......which caused a massive search that incurred injuries and death for other soldiers. Do I have this correct? This is not a just outcome.
@OvertaxedCA As companies move elsewhere, CA leaders celebrate trading middle class jobs for minimum wage jobs. The Democrats own this.
@WSJ These guys are from California where shoplifting is ignored/not prosecuted because Democratic Legislature and Gov decriminalized it. Leadership matters.
@scottlay This is how America rises. Follow the rules. Get an education. Find a job. Buy a house. Build a career. Run for office. Work to improve things. Teach the next generation. Repeat.
Lots of deep blue Dems who have never put their name on the ballot opining abt others who may seek to change the direction CA is headed.
I want to know who predators are in CA State Capitol sexual harassment scandals. I want to know how much taxpayers paid to settle claims.
@AllenJWilson Inhouse investigation will go nowhere b/c perps remain unidentified &amp; taxpayers still pay settlement. Need disclosure &amp; personal liability.
@larryelder What is the point of this is? Whether you agreed with him or not, Ali spoke his piece peacefully. That should be respected.
@kcranews Last week I paid $2.959 per gallon. Today I paid $3.459 per gallon. Legislators have made CA #1: highest fuel taxes in the country.
@alexburnsNYT Another scheme to raise taxes on fuel and power.
@CaAlliance4Jobs Only if Legislature approps the $ b/c you failed to get guarantee that new taxes be spent on road repair. Bad strategy. Terrible tactics.
@CBSSacramento Speaking of climate change, temperatures are rising at the CA State Capitol over pervasive culture of sexual harassment. Ds own this.
@Capitol_Weekly Did the Governor know that these settlement payouts were being made?
@CNN Pure capitalism is ugly. There are so many flaws in this move. I used to drink an occasional Corona. Never again.
@pickover @Capitol_Weekly Does this mean that it is not possible to predict when an earthquake will hit? Yes or no.
Get ready for defense argument re reports of CA State Capitol sexual harassment: “These are just partisan political attacks.”
How do we know that new CA gas tax wasn’t increased b/c the Rules Committees were running out of money paying sexual harassment settlements?
How high up does the coverup of sexual harassment at the Capitol go? Who knew what when? Who authorized settlement payments?
@jterhaar Dem ldrs will sweep all of this behavior under the rug. Ds run Rules Comm. There will be no disclosure of settlements. It’s all lip service.
Ds in Sacramento own the culture of sexual harassment in Capitol. Hiding things in Rules Comm didnt work. Perps on both sides. More to come.
Ds run CA Legis since 1970 excl 1995/96. Ds own this culture of sexual harassment. Current effort by D ldrs to ID perps is just lip service.
@CaAlliance4Jobs Why is it that billions of dollars from these new taxes and fees aren’t being spent on road repair? Why is there no capacity increase?
@RoKhanna I predict Assembly/Senate investigations/exposures continue 1 by 1 until Ds have one more vote than 2/3 of total. Probably a coincidence.
@rpyers What a great idea! Not. An additional 12,000 potential sexual harassers. Naive.
@KCRAVicki @CaltransDist3 @kcranews Lots more cars than bikes in this video. New vehicle capacity is needed rather than bike capacity. Build beltway from Davis to Rio Vista.
@kcranews Can’t solve bottleneck without new capacity. Need beltway connection Davis to Rio Vista/Interstate 5. Bike path irrelevant to resolution.
@madrid_mike This is a naive idea. All this would do is increase the number of potential sexual harassers. Leadership is about quality, not quantity.
Sexual harassment culture arises under Villaragosa. For some reason Newsom says nothing. Chiang pays out settlements. No accountability.
@asmMelendez Heads up Melissa. This is a stall/diversion tactic. Speaker Rendon and CDP leaders are trying to sweep this under the rug. Total corruption.
@TravelLeisure Send this article to the folks managing CA HSR choo choo. They think you can unload 1700 people from a train in less than seven minutes.
New ga$ tax/vehicle reg fee$ go into state treasury, subject to annual appropriation by Legislature. No guarantee funds used 100% on roads.
Just read the analysis on SB 1 gas tax legislation. Didn’t realize we get to pay even higher tax rates next year “due to inflation”.
@CapRadioNews Q: What is your job? A: Maximize returns to the pension fund.
@CaHSR_Scam HSR assumes arr/dep every 6-7 minutes = 1700 people onto train and seated within 6-7 minutes. Not possible. Proponents’ analysis MAI. Scam.
Re CA State Capitol sexual harassment: watch this get swept under the rug. No wonder ppl are leaving the traditional registrations for NPP.
Per EIR CA HSR has 7 minute arr/dep schedule. Avg ridership is 1700+. How do you move 1700 people off a platform into chairs in 7 minutes?
Absolute power corrupts absolutely. Welcome to the CA State Legislature. Perps on both sides. Ds will sweep this under rug. Expel them all!
@MattRexroad Damn right!
2/2 90 million projected passengers/365 days/24 hours/6 trips each hour = 17 riders per trip. Did anyone check the math on this boondoggle?
1/2 CA HSR Authority says trains will run between SF and LA every seven minutes beginning 2030 and carry 90+ million passengers/year.
@CaAlliance4Jobs If all of the new gas tax was spent to repair our roads as it was advertised to do, then 16 projects would have been “accelerated”.
Does anyone know what the projected ridership is for California high speed choo choo train? Asking for a friend again. Can’t get an answer.
I understand that the EIR projected price one way on the high speed choo choo is $100.00.  Does anyone know what the projected ridership is?
@TimAlberta Key word re Speaker Boehner: “builder”.
Does anyone have ridership/ticket price projections for high speed choo choo train? Asking for a friend.
@matt_weiser 2/2 Sprinklers likely useless in a situation like this.
@matt_weiser 1/2 Is there adequate capacity in the existing water supply lines to fight 10 homes on fire at once? How about 100 homes? How about 500?
Years of harassment from perps on both sides. Taxpayers pay settlements. Enough. Each party needs to clean their own house. Expel them now.
@RobStutzman There should be a local ordinance against this type of fanaticism.
@ABC @MrTomScott Great example of why putting wetlands in approach/departure corridors at SMF is foolish. It’s a matter of time before catastrophe occurs.
@CarsonJFBruno California Dream then: great schools, affordable housing, low taxes, lots of jobs. California Dream now: dead. Need to fix this ASAP!
@thegarance Pursuing citizenship through regular order is respectful and appropriate. Good for each of these individuals! Welcome on board!
@scottlay @Tia_Steffen @Scott_Wiener I’ve read the bill. This new tax was “sold” as funding for road repairs. Where’s the other 50% of the money going? $3 billion/yr goes poof.
@kenjbarnes1 Drain this cesspool.
@rpyers Did I miss something? Did Gov Brown just say increasing taxes was bad? Welcome to the Republican Party, Governor!
@madrid_mike Lol.
@RobStutzman @MattRexroad Did the Giants win?
@Tia_Steffen @Scott_Wiener @scottlay Simple question: Why is only 50% of the CA fuel tax increase dedicated to road repairs?
@TaxesRita @scottlay @Scott_Wiener This is helpful. Makes it clear that funding is subject to annual appropriations. Like I said: no guarantee that 100% gets spent on Roads.
@scottlay @Scott_Wiener Thank you for the compliment and past support. The gas tax debate is far from over.
@Tallboy_The23rd @WestWingReport Courts are equal branch. You present an interesting perspective abt selectively ignoring regular order. We’ll see soon how this plays out.
Arguing CA gas taxes should rise so as to be adjusted for inflation? That’s weak. Why is only 50% of new gas tax dedicated to road repairs?
@Scott_Wiener @scottlay What did the fuel taxes we already paid get used for? Why is only 50% of these new fuel taxes being dedicated to road repairs?
@WestWingReport What about the 100s of billion$ paid to insurance cos under ACA? A federal court deemed such payments illegal. Dwarfs Teapot Dome.
@NBCNews Only if govt is using taxes already collected at the pump only on roads. Unfortunately, that doesn’t appear to be the case in California.
@Amy_Siskind @Loretta_Kalb @TomSteyer I’m sure you realize this is the first campaign ad of the 2020 presidential race.
@keckery Did the Giants win?
@kdeleon Please tell me about the increase in CA gasoline taxes and vehicle registration fees that disproportionately impact lower income families.
@kcranews Wow. That is quite a headline. Need specifics. Were they ever alone? Was USSS detail present? Was photog present? Why delete Instagram post?
@brhodes @cmarinucci I’ve heard of you. Weren’t you natl sec advisor for President Obama when the Chinese were seizing those atolls and militarizing them?

@DanielMorain I am grateful that Dana shared this.
@FoxNewsSunday @AGBecerra Think how awesome CA’s economy would be if CA state income taxes were set at the average of Oregon/Nevada/Arizona. Ppl wouldn’t be moving.

@GarrySouth @kdeleon Insightful piece.
@NBCNightlyNews This is what leadership looks like: the ability to express concern without being disagreeable. Leadership matters.
Bay Area hsg is $ky high. Ppl getting hammered seeking hsg near good jobs. Fires making problem worse. Kudos to Gov re today’s announcement.
@hooverwhalen This is a good first step. It should be expanded to include additional employers. Affordable market rate housing is critical to success.
@GovPressOffice @JerryBrownGov This is right policy. The fires are devastating. Losing this housing compounds a terrible “housing unaffordability” issue that the Dems own.
@kdeleon Taxpayers pay for your car/gas/auto upkeep/insurance/housing. I see why you think things are great. You don't live in the same world as us.
Dateline Hawaii: federal judge says govt can't ban certain travelers. Dateline Wash DC: federal judge says govt can't pay CSRs. Fascinating.
@AliceOllstein @joshtpm Dems didn't include CSRs in ACA. President Obama created them out of thin air. Pesky federal judge said that isn't allowed. Big Dem failure.
@BreitbartNews Congressman: you wrote it. You left out the necessary authorizations. You didn't correct it on the Floor. Then you voted for it. You own it.
@robbysoave When your position is so weak that it can't withstand challenge, you should reconsider your position. High volume = weak argument.
@PoliticsReid These funds would be better spent in K-12 ensuring competency in US history, civics, basic math, vocational education.
@fannyworth @slone Democrats proudly wrote the bill and left out the authorization for paying these subsidies. Trump following law as passed by Congress.
@keckery @RoseKapol @madrid_mike @RobStutzman @kenjbarnes1 @latinostrategy I will never join this nefarious group!
How could Obama expend $1 trillion on unconstitutional subsidies? Unconstitutional = illegal. Who helped him do this? Are funds recoverable?
@CaHSR_Scam To paraphrase the Wizard: "ignore the foolishness of being over budget and behind schedule. Look how shiny and pretty it will be."
@CaHSR_Scam Obviously you missed the memo that says if you don't have HSR you must be a dispicable human being. Oh woe is me. Only CA HSR can save us.
@SacBeeEditBoard Omitting authorization within ACA to pay these subsidies is a serious oversight. AG Becerra voted to do that. Fed'l judges can be so picky.
Imagine passing ACA without including authorization to pay for one of its major components. Federal judges can be so picky.
Is it true a fed'l judge ruled subsidies paid to insurance cos under ACA are illegal? Clarification appreciated. Worried about fake news.
@SacBeeEditBoard Author correctly concludes that Iran is a bad actor and that POTUS is on right track. I appreciate the Sacramento Bee sharing this.
@aldotcom This book abt social injustice &amp; how we confront it was formative for generations. Atticus Finch is iconic figure of civility and justice.
@CapitolAlert Most people don't go to college. These funds are better spent in K-12 teaching US history, civics, basic math/science, vocational training.
@thehill "...and I'm going to clean out his bank account."
@thehill This is a former President of US. He deserves respect. I'll stop here.
@MBuffington @TuckerCarlson @MichelleObama Leave the children out of your story.
@MBuffington @TuckerCarlson @MichelleObama Then leave the Obama children out of your story.
@MBuffington @TuckerCarlson @MichelleObama Leave the Obama children alone.
Huge fires. Total ruin. Need to rebuild. Leadership matters. Waive rules-Expedite permits-Assign inspectors. Homes/Schools/Parks. Move!
@CaHSR_Scam Where can I buy my ticket?
@CaHSR_Scam HSR initiative requires the 2 hour 40 minute travel time requirement be met. If travel time exceeds rqmt then law is not being followed.
@CaHSR_Scam When first leg is completed, what will it cost to go from pt A to pt B? Asking for a friend who thinks CA should buy Southwest Airlines.
Days like today w fires everywhere remind us why exchanging insults btwn Calif &amp; Wash DC is so unproductive. Debate ideas. Solve problems.
2/2Gov's/Legislature's action is terrible policy. Jeopardizes transfusions. Empowers revengeful sexual predators. This needs to be reversed.
Gov Brown signed bill re lowering criminal penalties for knowingly infecting others w HIV or knowingly donating blood if infected w HIV. 1/2
@brhodes @jasonkinney Sir: you spent eight years trying to fool the people. You succeeded far too often. Please go write a book about your legacy.
@RogerNiello I don't understand. Please use smaller words and speak more slowly.
@CNN Sir: AUS is a close, important ally and friend. In every partnership there are occasional disagreements. Thank you for your input.
@johnmyers @GOPLeader Perhaps our mutual interests would be best advanced by exchanging ideas rather than insults.
@POLITICOMag If you won that would make Susan Kennedy the most powerful person in USA. Lucky us.
@thehill I respect the right to peacefully protest. Americans have died to preserve that right. Please respect my right to be disappointed.
@bernadettea Housing First needs to introduce accountability. Impose drug testing and performance discipline. Housing First w/o accountability = failure.
@JessicaTaylor A matching sock.
@JulianAssange You should just show up in person and ask to testify.
@CapRadioNews This is so surprising. Not.
@POLITICOMag What if pigs could fly and each pig spoke multiple languages?
@DailyCaller Ask LBJ his views on NAFTA, yuan manipulation, European refugee crisis, tax policy, NKorea, domestic energy prod'n, etc. I might vote 4 LBJ
If peaceful exercise of 1A rts by pro athletes is not ok then does that mean peaceful exercise of my 1A rts is ok? Can't have it both ways.
@Florida_OG @BarnettParker @BreakingNLive Didn't respond to your first question so don't know the results.
@Florida_OG @BarnettParker @BreakingNLive Wrong question. Question should be: "Do you support the right of the player(s) to kneel during the national anthem?".
@soonergrunt @MarcosBreton I'm with Soonergrunt. Basic.
POTUS attacking economics of NFL.  Players have 1A rts. Fans have right to not watch. I bet POTUS has polling Xtabs on NFL fans/respect flag
@RogerNiello @MattRexroad Just don't let her go to USC.
@cmarinucci @BernieSanders @sacbee_news I hope he runs!
@thehill I definitely think he should run.
@MarcosBreton That was an awesome throw! Perfect one bounce! You have to appreciate that.
@RichardHaass Sir: you have far more direct experience on this than me, but for 30 yrs, conventional for pol approach has emboldened and enabled NK.
@ChrisMurphyCT @thegarance Sir: you have totally missed Mr. Moore's point. Purchasers of insurance focus on mitigating their own risks, not society's.
@matthewamiller @thegarance Fair to note that airfare from D.C. to Philly is $644 on short notice. This does not account for any security risks that must be acctd 4.
@baseballmarty @Dbacks Find another angel pagan. Attitude matters. And trade for Rhys Hoskins.
@JohnOatesGibson @SalenaZito This shld be reqd reading for all elected, aspirants and staff. Hubris is debilitating. Decisions by electeds have consequences.
@Rendon63rd Sir: You must think Californians are stupid. I recommend you visit the real world incognito. Your media team is giving you flawed info.
@ScottAdamsSays @slone No.
@CBSSF @SovernNation @UCBerkeley If the professors boycott, does that mean tuition for that period will be refunded? Asking for friend who has a kid there. Times are tough.
Does "single payer" = "nationalized health care"? Voters oppose "nationalized health care". Candidates won't say "nationalized health care".
Can someone explain what it means when Senator Sanders and others advocate for a "single payer" health system? What does that phrase mean?
@kdeleon Sir: Other than throwing cash at a problem, on this issue of affordable housing you have absolutely no idea what to do. Amazing.
@Reuters This is a positive development. China trying very hard to become dominant hegemon in Asia.
@writerfarmer @matt_weiser House passed it. Senate passed it. POTUS signed it. Other Congress's could've repealed but didn't. Nothing unjust or unreasonable about it.
@writerfarmer @matt_weiser This statutory authority was granted to the President through regular order. Prior Congress passed law &amp; previous President signed it.
@CBSSacramento Best news of the morning! Go Giants!
@CaHSR_Scam Just checked Southwest Air website. I can go from Sacramento to San Diego for $60 in 1hr 20 min. How much/long for same on proposed HSR?
@bpolitics This is so naive. Go to end of article. 2nd to last sentence. "...snap inspections on declared facilities." What abt undeclared facilities?
@thehill Unfair that people who believe in working to support themselves have to bail out those who don't.
@thehill Does this statute apply only to government procurement of property or services, or does it have a broader application to all testimony?
@BresPolitico It's allowed per Constitution but not going to happen.
@HJTA Or roads &amp; bridges. Or K-12 education. Or govt employee pensions. Or higher education slush funds. Or UC/CSU admissions policies. Or water.
@ABC @SteveWorks4You Charles Darwin never had video cameras.
@ChadPergram Interesting take by Sen. Schumer. Does he think we should continue with the same approach that brought us to this point?
Today's sale of the Houston Rockets begs the q abt the wisdom of taxpayer-funded arenas &amp; stadiums. Wow!
@BarackObama @Loretta_Kalb Sir: you were unwilling to do DACA thru reg order. You offered false hope &amp; knew it. This lack of understanding of US Const disappointing.
POTUS move re DACA puts DC pols in a box: work together to fix this within 6 months (or hang separately thereafter?) Brilliant. 3/4/18.
@RepSpeier @Loretta_Kalb POTUS to Congress re DACA: "You have six months - put up or shut up." This is fascinating on so many levels.
@CBSNews I love BHO. Urbane,erudite, visionary. Quick w/a quip. What was it he said in 2013?Hmmm. Oh yeah, I remember. "Elections have consequences."
@DailyCaller Helpful legal briefing. Still confused why Payne didn't draw the blood, since he's a phlebotomist. Was Wubbels actively interfering?
@bkerogers @mindyfinn it's like POTUS w/no statutory authority to do so letting families come here. And telling all those who came by the rules: "Sue me."
DJT forces Congress to use reg order to pass immigr legislatn. Biggest hurdle is how to prevent new wave of illegals coming here afterwards.
@Cody_Bellinger @FlashReport I will NEVER root for the Dodgers....but you have to admit they've had a great season. Go Giants! 2018!
@RyanAFournier @CookieOcean Please keep saying this. Say it louder. Use a megaphone. Do a duet w Maxine. Don't let people brush this aside.
@thehill Sir: I don't know what steps were taken during your tenure. From where I sit, imprecision over the past many years is what got us here.
@business @mihirssharma @BV Do these same problems exist in China?
@danpfeiffer @jasonkinney This a direct consequence of a president taking unilateral action w/out statutory authority. Arrogance+Hubris+poor analytic skills=disaster.
@PrisonPlanet @SteveWorks4You Who is funding these activities?
@ABC @ThisWeekABC Stiletto shoes are not what I'm concerned about.
@CBSNews Was the blood ever drawn? If so, by whom? Was that person arrested? A little follow up please.
@dmartosko @SueCaro1 What is the legislative authority by which the Secretary of DHS unilaterally creates a new avenue for immigration?
@nikkihaley @SueCaro1 Wake up.
@EnvCalifornia @kdeleon @BillWalton Dollar Bill unaffected by rise in cost of power. Compare that to workers in CA manuf'g. Increased power costs means growth goes elsewhere.
@capoliticalnews Steve-not worthy of you. VP did not "recall" GJB to Russia for "consultations". We have contrasts w Ds. Let's use them. HSR.Roads.Gas tax.
POTUS has authority but US pardon for Assange is bad idea. Many will decline to support leniency after his treasonous acts. Accused rapist.
@CraigSilverman @BuzzFeedBen Nobody is this stupid on easily checked assertions. You're being played.
Someone should examine the legislative authority granted to POTUS to create DACA prgm. I'm unclear if this was unilateral or regular order.
@kdeleon If cost of power isn't a factor, then this is certainly a great move. When power costs more in CA than elsewhere growth goes there not here.
@KamalaHarris Bernie Madoff.
@ChrisMegerian The key metric is how much this power will cost in CA compared to elsewhere. Energy costs are critical to CA businesses and for CA jobs.
@FormerlyFormer @SalenaZito This is awesome!
@thehill Congrats to Pelosi/Waxman for this huge transfer of wealth from the rest of the country's taxpayers to uninsured residents of California.
@kdeleon Show us the actual language of the bond. We want to see if there are any taxpayer funded zingers that are imbedded in the language.
@MrTomScott @KQED @KQEDnews Has anyone seen the actual language of this proposal? What sort of mandates are hidden in the $4billion? Should be fun reading.
@FoxNews Enough. Shoot to kill.
@ChadPergram Respectfully, sir, you've been there how long? We find ourselves in an untenable spot. What is your strategy? More of same? That has failed.
@KQED @KQEDnews I can hardly wait to see the latest "great idea" from our CA elected ldrs about dealing w housing affordability. I bet the bond has zingers.
@gatewaypundit @slone He's now enshrined in Darwin's Internet Hall of Stupid.
It's fascinating to listen to California's elected leaders who have been in office for years complain about the high cost of housing.
@kdeleon @Rendon63rd Have you ever built a house? Do you have direct experience with the level of bureaucracy that interferes with development &amp; construction?
@DailyCaller Some call it UC Berkeley. Some call it Cal. You're the only one that calls it Berkeley College. Passing this on for a friend :).
If US &amp; allies do nothing about NKorean missile launch over Japan, what happens next? This is a Red Line, spoken or not. Trouble coming.
@organic2016 @shawnsteel1 @ThomasWictor This exemplifies power of socl media. UNR kid does stupid and gets exposed. This person does stupid and gets exposed....and justice for all.
@tabberg A huge transfer of wealth from citizens living in other states to CA residents. Pelosi/Waxman tricked their D colleagues into doing this.
@FoxNewsInsider Should Clinton Library be torn down b/c he established Robert E. Lee state holiday as Arkansas governor?
@MrTomScott No way!!! Drinks on you!!!!
@JesseKellyDC @erickbrockway I concur w/Mr. Kelly. Respectfully, Mr. Rhodes, you shouldn't talk about red lines either. Or how to deal with the Iranians. Or N. Koreans.
@daniel_wetter I'm at work.
@daveweigel Planning ahead. 2032?
@reportermatt @USATODAY Thank you.
@reportermatt @USATODAY Is that an active or decommissioned  aircraft carrier in the background?
@KQED If premise is Sanders prmry vtrs going to Trump is why Trump won, I wonder how long before those vtrs character is impugned by D ldrs/MSM.
@BuckSexton The office is just a building. It's the admissions officers that discriminate. Publish names of the admissions officers &amp; the real criteria.
@KellyannePolls @RedAlert So is she. Very rich. No, that isn't adequate. She is extremely wealthy.
@SenKamalaHarris How come you didn't say this about: Puerto Rican terrorists who killed NY police or Marc Rich (Clinton)? Drug dealers &amp; traitors (Obama)?
@RealClearNews You wouldn't tell your husband to grow up. You didn't tell your opponent to back up. The voters decided you wouldn't stand up for them.
@richardmskinner @kkondik Those who advocate complete removal will ask what's the difference between public property vs museums and historical sites.
@DailySignal Rt or wrong, CKap isn't getting any credit for expressing his views peacefully. It's sad how some engage in violence to support CK 1A rts.
@USATODAY Whether you liked or disliked her father, she had no voice in the matter. Leave her alone.
@FoxNews @josephweber19 @foxnewspolitics The team of Pelosi/Schubert/Perez are awesome! These are leaders of the first caliber. I hope they bring Maxine Waters into leadership soon.
@brhodes Sir: respectfully, I think we found something to agree upon.
POTUS altering FP in eastern MidEast by calling out India/Pakistan. Under DJT it seems US will no longer bear 100% burden/turn blind eye.
@MarcosBreton Concur. Irony: you exposed the dirty li'l secret everyone knows, then the BoS moves to cure, then B  editorial board blasts BoS. Go figure.
@FoxNewsInsider Dear Gov. Dean: please keep saying this. Say it loudly! Shout it out wherever you go! Be the leader we know you to be! You can do this!
@alannarizzo @jeremyart @SFGiants Ruining my week. And it's only Sunday. I will still NEVER EVER root for the dodgers.
@KarlRove Take a hike buddy! MP on my bucket list. Have a good trip.
@WSJPolitics CEOs public cos are legally oblig8d to max profits. Some use 90 day pov, others have longer time frame. It's about the pay package each has.
@FaceTheNation Can't be Pocahontas. Honorees must be deceased and since she's still in the Senate.......
@ShaunKing @Loretta_Kalb If true, Why haven't any arrests been made? If the authorities don't act then these dogs will be empowered and we will have more of this.
@texashabanero @klummer2009 Why do they wear masks?

@WSJ Been occurring for years as PRC demands milk. Hood &amp; mouth rampant in PRC. Entire herds of hi-qual NZ dairy purchased &amp; shipped to PRC.

@FoxNews @FoxNewsInsider @Schwarzenegger DOB: 7/30/47. How is it that he knew the original Nazis?
@ChadPergram It is the job of the minority party to challenge the actions of the majority party. That is one of the checks the Founders put into system.
@SteveWorks4You Interesting observation.
@businessinsider Cal grad.
@washingtonpost Will that be the fifth year anniversary of people not watching anymore? Asking for a friend who doesn't kneed anything.
@NBCNightlyNews This will be disappointing to some but: California doesn't get to tell other states who's statue they can put in the Capitol.
@DRUDGE_REPORT I continue to advocate that Maxine Waters should replace Nancy Pelosi. Maxine is a true leader! I hope she continues to speak up forcefully!
@Evan_Rosenfeld @toreyvanoot Should A&amp;H Commission properly be a federal, state or local body? These departures provide opportunity to debate this question.
@McClatchyDC Senator Harris is a dilemma for Senator Warren. And vice versa. Will be interesting to watch this matchup.
@Philip_Elliott Please don't confuse the Budget Resolution with annual appropriations bills.
@KyleTrygstad I'm open to it. Need to know his views on: carbon tax, GMO, drug cartels, border security, infrastructure, China atoll construction, etc.
Kim doesn't care what media call his change of plans. N Koreans only access to news is govt spoon. Can't project impact based on US norms.
Hate &amp; violence such a waste. Exercise 1A peacefully &amp; I will respect it. Espousing hate and perpetrating violence undermines our country.
@johntabin Pres Obama knew it was going on &amp; opted for his "legacy" project rather than protect our voting system. Made side deals too. Real Q: Why?
@ChadPergram Wrong. Premiums are rising regardless of POTUS action. If you'd read the bill you would have known this likelihood. You own it, Nancy.
@DailyCaller Please read the sign again. Your point is valid but the sign describes a time period. My q is: who directed/controlled making the sign?
@FoxNews @FoxNewsInsider @NFL Agree or not, you must respect these players exercising their 1A rights. At some point you have to decide what you will tolerate. Fans next.
Next on the post-Obama Clean Up List: Iran. Note the striking similarities betwn Chamberlain/Munich and Obama/Lausanne. Will result be same?
@DailyCaller Do you really believe this? Who's your source? Have inspections started? This is hogwash. Real Q: is Neville Chamberlain still alive?
Rhys Hoskins lit it up tonight! Keep going young man! Ride that tiger! Awesome!
@Kredo0 @jaketapper How does this surprise anyone? A direct result of Pres Obama sending Iran billions of $. Sold us out for "legacy". This is going to be ugly.
@CNNPolitics Chapter 1, page 1: Drones are the future of military conflict.
Watching The Martian tonight. Again. Science. Exploration. Faith. Achievement. Resilience. Great movie. Never give up. Never. Ever.
@kylegriffin1 @Loretta_Kalb Yes it did.
@hornetsports @sacstate @RhysHoskins22 Post a video!!!!!!
@Lrihendry @CookieOcean Is this an accurate quote?
@KQED What if SCOTUS affirms POTUS right to withhold? Typical govt approach when sued: settle. Trump won't settle. Someone's going to look stupid.
@johnmyers @JoshNewmanCA Notwithstanding some reports among the popular media, our institutions remain strong and vibrant. Celebrate the wisdom of the Founders.
Many incumbents are vulnerable to primary challenges. Voters are tired of do nothing politicians. Watching CA CD7 with particular interest.
Football = entertainment. Let players play, or not. Let fans choose to watch, or not. Let advertisers pay, or not. In time it self-corrects.
@ThisWeekABC @brhodes Sir: I survived your tenure. Listening to you opine about current events only reminds me of your past efforts, so I changed the channel.
@EricHolder @MarcosBreton This is an accurate and fair observation.
@daveweigel A woman running for President can fund her lifestyle by claiming an ethnic background and then she refuses to respond to questions about it.
@business @MrTomScott This is the essence of successful politics.
@brhodes Sir: respectfully, what's so hard about asking the world to ignore the words of POTUS? That's what happened 2012-2017.
@DavidJollyFL Memo for Congressman Jolly: basic concept in business is put your adversary under pressure from multiple fronts to force their hand.
@DailyCaller That would mean China engaged in 2 military confrontations: 1 in the southwest vs India, 1 in the northeast vs US. Bad strategery.
@dcexaminer There was no strategy. It was all ambivalence, hubris and arrogance.
@carrieksada @Wagsfam2 Carrie: in Sen. Harris's world it's ok to not be able to grow it but it's not ok to be unable to harvest it. Where water flows people work.
@DRUDGE_REPORT @slone Please continue to speak up. You are a really fabulous leader.
@GlennThrush HRC would have continued the pattern of the past 40 years, which is what created this problem. Asserting otherwise is hubris run amok.
@USATODAY Nobody in Iran or Venezuela is watching.
@foxnation Congresswoman Waters is a senior member of Congress. She would be Chairwoman of Financial Services if Ds held majority. Think about that.
@brhodes @CahnEmily Sir: if your response is designed to deflect critical review of the Iran deal, you have failed. The Iran deal &amp; secret side deals are yours.
@SecretaryPerry @WhiteHouse This has huge geopolitical implications. Gives Europe alternate nat gas source from Russia/N Africa. Excellent policy over multiple admins.
For decades &amp; multiple admins, NK has sought nuke wpns. US policy: engage diplomatically. Big fail. SRice admits it. Time for Plan B. Ugly.
@KamalaHarris How about we ban nuclear assault weapons in N Korea? It's long past time the Senate admit failure in containing NK threat and try new path.
Susan Rice saying accept NoKo as nuclear pwr. Was that goal from 2009? Is that why the Obama for pol was kept secret? You are so clever.
@BreitbartNews Was that your plan?  You signed off on this? Why didn't you tell us when you made this decision? THIS IS AT LEAST LUNACY IF NOT TREASON.
@thehill For yrs US tried to deal w NK. Our approach let NK develop ICBMs/nukes. POTUS ups ante w new rhetoric. Architects of old approach object.
@TheDLCC @kdeleon I hope the Senator's advice is correct. Of course if he's wrong then the taxpayer makes up the difference. No financial risk for him.
If it were possible to serve a 3rd term, how do you think former President Obama would be dealing with North Korea? Darn, it's not possible.
@brhodes Sir: respectfully, I appreciate your understanding about empty threats. I'm not clear how much you understand about staring down bad actors.
@kcranews Bacon for lunch!
@undisputed @criscarter80 Perhaps true but I choose what I watch &amp; what I spend $ on. CK is awesome athlete but that doesn't mean I kneed to watch or buy tickets.
@CBSNews When is the time to push N Korea? This is the same inane analysis that has put us here &amp; guarantees that other bad actors will follow path
@mitchzak @richardcostigan @emmalcostigan @BrunoMars This is a must do!
@jimgeraghty Great pic. Nice shirt. I know my rights, too. I have the right to watch what I want and spend my money where I choose. You have the same.
Where is the research on whether Mayor Rahm voted in the House to make compliance with federal law mandatory in order to get federal grants?
@thehill US law requires compliance to receive grants. I bet the Mayor voted for this while in House. Trump the candidate said he would enforce law.
@GarrySouth At the federal level, I'm delighted by how the national Ds are advocating to be more like CA. This assures their continuing minority status.
@WashTimes The mortality rate from accidents will increase. This policy of less steel and more plastics &amp; composites is driven by CAFE standards.
@DailyCaller If President Trump had said this instead of Senator Feinstein, how would the media report it?
@JackPosobiec @ArthurCSchaper Please do this. She is so erudite. I wish she would speak more about her experiences and vision for America.
@allahpundit I have great respect for Vice President Gore. But, according to the law as decided by SCOTUS, Vice President Gore is not correct.
@RealSaavedra @CookieOcean I am no fan of the Clinton's. I don't believe the number. What is your source?
@thehill Who is this person? What is her background? What is her record of accomplishment? I can't hear her. Please ask her to speak more loudly.
@DailyCaller RS the best. CK awesome athlete. USA greatest beauty: free choice. I choose what to watch on TV/where to spend my $. I don't kneed much.
@FoxBusiness Public lands to be closed to the public. Camel. Nose. Tent.
@undisputed @Kaepernick7 @ShannonSharpe @raylewis Saw CK debut vs Jets. Wow!Saw CK kneel during anthem. Major fumble. I choose what I watch/how I spend my money. I'm voting w my eyes/$.
@StuPolitics OK kids - let's play a game. Clap if you agree: "Lots of people in DC depend on Govt payments and struggle to construct complete sentences."
@AriFleischer Concur. The Bear always lies.
@Alex_Roarty @mattsgorman I absolutely support Nancy Pelosi as the Minority Leader and public face of national Democratic leadership. She's doing a great job!
@kdeleon Who's paying for your trip? Asking for a friend.
@wmarone "Toe the line"is virtually verbatim what some in the Democratic coalition are demanding. Like I said: please continue along this path.
@thehill Overwhelming majority of Californians oppose new gas tax. Dems did it anyway. Go figure.
@SRuhle @joegarofoli @VP Does the 20% include the beneficiaries of pension plans?
@joshgerstein @CahnEmily Natural hook in their swing.
@wmarone Maduro demanding allegiance to his administration and using force to obtain compliance.
Re natl Ds demanding candidates adhere to Party's platform positions: isn't working in Venezuela, won't work here. Please keep it up.
@WestWingReport @realDonaldTrump Very interesting comparison.
@SaraCarterDC @SueCaro1 Is that some sort of red line alert?
@kdeleon Their roads look better than ours.
@PublicCEO And number of homeless. And number of people on govt assistance. And highest crime rate. And lowest HS grad rate. And the NL West.
@EllenOTauscher @jmartNYT This is very good advice. No wonder we couldn't beat her. Hi Ellen. Hope all is well.
@kdeleon How do their roads compare to ours?
I love Giants vs Dodgers. Baseball at its best. Great game going now. Go Giants! Beat LA!
With their eye on D.C. aspirations, our elected leaders in Sacto pretend they can go it alone. This hurts CA &amp; needs to stop. Fix the roads!
@CBSNews Good riddance to bad trash. Erase all evidence that this POS ever existed.
@AriFleischer Last line of article, regardless of where you work or what you do, says it all!
@AdamSchiffCA There it is. Congressman Schiff admits what his histrionics are all about. "Just send me money."
@Uncle_Jimbo The q to be asked: which M.C.s who hired this guy had access to classified material? Pakis did collection here/collation offshore. Thx DWS!
@MarcosBreton Publish the bicyclist's name. If what he did isn't a crime, then what's the crime in publishing his name? Just tell your readers the facts.
If US domestic politics is in turmoil, bad actors around world are emboldened. Iranian action today first of many. Venezuela next up?
@LucasFoxNews This is just the beginning. The rest of the world sees US domestic political turmoil as an opportunity to advance their own interests.
@DailyCaller Where's Monty Hall when you need him?
@DailyCaller So nothing's changed from last year. Or the year before. Or the year before that. Except that President Obama gave them $150B to continue.
I wonder who would be POTUS in 2009/today had HRC held Bill accountable many yrs ago. Funny how things play out over the yrs. Choices made.
@Vol_Law79 @shawnsteel1 Old political saying: "If he was half as smart as he thinks he is, he'd be twice as smart as he really is." Played. Whipped. Put away wet.
@WashTimes Try again. Iran deal is impossible to enforce. Initiated by the naive. Negotiated by a fool. "Legacy" project that endangers all of us.
The coming institutn'l clash between Congress/POTUS/Crts will show the genius of the Founders. Fndrs were terrified of imperial Presidency.
@AriFleischer Excellent observation. Similar to: "...adults cleaning it up after the children left a mess."
The noise abt any POTUS pardoning himself is interesting. If POTUS did that Congress would use Art 2, Sec 4. It's called checks &amp; balances.
@DailyCaller I've been listening to these promises for the past 30 years and all I have to show for it is more nuclear waste. The stuff never goes away.
I'm a Giants fan and always be. I don't like the Dodgers and never will. But, you have 2 respect how well the Dodgers are playing right now.
@RepBarbaraLee @maddow So go to Rules Committee and get your amendment made in order. Quit whining.
I just can't watch SFG tonight. Clearly an odd numbered year. Still and always a Giant fan.
@LATSeema Is this a SNL parody?
@latimespolitics It is not possible to compare this too frequently to Neville Chamberlain returning from Munich. History repeats. Consequences to follow.
@washingtonpost Trump Admin fails on existential question in favor of sanctioning 12 pieces of silver. Where's Neville Chamberlain when you need him?
@FinancialTimes Trump Admin just gave Iran a pass on an existential issue in favor of sanctions on 12 pieces of silver. POTUS now owns Iran nuke deal.
@CNN How are those inspections going?
Iran compliant? Are you kidding me? This demeans sacrifices of Greatest Generation. This jeopardizes my children. You now own this blunder.
@richardcostigan @CalPERS Office props will follow retail props as tech continues to mature. 301 Capitol Mall is loser. I admire your focus on CALPers retirees
@McKeeverDoug @richardcostigan @CalPERS How did S&amp;P 500 do during same period?
@jonny_nor_cal @benvsacbiz @JMMuu CIM involvement is irrelevant. "Market" is moving against office edifices, just as it has w retail. Retirees will lose. Again, who benefits?
@gilliardda @DanielMorain Pull the plug. Hundreds of thousands already have. CK rolling over in his grave. Such a shame.
@kdeleon Yes!Yes!Yes! Calling all elected CA Dem officials: vote yes on cap &amp; trade! Great legacy for you! Gov Brown never on ballot again. 11/6/18.
@benvsacbiz @jonny_nor_cal @JMMuu Does CIM own the proj or is CALPers paying them a fee to manage the development? If it's a fee, you're making my pt: CALPers retirees lose.
@RalphNortham @EdWGillespie Are you a serious candidate?  This is gibberish.
@ccadelago Apples DO NOT belong on pizza. This is another example of the decline of western civilization. :)
@jonny_nor_cal @JMMuu Retail industry is showing what will happen to office market as tech advances. This proposal benefits someone other than CALPers retirees.
@jonny_nor_cal @JMMuu Legal obligation is to CALPers retirees. Again I ask: who benefits from building this white elephant that will depress returns?
@jonny_nor_cal @JMMuu Sell.
@LaCivitaC 50 years and counting. HBday!
@JMMuu @JulieGallaher @JeffBezos 10 yrs from now this CALPers investment w/b a white elephant depressing retiree returns. Office will follow retail. Who benefits here?
@thehill Clever. DOJ seeks civil forfeit vs R for human rts violatns. Obama DHS allows R lawyer in to fight chgs. R lawyer returns favor w DTJr mtg.
@DanielMorain This is absolutely the worst thing the Trump Administration has not yet fixed! Gov Brown/AG Becerra can add this to their anti-Trump agenda.
@PhilipRucker @thegarance Didn't Clinton/Brazile disclose before the debates that they had been given the q's? If so, alleged Russian hacking irrelevant. Drain swamp!
@Lrihendry @CookieOcean If you think passage of ACA was about healthcare then you need to re-evaluate.
@DailyCaller Hubris. Hyperbole. Hilarious. I hope all the Dems in the California Legislature vote for this. Gov Brown never on ballot again. 11/6/18.
@johnfinegan Nuclear waste. Highly radioactive. No way to treat it, regardless of what "generation" it is. Forever.
Problm w nuke power is what to do w waste.The stuff never goes away. Fukushima plan to dump in ocean terrible precedent. Shut them down.
@DailyCaller This is great news!!!
@TuckerCarlson @SueCaro1 Can anyone say "recent re-election campaign of Benjamin Netanyahu"?
@CA_DMV Who at the CA DMV posted this tweet?
Judge Watson again ruled against the travel ban. Usually, these decisions are prepared by the prevailing attorney. Who's writing for Watson?
@JerryBrownGov Remember: Governor Brown never on ballot again. To all CA Dems: please vote for this. 11/6/18.
@yashar @mattklewis Read Pres Bush 41 recent biography. This letter reflects his deep understanding of how the real world works. USA needs more ldrs like this.
@politico When people create legislation to address issues that they know little or nothing about in terms of how it works, you end up with Obamacare.
@JillFilipovic What do your parents think of your premise?
@FoxNews @FoxNewsInsider Can I get a copy before it goes to print? Asking for a friend.
@JoeNBC @BernieSanders Nice house, Bernie.
@bpolitics That means the the Senate Demicrats will vote against the bill. Follow the money that flows from US Treasury to insurance companies &amp; CEOs.
@DanielMorain Compromise on bad policy gives you bad policy. This is job killer, hammers low income earners. Calling all Ds: pls vote for this. 11/6/18 :)
@ValerieJarrett @toreyvanoot When nat'l security team showed you evidence on Russian attempts to interfere in election, did you say "Ignore it" or was that someone else?
@POLITICOMag First sentence of second to last paragraph is the understatement of the decade.
@matthewjdowd You nailed it. People either play golf by the rules or they don't. No gray area here. Game is a test of character.
@AHMalcolm This opportunity has been 30 years in the making dating back to Bush 41. Very good US policy sustained over years/administrations.
@Doranimated @pnjaban Paragraph 13 and paragraph 14 say it all. Sad state of affairs. Gov. Pat Brown is rolling over in his grave.  Current leadership failing.
@latimes PRC confirms: Xi is not leader of Taiwan. Interesting statement by PRC. Has PRC abandoned claim of hegemony over Taiwan?
@johnpodesta @thegarance @realDonaldTrump Respectfully, Mr. Podesta, your beef is with President Obama and AG Lynch. Very clear lines of responsibilities. Have you said this to them?
@AriFleischer Just keep running! Awesome!
@CNN @jaketapper I wish ppl wld do their job &amp; prevent such things. Pls ask former DNI what he did to stop alleged hacking? Did someone tell him 2 ignore it?
@CNN Did you ask the former DNI why he didn't do anything to stop the alleged hacking? Did someone tell the DNI to ignore the evidence?
@businessinsider Agreed. Why didn't you do something about it? Were you directed by someone to not do anything?
@NoahPollak @AriFleischer If u keep stating facts that embarrass Mr. Rhodes then I'll just..I'll just..oh forget it. Mr. Rhodes: go write a book. You're time is done.
@rebeccaballhaus Respectfully, Mr. Shaub, please provide evidence. Please be specific.
@ChadPergram You know this bill does not comply with constitutional requirements. Please stop grandstanding.
@ChadPergram Just like President Obama did.
@JoaquinCastrotx Is this against US law?  If it is illegal, then who is responsible for prosecuting the criminal acts? I would appreciate specific answers.
@AirForceTimes So the Bear says. The Bear always lies.
@DailyCaller Did any of these people "erroneously on rolls" actually vote in the most recent election?
@CillizzaCNN Depends on who writes them.
@kdeleon Respectfully, that is not the view of surviving family members who's parents/children/siblings are victims of crime by illegal aliens.
@ggreenwald @pnjaban Go ahead. Expose me.
@Reuters The Bear always lies.
@CNN This is story about a govt employee who left fed'l service to become a contractor so she could improve her earning power. Clever marketing.
@hipEchik #1 or #2: Iowa (rural setting) corn fields early evening with fireflies swarming.
@jaketapper Did Senator Sanders speak directly to Comey about this or have someone speak to Comey on his behalf?
@politico @maxbergmann This is such gibberish. Kerry is far and away the worst of the worst. Look no further than the Iran deal.
Giants win! Congratulations to Slania on his debut!
@cmaiduc @johnmyers @kdeleon Are the people who gather signatures required to use their real name?

@WSJ China has now made it clear what their price is for corralling North Korea: US relinquishes Taiwan.
@WSJ Boom! There it is....Taiwan is now connected to North Korea.
@cnnbrk @jaketapper There's something terribly wrong with this picture. Or is there?
Note to USTR: "Whatever your rules are for our products entering your country will be the rules for your products entering my country."
I anxiously await reports from Intel Comm re John Podesta's explaining why President Obama didn't do anything about alleged Russ'n hacking.
War in 21st Century done via proxy. Russia/Iran don't care about Assad or chem wpns. They are trying to tie up USA. Same w China re NoKo.
@NBCNews Despite the public's view, the Obama years can only be described as one foreign policy failure after another. DJT now having to clean it up.
@thehill No Red Line statements. If you say to Assad "Don't do it" then you have to back it up. Again. And again. And again. We are with you on this.
62 ends. 63 begins. Great wife. Great kids. Parents still with us. Sisters healthy. Life is good. Off to work. Lots to do. Have a GREAT DAY!
@FoxBusiness The Constitution requires tax legislation to originate in the House. Senators know this. Senate trying to jam House. Rivalry is fascinating.
@LoganDobson I really relish these tweets
@WhiteHouse @klummer2009 What I don't understand is: if 10.3m are presently covered, then how can AHCA cause 22m to lose coverage?
@DailyCaller Given President Obama's private talks with Putin about "handling it after the election", does the unwillingness to act amount to collusion?
@thehill "....preserve, protect and defend...."
@ccadelago Eggman doesn't have $7m. Where's he getting the money? Is he taking a management fee? That's a lot of money for the honey.
@ElkGroveNews @davidfrum Lol. Next time won't be a bluff.......or maybe it will be. :)
@joshtpm Parents of teenagers.
@DavidJollyFL A convo never heard. Clinton to Pelosi: "I won popular vote." Pelosi to Clinton: "You failed." C to P: "You're 0 for 4." P to C: "Go Home."
@washingtonpost Does this timeline go all the way back to Holder?
@DailyCaller Sen. Sanders: did you/did you not speak with or have someone speak wAG Lynch/Director Comey about FBI's Burlington College investigation?
@guypbenson Sen. Sanders: did you or did you not speak with AG Lynch/Director Comey about the FBI's investigation of Burlington College?
@CBSNews Probably estate planners.
@POLITICOMag Senator Sanders: did you or did you not discuss the Burlington College investigation with then-Director Comey, or then-AG Loretta Lynch?
With the FBI investigation looming at Burlington College, do you think Sen Sanders spoke with James Comey about it?
@CNN @DrJillStein No. You called for a recount so that people would contribute millions of dollars to you. How did you spend that money?
@itsonlywords @erickbrockway My two grandmothers would treat you very kindly and say: "That's nice." Then they'd move on to something important that needed attention.
@thehill Estate planning.
As with investigat'ns of POTUS that he always opines on, I anxiously await Sen Sanders' views about FBI investigat'n of Burlington College.
@DailyCaller Senator Sanders normally opines without hesitation about current FBI investigations. Does he have a comment on this one? I'd be interested.
@NBCNews No.....Russia SAYS they're firing cruise missiles at ISIS. The Bear always lies.
@WSJ Caused by sustained focus over multiple Administrations. Huge geopolitical impact. Very positive for US as a whole. Started with Bush 41.
@jmartNYT @McCormackJohn "....and I got the votes. See you at caucus meeting."
@CBSNews You are naive. Senate is using this issue to violate a Constitutional rqmt. Friction between the 2 chambers more interesting than R vs D.
@CBSNews I am so done with these people. They value power more than freedom. Drain the swamp!
@ChadPergram His testimony is that no one told him?  Are you kidding me? After FBI tells DNC, first call is to DHS due to jurisdictional rqmts.
@mkraju Who cares about disclosure? YOU KNEW ABOUT IT AND DID NOTHING!
@FoxNews And then YOU DID NOTHING!
@rebeccaballhaus What are you saying? What are you saying? You knew about it AND DID NOTHING! Why didn't you do your job and prevent it? YOU KNEW!
@CNNPolitics You knew this AND DID NOTHING!
@FoxNews SecJohnson: DHS is responsible for prevent'g this type of election tamper'g.Is it your testimony that you were unaware of it as it happened?
@CBSNews Secretary Johnson responsible for election security. Comet testified that FBI knew Russians were playing. Did FBI not tell DHS?
@FoxNews Taking sides?!  You mean like blaming Trump?!  It was your job to prevent this AND YOU DID NOTHING! Shame!
@kylegriffin1 @thegarance Secretary Johnson knew this was going on while it was going on AND DID NOTHING! Who else knew?
@dmartosko @pnjaban How does Sec Johnson know this? Because he "stepped aside" and watched as the Russians acted. He knew they were meddling AND DID NOTHING!
@AP How is this not a terrorist act?
@CillizzaCNN You're asking the wrong question. What you really want to know is the core supporters of Pelosi and why they support her. Much more here.
@TIMEPolitics @aabramson Who knew about it as it was happening? Obama for sure. Biden? Susan Rice? Loretta Lynch? Johnson? Who did anything about it? Crickets.
@ChadPergram Secretary Johnson knew this was going on AND DID NOTHING! That's a fact.
@CBSEveningNews Secretary Johnson knew the Russians were meddling AND DID NOTHING!
@JTanfani DHS knew this was happening AND DID NOTHING!
@ThisWeekABC And you knew they were doing it at the time AND DID NOTHING!
US actively opposing Russ'n efforts to dominate Euro natl gas mkt. This is right policy. Putin uses natl gas as weapon. Germany in crosshrs.
@kdeleon For some reason President Obama could never say "radical Islamic terrorists". It seems others have similar problem with the word "illegal".
@Reuters @specialreports President Obama has found his legacy. He must be so proud.
Only American that Kim cares about is DRodman. Hopefully Amb. Rodman will require the return of remaining Americans before visiting again.
3/3 8) reduce Govt regulation 9) repeal recent gas tax increase 10) lower cost of electricity by increasing supply
2/3 3) more law enforcement 4) repair CALPers debacle 5) build water storage 6) lower college tuition for STEM students 7) reduce income txs
1/3The candidate doing the following gets my vote for CA governor 2018. 10 point plan:	1) fix the roads;	2) fix K-12 educ, esp in poor areas
@JoeNBC This is the heart of what non-urban core voters realized. It lays bare the bankruptcy of ideas from the professional ruling class.
@DailyCaller Kap is an exciting football player. I respect his willingness to speak up. I hope there isn't any backlash but fans/owners have rights too.
@kdeleon @SenateGOP CA St Sen leader talking about US Senate. Sad. Try doing your current job. Start with fixing the roads. Then lower UC/CSUS tuition.
@sacbee_news Per Constitution, Congress writes bills to fund or not fund, POTUS signs or vetoes. Maybe Holder doesn't know this. Watch &amp; learn, or study.
@AmericaNewsroom @SenateRPC @SenJohnBarrasso ACA is current law. If it's failing then the nat'l Ds own it: they wrote it, they passed it, they implemented it. Why won't they run on it?
@Amy_Chance That's great! Raise gas taxes on poor,fund benefits for noncitizens,plunder CALPers, don't fix roads,raise UC/CSUS tuition, build choo choo.
@MarcosBreton I absolutely respect Mr. Kaepernick's freedom to speak his mind and I absolutely insist that I am under no obligation to purchase NFL tkts.
@rubycramer Huge payouts to political insidrs continue as fmr AG Holder gets huge contract with CA Legislature. When will the roads be fixed?
@SenKamalaHarris @joshtpm Respectfully, Senator, did you say the same thing to President Obama and Speaker Pelosi and Leader Reid when ACA was up for a vote?
@TheMarkTwain @Capitol_Weekly Except in Big Sur.
@brhodes POTUS/Rhodes make mistake after mistake for 8 yrs. Clinton promises 4 more years. It clearly surprises Mr Rhodes that Americans care.
@kdeleon When the details of the budget become public, the public will know if it's business as usual or if what Senator Leon says is true.
@RoyBlunt Former SoS Kerry recently met with Iran Forgn Mnstr to disparage critics of the Obama Iran deal. How does Webster's define treason?
@DailyCaller Will ballots be printed in Klingon?
@MarcosBreton Arm yourself.
@RoguePOTUSStaff @jodikyman Inappropriate. Please take this down.
@MarcosBreton I wonder what the outcome would have been in SF had the people being attacked also had weapons. You're still my friend.
@FoxNews @GovernorVA This is misleading. Gov TM's info is from the Brady Center, which says 32 are murdered. The remaining deaths are not due to violence.
@BigMeanInternet Inappropriate. Please take this down.
@WSJ Reality. Actors "out there" wish to do us harm. We either deal with those challenges or fail our ancestors/descendants. Leadership matters.
Today, former SOS Kerry sat w his Iranian opposite to disparage any criticisms of the Obama Iran deal. There are no words to explain this.
@thehill Gov Brown: pls do what you were elected to do: fix the roads, fix the schools, fix CalPERS, fix the dams, fix the levees,start immediately.
@CNN Thats a $9 billion decision per market trading today.
@CNN Rodman best one on one defender ever. Kim thinks Rodman is the Secretary of Defense.
@WSJ Who operates the ports at the north and south ends of the Panama Canal? This growing closeness between Panama &amp; PRC is a problem for US.
@AmericaRising IMO GHWB will be judged as one of the our best Presidents: paid his dues, understood the world as it is, served his country honorably.HBdy!
@CNNPolitics Landing in Pyongyang. Renting a Trabant to go meet up.  Scheduled discussion topics: haircuts, jewelry, trash talking, dance moves, ICBMs
@cnnbrk But not yet confirmed by the Senate.
@thehill State/Local govt sets many rules. People/Businesses/Consumers have the right to live/operate/shop where they want. Let's see what happens.
@CNN Whether you supported President Carter or not, this is awesome on so many levels. Thank you, Mr. President.
@CaHSR_Scam Was GJB negotiating to buy steel rails for HSR to go with the structural bolts for Bay Bridge or rebar for Oroville spillway? Fix the roads!
@CaHSR_Scam No. Gov JB did not get royally manipulated by the Chinese attempting to interfere in domestic US politics. Sure glad we got HSR choo choo!
@jacobperry @EWErickson The promise of socialism: everyone drowns together. The promise of capitalism: get out of bed and go to work. Each of us gets to choose.
@johnmyers Record tax rcpts this year. Ds raise taxes. Roads still bad. Schools still failing. Gangs/drugs still rampant. Thx for the HSR choo choo!
@ccadelago No amount of talking pts can hide that CA Dems OWN this tax increase. Thx for the HSR choo choo train nobody wants or needs. Fix the roads!
Curry/Durant/Thompson/Green/Zaza vs Jordan/Pippen/Grant/Paxton/Cartwright vs Magic/Worthy/Jabbar/Scott/Rambis. Round robin. I'd buy tix!
Today's arrival in Poland of LNG from US is excellent geopolitical move years in the making. It directly undermines 1 Russian stranglehold.
@USATODAY Nothing funny in this. Pot - meet kettle.
@kcranews This is pain. It's caused by illegal drug use. The persons selling this poison do it for money. How come legalization advocates ignore this?
@AriFleischer Holder had all the secrets. He and Mrs Obama and Jarrett were the puppetmasters.
@DailyCaller She broke the law. Was hired to protect nat'l security; instead she disclosed sensitive intel. No gray area here. Not a patriot. No way.
@ABC Welcome to North Korea. No cars. No food. No jobs. Except for sycophantic leadership. Who cares what Muttonhead thinks?
@AirForceTimes She handled classified info. For personal reasons she disclosed the info. Yes, she should be worried. Probably forgot Obama no longer there
@thehill Is this a joke?
Do you think the PRC manipulation of Gov Brown is more or less egregious than the alleged Russian hacking in terms of domestic US politics?
@CBSSacramento Press statement from Gov Brown: "This type of pricing undermines my HSR choo choo train. I'm directing AG Becerra to immediately file suit."
@SenRubioPress Gov Brown in PRC negotiating "climate" deals betw CA &amp; PRC. Are they unenforceable? Thanks for funding unneeded HSR choo choo train.
@DailyCaller Amend Gardendale municipal code: "Individuals under the age of 21 who cut fewer than ten lawns per week are exempt from bus. license rqmt."
@WashTimes He declined because Handel was going to hammer him for lying his ossoff.
@AriFleischer Only person in US who didn't believe Benghazi was terrorism was Pres Obama. The only other ppl who refused to call it that worked for him.
@GuruofSpread @jasongay If this is about Mickelson, then good for him for going to the ceremony. He's her dad. Family first.
Seeing the Giants trailing the Dodgers is painful. Time running out. Come on G-Men!
@thehill Why didn't President Obama do something about this Russian meddling when he was told about it?  Was Russian meddling "Red Line behavior"?
@DRUDGE_REPORT This is a crime. Been happening for years. Thx for the choo choo train.
@CNN I saw VP Gore conduct the 2000 tally of electoral votes. He was exceptional that day. I respect him for that. I disagree with his POV here.
@CNN Why didn't you present the Paris Accord to the Senate for ratification? Ds held majority at the time.
@kylegriffin1 @thegarance Why didn't President Obama present the Paris Accord to the Senate for ratification? Ds held majority at the time.
@ThisWeekABC @NancyPelosi Why didn't President Obama present the Paris Accord to the Senate for ratification? Ds held majority at the time.
@ABCPolitics Why didn't President Obama present the Paris Accord to the Senate for ratification? Ds held majority at the time.
@ThisWeekABC @NancyPelosi Why didn't President Obama ask the Senate to confirm the Paris Accord? Ds held majority at the time.
@businessinsider C'est la vie.
@politico Are the roads and bridges in Washington and New York as good as they are in CA? Asking for a friend who supports HSR choo choo train.
@cmarinucci @JerryBrownGov @politico @davidsiders CA political leadership already lives in a fantasy world.  Might as well make it official. I hope they have better roads and bridges.
@GovHowardDean Make sure you tell this to all your friends in Michigan.
@DineshDSouza @slone @elonmusk @realDonaldTrump I am delighted by Musk's success. I hope his business thrives. I live in a different world in which Paris Accord compliance would hurt.
The American making $34,000/yr w/a mortgage and kids to support doesn't care about Paris Accord. Elites don't grasp real world reality.
@ZachMontellaro @POLITICOMag I detest the commercials for their hubris.....but this was a VERY INTERESTING article. Thanks for tweeting it.
@RiegerReport Do you think GS has taken financial positions based on implementing the Paris Accord?
@businessinsider How will contracts for delivery be enforced?
@thehill How come the only people celebrating the Paris Accord or cap and trade are very wealthy or elected officials that don't buy their own gas?
@AriFleischer Will this fix our roads and bridges?
@TomSteyer How's that carbon footprint Tom? Still own your own jet, Tom? How big is your house, Tom? How many cars do you own, Tom?  Nice watch, Tom.
@jrpsaki @thegarance @realDonaldTrump I witnessed your work at Obama State Dept. Who are you working for now?
@carolynlochhead Won't happen. With the exception of NYC and Chicago, the rest of the country does not want to be California. Go figure!
Re the landslide in Big Sur: who owns the land that was created?
@latimes In the meantime, under California law, who owns the new acreage?
@DailyCaller Presidential kids are off limits.  Presidential kids are off limits.  Presidential kids are off limits. Presidential kids are off limits.	Pr
@Heritage But...but...but President Obama promised it would! Redefining the word "foolish". Secondary redefinition: "naive".
@AirForceTimes The Russians told you they were targeting ISIS or you know this from telemetry? The Bear always lies.
@NYCMayor @jackfitzdc Supports unilateral action by 44. Opposes unilateral action by 45.	Takes unilateral action. Mind boggling consistency.
DJT decision to w/d from Paris shows folly of BHO decision to sign: no Senate appr'l = not binding. Ds now complain about unilateral acts.
@ChadPergram Pres Obama's decision to commit US to Paris was unilateral and never binding. Senate never consented. You know this. Quit making things up.
@POLITICOMag Obamacare. Solyndra. TBTF. Iran nuke deal. Syrian Red Line. Release of Guantanamo terrorists. DACA. Presidential pardons. Shall I go on?
@businessinsider If he was asleep in his car, then how can he be cited for DUI? Asking for a friend.
Clarity:there's been no change to healthcare law since 1/20/17. Obamacare remains in full force and effect. Natl Ds say: "You're welcome!"
@HistoryInPix Why do you lie like this?
@redsteeze @guypbenson The applicable law is the one the natl Dems jammed down America's threat without any Repub support. The Dems OWN this outcome.
@RogerNiello Did I hear correctly that Aaron Rodgers and Marshawn Lynch have gone for another Cal degree? Do they have any eligibility remaining?
@kenjbarnes1 @RKHorry @SacramentoKings Can you say "6 rings"?
@CNN These eloquent words  characterize the dilemma every POTUS must confront: what is my duty? IMO 44 never fully grasped "USA always first".
@greta No.
@latimes Voters see diff between acts of nature vs political decisions that damage infrastructure. Dem ldrs response never changes: raise taxes.
@USATODAY Law specifically exempts farming due to # of senators from Ag states. This is another policy overreach from pre-1/20/17.
@AriFleischer Occurred on Obama's watch:hacking,Benghazi,Syria chm wpns,Iran deal,Venezuela,NoKo nukes,opioid problem. Was BHO manipulated or just a fool?
@OKnox This conclusion is based on the assumption that the Iranians will abide by the terms of the deal. Naive.
@ComsAlex What are study's assumptions?Only way this happens is gas goes sky high. Any town w/connection to auto industry gets pounded. I'm skeptical.
Are the Giants finding their swagger? 8-2 last ten games. Keep it going!
@kdeleon I hope Dem leaders of CA continue to preach to rest of USA how all states s/b like CA. Likely result is permanent minority status for Ds.
@DailyCaller This entire story is so sad. Ambition and arrogance run amok.
Calling CA voters names b/c they disagree with your policies is deplorable. Gov Brown should know better than to do this.
@ElmetsPR There s/b a massive nonpartisan protest in front of the Turkish Embassy. I'd go if I could. Show these thugs what America really is about.
@kdeleon The State of CA provides iretirement security programs for its employees. How's that working out? Now it wants to do that for everyone. Hmmm
@thehill Potato, potatoe. President, not president. Winner, whiner. Move on. Get a job. Write a book. You lost. It's over.
@MattRexroad Think through how this happens including complicity of prim care docs. Add in the unreimbursed use of hospital resources. Now be disgusted.
@AriFleischer Declare them persona non grata/expel. Need non-partisan massive follow up protest at Turkish Embassy. Need to show this isnt acceptable.
@AriFleischer This point is precise. I doubt we will see any recognition of this in the media. Keep up the good work Ari.
@TimSheehanNews @FresnoBeeBob There's going to be some unhappy cows!
@CalRoundtable @sacbee Ignoring such failure has &amp; continues to condemn generations of students to lower std of living. Shame on them. But choo choo train on track
With today's decline on the stock market, the state of CA could now buy Southwest Airlines and United Airlines for estimated cost of HSR.
@DanielMorain These attempts to address real everyday issues must stop. The CTA knows what's best for your child in school. Stop being impertinent.
@latimes Automatic:choo choo train underway;infrastructure crumbling;crime rate up;taxes on poor people rising. Leaders clearly earning their pay.
@kcranews $60 billion choo choo train = 150,000 houses at $400,000 each. Just saying.
@MarketWatch As an employer, can someone define my liabilities if an employee wreaks havoc after smoking weed?
@RobStutzman I know you're a Dodger fan. Beat LA!
@AriFleischer Ari - no, that was just President Obama and AG Holder being cool. I'm surprised at you. Even the MSM knew this was just coolness.
@NBCPolitics What I don't understand is: if DT asking Comey to drop an investigation is obstruction of justice, then what is it when Comey sits on info?
@RedAlert This is so.........amazing. Not.
@WaltersBee Please stop trying to change the subject from how great the $60 billion choo choo train will be! The kids can wait! All aboard!
@KQED Sen Harris is so wise. We are so lucky to have her working for us.
@WaltersBee @RobStutzman Dan - I had forgotten about all that. Good catch. More like a hammer!
@thehill When Rahm left D.C., natl Dems began to drift. FWIW, in voters minds, Dem Pty plan is now about illegals and abortion rights. Voters get it.
@businessinsider It would be interesting to know how the parents of young people hooked on illegal drugs feel about prosecuting the rats who sell this poison
@MarcosBreton Beat LA! That's what matters. Just think how Dodgers brass feels about their pitching after last night. Kershaw awaits. Beat LA!
@kcranews Seems like there's jurisprudence req'g = treatment before the law. Lots of noise, not a lot of substance. Achieved goal of media attention.
@latimes This is the only freeway in CA where the lanes are striped bright red.
@thehill Perhaps Senator Paul will introduce legislation to amend existing law. Do or don't do. There is no try.
@LaCivitaC @penguins Jim Beam loves the Pens!
@MattRexroad @therealautoblog DONT LOOK AT THIS!  This type of market ingenuity imperils the HSR choo choo train. People need to stop undermining the HSR boondoggle.
@DailyCaller The food being served in USDA food programs is due to contracts executed before 1/20/17.  If there is failure here, it's on President Obama.
@slone You can fix that!
@latimes How is law enforcement dealing with drug abuse in AG Becerra's former congressional district? Could be a precursor for CA in near future.
@carolynlochhead Dems complain re slow apptmt process. DT in no hurry with any of these depts. Now he pins lack of progress on Sen DiFi. Chess not checkers.
@Anthony_Cave @ABC10 The Brown Doctrine: Record revenues, record spending, new gas taxes, failing infrastructure,ignore the problems behind that curtain.
@politico @POLITICOMag This is Mainstream Delusional. Pelosi thinks this is hilarious.
@DailyCaller Call it what it is: squandering 50 years of American influence and concerted effort to control chemical weapons. "Imperfect" understates it.
@hooverwhalen And yet....the roads are terrible and the folks in lower income brackets are paying more in fuel taxes. The New Democratic Way!

@CapRadioNews Millions of $ for illegals but only pennies for porridge. What would Oliver say? "Please Sir, may I have more?" Is this policy upside down?
@jdelreal Note the commonality of structural failure at 2 projects decades apart: no rebar/bad soil in Oroville, low quality nuts/bolts on Bay Bridge.
@DailyCaller All current USDA food nutrition programs were executed by prior Administration. If there's failure here, it's on President Obama.
@latimes Can we please get our roads fixed? $15 million buys a lot of road repair.
@CNN All current USDA food nutrition contracts were executed by Obama Administration. If there's failure here, it's on President Obama.
@newsbusters De Niro one of my favorite actors. However, the daily challenges he faces are far different than mine. These agencies are not existential.
@ccadelago @davidaxelrod Washington was never photographed.......smiling? :)
@politico @POLITICOMag This is delusional.
@DailyCaller Except that your husband has been in charge of USDA good nutrition programs for the last eight years and this contracts end 9/30/17.
@latimes The estim'd cost of this boondoggle is enough to buy Southwest Airlines twice over. Why not do that &amp; give free passage to all? The Dem Way!
@SpillaneCa Strongly disagree with premise that turning a blind eye to these rats selling poison to our citizens is good policy. You're still my friend.
Imagine outcry if 10000 Americans died in combat. 10000+ died in 2015 from drug abuse. Leadership matters. I hope AG Sessions is serious.
@SpillaneCa Pls explain your conclusion to members of the worst club in world: parents of kids who have used illegal drugs and died. 10000+ in 2015.
@CahnEmily For what purpose are you conflating radical Islamic terrorism with Islam?
@RobStutzman Lol
I am so tired of reading of lives/communities being destroyed by illegal drug use/trade. Hunt down the kingpins. No more winks/nods/blind i.
Speaking of CA HSR choo choo train: for the $60+ billion estimated cost to construct, you could buy Southwest Airlines twice.
Core US policy focus beg 1/20/01 has been to impose US influence in oil markets. Even Saudis admit it's been success. Huge benefits to USA.
The Russian Bear ALWAYS lies. It does not matter what the issue is. The phrase "...the whole truth..." does not exist in the Russian govt.
@Acosta Be advised: The Russian Bear ALWAYS lies. Act accordingly.
@tabberg This is not a new idea, but it is one that CA Democratic leaders don't support. Too old school for them. Lack of oxygen in ivory tower.
@RobStutzman Dean Wormer would like to speak with you.
@thehill How does that happen? Delusional. Pelosi 2012: we're taking back House. Pelosi 2014: we're taking back House. Pelosi 2016 ditto. Pls stay.
@ElmetsPR Stand off between USSS and FBI?
@BenKuchera More qualified than Bush 41? On what basis? History will judge Bush 41 as an exceptional president.
@kcranews How will this happen? What is the legal threshold for being "high"?
@brhodes @thegarance Dear Mr. Rhodes: is this a Red Line?
@UnrulyUnruh @CapitolAlert Holder recommended it?
@AP_Politics "North Korea is under control""It was caused by an internet video""I'll have more flexibility after the election""You can keep your doctor"
@washingtonpost On the other hand.....
@kdeleon You have all the answers yet don't understand the question.  Politics as usual isn't working for CA. Good luck running for US Senate.
@starsandstripes This was a good man and an American patriot. It was an honor to meet him.
@ByronYork Pelosi 2012: Ds will retake the House. Pelosi 2014: Ds will retake the House. Pelosi 2016: Ds will retake the House. I love reruns!
@kdeleon What would your dad say?
@kdeleon Dem ldrs refuse to take care of our roads while bldg choo choo trains, support open borders, raise gas taxes on poor. That's embarrassing.
If an indiv wants to create a retirement svngs prgm, current federal law allows them easily to do that. State govt involvement unnecessary.
@CNN @jimsciutto Subpoena her.
@LarrySabato When a Repub Sec of State sets up a home server against rules, receives classified info, gets hacked &amp; runs for POTUS, I want FBI to act.
@AriFleischer Precise connection of dots.
@WaltersBee @sacbee_news Who is John Galt?
@CNN "Please return to your seats...."
The spending bill limits funds to DOJ re marijuana law enforcement. Bad idea. Huge consequences to employers and parents. Defining moment.
@thedailybeast Mr. Colbert: Respectfully, what is the point of saying this type of thing?
@FoxNews @FoxNewsSunday Sen Schubert has been minority leader for 125 days. Failed w/SCOTUS delay, failed to prevent Trump exec orders. Hardly a success from D POV.
@DRUDGE_REPORT Shrewd move geopolitically.
@hale_razor @BarackObama Mama needs a new pair of shoes. :)
@politicalwire This is clever: what Kim wants most is respect. I am skeptical he gives up his nukes for kind words only.
@TEN_GOP @SteveWorks4You @SenWarren Perhaps there could be comparative autopsies. When autopsy is done on Sen Warren, do you think the results will confirm she is empty suit?
@sacbee_news Rs picking up two rural Dem Minnesota seats in 2018. Pelosi to hold net losses to one seat?
@politico @NancyPelosi 2012 Pelosi: we will take back House. 2014 Pelosi: we will take back the House. 2016 Pelosi: we will take back the House. I love her!
@businessinsider Lol. No jobs.
Susan Rice had obligation to disclose all details of the Iran deal. It is clear now why she didn't. Sec Rice: please go home, you're done.
@thehill Please please please. Don't let this person retire from public office.
@ABCPolitics @NancyPelosi @jonkarl I pray every day that you continue to insist on being the minority leader.
@ByronYork I wonder what the survivors of the crash victims think.
@thehill Nice house. Nice guest quarters. Nice perimeter wall. Nice second house, too. Is there a third house we're missing?
@guypbenson I do not believe that Larry Tribe wrote this about Erickson.
@kdeleon @realDonaldTrump @EPAScottPruitt The reality is that you live in an ivory tower where the taxpayer or campaign contributors pick up all your daily expenses. Must be nice.
@FaceTheNation I always thought this was the best of Pres Clinton's one liners. It accurately captures our system of checks and balances.
@kdeleon This is de typical Dem response. Under this logic, tax increases help middle class. What rubbish. This guy doesn't understand private sector
Republicans trying to do too much in one fell swoop. Change tactics. Take AHA apart in pieces. Slow/steady wins the race.
@AriFleischer Legislating is a process. Use the process. Take it apart in pieces.
@MarcosBreton We could do it at Gibson Ranch!
@kdeleon Why do you oppose legal immigration?
@USATODAY The federal govt can't take proper care of the land they controlled prior to creating these 3 monuments. Common sense -&gt; stop adding more.
If UC used hidden $175m to defray tuition, how much would each student save? Who appointed the people in charge? Who holds them to account?
@HJTA Who appointed these people to positions of leadership so important to our state? Why are our CA children unable to attend UC even w/4.0 GPA?
@AriFleischer Requiring a supermajority never adopted by Founders. They likely were as concerned w/tyranny by the minority as w/tyranny by the majority.
IMO Obama getting $400k for a speech is the swamp sending a message to all other potential former presidents:: "We will take care of you."
@KCRAMiller @kcranews Glad that's cleared up. For a moment I thot it might just have been the lack of regular maintenance. Lucky we're building a choo choo train.
@johnmyers @JerryBrownGov Now....if we can just find somebody else to pay for it. Maybe we can run the choo choo train down the same right of way. All aboard!
@piersmorgan Sorry I missed it. My wife said I couldn't go.
@ccadelago If market driven, then no one would care. Obviously, it's not market driven. Voters ask why is Govt bldg something no one wants or needs?
@brhodes @chrislhayes Still unclear to me why you lied about nat'l security issues. Go home. Write a book. Your time is up. You had your chance &amp; messed up bigly.
@Edpilkington @chrislhayes Who cares? This guy murdered a woman and tried to kill an 11 year old girl. Good riddance to bad trash!
@CaHSR_Scam @CalPolicyCenter "Abandon all hope yes who enter here." This guy figured out the this is a Potemkin solution to our infrastructure needs and jumped off train
@DaytonPubPolicy @CaHSR_Scam What is the interest rate on these bonds? How many teachers would that pay for?
@DaytonPubPolicy @CaHSR_Scam What do the required accompanying documents say about ridership/revenue projections? All aboard!
@rollcall Won't happen in California because we are building a $64 billion choo choo train. All aboard!
@kdeleon @LatinoCaucus Do applicants have to use their real name?
@MSNBC Maybe. If true it's because you set the thresholds for compliance so low as to make this foolishness an existential question. Very poor job.
Why do national Democrats like Warren/Sanders/Pelosi oppose legal immigration?
@latimes Wait a minute!!! That's a $39B increase in cost! Where did this number come from? If true, what happens with rest of infrastructure needs?
@CAproTem @USAGSessions Why do you oppose legal immigration?
@thegarance Those parts of the country that follow the law are celebrating this behavior b/c all that federal money will be re-allocated
@rollcall In CA infrastructure repair starts with construction of a choo choo train. Go figure.
@ReutersPolitics People need to stop opposing legal immigration.
@Reuters I wish people would stop trying to diminish legal immigration. Legal immigration has been a great thing for USA.
@sacbee_news When is the IRS going to stop trying to intimidate me into paying higher taxes?
@HJTA Governor Brown still has two years left.
@hooverwhalen Interesting irony in comparing Obama/Israel/France with attempts by others to interfere in foreign elections. Will we hear from pundits?
@Cernovich @slone Results flawed. Not enough response options.
@kdeleon @kcrw @KPCC @KQED @KPBSnews Political speech should not be funded by the government. That's been one of de fundamental tenets of our republic.
@DailyCaller In the real world that's called a vacation. How does this qualify as a reprimand? Shameful.
@greta Under Obama USA sees Iran as peer. Then Obama tho't the mullahs always told truth. His diplo team now claims ignorance. Ignorant fits.
@PublicCEO This will have to wait. We're building a choo choo train first.
@kdeleon Will you be proposing state legislation to carve out safe spaces for selected criminal violations? If not, please explain why not.
@kdeleon @SenatorCollins Can we get some road repairs here please? We don't need new taxes; just send de asphalt.
@DailyCaller Good riddance to bad trash.
@WestWingReport Please don't ask why aren't there enough Americans to fill these jobs. Direct challenge to NEA, who will say: "We need more funding."
@Maimzini @kfbk Are you done talking about nkorea?
@LANow Exactly!  I mean: why would the Berkeley cops do any investigation?
@danpfeiffer @thegarance Anyone who is or has been married got this exactly!! WE LOVED IT! Go FLOTUS!
@BennettJonah @DailyCaller It also caused a crack in Greenland glacier. :)
@greta Send that Hollywood producer that said we should deal with ISIS with love.
@dakasler This is less than 1/100 of what is being spent on choo choo train. Obviously, choo choo train more valuable.
@CNN This is called: "On message." Keep it up.
@brhodes @GlennThrush Good morning Mr Rhodes. You failed. NK has nukes. Iran on path for nukes. Africa a mess. Go home. Write a book. Your time is over.
@LisPower1 @CahnEmily I LOVE IT! Go FLOTUS!
@AriMelber @MSNBC North Korea: Dennis Rodman.
@RideSacRT Build more freeways. Maintain the roads better. Lower the price of fuel.
@RideSacRT Widen the freeways. Maintain local roads better. Lower the price of fuel.
@ComptonUnified @kdeleon That is quite good compared to many others. I am impressed. Thank you for sharing.
@politics_n_prep @guypbenson "ITS IN THE BILL OF RIGHT!"
@kdeleon @ComptonUnified That's great! What's the high school graduation rate in your district?
@FoxNews I recommend Mr Fox as the initial emissary to ISIS.  Does that position require Senate confirmation?
@ElmetsPR Invite Chris Mathews, too.
@RideSacRT Maintain existing roadways better. Widen the freeway for more lanes. Lower the price of fuel.
@SacBeeEditBoard Mr. Secretary: please exercise healthy skepticism.
@SacBeeEditBoard Quit trying to change subject away from wonderful choo choo train. Shame on you for talking jobs when you could be talking choo choo train.
@businessinsider Lol. Incentives matter.
@CBSNews The score right now: Trump 1, Sanders 0.
@juliehdavis @thegarance Second translation or second piece of pie? Hard to know for sure.
@kcranews It's just gas in the atmosphere.
@thehill Depends on the fee. Valerie Jarrett gets $30k for a speech. Lol. Urban is much bigger star.
@ChadPergram I remember Pelosi demanding the same of President Obama. How'd that work out?
@SacBeeEditBoard 2nd to last paragr: "we" didn't chose to "do nothing". Former Pres Obama had responsibility to decide what to do, &amp; he chose to do nothing.
@KatyTurNBC @NBCPolitics @SenMarkey No, they won't.
@POLITICOMag Given recent revelations about various foreign policy issues 2009-2016, are you referring to when former President Obama was in office?
@KFIAM640 Nice pearl necklace.
@GrassleyPress @ChuckGrassley Who's going to protect Aaron Rodgers?
@KellyO On a wide body jet. Seat K 9.
@sacbee_news Oh man! Where's Biff when you need him?
@HashtagGriswold @AriFleischer Excellent connection of dots.
@RedState Why didn't you tell this to the American people?
@kenvogel He did. He showed Putin/Assad/the world that challenging the US 2009-2016 had no adverse results. Great college class. Easy midterm &amp; final.
@JoeNBC These people knew AT THAT TIME that former President Obama was wrong and they lacked the integrity to resign. They are complicit/embarassed.
@guypbenson How about: "Ineffective", "Naive", "Foolish", "Flawed"
@joshuahersh @thegarance Former President Obama was obviously smarter than everyone else. We have no appreciation of how lucky we were to have him work for us.
@JoeNBC He was shallow in Illinois legislature. He was shallow in US Senate. He was shallow as POTUS. Challenging Carter for #1.
@StuPolitics Hi Stuart. The only policy at issue here is: No one shall use chemical weapons. That has been US policy for a long time.
@HotlineJosh Your standards are apparently John Kerry and/or Hillary Clinton. You need new standards.
@margbrennan @MajorCBS He doesn't need notes to speak about a world he is very well experienced in. Definitely not John Kerry.
@WSJPolitics This was narrowly tailored attack re use of chem weapons makes clear there are advocates for not taking out Assad. I'm interested in why.
@Pete4CA @BarackObama @michaeldweiss @AC360 America did not squander American credibility. That award goes to former President Obama.
@AP Hard words from someone who knows how the world works. Definitely not John Kerry.
@AshPratte @murphymike That's not the message. The message was: use chemical weapons at your own peril. It's the use of chemical weapons that is getting attention.
@tabberg We're at $1 b'n and counting. Watch the hyenas!
@JoeNBC She lies. Repeatedly. Over and over. About very serious matters. Why does anyone give her any credibility? She lies. Do you understand?
@FlashReport Tough call, but I do not concur. :)
@ca_trans_agency @GovPressOffice @CaltransHQ @CaCities @CSAC_Counties @FixCARoads @CaAlliance4Jobs @Rendon63rd @kdeleon @Transport_CA You already have the money. You're spending it on a choo choo train. If you were serious you'd spend that $25 b'n on roads.
@ccadelago @1KatieOrr Respectfully: You signed off on much of it. Reverse your course. Start with your choo choo train. $25 b'n. That's a lot of road repair.
@RD108Irrigation @CaRicefarmer71 So endangered that you can only find them where you look for them.
@LorettaSacBee Record tax inflow. Failing schools. Unaffordable housing. Unsafe neighborhoods. Impassable roads. Gov de Brown/Sen Leon respond: raise taxes
@Humankindvideos @USATODAY @ronclarkacademy AWESOME!
@kdeleon Delusional. Record tax revenue. Failing schools. Unaffordable housing. Unsafe neighborhoods. Impassable roads. Your only answer: raise taxes
@AriFleischer Lol.
@LATpoliticsCA Leadership matters. Schools failing. Housing unaffordable. Neighborhoods unsafe. Roads impassable. "Send more money!"
@mcgreevy99 Taxes at all time high. Schools failing. Housing unaffordable. Neighborhoods unsafe. Roads impassable. Gov Brown solution? More taxes.
@ccadelago Leadership matters. Schools failing. Housing unaffordable. Neighborhoods unsafe. Roads impassable. Gov Brown's solution? Raise taxes.
@sacbee_news This is sad: a lifetime of experience in public life reduced to always proposing the same solution: we need more taxes.
@latimes Lol. Too late. The answer to every Govt problem is not: raise taxes. Leadership matters.
@CaCities @kdeleon $25 b'n for a choo choo train. This is not just an inconvenience. This defines squandering of resources. Don't worry: we'll just raise taxes
@mcgreevy99 That's your legacy rather than a choo choo train. Different decade, same policy. 1974-1982 policies = 2010-2018 policies re roads.
@mcgreevy99 $25 b'n for a choo choo train nobody needs vs $5.2 b'n for roads everyone wants. This isnt leadership; Gov Brown putting lipstick on a pig.
@FoxNews @POTUS This is key theme. Opens up lots of opportunities for geopolitical moves when you don't worry about what the ldr of (pick a country) thinks.
@scottshafer @1KatieOrr Every elected official in every other state is delighted by this. This is political malpractice.
@KFIAM640 Help him succeed.
@ccadelago @tatecurtis @akoseff Is Governor de Brown DiFi's younger brother? Asking for a friend.
@KFIAM640 Obviously we need a choo choo train. Governor de Brown and Senator Leon and Assemblyman Renner have cut the deal. CA taxpayers pay up.
@Cernovich No No No. It was an internet video.
@CalChamber @kdeleon @AllanZaremberg Hi Allen. Regular folks want to know why CA is spending $25 b'n on choo choo train instead of using that money to fix roads. Ask'g 4 friend.
@MattRexroad @RogerNiello The Brown Doctrine: talk talk talk about infrastructure for 6 years, spend all the money on silly choo choo train no one needs, raise taxes.
@RealClearNews Who cares? Asking for a friend.
@kcranews Here's the deal: Governor Brown takes the heat for increasing taxes, Legislature protects funding for his choo choo train, taxpayers pay up.
@RepMikeRogers This is wisdom.
@JerryBrownGov @GovPressOffice Sir: if truly your position then you wouldn't be spending $25 b'n on a choo choo train that nobody needs vs $5.2 b'n on roads people want.
@RogerNiello @johnmyers $10 billion here, $10 billion there, that's only $10 billion spent, right?
@asmMelendez @ABC10 @sami_gallegos This has a familiar ring to it. BTW -$25 billion for choo choo train protected vs $5.2 billion in new taxes. "Ignore the man behind curtain"
@ccadelago @JerryBrownGov Your choo choo train is not basic.
@SovernNation @JerryBrownGov Why'd you leave out the last part of the quote: ".....and ignore the $25 billion being spent on my choo choo train."?
@SovernNation @JerryBrownGov Based on spending, choo choo trains at $25 billion is lot more fundamental than $5.2 billion for roads.
@ccadelago @kdeleon @RendonAnthony Assemblyman Rendon is correct. Imagine how much could be repaired if $25 billion was spent on roads we need instead of choo choo trains.
@ccadelago @Jimbealljr Your choice is: $25 billion for choo choo train vs $5.2 billion in new taxes. "Ignore that man behind the curtain!"
@MelodyGutierrez @SFGate $25 billion for choo choo train that no one wants vs $5.2 billion for roads that everybody uses. "Ignore that man behind the curtain!"
@businessinsider Show us the report identifying the sanctuary cities. What is the date of issuance?
@wolfblitzer @SenSanders @realDonaldTrump @CNN Ask yourself: why didn't the Russians hack Senator Sanders?
@cmarinucci @kdeleon $25 billion for a choo choo train protected vs $5.2 billion in new taxes. "Ignore that man behind the curtain!"
@ccadelago @Steve_Glazer $25 billion for a choo choo train protected vs $5.2 billion in new taxes. "Ignore that man behind the curtain!".
@DafnaLinzer @marcorubio Finally someone is thinking through what was going on and why former Pres Obama didn't care.
@kdeleon $25 Billion for a choo choo train is protected while you reflexively resort to more taxes. No wonder voters have lost faith.
@WashTimes Airline sets rules. Rules obviously allow this. I'd fly that airline just to say thank you. Suggest airline ban Prof under 1A.
@RealClearNews Is this a legally obtained video per AG Becerra?
@ccadelago @JerryBrownGov What does the choo choo train cost us?
@lfangonilo How's the eyebrow?
@LATpoliticsCA This looks suspiciously like the Republican approach. I appreciate Senator Leon's effort.
@SacBeeEditBoard Then why are our state government leaders all onboard with building a choo choo train?
@AriFleischer Good morning Ari. Pelosi loves this strategy.
@CalChamber No Republican sponsors yet. Hard ball politics celebrated in Sacramento, bemoaned in Washington DC. Go figure.
@YamsTV No state income tax in the state of Washington.
@FoxNews Try harder!
@latimes State leaders provide $25 billion for a choo choo train no one needs vs billing CA taxpayers $5.2 billion for roads all CA used.
@kcranews no
@FlashReport Here's the deal on infrastructure plan: Legislature protects choo choo train, Governor supports raising taxes.
@CapitolAlert @FlashReport Only six years for the Ds to create this plan. Who'd have ever thought the Ds would raise taxes as a solution?
@SovernNation @JerryBrownGov Imagine how much roadwork could be done if the money wasn't being diverted to build a choo choo train.
@Anthony_Cave @ABC10 @JerryBrownGov And it's common nonsense to continue building a fancy choo choo train with this amt of rdway needs.
@mcgreevy99 Finally, a plan. Now for the details. Does it unduly rely on new gas taxes?
@kdeleon @Rendon63rd @JerryBrownGov @Jimbealljr If I hammer you for no plan, then I must compliment you for putting fwd a plan.
@DailyCaller Every time I see a picture of Kim I think of the Little Rascals with nuclear weapons. Existential threat.
@seanmdav @McCormackJohn The AG is too chicken to take this one on. :)
@brhodes Respectfully: go home. Write a book. You had your chance. It's over.  Don't make me list your fails. Just........go home.
@KFIAM640 If following the law is blackmail, then what is the charge for hiding your heritage and assuming an alias?
@thehill Did anyone run this past Preet Bharara? Asking for a friend.
@ChrisMegerian 1 vs 49: 1 loses, 49 take the money. Bad strategy.
@USChamber So how come local/state/federal govts are spending millions of dollars "taking care" of the homeless?
@The_RGA When will the national Democrats realize that the days of nominating old white re-tread candidates are over? Asking for a friend.
@kdeleon Sir: your analysis is damning. No diff from your decisions that have resulted in cuts to funding for maintain'g CA infrastructure.
@WestWingReport @MarketWatch Prices of many of these "assets" were hugely inflated - no one else wanted them. Total scam of taxpayer.
@WashTimes @realDonaldTrump @ckchumley Congressman Lieu is a great leader for Ds! Be loud! Be proud! Go Ted! :)
@latimes I know you have de infrastructure repair plan. I know you do. I know you do. Show us de infrastructure repair plan. Show us de plan
@kdeleon Where is de infrastructure repair plan you've been working on?
@thehill Respectfully: if the Ds think it was an act of war, then will Ds be submitting a congressional declaration of war? Ask'g 4 a friend
@FoxNews Still a jokester. 2020 awaits. I've heard 80 is the new 60. :)
@connortryan @DanaSchusterNYC Said no one ever: "I wish the news would report more on those Wieners." Leave them alone.
@kdeleon Now you can fund de infrastructure.
@thehill What do the Iranians have on Obama/Reid/Pelosi? Why didn't you speak up about stopping $150B giveaway?
@karenhanretty @keckery Now that is funny!
@kdeleon Can you tell us de names of de people involved?
@KCRAMax @kcranews Good coverage Max. Where's Gov Brown?
@cspan She hiLarryus. I wish she would speak Moe often. What a sCurlyus performance
@MattRexroad Or Rams fans. Or Lakers fans.
@cmarinucci @RepSpeier @CNN Too late. Supported Pelosi.
@DailyCaller Wow. I got nothing else. Just wow.
@KQED @KQEDnews What a coincidence! Isn't that about the cost of overruns on HSR?
@mikegatto Anywhere in California.
@carolynlochhead Gov Brown, come down from the mountaintop, walk among the people, and see the damage caused by the lack of infrastr maint.
@carolynlochhead Brown Doctrine: "This is an on-purpose lapse in infrastructure maint by people who don't know what the hell their job is."
@carolynlochhead Respectfully: "I came from CA to tell the truth about my fake infrastructure plan and instead build a choo choo train."
@latimes With respect: "I came from California to tell the truth about my fake infrastructure plan. I just want to build a choo choo train."
@FoxNewsInsider Leader of a parade of one.
@thehill Keep mocking him. A lot of charities need help.
@kylegriffin1 @MarcosBreton You mean like "It was caused by a video."?
@kdeleon @BayAreaCouncil Did the attendees discuss de cost of housing and what de Legislature is going to do about it?
Twice per year this is possible. No calls please; I have to get back to work now. https://t.co/qXsBnHZ95v
@kdeleon de park is done? Only 3 years? Great job!
@DailyCaller The only thing you regret is getting caught, which made plain your view that the rules don't apply to you. Sad epitaph.
@jaketapper Thank you for remembering him. Valuable book about the ugliness of war.
@TheFix You were re-elected.
@CapitolAlert Good morning Governor. 3 things to think about: infrastructure, in California, for Californians. You know: your current job.
@POLITICOMag If true, then why didn't former President Obama say that while in office and actually try to change it while he could?
@BernieSanders Show us leadership by renouncing your citizenship and moving to Venezuela. :)
@kcranews Good job, former President Obama. If ISIS is JV, is North Korea the freshman team? Another massive failure on your part.
@Amy_Chance @sacbee_news The Brown Doctrine: talk talk talk about roads/dams/etc, build silly choo choo train. Now trying to change subject.
@DailyCaller RexT: keep doing what you're doing. Use your skills. That's why President Trump hired you. Protect America's interests.
@hale_razor @erickbrockway This is clarity.
@kdeleon Frank de Gehry. Senator de Leon will explain it.
@politico Enough of the fancy pants silk table cloth dinners. Restore America's influence around world.
@MeetThePress Said no one in 2009: "We have to do something about this legislation that nobody read and got jammed down America's throat."
@Amy_Chance I wish he'd do something about infrastructure. The Brown Doctrine on infrastructure has failed.
@kdeleon I wonder how de people in your hometown react when they realize their leader is hiding his background. Why did you do this?
@LaCivitaC "Eet more chken"
@deanjnorris @JoeNBC Too bad this melarkey wasn't attacked by MSM then. Perhaps voters would have higher respect now for MSM if they had.
@KamalaHarris @anamariecox Some people run for office because they want to change things. Others run for office because it's the next rung.
@jaketapper Ask the President. He's in charge. Let RexT do what President Trump tells him to do. How RexT gets to goal is not public domain.
@thehill Good. I didn't vote for you. Process is boring. Do your business in private. Let Pres DT tell us about it. You work for him.
@POLITICOMag He doesn't care how you do it - the metric is whether it gets done. He hires people he has faith in and then lets them work.
@SouthernKeeks I wish all Irish were paid $500k like Pocahontas was.
@GovernorDavis Tho we disagree on some issues, you always behaved w/grace &amp; dignity befitting the office. I miss that in our officials.
@CaHSR_Scam Do you think the voters will pass more stuff for FART?
@kdeleon If de state wants de program, then de state pays for it. Ur in posit'n to do something. Pick: Choo choo train vs de other programs.
@kdeleon Those are de states' issues. If de states want them then de states can fund them. Just like de HSR choo choo train.
@kdeleon @nytimes Sir: de budget lays out de priorities. CA would benefit from de same approach setting priorities. Think of de infrastructr
@jaketapper Finally somebody states the obvious. Appeasement never works. The era of Rodney King diplomacy is over, hopefully. We'll see.
@CaHSR_Scam Seriously? FART?
@P_salmon The Brown Doctrine: talk talk talk about infrastructure, spend $ on unneeded train &amp; undergrnd periph'l canal. Competing w/father
@kdeleon Sir: Why did you claim for years to be Hispanic and for years deny your Asian heritage? Please post de answer. Very confusing.
@MattRexroad @RogerNiello Car drivers too!
@RogerNiello And park operators. :)
@DRUDGE_REPORT Bad Dogg!
@kdeleon Why are you worried about de Trumpcare when you don't even know your own name?
@RogerNiello Can you repeat that please? Also, ask Mary to move. She's blocking the light.
@paconner @DailyCaller Playing us like a puppetmaster. Shocking. Not.
@DailyCaller Ck Sen reimb reports. Taxpayers have been buying gas for decades for DC elitists. No wonder he doesn't care about oil supply.
@kdeleon @ThadKousser @UCSDnews @UofCalifornia What 's your real name? Why would you hide your heritage? Why would you fake your heritage?
@keckery @CBCNews Tell me when and I'll watch!
@mrctv @newsbusters Note the theme our major int'l competitors are attempting to perfect. How's it playing outside CONUS? This is important.
@ericawerner @scottwongDC "You don't agree with what we're doing? Let me read the bill and get back to you."
@bpolitics RexT makes politicos uneasy b/c he does important work behind closed doors and then reports on progress rather than process.
@jimgeraghty NO NO NO. She's great! Full of vision, passion, experience. Knows the real world. Great record of accomplishment. Ready to lead
@BBCWorld I love this!!!
@CBSNews "What do the Iranians have on Nancy Pelosi and fmr Pres ident Obama politically, financially, and personally?"
@Sammy_Roth @carolynlochhead Question being asked: why is the rest of the country paying for benefits that CA self-imposed?
@iandenisjohnson @feliciasonmez @HuffingtonPost This entire postulation is absolute wee wee.
@LouisFarrakhan Please reconcile: you vilify USA, yet display and enjoy the bounty of its system. Why should I take you seriously?
@jisterm @GrahamDavidA @nytimes Record revenues to state. Where's the $ being spent?
@jisterm @GrahamDavidA @nytimes Major govt question at every level: where to spend? Brown Doctrine is spend on HSR &amp; undergr periph canal.
@jisterm @GrahamDavidA @nytimes CA state revenue at all time high. CA state spending at all time high. Ask yourself: Where's the $ going?
@GrahamDavidA @nytimes Happening in CA too.  Called the Brown Doctrine: talk talk talk about roads/dams/levees, spend $ on HSR and peri canl
@cmarinucci @ccadelago @sacbee_news Print the whole quote: "This thing has been done in secret.......just like my infrastructure plan."
@MarcosBreton NO NO NO NO! Chelsea (not the soccer club) is a star! :)
@sacbee_news "This is a lot better than having to meet with legislators and come up with solutions."
@newsbusters I would probably flunk his class.
@johnmyers These q's are similar to the q's voters have on the Brown Doctrine re infrastructure: talk, talk, talk, build silly train &amp; PC.
@MSNBC I don't know where to begin regarding Congressman Ellison.
@Politics1com I would tell former President Obama that his term is up and that he should go home and write a book.
@VincentHarris @HarrisMedia And hired Michawn Rich!
@latimes Then Putin backed up and did it again, over and over and over. Former Pres Obama's strategic ambivalence was very damaging.
@ByronYork @washingtonpost Only one way to find out. Have a nice trip!
@DailyCaller Did you read it before you commented on it?
@intelwire @Politics1com @politico That's what hyenas do.
@FoxBusiness @FoxNewsInsider Why didn't you go to Wisconsin? If you'd done your job you'd be in WH. Instead you talk about this. Live/Learn.
@capitalpress Get a rope.
@KFIAM640 Owner of care was mooving to new apartment.
@FoxNewsInsider @HillaryClinton @RobbyMook @realDonaldTrump @ainsleyearhardt @kilmeade @SteveDoocy @foxandfriends Welcome to Wisconsin!
@thehill Has she read it?
@TocRadio @DailyCaller Has she read it?
@CurtisHouck @kjdrennen How about giving her some space? She has a right to try. Don't saddle her with mother's legacy.
@DavidMDrucker Too bad it's not........ACHOO
@GwilymMcGrew @SueCaro1 What was his involvement in Bell, CA?
@CNN More crocodile tears from another hyena.
@MMFlint ...and then The People, being ungrateful, said: Where's the jobs, food and future in socialism? Go figure.
@EWErickson @LubbockElitist This is contributing to a serious shortage of maple syrup.
@AmbassadorRice Hubris is unattractive. You and former Pres O empowered/enabled the Castro dictatorship. Your time is over. Go home.
@keckery Congrats on your appointment as a State Dept spokesman!
@PDChina Total, complete, absolute hog poop.
@NBA Palmed it. Travelled.
@thehill Given everything else happening today, that's nothing to get all twisted up over.
@stevebirr @DailyCaller Instead of asking DOJ to do the dirty work, why don't these Senators introduce legislation taking weed off list?
@AmbassadorRice Please go home. You're time is up. Don't make me list your failures. Just go home.
@ChuckGrassley Elizabeth Warren is in Iowa?
@NBCNews Lewis said it. Former Pres Obama hasn't said it. Lewis is expendable. You need to directly ask former Pres Obama. Jarrett dodged.
@SpillaneCa @CNN Russians are hyenas. Of course they laugh.
@KLewis44 @McCormackJohn Very carefully worded: "...any independent investigation...". If the WH ordered it, then it wasn't independent.
@TheFix Former Pres Obama hasn't said anything about the allegation. Only a spokesperson.
@ValerieJarrett It's a simple yes or no question: "Did you or did you not authorize surveillance on any U.S. citizen?"
@shearm This question needs to be asked directly of former President Obama and Valerie Jarrett.
@kdeleon If true Policy onus back on states. It will be interest'g to see if CA ldrs take ownership by pass'g legislat'n that is CA specific
@Publici @RiegerReport Progressive Ds need to investigate this. Hard to believe given the political rhetoric from D leadership/members.
@ChelseaClinton @tabberg @KellyannePolls I'm with CC on this. Richmond not credible.
@bpolitics Oh...I think we understand Red China very well. America no longer passive and Red China doesn't like that. Go figure.
@carolynlochhead @sfchronicle This puts the onus back on the states to "take care of their own". It will be int'g to see if states step up.
@MeetThePress @LindseyGrahamSC Jack Martha was a great American and an anchor for the Ds in the House. He is missed. RIP.
@singernews @Politics1com That's FUNNY! Laughing this hard this early is going to give me a stroke!
@singernews @Politics1com Lol. The incompetence would fit the eight year pattern.
@OKnox Someone needs to put President Obama and Valerie Jarrett on record on this matter.
@brhodes @anamariecox Sir: respectfully, I don't trust you.
@CAbobcat @nypost Children of successful people are often mocked. My dislike of Pres O policies does not extend to her. I hope she thrives.
@FoxNewsInsider @foxandfriends Money talks, BS stands. Go figure.
@CBSNews @CBSEveningNews Ask former President Obama why this happened. I'm curious why he allowed this.
@slone @latimes CA votes bigly for Clinton. CA hires Holder to fight Trump. CA budgets millions in legal aid for illegals. CA asks for what?
@ABCPolitics Red alert! Shields up! Jordy - I need more power!
@WashTimes Lol. Money talks, BS stands.
@FrankMankiewicz @lovethisnation_ @DailyCaller Standard practice both sides. I'm not your enemy here.
@FrankMankiewicz @lovethisnation_ @DailyCaller Standard practice all sides: pay for political travel w/campaign funds. Get salary regardless
@RepSpeier @KathiWindheim @ProPublica Ask Eric Holder.
@DailyCaller 22 times?!?!?!? Was this before or after Pres O told Putin he could be more flexible after the election?
@marcthiessen @cdelbeccaro President Obama's State Dept paid to send the Russian ambassador to Cleveland?????
@reidepstein @cmarinucci @WSJ So did every federal elected official who attended either convention. Some met w for ldrs within last year.
@brhodes @cmarinucci Question that needs to be answered: what did Pres O mean when he told Putin he could be more flexible after election?
@brhodes @cmarinucci Question that needs to be answered: why didn't Pres O do something when he was told about it?
@ByronYork @Pete4CA Senators are checks/balances. FoundgFthrs knew what they were doing. Get info from 3rd parties to assist understanding.
@CNNPolitics @CNN Correct. It has been underway for eight years.
@RedAlert You and me both......but that was decades ago. Just admit it. You'll feel better.
@TheOnion @murphymike Crocodile tears from a hyena.
@FrankLuntz @SueCaro1 Elitism at work, complicit with big govt advocates who need more $.
@colincampbell @CahnEmily @TheOnion Lol. Crocodile tears from a hyena.
@DailyCaller What do you mean "suggest otherwise"? This is a "yes I did" or "no I didn't" question. Give us a straight answer.
@capoliticalnews 1000s of immigr Eastern Europeans regularly go to Gibson Ranch. I talk to them. Have I lost my security clearance?
@brianbeutler @chrislhayes Amost as good as: "We have to pass it so we know what's in it."
@joncoupal So sad to watch but I'm glad she's the minority leader. Pelosi/Perez are R's worst nightmare. :)
@mkraju @KilloughCNN It's Twitter's fault you met with Russians?
@polNewsNetwork1 Who's the guy in the hoodie? :)
@bpolitics Not hard to understand. She represents NO ONE. RexT dealing with real countries/challenges.
@KathyTavoularis I'm not touching this one.
@CapitolAlert @sacbee_news If the train wreck of political strategy used by CA Dem ldrs re POTUS wasn't so sad, SNL would use it as parody.
@TovarRasputin @sacbee_news Classy photo.
@johnmyers @mcgreevy99 @JerryBrownGov What does GJB expect after his chest thumping bravado in Nov '16? The Brown Doctrine exposed.
@kdeleon Did Eric Holder advise you to say this? You need to fund street/highway repairs. Also, did you hear about Oroville? Big problem.
@DailyCaller Rahm: help yourself. Cancel your agreement governing policing tactics. The attorneys are literally killing your constituents.
@washingtonpost Free advice: think your positions thru. You will have to defend them. The campaign trail isn't a TV studio. Good luck!
@kfbk @49ers Cleveland.
@thehill No plan. Just insults. Regular Jane/Joe America know what they see. Hard to see these guys as the heirs to JFK or HST or Sam Nunn.
@daveweigel "You can keep your doctor"
@RobStutzman The Dems should have asked Eric Holder to do this.
@CapitolAlert @Rendon63rd Nat'l Dem FP: let anyone in, give them govt handouts, ignore the illegal behavior, blame the Republicans. Sad.
@kdeleon You did noth'g to stop such violence and crime. We see why you're embarrassed by POTUS remarks, focusing directly on your failures.
@kdeleon @POTUS @ICEgov @nytimes Is this something Eric Holder advised you to say? Do u think Feinstein/Harris/Becerra would recommend same?
@CaHSR_Scam @ocregister Where's Eric Holder? I thought he was going to solve this type of thing. Do you think his contract will be renewed?
@jurbanchuk If true, this speaks to who these protesters are.
@DailyCaller I want to help! The way this legal decision has been expanded is outrageous. Very destructive to economic development.
@MarcosBreton I like MB. I like his articles. I don't always agree with him. I hope he keeps writing. He adds value.
@RyanSabalow @sacbee_news The Brown Doctrine: $450 million on flood/water supply, $25,000 million on silly train. Go figure.
@DanielMorain @sacbee_news To summarize: "all is fine, existing programs working well, just need more taxes to do infrastructure." So wrong.
@FP1Strategies You guys should have won an Oscar in multiple categories. Great firm! Great people!
@bpolitics Memo to California: Step 1 - cancel HSR. Step 2 - cancel underground peripheral canal. Step 3 - cancel Holder. Call when done.
@WashTimes C'est magnifique! S'il vous plait! S'il vous plait! S'il vous plait!
@LaCivitaC That would be a major pay cut. :)
@business wont be many twitter responses because his name is too long :). If no one comments does he really exist?
@thehill Drain that swamp! It's about time. Listening to those morons makes one believe that some people have to think in order to breathe.
@DRUDGE_REPORT @YahooNews What? Two motorboats and a kayak? This is an attempt to provoke that merits no comment by WH other than "Really?".
@jaketapper Jake: he's not a Democrat. Maybe his view is paraphrase Will Rogers: "I wouldn't attend a party that invited me."
@DailyCaller The Brown Doctrine: No $ for infrastructure except HSR &amp; TT, cut $ for citizen benefits, hire Holder, blame Trump. Go figure.
@FOX40 S'il vous plait! S'il vous plait! S'il vous plait!
@FOX40 Lets call attention to things we don't need and can't afford: silly monuments like high speed rail &amp; an underground peripheral canal.
@DailyCaller If I move to Washington state will Gov sign exec order barring me from other fedl laws like income taxes? Please say YES!
@WaltersBee @JerryBrownGov Some things never change. The Brown Doctrine: talk talk talk about infrastructure, build silly legacy monuments.
@CapitolAlert Talk is cheap. Construction isn't. So far the Brown Doctrine has been all talk except for silly legacy projects like HSR &amp; TT.
@LaCivitaC @USMC Thank you for your service. Glad you made it home.
@DailyCaller Governor - you are better than this kind of rhetoric.
@sami_gallegos Sir: please propose your plan.
@johnmyers @JerryBrownGov The Brown Doctrine: talk talk talk about infrastructure, spend money building useless legacy monuments. Go figure.
@ABCWorldNews This is what real world experience sounds like.
@KamalaHarris Yo! If you are going to selectively enforce federal laws, can we start with the Internal Revenue Code? More tax = fewer jobs.
@SacramentoKings Let the horses run! Pass the ball! Play some D! Support your teammate! Repeat!
@MBuffington Too early to say "Addition by subtraction". Need a few games to evaluate. Looks good tho. Seems players are having fun!
@FoxNews @FoxNewsInsider Do I have to pay federal taxes anymore?
@FoxNewsInsider @DanMalloyCT Do I have to pay federal taxes anymore?
@SpeakerBoehner @michaelscherer Mr. Speaker: my lawn needs cutting. You're always welcome in Sacramento.
@DailyCaller She is formidable. The Ds are lucky to have her.  Keith Ellison will be a great political partner for her.
@POLITICOMag Traditional politicians love the camera. Successful business people let their work speak for itself. RexT not a politician.
@POLITICOMag If ur standard to evaluate Tillerson is Kerry and Clinton, then u should recalibrate. Tillerson is The Quiet Man. Watch &amp; learn
@guypbenson and then Congress exempted itself from the mandate.
@mindyfinn Speaker Nancy Pelosi
@RogerNiello I did 600 town halls in six years. Each time was highly informative in helping me represent my district. Great experience!
@RogerNiello I second your nomination as Chairman!
@RepBera @NASA Notwithstanding our past, you should go see your Dad. He's your Dad.
@ChrisMegerian Voted for Obama
@KFIAM640 What statute authorizing early release was the prevailing statute that caused this prisoner's release? Was there any discretion?
@YahooFinance @slone A wild moos chase?
@AaronBlake @washingtonpost "It's all Bush's fault!"
@YamsTV I miss the cow already!
@SMetter26 Looks like a BBQ to me! Two all beef patties, special sauce, lettuce,  cheese,.........
@CahnEmily Then don't think about it. I'm still your friend. "Eat more chikn". :)
@kenjbarnes1 @CHPPlacerville This is result of "the Brown Doctrine": talk about infrastructure, spend money on legacy monuments.
@pbump Lol! That is funny!
@CahnEmily Do you eat meat?
@BraddJaffy @thegarance BBQ starts now!
@jordanndavis @stephaniegenco City folk playing cowboy. Where's Billy Chrystal? BBQ ribs for lunch?
@ABC10 What was the statutory obligation that led to the parole of this person?
@TheFix Ask Mr Podesta: Why didn't Pres O do something when he learned about the Russian involvement in our election?
@WaterDeeply @CapRadioQuinton @CA_DWR @JCS_UCS @UCSUSA How climate change caused the concrete spillway to fail. 3. 2. 1. Discuss.
@POLITICOMag Just as they did under President Obama. Now we have to clean it up.
@jeffrandle I concur. Consider the Boston game.
@CBSNews Nice suit Robby. You had "the best candidate and all the money". How'd you lose? Why didn't Pres O do something about Russians?
@waltgray916 @ABC10 Can someone tell me how the Kings did when they last played Boston?
@MarcosBreton Lol.
@CNNPolitics This will never happen. These so called progressives don't know how to work in primaries. And they live in fear of Estab Dems.
@thehill This is not news. The mistake was immediately apparent to all who weren't inside the President's bubble. And our enemies acted.
@business Duh.
@POLITICOMag The world is a dangerous place. Continuing with policies of last 8 years would be dangerous. How do you know Trump has no plan?
@MarketWatch Define "robot".
@bpolitics The days where China used NK to harass USA hopefully are over. POTUS setting new "rules".  China doesn't know what to expect.
@NBCNews @mitchellreports Ma'am: much of what you did was offensive. You had your turn. Go home. Write a book. Don't make me list your fails
@PoliticsNation @NBCNews You had your turn. Much of what you did was offensive. Go home. Write a book. Don't make me list your mistakes.
@CNN IMHO If anyone knows collusion it would be her.
@kdeleon @hickforco @ilike_mike Did he hire Eric Holder, too?
@keckery You are better than this.
@kdeleon @FoLARtweets Where's Eric Holder? What is your strategery for dealing with CA's infrastructure? Running for US Senate?
@KCBSNews @CBSSF Where's Eric Holder?
@KCRALuery Mike - I meant to send this to Lt Gov Newsom. Please accept my apology. I know this isn't in your purview.
@KCRALuery Sir: did you use your position to advocate for funding for the Oroville Dam spillway, or did you opt to give Eric Holder $75k?
@kdeleon @democracynow Why didn't you fund the repairs to Oroville that were identified in 2013 report by DWR?
@ChelseaClinton I refuse to argue with kids who defend their parents. Rule does not apply to parents. These issues were litigated. HRC 0-2.
@Cernovich @jk_rowling Senator Sanders owns three houses. Ask him too.
@CA_DWR @richardcostigan @CALFIRE_ButteCo Gibson Ranch in northern Sacto County can accommodate 25 horses and RVs/campers/tents 916-806-3110
@AmyLewisKFBK yes
@AmyLewisKFBK ok. You call me.
@AmyLewisKFBK probably. Depends on what happens. If crowd comes to Gibson Ranch I will be there managing chaos. What time?
@AmyLewisKFBK if you have RV or fifth wheel we have space for you at Gibson Ranch. Contact Doug 916-806-3110 or Stephanie 916-201-7874.
@AmyLewisKFBK Gibson Ranch has space for 25 horses. Available now. Contact Nick 707-623-7665 or Doug 916-806-3110
@DailyCaller Calling Eric Holder!  Please report to the Governor's office. We lack funds to repair damage but your $75k is safe.
@latimes Where's Eric Holder? Is this his idea? What a great strategy! "ITS ALL PRESIDENT TRUMP'S RESPONSIBILITY!"
@BeLikeNee @shearm @POTUS President Obama should have tried it. It's the simple things that make a difference.
@shearm @POTUS Hmmm. China's leader asked leader of US to do something. I bet the leader of US asks for something in return.  Smart move.
@ABCPolitics When this goes to SCOTUS and is remanded on a 4-4 vote, do you think the Senate Ds get blamed if a terrorist attack occurs?
@EffieYeawNC @MoniNews Gibson Ranch is still open. Come on out and enjoy the rain!
@ChadPergram Gibberish.
@kdeleon @GinaEPA @YouTube Is your federal campaign account open yet?
@kcraBrianHickey Gibson Ranch is open and the bathrooms are clean and accessible. :)
@DRUDGE_REPORT Fools.
@MarcosBreton @Nordstrom And you look fabulous!
@ABCPolitics @NancyPelosi What on earth do the Iranians have on you and former President Obama that compels you to give them $150 billion?
@axios @Politics1com Leave him alone. Sometimes things don't work out.
@CapitolAlert @sacbee_news Does Assemblyman Stone own the "tether" patent? Nanny government out of control.
@RobStutzman According to the pricing schedule attached to contract, smugness costs $25,000 per month, minimum term three months.
@CapitolAlert @sacbee_news The revolving door: in the Govt,out of Govt,in the Govt,out of Govt. Great work if u can get it. DRAIN THE SWAMP!
@davidsiders What nonsense. Why does de Leon think Feinstein/Harris can't handle protecting CA's interests?
@MarcosBreton MB - you're wasting your time. Her campaign was about self-enrichment, not change for the better. Ignore her.
@LATpoliticsCA @latimes Tread carefully. 8 USC 1324 appears to be controlling statute.
@allisonwisk @johnmyers @mcgreevy99 @latimes Tread carefully.  8 USC 1324 appears to be the controlling statute.
@CBSSacramento @cbslocal If u want to control fed'l $ then run for fed'l office. 49 states want CA tax $ and their MCs will vote to take.
@ReutersPolitics In the real world, that means it was a message specifically for President Trump.
@maggieNYT @HotlineJosh @Reuters One can only hope Putin files suit. Imagine the cross examination.
@thehill Can you imagine the cross examination in court?
@RedState Bigger than Teapot Dome. Includes bankers getting above mkt interest payments with no risk and teachers' salaries tapping Treasury
@thehill Glass houses. Stones. It would be interesting.
@CNN @politicoroger I listened to your whole statement. I wish you well in retirement.
@MeetThePress I want to know what the Iranians have on you and Former President Obama.
@POLITICOMag Dear Mr. Mayor: Don't punish suburbs and rural areas with bad immigration enforcement because you want to please your base.
@MattRexroad @sacbee_news If JG runs again he should expect a primary challenge from the left. Challenger probably wins primary here and CD7
@SMetter26 Where's Eric Holder?
@CNN Politics is a tough business. There's always sniper  fire on the tarmac.
@GavinNewsom @cmarinucci Sir: take the President's concerns seriously. Lots of fedl $ at stake. Rest of country hopes CA remains refusenik.
@ChadPergram Just like the Iranians.
@ChadPergram Our leaders should be most concerned about what the Iranians have on the launch pad, and Muttonhead in Pyongyang. Existential.
@ChadPergram Almost as staggering as Mrs. Pelosi doing nothing on $150 billion to Iran.
@elizabeth_joh @pamelawu He's speaking to UC's leadership. Based on actions since 1/20/17, they shld listen. Or perhaps get $ elsewhere.
@DailyCaller Where's the remaining $1,700,000?
@brhodes @thegarance Mr Rhodes: respectfully, you had your chance. Don't make me list ur errors. Go home. Write a book. Ur tenure is over.
@brhodes @jaketapper You had your chance. Don't make me list your mistakes. Go home. Write a book. Your tenure is over.
@MattRexroad @CouncilwomanMoy @POTUS BTW why did you delete the word "previous" from in front of the word "POTUS"? I'm still your friend.
@MattRexroad @CouncilwomanMoy @POTUS What's your plan?
@ccadelago @XavierBecerra Has anyone seen Eric Holder? This seems tailor made for him, given the rationale for his contract?
@MattRexroad What's your plan?
@ccadelago @kron4news Where's Eric Holder?
@MattRexroad I am a Republican and your friend. I know you don't support obama's passive approach. What is your plan?
@evanhalper It's coming.
@yourpappalardo @nsilverberg (Your comment on the Swear Police was funny.) Thank you for sharing your unremarkable rhetorical flourishes.
@yourpappalardo @nsilverberg Lol!
@MitchDJohnston @nsilverberg Ask Nicole.
@MitchDJohnston @Geoff_Mackler @nsilverberg I dislike it when people who should have sufficient command of English resort to swearing.
@MitchDJohnston @nsilverberg I would tell them that they should by now have sufficient control of English language so as to not swear.
@Geoff_Mackler @nsilverberg I hate autocorrect.
@nsilverberg actually Nicole: you're command of the English language is unimpressive.......and you're an idiot.
@nsilverberg Nicole: you're an idiot.
@carolynlochhead @Eric_Garcetti @sfchronicle You can buy whatever u want. If u pay $50k for something u can get for $30k then less for parks
@CaHSR_Scam @ClintOlivier I'm still at home waiting to be arrested. Shall I call AI?
@kcranews How come AG Becerra  didn't fix these immigration issues when in Congress? Ds controlled all of fed Govt 2006-2010.
@CaHSR_Scam I don't know what those words mean. Do I need a safe space?
@CaHSR_Scam @KamalaHarris Calling Eric Holder. Please report to Senator de Leon. Urgent. Lol.
@CaHSR_Scam @KamalaHarris I'm at home. Come arrest me. :)
@CaHSR_Scam @KamalaHarris This is an absurd assertion.
@ElmetsPR @YouTube In 2016 she fashioned a winning campaign vs HRC campaign which was a joke. HRC now singing the blues. :)
@BreitbartNews @CAbobcat I have called all my D friends and asked them to support her. She and Pelosi would be formidable. NOT!
@LBJ1941 @HotlineJosh Lol! Hilarious!
@CapitolAlert @CA_DaveJones !!!!Where is Eric Holder??????
@rocza @roseveleth @guardian Border Patrol well within its authority. Study harder.
@rocza @roseveleth @guardian That's called: enforcing the law.
@PoliticsReid @sacbee_news But but but but.......where's Eric Holder? Hiring him was/is total nonsense.
@DRUDGE_REPORT @TheSun Is President Obama ignoring this just as he did Putin's apparent efforts to undermine HRC? He's President until noon.
@latimes Wow! A President actually enforcing the law, just like the Constitution says the President is supposed to do. Who'd of thunk that?
@CapitolAlert @sacbee_news Where's Eric Holder? I thought he was hired to make sure this type of thing doesn't happen.
@sacbee_news I thought this is why they hired Holder! Still find it odd that Legislature thinks Holder better than Feinstein/Pelosi/Becerra.
@NBCNewsPR @MeetThePress @SenFeinstein I concur with Sen Feinstein. Who is responsible for monitoring/preventing over the past few years?
@politico Lol. And entire country, both sides of the aisle, are stunned by your lack of understanding of how to win a presidential election.
@nprpolitics @NPR Where has Sen Cardin been for past eight years?
@McClatchyDC Wrong. You know the law. Federal law supreme. Pot is not legal. Quit lying......wait. Maybe you don't know the law. Sad
@POLITICOMag It has never been legal. BASIC constitutional canon: federal law overrules state law. Otherwise, states could nullify taxes.
@GlennThrush President Obama and working class American.
@thehill This equals about 3.5% of US population. Did  nat'l Ds implement a policy that benefits 3.5% and adversely impacts 96.5%? Sad.
@DailyCaller Pres Bush is a gentleman. He wouldn't go with you. You'd throw a fit. USSS would intervene. You'd go to jail. Please proceed.
@Amy_Chance @sacbee_news Wrong. Pot not legal. Federal law prevails over state law. This is BASIC constitutional law. You know this.
@TIMEPolitics @mahitagajanan @TIME Turn the volume to zero? Better yet, turn the volume to zero and read Alice in Wonderland as a parody.
@nytimesworld Pay attention. Trrsts changing tactics: kill/injure civilians, drain Govt $, slow economy down, avoid military. Trouble ahead.
@slone Too tempting: naive/experienced, passive/assertive, dumb/smart, drops the ball/gets things done. Your turn......
@slone @dcexaminer 1 pm tee time got in the way of "showing up". Consistent with behavior of last 8 years: never showed up.
@marcorubio @SenRubioPress Trrsts changing tactics: randomly kill/injure civilians, drain govt $, slow economy down, avoid military.
@WashTimes Only possible conclusion by Senator de Leon: Apparently Feinstein/Pelosi/Becerra are not up to the task.
@AlBoeNEWS @SMetter26 Good! Sooner he's dead the better.
@lfangonilo Which eyebrow did you shave off? :)
@StupidVetTricks @SenSanders Please take your meds.
@StupidVetTricks @SenSanders I thought your doctor advised you to keep using the meds. You should listen to your doctor. So sad.
@CNN @CNNPolitics This is what you get when America's top diplomat channels Rodney King. Sad.
@HotlineJosh Kerry making the case that Israel should grant citizenship to the refugees in Gaza and Jordan. Then be overwhelmed at election.
@JoeNBC "Strategic ambivalence". What a joke. Think about the playground bully taking your lunch money. You surrender and call it strategic.
@AP_Politics You didn't vote!!! Are our values now characterized as ambivalent? This must be so embarrassing for you.
@scottlay Must be the Comedy Show.
@CNN Shall we call this a theoretical term of office? Or just a theoretical Presidency? So many apps of the word "theoretical" to POTUS.
@SenSanders How many houses do you own? How much did you pay for them? You're a 1%er. Merry Christmas!
@FaceTheNation No, he'll send Dennis Rodman. :)
@CBSNews And when you get there and ignore common sense and your own WH experts, you get 8 years of incompetence. Leadership matters!
@SenSanders @Politics1com Does Senator Sanders still own 3 houses? Which one does he live in? Looks and feels like he's a 1%er.
@CapitolAlert @sacbee_news Of course they would. But that's not how the system works. Be careful what you wish for.
@Peggynoonannyc Future former President Obama will fit right in.
@Peggynoonannyc Is this where President Obama will be post 1/20/17? Seems like a good fit per your description. :)
@newsbusters What did President Obama know and when did he know it and why didn't he do something to prevent it? I miss Sam Ervin.
@stinkingflower @politico @realDonaldTrump Your logic is totally flawed based on WH statements.
@thehill Did the WH tell the Trump campaign? WH knew about it 60 days ago and did nothing. POTUS supposed to protect elections. You failed!
@politico @realDonaldTrump WH knew 60 days ago and did nothing. That's not a joke! That's incompetence! You knew and did nothing!!!!!
@USATODAY You're 60 days too late. You knew and did nothing. Another Red Line, this time with false bravado. Sad ending.
@businessinsider Sixty days too late!  This is hilarious! ROFLMAO.
@politico @POTUS @ludacristiano ROFLMAO! Another Red Line? The President should quit his day job and go into comedy.
@CNN This is too funny! It's like The Three Stooges where the President plays all three characters. Is this another Red Line? ROFLMAO!
@thehill Is this another GJB legacy project?
@LaCivitaC Nice sweater!
@bpolitics Time will tell who is a better chess player: Kissinger, a known geopolitical master, or Trump, a known deal master.
@TomSteyer @joegarofoli @sfchronicle Last time we heard from you was about income inequality. Are u still working on that or did u move on?
@JoanOfSnark @PostOpinions @SenTedCruz @tedcruz @RepDeSantis Can you direct me to your info source re these lifetime pensions? Thx.
@DanielMorain @johnmyers Best showing for a losing Pres candidate in California since ever. Way to go HRC!
@MarcosBreton @YeaYouRite What happened to cloture rqmt on SCOTUS noms? Nuke option only applies lwr fedl crts, as I understand Reid's move.
@MarkLandler @shearm Please ask the senior admin official: Who called? How many is several?
@BreitbartNews Poor logic here. Is it racist to say you will help a minority community or is it racist to ignore a minority community?
@thehill 50 days left in an 8 year term. Why didn't he push legislation earlier? This is so bogus.
@slone @pnmoore4116 @politico This is spot on by slone. Of course, Team Clinton isn't involved...NOT!
@RepFredUpton good job Fred!
@PaulBlu @rebeccaballhaus Fincl conflicts rising. Can fix by Congress passg legis req'g tax exempt lqdatn of all hldgs for PEOTUS/Cab/SES.
@ElmetsPR @realDonaldTrump @HillaryClinton @politico HRC team played hide &amp; seek instead of chess. Inability to count EC votes fatal.
@businessinsider I will read this later.
@DailyCaller Senator Reid as a newspaper columnist is a perfect metaphor for the industry as a whole.
@FrankLuntz @slone Frank is precisely on point here.
@kdeleon I respectfully ask that you partner w/fedl govt regarding the problems facing CA: roads, schools, water, etc.. Higher prob success
@philwillon @latimes Who's paying the bills?
@EricBoehlert @chrislhayes No. they'd be saying how stupid he is, that this is typical of rookie candidates to not know rules, served him right. Somebody call DNC.
@tabberg @debrajsaunders @politico Wrong.
@politico @NancyPelosi Speaking as a Republican, this is great news!
@politico Jeb Bush and his family are remarkable Americans. They have been and remain valuable contributors. I look forw'd to working with them again.
@DrDavidDuke Wrong. Julian Asante should stay in that embassy or risk being arrested and deported back to USA.
@CNNPolitics If you play by the rules then our institutions say Trump won. Are you suggesting the rules should not be complied with?
@TIMEPolitics @CharlotteAlter @TIME That is a complete misread of what just happened.
@RobStutzman I'm still your friend.
@weknowwhatsbest @pnjaban What? No, that is not the standard. You are a fool.
@jaketapper This is just DELUSIONAL! Ds will never take back House majority as long as Mrs. Pelosi is their leader.
@mkraju @deirdrewalshcnn This is delusional. The Ds were never going to take the House back. As long as Mrs. Pelosi leads the Ds, the House stays Republican.
@JoeNBC It's still early Joe. Really early.
@MichawnRich @Ted_Strickland The word for Strickland's campaign is: Faceplant.
@politico Then Chelsea's husband traded Greek bonds using this info. That's highly profitable but definitely illegal.
@Cernovich @Wagsfam2 There it is!!!!!!! Where's Mary Jo White?
@CBSNews Imagine having a president who thinks 99% of Americans are deplorable or irredeemable or live in the basement by choice. Her words.
@AHMalcolm Simply not possible.
@capoliticalnews Any appointment is subject to advise and consent of the Senate, which is discretionary act per the Constitution. It's called check/balance.
@finneganLAT John - you are better than this.
@businessinsider @BI_contributors When we sent $150 bn to Iran, the ability to influence Iranian behavior by raising oil prod'n was seriously compromised. BHO failed again.
@DailyCaller Hillary Clinton has normalized illegal behavior.
@joshtpm @voxdotcom Time will tell us if you are right. And I don't mean the magazine.
@thehill Why shouldn't he? He's going to pardon Ami Bera's dad too.
@FOX40 Will Clinton accept the results of the election?  I can't believe she would choose this route. We've always had peaceful transition of power
@postpolitics @washingtonpost Does Pres Obama watch these shows? I guess there's nothing else for him to do.
@guypbenson @BretBaier @townhallcom If Weiner laptop recd classified material then FBI should examine whether Weiner laptop was hacked by outside interests.
@NBCNightlyNews She doesn't make honest  mistakes. Everything is calculated. The voters see that. Why don't you? Either you or she ruined foreign policy.
@NateSilver538 How does the likely overwhelming pro-HRC vote in CA/NY/Illinois skew the model, if at all?
@MylesMill @nytimes Is this what is known as "the Clinton Flu" where her close confidantes take a beating but she skates away?
@TIMEPolitics @JillFilipovic @TIME No q HRC made questionable choices with her spouse. She should have slapped him silly in public. Instead, she chose power over behavior.
@JeffreyToobin Who's Loretta Lynch?
@karentravers @ABC @LangerResearch This poll uses a sample that contacts 33% more Dems than Reps. No wonder HRC is +2.
@thehill Dear Secretary Clinton: Huma has copies of any emails in question. Ask her. Have a great day!
@ReutersPolitics @Reuters Did Huma rant in an email to her husband about something Clinton did? I wonder if the content of rant matched prior FBI interview details.
@keckery DC elitism is bad for everyone. Never tire of pointing out double stds. Thanks for the compliment re my hair :). POTUS not on my bucket list
@keckery No.The worst thing about the latest HRC email story is...that she continues to not be held accountable due to double standard for DC elites.
@thehill American voters in state of anger and disbelief over.....double standard law enforcement.
@usatoday2016 @USATODAY We were after that months ago but all you did was lie, bob and weave. You brought this on yourself. It's not a vast FBI conspiracy.
@mitchellreports @realDonaldTrump This is not about Comey. Nice try though.
@MichawnRich @robportman @Ted_Strickland This is basic. Portman talked about what he has done. Then he talked about what Strickland hadn't done. The voters listened. Game over.
@MichawnRich @rollcall @robportman Portman has the right message: focused, compassionate, clear.
@tatecurtis She could retire and let the others see if 7 is collegial.
@ccadelago @sacbee_news Stop the presses! Clinton leads in NY, Illinois, Massachusetts, Oregon by large numbers. Stunning news! Not!
@johnmyers @PPICnotes Lol. What a stunner! Not! John - this is not news. However, it does explain Clinton's lead in these various national polls.
@RobStutzman Pajamaman!  You're the newest superhero! Great disguise.
@businessinsider Who are US Senators from New Jersey? Have they made same request?
@MichawnRich He should significantly increase what he pays his media person. Whoever she is, she will be in demand in 2018! Hire her now!
@LegInsurrection @COCOGOP @nypost Wow! If true it's deja by all over again. Maybe she was "flat broke" when she quit State Dept.
@CBSNews @timkaine @FaceTheNation Which ones aren't accurate?
@mkraju @CNNSotu This is delusional.
@MeetThePress This is so naive.
@Reuters It's about time!
@CameraGuyDave1 @CBSSacramento @GoodDaySac @GoodDayTraffic Folsom doesn't go north south. Do you mean southbound Watt?
@davidfrum @Politics1com 1992 Clinton 43%
@ABCPolitics Not if Trump wins and the Rs hold either the House or the Senate or both.
@ccadelago @CNN One word: delusional.
@hobnobfolsom Great game! Do it again!
@madrid_mike I hope the Giants win.
@ElmetsPR @SpeakerRyan @realDonaldTrump @politico Doug Elmets should do the right thing and revoke his endorsement of Hillary Clinton.
@wmarone @SenSanders You are clearly embarrassed. Your guy is a 1%er. You know it. I know it. Puts the lie to your philosophy.
@wmarone @SenSanders which part makes you mad: 1) he has 3 homes; or 2) he doesn't pay his share; or 3) you knew and still fell for it?
@wmarone @SenSanders He owns THREE houses. There's no way to do that except by not paying his fair share. You knew that when he was running.
@wmarone @SenSanders He's not paying his fair share. He has three houses. Price of latest house $600k+. Lots of empty bedrooms. Go figure.
@SenSanders You should lead by example. Which of those houses are you going to sell first?
@Jennie_Cake1 @RantsOutloud Your analysis is very poorly informed.
@Jennie_Cake1 @RantsOutloud Say hello to Mrs. Clinton when you see her.
@Jennie_Cake1 @RantsOutloud Your analysis is terribly uninformed.
@Jennie_Cake1 Are you still feeling good about supporting Crooked Hillary?
@FreeBeacon @SenTedCruz @Kredo0 Serious Question: how does a "secret agreement" get enforced?
@AndrewHClark Not enough response choices.
@ElmetsPR @realDonaldTrump @nytimes Not likely. BTW-when can I get a tour of the Ivory Tower? Is writing for an editorial page a real job?
@mikememoli beat the Cubs! Go Giants!
@FoxNews @AriFleischer I don't want them on my side. I want them  out of my affairs. They have no clue. They kill jobs and enthusiasm.
@soapyfosty Go Giants!
@thehill No. That would be a choice between Carter and Obama, as history is showing. Interesting how they both got played by Iran.
@HotlineJosh @ShaneGoldmacher Not no more!  Go Giants!
@MarcosBreton @realDonaldTrump Move. Countermove. Rest of world put on notice: go ahead - make your move. America on the way back! Go Trump!
@MarcosBreton Nunes to the rescue! Go G-Men!
@ElmetsPR @HillaryClinton @realDonaldTrump @DMRegister Iowa farmers will not be duped by more DC elite deplorable trade deals. #NeverClinton
@samsteinhp So HRC and campaign staff had communicable pneumonia in public? Who was infected? Is public now sick? Hope they all recover.
@JoeNBC @BeschlossDC Hey Hey it's the...........Enterprise!
@politico @playbookplus @NancyPelosi Delusional. Even HRC has thrown you under the bus.
@madeleine @StarTrek Now that is a great picture!
@politico 'outright wacky': red line, Asia pivot, Russian reset, not ransom, empty Gitmo, Arab Spring, DACA, Benghazi. Just to name a few.
@Timodc Good tweet!  Nice to hear from you! We've missed you!
@pnjaban @ccadelago @RepBera Ask yourself: who benefitted from this scam? Then ask yourself: who's being held accountable? Disgraceful.
@anitakumar01 @HillaryClinton Please keep implying that those of us in private for-profit businesses are somehow breaking the law.
@business Nice watch, Howard.
@WSJPolitics WOW! Clinton is trying to throw Powell under the bus and he's having none of it! This will be interesting to watch.
@ConservativeZNJ @CookieOcean @nypost WAIT A MINUTE! She was the editor?????
@business And if it ever looks like she can win in LA she will be there in a flash. Otherwise..."You're on your own."
@placergop Weak line of attack. These towns are on different ISLANDS. Better ammo elsewhere: Clinton Found., Asia pivot, Arab Spring, etc.
@thehill Can you say "public figure"? AW has no income so he's laying the groundwork to sue someone. What a joke!
@Montel_Williams @abnheel It will be interesting to see whether Secretary Powell weighs in. That would be breaking news!
@BernieSanders @joegarofoli Don't preach to me about income inequality. You just bought a 600k THIRD home. How much time do you spend there?
@Paradox13VA @Josh_Richman Worthless analysis. Olympians prove success comes from private effort. Did the Obama Admin create these athletes?
@CNNPolitics Are they hiring? Probably the most important job in America today: prevent another four years of the Obama disaster.
@HistoricalPics @michaelscherer This is an awesome athlete! As I watched I couldn't help but think of Clinton's explanations re emails.
@ElmetsPR The emails come w/territory. All in public eye get them.  It's not a Trump phenomenon.
@Jennie_Cake1 I respect that you prefer Clinton to Trump, but I don't understand it. Have a great day!
@Jennie_Cake1 Clinton has been and would be a train wreck. I appreciate your support for beating her.
@KThomasDC @jpaceDC ROFLMAO. How in the world would Obama know who is fit and who isn't fit? 7+ years of abject failure now he's an expert.
@POLITICOMag What a fun game: "If (Trump) wins, I strongly suspect it will be because of everything we have absolutely no clue about."
@Timodc @mindyfinn    Yo Tim! When we were working on Gov Bush's campaign you didn't call me a patsie. U r my friend but disappointed in you
@politico I seriously doubt that Gov Bush will be endorsing anyone advocating for legalizing drugs.
@RobStutzman U r my friend. I know you. We each pick: who's best for America? Not voting no option. We can win. Come home. Door is open.
@FoxBusiness @KenCuccinelli @realDonaldTrump @HillaryClinton If so, please talk to @dougelmets to do the same. Make America Great Again!
@KCRALuery Just spoke with Edie Lambert. She's getting access to everyone! Keep up the good work!
@elizabethcrisp @jaketapper @POTUS @LouisianaGov @theadvocatebr Where's HRC? Where's HRC?	Where's HRC?
@markknoller Re: Baton Rouge. Where's HRC? Where's HRC? Where's HRC?
@markknoller Why hasn't HRC issued a statement re Baton Rouge? Unable to make a decision?
@MajorCBS @POTUS Speaking of Baton Rouge: Where is HRC?
@AirForceTimes @MilitaryTimes Isn't he an American citizen?
@Conflicts @COCOGOP @suleymansoylu @140journos Can't be accurate - President Obama is playing golf.
@rjsmithcpi @thegarance @erin_rq Shocking since South  Sudan described as an Obama/Clinton success story. Time for new U.S. leadership!
@cmarinucci @Publici @erin_rq a South Sudan a prime example of the Obama/Clinton foreign policy success story. Time for new leadership!
@thehill I'm studying gibberish so I can better understand what Rachel says.
@jbarro @AaronBlake   Now that is funny!
@DailyCaller No! How can this be? Is this in addition to being duped by the Chinese, Iranians, Pakistanis, Muslim Brotherhood, etc.?
@thehill Delusional.
@businessinsider @TheFiscalTimes Another Obama/Clinton success story. Under their leadership the top American export has been failure.
@thehill When asked to be delegate I knew expectation. Those who "found their conscience" after being appointed need to stop playing games.
@thehill Good job keeping politics out of SCOTUS. We will miss you.
@thehill "It's not my fault". Sad.
@thehill Its always somebody else's fault. Sad.
@washingtonpost @maxbearak Another Obama/Clinton success story.
@thehill Even her staunchest supporters  like Perez know better than to trust her. Sad.
@CNNPolitics Did anyone check with Ditector Comey before taking this to a grand jury!
@KCRALeticia I didn't know that Wilton tribe had tribal lands located in Elk Grove at Hwy 99 and Kammerer Road. How fortunate for them!
@MarcosBreton Bad throw on preceding play very costly. Come on Giants!
@businessinsider Your State Dept id'd Iran as a state sponsor of terrorism. You supported giving Iran $150 bn. What part of asinine is that?
@maggieNYT @PatrickRuffini Clinton supporting $150 bn gift to Iran, who has promised to eradicate Israel and attack the Great Satan.
@ElmetsPR @SFGate You're voting for her?I know you. Her performance/policies/lying are the exact opposite of who you are. I'm very confuzd
@Forbes Then the remaining 91% will probably vote for Clinton again. She really should run for president of the United States of Europe.
@DRUDGE_REPORT What part of asinine applies here? Giving $150 bn to Iran, which Clinton supported &amp; worked to implement, was anti-Semitic.
@realDonaldTrump @pnjaban Perfect  example of how DC elitists rig the system so they benefit and the Silent Majority loses. No more! Vote!
@realmattyvegas @thehill Hi Matt. Why is HRC running for president? What is she proposing to do? Happy 4th!
@thehill Her rationale is "It's my turn". Running on her record is a loser. Gender isn't enough. Policy proposals flawed. Voters know it.
@ElmetsPR Reminds me of when the DC Democrats made Sen Byrd, former KKK Grand Wizard, pro tem of US Senate, 4th in line for the presidency.
@MarkFinan Another day begins at Gibson Ranch! https://t.co/T8VRncQWgr
@FlashReport Jon - I've always thought you were a better writer than this. This type of invective is unworthy of you.
@RonNehring @realDonaldTrump Hi Ron Who are u supporting for President? Hope u join Team Trump and help take our country in a new direction!
@TheFix Isn't he the guy that pushed for bailing out Wall St in 2008? Former CEO of Goldman Sachs? Another DC elitist for the status quo.
@latimes President Obama didn't have the financial ability to do this when he was elected in 2008. How is he able to do it now?
@AG_Conservative @COCOGOP @seanmdav I concur. HRC track record is abysmal.
@Peggynoonannyc @ByronYork "Back of the queue" consistent w/other failures of President Obama's foreign policy. HRC promises more of same.
@jlfeder This is a profound observation. Leadership matters. Thank you for sharing.
@StuPolitics @kelsey_snell This sit-in stunt is designed to keep MSM from reporting on Trumps detailed expose' of Clinton's corruption.
@RepBecerra  After waves of immigrants undermine Europe, Obama/Clinton refuse any responsibility for Arab Spring failure. Good job X! Not!
@politico @VP Compared to the past seven years? You have FAILED across the board and around the world. You're an elitist. Go home!
@fritzco64 im not a candidate for office. DC elites such as HRC have squandered standing and prosperity of USA. Time to change direction.
@fritzco64 Double check your assertion. Your premise is wrong. :)
@kcranews The goal is to change the direction our country is going. Trump offers that opportunity; Clinton does not. Stop playing games.
@nytimes Aplicant must be: able to lie with impunity, able to raise millions from overseas non citizens, convinced DC has all the answers.
@CNNPolitics My daughters say you have access to best info/experts but have failed so badly in so many areas. Why don't you listen to them?
@keckery Facts are clear: BHO failing middle America, elites prospering. HRC promises more of same.USA in decline. Time to change direction.
@RedState Her email was hacked. The bad guys knew who the drones were targetting and moved them to safety. This is leadership? What a joke.
@kcraFinan Sunrise at Gibson Ranch https://t.co/AKdT51mIFo
@cspan @HillaryClinton Listening to HRC lecture Trump on temperament is like listening to the batboy tell Kershaw how to pitch.
@business If voters use merit to evaluate choices then HRC is in big trouble. Obama/Sanders exposed her flaws. Gender alone is not enough.
@PolitiFact LOL U r right. Publicly owned items they "accidentally" took to NY when they left the White House returned after investigation.
@ThisWeekABC @HillaryClinton HRC DQ'd based on policy failures: Arab Spring, Syrian red line, nonexistent Asian pivot, Russian reset, etc.
@ElmetsPR HRC fails b/c Wall St ties, for-n govt $, endless war, bad trade deals, Arab Spring, Asian pivot, emails. U support this? Really?
@MarcosBreton Crooked Numbers!
@MarcosBreton Saw Clark at Candlestick hit frozen rope never higher than 12 feet. Ppl in left field bleachers scattered. Lfldr never moved.
@MarcosBreton Shark batting now.
@ElkGroveNews @MarcosBreton @NBA
@ElkGroveNews I only have one TV. I'm watching the Giants!  Anything else would be uncivilized!0
@MarcosBreton there is NOTHING else on! Go Giants!
@MarcosBreton SAFE!
@MarcosBreton Go Giants!
@CNNPolitics Red Alert! Shields up! Scottie! I need warp 9 NOW! Lol. Doesn't get much better than this. Go Navy!!!!
@AC360 Remember the TV denial by Pres Clinton w/HRC nodding? Be a cakewalk now if she'd just slapped him and demanded he tell truth. Sad.
@Swanny3210 So vote for Clinton. Or more likely don't vote. That's the Clinton plan: depress Republican turnout.
@SpeakerBoehner where are all the pundits who ridiculed this idea when first passed? Boehner plays chess not checkers. Checkmate. Thx JB.
@RepBecerra @HouseDemocrats Hi X. Hope all is well. Do you have a private email server in your bathroom receiving national security info?
@mattduss @joshtpm @SpeakerRyan It stands for total failure on the part of Obama/Clinton/Kerry to protect USA from nuclear Armageddon.
@PamGiarrizzo i respect your endorsement of Senator Sanders. Has he won the nomination yet?:)
@PamGiarrizzo Please share with us who you are supporting.
@SpillaneCa The voters made their choices and the outcome needs to be respected. Having so many voters participate is a good thing.
@SpillaneCa It is not possible to make Obama or Clinton look good. They have done enormous damage to this country. Time to change direction.
@SpillaneCa I have NEVER supported Obama.
@SpillaneCa KS is a friend but I strongly disagree. In the real world that is exactly what it means.
@businessinsider @vicenews How many superdelegates are attending compared to elected delegates? Oh wait...wrong convention. Lol.
@TocRadio @DailyCaller Lol! How would Obama know?
@NBCNews @albamonica Clearly she's off the reservation in Coal Country.
@JohnStossel President Obama says the economy is great. What is it that HRC would fix? Can't have it both ways.
@thehill Secretary Clinton: please share the specifics of how you handled former President Clinton when he went "off the reservation".
@finneganLAT This is not the John Kasich I knew. I cannot believe he agreed to this manipulation. What happened?
@FPMediaDept @SalenaZitoTrib More important question is: Under Pres Obama what long term int'l relationship DIDNT grow cold? Total failure.
@RobStutzman you're my friend before/during/after. Who's funding you? :)
@katiepack @RobStutzman DT funds own campaign. TC/HRC load up on specl interest $. JK: who knows? BS relies on little guy. Who's funding u?
@babyitsmb Good grief! Please stay on subject: the President is making the argument in favor of unequal application of the law.
@babyitsmb So did President Clinton  Please stay on subject: current president is arguing in favor of an unequal application of the law.
@markknoller @HillaryClinton Maybe David Petraeus could ask HRC if she agrees with POTUS analysis.
@RobStutzman @RossStripling Great game! Great outcome! Giants win! Dodgers lose! Making America Great Again one game at a time! Beat LA!
@business Candidates who support super delegates: Xi Linping, Nicolas Maduro, Vladimer Putin, Hillary Clinton.
@foxnewslatino @COCOGOP @BarackObama @realDonaldTrump How's the weather inside that bubble, Mr. President? ...red lines, pivots, resets, etc
@washingtonpost What does it mean when a journalist uses the phrase "...four times less..."? Do you mean 20%?
@jamescdownie @thegarance Its about time! Though I don't understand the grammar of "four times less". Did you mean 20%?
@Amy_Chance I know/respect these individuals. Hope they keep calling/implying Trump supporters r stupid/evil. See you at the ballot box. :)
@MichawnRich If Strickland no show'd last job, then u think he'll show up for next job? Not acceptable in real life. Did he return salary?
@FaceTheNation Not to mention....red lines, resets, Asian pivots, blah blah blah. You've failed. Americans are less safe. Go home.
@HarryBallzak1  Legislation went nowhere. FCC got message.

@Turdhat2  Sanders supporter comes to Trump event to impersonate Nazi. MSM falls for it. Then ruse exposed. Boo Hoo for her. Nice hat.
@RealJamesWoods @slone Excellent research! Hard evidence of how much the professional Ds fear loss of power.
@RogerNiello Lol! I've known you for over 50 years. I'm proud to call you my friend.
@RogerNiello Establishment continues to call Trump supporters stupid. Hard to reconcile with Repub #s way up due to Trump. Bring on HRC!
@RogerNiello Six years of no track record of success. Not prepared to hire another rookie. Didn't work in 2008. Won't work now.
@RogerNiello Guy who will negotiate best deal is probably the guy who makes a living doing deals compared to Senators who blah blah blah :)
@SwedishCanary @EWErickson This ruined my lunch.

@DanielMorain @sacbee_news Breaking news! Stop the presses! Jones will support the R nominee, Bera will support the D nominee.
@AmyLewisKFBK Lol. How can you not love a political brawl? Keep up the good work Amy!
@NBCNightlyNews Trivia Q: what do Mondale, Sanders, and Rubio have in common? Answer: they each won Minnesota. Not a good sign.
@Amy_Chance @sacbee_news Make sure to read the whole article. Implication of a quid pro quo is not accurate. Amy - this is not worthy of you
@HarryBallzak1 Bill went nowhere. FCC got the message.

At closed fundraiser, Clinton cites 'security' as top reason to defeat Trump.  Can we get a transcript of her remarks?
