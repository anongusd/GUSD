@nProctor That seems pretty rigid and unreasonable to me! Where's the room for compromise, Nathan??
@nProctor OK, so to be clear: You're not actually focused on what tools consumers (farmers and ranchers) actually want to service and repair their tractors and combines? Just going to insist that manufacturers hand over software IP and risk safety and emissions laws?
@nProctor I think you'd certainly concede in any industry that it takes time to bring hardware to market (though some manufacturers make similar products available). Glad to see you have no objection to the SOP. We can count on your support?
@nProctor Nathan, you changed the subject from Right to Repair. Equipment manufacturers and dealers are excited to bring to market tools farmers and ranchers need to service, diagnose and maintain their tractors and combines. What's your objection to that?
@nProctor Sure, I'm happy to work on behalf of 1.3 million Americans whose manufacturing jobs would be undercut by R2R. Not hiding any of that.		This SOP gives farmers the tools they need to repair. Why is PIRG insistent on raiding software and intellectual property?
@nProctor Nathan: Speaking of misleading, it was nice to see your tweet. 		Facts: A number of manufacturers make service info available and this commitment will set a new baseline in providing the service tools customers have asked for

Excellent primer on the border adjustment tax versus tariffs via @bourreelam https://t.co/qZaKg69D9P
Which is leading to a conflation of all those issues, and general confusion on the matter. Thanks to everyone for putting up with this rant.
So what you see now is the WH glomming onto the BAT, but in the context of trade/immigration, though it was always meant for tax reform.
Border wall is also in the mix as a separate policy related to Trump's overall immigration policy.
Trump comes along with separate threat to tax imports in more conventional tariff terms, especially in context of outsourced mfg production
Pro-tax reform GOPers have been mostly open about desire to adopt BAT to both write down corporate rates and move to "territorial" system 2/
Soapbox for a second: Border Adjustment Tax (BAT) of 15-20% has long been discussed behind scenes n context of tax reform. 1/?

In response, I promise not to belligerently tweet the Trump speech. But let me know if you want to talk to an actual manufacturer.
So, there's your fact-check: Raising tariffs and diminishing trade will materially harm manufacturers *and the million of jobs they support*
Starting a trade war would raise costs by disrupting supply chains, and seriously diminish U.S. manufacturers' access to foreign markets
These manufacturing exports have been down in recent years due to a variety of factors, but mainly a strong dollar and low commodity prices
U.S.-based construction equipment manufacturers exported $2.7B in the first quarter of 2016; farm equipment manufacturers exported $1.7B
Before we assign weight to Trump's trade views, remember this is a guy who once heard "TPP" and thought the person was talking "pee pee."

@EricKleefeld (Speaking for myself, TARP/equity was preferable to nationalization, and bank activity was reckless but mostly not criminal.)
@EricKleefeld I can't buy that when the govt took an equity stake in banks in exchange for TARP. Profits/losses *were* socialized.
@EricKleefeld 2/2 Though the nationalizing-the-banks argument makes socialists odd bedfellows w/ some Wall Streeters who advocated the same
@EricKleefeld 1/2: And that's fair, but everyone wants to wash their hands of TARP even though it was instrumental in stabilizing the econ

Congress has approved HTF spending, but hasn't allotted the money to meet their appropriation. How are they gonna find $100B every 6 years?
Repatriation or tax reform -- which won't pass by May -- don't do it, and is a one-time fix. Only answer is a new sustainable revenue stream

@TPCarney @acohn98 Wouldn't raise the $100B needed every six years to make existing highway commitments solvent (let alone improve roads)
@TPCarney Also a poor solution that would more likely degrade quality of infrastructure w/ economic and national security consequences.
@TPCarney Which is why gas tax is the best approach and better than tolls. Most efficiently addresses user fee and easiest way to fund HTF
@TPCarney That's where a VMT would come into play, though it faces political resistance. Could also surtax sales of hybrids, etc.
@TPCarney Actually, no. A gas tax (theoretically in tandem with a less-palatable VMT) are most efficient way to capture 'user fee' principle

@TiffanyHaverly @JimBillimoria And for the record, we support Keystone and all infrastructure. Personally, I hope we all just stay focused.
@TiffanyHaverly @JimBillimoria And it was. We trust we can count on Congress to singularly focus on similar victories in the coming 2 years
@TiffanyHaverly @JimBillimoria WRRDA was a great start. But I think we all know it's just one small step toward the overall problem.
@bigeasyWI @EvanMcSan sorta. More that earmarks gave lawmakers buy-in and in turn more incentive to fund the projects.
Imagine if Congress passed a solid infrastructure bill instead of show-votes on Keystone or silly lawsuits. A first step toward improvement.
@EvanMcSan It certainly has diminished the extent to which lawmakers are engaged, but the funding source is equally vexing.
Infrastructure isn't the sexiest issue, and it's easy to take it for granted until you need it. It's a consensus issue for the next Congress
