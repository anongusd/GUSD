Scars from the past (e.g. contaminated soil) need to be repaired.	Dredging plays a key role in achieving all the above in an inspiring and responsible way that enhances and safeguards people’s living and work environment, while securing fauna &amp; flora. 		DGO™ Dredgers!
This growth needs energy, craves infrastructure: ports, navigation channels, roads, expanding oil and gas pipeline networks. It also stimulates the urgent need for new habitat, often close to the water.	At the same time climatic changes enhance the need for coastal protection.

As sure as the spring will follow the winter, prosperity and economic growth will follow recession, if we make the tough decisions now to support credible SMEs.
Sustainable development is the pathway to the future we want for all. It offers a framework to generate economic growth, achieve social justice.
A sincere government knows the way to create jobs &amp; redistribute wealth is by stimulating the SMEs through credible incentives.
There is no super code for economic growth.	We've got to believe in ourselves.
Besides finance, there are critical elements which include skills, capacity, information and knowledge of market; intellectual and managerial leadership.
Firms often need formal finance assistance, failing which under-investment in long term capabilities may result.
SMEs cannot survive by relying largely on own savings, not only to grow but also to innovate.
Govt should identify external factors that can affect positively the development of small and medium scale enterprises in Nigeria
Govt should offer financial support and such other incentives to SMEs in Nigeria in a trend devoid of POLITICS.
There are roles govt should play towards promotion and development of small-scale enterprises in Nigeria.	Govt should identify the constraints confronting the development of SMEs in Nigeria with a view to providing solutions.
SMEs must be encouraged to move into new lines of production and in the long-run become medium- or even large-scale producers.
SME development can encourage the process of both inter- and intra-regional decentralisation.	The development of SMEs is seen as accelerating the achievement of wider economic &amp; socio-economic objectives, including poverty alleviation
SMEs encourage entrepreneurship.	There is greater likelihood that SMEs will utilise labour intensive technologies and thus have immediate impact on employment generation
SME’s create a niche for individuals to grow &amp; flourish. SME’s create strong relationships with consumers which boost business/economic growth
They also contribute immensely to the output of the economy. Research findings shows that a greater percentage of Nigerians work for SME’s
SME’s increase employment.	Small and medium enterprises play a major role in Nigeria’s economy in terms of job creation and income distribution.
Their flexibility to change helps businesses to adapt to market trends and reduces future crisis. Speed is an advantage.
Due to their structure and sizes, business plans can be flexible which is vital for economic growth.
One strong benefit small and medium sized businesses contribute to the present economy is a quick response to their target market/customers.
They form the major components of any economy worldwide, and Nigeria can achieve more rapid economic growth through such medium.
Small and medium enterprises are found in every sector of any economy be it finance, power, petroleum, real-estate, Info-tech etc.
Small companies are classified to have less than 50 employees, while medium sized companies are those that have employees of less than 250.
Small and medium enterprises (SMEs) are companies whose number of employee’s or output falls beneath specific digits.

Happy Independence Day Celebration 🎉	@bukolasaraki @OkeyEnelamah @ChibuikeAmaechi @GovWike @BOINigeria @EkoAtlantic
Happy Independence Day Celebration 🎉	@niwanigeria @nigerianports
@OkeyEnelamah It journey has started. The new Nigeria is a reality. We are only hoping it comes so soon
If there is such a thing as good leadership, it is to give a good example.
The art of leadership is saying no, not saying yes. It is very easy to say yes.
@OkeyEnelamah Managers do things right, leaders do the right things. 	In any case, we cannot build a vital economy by delivering pizzas to one another.
@OkeyEnelamah The time to repair the roof is when the sun is shining. This is the generation to make our dear nation proud. This is the time.
@OkeyEnelamah The business of government is to keep the government out of business - that is, unless business needs government aid, and SMEs do!
@OkeyEnelamah Without any iota of pride, the current effort to drive our economic recovery shld be indigenous as well as ingenious.
@OkeyEnelamah There should be govt incentives that will reward work, enterprise and innovation.
@OkeyEnelamah This is a historic moment for our country. 	Whatever we do, we will still remain the beneficiary of the legacies thereof.
Leadership is working with goals &amp; vision; management is working with objectives.That was a great policy capable of enhancing Nigeria's SMEs https://t.co/oxH3BUZ9b7
@OkeyEnelamah Leadership is unlocking people's potential to become better.	Mr. President's duty is to unlock the potentials of over 170m Nigerians!
@OkeyEnelamah Leadership is not about the next election, it's about the next generation.
@OkeyEnelamah All these are possible and achievable.
@OkeyEnelamah Leadership is unlocking people's potential to become better.	The growth and development of people is the highest calling of leadership.
@OkeyEnelamah Character matters; leadership descends from character. 	The cost of leadership is self-interest.
@OkeyEnelamah @TradeInvestNG Our leaders are most bereft of initiatives. Without initiative, leaders are simply workers in leadership positions.	#SustainTheChange

Besides finance, there are critical elements which incld skills, capacity, information &amp; knowledge of market &amp; managerial leadership
Firms often need formal finance assistance, failing which under-investment in long term capabilities may set in.
SMEs cannot survive by replying largely on own savings, not only to grow but also to innovate.
Government should identify external factors that can affect positively the development of small and medium scale enterprises in Nigeria 🇳🇬
Government should offer financial support and such other incentives to SMEs in Nigeria in a trend devoid of politics.
Government should identify the constraints confronting the development of SMEs in Nigeria with a view to providing solutions.
There are roles govt should play towards promotion and development of small-scale enterprises in Nigeria.
SMEs must be encouraged to move into new lines of production and in the long-run become medium- or even large-scale producers.
The development of SMEs is seen as accelerating the achievement of wider economic &amp; socio-economic objectives, including poverty alleviation
SME development can encourage the process of both inter- and intra-regional decentralization needed for population control &amp; urban planning
There is greater likelihood that SMEs will utilise labour intensive technologies and thus have an immediate impact on employment generation.
SME’s create a niche for individuals to grow &amp; flourish. SME’s create strong relationships with consumers which boost economic growth.
Unemployment crisis &amp; inefficient income distribution among most states within Nigeria can be tackled by expanding and investing in SME’s.
The future of Nigeria lies more on the leverage of SME’s because they contribute more in terms of investments.
SME’s increase employment-Small &amp; medium enterprises play a major role in Nigeria’s economy in terms of job creation and income distribution
It is not the size of the business in a society that matters, but its impact. In Nigeria today 65-70% of its work force is under SMEs.
SME’s play a dynamic role as engines through which developing countries thrive. SME is the power house of Nigerian economy.

Change yourself and your work will seem different.

Leadership is a choice, not a position.

There is no greater name for a leader than mother or father. There is no leadership more important than parenthood.

The art of communication is the language of leadership.
The cost of leadership is self-interest.
If there is such a thing as good leadership, it is to give a good example.		Leadership is a choice, not a position.
I think the currency of leadership is transparency. You've got to be truthful.
Leadership is working with goals and vision; management is working with objectives.
Leadership is not about the next election, it's about the next generation.
One of the tests of leadership is the ability to recognize a problem before it becomes an emergency.
You're only as good as the people you hire.
The art of leadership is saying NO, not saying YES. It is very easy to say YES.
A man who wants to lead the orchestra must turn his back on d crowd.	Obstacles re things a person sees when he takes his eyes off his goal
Leaders must be close enough to relate to others, but far enough ahead to motivate them.
Without initiative, leaders are simply workers in leadership positions.
If stashing away funds offshore is your goal, then I wonder if the capital flight implication of your action qualifies you as a Nigerian!
Nigerian Content can not become a reality until the content of the Nigerian mind and intellect becomes truly Nigerian.

Its not a license to break rules &amp;promote mediocrity. Its not an opportunity to hijack opportunities that rightfully belong to manyNigerians
Nigerian Content is not abt shifting the goal post so that a contract is awarded to a Nigerian friend whilst merit &amp; quality is jeopardized.
National development planning should be categorised into short, medium and long-term with specific milestones and targets set.
Nigerian Content is abt implementing systems, processes and procedures that would ensure global competitiveness.
Nigerian Content is all about engaging in best practices, developing organizations and institutions with good corporate governance.
Capability &amp; competencies that are required to meet targets, developing the right partnerships, alliances &amp; strategies for national Eco devt
Nigerian Content is about mastering an art of service delivery, acquiring technology and knowledge, building appropriate capacity.
Nigerian Content requires a consciousness that overrides tribe and culture. It needs to operate beyond geopolitical preferences.
Nigerian Content is all about value addition. It is a journey of a thousand miles that begins with the first step of patriotism.

We have a lot of passion for what we are doing and for us to move forward as a country, we need to believe in ourselves.
We need to develop d capacity to do things that we would export to the world and halt capital flight. This is our resolve at @Nwakama_Dredge
Nwakama Dredge Nigeria Limited could become a center of excellence in developing engineering expertise as it relates to dredging machines.
Use of local products create both forward and backwards linkages with the rest of the national economy thereby keeping the economy boosted.
Export potential:	There is capacity if supported to promote d expansion of exports thru d production of high quality Nigerian made dredgers.
For every foreign made dredger we purchase, we create jobs for d citizens of other countries. 	The reverse is d case when we buy Nign made
For making this dredger in Nigeria, we saved d owner over N150 Million Naira!	This is the sure path to eco recovery. https://t.co/nLP25XCovB

In summary, dredging plays, and will continue to play, a vital role in the economics of most countries in the world https://t.co/3kMSyssnsr
Dredging also has a role to play in the construction and maintenance of hinterland connections. https://t.co/uGPwb22iNl
This will ensure that ports and harbours, as well as residential and recreational areas can adequately meet these growing demands.
Dredging must therefore be an integral part of any infrastructure plan https://t.co/BbfhhNYkmk
Waterborne transport has been proven time &amp; time again to be environmentally preferable to overland transport as well as economically viable
This will create bigger need for that ports and harbours and consequently, expand dredge need for the development of such facilities
The importance of waterborne transportation of goods will become more obvious and will make it imperative
Furthermore, the effects of technological developments such as the Internet will also generate an increasing flow of goods and services.
This economic boost is due to further globalization of markets and to the opening of formerly closed markets by new trade agreements.
The demographic developments highlighted above will have an enormous impact on the need for goods and services
An increase in coastal populations will place a greater demand on residential, employment and recreational facilities
The average population density in coastal areas is about 80 persons per square kilometre, twice the world’s average population density.
More importantly, urbanization will produce a more than average contribution to over-population in many coastal zones.
This increase will lead in particular to further urbanization https://t.co/xk14NLJrF6
Thus population is increasing at a rapid rate and, according to current predictions, by the yr 2050 world populatn will hv grown to 9 bilion
Demographic developments indicate that human involvement with water-related issues will continue to increase with the passage of time
9. Dredging is also used for maintaining irrigation canals and reservoirs https://t.co/2Z7Q8eV9E7
8. To provide for flood control in swampy or lowland areas, where environmentally acceptable. https://t.co/YpSmyFPUeG
7. General: Other reasons include excavating for underwater foundations and for the emplacement of oil, gas or other pipelines or tunnels
6. Mining: To recover minerals, gems, precious metals, and fertilizers, or the removal of overlying material to reach such deposits.
5. Flood Control: To maintain the discharge or flow capabilities of the rivers, channels and/or natural waterways
4. Environmental Remediation: To remove or 	remediate subaqueous pollutants and improve water quality.	To clean-up contaminated waterways
3. Beach Nourishment: To provide fill material for d protection &amp; replenishment of beaches for recreation &amp; construction of protective dunes
2. Construction &amp; Reclamation: Dredging provide construction materials such as sand, gravel or provide landfills https://t.co/Kjy9Y1eNUV
Reasons for dredging:	1. Navigation: To create/extend harbours, basins, canals. New work is called capital dredging https://t.co/yzdIQdKiJy

Federal Government must take the lead by enacting policies to unlock the structural bottleneck to the economy. https://t.co/12EsZQMrCy
Nigeria culd diversify its economy using what is called d China model whch involves growing local industries &amp; increasing their productivity
It is imperative to diversify our sources of revenue and achieve a more sustainable structural transformation of our economy
Policies aimed at drawing in this huge informal sector into the system must necessarily be deployed at this time.
Almost half of the Nigerian economy is informal and out of the (fiscal) control of government. https://t.co/hXWYNgrGmQ
As the economy becomes more diversified, it becomes less sensitive to fluctuations caused by factors outside of the portfolio
There is no better time to diversify the economy than now. This must be accompanied by formalisation of the “informal sectors".
The sensible &amp; durable way to sustain these industries is Nigerian innovation.	Local innovatn in suport of local industries is d new directn
Diversification may mean revival of industries whch died due to lack of sufficient electricity &amp; over reliance on foreign equipt for support
Govt shld promote industrial development &amp; self-reliance thru optimal utilization of local raw materials as input to the nation’s industries
There is need for gov to look beyud oil money to finance its mch expected socio-economic pact wit Nigerians as encapsulated in Change Agenda
There shld be coherent agenda to mobilize d public &amp; private resources towards replacing oil as our number one resources of foreign exchang
