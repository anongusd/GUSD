@RickRoss I meant my boy Saivio. I work all day and I can’t catch the show on VH1. Besides my cable bout to be cut off
@RickRoss Hey what up Ross? How can a homie get on Signed? I got my Saivio asking about it. He’s lit. I checked out Tube it didn’t say nothing.

@AnnieVOfficiel Comment te dire? J’aimerais tant etre la cette nuit mais c’est la distance entre nous. J’habite aux Etats-Unis. Tu m’as compris?
@funder Oops
@TX_1 @GOP @realAsherRaza Yes. Remove the EPA. Clean air and water are overrated. Also remove the SEC. so what if millions lost their jobs because of  Wall St? Right?
@ManUtd As strange as it may sound United badly misses Fellaini. We know he’s a threat in the air but he also creates and gets in the box.

@heylauriestark Agreed
@ellencarmichael Something really stinks. It’s bs.Tom Price spent more in travel for 8 months than former HHS Sec., Kathleen Sebelius in 8 years.
@ZoraSuleman @JuddApatow Yap.
@AriannaDantone Hmmm.
@Amy_Siskind If you think about it maybe the women in the military want to stay away from der Gropinfuhrer. Who can blame them? don’t wanna be grabbed.
@ryangrim You are actually right. I never thought about it
@antiquedoll1900 @Rob__USA @MikeHwrdfla @bessbell @VanJones68 I confess that I didn’t know that and I’m guessing men in congress don’t either. The fact that there are less women in congress doesn’t help
@bessbell You are on point
@Amy_Siskind Is it similar to when so many women stay in abusive relationships? Maybe women are truly that forgiving. Women are complex that’s for sure
@Susan_Hennessey Lol
@SpeakerRyan I’m guessing by taxpayers you mean Donald Trump and his cabinet. They are the major beneficiaries of your tax plan.
@maynam777 @celinedion @YvetteAvril Dieu vous garde. Il va vous aider.
@celinedion Merci beaucoup. “Car c’est la amour que nous delivre de doute et de la peur”. Quelle chanson! J’ecoute “Je nous veux”.
@FIFAWorldCup @FAWales @oefb1904 @FAIreland @azzurri @ISRAELFA @SeFutbol @HNS_CFF @FFUKRAINE @footballiceland Easy. Italy
@RepYvetteClarke Not in Trump’s America. If you told Trump Obama invented the cure to cancer he’ll reverse it.
@CWRiverdaleNews Ay mi, tantas opiciones pero que hermosa la Portuguesa a la izquierda no? La blanca tampoco tiene defectos. La negra, no la conozco todavia.
@jimsciutto Don’t you just love Donald Trump? He can’t help with trying to get ratings. He ends his speeches like tv, now we wait for the next episode.
@jimsciutto Trump’s plan is to undo everything Obama did. It doesn’t matter what it is.

@SportsCenter Poor choice of words homes. Guys, Cam should just take the L. No need to drag this out into an argument. The woman was doing her job as pro
@aterkel He said he is a germaphobe. That’s the reason he gave when asked about the Russian peeing scandal. I’m guessing that excuse applies here.
@JourdanRodrigue @1followernodad Touché.
@arielboone @democracynow @MuslimARC @NPR Thanks for the correction
@FloydMayweather @craigleastmond Word on the street is that Money Mayweather is behind on his taxes. I hope that’s fake news
@democracynow @MuslimARC Didn’t the news say that Vegas was the deadliest shooting ever? I thought 60+ was greater than 50+. Maybe I need to do math remedial
@thehill No surprise there.
@diarioas Eso no es verdad. Madrid miente
@HirokoTabuchi If only there was someone that could educate him on the Japan tsunami in 2011 and the environmental effects.
@GiorgiaMeloni Buona notizia
@AliAbunimah That’s a perspective I’ve never considered before but ok
@elmundoes @Papel_EM Sera que tiene que ver con el desempleo?
@ericgarland Nice try, but no.
@SpeakerRyan Simplicity is great but it’s not the only objective of good tax policy. How about maximizing revenue, reducing income disparity etc?
@RandyWerth I don’t think that civilians owning a machine gun is reasonable application of 2nd Amendment.
@CNNEE Eso no nos sorprende. Toma en cuenta que esta vez Trump dice que no se puede sacar conclusiones precipatarias.
@GaelGarciaB Pero mientras estamos en la tierra tenemos que hacerle responable por su deber no?
@natashaleggero @colbertlateshow Congratulazioni. Tu sei incita? Is that a baby bump?
@1followernodad Peut etre. I think if women ruled the world we might see something like that happened. Elles sont plus pacifiques.
@AndreaChalupa @peterdaou Ouuuuu. Side chick is going to be cashing in the checks. I ain’t mad at her. She should get the bag.
@abbydphillip Ooh. He is caught. Didn’t want the wife to know. Might as well resign.
@JohnJHarwood So what happened to the national debt and how about the CBO score? These guys are a bunch of frauds. No understanding of economics.
@RandyWerth Republicans have this fantasy of a Rambo state. Unless you are a veteran or in law enforcement, having a gun doesn’t prepare you to react.
@FoxBusiness @JanMorganMedia So the solution is to have everyone have unlimited access to any kind of weapon with the hopes that a good guy might be carrying?
@KatyTurNBC @MaxBoot If I didn’t know any better I’d say you made it up but we’ve come to expect this from Donald Trump.
@melivegamayerle @SpeckTara @BBCWorld No te hagas. Trump is unbelievable. Espero que esa experiencia sirva como una leccion. People should remember it for 2018 midterm elections.
“Non lasciami mi mai da sola anche un attimo”. Ascoltando “con la musica alla radio”. Laura Pausini e una cantante incredibile. Viva Italia!
@mlcalderone @JakeSherman Benvenuto nel mondo di Trump. He does that a lot. Pass the word around maybe your colleagues will pick up where you left off.
@CBSNews But you want to get rid of Obamacare which has made mental care available to millions for the first time. I wonder if Paul Ryan means it.
@christina_ochoa Me pasa lo mismo. Andiamo avanti.
@ScaramucciPost @Scaramucci I have to give to the mooch. The guy is quite a character. I’d like to see him in Hollywood. It’ll be fun.
Five years since I joined Twitter and Donald Trump is the one who makes me use it the most. At least his presidency is good for something. https://t.co/k5qr0JIUtH
Our hearts go out to families of the victims of the Las Vegas shooting. Estamos rezando por ustedes.
@carlquintanilla @NYSE Que exactamente estas insinuando? Rising gun sales, terrorism or what?
@madisonpettis It’s easy. Hawaiian princess, Cleopatra, Queen of Sheba. You have lots of options
@FoxNews A Gallup poll in October, 1964 found that 73% of Americans wanted blacks to stop protesting civil rights. Oh let’s go through the archives.
@Carra23 I think Gary Neville is teasing you Carra. I thought Liverpool were going to challenge for titles this season. I was wrong
@elchiringuitotv Si votas para independencia tienes que pagar la consecuencia
@itsgabrielleu Gotta get attention somehow right?
@FLOTUS Kind of hard to do if there was no Obamacare no?
@Everton @BurnleyOfficial @premierleague @PLinUSA Everton have been comical. Their decision making in the final third has been awful yet again
@jpedrerol Te refieres a Catalonia?
@misscherrylala Vous vous ressemblez. You too look alike.
@ClaMarchisio8 No. Impossibile. Ma Donald Trump pensa che sia falso.
@WendyWilliams Part of me feels uncomfortable with this. The fact that they are twins and......

@keithboykin @CharlesMBlow You said it bro
@bbcmundo Las palabras de Trump te recuerdan de algo? Decian lo mismo a los negros.
@HeidiPrzybyla @USATODAY I’m guessing through ambassador Rodman?
@Jack_de_Cripps @trukkikuski @MailOnline Touché. I do think we should ask ourselves what are trying to achieve when deciding on public policy and why.
@tonyposnanski @LibyaLiberty And Rodrigo Duterte and judge Roy Moore
@tonyposnanski @LibyaLiberty Yap
@DadTiagol @MailOnline All we had to do to solve terrorism was a dress code who  knew? Trump solved terrorism by using the term “radical Islamic terrorism”
@roxshade @FoxNews @dbongino @CNN @MSNBC It’s also the mayor, Puerto Rican representatives, Marc Anthony, J Lo and Puerto Rican civilians caught up over there in the disaster
@FoxNews @dbongino Yes. The biggest problem in PR is MSM not the lack of water, food, medicine, communication etc. A good coverage is all that matters
@FoxNews @h_scherlacher @splcenter Only the president reserves the right to do that like firing NFL players for kneeling. Nazis protesting Charlottesville were fine people
@Justjan64 @FoxNews Which is why Trump is focused on the economy. His tax bill will help the disenfranchised and oppressed Wall Street banksters.
@CouchKen @kjhurls1888 @KazoliasG @FoxNews Have you ever heard of economics? The US is a post industrial economy with big structural problems. I recommend reading the Feds Beige book
@FoxNews So we are using annualized GDP figures to compare to quarterly figures for Trump. Using quarterly figures Obama's economy reached 3% 8 times
My phone  I
@CouchKen @kjhurls1888 @KazoliasG @FoxNews You mean to tell me that you don’t realize that the graph shows annualized figures while that da##has
@Grumpyme4 @DadTiagol @MailOnline So your argument is that you know what’s best for women better thang they do because of what? Al
@Grumpyme4 @DadTiagol @MailOnline So your argument is that you know what’s best for whom
@Stephen28452318 @SpursOfficial @HKane You don’t seriously see Son as a great replacement for Kane for a team supposed to be fighting on all 4 fronts do you?
@richlenzi @FoxNews @RCamposDuffy Wall Street banksters and market manipulators caused millions to lose their jobs in 2008, but no matter, they are job creators.
@peanutandsnow @FoxNews @RCamposDuffy Exactly. And great presidents like Bush Jr, Nixon, Buchanan, Johnson, Hoover and Trump all had great resumes. So what if Trump like nazis?
@FoxNews @RCamposDuffy Agreed. The oil barons and by Wall Street fat cats barely made a living while the poor were mooching on welfare. Obama only 8 qtr of 3%
@trukkikuski @MailOnline Right? Like, men should be the ones who determine how women dress right? It’s our right, right? Starting to understand democracy
@DadTiagol @MailOnline You are very smart. Women covering themselves up is dangerous for national security reasons. So if they are scantily dressed it’s better.
@MailOnline Hmmm.
@ManUtd @AnthonyMartial Romelu Lukaku wasting so many guilt edge chances. Doesn’t he want to challenge for golden boot?
@GaryLineker Last time it was the middle finger, this time the dive. Maybe you should pull him aside and lecture him. Young players nowadays ma
@SpursOfficial @KyleLPeters @trippier2 Moussa Sissoko is utterly and completely useless. He is unworthy of the Tottenham Jersey
@SpursOfficial @ericdier @ChrisEriksen8 @HKane Disgraceful dive by Alli. Deserves a red card and a suspension
@RonWyden What decent person in his right mind would want to work for this administration?
@lilireinhart Thoughts and prayers with you and your family
@SpursOfficial @HKane @Ben_Davies33 Great performance, great team but shouldn’t Spurs fans be furious with the lack of depth?What happens if Kane, Alli and Ericksen get injured
@kcommons15 Everything except for pace of course.
@Univision No hay nada que me pueda sorprender de la administracion de Trump. Si quieres saber la definicion de racismo busqua “Trump” en la red
@realDonaldTrump I guess. It was fake news under Obama, but now it’s real news. I guess facts depends on who is in office nowadays.
@greta We’ve always known that. What was your position on Citizens United again?
@JohnJHarwood @KatyTurNBC @SaraMurray Beautiful ladies I say.
@libertador_dig @marcorubio @USEmbassyHavana Pero esperabamos que las cosas iban a mejorar despues lo del Obama pero el odioso de Donald Trump quiere quebrarlo todo
@marcorubio @USEmbassyHavana No quiero ofender but what do you have against the regime? I feel like Trump is trying to manufacture a situation to overturn Obama's policy
@paleblueeyes24 @ananavarro Ojala. I hope so
@soledadobrien That got me furious. The governor should stick to the facts not try to grovel to Trump for aid. Just speak the truth.
@UniNoticias @jorgeramosnews Estas perdiendo tu tiempo Jorge.
@ananavarro Ay Ana. Te vas a cambiar por democrata? I don't think the GOP establishment will be happy that you are telling Puerto Rican's to vote dem
@marianaatencio La diferencia? Donald Trump. El pensaba que los Puertoriquenos son Mexicanos. We expected that from him though.
@FoxNews @TuckerCarlson As opposed to when Trump called Mexicans rapists and murderers, the inner city is hell. Nope, no racial demagoguery.
@_KingComplex That's what I said
@CNNEE @ricardorossello Si. Pero porque el gobernador esta arrodillado al desgraciado de Donald Trump?
@TheYoungTurks @YouTube Couldn't have said it any better.
@SenJohnMcCain @SenMikeLee You guys need to do a lot more than that. Puerto Rico has been neglected for too long
@NYCMayor Good job Bill.
@CNNPolitics However, they were quick to determine that the NFL kneeling was a fireable offense. Interesting no?
@KamalaHarris It bothered me that Obama couldn't pass it. That was the last chance. No way these republicans are going to do that now.
@Bakari_Sellers Touché. Hey isn't Bakari an Islamic name just like mine for e.g? It says online that you are Zionist. Can't seem to reconcile that
@ChelseaClinton Sort of makes me wonder when we take the higher ground and point fingers at other countries on the treatment of women.
@OfficialJLD Get well soon. Wish you all the best
@HuntsmanAbby @JonHuntsman Congrats
@marcorubio Such a soft response. Would you respond that way if the president was Obama? Call Trump out. He doesn't care about Puerto Rican's. Admit it
@Everton The players should be ashamed of themselves
@Everton That was a disgraceful performance. How is is possible that Everton couldn't take all three points from Cypriot minnows?
@GarethBale11 What do you think of Carvajal not squaring that pass in the first half? It was stupid and selfish by him, manager should've been furious.
@ChelseaFC Fantastic tactical display by Conte's Chelsea. Conte matched Simeone on the tactics and got it perfectly right. Morata should've had 3.
@NYCMayor Did any of you tells tell Trump Puerto Rican's  are Americans? He probably thought they are foreigners, like Mexicans. He hates Mexicans.
@girl_onthego @marcorubio Great question. Your move Mr Rubio.
@marcorubio I know you belong to the same party but you should speak up against Trump. The guy could care less about Latinos and we all know it.
@TulsiGabbard I'd like to see you introduce a bill in the House. How about dealing with the rising cost of books as well?
@MeghanMcCain I'm so sorry Meghan. I hope young republicans like yourself would speak out against his intolerable behavior.
@MSNBC Roy Moore is quite the character. He makes Steve Bannon looks like a wimp. The guy held a gun on his own rally. Now that's a conservative.
@ananavarro NFL player beats his wife, no protest. NFL player kneels for racial justice now that's gone too far. Hmmm
@itsgabrielleu Oops. That's Trumpelthinskin for you.
@BarackObama God bless the world and most people in it.
@davidaxelrod Isn't he a climate change denier? Pruitt in charge of the EPA is like the KKK in charge policing the hood.
@marianaatencio I thought Gabe Gutierrez was doing that. Who's going to cover Mexico now?
@ananavarro A Trump le importa poco. He just bashed PR on their debt problems.
@itsgabrielleu How about that?
@JoyAnnReid This wasn't on my American history textbook even though the flag and the national anthem were part of the curriculum.
@ChelseaClinton He is busy tweeting about sports players.
@marianaatencio Es una locura no cres?
@BarackObama Ditto
@FLOTUS Is she throwing shade at the Donald?
@marianaatencio @BastidaKarina Sera que Mexico puede recuperar despues de este tragedia? Folks are worried if the aid will last. A Trump le importa poco.
@StephenAtHome Trump fans say he meant Namibia, but they don't have a great healthcare system like Trump says they do
@BarackObama Couldn't agree more with president Obama. So much class
Good community shield win by Man U. I do have a problem with Blind playing center half though.
Congrats to team USA for the win against France in Bello Horizonte. Hope Solo was magnificent again.
For Hillary Clinton safety trumps excitement. Tim Caine is a safe pick. Wish him the best
Amazing speech by Ivanka Trump. She is by far better than her father in every way, and we saw why tonight.
@thehill Based on what evidence? Ever heard of ancient civilizations like Mesopotamia, Egypt, Mesoamerica and China?
I'm no supporter of Trump. You can probably tell, but Melania delivered a resounding speech for the Donald.
Terrorisme encore en France. Dieu vous garde.
Simply put France didn't have enough quality on the flanks to break stubborn Portugal. Also, Benzema's absence hurt them.
@le_Parisien C'est pas possible. Il n'y aura jamais un meilleur joueur Francais que Platini sauf pour Zidane biensur
@le_Parisien @LeParisienSport la France certainment gagnera
No surprise about Germany's dominance on the flanks. Evra and Sagna are 37 and 35 respectively. Old enough to have grandchildren.
@Trevornoah Hey man I know it's off topic but check out the movie "Die Geliebten Schwestern" You'll love it. Amazon
My heart says France, L'equipe domicile , but my head sans emotions says Germany. Vive la France ou l'allemagne?
Good riddance by Heat with Wade or great move by Bulls? Dwayne Wade is 34 with a bad knee. With a $51M contract I'm not so sure.
Don't mind the game management of Wales so far but they've got to be able to switch the play off the turn. Bale needs to be sharper
Sera que es verdad, Messi gets 21 months for his taxes?He isn't really going to do the time is he? Me cuesta creer lo.
With KD going to Golden State surely they are unstoppable now. I just can't see Cavs retaining the title
Two thumbs up http://t.co/ODFTIXVQKn
@AsianWiki   This looks like a good one korean drama "good doctor" that is.
