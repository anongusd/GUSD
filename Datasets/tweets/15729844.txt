I still identify as a neo-Bundist, or a binationalist -- as someone who believes in the possibility of building truly equitable multiethnic societies. But, I feel like this belief comes more from hope than an accurate read of human nature or history.
The history of anti-Jewish oppression makes us constantly have to ask ourselves: is it possible to have a society in which different kinds of people live together in harmony? 		In eras like this, the answer seems clear: no. We can't. I don't want to believe it, but it seems true.
@aherrera_122 the historical experience of Jews in the Soviet Union was not good my friend
Although I would never have been a Zionist, I do believe in self-determination for Jewish people. It's a shanda for the ages that we have chosen to use our power in the same way that those who oppressed us did. 		We have become everything that we feared.
I'm sure I'll get ratio'd for saying this, but as an American Jew, it's hard not to feel like liberalism, ZIonism, socialism and bundism all failed.
As an American Jew, there really isn't anything sadder than watching fascism rise in the United States and in Israel. 		As much as I feel anger, I also feel heartbreak at the failure of liberalism and Zionism. Neither are my beliefs, but both were meant to be homes for my people.

@irenecolth Of course. I think Sanders would look at American racism as originating from slaveholders desire to create a racial caste system that divides European indentured servants from enslaved African people. There is a Marxist take on American racism.
The central unifying idea of Bernie‚Äôs politics is Marxism: he believes the central conflict in society is between those who own and those who work.		Lots of pundits and journalists think he misses a lot with that lens. I think you miss more without it.

The Democrats should use this as a moment to call for impeachment and the resistance should be using this as a moment to mobilize for impeachment. 		We need to treat Trump like the threat to democracy that he is and try to immediately remove him from office.

The GOP is a threat to our democracy: they have chosen white nationalism over the constitution and the rule of law. It's not just Trump -- the Congressional GOP has his back even as he oversteps Congressional authority. 		We have to break up the GOP, so that it can't take govern.
Declarations of emergency are key moments in the failure of democracies: the authoritarian pushes the system beyond the breaking point. 		In the state of exception, anything becomes possible. The breach to constitutional order is small in this case, but the slope is slippery.
I'd like to find reasons to criticize this speech, but it's basically just a rambling incoherent mess of a mentally deteriorating, racist old man.

In the next five years, the left has to start fighting for political reforms to make shutdowns and executive overreach less likely -- and transformative policy like #GreenNewDeal possible. 		Like Reconstruction and the Progressive era, we need to expand our democracy to win.
The #NationalEmergency also shows why liberals are wrong to try to defend the status quo prior to Trump. Our democracy has been in collapse. 		It's not just inequality --  polarization is leading to gridlock, which makes legislating impossible. We need massive political reforms.
The real national emergency is that we have a 230 year old political system that allows a white supremacist minority to hold the presidency and the Senate with 40% popular support. 		Turns out having a political system designed to be a compromise with slavery was bad. Who knew!
This is the kind of thing that happens when democracies are in collapse: the executive seizes power when they can't get their way in the legislature. 		It's a grotesque overreach that's only possible because our political system is failing. The GOP is an authoritarian party. https://t.co/Hes10tWs18

@IdrisMartin @Ryan_Reilly78 @TheHipsterRebbe @EgSophie Strongly agree!
@IdrisMartin @Ryan_Reilly78 @TheHipsterRebbe @EgSophie I think the left often misses / misunderstands antisemitism, but I don't think that black or brown activists are at all unique in that.

Today, @IlhanMN modeled how to be a leader in a time of crisis. Instead of retreating from the substance of her critique, she stood strong. Instead of defending her words, she listened. 		Building solidarity is hard. But it's a lot easier when we have leaders who are good people.

@AngryBlackLady Her first tweet implicitly referred to all Jews, but either way the vagueness is part of what makes it problematic.
@AngryBlackLady As a Jew, I think vaguely alluding to Jewish control through their money is a clear use of an antisemitic trope. The lyric has antisemitic overtones in that context. She seemed to be suggesting Jews secretly control the GOP with their money.
@AngryBlackLady I love Ilhan and I trust her leadership. BUT a lot of Jews were on edge around her because of her tweet about "Israel hypnotizing the world" - which is another antisemitic trope. This is another clear antisemitic trope (even if non-Jews don't exactly hear it that way).
mood https://t.co/X9frsxcISK
@AngryBlackLady It's totally fair game to mention the influence of Jewish donors on our politics, particularly in regards to Israel. It's important to do so without using antisemitic tropes around secret control by Jewish money. Using glib and vague references can veer into those tropes.
@Rrrrnessa Yes, but we're at a historic inflection point; the tide is turning. But we need to be smart and choose our battles wisely (and not give gifts to our enemies). That's why I'm so upset about this whole ordeal -- it's a setback and a self-inflicted wound. But don't worry, we'll win.
@EmmaVigeland @Ilhan This is not a good take, in my opinion.
@Rrrrnessa Oh absolutely; our enemies are our enemies, and they will use whatever they can against us. I just mean that I think we can win this fight about where the Democratic Party stands on Israel. We're losing this round because we picked the wrong battle.
@Rrrrnessa I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs the takeaway! The tone and form here is the problem ‚Äî if we frame the substance differently we can win this fight.
@ben_mishiev I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs unreasonable to expect members of Congress to learn enough about antisemitism to not accidentally beer into it.
@lil_yenta gonna have to agree to disagree
@ben_mishiev Yeah, it was clearly a smear from jump. Also, Ilhan made a legitimately bad tweet that was a self-inflicted wound.
@lil_yenta @IlhanMN @SpeakerPelosi Her first tweet was antisemitic my friend!
The right wing -- and their allies in the Democratic establishment -- will use accusations of antisemitism against @IlhanMN to destroy the power of working class women of color. 		We can't let them cynically use a bad tweet to undermine her leadership.
@mtracey @IlhanMN @SpeakerPelosi Nope! I said her first tweet was antisemitic. And it was.
It's true that leftists like @IlhanMN sometimes use antisemitic tropes when discussing the influence of Jewish donors on our politics. 		But, the GOP openly engages with Nazis-sympathizers and fans the flames of antisemitism. It's not remotely commensurate.
American Jews need to stand with @IlhanMN as she's attacked by the Democratic Party establishment (even as we push her to grow in the ways she needs to). 		It's ridiculous for @SpeakerPelosi and leadership to sanction Ilhan for a single bad tweet. They want to cut her down. https://t.co/Fbsx0WdrNe

@Rrrrnessa @IfNotNowOrg Absolutely. I know full well what @IlhanMN meant and I agree with her underlying sentiment. I truly have so much faith in her as a leader and expect she'll get better at this. I just hope she'll hear from Jews that support her and grow in the ways we're asking her to.

@sophcw I don‚Äôt think the GOP supports Israel (or guns or anti-immigrant stances..) because of money. They support those things because they are racist and so is their base. They like punishing people of color and they don‚Äôt have to be paid to do it.
@Rrrrnessa @IfNotNowOrg Without a doubt that is extremely possible! It‚Äôs not particularly hard even. But part of it is also listening when Jews who agree make good faith arguments about the kind of language that‚Äôs problematic. (And Jews listening to Muslims talk about the double standard as well).
@tyler_bellstrom @bungarsargon @IlhanMN Fair point! But if he stopped giving tomorrow, would the GOP take a more conciliatory approach to the Israeli Palestinian conflict?
@Rrrrnessa @IfNotNowOrg I understand why the complexity of antisemitism is so annoying for non-Jews (and especially for Muslims). But I think it‚Äôs possible to acknowledge sometimes criticism of Jews and Israel do actually veer into antisemitism without diminishing the substance of the criticism.
This is my take: there is nothing wrong with calling out AIPAC, but you can do so without being antisemitic. https://t.co/WLv6X6f35Q
@Rrrrnessa @IfNotNowOrg Jewish trauma my friend
@Rrrrnessa @IfNotNowOrg Yeah, I just don't think there is any reason to offend Jews or offer fodder to her enemies by being so vague. She could absolutely critique the role of Jewish money in our politics without antisemitism. She just didn't. I agree with her on Israel and I was still offended!
@ben_mishiev @IlhanMN Oh, I think calling out AIPAC is fine. I think the first "Benjamins" tweet was...not great.
@Rrrrnessa @IfNotNowOrg The second tweet was fine! The first one was not.
@IlhanMN I hope you will meet with progressive Jews who support your work to combat the occupation but are still concerned by some of your language choices! 		My friends at @IfNotNowOrg have your back and want to help.
@Rrrrnessa I‚Äôm a committed anti-occupation activist who helped start @IfNotNowOrg and I supported Ilhan during her primary. Obviously AIPAC is trash; but you can criticize them without veering into antisemitism. 		I think she can articulate the same sentiment without antisemitic overtones.

@KashifPasta She said "They're all about the Benjamins."
@ben_mishiev @IlhanMN Agreed! I think there is a way you can do that without coming across as antisemitic.
I love @IlhanMN: she's everything I want the future of this country to be. I know she's learning in public, and I will stick with her through this. 		Solidarity is a verb. But, it also means us telling each other when we mess up. And I think she messed up.
It's also just wrong to suggest Jews use money to control the GOP. They support Israel because they're racist (Christian) ethno-nationalists, not because of Jewish money. 		Ironically, most politicians who support Israel because of Jewish campaign contributions are Democrats.
AIPAC and the influence of Jewish donors pushing politicians to defend Israeli crimes is deeply problematic. But, we can criticize that without lapsing into antisemitism.		It's antisemitic to suggest Jews secretly control politics for their own gain. That's classic antisemitism.
@pblest Yeah, the following things are all true: 		1. The right (and center) will accuse Ilhan of being antisemitic no matter what		2. AIPAC is fucked up and uses money to influence politicians		3. Ilhan's tweet was antisemitic

For example, look at @UKLabour: the debate now is between social democrats and democratic socialists. But, they can have that debate now because  @PeoplesMomentum has consolidated control of the party. In the US, we're still fighting between social democrats and neoliberals.
There is a useful and generative conflict between "social democrats" and "democratic socialists." However, this conflict is more useful after we consolidate social democracy as the hegemonic position within the Democratic Party. That battle is not quite won.
If the choice is capitalism or socialism, most democrats will still chose capitalism. But if the choice is between capitalism and social democracy, the super majority of Democrats would choose social democracy. That's where we are: even AOC won't say she's anti-capitalist.
Right now, no one rides explicitly for social democracy.		I think that's a strategic misstep and it could allow for more neoliberals within the party to claim the "progressive" mantle and win over the mushy middle towards compromised positions.
@TomCottonAR You don‚Äôt seem very concerned that capitalism tends towards fascism, so you can go ahead and shut the fuck up.
The Democratic Party is moving towards embracing social democracy: universal, government backed guarantees to everything we need to thrive (health care, education, a job, housing, etc). 		We want to make America like Sweden or Norway. That‚Äôs something we can embrace. https://t.co/agHkOQbGun
Bezos is very evil and so is Amazon and the dick pics are scandalous and the whole thing is hilarious, so it's easy to lose this thread. 		But I'd be shocked if this doesn't come back to Trump trying to threaten and intimidate the publisher of a critical paper. That's the story.
Imagine how this would be covered if the owner of the Washington Post wasn't Bezos: the story would be about how Trump's media enforcer got caught blackmailing a publisher of an opposition paper. 		The story wouldn't be about dick pics -- it'd be about the freedom of the press.
The Bezos story will be covered as an Amazon / dick pick / gossip story.		But, it's actually about how the owner of the Washington Post was targeted by Trump's media enforcers as part of his war on the press. If the Wash Po is an "enemy of the people," then Bezos is a target.
@djlavoie The owner of the Washington Post was targeted for extortion by a crony of the president. That's the story.

@neeratanden @maziehirono I think what‚Äôs happening is that you and your neoliberal allies are losing your grip on the Democratic Party.

@neeratanden @maziehirono I don't care if you consider yourself progressive or not. 		You are actively working against the left because you have substantive political and policies differences: you're a neoliberal, not a social democrat. Just own it. 		We fight you because we disagree; that's politics.
@neeratanden @maziehirono So you think the Democratic Party and associated organizations should refuse contributions from big business, foreign governments and Wall Street?		You think all Democrats should endorse free college, free health care and a jobs guarantee? 		Can I get that in writing?
@neeratanden @maziehirono it's incredibly cynical for you as a corporate funded DC based operative to diminish the grassroots pressure social movements are bringing against establishment Democrats. Normal people need our leaders to do a better job. it's not problematic in the least.
@neeratanden @maziehirono Ok, you can be a True Progressive. I'm a social democrat. 		You're ok with allying with big corporations, foreign dictators, and Wall Street.

@villagevoice @chick_in_kiev Amen. The real backstory of Russia-gate is how Trump's brand became a vessel for Russian plutocrats laundering money stolen from the Russian public.
Trump doubles down on racism when he is threatened. 		It‚Äôs not just to change the subject: it‚Äôs a way remind his supporters why they like him in the first place.
The shutdown and the Cohen revelations are part of the same story: Trump has to keep his base mobilized so they will stick with him through the impeachment fight. 		The Wall isn't a distraction: it's a way to keep supporters behind him at a time of great risk for his presidency.
@Data_de_Groove 100%
The push for electoral reform has started with DC statehood, automatic voter registration and ending gerrymandering. 		That‚Äôs great! We should also include moving to multi member congressional districts, using instant runoff voting, and making the Senate more representative.
@CoreyRobin Anything for you Prof Robin
@CoreyRobin The great opportunity of this political moment for the left is that most Democrats don‚Äôt have strong ideological priors, but can tell the establishment is trash. 		So we can rapidly shift what‚Äôs possible in the Democratic Party by making partisanship (and identity) work for us.
@CoreyRobin Partisanship &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Ideology in the US (at least on the left). Sad!
These kinds of crises are the moments when autocratic leaders step beyond the limits of their authority and destroy the rule of law. 		If we don‚Äôt resolve the underlying structural issues, these crises will continue. The next fascist might be smarter than Trump.
The shutdown shows why, in the long run, reforming our political system is an essential part of saving democracy. 		The Senate is undemocratic &amp; unrepresentative. 		The presidency has too much power. 		The two party system doesn‚Äôt represent our diversity of belief or background.

@AsteadWesley For example, Fox could say, "Trump compromised [our ability to do racism] when he betrayed the country. Real conservatives would never side with Russia against the US, giving liberals a reason to undermine the progressive cause." I think that'd have a real impact on his numbers.

@leahmcelrath @tomwatson @markos @PeoplesMomentum We often conflate partisanship with ideology. But they are quite different, and should be recognized as such.
@leahmcelrath @tomwatson @markos Similarly, @tomwatson is not part of the left. In the UK, he'd be part of the Blairite wing of Labour and would oppose @PeoplesMomentum. In Spain, he'd be part of the Socialists, not Podemos, etc. 		Those differences are hugely consequential and worth noting.
@leahmcelrath @tomwatson @markos DKos was a huge part of my political growth! I worked for Dean in 2003 because of @markos. 		However, DKos is a partisan project, not an ideological one.

It's useful to remember @tomwatson and @markos are not part of the left: they have no vision to radically restructure our economy and democracy to give working people more power. 		They're just Democrats. They are comic book fans, not leaders who will change society.
"Progressive" has lost all meaning. Fanboy Dems like @tomwatson and @markos confuse partisanship with ideology.

@Curious_Chak Yep! That's why @justicedems is like @PeoplesMomentum.
Across the world, new left populist parties and electoral movements are emerging to challenge the tired and failed leadership of the neoliberal establishment that created so much inequality. 		@AOC is part of that wave.
The fight between the social democratic and liberal wings of the Democratic Party happens through primaries. (In a parliamentary system, we'd just start a new party. Alas!)		Social democrats don't have the numbers, but we have the energy. Voters support us, but incumbents don't.
Journalists should also place @AOC in an international context. 		She‚Äôs the US equivalent of @jeremycorbyn or @Pablo_Iglesias_: left populists who reject the neoliberal turn by the center-left party. 		@justicedems is the US equivalent of @ahorapodemos or @PeoplesMomentum.
If the Democratic establishment hadn‚Äôt sold out their base for a generation, no one would be threatening primaries. 		But Democrats have been unresponsive to the needs of the working class people of all races. When we started movements, they told us ‚Äúdo politics.‚Äù Now we are!
People forget that @AOC decided to run for Congress after returning from Standing Rock. 		Like many other millennials, she tried to change politics through social movements. But, establishment Democrats didn‚Äôt change. 		So now we‚Äôre moving to replace them with better people.
The Democratic establishment aren‚Äôt just pushing back against @justicedems and @AOC. 		They‚Äôre also fighting against a generation that led Occupy, the DREAMers, Black Lives Matter, and #GreenNewDeal. 		We got fucked and are trying to take power so we can change things. 		Move.

The Kochs (along with other conservative funders) built a party within the party that could win primaries, discipline electeds, and wage long-term ideological warfare. 		If progressives want to defeat the right, we need institutions which can do the same thing in the Dem Party.
We need a wave of progressive, working class, women of color candidates across the country. 		We need candidates who are proposing transformative policies that would make America a multiracial social democracy. 		And we need help building the institutions to make that possible.

@shaunking @BernieSanders Amen.
@dolladollabille No I totally agree with you. I am constantly complaining about this. But I've sort of resigned myself to the reality that we're not going to change this, so we have to make it work to our advantage.
@dolladollabille The Third Way gets this: it's why they fight so hard to claim people like Stacey Abrams, and say she's the future of the Democratic Party.
@dolladollabille Identity and partisanship matter way more to most voters than ideas / ideology. My biggest learning from this cycle was that if the left is going to win, we need to make those things work for us. Most normies can't tell the difference between Booker and AOC.
At the least, having @BernieSanders in the primary to fight for social democracy and popularize his ideas can only be a good thing -- especially if he has leadership that's more attuned to voters of color.
Without going too much into it, Jeff Weaver didn't get that. Now they can bring in more people who do.
Bernie could be win if he does more to appeal to people of color (especially middle age and older people of color). 		He needs a team who recognizes that and has the skills, relationships, and experience to speak to those voters - and Bernie has to follow their lead.
Jeff Weaver isn't going to run @BernieSanders campaign for president -- which is a huge boon for his campaign. 		Sanders has a real shot if he brings more women and people of color into leadership and lets them adjust the message as needed. 		https://t.co/VksikaHnYf
@juliaioffe The final piece of the collusion puzzle is whether voter file / individual level targets were passed from the Trump campaign to the Russians. 		My hunch is that Cambridge Analytica may have served as a cutout or a middleman. Would love to see reporting on that!
In the UK, after @PeoplesMomentum helped Corbyn win the Labour leadership election, there was huge demand for new voices to go on TV and give Corbynite perspectives. 		Will something similar happen in the US with @AOC and the #Squad? We need more @justicedems + crew on TV.

I would be shocked if @JoeBiden gets more than 5% of the vote in Iowa. He will be a non factor in this race. Mark my words. 		It‚Äôs likely @BetoORourke will fill the fauxgressivs, white guy centrist lane. There will be no space for Biden.
My advice to @JoeBiden: don‚Äôt run. You are not the person the Democratic Party or the country need at this time.		You will destroy your legacy by bringing light to all problematic things you‚Äôve done over the years. 		You will get rekt.
There‚Äôs a notion that @JoeBiden is a good campaigner. But both times he ran for president he finished near the bottom of the pack. 		In 2020, he is virtually guaranteed to make gaffes similar to calling Obama ‚Äúclean and articulate,‚Äù or saying millennials should stop complaining.
There is no place for corporate-backed, race-baiting Democrats in the era of #MeToo, #BlackLivesMatter, Occupy Wall Street, and the #GreenNewDeal.		@JoeBiden has spent his career on the wrong side of the issues affecting Democratic voters. We have the receipts.
Joe Biden is in a similar place today as Hillary in Jan 2015: a former Obama administration official who benefits from the soft glow of nostalgia. He‚Äôs in the news, but not attacked. 		Like Hillary, his net approval will plummet once his record comes under scrutiny.

Donald Trump convinced working class white people he was ‚Äúone of them‚Äù by activating white racial identity.

@Max_Fisher @_waleedshahid As Chantal Mouffe says, ‚ÄúIf the people are to rule, it is necessary to determine who belongs to the people.‚Äù 		In any form of populism the people is constructive. Authoritarians often use racial or ethnic boundaries, but others can construct the people using different logics.
@Max_Fisher @_waleedshahid This is close to true! But who is considered the people? There is nothing inherent to populism that constrains ‚Äúthe people‚Äù to a particular ethnic or religious group. Left populism is almost always multiracial, but is tied together through a ‚Äúchain of equivalences.‚Äù
@Max_Fisher @_waleedshahid This is a hugely consequential and consistent mistake made by journalists. Laclau and Mouffe are clear in ‚ÄúOn Populist Reason,‚Äù that populism is ideologically heterodox. The paradigmatic example of a populist is Peron, who‚Äôs not nearly part of the left or the right.

Whether or not she wins, Democrats would be wise to adopt @ewarren's message about how billionaires that control our democracy and economy use racism to divide and conquer working people. 		We can't support candidates that ignore the reality of racism, or oligarchy.
I'm very worried about candidates like @CoryBooker, @SenGillibrand and @KamalaHarris who aren't opposed to oligarchy and corporate power. 		Per @AnandWrites, the solutions America needs aren't "win-win." We must crush the power of finance and big business if we're going to win.

I don't think Trump is a strategic genius: by all accounts, he's a fumbling moron who can barely read and is incapable of judging a reality TV show, let alone running the world's most powerful government. 		But, his instincts toward racism and xenophobia aren't "bad." They work.
Speaking only to a plurality of the GOP is damaging for Republicans in swing states and districts, and for Trump's chances in 2020. 		But the over-representation of small-state voters in Congress means he can get close to 50% in Congress with only 40% of the public. Racism works!
Trump's political instincts are to double down on racism, because that's what the plurality of Republican voters want. They delivered the nomination in a 17 person field and now they're his bulwark against impeachment. 		He's aiming for a majority of the GOP, not the USA. https://t.co/pgQ7Twj4om

Instead of (or in addition to) diversifying corporate boards, Democrats should introduce a bill that would limit CEO pay to 10x the pay of the median worker. 		Democrats should fight for working people of all races, not to create a rainbow oligarchy.

@Jasonfest Imagine Bernie trying to give Beto‚Äôs famous response on Kaepernick: it‚Äôs almost impossible. I agree this is largely an affective issue: there is no substantive policy stance where Bernie isn‚Äôt the most left. 		But it‚Äôs a persistent problem and a real one that can‚Äôt be ignored.
@Jasonfest I agree Bernie is actually quite good on racial justice when it comes to policy; he‚Äôs just actually a Marxist from Vermont who‚Äôs not good at discussing the lived reality of racial hierarchy. 		He‚Äôd also rather not discuss the reality of racism for fear of alienating WWC voters.
@dsebs @glitterandtwang @YQuidnunc I don‚Äôt think solving the conflict will be simple. But I know we will never solve the conflict so long as our community ignores the role we play in perpetuating it. 		Everyone should learn about the reality of the occupation. It would change many American Jews views.
@dsebs @glitterandtwang @YQuidnunc Yes David you found us out! Our desire to end the generational suffering of millions of Palestinians and the mortal danger to millions of Israeli Jews is actually motivated by a quest for small dollar contributions to a gofundme. 		Totally makes sense.
@melissaeweiss I don't think this was the least bit typical! Lots of stuff happened on my trip that wasn't according to protocol. But the larger point still holds.
@dsebs @glitterandtwang @YQuidnunc Every mega-event is right wing propaganda.
@dsebs @glitterandtwang @YQuidnunc It totally depends on your trip leader. They are discouraged from talking about the conflict, but some bend the rules.
Right-wing allies of Trump and Netanyahu want you to think @birthright is just a free trip. Nothing could be further from the truth. 		It's actually anti-Arab, anti-Muslim propaganda that denies you the truth about the occupation.		Learn more: https://t.co/lqKibrJUqJ
@pareene @ryanlcooper The best
On my trip, one of our evening activities was a simulation of a checkpoint, in which we had to pretend to be IDF soldiers denying entry to pleading Palestinian women. 		Even if they told us their children were sick, we were to deny everyone entry. It was horrifying.
Every birthright trip includes a heavy dose of right wing propaganda.		My trip leader was a settler who told us all Arabs were terrorists and threatened to throw me off the trip for my "Arab beliefs." American Jews were hazed by Israeli soldiers who pushed pins into their chests.
For a generation, Sheldon Adelson and other right wing billionaires have bribed young Jews with a propaganda trip to Israel that intentionally denies the truth about the occupation. 		For more, go to: https://t.co/CFakFUX4iG
Sheldon Adelson sponsors the Republican Party, Benjamin Netanyahu, Donald Trump -- and @birthright.		Sheldon Adelson is a right wing zealot who does not believe in democracy. The projects he sponsors are all right wing political projects that deny the humanity of others. https://t.co/VOxF6YFTMR

@realDonaldTrump ‚ÄúCalm down and enjoy the ride‚Äù is definitely the kind of thing you say when things are going well and no one is freaking out.
By this time next year, Trump will be on his way out or already removed from office. 		The left is going to be larger and more powerful, with leaders in Congress who can push the national dialogue towards our issues. 		And we‚Äôll have presidential candidates stampeding left.
The incredible leaders at @sunrisemvmt spent years building the ideas and leaders. They created something out of nothing. 		@VarshPrakash and the rest of the crew makes me feel like my future children might have a planet to live on.
In 2016, at #AllofUs we made a presentation about how we needed to run populist women of color for office. We used @IlhanMN as the paradigmatic example. 		Now she‚Äôs in Congress with @RashidaTlaib and @AyannaPressley. 		Big changes are coming. This is just the start.
When I met @aoc with @_waleedshahid last winter, no one believed she could win. But it was clear she was a singular political talent who could be the voice of our generation. 		Today she‚Äôs one of the most influential politicians in America. It makes me feel anything is possible.
2018 was extremely trash, but I think we started to turn the tide. 		So many things happened that give me hope for 2019:		- @AOC won her primary		- @sunrisemvmt put #GreenNewDeal on the map		- We took back Congress 		- A new generation of leaders like @SummerForPA rose up

@rortybomb @HarperMitchell I‚Äôm of the mind we should call both social democrats and be done with it.

@hellandreason This is a good question! Honestly, populism isn't about policy, but I think any universal social programs or policies that target the wealth and power of the elite point in the right direction. The key is to talk about policies that help everyone without ignoring our differences.
@golikehellmachi If you think I think that, maybe you should read... any of my tweets?
@AdyBarkan Yes, truth be told, Bernie is running as a social democrat and the rest of the field is running as progressives (even if their records are at best left-liberal). 		Is that fair? Gillibrand and Booker have been pretty neoliberal throughout their careers. https://t.co/pCafoOI9x1
@frakincaprica I am a Harringtonian social democrat! I think we should run inside the Democratic Party, kick out the neolibs and make it a social democratic party (while pushing electoral reforms to make the US a multiparty system). 		I agree social democracy is popular.

No matter who wins the Democratic Party's nomination in 2020, I hope they run on this platform!

Democrats need to run on in multiracial populism in 2020 -- a combination of Bernie's "Them" and Obama's "Us." 		The billionaires, white nationalists and the politicians they control versus we the people - all of us. 		They are dividing and conquering us, so they can stay on top. https://t.co/abzKhCKRaT
The problem is that Democrats usually don't have a compelling version of the "us" or "them." The answer isn't to say "America is already, great."		Obama had a great version of the "us" -- but no adversary. 		Bernie had a great version of the "them"  -- but a weak story of us. https://t.co/hSBKe3lhME
Populism always includes an "us" and a "them."		Trump is also a populist. He ran against the corrupt establishment (see this ad: https://t.co/6Tu5lW1f39). But his "us" only included white people. https://t.co/H31FIdwwRP
America is in a populist moment because the elite has destroyed their credibility. Populism isn't an ideology; it's just a form of politics. 		Democrats need to run a populist in 2020 if we want to win. https://t.co/9uSSlor56W
@MattBinder I don't think it's necessarily about policy, it's more about narrative. Look at this Warren speech and compare it to Bernie. https://t.co/iRDDMVsRbt		She's been very influenced by @anatosaurus's work on race and class narratives: https://t.co/PN7vUxlvGV		Bernie hasn't been.
@Nathanie1Thomas Me!
In the US, we're mostly incapable of talking about ideology. But, it's useful to describe the differences between Liz Warren and Bernie Sanders in ideological terms. 		Warren is a progressive. Bernie is a democratic socialist. The rest of the Dems are left liberals (at best). https://t.co/4siUZ4jV4S
@TomMillerUK totally agreed
Relatedly, if Bernie is going to run on race blind economic populism, he can't be the candidate of the left (even if we agree with him more ideologically). 		Liz Warren is running on multiracial populism. That's what the left should support and all leftists should run on.
@TeenJake_ Bernie is showing how it's done!
Socialists shouldn't wait for everyone else to realize we're right; we should think of ourselves as a constituency like any other that needs to build trust and influence as part of the coalition. 		We should also commit to electoral reform so we can finally have our own party.
@Tyrannogenius I feel the same way you do!
@MrBond2229 Have you seen the documentary? https://t.co/tRZnClJ0eN
If socialists in the US want to maximize their influence, they should join the faction realigning the Democratic Party towards social democracy. 		Socialism isn't likely to become a mass movement, but socialist intellectuals can exert influence like the neocons did in the GOP.
I agree with my friends at @jacobinmag and @DemSocialists these differences are real and they matter. Personally, I'm somewhere in between (I'm a boring ass social democrat). 		That said, I don't think these differences matter to the vast majority of primary voters.
Liz Warren is from the tradition of Brandeis: she's a progressive (in the original meaning of the word) who wants to limit corporate power. To her, the problem isn't capitalism per se: the threat is the concentration of power and capital. 		Bernie is from the tradition of Debs.

The saddest thing about American fascism is how fucking stupid it is.		Trump is a con man, but a transparent one. It never ceases to amaze me so many people fall for it. 		Even after all of this, he‚Äôs still at 40% approval. 		What a country. https://t.co/iG5N7XGN8a

@clairesandberg @mattyglesias @PplPolicyProj Leftists: We really don't care that much about candidates; we really care about ideology. 		Pundits: Leftists claim to care about ideology in order to help Bernie Sanders.
If I advised Bernie (cough @AriRabinHavt), I'd ask him do a speech connecting his family struggle's with fascism and poverty to what's happening now in the United States today. 		Bernie can explain how the revival of fascism comes from the failure of neoliberalism. Get personal!
@mattyglesias I think you're right left policy is winning (because voters are into it), but the left doesn't yet have the power (in terms of candidates, votes, organization, etc) to actually take and hold positions of authority.
My nuclear level take: Bernie is reluctant to talk about his family history or racism in America because of holocaust trauma. Many holocaust survivors, like his parents, learned not to discuss ethnic differences.		It's neither healthy nor wise, but very real for many families.
@mattyglesias It's not "policy," so much as ideology. It's about who you antagonize: the twitter left is Marxist, so we are interested in politicians who meaningfully oppose the power of capital. 		The establishment adopts our policies (which are popular!), but want to stay in control.
@noboa Just being honest! (But, thanks.) https://t.co/SvWnjI2vxb
Robert O‚ÄôRourke is a replacement level Dem on policy, but he does have a talent for talking about racism that‚Äôs unique for a white politician. 		Bernie has real limitations discussing race and racism. It‚Äôs been weaponized by neoliberals, but it‚Äôs also very real and persistent.
@TheM_L_G @AsteadWesley I think about VORP for politicians all the time. DPI is supposed to help establish a baseline for that.
@AsteadWesley @TheM_L_G I think Biden is massively overperforming his xG and expect a huge reversion to mean (expect him to miss out on top 4).
@AsteadWesley @TheM_L_G https://t.co/XJP1b69NdX
@TheM_L_G @AsteadWesley Oh no I read enough Statsbomb to know how little our chances are this year.
@AsteadWesley @TheM_L_G Friends, I like this thread a lot, but I also want Mike to tell us which CM Spurs should buy if we want to catch Man City and Liverpool.
@TheM_L_G That could all be naive, but I assume once Biden gets hit, his numbers will plummet (and as you say: he‚Äôs not great at running for President!)
@TheM_L_G I hear that, but this is why I‚Äôm not concerned: those numbers are based on Biden being in the news and not being attacked. HRC had super positive net approval before the primary in 2015; Biden‚Äôs numbers will go way down once it actually starts.
@BenGoldsmith I‚Äôm a Nordic style social democrat. I want to live in a hellscape that resembles the world‚Äôs happiest nations.
@TheM_L_G Oh the attacks against Biden are going to be incredible. I‚Äôm not even slightly worried he‚Äôs going to be the nominee: he‚Äôs going to get destroyed way before Iowa. 		Not everyone I know in the left agrees, but I don‚Äôt see him as a real threat.
Instead of talking about Bernie versus Beto, explain the conflict as two parties vying for control of the same coalition government. 		The conflict is between Third Way endorsed centrist candidates and those who want to make a hard turn against corporate power.
@sarahljaffe Woowwwweeee
Even when writers like @jonathanchait try to explain the conflict in ideological terms, it falls into horse race journalism. 		The left wants the Democratic Party to offer universal programs that are fully funded. We will attack all candidates who don‚Äôt. 		That‚Äôs the story.
Beto is the American Macron: a fresh face that masks the same failed neoliberal policies. The left attacks Beto because we don‚Äôt want to continue offering market based, means tested policies. 		It‚Äôs not Bernie versus Beto. It‚Äôs the left versus the center. 		JUST SAY THAT. https://t.co/cAoZ54kue5
@Leahgreenb We are all that dog https://t.co/2rIHcZ4stt
@mattkbh I think the eventual nominee will have to adopt all these planks and run on them in the general. Fuck, even Castro supports Medicare for All. Kamala Harris supports free college. Beto (the former New Dem!) takes no corporate money. I think those will become the defaults.
@mattkbh Depends on what you mean by "credibly." I think most of the candidates will move left throughout the primary to co-opt Bernie's issues. I don't exactly trust any of them to really fight when the chips are down, but I suspect it'll be politically advantageous to claim they will.

RT @MairavZ: THIS is Antisemitism. https://t.co/qtGEMyzWaE
Relatedly: it's hilarious how many Resistance twitter personalities hate Bernie, but love AOC. 		She's also a socialist! But because she's a women of color, the ideological conflict is subsumed. 		The path to socialism is paved with "YASSS QUEEEN" captioned instagram posts.
I have no doubt the left's agenda will win the primary. 		I'm not convinced the left's candidates will. 		But! Candidates like @SenSanders who fight unequivocally for what's needed will still push the eventual nominee towards the best possible platform and message.
2020 is going to be a realignment election for Dems. 		The presidential nominee is going to take zero corporate PAC money, and run on Medicare for All, a #GreenNewDeal, free college and ending mass incarceration. 		That'll be a huge win for the left, no matter who's the nominee.
In 2020, Democrats need a nominee who's like @Ocasio2018. 		We don't need a candidate who compromises with the billionaire class, Wall Street, fossil fuel CEOs, or white nationalists. 		We need a candidate who will name how the ruling class uses racism to divide and conquer us. https://t.co/IqW8hpkAbI

@docrocktex26 Currently, my preferred 2020 candidate is Burrowing Into the Center of the Earth. 		I think the left should do what the right did: create an ideologically coherent infrastructure that‚Äôs independent of the major party and use it to capture the party.
@docrocktex26 I‚Äôd like to destroy corporate power so a multiracial coalition of working class people can win a green new deal, free health care, housing and a jobs guarantee. 		I don‚Äôt support Bernie in 2020. I am attacking Beto because we disagree on where we‚Äôd like America to go.

@ryangrim @_waleedshahid @joshtpm It‚Äôs super ironic because the left‚Äôs pushback against Beto wasn‚Äôt coordinated, but the suggestion Bernie is trying to take out Beto def was coordinated.
@ryangrim @joshtpm Yep
@joshtpm It‚Äôs harder for the left to attack liberals like Kamala Harris or Cory Booker because they‚Äôre people of color. It‚Äôs easy to attack Beto because he‚Äôs another white guy.
So many pundits and centrists say, ‚ÄúBernie (the Jewish socialist) can‚Äôt win because he‚Äôs a white guy.‚Äù		But then (hot, young) Robert O‚ÄôRourke jumps in and it‚Äôs like, ‚ÄúOh this guy used to listen to punk rock. He‚Äôs the next Obama.‚Äù		Our politics so stupid and personality driven.
The difference between liberals and social democrats is huge.  		Social democrats like Bernie demand free, universal health care, education, housing and a guaranteed job. 		Liberals like Beto believe we can rely on the market for all these things. 		That‚Äôs why we attack Beto.
It‚Äôs almost impossible for members of the political media to tell the story of our politics in terms of ideas, not just personalities.		Bernie is a social democrat, Beto is a liberal. In a parliamentary system, they‚Äôd be in different parties. That‚Äôs why the left is bashing Beto. https://t.co/RbENmIUuOl

@BedfordMassDems Great question! What do you think?
Given that our political system is so focused on individuals, and so few democratic voters care about ideology, left should focus on recruiting ideologically motivated and committed candidates. 		We need candidates who are more representative and partisan than the centrists.
Sadly, most of the NGO / netroots / professional left does not have a strong ideological orientation either (see: Emily's List endorsements and the MoveOn straw poll). They will not pull the Democratic Party towards social democracy. They focus on issues, not ideology.
@Aldowyn I think so
(This finding is thoroughly documented by @MattGrossmann in Asymmetric Politics, but I thought the rise of millennial leftists and the collapse of neoliberalism might have changed the equation. Thus far, it has not.)
Most partisan democrats don't have a strong ideological preference and mostly vote based on candidate. 		That means the competition between the neoliberal, corporate backed establishment and the insurgent, democratic socialist left will be determined by who has better candidates.
My biggest lesson of 2018: ideology is a very weak force in the Democratic party electorate. Identity and partisanship are very strong forces. 		Ideologically motivated groups from the left and center will use identity and partisanship to battle for hegemony in the party.

My Congressman @RepJeffries is a "progressive" who consistently sides with corporate interests over working people. 		‚ùå He voted for legislation written by Citibank to weaken Dodd-Frank. 		‚ùå He supports charter schools to weaken teachers union. 		‚ùå He takes big corporate $$$. https://t.co/ysEF72Ehv8

@danielmarans @JoshuaHol Sorry Dan! Didn't realize.
@JoshuaHol To me, the fight between the left and the Third Way is an incredibly important struggle about the future of the country. We need to throw the Third Way and their kind out of the party. Jeffries stays in their good graces even while representing a poor, POC district. That's bad!
@JoshuaHol @TopherSpiro @danielmarans @justicedems @RepJeffries @ThirdWayKessler On the contrary, I think the entirety of his career clarifies where his class allegiance lies: not with working people, but with corporations and the wealthy. 		Jeffries used to represent Time Warner as a lawyer. Now he represents them as a leading Democrat in Congress.
@JoshuaHol @TopherSpiro @danielmarans @justicedems @RepJeffries @ThirdWayKessler Most voters in this district care more about being represented by someone like them.		Most media members (like you and @TopherSpiro) care more about partisanship than ideology.		So the fight between left and center gets obscured by partisanship and identity.
@JoshuaHol @TopherSpiro @danielmarans @justicedems @RepJeffries @ThirdWayKessler With all respect, I think this is highly instructive. People like Hakeem Jeffries are very much part of the problem (namely, corruption and oligarchy), but aren't understood as such by most mainstream democrats.
@JoshuaHol @danielmarans @TopherSpiro @justicedems @RepJeffries I'm sure we could find a worse candidate, but it might take some real effort.
@JoshuaHol @TopherSpiro @danielmarans @justicedems @RepJeffries Yeah, the story is bs. Also worth noting: @ThirdWayKessler says, "There is nothing wrong with @RepJeffries." 		Not great!
@TopherSpiro @JoshuaHol @danielmarans There is no reason for a former corporate lawyer and charter school supporter to represent one of the most progressive districts in America. 		@justicedems won't support a primary here, but as a @RepJeffries constituent, I absolutely do!

There is no question the Democratic nominee in 2020 needs to run on a Bernie-esque agenda of universal social programs that take from the rich and give to the working class. 		But, I think we're better served by having a candidate who speaks more effectively to race and identity.
There's a useful debate on whether @SenSanders should run in 2020. 		My idea: Bernie should publicly lay out the agenda he'd run on, and say he'll run if none of the candidates take it on. Then, he should coordinate with @Ocasio2018 to endorse whomever comes closest.

@JeffTheClock @Scotty_Do_50 Yeah, we should also increase the funding for Congressional offices and committees. See: @leedrutman https://t.co/arzdLvladL
@JeffTheClock @Scotty_Do_50 The reason Congress does nothing is because there are too many "veto points" I.e. places where bills can die. If we eliminated the Senate, it's very likely Congress would pass more bills, because there would be less hoops each bill needed to pass through. https://t.co/z2zgaW1ADG
@JeffTheClock @Scotty_Do_50 No problem! 		I think that's overstating things: states will still have their own legislatures, governors, and federal representation. They can choose a different path from the federal government on matters of state policy. The only difference is small states won't dominate DC.
@ballin_Buszka42 read the thread before you criticize
@JeffTheClock @Scotty_Do_50 Yes! States are just collections of people. People should be represented in Congress. We should have a Congress that ideologically and demographically looks like the US. 		Over-representing small states makes Congress less ideologically and demographically representative.
Congratulations to Amazon @NYGovCuomo for bravely giving $1.5 billion from the tax payers of New York State to the richest man in the world.  		I expect the decision will be as successful as Scott Walker's $4 billion dollar handout to FoxConn. You're almost as progressive as him!
It makes sense New York politicians like @NYGovCuomo and DeBlasio would pay Amazon billions to relocate to NYC because there is no other reason for a company to move here. 		Why would any company want to be in the global financial and media capital with access to the best talent.
@JeffTheClock @Scotty_Do_50 States rights come from the ability of state legislatures to write laws for their states that aren't superseded by federal law.		It's not a reason for citizens in small states to have more representation in Congress than other states.
The #AmazonHQ2 deal makes sense for New York because we have no other problems. Everyone has affordable housing, the subways work great, and no one is homeless.

@EN_Pryor The states are just collections of people.		Why do states deserve guarantees of representation, but say ethnicities, or genders do not?
@nlevine25 you literally didn't read the thread
@EN_Pryor literally did you read the thread
The founders do not have a monopoly on wisdom, knowledge or experience. Their constitution was designed for wealthy land owning white men. 		We need an electoral system that's designed to represent the American people - all of us - for the first time in our history.
The point isn't what the founders intended: the point is that if we started out writing a new constitution today, no one would suggest we create two houses, including one that disproportionally empowers people from small states.		We'd create a government that looks like America.
Lots of conservatives asking if I know about the house of representatives or the Connecticut compromise. 		Yes.		Have you heard about the perils of presidentialism? https://t.co/gnH39NSJjL		Or how our constitution is inherently undemocratic? https://t.co/APHxjryRr6 		You should!

@RespectKohlrabi @conservmillen Right now the net flows of federal tax dollars are out of blue states and into red states.  		Funny you mention slavery: the senate was key to defending slavery and segregation.
@kattdavidson Nope! Having one representative house and one that‚Äôs not isn‚Äôt a good system. See: the House of Lords.
@conservmillen That is not even remotely what I am arguing for. I‚Äôm suggesting we either reform the senate to make it more representative of America as a whole, or get rid of it.		States would still exist. They‚Äôd have governors and legislative and federal representatives.
@leahxkm Did you even read the thread
@conservmillen With all due respect, you are coming from a place of ignorance of the many different kinds of electoral systems and the consensus of political scientists on the limitations of our system.
@conservmillen Yeah, no, I understand the rationale, I just think it‚Äôs a bad idea. Wyoming does not have unitary interests that differ from California in ways that justify giving them 50x representation per person. 		No one who started out writing a constitution in 2018 would choose this.
@conservmillen Yes there is no reason to have one representative house and one House of Lords. Like the House of Lords, we should phase out the Senate.
@ryymcc__ Did you literally read the thread
@realNickWake Yes before women‚Äôs sufferage or emancipation or universal sufferage. We can do better.

@JeremyBaartman Yes and we should abolish the senate
@conservmillen 1. Most other representative democracies have a form of proportional representation. I like Germany‚Äôs system. Ours should be more like that. 		2. There is no reason voters in small states should have more representation per voter than those in big states.
@AshleyD1215 Yeah that‚Äôs a bad system

The constitution represented the best thinking on how to create a functional republic at the time it was written. It was also a political compromise that reflected the realities of power at the time. 		Much has changed since then. If we rewrote it today, it'd look very different.
Lots of conservatives jumping in to say the founders made a compromise to allow small states to be overly represented. It's true!		They also agreed to a compromises that said slaves counted as 3/5ths of a person, and only men who owned land could vote. 		We can do better.

@AugustoLivro @yepronsaidit Juan Linz and Robert Dahl are useful here too!
@USWeatherExpert There are 200+ years of experience and learning since then. I have read many books on comparative politics and constitutional design: the consensus is the American constitution is an early, highly imperfect attempt at constitution writing.
@KurtSchlichter I‚Äôm talking about redistribution of Senate seats to make it more proportional, not doing away with it entirely. 		If small states wanted to secede over this, I say we let them. They would be much worse off outside the United States, and stand much more to gain by staying.
There is nothing more American than deciding your system of government is insufficiently democratic and resolving to change it. 		The revolutionary spirit of the founders is based on the radical idea that we can remake our world to better reflect the needs of regular people.
@KurtSchlichter In 2018, states like Wyoming and Nebraska benefit much more from a union with California than California does. It absolutely makes sense to renegotiate the terms of our union given the vast disproportionality of people and wealth.
@TimOfLegend üôèüèªüôèüèªüôèüèª
@mikeyfranklin @fairvote Not an either or! But agreed that‚Äôs where we should start.
@TrevorDMerrill Ah yes we designed the US to ‚Äúrepresent minority opinions,‚Äù except those we designated to be 3/5ths of a human being, and the vast majority of non-landowning non-white men who were not allowed to vote.
@ChaosBahamut Why does this desire for equal representation apply to landmass rather than, say, gender, or race, or sexuality, or class? 		Nothing in our system guarantees equal demographic representation. In fact, equal representation by state is the largest obstacle to demo representation.
@mikeyfranklin @Ocasio2018 It will def be one or the other!
I have a piece on this forthcoming, but I‚Äôll just briefly say: the survival of the republic depends on reforming our electoral system. 		Trump will not be the last authoritarian president if we don‚Äôt deal with gridlock, corruption and lack of representation.
@mikeyfranklin @Ocasio2018 My forever feeling
My suggestion to make the US government more representative and responsive:		- Make the House into multi-member districts with instant run off voting (see @fairvote for more)	- Abolish the electoral college 	- Reform the senate to make it much more proportional and less powerful
The US is one of the only countries in the world with a bicameral legislature and a separately elected executive. There are better (more representative and responsive) systems! 		Ours was amazing for 1776, but we have 200+ years of lessons since then. https://t.co/7G4vINjdEl

@ezralevin @DelgadoforNY19 That‚Äôs the formula!
Kamala Harris was a prosecutor who let banks get off easy. 		Kristen Gillibrand was a Blue Dog who voted against gun control and is married to an investment banker. 		Cory Booker defended hedge funders as good guys in 2012.		These folks have not been consistently anti-oligarchy.
I also don‚Äôt think most wokeitarians realize how awful it‚Äôs going to look if, say, Kamala Harris or Cory Booker run on diversifying the ruling class during an era of oligarchy.		If one of them wins, they must run on a full throated embrace of social democratic universal programs.
Two things can be absolutely true:		1. Business class operatives and neoliberals are looking for Warren and Bernie‚Äôs to slip up, so they can undermine universal welfare programs and more taxes on the wealthy.		2. Warren and Bernie make unforced errors on race and identity.
The problem is there is a missing generation in Democratic politics: if you were coming up during the Clinton era, you learned to moderate and appeal to the business class and white racial conservatives.		Today, none of that makes sense. We need candidates who understand that.
@michaelwhitney No other word
Personally, I love Warren and Sanders. I‚Äôd work for either in a heartbeat. But both are clumsy at best on race, and aren‚Äôt surrounding themselves with the people who can help them.		Meanwhile, Booker, Harris and Gillibrand all came up by being very deferential to wealthy elites.
@_waleedshahid Neither was Bernard
@_waleedshahid @RevDrBarber Seriously

America has two huge problems: oligarchy and white nationalism. 		Democrats need to pick a presidential candidate who can speak to both.		But right now, we have white populists who stumble on race, and other candidates who are great on identity, but not opposed to oligarchy. https://t.co/DYCnILqgI2

Don't listen to any takes that start without mentioning that Democrats massively defeated the GOP in the popular vote and only lost seats because our 18th century political system was designed to be unrepresentative.		It's not just gerrymandering -- it's slave-owner-mandering.
The Democrats won this election overwhelmingly, but our system makes no sense. 		- Nevada is roughly as populous as Brooklyn	- North Dakota is roughly as populous as Denver. 	- Wyoming is roughly as populous as Albuquerque.		But those states delivered the senate to the GOP.
The US has a progressive majority that's being held captive by the unrepresentative institutions we inherited. 		Democrats will win the popular vote for the Senate tonight, but lose seats. It makes no sense to apportion political power by land mass, instead of by person. https://t.co/zXCDBYohEs

@njcurranrn @HenMazzig @jaketapper @bungarsargon The idea that most American Jews agree with Trump on Israel is false. Only 34% of American Jews agree with his handling of the issue.

@HenMazzig @jaketapper @bungarsargon I'm not blind to the anti-Semitism on the left. I'm part of the left, so I can see it clearly. Quite simply: it's no where near the level of threat posed by the alt-right. 		Anti-Semitism is central to white nationalism. The GOP is white nationalist. It's marginal on the left.

@BrgElias @edwardclarke Do those who are depressed have access to mental health services?		Are those who are anxious told their problems are the result of their individual choices, or the way elites choose to structure our society?		Those questions are inherently political and deeply relevant today.
Global elites -- from the US to Brazil to Russia -- prefer fascism to social democracy. 		They don't want the people deciding on how wealth and power are distributed in society. They prefer an authoritarian who protects their investments and helps steal from the public. https://t.co/TYs1nJ3tNd
@BrgElias I suffer from mental health problems and see a clear, direct connection between those problems and the social/political/economic choices of elites. 		Mental health problems cut across ideology, but we shouldn't pretend the challenges people suffer from happen in isolation.
Bernie is right: the only way to fight right wing populism is left wing populism.		A new axis of authoritarianism is rising from the Philippines to Brazil, from Russian to the White House.

Living with mental health problems is hard enough. 		It's even harder when you blame yourself, and can't see the ways your challenges are caused or exacerbated by those on top. 		Much of our suffering is the result of choices by those in power. #WorldMentalHealthDay

We can't counter the rise of white nationalist authoritarianism with a materialist story alone -- a good job isn't enough to give people meaning.		We need to politicize people's longing for a supportive community, and create an ideology of care that values connection.
Whiteness, patriarchy and neoliberalism all reinforce the loneliness epidemic. 		White people and men are taught their role is to dominate -- so many white men can only express their powerlessness as anger and hatred. 		Neoliberalism tells us our problems are of our own creation.
We need to talk about the epidemic of loneliness that's part of the late-capitalist crisis we find ourselves in. 		So many of us do not belong to thriving communities and are left to struggle with our pain and suffering on our own. Our dominant ideologies reinforce our aloneness. https://t.co/1FbgupRq2S

Flaming take: the NoIDC challengers and races like @SalazarSenate18 got the coverage they did because of @CynthiaNixon's campaign (and the support of @Ocasio2018).		Having a progressive at the top of the ticket always helps insurgent down ballot races. https://t.co/bDRYhce1KR

I'd love it if @CynthiaNixon remains on the @WorkingFamilies line in November. 		I'm not going to vote for Cuomo ever again. https://t.co/Z0g2yrzRk6
@AsteadWesley Cuomo in particular illuminates this dynamic so clearly: everyone on twitter knows he's a psychopath, but people who get their news on NY1 think he's a decent guy.

@AsteadWesley This is true as far back as Howard Dean's race against John Kerry. It's also one of the biggest obstacles to insurgent progressive candidates running against the establishment -- older POC voters (who are really the base of the Democratic Party) get their news on TV.
@AsteadWesley Yes to this. Also, older voters are much more likely to get their news from TV and newspapers. Younger voters get their information online. 		Insurgents tend to do vastly better with those who ge their news online - getting on TV is expensive and mediated.
