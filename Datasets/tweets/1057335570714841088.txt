@realDonaldTrump If you cared about troops, then they wouldn't be near the Mexico border for a political stunt.

@realDonaldTrump The Senate needs to confirm people who report directly to the President. This should not include Mueller as special counsel under any circumstances. There are few more conflicted than your lackey Whitaker, and Mueller was unanimously confirmed by the Senate as FBI director.
@realDonaldTrump Voter disenfranchisement works! #takethevoteaway
@realDonaldTrump @WhiteHouse This was so politicized and ridiculous that it was an unintentional parody.

@jaketapper @VP They will force the Mueller investigation to finish prematurely after continuing to restrict what can be investigated.

@NBCPolitics @NBCNews Christie would shamelessly obstruct any investigation into corruption. He is exactly what the president is looking for.
@liuhath @Reuters Recusal is necessary because Whitaker has made it clear he wishes to obstruct any investigation into Russian meddling by acting as Trump's lapdog. And the FISA court denied 12 warrants while granting 33,942 in its first 33 years. Rosenstein is much better suited than Whitaker.
@Reuters Whitaker needs to recuse himself from the Russia investigation, as Sessions did, or else this is overt corruption at the highest level of the Justice Department.

@NewsHour How many votes did the Internet Research Agency and others sway? If Russia could bring out 100,000 votes in the three key states mentioned, that's enough for the to change the election from a Clinton win to installing their chosen candidate, Trump, into office.
@CaraJbg @amigoaguilar @jaketapper @realDonaldTrump A constitutionalist would read the 14th amendment as clear in granting citizenship to people born in the US, but loyalists for Trump will not.
