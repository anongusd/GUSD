@HeatherE2 There are millions of American gun owners who are moderate, or not NRA members, and when all you have to share is blame, how do you plan to change anything?  I'm sure it feels good to just get to be mad and point fingers, but that's not a solution.
@HeatherE2 Some of that research was a waste of taxpayer dollars, some was valuable.  Why did we need to know that gun violence is more common near liquor stores?  What social value did that have?  I don't believe in a full prohibition, but we need to be looking at the value of the study
@HeatherE2 I don't smear them.  I don't hold Democrats responsible for the crime bills that created so many problems with the nation's justice system, just because the Clintons supported them.  I hold people responsible for the beliefs they espouse, party membership is not a straight jacket
RT @NYTStyles: Seasonal affective disorder is REAL and sometimes the only cure is leaving town. https://t.co/HhIPDtphDn
@HeatherE2 Yes, I did. I'm a moderately-minded gun owner, and I wanted to be an advocate for real solutions.  Sadly, the fringes on both sides are deciding for all of us.  We need to prosecute straw purchases and stop the spread of illegal guns, but neither side seems interested in that.
@ajtzielike Yes, they were talking about how the UV rays in a plane are more prevalent and stronger.  I had no idea.
The Parkland teens are incredibly impressive. But it's hard to ignore that the deaths of affluent white children started a movement, the every day deaths of brown children don't even get a blink.
@PirateQueenKate I just always think I'm going to be fine, because no one serves decaf anymore.  And then I'm not.  I'm like a dog that can't be trained when it comes to coffee.

@dcolapinto As a gun owner, I support banning bump stocks. ATF should never have approved their sale.  But without the bump stock, an AR only shoots one bullet at a time, just like a pistol or hunting rifle.  It isn't the number of bullets it fires per trigger pull, it's the high cap mag.

@BCapJe Motives always matter.
@BCapJe But the foundation of the disagreement is whether this is slut-shaming.
@BCapJe It's not the nudity itself. It's the sexualization of women for profit and fame.
@BCapJe Would she'd still be taking off her clothes if it didn't result in likes? Is she doing it for herself, or bc our society buys sex?
@BDavis1776 I think we have different definitions of no harm. She may not be hurting an individual, but she may be hurting on a macro level.
@BCapJe Feminism means the same thing to everyone, equality among the sexes. Yet, only women are told stripping down = power/success.
Decrying a woman going nude for Insta-likes isn't slut-shaming. It's rejecting sexualization of women as the fast path to fame and fortune.
@BCapJe She's a symptom of a society that says feminism/self love = nudity, and that's not a message we should be sending.
@BCapJe their clothes trying to emulate her level of success. And when young girls see the fame, they can't tell the difference.
@BCapJe I didn't say she hadn't done anything else. I don't think she's a slut. But there are hundreds of other "reality stars" who take off
@BDavis1776 Should I celebrate Heidi Fleiss's "success"? Or Farrah Abraham's? Is there a $ amount that makes it okay to earn money this way?

@WesHartline Sure, but that's not a solution. You don't have privacy once the court order exists, let Apple be the one to comply in house.
