Wise counsel from @MichaelSinghDC to Congress on U.S. Middle East policy from Feb. hearing (incl. on link to great power competition, local partners’ limits, risks of free-for-all, Iran threat, long view of U.S.-Saudi ties, Israel’s QME, pol. reform, etc): https://t.co/XcOdiIIpbX
The power of spotting then showing up and competing in geopolitics. 		A clear case (with lots of good lessons for both the U.S. and allies &amp; partners) in an obscure location (Greenland) via @drewfhinshaw &amp; @JNBPage: 		https://t.co/V7Q8cXsiYq
This statement is worth keeping in mind as operations in the last ISIS-controlled pocket in Syria along the Iraqi border accelerate. 		The outcome of the take-the-terrain campaign may be clear. 		But the fate of U.S. interests in #Syria is still TBD.
Last week 77 Senators voted to affirm: the U.S. should “pursue a strategy that sets the conditions for the long-term defeat of al Qaeda and ISIS, as well as the protection of regional partners and allies, while ensuring that Iran cannot dominate the region or threaten Israel.”
Perhaps promises are distractions.		Wise caution (@TheEconomist):		“Another worry is that the Taliban will promise the moon to rid themselves of the Americans, on the entirely reasonable assumption that, even if they go on to break their word, the GIs are unlikely to return.” https://t.co/c7rxU75mbA
Going after the dictator’s illegitimate rule in #Venezuela was a good first step. But the key to lasting and positive change will be helping address the underlying rot in the system and its institutions. Thoughtful take from @clayrfuller &amp; @RyanBergPhD: https://t.co/OQyM4WiQMV
The figure cited in the essay comes from this @ToddHarrisonDC &amp; @SeamusDaniels (@CSIS) report: https://t.co/riY4WwY783
+1. The piece cites a figure every American should be familiar with: the defense budget accounts for only ~15% of all federal spending.		If you really want to get after the national debt problem, zeroing in on defense spending is barking up the wrong tree. https://t.co/O8lFlpNHww

It is worth revisiting the late 1990s record of U.S. attempts to “split” the Taliban from al Qaeda in #Afghanistan. https://t.co/w936ZKvtpj
Plot: #NATO members in Europe must contend with the ambitions and predatory ways of a large, authoritarian state from their east.		Twist: Sometimes that state is #China.		Great reporting bit from @bopanc @DJMatthewDalton @WSJ:		https://t.co/ZandHSwd87
The European officials working on sanctions-busting trade arrangements should reflect on facts like these. Is this a regime they want to, in effect, throw a lifeline to? https://t.co/QNVsLvomxE
The lesson a would-be proliferator would take from the approach suggested in this article on North Korea: threats, deception, &amp; illicit development will pay off on the road to WMD. That type of precedent was also a fundamental problem for the Iran deal.		https://t.co/9RYjLWXqZE
The small mission the U.S. stood up in #Iraq after the 2011 withdrawal was “under-resourced and lacking the authorities and tools necessary to preserve U.S. interests.” 		One of the many important, and timely, findings in the Army’s Iraq War study: https://t.co/V3fhRbprNk
There may be broader issues underlying the kind of deal Treasury made worthy of future Congressional examination: is the “50% rule” (threshold for sanctions exposure) too loose? Should effective control by sanctioned entities (rather than just on paper ownership %) be at play? https://t.co/CqCg23xgxX
The new SFRC chairman offers two ideas that can coexist: that #NATO is “the most successful military alliance in the history of the world” [and therefore worth preserving)] and that NATO member states should deepen investments in defense. Via @dshesgreen: https://t.co/nnAihjUrhk
A necessary frame on #ISIS (and Islamic extremists more broadly): 		“Fighting them is not an option; where we fight them is our choice.” https://t.co/7b7MFRK0m2
The scale of China’s “technology thievery” and military modernization warrant a much more robust U.S. response, argue @DerekScissors1 and @DAlexBlumenthal in a clear-eyed piece with practical policy steps: https://t.co/JCLRH3ZLVy
An untenable position for our German allies: wanting to defend Europe from Russian aggression while allowing Nord Stream 2 to proceed. The U.S. is right to stand its ground on this issue (“Friends don’t let friends...”). https://t.co/s6znya7cVT
Impressive reporting from @TomWrightAsia and @bradleyhope on the colliding worlds of China’s mafia-like foreign policy and the 1MDB scandal in Malaysia (the authors’ book on the latter subject is a great read): https://t.co/52VK7PTBCw
If you read this bill on its merits it quickly becomes clear it ought to be an easy, bipartisan layup. https://t.co/Ls7FaRUJdZ
The #Syria &amp; #Afghanistan bits in this Politico/Morning Consult poll (h/t @playbookplus) raise many questions. What U.S. interests do these voters see as being at stake over there? To what extent are their representatives in Congress informing these views? https://t.co/nt8liMVwJo https://t.co/rNooWkPmnk
A good reminder from my colleague @JennyCafarella that we were not on track to secure all of our vital interests in Syria before this week.		U.S. Syria policy going back to 2011 has rested on shaky ground.		But an abrupt pullback will likely collapse the floor. https://t.co/aeb1maqwVf
It is likely not a permanent shift right now but the general trend is clear (@business): https://t.co/rGdcoeXUWa
Not all news is bad; last week the U.S. sold more oil abroad than it imported for the first time since the 1940s. h/t @JavierBlas
This line from @felschwartz underscores why denying the Iranian regime dominion over Iraq/Syria is essential for the region’s future and American interests: “There may be little Lebanon’s government and military can do to stop Hezbollah.” https://t.co/YuDt8dFK2U
Smart observation from @vanceserchuk — and one that should inform our policies in every region around the globe (https://t.co/o23QXxORFL) https://t.co/xypqbe6vZx
The deployment of the USS Stennis to the Arabian Gulf is a welcome nod to the reality that even as we focus on competition with the likes of #China, we will need to tend to enduring threats in the Middle East, namely #Iran. https://t.co/sValCmLFQX
May we always have the likes of John McCain among us, serving tirelessly to defend our Nation and its inseparable advance for Freedom. Rest In Peace, sir.
