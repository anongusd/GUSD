@KateAronoff They say go for a bad policy that does some good things, then try using that as a stepping stone to better policies. We all know the only approach that will succeed is to build movements behind what we are really fighting for and grow strong enough to overcome any opposition.
@KateAronoff Think u flipped 1 side of the proportion. Should be ACA : single payer (or better yet, NHS) :: shitty weak regressive carbon tax that doesn't primarily target the real culprits : GND. Agreed that the metaphor's not the best, but it's OK. The conclusion drawn's the really bad part
@jryanpascohigh @AirbnbSan @lakeoftheisles @inthebarberry @AOC @Ocasio2024 Nearly all of the candidates Democrats have to offer are old, and Bernie is obviously the strongest candidate vs. Trump but probably too old to run again in '24.  As for Schumer, we saw what happened the last time AOC primaried one of the most powerful Dems in the country.
@jryanpascohigh @AirbnbSan @lakeoftheisles @inthebarberry @AOC @Ocasio2024 A one-term pledge can work to a candidate's advantage and could just leave the field wide open, not necessarily equating to an endorsement of her, but she would still be the clear frontrunner.  In 2022, Schumer is up for reelection,  and I expect AOC to primary him and win.
I will let @AOC say what we must do, because she says it best.  My role at this particular moment is trying to help @sunrisemvmt get enough funding to keep up this push in 2019. I created a fundraiser, so chip in whatever you can, preferably monthly.  https://t.co/nSJMS2VyyC https://t.co/1i6AiP68fL
@AirbnbSan @lakeoftheisles @inthebarberry @AOC In 2024, she turns 35, making her eligible.  Whichever Dem wins in 2020 can promise not to run for reelection, opening the door for @Ocasio2024 !
