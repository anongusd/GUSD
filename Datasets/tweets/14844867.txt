@JonNYC5ive Good one
A congressional hearing could clear this up. https://t.co/gNA76655eq
The biggest question is not why Donald Trump gave Kushner a security clearance. It‚Äôs why the officials charged with issuing clearances through proper channels didn‚Äôt want to provide Kushner with one.
@MamaMadisons If you really feel that way, I will give you a courtesy block so you will no longer be subjected to my thoughts. You are welcome, sweets.
@JonahNRO Congrats and we all look forward to hearing more!
Sometimes I wonder about a dire scenario where Trump really does whatever it takes to win his second term, at all costs, because the confines of the WH are the only thing that protect him from prison time.

How refreshing it is to see House Republicans take such a firm stance against lying. I assume that standard will be applied to all those who lied about tax fraud, campaign finance violations, and matters regarding Moscow Trump Tower, right?
Someone please explain the logic in Trump‚Äôs surrogates attacking Cohen for lying about the very same things they and Trump have also lied about.
Probably the worst person possible to deliver this message, which doesn‚Äôt even make much sense. With this, I‚Äôm getting out of Twitterland. The lack of self-awareness from these 2 women in the Trump Admin is too much. Mwah! https://t.co/gwIFImufRl
Someone please remind me of what Sanders said about the illegal payments Cohen made to Stormy Daniels on Trump‚Äôs behalf to conceal Trump‚Äôs dalliance w a porn actress from voters before the election. https://t.co/U24W2KoUQI
That would be me. Godspeed to Sec. Pompeo and others on this trip. https://t.co/2EZP7WxeZV

Paying people to rig polls and the issuance of hush money falls into that category. https://t.co/EENQe4QRJq
@RealLifeHoser @GOP Don‚Äôt you think I‚Äôve been trying?
@carmelsurfer You are missing the point.
‚ÄúFRAUD‚Äù should be a major Dem oppo argument going into 2020: Trump is a fraud. His family got rich thru tax fraud, stayed rich by using illegal labor and other work frauds, and won the 2016 election thru election fraud. It‚Äôs a devastatingly simple playbook if they can execute.
Let me tell you how this Cohen hearing is going to roll. He will testify about how Trump conducted all types of tax and campaign fraud. Dems will agree with GOP Cohen is a liar and must fire the subpoena cannon &amp; obtain all Trump tax records to verify Cohen‚Äôs claims. -FIN-
