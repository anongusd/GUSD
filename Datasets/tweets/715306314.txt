@Sammy_Socialite Try following the law so you won't get pulled over.  Makes the roads safer for everyone.  Understand?
@TheRealLaRai Yeah Rai Rai:  Doesn't make sense to try to make the roads safer. You break all of the laws because you are above the law.  You drive only in the left lane with many cars behind you (#slowpokelaw). Plus many others. Your limited vocabulary starts with the letter "f". SAD!
@13photog_carlos Carlos: You and I both know that this #handsfreelaw will be enforced just like the #slowpokelaw.  Not at all.  Both are necessary.
@doseofkay Just like any other law, if you follow them then you won't get pulled over. Then you will have an opportunity for follow instructions or not.  My opinion is that you won't follow instructions.
@doseofkay This is the reason for the #handsfreelaw in GA. https://t.co/cf96E78Moi

@Canderson012 Cason, so you are the person driving slow (#slowpokelaw) in the passing lane and texting on your phone at the same time (#handsfreelaw). Neither will be enforced, you will be okay.
@KarsonBrownn Okay Karson, don't drive.  Just kidding, most other people will ignore it too without penalty. Just like the #slowpokelaw is rarely enforced.  You probably cruise in the passing lane too right?
@GAFolIowers @GAstatePolice The GA hands free law will be enforced just like the #slowpokelaw.  Not at all.
@camerondbradley Nope, it won't happen.  #slowpokelaw isn't enforced in GA.

@A1CSmitty2 Evan:  You must be in Georgia.  I was going through Atlanta and the same thing happened to me.  The lady drove for miles and finally decided to exit, TO THE RIGHT, and had to move five lanes to the right in about 100 yards.  Happens often in GA.
@ISPVersailles @GAstatePolice Sgt. Wheeles:  Contact your colleagues in the State of Georgia to start enforcing their Slowpoke Law.  We now have a Hands-Free Law that needs to be enforced too.

@GAstatePolice @MaconBibb Georgia has a slowpoke law too but it isn't enforced.  We now have a Hands-free law too and it won't be enforced either.  You can come through Georgia and drive "any kind of way" without penalty. Oh, many of our cars don't have blinkers. https://t.co/K0dJrhKW8R

@SEC Belk Bowl is in no hurry to finish.  There are 10 players left, five from each side, that hasn't initiated an injury timeout.  They all surely will get their personal airtime.
@13wmaznews I saw this on the news and said they had about three people on camera but no mention of their gender, race, height, etc.
@AggieFootball @WakeFB I'm watching the Belk Bowl on @espn and Texas A&amp;M and Wakeforest are setting a record injury timeouts.  All of the players are returning like nothing ever happened.  Seems like each player is getting personal air time.  Not a coincidence.
@CowboysNews365 Garrett needs more than players.
No offensive game plan. No use of mismatches. No accountability. Garrett is a puppet &amp; players know it. Fear is a good motivator but none in Dallas since Jimmy. Parcells wasn't allowed &amp; why he left. Enough is enough. @dallascowboys  @NFL @NFLonFOX @espn
