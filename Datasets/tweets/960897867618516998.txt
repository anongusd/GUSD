The problem with America is our education system sucks. We have a large volume of people who have not reached adulthood because of our school system. A school system designed to babysit produces babies not young adults. Now they are voting and now you see the consequences. Trump.
To fund these three types of school systems I would get rid of the U.S. Postal Service. We can sell all assets to mail service companies. We don't need walls we need education. The lack of education is what fills your prison system. Our children come first.
This is what no child left behind looks like. Different schools to accommodate the problem of teaching and learning. We are the adults, children don't fail school we fail at teaching the child. A child can work their way back to regular school. Consequences for your actions.
Our children come first above all things. School is not a place for babysitting. It a place where our children can become young adults. They need the proper setting for this to happen. If they start to fail then they are sent to a different type of school so they don't fail.

@FoxNews @HeyTammyBruce @BarackObama @realDonaldTrump When money is passed blaming someone else in court will not work. Fox News needs to try to spin something else. If money was passed either way between Fox News and Trump and not reported Fox will be in court too.
@LeeRummage @FoxNews @SenBlumenthal Democracy is about the world so much so those who want to end it attacked the Democratic Party not the Republican Party. Where do you stand is the bottom line, for Democracy or the Republican Party. The Republicans are leaning towards a dictatorship clearly.
@CNN Too late the stench of the Republican Party caused by Trump is too putrid. The Republican Party is the swamp. Time to empty it. Vote Democrat!
@ABC Putin needs to be impeached! Step up Russia.
@FoxNews You can't spin your way out of this. You are only spinning yourselves in deeper. The majority of the world does not believe Fox News. What are you doing? What is your purpose? It's clearly not the news. This makes you a part of this scandal. Stop.
@VP @SecNielsen @DHSgov @POTUS You can't even secure our elections. The people on the other side of the boarder are not our enemy you are. The enemy is in the Whitehouse and they need to be stopped. They are trying to spin the attention away from themselves. Their only concern for the wall must be money.
@FoxNews @SenBlumenthal Like the President, Republicans only care about themselves.
@thehill You can't run and you can't hide you can only spin. Those who see the writing on the wall need to come forward and confess. It's over.
@thehill The more women in position of power the better. Not just for our country but for the world. It will all change for the better when females no longer feel the need to step into a man's shoes and carve out a new wave of order. The female perspective is what this world needs.
RT @thehill: "Kirsten Gillibrand is exactly the kind of 2020 candidate Democrats need" https://t.co/4pGf2Ef4E2 https://t.co/9XR9H7g2ax
@Stop_Trump20 Trump only cares about himself and he has pulled together others like him who stand for nothing other than themselves. Together they finally mean something and is why they can't let go. Only caring about yourself is a sickness that has become widespread in our country.
@BBCNews @BritGeoSurvey When the ice caps melt and the distribution of weight shifts too quickly big earthquakes will be coming. I bet volcanos are next that will put us into an ice age.
RT @WIRED: "In their darkest hour, the Parkland students have taken up the fight for truth. May the rest of us have the sense to join them,‚Ä¶
@FoxNews @seanhannity Money Hannity, money was passed to the traitors you are trying to protect. What does that make You? You can't spin your way out of this. In the end you will cry like a little baby and tell everyone how sorry you are to keep your job. You suck!
@nytimes They only look the other way when they are molesting children.
@thehill He needs to be impeached along with Trump. Time for Russia to step up.
RT @RedTRaccoon: Mitt Romney has officially announced his run for the Utah Senate seat.		Let's get behind and support his Democratic oppone‚Ä¶
@thehill He is such a creep.
@NBCNews What about them helping Nazis escape to south America for profit. They should be made to pay that back with interest to all victims.
@nowthisnews They are angry and should be. When is enough, enough? This needs to stop at all cost. F your wall! This is more important.
@thehill He needs to be locked up while he waits for court.
@FoxNews @kayleighmcenany @TheDemocrats @BernieSanders Spinning this is not going to work in the end. Money was passed to the traitors and they can't hide from that. The same as Trump can't hide from money passed to silence his whore.
@wokeluisa Now it's going to heat up. Panic mode will have these fools bouncing off the walls. Nobody at Fox News will get any sleep. They will need to find a way to spin their way out of this.
@FoxNews @dbongino Wait, wasn't the Russian attack on our election a hoax yesterday? Now we should believe a President who can't tell the truth or a news station who can't tell the truth. Go away, you are an embarrassment.
@FoxNews So he doesn't follow it and now he's going to overhaul it and all he had to do was follow it. Another spin job by the WH and Fox News. History is going to chew you up and spit you out so more people over time can hate you. You will never be able to live this down ever.
@RealDeb18 @MaddowBlog Me too.
@iamyuneek @MaddowBlog Got to love her.
@MaddowBlog @JoyAnnReid Maddow is a true hero, her heart and soul is in her work. She is a defender of our democracy, our freedom. She is one of the reasons why a dictator can't be a dictator here. She is the opposite of Fox News. Thank you Rachel!
@DavidCornDC @JoyAnnReid Why is Fox News all in on covering up what obviously happened? There may be a bigger story here.
@hardball @SusanPage The hoax is Trump trying to be a President.
@chrislhayes How do incompetent people like this make it to the top, oh I know you vote for them. STOP!
@FoxNews @mschlapp Fox News is a joke.
@FoxNews We need to see how the information was passed on first.
@FoxNews @GOPChairwoman @TeamCavuto Try to sell that one in court. We will see the guilty in prison no pardon this time.
@thehill You mean by taking the FBI seriously. Why are they still in the Whitehouse?
@JoyAnnReid @DevinNunes Just don't give him any paperwork! What a scumbag.
@FoxNews @JudgeJeanine And we need to silence Fox News the hub for the Republicans and the NRA.
@wokeluisa I  believe 48 went to prison over Watergate. I believe more will go this time as treason casts a large shadow. We are under attack by another country those in position need to step up or be considered a traitor.
@CNN Call them out!
@FoxNews It won't be from the Republican Party.
@MuskieRuskie @Dan_Bongina @zstarbird @FoxNews @JudgeJeanine https://t.co/Zt9o5p44vA
@nowthisnews Yes, call these traitors out! This is a war against guns and those who profit off the sale of them. This is a war to keep our children safe at all costs.
@zstarbird @bballTFB @FoxNews @JudgeJeanine All gun owners should get a mental evaluation every 5 years at their expense. Your right ends when you are no longer deemed sane. This you will need to prove every 5 years.
@zstarbird @bballTFB @FoxNews @JudgeJeanine I understand it is outdated. We could not stand up to the sophistication of our military with the over the counter weapons we can buy. You are selling false political values at the expense of our children and calling it a right. This is shameful.
@thehill Didn't see that coming. ü§£
@thehill " Where have all the children gone while the Republicans sing the same ole song, long time passing."
@FoxNews @tedcruz And Republicans defend the NRA.
@CNN Another bought soul.
@zstarbird @FoxNews @JudgeJeanine Oh, so the Republicans are to blame.
@AuthorKimberley @realDonaldTrump He also said he could gun down someone in the street and his followers will still follow. He may not protect us from Russia will they still follow as our children are gunned down in our schools and he does nothing?
@thehill No not that, Republicans don't want to forfit funding from the NRA. How could they get the hillbilly vote without supporting the NRA? Break out the flowers and shovels the R in NRA stands for Republican.
@FoxNews @SteveScalise @IngrahamAngle I think you just did.
@FoxNews @JudgeJeanine Yeah, teachers should have guns, and maybe certain kids should have guns. No wait, all kids should have guns. We all should have guns! All hail the NRA! Thanks Fox News! Guns are the answer.
@NBCNews Except for gun control, cause well kids that has to do with money. We all know what the president will do for money. So go to school and study like it is your last day on earth cause it maybe. You can thank mom and dad on how they vote.
@FoxNews @TuckerCarlson Unbelievable, the right wing is so far up the NRA's a$$ they will sell their soul on Fox News and the souls of our children. Have they no honor, its as if they pulled the trigger themselves.
@Reuters I have always wanted to buy a Henry rifle, the silver addition. I am not going to after this. I would trade all the guns in the world to bring these children back. How many children need to die to feed the gun making machine. Does it need to be your child to feel this way?
@CNN For the Republicans to use this tragic, horrible act as a political ploy is who they are. They only care about themselves and how they can take advantage to promote their personal position. Republicans suck!
@NBCNews As his own mental state is in question. And what of those who expect this President to do the right thing?
@CNNTonight @CNN Nothing will happen and more children will die and you will go on with your life. History will note the role you did not play.
@FoxNews @jasoninthehouse And?
@tracey196348 @4YrsToday @kyungkarenmend1 @realDonaldTrump Little boys with their toys wanting to rule the world. Not only vote Democrat vote Female Democrat. Men have done enough damage a time for change.
@NBCNews And?
@thehill @Olivia_Beavers This Republican run Congress, I don't think so. They do not support the truth only their agenda which is lie your way to the top. This needs to stop vote Democrat.
@wokeluisa Our gun rights are so we can overthrow a government that is ruled by tyrants. This is outdated as our military is far more sophisticated than the weapons we could possibly own. These rights mean nothing compared to our children.
@nytimes Krickie!
@CNN The dumb House run by Republicans.
@nytimes Trump will need to make a dictator move to stay out of trouble. He should not have been allowed to be President. He only won the Electoral college delegate's vote. The Electoral college delegates needs to go away.
@theresamarbles Who allows this?
@NBCNews People who run for public office should be checked for mental illness. People who buy guns should too, every five years. If you own a gun prove you are sane enough to own one. It's only a right if your right.
@cnni When is enough, enough? This needs to stop.
@FoxNews It's an accumulation of problems. The child, the family, the easy access to guns, the school system. As a society we can only fix two, the easy access to guns and our school system. The family must come forward on its own, the child needs to be reported by others or themselves.
@wokeluisa @realDonaldTrump This is so sad.
@washingtonpost Isn't that now a prerequisite to work at the White House. People who tell the truth are hated by those who lie.
@wokeluisa They won't because they need the hillbilly vote to stay in office
@NBCNews Pence in the dark again?
@wokeluisa @realDonaldTrump New school system
@NBCNews It's not guns its the education system.
@FoxNews We need to invest in a new school system that ends this type of violence and helps end the high population in prison.
@thehill Treason
@CNN There should be public schools, then there should be all male and all female schools in uniform, then military boarding schools. We need to teach our children to be responsible for their actions first. If they can't fit in they move to the other school system.
@wokeluisa We not only need to study the person who commits mass murder, we need to study the family as well.	We need to constantly talk in the media to the next mass murderer for them to seek help. 	School systems need to change to teach children they are responsible for their actions.
@Crazyginny She's getting paid more.
@CNN And we believe him, why?
@wokeluisa She should have been paid more to be with that Pig.
@NBCNews There will be a parade when Trump is impeached!
@wokeluisa What does it take to get Trump impeached? Never again, FBI background checks for anyone running for public office.
@NBCNews So dumb, Congress needs to make it a crime to lie to the Press.
@tracey196348 @ChrisJZullo @crypticcat Those who follow feed the corruption. Trump appeals to those who only care about themselves. He is their poster child.
@thehill And who's not trying to stop them?
@NBCNews Congress needs to make it a crime to lie to the press.
@washingtonpost How did Trump get security clearance?
@PaulStewartII Ok, Congress needs to make it a crime to lie to the press.
@CNN Allegedly???
@lauriecrosswell We are under attack by another country! Not preventing it is treason.
@DevinNunesMom Your his mom? Spank him and send him to his room! What a creepy son.
@thehill How many times have we the tax payer paid for their misconduct? They should pay the money back! Why is this not a crime?
@thehill Wait, what? Not chain immigration!
@thehill We don't have to be at war to have a traitor, we only need to be under attack.
@FoxNews @AmbJohnBolton Sounds like Fox News
@CNN A lawyer who would pay 130k of his own money on a unicorn while jumping the Grand Canyon.
@CNN Wonder what's in his closet?
@NBCNews It's hard to find a man to share the load of work and family responsibilities.
@thehill Maybe he was instructed not to. That's what it looks like.
@GrnEyedMandy Fox News sings the motto of the Republican Party " Anything they think is wrong makes them right." Even if they are wrong.
@thehill I hope Jesus tells him to jump off a cliff!
@AlamoOnTheRise The only reason he is still here is because there needs to be a case against all three, Trump, Pence, and Sessions or they will pardon themselves out of trouble.
@FoxNews @POTUS Then why is Trump systematically trying to undue what a black President achieved at all cost just because he was black
@WalshFreedom Yes, why? The subject has been declassified.
@krassenstein I call Jeff "Smiley" because of his stupid smile. I think he is smiling because he believes a pardon will come his way.
@thehill Trump is a spoiled 8 year old and like his whore he is bought and paid for.
@BuzzFeedNews Black is beautiful!
@gmw3751 @FoxNews @seanhannity @WattersWorld Wait, what? No
@thehill Good
@thehill Trump is a revolution waiting to happen
@nytimes Trump shouldn't have clearance
@AntonioParis Not without proper preparations
@FoxNews @alanmendoza And the Right is not mentioned because it would be a laugh.
@CNN When Trump gets impeached Pence  and smiles will need to go too or who ever is left will pardon the others.
@ABC Ha, she walked into a punch.
@thehill We just want to know of the many who will vote to impeach now!
@nikkihaley Too bad he believes in arranged marriage. Like his music
@DeniseM52134343 @tracey196348 @realDonaldTrump There needs to be lie limit, too many and your out.
@washingtonpost Trumphood "Take from the poor and give to the Rich"
@Reuters The rich only care about the rich.
@wokeluisa Not true
@washingtonpost Because there is only one truth which Trump does not seem fit to honor.
@FoxNews @PressSec Even if they have to lie about it.
@wokeluisa Let's build a wall in a drone era where a boy made a drone out of a bathtub and flew to town to by donuts.
@wokeluisa Maybe it is truth dust? Just saying
@FoxNews Sure it isn't Fox News trying to dig up meaningless trash.
@thehill Maybe we should make them wear I's on their shirts. Just saying
There should be a limit to how many lies a person in public office can tell the American people before they need to step down. Do not use her as an example she has gone way beyond what is tolerable. https://t.co/i7lS9vbTOi
@cnni Just as long as she doesn't steal our freedom. Just saying.
@FoxNews @seanhannity @WattersWorld Spreading lies as if it were news should be a crime.
@FoxNews @dbongino They can't run from Fox fake News. Hmmm.
@realDonaldTrump I don't he wrote this.
@wokeluisa @tracey196348 They will need to make a series after Trump is gone to feed our appetite.
@FoxNews @newtgingrich @MariaBartiromo I bet he would be in jail too. Just need to dig a little.
@SenFeinstein This subject has been declassified Trump has no right to block any other memo on the subject.
@mayday2020 He declassified it when he declassified the first one.
@_etgeeee_ @SenFeinstein The subject has already been declassified so it is ok to leak.
@Reuters You mean he is waiting to see what Fox News wants him to do.
@CNN How did Trump get security clearance???
@FoxNews @ChrisStirewalt @WhiteHouse You mean it's not fake News! I'm shocked Fox.
Lawrence is cool but wrong on this one. You don't have to be at war from another country just under attack. If you are an American and help you are a traitor.		Lawrence: What Donald Trump doesn't know about treason https://t.co/4SEqPQG9jm via @NBCNews
