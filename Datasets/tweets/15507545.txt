@rocrmsc @dandc @olopez4 @alishafoo Tie between Carnival of Curiosity and Geek Chic Prom. Haven't missed one since the Carnival theme.
@alishafoo @dandc @olopez4 It does provided some good insight, but I think we can get better data as a city.
@dandc @olopez4 @alishafoo The @rocRMSC After Hours events have been one of my favorite events added to the area within the last few years.
@dandc @olopez4 @alishafoo What was the demographics of the Monroe 200? Was it a true cross section of Rochesterians?

@DavidLSchafer Looking for either one. Feel free to send anything my way :)
@DavidLSchafer RoR, Sass, Javascript, or analytics/business intelligence. So either front end or back end.
@TiRochester Will apply, but looking for a position that isn't senior.
@DougStrouth Would have to do remote. Living in Rochester now.
Note to self: never look for web developer jobs on rochester's craigslist again.
@GordonDiggs Thanks. That would explain a ton.

@binarymn Email hosts@barcamproc.com or tweet at @devmorgan about it. I don't have access to the website.
So Congress is the problem. Wait, that's the election that not enough people are paying attention. Learn about your reps! #PrezD2012
The ongoing debate between Federal vs State powers. A debate that has existed since the birth of our nation and will continue onwards.
@tonybgoode @noneck It's going to be a great 4 weeks. Thanks to you both for organizing/hosting this event. #PrezD2012
What did Jim Lehrer say to Clint Eastwood after his RNC speech next to the empty chair? Sit on it!
I highly recommend people checkout http://t.co/EXBDYByY as they watch the debate. Tons of background information on the candidates #SunLive.
At @nwc for the first debate. Going to be an awesome night. #PrezD2012
@sela_davis Probably not till 7:20. Usually don't leave work till 7.
@DougStrouth Truth.
@thoughtpunch Sounds awesome! Keep me in the loop if you do end up starting a meetup around it.
@thoughtpunch I would be interested in joining, but I'm not in the industry. Just work on tools on the side.
@sela_davis I'm sure one of those will work. I'll actually will be by @nwc tomorrow evening. Great choice on working out of there today.
RT @RITGCCIS: @BarCampRoc on Saturday! Get those presentations done! #RIT #ROC
@sela_davis I work in Chelsea on West 25, but I live in Brooklyn. Drinks might be possible depending on when you are having dinner.
@sela_davis Wait, that means that you are in NYC. Care to meet up later tonight?
So the person who cut my hair last night and I have different defs of what I meant by short. Lets see how many people don't recognize me.
@tristan Let me know if you want to go out for one. They are a bit spicier than the ones in Rochester, but the owners get Roc ingredients.
@tristan @RedWolves I'll be doing the same when visiting for @barcamproc. Btw, you can get garbage plates in NYC. Look for Daddy-Os.
@noneck Looking forward to the broadcast on Wednesday.

@worr Nice. Listened to the album this morning at work.
@worr Which version? I like the longer version she did for Occupy This Album.
@GordonDiggs Dude!
@emilyokey That is practically my neighborhood. I'm in the Columbia Street Waterfront area. You should visit sometime!
@emilyokey Murray's is amazing. I tend to go at least once a month.

@MatthewRay @JennaKempie Thanks!
Starting to explore the Waterfront area now that I live here. The view is really worth it.
@amg6763 It was really heavy and annoying to put together, but well worth it.
@JennaKempie Started working at @paperlesspost in June. Been here for the past month and a half, but finally have my own place now.
@mattBernius Miss everyone in Rochester too. The visualization is going slowly as I've been busy planning the move. Back to it soon though.
@amg6763 One of the huge box shelves. Was a pain to put together, but well worth it. Probably will end up buying more from there.
Bed put together. Time for the 5x5 box shelf from Ikea.
Internet finally set up! Now to start unpacking and putting things together.
Time Warner came at the same time as the movers. Ikea on their way. Busy as all out.
Movers are here!
Working on the initial cleaning. My hands are going to smell like cleaning solution for a week.

I'm sorry @JetBlue for how people are treating some of your people here at JFK due to all the delays. #KeepCoolAndCarryOn
I'm the only one with a laptop out. Kinda surprised. At least I'm ready in case @JetBlue gives the signal if the flight gets canceled.
Boarding now delayed till 2:15am. Now this is becoming an adventure. However, already have a ride set up due to the midnight Batman showing.
Flight has been delayed twice. Current boarding time is 11:15. They just made us switch gates with the flight to Syracuse. Long night.
Starting another round trip between NYC and Rochester. This should be the final one for moving though.

On yet another round trip to Rochester. This time to pack everything I want to move to NYC and clean the apartment.
@adrian_yablin This can only be seen as good news. Might have to do viewings at my new place once I move in. Where are you in the series?
Officially going back to Rochester this weekend to pack for the eventual (2 weeks or so) moving to Brooklyn.
Quiz night at The Way Station!
Waiting for a notary at the bank. Already feels like a long morning but will be well worth it if everything goes through ok.

@robotfilmfest Best news I've heard all day. Thanks!
@robotfilmfest Any hints on when tickets will be on sale? I would love to go again after such an awesome time last year.
Missing out on #PDF12 but had an awesome time at #pdfapplied. Hope to attend the hackathon again next year.
Wish that there was just a few more hours before having to present the projects at #pdfapplied.
Best time to discover this lack of settings, is at a hackathon when working on a project.
Turns out that when I used Time Machine to revive my settings/data, it didn't transfer over git, and my other programming settings.
Had an awesome time at the @barcampnyc's party last night. Now at #pdfapplied. Just made it in time for opening remarks.
So it looks like I have my night free again. I'm thinking of heading to the @BarCampNYC pre-party in just a few.
@Jmontois340 The book is actually really good. It was hard to put down. Highly recommend it. Kinda weary about the movie though.
Turns out the apartment I was going to check out was the one I saw yesterday under a different title. Instead, I went to @thewaystation.
I guess I should be more specific. I'm getting tired of landlords lying about how many rooms an apartment has.
Well there goes my plans for this evening. Well better this evening than tomorrow. Getting tired from apartment searching.
Remembering how much I love food in NYC.Getting smoked Canadian Jewish deli at the Mile End.

I have the oddest feeling that someone in my family will mention plastics today. #RITGrad #TheGraduate
Better hashtags for #RITGrad: #DontPanic #Surrealism #BearsFinalFourUmbrellas
Almost forgot that #RITGrad was on #TowelDay. I feel like there is some symbolism there, but I rather not go down that direction.
Couldn't really sleep. So weird thinking that graduation is today and that I'll be moving to NYC sometime in the next two weeks. #RITGrad
Turns out my original CS advisor, Leanne, is on my flight back to Rochester. Was awesome catching up before #RITGrad
As my seat was assigned at the gate, I get first row. Woo!
Heading back to JFK. That had to be my shortest trip to NYC. At least I will be back in the next two weeks.
Well today wasn't very successful in finding an apartment. At least I was able to look in person once before graduating.
Realtor asks what ill be doing in NYC. Mention web dev. He brings up this idea for an app he wants to create. #JustSayNo

Another awesome #tcamp12! Thanks @elle_mccann @sunfoundation and everyone else who helped out. Already looking forward to next year's event.
@bensheldon I'll be right there. Plus, popsicles.
@bensheldon Are you still at #tcamp12? Briefly met you earlier but haven't really gotten to talk you yet today.
#OpenPicnic was one of the best sessions at #tcamp12.

Sick this morning. Balls that I have to miss #TEDxRochester. Sickness has been hitting me at the worst of times. #lousy #day
People in the apartment above me are having huge dance party. There goes my hope for getting work done tonight. #Week10 #Doom
Taking a break from writing papers for #RIThockey.
@chorn I would not mind having a second day of @BarCampRoc. However, I think we would need a ton more volunteers in order to save ourselves.
Another @BarCampRoc gone and past. Now to catch up on school work and everything else.
@bgriffin04 Come up to the front desk and we can help you out.
Been a very busy morning so far at @BarCampRoc. However, everything has been running smoothly.

Within 24 hours @BarCampRoc will be on its way. So much to do between now and then.

This totally made my day. MT: @BarCampRoc We have 200 people registered for BarCamp Rochester! Are you excited? We are!
@devmorgan @SteveStreza it was #CSHer too.
@chorn @devmorgan 261 really seems stretching it. I thinking attendance will be around 220.
@devmorgan You should renew your wedding vows to @BarCampRoc.
Look out for people in back allays offering coat cheese.
My #TEDxRochester ticket came in. Woo!
This game has been painful to watch. Can't wait for our normal goalie to come back. #RITHockey.
@devmorgan The email out to all @RITGCCIS went out today. Thats why the sudden jump.
.@devmorgan It would be awesome if we could get 200 people to show up to @BarCampRoc.
Its amazing how well I can hear the corner crew though WITR's feed of #RITHockey.
@devmorgan How many people are at the game tonight?
@devmorgan @chorn They are making phone calls this morning on if its possible. I ended up talking with the head of event registration.
@chorn I'm currently on my way to confronting them for the second time in person. Will let you know the result by 10.
For the first time this week I'm not feeling sick. Woo! Not to catch up on everything...
@devmorgan Any guesses on how many people will sign up to attend @BarCampRoc before the event?
RT @RITGCCIS: @RITGCCIS, have you registered to @BarCampRoc today? http://t.co/5bCqJbfa #RIT #ROC
I love you #RITHockey! Most epic game I've seen.

@BarCampRoc Whatever it is, I bet it smells worse on the inside.

I disappear for 2 hours for class and find out afterwards that I've been volunteered to be tattooed to the highest sponsor for @BarCampRoc.

Gave in and finally got a MacBook Air. Now for the long process of setting everything up and transferring files.
Back to JFK and then to Rochester.
Meant to say that I had my last drink at @waystationbk. Going to miss the place. If only there was a similar bar in Rochester.
Had one last drink at @thewaystation while watching the last half of Blink. Hope to go back there someday.
So one last weekend in NYC. Already have plans for Sunday. Any recommendations on how to spend my last Saturday here?
Last day working at @ppolitics on @open_gov and @OpenCongress. Its been a long but satisfying summer working there.
