@zackseward @acoppa @MaikenScott Glory days.
@Dan_UA @Avi_WA @PaCrossroads Appreciate the back and forth, Dan. We get your pov. And I think you get ours.
@Dan_UA @Avi_WA @PaCrossroads I'm all for a story that examines other options for how to bridge divide between those who want full implementation and those who feel current implementation is already too painful. But that wasn't this story.
@Dan_UA @Avi_WA @PaCrossroads Because that's what you need to add to the pot in order to fully use the formula without cutting any district. Again, I get your proposal is a lot more reasonable than that.... But thats not the idea Wolf discussed.
@Dan_UA @Avi_WA @PaCrossroads We are not using outliers. We are not overstating. We are reporting on what the governor said. You seem to think that we should guess he means what you want him to mean.
@Dan_UA @Avi_WA @PaCrossroads To be very clear: not our proposal.
@Dan_UA @Avi_WA @PaCrossroads Your quibble here seems to be with the Wolf administration.
@Dan_UA @Avi_WA @PaCrossroads Or, as the governor's administration told the AP, you could run all money through the formula--including the $5.5 billion base -- and reach a point where no district would be hurt. We ran the math on what that would take, and got a fact-based answer.
@Dan_UA @PaCrossroads @Avi_WA What you are calling for isn't really a formula distribution ‚Äî as the formula is designed to be applied to ALL districts. You are saying the logic of the formula should be used to make a different policy decision. That's fine. But it's not what the governor has been saying.
@Dan_UA @PaCrossroads @Avi_WA And to be clear, Wolf isn't calling for a $32 billion increase. He says he supports a full formula implementation when funding is "full, fair and adequate," which he didn't define.
@Dan_UA @PaCrossroads @Avi_WA Dan, this really doesn't make sense. If you add 1.7 billion and run in through the formula, it would bring the total formula distribution to about 29%. The 32 billion number is not a red herring. It is fact based math based upon something an elected official said.

@Haver_Lisa But that was in there too right?
@Haver_Lisa @PaulSocolar Yeah, that was all well covered by local press. My issue with article was mostly about description of present.
@PaulSocolar Journalism would give those competing narratives a voice. Maybe I just shouldn't be expecting that from Answer Sheet.
@PaulSocolar And remember we're talking abt a context where, district put out RFPs for 3 schools. 4 applied. 1 deemed unable. 1 dropped out.
@PaulSocolar Get yr point, but surely macro level effects are smaller at neighborhood-based charter than otherwise, right?
@PaulSocolar To me, this isn't a district/charter issue. No skl should be judged w/o going through obvious/necessary journalistic process.
@carolburris will do, but not immediately. Out with family now.
@carolburris I wrote many stories last year about process. I know Robin and Kenya well, was at her house, waited with her with kids for bus.
@carolburris You were a principal right? If I wrote a story like this about yr school and said: Superintendent didn't respond, wouldn't fly.

The more news sources blur that line, the easier it becomes for people to write off anything that doesn‚Äôt immediately confirm their bias.
There‚Äôs often errors made when doing the former. The latter looks a lot like ideological hackery.
Maybe some think that line is blurred to the point that anything goes. I don‚Äôt. Either yr relentlessly pursuing the truth, or yr not.
It‚Äôs often hard to tell if The Answer Sheet is supposed to be journalism or aggregation and commentary.
This should infuriate everyone, especially educators ‚Äî no matter in district/charter/private. You know how you‚Äôd feel if it were your school
Of course: no current parents or staffers are quoted. No current data is cited. Yet judgement is made about the school.

@AmandaWorking @jenniferkates thanks!
@jenniferkates @AmandaWorking @PaulSocolar My understanding is that Clearinghouse produces proprietary data which comes at cost.
Would love to see how Pa's private school tax credits affect students. But those schools don't need to take state tests &amp; no data on kids. https://t.co/HAkqwUzD5V
My understanding is that this is no simple task. Would be great for Ed committee chairs to take the lead on getting data and making public.
Also can we have a discussion about statewide college going/completion rates that's rooted in data? I'm not aware of this info for all 500.
Also, for the record, many of Eichelberger's districts get more state $ per kid than Philly, Lancaster, Erie, Scranton and Wilkes-Barre.
Also: Eichelberger represents 22 school districts. Altoona is poorest and most urban. It gets less state $ per kid than most of his others.
Sen Eichelberger says coverage of his comments has been "fake news" spun by "liberal media outlets." A republican in attendance thought: https://t.co/llUGFOAgzg

@beth_patel If decisions haven't already been made, if @PhilaSchoolPart $ was influencing SRC decision, it would be a much different story.

@beth_patel All sides? Seems like you want your side in every story. I can't give that to @PhilaSchoolPart And I can't give that to you.

@CMcGeeIII @mr_saltz That was for CAP right?
My buddy Jeff went to Labrum...and now he's a doctor. SO I HATE THIS!
@mr_saltz @CMcGeeIII I enjoyed it.
SRC meeting is over!...but hearing on Labrum middle school closure just beginning...
SRC now must consider if it should adopt new charter for Community Academy of Philadelphia Charter...passes unanimously.
SRC votes to renew Ad Prima, Neff and Green dissent
Ad Prima vote back up.
Neff originally voted for renewal by accident to gasps of crowd, tipped hand for CAP charter renewal
Ad Prima renewal is tied as of now....Green No, Simms Yes, Neff No, Jimenez Yes, Houston can't be reached on phone.
SRC will now vote on resolutions, including renewals of Ad Prima and Community Academy of Philadelphia charter schools
Cade, former PFT member, calls for the feds to come in and takeover PSD...don't hear that at SRC everyday.
Devon Cade: "Many won't like what I have to say...PFT is part of the issue."
SLA counselor Hirschfield: District treats teachers as "villains in crisis created by state legislators."
Who needs to listen to testimony, when you can take a selfie!
Suddenly this SRC meeting just became a huge photo shoot...
Green assures kids at SRC from Cooke that "closing your school is not an option...there may be different teachers..."
Testifying now, Renita Brown, the woman who informed Cooke community location of meetings...when district didn't: https://t.co/jL0Q3homKi
Turner, Cooke grandparent: says he goes to school everyday. There's been improvement under 1st year principal. Wants SRC to give him chance
Cooke parent Clarke: "How do we set up our students for failure and then call them chronically underperforming."
Wister grandparent Gail Tarver: "You think that we do not deserve to make a decision about our children?"
Wister principal Smith: "I want to work with the same resources we had in 2008."
Holmes: "How can we follow your rules if you make them up as you go along."
Kenya Holmes: advocates for Wister to become a community school...doesn't hate charters, but "hates having her choice taken away."

Many Huey parents criticize district for not doing better job getting parents to meetings...district said it wanted them small by design
Radio reporters appreciate: If you are going to yell, don't do it right into the mic, unintelligible...no way that'll make it on the air.
Pam Williams, even after mic cut, won't stop testifying. "Huey will not be a charter school," she yells.
Pam Williams, from West Philly: "Our communities have been racially oppressed."
Tonya Bah: accuses SRC and @SDPHite of involuntary manslaughter? Wow.....
.Davenport of @source4teachers is a sneaky one...tried to catch him after testimony and security guard said he slipped down fire exit

@kforbriger Could only be more fun If only Mark G. was on the list.
BUT I CAME TO HEAR YOU TALK ABOUT THE DELL COMPUTER CONTRACT! @AmyRoatPFT
Note to speakers: Source 4 teachers is paid only for vacancies filled. $34M is not guaranteed.
Green: last 4 speakers put themselves above parents by testifying off topic...
We can't know if @Haver_Lisa is speaking about the right resolution...because it isn't published in handout.
SRC cuts off @Haver_Lisa mic...because she signed up to speak about resolution that was removed........?
Up soon, "concerned citizen" @AmyRoatPFT.
.@sgobreski wants more clarity about what district is doing to address staff shortages, vacancies, subs debacle
Many students testified to positive impacts of taking PSAT...district offered it for free for first time in years.
@CMcGeeIII I Gotcha.
Three students from @WorkshopSchool advocate for more project-based learning programs. https://t.co/FlcnID1RBg
@CMcGeeIII And there was justified skepticism....but only charters should face that?
@CMcGeeIII So you'd advocate for every district school to be evaluated and possibly shuttered every 5 years?
Lots of shouts and chants always interrupt beginning of SRC meetings. Never as loud by speaker 65.
Green skeptical about Ad Prima's pitch for charter renewal: ‚ÄúEverybody complies when they‚Äôre facing non-renewal‚Äù

.@MargeNeff votes against 10k contract with The New Teacher Project
.@Green4Philly : "until we have resources, we will continue to have to make decisions that aren't fair."
.@SDPHite its important to ask why district schools haven't helped minority children better learn to read and write.
.@SDPHite wants to rectify a few things: hasn't been a hiring freeze of nurses.
.@ronwhitehorne cites poor performance of ren charter operators Universal, Young Scholars, Mosaica, Aspira
.@sgobreski asks: "why don't you have your own model to turn around schools at this point?"
The man knows how to write: @gbezanis
Central history teacher @gbezanis rails against SRC for its reluctance to democracy.
Duckrey elementary parent, teacher and principal testifying about positive things going on at school since it received kids from closures
Wister prnt Kenya Nation wants reassurance that decisions being made in kid's best interest. She's open to charter,offended by lack of vote.
Cooke Parent Renita Brown reaches fever point of testimony: "Our children are not cattle."
Robin Roberts, of Parents United, says district is making ren charter decisions based on faulty data.
.@cohen4council15 implicitly accuses district of hoping to undermine its own schools...says new plan is way to push out union.
.@cohen4council15 asks SRC: "Do you respect parents?" Thinks not based on lack of ability on parents to vote for/against ren charter
Huey teacher Deanna Lewis says lack of resources and lack of "rigorous" PD has affected their ability to show better outcomes.
Parent Toya Algarin speaks glowingly of @KIPPphilly (they don't currently run a ren charter in Philly).
"My own experience has been an excellent one," says grandparent Moffit of ren charter @MasteryCharter Mann
Parent Elizabeth Moffit talks about having mind changed about renaissance initiative...school has changed greatly for the better, she says.
@CaucusofWE @Quibila Could be. But @Quibila has been saying this stuff long before Sylvia was on SRC.
.@Quibila : "let's stop the adult bickering and political posturing"
Parent Dukobi Stays says Aspira doing a great job at Stetson ren charter.
Crowd demands SRC speak on lack of nurses. Panel won't bite.
Tchr Regina Feighan-Drach testifies abt 2nd grdr who passed out at skl last week, saved by nurse. Lucky it was a monday, only day she's in.
Wister teacher Robin Lowry criticizes district for 10k contract with The New Teacher Project that would have them prescreen new principals
.@Haver_Lisa says office of "family engagement" should change name to "family exclusion."

.@jerrytjordan getting big applause from crowd, chanting "PFT"
Some very emotional testimony from parent Terron Brown about importance of alt ed programming for his child.
A great legacy of @Green4Philly's SRC chairmanship: students now always get to speak 1st. Was a disaster for kids in past on packed nights.
Based on survey: Parents and students perceive their neighborhoods to be safer than teachers and principals at both district &amp; charter skls
The mic system is back up! Tonya Wolford now giving results of last spring's school surveys.
This CTE presentation is one of most engaging I've seen at SRC. Actually nice to have somebody up and working the room sans mic.
Right now, local shipyard has 55 unfilled welding positions...District is working to get those jobs to CTE grads
Which journalistic outlet recently devoted a whole paper to #phled CTE programing? Of course, it's @PSNotebook http://t.co/weJw5JanZQ
Grad rates at CTE programs dwarf district averages.
The district's CTE presentation continues sans microphones...speaker was a former HS principal...used to addressing large groups w/o mic
Crowd fills the silence by chanting "Hite must go." For a second there I thought they were saying "microscope"
District is having technical difficulties. District spokesman says he thinks the amp that powers microphone system has blown.
.@SDPHite gives a wry smile when bringing up @Source4Teachers contract. They are "on notice," he says, "This won't go on indefinitely."
Many from the crowd call: "let the parents vote" re: proposed renaissance charter conversions
.@SDPHite acknowledges the role of funding shortfalls in schools he wants to affect with plan...but says schools still need a new approach
My goal tonight is to tweet the same thing as @ChroniclesofSol and @newskag at exactly the same time. #journalism

@kforbriger @JonathanCetel And I impeded that how? By afterwards giving people accurate info that to that point hadn't been made clear?

@kforbriger I have a feeling you wouldn't be saying that if all parents were on board.

@KWagsWoodward @kforbriger You can disagree with premise about charters...as will unions about pensions.
@KWagsWoodward @kforbriger They have two cost drivers that they'd like to see reformed. I don't see any red herrings.

@kforbriger @kevinptrainer @KWagsWoodward He'd argue that they don't though, that it's not a one to one.
@kforbriger @kevinptrainer @KWagsWoodward 3) he didn't use "stranded cost," but said B-hem taxpayers pay a $15 mill "cost of school choice."
@kforbriger @kevinptrainer @KWagsWoodward 2) If all came back to BASD (assuming hiring 1 tchr for each 25 kids) it'd cost them $5 million.
@kforbriger @kevinptrainer @KWagsWoodward 1) He says they spend $20 million on charters. About 1,600 kids there attend them.

@kforbriger @kevinptrainer @KWagsWoodward not saying this is predominant factor, just nuance worth recognizing
@kforbriger @kevinptrainer @KWagsWoodward which then adds to cost district must send to charter. hypothetically, even 0 growth cld cost more
@kforbriger @kevinptrainer @KWagsWoodward not exactly...if charters have more mildly disabled, district average cost rises...

@benspeicher @KWagsWoodward @kforbriger Based on my non-scientific observation (having grown up there).
@benspeicher @KWagsWoodward @kforbriger Def not true in Nicetown...but in NE Philly, migration from catholics to charters is very prevalent
@kforbriger @benspeicher @KWagsWoodward Schools need strong principals. There should be more admin autonomy. Utilization rate too low.
Budgets are priorities. That's why City Council is hyper-focused on..... cursive handwriting.
@benspeicher @KWagsWoodward @kforbriger Very well could be true...but there's points in BCG that no one blinks at...but def wrong here?

Odd that @JimFKenney campaign email asking for $ highlights police, fire, labor endorsement, but not teachers.
@kforbriger @benspeicher good q. You'd think the economy of scale would secure better price....but wouldn't doubt that things go wrong
@benspeicher @kforbriger I don't doubt it. Not saying they couldn't have done better. Just seems to me the context is important.
@kforbriger @benspeicher you don't think exacerbated by closures and migration?
@benspeicher certainly issues, but this seems clearly tied to 30 closures, tens of thousands of kids leaving district schools + recession

@kforbriger @kevinptrainer 2) what's the alternative? Admit defeat and burn them?
@kforbriger @kevinptrainer Purchased years ago with more students/different standards I'd guess...
@kevinptrainer New schools open/old schools close...lots of book inefficiencies in the mean time. Isn't that part&amp;parcel of portfolio model?
@kevinptrainer Is there a thing? I'm out of the loop if so?
@kevinptrainer So that's a good thing then, right? They are there for people to take.
@kevinptrainer Doesn't the push for curriculum aligned to state-standards make the "any book will do" argument kinda thin?
@kevinptrainer Left wondering: Are schools really in need of these books? Not a single principal or teacher (not anonymous) quoted in story.

Difference is that, despite waitlists, many already authorized seats remain unfilled. 1,300 was added projection in 5 yr plan, could go up.
To clarify: Philadelphia will have less authorized charter seats next year...but actually projecting for 1,300 added charter students 1 of 2

@by_CKennedy Ok...not seeing how that affects the #?
By 2018-19, assuming no more charter closures/openings, #phled would have 894 new charter seats. (3/3)
In 2016-17, even w/o any more charter closures, #phled will still have fewer charter seats than it began with this year, by 64 kids.
Facts to keep in mind based on last night's SRC: In 2015-16 #phled will have less charter seats than at start of this year. (1/?)

Proud to know all the fine folks on @whyyradiotimes who make this sort of great civil discourse about #phled possible. #pledgedrive
@kforbriger Can I throw a "what what" to all those who attend SRC meetings?
Don't miss today's @whyyradiotimes at 10am, where @PhilaSchoolPart and @pccyteam will talk their deeply divided views on charter expansion.
@kforbriger @BenjaminBHerold @CitifiedPHL If we're going to pull apart PSP's 2k (and we should)...we should do same for 7k.
@BenjaminBHerold @kforbriger @CitifiedPHL And think it's in the realm of possibility for district to better illustrate.
@BenjaminBHerold @kforbriger @CitifiedPHL Guess I'm just curious how accurate those assumptions are...
@BenjaminBHerold @kforbriger @CitifiedPHL Concrete figures based on a student who moved to charter school...with breakdown of costs
@BenjaminBHerold @kforbriger @CitifiedPHL This debate aside, it'd be helpful for the district to provide an upated real accounting of the 7k
@kforbriger @CitifiedPHL And what do I have to do to become "indefatigable"?
@WaltWeberJr Yes. Always does. The website has no limits, not so in radio programming.
@WaltWeberJr No, that was in there.
.@PhilaSchoolPart and @PhillyEducation come to wildly diff $ when calculating added costs of charter expansion: http://t.co/4RkHOY4FY7
District reax to PSP's $35 million: "We are are appreciative of the offer by PSP. The SRC will continue its rigorous review process..."
.@PhilaSchoolPart will give @PhillyEducation $25 million to help offset stranded costs of charter expansion...doesn't want $ to be excuse
