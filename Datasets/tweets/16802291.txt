Fewer than 1% of the world's 22.5 million refugees will be resettled. #WRD2018
The US Refugee Resettlement Program is a lifesaving, public-private partnership for #refugees with no other means of finding safety. #WRD2018
Fewer than 1% of the world's #refugees are ever resettled. #WRD2018
Since the passage of the Refugee Act of 1980, over 3 million #refugees have found safe haven in America. #RefugeesWelcome #WRD2018
The US has been a global leader in the protection of refugees and must continue to set an example as a safe haven. #WRD2018 #RefugeesWelcome
The number of #refugees and others forcibly displaced from their homes is over 65 million worldwide, the highest level since WWII #WRD2018
Every minute, 24 people are forced to flee their homes because of war or persecution. #RefugeesWelcome #WRD2018
42,500 people a day are forced to flee their homes because of conflict &amp; persecution. #WRD2018
51% of #refugees are under the age of 18. What if that was someone you know? #WRD2018
