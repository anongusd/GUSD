It sounds like a threat.  But i k ow it cant be because they are worthless on this forum.  Is that clearer.  What was it you were trying to say.  Or are you looking for the slightest provocation.
@realDonaldTrump @terrie_hawkins Really the problem is you cant understand walls in this day and age  are not as effective and considering its price and required resources.  Not to mention upkeep.
@Rick_Ames @FrankieCrypto @hogangidley45 @kayleighmcenany @POTUS The fact that he is at the white alone means by definition he is getting nothing done.  There would need to be people there to work with  to get things done.
@SheilaSaysSo @hogangidley45 @ClubSpeaks @POTUS They are.  They are reporting the news.  Trump as president is news.  The fact that he is at the white alone means by definition he is getting nothing done.  There would need to be people there to work with  to get things done.
@1AdoptedGeordie @hogangidley45 @RyanAFournier @POTUS Thats that side of the swamp.
@WVUFanPain @AmyMek Well you know we got tired of not blowing places up.
@realDonaldTrump No.  No there not. Once again the grifter president yells and screams because he cannot do what he says.  Cannot bring people together.  You are not good at this.  In fact you suck at it.
@sgtjanedoe Those books.

@RedPillBlack2 @wgary86 @realDonaldTrump Obama fixed it and put in place regulations so it would not happen again.  Those regulations have been removed by trump.  He is now governing the nation to another crash.  As for GDP.  He has not doubled it not even close.	https://t.co/psVGyuW0ec
@RedPillBlack2 @wgary86 @realDonaldTrump Ye he did.  Bush economics caused the crash.  I watched it happen.
@HogtownModerate @weathernetwork Lol graciously accepted
@RedPillBlack2 @wgary86 @realDonaldTrump Thats because Obama inherited a finatial crash from George.  Obama rebuilt the nations finaces.  Trump inherited that success and put the nation at risk of another crash.

@realDonaldTrump @RedPillBlack2 No calling out your lies is not dividing the country.  Or making things worse.  Your lies are aimed specifically at your trumpetes. By misinforming you play into there hatred.  By giving them a target to rage at your splitting up the country.    All for the gain of the rich.

@manny_ottawa @realDonaldTrump Its not fake news.
@manny_ottawa @realDonaldTrump They didnt root him out he came to them.  He was hiding his true identy.  He came forward as a descendent of hitler to put emphasis how much he hated trump or did miss that.
@manny_ottawa @realDonaldTrump Jumped on the bandwagon and so that you could use to besmearch and smear others.  You spread hatred and discord.  Instead of giving an opinion you have spewed your point to urge more hatred.  I say to you it is you who does not understand.  I gave you too much credit.
@manny_ottawa @realDonaldTrump Or that i have an issue bassed on something else and you are the one who totally missed.  Yes i may come off a liberal but have larger agenda here.  If you have truly read my bio.  You would known that.  I think that he should not have been brought by the media.  Then you.
@manny_ottawa @realDonaldTrump And all ive proven is that i have seen ehat you are trying to say and understand you are trying to create a hatred in others. No i understand just fine.  Your dissmisals of those you deem unwothy simply because they don't agree is lazy
@manny_ottawa @realDonaldTrump Again i understand i think your pretext is flimsy and frankly dissmisive.  It is you who hate.
@manny_ottawa @realDonaldTrump Uhuh your dissmissal only affect those you pander to.

@DrGreenThumb45 @BillieStelzner @Heathamommy @MollyRingwald They have paraded her around.  That does not make her allegation fake or illegitimate.  Her issues are independent of the politics here.
@DrGreenThumb45 @LindaWarriorGal @MollyRingwald Ugg the daily caller.  Can please come up with something more reliable.
@DrGreenThumb45 @BillieStelzner @Heathamommy @MollyRingwald Again i say totaly seperate issues.  You cannot use one to discount the other.

@DrGreenThumb45 @BillieStelzner @Heathamommy @MollyRingwald Yeah there is alot of doubt about the boyfriends statments
@DrGreenThumb45 @LindaWarriorGal @MollyRingwald The only rrason that i know that this has not been brougjt before a judge ia that the statue of limitations applies.  What kind of evidence are you accepting.
@DrGreenThumb45 @BillieStelzner @Heathamommy @MollyRingwald There is but alot of it is unreliable.  I thank you for sharing what you have.
@DrGreenThumb45 @BillieStelzner @Heathamommy @MollyRingwald Ok ill go back and watch the whole thing.  Im really curious about watching it with this in mind
@DrGreenThumb45 @LindaWarriorGal @MollyRingwald Yeah right up to the proverbial video tape.
@DrGreenThumb45 @LindaWarriorGal @MollyRingwald Im sorry.  But that is not the same thing is it.  It was proven in a court of law those who are impartial.  Not a bunch people who all have feelings and agendas
@DrGreenThumb45 @BillieStelzner @Heathamommy @MollyRingwald So that means she has no feeling or is lying or its just a con job.  Please you had the opinion and then you found things to justify it.  The articles are interesting and bare studie. I will check it out then i will make an opinion.  Ever evolving.
@DrGreenThumb45 @BillieStelzner @Heathamommy @MollyRingwald Uhuh. You know what they say about a man who is his own Lawyer right.  Also that does not mean that she is being coersed.   But having said that i will go back and watch the hearing.
@DrGreenThumb45 @MollyRingwald Thats your opinion my is still evolving.  Thank you for the info.  If theres more and your willing please send it.

@DrGreenThumb45 @bella_pmk @MollyRingwald Not really.  But am fishing for information.  Read my bio.
@DrGreenThumb45 @MollyRingwald Or to your experience.  Because i know so many more who see this and think a kindered spirit. This more your experience is not the final say in all things not even close.
@DrGreenThumb45 @MollyRingwald Cool thank you this a start
@bella_pmk @DrGreenThumb45 @MollyRingwald Not really just not stupid.  Or empty headed.  Good luck with your next troll attack.  No not really
@DrGreenThumb45 @bella_pmk @MollyRingwald Also show me those record or better yet tell how you got them or from were you got them.
@DrGreenThumb45 @bella_pmk @MollyRingwald Lol there it it is again that attempt shut me down by making it seem like im defective.  You can shove right back were you git it from.
@LindaWarriorGal @bella_pmk @DrGreenThumb45 @MollyRingwald Nah.  Not my style.  I already know what i think.  Plus there is one of me 4 or 5 of you attacking me now.  Im on the defensive.  Having said that im utterly open to what you bring me and will read and research it woth an open mind
@bella_pmk @DrGreenThumb45 @MollyRingwald Then backed it up.  Im willing to discuss anything you bring with actual proof.
@DrGreenThumb45 @bella_pmk @MollyRingwald Again i say you have backed up nothing.
@FrancesannMaga @DrGreenThumb45 @bella_pmk @MollyRingwald So do you all.  Lol jeez louis.  I have not seen one thing said here backed up by anyone.  Provide and you will be provided.  Simple
@DrGreenThumb45 @bella_pmk @MollyRingwald Based on what you found on the internet and what?... You armchair sleuth you!  Did you also interview the witnesses or Kavenaugh or Ford.  Did you know him then or at all.  Please!
@bella_pmk @DrGreenThumb45 @MollyRingwald Lol your has done the same.  Nor has a you figured that out yet.  My first question to hiim was did he find himself you was he fed this info
@DrGreenThumb45 @MollyRingwald And where is yours please you all talk.
@bella_pmk @DrGreenThumb45 @MollyRingwald Lol. Im not a show horse.  Pick a point and we can discuss.
@DrGreenThumb45 @bella_pmk @MollyRingwald And yet my reseaerch shows your wrong.  And you have not come up with the one actual possiblity.
@bella_pmk @DrGreenThumb45 @MollyRingwald And your prejudice.  You have formed an opinion based on an extremely small sampling.  I bet alot of bias as well
@DrGreenThumb45 @bella_pmk @MollyRingwald You did not ask me did you nor did answer my question
@DrGreenThumb45 @MollyRingwald And there it is.  Your telling that im less because i dont agree with you.  BS.  Your intimidation tatics dont work here.
@DrGreenThumb45 @MollyRingwald Because my resaech show that all that you just stated is false.  She may have perjured herself on one point do you k ow what it is
@DrGreenThumb45 @MollyRingwald And all of this you did yourself.  Its not from some guy on the internet.
@SBrannian @DineshDSouza Fine probe/investigation and there was no proof of wrong doing. This smells like a prelude to a dissmissal based your decided lost faith in the institutes of law that performed this duty.  Because you did not like its outcome
@mccrady_e @amJoy What are you tallking about?
@DineshDSouza And yet even after the courts find hillary clinton not guilty you stil say she is guilty.  So which is it mmm.  You have destroyed the notion of the party of law.
@DrGreenThumb45 @MollyRingwald Yeah thats twitter.  Not the court of law.  Public oppinion does not change the truth.  So lie to yourselfs if that is the only way to justify your mindset and actions.  But if you expect me to play along because it will upset you.  Just absolutly forget it.

@BushyRoyale @NickJFuentes I disagree.  I think you have that backwards.  Sex is wonderful.  Making violence seem cool and manly or womanly infiltrates and or desensitizes.  More and more people are solving there problems with shooting, knifing or beating someone.  Were as porn leads to sex.......

@BlackWidow1928 @realDonaldTrump Not missing and yes trump was wrongly acussed there.  They were hiding from ICE.  What trump is guilty of is seperating kid from parent and putting them in detention area.  Or concentration camps if you will.
@BlackWidow1928 @realDonaldTrump He created a safe house for children who were either seperated or came here alone.

@BlackWidow1928 @realDonaldTrump Yesh thats not proof they were torn apart or when they were taken.  Plus the law that states it

@BlackWidow1928 @realDonaldTrump So did i when i found out about. And i told what i found.  Yes the 1500 hundred was fasley blamed on trump.  Obama never took children away from there parents.  That is on trump.
