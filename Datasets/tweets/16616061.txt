A13: How well it works depends in part on the match between vax virus used in the vaccine &amp; the circulating viruses that season #ATLSciChat
A13: #Fluvax effectiveness can vary year-to-year among different age &amp; risk groups &amp; even by vaccine type. #ATLSciChat
A12: This estimate is among the overall population during seasons when most circulating flu viruses are like vaccine viruses #ATLSciChat
A12: While vaccine effectiveness can vary, recent studies show vaccine reduces the risk of #flu illness by ~50-60%. #ATLSciChat
A12: These estimates provide more info about how well this season‚Äôs vaccine is working. #ATLSciChat

A10: A wide range of complications can be caused by #flu, and anyone can get sick with flu and become severely ill. #ATLSciChat
A10: However, some ppl will develop complications as a result of the #flu. #ATLSciChat

A10: #Flu usually comes on suddenly, and the image below shows some of the symptoms that people who have flu often feel. #ATLSciChat https://t.co/eXPppgjUlw
A10: #Flu is different from a cold. It can cause mild to severe illness, and at times can even lead to death. #ATLSciChat
A9: The most common side effects from the #flu shot are soreness, redness, tenderness or swelling where the shot was given. #ATLSciChat
A9: OR with no flu vaccine viruses at all (which is the case for recombinant influenza vaccine). #ATLSciChat https://t.co/uPC0QmDpNs
A9: With flu vaccine viruses that have been inactivated &amp; are therefore not infectious. #ATLSciChat
A9: This isn‚Äôt possible because flu vaccines given w/ a needle are currently made in two ways. #ATLSciChat
A9: No. A #flu shot cannot cause flu illness. #ATLSciChat
A8: For the best protection, everyone 6 months and older should get a flu vaccine annually. #ATLSciChat
A8: 2. Because #flu viruses are always changing, the formulation of the #fluvax is reviewed each yr &amp; sometimes updated. #ATLSciChat
A8: 1. The body‚Äôs immune response from vaccination declines over time, so a yearly vax is needed for optimal protection. #ATLSciChat
A8: Yes! A #flu vaccine is needed every season for two important reasons. #ATLSciChat
A7: #NIVW occurs every December &amp; highlights the importance of continuing #flu vaccination through the holiday season &amp; beyond #ATLSciChat
A7:  In fact, next week (Dec 4-10) is National Influenza Vaccination Week (NIVW).  #ATLSciChat
A7: But getting vaccinated later is OK! Vaccination should continue throughout the flu season, even in January or later. #ATLSciChat
A7: CDC recommends everyone 6 months &amp; older get a flu vaccine every year by the end of October, if possible. #ATLSciChat
A6: A yearly #flu vaccine is important b/c it‚Äôs the best way to reduce the chances that you‚Äôll get flu &amp; spread it to others #ATLSciChat
A6: Finally, getting vaccinated yourself also protects ppl around you, including those more vulnerable to serious #flu illness. #ATLSciChat
A6: Flu vaccination also may make your illness milder if you do get sick with #flu. #ATLSciChat
A6: Vaccination helps protect women during &amp; after pregnancy. Getting vaccinated can also protect a baby from flu after birth. #ATLSciChat
A6: #Flu vaccination is an important preventive tool for ppl w/ chronic health conditions. #ATLSciChat
A6: It can reduce the risk of flu-associated hospitalization, including among children &amp; older adults! #ATLSciChat
A6: First, #flu vaccination can keep you from getting sick with flu. #ATLSciChat
A6: A yearly #flu vaccine is important for a number of different reasons. #ATLSciChat
A5: For more information on this process, visit: https://t.co/Idk09d5clA #ATLSciChat
A5: @US_FDA makes the final decision about vaccine viruses for #flu vaccines to be sold in the US. #ATLSciChat
A5: But each country makes their own decision about which viruses should be included in flu vaccines licensed in their country. #ATLSciChat
A5: @WHO recommends specific vax viruses for inclusion in #flu vaccines. #ATLSciChat
A5: Good vax virus: 1. could be used in vax production &amp; 2. would protect against viruses likely to circulate during next season #ATLSciChat
A5: Scientists also have to consider whether or not there‚Äôs a good vaccine virus available. #ATLSciChat
A5: #Fluvax viruses must be similar to influenza viruses predicted to circulate most commonly during the upcoming season.
A5: Also, the degree of similarity between available #fluvax viruses &amp; circulating flu viruses is important. #ATLSciChat
A5: An overview of influenza surveillance in the United States can be found here: https://t.co/TYZBTLHnUH #ATLSciChat
@DrBelkis The cell-culture based vaccine is called Flucelvax Quadrivalent.
A5: These data indicate which viruses are most likely to circulate &amp; cause illness the next season. #ATLSciChat
@DrBelkis Those with severe egg allergy should get vaccinated in a medical setting.
@DrBelkis No, those with severe egg allergy can get any vaccine that is otherwise appropriate for them.
A5: #Flu viruses in the seasonal #fluvax are selected each year based on surveillance data. #ATLSciChat
A4: To learn more about each of these 3 different technologies, visit: https://t.co/lGf7POJ8Zr #ATLSciChat
A4: Different manufacturers use different production technologies, but all #flu vaccines meet @US_FDA requirements. #ATLSciChat
A4: All commercially available #flu vaccines in the US are made by private sector manufacturers. #ATLSciChat
A4: There are 3 different flu vaccine technologies approved by the @US_FDA: Egg-based, cell-based, and recombinant flu vaccines. #ATLSciChat
A3: @US_FDA makes the final decision about vaccine viruses for flu vax to be sold in the U.S. #ATLSciChat
A3: Recommendations are also made according to which flu vax viruses are available for flu vax production. #ATLSciChat
A3: Recommendations are based on which flu viruses are likely to cause the most illness in the upcoming season. #ATLSciChat
A3:  WHO CCs &amp; NICs recommend flu vax viruses to be included in the annual Northern Hemis &amp; Southern Hemis #flu vaccines. #ATLSciChat
A3: CDC &amp; other WHO CCs &amp; flu labs use circulating flu viruses &amp; make flu vaccine viruses for possible vaccine production. #ATLSciChat
A3: As the United States NIC, CDC compiles &amp; analyzes #flu activity year-round in the U.S. #ATLSciChat
@cadenhart_71 Sometimes ppl get other symptoms like muscle aches, but these	are not the flu &amp; are much milder than actually getting the flu.
A3: CDC is also a National Influenza Center (NIC) for United States. #ATLSciChat
A3: CDC is one of 5 @WHO Collaborating Centers on Influenza (CCs) that tests #flu viruses from around the world. #ATLSciChat
.@cadenhart_71 Sometimes people have soreness at the spot where they were	vaccinated, but this is usually mild. #ATLSciChat
.@cadenhart_71 Flu vaccines either have killed viruses or no viruses at all so	they can't give you the flu. #ATLSciChat
A3: #Flu labs around the world collect &amp; test flu viruses &amp; track flu-related illness, hospitalization &amp; death. #ATLSciChat
This season ACIP, CDC &amp; AAP recommend against the use of nasal spray #fluvax because of concerns about its effectiveness. #ATLSciChat https://t.co/LORUxwHhpy
A2: These vaccines protect against the same viruses as the trivalent vaccine and an additional B virus. #ATLSciChat
A2: There are also flu vaccines made to protect against four flu viruses, called quadrivalent vaccines. #ATLSciChat
A2: Trivalent vaccines are made to protect against 3 flu viruses: an A (H1N1) virus, an A (H3N2) virus, and a B virus. #ATLSciChat
A2: Seasonal #fluvax protects against #flu viruses that research indicates will be most common during the upcoming season. #ATLSciChat
A2: These antibodies provide protection against infection w/ the viruses that are in the vaccine. #ATLSciChat
A2: #Flu vaccines cause antibodies to develop in the body about two weeks after vaccination. #ATLSciChat
.@cadenhart_71 Flu vaccine is recommended for everyone 6 months of age and older	to help prevent illness from flu. #ATLSciChat
A1: Once in the air, these droplets can land in mouths/noses of ppl nearby. #ATLSciChat https://t.co/MEiSZgD5mJ
A1: Droplets are expelled into the air when people infected with the flu cough, sneeze or talk. #ATLSciChat
A1: Most experts believe #flu viruses spread mainly through coughs &amp; sneezes of infected ppl. #ATLSciChat
A1: Over the course of a flu season, different types (A &amp; B) &amp; subtypes (influenza A) of influenza circulate &amp; cause illness. #ATLSciChat
A1: Influenza C infections are not thought to cause epidemics &amp; D viruses are not known to infect or cause illness in ppl. #ATLSciChat
@30ABeachBum Generally it takes about two weeks to develop antibodies after	vaccination. #ATLSciChat
A1: Influenza A and B viruses that routinely spread in ppl are responsible for seasonal #flu epidemics each year (flu season). #ATLSciChat
A1: There are 4 types of influenza viruses: A, B, C, and D. But the two main types are A and B viruses. #ATLSciChat
