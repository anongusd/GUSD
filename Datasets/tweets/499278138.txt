@Eugene_Scott I have said in the past that I‚Äôm color blind, thinking I was showing that I know you are an equal. I did not realize when I said this I was erasing the true essence of you. I apologize. I see you now in all your amazing hues.
@OhMyItsAlly @cmclymer Absolutely!  You go, girl. I‚Äôll keep you in my heart and send lots of positive get better vibes your way.  You got this, friend. If you ever need an ear or a shoulder, my dm‚Äôs are open.
@OhMyItsAlly @cmclymer It was hell. She was paralyzed from the hips down, as well as her tongue and esophagus.  Still suffers from weakness in her right leg. And has to eat very spicy, sour, sweet, foods in order to taste them.  I hope you are well now and don‚Äôt suffer from too many side effects. ‚ù§Ô∏è
@OhMyItsAlly @cmclymer My daughter was diagnosed w/GBS just before her 2nd birthday.  The agony she went thru as her nerve endings came back online is something she still remembers at 20 years old.  I couldn't touch her w/o causing more pain and she couldn't understand why I couldn't make it better.
