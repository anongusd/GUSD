More on this point: https://t.co/gKDjSHhIKB https://t.co/ENUExLVieE
Also have to routinely note that communitarian sprit, social welfare programs, environmental remediation, and reparative racial justice are confused with socialism not by its opponents but its advocates.

Fin. Apologies for the twitter thread, most of which are worthless exercises.
Anyway, point is Romney wasn't exactly an oracle. Russian grand strategy was obvious to all non-blinkered observers as early as 2007, following the cyber attacks on Estonia. Those who were in thrall to their own ideological preconceptions projected intransigence on Russia hawks.
It's no surprise that this was the honestly-held view inside the Obama White House even until Russian paratroopers seized the airport in Simferopol. That's no excuse, but it's an acknowledgement of the Obama admin's excessively ideological approach to foreign policy.
Some of my professors genuinely believed that Russian provocations and expansionism was the product of a response to George W. Bush's unilateralism, not Moscow's grand strategic efforts to overturn the post-War consensus in Europe.
I did my grad work on the need to contain an revanchist Russia through aggressive diplomacy and the ABM deployments to allies in Europe and NE Asia. Many of my professors looked at me like I had three heads. And this was just months after the invasion of Georgia.

@ishaantharoor Not sure how to respond to that. There’s a book on the subject if you change your mind on arguing from that position.
@ishaantharoor Is that retributive? Does it seek to create institutions dedicated to downward social leveling?
@ishaantharoor “All identity politics should be avoided” is arguing against human nature. Explained this in book and subsequent interviews. As it manifests in the form practiced by right/left retributive social justice advocates, however, it has few redeeming traits.

Shouldn't someone have produced the *real* FAQ by now?
This is a response to a tweet in which I admonish people who feel obliged to take the GND seriously. Couldn't have made my point better. https://t.co/t8QtRggDLK
That was my favorite line in the whole thing. https://t.co/lzWjRjcRWB
Job training and education for the millions displaced but the decimation of the productive economy? Who knows? Eleventy trillion? The numbers don't matter, because you can just print money! This isn't a serious proposal, and you shouldn't treat it seriously.
This stuff isn't new. It's progressive wish list stuff, and independent scoring has found it's pretty expensive (over 10 years). 	Job guarantee: up to $5 trillion.	Universal health care: $32 trillion.	"Economic security" or a universal min wage: $38 trillion
The evolving rationale insists that it was "leaked" "doctored" and was an "early draft," somehow hosted on AOC's website and authored by her team. Fine. But the "unwilling to work" bit is a strange hill to die on considering what's in the text is by no means mitigating.
The gaslighting of those who read the GND FAQ concludes with a demand that we read the resolution. If you do, you learn it commits to "guaranteeing a job" to "all the people of the United States" as well  as "high-quality health care" "affordable housing" and "economic security."

@nickconfessore I don’t doubt it. But that feeling, deeply and sincerely held, doesn’t mean we should suspend critical thinking. Even if that doesn’t spare those feelings.
@williamjordann @nickconfessore Both and neither as stated. More in the middle. I don’t see this crisis as existential, but as a crisis. And I think those who advocate dramatic reduction in lifestyles are engaged in the pursuit of penance, not an effective or realizable policy proposal
@nickconfessore But if it's literally accurate, the objection is, again, to a preferred framing because it detracts from the moral urgency its advocates hope to borrow from the existential threats faced down by the Greatest Generation.
MEOW is a tactic designed to terminate debate and stigmatize opposition to a set of domestic policy preferences. https://t.co/ibtJxDg7mz
@nickconfessore Some might say that borrowing the unambiguous moral urgency of an immediate and exigent global financial meltdown or a genocidal fascist menace to advance a preferred domestic political program is, indeed, unreasonable, and that argument doesn't deserved to be dismissed outright.

(Democrats don't actually favor all that stuff. They just said they did because hardened border security is popular with the public, and they needed to look reasonable while standing athwart a few miles of steel slots).
If Trump were to demand that Democrats pass all that border security stuff they said they favor--access roads, personnel at ports, visa tracking, etc and no wall--he'd split the Democratic Party and probably have the upper hand on border security.

@JerylBier "There is no military solution to" I guess, but that usually is reserved for conflicts in which we have almost no stake in the outcome.
As right-leaning commentators go, I'm among this administration's more vocal critics. But you should be intellectually honest enough to give credit where it's due. The Trump admin has handled the opportunity to rid the world of a bloody, oppressive socialist despot is laudable.
There's a strain of commentary that hears names associated with the neoconservative movement and assumes as debacle is imminent, but they have to ignore what's right in front of their eyes to render that verdict. I know what I'd call that.
The competence with which State coordinated the Western Hemisphere's recognition of guaido was a marvel. Spain is following. Military leaders are defecting. The Maduro regime is on the back foot and the army has not massacred as it did in 2014, 16, and 17.
No one wants deployments in Venezuela. Believe me, it wouldn't be pretty. But, yes, you have to be prepared to contain a crisis. That's responsible statecraft any admin would pursue. And everything this admin has done re: Venezuela makes that *less* likely.
Hate to tell you, folks, but an admin that says "there's no military option in Venezuela" could be forced to reverse itself if there is an implosion of a state rich with oil, weapons, and drugs that becomes a haven for terrorist networks and incubates a refugee crisis.
The performative garment-rending over "All options are on the table" re: Venezuela is too much to bear. They all say that, as they should, even when it's a bluff. Obama admin repeatedly used the phrase re: Iran, when you know that all options most certainly weren't on the table.

No, what's happening in Venezuela isn't illegal or illegitimate. No, Western sanctions on regime officials aren't responsible for poverty, starvation and violence. And, no, Trump isn't the one siding with Russia here. The Democratic Socialists are. https://t.co/yINMxhCaK8
We are often told Democratic Socialists are more democratic than socialist, but the distinction is obvious only in rhetoric. When forced to chose, between the two, the Democratic Socialists go with the latter. https://t.co/yINMxhCaK8

Almost no one in the West has living memory of what it looks like when a gov't inflates its currency into oblivion to pay down debt, for example. That's because the reviled experts learned their lessons from those debacles. Cumulative experience and institutional memory are real.

@kombiz 1) you describe a response to exogenous factors, not blackmail, which is what is alleged. 	2) acknowledge that words are being put into her mouth by Tom here, though it is a contextual inference that's not unreasonable given how many have made that explicit claim this week.
@AdamSerwer @nickconfessore That's fine. I agree with that. Irresponsible enough to be alleging what she's alleging, though she's hardly alone this week in making that claim.
@kombiz She is saying he's acting in bad faith under duress without evidence. That's many things, but it isn't remotely responsible.
@AdamSerwer @nickconfessore I think that's a reasonable interpretation of the context, given the last 72 hours of commentary that has been explicit, but words are being put in her mouth here in Tom's tweet. It's enough that she's alleging Graham is acting in bad faith under duress without evidence.

@cjane87 Not being on Twitter seems to mean getting a ton of work done.
@cjane87 This one, which is like 13 posts back now https://t.co/laC8vED0wD
@cjane87 Williamson's latest on ideology as status applies. When/if the left comes around eventually to the notion that BDS isn't just about anti-Zionism, the right who responds by saying "well, your prior support is an indelible moral failure" will be seeking to preserve a status.
@cjane87 Well, I didn't say "the right in IA04"
@cjane87 many on the right broke with him a long time ago. Does them short shrift not to make note of that.
@cjane87 Some did, some didn't. But those who did rested their case on the ambiguity of King's racial views. His latest comments contain no ambiguity, which confirms that outright and overt (vs. coded) support for "white supremacy" is anathema to mainstream political movements.
@cjane87 I think that is the question for a handful of honest observers, but I really don't think the majority are genuinely interested in a dispassionate analysis of this moment. I think they want to score political points, and the GOP softening on King doesn't advance their position.
You hear this often, but it is truly perverse. Here's the right coming around to what you ostensibly say is your long-held position, and your reaction is to criticize them, insisting that, in effect, it will never be enough to satisfy you.
