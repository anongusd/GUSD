@Michael21662759 @XanaduMusings @Thomas1774Paine Have you checked the national debt under Trump???	It went up!	Partially because of his permanent tax cuts for the wealthy. 	And he's supposed to care about working people?	And the the treasonous remarks about Russia? 	 Really?

@JayneQPatriot @wisconsinGodsPl My personal  experience with conspiracy theorists is this:	I have a friend/family member that is prone to believe in these theories. 	My take is that they lack something in their lives. They haven't religious faith or enough meaning so they find it in these non-provible stories.
@JayneQPatriot @wisconsinGodsPl I am an open-minded person.	I also have a healthy scepticism of supposed facts given in a hyperbolic speech from the potus. 	Trumps "facts" are only repeated by known conspiracy theory websites and know propaganda outlets. 	Real journalism exists outside these realms.
@JayneQPatriot @wisconsinGodsPl You are the author of this meme?	Where are your sources? 	Footnotes for the facts??	On the ground witnesses?	You can't expect me to just believe a YouTube video of Trump propaganda and a meme?!??!	Do you really think people are that gullible?
@JayneQPatriot @wisconsinGodsPl You expect me to trust anything Trump says in your YouTube video?	 I watched part of it but it's just the same lies that come out of his mouth.	 He's a nationalist, isolationist, populist conman.	 	He is morally corrupt. How can you trust anything he says?

@MomIncorrect @sentient72 @RealJack Yeah, 	 I'm going to need your source on that one.
@MomIncorrect @sentient72 @RealJack Oops, moot
@MomIncorrect @sentient72 @RealJack Yeah, but the far right keep on bringing it up like it matters. Otherwise we wouldn't be talking about it, right? 	 I just have a real problem w/ conspiracy theorists. They are all over Twitter.
@MomIncorrect @sentient72 @RealJack I listen to both sides. 	Obama didn't make racially insensitive remarks on purpose. 	He did have a different opinion on certain issues but never had the intent to divide.
@MomIncorrect @sentient72 @RealJack I don't think he was the best. 	 He had his pros and cons.
@sentient72 @MomIncorrect @RealJack You really need to stay away from the conspiracy websites.	 	Barack Hussein Obama the second is his birth name.	 You can view his long form birth certificate online but make sure to use a legit website.
@MomIncorrect @sentient72 @RealJack I miss the good old days with somewhat boring presidents. 	Instead we have a frickin circus.
@MomIncorrect @sentient72 @RealJack I don't think people have any evidence so it's a mute point.
@MomIncorrect @sentient72 @RealJack There is no indication that he lied. 	He went to a Christian church for years!	 This all stems from people trying to create an "otherness" to Obama. Whether it's his unfamiliar name or where he grew up. 	Trump was the first birther to go mainstream.
@sentient72 @MomIncorrect @RealJack What? 	 What are you talking about? 	 Even if his father was Muslim, so what?, doesn't make him one. 	Are you religious?
@MomIncorrect @sentient72 @RealJack I don't get that. 	 Trump has made more racially insensitive remarks then any president I've encountered.	 We are far more divided as a country over the last 2 years then the last 10.
@sentient72 @MomIncorrect @RealJack If you grew up in a place that was majority Muslim you might have the same opinion as Obama. 	But I guess for you  that would require actual open mindedness and an imagination.
@sentient72 @MomIncorrect @RealJack Again. Grew up in Indonesia. 	 Again. Video was edited. 	Also. Birthers are a bunch of conspiracy theorists.
@sentient72 @MomIncorrect @RealJack Obama grew up in Indonesia from 1971 to 1979. 	 Indonesia is a Muslim majority country. OBVIOUSLY, he would be exposed to the prayers growing up!	I don't question yours or anyone else's religious claims. Why would you insult Obama by doing so?
@sentient72 @MomIncorrect @RealJack This is called dishonest editing. 	In the original interview he says he's a Christian and refers to his Christian faith. 	It's  insulting to suggest otherwise.
@1NorCalGal @DjLots3 Yes! Listen to brain-dead garbage like Infowars and https://t.co/PjEyMkTVcl.	 Where nothing is verified!	And they tell you what you want to hear!	 And you don't have to think for yourself!

@MomIncorrect @sentient72 @RealJack McCain was always above reproach. 	 After Trump said he wasn't a war hero, McCain (like an actual adult), responded by saying he had important work to do and didn't have time to respond to that. 	He was a TRUE statesman. 	Unlike our current imposter.

@Thirty0n3 Got to get back to work.	 Good talking with you.
@Thirty0n3 I'm all for absence of violence, 	Obviously. I guess I'm wondering what your real world solutions would be then? 	 I'm all for making things better.
@Thirty0n3 Historically speaking yes I'm sure this has happened.	 But in recent times??
@Thirty0n3 Do you believe that hierarchy has value? 	 I understand your premise, but don't see how it can work in the real world.
@Thirty0n3 Ok. What is an example of this then? Legal right to violently steal?
@Thirty0n3 The problem is that you just want me to equate myself and the people that work for the government as having the exact same role. 	If we are taking just about my neighbor across the street then that's different. They would have no claim on body or property.
@Thirty0n3 Body, nothing. 	Property- I wouldn't say they have a higher claim. It's more like a agreement. Partnership if you will. 	 They provide the infrastructure for the city that services the house I own. 	I can always go live in Slab City if I didn't want any rules. :)
@Thirty0n3 We all except the "necessity" of government for infrastructure, military defense, post office, etc.  These won't work with the private sector. A majority of taxes we pay are necessary. Some of it is questionable.
@Thirty0n3 I'm self-employed so I pay taxes once during the year and yes it's high. I would agree with you to a certain point on the tax front. Yes, these are problems. Even with our high taxes we still have one of the highest standards of living in the world. There is no perfect system.
@Thirty0n3 Yes.
@Thirty0n3 I don't ever feel like I'm being restricted by either the government or other institutions on a regular basis. 	 There are some laws / regulations that on occasion go too far.
@Thirty0n3 I would like to think so. 	 I think one of the greatest things this country has to offer is freedom of speech which I exercise. 	I know that government rules and regulations abound and we as citizens grow up in a nation with this being normalized.
@Thirty0n3 Makes sense.
@Thirty0n3 I haven't read anything of his, I just know he's a major proponent of anarchism. 	I'm not well versed in the Philosophy department. 	I've always been more interested in politics and culture.
@Thirty0n3 Agree with his ideals then.
@Thirty0n3 Are you a fan of Noam Chomsky?
@Thirty0n3 All of this is very interesting.	 I do however wonder how you would apply this to our relationship to government.	 Are you for Anarchism? 	And I do there is a difference between anarchy and anarchism.

@Thirty0n3 How do you get universalization of moral philosophy? 	 If I remember correctly, i don't think you're a fan of religion.	 I might be thinking of someone else though.
@RealJamesWoods @KLSouth You're sounding more and more like a pawn James.
@Thirty0n3 Question, 	 You are a libertarian I believe, right? 	 So you're okay with more state government, less federal?	Or What? More local?
@Thirty0n3 No. 	 When our system of government works like it should it's a good thing. 	Yes, our system of government has it's problems but compared to most other countries, believe it or not, we are far less corrupt.

@JillDoby @RealAlexJones Pizzagate- a guy showed up with a gun and could have shot someone.
@JillDoby @RealAlexJones Your right, I don't have proof that Putin has something on him. 	 I do have proof that Trump totally screwed up by saying there was no meddling. 	 That's extremely incompetent especially for someone that has a position of power with no match.
@JillDoby @RealAlexJones If roles were reversed- if you had a conservatively-run Twitter and Antifa was all over it spreading lies and conspiracy theories that resulted in some violence, would you hold up the same standard?
@JillDoby @RealAlexJones I don't watch CNN. 	 Trump was either completely incompetent with his comments or he's playing soft ball with Putin because he has something on him.
@JillDoby @RealAlexJones So you are  for the government getting involved in forcing a private company to be completely uncensored? 	Sounds like a lot of government interference in a private market. 	 Not very Republican.
@JillDoby @RealAlexJones At that time Russians were not trying to influence our elections, they weren't trying to expand their territories and didn't fight a proxy war with us. 	 Almost all Republicans in Congress are flabbergasted at Trumps stance on Russia as am I.
@JillDoby @RealAlexJones Not true. They are not a public space. You have to be consistent. You would not tell a religious or youth based website that they can't have restrictions on comments and/or speech? 	Every private company on the internet has the right to have restrictions, rules.
@JillDoby @RealAlexJones Even if you don't believe it could influence, we cannot have a foreign entity of any sort, especially Russia, trying to meddle in our elections. 	I can't believe that Republicans have gotten so Russian friendly in the last 2 years. It's a complete 180 from past Rep. Stands.

@JillDoby @RealAlexJones You also have to keep in mind that this is a private company. 		 They aren't controlled like a public space where you can pretty much say what you want with a couple of exceptions.
@JillDoby @RealAlexJones I think they are trying to get the Russian interference under control. 	There unfortunately will be unintended  consequences.

@My2CentsStormXO Wow. What a total biased report.
@truthse40423814 @Education4Libs Well, it's like a liberal watching Fox News. It's the flip side. I don't watch Fox or CNN because they both are so biased to opposing sides. It's getting harder to find centrist news these days.
@cphorses_mary Are you aware that Trump had known racist Ted Nugent to the WH last year for lunch?	I'm not saying Trumps a racist but he says things that could be construed as such, just as Jeong's statements were completely wrong and should be condemned as should Trumps statements and friends
@Paul_TXUS @PatriotJenn @elguapo64 According to what I have heard locally, Patriot Prayer has started some of the violence.
@DLHay @PatriotJenn @elguapo64 Patriot Prayer has also had racists show up and protest with them. 	"Jeremy J. Christian, who was later arrested for the fatal stabbing of two men in an apparently racially-motivated attack, was seen at the march yelling racial slurs."	This hppnd on our Max line and 2 ppl died.
@DLHay @PatriotJenn @elguapo64 Last time they wanted to protest they decided to do it in Vancouver a suburb of Portland. That went well. The problem is that Patriot Prayer is actually not wanting a peaceful protest. 	It's not their m.o. 	If they wanted to protest peacefully, I would be all for it.
@truthse40423814 @Education4Libs So one or more  conservative on the show, I would agree. 	I just don't understand the over the top outrage like it's the end of the world with this show. If people don't like it, don't watch.	The outrage is actually probably helping ratings. I agree Whoopi went too far.
@marklutchman Let's be very fair about this. 		If she is a racist then Donald Trump is also.
@truthse40423814 @Education4Libs So what is wrong with having both viewpoints debating on the show. Why are you so opposed to dialogue and debate?
@truthse40423814 @Education4Libs Meghan McCain is Republican and conservative.
@PatriotJenn @elguapo64 I'm from PDX.  The problem here is that Patriot Prayer knows that Antifa is going to show up if they protest in Portland. They know there is going to be violence and they want it. Both Antifa and Patriot Prayer are a bunch of losers looking for aggression. Period.
@truthse40423814 @Education4Libs So you judge a book by its cover?	Don't they have a conservative on the show? 	I don't like the show myself but I am open to hearing different points of view.

@rescuehoney @RubinReport Trump has complemented Putin by calling him a competitor, a strong leader, said Putin was nice, that they are outsmarting us and that maybe they will be friends.!!! 	Bush, Clinton, Reagan, Obama never said things like this to Gaddifi, etc,

@rescuehoney @RubinReport I'm sorry, what does that have to do with anything? I'm not a Hillary supporter.

@rescuehoney @RubinReport Why would these people lie? It's at the point where there are so many people that have evidence of Russian hacking. To believe Trump it's like creating a conspiracy theory. One of Putin's minions actually said that if Hillary was elected that there would be war!
@rescuehoney @RubinReport ???? Flexibility for what?
@rescuehoney @RubinReport Trump feels invincible and nothing can touch him, either that or he's not so bright. If you lie as much as Trump at some point you start to believe your own lies as truth. It's a show. As long as Trump keeps on pushing for better treatment of Russia he keeps quiet. It's simple.
@marklutchman He chose to believe Putin over his own countries intelligence agencies. There's something really wrong with that!
@rescuehoney @RubinReport So you disagree with Trump on Russian meddling? 	 That's a start.
@rescuehoney @RubinReport I think Putin has dirt on Trump. It would have been very easy to get with the constant trips to Russia Trump used to take. He was known as a "player" and cheated on his wives. If Obama would have of said these things he would have been crucified already.
@rescuehoney @RubinReport So our entire intelligence agencys, most republicans in Congress, Senate intelligence committee and experts on foreign affairs are ALL wrong but somehow Trump is right? 	Wow.
@rescuehoney @RubinReport He was totally played by Kim Jong Un. We have been here before. They have  made these promises before! And of course these lives matter. He's LUCKY that Kim Jong Un is not crazy enough to attack us. Totally irresponsible and hypocritical.
@rescuehoney @RubinReport I wasn't sure until today that Trump had ties/controlled by Russia. Now i have no doubt.  Every single former cia agent they have interviewed has said that today was a huge mistake by potus and they all are shocked by what he said.
@rescuehoney @RubinReport Lol. No. Absolutely not. What Trump is saying in public effects our relations with that country. If anything it confuses and undermines  our experienced diplomats that are trying to negotiate with Russia. It's like the ridiculous, childish insults from Trump to Kim Jong Un!
@rsrusso17 @RubinReport He is trying to push Congress through his words to loosen pressure on Russia. Objectively looked at this is cause for great concern.
@rescuehoney @RubinReport I've been a contractor for 20+ years, so yes. 	What trump has done that no other president has done is that he has actually praised our enemys. Even the Republicans in Congress are astounded. The potus should never praise people like Putin, Kim Jong Un, etc. 	Never

@RubinReport Just wondering,  Dave, your thoughts on Trumps comments today regarding believing Putin over his own government agencies? 	I'm not a conspiracy theorist but I would put money on the idea that Putin has dirt on Trump and has control over him

@Thirty0n3 A lot of poor people pay little or no tax.  How are they going to afford paying for grade, high school. 	There is a reason why a lot of lower income people don't go to college. 	And not everyone can get a scholarship.
@Thirty0n3 Unfortunately, I think poor people would get the shaft in a system like that. Middle and upper income people could take the unpaid taxes to pay for school but poor people wouldn't be able to afford.

@Thirty0n3 You mean like a voucher system where all schools are private but taxes pay for the voucher?	I still think public schools have a place. I went to 3 different private schools and 2 different public schools. Private schools are not always better. Believe me
@tsengputterman @NotreesNoneEver Radicals never make lasting change. It always ends horribly. 	The moderates are always the ones really keeping things together.
@marklutchman But it's ok for you to have a platform here on Twitter  but not them? What if they are espousing views similar to Yours? Does that change your viewpoint?
@Thirty0n3 I would tend to agree with him on this. My point is that he wouldn't necessarily use religion as a reason not to talk about these in school. Non-religious people have vast moral differences from each other.
@Thirty0n3 Not conservative views either. Ben Shapiro actually believes that high schools, etc. shouldn't even talk about things like gay marriage, birth control, non-binary, trans. issues, etc. He believes that the parents should be ones talking to their own children about such topics.
@Thirty0n3 I'm speaking more in terms of his arguments against, for example,  gay marriage and how he will use non-religious standards to, for example, explain why schools shouldn't force progressive ideas on our children.
@Thirty0n3 Oh, 	 Yeah, I wouldn't fault him for that. "To each his own". 	He actually doesn't use religious texts to defend his positions. He comes at it from a more rational viewpoint.

@Thirty0n3 @funlibertarian2 Wow. I had no idea that I'm supposed to have all of these problems and symptoms. I should call my siblings and talk with my parents and let them know that we are officially victims and need to act as such.

@CSmithengton @RealMAGASteve @LadyThriller69 Oh, yeah, you have changed my mind with your all caps response.
@bruur1 @DineshDSouza @doanfilm @DNC So let's get this straight. You think that the deregulation that led to the crash should be held up afterwards so that it can happen again? Huh? Human nature will cause this if not regulated.
@bruur1 @DineshDSouza @doanfilm I call bullshit. All you have to do is look at ww1 and ww2 and you have your answer.
@bruur1 @DineshDSouza @doanfilm @DNC NAME the legislation that the DNC proposed or passed to make it so that anyone can buy a home!
@bruur1 @DineshDSouza @doanfilm @DNC You do realize that potus would be in favor of the continuing deregulation of  4 out of 5 of these, Right? So In other words with his deregulation platform he would have made things much worse then what we had.
@bruur1 @DineshDSouza @doanfilm @DNC Please explain to me in detail how the DNC "Fucked" the American people in 08? I have already presented statistics that prove otherwise so I'm curious. By the way, you will never win an argument by name calling.
@Neverwatchnflag @Tgpalmer64 Which brings us back to my original question: How do you get people that do not want to work in agriculture to do so? Mexicans want these jobs. Americans for the most part don't. Solution?
@Tgpalmer64 @Neverwatchnflag They are getting a much higher wage then they would In Mexico. I'm a contractor and work with Mexican immigrants daily. Some legal, some not, I never ask. They are all here to work because they make so much more here
@Tgpalmer64 I personally think it's absurd to expect people that don't want to work the fields to work the fields  especially if they have an alternative to work a job elsewhere.
@Tgpalmer64 How, exactly, is paying someone minimum wage slavery?
@bruur1 @DineshDSouza @doanfilm I Never said this was Bush's fault. I agree that it was deregulation's fault(Republicans love deregulation!). My point is that Bush/Obama stimulus and regulation  brought us back to normal. Credit where credit is due.
@bruur1 @DineshDSouza @doanfilm @DNC Interesting, you have not cited ONE statistic, ONE source, and use only talking points. The minute I presented factual statistics to you, you reverted to name-calling. As immature as potus
@Tgpalmer64 @Neverwatchnflag So how do you convince a homeless person that probably has either a drug or alcohol or mental health issue to go and work in the fields? Sounds like a pipe dream.
@Tgpalmer64 @Neverwatchnflag We must pay everyone minimum wage. Always
@Neverwatchnflag @Tgpalmer64 The high  cost of housing in California is mainly in the cities , not in the rural agricultural areas where these jobs are.
@Tgpalmer64 Farms in Border states are already hurting for labor. Look it up, don't take my word for it!	Also, you must be fine with paying a lot more cash for your food.
@Tgpalmer64 Fact: most Americans are too entitled to do this work. 	Fact: in U.S.  history we have never gotten to 0% unemployment because you will always have people that are unwilling to work. 	Fact: we need immigrants that are willing to do the work that our lazy asses won't
@bruur1 @DineshDSouza @doanfilm @DNC Reality check: Under the end of Bush 2 and early Obama we had the worst recession since the great depression! Due to Bush 2 and Obama administration actions our great country was saved from another depression.
@bruur1 @DineshDSouza @doanfilm I work too. Again, using talking points and garbage talk. Where are your sources????

@shiy70 @John_KissMyBot @ErikaMcdougall I agree that govt. prgms. have gone too far. The farther left you go the more you think minoritys can't do it on their own.

@DisavowTrump20 @MamaRose2017 She went too far with the mob comment though.

@RealCandaceO If the unemployment rate goes up then just reverse it and allow less legal immigration. Really simple
@RealCandaceO We need to tie the number of immigrants we give work visas to and accept into this country to the unemployment rate. It's historically low so we should loosen up on legal immigration because businesses are now hurting for workers.
@bruur1 @DineshDSouza @doanfilm I see your reference to Ayn Rand.
@bruur1 @DineshDSouza @doanfilm I agree most people can get out of poverty, but it's harder for some then others. ie; single mothers with children, people with mental disorders, etc.  I live in a city that's extremely expensive with rent. Actually the highest in comp. to the wages here
@bruur1 @DineshDSouza @doanfilm The pay rate growth for April is 4.56% 	The highest is has gotten in 10 years was back in late 2012 and  early 2013 at close to 8 %
@bruur1 @DineshDSouza @doanfilm I agree with this article but what does this have to do with the Welfare program?	Ooow, you really like calling me dummy. So harsh
@bruur1 @DineshDSouza @doanfilm U.S. job growth by year:	2011- 2.09 million	2012- 2.14 million	2013- 2.30 million	2014- 2.99 million	2015- 2.71 million	2016 - 2.24 million	2017 - 2.18 million	Wow. So much better
@bruur1 @DineshDSouza @doanfilm Sign of the times. When times are hard you have to help people more. When things get better you give out less help. The same thing happened during the great depression. They had government programs to help people that went away after things got better.

@bruur1 @DineshDSouza @doanfilm Interesting. I think you need to go back and compare the unemployment numbers from 2008 to 2016. And then look at the rise in the stock market from 2008 to 2016. And then look at the GDP from 2008 to 2016. Which was highest in 2015 under Obama. Trump still hasn't gotten there.
@SJSkald @MiracoloDiGigi @fox_of_floof @princess_stef69 @Camomochan Intersex is a deformity just like being born with organs outside your body, or with extra fingers, etc. That's why they always remove sexual organs of one sex after birth.
@MiracoloDiGigi @SJSkald @fox_of_floof @princess_stef69 @Camomochan Again, that's no really the point. Do you agree that there are some practices in other cultures past or present that you consider wrong?
@SJSkald @MiracoloDiGigi @fox_of_floof @princess_stef69 @Camomochan By the way, we are not talking about intersex, we are talking about nonbinary
@MiracoloDiGigi @SJSkald @fox_of_floof @princess_stef69 @Camomochan I gave you several other examples. I was very clear.
@bruur1 @DineshDSouza @doanfilm So, Just to be clear, your ok with the wealthy getting permanent tax cuts and the middle class getting the shaft in 7 years?
@SJSkald @MiracoloDiGigi @fox_of_floof @princess_stef69 @Camomochan Ah, one thing we can agree upon
@SJSkald @MiracoloDiGigi @fox_of_floof @princess_stef69 @Camomochan Of course it's a "thing". So what? "School Shootings" are a thing, "oppressive cults" are a thing, men having 3 wives is a "thing". Your point?
@SJSkald @MiracoloDiGigi @fox_of_floof @princess_stef69 @Camomochan Dont get it do You? 1 out of about every 8 to 10 tribes had a 3rd gender but it was more based on what duties you did. It was more about roles played.  Still a minority and still doesn't make it right. They also had canabalism. Is that right?
@bruur1 @DineshDSouza @doanfilm As the Official Spokesperson for "TrumpTard Nation" how do you feel about the redistribution of wealth from the middle class to the wealthy after the temporary tax cuts for the middle class end and the wealthy continue?

@MiracoloDiGigi @SJSkald @fox_of_floof @princess_stef69 @Camomochan I never said they didn't exist. My point, Again, is that just because you can point out a minority culture with a specific practice Does NOT make it right. That's all I'm saying. If you don't agree with that, I'm done
@BoomBlahBlah @DineshDSouza @doanfilm If that's the case they need to have Trump fix this. Because he can fix everything because he's like a superhero!!!!!!!

@MiracoloDiGigi @SJSkald @fox_of_floof @princess_stef69 @Camomochan You miss the point. Tired of trying to explain......must go back to work......please use logic
@bruur1 @DineshDSouza @doanfilm Went to private
@bruur1 @DineshDSouza @doanfilm It's "Mr. Dummy" to you. So, how exactly has he done this?
@BoomBlahBlah @DineshDSouza @doanfilm People that make minimum wage are slaves? Wow. Quite a statement
@MiracoloDiGigi @SJSkald @fox_of_floof @princess_stef69 @Camomochan Illegal means ONLY that an entire culture has agreed on the rules.
@MiracoloDiGigi @SJSkald @fox_of_floof @princess_stef69 @Camomochan Ok. Say I want 4 wives and all my friends do too. Same exact argument. It's been done in the past over many cultures. Marrying someone underage, arranged marriages, these all existed, yet I would imagine that you would have a problem with these.
@MiracoloDiGigi @SJSkald @fox_of_floof @princess_stef69 @Camomochan You live in a bubble. Do you really think these views would be tolerated or excepted in Russia, China, Africa or South America? Most people in the world don't even know the terminology yet. You would have to brainwash them
@MiracoloDiGigi @SJSkald @fox_of_floof @princess_stef69 @Camomochan Ok. Since you're really slow. I am a canabal (Just for this demonstration) and my friends are too. My justification for doing this is the FACT that canabalism has existed in cultures forever. Does that make it right? NO
@MiracoloDiGigi @SJSkald @fox_of_floof @princess_stef69 @Camomochan So their 3rd gender was somehow okay, but the canabalism was Not? Nice how you can pick or choose your modern, western self-righteous selective criticisms that only benefit you.
@MiracoloDiGigi @SJSkald @fox_of_floof @princess_stef69 @Camomochan Do i need to explain this to you again? Let me put it this way, as a micro-minority viewpoint, you need to convince the 99.99 + percent of people on the planet that what you have invented is legit. The onus is on you and there is no proof
@MiracoloDiGigi @SJSkald @fox_of_floof @princess_stef69 @Camomochan You have made my point exactly. You think canabalism, slavery is wrong but there are people and have been cultures that have not thought it wrong. 	It matters. Definitions matter.	 If you want to change everything as a minority YOU have to prove that it's legit. Not me
@MiracoloDiGigi @SJSkald @fox_of_floof @princess_stef69 @Camomochan Just because you can find a small minority culture that created this doesn't make it legit. You could use the same argument to validate  cannibalism, slavery, etc. 	Invalid point.
@BoomBlahBlah @DineshDSouza @doanfilm How are illegals slavery?
@JustJoTG What? Anecdotal evidence based on how people feel they are? Absurd
@callmegplease @fox_of_floof @princess_stef69 @Camomochan You exist, your definition doesn't
@princess_stef69 No
@SJSkald @fox_of_floof @princess_stef69 @Camomochan Seriously? Our entire planet is based on 2 sexes and 2 genders.  Born yesterday? 	The idea of non binary in western culture wasn't invented until 1948
@Truthbknown1111 @DineshDSouza @doanfilm I guess hiring 187 lobbyists is considered "draining the swamp"?
@Truthbknown1111 @DineshDSouza @doanfilm Well in that case, my "gut" tells me that Trump is horrible for this country. 	Better?	Since I guess logic and common sense doesn't matter anymore

@fox_of_floof @princess_stef69 @Camomochan The onus is on you, my friend
@fox_of_floof @princess_stef69 @Camomochan No science on your side period. 	#NonBinary =#AntiScience
@fox_of_floof @princess_stef69 @Camomochan The proof needs to be on you to prove this. You have probably over 6 billion people in the world right now that would call you crazy. Do you think anyone in Russia, China, Africa would agree with you? With the exception of a small minority?
@fox_of_floof @princess_stef69 @Camomochan If you want to change the entire structure of the world and they way they have been for millions of years  you better be damn well sure your right. So far I'm not even remotely convinced
@fox_of_floof @princess_stef69 @Camomochan Weizmann Institute of Science: studied the human genome, discovered no less than 6,500 different genes that would be either male or female
@fox_of_floof @princess_stef69 @Camomochan It's says they change from female to male. How is that not clear. There is no ambiguous middle where they can be non binary or gender fluid. It's obvious
@Charr1987 @DineshDSouza @doanfilm @POTUS Does God put all of our leaders in charge of this country or just some?
@fox_of_floof @princess_stef69 @Camomochan Nice try, a wrasse will actually change from female to male in a specific case so would be considered transgender not non binary. Try again
@fox_of_floof @princess_stef69 @Camomochan Why would the burden of proof be on me when a random miniscule minority has decided to create an in between gender out of thin air!
@fox_of_floof @princess_stef69 @Camomochan The PsychToday mentions "scant research" when referring to NonBinary. And both are using purely anecdotal cases not science. BIOLOGY 101- There are 2 sexes. Therefore 2 genders. You do not find more then 2 sexes in the animal kingdom
@Charr1987 @DineshDSouza @doanfilm @POTUS Why did God pick this one?
Why are some gender activists denying science? /via @globeandmail https://t.co/N5uhoGf8Nh

@Charr1987 @DineshDSouza @doanfilm @POTUS Lies, conspiracy theories, dividing our country, saying horrible things about other people. Things things don't bother you?
@fox_of_floof @princess_stef69 @Camomochan You have proven nothing. Your straw man argument that a small minority of cultures had this, so what? Just because a culture has a specific trend doesn't make it right.
@OnPlanetDiscord @DineshDSouza @dchagemann @doanfilm I guess for me it's more about character. Trump has a daily tendency to tell lies and spread conspiracy theories. He has divides this country more then anyone. He has made sexist and racism comments. unfaithful to his wife, etc. Need I go on?
@fox_of_floof @princess_stef69 @Camomochan Just because you find more then 2 genders in a small minority of cultures doesn't make it right or accurate. Other cultures have cannibalism, female genital mutilation, incest which in their culture is considered fine. Your argument has no basis
@fox_of_floof @princess_stef69 @Camomochan Since there are only 2 sexes there can only be 2 genders. It has been this way for millions of years.
@mystery_butt @BashfulBulba First, explain to me how America is now a fascist state? 	 I am VERY against Trump and all he stands for but fascism? 	And you still haven't explained how any of these actions: tires, potato, glass, etc. Will do anything. Walk me through it
@mystery_butt @baph0meat @BashfulBulba @OwenMacdonald8 No one checks their exhaust before driving away. And carbon monoxide is odorless, tasteless etc
@mystery_butt @baph0meat @BashfulBulba @OwenMacdonald8 Any type of violence should the very last course of action. And it would have to be an extreme case, like a marxist totalitarian regime or fascist regime in power that's killing people.
@mystery_butt @baph0meat @BashfulBulba @OwenMacdonald8 Putting a potato in an exhaust can kill the person inside the car
@mystery_butt @baph0meat @BashfulBulba @OwenMacdonald8 Yeah, and that's really going to make that ICE agent make the call to the president and have him change his mind.
@mystery_butt @baph0meat @BashfulBulba @OwenMacdonald8 No one died in the Boston Tea Party and there was no violence there. 	And are you really comparing this to the French Revolution? 	Wow.
@mystery_butt @baph0meat @BashfulBulba @OwenMacdonald8 Speak out and protest of course, but to revert to violence or property damage helps no one. It just hurts the cause because as soon as people see violence they will turn you off.
@baph0meat @BashfulBulba @OwenMacdonald8 Bleach in gas tanks? Knifing tires? Potato in exhaust ( which can kill)? 	Are these really going to do anything besides making people angry? This is not how to change society
@baph0meat @BashfulBulba @OwenMacdonald8 As they were under Obama and Bush and Clinton. 	 I'm not saying it's right.....	The only difference is that Trump has increased the amount of children
