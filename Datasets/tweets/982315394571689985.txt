@BretBaier The deficit. Why are we spending so much money that we don’t have? We are spending billions on tech the Chinese had 10 thousand years ago. Social security is up a creek. Student loans are the new bubble. What happens when millions of people just stop paying?

@mitchellvii There are so many fallacies in this tweet I don’t know where to start. It’s like you found something about yourself you didn’t like, so instead of fixing yourself, you projected onto “liberals”.
@therealroseanne When you say things like “always” people feel you are minimizing the hurt felt after reading some of your more insensitive tweets. 		I don’t think any language or speech should be off limits, but we should take great care to make sure we aren’t hurting others with those words.
