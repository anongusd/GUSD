When you don’t accept what you can’t change, you are chained to it. Let go, and set yourself free.
Your thoughts create reality.
When you have exhausted all possibilities, remember this - you haven’t.
Dear God, keep working on me.
Make a man respect your time, mind, and your body. Don’t ever let a man mistreat you, ignore you, feed you lies, having you feeling empty. Learn how to cut ties with a toxic man. Get you a man that values you. There’s nothing wrong wanting to be treated right.
Don’t stray away from yourself to get closer to someone else.
Don’t allow your wounds to transform you into someone you are not.
