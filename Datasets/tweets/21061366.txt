I pledge to help our new Congress restore the people’s faith in our government and in our commitment to listen and to work together. May we all find time to come together with our friends and family, remembering what is most important and recommitting to the fight ahead in 2019.
The irony of depriving so many of their livelihood during the season of giving and peace is just too cruel. I hope this administration will listen to the people it serves and stop recklessly gambling on a wall we don’t want.
While some of us enjoy restful and restorative time-off together — whether you’re observing Christmas, Kwanzaa, or just time away from the daily grind — my thoughts are with those who were forced out of work by this government shutdown.
Remember that the president promised a shutdown if he didn't get what he wants. It's reckless and wrong for him to hold the government hostage for not getting his way. #TrumpShutdown https://t.co/edHnc4oCMk

Light a candle for protecting the Mueller investigation.  		Light a candle to save good jobs at GM and elsewhere.  		Light a candle to massively increase our efforts to save our planet from human-caused climate change.  		Do something for justice every single day.
Happy Chanukah to my Jewish friends and to the world. As we approach the darkest time of year, Chanukah reminds us that we can chase away the darkness of oppression with the light and fire of justice. This year, fighting for justice feels like an urgent calling for us all.
And we have an administration in Washington that for two years running has not even mentioned the LGBT community, despite the disproportionate burden it has borne from HIV.
But we have so far to go. Too many poor people around the world still die for lack of treatment. Many continue to be infected because they lack access to education and prevention. We need to redouble our efforts to find a workable vaccine.
In the early years of AIDS, President Reagan wouldn’t even say the word. Since then, leaders as disparate as Rep. Barbara Lee and President George W. Bush helped save millions of lives through government-funded science, education and prevention programs.
28 years ago, I lost my dear friend Greg Witcher to HIV/AIDS. That was before we had the drug cocktails that keep people alive and well. Greg wasted away before my eyes. He wasn’t 35 years old.
Enough of mourning friends and playing catch-up when thousands are needlessly infected and endangered, at great cost to society. On this World AIDS Day, let us pledge to take a brave, open and truly global approach to eradicating this disease.

However, my vote is about the future, not the past. In my judgment, Nancy Pelosi is the steely, patient and strategic leader we need to take maximum advantage of our precious opportunity to turn our great nation in a healthier and more inspiring direction.
I appreciate her historic role as a breaker of glass ceilings. I remember clearly what an effective Speaker she was in the past. I am grateful to her for coming to #MI09 and indeed crisscrossing the nation to help raise the funds needed to take back the majority.
I support @NancyPelosi to be Speaker of the 116th Congress. She is the strongest leader to unite our caucus and help us accomplish the twin tasks of providing strong and fair Congressional oversight and passing positive legislation that shows the way towards a more just America.
I look forward to working with GM, the @UAW, and our other automakers to bring more jobs building the vehicles we drive home, where they belong.
Today’s announcement by @GM dealt a blow to #MI09, our state and our nation. It is time for the U.S. to develop an industrial policy that facilitates the expansion of manufacturing at home, complete with training programs to prepare our workers to fill any job that needs doing.
We have fallen so far from Emma Lazarus to @realDonaldTrump. The most troubling wall is the one in the heart, for it leads to walling off “the other.” We can secure our borders and facilitate orderly asylum processes without losing our humanity. 	https://t.co/CNEPLJqEL9

I am more determined than ever to go to Washington in January and make sure men accused of violating women cannot reach - or remain - in the highest seats of power in the land.
Above all, I fear the Republicans are about to do lasting damage to the status of the Supreme Court itself and its almost sacred place in our democracy.
No matter brave women coming forward with serious allegations so hastily brushed aside. No matter his extremely aggressive, partisan, and almost certainly mendacious performance under oath before the Judiciary Committee.
I am crestfallen that the Republicans in Congress will now clearly put Brett Kavanaugh on the highest court in the land. No matter his extreme views about presidential power, workers’ rights and women’s control over their own bodies.

Kavanaugh’s claim that the allegations against him involve “revenge by the Clintons” is ridiculous. His extreme partisanship and vengefulness are disqualifying. He doesn’t exhibit appropriate judicial temperament.
Rather than answering questions about sexual escapades or excessive drinking, Judge Kavanaugh changes the subject to academics, sports and church. Unfortunately, we all know highly successful people often have drinking problems and engage in sexual misconduct.
Kavanaugh’s over-the-top aggressiveness is suspicious to me.  		The notion that he was owed a hearing “the next day” is simply absurd to anyone who understands how the Senate works, as he does.
I am in awe of Dr. Blasey Ford for coming forward and handling the questions with courage and grace.  It was so obvious that she was answering naturally and honestly and was just a patriotic American caught up in a horrible situation.
I grew more and more frustrated watching the prosecutor nitpick Dr. Blasey Ford!  I am so mad at these senators for refusing to ask their own questions and for refusing to ask the FBI to investigate the growing number of allegations against Brett Kavanaugh.
Watching this, two overwhelming impressions: (1) I believe this woman.  Her testimony is devastating.  (2) I can’t believe these 11 Republican senators, all white men, are hiding behind this female prosecutor rather than having the guts to question Dr. Blasey Ford themselves.
However, if the administration insists on proceeding, a proper FBI investigation to create a basic factual record upon which Senators can rely is obviously an absolute necessity. (5/5)
To be seated on the highest court, one must demonstrate decency, fairness, and respect. A man who repeatedly assaults and mistreats women has no place deciding the fate of women’s health and rights for decades to come. (4/5)
The president should withdraw the nomination for the good of the nation. Serving on the Supreme Court is a privilege—not a right—and there are many other qualified candidates. (3/5)
The notion that any party would try to rush a confirmation vote for a lifetime position of all things—when one, two, three, and perhaps four women are willing to testify that the nominee assaulted them or otherwise engaged in grossly inappropriate conduct, boggles the mind. (2/5)
I believe and support survivors, not as a husband or a father of a daughter, but as a person recognizing the humanity of these women and bravery it takes for them to come forward.		Sexual assault is not a partisan issue. (1/5)

(4/4) A movement is building, and this movement is full of people who will fight to end 60 years of Republican trickle down economics and combat the administration’s transgressions. #BlueWave
(3/4)However, I’m also hopeful because we live in an era where people are finally saying “enough is enough”.
(2/4) I’m heartbroken that we live in a cruel reality where the president strips parents away from their children, puts profits over working class Americans, and does not believe we are all equal in the eyes of God.
(1/4) Happy Fourth of July! This holiday, I’m reflecting on how far we’ve come as a country, but also how much more progress we have to go.
Kicking off the Fourth of July at the Clawson Parade! https://t.co/ODE9FEuJm4

(2/2) After that vote in favor of Gorsuch, he happily overturned 40 years of settled precedent to harm unions — with no evidence that precedent wasn’t working well. It was purely ideological. Actions speak louder than words. #MI09 #SCOTUS

@chrislhayes And I'd be happy to talk with you about it in further detail!
@chrislhayes So yes, it absolutely can be done! And it will be one of my top priorities when I’m elected to Congress.
@chrislhayes The program was enormously popular, with waiting lists in many counties across the state. It was seen as a national model, but more importantly, NWLB helped thousands of Michigan families find a new foothold in our changing economy. More info: https://t.co/7fyBV6dp6v
@chrislhayes NWLB tamed the immense complexity of the federal workforce system, creating simple eligibility criteria (family income below $40,000) and clear benefits (up to $10,000 for two years’ worth of tuition and supports).
@chrislhayes As Michigan’s workforce training leader, I created No Worker Left Behind, the largest experiment by any state in modern times in serious worker training. NWLB put 152,000 unemployed/underemployed Michigan workers back to school for certificates/degrees leading to in-demand jobs.
On the campaign trail, Trump promised to transform our trade policy.  He hasn’t delivered.  And he just passed over trade in a couple of sentences in the #SOTU.  Not a word about putting real protections in NAFTA for Mexican workers.
Does anyone remember a previous American president clapping for himself repeatedly while delivering the State of the Union? #SOTU
“Let’s invest in job training — we really need it.”  Huh? Trump’s budget proposed massive cuts in job training.  That’s the truth. #SOTU
Man who instituted three Muslim bans says he is protecting religious liberty.  Come again? #SOTU
Trump gave 80% of benefits of Republican tax overhaul to the top 1% — and now says he’s helping the middle class.  Thanks a lot! #SOTU #TrumpSellsOut @BoldProgressive
President Trump's plan will shift the financial burden of infrastructure development to our already struggling cities and states while rolling back critical environmental protections. 		That's not an infrastructure plan. That's infrastructure divestment. https://t.co/JymDKn435g
Michigan needs skilled, financially-stable young people to start businesses, put down roots in our communities, and contribute to the economy. We must invest in higher education so that our university graduates aren’t buried in debt when they graduate. https://t.co/6z1ZUq5Mlq
We must focus on improving the lives of all Americans, not intervening in the private – and often painful –  decisions of families facing complicated pregnancies.  #NoAbortionBan https://t.co/U3s5Nn2YVb
It's clear we need stronger Title IX protections, not weaker. Betsy Devos and the Trump administration should be ashamed of their efforts to roll back Title IX, suppress the voices of survivors, and protect the institutions that failed them. https://t.co/DjYG3NWZtE
Restoring the middle class demands that we stop shortchanging our kids. As your congressman, I will advocate for universal public education, starting with preschool and including excellent K-12 schools with well-compensated and respected teachers. https://t.co/5K33kh91IG
It's clear that we need a new movement for working people. We must put what’s good for workers at the center of every policy decision and tear down the system that consolidates wealth at the very top. No more "trickle down." Open the economic floodgates. https://t.co/3i6kk0e9eX
President Trump's rash decision to pull the plug on DACA without providing a path to citizenship has left thousands of young immigrants confused and frightened. Congress must act swiftly to provide stability and a clear path to citizenship for DREAMers. https://t.co/Tv9aSNFFBA
The Women’s March is an uplifting demonstration of strength and power in the wake of the Trump administration's attacks on women’s healthcare, LGBTQ rights, immigrants, and voting rights. If we keep up the energy, we will be poised for change in November. #PowerToThePolls https://t.co/MstVnBk2sF
Today I'm at the Women's March with my family to stand up for women's rights and prepare for the fight ahead. If we maintain this energy and dedication into November, we can take back control of Congress and protect the rights of all. #PowerToThePolls https://t.co/blNMLn4idX

It's past time for Congress to step up and address the devastating opioid epidemic. We've already lost too many. We must act quickly to protect those still struggling with addition and the families that love them. https://t.co/CbV5VnFPoa
A free and open internet fosters entrepreneurship, spurs economic growth, and protects free speech. When I get to Congress, you can count on me to stand up to the telecom and cable industries and protect #NetNeutrality. https://t.co/4xd8QDsU0W
Congressional Republicans should have passed a clean, 10-year extension of CHIP funding months ago. Instead, they've put the health and security of millions of children in jeopardy to gain political leverage in budget talks. It's sickening. https://t.co/vszjzsRNj2
Trump is visiting western PA today, but he has not kept his campaign promise to steel workers. The time to act is now. We must initiate a “Section 232” action and save our steel industry from the flood of subsidized Chinese imports.  https://t.co/UiyKcj5nAi
We must stop disparaging the working poor and put our energy into improving programs that actually increase social mobility. That means increasing access to high-quality health care, education and job training programs. https://t.co/tkONzuGM3n
When I get to Congress, I will work to support our growing energy, agriculture, transportation and health industries. That means investing in a skilled workforce, supporting emerging industry entrepreneurs, and protecting Michigan's natural resources. https://t.co/DBpJ2jWgN2
Michigan stands to lose $13 million in local and state taxes and $400 million in economic activity each year if our DREAMers are deported. We must provide these bright young people with a path to citizenship. https://t.co/jPNFDiaS1T
The CBO just confirmed that reauthorizing funding is not only the morally responsible thing to do, it's also the fiscally responsible move. I urge congressional Republicans to act now to reauthorize funding and ensure the stability of CHIP. https://t.co/HonyaC1sjO
Prevailing wage is one of the building blocks of Michigan’s middle class. Those who attack it are attacking our standard of living and way of life. 		Today I’m standing shoulder to shoulder with the men and women who built our state and are a key to our future. https://t.co/Vwdwp0D73Z

More than 650,000 Michiganders rely on community health centers for primary/preventative care. If Congress doesn't act, some centers may close and patients will be left with nowhere to turn for affordable care.	Congress must reinstate funding immediately. https://t.co/43Upq7GauA
