Everyone is talking about how crazy the #CPAC19 keynote speaker was. What about the sycophants in the crowd who egged him on for 2 hours?
@RandPaul YOUR party squawked for 8 years about Obama’s expansive executive power, but now is totes cool with what trump is doing. Just like with their prior concern about the debt, the GOP has proven to be total hypocrites.

@RepMarkMeadows Good. So the next Dem POTUS will have broad GOP support to protect Americans from gun violence. Glad to hear it.
@ChrisMurphyCT If only it were that simple, I’d absolutely take that trade. I hate the wall, but I hate guns more.
If trump’s Republican enablers in Congress and the courts allow him to do this, I look forward to their silence and compliance when it’s our turn for guns and climate. 🤣 (As if they’d let us play by their rules.) #ActualNationalEmergency
Saw an old Ben Carson for Pres bumper sticker today. After I got the eye rolling and hysterical laughing out of my system, I felt nothing but pity for the poor soul.
@RandPaul Republicans lost the right to complain about the debt when they introduced the #GOPTaxScam.
@CherylStrayed Yes. Look at all we did after 9/11. It’s horrible that 3000 people died that day, but guns take the lives of 40,000 people every year and we do nothing!
