@JackiSchechner @Jim_Jordan @MarkMeadows @mattgaetz I'm sure that running in multiple districts simultaneously would violate some rules, so you'd have to run as a Republican.
@yashar Thank YOU sir! You helped a lot of people today.

@Goldnmyear @HoarseWisperer @katgal2 The reason that there is so much crime to document, is because it went on for a very long time. So, yes, people do wonder why it takes so much time, and so many crimes before "white collar criminals" wear a pair of handcuffs.

@TeaPainUSA It is unreasonable to believe that coincidences do not exist, though perfectly sane to think that this isn't one of them.
@joncoopertweets Republicans aren't the ones that need to worry. Any race that is less than a landslide victory for the Dem. will be contested in the courts. Kavanaugh isn't there to protect trump, he's there to maintain the GOP majority, and they will protect trump.
@davidmweissman Who?
@djrothkopf @Richard111550 No, most people won't even realize why Kavanaugh is on the court until sometime in mid-December. (Hint: it's so that the GOP candidate "wins" contested races that will be called for the Dem on 11/6, and they will contest enough of them to maintain their majority.)

@sdward1 @Brasilmagic Not taxpayer dollars, imaginary dollars. It's a big on promises, short on payment con.
@jskj9121 @Brasilmagic Right, this just puts their minds at ease until after the election.
@Brasilmagic Yes, and the roll out is timed so that he can say that he is going to help, but they "need to work on the details" until after the election. Then, no money. He's done this con hundreds of times.
@hardball @DelPercioS @JillWineBanks @DavidCornDC @Yamiche No question about obstruction. Yeah that sounds about right.
@MuthrBear @goblin_lord @Stonekettle You're thinking short term and small scale, it's much bigger than that.
@Kerry2wolves @Stonekettle I forget, was "1984" supposed to be a warning, or an instruction manual?
@madchefred @Stonekettle Top of the ninth, but yeah, here we go!
@MuthrBear @Stonekettle Embarrassingly obvious if you think that it's just about him and his ego, and that if (when) the Dems win, they will take their seats and we continue with politics as usual. Not likely. At a minimum there will be contested races going to the courts, the ones that they packed.
@MuthrBear @goblin_lord @Stonekettle Remember that he was still talking about voter fraud even after the inauguration! People were asking why the would the winner be complaining about a rigged election. Because it's not about winning (that surprised them too), it's about creating doubt about our elections &amp; leaders.
@MichaelJElston @bobcesca_go They will grumble about it all the way to the bank.
@McQzan @samsnow53 @SethAbramson That is the plan. To make you suspicious, to question the results, to wonder who is really in charge. Confusion and chaos.
@TheRickWilson Oh, are we still pretending that trump actually wants to make America great, but that he's just not very good at it?
@Realpresident2 @NolanDMcCaskill Yes! And the GOP is setting up this narrative so that when the Dems win, they can call for recounts and court challenges. Russia doesn't care about Ds and Rs, only confusion and chaos.
@macinjay @jedshug @McDeereUSA Probably won't postpone the elections, but they will contest the results. They will keep them tied up in recounts and court fights. Many close races could be flipped. Why was he nominating questionable people these seats again? It wasn't about Roe v. Wade!
@Amy_Siskind It's a continuation of the "election was rigged" propaganda that he was putting out before and after the election, even after he was inaugurated! People were wondering why the winner would be complaining about election fraud, this is why.
@funder The kicker is that even if there is a smooth transfer of power in Congress, our adversaries still benefit when we have a split government. We spend resources fighting amongst ourselves while they have decades long strategic continuity.
@funder Trying to raise confusion and doubt about the entire election process, and who is really in charge. It also gives cover to protest results and keep things tied up in recounts and the courts. Don't be surprised when many close races are called one way and then switched.

@bobcesca_go It's not about foreign policy. It's about sowing doubt about the entire election process, and creating division and confusion in the U.S.
@Rschooley No, Russia didn't conspire to help the GOP. Russia attacked to hurt the U.S.A. Their method is division, by helping unpopular candidates, and by flipping the party in control as often as possible, so that no cohesive strategy forms.
@davidmweissman @sarahkendzior @jelani9 The last hope for that would have been the electoral college understanding their role, and not electing trump. Any sane choice from either party would have taken action to secure our elections.

@GwailoMD @chica64 @TheRickWilson About a month ago, an Indiana farmer said to me, "Trump is trying to fix it, he's better than the last guy." I figure that in the fall, he'll find out just what kind of a fix he's in.
@TheRickWilson Whether it is a win or not largely depends on the goal. If you assume that the goal is for farmers to prosper, then no. If the goal is to advance Russia's interest, well you were warned that you would get tired of all of the winning.

@ednasdiner @RickShaw2017 @Dori_Kenneally @2B4USAll @matthewjdowd I'm not surprised that you see it that way. People who are prone to reading the bible in whatever way they feel suits their own narrative, have no trouble at all with twisting tweets.

@nwmtnguy @tinahseattle @LauraMntsprg @BoycottUtah @SocialPowerOne1 The fantasy isn't building a better America, keeping our democracy and regaining our values. It's in thinking that it will happen without a struggle.

@BoycottUtah @nwmtnguy @tinahseattle @LauraMntsprg @SocialPowerOne1 No, not a thing, just trying to get a jump on the market.
@mudshark23 @radioramin @Brasilmagic That would make it look partisan, and it's not guaranteed to happen anyway. In the meantime lives are being affected every day and if tRump shouldn't be in office, then his removal should happen ASAP.
@nwmtnguy @tinahseattle @LauraMntsprg @BoycottUtah @SocialPowerOne1 Do we all get our own unicorn is your fantasy? I hope you're right, I just want to know if I should go long in the unicorn feed market.
@mudshark23 @radioramin @Brasilmagic I agree with you about Sessions, but the narrative about Mueller simply taking his time to make sure that i's are dotted and t's are crossed is starting to wear very thin.
@radioramin @Brasilmagic If tRump was in as much trouble as we hear that he should be, then he has one goal. To stay out of prison! If he thought that Mueller was going to be the man to put him there, he would fire him. Why would he care about the politics if he thought he was going to prison for life?
@ednasdiner @RickShaw2017 @Dori_Kenneally @2B4USAll @matthewjdowd This post highlights another prevalent traits of evangelicals. The need to feel persecuted. If you feel that my experiences with other people (that you do not know) is an insult to you then that is on you. If it is about my "Absolutely" reply, you asked.
@ednasdiner @RickShaw2017 @Dori_Kenneally @2B4USAll @matthewjdowd Four OUT OF TWELVE!! That is also just the ones that said that exact phrase, not all of them. There is one that I am confident is not though, so you've got that on your side.

@ednasdiner @RickShaw2017 @Dori_Kenneally @2B4USAll @matthewjdowd WAS friends with...
@ednasdiner @RickShaw2017 @Dori_Kenneally @2B4USAll @matthewjdowd Absolutely.
@Brasilmagic Let's see the proof.
@ednasdiner @RickShaw2017 @Dori_Kenneally @2B4USAll @matthewjdowd I  have these conversations with my co-workers. They think that I am one of them, so they speak freely. They guess that I believe that all African Americans act like Al Sharpton, all Irish are drunks, etc. too. Like yours, their guesses are wrong.
@ednasdiner @RickShaw2017 @Dori_Kenneally @2B4USAll @matthewjdowd You seem to think that I have never been anything but an outsider to them. That is not the case. These are not "bad apples" that I watched from afar, they were my best friends. The conversations about those things took place face to face with me in their dining rooms!
@ednasdiner @RickShaw2017 @Dori_Kenneally @2B4USAll @matthewjdowd Stereotyping is only ugly if the stereotype has a negative connotation. If you feel that those traits are negative, then why do you keep them? Your estimate that 98% of evangelicals display none of those traits shows that you are not looking, at all.
@ednasdiner @RickShaw2017 @Dori_Kenneally @2B4USAll @matthewjdowd So seeing things as you wish they were, isn't just about bible verses or reading in general?
@ednasdiner @RickShaw2017 @Dori_Kenneally @2B4USAll @matthewjdowd My point is, that while it is possible that not every member has those traits in common, an appropriately sized brush will probably be rather large.
@ednasdiner @RickShaw2017 @Dori_Kenneally @2B4USAll @matthewjdowd My post also says that Dori and I probably don't know any of the same people. That alone suggests that neither of us could know them all. People that distrust education, and only believe as they are told to, tend to miss logical arguments.
@ednasdiner @RickShaw2017 @Dori_Kenneally @2B4USAll @matthewjdowd My post SPECIFICALLY SAYS that the scope of Dori's post is limited, and therefore mine is too. Yet somehow you STILL misread "all that I know" as "we both know them all"? Clearly bible verses are not the only thing that you read however you want.
@whiteherron @ProudResister There's a level of optimism that you just don't see every day.
@ProudResister It's as if the blue/black vs white/gold dress problem went nuclear.
@RickShaw2017 @Dori_Kenneally @2B4USAll @matthewjdowd "The evangelicals I know" part of the statement establishes and limits the size of the brush. Though the rest of the statement matches my experience also, and Dori and I probably don't know any of the same people.

@SouthOVegas @dacarnes @ananavarro I would be ok it the customer said "I want a cross shaved into my hair" and the hairdresser said, "I don't do that."
@johnsoj2 @SouthOVegas @dacarnes @ananavarro 99% chance it was the people. And I think that he is wrong for that. I  simply do not like the idea of being compelled under threat of law to be creative.
@johnsoj2 @SouthOVegas @dacarnes @ananavarro I would think that a jewelry maker, dress maker and maybe hair stylist would be in the same situation as the baker. I agree with the distinction between premade and custom though.
@johnsoj2 @SouthOVegas @dacarnes @ananavarro I agree, and that is what is different here. It isn't an off the shelf item, but a custom piece of art.
@SouthOVegas @dacarnes @ananavarro It's not the cake that is the issue, it's the decorating of it. So where do you want the line to be drawn? I can command you to make anything that I want, as long as I'm not going to put it in a museum, with the force of law backing me up?
@SouthOVegas @dacarnes @ananavarro A random customer should not be able to require an artist to create something that they do not want to.
@ananavarro I wouldn't buy one made by ppl who think someone else might be going to hell because of who they love either.

@mxgoldie @CindiRight @cccapone @AGSchneiderman Please note though, I am not saying that the baker was/is right, just that he should have the right to refuse to do creative work for any reason, or no reason at all.
@mxgoldie @CindiRight @cccapone @AGSchneiderman You are incorrect. They wanted a very well decorated cake to celebrate a wedding. You don't offer to spend big bucks at a place called Masterpiece Cakes if just any old flour and sugar mix will do. So where do you want to draw the line where the g'ment says you HAVE TO create?
@mxgoldie @CindiRight @cccapone @AGSchneiderman I personally don't agree with the baker here, but I don't think that the government should force artists to accept any and all requests that come through the door.
@mxgoldie @CindiRight @cccapone @AGSchneiderman It's not about the cake, it's about the decorations. A better example might be going to a painter that specializes  in still life, and demanding that they paint a massacre scene for you. Same ingredients, different message.

@UriBlago @DavidWalker991 First, your "fact" is wrong. It's actually 17. Second, your thought process puts equal weight of record highs happening in winter and summer
@UriBlago @DavidWalker991 If every city in northern California set a new record, you would still claim no warming because none of them beat Death Valley 6/10/1913.
@UriBlago @DavidWalker991 Does it really matter? If we were seeing a new all-time high in several states every year, you would simply find another stat to latch onto
@UriBlago @DavidWalker991 This article is about record highs for the MONTH of FEBRUARY. Your "77 * 365 * 50" argument only takes into consideration ALL TIME highs.
@DavidWalker991 @UriBlago Multiplying 77 * 365 * 50... means that you give Minnesota the same odds of setting an all-time record high on Feb 1 as Aug 15.

@SC_longhorn @washingtonpost Maybe DT says they cannot. You are believing a source whose goal is to instill fear... it's working.
@SC_longhorn @washingtonpost Wrong, that is a DT lie.
@SC_longhorn @washingtonpost Now that is foolish!
@SC_longhorn @washingtonpost Maybe I am not afraid of people that look different than I do.
@SC_longhorn @washingtonpost Maybe I understand the 18 to 24 month vetting process that refugees go through.
@SC_longhorn @washingtonpost Maybe I like the idea of millionaires paying at least the same tax rate as a working person.
@SC_longhorn @washingtonpost Name calling, deflection, and pleading for it to stop. Is this a trumpettes version of a policy discussion?
@SC_longhorn @washingtonpost Actually, if he would've tried to stick to policies, he would've been laughed out of the Rep. primaries.
@Arnaud5566 @alivitali Financiers that make a living in real estate were conned by DT, these people are like fish in a barrel to him.
@SC_longhorn @washingtonpost Yeah, HRC would've dominated if they had discussed policies. DT had no choice but to go this way. GL2u2 lol.
@SC_longhorn @washingtonpost DT doesn't have policies, he has slogans. Does it feel good when you fall for them?
@SC_longhorn @washingtonpost Again, in a couple of weeks, when you are caught up to current events, you might see things differently.
@SC_longhorn @washingtonpost I think that in the coming weeks, you are going to find out that one of those statements is not true.
@chixenman @washingtonpost Look at who is doing the homework all of a sudden. Now, go ahead and ask again...
@chixenman @washingtonpost I didn't say Bill wasn't accused, I asked you WHEN he was accused, so you could find out when it was covered 24/7
@chixenman @washingtonpost No hard evidence besides his taped confession?
@chixenman @washingtonpost @CNN Were you on the jury? Did you vote to convict?
@chixenman @washingtonpost You are either too young to remember, or lived under a rock!!
@chixenman @washingtonpost It was in the 1990s, so that is when the 24/7 coverage was!
@SC_longhorn @washingtonpost If 30yo accusations shouldn't be a factor, why are Bills issues that were settled 30 years ago? Distraction!
@978stargal @washingtonpost Why don't you believe the reports when charges have been debunked?
@chixenman @washingtonpost When was Bill Clinton accused?
@survivinglife3 @JamiHarlow @kurteichenwald Was it truthful?
@survivinglife3 @JamiHarlow @kurteichenwald Does the wiki explain how HRC got DT to admit this behavior 11 years ago? ON TAPE!
@survivinglife3 @JamiHarlow @kurteichenwald Trump is now saying that he didn't do what he said he did. That means he is a liar.
@survivinglife3 @JamiHarlow @kurteichenwald She said that he did what he said that he does. Are you saying that they are both liars?
@johnaita @aadyaroshan I agree that congress surrendered its authority, but that is certainly not the fault of the prez.
@johnaita @aadyaroshan And with that power, Obama had fewer exec. orders and vetos than any prez. since Kennedy. Even 1 term Carter! Abuse?
@johnaita @aadyaroshan Your posts and arguments so far suggest that your opinions are based EXCLUSIVELY on a narrow band of media.
@johnaita @aadyaroshan If you believe nothing that the media says, then why would you post a link to a media site?
@johnaita @aadyaroshan I don't care what you are buying, or not. I am new to Twitter, not to the internet. Defend your posts, or don't.
@johnaita @aadyaroshan That is true, so what makes you think that Hillary, or anyone else can act unilaterally? Raw motivation??
@johnaita @aadyaroshan Prez. Obama is fulfilling his constitutional obligation, the senate is not (yet).
@johnaita @aadyaroshan Fake? No. Paid? Unfortunately, no. Now, were you really arguing, or just slinging stuff to see what would stick?
@johnaita @aadyaroshan Are you aware that the republican senate is refusing to hold hearings on a justice to fill a SCOTUS opening?
@johnaita @aadyaroshan You have been lead by the nose to the trough, having never looked up to see where you were going. Now eat pig, eat!
@johnaita @aadyaroshan No you didn't. You were told that you did by the media that you chose to watch and listen to, and you believed it.
@johnaita @aadyaroshan Want to take a guess at who the one citizen in the entire country that has no vote in changing an amendment?
@johnaita @aadyaroshan They think such stupid things as "If X is Prez, then they will abolish Amendment Y".
@johnaita @aadyaroshan That is the problem with trumpers, they have no clue. They think that the prez can just do whatever they want.
@johnaita @aadyaroshan Do you have any idea about how the U.S. government works?
@johnaita @aadyaroshan Yes you are correct, media BS, totally fake and obvious. We just differ on which media is BS.
@johnaita @aadyaroshan That she has complete control over everyone in the entire government. REALLY??
@johnaita @aadyaroshan You can either believe that she is relatively honest and trustworthy, OR...
@johnaita @aadyaroshan whats fabricated ? he bragged about it on taped and broadcast interviews, and now has witness testimony
@johnaita @aadyaroshan trump dragged the race into the mud on the escalator ride down to his announcement speech! Where have you been?
@johnaita @aadyaroshan But the obviously fabricated nonsense about HILLARY (the Clinton on the ballot) is ok though? Yeah, it's you.
@onemordumazz @thinkprogress He is being accused of doing what he was bragging about doing, and thinks that makes him look bad.
@bilibidon @thinkprogress According to the trump people, two of them are donors to the Clinton campaign.
@sweetatertot2 @mungkorn88xs From 0:59 to 1:01 DT: "He (Cheney) said the war was going fantastically just a few months ago...)
@sweetatertot2 @mungkorn88xs How would he have known in early 2003 that the war was a catastrophe?
