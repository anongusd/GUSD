Elwell: A spirit of partnership, and willingness to embrace technology, is what‚Äôs going to help us safely integrate #drones, #CommercialSpace vehicles, #supersonic aircraft, and modern air traffic control equipment into our airspace. #NATCACFS2018
Elwell: Our nation‚Äôs #AirTrafficControllers are on the front lines of our #airspace system. Their expertise and professionalism are an essential piece of our unprecedented safety record. #NATCACFS2018
Elwell: There‚Äôs no question the next generation of #supersonic #aircraft technology is coming, and the #FAA intends to be ready. The bill empowers us to be a global leader in the development of international supersonic aircraft policies, regulations, &amp; standards. #NATCACFS2018
Elwell: #CommercialSpace is also a high priority when every year is another record-breaker for launches. The #FAA licensed 32 launches and 3 reentries in Fiscal Year 2018, and demand is only going to keep growing. #NATCACFS2018
Elwell: #Unmanned aircraft have almost unlimited potential with a unique set of challenges. How do we monitor thousands of #drones safely in our system? We will continue to work with #controllers and #industry to find the best way. #NATCACFS2018
Elwell: The #FAA Reauthorization Bill gives us a clear vision for the next five years, and a road map for navigating the future that‚Äôs speeding our way. Emerging #technologies are on all of our minds and at the forefront of this bill. #NATCACFS2018

Hassan Shahidi, @MITREcorp: There needs to be an international standard when it comes to the #cybersecurity of drones. #ATCA63
Rocheleau: At the end of the day, data will inform our decisions. #ATCA63
Rocheleau: The #supersonic technology and the resources are compelling. It‚Äôs time to invest energy and look at opportunities. The FAA is a more progressive regulator than we were 10-20 years ago. #ATCA63
Rocheleau: You want to think long term about #drones and we think the integration approach is right. We want to share those experiences. #ATCA63
Rocheleau: We‚Äôve done a lot in the drone space, specifically with integration. #CommecialSpace, launches have gone from once a year to once a week, which is a lot of work for the regulator. On #supersonic, we want to be a part of it. #ATCA63

Prevot: We can start operating but need more. We will learn a lot from 4G and 5G from #drone testing. #ATCA63
Bradford: Do we have to move to a new paradigm? #ATCA63
David Rottblatt, @Embraer: Until tests prove that 4G and 5G is reliable, in terms of Runway Incursion Prevention we‚Äôll be taking advantage of other technologies, such as #ADSB Out and In. #ATCA63
Christine: To recoup some of the lost revenue from parking, there will need to be partnerships with companies like @Uber. As those technologies start to grow, we‚Äôll need to grow those partnerships. #ATCA63
Jack Christine, @CLTAirport: There are some challenges with autonomous vehicles using the airport. Our parallel runways are in close proximity, so it may look like they land somewhere else on the airport. We‚Äôre looking at some sort of people mover to accommodate this. #ATCA63

Burleson: A lot of trends are not influenced by aviation, but there‚Äôs crossover. in technology. Who would have thought that an iPad and would be in the cockpit with a GA pilot? Maybe the engineers we lose today to Silicon Valley will circle back. #ATCA63
Burleson: How do we work together, as the aviation industry, to manage risk? The issue for us is that there are a variety of ways people assess risk. The new users think about it as test and fail, but we‚Äôre more cautious as regulators. #ATCA63
Burleson: The FAA‚Äòs has an amazing air traffic control #infrastructure, and we have all the new users in our airspace. A program like #LAANC is a good model of how we are working with the private sector. We have to remain creative and flexible to evolve. #ATCA63

Dumont: Can you tell us about the #DronePilot program and commercial space? #ATCA63
Elwell: Becoming a pilot is cost-prohibitive. That‚Äôs why there was so much discussion about financing options at the Aviation Workforce Symposium.  #ATCA63
Dumont: Do you think it‚Äôs an income thing? #ATCA63
Elwell: @AOPA just finished building a four year curriculum. That‚Äôs huge. But, we need to talk to kids long before high school. #ATCA63
Elwell: #Millennials prefer to fly a #drone than get in a cockpit. To me, flying an airplane is better. I think one way to excite young people is to put them in a simulator. It‚Äôs the best video game in the world! #ATCA63
Elwell: We looked at the aviation shortage across the board. And had a really good conversation about how to fix the problem. #STEM #ATCA63
Dumont: The recent Aviation Workforce Symposium, what was that about?#ATCA63
Elwell: We have joined hands in the #UAS revolution with companies like @Google and @Amazon, with companies that are used to making changes in weeks and months. It is a challenge. Collaboration between legacy and new companies is better than it‚Äôs ever been. It has to be. #ATCA63
Elwell: Our goal is to more than keep up. We‚Äôre working with industry to keep up with innovation. Because we‚Äôre cautious with safety, it is a challenge to keep up with industry. But collaboration with these new companies continues to be strong.  #ATCA63
Dumont: Let‚Äôs talk about new entrants. I see programs like #LAANC, which is going very well. Can you keep up with new entrants? #ATCA63

Elwell: Thank you for coming. I really look forward to working with everyone on the aviation workforce issue in the future. #AWS18 https://t.co/a1awowPKm7
Elwell: It's time for a national strategy and it has to be a priority for all of us. It will be a priority for me and for the #FAA. #AWS18
Elwell: Let people know what's available. We need to build better partnerships. Not everyone needs a four year education. #AWS18
Elwell: We have to bring this excitement to the kids. Throw a kid in a full motion simulator! They love video games.  #AWS18
Elwell: Any solution to this problem that doesn't improve safety is not one worth going after. #AWS18
Elwell: What I got out of today is that there is agreement that this is a real and pressing challenge for the industry and it is costing the country and the industry. And, this is a global problem. #AWS18
Elwell: Thank you to all of you for coming today and caring enough to be engaged. #AWS18
Acting #FAA Administrator Dan Elwell: Thank you to @USDOT Secretary Chao and @usairforce Secretary Wilson and to all of our panelists. #AWS18
Jim Brough, @FAANews: Not all #STEM is created equal. It makes for great doctors and scientist. But it doesn‚Äôt focus on aviation programs. #AWS18
Jones: We cannot afford to pass students who don‚Äôt meet our #safety standards. When human lives are at stake, a lower graduation rate is acceptable. #AWS18
Diane Auer Jones, @usedgov: We need to figure out how to attract and harness talent before we lose out on that talent. #AWS18
Our final panel today focuses on next steps and will be led by the #FAA‚Äôs Carl Burleson. #AWS18 https://t.co/SEIVh5RZVM
Isom: Careers in aviation can help minimize the financial risks of college students. Aviation offers viable, economically stable, life changing jobs. Our youth need to be made aware. #AWS18 https://t.co/GZUnte7H5H
Koscal: We need to train for mastery instead of training to a curriculum. #AWS18
Captain Mike McCasky, @united: There are the right uses of technology and there are uses that won‚Äôt add value, in terms of training. #AWS18 https://t.co/czjIFcC8wV
Koscal: We have done a terrible job marketing this career path to youth. We can no longer expect kids interested in #aviation to come to us. Instead, we must start interacting with schools and reaching out to students directly. #AWS18
Koscal: We announced our Lift Academy. It is designed to train students to be commercial ready. #AWS18
Matt Koscal, @RepublicAirline: We also know something about the #pilot supply shortage, and this shortage is only expected to grow. To meet future workforce demands, we need to find new ways to reach a more diversified audience. #AWS18
Dennis Sinnett, @EKU: We cannot compromise on #safety. We are currently experiencing a shortage of certified #flight instructors, and are looking for innovative ways to work with #industry to fill this gap. #AWS18
Robert Isom, @AmericanAir: There has never been a better time to pursue a career as an airline pilot. At #AmericanAirlines, we are committed to diversifying our workforce. #AWS18
Robert Isom, @AmericanAir: It‚Äôs essential that we shine a light on the need for well-trained and experienced #pilots. There‚Äôs no shortage of capable youth. It‚Äôs just a matter of connecting our youth with the right resources and information. #AWS18
Allen: #Funding is critical to the #future of our workforce. Fear of financial #debt is scaring kids away from this #career #AWS18
John Allen, @JetBlue: Everybody has different skills. I emphasize that screening is a good way to determine which career pathway is chosen. #AWS18
Up next, panel 4 on productive partnerships will be moderated by John Allen, @jetblue. #AWS18 https://t.co/2d7WY22wI4
Randy Babbitt: The big takeaway here is that we don‚Äôt want to create a financial filter that prevents competent pilots from joining our workforce. #AWS18
Jon Tovani, @delta: The pilot shortage in #America is an American Problem. We believe in focusing on the local community to help fill the shortage in our workforce. #AWS18
Blair: We have to attract people into the FAA, examining and professional instruction. #AWS18
Bjerke: We are working with #industry partners to emphasize the value of becoming an Evaluator Pilot, to mentor the next generation of pilots. #AWS18
Jangelis: Regarding training, we have to maintain a standard. Time matters. Experience matters. #AWS18
Dr. Sharon DeVivo, @VaughnCollege: To attract more woman and minorities to a career in #aviation, we need to reduce the cost of #education. #AWS18
Dr. Beth Bjerke, @UofNorthDakota: There is growth among young people interested in flight. Simulators go a long way to bringing the technology right to the students. #AWS18
Steve Jangelis, @WeAreALPA: Experience in actual flight, not virtual simulators, is the experience that really matters.  #AWS18
Jason Blair: We can all agree that funding is important. The collegiate environment has done a fantastic job in finding funding. But even more so, we are experiencing a significant shortage of certified flight instructors. #AWS18
Randy Babbitt: The commercial #aviation industry is at a cross roads, and the practices we adopt will have significant ramifications for the future of #aviationsafety and the aviation workforce. #AWS18
Randy Babbitt: I am not interested in maintaining the level of safety we have today, I am interested in improving the level of #safety we have today. We have made advancements in training and training techniques that will allow us to produce safer and more skilled #pilots. #AWS18
Randy Babbitt will lead the next panel: pathways to proficiency, how can we maximize efficiency in training for today‚Äôs National Airspace System? #AWS18 https://t.co/8OvbuwDdID

Blacknall-Jamison: Less talk, more collaboration, [is what‚Äôs needed to make the aviation industry more inviting]. #AWS18
Desmarais: We each had that ah-ha moment. We need to show that it is a cool industry and we need to create that spark. #AWS18
Hasselbring: Let‚Äôs make the aviation community more inviting! #AWS18
Cwayna: Partnerships have been phenomenal. The #aviation companies understand the need. They are passionate. All kids should have access to aviation. #AWS18 https://t.co/lXSQwF0X0Y
Horning: There needs to be a pathway into the industry on the #pilot side, but also on the maintenance side, and that requires an industry partner to take you in and show you what you‚Äôll be doing after you graduate. #AWS18
Desmarais: We have to establish a real	clear pathway and do it early to get kids into the industry. #AWS18
Cindy Hasselbring, @AOPA: We‚Äôre providing students with a long, sustained exposure to #aviation. #AWS18
Horning: We need to have additional #grants and #scholarships available to help get students into this career. There needs to be a partnership between schools and #industry. #AWS18
Blacknall-Jamison: It‚Äôs important to put money behind the words and make #aviation exciting for young people. #AWS18
Vanessa Blacknall-Jamison, @OBAPEXCELLENCE: OBAP has seen over 40,000 students this year. We help the industry hire individuals and set them up for success. #AWS18
John Desmarais, @CivilAirPatrol: We offer career inspiration programs to our cadets. #AWS18
Sean Elliot, @EAA: Kid Venture at #AirVenture saw 20,000 kids come through this year. #AWS18
Cwayna: Do you ask your children if they want to be in #aviation? I believe in a grassroots effort. #AWS18
Pat Cwayna, @wmaviation: Our school is focused on #STEM and aviation. Young people are interested in aviation, we  just have to ask them about it. #AWS18
Chuck Horning, @EmbryRiddle: There is no shortage of kids interested in #aviation. The challenge is helping our youth understand aviation maintenance and view it as a viable career choice. #AWS18

Secretary Chao: We are here today to create a win for #consumers and for the #AviationIndustry by highlighting issues and discussing this critical need together to remain a global leader in aviation. @AWS18
Secretary Chao: Local communities are getting involved as well. Signature Flight Support @FlyHSV created a non-profit FlyQuest providing scholarships for #aviation-oriented courses ‚Äì it even has a mobile classroom. #AWS18
Secretary Chao: @USDOT continues to support programs, like Forces to Flyers, and initiatives to encourage youth and military #veterans, and provide the education and training needed to join our industry. #AWS18
Secretary Chao: This #AviationWorkforce Symposium brings together the #FAA, @usedgov, @USDOL, @DeptofDefense and all stakeholders. #AWS18
Secretary Chao: We need more aviation #mechanics, logistics specialists, electronics #technicians and #pilots ‚Äì the backbone of this industry. #AWS18
Secretary Chao: The increase in air passengers is expected to nearly double by 2036 creating many job opportunities in the #AviationIndustry. #AWS18
Secretary Chao: Yesterday marked the 40th anniversary of #airline deregulation, creating an all-time high of domestic and international passengers last year. @IATA predicts the numbers will only increase. #AWS18
Secretary Chao: #HurricaneFlorence is being monitored closely by the Administration and cabinet secretaries. #AWS18
.@USDOT Secretary Elaine Chao: Thank you Dan Elwell for leading the FAA, @SecAFOfficial Heather Wilson, @AmericanAir President Robert Isom, @eku Aviation Coordinator Dennis Sinnett, and the representatives here from the #aviation industry. #AWS18
.@USDOT Secretary Elaine Chao will now deliver the keynote address. #AWS18 https://t.co/Yu3og4LKpt
Secretary Wilson: It‚Äôs time for a national strategy. We need a new vectoring and a new airspeed. #AWS18
Secretary Wilson: National strategy starts with the people in this room. We need to increase pathways for young aviators. It‚Äôs time to start. #AWS18
Secretary Wilson: We are improving skills, we are learning things ourselves, and now we are able to share those ideas. #AWS18
Secretary Wilson:  The opportunities for #VR and simulation is far better than 10 years ago. I commend the #FAA for allowing more time for simulation in training. #AWS18
Secretary Wilson: Using simulation and #VirtualReality, we can take #pilots and monitor their vital signs; monitor stress-levels that are limited in #real-life. #AWS18
Secretary Wilson: Give students requirements to #master instead of a set syllabus; let them work themselves in their own way. #AWS18
Secretary Wilson: We are bringing together high school kids, @USAirForce cadets from #ROTC and @AF_Academy, and brand new #mechanics, to build the interest to fly through mentoring. #AWS18
Secretary Wilson: We have partnerships with @EAA, @AOPA, @WomenInAviation and others. #AWS18
Secretary Wilson: Looking at our #aviators, we are underrepresented by #women and #minorities. We need to engage with them where they are. #AWS18
Secretary Wilson: Most #airmen dreamed to fly in elementary school ‚Äì for #women and #minorities it happens later. We need to find out when. #AWS18
Secretary Wilson:  At the @usairforce, we‚Äôve changed the training syllabus for #pilots and removed overlapping training. #AWS18
Secretary Wilson: We have to be in it together. If we cannibalize each other, we will continue the national shortage. #AWS18
.@SECAF Dr. Heather Wilson: Demand is increasing for pilots, and it‚Äôs outpacing the supply. #AWS18
Secretary Wilson: The @usairforce was 2000 Pilots short last year. #AWS18
Joining us now is @USAIrForce Secretary Dr. Heather Wilson. #AWS18 https://t.co/jpLmtzBRax

Novak: We are importing pilots when we have a shortage, and we‚Äôre exporting pilots when we have a shortage. We are losing pilots to overseas markets. #AWS18
Rosen: To what extent does the international environment affect the supply issue? #AWS18 https://t.co/JAajVVLZX3
Levanto: In terms of mechanics, we need to be more holistic in how we think about workforce. #AWS18
Slazer: When you start becoming cutting edge, and doing things people haven‚Äôt seen before, that‚Äôs when you draw attention. #AWS18
Rosen: What about recruitment and retention in the near term? #AWS18
Lenss: We have to work on exposing young people to programs that will inspire love for aviation. #AWS18
Novak: The workforce shortage is both a long-term problem and a short-term problem. #AWS18
Major General Donald R. Lindberg, @USAirForce: There‚Äôs a pilot shortage in the Air Force. Pilot retention is a problem. #AWS18
Brett Levanto, @ARSA: The inability to find technical workers is costing us billions of dollars a year. There will be fewer technicians in the market than the demand by 2022. By 2027, the market will be nine percent short. #AWS18
Lenss: Lowering financial barriers to training is crucial. #AWS18
Marty Lenss, @Fly_cid: Due to the decreasing workforce, regional airlines are most at-risk. Communities that are serviced by regional airlines fall off the grid.  #AWS18
Slazer: We‚Äôre reaching out 6th-8th graders to introduce them to #STEM. What level of math they choose will impact what college they get into. #AWS18
Frank Slazer, @AIASpeaks: All of #aviation has the same #STEM foundation. Our demographics are not the numbers of America. We need to reach out to communities that statistically are not represented in the #aerospace industry. #AWS18
Bernstein: There is also a shortage of flight instructors. It‚Äôs going to take a multitude of ideas to find solutions. #AWS18
Bernstein: We‚Äôre dealing with a new generation of pilots. We work with colleges and flight schools and bring them up through the program. But we are still facing shortages. #AWS18
Stan Bernstein, RACCA: We‚Äôre the first stop for a new pilot. They stay with us for 2-3 years before they move on to a major air carrier. #AWS18
Novak: It‚Äôs going to take a multifaceted approach to address this problem. We want to see creative solutions, and it requires cooperation. #AWS18
George Novak, NACA: The problem is not hypothetical. It‚Äôs here. Europe and Asia are in front of the Unites States on creative solutions. This is a is a pilot supply issue. We need to look at what @icao is doing. #AWS18
Jeffrey Rosen, @USDOT:  We need to meet the needs of the industry; our standards need to produce a workforce to support innovation. #AWS18
Next up: @USDOT Deputy Rosen will moderate our first panel which will set the scene for the day: What is the scope of the challenge? How does it look from your perspective? #AWS18 https://t.co/j7g2hzFQDp
Dan Elwell: We‚Äôve got the best of the best here with us today. I know we‚Äôll be able to come up with actions to ensure America maintains a robust #pilot supply. #AWS18
Dan Elwell: It‚Äôs not enough to maintain our current level of #safety. We need to actively improve on it. #AWS18
Dan Elwell: The #FAA has a responsibility to ensure the safety of our #aviation system, and that our nation‚Äôs #pilots receive the best training and are held to the highest standards. #AWS18
Dan Elwell: How can we improve training and build new and existing partnerships between #airlines, government, and academia to support these efforts? #AWS18
Dan Elwell: We have a diminishing supply of qualified #pilots, #mechanics, and #technicians. We need to be focused on solutions. #AWS18
Dan Elwell: The #military isn‚Äôt turning out new pilots at the same rate it used to. College #aviation programs‚Äô instructors are taking jobs with #airlines instead of continuing to teach. #AWS18
Dan Elwell: Private #pilots holding active airmen certificates decreased by 27% in last 10 years. The number of #CommercialPilots has decreased by 21%. #AWS18
Dan Elwell: @IATA forecasts the number of air passengers traveling will nearly double by 2036. @Boeing projects this growth will require 117,000 new #pilots in North America alone. We need to see interest in #AviationCareers increase. #AWS18
Dan Elwell: #AirTravel in the U.S. and globally is growing at unprecedented rate with no signs of slowing down. #AWS18

Dan Elwell: If you share the #FAA‚Äôs goal of fully integrating #drones into our airspace as soon as possible, don‚Äôt just make the business case for your products or operations, start making the #safety case too. #interdrone https://t.co/NApuKzflrc
Dan Elwell: The fact is, a lot of safety problems require technological solutions. And that means we need buy-in from all of you. The #innovators. The inventers. The out-of-the-box thinkers. https://t.co/Uu6IdnkXGa #interdrone
Dan Elwell: Until we can set remote ID requirements that will be universally applied to every #drone, until we can make sure everyone is following the same rules inside the system, full integration just isn‚Äôt possible. https://t.co/Uu6IdnkXGa #interdrone
Dan Elwell: Everyone‚Äôs interested in #drone operations at night and over people. But we need to address the concerns that our national security and #lawenforcement partners have first. https://t.co/Uu6IdnkXGa #interdrone
Dan Elwell: That‚Äôs a Cabinet-level official who‚Äôs leaning in, and saying: Let‚Äôs move our efforts into the fast lane. https://t.co/Uu6IdnkXGa #interdrone
Dan Elwell: Secretary Chao recently launched the #DronePilot program to let us work with local governments and private industry to figure out how best to expand unmanned operations beyond what‚Äôs allowed by current regulations. https://t.co/Uu6IdnkXGa #interdrone
Dan Elwell: Innovation is one of Secretary Chao‚Äôs top priorities for the Department of Transportation. We‚Äôre building flexible, responsive regulatory processes that can keep up with all your creativity while ensuring safety isn‚Äôt compromised. https://t.co/Uu6IdnkXGa #interdrone
Dan Elwell: If there‚Äôs one thing I want you to tell people, when you get home, it‚Äôs this: the #FAA is open for business. https://t.co/Uu6IdnkXGa #interdrone
Dan Elwell: The FAA has spent decades working with #airlines, manufacturers, and countless others to get where we are now. We‚Äôre ready to use everything we‚Äôve learned so that the #drone industry can reach its full potential as quickly as possible. #interdrone
Dan Elwell: #Aviation is the gold standard. The safest form of transportation in the world. That‚Äôs not a position we‚Äôre about to take a step back on. https://t.co/Uu6IdnkXGa #interdrone
Dan Elwell: The public has very real and justified questions about these aircraft. And, their concerns can‚Äôt just be swept under the rug.  If we want this #technology to take hold, we‚Äôve got to take these questions head on. https://t.co/Uu6IdnkXGa #interdrone

Elwell, #FAA: Working with industry doesn‚Äôt lower the bar on safety. It‚Äôs what allows us to raise it even higher. We‚Äôre going to need these partnerships more than ever if we‚Äôre going to tackle the challenges heading our way. #ASF64
Elwell, #FAA: We work with the airlines to develop safety enhancements that will mitigate risk. This is the most effective way to allow for an open exchange of information while still ensuring compliance. #AFS64
Elwell, #FAA: We‚Äôve set up programs that allow aviation professionals to share critical safety data without fear of punishment. And the information we‚Äôve received has been invaluable. #ASF64
Elwell, #FAA: We all know safety isn‚Äôt just good for business ‚Äì it‚Äôs our only business. That‚Äôs why the FAA and the aviation industry have worked together to create a safety culture. #ASF64
Elwell, #FAA: When an incident occurs in the system, it doesn‚Äôt just happen to one airline. It happens to all of us. #ASF64
Elwell, #FAA: Regulation alone can‚Äôt achieve the kind of results we demand for aviation. We‚Äôre as safe as we are today because we collaborate: airlines, pilots, manufacturers, mechanics, and the FAA. #ASF64
Elwell, #FAA: Aviation didn‚Äôt start out as the safest form of transportation. The earliest years of flight were filled with trial and error‚Ä¶ But today, we‚Äôre the gold standard. #ASF64
Elwell, #FAA: You may not be aware but FAA is hitting a big milestone this month ‚Äì FAA is turning 60. I‚Äôve been reflecting on how far we‚Äôve come ‚Äì not only as an agency, but as a community. #ASF64
#FAA Acting Administrator Dan Elwell: It‚Äôs good to be here today. This feels like a bit of a homecoming to me. As you just heard, I know what it‚Äôs like to be sitting where you are. #ASF64

Smith: Airports must plan to meet Limited English Proficiency (LEP) needs by completing the Four-Factor analysis for number/proportion of LEP persons, frequency of contact with LEP persons, importance of the program/activity, and resources available. #AirportCivilRights
Smith: Once an airport applies for FAA airport improvement funding, any tenant on that property is now subject to the same requirements for Title VI. For example, Unlawful Discrimination posters are required to be posted in the tenant‚Äôs space. #AirportCivilRights
Smith: I-Speak (translation) cards are a useful resource for quickly identifying a person‚Äôs language assistance needs. #AirportCivilRights
Smith: Airports are required to make copies of the Unlawful Discrimination poster available to the public. These should be in the secure and non-secure areas. #AirportCivilRights
Cherry Smith, #FAA: Best practices include non-discrimination training with volunteers, staff, and tenants; providing information in multiple languages, such as announcements, documents, signage, website, and telephone system. #AirportCivilRights
Christy, @slcairport: One of the best practices we initiated with required Title VI posters was to include our names on them as contacts and ensure they are in very conspicuous places. Signs must be easy to see in places where people are. #AirportCivilRights
Christy, @slcairport: If I can look at my airport in the way that someone in my LEP plan does, I can make the airport better, not only to be in compliance but to be user friendly. #AirportCivilRights
Raymond Christy, @slcairport: As an airport operator, when we hear the government is coming to help, we panic. But we shouldn‚Äôt. When #FAA comes in for a compliance review, they are there to help us. #AirportCivilRights
We're back at the #FAA's National Civil Rights Training Conference for Airports. Up now, Cherry Smith of the FAA and Raymond Christy of @slcairport will discuss common Title VI/LEP/EJ compliance issues and best practices. #AirportCivilRights https://t.co/Iqag5fhNot

If you see something, say something: learn about and report potential DBE fraud at https://t.co/PKRKMZzc8r #AirportCivilRights
Wrongful termination of DBE or ACDBE firms is a serious non-compliance issue that may result in termination of prime contracts. #AirportCivilRights
When reviewing DBE or ACDBE performance at worksites, an #airport must ensure the scope of work is a distinct, clearly defined portion of work and that the firm is performing a commercially useful function prior to counting the participation. #AirportCivilRights
Some best practices in Compliance Monitoring include posting unlawful discrimination posters, training your staff, holding tenant meetings, and establishing complaint procedures. #AirportCivilRights
It is a best practice to take active and aggressive steps to monitor and ensure compliance for DBE &amp; ACDBE Programs. Have written processes, procedures, and templates in place to ensure this. #AirportCivilRights
Next, the #FAA Office of Civil Rights' Keturah Pristell and Thomas Knox lead an interactive discussion on best practices and strategies for implementation of Disadvantaged Business Enterprise (DBE) and Airport Concession DBE program compliance monitoring. #AirportCivilRights https://t.co/jcufQ7yeGa

Klein: Airports need policies and procedures for recognizing and addressing emotional support accommodations for the disabled. Airport staff must be made fully aware of all policies and procedures. #AirportCivilRights
Jonathan Klein, #FAA: Regarding animals in ground transportation: Rules include: 1. No automatic restriction on types of animals permitted. 2. Complementary paratransit services may require notice. 3. Animals should not obstruct aisles. #AirportCivilRights
Pierce: In airports, there are minimum requirements for numbers, sizes and locations of service animal relief areas. #AirportCivilRights
Pierce: Airlines/Airports cannot ask for documentation and someone else‚Äôs fear or allergy cannot inhibit a disabled person‚Äôs rights to have their service animal. #AirportCivilRights
Pierce: However, the threat must be based on actual evidence not just stereotypes, size or appearance. The owner of an out of control animal must be given a chance to bring their animal under control. #AirportCivilRights
Pierce: Entities must generally allow service animals, EXCEPT in the following instances: 1. Fundamental alteration 2. Direct threat 3. The animal is out of control or not house broken. #AirportCivilRights
Pierce: DOT is working to define service animals. In a recent NPRM, the public comment period received over 3000 comments. #AirportCivilRights
ACAA: Any animal that is individually trained or able to provide assistance to a qualified person with a disability; or any animal shown by documentation to be necessary for the emotional well-being of a passenger. #AirportCivilRights
DOT: Any guide dog, or other animal individually trained to do work or perform tasks for the benefit of an individual with a disability. #AirportCivilRights
DOJ: A dog that has been individually trained to do work or perform tasks for an individual with a disability that is directly related to their disability. #AirportCivilRights
ADA: A service animal is any dog that is individually trained to do work or perform tasks for the benefit of an individual with a disability, including a physical, sensory, psychiatric, intellectual, or other mental disability. #AirportCivilRights
Lori Pierce, #FAA: There are multiple federal definitions of a Service Animal: #AirportCivilRights

Preliminary: #FAA statement regarding the #GeneralAviation accident near #Miami. https://t.co/fBvb9sH9xB
Tune in today at 3:45 PM ET for live coverage of "Hot Topics - Service Animals at Airports" as part of #FAA's training conference on #AirportCivilRights.
Lipp: Access to ground #transportation is not consistent for the #disabled. We have these gaps, and we know that they're there. We need to start bridging these gaps in #accessibility by ensuring that ALL paths of travel are accessible. #AirportCivilRights
Lipp: We have to be aware of the first mile AND the last mile of a person‚Äôs journey. The bus may have AC, a bathroom and wheel chair lift, but if the person can‚Äôt get to the bus it doesn‚Äôt help. #AirportCivilRights
Lipp: Some drivers with Uber Assist have additional training to deal with special accessibility requests such as knowing how to work chairs, fixing the seats to accommodate the passenger, or even having a water bowl ready for the service animal. #AirportCivilRights
Lipp: Options for accessible transportation varies from city to city. In one airport, I‚Äôd suggest using the taxis; in other airports I‚Äôd direct you to Uber or Lyft. Does your airport know what options are available to patrons? #AirportCivilRights
Lipp: One challenge in accessible transportation is knowing who we are serving. Sometimes patrons do not self-identify ahead of time. People need to know what they can ask for. What are we doing to be ready? #AirportCivilRights
Lipp: Change is good as long as it‚Äôs for the right reasons and we think about the effects those changes have from all sides. We must consider rules that may conflict and how to work around them. How do these changes affect accessibility? #AirportCivilRights
The #FAA is enroute to the scene of a #GeneralAviation #aircraft accident near SW 8th Street in West @MiamiDadeCounty, #Florida near the #Everglades. We will issue a statement as soon as we have confirmed information.
Eric Lipp, @OpenDoorsOrg: Facilities and services must be compliant with two national laws: The Air Carrier Access Act (ACA) and The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA). These two laws do not always agree. #AirportCivilRights
Up next: Eric Lipp, @OpenDoorsOrg, will discuss #accessibility requirements for #airports and private ground #transportation providers. #AirportCivilRights https://t.co/qQHjGMaWdO

#FAA statement on @DOTInspectorGen audit of Southwest Airlines safety oversight. https://t.co/qNgYMBhZpX
Maira Algar Ruiz, @EASA: We are setting the #drone scene at the European level. We want clear and simple rules that keep the burden for citizens, operators and authorities as light as possible. #GlobalAirSafety
Rochon: We are continually making it clear to #drone operators that operating around airports, etc. is dangerous and illegal. There‚Äôs continual outreach efforts to reinforce that there are civil penalties for such illegal operations. #GlobalAirSafety
Rochon: There‚Äôs been an increase in #drone sightings since 2014, now about 100 per month. #GlobalAirSafety
Everette Rochon, #FAA: The growth of UAS is a challenge to the regulatory process. Part 107 was successful as an enabler but the regulatory process is still slower than the industry growth. Waiver process has opened door for review of higher risk operations. #GlobalAirSafety

McVenes: ‚Ä¶Now with compliance philosophy, information is sought out and reported. With the change in philosophy, we have more access to knowledge and can make better decisions. Airlines and regulators are changing rules, designs, and processes because of it. #GlobalAirSafety.
McVenes: I started my career under the enforcement philosophy. In those days, information was hidden and we didn‚Äôt know what was going on. You were punished for bringing forward information‚Ä¶ #GlobalAirSafety
Ky: We need to build on the security culture the same way we did with #safety. Whenever there is a threat, the information needs to be spread throughout the community. #GlobalAirSafety
Bahrami: With cyber security safety, the biggest concern is you don‚Äôt know where the next attack will come from. When a threat happens we need to communicate and act quickly. This highlights a need for a very robust communication system. #GlobalAirSafety
Ali Bahrami, #FAA: In terms of safety oversight in the future, we are integrating the oversight system based on SMS principles. We had to learn from SMS in order to implement a strong oversight system. #GlobalAirSafety
McVenes: In terms of thinking globally, acting locally, we can take what we learn from programs like Data 4 Safety, and apply that to other regions of the world. That‚Äôs how we can use this knowledge internationally. #GlobalAirSafety
Ky: Trust needs to be sustainable. And in order to trust something, you have to test it. To continue to see how we work is how we maintain trust. And with the new technologies, we will need to work together. #GlobalAirSafety
Yannick Malinge, @Airbus: Is safe, safe enough? Short answer is never enough. We always expect a safe #flight when we board. That‚Äôs the public expectation. A sound, robust risk management approach is key to navigating grey areas and getting it right. #GlobalAirSafety
Patrick Ky, @EASA: We don‚Äôt want to get complacent in terms of #safety. We should always be humble when we talk about safety. The most important thing is safety culture. #GlobalAirSafety
Terry McVenes, @BoeingAirplanes: In the early days we had accident data, but now we can be a little more proactive and identify things that aren‚Äôt working and improve #safety. We had to change the entire national safety culture. #GlobalAirSafety
Francis Heil, @AirlinesDotOrg: Trust culture is embedded in our safety program. As we look to the future, we‚Äôre looking at fusion and data mining of artificial intelligence to improve safety. #GlobalAirSafety
Moderator: David Silver, @AIAspeaks: It‚Äôs through robust dialogue that we have the safety record that we have. We don‚Äôt always agree but most important is that we have the tough conversations and find the answer as a community. #GlobalAirSafety
Up now, The Safest Period Ever: Maintaining Safety While Avoiding Complacency with @AIAspeaks' David Silver, #FAA's Ali Bahrami, @EASA's Patrick Ky, @BoeingAirplanes' Terry McVenes, @Airbus' Yannick Malinge, and @AirlinesDotOrg's Francis Heil. #GlobalAirSafety https://t.co/r82hH7df8I
Moderator: Shaun Johnson, Civil Aviation Authority of New Zealand: In summary, we need to collaborate and to make safety a culture, not just a target for certification. #GlobalAirSafety
Romanowski: There‚Äôve been some fundamental changes in the way #FAA does business with the evolution of #drones and #CommercialSpace. Leadership is bringing regulators and innovators to the table. There is more growth to come. #GlobalAirSafety
Allison: We‚Äôre engaging with local regulators as much as we‚Äôre engaging with federal regulators. #GlobalAirSafety
.@Transport_gc: Collaboration is key. There‚Äôs always a risk that one of us gets way ahead of the other. If we aren‚Äôt coordinated in certifying, it‚Äôs going to be complicated when we are trading products across borders. #GlobalAirSafety
Allison: The systems that we are building have to be as safe or safer than what we have now. In thinking about these innovative systems, there‚Äôs a large role for software. The role of software in certification is critically important. #GlobalAirSafety
Allison: We have to think about #safety first. #GlobalAirSafety
Allison: We‚Äôre interested in seeing aerial ride sharing at scale. We‚Äôre interested in seeing a new form of transportation that can be used everyday as a regular means of transportation. It won‚Äôt happen overnight, but we‚Äôre laying the groundwork. #GlobalAirSafety
Dr. Michael Romanowski, #FAA: The certification requirements will be tailored for the specific application, be it fixed winged, engines and propellers, etc.  #GlobalAirSafety
Eric Allison, @Uber: If we had an equivalent sandbox for commercial aviation, similar to what the military has, it could provide a great opportunity for innovation, testing and rulemaking. #GlobalAirSafety
Re: audience question on use of a sandbox testing approach: Michael Thacker, @BellFlight: A sandbox idea is good but how do you work in that space without giving away your competitive advantage? #GlobalAirSafety
Flori: No willingness to address current restrictions when a new idea arises can stifle #innovation. #GlobalAirSafety
Stephane Flori, @Airbus: The equation of success and proactive #safety: anticipation + flexibility/adaptability = lower industrial risks. #GlobalAirSafety

Liu: We have a good safety rating but we can‚Äôt rest on our laurels. Now we need a systemic approach. We are pushing the SMS more now. #GlobalAirSafety
Michael Brown, @ICAO: ICAO depends on a lot of data from our regulator and industry partners. Good sources and access to data are imperative to rulemaking and standards creation. #GlobalAirSafety
Shigeru Takano, #JCAB: Japan has a wider reporting system for safety data, especially for the airlines. We ask them to come up with a solution for the safety incident they have reported. If we see room for improvement in their process, we give them that feedback. #GlobalAirSafety
Liu: We‚Äôre looking at how we can revise rulemaking to not stifle #innovation. #GlobalAirSafety
De Vroey: We are collecting more and more data on #aircraft. It can help improve maintenance and develop new rules, but the data can also help us in reviewing our current rules. #GlobalAirSafety
Vincente De Vroey, @ASDEurope: What‚Äôs important to us is that we have a data approach to rule making. #GlobalAirSafety
#FAA‚Äôs Lirio Liu: You want to take a proactive approach and use data to push regulations, rather than have a reactive approach. #GlobalAirSafety

Sincennes: Regarding the risk of certifying UAVs within the relationships of the different authorities, we don‚Äôt have the rules in place right now. We are still working internally and with our colleagues to determine what the curve is for risk. #GlobalAirSafety
Woods: Build trust upfront so that we can avoid a crisis in the end. #GlobalAirSafety
Baker: Joint trainings and bi-lateral meetings are already happening, and that‚Äôs how the culture changes and we get that mutual confidence at the lower levels. #GlobalAirSafety
Robert Sincennes, @Transport_gc: We all agree with the destination. It‚Äôs how we get there. Our rule structure might not be built around the goal we are trying to get to. It‚Äôs a challenge but continuing conversations will get us there. #GlobalAirSafety
Baker: In the beginning of UAS, we didn‚Äôt think it would happen but we had to be open to new ideas. An evolution is occurring, you can‚Äôt wait for it to be on your door step. To be ready for the changes, we need to be involved early and work together. #GlobalAirSafety
Baker: Everyone wants to talk about unmanned #aircraft, so we‚Äôre learning about the technology together. #GlobalAirSafety

Didier Robin, @Airbus: We need to have two layers of trust for certification of a new entrant. One between the applicant and the authority, then one between the authorities such as #FAA and @EASA. #GlobalAirSafety
Baker: Going back and auditing the system validates the decision to allow the other authority to make findings on our behalf. We continue to go back and analyze - it‚Äôs a continuous evolution. We have proof that it really works. #GlobalAirSafety
Trevor Woods, @EASA: We don‚Äôt expect things to change overnight. In building trust, we need to bring up issues early so we can work on them together earlier in the process. #GlobalAirSafety
Roberto Honorato, #ANAC: Different interpretations of the rules can be a roadblock to mutual confidence in accepting a certification or validation from another authority. #GlobalAirSafety
Steve Gielisch, @TextronAviation: We work as an industry to support @EASA, the #FAA, @Transport_gc, etc. and supporting the rule making industry builds trust and supports #safety. #GlobalAirSafety.
Dorenda Baker, #FAA: To develop trust, you really need to get to know each other. Then we mature that by measuring that understanding with metrics - are we delivering on each other‚Äôs expectations. #GlobalAirSafety

RT @GAMA_Eur: Patrick Ky, @EASA Executive Director, calls for a system of systems approach to regulating and setting appropriate safety lev‚Ä¶
Pasztor: To have a diverse workforce, we need to set the tone as leadership. Setting the expectation of the culture to be open and to listen. We know that voices come forward in different ways, so we can get the benefit of these voices across the workforce. #GlobalAirSafety
Moderator, @GAMA‚Äôs Pete Bunce: I think that there is an untapped resource in the aviation industry. We are fortunate to have two successful female executives on the panel. How do you address diversity in the workforce? #GlobalAirSafety
Bahrami: With the work that Aircraft Certification is doing now in policy and certification, companies now come early in their planning. It‚Äôs forcing us to figure out how to work together and find safety solutions. #GlobalAirSafety
Swain: We‚Äôve been studying the relationships between authorities. If the choice is between working together and not, we believe it‚Äôs best to work together. #GlobalAirSafety
Pasztor: In terms of bi-lateral agreements, if you come to the table from the position of ‚ÄúI am here for the benefit of safety‚Äù then transparency increases. #GlobalAirSafety
Swain: Then we need to keep working toward the goal of harmonization. Our systems are not completely different, there should be no reason to not be harmonized from the start. #GlobalAirSafety
Swain: In order to develop new technologies and have an approach between authorities, we need to continue to work on approaches together on existing products. Getting teams together to understand the system is the first step. #GlobalAirSafety
Bahrami: To help drive cultural changes in the industry workforce, good leadership and setting expectations are important for @EASA and #FAA as well as providing opportunities for working together, more collaboration. #GlobalAirSafety
Pasztor: When I think of the engine aircraft certification group, I think about how we‚Äôre coming together. We‚Äôre working together to identify areas we need to make progress on. #GlobalAirSafety
Belinda Swain, @RollsRoyce: The relationships that are formed here and strengthened through these international partnerships help all parties achieve their goals. The relationships also help industry to work together. #GlobalAirSafety
Bahrami: We have citizens flying on different carriers all around the world. Working together is the key to #GlobalAirSafety.
Ali Bahrami, #FAA: We have matured significantly. The dialogue has changed. It‚Äôs no longer about specific issues but about how we can get better.  #GlobalAirSafety
Patrick Ky, @EASA: The aviation world is growing and the resources for authorities are getting fewer. This means we need to be smarter in how we work together.  #GlobalAirSafety
Elizabeth Pasztor, @BoeingAirplane: When thinking about what we can get out of this conference, I think about the benefits we have gained through the use of data, and then how we can apply that to our discussions here this week. #GlobalAirSafety

RT @GAManufacturers: The FAA-EASA International #AviationSafety conference has begun! Follow #GlobalAirSafety for live updates. Stay tuned‚Ä¶
Ky: Thank you very much. Enjoy the conference. #GlobalAirSafety
Ky: It takes about four years between the time we launch a rule-making activity and for it to become a rule. This is not good for #innovation. We need to shorten the regulatory process. That‚Äôs going to be one of our major changes. #GlobalAirSafety
Ky: We are changing our rule-making program to come down from 30 opinions to fewer than 10. That means we‚Äôre reducing the amount of rules, and concentrating on implementing the existing rules. #GlobalAirSafety
Ky: 2018 is a key year. Newer regulation was proposed ‚Äì EASA 2.0, so to speak ‚Äì  and is expected to enter into force later this year. #GlobalAirSafety
Patrick Ky, @EASA: The partnership between the #FAA and EASA goes far beyond the work that is seen. #GlobalAirSafety
Up next, Patrick Ky, Executive Director @EASA, will cover a few highlights from EASA‚Äôs work. #GlobalAirSafety https://t.co/5Q7FAkJlBT
Bahrami: I appreciate your dedication to work in concert with us on this very noble effort to make our global #airspace venues of prosperity, cross-cultural interchange and #innovation. Thank you. #GlobalAirSafety
Bahrami: Our long history with our #European partners, initially with individual countries and now with @EASA, has led to broad application of principles on both sides of the Atlantic. #GlobalAirSafety
Bahrami: On the global front, our recent risk-based bilateral agreements with #China and #Canada‚Äôs civil aviation authorities reflect our collective expectation the risk based validation principles will increase efficiency and timely product approvals. #GlobalAirSafety
Bahrami: Let‚Äôs talk about #drones. The #FAA continues to work on rules and policies to enable the safe integration of UAS of all types into the National Airspace. #GlobalAirSafety
Bahrami: We encourage stakeholders to self-report problems without having to fear immediate punitive action. This promotes open and honest communication that allows us, with the #aviation community, to find problems, fix them, and elevate our culture of safety. #GlobalAirSafety
Bahrami: We‚Äôre creating an environment that further enhances information sharing and encourages timely implementation of corrective actions and safety improvements is essential to the success of initiatives like CAST, Data for Safety, and ASIAS. #GlobalAirSafety
Bahrami: We applaud our #European partners with @EASA on the Data 4 Safety, D4S initiative, which complements what we are doing with ASIAS. This is another great example of joint leadership to improve global #aviation #safety. #GlobalAirSafety
Bahrami: CAST started in 1997 and in its first 10 years reduced commercial aviation fatality risk by 83 percent. We then established ASIAS in 2007 to help us further reduce the remaining risk by 50 percent by 2025. #GlobalAirSafety
Bahrami: We instituted a risk-based decision making approach within our own Safety Management System, demonstrating that we are holding ourselves accountable to the principles of an SMS as we do industry. #GlobalAirSafety
Bahrami: Last year‚Äôs introduction of the revised Certification Process Improvement Guide has resulted in greater collaboration with industry in achieving the objectives of Partnership for Safety Plans.#GlobalAirSafety
Bahrami: I would like to recognize two of our manufacturers @GEAviation and @BellFlight for receiving the #FAA Letter of Acceptance for their Safety Management Systems. These companies voluntarily complied with the SMS standards. #GlobalAirSafety
Bahrami: This past March, we successfully achieved a significant milestone on our journey toward the Safety Management System way of managing risk. From this point forward, all new air carriers must have an SMS in place before they can begin operations. #GlobalAirSafety
Bahrami: We reorganized our Flight Standards to better serve our stakeholders: Air Carrier Safety Assurance, General Aviation Safety Assurance, Safety Standards and Foundational Business. #GlobalAirSafety
Bahrami: The #FAA has made a commitment to raise the bar on #safety. Through our emphasis on enhanced communications, collaboration and consistency, we've made significant progress toward our primary objective in #CommercialAviation and #GA. #GlobalAirSafety
Bahrami: We must seek to be more nimble, resourceful, and forward-looking in safely accommodating all our #airspace users. We need to find ways to rely on risk based approaches to certification and oversight, and leverage international partnerships. #GlobalAirSafety
Bahrami: Throughout the United States, we are seeing more and more air transportation and #cargo traffic, #drone activities and #space launches. #GlobalAirSafety
Bahrami: Our #NationalAirspaceSystem is also seeing increased #space launch activity. This region boasts an active #spaceport at Wallops Island #Virginia, some 172 miles southeast of Washington, D.C. #GlobalAirSafety
Bahrami: Out at @NASA_Langley, engineers are working on the next generation of low noise, low emissions supersonic #aircraft, which we will incorporate into the national airspace as well. #GlobalAirSafety
Bahrami: And in Herndon, #Virginia, the Virginia Innovation and Entrepreneurship Investment Authority is one of 10 participants in the #FAA‚Äôs new #DronePilot Program. #GlobalAirSafety
Bahrami: Near here, in Blacksburg, #Virginia, the UAS Test Site at @virginia_tech, is testing rural and urban package delivery using #drone-supporting technologies like detection and avoidance, identification, and tracking and mapping systems. #GlobalAirSafety
Bahrami: We also have extensive military #aviation operations in the area, including fixed wing and rotor wing flights from @NASPaxRiverPAO and nearby @Andrews_JBA home of #AirForceOne. #GlobalAirSafety
Bahrami: Every day, our major international #airports see roughly 220,000 passengers. These flights, along with local #GA traffic and #drones, must not only obey normal #FAA #safety restrictions, they must also stay clear of the Air Defense Identification Zone. #GlobalAirSafety
Bahrami: I want to paint a picture for you of our safety challenge, based on the complexity of air traffic management here in D.C., which presents a microcosm of dynamic changes occurring in our nation‚Äôs #airspace, the world‚Äôs largest #AirTraffic system.  #GlobalAirSafety
Ali Bahrami, #FAA: Welcome to the International Aviation Safety Conference. While each of you may represent different segments of the industry, we share an uncompromising dedication to #aviation safety. #GlobalAirSafety
Up next, opening remarks from #FAA‚Äôs Ali Bahrami. #GlobalAirSafety https://t.co/xs0nP1p5IP
Elwell: We‚Äôre a global community. And there‚Äôs no limit to what we can achieve when we work together. Thank you again for joining us this week. I‚Äôm looking forward to a productive conference. #GlobalAirSafety
Elwell: The US is a worldwide leader in #aviation. And the Trump Administration intends to keep it. But we know we don't have a monopoly on good ideas. We need our partners in the international #aviation community to help us reach the next level of safety. #GlobalAirSafety
Elwell: #Brexit is going to affect passengers, businesses, and the entire global supply chain. But early planning can help mitigate those impacts. So it's in everyone‚Äôs best interest to reach a decision on the #aviation components of Brexit as soon as possible. #GlobalAirSafety
Elwell: #Brexit and its March 2019 deadline is obviously on all of our minds. And as the clock runs down, removing uncertainty about the #UK and its #aviation agreements with the rest of the world only becomes more important. #GlobalAirSafety
Elwell: The #FAA and the @transport_EU amended their Safety Agreement this morning, and took the first step toward lowering validation fees for manufacturers. #GlobalAirSafety
Elwell: The US signed a revised Memorandum of Cooperation with the EU late last year. It expanded our collaboration on air traffic #modernization to include deployment activities. This will support continued seamless transatlantic operations. #GlobalAirSafety
Elwell: We‚Äôre about 18 months away from a deadline that will require all #aircraft flying within controlled airspace to be equipped with #ADSB. #Equip2020 #GlobalAirSafety
Elwell: In FAA facilities around the country, state-of-the-art computers are supporting new automation systems that make managing air traffic more efficient. #DataComm #Modernization #GlobalAirSafety
Elwell: Integrating new users into a system that already includes everything from jumbo jets to hot air balloons goes hand-in-hand with investing in modern #AirTraffic systems that can manage it all. #GlobalAirSafety
Elwell: We‚Äôre also changing our approach to #CommercialSpace launches. We‚Äôre looking at how #newtechnologies like the Space Data Integrator can make launches less disruptive to nearby airspace users. #GlobalAirSafety
Elwell: I joined @USDOT Secretary Chao last month to announce ten #DronePilot program sites across the country where state, local, and tribal governments will be working with private industry to demonstrate and study expanded #drone operations. #GlobalAirSafety
Elwell: This is where we can learn so much from each other. #Drones and #CommercialSpace operations have captured the world‚Äôs imagination. We were the first country to integrate commercial drone operations under specific conditions into complex airspace. #GlobalAirSafety
Elwell: Finding answers to all of our #safety questions starts with how we integrate new users into our #airspace. #GlobalAirSafety
Elwell: We don‚Äôt compete on safety. Conferences like this give us the opportunity to reaffirm that commitment. And it‚Äôs especially important to do so now. #GlobalAirSafety
#FAA Acting Administrator Dan Elwell: It‚Äôs great to see so many of our international counterparts this week ‚Äì not only from Europe, but from around the world. #GlobalAirSafety

Burleson: By removing regulatory burdens, using technology, and partnering closely with industry, we‚Äôll ensure our nation continues building on its great legacy as a worldwide aerospace leader. #COMSTAC
Burleson: The future of commercial space transportation is bright and it‚Äôs still being written. The Trump Administration is committed to making sure it‚Äôs written right here, in the United States. #COMSTAC
Burleson: After lagging behind China and Russia for years, the United States licensed the most #CommercialSpace launches in the world in 2017. We‚Äôre on track to beat that record in 2018. #COMSTAC
Burleson: A recent study estimated that the 2017 #CommercialSpace market was worth almost $9 billion. In only 7 years, that figure is expected to triple to more than $27 billion. Space transportation won‚Äôt just create new jobs, it will create entirely new industries.

Did you miss the #FAAAirportGrants18 announcement today with @USDOT Secretary Chao and #FAA Acting Administrator Dan Elwell? Watch the video and see how we are improving airports across the country. https://t.co/FcqZZoxJU8
BREAKING: @USDOT announces $677 million in infrastructure grants to 214 #airports in 43 states.  These projects are important to the #safety and efficiency of the nation‚Äôs airports. https://t.co/ene5zoDKFk #FAAAirportGrants18 https://t.co/xgrHTvLr4R
#FAA Dan Elwell: And thanks to @POTUS and Secretary Chao‚Äôs leadership, the nation‚Äôs airports can and will be our crown jewel. #FAAAirportGrants18
#FAA Dan Elwell: And we‚Äôre working closely with Congress to ensure that the #FAA has the resources it needs to continue delivering the level of service the American people expect. #FAAAirportGrants18
#FAA Dan Elwell: America‚Äôs airways are just as important as its highways. So we‚Äôre going to continue partnering with industry to prioritize our #air traffic control modernization efforts. #FAAAirportGrants18
#FAA Dan Elwell: That‚Äôs an example of one of our larger AIP grants. But we‚Äôre also supporting smaller projects, with significant benefits. Rockford, Illinois is receiving $3.1 million to expand a cargo apron at @FlyRFD.  #FAAAirportGrants18
#FAA, Dan Elwell: In Alaska, $12.8 million in AIP grants will be used to rehabilitate a runway and taxiway at King Salmon Airport. With limited road infrastructure, the #airport is one of the only ways to move people and goods in and out of King Salmon. #FAAAirportGrants18
#FAA, Acting Administrator Dan Elwell: Today‚Äôs announcement of $677 million for 346 projects nationwide is just the tip of the iceberg. We‚Äôll be awarding almost $3.2 billion in AIP grant funding this year. #FAAAirportGrants18
#FAA Acting Administrator, Dan Elwell: We can all agree - a first class nation needs first class airports. And the Airport Improvement Program is one of our primary means of getting there. #FAAAirportGrants18
.@USDOT, Secretary Chao: Today, the Department will announce $677 million in 241 grants for 346 projects. Overall, this will benefit 214 airports in 43 states. #FAAAirportGrants18
.@USDOT,Secretary Chao: Increased air access can generate new opportunities even in relatively remote communities, so the AIP grants target many small rural airports. #FAAAirportGrants18
.@USDOT, Secretary Chao: This infrastructure supports an industry that generates $1.6 Trillion in economic activity and supports nearly 11 million jobs. #FAAAirportGrants18
.@USDOT, Secretary Chao: The department also has significant news to share about #AIP grants. Our country‚Äôs #aviation infrastructure includes 3,332 airports and 5,000 paved runways. #FAAAirportGrants18
.@USDOT, Secretary Chao: Fewer delays, faster movement of people and freight, #economic growth, improved #international competitiveness, and, especially, more jobs and opportunities. That is why this Administration has made infrastructure a high priority. #FAAAirportGrants18
.@USDOT, Secretary Chao: When you build better transportation #infrastructure, you build a better quality of life. #FAAAirportGrants18

Visiting the @SunnFunFlyIn this week in #Lakeland, #Florida? Stop by the #FAA Safety Center. We have experts available to answer your questions about #ADSB, weather, medical and airman certification, Basic Med, and runway safety. #SNF18 #FlySafe https://t.co/2McH55jpH4
If you have more #ADSB questions for our panel, visit us at the #FAA Safety Center at #SNF18. #Equip2020 https://t.co/lBzffTru5x
Marks: Overlay maps on https://t.co/CBR9TdJoxA are helpful in seeing areas of radar coverage vs #ADSB coverage. #SNF18 #Equip2020
Marks: There are no maintenance check requirements in the mandate because we have a performance monitor that continuously tells us whether your equipment is working properly. #SNF18 #Equip2020
Marks: Eventually you have to replace your old car with a new one, and that's where we're at with #ADSB. We're modernizing our #airspace. #SNF18 #Equip2020
Jens Hennig, @GAManufacturers: Some questions to ask are - what kind of transponder do you have? Do you want to keep it? What kind of GPS equipment do you have? What do you want to do with #ADSB? Do you want to be just rule compliant, or get ADS-B In? #SNF18 #Equip2020
Marks: Everything is in place, so there's no reason to expect the mandate to slip. #SNF18 #Equip2020
James Marks, #FAA: The #ADSB #Equip2020 deadline won't change. We're ready to flip the switch on January 1, 2020. We're waiting for you. #SNF18
Up next, #ADSB Equipage Countdown with Jens Hennig of @GAManufacturers, James Marks and Jamal Wilson of the #FAA and Melissa Rudinger of @AOPA. #SNF18 #Equip2020 https://t.co/pRNm1GK0Xu
Ranasingha: If you book today, our shop can get you in for #ADSB installation, at the earliest, August, and we're 20 months away from the deadline. Everybody needs to equip and everybody needs to equip now. #SNF18 #Equip2020
@RDUAirport @RDUCEO Thank you, @RDUAirport!
Ranasingha: Portable #ADSB transmitters are specifically banned by the #FAA mandate. #SNF18 #Equip2020
Ranasingha: In order to be #ADSB compliant, you need an ADS-B approved position source and an ADS-B approved transmitter that has been approved as a pair. #SNF18 #Equip2020
Ranasingha: To equip approx. 100,000 #airplanes in 20 months, that averages to 8 installation jobs a month. But other things are going on in our shops, too. #SNF18 #Equip2020
Ranasingha: When do I need #ADSB? January 1, 2020. That's just over 20 months. https://t.co/9t9slMF0Ff #SNF18 #Equip2020
Ranasingha: Who needs #ADSB? ADS-B is an operational requirement in rule airspace. #SNF18 #Equip2020
Pahan Ranasingha, Avionics Installations: Why do we need #ADSB? It enhances #safety and efficiency and reduces the risk of runway incursions, among other benefits. #SNF18, #Equip2020

Palmer: The #FAA is helping with #rotocraft #safety by supporting @HAI_Helicopters's "Best Practices," "Rotocraft Safety Challenge," and by disseminating their presentations. #SNF18 #FlySafe
Palmer: #BasicMed reduces the burden of obtaining airman medical certification but the #pilot has to take online training course which enhances knowledge in this area. #SNF18 #FlySafe
Palmer: I've been a #flight instructor. Why are we having flight instruction fatalities? We can't fix this problem alone. #FlySafe #SNF18
Palmer: We‚Äôre working with the GA community to gather data. We have data from over 17k safety reports and over 700k hrs of flight from the National GA Flight Information Databases. #SNF18 #FlySafe
Palmer: The GAJSC has recently turned its attention to power plant system component failures and is working on #safety enhancements to support that effort. #FlySafe #SNF18
Palmer: The collaborative approach combines the expertise of many key decision makers, and involves different parts of the #FAA, several government agencies, and stakeholder groups. https://t.co/38815oTiCL #SNF18 #FlySafe
Palmer: The government and industry collaboration of the GAJSC has produced #safety enhancements that are making a difference. #FlySafe #SNF18
Palmer: Building off the success of the Commercial Aviation Safety Team (CAST), the General Aviation Joint Steering Committee (GAJSC) was formed. https://t.co/38815oTiCL #SNF #FlySafe
Palmer: The GA Steering Committee is working on reducing fatalities. Loss of Control is the leading cause of accidents. The group is strategically targeting government and industry resources. https://t.co/38815oTiCL  #FlySafe #SNF18
Palmer: Our regulatory philosophy is finding ways to get to yes! #SNF18 #FlySafe
Palmer: The #FAA's regulatory philosophy takes into account the size, importance and history of the #GeneralAviation community, which offers lessons the FAA takes seriously. #SNF18, #FlySafe
Palmer: The @GeneralAviation community is critical to our country. There are more than 600,000 active #pilots. An estimated 65% of flights are conducted for business or public service. #FlySafe #SNF18
Brad Palmer, #FAA: We can't do anything without partnering with the #aviation industry. There are lots of engagement opportunities out there. We can't be successful in aviation #safety without you. #FlySafe #SNF18
