@realDonaldTrump For once Trump is right. The notion of an independent judiciary is a farce . Presidents from particular philosophical backgrounds pick these judges and therefore their philosophy and their particular leaning will be obvious. The latest SC fight made this abundantly clear.
@CNN A woman was raped by this nominee Sen Graham.  She knows who raped her and it was judge Kavanaugh.  to tell the world that it wasn't is saying that Dr. Ford is lying.  Dr Ford remembers who raped her.  Whose being unethical?  Thankfully Sen Flake stood up for what's right.
@FoxNewsSunday @LindseyGrahamSC you are being used by Trump ever since you have come under that devils spell.  then you invoke that devil's name at the funeral of your supposed friend John McCain.  If I were the McCain family I would have been extremely hurt and betrayed by you.
@LindseyGrahamSC why have you sold your soul to a devil that you couldn't bring yourself to vote for.  I use to think a great deal of you, but since you have decided to support a bad man, you have proven to the world that you are no better than Trump. Extremely disppointing.
Tonight I am disgusted by Trump and what he thinks Kavanaugh's accuser Professor Frost should have done after being raped by Kavanaugh.  Trump says that he should have called the FBI if "it was really that bad."
@realDonaldTrump What a terrible use of this power.  Bill Clinton did this as well with Ritchie.  Libby was another one that Trump should not have pardoned.  If a Rep. does a crime, they don't do the time?  This sets a horrible precedence.  Well, the precedence has been set, but still...
@FLOTUS @WhiteHouse "Help me!!!! Help me!!! Donald has me tied up in the basement."
@THEsaragilbert Donald Trump has created a culture of evil and so his followers like RB spew evil.  American is definitely not great again.  We must stand up against this kind of filth and say we aren't going to stand for bigotry!!!
@NY23rd I have heard online so many of our marvelous forums and debates.  I am proud that WE DEMS do not get down in the mud with one another.  Soon when our nominee is chosen we will rally around him or her to fight for decency and compassion in Washington.
He has so little respect for blacks why would he take the time on this MLK day to pay tribute to a man who fought for black civil rights? https://t.co/kSwbtEde8r
Why did some Republicans have to lie for the President about his "shithole" remarks while other Republicans said he did QUIETLY?  On this MLK day I would hope that members of the President's own party would have intestinal fortitude to stand up to their biggoted leader.
@kylegriffin1 sorry, my brother should have watched bit first.  my bad!!

I learned that SC decisions can do more harm than good to a cause. Let the states experiment on their own for awhile with same-sex-marriage.
SCJs wonder whether or not it's too soon to rule on gay marriage! It's a little late for that!  It is never to soon to undo an injustice!
Are our religious freedoms being undermined by Right who want to ban all abortions and gay marriage?  It feels like it to me.
The only justification for banning same sex marriage is a religious one.  Case of religious freedom for those who aren't religious?
even conservative justices today on SC are mocking opponents of same sex marriage.  55 year old can still get married fertile or infertile
Can or should laws be crafted to ban people from marrying the person of their choice?  It seems a simple question of equal protection.

4 years ago we were in Iraq. Today we out of Iraq, Osama is dead, and we are gearing up to get out of Afganastan. We are better off!!!!!!

It's only a tax if you don't buy health insurance.  If you do and you can't afford it, it will be the BIGGEST tax cut of your life
I gave up my soul-mate for this decision.  Long story.  Ezra, it was bloody awful.  3 months thinking my young adult life-time was a waste
Did you and your family lie when you ransacked the RNC wearing the best of everything and anything during the 2008 Presidential Campaign?

This health care law definitely does not impede hiring.
