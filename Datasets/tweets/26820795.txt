@Vargulfen @katynell @CBKimbrell @GoddessofGrain @BeefCheckoff @Beef @SBakerMD Might not be possible for us to replicate the muscles of @SBakerMD üòî But in all seriousness open to suggestions for how to best reach audiences outside of the ag ‚Äúbubble‚Äù  - what would you suggest?
@Vargulfen @katynell @CBKimbrell @GoddessofGrain @BeefCheckoff @Beef @SBakerMD Many in the scientific community think EAT Lancet is trash. The authors are the same cast of characters who have been anti-meat for years. They have no credibility. https://t.co/O7CA8YMEeB
@roesch_scott @cowbroker @MarkNel1026 @katynell @CBKimbrell @GoddessofGrain @BeefCheckoff @Beef Hear the frustration, but some stats for consideration: Over 13 million views on the BIWFD website. Quoted in major news outlets on EAT Lancet coverage (headlines did suck, though). And this website to push back on sustainability attacks - https://t.co/m3DWa6S0sU
@roesch_scott @cowbroker @MarkNel1026 @katynell @CBKimbrell @GoddessofGrain @BeefCheckoff @Beef There‚Äôs absolutely a need to fight. Never meant to imply otherwise. Shots are fired at radical activists all the time, esp. in the policy arena. Agree on need to improve reach to everyday consumers.
@jsreinecker @Vines_N_Cattle We have a policy not to slide into DMs this late in the evening. But definitely open to further convos/ideas
@jsreinecker @Vines_N_Cattle How would one get in touch with ‚Äúyour people?‚Äù üòÇ
@CBKimbrell @GoddessofGrain @katynell @BeefCheckoff @CoryBooker Everyone who cares about the cattle industry takes the issue seriously, including NCBA. Agree we all can do better. 		Just encouraging everyone to keep some perspective and not get dismayed by the 24 hour news cycle, which favors negativity over positivity.
@GoddessofGrain @katynell @CBKimbrell @BeefCheckoff Negative press can be discouraging, but its important to remember that (1) radical proposals tend to attract media attention, even if they aren't going anywhere and (2) for every @CoryBooker there are others in Congress who stand up for the cattle industry.
@GoddessofGrain @katynell @CBKimbrell @BeefCheckoff .@Beef is doing a lot to promote the positive attributes of #beef. When it comes to lobbying, that's what the NCBA Gov't Affairs team in DC does everyday (paid for by membership dues). The NCBA-PAC is also a valuable tool for supporting lawmakers who support cattle producers.

@seedcattleguy @BeefUSA Have you ever participated in the NCBA policy process or spoken with a producer who has? Have you ever asked the staff of the NCBA affiliate in your state what the national policy process is like? If not, you should. Producers control the policy direction of NCBA. Full stop.
@seedcattleguy @BeefUSA Happy to clarify. It seems pretty well-known. Unfortunately a small minority of producers push a false narrative about the packers setting policy priorities for NCBA, when it‚Äôs our affiliates and producer-members who set our policy.
FW: @AOC. Great job, @drsplace! https://t.co/rKjzdHahlT
Tune in to see @SecretarySonny... https://t.co/VbkRI6KGrF
@seedcattleguy @BeefUSA Better yet, come to Convention next year and see how the process works for yourself! Each policy committee hears resolutions proposed by state affiliates, debates them, then votes on them. It's not sexy, but it's how policy work gets done.
@seedcattleguy @BeefUSA The fact is that our policy is developed and approved by our state affiliates and producer-members. See exhibit A on #FakeMeat. There is simply no way reps from packer/processors could out-vote producers. 	Read about our policy process here: https://t.co/8qjEwkgVkp https://t.co/HnEagOjtbl
@seedcattleguy @BeefUSA Tyson and Cargill are part of the NCBA Product Council. They do have seats on the NCBA Board of Directors which gives them a vote on NCBA policy, but overall packer representation is very small (8 out of 239 seats). State affiliates have the dominant voice with nearly 200 seats.
@MarkNel1026 @seedcattleguy @USMEF @USDA Latest 2018 USDA beef cattle inventory estimated 31.7 M hd in the U.S. Imported cattle thru Nov. of 2018 was just over 1.7 M hd (and those numbers don't even differentiate bt beef and dairy cattle). That works out to about 5% of the U.S. herd.
@MarkNel1026 @seedcattleguy @USMEF @USDA Every segment benefits from exports, not just packers. Most economists would agree. Understand you do not. 		Referenced cattle import stats are from USDA (segmented by weight). Available here: https://t.co/tE9GIOHv5L. Imported cattle are a small fraction of the overall U.S. herd. https://t.co/tfpmGBd8LP
@seedcattleguy @MarkNel1026 @USMEF @USDA Imports are a fraction of the U.S. cow herd (between 2-5% of total). 2018 imports thru Nov. = 1.7 M hd, in line w/ yearly avg. of about 2 M hd. Worth noting that many U.S. producers (stockers, feeders) make money by providing care for imported cattle.
@seedcattleguy @MarkNel1026 The export numbers cited are compiled by @USMEF using @USDA data. U.S. beef exports help increase demand for cattle from U.S. producers (a good thing!). Most would agree that helps U.S. producers but understand if you feel differently.

This week's @BeltwayBeef podcast comes to you from the big ol' #FakeMeat hearing in DC - hear from NCBA's Kevin Kester, Jennifer Houston and Danielle Beck from @USDA HQ... https://t.co/D6D0H2EOiD
"NCBA firmly believes the term 'beef' should only apply to products derived from actual livestock...USDA can be trusted to ensure fair and accurate product labels for lab-grown fake meat." - NCBA President Kevin Kester https://t.co/91eK0dseiA
The @US_FDA turned a blind eye to mislabled milk products for decades. @USDA's labeling process is the best way to accurately inform consumers and protect beef's brand. https://t.co/9TDAuDZQ75
#FakeMeatFact: "[Lab-grown fake meat products] will not be sterile. The environment where they are grown is very conducive to the growth of pathogens." - Barbara Kowalcyk, Assistant Professor, Department of Food Science and Technology, The Ohio State University
.@USDA official says they would ensure lab-grown fake meat labels are not "false or misleading" and give consumers "enough information to make an informed decision"		That's exactly why we are fighting for @USDA oversight! https://t.co/TPRyh7XvEU

@groves_chase Good q. The answer doesn't fit neatly into a soundbite!
@groves_chase 2/2: What matters to consumers is the label. That is what they will see at the grocery store. Under FDA oversight, companies will label their product whatever they want with little fear of enforcement. USDA ensures fair and accurate labels.
@groves_chase 1/2: USDA regulates meat, meat food products, and meat byproducts. All these have separate definitions in federal law. Just because a product is regulated by USDA does not make it meat.

@chasepurdy Umm‚Ä¶imitation beef grown in a petri dish is most definitely #FakeMeat. Didn‚Äôt mean to give you the wrong impression. USDA should regulate lab-grown fake meat with the same scrutiny as real beef to protect consumers.

@MarkNel1026 @BeefUSA FDA's two-decade-long track record of inaction on fake milk suggests you're overly optimistic about how aggressively they'll police fake meat.
@MarkNel1026 @BeefUSA The first time dairy reached out to FDA re: fake milk was Feb 2000. 18 years later, these products are still allowed to call themselves "milk." The term ‚Äúclean meat‚Äù is a guarantee with FDA regulation, even if there is a Standard of Identity for beef.
@MarkNel1026 @BeefUSA That doesn't mean they should be allowed to market themselves as real meat. We specifically say they shouldn't. But if they try to claim that their lab-developed product is a type of meat, then they should be regulated that way.
@Brookemillermd @GranerKenny @USDA The answer is absolutely not. USDA regulation of lab-grown products is the best way to ensure that they have to be labeled fairly and accurately. Petition 18-01 may be well-intended, but it won‚Äôt provide producers the protection we need.
