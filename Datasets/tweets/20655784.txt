@Nianio_ @nytopinion @nytimes To be clear, I believe the U.S. wants to help force regime change to open up Venezuela oil reserves to U.S. corporations. Do you disagree?

@Nianio_ @nytopinion @nytimes I‚Äôm curious... Do you believe the U.S. was sincerely trying to send in humanitarian aid? Or do you think it was a political stunt by the U.S. to make Maduro look even worse?
@nytopinion This @nytimes article is regime-change propaganda. Here‚Äôs what humanitarian agencies thought of the U.S aid stunt:  ‚Äúthe International Committee of the Red Cross, United Nations agencies and other relief organizations have refused to collaborate with the U.S. and its allies‚Äù-@npr
