When a helicopter enters a hover, it is using all of its power to provide lift, while a fixed wing aircraft can enter a holding pattern with still only enough power to offset the drag.
Two-seater and four-seater aeroplane flying at 250 km/h with old generation engines can burn 25 to 40 liters per flight hour, 3 to 5 liters per 100 passenger km. The Sikorsky S-76C++ twin turbine helicopter gets about 143 liter per 100 km; 260 km/h; 160 mph.
When helicopters are traveling slow, they need more energy to hold their weight. When traveling fast (according to their standards), the rotor drag is very high. This is the primary reason they need more power. More Power = More Fuel.

Shia believes that only those descended directly from Prophet Muhammad, family members can be the succesor, the Caliph / Khalifah of Islam. The Sunni meanwhile believes that the Caliph / Khalifah of Islam can only be chosen for their organizational talent, not their bloodline.
All religions attract conflicts as well as stability, there is always room for differing opinions an Islam is no different. The big split in Islam is between Sunni and Shiite / Shia. In Christianity, it is between Methodist and Catholic.

The marketing mix is a foundation model . The marketing mix has been defined as the "set of marketing tools that the firm uses to pursue its marketing objectives in the target". The marketing mix refers to 4 broad levels of marketing decision, product, price, promotion, place.
Pricing is one of the most vital and highly demanded component within the theory of marketing mix. It helps consumers to have an image of the standards the firm has to offer through their products, creating firms to have an exceptional reputation in the market.

The total number of languages natively spoken in Africa is variously estimated (depending on the delineation of language vs. dialect) at between 1,250 and 2,100, and by some counts at "over 3,000". Nigeria alone has over 500 languages.
The ethnic groups of Africa number in the thousands, with each population generally having its own language (or dialect of a language) and culture. The ethnolinguistic groups include various Afroasiatic, Khoisan, Niger-Congo and Nilo-Saharan populations.
The Atlantic slave trade or transatlantic slave trade involved the transportation by slave traders of enslaved African people, mainly to the Americas. The slave trade regularly used the triangular trade route and its Middle Passage, existed from the 16th to the 19th centuries.

Armenian red has been the dye by excellence, in the renaissance painting, it is the royal colour for Isabella of Portugal and most of other queens. Vordan Garmir as valuable as gold, most precious textiles, even for the Christ child, for saints.
The Armenian cochineal (porphyrophora hamelii) also known as the Ararat cochineal was formerly used to produce an eponymous crimson carmine dyestuff known in Armenia as Vordan Garmir.

The word metamorphosis derives from Greek μεταμόρφωσις, "transformation, transforming", from μετα- (meta-), "after" and μορφή (morphe), "form".
Hemimetabolism or hemimetaboly, also called incomplete metamorphosis and paurometabolism, is the mode of development of certain insects that includes three distinct stages: the egg, nymph, and the adult stage, or imago.
Hemiptera is the largest order of hemimetabolous insects (not undergoing complete metamorphosis; though some examples such as male scale insects do undergo a form of complete metamorphosis) containing over 75,000 named species.
The scale insects are small insects of the order Hemiptera, suborder Sternorrhyncha. They comprise the superfamily Coccoidea, previously placed in the now obsolete group called "Homoptera". There are about 8,000 described species of scale insects.
The cochineal is a scale insect in the suborder Sternorrhyncha, from which the natural dye carmine is derived. A primarily sessile parasite native to tropical and subtropical South America through North America (Mexico and the Southwest United States).

The designations "developed" and "developing" are intended for statistical convenience and do not necessarily express a judgement about the stage reached by a particular country or area in the development process
Dependency theory is the notion that resources flow from a "periphery" of poor and underdeveloped states to a "core" of wealthy states, enriching the latter at the expense of the former.
In order to count a good or service, it is necessary to assign value to it. The value that the measures of national income and output assign to a good or service is its market value – the price it fetches when bought or sold.
Output in economics is the "quantity of goods or services produced in a given time period, by a firm, industry, or country", whether consumed or used for further production.
Production is a process of combining various material inputs and immaterial inputs (plans, know-how) in order to make something for consumption (the output). It is the act of creating an output, a good or service which has value and contributes to the utility of individuals.

Within economics the concept of utility is used to model worth or value, but its usage has evolved significantly over time.
In economics, a durable good or a hard good is a good that does not quickly wear out, or more specifically, one that yields utility over time rather than being completely consumed in one use.
The age of high mass consumption refers to the period of contemporary comfort afforded many western nations, wherein consumers concentrate on durable goods, and hardly remember the subsistence concerns of previous stages.
After take-off, there follows a long interval of sustained growth known as the stage of drive to maturity. Rostow defines it "as the period when a society has effectively applied the range of modern technology to the bulk of its resources."

The supermarket method evolved into the Kanban System with the addition of a production instruction sheet known as the Kanban (card or board indicating the product name, product number, and quantity). The system further developed into the Just-in-Time system.
The supermarket method was introduced based on hints obtained from a report on a Lockheed aircraft plant in the United States in an industry publication in the spring of 1954, by using the supermarket method to assemble jet bombers, expenses were reduced by $250,000 annually.

The term “due diligence” means "required carefulness" or "reasonable care" in general usage, and has been used in this sense since at least the mid-fifteenth century.
RT @parkerclewis: Youtube is Pixelon come true.
Con artists make money through deception. They lie, cheat, fool people into thinking they've happened onto a great deal or some easy money, when they're the ones who'll be making money. Conman means 'confidence man', Samuel Thompson (1821–1856) was the original "confidence man".
The word phoneme comes from the Greek: φώνημα, phōnēma, meaning "that which is sounded", from the verb φωνέω, phōneō, "sound", which comes in turn from the noun φωνή, phōnē, "sound". Thus it was originally used (in its French form phonème) to refer simply to a speech sound.
The word grapheme, coined in analogy with phoneme, is derived from Ancient Greek γράφω (gráphō), meaning 'write', and the suffix -eme, by analogy with phoneme and other names of emic units. The study of graphemes is called graphemics.
The term word may refer to a spoken word or to a written word, or sometimes to the abstract concept behind either. Spoken words are made up of units of sound called phonemes, and written words of symbols called graphemes, such as the letters of the English alphabet.
A morpheme is the smallest grammatical unit in a language. A morpheme is not identical to a word, and the principal difference between the two is that a morpheme may or may not stand alone, whereas a word, by definition, is freestanding.
In linguistics, a blend word or a blend is a word formed from parts of two or more other words. These parts are sometimes, but not always, morphemes.
A portmanteau or portmanteau word is a linguistic blend of words, in which parts of multiple words or their phones (sounds) are combined into a new word, as in smog, coined by blending smoke and fog, or motel, from motor and hotel.
A codec is a device or computer program for encoding or decoding a digital data stream or signal. Codec is a portmanteau of coder-decoder.
Diplomatic history can be different from international relations in that the former can concern itself with the foreign policy of one state while the latter deals with relations between two or more states.
World history or global history (not to be confused with diplomatic, transnational or international history) is a field of historical study that emerged as a distinct academic field in the 1980s. It examines history from a global perspective.
The Zeitgeist ( German pronunciation /ˈtsaɪtɡaɪst/ ) is a concept from 18th- to 19th-century German philosophy, translated as "spirit of the age" or "spirit of the times". It refers to an invisible agent or force dominating the characteristics of a given epoch in world history.
Making a start-up sustainable is not easy. So it's obviously very important for the founder to keep his or her eye on the ball, on the big vision at all times but at the same time to surround themselves with leaders, even if it is one other leader who can tap into the Zeitgeist.

The way to be more productive, more inspired, more joyful life is to get enough sleep.
Getting enough sleep means get enough 8 hours sleep. Turn off all the social medias, turn off all the notifications, every notification is an interruption, it will interrupt the productivity. Take a warm bath or shower before go to sleep, read some good book.
Sleep is necessary. Turn off all the device, throw it out of the bedroom. Better night sleep will make you much more productive for the next day.

The producers will produce those goods which offer them high profits. The producers will always use that technology which will maximise efficiency and minimise cost, thereby resulting in maximum profit. In market economy, the producers will produce goods for people afford to pay.
A market economy is an economic system in which the decisions regarding investment, production, and distribution are guided by the price signals created by the forces of supply and demand.
A market is one of the many varieties of systems, institutions, procedures, social relations and infrastructures whereby parties engage in exchange.
Market share is the percentage of a market (defined in terms of either units or revenue) accounted for by a specific entity.

Startups were throwing $100,000 parties before they'd even earned a cent. You put a dot-com on anything and its value went up in the minds of people or you looked cooler or you seemed more important, and so businesses were putting dot-coms on the cover of magazines.
A fatal system error, also known as a system crash, stop error, kernel error, or bug check, occurs when an operating system halts, because it has reached a condition where it can no longer operate safely.
In computing, a fatal exception error or fatal error is an error that causes a program to abort and may therefore return the user to the operating system. When this happens, data that the program was processing may be lost.
RT @SavMThompson: Fatal Error coming for your faves https://t.co/skfVC2EQHH
It can be presented in a variety of ways and the really irritating thing is when it happens arbitrarily and not consistently  because it make it rally hard to fix.

For isn't by size that you win or you fail, be the best of whatever you are. Finally in your life's blueprint, must be a commitment to the eternal principals of beauty, love, and justice, we must keep moving, we must keep going.
As the days and the years unfold, what you will do in life, what your life's work will be. Once you discover what it will be, set out to do it, and to do it well. Be a bush if you can't be a tree. If you can't be a highway, just be a trail. If you can't be the sun, be a star.
Always feel that you count. Always feel that you have worth, and always feel that your life has ultimate significance. Secondly, in your life's blueprint, you must have as basic principle the determination to achieve excellence in your various fields of endeavor.
Number one in your life's blueprint should be a deep belief in your own dignity, your own worth, and your own somebodiness. Don't allow anybody to make you feel that you are nobody.
In design, you have to make sense. It is an art to solve problems. It's an opportunity to make difference in people's life.

Praefectus urbi, for example, were appointed officials who ran Rome in the absence of consuls, enforced the laws, and heard some court cases.
The Roman Assemblies included all free male Roman citizens. They voted on major issues but the rich patricians had more votes than the poor plebeians, or commoners. Assemblymen elected tribunes to the Senate, who were supposed to speak for the poor.
In Roman Republic, the consuls wielded the all executive power and controlled the army. Second, there were the senators; they held their posts for life. Roman senators were men from wealthy families who advised the consuls. Initially the Roman Senate had about 300 members.
The Roman Republic inspired and informed the American Founders' own thinking about government. The lessons they learned from the Roman Republic helped them create the U.S. Constitutions, with its separation of powers, checks and balances, and other structures designed.
Historiography was more recently defined as "When you study 'historiography' you do not study the events of the past directly, but the changing interpretations of those events in the works of individual historians."
In historiography, ancient Rome is Roman civilization from the founding of city of Rome in the 8th century BC to the collapse of the Western Roman Empire in the 5th century AD, encompassing the Roman Kingdom, Roman Republic and Roman Empire until the fall of the western empire.
The Roman Republic (Latin: Rēs pūblica Rōmāna, Italian: Repubblica romana) was the era of classical Roman civilization beginning with the overthrow of the Roman Kingdom, traditionally dated to 509 BC, and ending in 27 BC with the establishment of the Roman Empire.
The earliest form of a company which issued public shares was the case of the publicani during the Roman Republic. Like modern joint-stock companies, the publicani were legal bodies independent of their members whose ownership was divided into shares, or partes.

The basic cause of starvation is an imbalance between energy intake and energy expenditure. In other words, the body expends more energy than it takes in. This imbalance can arise from one or more medical conditions or circumstantial situations.

LSD shows you that there's another side of the coin, and you can't remember it when it wears off, but you know it. It reinforced my sense of what was important, creating great things instead of making money, putting things back into the stream of history, of human consciousness.
Anecdotal reports show that microdosing LSD can help with increasing creativity, can facilitate greater focus, attunement of attention, positive impact on mood, and overall improved function and quality of life.

Too much freedom seem to change into nothing but too much slavery, and offers himself as the personified answer to all problems, to replace the elites, and rule alone on behalf of the masses, and as people thrill to him as a kind of solution.
Democracy was defined as a political system which maximizes two things; equality and freedom. Everyone is equal, and everyone can do whatever he or she likes, and the longer democracy lasts.
Tyranny is probably established out of no other regime than democracy.
One of Plato's major works on political science was titled Politeia and in English it is thus known as The Republic. However, apart from the title, in modern translations of The Republic, alternative translations of politeia are also used.
