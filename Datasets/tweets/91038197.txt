@bernabephoto Wow, I somehow missed this story!
@modestholdings Seriously. The least useful by a wide margin is Twitter. Completely useless.
@modestholdings Oddly, Facebook is by far my best platform for my photography. Nothing else is even close.
I don't know a single @instagram user who is happy about the disappearance of the chronological feed.
Dear @instagram , maybe listen to your users and get rid of the damn curated feed.
@GrayConnolly Thank you very much. Happy Easter to you!

@RadioFreeTom @HumphreyBohun Cruz is just disgusting to me.
@RadioFreeTom It will take a while. This election is surreal, as is the stupidity of the voters.

As much as I despise Cruz, supporting him now is the only way to stop Trump and allow for a contested convention.
I feel strongly the best-case scenario now is to deny Trump 1237 and have a contested convention.
I still contend this is true.  https://t.co/xWpoc48X9m
