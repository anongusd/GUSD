Lets look at what has changed in the last two decades or even the last decade to cause children to feel the need to shoot up a school. Social media and more kids being prescribed drugs to cover up a chemical imbalance.
So here come the gun lies of school shooting in 5, 4, 3, 2, 1. There has been 31 time a gun discharged on school grounds, however when you look at actual school shooting there has been 7.  Which is still to many.  Stop believing false propaganda that pushes an agenda.
