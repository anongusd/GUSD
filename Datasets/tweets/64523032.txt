@DaveWarstler 3/2/12 was the big hailstorm. Friday afternoon. Had just produced a tornado. Did millions in damage.
From a tiny snowburst ⬇️. Only the fortunate received. Be careful overnight and early tomorrow morning. Anything wet will freeze. https://t.co/wyJfeOP8r0
Misty flurries now working their way out of Will Co. At or below freezing now. Expecting low of 22°, wake up wind chill 11°. Few slick spots possible but no big deal. Wind helped dry most roads. Cold few days ahead. It's still winter. https://t.co/OwgqhkvvMn https://t.co/neYaQGGwZ7

No local torando concerns *right now* though we may have concerns later tonight. #1 concern is another night of heavy rain, with rainfall rates up to 1" per hour possible. Flash floods obscure washed out roads, stall vehicles, and can sweep you away regardless of speed and power.

@Kaylenluvs No clue ^wm
Just Issued by NWS: Flash Flood Warning for Davidson and Williamson County until 9:45pm CST Saturday.
@DRErskine Storms need fuel to get bad. These storms have fuel, they seem to have outrun the good fuel. Therefore they may not be as bad as feared. However, this is just the first wave of storms tonight.
Cloud to ground lightning strikes have been observed near Sylvan Park. This cell is moving into downtown Nashville. There are no severe thunderstorm or tornado warnings currently in effect for Nashville or Williamson County.
Storm Prediction Center mesoanalysis indicates storms outran the big storm fuel which has not made it into Williamson County or Nashville. Dewpoint remains under 60°. This is encouraging. However, radar is being closely watched. Wind dynamics are strong.
Torrential rainfall with flash flood potential has entered Western Williamson and West Nashville. Radar image from 5:37 PM. Currently there are no tornado warnings effective in either of our counties. https://t.co/BTIQ7ysyeM
@misscaseyk Goes at 6. data by 645ish. ^wm
@Milly79 Scroll our TL ^wm
The flash flood threat continues tonight with additional thunderstorms capable of rainfall rates around 1 inch per hour. https://t.co/wuzDk1NBpB
There may be two  two waves of rain and potential severe weather activity. The current wave is number one. The second wave is behind it. See below. I'm not sold on how strong that second wave will be. Will reassess after this first wave of heavy rain comes through. https://t.co/MRrgH29TUx
Right now our svr threat is forecasted to last until 11pm tonight. Once the current line passes, we can examine the state of the atmosphere behind it. Uncertainty exists in this situation.  ^wm https://t.co/dHQ4xBNHTp
@landertb Good Q. ^wm
Additional tornado warnings are possible over the next couple of hours. However, the main concern is flash flooding and strong winds toppling trees.
@bluebird1059 Ok ^wm
Good news is that the rotation which prompted the tornado warning in Hickman County has broadened and weakened, so the weather service went ahead and canceled the tornado warning.
@PrestonReyome @HickmanSevereWx For sure, the county controls them. No one else.  ^wm
When this torrential rain arrives, whatever you do, do not park underneath a big tree. Tornado or not, the winds will be strong, the ground saturated, and the risk of tree fall is real and meaningful.
Meanwhile, at 5:26 PM radar indicates a substantial amount of torrential rain is going to come through. I do not recommend driving during the 6 PM hour from Nashville south at least to Franklin due to flash flooding concerns. https://t.co/Jtq0EixRkn
@PrestonReyome Use @HickmanSevereWx ^wm
@sbglasser We think it’s possible. ^wm
@Maize_AndBlue You may need to shortly. Not right now. ^wm
As the storm approaches, it gets closer to the radar and gives us a better look of what is really going on. The storm is moving very quickly, northeast at 60 mph. Those in Fairview, Bellevue, Riverwalk pay special attention.
At 5:20 PM I circled the area indicating the area where the radar appears to indicate tornado. Nothing has been confirmed yet and the storm is pretty far away from the radar site. The storm will move into Williamson County before 6 PM and will be closely monitored. https://t.co/VwXTOgsG6z
Updated ETAs on the cell warranting the tornado warning back to our SW. ^al https://t.co/v98pkmDJdT
@PrestonReyome No part of Williamson County is warned rn ^wm
If this tornado-warned storm stays on its current path and speed it will cross through Fairview around 540, then Bellevue around 555, then Belle Meade around 6 PM. If you live in the path of the storm do not wait until the last minute, stay informed for changes to ETAs https://t.co/1n0H2dMb1P
Here are some rough ETAs on the storm with the tornado warning on it entering Hickman County. ^al https://t.co/B2zd2loj0z
A new Tornado Warning is out for the cell in Perry County. It will track towards Hickman County and then, if it continues, into Williamson County. Image from 5:07 PM https://t.co/7ugHf38M3K
@tbat00VFL Amazon is cheaper. ^wm
Additional torrential rainfall ongoing in North Nashville where a Flash Flood Warning continues. Radar from 5:03 PM. Encounter a flooded road? It's not worth it, turn around, find an alternative route. https://t.co/ITOkfa2zII
@notsureifkevin Not sure. Depends what’s happening at the moment. They’ll either circle of divert if they can’t land. But, they’re really good at this. ^wm
At 4:58 PM a line of very heavy rain with some lightning and potential to produce a tornado is located just West. Already it has a Flash Flood Warning to our W. Plan for additional flash flooding when it arrives in Will Co and S half of Nashville ~ 6 PM or so, maybe after. https://t.co/GV0QRTYE95
@kfen1970 Continue ^wm
@michaeljasper88 @SouthKariya We expect off and on thunderstorms this evening in all of Davidson and Williamson County. ^wm
New criteria for #tspotter reports. Water impacting homes, not threatening homes. New roads closed by water coving them, not threatening them. Please send pics and location from a safe distance. Thanks! ^wm
Currently in SW Middle Tennessee, storms are feeding off plenty of storm fuel. Ideally, the storms themselves will race off towards I 65, and leave the good fuel behind, like a defiant, disobedient toddler. https://t.co/4QxjcMr66R
@MF121032 Yes… ^wm
Andrew is live on Periscope about the Flash Flood Warning for those in Nashville north of downtown. https://t.co/6Kea3GsCK2
@KristenInTN You missed it. ^wm
This area covers a lot of hilly terrain where there are hundreds of low-water crossings which are potentially dangerous in heavy rain. Do not attempt to cross flooded roads. Find an alternate route. Ask yourself, is it really worth it?
New Flash Flood Warning for those along and north of Briley Parkway, including Madison, Hendersonville, Goodlettsville, Joelton, Fontanel. Heavy rain across this area should create flash flooding shortly. See the map. https://t.co/FUMiuxrAGL
Flash Flood Warning Davidson Co https://t.co/AahWGzm0F5
Just Issued by NWS: Flash Flood Warning for Davidson County until 7:30pm CST Saturday.
@usabowlergaming Quite the contrary. There is good evidence that living near a mountain or a hill enhances wind strength and tornado damage.
@krazykylepreds @PredsNHL Just think, a few minutes later you will be seeing an avalanche. Quite the change.
RT @heymistahdj: @NashSevereWx I've always enjoyed Brad Panovich's (@wxbrad) analogy on a Tornado Watch vs. a Tornado Warning - https://t.c…
@_brontide22 Almost everybody tonight is going to get an additional shot of heavy rain. Hopefully that's all we get.
@exile_here By crowdsourcing a lot of other semi-reliable stations, I think it's probably just under 60°.
A tornado watch is in effect until 10 PM.  (A watch means conditions are favorable for tornadoes. A warning means a tornado is imminent or occurring, shelter immediately.) Storms are starting to form in SW Middle TN and will be closely watched over the next handful of hours.
@becka_1978 And thanks for following. ^wm
@becka_1978 You’re Welcome ^wm
@dark7string You got that in writing from anyone? ^wm
@ApeGilmore1 When was this taken? ^wm
All eyes are on this area. Storms are forming along a warm front that's trying to lift into Middle TN. Will they make it to us? Maybe, maybe not. Watching this area closely over next several hours. Already one tornado warning on it in NE MS. Image from 422 PM. https://t.co/aSu00xvv6o

@iheartmemories1 That particular line probably not but more storms are coming.
@NatalieHennes Further. It was a comment about Metro, not about other places. I'll be sure to keep Will Co directly informed.
New Significant Weather Advisory for this area of torrential rainfall, frequent lightning, and 30 MPH winds on their way into Nashville, mainly impacting those along I-40 and points north. Image from 358 PM. https://t.co/dx6q1taMA9
@maddogesq Or so he said, lol. Something about Mardi Gras. It was quite the rumor.
@maddogesq These pilots land in much worse stuff. They can handle it no problem.
Joelton, Fontanel, Bells Bend, later Bakers, Hendersonville/Goodlettsville should expect torrential rain, additional flooding, and perhaps 30+ MPH winds in this thunderstorm. Velocity/Wind image from 353 PM. https://t.co/HfZwtIZiR8
@RScootman @MboroSevereWx @RuthSevereWx Thanks for the info, however #tspotter is best used to report severe weather and flash flooding that impacts road or structures. ^wm

@Rkw3838 @CumberlandWx @NWSNashville Totally true. But were it flooding into the highway, we’d have reportable criteria.  ^wm
@liv__faria Depends on risk tolerance and availability of other safe options.
@maddogesq I went to HS with a guy named James Weaver and everyone thought he was dating our chemistry teacher.
@cook4money No, there are two waves, see previous tweets.
@PFTinTN It's not helping.
Really want this line to push north of Metro but looks like it will at least hit us north of I-40. Tornado concerns not that big with this line -- the stronger tornado fuel is further south -- main concern is flash flooding and strong winds. Also, lightning. Image from 3:45 PM. https://t.co/Bw0zzrdb6O
@jam911 Glad they’re on it. ^wm
@Rkw3838 @CumberlandWx @NWSNashville Thanks for the report, however #tspotter is best used to report severe weather, flash flooding, wind damage, etc. ^wm
Details, summary about the Tornado Watch issued until 10 PM tonight. https://t.co/dfTuUXhRGv
@elijahnewman We don't forecast for 95% of that route.
@noahmckay116 It's under control for now.
@LoribethDunlap See previous tweets. We are not giving specific timing because we don't feel comfy doing that yet.
Would really like to see this storm turn north of us. It's packing a lot of water and of all places in Middle TN, we are most susceptible to this causing big flooding problems and tree fall. Go to the Preds game now y'all, get inside. 317 PM. https://t.co/yr94MAexNt
Dewpoint 55° right now. I'll need to see it rise at least to 60° before I start to get "that feeling" in my gut. That said, it may do that. Mixed layer CAPE (storm food) has steadily progressed into Middle Tennessee. Needless to say we're glued to the radar and other data. https://t.co/3XPxGJrwhp
The new system is a long way from being implemented. https://t.co/R7957KqdNk
It's more likely additional flash flooding will occur tonight with this first wave then second wave of storms. Strong winds will have no trouble dropping trees rooted in unstable, saturated soil. Stay connected for updates. 4/4
We are on the NE edge of the Tornado Watch area. It's possible high dewpoints and concurrent storm fuel won't make it all the way to us, but this will be closely watched. Thus, the tornado concern is *conditioned on sufficient storm food arriving. Tornado *potential remains. 3/4
Storms now over western MS will move into SW Middle TN (and eventually rest of Middle TN, us included) later tonight, as storm fuel, indicated by high dewpoints, surge in, giving us our main severe threat this evening. ETA fuzzy, should be gone by 10 PM or so. 2/4
OK, so let's reset where we are now at 3 PM.		The storms at 3 PM (see below) are not thought to be the big story for the evening. This first wave should trek across the northern half of Middle TN, pulling up and into KY.  Strong winds and flash flooding main concern. 1/4 https://t.co/bYO6Lp7vc4
@thewannabegypsy At some point.
SPC has issued a Tornado Watch for us 	3 PM until 10 PM	Primary threats include...	  A few tornadoes likely with a couple intense tornadoes possible	  Scattered damaging wind gusts to 70 mph possible	  Isolated large hail events to 1.5 inches in diameter possible
Just Issued by NWS: Tornado Watch for Davidson and Williamson County until 10:00pm CST.
This line of rain coming is packing heavy wind and -- perhaps more importantly -- exceptionally heavy rain. It may set off another round of flash flood warnings. Current tornado concern is very low. Damaging winds and flooding top the concern list.
Cluster of storms crossing the TN River have a while til they get here. But, if they keep the same speed, here are some ETAs. Severe thunderstorm warning in effect currently for the storm at the TN River. ^al https://t.co/RzyGsA2dRg
If you're planning on attending the Preds game, get there early. I don't like the look of radar to our west and you don't want to be caught in a downpour or thunderstorm when you're trying to get into Bridgestone. Radar from 248 PM: https://t.co/REbShW6YM2
With grounds super saturated, it won't take much for NWS to issue a severe thunderstorm warning this afternoon and tonight. Trees falling over cars are a concern, so don't shelter from a storm in a car parked next to a large tree.
More unwelcome rain moving in to Will Co. No severe concerns, flooding the main concern, with these. Image from 238 PM. https://t.co/0rDhol4opp
@fmftballmgr How many strikes. White less, yellow more, red more, purple most.
@amyums @RuthSevereWx We don't use TorCon. No one really knows what it means. ^al
@erhswku No one has said that. It has always been conditional. So we are waiting for the conditions to verify or not. The potential is the same.

@VentiixScambait We are not speculating.
At 2:08 PM showers developed SW of us, moving in, should be in around 3 PM or so. Not worried about severe potential with these, but they will be watched. Severe potential ETA 5 PM to 10 PM, in the form of isolated storms then more widespread storms -- assuming they have the fuel https://t.co/eFjAgKBQRW
@JStatesman Low 60s.
@iTim314 @NC5 Ooof. Good call Tim.
@margaretakyser I'd rather you go before then, but 3 PM probably ok
Now that we're in the rain break, we watch to our southwest to see if storms develop. Currently our dewpoint is only 56° (too low for bad stuff) and mesoanalysis shows the fuel needed for storms not quite here yet. If it gets here, watch out. ETA range 4 PM - 10 PM. https://t.co/gZUzRRAPKH
@TaylorT88762474 Please see previous tweets on the subject.
@holidaymomca Should be out of here between 9 PM and 11 PM.
@stnwall That's not exactly right. The confusion with the sirens has to do with warnings not watches.
@jaina_hall I cannot recommend it.
@emilyweisband We get 10" more rain per than Seattle on average. Their "so much rain" reputation is legit because they have more rainy days. But we get a lot more rain.
@kylecox @mb_swain I agree it's not the best wording. But to your point you say watch out! with an "out" and exclamation point. You don't just say "watch."
The Flash Flood Warning for Nashville and Will Co has been replaced with an Areal Flood Advisory.  One more wave of rain moving through now, then there will be a break. However, as more storms arrive later today/tonight, additional flash flood warnings may be issued. https://t.co/EEDfWCZj7c
@mb_swain @kylecox In the military, if you have the watch, you suspect enemy but you don't see them. So you watch.
West Tennessee was just issued a Tornado Watch. Too early for a decision for us on Watch or no Watch. Remember, a Tornado Watch means "conditions favorable, be ready." A Tornado Warning, if issued, means "a tornado is imminent or occurring, take immediate action and shelter."
@kenglenz Thanks for that.
@kelly10sa Daisy, be nice tonight please.

Flood advisories or flash flood warnings possible tonight/overnight. More rain is expected tomorrow, with some breaks. Very windy tomorrow afternoon, be wary of trees falling. Then big storms form and arrive tomorrow night, ETA 7-10 PM, stay updated, expect ETA changes. https://t.co/GIfUTjRDb8
Severe Storm Update	SPC has increased concern level for us from a 2 of 5 to 3 of 5	ETA Saturday night	Probabilities of "x" within 25 miles of us Sat night include:	tornado 10% (a few strong tornadoes possible), 	one-inch hail 15%, and	58+ MPH winds 30% (some may exceed 70 MPH). https://t.co/rOuHf1ZKKI

@MattSha68512711 Models are guidance, not truth.
Latest run of HRRR model shows 3" to 4" falling between now and 11 AM Saturday. 😬. Flash flooding should occur once 1.6" to 2" falls. HRRR doesn't have the best quantitative precip skills but still, yikes. Waiting for (0z) updated models from NAM3, Euro, and GFS. https://t.co/Zb53ljJADO
@abestoklasa Thanks for looking out for us!
@abestoklasa Nah, that's freely available to anyone :)
@RyanBottoms @NWSNashville yes

@nataliesakstrup Worried? No. Prepared and informed? Yes.
"It appears the heavier rainfall will begin as we approach midnight with the most favorable window for heavier rain occurring from midnight to 6 AM."  -@NWSNashville. Possible heaviest rain will stay NW of us but models disagree. HRRR drives heavy rain into Nashville overnight: https://t.co/E63ye7ViPj

@neal_fo88 Reading SPC discussions helps, but the answer to your question requires a lot of reading, teaching, and time.
Check out how fast it's flowing. When a river spills over a road, a vehicle can be easily swept away. https://t.co/07EuGqwDrq
@swf2866 BNA can handle rain.
@Ashley_Sofia There is no way to know for sure. It should be fine to get out, leave yourself time and avoid any flooded roads you might see.
@TotalTrafficBNA It's not lies and truth. Each model is a clue.
@MattSmithCFB Off and on, but the on should be heavy.
Even before storms Saturday night, during the day Saturday winds will be strong. Saturated soils + strong winds + thunderstorm winds may drop trees. Park only unloved cars under large trees. https://t.co/58vjmruWUk
Timing on storms tomorrow night 8-10 PM per HRRR model. NAM3 model has same timing. HRRR shows sufficient instability/CAPE to create damaging winds and maybe tornadoes Saturday night. It'll also be one more shot of heavy rain we don't need. https://t.co/en571lauoJ
It's all about where heavy rain sets up late tonight thru 8 AM Saturday morning. HRRR model suggests just over an additional 1" (yes, please). NAM3 thinks 2" to 3". Euro thinks 1.5" to 1.8". GFS 2.7". Really close call, y'all. https://t.co/nGsDkNuH1P
Light to moderate rain remains shifted mostly into W Williamson Co and Nashville. Nothing particularly heavy. Keeping rainfall rates low is 😍. Image from 3:42 PM. https://t.co/ezK3g3Gg9V
@leroyj82 There are risks.
@tshafer61 It was from a few days ago. That place usually floods.
NAM3 model also now has timing of severe storm potential for Sat night: around/after 9 PM. Do not marry this ETA, it’ll change and you may not love it later. Shows a mild spike Significant Tornado Parameter. It’s not 😱 but it has our attention. Stay connected for updates. https://t.co/AsQ6Xb65Gs
Latest HRRR model is encouraging. Not very many oranges and reds (signifying heavier rain) on the radar coming thru here tonight and overnight. Model may have error so watching closely. NAM3 model thinks we will get more than this. Give me as little rain as possible, please. https://t.co/qGb6AZKcuP

Heavy rain looks ready to move into S Will Co (Franklin or just south of Franklin, Spring Hill, College Grove, Nolensville) and also SE Nashville around Antioch in a few hours. Here flood concern will be greatest. https://t.co/umDoa3hWHd
@HansonSaale There is no ETA for that.
Light off and on rain continues. Heaviest rain still south of us but if the HRRR model is right it’ll shift north and impact us later today and tonight. Flash Flood Watch remains in effect. 3” to 4” total still expected thru Sunday morning. https://t.co/phrYBAfrTt

@bradsmithdooley We had a meeting tonight, five of us, we have a plan. We're good.
I find no value comparing this to May 2010. It's mistake to assume if you made it thru 2010 you'll be fine this time because "2010 was worse." There's no way to know what this event will mean to you. All floods are different and serious.
@ericnordhoff I don't.
Meanwhile, SPC thinks a significant severe thunderstorm event may evolve Saturday afternoon/evening. "Considerable wind damage may accompany these storms along with the risk for tornadoes, some of which could be strong." Much more on this tomorrow &amp; Saturday. https://t.co/THRy6FbcHs
Last full run of the HRRR model taking us through 4 PM Friday puts the heaviest rain south of I-840. But that's just the beginning of this event. NAM3 thinks we'll get deluged with 4" or so through Saturday night. Euro model is around 3.3". Time for sleep, long 48 hours ahead. https://t.co/MdgXXkj6M1
@NinaCovington No model data out on that one yet. https://t.co/kMow9CIQNw
@stalkcabo 2010 was worse.

@weatherguy4life @NWSNashville So far, yeah. But it's only just begun....
@CBW_TwHR We got some gifs.
Update from @NWSNashville: "rain will continue overnight, and still looks to be especially heavy along and south of I-40...[with a] training southwest to northeast storm motion which will allow for heavy rain..." We see this here on radar at 9:59 PM: https://t.co/sKo9vLfcw1

@avecasey20 @NWSNashville We do not forecast that area, sorry
@Forsturdy There is no way to gauge timing sufficient to suggest alternate travel arrangements.
Tonight - Fri night. Off and on rain. NAM3 and HRRR models think under 1” during this time (yes please), GFS thinks 1” to 1.5” (no thx). Euro has more than 2” (do not want). Heavier rain likely juuust S of us. 		All models think additional rain will be here Fri night thru Sat.

@christenpointer @NWSNashville Not made for sure! Just wanted to be emphatic in case someone else was listening in.
@NashvilleFromLA Euro, but that doesn't help you in this event.
@christenpointer @NWSNashville NO!
Southwest of us, or W of 65 and S of 40, is where we think it'll be worse. But, everyone is still going to get a lot of rain. It doesn't have to the worst where you are to get flooding. https://t.co/7ymLc1g4ok
Model data range is insane. NAM3 only has 1" to 1.5" total through Saturday night. Euro model has 5". The key will be where the biggest axis of rain will set up, and there is no model agreement on that. Someone in Middle TN is going to get hosed super bad.
HRRR model through tomorrow morning has most of the heaviest rain missing us. I have little confidence this is accurate but it's better than the alternative of "more rain." However, y'all, we really can't absorb much more rain. https://t.co/I8IbTWzqct

@justinasquith You are equally screwed. If I had to choose, I'd choose daylight travel.
@BritB0301 That's midnight Saturday night, one split second into Sunday morning. The time stamp on that is dumb.
@MollyFerrie @twaller44 We may see flash flooding tomorrow, yes.
@DrWillMartinez Very small.
@patrickparham @threadreaderapp Hmmm, interesting. Thanks.
@AirborneGeek Nope but for this event IDC.
5 of 5. Still, that's too much. We can't take much more rain.  Once we get over 2", flash flooding is almost certain to recur. This isn't forecast to be as bad as May 2010, but it doesn't have to be that bad to be bad. Be ready, y'all. Respect the risk, seek updates. https://t.co/J5coqjo9lT
4 of 5. However, 5" may be too high. Euro ensemble guidance thinks right around 3.0" total, through Saturday night. GFS only has around 2" (see below). NWS-Nashville thinks the rain totals will be between 3" and 4", with locally higher amounts possible. https://t.co/8UvuvbDqgh
3 of 5. Thus, the message here is everyone can expect, at the very least, another 1"+ of rain thru Saturday night, but the concern is where that "training" heavier rain will set up. I'm concerned, if not alarmed, that the Euro is training 5" of rain Thu night thru Sat night. https://t.co/lOyZQrOZb2
2 of 5. HRRR model only goes into Friday night. It's going to rain hard Saturday, too. The NAM3 model goes 24 hours further than the HRRR, into Saturday night. NAM3 has a "training" rain total up to 3.1" over a 48 hour period (Thu night thru Sat night). https://t.co/O6OyyYPPZZ
Flooding Potential Update, 1 of 5. HRRR model this morning thru Friday 6 PM predicts about 1" for us. It *also* paints a "training" line of heavier rain dropping 2" to 2.5" into S. Will Co. This may shift. Where this "training" line actually sets up is key to flooding severity. https://t.co/Hdi8RmbPb2
@TRH_MTSU I fear that'll be worse Saturday afternoon.
@avoiceofhope Wrote that in Yoda voice I was.
@belaj https://t.co/XzDUGstFjU
It will all depend on where the rain sets up and “trains.” We could see just off and on rain, but as the rain axis forms it might set up atop us. That’s what we do not want. https://t.co/f8N9l70Ow1

@michaeleherman It's like a "hey, this thing may hit flood stage, take action if you need to get out." [Words, mine, not theirs.] They typically issue a flood advisory (below a warning) at that point. ^al

@shafetoberfest Maybe they park there because insurance pays more than the resale value.

@RainettaD Lightning is crazy.
@1geepa @MollyFerrie Hi Molly. The creeks will recede and are receding quickly. The small rivers (like Harpeth) are still rising. They'll be slower to rise/fall. The Cumberland gets all of it, but it has another 4 ft before reaching minor flood stage. It'll be the slowest to rise and fall. ^al

Area of sleet/rain mix is moving N along the leading edge of the precipitation shield. It will switch over to mainly rain rather quickly as the air quickly saturates. ^al https://t.co/og6eiIYwKo
Because the air is so dry aloft, the precip is beginning as some sleet. No worries, though, just kinda cool. ^al https://t.co/ABRcKGStzl
The air temperature is 40° at BNA with a dew point of 26°. The air is pretty dry. For the precip to become heavy, the air will need to moisten up over time. ^al
@ohboyrecords Precip should start in the next 30-45 minutes. ^al
@gsager35 It's not looking good if this lightning keeps up. ^al
@jdham1976 For now... ^al
Quite a few of these lightning strikes are registering as "positive strikes." They're incredibly powerful and can be very loud. They can be the dominant lightning type in winter, so they're not too unusual this time of year. ^al
@autopsy4 If we thought so, we would have shared that information. ^al
At 1:36, this rain looks pretty gnarly, but in reality, the radar is picking up on ice up in the atmosphere. Actual rain rates at the surface are lower. This is called "bright banding." Still, some lightning possible. ^al https://t.co/M6xqsxlGPK
Yup. And it's working into Will Co now. Note no travel impacts from wintry precip expected. Anything that falls will melt fast. Wet roads, tho, that's another thing. https://t.co/0YBJbyYygX

@ughnoname @thosedrones @NWSNashville That was a tsunami.
“...It is very likely the forecast bands of heaviest rainfall will continue to shift a bit with each forecast, so keep the large scale heavy rain pattern in mind.” Uncertainty about where the rain train will line up laces comparisons to past flood events with potential error. 2/2

@_uptoolate_ @deppisch I've been getting 2010 replies for about a week now.
@z_rob90 Specific data not yet available. NWS will issue flood products when it's time. That question is like asking how much snow will fall in 5 days. We don't really know. All depends on where that heaviest rain axis sets up.

@Bulldogs63 I'm not getting into that.
@stevewrightr Songs were written about that tweet before that tweet was written.
@Anthony_Vandy3 @MattKing1975 For all areas, yes. A colder atmosphere is drier.
@Bulldogs63 There is no value to this conversation. Is there uncertainty? Obviously. That's precisely why comparing a known all time worst event to a forecasted event is of little to no value. The message is Flooding Likely.
Thought I was quickly responding to "will this week be another 2010 flood" and, um, well, I may not have hit reply. My reflexes are that swift. FTR, no one is forecasting 2010 rain totals/duration, which were epic. Still, flooding is flooding, even if it's not the worst ever. https://t.co/ZG73GoK4AK
@deppisch Anyone forecasting a repeat of 2010 is fishing for clicks and shares. Flooding is flooding, but 2010 was incredible. Comparing a forecasted event vs an historic rain is a waste of time.

@wcsPageMScg Right now we think rain should end around 3 AM. So don't leave anything out overnight. Also expecting wind chill 31° at 9 AM Saturday morning, 39° by noon. So chilly but probably manageable, if you can stand the cold.
Thru March 1, Euro ensemble model predicts rainfall range totaling 4.25" to 7", with the mean around 5.75" (BTW, total snow mean a quarter inch lol, with probability of 1" of snow 1%). Another ensemble model, GEFS, has rainfall mean during this time 👇around 7". https://t.co/BAG7fspreC
@existentialcry1 There is no snow in the forecast.
@BNA4L @cipearman That sounds more like a climate question to me.
@zacorem It has to do with some complicated physics. No really easy explanation.
48° now. Windy, gusts to 34 MPH this afternoon, high 63°, chance a very light shower streaks by. HRRR model: https://t.co/4HsFvQ8D83

@51downingst Low 40°s, rain Friday night probably over by then.
@existentialcry1 Nope.
“but falsely equating.” Ooooo. Nooooo. Trying to turn a phrase, but slipping and falling, with no edit button. #by https://t.co/G6LWfot44z
@ZombieTrev5k @iamallisonsmith @just1nbruce @NWSVegas @NWS Never change, Trevor.
4/4  A new 12 hour rainfall record was also set when 7.20 inches fell on May 2nd, 2010.  		A new 6 hour rainfall record was also set when 5.57 inches fell.		There have been floods. They’re all bad. Set them in proper context. 2010 is king.
3/4  A new two day rainfall record was established when 13.57 inches fell on May 1st and May 2nd, 2010. **Other reliable local measurements logged more than 16”.** 👇🏼		Thus in two days we set an all time record for the most rain ever for the entire month of May (set in 1983). https://t.co/bDybk87tON
2/4  In Nashville, a new 24-hour rainfall record was established when 9.09 inches of rain fell on May 1st and May 2nd, 2010. 		Old record was 6.68”, from September 1979 was second, when remnants of a hurricane came thru.
1/4 Yes, rain so far this month and this year is way above normal and more is on the way. 		And water in your basement in 2010 or 2019 is still water in your basement 👎👎.		But let’s not minimize the severity of May 1-3, 2010 but falsely equating it with what we’ve seen in 2019.
@cipearman @BNA4L No one I’m aware of said this is a 100 year rain.
The GIFs in this thread tho. https://t.co/QTOkdA5jMD
@Crackerjen I like to think I have better jokes. But nope.
@bucksrunit Looks like two storms will pass to our SE next week - usually they make us snowmen - this time nah.
@mauititan The river float life is underrated if you tolerate giant snakes.
To put the rainy forecast in perspective, we've already had 6.18" of precip at BNA in February. Red line is "normal." Green is what has fallen. Models are suggesting we may need to add some vertical space to this graph. ^al https://t.co/PXk56N23cl
@RunnerKel February average at BNA is 3.94 inches. So far, we've observed 6.18 inches. ^al
@singularmindset "I will never put a curse on the ground again because of man. I will not  do it even though his heart is always directed toward what is evil. His  thoughts are evil from the time he is young. I will never destroy all  living things again, as I have just done."
@SDarlin22 That's the thing. It's Feb, you'd think one of these systems passing to our SE would bring us some snow but so far decent model data is all nah.
For perspective, we got up to 6.62" locally last Wednesday Feb 6. Good news is future rain appears to be spread out evenly, every few days or so, which should help calm most (not all) flood concerns. https://t.co/h5NTAIeJ6R
Data shows legit series of heavy rain events coming and frankly it's not funny anymore, if it ever was (hint: it wasn't and isn't). Euro ensemble says 50%+ prob of 5" total over the next week, 12z Euro thinks 4.5" to 6" total over next 10 days.
@jasonleemusic We will, eventually.
Finally, A Dry Day! More Rain Expected Later This Week. Our fourth intern applican, Zach, brings today's forecast. https://t.co/xwNxtEoNjT

@drkbrf Evidence the worst rain has passed is apparently in your crawlspace. Sorry about that.
@Horsegeek40 We stay away from speculation unsupported by data.

@mattb291 If God tells you to build it, you should.
Flash Flood guidance says 1.5" over a 6 hour period is too much such that flash flooding would be expected. Don't think we will get that much but it'll be close. Otherwise, localized flooding is a concern, especially Tuesday.
Late this afternoon more rain begins. Heaviest late tonight and tomorrow morning. Ending around lunch tomorrow. 1.5" to 2" expected. Flood Watch effective for Nashville. https://t.co/d150glb0DM

@THuddJ @Poulette @shadycat_lady https://t.co/6rnaGUjjH7
@THuddJ @UTDave @shadycat_lady Let me ask a question: What's the virtue in opposing interrupting a TV program for a tornado warning that may impact someone in the community? Isn't this a matter of convenience and entertainment vs the small chance someone could be hurt, or worse?
@THuddJ @UTDave @shadycat_lady I think they want that ability. As I understand it, the broadcasters hate doing it. Eats into their bottom lines. The airwaves are owed by the FCC, and they get them for free, as long as they agree to broadcast certain important things.
@THuddJ @Poulette @shadycat_lady One other thing before we go further. Let me say thanks for discussing this in a mature, rational way, and not stooping to name calling and invective. It's nice to have an honest disagreement that rests on the quality of the idea and not the ability of someone to be insulting. https://t.co/SQC9EHL49D
@THuddJ @Poulette @shadycat_lady I'm sorry TJ, but that's just wrong. These TV people have to cover something like 40 counties. The odds of them getting to the information relevant to you are low. Also, most TV stations cut in only for Tornado Warnings. They save other stuff for commercial breaks.
@THuddJ @UTDave @shadycat_lady One reason I know on-air people explaining something is better than asking the public to read it on a screen competing for their attention is because when you went to school you had a teacher with visual aids and explanation. You weren't put in a room and told "just read this."
@THuddJ @UTDave @shadycat_lady A person can deliver: 1. much more information, and do it more efficiently 2. establish a tone -- which social science says is as important than the actual information -- that's key to effective communication 3. anticipate and respond to questions,
@THuddJ @Poulette @shadycat_lady Wait. I must have missed something. Are you talking about cutting in over a Flash Flood Warning?
@THuddJ @shadycat_lady So, let me be sure I understand. The information is important, you just want it scrolling across the bottom of the screen, which is “good enough” in a life-threatening situation?
@THuddJ @Poulette @shadycat_lady You think the majority of people don’t want long-form wall to wall coverage of a tornado warning?
@j7drou It’s blinding for sure. #08Altima
@THuddJ @shadycat_lady Info isn’t repeated. The storms move. The info updates. 		The safety of a few outweighs the convenient entertainment of the whole. 		The unaffected viewer also has options.		A crawl is much less effective than a live meteorologist. 		No solution needed when nothing needs fixing.

@musicians_wife I should have added -- the current technology is obsolete and needs to be replaced. Even the federal government, usually the slowest to adapt to any tech, made this change more than 10 years ago.  What they have now simply cannot do what they need it to do.
@fonnadoley First, good job, and thank you. I don't secretly wish the tornado would drop on them, only because the horror of that happening is so much worse than how good vindication would feel. I am trying/failing/learning to be compassionate to those who hate, it's a spiritual thing.

Cold rain nears. Arriving over next hour. Few snowflakes possible but no worries. https://t.co/SqzCSNRFUu
Neither impacts nor travel concerns with this batch of precip. We will warm quickly above freezing around sunrise.
That heavy rain will encounter very dry air, and it’ll also be very cold. This should evaporate some of it before it hits the earth. @NWSNashville “wouldn’t be surprised if someone saw a snowflake or two mixed in with the rain once it finally rains at the surface.”
Heavy rain will move in around 6:30 - 7 AM or so. https://t.co/Nl8FufVTHA
@musicians_wife It’s not an issue of maintenance. It’s like going from horse drawn buggies to cars. You can feed the horses well, doesn’t make it a car. And we’ve got places to go. Those saying it’s a maintenance problem don’t know what they’re taking about. Also the budget is like $2B.

Road/pavement temps near the TN/KY line are in the upper 50°s. The air temp is 12° colder. Very unlikely temps a few degrees below freezing tomorrow morning will freeze watery roads. Whereas air cools fast, surfaces take much longer. No winter weather advisories are out.

Excellent question! Check this for data: https://t.co/qYrmnWcRDE https://t.co/FRL63OgcWz
@cacdows Were we indicating a trend? No.	Were we reporting a record high temp? Yes.
We'd need at least 1.1" of rain in a three hour period to substantially raise another flash flood concern. None of the models think that much will fall that fast. Nevertheless, we should still see some localized flooding with river/streams elevated. Flash Flood Guidance map 👇 https://t.co/TyuUCx1Okw

@DavidAOSullivan Andrew is really good at it. Thanks for saying it. He's a key member of this endeavor. His most watched scope!
@Mcgruff011 Very, very low. Nothing like last night.
It may be heavy at times. Another 0.5" to 1" total tonight. None of it welcome. Flooding may recur. But this won't be nearly as much as we got last night. https://t.co/oQqpEmsSm0
Thin line of briefly heavy rain will cross during the 4 PM hour. Then a break. Then more rain later tonight. https://t.co/kyL2pHXT18
@pnwfarmlife Just some rain, gusty winds.
@lrlandiss 0.5" to 1" total. Hopefully less. Nothing like last night, but then again, the ground can't tolerate much more rain.
First splash of rain here on radar, arriving in time for the rush hour. After that, there’s a break. Then more rain tonight. https://t.co/GU0JxZb3Zh
@MikePaul44 @NWSNashville It's really frustrating. BNA reports temps, but the thermo uses C and the software converts it to F, except the C temp is rounded before the conversion. It's a headache.
@MusicBeerPizza 👎
@dmatkeson21 There are two problems. Sirens go on too long (not a new problem BTW), and they sound to alert the unwarned.
@VirginiaVoigt It's going to rain here but I don't think I should recommend a decision.
So due to a conversion error by the official themo, @NWSNashville says we've only officially made it to 78° today. That ties the warmest temp this early in a calendar year. We hit 78° three times in January, 1911, 1950, and 1972. https://t.co/5S1QQoiwkX
No. Reasons: All precip tonight will be water, not ice or snow. Surface temps are baking, relatively speaking, ground is warm. We'll only be below freezing by a few degrees for a handful of hours, and water takes longer to freeze. The wind will be howling, drying off some roads. https://t.co/BYiQvjDycr
@zdubya11 @draymer72 We have opinions. I just don't want the noise. We leave climate science the climate people. We do weather.
@_megscholl It was the record for the calendar day February 6, not the most to fall in any calendar day. ^al
The Feb 7 record high is 70° (2001), which we shattered. It's 77° now but we hit 79° earlier. Also I think Matt's right, 79° on Feb 7 is the earliest 79° on record in a calendar year (80° would be, too, but cloud cover should eliminate that chance). https://t.co/Gaj2rFVxpJ
I hate that this tip turned out useful. https://t.co/7TcC0YmUSU
@magicalgoojelly None tonight or tomorrow. Still got Feb and early March tho.
No real severe weather concern tonight. SPC update nerfed all severe outlooks. We're excluded from their Hail/Tornado/Wind outlooks. Flooding the only concern, though we should get only a small fraction of what we got last night. Tho IMO a sneeze is too much. https://t.co/3NcgcBKCvN
Another 0.5" or more expected to begin tonight around the PM rush hour and run off and on tonight. Areas that had heavy rainfall and flooding already could have more problems. 2" to 3" more rain expected early next week, dumping into rivers running high. #NoThanks. https://t.co/zYydqF7do8

Several more arguments support modernization. You can find them below, citing other examples, other research, based on social science. 		It’s now up to us to ignore the evidence, or follow it. 7/7		https://t.co/HvUVLyZweL
“‘The vast majority of Joplin residents’ did not respond to the first siren warning of the May 22 [2011] twister that killed 162 people because of a widespread disregard for tornado sirens, federal officials concluded in a report issued Tuesday....” 6/7
A study by Simmons and Sutter (2009, p. 38) found:		“a one-standard-deviation increase in the false-alarm ratio increases expected fatalities by between 12% and 29% and increases expected injuries by between 14% and 32%.” 5/7
...Long lead times and high false alarm rates tend to depersonalize risk.” That’s intuitive, right? 4/7
“...the one common ingredient to a successful end-to-end tornado warning program is the personalization of the warning; to be successful, warnings must evoke a sense of specific and immediate risk.... Social and cultural factors may inhibit personalization of warnings... 3/7
“An integrated and redundant dissemination system is more robust.”		Yet our sirens and NWS warnings aren’t redundant, they’re frequently contradictory. Sirens blare among the unwarned, and continue wailing long after the warning has been cancelled.	2/7
Excerpts from my siren research: 		In 2013, smart guys Brotzge and Donner published The Tornado Warning Process: A Review of Current Research, Challenges, and Opportunities in the Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society (Vol. 94: Issue. 11, : Pages. 1715-1733). 1/7

Windy today, high 76°(!). 		Little/no rain this AM thru mid afternoon. 		Another 0.5” or so of rain begins ~ late rush hour, ends ~ midnight, ahead of a powerful cold front, see HRRR model below. 		Temps plummet overnight. Low Friday AM 27° (!!). That’s a 49° drop 🥶. https://t.co/yYvtrTRAYm
@NWSNashville has cancelled our flash flood warning in Davidson and Williamson. Do not attempt to cross flooded roads. Numerous flood advisories continue for rivers and creeks. ^wm
Thankfully rain is pulling away to the N. for now. However more light rain could occur off and on through today. Some roads are still closed and we are still under a flash flood warning in both counties until 8:30 because of that. Check local news for maps and details.  ^wm https://t.co/Iuqgq8bYnS

@debkey123 @MayorBriley The social scientists disagree. So do other large metro tornado prone areas. Like Birmingham. Oklahoma City. Or read the Joplin tornado service assessment. Overwarning causes siren fatigue and people ignore the warnings. And it creates confusion during emergency.

@AlexaSa16 Yes. A tornado warning just expired there. ^wm
Currently there are no tornado warnings in Nashville or Will Co. Future warnings are possible if justified. Those of you east of Bellevue who've heard the sirens blaring were falsely alarmed, again, @MayorBriley. There's a fix readily available.
@dman535 Not right now. ^wm
The  threat is not over yet for any additional spin ups with this storm, so  any rapid intensification will result in a warning issued as fast as possible. Winds south of I-40 in Davidson county look to be around 40 mph, with some gusts to 50 mph possible with storm outflow.
Really tough call on whether to extend the tornado warning...NWS decided to let the current tornado warning expire, it will not be extended further into Nashville. Nevertheless, we need to keep an eye on it in case a new warning needs to be issued.
@jayce2300 Not now ^wm
Some of these spikes in the radar data may be attributed to the storm's rear flank downdraft, possible this tornado warning will be extended further into Nashville and N Will Co. Waiting for word from NWS.

It's common for these storms to produce brief tornadoes, then cycle weaker, then reproduce a tornado. The tornado debris signature on the NW tip of Will Co was brief and suggests perhaps a brief tornado touched down. It will have to be surveyed later to be confirmed.

@SOB15 I can't speak to all roads/routes but it's a good sign the heaviest rain has passed. It's dark, don't drive through flooded roads.
Light rain in, heavy rain out, of the Flash Flood Warned area. That area can still experience flash flooding, warning expires at 8 PM. Meanwhile, strong winds 40-50 MPH possible as storm races past Cane Ridge/Antioch into SE Nashville and NE Will Co. Image from 6 PM https://t.co/3gTzDH4ZL1
@shelbyburon Heaviest rain now east of 65.
@flyingsaab Depends on exactly where you are of course, BNA has us well over 1" tho.
BTdubs, check out the HRRR model 24 hours from now, around 6 PM Thursday, when the cold front comes and blasts away our warm temps. February's back tomorrow night! #PartyPoopa https://t.co/rnokPSXqsZ
TBNA measuring winds almost to 40 MPH for this storm moving into Antioch and Cane Ridge now.
With torrential rainfall, @NWSNashville now advises 50 MPH winds possible with this storm moving toward Antioch, Cane Ridge, Percy Priest, Lakewood Village, ultimately crossing to LaVergne https://t.co/jBRpErrI8T
HRRR predicts off and on rain tonight and overnight, varying intensity, until everything settles down for the AM commute. https://t.co/XvHUhfJRv1
Looking regionally, lots more rain is downstream, of varying intensities. Will post HRRR model's prediction about what this will do. https://t.co/7f4t8vVO0f
At 5:46 PM heavy rain located now along and S of I-40 down to Cool Springs, all swinging east. No severe storm worries currently, a flash flood event so far. https://t.co/WYeLrQdrJM
@luciecam3 Depends on exactly where you are.

@zoeeemarie Not always. I-24 is the worst. But water will pond in the ruts of the lanes.
@jenniferg07 Sorry, exceedingly unlikely.
@CBeasley_ @NWSNashville You'll get heavy rain.
Heavy rain positioned along a warm front, sending heavy rain ENE, pulling in moisture from the south like the Death Star's tractor beam (Star Wars reference, sorry not sorry). Image from 444 PM. https://t.co/FkopZGoI2q
@MomMusic That's how + strikes do it.
@kylecox @NWSNashville Later tonight.
Lots more rain coming to this area over the next hour. https://t.co/BtKw01g7yy
Safely-taken photos of flooding with your location tweeted to #tSpotter improve the warning process. Flash Flood Warning has been issued to our west in Dickson, so if you see risen water, let @NWSNashville and everyone else know. Thanks. Radar from 4:36 PM. https://t.co/crUaz0erYJ
Yes, located just N of the I-40/Charlotte exit. https://t.co/k2Y13LRqA1
@MsVadasKidsRock Yikes.
Jerk rush hour timing by this thunderstorm, has a lot of water. Areal Flood Advisory issued. Expect localized flooding. Radar image from 426 PM. https://t.co/BT3TEhVQP6
That lightning strike was near Upland Drive. I turned off the radar data so you could see it.  It's a positive strike, 10% of all strikes are positive, they're beefy powerful. https://t.co/l3bz2x0hav

To review, current Areal Flood Advisories in Middle Tennessee, one for most of Nashville, the other for most of Will Co. It's called "Areal" because it's technically correct, not because Little Mermaid, although this does drive home the point: https://t.co/oFrNHibmNS
New Areal Flood Advisory for Nashville. Heavy rain will truck through over the next hour or so. Turn Around,  Don't Drown. https://t.co/JFT4ohrC5a
@OPKitchen I don't see how it doesn't!
Very heavy rain, some lightning, heading into Nashville. This will sadden your rush hour. Watching everything for any signs of rotation, but tornado worries are very low. Image from 403 PM. https://t.co/v42gcP2pUQ
@bluenique62 It'll be nasty for a while. Heaviest rain maybe for 15 minutes? ^al
Next round of heavy rain looks to make it into downtown around 4:30-4:45. Currently non-severe. ^al https://t.co/qAxIB3tuPV

This, at 234 PM, is what prompted the since-expired tornado warning for those east of us. That warning has since expired. No worries for us right now but this is why we are watching it. https://t.co/o7PP5cVk5D
@jdwest041 https://t.co/y4VilgmCCe
@StevieRenfrow some. not particularly frequent.
@UTGlover It's not for Davidson or Williamson. It's E of us.
HRRR model through 5 AM shows heavy rain/frog stranglers and weak thunderstorms moving through later this afternoon and tonight. https://t.co/r5odjQvz1z
@jensnashville Next hour or so.
At 158 PM heavy rain with thunderstorms are lining up to our west and moving this way. No current severe weather worries, but flash flooding may be discussed later today/tonight per the latest WPC precipitation discussion: https://t.co/r5GzUfNZ8H
@rockcrobsta Storms ride that front. That's why we're watching so closely despite very little to see.
Storms riding that warm front limited. They're tapping woefully insufficient convective available potential energy (CAPE) to strengthen. Very little lightning, updrafts inept, all good signs. Tornado potential remains very low despite plenty of shear.
Meanwhile, the warm front has sunk further south over Will Co, observations show 8F difference between Nashville and Spring Hill. https://t.co/2tZDyXQFE4
At 102 PM, heavy rain continues in Will Co. Still watching this circled area for rotation, but it looks pretty tame and of little/no concern. https://t.co/ClFgWWsBzL
At 12:41 pm, the rotation in the "significant weather advisory" storm has relaxed and broadened significantly. We're still watching it. Anxiety level still low. SWA in effect until 1:!5 pm for 50 mph wind gusts possible. ^al https://t.co/p30cLZ6r1V
@Titanbill1 Hey thanks! Glad to. ^al
This is the storm with the significant weather advisory. We're in the NE corner of the polygon. It has weak rotation with it, but may stay S of us. 50 mph wind gusts possible. ^al https://t.co/7BZpPXe6gc
Significant Weather Advisory for W Central Williamson County until 1:15 pm. Winds to 50 mph possible. ^al
At 12:16 pm, we're watching a storm back over Hickman county that has some weak rotation with it. Moving ENE. Anxiety level is low, but we're watching. ^al https://t.co/qWDqLGmrPg
Heaviest cell so far will push into WillCo over the next 30 minutes. Wouldn't be surprised to hear a few rumbles of thunder with it. ^al https://t.co/p9rt2Bu2ij

At 1024 AM, rain line sinking south into N Nashville, and a downpour cluster forming to our SW. Deploy umbrellas this afternoon. No lightning activity so far, so current shenanigan concern is low. But expecting a few thunderstorms later today. https://t.co/8ExnVeMDBu
@MF121032 It will be off and on today.
@Horsegeek40 Sure.
@FRACarltonMath It almost goes without saying. Almost.
Satellite shows breeding ground for our afternoon heavy rain/storm activity, currently located in N MS and SW TN. Also went old school with the music notes to denote our location. https://t.co/mOt38dh1O5
At 922 AM heavy rain is all north of us in KY. Models expect rain/storm activity to shift south to us this afternoon and tonight, where heavy rain, a few thunderstorms, and a low-end tornado risk exists. Alarm level: heart rates slow and steady, but coffee &amp; watching radar.... https://t.co/5y1TXbjPTF
@ShelleyJennings I prefer the AM
Updated Storm Prediction Center outlook keeps us - barely - within that 2% tornado risk. This means the probably of a tornado within 25 miles of us is 2%. We are watching. https://t.co/NTPJbU7bBs
Risk of severe weather is low but not zero. “The primary threat is damaging straight-line winds. Otherwise, extensive cloud cover will keep a lid on deeper instability, so strong updrafts are unlikely.” —@NWSNashville  Tornado worries low.
HRRR model thinks heavy rain and thunderstorms will be off and on this afternoon and tonight: https://t.co/NFnilWIKJC
As heavy rain and storms roll through this afternoon and tonight, we need to keep an eye out for a very small risk of a tornado. Storm Prediction Center says 2% probability of a tornado happening within 25 miles of us today. https://t.co/sfe8PXjZtT
@CBW_TwHR All that is going NW and N of us.
@Vol_Hoops @JDWearington Nice.
@MaryGClose No great times. Too off and on. I’d wake up then decide.
HRRR model predicts off and on heavy rain and some weak storms tomorrow. https://t.co/ndAke0HFVq
@JT_Michael Um, whoa.
@devinmaddox Yup, Super Tuesday Outbreak.
HRRR model (18z run) now to midnight Wednesday thinks most of the rain will be NW of us tomorrow, with passing showers and maybe a weak thunderstorm for us through the day. https://t.co/L0Oebzchyz
@chrisrouse Good news is you have EAS alerts, NOAA weather radio, and social media. Some experts think no outdoor siren system is better.
@MattDudleyTN Has nothing to do with downtown per se. Those tornadoes often cycle. There is theory/speculation of an albado effect but that doesn't answer more questions than it raises.
@ProcReg @BrdgstoneArena There are few places I would have rather been. I was a total hypocrite tho, not sheltering. With a TDS on dual pol radar tho, I would have climbed under the basement.
@iceflyer101 If we had dual pol radar then, I would not have been looking out the window. Also I wanted to be close to information.
@Cellblock303 @iceflyer101 For some reason I remembered the Ducks but there it was, 1-0 loss to Carolina. I could not stay in my seat. I had been gifted good ones too.
@iceflyer101 I refused to basement. I watched that supe come over downtown from the top floor steps, looking out the window toward the Hilton. Briefly the trees went nearly parallel to the ground. Then it was gone.
3/3 ... an EF-3 tornado in Sumner and kept going all the way into KY. That tornado traveled 50.32 Miles, Damage Path Width 880 yards, Fatalities: 22, Injuries: 63. For more info, other tornado info that night: https://t.co/Rwbw8lR72H. 		I hate tornadoes.
2/3 I was at the Preds game the night of February 5, 2008, not watching hockey. Instead I was watching arena TVs, local mets covering of the unfolding outbreak and looking out the window at the supercell that dropped an EF-2 over Will Co - lifted over Nashville - then dropped... https://t.co/RW5BCDj07I
1/3 Tomorrow we're forecast to tie the record high of 71F, also set in 2008. What was happening 11 years ago on Feb 5-6 to drive up those high temps (that won't happen today or tomorrow)?  A horrible super-outbreak of tornadoes. https://t.co/Kyue4TvedW

@KenPreds Yes. When it gets cold, the air is dry, and the column of air has to saturate for precip to reach the surface. It's all about evaporation.

@matthewmorein16 See previous tweets, that'll fix you up.
@PutABridgeOnIt @NWSNashville It's primarily a mid-latitude phenomenon. Other places don't have all the problems making, or not making, snow.
@AndrewLeeper @shelbyclark123 What he said. He is us. Us is him.
The beginnings of what many mistake for a snowdome. It's really just the Dry Air Monster eating (really, snow evaporating) around 2,000, and the radar makes it look like a dome is forming. Radar beam goes straight, earth curves away, a circle forms. 10:53 PM. https://t.co/K2k2yCZCNX

@NC5_BreeSmith @wxkaylee13 This is why we are friends Bree.
BNA now reports a dew point of -1°. That's some legit dry air, only encouraging the D.A.M. to consume. For 45 minutes now, no snow has made it below 2,000 feet anywhere in Middle TN. https://t.co/4tqA4wcn1w
@wxkaylee13 @NC5_BreeSmith The Dry Air Monster is true art you guys. It does not sell out to commercial interests. It belongs in the museum, not the museum gift shop. It should be studied, not sold. People should look at it and feel something meaningful.
@travhaney Teed that up, and you hit it 320 yds straight down the fairway
@lukejhill We are now friends.
@AnastasiaTynda1 No.
@RyunVail They're doing complete scans every 10 minutes, so we'll see it if it is happening. I expect the snow will get closer to the ground through the night, but it's been over Paducah for hours and nothing has reached them yet. We will see.
@NC5_BreeSmith He's surprisingly fun at parties, too.
It's currently snowing over us, but it's being eaten by the Dry Air Monster before reaching the ground, as confirmed here by switching to the Huntsville radar: https://t.co/MKrOxYoZDM
How long will the D.A.M. eat? He's been known to belly up and clean out a Shoney's Buffet. He and Ron Swanson are friends. I once heard him refer to Joey Chestnut as an amateur. Tonight's weather balloon - which reveals his appetite - suggested he's hungry. https://t.co/rMiNweVTE9
At 10:14 PM, Dry Air Monster is seen around 2,000 feet, eating all the snow, preventing it from getting to us. He is either hero or villain, depending on your point of view. https://t.co/db3fi92ep2
In the last three radar scans, it appears no snow has survived below 2,000 feet. So far. D.A.M. must there, eating. https://t.co/L1LG3SHz8F
@SMast29 It's my hope school decisionmakers can operate at a higher level.
..., we bravely confront the cold limits of foreknowledge, just happy we have a massive golf ball shooting radar beams at precip, providing at least some reliable evidence we even know what's going on right now.
As @ZombieTrev5k puts it "attempting to predict the timing, elevation, rate, &amp; total amount of H2O undergoing phase change (or not), in a turbulent, chaotic env. using equations so complex we need high powered computers to even attempt it," and those computers have 👎tonight...
We think it'll all evaporate before it reaches the surface. I am as confident in that as I am in NFL referees. (Non sports ball people, that is not a high level of confidence) https://t.co/c8wdkFJxNT
@jwage We think it's evaporating just before it reaches the ground.
@a_garland98 I'm nervous so concluding but yeah probs.
Paducah radar has snow over it, suggesting the snow is evaporating only 900 feet above the surface. Behold this excellent illustration:		5K feet	* snow	*	*	2K feet	* still snow	* 	900 feet	Dry Air Monster "what's up you guys nom nom nom"	[nothing]	____Earth_____
Next radar scan due shortly, snow is seen by radar as close to the surface as 2,300 feet. Either that D.A.M. is laying real low to the surface, or he's being overwhelmed and we're about to get another shot of snow. https://t.co/7wYwgC7BvJ
@hgc_14_2020 IDK
@JayDavid1987 Only one way -- feed him so much snow he stops eating.
@MattyH2309 Wish I knew Dwight, but pipes are bursting on Schrute Farms and your beets are froze.
@jeffbrownKW The data is, the software costs $$$. Lots of free places to get radar info tho, if you understand how to use it.
This area of snow aloft (or to the surface?) is moving around 30 MPH. So, ETA, 11 PM or so, assuming the rate stays the same, and also assuming it is, you know, actually a thing. https://t.co/LCSUXmktrr
@jasman777 Undoubtedly.
@dalipals_martin IDK but on my face is not amusement.
Snow aloft nears, seen at 9:35 PM on radar at 2,600 feet. Where you at Dry Air Monster? You gonna munch this or not? https://t.co/poI2mhuyz4
Paducah NWS office has no reports of any of this hitting the ground. Lowest level of the radar detects snow at 3,000 feet and higher. Dry Air Monster confirmed near the surface. We think he gobbling, and none of this will reach the earth. Do I trust this? No, no I do not. 👀👀👀 https://t.co/ZrXScQXMjf

@jasman777 Very little actual water content was in those flakes. They hit, settled, then slowly compressed.
RT @NashvilleEOC: Metro will open an extreme cold weather shelter tonight, Wednesday (1/30), at Shelby Park Community Center, 401 S 20th St…
@Wiznardo 🙀
Andrew measured 0.38" of snow in Nolensville, but it melted/compressed into only 0.01" of water. Incredibly high snowfall ratio. Usually it's 10:1 or 15:1. That was 38:1. Expect most/all of the fallen snow to disappear through the morning and afternoon.
HRRR, NAM3, Euro all think tonight's system will stay in Kentucky. We'll be watching for any shifts in that track through the day. https://t.co/wzI3gDlqju
@knitteratnight No thank you. Good reminder

@bethjadams @medievalismish @NWSNashville IKR. Two days ago it whiffed on yesterday, then came back around.  Euro went back and forth. It's why to never rely on one model.
@BlueTide_8 @NWSNashville It's going be way below freezing all day. There is no refreezing, only freezing.
At 8:53 AM the snow band is soon departing Antioch, in Cane Ridge and Lakewood Village, and about to be a Rutherford County thing. https://t.co/wBQpOKA3dc
@hferrell33 Cane Ridge then Rutherford Co
Also peak spring storm season. Sure hope there's not a tornado warning only for Joelton because sirens will go off downtown. With the nation watching, it'll cause panic, which, at best, will be merely embarrassing. Keep 2019 tornado free, especially April 25-28. https://t.co/OsCxGt9HIW

Snow now in Antioch will continue to move SE down I-24 and into Cane Ridge, then pass into Rutherford County. 843 AM radar image. https://t.co/TGgOTxNRxf
Today's high 22°, but sunlight, winds, and the really dry atmosphere (you'll need lotion if your skin cracks with dewpoints below 0) will help diminish it some. Also, we did not get very much. https://t.co/dltHTX6HXZ

@existentialcry1 What the models all thought would be snow is on the plateau right now. Stuff coming through currently is weaksauce.
Flurries, light snow extending from Fairview (confirmed by our camera there) to Joelton, all moving into Nashville and probably into N half of Will Co. 1059 PM. Surface temps a few degrees above freezing and dropping, ground temps a bit warmer than that. Very cold aloft, hence ❄️ https://t.co/OfwDrvnSuZ
@Brodie_dad Maybe a few flakes, but not the bulk of it.
Snow surfing arctic air, but ground temps still should be much warmer.  Be cool on bridges and overpasses tho, as this moves into the city. 1050 PM radar image. https://t.co/BSSNdXkNXH
@brothercountry1 1115 PM or so
@brothercountry1 To where?
Ft. Campbell road sensor says the air temp (30°) is 12° colder than the pavement temp (42°). This does not include bridges and overpasses, which follow the air temp more closely. https://t.co/tmdou8Y1JU
Nice little shot of snow trying to work in now as the arctic temps spill in. Expect a lot of this will melt on impact, but if it slows down, we may need to start talking bridges and overpasses caution. https://t.co/qn6STnjN8e
Winds should really start to gust now as the frigid air nears.
@PhillthyG Ha Ha thanks! https://t.co/kxg4k2zCgY

Don't be alarmed tonight if you hear wind related creeks. Seeing gusts up in W KY of 29 MPH, 23 MPH, 26 MPH etc as temps there drop below freezing. Cold gusts will be here tonight while you're zzzzz/watching Netflix in bed. https://t.co/MMRTOlfnDk

At 906 PM, most of the rain is east of us. Flurries falling near the radar site near Ft. Campbell should move along the TN/KY border and not bother us. Current temp 45°, dewpoint 40°. Meh. https://t.co/l2lUeQaPjQ
@existentialcry1 My fault, there was an older version of that. Will Co is included, but the precip is 2/3 of the way out of there. Few worries, if any.
@existentialcry1 That's an old advisory.

This seems unlikely. All roads are different, so no one answer. But, we're still several hours away from freezing, which takes awhile. Precip has been light. Winds drying us out a bit, blowing 8-10 MPH, and will increase overnight as the colder air nears. https://t.co/KsUvUHwsBP

@wx4castr I don't know for sure, but usually the "code red" hype comes from marketing dept. The mets know better.
Tonight's precip maker on radar 1:12 PM. ETA after dark. Freezing temps expected to be behind it. Flakes possible the further SE you go, initial flakes splat/melt. Subfreezing temps will pour in behind it, trying to freeze light rain running off and being dried by winds. https://t.co/brMddrSn3B
@GoGatorRob It's OK. Blame me.
@kelizabethjs I think I can find a screenshot of just about every forecast solution.
@kelizabethjs You mean the one that said 3" to 6", or the one that showed no flake and no precip?
@TheRealDanielCu @KingTammie Yes. Give me a powerful storm with a deep 700 mb low passing from Huntsville to Knoxville.
Resist recency bias! The trend toward no/less snow doesn't mean this event has already happened and nothing fell.  Although forecast certainty increases as the ETA nears, we sit without blessed assurance we totally know our snow future 12 hours from go time. https://t.co/2SzEjCoE60

@clydeumney It’s about the same. Just depends on the type of event.
@kevbo58 Very good rule of thumb. These frontal snow events are wrought with problems. Give me that strong low passing to our south any day.
@Scottz281 “No clue?”
@volgolfer7 Then it wouldn’t be a forecast.
@JamesRBrown_3 Dunno about school.
@MassadMajed See previous tweets :-)
If you find yourself upset, lashing out, or concocting some nefarious forecast conspiracy, ask yourself: “did I read the entire forecast, or just the headline/clip art? Was I promised anything? Was I warned the forecast may change? Have I embraced uncertainty?” https://t.co/H4SsoIW0wS
@wkufan92 Front is drying out.
@volgolfer7 No.
@jdh4999 It never snows here. Right.
According to the HRRR model, those further south and southeast have a better chance to see maybe a little snow. This run has a little snow in Will Co. https://t.co/bBCaaUjxVt
@jdh4999 Strawman.
@hninterista27 Which time? The time it concluded 3" to 6"? If it changes its mind 8 times in 5 days, one of them is bound to be "right."  I'm fine with it making a forecast. I wish it would express the uncertainty of the forecast and stop making it seem like forecasting is a guessing game.
Some, not a huge, concern. It depends on how much rain actually falls, how much time rain has to run off, and the speed of that arctic air -- it'll be 62° this afternoon! Also winds will be steady and help dry roads. Different roads hold ice and water differently. Stay connected. https://t.co/H659jrFlph

@landrysmith Privately, yes.
Balance of updated model data trending toward less snow overnight Monday-Tuesday. Precip may be pulling SE before frigid temps arrive. Few tweaks in timing can bust or make this event. Either way, any lingering precip may freeze Tuesday morning — if there’s enough of it. https://t.co/TKQvK6zP3J
0z NAM3 model shows rain changing to snow late Monday night. This is around/less than 1”. Some models think more snow, others less. Less snow expected NW, more snow SE. All models agree temps will drop into mid/low 20°s early Tuesday morning, freezing snow/rainwater 🥶 https://t.co/3MzT9rmHRf

@hodge_e There's no line. This needs a series of prob bets tho.
@_scharlie22 The Euro is one big piece on a game board. See the entire board.
Therefore, the data remains inconclusive. Apply skepticism, esp to apps! Nobody ever got smarter by studying more, healthier by eating garbage, or better prepared by relying on clip art. More later today. (If I seem irritable today, I'm watching the PBS/Ken Burns doc on Vietnam).
Fourth, the high res data is not yet in range, so pump the brakes everyone. Snow is in the details. The NAM3 run only extends to 7 PM Monday (see 👇), and that's rain coming in too fast to inspire forecast confidence. SREF and HRRR also not in range. https://t.co/iSgz037Lh1
Third, the NAM12, occasionally profound but usually Cousin Eddie, is also on board, and suddenly, we see a trend developing in the data. https://t.co/4uniOJtu4I
Second, the latest GFS (12z run, below) has a little snow, also Tuesday morning. GFS has been waffling, but its ensemble version predicts a little snow here Tuesday. The waffling doesn't instill confidence in the slumping GFS., the Erik Gudbranson of weather models. https://t.co/OYmKx8gvfQ
Waiting for NWS data before publishing website update. Until then, comments about the models. 		First, latest Euro continues to predict snow Tuesday morning.  The Euro ensemble approach agrees, thinking almost 2" is the mean in a wide range of possibilities.
@_scharlie22 See the whole board.
@CodyASutherland That’s better than most crap apps but the range of potential goes beyond that graphic.
@SUPERROOFINGLLC not sure what that is other than those SW getting under the color threshold except Fairview because elevation.
“Will,” it says. Expressions of certainty predicting Middle Tennessee snowfall accumulation 72 hours from now, while ignoring contrary data and inherent inescapable uncertainties, sits atop Mt. Intellectual Dishonesty. And all who’ve lived here just one winter know it. https://t.co/D5bYeGfIEQ

@bonjovigirl1972 No. It’s not helpful. There’s 0. There’s 8. There’s everywhere in between.

@brbeaird @NWSNashville I don’t use them. Like asking a doctor what’s the best fast food joint.
@Delish_Paleoish I’m not a fan.
5/5 GFS model seems to be the lo/no snow outlier. Euro and NAM models consistently show snow. Euro ensemble has us just under 2”, with more the further north and east you go. 		Remain skeptical, but constantly seek truth. Not this: https://t.co/33EZLbTK4i
4/5 “...lesser amounts would be	expected if one leaned totally toward the latest GFS solution. Additional model runs along with forecaster meteorological interpretation will be needed as this time frame approaches for the latest/best reasoning on potential accumulation amounts.”
3/5 “...Presently, it looks like the highest accumulations will be for locations around and north of I-40. With this set of model runs, total snowfall accumulations in this area could be between two to three inches with amounts one to two inches south of it ...
2/5 “Still too early to determine actual accumulation amounts, but it is continuing to look more and more likely accumulating snowfall will occur across the mid state region Mon night into Tue morning ...
1/5 Crap apps are waffling on Tuesday’s snow chances. Gone one minute, 3” to 6” the next, changing every hour. You need information, not deterministic crap app clip art guessing totals. Here’s the @NWSNashville discussion about Tuesday...
@alisabethfuller It’s such crap, isn’t it.
@frankiewx @NYRest1926 I’m about to plug up!
@smashvillegold Euro has loved this event and still does. So does Euro ensemble. NAM too. GFS flipity flopety. Still so much time. 0” to 3” is the current range.
@smashvillegold A forecast app vomiting deterministic GFS output is the worst possible app.

@CBW_TwHR No way. Can’t see that as a temp. Maybe a wind chill.

BTW, timing fail, these are *after* rush hour flurries. New update about to be hoisted. https://t.co/KT3Ilwt0Co
@RhettFast It's unlikely we'll see another event like that in our lifetime. That was so many levels above anything we have seen recently.
@designbydad Coming soon. https://t.co/iBVcaalFaZ
PM rush hour flurries expected by HRRR model. No worries, no impact. https://t.co/rCQ9J3e1Xd
@m_kwest We wrote about it last night on the dot com.
Good news. Still below freezing for a few more hours. https://t.co/OVxoJTN3Qe
@willycardin Tuesday morning. But yeah, maybe. Weird system, low to the north but cold enough for snow here? I’m looking at the data all ORLY
28° now, wind chill 18°. Winds around 10 MPH all night are continuing - a big help drying roads. Be wary of wet appearing surfaces. May contain ice.
Very very light snow falling in west Nashville. No issues expected. ^wm https://t.co/wxIQcDcDAl
@whaleiams9 Posted last night to our blog, update later today.
The radar seems very faint returns as snow flurries. No impact as expected. ^wm https://t.co/QQC0TDDRs3
@malinapeters You’re Welcome       ^wm
So... not much happened overnight. However, there could be some slick spots, especially on bridges and overpasses. Before you ask, there are no widespread travel related issues. Cold and sunny today. High of 40. ^wm
Not terribly concerned about AM black ice but assume nothing if you're up early traveling. Be particularly wary of bridges, overpasses, areas at elevation. Temps will fall into upper 20°s overnight. Undried roads may contain black ice. Hopefully, winds will continue to dry them.
Freezing temps now in NW Nashville, extending to the 24/65 split, continuing to move SE down I-24.  Air temps colder than pavement temps.
@AustinDixonWx @tempestchasing Be sure to feed your tauntaun. You made need him.
Few personal weather stations in N Nashville and Fairview report freezing temps. Pavement temps almost certainly warmer than that. Everyone else still above freezing. (BTW, was reviewing other data: the wind chill Friday morning is 9° 🥶)
@notLukeSkywalke Hard to say. I wrote this: https://t.co/Zv7hFRP7gv
@Noahty99 We're always referring to Nashville and Williamson County, unless otherwise noted.
Freezing line still NW of Davidson Co, sitting between Clarksville and Nashville. Those are air temps; surface temps will cool at a slower rate. Winds sustained 14-15 MPH last hour, assisting the runoff/drying process.
@rickbergen16 I don't think so, but I see your point. If I grant your point, it's a big leap to suggest we are rooting for people to have a car crash due to icy conditions. That's a non-sequitur. Especially considering we're spending countless hours advising the public of weather safety.
Data at the TN/KY border shows pavement is 7° to 10° warmer than air temps. https://t.co/UCMcSPDXpb
@rickbergen16 Man are you misreading that.
Official language for all of Middle TN from @NWSNashville: "leftover water from today`s rainfall could freeze into ice on some area roadways late tonight into Thursday morning as temperatures drop into the 20s."
For ice to form tonight, air temps must drop below freezing (36° now), then surfaces need additional time get cold enough, all before rainwater runs off and winds dry the roads.  Some slick spots are possible, esp on bridges and overpasses, decks, which form and hold ice first.
@MollyFerrie It'll all dry at varying rates. But you gotta cool the air, then you have to cool the surfaces. Takes time.
37° now at BNA. Clarksville at 32°. Freezing line taking its sweet time coming down I-24.

@JohnFSloan Hard to say. Tough drawing conclusions with this sample size.
@ile3000gt I was trying to cheer us up!
@Java_Nick Yes
Rain racing east, should be gone by 7-8 PM, with no snow. Only lingering issue is potential for some Thu AM slick spots when temps start diving below freezing after midnight. https://t.co/QhNN7obU9E
Seattle has more rainy days than we do, but it's not rainier. Just more depressing. We average about 10" more per year than they do. So far this year we're running just over 1" ahead of normal. #Roz https://t.co/GY3hT6iPLt
8-10 MPH winds will help dry roads. Earlier-than-expected departure of rain (ETD 7-8 PM) will allow more time for runoff. Freezing temp ETA midnight, down to 27° around 6-7 AM, above freezing late morning. Small window for any standing rainwater to freeze. Stay connected.
@Kellymweymouth That’s the $$$ question. Probably 7-8 PM or so.
@memphisweather1 Main concern is frozen temps + rainwater.
Rain coming thru a bit faster than HRRR and NAM3 models thought. This suggests even less snow, and it may speed up arrival of colder temps and create some slick spots overnight - mainly after midnight. We will be watching temps more closely than radar tonight.
Very wet commute ahead. Current radar: https://t.co/7ZWgOzIqHw
@FigLeeLee We ooooooze forgiveness here, LeeLee.
@kristenicole18_ Many more chances after this one.
8/8 Travel decisions may have to wait until the morning. Many routes may be fine, others maybe not. Decisions will be a function of your specific reasonable alternative(s) and risk tolerance.  More later, stay connected.		 PS. (Bridges and overpasses)♾
7/8 It'll be breezy not windy (drying roads), and water will runoff through the night because of...gravity. Travel impacts will be road specific and dangers won't show themselves. The key is whether we stay around 30°-31° overnight, or drop to 25°-26° from 4-5 AM to 8-9 AM.
6/8 This isn't a sled event. It's a wet roads, black ice, poss. freezing event. 1st, bridges &amp; overpasses, then maybe some roads, with ice formation occurring overnight, while dark, with conditions worsening right around the AM commute.
5/8 Then the 1 hour Euro model, which thinks this is mostly a rain event, with a quick shot of snow from 11 PM to 1 AM (splat/melt), with freezing temps arriving around 1 AM and staying until noon. For five hours the Euro thinks we'll be 25° to 26°, mostly during AM rush hour 🥶
4/8 Unlike HRRR, NAM3 thinks we'll get much colder overnight 😬, dropping below freezing after midnight and staying there until noon (!), with coldest temps around 26° or 27° during the morning commute. No thanks! Ice, ice, bridges and overpasses, too cold. https://t.co/mubqFuFBha
3/8 Bridges and overpasses will collect any ice first. Those traveling overnight, be wary! 		Now let's chat about another model, the NAM3. It also predicts heavy rain this afternoon and tonight, changing to very little mix/snow between 11 PM and 1 AM 👇 https://t.co/BIcsY57ZHo
2/8 First flakes will go splat and melt on the wet, warm surface. Falling snow should speed surface cooling (duh), but even though temps aloft may support snow, HRRR doesn't think surface temps will be very cold overnight, hovering around 31° through 4 AM (see below)... https://t.co/VxaUa9KdDE
1/8 While you chew your delicious [insert sponsor here! LOL j/k] lunch, munch on the latest weather data! 		First, below, the latest complete (16z) HRRR model run, shows heavy afternoon rain (a washout, 1" total), then a few hours of snowfall around 10 PM to midnight. https://t.co/KQA55TILP0

We may need to make travel decisions early Thursday morning.
Thursday morning’s familiar uncertainty. 		Very little snow. Wet roads. Temps crashing into the upper 20°s. 		vs. 		Already warm surfaces, cooling at varying rates (air cools faster than roads). Winds help water runoff and dry roads. Temps warm after sunrise. https://t.co/g0Q4ptwJGD
HRRR model thinks rain will pull east by 9 PM without changing to snow here. NAM3 disagrees, thinks precip will still be here by 11 PM with light snow briefly falling. My main concern is wet roads, temps below freezing around midnight, and staying below freezing until 9-10 AM. https://t.co/2wTi1eAifq
@SDarlin22 Or @Montcoseverewx
@ColbyLong Low probability it’ll be icy by 8:30 PM. Stay connected tho.

@JamesRBrown_3 Apparently them. I am sure they're staying downtown tonight. https://t.co/Glb4LcgaYf
@MikePaul44 They run about $15-$20K a piece depending on the site, and require maintenance and paying for data to be recorded and stored. Also you need a secure location.
Almost every personal weather station in Nashville and Will Co shows 32° (&amp; dropping). Elevated surfaces, bridges and overpasses will ice first. (Usually people stand behind Crispy's post game show at the Preds game, but looks like everyone is wisely getting out to get home. 👍) https://t.co/KuuVYxRZZT
@MelADavis Yeah, I did not see that before it went out. Thanks.
@realchaas I'd love to have one on 65, 40, and 840. That's where I'd start. Then get to secondary roads. Like Ellington and Briley Pkwy. And one on a bridge or overpass.
Temp was around 40° as you filed into Bridgestone for the Preds game. Current wind chill 24°.
And so it begins...can't beat the source, either! Thanks Craig! https://t.co/8WbF1lPK0x
@bmonshor We can study it, find out exactly when roads freeze with various temps, dewpts, winds, etc. No data, no science.
TDOT fixed the signs. Thanks y'all. https://t.co/NlZirb3tyN
Clarksville is below freezing, now at 30° and still falling. BNA now to 34° and falling. Local Nashville and Will Co personal weather stations around 34° to 32° and falling. https://t.co/mur7Wuyh2x
Props to TDOT's salting efforts. It's a hard job and they do a good job with the resources they have. #Respect https://t.co/YFF8TWyJkN
Despite TDOT message signs, there is no "Winter Storm Warning" in effect. Not even a Winter Weather Advisory for Nashville. But the rest of the sign is 💲💲💲. https://t.co/DPFQs9Deih
@Adam_Twining001 Thanks.
@kambermusic https://t.co/2lwfCNYAdK
@bmonshor Especially in Middle TN, it's often snowing but above freezing at the surface.
@TRH_MTSU See all the other tweets. I don't know what else to add to this question.
Sun 1/20 - Wind Chill Will Make Temps Feel Like Teens &amp; Single Digits. Icy, Early Morning Travel Impacts - Early Morning 24°, High 29° - Details: https://t.co/HtJ0SIWpKW https://t.co/7y9LpOvmRt
Some flakes in the air with the main snow band hung up in W KY and not looking so strong. Keep in mind the main concern is leftover rainwater + any additional snowfall freezing. Don't really need snow to raise concern about ice forming on some roads. https://t.co/yBD1vdfAsk
@jenshow Not enough for a snowball tho! Maybe late next week!
@lovessheldon31 @eric_8675309 https://t.co/MeNuC4Zz3D
@hazelmonday3 The entire state of Kentucky. Or commonwealth. Whatever they are up there.
@wx4castr We use it for the ratio of air:pavement. Obviously it's colder there.
Personal weather stations showing first freezing temps now in higher elevations in Fairview. Those temps will soon push in to NW Nashville. BNA at 36° and dropping. https://t.co/khd2ByYmUj
@chriscornwell Usually state or local governments. They're expensive. You need them to be all the same type and calibrated, so the data produced can be studied allowing reliable, actionable conclusions to be reached.
Areas of snow rotating in. Most precip west of I-65 is wintry mix/snow. 834 PM. https://t.co/uTuDZRWcZX
@angiemagnino Not tonight!
Tonight illustrates a big gap in our local functional weather infrastructure -- our lack of a series of air/pavement/subsurface sensors on local roads producing data that can assist forecasters, emergency managers, and schools on knowing when roads will soon become hazardous.
@randyhandSF24 Winds are strong, extent and duration of hazard very difficult.
@HercFamily5 As time passes, hazard increases.  All depends on your risk tolerance and access to reasonable alternatives.
@CoachBarryV Probably, not definitely.
@DRErskine That one is all me. I am not enslaved by art.
@KLThomas88 It'll eventually dry out thanks to strong winds.
When exactly ice will form depends on many things radar, weather stations can't tell us. Don't cut that 11 PM ice ETA close -- it's estimated time, there's a margin of error of an hour or two either way -- consider your risk tolerance/alternatives before making travel decisions.
@CoachBarryV 11 PM ish
Forecast graphic. https://t.co/ILfLJzQ8ta
Those at Preds game and otherwise out -- if current trends hold (stay connected!) @NWSNashville estimates surface temps will stay above freezing until 11 PM or so, streets should probably just be wet until then. Be especially wary of ice potential on bridges/overpasses.
Precip should start as a mix first, then transition to snow. Temps aloft are c-o-l-d, easily below freezing. Surface temps have to make it to freezing before there are impacts. Remember, it can be below freezing overhead and above freezing where gravity set ya. https://t.co/jgy0xPOgXE
Don't be fooled by blue snow colors on radars, that make it seem snowier than it really is. Left, snow color radar. Right, reality, not so bad. Radar from 752 PM.		Until surface temps drop to/below freezing, there are no worries. https://t.co/2DCOPSXHLj
@RalphCarter That's QPF output, assuming it all sticks, which it shouldn't.
Once the air temp reaches freezing, we can start getting concerned about ice forming and sticking to bridges and overpasses. When might that happen? I think as soon as 9-10 PM. Chances of icy conditions increase through the evening.
Temps will drop quickly tonight. Local personal weather stations are already in the mid/upper 30°s and dropping fast. Clarksville already at 33° as a north wind there howls at 20 MPH, gusting to 29 MPH, bringing freezing temps fast. https://t.co/q0BZa7sltn
Local and regional radar views at 730 PM snow falling to our NW, working closer to us. BNA reports 39°. Road sensor at I-65 near KY/TN border shows pavement temps 8° warmer than air temps. Remember bridges/overpasses will more closely follow air temps, and thus ice over first. https://t.co/kxc6udvE3b
@robyntrowbridge @RuthSevereWx That as 40 mins ago. Snow is much lighter there now. ^wm
@walkerwashubear Uh. Don’t do that. ^wm
Currently, the radar is seeing snow aloft over Dickson, but freezing temps at the surface are still closer to Jackson (more than 70mi west). This means the first snow we see will melt right away. Currently 46º at BNA. ^wm https://t.co/bSMDorWMAw
@charltonwalker1 Current forecast has us getting less than 1”. ^wm
@axisjeremy Sorry, Padre. We’ll have to see what happens. ^wm
@jemalone615 See previous tweets ^wm
@Phurnix It’s going to be 27º and possibly slippery. ^wm
Great question. Wherever you’re driving in Middle Tennessee, road temps are still in the upper 40’s. They won’t be an issue for a while. ^wm https://t.co/nUsvfj1XcN
@Nashville_MMA Freezing temps arrive after snow fall starts. We’re talking about two different things.  ^wm
It’s all over but the freezing. Light rain will still fall, but our attn is now going to turn to temps. We expect them to crater over the next few hours. METARS temp data is right in line. It’s currently 33º in Memphis and 53º in Nashville. Snow starts around 9pm accums &lt; 1"  ^wm https://t.co/c29DVPufWJ

@LoniPolk247 Not end, but switch off for a while.
@FlyingLunchbox If you see that Zoltar machine holler.
Dusting to 0.5" for us per @NWSNashville forfreecast. Impact: "Additional snow combined with rapidly cooling temps expected to cause slick spots on roadways in addition to bridges and overpasses." ETA ~ midnight. Below graphic includes low probability low end/high end scenarios. https://t.co/HT07uSRFsf
@FlyingLunchbox That's right, maybe even by 12z.
... Expect no real advance warning a road contains ice. You can't see it because it looks wet, and may be icy. All that to say, check road conditions before venturing out. Bridges, overpasses, areas at elevation will ice first. Biggest concern timeframe: midnight to 9 AM.

@ChrisHHowell My art is original. That is derivative. https://t.co/v9D1FAZjE2
@MarkCarneal Has to do with 0.25" ice or 3" of snow.
Main concern: bridges, overpasses, sidewalks, decks, and areas at elevation gathering ice from ongoing snowfall and leftover rainwater. Roads may also be impacted. HRRR model shows how, in less than 12 hours, we'll go from 60° to below freezing. First freezing temps ETA midnight. https://t.co/BbJM15DV4O
Strong winds increase late this afternoon and tonight, gusting to 30+ MPH. Secure loose objects. This is a blessing, will assist drying very wet roads.
@TClemdenen (In case anyone else is reading this ...) My objection is you lurking in a conversation, pulling out our comment about 2012 to support a conclusory assertion we aren’t making, and doing so without setting it in the proper context. Then mischaracterizing our position.
@TClemdenen Yours is an anomaly map. If you look at the 2m temps from that same run, it’s cold but not Euro cold. https://t.co/7E5l8E0sFZ
@TClemdenen We aren’t ready to say that right now. GFS shows it much warmer. This was only a discussion about potential.
@OPKitchen On these days we nap when we fall asleep. (But seriously, this is why there are 3 of us)
@jdcaughel @Scott06686332 @RyanMaue We’ve been afraid to even discuss that data. Saw it yesterday. Some of the coldest temps since 2012.
Temps near 60° this afternoon, so snow will melt at first. Temps will plummet after midnight, freezing any snow or leftover rainwater. Elevated surfaces, decks, overpasses, bridges, should gather ice first, then maybe roads. Very windy tho, which helps dry surfaces. Us tonight: https://t.co/AjFnEP9Oe0

Saturday’s event isn’t snowdome because snow isn’t laying siege. Snowdomes require snow all around you (all 360°) but not on you. Most domes (ala Super) are circley. Others, like this one from years ago, make a jalapeño. This is hard science you guys, let’s be precise. https://t.co/VTgVDzzibf

@twaller44 It doesn't describe a physical or atmospheric process, so it's left out in the cold.
@DanaFelice I am not a fan of that plan locally.
Pro-snow weather terms:		"deformation zone"	frequent mentions of the "dendritic growth zone" (impress with "DGZ")	"the low is passing south of us"		Anti-snow:		"dry slot"	"dry air monster"	"the low went north"		We cannot be close friends if you like:		"freezing rain"	"ice storm."
... current thinking is around 1" for NW Middle TN, a dusting for SE Middle TN, with us in the middle. Nevertheless, heavy (flooding?) rain Saturday + 👆drama + sub-freezing Sunday temps may = hazardous icy/driving conditions Sunday. More later on our dot com. 3/3
2/ ... but soon it'll start to accumulate, again, assuming Euro is right. The GFS model and its buddies disagree, predicting the parent low pressure center will pass north of us, giving us no one's favorite thing, the "dry slot," which is the opposite of a deformation band ...
1/3 Euro model - usually most reliable - is the outlier. It thinks a "deformation zone containing considerable snowfall" (@NWSNashville) develops late Saturday night&gt;&gt;Sunday morning, dropping snow on a warm, wet earth. Initial snow will melt ...

@MikePaul44 Finally, we have good stuff coming in 2019. Big stuff. Exciting times ahead. We’re always trying new things to get better at this. Thanks for your support. We are keeping close tabs on NWS-Nashville to be sure they’re loved and supported, respecting their rules along the way.
@MikePaul44 Also NOT meager. We can do what we do because we have so many people giving $1 or more a month. Thank you! Just got some new stuff in this week to roll out different media communication tools. Also met with interns tonight to smooth transition to more stable website design.
@MikePaul44 We aren’t using Patreon money to do that - we are very careful that it goes to what it says it’s going to - but we are part of the local weather community to make this happen already and in the future. There are NWS rules for this sort of thing that are being followed.
HRRR model update shows off and on rain tomorrow. Here it is. Grab an umbrella going out the door. https://t.co/U3UXHA1Lsa
@KathrynTarsha It was so cool. Too bad the forecast was 👎
@bobgerye Local warmup midweek, relative to the COLD coming Sunday-Monday.
@Coach_Butler24 IIRC, it wasn’t in any of the models, which were terrible compared to today. I remember seeing it develop and mature to our NW and slide in, watching on the old intellicast radar.
@rickbergen16 Not at that time.
Here's my story. I was working in Maryland Farms. Everyone got on the road at the same time. Gridlock ensued. I figured why fight it? Worked a solid day. Easiest commute home ever on vacant secondary roads, passing abandoned ditched or out of gas cars.
@lindseyfrazier Sure there's a slightest chance.
@Stephpezz15 @NWSNashville IKR! Usually snow:liquid ratio is 10:1, so 2" of rain would be 20" of snow! Thankfully snow events are much drier, OTW we'd be Canada.
@WritinginMC @NWSNashville https://t.co/MOrg2XcVz4
@Danishova Everything is worse in Atlanta.
@dchangas Biggest all time, BTW, in 24 hours: 17.0", March 17, 1892. The city took it "good naturedly." https://t.co/ue7ySSzqji
@AlexBrownTN Yeah, polar vortex etc. It gets cold in February, that's one way how it happens.
Biggest wintry concern this weekend remains that 1" to 3" of rain Saturday, wet roads, decks, steps, etc., then light snow/mix Sunday morning, with Sunday temps dropping way below freezing thanks to arctic air, converting wet walk/drive pavement into Preds Victory Surfaces. https://t.co/qP3jtUOObe
@AlexBrownTN Nah. 1" max for us. Mostly grassy areas, decks, elevated roads impacted. Stay tuned tho! Expect forecast changes. Ice my main concern.
@dchangas That Jan 2016 event hit 8" IIRC.
@AlexBrownTN What are you asking? ^al
16 years ago (continued): "The snow [began] falling around 8:00 a.m., and by mid-day the city [was] paralyzed with blocked interstates, numerous accidents, and large-scale gridlock." (2/2) ^al
If you were here 16 years ago, you likely remember this. From NWS: "On January 16, 2003...A major snowstorm strikes the mid state, with Nashville reporting 7" of snow -- much more than was forecast -- becoming the city's biggest snowfall in nearly 7 years. (1/2)

@dapoptimist What's your pod?
@jasonhawkfan Sure. In February it gets cold. February 2019 looks cold.
@Hank1st Pretty much everyone uses the same data, so yeah, but something like this -- beyond 7 days -- isn't what we do, and if we did we would leave the thesaurus in the drawer. It gets cold in February!
@KingTammie @TLee61 There's no reliable way to know for one particular spot. Often times arctic intrusions involve very dry air. Hard to snow in that.
@TLee61 We're getting Februaried.
@iamoris @NWSNashville Same place it always is.
@crazycelt60 Possible you'll see it, but does not look likely rn.

@workingonmy Maybe right at the end of the day. (Tweeted earlier this AM FYI)
@RyanMaue Set the line a C instead of F. Profit.
“...we have seen so far this winter by Monday morning, with lows dropping well down into the teens and even single digits. These readings will be some 40 to 50 degrees colder than highs on Saturday.” /end/
“...Regardless, any snow that does fall (as well as leftover rain water) is likely	to freeze onto area roadways on Sunday as temperatures drop	through the 20s during the day, which could create travel problems throughout the region. Guidance continues to show the coldest temps...
“...with highest amounts over our northwest counties where the Arctic air arrives quickest. As always, this remains **very uncertain and	subject to change**, with lesser amounts more likely if the bulk of	moisture moves out as quickly as the GFS indicates...
Update from @NWSNashville about snow potential Sat night - Sunday, after Saturday’s rain ends: “Using a blend of these models and other	guidance, a reasonable most likely scenario at this range 5 days	out is for anywhere from a dusting up to 1 inch of snow...
36° now, high 41°. Clouds should eventually break up today. Until then, more blerg.
@VU_All_Access IDK why they even have snow depth (assuming that’s what it is), has so little value. But agree that would be 👀
If I could design a sleddable snow system, this wouldn’t be it
“A wintry mix of precipitation will	then be possible Saturday night into Sunday. As of this time, uncertainties remain concerning any wintry accumulations amounts.” 		If I could design a sleddable snow system, this wouldn’t be it. More about this tomorrow.
Hazardous Weather Outlook from @NWSNashville: “A strong storm system could bring locally moderate to heavy rainfall to much of Middle Tennessee Friday night and Saturday, 	which could result in minor flooding issues, especially on area creeks and streams...
@mattcolleran1 Probably raining.
NWS highlighting the possibility of freezing fog overnight into the morning hours tomorrow. This is when fog forms while surface temps are below freezing, creating a tricky glaze of ice. Take it easy on bridges and overpasses. ^al

@TJ_099 We do not peddle False Hope.
Euro ensemble update thinks probability of snowfall accumulating more than 1" Sunday is 8%. Put another way, probability of less than 1" or nothing is 92%. Even if* snow falls, melting likely, ground gonna be wet and warm.		*denotes "if," conveying uncertainty https://t.co/fPCMMubGP6
@SuzKincaid I wish I had brought my slippers to work.
@ClivePickles @WilhiteWx @BobWx08 If it tracks right overhead we'll have less snow. We want it south of us to get more snow. That's why we wrote what we did in the blog this morning. For Indiana, it's far enough south to raise forecast confidence. For us not so much.
@WanderingAZ I would consider a seat inside that fireplace.
@MitchellDespot @wunderground @TomNiziol @mikebettes @TWCAlexWilson @weatherchannel LOL, Euro did the same thing a few weeks ago. Result: squadoosh.

@Delish_Paleoish Also a lot of it is about whether it happens all at once or not.

@Carmen_Klapper It's all engineering!
@HaydenAdams15 @wcsDirofSchools No chance.
There's still drizzle out there, and temps will be near freezing tonight with fog possible in the morning. Be wary of roads where fog has settled, especially bridges and overpasses, because a thin layer of ice might have formed.

@ponytailshawtyy I think he runs out of magic today. But if they beat NO watch out.
Unfortunately, weather is full of crap apps making 45 day forecasts that are like Super Bowl score predictions made during the middle of the quarterfinal round. Hot garbage. 2/2
“Will it snow here this winter” is like asking some sports talk yakker the teams &amp; final score of the Super Bowl in the middle of divisional playoffs. Best we can do is say “hard to bet against Tom Brady,” but then there’s Mahomes, Rivers, Brees, etc. 1/2
@hollifc Correct.
@13pape We can’t predicts 5 days away with any reasonable accuracy so beyond that is ????. But usually we have snow.

@SonnyPittman We also saw no crickets.
Temps hovering in mid/upper 30°s now. Precip light and occasional overnight. Surface temps expected to remain above freezing, but be careful on bridges, overpasses, and at elevation just in case.

@thomputnam Free Sonic ice
Area personal wx stations hovering around 35-36°. BNA is at 37°. Take it easy on bridges/overpasses if you're driving overnight or early in the AM. While NWS isn't expecting temps below freezing, don't test the limits of your traction tonight. If anything, they'll be wet. ^al

@ElizabethNoll Oh snap. We'll send him right down. ^al
@gary_tenn Yep! ^al
@inbredpoet Explain. Meaning there's ice falling from the sky? Roads are icy? ^al
@heymistahdj NWS does not believe so. ^al
NWS believes the sleet will transition over to all rain as the atmosphere aloft will grow less favorable for sleet development as the precip continues on.  ^al
@projpatsummitt @justinbbradford When the D.A.M. eats, the air around him cool. Hence the sleet. Also never said he’d eat all of it.
As the atmosphere deals with the aforementioned dry layer above our heads, precip type will switch back and forth from sleet to rain and a mixture between the two. Air temps well above freezing. ^al
@Loberd3 This is a good start. https://t.co/qPsMjyfJpx ^al
@Java_Nick @NWSNashville Can we get a pic? How much accumulation? ^wm

@lukejhill The D.A.M. comes and goes as it wants to. We've tried to control it, and have failed. It's a formidable opponent. ^al
@justinbbradford Yeah, some dry air aloft is causing some sleet down here. No probs expected. ^al
@PennyRoo It's sleet. Both ice, but form in very different environments. Thanks for the report! ^al
@jaspercjones May get a break in the rain, but it'll be cold. ^al
@AirborneGeek Absolutely. I plan to stay down here. ^al
This next incoming round of precip looks like it'll carry some sleet with it just like the round earlier. It's caused by this incredibly dry layer of air off the surface. No worries. ^al https://t.co/rT9tMMKpO2

Despite some sleet, the panic meter is on zero, and only briefly goes to 1 if you shake it a bit. Evaporative cooling is happening aloft, but surface temps should remain above freezing so no travel impacts expected. We're watching, but excitement expectations are yawningly low. https://t.co/Xc0DM5ZuVi
@fuzzyL0G1C Doesn't bother me, my life is spent (a) sleeping or (b) in traffic.
Precip working in with very cold temps aloft, so you may see sleet try to sneak through. Dry Air Monster gobbling most of this up, so unclear how much precip will reach earth. Anything that does will meet above-freezing temps. Ground temps well over 40F. Splat, melt. https://t.co/prXzqiCe3J

@nick_gw_ No opinion on Virginia
High today 46°. Rain tonight, maybe a sprinkle shortly after dark, but heavier rain ETA 9-10 PM. Not expecting snow or wintry precip probs, but that’ll be close (in KY) and closely watched. HRRR model: https://t.co/13uOmcwuWN
@justinseeley Not every winter we didn’t.
@mish43 I’m not forecasting for Evansville
@JLCastleman It’ll be fine
@justinseeley It’s really cold! Feels wintry! Snowfall tho, who knows? Not unusual for us to get mostly snowless winters.
Meanwhile, Euro thinks the precip arrives here around midnight but doesn’t do much...and the real rain arrives late Saturday.
HRRR model now thinks light rain will start as early as 6 PM Friday, lasting until around midnight or so, falling as a cold rain. Wintry mess to our N and NW tho. https://t.co/i20ZNbiCJi
@gentrys01 The red guy looks unready for a cold rain.
@6SenseofHumor @CumberlandWx Anthony runs that account well.
HRRR model👇🏼at midnight Friday night. That’s rain, with ETA around midnight. (Euro model thinks Friday 10 PM precip onset, maybe a mix but mostly rain). Still think this’ll be a rain event, but stay connected, changes possible. https://t.co/9RMGLCDVc3
@Kellymweymouth Slowly getting longer and more tolerable
Once played @FatherSonBowl in the snow in early February (BTW you can sign up for that here, it's fun https://t.co/jrALJCwyyH). Will it snow before then? EPS model through 1/26 thinks 1" snow will fall total, whether it'd stick to anything who knows. Avg seasonal snowfall ~ 6".
Then low chance of a rain/snow mix late Sat night into Sunday morning, but again, this is expected to be rain.		Accumulation is not forecast for us, have to go closer to KY for a better chance of that. 		For us, a cold rain most likely. "Models are trending warmer," says NWS. 2/2
Media @NWSNashville conference call about tomorrow ongoing now for Friday - Sunday. 		Rain begins late Friday afternoon/evening, possibly but unlikely changing to a rain/snow mix until sunrise Saturday, then only rain during the daylight hours Saturday. 1/2
@615Dave Now all we need is snow!
@JeffSojka @NWSNashville Possible but unlikely.
@rebeccacherman @NWSNashville I agree. Cold rain is the worst.
Looks more and more like a cold rain instead of snow Friday night through Sunday morning. (Even if snow, it would melt after sunrise Saturday and Sunday). Forecast graphic from @NWSNashville: https://t.co/kkH8od8D17
@elaine_peake I’m going to try turning it off and on. To see if that works.
@shelbyburon @NWSNashville Nope

@JoeCarmack @NWSNashville Basically that TWC tweet was one run of the Euro from a few days ago, passed off like a forecast. Other models were way different, Euro now too way different, which is why posting deterministic model runs based on one model is 🤦‍♀️
@JoeCarmack @NWSNashville It’s a bad forecast for us, that’s for sure.
20% probability of it even snowing Friday night/Saturday AM or late Saturday night/Sunday morning (left) with nothing accumulating here (right), almost comically. Cue #SnowDome tweets! Latest data from @NWSNashville. Who loves a cold rain? (Nobody!) (stay connected y’all) https://t.co/RknF8YLN4r
@Nashvlkitn Tomorrow night. Don’t sell your tickets. I think you’ll use them.

@cigarfloyd @NWSNashville Because it's unclear whether we will dip below freezing (ie BNA low is 35° Sat AM) and the dewpoint minimum is 32° so we could wet bulb to freezing. Also precip-type is determined by temps aloft and Euro thinks temps at 5K feet will dip under 0°C. Rain still most likely p-type.

@bobgerye Longtime subscriber!
@travhaney Yes, I do. (My reply also satiated an old grievance of mine, which we can discuss later and off line, should your curiosity require it.)
@Wiznardo Gusting over 30 MPH.

@Reavis38 @TnTurfAssoc You may find this interesting. https://t.co/Qg7HABYLpN Not sure how valuable uncalibrated pressure data from your phone is, but I'll take any data I can get from an undersampled nation.
@twaller44 @NWSNashville I've always marveled at this particular conspiracy theory. If shelves were overstocked - proof of coordination - the theory would be leggy. But they always run out of food!
@HeatherLose @NWSNashville It illustrates the need for NWS syntax to play nice. They're tired of shouting at us but that's the system.
@OldManEasy @NWSNashville Thanks pops.
@WolfpackBrad LOL. I feel like he needs to write a Social Development Dance type song about a storm or something.
@Reavis38 @TnTurfAssoc @RadarScope Excellent and YES! Finished the talk and everyone ran to lunch, was unsure if I landed the plane on anyone's runway.
@heddajo https://t.co/wqC6PFfoEs
It may be 70° rn at BNA, but the winds are Northwest (aka cold) and it's 61° at Ft. Campbell. Enjoy spring, it'll be gone in a few hours.
@PatrickMLeeson Yup. My biggest gripe is that's a pre-sunrise potential, and nothing would stick. Yet we call it "weekend snow."
Technical discussion from @NWSNashville about rain/mix drama Friday night/Saturday AM illustrates the need for forecast nuance, reasoning, and explanation, thinking critically about all data, instead of just posting a dramatic snowmap, as if we behold the future with certainty. https://t.co/N81Jop8r7L
@BradMcCarty Ride before dark and you should enjoy it. After that, no guarantees.
Cold front cruising closer, tho. The brrrrr will be here tonight. https://t.co/SCHPh4mLoy
We've hit 71° officially, breaking record of warmest January 8 on record (70° in 2008). And there's still time for us to make it to room temp.
@yourproblemok Ehhhh, maybe. Euro model drapes the wintry mix line along I-40, with snow north in KY and rain south. GFS has it too warm to snow here. NWS-Nashville doesn't even have snow outlooked in their forecast grids. There's a lot we don't know. All models agree, though, Sat AM melting.
@kylebrogdon @travhaney / Looks at standings. Remembers Hue. /		 Nope. I meant Bengals.
@DanielH_09 That tweet is exactly like reporting on last night’s national championship game by showing one of the Alabama touchdowns

Cold Front Arrives Late; Very Cold End of the Week; Rain - Not Wintry Mix - Most Likely Friday Night thru Saturday. https://t.co/NrFUFELa0s
@jeffbatts @PanicCatfish Sure. Snow usually arrives later in the winter.
57° now, high 64°; maybe a brief windshield wetting sprinkler today, with sunshine breaking thru at times. No umbrella needed. Windy today and tomorrow, much colder tonight, low 34° tomorrow morning with wind chills in the 20°s.
@flyingsaab Maybe a few flakes late Friday night but probably nothing sticking or of any real impact. Doesn’t look like a snow event.
Tue 1/8 - Morning Sprinkles Gone By Afternoon. Cold Temps Arriving Late - Early Morning 53°, High 62° - Details Here: https://t.co/nBMtQxREsV
@kahalafarrow https://t.co/QTTsALyyJF
Wind shift tomorrow afternoon. By evening, wind chills will drop into the 30°s, beginning a cold rest-of-the-week.
@bonjovigirl1972 That depends on the type of weather, the length of the forecast, and the time of year. The better practice is to look at them all, and try to find consensus. I usually lean toward HRRR 18-36 hours out, then the Euro after that. But look at all the data. No model is great.

This line is going to show up in the 2 PM - 3 PM hour. No, I don't recommend you drive in it. Rain will be torrential, the wind worse. Don't even attempt an umbrella - you'll want to be inside anyway. So far no tornado warnings, so good news on that.
Winds 76 MPH at 2,400 feet just ahead of the line in Centerville, via TBNA radar data. Line has teeth, for sure, damaging straight-line winds the main concern. Images from 143 and 146 PM https://t.co/8uGFygUTUn
@cheesuscrust_23 Ok. Just confused us there for a second. ^wm
@cheesuscrust_23 Why did you post it right now? ^wm
Summary of Severe Thunderstorm Warnings, with the radar data turned off, at 1:42 PM. https://t.co/RAiMP9JgPP
@cheesuscrust_23 Who took this? ^wm
@1geepa ask me when it's over.
@dmsimpkins wait.
@joefowler73 Not so far.
@maurahomerski You will for sure, coming from the right side of your car.
@erinmills0812 I would.
Western Williamson County under Significant Weather Advisory until 2:15 PM for thunderstorm winds 50-55 MPH. This includes Fairview. https://t.co/nLfKAlXudk
ETAs for the storm line approaching. Radar 1:36pm ^al https://t.co/NUJbCtKO3R
Severe Thunderstorm Warnings coming out all along the line. We may be included later. Note the Severe Thunderstorm Warnings do not rule out tornadoes (warning text reminds us tornadoes remain possible). https://t.co/I9WbHH9yhO
@p_b_tucker See multiple prior (and future) tweets.
@wurstc south before the storms, west during.
NW &amp; W Davidson County covered by Significant Weather Advisory just issued for 50-55 MPH winds embedded in the line. Includes Joelton, Fontanel, Bells Bend, Riverwalk, and most of Bellevue. "Storm may intensify," stay connected. https://t.co/RxXm6c2rEP
@JonDMeade Now.
Storm line should be here before, or around, 3 PM. I think most of us  will get this line during the 2-3 PM hour. Damaging straight-line winds  main issue, they'll race through at 45-55 MPH, hopefully with nothing  else in it (like a tornado). Image from 117 PM. https://t.co/J72dT7Q7kO
@cjschooler Yup. @MaurySevereWx
@margaretakyser No.
@CaitieAndreen 5% within 25 miles of you.
@ChaddieT No.
Don't forget the most likely form of severe weather with this line is straight-line winds 60 MPH or stronger.
We're clouded over, thankfully, as this limits storm fueling instability. Here's the view from space, your federal tax dollars at work: https://t.co/PsJFJEc98V
@Crackerjen 55 MPH and no, there is only one big line and it's that second one.
@ReedTimmerAccu @tempestchasing @accuweather Hit us up on DM if you need anything.
@MikeEld58202351 Hit us up tomorrow and we will hook you up.
Lightning near Savannah indicates storm line has some teeth. Image from 1259 PM. https://t.co/FnpyqkeJbH
@ichrisbarrett Oh man. Too bad. Dreams dashed! lol
I think this line is going to show up before 3 PM, y'all. Right now hard to say how "bad" it looks because right now, radar can only see the very top of the part of the storm line that's going to come through, so, in other words, radar hasn't yet seen if it has any teeth.
@ichrisbarrett You could find out using the tools at https://t.co/oPvXtDIr73. ^wm
@ichrisbarrett Is this a game show? (I don't know, that's a more difficult question requiring time-intensive database research, time I don't have right now)
The record is 76° in 1951. It's only 68° now so I don't think we have a shot at it. https://t.co/TrghQUggCf
@leeshandphotog Go now, or wait it out.
While we have a minute, a few points. Squall line tornadoes are usually weak but can be strong/dangerous. Treat any warning with healthy respect. Also they're often short lived and can be hard to see on radar. Warning time may be brief. And this line will move FAST.
Line has prompted a tornado warning in KY. No such warnings in Tennessee right now. Image from 12:35 PM, warning was issued at 12:37 PM. https://t.co/5HVy07RLL9
If you see a tree down or God forbid, a funnel cloud or tornado, safely take a photo and/or description with your location and report it to @NWSNashville by using the #tSpotter hashtag. Help them help you and the community as a whole.
@Cd26852C It's not.
no tornado warnings, plural. https://t.co/kVVqdDVZEU
So now we look for "kinks" along the line, where tornadoes usually form. At 12:23 PM no tornado warning are in Middle TN, and we're getting a local shower, which will help dampen storm-making instability, but this line should strengthen a bit as it approaches. 👓 https://t.co/Xc5m6LuuqW
This should read 7 PM.
@tempestchasing Awww shucks, shuuuug
@LaBaPete Not sure what "reasonably safe means." Certainly, winds blowing pretty hard and will continue to do so until after this line passes. Also storms may arrive before 3 PM.
@tempestchasing Have we met? lol
@hellojennross She hears it one time then never forgets.
This is expected to rise another 5 feet to 34.5 feet later today. Monitor it here: https://t.co/M794qmg9Xn https://t.co/kMHlpZ6N0u
Tornado Watch Until 7 PM. ETAs &amp; Probabilities here &gt;&gt;&gt; https://t.co/AhW8CsX9Nw
@pvault2 What am I looking at here? ^wm
No tornado concerns with the rain currently moving through. Tornado concern is for line out west, where a tornado or two could spin up. ETA remains 3 PM or so. Radar from 11:53 AM. https://t.co/Fww7J612S2
@charltonwalker1 Second two. Not panic
Tornado Watch until 6 PM. When the details/probabilities download, we will post them. https://t.co/Z5lWEVVbc9
Dear Siri,		999 times out of 1000 I mean “tornado” not “20 now.” Also stop auto-capitalizing May, I’m usually not talking about the month.
Just Issued by NWS: Tornado Watch for Davidson and Williamson County until 7:00pm CST.
@cipearman Yeah we’ve tweeted at him already this morning. Reed used to be everywhere, now he’s EVERYWHERE.
Storm Prediction Center says there’s a 60% chance they will issue a Tornado Watch for counties to our west; if issued, Watch may include us. They expect the storm line to gradually, slowly intensify as it moves east. ETA here 3-5 PM. https://t.co/b6oDQk12Ru
Rain to depart by 8-10 PM for those along and west of I-65, 10 PM to midnight for those east of I-65. https://t.co/XMZ8skpH7m
Storm line ETA still 3-5 PM per @NWSNashville 11 AM weather briefing. Few weather models have it coming closer to 3 PM than 5 PM. Stay connected. https://t.co/xHhNcp2qlE
Stones River is now up, has a Flood Advisory, near Donelson. Monitor local rivers and creeks here: https://t.co/M794qmg9Xn https://t.co/glnxFdV07n
Storm line crossed Memphis. Radar from 10:51 AM. ETA about 3 PM, but may adjust that earlier. Conference call coming up with @NWSNashville at 11 AM, will update with any new info. https://t.co/afdd40KcEk
@tempestchasing @ReedTimmerAccu @accuweather Be careful, Reed, and note the elevation is highest near Fairview on the west side of 840.
Winds already gusting to 29 MPH at BNA. This should increase this afternoon, possibly blowing down any sick or shallow rooted trees. If your car is parked on the street, stick a stethoscope on any trees nearby and determine their fitness to stand. https://t.co/fGmL1IjGNu
@iluvherbie See previous tweets.
Storms this afternoon "will be capable of producing hourly totals as high as 1.5" which may induce localized flash flooding." -- Weather Prediction Center https://t.co/GRmIvKdRv4
We got enough rain overnight that rainfall rates between 0.6" to 1" this afternoon may lead to flash flooding in metro, especially east of I-65. Williamson County is able to handle heavier rain before flooding. Turn around, don't drown. https://t.co/FAMTSFvyxo
@MF121032 My guess is it'll be past 65 by then but we must respect the limitations of our ability to time these out.
@MF121032 There's no such thing as a definite estimated time of arrival.
A little rain coming through over the next hour, no worries with it. ETA for the strong, possibly severe, storm line remains 3 PM or so, plus or minus a few hours.
@BeccaLeep A test Periscope 100% because, well, he's on top of it.
@Java_Nick Yeah, the CWG did a story on that. I'll be shocked if an EF3 can squeeze out today.

@velocitygirl We roll over and sleep more. ^wm
@vickyreddish Things seem to be getting warmer. ^wm
@BeccaLeep 5 ^wm
The Cumberland River at Nashville is up. It will rise above action stage this afternoon and stay there tonight and tomorrow. It's already at 29' and has flooded recreation areas on both sides of the river. It's one foot away from the grass at Riverfront Landing. Addtl Details: https://t.co/hI4SiJ1Q6Z
HRRR model has a 3-4 PM ETA for strongest storms. https://t.co/6lqrlk7itp
Storm Prediction Center update this morning removed the hail risk this afternoon. Probability of damaging winds (15%) and tornado (5%) within 25 miles of you later today remains. The Wind Advisory, for gusts up to 45 MPH, is for winds independent of any storm.
Another .75” of rain expected this afternoon. Rain should clear out in time for NYE parties tonight, but again, check back frequently for ETA updates and forecast changes. High 70°, 57° by 9 PM, 50° at midnight.
Severe weather in the form of damaging winds, with a lesser threat of a tornado, is possible as storms arrive this afternoon. ETA 3-5 PM. Stay connected for updates and timing changes. https://t.co/TqL7nblkH3
Good morning! 2018 is going out with a weather day.		A Wind Advisory is in effect from 9 AM to 6 PM, gusts up to 45 MPH. https://t.co/MO1EYI6inE
@FigLeeLee If anything happens about 40 alarms go off and we are up.
New Storm Prediction Center probabilities for “x” happening within 25 miles of us tomorrow afternoon:		Damaging straight-line winds: 15%	Tornado: 5%	Hail: 5%		ETA 3-5 PM Monday, stay connected for ETA changes because timing may change. https://t.co/UmItrKi68F
Moderate/heavy rainfall expected over next 3-5 hours. Maybe few rumbles of thunder but no severe weather expected while we sleep. https://t.co/wxo0QfG84F
@TerriWork314 I assumed you were tweeting responsibly!
@TerriWork314 We aren’t always right but I’d like to think we’re good alternative to crap apps
@lil_lost Excellent! Thanks!
@TerriWork314 CrapApps strike again! Sorry.
Now that the game is over, I'm going to bed. Expect heavy rain over the next several hours. If anything is issued, we'll tweet it. Be smart if you're out late and you see a water covered road, turn around, it's not worth it. Another storm day tomorrow. Will be up early.
@Busymom This incoming heavy rain will only add to the indignity of it all.
Weather going to nose dive fast downtown as very heavy rain nears....no lightning detected or expected, but this is Heavy Rain, y'all. Radar 10:22 PM. https://t.co/q1PC8WLZke
@nolandtn Suede shoed fans surely out now.
@lukejhill One of the best pressers all time.
Those downtown face a LOT of rain arriving around 10:30 PM. Driving will be difficult and you'll get soaked if you're not ready for it. Radar from 10:08 PM. https://t.co/AjBvpFYwxs
