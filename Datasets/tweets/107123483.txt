Thank you to @WDET and @CivicCenterTV for the live coverage of my State of the County Address. #SOTC13 #Brooks
Thank you to everyone who helped make tonight’s State of the County as successful as it could be! #SOTC13 #Brooks
Thank you so much, ladies and gentlemen for your support. #SOTC13 #OaklandCounty #Brooks
I’d like to thank the Board of Trustees, the administration &amp; staff of @DCDSNews for their hospitality tonight. #SOTC13 #OaklandCounty
When I’m talking about prayers, let’s not forget my driver, a very close friend to many of us in this room, Jim Cram #SOTC13 #OaklandCounty
Thank you for prayers, friendship, support &amp; for the confidence to give me another 4 years to lead the greatest county in America. #SOTC13
He said: “Brooks, with all our experience &amp; skill we could only get you to the five yard line. Prayer got you the rest of the way.” #SOTC13
I went to the meeting to thank the surgeons for their skill in putting me back together and sending me back to my family. #SOTC13
But I will make you this pledge tonight: at next year’s State of the County address, I will walk in here and stand at the podium. #SOTC13
I'm in PT three times a week &amp; water therapy on Saturdays. It’s a busy schedule of rehab. I've also resumed a full work schedule. #SOTC13
The road to recovery has been a challenge. Frankly, I had hoped to be a little farther down that road than I am at present. #SOTC13
My injuries were many; no need to detail them here tonight. #SOTC13 #OaklandCounty
The love for your family, and of your family, trumps everything else. #SOTC13 #OaklandCounty
Jerry couldn't be here tonight. He made a decision that I now fully understand having been through such a dangerous time in my life. #SOTC13
But truly, it's Jerry’s leadership &amp; leadership of deputies &amp; directors that #OaklandCounty gov't operations continued seamlessly. #SOTC13
Media credited my #Leadership that I put in place the right team that enabled county operations to continue without interruption. #SOTC13
I would like to take a moment to thank my team &amp; Chief DEP Exec Jerry Poisson, who in my absence, took helm of #OaklandCounty. #SOTC13
Finally tonight, I want to update you on a more personal matter – how I am doing since the August 10th crash. #SOTC13 #OaklandCounty
“The @brooksieway Minigrant Program” has redistributed $95,000 back to the community &amp; local health programs in memory of my son. #SOTC13
We have supported 5k races at schools &amp; churches; swim classes for challenged children; dance lessons for senior citizens, etc. #SOTC13
The "minigrant program" was created to help communities across #OaklandCounty to sponsor events which support healthy living. #SOTC13
The net proceeds from @brooksieway go to “The Brooksie Way Minigrant Program”. #SOTC13 #OaklandCounty
#QualityofLife #OaklandCounty #SOTC13 http://t.co/KbDfBPjz
This will be the 6th year for @thebrooksieway, which has become very popular, receiving national attention in running magazines. #SOTC13
In the aftermath of my son’s death, a committee formed @thebrooksieway to celebrate his life with a half marathon and 10k. #SOTC13
Our future will be shaped by these young entrepreneurs so we want to find them now &amp; support the development of their talents. #SOTC13
@EricaCoulston1, who introduced me here tonight at the #SOTC13, was elected by popular vote from among the three finalists. #OaklandCounty
The #Elite40 had a prenominal success. This year, the committee honed 365 applications down to the “Top 40” #SOTC13 #OaklandCounty
The #Elite40, created last year, recognizes young #Entrepreneurs as up-and-coming leaders within our community. #SOTC13 #OaklandCounty
@ArtsBeatsEats is now one of the most recognized festivals in America, attracting close to 400,000 people to #RoyalOak. #SOTC13
Events such as @ArtsBeatsEats, @QuakeOnTheLake, @RochesterDDA's Fire &amp; Ice, #Elite40, #MI Great Artist &amp; @brooksieway #SOTC13
Given all the attention to demands of the job, I still had time to create and launch  “quality of life events.” #SOTC13 #OaklandCounty
We expanded the #Health Department to place us ahead of the curve on potential pandemics &amp; other health challenges. #SOTC13 #OaklandCounty
We were recognized again by the Center for #Digital #Government as the Most Digitally Advanced County in America. #SOTC13 #OaklandCounty
We focused on IT, looking to become the best in the nation – and we are. #SOTC13 #OaklandCounty
We built an #EconomicDevelopment team-I'd say the best in state-to attract new #Business while holding on to existing businesses. #SOTC13
My goal early on was to streamline #OaklandCounty government making it more cost effective, more efficient, and more pro-business. #SOTC13
I'd like to recognize Dave VanderVeen, Judy Cunningham, Nancy Scarlet, Tom Eaton, Karen Jones and Jennifer Hain #SOTC13 #OaklandCounty
I’d like to recognize some of them for their steadfast support of #OaklandCounty and the quality of their job performance. #SOTC13
#OaklandCounty and many of our employees have received recognition both large and small. #SOTC13
I'd like to recognize departments rarely in spotlight: office of Corporate Counsel, Animal Control &amp; the Medical Examiner's office. #SOTC13
I have no problem taking #OaklandCounty against cities across the country-It's an increased level of competition but we’re up to it #SOTC13
#OaklandCounty was the only county government to receive the Champions of Change recognition – the rest were cities. #SOTC13
The @whitehouse said the Champions of Change award "showcase the amazing movement of innovation in government across America". #SOTC13
We're expanding the cloud even more. It has proven to be a successful delivery mechanism for shared services among #Governments. #SOTC13
#OaklandCounty partnered with the National Association of Counties to create a cloud software library for use around the nation. #SOTC13
G2G Cloud Solutions will make available leading edge software programs to other government units. #SOTC13
#OaklandCounty is improving the delivery of county services, reducing costs &amp; producing a revenue stream with cloud computing. #SOTC13
I want to thank all of you publicly tonight for your continued support of our #Budget goals. #SOTC13 #OaklandCounty
We achieved these budget milestones because we had incredible cooperation from elected officials here in #OaklandCounty. #SOTC13
Communities across the United States are still studying how we paid off our “legacy costs”. #SOTC13 #OaklandCounty
You must have deduced that #OaklandCounty must be in balance for 2013, 2014, and 2015.  We are – and we’re now tinkering with 2016. #SOTC13
Multi-year balanced budget means, in #OaklandCounty’s case, a three-year rolling budget in balance for 36 months. #SOTC13 #OaklandCounty
We've achieved multi-year balanced budgets while maintaining the lowest effective operating millage in the state. #SOTC13 #OaklandCounty
Governments across the United States study #OaklandCounty’s budget practices which have earned us a solid AAA bond rating. #SOTC13
With the help of my solid staff, we have made #OaklandCounty the poster child for budgeting in tough times. #SOTC13
We didn’t reach such huge savings by accident. It's because of skill, knowledge &amp; talent of my management &amp; budget team. #SOTC13
In 2007, #OaklandCounty became the first county in America to fully fund the retirement #HealthCare debt. #SOTC13
The experience &amp; innovation of my budget team is directly responsible for #OaklandCounty taxpayers saving over $100Mill this year. #SOTC13
Oxford Schools currently have more students learning Mandarin Chinese language than the rest of the school districts in #MI combined #SOTC13
Oxford Community now has 11 sister schools in China; operates one itn'l high school &amp; will be opening a second school this fall. #SOTC13
Oxford Community Schools embraced my call for Mandarin language and culture instruction and they’ve taken it to the next level. #SOTC13
One of our China-related success stories is on the very northern reaches of #OaklandCounty. #SOTC13
Alan attended the 2012 @AIAG forum - a gathering of 500 auto suppliers from China and around the world. #SOTC13
Sr Business Development Rep. Alan Weber joined @DetroitChamber, @AutomationAlley &amp; @MillerCanfield for a week-long trip to China. #SOTC13
Three Chinese delegations scheduled meetings here with #OaklandCounty officials as a result of Matt's trip. #SOTC13
Deputy Matt Gibb spent 10 days in China with Gov. Snyder in Sept. &amp; met with more than 20 #LifeScience &amp; automotive companies.  #SOTC13
Representatives from my Economic Development team took two trips to China this past fall which yielded great opportunities #SOTC13
There are 33 Chinese firms operating in #OaklandCounty; 28 public school districts offer Mandarin language and/or language courses. #SOTC13
#OaklandCounty has an impressive case to make for increased Chinese investment; 25% of the 44,500 Chinese residents in #MI live here #SOTC13
It is estimated that China will overtake the U.S. as the world’s largest economy by 2016. #SOTC13 #OaklandCounty
I am pleased to announce http://t.co/bb9hFLjP, a website to connect those applying for training in the skilled trades in our region. #SOTC13
Although #Knowledge based economy is the new reality, we should not overlook the opportunity for high-paying jobs in skilled trades. #SOTC13
My #Workforce Development Division has several programs to meet the demand for a skilled, knowledgeable &amp; technical workforce. #SOTC13
We are attacking the future #Workforce issue aggressively. #SOTC13 #OaklandCounty
The challenge for #OaklandCounty is to create &amp; maintain a skilled &amp; educated workforce that'll attract &amp; keep companies here. #SOTC13
The future for #OaklandCounty, and for that matter, America, will be our active participation in the knowledge-based economy. #SOTC13
I believe #OaklandCounty is building a strong foundation for diversification within the knowledge-based economy. #SOTC13
It's clear that #OaklandCounty is succeeding at attracting companies from emerging sectors around the country &amp; around the globe. #SOTC13
"The measure of success is not whether you have a tough problem to deal with, but whether it's the same problem you had last year.” #SOTC13
…Those 35 companies and projects seeded by @AutomationAlley have been awarded $69 million in other investments. #SOTC13 #OaklandCounty
@AutomationAlley has invested $8 million in 35 companies and projects that have resulted in 600 jobs on its own. #SOTC13 #OaklandCounty
Since its inception, the Alley has conducted 16 #Trade missions, garnering $201 million contracts, creating more than 1,000 jobs. #SOTC13
Thirty foreign companies have had a “soft landing” in @AutomationAlley's #International Center since 2011. #SOTC13 #OaklandCounty
@AutomationAlley was honored by Presidents George W. Bush &amp; @BarackObama for its role in creating jobs in the U.S. #SOTC13 #OaklandCounty
@AutomationAlley is a 1,000 member organization, making it the largest high-tech #Business consortium in the Midwest. #SOTC13 #OaklandCounty
...That all adds up to 7,000 new scientists and engineers graduating from our colleges and universities each year! #SOTC13 #OaklandCounty
Our region ranks first in the number of engineering and #Technology degrees completed at colleges &amp; universities in our area. #SOTC13
The @AutomationAlley region has 300,000 #Technology workers. #SOTC13 #OaklandCounty
@AutomationAlley now markets an 8 county region of S.E. #MI as a hub of #Innovation in engineering, advanced manufacturing research. #SOTC13
#INNOVENTION 2013 is scheduled for Nov. 6-8 at the Troy @Marriott. Buy your tickets before this one sells out: http://t.co/o318ju8D #SOTC13
From @MedicalMainSt's #INNOVENTION conference, we developed six #Business leads that we are currently pursuing. #SOTC13 #OaklandCounty
Sometimes the simplest ideas are the most #Innovative ones. #SOTC13 #OaklandCounty
Great turnout at #SOTC13 #OaklandCounty http://t.co/IahsWgud
The @MedicalMainSt #INNOVENTION conference brought engineers &amp; designers from #MedicalDevice manufacturers together with doctors. #SOTC13
This past autumn, @MedicalMainSt debuted before an international audience with #OaklandCounty’s first @INNOVENTION conference. #SOTC13
Professionals in the medical field, leading-edge life science researchers &amp; top-notch #MedicalDevice manufacturers #SOTC13 #OaklandCounty
That's what the @MedicalMainSt initiative is all about-letting the world know that #OaklandCounty can lay claim to best-of-class. #SOTC13
It is clear from these numbers that #OaklandCounty has become a destination for world-class #HealthCare. #SOTC13
Of #OaklandCounty’s 25 largest employers, one quarter are hospitals. #SOTC13
32 #HealthCare &amp; #LifeScience companies have invested $850mill in #OaklandCounty creating 4,800 jobs, retaining 1,400.  #SOTC13
To put that in perspective, that's more than the @ClevelandClinic and @MayoClinic combined. #SOTC13 #OaklandCounty
100,000+ individuals are employed in #HealthCare, #LifeScience research &amp; #MedicalDevice manufacturing right here in #OaklandCounty. #SOTC13
#OaklandCounty #SOTC13 http://t.co/BzgmSqxN
This $2 bill of investment &amp; 27,000 jobs have all been created during the deepest, longest recession since the Great Depression! #SOTC13
$2 bill of new investment in nine years is a milestone. It represents a lot of hard work by my #EconomicDevelopment team. #SOTC13
Since it's inception in 2004, 225 companies have invested $2 bill in #OaklandCounty, creating 27,000 jobs &amp; retaining 12,600. #SOTC13
In 2012, 37 #EmergingSectors companies invested $156 mill in #OaklandCounty, created 1,700 new jobs &amp; retaining 3,400 existing jobs. #SOCT13
My Economic Development &amp; Community Affairs team work hard to attract #Innovative, sustainable &amp; high-paying jobs to #OaklandCounty. #SOTC13
By now, you may be familiar with my #EmergingSectors initiative led by DEP Matt Gibb, Dir. @IreneSpa &amp; DEP Director Dan Hunter #SOTC13
Last year, it was predicted that #OaklandCounty would create 11,000 #Jobs. We eclipsed that prediction with 25,000 new jobs. #SOTC13
The #Business Finance Corp is on pace to close 40 loans by the end of the year. #SOTC13 #OaklandCounty
By comparison, last year, it approved $8.9 mill in loans for 10 projects in the same timeframe. #SOTC13 #OaklandCounty
The #OaklandCounty #BusinessFinance Corp approved $18.9 mill in loans for 13 business projects in first quarter of fiscal 2013. #SOTC13
And the good news continues. #SOTC3 #OaklandCounty
Residential property values will rise 1%. While modest, I believe #OaklandCounty homeowners will welcome a positive territory shift. #SOTC13
#OaklandCounty's per capita income increased 8.5% from 2010 to 2011, more than $4,100. The highest in #MI. #SOTC13
