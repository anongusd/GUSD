I am the only candidate in the race for #Florida #Governor to be endorsed by the @evtrust and, as Governor, I will continue the state’s commitment to raising the #TamiamiTrail and ensuring the #Everglades system works as intended
Raising #TamiamiTrail is vital in order to allow clean water to flow into the southern #Everglades, rather than drain from #LakeOkechobee into the #Caloosahatchee &amp; #StLucieEstuaries
I applaud @FLGovScott for his commitment to #Everglades restoration, as he announces today the completion of the 2.6-mile bridge that is part of the raising of #TamiamiTrail

When @AndrewGillum ignored requests for help from local police, the average murder rate in Tallahassee rose 52%. That is failed leadership! As Governor, I will always support our law enforcement and ensure communities in Florida have the resources they need to stay safe.
Is it ever your fault @AndrewGillum, or is it easier just to blame everyone else when things go wrong?
Florida needs a leader with integrity, not a failed mayor out for himself. #LeadersDontLie
I believe keeping Florida safe should always be a be a top priority for Governor. I will ensure our borders are secure and dangerous criminal illegal immigrants are deported. @AndrewGillum will refuse to comply with deportation orders – even for violent criminals.
My opponent wants to abolish immigration enforcement and allow sanctuary cities. I want to abolish illegal immigration and support a well-functioning skills-based legal immigration system. My plan is common sense. His plan is crazy.
I will support ICE, ban sanctuary cities, and implement E-Verify. @AndrewGillum has said he will refuse to cooperate with immigration authorities. Florida deserves a Governor who will prioritize the safety of our state and its citizens. https://t.co/DqDpW3QmAk

I believe parents make the best choices for their kids’ education. As Governor, they will be empowered. @AndrewGillum wants to end school choice scholarships for poor, minority, and disabled children in Florida who need them most. https://t.co/jfPuq1rbf6
There are 2 options for how Gillum will pay for his radical proposals:	• Increase Florida’s corporate income tax to the 2nd highest in the U.S.	• Raise the sales tax to 39% or CREATE a 37% state income tax	Every way you look at it, Floridians will pay. https://t.co/Jyo4NHToKS

How does @AndrewGillum’s plan to pay for his government takeover of health care? He would have to CREATE a state income tax of 37% or raise the sales tax to 39%. Both options mean less money in your wallet. https://t.co/9HP28L5ta5
Gillum’s health care plan is Obama’s “You can keep your doctor” all over again. Don’t listen to the lies. In Gillum’s government-takeover of health care, you have to take what the goverment gives you. I want to increase options for Floridians to choose a plan that’s best for them
I understand that a one-size-fits-all solution will not meet the diverse needs of our state. We must contain costs in order to expand access and protect the quality of our health care system. https://t.co/qD7y1tie0D
It is no surprise that @AndrewGillum refuses to admit that his Medicaid expansion plan would cost Florida’s taxpayers $564 million in new taxes. My plan is to increase access to affordable health care WITHOUT raising your taxes. https://t.co/E8HgMTTfNA
I have always fought to protect taxpayer dollars. Gillum, on the other hand, has proven that he will only look out for himself and his friends at taxpayers’ expense. FL deserve a Governor who will protect their hard-earned money, not spend it on himself. https://t.co/CfhX3v2bnh
.@AndrewGillum takes being a pay-to-play politician very seriously. Documents show he ILLEGALLY enjoyed free luxury trips to places like Costa Rica, New York City, Amelia Island, and Qatar. The bad news for Gillum? The FBI also takes pay-to-play very seriously. #LeadersDontLie
Millions of taxpayer dollars have been given by @AndrewGillum to his lobbyist travel buddies. Sure sounds like #PaytoPlay... you decide.

.@AndrewGillum says he does not know about this anti-police pledge, but this morning his "campaign suggested the need for reform led to Gillum signing the pledge." https://t.co/KCdjLABq3T #flapol
https://t.co/zMdOHh9ZXn https://t.co/mQ7nfjDrYF
As Governor, I will always stand with our brave law enforcement community. @AndrewGillum wants to defund police and thinks they have no place in our society. That’s despicable. Our state deserves a Governor who will support our law enforcement, not undermine them.
.@AndrewGillum, they are on my website. https://t.co/Q31iX1N4qU https://t.co/fWzJCx3aH3
Two years later and @AndrewGillum still can't provide the receipts for a vacation he went on with lobbyists. That makes sense though. It can be difficult to find something that doesn't exist. 😊
Hey, @AndrewGillum, what does it say about a guy whose "best friends" are part of an active FBI investigation into public corruption?
.@AndrewGillum refused to fund police and the average murder rate in Tallahassee rose 52%. The most dangerous city in FL! As Governor, I will always support our law enforcement and make sure Florida doesn’t become like Tallahassee has under @AndrewGillum.
Florida’s economy is at an all-time high. But @AndrewGillum’s disastrous economic plan of BILLIONS in new taxes would bring it to a screeching halt. We need to build on our economic success by cutting taxes and creating more jobs so Floridians have more opportunities, not less.
To pay for @AndrewGillum’s radical proposals, Florida would have to: 	• Increase Florida’s corporate income tax to the 2nd highest in the U.S. 	• Raise the sales tax to 39% or CREATE a 37% state income tax 	Every way you look at it, Floridians lose. https://t.co/Jyo4NHToKS
Gillum has no plan to pay for his government takeover of health care. In fact, he would have to CREATE a state income tax of 37% or raise the sales tax to 39%. You’ll either make WAY less money or pay WAY more for everything. This would be a DISASTER. https://t.co/9HP28L5ta5
For the people of Northwest Florida, I will be there for you. You guys are resilient, and we will rebuild after #HurricaneMichael https://t.co/EdyZ1MhCsw
.@AndrewGillum loves to ignore the fact that his Medicaid expansion for able-bodied adults would cost Florida’s taxpayers $564 million in new taxes. As Governor, I will increase access to affordable health care WITHOUT raising your taxes. https://t.co/E8HgMTTfNA
ICYMI: I was endorsed by the Everglades Trust because I am the candidate who will stand up to the special interests harming Florida. https://t.co/owNnNTkuKc
Despite what he wants you to believe, @AndrewGillum has a record of supporting projects that would wreak havoc on Florida’s environment. I stand firm in my commitment to Florida’s economy and my plan to protect our environment.
During my time in the military &amp; as a prosecutor, I always put people first. As mayor, @AndrewGillum voted to increase his own benefits and hand out tax dollars to his friends. As Governor, I’ll put the needs of Florida first every day.
And we're live!
Thanks @ScottforFlorida, we're going to make a great team! https://t.co/VnrJ71Jabc
I will head to the CNN debate stage in one hour to share my vision for Florida.  Floridians have a choice--a candidate who stands with our law enforcement or @AndrewGillum who has pledged to abandon them. https://t.co/Yps8YsKSbQ

Sheriff Mike Scott: @AndrewGillum disqualified himself as a serious candidate for Governor when he signed the Dream Defender's pledge that promises to pull funding from law enforcement &amp; prisons because, as the organization claims, “Police and prisons have no place in ‘justice.’”
Sheriff Mike Scott: “I know Ron will build on the efforts of myself and Governor Rick Scott to ensure Florida is one of the safest places in the world to raise a family, vacation, and to retire.”

I promise to only appoint judges who will uphold the Constitution and follow the law as it is written. We must secure Florida's future.
If @AndrewGillum is elected, out-of-state, radical groups would pressure him to appoint activist judges who would legislate from the bench to fit their own ideology. The consequences would be dangerous and felt for generations.
Today the FL Supreme Court ruled that the next governor will appoint 3 justices to the Supreme Court. This decision makes November even more critical for the future of our state.

I’ve fought to clean up Washington by fighting against congressional pay increases and pensions, pushing term limits for members of Congress, and making sure that our elected leaders live under the same rules as everyone else. #DeSantisforGovernor
The forgotten man and woman is the hard working American taxpayer who wakes up every day without asking government for anything in return. We are finally putting these Americans first again, and I promise to fight every day for them as Governor. #DeSantisforGovernor
As a state surrounded by beautiful beaches and waterways, our environment and our economy depends on protecting them.  I support Gov. Scott’s efforts to exempt FL from offshore drilling. #DeSantisforGovernor
I will fight every single day I bring an end to the opioid crisis that has reached all corners of Florida and the country. Both tough enforcement for the low-life trash who peddle these pills, as well as comfort and support for those fighting addiction. #DeSantisforGovernor

We must prepare students for citizenship with a renewed focus on the founding principles of our country, the Constitution, and Bill of Rights. #DeSantisforGovernor

Sanctuary cities snub their noses at federal immigration law and care more about protecting violators of law than they do their own citizens. DOJ should now do all they can to bring federal charges to ensure that justice is done for #KateSteinle’s family. 3/3
This same illegal immigrant, who had been deported five times, was able to kill #KateSteinle only after the sanctuary city of San Francisco decided to release him onto the streets in clear violation of federal law. 2/3

Those thousands of watery graves represent an unequivocal verdict on Fidel Castro: he was an evil man who brought misery to millions 13/
Why would they do this if Castro's Cuba was marked by "social progress" and "egalitarian ideals" as the media claims? 12/
They were likely to die in shark infested waters but Castro was so intolerable they were willing to risk violent death to escape 11/
Perhaps the most tragic but clarifying proof of Castro's failed rule is the tens of thousands of Cubans who perished trying to flee 10/
Compare Cuban-Americans whose families fled Castro's tyranny: you see success at the highest levels in business, govt, sports etc 9/
The proof is in the pudding: Cuba is a failed state and has seen its standard of living plummet since Castro seized power 8/
But the legacy of Fidel Castro is not complicated or mixed; he made Cuba a police state and his political program produced dismal results 7/
In a fawning obit, the NYT said Castro had a "mixed record of social progress and abject poverty" 6/
The media seems confused by this: the LA Times called him a "charismatic icon" while the WSJ said he "pursued egalitarian ideals" 5/
Castro wasn't a "leader" who "served" Cuba; he was a tyrant that ruled over Cubans by fiat 4/
Castro jailed political opponents, confiscated private property and ruined the lives of millions 3/
The hallmark of Castro's rule was repression of basic God-given rights such as the rights to speech, assembly, and worship 2/
Fidel Castro was a brutal dictator who turned the island nation of Cuba into a prison 1/
