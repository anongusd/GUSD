Meet the women changing tires and making history in @NASCAR. My story tonight for @NBCNightlyNews: https://t.co/4bf9z1XeoQ
Environmentalists see “forest management” as code words for weakening forest protections ... little more than a presidential pretext for pushing policies preferred by the logging industry.
The Trump administration – led by Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke and Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue, who oversees the U.S. Forest Service – is actively promoting forest thinning and the targeted cutting of trees as a means of preventing wildfires.
Why is Trump singularly focused on "forest management" when experts say forest thinning would not have stopped the California wildfires? He appears to be framing the debate on his terms – deemphasizing climate change while pushing one of his administration's policy goals.
Trump -- visiting a fire command post in Chico, Calif., when asked if the seeing the devastation firsthand changes his view of climate change -- says, "No. I want great climate."

What’s more, a report from the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities found that whites without a college degree are the greatest beneficiaries of the social safety net. ###
Whites make up the largest share of those receiving food stamps (36 percent) and Medicaid (43 percent). Hispanics comprise the largest ethnic group to receive Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (37 percent).
Government data show that “welfare"-- an umbrella term which can include Medicaid, Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (food stamps) and Temporary Assistance for Needy Families — benefits *other groups the most.
Here are some facts to combat the figments of West’s uninformed imagination:
His divisive rhetoric has its roots in 1970s GOP politics. It was then-candidate Ronald Reagan who introduced the public to the myth of the "welfare queen." Fictional as it was, the legend lives on -- with West amplifying remnants of the derogatory trope from the Oval Office.
Kanye West’s comments today about African Americans and welfare were as objectively false as they were dangerous in perpetuating stereotypes that position low-income blacks as the face of America’s welfare system.

Christine Blasey Ford wants the FBI to investigate her Kavanaugh allegation before she testifies, her attorney confirms to NBC - h/t @jonallendc https://t.co/OpfMKNuWBh
Trump continues to attack Democrats and the timing of the Kavanaugh allegation without impugning the accuser's reputation. It's a strategy aimed appeasing Kavanaugh's defenders *without alienating the Republicans who say Christine Blasey Ford deserves a public hearing.
Trump on Kavanaugh: "I feel so badly for him that he's going through this ... This is not a man who deserves this."
In order for the FBI to take further action on Kavanaugh, the White House would have to request it. And while the FBI wouldn’t have much to work with regarding the decades-old Ford allegation, the bureau routinely conducts background investigations when the evidence is limited. https://t.co/Hz5n4WVfvk
