So far under Trump, median family incomes have risen by more than $1,000, according to Sentier Research and based on Census Bureau numbers. These numbers are not broken down by race, but it's a pretty good bet that black incomes have risen with those of other races under Trump
From 2009 to 2015, the incomes of black Americans fell by more than $900 per family adjusted for inflation.

@charlesarthur American colonies chose to declare independence from Great Britain for many reasons. They believed the British were treating the colonists unfairly British passed many tax laws that impacted the colonists.
@charlesarthur So your definition of free, is Taxation?
@charlesarthur UK provides pub healthcare to all permanent residents, about 58 million people. Healthcare coverage is free at the point of need, and is paid for by general taxation. About 18% of a citizen's income tax goes towards healthcare, which is about 4.5% of the average citizen's income.
@charlesarthur Or you could be honest and say that the idea of taxing more hasn't helped that area and many more just like it!
@charlesarthur We all agree on that! So why didn't it get fixed in the passed 8 years?
@charlesarthur UK is also in charge of if you live or die! People from all over the world come to the US for Health Care. So once again your being dishonest.
@charlesarthur Ok in the past 8 years did the government fix the problem? No, have you been to Chicago lately? It's a mess and they keep taxing more and more!
@charlesarthur Once again your not stating facts your using talking points from the left. Fact is none of us know what will happen. We do know the past plan of taxing more doesn't work.
@charlesarthur The goal should be make people less dependent on government. How you might ask? Maybe tax less, grow the pop of tax payers, new business, new trade agreement. Just a few ideas that make since to average people
@charlesarthur I couldn't be more happy that your brave enough to say that publicly. I can tell you for a fact that's not true. If an individual has more money he can do many thing. Like open a business maybe pay EE more maybe employ more.
@charlesarthur So taxing more solves the problems of witch state? What did JFK think about taxes? I think we both know.
@charlesarthur Not true! We both know, GDP growth is how you build for the future. Taxing more only limits growth. Fact!
@charlesarthur If that were true, the highest taxed states would be doing great, right? We both know they are not and your only idea is tax more?
@charlesarthur Taxing more doesn't solve the problem.
@charlesarthur Lol nice try! Could we afford it before? 20 trillion in debt. Your idea doesn't work as seen in https://t.co/dOKAXbxwdp
@charlesarthur Yes that's true for some people living in high salt states. However you should demand you local government to lower salt. If they don't you should vote them out. I agree with you no doubt but to punish everyone over salts seem excessive.
@charlesarthur I'm not unhappy at all. I am very blessed. Just think both parties would be better served speaking truth. You know as we all do this is a fed tax cut for everyone paying tax.
@charlesarthur So your suggestion is move out of a state because people disagree with you?
@charlesarthur Well you didn't ask where I live you asked about migration.
@charlesarthur That
@charlesarthur Santa Ana CA. Why does tgat mater?
@charlesarthur My father migrated to us in late 80s from Palestine by way of Jordan.
@charlesarthur I was born in US.
@charlesarthur yes tax will go up by 2020 true. That said you know the reason for that.
@charlesarthur Why would you ask a bot to read something? Wait you wanted to discredit, mock and degrade me?
@charlesarthur Um your a joke I took that pick over a year ago.

@SebGorka @realDonaldTrump Lol no she racist bigot! Oh wait maybe she's just worried about security who would've ever thought
@Randelius @SheriffClarke Well since you don't sound very educated I won't embarrass you however collusion does not equate to treason otherwise every president for the past 50 years would've been charged with treason

@miscusername2 @jrw1910 @marklevinshow Either you're an idiot or a Russian boot no one measures who's going to win the popular vote because the popular vote represents nothing for 100 years now the president has been elected by the electoral college I recommend you buying a year subscription of CRTV
@miscusername2 @jrw1910 @marklevinshow Are you saying the same accurate poles that were taken for two years they said Donald Trump had no chance in winning and every pond it on TV would laugh in the face of republican commentators when they announced that they felt Trump would win are those the polls you defend
As a Palestinian I must say there is a big push amongst some more influential members of the Arab community to keep it a secret that Arab-Americans do support tromp in large numbers but are scared of the repercussions @marklevinshow
@marklevinshow I have a story to tell just do have a voice. Maybe the great one will give me a shot. I hold the details of what most families in the east feel about the west. #godblessmarklivin
@marklevinshow I was born to Palestinian parents and we undoubtedly support the state of Israel as the only beacon of peace and prosperity in the Middle East #MAGA
@marklevinshow @marklevinshow  how accurate are these polls showing trumps numbers dropping when no one I know who supports Trump hav been involved in any of the polls?
Question to trump supporters! Have you been call or asked if you support trump? I haven't so how accurate can they be? #losers
Please understand the same poll that said DT had no chance on winning WH are now saying he dropped in approval rating! Ya right. #maga
At this point all parties had contact with Russia but only trump is to blame? Suck it fake new#old news #who gives a damn!
