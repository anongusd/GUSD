Time and time again, Tammy Baldwin has turned her back on Wisconsin and its students. @LeahVukmir provides a stark contrast as a military mom, nurse, and daughter of immigrants with a proven record of standing with Wisconsinites instead of Washington interests.
6️⃣ Tammy Baldwin sided with her liberal allies in the Senate when voting for the dangerous Iran Deal. https://t.co/3gxzoLRQ6T
5️⃣ Instead of seeking out lasting healthcare solutions, Tammy Baldwin supports Bernie Sanders’ $32 trillion dollar healthcare plan. https://t.co/A4d291CKcm
4️⃣ Senator Baldwin neglected her duties as a United States Senator when she said she would not support Brett Kavanaugh after his nomination without meeting with him, and then later stating that she would meet with him. https://t.co/8UUy9rGw19
3️⃣ Tammy Baldwin voted AGAINST tax reform, even when it would save Wisconsin students and their families thousands. https://t.co/TIYvHvTpE0
2️⃣ Young voters already see through Tammy Baldwin’s record with a higher rate of disapproval than approval among 18-29 year olds in recent Marquette polling. https://t.co/dovnYdFEnw
1️⃣ Tammy Baldwin’s solutions to student debt include giving the government more control instead of allowing students to find out what best fits their financial needs. https://t.co/MFNJvU0B5U
It’s clear that @TammyBaldwin is trying to cover up her horrible record for Wisconsin families and students by sending out this email to the @UWMadison student body.		Let’s review in the thread below ⬇️ https://t.co/2dE5uaRrZX
