That's not to say that Patriot Movement AZ is a white nationalist group. It has members who are black, Hispanic and Jewish, and it generally makes no claims of white superiority. But the group has said it uses such symbols to "trigger" people. They've even laughed about it. https://t.co/MAJEvm8BDr

@mayhemily17 Super interesting. Thanks for the heads up.
@bdylan234 @palafo That's an interesting perspective, too. Thanks for the thoughtful response.
@palafo @coreypein Lol. Exactly.
@palafo @coreypein Yes, but it is less convenient to obtain certain books than it is others. If you want to buy some unpopular literature, you can. Amazon might not stock it. But that doesn't mean it's banned. You just have to buy it from a seller that stocks unpopular stuff.
@palafo It sounds like you're coming at it from the perspective of a consumer wanting ease of access ‚Äî all ideas bundled on one device, accessible with a few clicks ‚Äî as opposed to a consumer buying into a curated set of things.
@palafo Haha. It sounds like you do have an opinion, and that's OK! I respect your ideas on media, so I was interested in the fuller explanation. Thanks for indulging me.
@palafo Interesting perspective. In other words, they should be treated like a utility?
@palafo Sure, but that's not a ban. There's an important distinction here between public pressure and government censorship. Without it, the suggestion is Apple and Amazon are obligated to distribute any and all content, which of course they are not.
@OPAmericanJesus It's a national emergency, for sure.
@palafo I'm confused by the book bans reference then. Isn't that generally involving public institutions, like schools and libraries?
@palafo Of course. And where does talk of a  government ban come in? I might have missed something here.

@Johartz You and I see alllll the dimensions.
@sineadrousse Trump and Arpaio have a lot of similar qualities. That's for sure.
@Johartz Never tweet.
End of thread.
In 2014, Arpaio hired a PI to look into a federal judge who was overseeing a case against him and the judge's wife. https://t.co/wabesD8Xgd
(Trump had famously embraced the conspiracy theory that Obama was not a natural born citizen and therefore ineligible to be president.)
In 2012, Arpaio announced that he believed President Obama's birth certificate was fake. https://t.co/7zMlOWOQEt
The prosecutor, Andrew Thomas, was eventually disbarred. Arpaio remained in office. https://t.co/7D0mU4DyCK
State ethics officials later said the investigations were bogus and designed to ruin the reputations of the targets. https://t.co/RA02hiOXKT
The duo ended up investigating at least 14 people, including four judges and five local politicians.
In 2009, Arpaio and the elected county prosecutor began targeting their political enemies with criminal investigations.
In 2007, Arpaio ordered the arrests of the editors of the Phoenix New Times, a newspaper that hounded him for years. https://t.co/zfuzsl1at2
Arpaio's office leaked the investigation to a local TV reporter, who happened to donate $100 to Arpaio's campaign. https://t.co/jrkkfR0UJI
The investigation looked at rape allegations from 30 years earlier by the opponent's adoptive mother.
In 2004, Arpaio's office opened a criminal investigation against a man who was running against him for sheriff.
One observer described the ad as Arpaio returning the "favor" that Napolitano did for him in 1997. https://t.co/K9e1dbfIzT
Five years later, Arpaio filmed a campaign ad for Napolitano when she was running for governor.
Janet Napolitano and Deval Patrick, both DOJ appointees of Bill Clinton, led the investigation and essentially let Arpaio walk.
In 1997, the Justice Department had evidence Arpaio's agency had mistreated inmates in his jails.
Here's an incomplete list of things Joe Arpaio did as sheriff that had nothing to do with his criminal conviction.
@Johartz lol. of course!
Donald Trump's first pardon as president is of fellow birther Joe Arpaio.

@judejoffeblock Fabulists with access have no more credibility than those without it.
@judejoffeblock The document could be real, but it needs independent verification if coming from Corsi and InfoWars. They have zero credibility.

@mikehorton He called Flynn a good guy, but ultimately Trump didn't do anything for Flynn that wasn't in Trump's own interests.
@ahumorlessfem Yeah, I think that's right. Arpaio is past his prime and has very little fan base left. There's nothing in it for Trump.
Anyway, who knows what Trump will ultimately do, but I'm skeptical about all the pardon talk.
"He's going to be just fine" strikes me as putting distance between himself and Arpaio. (Remember, Arpaio was not invited to the rally.)
Trump demands loyalty but rarely gives it in return. What would he gain from pardoning Joe Arpaio?

I'm not sure how long I'll be in Arizona, but it will be long enough to make sure my parents have everything they need to move forward.
I'm currently at Dallas-Fort Worth on a two-hour layover. If all goes well, I'll arrive in Tucson before noon.
I'm flying from NYC to Tucson this morning to see him and my mother, and to help coordinate care.
The recovery process will not be easy. And we're still learning about the extent of his injuries.
Thankfully he's alive and conscious, despite some pretty severe injuries.
He was in a serious crash on Thursday and was taken to a trauma center in Tucson, Arizona.
If you have a little extra care and love to spare, please send it in my father's direction.

@AoDespair I appreciate the thoughtful response. Nullification certainly has that complicated history. And it's contemporary proponents...

@peterkrupa @_neillam I'm not sure I understand.
@bmaz Yeah, it ain't the Pentagon Papers, but the reasons to publish outweighed the reasons to keep it secret. Not an easy call for sure.
@palafo ...in secret, the public is better served by knowing about it, along with the caveats that came with it.
@palafo Yeah, I hear that. And it's not an easy call. But knowing now how many journalists, politicians and spies were pursuing this...
@palafo Caution is important. So is avoiding harm. But sometimes, as the Times often demonstrates, public interest outweighs those concerns.
@palafo This had gone a tad further than an oppo dump by the time BuzzFeed published it, don't you think?
Journalists who had this "dossier" and knew that powerful people were making decisions based on it did the public no favors by sitting on it
Oh, and @albertburneko is basically making that same point here. https://t.co/gKGFXcdvgt https://t.co/A3EJfxDKHK
