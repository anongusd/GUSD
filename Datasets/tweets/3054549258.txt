@JuliaDavisNews welp, I hope Putin's happy. He's sure getting a lot of mileage out of driving an economy that's just as big as New York.

@lennutrajektoor In the South Carolina 9th district, the State board of elections was able to come to a satisfactory conclusion about election fraud in part because of physical access to ballots and all the participants. With an electronic voting machine, fraud may not have left these markers.
@lennutrajektoor With respect, in the US we have seen that eliminating paper also eliminates the physical evidence of voting. It also creates a new attack vector for bad actors, hackers.		We've been hearing about insecure voting machines being used in elections for roughly 20 years.

@CardiffGiants @joshtpm I really do agree with all of this. I'll tweet at my elected reps all day long on that - in my state, one Senator voted for that measure, and another didn't. And I'll tweet at them for not having a proper debate on funding the Israeli military, and for not supporting Palestinians
@ashton @AnandWrites That's the secret to power: Be antisocial, collect everything people drop when they flee you, sell it to the highest bidder.
@simmysamsozzle @piano_exe @tonysea43 @jon_bois OK! :D
@kathrynw5 @jaketapper @AmbJohnBolton "But here's my opinion on what the President actually meant to say, anyway."
@vox__humana @drvox Exactly! It's about removing that fat from the sentence - delicious as marbled bacon may be.
@CardiffGiants @joshtpm For me, the big question is "how does Omar raise these issues and grab headlines WITHOUT raising the specter of political fealty issues &amp; litmus tests." That she is the victim of the exact same types of campaigns should make her reflective on this point!
@CardiffGiants @joshtpm Of course! But raising the specter of disloyalty because somebody has worked with another country goes a step too far. We have seen such rhetoric before, and German-Americans got lynched for it.

@drvox Burgers and bacon ain't seein shit out here.
@ConnorSouthard It's even grander than the New York Times Magazine!
@ebruenig @BAKKOOONN I've tried to make the argument that Omar is reaching for new language to breathe new life into the anger we should be harnessing to stop right-wing Israeli policies and demand, at least, accountability for the military aid we spend there.		I intend to continue doing that, too.
@ebruenig @BAKKOOONN Know what you mean, but I think you know what Josh means too: Omar has said that Israel supporters "hypnotize," they control elections with money, they have dual loyalties.		I think it's tragic that her pro-Palestinian activism is getting this kind of a face.
@scottcmonty @mviser Ambassador Stevens was a Democrat. Don't drag him back into this.		If he was still alive you'd have no compunctions about disrespecting him.
@quinncy There are no words for me. Even taking in the possibility of the conspiracy angle I can't help but feel bad for her. (And the rest of the modeling world. Thanks for this perspective.)
@joshtpm Washington left the first Presidency warning of "entangling alliances," but we have a "special relationship" with the UK, and arguably similar with other nations. Beyond this, the rhetoric simply degrades the debate - and many people want that. Rep. Omar should care about that.
@joshtpm I saw her post fairly early. Gut reaction: Bad. Didn't engage with the commentary until late. Tried to defend her. But ultimately, I had to stick on the same point you did: The "dual loyalties" thing.		I don't know if it was a dog whistle, but we all know people use it as such.
@EXAIR True. https://t.co/Gnxlb3z0Du

@sdw2of6 @escapedmatrix @TeamPelosi @SpeakerPelosi @CoryBooker I'd be for that. But I'm also interested in making sure ocean fish have enough oxygen to breathe - not too much carbon for coral to form islands - and in Michigan, the Flint River is part of a system that leads right to the Great Lakes, which need to be protected.
@karlbykarlsmith @hamandcheese @ne0liberal That's not the vibe I got from his argument that corporate "social responsibility" would lead to totalitarianism.
@andrewkimmel We need a nation in which there is emergency funding for the communities hit hardest by #pollution in their air and water.
@sdw2of6 @escapedmatrix @TeamPelosi @SpeakerPelosi @CoryBooker But that just means there's ongoing health problems that also need to be looked at. Not just in Flint, but it's not as simple as "the water is better, so everything is fixed." Infrastructure and emergency health assistance for communities with #polluted water - 2020 &amp; 2019 issues
@sdw2of6 @escapedmatrix @TeamPelosi @SpeakerPelosi I had a look at @CoryBooker's claim to @escapedmatrix the other night. It appears that it is actually true - Flint's water is better than it was, and many other places have worse lead levels.
@sdw2of6 @escapedmatrix @TeamPelosi @SpeakerPelosi Concur with your analysis. I also think there is a "divestment plague" as billionaires and corporate entities wrangle sweet deals from incompetent states. This, also, makes funding infrastructure harder.
@yashar @LynnePatton @AOC https://t.co/VzRcXinqdn
@AllezLesBoulez I don't see it as such. Ilhan's critique of pro-Israel advocates as having dual loyalties seems to be at odds with the nature of American citizenship, and her comment was part of her direct response to that.		Only the GOP can apologize to @IlhanMN over the racist poster.
@IanRGillespie @mattyglesias To be reasonable, these are all the public caricatures of the standard Berner. Of course, widening that critique is a step only Bernie himself can take.
@OuterheavenPics is this some delicious NUMAN ATHLETICS?!

@tellallyour @TinaDesireeBerg @StevenSilton @NitaLowey For those just beaming in: This was partly based on my misunderstanding of the thread above. I still have critiques, but you'll have to jump around this thread to find them.
@ElizabethWiggs @SethAbramson I will meekly cosign this concern. I think polls have their place, but they are the kind of media cycle hype thing that drowns out the more important policy analysis that I come to Twitter for.
@SethAbramson I was just forced into watching an ad for @RealKidPoker's Masterclass, and he talks about the betting tell. You look down at your chips. I think we all can tell that Trump's mind was elsewhere.		But the more important question is, are there tells for the people who can convict?
@SethAbramson And then somebody else should put a fake cover on Amazon, purporting that the author is the DOJ, by an author with a made-up name like Seafish or Starocean or something.
@oneunderscore__ I would like to downvote this....this is not the premium content I signed up for. Nuh-uh.
@StevenSilton @saminiowa @tellallyour @TinaDesireeBerg @NitaLowey I'm sorry to make you respond to this twice; I wrote this before you issued your first response. I've refreshed my memory since then.
@StevenSilton @saminiowa @tellallyour @TinaDesireeBerg @NitaLowey @IlhanMN I will agree that Ilhan's comments were not helpful (and I had, embarrassingly, forgotten about her "hypnotism" remarks).		But that still does leave the issue of what Lefty-Desiree said upthread - Jewish and Israeli are not interchangeable, if we want to remind @IlhanMN of this.
@AnalyticsPlant @KT_So_It_Goes rip, rice paper walker
@DrJenGunter Is there going to be a chapter entitled, "how to walk your dog when he is bad?" I might have to buy it...		It seems like that is basically the substance of 99% of abortion / infanticide 'debates' on Twitters.
@saminiowa @tellallyour @TinaDesireeBerg @StevenSilton @NitaLowey Still haven't seen Steven clarify whether he meant Rep. Omar or in general - though, given his sweeping characterization, that'd be an awful lot to charge @IlhanMN with, given that she's never claimed "Jews have magical powers."
@saminiowa @tellallyour @TinaDesireeBerg @StevenSilton @NitaLowey It's hard to move past 1.) when nobody else does. We could agree that Rep. Omar's charge invites mischaracterizations, and that Rep. Lowey was referring just to that. But Steven's tweet introduced a strawman; literally nobody was saying those things.
Likewise, the interaction of domestic &amp; international groups in domestic politics is a simple reality. There is nothing preventing dual citizenship. We need to look at Israel's policies, not scare others about the motives of those who support Israel. We do the same for you.
Some people support you for the hope of pressuring Israel, but others would rather see the US abandon all support for Israel, regardless of the need. I won't support those in the second camp and feel you should do the same.
Rep. @IlhanMN, I've been disappointed by the way US policy towards Israel has not gotten a strong debate, and angered by the lack of even-handed diplomacy that treats Palestinians as equal partners. But we should weigh our words.
@simquim @Hebahersi @IlhanMN @Amy_Siskind @mehdirhasan [citation needed]	One reason why the West acquiesced to the foundation of Israel is because pogroms on Jewish populations continued after the war.

@MaxGhenis we're going to tell the people what democratic socialism is
@conor64 @mattyglesias @AdamSerwer I look at your magnificent piece, and then I look at this Tweet, where it appears to boil down to whether or not some fact about the inner life of a highly paid defense attorney is epistemologically verifiable.
@saminiowa @tellallyour @TinaDesireeBerg @StevenSilton @NitaLowey I suppose it's not obfuscation to pretend that @TinaDesireeBerg did not make a comment about the conflation of Israeli policy debate with debate about Jews, and then only admit that there may be criticisms of Israel in a parenthetical, in a follow-up response.		That's not plain.
@AnandWrites His goal of protecting diabetics was discounted at his brother WK's company, where small amounts of sugar were seen as necessary flavor. The company had passed on from the founding generation's health roots by the time the sugar wars really got underway, of course.
@AnandWrites Side note: The sugar-i-fication of vitamin spray-coated breakfast cereals may have been a precedent to this, although the nutritional science was definitely better understood by the time of the fast food push. Cereal pioneer Dr. JH Kellogg eschewed sugar to protect diabetics.
@AnandWrites At the same time studies (by who, I don't know) showing that this would be the effect, but those stories were buried under the avalanche of "human interest reports for corporations" signalling the virtue of the hamberder joints.
@DogWithOpinions @ebruenig @randygdub and then this is the point where a Second Amendment fundie shows up to tell us that what other people do is their business, it's not like there are "rules of gun safety" or something, it's a mystery. (Buy more guns)
@RedTRaccoon I think that people don't actually buy antiques. They just go window-shopping to be in the presence of historical kitsch. Should charge a ticket for entry and be done with it.
@ebruenig But we can't mention @IlhanMN in this context. :/
@kyry5 @pant_leg Nice trees are pretty important.
@DogWithOpinions @ebruenig @randygdub and then they proceed to shoot their toes off
@ebruenig @randygdub no, no, what are you doing, stahp
@randygdub 1 to listen to the right wing tail's radio scanner, 1 to research the MPG of the vehicle, 1 to liaise w/the @MTA and find out that it was indeed blocks from the subway		Probably a few dozen union employees in the print shop tho.
@jonathanchait So, ref. a discussion I'm having with @JoshuaParkhurst, we should also be considering the state of 'debate' and representation, when it has proven time and again to be deadly to careers in &amp; out the Beltway to even suggest critiques of Israeli policy. There has been no room.
@JoshuaParkhurst @IlhanMN @NitaLowey I'd agree that there is a lot of Twitter demagoguery from the left these days...but it's disingenuous to suggest even the Dem party has had any tolerance for it so far.		To your second point, you may be right she is anti-Israel. Again, there was no room for the moderate critique.
@JohnCarltonKing @mattyglesias Well, I don't see the causality working that neatly. People are still fighting the Civil War because they believe that it was a Northern push to disenfranchise them.		@mattyglesias: Power in all its forms. Why the dismissiveness towards the "both" answer? It's depressing.
@JoshuaParkhurst @IlhanMN @NitaLowey This is what we reap when we pretend that Israel policy does not have a privileged position in US politics, and force out voices who seek to alter that balance.		And also, I can't get past the question - how else does she really get the caucus to take it on, without fireworks?
@JoshuaParkhurst @IlhanMN @NitaLowey And, secondly, if @NitaLowey's comment was not equating 9/11-invoking racism with questioning the allegiance of people who will not find money for domestic US needs but will find money for letting Israel not have to pay for US-built armaments, and not even tie it to oversight.
@JoshuaParkhurst @IlhanMN @NitaLowey That might be convincing if, first, it weren't true that there is a long history of Israel policy skeptics facing campaigns of harassment &amp; exclusion from the public sphere, even for simply pointing out the general contours of that pressure campaign.
@peterdaou Just look at Netanyahu. Under the threat of indictment for at least 10 years, still limping along, still moving right.
@mattyglesias @AdamSerwer @conor64 Every constitutional good is even better when you can afford to throw unlimited cash at it! What a selfless hero, right?
@JoshuaParkhurst @IlhanMN @NitaLowey Is that a "yes" to no debate, as if there was ever going to be a debate without getting under the skin of people who wanted to sign an irrevocable 10-year aid bill with no debate?		Or is that a yes to "Ilhan deserves that poster?"
@Wolfwalk47 @realDonaldTrump The military parades are further opportunities for making the White House payout, of course. He will probably be looking to decree that Trump Org entities will be present and getting paid for his July 4th bust, too.
@JoshuaParkhurst @IlhanMN @NitaLowey In that time we have seen Palestinians continue to get killed &amp; evicted, Netanyahu on the brink of indictment and supporting Kahanism, and GOP franchises putting out posters connecting IlhanMN to 9/11.		And still no debate.

@RedTRaccoon @Politico hard at work with those weasel words: Nowhere does Warner say the conspiracy &amp; collusion is "possible." He says nobody can say there isn't plenty of evidence for conspiracy and collusion.
@shamtley @ConnorSouthard https://t.co/XuizL9LTgh
@JoshuaParkhurst @IlhanMN @NitaLowey @NitaLowey's critique ended by asking @IlhanMN to "engage in further dialogue." Not a damn thing about the Israel policy!		Look, I often think far leftist rhetoric is overbearing. It doesn't give me the right to just march in there and use that to divert from their aims.
@JoshuaParkhurst @IlhanMN @NitaLowey Is phrases like "the third rail of American politics" or "entangling alliances" bigoted too? Every time I watch this rodeo I ask myself "so what are they proposing other than that she water down her critique into something they can say doesn't have votes or doesn't matter?"
@RedTRaccoon 50% of people are demented as of this very moment
@tellallyour @TinaDesireeBerg @StevenSilton @NitaLowey Then he needs to say so plainly. This kind of assumed support and quick retreat from the strong position is a depressingly common theme in US-Israel policy debates.
@NitaLowey You talk about "debate" but the only thing you're calling for is for @IlhanMN to stop talking about Israel and to "engage in further dialogue" - basically, to retreat from her demands entirely.		I'll be more supportive of this position when we actually do debate Israel policy.
@JoshuaParkhurst @IlhanMN @NitaLowey Bruh, it's too late for this. "engage in further dialogue" shows where the true aims of @IlhanMN's critics lie: With getting her to shut up about the issue.

@47gingie We literally give Israel money to buy US equipment. $38Bn/10 years.		My point isn't that this is necessarily bad. The point is that we all act that this funding is sacred and must continue, at the same time that we cannot critique Israeli policy.

@IlhanMN The treatment of her activism on this issue seems reminiscent of Rep. Tlaib's comments during the Cohen hearings, where Tlaib merely attempted to call attention to a racist display; political correctness only harms those trying to strip bad actors from hiding under identity.
@IlhanMN If she says something inoffensive like "we need to have a debate" then that will lead her detractors to feel that they can just point to the status quo, smirk, and walk away from confronting this "entangling alliance" as a matter of even-handed diplomacy for the region.
@IlhanMN Honestly, how is Rep. Omar supposed to highlight the fact that many US politicians have seen fit to defund domestic needs, but will not countenance even a debate on the US support for Netanyahu's government, and our funding of their military?
@SkyLightPattern @VeeCeeMurphy76 @OutstandingWC @realtalkforyou @nhannahjones That's kind of the point!
@HenryPorters So let's say it was something like "why don't we have a debate about why Israel gets funding." It invites 'spaining. It's almost as if you're not allowed to state your apprehension of obvious facts, a point we saw recently with Rep. @RashidaTlaib during the Cohen hearings.
@HenryPorters I would love more nuance, but all the Israel policy apologists are damn well aware that something anodyne like "the unchallenged primacy of Israel policy funding and preeminence in US politics" does not get the point across succinctly &amp; the whole point is to bury this reality.

@KGman08 @LalamarMc @CNBC It's not true that corporations only get money from consumers - defense spending alone is nearly 5% of GDP, and that's before other government spending. But anyway, you do realize that taxes are a way to give money back to us? That Bill Gates is spending a lot in Africa?

@Noahpinion The movie's full of anachronisms and its treatment of American subjects (slavery and the West) is simply ahistorical, but it makes its point: Here was Japanese myth-making culture taking on the exclusionary Yamato Race theory, and plenty more besides. https://t.co/P2BwAb6SgA
@Noahpinion PM Nakasone's clarification implied that Japan had smoothly prospered beyond the bakumatsu period due to the absence of racial frictions. Kamui no Ken, however, is the story of a young Ainu through vignettes of racist oppression in that very period. https://t.co/RJuOBgNeB6
@Noahpinion Anime is like any other artform, holding a mirror up to reality.

@IanRGillespie @mattyglesias @_TimBarker Given that I can't find direct answers from the 1/4 of economists who reportedly would not strongly agree that price controls are always bad, the answer appears to be that we should simply redistribute wealth to those caught on the wrong side of employment in shock treatment.

@iwrotesham @emmaesquared @cricketcrocker @matthewasears Hi Steve. I dabbled a bit with journalism &amp; philosophy in college. Those were the good old days when we had movies that said things like "with great power comes great responsibility," remember them?		Trying to pretend a choice has no moral dimensions seems blind to me.
@Gimpanzee123 @MaajidNawaz @facebook The fix doesn't necessarily have to be hard - it probably requires funding properly to avoid burnout and to cope with the likelihood that many people will not want to be content moderators for a career (or even for a few months, if the article is correct).
@Gimpanzee123 @MaajidNawaz It is worse than just paying taxes. As long as communities self-police and also get to choose how they fund their content moderation, we will see things like this @facebook: https://t.co/tmIOSaI3EC
@ErynnBrook I'm just pointing out that a lot of people who take public funds - in universities, for example - to address these very same topics have little to no incentive to play nice with others.		I'm not putting down social media or other community efforts, but taxes are being spent.
@MaajidNawaz @tom_watson As for putting a bunch of police or humans moderators on the topic, well: https://t.co/tmIOSaI3EC		I've read that China's anti-porn content police also have found their job emotionally distressing, too.		We should put a lot more money into this problem.
@MaajidNawaz @tom_watson I think this is the right argument, but we need an awful lot more infrastructure &amp; sophistication to be able to remove baddies, without infringing on the rights of those who are simply exercising free speech. AI and content category bans often backfire.
@Gimpanzee123 @MaajidNawaz The mass deployment of bots and blanket bans on content, under the theory of preventing pedophilia or brand-adverse free speech, has also failed.		It is naturally easier to go after individual offenders who can be found and shamed. Oftentimes the mass programs backfire.
@AvBronstein @PopChassid Or we could start shifting the focus of our service towards defense, in the mold of the traditional post-war Japanese Self-Defense Forces.
@PopChassid The "just war" and techno-worshipping (to put it politely) aims of US defense establishment propaganda are never going to be reconciled.
@NYforSanders one of us, one of us!
@ErynnBrook Ex: https://t.co/fAKf0BAZLy		There are a lot of people looking at ways to combat this, but I think we need to fight against the general presumption of "second place is the first loser."
@ErynnBrook Intellectual property law rewards the lone author, and collaborators risk losing their investment (contracts can prevent this, but it's not automatic). Academia often gets stuck on particular topics, and in those systems less famous (or female) co-authors often lose recognition.
@ErynnBrook The development of individual-focused rights has left a lot of stumbling blocks towards this. Currently, it is more attractive to be a lone author when possible, or even to outright steal ideas from other for the sake of credit. A few related arenas:
@ErynnBrook Promoting collaboration - where opportunities and rewards are shared by a community - would make it easier and more attractive for people to do this. (We also should note different people have different things to contribute, so it's not simply a matter of submerging one's ego.)
@KGman08 @LalamarMc @CNBC This is the first time I've ever read a sentence stating that taxes want to be implemented.		I don't understand the rest of your argument. You're saying that companies shouldn't pay taxes because they get money from consumers? You want them to hoard the money?

@HTTOrganizers @Bravewriting @smellypulpit It's what they did to split apart many native tribes. "Oh, you can have this and that land...will you sell me somebody else's horse? Thanks."

@nahaltoosi The guy drinking ketchup straight from the bottle while talking on his Razr makes me nostalgic, so I will take you up on that bet!
@DanielLarison Yeah, CNN should do better with the historical context. Trump &amp; MbS are a perfect storm of dumb &amp; villainy, and strangling critics who are also legal residents of Virginia is a severe escalation. But we have countenanced worse for years.
@SethAbramson At the same time, it is just an odd thing to say. Americans can have dual citizenship and, though we are meant to put America first, it just strikes me as a really weird standard to apply just to Israel, and rather unreflective on her part.
@SethAbramson Not my place to say "putting aside the rhetoric," but, putting aside the rhetoric, how do we really characterize the fact that of all the "entangling alliances," US financial &amp; material support for Israel often goes without a proper debate?
@smellypulpit @HTTOrganizers @Bravewriting A good result of this is that we don't have to think money will solve systematic racism. We have more direct programs, law, and cultural tools to attack that problem.		All this said, I do have a natural (white) interest &amp; bias for no reparations.
@smellypulpit @HTTOrganizers @Bravewriting My personal belief is that there's too many of these "gotchas." What if reparations fails to live up to its hype, and people say "racism is solved?" What if Bill Cosby gets all the money, etc. My view is still that we should find who needs money &amp; help, and give it to them.
@SethAbramson @PreetBharara @SethAbramson is right as usual. Credibility issues does not mean that we just arbitrarily pick a position that makes Cohen look as bad as possible, without considering which possibility was the more likely.
@SFmaman1 @no_more_nazis @SethAbramson @PreetBharara @NRA They don't like how it smells when the wind doubles back, that's all.		It's fine to be a skunk until then.
@acoopermd @JimmyKimmelLive @ladygaga Well, somebody's gotta teach Trump how to pay the piper, right?
@HTTOrganizers @Bravewriting @smellypulpit Not to throw a wrench in the works, but there's plenty of theories about how white privilege became law. Some people focus on institutions, while other people seek to attach a dollar cost to the value of education bought &amp; paid for in part via slavery.
@rtraister This is good &amp; helps rebrand the party. On the flip side, though, it seems she's behind on getting regional offices set up, which is something representatives often do. I don't know the details of how that gets done. What funds it? These offices, however, do good for constituents
@Hebahersi Ahh, it clicks. This is why he's gone to the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region.		The case for stopping him was never clearer.
@smellypulpit @Bravewriting Accounting for slavery, jim crow, and lost opportunities would probably amount to much more than this. How do you really pay for hundreds of years of cultural genocide, forced illiteracy, lynching, and lost opportunities, just to name a few things?		Money isn't equal to the task.
I'm dedicating this thread to Dr. America mainly, tho "The Case for Reparations" by Ta-Nehisi Coates is naturally part of this story.	https://t.co/1yOmvxhTjm		Some hashtags for good measure: #reparations #DoctorAmerica		END
Dr. America was mentioned (or appeared in?) an episode of The Diane Rehm show some years back, which started my interest on the subject. 		Finally, Dr. America himself appears in a couple videos on CSPAN:	https://t.co/9Vncw07USy		I have to catch up, and I hope others will share!
There's a partial rebuttal from 1994, which I see largely agrees with many of my thoughts, here:	https://t.co/wIaAA1e0BE	(Tidwell also wrote "A Profile of the Black Unemployed, I think.)
He also wrote a book in 1990 called "The Wealth of Nations," discussed here:	https://t.co/I2sJBl6ABI	So it's very clear where he's coming from - searching for a technical solution to inequality via reparations.
He wrote a book called "Developing the Afro-American economy" in, depending on what online source you look at, was published in 1975, '76, or '77. I haven't tracked down a copy yet, but reportedly he begins talking about reparations here.
@Bravewriting, the thinker who got me interested in reparations &amp; achieving equity is Dr. Richard F. America. At least, that's what I think his name is. It's very hard to find good information about him online, but he has been advocating a technical solution for years. To start:
@JerryB17480215 @paulkrugman I would split off the socialist thing. Many of us just got sick 'n tired of the failed dogma of deregulation, and Occupy Wall Street ended up having its message co-opted. If anything, QE looked like closing the barn after the horses fled - too little and too late.
@JerryB17480215 @paulkrugman has made exactly the same arguments re: inflation hype and QE. So it seems that perhaps the author either is starting fresh, or perhaps he's trying to sneak a revision of that history in the back door because QE wasn't a painless remedy.
@Bravewriting IMO, what makes it frustrating that Bernie is even talking about reparations is...it's a strawman. Of course there are going to be people who are going to get mad whenever you suggest fighting systematic racism &amp; want to hold onto their every penny no matter what it does.
@Bravewriting It seems to me that it would be much simpler to just say that we're going to fund stuff properly &amp; look for equality of outcomes (not only opportunity) because you don't have to violate norms of justice or get into blood quantum &amp; ancestry litigation to do that.
@Bravewriting Strike fairly. I don't see how reparations get administered at all.		Since I and (presumably) Donald Trump do not have slaveowners in our family history, it seems to me that reparations for slavery would necessarily have to be followed by reparations for systematic racism.
@Bravewriting I think it would be a lot more straightforward to do actual means testing &amp; fight systematic racism, than it would be to go into the blood quantum hell, ADOC, and all the other weird things that would make reparations actually impossible to administer fairly.
@JerryB17480215 So yeah this is beyond weird. The consensus then and now - and what was obvious even to people just reading the headlines at the time Bear Stearns collapsed - was that the banks goofed. Absent QE, I don't see young home ownership getting a boost while the economy had tanked.
@JerryB17480215 Humorously enough, the author's supporting links are also paywalled! QE was one measure in a bipartisan effort to reverse some of the widespread destruction caused by the banks.		No QE would have meant destroying home asset values as well as destroying many job opportunities.
@PreetBharara Sometimes, there's no true believer like a convert.		Sure, everything he said was catnip for Dems, but it also was what needed to be said. “I’m responsible for your [GOP Reps'] silliness because I did the same thing that you’re doing now for 10 years,”
@JerryB17480215 I haven't gotten far into details - but yes, I do think us youngsties heard the message loud and clear that home ownership wasn't going to be our end game. Now, blaming QE for that? Different ballgame entirely.
@realjustinzero @Popehat Call me cynical, but he was just wandering around looking fine last year. I don't know better than his doc, but I wouldn't be surprised if the wheelchair was an act. We've seen that kind of thing before.		Furthermore, segregating him may prevent further bad acts.
@LeftwardSwing fwiw, the whole window on what's possible has shifted left, so let's not lose sight of this astonishingly hopeful moment :)
@GodzillaMindset @FraserMacLeod5 @JayInslee Yeah. The "mix of energy sources" talk, esp. w/r/t fossil fuels, is the utilities' argument about how they'd like to milk current technology and depreciating physical plants, which is nothing to do with the current consensus on climate change.
@realjustinzero @Popehat You don't see the value in strongly deterring the kinds of acts he has been accused of?
@pareene @bobbyfinger Is it weird that I knew this but haven't even seen the movie since a few years after it came out?
@ConnorSouthard @Trillburne Doing The Gipper's work, both of you.		Wonder if I can get a rise outta the ole feller by reminding him that Reagan did more damage to the US Navy than he will ever manage?
@MichiruMichiMi @EveningStarNM @SwiFT__1889 @lachlan @SearsAl did the US fight the Civil War because the South wanted slavery or because the South fired on Ft. Sumter		that is the level we are at here
@the_Bigandtasty @mcarrington @AOC oh nice, I was waiting for the 2000s to return
@douglasmack What lies just under the surface? The Snomo knows.
@FraserMacLeod5 @JayInslee Where can I find an analysis of the nuclear prospectus? It's been a while since I last read on the subject and plants weren't doing very well getting off the ground. On top of that, the various unique issues about nuclear power will make it a more difficult political expenditure.
@RogueEvildoer @bend_time Yeah, I saw that on shelves two days ago. Unfortunately it's another dispensable brush head deal, so you're paying for not just a more expensive model, but expensive plastic waste generation on top of that.		Regular ole Wakterpit runs just nice. https://t.co/NMkYcxFFdv
@FraserMacLeod5 @mattgilblezy @JayInslee Yeah. We were talking about the Paris Accords while the Twin Towers were still standing. 20 years later, I don't think the US misleadership on climate change gives us much room to criticize.		The future of trade fights with China is likely to be mostly centered on IP.
@Brian_Riedl @Noahpinion The party-at-large didn't want Trump to cut their tax refunds, either.
@Noahpinion Seriously, Glenn Keller could have just asked Bruce Bartlett for his perspective:		https://t.co/LOkUbXpPA3
@basmithart @amb573 @AmbJohnBolton It doesn't need to lead to an actual project in the next 10 years. The apparent postponement of Trump Tower Moscow doesn't seem to have harmed a certain Trans-Pacific Partnership.
@jbouie that website is basically an inverted Twitter bot handle
@JayInslee Hi Jay! Many people don't know about your serious enviro credentials, but people are hearing a lot about fracking in some kind of supposed connection with your time as Governor. Addressing that is going to be tough. I think the best bet here is an audition for EPA or similar!
@FraserMacLeod5 @rbnearthesea @JayInslee Not nearly a quick enough timeframe. Shutting down working plants prematurely is one thing, but as you point out there's significant hurdles to nuclear. Even with a significant deregulation effort I don't see it as being short-term viable.
@mattgilblezy @FraserMacLeod5 @JayInslee These are both important facts that are obviously going to be a part of ongoing climate discussions. We have to start from the assumption that all parties are serious about the problem, and resist seeing it as a vehicle for stealth trade wars. If China tries to cheat it's on them
@saipanblogger @edyong209 @TheAtlantic BTW, how many contacts does your community have with "native twitter" - mainland indigenous Americans? They'd be happy to help get the word out. A stronger voice for the oppressed &amp; colonized is good for everybody.

@LeftwardSwing But so was John @JohnDingell! Rawr!
@mk_ultros He definitely strikes me as working in the Continental model, post-structural.
@mk_ultros For the accidental vampire amongst us. Environmentally unfriendly glitter not included. https://t.co/WI7vCACzgD
@RebeccaRHelm @saipanblogger @DrAndrewThaler @edyong209 @TheAtlantic He's got a good point. There's really not a clear delineation between a "natural environment" story and a "human interest" one and I bet the local reporters could tell us a lot about their experience with that pollution - not to mention lead on getting it fixed.
@saipanblogger @edyong209 @TheAtlantic Let's have a chat with the people from @TheAtlantic about sharing the platform with people from endangered or exposed communities. That being said, it seems counterproductive to try and dunk on the overworked reporter for what's ultimately a structural problem across news media.

@HenryPorters @imillhiser @charles_gaba @AOC My gut was telling me that was a bad point.
@joshtpm @ShibleyTelhami It'll be interesting to see if the general public have more stomach for Biden's old-fashioned collegial tendencies than the Twitter Primary would have us believe.
@Stevietheman66 Lager: The only thing that can kill a vindaloo!
@HenryPorters @imillhiser @charles_gaba @AOC Ahh, the double-edged sword of the Hill Insider Brigade, huh?		Agreed that she needs to set up an organization for her district as soon as possible, namely, yesterday.
@Popehat What's the antonym of feelony? I'm thinking of the "process crime exemption."
@G_Padraic I think the operative word here is "redemption," isn't it? Somebody who's been sentenced to life imprisonment does not seem to be on a path to redemption. Now, maybe it's wrong to have life imprisonment, then. But I feel totally fine with not allowing war criminals in, for ex.
@HenryPorters @imillhiser @charles_gaba @AOC To be fair, it might not be incompetence but just a Carter-esque determination to manage &amp; carry her own bags :)
@joshtpm This is a more substantive process than getting vetted for security clearance at the Trump Taj Mahal Scotland.
@4everNeverTrump Clearly, the "wisdom of the American people" rationale for allowing the Executive broad discretion in granting clearances is faulty, but a robust system for vetting &amp; resolving unfavorable judgments is workable if all Administration parties are acting for the public interest.
@4everNeverTrump What I don't know is if that other example of political interference happened during the current Administration, if it happened during any others, what policies were in place to mitigate potential impacts, or whether they were also Presidential directives.
@4everNeverTrump Months ago, as today, we learned Carl Kline overruled the experts over 30 times since his installation as a political czar in May 2017. At the same time it was reported that the expert opinion had been overruled once before in the three years preceding.		https://t.co/Zndspz1bor

@xenocryptsite @jdmontana @mattyglesias @HenryKraemer @DHSgov Sad how all this talk about @mattyglesias, who just dropped 1 tweet in this discussion, is continuing to derail it :/ You are asking good questions imo.
@noosch @UROCKlive1 Moths to the flame.
@UROCKlive1 He gets in trouble when he lets the truth out, too.
@BumphBean @tomscocca @ashleyfeinberg Don't worry, they are working on that problem right now!
@UROCKlive1 @realDonaldTrump To be fair to Trump - it's hard to snitch on your sources properly when you are busy spending characters on ChARLOTTESVILLE and HELSINKI and other WORDS Trump used to parade his mental decline in front of the world, including Mr. Cohen.
@jdmontana @mattyglesias @xenocryptsite @HenryKraemer @DHSgov I'm not sure what tipped you to me, but in any case, it seems like we agree. Yay!
@JustinSalhani @ashleyfeinberg Nope. I'm going to 'blame' diversity for bringing this wonderful bit of snark into the lexicon, though! #DIVERSITY
@ashleyfeinberg This is the public discourse we need.
@jdmontana @mattyglesias @xenocryptsite @HenryKraemer @DHSgov It should be no problem if we shoot that down, then, right? I really don't understand what you're trying to do here, lol
@joshjob42 @drvox Exactly. There's politics involved in getting taxes allocated for green plans (remember Solyndra, the right's punching bag for an otherwise successful program), and at the same time, carbon taxes inherently allow emissions.
@jdmontana @mattyglesias @xenocryptsite @HenryKraemer @DHSgov I don't understand the original question as being simply about how we allocated money historically. The question is whether those services were actually beneficial, as @HenryKraemer's critique suggests. Failing to make this distinction seems to derail the discussion.
@realDonaldTrump A late claim once you've gotten off the plane that you "hold North Korea responsible...." is NOT a muscular defense of the rights of the American citizen abroad. You must say it to THEIR FACE and not waver from getting this answer.		Stop being a sniveling toady for Kim Jong Un!
@realDonaldTrump Mr. President, what you feel you have done doesn't count.		It is among the duties of the President to take EVERY opportunity to make sure other leaders KNOW they will be punished for torturing and murdering our fellow citizens.
@IAM_J4M35 @DonaldJTrumpJr And since you seem to be conflating a bunch of stuff together: I'm not in favor of taking guns away from people who are law-abiding and responsible.		People who are irresponsible are obvious risks to themselves and others.
@IAM_J4M35 @DonaldJTrumpJr We have police DEPARTMENTS who have decided to undertake a silent form of protest against sensible reporting requirements. This is not "a police officer" and people don't know about it until there is a tragedy and the news reports on it.		Police departments don't make the law!
@IAM_J4M35 @DonaldJTrumpJr "He's not heavy, he's my brother." I didn't hear this kind of talk from people who were discussing the Rules of Gun Safety, did you?		It's a CULTURAL problem. When you put effort into dismissing attempts to encourage best practices, you aren't doing a thing against gun grabs.
@Stevietheman66 This neatly shows up the arguments that Affirmative Action (and Title IX for that matter) is a barrier to white attainment.
@jdmontana @mattyglesias @xenocryptsite @HenryKraemer @DHSgov I might have missed a response somewhere, but I didn't see anybody else raising a point about defense spending being wasteful until I did. Point me in the right direction?
@jdmontana @mattyglesias @xenocryptsite @HenryKraemer The first graph doesn't show a drop. The as-a-percentage graph doesn't suggest that either when you factor in Vietnam.		BTW, we also arguably split away a gigantic chunk of actual defense spending under @DHSgov and the huge intel sector, which includes the private sector.
@SethAbramson @Amazon you'd better pay attention or I might get those Manfrotto quick release plates from @BHPhotoVideo instead!

@SenatorDurbin @SenDuckworth Reliability means provision for maintenance and fallback systems to automatically take over in the case of frontline equipment failures.

I hope it won't startle you too much to know that there are laws on the books allowing police to take guns from felons. They also aren't often enforced enough. Why? It's not gun grabbers...
@CMargaronis @4everNeverTrump @MalcolmNance @realDonaldTrump @realDonaldTrump claimed that he was going to "Make America Great Again," but he's sending a message to the world's worst dictators: You can kill us and we won't stand up to you for it.

@4everNeverTrump @LindseyGrahamSC @realDonaldTrump I just tweeted the same at @realDonaldTrump himself.		Trump just closed the door on #JusticeForOtto, and how Lindsey is giving Trump cover. We're not going to be able to re-litigate this. NK is getting away with literal murder!

@talkingnewmedia @drvox @OsitaNwanevu took some fun pictures of (R)s speaking to the auditorium while it was full of ghosts and the regular attendees were off in drum circles hitting their Juuls. An appropriate visual metaphor for the narcissistic red party.
@drvox I'm trying to think of some visuals that would be hard-left mirror images of what we've heard at CPAC but I'm coming up short. The most radical things I see on Twitter are still not as deranged, bloodthirsty, or racist as the feed from CPAC.		We'd have to see public beheadings.
@jdmontana @mattyglesias @xenocryptsite It's a very reasonable take if you consider dumping bombs in the jungle for want of targets a "public service." But that would seem to miss the point of @HenryKraemer's original statement.
@basquiatball @drvox Davos is nothing if not strait-laced, and the idea that the billionaires in attendance are all progressives like Bill Gates has been thoroughly debunked.

@jonathanchait However, what would George Washington have said? This seems fairly identical, as a matter of argument, to his position on "entangling alliances." Surely we can have "special relationships" but when does it go to the level of actually having dual loyalties? And is that bad?
@jonathanchait I really want to weigh in on this but also don't want to. It's a minefield. But the highest gloss is, as always, that you can have the right tenor to your remarks in total, but step out of line for a few words and you're anti-semitic again.		That said, I don't understand her here
@Saz__zewar tums, ranitidine tablet		be careful with tums though, too many can apparently trigger some neurological reactions
@kking74914 @electricfire89 I have to state this as well: It's my policy not to delete tweets, so that there is a record of what I've said and that I can be accountable. It's not in my best interest to try and whitewash anything I have done badly. I hope that does not cause further distress.
@DonaldJTrumpJr Don, why is it that whenever I discuss the issue of guns left around carelessly somebody immediately pipes up with some variant of "not my problem?"		There has been NO cultural leadership on this issue from many prominent Second Amendment activists.
@Andrew___Baker laff
@SamWalkers @WSJ We need to dig deeper! I know you can do it! :)
@DailyMirror I'm more worried about...well, literally anything, than what some person wants to do for themselves. No sex? No problem!
@4everNeverTrump Even if this is "simply" a rogue AI story, it's a story. There has to be leadership. Letting an automated entity make press &amp; release decisions like this is an abdication of leadership.
@VinceSchilling This is the kind of leadership the world needs - sometimes, all it takes is one kind word.
@4everNeverTrump @FBIRecordsVault Really important questions. I hope @oversightdems can find some time to find out what's going on.		Remember, as well, that @Comey's 11th hour pressers on Hilary were reportedly due to threats from partisan Republicans within the department. Who's running the show?
@SamWalkers @WSJ I'm not going to accuse you of writing a fluff piece, but somebody needs to have a seat and look at the balance of stories drowning out important policy discussions. Everybody can have their area of expertise but it's starting to look like a forest full of blind trees here.
@cowboyinbrla @petersagal But that only works if the people looking into your check are dumb enough to believe the memo. A check for a retainer agreement that DOES NOT EXIST should be a red flag!

@VickerySec All it would take to keep the system going, given post-quantum cryptographic methods, would be a hard fork of the blockchain.		Of course, the revelation of what's in the blockchain would still be disaster for anybody who relies on the history of the blockchain to remain secret.
@VickerySec One possible solution is through the development of so-called "post-quantum cryptography."		Personally, I'm a quantum grump and think quantum computers being able to do all that's promised only slightly more likely than faster-than-light communication through entanglement.

@TrumpsTies Straight out of Hellraiser.
@rasputinmethod @Sherrod4POTUS @politijack @NateSilver538 @SherrodBrown I think @Sherrod4POTUS and myself are talking about what we expect. I would rather see #M4A be considered as a serious contender and pushed as hard as possible - just not to the exclusion of other plans.		Same as my view on candidates. Go for the best, but no negative campaign.
Hi @RepDanKildee, did you know about @escapedmatrix trying to get media attention for Flint's water crisis? I think you guys should get together!
@maxo531 @kenklippenstein We have the best money-sniffing dogs, the best, incomparable! Just don't sic them on #POTUS or they might never recover.
@HongPong On the subject of medical atrocities, I noticed Pennsylvania's 12th district was open. Reason? @reptommarino, who withdrew from the "drug czar" position when we learned he wrote legislation to protect drug companies, resigned at the beginning of his term to work pharma.
Following that @DwightEvansPA asked some good follow-throughs on the related point of US-China relations. Can't find the CSPAN video, though it is apparently from this session:	https://t.co/lPxGuYzzjU
@RepDonBeyer asked an important question of Lighthizer on Wednesday: Is the Trump Administration using the detention of CFO Meng Wanzhou in order to engage in transactional diplomacy with China?		Naturally Lighthizer couldn't answer.
@HongPong @RioSlade Yes, that's something I can agree on, and why I don't like using "Nazi!" unless it's actually relevant.
@leeleeb50 @mmpadellan He belongs on the list of People Who Need To Grab Their Shinebox
@rasputinmethod @Sherrod4POTUS @politijack @NateSilver538 @SherrodBrown As far as voting for somebody else, I'm rooting for the girls, yass. ;) But Sherrod needs some love too.
@rasputinmethod @Sherrod4POTUS @politijack @NateSilver538 @SherrodBrown You know that cuts both ways. Obamacare was much better than nothing. Love Bernie, love M4A, don't love his years of not getting many bills passed.		The demographics in Congress are moving the right way, but in the meantime we need something better, not "the perfect" solution.
@RioSlade @HongPong Did you not read what I just wrote? That's a matter for reparations. Their researchers can come from anywhere in the world and shouldn't be attacked just because they work there.
@inthesedeserts Is this the failed RoboCop that pulls its mask off and dies?
@HongPong @RioSlade We're not talking about war reparations, where it is appropriate to call them out.		But when other companies do the same things or worse, it's cowardly to attack them for that history which has no special bearing on their current activity. Medical ethics are everybody's concern.
@JamilSmith We have a severe problem in Congress that under the guise of "institutional comity" participants are effectively banned from making even-handed, good-faith criticisms of their colleagues.		It's PC culture gone amok!
@RioSlade @HongPong The Holocaust's aftermath saw a profound change in how the medical community saw its research obligations. What shifts medicine back towards unethical behavior is not a Nazi heritage, but the greed &amp; lawless egotism that contributed to Naziism in the first place.
@RioSlade @HongPong What are you talking about? I'm talking about the many well-known examples of research malpractice that happened before the Holocaust (J. Marion Sims, the Tuskeegee experiment), and some after (many DoD experiments on the public during the Cold War).
@disco_socialist There are other full-access plans that would have presented Carrie's death without being M4A. Single payer solutions, or even just more regulation of insurance.		That said, M4A would definitely do the trick &amp; you're right to call into question the funding priorities.
@whitequark mindfulness therapy?
@ConnorSouthard That's like 1/2 of a deck at one of the hundreds of golf courses the DoD operates worldwide.
@Pietro5266 @JamesFourM @realDonaldTrump I hope this analysis is right, but the amount of red-faced rage at Cohen's public hearing did not help my confidence.		We need more people on the GOP side to be like @justinamash.
@RioSlade @HongPong You'd think so, but you'd be wrong. The post-WWII consensus on medical ethics is always endangered, that's all.		https://t.co/psiIBCRIvH
@petridishes tbh I'd skip Richard III, it's not McKellen's finest work and the vehicle casting is just execrable. Do like the part where he falls into flames to Al Jolson, tho.		Richard IV, on the other hand...
@Pietro5266 @JamesFourM @realDonaldTrump I don't know. The inertia against charging Trump, and the spectacle of Jordan and Meadows filing a complaint with the DOJ against Cohen, has me thinking the GOP isn't going to respect the law.
@GOP @IvankaTrump Fighting for the right to be proud of yourself while also starving because the @GOP sure as hell ain't fighting for you!		Better dead than red, right Mr. Red Elephant? ;)
@HongPong @RioSlade IMO, the line you're attempting to draw straight from the Nazi era to the modern era is alarming. There was a lot of soul searching in Germany &amp; medicine.		What's chilling about Bayer is not that it is an ex-Nazi affiliate, but that these things happened despite that history.
@SavageJoyMarie1 @VerminSupreme @RealProgressUS But...ffFacebook...sadface :(		I will be there in spirit though.

@DavidLWink @SOS911Venezuela @RepTedDeutch Hi. You are aware that a recent mass shooter was able to buy a firearm because the local police decided not to send their record into the national database? This is the kind of thing that I would hope all people could agree is bad.
@Sherrod4POTUS @rasputinmethod @politijack @NateSilver538 Yup. That's why in a sane world people would be going for Sherrod. I don't see the need to push all the way to possible disaster at the start - pushing slowly doesn't necessarily mean capitulation on the merits of #M4A, but it would give us a working system that could go further.

@pammaysmcdonald @WesleyLowery @JamilahLemieux The idea that you have to be Martin Luther King, Jr. to explain what racism is has been disproven by the abuse of his own words by racists.		I think she could have put it more artfully, sure. Woulda, shoulda, coulda. Ultimately white America has to take responsibility.

@maxo531 @YimbyA @mattyglesias Not taking sides, but that does seem to be a point of confusion.
@YimbyA @maxo531 @mattyglesias That's kind of what I'm driving at. It's not as clear as a discussion of money as a behavioral modifier, but there's definitely a kind of psychic cost to urban density overall. I don't really relish the thought of becoming an irritable New Yorker. Then again, sprawl is bad.
@JohnCarltonKing @xeni 2028 puts us 2/3 of the way to the climate change deadline, though. We gotta get stuff done in the next 8 years.
@YimbyA @maxo531 @mattyglesias Back roads remain uncongested, but any roads leading into city centers quickly become bumper-to-bumper hells (at least from the MI perspective). It's probably more efficient but I think there's an emotional cost to it. (Of course, there's also costs to having unused roads).
@KateRothwell @OsitaNwanevu OK, I'll bite...what's this "ordoImeanAnalogy" you speak of? I looked up "ordolmean" and was highly disappointed to find no references to obscure Catholic orders. Not even a Cathar one!
@OsitaNwanevu On balance, I think I'll stick to eating watermelons.
@OsitaNwanevu It's the reverse of Sebastian Gorka's head, which is somewhat reddish outside and full of rotted brains.
@ReverendLars @AnnaKareninaXX @ClenchedFisk @MollyJongFast ...and that's a sign of brain disease
@YimbyA @maxo531 @mattyglesias That said, congestion fees seem like a form of gentrification, not to mention an inefficient way of collecting the funding taxes. Admittedly, I don't have an answer for what would be a "better" system, including simple state decrees or lotteries (as some other countries use).
@YimbyA @maxo531 @mattyglesias The practice of anti-congestion rules is new to me, having returned from 30 years in Michigan where road funding and maintenance was a joke. The congestion in the Shenandoah Valley is no joke, and feels worse than places much closer to DC did 30 years before.
@MoveOn #POTUS should be out there sharing this important message and counteracting the nationalist, hypersensitive rhetoric being broadcast by media in the two countries. We can and should help promote voices for peace!
@YimbyA @maxo531 @mattyglesias Well, that's a lot to disentangle. Tax-supported infrastructure is not an "unpriced" model, which is the suggestion implicit in such a term. If someone pays their taxes but doesn't have the dollar for a toll one day, how is that equitable? It's a regressive taxation scheme.

@mattyglesias @MattZeitlin This sounds like a grant proposal rather than a serious attempt to understand the situation. Just follow Studs Terkel and ask people why they moved left!
@MattZeitlin People who were watching the news in 2008 were acutely aware that rent-seeking behaviors and wealth agglomeration were a factor in both the crisis and wider inequality. You need to distinguish the cases more.
@YimbyA @maxo531 @mattyglesias There's a popular phrase used in a different arena - "equality of opportunity, not equality of outcomes." Equalizing opportunities is a goal of government and mass transit is one of the fundamental arenas.		Many cities have ample space for expansion, but a deficit of will.
@JohnCarltonKing @chrislhayes @IlhanMN Yeah, but I think Chris is talking about the media pandering to this double standard. We just went through this five times last month, seems like.
@TdocDougherty @1a @tyseymour Any group that doesn't emphasize looking for the facts, and instead relies on dogma and tribal affiliation, is doomed.
@YimbyA @maxo531 @mattyglesias I will give you off-peak pricing, if it is a discount, as a way to boost ridership. However it is not access-boosting. I do realize that economists want to challenge people to be creative with their hours, but scheduling work in off hours is simply a non-starter for most workers.

@INeedABeerOrTwo @Stevietheman66 @GeorgeTakei Can't disagree.
@GeorgeTakei We've only been waiting 10+ years for this moment! In the meanwhile, illegal activities in Israel have continued unchecked and the PM has sided with the radical racist right.
@YimbyA @mattyglesias This still sidesteps the major issue, which is that access to public infrastructure should be egalitarian.		In practice, toll roads act as a way to offset the failure to fund infrastructure properly through taxes, and is a form of regressive taxation.
@tedlieu @realDonaldTrump The problem is that Trump doesn't define service to the country the way you do, Ted! His pattern of treachery &amp; believing foreign adversaries needs to fail.		Beyond that I agree with your sentiment. But he needs to fail right into the hoosegow!
@JesusOfNaz316 I spent a lot of time in recess detention with one kid who said it was a step up from the previous Christian school he'd been at, where he'd been caned.		The upperclassmen who liked wrecking shit &amp; throwing pencils into the ceiling tiles never got detention that I knew of.
@JesusOfNaz316 I went to a Christian school around the age of 10. I wrote my favorite band was Devo (I liked the hats), pointed out to one of my teachers that the Piltdown Man hoax did not disprove evolution (as the printed curricula suggested), and wandered around outside for 1/2 hour one day

@mattyglesias Congestion pricing is probably unpopular because its central prescription - price people out of access - goes against the egalitarian intention of mass transit infrastructure, which is to increase access. It's a prime example of economists not caring about the underlying good.
@TdocDougherty @1a @tyseymour I think it's also important to see the general balance of a party: Sometimes the barrel is so rotten that you might as well throw it away and roll out another.
@1a @tyseymour I thought identity politics were bad, according to conservatives?		Wearing tactical crocs in the snow is a choice, after all!

@MrSimmonsSr @BriannaWu The "we don't get to change the laws, come take my gun away" view is simple anarchy.
@MrSimmonsSr @BriannaWu I submit you haven't a clue what you're talking about. The Second Amendment isn't written in stone. It's quite possible we could have an Amendment to change it. Or, y'know, we could just start with what I've been suggesting and stop ignoring the regulations on the books.
@MrSimmonsSr @BriannaWu Ah yes, you're such a calm and trustworthy individual.		Your beloved NRA &amp; talking heads have stymied attempts to keep guns out of the hands of toddlers &amp; maniacs. That's totally on you, and you aren't driving the bus anymore.		If you had sense you would've gotten ahead of that.
@mehdirhasan Not to knock on your critique of the news reporting, but we definitely need to be focused on the #GND too.
@1a @mschlapp These guys aren't the future of anything. It's a fully metastasized cult and the American people shouldn't have to put up with minority government. 2020's all about building coalitions to show these small fellows the exit.

@MrSimmonsSr @BriannaWu I'm not even comfortable with the idea of restricting gun sales but what did the precious NRA do? Nothing, it just scared y'all into thinking that the gun grabbers were coming so you had to buy more guns - and also got in the way of comprehending the issues &amp; policy fixes.
@MrSimmonsSr @BriannaWu All you've done is issue barely veiled threats of violence because somebody pointed out that intermediate caliber rifles are a risk factor. Oh, and that regurgitated NRA non-sequitur that blames victims for their deaths, that's classy too!
@MrSimmonsSr @BriannaWu Oh, and your regurgitated NRA talking points are a gift from the Almighty? It was very clear that she was talking about the ability to put a large volume of aimed fire downrange, and you've not even acknowledged that is the very reason why this weapon is used by mass killers.

@jfkeeler Single-payer or bust. Absolutely no reason for insurance companies to be playing this way.
@MrSimmonsSr @BriannaWu Did I suggest such a thing?

@MrSimmonsSr @BriannaWu *Automatic firearms, natural typo. From the standpoint of a spree killer, automatic fire would likely have little appeal. Semiautomatic fire allows controlled fire against multiple targets, and when those targets aren't shooting back that is clearly the natural mode.
@MrSimmonsSr @BriannaWu She's not necessarily talking about semiautomatic firearms, and yes, second amendment fans ought to get with the program and come to grips with the general argument against intermediate-caliber carbines capable of a high volume of fire.
@aaronjmate @BuzzFeedBen That a single breath was wasted in hearings on dispelling such a bizarre lie augurs badly for democracy.
So Twitter: After the @GOP's failure to process yesterday's expectedly explosive testimony, how are you feeling about the prospects of impeachment before the election?		Myself, not so great. We'll see DOJ stonewall to protocol, and NYC charges dismissed as political.

@MrSimmonsSr @BriannaWu The phrase "or one like it" wishes to have words with you! It was an uphill battle just to get bump stocks banned. As far as killing potential goes, mass shooters have unfortunately demonstrated that semiautomatic rifles based on the Armalite platform are deadly to groups.

@GeigerNews @DearAuntCrabby @realDonaldTrump @JohnWDean In contrast, Cohen was involved in smear campaigns against individuals and was paid money for facilitating coverups - and that's just what is known publicly.		The roles are similar in a very broad sense but let's not forget who Cohen really is.
@GeigerNews @DearAuntCrabby @realDonaldTrump @JohnWDean did, as far as I know, serve President Nixon in covering-up Watergate, asked for a pardon for doing so, and continued to work in that capacity while secretly helping investigators
@DonCheadle Harris needs to face a penalty for hiring this guy despite being told not to do so by his attorney son. How he might get to run again is beyond me. Don't think the NC Rep. party is going to bat for him based on what they said before, but disowning him isn't enough.

@leahmcelrath @joshorton I tend to discount the "Russian troll" theory of the hateful Berner because we've seen ample examples of this kind of thing being countenanced by people in the campaign or its close orbit. However, we also know that hostile actors are working to dynamite US democracy.
@leahmcelrath @joshorton At this point, I have to wonder at the intentions of the people doing such things.		Perhaps they are hoping (foolishly) for a minority government (and minority coalitions don't really work in the US non-parliamentary system). Perhaps they are seeking to damage Bernie.

@eisenlohr_moul And on that note, are works like Sarah Blaffer Hrdy's "Mother Nature" still in good academic repute? It seems to me she was headed in the right direction (and a lot of that book seems to go straight to the point being made here, it's not all about male selection / preference).
@eisenlohr_moul Lots of commentators who want to use evolutionary psychology &amp; sociology insights to shape policy (including myself) stumble over pitfalls like these. There's general scientific illiteracy, and then the question of "what conclusions can we really draw from the research?"

@HenryPorters @G_Padraic Well, I'm not arguing to replace a legalistic enlightenment framework with a simply Darwinian one. I'm just saying that context is useful in understanding the origins of moral issues. Plenty of different useful camps on this topic, but going to (modern) sociology is effective.
@patsajak a joke that punches down, eh?
@HenryPorters @G_Padraic We shouldn't fall for a naturalistic fallacy either.		One could simply try to flatten it down into a "crimes against the person" category but I think that ignores the role of sex in human nature too far.
@HenryPorters @G_Padraic Another thing is that enlightened thinking about social issues shouldn't discount the power politics behind them. This is a thorny problem because emotional response to rape not only does but must influence our policy on crime. As you say, we can't reduce away some complexity.
@HenryPorters @G_Padraic I'm talking about tribal &amp; family mechanics. It's not just a human phenomenon, but very similar to what is found in many wild species, including non-ape ones.		One thing I take from it is that people ought to be humble - we're not as advanced as we like to let on.

@HenryPorters @G_Padraic The study of power relations didn't stop with Aristotle, though. Sarah Blaffer Hrdy and other biological / evolutionary sociologists have found ample evidence for it.		Anyhow, the goal I envisioned was to deconflict, reduce emotional tensions, make power more meritocratic.
@ChatByCC @realDonaldTrump @foxandfriends Send a message - that Harris guy needs to go to jail!
@MuslimIQ @CuomoPrimeTime @hardball Grump-checks aside, you're doing good work here. I hope I'm wrong about this, even a little bit wrong.
@MuslimIQ Because this story won't grow the right-wing viewership of media outlets, does not have a glamorous media star at its core (Real James Woods doesn't count, obvs!), I give this story very weak odds of dominating @CuomoPrimeTime or @hardball, let alone the news cycle.
@RogueEvildoer @realDonaldTrump Pretty sure Donarudo-chan wouldn't approve of a Socialist Venezuela even if it were profitable.
@tempest_thunder @G_Padraic This is a good point. The tendency to use victim-controlled factors as a "dis-aggravating factor" in how we view crimes is a broad problem and not, as you point out, the unique province of deliberating on a rape. There can be a constructive dialogue to improve lives, tho!
@HenryPorters @G_Padraic So here is where I think anti-stigmatization can do some heavy lifting. We just need to be clear what it is we are putting a stigma on. Abusing power relationships is a very general category of wrong and is the responsibility of those in a superior position to respect, for ex.
@G_Padraic Yes, I'd agree with that. I just wanted to address this and get it out of the way.
@G_Padraic As for the rest of this, visceral reaction to an act of rape seem more deeply rooted than patriarchy. I would see toxic masculinity more as a sucker vine crawling back down to the roots...it can aggravate things but sex power dynamics aren't a uniquely human phenomenon.
@G_Padraic My first concern is the erosion of due process by attempts to enhance victims' rights. The ACLU and Rep. Joe Kennedy III seemed to imply that accused rapists lose due process. It's understandable not just as patriarchy but can be explained as a reaction to past impunity.

He also talks briefly about the murder of his Post colleague @jamalkhashoggi and the failure of the current US Administration to hold Saudi Arabia accountable. The President doesn't deserve this degree of civility and it's horrible that we so often leave victims fighting alone.

...every bit as much as Thomas Reid's declaration that one could not be angry at a chair, because the only proper objects for anger are mindful objects. David Hume helped cut through some of that extraneous nonsense and I think a good dose of it is called for once again.
...and potential human descendants grown not in 9 months from two parents, but from a scientifically aggregate. Kelly's argument that previous humans were wrong and dumb to "attribute great power and genius even to lifeless totems" is a dead-end for philosophy...
Kelly seems to view one thesis as central to protecting human creativity after AI: If humans concede exclusive control of creativity, then we will have "denigrated ourselves." But it's unclear to me how this argument does much beyond denigrate the unlucky: Animals, AI agents...
(It is also quite strange to me to mention algorithmically generated music's roots, in passing, without referencing The Who's Baba O'Riley.)
Kelly promotes the argument that creativity is "socially embedded" to some prominence, without reflecting on the reality of socially embedded AI. Something of the human is embedded in AI - and the reverse is true too. In general Kelly does little to discuss the "centaur" theory.
I'm mystified as to why Kelly writes about agents and things that are clearly being used by humans (artists, even!) and applies his arguments to those tools, which we all understand to be tools, as if it is an argument against them being considered autonomous agents.
So it seems like nothing other than a sleight-of-hand to argue that even if an AI (or "duplicate human, apparently") produces music better than Bach, "that is only because its music can be judged against a preexisting standard." Throw a child on a desert isle...or program an AI.
"At the moment, a machine can only do something much less interesting than what a person can do." Aside from irrelevancy of how babby is formed, Kelly argues that art is not ahistorical. Is not an isolated, learning machine, or a "novel" human kidnapped to an island historical?
That history is a fascinating topic not covered here. A loss. It's, however, not doing any lifting here; on the contrary Kelly tacitly acknowledges it is perhaps simply not a timely criticism in the next line:
I really can't stress enough how bad and exclusionary that view is. It is followed by this line "At the moment, a machine can only do something much less interesting than what a person can do." AI has a history of failing to reach lofty, popular-centered goals.
"A molecule-for-­molecule duplicate of a human being would be human in the relevant way. But we already have a way of producing such a being: it takes about nine months." Kelly seems to acknowledge the humanity of a 'duplicate' human, but then...tries to qualify that citizenship.
Kelly has his bat ready for errant philosophical zombies &amp; this view may unwittingly harm future humans. Remember the CRISPR-edited babies in the headlines when you read this next segment:
Naturally, I will not be accepting the algorithmic judgment of computers if an artist produces a work with computer generation and I don't like it, or if my bank account is in the red.
"[...] if we know that the output is merely the result of some arbitrary act or algorithmic formalism, we cannot accept it as the expression of a vision for human good." Chaos theory + evolution = we know human history is an output, even "merely the result" of processes.
At this point, Kelly's line of argument is best summarized as a line of (presumably unwitting) attacks on the evolutionary understanding of the origin of humanity. There is apparently something privileged about human history. Ex:
A "toddler [...] is not creative."	Art must present "a vision of what the world should be."	"Algorithms can have moral implications, they are not themselves moral agents." Here Kelly references the monkeys-and-typewriters theory, much better understood in evolutionary frameworks.
What should be a fairly standard emergentist reading is encumbered by special cutouts:	There's no love for artists in the trenches, only "genuinely creative and innovative artist(s)" need apply.	Creativity is "mysterious and impressive."	Creativity is "not just novelty."
I'm confused by @Sean_D_Kelly's recent tendentious, exhausting, no-good article for MIT on "Intelligent Machines." I like to read without preconceptions, but this one doesn't hide its agenda from the byline: "Creativity is, and always will be, a human endeavor."
@LeftwardSwing Reality or not, I think it's past time to reevaluate the policy of excluding prospective voters as "centrist." Let the man campaign for those voters and he might even win!
@SarcasmStardust Something was invented so that you don't have to stop injustices by yourself. It's called "democratic government." It doesn't guarantee results, but it is a fair bit better than yelling at clouds &amp; old men on Twitter.

@MaxAbrahms That's a big lift for the remainder of this term.
@SarcasmStardust It's funny you'd trot that out after you shipped a metric ton of strawmen with your last response. Whether or not you think Bernie's going to fix the problem isn't the issue. You're trying to punish him for not accomplishing ends that his criticism was never meant to.
@SarcasmStardust Shorter you: "I have no plan to fix this and that's fine"
@SarcasmStardust Telling Maduro that he has no responsibility for his leadership is infantilizing, and a form of intellectual colonization. It's hardly being a helpful friend to fellow socialists.		As I keep saying, our skepticism about the aid packages and US aims are best served by Congress.
@Turnip2020 @DonaldJTrumpJr I don't even know who you are, but I think chances are pretty good you're not holding a severed elephant tail right now.

@SarcasmStardust Bernie calling on Maduro to be good to his people is not equivalent to Bernie saying that they should let arms go to the opposition, or that he supports the return of the Reagan neocons.		If Maduro is gonna hang in there, he can address these points easily.
@scott_satzer @MuseWendi A thing @MuseWendi seems to be touching on, and mentioned elsewhere, is that even though Venezuelan socialists were bad politicians, they weren't necessarily the worst, and they sought to empower the poor. President Trump screaming about "socialism" suggests our aims are wrong.
@scott_satzer @MuseWendi The thing is that it should be fairly simple, but thanks to the secretive murder campaigns of the Reagan Admin, it's not. People seem to just want careful diplomacy to promote democracy without coups, but it's easy to be frightened because of the awful history of Admin officials.
@SdeWeger @americamag @gerryorome That reminds me of a related issue: I think the Catholic Church may have a degree of the "NFL problem," where the sheer size and influence of a body makes it hard to know how it's actually doing, outside the media outrage cycle. Other churches may actually be doing worse.
@SdeWeger @americamag @gerryorome Yes, that's true. But the way the Catholic church members are talking around the issue is teeth-grinding aggravation. It should be a given that everybody wants the same thing - of course, in reality, many in the hierarchy weren't practicing.
@LeftwardSwing This is all a long-winded way of saying we need to take a careful diplomatic approach that doesn't make things harder for Maduro or the opposition.
@LeftwardSwing Also, what a lot of the "fair elections" folk are missing is that Maduro has governed terribly, and that's not 100% the fault of "Western interventions." No to forcing aid on the legitimate government, but also no to delegitimizing real domestic opposition.
@LeftwardSwing Abrams and his ilk are clearly not to be trusted, but I'd rather see a Congressional inquiry before I'd trust a bunch of random websites that claim we're arming them.		Folks forget that Maduro wants to bottle up opposition - that would include denying regular aid.
@FructoseNo "That's right: you should be brushing before breakfast, not after." The article's sloppily written and this line is an example - Doc sez brush before breakfast AND after (~3/4 hour). Bonus tonne of medical jargon that the average reader won't be able to digest. @TheTelegraph__
@americamag @gerryorome Continue to scratch my head at these weird proclamations. Does "the dynamic involvement of the whole people of God" sound like "victims first" to anyone? Flattening the bureaucracy should be an obvious solution at this point. There is no justification for the continued secrecy.

@TheTalentWang @FaithFortune99 @AimeeArtigliere @rocketsurgeon76 @BarackObama @IlhanMN @fairvote That's why @AOC and @IlhanMN are kicking ass in Congress, and Jill Stein is doing jack shit, rite?
@TrumpsTies The Rumpler laying a trap for the Beto Blunder and other candidates.		"Rumple me this!"		(just riffin' on the character @BetoORourke, please don't kill me)
@rocketsurgeon76 @FaithFortune99 @AimeeArtigliere @BarackObama @IlhanMN @DNC I'm having trouble understanding your run-on sentence. Is HRC running again? I thought you were just saying that you'd not follow Bernie's lead blindly. I think we're all getting off track if we're going to argue against views nobody holds.
@rocketsurgeon76 @FaithFortune99 @AimeeArtigliere @BarackObama @IlhanMN @fairvote Try not to be lazy and read the convo. I was referring to Jill Stein.		Now, if Bernie does become a "spoiler," I'll ditch him. But I'm willing to give him a fair shake again.
@rocketsurgeon76 @FaithFortune99 @AimeeArtigliere @BarackObama @IlhanMN @fairvote Well, I guess that's a literal answer, thanks for that!
@wynnsworld @530livin @Bravewriting @cluckeryDuckery Just having come out of a "I want my perfect candidates" shitfest, lemme just say this: It's never too early to start pulling for your candidate. That's not racist!
@LittleMissLizz I don't have any text messages.
@AimeeArtigliere Yes, clapping is the problem. Thanks for being the weakest link, Aimee. Goodbye!
@JohnCarltonKing @0rdoLiberalism By becoming fiscal hawks again. Hey, I don't  think Amy's wrong here. Maybe I should be clearer that I think this is something to watch out for. On the other hand, she did make the "too expensive" argument about universal Medicare. Guess you've got to draw the line somewhere...
@AimeeArtigliere @FaithFortune99 @rocketsurgeon76 @BarackObama @IlhanMN @DNC Let's not vote for Trump again.
@JohnCarltonKing @0rdoLiberalism That's the sticking point for me. "Political capital" theory aside, this is going to allow those wealthy interests an opening to divide and conquer.
@AimeeArtigliere @FaithFortune99 @rocketsurgeon76 @BarackObama @IlhanMN @DNC @SpeakerPelosi You're free to look at my feed - I called her out for clapping at the "America will never be socialist" line.		A good thing about democracy (however little we have) is that there's no emperors. :)
@AimeeArtigliere @FaithFortune99 @rocketsurgeon76 @BarackObama @IlhanMN @DNC Of course not. You're not responsible for gravity either. But there's no prizes for voting to ignore it.		If you want to criticize me for promoting working inside the system, that's fine - just show me how you avoid catastrophe on election day.
@AimeeArtigliere @FaithFortune99 @rocketsurgeon76 @BarackObama @IlhanMN @DNC Oh, good. For a moment I was afraid you were going to say you were always consistent. Let's not vote in Trump again, yeah?
@amyklobuchar In a day when @GOP saw fit to lie about the origin of illegal heroin, we deserve better - and here it is.		Is the GOP afraid of the Sacklers too?
@Randy12967819 @brendankmurphy @MollyJongFast @chrislhayes All that money, and his folks wouldn't buy a better film. Good show!
@rocketsurgeon76 @FaithFortune99 @AimeeArtigliere @BarackObama @IlhanMN @fairvote Obvious follow-through: If Bernie throws in the towel, will you follow his lead and support the candidate he chooses?
@rocketsurgeon76 @FaithFortune99 @AimeeArtigliere @BarackObama @IlhanMN @fairvote That's why I support Bernie's right to run. I voted for him in '16 and if he is the candidate I'll vote for him again!
@SwiftOnSecurity But...is this correct?
@AimeeArtigliere @FaithFortune99 @rocketsurgeon76 @BarackObama @IlhanMN @DNC @DWStweets There's a growing socialist wing of the party represented like @AOC. Your solution is to strangle that by throwing support to cocktail party activists like Stein? nthx.
@FaithFortune99 @AimeeArtigliere @rocketsurgeon76 @BarackObama @IlhanMN Fyi, I voted for Bernie. He lost.		I'll give him a second chance this time! No poison pills here.
@KEBrightbill Riding a bike over a 7 foot stone wall from the top.		Not a scratch even though I didn't have any kind of landing.
@AimeeArtigliere @FaithFortune99 @rocketsurgeon76 @BarackObama @IlhanMN @DNC I speak to the logic of the system. I'm not sitting here going "oh boy, I can't think of anything better than gambling everything on a candidate I know won't win.		It's getting tiresome repeating this, just like your off-topic tirades.
@mattyglesias Just think of all the potential efficiencies!		tfw matty doesn't want to cover onboard washrooms, tho
@FaithFortune99 @AimeeArtigliere @rocketsurgeon76 @BarackObama @IlhanMN Agreed with everything up to the last part.		@AimeeArtigliere: If you give a damn then you ought to be looking at ways to get your policies a chance. There's @fairvote and a million things more sensible than Nader 2.0.		Gambling everything on the election? Part of the problem.
@RRangel4JC @amyklobuchar I wonder if this is the right approach too. Rather than a solution that helps people take control of their working lives, it's easy for companies to justify eliminating the wage altogether.		To be fair, I think if something's worth paying for, it's worth paying a good wage.
@escapedmatrix People aren't rioting because they're too busy on the treadmill for billionaires, sadly.		America really needs more leisure time to get stuff done &amp; clear our collective heads.
@GOP How's that investigation of the Sacklers going?
@AimeeArtigliere @FaithFortune99 @rocketsurgeon76 @BarackObama Ask @IlhanMN if she joined the Dem party because she thought the Greens were going to fix that.		Nobody's saying you can't be further left than the Dem party. But voting for Stein or Nader in the general was only justifiable if you wanted to burn everything down.
@AimeeArtigliere @FaithFortune99 @rocketsurgeon76 @BarackObama What's "wrong" is that we all knew Trump was going to be worse, and he was. He ramped up the drone war and put many more kids in cages.		Stein isn't running to govern but to dine out off her donors and Russia. It's easy to criticize others when you've got no record.
@notcapnamerica lol
@FaithFortune99 Really don't understand how you veer from retweeting "policy goes first" from @rocketsurgeon76 to "I voted for Stein because HRC bad" from @AimeeArtigliere		Not having Ranked Choice Voting sucks but that's what we have to contend with. HRC never put kids in cages
@AimeeArtigliere @JesusWasARebel2 @DrJillStein @HillaryClinton Boy, it sure is a good thing you voted for that borscht-drinker and kept Trump out of the White House
@EJDionne I'm not sure this is a very good analogy. Corbyn gleefully milked Article 50 for advantage but never put a policy forward. The people who left the party seem to have been the trailing right-edge of the party; of course they would be the first defectors.

@clairlemon @Noahpinion Heartwarming to see somebody actually accept evidence in this day and age! :)
@Only4RM @chrislhayes It really goes much earlier than that. 2000 cult hit videogame Deus Ex drew upon a lot of the conspiracy theory threads the right still reveres, including armed occupation by the UN.		FEMA camps belief goes back to the 1970s.	https://t.co/BoIK1ikNDq
@brendankmurphy @MollyJongFast @chrislhayes Huh. It's just like our great Commander-In-Cheap to take what he claims is a sacred spot, and put a golf course right on it. Wonder if he would mind people doing some metal detecting for remnants of the battle?		Once he loses that golf course, that plaque's getting crowbared off.
@chrislhayes The right wing got off on the wrong foot by deciding to die on hills like gun rights and "abortion" in years past. Since that time, they've taken the Clarence Thomas view: We can't have nice things, but at least we can have independence. They refuse to budge, from fear &amp; laziness
@RWPUSA @alfranken The funny thing is that right-wingers have been making this claim for years. I think that we can and should all be aware that higher standards are going to be the new norm. I agree we shouldn't try to micro-police things, but Al's conduct was bad.		Gotta draw the line somewhere.

@RogueEvildoer @moonbeamstar12 Boxes of evidence in bare concrete cells. I wouldn't be surprised if part of the historical guardianship goes to the library of the next President - like how the Ford library covers Watergate and has one of the infamous tape recorders on display.
@Edr351 @AnandWrites @rcbregman @TuckerCarlson I'm kind of disgusted that @TuckerCarlson has sold his soul for just $16 million dollars. You can't get fresh with only that much. Gotta aim higher, at least $100 million will let you do a real mansion or some good charity to soothe your guilt.
@JohnCarltonKing @Patrickesque I think that he could be sincere about this, technically correct on a narrow matter, and repeating a dog whistle, all simultaneously.		It's useless and lazy too. We need to push beyond this and ask Bernie why he isn't talking about taking the simple steps to fix the problem.
@JamilSmith My only guess is that he was thinking he had a platform to expose abuses. It is the dark mirror image of Adolf Hitler on the steps of the Reichstag, exclaiming "God grant that it was the Communists" and seeing the potential to destroy his enemies.
@JamilSmith Conspiracy theorists and false-flag lovers have a long history of abusing such hoaxes. Since the right-wing got a sniff of the hoax potential of this story, they've been using it to attack not only survivors, but also civil rights &amp; progressive causes.
@Looks_Confused @DrJenGunter In plain English: People who want to think logically should make a habit of identifying the subjective from the objective. An argument about subjective matters is hard to resolve formally, but an argument about facts is usually simple to resolve formally.
@Looks_Confused @DrJenGunter Colloquially, it's called "the exception to the rule." She's providing counterexamples, which work because we assume the opposing case is falsifiable.		Your stipulation that the counterexample is "extreme" is, as you noted, subjective, and thus not a part of the formal syllogism.

@NewDay @jccruzchellew Who will watch the watchers? Outside organizations need to stop giving private groups the benefit of the doubt when they don't police themselves. The Church is only exceptional due to its size, not its moral leadership.
A point in light of the #covingtonboys free speech suppression lawsuit against the @washingtonpost. The objective of suing the WaPo is not just money; it's to force the left to retreat from defending civil rights.		Thankfully we have the First Amendment &amp; NYT v. Sullivan. https://t.co/lr1nPCejtu
@CNN @whignewtons hit the ground running!		Fun fact: @JohnDelaney's archived account @repjohndelaney points to a nonexistent account, @JohnKDelaney.
@AllisonLHedges @JohnDelaney Dear Sir, what u doin
@NativeApprops Worst strategy to force a public discussion about trial by media ever, and the fact that high profile swamp creatures push this as brilliance shows their lack of respect for law.
@Artists_Ali Send somebody a bill before you check you've billed the right entity, get a bill in your mailbox. It's only fair; there oughta be a law.
@NativeApprops It's even possible that the WaPo defense asks for attorney's fees and is awarded them.		There's a reason the horrible attorney behind this chose only the biggest pot of gold. If they went after the other citizens threatened with a lawsuit the bullying &amp; greed would be more stark.
@NativeApprops It doesn't matter what lessons the Covington defenders want to ignore or how much money they demand. Unless Associate Justices Thomas, Gorsuch, and Alito want to shred NYT v. Sullivan, and are joined by 2 more, they are going to be sent home empty-handed.
@Rob_O_Fish @KidsWriteJokes We've failed our children.

@FChev22 @MaxAbrahms Isn't this the reverse of what happened, really?		My critique of Assad has never been that he was easy on terror groups. That his methods are brutal is besides the point.
@puredouglas @SimonMaloy Was all over the news yesterday:		https://t.co/2vEdgyWFs4
@RealJamesWoods Instead of having a frank discussion about the rush to judgment, the Covington Boys are putting them through the grinder again. The attorney has already tried a similar case in the past, and already lost bigly. Trump's got no skin in this game and can't do anything for them.
@RealJamesWoods How to break this news gently...		The only way they can win is if 5 justices lose their minds and vote to repeal Sullivan at the Supreme Court. That would allow states to sue newspapers outta existence. You sure you want states policing free speech?

@Cancun771 @joshtpm I see! How do we square away the radioactivity readings they mention? Could this actually be another material, like Cobalt or Plutonium?
@Popehat https://t.co/KRajDzJdkN
@PA_MI_Resistor @CNN Jokes aside, it's a small town paper with an ordinary name. People like this could be hiding behind every bush or rock.		I wonder how we can find them?
@Cancun771 @joshtpm That's unrefined uranium. This was refined and they reportedly have readings.
@joshtpm @azcentral Missed that it was refined earlier - uh oh, that's bad.		Add this to the Boring But Important list: A wide-scale sweep for loose radioactive materials and an accounting of materials produced by refineries.
@cholent_lover @RussiawithoutBS Fine. What's your goal here? Why are you doing this? Help me understand.
@RussiawithoutBS @cholent_lover What the flying hell is going on in here anyway? Surely we can all fight fascism and antisemitism without resorting to "blood libels" against other ethnic groups. Seems like a diversionary tactic to me.
@rtroez @mikeyfranklin @AdamParkhomenko Shocking report. This is why we need candidates to tell us more about who they are actually going to hire, and why we need to do everything possible to whittle down the number of people paid to campaign but not working in bureaucracy or as activist allies - i.e., fighting for #1.
@Mark_J_Perry @donmoyn That almost makes it sound as if Ruth Bader-Ginsburg would go to bat for you in the S.C., but isn't this an affirmative action issue, really?

As for the campaign, let's all work on getting #orangeisachoice out of the WH and having a good debate about the best policies, the best cabinet and as much winning as possible!
@mattyglesias @MattZeitlin Been holding off watching that one until I've got one... :o
@george_capen Sideline: It's interesting how people who used to think Clinton shouldn't be impeached will now defend Trump, but people who did support impeachment now say it's inappropriate. All are welcome at the Winter White House!

@cricketcrocker I'll have to look at it. I just think that some of the Indigenous backlash against DNA destiny belief is counter-productive.		For now, I think I ought to stop derailing your commentary :) I can vent anytime, but fresh impressions of talks are important to note down. Any video?
@NPR Let me echo @brutapologist and say that the guidelines on reporting from police statements should change. When the police chief himself calls this a bad raid, calling the victims "suspects" seems obtuse - even if they were suspected of dealing heroin.
@cricketcrocker Sorry, this is something I should look at and not vent in your TL about :)		I'm just tired that we're still talking about DNA.
@PaleoPhil @MaxAbrahms Hmm, can't argue against that.

@DanDanTransient @NativeApprops @TwitchHollow Hey, maybe the question wasn't just asking the questioned to set himself up for an ad hominem. But even if somebody puts limits on what they want to share, you can still have a discussion, or a public shaming.
@DanLamothe Hunker down and wait for the storm to pass. Unfortunately it seems the Services aren't immune from the gales.
@DanDanTransient @NativeApprops @TwitchHollow It's worth noting that I was told in a different discussion that "all Cherokee" are on the same page about these things, as a matter of definition rather than inquiry. Clearly, this isn't the case.
@DanDanTransient @NativeApprops @TwitchHollow I see what you're getting at, but it seemed to me the question was setting up just 2 possibilities:	1.) Dan is wrong because he doesn't know	2.) Dan is wrong because he's not native		So...just say he's wrong to start with and you don't want to talk about it.
@DanDanTransient @NativeApprops @TwitchHollow That's exactly what I took issue with.		A scientist has to know what they're doing. There is not some magical property about the label "climatologist" that makes a person an expert. In fact, there are climatologists who deny climate change. They are criticized for their views.
@DanDanTransient @NativeApprops @TwitchHollow Since it's unclear now, let me just refrain: I'm not going to bat for Dan's rant against tone policing. I sympathize with him, but don't approve of what he said generally.
@DanDanTransient @NativeApprops @TwitchHollow Your premise is that you're not a biologist, which is not the premise I'm working from. I'm not the one trying to police people's right to have an opinion based on their identity.		I also don't think you'll find many biologists or climatologists who are being harmed by jokes.
@drvox It could help, but as you say, it's not the most promising or effective strategy available in 2019.
@drvox The carbon tax was an interesting, promising idea back in 1981.		Today, industry is still heavily dependent on carbon and there's little progress being made. If they're all deep in the red on carbon, just trading that debt around won't make it go away.
@CostanzaaGeorge @BethLynch2020 We all gotta chill out and let the candidates speak!
@DanDanTransient @NativeApprops @TwitchHollow But if we put that shoe on the other foot, would you take kindly to somebody asking you to justify your opinions by revealing your identity, or any other thing?
@livingpotato @Trillburne @Susan_Hennessey This is it to me. We can talk about how Bernie labels himself but ultimately the policies we're all talking about are on a continuum, unless somebody thinks that millennial power is going to bring about a socialist revolution. I'm all for using a fulcrum when making a hard lift.
@KristenClarkeJD @CNN and other news outlets need to find some time to report on this story blowing wide open.

@MrSimmonsSr @RepMarciaFudge Alright, thanks for the clarification.		All I can imagine is that she's talking about people who are not able to get an ID easily, or being disenfranchised in some other way.		If I was on that panel I would not be impressed with that answer, tho.
@MollyMcKew Hater gonna hate. I think that's Stone's SOP.		Strange comment thread as I find myself "liking" comments giving the opposite answers, a very rare thing.
@MrSimmonsSr @RepMarciaFudge Somebody who actually knows the law has to chime in here. Her comment seems sloppy and a background check seems onerous - but Georgia has sometimes purged rolls &amp; delayed registration.		Doesn't look like a really helpful answer to me though.

@HongPong @ishaantharoor @WritersofColour @MaxAbrahms seems to think this is a good idea.		Seems ex-post-facto to me, and more likely to provoke yet more hatred for the West, not tamp it down.
@Bill43111 @SethAbramson This sounds like a really bad idea. Could you imagine doing quarterly reports on a mob investigation? You release a quarter of your information, and your sources are dead.
@JohnCarltonKing @Noahpinion @ejkalafarski Unfortunately I just have it in paperback. "Inside the System" by Washington Monthly. You might be able to get it at these places:	https://t.co/Mt2YkNoZu2	https://t.co/Ir6qsNBbhF
@SethAbramson @donnabrazile was on @cspan a few days ago and said that we'd be getting Mueller's report in "a couple weeks." This is strange and it's starting to look like a rumor is being passed around. I'm not expecting a leak given the extension.
@JohnCarltonKing @Noahpinion @ejkalafarski Not sure I'd bite on defederalization. Local groups often fall prey to roving gangs of infrastructure bandits - I referenced an article from 1970s on this issue before in this thread. ("The Highwaymen" by D. Hapgood.)
@JamilSmith @dwallacewells @Noahpinion #IoT, #smartappliances, i- and e- and Green and Dongle and every other computerized thing is primarily pushed to make a company money, not save the environment. New stuff is good, but not when it just boosts emissions and waste.
@JamilSmith @dwallacewells The consumerist advocate angle isn't even green. If I buy a new hybrid, I've blown my 12 years of greenhouse gases up the stack at a factory before I've driven off the dealer's lot. @Noahpinion has pointed out that factories are huge and we don't have a policy to decarbonize.
@PalmerReport As a Bernie primary voter, I had to a laugh at this "nihlistic loons who blew smoke up his ass" :)		We've got a chance at a "do-over" and we need to learn. Bernie isn't showing signs of reigning in the toxic elements of his base. He's got to contend with a stronger field too.
@nycsouthpaw Careerist Republicans at the FBI sought to protect evidence from a President they could not trust. That's a hell of a thing, isn't it?
@RebeccaRHelm It sounds like you've got their right interests at heart. A lot of things to teach in only a few years :) In my opinion, it's dangerous if academic politics &amp; funding soak up too much attention. It's like student athletes who are not paid while a university profits off them.
@MLNY @leahmcelrath @mysticrose29 @librarycongress I've called (semi-jokingly) for nationalizing Twitter, but it's good to be reminded that we already have good working programs - we've just not been sticking by them.
@JohnCarltonKing We should shift focus to lifetime learning, including 'sabbaticals for the ordinary worker' so they can actually take part. Four-year programs aren't even optimal for learning, but they are great for networking with fellow rich kids.
@waynepoopsinAK @SethAbramson I think he's doing good work here. Up to us to help get the word out. Up to old media to get the word out, too.
@JamilSmith I don't know what's going on. Wouldn't it be simpler and better just to say "I'm here to promote the policies best for the American people, and make sure they get a say?"
@MLNY @leahmcelrath @mysticrose29 He can certainly still influence and police the tone of his followers a bit, even call on them publicly when they step out of line - remember the holdouts from 2016?		It's hard to know how much is really dirty tricks, but I'm guessing it's less than you might believe.
@RepMarciaFudge What are the steps to buy a firearm in Georgia? (The easiest, obviously.)		I see: 18 or older, no felony, present photo ID.		All those rules apply to voting too, right?
@SimonMaloy @CNNPolitics, who do you work for? https://t.co/F78sfxr6vz
@MLNY @leahmcelrath @mysticrose29 You know what they say, though - "The buck stops here!"
@ncforlife34 This reminds me that the DAR, Daughters of the American Revolution, marginalized blacks for years, even though the first victim of the war was Crispus Attucks.
@RebeccaRHelm Bad reply, I mean "further thoughts." It's clear you're talking about this. I'm asking about the need for faculty / tenured to realize the need to turn their leadership into freeing their students.
@RebeccaRHelm Powerful and true-to-life. Did you have any thoughts on how faculty tend to shift students to their camp? It's fine for students to want to learn under a particular theory or expert, but the power imbalance can drag people from their passion. This reinforces academic silos.
@petersagal @bessbell You really gonna blow your one guess like this? (:
@TheDreamGhoul *stebs with knife made of jellos*
@brianbeutler @nycsouthpaw Most ironic use of the word "deconfliction" I've seen yet :)
@alilmascara @stellaaaa I don't agree, but some people actually evaded the draft because they didn't want to go kill Vietnamese. Many others got over there and simply did their best not to kill. There's always many opinions on how to best resist or serve the public good, including serving.
@MLNY @mysticrose29 @leahmcelrath We can't discount the fact that white guys like to remain on top of the heap. You can support many of Bernie's policies, but at the end still believe in putting yourself ahead of others.		Some soul-searching among Berners is needed. We can't blame it all on Schultz and Russians.
@hollyotterbein It's going to be a problem if Schultz packs up his toys and leaves, or if all the other candidates get on board.		Love Bernie, but you gotta stand out to be President! It's going to be all about what people are saying come Election Day.
@llw902 It kicks out everybody who's not a man. Bernie supporters don't help their candidate when they practice looking like a white mob.
@sandismithusa @mmfa Lou Dobbs is in fully entrenched rube mode. Dems need to highlight that Trump has broken his promises to voters, and make clear that he's only fighting for himself.
@JohnCarltonKing @Alex__Katz A candidate who can take that emotional appeal, divorce it from the failure and criminal contempt for law, and present policies that will actually fulfill Trump's broken promises, is a candidate to watch.
@JohnCarltonKing @Alex__Katz The constant wash of news about racism, failure, and treason from this Administration causes many people to forget that Trump had a strong thesis. He had crowds in tears by empathizing with them over America's decline - and built them up with #MAGA.
@Suits2overalls @Individual1Pod @RepJohnYarmuth @Zigmanfreud @SpeakerPelosi @SenSchumer @RepAdamSchiff @POTUS @realDonaldTrump @DonaldJTrumpJr @FoxNews @GOP Presidents who are #winning routinely win legislation worth billions of dollars. The only thing Trump cared about was ripping off the taxpayers, cutting your refund and Social Security, and pissing off @AnnCoulter. None of his wins will last. #ItTakesTrump
@Suits2overalls @Individual1Pod @RepJohnYarmuth @Zigmanfreud @SpeakerPelosi @SenSchumer @RepAdamSchiff @POTUS @realDonaldTrump @DonaldJTrumpJr @FoxNews President Trump created a debate on border security - but never was smart enough to declare victory, and ended up creating a huge voting bloc of opponents of such plans.		President Trump and the @GOP gambled everything on the wall - and he's going to be gone by 2020.
@JohnCarltonKing @Alex__Katz With climate change and possible medicare expansions on the line, though, can the king of coal country outfox his base?		Perhaps this is really just highlighting the need for the Dems to focus on the Rust Belt and coal country.
@aasian Any country that can electrocute a child can put children in cages. Any country that can put children in cages is dangerously close to electrocuting children.

@Cirincione We're going to vote in a good President and we're going to get the bus started again. People who promote nuclear arms control through anarchy, like John Bolton, shouldn't be driving policy.
@pixelpreaching It's also astonishing to consider today: John Wayne moaned about taxes and lazy people a lot - but he supported work welfare. He was a John Bircher, but he said of JFK, "I didn't vote for him but he's my president, and I hope he does a good job."
@pixelpreaching My great-grandpa didn't like Wayne; Wayne took a handout from the government to not plant crops.		Wayne had a ranch.
@OsitaNwanevu Does Bernie support abolishing the Senate (and expanding representation in the House)?
@brinstar9 I'll be watching this carefully too. Thanks for the reminder!
@MaeveReston @amyklobuchar @CNN This immediately raises two more questions: What's wrong with 4 year degrees and trades? Lifetime learning seems like a proper policy for a strong country, and we can look into new ways of carrying it out. Secondly, what are the policies worth more than higher Ed?
@owenrumney You went from impersonation to stalker, guess that's improvement enough for @jack
@SolomonAtlee @PreetBharara What is it with people saying "your dog looks like X?" Some crazy old people in an apartment once said "your dog looks like a goat." Well, um, gee, thanks?
@araykopo @PreetBharara @Margarita1212 On chains, around his ankles?
@ChiefDimpin @DrJenGunter This is the sticking point. Is Bernie running for his platform, like he did in 2016? I think the answer is yes, but Bros often seem to miss this point, like those that boycotted HRC did. But I don't see proof this is actually the view of Bernie's supporters.
@brinstar9 I don't yet see any estimates as to how many of the "Bernie Bros" there still are. Support for his policies shouldn't automatically be discounted as appeasement.		Bern himself should set the example - his role shouldn't be to burn down the party and he should tell his supporters.

@NatashaBertrand DMK: DEATH MEDIA KILL		good job, stony :/
@speakeazy_ @caramumfordfilm All that being said, I'm sorry for dragging the black community and innocent bystanders into this. But it's hard to talk about things logically without respect for logical ground rules.
@sarahkliff That's really scary. As a society we need to work on streamlining things so that the bureaucracy doesn't grind people down - that's not a partisan issue.		You can't just politically own something when it makes you money.
@titlecharacter @sarahkliff Yeah, article says Zanders, not Sanders.
@speakeazy_ @caramumfordfilm We should be able to recognize the bias towards people who "pass" getting a stronger position if we engage in ad hominems, intentionally or not.
@speakeazy_ @caramumfordfilm That's not my motive and it's just as important we don't engage in "gotcha" debates that misrepresent people's actual views.		As I said elsewhere, maybe I misread things.
@bluecanoeDan @dasharez0ne Funne Facbtt: German-descent Americans had their German-speaking beaten out of them by the Great War.		Now we can't read Shakespeare in the original German :(		https://t.co/BwL617Ws3u
@Haole_Bill @robrousseau @OsitaNwanevu This is one sharp point of departure, but it's unclear to me whether Bernie himself really believes that a break with capitalism is workable. I think it's the tension (between public &amp; private spheres, for ex.) that we need to pay attention to; I don't see a sharp break working.
@OsitaNwanevu Are Bernie's Bros &amp; Bernettes (?) motivated primarily by Bernie's critiques, or the leftist movement? By a critique of the Dem Party, or the system in general?		I think it's the 2nd option in both cases, but sparks fly when these things intersect. I think Bern himself is careful.

@caramumfordfilm @plainsrover @NativeApprops @TwitchHollow @ewarren Finally, if the Delaware Chief has some disagreements with the Cherokee policies, that's a sign that things need to be discussed in private. (https://t.co/dNqblRA1Mp I wasn't quickly able to find any Delaware Tribe folks on Twitter; they are on Facebook, which I don't use.)
@caramumfordfilm @plainsrover @NativeApprops @TwitchHollow @ewarren I always promote people should talk with each other. @ewarren shoulda talked to Cherokee leadership, if she didn't. But that can go both ways, too, and I think the Cherokee would do well to be welcoming of people who are not bad. She could be the most pro-Indigenous candidate.
@caramumfordfilm @plainsrover @NativeApprops @TwitchHollow I saw Chuck Hoskin Jr. go on CNN and say a lot of things that need to be said in the media, and CNN's anchors didn't interrupt or challenge him once! But the occasion was the worst day of @ewarren's political career and Chuck kicked her when she was down. It only benefited Trump.
@caramumfordfilm @plainsrover @NativeApprops @TwitchHollow It's a short walk from political expediency to political necessity :) If Chief Coker was solely looking to score points in international politics, he didn't get universal support from his people.
@Kamaribis @HappiestYogi @AnandWrites @TIME The San Fran. Zuckerberg hospital is also an interesting choice.
@NaomiMac_Ross @NativeApprops @TwitchHollow "I hate or don't hate racism" is a different topic than "claiming to be part / not a part of a targeted group." I think that everybody can police racism and hate crimes, but at the same time I prefer to keep doors open, even to people like Dan. I've met lots of people like Dan.
@ellievan65 Ironically, the hard right's habit of immersing themselves in radical imagery and rhetoric means they are incapable of self-censoring even to save their own skins.

@GeorgeTakei Whoa.		Also, thanks for using your platform for good, sir :) Let's bust some stereotypes!
@MattBors Swing for the fence!
@caramumfordfilm @plainsrover @NativeApprops @TwitchHollow Valid critique of Warren. That which is why I don't do it (despite having been "on the cusp" for much of my life). "Identity" seems stronger than heritage, though.		And with respect to Dan, it's frustrating to see seemingly arbitrary blocks on being allowed to celebrate heritage.
@caramumfordfilm @plainsrover @NativeApprops @TwitchHollow That is the sticking point. I thought I saw Cherokee people claiming that Warren doesn't have a native heritage. But at least some tribally enrolled Delaware, starting with Chief Coker, disagreed with this exclusionary view. So...
@caramumfordfilm @plainsrover @NativeApprops @TwitchHollow I split out ancestry, citizenship, and identity - e.g. one can be adopted with no identity. We know that some Delaware accepted Warren's position that she had Native ancestry (yes, I know why this was problematic) despite her not claiming Delaware citizenship or identity.
@caramumfordfilm @plainsrover @NativeApprops @TwitchHollow But it's not up to Indigenous nations whether to determine whether somebody's arguments are sound or whether they have a personal identity. You can reject it, of course, it's your prerogative.		Anyhow, I don't wish to waste your time.
@dscc Here's my name, you can have it for free for this purpose
@caramumfordfilm @plainsrover @NativeApprops @TwitchHollow Aye, stands to reason. But you could become Manx, right? Not by shorting the line, but you could be immersed into the culture and sponsored.		It's not just an idle question for me as I've been concerned how many indigenous ways of life are under threat by globalization &amp; disuse.
@NorfolkBeerDude @DeathMedieval savage, but true
@DeathMedieval A towel, a towel! My kingdom for a towel!
@george_capen A nation of @jack, not of laws - this seems to be the governing principle here.		Just kidding...the rationale seems to be that the Presidency should have a public record. I know, it seems bizarre, as REM asked Twitter to censor one of Trump's posts for copyright infringement.
@caramumfordfilm @plainsrover @NativeApprops @TwitchHollow I feel I simultaneously understand, and don't. Dan seemed to be saying he had Indigenous ancestry and wanted to reconnect; his family's indigenous identity was lost, and his nation's politics stopped him reconnecting.		As Chuck Hoskin Jr. said, you can let in anybody you wish :)

I mean hey, think of all the Moviepass-type deals you don't have to pay. A few thousand odd dollars is not a bad deal for 24/7 outrage humor matinees.
@plainsrover @NativeApprops @TwitchHollow Who's "we?" Obviously not the guy Dan here. This is just my sense of fair play, I don't make a habit of defending abusive commentators. (I hope.)
@swimming_blerd @Noahpinion Tangential thought: If one defines "semi-anarchic" loosely enough to encompass both the Western and the wasteland genre, what of expanding the genre from "lone warrior" to "isolated warriors?" A duo or even a small fighting band can be used to emphasize fractured traits. https://t.co/3R2B0Lx9BV
@swimming_blerd @Noahpinion The episodic structure of the animated series (in at least the earlier series) has a distinct three-part structure: Outrage committed, investigation and battle, and the final denoument - usually the restoration of order, or a tragic consideration of evil's aftermath.
@iridium_tea "My first clue that something was wrong was the empty bottle labeled "Po" on the shelf, Hastings. No one would think to look there."		Poirot himself boasted that should he plot a murder, he would leave no body. In practice he did not live up to this boast. https://t.co/oHfgPJZNyz
@iridium_tea Theory: Your kids can play in the street, you're probably not going to be targeted by an illegal Houston PD raid, and oncoming traffic usually stays in its lane.		Practice: We arbitrarily accept the third proposition but not the first two. (I distrust oncoming traffic, myself.)
@caramumfordfilm @NativeApprops @TwitchHollow There is a discussion somewhere around here - about mascots - that I would agree to characterize that way. Not the Dan / Dr. Keene dustup above. It's basically impossible to follow at this point because the initial post that set off Dan is gone now, and what's left is his rant.
@CJSummerfield @unveriphiedMike @JamilSmith Let me echo: SELECTIVE ENFORCEMENT of the laws doesn't work. Silently failing to enforce the laws is not a courageous act of civil dissent.
@JamilSmith Second Amendment purists have often argued that "we should just enforce the laws we have," but it seems to me that Second Amendment fundamentalism and distrust of the Federal government undermine that.		There hopefully is a simple remedy. For Aurora, a lawsuit.
@JamilSmith Furthermore, reports suggest the authorities apparently CHOSE to handicap the system by not passing that information on to the national database, ostensibly to protect firearms owners / buyers (it's not clear to me how the thinking would work).
@SethAbramson Hard to believe that it's already been 4 days into the Trump Emergency and the disaster of the Rose Garden Speech. That should have done it. We keep doing this. Where's the adults in charge?		We're basically at Lord of the Flies stage, @GOP looking for the ship to come to rescue.
@Noahpinion @swimming_blerd I know basically nothing about the giant robo genre, but isn't there a dose of wastelanditry in Universal Century? At least implied.
@swimming_blerd @Noahpinion Substantive represented by the postapocalyptic wasteland trek genre (FotNS &amp; Vampire Hunter D), and probably the Gundam / Macross style counts in your original def. as well https://t.co/6FjWW9oT6F
@kphextwin @JaminGrey @Noahpinion I've noticed this as well. People have to quote thousands of dollars for fairly small jobs.
@Noahpinion Good old article: "The Highwaymen" by D. Hapgood, from Washington Monthly's Inside the System, 1970. (Not to be confused with the Examiner.)
@DrTomMartinPhD well that escalated quickly
@MaxAbrahms @shane_bauer A tenet of American legal dogma is the ban on post ex facto law. It usually seems like a pretty good idea, too!
@caramumfordfilm @NativeApprops @TwitchHollow A suspicious recent example is this ADOS meme going around. Much of black Twitter doesn't know what to make of it, but it's just possible there really are some black people who think that their definition - black descendants of slaves - trumps others. I oppose that kind of thing.
@caramumfordfilm @NativeApprops @TwitchHollow Frauds on native identity are a big problem, make no mistake - I'm not trying to put this issue on indigenous people. But I fear identity control can give up too much to the new order forced on indigenous people by unequal treaties, racism, ethnic cleansing and genocide.
@caramumfordfilm @NativeApprops @TwitchHollow There's actually been a lot of recent coverage of people who "passed" for white, others who found out they had black ancestry.		The truth seems closer to this: Black people are happy to claim their own. Wilma Mankiller was happy to invite people. What's changed?
@Popehat There's a more interesting question here - the loose hivemind of Trumpites who all play from the same thuggish playbook and do what they can to provoke and incite. It probably doesn't rise to the level of chargeable offenses, but it's still corrosive on public order.

@SLOMetalDoc @RedIsDead Or less-tall center in basketball, or a small lineman in gridiron US football. There's nothing that says these folks can't or shouldn't play, but they are simply disadvantaged compared to players at the top of the game.		No more a choice to be trans than to be tall or muscular.
@SLOMetalDoc @RedIsDead That's been thought up, and seems an obviously bad idea because it excludes roughly half the population from many events.		I think a more helpful way to think about this is to think about the commentaries that Michael Phelps had "freakish" physical advantages for swimming.
@Popehat "We all lose a client to the Deep State at least once in our lives."
@_akhalik @NativeApprops Just in case this confuses someone: It was another person (Dan) who said that, and I'm not affiliated with him in any way other than replying to him in that thread.
@MuslimIQ The first REPORTED! anti-Muslim hate crime!		This lawless President, we'll all remember, is more interested in pushing the vile "dancing after 9/11" story. I think he's only stopped telling it because he forgot it.
@TheDreamGhoul Two kinds of bad people:		"Animals are monsters with no souls"	"Animals are actually just tiny people and you are hurting them somehow"
@_akhalik @NativeApprops Also, on this point, I noticed a number of things about Dan that I've seen before. Many people simply had their line to their past stolen, and are trying to get back.		I wasn't happy with his rant about hoaxes, which is being used right now in the Jussie Smollett case to divide.
@_akhalik @NativeApprops I won't speak for the Doctor. I try to build bridges to people, and I've spent a fair amount of time with Native communities that were...a whole mix of people. Some tribally enrolled and involved in their politics, others who were hangers-on who just wanted to be native.
@NativeApprops I only take exception to the "people try to claim Native." Their business. I was involved in a mascot protest years back, it was always a weird thing to try and balance staying on point with getting people to understand non-Native people don't control Native history or identity.
@AvOpJGA @abumaia @gina_scooter @Popehat The Deep Space?

@MuseWendi So wait, is the argument that PK is either wrong for having different culinary experiences, or that he is lying?		Thought the point he was making is that this is a silly thing to make into a campaign issue. Knowing who to vote for and why is a universal issue.
@Trillburne @GregJKrieg One of my follows called Paul Krugman an idiot for pointing out that this is a really bad policy plank to die for, lol		Identity politics can be good, and can also be really bad.
@NativeApprops @TwitchHollow Put another way, we'd all immediately understand if somebody said "I hate racism because it is harmful to blacks" and that was challenged with "are you black? How can you speak up for this?"		This doesn't end the argument, of course.
@NativeApprops @TwitchHollow Not here to stir up trouble, but "what nation are you" should be recognized as an attempt to exclude fellow indigenous people. I realize the need for identity politics but this is not a legitimate argumentative tactic - it's an argument against the person / appeal to authority.
@christopherburd @MaxAbrahms That's a good point. Evidentiary procedure would be lacking, national security trials appear to violate the Constitution, and US courts recently held (understandably) that the US should not render citizens to other nations. Ex case:	https://t.co/ezOVTQH3mJ	https://t.co/6fKnfw9YER
@simplicio823 @MattBruenig @yeselson @JillFilipovic Especially with the good press liberals try to give to maternal and paternal leave policies!
@JohnCarltonKing @notcapnamerica I'm happy for the standouts in the midterm wave, but it's  commonplace to hear people bash Hilary as if she was an insider Trump, and the refusal of Bros and Hillary fans (but especially Bros) to share credit is still poisoning the party. Dire look for 2020 unity.
@NateSilver538 A bit useless for me to chime in, but this is no opposition at all if it doesn't turn into a vote stripping the President of his abuse of illegally assumed powers.

@DrJenGunter @maureenjohnson Louis Pasteur wrote this unfunny joke :p
@MaxAbrahms Any returning citizen needs to have their day in a court of law to avoid the rush to judgment - but we shouldn't be foolish either. The public should punish this behavior just as severely as neo-Hitlerism.
@brianstelter @Area224 @Mediaite The end result is that bad actors seeking to push back civil rights are charging into the void left by this hasty retreat, and media commentators look opportunistic and unprincipled too.
@brianstelter @Area224 @Mediaite It seems like many organizations haven't learned the lesson of decoupling reporting from opinion. However, the retreat ended up looking worse for anti-racism than the facts justify, and there's not enough defense of the views that were supposedly strongly held convictions.
@brianstelter @Area224 Since this is in my feed let me reiterate a point: Many journalists (according to the @Mediaite account) used the controversy to air broad, fairly uncontroversial takes on marginalization in America. Hitching that wagon to a developing story left these folks ditching their views.
@Julio_Rosas11 This certainly gives the appearance of wanting to throw everybody else under the bus - including Smollett, whose likely hoax is reprehensible if true, but also represents activism.		The result is that many commentators hitched up anti-racism to a hoax; now they're erasing both.
@subalternuplift Just a tangential thought - the early post about the pretense of marginalized power reminded me immediately of the Trump faction's holding up of hoaxes as today's major issue. We all have to find the best starting point and work out from it, rather than seeking it premade.
@coleyworld The ashes of facts.

@EdKrassen 'The inspectors also found the restaurant’s conditions to be “conducive to attracting vermin” and “allowing vermin to exist.”'		Somebody alert Bob Mueller!
@4everNeverTrump "4everNeverTrump" is what we need to focus on - bringing all our anger to that cause, not to reopening old wounds for people who only share traits in common with Trump by accident. We're all humans and even the best may fall in a pumpkin pie now and then.
@kunktation @nlr "Postmodern charisma?" YGBSM!		That article could use an executive summary (frustratingly, the one in the link above is lost somewhere).		IMO, what's been most effective is constant policing of instrumental lies and failures to serve even the Trump base.

@Sali1368 @Bravewriting We really shouldn't be subjecting our overweight friends to this, though.		Just highlighting his contempt for America as @nbcsnl does every Saturday, and how he is a goon going to jail, as @PalmerReport does, is enough to make him mad.
@wagatwe @CNN Ahh, this is that fabled liberal media we've heard so much about.		I remember when people agreed to call "underage sex" statutory rape, to place the blame for endangering a child squarely on the shoulders of responsible adults!
@PaleoPhil @MaxAbrahms Restraining bad Syrian counterterrorism tactics is still a threat to "US government interests," whether it is a policy objective the Trump Administration realizes or not. Your post doesn't make that distinction, hence the confusion.
@ProudResister Where nothing can be measured against anything but a gut feeling, at that.		According to swamp creatures, the existence of race hoaxes and attacks on their orange fellow are more important than bottling the flow of hate crimes, extremist murders, and white nationalism.
@wartzilla @MaxAbrahms Yes, agreed entirely. Our stated goal of preventing attacks on civilians isn't served by this, and a reckoning on responsibility for such attacks will have to wait for peace - as was the case in conflicts like Northern Ireland. Just tossing out Assad would be Libya once again.
@FaithFortune99 @paulkrugman Meanwhile, I've seen a number of leftist black women (or, of course, just accounts claiming to be) calling out other black leftists for useless misogyny and other nothing burger failslams on Harris.		Hot sauce on greens is not a campaign issue.
@FaithFortune99 @paulkrugman This is an epic of missing the point. Criticizing Harris over a photo op is the least important activity of leftist Twitter, who have more pressing concerns over whether she's a cop or covered up Catholic crimes.
@DanKaszeta Writing analysis is kind of like clearing a clogged pipe when you think about it. Ergo, learning a trade and splitting your time will give you greater perspective, because random queue guy's insights were so useful.
@wartzilla @MaxAbrahms Even were we not threatening to abandon them, opposing the development of peaceful relationships is not our bailiwick. The turn to the Syrian government should only concern us so far as it threatens the use of bad methods.
@PaleoPhil @MaxAbrahms I think this subtly misreads the problem with this policy. Our objective should be to promote effective but humane antiterrorism tactics. Instead, our leadership would apparently rather try to push a string and have no leverage in one of the critical antiterrorism theaters.

@BlueTigerPub @waltshaub If it was a matter of pure logic I'd have to agree, but in any society diverse people have diverse reactions to comments. Attempting to understand our impact and limiting collateral damage is a critical part of being a modern progressive.
@KyleKulinski The brand-burnishing among the unenlightened (like myself) is a happy accident.		Speaking of coincidences, most political fundraising works in the same way - it's distributed to TV networks, after a sizable "fee" is taken by friendly political operatives "brokering" the ad buy.

@Cyberfrog81 @randomuserbr @BlueBoxDave I'm a simple man. I see somebody doing something bad, or I'm doing something bad, and I seek to fix that.		Structurally, we can recognize that the biggest problem right now is no longer Islamic-associated terrorism. It's white supremacy.		Folks ought to settle down a bit.
@4everNeverTrump @realDonaldTrump We do need to have a chat about China's protectionism and abuse of special status. In the end, though Trump is wrong on the details, we do need to prevent capital flows to countries that use those tactics.

@LKmings @4everNeverTrump @williamlegate @realDonaldTrump I think we're close to being on the same page. Tariffs are taxes, paid for by consumers in that country. President Trump's tariffs are a tax on US consumers. Although he gets details wrong, I would agree his objective is to punish the foreign makers of imports, as a response.

That said, I don't mean to discount that sometimes they do draw the connections you don't hear elsewhere - and that's useful.
@LeftwardSwing I can definitely confirm some of my follows were attacking his age.		Personally I'm more interested in other candidates now, but I won't forget what he has done for the Dems and neither should new candidates.
@BGMorgan4 @randomuserbr @BlueBoxDave What strawman? I'm just working off your rhetoric. You said that 6100 hate crimes aren't an epidemic, and seem to discount wholly that there are obvious everyday acts of racism that we ought to be policing. The only time I saw you mention policing racism was when it was leftist.
@joshtpm @TPM I kinda want to rip off his face mask and see what's really underneath. Not a brain, that you can count on.
@BGMorgan4 @randomuserbr @BlueBoxDave If I take the reasoning you've presented so far, the incidence of mob violence and auto bandits in the Prohibition / Depression eras wasn't a big deal, because there probably weren't all that many John Dillingers around, when you get down to it. That attitude will help the G-Men!
@BGMorgan4 @randomuserbr @BlueBoxDave Why do you dismiss the substantial year-on-year upticks in one category of crime, hate crime, which is overwhelmingly associated with white supremacy in its latest year? "It's not an epidemic" is pure sophistry and doesn't mean a damn thing.
@BGMorgan4 @randomuserbr @BlueBoxDave If a few dozen hoaxes - many appropriately leading to charges, as noted - anger you, then why wouldn't the many miserable racist acts below crime from "the fine people" also warrant a condemnation?
@defcon_5 @nycsouthpaw @brianstelter This is kinda what happens when you can buy news orgs cheap and divest all the actual journalists.		@MSNBC often has very good analysis, but these networks have too many people on who aren't journos. It'd be like me going out there to talk aboot what I read on the Twits.
@BGMorgan4 @randomuserbr @BlueBoxDave I know about Bill Sparkman. Question is, what do you think the existence of hoaxes intimates for anti-racism policy in the US, and why aren't you saying anything about the well-researched spike in hate crimes since 2016?
@Hshtgpoundsign1 @GOP Nah, I didn't call you on it. I should find the link to some historical research on this subject I found a while ago. They know who started the plan and everything. Probably related to the Stone / Atwater / Ailes gang.		I like to share what I know, that's all =)
@carvellwallace A home for one homeless person or a sandwich for one hungry child is better than one billionaire. Money is just a high score unless it's used!
@BGMorgan4 @randomuserbr @BlueBoxDave The plural of anecdote is data, right?		I love like sticking to the facts &amp; hate false flag attacks, but I'm going to continue to be more concerned about the epidemic of violence from white supremacists.
@nicolazzo_e @MotherJones Y'know, I wonder how much this Administration depletes the ozone layer just to look good on camera.
@Hshtgpoundsign1 @GOP The plan was actually cooked up a bit earlier, in the '70s.		There also have been scattered goons like this lovely fellow:	https://t.co/GPzXTCZTb8

@smallwars I can't help but wince every time the armed forces' periodicals have to cover the messes President Trump creates from them. Thankfully, "just the facts, ma'am" is enough to get the point across.
@guardian Dog as ringbearer works, I've seen it done. Small poodle/scottie + ring in box on a loop around the dog's neck. Guess you could do it with a Saint Bernard, too, just swap out the barrel.
@Noahpinion From my own reading list: I wonder if the "Goals for Americans" report issued at the end of the Eisenhower Admin ('59/'60) touches on this subject, it seems it would.		Also Heinlein's "Tunnel in the Sky" ('55) starts off fun but has this really dark passage about "coolies" :/
@Noahpinion The bit about "be more like the Asians" is interesting background behind the LBJ Administration's policy of selling the story "blacks have never had it so good." The political impulse often overrides the goals of justice &amp; truth.

But Jerkface is easier to explain.
@EdKrassen Spoiler alert - the reason she quit does not militate for the conclusion "she is a good person." She broke the law!
@randomuserbr @BlueBoxDave I'll just sit here and be astonished for 5 straight minutes that you used the word "priors" while attempting to burn down the entire antiracism movement to a single hoax, as if we have all been floating in a vacuum-sealed pack waiting for this moment. (:
@randomuserbr @BlueBoxDave You learned nothing from Covington if the lesson you took away from it was "what I want to see is the truth."		We have reliable metrics for hate crimes. We don't have a chance at a good metric for racism in total because much of it is subjective; but we know how to fight it.
@RogueEvildoer @realDonaldTrump Whenever I see JFC in connection with President Trump, I wonder if it's a new fast food chain he's a big fan of.

@cricketcrocker This is why girls are smarter. You're sitting there trying to 4D chess a theoretical opponent's moves before he makes them! :)		Me, a silly boy: "Huh huh, I got that joke"
@jenelaina Yes, that's true. "Polish jokes" are finally starting to die out in the US. In Britain, however, there's been hate crimes against the sizable first-generation Polish immigrants. There have been something like 1 million immigrants from Poland, and people fixate on that number.
@BlairImani Falsehoods need to be policed for the same reason that I asked @GovernorVA to consider resigning after his blackface controversy - you can't represent progress after acts that are simply bad.
@BlairImani Assuming - we still don't really know - that Smollett actually did create a hoax, we can support him on a personal level (get some help!) and give the important context (why did he think it was right?) but we cannot abide a falsehood, either.
@BlairImani IMO, the "believe survivors" language itself is a flashpoint that is clearly confusing many. One can be an ally of people who are standing up - even be an ally to people who may well-naturedly create hoaxes. But we can't forget where the road to hell starts.
@Ashhtastic1 @DougieJr93 @BlairImani I wish Smollett gets help - but this could also be a false police report, which justifiably has consequences!
@patricklittle19 @thinkdefence @NigelJB @Taurevanime I'd love to see that! Russia seems to optimize for smash-and-grab, and the response to that - and similar moves by other militaries - probably isn't best countered by mirroring their inventory.
@cricketcrocker ...sounds like my time in undergrad watching how funds get disbursed to researchers &amp; systems.
@cricketcrocker When Enbridge's Line 6b - which I didn't even know was there! - broke spilling oil and fumes, I learned that these things are not engineered to never break. They're engineered to be forgotten for 40 years and only fixed when the risk and costs of spillage reach arbitrary markers.
@CInsistence The good thing about #vaccination is that you get the benefits of immune system exposure to childhood diseases, in much safer situations with fewer of the risks for complications, such as childhood mortality.
@spartymarc More bitter fruit of the decades-long right-wing effort to promote 'truthiness,' conspiracy theories, and identity politics. Ergo, Smollett is more interesting to talk about because he played to that. Mackey's boys aren't so interesting unless it's tied to Obama's FEMA camps.
@IsLennuBanned @Twitter @TwitterSupport @twittersecurity @lennutrajektoor @sooohuuuumm Right. I'm sorry for appearing to support a hands-off approach here. Twitter needs to police its own communities and not punish its users who attempt to do so.
@patricklittle19 @thinkdefence @NigelJB @Taurevanime I'm asking in part because we keep hearing that the days of WWII-style battles are over, but widespread adoption of dozers (or fixed attachments for more traditional tanks) could prove a drain on logistics if it goes unused in a future war by a resource-starved army.
@IsLennuBanned @Twitter @TwitterSupport @twittersecurity @lennutrajektoor @sooohuuuumm It sounds to me like you should prevail. But I don't see any social media committing the kind of resources to combat this even if the courts demand it, any more than paper owners divesting themselves of the journalists who should be doing work like you.		However, any rules help!
@J_sandy1009 @brianstelter @ArthurSchwartz @DonaldJTrumpJr @CNN Agreed, but news orgs always have to maintain their credibility and explain their process when it's questioned. News that's not believed becomes grist for the QAnon mill.
@patricklittle19 @thinkdefence @NigelJB @Taurevanime Do "lessons" from combat against what I understood to be lightly armed groups in Israel's Gaza operations or the British Army in N. Ireland warrant the adoption of such a vehicle? Is it too specialized, or actually very flexible for urban combat?
@Taurevanime @thinkdefence Interesting reading - it seems like military and industry often take a "toolbox" approach when a "tool belt" one may be more appropriate, slimming down inventories and platforms. When they do look at comprehensive systems, it seems to end up in cost overruns and complexity.
@IsLennuBanned @Twitter @TwitterSupport @twittersecurity @lennutrajektoor @sooohuuuumm This is probably only ever going to be solved by throwing the resources of government in to police "the cyber," for all the reasons you've cited. This arena isn't just the plaything of teens and investors anymore.
@Gesithan @JediofGallifrey "Why not all five?"		brb, breaking out the chalk and tracing a pentagram to summon Centrism!
@TheEconomist Facebook and Twitter may well fall with one bust cycle, like the Dotcom Bust from 2000. They may just decide they don't like you and your network, like Tumblr kicked out all adult content and groups.
@TheEconomist If what I'm suggesting - public funding for social networks and digital libraries - sounds radical, wait until you hear about the Library of Congress, the public origins of the Internet, and the TVA!		All those good things have survived many booms and busts.
@TheEconomist There's a catch-22 here: We give networks power over us for the simple right to catch up with friends (and foes), or consume media, but hands-off capitalism means any digital network can delete this part of our shared history at any time.		Yet we refuse public funding.
@IDreamOnDemand @lyn_cade “Those who foolishly sought power by riding the back of the tiger ended up inside," as President Kennedy said.		Putin's reckless adventures waste funds his own country desperately needs, and he's losing popularity. We just need to hang in there and continue to stand together.
@IDreamOnDemand @lyn_cade Russian Imperialism is alive and well; the corrupt elites there would love to see America just strong enough and open enough to launder their funds here. However, in the end it's a failing strategy because nobody can control the kind of hate and disinformation they're unleashing.

@vodkaskank 2 comments: Throwing @IlhanMN was consensual; Rep. Omar seems to agree she had to move on quickly and derail the antisemitism charges. GND can be improved (though some version of it needed to be passed back in the 90s).		Congress is naturally seniority obsessed, conservative.

@lyn_cade The "who will X help" question can have its merits, but history makes it clear to me that Russia's major goal is sowing division and chaos, and creating cracks to inject their other meta-narratives.		If they push for one candidate, it's a temporary tactic, not a strategy.

@RuthCaldwell210 @pyochum81 @SirHatchporch @GavinNewsom @KamalaHarris That's fine, but I think Number 6 has got it right too - we need to get the candidates make their own cases.

@SailorPsy @DougJones Whether it makes sense that his original role in the crack crackdown was spurred just by local leaders asking for help, I don't know. But on the whole his signalling openness was like a plank of wood for a shipwrecked sailor in the wreckage of this lawless administration.
@SailorPsy @DougJones From his public hearing it seems like Barr's views are slowly evolving from his 90s work - but not Fox-demented. On the topic of the disastrous crack cocaine hysteria, he seemed to admit the policy inadequate and showed interest in going to local communities for input.

@jessesingal (I'm nobody; my decision on tweeting was to wait for more details for Smollett - and also Covington.)	deBoer's article here emphasizes political consequences, so sometimes you must cut the line. The ultimate test, however, is whether the choice serves reporting the naked truth.
@jessesingal I try to watch for false dichotomies in framing. Freddie deBoer's obviously right about self-censorship and the shape of the issue, but there are also times when one simply has to make a judgment call if it's worthy to short-circuit a 'process' that doesn't go anywhere.

@cptbmw @twellmaker @robowieland @AOC About being "the decider" of net positives - look, it's fairly simple. If you are a trillion dollar company, you can pay taxes. The negotiations with Amazon didn't get far enough for anybody to raise the specter of bureaucratic micromanagement; they threw the towel immediately.
@cptbmw @twellmaker @robowieland @AOC If you're the unemployed person, you're not getting a job in HQ2, which they were hoping to staff with high-powered CS grads and the like. You might qualify for one of the low-skilled fulfillment center jobs, though, which they still are staffing.		Amazon is coy with numbers.

@JohnCarltonKing @mattyglesias It's more than that; it's lobbying and how "the tragedy of the commons" works as well.		That guy's comment is 100% ignorant of externalities and network effects.
@justicedanielh This is not the message I take away from your syllabus, which admits from the outset that Warren was trying to prove her "Native American ancestry," but then goes on to "question her supposed Cherokee and Delaware heritage [...]" - a broader claim than here.
@UweBollocks go get em!
@justicedanielh I don't know your business but Warren doesn't strike me as a fraud. When Wilma Mankiller was giving a speech and a man in the back of the audience said "I'm Cherokee," she said "come on home." She said that another man had said the same thing and was directing the tribal museum.
@__MissMeg__ @dimar1971 @kaygoo5 @JoeKhalilTV Hmm, yeah, I don't see it.

@nyc118 @AnandWrites I'm sure I'm missing the point of having a one-word summary wildly, but I would characterize Bill &amp; Melinda as 'redistribution.' Focused reinvestment in people whose lives can be improved the most by cheap interventions. Many other wealthy folks probably believe the same.
@nyc118 @AnandWrites Gates isn't right about everything (his grasp of economics is probably a bit better than mine?) but I don't think that's really an accurate summary of his position. Besides, he's still clued-in enough to know that actual scientific advance has been slowing down lately.
@fsjenner @thistallawkgirl I still don't know what's going on!		...story of my life.
@JPerschino @johnoneillnyc @george_capen @jiveDurkey "It takes Trump to have omelet pans like these"
@justicedanielh In short I would not like to pick a fight, but the linked syllabus is very nation citizen-centric, and any claims that one authority speaks for all people - distinct from pointing out a majority view or the considered view of the nation's leadership - is simply bad faith argument
@justicedanielh That's a sweeping claim. Hoskin distorted Warren's claim, however wrong she was to make it, illuminated nothing for the public. But my own experience with people of other nations is that the awareness you claim on behalf of others isn't universal.
@PokemonGO599 @TaylorLorenz @allabouttroy @McGuire72 Metal, Gear, Liquid, whatever needs doing. I'm just a handyman around the house, though, I'm not a pro plumber or anything :)
@kaygoo5 @JoeKhalilTV An easy thing to demand, but this is the time we live in. If we had some leadership on attempting to tamp down the public fears, maybe things could start to heal.
@justicedanielh Yet, neither were the public statements of Chuck Hoskin Jr. especially helpful, as he repeated a statement that mischaracterized Warren's statement.		And then there's the issue of some Indigenous people attempting to speak for all other Indigenous people:	https://t.co/yrhY08R3lI
@justicedanielh Erasure goes both ways, friend. Genocide left some people with the tribe, and some without it.		Please understand that I'm not saying that Warren's conception of what the DNA test would do was right, or that her way of talking about this was especially helpful.

@andrewkimmel Right-wingnuts spent the entirety of the Obama years worrying about car carriers and cattle cars and FEMA camps, but when the shoe's on the other foot we see how far their respect for law and order goes.
@cptbmw @twellmaker @robowieland @AOC Good question. So far we haven't seen any evidence that Amazon really was interested in being a net positive for Queens, let alone interested in working to ensure people already living there got some of those jobs, could remain in their homes, or would not suffer congestion.
@JonJonefc @paul__johnson @stevenmorris20 @carlanine The real long-term effects, not just in the US or the UK, is that Russia is scaring people about what it might do - and its targets often fall into rounds of self-recrimination and division.

@SirHatchporch @GavinNewsom @KamalaHarris One thing more I ought to say - Newsom's endorsement was anodyne and he may have felt it appropriate to counter the growing negatives out there. That, or he just really wants a fellow Californian in the WH. Whatever his reasons, I don't see this endorsement moving the needle much
@SirHatchporch @pyochum81 @GavinNewsom @KamalaHarris I do agree with the sentiment of letting the candidates have their say. Unfortunately the debates are set for June and everybody knows there's plenty of time for the party to self-immolate before then. This is gonna be a long Cold War until then.

@rennyzucker @mattyglesias My comment about the Supreme Court seat was more that we needed to pin down McConnell to having one rule for appointments - if he's going to claim that the people should have a vote before an appointment, then let him always say that. This is about protecting norms &amp; rules.
@TheAtlantic @TaylorLorenz More to the point, though, I've been seeing a LOT of anger and trouble caused by "snitching," where somebody tags a bad actor or topic and the horde comes in. It's the proven way to get more eyeballs on your topic, but as long as we have Russian bots all over the damn place...
@TheAtlantic @TaylorLorenz Gordon Brown was tweeting what he had for breakfast when the basic structure of Twitter was settled. Maybe a more forum board-style interface could go places.		I do kind of like the tension caused when MAGA trolls unexpectedly crash your party, or when you do the same to them.
@rennyzucker @mattyglesias That said, I basically agree with you. We should be focused on reinforcing norms and limiting these structural weaknesses.
@rennyzucker @mattyglesias One would think so, but Mitch McConnell's theft of a Supreme Court seat, and the Dem failure to press the case for the McConnell standard to hold through the midterms, means that the ship may have already sailed. At this point it's using all tools to triage.

@NateSilver538 A lot of people around Trump have been spouting off about civil war...and hasn't he done so as well?
@Nagler @brianstelter "I'll leave you in suspense"

@nyt_diff lol, Afghan Maverick.		RIP Sen. McCain.
@SaceMayne007 @Thomasurlatoile It's almost like they exclusively read each other and their policies are the same. In fact, if we didn't have the convenient labels, we would have to say they were otherwise identical with each other.
@JoyAnnReid @paulkrugman, take note: This is why Trump can never be satisfied. $1Bn on His Wall? But oh, oh, OBAMA had a Nobel Peace Prize! Infamy! Scurrilous pandering! What a shame!
@brianbeutler Edifying the public.
@JonGarbarino @brianschatz @thumppooh Trump seems more like a classic Section 8.
@PeterAlexander May you go down in history as the man who brought the grift machine to its final, clattering halt!

@jaymcb74 @MichaelArcane @arc315 @mfinn3333 @bobrosepres @Katharine_Mckee @Stevietheman66 @EvanPoulas @akarl_smith @AOC I don't know what you're mad at me about. I'm not in favor of these piecemeal "solutions" that, as you point out, often do lots of harms.		Perhaps you'd also care to take issue with one Donald J. Trump, who advocated "soaking the rich" in 1999.		https://t.co/RJClUmpVkP
@MaxAbrahms I've run into pro-opposition refugees who also are just as angry about US intervention, though, so U.S. and Western observers ought to ask themselves how they have failed so spectacularly. Probably these groups all have shared criticism; it's not all disingenuous.
@MaxAbrahms The pushback from Assad/Russia apologists for criticizing their approach being, well, BAD is something else. There's no interest in building a better state amongst supporters of the Syrian government. Or the Wikileaks fanatics.
@MaxAbrahms The confounding variable, for me, is the issue of Syria's historical approach to "law and order," the classic being the massacre at the end of the Islamist rebellion of the mid 70s. I get why they did it, and that we need to be diplomatically productive.
@alxred21 @KyleWBibby @commondefense I get why people might choose to survive at all costs. As a civilian I don't take the right to criticize choices people made under stress. But as a human being I think I have the right to criticize people trying to whittle away moral leadership in warfare.
@alxred21 @KyleWBibby @commondefense I heard a hell of a lot during the 2016 campaign about how good Trump was going to be, how bad Clinton was going to be - well, here we are. Donald Trump has employed John Bolton and all the other clumsy grifters who blow up diplomatic tension into outright wars. It's sick.
@alxred21 @KyleWBibby @commondefense Your story is making me misty eyed. I remember a story my H.S. guidance counselor told us about Vietnam. He said everybody knew you could be blown up by kids with grenades...but he and his fellow soldiers wanted to continue being human. So they accepted the risk and kept giving.
@1a @lynnsweet Firing Andrew McCabe (who has a new book out, which hopefully will net him some good money) was not just about sticking it to McCabe. It was about sending a message, the same way the constant dangling of Presidential pardons was meant to send a message.		It's obstructing justice.
@jaymcb74 @MichaelArcane @arc315 @mfinn3333 @bobrosepres @Katharine_Mckee @Stevietheman66 @EvanPoulas @akarl_smith @AOC Hey Jay, if you're going to try and debate policy with me, I'm game. I'm always ready &amp; interested to hear what kind of ideas libertarians etc. have. But it is fair to point out that you are not advancing a debate with your giant PragerU image macro and sloganeering.
@brianstelter He's not heavy, he's my President		(Literally carrying supine man on your back.)
@stydiut @heatherschwitz5 @JHenry0716 @Redrooffsman @MichaelTCoffee @KimKardashian I can't really disagree with you, either. Hah...		Personally I like what they did, even if it is definitely in the "silly fun" category for me.
@cricketcrocker The Huron definitely was used for power generation at mills and the like:	https://t.co/26uog9dUny
@cricketcrocker If there are historic homes on the east side - Doctors and the like - that may be telling as a sign about where the "right" and "wrong" sides of the tracks were historically. I'd expect industries right along the river to the North as well, too. Dunno if they had shipping.
@elisabeth More sorry that this sick man is still free. Can't help but be reminded of Cosby - and Jeffrey Epstein. Americans, black and otherwise, don't need enablers. R. Kelly shoulda been stopped a very, very long time ago.
@elisabeth I'm so sorry :(
@Giffff_OW @1a @NPRrelving Given what we know about Russian interference in democracies, and what we know about his ties to Russia's ex-KGB ringleader, many people are asking if the constant shutdown threats and the obsession over the wall are really just a plot against US governance.		That's where we are.
@Giffff_OW @1a @NPRrelving It's only a "defeat" for the President because he's so unclear about what he wants - or doesn't know it himself.		I've been saying for a long time that he could easily take credit for the #wallbrainworm that has been dominating headlines and Congress. He just isn't happy to.
@jaymcb74 @MichaelArcane @arc315 @mfinn3333 @bobrosepres @Katharine_Mckee @Stevietheman66 @EvanPoulas @akarl_smith @AOC Oh boy, the yacht business? You really wanna go there? If you want to support traditional crafts, you ought to recognize that it's a boom-and-bust business reliant on wealthy largesse.		People were talking about this 10 years ago. Nothing has changed.
@MichaelArcane @arc315 @mfinn3333 @bobrosepres @Katharine_Mckee @Stevietheman66 @EvanPoulas @akarl_smith @AOC Let's pause right there. Where was all this concern about "economically crippling" the rust belt when Scott Walker tried out a 40-year-plan, or when Warren Buffett's Intermodal started crushing little Elwood, Illinois, because IT DIDN'T COLLECT TAXES?		https://t.co/ssanwM8Maf

@levi_gay @Stevietheman66 @mfinn3333 @EvanPoulas @Katharine_Mckee @arc315 @akarl_smith @AOC Here's a neat article on that:		https://t.co/uFgrwis85c
@levi_gay @Stevietheman66 @mfinn3333 @EvanPoulas @Katharine_Mckee @arc315 @akarl_smith @AOC It's kind of funny but this is the only counterpoint I've seen that has any truth to it.		But let's dive in on that. Bing Crosby set up corporations to pay him a salary; movie stars deferred profits. To dodge the marginal tax they ended up living more austere lives!
@Jesse_Merl @nycsouthpaw "...He would have given us a ticket." - Mel Brooks
@Jesse_Merl @nycsouthpaw Meanwhile I'll just sit here and remember the Good Old Days when we went to the Moon, created the Interstate Highway System, produced hybrid crops that fed the world, stopped child labor, and more - through vision, policy, and taxes.		"If God wanted us to fly..."
@Jesse_Merl @nycsouthpaw There's already HR1 going through. I'd rather go by train than plane for regional travel. All these things are doable if we have the guts. I get why you're not sold on &amp; #GND certainly isn't ready for prime time, but don't lie to yourself that these are impossible goals.
@ksej @transscribe I left a comment with EJ Levy, but I've realized too late that this is exploitation for money - I'm trying to figure out if the author realizes that. What was that doggie whistle meant to accomplish? Inquired for details, but not a good start, middle, or finish. Automatic F-.
@EJLevy As a person in a facile gender category (male, born as &amp; remaining so), let me ask you this: Are you using phrases to try and pass as an ally, are you exploiting to court controversy for sales, or something else?		You have just built yourself a big hill to climb over.
@MichaelArcane @arc315 @mfinn3333 @bobrosepres @Katharine_Mckee @Stevietheman66 @EvanPoulas @akarl_smith @AOC I wish I hadn't buried my last comment, but here it is: If the only opposition to this kind of "dealing" is scattered, then of course other municipalities may take advantage. Paying taxes needs to be the law of the land.		https://t.co/eQLgmFt0hB
@MichaelArcane @arc315 @mfinn3333 @bobrosepres @Katharine_Mckee @Stevietheman66 @EvanPoulas @akarl_smith @AOC As long as the country is stuck in this toxic, Trumpian-style "transactional democracy" where we're meant to believe that tax incentives are the only way to attract private investment, you'd be right.		Thankfully that is not the major reason why private investment happens.
@MichaelArcane @arc315 @mfinn3333 @bobrosepres @Katharine_Mckee @Stevietheman66 @EvanPoulas @akarl_smith @AOC I didn't pass up anything, because I'm not one of the Glorious Leaders that raised or sunk this 'deal.'		As I pointed out earlier, Amazon's official statement makes clear they reserve the right to boost employment wherever they like.
@ChappellTracker Pangolins are pretty polite for being biofuel-powered tanks.
@GamingAngelus @ChappellTracker For some reason I was thinking of Evolve. I gotta step up mah game?
@PDChina We're going to need a bigger camera
@follow2099 @mattyglesias Makes one wonder how much of the 'decision paralysis' is well-intentioned, and how much was planted to poison the entire decision.		Interesting to note that the Koch Bros. are well-known to be pro-cars and pro-petroleum industries, and anti-rail lobbying is part of their effort.
@hayesstamper @IntelexualMedia That's a very cool heirloom. I'd love to sign up for that class just to learn from Dr. Carver. Is there anything he wasn't involved in teaching?		He reminds me a lot of one of my favorite professors from my early secondary ed., Ron Smith from @Kellogg_CC, who also is incredible!
@IntelexualMedia This is cool. Can you tell me who digitized this incredible footage?		We need more eyeballs on Dr. Carver to remind them what's at stake when we promote White Supremacy and ethnic cleansing - stagnation in science and the promotion of pure laziness. https://t.co/12l8w3HQmb
@veterans_i @muzykb The only people who really like Trump are the ones so far behind him that they can't smell him. Everybody else is just holding their noses while collecting their checks.
@muzykb @veterans_i Form letter: I am a (marginalized person) and after this (MAGA-hyped event) I proudly say I support Dolor Turnip for President. We need to get behind this big, beautiful, powerful man!
@Artists_Ali @cricketcrocker We love you too &lt;3		It's too easy to get snarky in the Trump Era and hurt people. Our friends over in #VetsResistSquadron had a thread going last week about being careful where we aim our tweets.
@EXAIR Ha, thanks EXAIR. We're both born the same year too, can you believe that? Time flies when you're having fun blasting compressed air around :)
@nycsouthpaw ...and cities will be freed from chasing after phantom "incentive packages" and fighting with other cities. Cities will be rivals, but they can be allies too. Everybody wins when private enterprise helps fund the infrastructure they rely on.
@nycsouthpaw Thanks for being so clear &amp; readable on this subject where I have been stumbling around!		Ultimately, the move against HQ2 Queens is NOT anti-NYC. If we can push the discussion back to where paying taxes is the new normal (again), companies will still select based on merit.
@ericswalwell One more: How the #WallBrainWorm has shifted our debate to this policy nothing-berder, soaking up attention more than money - attention that is best spent elsewhere.		Spend on border security or don't, but we have harder things to talk over right now!
@washingtonpost President Trump unilaterally shifted the narrative but never thought to take credit for it. Truly astonished by how this one little phrase has turned into a brain worm eating away at not only Trump's tiny brain, but the entire government which should be spending money elsewhere.
@washingtonpost Many political outsiders (like myself) realized the pernicious reality here: Trump had, at one stroke, managed to turn a campaign slogan into a real policy plank. Despite not funding his "wall," Democrats have widely signed on to increasing funding for the border.
@LisaBloom @IlhanMN I agree without reservations. Trolling @IlhanMN is bad enough; this is a step beyond that.		It's also aggravating that this is the story to run with, when reporters were being shoved by capitol police for asking questions of Senators!
@transscribe As a random white guy (born and living as male) I don't fathom how somebody would invoke "facile gender categories" when Dr. Barry made HIS! wishes absolutely explicit. You don't write about somebody solely for the sake of discussing these issues, only to disrespect &amp; erase them.
@cricketcrocker It's also really interesting how this is a citywide tax issue (I assume?) but the line studiously avoids Ward 2, almost as if it was planned that way...is that a historical artifact from the point chosen to cross the Huron River?
@cricketcrocker @db_blog What I did read suggests that German rail operation is less reliant on audible warnings.		I've read some railfans state they slept best with heavy freight passing directly outside their window - cute, but on the whole, noise &amp; vibration harms people &amp; wildlife.
@cricketcrocker This is a really good analysis. Train horns are manually operated so they may sound much longer than required.		Here's a study from Latin America:	https://t.co/12GTTFTwMi		A cursory search didn't give me any reliable info on European horn noise and usage. Help @db_blog?
@TPM Mike Rogers never got my vote for talk like "you can't have your privacy violated if you don't know your privacy is violated," but he served on the House Intel Committee. When he says your emergency is a phony, you'd better listen!
@dog_winky @VinceSchilling But even better than best-dog-breed snobbery is Winky's winning attitude. Don't stress, smile for the crowd, and have fun with your life no matter what the judges say!
@Nancyfourdogs @veterans_i No worries - every time the @GOP sends their worst to Capitol Hill, the charges keep piling up and the witches keep getting melted.		"Trump's Base" might love crass theater and disrespecting Rep. Nadler on TV, but they're going to be very disappointed in the sequel.
@dog_winky @VinceSchilling Follower #33 reporting in for duty ;)	Bichon Frises are the best. Undeniable fact!
@AnnaBordelon84 @EvanPoulas @Stevietheman66 @Katharine_Mckee @arc315 @akarl_smith @AOC Oh really? How's your tax refund going? Bigger than last year?		This is a bigger issue than just a NYC one. I can understand why NYC residents are mad about the deal falling through, but in the long run it is shifting money back into taxes for people everywhere - if we stay on.
@LexGoyle @onecaliberal @RepTedLieu @POTUS If your concern is about the metrics, then push @realDonaldTrump to support improving U.S. domestic intelligence gathering capabilities.		The next thought writes itself: Why is the Trump Administration so keen on hamstringing the discussion by HIDING OR DISTORTING facts?
@RepTedLieu @POTUS Now here's a series worth watching!
@drvox It sounds boring, but the legacies of the New Deal are cool things you can point to, like art deco infrastructure, forests planted by out-of-work laborers, support for the arts, as well as purely bureaucratic institutions like Social Security.		Building upgrades will employ many.
@drvox Literally everybody forgets - even in the list of things to forget - carbon sequestration technologies, i.e., trees. Putting that aside, though, I like your approach here - GND type projects fall short of the New Deal name if they do not embrace the power of useful bureaucracy.
@TPM I was amused to see that STEVE PEOPLES (in all caps) contributed to this report.		Sure, we can talk about whether the pols really will succeed in staying in office or fulfill their campaign promises. But headlines like these always seem like a short way of saying "it's too much!"
@AuschwitzMuseum The Museum has my support for being an impartial witness to this modern charade of people who come to lay wreaths but will not lay their reputations against genocide and ethnic cleansing. The pictures speak for themselves, and the people need to replace these opportunists.
@evrsoelusv @AuschwitzMuseum Pence and even the Jewish members of Trump's cabinet have always put the illusion of solidarity ahead of the fight against their out-of-control President's aid and comfort to evildoers. Since they feel won't do it, it's up to the rest of us to blow up the illusion.
@VryKranky @Chinchillazllla And, furthermore, groups with religious or other grounds to oppose end-of-life care for infants, such as Catholic groups, are sacrificing the right to informed debate if they sign on to these political diktats from the far right. It is about how we choose to make hard decisions.
@VryKranky @Chinchillazllla It's a given among philosophers of medical ethics that this is an open question. Anybody who claims to be interested in the ethical argument should be strongly opposed to the flippant way in which the Republican Party, specifically, have attempted to dictate an answer.
@RedTRaccoon There's been a lot of talk lately about US support for Israel and Saudi Arabia, but we ought to pay more attention to "US allies" with an unambiguous record of support for terrorist groups used to harm their neighbors. Pakistan has a weak position to counter the Indian charge.
@LeftwardSwing Right, I didn't intend to imply that there were NIMBYs in the community, but rather in city hall. They seem to be on the fence about how much of a good thing is too much.
@TheEconomist I'd pay good money to see what my immigrant ancestors, with names like Jakob (Fey), Stephen (Hopkins), Michael (Hardman), Peter (Mowers) &amp; Pieter Wyckoff would do to anybody who suggested they weren't individualists.
@LeftwardSwing So then what's City Hall doing? It seems like the policy is designed to make sure that only people who are already on an upward trajectory can live there. Seemed like classic NIMBYism to me. What am I missing?
@respecteconomy I just skipped through the video and I heard "graph paper, after lunch, therefore I am"		Truly wise words!
@Pachacutec_ @michaelwhitney your dog checks out, pooch is compelling Mike to do the right thing
@LeftwardSwing NIMBYs hard at work?
@Appletonwild @Strike4Youth @ChrisGPackham @HollyWildChild @ukycc Schools of course operate under the expectation that they will not let students wander off and get into trouble.		As for me, I remember the time I got to B.C.C. a bit late and just walked around in the shrubs outside for half an hour before going in :)
@washingtonpost This is the kind of hard-hitting journalism the U.S. needs right now
@ashleyfeinberg Hate on @TedCruz all you like, but his reaction to @bencarson standing there like a happy lump was perfect.		Carson standing there like he's a Pharaoh thinking about his grain storage.
@axomamma @ole__dave @DavidAstinWalsh @libbycwatson @DanRiffle If "colleagues" are that thin-skinned, they probably need to be rolled around the pasture until they get a good coat going.		Lord knows the tax deal smells bad enough already.
@EdKrassen To channel @SethAbramson I'm less interested in the salacious details, more that this is how far our 'public servants' and certain legal professionals have let affairs slide; suborning perjury &amp; blackmail no longer theoretical concerns but an everyday concern.
@jondpulliam @seattletimes @ByRosenberg The funny thing is that this is just the kind of thing that could possibly rate a criteria, given that this much power is held over the public sphere by Mr. Bezos.		I ain't saying he would, but he certainly could. In the age of Individual-1 we should all be awake.
@CookeWJ1 @ChrisMommsen @RottenInDenmark Quite so, but it puts the lie to the argument that we need special tax giveaways to get companies to go to the places they're already interested in.		Even their official statement in the aftermath of HQ2 Queens is hedging their bets there. They may well end up hiring there.
@DeathMedieval Hi death bot, what's my prognosis?
@veterans_i Of course, Individual 1 is a Very Important Person, so he will get special treatment while this lady from WV will be forgotten and unmourned. Quite the example of "hurting the right people," isn't it?
@veterans_i Speaking of fraud and attacks on the Obamas, Individual 1 is long overdue for his karma check!
@DanKaszeta But you're not being grim and sad all the time! This is the real outrage, not the attacks you expose
@MishaQuinnH @notcawri @DxGGEAUX Pls don't remind me of that story. *shudder*
@sdesai1989 @notcawri omg, can't unsee this. looks grumpier than a @GOP Senator who's about to lose his welfare check
@TheEconomist Why not have some younger people spend some time with the older people? Robots have no needs, but belonging to community is a universal human need.		Unless you're one of those IoT ID=10T types, in which case I have no use for you.
@ChinaPlusNews Seeing this in my Twitter feed now feels like China is roasting the U.S. and I can't say it's entirely undeserved

@Ironyisfunny8 @washingtonpost @BillGates 4/ So climate change is important, but it doesn't prevent us from wanting to help people live better, healthier lives too. As I said earlier I would like to see what @BillGates has to say on this issue. @BillNye, too.
@Ironyisfunny8 @washingtonpost @BillGates 3/ Government and local institutions will still be with us, and there's no reason to think that the challenge of coordinating strategies is beyond us. We can "fart and chew gum at the same time" as LBJ might say (though maybe that's not so good for climate...).
@Ironyisfunny8 @washingtonpost @BillGates 2/ If you have a lot of open ground in, say, Brazil, planting trees is a very effective strategy for lowering temps (through removing greenhouse gases) - this is the part everybody seems to forget. Likewise, good policy in Africa should seek to avoid greenhouse gas-based economy.
@Ironyisfunny8 @washingtonpost @BillGates I was trying to cram too much into that post, so let me spool it out a bit: Every spot on earth has its own unique conditions for policy, even though we have the same challenge globally. If Bill Gates tries to build up African economy, the details determine whether it helps. 1/
@piratefoxy @Ndymium6 @Son_of_Ra999 @Bravewriting @BreakingBrown @tonetalks I think the nightmare scenario of slavery reparations is that you would see relatively affluent folks who have their geneaology tied down would get a pot of money, but then people would demand DNA tests, which are still unreliable - meanwhile we have homeless veterans. Feels bad.
@piratefoxy @Ndymium6 @Son_of_Ra999 @Bravewriting @BreakingBrown @tonetalks Arbitrariness is unavoidable in any plan for reparations and will lead to seemingly absurd policy objectives. It's why I would instead advocate #UBI or policies aimed at people in need, with less complicated gates to qualification &amp; better outcomes.
@TheEconomist Quite a threadbare article. Amazon made clear that they wanted "long-term" support to move forward. They are seeking to dodge taxes and that is the issue. @NPR said that they would "organically grow" their organization, so in the end, we can't even say jobs are lost in the US.
@thc911 @borisdabasher @CarlZha As for peddling the lie that the UN didn't go there because they were "conveniently fired upon," don't be a moron. The UN inspectors only planned to go to areas that the Syrians and Russians declared safe.		You've literally turned this into the UN inspectors vs. Syria &amp; Russia.
@thc911 @borisdabasher @CarlZha These things do not happen in a vacuum. Any competent observer already knew that the Syrian government had a history of overreacting to rebellions, such as with the massacre that ended the Islamist uprisings of the late 70s.		Whether Syria may defend itself isn't the issue.
@timtron2020 @Agent_Hodgo @RussianEmbassy @BBC @Dalatrm @mfa_russia @bbcrussian @BBCWorld @UKSyriaRep @Telegraph @TheSun @DailyMailUK @DailyMirror @Channel4 @SkyNews That's an interesting way of reading the article which is heavily laden with the words "reportedly" and "denied" as well as with descriptions of what happens with sarin and Cl gas exposure, but let's not that stop your rush to push Business Insider as the only source here
@thc911 @borisdabasher @CarlZha This has only been the playbook of strongmen in the region for decades, haven't you been paying attention?		He had cover to punish &amp; execute people who irritate and thwart his authority.
@mollypriddy I wouldn't even call him "patriot prayer guy," just call him what he is.		Not a warm &amp; fuzzy individual.
@timtron2020 @Agent_Hodgo @RussianEmbassy @BBC @Dalatrm @mfa_russia @bbcrussian @BBCWorld @UKSyriaRep @Telegraph @TheSun @DailyMailUK @DailyMirror @Channel4 @SkyNews Nothing in that report contradicts what @Agent_Hodgo just wrote.
@washingtonpost @BillGates For example, following what he's said, micro-loans could be used to buy diesel/gas-powered electricity generators. Roads as well. I'm missing a link but many are starting to wake up to the fact that Western-style consumerism is not the only path forward, and it generates waste.
@ssgsteveh @Bravewriting Hijacked accounts or sleeper bots for troll farms reported behind some of this.		Personally I just respond if I think there is something to learn from the other account, or if they are perpetuating a line I hope to blow up or respond to. Otherwise, I usually just ignore.
@washingtonpost @BillGates' argument is 99% that it's a humanitarian issue, and I think that we can help build economy &amp; infrastructure in Africa without too many environmental impacts. But he needs to flesh out that argument more. It's absolutely key that we don't repeat climate mistakes there.
@EXAIR 2007, silver Motorola Razr that runs BREW apps.		I still use it. Take that, planned obsolescence &amp; e-waste!
@NateSilver538 Could you do a story about American support for gun legislation in the wake of massacres? Heard on the radio that it spiked to 71% after the Stoneman Douglas shootings last year, but has slumped back to 51%.
@Stevietheman66 @Katharine_Mckee @PoliticNonsense @EvanPoulas @arc315 @akarl_smith @AOC People who follow sports deals should find this all familiar. The LASED project (the home in 2020 LA for the Chargers and Rams) is breaking with the longstanding grift where taxpayers fund the stadiums. Instead, the project is being privately funded.
@PoliticNonsense @arc315 @Stevietheman66 @EvanPoulas @Katharine_Mckee @akarl_smith @AOC This makes sense if you continue to studiously ignore structural effects, which you seem intent on doing. A "low-skilled" worker in a non-union shop vs. the management - you tell me, who wins? And why do they need our help in pulling the levers available to them?
@Danishova @BnehpetsB @ZVanDenBosch @Meancupjoe @kkg63 @ArtieKGB @akarl_smith @AOC Can you walk and chew gum at the same time? We can target both.		No doubt there are some challenges and I've got reasons to be skeptical about the current GND proposals, so there's that if you want to run with it.
@Katharine_Mckee @PoliticNonsense @Stevietheman66 @EvanPoulas @arc315 @akarl_smith @AOC No, it was about playing our cities off against each other so that the norm would become "I have a big pot of gold, but you have to pay a fee to get some."
@FeralCat67 @morningmika Get 'em jobs with an employer who won't ask to use your roads for free.

@chrysicat @debraj112 @jbouie I think 'country being fine with dictatorship' would not be a bug, but a feature, for these guys.
@jbouie "May God grant that it was the Communists" - Hitler's first words on arriving at the burnt Reichstag, according to Sefton Delmer, the only reporter on the scene.
@SCJohnson @thegalonthego @HFiskJohnson That's a lot of "small quantity of product, single-use dispenser" on that shelf, there.		I would like to see more products take an approach similar to @methodhome (whose soap is pretty bad, actually) with refills available. Save on packaging, encourage reuse of the dispensers!
@SCJohnson @Claire13323 @HFiskJohnson I see the "reduce and recycle," but what about reuse? And what about opportunities for new kinds of packaging developments, using both new and old materials?
@Personalwetness @HFiskJohnson I think it is not beyond human imagination, but beyond the human fascination with convenience. When people can't find a tap they go find a vending machine and plunk down good dollars (I almost said quarters!) to get slightly chilled tap water in a plastic bottle. I miss glass...
@EdgeLSeawolf @setters99 @HFiskJohnson See your point, but this is a typical garbage headline: Not doing the small things just makes the end result that much harder to get to. The broader point is that many plastics are single-use, just like straws, and find their way into the ecosystem and even table salt.
@Charles29133308 @William_Perrigo @ihatearsenal2 @HFiskJohnson It's always struck me as odd that people go "oh look, I must have modern conveniences" but they also feel underemployed. We could do a lot of good by finding a way to spend a few minutes each week making sure things are routed back into recycling programs.
@AllyMacabre @HFiskJohnson China has stopped taking in many forms of American-origin waste because it simply is not appropriately sorted (all the people who stubbornly put pizza boxes or other oil-contaminated cardboard in the recycling, this is you). It's probably worse for plastic, which is very diverse.
@HFiskJohnson When we are talking about plastic waste strategy, let's not forget that many ecosystems sit on the edge between the waste-producing areas, and the open oceans. We should be careful about "skimming" strategies' potential to harm ecosystems:		https://t.co/K9uxz1ErSw
@JohnCarltonKing @mattyglesias President Obama, the Puny Liberal Man, was conspiring with his Angry Deep State Liberal Doctors to understate his weight and look Glorious Leader look bad when he took office! This is the kind of trickery afoot these days.
@mfinn3333 @EvanPoulas @Stevietheman66 @Katharine_Mckee @arc315 @akarl_smith @AOC I remember the good old days when Trump and the GOP fought against GM's decision to decide the size of its own workforce, on purely business reasons.		The good old days when corporations and companies went American because of our well funded education and infrastructure.
@PoliticNonsense @Stevietheman66 @EvanPoulas @Katharine_Mckee @arc315 @akarl_smith @AOC It's good your Highly Advanced Zombie Brain let you abstract away the entire issue, which is TAXES.

@ArthurF01268895 @Wildfyrewarning @washingtonpost If your "historical understanding" does not include the unlawful Fugitive Slave Acts foisted off on the North by the South, the South's temper tantrum of quitting the democratic process, and does not recognize that abolitionists had clearly made the case against slavery...

@JoshuaParkhurst @akarl_smith @AOC Whatever GND's faults may be, I was not aware that it was enshrining a structural bias towards wealthy interests only.

@EvanPoulas @Stevietheman66 @Katharine_Mckee @arc315 @akarl_smith @AOC Of course that's how it works.

@NateSilver538 Meanwhile, the rest of the country continues to overestimate the importance of Trump.		Good work here, Nate!
@bud_sd @ChasingOz_ @PPFA Your statement ignores the larger context. We have Catholic-run hospitals that have nearly killed their patients because they wouldn't agree to run some procedures. We have a Republican party trying to destroy Obamacare.		We shouldn't allow modern medicine to be whittled away.
@ChasingOz_ @PPFA All this is sacrificed because Republicans want to be able to say to voters that they "ended the problem of abortions once and forever."		Then they can go back to resting on their laurels, doing important things like getting paid by the taxpayer to find more things to politicize.
@Wildfyrewarning @ArthurF01268895 @washingtonpost More to the point, if we are going to try and judge what Lee's moral consideration was when he joined the Confederacy, we can't wave away the facts: It was an unlawful rebellion and it was motivated by slavery and an abandonment of democratic politics. That's not exonerating Lee.
@Wildfyrewarning @ArthurF01268895 @washingtonpost I'm not enough of a Lee historian (and in fact I don't know if anybody can rightly say) whether he thought that he was protecting the South from an overly aggressive North. But, with the benefit of hindsight, we can see that is not what the war really was about.
@BigDub1 @mtaibbi As long as they're not "executed outside the womb," those people should definitely look into signing deals with the young for skin donations. It's a win-win!
@ChasingOz_ I wish the pro-health (which is what it really should be called) side was better at messaging like this.		Ironically, the side that is so keen to try and legislate away the problem of morally &amp; medically complexity have been telling us that you can't legislate away gun violence.
@errollouis But you gotta make sure that Important Friends get their ad buy money, so we can get those hard-hitting political TV ads that everybody loves and that are so influential. Right?

@SethAbramson It's refreshing to see good boys / girls being very good.
@dtomatx @washingtonpost The same "glaring passes" that saw the domination of the media cycle by political theater on Benghazi and Clinton's emails, and now VA Gov. Northam's blackface, Rep. Omar's comment about AIPAC? Meanwhile coverage of racists in the GOP has slid out of the cycle.
@AuschwitzMuseum Hmm. I will have to read on this issue carefully, but it should be remembered that the wrong-headed law passed in Poland makes the Memorial's mission harder to carry out. Let's not forget that issue and to continue to agitate against the denial of this history.
@dtomatx @washingtonpost Anybody can work at redemption - key words - "work" and "redemption."		I'd joke about Rs always being welcome to switch parties, but frankly, if your record &amp; motives are garbage we don't need you representing us.
@washingtonpost "His party" isn't his party, it's the Democratic Party. Whatever happens needs to be for the right reasons.
@washingtonpost Was this driven by Trump, or the other way around?		Or is it just a happy coincidence that President Trump was mouthing this line recently?
@MnDOTtraffic After leaving MI I was so sad not to be reading about I-94 anymore. Thanks for the nostalgia :)
@PopTartsUS Get toasted brah
@NateSilver538 Funny how he's underwater more with the Rs - there's definitely something for the Trumpites to worry about.
@mmpadellan Did he use the word Powerful?		Fine tragicomedy: Staff use a key phrase to keep their guy on script, key phrase turns into a literal hellmouth and eats everything in sight
@uga0802 @CalliopeAnim @libertylatina Those misdemeanors, incidentally, hint that the original charge would have been lying under oath, which is the heart of Rep. Omar's opening statement. The report I linked above makes it abundantly clear that the Reagan Administration was fully aware what they were involved with.
@uga0802 @CalliopeAnim @libertylatina You snitched on yourself when you used the phrase "30-ish years ago." People are still suffering because their loved wives' and daughters' bones lie under dirt in Guatemala, and your argument appears to be that we shouldn't litigate this because he pled to two misdemeanors.

@ewarren Gun nuts, take note: I'm not talking about the protection against lawsuits that seek to punish companies for the misuse of their firearms. I'm talking about how the Remington 700 has been known to fire unexpectedly for longer than most Americans have been alive.

@uga0802 @CalliopeAnim @libertylatina "Rep. Robert G. Torricelli [...] Democratic chairman of the House  subcommittee on Western Hemisphere affairs, pledged this week to "review  every word of the Reagan Administration," adding that he would press contempt of Congress charges against any official who lied under oath.
@uga0802 @CalliopeAnim @libertylatina - accomplice to murder.		Here is Abrams in 1993: "Let them go have hearings," [...] "This is an allegation that  the entire top rank of the Foreign Service is filled with liars. It is a  reprehensible McCarthyite charge."		https://t.co/I1CnKzk5zw
@uga0802 @CalliopeAnim @libertylatina I already did, and your line of reasoning is incredible. Abrams is not a contrite, rehabilitated felon running for dog-catcher, and the House Foreign Relations Committee is an appropriate for its members to air their views on this unrepentant
@TheEconomist You guys are about 12 years late to the party.
@JcStinkens @CourtneyHagle @deepstateop And now Fox and its ilk have decided that the way to make right is to decide that Oliver North needs a patsy, too.
@CourtneyHagle I wonder if President Reagan would have been pleased by President Trump's close ties to an old KGB man. F&amp;F picked a good time to dust off the ol' Red Scare, didn't they?
@maggieNYT Ah yes, you see, this goes right to the @GOP talking point that all Obama does is apologize for US policy.		Wait, wrong Barack? Oh.
@PhilStefans @Billbrowder Not just that, but Russia was unsubtly using gas deliveries as a cudgel against Ukraine as long as it sought ties to the West, and of course those gas deliveries were being made in the dead of winter. This was well over 10 years ago.
@Billbrowder I would say "it's all about the gas deliveries" but somebody might call for my head!
@uga0802 @CalliopeAnim @libertylatina So what is the place of public hearings then? Not to call out the actual tract record of a man convicted in the aftermath of the Iran-Contra disaster?
@brhodes Flashback to 2016, when people didn't vote for Hilary Clinton because she would be worse than Trump and/or she wasn't perfect like Bernie.
@Wildfyrewarning @ArthurF01268895 @washingtonpost Exactly, but it's so crucial to revisionist history that they put it right in the name of "the noble cause."		I think Mel Brooks summed it up well: "My fake plants died because I did not pretend to water them." He also has a line about tragedy and comedy...
@PrDrJ @deuxmarshmallow @Jim_Jordan The irony is that Jim Jordan - and you - have apparently forgotten that Cohen can be rung up on new charges if he steps out of line again.

@Jim_Jordan So I'm sure you will use your powers to full effect, making sure that no new lies appear on the record.		Or will you just interject repeatedly with whining about rules and witch hunts?
@GeorgeTakei "Finish President Obama's wall" has a kind of ring to it, don't you think? I'm sure Trump would love that.

@ArthurF01268895 @Wildfyrewarning @washingtonpost I would hope to be judged as one who learns from the past, whose conception of loyalty was to the greatest part of mankind.		Again, I think Lee himself was somewhat resigned to the reality of being on the losing side. Attempting to rehabilitate his record does him no justice.
@waltshaub @aedwardslevy Underrated comment!
@SAWEvans At the risk of foolishness, it seems to me that we have two options: Either "steal harder" or undertake a sweeping policy of discriminating against academics and companies based on their origin and ties. I don't think democratic soft power is a tenable solution to this problem.
@SAWEvans Unfortunately export controls seem like shutting the barn after the horses have fled. We have an open society, including academia and our intellectual property system, and these are easy pickings for centralized governments with little interest in reciprocity.
@Wildfyrewarning @ArthurF01268895 @washingtonpost What's worse is that Lee himself made a few small but important gestures to recognize the war was over. The right ignores that and instead holds him up as a tragic noble figure, where the "nobility" was choosing the wrong side and the "tragedy" was losing the fight for slavery.
@Lexialex I can't wait for Polio Tees to be a thing. Thwack!
@ArthurF01268895 @annamaria1word @washingtonpost That's basically "government of men, not of laws." There is a reason we're supposed to have a government of laws, so people choose what is RIGHT over taking the easy route and siding with their friends.
@FryderykJaneck @MaxAbrahms This is one half of what I wish Max could do better.		The other half is what I said before - academia likes, just like everybody else, to pretend that its worldview is paramount. But even-handed judgments never get people excited enough to vote for a new agenda.
@MaxAbrahms And this is why academics never accomplish a damn thing.		Activism is important!

@Hebahersi Back on topic, it's the First Amendment implications that worry me most. It's not a sign of support for Israel that nativists, the GOP base, go into rapture when Trump promises an end to foreign wars. Popular support can't be taken for granted.
@Hebahersi The Atlantic is often good, but they wouldn't run anything about Mearsheimer and Walt except for embarrassing pieces like this:	https://t.co/C5heQE3wp5	(Walt would cover this at the end of October that year.)
@bpickar @mittcoats @AnandWrites As far as your definition of "setting the world on fire," anti-trust laws were there in large part because the nation's been to this show before, with the big railroads in the Gilded Age. The harm's well known. It's not a slam against the good Gates has done in business &amp; phil.
@bpickar @mittcoats @AnandWrites The political version of "crowding out" theory was that government spending and programs restricted private enterprise.  As Paul K. says, there's circumstances where this are true.		However, I think the criticism also works in reverse, when a huge amount of wealth goes to the top
@Trillburne It was everybody, just like Murder on the Orient Express!
@ACGuerrilla @bungarsargon @IlhanMN @PeterBeinart It is interesting to note that the Israeli state maintains a whole series of religious courts, one for each religion. Given certain situations, a person may lose normal protections under the law, (i.e., in divorce proceedings).
@JoshuaParkhurst @bungarsargon @IlhanMN @PeterBeinart From the article: "That doesn’t mean it’s illegitimate to talk about AIPAC’s fundraising,  any more than it’s illegitimate to talk about O.J. Simpson killing a  white woman"		Well, it's good to know we can't unilaterally demand Omar change the subject - in theory. Right? Right :)
@nycsouthpaw Might as well grab some money while this burns to the ground™		His last graf probably has always been true, though that doesn't help his case.
@SethAbramson OK, but you know I'm in favor of fewer billionaires, not more.		j/k you're awesome Seth!
@bpickar @mittcoats @AnandWrites It is precisely the point, and it's applied to Gates just as well as Zuckerberg without malice.		10 years ago Paul Krugman was writing about counters to the "crowding out" effect criticism in the face of recession. Severe wealth inequality seems similar.		https://t.co/JQX2NXnjPA
@kngofstrngs @washingtonpost If your research discovers that CAIR is as effective at blocking dissenting voices - in academia as well as politics - let me know.
@kngofstrngs @washingtonpost What I would really like to see is for policies to succeed on their merits - not based on what's in their name or how much incentive candidates have to please them.		AIPAC has every right to be as aggressive as possible in defending Israel. But it can backfire.
@kazweida It's funny how they also miss the obvious: "They turned away half of the crowd!" But no, can't think that through, can they?		Just waiting for the day when MAGA supporters all crowd a Trump rally and this happens:		https://t.co/kHnnKnFgj4
@washingtonpost I will be "inspired" when our leadership gets serious about promoting peace, does not have a President who provokes his fanatical leaders to shoot up synagogues, and when public servants don't shrink from good policy because powerful interests dislike it.
@washingtonpost Average Americans probably care more about why there is no public effort to justify, let alone have a debate, the ongoing program of US aid to Israel, the latest package a record $38Bn for 10 years - while our own government is shut down repeatedly. This fosters dangerous resent.
@washingtonpost She is being trolled day in and out by supporters of far-right Israel policy who have nothing productive to say about the rights of people illegally evicted from their homes, and the ongoing decay of democracy in Israel.
@washingtonpost I find nothing inspirational in that by touching the third rail - money from lobbying - Omar is being policed far more fiercely than VA Lt. Gov Fairfax, accused of two rapes, or President Trump, who literally used ethnic cleansing and unambiguous slurs as punchlines.
@adanagirl @Tupperwarepanda @EHahnMD @realDonaldTrump This is very similar to a story my own mother shares, right down to the date and the time the little guy survived (13 days). I can only hope that the GOP and anti-abortion activists do not know details of these stories, because the alternative is too ugly to mention.
@EHahnMD @realDonaldTrump Imagine if we referred to palliative, hospice, and end of life care for the ELDERLY as executions!		We allow people to refuse such care. Why? To reduce suffering! Infants can't choose so their parents and doctors must; slandering these people only compounds their heartbreak.
@RedwoodGirl fwiw, 'the strain between our countries' is going to continue as long as Jimmy Carter has to say Israel's policy towards Palestinians is apartheid, and as long as there's a campaign to police the comments of any Americans who dare say that.
@daniel_hervig @NateSilver538 This is it. Talk about not covering the states, etc. misses the point of "The Making of the President 2016." Media have always picked the pot of winners, and putting Trump - or Howard Schultz - is entirely on the media.
@JamilSmith @Yair_Rosenberg If nuance means patronizing Omar, god help us all.		What we need is a policy that promotes peace and the rights of all parties - while also respecting the first amendment rights of people to criticize the influence of money in Congress.
@dcbigjohn But he has his own "Pat Sajak and his partner live in this beautiful mansion" worshipful clickbait, right? That's gotta count for something.

@gindaanis @AmandaDylina The way I would put it is this: She has (she believes) Native heritage and ancestry.		She doesn't have a native identity or have lived a native life. Aside from her (important) family memory of a native ancestor, she doesn't seem to have done much to live her heritage.
@gindaanis @AmandaDylina This is a good point. Commercial DNA tests seem to be pretty bad at anything but white ancestry.
@savtah8 @AdyBarkan But we did see that immigration and an antisemitic suggestion drove one man to shoot up a synagogue last year.		In practice there are always going to be people who are more invested in some issue than others - but I would like to see more focus on antisemitism, including by Omar.
@JLangWood @TheAtlantic @andersen Obviously we're working from the human model, but objective metrics tamp down that possibility.		A good example of this is the "mirror test" as applied to elephants - elephants didn't realize they were seeing themselves until we placed elephant-sized mirrors in front of them.
@TheAtlantic @andersen One of my favorite facts is that fruit flies who were denied sex like to go straight for the booze afterwards
@RealPastaGod @RepSlotkin J Street is pro-peace, not sure that makes sense.
@speculawyer @RepSlotkin We've had months and months of silence and inaction on holding the President and the right to account for hate speech that clearly influenced racist killers, and it was even a topic on MSNBC that "you can't blame the President for this" (as Chris Cuomo put it).

@JuddLegum Yes, the Palestinian Right-of-Return Lobby is too damn powerful!
@chrislhayes Or, the flip side, it can be used as a weapon to shut down viewpoints that are not beneficial to one's beliefs. Posting it again, because it's still the famous case:		https://t.co/UgRt1FYLtT
@LaraFriedmanDC @IlhanMN One also hears that anti-Israel groups harm academic freedoms - this is true, but that did not stop lobbying groups from giving two academics both barrels:		https://t.co/UgRt1FYLtT		The last 10-odd years have borne the authors' criticisms out, and here we are again...
@LaraFriedmanDC @IlhanMN The pro-Israel Lobby is also supporting legislation that censors private citizens, which is already law in 26 states:	https://t.co/A29y4Y4qCn		This may seem benign to opponents and uninterested observers of #bds, but how will we have productive debate by signing away the 1st?
@RepHaleyStevens This is the most thoughtful response to Rep. Omar's statements I've seen so far, but it is worth remembering that the current leadership of Israel has supported illegal settlements. That is not conducive to peace.		It is time to recognize that talk is cheap!
@bstephenmitchel @mehdirhasan I tend to agree, but as the right-wing elements of Israeli politics seemingly have no stomach for trying a sustainable peace solution, we're locked into this kind of aggressive lobbying, until something cracks. One hopes it won't be too big a break, for the sake of all parties.
@ChrisCoons The fact of the matter is that as long as apologists for right-wing Israel policy are given free reign to browbeat any criticism, and you sign onto anti-1st Amendment bills, this "beatings will continue until morale improves" approach makes many Americans less fond of Israel.
@ChrisCoons With due respect, Sen., it was bad enough that you joined the pile-on late. It is worse that you continued to post. Rep. Omar's concerned about the settlement expansions, and about the place of lobbying money in pushing the right-wing policy in Israel, instead of peace.
@lalloronamovie She can have them
@bstephenmitchel @mehdirhasan Unfortunately it's become a weapon. The classic cases are various media "scares," which may be legitimate. The classic academic case surrounds the authors of this book:		https://t.co/UgRt1FYLtT
@AdyBarkan My fear is that, rather like the NRA and 2nd Amendment fundamentalism, pushing money at candidates to support a fairly unpopular foreign policy issue may well be driving anti-semitism amongst average Americans.		It reminds me of the old saying: "Beatings will continue until..."
@stephaniekays @Chemjobber How the hell did this happen?! Open human-sized tank of sulfuric acid, sending fumes everywhere, apparently indoors. Ventillation failure? Or did he just suffer a seizure or other medical condition and no buddy system meant he fell in?		Good old 10 Mile. :(
@mattyglesias If Omar understands the issue as money-based, it is only relevant context that for her party leadership treats Israel as the third rail. It doesn't justify the argument that she should have saved herself grief, because the money clearly is the big issue outside the Beltway.
@brutapologist When is the face going to make his or her big promo? Been waiting for too damn long...getting tired of all these heels :9
@alexkotch The most interesting bit of context is this: They were afraid of setting a precedent on freedom of speech in the King censure motion.		However, keep in mind that the censure is a formal proceeding; the condemnations are not. So this is not equivalent.
@AndrewMannix Basically the unredacted version says that you can hack the system with a bent paperclip, and it has to be rebooted every Friday else it auto-orders a new Mustang for the Chief.		Why a Mustang? Hell if I know.
@HenryPorters "Things get complicated" is a fine way of saying "there is no such thing as a neutral observer." Attempting to pretend otherwise serves no legitimate democratic purpose, and seems calculated to throw the issue back to the veteran pols who treat any Israel issue as a third rail.
@brutapologist Pure 1st Amendment issue here, let's boost this. Top the top it goes!		https://t.co/A29y4Y4qCn

@RawStory Magic 8-ball says: That's a question you should ask yourself!
@brutapologist Nah, Israel policy is one of the third rails of US politics. The shutdown isn't...so far. I'm right until proven wrong on this one.
@skjask There are multiple options available to redress this harm: Compensation or the restoration of the appropriated property.		This suggestion seems to satisfy all of the criteria in your framework without being anti-Semitic, no?
@skjask As a thought experiment, let's say that somebody is concerned entirely with the right of return for Palestinian Arabs who were evicted to clear way for the state of Israel. In that context, "destruction of Israel" is another person's "right to return," i.e. boring real estate law

@HenryPorters I hope you don't mean no additional critics need apply, as material support for Israel is a tax and moral issue for every American. Policy should be well-considered.
@fiondavision @Ilhan @Joshptm Justice is a matter of the heart as well as the mind, and the constant policing of Rep. Omar is crying wolf once again. God help us if trolling Israel critics is the only way to secure Israel's future.
@fiondavision @Ilhan @Joshptm The Anti-Semitic Language Policeman's Union - Bob Normal remembers the time you told him that a Star Wars character was anti-semitic, and Pokemans too.

@fiondavision @Ilhan Also not so nice that Puff Daddy is getting dragged, and "lazy" blacks as @joshptm makes an "unfortunate" point. Leave the brothers alone!
@fiondavision Rep. @Ilhan Omar - you got warned about sticking your face in the hornet's nest before. Why?!		Random Twitter people, it's nice you know trivia about Puff Daddy raps, not so nice you don't know "All about the Benjamins" is something granny busts out to be cute and hip these days.

@CharlieQuimby @FrankLuntz @RBReich Even for this group, there's a huge amount latent power over culture, ready to be exercised on a whim. George Lucas himself recognized the danger of somebody in power deciding that their copyright was more important than the public's right to history:		https://t.co/VjIOsLOEaQ
@CharlieQuimby @FrankLuntz @RBReich Lucas is complicated: He bankrolled Lucasarts to do its own thing, and busied himself with podracer noises, instead of micromanaging his EU licensees.		But he also never apologized to Carrie Fisher for charging her a couple bucks whenever she looked in the mirror.
@CharlieQuimby @FrankLuntz @RBReich Even in the 90s it was nuts how much money in entertainment was revolving around George. Literally hundreds, if not thousands of people were working on the Expanded Universe, and Lucas had veto power over all of it. At the same time, big business was churning out physical goods.

@AmandaDylina You're right, except for one thing: Being native is not identical to being a tribal member. There is a lot of overlap, but those aren't the same either.		Genocide is a complicated thing :(
@CharlieQuimby @FrankLuntz @RBReich I like George Lucas, but you might want to look up his collaborators - Marcia Lucas, Ralph McQuarrie, etc.		I think it's fair to say that monopoly power is involved in the making of these billionaires, although differently than we usually use the word.
@RWPUSA Disingenuous to say that Lt. Gov. Fairfax hasn't been convicted - you know why that is! He never was brought up on charges to begin with!		Beyond that, you make a good argument, but I can't see somebody with those allegations against them continuing on in office.
@rolandscahill But she will clobber him!

@TasteThisSass I don't think prison work / labor is a bad thing on its own - I would take a serious look at banning contracting of prisoners, though.		And obviously there shouldn't be a market for goods made by prisoners who were essentially press-ganged. (ex.: Uyghur prison camp labor)

@JohnCarltonKing What's wrong with Tom Perriello?

@RawStory The thing is that #whitaker is doing a dodge and weave - being just disrespectful and obtuse enough to raise blood pressures, not enough to trigger the Dems holding a vote to put him in contempt.		Ultimately, though, time is on our side. He's gonna have to face the music.

@joshtpm if this happens I'm unfollowing
@StephanieKelton This is pretty good. One question though: At what point do we have to worry about the exchange rate?		Also, I don't yet know the estimated figures for the GND. I think that replacing or refitting every dwelling is a laudable goal; what's the cost (compared to unending war)?

@mitchellreports I followed him just after he posted that :(		Saddened that he left us on a cliffhanger, but hey, everybody lives on.
@SophieWarnes Had to think a moment - isn't the point of a UBI that you DON'T have means testing and paperwork? Surely fraud would be an issue, but no more complicated than Social Security here in the USA, or any other place with a dole system.
@walruslifestyle @RRoundels @lpolgreen Hmm, I thought you were taking issue with his blowing this up in public.		As for the money angle...well, he has hired personal investigators - and the whole Washington Post. So people are naturally talking about that.
@JerryFalwellJr My sixteen-greats granddad Stephen Hopkins would turn you on a spit, chump.

@MarinaHyde That bit about "The Black Community," a "homogenized entity" is a dagger in my heart. Aww!
@Mike_davismix @brianschatz At this point the GND seems like an audition for the big thing. In any case, if the primary challenge works in enough states, then clearly the public appetite for hard goals is there.

@kramsman @msmeganl @ProudResister Not just the overwhelming majority. Think about it in terms like the @GOP "election fraud" scare. When was the last time you heard about a doctor aborting a well-developed fetus? Logic compels me to believe we don't hear of it, because medical ethics prohibit it.

@AM_Colleen @blzrul @SteveScalise If it were that simple: The danger is that @SteveScalise, @RepTomReed and others will create legislation that makes it harder for doctors to intervene when it's necessary.		"Right to choose" talk obscures this. We're talking about pregnancies that won't be successful.
@blzrul @SteveScalise Bingo! You nailed it with the first line!
@SteveScalise Will you go on the record and reveal to the American people whether you support @eugenegu's research to rescue babies suffering heart defects?		p.s. Doctors have medical ethics that prevent "born-alive babies being killed." Stop lying about this!

@nycsouthpaw @huntthesnark @RoigFranzia The ongoing mess over #bds has me convinced that there is an ongoing plot to split the Dem party, apparently on the belief that this is necessary for securing Israel.		It seems like a thin reed to me too, but on the other hand, we're not psychotic.
@nycsouthpaw @RoigFranzia Anybody here a fan of The Sandbaggers?		Seems ripped straight out of the episode "It Couldn't Happen Here," where Burnside asks a foreign intelligence agency for a favor...		https://t.co/mBtqy9Fnj7
@eugenegu Just as I thought. Earlier today I asked why @RepTomReed's bill is not funding similar research. Saddened to see the stark reality of it confirmed.
@Quel_the_hell @kittehdissident @eugenegu Thanks for sticking in there and serving patients faithfully for those 29 years!
@eugenegu Note also: The law as it stands does not require families abandon hope! If a woman decides to try and hold on to a fatal condition, doctors can attempt to help. But they should get the best advice from their doctor about what is and isn't possible given modern medicine.
@GaryBoatman @eugenegu @realDonaldTrump He's doing more good in his time off than all the @GOP members on the public dole, writing bad legislation, blowing up the deficit so they can cut Medicare and Medicaid, and nuke your tax refund.
@eugenegu @realDonaldTrump Anti-abortion laws need to be looked at skeptically, at best, because laws written by people with no medical knowledge present a real danger of criminalizing medically necessary treatments BY MISTAKE. See @RepTomReed's Twitter comment about 'babies surviving abortion' (hunh?)
@eugenegu @realDonaldTrump I've noticed that the medical folks don't often tie this together in basic enough language for the average "concerned about abortion" person. You're doing good work here.		I'd add this: Anti-abortion laws don't need to be written to prevent a rogue doctor.

@SecDef19 In the absence of the INF treaty, it's absolutely critical to push nonproliferation on all fronts so other actors will feel less need to proliferate.		That said, is there any way to look at updating the safety of America's strategic force without triggering an arms race?
@RBharvirkar1 @brendanpierpont @bradplumer @JasonBordoff What kind of costs are we talking about?		A lot depends on the actual home in question. Layout will make some homes much more difficult to upgrade than others. I find it worth wondering if at some stage we're not better served by looking at replacing some older homes outright.
@old_osc Saudi Arabia GAVE US-made equipment to Al Qaeda. It did not end up there by mistake.	https://t.co/OlWnh4fGwc
@_babbyformed_ @KamalaHarris @GOP Thank you for this faithful rendition :)
@AlTrumpTrain @CarolMarieCobb2 @RepJerryNadler The only way Whitaker gets out of testifying is by pleading the fifth, or executive privilege. If he goes for privilege, Congress will win in the courts.		Don't know how you see this as anything but the machinations of a doomed man.
@JohnDingell This is how I want to go out. Lucid &amp; fighting for good until the end :)
@JohnDingell :(		RIP John Dingell, the man, an eternal legend. Let's not stop fighting for universal healthcare!
@owillis I liked Comics Book Guy better when he was a fictional character, too.
@RiseFreeOrg Gah. Sometimes I still have nightmares about studying.		Remember kids, it's almost over with!
@DevoTheBand Wonder how many people are gonna show up with pictures from Ol' Pumpkinhead?
@BarbeckBrenda @twytterbyrdie @RepMarkMeadows @trumps_feed Brenda, this isn't traffic court.
@BarbeckBrenda @twytterbyrdie @RepMarkMeadows @trumps_feed "Collison," huh? Come on, it's called criminal conspiracy!
@AlTrumpTrain @CarolMarieCobb2 @RepJerryNadler Rep. Nadler is the one getting what he wanted, and what the country needs - an appearance by Whitaker tomorrow, to give testimony under oath.
@GOP @Liz_Cheney @GOP is basically saying that they should be able to force a mother to continue to carry a fetus diagnosed with a fatal disease. How is this "protecting babies?"
@PereGrimmer @yhazony @formerleft Neither would OB/GYNs condone such a thing, despite the hysteria from "pro-life" activists. Medical ethics prevents it.		We're talking more about "if God struck down Isaac with a disease that ensured he wouldn't make it to term." Sounds more like Job's family to me.
@JeffBezos I never thought I'd be writing this, but go get 'em Jeff :)
@old_osc You heard the Chief!
@KamalaHarris @GOP voters in this thread pretty triggered by Harris suggesting we do something they claim already is happening.		Wonder what they think about the flip side on emergency abortions - claiming we need laws to prevent something that doesn't happen.
@1990Missmia @WayOfTheSword @Balizon @KamalaHarris Of course not, ideally you should be able to give guns from the moment of conception.
@politico Obviously this isn't socialism. Obviously! ;)		The right choice, however.
@petersagal @PhilipRucker @michaelscherer He's full of beans.

@TPM it begins		may all your wishes come true, @GOP	in commemoration of this epic blowback, have an emoji 🔥		Excellent work, @virginianpilot!
@jewishaction Is this well-qualified individual afraid a subpoena would force him to tell the truth?
@NickHanauer @CNN I don't think "Individual of Means #1" is going to be powerful enough to even be a spoiler. But you know what would help sap this ridiculous "spoiler power" from @CNN? Ranked Choice Voting.		@fairvote has been advocating this for years. Let's do it!
@YAppelbaum The day after the referendum, an online acquaintance wrote that they wanted to see a narrow margin for Remain to send a message to Brussels. I agree there's a democratic deficit, but the EU does not care about Britain's smoke signals. If possible, change will take a long time.
@YAppelbaum Afraid I'm stuck on the idea that the issue is the vote. I agree with MP McGovern about the contradiction in Brexit, but even casual observers realized that Brexit was going to be a catastrophe and the rulebound EU simply is too "deep" for timely responsiveness to members.
@willthomas_usa The sky isn't the limit: When it suits them, developers in NYC flaunt zoning intentions, buy up extra airspace, pollute the skyline, and turn "garbage into gold" with super-tall towers:		https://t.co/09nGo6ogGq
@heyadiana @RashidaTlaib @Ilhan @IlhanMN @RepRashida I was cracking up at their reactions to that horrible speech.
@RepTomRice I don't mean to be snide. For people who are interested to find more - and I'm just learning too - the situation OB/GYNs, and their patients, have been describing sounds like this: The pregnancy won't be successful. The fetus is dying.
@HotlineJosh Are you kidding me? I think it should poll brilliantly. All they have to do is show a first-class regional rail system, like @db_blog (Deutsche Bahn), and compare that with having your sinuses exploded every time you want to go anywhere. No contest!		Will need cost breakdown ofc.
@JanetSt0831 @RepTomRice I've got OB/GYNs here on Twitter saying this does. not. happen.		It does not happen for the reasons you and the good Representative are angry about it!		If @RepTomRice wants to improve outcomes, let's invest to help save fetuses and babies!
@RepTomRice The phrase "born alive after an abortion" suggests you have no idea what you're talking about. Go talk to some OB/GYNs please.
@morgfair @thedailybeast Justice Dept. up against justice
@onehumanbean @TopherSpiro Yes, and there's also a trend of conservatives using DNA tests and fighting against protected communities / affirmative action.		Pretty strange to see tweets from people pretending they have the interests of sovereign nations at heart, and then post racist memes of Indians
@adakole_ok Here is an example of typical Sowell:		https://t.co/9VjkzSn0ew		Putting aside the morass of vaguely related logical threads, you'll notice his conclusion is totally empty of positive policy prescriptions. His agenda is usually destructive in this fashion.
@adakole_ok Ironically, I always felt Sowell was a key illustration of his maxim. While he has had a distinguished academic career, usually his opinion pieces go off the rails in drawing unsubstantiated conclusions, and denouncing liberals while not providing credible alternatives.
@siano2020 I do not agree it should be legal while the insurance industry &amp; doctors may possibly have incentive to falsify records &amp; terminate a patient.		I believe single-payer should improve the situation.
@AsteadWesley Seriously, though, maybe we should be crowd-sourcing Dem oppo research on yearbooks since this was a coordinated attack on the Dem party in VA - not excusing the mistakes, but let's be clear - what a hill to die on
@george_capen Astounding how many people watched the response, given how late Trump's speech wrapped up on the East Coast. I think many people just quit after the hour mark,.
@george_capen I was thinking Anita Hill too, but his treatment of Ruth Bader Ginsburg in her confirmation hearing was meant in part to make up for that, so he showed some growth even back in the 90s on this issue.
@MuseWendi Hi there, I will be pleased to vote for you for Governor in the general election...if @tomperriello sits this one out that is ;)
@davematt88 @h8Wankmaggot45 Yeah, but maybe it's not pure and he wants it driven away.		Racists are always punching upward!
@imillhiser Correction: The soldiers were just dead Union soldiers, not any specific race. I haven't seen the actual photo. This was roughly 1979, 1980.
@ndrew_lawrence Even President Donald's #sotu said there's strength in diversity. Damn, none of these people even know what the script is anymore!
@ardengnome @kevdog @pattonoswalt Then we'll watch as President Trump actually goes down the tunnel, fade to black
@RogueEvildoer Shit, we're screwed.
@politico Opinion: Rich Lowry has been filling my inbox with hilarious bizarro-world bad takes for years just fine.		I think @politico jumped over 10 sharks and dunked them into one of those short hoops you put over office wastebaskets.		Awful articles this week. https://t.co/3eCuvLkw8Q
@Things4WhitePpl I think you misspelled "making North American wildlife extinct"		Man, this account takes me back, though!
@beenie48cf @Dgordon621 @RealCandaceO Sheeple is when you stand and clap for President Trump claiming that the death of the INF treaty is a good thing. Literally being herded to the slaughter!
@DrJenGunter good doggies &gt; bad elephants

@normcharlatan @Trillburne @pareene I think the "lady with the tapes" in the Nixon White House really wanted to take Pat's place...
@kerdubs Twitter always blows up the most SAVAGE things!
@Datasmum @SusanoftheLanes @MSNBC And nobody should be spouting this "only tribal members are natives" nonsense! Keep honoring your ancestors. The Cherokee Nation's policing of this issue is making me ill. They look opportunistic here.
@MSNBC In her attempt to keep running @SenWarren is now selling out the many non-tribally enrolled Native people in the country.
@JohnDingell Taking this moment to follow you. Shoulda done it years ago! Be well.
@Dgordon621 @RealCandaceO It's called coordination - a concept foreign in the days of Twitterin' Donnie, but still useful.
@valtha_nerf @mcmoynihan They woulda earned me the academic death penalty. Does your institution expel students for plagiarism? Or are you talking about new students not familiar with The Rules?
@george_capen @DonaldJTrumpJr Surprised Donald didn't say it's measured by how many arms control agreements you let John Bolton blow up, or how many big game animals you slaughter.
@Chinchillazllla She looks like a cockatrice?
@CNN Looks like this blew up on Japanese twitter?		Anyhow, this is a real reason we ought to be careful on sprawl. Gotta have wild spaces for them puddy tats, big or small.
@FillOaks Her daughter knows better.
@LouisRBridgema3 @Mimirocah1 @jkbjournalist Thanks for reminding me that there is a troubling previous connection between Epstein, Dersh, and President Trump. They were close for years, and Dersh was part of Epstein's public defense team. Awful that the networks continue to have him on with no disclaimers.
@PjDanielson @GOP @kayleighmcenany @RickSantorum I don't care.
@TrumpsTies It's Pelosi's Tie now!
@HvacmogulRader @ByRosenberg @benshapiro No, this is "the bigger stage." Good thing we inherited some good habits from the Enlightenment and Revolutionary Age.		Still really damn bad though.
@_cingraham These are generational bootstraps.
@PrettyBadLefty Did that pic get cribbed from Wikihow?
@GOP @kayleighmcenany What a remarkable fire in a dumpster! Donny fix your tie!		Even your man @RickSantorum said it was the worst speech he's heard.		Also, Nixonian threats about investigations are part of the party platform now? Cool, cool
@fyrewulff @taddtorborg @shutupmikeginn Also telling: The rich used to push the "crowding out" theory, which is basically the reverse idea - that the government could get so big that private investment would be harmed
@brundolfsmith @shutupmikeginn That's literally what @paulkrugman has been saying for years now!
@shutupmikeginn How about letting people buy bigger wallets? The wallets would actually be shares in a public good, like Goron wallets for public works.		Also I learned that rich people used to create companies to pay themselves a salary, which is hilarious		https://t.co/uFgrwis85c

@imillhiser At roughly the same time my parents decided to go into a "museum" of the Civil War in NoVa. Had a photo of dead black soldiers on a battlefield, with a caption describing "crows."		One day I came home from childcare, asked my parents what a Damn Yankee was. (Northern parents.)
@fusepark @imillhiser Nope

@TrumpsTies I thought this was a parody account!
@dgmiller13 @matthewamiller @JoyceWhiteVance Donald rides alone, I think. I think his tie went crooked when he flopped into The Beast.
@jbouie The issue is that unless a bunch of dirt comes out on Republicans, naturally this will be used for campaign ads		Ironically this might lead to the state starting to run more transplants, hastening the demise of the local dialect in public service.

@AnandWrites It's a hokey cliche, but - what doesn't kill you will make you stronger. #worthit
@JonathanPtrck Both these moments were depressing.
@DrJenGunter @jack fwiw, I think it's good to look over the occasional typo.		An edit button would let our public servants alter the public record. Especially important when there is a real concern about President Trump's compliance with the Presidential Records Act.
@OverUnderClover @DrJenGunter @AOC seems to have scored some points on prescription drugs, the #BorderWall debate may help settle down some of the anti-immigration sentiment while making the hardcore white nationalists love their cover.		I think that sunlight is the best disinfectant, here. I'm concerned too.
@DrJenGunter The #1 intervention will be ousting this President and the people who seek to politicize medicine. Go blue!
@shaunking Meanwhile, we're still waiting to hear about North Carolina's 9th district election - a case of apparent fraud affecting MANY ballots and perhaps even past races!		https://t.co/m0wmv3qdJI
@Erica_DSW @pappadoc65 @DrJenGunter @ZerlinaMaxwell Thanks to you all for helping educate me, and others.		Families and especially women shouldn't be treated like filth for seeking medical care!
@mattyglesias NPR ran a piece a while ago about this trend, and they correctly ended up dating it to Newt Gingrich, playing back some audio of him saying "the country can't sustain $350M deficits year after year!" - in 1986.		Of course Newt liked that $2T increase to the deficit for tax cuts.
@cassiehines1 @basedideologue @OKeijiDragon @MrWyattLA @AOC @mattyglesias @GovernorVA The good thing about your conga line of emoji is that I can't even click back to the thread you were replying in, thus giving me a convenient excuse for continuing to ignore you
@MrKireko Looking forward to the Trump and Pence Minus Trump and Pence version of this strip. Nothing left but the faint odor of hamberders and brimstone.
@Matt_Freije @tokyo_vamp @MrKireko ...and Ice-Nine seems like what we're actually getting with a Presidency that includes Trump, Pence, John Bolton, Andrew Wheeler at the EPA...
@EricLabRat it's okay, you've served yourpenance
@BulletproofFar @basedideologue @OKeijiDragon @MrWyattLA @AOC @mattyglesias @GovernorVA "I can't be bothered to read the news" is not a topic, sorry.		I'll pass on having you QAnon'splain' to me why the FBI's "witch hunt" is not the most successful hunt for witches ever.
@RawStory Brit Hume looks like 1963, too.
@paulkrugman The one good thing about living in the Neocon Age is getting to read @paulkrugman being savage on the bastards. :3

@Yankmycranks @EdKrassen He's gonna have the last laugh over this, though.
@Yankmycranks @EdKrassen I had to laugh at Bernie feelin' burned, admittedly.
@PalmerReport Hmm, I was hoping for a bit more punch to this one. Still, can't find fault with the https://t.co/aBHyKiDbkF = Kremlin line here.
@EdKrassen tbh, I was rather surprised she stood for President Trump's "America will never be a socialist country" line. Which, also, was a bad line.
@mmfa Of course Fox would like the part where Trump claims "you can't have peace with investigations." Gotta let the Fox watch the henhouse.
@Sifill_LDF Yeah, I can see these folks advocating for the Dr. Swift proposal sincerely.
@Gregmaccyd @Just_Some_Bot @BottomfedBuddha Defunding Planned Parenthood is a good thing? Nope!		https://t.co/gUK6Wv5u4g
@basedideologue @OKeijiDragon @MrWyattLA @AOC An American who is under investigation, keeps his talks with Vladmir Putin secret from the American people, wants more money for a wall than for cancer (h/t @mattyglesias), and is "uniting" by claiming @GovernorVA wants to murder babies
@GOP @realDonaldTrump Wrong.
@mattyglesias The number was $500M.		Detail aside, thanks for connecting these together! (I also wonder why we can't have a big pot of money for treating all cancers, to be disbursed as appropriate. Doing it piecemeal like this seems dumb.)		https://t.co/rNad6QKpLE
@disco_socialist don't forget that Mike Pence shutting down Planned Parenthood to own the libs caused an HIV epidemic as well		https://t.co/8YCA1kGQm3
@mtaibbi In retrospect, there shoulda been a market for "tie straight / crooked"		I think that unceremonious flop into the Beast limo did him in
@WazzuCoug94 @ezraklein IIt's pretty dangerous to say you know what President Trump wants. Even more telling than his "chain migrated" in-laws, he's claimed to want to reduce illegal immigration - and specified that it will help get Americans better jobs - but his own businesses didn't until recently.
@ezraklein Glad somebody else caught that!		So it was an ad-lib, huh?
@30atv @sunchick8 @BreedaBwhitmore @AmyEGardner "intent to fraud people" there's your problem, sir
@BreedaBwhitmore @AmyEGardner Quite possible he does, and it's just not showing up on the tests.
@derekchad @UweBollocks Ben Carson's too busy working on his pyramid scheme to be offensive, right?
@UweBollocks tbh, if we were in a situation where everybody died from President Trump's Agent Orange poisoning, we'd probably just punch Rick Perry and let Stacey Abrams be President
@UweBollocks https://t.co/luo5lcrAlR
@teacherken @MattBinder @edgery and @SpeakerPelosi
@IanCutress Fight the good fight, Ian!!
@veterans_i @AOC looked great! Obviously disappointed at times such as when @SpeakerPelosi clapped for Trump's dumb "USA will never be socialist" line.
@politico The first half of the speech had some OK moments, but surely you missed the part where the President called @GovernorVA a baby killer.
@tonyposnanski Oh, he knew he was being mocked
@realDonaldTrump wants immigration into the country "in greater numbers than ever before." Immigrants add diversity and strength to the nation!		But, also, immigrants are causing great crime! Here's some people, please stand up, crime from immigrants!		Hmm...policing, or a wall?
Right now it looks like President Trump's plan is continuing to give the #SOTU until 2024. He can't be impeached if he's filibustering the entire government, right?
@MattDav72811123 @realDonaldTrump Hey, are you *The* Matt Davis?		Good luck, don't get fooled again.
@RawStory I'm kinda triggered at the choice of tweets in the story (for totally non-selfish reasons). There were so many good dunks on N.G. on this one, most of those didn't even rate xD
@jbouie The fact that he powerwalked his way out of this mess, that's why he deserves the medal, right?
@richieri1318483 @CAAttorney1 @StevenTDennis Misreading both, I'm afraid.
@jeff_ucsu98 @StevenTDennis fightin' the good fight for the boys back home :(
@benitri @StevenTDennis Remember eminent domain!
@StevenTDennis Also, after $2T added to the deficit in just two years, is there any possible upside to letting the GOP score another fake dunk at the cost of taxpayer money? This isn't business as normal, even if we take the shutdown and hostage-taking out of the equation. Trump holds no cards.
@StevenTDennis I can think of one thing that Trump can't offer that he needs to offer: A rational offer that he will actually keep open
@Brad_Reloaded @Bradybuzz So basically you're concerned that any attempt at regulation will be used as a cudgel against responsible owners, right?		But let me put it another way - is there any time when you would think "baby, mattress, gun on floor" and not find that irresponsible - negligent even?
@yannikyriacos @7NewsBrisbane I think it's actually weirder with him obviously trying to hide behind her, and she just trying to be like "alright girls, that's enough, but good job, but please, enough"
@Brad_Reloaded @Bradybuzz Just to rehash: Deterrence is a theory of law. People aren't likely to do dumb things if they know they can go to jail.		Sure, firearms owners are smart enough to know what their needs are. But you can't leave a gun on the floor with a baby crawling around, right?
@petersagal Kids love game shows, the idea is dynamite! It would be a good way to grow @NPR too.
@korrupted @BenjaminJS @SpeakerPelosi I mean, if Trump can spoil Santa at age 7, I guess you're right.
@Brad_Reloaded @Bradybuzz I don't speak for the Brady Campaign and they might have these storage laws in mind. As for me, I think that if a person is negligent and that causes a harm, they should be punished. Right?		If somebody is shot by a ND, chances are good that they go to the hospital &amp; police.
@lrbt @TimOBrien @dabeard Donald Trump had a pretty good sob story of his own...about bone spurs.
@cheryl62482466 @TimOBrien I wonder if he's not proud to own that one, or just forgot about it.
@breathless2 @TimOBrien What do you hear if you play him speaking backwards?
@Brad_Reloaded @Bradybuzz I'm sure you'll be pleased to know that yelling fire in a crowded theater actually did not lead to a conviction, even though such an act probably caused the death of 73 people, mostly children, in the Italian Hall Disaster of 1913.
@Brad_Reloaded @Bradybuzz You should read that article. Censorship is not the same as prosecuting somebody who 1) did something reckless they knew could cause harm, and 2) something actually harmful did happen as a result.		You seem to be advocating get-out-of-jail-free theories here.
@mattyglesias Good thing the House Dems are already working on a Green New Deal. Frankly, the astounding amount of flak being prepared for their effort means it probably wouldn't be very fruitful to make it a campaign season issue. Doesn't mean it won't be on the agenda.
@LotionDolphin @OsitaNwanevu https://t.co/Z3pOWzEqUN
@TopRopeTravis Reminder: Wild animals stay outside ALL THE TIME! If possible, do something to help your local wildlife adapt.		It's probably going to be hot this summer. If you have a bluebird house, consider insulating it a bit to help them escape hot temperatures.
@TopRopeTravis The dog also didn't eject the cat from its vehicle and force it to walk home.		Good doggy!
@RawStory I'm not so sure about this treatment plan. Liam might want to get a second opinion on that - strong hint.		Excellent headline writing.
@politico I was murmuring in dreamless, restless sleep: "Oh no, Lisa, be the maverick we all deserve! Be a check on the worst President of modern times when it's not too politically inconvenient!" Then I'd wake up with a start. But the nightmare was waking.		Is this Politico or @people?
@earthdogelevena @BeliaCoaz @Bravewriting As far as apologies go - Bernie's been doing his independent thing for years because he saw all the corporate donors and so on. So he's old, set in his ways, and mistrustful of playing ball. I think Dem party members will see through him there.
@earthdogelevena @BeliaCoaz @Bravewriting Well, I thought the First Amendment promotes an INclusive, not EXclusive, dialogue. Bernie's not a magician but he shifted the party platform in 2016.		(This reminds me of Berners giving me flak for going to Clinton because of how committed they were to feelin' the Bern.)
@TPointManc @TPointEton @PointPeckham Spicy, like a good vindaloo!
@TPointManc @TPointEton @PointPeckham Did your uncle use a cigarette butt, too?		Good memories.
@earthdogelevena @BeliaCoaz @Bravewriting I have faith in Stacey and Kamala, and all our other candidates. I don't see how one old man is gonna derail them :)
@AnandWrites Examples: Workers at Foxconn exposed to solvents. Barefoot Indians combing through e-waste mountains. A Chinese village covered with ash from a nearby factory. The tainted milk scandal. No cleanup at Bhopal. Sanlitun/Dongcheng "cleaned up" at the expense of small businesses.
@AnandWrites There's also an "unholy confluence" of those two trends - and others - in what reporting I've seen: Corruption still reigns in many areas; environment and health take a nosedive in areas targeted for production, as "tragedy of the commons" is ignored outright.
@Brad_Reloaded @Bradybuzz See also: Free speech limitations. The First Amendment guarantees free speech - but not freedom from consequences for abusing that right, like yelling fire in a crowded theater.
@Brad_Reloaded @Bradybuzz If I'm the victim of negligent firearms handling, I (or my survivors) would certainly consider it highly relevant that case be prosecuted - if for no other reason than to deter such carelessness in the future!		I don't think consequences for actions are bad.
@ThePoke I thought he was a dinosaur though?
@paulkrugman Voight-Kampff?		Also, wait, how is this just now something you're running into? I saw an article recently describing the open secret among money managers - they were managing their clients as if they were stereotypical spoiled rock stars with no sense of anything but excess.
@Brad_Reloaded @Bradybuzz Coming back to your post - gun registration &amp; door to door aren't necessary to prosecute somebody who is responsible for a harm due to blatant negligence. An obvious example - somebody leaves a gun on the floor, child finds it and shoots somebody. That should be prosecuted, no?
@Brad_Reloaded @Bradybuzz You will remember, of course, that President Trump had it wrong: "Take the guns first, go through due process second." Mike Pence tried to help him out, even.		https://t.co/fE8D9EEiGm
@Brad_Reloaded @Bradybuzz Remember Jeff Cooper's four rules? (Or S&amp;W's five?) Firearms owners already self-police on safety. So this isn't a traditional issue of "enforcement" for me, but we need people in the public sphere advocating these rules well, instead of just saying "I stopped the gun grabbers."
@Brad_Reloaded @Bradybuzz Strictly speaking yes, but underpinning it is a wrong belief. We have more than two options - "total police state with GPS guns database" vs "total chaos."		Prosecutors currently can bring charges against reckless owners.		Firearms owners should also self-regulate for safety!
@JessSchrader22 @hartsa13 @RepSwalwell @staceyabrams @SenSanders The last important thing is that Bernie is getting junked by people who fear he is going to spoil the race. I think we're all committed to seeing Trump out of office by 2020 - Bernie will do the right thing for the country, if it comes to that, as should all the Dem challengers.
@JessSchrader22 @hartsa13 @RepSwalwell @staceyabrams @SenSanders Thanks :) A lot of people hating on Bernie forget that it must be quite deflating to have spent years saying the right thing - and oftentimes quoting MLK directly - only to have your position suddenly mainstream, and the social justice crowd claiming you're actually racist.
@MichaelWBeyer @mattyglesias "Root causes" don't help people with depression NOW. They won't help people who are fighting with the current crop of SSRIs. This is not an appropriate venue for either-or thinking.		There's also more to it than the class struggle, too. Example:	https://t.co/FbbwDmN2J9
@HenryPorters @mattyglesias Agreed. I had to look far into the comments to find somebody who wasn't offering some variant of "this is pushing pills" or "the talking cure, the wonder therapy." It's a treatment option, and people with depression are very aware that mainstream treatments are ineffective or bad
@meelar @DemocraticLuntz @mattyglesias I was surprised to see that gun ownership was actually at a 40-year low in 2016.		Nevertheless, firearms access is a suicide risk.	https://t.co/Dij5FkwM7s
@mattyglesias The "but" is misplaced here. People with mental health issues need all the help they can get, and they needed it years ago.
@olwyngdh @Bravewriting When in doubt, assume people don't understand anything.
@BeliaCoaz @Bravewriting As a Bernie lover and sometimes Bernie apologist, you're right. We all need to put down our pointy things and forget about "the one true candidate" or whatever - and let the campaigns go.		#Kamala2020 for me.
@BFinnegan @RevDrBarber Good to keep your eyes on the prize @tomperriello! It's about making the state stronger.		When I was in Michigan, I experienced the Enbridge pipeline spill. I don't want that to happen ever again, and it's not better if it "just" happens in a different community than mine.
@Normegian @GuyEndoreKaiser @RepSwalwell @staceyabrams How can Bernie speak about what he values if he's got to sit down? Everybody has the right to voice their agenda - especially since he's indie.		I don't think Bernie's throwing shade at Stacey Abrams. He's just going to keep carrying the torch 'till the end of days. That's OK.
@JessSchrader22 @hartsa13 @RepSwalwell @staceyabrams @SenSanders My take on it is that Senator Sanders spent years in the political wilderness, doing his own thing, and now he's starting to see it grow. He didn't get to be President, but he does still have a platform to promote those ideals. I think he should use it.
@CDBHinthehouse @RepSwalwell @staceyabrams @SenSanders Was he asking for any? I thought his thing was going to be online only.
@jncohen @Pckennedy11 @juliettekayyem @realDonaldTrump But apparently Trump's supporters are supposed to buy into the theory that they can't think about how to build an air cannon, buy a drone or ladder, or a shovel.
@TPM Racist grifters wonder why Democrats can't just put up with a little grift. "It's like free money, you get paid to set yourself up with a lobbying job for life"
@tchackys @politico Don't we, though!
@hshaban Yes, this shows why it's important to have billionaire identity politics.

@NiteStarLights @Orwell_2012 @TweetOfSpirit @realDonaldTrump When I'm not satisfied I don't invite Jeff "children belong in cages" Sessions to the Administration. Nor do I spend a year passively-aggressively bitching about the Attorney General I did put in place.

@maryderrickart @DemWrite Don't forget ALL the judges put on the bench - especially the Federal bench, traditionally the last stop on the way to the Supreme Court - who were rated "not qualified" by the American Bar Association:		https://t.co/PqJpONeOhk
@mericanViolence @politico Republican operators are angling to destroy the Democratic governor's administration, it's fairly obvious.		@LGJustinFairfax's office has a statement on this, saying that @washingtonpost and other news outlets have declined to run the story given "inconsistencies" in the claim.
@politico Here is the succession to the Governorship, according to the VA Constitution:		- Lt. Gov.	- Attorney General	- Speaker of the House		https://t.co/SnVcMD8YdZ

@politico Replace "oil, gas and coal" with just "coal" and you'll see how this works. Now, whether renewables will fall in price enough to combat cheap oil for energy (and plastic) remains to be seen.		It's a big lift, no need to make it harder from the word go.

@BenjaminJS That awkward moment when you realize you compared @SpeakerPelosi's House chamber to a porn set		But it was a good effort.
@ebruenig I still don't get the "controversy." He's an elected official, she's an elected official, they both have an opportunity to speak on behalf of their constituents, why not let that happen?
@Orwell_2012 @TweetOfSpirit @realDonaldTrump I'm sure this is why the White House is famous for its unity, and all former staffers have said it was the highlight of their careers.		For example, Jeff Sessions has said that he was pleased by the way @realDonaldTrump always appreciated his efforts for the conservative cause.
@subareader @TweetOfSpirit aka small-d democracy at work
@JShahryar BTW, I frame this as societal because one sees this sort of thing with all kinds of communities. Many people panicked over Jews, or homosexuality, marijuana users - the list goes on. The people promoting these ignorant scares are responsible too.
@JShahryar This is why I hate the "diversity causes problems" attitude - Liam's hate for a rapist should be for the crime, not for the thought that the rape was caused by an assailant's race. Society should embrace others.		The first step for Liam was self-restraint. Then take the next...
@LLavamor @michiokaku All hail xenu?		BTW, having lots of fun with .hack//GU right now, which is surprisingly thoughtful about many of the issues transhumanism raises.		On the other hand, aliens could look like low-energy photons dissipating into space after entropy takes its course...sorry guys.
@Brad_Reloaded @Bradybuzz How so?
@rickhasen What has changed is that we no longer live in a country where Superman is used to fight the Klan. We live in a country where youth with racist opinions are simply diverted into taking their opinions underground, instead of being properly taught and led.
@TLeeWashDC @rickhasen Agreed completely! Precedent makes it harder to roll the boulder uphill again, as Courts are often indifferent to challenges to their authority, no matter outside consensus. Add to that the Trump Administration's unprecedented push to add poorly ABA-rated Federal judges.
@FrannyWild @partlowj So this is up to the Executive branch? ^_^; forgetful me.
@NTSB PTC is a must-have feature. However, do we have assurances that PTC not only "fails safe" but that it also is unlikely to be easily disrupted? Complementary GPS-based, and physical PTC systems could be used to improve infrastructure reliability and proof it from attacks.
@NTSB I am particularly interested in the issue of dependability of offline systems; currently, there are many people talking about infrastructure-dependent autonomy and collision avoidance, but reliance on outside data may present a new threat vector - hacking and data corruption.
@NTSB Thank you for writing this. This is but one out of many reasons why we need to rethink the modern regimented, by-the-clock approach to life, especially for youth;		https://t.co/FbbwDmN2J9		h/t @aeonmag
@KailiJoy It's good everybody is on board with the "united Democratic party" theme, but there's no reason why members - even less independents like Bernie who were shouting into the abyss for years - can't get out there and speak for their constituents as well.		Eager for @staceyabrams!
@MikeyGeeeeeeeee @mikesilva @AnandWrites @AOC I don't disagree with you, and I'm pretty upset over the fake outrage over Bernie's presser.		I think that the Democratic party needs to be unified this time, and we can be. I know why he's an independent and respect it, but things are moving quickly.
@partlowj We can't let them bury this. Where are the legal consequences for violating the law?

@JamieIseler @billlascher @greenfield64 @paxr55 Incidentally, the story goes that Winston Churchill faced a critical test on maps, and gambled on the section chosen, studying just one in-depth.

@JamieIseler @billlascher @greenfield64 @paxr55 To win tenure you only have to pass some tests and win a popularity contest at your insitution - and it's remarkable more academics don't turn out to be total characters.		Gingrich never got tenure, though, and his academic work was undistinguished.

@JakeSherman @FLOTUS @realDonaldTrump has had over two years to stand up against bullying. Many of the culprits have been taking their cues from him.		He is not talking about the "very fine people on both sides" this time, because it doesn't suit his white fright.

@stormcoinc @JoeNBC That's a pretty healthy shade for Good Genes President Guy!
@mikesilva @AnandWrites I see what you're saying, but never forget that the parties serve the people - not the politicians.		I'm sure I'm being naive and optimistic here, but let's not forget that @AOC and others are doing just as good as Bernie, while having a lot of appeal to the rank and file voters.
@rebeccaballhaus @TMannWSJ Trump doesn't like infrastructure?		Makes perfect sense to me.
@PalmerReport Drained batteries?
@OsitaNwanevu Basically this is old news, with both factions from the failed '16 bids still at each others' throats, when they shouldn't be.		Bernie's gonna Bern, is all.
@mikesilva @AnandWrites I think Bernie is fine doing his thing - but Anand's post speaks to a continuing problem with some Berners - the belief that the Dem party owes something to Bernie because he helped change the platform (the reverse attitude is also true, of course). He's an independent.
@stefdunk @Bravewriting I was also reminded of the old quote (from the 70s?) that "racism equals power plus prejudice," which sounds like a corruption of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr's line, "the inseparable twin of racial injustice is economic injustice" (from his first book, written in 1958).
@stefdunk @Bravewriting Yes. You don't need propaganda to provoke racism. I heard a recent study found racist attitudes appearing solely from people being presented with evidence of Others doing well, so a big part of it is competition.		It's not class, but it is a power relationship.
@liliiilllliiili @Laker622 @RichardMilhousN @FiveThirtyEight @NateSilver538 It's a corruption of a line from Martin Luther King Jr's first book: "the inseparable twin of racial injustice is economic injustice." Note that he says TWIN, not THE CAUSE OF.
@iammaxhailme @FiveThirtyEight So you would be OK if the governor decided he was anti-First Amendment?		Because hey freedom of speech lets him do that.		The issue here is having consequences for free speech, and maintaining the dignity of the office.
@BenchBobbitt @AOC We install some solar panels sideways and tell Trump it's his wall. GOP will stumble over themselves to throw another $2 trillion at it
@TPGLA1 It's like his body is ashamed of his head and is trying to draw it back under the neck, Mitch McConnell-style
@stefdunk @Bravewriting What the Irish suffered was white-on-white racism, and it featured in American political life even in the 1920s. Worth noting that Irish immigrants were often slaves in all but name. Progress is really slow.		I agree that we don't beat racism by pretending it's just class.
@elcaballodavid @SenSanders @staceyabrams Ok, but let's not get mad of the Dem party doesn't give him top billing again...you're either a team player or you're an Independent.		(Still love Bernie btw.)
@stefdunk @Bravewriting Those things are very closely linked - I'm thinking of "A Modest Proposal" and how slaveowning Confederates got poor Southerners to fight for them - but let's call a spade a spade. Racism is a real thing and "class" is just a confusing term meaning "people who are too powerful."
@ByronKittle @JStein_WaPo @ewarren He's gonna be drinking from small coffee cups for life, huh?
@IBJIYONGI Wow, the "calculated" part of it is new to me. That is probably Jeff Sessions' fingerprints on this.		ICE is also coming for American citizens. I just discovered one man spent 3 years with ICE - surreal, and right-wingers spent Obama years fearing FEMA.		https://t.co/lg4kaSqPr8
@AschConformity_ @IBJIYONGI The banality of evil, precisely.
@ElectBetterUSA @DrJillStein @HowardSchultz John Anderson, founder of @FairVote, seems to have come to the same conclusion after his 1980 Presidential bid.
@mmfa Dr. Northam get help from Republicans? They spent half their time since the story broke chuckling that his Governorship was being "aborted" after a smear campaign claimed he seeks to murder infants. We also now know the the pictures were provided by opposition research.

Yea, Colin's rollout of the protest could have been better. So what? It's 2019, how is this still happening?
@writewhale @juliaioffe Make that "a really big city with a warm water port."
@Frobozky @1a @RTDSchapiro @SashaAnnSimons This is a separate issue than that, simply because of the nature of the Governorship. Your comment reminds me of a Charlottesville marcher who was let go from his job in the wake of a small but focused boycott - business owner didn't like that tactic, neither do I.
@1a @RTDSchapiro @SashaAnnSimons Democrats are fed up with the moral high road only applying to their party - but we can't back down on having the highest standards for those in the Governorship. We can't rest on our laurels.		There are plenty of good Democrats to take the job - it's why people join the party.
@polipi17 @ChrisBWills @joshtpm @RLHeinrichs @axios Presumably this is why @RLHeinrichs refers to a "select few?" Definitely needs to be verified, here.
@JordanUhl To be fair he didn't say "marginal." Maybe he really just wants a 70% flat tax on the Pats, a proposition that would surely be even more popular today after what I'm reading was the worst Bowl in history.
@jpcellini @NekoCase Nobody was complaining about it back then, well, just Justin's manhandling of Janet. But the "protect the children!" line was pure media hype, there was like 1 grandma who called in, bless her.		This is true history btw.

@RamonaRichey @emma_a_whitford @AOC It's called innocent until proven guilty, Ramona!		We don't know what the fellow was accused of, or anything. That is, no doubt, to keep people like ourselves prejudging the victims of this disaster "deserving" of this disaster.
@joefaz Hey guys, the @ADL put out this report. They're legit. You can see their comprehensive report here:	https://t.co/V3Ze3Hhsfj
@paulkrugman If that condition doesn't seem unique to this issue, perhaps another observation will supplement it: Academic leftists and conservatives (and knavish "centrists") dig in with their peer support networks, leading to overinvestment in yesterday's debates.
@paulkrugman I have a theory about what causes this, including: The bias of research funding from the wealthy, "ivory tower" criticism of leftists, and a refusal to see that the job of the academic cannot be isolated from values and agendas, and that the job entails proposing solutions.
@dabeard @AmyEGardner @AriBerman The possibility that this was accidental - because the political leadership at Justice was looking for the wrong thing - is just as scary as the possibility it was purposeful. We need our politicians to serve the public faithfully and demand decisions are backed by facts.
@RawStory I'll admit it right now...the withdrawal symptoms are too severe for me to kick hydroxylic acid

@EdKrassen Conspiracy, a real legal term
@tedlieu @HowardSchultz What Devil May Cry character would @HowardSchultz be?
@JamilSmith FIRST STEP, unless I'm mistaken, wasn't even something on Trump's agenda. It seemed popular so he signed it. He would have been perfectly happy, had the Congress been so inclined, to have said "We had a black President so there are no more problems facing the black community."
@chrislhayes Every. Last. Word!
@politico "Determined" looks like letting the Pentagon (not wholly unjustifiably!) seizing control from the rouge Commander-in-Chief; letting the hawks dismantle his initiatives and restart arms races; and send our troops from Syria straight to Venezuela.
@annagalland @amazon @RalphNortham With Virginia handing out $22K/hire at HQ2 Crystal City for the next 12 years...
@AdamSerwer @BrentNYT Also looks like a decent historical primer on the movement. If you haven't read Ida B Wells' speech "Lynching is color-line murder," I defy you to show me something more important from the time period. These ladies shine.
@Akutagawa2 @PhilipinDC @margbrennan @realDonaldTrump Sad to see the FA dropping some good research potential. As much as we complain about the NFL here in the States, they finally got it together and did some studies.
@ne0liberal I'm proud of everybody pointing out "build wealth" = speculation. Mangling Warren Buffet - if your land isn't a productive asset, you're not investing. You're speculating. It's ridiculous that we should encourage people to buy 1/2 acres to "build wealth" or dissuade city living.
@KAErdmann @ne0liberal My problem with this argument is that we're likely entering a period of slow economic growth, as was the case throughout most history. That puts a limit on the growth potential of the home-as-investment. Still, of the available options, it's one of the best.
@mattyglesias The "Dave" scenario is unfolding!		That, or somebody ought to win a Nobel for this new wonder drug.
@Walrus_Garl @Stop_Trump20 Not just expired soup, expired soup from Wally World!!		I wish I had a picture of the old early '00s soups, jello, and assorted nonperishables left over before my move...had some Barry Goldwater's Salsa xD
@PhilipinDC @margbrennan I hope @realDonaldTrump tells Barron to be careful about doing "headers" with the balls - many soccer players have gotten TBI that way
@stefdunk @never_martha @Bravewriting Which led, incidentally, to the divisive "stab in the back"-like belief amongst some that we could have won the war. Those years also led to congressional inquiries into the CIA like the Democrat-led Church Committee. That, too, has led to a partisan backlash and CIA expansion.
@stefdunk @never_martha @Bravewriting Nixon claimed in the lead-up to the general election that he had a "secret plan." He didn't have anything planned other than expanding the bombing campaign into Cambodia and hoping for a truce. Congress withhold further funds and that's what sealed the fate of the South.
@tedlieu @RalphNortham @RalphNortham could have resigned with some of his dignity intact on the first, or even the second, day of the controversy. The longer this goes on, and the more grasping for relevance the explanations, the worse it gets.
@stefdunk @never_martha @Bravewriting Nixon only was the founding father of dirty tricks, the kind that led to Lee Atwater, Roger Ailes, and Roger Stone, and Donald Trump...didn't have much of a plan for getting out of 'Nam either.
@thedailybeast @jaymichaelson This is a clear-cut free speech issue. It is troubling that so many people who support right-wing policy in Israel trot out the "antisemitic" canard, as if no Israelis protest second-class citizenship for ethnic Arabs or Israeli soldiers haven't cleared out illegal settlements.
@EdKrassen Not returning the kids?! #pizzagate but for real.
@2BGMEDIA @LinzHappyPlace @DanellStutts @jelani9 Kids I knew weren't doing blackface in the '00s but I was aware of a number of things that were basically tone-deaf cultural appropriation - pretty damn close really.		Seems kind of like most ethnic mascots for sports teams for me. I'm big on letting kids know this is bad.
@IlhanMN If you have TEN MILLION DOLLARS, can't you help out your Uncle Sam a lil' bit?		Nothing in here is dragging down your ability to keep making more money - and you have the satisfaction and security of making your country better and stronger by supporting it financially.
@CarlinBob @robreiner It's not in my power to forgive @GovernorVA for the heartbreak this brings our black community. I don't hold him ill will or even see evidence that he's a bad person today - but I believe he should step down as Governor so all the people can trust their Governor.
@bennyjohnson I don't really care, do u		Peak fashionable~
@AstralLobo @Cirincione Honestly, Bolton scares me more than President Trump.
@Cirincione @RealityResists @MalcolmNance This is transparently true, but even then his strategy is not rational. He has been in government long enough that he should know the primary danger of nuclear weapons is accidental use or detonation of a weapon.
@Bravewriting "peak bothsidesism? I'll show you peak bothsidesism"		What are you doin @jack
@george_capen We need to build a wall...concrete gloves for the "penny pinching" GOP whose idea is pinching YOUR pennies!		Absolutely shameful; the only thing I'm optimistic about is that their stumbling rush to enrich the rich is transparent to more and more people as they keep up this con.
@TheRickWilson The weight savings come from his hands, his hair, and what's not inside his noggin
@andreacurry This is what we call a "chunked birdhouse"
@LGJustinFairfax We should all resist calling, like the @washingtonpost's op-ed, for those victimized by racism to be the sole ones to confront it. I don't enjoy calling for @GovernorVA to consider stepping down, but we need to do it for the sake of the party and our State.
@jgreenSTPA Who is this DGJ with all the numbers behind their handle, and why does this barely literate drivel rate a comment?		Is it because they're a Russian spambot?
@JamilSmith It's no longer about what happened 35 years ago. As @JamilSmith says, it's about where the party is going today.		Leaders have to take action and own their mistakes. I understand why @GovernorVA is trying to explain it away, that is not the right path.
@PalmerReport Right-wingers used to call it "virtue signalling" when liberals did it. It's not crossed Don Jr's mind that Dems can ask the Governor to resign without him being a bad person - and Republicans can ignore corruption and all manner of bad behavior.
@davidhogg111 The same staffer that writes President Trump's proof-of-health reports and his tweets, possibly.

@justinjm1 Pics and it did happen, Mr. Governor
@mgranville1 @basednaut @MadeByJohn @SenSanders I take your point, but when I see fact-free outrage manufacture, and lazy argumentative tricks like ad hominems, I think GOP, not Democratic Party.		I'm no Berner, but MLK wrote: "I had also learned that the inseparable twin of racial injustice was economic injustice." 1958.
@rickathy227 @joshtpm For a period, that is literally the way it was, around the turn of the century. Tax information was printed in the newspapers. The reclusive wealthy eventually got their way, though.
@classiclib3ral Waiting for @EWErickson to delete his second poorly-considered Tweet with the to previous tweets appropriately nested, along with some commentary on how it's bad the liberal Twitterverse has to police some well-intentioned conservative 'splainin'.		Twitterception.
@zona_moribunda @melissagira I also don't think Tim means Blackwater in the sense of...Blackwater. Nothing makes me think "shooting dozens of Iraqi civilians for no apparent reason" like them.		Erik Prince is currently on his way to China to help police the concentration camps.	https://t.co/4dmn5tQSNd
@classiclib3ral @EWErickson seems to have missed the part where it is PUBLIC office. It is not the same as getting somebody bounced from a job. The Governor has to represent his party and the people of his state. Although this distracts from that, he should be able to leave content at having won
@RealJamesWoods @Policy And nothing of value was lost.		Chin up, James!
@dm2120 @Inspectah8 @gabrielmalor @yashar I'm getting asthma just imagining how dangerous that Smug Dust would be.
@femalep @MSNBC Roger and Me was a good film - based on a lie. What got my goat was that during the Iraq War, when there were daily outrages from Bush, Moore decided what was important was to keep telling a lie about Vietnam service members, despite being corrected. Sad because he's often right.
@PalmerReport This is a big story. Wikileaks may have coasted by on revealing bad US policies, but the org's been reliably fanatical and indiscriminate; even so, aiming at general US citizens like this is a low point.		But I guess being paranoid in an embassy for 7 years is reason-stripping.
@BeanmealBrandon @charliekirk11 @SoybeanMaster WE FOUND THE SCHULTZ VOTER		WE FOUND HIM		oh, wait, hi, paid for account :S
@cnni Taking the step of warning Stone like this may have been the judge's way of killing the fake outrage over Stone's treatment. Not knowing the judge, perhaps it's her custom, or being done out of deference to the office of the President.		They'd better take the Judge's hint!
@IBMLinux @jilevin Germany had Denazification - and we can see Reconstruction through too. Let's make it happen.
@DrDeb_DVM @MariaTammy @ColMorrisDavis @peacelovesnark @observationpt @RalphNortham @TheDemocrats It's also just as important to mention that I wish @GovernorVA the best, but anybody who does seek higher office has to represent their people and their party - this necessarily includes being able to avoid bringing shame on oneself and that office, even if it is in the past.
@DrDeb_DVM @MariaTammy @ColMorrisDavis @peacelovesnark @observationpt @RalphNortham @TheDemocrats I want to be clear, I do think that these are good questions to be asking. But it is a shame that Virginia political reporting did not bring this to light before, as somebody else mentioned. With America's past we should be talking about these things before election is done.
@DrDeb_DVM @peacelovesnark @observationpt @ColMorrisDavis @RalphNortham @TheDemocrats @GovernorVA I'm not going to be the public acting cop. It's about the office, not the man. What was substantive is that he did not have anything to say about our black community, does not seem to be reaching out for their input, and it seems to me that would be a necessary thing to do.
@KabbieArlish @SamSykesSwears Tbh, that's when you run over them again, until they decide to apologize.		This is gonna be super hard to explain in the context of my @GovernorVA tweets :S
@bova_gus This is sickening.
@DrDeb_DVM @peacelovesnark @observationpt @ColMorrisDavis @RalphNortham @TheDemocrats I've got nothing on this, except to say that MAGA shows the nation hasn't changed as much as we like to think - but nobody is saying @GovernorVA can't be a Dem, just that he is not the right person to represent the party as Gov. I also don't like that he isn't reaching out.
@TaritaC @LittleAngus @MoveOn @RalphNortham @GovernorVA Seems like typical politics to me - always poke the winner of the last election in the eye. They may arrogantly presume that Lt. Governor Fairfax is not strong enough to win election on his own, an assumption I would like to see Fairfax ruining.
@politico @GovernorVA's apology doesn't mention our black community, which I find unacceptable. Whatever the makeup of the voters in the election, @GovernorVA ought to be reaching out to them to create his plans moving forward - and he may learn it is right to resign.
@rickhasen If you lived here in the 1980s you wouldn't have been surprised.
@TaritaC @LittleAngus @MoveOn @RalphNortham Real talk: How progressive is @GovernorVA on whitewashing history, though? Having the right person in the job matters.
@ODoyleRules3 @Pinkomomma @ianrosewrites @debra3gsd @MoveOn If only they knew a black person to pose with them in their photo instead of having to go with blackface, right?
@ODoyleRules3 @Pinkomomma @ianrosewrites @debra3gsd @MoveOn You gotta watch those white sheets, there could be a Klansmas tree hiding inside that makes your impromptu Halloween outfit into an unintentional Klan design.		But really I think we ought to be giving the good Guv more of a warm welcome for portraying a scene of racial solidarity
@LittleAngus @TaritaC @MoveOn @RalphNortham He might take away our sacred Confederate monuments! *awkward shock horror pose*

@jwheels74 Does this guy play pro sports?
@joshtpm He's not even getting the Starbucks Barista constituency, which tells me something about how popular he must've been as CEO

@KatiePhang The investigation is about ready to wrap up any day now
@SenatorDurbin @NAACP There are so many forgotten race riots from before the 1960s. It's also a good reminder that race relations history is more than Confederate monuments.
@KabbieArlish @SamSykesSwears That sounds like the best super power, I don't even think you'd have to apologize.
@petersagal @Deggans Idris should be doing Ultraviolet 2. Let somebody else take on Batman!		Besides, wouldn't Idris be happy not to do a costumed hero flick ever again? (Although he wouldn't have to wear contacts to be Bats, which is no small mercy.)
@aluthercannon @Mark_Buchanan_ @dylanmatt @mattyglesias I'd give you half a point if you were saying Jesus had a brother (there's a reference to Jesus of Nazareth having a brother in the Roman record).		Even in Roman times, and contemporary with Jesus, there were big Jewish rebellions whose leaders we don't even know the names of.
@VinnieTesla @dylanmatt I think the olden phrase is "hoist on their own petard." Even if you're arguing that the Right perverted the phrase from its original, clinical intention of describing PTSD / anxiety, that ship has sailed. Don't really see the harm with turning this cannon back around.
@jbouie At least @elle_em isn't talking smack about IRC

@katierogers @anniekarni Marjorie Merriweather Post would be beyond appalled that her home, which she left to the nation, now is owned by a tasteless scoundrel and tax dodger.		They might share a taste in Russian art, though. (Go visit the @HillwoodMuseum sometime, it's cool.)
@PCMedsAccess @SecAzar @CMSGov @peterbachmd Would love to see a similar chart showing how the MFR price goes into research, testing, and compliance, since we always hear about how that is supposedly the big roadblock for manufacturers (although they manage to sell drugs cheaper in Canada and most other countries).
@morningmoneyben @MSNBC The real #pizzagate!
@LisaPearl @SethAbramson @MSNBC This is President Trump we're talking about - he's always innovating new ways to do things wrong.
@Welmner_Sapfin @borzou @MazMHussain I didn't think the Mongol invasion spread it.  Also worth noting: A recent dig in Sweden found traces of a black death strain left in a mass grave over 5000 years old.		https://t.co/hKaug6ztRf
@borzou I'm just sayin', maybe Tom Clancy gave us the blueprint in Rainbow Six, is all...Is there anything similar for the bubonic plagues?		Current ice core statistical techniques are sophisticated enough that they've been used to corroborate and expand data in the Roman economy.
@SethAbramson I saw him looking blotchy like this on @MSNBC sometime this month. He definitely is a compulsive tanner but I've seen him looking more normal on other channels.		Could be a whole host of issues, but you can rule out color balance or display settings.
@kujakupoet @SethAbramson Yeah, all the *other* people in the picture should look like ghosts, obvs.

@judyinnj @MichaelCBender @PhilipRucker @glubold @mgordonwsj President Trump's democracy by dinner party? Shades of his top-secret meeting at Mar-a-Lago early in his Presidency.
@danieljohnsalt @paulrey99 @yhazony The EU was an ideological project first and foremost (the ECSC). Unfortunately the debate about 'deepening or widening' has only deepened and widened the EU's democratic deficit.		I don't think the UK leaving the EU will address this, or be good for the UK. Nor if they stay.

@politico President Trump just let PM...President Putin scoop all news outlets, and our entire government, on previously secret talks.		With due respect to @SenSchumer we cannot trust President Trump with this knowledge - and he can no longer serve as President.
@StableGeniusLib @TPM It's also worth mentioning that Omarosa watched with disbelief as President Trump talked about "very fine people on both sides" in the wake of the Charlottesville Nazi march and Heather Heyer's murder. We don't hear about how awful Kelly or Mattis were, but they also stressed.

@PalmerReport This vestigal attempt to continue the Bush Administration's courtship of "evangelical" voters is working - for the few lunatics who think Trump is, against the evidence, god-fearing. Alternatively, she might be appealing to the Pastor John Hagee crowd. Batten down the hatches!
@morningmoneyben Plot twist: Tom Brady wants a spot in the spot in the Trump Administration, so, being the clever guy we all know he is, he wrote the chyron himself
@mccallum_brian @TavernWench @gsiskind @jonathanweisman @onlxn @morningmika Those "great" times had frequent race riots and a lynching epidemic. Eleanor pressured Franklin to secure civil rights, but he wouldn't budge, on the theory that he didn't have the votes and needed to spend the political capital elsewhere. Some of it wasted on the Internment.
@mccallum_brian @TavernWench @gsiskind @jonathanweisman @onlxn @morningmika My very middle-class grandpa and his family weren't hot on FDR because they felt he was too tax-friendly and, presumably, for being a demagogue. Given the time period (Mussolini and the rest) it seems logical enough.		Too bad, FDR was a baller and also straight gangster

@politico Getting corruption out of the unions is the first step towards making the public trust them again. Hardly the dismemberment of his organization - they should persevere.		Hardly merits giving a platform to GOP operatives to claim it's the end of the Dems. You got played, Politico.

@RogueEvildoer @ChanduMagician @jimmystagger A commendable mistake!		With all the bad stuff firing off every day, imagine what it would look like if we had decades of Trump and business cronies stuffing every cylinder of the Federal government. No shortage of good ideas, I'm sure Newt Gingrich would be proud af

@pcoyebanjo @RemiAdekoya1 I have an April 1995 newspaper article (by Al Fasoldt) quoting Clifford Stoll: "Stoll finds the idea that computers are tools disturbing. 'A tool for what?

@fawfulfan In a local election meeting before the '16 election I asked a prospective council member why local government couldn't do more for the poor. "You don't want government in welfare, it messes everything up," he said. I wonder why these people are asking to be on the public dole.

@BriefWashington @politico I think you ought to be more careful with American law and English grammar before you use President Washington's name: The judge doesn't defer to the prosecution. I don't know how it is in Russia.
@rusty_pharris @BamasLadyJ @politico Let me check my trusty Gulf Oil road atlas for you. It says there is an ocean between Alaska and Russia. Oh, maybe you mean...you don't have to worry about a left-turn. Just go onto Florida SR1, get onto S Ocean Boulevard, and the servant's entrance to Mar-a-Lago is right there.

@Renate_J_C @1a "A solution looking for the problem" sounds like a better description of the partisan "voter fraud" scare.		If you're going to promote mail-in ballots, you're conceding that some people do have trouble getting to the polls on time. I'd rather have both options available.
@realDonaldTrump US foreign intelligence "passive?" Tell us another whopper, Mr. President!
@judy060709 @AndrewKirell @jason_howerton @CNN Probably by walking.		I'm big on being skeptical, but let's just wait to see what's corroborated / what isn't. The attitude of "I don't want to believe something, so I will post about it on Twitter" makes it hard for people to get to the facts.
@benyc @MarkWarner @MarkWarner if sanctions on Russia are a tool for changing our rivals' behavior, why on Earth did you vote Yes on Senate 1?		It's a dangerous precedent against nonviolent protest rights in Virginia and elsewhere.

@SenatorTester Makes sense. Sovereign nations should probably be dealing on a more direct basis with the Federal government.
@jim_mlvfd @SenatorTester Best wishes on getting that sorted out. Maybe spread the word to the Twitter veterans community? #VetsResistSquadron comes to mind.
@Il_Malandrino @NickNam30053024 @AnandWrites I'm not sure supporting Sen. Sanders' bill would do much right now, since we don't have the votes to get it done. But she definitely should start laying out her view in detail, and soon, if she's going to run for President.
@EclecticRadical @Il_Malandrino @AnandWrites I think it is unhealthy to think that she can't express respect for her ancestors in public, and that says quite a bit about today's identity politics but little about complicated Indigenous people and politics. Some Native people criticized her, but others supported her rights.

@nowthisnews We all carry the trait to panic because it's proven its worth to our ancestors.		I have to consider how I should use my panic: Not to become despondent over the end of the age of easy energy, #hamberders and convenience. The panic is about the race to reinvent ourselves in time.
@george_capen @realDonaldTrump If the President attempts to shortchange these priorities, he may be putting soldiers at risk.

@TrumpSuxBalls @SenBlumenthal @reveal I would love to go all the way to the libertarian extreme here, but the "gamification" of work, the abuse of psychology to create online addiction, and the monetization of fun are corrosive issues in our time.

@SarahLizChar @el72champs This reductive view of the world is crazy, yup.		Carl Sagan's @COSMOSonTV has a quote to help us appreciate ourselves regardless.

@PalmerReport I would not be surprised, at the end of the day, if there isn't an illegal transaction there. My main theory all along has been that @senatemajldr just can't see any political upside to bucking Trump more - and that he puts party over country.		Our votes will be important!
@sepaps @PalmerReport I can't believe how good this GIF is.
@KimonSiri @OleVetUSAF @veterans_i @PalmerReport At this point I have two issues with Bernie: First, he's already lost a primary (which I voted for him in). Second, I love his Twitter feed but he's not been the firebrand against Trump I'd like to see. In 2016, he faded away after conceding. HRC needed more support.
@PalmerReport Minor suggestion for a typo - when you say "no one was surprised ... Stone got popped" you might want to add "except for the legions of Great Pumpkin followers who are convinced they are winning."		I wish you could afford to have a camera crew there like @CNN...borrow @FoxNews'?
@joshtpm @TPM Craziest thing is how groups that supposedly hate each other are nevertheless showing common agenda re: using dirty tricks and getting money. US policy makers beware! Staunch this!		Who loses? Decent people like #jamalkhashoggi, whose memory is being destroyed by lies even now.
@mmfa I'm kinda amazed that @MSNBC's ratio is so lopsided here.		Is there any timing explanation for these figures? I do know that at roughly this time, MSNBC had a lot of coverage of the ongoing investigation into Trump officials (would love to see a relevant chart for that too).
@MaxAbrahms You can go further: We overrate the applicability of our solutions and congratulate ourselves when we vow "never again."		It makes us blind to our reception and values, and makes it impossible to understand the values and motives of "evil" others who do not fit our rubric.
@DenbrotS @mmpadellan @cecerv Never discount the depths of bitterness in the true believer.		But also never discount the patience and deviousness of the anti-democracy activists. They will lie in the weeds like vipers, or landmines, and we can't lose more time on the big issues.
@ActionDonson @mattyglesias This is important, but don't forget a generational breakdown too. We don't want to fall into the trap of allowing older generations to get pitted against younger.

@AOC The "free" part here is a red herring; what matters about Google is that it provides unique services, which can be carelessly destroyed with old-fashioned thinking about monopolies.		'net users who use Google ironically take some individual power back (from old media, etc.).
@AOC Google-type services' monopoly power present a paradox: If we split it up, we shift power away from tech, but at the cost of people literally not having access to free centralized repositories of services - unless we have a comprehensive plan to replace it. Not easy at all.
@mcboneyourwife @FranklinFoer @thedailybeast @HuffPost @BuzzFeed @AOC #CovingtonBoys press fiasco was due to lack of proper journalistic procedure - that's not fixed by starving newsrooms further!		@AOC actually got hammered in early news reports, within days of her election sites were running "fact checks" on her and actually put me off her early.
@mattyglesias "Hi, I'm running for your local elected representative because I believe the government needs to get people off public welfare"		"sounds good, mange"
@ShimonPro @CNN The fact that CNN was the only org with reporters there reveals the sorry state of journalism funding in the US. Many people fully expected this raid based on the timing, and more organizations should have had cameras there.		All props to @CNN's great news team for being there.
@USCPSC is coming BACK! #HandsomeRon forever.		Let's Go!

@AC360 @RickSantorum Funny thing #BoyishRick isn't in there showing us how it's done. Something something man (or woman) in the arena, Teddy says.		Rick's framing makes it seem that the shutdown didn't happen. Well, it DID. That's what people are beating Trump up over.
@GodcallsBS This is the nail in the coffin of the Republican narrative that the House Dems were causing the shutdown. We don't want any more shutdowns!
@emmailey We need to take a step back here. The Russian goal was to spread disaffection with US government and democratic processes more broadly.		Even though Bernie isn't part of the Democratic establishment he has  every right to use his platform. It's ultimately up to us voting.

@EdKrassen @RepAdamSchiff I agree with my fellow Ed's succinct summary of the correct position!		The shutdown amounts to reckless endangerment of the American public and our allies abroad who depend on US cooperation.
@grist Greta is an inspiration to us all, and shames those of us who knew about pollution and climate change decades before she was born.

@JaxAlemany Good on him for sorting out any confusion his backing the resolution condemning his own comments. It created the appearance he might have learned.		Incidentally, the House Dems did not allow the censure to pass for First Amendment concerns.		https://t.co/u4fwHgr532
@gilbmarie @NathanLerner @GOP This happened despite the Koch brothers' influence, because they know their agenda is unpopular and their best bet is to work from the shadows. That is the scary thing about billionaire politics. President Trump may not have many virtues, but he does his bad things in the open.
@NathanLerner He didn't try to build the wall because it wasn't even on his agenda. He let himself get played into putting it there, because Ann Coulter correctly identified President Trump's agenda as self-enrichment at public expense.
@JordanUhl How does Tucker manage that expression without putting any wrinkles in his forehead? There's a product placement in there, I'm sure.

@chrislhayes You can't be as wrong as John Yoo's speculation on CNN's raid coverage, tho.
@FriesFreedom @aliasvaughn Today's news re: the shutdown goes to prove your point precisely.
@PalmerReport Chuck @SenSchumer
@MaxBoot This take doesn't even make sense given that Max Boot is like "nope" to #covingtoncatholic (which I don't agree with, but journalists have to triage more than ever).
@ddale8 @Pete_Rudkins I agree with your analysis, and I think decision paralysis / egocentrism explains a lot of Trump's wall troubles, but many Americans are turning to the ample evidence that the shutdown enables America's adversaries, and the evidence of Trump allies seeking favors, blackmail, et.c
@ddale8 Trump and the wall is a bit like LBJ and the Vietnam War, except where LBJ was worried about the credibility of the United States, Trump is worried about how hard it would be to shut it down again, so he says.		@realDonaldTrump needs to declare victory and move on.
@InglouriousGwen @davydawgg @TheRickWilson Sorry to hear that, I heard a bit about "Fake News!" lately too.		Someday this is going to be a fun read in the history books, if we still have books.

@m_poznansky @DenisonBe @ISQ_Jrnl No library access from a private citizen (sad!) so I have to ask - does the article consider costs when these moves preceded by domestically-oriented bravado, i.e. Pompeo's original statement? And what of the "fool me twice" aspect of even casual bystanders suspecting externals?
@macsimcon @chrislhayes Might even prompt them to pay attention to what they're doing - too many managers are pretty terrible at their jobs.
@rowdyrr9 @chrislhayes This argument is literally "these guys are going to steal us blind, so we'd better let them steal us blind." It's not just the offshore accounts, but debacles like #foxconn Wisconsin, or the Amazon HQ2 deal.		We have to staunch the bleeding sometime.
@PeterSullivan4 There's hundreds of thousands of dollars that aren't going towards making private insurance more efficient than public alternatives.

@Punisher8192 @mazzyberry @davidbleysea @gatesfoundation @BillGates Oh, I'm happy the Gates Foundation uses their money wisely. But I'm not happy that this gives cover to other billionaires to not spend money, and to the ongoing lack of money for pretty much everything else.		For what it's worth, the Africa spending is very good too.
@mkraju Our President raided and leveraged the real estate lexicon in today's presser.		Predictably, his suggestion implies not paying contractors in full. Y'all still ready an' rarin' to build that wall when you don't get paid, guys?
@brutapologist Also other Dem. Senators went further than Sanders according to this report:	https://t.co/pL5F8Q56xe		(Can't find a better / known source now.)
@brutapologist I think a key issue is of democratic norms. In this it seems the Maduro government pushed too hard. It is hopeful that the Venezuelan military is calling for dialogue and renouncing civil war.		Domestic politics poison Sec. Pompeo's 'strong' statement more than any others.

@crampell It is astounding how WaPo can combine hard-hitting journalism with mealy-mouthed nothings like "Ross made waves," as if he would sit in the bleachers at a football game.		If this is an attempt to placate President Trump on style, it's not working.
@samstein It is the low point of looking for low points, agenda in hand.
@substitute Can't see his bomb collar from this angle.
@Trillburne I wish my follows-through-a-follow of Charlie would get silly stuff like this sent to my feed, I'd enjoy him a lot more
@Punisher8192 @mazzyberry @davidbleysea @gatesfoundation @BillGates So after years of the Microsoft tax on computers, after they are entrenched in the market, we are supposed to accept a small amount of philanthropy dictated from wealth? How long will we need to wait for Facebook, Google, and other tech companies to do the same for their towns?
@brutapologist @davidbleysea @gatesfoundation I like your style!		brutalist architecture is underrated, agreed
@OhMyClarence @kdidd0925 @CNN @AOC You mean "taxing the dying middle class?" A huge body of research shows wealth propagates down generations through education spending in families, and new genetic success studies hint at similar strategies. Clearly the issue is quality, not merely dollars spent / testing returns.
@OhMyClarence @kdidd0925 @CNN Subjective quality tests are great, but they will figure more in a post-growth economy, which is more resource constrained. The decision to ignore "crowding out" potential of wealthy and corporations, and ignoring causality &amp; questioning why idle capital is hoarded, seems absurd.
@mabehr @tedlieu @SenMarkey @POTUS Would you agree that a nuclear first strike is tantamount to starting a war? This is beyond even the "police action" rationale that Presidents use for starting wars. As I write elsewhere, Abe Lincoln and the Founders agree that the President should not have that sole authority.
@AnandWrites In the age of Trump, where "philanthropy" is the name given to graft, we're wise to question the motives of even those who advocate good.		Plus, as you've noted elsewhere, philanthropy is not equitable or egalitarian - if you're not on the giving list, you get nothing, no matter.
@OhMyClarence @kdidd0925 @CNN We don't need an "ideal ratio" to see that the current ratio is broken. Even small moves would be preferable to the situation now.		Astonishing that you would ask whether the poor should be poorer - you do understand the criticism and want to engage in good faith, right?
@paulkrugman This is what happens when you elect a person to take care of the nation's business, who proudly (and only sometimes consciously) trumpets their qualifications as the worst boss you could imagine.		How much of a loan does Ross suggest the workers should shoot for?
@mabehr @tedlieu @SenMarkey @POTUS The Founders knew the Executive was not magical:		https://t.co/fCCe7rza7Y
@tedlieu @SenMarkey @POTUS Sensible legislation: Nuclear weapons are too powerful to be solely under the command of one individual (hence Air Force 'buddy system' protocols, and multiple activation keys). The Founders and Lincoln would agree that a first strike amounts to the Executive declaring war.
@petersagal We're beyond Hot Takes on #covingtonCatholic, we're all the way into the spin cycle there.		Besides, "old media" have been infatuated with simple stories like that for ages. I consider the media pushback on coverage a capitulation.
@AdamSerwer @pareene @JoshuaMound @SeanMcElwee That article aged fine, like a whine.		I don't think he was totally wrong; memories of Nader's vote-split were fresh, and even then your average 'netzien' had less access to candidates' history and issues (and the pressure campaigns) than today. I think "scornful" oversells, tho.
@joshtpm Let's be serious. The pictured are above serving in the Administration's alternative facts firefighting squad.		Also right-most skimask guy rolls out like a champ.
@ChadPergram Did you ask @senatemajldr if he was concerned about setting precedent when he denied Merrick Garland a nomination hearing? Or in refusing to allow a vote on the CR?
@stcolumbia Also the War on Drugs.		But yeah the Soviets were involved. Didn't justify going full Jeane Kirkpatrick "the nuns had it coming."
@fmanjoo @AOC er, I mean "Millennials are killing old media," strange slip-up there
@fmanjoo Old media getting salty about Fox News and Twitter getting to decide the media cycle?		It was so much better when it was just 24/7 coverage of "look what that crazy @AOC said today," right?
@cfiesler Honestly surprised that the news media aren't running "look at that crazy AOC, she's anti math" stories yet. (Or have they...I daren't look.)
@maggieNYT "Get your ass to Mahs."
@denise59971619 @FrothyFatCoffee @insomniacx29 @SenFeinstein There's hormones in your meat, in plastic bottles, and antibiotics on pretty much anything plant-based, too! Entire nation unfit!		Plus, many transgender persons never used hormones. Try again.		I'd trust the judgment of our own DoD studies over your nonsense, sorry.
@rowdyh1 @Sassyonemeis @SenFeinstein My excitable friend, you had how many years of "unified" Republican government to pass that change to the draft process? Now you want to dump this responsibility on the Democratic House majority?		I think the emphasis should be on ending wars. Bless our troops!
@FrothyFatCoffee @insomniacx29 @denise59971619 @SenFeinstein You assume all transgender people are "on meds and not stable," of course.		If President Trump wanted to improve military readiness he would end the #trumpshutdown and allow the DEA and Justice to curb opioid production, which hits Trump's base just like everybody else.
@SenFeinstein The politics behind this are simple: We Love The Troops (nevermind sending them off to deadly, purposeless wars like Iraq). So, we can't have transgender persons serving in the military, otherwise it would be hard to disrespect them.		So goes the right-wing thinking on this.
@rowdyh1 @Sassyonemeis @SenFeinstein Ruth Bader Ginsburg brought cases before the S.C. arguing for men, in Frontiero and (especially) Weinberger v. Wiesenfeld. I don't see RBG going to bat for a double standard here. Ask your congressman instead (if you still have one, otherwise you'll have to ask a congressperson).
@jfarlow2nd @oneunderscore__ It seems to me this was true, but I also noticed that the "alt-right" was heavily invested in co-opting the story. That mixed bag of narratives contributed to the perception that GamerGate was "incomprehensible."		In that way it was rather like #occupywallstreet, also divided.
@oneunderscore__ Even though #gamergate is one of the original culture dumpster fires, it still had a grain of truth: Industry posing as consumer advocates (the Entertainment Consumers Association) and the toothless bag of corrupt groupies posing as "games journalists." Not incomprehensible.
@afoxx06 @Smartymarty66 @renee_llewellyn @BernieSyliboy @VinceSchilling Where was all this outrage when a Republican Representative yelled at a Democrat to "go back to Puerto Rico" just last week?
@senatemajldr @POTUS A lie in both claims! The President *Can* sign any legislation should you lay out the case - Will he?		And it certainly is not "the only proposal ... that can ... immediately reopen the government." That is another bald-faced lie.		Thanks for reminding us you're the lynchpin.
@tedlieu @RepTedYoho We need cybersecurity throughout the US much more than we need a border-to-border wall. Long overdue legislation!
@mattyglesias With political prisoners in #catalonia, I'll be watching to see how hard the Spanish government lands on these guys.		The part about MKO is weird, gotta find out what's up there.
@Kooka03 @renee_llewellyn @VinceSchilling I would, yes, but I don't expect them to. They can do whatever they want. Should they meet with him? Yes, even if they think he is going to be preachy.		What happened to "the party of personal responsibility," hmm?
@Kooka03 @renee_llewellyn @VinceSchilling There is a chance for these young students to talk with Mr. Phillips and share any problems they had.		But will they own up to the reports we're hearing about them heckling bystanders?
@Kooka03 @renee_llewellyn @VinceSchilling You're right - he's not a child. At that age I'd been to powwows and knew what a drum was. It's not a gun.		It's not a lot to ask people to respect their elders.
@AnandWrites If only you smiled to power more often, this could be yours!
@Jokuel @DaJoklBua @David14210142 @4cm4k1 @IlhanMN @keithellison I almost have to give you a gold star for that impressive job of trolling.		But no cigar, sorry! (Bad for your health, anyway.)
@mattyglesias I'm saying this without passing judgment on what the kid's motives etc. were. This was a lot different from, say, @IlhanMN's explanation of her "hypnotize" comment where she apologized for giving the appearance of a bias.
@mattyglesias Without being judgmental (though it may be called for), I thought that the two-page letter from the kid facing off with Mr. Phillips was taking a page right from the President. So yeah, I suppose there's "no disagreement," just an attempt from the right to control the narrative.
@DonaldJTrumpJr You know what was the beginning of the end for "those days?"		When lyin' Spiro Agnew gave a speech about the "nattering nabobs of negativism," aka, the Free Press.
@JoshuaParkhurst @shaunking @IlhanMN @bariweiss We're literally in the middle of a thread where Rep. Omar is explaining her mistake. I suppose I can give you this point, but the eyes of the world are watching to see whether the critique of Israel-Palestine policy is going to shift to the actual merits of the policy.
@Fishbones2017 @AnandWrites Damn, that's on point!		Still love Chris Matthews tho.
@DLindewirth @MikevWUSA @MarkWarner @wusa9 Got you talking about it, didn't it?		This is just another way President Trump is damaging the executive branch - if he claims that this Act prejudices the veto power, he is left trying to explain how steel slats needed the entire government to be shut down.
@JoshuaParkhurst @shaunking @IlhanMN @bariweiss It is also instructive that invoking the trope is once again being used to change the subject from oversight of how American tax dollars are being used to support an increasingly nationalist and anti-secular policy in Israel.
@IlhanMN @bariweiss You have my sympathy. Trying to parse what should be a simple issue is worse when others seek to capitalize on it for gain. What is important is that you are learning and you have reflected honestly.		Now, back to what's important - standing with the oppressed people of #gaza
@renee_llewellyn @VinceSchilling You're right though, drums are pretty scary.
@karenamyatt @mattyglesias The incredible spin piece published under his name certainly speaks to our Nation's amazing, best ever, bigly leadership. Doesn't it tho.
@renee_llewellyn @VinceSchilling Was it the kids' right to yell at bystanders?		It would have been nice if somebody understood the meaning of "solidarity." Or if we had some D.C. police to keep protests orderly, or a President who didn't knee-jerk defend his MAGA kids no matter the cost.
@CelesteHeadlee I consciously "reserved" judgement, but would do better to forgo it. I remember what it was like to be wrongly accused by a teacher of wrongdoing - but I also remember that the visuals were bad. At their age I was more intent on learning &amp; sharing, not yelling.
@RepTomReed President Trump is offering to walk back his self-made crisis, but only halfway. That's an "offer?" No Sir, that's not a serious offer to a coequal branch of government. We're here because of the GOP's lackadaisical attitude to governance when in the majority.
@lccoftheisland @YLindaQiu @srl They're afraid of their own shadow if they're afraid of Harris.
@1a @ChampFinLit Ah, there's that old "are millennials killing" chestnut again.		It must've been easier to teach financial lit in the days before credit default swaps and variable APR student loans...
@CelesteHeadlee @1a In the USA, the onus is on teachers and students to learn.		I too went to protest (ironically, "Redskins" mascots) but I spent a lot of my time listening to what the other side had to say. But respect only goes so far; you must also be willing to learn.
@MattZeitlin And also the "Rudy is nuts!" pronouncements we've been hearing for at least a year.		Does time have any meaning, anymore?
@AnandWrites Former leader of Airstrip One certainly didn't deny the charge, did he?
@Bevin802 @SenWhitehouse Somebody left a trail of hamberders to get him there.
@Dpirinku @SenWhitehouse I know - why even take the time to honor Dr. King? It's not like you do good things for any reason other than getting credit, or getting money, or belly rubs or free hamberders.
@renee_llewellyn @VinceSchilling His drumming was not for war, but for a blessing.		You don't need to demonize Mr. Phillips.
@Montanaindy @luxurycovarrubi @Acosta @davidgshortell @SchneiderCNN President Trump's near-daily rants against law enforcement are always self-centered. He's not paying any attention to the old, probably historical, cases of FBI protection of corrupt informants, just like he paid no attention when the FBI warned him against certain NY types.
@moshe2567 @mattyglesias Red-headed Vikings don't want to be mistaken for MAGA hat wearers?
@mattyglesias President George W Bush rarely got in the way of his hawks, or the conservative-evangelical alliance.
@4everNeverTrump When did it become acceptable for schools, or students on a school outing, to all be outfitted with partisan uniforms, anyway?
@ChrisMurphyCT The amount of people in this thread who don't know that the government used to send out guides on everything from "house cleaning tips" to Issue Briefs...		And you can still order reports too.  Also: FOIA terrorism! :3
@MidwesternMama2 @nytimes Seriously, let's draw a line under this - no strings attached! The media framing of this as "both sides" is so pervasive that this obvious truth goes unstated. Trump and Pence are tying themselves in inarticulate knots when asked about this - where is the nose for news?
