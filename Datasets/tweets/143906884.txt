Need to get our economy #BackOnTrack &amp; #NV03 back to work. .@Heck4Nevada more interested in bickering &amp; culture wars. #WrongPriorities
Biggest Difference? .@Heck4Nevada's for #SpecialInterests, #BigOil &amp; wealthiest among us. I'm going to fight for the #MiddleClass. #NV03
Need to balance our budget the right way - with the #RightPriorities: Fairer Tax System, Cut Wasteful Spending, &amp; Grow Our Economy. #NV03
Why won't .@Heck4Nevada be straight about how to balance our budget? Balanced approach. Nevadans want #Results. Not more partisan rhetoric.
I'm the only person in the #NV03 campaign who balanced a budget with a 53% budget hole. Cut spending, but protected #education. #Priorities
Hypocrisy Alert: .@Heck4Nevada attacks my service as firefighter &amp; legislator - ignores his million $$ gov't contract while in #NVLeg #NV03
Proud to have served our community in the #NVLeg &amp; put my life on the line as a firefighter. I commend .@Heck4Nevada for his service. #NV03
I want to thank .@Heck4Nevada for saying he doesn't agree with the negative ads the NRCC is running against me. #NV03
Fact: .@Heck4Nevada voted for weakened #VAWA, rolling back protections for LGBT, Native American &amp; immigrant women. #RecordsMatter #NV03
Every father, son, brother &amp; husband should know .@Heck4Nevada 's record of failing to protect women's health &amp; safety #RecordsMatter #NV03
.@Heck4Nevada wants to use backhanded, backdoor tactics to undermine women's health &amp; safety. I won't stand for it. #RecordsMatter #NV03
.@Heck4Nevada claims votes against process. Sharron Angle said that a lot, too. He just plain voted wrong. #RecordsMatter #NV03
.@Heck4Nevada might be an ER physician, but his voting record on women's health &amp; safety in Congress &amp; #NVLeg has been horrible. #NV03
.@Heck4Nevada voted in July for H.R. 3803 which would criminalize abortions in DC without exceptions for rape/incest #RecordsMatter #NV03
As a husband, father &amp; son of a survivor of domestic violence, women's health &amp; safety is not political. It's personal. #RecordsMatter #NV03
