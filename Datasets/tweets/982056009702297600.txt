No one had the right to try and force any of those kids to move from where they had been standing for up to nearly an hour or more.		It's not like they were blocking a walkway. Phillips could have gone anywhere he wanted that day, but he decided to harass kids.
@JaceFincham @RudolphTheGod @marjorygreen @PubliusPublico3 @FrEdwardBeck Yeah, that didn't happen. There is video footage of Phillips walking right up to the kid as he stood still, and continued to stand still.		You need medication.
@FrEdwardBeck You people are unreal.		Were you literally born yesterday? You act like you have zero life experience.
@marrenefranich @summer0655 @blackmorghann @LynnWoosley @wegotmagic @abvlove874 @KenidraRWoods_ @Alyssa_Milano Oh, ok.		So, if someone stabs the stomach of a lady in her 8th month of pregnancy, and kills the baby, that isn't murder?
@DaveMilone @summer0655 @marrenefranich @blackmorghann @LynnWoosley @wegotmagic @abvlove874 @KenidraRWoods_ @Alyssa_Milano How did you know she's a Trump supporter?
@KenidraRWoods_ @Alyssa_Milano You mean CisBoys/Men, right?		Because if the abortion is for a TransMan, then, you know....it'd be a man...making the decision.
@Sherylarsenaul2 @brucewilson @coochie9ls @missmindylouwho @ReallyRicks @Rosie @AJentleson @OldRussetPotato Correct.
@jnris4real @ProudResister @roflinds Do you people have any information in your heads at all? Serious question, though: Where was your upbringing and what was it like?
@TrumpResister @hovdog @stevevphotos @roflinds Cool story, bro.		What did they do, again? https://t.co/x73gVvOzQG
@hovdog @stevevphotos @roflinds And if they did, they must certainly be MoNsTeRs!!		Only possibility.
@stevevphotos @roflinds Probably not.		Much more likely they were maybe being raucous amongst themselves, she and her friends probably shared a scoff at their MAGA hats, then condescendingly asked how old they were.
@brucewilson @coochie9ls @missmindylouwho @ReallyRicks @Rosie @AJentleson @OldRussetPotato "shouting crude things at young women."		What crude things did they shout?
@rgay @feministabulous Maybe they valued diversity of character over skin color?
@feministabulous @baratunde @MSNBC He gave you consent to touch him like that, right? Heh heh, just asking! 🤗
@CarlosBattousai @Boogie2988 @shoe0nhead It wouldn't backfire if you do it intelligently like a normal person. You're getting feedback from a bunch of Millennials that don't know what they're talking about.
RT @holy_schnitt: remember ladies, you never have to feel bad about guys buying you drinks!! there’s a wage gap they can afford it!!
