@SilentPhotoplay @SkepticNikki Glad to know someone else feels this way.
@Unicorn_Shimmer Her little squeak at the end is the best part. I can‚Äôt believe she‚Äôs all grown up. üò≠
@SkepticNikki Wicca, Buddhism. But I did a lot of research into others.
I had a classmate who bullied me from kindergarten until about 7th grade. When I finally got sick of it and non-violently stood up for myself, we were both called to the principal‚Äôs office and made to apologize to each other and pray together. #ExposeChistianSchools
We were taught that evolution was a liberal conspiracy to draw people away from god. Girls were to dress modestly so as not to cause our ‚Äúbrothers‚Äù to stumble. Slavery was good for the slaves because it exposed them to Christianity.
This hashtag is so real. I went to an ACE school from K-12. We were taught that the only ‚Äúgood‚Äù people were white, conservative, and evangelical Christian. Catholics were a cult. Black people were black as a result of Cain murdering Abel, if I remember correctly.
@Unicorn_Shimmer Nice beard.
@Unicorn_Shimmer Well, shit. I‚Äôm torn.
@RandyRainbow Oops. I think someone doesn‚Äôt know the definition of the word ‚Äúliterally‚Äù.

@KateKnibbs @caseyjohnston I had mine done at PP. One of the techs on staff happened to be a doula. She asked if I wanted a hand holder, I declined. As soon as she heard me scream, she came back in the room and I accepted. I didn‚Äôt hear a damn thing she said to me, but it was nice to have the support.
I just found out I‚Äôm a cat. I‚Äôm not sure what to do with this discovery. https://t.co/JuSJEhlMUb

RT @solomongeorgio: Today is a reminder that if homosexuality was a choice, there would be 2, maybe 3, straight women left after today.

@SkepticNikki No wonder they were abandoned.
@Unicorn_Shimmer Oh, holy shit. Boooooooooo
@DanielleMuscato First thought: I wouldn‚Äôt trust that they were abiding by the curfew and I‚Äôd still behave exactly the same. Second thought: get off work after dark and walk to my car alone, without obsessively looking around for potential threats.

@AtheistExpShow That and seeing ‚Äúdemons‚Äù at night. I just recently found out that I was experiencing sleep paralysis.
@AtheistExpShow The terror I experienced from being told I was bad. I was convinced I‚Äôd be left behind when the rapture happened. I remember being around 10 years old, waking up to an empty house, then frantically searching for my grandparents who had just gone to the store.
@SkepticNikki Styrofoam, high pitched shrieking, the sound of one of my dogs vomiting, alarm clocks, my neighbor‚Äôs subwoofer booming at all hours.
@Unicorn_Shimmer you have cat twitter connections.
https://t.co/KA0LEQVD5y just want to get her out there, in case anyone wants to help out.
