RT @USUN: We have heard this same song from Russia many times before. Lying, cheating, and rogue behavior have become the new norm of the Russian culture. Russia needs to join the rest of the international community and support Security Council sanctions on North Korea. https://t.co/ZKXUFFC1Cf
RT@USUN:“The final, fully verified denuclearization of N.Korea is the int’l community’s over-riding objective. The evidence no longer allows us to take Russia’s word that it shares this objective. Russia must now demonstrate by its deeds that it shares our objectives in N.Korea.”
RT @USUN: “Russia has engaged in a concerted campaign in the Security Council to cover up violations of sanctions, whether they’re committed by Russians or citizens of other states. The United States has evidence of consistent and wide-ranging Russian violations.”
RT @USUN: “The difficult, sensitive talks with North Korea are ongoing. The Trump-Kim summit has set us on the path toward complete denuclearization.  But we are not there yet. And until we get there, we must not ease the powerful worldwide sanctions that are in place.”
Any cheating on sanctions is offensive to the international community who want denuclearization of North Korea. We will confront this head on this morning at 10:00 am in the Security Council. https://t.co/w6xR4zkfmK

RT @USUN: Peacekeepers have one of the UN’s hardest jobs — protecting the world’s most vulnerable people in conflict. Their good work is overshadowed when some abuse their power. The U.S. has introduced a resolution to improve performance and hold abusers accountable.🇺🇸 https://t.co/IhyVKtW7o2
RT @USUN: “Peacekeeping is based on trust b/w the protected and the protectors. We, the Security Council, give them this power.  We are responsible for what they do with it – not just for the sake of the victims, but for the sake of the mission, the UN &amp; peacekeeping itself.”
RT @USUN: “We ask our peacekeepers to go into dangerous situations and put themselves in between warring parties. We ask them to be brave and impartial and, above all, to protect some of the most vulnerable people in the world. We ask this all in the name of peace.”

RT @USUN Today we held a meeting on Venezuela — a case study in gov’t corruption. Once a wealthy country, today the Maduro regime steals food from its people, deprives them of medical supplies &amp; profits off their misfortune. We won’t stop getting loud for the people of Venezuela https://t.co/7DfssKluTM
RT @USUN: “Corruption isn’t just something for us to dismiss as someone else’s problem. It’s at the heart of protests that are affecting international peace and security. Venezuela is a wake-up call. We urge all of our colleagues, on the Security Council and off, to heed it.”
RT @USUN: “Hugo Chavez’s perverse vision of a socialist paradise in Venezuela has transformed into a criminal narco-state that is robbing the Venezuelan people blind.”
RT @USUN: “Something is very wrong when citizens of an oil rich country have to leave in order to beg on Colombian streets to feed their children. That something is the corruption of the Maduro regime. This is a man-made crisis. Period.”
RT @USUN: “The fact is, corrupt regimes cannot be ignored, wished away, dealt with quietly or with whispers. If the Security Council is going to deliver on its commitment to peace and security, corruption must be addressed.” https://t.co/pR4fLLtuzq
RT @USUN: "Governments in places like Venezuela and Iran don’t exist to serve their people and happen to do a little corruption on the side. They exist to serve their own interests and corruption is the means by which they do so."
RT @USUN: “9 of 10 countries that Transparency International considers the most corrupt in the world are on the Security Council’s agenda. But instead of reflecting on why this is the case, the United Nations is too often willing to ignore corruption.”
RT @USUN: Thank you to Secretary General @antonioguterres for taking the time to help us shine a light on the link between corruption and international peace and security. https://t.co/e0I3alGRVZ
RT @USUN: Thank you to the @EnoughProject’s John Prendergast for briefing the Security Council today. “In order for peace to have any chance, those benefiting from the human misery wrought by conflicts around the world need to pay a price, whether financial, legal, or political.” https://t.co/5vjdoIvzsP
RT @USUN “Corruption spurs revolutions, enables extremist groups &amp; fuels civil wars. Combating corruption isn’t just about good governance, it's about maintaining peace &amp; security. The United States is determined to shine a spotlight on these connections.” https://t.co/wExwAzV6nE

@The_Black_Camel @_terminatorj Have you ever asked why? Don’t assume people are bad. Our world is better than that. Judging people without knowing the situation or facts is a disservice. I wish all good things for you.
@randaaimour Nikki is my name on my birth certificate. I married a Haley. I was born Nimarata Nikki Randhawa and married Michael Haley.
@randaaimour Yes, raised Sikh by my parents and very proud of it.
@SaifElBirawi Yes, and proud of it.
@The_Black_Camel @_terminatorj I’m not white. I’m Indian American. Don’t ever judge or assume. Many people are looking for peace just like you.
@The_Black_Camel @_terminatorj It’s a shame you think that. I am very open minded and thoughtful in everything I do. You may not agree with me but to think I’m one side is inaccurate. I hope to meet you at some point.
