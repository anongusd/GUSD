@Lons As many times as I've seen it, I recalled THAT as the end. It wasn't until your tweet that I remembered that it wasn't. Wonder if it was Payne's call or studio's.

After Olivia Colman's much deserved Best Actress #Oscarswin, all bets off have to be off for Best Picture. Which, of course, means Roma will win after all, right?
Holy crap.
I don't think Yorgos will win #Oscars Best Director for The Favourite (like many, my second pick of this year's nominees), but the strange sudden odds drop should remind gamblers of the huge risk of betting on outcomes already known by some. Looking at you #GameofThrones bettors. https://t.co/gtMl9g1JZQ
@NathanWurtzel True. My soon to be 52 year old brother still holds grudge that he wasn't allowed to come up from the shore to go.
@NathanWurtzel Meh. I was there at JFK (and in a great viewing spot), yet nearly all my best Live Aid memories are from the Wembley side.
Am I the first (or at least in the top 10,000) to call for a Melissa McCarthy and Brian Tyree Henry hosted #Oscars ??

This is a fantastic tweet thread both (cheekily) distancing the social media team from their food critic's controversial view on In-N-Out french fries, and also creating a bit of fun as well as days long reader engagement from the kerfuffle. Well done, @latimes. https://t.co/rzZJvCa36r
Great to hear. I genuinely don’t know how these Justices and lower court judges do it, working well into their late 80s. I hope I have just some of the strength and mental acuity they have to perform at such a high level at that age. https://t.co/UTlZ47T1IB

@mikeyavo It's very good in all facets. Has been our go to since it opened, even though WF is closer and an easier walk. TJ's has pretty much fallen off our radar too because of Sprouts.
@mikeyavo I rarely get sticker shock from prices (have lived in WeHo too long for that), but have been genuinely surprised at some Whole Foods prices that are nearly double what one would pay at Sprouts. And the latter store doesn't have an infamous parking lot situation either!
This has been fairly apparent to anyone who has shopped at Whole Foods recently; the much touted Amazon discounts have largely vanished and the market chain's prices have again surged past natural grocery competitors like Sprouts &amp; Trader Joe's. https://t.co/8Dy3wbtvUV

Barely a month ago, oddsmakers put the Pats at 8-1 to win the #SuperBowl. Now, after yet another historic Tom Brady performance to beat the Chiefs in the #AFCChampionship, that bet’s just 2 weeks away from paying off. Incredible.

So, how do Dodgers fans think Joe Girardi will do when he replaces Dave Roberts as manager next year?
@Lileks Just read about this Tommy parody in Eric Idle’s new book. He gave Lorne Michaels this and The Rutles short for use when he hosted SNL. Michaels chose Rutles and a new chapter in Idle’s career was born.
@baseballcrank You are correct. As of the Brooklyn-Boston 1916 World Series, the Dodgers nickname was known widely enough that the @nytimes referred to the team by that name (and not Robins) in this early September baseball roundup: https://t.co/oe2R4G1ifQ

@MikeTanier Yes, and as a buyer, the app send you a push notice on your mobile when the purchase goes through. What's the confusion?
Trey Burton will always have love from Eagles fans for throwing the Philly Special TD alone. Even in Bears uni.
@RBPundit No he did not. Jogged off field after injury, went straight into locker and has yet to return 9 months later. Rodgers would definitely be taking huge risk if he returns though. See Falcons Keanu Neal on Thursday.
Mark Davis and Jon Gruden just might have destroyed my 40+year fandom of the Raiders (even predating my love of my hometown Eagles). No way Mr. Davis would have committed $100 million to Gruden just to watch him give away Khalil Mack for scraps. Ts &amp; Ps to Derek Carr.
Evergreen tweet: Not even noon PDT in Week 1 of NFL season, but Tom Brady and the Pats have already clinched their division and annual first round bye in playoffs. Patriots might lock up 1 seed by end of game.

@tpilla Boo's is great (best in LA IMO), but I can't judge it on cheesesteaks since I'm a plain wit' guy. But Mikey seems to like them a lot. You'll just have to make the trip.
@RalphGarman I love Boo's since it's the best plain wit' I've found in 30 years out here, but since I don't eat cheesesteaks that finishing method kinda baffles me. Have never seen that anywhere in Philly, and we visit home every year.
@RealGlenMacnow Loved your baseball on Facebook rant. That would have annoyed the hell out of me too had I been watching. TV rec: HBO's Succession. Slow burn, but gets crazier &amp; crueller w each ep. Excellent cast too. Highly recommended.

@RealGlenMacnow Hi Glen, traveling in Italy this week and was hoping to listen to your pods with Ray as we hopped around. However none are showing. No shows this weekend? Or might they be restricted outside US (other WIP content is not)? Thanks.
That not only the Lakers, but the Celtics also got snubbed by Boogie, makes this move even sweeter. All the Sixers have done is resign JJ Redick, but this has been the most fun day of NBA free agency. I’m loving it. https://t.co/ozyz9vDnXX
@OddsShark Thanks. Surprising. Assumes that includes stoppage time as well, e.g., see Belgium today in 94th minute against Japan.
@OddsShark What’s a draw mean in knock out games? Level after extra time? Before PKs start?
Great read: The @ringer's @ShakerSamman beautifully encapsulates #Belgium's amazing stoppage time run against Japan, including Lukaku's dazzling performance without ever touching the ball, to produce the most glorious goal of this #WorldCup  https://t.co/2fgUdoaEoF
@dmay706 @SixersLegion As much as I enjoyed last season, especially after the ASG, I think we have to admit that the win total was a bit inflated by the league wide tankathon. Still think a 48 win season would be a success for me this year.
@instapundit @SalenaZito I have stopped following interesting accounts I discover, but instead add them to one of my vertical lists: Politics, Tech, Los Angeles (good for emergencies), NBA, NFL and Soccer. Much better way to read what I want on Twitter.
Wow. What a comeback! Just adjusted DVR for extra time when Belgium started its miracle game winning run. Even My Darling Love called to say she felt like she was having heart attack. Hope Beljica got this out of their system and start playing before the 69th minute. #BELJPN

@RealGlenMacnow Glen, I'm Philly native who's lived in LA nearly 30 years and Lakers fans have to be on that list, maybe at top. Celtics fans too. Also, since 2004, Red Sox fans left Yanks in dust in level of obnoxiousness. Great show, btw. Your pods with Ray are a big part of my weekends.
@Michael_Levin Don't forget that 2021 draft is the year Dave Silver says NBA is targeting to open to high schoolers again. Could be loaded draft.

@ericjackson Total misread by me. But judging by my NBA Twitter list, there will be lots among the hardcore, 5 games a night on League Pass set, watching unhappily and very grudgingly. As a non-NBA writer &amp; Sixers fan, I'm willing to move on now. GSW in 5 and hopefully, LBJ stays healthy.
Imagine Sixers sadly would lose Dario Saric in that scenario, but will trade it for a Las Vegas franchise. Then move New Orleans to East to balance conferences. https://t.co/xAmJwy0BTA
@ericjackson I sense some sarcasm in that tweet. This hardcore 45 year long NBA fan is feeling a bit weary after long season. Thinking Killing Eve, Evil Genius, Westworld DVR backlog, and bunch of other TV catch up next couple weeks until World Cup starts.

@SpikeEskin No worries. All on me. I need better sarcasm font. Glad you got your Boston wish. Look forward to new pods after each win.
@SpikeEskin In all seriousness, I feel for you. I can barely stay awake for west coast games out here any more. And trying to watch a post 11pm fight when I was last in Philly at my Dad’s killed me. Don’t know how east coast people can do it.
@SpikeEskin Really? That Mike Levin guy who’s a TV writer on several LA based shows and frequently mentions LA locales where he hangs with LA based friends (mostly Ringer cult members, btw) actually lives here? Listener since 2014. Amazed I never picked up on that.
@SpikeEskin It’s a damn shame that you know no one who lives and works on LA time. 3pm is a killer for us working folk out here. At least you’re co-host of the only Sixers podcast.
@marcthiessen @NYRangers It was Sean Couturier not Giroud who played the last game of the series with a torn MCL (not ACL). Agree with your larger point though.

@robertmays Thoroughly enjoyed reading your tight end piece (and really hoping Gesicki is still there for the Birds at 32). One small nit: Super Bowl win is Eagles 4th NFL title, though first of SB era. Others were in 48, 49 &amp; 60. Philly fans count these 😉

@boobie_styles No worries. I was sitting on first 5 S2 eps and binged Saturday when Sixers were off and most other games ended early. Then listened to recaps in reverse order. Brian Tyree Henry eps are always my favorites. Barbershop was funniest ep since B.A.N.
@boobie_styles Doing this because you're a fellow process truster: https://t.co/KmniH7h8Oo #TTP
@alexia They've also popped up all over WeHo and Beverly Hills in the last couple weeks. Odd thing is I've seen absolutely no promotion of them aside from what's on the scooters themselves.
Fascinating read from the past: In 1999, @David_Gerrold successfully predicted our mobile computing future and also foresaw the privacy challenges it has wrought. https://t.co/aViBSWV9D0
Just stumbled on Sideways on HBO. Brings back so many memories of Santa Ynez &amp; Santa Maria Valley trips. Plus Chuck Rhoades as a loser oenophile looks very strange in retrospect, and really, you could still smoke in CA bars in 2003? No wonder my lungs are a disaster.
@joey_squad @OldTakesExposed I don't think he was wrong though. Fultz was always on the roster. NBA doesn't have a DL or IR like other sports providing roster flexibility. Just an injury hardship exception that teams can use to petition NBA to add player (Think Celtics/Hayward).
And on a nationally televised game vs the Nuggets too. Can't wait to see how the youngest Sixer looks. Would be wonderful to have even more shooting and spacing heading into the playoffs. https://t.co/E0mC7no3dt
Hadn't checked Twitter for hours, but now see the short lived mobile pizza delivery startup, #SliceLine at the top of US trends. Great promotion by HBO for Silicon Valley. Hope drone pizza delivery is available in LA.
TrailBlazers have swept season vs Thunder 4-0. And now, OKC is just a half game from falling to 6 seed and a 1st round matchup vs none other than Portland. Lots of NBA drama to unfold next 2 weeks.
I typically don't watch 60 Minutes, especially when Billions, Silicon Valley are back and Barry is premiering, but learned from NBA Twitter of Giannis Antetokounmpo profile. So now it's in the DVR queue. It still will have to wait until after Axe and Chuck of course.
@SpikeEskin @RTRSPodcast Already digested @RTRSPodcast as I walked pup and cooked Philly style breakfast complete with scrapple (not an easy find in LA). Now listening to Didinger-Macnow pod. Hope I live long enough to hear you and Mike age into them.
After watching Qualifying and now pre-race, I still miss NBC but do like Sky Sports coverage. Reminds me of watching races when in Europe or Asia. Still baffled why ESPN bought it with no production investment. Reminds me of early 80s ESPN when they had no idea. Very strange. https://t.co/ApUw5OXOYw
@richarddeitsch Thank you Richard.
Wow. This is no longer just an @ESPN @F1 issue. Now a $DIS problem (yeah, I know I spent $ on Black Panther too), but @ESPNF1 is alienating an older, affluent audience that's resisted cord cutting. Until now. Disastrous night. Where TF is the #AusGP? @richarddeitsch you awake?
@duffey_bryan @IsaacLHarris Yes, but I think 4 and 5 are impossible now based on how far ahead Lakers are of teams in that range (LA can't accrue enough losses through remaining schedule to come close to them) and can only jump into top 3.
@IsaacLHarris I'm a Sixers fan, but best case now for that pick is 10, unless it somehow lands in the top 3. In that case it's Philly's if it's 1, and the nightmare scenario, Boston's if it's 2-3.
I met Timmy when he first got to La Salle as I was graduating. Followed his career ever since. I would miss his NBA analysis on ESPN, but he would be a tremendous hire for the Explorers! https://t.co/WCNEsu7dx4
Started watching Spurs-Jazz with 4:00+ left in 4th and between Donovan Mitchell possibly clinching ROY, Rudy Gobert, LaMarcus Aldridge (45 points!) Patty Mills &amp; Manu, this might be best game of the NBA regular season. Incredible playoff atmosphere in San Antonio. #ILoveThisGame

@adnanESPN Love your film takes/pods &amp; listening to your Russillo pod now, but am out on Three BBs. Finally saw few weeks back &amp; thought it was disaster as movie. Could’ve been classic 6hr series on Netflix/HBO. Needed a writers room to explore threads &amp; nuance characters a bit.
This @mattyglesias post is getting renewed attention due to United/Delta actions on NRA, but I don't care; it's a great idea: Let foreign air carriers compete and fly domestic US routes. Air travelers would benefit from new competition. H/T @instapundit https://t.co/etWS0DJ0tY
@Michael_Levin And I am going to be super annoying to My Darling Love by refreshing my phone every 15 seconds for @sixers-Wiz updates at our annual @LucquesLA Cassoulet night dinner tonight. Hopefully, she'll be too distracted by her favorite meal of the year to notice.
@DerekBodnerNBA How much do you think @sixers will have to give up this Summer to trade Bayless's final contract year? More than a couple of high seconds? Player?
This is a fantastic read chronicling then-Cassius Clay's recording of a comedy album trolling the feared champ, Sonny Liston, in the months before his legendary triumph on this date in 1964. #iamthegreatest https://t.co/oKB771vRy5
@KeithSmithNBA Not more fun for @sixers fans. Big back to back @ Wiz tomorrow night. Needed starters, esp. JoJo, to rest most of that 4th. 2nd unit's a scary thrill ride though.
Even if they made a mess of the contract (and DR's tweet suggests they did), that's a large enough amount for U of A Trustees to consider litigating, especially if Miller needs to defend an expensive criminal felony charge (no opinion yet if that's in offing for Feds.) #Leverage https://t.co/HrBcIzrDoI
Reminder to @sixers/NBA fans: Disgraced ex-agent Andy Miller repped Nerlens Noel and refused to let 76ers see Kristaps Porzingis’s medical records or workout. Sam Hinkie then chose Okafor over KP in 2015 draft, perhaps the process’s biggest what if. #ttp https://t.co/wyywvS47wr
@CarmichaelDave Last weekend was crazy. It was on par with Oscars weekend in my WeHo neighborhood. Parties and traffic everywhere. One difference from Oscar: Throngs of people who had no chance of attending, wandering aimlessly on La Cienega, Santa Monica and Melrose.

Captain Andrew Luck's tweet takes just a bit out of the sting at losing a second key member of Doug Pederson's offensive brain trust in less than 3 days. Now the Eagles need to do all to keep Coach Duce. Finally, Colts ultimately were lucky that Josh McDaniel reneged on them. https://t.co/J3lo8Daws4
Remember when national media went crazy ridiculing Vegas placing the Sixers win total as over between 41-44 wins last summer? I do. I was a strong under too. Yet 76ers could win 17 out of remaining 29 games vs many now tanking teams &amp; still hit 45 on the season. Incredible jump. https://t.co/CxkmpJuhLQ

LAPD immediately claimed that they had shot an armed teen when he pointed a weapon at them; then could not produce any weapon. I have no idea why Los Angeles media is not giving this more play.

Biggest question for me today is can Sixers dump year 3 of Bayless for one of those seconds or can BC get more creative with a return. Also, can this be an off season move? @DerekBodnerNBA https://t.co/cvBdVWsVYe
My thought exactly. But LeBron just decided to be LeBron down the stretch. What an amazing bounce back OT win for the Cavs. NBA is just incredible drama night after night. https://t.co/9tbo0MPOVh
Damn. Hate hearing the Kristaps Porzingis news. As a @sixers Process Truster, I've been through through these wars. No love love lost for the Knicks, but NBA is definitely better when the MSG team is good. Best to KP on a quick and full recovery.
I get the Hollywood Reporter,  because they keep sending it to me (thanks guys! I enjoy getting it), but haven't bought a physical mag or newspaper that was not for a long non-wifi airplane ride in two decades. Might make an exception here. #FlyEaglesFly #SuperBowlChampions https://t.co/2TEQKptZGy

Can’t believe this terrible tragedy occurred 15 years ago today. I listened in horror to NPR on an FM enabled Walkman on flight from SFO to LAX as it happened.

Terrible to hear the very tragic news that Rasual Butler and his wife, Leah, were killed in a car wreck this morning in Studio City. A true Philly guy, he was the last LaSalle Explorer (my undergrad) to play in the NBA. Condolences to their family and friends.
@Cornelia_36 Nope. Just checked last year's reporting and all noted that he passed too late to be included, though one act mentioned him in a non-televised segment. No such excuse this year. Very odd.
Did I blink and miss Grammy Pop-Jazz-R&amp;B nominee pioneer, Al Jarreau in #GRAMMYs In Memoriam segment? 33 years ago today he was among the select few recording We Are The World with Quincy, Michael, Lionel &amp; many more. How does that oversight happen? #GrammyAwards
@WhitlockJason Oh, I am not saying they don't. But any of those working on their clients' behalf should be completely transparent with them about their strategies, especially if employing risky, black-hat ones that could embarrass clients or damage their brands if exposed.

@tpilla Also, go to bed!
@tpilla Only Ws matter now.
@tpilla Super young team that's very short handed when veterans and shooters are out. Redick, Bayless out. No Fultz still. Subpar Embiid, Simmons, game. Bad loss though. Grizz are easily beatable this year. DVR'd, but not sure how much I'll watch this one.

@tpilla @Eagles @sixers Was working and didn't turn it on. Might watch first half (the good half) later. But, I expected a loss and got a loss. They're a .500 team w/ no bench depth due to trades &amp; injuries. Decent season so far in my view.
@tpilla @Eagles It's possible. Would it be the peanut's first game?

It took nearly a full two months, but the NBA playoffs have finally produced an incredible game. #Classic #NBAFinals
That arguably was the best quarter of basketball the Cavs have played in this #NBAFinals yet Dubs still lead Game 3 by 8 after 1. Bad omen.

Mandžukić's equalizer was so amazing that it feels that Juventus has more than just tied Madrid. Ramos yellow card could be big factor too.

As @Sixers keep working to win, #LakersAlert that they can only fail to lose 1-2 more games to lock their tank draft lottery position. https://t.co/L7EhItyUR6
Best thing about this Suns-Lakers game is that it's the 1st game since ASG that @MagicJohnson &amp; Jeanie Buss allow LA to try to win! #tank
@AndrewBrandt I assume Warmack effectively betting on himself &amp; familiarity via his Bama (now Eagles) O-Line coach helped get the deal thru.
@Sixers If it's any consolation, this is what you have to look forward to this weekend. https://t.co/HGhsusPLG2

Spurs-Rockets jumped from amazing to insane! Playoff level intensity, especially by Kawhi Leonard. Either will be very tough out for GSW.
@KeithSmithNBA Great info. Thanks.
@KeithSmithNBA Wouldn't anyone they sign now not be eligible for Playoffs? Thought that deadline was 3/1.
@Ron_LaPierre LA tanking is right idea, but Buss/Walton preening that Lakers don't tank when it's obvious after Deng/Lou moves annoys me.
Very sorry to hear of Robert Osborne passing. Loved him as TCM host for years. He will be greatly missed. #tcmparty https://t.co/fdLsgL6Fc5

@JakePavorsky Yeah, was very worried that Jazz just didn't have it today. Reminded of pre-Cousins trade upset over Warriors few weeks back.
Utah did everything they could to give that game to Kings. Bizarre game deserved bizarre overtime finish. Another Sacto loss good for 76ers. https://t.co/IKF9BmBpwa

Even w Aaron Rodgers, if this goes to overtime, I can't see a beaten up Packers team winning. Cowboys rolling lately. Want 2B wrong #GBvsDAL
If Aaron Rodgers and the Packers keep this up, the last football came in Atlanta's Georgia Dome could be for the NFC Championship. #GBvsDAL
That Rodney Hood knee hyperextension looked very scary. Hope he's ok. Utah's had a very nice season and Jazz cannot afford to lose him.

@DDsD Also, when did trends stop being based on absolute # of mentions of topics in relevant geographic areas? Makes no sense to black box.
@DDsD It's apparently contextually relevant to be top trend worldwide but not in US? Most I follow or who follow me are US based.
@Rikvidr #RoseBowl still top worldwide trend, but missing in US. Also it's a football game, not a parade. That would be the #roseparade.
#RoseBowl with Penn State &amp; USC trading blows is amazing drama, but Giannis vs. Westbrook in Bucks-Thunder has been just as compelling.

Doc Rivers just melt down &amp; got tossed. But Nets miss both Technicals &amp; 1 personal to give Clippers 2nd chance in OT. Oh, Brooklyn.

Donald Trump said he'd tax hedge fund managers' carried interest pay at ordinary income rate, not capital gains. Will GOP follow through?

Usually Warriors win by outshooting teams. If they win tonight their rebounding on both ends of court will have been big factor. #NBAFinals

@Ohdoctah Dumbest prosecutorial gambit of my lifetime. Have him try on glove that had shrunk from moisture while OJ's hand got swollen 1/2
Lost so much respect for Barry Scheck (Mr. Innocence Project!), Carl Douglas and even a longtime litigation hero of mine, Johnnie Cochran.
ESPN OJ doc is amazing. Finally convinced me how much Simpson was a sociopathic murderer. Already know LA juries are easily manipulated.
Great sports night. US makes 1st #CopaAmerica semi in 21yrs &amp; LeBron &amp; Cavs force Curry &amp; GSW to a Game 7. 2 amazing games coming. #USAvECU

@Popehat I think that's bc many abhor G not for what they write, but for their publishing of private info (&amp; not just Hogan's/Thiel's).
LeBron has 20 points. Klay Thompson has 26! And Warriors have made 11 3s. And there's still 1:31 left in 1st half!
Oh that LeBron (actually Shumpert's fault) back court violation's gonna make a vine that nearly sums up this series. #GSWvCLE

Watching Dubs vs Blazers OT: I'm like Vin Scully in 88: "I don't believe what I just saw." Steph Curry says "I'm back!"
Raptors woes: No Jonas Valanciunas; Kyle Lowry fouls out. I'll be shocked if Miami Heat don't win this easily in OT.
Wanted to kill Dwyane Wade for the calls he gets, but again he just gets to hoop like few players in NBA history. Sends Raptors-Heat to OT.

@Ohdoctah Believe in the build, Owen. Just 3 years ago, GSW fans booed owner off court AFTER he got Steph, Klay &amp; Bogut on team. @Sixers
Last few minutes of Cavs-Warriors have proven to me that @Sixers are just 2 years from NBA elite status. #lowbar #NBAFinals

Lightning tie Chicago at 1-1. Looks like Blackhawks in 6. NHL Stanley Cup Final might again end after NBA Finals. That never used to happen.
By not immediately taking out pup as directed My Darling Love's text, I did not miss 2 very quick goals by Blackhawks &amp; Lightning.
@Bencjacobs @seanmdav Does this have something to do with the Duggars? Because I've been hearing a lot about them lately.
Boy, those Chicago fans sure get loud when Blackhawks score. Too bad for Lightning that this game's being played in Tampa.

I hope James Kirkland's ok. Ref should have stopped on 2nd knockdown. Brutal shots by Canelo before the KO. #CaneloKirkland
Golden State putting up bigger fight than Kirkland at this point. Grizz lead down to 6(!) while Canelo's in control. #CaneloKirkland
Kirkland literally save by 1st round bell. Switching back to Grizz but will be back for Canelo's possible 2nd round KO. #CaneloKirkland

CJ McCollum's having career night, but he's nothing compared to Steph/Klay if Grizz don't have Conley. GSW will destroy Memphis back court.
It's midnight on East Coast, so already seeing Philly tweets proclaiming Happy Marcus Mariota Day. Nothing like Eagles draft day!
Almost want Memphis to lose this to Portland if it means Mike Conley gets more recovery time for Warriors series. Alas, Grizz need to close.

Yes, I just switched from Kentucky-Wisconsin to last 10 secs of mostly meaningless @Sixers-Hornets game. Reminder: NBA always &gt; #FinalFour
@DerekBodnerNBA Been a terrible drought for us Duke alums/fans last 5 years. Being from Philly only way I've been able to survive it.
Wisconsin hasn't looked like it belongs on same court as Kentucky most of half; how they're up 4 at the under 12 is astonishing. #FinalFour
Proud Duke alum tonight. Amazing effort by freshmen, upperclassmen alike. Love watching Jones, Okafor &amp; Winslow. NBA futures are bright.
Even up 15, Duke needed that under 12 minute TV timeout more than Michigan State. Foul troubled 8-man rotation looks tired. #FinalFour
Fully agree. Risky. MT @SethDavisHoops Duke would be better off trailing at half than having Winslow pick up his 3rd these last 5 minutes.
