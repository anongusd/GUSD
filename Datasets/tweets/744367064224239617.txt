@PGAntioch @SethAbramson P.S. If there is conviction after impeachment, then no pardon can be given either because said official WAS impeached. The point of the limit on impeachment is NOT to keep them in office by circumventing the Impeachment/Conviction mechanisms, which have extraordinarily high bars.
@PGAntioch @SethAbramson Because #HouseImpeachment is one thing and #SenateConviction is another. Straightforward: An impeached government official CANNOT be pardoned. If no conviction, then he/she stays in office, but then faces justice AFTER completion of term or appointment.

@ryan__morgan @RoKhanna @asymmetricinfo Keynesian stimulus depends on borrowing. If nobody will lend, then what good is the actual theory/practice?		If the @federalreserve cannot lower interest rates in a recession, what good is it to have 0% rates?		I'm talking balance: Tax during ups; stimulate during lows.
@ryan__morgan @RoKhanna @asymmetricinfo We pay interest! We don't pay principle.		My original point was about Keynesian stimulus. If we continue down this path, we won't have the ability to practice sound economic stimulus in times of need.		What about macro economics does that conflict with.
@ryan__morgan @RoKhanna @asymmetricinfo And sorry for the confusion. I didn't attend UNC-Chapel Hill ...		I'm a "#TarHeel" fan, but the designation in my profile refers to my being a North Carolinian.		I went to @WCU, and while it's part of the UNC-System, it is far from @UNC--literally and figuratively! :)

@ryan__morgan @RoKhanna @asymmetricinfo Yet that price depends on the faith of being paid, which you argue doesn't have to happen, in fact, isn't meant to happen!		American debt is a safe heaven, but for how long. I hate to argue qith somebody who holds a Ph.D. in economics, but I must.		Where did you get yours, again?
@ryan__morgan @RoKhanna @asymmetricinfo @BillClinton @newtgingrich So your master class in budget economis is ... "Fuck it!"?
"Nor is it meant to be payed off." https://t.co/XtmtN5wWTc
@ryan__morgan @RoKhanna @asymmetricinfo When @BillClinton and @newtgingrich balanced the budget, it was projected that our national debt would be cleared by 2012!!!		Then came tax cuts for the rich (twice), #911,, #Afghanistan, #Iraq, #MedicarePardD, #NoChildLeftBehind and a hole host of "unpaid fors."
@ryan__morgan @RoKhanna @asymmetricinfo WHAT?		HAHAHAHA		I understand that part of our debt is to ourselves (e.g. #SocialSecurity), but are you really saying that foreign countries who buy our debt don't expect to be paid back??		Now, who is it, here, who doesn't know what we are talking about?		Let's default, then.
@ryan__morgan @RoKhanna @asymmetricinfo Also, can you adress the point on stimulus spending and why in a down turn it is GOOD for government to pick up the slack.		If above is true, how can a government that has no fiscal wiggle room perform accordingly?
@ryan__morgan @RoKhanna @asymmetricinfo Although none of your tweet addresses our previous "conversation," I'll follow up non-sequiturly as well:		So ... How low and for how long does inflation have to be to magically pay $21 TRILLION?		Inflation decreasing may affect interest payment, but not overall debt.
@ryan__morgan @RoKhanna @asymmetricinfo #TaxesNotCuts ... How about that, @ryan__morgan?		"Clearly" you don't know what I'm talking about.
@ryan__morgan @RoKhanna @asymmetricinfo By the way, I'm a Keynesian guy. Just saying that for #Liberals/#Progressives to preach #KeynesianEconomics we must also preach to whole idea.		Deficits don't solve themselves between business cycles--much less the debt!
@ryan__morgan @RoKhanna @asymmetricinfo Expand, please. Because the way I understand a stimulus is to publicly grease the economy during a downturn, but if we keep borrowing during highs but never surplus then that power to grease goes away.		Or are you saying deficits and debt don't EVER matter?
@TaxReformExpert, I doubt everything you say about yourself on your profile. Do you know why?		...		Because you support @realDonaldTrump!		...		You'll be fine when recession shows up, so you don't give a shit about citizens below your pay scale!		#ImpeachTHISAsshole

@frugaloverload Can you hear me talking about #BDS at a synagogue, or about my believe in a #Jewish state of #Israel in a mosque???		Can you hear the same person speaking those two "incongruous" ideas anywhere in American politics?
@frugaloverload I've been hearing that since childhood.		Problem: America isn't ready for the millions of citizens like me.		My type is straightforward, blames dumb and apathetic citizens, love religions and yet blame them for some ills--above all, we love our nation but see most of its faults.
@frugaloverload I must admit: Your previous profile pic included what looked like a hijab, so I assumed ... well ... You know.		:)
@frugaloverload I've asked my #Jewish friend to take me to their synagogues, and I've asked my #Muslim friends to take me to their mosques ...		No luck. ALL answers: "Javi, you're too political."		HAHAHAHA ... FAITH *IS* POLITICAL!!!		#InterfaithRespect
@frugaloverload Yes.		I'm surprised at the fact that I seem to be the last #Catholic in my family.		During #Protestant services, I cross myself and people come to me afterward trying to convert me ... instead of ... I don't know ... JUST WELCOMING ME AND FRATERNIZING!!!
@frugaloverload I don't like #Protestant churches' politics. #Catholic politics are hard enough!		However, for my nephews and my niece, I went. Children singing, who can resist that?
@frugaloverload #Passion
@frugaloverload @googlenews To add: I just came back from a lovely #Christmas service at my brother's #BaptistChurch. I'm #Catholic.		The children love the community there and I back them up on that.		#GodBless and ... #WhoKnows?
Never proud of coursing, but--as an English major--I truly believe words are words and their meaning is in context, and passion! https://t.co/qzRrY1YTTU

@megaforte84 @mainulmizan @ReneeVoiceBrand @RonaldKlain @GOP I concur with that. However, every district in America--gerrymandered or not--can still be won by either party.		The key is citizens who can vote but aid in their defeat by a defeatist mentality ... as your example shows. Over 110M eligible voters don't bother, at all.
@mainulmizan @ReneeVoiceBrand @RonaldKlain @GOP Not really. #VoterSuppression is the outright manifestation of keeping voters out. #Gerrymandering is the packing and cracking of voters to elicit a pre-ordained result without worrying about keeping voters out.		The two, however, work hand in glove in maximizing desired effects.

@MykaNecohl @RepSwalwell @billmaher @HBO @RealTimers I understand. We, @TheDemocrats, talk of building a bench of talent in the #USHouse and #USSenate, but all the potential leaders in #Congress want to be president. Then they lose, retire, and decide to become lobbyists.
@billmaher and @RealTimers	Dakotas and the #USSenate, here it is:		The #USConstitution has a few unchangeable prescriptions. One is the number of senators!		Get off this topic! We cannot amend the damned thing to take senators. We could merger the Dakotas, but ain't gonna happen!

@jomei_miyuki @Freeyourmindkid @jennyoreeeally Well ... we can blame division on the hyphen, but some of us like the hyphen. It keeps our "roots" while displaying our "Americanness."		It's a choice, really; not divisive.		We are all Americans, but we like to keep our heritage from before. That's OK if done without hate.

@RogerWAllison @realDonaldTrump @POTUS I appreciate the answer; however, your suggestion that @HillaryClinton made "the same assertion" seem dubiously disingenuous.		I have never heard any candidate for the Presidency, much less the incumbent @POTUS, make the sordid assertions of power that @realDonaldTrump has made.
@realDonaldTrump Since you don't read, this is another lie!
Thank God that #SCOTUS ruled narrowly on #MasterpieceCakeshop because, having reheard the oral arguments, I have to say that #Colorado's #AGFrederickYarger's performance was aweful. Let's just say he was not ripe for the U.S. Supreme Court.		He was not prepared for the Justices.

@RogerWAllison Do you agree with @realDonaldTrump's recent Constitutional assertions, i.e. that a @POTUS can pardon himself, -can personally open and close investigations, and -cannot obstruct justice?		Whether a lawyer or not, Mr. Allison, you would be a Member of Congress.		Thx
That @TheDemocrats would dare gloat with we-told-you-so's about @realDonaldTrump's incompetence doesn't mean we are rooting for failure; it means that we have very little faith in his ability to focus to accomplish one critial goal: #KoreanPeace.		https://t.co/eDzmCdx7ZA
