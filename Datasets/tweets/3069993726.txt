@mikecasazza Frankly I thought Esa Ahmad was the laziest player in recent memory and Wes Harris was more off than on, so these dismissals are insignificant. This allows more development &amp; playing time for guys who need it.

@MarkKaboly So you are really saying that the Steeler organization has allowed 6.5 years to pass all the while turmoil, lack of discipline and League reputation has eroded. To insinuate a specific contract is more than coincidence is what the media does. Make shit up. #Groundbreaking

@rezzhead @SEC_Chuck Oh I don‚Äôt hate. Envious yes but don‚Äôt hate at all
@JFowlerESPN Why does Tomlin sound so stupid all the time?
@SEC_Chuck With that said the rest of college football looks forward to Nick Saban‚Äôs retirement and parity returning to college football
@davidpollack47 NCAA athletics have been far more inclusive in all other sports except football. It is a shame that media hype and opinion polls determine the CFB Playoff. Expand it to 8 teams, get in line with all the sports and give schools like UCF a legitimate chance
@MarkKaboly OR make an incredibly stupid pass at the goal line, or inexcusably use two timeouts in the second half because of confusion.
@MitchVingle Either way it will not be WVU...
@MitchVingle @NFL_MNF I know it still stings
@colin_dunlap Steelers made it easy for them. For as good as Ben was he was equally as bad, several bad passes, costly picks, boneheaded read at the goal line. I don‚Äôt care if you are a HOF QB don‚Äôt use my timeouts because we can‚Äôt get a play lined up or called correctly.

Bold move by KU as Kansas hires Les Miles. Great choice, proven college football winner. It might take a couple of seasons but If Les Miles can raise KU football close to a level LSU saw under Miles, well look out BIg 12.
Clearly the Jags want to win more than the Steelers. Why can‚Äôt Tomlin motivate anyone?

@RonCookPG @PittsburghPG AB had good stats and yet so many other things wrong with this team. Lack of preparedness, terrible defense, no LeVeon Bell, Tomlin‚Äôs approach, how can you make this all about AB? If you want to blame AB, you need to lump Tomlin into the mix. Tomlin sets the tone.

@parkerhurley @PaulZeise You are right if the 26th player wasn‚Äôt named Tiger Woods with more Majors than anyone on tour who is climbing back into relevancy.  Golf is a lot like NASCAR in that people have their favorites and stay with them. TV ratings prove his draw, how is this bad in any way for golf?
@parkerhurley @PaulZeise That is one reason people are watching. Does he still have it? He has climbed to number 26 on the tour. How is that just one of the guys? That is still elite.
@parkerhurley @PaulZeise I tuned in when he made his run wondering if he could tie the most ever PGA Championship wins at 5. There are a lot of old timers who want Tiger to fail so Jack‚Äôs legacy remains. I don‚Äôt think it has anything to do with these young players
@parkerhurley @PaulZeise younger guys only have heard what it was like when Tiger was nearly unbeatable. Why would they fear a guy who had fallen off the golf scene for years. Tiger is polarizing. Some still see him as a once in a lifetime player, none of these other guys are even close to that.
@parkerhurley @PaulZeise everything surrounding Tiger goes beyond nostalgia. Controversy, struggle, comeback, dominance. Tiger is relevant as he pressed the top of the leaderboard. I was in the camp of Tiger won‚Äôt win again, but I don‚Äôt believe that anymore. Tiger is prowling
@PaulZeise @parkerhurley I walked Augusta on the final Sunday this year and the only time crowds grew larger than the crowds that followed Tiger hole to hole were the final 4 holes. Tiger had been in the clubhouse for an hour. That will not change regardless of who else is at the top of the leaderboard

So many comments by fans leaving Augusta National yesterday about how fan sentiment was rooting against Reed. Whether it was because they wanted to see a playoff or someone else win it, it was clear to those there Reed won against the field and the fans
The 2018 Masters came down to the wire with Patrick Reed doing just enough to win. Spieth and Casey had phenomenal rounds each narrowly missing the course record. Tiger easily has the biggest crowds followed by Lefty, Rory, Bubba, Spieth  and Fowler.
As Patrick Reed walked up the 9th fairway on Saturday it was as if the leader was expected to falter. Very limited fan appreciation it was surreal almost like a movie star walking through an airport unrecognized
Incredible day at the Master‚Äôs on Sunday. It was incredible to see Patrick Reed hold on for the coveted Green Jacket. Despite the overwhelming fan disappointment Reed won in spite of fans rooting on Spieth and Fowler. Pretty amazing to watch happen.

Brady sucks
Pass interference against New England not called, unreal
He caught the ball, made 3 steps, and dove to the end zone. He was a runner. He was never making a catch going to the ground

@CampaignBreezo The video does not show an official who spots the ball. Being able to clearly see when the ball is marked is critical to whether these videos mean anything. Officials tend to manage the clock pretty well, Brady didn‚Äôt invent the signal for addressing the play clock - lunacy

@Steelersdepot You can clearly see the nose of the ball on the ground? Can you tell if his hand is under the ball? Do you have irrefutable proof? If not and I can‚Äôt see that proof the play stands as called on the field
Here is the rule at the NFL. https://t.co/wjj55gKdOm. Watch the replay there is ZERO definitive TV angle showing the ball touch the ground. Does the ball move yes, but with a hand under the ball the receiver is allowed to regain control of the ball prior to touching the ground.
@MarkMaddenX The rule does not apply if he makes a football move. It would have been a fumble but wouldn‚Äôt matter because he broke the plane. This debate is so stupid and the rule is even worse.
@brentmusburger The problem with this rule is that you are saying a player must retain control through the ground for it to be a catch; we all know that as a runner the ground cannot cause a fumble. So really aren‚Äôt we arguing about a whether a football move occurred? Lunge = football move
@Dameshek So Tony Gonzalez never existed right?
Hey @chriscarter80 if you are on the committee who changed the rule you need to resign from it. That is a terrible rule. James had caught the ball and broke the goal line. The ground caused the ball to move. His football move after putting his knee on the ground was lunging. Dumb https://t.co/pycXY6F6wn
