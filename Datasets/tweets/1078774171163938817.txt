@IlhanMN Racism with different masters! This world is filled with so much hate and disrespect why. What makes any of us better?  Sinners who disobey his word, and choose to pass judgement on others, will pay by his hand! Father, please have mercy, for they know not, what they do!
@aawjennings @TheOfficerTatum @IlhanMN Racism at its best. Father, forgive these people that have no respect for your children. White is not right! How easy people forget who god is, and what his laws are.  But it's his name they call when he calls for you.  God please Have mercy!
@rujaal @TheOfficerTatum @IlhanMN Thank you
@berni1706 @TheOfficerTatum @IlhanMN Thank you
@TheOfficerTatum A man of God, passing judgement!  Well, at least he has Confessed his sins. As you commit one of God's ultimate sin. I find it hard to believe you are a true man of God. If so why pass judgement? Are you better then him with all your sins?  Father forgive him and his evil ways!
@TheOfficerTatum @realDonaldTrump You say your a man of God, but you would put your trust in a racist pig, who would call you a Niger to your face. Come on brother, wake up. The man jokes about, with his power he can touch a womans privates withoit care and your ok with that? I pray you don't have daughters!
@TheOfficerTatum @IlhanMN That is very disrespectful, who are you to judge? Greed has consumed us as people that people will steal from ones own mother. A world without honor, or respect! Gods law, is law! Read your Bible it's clear as day. You should ask God for forgiveness for your disrespectful manner.
Our country. The Marines code of honor, holds the highest standard of Disapline, for Unbecoming A Solder! How ironic, they are charged with the protection of the president.  And yet this president THE COMMANDER AND CHIEF, gets a pass? Division creates defeat, we need unity now!
Was to show the world is that the people of this country has no morals and we enjoy kicking anyone to include our own peole. Why should or would anyone want to be our allies. By far the most embarrassing moment in our history. This possible scandal, is a permanent stain on
This is, moving forward, the norm of our country. Our country lacks unity, and today's continuous badgering of Cohen when you know the entire world is watching while the countries president is away.  how does that make us look as a country on the world stage. All you accomplished
The American people deserve to know that if our president has not committed a crime, that at least he is becoming of the office.  How can we expect our veterans and solders to follow this code of Honor, but the commander and chief does not? There is a major disconnect if
@GOP WOW, this was the most disgusting display of how only white is right by our congressman/woman. Which went way wrong! Not even a handful of questions as to why he was really there. Trump maybe the president but does not excuse his behavior. Is this not important enough issue?
@GOPChairwoman @GOP @Jim_Jordan Taking kickbacks for self gain to pass laws is a crime too. Just cause no one has been caught, is still no excuse. Trump makes himself look bad without help. Example: saying blacks are too stupid to vote for him, im sure no Republicans will have to worry about that thanks to him
@LindseyGrahamSC @GOP @realDonaldTrump The PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES should not have ever engaged in any of this garbage. No one would ever have to worry about all this happening. Especially, while he is TRYING to make a deal with Korean leadership. Our govt needs to find a better way to deal with Korea!
Will fall out, prove me wrong! None of you care about the American people. What the people of this country need to do is check all of you as none of you deserve to be in office. What a disgrace and laughing stock of the world we have become. It Needs to stop!
You take the people's money and want to say your working on behalf of your constituents. The real truth is none of your constituents see any of your kick backs. So before you start pointing fingers, start with yourselves. Turn Congress upside down, a ton of criminal's
President knowing that there is so much dishonesty and disrespect. With this entire situation. At what point will they challenge the president for his dishonesty, and lies. A great bunch of you doing the same as them both but you have not been caught yet time tells all!!!
@GOP Republicans are a bunch of hypocrites. A bunch of you politicians take illegal KICKBACKS to make policy! Your Creditabity as a party is an abomination. The party is just as curpt as the mob prove me wrong! I believe the party is in favor for Russia as they take up for the
@realDonaldTrump @mattgaetz Know one will make an international deal with this presidency! The world, to include Kim Jong-Un will be watching Cohen. With that much accusations, all of it can't be lies. Even A child knows Muller has already done his checks and balances on Cohen.The truth will set you free!!!
@realDonaldTrump @mattgaetz You are a joke!
@mattgaetz I wish I would have saw you bully, and put your hands on someone.  Because you're white and connected in politics you think you can get away with anything. WE SEE YOU. It's people like you you, that makes our country look like shit, to the rest of the world. Good job scumbag!!
@rcpvideo @mattgaetz You lie to the American People.  What makes you any better?
@mattgaetz You DO NOT want, to get to the TRUTH!  You just want to LIE to the AMERICAN PEOPLE which says a lot about your character!  So if you want to defend a racist, liar, and a cheat with PROOF.  Then it's safe to say you are also a liar, cheat AND RACIST! WAY TO GET OUR ATTENTION!!!
@mattgaetz you should resign! And Prosecuted for,  witness tampering ,  if you are allowed to remain in office it just goes to show, that our country is still run by a racist democracy.  WE THE PEOPLE pay elected officials and presidents to work on our behalf, Whos the liar now?
@mattgaetz If you wanna call feces a treasure.    We now know, that Trump is a racist pig!  So what does that say about all his followers, now that, THE AMERICAN PEOPLE know the truth!  Calling Michael Cohen a lier, now holds no weight. Should of left his testimony alone!!!!

@AnnCoulter You're the hoax, trying to get the white House goffer to follow your views. You are a disgrace to this country. If you wanna make political policy apply for a dam job. Stop using your status to call people out.
@TheKuhnerReport @AOC I would love, to debate you on your show. I know that all you Republicans think the president is a smart man, which tells the world youre just as stupid as he is.  Any debate aginst someone with any kind of common since would make you look just as the stupid people you follow.
@realDonaldTrump You embrace white supremacy, and consider humanity blasphemy! Don't hide behind your presidential status Be a MAN! Admit you promote white is right! Its a way wrong answer, especially when immigrants blanket our nation to include yours. Either Get on board, or get out the way!!!
@Tongueofwood @tonyposnanski @realDonaldTrump Lol ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚
@LindaSuhler @realDonaldTrump How's he great, riding the coat tails of former presidens? America is and will always be great. With all his lies, scandles, and investigations, I would say by far, the worst president ever.  You cant walk into the white house snap your fingers and shit happens. That's fake news!
@ChatByCC @realDonaldTrump You,smokin the same stuff he is. He is not even close to being an ok president. How can you respect a man who can't tell the truth,  divides the country, and has no respect for his fellow immigrants. He forget where he came from, how can the people trust he knows where hes going!
@realDonaldTrump Stop letting influencers cloud your judgement. You bluffed, played your hand and lost, move on. A real man can swallow his pride, and shoot for the stars after learning such an incredible lesson in defeat. You can't win everything. You need to ask Jesus for humility and wisdom!
@realDonaldTrump You lucky WE THE PEOPLE, gave you what you got!, Especially seeing Mexico anit paying for it!  Now you wanna BS THE PEOPLE about how DEMS are not for border security! Are you smoking something? No wonder you were never a successful business man. Gambling with our money is not ok!
@IlhanMN Amen!!!

@Talley616 @ChelseaClinton @IlhanMN Cause want she said was true.  Are you people that stupid to think Washington works without kick backs lol
@Campbellt23Tim @ChelseaClinton @IlhanMN Take a look at trumps apologies on grabbing woman's private parts and then you will see a forced ingenue apologie
@LexSportsCards @ChelseaClinton @IlhanMN Are you joking right now. He makes Hitler look like a chior boy. The man has no respect for you, me, or anyone that does not have a million dollars or more as spending money. The man is nasty on so many levels and disloyal to the American people
@Bambam8109 @ChelseaClinton @IlhanMN look who is racist now! Do you really think, she would be a senitor, without an FBI background check.Think before you speak! That is so racist of you to say, knowing the president is ripping the country apart with Racism.
@taylor99840462 @ChelseaClinton @IlhanMN Oh yeah, like his locker room talk about grabbing a woman's private parts is real president like right?  You probably don't have kids.Grow up and understand, the man is a pig and you are condoning his nasty behavior!!! Think before you speak
@SteveBast @ChelseaClinton @IlhanMN Because she apologized, does not mean that its not true!!! Everyone in Congress gets paid under the table.  Don't be blind to the fact of how Washington works.
@davidmweissman @ChelseaClinton @IlhanMN Fake Christian! The VP is Spineless, and can't make a decision to save his own life. Half of time he is asleep. The man services no purpose in life, to just sit ideally by, and let the commander and chief disrespect the very fabric of our country, says a lot about his character!!
@TheRightMelissa @ChelseaClinton @IlhanMN What does any of that mean if its not genuine.  The man is a pig, the only reason his son in law is on the picture is cause he has money.  You really think he would have let Kanye West date his daughter?  Hell, he even said "he would date his own daughter" what father says that?
@ChelseaClinton @IlhanMN It's because he is a racist pig with A cobweb VP.  DT thinks he can say and do whatever he wants, without Consequence. In turn he feels white is right! Until he is held accountable the country will continue to Selfdistruct. FULL STOP!
@offbeatoliv Depends on what you look like lol. It could be all 3 reasons.
@thenebean9 @Scuba200ft @fwdale @IlhanMN No, he is just a racist pig.
@Scuba200ft @fwdale @IlhanMN What a racist pig, thanks for showing your true colors bozo. Her literacy was more important vs. the rape and killing of a 12 year old girl by a US solder. I'm sure god will see fit to bless you and your family in the same fashion. Good luck bozo! God sees and knows all!
@fwdale You would much rather like the idea of a 12 year old being raped, and killed over a woman's literacy. I pray god,  serves you the same treatment.  Only a racist scumbag would point that out. Thanks for showing your true colors.
@fwdale I bet, not one of you racist pigs, would say that to my face! But you can pick on a woman thats of color right. As we all can see, racism has not disappeared.  What a disgraceful and despicable human being you are! You people are less than human, even a maggot has more respect.
@t_robthomas @carenbWoke @pablitoalves75 @IlhanMN @realDonaldTrump Amen
@realDennisLynch @MadHominem @IlhanMN @realDonaldTrump Trump makes Hitler look like a choir boy. Anyone that supports him, would love to see anyone of color back in shackles. What a despicable man that lies and would gladly destroy this country for self gain. Fix that fist before you point fingers at anyone of color. God is watching!
@IlhanMN @realDonaldTrump Trump is not above god, then to have his Spineless cabinet defend him. He is a racist pig that should be taken out of office before he infects the rest of the world. He spits on the American people like we are all his slaves and laugh in our face. That's our commander and chief?
@IlhanMN How dare the spineless VP and our racist pig of a president lash out @ you when on a daily basis the president spits on America and it's people. And then to lie, defraud and disrespect this country so proudly with his base. How disgusting it is that his party defends him
@iskandrah @AOC @IlhanMN Amen!!!
@realDonaldTrump You nasty, racist, bigot, and all the Republicans that allow you to remain in office. How dare you point fingers at anyone, for the god given right to freedom of speech, when you say vile things like grabbing woman privates!! Your cabinet has no morals to defend a man like you.
@donlemon donald chump, a nasty bigot. the nasty things he says, with all his base laughing as he disrespects the fabric of our county. How dare Republicans allow him to remain in office. They are all clearly racist to allow this much disrespect to our country. God help us all!

@realDonaldTrump I really hoped that you would have gotten out of your own shadow and think more of the American people.  However,  I see you are not interested in the people how elected you president. You are only interested in your own agenda about a wall.
RT @kimguilfoyle: An example of what Police officers do every day. #thankyou https://t.co/u0nS8ZtkDR
@SpeakerPelosi so many post that have nothing to do with the Holocaust. The disrespect is disgusting. how quickly everyone forgot about all the people we lost last few years, sad to see these post. People have no remorse or respect.  However, GOD Bless YOU, our departed AND OUR GREAT NATION!!!
@realDonaldTrump This wall is going to be your greatest downfall. A national emergency is not a smart move. Reach out to Nancy it would add to your power move on booth sides of the isle. You both are smart people you will not always agree,  but it helps move things along for the next 24 months.
@realDonaldTrump Not ever one on both sides will agree.I also, don't always agree with you. However, thank you for considering the American people first. Follow up with a better plan for border security we need a wall in some important areas. Let's start there!
@SpeakerPelosi @realDonaldTrump It would be helpful, and it would give him a better sence of your roll, his roll, and what's fair game in govt. We are the people, between the two of you, I'm more than positive, it can help all elected officials make better decisions for the people of this great country.
@SpeakerPelosi @realDonaldTrump Thank you speaker Pelosi, for your plea for the American people. It would also, be in the best interest for the American people, if you and our president could exclude, everyone in both cabinets and discuss what is in the people's best interest. Helps with  boundaries of respect
@realDonaldTrump Forget about it a witch hunt. You don't have time, your next two years are important with 27 days wasted.Let others deal with the wall and deal with the American people. Do a better job in order to win the people, Congress will not get you a second term, the American people will.
@realDonaldTrump great job opening govt, you don't have time to waste on the Muller case whatever happens, happens you know how involved you were in this case. Whatever you did you know the already know the outcome. Put all your focus on the american people thats more important!
@peterbakernyt @nytimes At what point will anyone give the man credit when it's due. I'm not a huge fan however, he showed compassion for the American people and took politics out of the equation. And for that, he gets  disrespected and his compassion makes him weak.That is wrong and and very shameful.
@RickSantorum @AC360 Rick I was not happy with you last night but tonight,  you are the man with your comments tonight. Thank you for making that point it was classic and right.  I'm not a big Trump fan, however when credit is do it should be given Trump made a power move with opening up the govt
@seanhannity It's not about the wall, it's about THE PEOPLE! Politics is playing way to much with people's lives. We don't elect officials to play with the people of this country. I would advise Trump, and Nancy to set aside there issues and hammer out what is best for the American people.
@realDonaldTrump Don't listen to everyone, today you made a power move. Thank you, for doing what's best for the American people, and the safety of air travel. Now its time for you and, Nancy to host a private meeting to do what's best for the United States. God bless America, and our President!

@realDonaldTrump WHAT ARE YOU DOING If a mass amount of Americans die on flights over your Wall you will have no backing, the entire country will condemn you. Do the right thing or your presidency will be over before you can make another decision on behalf of the American people.
@realDonaldTrump Come on, really with that lame shit. You act like you cured cancer or some shit. Stop acting like you got big ass balls cause you said some slick shit to some foreign diplomats. Turn around, we the people, are all watching you.
@realDonaldTrump Stop bragging so much. that does not make you look any better. You look like an idiot when you do that. You need to take it down a Notch Tonto.Silence is so much more distinguished, and becoming of a President. You have not done more than any other president before you.#RPWRP
@realDonaldTrump That was so Stupid whoever came up with that just dumb. Be serious for once in your life. Got your parents are rolling over in there graves. You really can't be this ignorant? STOP letting your people make you look incompetent. Really let your people starve for a wall? #RPWRP
@realDonaldTrump Won't be for long with a shit down. You do the math.  If people are not making money it puts a strain on the economy, if your shut down last 1 or 2 more pay periods people will become desperate. So your doing this on purpose or WOW! Your people got you looking a fool. #RPWRP
@realDonaldTrump Either someone told you to say this dumb shit, or your not to bright! Those idiots around you, make you look like a fool.This wall, get over it your buddies fucked you.Your wall might stop 2% of product,but they walk in 98% of it either under ground or POE! Open the govt! #RPWRP
@realDonaldTrump STOP! STOP! STOP don't be a douche bag.Airing people's dirty laundry. WOW! I can't belive you just did that. NEW YORKERS don't DO that.That was some real shitty shit. How can you expect people to respect you, doing some shit like this. WOW! You crossed the line.True violation
@realDonaldTrump DT you GOTTA be smarter than this! Right?Listen I know you have a lot of people that claim they know what's in your best interest don't trust any of them.Thats been your biggest issue Ty for your respect to Senator Pelosi. Forget that wall, and your pride. #RPWRP
@realDonaldTrump That is not the only way crime happens! You're making more of it than what it really is! look at all these other states crime is all over I agree that drugs come into this country illegally but the border is not the root of the problem. Sorry dude, your theory is all wrong.
@realDonaldTrump @foxandfriends How is it doing great?You shut down the govt.We the people will not allow you to starve us out so you can control our society.
@realDonaldTrump You lied and now you threaten his family.What are you hiding?So what, if his family is just as Grimmie as you.The United States is not investigating him!We the people &amp; govt is investigating you!He did your dirty work, now you look real guilty. I hope, what you did was worth it.
@realDonaldTrump "Mexico is going to pay for the wall, and enjoy it". Now Americans have to pay for the wall? I dont remember that in any speech? Now the govt is shut down.That was not the plan.Why should the United States shut down its govt to pay for the wall. Americans did not agree to this.

@realDonaldTrump Work this hard for our vets, have you ever walked into a va hospital? What of the homeless situations, or maybe all the other issues that pague this country. Tunnels with AC seems to be more of an issue then the wall.  That wall is to keep us in, not keep people out!
@Kim67945407 @monae75 @WeAreOne_Q @realDonaldTrump He didn't take the 25 billion to secure borders within the first quarter of 2018. Then he got 1.8 billion in the last quarter used only a 3rd of it. None of that 3rd went towards border security.Why give more if the current amount has not been used for its intended use.
@realDonaldTrump You should of taken the 25 billion last year, why dont you use the money you got you got last quarter? And to be honest. Who's building a wall for that much money? I could do it for half. Stop blaming everyone for your fuck ups! Be a man and take responsibility for your actions!
@BBCWorld Race war soon to erupt as part of your master plan, of course you will do nothing as always. Funny how you weigh in on people of color but you never weigh in on the real travestys of this country. You always weigh in after the fact. Read your dealy breliefings.
@realDonaldTrump No you are the true enemy. looks like the plan was always to cripple the country through Famine, Racism, and Disease. Our govt. Will never open cause the wall is to keep us in!  China, Russia, N Korea ðŸ¤” whose missing. Wake up people! Tyranny is amongst us, Prove me wrong!
@seanhannity Your Vampire boss should be arrested for being threat to our national security,and whatever other charges they have on him. And you, reporting his blood sucking ways ripping the country apart. Youre a no good friend, You're all disrespectful bullies with bad karma.
@realDonaldTrump Now we know, why you discussed "Adaption". Deliberately taking kids from parents by the thousands, to overwhelm the system. Now you control what kids go where, but it's funny now no one knows what happened to the kids now that there parents have been deported
@realDonaldTrump @seanhannity Lies
@realDonaldTrump I see what you are doing Horseman! You are making everyone think you are fighting for a wall, so you can destroy our economy. Bring us to the brink of starvation and disease which will easily be responsible for more than 1,000,000 excess deaths. Wake up Revelations is here!
The greatest trick the devil ever pulled was convincing the world he didn't exist. Remember the four Horsemen in revolutionsup!  Also, there will be great earthquakes, famines and pestilences in various places, and fearful events and great signs from heaven. Wake up!
@SpeakerPelosi please see the writting on the wall, with this shut down, Russia, and now the loss of soilders in Sryia? Our economy is starting to fail, and people are becoming desperate!!! I implore you to take more force, before constituents gravely suffer, from total losses.
@SenateFloor Are both sides not seeing the writting on the wall, with this shut down, Russia, and now the loss of soilders in Sryia? Our economy is starting to fail, and people are becoming desperate!!! I implore you to take more force before anymore constituents gravely suffer.
@realDonaldTrump You are so disrespectful and plan nasty, even if it were true.Karma has your name written all over it.People have lost everything that money can't buy, You don't care about the  American people, you only care about power. But, your treason train is about to take off without you.
@SpeakerPelosi Nancy, is it possible, for people that ate affected by the government shut down,  are they able to collect temp unemployment till the government opens back up.  Families shouldn't have to suffer.  There should be a back up plan to help families in this situation.
@realDonaldTrump You are just a bad petson,   there is nothing v that can be done to help you.  May God have mercy on you.  All this greed is going to catch up to you and your family.  You refuse to work with anyone so nothing gets done which seems real common when it comes to the American peple.
@realDonaldTrump You doing a lot of finger pointing but you are the one messing everything  up. How you plan on running when you have way too many Republicans that would never back you. so if your looking to run you need to clean up all the mess you created.  Your playing with people's lives.
@realDonaldTrump I'm confused, you have not shown what the cost of the wall will be. And to make matters worse,  you had 25 billion dollars in exchange for the dreamers program, and once again you turned that down.  And too add to that you don't even spend what they gave you
@realDonaldTrump The entire world is waiting on you?  Get some bids, present them to Congress and lets get the bills signed and move forward.  This is not rocket science.
@realDonaldTrump You didn't really mean to say that, did you?  If you really think that, you really need help sir. Your train of thought is way too toxic on way too many, not so normal, levels. https://t.co/G2u0zWoS5A
@realDonaldTrump Now that, is fake news!
@realDonaldTrump Sir! You have way to much pride, and your ego will get you in trouble.  Put your interest aside, look at how the country is upside down and pay more attention to what is going on around you. Are you, trying to destroy the country, you swore to defend?
@realDonaldTrump You said Mexico, will pay for the wall. You never mentioned, the American people would have to stop living there lives. Why don't you treat Mexico the same? I guess it's easier to treat us like we don't matter. This is a mess. The JOB is NOT getting DONE! You have to much pride.
@realDonaldTrump Why are we not use the detection technology that was created to protect the secret compound area 51. Or build a military base that protects the southern border it works at NSGB aka Guantanamo Bay. How you ganna make America great again, if you dont use your thinking cap?
@realDonaldTrump Under the corrugated steel plates that divide the U.S. and Mexico border in Otay Mesa, dozens of clandestine cross-border drug tunnels slash through the soil. How much will go towards that? Use what we have. https://t.co/lsU900qeSS
know one, will pay that kind of money without some real black and white figures. How can you come up with a number, that carries a tune of 5 Billion without any kind of contractor bids. Who came up with that fig anyway?  Explain your reasonings, lets all get on the same page.
@realDonaldTrump @FoxNews Dems made offers!  However, you dismissed them.  Pointing fingers makes our government look disorganized,  and Dysfunctional. Everone is pointing fingers, but know one is coming up with a solution for this wall. Get contractor bids and present it to Congress then work on the wall
@realDonaldTrump you are one man, you are not perfect. You can't fight the world on your own.  At the pace your moving, and all that you are trying to fix, you will do more harm than good. A smart man tries to make things happen. A wise man moves mountains. Use your team.
@realDonaldTrump You have too slow down.  Please, come to terms with the notion that politics, is not business. Mistakes are being made, and you are not in control of your surroundings. Fix your cabinet and delegate.
@realDonaldTrump Your kidding right?  We as humans should own any death of a child.  That's not anyones fault, or political parties to blame. The death of a child is tragic. Are you without a heart? That wall is meaningless, if it does not protect the people on both sides.
@realDonaldTrump BP should've started an IV &amp; medevac her out, if it was that bad?  Why build a wall,  when Homeland is dropping immigrants off illegally in El Paso.Thats not smart, dump them in a new country, where they don't know a soul, no ID, just a good luck and a bye. Who's fault is that?
@realDonaldTrump I'll save the millennials some time ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚,  CarpentersÂ construct, erect, install, and repair structures and fixtures made from wood and other materials. And painters paint, on things, not a tablets. Keeping things old school  I see ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚.
@realDonaldTrump Making America great again!  Looks to me things are getting worse? You know when shits the fan when we have to  "Trade my services to perform maintenance in exchange for partial rent payments". ðŸ¤¨,  I don't think we are all on the same page.
@realDonaldTrump Quick question,  why should the American people suffer without pay,  when you promised Mexico, was going to pay for the wall?  Looks like we are paying for the wall due to the shutdown, and we have to work twice as hard to cover the missed bills due to all this.
@realDonaldTrump you should really try reaching out to former presidents, for wisdom and understanding. We as people, are not too old to receive advice.  learn something new can't hurt you, can only make you a better person. Being  a bully, will not get you anywhere.
@realDonaldTrump this shutdown is getting way out of control.  Your compassion, would make you a better looking president, then keeping people out of work. They cant even pay there bills. It's bad enough, people don't make enough to save a dime, paycheck to paycheck sucks.
@realDonaldTrump is getting the wall really making America great again? Homeland security, is just dropping people off in el Paso with no documents.  Hell,why go through the border, when homeland will pay for your greyhound ticket?
@realDonaldTrump taking less money for a wall is not a loss.  If you combine what we have and what you get would be better, than making American families suffer.  I just feel, you don't have the American peoples best interest at heart.
@realDonaldTrump Area 51 for many years, you could not get within 2 miles and we didn't have a wall, just gates.  So why is a wall that important, use the technology we already have to secure our border.  A wall will not stop immigrants, when they can simply come in underground.
