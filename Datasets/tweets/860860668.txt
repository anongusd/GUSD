Most of all, we need to take out their funding. That's how you do it! I am not any intelligence agent; it's just common sense.
With each attack; we find out that ISIS network is deeper and broader. We take out their social media center, their training centers in Raqq
The world needs to realize that this is not going away! It's growing exponentially.This Isamic Network is deeper and broader.
People, this is coming our way! We have to bomb Raqqa, the capital of the Islamic state. Let's form the Coalition to bomb their capital.

He donated much more to the Dems. His ideology seems to be more in tune with them, if you've followed the debates, you know this.
Yeah, Trump donated big bucks to the Dems party and its most prestigious members( Clintons). Even though he did donated some to some Repubs
He masters the art of "baiting" to create an immediate response from him that seems spontaneous, but it's not. He used to be a Dem,
Trump has a big mouth, excellent recognition( cause of his tv programs)and knows how to use his facial expressions to create a response.
Trump does not have a plan. He speaks in generalities, without giving any specifics.When someone asks him how, he simply repeats himself.
Every time a journalist or another fellow Repub asks Trump about his plan; he repeats the same slogans: " I will make America great again"

How will we respond here in the US? Will we be complacent or finally take this seriously and make this our priority?
We need to penetrate and infiltrate those terror networks. It is the only way to defeat them! Please. No more political correctness.
We need to take the threat of ISIS seriously. This French attack was a failure of intelligence and politics.
The specificity and coordination of these French jihadists was impressive. Seven of these attackers blown themselves... Horrific &amp; merciless
There is a jihadist franchise all over the world. Our national security should be first. Our lives are at risk! Zero political correctness!
Also, Obama stated that ISIS "was contained". ISIS had recruited over 60,000 jihadists this past year. We need to take this seriously.
Yesterday, because of the death of jihadi john, president Obama stated that ISIS was "shrinking ". Really, Mr President? This is WRONG!

@AtoFindata you don't know me. I am Puertorican. I came to America with $100.00 in my pocket and 2 children. I worked and studied.

@AtoFindata my recommendation to you is not to read books about victimization or slavery. Read about success and how to achieve your dreams.

Ignorance has no color. People has to stop putting labels on people. There are ordinary people doing good things, serving their communities

@DmiLlz516 if you lawyer up, things will usually go your way. If you're poor forget it. You can be black or white...
@DmiLlz516 I vote for whom I think can do a better job. I am non partisan. I hate "labels". I think this country is literary going down down
@DmiLlz516 I go to government sites for stats so that people don't accuse me of being a Republican which I am not.
@DmiLlz516 when I got a divorce, I was on food stamps, and government assistance for a while. I got a better job and ended up the assistance
@DmiLlz516 and there are those who "know every trick in the book to stay in that dependency.
@DmiLlz516 yes. I do think it is a lot worse! Government dependency in a lot of cases is a form of slavery. There are those who need it.
@DmiLlz516 I totally know that. The government has two set of books: the one open to the public and the real one. It's usually worse!!
@DmiLlz516 how do you know that? I used to be a Hispanic single mother with two kids  and no child support. You can imagine the rest....
@77cruiser @BenCarson2016 I totally agree with that. I think that "common Core in our school should be banned. It's about time to reform edu
@AtoFindata Victimization curtails your independence &amp; self reliance. I know a lot of African Americans owners of their own businesses.
@AtoFindata African Americans should be proud of their heritage by honoring it. Again: work &amp; study hard. Be responsible.
@AtoFindata Fight the good fight to be better. Study hard. Work hard.it's not easy. It takes discipline to say no to gangs &amp; easy money.
@AtoFindata blacks can change that. They don't have to continue living on government dependency. That is a form of slavery that traps you.
@DmiLlz516 The history of America started with immigrants looking for freedom.Slavery was horrible and a thing of the past.
@DmiLlz516 My numbers were taken from the government DOJ website at the beginning of the year. Just facts.
@DmiLlz516 I know, that's why I go to the facts found in numbers from the government site. Nothing wrong with that.
@AtoFindata Education, good decisions, hard honest work should be goals to pursue. They are liberating and you feel free and empowered.
@AtoFindata since you are suggesting books on the subject. I will suggest that you read Dr. Carson's bio. Excellent reading.
@DmiLlz516 news flash. This is a social media site and you are posting answering my posts. I have the same right as you to answer.
By the way, for those who think that I am racist: black blood runs through my veins and proud of my Puertorican heritage.
Just ask .Dr. Ben Carson.: black, in a single mother family and poor. Sheer work, good study ethics &amp; discipline took him to excel.
Ppl of any race or condition can improve.good decisions, hard work, and an education will improve anyone. Nothing to do with race.
@AtoFindata Agreed. It so happens that the highest rates are among blacks. Nothing to do with race. Everything to do with actions, decisions
@DmiLlz516 @AtoFindata @Azi @BilldeBlasio . I haven't said that. Every race can improve. Responsibility, hard work, &amp; community service
@AtoFindata @DmiLlz516 @Azi @BilldeBlasio I believe in numbers. They more than substantiate discussions. They put reality into any context.
@DmiLlz516 I have the right and freedom of speech that all Americans do. I will post whatever I decide &amp; will continue to do so.
@DmiLlz516 There has to be a honest conversation among blacks on these issues. Responsibility, education and good parenting are essential.
@DmiLlz516 what I said was that the greatest percentage in jail, are blacks. This is found at the DOJ.teenage pregnancy, &amp; homicides also.
I hope that Obama will demand Amir's freedom before anything else. For starters, I can't believe that he puts his trust in a country(Iran).

@AnneBayefsky I love this cartoon because it is true. Political Correctness is killing this nation.
It was very refreshing to see the president of Egypt speaking against the terror attacks and against Radical Islamic Terrorism.
@AnneBayefsky this is sooo true! Wake up!
@DanaPerino @greta All media outlets thorought the world should reprint the Charlie Hedo cartoons in solidarity with the victims of terror.
@GOPwhispers news organizations should reprint all the Charlie Hebdo cartoons. Will they have the guts?
@GOPwhispers where is the president, playing golf?
@GOPwhispers I did not see the ambassador in the front row marching with the world leaders. Why?
Prove that it is bull.
@ShepNewsTeam the absence of president Obama in Paris is inexcusable!!sending Eric Holder is an insult to the victims of terror.
The absence of president Obama today in Paris was inexplicable. Over three million people march against Radical Islamic Terrorism. Wake up!
@FoxFriendsFirst @krauthammer Islamic Jihadism is here, zero political correctness. This is killing us!!. Allow mosque monitoring, 0 funding
@FoxFriendsFirst to Eric Holder: allow monitoring in the Mosques, stop all our funding to countries supporting terrorism 0 political correct
@JedediahBila 3.7 millions in the Paris protest against Islamic Jihad. Where is our president? More than 15 world leaders marching...
@JedediahBila yo le entendi. Como Latina me horrorizo ante la ausencia del presidente en la marcha :Je suis Charlie en Paris. Besos.
@Breaking911 Radical Islamic Terrorism is here: cut their funding, no internet recruiting sites, monitor all Mosques, 0 political correctn
RT @theblaze: Watch what cops do as Mayor Bill de Blasio walks into press conference on slain NYPD officers: http://t.co/87GTgt95sW http://‚Ä¶
Mayor  Di Blasio and Al Sharpton had provoked this by promoting black hatred against the police and whites. They have blood in their hands.
Two cops executed in Brooklyn by a man who wrote in Instagram that he was going to avenge the deaths of Michael Brown and Gardner.
@STOPTHIS   A lot of times if someone feels he or she is loosing in a conversation; they will revert to race even if it has no place in it.
@STOPTHIS AGREED!!!
@AtoFindata @DmiLlz516 @Azi @BilldeBlasio That sounds logical, but stats from the government are overwhelming in regards with blacks crime %
@AtoFindata @DmiLlz516 @Azi @BilldeBlasio The disproportionate crime rate among blacks have its on factors: teen pregnancy, gangs, brk fams
@AtoFindata @DmiLlz516 @Azi @BilldeBlasio I am not a racist. I am Latina with stats taken from http://t.co/IgEkRktFTU and the DOJ.
@AtoFindata @DmiLlz516 @Azi @BilldeBlasio Blacks are 24% of NYC  pop.,but they commited 68.5 % of all crime incl. robberies, stealings,rapes
@AtoFindata @DmiLlz516 @Azi @BilldeBlasio Blacks are 39 times more likely to commit a violent crime against whites than vice versa( DOJ stat
@AtoFindata @DmiLlz516 @Azi @BilldeBlasio According to first incarceration statistics 32% (blacks) 17% Hispanic	5.9% Whites. Stats don't lie
@AtoFindata @DmiLlz516 @Azi @BilldeBlasio The rate on black vs white rape is 50 to 1. Those statistics found at the DOJ are buried.
@EdnitaNazario Siempre te he admirado porque dices presente a m√∫ltiples causas ben√©ficas. Bravo, tienes un coraz√≥n de oro y una voz hermosa.
@EdnitaNazario Estoy100% de acuerdo.
@DmiLlz516 @Azi @BilldeBlasio I agree 100%. For issues like black on black violence resulting in over 89% of all deaths there are no marches
@Breaking911 I think that there are serious issues within the black &amp; Latino communities: violence, teen pregnancy, gangs, victimization...
@takeoutcreative I'd like to see a bigger march against black on black violence which accounts for over 89% of all deaths.  It is Past Due!!
We should all march against the rampant teen pregnancy in our black and Latino communities. This creates a culture of dependency &amp; poverty.
@STOPTHIS   We should really march against black on black violence that makes over 89% of all deaths in black communities. This is atrocious
Why don't we march against the gang problem in black and Latino communities? Why don't we protest against black on black violence &amp; death?
