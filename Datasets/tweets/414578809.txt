And today, @JulianCastro is showing young Latinos like me that our dreams are worth it. We may not be the front runners to many, but through the love of our familias and comunidades, hard work and perseverance, and big dreams we can achieve the #AmericanDream. #2020election 3/3
Many told me I could not work in politics because I did not come from a political family and no one from Hialeah can ever aspire to lead a life in service of others. My mom is a cafeteria worker in my elementary school. My dad is a truck driver turned longshoreman. 2/3
Growing up I was told by many that I couldn‚Äôt achieve my dream of going to @Harvard because my parents were Cuban immigrants who were not wealthy and could barely speak English. 1/3 https://t.co/Seb3SrKbwX
We need to be front and center in campaign leadership. Our voices need to be taken seriously. This is how we‚Äôll win. We cannot tokenize people of color. We need to be intentional. We need to give people a reason to vote, and Latinos will be a major part of this. 2/2
.@JulianCastro thank you! Again, if Dems want to beat Trump, we need to uplift the voices of women, people of color, queer people, people with disabilities, people with different religious beliefs, and folks whose identities exist at the intersection thereof. 1/2 https://t.co/v9q3k5utSP

@JayAlver James: Dems were supported by major political leaders in Puerto Rico, including Rosello, Melendez, and Yulin, regardless of where they stood on statehood. The issue with Puerto Rican outreach goes beyond statehood. Press releases were sent, and not much more happened.
FL Dems took the Latino community for granted and were not intentional with messaging. It was not dialectical, culturally competent, and far-reaching enough. If we want to win we must do better. I am tired of my community being overlooked. 4/4
Labor unions and other groups such as @FLImmigrant @NewFLMajority @seiufl @FaithFlorida @OrgFlorida @latinovictoryus worked hard to register, persuade, and mobilize Latino voters in Florida; however, the party did not do enough to amplify these efforts. 3/4
Cubans have become more willing to vote for Democrats in recent cycles and yet we wrote them off. FL Dems assumed Puerto Ricans would be the magical solution w/o articulating how we would help ameliorate the situation on the island and in Central Florida post-Hurricane Maria. 2/4
.@MikeGrunwald a number of Democratic Latino staffers in Florida voiced their concerns that the party &amp; statewide candidates were missing the mark on Latino outreach. It was non-existent! Scott &amp; DeSantis were relentless in their Latino outreach. FL Dems ignored Cuban voters. 1/4 https://t.co/LLuaus7BGj
@MikeGrunwald @MarcACaputo @MikeGrunwald many of us who were Latino staffers in Florida kept saying this and we were largely ignored
