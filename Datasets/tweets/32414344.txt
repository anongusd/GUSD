@ems1944 @RWPUSA BTW if you spend any time on Facebook I run a political discussion group there.  It would be interesting to have you join if you are interested.
@ems1944 @RWPUSA I responded referring to the 10 items in the pew study. You disagree with the conclusion that I draw so there‚Äôs not much more I can offer you other than to agree to disagree
@ems1944 @RWPUSA I understand your POV.  The thread of our conversation is similar to how they go with my conservative friends.  They also insist they haven‚Äôt moved to the right either.  Yet I sit in the middle swing both ends moving.
@ems1944 @RWPUSA On a purely subjective basis it is what it has ‚Äúfelt‚Äù like to me as well. For awhile when I found the Republicans too far right for me to support I could find. Democrat that I could. I don‚Äôt find that very often anymore.
@ems1944 @RWPUSA Well since you won‚Äôt accept the data in the Pew research as showing this using a consistent data set over a 20 year period I am not sure what else I can offer you. It is clear to me in that data. You draw a different conclusion.
@ems1944 @RWPUSA I would be interested in seeing whatever object of data make you believe in that movie because I don‚Äôt see it at all
@ems1944 @RWPUSA Irrespective of all of that you and I are pretty much in alignment with respect to the current state I believe
@ems1944 @RWPUSA In those 10 items the parties of move in opposite directions in the last 30 years
@ems1944 @RWPUSA It would seem to me that Pew does exactly what you said. They have 10 specific attributes that they used to measure the difference between conservative and liberal. It is a discrete set of 10 items. BTW I am not familiar with any agreed ‚Äòstandard‚Äô definition.  And ...
@ems1944 @RWPUSA Look more carefully at the graphs on pages 11-13. They clearly show both parties moving apart.  It is explicitly not a one party move.
@ems1944 @RWPUSA See the Pew report to see the shift on a number of positions
@ems1944 @RWPUSA Pages 11-13 is the most clear illustration but the entire report show the movement of both parties. https://t.co/or6iYBFbIk
@ems1944 @RWPUSA With respect to the GOP going off the rails I agree.  I just see the Dems having also moved as well.
@ems1944 @RWPUSA I will see if I can dig it up. Not at my computer though at the moment and the phone is a bit more difficult to navigate
@ems1944 @RWPUSA By definition I am using the respective parties platforms as their version of idealogical ‚Äòpurity‚Äô.  A centrist (moderate) in my definition isn‚Äôt aligned with either set, but picks and chooses or modifies from this platforms.
@ems1944 @RWPUSA There was some interesting Pew research that doesn‚Äôt comport with your assessment of the position of the Democratic Party but setting that aside the distance between the parties has increased I think we agree.
@ems1944 @RWPUSA Well an admittedly imprecise definition would be, given current climate would be someone that is not idea logically ‚Äúpure‚Äù. The distance between the parties seems greater now than any time in the past 30 years. Each has drift away from the center.
@ems1944 @RWPUSA I am not expressing a preference. I am making an observation based on campaign and election behavior.  How many moderates still exist in either party?   They are a vanishing breed. In the ideologically pure parties compromise is now a bad word.
@RWPUSA @ems1944 Neither party seems to be interested in fielding moderate candidates. In the Republican Party they get primaried from the right. In the Democratic Party they get primaried from the left.  Being pragmatic is now a political liability it seems

@abotforsure @Grakthis @Bankers100 @daveweigel @hughhewitt That goes without saying.  I am not a fan of either extreme myself.  I find it unfortunate that the choices offered seem to only be far left or right.  No sense of a higher obligation from either end
@abotforsure @Grakthis @Bankers100 @daveweigel @hughhewitt Perhaps they would. But at the same time the right leaning would likely believe the same thing.  There in lies a problem. Both sides actively politicizing the judiciary instead of governing.
@Grakthis @Bankers100 @abotforsure @daveweigel @hughhewitt Agreed and then the Dems stooped down to play at that level.  Consequently we see Democrats being primaried from the progressive side and we see Republicans being primaried from the tea party side. So both have retreated to their ideological corners.

@aqualad08 @Bankers100 @daveweigel @hughhewitt Perhaps you see it as a false equivalency but I see the problem as running much deeper.  I see little in the way of coherent leadership in either party today.  The entire process is deeply infected with the extremes from both sides owning the dialog now.
@Bankers100 @aqualad08 @daveweigel @hughhewitt My point was that neither party is living up to their obligation to govern.  They have retreated to their ideological corners and abandoned the country.  Both.
