Our work immediately begins today in Louisiana, North Carolina and Montana ‚Äì all of which are strong pick-up opportunities in 2019 and 2020.
Tuesday night was a very disappointing night for Democrats in the states, and they will have to contend with the fact that the RGA will likely increase its total to 30 or more governors over the next two years.
Republicans re-elected 11 of our 13 incumbents, won the majority of the open seat races we were defending, and won a majority of the states up for election where the governor has an impact on redistricting.
Republicans won the night‚Äôs biggest prizes in Florida and Ohio, flipped Alaska to GOP control, and held the line against the ‚Äòblue wave‚Äô that the Democrats assured everyone was coming.
Despite their boasts and guarantees of picking up 10-12 governorships, Democrats failed to capitalize on their extremely favorable map, and Republicans will still hold a strong majority of governorships in 2019. https://t.co/lGYAJpHafG
