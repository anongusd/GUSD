@ConradAppel by your logic he either gets blame for the bad economy or Obama gets credit for good nat‚Äôl economy. You take credit for good news &amp; blame an opponent for bad news. BTW, what specific measures have YOU taken in the last 10 years to improve La.‚Äôs economy? Bloviating doesn‚Äôt count.
@ConradAppel Deflection is not an answer. And don‚Äôt put words in my mouth and don‚Äôt you dare try to put hate in my heart. I don‚Äôt hate Jindal. YOU brought him into this, I didn‚Äôt. You credited him with this week‚Äôs good news. Yet you say our economy sucks. All I said was...

@ConradAppel Again you misquote. Read my profile, Conrad. It says ‚ÄúRTs not endorsements.‚Äù Is there something unclear there???
@ConradAppel Furthermore, you claim to want levelheaded discussion, yet you frame the debate in all-or-nothing terms: either everyone gets any guns they want or no one gets any guns. Follow your own admonition and be level headed. There‚Äôs room for the 2nd Amendment AND real gun safety.

@ConradAppel $1B was state general fund, not federal. Look it up. No economic growth comes from bad tax policies among other things.
@ConradAppel Status quo in '08 was $1B surplus. After 8 yrs of Jindal &amp; GOP control it's $2B structural deficit.
@ConradAppel For past 9 years "status quo" is structural deficits created/exacerbated by Jindal &amp; GOP-controlled LaLege.
@ConradAppel When, exactly, did you ever see me advocate status quo or say things can't be better?

#solvethebudget Winham: reason we don't use state property tax is because prop tax rolls riddled with unequal assessments
#solvethebudget Richardson: only long term solution is tax reform that leads to stability &amp; predictability
#solvethebudget Richardson: when oil prices go back up Lege will spend it or reduce taxes again, putting us back where we are today
#solvethebudget Winham: drop in oil prices not as impactful today as decades ago, when it was 40% of La budget. Now only 10%
#solvethebudget Winham: Needs to simplify the tax code.
#solvethebudget Winham: Those ideas would generate $2 billion. Also raise gasoline tax to fix roads &amp; bridges
#solvethebudget Winham: Reinstitute Stelly, repeal fracking exmptn, reverse biz tax breaks, eliminate enterprise zones, tax biz utilities.
@Henders20Mike Ya think?
#solvethebudget Prof Davis: one thing that shd keep La's best here is high cost of out-of-state tuition at other states' schools.
#solvethebudget TOPS still dominating questions from students &amp; audience.
RT @Henders20Mike: #solvethebudget Dr Davis plugs some blog called LA By The Numbers. Sounds interesting. I should check that out:  https:/‚Ä¶
#solvethebudget Prof Davis: people don't realize most "welfare fraud" committed by doctors &amp; providers, not individuals. Moller agrees.
@tuppydougherty #solvethebudget Helping poor kids go to college was Pat Taylor's original idea w/TOPS. It evolved into broad entitlement
#solvethebudget Prof Davis: folks say no taxes, but choices clouded when faced with painful cuts. LSU poll out soon on that question.
#solvethebudget Winham: people starting to realize that structural deficit is real, but many still just want spending cuts.
#solvethebudget Winham: If leges just pass sales tax it's kicking can further down the road. Many still think we just have spending prob.
#solvethebudget  Typo: La should FUND higher education properly
#solvethebudget Richardson: If we don't adequately finder higher ed and give excellent product, best &amp; brightest shd go elsewhere.
@Henders20Mike #solvethebudget  Lol
#solvethebudget Student query: What do say to students who use TOPS to stay in La. as best &amp; brightest? Russell: La hasn't tracked that.
#solvethebudget Moller: TOPS may be too costly but traditional aid program for needy students is too underfunded.
#solvethebudget Correction: In last tweet, that student was actually Prof Davis. Sorry about that.
#solvethebudget Winham: TOPS GPS threshold is too low. Student: Remember why TOPS was created, to help kids who might not go to college
#solvethebudget Kirkpatrick: Best to make tough tax votes now to give folks time to get over it. Richardson agrees.
#solvethebudget Richardson: Inventory tax convolution is great example of La's bad tax policy.
#solvethebudget Richardson: Film tax credit last year cost $250 million. "That's more than we (LSU) get."
#solvethebudget Lobbyist Kirkpatrick: Biz looking for "some efficiencies" but often changes have domino effect.
#solvethebudget  Prof Davis: contracts politically good when called "privatization" but bad when called "contracts" in tough times.
#solvethebudget Richardson: Kennedy wd not talk like he does if he were guv.
#solvethebudget Richardson: contracts make fiscal sense cuz otherwise would need MUCH bigger state payroll.
#solvethebudget Moller: the cuts-only approach done by Jindal. Very little left. Could lose hospital operating companies.
#solvethebudget Moller: A "major fantasy" to think cutting contracts will solve budget crisis. All panelists agree.
#solvethebudget Question from student: Is Kennedy right about "spending problem"?
#solvethebudget Although groceries not taxed by state, folks using SNAP don't pay sales taxes anyway.
#solvethebudget Richardson: Too many exemptions are sacred politically, but fewer is better for overall tax policy.
#solvethebudget Richardson: eliminating exemptions is better policy overall, would lead to lower tax RATES, which is the goal.
#solvethebudget Winham: Eliminating some exemptions could generate many millions, especially certain biz exemptions like utility bills
#solvethebudget Richardson: Pols like sales tax cuz it's not as "emotional" as income tax. Biz "ought to come to its senses" on tax policy
#solvethebudget Richardson: Sales &amp; income taxes are only ones that make big impact.
#solvethebudget Moller: Proposed second additional penny in sales tax is horrible &amp; very harmful to individuals. Biz shd pay more.
#solvethebudget Moller: Stelly rollback by Jindal did most damage to budget over his 8 years.
#solvethebudget Winham: La has not had a truly balanced budget in 8 years (under Jindal)
#solvethebudget  Winham giving excellent recap of La's long history of budget probe. Stelly Plan was "most progressive" move ever.
#solvethebudget Prof Davis: too much reliance on regressive sales tax already in La, now going to get worse.
#solvethebudget Richardson &amp; Moller: very likely there will be another special session this year to deal w/long term structural problems.
#solvethebudget Moller: Lege letting a good crisis go to waste by doing minimal reforms. Focus is on this year, not long term.
#solvethebudget  Richardson: wd be "very surprised" if current special session solves the long term problem.
#solvethebudget Richardson gives the big picture: nobody shd be surprised at La budget crisis, yet "almost impossible" to fix it.

Guv forum hosted by La. Farm Bureau Federation. Moderator Jim Engster and I will discuss on his radio show at 4PM.
Angelle gives Jindal C- on other fronts. Vitter sez only that he wd give Jindal "less" than that.
Dardenne grades Jindal B- on 1st term, D since. Edwards gives him F for gutting higher Ed, drawing applause from crowd.
Angelle gives Jindal B+ for econ dev, school choice, workforce dev. Vitter agrees on B+ but gives 'less' elsewhere.
All 4 La. guv candidates also say they want to protect churches from having to perform weddings against their beliefs.
At La. guv forum, all 4 candidates disagree w.SCOTUS decision in same sec marriage but all agree issue now settled.

Bobby Jindal's brain is a "no-go zone" for truth, logic, sincerity, integrity, intelligence.
RT @FamesJallows: I bet Bobby Jindal's brain spends a lot of time questioning the purpose it serves in his body.
Speaking of no-go zones, is Jindal aware Native Americans have their own sovereignty, laws, courts &amp; police‚Äîhere in U.S.?
Bobby Jindal couldn't name a single UK neighborhood that is a no-go zone, or even speak to Muslim assimilation in La.
Jindal did not answer a single question from CNN's Blitzer, who failed to follow up on any of Jindal's non-answers.

Still more military/mail ballots from East Coast to arrive Wed afternoon, counted Saturday. For whom the ballot tolls? Dunno!
Um...more ballots from military, emails &amp; absentee (as opposed to early voting) -- and guess what? Tolls now pass by 8 votes!
Overall, a bad night for the courthouse crowds on the West Bank.
Three Orleans school bd incumbents lose: Bonin, Robichaux, Moran. Absentee votes gave Moran foe Ellison her margin.

Never a recession in LA politics ‚Äî my Top 10 Political Stories of 2011. http://t.co/1LTLdDq9
The BEST post-election myth-busting on Bobby Jindal yet. With I'd written it. http://t.co/TvBs2aCz
#BPCNOLA Hooever: Millennial generation doesn't buy Reagan idea that govt is the problem. Conserv challenge is finding way to reach them.
#BPCNOLA Hoover: GOP needs to talk about issues and be pragmatic, not idealistic. "Generational theft" of Soc Security shd be a big issue.
#BPCNOLA Meg Hoover: Millennials have trended Dems since 2004. If GOP doesn't make inroads in 2012, it'll lose that generation forever.
#BPCNOLA Post-lunch panel discussing demographic changes & race for 2012. "Millennial" generation is largest yet - bigger than boomers.
#BPCNOLA Bennett: if 2012 is referendum on O, he will lose. Dems should hope for Bachmann or someone who can be cast as unacceptable choice.
#BPCNOLA Bennett: Traditional campaign modes "didn't matter" in 2010. 2012 will show real strength of social media in politics.
#BPCNOLA Frmr Sen Bennett: 2010 elexn "was a scream." Angry voters "wanted to send a message." Money didn't matter. Social media prevailed.
#BPCNOLA Hughes: Presidency getting more challenging, esp in light of public's and media's demands for minute-by-minute info.
#BPCNOLA Wolfe: One of the myths of the presidency is that prezes don't change. They always change, as do relationships, events, etc.
#BPCNOLA Karen Hughes: "There's no constituency for doing the right thing." E.G., those who voted for TARP and were later sacked.
#BPCNOLA Peter Fenn, disagreeing with Bennett: Obama has been "amazingly successful" ‚Äî health care reform, foreign policy.
#BPCNOLA Bennett:  Obama's one fundamental mistake: he's badly over-exposed. "He's Eddie Murphy. ... too many bad movies." Big laugh.
#BPCNOLA Sen. Bob Bennett: If you measure success by passing bills, O's a success. If you measure by problems solved, he's a failure.
#BPCNOLA Wolfe: "If you don't get communications right, you won't get your policy right."
#BPCNOLA Richard Wolfe: Obama's "change" was mostly about process, not as much about policy. My comment: That's the problem; no folo-thru.
#BPCNOLA Karen Hughes: "There is a yearning" among Americans for consensus building.
#BPCNOLA "War Stories" panel just starting. Shd be really interesting. 1st query: Rate Obama as a campaigner vs as a Prez.
#BPCNOLA Matalin: I have one daughter who's a lib, one who's a conserv, it will be the next generation that solves it.
#BPCNOLA First session was excellent. Lingering question: How do we steer America ‚Äî esp. its leaders ‚Äî to the center?
#BPCNOLA Lott clarifies: The generation that came up in the '60s & '70s is "carrying a lot of baggage." People want results/cooperation.
#BPCNOLA Trent Lott: The real problem is not institutional or rules. "The problem is us. ... Elected officials and our generation."
#BPCNOLA Will it take a 3rd political party to break the deadlock in DC? Probably not happening, but "none of the above" would win in '12.
#BPCNOLA At the Bipartisan Policy Summit at Tulane. Former Mississippi Sen. Trent Lott says, "I'm for Romney ... because he can win."
