@jeff_gluck I think the winner for Daytona needs to be corrected unless it is the 1st stage winner.
@jeff_gluck 2 of 2 The racing this weekend was typical Daytona. The only difference was that wrecked cars could not come back on the track.
@jeff_gluck 1 of 2 - I think you cannot truly judge the effects of stage racing until they race at non-restrict or tracks.
