Thank you @JohnCornyn for stopping the 2019 Medicare Health Insurance Tax and lowering Medicare Advantage Premiums. Now it's time to stop the 2020 Medicare Health Insurance Tax. #NoMedicare2020HIT
On #VeteransDay, let’s celebrate everyone who served, but most importantly the people in our lives who took the oath. Here’s how. #HonorThroughAction
Ted Cruz fought to cut my taxes. @BetoORourke voted to RAISE my taxes. That's why I’m voting for @tedcruz for #TXSen! #ChooseCruz #KeepTexasRed https://t.co/ZK2HyAZ6cg
I choose @tedcruz for @TXSen because facts are stubborn things for @betoorourke. In the #TexasDebate, Beto claimed he didn’t vote in favor of a $10-a-barrel tax on oil, but the record shows he did… #ChooseCruz
I #ChooseCruz because the records of Congressman @betoorourke and @tedcruz could not be more different. WATCH and RETWEET! #TexasDebate #TXSen #KeepTexasRed DONATE to help Ted #CruzToVictory: https://t.co/VXWuL81o6m
I'm proud to support @tedcruz for #TXSen because he has the support of the National Border Patrol Council and he will secure our borders! #TexasDebate
I choose @tedcruz for #TXSen because he defended #2A! #ChooseCruz #TXSenateDebate #KeepTexasRed
I choose @tedcruz for #TXSen because Ted is leading the fight for Texas, for jobs, for wages, and for the Texas oil and gas industry! @BetoORourke is wrong on energy and wrong for Texas! #ChooseCruz #KeepTexasRed
After 15 years of prohibition, I’d kick things off with a #RepealedManhattan made with #BeamRepealBatch. Which @JimBeam cocktail would you choose?
#NationalDrinkBeerDay #Choose Crux.@POTUS signed @TedCruz’s 33rd legislative measure into law! I #ChooseCruz for #TXSen because he fights for and delivers on behalf of 28 million Texans. #KeepTexasRed

@IngrahamAngle @SenKamalaHarris Pretty desperate. Never heard of a robber say "hope u give me your wallet".  No comparison!
RT @IngrahamAngle: Desperate Kamala: @SenKamalaHarris compares Trump "hope" that Flynn investigation wd conclude to robber "putting gun to…
@BarbieMnyc @nytimes No way!  Why don't you go to China for the next 3 years and breathe their air?  Or stay there 30 years until they get their air in order
@brithume No. Time our Congress gets back to work and stop investigating NOTHING!
