@IngrahamAngle Dems are prolonging. stalling, and down right ignorant. Causing a world crisis, and poverty to the American people. Lacking resource for everyone including myself.	www.usshutdown2019 .simplesite.com https://t.co/nuT37C7kBH
Democrats are ignorant, fullish, and down right stupid. They are not helping our country, nor the American people. Dems are just creating a world crisis, and prolonging devastation. Make a Deal and get over it.
