@DeplorableChoir That‚Äôs because journalists have an education.
@gabrielmalor Let me ask you all a question, what exactly do you believe the Supreme Court is suppose to represent and embody in America. It is not only the laws of the land, but the moral soul of America. Thus any that represent it should be beyond reproach, Kavanaugh is clearly not.
@dbongino @FrankelJeremy Why is she there in the first place? Consider that.

@FirstManMovie This is more American than ur hatred is, you people have no respect for the very thing you vainly choose to defend. Look through your history you fools. This is how we beat back communism with the best of America, it‚Äôs how we inspired the world to be better. Grow up.

@gabrielmalor One thing it‚Äôs perfectly reasonable to believe a professor at university is telling the truth because she has nothing to loose, and perfectly reasonable to assume Kavanaugh is lying because he has everything to loose.

@realDonaldTrump It‚Äôs funny how trump supporters think they‚Äôre making America great again, when most of them are retired or our working mostly routine maintenance jobs. I wonder who actually pushes new ideas and industries in this country?

@SmashRacismDC I appreciate the anger and the resolve of these protesters, but this was simply not a wise move politically speaking. Please think before you act, you only gave conservatives what they wanted and more than likely hurt Beto.
