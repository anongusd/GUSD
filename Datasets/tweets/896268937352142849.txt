libertarians are also the biggest fucking billionaire bootlickers in the world. they think if they work hard enough the corporate machine will give them a slice of their wealth. DELUSIONAL!
MUH FACTS AND LOGIC. libertarians are the most pretentious fucking political affiliation in goddamn world. you base just as many of your decisions on emotion just your emotionally based decisions are for self preservation and preserving the imagined wealth you think you have.

correct me if im wrong though, id love to see an accurate stat on the matter.
under representation of non caucasians is still a real problem. africans make up 12 percent of the us population. do 12 percent of films have a black lead? im not sure, but i feel like its probably in the 3-5 percent range.
baltimo should be a majority african its all about context that doesnt mean africans should just not be reppd in places where they are a minority. its up to individuals to represent themselves in whatever arts they create, same goes for any country that has a non white majority.
but it's an inevitable that the demographic that is the majority of any country will be the most represented in that country's media/arts. now if we were talking about an individual city such as baltimore where africans make up a majority of the population. media representing
getting upset over under representation of african americans is understandable but a little silly. considering people of african descent are still a minority of the us population its obvious they will be represented less than caucasians. im all for african, asian, native, rep
whether its 90% men 10% women, 50/50, or 90% women 10% men should not matter. everyone should have the right to dehumanize themselves for governmental profits.
i also do not agree with military standards being lowered for women. (i don't agree with having a military at all but thats irrelevant) standards should be set and if those standards arent met then so be it, but that doesnt mean excluding women or men for that matter.
not monolithic entities, they are individuals, but just as a woman can be stronger than a man and vice versa, it's all relative and there's so many variables that the idea of exclusion of other genders as a blanket statement is counter intuitive
"UHH THERE'S PHYSICAL DIFFERENCES BETWEEN MEN AND WOMEN" no shit theres physical differences between every person. physical differences vary on an individual basis. the fact that men on average have stronger builds than women should be irrelevant considering. men and women are
