@GMA @VanityFair Bette Midler Moray beautiful dress as she was singing. I wish that these fashion designers would bring color into fashion instead of the always boring colors that are out there and beautiful designs again.
@EdKrassen @realDonaldTrump Ed Krassenstein, we have a National Emergency. We the United States can not afford to take on or support other countries.  The United States has homeless and sick people and they can not afford health care, food or houses. 1st, Take care of the United States and its people.
President Trump,  thank you for Declaring A National Emergency to Fund the Border Wall.  We Americans want that Boader Wall.
@realDonaldTrump President Trump, don't cave you stand strong and get the American people that Border Wall we want and eleceted you for. Build that Border Wall. Executive Decision. Build That Wall. Make that decision. Stand strong and tuff.
Blame that on Kenneth Stokes. The death rate that he cannot control in his Capital City Jackson Mississippi. https://t.co/7wkmKePJcs
@AnnCoulter Ann Coulter,  we the Americans want that wall. We voted for President Trump for that reason.  Build that Wall or shut it down again.. President Trump stay tuff.. Build that Wall and keep the American people safe.

Gayle King, with due respect.  If someone does something as a Halloween costume doesn't mean they are racist and should not be fired from their job 40 to 50 years later. Unless they are committing a crime. What about those who dress in white face??? https://t.co/YRzVg775iy
@PhilBryantMS I am proud of Gov. Phil Bryant.  We want that wall. Now let's talk about the Confederate Flag.  For those who are ignorant of the history. The Confederate flag was designed 29 years after that war. No one tells you the true history of that flag.
@skyhighforkids Grace, I am so proud of you.  I will pray for you that the cancer never comes back and you will stay in remission. May God lay his healing hands upon you and keep you cancer free. Both of my parents had cancer so I do understand. God bless you young lady.
Stacey Abrams, I think it is horrible that people have to bring race into everything. There is over 20 all black Schools 3 black colleges and Ms Black America and not one Caucasian in any of those. Now that's racism. If Caucasians had an all-white School you would say racism. https://t.co/yVhd1hTNPI
@PhilBryantMS I wish that people would study their history before they start talking about things that they do not fully know about or have studied the about. A flag or monument is not racist people are racist. Why is it that some monuments are taken down history erased and others not.
@PhilBryantMS When people talk about the Confederate flag it shows their ignorance. The Confederate flag was not designed until 29 years after the Confederate War. The Confederate flag was not flown during the Confederate War. There were many designs for the flag but all were turned down.
Rep.Chris Bell. If people knew there history about the Confederate flag they would know it was not flown during the Confederate War. That flag was not designed until 29 years after the Confederate War. The American flag was flown during the war. Many designs were not approved. https://t.co/wrAukGa2ag
Adam doesn't have to comment. He is there to perform. The football players should stand for the American Flag. If the players want to make a change let them teach the community's none violence and to stop killing each other.  Don't disrespect American Flag... https://t.co/t69KIXAdSD

@realDonaldTrump Amen. It is time to have Bible back in school.. reposting..
@realDonaldTrump Amen. It is time to have bible back in s6.
@PhilBryantMS Democrats need to think about someone besides themselves and think about the American people.  Americans need that Boader Wall and we want it. Keep us safe and think about the American people for a change.  Democrats, get off your high horse!!!
@PhilBryantMS Phil Bryant for President.
Bennie Thompson needs to stop the crime in the Capital of Mississippi. That alone shows that you that he needs to find another job because Bennie Thompson can not manage his own City. Shame on you. Find another job. https://t.co/oqpQgIED3b

@PhilBryantMS My one wish for Governor Phil Bryant is to get extremely tough on the crime in the capital of Jackson Mississippi. It's outrageous that every other County has gotten a control on their crime but Jackson leaders cannot control their people. That is not leadership. Pathetic.
@realDonaldTrump President Trump, please do not give illegal immigrants a social security number.They have not worked to add to the retirement.  It is not fair to the American people who have worked all their lives for social security. Stop giving it to them free, it's Americans money.
@realDonaldTrump Nancy Pelosi is now holding the government hostage.  We need that Boader Wall and the Military at our Borders. That is what Trump campaigned for a border wall. America voted him in for that reason. Nancy Pelosi, stop being a pain in America's, backside.
@realDonaldTrump @WhiteHouse If I were President I would have closed the Border along time ago when it started. I would have made an executive order the have the wall built that way the citizens of America could work and get paid. God bless everyone and stay strong.
@realDonaldTrump @WhiteHouse President Trump,  please close the Boarder. Make an executive order to Build the Border Wall. People need to get paid. Thank you and have a blessed day. We need that Boader Wall. Stay strong. You are doing a fantastic job.
@PhilBryantMS As of now 86 people have been killed in Jackson Mississippi all black on black crime. Why aren't the parents and the people in this area speaking to their loved ones and checking their rooms and taking away guns? Law Enforcement is needed. Disgraceful.
@PhilBryantMS Parents need to step up and start teaching their children and teaching them to have some morals. Teach them to Stop killing each other. Stop blaming others for your down falls.  Parents take responsibility teach your children if you love them. Stop blaming others.
@PhilBryantMS Governor Phil Bryant has done a fantastic job. He has fought to bring businesses to his state. Governor Bryant and his wife the first lady are fine Christian people. Thank you Governor for serving the state of Mississippi. We need you in Washington now. God bless you.

@donlemon We need to close the Boarder Wall. We can't afford them, feed,or give health care. We have American people who can't get the Healthcare they need. We have Americans on the streets starving. America struggles. Immigration Executive Order. Will solve it
@realDonaldTrump We need to take free education out of prisons . Prisoners need to pay for their own education.  Give that Free education to people who have never committed a crime. Stop rewarding criminals. Prisoners need to pay back when they get out or their family needs to pay it.
@realDonaldTrump We need to be able to send our children to college free or the fee lowered to almost nothing.  We The People do not want to have to take care of other countries. We the Americans struggle to educate our children and people go bankrupt doing so.
@realDonaldTrump President Trump we stand beside you on this matter. We elected you for this Border Wall. We can't afford to feed them. We can't feed or house our homeless Americans. It is fair to have 2 educate other countries people.  We need to give free education to Americans.
Rashida Tlaib, your actions are a Disgrace because people around the world are watching. You should have higher standards as a female. You can still be a strong woman with bad language. You need God in your life. Go to church. https://t.co/dojCZqnh0g
Rashida Tlaib, what kind of morals are you teaching your child? If you act like you have no sense in public. How immoral do you act at home?????? As a female you should have higher standards for your self in day and age.
@NewDay She is a disgrace to that office and to this country. Intelligent people don't have to use profanity. People that hold an office position should have extremely high morals and integrity. Unfortunately we now have immoral people going into these offices. Shameful
@realDonaldTrump President Trump, We the People are asking you to make that Executive Decision to Build the Wall. You have the Authority to make an Executive Decision. Just make the executive decision. Stop the American people from suffering..
@realDonaldTrump My Fellow Americans, we have American Soldiers, People Living on the streets here in America. We can't afford any one that comes here that can't support themselves. We can't afford them. Until we have all Americans off the streets in a home with health care. Border Wall.
@realDonaldTrump For those who keep saying hire more guards they can't be every where.  If that is the case We need our thousands of Military protecting the Border. What would you say if your loved one was killed by a criminal illegal immigrant.??  We need a Border Wall.
@realDonaldTrump President Trump,  if you can make an executive order to build the wall please do it at this time. We the people are asking you to do that. The people of the United States need to get paid they have children, bills. Executive Order. Border Wall. Thank you
@buzzman888 @IlhanMN America wants the Border Wall.  Build the Border Wall.  Keep us safe. You have security guards and a security wall around your estates. We want that Boader Wall.  If you care about Americans then protects us. Build the Border Wall.
@TeaBoots Congress woman, your actions were a disgrace and a disappointment to women.  You are supposed to be an Educated woman and it is time you acted like you have some common sense. Educated people do not have to use bad language.
@SenWarren Stop giving the money Americans worked so hard for too people who have never worked in the USA. You will bankrupt us. President Trump, do not give in keep us safe.
@SenWarren Close the Boarder and Build the Border Wall  you keep your family safe with body guards and security gates around your estate. We can't afford them. We worked hard for our retirement savings. Immigrants will bankrupt the USA. It's time to take care of Americans 1st.
@SenWarren Senator,  if you want to serve and protect this country and commonwealth. You will Build the Border Wall. Illegal immigrants are coming to the United States and Murdering our families. If it were your family you would Build The Border Wall. Keep us Safe. It's time..
@SpeakerPelosi Close that Border and keep us and our next generation safe. The people of the United States did not work all of our lives for illegal immigrants who have never worked in this country to steal our social security and make us bankrupt. We can't afford them. Send them home.
@SpeakerPelosi Every one has the same opportunity to vote. Just show your ID. You have to have it for every thing else. President Trump stay strong on that Border Wall.  We want that Boader Wall to keep us Americans safe from illegal immigrants who murder our families. Protect us. It's time.
@SpeakerPelosi Protect our children that is common sense. Your families are not being murdered ours are. Close That Border and Build Border Wall.
@RepJeffries Build the Border Wall and keep the American People safe.  American people are getting killed because your House will not Build the Border Wall. If your family were the victim's you would build the wall to keep them safe. You have security and walls around your estate
@HouseDemocrats We The People want that Boader Wall. Build the Border Wall and keep America safe. The American people deserve to be kept safe. Illegal aliens are entering the country and killing our American citizens. Your families are safe keep ours safe build the wall.
@SpeakerPelosi You would Build That Wall if one of those murdered victims were one of your family members. If an illegal alien killed your family members, children on that stage You Build That Wall to protect them. What about our families? What about the murder victims families?
@SpeakerPelosi If you really cared about the people. You would build back that wall and keep us safe. You can stop this by funding the wall. Enough Americans have been killed by illegal aliens. You need to protect the American people by building that wall. Your fault.
@SpeakerPelosi Rep.Nancy Pelosi, We the People want that Boader Wall. Build that Border Wall. Protect our Country anything else will be an injustice to the United States of America. You have security guards and a wall around your estate. It is time to Protect us.

@RyanAFournier @2getherweMAGA Since these Countries are so bad I think our President Trump should band all Americans from going to those countries.
@RyanAFournier @2getherweMAGA We the people want that Boader Wall and close that Border until everything's under control.
@RyanAFournier @2getherweMAGA Mimi, this Land was not free. It casts a lot of peoples lives. People need to legally come in any country. We can't take on entire countries coming in here. We can't Afford them. It is sad. We have Millions Living on the streets.

@1Kevin_T @SenSchumer @realDonaldTrump The question is. If one of those criminals came here and killed one of your family members how fast would you Build That Wall? You have security people protecting you and your family. Are you going to pay individual security to protect us? Build walls around our homes?
@1Kevin_T @SenSchumer @realDonaldTrump It is shameful you're going to land other people from other countries come to America well we have homeless starving people children and military people on our streets. It's been verified that criminals are coming over killing our people and our police officers.
@1Kevin_T @SenSchumer @realDonaldTrump Sen Charles Schumer, Build that Border Wall and protect this United States of America.  Shut that Boader Down. American can not afford them. We have Millions on Millions of American people homeless Living on the streets along with homeless military. Shameful

@MikeHersh @SenWarren Mike we have different views but in saying that I hope that we can at least be friends.
@MikeHersh @SenWarren Those countries government should get a back bone and Stop the violence in their countries. People think they can come to America and get a free ride. Cross the border have a baby get free ssi when they get older. It's time to stop. We can't go to those countries and do that.
@MikeHersh @SenWarren We have in America homeless people which includes Veterans and children that are starving and has no health insurance. Many sufferers from mental health disorders and can not afford health care for mental illnesses.
@MikeHersh @SenWarren Yes Trump's wall will help. Seeking asylum is legal. Mike, tell me are you going to pay for their housing, insurance, food? No you are not.  We Americans can't afford them. America middle class can not afford health insurance and barely food for there families.
@MikeHersh @SenWarren What about the crime in the United States of America? We can't afford to support anyone else. We have crime here.
@MikeHersh @SenWarren Think rationally about this. We have millions of people including military people living on the streets. Our government cannot afford to house them. Where do they think they're going to live, housing, food, Medical Care. The Americans can't afford these things.
@MikeHersh @SenWarren Mike, we work with the homeless and we also work with females that have been sold and abused in the sex trade. 1 from Columbia 1 from Peru 1 from Mexico. All druged and sold into sex slave. We've got them out of that. All brought here to America.
@SenWarren @MikeHersh With all due respect, you are crazy.  We need that Boader Wall. We the people want that Wall. We have American people Living on the streets. We have American people hungry and no health insurance.  We can't afford illegal immigrants.
@SenWarren It is sad this happened to this innocent child.  His father did refuse medical attention when asked. People don't realize what illnesses that people and children may be bringing with them.  Have they had all there vaccinations and their countries?
For 2019, I hope … #HappyNewYear #2019Hopes Build The Border Wall https://t.co/dRJq8vRKaM

@realDonaldTrump Democrats have fences and Walls around their homes already protecting their families. We don't have security guards or police protecting our families individually like you do. It's time to Protect us, We the American People. Build that Wall.
@realDonaldTrump Build that Wall. We the People want that Wall.
@realDonaldTrump Democrats, Build that Wall. You have guards protecting your family we the people do not have any protection. You already live behind a guarded wall, We the People do not. Build the Wall or We the People will vote You Out next time.

#Lawenforcement Honoring our Law Enforcement. 3 killed in Mississippi 7 shot 1 killed in South Carolina. America what is wrong with these people.There should be a New Law. If you shoot and kill law enforcement you should get the death penalty. Stop The Violence.
#officerjameswhite Rest in peace two heroes September 29, 2018. May God be with their families. Crying my eyes out. These two officers were killed by a criminal who should have been in jail. How will we be remembered. (As he stated ) Stop the violence.
#GirlChat Ladies, more crime occurs at night. More women get raped, murdered, kidnapped and sold into slavery during the hours of the night. They do this during the night so they are not supposedly scene. More crime happens at night. Ladies take caution. Love your show.
@SenWarren Give Brett Kavanaugh a Polygraph Test.  He said, that it will not be admissible in court.  That's a legal term.  Only the guilty would say that. Brett Kavanaugh what want be admissible in court? The truth or the dishonesty. Why are you afraid of the polygraph test??
@SenWarren Sens Warren, we the American people ask for Brett Kavanaugh to be given a POLYGRAPH TEST. That will clear this matter up. Brett said, "It is not admissible in court." That's a Legknal term. Only a guilty person would say that.  ( my all Capitol letters are not yelling.)m
@LindseyGrahamSC Let's move on from the leaked letters from Miss Ford. Now let's clear the matter up. What is wrong about giving Kavanaugh a POLYGRAPH TEST. Kavanaugh should take a POLYGRAPH TEST. Brett said, it is not admissible in court. Only a guilty person would say that. Legal terms

@krassenstein @LindaBo81465460 Give Brett Kavanaugh a Polygraph Test. He is being deceitful. An innocent person would say give me a Polygraph Test. The United States of America asks and demands him to take a Polygraph Test. He said, "a polygraph Test is not admissible in court." That shows deceit.
@Heritage Kavanaugh needs to take a Polygraph Test. KAVANAUGH, said, "the polygraph Test is not admissible in court. Legal term that mean he is guilty and hiding something. He is afraid of the Polygraph Test. Innocent people takes the Polygraph Tests.
@CoryBooker It's difficult for females to stand up and say something about sexual harassmen. It happened to me and I reported it.They told me if I made an issue out of it, I would be Fired from my job. I found out he was doing the same thing to other females. The man was not Fired.
@JeffFlake JeffFlake, please give Brett Kavanaugh a Polygraph Test. His response was. He said, "it is not admissible in court." That's legal talk. The Polygraph Test will prove His innocence or Guilt. His is Guilty. He is refusing to take Polygraph test. Make him take it.
@LindaHaleRCSD @funder Give Kavanaugh a polygraph Test to prove his innocence.  He doesn't want the polygraph Test. Brett said, it's not admissible in court.  He is hiding something. It will prove his innocence or Guilt.  Make Brett take the Polygraph Test.  President Trump.   Please.
@CoryBooker We the people of the United States of America are asking or demanding for Brett Kavanaugh to be given a Polygraph Test. Brett said,"it is not admissible in court.That shows he knows his legal terms for deceit. Even if he admits the crime he cannot be charge for the crime. Guilty
@charliekirk11 @rentonMagaUK Give Brett Kavanaugh a Polygraph Test. That will prove his innocence or Guilt. Brett Kavanaugh said, "It would not be admissible in Court. In order words he is Guilty.

@RockSolidLeader Thank you for following me.  God bless you.
@margaret_sc Thank you for following me.  God bless you.
@BrendaK73170006 Thank you for following me.  God bless you.
@RepMattGaetz Please give Brett Kavanaugh a Polygraph Test.  Please We The People of the United States beg of you. Kavanaugh said, "It would not be admissible in Court. He is guilty because only a guilty person would say that in that way.
@coldren_nicole @LindseyGrahamSC Give Kavanaugh a Polygraph Test. Kavanaugh said, "it is not admissible in Court.  Only the guilty says that....
@LindseyGrahamSC Give Brett Kavanaugh a Polygraph Test.
@SenWarren SenWarren, I ask that Brett Kavanaugh is giving a polygraph Test to clear this matter up. Kavanaugh said, "a polygraph Test is not admissible in court. Too many of us that shows a sign of guilt. Please give him a lie detector test. From: We the people of the United States.
@MaryFirme @LindseyGrahamSC He is there because a man with no morals who thinks putting their hands up women's skirts feeling their private parts is normal. So why do people think that because The people who the president suggest has no morals anymore he does.
@LindseyGrahamSC Give Kavanaugh a lie detector Test.  Not, lot of. I wish Twitter had correct opinions when a person uses voice command.
@LindseyGrahamSC To the men in Congress. If that were your child wouldn't you want the truth to find out what really happened? Give him a lot of tector test. Give him a lot of tector test. We the people want a lie detector test. Give him a lot of tector test.
@LindseyGrahamSC Kavanaugh did not want to take a polygraph Test because he is Not innocent. Kavanaugh said, "it is Not admissible in court.  Only a Guilty person says that. An innocent person would say give them a polygraph Test.  Kavanaugh is guilty and hiding the truth from the people. Guilty.
@LindseyGrahamSC Kavanaugh did not want to take a polygraph Test because he is Nit innocent.  Kavanaugh said, "it is not admissible in court. Only a Guilty person says that. An innocent person would say give them a polygraph Test.. Kavanaugh is guilty and hiding the truth from the people.
@TomShillueShow @JeffFlake @tomshillue @jimmyfailla @PlanetTyrus Do the FBI investigation and also give Brett Kavanaugh a Lie Detector Test. If Kavanaugh is innocent he would have told them to administer the Lie Detector Test to clear his name. No, he said that it is not admissible in court. Kavanaugh is guilty.
@TomShillueShow Tom, you know that Kavanaugh is not innocent when he doesn't want to take a polygraph test. Kavanaugh is Guilty!! So is his friend when he goes and hides from Congress. Guilty. Guilty.
#MurphyBrown Murphy Brown,  you were a breath of fresh air. Loved the opening tweets with Donald Trump. The interview with Hilary Clinton was Surpris..Hire Hilary for the show.   Loved tonight's show.  The Show is Sensational. It is a Hit
@terry_craighead Murphy Brown, was awesome. I love the way she joked around with Donald Trump and the tweets. I loved it more when she interviewed Hilary Clinton. Please Hire Hilary for the news room position?? The opening was Absolutely amazing. Keep up the great work. Loved It.
@TomShillueShow Predators prey on the weak not the strong. Boys don't admit to fondling raping girls. The president only admits it when he's behind closed doors fondling and doing what they want with women just like Bill Cosby. They are all predators they do what they can get by with.
@TomShillueShow If Brett Kavanaugh was innocent he would have told them to give him a polygraph test to prove his innocence instead of saying that it is not admissible in court. He came across as angry belligerent on the stand. (Retweeting)
@TomShillueShow I tried to call the number to Tom Shillue show and was unable to get through to the show.
@TomShillueShow If Brent Calvin always innocent he would have told them to give him a polygraph test to prove his innocence instead of saying that is not admissible in court. To me that showing his lack of telling the truth. He came across as angry belligerent on the stand.
@TomShillueShow If Judge Kavanaugh was innocent he should tell everybody to give him a polygraph test to prove his innocence. He should not say that it's not admissible in court. To me that shows a little bit of guilt. Polygraph test shows innocence or guilt.
@TomShillueShow what is your number??
#KavanaughHearings No one forgets an attack. If a man really wants to rape someone he will tear off the clothes. Boys must learn from this not to commit crimes against another person. Parents teach your children not to commit a sexual assault, harassment. ETC.
@SenatorDurbin The five minute questions is trying to find out if the female accuses other males at other times. Does a female have a record of accusing males of assaulting them? That's what she's trying to get at. Victims never forget the assault.
@CourtneyHadwin Courtney,  you have an absolutely awesome and fantastic voice. We need more rock and roll. We miss it. You have got a God-given voice and talent. You sing it girl.. I want to hear you on radio and buy your CD. Simon sign her now.

@RandallRatchfor Randall,  thank you for following me.  God bless you and remember to love your fellow man.
@DavidBegnaud Because of Donald Trump's age 70's they do tend to have out burst,out bursts of anger and shouting and an uncontrollable.And you can't reason with them because of their mental state.That sounds like what Donald Trump has going. The mind starts going around  70.
@DavidBegnaud This President lives in a bubble. He is in his 70's. That it when the elderly minds starts to go. A person should not be voted into president past the age of 65 which is the age to retire. You must be 65 and younger to be voted in to be president.
@Rodney44909786 Rodney, it was nice nice talking to you.  People  have the right to agree or disagree but still stay stay civil and remain friends in doing so. I hope I can call you a my new friend. God bless you.  Be kind and love every one.
@Rodney44909786 To me, in these situations I think the military should get involved and set up plans way ahead of time to take care of these situations. The military is the best to truly take care of things. The military leaves no one behind no matter what.
@Rodney44909786 Puerto Rico still has many parts of that territory that does not even have electricity. After this long that's appalling. Just think Mr. Rodney if you lived in Puerto Rico and that happened to you how would you feel? If you ask for help  and you're living with no electricity
@Rodney44909786 Rodney, with all due respect. The people of Puerto Rico ask for help and they did not get help in a timely manner. They are still suffering they don't have proper food water that stagnant and is not healthy to drink they don't have the proper medical help.They have asked for help
@Rodney44909786 We should have had navel medical ships ready to take care of those people for as long as it takes. We should have sent military troops to Puerto Rico to help clean up and help rebuild that territory. Our government forgot about or did not care about Puerto Rico. Is Appalling.
@Rodney44909786 If you are talking about Hurricane Maria?  This government forgot about Puerto Rico. We should have had military ships ready to go to Puerto Rico. We should have gotten the people of Puerto Rico that was sick to come to us and our hospitals for medical help.
@Rodney44909786 Preparation. You always need to have an Escape Plan. They have been talking about this massive 700 miles wide of total Destruction is going to hit that area. The medical patients should have had a plan to move when they started talking about this massive destructive
Oh, Mrs. Irma. Young Lady you can dance.  I am so happy to see that the staff gets involved with the young seniors. They need love and care. They need to feel young again. They need attention. One Day We Are Going To Be In Their Shoes. God bless everyone.

Hurricane Florence. For those people that are in the HOSPICE Center's that the Government Did Not Get Out. They Should Have Been Given Their Dignity to Get Out and die In Peace. Medical patients should have been Moved weeks ago in a plane. SHAME ON YOU GOVERNMENT.
#HurricanceFlorence I am praying for those people that are in the HOSPICE Center's that the Government Did Not Get Out. They Should Have Been Given Their Dignity to Get Out and die In Peace. Medical patients should have been Moved weeks ago in a plane. SHAME ON YOU GOVERNMENT.
I thought this was a brilliant idea to do these photos with these children like this. It looks like they had a lot of fun. What a great way to remember your time in school.  God bless everyone.
#CNN In Mississippi. Three Schools in Florence Mississippi on lock Down.  Wide Spread Police officers presents.
@TheView Stand your ground on Puerto Rico. It is sad that our president could not help Puerto Rico like it does the mainland of the United States. Puerto Rico is a territory of our country and the president forgot about them. Shameful.
@NBCNews It is sad that the President said upwards of 3,000 people died in Puerto Rico Maria hurricane is a success. That is an outrage and a disgrace to say. If that were the in land of USA they would been evacuated. Why didn't our president Evacuate the People from Puerto Rico. Grade F
@GovParsonMO @THETimHaynes Deputy Sheriff Aaron P. Robert's thank you for your service. May God rest your soul.
#PuertoRicoDeathToll it's appalling that our president gives himself an a plus when there's upwards of $3,000 that died in Puerto Ricos Maria hurricane.Absolutely appalling. Is appalling the president get the people of Puerto Rico off the island knowing how bad it was going to be
@anitapetterson1  Hi Anita, do you live in Clinton, Ms? I know an Anita but I have not been her in a long time. She lives in Clinton, Ms.  Thank you.
#HurricaneFlorence Praying for the people of North and South Carolina.  Get out.Get your important papers and animals and leave.Don't stay like the ones in Louisiana. There officials were not smart enough 2get them out. Mississippi had a direct hit destroyed the Mississippi Coast

@DavidSable These girls should have been judged on their looks also. What is it these girls not fixing there hair????  Some of them looked like they jumped out of the shower.
@ShayTorie @PhillyTrib @MissAmericaOrg It is sad that these girls are making this a race issue.
#MissAmerica Please tell these girls that are trying to sing that they can not sing those songs. To their vocal coaches please get them to sing a song that they can sing that is not out of range or out of pitch. Be honest with them. They can't sing.

Kaepernick, why dont you go out into your community and teach people Stop committing crimes. Give them money for centers,Education. Kneeling has nothing to do with Injustice that's just disrespectful the flag. Go out and talk to the people that's your statement.
@nanettejw @Pappenjazz @Sogburn57 @EAKoyle @Newsweek @IvankaTrump Why does people say the Trumps are royalty. The are far from royalty. Royalty has class and morals. And does not act crazy. How can they have respect for their father who only has relationships with prostitutes strippers and immoral women.That shows what an immoral man he is.
@cindymccain America has always been Great. In my opinion. If a person doesn't think our country is great they shouldn't be able to run or become the President of our country. I say vote For Vice President Mike Pence for president next time.
@cindymccain @MeghanMcCain I was proud of her and the Speech she gave. I think to be President you must have served time in the Military. In order to direct The military you must know what it is like to have served in the military. My father served in Korean war and past of Cancer.
JudgeKavanaugh,  The United States does not need someone to set us back to the Stone Age. Do Not Vote for him. He is hiding something by not disclosing those hundreds of thousands of pages to the public. That's dishonest.
@EllenDeGenerex Breaking News.. Ellen DeGeneres Missing..  Where is Ellen? The people miss you.
Puerto Rico nearly 3,000 u.s. citizens  is part of our country and they've been let down by our government. Meaning no food no water no prescrip. no medical help no elect.They must never be forgotten. Our government needs to step up and do something for the people of Puerto Rico.

@realDonaldTrump I think they all need to be audited.  If you are working you don't take your family with you then spend tax payers money.  If you want to take your family then go on a vacation and pay for it yourself and not our money.
@realDonaldTrump President Trump,  Molly Tibbett was a young woman killed by a Mexican illegal man here and United States. President Trump we beg you to put a wall up to protect our citizens from harm. We need the Wall.
@JerryDunleavy Remembering: Chief Warrant Officer  Taylor J. Galvin. God rest his soul.
@WeWontBend @rydelldaniels, filming a three year old boy singing the National Anthem and standing proudly for the flag isn't the same as kneeling and being coward in protest for the flag. If they want to protest go to their communities donate money tell them not to commit crimes.
@WeWontBend I wish this young man could teach the football players how too have respect and salute and stand for our American flag. God bless you young man.  I am so proud of you.

@realDonaldTrump @GovMikeHuckabee @foxandfriends President Donald Trump,  we support you and  think you are doing a wonderful job in the White House.  I would like a response to the short term and long term insurance issue.  If that is possible.  Thank you For your time and consideration.
@realDonaldTrump @GovMikeHuckabee @foxandfriends Dear Mr. President, we ask that you end short term insurance and put long term back in it's place. Short term insurance does not cover pain management or a serious illness. People are struggling they need a good affordable insurance. We ask that you do an executive order for this
@realDonaldTrump @GovMikeHuckabee @foxandfriends The unemployment numbers are inaccurate. Because all the people who are unemployed try to get unemployment and are unable to. So those people are not recorded in the system. The only ones that are recorded are twho file for it. There are many unemployed people don't get counted.
@CourtneyHadwin Courtney, young lady you have such an Awesome..voice. They should sign you to a record deal. I am ready to buy just like the rest of America. You sound so much like the Great Janis Joplin. You are a fantastic singer. You should win. Your fan. Ms America _ USA
@realDonaldTrump Football players stand tall for our Flag or go with out pay or get Fired. If you want to make a statement then teach criminals not to commit crimes in those communities. Donate money 2 teach people not to commit crimes to your communities.

@barbiebeth_ Bethany, some people tell other people they look like other people. For some reason I  am told that a girl looks just like me. They even get us mixed up and call me her name all the time. I don't think it's racist and I don't pay it any attention. Have a blessed day.
@barbiebeth_ Hello Bethany, how are you doing today? I just had to respond. People used to tell me I looked like Halle Berry. Whomever said that was showing their ignorance. You do not look like Whoopi Goldberg. Whites do not think all blacks look the same. Have a blessed day.

@realDonaldTrump Dear President Donald Trump. I am asking you to put a halt on the 3D making weapons. Please make it illegal. People who have mental issues will be getting these guns, criminals etc. Put the innocent people first. Thank you
@WeWontBend @JessieJaneDuff A Petition to President Trump. I would like you to make an executive order that our men and women in military can pray anytime they want to. Their lives are at stake and their health. Everyone sign the petition. Thank you. God bless everybody
@WeWontBend @JessieJaneDuff Our forefathers created this country with religion. If you study our forefathers that is what this country was based on was the Christian religion God's religion. It is sad when go to all these other countries and convert people to Christianity. But in this country is taken away
@WeWontBend @JessieJaneDuff They legally they cannot take Prayer away. They can not stop them. It is called Freedom of Speech. They fight and there lives are the line. If Soldiers want to pray. Then let them. You can't take God out of them no matter what. God bless America and Soldiers.
@wethreemusic @barbiebeth_ @wethreemusic You three are amazing. Love your music. Your first song that you sang moved me to tears because my Mother and Father both past of cancer. Remember that your Mother is watching you from Heaven and smiling because she is so proud of her children. God bless all of you.
@wethreemusic I just love your music. I am waiting for for CD. Your mother is watching from Heaven and you know she is so very proud of her children. May God bless all of you.  Simon, sign a recording deal Now! We want there CD..
@AGT_Auditions Oliver we Love you.  God bless you my friend.
This is my opinion.  We should have a limit to where a person can be voted in as president. No one over the age of 65 should be voted in as a president. 65 is the age of retirement. The ones in Congress should retire at 65 and let new people and new ideas in.
@bitchfork Wish I could follow you but it doesn't give me the option.
@WKRG Deputy Sheriff,  love the video. Thank you for taking of the tortoise. It is nice to see you helping in a nonviolent way. We all know your job it extremely dangerous. I wish people would stop committing crimes.  Keep up the great work. God Bless you.
@VanJones68 When it comes to the roll of the President. I hope That The United States of America will never ever vote someone in their Late 60s or 70s For a President again. There should be a rule on it.
@iamAliCaldwell Ali, I have to say this.  Those judges that did not choose you were stupid crazy.
@chrissyteigen @benhiggi @TheRachLindsay @paramountnet Christine, you make the show Lip Sync Battle.  You have the best personalities for the show.
I think it unprofessional that the females did not call Judge Shapiro by her professional title Judge. Whoopi you are to old to act like that. Today all of you were pointing at each other and You did not get mad at them. https://t.co/9qRnp179a5
@JudgeJeanine Reguarding The View. I thought it was very unprofessional of the women of The View not calling the judge by her title. It's very unprofessional to call her by her first name.
@SenWarren @realDonaldTrump I have to say this. No one wanted Hillary Clinton as President.  The people made their minds up a long time ago about the Clinton's. Unfortunately we voted in a president that is just as crooked, no morals, lies on every other word. You would think he would stay with the allies.
@StephenAtHome Love your show.
Welcome  Judge Brett Kavanaugh To The Supreme Court.
Thailand, praying for the boys in the caves that they get out safely and without harm. We ask God to be with them and The Rescuers to get them out safely and back to their families.
@realDonaldTrump I think the female who climb the Statue of Liberty should have her citizenship revoked and she should be sent back to her country for breaking the laws.
@StephenAtHome  I Love your show.  Great Show on 6/28/18
@realDonaldTrump Dear President Trump. I would like you to have a chat with #TheView.Joy Behar. She made the statement that you didn't care about the children at the border because they were not white. Joy's statement was very racist. She should be Fired. Thank you for your time
@TheView Joy you were very wrong for saying President Trump doesn't care for the children at the border because they are not white. You are an immoral person for saying that.
Good Morning America.  Have a Blessed Day.
@LynKY1950  I apologize. I  hope we can become friends on here. You have a blessed day.
@LynKY1950 @jmreycroft @Riverbenddiva @pennydouph @PoliticalAnt @funder @wesley_jordan @GOP With Respect Lyn, America is Not Rich. We have Millions of people Living on the streets. Children and their families. We have American Soldiers Homeless on the streets. Some people need to get out of their bubble and look at what's really going on, in America.
With Due Respect. America has all of that. People thank America's Rich it is not. People are rich in America and people are poor on the streets of America. America has homeless American soldiers on the streets. America is not taking care of its own people. Praying for all https://t.co/Er736xNN7k
I am praying for this country. Praying for the refugees and the children. It saddens me that the parents of the children would torture their children by doing this. I am praying for this world. Dear God, please take care of all your children. In your we pray. Amen
@TheView Time Magazine photo was cropped.  That child was standing by her mother. The mother was thrown out of the US three times before. That child Was Not a refugee. The Mother kidnapped the child from her Father.  The Father contacted Time Magazine. Mom was at US Customs by her child.
@Riverbenddiva I am not trying to be mean.  Children are being trafficked. Mean sold into the sex trade in and from these countries.  I work with among others work the these children. They are also being stolen from the birth parents. We have amber alerts. They do not.
@Riverbenddiva @pennydouph @PoliticalAnt @funder @wesley_jordan This Country cannot afford any one from any other country to come here and live free or off of my money and your money. Build a Wall,Shut down the border. The little girl on Time was standing by her mother.  It was Photoshopped.
@rubendelavega11 @Riverbenddiva @4nancyfhunt @funder @wesley_jordan It is not overdue. That is insane. We can't take care of everyone or every country.  We cannot take care of our own country. We have children thousands and thousands of children in American soldiers in the streets starving. USA first. Let them live in Mexico.
@Riverbenddiva @PoliticalAnt @funder @wesley_jordan Mexico is Not Helping with any of those people and the immigrants are on Mexico's side. Send them home. Listen, we have gangs here violence,  crime we can't control. No excuses let them live in Mexico. We need a Wall. The Wall.
@Riverbenddiva @PoliticalAnt @funder @wesley_jordan Our Country is going to go Bankrupt.  They should seek asylum in Mexico and citizenship. Mexico is there type of culture not America. Americans have hundreds of thousands of children on the streets. We have veterans on our streets homeless no food. What about them??? So Sad.
@Riverbenddiva @PoliticalAnt @funder @wesley_jordan It is sad. Immigrant parents are to blame.  They are abusing their own children. The new you cannot go into any country illegally and no consequence. It is sad. Those parents are the ones who are abusing their children by making them go through this. So sad. Praying for them.
@RachelD1612 What show?
@LevineJonathan Let Immigrants file and become a citizen in Mexico. People have No clue how rampant and wide spread it is for them to sell their children to Sex Traffickers. Meaning children having sex with adults that's what they do. Horrifying. People have No idea what it's like. Wake Up. USA
@LevineJonathan I am so proud of President Trump.  Thank you for signing that bill.  Close the boarder. If you open it you will let in baby smugglers and sex traffickers in. We are working with children from sexual abuse cases. Some of These people sell their children to horrible people. SAD.
@thehill We can't take in the entire world in. America has Gangs we can't get control of. They are making excuses to get in. Let them live In Mexico,  Mexico.  We are praying for them.
@thehill Send the immigrants back to Mexico let them seek asylum in Mexico. Let them live in Mexico it's more of their culture. American people cannot afford it and I am frankly tired of my tax dollars going to people who shouldn't be her.
@thehill We have American soldiers who fought and was wounded in the wars living on the streets. And you think we need immigrants coming into this country. We can't even put our own people in houses and feed them and get them medical attention.
@thehill American people are struggling to make a living they're struggling to feed their families. Americans have worked their intire life added Social Security work three jobs. Illegals are going to come over and get everything free that's not right.They are going to bankrupt our system
@thehill Immigrant parents new that you cannot enter the United States illegally there are consequences. Those parents are the ones they're torturing their children they knew what was going to happen. They knew what was going to happen it's their fault.
@thehill Immigrant parents are the ones who are torturing their own children. Mexico should legalize these people. American people can't afford them.  We have hundreds of thousands children on the streets no parent no food no home only the streets.
@realDonaldTrump  The Immigrants need to seek asylum in Mexico first. They need to file for citizenship in Mexico first. Americans first. We cannot afford anyone else into this country or support them. No support for them send them home. It's Sad. Praying 4 All.
@KeishaBottoms I watched you on CNN. 1st this immigrant situation is nothing like the civil rights during the 60s. Secondly we do not need any more crime in the USA. It's the parents fault for children's misfortunes. Put USA Citizens First. We cannot afford them will go bankrupt
@realDonaldTrump Please send them all back. American people can't afford them. If you let one in it sets a precedence to let others in. Let them stay and live in Mexico. Sex, Stolen children will be brought over the border. Stand Strong. Stay Very Firm. We stand beside you.
@POTUS Close the Boarder. Send all of them to Mexico. Stay Strong Stand Strong. 100% send back. Let one in and that sets a case for the rest to get in. Please put your foot down. USA will go bankrupt if they stay. Praying for all people.
@POTUS Please No Open Borders. Let them live in Mexico.  Close the Boarder. Protect us. All those countries are bad. Don't corrupt American lives. Don't let them in. Stay Strong. We Stand beside you.  Stay Strong. We can't afford them. USA will go bankrupt.
@POTUS President Trump, we stand beside you.  Close the boarder. BUILD THE WALL. We can't afford them. Send All of them back.  We Pray for all of them. Put Americans First...
@TheView Michael Eric, as intelligent as you are you show your ignorance when it comes to the Confederate flag. It was designed 39 years after the Confederate War. The American flag was flown. Over 30 designs were made before the final design. Tell people the truth.
@LionelRichie @AmericanIdol @MaddiePoppe So proud of Maddie.
#RoyalWedding Everyone says everyone was there.  No, everyone was not there.  Meghan's Father and family was not their except her mother was the only one of her family. An American family would wonder what they R getting into with that type of separation N a family
#MeghanMarkle I think it is so sad that Meghan did not have her family there besides her mother. Her mother had to feel absolutely alone.
@stevenfurtick Amen
@GabbyBarrett_ Gabby, whew wow. What a great way to start the show.  You go girl.
@LionelRichie @AmericanIdol @SheilaEdrummer @katyperry @LukeBryanOnline @LionelRichie Please don't tell Michael he sounds like or is good as Prince or Celine Dion.    You were wrong for that. I am not trying to be mean. I like Michael. Catie should have stayed she is better. America, your voting was wrong on that vote. Michael is a good kid.
@carrieunderwood @AmericanIdol Carrie,  thank you for sing songs with such amazing feelings. You touch so many people with your beautiful voice.  Like my mother who had cancer. You touch so many people that you may not know.  Thank you and God bless you.
@carrieunderwood @AmericanIdol My mother who had cancer heard Carrie sing How Great Thou Art while we were driving in the car she broke down as and said it was the most beautiful she had ever heard it sung. My mother had terminal cancer. Mom wanted it played at her funeral.  She cried over that song.
@AmericanIdol @MichaelJWoodard 1Catie. 2 Journee 3 Michael
@AmericanIdol @MichaelJWoodard I am not trying to be mean but Michael's singing was not at the same level as Caties sing. Caties sing is if star quality and ready for the stage. If you tell Michael his singing is a match or as great as Prince. Celine Dion   yall are being dishonest. Immaturity shows in sing.

@TheView The reason why there is a back log in testing rape kits is because boys are taught that forcing a female to have is normal and not rape. So the men taking the evidence don't believe the female. #Metoo
@AmericanIdol I wish they would not send four home next week.  That's horrible and so sad. I think it should be only one a week.  All of you have worked so hard to get where you are now.  All of you have such great talents.  Praying for all of you.  God bless all of you.
@AmericanIdol @MarcioDonaldson @allen_stone I hope and pray that the contestants that did not make it on the show.  Remember,  you will have record deals awaiting for all of you.

@MAD_Goddess1 w Then he returned to his disciples and said to them, “Are you still sleeping and taking your rest? Behold, the hour is at hand when the Son of Man is to be handed over to sinners.46Get up, let us go. Look, my betrayer is at hand
@MAD_Goddess1 Then he returned once more and found them asleep, for they could not keep their eyes open.44He left them and withdrew again and prayed a third time, saying the same thing again.
@MAD_Goddess1 n he returned to his disciples he found them asleep. He said to Peter, “So you could not keep watch with me for one hour?41Watch and pray that you may not undergo the test.* The spirit is willing, but the flesh is weak.
@MAD_Goddess1 When he returned to his disciples he found them asleep. He said to Peter, “So you could not keep watch with me for one hour?41Watch and pray that you may not undergo the test.* The spirit is willing, but the flesh is weak.”42* v Withdrawing a second time, he prayed again,
@MAD_Goddess1 t Then he said to them, “My soul is sorrowful even to death.* Remain here and keep watch with me.”39u He advanced a little and fell prostrate in prayer, saying, “My Father,* if it is possible, let this cup pass from me; yet, not as I will, but as you will.”40When he returned
@MAD_Goddess1 The Agony in the Garden.36 Then Jesus came with them to a place called Gethsemane,* and he said to his disciples,“Sit here while I go over there and pray.”37s H!e took along Peter and the“My Father, if it is possible, let this cup pass from me; yet, not as I will, but as you will
@MAD_Goddess1 ￼		As Jesus prayed, He began to tremble because of the pain. An angel came to strengthen Him. He suffered so much that he sweat drops of blood. He was suffering for all of our sins so that we can be forgiven if we repent.
@MaraJustine1  Mara, keep that energy up every once in a while on stage. We Love the energy.  80's and 90's groups they would flip and swing hair around. We are tired of these so called stars Doing Nothing On Stage.  We Love your singing and style in which you sing.

#JesusChristSuperstarLive People must Read the Bible. It was not not with all the facts of the Bible. Stop saying things that Jesus did not say. People in Hollywood need to Read the Bible. Get the the facts straight. Mary did not touch Jesus like that.  Sacriligious
#JesusChristSuperstarLive This is not an accurate account of the story. Jesus knew why he was on earth and was to die for our sins. At the end 3 men were on a cross of on Rt then on Lt. So much was missed. 4  those who don't know their bible. Study your bible. Study KJV

#TMZonTV TMZ, it is not funny making fun of people who have cancer or them losing their hair. For the blonde-headed one for all of you you need to go spend time at cancer centers with people who have cancer and children with cancer. It's not funny too many are dying.
@TheTalkCBS I do hope that the father made his child go and apologize to the person that he was bullying
@TheTalkCBS Absolutely parents must teach their children not to bully. That shows a dad paying attention and solving the problem. I'll bet that his kid won't bully anybody else. Tough love. When We Were Young we got the belt. We didn't have all this bullying When We Were Young. We had morals

#TheBachelor Ellen Degeneres Next Bachelorette. Ellen DeGeneres we vote you in for the next Bachelorette. Or at least to say here's the last rose rose or the next rose.
@TheEllenShow @BachelorABC Hey Ellen, you need to be they next Bachelorette. You're adorable Ellen we love you all of us we love you
@TheEllenShow @BachelorABC I wish you can make corrections to what you tweet on here.
@TheEllenShow @BachelorABC Arie, you're such a sweet-talker to this blonde girl and you show your immaturity. Arie, you know it she would have turned you down you would have regretted breaking it off with the other one. This shows desperation after taking him back. She's only a second best to the first one
@TheEllenShow @BachelorABC If Arie broke up with her in a respectful way who would have never seen her again he wouldn't have gone to her hotel and stalked her. When she said to leave he should have left and that was it he should have no never going back to see her. Laurel your desperate for taking back.
@TheEllenShow @BachelorABC Arie played both girls. He had Sex with both and now he is confused.
#TheBachelor I think Chris Harrison wanted to show this to show how pathetic of a man Arie really really is. How do you not know who you're in love with way before the end of show?
#TheBachelor If one of those girls take him back that will show how desperate they are if they take him back.
@TheView I would not want someone who does not have as much experience to get the same pay as someone who has a lot more experience. If the two have the same experience the same job as many years, they should get paid the same pay.

They have a deal with Omarosa the stay in the game. The deal is that Amoroso will win. They want her in there so she can talk about the White House and get the scoop on that and tell all the nasty secrets that are there. It's a Game Deal Emarosa won't go https://t.co/qAbx7VxpaI

Hours Before His Death, Billy Graham’s Facebook Page Published A Hauntingly Beautiful Message #Topbuzz	https://t.co/DazxjWMQAL
@John_Barnitt  John, my prayers are with you. If they put negative news in the media please don't pay attention to it that shows their ignorance. You say stay strong in your convictions and what you're doing. Your generation are the ones who's going to make a change. God bless U.
Jemele should be fired. What is it when Caucasian Americans rally together for their beliefs you call a white https://t.co/6J78Vo5XRi are black Americans rally are they some type of supremacist??? Jamil you're just racist. We had a president who was biracial. We all voted him in https://t.co/SP4wy6w7PG
@cnzpll  Emma Gonzales for President.  She has time and she knows more about history then he does probably. This generation these young adults are our next congressmen and congresswomen and the next president.
#EmmaGonzales Vote for Emma Gonzales for the next President of the United States.
@CBSNews At the point I hate to say it but parents are going to have to start checking their kids teenagers rooms looking for weapons. Take them away teenagers have no right to have these weapons. Parents take them away. Parents question? Why do they have a military assault rifles?????
@CBSNews I was so proud of our young people standing up to the president the Congress men and women and letting them know what they will do. When they turn 18 that's it it's a game changer. Get the ones out that won't do their jobs instead of just putting money in their pockets.
@CBSNews Students you are the Next Generation to get this world straightened out. You will vote the ones out who did not vote for gun control out. Vote in the ones in that will ban military weapons from civilians. You will be the next Congressman Congresswomen  and President
Congressman, Congresswoman, If these children were your children that were shot killed. You would make a bill that would stop the selling of military guns to civilians. That is if those were your children you do something about it. They're not, so you won't stop sells of  guns. https://t.co/CDEHQSnl3o
RT @SenWarren: This is what democracy looks like. #GunReformNow https://t.co/AMLVOSpaBY
#BBCeleb The two to vote off would be Amoroso and the blonde-headed housewife. If MRI so truly had asthma she would have never left or go anywhere without an inhaler. This show only wants to hear about what happened in the White House.
#BBCeleb Amber Rose's husband is a real preacher?  He should be ashamed of his wife getting on there or been anywhere in acting like she does.
#BBCeleb Do these people have a brain? Do they not know to get Amorosa out. That's one of the first ones they should have gotten out. I think they've got a wager to keep her Amorosa in the game. This game is rigged. Rigged
American's if people are serious about getting rid of military weapons they should hand over their military weapons to the police officers police departments in their cities and states.
Americans. We need a bill that prohibits the sale of military weapons to civilians the public. An American citizen civilian does not need a military weapon of any type. Pass a bill to stop selling military weapons to civilians.
#BanMachineGuns Band Machine Guns and any other military style weapon. If you're not old enough to buy liquor, you should not  be allowed to buy a gun.
In January 2018  Six shooting attempts in Mississippi at 6 different schools. Parents take responsibility take these guns away from these kids in these teenagers pay attention to your children. If they're not old enough to buy alcohol that shouldn't buy guns.
In Ohio, a 12 year old shot him self at school today.  02/21/2018
Reverend Billy Graham, rest in peace. He will be missed. We always enjoyed watching his show on television and still do watch his programs on television. He's a special angel in heaven. God bless him and God be with his family. https://t.co/2Fk7W5jnoV
@scaredcurly It is Sad that is a double standard with blacks to the whites. Black Americans can do what they want. They can stand up for what they want. But they don't allow Coquette white people locations to stand up for what they believe without being called supremacist. Shame on y'all.
@scaredcurly Jemele needs to be fired from her job because of the statements that she made. Why is it when white people gather they are called white supremacist. Instead of just standing up for their rights.What are black Americans called when they get together are they supremacist just black
@scaredcurly The women on The View are afraid to hear the truth that Meghan McCain talks about. That's why they shut her up. The women on The View need to shut up and let Meghan talk. I think it's racist that black Americans are the only ones who don't like Meghan McCain.
Women on The View need to be quiet and let Meghan McCain talk. https://t.co/CUknjn3M4h

@TheView @jemelehill Jemelehill, why is it that when Caucasian people rally together you call a white supremacist when black Americans rally together it's nothing wrong with it in your eyes. you should be fired from your job. You're racist for making that remark.
@TheView Question,  Why is it when White people unite they are racist. But when black people gather they're not called racist or any other name. Just white people why is that? Just because white people rally but doesn't mean they're racist.
@NEELYmusic  Thank you for following.  Great music keep coming.  Nice to meet you. God bless all of you.

@rpadnis Rachel, I am praying for you and your class mates. Remember always turn to God for guidance. Remember when y'all talk turn 18 it's time to vote. You can vote those out that support the NIR. You are the next Congress men women and president of your generation.
I want to know what someone thought when they were selling him an assault rifle a rifle that should only be used in the military. Civilians should not get these type of assault machines. Stop selling military guns to civilians. https://t.co/IJ5L7vaDOT
#DouglasHighSchool My prayers are with all of you strong young men and women.  The FBI Agents who fail to report the reporting's of this teenager that he was going to shoot a school up those FBI should be fired immediately.
#PresidentTrump Please fire the FBI agents that didn't take the phone calls seriously and did not check into it. All phone calls made about school shootings should be prompt and checked into. Why didn't they catch it on the internet?
When Will Christ Return Here Jesus Answer........ #Topbuzz	https://t.co/VzIZekx17K
@RickSantorum The system failed in getting him help. Someone at the school should have been a mentor for this boy. Someone an adult at the school should have reached out to him and talk to him. This country failed him. Someone should have helped him. Help our young people. Thank you
@RickSantorum Regarding the young man who did the heinous shooting and murdering. It is sad that all the adults new he had a mental problem and did not get him help. There are ways to get help if you don't have the money. He was in foster care they could have gotten him psychological help
@realDonaldTrump @KcGreuter The Wall we need it. Illegals should not be able to bring their families to America.

@TheView Whoopi Goldberg &amp; the Gang we want a wall. We want President Trump to build the wall. Too many drugs are coming across from Mexico don't be stupid go look for yourself.
@FLOTUS First Lady Melania Trump, it is a pleasure meeting you. May I ask for your help in getting a History Month just like Black History Month for the American Indians that were here on this land first. Please help us recognize them. Thank you for your time.
@FLOTUS @Veteran4Trump We need a Month for the American Indians. We do not study about the  American Indians it's either about the Europeans are black Americans. It's time that give we give respect and educate people on the American Indians. They are the true Americans they were here on this land first
@sabine_durden What about The American Dreamers? What about our children? We can barely afford schools and college for our children that's breaking us. It's not fair for other countries to come in and get a free education and get our Social Security money.
@NorahODonnell I personally think it's time for the wall to be built. A limit on the dreamers it keeps going up. It was eight hundred thousand that went to over a million. If they commit a crime that should be sent back home. No families come over.
@CBSNews President Trump, if the dreamers are going to stay.  I hope there's a stipulation that if they commit a crime they are sent back to their country.
@FoxNews @POTUS Immigrants should only have the parent that lives in the country at the time. They should not be able to bring any relatives to this country.   If they commit a crime they should be sent back to their country..
@FoxNews @POTUS President Trump, I'm so proud of you. Now it's time to build the wall. To stop the criminals stop the drugs and stop the murderers. I also asked you if you would stop giving refunds to all the females who keep having children out of wedlock.
@CBSNews President Trump please sign the bill for the wall then something for the dreamers. People from other country should not get a free ride it's sad we can't even afford her own children to go to college and they get it free. Sign The wall first.
@nancycordes @SenateMajLdr President Trump please signed the bill for The Wall, then sign the bill for the dreamers. It's time we stop letting people into this country who can't pay their taxes pay there children to go to school, college Etc. We can barely afford it for our children.
#PresidentTrump It is time for The Wall. No singing of Dreamers without it.
People in my day our parents couldn't afford to send us to college and they didn't have large families. There were two to three jobs and all these dreamers and the families get a free education. I say it's time for the wall. I'm not trying to be mean.
800 Thousand Dreams in the USA. Just think how many of their parents have been here undocumented not working paying taxes. Their children getting free education free tax return. I'm not trying to be mean or ugly.
Robert E Lee Day. Is what we celebrate. It was first.
@realDonaldTrump President Trump,  build that wall.
@realDonaldTrump How are these DACA children and their parents going to pay back there free education. We the American taxpayers should not be paying for their education 's. We cannot even afford our children to go to college verses giving free education away to DACA.
@terri_georgia @RollingStone #PresidentTrump please help the white race to not erased by the black race. The black race wants to erase our heritage. They want to take our flag, the Confederate which was created 39 years after the Confederate War. They want to steal our statues. Please put an end to it.
@terri_georgia @RollingStone Dear President Trump,  I asked you if you would please stop these black Americans from erasing White History taking away Confederate statues in the flags. People don't understand the Confederate flag was created 39 years after the Confederate War. That shows people's ignorance.
@terri_georgia @RollingStone No more people from Africa Haiti Mexico any of those countries that come over here and live off Americans should not come over here. No more free loading. And we are so sick and tired of hearing about Black Americans not getting this and that they're getting everything free.
@terri_georgia @RollingStone I do wish the other people would stop coming into this country stop getting welfare free education. We the American people who work we have to pay for our children's education. No fruit free food stamps or anything else nothing free. Pay your taxes illegal people
@terri_georgia @RollingStone First of all is not racist when he says that Haiti in those countries why do we have to keep getting some of those people into America versus other countries. Secondly you need to even out on getting people from different countries not just from Haiti or Africa.

@TODAYshow @TheTodayShow  I think the question is you wonderful talk show host should ask. Why didn't the school's teachers and principles stop this bullying and harassment of this child. Are they not watching their children at school? Fire all of them.
@TODAYshow #StandWithKeaton I hope Ellen Degeneres will show up at Keaton's school and talk to those bullies.
@TODAYshow Keaton,  I am so proud of you. Now let's get down to business why hasn't these teachers stopped these other kids from bullying him? Why hasn't the principal stopped this bullying. If the teachers and the principal did not stop it they should all be fired.
@TODAYshow #StandWithKeaton I am so proud of you telling people what is happening at your school.  Now,  the Teachers and Principles should be ashamed of yourself for not stopping this young boy from being bullied. You should all be fired.

I don't know why some Black people think they should get everything free and not work for it. Create Your Businesses For your Community's.
In Black communities they still are killing each other. People It is time to realize that White people aren't the problem You Are, You Are.

Parents get off your Lazy Ass ( sorry Bad word.)Teach children a lot of Morals. Like  you don't kill, rape still fight with Law Enforcement
I am just sick of hearing White people are to blame. You have your own communities Stop being Stupid We R N America.
Police Lives Matter. If you are a community that has crime and killing each other Don't Call the Police so a White officer is not blamed.
I guess I am so sick of Black Americans blaming White people for there problems.We have a President who is Biracial.White Grands raided him
Why is it when a black person is killed by a white person it is Racism? When a black person kills a white person it is not called Racism??
A white girl named Jessica was burned to death in Mississippi.  A Black mail burned her to death while she was alive. Where was the NWACP?

My thoughts on the Bible.Christians have rights that should not be taken away or imposed on. We should not let people go against our beliefs
Thoughts on the Bible second part. For the LGBT it is not that Christians are against you or trying to infringe on your rights.  Find 3rd.
This is my thoughts on Religion.  If you go by God's word you can do no wrong. God pacifically Point sound sin in the Bible.
America, I wonder when the candidates are going to stop acting like children grow a back bone and get to the real issues at hand. Its a joke
Happy Easter to all my tweeter friends. God bless all of you.

@DailySignal We need a President who will tell the people if you commit a crime you will do the time.  Parents should be accountable.

We need to pray for God's chosen President.
