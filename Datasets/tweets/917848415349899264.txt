White House Adult Daycare will pay $5,000,000 for the pee-pee tape. Getting Donnie to behave would be much easier with this kind of leverage https://t.co/IlJggzrkli
We offered Roy Moore a staff position here, but he declined saying our clients were "too seasoned" #RoyMooreChildMolester
Sorry Bob,	Donnie can spot a grifter in a New York minute. "Takes one to know one!" he always tells us #AlertTheDaycareStaff https://t.co/OWA2lGVWGO
We often use the word 'zoo' to describe the daycare center on Mueller Mondays #AlertTheDaycareStaff https://t.co/JRhhPnMtTD

And then do nothing about 🔫. #GunControl #GunControlNow #TexasChurchMassacre #texaschurchshooting https://t.co/UwK4ByaZuY
Donnie often says he's wearing pull-ups when it's just regular underwear. It's a bigly cleanup job #AlerttheDaycareStaff #TrumpBaitandSwitch
When the daycare plays army, Donnie pretends he had bone spurs &amp; sits out of the game. He's a very convincing actor! #AlertTheDaycareStaff https://t.co/KfAozEdP6k
Unlike other toddlers, Donnie watches all the news channels simultaneously, but only listens to @FoxNews #AlertTheDaycareStaff https://t.co/HGyQdXnM9K

Sorry Bob,	Bob Mueller stole his milk money yesterday &amp; he's lashing out at everyone #AlertTheDaycareStaff https://t.co/9IAU7WuYFu
Sorry Bob,	The biggest story yesterday was the Valdez-level urine spill &amp; Donnie spending all day crying in the corner #AlertTheDaycareStaff https://t.co/Nk0iUU3FIi
Sorry Bob,	It's not surprising that he doesn't know how to use a possessive apostrophe s, or understand the word "no" #AlertTheDaycareStaff https://t.co/6TMzZ1G9Id
After the Papadopoulos revelation, all daycare staff will have to go through a metal detector &amp; be subjected to a pat-down to look for wires
Hey Bob,	Do you know if there are daycare jobs in federal prisons? Asking for a friend. #AlertTheDaycareStaff #ManafortMonday #MuellerMonday https://t.co/lKh0rzExw4
Sorry Bob,	Despite all the planning, we are completely out of dry diapers. It's like a tidal wave of urine in here #AlertTheDaycareStaff https://t.co/Yz2lbNttwP
The real story turns out to be BABY MONITOR SURVEILLANCE and LEAKING DIAPERS! Find the leakers! #ManafortMonday #AlertTheDaycareStaff

To be fair Bob,	We do bribe the other children to laugh at Donnie's "hilarious" original jokes #AlerttheDaycareStaff https://t.co/vUSTwCr5h7
Sorry Bob,	@SarahHuckabee skipped her shift to practice saying this behavior is presidential with a straight face #AlerttheDaycareStaff https://t.co/7KDlMBO5Jr

Sorry Bob,	It turns of @SarahHuckabee isn't actually trying to rein in his worst impulses. https://t.co/F9cpE7PWOA

Sorry Bob	John Kelly is stuck in traffic. That's just DC is in the AM. He also had a long night after POTUS politicized the death of his son https://t.co/145vf9sp6P
It's so rewarding that our investment in LEGOs &amp; tinker toys have let Donnie explore his creative side. https://t.co/0Js71guxqx

Sorry Bob,	On the plus side, we convinced him that his "What's UpChuck?" tweet was not actually funny enough to send https://t.co/L9i3bj8djz
Sorry Bob,	Honestly, we're just happy when he doesn't cite @seanhannity as the authority on matters of great import https://t.co/GiarTJAyQv
Good news folks,	Our secret carrot &amp; stick techniques using screen time &amp; time-outs to reign in Donny remain on the DL https://t.co/s77gWLSCtY

🚨🚨🚨 All hands on deck! He has his phone again! 🚨🚨🚨 https://t.co/hz2G5M2mco

Sorry Bob,	We tried watching @TelemundoNews, but Donnie kept throwing the remote at the screen. We've gone through 6 TVs this week alone! https://t.co/zN7MrJanWa
There are no #NewTrumpHolidays at @WHadultdaycare. Taking care of this petulant septuagenarian toddle is 24/7/365
@realDonaldTrump Code red! Code red! All @WHadultdaycare staff to the White House stat!🚨 🚨🚨

After an early lunch, the POTUS is down for his nap. We're lowering the  Daycare Threat Alert Level Advisory to yellow
@realDonaldTrump Donnie, if you give us the phone back we'll give you a chocolate chip cookie 🍪 &amp; an extra half hour of TV time. Please?
