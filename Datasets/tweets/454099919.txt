For those at @CPAC worried about return of communism, remember Trump said he fell in love with the Chairman of the communist WORKERS' Party of Korea &amp; has never said a mean word about the KGB officer ruling Russia who laments the collapse the Union of Soviet SOCIALIST Republics.
But give Trump his due. In 2 short years, he has completely hijacked the Republican Party on foreign policy , undermining decades of conservative traditions regarding the importance of unity with allies, deterring dictators, and championing freedom. https://t.co/idmdJX3KRm

Fair points (though ones with which I disagree). Trump has a pattern a leaving "bad" agreements and then not replacing them. For instance, with Russians, Obama administration did not leave the flawed Moscow Treaty but negotiated a better deal, esp on inspections, in New Start. https://t.co/YykiIBIPDo

Agreed. https://t.co/ckKC5q0jwN
Trump complained at length at the cost of military exercises with our ally, South Korea. I wonder how much American taxpayer money he burned through on a deliverable-free Hanoi summit with our North Korean foe?
At his last 3 big summits -- Singapore, Helsinki, and now Hanoi -- Trump is 0 for 3 regarding deals.  Maybe time to stop scheduling these presidential summits until more progress is made by lower level officials? https://t.co/CNvvdpa0gp

When you begin your presser on your North Korean summit discussing Pakistan-India and Venezuela, you know it didn't go well.
I've organized presidential summits between Obama and Russian ledaders. To cancel a scheduled signing ceremony is extraordinary.
There are so many things wrong with the historic analogy comparing the Hanoi summit with the Reykjavik summit. Stop with that commentators please!
Trump has held three major summits -  Singapore, Helsinki, and Hanoi --with two autocratic enemies of the United States, Kim Jong Un and Putin, and struck out 3 times. Hoping 4th big summit produces better results ... any positive results!
If @realDonaldTrump achieves complete denuclearization of North Korea, I remain committed to writing a nominating letter to the Nobel committee. No need to start drafting just yet.
Summits are supposed to be action-forcing events to achieve deliverables. That fact of a meeting itself is not a deliverable.

That's my #MunichSecurityConference takeaway too. The next question is can transatlantic relations be repaired after Trump. My cautious answer is yes. Remember, we recovered from deep divides over wars in Vietnam and Iraq. https://t.co/aQSYXBAGSI

In a "race" of ground-based intermediate missiles, Russia has a huge advantage over US, in large part because Putin can put those missiles anywhere he wants; US will have to fight hard to find a place to deploy in Europe. US has major advantages at sea. https://t.co/9iumZtl49Y

But thanks @srubenfeld for asking your question &amp; allowing me to expand. Reasonable people can have different views on this issue. (I debated Treasury &amp; USTR all the time when in USG) But the only reason all these details were not in the oped is just one -- editors. https://t.co/BB3uiMSdcM
And if lifting of sanctions on Deripaska is just SOP for Treasury in this instance, why did foreign agent spend a half million dollars lobbying USG to get it done?   https://t.co/PCclUIvv3E via @OpenSecretsDC https://t.co/35CWOf9KBJ
And it is naive beyond belief to argue that this reduction in Deripaska's formal ownership will actually reduce his de facto control of these companies. (again, as if the American people should care about that issue in the first place). He also will make more money in long run. https://t.co/kxVMAcUJO7
I know the Treasury line well. But explain to me me what American national security interest was advanced by reducing Deripaska's ownership (but not control) of his companies? Sanctions are a tool to change a foreign government's behavior.  Corporate governance at RUSAL not that. https://t.co/yofrYECu0m

I agree completely that there were much better targets.  But once you have made a decision to target Deripaska's companies, you dont lift sanctions unless some American national security objective accomplished. In your opinion, how are Americans more secure by this decision? https://t.co/5ccTY6wZhk

Deripaska is smart guy who runs very complex companies. My prediction is that he will de facto maintain control over all of them, even if formally owning less of them. https://t.co/9UJ9dfnUD4
I hope reporters will track the money and tell us how much money Deripaska makes after Trump now lifted sanctions on his companies. Owning a smaller share of more valuable stocks will eventually be better than owing more of less valuable stocks.

STALIN was Hitler's ally.  The Soviet people -- soldiers and civilians alike from many ethnicities who I appreciate for their sacrifices in WWII --  had no say in that. https://t.co/8pbyMVWHWJ

@rickardtresa No, I did not.  And I dont understand your point.
Many times. See my remarks on the Battle of Stalingrad 70th anniversary back in 2013.  We owe a huge debt to the Soviet soldiers and citizens who saved the world from Hitler. https://t.co/AQBNUujwFl

Putin cancelled adoptions of Russian children by Americans in response to Obama signing the Magnitsky Act. So when Russians are discussing restarting adoptions, they are looking for a repeal of Magnitsky in return.

The Pentagon, State Department, and intelligence community all have outside advisory committees. In these times, it seems prudent for Pelosi to set up a similar group to provide strategic advice about American national security to  Congressional leadership. https://t.co/FxLugiN8ME
Maybe speaker Pelosi should establish her own national security council, a group of bipartisan foreign policy advisors that would report directly to House leadership on matters of American grand strategy (&amp; not do staff work at the committee level). https://t.co/BNet3BuFWd
The U.S. Congress must play an increasingly robust, vocal, and public role in U.S. national security starting in January. Congress has more constitutional powers to constrain presidential power than they have traditionally used. Time to step up.
In wake of Mattis exit, the excuse for working for Trump outlined in the anonymous NYT oped no longer has any validity (&amp; it didn't have much validity in the 1st place). Those who stay on now are doing so because (1) they believe in Trump, or (2) they believe in their careers.
Most senior people at the Pentagon joined the Trump administration to serve Mattis, not Trump.  Expect many to leave in coming months.

I agree with Alexey here. If this was truly offered to VVP, it exposes the amateurish ways of the Trump Organization team. But if true, it also exposes their illegal ways.

Putin should reduce probability of confrontation by stop annexing territory of neighbors or attacking their ships. I worry that a "happy talk" Trump-Putin meeting might encourage (even inadvertently) Putin to pursue more belligerent actions. That's destabilizing. https://t.co/HY230F67Tp
I disagree.  U.S. presidential meetings should be solely for the purpose of advancing American interests.  If a meeting with Putin does not serve U.S. interests -- as was the case of Helsinki last summer -- then dont have the meeting. https://t.co/HY230F67Tp

Several days ago, I was told by a well-informed Russian that the Russian government had already lined up the votes for their guy at Interpol. The surprising vote outcome today shows that public engagement on these issues can make a difference.
Russia will still try to abuse Interpol red notices and diffusions, including maybe against me.   But this was a victory for all who believe in rule of law. And the public outcry helped a great deal. https://t.co/X6KiLH7Abp

a 10 minute stop , on his way from Andrews to the White House, would have done wonders.  Remember, he has helicopters, the Beast, police escort, so the inconvenience for him is minimal.  And that flight back from Paris? He has his own suite ! Cant blame jet lag when Potus on AF1 https://t.co/LEGVRJkEno
Great point. https://t.co/sKVxCI52Kp
Im no expert, just observer, but it seems to me Dems need Pelosi for next 2 years to pull all the levers of accountability and oversight (&amp; she knows how to do that !)  to have a shot at WH in 2020.  If they win in 2020, then that might be the moment to hand over the gavel. https://t.co/6S3OPR562u
Fair point. But Pelosi just helped to deliver a major victory.  3 days before the election, I listend her walk through almost EVERY close race around the country (off the top of her head) &amp; predicted almost the exact # of flips. Candidates did the big work, but she &amp; DCCC helped. https://t.co/KLdiBij8ns

Heading over to 30 Rock to do @11thHour tonight— in the studio for a change !
Agreed.  And why do Dem calls for generational leadership change these days only focus on @NancyPelosi and not @SenSchumer ?  Im not in that chorus, but I do find this singular focus on her striking (especially after she just helped to produce victory in the House ! ) https://t.co/Z1P4yzk49z
