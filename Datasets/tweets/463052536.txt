@JamesPo94460502 @RepMikeTurner @SpeakerPelosi @SenSchumer Throwing the kitchen sink in there too huh; which has nothing to do with the shutdown. 	Anyway, my original point here was you were speaking on behalf the 800,000 people without pay, but I am one of those 800,000 families not getting a paycheck. #PelosiSchumerShutdown

@JamesPo94460502 @RepMikeTurner @SpeakerPelosi @SenSchumer End #PelosiSchumerShutdown by Pelosi staying in DC to vote and pass bills with integrity and not pettiness. Stop holding us hostage because you refuse to fund a freaking wall.
@JamesPo94460502 @SenatorTimScott No, I have the right questions to the right people. Why won't the Dems come to the table to compromise to fund the bill for my paycheck? The lack of willingness to compromise tells me how much they actually value Americans.
@JamesPo94460502 @SenatorTimScott Why are the Dems willing to compromise so I can get paid?
@JamesPo94460502 @SenatorTimScott Nope, funding the government would be perfect. Pettiness is in the details and lack of willingness to compromise. Only thing standing between me and my check is taking out one sentence in the bill pertaining to no funds to be used towards the wall with concessions made on Sat?
@JamesPo94460502 @SenatorTimScott So, that did not answer my question at all about a current, petty bill regurgitating through the House, knowing it won't pass with 800,000 of us Americans currently furloughed or forced to work without pay. When does the compromise come in to play on the Left side, now?
@JamesPo94460502 @SenatorTimScott Actually I did, but you did not like my answer. So you are saying because you agree with not needing a wall, it's ok and in good faith to present a bill knowing it will not pass the next couple of votes, just to say you are working? Knowing Americans are working without pay?
@JamesPo94460502 @SenatorTimScott I think they are petty in specifically calling out no wall knowing very well where it needs to go next to get passed. Pettiness on my dime while she sits in a mansion and travels to Hawaii when I am worried about how to pay my bills for essential work that I have to attend daily
@JamesPo94460502 @SenatorTimScott 9 Bills that serve one side's purpose. That is not compromise. We could go into the politics of Bi-Partisian voting but we all know who runs which house and can look up the few people who crossed over in the votes. Pelosi is blinded by hatred an we need to move past this.

@solanojesuss @waggytailkobe @nikkio @GOPChairwoman @realDonaldTrump For you, I would start with the Library of Congress. That will take most the items off your list above.
@solanojesuss @waggytailkobe @nikkio @GOPChairwoman @realDonaldTrump I can also give you some ideas and websites so you can actually do your own investigation in fact-checking some of your claims above. There are more reputable sites than mainstream media who like to include their opinions in their "news stories".
@solanojesuss @waggytailkobe @nikkio @GOPChairwoman @realDonaldTrump Ha! I guess 1 out of 7 isn't bad for your ridiculous reasoning. I will give you the "Mexico will pay for the wall"; however the remaining are ridiculous rhetoric. Might want to do some fact checking on the rest
@waggytailkobe @nikkio @GOPChairwoman @realDonaldTrump And where is the judgement and hatred now? Must not like mirrors much
@waggytailkobe @nikkio @GOPChairwoman @realDonaldTrump You mean like your judgemental, abusive statements of Republicans above? I read, watch, investigate, and form my own opinions especially when so many people seem to spout the same "lies" and "opinions" about one person. When it all sounds the same, there is typically one source
@MrStacyMartin @GOPChairwoman @realDonaldTrump Depends on your definition of bipartisan. To me, a few stepping over the line does not equal 9 bipartisan bills being passed. Looks like your facts are from one side of the media. Me, I like to go directly to the Congressional website to view the votes. I did this. How about u?
@solanojesuss @waggytailkobe @nikkio @GOPChairwoman @realDonaldTrump Truth comes from investigating the facts not from hate filled rhetoric and opinions. Dems also supported a wall under Obama, what's changed? Hate for one person fueled by the media pushing for politics they can control.
@waggytailkobe @nikkio @GOPChairwoman @realDonaldTrump That's a lot of hatred aimed at one person. Maybe you can put that aside to investigate who is actually fueling all that rhetoric and hatred for one person to push their own agenda.
@waggytailkobe @nikkio @GOPChairwoman @realDonaldTrump Did you think of that one yourself or get it off the nightly news? Except for the grammar issues, I believe I just saw this posted by CNN
@MrStacyMartin @GOPChairwoman @realDonaldTrump Yes, I noticed it as Pelosi left DC for vacation yesterday.....AGAIN
@CodyIsAGoodBoy @GOPChairwoman @realDonaldTrump A lot better than those vacationing in Hawaii and Puerto Rico while I am worried when my next paycheck is coming; for essential work already performed
@Dee_M_G3 @Yamiche And where is she now? On another vacation...she must be really worried about me getting paid again for work I am required to perform.
@SpeakerPelosi @realDonaldTrump We want to get paid again! Drop the freaking politics! Olive branch extended and apparently denied before even hearing it. Who's shutdown is this #PelosiSchumerShutdown 	I need to pay my bills
@Christie70C @SenatorMenendez That's ok. Those of us who need the help from not getting paid can think for ourselves instead of letting mainstream media feed us the deplorable rhetoric that tend to spew from Dems. I can see who is vacationing in Hawaii and Puerto Rico while we are forced to work with no pay.
@Jim_Jordan This shouldn't matter anymore. We need our paychecks and not to be used between parties as leverage against each other. I cannot go another two weeks without pay without being thrown out into the streets mind you still working in a mandatory position; without pay.
