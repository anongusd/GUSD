@lkmcgann Put more simply: are the different qualities that the public requires from a woman to be elected actually at odds with the qualities that make a boss good? This would be independent from sexism in the coverage of women, and probably compounds the problem.
@lkmcgann An overlooked aspect of this might be that women have to present more assertive to be elected because of sexism at the polls, so it‚Äôs actually possible that the average male senator is more laid back. Men don‚Äôt have to fight the stereotype of being weak at all times.

@TinaDesireeBerg @AmandaMarcotte I think this is akin to the # NotAllMen. I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs controversial to say Bernie‚Äôs support comes from a more male-heavy base than Dem support generally.

@ThinkMiamiBeach @JStein_WaPo @ewarren Oh gotcha! Truthfully, I think the average liberal/Democrat doesn‚Äôt understand taxes either.

@BrendanDawe @BCultice4 @JakeAnbinder I suppose the optimistic answer is supporting the collective good (see Yelp or Next Door, etc.) and the realistic answer is probably because participation is a term of either your lease or your access to the app.
@BrendanDawe @BCultice4 @JakeAnbinder You could require multiple reviews (quarterly, log maintenance requests, etc.). It doesn‚Äôt solve the problem of a single viewpoint, but it creates more datapoints over time.

@JHWeissmann More specifically, I don‚Äôt think 10% of Americans would recognize the name Piketty, but 70% support a wealth tax. 		Maybe the answer is Piketty influences the influencers, but idk if that‚Äôs more convincing than a bunch of people realizing rent is too damn expensive.
@JHWeissmann I‚Äôm interested in this take. I think there is a class of people that were hugely influenced by Piketty etc., but I don‚Äôt see a connection between graduate-level economics and polls that show 70% favoring Warren‚Äôs wealth tax.
@DanRiffle The 32 teams are also limited partners in a subsidiary org that funds loans for the teams and initiatives that benefit the member teams. It‚Äôs a pretty efficient tax and spend system.

@ThinkMiamiBeach @JStein_WaPo @ewarren The poll cites Republicans and Democrats, not liberals and conservatives.
@JStein_WaPo @ewarren To me this speaks to how uneducated the average person is about taxes. Warren‚Äôs 2% on $50M of *wealth* is a much more significant tax than 70% marginal rate on *income* over $10M, but Republicans offer greater approval.

@ThompsonFoy @shotchaser @cool_metal_dad @TheAbyssWatcher @chaddyxc @StefanMolyneux Lol. Or maybe your claim would be as valid as a supermajority of my claims. But who‚Äôs counting?
@ThompsonFoy @shotchaser @cool_metal_dad @TheAbyssWatcher @chaddyxc @StefanMolyneux That has nothing to do with the burden of proof. 		But I‚Äôm not proposing any sort of ‚Äúchange on society as it exists,‚Äù so that doesn‚Äôt apply here anyway. 		So you don‚Äôt have a source for the stat you cited?
@ThompsonFoy @shotchaser @cool_metal_dad @TheAbyssWatcher @chaddyxc @StefanMolyneux That‚Äôs not how any burden works in life or the legal system.

@ThompsonFoy @shotchaser @cool_metal_dad @TheAbyssWatcher @chaddyxc @StefanMolyneux So the absence of evidence is evidence of supermajority?
@ThompsonFoy @shotchaser @cool_metal_dad @TheAbyssWatcher @chaddyxc @StefanMolyneux Listen, you sound like you‚Äôre probably great at high school debate competitions, but claiming a supermajority of something doesn‚Äôt count for anything unless you can actually produce those figures.

@ThompsonFoy @shotchaser @cool_metal_dad @TheAbyssWatcher @chaddyxc @StefanMolyneux Ok so your point is that you can‚Äôt provide evidence to support a claim that a ‚Äúsupermajority of people from every country oppose open borders‚Äù because fewer than 50% of people think greater than 50% of media companies have a pro-open borders agenda?

@markabarger @lighthousejerry @cherry_amaretti @Jenlskelly @MikeMitchNH @JustTheFacts37 @AlecMacGillis I didn‚Äôt compare you to a slaveholder. I used popular support for slavery as an example to explain why your ‚Äúbut we voted for it‚Äù defense carries no merit.

@markabarger @lighthousejerry @cherry_amaretti @Jenlskelly @MikeMitchNH @JustTheFacts37 @AlecMacGillis I know this line about voting is important to you, but it is meaningless. People supported segregation and slavery. There were votes in some cases. They got a majority of support. You can‚Äôt seriously argue that segregation and slavery were good policy because people supported it.
@HashtagGriswold I think the argument would be to not enter two of the most densely populated metropolitan areas and instead expand to areas that have the space and ability to support workers at their new income without displacing current, low-income residents.
@markabarger @lighthousejerry @cherry_amaretti @Jenlskelly @MikeMitchNH @JustTheFacts37 @AlecMacGillis Intellectually lazy? Like not considering the practical ramifications of imposing a policy that has a disparate impact on a specific group of people, instead of supporting policy proposals that impact demographics equally across the board, regardless of motivation? Okay.

@BellTollsFor @WeWhoDieSaluteU @Patriot_Musket @PolitiBunny @womensmarch Silicon Valley to TX, as you suggest, would be even worse for conservatives electorally than any example I gave. Democrats would be gifted 38 EC votes on top of CA (55) and NY (29).

@markabarger @lighthousejerry @cherry_amaretti @Jenlskelly @MikeMitchNH @JustTheFacts37 @AlecMacGillis This doesn‚Äôt really make a good defense, Mark. Just because something is popular or has majority approval doesn‚Äôt mean it isn‚Äôt problematic.
@BellTollsFor @WeWhoDieSaluteU @Patriot_Musket @PolitiBunny @womensmarch Miami has a major presence in the financial industry. It is also home to Burger King. But I just threw out the name of a coastal population center. There wasn‚Äôt anything specific about Miami otherwise.
@markabarger @lighthousejerry @cherry_amaretti @Jenlskelly @MikeMitchNH @JustTheFacts37 @AlecMacGillis ‚ÄúQualified‚Äù in this context doesn‚Äôt really mean anything. To be eligible you need to be over 18 and a citizen, according to the Constitution. Adding things like voter ID are ways to ensure eligibility, but are not, in themselves, necessary qualifications.
@markabarger @lighthousejerry @cherry_amaretti @Jenlskelly @MikeMitchNH @JustTheFacts37 @AlecMacGillis Alright well I don‚Äôt know how to state more plainly the point that you‚Äôve been resisting. The point is that you are more bothered by the idea that one ineligible voter cast a vote than one eligible vote being prevented from voting.
@markabarger @lighthousejerry @cherry_amaretti @Jenlskelly @MikeMitchNH @JustTheFacts37 @AlecMacGillis Mark, I grew up in a staunchly conservative family. I went to business and law school and learned from many conservative professors. I don‚Äôt need some guy on the internet to open my eyes to how conservatives with or without a degree think.
@markabarger @lighthousejerry @cherry_amaretti @Jenlskelly @MikeMitchNH @JustTheFacts37 @AlecMacGillis I don‚Äôt know who you are quoting, but the quote you used seems oddly relevant, because the professor (upperclassman?) is not using language designed to shut down debate, it just does so in application‚Äîmuch like voter ID and disenfranchisement.
@markabarger @lighthousejerry @cherry_amaretti @Jenlskelly @MikeMitchNH @JustTheFacts37 @AlecMacGillis I haven‚Äôt been hiding my bias. I have also not suggested anything different from what you just said. ‚ÄúWanting to make sure voters are qualified‚Äù and ‚Äúwanting all qualified voters to vote‚Äù are very different. As you said, ‚Äúit‚Äôs not that complicated.‚Äù
@markabarger @lighthousejerry @cherry_amaretti @Jenlskelly @MikeMitchNH @JustTheFacts37 @AlecMacGillis Happy to talk, but your conjecture doesn‚Äôt really make a point, so it doesn‚Äôt really require a response.
@markabarger @lighthousejerry @cherry_amaretti @Jenlskelly @MikeMitchNH @JustTheFacts37 @AlecMacGillis Coming to vastly different conclusions about a policy that you support is not discouraging or shutting down debate.

@markabarger @lighthousejerry @cherry_amaretti @Jenlskelly @MikeMitchNH @JustTheFacts37 @AlecMacGillis Mark, a blanket denial of asylum claims is exactly what is going on right now. There was an EO within the last week that prevents the caravan from entering the US to surrender for asylum.
@markabarger @lighthousejerry @cherry_amaretti @Jenlskelly @MikeMitchNH @JustTheFacts37 @AlecMacGillis What part of the Constitution or federal law suggests people need an ID to be qualified to vote? 		I think you‚Äôve misstated the conservative goal, which would be to prevent unqualified voters from voting, not to ensure qualified voters can vote.
@markabarger @lighthousejerry @cherry_amaretti @Jenlskelly @MikeMitchNH @JustTheFacts37 @AlecMacGillis You‚Äôre confusing correlation and causation. I can‚Äôt help you with that.
@markabarger @lighthousejerry @cherry_amaretti @Jenlskelly @MikeMitchNH @JustTheFacts37 @AlecMacGillis It‚Äôs silly to think that college liberals are shutting these conversations down, because so much of college life is about positing more effective alternatives to these ideas.
@markabarger @lighthousejerry @cherry_amaretti @Jenlskelly @MikeMitchNH @JustTheFacts37 @AlecMacGillis This largely stems from the GOP ostensibly wanting to keep the bad people out and the Democrats wanting to welcome good people in. Opposition to your beliefs around immigration will mostly involve the belief that you can properly screen without forcing away many good immigrants.
@markabarger @lighthousejerry @cherry_amaretti @Jenlskelly @MikeMitchNH @JustTheFacts37 @AlecMacGillis Second, you are unlikely to find anyone that opposes ‚ÄúUS controlling its borders.‚Äù What you will find, however, are people that don‚Äôt believe a wall will be effective, or that a blanket denial of immigration right or asylum claims is the best way to accomplish our goals.
@markabarger @lighthousejerry @cherry_amaretti @Jenlskelly @MikeMitchNH @JustTheFacts37 @AlecMacGillis This would include ideas like automatic voter registration. Because the population without any form of state idea is more likely to be a minority, the policy is discriminatory in its application, even if it doesn‚Äôt say ‚Äúblack people cant vote.‚Äù
@markabarger @lighthousejerry @cherry_amaretti @Jenlskelly @MikeMitchNH @JustTheFacts37 @AlecMacGillis First, you seem to suggest that voter ID laws cannot be bad because they aren‚Äôt racist in their design. The opposition would say that it‚Äôs racist in application. They would also say there are less discriminatory ways to screen voter rolls than requiring ID.
@markabarger @lighthousejerry @cherry_amaretti @Jenlskelly @MikeMitchNH @JustTheFacts37 @AlecMacGillis Mark, you‚Äôre talking about two things that are opposed by Democrats for two very different reasons.

@Jack_Burkman Defamation is a super high bar for public figures, but malicious intent seems very plausible in a case like this.
A judge will determine if they qualify for asylum. If they do, they deserve our protection and our help, and not to me met at the border by 15,000 troops. If they do not, they can be humanely ushered through the more appropriate immigration processes available to them.
You know what would be a more efficient way to ensure a safe and legal process for the caravan? Deploying a much smaller number of troops to guide (read: *help*) the entire caravan to a port of entry, where they will surrender and declare asylum.

@mike_angarone @bennyjohnson @LouisFarrakhan It doesn‚Äôt.

Not that he is good or we should ignore when he meets with leaders.
@thiswilson @Marksw1968 @bennyjohnson @LouisFarrakhan I‚Äôm not sure I blame a 9-15 year-old in Nazi Germany for deciding to collaborate instead of being sent to a  camp, and I‚Äôm not sure I blame him for crippling industries in pursuit of money any more than other successful investors, but I‚Äôm not pretending he‚Äôs a saint, either.
@thiswilson @Marksw1968 @bennyjohnson @LouisFarrakhan That‚Äôs fair. You responded directly to my comment. I apologize for missing that. 		I stand by my statement about his wealth influencing politics. It doesn‚Äôt matter whether it‚Äôs Soros, Steyer, Bloomberg, the Mercers, the Kochs, etc.
@Marksw1968 @thiswilson @bennyjohnson @LouisFarrakhan idk what Soros‚Äô views are about Nazi Germany, but presenting the video as ‚Äúhe was a Nazi when he was a 15 year old Jewish boy in hiding‚Äù is a lot like saying a slave that didn‚Äôt actively and constantly fight their slaveholder was complicit. It‚Äôs just so far from conclusive.
@Marksw1968 @thiswilson @bennyjohnson @LouisFarrakhan No one has provided political contributions to me. 		As for Soros, I‚Äôm happy to agree that he and every other wealthy individual should not have the ability to buy influence through political contributions and spending.
@thiswilson @Marksw1968 @bennyjohnson @LouisFarrakhan I‚Äôm not sure what I‚Äôm supposed to learn from this. That billionaires have outsized influence on politics and that‚Äôs bad? That Soros doesn‚Äôt regret what he did when he was 15 and pretending not to be a Jew in Nazi Germany?		Happy to agree on more regulations on political giving.

Presenting yourself at a port of entry and declaring asylum is the appropriate legal process for asylum-seekers. It does not mean asylum will eventually be granted. 		Certainly, the President understands this very basic procedure related to one of his key political issues. https://t.co/9ll58ZMM7D

@rowland_roberto @bennyjohnson @LouisFarrakhan Roberto, I‚Äôm sure you know who he is. I do as well. But that doesn‚Äôt mean all Americans do. Many of these Americans cannot name their own elected officials or branches of government. https://t.co/ILaKupieaF

@KixerP @bennyjohnson @LouisFarrakhan I think most of my friends would recognize either his face or his name. But, like most, my group of friends is not a representative sample of America.

@scribeofsolomon @bennyjohnson @LouisFarrakhan So here is an article that should illustrate my point a bit more. As of 2014, roughly 35% of people couldn‚Äôt name either of their senators; 64% couldn‚Äôt name the three branches of govt. 		Farrakhan is not more known than your senator or the govt branches.		https://t.co/cwuhg1XONf
@DorkDude23 @bennyjohnson @LouisFarrakhan Yes I disagree that there were good people on both sides of Charlottesville. If you march with white supremacists, you are not good people.		You can‚Äôt tear down history. Even if you could, removing statues is not it, my dude.
@DavidArbogast77 @balanced123 @NateSilver538 The Constitution states that all bill regarding taxation originate in the House. The House rules state that these bills must go through Ways and Means. 		Controlling Ways and Means is arguably as important as controlling the Senate Judiciary Committee in the short run.
@Jpontasch If you want me to concede that Dems have made problematic statements at times, then yeah, they have. But the MAGA bomber didn‚Äôt have a bunch of pro-Dem propaganda on his van, and no Dem with the President‚Äôs reach is systematically using ‚Äúglobalism‚Äù and ‚ÄúSoros‚Äù as a dog whistle.
@Jpontasch I think unwillingness to simply say, ‚ÄúThose comments are bad. They cause violence. The preponderance of evidence suggests they made this violence more likely to occur,‚Äù without needing some offsetting blame on the left is disingenuous.
@Marksw1968 @bennyjohnson @LouisFarrakhan But the larger point is not that Trump was elected to support America‚Äôs goals or Soros did something, it‚Äôs that specific rhetoric is designed to mirror anti-semitic talking points.
@Marksw1968 @bennyjohnson @LouisFarrakhan If you stood on the sidewalk with a picture of Farrakhan, it would receive single-digit recognition. Even less would know that he promotes anti-semitism.

@PatrickRuffini @mattyglesias Omg he has a black friend?!?
@bennyjohnson @LouisFarrakhan So the argument here is that Democrats interacting with a bad guy who is certainly not a household name is the same as personally saying ‚Äúgood guys on both sides‚Äù, calling yourself a nationalist and deriding ‚Äúglobalism‚Äù, and regularly attacking Soros, ‚Äúinternational banks‚Äù, etc.?

@bob_wilson @karpmj Sure, but if real historians don‚Äôt correct him, how many people start believing he must be some expert because no one has an answer to all of these dumb thoughts? It‚Äôs just the question of how to cover Trump on a smaller scale.
@Jpontasch Okay, but I‚Äôm not mailing bombs or firing an AR-15 in a place of worship, so I‚Äôm not sure how that applies. 		No one is arguing there is legal responsibility, but if you think there is no moral responsibility associated with the ability to influence, then idk what to tell you.
@michellewitte @bob_wilson @karpmj @KevinMKruse The difference between letting him go unchallenged with a small platform v. correcting him w a large platform is not clear to me. Does he fizzle out on his own? Does engaging with him at all lend credibility and extend whatever relevance he has?
@michellewitte @bob_wilson @karpmj This is a delicate balance. Every time @KevinMKruse points out that D‚ÄôSouza is a hack, a certain number of people see two equal historians that just disagree politically.
@bob_wilson @karpmj In a weird way, getting dragged by real professors gives his followers the opportunity to say ‚Äúlook, they are debating.‚Äù Of course, if two people are in a debate it must mean they each have some credibility on the matter.

@dystopianexp @joshchafetz @SulomeAnderson This seems to suggest the word ‚Äúrevolution‚Äù is a dog whistle, which is a stretch, but fine.

It may be worth reflecting on why these people should not be welcomed here, where they can be safe with their family and contribute to our thriving economy.
@butch16423 @JadeRhinos @michael_w_busch @thehill I think there has been a lot of reporting that suggests the parents were misled into leaving without the children after being told by the government that their decision to waive rights to a hearing would allow them to be reunited sooner, Ruth.
@mattyglesias @NickRiccardi @RichardRubinDC Yes! If the tax strategies are legal and the income is reasonable/defensible, what is the harm in publicizing? If it‚Äôs illegal, public records decrease administrative costs by potentially outsourcing reporting. 		https://t.co/xq1vifDWQj

@DomenicoNPR Of course, Nixon‚Äôs animosity toward people of color eventually became popular knowledge when the tapes were released. 		Trump is on record suggesting black men have lower IQs and saying he is uncomfortable with them handling his money; he was sued for housing discrimination.
@DomenicoNPR Davis‚Äô embrace of Nixon, a ‚Äúlaw and order‚Äù President who was eventually ousted from the White House for crimes and other misdeeds, resulted in death threats and accusations of betrayal from the black community. He never fully recovered.
@DomenicoNPR That isn‚Äôt exactly right. Nixon, in fact, did exploit a famous black entertainer‚Äîsomeone who just wanted to be accepted and praised by the powerful. 		https://t.co/seAZjVC6gb

Interesting that @JohnCornyn and @LindseyGrahamSC couldn‚Äôt even speak for themselves when ceding time to Ms. Mitchell to question Dr. Ford on their behalf, but as soon as Dr. Ford leaves the room they start shouting in support of Judge Kavanaugh.
@FiveThirtyEight It looks like opposing party support is relatively stable, Kavanaugh excepted.
Personally, I think a BK defeat is good for republican turnout (net-net) in 2018 and a BK victory is bad, which seems to be counter the popular narrative.
@538politics 	1) is net vote gain for republicans higher if they have two justices confirmed or if they feel they were wronged and need to vote *for* a second justice.	2) is dem net greater if they are reacting to two loses or rallying around a win?	3) whats the net net for each?

That said, Kennedy should‚Äôve negotiated for Garland to replace him and then just enjoyed the show when Dems had to oppose Garland and McConnell suddenly thought Garland deserved a fair and speedy process.
If Kavanaugh is bad, he can be stopped on those ground. If he isn‚Äôt bad, then he will make a fine justice. 		I don‚Äôt see how Kennedy influence is any different from PAC or party influence, both of which are unquestionably part of selection for any president.
I don‚Äôt really see the problem here. Kennedy has a life term. If he wants to negotiate the end of that term in exchange for selecting his successor, that‚Äôs his prerogative. It‚Äôs Trumps prerogative, as the current president, to stand by the terms or nom someone else. https://t.co/G1HJwoRpbB

@AngelaL52783831 3) RBG could vacate her seat before 2020. The majority leader (as we have seen with Garland/Kennedy) can control if and when a hearing is held. 		Do you still hold the same opinion?
@AngelaL52783831 2) Majority leader controls the committees and the bills brought to vote. It‚Äôs still subject to filibuster and presidential veto, but control of the order is not worthless.
@AngelaL52783831 Okay. Then I have a few responses to that. (And I really have no interest in nominating Ted Cruz getting a lifetime appointment). 		1) Is Ted Cruz going to be worse, in your opinion, than any other Trump-approved justice?
@AngelaL52783831 His name was floated, and he made a statement that he wasn‚Äôt interested, before the Gorsuch nom. 		There is no evidence to suggest he will or won‚Äôt be considered for this vacancy. Thanks for contributing though!
@AngelaL52783831 Kennedy retired. 		If Cruz replaces him, Beto‚Äôs chances of winning in November pretty much shoot to 100%. 		Odds of Democrats getting to 51 in the Senate go up. 		So the hypo: would you trade a Justice Cruz for life for a Majority Leader Schumer for at least the next 2 years?
So is it worth putting Ted Cruz on the Court to take over the Senate?

@Jpontasch Okay. Well, I guess I‚Äôm still failing to see the market-based defense of anti-immigrant policy. Im not sure what you propose would be a more accurate way to frame the motivations behind creating camps for immigrant children. It seems the only thing put forward is ‚Äúnot racism.‚Äù
@Jpontasch The argument was the policy can be fueled by an abandonment of market principles, a staple of classic conservatism, or by racism (or both), not whatever you just suggested. Either-or statements are also not logical fallacies.
@Jpontasch I wasn‚Äôt creating a hypothetical. The theory of market economy suggests that the market will either react to excess with supply growth or demand exits. Companies will increase GDP due to labor surplus or workers will exit to address their needs. The market seeks equilibrium.
@Jpontasch It doesn‚Äôt really make sense to use illegal immigration as reference here. They create a net drag on resources because there are significant barriers to their entry into the workforce. One simple solution would be to make legal immigration more accessible.
@juliareinstein Seems like there is a prerequisite to b) that doesn‚Äôt appear great.
@Jpontasch And even this explanation offends market principles. In a true market economy, we would accept the excess that you claim, and competition would either force companies to expand to meet the excess, or any worker surplus would be forced to emigrate to satisfy their own needs.
@Jpontasch Legal immigration creates a net positive on both GDP and tax revenues. Immigrants are less likely to commit crimes than native citizens. Closing asylum ports and limiting access to legal immigration does not advance any interest in safety or economic advancement that you cite.
@Jpontasch I‚Äôm willing to consider alternatives presented. If you‚Äôd like to provide a motivation that doesn‚Äôt offend market principles or discriminate based on race, I would be happy to hear you out.
@Jpontasch I think the rest of the thread addresses the plurality of motivations and how they arrive at a common point.
@Jpontasch The two options seem to be that it‚Äôs either backed by racist intent, or it is backed by the abandonment of the long-held Republican belief in a market economy. 		In a market economy, poor people will either find a way to succeed, and improve society, or they will return home.
@jelimoore440 @E_iversonii @charliekirk11 The difference, in this case, is that legal immigrants don‚Äôt have to seek end-arounds to work.

Humans are not bargaining chips; we are not to be ‚Äúcaught and released‚Äù; we are not to be used as a deterrent for others that wish to come to the Nation of Immigrants in hopes of the American Dream. We can all be tough on crime without punishing those that wish us no harm. 10/
History may eventually conclude that these times were so violent that dramatic immigration reforms were necessary, and we were right to seek reform, but history will never look kindly on the confinement of people that have not committed actual crimes. 9/
The answer, of course, is because failing to speak up results in brown people in concentration camps, wearing barcodes, trapped in cages, and sleeping on the floor. 8/
All of this, then, leads to absolutely no incentive for a good Republican in the Senate to stand up (unless they have already announced retirement). Why risk your future when the good GOP voters, the racist GOP voters, and everything between can have the message they want? 7/
These otherwise-principled Republicans then get to throw up their hands and say ‚Äúwhat can Trump do? This is why both parties are equally the problem,‚Äù without doing further reading on DOJ policy during the Trump era or examining immigration bills stalled in the senate. 6/
The bonus layer to this is when the administration tell an easily provable lie, that this is actually a (dem) law. This is for the sliver of Republicans still holding on because of ‚Äúfiscal responsibility‚Äù or ‚Äústates‚Äô rights‚Äù that are legitimately against racism. 5/
In the end, the administration, whether through the DOJ, HHS, or the WH, gets to perfect it‚Äôs racist agenda in a way that receives the maximum support from Trump voters that want explicit racism in policy, while providing plausible deniability to supporters that aren‚Äôt racist. 4/
The problem is: the feedback look multiplies itself because it can serve as a lab for messaging. If people don‚Äôt like a comment from Sessions, Fox spins it and the WH adopts Fox. If we call Ingraham a racist for her racist statements, the WH says she has no affiliation. 3/
Meanwhile, Senate Republicans see them as two separate entities. So the veiled racism that is ‚Äúdeterrent to prevent crime‚Äù and the explicit racism that is ‚Äúsummer camps‚Äù doesn‚Äôt require pushback from the members of the party with a conscience. 2/

@matchpenalty1 @IngrahamAngle There is currently a bill in the senate with 48 D sponsors and 0 R sponsors that would prevent this type of detainment and separation. The Republicans in the senate have the opportunity to support the bill, propose another bill, or propose amendments. None has happened yet.
