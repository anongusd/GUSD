Pope Francis accepted the resignation of Cardinal Wuerl, a moment many clerical sexual abuse survivors had hoped would show the pope's commitment to holding bishops accountable. Instead Francis held him up as a model bishop, admiring his "nobility." https://t.co/0LcoN154YM
The Times asked Cardinal Wuerl  what message it sent that Francis, after accepting his resignation, had kept him in Washington despite an outcry for accountability for bishops. “Stepping aside as archbishop is an enormous and very painful step for me.” https://t.co/0LcoN154YM
Pope Francis accepted Cardinal Wuerl's resignation, but he felt bad about it. Francis sent the American off with a love letter that keeps him in place and in power. https://t.co/0LcoN154YM
After Francis accepted his resignation, Cardinal Wuerl said in an interview that he would continue to live in Washington and that he expected to keep his position in Vatican offices that exert great influence, including over the appointment of bishops. https://t.co/0LcoN154YM
Pope Francis reluctantly accepts Cardinal Wuerl's resignation but keeps him on as a caretaker in Washington. Wuerl tells us he found the pope's recognition of his effort to put his flock before himself  “very, very beautiful.”   https://t.co/0LcoN154YM

Morisi said he thought he had changed the codes to a different Adsense ID that he had requested from Google, but the older codes stuck. He said he’d change them soon.  https://t.co/BQ8ZfBLE14
This person pasted codes he had used on the Five Star fan page, as well as I’m With Putin and other conspiracy theory sites, onto the official We’re With Salvini page during “testing," Morisi said.
This person, a supportive Neapolitan who Morisi declined to name, but who wanted to help Matteo Salvini extend “southward,” was, Morisi said, a former supporter of the M5S.
After some research, Morisi discovered that the creator of an earlier site called “The South with Salvini” helped develop We’re With Salvini. https://t.co/BQ8ZfBLE14
