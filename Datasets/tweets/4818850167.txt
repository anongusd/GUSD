@darrylpetitt @Mary77700314052 @JackPosobiec Why are you laughing? People are fucking dying
@darrylpetitt @Mary77700314052 @JackPosobiec I doubt the mayor of a city was faking tears as her city lay destroyed &amp;underwater. Are you devoid of empathy? Come on man, PR is destroyed
@jeannelitz @f1c0b3a6ebb448f @JackPosobiec I‚Äôm not for spanking but rational attitude toward storm this is not about damn political parties right now
@Mary77700314052 @darrylpetitt @JackPosobiec What are water bunkers? The mayor was begging crying
@DavidCornDC @ErinJoJohnson2 Let‚Äôs talk about the people of Puerto Rico and not the so-called President. The situation is dire, Americans are dying. Ignore him
@gettinnoticedmo @ErinJoJohnson2 Let‚Äôs stop letting Donald make this about himself and his tv feud with San Juan.
@keeltyc @realDonaldTrump Let‚Äôs stop talking about the President and start taking about making sure millions of America have clean drinking water.
@pam53 @CNN @andersoncooper Of attention 3/
@pam53 @CNN @andersoncooper Not talking about the President it‚Äôs truly ridiculous&amp;absurd &amp; plays right into the President‚Äôs plan &amp; us leftists let him become center2/
@pam53 @CNN @andersoncooper I completely agree the a news anchor trying to be like nice or cute with a mayor is bad. Fuck CNN, they should be explaining situation 1/
@f1c0b3a6ebb448f @jeannelitz @JackPosobiec It‚Äôs a fair question, but something I doubt any of us here are qualified to answer. There would‚Äôve been ways to mitigate damage
@tonyposnanski @SaveMain_St @realDonaldTrump PLEASE MAKE SURE THERE IS ACCESS TO CLEAN DRINKING WATER AMERICANS ARE DYING PLEASE @FLOTUS @VP PLEASE
@JayCaruso Cult of Personality
@pam53 @POTUS We‚Äôre bridging the divide @pam53 lol
@DougHeye We have to stop talking about the incompetent president and how to help Puerto Rico. avoid him, he feeds off this.
@realDonaldTrump @ConservativeGM @realDonaldTrump PLEASE DELIVER MORE DRINKING WATER ASAP
@BNNelson74 @MalcolmNance Why is EVERYONE tweeting about the fucking idiot President and not Puerto Rico itself?This is more than a political issue &amp; im on your side
@CheriJacobus Let‚Äôs use media time to discuss crisis in PR not idiot response
RT @redsteeze: Tweeting criticisms from a luxury golf club at a mayor who is standing in rubble &amp; malaria is good optics.
@ConservativeGM @JackPosobiec But even if what I read is true it does not change the fact that Puerto Rico needs more supplies and needs infrastructure ASAP
So found some info and if that‚Äôs true they are traitors to their country in an unparalleled crisis https://t.co/gYmgVfqmRS
@ConservativeGM @JackPosobiec Hey so I‚Äôve heard this a few times on twitter can you give me link or something I‚Äôm going to look in English and Spanish sites
@Tammy_Ahmp @bozena_kania @JackPosobiec But the President of the US should not be political baiting during a national crisis/natural disaster
@pam53 But wouldn‚Äôt you agree the President should be above this in some a national crisis? This isn‚Äôt about @POTUS
@f1c0b3a6ebb448f @WPB5906 @JackPosobiec Truckers could not get to trucks and if they had trucks they couldn‚Äôt get them to distribution centers
@jeannelitz @f1c0b3a6ebb448f @JackPosobiec So I‚Äôve heard some horror stories about inland towns, death tolls are going to be so high
@pam53 We probably have a very different view of what fake news is but the focus should be on Puerto Rico not the President
@WPB5906 @f1c0b3a6ebb448f @JackPosobiec I can‚Äôt find info on that, if that‚Äôs true it sounds absolutely immoral. I‚Äôm just trying to bring attention to the situation not politicize
@darrylpetitt @JackPosobiec We‚Äôre certainly not going to agree sir. Have a good day and please support Puerto Rico if you can.
@FoxNews @Kathy4Truth This was a ridiculous segment
@darrylpetitt @JackPosobiec Ok
@FoxNews @dbongino @realDonaldTrump please Mr. President get as much of Puerto Rico as you can clean drinking water Americans are dying please @FLOTUS @VP plz
@darrylpetitt @JackPosobiec I‚Äôm talking about how Haiti got aid under Obama.
@pam53 You‚Äôre the only Trump supporter who has provided me w/ useful information about PR today, thank you. I‚Äôm just trying to spread info about PR
@darrylpetitt @JackPosobiec What does this have to do with Puerto Rico? I do not like the Clintons
@darrylpetitt @JackPosobiec This has nothing to do with the situation in Puerto Rico right now.
@darrylpetitt @JackPosobiec What does CNN have to do w/ a natural disaster?
@darrylpetitt @JackPosobiec Which is half what we gave to Haiti after the major earthquake there &amp; it‚Äôs been 10 days here. WE NEED TO DO MORE, IT‚ÄôS US CITIZENS
@darrylpetitt @JackPosobiec I‚Äôm not disagreeing with you, I‚Äôm just talking about priorities right now
@darrylpetitt @JackPosobiec I‚Äôm asking trump for help, absolutely not blaming a storm on him.
@darrylpetitt @JackPosobiec We can discuss corruption &amp; complete lack of preparation once situation is stabilized lets talk about helping PR not politics.
@FredFnChopin @JackPosobiec I will let you know when I go to PR &amp; btw love your banner photo

@Tammy_Ahmp @bozena_kania @JackPosobiec I would totally agree that the Left lets us make him the center of attention. There is an anger/obsession issue
@Tammy_Ahmp @bozena_kania @JackPosobiec He has to throw tweet bombs about media coverage let‚Äôs talk about how to help fellow Americans dying this isn‚Äôt about trump
@pam53 @JackPosobiec They absolutely do not have anywhere near enough supplies. The island was completely wiped out. The roads do have to be opened ASAP
@FredFnChopin @JackPosobiec But I totally understand asking for that and i also wouldn‚Äôt even believe a random person on twitter

@FredFnChopin @JackPosobiec as soon as possible
@mflynnJR I think it has more to do w/ the fact that residents of Puerto Rico do not have the right to vote.
