@TheNVIndy @orrinjohnson The answer is that many voters do not digest detailed policy proposals. Broad strokes are important to communicate policy proposals to a large part of the electorate. From an insider perspective, it is not ideal. But from an outsider perspective, the importance increases.

@LorneMalkiewich The U.S. Supreme Court has long struck down overly paternal statutes that arguably benefited women in ways. As an aside, if Congress reauthorizes the ERA, it would be interesting what would happen when strict scrutiny is applied rather than intermediate.
During the hearing on the ERA last session at #nvleg, I argued that the draft would already be unconstitutional the way it applies to men only via the 5th Amend. because it is based upon impermissible gender stereotypes proven false by recent conflicts. https://t.co/UnMsXTSYnu

@DDMcGrooves The better approach is reentry funds to purchase birth certificates from across the country or free birth certificates from Nevada State institutions.
@DDMcGrooves DNA and fingerprints are collected‚Äîbut the government does not have an index of every citizen to match the collection up against. Trying to tie these two systems together would not work in practice.
@DDMcGrooves Not every case has these same elements of proof and the information on a birth certificate is not proven before a jury. I get the point that you are making‚Äîbut date of birth is not put before a jury and identity is not contested in most cases. Most plea out.
@DDMcGrooves Even for non-real IDs, certain documents are needed‚Äîlike a birth certificate. For both types of IDs, it‚Äôs usually the stumbling block for inmates.

@dronelaws Yes, and exemptions for companies similar to the one I created in Nevada to more-narrowly focus the legislation on actors i consider to be more problematic. That being said, a clear altitude is far superior to leaving the property right undefined, regardless, for simplicity.
@dronelaws Anyway, it‚Äôs getting late.  As always, I appreciate the robust discussion.
@dronelaws And then, in March at ULC, you missed your chance to contribute to making uniform laws across the country because you didn‚Äôt contribute.  So much for trying to avoid the ‚Äúpatchwork‚Äù you spoke of before.
@dronelaws I was in the room at ULC in March and DJI did not offer anything.
@dronelaws You either have the worst message operation in history or you are having it both ways. You still have not expressed your position on preemption. https://t.co/omDy1aejc5
@dronelaws And here you are going against the DAC consensus: https://t.co/FyXlEY0cpi. It strikes me as trying to have your cake and eat it too.
@dronelaws DJI did not offer even these suggestions at ULC, where it could make a difference to the product you are now publicly casting doubt upon.  The rubber meets the road when it comes to hammering out specifics, which DJI has not done as well. You haven‚Äôt denied spt. for preemption...
@dronelaws You keep tearing down other ideas but you never offer your own to address state concerns (in fairness it is much easier).
@dronelaws DJI attended ULC but did not offer any real alternatives, exemptions, etc.  We added the clear altitude in NV at the REQUEST of a drone company‚Äîto make compliance easier. What altitude would you suggest is fair?  What‚Äôs your alternative?
@dronelaws Went unmentioned at NCSL was your support of federal preemption efforts.  It is very hard to have it both ways. Our constituents are not concerned about the subjects you supported, they are concerned about their privacy at home‚Äîa subject you have not come to the table about.
@dronelaws You all would be much more effective if you engaged at the state level rather than just saying no.
@dronelaws To answer my question, your company doesn‚Äôt support any regulation at State level. You would rather preempt all of our property rights.
@dronelaws Didn‚Äôt answer my question. That aside, nuisances normally do not involve physical invasions of the property of another.

@LasVegasLocally @ChangPants I hope they‚Äôre wrong.  But I feel a lot better about this rise in prices‚Äîalone‚Äîbased upon better underwriting.  We can weather it better than last time by the underwriting improving alone.
@LasVegasLocally @ChangPants When you measure everything against a 2009 recession, you‚Äôre right.  I think that we are all inherently making that comparison. But a slowdown in tourism does not a crisis make. The world was brought down by the last one, which cratered us.
@LasVegasLocally @ChangPants But what about hiring in gaming and associated support services? Just because we aren‚Äôt diversifying our economy as fast as we should (a separate important question) does not ipso facto mean that people can not afford houses. Better underwriting these days...
@LasVegasLocally @ChangPants We can‚Äôt possibly answer that question based upon anecdotes. I know that a lot of law firms are hiring attorneys though.

@HorseJeff I think you are using your political brain.  In political brain, I think folks always try to find something wrong and overthink things‚Äîand pick at it.  With sports brain and humor brain, I love it.  And hearing jets that close must have been fun for the crowd outside.

@UNLVFBSID There is probably a responding-to-@RayHagarNV division at @UNLVathletics by now, after all his tweets about @UNLV.
@Bldrlaw Sure, but people do not believe them like they used to, which is my point.  They lost their credibility to many people.
@Bldrlaw There will still be consequences for false stories, hits to credibility, etc.  Actual malice focused on suppressing stories based upon fear.
@Bldrlaw I am loathe to open up First Amendment standards during this crazy time.  It is too important overall.  I'm not a defamation atty, so IDK.
@chrisgeidner @BuzzFeedNews I hope the U.S. Attorney uses this nice admission during sentencing to show that he needs harder time to be punished.
@Bldrlaw I'm talking about the mental state required for public figures, which is high to protect freedom of speech and the press.  Mistakes happen.
@Bldrlaw Although a const. amend. would be required, I think the desire to change defamation law shows, in combination with other acts, 1A hostility.
@Bldrlaw If it is easier to sue for defamation and lowering actual malice, it has a negative effect on press freedom.
@Bldrlaw Also, you have to consider the context: the President has often remarked about wanting to change defamation law.
@Bldrlaw In that case, I hope there are also attorney's fees provisions as well if the subpoenas are quashed.
@Bldrlaw Although, I did not take it the same way as you because DOJ issued press subpoenas apparently.
@Bldrlaw I agree that there is little, if any right, to leak, as opposed to freedom of the press.  Still, we do need whistleblowers for illegal acts.

@MossPhotography I'm for education.  But education doesn't always take care of every valid issue.  Would be happy to chat more later.
@TheDroneGuy @MossPhotography understand some have treated your industry poorly and not communicated.  Not defending those people.
@TheDroneGuy @MossPhotography not always.  &amp; laws shouldn't be drafted to be too general: more certainty is better about what's roped in.
@MossPhotography @TheDroneGuy I've found that some UAS advocates turn to personal attacks.  Not productive.  People have valid concerns.
@TheDroneGuy @MossPhotography I will certainly submit to a huge grey area there.  No question.  I appreciate the discussion. Say hi in Vegas
@MossPhotography @TheDroneGuy if you fly close to people's property, you will lose public support of our constituents.
@MossPhotography @TheDroneGuy at some level it should but shouldn't be 5 feet above someone's property. The question for me: what altitude.
@TheDroneGuy irresponsible operators, excuse the typos
@MossPhotography @TheDroneGuy  just because we don't agree, you shouldn't assume I'm not educated
@TheDroneGuy enforce
@TheDroneGuy i see your point.  But if you get rid of our ability to help the FAA and force, that operators will hurt the industry as well
@MossPhotography @TheDroneGuy trespassing, for one.  Preemption amendment would have prevented trespassing suits...not in savings clause.
@MossPhotography and the FAA does not have the tools to enforce nor the manpower
@MossPhotography irresponsible operators.  I fully recognize there are many good operators.
@TheDroneGuy that said, w/the way Congress works (or doesn't) now, states could be a valuable partner for the industry if we communicate.
@MossPhotography I'm not going to split hairs over the differences between models. States have valid concerns w/ easily-accessible models.
@TheDroneGuy better than litigating...
@TheDroneGuy I agree that some areas should be preempted; instead of preemption that goes broad and far, states/industry should work it out.
@MossPhotography @TheDroneGuy well, for one, I can go to the store and purchase UAS now.  And afford it.
@MossPhotography @TheDroneGuy I will take a look at it &amp; would still submit it is less risky and costly to fly UAS for individuals aka ease.
@TheDroneGuy easier for you to just abrogate the police power of the states, sure, but the FAA will not be able to enforce w/o state buy in.
@TheDroneGuy you don't need to preempt everything to get "uniform."
@TheDroneGuy we should all recognize that UAS reg is inherently different due to ease of entry to pilots: new ST/fed framework needed.
