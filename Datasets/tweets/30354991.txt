The LIFT Act will help lift nine million Americans out of poverty. 	https://t.co/mOAXYjZdcy
Adding a citizenship question to the census is nothing more than a blatant attempt to scare immigrant communities. We cannot stand for it. That‚Äôs why I reintroduced the Every Person Counts Act with my colleagues to ensure the integrity of the census is protected.
Lynching is a dark and despicable part of our nation‚Äôs history, yet it is still not a federal hate crime. Passing a federal anti-lynching law must be a priority for this new Congress.
There are too many parents that are grieving the loss of their children from gun violence, too many communities torn apart, mourning lives that should never have been taken. It‚Äôs time Congress acted by passing reasonable gun safety reforms, like universal background checks.
Big pharmaceutical companies have unleashed an opioid crisis from the California coast to the mountains of West Virginia. Once and for all, we must call drug addiction what it is: a national public health emergency.

Access to health care shouldn‚Äôt be a privilege, it should be a right. When my mother passed away, she had the benefit of having Medicare, but not everybody does. Too many people are dying because they can‚Äôt afford medical care. That‚Äôs inhumane and why I support Medicare for All.

Let‚Äôs speak the truth that too many unarmed black men and women are killed. And too many Black and brown Americans are locked up. From mass incarceration to cash bail to policing, our criminal justice system needs drastic repair.
Climate change is real and it‚Äôs happening now. From wildfires in the west to hurricanes in the east to floods and droughts in America‚Äôs heartland, we must speak this truth based on science fact, not science fiction.
Our economy isn‚Äôt working for working people. The cost of living is going up, but paychecks aren‚Äôt keeping up. People are drowning in debt. For the first time, we have a whole generation of Americans living with the sinking belief that they may not do as well as their parents.
When American families are living paycheck to paycheck, what is this Administration‚Äôs response? They tried to take away health insurance from millions, gave away a trillion $ to the biggest corporations in America &amp; tried to blame immigrants as the source of our economic woes.
We have leaders who lie, bully, attack a free press, and undermine our democratic institutions. We‚Äôve had children in cages crying for their mothers and fathers. We have leaders who attack public schools and vilify public school teachers. That‚Äôs not our America.
The American Dream and our American democracy are under attack and on the line like never before. We must answer a fundamental question: who are we as Americans? So, let‚Äôs answer that question. To the world. To each other. Right here. Right now.		America, we are better than this.
The last couple of years, ‚ÄòFor The People‚Äô has meant fighting to hold this Administration accountable, and in that battle, I‚Äôve seen the spirit of the American people. We‚Äôve won and we‚Äôve lost ‚Äî but we‚Äôve never stopped fighting.
‚ÄòFor The People‚Äô meant fighting for middle-class families who had been defrauded by banks and lost their homes in the Great Recession. We went after the five biggest banks in the U.S. and won $20B for CA homeowners and passed the strongest anti-foreclosure laws in the country.

Today marks the second time that nearly 800,000 federal workers won‚Äôt receive their paycheck. They're being forced to choose between necessities like food, chemotherapy, or car payments or paying rent on time for the month. This shutdown is indefensible.
This has never been about keeping the American people safe with a wall. It is about the President pushing his own self-interest no matter who‚Äôs hurt in the process. This shutdown should‚Äôve never happened.

Our economy isn‚Äôt working for working people. I‚Äôve met too many folks who are working two or three jobs just to pay the bills and make ends meet. Congress must pass the Rent Relief Act and LIFT Act to give families a break.
The Republican-controlled Senate passed a clean bill to fund the government back in December. Today, they rejected an almost identical bill. This historic shutdown is unconscionable. Open the government.
Schools. Movie theaters. Banks. Places of worship. No matter where you are, you deserve to feel safe from gun violence. Mass shootings that barely make the headlines cannot become our new reality. We must pass universal background checks and ban assault weapons.
The government has been shut down for 34 days. Coast Guard employees, TSA workers, Forest Service firefighters, and more are waiting for Congress to act. Time to pass a clean bill, end this shutdown, and get these workers paid.

Reason #21 why you should vote: your vote matters.
Reason #20 why you should vote: workers shouldn‚Äôt have to choose between earning a paycheck and spending time with their newborn or taking care of a sick family member. It‚Äôs time for paid family and sick leave policies.
Reason #19 why you should vote: so immigrants aren‚Äôt forced into the shadows. We are a stronger nation because of our diversity.
Reason #18 why you should vote: to elect a Congress that will pass legislation to protect Dreamers. They are Americans in every way except on paper. It‚Äôs time we honor our promise to them and give them a permanent solution so they can live up to their full potential.
Reason #17 why you should vote: so violence against women and children is taken more seriously everywhere ‚Äî from the courts to Congress.
Reason #16 why you should vote: to elect leaders on November 6 who will address the affordable housing crisis.
Reason #15 why you should vote: to raise the federal minimum wage. With costs of living skyrocketing, you can‚Äôt live off of $7.25 an hour. It‚Äôs time to raise the federal minimum wage to $15 an hour.
Reason #14 why you should vote: LGBTQ rights. No one should be denied work, service, a place to live, or the opportunity to serve their country because of who they are or who they love.
Reason #13 why you should vote: campaign finance reform. Special interests and large corporations have spent millions to buy elections. It‚Äôs time to get big money out of politics.
Reason #12 why you should vote: to elect politicians who will help provide teachers with the tools and resources they need to do their job ‚Äî educating our students.
Reason #11 why you should vote: to strengthen Social Security and Medicare. Every American deserves the ability to retire with dignity.
Reason #10 why you should vote: so our nation‚Äôs daughters grow up knowing their work is worth just as much as our sons. We need to make equal pay for equal work a reality.
Reason #9 why you should vote: for criminal justice reform. One of the first steps to reforming our broken criminal justice system is by replacing our bail system.
Reason #8 why you should vote: to keep families together.
Reason #7 why you should vote: to ensure that everyone has the ability to breathe clean air and live in a safe and healthy environment.
Reason #6 why you should vote: to decriminalize marijuana at the federal level. Too many lives have been ruined because of our regressive policies.
Reason #5 why you should vote: to protect Roe v. Wade.
Reason #4 why you should vote: so we can create a future where everyone in America can go to college without being weighed down by mountains of debt.
Reason #3 why you should vote: Medicare for All. Quality, affordable health care should be a right for all Americans, not a privilege for the few.
Reason #2 why you should vote: to elect leaders who will work to protect our children from gun violence in schools.
With 21 days to go until Election Day, here are 21 reasons why you should vote for Democrats. 		Reason #1: to create a better and brighter future for the next generation.

The WH didn't permit the FBI to investigate the dishonest testimony of Kavanaugh. They didn't interview:	‚ÄîFormer FBI agent who administered the polygraph	‚ÄîDr. Ford‚Äôs husband &amp; friends she told	‚ÄîKavanaugh‚Äôs Yale roommate	‚ÄîDr. Ford 	‚ÄîKavanaugh 		This wasn't a search for the truth.
Kavanaugh has made it very clear to the American people that he is biased and perceives things through the lens of a partisan operative. When the issues got hot, the veneer was stripped away and Kavanaugh showed us who he really is.
The minimum standard for a SCOTUS nominee should be someone who demonstrates impartiality, integrity, and truthfulness ‚Äî Kavanaugh hasn‚Äôt demonstrated those qualities. Every American is entitled to the benefit of the doubt, but nobody is entitled to a seat on the Supreme Court.
It doesn‚Äôt matter your race, age, gender, income ‚Äî sexual assault affects everyone. This is a conversation we need to keep having and we need to take seriously.
To all survivors of sexual assault: We hear you. We see you. We will give you dignity. Don't let this process bully you into silence.
This was not a search for the truth. According to media reports, more than 40 people are willing to share their information about Kavanaugh and Dr. Ford. They only interviewed nine. This is a travesty.
63% of sexual assaults are not reported to the police in our country. Many go unreported. Some don't tell anyone. This is an issue that impacts so many Americans. Dr. Ford's experience is no different than the majority of sexual assault victims.
This should have been a search for the truth. The FBI should have been allowed to do their job. Instead, the White House did not allow it. This was about politics and raw power to push through an unfit nominee.
BREAKING: There are now 30 hours until a final vote on Judge Kavanaugh‚Äôs nomination to the Supreme Court. Don‚Äôt stop calling your senators and telling them to vote NO. Keep up the fight.

I wouldn‚Äôt be part of Kavanaugh‚Äôs confirmation hearings had Chief Justice Warren not been on the Supreme Court to lead the unanimous decision in Brown v. Board. Had someone else been there, I may not have become a U.S. Senator.		I know the impact one Justice can have.

Obergefell v. Hodges legalized same-sex marriage across the country and was one of the great moments in the history of the Supreme Court. Despite repeated questioning, Kavanaugh refused to say it was correctly decided. https://t.co/SgNWxJ0ob9
Kavanaugh continues to refuse to answer Kamala‚Äôs questions. This time he refused to state whether Congress can ban abortions after 20 weeks or whether a state can outlaw common types of abortions.
Kavanaugh refused to answer Kamala‚Äôs question about whether the Supreme Court decision to make gay marriage legal was correctly decided.
Kamala asked Judge Kavanaugh if he would recuse himself should any of the president‚Äôs civil or criminal investigations reach the Supreme Court.		He refused to do so.
My colleague Senator Blumenthal asked Kavanaugh earlier if a judge should be attacked, as our president has done repeatedly, because of their heritage and race.		He refused to answer the question. That's not a hard one.
Make no mistake, the most critical legal cases could be decided by Judge Kavanaugh, including:	‚Üí Access to health care and contraception	‚Üí Money in politics	‚Üí LGBT rights	‚Üí Voting rights	‚Üí Executive power		Call your Senators and tell them to vote NO: (202) 224-3121.
From Parkland to Las Vegas to Jacksonville, FL, our nation has experienced too many horrific mass shootings. Yet Kavanaugh has gone further than the Supreme Court and written that assault weapons and high-capacity magazines cannot be banned under the Second Amendment.

Yesterday I asked Kavanaugh whether or not he believed Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act ‚Äî which prohibits state and local voting laws that discriminate on the basis of race or color‚Äî was constitutional. 		He refused to answer.
There's a lot going on today, but this remains a human rights abuse and we cannot let it go unnoticed.	https://t.co/VqY5k8or8u

Senator Harris asked Kavanaugh about the white supremacist rally in Charlottesville last year, and whether he believes there was blame on both sides.		He refused to answer the question.
When we talk about our nation‚Äôs highest court, we‚Äôre talking about the impact that one individual on that Court can have. Impact on people you will never meet and whose names you will never know. Each justice matters. 		I‚Äôll be questioning Kavanaugh tonight around 9 p.m. ET.

Kavanaugh has carried out a deeply conservative, partisan agenda as a judge ‚Äî favoring big business over ordinary Americans, polluters over clean air and water, and the powerful over the vulnerable. He is a threat to our future.
Americans have a right to know who Kavanaugh is. https://t.co/5fMDxBG9yz
Don‚Äôt forget: Just last year, Kavanaugh praised the dissent in Roe v. Wade and ruled against a scared, 17-year-old young woman seeking to end her pregnancy. This is what‚Äôs at stake.
Whether a person can exercise their constitutional right to cast a ballot.	Whether a LGBTQ worker is treated with dignity, or treated as a second-class citizen.	Whether a President will be held accountable or is above the law‚Äî		All of this may come down to Judge Kavanaugh‚Äôs vote.

Kavanaugh would have a direct impact on the air our children breathe, voting rights, and whether millions of Americans have access to health care. He is a threat to our future and our children‚Äôs future.
This hearing is about who will sit in a house that symbolizes our system of justice in this country. Let your Senators know that you think Americans deserves a fair process and complete accounting of Kavanaugh‚Äôs record: (202) 224-3121.
Had Chief Justice Earl Warren not been on the Supreme Court to lead the unanimous decision in Brown v. Board, I may not have had the opportunities that allowed me to become a lawyer. I almost certainly would not be a U.S. Senator. One Justice can make an impact on our lives.
Kavanaugh has gone further than the Supreme Court and written that because assault weapons are in ‚Äúcommon use,‚Äù they cannot be banned under the Second Amendment.
Judge Kavanaugh told me in my office that rushed decisions are often bad decisions.		I agree with him, especially when we‚Äôre picking a lifetime appointment to the Supreme Court.
I would think anyone who wanted to sit on the nation‚Äôs highest court would be proud of their record and want the American people to see that record ‚Äî not be confirmed shrouded by uncertainty, suspicion, concealment, and doubt.	 	We should not be moving forward with this hearing.

It‚Äôs outrageous that the GOP dumped over 40,000 pages of documents the eve before Kavanaugh‚Äôs hearings began. https://t.co/3982w0lLzw
42,000 pages of additional Kavanaugh documents were given to the U.S. Senate last night. These documents likely further show his extreme positions on women‚Äôs rights, gun safety, and more. 		Chairman Grassley is pushing forward with the hearing anyway.
There are 6-7 million pages of documents related to Kavanaugh. The Chairman has requested only 10-15% of those.		This is a hearing about who will sit on the highest court on our land. There must be due process and transparency in that process. Let's postpone this hearing.
The truth is Republicans are rushing through this hearing because Kavanaugh is the least popular nominee in decades and the more the public learns about his record, the less they want him confirmed to the highest court in the land.
This hearing has been dangerously rushed. 42,000 documents were released to us just hours ago. Hundreds of thousands are being withheld or blocked. What are they hiding? Why the rush? This is outrageous.
More than 42,000 pages of Kavanaugh documents were released to the committee just HOURS before the hearing. None of them have been made public. We need time to review those documents. This is wrong.
I objected to moving forward with the Kavanaugh hearing because this process has not been transparent or fair. These hearings should be delayed now.
Last night ‚Äî hours before Kavanaugh‚Äôs confirmation hearings were set to begin ‚Äî Republicans dumped 42,000 pages of additional documents on the US Senate.		No one would be able to review those records before the hearings began. This is intentional. We cannot possibly move forward.

A few weeks ago, I introduced the Rent Relief Act, which would ensure families earning up to $100k don‚Äôt pay more than 30% of their income on rent. With rising rents and stagnant wages, this bill will keep money in hardworking families‚Äô pockets and a roof over their heads.

Bayard Rustin, an openly gay man, was the chief organizer of the March on Washington. Dr. King‚Äôs had full confidence in Rustin -- and it led him to organize one of the most well-attended marches in our nation‚Äôs history. https://t.co/P5XJyscXai

It's alarming the U.S. is one of just 13 countries where the rate of maternal mortality is higher than 25 years ago. And we must acknowledge the risk of death for Black women from pregnancy-related causes is 3-4x higher than white women in America. It is a public health crisis.

My message to women in America &amp; those who care about women: pay close attention to this Supreme Court battle. Trump made it clear that his litmus test for Justices would be to overturn Roe v. Wade. He presented a list of judges that met the test‚ÄîJudge Kavanaugh was on that list.

I am committed to bringing accountability, responsibility, and honesty to Wall Street, and I hope you'll stand with me in this fight.
When I was Attorney General, I saw firsthand the devastation of the financial crisis, with more than 150K CA families losing their homes to foreclosure. My team fought to make things right for them, and in 2012 we delivered a $20B settlement from the big banks to CA homeowners.

The federal minimum wage is too low to support a family. That‚Äôs why I‚Äôve supported raising the national minimum wage to $15 an hour.
Trump's decision to ban transgender Americans from serving is cruel, un-American, and not in our national interest. We should honor the courage of any individual who decides to sacrifice for our nation, not turn them away.

What the students from Stoneman Douglas High School have done has been extraordinary. They have created a movement that will culminate later this weekend during the #MarchforOurLives and will ultimately put enough pressure on Washington to act on gun violence.
Leaders from Facebook and Cambridge Analytica must appear in front of Congress to take responsibility for violating the privacy of Americans. They need to explain what happened and what steps they are taking to ensure it will never happen again.
Because our nation lacks national paid family and sick leave policies, employees can be fired for taking a day off to care for a sick child or parent. That‚Äôs not right. We need to support workers.

Dreamers are Americans in every way but on paper. Congress must do right by them. Let‚Äôs give them a path to citizenship.
Action on gun violence is not a political question ‚Äî it‚Äôs about keeping Americans safe. Here‚Äôs what we need to do to start addressing this epidemic:		‚úÖ Make background checks universal 	‚úÖ Ban assault weapons 	‚úÖ Ban bump stocks 	‚úÖ Raise the minimum age to purchase rifles
We must continue to fight to defend and expand the progress made for women‚Äôs rights and reproductive health in the face of relentless attacks.

This shutdown was avoidable. The WH created this crisis &amp; the GOP leaders in Congress refused to negotiate with Democrats. We must pass a bipartisan solution to fund the government, guarantee health care for millions of kids &amp; protect Dreamers. Americans expect &amp; deserve it.
When I see our Dreamers ‚Äî as I often do in the halls of Congress ‚Äî I know I am looking at our future. And my friends, the future is bright because of them. Let‚Äôs work to pass a bipartisan compromise to keep the government open.
History is going to show that Republicans are on the wrong side of this fight.

The facts: 	‚ÜíThe GOP has control of the House, Senate &amp; White House. 	‚ÜíTrump was the one who ended DACA &amp; opposed the bipartisan compromise brought before him.	‚ÜíThe vast majority of Americans favor protecting Dreamers, funding CHIP &amp; the government.		Let‚Äôs do those things.
We should be funding the government, reauthorizing CHIP, and protecting Dreamers from deportation.
Dreamers: I hear you, I see you, I‚Äôm with you. We won‚Äôt stop working until we have a bipartisan compromise that protects you from deportation.
Republicans control the White House, the House, AND the Senate. Yet we are inching closer and closer to a government shutdown, which would cause real hardships on families across this country, including the 140,000 federal civilian employees in CA. We need a bipartisan deal.
Since Trump arbitrarily set this DACA deadline in September, 15,500 people have lost their status. This means they cannot work and they are terrified because their future is completely unknown.
