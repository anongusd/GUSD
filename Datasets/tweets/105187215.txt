@leonardpart13 @ctvnorma @ctvlyndasteele Hey Len! Obama now has much easier path to victory. If Romney loses one Eastern state he is done.

@CTVNorma @silvesterlaw @ctvlyndasteele I just need a cool hologram map like on CNN! Thanks for the love!
@silvesterlaw @ctvnorma @ctvlyndasteele well watch Florida, if it goes blue we can count this election effectively over - 86% counted.
