Why do we not insist that our present and future POTUS, Congressmen and Supreme Court justices undergo such an obvious and minimal requirement as to be throroughtly vetted?
This should be as qualifying a requirement as age or place of birth. If we are ever again to live in law-abiding country, one not ruled by criminals like the current tRumpGOP, then we must have a mechanism to remove from gov‚Äôt service anyone who is found to be a security risk.
If red flags arise from the security clearance check, office holder must go before an impeachment board.  All low-level gov‚Äôt workers in sensitive agencies already undergo security checks before employment. Shouldn‚Äôt we require our leaders meet this minimal qualification?
Any association with foreign nationals, criminal syndicates, felons, and any legal judgements against a national office holder or seeker must be made part of their public record.
At minimum, the lesson from 2016 is that we need a law stipulating that every national office holder and seeker throughout our three branches, must pass a security clearance check.

This should be as qualifying as age or place of birth. 	We must remove from gov‚Äôt service anyone found to be a security risk, linked to organized crime or fraud.  That is if we are ever going to live in a better world, without evil, like the tRumpGOP.
If found, person must go before an impeachment board.  Even low level government workers receive a security clearance check before employment.  How in the hell do our leaders avoid this obvious and minimal requirement?
The citizenry must be notified of any involvement with foreign nationals or criminal syndicates.	All involvements in felonies, association with felons, and legal judgements must become public.
At minimum, the lesson from 2016 is a law that each and every future (and present) national office holder, throughout our 3 branches, must pass a security clearance check. https://t.co/eunhgHvBPr
