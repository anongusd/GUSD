The spending limitation for medical marijuana took 13 years to get enacted. This isn‚Äôt a slam dunk. But its chances in a House run by Democrats is more than zero. Senate gets tricky. Also there‚Äôs the fact that the DHS spending bill is, uh, problematic this approps cycle.
It wld be similar to the Rohrabacher-Farr amdmt that‚Äôs hitched a ride on fed spending bills since 2014, but that only applies to Justice Dept agencies like DEA and to states where medical cannabis is legal. So it would keep DHS from spending $ to enforce in states w/legal weed.
