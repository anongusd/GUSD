Transparency/shorter commitment periods help incentivize increased #climate ambition. Some #ParisAgreement aspects now under threat w/out US leadership. But leadership needs to be shared by actors all over the world &amp; countries are stepping up- @SelwinHart https://t.co/ilW4mtVOAT
Valerie Smith @Citi - thanks for the shout-out to @ghgprotocol ! #ClimateAction participants can learn more at https://t.co/eSR0FMfCqO
MD part of @USClimate Alliance:  bipartisan states living up to #ParisAgreement. MD in Transportation &amp; Climate Init. Need to look at #ghgemissions from transport. Power of collaboration is enormous. Broaden #RGGI model to other sectors - Ben Grumbles https://t.co/ilW4mtVOAT
Funding: 80% financing goes to #ghgemissions and 20% to adaptation. Green Climate Fund seeks 50/50 split. MDBs IMDBs need to work harder on making greater financing available for adaptation. Impact of #GCFund is game changing - @SelwinHart https://t.co/ilW4mtVOAT

Uncertainty of #CleanPowerPlan at federal level. Was stayed at state level and all our VA biz constituents said they wanted it to continue.  Gov. Northram continued on regulatory path begun under Gov. McAuliffe - Angela Navarro #climateaction https://t.co/ilW4mtVOAT
A day after Trump announced withdrawal from #ParisAgreement, 9 diverse states agreed to extend #RGGI program beyond 2030. States in the U.S. are moving forward on #climateaction and reducing #ghgemissions and benefitting their citizens  - Ben Grumbles https://t.co/ilW4mtVOAT
#Biz would appreciate consistency of a strong regulatory program rather than bits &amp; pieces across US.  States have to be beholden to our constituents &amp; a significant factor is #climateaction - #transportation, #cleanenergy #resilience etc. - Angela Navarro https://t.co/ilW4mtVOAT
Nothing more practical than preserving health and beauty by protecting our natural resources. States are united to address #climateaction - think globally, act locally and invest locally - Ben Grumbles https://t.co/ilW4mtVOAT #WeAreStillIn

For us, #climatechange is not some esoteric issue. For us it is real. It has real loss of life implications. We need US back at the table; however, we aren't going to stop taking #climateaction. W/out US.leadership we would not have had the ambitious #ParisAgreement - @SelwinHart
Countries extended themselves for #ParisAgreement. They saw it was big moment. US walking arm-in-arm w China. Having done that, US turns around and says "nevermind" - very damaging. Countries still in, but don't underestimate damage @tsterndc https://t.co/ilW4mtVOAT #climataction
