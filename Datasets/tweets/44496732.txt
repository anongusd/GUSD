@mrbdj95 @WWLTV This is concerning Shantel Wagner, the woman accused of shooting and killing her husband who is a sheriff‚Äôs deputy.
BREAKING: Judge has decided to reduce the bond to $300,00 with the requirement of home incarceration and GPS monitoring. Will only allow her to leave to go to the doctor's office for medical treatment. @WWLTV
Defense: We have eyewitness testimony that his mannerisms that night were erratic.  Still insist that he shot himself.
State: Feels that she could flee. Requesting bond not to be reduced.
State: That bond that she has is NO different that any other defendant charged with second degree murder! She's no different from anyone else, just because she doesn't have a criminal record.
Palazoo: She's not a flight risk, she's not a harm to anyone else. Asking the court for $100,000 bond. Put a band around her ankle. State rejects to any reduction in bond, which is currently $500,000.
Judge believes it holds as probable cause. Now discussing bond reduction.
State: It was an intentional act.
State: Want to make sure the court is very clear that Wagner told a witness that she shot her husband.
State: "Every statement that she has made (Wagner) has been inconsistent."
State: "There are multiple things listed in the affidavit."
Palazzo: "They didn't meet their burden!"
Defense Attorney Palazzo: "There is no probable cause for second degree murder!! At all!!"
Just concluded testimony Defense now closing.
Scanlan: Just from preliminary starting reconstruction., I know that it was from right to left and upward.
Defense: Asking if the wound was from right to left, front to back. Scanlan: I'd refer to the pathologist.
Now on the stand: Chief Deputy Scanlan. Scanlan says he is currently in the process of doing reconstruction on the crime scene.

Richoux: He makes a fluid premeditated movement towards Officer Holloway, and shoots him.
Dr. Richoux discusses the day of the murder. Says after reviewing the evidence/audio tapes, there's no way that Boys actions that day indicate he was mentally unstable or psychotic.
