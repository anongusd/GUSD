In fact: This is the exact kind of thing that could have helped my brother Eamon get the treatment he needed to recover. He had to wait 10 weeks after detox to get access to rehab services because of "not enough beds." THIS BILL FIXES THAT.
For anyone who says the House opioid bills are "insignificant" or "don't go far enough" -- you are very wrong. This is a bill THAT WILL SAVE LIVES.

And honestly – I miss my brother every single day of my life and think of him endlessly. He was a solid dude. He was my broseph. He was one-of-a-kind and my family only had 28 years with him. It will never be enough. https://t.co/4WTdGqClRn
There is a deafening silence and stigma about addiction, disease, and mental health in America that is killing people. It is not easy to talk about darkness but asking for help can save lives. Eamon is the reality of the #crisisnextdoor.
Eamon was smart, hilarious, unshakably loyal, and had a gift for picking on me as his little sister that will never be seen again in this lifetime. He was more than his addiction. He was more than his death. He was, is, and will always be my big brother. https://t.co/tCW6hYsjmw
The #opioidcrisis is personal. Two years ago today, my brother Eamon Eric Callanan died of an #opioid overdose. The world changed forever with the loss of his incredible soul. To know Eamon was a gift and to be his sister was my greatest gift. No family should face this grief. https://t.co/wuQuWVk6Zi
Next week, the House will bring a slate of bills to the floor to fight the #opioidcrisis and work to make sure no other family ever has to lose a loved one.

While the tax code is reformed — the IRS remains in need of serious redesign. Not only should it be committed to customer service but customer security as well. Today the IRS struggles with both. This week the House is working to change that.
.@RepDavidYoung's Justice for Victims of IRS Scams and Identity Theft Act of 2018 (H.R. 2905) requires the attorney general and treasury secretary to create and submit reports to Congress about identity theft across the United States specifically about tax scams.
.@RepJeffDenham's Moving Americans Privacy Protection Act (H.R. 4403). This bill would require that @CBP remove personally identifiable information from info transmitted to third party.
[THREAD] IRS redesign and reform on the House floor today --&gt; https://t.co/auhANL1Bje
Likewise, @RepMikeBishop's, R-Mich., 21st Century IRS Act requires the IRS to improve cybersecurity and identity protection, especially to stop tax refund fraud, and allows more people to file online, including with debit or credit cards.
The Taxpayer First Act authored by @RepLynnJenkins, R-Kan., orders the IRS to restructure to fit our new, simplified tax code, demands better customer service from our nation's tax collectors, and institutes reforms to avoid mistreatment of taxpayers and needless tax litigation.

@GOPLeader I put my hope in the American people. This bill puts our hope in the American people. Because when you trust the people, that’s the start of America’s comeback.
@GOPLeader To those struggling to keep your small business afloat, to pay your employees and give back to your neighborhood, this is your comeback.
@GOPLeader To those trying to find a job, the long search is coming to an end. This bill is your comeback. To those sick of scraping by and fighting for a raise, this is your comeback.
@GOPLeader My friends on the other side of the aisle have the audacity to call this a tax hike? In the end, what they’re defending is the broken status quo.
@GOPLeader Now, I’ve tried my best to understand their opposition, and I’ve listened to the pessimistic leaders of a party that, once upon a time, claimed to stand for the common man. Without a shred of evidence, they are certain our plan won’t work.
@GOPLeader Every honest person sees this is a tax cut for hardworking Americans.
@GOPLeader This bill increases the child tax credit, increases the standard deduction, increases wage, and brings back jobs. The fact is, the first $55,000 an average family of four earns won’t face a single penny of income tax. Not a single penny!
@GOPLeader I think that voting ‘no’ on a plan with lower taxes, higher wages, more jobs, and a simpler system, that isn’t about Republicans and Democrats. Voting ‘no’ is telling the American people you do not have faith in them to rise if they’re given a fair shot.
