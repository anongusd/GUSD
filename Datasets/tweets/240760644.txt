@TomJenneyAFP, dental therapists are not equivalent to physician assistants.  Drilling and tooth extraction is surgery. No Med midlevel does surgery. This population of tribes and veterans deserve quality care not ‚Äúany half assed care.‚Äù Agree to disagree on this.
@TomJenneyAFP, my conservative street cred is beyond dispute. It‚Äôs not a ‚Äúconservative‚Äù or ‚Äúliberal‚Äù issue regarding dental therapists.  It‚Äôs a public health and safety issue. The dentists want highest quality dental care which comes with years of education. https://t.co/aHz1uhvOAf
