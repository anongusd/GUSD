This #WomensHistoryMonth, let us recognize the history being made by the record number of women serving in Congress today.		"At present, our country needs women's idealism and determination, perhaps more in politics than anywhere else." -Shirley Chisholm

Katherine Johnson, Dr. Christine Darden, Dorothy Vaughan, Mary Jackson, and all the women of NASA were pioneers. The success of the NASA space program is due in large part to their brilliance, hard work, and perseverance in the face of adversity. #HiddenFigures https://t.co/KQ3T2BZ9Jx
Yesterday, Congress took an historic first step in our battle to #EndGunViolence. I was proud to vote yes on #HR8 to implement universal background checks on all gun sales. We won't rest until our communities are safe from senseless gun violence.	https://t.co/cog9Stw4si
I was elected last November to provide a check on President Trump and put my constituents and the Constitution first. In fulfilling this solemn duty, tonight I voted in favor to terminate President Trump’s improper national emergency declaration. https://t.co/HtLwrH8hPL

Pres. Trump declaring a national emergency to build his wall is an attempt to circumvent Congress' constitutional authority. He needs to get in line with the vast majority of Americans who understand that what is occurring at the southern border is not a national emergency.
No one knows the true pain of losing a child to gun violence like those who have themselves gone through the tragedy.

Here's my full statement on the #TrumpShutdown:	https://t.co/csmYaSytfF
Democrats presented Pres. Trump with a simple proposal days ago: keep the government funded through a bipartisan plan that provided more than $1 billion for border security. Pres. Trump instead chose an unattainable, irresponsible $5 billion wall over the American people.
House Democrats and Senators from both parties are ready to keep the government open. The Senate has already voted to do so. If the government does indeed shutdown it will be because POTUS rejected a bipartisan deal. #TrumpShutdown

#SCOTUS ensured African Americans the right to vote &amp; an equal education, ensured LGBTQ Americans the right to marry, and women the constitutional right to make their own healthcare choices. It will be tarnished as long as Judge Kavanaugh serves on it. This is wrong.
Nothing compels @senjudiciary to continue to so recklessly force Judge Kavanaugh's nomination forward. A third credible allegation only provides more credence to stop all proceedings and allow @FBI to investigate. Tomorrow's hearing  must be postponed.

Any attempt by Pres. Trump at intimidating Rod Rosenstein, either during or after their meeting on Thursday, cannot be tolerated. The DOJ’s independence is critical to maintaining the rule of law, and Dir. Mueller’s investigation must proceeded unimpeded.
I support Sen. Feinstein’s call to halt Judge Kavanaugh’s nomination until the FBI can investigate both credible allegations against him. No single nominee should be confirmed to #SCOTUS with so many red flags.

Thank you to @ACBiH, .@EliKula, and Munira Subasic for a successful #BosnianWomensDay 		#Genocide #Prevention https://t.co/RTXMfz9Ve1
When doves cry .....
#BosnianWomensDay has come to an end.  It was a powerful reminder of the importance of #Genocide #Prevention
.@EliKula: "A lot of the youth want to leave #Bosnia. Brain drain is a problem." #BosnianWomensDay
.@EliKula: "Children in #Bosnia are willing to listen, but not yet to totally accept the truth about the #bosniawar
.@EliKula: "#Syria should involve more women in the reconciliation process than Bosnia did." #BosnianWomensDay
Advice for the aftermath of the war in #Syria from Murina: "Do not divide the country into enclaves after the war." #BosnianWomensDay
.@EliKuna: "Ask our politicians to agree to deals that include long-term goals, and we must work with locals." #BosnianWomensDay
.@EliKuna: "Politicians will always use nationalist rhetoric when trying to get elected, but education is key for reconciliation."
.@EliKuna: "Our children are learning three different versions of history, and that focus in education in #bosnia is what we need most."
.@EliKuna: "I do not think that we yet have embarked on reconciliation...what we do need is education."
Murina: "No one in Bosnia is working on trust." #BosnianWomensDay
Answer from Murina: "Not as long as politicians and public figures keep making public statements denying what happened."
Q1: "Given the amount of #GenocideDenial in Bosnia and Herzegovina, what will it take to have reconciliation?" #BosnianWomensDay
I remember the conversation I had with @EliKula that created #BosnianWomensDay, and with it, a space to talk about #genocide #prevention
.@EliKula: "We have a serious problem processing war crimes in Bosnia and Herzegovina." #BosnianWomensDay
.@EliKula: "We cannot expect victims of the #genocide to be the first people to reach out for the reconciliation process."
.@EliKula: "As long as we hold on to the past and teach people about it, we can embrace it and move forward."
.@EliKula begins her words
Mu Di is a refugee who sits on the Dallas Youth Commission to advise Dallas’ City Council on her experience #WWWP https://t.co/eE81RLTEBc
Munira: "Every victim deserves to be properly buried." #BosnianWomensDay
Munira: "I would like to thank the American government for its role in the search parties." #BosnianWomensDay
Munira: "We do not have a law prohibiting the denial of genocide, and the world should help us create one."
So sad to hear about legendary performer  #PRINCE prayers to his family and his millions of fans across the globe https://t.co/MOUUkoHXGZ
Munira: "The children who were killed had a name and a last name; and their perpetrators should now have a name and a last name."
The female population of Bosnia was ravaged by rape during the #bosniawar, and many children were born from these incidents.
The Movement of Mothers of the Srebrenica and Zepa Enclaves has sought legal remedy from the United Nations and the Neatherlands
Munira: "We, the mothers, have carried the greatest burden in Bosnia after the war...how to survive and raise our voices."
Munira Subasic: "The greatest injustice is to wait for justice, and we have been waiting for justice for 20 years."
How do #GenocideDenial and the glorification of war criminals obstruct justice in #bosnia?
In honor of #GenocideAwarenessMonth, our topics today will be #genocide #prevention
With opening remarks from Ajla Delkic from @ACBiH, the seventh #BosnianWomensDay is underway!
