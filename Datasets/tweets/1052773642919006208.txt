@DaisyJHollands Another evasive tactic. Enlighten me. It's seemingly complete bs.
@humanhere2 @INFJuxtapose By all means read my blog or watch my youtube channel. I'm obviously trolling because people are politically correct snowflakes and it is a result of universities, over-protective parenting and left-wing idiocy.
@hayxsmith I've read over 30 this year.
@INFJuxtapose Sure in answer to your first question. Yes I am an adult. Let's stay on topic although to be fair I didn't think a weak attempt at an insult deserved an actual response.
@DaisyJHollands Not harassment at all simply the truth for a person who is an actor in a movement which is not needed.
@williams1977 @INFJuxtapose Go on enlighten me on my "idiocy"? Considering you are seemingly intellectually sound.
@humanhere2 @INFJuxtapose Absolutely although I find it hilarious that people aren't open-minded enough to hear ideas/ideologies or premises which are logical. People can do what they please with their accounts. By all means block away if you want to remain in a safe space.
@DaisyJHollands Surely if it was a morally sound social movement it would have empirical evidence to back it.
@williams1977 @INFJuxtapose I'd argue Twitter actually. Considering it de-platforms people and claims to be an advocate for "free speech".
@DaisyJHollands Where's the logical argument? Where's the health benefits behind your proclaimed group? Or are you simply going to throw insults because you have NOTHING?
@INFJuxtapose are you in favour of the oppression of freedom of speech? seemingly you are.
