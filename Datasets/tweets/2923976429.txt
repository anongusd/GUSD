@Amber_Addison_ @ShannonRitenour Are you endorsing?
@BNICE80 @bugjuice717 Not ok.
@BNICE80 @bugjuice717 I never said it was mine. I just pasted it. If folks want to stress over it, that's on them. I'm just saying everyone got all worked up about it. AND I'm not a coward! I handle my self and own up to my mistakes. My point is a lot of folks got so deep into it. Even offensive.
@BNICE80 @bugjuice717 There was no author. Just a statement. There is no plagiarism. It was just a point in showing division and behaviors.
@DebonaireToast More like crumbs. By not getting what they need will eventually hurt the students and create more program cancellations and sub 2nd rate https://t.co/Kf3iJZdPdK well as increase in tuitions and other fees.
I hope this helps. The funds these HBCUs have gotten is after the 10-13%cuts. Which only hurts students. My opinion is by cuts it allows schools to fall apart and fail. Thus a quicker road to shut down. Or becomes to expensive. https://t.co/YuIDSWDA2L
@DebonaireToast However it is estimated that there is 10%and higher in cuts. What I've listed above is after the cuts.
@DebonaireToast Other schools on the list receive anywhere from $250,000 for Gadsden State Community College to $1.7 million for Stillman College. It's based on the number of students qualifying for Pell Grants, French said.
@DebonaireToast Of the 97 colleges receiving funds under the program, 15 are in Alabama. Alabama State University gets about $3.9 million, Alabama A&amp;M University gets about $3.2 million, Lawson State Community College gets about $2.99 million, and Tuskegee University gets about $2.28 million.
@DebonaireToast Department of Education announced today that 97 historically black colleges will receive $227.9 million in federal funds as part of its annual Strengthening Historically Black Colleges and Universities grant
@DebonaireToast These figures are nationally
@DebonaireToast The budget blueprint titled “America First” decreases Department of Education funding by 13 percent, leaving some programs that support minority students unfunded.		The $9 billion budget cut to the Department of Education includes a “devastating hit” for black colleges,
@DebonaireToast elimination of the $732 million Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grant (SEOG) program, which assists students in financial need. In Trump’s budget, these programs either were eliminated or reduced significantly, resulting in a loss of at least $4.8 billion.

@Cruellaisdevine @ipu_jl But it's ok. This is one main difference between us and them. They ask/beg they get it throw it at them we ask, we got to prove ourselves and beg. They get 300,000 we get 3000.00 they win we work harder to win. But it's ok if folks feel tired of us begging. It's their monies.
And that's ok. Thank you for the good wishes. https://t.co/5OFmLRA13e

I very much respected Senator McCain. Like many I was saddened by his death. He died like he did a man of strength and a hero. As I watched his funeral many things came to mind, such as the old gospel song "may the works I've done speak for me". All my life thanks to my grandmom.
There will also be free pony rides, hamburgers, hot dogs and goat stew.Sherriff Blakely said each candidate will have up to 10 minutes to speak to the attendees. When not addressing potential voters, candidates are encouraged to meet-and-greet and shake as many hands as they can.
All candidates who are on Nov 6 ballot are invited to attend a political rally. The event is set for 5-8 p.m. Saturday, Sept. 8, at the Sheriff's Rodeo Arena on Alabama 99. Live music will be provided by the Alliance Quartet and Bill and Tina Swindell and the Deep South Band.

@CaptKatyaSwann @DrVEnoch Healthcare is not a privilege. It is a right for everyone to have affordable healtcare. Its said that peoples health should be sacrificed for greedy pharms, and health insurance agencies. They are not medical or health professionals. They are about business and making money off
@CaptKatyaSwann @DrVEnoch The expansion of Medicaid and healthcare for all are 2 separate issues. Medicaid Can actually add to the economy by allowing our rural hospitals and clinics to reopen. Everyone does not qualify for Medicaid. Alabama should have taken the federal$$$ and expanded it. Big mistake!

That's all you can do. It will all work out for the best. So I say to all my followers. HELLO, MY NAME IS DEBORAH BARROS. I AM THE CANDIDATE FOR ALABAM STATE SENATE DISTRICT 7. Move over I'm coming through. I am for the family in every way. I have a mouth, a fight and passion
In spite of me I've been humbled, blessed and highly favored. I'm honored to be your servant. So if I can't raise the funds I need it's ok. I will figure it out and continue to push forward. Because it was and is my grandmother who taught me never give up. Do and be your best-
Others- things won't seem so bad. I learned that there are those who have no voice. That can't speak for themselves. Those are the ones I fight for. Now, that same strong resister who was ahead of most, my 95 year old  grandmother needs me to stand up for her.
Been mistreated etc... But no matter what has happened over the years I've grown, became stronger and used life as lessons learned. I learned to become superwoman and no matter what always took time for service. I learned no matter what you are going through- always stop and help
In my 59 years of life. I've been to he'll and back a few times. Each time I prevailed. It is not by happen stance that I am in this place I'm in. I have been a victim in my childhood and as an adult. I have recently been victimized. Iv lost a baby son to death. Lost loved ones
It was very emotional and surreal for me when years later I was one of the Alabama Coordinators for the 2016 Women's March on Washington. I have always worked in the community, in church and professionally. I have always been an advocate and a voice. I have learned many things
I believe that in order to be leaders we must first be servants. I was first indoctrinated by my grandmother to be civic and service minded when she took me to the March on Washington to hear Dr. MLK, Jr in his I HAVE A DREAM SPEECH. She taught me volunteerism at an early age.

step in and help our state, maybe. People just don't trust. We call you guys - No return calls. Questions? No response. We did not see our state leadership through the whole presidential election until she congratulated #45. Then at the State meeting she blamed the democrats for

In special elections and primaries, we are slow to donate and volunteer to GOTV. Folks we can't stop now. We must keep up the momentum. In Alabama we don't even have our state Democratic Chair trying to raise funds to halo candidates nor rally us around our candidates!
It should take more than rallying together because we don't want an alleged Pedophile. It should be because we are tired!! The Republicans are afraid and determined. They are doing their job trying to hold on because they don't want change. We say we want change but we don't vote
Well Democrats did not go to the polls. Democrats did not help financially support Terry Jones in Alabama. We did not FLIP that seat. You want us to step up and run. You want change. BUT if we can't work hard together like we did for Doug Jones it won't happen.

LETS TALK MORE ABOUT MEDICAID!! YOU ASK WHY WE RUN?		Alabama to impose work requirements for some beneficiaries https://t.co/j8VyN3iHy5 via @alreporter
Ok I lied! Lol. One more-		We should arm teachers...with livable wages, safer classrooms, better funding, and low student-to-teacher ratios not guns.		Coming soon: how will these steel and aluminium tariffs hurt Alabama. That's for another day.
My final position for today is: tax free food! And make these big box companies and future companies coming to Alabama earn their tax breaks!		Learn more of some of the issues on my website		https://t.co/Uy6WmOTvfv
Programs, more counselors in schools, more parenting classes and stop the school to prison pipeline.
Repeal Direct File. Stop trying kids as adults. Then putting them in adult prisons where they have a high percentage of being abuse. A high rate of depression and suicides. When they come out of prisons their lives are ruined. Lets begin with restoratative justice
And prisons.  Lets re- classify marijuana of 1 ounce and less as fines and NOT felonies. Someone who smokes marijuana should not be classified as a felon. Save tax payers. Add to the budget fees from fines
Ok. Now you got me on my soap box!! Lol. Let's discuss the classification of marijuana! Last year approximately 5000 people were arrested marijuana. Charges and millions spent by LE to enforce those laws. This is rediculous especially since we are dealing with overcrowded jails
And reopen our mental health facilities. Put back into the budget funds for mental health.
Are children and the elderly. Don't cut services expand the services and include those who need it. Then offer healthcare to all of our people and add services for addiction treatment. While we are at it reopen our health facilities especially in the rural and native Amer. comm.
While we are addressing this issue. We must address healthcare and expansion of Medicaid. These 3 issues go hand in hand. Those with addictions should be covered insurance wise. In order for that to happen we have got to stop cutting Medicaid. In Alabama most Medicaid recipients
Most physicians don't do that. That's why I say come up with a integrated collaborative creative plan. That means bringing to the table leaders, patients and doctors. Just know that your pharmaceutical companies don't care about you, just your $$$$
They must be monitored. But there are also a few doctors who don't care and use this as a money maker. We had this happen years ago in a town in originally from. In the basement of his practice was a lab. He made hundreds of thousands of dollars. He was raised. Still in prison.
Come up with a plan that addresses the difference.That's true. That's why leaders need to be creative in addressing the opioid crisis. There are those like you who need it. We need to know the difference and apply it based on that difference. There are those who really need help
There are patients that are in need of meds for pain management. I have been there wh we n I was in a bad accident. I have a problem with including those patients with others that have abused the use of prescription drugs.Doctors know the difference and so does law makers.
So here are a repeat on the opioid crisis and a couple more.	The opioid crisis has always been a crisis. It is only now that it has reached epidemic form in certain specific financial and cultural arenas that it is being addressed. Yes there is a problem. But there is no 1 fix.
And the opioid crisis. Problem is you can only say so much in these threads. I guess the fact is I'm still fully learning how to get around Twitter is a problem also. Anywho, every now and then someone comments on no one will donate or vote with out knowing my issues.
I have addressed many issues on Twitter. I've spoken about gun violence, my position on arming teachers, support of our Millenials, educational lottery, our vets and seniors, healthcare, climate, the importance of voting, repeal of Direct file, restorative youth justice,

Just keep me in prayer and good thoughts. Yes donate. Keep encouraging. BUT WHATEVER you do please don't be rude and negative. We are trying to sincerely represent you and others. I just blocked someone. I have no problems with constructive criticism .But I won't be disrespected.
So thank you. I and other real candidates seeking change are doing this for all of us. You are appreciated. 		Your humble servant		Deborah
So I ask that you be patient with me. Yes I love the encouragement. Keep it coming because standing up and making the decision to run is an awesome task. But we must! Or we won't move forward and we lose.
Because donations are slow. We ask because we know to flip our country, State and districts blue WE MUST do it ourselves. We don't want PAC monies. We don't want to be bought. But fact is the Democratic party is broke. So it's up to us.
I'm so appreciative for the support my Twitter followers have shown. Your encouragement is awesome. I know you may get tired of the donation requests I've made. I'm not just asking you. ALL candidates are in need. I'm putting it out there across the board.
