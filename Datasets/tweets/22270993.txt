Absolutely! If you don’t use the money for it’s intended purpose...you owe it back.

@hms0813 @mitchellvii Brown was moving money around from repairing our dams, roads &amp; other infrastructure to support all the illegals we have pouring (invited) to our state. We have 25% of the nation’s homeless here in Cali who AREN’T being helped...no funds were diverted to assist them.
The contract wouldn’t be between BROWN &amp; the contractor...but STATE of Cali (signed by Brown et al) &amp; contractor. Newsom represents the State. https://t.co/R64HDjdy40
Yes. Most contractors demand up to 50% of the total contract before beginning work.
