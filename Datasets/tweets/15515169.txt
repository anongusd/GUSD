If the illegals knew what New York and Virginia Democrats wanted to do with their unborn and newborn babies -- they would not want to come to America. #StarnesCountry
Virginia Gov. @RalphNortham is a baby-hating monster. And what does it say about the voters who put this savage into office? #StarnesCountry #FoxNation
@whodat_jedi Well, sir. That's a lie.
Who do Democrats detest more? #StarnesCountry #FoxNation
To my fellow Southern Baptists - there is no such thing as white privilege. So pay no attention to those criticizing you because of the color of your skin.
Based on the actions of Democrats in New York and Virginia, the lives of the unborn and newly born are in grave danger. https://t.co/Ut83HtpAos

. @realDonaldTrump on 12/18: "I can’t tell you when the government’s going to be open. I can tell you it’s not going to be open until we have a wall or fence, whatever they’d like to call it." 		Those are your words, Mr. President.
Trump said he would not reopen the government without funding for a border wall. He did not get that funding - so why is he reopening the government?
In 3 weeks, we still won't have the wall, so he will shut down the government, the air traffic controllers will walk off the job and @realDonaldTrump will capitulate again.
So basically -- there's not going to be a wall, folks. And that's that.

Let's be clear - the Deep State is going to punish anyone who helped Trump get elected.
Watch how quickly the Mainstream Media drops their coverage of the Mollie Tibbetts case.
A significant point -- the Cohen and Manafort cases have absolutely nothing to do with Russia collusion.
The man accused of killing Iowa college student Mollie Tibbetts is an illegal alien. But Democrats will tell you that ICE agents are the bad guys.
And still no evidence of collusion... #manafort

President Trump made a mistake. He confessed to the American people he made a mistake. But the Mainstream Media and the Democrats and Establishment Republicans still want to destroy this man.
The Mainstream Media won't be satisfied until Trump is removed from office - by force if necessary -  and publicly flogged.

The Democrats shed tears over the plight of the children of the illegals. Do they shed tears for Justin Lee - a 14-year-old American who was run over by an illegal alien and left to die in a ditch?
So it turns out @SenTedCruz is basically a run-of-the-mill Republican. #sad
For the record -- DACA recipients and other illegals are not welcome on my @foxnews show or in my @foxnewsradio studio. #illegals

Hey @jaketapper and @CNN https://t.co/PRoP2YwK3e Care to comment?
There are an alarming number of people in America who hate the First and Second Amendments.
Agreed. https://t.co/d5pY0aDvMK

The Broward sheriff's true nature comes out tonight, folks. Thank you, @DLoesch for asking the questions that NEEDED to be asked.
Hey @DLoesch and @marcorubio -- this crowd doesn't want you to answer their questions - they want to publicly humiliate you.
Why aren't these kids verbally flogging the sheriff or school superintendent or the FBI?
By town hall meeting -- @CNN meant "Anti-Gun Flogging"
This crowd is hostile. Do the kids speak to their parents and teachers with the same level of disrespect?
What happens when the jury renders its verdict in this @CNN show trial?
It's a public flogging, not a town hall meeting. Hope the ratings are worth it, @jaketapper and @CNN

The MSM is using school children as human shields to attack Trump and law-abiding gun owners. https://t.co/5AecKXG1o4
It turns out one of the loudest anti-Trump activist voices in South Florida is actually a student journalist at the high school.
CNN's strategy is to use teenage journalists to attack the second amendment and the president -- providing cover for their grownup journalists attack anyone who objects to the kids. #propaganda
From the CDC: the leading cause of death among teenagers - car accidents. #FactsMatter
USA Today seems to think that only Trump-hating Olympians are permitted to voice their opinion. It’s a good thing I don’t subscribe to USA Today.
Get ready, folks. Democrats and the MSM are going to use school children to wage a national gun grab and attack Trump. Shameful and despicable - but not surprising.
What is the point of the Olympics — to win medals or to make political statements?
The MSM is using children as propaganda pawns to advance their anti-second amendment agenda. #shameful
A student educated in an American public school classroom said this on national television today: “President Trump, you control the House of Representatives, you control the Senate, and you control the executive."
They don't blame the gunman. They don't blame the sheriff's department. They don't blame the mental health department. They don't blame the school district. They don't blame the FBI. But they blame @realDonaldTrump

Hillary emerged from the woods of Chappaqua to read a #fakebook https://t.co/Qyyw6Sp7zN
@newsbabe1530 Courage.
I recommend Hillary read a few chapters from this book: https://t.co/lpQbBvzFgF #GrammyAwards2018
It would've been really entertaining had Mrs. Bill Clinton read passages from a book detailing how her husband soiled the dignity of the Oval Office not to mention an intern's blue dress. #GrammyAwards2018
Hillary (Mrs. Bill Clinton) reads passages from #FireAndFury during #GrammyAwards. Did they have her on a seven-second delay? #pottymouth
Remember when musicians read passages about Obama's drug use on live television during #GrammyAwards? #FireAndFury
U2 - the official soundtrack of illegal aliens as they invade our great nation. #GrammyAwards2018
So how does this "everyone has their own truth" concept work? What if there are conflicting truths? Whose truth takes precedence? #GrammyAwards2018
Mr. President - no need to be bothered by the opinion of an ex-drug dealer who shot his brother and stabbed a music producer.
So Hillary drops the b-word. Who does she think she is — a rapper? #ToddStarnesShow
First time in history - my connecting flight in Atlanta is in the same terminal and just two gates away. #blessed
