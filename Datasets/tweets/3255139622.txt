@EdAsante77 I wonder what possibly could have happened late 2008 that made Amerika spend so much money
@BuckSexton What's your opinion of Fox "News'?
@aharonml123 @DLoesch Right Wing Amerika wants to be just like Taliban countries where religious group dictates all aspects of society! Constitution expressly states separation of Church and State but these neo so-called conservatives like Dana seem to have forgotten that!
@aharonml123 @DLoesch It matters when she implies that government shouldn't pay for maternal/paternal leave like all other non-3rdworld sh**hole countries because religious organization like Taliban should be responsible for raising your children
@aharonml123 @DLoesch then she could have used a non-religious term like community, family, neighbors
@aharonml123 @DLoesch How else do you interpret "don’t petition the government to do what your church SHOULD do instead" if you don't assume that everyone has a Church that should help you out?

@SilverPrick @greenhousenyt (also they or their children never got sick and had to go to hospital)!!
@SilverPrick @greenhousenyt I'm just thinking that 300% increase in wealth isn't much! My middle class parents increased their wealth by over 10000% during that same time period simply because they didn't re-fi their home to  buy cheap Chinese made products!!
@JackKingston @realDonaldTrump Over the year, average hourly earnings have increased by 85 cents, or 3.2 percent. Average hourly earnings of private-sector production and nonsupervisory employees increased by 3 cents to $23.12 in January.
@JackKingston @realDonaldTrump You should thank Demokrats who raised state minimum and local minimum wages for increase!!

@chunter4444 @RepMaxineWaters just saying it was a lot easier in the past. Now (where I live) it's next to impossible to get a lease unless you're a big chain or have multi-millionaire investors backing you. All the stores used to be family owned. Now they're all national chains.

@chunter4444 @RepMaxineWaters That's just the top Google result. Other links after that have net worth ranging from $1-3 million. Still low if she bought and held onto any kind of real estate in CA.

@benandreas369 @StewartRudy @BryanDeanWright Trump won by only a few thousand votes in 3 key states!! Coincidently the same states that had voters removed from voting rolls!!! lots of schinagagans going on in the upper midwest!!!
@benandreas369 @BryanDeanWright I'm asking why did they lie about it??		https://t.co/FuFApeDCIi
@BryanDeanWright Instead they said who? me meet with a Russian? I don't even know any Russians
@BryanDeanWright Yeah? So why did every member of the campaign lie about meeting with Russians if everything was kosher?? They could have just said yes. We seek Russian alliance to help Amerika fight enemies!!!

@mr_mojo112978 @HouseGOP @TheIJR @CBSPolitics Most of that was the 1st year to bail out the too-big-to-fail banks. If he didn't save the billionaires, the entire financial system was at risk of collapse! After that the deficit decreased each year. Then Trump came along and it's skyrocketing again in a good economy!!!

@mr_mojo112978 @HouseGOP @TheIJR It's horrible Trump is continuing that policy even though he wants to erase everything his predesessor has done! worse that the GOP is increasing military spending to continue this practice of murder instead of trying to fix the health care problem!!
@kenbensinger I can't believe she's only 29!! That's a lot of vodka drinking!!!

@mr_mojo112978 @HouseGOP @TheIJR every dollar they give to the military goes to murdering people in foreign countries.	It took them forever to fund CHIP. They care more about bombs than babies!
@mr_mojo112978 @HouseGOP @TheIJR Then Congress should have repealed it like they promised instead of letting it die a slow and painful death. But they seem to like people to suffer! Much better to fund the military instead of CHIP. The pro-life party prefers death to saving people's lives!!
@mr_mojo112978 @HouseGOP @TheIJR He calls every network except Fox News as well as every major newspaper.
@mr_mojo112978 @HouseGOP @TheIJR "Repeal Obamacare" was Trump and  every GOP congressman's campaign promise! Trump has already taken steps to destabilize the market in hopes it crashes and Congress is doing nothing to fix anything.
@mr_mojo112978 @HouseGOP @TheIJR The GOP is trying to take away health insurance from millions of people so the next time they end up needing a doctor, they visit the emergency room. If they can't pay their bills, they file for bankruptcy, losing what little savings they have. I can't believe you don't know that

@BobSpear7 @joelpollak You should read old LA Times articles. Pllenty of critics complained of the Obama administration deporting fathers, breaking up families. As awful as Obama's policies were, he didn't intentionally take a child away from her parent and place her in a concentration camp!!!
@realDonaldTrump LIAR IN CHIEF		YOU CAN'T BE TRUSTED		LIAR LIAR LIAR PANTS ON FIRE
@joelpollak What's crazy, offensive and stupid is taking away small children from their parents as a sick deterrent to try to make Amerika White Again!!!
@TheLamarckian @tnacgal @realJDRico @cdnrod @secupp From your link:		The number of Family Units increased by 435 percent
@TheLamarckian @tnacgal @realJDRico @cdnrod @secupp Give back the children who are being stolen from their parents right now at this very moment because of a change of Amerikan policy!
@cdnrod Good question! People that resourceful should be allowed to stay because they've already proven themselves not to be lazy!!
@realJDRico @tnacgal @cdnrod @secupp Trump policy from late 2017	El Paso judge denies motion of immigrant parents separated from children https://t.co/XqzBmNa4V0 via @houstonchron
@realJDRico @tnacgal @cdnrod @secupp She didn't say sent back without their parents! 	2014 was the surge of unaccompanied minors.
@cdnrod @debra45283816 @realJDRico @tnacgal @secupp @Kaepernick7 Where was the conservative media's outrage when this was happening in 2014? What were they focused on? I bet every one of Fox commentators were talking about black people and Obama's race baiting!!!
@debra45283816 @realJDRico @tnacgal @cdnrod @secupp sorry wrong yesr. 2015		judge blasts ICE, says immigrant children, parents in detention centers should be released https://t.co/2JuFRXGo0u
@debra45283816 @realJDRico @tnacgal @cdnrod @secupp Nope. A judge ended that in 2014. You probably weren't paying attention because Fox was fixated on Ferguson and football players protesting police brutality
@cdnrod I hope you won't be disappointed if he spends his retirement on the beaches of Hawaii!
@realJDRico @tnacgal @cdnrod @secupp Smearing got Trump elected with his constant lies!! I suppose you believe Obama is really Kenyan!!!
@realJDRico @tnacgal @cdnrod @secupp So why is Trump taking children away from their parents? Is he selling them and forcing them to work as slaves? I know Sessions supports slavery!
@cdnrod No. Do you?
@realJDRico @tnacgal @cdnrod @secupp Nope!! The ACLU has sued Trump administration because their policies violate international law		ACLU challenges Trump administration practice of separating migrant parents and children https://t.co/7u7ivh32yA via @HoustonChronHS
@cdnrod But it's not in the best interest to traumatize small children!!
@realJDRico @tnacgal @cdnrod @secupp If Trump knows this is going on why is he allowing it to continue!! Why is he taking children away from parents?? He has no problem ending everything else Obama did!!!
@tnacgal @realJDRico @cdnrod @secupp I didn't use that word. You did because you know it's horrible to take away a small child from her mother!
@realJDRico @secupp So why are tents specifically being constructed to house children separate from their parents? Whose policy is it? Are agents acting on their own??
@tnacgal @realJDRico @cdnrod @secupp You think it's acceptable to separate small children from their mothers???
@JackPosobiec you think it's weird to be outraged over toddlers being dragged away from their mothers??? You must be channelling your Polish roots!!!!
