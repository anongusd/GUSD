@BenCKinney Being on Facebook sometimes makes me feel like I am back in grade school. Maybe I should figure out this Twitter thing and join famous Tweeters like @jk_rowling, infamous ones like @realDonaldTrump, cereal/serial Tweeters like @MikeH5856  and you LOL. =P
@BenCKinney 2nd Steve blocked me in solidarity with the 1st Steve. A Charlie blocked me in solidarity with Steven. The strange pattern is that they are all Jewish. If I see @StephenKing or Stephen Spielberg IRL I will run away because apparently I have a proven bad track record with Steves.
@BenCKinney 1 Steven blocked me bc I didn't ask his permission b4 I added him 2 the @MosheMF Can Club; another Steve blocked me b4 I could get to my punchline on PM; thru a loophole I managed 2 get on his wall to send him the rest of the msg; he said he would make it right; it has been days.
@BenCKinney You don't say...T_T
@BenCKinney I actually came here to show you this: https://t.co/UCoQIu7OGD		My ability to go off weird tangents is legendary. My poor Facebook friends are resigned to it by now. =P
@BenCKinney I don't think I can take yet another social media platform right now...I am mostly on Facebook right now. Maybe Instagram and/or Twitter. Tumblr if pressed. Anything more than that and I will just get crazier than I already am. =P
@BenCKinney Apologize if it made u uncomfortable. I am just terrible at teasing people. Sorry? No discomfort intent meant? @MikeH5856 actually blocked me on Facebook before I got to my Love Actually punchline on Private Message on Facebook. That's how stupid I can sometimes be. I'm only &lt;30.
