The last #TrumpShutdown cost our economy billions and federal workers are still recovering, which is why I support this deal and urge the President to sign it immediately. Our country cannot endure another reckless shutdown.
This deal will give a 1.9 percent pay raise to federal civilian workers, provide $3 billion for state and local law enforcement, address the opioid crisis, and rebuild America‚Äôs infrastructure, which will bring in nearly $100 million in additional highway funding for Illinois.
The government funding deal, which includes seven appropriations bills rejected President Trump‚Äôs deep budget cuts and instead make bold investments in top priorities, which will have a positive effect on my constituents in Illinois‚Äô 1st Congressional District.
It denies President Trump the billions of dollars he demanded for a wasteful and ineffective border wall, places a check on his out-of-control deportation policy, funds a more humane immigration system, and provides resources for smart, effective border security.
While this is not the agreement I would have written, it does, reflect the true spirit of compromise and the best possible deal to responsibly fund our government and secure our border. This deal to keep government open secured major victories on our key Democratic priorities.
Today, I voted to prevent another senseless #TrumpShutdown. I am pleased that we were able to work in a bipartisan way to fund the remainder of the federal government for the rest of the fiscal year.
And I will cosponsor it. This #FakeEmergency is a disgrace. https://t.co/YXwZX0hUhw

This is a sad day for our nation because the Supreme Court will forever be tainted by Judge Kavanaugh who is not worthy of the honor, privilege, and opportunity of this lifetime appointment.
His confirmation is a step backwards for minorities across our country as he will radically reverse course on America‚Äôs long march towards justice and will actively seek to dismantle fundamental rights. #Kavanaugh
Judge Kavanaugh has also proven to have a dangerous and expansive view of presidential authority and has repeatedly sided with special corporate interests over that of ordinary Americans.
His invocation of the Clintons and the 2016 Presidential election, his contempt towards members of the Committee, and the belligerence he displayed disqualified him from not only the Supreme Court, but from any position in the judiciary. #Kavanaugh
I fear that his performance in his supplemental testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee is an indicator of the partisanship and divisiveness that he espouses and, clearly, seeks to inject in to the Supreme Court. #Kavanaugh
Judge Kavanaugh will no doubt be an activist judge who threatens to hinder the Constitutionally-protected rights that all Americans hold dear for decades to come.
It is a disgrace that a political operative with such visible partisan leanings and contempt and disrespect for Congress‚Äô role as a coequal branch of our federal government could be elevated to our nation‚Äôs most-respected institution. #Kavanaugh
Now ‚Äî with the help of Senators who outright ignored Judge Kavanaugh‚Äôs flawed views, hostility toward our current health care system, and lack of judicial temperament ‚Äî he will, unfortunately, have a seat on the highest court in the land.

Today, it is important that we finish the work of these trailblazing women and Congressman Dyer and rewrite the wrongs of history.
During this period, women were important and prominent figures. Before this legislation was introduced they already had a grassroots movement in motion. They were organizing petition drives, fundraising, and educating communities.
Congressman Dyer, who was the first to introduce an anti-lynching bill in 1918, motivated them and helped galvanize a movement. His bill was intended to punish authorities that failed to prevent lynching and act as a deterrent to end the practice. Unfortunately, it did not pass.
The horrific, despicable, and racist practice of lynching spawned their activism. African-American women stood at the forefront in public protest of these racially motivated, inhumane, and evil crimes.
It is also important to remember the role African-American women played in the anti-lynching movement. It was black women who created the group, Anti-Lynching Crusaders, with the backing of the NAACP.
The National Memorial for Peace and Justice, which is the nation's first memorial dedicated to the legacy of enslaved black people, people terrorized by lynching must not be the last.
My bill will also provide grants to encourage and preserve the history of the anti-lynching movement.
Today, I announced my intention to introduce a bill to make Lynching a federal crime. This bill is in part symbolic but relevant. You only need to look at the events in Charlottesville to be reminded that not too long ago rallies such as those resulted in Lynchings. https://t.co/AF2KwAxVaE

I look forward to working with my Congressional colleagues on these commonsense digital security solutions that will improve the trust of the American people who rely on these platforms.
This industry‚Äôs lack of regulation has made everyone vulnerable to their data being placed in the wrong hands.  We cannot let this industry continue to police themselves.
As news of yet another data breach comes to light, Americans are being shaken to their core and their trust in these companies is eroding. It is no longer enough for citizens to hope companies improve their internal actions. It must be mandated, as the DATA Act requires.
The DATA Act would require the Federal Trade Commission issue regulations requiring companies that own or possess data containing personal information to establish specified and hardened security policies and procedures that would treat and protect our information.
The time for strong, national data privacy and data protection rules is now and we must put them in place before it is too late. It is clear that our personal information is on the line and up for sale to the highest bidder, the most nefarious bad actor.
Americans have seen their private information compromised by two more companies, Orbitz and now Under Armour. Our personal information, whether it be travel or fitness related is being compromised at a truly unnerving rate.
