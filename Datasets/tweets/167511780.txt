Trump: "Before we discuss too much DACA, I would like to see what happens...		"I don't think it's going to hold up at the Supreme Court. If it doesn't hold up you're going to see a lot of good things happening. ... Hopefully by that time the wall will be well under construction."

Trump: "I'm very proud of doing what I'm doing. I don't call it a shutdown. I call doing what you have to do for the safety of the country."
"We set out a number $5.6 billion. We're very firm on a number," Trump said. "We have to get a structure built."
"We won't be doing pieces. We won't be doing drips or drabs," Trump said of a plan to reopen government.

Things are looking pretty good for Pelosi's speaker bid right now. So far only 8 of the newly elected Democrats have said they won't support her, only 3 of whom have been clear that applies to the floor vote		https://t.co/FVlaJplHHi
Tim Ryan has previously said he'd only challenge Pelosi if he thinks he could win, so that's likely why he's not planning to at this point https://t.co/8ZwOP2EYg9
"When Demcorats win -- and we will tonight -- we will have a congress that is open, transparent and accountable to the American people,” Pelosi said. “We will strive for bipartisan, seeking common ground … but when we can’t find that common ground, we will stand our ground.”
“We don’t agonize. We organize," Pelosi said. "Many of you across the country are volunteers in politics, our VIPS. Women and men mobilized in historic numbers. ... Thanks to you, we have owned the ground.”
House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi thanked Democratic volunteers for their efforts, saying every text they sent, call they made and door they knocked made a difference. She urged them to continue to get out the vote until the final polls close.
DCCC Chairman Ben Ray Luján touted Wexton's and Shalala's wins at what Democrats hope will be a victory party at the Hyatt Regency in Washington.		“We’re off to a good start everybody,” he said.		"I’m confident that Democrats will win the majority."

@alixabeth @pklinkne @rollcall I don't understand the anti-tax frame re welfare programs. As for anti-government assistance, that's not totally accurate either because Ryan isn't talking about cutting overall federal $ spent upfront. It's a nuanced issue so hard to label. Sorry you disagree w/ anti-poverty
@alixabeth @pklinkne @rollcall There are differing views on whether Ryan's policies would help reduce poverty, but it's not my job to pick btween them. I don't believe describing his efforts as anti-poverty takes a position but rather just reports his stated goal. I understand not all agree w/ that description
@alixabeth @pklinkne @rollcall The framing you are suggesting is ideological because it ascribes a motive to his policies that he does not ascribe. Ryan and conservatives say their goal is to fight poverty, so the description of an anti-poverty push is accurate portrayal of what they say they're trying to do.
@pklinkne @alixabeth @rollcall While neither of you have explained your opposition to the article it sounds like your issue is you don't agree with Ryan's policies.		My job is not to pass judgement on policies either party is pushing; it's to report what they're doing and the outlook for its success.
@pklinkne Care to say why you think that? Just calling it a disgrace without explanation is not constructive for anyone reading your tweet
Ryan has spent his 20-year congressional career primarily focused on two issues, taxes &amp; poverty. The speaker led a major rewrite of the tax code last year, but when he retires at the end of this term he won’t have many accomplishments to tout on poverty.		https://t.co/QpqwThUm7N

@HouseInSession I was thinking about legislative maneuvers but even that backfired so ...
@HouseInSession I have a hard time seeing Ryan doing anything lame duck like until the lame duck session after leadership elections
@HouseInSession I'm confused. What part of that offer is supposed to appeal to Ryan?
Now @GOPLeader, @RepMarkMeadows  and @Jim_Jordan have moved their meeting from McCarthy's office to @SpeakerRyan's office
Freedom Caucus leaders @RepMarkMeadows and @Jim_Jordan just walked into @GOPLeader's office
Wonder if Trump knows the Freedom Caucus is trying to delay the farm bill vote until after immigration legislation hits the floor https://t.co/zWXBSeZZ5V
@MEPFuller Frelinghuysen has never voted for the farm bill and not planning to now, so I'd be surprised if Ryan were really trying to move him on that
June would be the time to vote on immigration legislation, @GOPLeader said, dismissing the Freedom Caucus's request to move that issue ahead of the farm bill.		"It's hard when you're debating the farm bill right now to change things up," he said.
Freedom Caucus members want GOP leaders to schedule a floor vote on immigration legislation before completing work on the farm bill the House is currently debating &amp; scheduled to vote on tomorrow. 		Leadership not changing the floor schedule at this time 		https://t.co/2M9Yh55NS5
A leadership aide said there is no planned changed to the floor scheduled right now and that discussions about a path forward continue.
A twist emerges!		Meadows after a meeting of the Freedom Caucus said the "vast majority" of their members would like to see immigration dealt with before the farm bill.		"I believe there's more than enough to hold it up," he said.

McHenry predicted "a good resolution by the end of the week" but said it's to be determined whether that will include a vote on an immigration bill. 		"I think we'll have the votes for the farm bill," he said.
Scalise says immigration and the farm bill are "not directly tied to together," but says leadership is working with conservatives and moderates on both.		"There's an interest in resolving both of those bills. So we're working with them to see if we can resolve each of them."

Trump also calls on Congress to give him a line item veto for all government spending bills. 		Also not going to happen. 		But will Congress call him on this Article 1 violation? Probably not
Trump again calls for getting rid of the Senate filibuster rule and going to a simple majority vote on legislation.		Not going to happen.
"As a matter of national security I've signed this omnibus budget bill," Trump says. 		Then he adds, "There are a lot of things that I'm unhappy about in this bill. There are a lot of things we shouldn't have had. But we were in a sense forced if we want to rebuild our military"
@billblevins Sounds like it
"As crazy as it's been, as difficult as it's been ... " Trump starts a thought then goes off on a tangent
"You can tell me who can read that quickly," Trump says of 2200 plus page omnibus. 		No one
Trump finally comes out and says WH officials are going to talk a bit about trade. 		"Then we're going to get onto this ridiculous situation that took place over the last week."

Nonetheless, this all could suggest a plan for a Thursday House vote on the omnibus is underway. 		If true, members will likely have less than 24 hours to review the massive $1.3 trillion spending bill before voting. Likely biggest legislative package to be voted on this year.
Timing of House vote series went from being expected around 1:45-2:30 p.m. to approximately 4:00-4:15 p.m. to now " very fluid."		Possible they're waiting for omnibus to be filed so they can whip it. 		Whip likely to produce a lot of undecideds with no time to read the bill

In February more than half of the Democratic Caucus, including Pelosi and Hoyer, voted against the budget deal/CR because of inaction on DACA.		"Certainly we're in a similar situation, yes," Hoyer said, declining to comment further until he sees the omnibus.
Hoyer said he and many other Democratic Caucus members are deeply frustrated about the inaction on DACA and Republicans' refusal to allow the House to work its will. 		"We believe this is a very, very critical issue to be resolved. None of us want to shutdown government."
House Democrats may trouble voting for the omnibus if there's no commitment on DACA.		Hoyer said the caucus hasn't determined what it will do and won't until it sees the omnibus but noted DACA is "very much high up on my mind as we consider this issue."

House Minority Whip Steny Hoyer introducing a 4-day continuing resolution to end the government shutdown while putting pressure on Republicans' to reach an agreement with Democrats on a broader spending package by Tuesday.
Ryan apparently is not calling for Meehan's resignation at this time. 		"Any further action or comment will come pending a full and prompt investigation by the Ethics Committee," Strong said.
"The new reforms going into place bar the use of taxpayer money to pay settlements, and so the speaker has also told Mr. Meehan that he should repay whatever taxpayer funds were used to settle this case," she said.
With the House set to pass a bipartisan bill to overhaul the process by which the House handles claims of sexual harassment, "the speaker will apply these new standards to the allegations made against Mr. Meehan," Strong said.
Ryan spoke with Meehan Saturday and the Pennsylvania Republican agreed to submit himself to the Ethics Committee for review.
“Speaker Ryan takes the allegations against Mr. Meehan very seriously," Ryan spokeswoman AshLee Strong said. "Though Mr. Meehan has denied the allegations, they must be fully and immediately investigated by the House Ethics Committee."

Democrats would agree to a short-term CR if there's an agreement on "parity" in raising the budget caps with payfors and a deal on DACA and border security, among other items, Pelosi said.
House Minority Leader @NancyPelosi rejected McConnell's plan for a Feb. 8 CR and open floor debate on an immigration bill.		"There's no point having a CR unless we have the terms of engagement on how we go forward," the California Democrat said.
.@RepPeterDeFazio said @SpeakerRyan erred in negotiating with the @freedomcaucus to get to 218 votes on the CR, saying striking a deal with the most extreme faction of Congress "is always a dead end."		He urged Ryan to negotiate with Democrats going forward.
And yes unfortunately this is a presser where half a dozen or more members will speak and basically say the same thing.
"Good morning and welcome to the Trump shutdown," House Democratic Caucus Chairman Joe Crowley opened a press conference Saturday. 		He said Republican lawmakers are "enabling and being complicit" in the president's shutdown.
House GOP unified w/ White House on not negotiating on immigration until government is open. 		While GOP leaders said they'd accept a stopgap through Feb. 8, most rank-and-file members declined to take a position beyond the 4-week CR the House passed, saying the Senate should act
"I believe we would accept if they went through Feb. 8," @GOPLeader said of Senate plan to send the House a shorter CR.
Dent says path forward will involve House GOP leaders agreeing to bring up a bipartisan DACA bill, even if it doesn't have support of a majority of Republicans. 		Conservatives might revolt "but that's the price of leadership."
"We're going to get blamed whether we deserve it or not, that's just the way it is,"   @RepCharlieDent said of GOP blame for shutdown. Says in reality both sides at fault.

Can anyone explain why McConnell is proposing to end the "3-week" CR on Feb. 8, a Thursday, instead of Feb. 9, a Friday?
.@SpeakerRyan: “Senate Democrats have let down our troops, our children, and all Americans. They will do anything to appease their base, even shut down the federal government."
House GOP whip update: 		"Members are advised that we no longer expect votes in the House tonight. We now expect the House to reconvene later today (Sat., Jan. 20) at 9 a.m.	 	Members are further advised that we expect the House to be in session and voting on Sat., Jan. 20."
And actually House Democrats retreat is Feb. 7-9, my bad. Figured McConnell was pushing a true 3-week CR. But he's only going for 2 weeks, 6 days w/ Feb. 8, a Thursday
*retreat, which in some cases is also a treat :)
McConnell says he'll offer an amendment to change CR date to Feb. 8 -- Graham's 3-week CR proposal. 		House Democrats are supposed to be in Cambridge on their treat Feb. 6-8
McConnell notes that the Trump administration isn't going to negotiate on immigration while the government is shutdown		"So this particular strategy has eliminated the possibility of getting a signature on the thing they shut the government down over."
"I want to commend the five Democrats who had the courage to stand up to this ridiculous strategy," @SenateMajLdr says

"The Senate bluff is not real," McHenry said, also predicting the CR will pass in the upper chamber.
McHenry did suggest the vote will be close because he said they need to wait on the PA delegation that is traveling with Trump to return to the Captiol.		Still, McHenry said he was even more confident headed into Thursday's vote than he was on the past two CR votes in December.
House Chief Deputy Whip Patrick McHenry said confidently Thursday afternoon that the CR will pass the House later that evening with Republican votes and without any changes.

Graham, Durbin, Jeff Flake, Bennet, Gardner &amp; Menendez say they have "an agreement in principle that addresses border security, the diversity visa lottery, chain migration/family reunification, and the Dream Act." 		"We are now working to build support for that deal in Congress."
DACA-related highlights from @SpeakerRyan's presser today: 		He expects a bipartisan DACA deal. 		He's open to voting on Goodlatte bill that Pelosi said is a nonstarter. 		He predicts a DACA deal will be something a majority of Republicans can support. 		https://t.co/5F6Qd5hZLu
Now Ryan talking about military needs. He quotes Chairman Thornberry: "We have too few planes that can fly, too few ships that can sail and too few soldiers that can deploy."
.@SpeakerRyan opens his weekly press conference talking about the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act that passed last year and resulting company bonuses etc.  "This is just getting started and we look forward to more good news."
2 scenarios:		Impasse on spending/DACA. Republicans put up most of the votes for a CR in both chambers, w/ help of a few vulnerable Senate Democrats.		Deal on caps/DACA. Democrats supply a bulk of the votes for the CR amid objections from conservatives.		https://t.co/sgns0Px3xv

The California Democrat did not respond to a question about whether Republicans offered them parity on the budget caps. 		On whether Democrats pushes for a DACA fix, Pelosi said, "Always."
"Hope so," House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi told reporters when asked after the budget cap meeting if leaders were closer to a deal. 		When asked if another short-term continuing resolution would be needed, she Pelosi said the opposite: "I certainly hope not."
@jtraub2 Expect forthcoming news declaring you the winner ;)

@RichardRubinDC @SethHanlon @SenateFinance And to be fair when I say as originally intended I mean years ago when W&amp;M and Finance seriously started working on all this. Even as of PATH Act in 2015 goal was for tax reform to be the final word on extenders

Tax reform, as the GOP originally intended, was supposed to get rid of tax extenders but it actually created more. And the bill didn't address some expiring provisions so @SenateFinance has put out a tax extenders bill:	https://t.co/pO7DDdLr1P
Those "values and priorities" Pelosi mentions: "parity in the CAPS, .. funding for opioids, veterans, pensions, NIH, and support for the DREAM Act."		Those aren't happening by Friday so don't expect House Dems to help Republicans pass a CR. Question is what Senate Dems will do
Pelosi pens dear colleague letter urging the Democratic Caucus to vote against an expected stopgap funding bill.		"Unless we see a respect for our values and priorities, we continue to urge a strong NO on the Continuing Resolution," Pelosi said.
Trump fundraising email touts things the tax bill will do. Number one on the list: "Cuts taxes by $1.5 TRILLION."		Cut taxes. Increase the deficit. Same thing, right?

“We know they’re going to send something back, whatever that is,” Rep. Charlie Dent said of the Senate. “Leadership just wants some flexibility to deal with these tactical matters.”
The consensus play still seems to be to do the defense/CR combo, despite a warning shot from Senate Democrats that they have enough votes to block such a measure in their chamber.		https://t.co/ukDTgWF3eH
Brat, talking to reporters outside the chamber about the spending plan, sees Paul Ryan approach and notes that the Speaker Ryan has an open process and "is a very fair guy." 		Then Brat follows Ryan into the chamber and tells him that was on the record.

Trump talking about tax reform conference suggests corporate rate could still go up, per press pool. 		“Business tax all the way down from 35 to 20. It could be 22 when it comes out but it could also be 20. We’ll see what ultimately comes out.”
House Republicans don't believe CR through Dec. 22 is a done deal. During conference they discussed alternatives that members would fine more acceptable like a CR through Dec. 30 	https://t.co/YIDOGnIVGY

Senate tax bill would still cost $1.007 trillion over 10 years under JCT's dynamic score.
JCT dynamic score of Senate tax overhaul bill estimates GDP would increase by about 0.8 percent per year on average over the 10- year budget window. (Republicans have been hoping for 0.4 percent or more). JCT says that would result in about $458 billion in revenue over 10 years.

@WaysandMeansGOP @RepTomReed If, for example, the income tax deduction was added back in but as an alternative to claiming the property tax deduction, that wouldn't be helpful, Zeldin said. But if an income tax deduction cap were added on top of the property deduction cap it could be, he added.
@WaysandMeansGOP @RepTomReed New York GOP Reps. Lee Zeldin, Peter King and Dan Donovan, who voted against the House tax bill, said GOP leaders have not talked to them about reviving the income tax deduction. 	Whether a change will benefit their constituents will depend how it's structured, Zeldin said.
@WaysandMeansGOP @RepTomReed California Rep. Dana Rohrabacher, who voted against the House tax bill, said leadership has not talked to him about reviving the income tax deduction but he's "anxious" to hear about it, saying, "It would make a lot of difference to me."
@WaysandMeansGOP Tax writer @RepTomReed said leaders are still negotiating, but noted, "As you saw with the cap on the property taxes, similar type of cap conversations are expected in regards to the income tax side of that because that makes a lot of sense."

Yes, that means what you think it means, but we already knew this: No amendments being adopted in Rules Committee for floor debate. Brady didn't come with a manager's amendment, which would've been the only one to get adopted.

Ryan on GOP Health Care Bill: ‘We Will Get Hit For This’ https://t.co/CIuWqTlkEP via @RollCall
@benyc @JamesArkin True. He didn't really know what they were called
YES!!! I really wonder if Ryan has ever texted this gif to somebody https://t.co/J3LKJxszzt
@JamesArkin With the G sound
Ryan says he's got gifs of Stifler, Britney Spears, Caption Obvious. "These things are pretty damn funny." https://t.co/D2pXUWpYG5
Ryan discovered gifs 3 weeks ago, says, "These things are awesome. ... I send gifs to people who really don't expect it from me."
Asked about @realDonaldTrump calling former FBI Director James Comey a nut job, Ryan said, “I don’t agree with that and he’s not.”
"You’ll have to do more base broadening within the domestic economy than not if you don’t do a border adjustment,” Ryan said
Ryan says Republicans agree on 80 percent of policies that should go into a tax code rewrite, still debating other 20 percent, including BAT
Ryan on health care: "I’ll accept that we will get hit for this. But we’re in leadership. We don’t have a choice." #AHCA

Brat asked if he read the health care bill (#AHCA), says, "Yes. I think as you see tonight I know every subsection of the bill.”
.@RepDaveBrat, asked how many terms he'd limit himself to, says, “Good question. I already limited myself to 6 terms, 12 years at the onset”
"Everybody says, ‘Work across the aisle.' I’m working across the aisle and it’s loud right now,” Brat says
Brat, preexisting conditions: "The only chance is 11 million people&amp;only the states that opt out&amp;only the person that changes their coverage
"The people that are yelling are no helping to get to solutions,” Brat says
"I’m trying to win you over to our side," Brat says to crowd which he noted earlier is mostly Democrats (actually mostly Hillary supporters)
Lots of crowd heckling here at @RepDaveBrat's town hall.
.@RepDaveBrat: "You may disagree with me on policy but on facts you’ll see I tell you the truth every time.”
State Sen. Amanda Chase, who is co-hosting this town hall, asked security to come up, crowd boos to that and there's exchange happening
Crowd then erupts into chant of "Read our questions." Brat says he will take questions after he provides an overview of the health care bill
As crowd interrupts his survey, Brat says, "If we go this route it’s going to be very hard to have rational civil discourse.”

Vice President Mike Pence just arrived to his Capitol Hill office
@TopherSpiro We've reached out to house office multiple times and haven't heard back.
@hoglundan Yes, the moving target is why it's hard to capture all in one story. We had some good ones last week but numbers there are now out of date
@hoglundan So for example there are at least five moderates who were a YES on the bill before that are now undecided...those are key if they turn to NO
@hoglundan Honestly there are a lot of folks that would probably fall in the undecided category, the key is where they were before...
@hoglundan When I saw we've independently confirmed, I mean we're not relying on other outlets' reporting, like the whip Hill's list, for example
@hoglundan Other outlets may have confirmed 22, but some people are reporting Mike Coffman as a no but his spox told my colleague he's still reviewing
.@eemershon @sfpathe Forgot to include Katko in that list for those who were counting
3/3 ... Long, Meehan, Massie, Ros Lehtinen, Chris Smith, Webster, David Young. NO votes verified by me, @eemershon &amp; @sfpathe
2/3 Those NO votes are: Amodei, Biggs, Comstock, Costello, Denham, Dent, Donovan, Fitzpatrick, Herrera Beutler, Jones, Lance, Lobiondo ...
