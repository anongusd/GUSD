@bittaxer This is not practical. Pay the cap gain taxes and move on.
Always strive and fight to be in a room that's above your weight class. If you find yourself with people who are better than you, smarter than you, and you're like, 'I have no business being around these people,' then you are also going to elevate and become smarter and better.
