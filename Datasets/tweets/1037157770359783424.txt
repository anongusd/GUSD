@SvenStrasen @fromtamara @hgptof @SkyeFoxMami @SenBobCorker Sorry Sven, but perhaps if something happens to you and you know beyond a shadow of doubt you didn't do it and someone accuses. I think you would react different.
@SvenStrasen @fromtamara @hgptof @SkyeFoxMami @SenBobCorker No it was not a court case or a job interview. It was pure slander. No proof,when,where or ANYONE'S word that it happened.  No family base to backup her claim. No Police report. NOTHING.
@hgptof @fromtamara @SkyeFoxMami @SenBobCorker It's not always a gang date or a date. Those people who have never been through it can't understand anything about it and have no clue. It is almost as bad as being accused of something when innocent and being jailed with only yourself to defend you.
