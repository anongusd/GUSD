Gen Hyten: "The fundamentals of deterrence haven't changed.	1) Have the ability to impose cost on an adversary	2) Have ability to deny benefit to adversary	3) Credibly communicate capability to adversary." #RNDF https://t.co/BktxnMtTlQ

Gen Hyten: "Growing up, I wanted to be the colonel program director, not the general. Because you had the authority &amp; responsibility to deliver SBIRS and DSP and GPS for the world. When the Lts &amp; Capts want to be the colonels again, that's the day you're getting it right." #RNDF
Gen Hyten: "Every missile that comes off the planet is seen first by one of our orbiting capabilities. We have to keep providing that capability to the warfighter. Missile warning is one of the most important missions @US_Stratcom has." #RNDF
Gen Hyten: "We have to keep the requirements under control in order to go fast. And as the combatant commander, I'm going to hold the services to that." #RNDF
Gen Htyten: "I'm a combatant commander. My requirement from the warfighter is an agile, good enough capability, that should be delivered significantly in advance of that 2029 date. We have to be careful not to let the requirements run wild." #RNDF

Gen. Hyten: "We have two Marines in the NSDC. When it comes to warfighting, they know better than everyone else. If they treat every problem as a warfighting problem, they are smarter than anybody else in the NSDC." #RNDF
Gen Hyten: "Words are important. We needed to call JICSpOC what it is. National Space Defense Center. We have to put all the military and intel community in one place to defend space."
This is what Gen. Hyten just mentioned at #RNDF panel. https://t.co/8TpnitCUnZ
Gen Hyten: "By this time next year, @US_Stratcom will have a warfighting construct. We now have the smartest guy on space in charge of our space forces. My number one focus as USSTRATCOM commander is nuclear, it has to be."
Gen. Hyten: "Yesterday was a significant day in the operationalization of space. We stood down JFCC Space and stood up a Joint Force Space Component Commander. @AFSpaceCC is now my space component commander." #RNDF
