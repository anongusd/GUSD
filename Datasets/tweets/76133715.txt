What's in the gov funding deal for Rs?	I'm told there NO internal enforcement ICE cap; 5,000 detention beds above record funding in FY201; flexibility to deal with current detention population AND surges; enough flexibility to reach Trump's requested level of 52,000 beds.

@NitaLowey, chair of apropos, on the shutdown deal: "It is sad that it took 35 days of inflicting pain and misery on Americans for President Trump and Republicans to come to their senses and agree to this solution, but it is better late than never."
Probably the most important words Trump said were about the wall being “whatever “ you want to call it. That is the way out.
So, Trump caved for now. But pay very close attention to the conference committee that will have to put the long term deal together. “Amnesty” has killed progress for years. https://t.co/ZYXqYY1xf2
Q to Sen. Kramer, leaving Republican meeting on deal: Are you on board? “Why not?”
3 week shutdown deal is tentative until it is actually announced, so be wary. But, as of now, it would include a vehicle to go to conference on a Homeland Security bill. This would be where Trump could get much of what he wants, but not a "wall."

Pelosi to Trump: Forget the #SOTU. "I am writing to inform you that the House of Representatives will not consider a concurrent resolution authorizing the President’s State of the Union address in the House Chamber until government has opened"
More Schiff, Cummings on Cohen postponing: "We will not let the President’s tactics prevent Congress from fulfilling our constitutionally mandated oversight responsibilities.  This will not stop us from getting to the truth."
"Our nation’s laws prohibit efforts to discourage, intimidate, or otherwise pressure a witness not to provide testimony to Congress. The President should make no statement or take any action to obstruct Congress’ independent oversight," including discouraging any witness.
Schiff, Cummings re Michael Cohen: "We certainly understand the completely legitimate concerns for the safety and security of Mr. Cohen and his family members in light of the attacks last week by President Trump and again this past weekend by his attorney, Rudy Giuliani."
Somehow, I don't see a concurrent resolution passing the House: @RepJeffries: "Unless the government is reopened, it's highly unlikely the State of the Union is going to take place on the floor of the US House of Representatives." #SOTU https://t.co/syHBNkIAIN

More: "Fighting against this will take all of us- it cannot be a fight left to people of color alone. It is wrong to ask men and women of color to bear the burdens of every single one of these fights over and over and over again. White women like me must share in this burden"
But she also went intersectional: "There are many layers of bias in this country. Women of color face even greater challenges because of the intersectionality of both sexism and racism. This fact is compounded by a lack of real opportunity to compete on the same playing field."
Gillibrand, at Sharpton's NYC MLK event after Biden spoke in DC, strikes a similar note on race: "We have to have an honest conversation about the systemic, institutional and daily individual acts of racism in our country that hold people and their families back."
RT @mollyhc: Harris was visibly not super psyched about this question. https://t.co/5dMAP15XrY

Biden: We’ve learned in the last two years it doesn’t take much to awaken hate. To bring those folks out from under the rocks
Biden tells mostly black audience at MLK event: There is something we, not you -- we, white America -- has to admit ... there is systematic racism.
Biden, once a tough on crime pol, notes that the criminal justice system is one of the problems today. "I haven't always been right."
Biden, after recalling Trump's "very fine people on both sides" comments, says, "We have to challenge these forces of hate.... this is not who we are."
MAGA contrast as Sharpton's MLK Day breakfast. Biden focuses on MLK's plea to "make America what it ought to be."
Bloomberg offers 2020 reference at Sharpton's MLK breakfast featuring Joe Biden: Whatever the next year brings for me and Joe I know we'll keep our eyes on the real prize, electing a Democrat
Sharpton: "We have hope that leadership will come to this country."

Here's some background by Stan Collender from the fall when there was some talk of ousting Paul Ryan with a privileged motion to vacate. https://t.co/DO0a7GhzJU
Looks like Pelosi will be having none of that intra-party rebellion Ryan and Boehner faced repeatedly from the right. This new rule for the House looks to end the ability of a single member to bring a motion to vacate the chair. https://t.co/BzxEmKWfrd
@McLaughlinnews Sounds about right.
McConnell: "As I've said repeatedly, the Senate will only be voting on a measure that's been agreed to by the Democrats and by the president, therefore guaranteeing a signature and a resolution."
McConnell, returning to the Capitol: "I don't think any particular progress was made today... We're hopeful that somehow in the coming days and WEEKS we'll be able to reach an agreement."
Democrats are asking the same question, for different reasons https://t.co/XrMruyXiVx

Think about that. The debate in DC on climate is not about figuring how to do the minimum needed to stem warming. It's about how to do much less than half. that's a perspective that has kids joining the Sunrise Movement and making videos like this: https://t.co/3fsTEdtsmi
Yet for skeptics and opponents in DC, a #GreenNewDeal that does half the job is just too much - an impossible, too-expensive overreach that could never pass even a Democratic-controlled Congress.
The context is interesting because yesterday an analysis by Carbon Brief estimated if the #GreenNewDeal met its goal of 100% clean energy by 2030, it would get only halfway to the emission targets needed to keep warming to 1.5 degrees C.	https://t.co/pGoJVaGAzC

One more thing about the #census. It supports $220 Billion in economic activity. Now there have been 2 decisions likely to cause undercounts. I explain why that costs businesses and the economy here: https://t.co/9BjYlk2dyc
Lastly, the citizenship question is the 2nd thing that will undercount Latinos. Ross already rejected a combined question on race and ethnicity that solves an artificial over count of white people at the expense of Latinos. Here are the test results for that question: https://t.co/TDo49RsMtQ
Predictably, the citizenship question is being addressed through the partisan prisms of immigration and elections. But undercounting Latinos in places like Texas means there aren't enough ambulances, police, road repairs, water supplies for everyone.
And because Congress had already drastically underfunded the Census compared to previous counts, several tests had already been dropped. One of the dropped tests involved advertising and outreach to people who might not answer.
Also, preparing #Census questions is a painstaking process. Items and methods are tested and peer-reviewed. the end-to-end test of the 2020 Census is already wrapping up, with no citizenship question.
Reminder. @RepJoseSerrano asked Secy Ross last week if it would be "totally inappropriate" to add an untested citizenship question to the #Census. Ross ducked, said it was still being considered, though sources told me it was a done deal. https://t.co/2L1jtCIsYB
So this happened a bit early. For an indication of how late in the game this #Census citizenship question is, the current end-to-end test of the 2020 census is happening already. There is no citizenship question on it, https://t.co/K7Qc35Xi2Q

@jiwallner The House is a different chamber? Now you’re just pulling my leg. There is no expectation that something will pass — if it doesn’t get a vote.
@jiwallner Cc Paul Ryan. Let’s see what they do with a Senate immigration bill.
@jiwallner You said “get Congress working”
@jiwallner Two words: hastert rule
@jiwallner You type faster than me. I will read that. I’m just saying partisanship has gotten more binding than rules which can in effect be changed with partisan floor votes.
@jiwallner Yes. Up until recent years. Now voting to overrule the chair is just another arrow in the quiver. Your suggestion of defying the party leader is at least as noteworthy. (Tho, nuking the legislative filibuster would still be pretty nuclear)
@jiwallner The “nuclear option” is a press-friendly PR phrase, usually used by the minority, invented when the senate and public still respected precedent. Now, it’s more nuclear when a member defies the party at a meaningful moment. Like McCain on healthcare.
@jiwallner Yes, but the nuclear option isn’t really the nuclear option either. It’s just using the rules to change precedent. It’s nuclear in sentiment.
