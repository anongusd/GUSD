@SheriffClarke @BreitbartNews @realDonaldTrump U dum
@jasoninthehouse U still Kompromat bro?
@jasoninthehouse u dum.
@PreetBharara Lindsey Graham must have been a terrible prosecutor.
@jacquisneal I think technically it’s not thousand island dressing. It’s thousand island plus secret ingredients.  I am going to give away the surprise ingredient right here though.  Thousand island dressing + two handfuls of sugar = secret sauce
@BobProtheroe @PreetBharara @matthewamiller He should be attorney general 2019, but he’s burned a bridge.  That will teach him to give his phone number out and then ghost men with tiny hands.
@LouiseMensch @BWallaceMP @Conservatives It’s astounding to me @GovernmentRF is going to pull off meddling in brexit and in 2016 election of Trump.  It’s stunning that it seems like the reason Russia will succeed is that they have so many politicians on the take.
@RepMarkMeadows I hope one day you come to see the dangers of your op-Ed comments that are misleading... and that’s it’s better suited for @FoxNews than congress.
I have turned into a news Junkie and I am perplexed why Jeffrey Epstein’s crimes weren’t talked about regularly.  Thanks @MuellerSheWrote podcast for teaching me about this recently.  I am sad national media hasn’t covered this much until today.
@DallasWoodhouse Man that’s excellent brand placement.  Make sure they agree to give you 5 seconds to plug your stuff from now on.
@RepMarkMeadows I haven’t seen him say that. I am seeing you lie a lot.  Makes me question your Christian character you claim to posses.  Can you or @GOP reconcile lies and your Christian faith?
@CloverChron this is a shameful site that @Twitter should remove
@sewwutnow @ItsJustJill @TwitterSupport should not allow these foreign entities to get money from @realDonaldTrump base with their #fakenews stories.  It’s dangerous
@RedNationRising I don’t think he’s trying to prove an expired parking meter.  @realDonaldTrump can’t afford a vehicle anyway he’s broke.  I think the special counsel might have some information regarding @GovernmentRF stuff though.
@DallasWoodhouse @ChairmanHayes @NCGOP @NCSBE Also, I think whataboutism and all that “both sides cheat but the dems cheat worse” is a load of garbage and I think any Christian pastors running for office should have a higher standard.  Shame on @MarkHarrisNC9 @ncbaptist @NCGOP for not having a higher standard.
@DallasWoodhouse @ChairmanHayes @NCGOP @NCSBE I think that in the name of the gospel @MarkHarrisNC9 should back out since his election is fruit of a sinfully poisonous tree and I think anyone in @NCGOP @GOP should prayerfully consider agreeing to another election.
@RepMarkMeadows I don’t think checks and balances applies to you bro... you and @MarkHarrisNC9 got that Russia money so you can cheat to stay in power no matter what.
@DivaLaci Good advice Scam Goddess.  Tell me about your latest scams.
@edgarmomplaisir @badcomixbyanna This is @edgarmomplaisir this weekend . https://t.co/ceRX96PLVN
You guys are all awesome I love all your shows!
Hey @DailyZeitgeist @jack_obrien @annahossnieh I might have missed the connection with you guys and the new show with Will Ferrell.  That’s awesome! Hopefully you can share some cool stories.  Get us some behind the scenes info to.
@RepMarkMeadows One thing to know about every congressman that takes up for @realDonaldTrump :  they get money from @Russia either directly or indirectly through @NRA
@RepMarkMeadows Your lies like this are why @wsoctv @WRAL should wonder why you say the things you say.  You are @MarkHarrisNC9 are both compromised and now you say crazy things.
Hey @replyall if you guys ever do a deep dive into how fake Facebook accounts attempt to get compromising information on folks I would love to share.  Seems like the person trying to get me has a pretty legit looking fake church and everything....
@badcomixbyanna Did you sit on @edgarmomplaisir ‘s dirty shorts again?
@badcomixbyanna You should write a lengthy document detailing what would be leaked if it were leaked like @JeffBezos .  One of mine is a super dirty pic of me with a tattered white t shirt with BBQ sauce all over its. The dirtiest part; I had the BBQ yesterday.
@GovMikeHuckabee You racist
@DallasWoodhouse @MarkHarrisNC9 @NCGOP God does not bless sin.
Every member of the @GOP @HouseGOP that voted to end the discussion with @MattWhitaker46 today should be voted out of office.  There’s no practical reason to do such a thing.  If it’s a witch hunt let it play out and be vindicated.  Are you all complicit or also compromised?
Hey @Sudo_Dr great job on the podcast today.  Looking forward to the desktop version!  If you ever need a beta tester that is new to the world of common sense privacy I would let to be your test subject with @MySudoApp :)
@Jacobs20Ronda @ChrisCoons @AP @evanvucci I am for sure an SNC pastor.  I am sick of watching my friends like @GovMikeHuckabee worship trump over Jesus and for just simply being liars.
If the @DNC really wants to expand their base or even extend and olive brand to some further to the right, Standing up for @ChrisCoons here would be a good start.  It is ok to pray for those you don’t agree with, right DNC?  This is a big deal for a lot of people in the south. https://t.co/DX8mg9MiNn
@ChrisCoons You did the right thing and I hope you get bipartisan effort for your biblical approach to this “issue”.  It should not be an issue to people of faith to pray for those with whom we disagree.
@ChrisCoons @AP @evanvucci I don’t care for any decision the dude makes either but I also pray for him often.  We should all pray for him to seek Jesus and to make Jesus lord.

@carly__bird @PreetBharara Thanks.  That’s one of the most insane statements I’ve ever seen.  That is why my doctorate from @LibertyU is no longer prominently on display.
@jwgop @JackKingston Please don’t judge @JackKingston like this he can’t help it.  It’s obvious he has an altered genetic code that causes him to have distinct delusions.  @GovMikeHuckabee suffers from this rare disorder as well.  I think it’s due to climate change.
@bartbarber I usually just crack jokes but this is an important topic to me. I think you can love and respect those that poured their lives out into us while knowing you might do things differently. It’s sad to me to watch my peers be snarky and disrespectful for people that have us chances.
Hey @PreetBharara my old friend Falwell has me blocked can you post a screenshot of his post you retweeted?  #askpreet
@realDonaldTrump I hope he is as bumbling and criminal as the rest of your cabinet.
@DallasWoodhouse @NCGOP @ChairmanHayes @RepMarkMeadows @realDonaldTrump And that is why the two party system is broken.  You stand with illegal immoral men, and I want a Conservative party with some morals that isn’t funded by @GovernmentRF

@DallasWoodhouse I had to look up who that person was... but I wholeheartedly agree.  That dead eyed gentleman they call @maroon5 was enjoying his performance as much as I was.  Levine should stay on reality tv and they should get full @Outkast
That @adamlevine character has the dead eyed glare of a serial killer as he performs at #SuperBowlLlll where is @rkelly ??

@DameJEMarshall @LindseyGrahamSC @FBI The power of komprimat is immense.
@LindseyGrahamSC Your questions are ridiculously irresponsible.  What position has @realDonaldTrump promised you?  It will save you a lot of heartache if you go ahead and resign your senate seat before I primary you and wi.  @SCGOP stands with me.

@RepMarkMeadows Hey man how’s @MarkHarrisNC9 doing?  How’s your friend Leslie Mccrae?
Hey @seanhannity I read that your lawyer @MichaelCohen212 is in a little trouble.  I am too inpatient to wait for @RonanFarrow @HuffPost or @ProPublica to eventually reveal your time involvement.  Can you just share what you did on the air?
@seanhannity Sure he should.  @realDonaldTrump should write it down like presidents used to do.  As for delivering it to a Joint Session of Congress, the idea of separation of powers would allow even someone like you @seanhannity to understand @POTUS isn’t to control Congress.
I think @NATO should send help to the USA since our government is frozen.  Maybe they can call @realDonaldTrump to explain the worldwide concerns in his desire to keep the government shut down.  I am positive @POTUS would receive advice from nato well.
I am disappointed in @realDonaldTrump as he is trying to fill the Void left behind by @HouseofCards Frank Underwood being gone.  President FU was able to speak before Congress.  @POTUS you have a lot to learn from @KevinSpacey .  @GOP make @VP the president :)
Instead of backing @realDonaldTrump on the shut down @MittRomney should be a leader and demand @senatemajldr step down.  The path to a compromise is by placing blame where it is due.  @GOP pick a new Senate Majority leader.
@STUinSD @Grumpyallday @ItsJustJill @Twitter @TwitterSupport How are things in @GovernmentRF today?
@STUinSD @Grumpyallday @ItsJustJill @Twitter @TwitterSupport That’s a lot of tweets to read.  Can you tell me what the primary sources are?
@STUinSD @Grumpyallday @ItsJustJill @Twitter @TwitterSupport I did.  I see no sources.  Can you send me links to the primary source documents ?  If I missed it I would like to apologize thanks for your help.
@STUinSD @Grumpyallday @ItsJustJill @Twitter @TwitterSupport What are your sources?
@Grumpyallday @ItsJustJill @STUinSD Fake news from a bot/troll account that links to a malicious site.  If @Twitter cared this would be a no brainer for @TwitterSupport to take down.
Hey @WhatCultureWWE @prowrestlingnet I randomly tuned into @WWE  smackdown last night and caught @reymysterio vs. Andrade.  Haven’t seen wrestling in years.  Am I wrong to think their match was absolutely fantastic? Is wwe always like this now?
@EBischoff Sports entertainment bro.  You are just better at it than most anyone else.  They are still in the era where everyone has to maintain kayfabe.  NFL should learn from you.

@AOC You are good at twittering.  Will you teach me how?
@jack_obrien @sSlytherinSal @Gwen_Dances @DailyZeitgeist Diaper sweaters are awesome
@NCPolAds Maybe he can loan you some money from his election fraud cash to get some assistance in makings gifs.
@JasonMillerinDC I will get back to trolling you later but for right now we are in agreement this is a crazy thing to run with without verification.
@JasonMillerinDC I am with you and your folks this time in that this was very irresponsible to report without verification especially when one writer has lied in the past.
@PressSec @realDonaldTrump @SpeakerPelosi What’s with the weird capitalization ? You guys scared to proof read for him?
@KatrinaPierson How’d you get this job?
Hey @milesofgray @jack_obrien please please let your Baptist Friend be on your @GovMikeHuckabee first episode.  Watching him gives me nausea but I just can’t stop watching it.  Also I would like to be Miles’ white slave when I gets that million per episode writing for Mike.

Just say @senatemajldr doesn’t care about hurting families.
I appreciate a funny joke when I see one... thanks @DallasWoodhouse I hope you can take @GovMikeHuckabee under your wing he’s stuff is painfully awkward. https://t.co/T7IQTjMUtN
@DallasWoodhouse Hey @DallasWoodhouse I’ve been giving you a hard time but this is genuinely funny.  Props to you! Both @NCDemParty and @NCGOP should give you a shout out and give credit where it is due.
@RepMarkMeadows @BrianEdward417 @POTUS Hey @MarkMeadows you went on break too man... I personally saw you twice and you had a five minute conversation with me. Are you a @DNC guy?  Or did @GOP go home too?  Doesn’t @POTUS currently live in DC?  Hope to see you and @MarkHarrisNC9 soon!
@jamieloftusHELP @whiterational Mensa people are weirdos.
@seanhannity Don’t post opinion pieces as fact shame on @thehill for this as well
May god have mercy on your souls for this blasphemy, lest he will lay the smack down on you all.
Hey @DailyZeitgeist @milesofgray @jack_obrien you can trash the pope, @POTUS , dead people, Gandhi , Jesus, Buddha... you can insult me or my kids or family, you can make jokes about the things I hold dear to my heart, but you’ve gone too far to speak ill of @TheRock .
@realdavegipson @SBCexplainer It has become the increasingly hard to tell the difference in Russian troll accounts and the accounts of sbc pastors.  As a troll I find this very confusing.  Actually I think the really good @GovernmentRF trolls look at some pastors tweets and think “wow that’s a little much”
@SBCexplainer That’s why I believe so much in the field of carpentry.  If God who took on flesh was a carpenter, then carpentry is the job of the holy, and what we all must aspire toward.
I want to thank @jacquisneal and @milesofgray for constantly talking about their use of @squattypotty I got one and everyone in the fam loves it.  Squatty needs to give y’all true squatters some as revenue
Hey @senatemajldr my neighbors are federal employees and have mortgage due in a few days and doctors appts for their sick kids.  Do you mind calling the bank to explain to them the circumstances?  Maybe @GOP can let them borrow some @NRA money that came from @GovernmentRF ?
@JudyWhaleCove @CassandraHeale1 @BlancaCamachoNY @JDiamond1 @gregpmiller As a conservative that worked for @GOP for a number of years, I would have to concur.  A two party system works if the two parties have standards of objective truth.  It’s probably damning if one party is funding by @GovernmentRF also.
@CassandraHeale1 @BlancaCamachoNY @JDiamond1 @gregpmiller I think the more global answer is:   Not much.  It seems like its gone beyond circumstances  where a lion of the party could tell him its best for the country to step down.  I hope I’m wrong and we rip the band aid off quickly
@JasonMillerinDC @POTUS You still compromised with all that dirt of you trying to hurt your pregnant mistresses?  Does @CNN  still pay you?
@BD_NCMAT @NCGOP @GKButterfield @RashidaTlaib @DallasWoodhouse If they aren’t trolling people, I can’t explain how they could say things.  It’s absurd.
@JackKingston Nah.
@DallasWoodhouse If it was news it would be written by a news organization.  I was thinking you are just the average @NCGOP leader and drank too much, but I’m starting to think you have a genuine malfunction somewhere in your brain.
@biblicalrecord I am saddened by the sinful nature of what @MarkHarrisNC9 has done and I’m deeply grieved by all of those that are turning a blind eye to his election fraud.  Shame on your news organization for attempting to gloss over his sinfulness.  Repent!
@realDonaldTrump I am not sure how you could impeach that fictitious president @realDonaldTrump .  However, given your situation and how different it is from the fantasy you typed above, I think you should be aware that impeachment is probably getting off easy for your treasonous behavior.
@DallasWoodhouse You are a liar.  You and I have both seen the evidence.  Its sickening you lie about this stuff because you know everyone else aware of it has the integrity not to speak on it.  Shame on you.
@LouiseMensch I like his suit and tie though.  At least his treason money got him some dope threads
@DallasWoodhouse @MarkHarrisNC9 @NCSBE @NCGOP The election results are not valid because you guys cheated.  It’s sad that people I used to truly admire and respect so much... guys like @MarkHarrisNC9 I emulated, turn out to be lying power hungry wannabe dictators.  @NCGOP repent.
@DallasWoodhouse @NCCapitol @ChairmanHayes @NCGOP @NC_Governor I have questions about this statement is there someone at @NCGOP that can discuss with me?
@emerydalesio @DallasWoodhouse @ChairmanHayes @NCGOP @NC_Governor They call nc a state that can “no longer be called a full democracy” for a reason... here you can see why as @MarkHarrisNC9 will be seated because of these acts by @NCGOP and nc media like @wsoctv @NCCapitol hesitate to fully cover it out of fear of angering gop haze.
@emerydalesio @DallasWoodhouse @ChairmanHayes @NCGOP @NC_Governor They don’t want anyone to talk about that election fraud stuff.  So the best way to get a man seated and to keep the dozens of others complicit in the crime out of trouble... don’t put anyone on the board that would oversee the election results.	 Supermajority authoritarianism?
@DallasWoodhouse @NCCapitol @ChairmanHayes @NCGOP @NC_Governor I wonder if you think what you type makes sense or if you just know the @NCGOP / @realDonaldTrump base will love your gibberish?
@DallasWoodhouse @NCGOP @MyNCSenate @NCHouseGOP Your grammar sucks.  You guys should divert some of your election fraud money over to social media management... you guys look so incredibly amateur to be an organization that takes after the mob.  Step it up @DallasWoodhouse u dum
@DallasWoodhouse @NCGOP I thought your head was photoshopped on to someone else’s body.  Turns out @DallasWoodhouse you just have a really disproportional head to neck ratio.
@DallasWoodhouse He didn’t subpoena Santa again did he?  I thought it was the real people your employees tricked?  Did they trick Santa?
@DallasWoodhouse @NCGOP The @NCGOP will sue, cheat, lie, steal gerrymander, and go so far as to have heretical liars like @DallasWoodhouse at the helm to remain in power.
@jdgreear That’s hilarious.  You wrote the gospel.  You should send him an amazon link to your book.
@bartbarber @ryanwalling @jdgreear I disagree.  You as SBC most interesting man of the decade must agree with me on everything or you are a heretic.  Isn’t that what Matthew 23 is all about?  If you don’t agree with this tweet you’re also a heretic.  Basically you’re a heretic if you aren’t me.
@JuddLegum @DallasWoodhouse It sounds like Dallas might be indulging in some kind of mind altering substance while on vacation.  When in Florida do as the Floridians I suppose.
@JuddLegum I should have just handed off info to you instead of the board of elections.  I think there just isn’t much anyone can do at this point to stop @NCGOP or to even work toward level playing field down the road... they’ve really got solid control unfortunately.
@MarkHarrisNC9 @MarkGarrisonWBT Mark you need to do the right thing.  All those times you told me and my cohort at @SEBTS the importance of biblical integrity and it’s looking like you have none.  Come clean.  Personally call for a new section.  I pray you would repent and stop w @NCGOP lies.
@RaleighReporter @DallasWoodhouse @WakeMed Congrats!
Hey @DallasWoodhouse @NCGOP I think I can link Dallas @MarkHarrisNC9 @RepMarkMeadows to Mccrae.  Do you all know each other real well?  Do you mind if I post some information I have from my political involvement in the past?
@matt_pociask @MicheleNixNCGOP @NCGOP Nah.  I say when in doubt frantically try to pull for which ever side keeps you out of jail for being complicit in voter fraud.  Ain’t that right @NCGOP ?  I’ve been holding back @DallasWoodhouse would you like me to post some info I have about you guys and your connections?
@MicheleNixNCGOP @NCGOP He’s not duly elected.  I guess @MicheleNixNCGOP is guilty of also playing a role in this for a long time as well.  It’s time @NCGOP come clean and start on a path to having normal politics in their state.  Repent of your lies and fraud.
@DallasWoodhouse @MarkHarrisNC9 You look stupid.  You lack dignity and you lack class and you seem to be devoid of honesty.  Shame on you and shame on any Christian person that covers for you @DallasWoodhouse @NCGOP
@ryanobles @DallasWoodhouse @WayneGoodwinNC The @NCGOP leader @DallasWoodhouse seems drunk... or really scared he is going to go to jail when it comes out he knew about this.  These guys and @RepMarkMeadows have been working in lock step since the marriage amendment of 2010... @CNN do some investigation and tie it together
@DallasWoodhouse @ChairmanHayes @NCGOP @NCSBE I hope @fbi finds out you have been in on this all along.  I am certainly willing to help share all I know about you and @NCGOP as well.
@stranahan How many hoes deep is it?  How many hoes are you in deep with on any given day?  Snoop dog once said he does not love them hoes... are your hoes different or do you just love them unlovable hoes that snoop did not love?
@JoeBrunoWSOC9 @wsoctv I hope @wsoctv never lets @MarkHarrisNC9 forget the egregious sin he has committed that he refuses to repent of and turn from. I bet you guys will move on and treat him as completely legitimate.  @NancyPelosi will seat him to avoid the fight. @NCGOP crooks.
@JoeBrunoWSOC9 @wsoctv Everyone can tweet all day long but this is the consequence of getting this far along into an undemocratic state with gerrymandering and whatnot.  @MarkHarrisNC9 will get seated no matter what... since one federal judge in nc appointed by trump is compromised as well.
@JuddLegum If they were all aware of it and know that in our climate today, no one will believe an entire party could be engaging in massive election fraud unless there are primary source documents, wouldn’t you do the same thing to make it all private as well :)

@PeteKaliner @maddow @RepMarkMeadows @NCGOP I would kindly appreciate you taking down that insane accusation but I don’t expect this request to be anything more than fodder for your talk show.  No further need for us to communicate whatsoever from this point forward I am shocked your mind would go to such an insane place.
@PeteKaliner @maddow @RepMarkMeadows @NCGOP You’re the king of Twitter trolling;I play on this account because I have a real life psychopath of a relative who constantly searches for me.  I removed the tweets about @RepMarkMeadows but i will be back to say I told you so in a few days.
@PeteKaliner @maddow @RepMarkMeadows @NCGOP Absence of evidence is not evidence of absence.  :)
@PeteKaliner @mjrusher @NCGOP That’s the I’m rubber and you’re glue argument.  It’s based in lunacy especially if you claim to be a journalist.  You imply that your side never does wrong.

@mjrusher @PeteKaliner You guys disappoint me.  This is a clear cut rational decision to stand against election fraud.. whether its Mark Harris or a democrat.  Stand up for something and don’t continue to muddy the waters by trying to make it seem more acceptable for @NCGOP candidate to cheat to win.
@NCGOP @DallasWoodhouse @HallieJackson I am glad you are taking the position to have another election.  You should stick with this honorable road and just replace Harris.

@realDonaldTrump 87 pages written by you and @EricTrump and @RudyGiuliani is like 3 pages written by anyone else.  I bet this “counter report” will contain no less than 20 blatantly illegal attempts to obstruct justice.
@realDonaldTrump The court filings today must be real juicy.  I can’t wait to see what you’re so upset about.
@PeteKaliner @NCGOP @RepPittenger Party leaders.  I understand marks appeal to the people
@DallasWoodhouse @NCGOP That was the lamest desperate attempt at deflection I’ve ever seen in my life.  You do admit you think election fraud happened though now right @DallasWoodhouse ?
Hey @PeteKaliner question... why didn’t @NCGOP like @RepPittenger ?
@56keg @PeteKaliner There is nothing about what you said that makes sense.  You should study the Russians a bit more so you can learn to be a more effective troll.

@YouNicks @BrianEdward417 @JuddLegum @wsoctv Thanks.  I keep using those terms interchangeably when they are not necessarily to be used in such a way.  Have a good day!
@BrianEdward417 @YouNicks @JuddLegum @wsoctv Do you hate me more if I think the best wrestler in history is hbk?
@BrianEdward417 @YouNicks @JuddLegum @wsoctv Mark Harris is a personal friend and I am a conservative.  However I believe we can agree that voter fraud is bad and needs to be investigated fully.  My position would be the same no matter who this involved.
@BrianEdward417 @YouNicks @JuddLegum @wsoctv Why you so mad bro?  Infowars not soothing enough to ease your rage?  Can I have a position that all voter fraud is bad and if dems do it let’s talk about it... the best way to quell all voter fraud is to start holding people accountable, that means Mark Harris.
@tedlieu @MarkHarrisNC9 They knew about it all.  Mark has known some of these people for a long time.  Ask @RepMarkMeadows about these guys they worked in his district too.
@kpills @seanhannity He’s funny but he’s a cheap rip off of @BurgundyPodcast

@bartbarber I’ve considered just going off into the woods to die from shortness of breath in secret.
@ManuelErnestoG @AndySpecht When you help tons of people including the sheriff get elected you basically just get to tell them how big your family is during voting season.  Maybe he’s got more sons than father Abraham?
RT @AndySpecht: How normal is it for someone to seek more than 400 absentee applications?		#NC9 #ncpol https://t.co/jncdhmN4ZJ
@AndySpecht Can you post a link for this?  I like seeing all the people I know through Mark Harris being all famous for their diligent work collecting ballots :)
@PeteKaliner I try to scoop up 200-400 absentee ballots every other November myself.  Do you not participate in “mo’ fraud November”?  Maybe it’s supposed to be “no fraud” I dunno I’m pretty sure @NCGOP told me more fraud. #nc09
@PeteKaliner @j_hauser9 @wsoctv Dowless just does what he’s told and paid to do.  I’m not sure political affiliation matters.  Really it’s a better scam to make both parties complicit that way no side will ever fully call for investigations.
@j_hauser9 @NCGOP @DallasWoodhouse What about issues outside of the 650 or so absentee ballots?  Destroyed ballots?  Why not just patiently wait or actively assist in getting to the bottom of the issue.  Seems like you all look less guilty if you let it play out to the end.
@j_hauser9 @NCGOP @DallasWoodhouse Your math sucks and is inaccurate does not take into account all of the votes.
@JoeBrunoWSOC9 I think @RepPittenger should weigh in with his support of a complete investigation before certification, including the primary election.  It’s not holding it hostage from the @NCGOP since it’s not theirs to begin with, it belongs to the people of #NC09
@JoeBrunoWSOC9 Tell @NCGOP that this did sway the election.  It’s incredibly sinful to insist inaccuracies.  Tell them also that they should come clean about how common place this is and @DallasWoodhouse should confess that he knows about this and knows dowless.
@SharayahColter @RealSaavedra @CNN I think the piece they did about the fake Dead Sea scrolls at @swbts was good.
Delete your twitter.  Call dowless.  Have him drive your white ford bronco down the highway to @NCGOP very slowly.  Then turn yourself in and write a book later called “if I committed election fraud” https://t.co/1GyPSEG4jR

@JoeBrunoWSOC9 @wsoctv It shouldn’t be hard to place a few calls to tie mark to dowless and to see this is something a lot more wide spread than just one race and one district.  Dm me if you need some help threading the needle :)
@HappyMiddleNC @pagesturnedblog @baseballot @DallasWoodhouse @RepPittenger He did his job.  They wanted Harris in.
@pagesturnedblog @baseballot @DallasWoodhouse Dallas can’t because he’s complicit.  It’s how the scam works once you know what’s going on you’re guilty as well thus you play the game and lie lie lie to try to make sure you never get in trouble yourself.

@arjav_rawal He’s spent a ton of time in bladen county the last few years.  Preaching at first baptist Dublin all the time, catching up with old friends in the dowless family,making sure the @NCGOP continues its money laundering operation through churches, etc.

Hey @BowTiePolitics great job on @FiveThirtyEight !  Are you the guy that can explain to me how you guys voted for trump and a Democratic governor?  Also do you have links about the primary irregularities involving district 9?
@NorthcentralU You guys have called me over 100 times from 15 different numbers in a week when I was inquiring about your school.  I’ve written and called requesting you to stop.  How do you educate your students to keep @NorthcentralU from illegal harassment?
@Keith_Tkr @_PPatterson_ He should do as he said for the sake of many southern Baptists that mentored under him like myself and @jdgreear and just ride off into the sunset like a cowboy.
@_PPatterson_ I’ve known you for the better part of 40 years and I’ve learned you’re a racist a liar and a crook. I bet their deal just wasn’t financially acceptable to you and you are making it out to be something it is not.  You still have stolen documents from @SEBTS ?
Hey @FoxNews it turns out... no one misses you guys.  Might as well sign your Fox News account over to me I will just cover news about foxes, the animals and not be a propaganda arm of the @GOP
@jamieloftusHELP I always secretly hoped I was your favorite.  Thank you for this confirmation.  Next time you see me drinking my thick nectar you can just shout out “hey cranky” and we can be friends irl
@jamieloftusHELP It could be worse.  You could be like @edgarmomplaisir and be “semi frequent podcast guest”
@Lindacur @FoxNews @realDonaldTrump @SarahPalinUSA Big talk from a poorly groomed poodle.  Is any of what I said untrue?  You to be to loyal to a fault.
@BL_Ranch @SarahPalinUSA I would keep crying but I’ve cried so much over @realDonaldTrump putting kids in cages, breaking the law, dividing our nation, etc, I am so numb I don’t have many tears left.  At least I had tears rather than you fake Christian zealots who fall for @SarahPalinUSA and her mess
I have a question for California friend @milesofgray and @jack_obrien ... why are these hash tags about fires ending with James woods’ name? https://t.co/7Pr7JENL09
@Lindacur Yes I am very old, so old in fact I can recall a time when poodles weren’t allowed on Twitter.  Calm down bot/troll or @FoxNews devotee it’s cool your brand of racism headed by @realDonaldTrump and @SarahPalinUSA is going strong.
RT @JerryDunleavy: I love this viral video of an old man draining free throws.	https://t.co/w1EItKflOU
@SarahPalinUSA You were the catalyst for this polarization and you back a racist man who is an agent of the country you claim you can see from your backyard.  I suggest you calm down polarizing a nation and blaming dems when you’re the original hateful fear mongering lunatic Trump emulates.
@milesofgray @DailyZeitgeist In these rebound episodes can you just let @jack_obrien speak off the cuff about his conspiracy theories?  Just start with his conspiracy theme music.  Maybe at breaks you can find some more Quincy Jones interviews to read to us.

Hey @milesofgray @DailyZeitgeist I’m nervous about this election stuff. I am going to retreat into the utopia of red dead redemption 2 so I can continue to see the gospel of John Marston.Wild West gunslinging is more comforting than current events.  If dems lose do a dog episode
@LindseyGrahamSC @BarackObama @realDonaldTrump U sold out.  Keep your senate seat warm for me you are making it must easier for me to beat you in the next election.
Hey @jonlovett @PodSaveAmerica today’s a good day to start praying Red Dead Redemption 2.  Turn off your phone for a while have @jonfavs attach the results to Pundit late at night, and just enjoy the utopia of the murderous Wild West of RDR2.
@jack_obrien Exactly.  My 3 year old was up at 6am today.  Someone should campaign on ending this insane time change.  Whoever promises to stop the madness has my vote.
Hey @SteveKingIA don’t worry about being compared to a recent domestic terrorist bro, we know your deep seeded racism and neo nazi views that you openly admit to are long standing, unwavering and frighteningly methodical.  @GOP @FoxNews @SpeakerRyan have you as their token nazi
Thanks @DailyZeitgeist and Jamie of @BechdelCast for helping me understand what a patient was trying to tell me in a behavoral health hospital yesterday. I thought “rabbit rabbit” and the response of “tigger tigger” were all part of the hallucinations.

@realDonaldTrump No need to vote to elect @BrianKempGA .  He will eventually suppress enough votes where the @GOP will never lose.  Shame on @GaRepublicans for not allowing democracy to run it’s natural course by not allowing black people to vote.
@JasonMillerinDC @michelleinbklyn I have trouble with the fact you drugged a woman and put her in a coma so you could abort her unborn child to cover up your affair.  Good spokesman you have here @GOP
@EWErickson Just false.  You are way too second rate to have a news scoop in the first place.  The video is very poorly made by the way. The “duplicate” twins would each be allowed a vote, and the numbers are patently false.   @BrianKempGA knows he is keeping black people from voting.
@UConnJack69 @Brendy438 @seanhannity Fake account.  @Twitter you are not helping the world have better discourse.
I hope it was @realDonaldTrump that has the winning #MegaMillionsJackpot  #MegaMillons ticket.  If so he can finally pay off all that debt he owes @GovernmentRF .  Don’t share your lotto money with @SteveDoocy @foxandfriends he’s creepy.
I want to know when the “flex with your lexicon” shirts will be available from @DailyZeitgeist @EricLampaert .  I would like to buy several.
@GOP @realDonaldTrump Annnnd we also have a deficit because of the tax cuts that means @SpeakerRyan and @tedcruz will finally get their way to get Medicare and Medicaid just to make up for the loss of giving the mega rich mega tax cuts.

@AnthonyCaraturo @DineshDSouza @realDonaldTrump @POTUS I have decided your grasp of pop culture and the English language is so lacking you can’t possibly be a bot.  Sorry about that please continue on hitting me with your outdated burns.
@JackKingston U dum.  They don’t want ur @GovernmentRF money.
@AnthonyCaraturo @DineshDSouza @realDonaldTrump @POTUS Please accept my apology if this is a real person that is just under the influence of propaganda.  Your writing was so piss poor I just assumed you were a bot. I know what I get when I ASSume though... we get a compromised president a lot of whataboutism from his cult.
@rayshell75 @DineshDSouza It’s not true.  Simple explanation of how he comes up with the stories.  He is a snake oil salesman style hustle and a pathological liar that manipulates people via fear mongering, so it’s natural for terrible people like him to come up with insane lies.  Liars gonna lie.
@AnthonyCaraturo @DineshDSouza Hey bot it’s sad a foreign power is winning in its propaganda campaign against USA.  I guess when @realDonaldTrump @POTUS is in on the operation you can’t stop it.
@DineshDSouza This is crazy @GovernmentRF style propaganda.  @JimAcosta didn’t do that what an absurd claim.  However when I hear about #DeathofaNation I put both hands to my throat with the choking sign because the stench of garbage takes my breath away.  Maybe it was @jaketapper ?
Hey @jamieloftusHELP are you still in @AmericanMensa ?  Thinking about getting 25 of my closest friends to join up and then we can have our own weird Mensa private groups.  No mean talk though just dirty nerd talk to make those predators jealous.

@LPCampbell @jamieloftusHELP I also reported like 200 tweets from those @AmericanMensa people... the way they think it’s funny to make murder jokes is terrifying.  A lot of them are in to Q anon as well.  Seemed like an easy mistake @Twitter could have fixed same day glad Jamie is back!
@jamieloftusHELP I couldn’t help you and your friends topple the Olympics people, but the weirdos at @AmericanMensa were not as formidable.  Great to have you back!  I probably annoyed your friends tagging them in my shenanigans... I threw a tantrum to make sure I got noticed haha
@jamieloftusHELP Do you like bacon?
@IwriteOK @Twitter Seems like they definitely just read the teeet inaccurately or some algorithm didn’t quite get the gist of what was being said... doesn’t seem like @Twitter @TwitterSupport cares to correct a mistake or that @AmericanMensa wants to distance themselves from the real culprit.
Hey @RepHollyGrange a friend showed me a mailer you sent out last week.  Have you ever considered a campaign where you stand solely on your values instead of misrepresenting those of your opponent?  I think I’m going to help him run against you if you win next month...
@jacquisneal I’ve always considered you and @edgarmomplaisir my best friends.
@kleegrubaugh @LindseyGrahamSC Prime example of a fake account.
@LindseyGrahamSC 400,000 of them are bots.  The rest will be voting for me when I unseat you when you run for re-election.  Don’t get too excited you power hungry hack... the new red wave of new conservatives is going to wipe you and your friends out of office.
@_PPatterson_ Awesome is this going to be a website that will serve as a library for all the documents you stole from @SEBTS ?  Or will it be a memoir of you have bullied and blackmailed and lied your way to sbc prominence?  Maybe how you mentored @jdgreear and you cover up sexual assault?
@SharayahColter @Scotus @GOP How’s @_PPatterson_ ?  You guys still covering for him?  Birds of sexual assault cover ups flock together?
@DineshDSouza You are Bret Kavanaugh in a lot of ways @DineshDSouza .  Drug addicted violent lunatics that lie more than they tell the truth.  You guys are like brothers from different mothers.
I think @SenatorCollins should have some trouble sleeping tonight after a multitude of lies she just told.  I guess selling your soul to @GOP better than selling to satan.  Let us know if it’s worth it.  Maybe @realDonaldTrump will embrace you now.
@GovMikeHuckabee Good joke @GovMikeHuckabee here’s not to show you’re not a good @PressSec : you lie to the press and the American public despite the fact you claim to be a Christ follower.  Also, you were a terrible elected official and ended up being a propaganda hack at @FoxNews
@kilmeade @foxandfriends He appeared as a son father and husband with anger and drinking problems.  Can @FoxNews asked if he has ever been intoxicated while presiding over a case?
@ScottJenningsKY Funny I will do the same for you in what pathological liars look like.
@c4sadler @rhpbfh @morkrazy @TreyFett @badcomixbyanna @culturekingspod Too bad @AmericanMensa is cool with their members making death threats and possibly sexually assaulting during Mensa meetings.  Too bad @FBI wrong do anything but they should be investigated for sure
@morkrazy @TreyFett @badcomixbyanna @culturekingspod Mensa is complete trash I say.  The vile things you guys said needs to be exposed to the world.  Discuss the content of what was posted like the death threat the @FBI should investigate, or just concede to your intellectual superior. I’m smarter than most people don’t be ashamed
Seriously in googling them they seem disturbed with lots of allegations around.  Be careful and let them come after my organs... little known fact I have an underdeveloped third nipple so they might be confused has to how to get to my organs anyways. R 3 nips hot? @BechdelCast
For the alt right sounding weirdos they are.  Something this stuff is more a mans job so tell her to just hang back relax smell some flowers braid some hair and just let kind of a real man kind of try to handle these scary people.
@caitlindurante if you see this please let Jamie know that for whatever reason those @AmericanMensa guys set off all kinds of red flags with me while also infuriating me with their nonsense.  Tell her that her white male cranky baptist friend is ready to expose #mensaresponds
So just perform the first few minutes and see where it goes I’m sure you can turn it back to @DailyZeitgeist somehow.  It’s one of my favorite songs and it’s fun!

@DJJenkins I turned on my iPhone camera and stuck it my shirt pocket like 6 years ago at a deacons meeting I knew would be contentious.  It’s hilarious to me @FoxNews thinks this is a new invention! Haha!
Why does @CNN have people like @ScottJenningsKY on their programs?  He’s rude disrespectful and dismissive and he seemed to be outright lying.  I miss when @GOP had a strong thread of Biblical Christianity within it because liars are sinners and sinners need to repent.
Good move @OrrinHatch on dismissing women like you did and telling them to grow up.  Since you are 145 years old seems like everyone has a lot of growing up to do.  Come to grips with the 21st century Sir.
@tophaloaph You should do a little google searching of the man they are defending.  I didn’t know much about Mensa other than I thought it was cool to take the test a long time ago, but it’s very unsettling to me.  Hoping @TwitterSupport reconsiders and they #freejamie https://t.co/eVQsCO3Z9r

@rhpbfh @morkrazy @TreyFett @badcomixbyanna @culturekingspod @AmericanMensa @FBI @Wraths_Scion I don’t know if that’s true or not but seems like it could be a trend of violence in the weird cult of @AmericanMensa @badcomixbyanna tell Jamie not to feel bad she’s probably not the only one that Gino threatened to kill and @SEMichiganMensa overlooked or covered it up. https://t.co/5Qmo5ZkDmf
@TShadrick @TGHStephanie I hope you didn’t go on a date with this organ harvester or whatever he calls himself.  You should listen to the @BechdelCast and get some advice from them before you date.  Here my pro tip: don’t date @AmericanMensa members that make death threats.
What does this mean?  @culturekingspod should interview this creepy dude that makes death threats AND apparently eats cans!  @AmericanMensa what’s up with this dude and your group in general? https://t.co/LjknWu66WK
@Chobee1Kenobi @badcomixbyanna I’m convinced @SEMichiganMensa has bots or something based on their ignorance of the responses to this topic.  Mensa America has banned me so I am just going to @ random Mensa branches from now on.
@Chobee1Kenobi @badcomixbyanna I don’t think they ban you for making screenshots of a @facebook group on @Twitter that’s kind of a silly thing for a #mensa member to say.  You want to discuss the death threats that dude made?
@rhpbfh @morkrazy @TreyFett @badcomixbyanna @culturekingspod @AmericanMensa @FBI @Wraths_Scion @lbakerink Yo @SEMichiganMensa is your account run by @AmericanMensa communications director?  Care to comment on death threats, taking up for men that make death threats or anything like that?  I don’t think @facebook loves you guys making death threats even in private groups. @FBI
@rhpbfh @morkrazy @TreyFett @badcomixbyanna @culturekingspod @AmericanMensa @FBI @Wraths_Scion Hey @lbakerink as someone who runs the Mensa non profit can you guys comment how you feel about the death threats made to this young woman?  Can you comment about the gross violent perverted subculture of @AmericanMensa I am learning about?
.@AmericanMensa what’s up with you guys being cool with your members making death threats and threatening to hack those that ask questions?  Are you guys a cult?  Help me understand.   #MensaResponds
@rhpbfh @morkrazy @TreyFett @badcomixbyanna @culturekingspod I think #mensaresponds is about the creepiest thing I’ve ever seen.  Will @AmericanMensa actually respond?  If not I genuinely think @FBI should look into this Gino guys constant death threats.  @Wraths_Scion said death threats are common in #mensa
@rhpbfh Hey @badcomixbyanna have you looked at these @AmericanMensa accounts trashing Jamie?  They seem to be Q anon people. Someone should tell them @BechdelCast Jamie has Q clearance as well.
@Wraths_Scion @rhpbfh @jamieloftusHELP In all fairness when people use SJW they usually are alt right Nazis or at least sympathetic to the cause.  So misogyny is probably one of the least serious aspects of your collective personality at @AmericanMensa
@Wraths_Scion @rhpbfh @dj_danl This is probably the dumbest thing I’ve ever heard.  I hope #mensaresponds with an apology and I hope @FBI #fbi responds to a death threat and you saying he’s many many death threats.  @nytimes or someone should write a piece of how troubling @AmericanMensa seems to be.
@rockstar2010 @rhpbfh @MamaMac_ @dj_danl Seems like we should address the death threat first.  I think the @FBI should take interest in a death threat by a member of @AmericanMensa where it appears the organization is aware of this death threat and others and does not report or take action.
@rhpbfh @Wraths_Scion @dj_danl You guys seem unwilling to answer direct questions.  Is this guy that threatened to kill her still part of @AmericanMensa ?
@Wraths_Scion @AmyMK @jamieloftusHELP I don’t know if anyone expects creepy veiled death threats at a barroom... where are you nerds drinking at where people sound like serial killers?  @DailyZeitgeist should do an episode on @AmericanMensa this is very disturbing to me.
@morkrazy @TreyFett @badcomixbyanna @culturekingspod I would be willing to call Mensa trash.  You guys cool with that dude threatening to kill her?
@badcomixbyanna I would sincerely hope that was like some kind of algorithmic block and that a live human would correct it... but I don’t have much faith in @TwitterSupport to do the right thing anymore.

@FoxNews @POTUS Fighting hard to continue to be an alcoholic with a bad temper that sexually assaults women.  It’s a tough thing to balance as a federal judge.
@jamieloftusHELP Yep then I hit reset on life and make so much less money.  So now I kind of wish I was the person I swore I would never be.
Hey @yusefroach as the only baptist that lives in the Deep South that is part of the #zeitgang I think you were awesome on @DailyZeitgeist @milesofgray @jack_obrien you guys need to put this guy on track to be alongside @edgarmomplaisir @jamieloftusHELP as most frequent guest!
Best way to start my morning is some dog food breakfast meat and listening to @DailyZeitgeist @milesofgray @jack_obrien @annahossnieh .  How come I’m the only one here that orders corned beef hash? https://t.co/9kQF4EHKnt
@kilmeade @foxandfriends So he’s become exactly like @kilmeade and @foxandfriends ?  Pot calling kettle black?  Nah I don’t think that fights no way you guys would be mistaken for anything other than white (supremacists).
@FoxNews @kanyewest You guys should stop taking advantage of a mentally ill person in @kanyewest
@jacquisneal If the man that helped you do sketchy stuff like war crimes and violating international agreements was nominated to slide into a position where he would likely never be compelled to snitch, you would send some texts too.
@TheMarkPantano @JeffFlake You are a lunatic and lack the charisma to be an actual cult leader.  I am sorry you are such a poor communicator you can’t get noticed even by #gop @GOP @realDonaldTrump
@FoxNews @AlanDersh You gonna dismiss @AlanDersh now that he isn’t in line with your thinking?
@kilmeade @TomFitton I think everyone lost in this other than you dirtbags at the state run propaganda machine @FoxNews #foxnews

@GovMikeHuckabee @realDonaldTrump Go to sleep weirdo
@FoxNews Kavanaugh should be drug tested and given a breathalyzer then everyone should slow down the process
@milesofgray Here’s the question they should ask.  Judge Kavanaugh will submit to a breathalyzer test and a urine drug screening right now?  $1000 says he wouldn’t agree.
Hey @DineshDSouza your hashtags never catch on you aren’t as witty as @POTUS @realDonaldTrump @CNN @GOP @DNC #dineshisdumb
@DineshDSouza Can’t argue with a blasphemous felon that is a piss poor debater and an 8th reading level.. better do what @DineshDSouza says he’s always been a power player in the @GOP .  Your hash tag also did  not catch on.
@jacquisneal The dude appears just like every angry drunk that’s ever come into my church office to explain to me angrily how the world has done them wrong and it has nothing to do with their addiction.  Someone should give the man a breathalyzer test on the spot.
Hey @jonlovett @crookedmedia do you think you can get @RonanFarrow to consider calling his team the Ronan Warriors?  It would be great Merch and the series was awesome too. https://t.co/EK5Eh1jmSB
@LindseyGrahamSC @chrislhayes @seanhannity @FoxNews @ChickfilA Gotta fuel up before you cover for racists and get all fussy.  Chic-Fil-a is going to fund my campaign again you Senator Graham so don’t get so attached to the company that will hep unseat you.
@GOPoversight do you all provide oversight to this Kavanaugh stunt and perjury?  What do you provide oversight to?  The president keeping himself from indictment?
@GOP why support an alcoholic rapist?  Plenty of other justices out there.  Why also allow @GovernmentRF to use trolls to boost your @Twitter traffic?
Every time I’ve ever had an intervention with an alcoholic they responded just like Kavanaugh did today.  It’s not an emotional appeal it’s the psychopathy of an addict.  Drug test your nominee @ChuckGrassley
@GOP Don’t forget some of those women Have rescinded their support.  By the way @LindseyGrahamSC the @SCGOP has reached out to say they will fund me if I primary you if you don’t retire.  Good luck to you my friend.  Just playing you’re a monster the people of SC will vote you out.
@glennbeck @kleegrubaugh Nope.  You’re both insane.  Side with a sex predator all long if you want. Even if 60% of Americans agree with sex predators it doesn’t make rape ok.  You should be ashamed find Jesus and turn from your sin.

I always wondering why @gop wouldn’t just push out @POTUS @realDonaldTrump for @VP but today I learned... Pence is just as discipicble as Trump.  Your Supreme Court nominee is a sex predator you are complicit in allowing a man to shame his victims.  Repent you awful man.
@jacquisneal I was a republican for a long time.  I am still a devout Christian.  None of what I see played out regarding sexual assault victims remotely resembles how the Bible would instruct us to act.  It makes me very sad to watch.
@kilmeade @LindseyGrahamSC @BenSasse @foxandfriends They mark the end of the @GOP being the party with a moral compass.  It’s shameful.  I hope any of you that claim to be Christians stop dragging Jesus through the mid with your partisan hateful shaming of sexual assault victims.
Hey @LindseyGrahamSC screenshot this let the @GOP @SCGOP @FoxNews @CNN @seanhannity know after your ridiculous outburst of anger toward sexual assault victims a new Conservative party is coming for your seat and I will personally unseat you... or you make it that long. #beashamed

@DailyZeitgeist @edgarmomplaisir @culturekingspod Hey @edgarmomplaisir I may or may not live in NC, but not only is my tv nice,  I own a kitchen table.  I remember you saying you didn’t have one.

@realDonaldTrump You didn’t question @GovernmentRF .  You also didn’t ask the question whether or not you could touch those ladies.  You also didn’t ask the question if @FLOTUS as to whether or not you could have sex with a porn star.  Also do you question @foxandfriends ?
@kilmeade @PressSec @foxandfriends @ainsleyearhardt should never ever claim to know Christ and then go out to knowing push lies every day.  It’s sinful and shameful
@kilmeade @PressSec @foxandfriends It’s not true just because the pathological liar @PressSec says it.  Shame on your show for perpetuating lies.
There is a lot of good unhealthy food, but not much theatre.  Still a nice place with some really awesome people there.  Have fun!!
We used to live in Charlotte it’s the biggest city with the least to do in a lot of ways.  If you drive to the beach hit me up we will treat you to an all you can eat crab leg buffet. You can see by this thesis....
Also you could rent a car and drive to Durham which has @DPAC and could be having a good show.  Or drive 3 hours to the beach haha.
There isn’t much good theatre.  There are some good comedy clubs you could support some up and coming guys trying to get a break.  Also try @Bojangles1977 if you haven’t tried them.
Hey @J_Keith I did what @milesofgray and paused the podcast to tell you what’s popping in Charlotte.  Go to @BadDaddysBurger it’s a treat you can get a burger with bacon growing into the beef or you can get one of the best ahi tuna sandwiches oh the world.
@PhrozinNy @IwriteOK This is a very good point.  I got to be really good at checking every single drawer just in case and then hauling it all back somewhere.  I think that game makes us all great survivalists.

@SenThomTillis I think they just want to see his record in totality and you guys @GOP are withholding documents.  Right?
@AskeBay is there any way to contact you all via email or chat immediately when I seem I’ve been scammed or do I have to wait and go through your lengthy process before I am allowed to write to @eBay? Seems sketchy I can’t contact directly whenever I need to do so.

@AliVelshi He’s sad.  You guys should just ignore him for 24 hours and watch how restless he will get.  If you and @CNN ignore him all day he will probably confess to every crime he’s ever committed in a cry for attention.

@POTUS and his team should take a few moments to give a press release worthy of such a man as McCain and the legacy he leaves behind.
I bet @realDonaldTrump should go to bed early tonight... tv will be filled with stories about a man who was a war hero and a man who would put country over party.  A man that treated political adversaries with great respect in disagreement.
@realDonaldTrump I thought you were the greatest business man ever.  You can’t even first an employee in Sessions that you don’t like.  I am quickly losing faith in you if you can’t rid yourself of a non loyal dude like Sessions. Restore my #maga hope @POTUS
I’ve had a realization #Trumpers the president doesn’t have the courage or the courage of a bold leader to fire sessions.  If i have employees that don’t have my back they are gone.  @realDonaldTrump is all talk and no gumption.  He’s weak and has always been weak. Prove me wrong
@ChuckGrassley @Vetpilot5k You could have typed that in a more concise way without the odd abbreviations.  I will gladly manage your social media and do all your proofing from now on.
Hey @realDonaldTrump I am worried about you if this guy given immunity knows all about your finances...does he know about that $100 bill you keep tucked in your sock? Feels like you are running low in funds maybe doubt tell him where your spare change jar is located just in case!
Thanks @LindseyGrahamSC for confirming you are a total sellout.  You’ve made our decision to run a better conservative that is not afraid of @realDonaldTrump very easy.  Go back to ignoring treason you will have lots of free time soon enough.

@FoxNews @realDonaldTrump Then we elected a @POTUS that is in love with dictators and is compromised by the Russians, now we don’t have to go to war we haven just surrendered to the regimes up front.

@naturedude7 I agree except I am kind of uncomfortable with you talk about ancestry.  Can you elaborate why you mention it and define what you mean?
@ThePangburn @DineshDSouza @Matt_Dillahunty I know for a fact @DineshDSouza only takes debates where he can come out looking like the victor.  I can dig up our contract where he came to a college campus when I helped bring him in.  Don’t waste your time and don’t validate a manipulative liar.
@naturedude7 @POTUS @DineshDSouza Classic tactic of the troll is to try to ridicule my faith and to intentionally take comments out of context. Christians are to stand for honestly and integrity and Trump is not that.  I pray for him every day to repent and that God move in spite of his outright sin.
@naturedude7 Can we discuss you saying nfl players spit on the grave of veterans?  I don’t place my hand over my heart because I don’t pledge allegiance to anything other than Jesus but love our country and adore our soldiers, do I spit on their graves too?
@naturedude7 It doesn’t seem like you want to discuss the content of  comments directly.  I do agree in your 1st amendment rights, and I think that the kneeling protest is unfortunately losing its meaning.  I hope they continue to bring attention to something bad,even if the method changes.
@naturedude7 What if they were kneeling in protests regarding the media saying @realDonaldTrump had a small inauguration crowd, and wanted to make it known they stood by @POTUS over the lame stream media lying about numbers and things.
@naturedude7 It offends you because you pay taxes?  It shouldn’t offend you anyone kneels for the anthem.  Are the 2% not allowed to protest an injustice because you don’t like it?
@murphtoday @fred_koerber @DineshDSouza You ever met @DineshDSouza ?  Of course you haven’t he’s under house arrest and you guys are in @GovernmentRF I’ve met him a number of times and dined with him in Durham NC.  He was a liar and a manipulator then and he’s worse now.
@fred_koerber @murphtoday @DineshDSouza Don’t be sad for me not troll person.  You might lose your bot troll job if you guys don’t get a more firm grasp on the leash of language.
@fred_koerber @DineshDSouza @GOP Never trumper and never any man with so many ties to the mob and Russian mobs that has sex with porn stars that’s is a pathological liar with the Russian army of bots and trolls defending him at every turn.
@naturedude7 That’s the strangest sentence structure I’ve ever seen.  You sure you’re not a foreign bot?
@fred_koerber @DineshDSouza Nope... biblical ultra conservative and I legit used to work for the @GOP you are wrong and silly to think all conservatives support liars like @DineshDSouza
@naturedude7 You cannot offend a game.  It offends racists.
@Ruthbarbetta @DineshDSouza Interesting to be that no @GovernmentRF trolls get the differences between they’re there and their along with your and you’re.  I’ve been calling on @Twitter to ban all those with bad grammar this just solidifies that need.
@jeromegay @ThabitiAnyabwil Agreed. Makes me sad to see the vitriol.  Praying that God was open up the eyes of people to see the root of their ignorance and hatred is fear and racism.
Who is @CRTV ?  Who funds you? How do you feel about what happened in Charlottesville last year?
@CRTV @Gavin_McInnes Nice to see this strange @CRTV just come right on out and support racist neo nazis by having them on your staff.
@edgarmomplaisir @badcomixbyanna @mattapodaca What do you have left if you’re all out of funny?  Angry? Sad? Ambivalent?  Did they copyright your funny for the show?
@naturedude7 They kneel to bring attention to police brutality disproportionately on black people.  I don’t watch either because watch people get brain damage is a sick way to spend your time.
@naturedude7 @POTUS @DineshDSouza Why do you have a twitter account followed by Scarramuchi but you’ve only tweeted like 50 times you @realDonaldTrump trolls are getting sophisticated
@naturedude7 @POTUS @DineshDSouza I didn’t know we could question salvation mr. bot.  Jesus will be at your judgement for sure bro but for you and @DineshDSouza I fear he will say to turn away because he never knew you.  Still time to repent and turn to Jesus and away from sinful heretics like Dinesh.
@naturedude7 @POTUS Nope said none of that.  It’s still “you’re” not your.  You cannot be a real christian person with the crazy stuff you just said you just want to muddy up the discourse like @DineshDSouza
@naturedude7 @POTUS Agreed he sees pornstars up close and Putin’s Butt..l many other politicians don’t see those
Hey @CoreyStewartVA you said you didn’t want to answer @ChrisCuomo because he is on the other side of the aisle so I ask from the @GOP side about your acceptance of racism and your alt-right tendencies.  Will you speak on your racism or will @VA_GOP look back bc of you?
@naturedude7 @DineshDSouza @GOP @realDonaldTrump You don’t strike me as a real person... that’s a weird thing to say about your business and employees and children and your government assistance.
Why does @Twitter ban @hamburgerphone but let Alex Jones remain?  @jamieloftusHELP is just trying to get noticed by some nice dorito loving magician by tweeting hilarious things.  The world of twitter is so confusing.
@naturedude7 @DineshDSouza @GOP @realDonaldTrump Ground rules also if we are debating what is a lie and what isn’t a lie would be an effort to find primary sources and to see what specific scholarly communities have come to a consensus on.  @DineshDSouza is no historian just a few years ago he was a bad debater for apologetics
@GParkinsonFarfa @DineshDSouza I love truth.  @DineshDSouza tells lies from the pits of hell and somehow has trumps russian army of bots and trolls protecting him its so weird you all defend such an amateur thief you should be defending big time crooks like @EricTrump

@naturedude7 @DineshDSouza @GOP Ground rules would be just fine... strictly what the Bible says and I am fine with being debates using original Greek and Hebrew... only fitting in the christological framework of Jesus being what the Bible is about not us not @GOP not USA not @realDonaldTrump but Christ the King
@Soren_Ltd @DOB_INC Between horny goat weed and @Arbys you’re probably fine by way of sponsors.
@naturedude7 @DineshDSouza @GOP The Bible teaches what you think is irrelevant that the is a central true outside of your opinion.  You are factually incorrect.
Metacritic really does a great job with the score assigned to #DeathofANation by con man and criminal and manipulator of Christian people @DineshDSouza .  Its the worst and most troubling movie I’ve seen in a long long time.	https://t.co/Npn8HX0BMo
@naturedude7 @DineshDSouza @GOP Interviewing a white supremacist is also troubling.  Additionally, i will write all mine out tomorrow if you will tell me how skewing history to match @DineshDSouza ‘s narrative is what Jesus would want him to do?  How can you reconcile this with faith?
@naturedude7 @DineshDSouza @GOP Referring to Lincoln’s Republican Party versus @GOP high school history teaches us of the basic flip of the parties in the 20th century.  Tying nazis to the democrat liberals.  I unfortunately watched this garbage movie and jotted down at least 60 factual inaccuracies.
@Kurt71755261 @milesofgray @Postmates @jamieloftusHELP @edgarmomplaisir Nah it wasn’t Edgar or Jamie I think it was billy Wayne Davis.  I had some beef with what @ShutUpAndrosky said the other week but @milesofgray explained it with one tweet and I more understood the guys point.  @DailyZeitgeist is still awesome!
@naturedude7 @DineshDSouza @GOP I violated the totality of the scriptures is that what you are trying to say in a weird way?  Last I checked called out heretics and liars like @DineshDSouza is something we are supposed to do.
@Kurt71755261 @milesofgray @Postmates @jamieloftusHELP @edgarmomplaisir I dont agree with everything billy Wayne Davis says either but for some reason he just strikes me as a reasonable person.  Maybe it’s the fact he talks like me haha.
@naturedude7 @DineshDSouza @GOP What scripture did I violate?  Are you a real account or a Russian troll?
@naturedude7 @DineshDSouza It’s “you’re” not “your”. I am a biblical inerrancy guy that is very biblically conservative.  It seems like the definition of conservative is defined by god differently than the @GOP each day.  God doesn’t change so you can infer who is changing. @DineshDSouza lies and deceives.
As a Christian man I am ashamed #DeathofaNationMovie is being seen by Christian people.  Its a total dumpster fire of a movie and it is not factual whatsoever.  @DineshDSouza is preying on people of faith to make money by fear mongering and peddling lies.
I find #DeathofaNationMovie movie to be one of the most nonsensical movies I’ve ever seen.  @DineshDSouza is a crook and additionally just seems completely ignorant of history.  You can just say “the real history of” and then make stuff up.

@jacquisneal @IfyNwadiwe @yayforzig I think if one of my heroes in MJ says anything at all... its more visceral than you think.  I would wager to think Trump was scared a psychopath like MJ would even make a short statement rebutting him.  I am scared right now MJ would see this tweet and punch me in the face.
@FoxNewsResearch How about specifically federal appeals judges?
@GOPChairwoman resist and obstruct  is the playbook of the @GOP you should be proud of the dems
@DailyZeitgeist @milesofgray @IfyNwadiwe @davetotheross Great show as always and @IfyNwadiwe is great.  Did @DammitCARL take @jack_obrien away when he stopped by last week?
@edgarmomplaisir @Skoty2Sticks I’m trying to get that Jamal Crawford style deal as well... if anyone knows a media company that needs corny jokes let me know.
Every time @IwriteOK has an episode of @bastardspod I get all my employees a bag of @Doritos .  The show reminds me that the best tasting treat AND the best way to prevent the worlds worst monsters from coming around is really one and the same.  Doritos!

@jacquisneal @edgarmomplaisir @culturekingspod I am going to be in LA in March doing some stuff with First Chinese Church and a few other churches over the course of like a week or so... if you have a kitche This mean old Baptist would love to cook for the @culturekingspod haha!
@edgarmomplaisir @jacquisneal @culturekingspod Some of the best fall of the bone ribs you will ever have.  I tried my wok skills out needs more work. Then homemade meatballs to go in homemade sauce for meatball subs or just spaghetti. This is why I’m sad y’all don’t invite me to the cookouts. https://t.co/SljD1LMmkU

@teacherfortrump @planet_steelers @Real_PeachyKeen @GenFlynn @BarbaraRedgate Are you a real account?  @Twitter loves having the bots around so i can’t report you to find out.  I don’t know that your point matters since its widely believed he conspired with Russians AND the Turkish and he’s working with the feds now.
@realDonaldTrump You are correct.  That poll is wrong.
I maybe have never laughed as hard as I did hearing @jacquisneal talk about the long process of getting comfortable on his bathroom floor.  The house that @DammitCARL built was a house of cards and has been rebuilt with smut. Ha!
@jamieloftusHELP I think pastoral ministry is where you’ve been called.  All other career attempts will result in bleeding gums and noses .
I think Mueller has @realDonaldTrump this time.  We see @DonaldJTrumpJr and Mueller have a secret meeting at an airport and @seanhannity and @FoxNews don’t even discuss it. @POTUS your son has flipped on you be careful!!!!
@culturekingspod @DammitCARL Where is @edgarmomplaisir ?  Does @milesofgray know about you letting him back into your office?  I missed you too @DammitCARL
@TwitterSupport why do you make it harder for me to report russian bots and trolls?  Seems like you would give me an easier option to report those that want to interrupt discourse.
@realDonaldTrump Good move to leak this information yourself so your real defense counsel @seanhannity can go ahead and brainwash all the baby boomers about this.  It’s a real stable genius move I didn’t know you had it in you.
@Real_PeachyKeen @teacherfortrump @GenFlynn @BarbaraRedgate Isn’t he cooperating with the special counsel?  Where is this money going to you are raising?
@katystoll Also seems like this is kind of bullying Cohen by taking away his leverage to cut a deal... I think the idea is that he won’t be valuable Mueller by taking this away from him.  It could backfire if Cohen gets to such a low place where he comes completely clean.
@katystoll I agree.  It makes no sense for Cohen to leak this stuff.  Seems like there is a calculated move from Trump... probably so his propaganda tv station @FoxNews can take care of his defense before it ever goes to court.
@benshapiro You are dumb.  Mueller is known on both sides to be a credible person. Do you know anything about history prior to 2016?
@jasoninthehouse @LouDobbs @FoxBusiness It looks like the ghost of @LouDobbs
@RepMarkMeadows why do you have to work so hard for information?  Because you and your colleagues are persons of interest in that investigation or similar investigations.  @NRA @GOP @GovernmentRF @jasoninthehouse @TGowdySC @NCGOP @RepDevinNunes
I would just keep this on the low @RepMarkMeadows once all the Russia stuff comes out and you are exposed for money laundering with @NCGOP it will look really bad you made this move. https://t.co/H6zJ4D19Te
@FoxNews @kayleighmcenany You guys say the craziest stuff.
@kilmeade @dallascowboys @foxandfriends I think you smile while your eyes cry for help.  I am sure @CNN would save you if you gave them a sign.
@harmks @PanamaforTrump @BretBaier @FoxNews @CNN Yes they would from the ignorant standpoint of @potus and #maga since @realDonaldTrump has a good friend that owns the inquirer.  Then he can control the news even more.
@blove65 @BretBaier @FoxNews @CNN Not a bot like @potus is not scared of @GovernmentRF
@JasonMillerinDC what makes it more difficult to sleep at night, knowing @GovernmentRF has some kind of dirt on you personally or knowing your lies mislead millions of Americans? I think it’s a trick question and you feel nothing.  Shame on you @CNN for letting him speak.
Thank you @POTUS I have been concerned such heroes of the twitter faith like myself and @DiamondandSilk would face further oppression from @Twitter .  No more shadow banning fake accounts otherwise @realDonaldTrump will lose millions of followers and he will throw a tantrum. https://t.co/JncFhN9mNC
Big shout out to my friends in @northcarolina and @VisitNC in not only having such gerrymandered districts it’s considered to be an affront to Democracy but now @RepMarkMeadows wants to be an affront on the National level by derailing investigations into @POTUS .Good job @NCGOP!

That’s where we can find common ground beyond our specific faith groups that we should all believe in human dignity and making all the sacrifices we can possibly make to help the people around us.  @jack_obrien it’s @FoxNews brainwashing baby boomers for real.
Flash forward ten years... his best friend/co-pastor/seminary professor writes regularly for @FoxNews and DailyCaller and he is silent on issues of helping out fellow man.  You know who wasn’t silent about helping others? Jesus.
There was a time a great pastor friend called on all churches in his home city to “adopt” one homeless family and provide them no strings attached with houses and bare necessities.  His church did this and I thought it was something to aspire to...
I was reminded today listening to @DailyZeitgeist how sad it is some of my personal friends in ministry willingly forget the call to push all in for anyone struggling around us.
@jacquisneal I hope no one sees a false dichotomy in an either/or and see you meant both/and. I believe in prayerful concern for those that are in bad times and lauding people that are doing great things so I completely agree you can do both.  Let your baptist friend take care of the haters.
@jasoninthehouse You don’t make much sense unless you are talking about a different government than ours.  You are compromised because of your sexual escapades and the fact you take money from Russian shell companies.
@DineshDSouza No need to assemble historians to critique your work of fiction.  If we put together a team of authors that write fiction, they still say your work sucks.  You are a no talent hack.
I can’t believe what @milesofgray and @jack_obrien said about Nickelback given that @edgarmomplaisir said he genuinely loves nickelback.  They were mocking your favorite music of all time.
If @edgarmomplaisir Won’t invite me to the howstuffworks west cookout I am going to invite @jamieloftusHELP to cohost my next party. If @jack_obrien doesn’t invite me I will tweet at him from Colangelo’s burner accounts. https://t.co/lR7SpqviEd

Hey @DailyZeitgeist I Have been mattress shopping for a while and gonna give this purple mattress a shot.  If I don’t like it I am moving in with @jack_obrien .
I hope that @PreetBharara didn’t respond to @realDonaldTrump texts after giving out his cell number bad was like “what’s up with the green bubble sms Donald?  No way POTUS doesn’t have an interesting joke”
@GovMikeHuckabee @realDonaldTrump Remember that time you said the N word to Adrian Rogers when we were at dinner?  I do.  @SBCCP should probably take your fear mongering into account and distance themselves from you.
@GovMikeHuckabee @realDonaldTrump Have you been drinking again?
@SenThomTillis @McFaul If you believe what you say stand up for your state and your country and stand against @realDonaldTrump .  Too bad you and @NCGOP and @GOP launder money as well.
@broberts1958 @seanhannity It’s more than 63 million dude.  It’s all you racists in America AND @GovernmentRF AND the other dictators or our world.
How do you sleep at night @kilmeade ?  Do you just pray that being a pathological liar is ok in the eyes of god?
@realDonaldTrump What are you talking about?  Drug companies don’t have a specific day they increase prices.
@TToQEsther @PreacherMiller @Fred_Butler I googled it nothing comes up but the feeling you are insane.  Links?
I have a conspiracy theorists view of this situation now and think @GovernmentRF has some tapes of @jasoninthehouse @TGowdySC and others.
Today’s great episode is why @DailyZeitgeist is my favorite podcast.  @jack_obrien @milesofgray did a great job revisiting yesterday’s conversation being respectful about their guest yesterday and pushing forward with discussions.

@ShutUpAndrosky Weren’t you involved with or currently involved with @DSA_LosAngeles ?  I get it that the group claims to be non political but democratic socialism is a political ideology right?  I think it’s worth digging in our heels to try to impact politics nationally and locally.
@DJJenkins I do a variation of the same thing... I tell myself I am a good preacher and my mom thinks I’m a great preacher so it must be true.
RT @milesofgray: Deebo = Putin	Red = Trump 	Please share with anyone that doesn't understand what happened yesterday https://t.co/Gw8PP1oxHv
@milesofgray @DailyZeitgeist Thanks for clarifying and being so diplomatic @milesofgray .  You would have been a worthy opponent when you worked for Harry Aries and I worked for the tea party express.
@milesofgray @DailyZeitgeist I can totally agree with that aspect and I hope @ShutUpAndrosky would accept my apology if I came off as too harsh.  I still think the answer is more involvement than ever... whether it’s his movement or other movements.  We need more than these two parties.
@ginnybeesly @jack_obrien @KanyeWestquire @milesofgray @DailyZeitgeist @ShutUpAndrosky I think it hurts everyone to throw up our hands and say it doesn’t matter nothing we can do about it when we are on the cusp of one of the most important midterm elections in our lifetimes.... just ask @crookedmedia how important it is they say it every five minutes.  Ha!
You presented a false dichotomy where you insist we compartmentalize in an either/or when it’s really both Russia AND those other issues are terrible Russia right now poses the greatest risk.  Sorry @DailyZeitgeist that ignorance on a big day I think is worthy of correction.
I usually just say nice things to folks but I really didn’t appreciate how you minimized the whole thing by saying it will literally impact us in no way, then saying the saudis did 9/11 and then doing some whataboutism.  The stuff you mentioned is bad too.
Also Russia is out number one adversary because they are are a cyberwar with us right now, and they actively want to annex other countries so they can be the worlds superpower.  They also have lots of nukes.
They did calculate some number of individuals that viewed Russian propaganda to sow division and make one party look bad... and it’s like 100	Million or something. Don’t need to back machines if you’ve hacked the minds of the downtrodden.
I would disagree and maybe and with all due respect, this @ShutUpAndrosky should actually get informed on the issues he said he doesn’t pay attention to before he makes such broad sweeping generalizations.
@DailyZeitgeist what’s up with your guest @ShutUpAndrosky saying Russia stuff has no impact on our day to day lives?  @jack_obrien and @milesofgray would you concur that the things that went down today are insignificant to our normal lives?
It’s time for @SpeakerRyan @marcorubio and others to attempt to salvage their legacy and do the Barry Goldwater Walk up to the @WhiteHouse to lay out what’s best for our nation to @realDonaldTrump .  Do the right thing.
I am at a loss of jokes and seeing the bright side of the events of today regarding @realDonaldTrump .  I am relying on @DailyZeitgeist @jack_obrien @milesofgray @annahossnieh to make me feel better when I listen shortly.
@GovMikeHuckabee @realDonaldTrump You took money from @GovernmentRF too.  And you’ve been laundering money for @GOP for years.  Too bad @SBCCP won’t distance themselves from you.
Can @DailyZeitgeist confirm whether or not @realDonaldTrump was spanked with a rolled up magazine by Putin during his meeting today?
Great job!
So I’ve seen the whole spectrum probably as well.  Very interesting to see the business behind it, and I hope those like me that help guide church planting listen with an open mind to see your insights and to maybe be convicted that our models really look like secular companies.
Hey @Gimletmedia I have found your church planting podcast really interesting so far. I’ve helped with church plants from Toronto to L.A., and I’ve pastor new churches and old ones, and a member of a church plant that was a great and a church plant that could be crooked.
I think @TGowdySC seems fairly drunk at times and then when it comes time to vote to force an fbi to divulge classified information for a sham congressional trial he sobers up and decides to pass.   Good move scarecrow but Batman can still link you to @GovernmentRF @GOP
I think @TGowdySC has laundered his money from @GovernmentRF through the disguise of a hair stylist.  We need to see how much he reports to paying for his hair, it’s probably in the millions.
@Mikebattuello @johnwhitehead81 @TGowdySC Also want to check in on how much money he took from @GovernmentRF and about his affairs and drinking problems.  @TGowdySC come on man let’s lay the damn texts on the table dammit hell damn hell.  So provocative you are with your potty mouth.

So did you ever date a 6 foot 6 white dude that is pale as a corpse that carries a huge pencil on his back as a prop for his act? He seemed like he’s 65 years old at the very least.  If he’s your ex let me know I will tack him down for you. Ha!
Hey @jamieloftusHELP I went downtown in the city I live in tonight and there was this weird clown sharing some kind of propaganda... I talked to him and go seem cool he said he played drums.  I then asked him if he ever dated Jamie Loftus.  He was silent and walked away.
@infowars You guys are so good at making money from vitamins while stoking the fires of racism and lies and conspiracies.  Maybe @RealAlexJones perjured himself in court and he isn’t playing a character.
@infowars “Washington D.C. is not the proper venue for plaintiffs’ suit,” Huvelle wrote. “It bears emphasizing that this Court’s ruling is not based on a finding that there was no collusion between defendants and Russia during the 2016 presidential election.”
Here’s my Scott Pruitt theory since @jamieloftusHELP beat me to marker theft.  Scott was at a meeting and decided to use a Fork and knife to eat his snickers bar.  Trump was confused and fired him.  That or his used mattress in his office smelled like pee pee. @DailyZeitgeist
hey @BillSimmons please don't fire @larrywilmore for the things he said about @celtics coach Brad Stevens.  Just have him on your podcast so he can tell you to your face how he feels.
Way to keep your company classy @RepMarkMeadows you gonna be as hard on @jim_jordan or act like it’s liberal fake news?
@Jim_Jordan why are YOU keeping secrets ?  Don’t worry just be open with ignoring molestation @GOP won’t do anything.  You insulting the @FBI to cover for @realDonaldTrump is more important.  Just be honest about your complicity in sex crimes.
@IfyNwadiwe Your friends are stuck up snobs.
@ringer @dannychau I suspect there is international collusion taking place with this deal.  I really didn’t expect this at all.
Hey @jack_obrien you gotta get @milesofgray @edgarmomplaisir @annahossnieh @jacquisneal @jamieloftusHELP together ASAP have an emergency podcast to discuss this Cousins to Warriors trade.  There is collusion happening and we need a special counsel investigation.
Hey @SheriffClarke the @MichaelCohen212 thing is a big deal because he can’t flip on anyone by @realDonaldTrump .  Sorry you’re sad that you’re irrelevant.  Hope you get the attention you crave so much.
@SallieSaxon Like when you work with @NCGOP to launder money?  Or when you overlook the incredibly sinful behavior of @POTUS ?  Do the ends justify the means sometimes?
@IfyNwadiwe I only halfway changed my tune about Lebron when going to my favorite team... until 20 minutes ago when I saw the Boogie to @warriors trade. Now I want to see Lebron crush them.
@jacquisneal This caught me out of nowhere I can’t fathom why boogie would sign for such a small contract.  I was a Lebron hater until about 15 minutes ago when I found out about this trade to @warriors now I want to see him crush them.
Hey @BillSimmons how did this happen? You should call into @jack_obrien podcast @DailyZeitgeist to discuss.  I just to put teams together like this on NBA Live ‘95 on snes.  #boogie #NBASummer https://t.co/nefZitnksO
@GOP And they were right then it if everyone played fair it would be the right thing to do now.  However given gerrymandering and @GovernmentRF backing @GOP efforts I say do what you gotta do.  None of you in gop know Jesus.
@GOP Doesn’t that mean you’ve flip flopped too?
Hey @edgarmomplaisir I am glad you are hooked on @sprite and not @MelloYello like I am.  Your fast metabolism can’t beat Mello Yello.  Sprite should notice your love or their product and sign you as their ambassador.

Last time tweeting at @culturekingspod but it’s definitely a lot of my white friends like to get nasty with folks at restaurants.  I don’t like onions, if I get onions I wipe them off or politely ask it to be fixed... I get free food all the time.  Others get triggered.
@jamieloftusHELP How did it feel?
P.S.  I left a staunch church to go to a multicultural church and I couldn’t understand why they would be so upset if I would start on time. I met my wife at this church.  We eat 6pm dinner at 9pm.  I have to tell her the show is at 5 if we need to make it by 7.
I think @culturekingspod should get their version of friends on tv.  If they do I would like to be the random white neighbor that can pop in like Kramer or that dude that lived in a van on TGIF classic Step by Step.  Oh wait y’all too young for step by step.

Hey @DailyZeitgeist @annahossnieh @jack_obrien @jamieloftusHELP I hereby demand you revisit the topic of this “BDE” with @milesofgray .  The world deserves to hear his take of this energy.
@jasoninthehouse @RepMarkMeadows @Jim_Jordan You guys should all just turn yourselves in for your money laundering with @GOP @NRA and @GovernmentRF .  Your drunken profane speeches and posturing are silly and counter productive.  Sober up @TGowdySC you look like a Batman villian that needs drug rehab.
Hey @jamieloftusHELP I agree with you that I Frankenstein it way better than Godfather.  Never seen The Godfather but I’ve seen enough to know it’s good, but I, Frankenstein is great!  Great show today @DailyZeitgeist !
I wonder why even @maddow won’t address the notion that @GOP could be all antsy over justice department probes... because in addition to @realDonaldTrump lots of other guys like @TGowdySC @RepDevinNunes @jasoninthehouse have engaged in the same crimes with #russia
@PreetBharara Its the typical midseason snooze fest... rehashing old ideas.  Since our president is a reality TV expert I have no doubt there will be new episodes and an expanded universe of characters soon.
Hey @TGowdySC I usually appreciate a potty mouth but you seemed like you were drunk when you were shouting at @FBI .  Another way justice can be done?  The guilty can confess to their crimes.  You can pave the way and confess your ties to @GovernmentRF before it leaks...
@freedom7930 @oliverdarcy @Cernovich @VinceMcMahon @realDonaldTrump Everyone with the form of dementia @realDonaldTrump has goes back to the same few lines regardless of how they get there... he might say crazy stuff to get there but he’s certainly stuck in greatest hits mode and doesn’t seem able to get out.
@AliBakirdan @Cernovich 56,000 retweets?  No way you’re a real person.
@novatoking Relative equal number friends that says the same dumb things dozens of others say?  Yep you are a Russian bot I wish @TwitterSupport was bold enough to shut you down.  If for nothing else so @GovernmentRF can expand your responses.
Hey @Cernovich I feel like you know this but thought I would just tell you that you have thousands of Russian bots cycling through everything you post.  I am sure it helps you sell herbal redemedies so I tell you that to say this, you’re not very popular with actual humans.
@oliverdarcy @Cernovich Well why would they change their normal program?  To hear the same racist speech again?  He will brag about his victory and say deep state then some racists stuff it’s very formulaic.  @VinceMcMahon taught @realDonaldTrump well.
@Cernovich You’re still absolutely out of your mind.  Or you are an insane genius taking advantage of people’s basic fears.  Either way you are a psychopath I think.
@zamster201 @Cernovich No.  Not at all.
Hey @realDonaldTrump you should tell each member of your family and circle of advisors a different Supreme Court  nominee name so you can root out the leaker who thinks you’re doing competent.  Spoiler alert:  it’s all of them.
@Cernovich You are a straight up weirdo.  You should take an extra dose of that stuff that compels you to be a racist fear mongering liar and get back to selling skin care stuff bro.
@NDCTrump @TwitterSupport should take this down.  It’s inciting violence
@TrueFactsStated He thrives by leeching off the souls of young ambitious politicians.  He and @GOP feed off of their desire to do right until they are empty husks like @SpeakerRyan .  Then you throw them away and sustain your evil life with more souls.  It’s the only thing that makes sense.
@kenfryer @realDonaldTrump @drmoore Do the ends justify the means?  Biblically speaking is it ok to lie and cover up sin if the end result is something good? @tomascol you are a theological juggernaut you tell me how it’s ok?  Pres not pastor?  Give me your lamest reason.
You know what would be the greatest twist on a reality tv show ever? If @realDonaldTrump nominates @PreetBharara to be on on the Supreme Court.  Probably going to be more akin to @JudgeJeanine than Preet though.  #AnthonyKennedy was the last moderate standing.
@GovMikeHuckabee @EveningEdit @FoxBusiness @realDonaldTrump You are a terrible human being and so is @PressSec but I am sure you will be of higher intelligence and character than whatever buffoon @realDonaldTrump picks.  Maybe it will be a curveball and be @PreetBharara and we will be pleasantly surprised.
@tomascol I feel like Michael Servetus should play a role in exactly how silly and slightly racist this pontification sounds.  I think you’re a great theologian but this issue with MLK seems borne out of something other than your concern about for protecting women.
@BradHambrick It also worked very well for Cyrano de Bergerac I think...

Hey @Soren_Ltd your hot take was spot on... @Arbys has some delicious fresh market sandwiches!  Hopefully they will get up with @jack_obrien and @DailyZeitgeist and make them believers .  Then @milesofgray comes back to tons of Arby’s banners around his office...
@thatlunarredkid @msdanifernandez I think it could be worse than that.  I know from my interactions with @GovMikeHuckabee and folks like him is that that are just emotionally unmoved when they lie or mislead.  I think they just like money and power and I think they’ve become their own gods.
Great job on @DailyZeitgeist today!!
My faith seems to have a warning given to church leaders that sell out to the world... God does not approve at all of leveraging your position to brainwash people for @GOP .  I pray in a year I can tweet a little differently and be less ashamed of my circle of sbc pastors.
Can’t understand how we can take up for @realDonaldTrump or separating children from family.  Worked my whole adult life toward a new dawn Baptists, and in one fell swoop everyone gets on with @realDonaldTrump and we bring his tactics back into our convention work.
.@msdanifernandez as a real southern baptist pastor, I have been deeply grieved by other so called men of faith saying insanely incomprehensible things.  Things that are contrary to the Bible.

Hey @jack_obrien taking our two and a half year old on a long trip.... what movie did you say your kid loved on your trip? My kid has already heard every episode of @DailyZeitgeist or we wouldn’t have any issues.

Hey @GovMikeHuckabee remember that time you me and @_PPatterson_ were having dinner and you thought it was hilarious Paige used the N word?  I do.
@GovMikeHuckabee I am ashamed to say this racist used to be a Southern Baptist pastor. @SBCCP should be proud.  OR his pastor friends should condemn this racism.  How about it @jdgreear or @BruceAshford either of you want to speak on this or reach out to Huckabee about it?
Hey @RedHenLex good move on not serving pathological liars.  I suspect you will be accused of being MS13 though.   No chance @GovMikeHuckabee or @PressSec pay their bill or tip well.
@PressSec @POTUS I would be worried you wouldn’t pay your bill.  Since you are a pathological liar and you work for the most broke president @realDonaldTrump since Truman, I would share the same concern... you would skip out on the check then blame the Mexicans or say only the dems can fix it.

Hey @milesofgray @jack_obrien have you guys covered Scott Pruitt’s tactical pants?  	https://t.co/hCjcNh7Hyz
@roebuck_jim @_Matt_Carter @bartbarber @jdgreear @drmoore I stand corrected.  You are no pre-programmed bot.  You are a genuine tried and true Southern Baptist Troll.  :)
@_Matt_Carter @roebuck_jim @bartbarber @jdgreear @drmoore Man, it is surreal.  It was really seriously intriguing to me.  I had to get back to being a real world person and real life pastor after a while though.
@_Matt_Carter @roebuck_jim @bartbarber @jdgreear @drmoore They are designed to hone in on certain hash tags and conversations and really to just disrupt genuine dialogue.  Like, politics aside, scroll through @realDonaldTrump replies and retweets and most of them are not real accounts. They generate fake hype and spread inaccuracies.

@_Matt_Carter @roebuck_jim @bartbarber @jdgreear @drmoore Bots are what weirded me out the most... they are computer programmed responses, but there was once about a year ago I thought the conversation was disjointed but with a human, figured out it was well designed set of computerized responses though.  Will find a link to send you.
@_Matt_Carter @roebuck_jim @bartbarber @jdgreear @drmoore That’s how I ended up keeping this weird parody account... I was interested in bots and trolls and how they operate after some of my posts got hijacked by crazy talk.  Makes me question who’s real on Twitter.  Maybe I am the real Billy Sunday and you are fake @_Matt_Carter :)
@roebuck_jim @_Matt_Carter @bartbarber @jdgreear @drmoore I don’t believe @roebuck_jim is a real account.  Most of his tweets are trump retweets.  Take it from this fake account.  Mr. Roebuck is no real account.
@roebuck_jim @bartbarber @jdgreear @drmoore You frame sbc life in the exact way we should not allow it to be... like it is just an arm of @GOP and that current leadership isn’t political enough or the right way.  SBC president won’t be the “front man” for the leader of ERLC it’s not a political conspiracy plot.
Hey @CLewandowski_ classy move in mocking kids with disabilities just like your boss.  I think even @GovernmentRF is disappointed in this.  You know who isn’t disappointed?  @GOP #gop if they cared they would distance themselves from you.
@GovMikeHuckabee He figured since you bend over to @FoxNews and @GovernmentRF you are the cheapest date in town.
@GovMikeHuckabee You think it’s a good start because you’ve been accepting bribes and facilitating money laundering since you were a pastor in @Arkansasgov you should be ashamed of yourself you godless man

@GOP Presidential porn Star mistresses, Russian money flowing through @NRA @NRATV , separating children from parents, constantly getting more and nationalistic, lots of affairs, money laundering.  Seems like you guys have some crooked candidates too.
@bartbarber @GuideStone When I was in seminary prior to being married I worked a full time job to continue serving a smaller church though I had some chances to go to a bigger place more money.  It was a blessing and @bartbarber has a great idea!
@realDonaldTrump Resign and go peacefully to prison so you can think about the high crime of human rights atrocities for the rest of your days.  @GOP needs to dissolve they are puppets of @FoxNews time for a new Conservative party right now.
.@SecNielsen I think Congress can take steps toward fixing this incredibly atrocity you are facilitating.  Impeach @realDonaldTrump @SpeakerRyan any @GOP that won’t speak up and any @dnc member that won’t fight without ceasing.
praying @RepMarkMeadows and @RepDavidRouzer respond quickly to end separating children from parents at the boarder, My friends in nc sent some statutes to look over and they won’t have to wait to vote you out they can impeach you out of office.  You are heartless and godless
Hey @msdanifernandez I will go back to bad jokes later today, but you did the right thing with the dude at the gym.  His “apology” makes me cringe since he gives reasons its ok and how he is a victim.  The world has gone nuts to think this is remotely ok.
@DOB_INC @msdanifernandez Hey @DOB_INC parody account aside... I am glad you said what you said.  @Rian_Lee5677 failed so bad trying to be snarky and just came off as menacing and threatening.

@FurtickThe He used to have followers like you but they got old.  And really you can only cover up for so much junk over the decades and at some point people have to at least distance themselves.  Be careful fake furtick being a cult leader is tough.
@Coach_Jones89 I don’t know @bartbarber but he’s a man I look up to from afar now.  Obviously not easy decisions, obviously painful process, and agree or disagree we should appreciate his willingness to go through it all.
@Coach_Jones89 You just tell @bartbarber to drop some names... i went thorough that when I was on a special study committee after our report... and I was grieved total strangers had such vitriol.
I was disappointed @bartbarber didn’t say “haters gonna hate” and mic drop, but  God gave you the right words for the right time in the right place.  My confirmation is that even @Wade_Burleson approves.  Unity within the spectrum of orthodoxy is very encouraging. #SBCAM18 #SBC18
RT @pastorclint: I love America. I like Mike Pence. I hate this.
@Wade_Burleson Last time I preached Matthew 23, two retired pastors told me I was picking on them and proceeded to torture my family and I until I resigned.  Funny/sad part, I didn’t preach anything that day.  I only read the text out loud and planned on preaching it the next week.
@realDonaldTrump It doesn’t feel like you think it’s funny.  Maybe we should get you Tiny remote so your tiny hands can turn the channel.
@Wade_Burleson as a pastor/bishop/elder/ceo/parody/superhero i decided enough was enough at #sbcam18 and I got on the phone called SBC megachurch # and said look Convention that motion is dumb you should have thrown it out yesterday.  Now it’s your turn.  Boycott Pence.
@Lnbehan Good morning!  Are you and yours at the convention? Would love to meet you guys!  Why does it matter how the corporate world treats people? Shouldn’t we hold pastors to a higher standard and by proxy a steeper consequence when moral failure occurs?

@Wade_Burleson @dj_reynolds I wish this motion would be rejected based on common sense.  I haven’t presided over a large gathering like that in a long long time, but I say let it get thrown out and if people want to be upset.... ask for a clearer report from @swbts within an appropriate timeframe.
@TwitEvangelical @baptistpress Looks like trolls and seldom used burner accounts belonging to racist trolls are being used today.  Look be a man stop hiding behind a fake account and just proudly proclaim your racism.  It’s childish to use a parody account anyway you all need to grow up
@jgreer52 @baptistpress I don’t know where it was then, but I am glad it’s here now.  My home church leadership bullied taunted ridiculed an African American family that firmly believed they were called to that congregation.  It made me sick and I have refused to preach there again.
@PastorTim68 @baptistpress It’s strange this is one of your ten total tweets ever @pastortim68. Do you believe god is in favor of racism? I await your neo Nazi deflection and whataboutism nonsense response.  #sbcam2018 did the right thing
@travismaclay @_jdgreear_ @jdgreear I dunno man.  Just because a brand new account blocks you it doesn’t mean it’s a fake account.  :).

Hey @milesofgray don’t be worried about the North Korea summit.  Rodman is there.  Don’t you remember he averaged liked 14 rebounds a game?  He also hit three consecutive three pointers one game and won everyone at the United center a free taco.  So, no worries.
@JasonMillerinDC Aren’t you under investigation for your role in being an agent of @GovernmentRF and didn’t they komprimant you by outing your affair?
@LouiseMensch @DLoesch I’ve been trying to get @DLoesch to block me for like a year.  I am jealous you are always three steps ahead of me.
@mflynnJR Shame on you for this @GenFlyn @realDonaldTrump this is too far even for you people.
@jasoninthehouse I agree with you this time @jasoninthehouse they need to pander to their base.  Not expand out to these foods foreign to the core of IHOP’s very nature.  They need some coaching bro and you are free right?  Go help make America great again by making bacon and pancakes great.
I would like to nominate @FakeJDGreear as president at @SBCMeeting #SBC2018 .
I see @IfyNwadiwe chose not to respond to my tweet.  Friends, he’s guilty.  Lock him up or whatever you comedians do when your hilarious friends play hilarious pranks on you.
@RealAlexJones You fear monger to make money.  I refuse to follow a fake psychopath like you.  I need a truly insane person to follow not just a liar pushing supplements. Also, you’re wrong about Waco
@edgarmomplaisir @IfyNwadiwe Listen to him taper off when he says “nah what are you talking about”. Just ask @jack_obrien about some micro expressions he can settle it he knows all about nuanced pseudo psychology I bet.
@edgarmomplaisir @IfyNwadiwe Yeah if I could have I am thinking your face muscles would have screamed out “I definitely spent 24 hours trolling @edgarmomplaisir and @jacquisneal “. I get it bro it’s cool I have a two year old sometimes I get bored as well.
@Docjonas @Wade_Burleson I hold tight to that God can bend our errors to his glory so I hope the CBF does well, but I’ve always held out hope that on there would be a moment where we could say we are all Christians going forward even if we operate under different denominations.  Sounds crazy huh?
@Docjonas @Wade_Burleson It’s crazy.  I call myself a moderate now, but guys like @_PPatterson_ have looked me squarely in the eye and said I am a “flamin’ liberal” and said if I didn’t go along I could get out and would be labeled in such a way I would never pastor an sbc church again.
Hey @IfyNwadiwe , you sure you weren’t the dude trolling @edgarmomplaisir ?  I am mentalist status with micro expressions and whatnot and you are great but didn’t convince me you weren’t the troll.  I wish Edgar would post some screen shots I am nosy. Ha!
@Docjonas @brooklynrose06 @Wade_Burleson I can agree with that statement.  Isn’t it sad how moderate has such a bad name these days?  Working in cooperation to find compromises with the broad spectrum of orthodoxy to be missional was always the goal, and somehow the extremists on both sides are always on display.
@brooklynrose06 @Docjonas @Wade_Burleson It’s an organization that started in the early 1990s in splitting with the SBC.  I have some dear friends that went to the CBF.  Though we would recount the same story @Docjonas and I would probably give different spins of the same history.  Truth is probably in the middle.
@Docjonas @Wade_Burleson I am one of the guys that calls it the Conservative Resurgence, and I am appreciative of much of its overflow but @Docjonas I still agree with your statement.  We reap what we sow and we didn’t handle things with dignity then and we’ve let many of these guys go unchecked since.
I hope that at #SBC18 that the issues at hand don’t go quietly into the night, and I hope that @bellevuepastor @jdgreear or @KenHemphill would be bold enough to speak boldly and Biblically.  Too bad @_PPatterson_ put you all in your positions so none of you will speak up.
@Wade_Burleson This is all so sad. I have trouble understanding why issues that should be clear cut get all caught up like we are Republicans vs. Democrats.  I guess the discourse in the church has been corrupted just as much as everywhere else.
I hope #SBC18 remembers every single pastor that has taken up for bullies and for men that cover up rape. @pastorbobhadley I pray men like you come to their senses and stop covering up for guys that helped you along the way like @_PPatterson_
@sammoore1958 Look it comes down to this false dichotomy:  are we going to stand with Lottie moon or the devil?  Will we stand with lord and savior @_PPatterson_ or will we just worship Satan instead?  Boil things down to simple choices and you miss the complexity of every issue.   Simpleton.
@sammoore1958 I don’t think you are being truthful whatsoever but if we are using false dichotomies here’s mine: old racist men scared of becoming irrelevant?  Or Theologically grounded leaders of the next generation that aren’t baby boomers.
@ANDREAREADSBOOK @tedcruz @Marriott @jimmykimmel @EPAScottPruitt See if you can just sneak out of @Marriott with the mattress.  Pruitt seems down on his luck best to get him a used hotel mattress for free.  Just make sure he doesn’t take the black light to it.
@APVBible And one day we will reach those unreached people groups and all of humanity will know what you’re talking about.  Too bad they don’t live near resources like oil or good crops. If they did we would offer up that sweet deal, our religion for all your land.
@APVBible True story, one time @robertjeffress sent me a DM and I thought he had figured out who I am or was mad I asked him about his racism and whatnot.  He asked me to donate to his ministry. I say that to say this... leave him alone he’s just a poor preacher living paycheck to paycheck
@APVBible Amen.  Hopefully you can teach A breakout session at #sbc2018.  Punching down at our critics beneath us is way easier than punching up.  And think about it, at this point in my life I am so much better than everyone if I punch up I’m just trying to hit the moon.	 Or God.
@APVBible Jesus would have given the 5,000 diabetes had he baked cakes,  you can’t say no to another piece if the Lord himself miraculously had another slice for you.
@APVBible I think you are missing the point.  Baking cakes is a woman’s job and that dude threw down this smoke bomb to keep us from seeing the real issue at hand, men in the kitchen. I think when he was caught doing women’s work, he was ashamed and had to something to deflect.
@APVBible In my experience the best way for me to make genuine friends of different backgrounds is to specifically target them so I eventually have stories to tell about how I saved people.	 The ol’ lets be friends trick will get them every time.
@APVBible Amen bro.  Raising kids sucks.  I like to get home after a hard day or twisting to scriptures to fit my own personal agenda and just relax, not deal with some little kid saying “daddy this is what I did today”.  No one cares what you did unless it was help mama fix supper.
@APVBible @PreacherMiller Hey @APVBible I believe we could be soulmates and that God, through @PreacherMiller here has brought us together.  Will you be my Twitter bff?  We can troll together maybe have some courtship and maybe preacher Miller will conduct our online marriage.
@PreacherMiller I hope that @PreacherMiller sees the cost of making ignorant statements on social media for all the world to see.  It damages your witness and causes trolls on both sides to make sure you know how insightful you’re not.
@PreacherMiller @disciple4life His lunch pail has a lot of stolen documents in it if it’s that heavy.  Maybe the crushing weight of being a bully and trying to intimidate victims that fell into his lunch box, it certainly missed his soul. Your statement isn’t funny you should work on your comedy.
@richardpiles Don’t be so down on yourself.  I believe pastors are setting the world of social media ablaze with their shaky cell phone videos letting everyone know they are traveling to do Baptist stuff.  I am very interested to know you’re going and will lend my shaky hand to hold the camera
@KenHemphill @disciple4life I wonder if @KenHemphill wild be a man of his word and sow unity not division?  Would you delete this tweet in effort to bridge the generational divide in the sbc?  I don’t think you will, but just though I would ask.
@HeathTibbetts @KenHemphill I am greatly offended that @KenHemphill allows these generational divides to develop and that he is feeding into it.  @HeathTibbetts i think your folksy opinon and conclusion where you conclude our older generation is the measuring stick is idolatrous.
@fisherknights @KenHemphill Young man you need to learn how to give the right way.  Give to your association that is absolutely failing because decades ago they served a purpose and a lot of old people like to remember the good old days.  THAT is the cause to give toward.
@KenHemphill @disciple4life Where did these that’s come from @KenHemphill ?  I believe that many in your age range give @FoxNews style information... I like to call it misinformation.
@sammoore1958 I think there could be less than one paid prophet in the sbc as well.  You mad about that too?  Time to make a change at #sbc2018 and make an motion to study why we have so few prophets.  Maybe @edstetzer has some stats on this?
@Jamiec1214 @DannyAkin I agree.  @_PPatterson_ should have been fired long ago for his bully tactics and maybe should be arrested for his hand in covering up assault crimes.  Glad we are on the same page on this Patterson thing.
@tyler_pearce @revblakehdodd @DannyAkin You win the internets.
@revblakehdodd @DannyAkin you ever read the Shakespeare work you are quoting from?  Are you aware you are giving a menacing death threat?  Also, if you’re going to deliver a veiled metaphorical threat, you really need to step up your proof reading game.  Prof @DannyAkin would mark you down for that :)
@sammoore1958 @DannyAkin It was the mighty hand of God that placed @DannyAkin at @SEBTS .
@MartyJacumin @pastorjeff899 @DannyAkin Amen.  @DannyAkin is a great man of god!

@SharayahColter @johnnymhunt where do @edstetzer @BruceAshford @jdgreear @FakeJDGreear @albertmohler @fredluterjr @RickWarren stand on circulating these documents?  I don't know either none of them are man enough to condemn(or praise) what you're doing.  This silence is how we got where we are. #SBC2018
@SharayahColter @johnnymhunt regardless of who shares what, the fact remains you and your husband are sharing stolen documents to bully victims of sexual assault and I concede you win.  Because @SBCCP @swbts @SEBTS @bellevuepastor sit back and let it go on.
@disciple4life @johnnymhunt @_PPatterson_ I can't speak for everyone, but the people I find guilty are the ones like @ScottColter who are bullying possible victims.  I would have not gotten involved and made specific plans to be more involved than I have been in years at #SBC2018 had it not been for this bullying.
@johnnymhunt @micahfries @_PPatterson_ I hope you mean this, because my prayer is that Jesus be honored, and that we stand for the lesser of these, in this case the sexually abused, while finding a balance to let the facts go where the facts go, so the truth can come out one way or another.
@Lnbehan for the record though, I've seen God do some awe inspiring things all over the world, but I didn't do any of it.  He worked through me sometimes and in spite me of other times.  Please allow me to retract and apologize in regards to your giving.  That was not appropriate to ask.
@Lnbehan in this matter I can say confidently... @_PPatterson_ and I are on equal footing with building.  God uses who he wants to use, whether it be me or @_PPatterson_ or @Wade_Burleson or @fbcjaxwatchdog or @erguncaner or @tomascol .  Its by his power we can do anything.
@Lnbehan I really respect your decision to look into these matters.  I am here if you want to talk anymore... either publicly on here or private in a DM.  blessings to you and praying we place more faith in Jesus than anyone else.  Thank you for your lengthy dialogue with me as well.

@SBCexplainer @DavidEHankins @KenHemphill He didn't answer you so I will.  Yes @DavidEHankins is being openly dishonest again.  And yes, @LaBaptists continue to let him get away with it... for now.
@drdennislong @DavidEHankins @KenHemphill Always trust your gut @drdennislong .  Don't worry about facts or being a first hand witness or even remembering where you heard the story.  Just weave what you want to believe in your mind and use your influence to spread that around.
@DavidEHankins You kind of make it sound like you don't much like one of them.  I am excited for the @LaBaptists gathering this year as well, hopefully we can find a suitable executive director.
@DavidEHankins I also wonder if @kablume would care to respond to your assessment? I bet he won't, you know why?  He's classy, dignified and always takes the high road.  I am sad you feel the need to critique the work of a man that isn't going to rebuke or rebut you for it.
@DavidEHankins I get very frustrated when guys with your stature bend the truth or explain away possible lies like "someone told me and I understand whatever"... that's saying YOU don't know the conversation that took place either.
@DavidEHankins I went to @jdgreear one time and asked him if his time helping state convention boards was worth it as I was reconsidering some things I agreed to.  He said absolutely and he bragged on our State Director and encouraged me to stay involved.
@AndoranGambler @DailyZeitgeist @jamieloftusHELP Agreed.  @milesofgray and @jack_obrien really do have a first rate podcast and I hope one day they name names who called @DailyZeitgeist second rate so me and Colangelo can mean tweet them.
Hey @Lnbehan another question.  How much money have you donated to @_PPatterson_ or his wife and their initiatives? Can you give an estimation?
@Lnbehan You were responding quickly until I’ve asked this direct question.  Have you seen first hand that the only documents he had were these letters?
@Lnbehan I just looked you guys up... you all should be very familiar with how the justice system works.  I will pass on speaking with you at this time.  I use a parody account to hide from a relative with a mental illness, so I won’t type out my info publicly.  Send me a DM we can talk.
@Lnbehan Do you know this first hand?
@Lnbehan I know @_PPatterson_ very well and have traveled with him and served in the SBC with him.  I’ve watched him bully and disrespect more people than any other pastor I know. When you and @ScottColter go to the Patterson house next, ask him what else was in those documents he stole.

@Lnbehan It is very irresponsible to compare anyone to Jesus or the plight of anyone on earth to what Jesus faced.  I am so saddened by all of the people connected to @_PPatterson_ and @ScottColter making a mockery of the gospel to defend an indefensible position.
@Lnbehan That statement doesn’t make sense because @_PPatterson_ had the stolen documents in his possession that I have been referring to.  If we are talking about other documents, were you at the meeting?  If not where do you get your information?
@Lnbehan Who is on the executive board?  I find it hard to believe that @_PPatterson_ spends so much time place people on sbc boards all over the country and filled his own with people out to get him.
@Lnbehan Are you aware the person you describe is Jesus and not @_PPatterson_ ?
@fbcjaxwatchdog @Lnbehan @ScottColter @_PPatterson_ I prefer to drink the devils spirits on the roof while sitting in a lawn chair.  That way my mom doesn’t tell at me that it’s a school night and it’s past my bedtime.
@Lnbehan I changed my mind seems like you are just a blind follower of @ScottColter and @_PPatterson_  I will just see you all at #SBC18
@fbcjaxwatchdog @Lnbehan @ScottColter @_PPatterson_ I forgot you exist @fbcjaxwatchdog I should have asked you if any of you real fake Twitter watchdogs Jane considered what else was in those documents that left sebts?  Correspondence about suspicious financial activity and audits?
@Lnbehan I know absolutely personally that I am correct.  I will contact you privately if you would like. I’m not scared of @_PPatterson_ or @ScottColter so I will share about what I know first hand.  Will you publicly state you were wrong if I share the facts?
@DannyAkin You have always been one of my theological heroes.  You have been gifted by God for such times as these to speak the truth with charity and clarity, and for your ability to do that firmly but with love, I will just always be amazed.  Thank you for all you do.

@Lnbehan @ScottColter Also with all due respect @Lnbehan did you read the part of the letter about something that took place in 2015?  Do you think every single member of the board of trustees is out to get @_PPatterson_ ?  If he’s innocent why not let it play out so he can be exonerated?
@Lnbehan @ScottColter This story is incomplete and sinfully shameful @ScottColter continues to act as the mouthpiece for a man he no longer works for.  He is an employee of @swbts  correct?  Why does he have a job in putting out info from stolen documents?
@juancalderon @TerriBe59602687 @thecjpearson @Mike_Beacham @BillClinton @realDonaldTrump I dunno I feel pretty well informed
@TerriBe59602687 @juancalderon @thecjpearson @Mike_Beacham @BillClinton @realDonaldTrump No she didn’t
@TerriBe59602687 @thecjpearson @Mike_Beacham @BillClinton @realDonaldTrump Your Twitter handle ending with a bunch of numbers makes it clear you’re a troll.
@thecjpearson @Mike_Beacham @BillClinton @realDonaldTrump got elected and he’s raped plenty of women... so it’s not that
Hey @jamieloftusHELP and @edgarmomplaisir that guy @milesofgray just tracked me down, found my cell number called me just to say “hey this is Miles I am a journalist” and then he just hung up.  Does he ever do that to you guys?

@MaggieShlapman @pastorware @ScottColter The social media mob are those that would disagree with your position or the positions of their friends.  If you would just agree it would be something like a social media mass majority setting the record straight.
@fogfreefollower @pastorware Maybe someone should call Brandon to ask if he understands what he is saying?
Hey @bellevuepastor @jdgreear @KenHemphill I believe you all need to yield the time for these questions to be answered up front or be prepared to yield all leadership responsibilities back to the convention so we can elect leaders who will actually lead. https://t.co/s1YKUGlc4j
@SharayahColter @birchmanorg I feel like @birchmanorg should place you and @ScottColter under church discipline.
@SharayahColter I agree... so I’ve tweeted at you like 10 times so you need to remove that blog post designed to intimidate sexual assault victims down 80 times over.  @ScottColter I hope you would exert your headship over your wife as @_PPatterson_ has taught make her take it all down.
Is @pastorware or anyone at all going to address this? https://t.co/1L5iVVjFV2
@drdennislong @fogfreefollower @pastorware @GreenStreetBapt @compassion @swbts @ScottColter @Candi_Finch Amen.  I hope @brandonware would stop promoting these documents
@SharayahColter Have you consulted with @ScottColter on these issues?  Is @swbts allowing you all to spread these documents around?  What church holds your membership?
@SharayahColter That doesn’t give you license to keep on sinning though.  Has @swbts not covered Romans 6:1 with you all yet?  @SBCMeeting will make big moves to right the spread of these stolen documents designed to intimidate victims.  I know because I will make the motion if need be.
@Candi_Finch @SharayahColter @_PPatterson_ @swbts You are retweeting others that retweet your article?   That’s a Russian troll move and it’s embarrassing.  Step up your game and have more of those that idolize @_PPatterson_ spread it for you.
@SharayahColter If you mean what you say then you should remove those documents that blog and instruct your circle to stop circulating the documents and let the character of @_PPatterson_ stand on its own.  Your husband should probably be terminated and you should both be prosecuted.
@SharayahColter Who is the legal counsel?  Though you didn’t steal those documents you are spreading stolen documents intentionally it seems.  Is that a crime in Texas to impede the legal process can your counsel speak on that?
We owe it to our sisters in Christ to make big changes this year at the SBC.  The leadership and either yield the time needed to address these issues or they can yield their positions back to the convention at large for new leaders to be elected.  @bellevuepastor is there a plan? https://t.co/M2PjzvXfwj
@megannlively @thevincelively @DannyAkin @BruceAshford @PeaceChurchNC @peace_pastor @SEBTS @HeatherLipham @Docjonas @DH_Montgomery @AprilCArmstrong I can’t express how you have encouraged and convicted me this week.

@Wade_Burleson I reached out to she and her husband both to ask them to remove their blog posts.  I have been blocked.
Hey @jack_obrien tell your dad to relay to his bosses I am more than willing to teach the 76ers to use fake twitters accounts without getting caught.  You definitely have never considered even once that I am @annahossnieh
@LouiseMensch @DLoesch @NRATV @maddogpac @TrueFactsStated @Crocs @NRA @DeripaskaOleg @SheriffClarke @GOP Hate to burst your bubble @DLoesch but I know for a fact you’ve been funneling Russian money for years now.  Ask @GovMikeHuckabee about me.  Just as soon as I figure out how to reach out with anonymity to someone trustworthy I am going to spill the beans.  Do you remember me?
Can anyone in @SBCLIFE or @SBCCP tell me who runs SBC Issues?  @swbts you can all ask that @SharayahColter remove those documents or remove her husband from any and all leadership?  @_PPatterson_ loyalists, any of you want to come forward to say who runs that site?
https://t.co/9Cb4SrSDDo
I also sincerely believe it is the right and just thing to for @DallasPD or some other law enforcement to get involved.  Maybe @spulliam can shine light on this so we can expose the darkness to more effectively represent the light.
Also @SharayahColter I believe also that you, @_PPatterson_ and you husband should all turn yourselves in to @DallasPD to face the consequences of covering up rape.  I pray that you all would see the need to repent in the name of Jesus and the gospel.
Hey @SharayahColter I would like to humbly ask that you remove what you posted on SBC Issues.  I think what you did is awful and since you had stolen documents in your possession and you were bullying a possible rape victim, you should repent.
@jack_obrien Colangelo is a smart man... he had twitter handles with long numbers at the end just like the Russian Bots and Trolls.  Its absolutely  just a regular defender of large collars @ defnotbryancollangelo69193848757373
@jack_obrien I love to mock JR Smith, but I think in this case he just knew if he didn’t just turn and run he was going to get whistled for traveling, a technical foul, icing, a touchback or given a yellow card.  The best option is to play dumb and run to half court.
@atdanwhite @jack_obrien Is this guy addicted to Olive Garden?
RT @MarkWarner: The President’s ad hoc use of the pardon power is concerning enough. But the possibility that he may also be sending a mess…
@GOP I am also tired of treason and the @GOP covering for money laundering.  Let’s talk about all of it maybe we need totally new political parties.
Also be worried about God’s sick burn he pours out on all of those that use his name to manipulate others.  That one is going to be memorable too I think.  Good luck to you with your pardon I hope they never go looking into the rest of the crimes you told me you committed.
Hey @DineshDSouza I hope you resize that not only is @PreetBharara an incredibly well respected attorney.  He also has a PhD in the field of witty social media responses.  I eagerly await the sick burn that is definitely going your way from Preet.
@DineshDSouza @PreetBharara What a sick burn to @PreetBharara from a man that claims to be a Christian but is a crooked snake oil Salesman.  You know what’s worse than karma?  The wrath of God poured out on those that take advantage of the poor in His name.  You should read the Bible.
Hey @IfyNwadiwe he’s no longer a criminal I have to retract everything I’ve said about @DineshDSouza being a crooked lying thief. https://t.co/H9YRlX1GUV

@edgarmomplaisir @msdanifernandez @DailyZeitgeist @HowStuffWorks @IfyNwadiwe @nerdificent @jamieloftusHELP @BechdelCast I didn’t get invited either @edgarmomplaisir .  Don’t worry bro next time I have a pool party you are definitely invited and we will make sure to have crates of sprite available to you.
Hey @annahossnieh I enjoyed listening to you cohost behind the bastards.  You should make it a point to thank @jack_obrien for being not all that similar to Harvey Weinstein.
I really enjoyed today’s @DailyZeitgeist with @milesofgray @jack_obrien you guys are great!
RT @PreetBharara: God bless everyone who has risked life to protect America and our way of life. Thank you. #MemorialDay
@jack_obrien I always feel bad for guys that do that to guys like Lebron, Kobe, MJ.  It means the greatest players ever will play harder against you and that moment will come up constantly.  Someone should have Clyde Drexler teach a class on the detriment of pissing off a G.O.A.T
@edgarmomplaisir I am a little older so I’ve always had MJ and Kobe as my favorite two and considered them them best of all time.  Unfortunately, I might have to agree with you even though I desperately didn’t want to come to this position.   Sad day for me to admit Lebron’s place in nba history.
@Wade_Burleson Thank you for your boldness.  I was run out of ministry by third string disciples of Patterson that used his tactics and I didn’t have your tenacity or clarity so I just let it crush me.  I am encouraged Rick Patrick apologized like he did.
@jasoninthehouse @BillHemmer @SandraSmithFox @AmericaNewsroom @FoxNews I thought @jasoninthehouse would have been laying low these days because of his Russia money connections.   Guess treason is part of what @FoxNews looks for in a panelist
I want to talk to him about why he is a terrible representative to jesus and how he can just recognize lying and say to follow a lord that tells you to not deceive.  I also want to ask why he’s such a dick.
Hey @IfyNwadiwe some of my friends would do friendly Christian debates with @DineshDSouza and my friends told me he was a total idiot... then I watched several debates and saw he’s a rare form of uniquely dumb troll.  Let me know if you get a rise out of him
@tookmy20 @edgarmomplaisir @jamieloftusHELP @milesofgray I think @edgarmomplaisir and @jamieloftusHELP are equally as funny in different ways.
@RealSkipBayless His stats aren’t great but doesn’t seem like anyone else is playing better than him right now either.
@jamieloftusHELP @jack_obrien @milesofgray @DailyZeitgeist When is @DailyZeitgeist gonna take it on the road or start to do some special videos?  I bet its hilarious to see @annahossnieh try to keep everyone focused.
@edgarmomplaisir @jamieloftusHELP @milesofgray Why can’t you guys both be on at the same time and you can settle it Wild N’ Out style?  Both of you on at the same time is the only thing that can top @milesofgray impression of Quincy J. That or have @jack_obrien make a new show hosted by @edgarmomplaisir and @jamieloftusHELP
@epicfailsystems Our network that reports to a larger network just gobbled up 4 of the last remaining small practices in our city... score one for the Borg!  #resistanceisfutile
@epicfailsystems It just all really depends on usable.  If by usable you mean “an incredible hindrance to be used at multiple practices with a large hospital that requires multi millions of dollars to epic for their staff and consulting” then Epic is most useful EMR around.
@epicfailsystems Or if you need it done right... tell your Epic support team know so they can tell you to reboot and that your issue will be addressed in a future update.... or just having a charting system via sticky notes on your wall.  Either way its equally as effective.
@RepHollyGrange @NRA Let me apologize for thinking you didn’t spend time with the educators. I do sincerely hope you all actually try to do something that might be compromise on both sides so moving in the right direction could happen.  Also you can have @NCHouseSpeaker respond to me about his lies?
RT @NBCNews: WATCH: Thousands of North Carolina teachers rally in Raleigh for higher wages and better funding. https://t.co/XcEbqddj0r http…
hey @ncae next time @MyNCSenate try to deflect from the topics at hand with today's #NCTeacherRally ask them to discuss how they pass money through churches to fund their campaigns via @revMarkCreech
I used to be an employee of the tea party, so I am thinking some of the concerning tactics taken are things you wouldn't want the world to hear about.  The things @NCGOP @SCGOP did are more embarrassing than @GovMikeHuckabee 's jokes.
Hey @MyNCSenate and @SenHarryBrown looking at your state's roster of @gop	members, I think there are some questions to be had about you sending candidates to districts and if they even live in their district and how much the @NRA controls you gerrymanderers.  Let's talk.
if @MyNCSenate and @SenHarryBrown are so confident in their education numbers and positions... why have none of you returned my calls or emails in the past week?  None of them were marked Dr. Cranky Baptist or anything it had a real name on it.
hey @MyNCSenate and @SenHarryBrown you guys keep posting up what appears to be misinformation.  Who can I speak to to get some clarity?  DM me and let me know.  I am thinking that you want me to speak to no one and you wants the trolls and bots to retweet your message.
@MyNCSenate FACT:  You guys are lying and @GOP  and @NCGOP should be ashamed.  Can you publish links to your educational finance numbers about average pay?  Who compiled these numbers?  Are they familiar at all with statistics or math in General?
@Chad4Shotguns @debette_goldry did someone say anything about raising taxes?  Isn't part of the stand to demand the system be fixed?  Are you a real person?
Someone should tell @realDonaldTrump all those red shirts were marching through the streets of Raleigh in support of he and @BetsyDeVosED :) https://t.co/mItgfHZ0wF
@Chad4Shotguns @debette_goldry there are so few of those upper level government employees it doesn't make sense to deflect from the issue at hand.  What do you do for a living?  Why are so you so opposed to educators voicing their concerns today?
hey @NCHouseSpeaker I would like for you to speak about the accuracy of those teacher pay statistics.  If you don't I will run against you and 100% unseat you. Clock is ticking its your call bro.  @NCGOP brace yourselves for a new conservative wave if you fail to respond.
@NCHouseSpeaker th3 numbers you placed on the sign are pretty misleading.  I don't know if you are suffering ironically from an underfunded educational system or just a flat out fraud and liar.  You man enough to explain those numbers and averages?  @NCGOP  #NCTeacherRally #nced
@GKButterfield @HouseGOP you have way too many facts in this video.
This is why I am not surprised @ncleg bailed today on educators.  They are only interested in party over their people.  @ncgop and @gop should reform or move out of the way.	N.C. has the worst gerrymander in US history. What else is new? https://t.co/nlBX6NEshY
@jamieloftusHELP You also can't spell @jamieloftusHELP without these words https://t.co/kZW2noMipT
@repshepard why did you bail on @NCLeg meeting today so soon with so many educators wanting to talk?  Is that how you believe you should represent your constituency is to ignore #NCTeacherRally ? I can preach for you Sunday if taking more than an hour to govern is too much on you
@RepTedDavisJr why did you guys only meet for an hour today at #ncga when you had so many guests outside via #NCTeacherRally ?
i think @ProPublica should specifically look into the @NCLeg .  I have been researching that state's reps in light of #NCTeacherRally and its pretty sketchy.  Some of them run gun companies many don't live in their area.  Gerrymandering is bad enough, but it seems even worse.
hey @ChadBarefoot why did #ncga duck out today?  Avoiding #NCTeacherRally ?  You should tell your fellow legislators to tackle issues head on or to quit politics so a new generation can rise up to have some real dialogue.  They should also get on social media.
Hey @RepHollyGrange I was doing some research all on the representatives that dodged educators today and it seems like you run a mercenary company or something.  Can you elaborate? You too busy doing @NRA stuff to talk to teachers?
Education shouldn’t be a partisan issue.  @NCGOP you guys should stop ducking the people and relying on #fakenews and bots and @realDonaldTrump style lying and work across the aisle to bolster education in our state.  Or quit so we can get more cooperative politicians. https://t.co/2ropyzdGLg
@ChuckGore2 @West221B @NC_Governor I wish we could unravel all these bot accounts from these discussions.
Nah dude the #NCGA took it to the house and ducked out.  You should publish some numbers and emails that educators can call to compel these folks to respond.  You should also set the record straight as to what the average teacher makes it’s well below 50k https://t.co/550RV0Iu9O
@Chad4Shotguns @debette_goldry That is like saying we need to penalize every retired Walmart employee because the owners are billionaires.  That sign is incorrect unless you just average the pay scale.   You need more teachers to help you learn some math bro #RedForEd
@Chad4Shotguns These are mostly fake accounts and it appears the dialogue is being clouded by outside influence does @TwitterSupport care?
What’s up @ncae gonna let them push forward like today never happened?  #red4ednc https://t.co/INhdmyyZG9
I hope @crookedmedia had some candidates lined up to run against everyone in @NCLeg that opted to shut it down today because of protests by teachers.  #RedForEdnc #red4ed
@NCLeg I am real glad you guys got geared up for your one full hour of work.  Shame on every one of you for avoiding your guests by ending the session.  #Red4Ed #RedForEd
@NCLeg Doesn’t that mean you guys only felt like working for like an hour and then called it a day?  Took you guys longer to drive to the meeting than you actually met.  Will @WRAL or any other news stations ask why you let out so soon with so many visitors outside?
@edgarmomplaisir @jack_obrien @DailyZeitgeist I definitely  know you were being sarcastic and it was hilarious to me.  You guys have started up some of my favorite podcasts far and away.  Just get @IfyNwadiwe in this thread of how great all these podcasts are and I will rest easy.  Sorry to offend you if I did.
Also @edgarmomplaisir check out https://t.co/LYVKRjwNJD   They really have some cool stuff... I was about to buy a bunch of them for my staff and a bunch of Southern Baptist Employees.. but it seems like the security risk is a real issue.
Hey @edgarmomplaisir I am proud of your courage in letting @jack_obrien know he needs to get his toxic masculinity in check.  Also, you guys had me actually laughing out loud on @DailyZeitgeist today.  If you need some encouragement or want to hold hands just hit me up.
Hey @PreetBharara I don’t like you bullying people bro.  You and I both know the literacy rate in the House of Representatives is super low and you want to call out @RepDevinNunes because he can’t read??  What’s next?  Mocking @GovMikeHuckabee for not being funny?
Thanks again for this work seriously.
And hopefully maybe one day I don’t have to use parody twitter accounts if I don’t live in fear for my the sanity of my family knowing good and well the legal system will be used against me and that it will cost 1,000’s just to get back to even.
Thank you for the great piece and the great work, I have been praying this type of behavior would get coverage in hopes that one day our nation would address people that do this and maybe update our laws.
@pfraser7 I just saw your piece you put together called “tying up the courts”.  I have a relative that has been doing that for years and seems like law enforcement and the courts have gotten so frustrated dealing with him they prefer to push back on the victims.
Hey @LouiseMensch I don’t want to take up for creeps on either side or the political spectrum but I wonder if @realDonaldTrump is using the government to bring down some of his foes. Can you comment?
@RealSkipBayless Don’t worry bro no one cares.
Are the @culturekingspod going to replace @DammitCARL ?  If so I think it should really come down to myself or @jamieloftusHELP

Yo @DailyZeitgeist @annahossnieh I took that survey like 100 times.  I am supposed to fill out one survery each time Iisten to an episode right?
Moral of the story @DailyZeitgeist don’t mess with baby boomers and don’t mess with vape addicts.  They will come at you.
Part two, once the patient was taken care of, we had a great debate about that vape stuff.  One cop and a nurse got furious I referred to the vape thing as a crack pipe.  Not even a funny joke or original but it set these professionals off I trashed their love of vaping.
Hey @milesofgray good call staying out of the vaping debate bro.  I saw a patient at an emergency room near me to do a consultation and long story short had to get the cops involved because they vehemently disagreed they could not vape while hospitalized.
If my understanding is correct in that questions for @realDonaldTrump written by his lawyers, @seanhannity ‘s source is right.  Is his source @JaySekulow ?  Is @JaySekulow he leak to @nytimes also? What work does @JaySekulow do for @seanhannity ?
@IfyNwadiwe @midnight @hardwick @nerdificent @msdanifernandez I dunno man.  I think it could be his honor.  This time next year you guys will be too booked up with celebs for 3rd chair guest and he might have to have his agent get him in line behind a bunch of others.
@seanhannity Its cool you hashtag yourself.  Its like liking your own post on facebook.  Sad.  I am glad you won’t be able to tween when you and @MichaelCohen212 go to jail.
Also when I would lead ministry groups of college guys in church, I would discourage that notion you can’t have friends of the opposite sex.  If you can’t maintain a romantic relationship without being worried you might jump at some other woman over lunch, you have some problems.
I would like to speak to some members of @freedomcaucus are you all man enough to speak to a retired pastor or you just planning to help immoral @realDonaldTrump lie and avoid the public?  @GOP how does a private citizen schedule appointments? How much @NRA money is involved?
Hey @RepMarkMeadows how do your constituents contact you?  How can they meet with you face to face regarding your attempt to impeach justice department officials.  Can someone in @NCGOP let me know?  Same question for @RepDavidRouzer and @SenThomTillis
Yo @culturekingspod @jacquisneal @edgarmomplaisir I don’t like my wife seeing my text messages because of the childish and vulgar things I say to my best friends.  My wife also doesn’t care about looking through my text messages.  Trust is important.
Hey @RepMarkMeadows @TGowdySC @GOP I want an answer to this.  Do you guys see how many bots and trolls take over your social media conversations?  Have you ever looked at your own feeds if there’s traction or the commenters on @realDonaldTrump feed?  You don’t see anything wrong?
hey @IfyNwadiwe I miss @midnight .  Get @hardwick to go on your @nerdificent with @msdanifernandez bro.  Do it for me rekindle some of that old @midnight nostalgia.
@nytmike great reporting dude.  I was thinking about swearing you to secrecy and all that regarding who leaked the questions to you.  I changed my mind and you can definitely tell @maddow @FoxNews @seanhannity @CBSNews @HuffPost whoever that Cranky Old Baptist is your source :)
Hey @jamieloftusHELP are you able to give an update on swole sauce?  He didn’t kidnap you did he?  Being kidnapped by a swole gym rat trainer would be terrible with all that exercise and healthy food.  Hope you’re ok when does your job of taking over @DailyZeitgeist start?
@milesofgray @DailyZeitgeist @MichaelCohen212 You know I listened and forgot all about it. Please don’t kick me out of the zeitgang for this.
Hey @maddow you know @JaySekulow can’t answer questions at night... he is on Christian Broadcasting trying to sell his erroneous book to unsuspecting Christian people.
Hey @milesofgray can you guys talk about this on @DailyZeitgeist this week?  I an interested why Trump’s friend’s newspaper is trashing @MichaelCohen212 but I don’t want to actually buy a copy. https://t.co/3fAXxQ7SuD
Also @DailyZeitgeist @annahossnieh do you guys have your ad links posted on your site? I definitely buy stuff I hear advertised so if it’s listed somewhere I can find it easily when I am not busy working.   I will cancel my @RealAlexJones supplements for your stuff.
@jamieloftusHELP Same here.
Hey @milesofgray @jack_obrien @DailyZeitgeist I filled out your survey just want you to know you can sell my info all you want.  My favorite podcast might as well profit since the Russians and @NRA always has all my information anyways.
Heres some of the more violent ones... I don’t get into wrestling too much so there are probably some better ones real fans come up with.	https://t.co/JdNErhpypx
Hey @milesofgray  here’s a wrestling shoot video.  These are some of the least violent ones.  Look up this dude named New Jack if you want to see insane stuff when wrestling goes off script. 	https://t.co/LAMJxOArvu
I wonder if @RepMarkMeadows realizes the more he is on @seanhannity the tougher his re-election will be.  @NCGOP you guys need to step up your game and tell these dudes about the toxic companions.
I bet @realDonaldTrump will tweet less crazy stuff now that his Ambien dealer has been outed.  Smooth move Donald next time let your dealer live in the shadows and don’t nominate him to lead large organizations.
Bad news @realDonaldTrump I am being told that @MichaelCohen212 has already flipped.  He says since you can’t protect him anymore he’s to to do what’s right for his family. Hopefully @FoxNews will fill you in soon man it’s not looking good.
@TheMarkPantano What do you brainwashed @realDonaldTrump supporters snort?  Some kind of hallucinogen?
@TheMarkPantano What is a well regulated militia to you?
@GovMikeHuckabee @Delta You can have your cell mate rub your back once you end up in jail for money laundering and covering for @MichaelCohen212 and @realDonaldTrump
@GOP I don’t trust any of those people @GOP and I am an American citizen.  Please don’t include me with your blanket statements.  You guys are total liars and too scared to dialogue with me about faith issues even when I call email and write letters.
I have a lot of mutual friends with you @JaySekulow but I don’t think I’ve met you.  Are you a follower of Christ?  Where do you go to church?
@SheriffClarke since there are great odds you are going to somehow get tied up in some Russia stuff.  You seem like a crook.  You should remain silent and stop trying to get noticed by @realDonaldTrump @GovernmentRF @FoxNews @seanhannity @JaySekulow
Hey @LouDobbs you aren’t very good at the news.  Why does @FoxNews keep you?
I will begin my making sure you notice me by debunking some of your tweets.  Seems like all of them are just flat out wrong so it won’t take me long to start issuing corrections.  Let me know bro can’t wait to have discourse with liars like you.
Just let me know bro... it’s a win win.. I will call out your crazy lies you respond with an ignorant response... then your racist followers can mess with me.  As a troll I welcome the challenge.
Hi @benshapiro I read a bunch of your posts today and I think you are hateful and you have your troll followers harass people.  I would be fine if you give everyone a break and just have all of them harass me.
Hey @FoxNews who is representing @LouDobbs ?  @JaySekulow ?  Any other ways your staff is involved in the scandals?  Do you feel comfortable with how you all mislead your viewers?
Hey @milesofgray I try to avoid being a conspiracy theorist but I feel like at this point a ton of @GOP guys like Nunes Gowdy @jasoninthehouse act a certain way because they ultimately will be shown to have taken foreign money too.  Talk me out of my conspiracy theories.
@kawillert You guys are all some of the most talented people I’ve seen in the world.  I mean that.  Glad you made it to Jeopardy and hope you guys produce lots more one day soon!
RT @kawillert: HOLY SHIT. https://t.co/XKMucRoBj1
@GOP Good think you aren’t a senator.
Hey @MichaelCohen212 I am not sure but isn’t it some weird version of perjury if you lied about representing @seanhannity ?  Can you boys clarify which way it is because it seems inconsistent.  Can @ProPublica or @MSNBC or @FoxNews or @BillOReilly or @RealAlexJones help explain?
@seanhannity I would suggest @seanhannity learn the proper way to use quotation marks.  You right real good Mr. Hannity I see why @realDonaldTrump @PressSec like you u r so smart it crzy! L8r g8r
@GovMikeHuckabee @IngrahamAngle @FoxNews Hey @GovMikeHuckabee @FoxNews once all the money laundering stuff goes to the courts and your man @seanhannity is named in court I would think your horrible attempt at humor would stop.  Are you and @IngrahamAngle the same kind of fake Christian?  Is your daughter going to jail?
@seanhannity So basically you’re a liar and a modern day ringmaster of a circus or a snake oil salesman?  Just whatever you need to be to make sure your followers keep entertained and loyal to you?  Seems like idolatrous behavior to me.
Since your key leadership gets @MichaelCohen212 to help pay for the mistresses abortions and whatnot.  Just something to think about let me know.
I have a question for the @GOP are we changing our platform this year to be pro abortion and pro treason and pro crime?  Seems like if you let @MichaelCohen212 @GovMikeHuckabee @realDonaldTrump @seanhannity be the face of the party you might as well push all in.
Next time @SaraCarterDC @seanhannity have breaking news I sincerely hope they have made up new lies... I am tired of the current lies about @HillaryClinton .  Its time to expand your horizons, you aren’t tethered to the truth use your imagination give me something new.
@SaraCarterDC @seanhannity You breaking news about your own appearance?  That seems lame.
@NailsMagnum @culturekingspod @DailyZeitgeist @DammitCARL @milesofgray They are either the same person or they have some deep seeded beef and @jack_obrien @edgarmomplaisir &amp; @jacquisneal  have to keep them separated to maintain the peace.  Probably 50-50 shot either way.
@realDonaldTrump You are more a spy compared to most of us @realDonaldTrump .  You and your BFF Putin.  You are trying to get @RepDevinNunes Gowdy and others to get information for you to probabaly turn around and share with @GovernmentRF
@BookofJonah @seanhannity I would love to hear a reasonable explanation.
RT @iRun4Jules: @seanhannity hahahaha! called it! douche https://t.co/EI2eSf2GI2
RT @mademarest: @seanhannity  https://t.co/FBpzT62fTA
@milesofgray @MichaelCohen212 @seanhannity Just listened to @DailyZeitgeist for the day... I should just accept you media powerhouses are always two steps in front of me.  Great show yet again!
@milesofgray You guys should sell some merch. I would buy one of your mugs on that shelf.  Ha!
@seanhannity It really is truly deplorable to stand up for a liar like you and @realDonaldTrump .  God does not bless sin my friend.  God does not like your lies, @GovMikeHuckabee lies or the lies of @FoxNews you make me sad that you are so immune to the truth.
@milesofgray Did he mention the $10 dollars he gave @MichaelCohen212 so he could have attorney client privilege?  @seanhannity is bad for you bro.... you must be super high to be able to tolerate it.
@KdBrown357 @jamieloftusHELP @DailyZeitgeist You would be great as a third chair.  But if they can’t buy you a wallet and some headphones now, I think you see how this relationship will go.  If you need an inexperienced contract negotiator, let me know.
@milesofgray @jamieloftusHELP So she left some dollar store head phones and a debit card?  Seems like @jamieloftusHELP might need a wallet... have you ever considered making an amazon wish list and posting it on your wikifeet page?  Or using @DailyZeitgeist money to get a wallet?
@seanhannity Real estate deals with @GovernmentRF ? Like money laundering stuff?  @MichaelCohen212 is your man to help you launder money or if you sexually assaulted or harassed @FoxNews coworkers and need some hush money coordinated.  Let’s clear this up.

Hey @seanhannity can you specifically disclose what kind of real estate you discussed with @MichaelCohen212 ?  Was it some kind of financial benefit from @realDonaldTrump or @GovernmentRF ?  Is @FoxNews covering for you?  Answer soon.
Hey Deep State @jimmykimmel you sure did go really low in being a voice in this witch hunt by getting @seanhannity named in federal court as using @MichaelCohen212 .  How low can you stoop bro?  Gonna insult our national treasures @DiamondandSilk next?
@GovMikeHuckabee Funny you call anything sanctimonious.  Pot calling the kettle black with you Messiah Huckabee.  You and @PressSec should go to jail for misleading so many Christian people on purpose.  Do you believe Jesus is ok with your lies?
@politico I agree with you on this @SenThomTillis .  Supporting this allows for better checks on all presidents going forward.  I hope you follow through.
@STL_Blonde @politico @ThomTillis Hey @TwitterSupport this is another bot account
I am very concerned your staff speaks about you like this I hope you put them in your place.  Maybe the bald eagles of american justice grant you peace and mercy.
Hey @realDonaldTrump I was listening to @GovMikeHuckabee talking to his daughter @PressSec on the phone, and they were mocking you.  They called you ignorant, and Mike told her to stay strong and one that “Dumb Trump” would figure out to let smart people like her talk for him.
@bcolbert68 I don’t support @realDonaldTrump do you have a Russian Algorithm to block me or do you have to block me manually?  I hope you have to click some buttons to get rid of me.  No one really cares who you follow or don’t.
Hey @DineshDSouza you definitely committed some crimes dude, why would you lie?  Did you start that petition yourself?  Still waiting for you to slide up into my DM’s so we can discuss your Christian faith and maybe debate how a Christ Follower should behave on social media. HMU
@MichaelCohen212 @McClatchyDC I have heard some in the Trump family say for sure you were in Prague @MichaelCohen212 .  Not from whatever news site that you linked, but from a very close relative of @realDonaldTrump  that have known you for a long time.  You sure you weren’t in Prague then?
Hey @BillSimmons the documentary on Andre the Giant was absolutely fantastic. Everyone should watch it on @HBO right now.
The reason that I love @DailyZeitgeist @milesofgray @jack_obrien ... I had a draft of a tweet from a few days ago asking them to address @DiamondandSilk .. I didn’t even have to send it, they covered it anyway today!  You deep state liberals are good people in my book.
@SenatorRounds @007cigarjoe @StateDept Did you attend the same confirmation hearing I watched?  Seems like he wasn’t well liked.  What’s up with you @GOP guys do you live in an alternate reality?  Your constituents should ground you in this reality or vote you out of office.
@GOP How will you feel about this damage you are causing the next time the shoe is on the other foot?  You guys turning people public opinion of the rule of law is going to hurt everyone... not just the @DNC .  Stand for the truth and get better candidates if they fall short.
@DineshDSouza @realDonaldTrump You are one of the worst trolls I’ve seen.  I hope one day you repent and follow Jesus.  Praying for you @GovMikeHuckabee @PressSec @seanhannity and for your salvation and that you might find the jesus you so often disgrace.
Hey @LouDobbs when did you lose your mind?  Do you still have your mind and have lost your soul?  Do you believe what you say?  Or do you say what you need to say to be the team captain of the @FoxNews second string team?  How much do you get from the @GOP ?  @GovernmentRF ?
Or be willing to give an account for your treasonous and unethical actions.  @seanhannity and @IngrahamAngle are demonic heretics you should not associate with.
Hey @jasoninthehouse you shouldn’t be on @FoxNews  aren’t you scared the komprimat the Russians have on you regarding the Money Laundering of your companies and your affairs will go public if you don’t just retire quietly?  Does the @UtahGOP care?  Go quietly into the night...
@seanhannity @SebGorka @jasoninthehouse Is it fake news if like 30 people have been indicted?  Is the dossier still fake news if most of it has been proved or just yet to be proven but not disproven?  Does it even matter?  You can lie and be an arm of the @GOP and @realDonaldTrump and no one stands up.  Shame on you
@GOP Its insane that this party will use money and time to insult the justice department and the former fbi director who is a replublican.  @GovMikeHuckabee @FoxNews you should give people an explanation.
Who pays @DiamondandSilk ?  @GovernmentRF or @realDonaldTrump ?  How much do you make by being internet trolls?
@realDonaldTrump I am deeply worried about this factually false.  Does no one in the @GOP have the courage to even try to have these outright lies posted?  @marcorubio @JebBush ?  Anyone at all in the House or Senate?  @RandPaul ?  Be men of integrity and stand up for truth and dignity.
Hey @seanhannity @FoxNews @GOP @RepDevinNunes @RepMarkMeadows @RepDavidRouzer @realDonaldTrump you do you realize that these justice department guys you are attacking are a bunch of white dudes that vote republican? Does rule of law mean anything to any of you? Repent of lies.
If David and these kids learn how @GOP @FoxNews  and @NRA work together and funnel money for things through churches and super PACs to keep gun laws from changing, I am sure they will expose you.  If they want to know without looking hard, just DM me.
I am proud of @davidhogg111 and his classmates for what they are doing and I pray for their healing to be swift.  If you are a grown up with a platform and you decide to pick a fight with these kids, I think other adults should remove your platform.
I wonder if @robertjeffress @ronniefloyd and @jackngraham are still twisting reality to take up for @realDonaldTrump .  As teachers and elders in the church that belongs to Jesus preach truth and call out lies.  Even if its @FoxNews How do you stand now?
I wonder if the @ERLC is allowed to comment on the vitriolic lies that @FoxNews @seanhannity and @IngrahamAngle have good christian people believing?  Or was @drmoore barred from standing for truth by @LaBaptists ?  Jesus is better than @GOP
If you support a party like the @GOP  and get your news from a place like @FoxNews  that continues to mock and bully the living victims of a school shooting, its time to stand up and demand more civil discourse and classier conservatism.  Talking to you @FBCJAX
Hey @realDonaldTrump how come I can’t get a follow back?  Help a conservative pastor that is a little on the fence about our president feel more confident and you and to help get me some twitter traction.  If you follow me I won’t call you little hands anymore.
I always thought highly of my friends in NC, but now that you have @SenThomTillis @RepMarkMeadows and @DavidRouzer all being elected by Russian money, using russian hacking tools, I am wondering what is wrong.  Can’t even find better members of the @GOP ? Time for a new party.
Was Zuckerberg scared to mention @facebook biggest competition in front of congress????  I didn’t hear one word about @Myspace or @GooglePlus .  He’s scared they are nipping at his heels.  @realDonaldTrump you should sign up for MySpace.
Hey @milesofgray I think the beef between @DailyZeitgeist and the @nytimes TheDaily would be such like east/west.  If you and @mikiebarb are biggie and Tupac, who is @jack_obrien ?  Is he Suge Knight or @Diddy ?  Please don’t try to be no limit studios.
Hey @SenThomTillis are you still working to get promises that the line of succession won’t fire Mueller?  Or did the @GOP put a stop to that?  How about @DNC ?  Is anyone trying to bring legislation to prevent a constitutional crisis.  Or, just political theatre?
@msdanifernandez When I was an actual pastor that was my advice to college students... that it doesn’t make you a bad person to recuse yourself from a situation with a bunch of red flags regardless of the situation.  In striking a balance with trust and safety, stay safe.
@seanhannity @jimmykimmel @Disney You know @seanhannity I am thinking you are jealous of @jimmykimmel and his social media strength.  I suspect you are trolling him so you can take advantage of his following.  Sad you arent popular enough to get your own large following.
Very glad you are back @jamieloftusHELP !  I really tried to get some old friends help you get your twitter back but none of them were willing to mess with the IOC.  These friends have no problem going to Syria to help refugees but say IOC is worse than that situation.
@RandPaul @EPAScottPruitt @realDonaldTrump Nice to see @RandPaul prove his ideology is incredibly inconsistent and breaks down when it comes down to someone like @EPAScottPruitt and his theft of american tax payer money via his insane decisions.  I bet your daddy is proud Rand.  I know @GOP likes it.
Hey @BorisEP I’ve been thinking.  Do you consider Sinclair to be a legitimate news organization?  If I could point out lies your company has made would you be willing to admit and correct?  Or just play Whataboutism?  You are a wannabe @FoxNews or @RT_com
@BorisEP @gmukunda @realDonaldTrump @PreetBharara You know what makes no sense?  That Sinclair media can make any sort of claim to be a legitimate news organization.  You people are liars that prey on the fears of people.  I assume you are independently treasonous though, not paid by @GovernmentRF
Also I laughed harder than I’ve ever laughed with @milesofgray did his Quincy Jones reading.  I went to explain to my boss and, no lie, he was like “man you’re part of the zeitgang too?”  So there are two of us @DailyZeitgeist lovers over on the east coast!
Hey @DailyZeitgeist @milesofgray and @jack_obrien when I don’t lock my phone sometimes it rubs in my pocket and it will skip one way or another.  Any suggestions with my specific situation?  I think it’s your fault somehow.

Hey @milesofgray @DailyZeitgeist @jack_obrien I think @Costco should pay you guys because based on your discussions, I am going to get my first costco membership tomorrow.
Hey @edgarmomplaisir and @jacquisneal @culturekingspod how come no one is talking about the Toronto Raptors?  Y’all hate Canadians?
. @milesofgray you may have really set yourself up for an embarrassing situation by giving an open challenge for fifa on PlayStation. If you need someone to deflate your ego a bit just let me know.
@alexcady4 @doublel71 @marcus_metcalfe @flathead4343 This most certainly is the real account of @realDonaldTrump .  Trying to sell some garbage gives it away
@edgarmomplaisir @Nickelback Dang I was halfway joking but I just looked it up and they do have a lot of hits and a bunch of songs I liked.  I rescind my junk talking of a band.  Since I have no talent in music I shouldn’t judge any talented people anyway.
Hey @edgarmomplaisir did @Nickelback write more than that one song This Is How You Remind Me?
@stephbelding @FlashCadillack @maxwelltani @TVAshleigh Amen.  Same advice I would give @realDonaldTrump and @k80way .  Be upset thats fine.  Then go journal.  Just don’t send it to anyone.  You will then have had a creative outlet AND not embarrassed yourself in front of many.
I mean @k80way  has a point.  Check out all the other stuff she has written over at @babedotnet .  My advice to you @k80way don’t act like you’ve done anything remotely credible.  Feel free to come at me I am 100% behind #Metoomovement but think you are no journalist. https://t.co/DQ7dzMk2eJ
The people at @babedotnet ruined a mans career and have not had a single news scoop or story since and had not had one before their Aziz piece.  How come @CNN @MSNBC @CBSNews @abcnews @HuffPost don’t follow up and mention that @k80way seems like a fraud and not a journalist?
@babedotnet This is just a hard hitting piece of journalism... have you posted anything else other than those claims that lady made about Aziz as seriously journalism?  Where one of you spurned by him?  Is there a real person that went on a date with him?  Was it your editor? Any follow up?
@k80way I wonder why this hard hitting reporting isn’t being picked up by @CBSNews ?  You have any more substantive pieces coming up?  Or just that one about Aziz and that’s all you will ever find?
@GovMikeHuckabee I miss hanging out with you @GovMikeHuckabee .  Jesus also misses you seems like you’ve left him behind as well.  Are you in bed with @NRA ?  you in bed with the @GovernmentRF that gives money to @NRA to give to @realDonaldTrump and @PRyan ? Or just a @FoxNews dummy? Ur a liar
. @RepLeeZeldin All of the responses, or a huge number of them, are actually fake troll accounts.  Do you realize that?  Do you care?  You are getting traction to protect treasonous people by the foreign agents in question.  Do you take their money too?  R u Treasonous 2? HMU!
@DineshDSouza People see you as a malevolent liar that is a fear mongering fraud.  Some of them also say you totally sucked when you tried to run a college.  Some of them also said you had a girlfriend with you that wasn’t your wife.  Should we judge books by their adulterous cover?
@GOP @realDonaldTrump What can they obstruct?  You have the majority in both houses and the White House?   You need to get @GOP on the same page.  Or stop being racists that protect a crazy man in the White House and you will probably have some better party unity.
Enjoyed the newest episode of @culturekingspod with @IfyNwadiwe as a special guest... always a great show!
Hey @milesofgray I think you should cover your own local story in the crazy deja vu theories perpetuated by your boys on @culturekingspod .  It a hilarious theory that seems parallel to flat earth ideas.
Hey @IfyNwadiwe if you want to work your way toward a cardiac event by crushing bronkaid but also save some money... let me know I work for a large healthcare network I can send you some coupons man.  Speed keeps you sharp man don’t let them convince you drugs are bad.
@DailyCaller You Nazis are hilarious
I have to fact check you guys @DailyZeitgeist sorry to blow up your guest’s spot... Paregoric does have opium in it but it’s still used today for nausea and diarrhea especially in people that travel a lot.  It’s a lot like other cough syrups you can get from doctors today.
How about this a friend sent me...   https://t.co/1ebtoRDGfu
@milesofgray Is this like a cleanse diet you are doing?  Mediocre food that will not stay inside of you more than 30 minutes....
@jasoninthehouse @realDonaldTrump Good move @jasoninthehouse on trying to deflect from @realDonaldTrump and @FoxNews and @NRA treason and collusion.  You still took money from Russians for your campaigned and they still have you compromised though.  Retire from Office quietly.
Who is this @RepDavidRouzer guy?  Does he also claim to be a Christian but perpetual lies? Or does he just Perpetuate lies?  Does he speak with the people or ignore anyone wanting to dialogue?  Money says he’s rank and file @GOP coward funded by @NRA
@RepDavidRouzer I pray that over time your constituency become more informed on this issue and vote you out of office for compromising national security and respect for intelligence agencies in exchange for staying in good with nazis and @realDonaldTrump Do you believe in Jesus?
@RepLeeZeldin are you aware most of the accounts that interact with you are bots and trolls?  Do you care?  Just because they feed your ego and make you look good to @realDonaldTrump I bet you don’t care.  You should not be in congress.  You seem dumb.
Hey @milesofgray I think @jack_obrien was so busy getting ready to take the week off he forgot to tell you he asked me to cohost with you this week.  No need to bother him to confirm he’s real busy, just call me when it’s time to be on I’ll be ready.
Congrats in advance to @jack_obrien on the birth of later this week.  I always admire successful people that can find a good work/life balance because I never can.  Jack seems to love both his real family and treats his work son @milesofgray well too. Congrats! @DailyZeitgeist
@JacobAWohl @BenningtonGal That’s insane.  Your talking point is @NRA nonsense.  You white nationalists should go develop a private social networking app to spew your crazy.
@Conservativeind @realDonaldTrump @Twitter I’m rubber and you’re glue...
@Conservativeind @realDonaldTrump @Twitter Isn’t your last name moron in Russian?  I am not very bright.  I didn’t realize you twitter people would be so mean to me.  Think I will cry and go learn to knit.
This was before Obama, but this family was worried about when the government would be coming for them.  They shortly after that paid a lot of money to have a confederate flag pole and straight up confederate statue in their yard.I will send a picture if I can find it.
Hey @DailyZeitgeist I had a friend that showed his dad’s guns to us.  I told my dad who then mentioned it to his dad.  My dad was called a sissy coward that needed to “learn to be a man”... turns out a bunch of guns were hidden in their guest bathroom.  Dad didn’t let me go back.
@Conservativeind @realDonaldTrump @Twitter I have always voted @GOP for the most part.  Are you a troll or a bot and why has your account not been shut down?  Gonna hit me with that poop emoji statement of other trolls or send me some graphic proving you aren’t a bot or troll?
@larryelder You lost the trolls then the trolls complained so the @GOP  and @GovernmentRF trolls got to come back.
Yo @DailyZeitgeist I am very encouraged to hear those high school kids grill Marco like that.  When I was helping with a campaign I tried that even behind closed doors and it was just not going to happen.  @GOP does not allow for follow up questions I don’t think.
@Conservativeind @realDonaldTrump Are you offering to sell assault rifles to anyone anywhere?  That is a concerning offer.  Is @Twitter ok with this?
A childhood friend of @jack_obrien says: Hey Jack what does your dad do? Want to come get some steak at our house after school?  	Jack:  My dad is an NBA head coach.  What’s steak?  Pictured below: Filet mignon seared by your Baptist Boy.  Gotta use some butter and salt. https://t.co/u1iI48WTni
@davidbix I think even horrible monsters know when to keep your head down and live to fight another day... or live to film more insane propaganda films another day.
Hey @DailyZeitgeist @milesofgray I like to try to verify the veracity if the claims that comedians make... I can confirm that @IfyNwadiwe is in a car commercial.    Good for you man no one ever let me be in a car commercial I am jealous! https://t.co/6FqSwzyIvy
He is truly terrible.  Billy Graham would have asked him what lessons has he learned and how we find strength in our weaknesses.  Batman’s butler would give similar advice either way @DineshDSouza should listen and stop fear mongering and cheating Christians
In the last debate he had the Christian Pastor that was supposed to be on his “team” in this debate got fed up with him and instructed him to have more respect for people of different faith backgrounds.  @DineshDSouza I hear threatened to sue that guy too.
He’s valuable to @GOP and @FoxNews because he’s a minority and supposedly an academic elite type... I called into question his academic credentials and dude was ferocious and threatened to sue me and a campus organization so we would not question his stature.
Also @IfyNwadiwe that dude @DineshDSouza is the biggest asshole I ever met in my time in ministry I met him while he was poorly debating in academic circles.
@DailyZeitgeist you guys reminded me of the multiple times things got heated with family members and church people regarding information coming from Email forwards and memes.  It blows my mind how baby boomers can brush off the argument of “that’s factually untrue”
@seanhannity @ByronYork @GreggJarrett Is Nunes not in jail yet?  How does @FoxNews feel about lying and fear mongering?
I am very happy with #twitterlockout. I spent almost two years following bots and trolls and observing.  I hope @Twitter has another purge it will save me some time and the time of getting a new twitter account.
@seanhannity @kayleighmcenany @SebGorka @dbongino @ByronYork @GreggJarrett @SaraCarterDC @jsolomonReports @TomiLahren @charliekirk11 How did you land Gorka and @TomiLahren ?  Are there no @infowars or Nazi meetings tonight?  You guys at @FoxNews really must need to fear monger some old people by getting all your weirdos together in one show.  Be proud @GOP such top notch representatives
@GOP @realDonaldTrump Paycheck president is a dumb tag line.  As a new generation of conservatives starts to make our move to have a party more representative of our convictions and not beholden to @NRA I appreciate you posting these dumb promotions for future campaigning :)
@TXRedPilled @SparkleSoup45 They were all bots.  I’ve been watching you people operate for a while now.  Not sure why your account was spared i guess you are a troll and not a bot.
@roicurry They were all bots.  Trust me.  I’ve been hanging with bots for like two years I can spot a bot from a mile away now.
@Mike_Press19 @TerryLynnWhite2 I’m positive they were all bots.
I hope that @DailyZeitgeist @jack_obrien and @milesofgray let Jamie Loftus know I will gladly be her twitter proxy... I can be her Russian bot until she gets her account back.
@jack_obrien @hamburgerphone @DineshDSouza I met @DineshDSouza several years ago and have been watching him take advantage of Christian people via fear mongering.  People like him make me sick.
@realDonaldTrump That dossier is dirty.  It’s almost all been proven true now and so one day soon @FoxNews @GovMikeHuckabee @PressSec @seanhannity @IngrahamAngle will have to discuss the part where you had hookers urinate for your pleasure while in @GovernmentRF you’re a pervert
I wish that @IngrahamAngle would remove her necklace that represents a loving savior in Jesus.  If @FoxNews lets you be racist, the least you can is not misrepresent Jesus.  Repent of your racism and your hateful ways.  Also, @GovMikeHuckabee you are still a heretic.
@LadyReverb @JurassicNPS @BoardGameBrawl So very interesting you guys say identically the Same thing and try to trick us into thinking its just something coool to
@LadyReverb @JurassicNPS @BoardGameBrawl I am way better than you at being a suspected bot.  Hopefully @GovernmentRF sends me some money. https://t.co/DyTUCWrJQA
@LadyReverb @JurassicNPS @BoardGameBrawl Hey @LadyReverb I am pretty sure you are a bot or troll you have 64 thousand tweets you are just trying to cloud up the conversation between me and @BoardGameBrawl
@BoardGameBrawl @JurassicNPS Jokes on you bro.  I have no thoughts or processes.
@Cernovich @solmartpropert1 It starts to really construct a highway toward collusion though.
@jasoninthehouse “Coconspirators not yet indicted but known to the grand jury” seems like a line to be very worried about if I am @realDonaldTrump seems you have more information than you let on @jasoninthehouse and you are pushing an article you know for sure is skewed.
@jasoninthehouse Where were you?   Why are you retiring?  Are you also involved with the Russians?  Many many sources say they are blackmailing you and that you will get caught up in a broad sweeping investigation of Russian funding politicians.  Can you comment?  @FoxNews
@PrisonPlanet Fake news isn’t when sources lie.  That’s irresponsible journalism.  Fake news is the mess you peddle round the clock as a troll.
@BoardGameBrawl @JurassicNPS Also does it hurt your feelings Bernie was mentioned in the information?  Is that what makes you so passionate?
@BoardGameBrawl @JurassicNPS Regardless of if it was swayed one way or another there is no mechanism to fix it in our country so I don’t think you need to relitigate.  I just think you shouldn’t minimize the problems of 216 that are coming out from one ongoing special counsel investigation.
@BoardGameBrawl @JurassicNPS I think it’s a complicated both/and I also think you vastly underestimate the impact @FoxNews has on baby boomers.  If they were giving chunks of time to people that were giving the same talking points as Russians, then you have influenced a large swath of voters.
@JurassicNPS I hung out with him once at a political thing... they stuck me with him like people stick you talking to a weird relative during the holidays.  He’s a creepy dude and seems like a genuinely terrible person.
@JurassicNPS @BoardGameBrawl There is a large segment of the world that has their mental framework shaped by stuff like memes and tweets and Facebook posts.. many of my relatives think if it’s on the internet it must be trust insofar as it proves them right.  You sound kind of pretentious to minimize this.
@FoxNews @BillClinton Too bad @FoxNews propaganda and their money machine combined with the complicit murderers of the @NRA won’t let that happen.  Politicians like @marcorubio can’t be for any gun legislation or they will lose millions.  Take responsibility for your part in this mess.
I’m up waiting for @realDonaldTrump to start tweeting.  Too bad he’s too scared of that Mueller guy to talk too much.  Didn’t realize @POTUS is such a coward. Maybe @DonaldJTrumpJr will be bold enough to tweet today.  He’s much more brave than his dad.
@Thomas1774Paine He should have been investigated after Wicker Man for the torture he puts the American people through.
I wonder how @FoxNews @GovMikeHuckabee @ShepNewsTeam and the rest sleep at night when @lauraingle is a racist?  I guess they sleep just as well as when @seanhannity outright lies.  I hope your propaganda is investigated by @FBI to see if you have @GovernmentRF ties.
@IngrahamAngle Was he right to sexually harass Anita hill?    Was he right to ask about pubic hair to her?  You did that alt right dog whistling racism when you told him to shut up and dribble. @lauraingle and @FoxNews must be racist since they allow it.
@petefrt how have you tweeted half a million times?  Will @TwitterSafety start to intervene now that some of your fellow@trolls have been caught? Maybe @FBI or @INTERPOL_HQ will start finding ways to freeze accounts and money association with their creation and operation.
@miskrzys @Torst525 @instapundit @KurtSchlichter @Twitter If you’re “asking for a friend” helping a foreign enemy nation on many levels is illegal just ask the American that entered a guilty plea yesterday.  You should turn yourself in have a feeling @GovernmentRF might extradite you unless you’re an oligarch.
@miskrzys @Torst525 @instapundit @KurtSchlichter @Twitter I would love to engage with you but the fact you have 70 followers and you’ve tweeted 4500 times makes me realize you’re a troll that’s probably being paid to spread disinformation.
@submandave @Torst525 @KurtSchlichter @instapundit What does that mean ?  Is that the new Russian slang for be week?
@yankee_bailey @Torst525 @instapundit @KurtSchlichter The indictment has nothing to do with talking and a lot of stolen identities and banking transactions.
@IngrahamAngle @realDonaldTrump Because he’s a threat to our republic as a whole and has fear mongering racists like you and @FoxNews available to manipulate large swaths of the population.  You should be ashamed and repent of your lies and your racism.  @KingJames can speak his mind if he wants.
@yankee_bailey @Torst525 @instapundit @KurtSchlichter Yes.  It’s kind of a long document check it out and we can talk more.  Thanks for being reasonable have a good night!
I hope one day to be able to shake @LouiseMensch ‘s hand and to know how she scooped every a year early.  I honestly wasn’t real sure about you... but now I am a believer in your information.  Good job!
@yankee_bailey @Torst525 @instapundit @KurtSchlichter Incorrect.  There’s are a number of ways it could end up illegal.  One of them is for foreign people to spend money on us elections.  I shouldn’t even have this conversation I am just helping the troll farms get some traction.
@miskrzys @Torst525 @instapundit @KurtSchlichter Nah my troll or bot friend.  Read the indictment you will see the laws that are allegedly violated.  Read it first then hit me up with your dumb questions to cloud the discourse.  @Twitter this is also a series of fake accounts
@OldDarkAngel @FooteAl @Torst525 @instapundit @KurtSchlichter You don’t seem to have a very firm grasp on the English language.  I have no idea what you are trying to say.  I actually have no idea how to use Twitter and I am a registered @GOP and seriously worked for the tea party.  Just don’t like treason and bots and trolls.
@Torst525 @KurtSchlichter @instapundit @TwitterSupport @FBI Hey @Twitter @MSNBC @ProPublica I have been fascinated with trolls and bots for a few years now.  It’s all amping up again tonight I messed with a troll and with literally two minutes had thousands of impressions.  @GovernmentRF moving at full force with no resistance.
@Torst525 @KurtSchlichter @instapundit Hey @TwitterSupport and @FBI these accounts I interact with are obviously collaborating to spread misinformation as we speak.  Also Mike Flynn sent me a DM.  Why can’t we get some common sense enforcement of these that muddy the already cloudy water or online discussion. #alltalk
@Torst525 @KurtSchlichter @instapundit Yes my Russian troll bot friend.  Read the thing in its entirety.  It cites the specific laws allegedly violated.  If you need it translated to Russian or Redneck let me know @GovMikeHuckabee is fluent in both and can help.
@TrumpPenceUSA1 @robreiner @GOP initially paid for dossier.  Not treason for Clinton to try to influence the election that’s called campaigning.  This account that posted this is a bot I hope you get indicted too.
@JackPosobiec @HorseShort That doesn’t change how they influence the election that’s an incredibly irresponsible and ignorant thing to say. Be a man and defend your position in how that will keep Russia from spreading propaganda.  Also wanting voter id factually just keeps minorities from voting. U racist
@maggieNYT @errollouis Stein was also at that same dinner as Flynn in @GovernmentRF .
@KurtSchlichter @instapundit It’s definitely not legal for foreign entities to influence our elections.
@babedotnet You and every other outlet than @FoxNews also verified no one is getting beaten up at those movies.  You guys are garbage.
@babedotnet This is again just a classy post that further reinforces your journalistic integrity.  You guys are trash.
@DineshDSouza It sounds just like the life that @DineshDSouza and @GOP want for the American people.
This is an odd video.  Can you make one of these @hamburgerphone ? https://t.co/FNb9dDWctu
@SWAIM_CORP This was a great episode!
Also, one of the few times I worked up the courage to play a raid outside of my circle of friends, I only put in around 400 hours and had troubles with a jump.   Several 14 year olds shouted at me with very troubling insults.  I will stick with Fallout.
Hey @SWAIM_CORP learned of your new podcast from @DailyZeitgeist .  Its great.  One of my best friends is a destiny addict doesn’t understand why I didn’t come home from work with the desire to do more work by farming for tokens and weapons so I can farm for more tokens.
@SebGorka @piersmorgan Are you still on the run from Hungarian authorities @SebGorka ?  You should fall silent on Twitter.  You are either completely insane or a completely evil liar.
@annahossnieh @DailyZeitgeist That’s very un-dope for them to be trolling you like that when you are their super producer.  Makes them real todgers!
Hey @DailyZeitgeist I want you to know that even though I don’t understand the language of young people I definitely agree with @annahossnieh the new Snapchat is definitely not lit.  The SNAP changes of mailing food boxes also not very lit.  Is turnt still something people say?
Hey @crookedmedia @jonlovett @jonfavs @danpfeiffer you guys said @NRA is simply a @GOP run organization I need to correct your #fakenews its not run by the GOP its run by @GovernmentRF .  Please make this correction to your audience.
@GOP The found Yahweh god had a son named Jesus that he sent to live the life we could not live and to die the death we should have died to pay the price we could not pay.  In light of that you guys might want to repent and stop being liars.  You too @GovMikeHuckabee and @FoxNews
@culturekingspod When y’all gonna make it to the deep Deep South?  Maybe Toby Keith can be your opening act.
Hey @DailyZeitgeist is this dude really a @GOP candidate for House of Representatives?  If so, think you can book him for an interview?  His wiki says he was on Jerry Springer at one point, so I bet he would go on your show.	https://t.co/4DUswP71E2
Hey @GOP  what’s up with candidate Art Jones?  	https://t.co/4DUswP71E2		Do you guys support this guy and allow him to be on your ticket?

@IfyNwadiwe You might need to hire someone like @Scaramucci to clean up your crew to get these leaks stopped.  You don’t want the real serious stuff like your plans to get rid of @jack_obrien in order to... you know what nevermind I’ve said too much already. Excited about your new show!
Hey @culturekingspod metal gear solid games were some of my favorites also even though some of it was so convoluted the stories made no sense.
I think @culturekingspod let a secret slip about a possible podcast with @IfyNwadiwe coming soon.  I hope it’s true and if it is just remember if you need a cohost that isn’t very funny that used to hang out with dudes like @GovMikeHuckabee I am ready ASAP.
@zazmaster107 @staceypmcatee @hamburgerphone @DailyZeitgeist Do you refer to yourself as swolesauce in your day to day life outside of the internet?
It wouldn’t be uncommon for me to speak in front of thousands of people in a church or church event.  So screw those trolls your stuff was dope. If nothing else, your videos are definitely better than any videos that your old company has put out in 2018.
I wanted to say to @jack_obrien when you were downing your own videos at that old company you were with, but I thought they were seriously top notch I really did.  That spit take you referred to was hilarious and until my recent ministry break
Really enjoyed today’s episodes of @DailyZeitgeist and @culturekingspod everyone should make it a point to listen to them!
@zazmaster107 @staceypmcatee @hamburgerphone @DailyZeitgeist I hope you also learned your lessons in that you shouldn’t degrade and woman for cheap laughs and simultaneously never apologize because @hamburgerphone will hustle the shit out of you.  I feel lucky she hasn’t hustled me.
@jacquisneal @milesofgray We thought it would be one of his last matches... it was like 2004 or 2005... but turns out he just kept on wrestling and will never stop.  My favorites of all time are the rock and hbk.   I would tune in just to hear the rock talk junk.
@DineshDSouza @realDonaldTrump I would think @realDonaldTrump wouldn’t want to speak to him because of all those crimes he committed and his Mob friends and the weird allegations with trump models.  Seems like he might crack by being confronted with his sins.
Also,  I started screaming “someone is hurting my granddad please help him he fell off a ladder and can’t get up” and WWE security didn’t think that stuff was funny at all.  So... wrestling is silly... but gotta respect people that dedicated to entertaining the crowd.
It was insane dedication to his art form to know in advance he was going to have that happen to him and still do it.
Hey @jacquisneal and @milesofgray I drove with my friends one time to see Monday night Raw to see Ric Flair wrestle.  That dude got pushed off a ladder in the ring to the outside of the ring and hit his head on the railing.
This is what being a criminal politician looks like.  Good job @RepDevinNunes for getting a photo op with one of the worst human beings in the world in @SebGorka who gives themself the name of Dr. G? https://t.co/1DV7kdub1S
@hamburgerphone How did it go?
RT @PreetBharara: According to this article, Trump's own lawyers think he is a liar: his "lawyers are concerned that the president...has a…
@DineshDSouza Yes.  It’s really apply the same logic you people used against the clintons.  Try again liar you are still just part of a sinful brood of vipers that’s lies and preys on nice people of faith.
@hamburgerphone You are hilarious so I am sure you will kill... all else fails just talk about those magicians and drummers.  You seem like you could have dated a LARPER i bet so that’s something definitely funny. so you just do you!  You really are hilarious good luck!
@hamburgerphone I spoke at a church one night for an Easter event and I had a 104 temp from sole complications with an appendectomy.  I’m told it’s the funniest I’ve ever been and preached my best sermon ever.  So... just give in to whatever thoughts the fever brings your way. You will be great!
@hamburgerphone @DailyZeitgeist I did think of something but its quite personal and I would hate to offend your sensibilities, but is there a difference in regular Nacho Cheese Dorito Dust UTI and the Cool Ranch variety?
@DineshDSouza You are just lying.  Do you do it for profit or are do they have intel on you or are you just ignorantly insane?
I pride myself on always having a snarky retort that at least I think is funny.  But when I heard the phrase “dorito dust uti” I just didn’t have any words.  Well done @hamburgerphone and @DailyZeitgeist for making me laugh so hard.
Hey @hamburgerphone I think this swolesauce guy could be a magician and/or drummer in his spare time.   Be careful.  Also I would like you to Venmo me like $2 per piece of unsolicited romance advice I provide.
Last thing @milesofgray and @jack_obrien .  That’s totally a troll and probably not an American account,  it I found her response to be hilarious.  If the trolls were this funny all the time, they we be able to control me to believe whatever. https://t.co/gVgnVv5Fd5
I am also willing to go @FoxNews to have the same debate.  Or we can just hang out and be bros bro.  I just want to make sure you don’t have Russians lurking around you and saying they will leak your pee tape if you don’t write a four page report.
Hey @DevinNunes I a Republican but have some comerns about what you’re doing.  It seems insane... are you ok?  Is your family ok?   Those bad Russians you’ve been taking money from calling in favors now?  Would love to talk maybe we could go on @DailyZeitgeist and we can debate.
Hey @DailyZeitgeist have you guys talked about the number of republicans that won’t be running for re-election?  Like @TGowdySC and Jason chafetz or however you say his name.  Think Russian as some more pee pee tapes on these @GOP dudes?
Hey @milesofgray the best unappreciated music video of all time is Victory with Busta and Biggie in it.
Hey @milesofgray and @jack_obrien read this:  https://t.co/Ac5K8iW59T.  You guys I think are right to talk about what crazy plans furor seems to be...
Hey @realDonaldTrump can I get a follow?
RT @PreetBharara: Some people hate this president BECAUSE they love this country https://t.co/B03e3mXKTz
@DineshDSouza Hey @DineshDSouza I troll you a lot but I completely agree... its offensive to make such assertions and I pray people on both sides of the aisle condemn this guy for doing that.
@JacobAWohl @Comey Don’t be fooled by @JacobAWohl he’s a Zionist white supremacist and admits it openly you should not dignify him with any responses
@ChuckGrassley Too bad @TGowdySC is just trying to avoid jail gotta do what you gotta do.
RT @TheOnion: Panicked Donald Trump Jr. Tries To Cover Up Contact With WikiLeaks By Deleting Firefox Icon From Desktop https://t.co/95G3WyW…
@LouiseMensch I know Gowdy has been laundering money for years through churches and non profits back through political action leagues and then back into his own pocket.  I am thinking he is a little worried about what names get named in collusion soon.
Congrats to @TGowdySC for being he latest member of the @GOP to realize you’ve committed far too many crimes for @realDonaldTrump to not end up in deep trouble.  If you are looking for work I think @crookedmedia is hiring.  I think you and @jonfavs would really hit it off.
Hey @jack_obrien I was very confused when you said your producer had you announce “boner alert” and I thought she was saying Kaine gave her boners.  I was deeply concerned and confused for a moment.
Sorry I didn’t have an awkward dumb joke... but I thought it was a good serious point you made.
Its @FoxNews for real its like the only source of info for white baby boomers.  As I left to take a break from ministry this is one of things that weighed heavy on my soul because for the Christian Jesus deserves better than to be intertwined with @realDonaldTrump
@danielvankirk as a devout Christian, I had the conversation many times you mentioned on @DailyZeitgeist today.  I don’t even think Pence really represents biblical values but the dude that hates foreigners, has sex with porn stars, and is a pathological liar we shouldn’t support
Hey @jonlovett I think its time to clean up who I follow on twitter.  How do you feel about showing up with these people? https://t.co/KntzXhogM1
P.S.  They hate me now.  I asked about some lies they tried to get me to say in a church setting and my eyes were opened to my own stupidity and how awful some of those people are.
Hey @milesofgray I worked with the tea party around the same time you mentioned on @DailyZeitgeist today.  Had a good friend run for US Senate.  Sorry you had to deal with those people they don’t care about the truth and love to smear and fear monger.
@RosaleeShawn Sir I am no librarian it is offensive to be called such a thing.  I hate libraries and facts.  знать свою роль и закрывать рот
@milesofgray @BoardGameBrawl @DailyZeitgeist @DivaLaci @jack_obrien @DNC I think @Trevornoah just handled it just repeat what he said verbatim.  https://t.co/lbzsXR4yPZ
@RosaleeShawn @realDonaldTrump @sabine_durden @mamendoza480 @real_jamielshaw Dang @realDonaldTrump looks like @GovernmentRF is letting you know what’s up via bots.  Be careful man.
@hamburgerphone I did the same thing the other night... but I confided in a @DennysDiner waitress while some Elvis played on repeat.
@milesofgray @BoardGameBrawl @DailyZeitgeist @DivaLaci @jack_obrien @DNC I wouldn’t risk it dude... just tow the line and say your lines.  I don’t you want you to mess up that secret society spot you are looking at.  I hear when the secret society meets they get secret stuff that aren’t on restaurant menus... don’t mess this up for us #DeepState
@MarkWarner I don’t believe you.  If treason isn’t a red line I think you all like the political theatre.
@PreetBharara That dude will lose his job at @verizon that he will go to once he’s secured their monopoly chances.  A fine line he has to walk hate it for him wish he had time for some improv classes because fhe xxl coffee mug isn’t funny.
RT @PreetBharara: It's a serious question. Check the record -- Sessions? Pompeo? Not.
RT @PreetBharara: Does anyone know who in our government cares about preventing Russian interference in the next election? Anyone?
@BoardGameBrawl @DailyZeitgeist @DivaLaci @jack_obrien @milesofgray @DNC I was just hoping they would admit to being on the take so I could try to figure out how to make money the same way.  Btw I am going to his hobby store in my home town to try out some board games next week.  Never done this before any suggestions of favorite game?
@BoardGameBrawl @DailyZeitgeist @DivaLaci Is this what you’re taking about?  https://t.co/3q94oXyvSl
@BoardGameBrawl @DailyZeitgeist @DivaLaci Are you saying that it was an intentional slight?  Thinking that @jack_obrien and @milesofgray getting some under the table money from @DNC ?
Hey @RepDeSantis did you know most of your Twitter traction is from Russian bots?  It’s why you ended up on my feed.  I wish that @CNN or @ProPublica would break this news to politicians like you and @realDonaldTrump
Hey @LouDobbs some of them said you have a drinking problem.  @realDonaldTrump I think said it first.  Is that true?  Does @FoxNews know?  Is it the reason you say crazy stuff or does the crazy stuff drive you to drink?

@JoshuaPLagee @jacquisneal @culturekingspod @annahossnieh I think if @annahossnieh and a Baptist are in agreement, it’s worth your time to consider it.  We are either very very right or catastrophically wrong.  I am like 20% of the way back to where I was with twitter traction.  Counting on @culturekingspod to help my come back.  Ha! https://t.co/ZchjK24u28
@heysarajune You either make a ton or very little but people get your content either way.  You should be like just below Zuckerberg Facebook wealthy and I don’t have a lot of hope seeing creatives like you aren’t super rich.  I’m thinking about my plan B... selling fake Gucci bags .
@heysarajune As I’ve been trying to reinvent myself and to start a new chapter in my life I’ve held back on funny or serious content and even launching out a website because monetization is just a weird thing for internet stuff.  I might just be dumber than I thought but it seems real slanted
Hey @realDonaldTrump I think you watch too much @CNN for you to consider it fake news.  I also don’t think anyone believes anything you so since none of it is true.
@DineshDSouza Maybe its because he has access to intelligences and knows guys like @DineshDSouza @DevinNunes and places like @FoxNews are just totally fabricating everything.  Dinesh will you defend your Christian faith to me?  I am concerned for your soul.
Hey @LouiseMensch what’s up with @seanhannity being hacked with that weird form thing being what the hackers put up?  Do you know what it means?  You tend to scoop everyone these days so thought I would ask you first.
Hey @RealAlexJones I think you are the most interesting crazy manipulative liar since Marjoe Gortman.  Can you tell me about some more conspiracies?  Can we hang out?  Would love to be around someone as charismatic as you.
Everyone should remember that Alex Jones @infowars said openly he is an entertainer in character in open court under oath to try to keep his kids.  Think about that as you see @FoxNews pick up his insane “news”.  May God open up the eyes of believers to seek the truth not FoxNews
I like @culturekingspod because I am also a lover of the NBA.  I worship Kings Jesus and MJ, but I agree that the Sonics in 96’ that won 69 games were amazing.  I made my parents get me some Kemps... probably the ugliest shoes I ever owned. Btw, remember lil’ penny?
Also, dont get all enthralled with some insane subculture like russian bots and trolls.  Don’t follow thousands of them to see what happens.  Spoiler on russian bot addiction: you end up even more confused AND people think you are part of @GovernmentRF as well.  Great work guys!
enjoyed this week’s episode of @culturekingspod .  I will give you some twitter advise @jacquisneal don’t neglect your real twitter account in favor of a silly parody account.  My real account used to have crazy metrics for a pastor, but neglect for a few months you’re done son!
I wonder if anyone is going to tell @seanhannity that like 90 percent of the people that commented on on most recent stupid state are bots or trolls.  Someone at @FoxNews should tell him
@hamburgerphone Also consider; a Saudi Prince, Russian Troll, male phone sex operator, incarcerated serial killer and whoever writes jokes for @GovMikeHuckabee .  I think all of these professions could be better than Drummers and Magicians.
@hamburgerphone Drummers??? With all due respect Miss Hamburger Phone, you have bad taste in men.  Here are some types of people I think you should consider over drummer or magic:  Clown, Mime, Fake Mickey Mouse at Times Square, a prop comic like Carrot Top, disgraced politician, or priest.
Hey @hamburgerphone have you ever really been on a date with a magician?  I feel like even the best of them would constantly be doing little magic tricks the entire date and would make me violently angry.
Just in case you refuse to click here’s a lil’ taste https://t.co/yVcjJWHwBY

@missychrisp @BaileyForAG Hey @TwitterSupport this is yet another bot account
With that being said... send me an invite and some plane tickets so i can attend your party.  I can bring my cassette deck with some great church tunes on it for everyone to enjoy.
Really enjoyed @culturekingspod .  Growing up I was usually the only white dude invited to one of my best friends Family cookouts/BBQ’s... it was a sacred honor that many other jealous people tried to ruin.  Seriously was the best event of my year growing up.
Let’s say someone helped the @GOP and @TeaPartyExpress for a while but has had a complete change of heart and wants to help others.  What would @jonlovett @danpfeiffer @crookedmedia @PodSaveAmerica suggest?  I seriously want to help but don’t know how to start.
He’s an outlier but there are more outliers than you would think.  All because of smoking weed because it helps for some reason to relieve the pain from a tree crushing his face.  You liberals need to get the Supreme Court smoking up so they can rule on this situation nationwide.
He stayed clean for a year so this doctor could take him back.  You know what he replaced the weed with?  Pain Patch, Opiates, and Xanax... and he says none of it helps him much anyway so he has to constantly tinker with his dosing.
Dude went to the hospital with the flu for some odd reason he got drug tested showed a failure and against th protest of his doctor, one of the largest physicians network in my state insisted the patient be dismissed.  Because of weed.
So many of the best groups of doctors at least in the south have a rule if you fail a drug test, you can’t be their patient any longer.  True story... patient had a tree crush his face years ago only thing that helped the pain is weed.
Here’s a weed problem you weed addicts at @DailyZeitgeist like @milesofgray haven’t considered as you endorse weed.  Most physicians that are part of large networks use standard patient/doctor relationship agreements and are guided by state authored templates.
Also, @DailyZeitgeist is the first podcast that has kept my attention on a daily basis... so thanks to you and @milesofgray for letting me try out my lame twitter comedy from time to time.  But just remember; not looking at diaper fetish stuff on your phone extends its life.
Also apples taste like garbage compared to Japanese pears.  And maybe your phone broke because all of life hack research regarding various uses of diapers has put you on a watch list and you had a bunch of government agencies monitoring you at once.
Kobe poetry lovers of the world will unite to show you the error of your ways.  I just have to go find the rest of these people I am pretty sure share a love fo Kobe Poetry.  If they are there we are going to troll you Russia style.  Jerk.
Hey @jack_obrien you got lucky pissing off baby boomers.  You might even get by dissing them AGAIN today on your podcast... might even be ok you junk talked Apple lovers.  But you crossed a line when you insulted Kobe’s poetry.  His poetry is beautiful and Gospel perfect.
Bonus question.  Are you a Christian and why and how does covering for @realDonaldTrump exemplify your faith?
Final question you will all be too cowardice to answer.  Do you think that you are too entangled in politics?  Do you regret it?  Do you think being closely tied with @realDonaldTrump bolsters your Gospel credibility to those that need Jesus?
Do you feel like @GOP is akin to the majesty of Jesus or better?  Be honest.  Its ok to repent and say you were wrong, I would have great respect for you to turn from defending liars.  How about any @IMB_SBC employee.
Question 3 @FRCdc and for @jonathanfalwell and @LibertyU .  Tell me about why you will feel proud when you stand before King Jesus when it comes to your support of trump.
Also @GOP feel free to give an evangelical used to be proud republican answer.  I want specific Biblical values to  the big picture of defending an adulterer and a liar.  And why lying yourself is ok.  @PressSec and @GovMikeHuckabee you false prophets answer too please.
Question 2 @FRCdc Can you state your missional or Christological positional regarding your support for @realDonaldTrump ?  Sanctity of life isn’t a valid answer because the ends don’t justify the means and Jesus would call you a brood of vipers with that answer.
1: when did you give @realDonaldTrump a mulligan?  What does that mean? Please state your biblical position regarding this mulligan.  Salvation and repentance and God giving us a mulligan is not accurate, so don’t be trite.
If you decide not to answer my questions like @ERLC I will personally make sure none of my friends even remotely consider giving to your organization.  I assure you I can cost you millions if you refuse to publicly answer my questions.
Hey @tperkins and @FRCdc I thought about it and I have given you guys tons of money and lead churches to give to you people, I feel like you should publicly answer some of my questions.
Hey @tperkins when did you give @realDonaldTrump a do-over?  When he did that porn star?
@GOP Can I publicly discuss with any leader in the @GOP regarding Biblical values?  Doesn’t seem like you guys have any values remotely close to what the Bible would indicate.
@mamendoza480 Are you aware this is not a real press release?

This memo things is a four page letter from @DevinNunes Who was supposed to recuse himself from all these matters because of treason.  What’s up @SpeakerRyan you just coasting and going along with international criminals until your time is up?
@RepSanfordSC Release that memo when you address how you and @RepMarkMeadows possibly launder money with @GOP and when you release info to the public about @NRA and @GovernmentRF ties.  You should repent of lies and turn to Jesus.
Hey @RepMarkMeadows I think how you @ncgop @GOP guys funnel money through churches and then action leagues is probably money laundering.  Wondering if you could stop obstructing the special counsel for a minute to address how you possibly launder money to @WLOS_13
Words cannot express how ashamed I am of fellow Christians at @LibertyU for allowing @DineshDSouza who is not a believe to blatantly lie to peddle propaganda.  So very sad others that are @LibertyUDiv @LibertyUAlum won’t insist leadership only bring in Christian speakers. https://t.co/tV8phRodKc

Hey @realDonaldTrump can you address the nasty rumors about you and @StormyDaniels ?  I know there is no way you could be fit enough to sleep with a porn star can you set the record straight please? Lil’ hands means other lil’ things.
@PreetBharara I think @PreetBharara and @Comey are colluding with justice to undermine @realDonaldTrump
Also @elenimitzali have you or anyone on your staff ever gone on a date with Aziz before?  Do you guys have his personal cell phone number?  Did you guys have it before?  Can you tell us more about the circumstances that led you to seek to write this story?
@CodyMorley @k80way she own an Olympus stylus camera?  Or contax t3 camera?  Something is strange about this piece. I am all for the movement and usually just stay quiet if I disagree, but this reporting seemed to have the goal of embarrassing Ansari and giving @k80way some attention @elenimitzali
That their “grace” is one of them or a friend.  That dude did some weird stuff but I think this type of reporting ultimately hinders a good movement because it doesn’t seem to me to be responsible journalism.
Hey @TVAshleigh and @CrimeJusticeHLN .   This babes dot net that published the Aziz story... do you know it’s history who funds it or any of the previous work done by editor @elenimitzali ?  If I were to take a wild guess I would say there is a good chance
Is this story about you Eleni?  I hope you get zero coverage from the likes of @CNN until you can show some credibility or responsibility.  Also who are your lawyers?  They are ok with libel?
Hey @elenimitzali and @k80way I am just going to start asking questions and maybe others will follow suit... can you say if Grace works for babe or @TheTab ?  Has she ever worked for you guys?  Why did you seek her out?  Did you already know her?
@elenimitzali @babedotnet I am still wondering if can have a dialogue about your reporting.  Is this you?  https://t.co/5w5149gGPr
Does it matter that the editor of babes dot net is this person?  I think this is a silly piece.  Eleni is not the first person to go through a difficult educational experience... seems very sensationalized.  https://t.co/5w5149gGPr
@DOB_INC This was a great episode!  How come you guys never talks about @jack_obrien wearing diapers on his back when you guys worked together?  Was he open about his family’s diaper stuff with you all?
Hey @jack_obrien @milesofgray @DailyZeitgeist I wanted to give you guys a heads up on an email you will be getting shortly.  You can totally trust your baptist boy over here as well as starcrest of California.... Seems like an incredibly legitimate operation over there. https://t.co/Ly0alXBQBb
I wonder the same thing @DailyZeitgeist in how that website that is obviously not a major news organization got such a scoop regarding Aziz.  Seems like a real newspaper, even a local one, would cover it even if the lady wanted to remain anonymous.
Side note; is it weird that Trump eats burgers in the same type of place a dossier indicates he wants Russians to go the bathroom?
Also as my post ministry life leads me near healthcare... I can tell you with certainty @realDonaldTrump does not have a good calcium scoring test.  Given his age, his McDonald’s in bed thing, and his weight, I put money on some serious build up in those arteries.
Hey @DailyZeitgeist this is what @realDonaldTrump should submit to:  https://t.co/HXW0Gw5OIR
@DineshDSouza I think they get a pass.  They give you a pass and you repost Nazi propaganda often.
@DailyCaller Isn’t this a Nazi newspaper?
@DineshDSouza Hey @DineshDSouza the daily caller is a Nazi newspaper
@MonicaLewinsky You went through a ton @MonicaLewinsky I went through something on a local level of having my name thrown into stuff involving powerful people and there was a time when I never wanted to go out in public again.  Being bold like you are is truly admirable.
Hey @Wendys I went to @McDonalds yesterday for breakfast and they charged me twice through their app.  Will you have my back in going over there to try to get my money back?
Pretty sure I basically ruined this account when I decided to only interaction with trolls and bots for 6 months.  Anyone know any way to delete everyone I follow at once to start over?  @CNET do you guys have a suggestion?  @TwitterSupport ?
Hey @AlexSchmidty you were awesome on @DailyZeitgeist as usual.  Can you give any updates on @cracked and future video content?
@milesofgray @leresatee @DailyZeitgeist I’m free any time you guys want a redneck that isn’t very funny or engaging on your show.  Just hit me up.
@DailyZeitgeist @leresatee Go ahead and post that podcast... I need to know how to feel about this stuff with Aziz... it genuinely upset me on a number of levels.  Is https://t.co/g7Q4kjruWs a legit news organization?  Have you looked at the site?
Let me know if you are willing to respond before post any questions.
I want to have a dialogue and I am going to try real hard not to ask loaded questions... I am genuinely inquisitive about some of this stuff.  If I am wrong about my negative assumptions about @k80way and your site, I promise I will apologize and make it clear I was wrong.
@babedotnet will your “organization” and @k80way allow me to ask some questions about your article about Ansari, your credentials as journalists in general and about future reporting from you all?  I will just tweet them to you guys if you are willing to answer.
@k80way @CBSThisMorning You look real happy to share your poorly sourced piece.  I hope you and your opinion website get the attention you seem to be craving.  I will get harassed for questioning you I am sure, and to be clear I think a lot of stuff described in the piece is weird and not ok.
I am wondering if anyone has ever heard of @k80way or https://t.co/qWqfrz7Hfq.  Take a moment to read the rest of the pieces not about Aziz.  Some of it is parody, the rest poorly sourced stuff... who are these people and have they written anything else of note?
I wonder if Dumb @DineshDSouza realizes that, just like @realDonaldTrump , most of your twitter followers and mentions are not real American people, but rather trolls and bots.  Come on Dumb Dinesh just be a conduit of misinformation.  Is your deceit intentional?
@SenTomCotton @FaceTheNation I don’t want to watch you on @facethenation but i do want to watch you face the music and face the court system regarding the possibility of you accepting laundered money for your campaigns.  I also think you might have committed treason with @realDonaldTrump and his team.
@milesofgray @DailyZeitgeist My wife says what would really make Bannon attractive is if he would see the error of his way and join the black lives matter movement.  Something about a beautiful heart trumps sloppy looks.  Thinking she is going to leave me for Bannon or a hunchback or Notre Dame type.
@DineshDSouza Yo @DineshDSouza you prey on poor Christian people.  Will you address the fact you are a crook or just stick with your @FoxNews @inforwars propaganda?
RT @PreetBharara: I have a patriot's faith that America is the best country. For me, this is informed by evidence (and my parents' trek fro…
@GOP You guys with the @GOP are just going to age out of being a viable party sooner than I thought.  No one under 50 buys your garbage about @realDonaldTrump doing well this year.  If you think its true factually, then lets have a dialogue.  Covering for criminals makes you complicit
As a Bible Scholar and former pastor, I would love to have a dialogue with you in some public way.  You can turn it into a money thing and have your people ready to watch you totally shame the progressive pastor with your skillz of oratory.  Let me know, I would love to talk.
The right and upstanding thing for you to do @DineshDSouza would be say that while you still support the policies of the president, such statements are just not acceptable, and you can leverage your position to coast the @GOP into a better place than it is right now.
I’ve personally watched you completely suck at a ton of debates so I didn’t like you for the piss poor way you represented my faith to the world in your weak debates way before I definitely don’t care for you because you would say anything to pander to your base.
Shithole #1: @DineshDSouza ‘s soul:  it is a stanky filthy mess where there is no Holy Spirit present	Shithole #2: @FoxNews 	Shithole #3: @GovMikeHuckabee and his daughter @PressSec 		Because you have a large following you think you don’t have to engage with me dude...
Oh how i wish @DineshDSouza were a Christian man that is remotely discerning.  @BarackObama kept it classy and  commanded a level of respect because he was a dignified leader.  Bush was too on a level.  Since you used profanity I am going to list out some shitholes for you:
@jay_alexander_ @milesofgray @DailyZeitgeist This guy should win your spinners in your contest @milesofgray .
@milesofgray @DailyZeitgeist  https://t.co/sKSsa4IhPI
@realDonaldTrump Your ambien is setting in lil hands @realDonaldTrump someone in the @GOP should have you go to sleep.
I think executive time is like slang for @realDonaldTrump needing a good amount of time to take a dump.  It sounds like code word for sex time but no one will go near him so it can’t be that.   @DailyZeitgeist
@culturekingspod This was a great debut!  You guys are hilarious!
Also @SpeakerRyan @NancyPelosi you should go in together to say you all will take extra time in your days to analyze the folks that interact with you and actively block the ones that are bots from @GovernmentRF or other places.  Lead the way in taking back space for dialogue.
I have an idea for @gop @DNC @realDonaldTrump @FoxNews @SenSanders @FoxNews  @CNN you should take a few months and examine your interactions on social media, have your staff do some clicking and when you see a bogus account or a bot even if it’s nice about your stuff, block it.
@marchio_j @TGowdySC Hey @TGowdySC you know what you and @SCGOP and @GOP could do to give hope to disenfranchised voters?  Look at tweets like this one I reply to, have your people check it out, realize it’s a bogus account and then block it.  Clean up social media for actual discourse.
@TGowdySC Hey @TGowdySC why do they keep your money laundering secrets?  Not just you being compromised by Russia but the ways you have laundered money through non profit organizations and lied to Christian people?   @FBI must like you on some level don’t mess that up.
Remember guys and @SCGOP your time is up and men of the pastorate are going to actively stand up for the truth and to actively reject those that lie or are complicit in lies.  The Mercer’s money won’t be helpful if Christian people open their eyes to your shameful lies.
To lie and to suggest a man that is greatly respected as a spy should be prosecuted is a freakin joke and it’s dangerous territory.  @SenJohnMcCain seemed to think Steele was reputable.
If you really loved the country and were good patriots, why not let the investigation play out, and let the facts speak?  If nothing illegal you proudly say nothing happened.  If something happened you can still rest well knowing you did the right thing.
Shame on you both for acting conservative and tricking people of faith into thinking you have their best interests at heart.  Shame on you both for accepting Russian help for your personal campaigns and for trying to cover for what looks like it could be treasonous.
Hey @LindseyGrahamSC and @TGowdySC you guys won’t respond but if you see this tweet know it’s true.  I not only will not be voting for either one of you, but as a Republican I will be using every bit of my influence to make sure you never hold Office in SC again.
@LindseyGrahamSC Hey @LindseyGrahamSC as a Republican I have to say you really should stop engaging in these lies and false narratives about Trump and Russia.  What’s your deal?  @FoxNews giving you more time on air?  @GovMikeHuckabee showing you over to the dark side?  Or just a liar?
@WHComsDir That’s a good point mooch.  @realDonaldTrump should have kept you around instead of @PressSec .  When you gonna get a twitter handle that doesn’t imply you work for the white house?
@RealJamesWoods I am of the opinion that it is unconstitutional for insane crappy actors to use twitter.  Doesn’t really stop you from Tweeting up a storm of lunacy though.
Hey @DineshDSouza I heard on @FoxNews you are a secret liberal or something.  Can you address if you are a secret liberal?  It would describe your piss poor arguments and you appearing to be a charicature of a terrible politic hack.  Please answer r u a lib?
Hey @PressSec can you address the rumors that @realDonaldTrump  may or may not wet the bed?  I know you will ignore me but you owe it to me... several years ago I sat at a table with @GovMikeHuckabee and the Duggar dad and laughed at the dumb jokes.  Does he have pee sheets?
@realDonaldTrump @DineshDSouza @foxandfriends Why did you tag @foxandfriends in this sweet?  Doesn’t @FoxNews only hire white folks for their news?
@milesofgray The dude was probably jealous of my $20 Pumas I typically wear and took it out on the crappy air Jordan’s.
@milesofgray Man I am glad you told me they were a  version I thought I am not in the shoe game anymore I’m way too poor for that... but I always thought these were like a lesser quality and not as comfortable as other shoes I’ve had.
@milesofgray If they were like signed by Mj or something like that I would have taken care of them.  Did you ever have a pair of Penny Hardaway’s? Remember lil’ Penny?
@milesofgray I bet that stuff is fun to go to... when I went to LA my pastoral mentor twice my age said I was dressed like an old man... So he took me to Tj Maxx near our hotel.  I can’t dress well enough for a 65 year old baptist to take me to PF Chang’s let alone go to golden globes.
@ScottPresler Do you mean metaphorically like a dumpster fire?  Because if so I think @realDonaldTrump is definitely present in the dumpster fire or a presidency he has going on.
@GrizzleMeister Hating all minorities I guess does royal up to hate the majority.  So how is the weather in @moscowgov today?  Do you get paid well to interrupt dialogue on social media?  Does @TwitterSupport ever bug you?
Hey @StephenMillerAL are you still racist?  How did you make friends with @jaketapper so he would let you throw a sissy little fit to garner some attention?  So many questions bro.  Let’s bro out bro and let’s talk.
RT @washingtonpost: Fate of "dreamers" will dominate in next round of budget talks https://t.co/DKlxA1C2mk
@GrizzleMeister You’re a racist.
@1GigiSims That is one of the most hilarious covers I’ve ever seen.  I wish someone would make one of those about me.
Explain to me why @jaketapper and @CNN even try to have Stephen Miller on a show?  You knew exactly how it would go having an alt right Nazi on your show... seems like you are facilitating shenanigans now shame on you guys.
@jaketapper @mcgregor_ewan @FargoFX Why are the @goldenglobes silly @jaketapper ?  You have problems with the Hollywood Foreign Press #GoldenGlobes
I thought about think I have probably disrespected Jesus, NBA Jesus(Mj) and devout followers of both of those guys.  Is it wrong for me to let my free shoes get this dirty?  I don’t think Mj is going to give me another pair... https://t.co/114nf0KW5S
I told him I was sorry and he had a good point and that I used to wear them a lot when I would preach and that’s when he lost it and said “you wore those dirty ass shoes in God’s pulpit?  That’s disrespectful clean your shoes and take care of your stuff.
I showed him a few pictures of this event I went to a while back to get the shoes and he was real nice for a minute and then got angrier and said “I really am not sure you’re a good guy anymore I can’t believe you would do that to some J’s”
They are old and they sit in a bag in my car and so I explained to how I got them and why it was no big deal... that Michael Jordan gave them to me at a thing when they got rereleased and it was no big deal because I hadn’t paid for them No big deal.
I want some feedback from any serious sneaker people out there like @milesofgray .  I was stuck for a few days volunteering after a weather event, this dude comes up to me and says “hey man I wasn’t going to say anything because you seem nice but what’s up with your shoes?”
Some people get to exploit nepotism and go the golden globes.  Other people get to have influential relatives and have to stay home and watch the golden globes on tv while eating snack pack pudding cups. Which one are you @milesofgray ?
@Patrici15767099 Hey @TwitterSupport this is account I am replying to is a bot.  Will you investigate and shut it down?
I’m glad this issue is settled.  He’s fine.  He’s a stable genius.  @realDonaldTrump did you ever hear a stable genius need to call themselves a stable genius?  @SpeakerRyan you are allowing this to happen.  Be a man of values and provide checks and balances. https://t.co/YgiQLAGpkr
@DineshDSouza You’re a racist
Ps just in case anyone doesn’t get my lame sense of humor and starts a crusade to have me prosecuted... I don’t think my kid smokes week and that is a breathing chamber for an inhaler.  You will have to ask @milesofgray if they can be modded to smoke the drugs.
I let my two year old listen to @milesofgray @DailyZeitgeist @jack_obrien one time and I find what seem to be weed things, and an Obama gold coin.  She also says sandwiches are dumb now.  Thanks a lot jerks! https://t.co/RVu79NQjVk
I imagine he will be in jail before I ever get the chance to speak to this Patriot again.  Oh well, there’s always @GovMikeHuckabee and discussing how he has been helping @GOP launder money through churches for decades.
Not even sure which tweet made him respond from his verified account with a DM... I was just interacting and being a silly to gain some traction with the long game of a larger audience to piss off down the road.  I am so ashamed to have missed talking with this guy.
Hey @milesofgray and @crookedmedia I spent the better part of the year trolling pseudo religious people and far right embarrassments and when I finally get my moment to shine and interact in the DM’s with one of these weirdos... I blow it and don’t see the message. https://t.co/TJIR56oHtb
Hey @hamburgerphone I am not trying to be rude but I take offense to your statement that “it is no one’s god given right to do stand up or improv”.  Pop over to @GovMikeHuckabee .  I’ll wait.  I will give you the benefit of the doubt and allow for you to post a correction.
@realDonaldTrump Go back to bed lil’ buddy.  You can dream of Russian flags, your favorite Adolph or even having bigger hands.  The sky is the limit in your dreams dude.  Just give into the Ambien and go to bed and use technology for 8 hours after taking it.
Now I must lay back down so my Ambien can wear off.  Let me know if my theory is just as viable as your #fakenews propecia story.  Also, if propecia causes most men to have erectile dysfunction(look at the studies)... why not just shave your head so your nuclear button will work?
In sum, he takes Ambien when he probably needs to be treated for sleep apnea.  So he’s high before bed and before breakfast, and all the while each time he stops breathing in his sleep, the part of his brain that helps him have good judgement is being suffocated.
Additionally I am willing to bet his “doctor” who is the same guy that sold Jack weed with nothing but stems in it, probably has never heard of a sleep study or sleep apnea, which left untreated can really mess your brain up.
The stuff effects you for 8 hours even if you aren’t asleep, so if he gets up early for whatever reason, he’s still in a sense, high on a hypnotic medication.  Thus he tweets super crazy stuff just before bed and very early in the morning.
Hey @DailyZeitgeist @jack_obrien and @milesofgray here’s my medical theory of why @realDonaldTrump tweets how he does.  Ambien.  He is ambien tweeting before bed because he doesn’t like being told to go to bed within 30 minutes of taking it.
That being said, I think it just tastes like some version of pleasant piss.  But even the best tasting piss is just piss.  So give me Mello Yello instead.
Hey @milesofgray and @DailyZeitgeist please let your boy know that I spent two days driving around to gas stations buying up a rare supply of Baja blast as a fun present for a friend.
I had a big fight with a friend that @jack_obrien was not related to the nba coach.  I was passionate and called this friend a racist and that not all O’Brien’s are related.  I was wrong.  Jack your dad is awesome and a great coach! @DailyZeitgeist
As I was typing this I hear you say “ok I am going to download it” so if you start hitting me up in the dm’s asking me to wire money to a village in Russia because you’ve lost your wallet... I will assume the game hacked you
Hey @milesofgray I am hyper competitive but I don’t love @hqtrivia .  It’s not worked any time I’ve tried to play, and I am positive it’s a data mining scheme in how they monetize it.
@realDonaldTrump The fault for the a nuclear war falls to @Twitter we told you not to allow more characters per tweet... now do you see why it’s not a good idea?
Finally maybe the hilarious @IfyNwadiwe brings me in and lets me start turn @milesofgray and @jack_obrien into a Mike and Mike situation where things get real tense.... and Boom, Ify comes in to mediate and tell everyone to get along... from that point forward the leader is Ify.
Next idea is that @milesofgray could hire me as an intern and I learn how to be funny.  Huckabee funny only plays to a certain kind of crowd... and I imagine doing stand up at a cross burning would be difficult to get the crowd focused.
Idea number 1:  @jack_obrien quickly brings me on staff to help him rebound from starting a war with Baby Boomers.  Go ask @jonlovett and @crookedmedia how their war with old people has gone.
I don’t know why if this @DanScavino guy can me like social media director for the president and house why no one would allow me to be their social media manager.  I have been told I have the quick wit of @GovMikeHuckabee and I am willing to lie just like @PressSec .
P.S. I have genuinely loved all your work... except the parts that make me introspective and try to force me to face my own psychopathy... I love it a lot more when I just frame it as how everyone else is messed up.  Thank you again for the great books!
Hey @jonronson I binged your butterfly effect podcast this week it was awesome!  Also, I was publicly shamed by some influential pastors because they understood that people believe insane stories as long as you have a smattering of truth in it.
Also, this is how those guys like Alex Jones and Rush Limbaugh indoctrinate people... they don’t take time off.  Consider taking a handful of OxyContin and then just recording whatever comes to mind.  Not saying that’s what those guys do, I just don’t know its not what they do.
Hey @milesofgray can you collaborate with the rest of your circle of west coast pagans to make sure I have plenty of fresh new podcasts daily during my Holy Christian holidays?  You all can take Merry Christmas away again as long as you keep working.
@IfyNwadiwe Your comedy special was awesome!  I loved it.  In the city I live in all the racist monuments are also Pokémon Go stops.  I was the only white pastor at a gathering one time and one of the guys with me said people probably think I was there to catch a charmander.
@realDonaldTrump I wasn’t going to say anything @realDonaldTrump because since you mentioned Comey’s urological issues in that he leaks, I have to let the world know one of your in laws told me before you because POTUS that you poop your pants often. Doesn’t that make you an explosive leaker too?
@DineshDSouza I wonder if @DineshDSouza was ever serious Christian person?  Or even a person with a soul at all?  How would you dare keep posting nonsense.  You are a disgrace to members of the @GOP everywhere.  Actually, I guess you aren’t since you guys endorse pedophiles.
@ScottPresler I didn’t watch your video because I wasn’t sure if it was a extreme political propaganda or dead eyed serial killer confessing to his crimes.
Hey @DineshDSouza thanks for spreading more lies today... its exactly what all followers of Jesus should do... perpetuate political lies on Christmas.  I would say you should be ashamed, but I know you are proud of yourself.  Hope you are paid well in exchange for your integrity.
Hey @GenFlyn  I have no idea what your “No!” Is referring to.  I have never DM’d you before.  I don’t like that function, I don’t really trust it you never really know who’s hands those conversations could fall into.  Maybe Russian, Maybe FBI.  Sad you blocked me please explain. https://t.co/5f7foDNYbf
Hey @IfyNwadiwe I just bought your stand up stuff from ITunes.  I am looking forward to listening to it while friends and family members gather for Christmas and talk about how Trump is so great... No pressure, but my happiness for Christmas is riding on the quality of your stuff
@IfyNwadiwe @DailyZeitgeist @deray @milesofgray @jack_obrien That garlic dip is delicious I will concede that.  I don’t even like most dipping sauces.  There is probably something worse than sugar in the garlic dip which is why it’s so delicious.
@DailyZeitgeist @IfyNwadiwe @deray @milesofgray @jack_obrien I have thoroughly enjoyed every episode and think @milesofgray and @jack_obrien are great, but this episode was extraordinarily good.  @deray is awesome... and I also despise Papa John’s pizza with a passion.  Thanks for all the great content you guys put out!
Just as long as we can get into some of that One Wipe Charlie money like @crookedmedia  and @deray are into. https://t.co/g81q1r8rkF
That said, I would be honored to be your podcast cohost to discuss celebrity conspiracy theories from Brittney Spears to Blink182 being actual aliens to Obama being a lizard man alien.
Thanks for the podcast shoutout @milesofgray on @DailyZeitgeist !  I’ve beentrying to get into that podcast hustle ever since my “nacho average theology” pastor podcast was about as funny as one of @GovMikeHuckabee ‘s jokes.
@ScottPresler Racist neo nazi liars definitely don’t forget.  I hope you and your boys gather together in matching polos with tiki torches to go to the polls as well.  It would be a nice touch to vote for other racists to just openly have a clan style march.
@DineshDSouza If people have to listen to an ass an dumb as you, we should probably listen to all asses.  Repent of your lies and turn to Jesus.  Also, learn to make a better argument.  You are an embarrassment to trolls everywhere.
@milesofgray just ignore that tweet on my verified account that says “yesss I made contact with a California liberal so I can make him look bad. “. I promise it’s another California liberal I am trying to shame to get street cred with fellow baptists.
@milesofgray It opened my eyes up to the reality of insane tea party politics.   The most interesting part though is just how weird Huckabee and Duggar are though.... Not just politically weird... just creepy and odd. Huckabee was doing his terrible jokes and Duggar was laughing like crazy.
@milesofgray Lol nah I hate that dude and it would prove no actual point.  Long story short I was involved in conservative politics and went to a fundraiser dinner. I got sick to my stomach as they suggested pastors lie from their pulpits and they told me the ends justify the means...
@DailyZeitgeist I hope you guys give a shout out to this fine gentleman.  If you look him up you will find he really seriously loves reposting that white nationalist frog meme and he finds infowars to be a legit organization.  You will never succeed if you don’t pander to nazis. https://t.co/F1qWDcMJPQ
@milesofgray also if you ever want to do a weird but interesting story I have one with two working titles.  “The time I sat with Mike Huckabee and the Duggar Family at a dinner” or “the last day I ever got involved in politics”.  It’s a fun story to me at least!  Ha!
@milesofgray Seeing my second favorite player to MJ get honored like that makes me feel old.  As a conservative baptist pastor I can’t admit how much I love your podcast and keep my job, but you guys have the best podcast around!
@Acosta leave @potus alone he’s broke and therefore the bill will hurt him.
Hey @acosta leave @realdonaldtrump alone the reason the tax will will cost him is because he’s broke.  Leave the poor man alone. @cnn
@ScottPresler Nothing at all wrong with being sad during a loss bro.  Makes me respect you more than you are willing to discuss it publicly.  Maybe we should stop once every few weeks, leave politics aside, and talk about how cool dogs and cats are.  We can make it a podcast :)
@ScottPresler Sorry to hear that.  I troll you fairly often, but I know from experience how pets become part of the family, and how hard it has been in my life when I’ve lost pets.  Again, sorry to hear that you will be in my thoughts.
@Scavino45 @POTUS @realDonaldTrump You should stick with being a golf caddy or posting alt-right Nazi memes... trying to convince me a tax cut for @realDonaldTrump and an increase for my kids is best for our country?  Not your strong suit. Get back to helping Donald cheat at golf.
@AjitPaiFCC are you aware that The Daily Caller is a racist almost white supremacist website?  If you are ending net neutrality at least ban the nazis.  And... your skits are dumb and your prop comedy is worse than Carrot Top.
@milesofgray That is awesome I specifically went looking today to see if you found the zune users!  They all have my utmost respect.
@DineshDSouza @SenGillibrand Hey @DineshDSouza how’s it working out for you being a money laundering fake Christian that supports guys like @realDonaldTrump that sexually assault women?  Sleep well and night?  Let’s debate publicly how you can reconcile this with your Christian faith.  DM me we can plan.
@DineshDSouza When did you stop even trying to be a christian?
@DineshDSouza That’s not true bro.  Repent and turn to Jesus.  Be born again and stop living in the cess pit of lies.
@DineshDSouza If by them you mean the people that don’t launder money from @GovernmentRF and sexually assault women... it’s because YOU are a fake Christian that should repent and seek Jesus.
@Project_Veritas @chucktodd You should worry less about @chucktodd and more on getting your undercover people some acting lessons.  Alternatively, you should consider repenting of your lies and for taking advantage of Christian people, and find a new hobby.
@CoachMrG @MariBoling @DineshDSouza @washingtonpost @FoxNews I would like to say @CoachMrG is wrong and that every dude that has an audience that claims to be a Christian is a solid Jesus follower... but fact is @DineshDSouza just isn’t.  He preys off what he knows you want ot be true and exploits your fears.
@CoachMrG @MariBoling @DineshDSouza @washingtonpost @FoxNews I have known @DineshDSouza since I met him after a debate he had on the campus of UNC over a decade ago.  Interacted with him several times since... he doesn’t have any Christian values whatsoever.... unless love of money and lying to make money is a Christian value
@DineshDSouza @washingtonpost You just make stuff up and act as an arm of @FoxNews  You prey on Christian people and profit while you know barely anything about faith and cannot articulate your own conversion experience.  You should repent and seek to spread the truth.
@DineshDSouza You are an embarrassment to the christian faith.  I hope the @washingtonpost or someone will look into you and @GovMikeHuckabee criminal ways ad how you defraud churches and Christian colleges.  You are a thief and I can prove it.
@WildlingJay @Mary22522337 @GeekTunes @RealJamesWoods @SarahHuckabee I think @Twitter  is predominately filled up with troll and bot responses now about American Politics and @realDonaldTrump .  It must be profitable or the perfect scheme since @TwitterSupport doesn’t do anything to fix it.
@RealJamesWoods @SarahHuckabee HAHAHAHAHAHAHA @RealJamesWoods you’ve finally found your niche... ridiculous humor.  That was a good one. You and @GovMikeHuckabee should team up and go on the road with your comedic stylings... it would be a bigger hit than your acting career for sure.
@GovMikeHuckabee @NFL @dallascowboys You’re a racist.  You should repent turn yourself in to the @CIA and just stop all the lies and crazy talk.  Send me a PM I will tell you who I am maybe we can talk and I can help you.  I will pay though, don’t want Russian money buying me anything.
@GovMikeHuckabee @rightwinger203 @TBN @StacyOnTheRight @michaelfarris @AllianceDefends Do you talk about Jesus in here?  The jesus that tells men of God to stand for the truth and to do everything they can to bring glory to god for the sake of the gospel?  Oh, that doesn’t match up with your @FoxNews style idolatry framework i bet.
@GovMikeHuckabee @realDonaldTrump I wish @ProPublica or @nytimes would investigate how @GovMikeHuckabee helps teach pastors how to launder money for @GOP causes “for the good of the gospel”.  He and the Duggar family have been doing it for years and just in my states it was millions funneled in cash.
@GovMikeHuckabee @realDonaldTrump @Twitter No one gets your “jokes” @GovMikeHuckabee you are not gifted at anything comedy related.  Stick to misleading Christians with your lies and sinful behavior and with working with Child molesting Duggar family in teaching pastors how to launder money for @GOP
@GovMikeHuckabee @realDonaldTrump Polling results don’t necessarily paint a picture of problems @GovMikeHuckabee   @realDonaldTrump has very small hands.  You are a man that has lost any passion for Gospel Centered trust for the idol of the @GOP and so you can be on @FoxNews Sad.
@GovMikeHuckabee I want to know if you were laundering money through churches in Arkansas and if any @SBCLIFE folks would ask you about filtering money for political causes through churches.  You taught me how to do it first hand.  Does the movie cover the money laundering?
@GovMikeHuckabee @POTUS Hey Gov are you still laundering money through churches?  Does the @FBI know you launder money through churches for @GOP projects?  Also they should investigate your jokes they are still more painful than a gunshot.
@IngrahamAngle @realDonaldTrump I don’t need the book you’re pimping.  He’s so transformative because he’s making it ok to be openly racist again.  And he is working for Russia and helping child molesters get into office.  You are also guilty hope you are proud.
@charliekirk11 @DonaldJTrumpJr @EricTrump @seanhannity You guys are nazis or something.  Actually you are probably just trying to make a buck and gather some followers.  @seanhannity  is the sexual assaulter that is the racist that mimics infowars
@charliekirk11 Also, you are apparently taking up for @MooreSenate who seems like he is a child molester.  If you help to deflect from the crime I think you are complicit in the crime.  Sleep well knowing you enable child molesters to continue to do whatever they do these days.
@charliekirk11 Why haven’t you asked for @realDonaldTrump to resign amidst all his child trafficking and sexual assault allegations and admission of grabbing women’s genitals?  Franken was wrong but has willingly submitted to an investigation.
Hey @IngrahamAngle Do you just compared @realDonaldTrump @POTUS to Charles Manson?  That was a terrible thing for you to do you need to explain yourself to me and the @GOP .  Your attempt at a cutesy statement did not go well today.
Ok just between me and you and totally off the record @DonaldJTrumpJr , you and your whole family totally worked with the Russians to sway the election right?  Don’t worry, this is off the record I won’t tell anyone.
@DonaldJTrumpJr Also I bet the apple doesn’t grab far from the tree huh @DonaldJTrumpJr ?  You like to grab you some too I bet.
@DonaldJTrumpJr I am not sure you make any sense.  Can you try again?
@_GuardianAngel8 @DanaJo114 @ScottPresler @realDonaldTrump I don’t know how to act like a parrot, 	I am not colorful and dont make Ike noises.  Are you a bot too?
If @DineshDSouza loves debating so much he should debate me.  We can get some of your money laundering friends like @GovMikeHuckabee to donate because we know the only reason you do anything is for the $$$.
@ScottPresler #CountChocula
RT @PreetBharara: "I should have left them in jail!" This is the man who pardoned Sheriff Joe Arpaio. I bet Sheriff Joe's thank you to POTU…
@BillOReilly @joelpollak Too bad they couldn’t get rapists like you off of @FoxNews I’m sad @WeAreSinclair will let people like you speak to millions.  You are sick and need help.  @seanhannity and @rushlimbaugh all love to fear monger and lie while sexually assaulting anyone you can.
Sad to me that guys like @DineshDSouza prey on Christian people by exploiting their fears.  Real Christian leaders use their platform to speak gospel truth.  Shame on you Dinesh and shame on @GovMikeHuckabee and the rest of you fake Christians that worship @GOP
@DineshDSouza @jan_applegate @realDonaldTrump Hey @DineshDSouza are you aware you are retweeting a white nationalist website?  Are you a follower of Jesus?  If so you should stop perpetuating so many lies.
@TomFitton @bcolbert68 @realDonaldTrump @JudicialWatch I am pretty sure you just made up a bunch of stuff and put up your #ClickBait link.

@ScottPresler Are you a real person?  You look at act like the love child of Vladimir Putin and Count Dracula.  Don’t forget how @realDonaldTrump wanted the death penalty for innocent black men in nyc. #troll
In case anyone was wondering @seanhannity is not a man of faith.  He really likes to be a fear mongering political hack though.  Christian people should seek a more dignified commentator.  Same thing applies to @GovMikeHuckabee
This is how @realDonaldTrump keeps it classy!  Way to go @Cabinet @RepTomRice @rushlimbaugh @PaulManafort I know all you guys sleep well at night knowing we lead the world with great dignity and poise. https://t.co/dqbaGezfSi
@submergingmkt @hootinani @nikkihaley Mostly chemical weapons though.  And mostly from  @GovernmentRF ain’t that right @realDonaldTrump ? Its ok to admit it at this point you folks complicit in treason look like you will get away with it all without consequence.
@hootinani @nikkihaley @submergingmkt No.  @realDonaldTrump and Putin discussed it while picking out their matching outfits the other night.  They think it would harm their romance of collusion to enforce sanctions.  Bffs are cute.
@nikkihaley @Scavino45 So Nikki, are you allowed to have that stance when it’s proven conclusively that @GovernmentRF provides those weapons?  @nikkihaley 2020.
@realDonaldTrump @Scavino45 @WhiteHouse Hey @DanScavino looks like you are really helping @realDonaldTrump and his image.  I didn’t see him attempt to grab or sexually assault anyone in that one minute video.  String a few of those together and he’s gone an hour without breaking the law!
@DonRondel @DanScavino @Twitter I hope this works out for you guys 99% of the people on Twitter don’t want to hear @realDonaldTrump lunacy.  You know who can’t help you with this?  @DanScavino he knows nothing about social media!
@TheresaMechele @POTUS Do you have the back of @realDonaldTrump in his actively working with @GovernmentRF to get elected?  Do you have his back with the dossier and pee pee tape?
@TheresaMechele @POTUS I am thinking these two guys are closer.... with the matching outfits and all. https://t.co/VCfIlv18Bm
Hey @replouiegohmert I was thinking with all of this work you are doing to see that justice is not done regarding @realDonaldTrump and @GovernmentRF , that maybe you just havent read the tax bill.  I read it.  It definitely only helps rich people.  Any comment?
@replouiegohmert @MorningsMaria @FoxBusiness Since you are definitely complicit in collusion/treason by trying to obstruct justice for political reasons, I think you should step up your propaganda news interview game.  @RT_com would love to have you, and @realDonaldTrump has their number.
Hey @replouiegohmert what’s up with you trying to end the investigation of @realDonaldTrump ?  Don’t you care about the truth?  BTW your charts are dumb.  We need real Christian Republican leaders, not ones that worship the idol of @GOP
@MorningsMaria @replouiegohmert We will stop talking about it that way @replouiegohmert if you just fix it so it doesn’t only help rich people.
@Lrihendry @realDonaldTrump Like that thing where @realDonaldTrump grabs women’s genitals or directly said he fired the director of the FBI because of Russia stuff?  I think you can’t make him seem more foolish than to just quote him directly.  What is a reputable news source to #russiantrolls ?
@AllOutOfHope @BrentBozell @Patrici15767099 @MooreSenate I don’t see where any of what you said is factually recorded in any outlet that is not Russian fake news
@realDonaldTrump Who is this Bill and why are you putting ideas into him?  Is it @BillClinton ?  @BillNye ? @BillGates ?  @billmaher ?
Hey @MBCRanburne I bet you guys are excited about the reporting of your deacons in favor of @MooreSenate .  Way to put party over principle.  I pray your church repent seek the gospel and distance yourselves from sexual assault.
@AllOutOfHope @BrentBozell @Patrici15767099 @MooreSenate 2: you just typed a bunch more inaccuracies.  IMO if you help cover up the crime you are accessory to the crime... you to me you are a child molestor since you are actively covering up one.  @MooreSenate should repent and drop out and get some help.
@AllOutOfHope @BrentBozell @Patrici15767099 @MooreSenate 1: you are a troll or bot account.
@BrentBozell @Patrici15767099 If i was 40 years younger I would not be ok with this situation either but you deflect to travesties of the past because you cannot defend the reprehensible actions of the present.  To be complicit in ignoring the crime you are an accessory to the crime.  Don’t cover for rapists.
RT @BrentBozell: SENATE HISTORY UPDATE: Liberals want to suggest Roy Moore lacks the moral fiber to sit in the Senate. But they perpetually…
@BrentBozell @Patrici15767099 still wrong to sexually assault 14 year olds, and to call them out of 10th grade math because you refused your number.  We can talk about the tragedy from the 60’s just as soon as we deal with the rapist presently running for office.  You ok with @MooreSenate raping little girls?
You guys @mashable say they trying to clean it up... but it certainly doesn’t seem experientially that they are.. I keep reporting these fake accounts to try to do my part.  @TwitterSupport can you provide stats on how many fake accounts you’ve removed this week? https://t.co/PlsemWjw6Y
@Genie115 @DHecei @ericbolling @ZarkoElDiablo @realDonaldTrump Are you a real person?
Congratulations to @ALGOP for definitively proving that conservative politicians can not only live a moral life totally apart from Jesus, but that you can look like a good religious person and be complicit with pure evil like child molestation.  Sleep well @GOP
@ImreadyMc4u you should just find a racist candidate that hates poor people that doesn’t molest little kids... I think @GovMikeHuckabee is available stuff as his attempt at being a twitter comedian has failed miserably.
@ImreadyMc4u I’m not too worried about it because its just not true and i have a reputation that would be as such... where as your guy has a long line of molest-y type behavior... so throwing a garbage rebuttal like that isn’t worrisome to me whatsoever
@Scavino45 @POTUS @realDonaldTrump @WhiteHouse Why did he come back early?  He need to throw down more smoke bombs of panic as his treason charges become more and more clear?
What kind of weird stuff do you guys do in Canada @AliVelshi ?  I always knew you people were far too nice when I would cross the border.   You libs keep messing with @GOP child molesters and you will get outed as the Canadians you truly are.
I thought @Twitter told our Government they were going to do better about #fakenews and #russiantrolls.  So @TwitterSupport why aren’t you revoking accounts of fake people when I report them?  Seems like you are just war profiteers now.
@taratmay @JimPatr53697314 @AmericanHotLips @President1Trump @TheDemocrats I didn’t realize you are a Russian troll i am sorry to have engaged you at all.  You guys are sick and are destroying access to truthful information by muddying everything with your garbage.
@taratmay @JimPatr53697314 @AmericanHotLips @President1Trump @TheDemocrats You are perpetuating a lie to say the democrats paid for this.  And “me without sin..” I have certainly never molested a child or sexually assaulted anyone, especially a minor.... so I think its important for mature adults to call out sexual assault.
@JimPatr53697314 @AmericanHotLips @President1Trump @TheDemocrats I have successfully completed your challenge.  Now give me my reward.  I want my reward to be that you stop tweeting and you go enjoy the day around @KremlinRussia_E   You’ve meddled enough in our lives and done a good job now go enjoy a break.
@JimPatr53697314 @AmericanHotLips @President1Trump @TheDemocrats I personally think he should be impeached for not proofreading his text messages, and for saying he has the best memory in the history of humanity.
@JimPatr53697314 @AmericanHotLips @President1Trump @TheDemocrats I think he could be impeached if those sexual assault allegations ever pop back up and any of them are able to go to trial....
@JimPatr53697314 @AmericanHotLips @President1Trump @TheDemocrats Accepting anything of value from a foreign entity in a presidential campaign i believe is also illegal.
@JimPatr53697314 @AmericanHotLips @President1Trump @TheDemocrats Perjury

@JimPatr53697314 @AmericanHotLips @President1Trump @TheDemocrats Treason
@trbrad62 @AmericanHotLips @tbailey5477 @TheDemocrats Did @realDonaldTrump tell you to never give up?  Never give up being unwilling to learn any news he doesn’t approve of?  What doesn’t he want you to give up?
@AmericanHotLips @AnbMiele @TheDemocrats I personally think that to be a @GovernmentRF employee and to have fake twitter accounts is a sign of a mental disorder.  That impeach approach won’t work ot get out lunatic @realDonaldTrump .  You guys have too much on @GOP so he’s fine.
Hey @FoxNews you seriously have @SebGorka on your staff?  I guess now that all of the sexual assault guys have to be shuffled around to Sinclair media, that makes plent of room for the racists and frauds.
@SebGorka @seanhannity @FoxNews Hey @FoxNews you seriously have @SebGorka on your staff?  I guess now that all of the sexual assault guys have to be shuffled around to Sinclair media, that makes plent of room for the racists and frauds.
@SebGorka @seanhannity @FoxNews I disagree.  There are many questions.  Who are you?  Your academic credentials are fake or a joke right?  How much are you paid by russia?  Also, who does it feel to be on the wrong side of history as a racist?  I have more questions but will run out of space.
@SenDeanHeller @DeanHeller @SenatorTimScott @marcorubio @SenMikeLee hey @DeanHeller  you are just simply not telling the truth.  You should be a man of faith like you claim ot be and just tell the truth that the mega donors of the party demand you pass a bill that will hurt your constituency.
I pray that good christian people all over the USA repent of following the anti-gospel of @FoxNews and that they would fall back in love with the beauty of the real Gospel, and be guided to seek and speak the truth from that foundation.
@FoxNews Also @FoxNews and @andybiggs4az its not just the democrats that think @jeffsessions lied.  I am a republican... the American kind not your russian hybrid kind though.  Repent and see that the truth will see you free.
@FoxNews @FoxNews you sadden me to put @andybiggs4az on the air and allow him to lie and to fear monger.  @gop needs to repent as a group, and get these liars in check.
@RepMattGaetz I disagree Mr. Liar.  You see @RepMattGaetz , one of the people is the president that seems to have had a lot of crime going on around him as it pertains to elections and the Russians.  DM me bro, prove you aren’t a coward lets dialogue.  Maybe you can convince me you’re right.
@RepMattGaetz Why do you propagate lies?  Are you a man of faith? Is your integrity worth anything?  Why are you covering for @realDonaldTrump  with this smoke screen of nonsense?  I don’t think anyone like @RepMattGaetz is man enough to have a real discourse on this issues.
@RepMattGaetz @seanhannity @FoxNews I caught it.  I was very embarrassed for you and for the @GOP .  You guys are all in lock step with lies and it is mind boggling.  When will a truly Conservative party rises up that is willing to put people and principle over party?
@RepMattGaetz You guys all let @GovMikeHuckabee teach you all how to launder money and I bet all of you men party before principle are really just trying to stay out of prison.  Do you guys take @Russia money like @jasoninthehouse ?  @FoxNews lies. #propaganda
@JulianAssange @DonaldJTrumpJr You know @JulianAssange thats a weird request to have @realDonaldTrump DM you.  @DonaldJTrumpJr already messages with you.  And So does @DevinNunes .
@RussellWofford Being totally honest... I think that building looks great and I definitely plan on checking it out!
@GenFlynn Did you not make enough money from working with foreign governments?  Turkey and Russia can’t help with your bills?
@GenFlynn You should be bitter they didn’t intervene before you committed treason.
@JerryFalwellJr @LibertyU @RussellWofford Who is paying for it?  @realDonaldTrump or money you have laundered through churches?
@Comey Watch out @Comey it appears like those Russian bots and trolls attack you a lot more than others.  P.S.  can you get me out of a speeding ticket?  :)
@DineshDSouza You are completely insane.  Are you blinded by the devil or possessed by an evil spirit? I suspect you are just a greedy liar.  Maybe we can debate one day... unless you are still a terrible debater.
I thought @DineshDSouza was a good Fake christian conservative. Seems like he’s a liar.  Jesus doesn’t really love liars.  The fbi doesn’t either.  You working for @GovernmentRF as well? https://t.co/qIBhjqvDT8
This is why the character limit should not have been increased on Twitter.  More space to start wars. https://t.co/d8PYhZRX6p
@FoxNews @POTUS @GOP Can you address the fact there are specific mentions of Russia in the charges?
Its time for @SpeakerRyan to make that walk of shame to the @WhiteHouse like Goldwater did to tell Nixon that enough is enough.
@realDonaldTrump You should have stuck with low level laundering like @GovMikeHuckabee does.  That way you don’t get investigated.
@realDonaldTrump Because you are the president and a clear and present danger to national security.  Scary to think what your next distraction attempt is
@kayleighmcenany You know that is a false statement right?  I assume you are just a verified troll but just in case you should read the indictment papers
@Montel_Williams @LouiseMensch @ChrisCuomo You just want publicity as well @Montel_Williams .  You should not try to get him cancelled.  Heroes like you preserve our freedoms.
Why doesn’t @CNN ask @JerryFalwellJr about how the president at @LibertyU said the n word a lot and he was reluctant to fire him?
@realDonaldTrump You sound like King Nebuchadnezzar.  I love this country but love Jesus much more. #ChristOverCountry
Must be some crazy news about @GovernmentRF and @realDonaldTrump coming down the pipeline.  He’s tweeting distractions like crazy.
@LouiseMensch Gowdy and @GovMikeHuckabee used to just launder millions through churches... now they’ve stepped up their game.
@AliceEngle3 @realDonaldTrump Of course they won’t get your money you live in @Russia and are busy helping @realDonaldTrump like to the American people.
I wonder why no one sits down to inform @realDonaldTrump that most of his Twitter Followers are @Russia bots.
Hey @realDonaldTrump the @NFLPA is protesting you and your racist friends, do you realize that?
@marclamonthill you were just on @CNN trying to reason with the unreasonable.  I pray one day there can be a dialogue and people listen.
@league2734 That story is incorrect
@realDonaldTrump Shouldn’t @RandPaul and @GOP be concerned w the good of the American people?  I know @POTUS should but we won’t go there.  You &lt;3 @Russia
@GovMikeHuckabee @ManMountain78R3 @realDonaldTrump FISA warrants aren’t illegal spying.  Remember all those times you helped @GOP launder money through churches? I do and can prove it.

@aboveknowledge @JerryFalwellJr @realDonaldTrump @LibertyU @GOP Galatians 6 would indicate I need to tell you you are sinning in your idolatry of @realDonaldTrump
@aboveknowledge @JerryFalwellJr @realDonaldTrump @LibertyU @GOP You seem like a @JerryFalwellJr style racist.  You should read the entire bible.  Also Falwell should read the Bible as well.

@aboveknowledge @JerryFalwellJr @realDonaldTrump If that’s all you’ve got... I still think you’re racist.  How often do you say the n word?
Hey @DineshDSouza are you really a Christian?  Or are you the @GovMikeHuckabee kind of believer and worship on the altar of @FoxNews ?
@DineshDSouza @AerieMoon Were you ever a Christian?  I watched you lose debates live to non Christians a few times I just thought you were dumb.  R u saved?
@Skeptical_Cynic @greeneyedbecky You are a bot or Russian troll.  This is the stuff that realDonaldTrump should condemn too.
@aboveknowledge @JerryFalwellJr @realDonaldTrump Yes.  I have problems with @JerryFalwellJr and any trustee or faculty of @LibertyU for getting caught up in @GOP politics over Jesus.
@aboveknowledge @JerryFalwellJr @realDonaldTrump You don’t seem like you are a Jesse Jackson fan.  Is @JerryFalwellJr racist?  R u racist?

@southernsp3ak @RepMarkMeadows @POTUS @realDonaldTrump We are paying for it and using he debt ceiling to force it.  Meadows should be impeached as well for this position.

@JerryFalwellJr @foxandfriends Where does @JerryFalwellJr stand regarding racism and nazis?  With @realDonaldTrump and Hitler.  Jesus isn’t on that side.
@JerryFalwellJr @foxandfriends I hope you were paid well to lie so much.  Racism is also a sin.  You should repent and be born again.
@aboveknowledge @JerryFalwellJr @realDonaldTrump I will can you tag them on here and have them tell the president didn’t say racist stuff and @JerryFalwellJr took up for him?

@ElderLansing @sandrajeanne48 People that post this stuff know it’s a lie but it doesn’t matter anymore the alt right and trolls just push it anyway.
@CBNNews @YouTube One of the best ways to better educate fellow Christians is for @CBNNews to stop broadcasting.
@alozrasT @rescuetracker81 Nope.  Can’t change that the south lost and human slavery ended.  So we shouldn’t celebrate the treasonous rebellion of racists w statues.
@pastormarkburns @aboveknowledge Yep totally forced the racist nazis to kill someone.  Repent for these statements.
@pastormarkburns @aboveknowledge Remember that time when you got caught being a liar for trump?         https://t.co/HOXt1fYdPb https://t.co/tAOAVF2mb0
@aboveknowledge @JerryFalwellJr @realDonaldTrump Absolutely honest.  Do you sympathize with white supremacy too?  R U racist?
@aboveknowledge @JerryFalwellJr @realDonaldTrump He’s defending sinful racism without being able to give a biblical reason why he thinks white supremacy is ok to condone.
I wonder how @LibertyU feels about @JerryFalwellJr tacitly endorsing white supremacy.  Are all of you nazis ornjisr Him?  @jonathanfalwell ?
@JerryFalwellJr @realDonaldTrump So the president of a Christian seminary endorses white supremacy too?
@DineshDSouza I think you a Russian traitor and an OxyContin addict should not represent conservatives at all.  Rush lies because he is high,  why do you?
@warriorgal777 @DineshDSouza @BreitbartNews I was under the impression you are a Christian Dinesh.  Was I incorrect?
@davidjeremiah Racism breaks gods heart.  Please pray about resigning @realDonaldTrump religious council to take a gospel stance against racism
@ronniefloyd Will you pray about distancing yourself from @realDonaldTrump and resigning his council?  your example would would be inspiring.  Jesusfirst
@JerryFalwellJr @LibertyU Greater news would be if you distance yourself from @realDonaldTrump and leave his council.
@DrJamesCDobson @DrJamesDobsonFT How Do you explain to kids that you endorse a president that defends nazis and white supremacists?  @GovMikeHuckabee does it with bad jokes.
@firstdallas @philwickham Phil, do you support @realDonaldTrump on the same level as @firstdallas ?  Are you worried about your credibility by being with Jeffress?
@Franklin_Graham @POTUS Shame on you for defending @realDonaldTrump can you still defend him after today?  You should repent and be ashamed.  Be a Christian first
@firstdallas Do you all have lessons on how to explain your pastor defends nazis racists and realDonaldTrump ?

@JackKingston I really wish you and @FoxNews would focus up on @POTUS being a weak stooge for @GovernmentRF .  Then to follow your money.
@realDonaldTrump you don't know me but I am sad you have stopped leading your staff and giving it over to the general.  Is it too tough?
@RogerJStoneJr Did they have hammers when they talked to you about how you assisted in an attack on our nation’s elections?
@RogerJStoneJr Is that how you see them?  That’s called a psychopathic delusion and normal for someone with the stress of being a traitor and liar.
@RogerJStoneJr If @IngrahamAngle wants to win she will not want your endorsement.  You smell like treason and crazy with malt liquor mixed in.
@RogerJStoneJr I would love to help a psycho out but I don’t know how to exchange my US dollars for Russian money.  I know that’s all you have now right?
@kiya819 @JackKingston I figured.  I pray for a day when power hungry guys like @JackKingston are replaced by men that don’t try to defend the indefensible.
@JackKingston @AC360 In my in depth research about you over the last 3 minutes makes me convinced following your money leads to @GovernmentRF .  @GaRepublicans
@JackKingston @AC360 Also as a guy that made a typo earlier tweeting at you I still think it’s important to tell you it’s “didn’t do anything”
@JackKingston @AC360 Following your money leads us to @Russia .  Can we talk about your money as well?
@kiya819 @JackKingston Devious men use that fake “southern gentleman” schtick to be underestimated and have positions of power.  Don’t let him fool you.
@JackKingston @donlemon @ChrisCuomo Dude I owe you an apology.  I just read up on you and see you’ve been building ties in Russia for a while now.  #Kompromat or #Collusion ?
@JackKingston @donlemon @ChrisCuomo Is @GOP running someone against you?  I would love to vote for someone else.  Does taking up for @POTUS fund you against primary opponents?
@JackKingston @donlemon @ChrisCuomo You ignored the @GOP strategist but it’s concerned also our elected leaders don’t know we are a republic.  Small details paint big pictures.
@JackKingston @donlemon @ChrisCuomo As a Republican I am embarrassed to hear men like you defend @realDonaldTrump and offended you can’t have discourse with fellow @GOP members
Hey @realDonaldTrump  did you know @TuckerCarlson is the hero of the kkk?  You probably did that’s why you had dinner with.  Racism is a sin
@Scaramucci Mooch you spoke on the record bro.  Only trust @GovMikeHuckabee he laundered money in churches so he will keep your secrets.
man @Scaramucci you have a real potty mouth.
@ChuckGrassley That’s why you told @realDonaldTrump to make a recess appointment.
@ChuckGrassley Why do the links to your constituents to ask questions contain tracking mechanisms?
@GrassleyPress why do your q&amp;a links have IP trackers?  Who gets the info? @IowaGOP or @GovernmentRF ?  Answer:  all of the above
@ManOfRust @GrassleyPress @ChuckGrassley His link has an IP tracker like you would expect in a scam email.  #highclassglass and his trickery.
@GrassleyPress @ChuckGrassley This is an IP tracking link.  Does @IowaGOP you with these?  It’s concerning and unethical to have a tracker embedded in a link.
Hey @GovMikeHuckabee I miss your teaching how to launder money.  I guess being a hack and a liar pays better than preaching the gospel.
@RealJamesWoods I guess being one of the worst actors ever doesn’t earn you a living wage and you have to be a Russian troll.  You def sync with @RT_com
@TGowdySC way to take up for guilty traitors.  I hope the people of @SouthCarolinaRT are happy with your actions.
@ChuckGrassley you might think all young people are lazy and amoral by you know what they frown on?  Ignoring treason.  You on the take too?
@PaulManafort Any further questions ask @GovMikeHuckabee he has been laundering money through churches 4ever but that’s played out I want your skillz bro!
@PaulManafort Don’t call me on your phone though i don’t need @BarackObama listening in. Lolz.
@PaulManafort hey man i need some advice how to hide money by buying property then getting a mortgage I heard you are the man to help.
@PaulManafort I don’t think anyone realized exactly what kind of treasonous scoundrels you and @realDonaldTrump were so they were coasting.
@PaulManafort Haha you are funny
@GenFlynn hey bro!  I’ve been missing you and your nonsense!  Did you end up moving to Russia and what??! Lolz HMU bro
@tedlieu Man it seems like @RoguePOTUSStaff doesn’t like you very much.
@realDonaldTrump Because his assignment is to look at your treason and the treason of your friends and family.
@h60usn @TrumpTrain45Pac @realDonaldTrump Nah I don’t care about a dinner meeting I mean the one at Trump Tower.  I am @GOP by the way I just want a pres that isn’t a traitor.
RT @PreetBharara: John McCain is an American hero &amp; patriot. Facing torture, insult, and political setback, he has always been America firs…
@TrumpTrain45Pac @h60usn You know what’s even sketchier?  All the lies @realDonaldTrump tells.  Very sad you trolls and bots cloud up legitimate issues.
@exjon I looked and thought someone stole my dog.  Our dogs are twinsies and equality immodest! https://t.co/3jr9uBOi4s
@realDonaldTrump I had a meeting like that one time with @GovMikeHuckabee and Jim Bob Duggar.  They wanted me to help funnel money for @GOP through churches.
@realDonaldTrump I dunno bro.  Seems like the dishonest thing was your private meeting with Putin.
@GrassleyPress can you comment on his stance on Russia and why he disagrees with intelligence agencies?  Does Russia finance his campaigns?
@RandPaul @RepMarkMeadows @realDonaldTrump Do you guys not care at all about those in need?  Just trying to keep your campaign financiers happy?
@RepMarkMeadows You still aren’t actually listening to your constituency.
@TrumpTrain45Pac @POTUS I think think this is a real account @TwitterSupport why do these bots have freedom to exist?
@mitchellvii Your statement implies you would have to compromise your values to win as a team.  Is that what you meant?
@RogerThatB17 @nanciekayreyes @RealJamesWoods @POTUS The word is persevered.  You russian bots will get it one day.  English is so nuanced don’t give up hope!
@RealJamesWoods A 20 minute meeting is 18 more minutes than you’ve been relevant in the 21st century.
@JeffFlake I wouldn’t worry about @realDonaldTrump trying to have @GOP push you out... Treason tends to remove your influence pretty fast.
@ChelseaClinton @foxandfriends I hope this is helpful and just remember @FoxNews I am available to tutor your entire staff.  Except @seanhannity he won’t listen.
@ChelseaClinton @foxandfriends Literal:  @foxandfriends is literally terrible and literally lies and literally misleads their viewers.
@ChelseaClinton @foxandfriends Hyperbole/metaphor:  a politician would sell their firstborn to be elected.  Means they would give up a lot.
@ChelseaClinton I think ae are missing a bigger problem in that @foxandfriends probably doesn’t know how to use the world literally.
@RealJamesWoods You’re just a troll trying be relevant.  I like you better as a bit player on Family Guy.
@melissacevans33 @GregBewick @notTrumpfoPrez @FoxNews @jessebwatters @DonaldJTrumpJr Agreed. We should not mistake their intentional malevolence and manipulation for being dumb... this is the master plan working out perfectly
@FoxNews @realDonaldTrump @jessebwatters @DonaldJTrumpJr .@jessebwatters lied to get your attention.  He feels bad your kids are going to jail and that all of your Twitter followers are bots.
@GregForMontana You will do a great job in removing healthcare from poor people and helping to cover up enemy infiltration into our government.
@GregForMontana I haven’t heard of any more of you assaulting the press.  Since you are funded by Russia you need to get back in form.
@SenatorBurr @MarkWarner We should see more stuff like this rather than politics always being confrontational
RT @SenatorBurr: #tbt to having some fun behind the scenes w/ DHS Under Secretary for I&amp;A David Glawe's sweet kids a few weeks ago cc @Mark…
@realDonaldTrump They said that when you came in bc they didn’t want to be caught talking about treason w/ you @DonaldJTrumpJr PaulManafort &amp; @RepDevinNunes
@realDonaldTrump You seem to care a great deal about how you are covered.  Seems to really consume you. I am here if you need to talk dear friend.
@realDonaldTrump Like when you said people told you @POTUS44 was born in Kenya?   That’s good advice because your sources were made up and did not exist.
@MaestroPaulD @JeffTutorials @realDonaldTrump You misunderstand the definition of fake news.  Fake news are the facts that @POTUS doesn’t like.  You are looking at it too logically :)
@JeffTutorials @realDonaldTrump They have nothing better to do than talk about a legitimate big deal in meeting with Russia to help them sway an election.
@realDonaldTrump I don’t trust that Bannon guy.  I think he is the @RoguePOTUSStaff account and I think he keeps telling people he is really the president.
@realDonaldTrump You were the one on the phone with @PaulManafort during the meeting huh?  Probably talked about your server being used?
@realDonaldTrump Turns out he lied to a man of impeccable character that has never lied before in  @seanhannity .  Sad your son lied to that poor man.
@realDonaldTrump I hope you still have your server that Kushner let @alfabank use to get hacked election data.
@seanhannity @realDonaldTrump Do you believe in compromise Hannity?  I think it should be both/and but you have to admit the most pressing issue is @POTUS and Russia
@seanhannity @realDonaldTrump Some of that stuff is probably a problem.  What if we just said all that and the Russia Trump treason should be looked at?
@foxandfriends @realDonaldTrump @jasoninthehouse You guys at fox make me sad.  I don’t know if you are hateful or dumb or being bullied by Trump.
@foxandfriends @realDonaldTrump @jasoninthehouse Those documents were not classified.  However factually Jason is financed by Russian shell companies.  Can we talk about that?
@foxandfriends @realDonaldTrump @jasoninthehouse Jason should wonder why the fbi director didn’t trust him to answer the question.  Because you have been compromised by the Russians?
@foxandfriends @realDonaldTrump @jasoninthehouse Jason is lying it’s obvious in his body language.  Fox propaganda machine hard at work.
@realDonaldTrump Just as soon as you face justice for treason along with your entire family we can talk about the rest.
@foxandfriends @realDonaldTrump Why did @POTUS post this from Lyin’ Ted?  Is he saying congress should go home.  @realDonaldTrump you send so many mixed messages.
@realDonaldTrump @seanhannity What country does @DonaldJTrumpJr love?  @Russia ?  He lied to @seanhannity who lies to be loyal to you.  Shouldn’t you stop tweeting?
@realDonaldTrump @WashTimes Seems like you boys are caught now and those fisa warrants to get you on tape bro.  Your pal @PaulManafort should have been a better spy.
@jasoninthehouse @realDonaldTrump Jason you still tweeting?  I thought that @GovernmentRF blackmail they had on you had you being silent.  Be bold in the face of #Kompromat
@realDonaldTrump Sorry your kids had to work with Russia to get you elected with Russia and they didn’t include you.  They told me it’s because of your hands
@realDonaldTrump Why did you even mention tv?  That’s so strange and we all know you watch @FoxNews garbage all the time
@realDonaldTrump I wouldn’t consider functioning perfectly a place where your closest associates are leaking all your business.
@GovMikeHuckabee @Morning_Joe @realDonaldTrump @morningmika @GOP I can tell how you showed us to funnel money though offerings to defunct nonprofits to get back to @GOP .  I sat with you and @duggarfam .
@GovMikeHuckabee @Morning_Joe @realDonaldTrump Governor maybe @morningmika would shift from Russia and let me explain how you helped teach pastors to launder money for @GOP initiatives?
@GovMikeHuckabee @Morning_Joe @realDonaldTrump @realDonaldTrump having treasonous kids and murderous managers like @PaulManafort is kind of a big deal.
@GovMikeHuckabee @Morning_Joe This makes me sad oh man of God that is called to herald truth.  You are participating in a cover up with nonsense.  Repent and seek Jesus!
@GovMikeHuckabee Why have you become a political hack?  You used to be a great preacher and now you lie and disgrace the gospel daily on national news.
@GovMikeHuckabee you must have more dirt on @realDonaldTrump than Putin.  Your jokes aren’t funny and your daughter is a pathological liar!
@SenateMajLdr why you covering up Russia stuff?  To get your initiatives pushed or are you like @jasoninthehouse and funded by russia?
@SenateMajLdr You tweet like a child. Your choice of emoji is odd.  Are you financed by @GovernmentRF as well and give a bot as an intern?
@SenateMajLdr Everyone did thing the president got to pick,  but it seems like your evil started that with blocking @BarackObama ‘s Supreme Court pick.
@SenateMajLdr @POTUS That’s because you ignore treason for the sake of hope of a huge tax cut paid for by killing Medicaid. Do you have a heart?
@realDonaldTrump Is it still a hoax if they have you talking to @PaulManafort on the phone during the meeting?
@marckasowitz I saw you giving out your phone number so we can discuss why you all work for @realDonaldTrump .  I would love to talk pm me.
@Wendys I think you collude with @McDonalds because you are scared job might lose to @kfc
@eavesdropann That’s #fakenews and would have nothing to do with @POTUS being a Russian puppet
@FoxNews @kimguilfoyle @POTUS I didn’t think  your reality is the same as my reality.
@RobSchneider @HerringWendy Don’t you have an @AdamSandler movie to go stand in the background of?
@PreetBharara I suspect @realDonaldTrump doesn’t understand sarcasm so please be careful not to give him false hope by taking you literally.
@PreetBharara Where there’s smoke there is absolutely no fire at all.
@PreetBharara If it looks like a Rat and smells like a rat it’s definitely fake news.
@ChelseaClinton You’re just jealous.  Next time your mom should be more willing to commit treason to win.  #gobig
Are the people of @firstdallas ok with this idolatry? https://t.co/7nJpwg8jDB
Criswell and Truett would be sad.  Jesus probably doesn’t approve either.  All member of #firstdallas should be ashamed https://t.co/T0LBI6dO14
@SenKamalaHarris You have to stop asking legitimate questions and expecting legitimate answers. You are in congress now.#loweredexpectstions
@seanhannity @pgrlegacy @GOPChairwoman @RealDrGina no they didn't
how does a snarky twitter novice get to be recognized by his heroes like @crookedmedia @jonlovett @jonfavs @deray  and the rest?
@seanhannity Aren't you the hammer in the hand of the propaganda/sexual harassment arm of the @gop aka @FoxNews ?
@seanhannity @GOPChairwoman @RealDrGina Do you think before you speak?  I would rather listen to @GovMikeHuckabee teach pastors to money launder for @GOP than hear your lies.
@seanhannity No that's crazy talk.  But you are a crazy man.  That's just an insane proposition.
Hey @SenKamalaHarris every time someone gives a dissertation to a yes/no question my default assumption is that they are unwilling to answer
@freedomcaucus @RepMarkMeadows Hey @freedomcaucus how many of you like @RepMarkMeadows helped teach churches to funnel your campaign money?
@SHSanders45 @POTUS @GOP If @Russia doesn't have #komprimat I know a lot of Baptist pastors that have some on you and @GovMikeHuckabee
@SHSanders45 @POTUS Do you remember when I met you and your dad when you were teaching pastors how to launder money for the @GOP ?
@RepMarkMeadows Most of the people retweeting you are the same bots and trolls that work for @RoguePOTUSStaff and @Russia .  That makes me sad. #yousoldout
@RepMarkMeadows If that was true you would listen to be and give me a reason avenue by which to ask questions and have a dialogue.  You are a D.C. Elite.
Hey @realDonaldTrump I find you to be a rude bully and a traitor along with @jaredkushner .  time to push @congressdotgov to impeach you.
@reverendmatty @LouiseMensch @paradexes @CORLEBRA777 @dark_wisdom_ @hardhouz13 @MrFelt_ @TrickFreee @ScottBaio I think @ScottBaio has been kompromat go easy on him.  Russians don't realize that their intel is Charles in charge and its on tv still.
Its cool @gianforte took down that reporter with that Russian body slam.  Putin should be proud he helped finance your election.  #treason
@realPOTUS_45 @JHLewis5 @RealAlexJones Are you a real person.  You don't strike me as one.
@RealAlexJones Everyone knows @nytimes is run by evil Obama aliens, ain't that right @RealAlexJones ?  Do the courts know you are back in character again?
@nikkihaley @SonnyTfoth Hey @nikkihaley what up with @jaredkushner and treason?  You ok with treason too?  They have #komprimat on you like they do @DevinNunes ?
Hey @GovMikeHuckabee part of your blackmail bc of #komprimat that you must make ignorant jokes?  Let me compromise you the jokes are BAD.
@jasoninthehouse More worried about the #kompromat that @Russia has on you @jasoninthehouse .  Worry less about @BarackObama and more about @realDonaldTrump
@TrueFactsStated @LouiseMensch I wish you libs would knock it off you know the old saying... where there's smoke there's the biggest fire hunt ever and no actual fire.
@Minions4Trump @danielmichael73 I out Russian trolls and bots so I'm probably not the kind of person you take home to mama Putin
@TexBrussow @The54Car @SouthLoneStar @BarbMuenchen What does OFFS mean?  This bot is really messing up today someone needs to update his programming.
@The54Car @TexBrussow @SouthLoneStar @BarbMuenchen They will learn about the English language as they go just be patient. It's hard to go from Russian to English.
@Vonotar @USAaboveparty @TrueFactsStated I dunno seems far fetched.  Who wouldn't think  @GovernorPerry wouldn't be the BEST pick ever for @ENERGY ?
@SouthLoneStar @BarbMuenchen This is fake news tweeted from a propaganda account.
Hey @TGowdySC does @Russia fund your campaign as well?  I wonder if a lot of @GOP and @DNC politicians aren't funded by Putin.
Glad to see @POTUS reads classy news @DRUDGE_REPORT maybe you @PaulManafort and @GovMikeHuckabee should stick with @RT_com
@ProPublica you should see if @GovMikeHuckabee was paid by Russians or just through baptist laundering.  I can explain the Baptist part.
I blame this Comey firing on @NateSilver538 His "numbers" and "Statistics" failed us on predicting this as well.  Stop with your dumb math!
@realDonaldTrump I don't think its a hoax bro.  Just ask my 3000 russian troll friends i have ever on twitter they will tell you.
@GovMikeHuckabee You speak like a folksy fool and make Baptists look bad.  @GovMikeHuckabee is on @realDonaldTrump payroll or paid by @GovernmentRF
@SenatorBurr Don't be so troubled.  It just makes room for Putin to be our FBI director.  Maybe @PaulManafort can be interim leader?
@JeffFlake Its pretty easy to find the rationale @JeffFlake .  Just ask @KremlinRussia_E
@DeeCeeCats @DrMartyFox @shootingfurfun We know have reason to be worried... Put has figured out that the best way to influence the USA.... via cat memes!
@LVNancy @DrMartyFox @GeorgiaDirtRoad @JrcheneyJohn @ConstanceQueen8 @SandraTXAS @ChristieC733 @SpecialKMB1969 @JVER1 Seems like regardless of her testimony that enough people have stated clearly that Russia greatly interfered in the election.
@LVNancy @DrMartyFox @SandraTXAS @ConstanceQueen8 @GeorgiaDirtRoad @JrcheneyJohn @PinkBelgium @JVER1 @nia4_trump @bfraser747 @ChristieC733 Both of these people are being propped up by Russia.
@CattHarmony @DrMartyFox Dr. Marty I thought you said you were Jewish?
@DrMartyFox If you are an American patriot why do you propagate Russian lies?
@DrMartyFox @shootingfurfun Do doctors that say crazy stuff while popping ambien and Percocet get that pre existing condition status?  If so you should get some help.

@jenniferpgoff @maxcua_ @jamesirving2 @risetoflyy @beck_amikebeck @InfogretchenMy @madeINTheUSA006 @InventingLee @RealJDaniels @Twitter As you can see, my mom is not very funny and doesn't put up with games.  She also says I'm really smart and cool.
@jenniferpgoff @maxcua_ @jamesirving2 @risetoflyy @beck_amikebeck @InfogretchenMy @madeINTheUSA006 @InventingLee @RealJDaniels I asked my mama.  She said you conduct cyber warfare for Russia and that @Twitter should be ashamed for not shutting you down.
@maxcua_ @jamesirving2 @risetoflyy @beck_amikebeck @InfogretchenMy @madeINTheUSA006 @InventingLee @RealJDaniels @jenniferpgoff How's it like being a Russian propaganda agent?  Do they pay you well in American money.  They don't pay you in beets do that?
@CarrieGeren @PrisonPlanetTV @infowars @InfowarsReports @RealPIW @PrisonPlanet I couldn't open it because my moral values, high standards and desire for factual news won't allow me to look at @infowars

@oleoacres45 When did you ask me that
@VinceGottalotta @TerryLambert201 @Rikkek7 @diddliest @RRMatheson @tweettruth2me Yea Trumps guys hold rallies all the time .  Alt right kkk nazi dudes mostly get along so when those racists gather it's peaceful
@CarmineZozzora @PlaysTrumpCard Is it being done? I don't believe it is.  What about nations that don't have as much money do they not get as much help?
@propornot read your site I want to help I have a bunch of bot and troll friends.  It's been fascinating but I would love go help mark them.
After interacting only with Russian bots or trolls for a few weeks I am going to need @jonronson to explain to me exactly what I encountered
@jonronson I spent the last month or so interacting solely with what I think are Russian Bots and Trolls.  Its so fascinating and confusing.
@In_TrumpWeTrust I would think a twitter rally of all the Clansmen and Russian trolls he pays with @SeinfeldTV  money should get @realDonaldTrump attention.
@In_TrumpWeTrust This is a clear example of Russian Propaganda clouding conversation.  #twitterstopthebots
@In_TrumpWeTrust What is treason or cyber warfare?  Diseases?  Intentional acts of terror?  Just how normal people act?
@In_TrumpWeTrust I saw this on the news a few times.  Might not have been on tv at your home in Russia though.
@In_TrumpWeTrust I bet those slippers sell like wild fire at clan rallies.
@MOVEFORWARDHUGE I wonder if @KellyannePolls looks at you guys and is proud of using your propaganda and distraction as a help in her work.
@keithboykin @MarkRuffalo I thought we've covered this before.  He doesn't lie.  He has alternative facts.
@FoxNews Just because you quote it doesn't make it true.
@CarrieGeren @2ALAW @clayfeathers @steph93065 @SandraTXAS @ChristieC733 @LeahR77 @TheMeemStreams @RightWingAngel @JustMy_NameHere @TheTrumpLady @HatesTwatter @1Kimsey Did your prophesies tell you about Trump and the Dossier outlining his bad behavior?
@1MaisonRouge @BB4SP @BarracudaMama That's not a true story that is foreign propaganda that should be dismissed by all Americans.  The Truth Matters
@MOVEFORWARDHUGE Was he right about his crowd sizes?  Was he right about all those other things he was wrong about?
@MOVEFORWARDHUGE @oinc2islam I used to love @gwfrazee but he stopped being my friend.  Maybe you guys can talk to him for me.
@MOVEFORWARDHUGE I am glad you actually didn't have me muted.  I feel so much better.  I love you and @oinc2islam
@MOVEFORWARDHUGE I am no mute that is a rude accusation. I thought you and i were best friends :(
@MOVEFORWARDHUGE You dum.
@FedExHelp @oinc2islam I wouldn't sweat it too much @FedExHelp getting a ham to a paid Russian operative is hard work.  They should eat at @Wendys next time.
@oinc2islam @FedEx I didn't know fedex delivered Easter ham to @GovernmentRF and early at that.  They can't get my stuff to Orlando on time.

Who pays the guys that call out Russian propaganda accounts?
@Ant_R_Salvatore @KarinanTaylor23 @DLoesch @glennbeck Wow again such a lame retort.  You need to study the comedic genius of @GovMikeHuckabee some more and then try again.

Sorry for realizing you can't change what you are.

@oreillyfactor I hope you're vacation is going well.  Sorry you got caught sexually harassing all those people.
Hey @SenSanders I think I want to try to run for office and @donnabrazile didn't write back.  How does one get started in politics?
@RoguePOTUSStaff I've spent a few days getting entrenched in these bots it's so fascinating and creepy that it's so easy to hijack all information online.
@RoguePOTUSStaff Be careful guys an army of Russian bots will begin to pound you soon if you keep implying trump works for Putin.
@seanhannity Yo @seanhannity if you are on americas side focus on Russia...your career can last longer than a lil hands presidency. Don't get bogged down
@seanhannity Trump would be proud of those silly insults that lack comedic value.
@seanhannity @DHecei @POTUS I think I question if you are just trying to make some. Only off conservative people and if you are a faker.
@MOVEFORWARDHUGE You want to try to have a dialogue about some issue? We might come out being more understanding
@MOVEFORWARDHUGE Im emotionally dead  and I only mimick the emotions of others.  A doctor called me a psychopath but what do doctors know he's #fakenews
@whiteladysake I'm no liberal my propaganda spreading friend.   You just say what you are paid to say and if you ever want to talk hit me up.
@MOVEFORWARDHUGE I don't think I know what you mean.  Is toad twitter slang too?  What does it mean?
@stadlibster4 @mitchellvii You should look at our Immigration it's incredibly rigorous.  I agree there is room for improvement though.
Hey @robertjeffress you still pretty focused on this Russian stooge I'm the White House?
@MOVEFORWARDHUGE He was trying to dumb it down using metaphors so even dumb Russian bots and trolls can understand.
@kwilli1046 @jimmyradkowski @GovMikeHuckabee lies.  They aren't coming back in another life this story is a false flag!
@glennbeck Used to think you are a psychopath but I agree on some things now.  Either I am a psychopath too or I learning to be tolerant.
@Ant_R_Salvatore @KarinanTaylor23 @DLoesch @glennbeck Snowflake is a silly bully word.  You are mad you're old and life has passed you by huh?
@stadlibster4 @mitchellvii You must not visit many third world countries.  Helping other nations wouldn't have hurt us.
@mitchellvii @Trumptbird How do we get screwed by the world?  Shouldn't we play a role in the world we live in?
@SarahPalinUSA I miss you.  This Russian propaganda treason style stuff is too much.  Come back and get involved.
@barbaefaw @MrEdTrain @gotspeed2burn They just trying to promote fake news baby it's ok
@barbaefaw @MrEdTrain @gotspeed2burn He doesn't have any unless its @seal team six https://t.co/y7gxkyz46Z
@MrEdTrain @KNP2BP Could also be like the musician and its @Seal team 6."  You propaganda people are funny.
@MrEdTrain @KNP2BP I see what you did there you almost had me.  You said seals team 6.  Likes the animals. https://t.co/T9cEtgCn0g
@MrEdTrain @KNP2BP Who told you that?
@ChipHinkleman @GovMikeHuckabee I'm also not sure @GovMikeHuckabee is tweeting out multifaceted multilayered jokes.... so I get the jokes.  They aren't funny though.
@ChipHinkleman @GovMikeHuckabee I have considered that possibility and then came to the conclusion that @GovMikeHuckabee being funny just isn't a possibility.
@donnabrazile I want to do my part and get involved in politics.  You said on @TheDailyShow to write you so I didn't and you didn't respond at all :(
@donlemon I am a huge fan.  Seriously.  You do a great job and have hit your groove at @CNN.  No jokes.  Just wanted to give you some props.
@KORANISBURNING @zigzagman22 crazy to see a fake anon twitter that is a Russian propaganda bot.  @YourAnonNews is legit.  Don't piss them off Russia they get stuff done!
@jamesirving2 You a fan of bannon?  Why?  Help me understand what you see in him.
@jamesirving2 And then you have @infowars and @realJeffreyLord who help on their own fruition
@jamesirving2 It's not everyone that's a Russian bot.  There are also Russian trolls then the folks that believe you all.
@risetoflyy @jamesirving2 @erock1995_es @beck_amikebeck @InfogretchenMy @HulkHogan @RealKevinNash @WWE @realDonaldTrump I personally know aid workers hiding in fear of further chemical weapons attacks.  You are a troll trying to spread. Is information.
@jamesirving2 @erock1995_es @risetoflyy @beck_amikebeck @InfogretchenMy @HulkHogan @RealKevinNash @WWE @realDonaldTrump Lil' hands was never my cup of tea.  I voted for @joe_exotic you should check out his platform.
@jamesirving2 Can you love your country and still be in favor of playing a role in the world?  Or just splendid isolationism and nothing else?
@jamesirving2 @erock1995_es @risetoflyy @beck_amikebeck @InfogretchenMy @HulkHogan @RealKevinNash @WWE @realDonaldTrump What makes you an authority on the truth?  All the likes and retweets you get from other Russian bots?
@jamesirving2 @erock1995_es @risetoflyy @beck_amikebeck @InfogretchenMy @HulkHogan @RealKevinNash @WWE @realDonaldTrump Lol you crazy Mr. bot.  Your bot friends keep retweeting and I am just fascinated by this bot troll culture I get giddy when you reply.
@realDonaldTrump @dixiefortrump I agree.  At the right time the pee pee dossier will have enough facts to impeach you we will get s handle on #fakenews and then we've #maga
@erock1995_es @jamesirving2 @risetoflyy @beck_amikebeck @InfogretchenMy @HulkHogan @RealKevinNash @WWE @realDonaldTrump Do you always abbreviate are with a capital R?  You need to be trained to troll more convincingly
@adamrandazzo @GovMikeHuckabee I disagree.  If I told that joke from the pulpit even the old people that laugh at everything trite would look at me funny.
@MenaOfficial @GovMikeHuckabee I think these weird jokes are his actual day job at this point.
@GovMikeHuckabee Pastor Huckabee it's time for an intervention.  We love you, but you are not funny.
@GovMikeHuckabee @Walmart @FoxBusiness @FoxNews Was that a joke?  Is you your brain ok?  I think that @jonlovett guy is now definitely slightly funnier than you.
@AnewThomasPaine @HorseShort @realDonaldTrump Why do you all keep retweeting and liking each other?  Its treasonous propaganda spreading really that easy?
@erock1995_es @jamesirving2 @risetoflyy @beck_amikebeck @InfogretchenMy @HulkHogan @RealKevinNash I agree we should inform everyone if the nwo is back in the @WWE @realDonaldTrump will join the faction.
@jamesirving2 @risetoflyy @beck_amikebeck @InfogretchenMy @HulkHogan @RealKevinNash Why do you all keep retweeting the broken English questions?  Is that all it takes to make our information gathering collapse in 2017?
@USFreedomArmy @AnewThomasPaine Amen @realDonaldTrump !  He lets the Russians tell him how to live and lead because of that pee pee dossier.  #maga #banbots #ImpeachTrump
@FlavianReturns @Hijackedgal Dang y'all Russian trolls in the us are getting paid by @SeinfeldTV money.  You know he's Jewish right?  What is the deal with Russian bots?
@FoxNews @DonaldJTrumpJr @SebGorka That is the dumbest headline I've ever seen.  @FoxNews you guys are factually absurd.  Lil Donald you shouldn't retweet nonsense
@DonaldJTrumpJr @realDonaldTrump I agree with you on this one lil' don.  Maddows piece was silly.  You win that round.  Can we see his actual taxes now?
@DonaldJTrumpJr @veganvecoh I bet you are glad your dad is busy being an agent of Russia so you can try to run his company.  Do you have tiny hands like his?
@LSkisquire you forgot to put up a fake profile pic.  You are a terrible bot or troll you need to get with protocol I'm gonna tell putin
@jamesirving2 @risetoflyy @beck_amikebeck @InfogretchenMy @HulkHogan @RealKevinNash Why do you all keep retweeting each other?  Is that how bots get traction on social media?
@jamesirving2 @risetoflyy @beck_amikebeck @InfogretchenMy @HulkHogan @RealKevinNash  https://t.co/PD2Y4BVmEN
@jamesirving2 @risetoflyy @beck_amikebeck @InfogretchenMy @HulkHogan @RealKevinNash Dude I know all about it. @HulkHogan came down at bash at the beach 97 and turned heel.  It was insane.  Did you see it too?
@jamesirving2 @risetoflyy @beck_amikebeck @InfogretchenMy You should be.  He's not full blooded Russian.  It's why @realDonaldTrump has such small hands.  You should have backed @GovMikeHuckabee
@jamesirving2 @risetoflyy @beck_amikebeck @InfogretchenMy What's does #nwo have to do with this?  @HulkHogan @RealKevinNash back to double crossing us all again??
@jamesirving2 @risetoflyy @beck_amikebeck @InfogretchenMy Prove you're a real person... who's the greatest basketball player of all time?
@jamesirving2 @risetoflyy @beck_amikebeck @InfogretchenMy Your grammar is very unusual.  You have tweeted nothing but insults since your account was started.  Yours are ok though since you a bot :)
@jamesirving2 @risetoflyy @beck_amikebeck @InfogretchenMy You love Russia
@risetoflyy @jamesirving2 @beck_amikebeck @InfogretchenMy @DNC @GOP I am not in a position to strike anyone.  That's a weird response that I feel like is automated.  You a dum bot :)
@risetoflyy @jamesirving2 @beck_amikebeck @InfogretchenMy @DNC @GOP Your third category is weird and not really broad.  Who are you?
@MOVEFORWARDHUGE What's some good news comrade?  @RT_com propaganda?  @BreitbartNews and their racist lies?
@jamesirving2 @risetoflyy @beck_amikebeck @InfogretchenMy Who is we?  Russians in St. Petersburg?
RT @meanoldbaptist: @risetoflyy @jamesirving2 @beck_amikebeck @InfogretchenMy That's an incorrect statement.  @DNC @GOP then a bunch in bet…
@risetoflyy @jamesirving2 @beck_amikebeck @InfogretchenMy That's an incorrect statement.  @DNC @GOP then a bunch in between then there's you... the troll/bot spreading propaganda #russianbot
@tonyposnanski @JordanUhl @realDonaldTrump I hope you didn't like mail order it... you will need that outfit soon.  I also hope we didn't get the same outfit that would be awkward
@realDonaldTrump @NancyGarrity4 Nah bro you wrong.  @realDonaldTrump you still messing it all up.  You dum.  And have little hands. #maga by #impeachTrumpnow
@AnewThomasPaine @HorseShort @realDonaldTrump T pain you must still be tipsy.  Another #russianbot at work
@jamesirving2 @risetoflyy @beck_amikebeck @InfogretchenMy It's your typical split in the party of treasonous hackers and bots... you couldn't expect us to have peace very long.
@MOVEFORWARDHUGE I dunno if the Russian bot should be calling anything fake news.  You are an agent of a foreign power spreading propaganda.  #RussianBot
@jamesirving2 @risetoflyy @beck_amikebeck @InfogretchenMy What's a sheeple comment?  Have the Russians made human sheep hybrids to do their cyber warfare?  Nah they can just use you instead.
@DonnaMartinNeth @rescuetracker81 Fake news from fake people getting traction so it will continue to polarize our society.  #maga by stopping the bots
@HERBERTARTIST @AnewThomasPaine @HorseShort @realDonaldTrump Hi Herbert hope all is well in St. Petersburg today.  Your account should be closed and I hope your bot or troll account is banned.
@comermd Crazy the bot propaganda machine is still going strong
@mitchellvii You need some psychiatric help.
@AnewThomasPaine @HorseShort @realDonaldTrump Also the media is big.  Was it @foxnewspolitics that said that?  @infowars ?  I bet they did those liberal monsters @RT_com
@AnewThomasPaine @HorseShort @realDonaldTrump I don't think think that's true T PAIN.  go back to your auto tuner and make cool songs tweeting isn't for you.  @GovMikeHuckabee
@AnewThomasPaine @HorseShort @realDonaldTrump You know what triggered me?  The fact you are either a bot or you are engaging in cyber Warfare and spreading crazy stuff.
@AnewThomasPaine @HorseShort @realDonaldTrump Who said that?@realDonaldTrump ?
@mitchellvii you don't seem real stellar with being a pundit or radio guy, but you are a great troll.
@McSaddle @GovMikeHuckabee I think he is going to throw his friendship bracelet in the trash and go back to working at Exxon
@GovMikeHuckabee Man you should be preaching the gospel not being a hack of a political pundit.  Come back from the dark side.

@RoguePOTUSStaff what's up with Spicer?  Is he a nice guy?  Seems like he knows he has to straight up lie all the time.
@brobert545 @DebAlwaystrump @foxandfriends Let's deal with treason first, then @FoxNews sexual harassment and cover ups by @GOP and @DNC both
@SteveKBannon why isn't your twitter account verified?  @BarackObama probably told them not to give you a legit account.
@AmberGhost97 @LREwoke @charliespiering @vdare I have checked with a number of sources more credible than you and they tell me whey still study history in school.  Sources are 3rd graders
@charliespiering I thought you worked for Trump and are paid in @SeinfeldTV money.  What gives dude?  You being paid in rubles?
Pro tip from an old preacher.  If you find yourself talking about @realDonaldTrump on Easter Sunday, something went wrong.  #InChristAlone
If @BillWalton were a thin vampire, he would be @realJeffreyLord .  How's that for humor @GovMikeHuckabee @jonlovett @mikeyardcomedy
@realJeffreyLord @fawfulfan @nirvanafanclub @CNN You are silly Jeff.  You make no sense and can't just apologize.  You should be like "my bad I'm just a racist" and move on.
@realJeffreyLord good move with that MLK Trump comparison, you will be spoken about for a few days.  @CNN wan't a good fit for you anyway
To my 1000s of Russian bot followers and 5 humans, remember to always think consistently through an entire issue.
Hey @crookedmedia @jonlovett @jonfavs As a Baptist I am hoping you can land an interview with @GovMikeHuckabee .  Can I help arrange this?
@AnewThomasPaine @HorseShort Kansas voted for @realDonaldTrump by like 40 points.  That means voter fraud helped trump. Its been the Mexicans all along #nottherussians
@AnewThomasPaine @HorseShort All he has left to do now is find several million more and then @realDonaldTrump will be proven correct.
@tarheel_rn @CombatHard @CutestBabyInUSA @Petemoss51 @ERthroatPunchRN @keilani_hope @oinc2islam @thro_e @right_wingflyer @sharon4marie @txGirl4ever_ @Terry_FireMedic @HalfMoonPossum @ms1brinker @scottwilkos I am very concerned about how much that car is smoking in front of you :)
@FoxNews @greggutfeld You guys lack any sort of comedic creativity.  Looks like @GovMikeHuckabee is writing all of your terrible and silly responses.  #tryharder
@yellowredsparks @Cernovich @HardballChris thats stupid even for a russian troll/bot.  you should be reprogrammed or have your Russian pay docked.  Try again and something less trite.
@bfraser747 @Eliz_Hightower We should also fight back in a cyberwar against Russia, which seems like you might be #maga but you aren't on America's side in the war.
I am certain @HillaryClinton and @BarackObama are behind this.  #wiretap #Elevatortap https://t.co/GMUbFRO8m5
@funder @goodgovguru @TheDemCoalition I think all those people committed treason, but you are also making stuff up to make a name for yourself.  You should stop. #twowrongs
@GeorgiaDirtRoad @justanavywife @ConstanceQueen8 @DrLee4America @Deana_merritt33 @Corrynmb @RealKyleMorris @davis1087 @baalter @lingling23 @tteegar does this apply to all that pesky @realDonaldTrump russian collusion treason madness too? #thinkconsistently #isrussianpayingyouwell
I can't decide if @jonlovett or @GovMikeHuckabee is funnier.
@KayaJones @POTUS I just hope that bed that Russia and @realDonaldTrump are in isn't that bed discussed in that Dossier.  #maga #russianhacking
@GovMikeHuckabee I remember when you were funny.  And a time when you seemed to put the gospel first.  What happened to those times?
@GovMikeHuckabee Don't you work for the media?

Let's both get off talking points and have legit conversations.
@LadyDaisy_USA What case are you making with the meme?  You think your opinion is factual huh?  Go read some crazy @infowars and worship @realDonaldTrump
@LadyDaisy_USA You might be a racist if... umm... so many jokes so little space, so... you just are a racist.  Completely racist and hateful. Hahahahahaha
@USAloveGOD @davidmweissman @_AssangeJulian @JohnJohnhowe @wikileaks Julian is still alive and stealing documents.  Will you support him if he turns on trump and russia?
@LadyDaisy_USA You should learn real history and see how GOP and democrats flipped ideologies in the 50s or so
@LadyDaisy_USA The chemical weapons murders were not a hoax it's sad to me you would say such a thing.  Are you from North Carolina or Moscow?
@LadyDaisy_USA Do you also wear aluminum foil hats on your head so the secret Obama government can't control your mind?
@LadyDaisy_USA And a nation of immigrants isn't a nation if immigrants without immigrants.
@LadyDaisy_USA What news sources do you believe?

Even the small number of dems you should respect.

That is short sighted and ignorant to say.

.@realDonaldTrump So why weren't they all paid and forced to attend your inauguration?  Would love to see all the computer bots out in full force!
Hey @realDonaldTrump as far as I can tell like 60 percent of your twitter followers aren't real people or are paid trolls.
Hey @realDonaldTrump now that you are beefin with Putin these bits aren't being so nice about you,  you should tweet that them.
@ChanelRion @MikeBaconheart @realDonaldTrump @NBCNews Hey @chucktodd is pretty well liked all over,  stinks you all deflect from trumps interactions with Russian in a sad nonsensical way.
@MikeBaconheart @gwfrazee @OldCorps1959 @MVZexplorer @aporter925 @LadyDaisy_USA @oleoacres45 @MilitaryMadnes1 @SherriBergan @wcwinc @sbhouston60 @WarthogLvr @oinc2islam @ujblack @TerranceCreamer I am fine with gun talk as long as there is a reasonable line and you aren't installing surface it air missile launchers at your house :)

One of the solutions to crazy stuff imo is to fix mental health system
@MikeBaconheart @gwfrazee @OldCorps1959 @MVZexplorer @aporter925 @LadyDaisy_USA @oleoacres45 @MilitaryMadnes1 @SherriBergan @wcwinc @sbhouston60 @WarthogLvr @oinc2islam @ujblack @TerranceCreamer I'm dumb with twitter meant to put that in your stuff about all news being fake and liberal.  He would be cool with guns if he were alive.
@TheMeemStreams @KNP2BP @American1765 @dodt2003 @GeorgiaDirtRoad @VFL2013 @LVNancy @nia4_trump @skb_sara @DonnaWR8 @tamaraleighllc @GOP @DNC But I couldn't reconcile lying like that with my faith.  And dems and reps are friends and hang out and the rest seems like theatre
@TheMeemStreams @KNP2BP @American1765 @dodt2003 @GeorgiaDirtRoad @VFL2013 @LVNancy @nia4_trump @skb_sara @DonnaWR8 @tamaraleighllc @GOP @DNC Hopefully i don't Id myself when I say this but i worked for the tea party for about a year... they asked me to lie and for a while I did
@TheMeemStreams @KNP2BP @American1765 @dodt2003 @GeorgiaDirtRoad @VFL2013 @LVNancy @nia4_trump @skb_sara @DonnaWR8 @tamaraleighllc @GOP @DNC In my opinion if you want to improve politics add a few more parties to the mix like in the past
@TheMeemStreams @KNP2BP @American1765 @dodt2003 @GeorgiaDirtRoad @VFL2013 @LVNancy @nia4_trump @skb_sara @DonnaWR8 @tamaraleighllc @GOP @DNC So they can just trade off power but never lose it.  That's why it's nearly impossible for a viable third party to rise up.
@TheMeemStreams @KNP2BP @American1765 @dodt2003 @GeorgiaDirtRoad @VFL2013 @LVNancy @nia4_trump @skb_sara @DonnaWR8 @tamaraleighllc Here's my political stance i think all politicians are crooks in a sense and that @GOP and @DNC  are ok fighting with each other
@TheMeemStreams @KNP2BP @American1765 @dodt2003 @GeorgiaDirtRoad @VFL2013 @LVNancy @nia4_trump @skb_sara @DonnaWR8 @tamaraleighllc :). Jokes aside... if you ever want to talk with someone you probably disagree with let me know we can set the example for others :)
@OldCorps1959 @gwfrazee @MVZexplorer @aporter925 @LadyDaisy_USA @oleoacres45 @MikeBaconheart @MilitaryMadnes1 @SherriBergan @wcwinc @sbhouston60 @WarthogLvr @oinc2islam @ujblack @TerranceCreamer My father got his start in journalism covering race riots in the south and got beat up and injured often would he be a liberal today too?
@PtTrippe @RichardTBurnett Oh yea gotta love the Fox News arm of the @GOP .  All those sex claims about papa bear and Roger I'm sure are fake news too huh?
@TheMeemStreams @KNP2BP @American1765 @dodt2003 @GeorgiaDirtRoad @VFL2013 @LVNancy @nia4_trump @skb_sara @DonnaWR8 @tamaraleighllc But what do I know I am trying to reason with a paid Russian troll or a bot... you aren't paid or programmed to just talk without being mean
@TheMeemStreams @KNP2BP @American1765 @dodt2003 @GeorgiaDirtRoad @VFL2013 @LVNancy @nia4_trump @skb_sara @DonnaWR8 @tamaraleighllc Doesn't mean in the end we will agree in everything but maybe we can find compromise and if nothing else a bit more respect for other people
@TheMeemStreams @KNP2BP @American1765 @dodt2003 @GeorgiaDirtRoad @VFL2013 @LVNancy @nia4_trump @skb_sara @DonnaWR8 @tamaraleighllc Civility has been part of American culture.  I seriously hope people that disagree will stop name calling and start actually talking.
@dodt2003 @TheMeemStreams @KNP2BP @American1765 @GeorgiaDirtRoad @VFL2013 @LVNancy @nia4_trump @skb_sara @DonnaWR8 @tamaraleighllc None will be as intellectually stimulating as this one.
@TheMeemStreams @KNP2BP @American1765 @dodt2003 @GeorgiaDirtRoad @VFL2013 @LVNancy @nia4_trump @skb_sara @DonnaWR8 @tamaraleighllc That's not very productive conversation.  What if you stop the mean poopy talk and we talk candidly about issues to find areas of agreement?
Hey @SenateMajLdr and @McConnellPress are you a Christian man?  are you the best @GOP Senator Kentucky can find?  I want to run against you
@gwfrazee Thank YOU for being my new best friend.  You guys tweet so much i am completely impressed.
@Dwhthediver @MOVEFORWARDHUGE @FestusWalker Im not a fan of war, but i think there was no other choice and i think @realDonaldTrump made the right decision and it was a precise strike
@Dwhthediver @MOVEFORWARDHUGE @FestusWalker I am not.  Few people are whining.  I am ok with it and even if i wasn't its within the war powers act i believe(i am not totally sure)
@Dwhthediver @MOVEFORWARDHUGE @FestusWalker He didn't have to get permission
@Rockrider5800 @LeahR77 Rude people like you are the same proof about demons on earth
@surfermom77 @LeahR77 This is insane and you should not post such gross stuff that is also not factual at all
@LeahR77 You aren't a real person and you do not post facts.  Non-facts are also called lies.  Can you translate lie into your native tongue?
@phyllislee2b72 @KazmierskiR @FoxNews Putin can't respect a man with such small hands.  This original tweet is from a russian troll or bot you should delete.
@gwfrazee @oleoacres45 @OldCorps1959 @MVZexplorer @aporter925 @LadyDaisy_USA @MikeBaconheart @MilitaryMadnes1 @SherriBergan @wcwinc @sbhouston60 @WarthogLvr @oinc2islam @ujblack @TerranceCreamer I miss you weirdos today you are all quiet.  Y'all mad that Russia is on the hook for Syria stuff?  Do trolls have real jobs?
@gwfrazee I hope they stop trolling you too... i hate to see my new best friend too busy to tweet at me for a full day.  I miss you.
@GretchenCarlson i was genuinely impressed with your insight during the TED talk that came out recently!
@CohenTisha @philmonaco67 @RealBenCarson So did Clinton do it or it didn't happen at all?  What's your credible source?  You like Russia more than trump huh?
I wonder if @Wendys is a Russian bot too?
@LouiseMensch @RoguePOTUSStaff @US_Stratcom Why did @RoguePOTUSStaff starting having such bad grammar?  Why are you guys beefing?
Man @gwfrazee you have gained thousands of friends in a day and you've been tweeting round the clock.  How do you do it :)
@oinc2islam @WarthogLvr @Anchower @JohnHaugen1970 @gwfrazee @aporter925 @MikeBaconheart @MilitaryMadnes1 @SherriBergan @wcwinc @sbhouston60 @ujblack @MVZexplorer @TerranceCreamer Dude that's honestly one of the best memes I've ever seen.  I have copied it to use to my friends.  You paid Russian trolls are the best!
@WarthogLvr @Anchower @oinc2islam @JohnHaugen1970 @gwfrazee @aporter925 @MikeBaconheart @MilitaryMadnes1 @SherriBergan @wcwinc @sbhouston60 @ujblack @MVZexplorer @TerranceCreamer Are you sure?  Your response seems to leave some wiggle room for a real conversation one day :)

@kwilli1046 @honeybunchesof8 It's not been a good week just better than papa bear's week.  Bill's sexual harassment makes most bad weeks look good comparatively.
@loridehenaut @WarthogLvr @oinc2islam @JohnHaugen1970 @Anchower @gwfrazee @aporter925 @MikeBaconheart @MilitaryMadnes1 @SherriBergan @wcwinc @sbhouston60 @ujblack @MVZexplorer @TerranceCreamer lol I see other people do it i truly didn't use twitter much until recently so I don't understand what I should do.
@WarthogLvr @oinc2islam @JohnHaugen1970 @Anchower @gwfrazee @aporter925 @MikeBaconheart @MilitaryMadnes1 @SherriBergan @wcwinc @sbhouston60 @ujblack @MVZexplorer @TerranceCreamer That's even better I love that one!  I'm glad you're my new best friend!
@nia4_trump @LVNancy @OPCW @StateDept Twitter @Support should shut you down.  You are promoting falsehoods

@WarthogLvr @Anchower @oinc2islam @JohnHaugen1970 @gwfrazee @aporter925 @MikeBaconheart @MilitaryMadnes1 @SherriBergan @wcwinc @sbhouston60 @ujblack @MVZexplorer @TerranceCreamer Nah I believe the earth is round.  What if we had a real discussion about issues or policy would you be willing to do that?
@loridehenaut @WarthogLvr @oinc2islam @JohnHaugen1970 @Anchower @gwfrazee @aporter925 @MikeBaconheart @MilitaryMadnes1 @SherriBergan @wcwinc @sbhouston60 @ujblack @MVZexplorer @TerranceCreamer I have no idea what that means but that is comedic gold too!  See?  That one meme was dumb now you guys are on top of the comedy game
@WarthogLvr @Anchower @oinc2islam @JohnHaugen1970 @gwfrazee @aporter925 @MikeBaconheart @MilitaryMadnes1 @SherriBergan @wcwinc @sbhouston60 @ujblack @MVZexplorer @TerranceCreamer What if we stopped with memes and insults and actually had a discussion?  Would you be willing to do that?
@WarthogLvr @oinc2islam @Anchower @JohnHaugen1970 @gwfrazee @aporter925 @MikeBaconheart @MilitaryMadnes1 @SherriBergan @wcwinc @sbhouston60 @ujblack @MVZexplorer @TerranceCreamer You are totally right I am @Twitter ignorant.  I am going to brush up  on it and then send my resume to Russia then we will be coworkers :)
@Anchower @oinc2islam @WarthogLvr @JohnHaugen1970 @gwfrazee @aporter925 @MikeBaconheart @MilitaryMadnes1 @SherriBergan @wcwinc @sbhouston60 @ujblack @MVZexplorer @TerranceCreamer Funny you block me when I suggest discourse instead of trolling
@oinc2islam @WarthogLvr @Anchower @JohnHaugen1970 @gwfrazee @aporter925 @MikeBaconheart @MilitaryMadnes1 @SherriBergan @wcwinc @sbhouston60 @ujblack @MVZexplorer @TerranceCreamer @GovMikeHuckabee I really genuinely like that one... kudos for that one it's pretty funny!

@Anchower @aporter925 @MikeBaconheart @oinc2islam @gwfrazee @MilitaryMadnes1 @SherriBergan @wcwinc @sbhouston60 @WarthogLvr @ujblack @MVZexplorer @TerranceCreamer Don't be a grammar nazi bro :)

I don't mind grammar mistakes but not from Russian trolls.
@oinc2islam @WarthogLvr @aporter925 @Anchower @MikeBaconheart @gwfrazee @MilitaryMadnes1 @SherriBergan @wcwinc @sbhouston60 @ujblack @MVZexplorer @TerranceCreamer See that's better!  I like that a little more.

I don't understand twitter but seems like you create false traction.
@WarthogLvr @aporter925 @Anchower @MikeBaconheart @oinc2islam @gwfrazee @MilitaryMadnes1 @SherriBergan @wcwinc @sbhouston60 @ujblack @MVZexplorer @TerranceCreamer That's a silly meme I would think you could insult me in some quality way.  Try again please.
@WarthogLvr @Anchower @JohnHaugen1970 @gwfrazee @aporter925 @MikeBaconheart @oinc2islam @MilitaryMadnes1 @SherriBergan @wcwinc @sbhouston60 @ujblack @MVZexplorer @TerranceCreamer What's up with your grammar for real?? They need to fix your programming and translation ability.
@WarthogLvr @aporter925 @66Christo @gwfrazee @LadyDaisy_USA @oleoacres45 @MikeBaconheart @MilitaryMadnes1 @SherriBergan @wcwinc @sbhouston60 @oinc2islam @ujblack @MVZexplorer @TerranceCreamer Women is plural in American English.  You would say "is that a woman".  I know it's different than native Russian but keep at it.
@WarthogLvr @gwfrazee @aporter925 @LadyDaisy_USA @oleoacres45 @MikeBaconheart @MilitaryMadnes1 @SherriBergan @wcwinc @sbhouston60 @oinc2islam @ujblack @MVZexplorer @TerranceCreamer @Support Why can't @Twitter @Support filter out these nonsense trolls or bots that strategically clog up conversations??
@WarthogLvr @66Christo @aporter925 @gwfrazee @LadyDaisy_USA @oleoacres45 @MikeBaconheart @MilitaryMadnes1 @SherriBergan @wcwinc @sbhouston60 @oinc2islam @ujblack @MVZexplorer @TerranceCreamer What does that even mean?  Are you a real person?
@WarthogLvr @oleoacres45 @aporter925 @gwfrazee @LadyDaisy_USA @MikeBaconheart @MilitaryMadnes1 @SherriBergan @wcwinc @sbhouston60 @oinc2islam @ujblack @MVZexplorer @TerranceCreamer Better to be born again in Jesus than withering in Trump and @infowars .  Next time you call someone a simpleton you should proofread first.
@WarthogLvr @oleoacres45 @aporter925 @gwfrazee @LadyDaisy_USA @MikeBaconheart @MilitaryMadnes1 @SherriBergan @wcwinc @sbhouston60 @oinc2islam @ujblack @MVZexplorer @TerranceCreamer Maybe trump has it right working with the Russians because judging from you weirdos we should not be voting on anything important.
@MikeBaconheart @gwfrazee @MilitaryMadnes1 @SherriBergan @wcwinc @sbhouston60 @WarthogLvr @oinc2islam @ujblack @MVZexplorer @TerranceCreamer I would say we take it back once we confirm #potus colluded with Russia
@youimnot @gwfrazee Like no spy ever?  Or just @realDonaldTrump isn't one?  You must be on their payroll too :)
@Cernovich @KazmierskiR Is this reported by any reputable sources or does it originate from @RT_com or @BreitbartNews ?
@youimnot @gwfrazee What does any of that have to do with @realDonaldTrump being a Russian spy?
@youimnot @gwfrazee Just state what it is I should see or the significance instead of trying to be all mystical
@youimnot @gwfrazee Got lost in the madness and lack of clarity and tried to be respectful and just ignore you instead of calling you crazy :)
@CitiznConcern @PrisonPlanet @POTUS @realDonaldTrump He wouldn't have as many millions of followers if he blocked all those Russian bots.
@PrisonPlanet @keywestcliff2 Good questions bro I agree, how long with you and your boys get to get muddying the waters if legit conversation?  I bet a long time.
@ldoyle1955 @keywestcliff2 I don't think they care what the left says... fact is CIA thinks Russia and trump are bromantical and we should let them investigate.
@keywestcliff2 Nah little known fact my friend... Russians can't vote in American elections.  They can attack democracy by screwing up elections though.
@keywestcliff2 It was Russian collusion with trump.  What would they being trying to help Hillary do she's been hiking since she lost in the woods.
@SpecialKMB1969 @SandraTXAS @POTUS @ChooseToBFree @JerseyGirlD2 @steph93065 @jko417 @masspolitica @greeneyes0084 @AMTrump4PRES @michaelharrisdr @skb_sara That's not a true meme I hear of the unmasking coverage often just actually watch the news you will see you aren't correct
@nia4_trump I think it's great you admit guy are a bot.  You're a #classyrobot
@GaetaSusan @ChgocadChic A cult following of bots and trolls
@GaetaSusan @ChgocadChic one of the silliest memes I've seen.  You think the media is making up Russia lies?  Little hands @realDonaldTrump sure has a cult following
@GaetaSusan @ChgocadChic Until people stop retweeting silly memes without fact that get traction through a cycle of bots and paid Russians hackers, we can never talk
@MOVEFORWARDHUGE You aren't a legitimate account,  you Push lies from @RT_com and @SputnikInt to make cinversations murky.
@PGAngela4 @DanielleTwyman1 You dint strike me as a real account,  do you get paid to act silly in social media?
@youimnot @gwfrazee your have no racial background?
@youimnot @gwfrazee So did we establish if you are a Russian bot or not?
@youimnot @gwfrazee Oh gotcha.  What does this revelation mean to you?
@youimnot @gwfrazee What does it mean though?  What are you getting at regarding politics?
@youimnot @gwfrazee You a smart bot
@youimnot @gwfrazee Oh so you don't really have any sort of conclusions huh?  Don't start spouting off insane theories without at least knowing the ending.
@youimnot @gwfrazee Can you draw some kind of conclusion for me? I don't see it.
@RoguePOTUSStaff does the president know anything about technology?  You should tell him his followers are all robots to hurt his feelings.
@youimnot @gwfrazee No... I'm just waiting excitedly for you to finish these links
@youimnot @gwfrazee I read the original Greek and hebrew.
@youimnot @gwfrazee I have flipped back one page to gen. 1.  Also I need to know the source of this knowledge can you tell me who taught you?
@youimnot @gwfrazee I find it pretty condescending to do a step by step walk through so cut to the end and tell me your juicy scoop on nod.
@youimnot @gwfrazee As a cranky Baptist I actually know the Bible pretty well.  I am probably the Donald trump of bible scholars which means i am the best ever.
@youimnot @gwfrazee I haven't accused @realDonaldTrump of being a bot though with his tiny hands he could probably use the help in typing his tweets.
@youimnot @gwfrazee Not everyone just the ones that present like bots.  Take it as a compliment that you seem as smart as a Russian algorithm.
@youimnot @gwfrazee Thanks for the hint it means wondering and probably no specific territory but I would love to hear some crazy theory so tell me where it is.
@gwfrazee No problem are you a Russian bot?  I think you are and that you should be shut down.  Thanks for adding me though take care robot man.
@Suthen_boy are you a Russian #bot or are you just a racist?
I wonder why we can't shut down Russian hacker bots like @Dihydr0gen ?  @Support  why can't you identify them as nefarious?
If you quote @XNSNews or anything they retweet in your sermon you are quoting legitimately false information.  #reallyfakenews
@rushtonbowen @goodgovguru @FBI @GenFlynn @PaulManafort makes you wonder what politicians Manafort helped while under contract w Russia
Hey @Twitter @Support is this guy a spy or something?  Or a bot?  Can I tell if an account is a bot? https://t.co/OmI35zaZ1I
@Coach_Hipep you are a bot.
@youimnot I feel bad I am your only human friend. And kind of dumb for having fun engaging with a bot.  It's still fun though.
@youimnot then what do you look at?  @newsmax @alexjonesshows @RT_America @hoax ?  Bots don't need to absorb news they make news.
@youimnot  it you refuse to discuss the both/and and want to focus on those with whom you disagree Mr. Robot Putin
@youimnot so we we are clear i think all politicians are corrupt and I don't doubt some demcrats need investigation.
@youimnot let's get back to @realDonaldTrump and @PaulManafort and how they are acting on Russia's behalf.
@youimnot it's the stellar articulation of posts like this and your impeccable debate skills that make me think you're a bot.  Or insane.
@youimnot what did he open?  Can you send me some legit news to show me?  Was in that cool box from Indiana Jones that glows?
@youimnot also,  that was proven false.  Do you believe in facts?
@youimnot since you are an atheist I won't really entertain that you are allowed to define my faith.
Someone tell me what this guy meant?  He blocked me  when I answered his statement.  Is that a coded statement? @maddow @nytimes @AP https://t.co/Z1Dc6v8VmZ
Someone should check out @youimnot and see if it's a poorly working bot.
@youimnot @DevinNunes who appointed Yahweh to be a special prosecutor?  Good news is God already knows his Russia connections.
@youimnot @DevinNunes we can look at that again just as soon as we're done seeing if trump is a Russian operative. You're deflecting again.
@youimnot I dunno Mr. Russian bot or should I say Comrade Bot... breitbart isn't credible and you are deflecting it seems.
I wonder how many real followers @realDonaldTrump has and how many are bots?  @maddow does anyone know?
RT @TeaPainUSA: Trump's gettin' ready to learn about "The Art of the Plea Deal." #TrumpRussia
RT @TeaPainUSA: Sorry folks, but Meals on Wheels ain't workin'.  They feed seniors one day and by the next day they're hungry again. #Budge…
was going to troll @RogerJStoneJr today but realized he only attacks women and their rights.  He and @PaulManafort prob busy anyway #treason
@RogerJStoneJr do you have any reputable sources?  Your Russian connections should help you get at least halfway reasonable sources
@RepAdamSchiff your chairman @DevinNunes should both resign and explain his actions
@PaulManafort what's up bro?  U in Russia?  Hmu bro thinking about running for office want to get Putin's opinion.
@mikeyardcomedy what happens if Manafort has quietly helped a ton of these GOP guys?
@JonathanMerritt it's probably a good time to teach folks about the guy the award is named after :)
@PaulManafort how many @GOP guys did you influence while Russia paid you?  ever consult for @DevinNunes ?  @TGowdySC ?
Why did the leader of an investigation into @realDonaldTrump in @DevinNunes report to the ones being investigated today?  So disheartening.
Yo @DevinNunes as a republican I think you have gone too far and have lost your objectivity.  Please work to appoint special prosecutor.
Hey @DevinNunes did you know @realDonaldTrump was working with Russia during the campaign?  Does that make you an accessory to the crimes?
Hey @maddow is "Russian bot" your slang for "classy patriot".  I choose to believe the dozens of commenters on this fake account are real.
Hey @maddow how dare you insult my  twitter traction to claim all the weirdos that commented on my @realDonaldTrump jokes are "bots".
RT @TrevinWax: We all know that lying usually leads to more lying. Here's how we go down the staircase of dishonesty. https://t.co/OJg4ml6N…
@1Gini @tonyposnanski @realDonaldTrump what's he done so far?  Actively covering up Russian ties shouldn't count as his accomplishments.
@DavidEHankins offer still stands to dialogue.  Without either of our pseudonyms.  We both drop crankybaptist personas and talk about it.
@DavidEHankins you are just mad I took this pseudonym before you could get it.
@DavidEHankins I will take that as a no by the way.  You should just be honest and say you have beef with anyone from Southern Seminary.
@DavidEHankins @ERLC don't want to get bullied and have you tell my church to withhold her tithes.
RT @JonathanMerritt: Can't say it in church? Try a podcast.	https://t.co/SWeCISIplI
@rachelheldevans as someone who won't always agree with you... we should be ashamed that any woman would just get used to this hateful talk
@rachelheldevans Also, I  want one of the big SBC guys supporting these men to explain to my daughter one day why this behavior is ok .
@rachelheldevans its sad when our partisan politics seems to choke out the gospel where we don't stand for obvious right and against wrong.
would @DannyAkin encourage students to withhold from SBC like @jackngraham?  I would ask @albertmohler but @DavidEHankins wouldn't care.
@dustinsams also, in general, seems @realDonaldTrump wouldn't be the basket to put our eggs in as baptists. Jesus? or @GovMikeHuckabee ?
@dustinsams amen.  I love the CP and I think its fine to have a discourse, but it leaves me sad to know most of these guys won't respond.
Last time @jackngraham.  You were excellent in the elephant room talks.  Seriously great. You've been a hero, but now I now disappointed.
How do you feel about @jackngraham and @LaBaptists withholding tithes @bellevuepastor?  Going with church autonomy?
P.S. @ncbaptist , like 50% of the people you follow are at @SummitRDU.  I think someone has a crush.  bad news for you. #shesnotthatintoyou
Are state conventions ok w churches withholding giving if we disagree with things?  @ncbaptist @GABaptist ? @Prestonwood set the example.
Do @ronniefloyd @jdgreear @_PPatterson_ @pastorclint agree with @jackngraham against Moore?  Will any of you clearly take a stand?
Can members of @Prestonwood hold their tithes if they disagree with @jackngraham ?  Make much of @GOP and if time... maybe mention gospel.
Given the option, a reformer or a non believer that is in @GOP, @jackngraham and @DavidEHankins take @realDonaldTrump over a believer.
Google helped me figure it out.. nevermind @DavidEHankins you're just doing what you need to do to get rid of the calvinists.
I remember being taught our giving to the CP was like a church's tithe.  @jackngraham @DavidEHankins are you advocating withholding tithes?
I think its obvious what's going on.  @drmoore helped @BarackObama "wire-tap" @realDonaldTrump thanks @jackngraham for showing us the truth!
Do @LaBaptists love the GOP more than Jesus?  @DavidEHankins is @realDonaldTrump really that virtuous to you?
I am sure men like @DavidEHankins would never opt to engage with me in discussing their beef with @ERLC .  Prove me wrong and lets talk.
thankful for men like @DavidEHankins for validating my deep belief in withholding my tithes to bully someone out of leadership. @LaBaptists
Wondering if @jackngraham and @Prestonwood stop withholding when more Russian spy info comes out?  Nah,altering course is a sign of weakness
Glad @jackngraham has confirmed that its completely ok to withhold your tithe if you disagree with a leader. I told them God was ok with it!
@veydayresalco your account should be banned By @twitter.  You are just a spammer.
@veydayresalco I can say without a doubt that video was not for me.  That's lunatic crazy level.  Wow.
Hey @HillaryClinton we know you are behind hurricane Matthew.  You probably used Clinton Foundation money to help Matthew immigrate here!
Help @realDonaldTrump do not let @HillaryClinton give hurricane Matthew a path to citizenship she will hire him to rig the election.
Hey @realDonaldTrump you and I both know @HillaryClinton and @BarackObama are behind this hurricane.  Expose this use of the weather!
Hey @seanhannity stop sabotaging my small hands hero.  @realDonaldTrump told us to call you hit me up with your digits so we can talk!
Hey @realDonaldTrump I will call that Sean Hannity guy for you.  Just let me know his phone number.  Sorry he won't just speak up for you.
@LuannKellyRudd it does suit me... It part of this thing called Satire... It's pretty neat you should check it out one day
@greeneyes0084 Good by my new best friend, we probably need some time apart... With us being like two peas in a pod and all.  I Cor. 10:31
@greeneyes0084 fair enough.  I just hope you don't want to answer the question because you aren't exactly sure how to answer it.  Romans10
@greeneyes0084 please accept my apology and maybe one day you will see a funny or silly tweet from me and it make you think about Jesus.
@greeneyes0084 However you are right and that's why I am not going to comment on politics much or at all this year.
@greeneyes0084 I would think they would have been endearing since I was trying to summon my inner trump.  :)
@greeneyes0084 where I should have stayed.  Making light of things that guys like me do wrong in church to take the focus off of Jesus.
@greeneyes0084 I am not trying to be snarky in my question about your faith.  I went too far picking on politicians and am steering back...
@jimib007 you get a paradox where you are judging me by telling me not to judge trump for judging Mexicans and then boom your mind is blown.
@jimib007 that passage is taken out of context when used how you use it.  I think it's biblical to call sin what is it and racism is sin.
@greeneyes0084 your bio says you are a Christian.  Can you tell me about that?  Politics are dumb, tell me about who Jesus is to you...
@lonelyvoice You know he's constantly telling lies right?  Like all the time? The others do too but focus in, you say trump doesn't lie?
@greeneyes0084 your brilliance has left with with no argument.  Just playing you make no sense at all.
@greeneyes0084 the trouble with thinking @realDonaldTrump fans can think logically is that they don't think at all.  Have a linear thought.
@greeneyes0084 but you posted that he is a morally upstanding man that doesn't drink.. Now you say not to get on my moral high horse?
@MrsS0S @greeneyes0084 @realDonaldTrump He hates my sin.  It why Jesus died the death I deserved and lived the life I should have lived.
Finally got the truth out of a young church planter. He wasn't wearing skinny Jeans Sunday. He accidentally wore his wife's pants!
@greeneyes0084 @realDonaldTrump 's mother should be very proud of his strip clubs, and his wineries and his unethical business deals.
As an old legalist I've found common ground with frat boy church planters... None of us like strong preaching! #talktome #justwanttofeelgood
@GOP is pandering to baptists with all this talk of Roberts rules of order. "I call for the question" is the safe word to stop discussions.
@Olerato19 @Ameen_HGA the gospel is for all peoples we stand together even when famous people step out of line.  Jesus is worth the stand !
@stevenfurtick Have you ever read the Bible?  I will send you one if you need one.  You really should read it before the next time you speak
@stevenfurtick Confession: I think your style is awesome.  It's too bad what you are saying is without a doubt absolutely heresy.
@ElevationChurch What if I turn to what's salty?  Or Bland?  or I just don't eat?  @stevenfurtick When I don't eat whats sweet i eat meat.
@ElevationChurch Pray that other pastors would stand up to @stevenfurtick and call for him to repent of his heresy.
@stevenfurtick you may burn in hell for all eternity if this is what you believe but at least your haircut is fresh to death.
Thank you @stevenfurtick for pointing out that God sinned.  It makes me feel a lot better about my own sin.  #heresy https://t.co/1jPji594hQ
@realDonaldTrump She was touching you because she was concerned you were sick because of your incredibly small hands.  She was worried.
@nicoledavis2343 @ScopePhotos thank you for that compliment.  Are you a robot or an android?  Cyborg?  What's the correct term?
https://t.co/QkIEtA4ZO9. @realDonaldTrump does that line work for you?  #pervert
@realDonaldTrump not everyone can harness the energy you have. Not everyone went to the Adolf Hitler school of public speaking.  #nevertrump
@realDonaldTrump democracy it incredibly unfair.  How dare anyone run against a man with such small hands?
@BishopJakes you should make Jesus the one in focus not yourself.
@realDonaldTrump that weak insult sounds like the insult of a little fingered vulgarian
@realDonaldTrump who are your top choices?  @JudgeJudy ? @JudgeGregMathis ? @SimonCowell is a great judge and he's pretty mean like you.
@jordansenecal @DrOakley1689 I didn't have to work very hard to pick a fitting name for my personality.  Thanks! yours fits you too.
@DrOakley1689 you used to be my hero and I listened to you often... But it seems you've shifted into a hard headed jerk that doesn't listen.
@DrOakley1689 just wait until your friends at @PulpitAndPen get mad at you then it will be real in your face nasty.
@DrOakley1689 you are brilliant to take control of a conversation this way. You are a smart enough bishop to have a convo if u want.
@KevinMOliverATL I didn't think your tone was harsh... He has to control the flow of a conversation he will use that joke.  Sad isn't it?
@KevinMOliverATL  White never wants to discourse his pompous pride keeps him from being able to do that.  I used to respect him a lot.
@DrOakley1689 have you ever considered the fact you are a smug jerk to be a sinful stumbling block worthy of repentance?  If not, you should
@seanhannity @realDonaldTrump One on One implies competition or something adversarial.  Not casual convo that looks like a first date.
@realDonaldTrump you should go on #dwts... tiny hands are better suited to dance not lead countries.
@jonathanfalwell here's your chance at redeeming using Liberty as a political tool  @realDonaldTrump what does the resurrection mean to you?
I have a question @realDonaldTrump Who is Jesus to you?  If you aren't sure check out @TwoCorinthians521  Thats about Jesus.
@tonyr951 @WDFx2EU @HillaryClinton Lies don't seem to both you, but that picture seems to be from Istanbul Turkey.  #dontgetnewsfrommemes
@az_valentine @tonyr951 @RealBenCarson The cost of idiots us immeasurable to us as well, we don't send you guys away.
I am sad that @realDonaldTrump hasn't tweeted today.  Maybe his tiny hands can't hold an iPhone 6 Plus
@GovMikeHuckabee I bet you weren't very funny as a pastor either...
@stevenfurtick God certainly isn't trying to give you a self esteem boost.   I like your hashtag because you are unqualified to preach.
I am going to spend some time pointing out scriptures @realDonaldTrump violates.  His blind followers won't care.  @followjesusnottrump
@tonyr951 @LeahR77 @grammy620 @realDrumpf #nevertrump Trump is racist and memes about killing protestors aren't funny.  The End. #vulgarian
@tonyr951 @LeahR77 @grammy620 @realDrumpf that's a weird change of subject, I thought you were telling me how you aren't racist.
@tonyr951 @realDonaldTrump I'm sorry you have no information to dispel your racism.  Just embrace your ignorant racism like a good nazi
@tonyr951 @realDonaldTrump Nah the baptist way should be the way of Jesus and salvation in him.  Jesus calls his followers to not be racist.
@tonyr951 @LeahR77 @grammy620 @realDrumpf oh and man are you ever toying with me, I feel so toyed with.  You probably have small hands too.
@tonyr951 @realDonaldTrump @realDrumpf it seems like your knowledge is founded upon memes and youtube videos, do you have any proof?
@tonyr951 @realDonaldTrump read the title of that video?  I am not asking to show me who supports him.  He says racist stuff, refute them
@tonyr951 @LeahR77 @grammy620 @realDrumpf I mean it by the way, just show me where I'm wrong and I will openly admit and support him.
@tonyr951 @realDonaldTrump its cool that lady is excited.  What about the stuff he says about mexians being rapists and muslims and jews?
@tonyr951  @grammy620 @realDrumpf Just point me to facts that help me see he's not a racist liar.  I promise if I'm wrong I will admit it.
@tonyr951  @realDonaldTrump So no real discourse?  You just say he's obviously not racist and dont talk about the evidence?
Maybe @realDonaldTrump is sad its march madness and his small hands keep him from playing basketball.  Don't worry you can get youth size.
@tonyr951 @LeahR77 @grammy620 @realDrumpf have you seen this stuff?  i can't believe the hate to think murder memes are funny.
@tonyr951 @grammy620 @LeahR77 @realDonaldTrump what if on your dumb meme the facts and rational thought lead me to believe he's racist?
@tonyr951 @grammy620 @LeahR77 @realDonaldTrump tell me how's he's not racist.  BTW, memes from adults are strange lets just have real talk.
@realDonaldTrump let's make up.  I got some gloves in the mail they are children's small.  For too small for a real man, just right for you!
@realDonaldTrump thank you, for allowing North Carolina to see racism is still an issie.  #youareracist #smallhands #poorlydressed #loser
Too bad @realDonaldTrump couldn't help build the wall in case mexico doesn't, with his tiny hands and probably bad credit and all.
@tonyr951 @grammy620 @LeahR77 @realDonaldTrump nah, I'm pretty well rested.  I just don't like jokes from racists about murder.
I think @realDonaldTrump dresses like a peasant that is only worth millions not billions.  @CLewandowski_ get the man some decent clothes.
@realDonaldTrump @DumpFoxNews @FoxNews @megynkelly If tiny hands Donald weren't so racist and didn't lie so much.. maybe they leave him be.
@Early__May @realDonaldTrump great decision to vote for the racist liar.  I am proud of you for showing your true values.
@gene70 @realDonaldTrump I would think this is a joke but your people are insane.  Donald is racist and so are his followers its that simple
@realDrumpf @realDonaldTrump  is sad.  He is a short fingered vulgarian and just needs a friend.  Creepy hands or not, we should help him.
@realDonaldTrump I think I got you figured out.  Being a vulgarian with tiny hands has made you sad. And all you want is a hug. #hugs4trump
@tonyr951 @grammy620 @LeahR77 The true american way.  @realDonaldTrump should be proud you think murder so so funny.  Shame on you.
@BarronG510 @realDonaldTrump is also corrupt. What makes him the guy you will stand behind?  The racism and lies?
@realDonaldTrump @tedcruz @realDrumpf or maybe you are the master of your domain?  Nah I know you debate with your daughter in mind too.
@realDonaldTrump who is the better debater?  You, @tedcruz or @realDrumpf ?  You strike me as a chronic master debater that is well polished
@realDonaldTrump You have a lot of class and all of it is low.  And you are a short fingered vulgarian.  @realDrumpf
@realDonaldTrump I would love to be with you but I have class and I'm not a racist.
@realDonaldTrump I really wish I could join you tomorrow.  But I am a Christian and think the things you say are sinful.
@realDonaldTrump is this @realDrumpf guy like your alter ego?  I bet he's the person you would be if your tiny hands didn't make you so sad.
@realDrumpf @realDonaldTrump Its his tiny hands that keep him from being able to develop anything.
@realDonaldTrump you the only one that can get jobs back?  Why wouldn't you do it either way to #MakeAmericaGreatAgain?  Oh, just a lie.
@realDonaldTrump @jsconlon11 @BertShad @FoxNews @megynkelly I wish they did... I wanted to be captain of that squad.  You are a weak man.
@WSJ what kind of psychopath constantly makes bold statements for all people everywhere?  @realDonaldTrump that's who.
@realDonaldTrump you have too.  You know that right?  You have been involved in corruption most of your life?  Have you looked at yourself?
@realDonaldTrump You know who has man sized hands and is a real man's man of a leader?  @VinceMcMahon you should get his help.
@nytdavidbrooks I was not aware vulgarians with little fingers were literate.  I bet @realDonaldTrump just needs some help with phonics.
@grammy620 what draws you to @realDonaldTrump the most?  The Racism?  The pathological lies? The stuff about the walls?  The little hands?
@realDonaldTrump @MELANIATRUMP  That kid has bigger hands than you too.
@DrOakley1689 I got the reading hearts gift around the same time you gave yourself the seat of Moses to be the king of all theology.
@jankfart It Donald Trump doesn't respond to my no point in having a concealed identity I will send you some vimeo links one day..
@jankfart every Sunday just about.  Some big some small... its interesting how people take my sense of humor in different places.  ha!
@jankfart I am going to start a new church, praying about specifically what city we might launch in.  I preach in a different church..
@Ameen_HGA or we get disappointed.  I pray your boldness shows us all its time to own up to our mistakes and move forward in the gospel.
@Ameen_HGA call my friends church to continue to rehash the issue he publicly apologized for ... That's why Jesus always has to be the hero.
@Ameen_HGA I respect White highly, but he's bullied one of my friends even after an aplogy and I can prove he kept having a guy call...
@jankfart A little encouragement and some time to really study the Bible and you would be surprised how much passion you get.
@jankfart I used to be real bland with that... I took a little sabbatical and learned under some awesome pastors.
@realDonaldTrump @GStephanopoulos @ThisWeekABC His strategy is to stir up trouble and violence and bully and threaten all the way to Nov.
@CLewandowski_ @realDonaldTrump Its been a slow news day?  Did you bruise and bully enough reporters to make them calm down?
@jankfart Could have been practical... the body of christ in one leg pocket, a flask of the blood in the other.  How was his message?
@realDonaldTrump because your followers are racists and you are a liar and you are inciting half of this stuff on both sides. #uhavelilhands
@jankfart seems to be a gospel stumbling block.  And why did he need the extra pockets?  He have like communion bread in the leg pockets?
@realDonaldTrump Make sure you keep your hands in your pocket no one wants to see the hands of a short fingered vulgarian.
@jankfart I'm not telling you to pick your church based on how dope the pastor dresses, but I dunno if I can abide by zipper cargos.
@Ameen_HGA He should apologize for that.  The fresh looking white boys that would do the same or worse will get a pass.  Racism is sin
@jankfart ohhh you did't tell me he had zipper pockets.  I guess at least they weren't those break away cargos for ballers that dress up.
@realDonaldTrump @megynkelly You should stop stalking Donald its going to get in the way of your overall message of hating other people.
@jankfart Was it fresh looking or frumpy?  It all depends on how someone wears it I think...
@jankfart Someone preached wearing cargo pants?  Who preaches in utility pants?  Please don't tell me there was a skinny tie involved...
@CLewandowski_ did you tell @realDonaldTrump about your freedom friends idea yet?  I bet he will love it!
@realDonaldTrump @CLewandowski_ unsolicited advice.  Your graphics game is weak stop using MS Paint to make these images.
@nytimes @CLewandowski_  you know what they say:  Small ad spending budget, very very very small hands.
@realDonaldTrump trick question.  The reboot is currently being filmed and its called "Make America Great Again" starring real Liar, Trump.
@realDonaldTrump Shouldn't that make you and her buddies?  Release some taxes bro be a man you know you want to.
@realDonaldTrump @LindseyGrahamSC @SenTedCruz I agree with your reasoning here but Question 2:  Why do so many not trust you?
@realDonaldTrump Is this the club for hand growth?  Might be worth your time and 1mil to make your tiny hands grow is probably a deal.
@realDonaldTrump we know where you bought them gloves and it wasn't the men's department.  #vulgarianhands #Ifitfits #mustbealadysmedium
@realDonaldTrump @jojo2foxy Focusing in on the socks of enemies a good tactic, it will keep the focus off Trump's tiny hands.
@realDonaldTrump 42% unemployment?  Where did you get that stat some guy in a @DennysDiner men's room? Urinal talks are usually misleading..
@realDonaldTrump I have some advice for you.  Don't get your facts from email forwards or from facebook re-posts.  Its a common mistake...
went to @PolitiFact to look at pants on fire ratings.  @realDonaldTrump has so many pairs of pant on fire I got 2nd degree burns!
@oreillyfactor Do you miss Jon Stewart?  Are you going to vote for trump?
@realDonaldTrump you know who has presidential hands?  That @BarackObama guy. You look at his hands and you just see natural leadership!
@perrynoble @newspring I am praying Jesus will save you this Sunday @perrynoble !
@robertjeffress Help a Christian brother understand why you endorse trump.  Cite some scriptures if you have any and aren't scared...
@davidjeremiah would you help your fellow christian understand why you endorse @realDonaldTrump ?  What christian fruit does he bear?
@realDonaldTrump on the count of three lets say John 3:16 today and show our taxes. 1-2... wait you don't know any bible verses...
@realDonaldTrump face it, @megynkelly isn't that in to you. It would never work.  Both married, And let's not forget about your little hands
@AzLeeshy @realDonaldTrump @megynkelly If he wasn't a rich racist people would be telling her to get retraining orders.
@realDrumpf @realDonaldTrump you ever notice his freakishly small hands?
@WGinetta @BeckettJerry @EdMurrow2 @realDonaldTrump @Ma1973sk @FoxNews @megynkelly "When you hate trump, racists hate you back"
@DHecei @realDonaldTrump  @megynkelly Its shameful to see how hateful you people are.  That lady is a mother and you bully her? youneedjesus
@hillx123 @realDonaldTrump @Ma1973sk @FoxNews @megynkelly is #alwaystrump code for "I'm Racist" or "I hate a lot of stuff" or "Always right"
@LexingtonBobby @realDonaldTrump @Ma1973sk @megynkelly your negative spin only worked for these guys when the spin matched their opinions
@realNickBrooks @EmmaKennedy @realDonaldTrump Unifying around hate is equally dangerous.  I want a true conservative that isn't hateful.
@realDonaldTrump @Ma1973sk @FoxNews @megynkelly Brilliant move Trump.  The "No, YOU are!" one will get them every time.  #classy #smallhands
@realDonaldTrump @megynkelly  They are scared your hands are too little to turn the knob to open the door to her show.
@realDonaldTrump @CNN They get those huge ratings because everyone just gazes at your tiny hands and thinks "My god his hands are so tiny"
@realDonaldTrump @jojo2foxy He also makes delicious steak, has the best wine, and is an expert at filing bankruptcy and with hate speech.
@BreitbartNews How y'all gonna compare @realDonaldTrump and Reagan?  you must be eating them mushrooms growing in the cow poop on my farm.
@BreitbartNews Is this a true statement?  Maybe you should do a little digging. I guess you guys are too busy bruising your staff to care.
@AnaxiosD As one of your white brothers in Christ, I stand with you and am glad you take a stand here.  John 17:21
@AnaxiosD I got this twitter account to crack some jokes, but no Joke, I stand with you on this.  We can't ignore the fact racism is real.
@Ameen_HGA can you send me some links as to where he said these things?
@Ameen_HGA as one of your white brothers in Christ, I stand with you.  Shame on anyone that dismisses racism.  Go to ALL the nations...
@Ameen_HGA One of the saddest thing in my years in ministry are heroes being unwilling to see their blindspots of sin.  It's heartbreaking
@Ameen_HGA I joke a lot, but proud to see you take a stand with respect.  We can't pretend racism isn't a thing.
@realDonaldTrump  This move is beneath you Trump.  We get it, you only dislike @megynkelly  but love the rest. Step up your bully game man!
Current issues can be blamed on the constitution.  If not for silly rules, we could have @billclinton v. The Terminator. #T800overTrump
@megynkelly I've hope you've learned your lesson about journalism young lady.  You ask real questions, guys like @realDonaldTrump cry foul.
This is a picture of a lady with @realDonaldTrump 's body double, @THEGaryBusey.  Think twice about rushing the stage... Busey is no coward!
@ChrchCurmudgeon your strong language concerns me.  What is this Hi-Purple-Le you mention?  Some violent word?
RT @Bible_Time: The entire law is summed up in a single command: "Love your neighbor as yourself." -Galatians 5:14
@realDonaldTrump you waiting to see if you will come speak at my church.  bring @CLewandowski_ and speak on how to handle criticism. SLAP!
@BarnabasPiper please dont  @realDonaldTrump has worked hard to take hate to new heights.  Mocking him would unravel a lifetime of hard work
@realDonaldTrump @jessebwatters I didn't love it, and my mom says I'm somebody, so therefore not everybody loved it.
@realDonaldTrump @AndreaTantaros I'll take a shot in the dark and say he only thinks you are a true professional because he agrees with you.
@realDonaldTrump I see you had a good day of rallies.  @CLewandowski_ didn't hurt any reporters, he only messed with a little kid.
@jankfart Also, some guys go the skinny jeans and tight sweater route, but sometimes I think they are just wearing their wive's clothes...
@jankfart I do the jeans and a blazer but I'm told it's 2000 and late... It's whatever was popular 10 years ago... so just look back to 2006
I will stop tweeting about @realDonaldTrump as soon as @kanyewest steps up to tweet at Trump.  He's the real pro at this!
@jankfart Probably not.  I live on a farm with some cows and chickens and just watch Bonanza all day.  Explain it to me...
ProBully tip:  So someone calls you racist.  Say "No YOU are the real racist against me!"  @realDonaldTrump taught me.  #imrubberyoureglue
I knew liberals would resort to reverse racism to make @realDonaldTrump look bad. He will call @johnlegend a loser! https://t.co/wpmNtizSph
In a @realDonaldTrump world I can cuss and bully all I want and just tell people they are being Liberals if they are upset.
Trying to #MakeAmericaGreatAgain has distracted from my calling, fussin' in church. I will say pastor hates America if he gets Jesus-y on me
@micahfries Do you think his popularity will go away?  I am trying to figure out what he could do to lose his base.  They are loyal!
@robertjeffress don't let anyone shame you for standing with a racist. @realDonaldTrump will cost you at most your soul.  Mark 8:36
@realDonaldTrump Advice please; Why do church people love you so much? I am the Trump of my church and they dont give me same respect. Help!
if @realDonaldTrump says what you are thinking, you need to read the Bible.  Read it a lot more.  Actually have you ever read it at all?
@realDonaldTrump we want to send church kids to @TrumpUniversity, Do we mail you the money or just throw it in a volcano?  #sameendresult
@NCGOP I just fact checked this.. @HillaryClinton is right.  Don't pull a @realDonaldTrump and call a bluff on a huge lie.  #49inpayisntbad
I like @realDonaldTrump because he says what real people think.  My thoughts are not Trump's thoughts, and my ways are not his ways.  #bible
@NCGOP @HillaryClinton Don't worry about @HillaryClinton you have the @realDonaldTrump card!  He will fix education!
@NCGOP thanks for your help tonight guys in getting Trump's hate out and making this the NC I know and love again. Can he beat Hillary?
https://t.co/nOpQ85lQSt	This guy has my vote!
Help me out @realDonaldTrump get all the pastors that voted for you to tweet.  Its time to separate out the men from the crazy.
@realDonaldTrump how about that Trump wine?  Can we get some of that for communion?
@JarrodFleeger88 @jankfart you are rude. who cares I'm dumb and vote for a racist liar. Trump gets his way, and I get to vote for crazy.
@ThomTillis Keep up the good work!  Get rid of that new fancy educatin' stuff, the common core.  I was learnt up gud, no reason 4 change.
@realDonaldTrump You're all winners President Trump! We are going to be using you as our example of a great man in Sunday School Class!
@FakeJDGreear as this voting wraps, its clear that @realDonaldTrump is going to be your opponent for Pres.  Pro tip:  don' mention his hands
@realDonaldTrump I expect you to say something amazing in your victory tonight... can I play it Sunday in church?
We are going to have a fundraiser at the church next week, hoping @realDonaldTrump can us some of those steaks he sold at Sharper image...
We talked about @realDonaldTrump in Sunday School.  He hates all the same things we hate... so we are thinking he will be our new god.
If you're a Christian and voted for @realDonaldTrump, just own it and proudly retweet this and share about voting for a racist hate monger.
Help us find our next pastor... http://t.co/MNYso64Vgv
As a deacon I value pastoral leadership that is strong enough to lead the congregation to do exactly what the deacons dictate.  #DoWhatWeSay
I like that @ChrchCurmudgeon guy.  He tells it like it is!  #IDoNotUnderstandHumor
Why do all the bible thumpers bash @BishopJakes for mogul-ism but not @RalphLauren for fashion mogul-ism?  #TheBishopLikesNiceClothesToo
I told my preacher I don't have any troubles with him telling misleading stories.  It doesn't hurt anything just ask that @NBCNews anchor.
Give me that old time religion... Not the one where guys were martyred that's too old time... That time when it was like Mayberry and safe.
I am looking for a bible that is just the words of Jesus... Except matthew 23 I didn't care for that part. #john316 is all I need
know why we need more Knee-ology than theology?  I tore My acl during altar call! Seriously i would rather ask God for stuff. #bibleisboring
Also friends be careful, this Duh Carson he mentions is not Theologian Ben but some guy too lazy to spell The.  #dacarson #dabears
Pastor has been misleading us.. he quotes piper and it turns out it's @JohnPiper not Don Piper.  Deception! #90minutesinheavenisforreal
Helping my pastor preach better... Funny joke, church people good, the world is bad, close with story of god giving me something... Go home.
I personally don't care if our preacher is a calvinist... As long as he lets me CHOOSE to be PREDESTINED to be building &amp; grounds chairman.
Our new preacher is getting all preachy on Sunday mornings... Time to fix that!  #timetofightaboutsomethingsilly #givemethatoldtimereligion
No one understands why I have been SS director 25 years.... Someone has to skip bible study it might as well be me. #beyondthegospel
