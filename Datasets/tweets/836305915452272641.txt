Optimism among U.S. manufacturers — as measured by the @ShopFloorNAM — has never been higher, reaching a record 92.4 percent in 2018. The U.S. GDP is growing at a healthy clip of more than 3 percent, a rate that no one predicted a few years ago.
After more than a decade of stagnation, the U.S. economy has entered a virtuous cycle of economic growth. U.S. manufacturing employment has increased by almost 500,000 jobs since @realDonaldTrump was elected, the most job growth in this essential sector in more than two decades.
Now, more than ever before, America is open for business. And, we are diligently working at creating a level playing field and a system of reciprocal trade that will enable you to sell more products everywhere in the world. https://t.co/VbYwNPt1o3

The United States cannot sustain innovation without having manufacturing. They are dependent upon each other.
The Administration is trying to rebuild our manufacturing sector… If you go to a sporting goods store, and check the country-of-origin labels, virtually everything Americans are buying is now made offshore… Almost all of this gear was once produced in the United States.
The number of foreign visitors to the United States in 2018 remains strong, and those visitors are spending at a record-setting pace, up by 3 percent for the seven months ending in July.
Tourists in America “spent a record $251 billion in the United States, accounting for 32 percent of all of our exports from the U.S. services sector.”
@SecretaryRoss: The rate of job growth for the outdoor recreation sector in 2016 — at 2.3 percent — was greater than the overall rate of job growth in the economy at 1.4 percent.
@SecretaryRoss: The numbers… are simply phenomenal… The outdoor recreation industry generated $412 billion in revenue in 2016, accounting for 2.2 percent of U.S. GDP in 2016.
@SecretaryRoss: Thanks to @SteveDaines and @SenDonnelly “for their leadership in drafting and passing the "Rec Act," creating the data series we are releasing today describing… the outdoor recreation industry on the U.S. economy.
