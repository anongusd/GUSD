@FuzzyDunlop235 ah, but livestock in general emit methane, you know. So pigs, too.
8) Ok. Back to laughing.
7)And how to pay for mass trillions in cost? Don't worry! Federal Reserve will just "extend credit" And "new public banks can be created to extend credit too." Because, you know, like, money is just paper, and how hard can it be to make some more of the stuff, right? Right?
6) Planes run on fossil fuel. No fossil fuel, no visits to granny. Cows produce methane, why alarmists want to get rid of livestock. She can't do it "fully" in 10 years, but AOC is coming after ur air miles and bacon. This is honesty about how Ds wud micromanage private life.
5) Key part though people is bit in fact sheet that explains why resolution is not immediately banning fossil fuels or demanding zero-emissions across economy. Because "we aren't sure that we'll be able to fully get rid of farting cows and airplanes that fast." Note "fully."
4)Somehow, government-run healthcare, "family sustainable" wages, paid leave, and "affordable" housing are also "required" for a clean economy. I would love to understand this logic. (And imagine what wages will need to be to pay for billion-dollar-per-kilowatt electricity)
3) Also, AOC would put charging stations "everywhere," upgrade or tear down "every building" in the country (homes and businesses), install high-speed rail across every state, upgrade all our infrastructure. (Maybe once Ds allow permitting reform? LOL. LOL. LOL.)
2) See Ron Bailey for look at sheer number of turbines, solar panels, facilities necessary just for the "renewable electricity" bit. Wud need 500k square km, bigger than California. Also note, govt will pay for these--not private sector. https://t.co/wQ0C6wonha

4.. including even staging a show trial for a posthumous conviction of Magnitsky. So yes, count me skeptical of many claims about the whistleblowers.
3) Magnitsky Act has been exceptionally painful for bad actors in the Putin regime, since it targets individuals. It is exceptionally hated in Putin circles, and one response has been to destroy the reputations of those who brought it to light...
2) it was the foundation of a years-long DOJ investigation into money laundering involving Prevezon, and other investigations that continue into entities that laundered the illicit funds. All this evidence is just... wrong?
1) Why does that matter? The Russian tax fraud uncovered by Magnitsky/Browder has been thoroughly investigated/documented by governments, independent journalists, human-rights groups; it is the basis for Magnitsky laws in US/Canada/Britain, passed on sweeping bipartisan bases; https://t.co/zWoqwgjnV6
@CourtneyBot_XX @Dave_Matherly @1foreverseeking @stranahan @dbongino The United States government initiated civil forfeiture procedures against Prevezon, on grounds it laundered money from a Russian tax fraud--that Magnitsky/Browder uncovered. You are saying that is wrong?
@stranahan So you take the side of Putin and his cronies, who are behind those accusations?
@jensantamonica @WSJopinion I think he is a lot more reliable than Putin and his cronies, who (as this indictment shows) are behind the smear campaign against Browder. But you are welcome to take Putin's side.
It is worth rereading what Bill Browder has to say about Veselnitskaya and her ties to Fusion GPS, in light of her indictment. That Russia-Fusion connection is far more extensive and notable than her one-time meeting at Trump Tower. 	 https://t.co/VDK4XChhLC via @WSJOpinion

I think that's also a fair read. Judge's position might be: either fight the charge or take the deal--but don't ask me to save you. https://t.co/qN1PRgKPiZ
That Judge Sullivan asked Flynn if he wanted to withdraw his plea means Judge was at least open to the idea of gov. misconduct. But once Flynn said no, Sullivan really had nowhere to go. Flynn's decision to stick w/ this deal is still separate from question of gov actions.
@DerekLarsen7 They only thing the Special Counsel's office had against Flynn was FARA, a law that until Mueller was rarely if ever enforced.
4) If you are a small-business owner, and the FBI shows up at your door, it is a good bet they are questioning you as part of investigation. But if you are a govt official, you routinely talk to all kinds of departments, including FBI, on issues not investigatory.
3) So the FBI had a responsibility to explain to Flynn that he was being interviewed as part of an investigation into his actions. That McCabe suggested he didn't need a lawyer and that the agents chose not to give him all the facts so he would stay "relaxed" is the opposite.
2) Why does this matter? Because government officials talk to each other all the time, not as part of investigations. As the McCabe memo from that day itself makes clear, the initial part of his conversation with Flynn was about a training exercise.
1) Those in the media who are exonerating the FBI by claiming it had no duty to warn Flynn about lying are (deliberately?) missing the point. Legal scholars note that the real question was whether Flynn understood the interview was taking place in an investigatory context.

Oh, that's probably right. Pesky redactions. Though either way, looks like a 302 exists somewhere. Albeit not with Judge Sullivan. https://t.co/yOz2yE9L3j
Agents say they didn't think lied. Also, McCabe memo has a redacted line that makes it sound as if Flynn tells McCabe that he knows there are likely transcripts of his talks with ambassador. So why lie?
2)  And here is what the Strzok 302 just filed to Judge Sullivan says: Both agents "had the impression at the time that Flynn was not lying or did not think he was lying." 	So remind me again so many folk treat everything @Comey says as gospel truth?
1) So this is what @Comey told the House last week about agents who interviewed Flynn: "the conclusion of the investigators was he was obviously lying..."
That's a great point. And something that came out of the report into the Ted Stevens case, which Judge Sullivan oversaw. FBI played way fast and loose with 302s. https://t.co/aMtKaGP4V6
The Strzok interview specifically says he was "primarily responsible for taking notes and writing the FD-302" after the Flynn meeting.
Fascinating that the 302 referenced in the Flynn filing is actually an August interview of Peter Strzok--recounting the Flynn meeting. Though this raises the question... where is the original Flynn 302? Did special counsel file it to judge?

BREAKING: The judge in the Flynn case--the no-nonsense Judge Emmet Sullivan--is now demanding referenced docs (McCabe memo, FBI 302) related to that infamous Jan 24, 2017 interview w/Flynn. Also has ordered gov to turn over any OTHER docs related to that meeting--by Friday.
RT @julie_kelly2: @KimStrassel Comey just admitted he violated protocol by calling Flynn directly. Said he “couldn’t have or wouldn’t have”…
6) Also worth noting that two FBI officials behind this moment have themselves been fired for misconduct: Andrew McCabe and Peter Strzok. Court has cause to throw this whole thing out.
5) Ask which sounds more likely: That a highly decorated military officer invited FBI officials to his office (with no legal counsel) in order to tell bold-faced lies? Or, as initially reported, he just forgot details of conversation?
4) Instead, it looks like they set this up to catch him in a lie. They don't tell him about transcript. They encourage him to do the interview with no lawyer. Also deliberately choose not to give him standard warnings on lying. This is how our law enforcement operates?
3) A paratrooper, Army Ranger, intelligence officer, three-star-general, and then National Security Adviser. That's a resume that earns you benefit of doubt. FBI had the transcripts of the ambassador conversation and could have just noted that and asked him about it.
2) Remember, at this time, the FBI's investigation was still secret. Flynn did nothing wrong in contacting the ambassador, and had no reason to believe himself in legal jeopardy. Meanwhile, this was a man with 33 years of exceptional military service.

4) Perhaps most disturbing is her claim that Ds will be civil again once they are reelected--which borders on a threat. In essence: When we lose, we will respond with despicable tactics, and if you want that to stop, you will have to put us back in power.
3) What she's really saying is: "We can't be civil to a party that beat us fair and square...."
2) That is the very nature of political disagreement. Which is precisely why civility is necessary, and that we settle such differences in respectful debates, and at the election box. Losing an election and a Supreme Court seat is not a justification for overthrowing that system
1) More than anything else, Clinton's comments on "civility" show an utter lack of self-awareness, and/or critical thinking. Every political movement in history has believed its opponents want to destroy what it "stands for" or "believes in."

Actually, the goal of journalism is presenting facts--and presenting them on both sides of any given issue. Americans then get to work out themselves, on the basis of those facts, the truth. We don't need press to divine it for us. Just try who/what/where/when/why/how https://t.co/I6LAXl21YF

5) Finally, Committee wants any other interaction she had w/ reporters on allegations. Much has been made of Ford testifying. That's but one piece. Refusal to turn over key evidentiary information is highly concerning, to say the least.
4) This BTW, totally contradicts Ford's sworn testimony ("Never") that she had ever given tips or advice to someone who was going to take a polygraph. Press has been calling half America to try to trip Kavanaugh w/ perjury. We will see if it tries to track down this one person.
3)Why else this matters? "Committee has received a sworn statement from a longtime boyfriend of Dr. Ford's, stating that he personally witnessed Dr. Ford coaching a friend on polygraph examinations."
2)Also a demand for any audio/visual copies of her polygraph test (which she bizarrely claimed no knowledge of mere existence in testimony). Also polygraph charts and data--given it is utterly unfair and useless to rely on the "results" without seeing materials to show accuracy
1) BIG:  Chairman Grassley also sent a letter today to Ford's attorney demanding she provide "material evidence relevant" to her allegations. That includes her therapy notes, which she happily relayed to the WaPo, but is now claiming are too sensitive for anybody else. Huh.
9) Sidenote: To read the entire timeline of actions--dozens of interviews and emails, outreach, questions, all related to Ford, Rameriz and false claims--is to destroy those who claim that an FBI investigation was ever necessary. Senate Judiciary has been working hard.
8) Bottom line: Next time someone in the press repeats D claims that nobody is evaluating the Swetnick claims, just laugh. Given how absurd the claims are, that Judiciary is dealing with them at all is a a testament to its good faith effort to investigate.
7) Oct. 1 investigates email from person who claims knowledge of Swetnick allegations; it also speaks with two employees at a company where Swetnick worked; it also speaks with an attorney for an ex-boyfriend of Swetnick. Oct. 2: Speaks to 4 MORE people who knew Swetnick.
6) Same day, Commitee interviewed another person who had "had a dozen interactions with Ms. Swetnick over a period of four years, who has a negative view of Ms. Swetnick." Sept. 28 Committee then interviews ex-boyfriend of Swetnick's.
5) Next day (Sept. 25), Committee asks Swetnick be made available for interview; Avenatti ignores request. It asks twice more that day. Also speaks to a "a friend" of Swetnick's, who says Swetnick had "never previously mentioned either Judge Kavanaugh or this alleged incident."
4) That timeline makes clear the Committee reached out within minutes of Swetnick's attorney (Avenatti) Tweeting he had a client with allegations on Sept. 23; yet he refused to supply info/evidence. The next day Committee asks Avenatti again; again he declines.
3) (It was in fact total collapse of her claims, tho he politely refrained from saying so.) Grassley notes he has enclosed another timeline of his actions to investigate all claims, including those that were "frivolous" but that he took up "out of respect for my colleagues."
2) It was response to a Sept. 26 letter demanding withdrawal of Kavanaugh nomination, based in part on Swetnick allegations. Grassley letter begins by noting that yesterday, Swetnick backtracked on basic allegations in interview with NBC news.
1) Since my mainstream colleagues are more interested in ice than facts, allow me to provide a few. Today, Judiciary Chair Chuck Grassley sent letter to all 10 Ds on his committee.

Nope, no holes. Other than when it happened, where, the changing statements on how many present, their genders, who did the pushing, what's really in the therapist notes... The entire problem here is huge holes in the very facts that might allow Kavanaugh to disprove claim. https://t.co/gb2UMj0oMb
I wonder if Spartacus is going to express similar concern about the "assaults" on the "dignity and humanity" of Kavanaugh.. Hmmmm.
Message to Hirono: It is possible to treat accusers with dignity and respect, while not also taking any allegation at face value, without evidence.
Again, correct. https://t.co/qFyRsRdZMm
Then again, if @amyklobuchar, or any Democratic senator so far, had done their duty of asking any probing questions of Ford at all--rather than congratulate her on appearing--we might know a great deal more. https://t.co/l3ue29DJWV
Correct. Correct. Correct. GOP needs to be smarter than to fall for the media line that this is somehow a popularity contest. https://t.co/e5B1e38i6Q
This can't be said enough. And so saying it again. The Senate is doing as thorough if not more thorough an investigation than the FBI would/could. It is talking to same people, getting same evidence. Anybody calling for FBI investigation is doing so purely for delay.
Just heard Blumenthal say that she has witnesses who can "corroborate" her story. Um. No. She doesn't. That is in fact the problem.
@NaradaNature Due process is not confined to courtroom. It is how we settle everything in civil society.
Again, a reminder to media pals: the standard here isnt where you “look” or “sound” “credible”. It is whether you provide evidence. All witnesses she has mentioned deny her claim—that was case before this started and remains case now
There is no evidence. The burden of proof here is—must—be entirely on Ford. Not the other way around. That is the most fundamental aspect of due process. Lose that concept and lose our most basic protections. https://t.co/fhfVYZZFGZ
So wow. Ford counsel says that the reason they refuse to provide to underlying data for polygraph is because committee won’t let their polygraph guy testify. More demands; more withholding of information.
Actually Ford has to admit she flies all over the world for her hobbies. A tough moment for her because goes to credibility/truthfulness. https://t.co/v7v5DtJAyl
Ford seems to acknowledge that nobody has seen her therapist notes other than her counsel. Sounds as if she “summarized” it for WaPo reporter.
There is only one point that matters in this hearing so far: Ford has not offered any new information. Nothing to substantiate allegations. Tho GOP counsel has raised some big questions about her account.
Even Mazie Hirono admits to NPR no corroborating evidence.. “without any corroborating evidence and without the testimony of Mark Judge who was there who’s a really close friend of Judge Kavanaugh, we are left with deciding who is the more credible person,” Hirono said.”
Durbin laments “cheap shot politicians” as he proceeds to rack up cheap shots.
And here come the calls, again, (leahy) for FBI investigations, delays. Though guess that is not surprising given committee Ds are not very interested in gathering facts from Ford themselves.
So much for Grassley’s call for civility. Feinstein  is up there accusing Kavanaugh of every wild claim.
Put aside the restraining order/history here. What says more is Avenatti's incredible claim that it is against all rules to even question a "sexual assault victim." To even question. 	https://t.co/YmRNkZvbTr via @politico
4) To be clear, we don't know the credibility of this. Any more than Ford accusation. But summary of Judiciary actions is compelling--and should be on website soon. Anyone who suggests Grassley has not done all it can for a thorough, fair investigation is not being honest.
Sorry. Break from Kavanaugh to indulge happy thoughts. This is amazing, and beautiful. I love libraries. Needed to retweet. https://t.co/hAIH9gcM2b
3)Wed. Sept 26: "Committee staff receives a more in-depth written statement from the man interviewed twice previously who believes he, not Judge Kavanuagh, had the encounter in question with Dr. Ford."
2) Tues, Sept. 25: "Committee staff have a second interview with a man who believes he, not Judge Kavanaugh, had the encounter with Dr. Ford in the summer of 1982 that is the basis of her allegation.  He described his recollection of their interaction in some detail."
1) Huge: This from new Judiciary timeline: 	Mon.  Sept. 24: "Committee staff have first interview with a man who believes he, not Judge Kavanaugh, had the encounter with Dr. Ford in 1982 that is the basis of his complaint.  He submitted a written statement earlier in the day."
More: Judiciary Committee sent letter today to Ford's attnys requesting 1) audio/visual recordings taken during Fords's polygraph; and 2) charts/data used in drawing polygraph conclusions. Ford's attnys just now refused to supply, saying such material not "important." Really?
Republicans need to remember their job at tomorrow's hearing tomorrow, which is actually quite straightforward: To see whether Ford can provide any credible evidence of a 36-year-old claim. Everything else--teenage beer drinking, protests, tears, prep school culture--is noise.
Indeed, which is why one question for Ford tomorrow needs to be: How and when did you retain attorney Debra Katz? Was Feinstein/Democrats involved in that, and/or polygraph? https://t.co/71SgpEP8z9
Absurd. Absurd. Absurd. It really is the only word for this afternoon, and latest claims. Well, maybe also: Ludicrous. Insane. 	It is astonishing press is even reporting this stuff.
This is important. And remember, therapist notes said four boys in the room. These are basic details, which she cannot seem to keep consistent. https://t.co/JriQbWj2ML
Avenatti has done such a disservice to the #MeToo movement. We have gone from some initial strong cases (ie, Weinstein), to absolutely wild claims that a woman witnessed boys spiking drinks and lining up to "gang rape," and not only didn't report it, but kept going back. Absurd.
Ford's attorneys have now turned over polygraph results. But are refusing to give the committee her therapist notes. This matters, since those notes would show what she actually said in that 2012 session, and if it corresponds with what she says now.
Correct. The have offered four people who say she once told them about misconduct, decades after it happened. That is not  proof that it happened. If i told you i had flown to Pluto and you swore that i told you i had flown to Pluto, it doesn't mean i flew to Pluto. https://t.co/0WdzzMeUNy

Still waiting for @emmersbrown to explain a few things. Ford told her therapist in 2012 there were four boys and her at the party. Now we hear three boys and a girl. WaPo has glided over this glaring inconsistency, trying to claim  "six" people at party. Who is No. 6?  Sloppy? https://t.co/zURyDAszOa
Here's an @NBCNews headline. Truth is exact opposite. They need to get facts straight. (see my prior tweets): 	"John Clune, attorney for second woman who has accused Judge Kavanaugh of sexual misconduct, says Republicans on the Judiciary Committee are giving her the runaround."
12) Finally, as you can read, claim by Clune that GOP "blew off scheduled call" (CNN headline) is flat out falsehood. Majority always said testimony/evidence first.Says something that an attny resorts to such deceptions. And that CNN wud report w/o checking.
11)This is a serious accusation. No law enforcement would commence investigation without such statement--this is basic request, in line with any committee probe.Yet every polite request for basic on record statement is ignored, rebuffed, delayed, denied. GOP has bent backwards.
10) A few hours later, Majority makes 6th request for information/statement. Then Mr. Clune goes on CNN to complain at length about Majority "game playing."
9) (Democrat staff now intervenes with email apologizing for Majority "preconditions." Offers to put Ramirez attnys in touch with FBI. And offers to get on evening call, undercutting majority request for information.)
8) Majority responds, again, that before next steps (call), they need to know if Ramirez has evidence other than that in New Yorker article, and will she provide evidence/testimony to investigators? (5th ask) Again they would "welcome" that evidence, in any official form.
7) Next morning (Tues., sept. 25) Ramirez attny ignores request again but says since he hasn't had "confirmation on this call" he is "now unavailable." Now suggests everyone talk end of day.
6) Majority instantly responds it "welcomes" any evidence in form of "email or letter" to chairman/ranking, or same from counsel, or statement to committee investigators. (4th ask)
5)That evening (still Monday), Ramirez attnys refer to New Yorker article as "evidence," again demand FBI investigation, say client won't talk before more "details of whatever process you are contemplating."
4) Few mins later,majority says thanks, but asks again if Ramirez has evidence/statements she is willing to provide to committee? Ramirez attnys defer to as-yet-undefinite call. Majority responds that before "next steps" (call), does Ramirez have evidence/testimony? (3rd ask)
3) At 10:30 pm, a Ramirez attny says will get back. But not till Monday, 3 PM, does Ramirez attny say she wants FBI. Says she might be open to be "interviewed in person"--though only "on appropriate terms (and unclear if by committee or FBI). Attnys suggest call . . next morning.
2) First majority email goes Sunday, Sept 23, two days ago, hours from when New Yorker story runs, 7:43 pm. It goes to attorneys, notes story, asks when Ramirez is available for interview. Says it is "determined" to take statement and "investigate further."
1) Breaking: So Debra Ramirez's attorney, John Clune, went on CNN's Anderson Cooper 360 tonight. In interview, he accuses "game playing" by "majority party" with regards her testimony. But read the emails that have gone back and forth (I have), and that is downright false
2) So anyone who says Republicans aren't providing second accuser with a chance to present evidence is speaking false.Senate can't be expected to to handle an allegation if accuser won't provide a statement to official investigators.
1) Important: Sources tell me that Senate Judiciary staff have now asked Deborah Ramirez, through her attorneys, to provide a statement or any corroborating evidence on five separate occasions. Each time, declined.
I'm struggling to remember the last time a witness to the Senate was given authority over how the Senate would operate. 	If this is the excuse for a no-show, it is no excuse at all. https://t.co/0ar6YxcQhX
3) If your only interest is delaying a nomination, yes, you'd call for an FBI investigation--since it would take a long time and keep everyone in the dark. But if the goal is informing senators before a vote, the committee is absolutely best vehicle for the job.
2) A Senate committee investigation can be every bit as thorough--as evidenced by the many people that have been contacted already. But here is the big difference: Senators can demand who gets contacted, what questions be asked, see immediate answers, demand follow on.
1) Those who continue to call for an FBI investigation are either a) uninformed or b) partisans. Remember, the goal of this particular exercise is to inform Senators of facts (it isn't a criminal inquiry) An FBI investigation is black hole, in which Senators have no role/control
Republican Senators (all of them) would do the nation, due process, and themselves a big favor by making clear that Thursday is Ford's opportunity to testify, and there will be no more delays. Set out the clear, fair rules--then proceed. It would help shut down the circus.
Senate Judiciary should hold this hearing (which it didn't have to hold), and question as it sees fit (which is its right), and if Ford chooses not to answer, it should consider that a refusal to testify. Accusers who hide behind process arguments are harder to take seriously. https://t.co/WvNCi1AOhp
Also, clear something up for me....  We just heard all week that we are required to "believe" women. But when Ashley Kavanaugh provides testimonial, the left dismisses her.
@Lee_the_Tweeter Thank you for so clearly making my point about selective moralizing.
The hate storm being leveled by the left at Ashley Kavanaugh is a good indicator of what they really think of women---or at least any women with whom they disagree. So enough already with the liberal lecturing about "respect" and "bullying."
"There is a phrase for what is happening here: character assassination."	 https://t.co/qW265EBtcZ via @WSJOpinion
Strong floor speech from McConnell. Especially his unequivocal statement that Kavanaugh will receive a full vote on the floor of the Senate. That's an important message.
Good for Kavanaugh. And good for Grassley/Hatch/Cotton. Setting out a timeline, sticking to it, and forcefully calling out smear campaigns is the only way to end this circus. 	 https://t.co/dHyzpwl5Kq
"If Republicans surrender on the basis of what we know now, they will face the fury of their own voters — and rightly so."	 https://t.co/iz2lbpxaE8
2)Maybe. But NYT reports that Ramirez contacted former classmates "in an effort to corroborate the story." Fair to wonder if he was among those contacted, and to what degree he was reminded of the "details."
1) Interesting. The New Yorker story finds just one classmate of Ramirez's who claims he heard this story at the time, even as it has to admit he wasn't there. Still, to give him credibility, New Yorker notes that he "independently" recalled "same details as her."
An excellent line-by-line takedown of irresponsible (non) journalism. 	 https://t.co/KzImqyUwPC

2) So, her letter says five people. Therapist notes say five people. Your reporter, @emmersbrown, emails Judge saying five people. But now that the genders don't all match up, the other side is saying, well, actually, six people. Again, who is the mysterious sixth person?
1) Whoops on your part. It would seem her legal team is changing the story as it goes. Because here is the text from her letter to Feinstein: "The assault occurred in a suburban Maryland area home at a gathering that included me and four others." https://t.co/0WlDtGdNYC
Question for the Feinstein camp, and media mouthpieces: Why use the latest completely unsubstantiated claims to call for delay, and deprive Ford of the opportunity to tell her story on Thursday? Ford says she wants to. So time to do it. No more delays.
The left made a mistake with this Ramirez story. It isn't just how embarrassingly flimsy it is; she was inebriated; took six days to find memories; everyone denies it. But it strongly suggests the Ford delay demands were about cooking this up. Destroys credibility all around.

In any event, we all stand ready and waiting for WaPo to identify the now mysterious "sixth" person at the party. "Six" people conveniently makes Ford's numbers add up. But without a name, its just that... convenient. @emmersbrown https://t.co/7KbsQCWJS4
2) @emmersbrown email to Judge certainly doesn't name a sixth person. Presumably because Ford hasn't/can't provided a name for that sixth person?
1) Actually, @AaronBlake has not explained why WaPo sat on Keyser's name, allowing narrative that it was her and four boys. If they said that all "along," why didn't WaPo report at the time on a supposedly now mysterious sixth person? https://t.co/NN4F3PyIgy
@AaronBlake Who is "they"? And it still remains that WaPo didn't report the name of the other woman at the party, even though it had it from the start. Why?
11) Wow. "Before her name became public, Ford told..." That is WaPo admitting that it had the name, and had Ford's response to what would clearly be a Keyser denial, but NEVER PUT IT OUT THERE. Again, why? A lot of people have a lot questions to answer.
10) In its most recent update tonight, WaPo writes: "Before her name became public, Ford told The Post she did not think Keyser would remember the party because nothing remarkable had happened there, as far as Keyser was aware."
9) What, you can't find Keyser? She has lived in the DC area a long time. The paper had no trouble tracking down the other two men (btw, who also denied such party). And why not publish Keyser's name? It published the other men's names.
8) Other problem: WaPo's reporting. Reporter has for a week had the names of those Ford listed as present. One is a woman. Yet it writes a story saying FOUR BOYS. Why? Maybe a mistake. But if so, why did WaPo never correct that narrative?
7) So first, huge problem: This was just a week ago, and we have Ford giving two different accounts of who was present. Four boys. No, three boys, one girl. Either way, therapist notes from 2012 definitively say four boys, which Ford didn't dispute. But now... a girl!
6) Wait, say what? WaPo reports publicly that Ford says it was "four boys,"even after WaPo reporter tells Judge that Ford had told her it was three boys and a girl.
5) "The notes say four boys were involved, a discrepancy Ford says was an error on the therapist’s part. Ford said there were four boys at the party but only two in the room.”
4) This matters for two big reasons--Ford's credibility and WaPo's. The subsequent WaPo story would go on to cite Ford's name and details, and also list notes from a therapist that Ford told this to in 2012. Read carefully what WaPo reports, the same day it emails Judge:
3) One part of the email to Judge reads: "In addition to Brett Kavanaugh and Mark Judge, whom she called acquaintances she knew from past socializing, she recalls that her friend Leland (last name then was Ingham, now Keyser) was at the house and a friend of the boys named PJ."
2) The email wants a comment from him. The subsequent story would reveal Christine Ford's name, and give details of the supposed "assault."
1) More big breaking news, which further undercuts the Ford accusation, as well as media handling of it. A source has given me the email that WaPo reporter Emma Brown sent to Mark Judge, one person Ford claims was at the party. This email is dated Sunday, Sept. 16, 2018
@gpmrntz These are formal responses to the Senate.
Wow. And CNN reporting that the fourth person, Leland Keyser, is denying memory of knowing kavanaugh or of this event, even though "Keyser is a lifelong friend of Ford's."	Wow, again.
@CeoLeo9 See my follow on tweets. Statement from her lawyer.
And BTW, where does that put all those folks who claim the new standard is that we must automatically "believe" women? Because here is a woman, and she is saying Ford has it wrong.
So to be clear: All four people named have said this party never happened. It isn't even as if one of them is saying, "oh, i remember the party, but my memory of how things played out is different." They are saying it NEVER HAPPENED.  That is powerful evidence.
Statement from Leland Keyser's attorney: "Simply put, Ms. Keyser does not know Mr. Kavanaugh and she has no recollection of ever being at a party or gathering where he was present, with, or without, Dr. Ford."
1) Breaking, and a big deal: Fourth person that Ford named as present at infamous event denies even knowing kavanaugh, much less ever attending a party where he was present.

3)  Democrats know this, and are willfully misleading by suggesting FBI has a different role here. That is not how it works. It would in fact be wildly irregular for FBI to do anything more than it has, and would look highly political .
2) As FBI has said, it has put her detailed claims in the file. (And she has been invited to testify.) That is the FBI's job done. As FBI has noted, any other "investigation" would be handled by local law enforcement--that is if statute of limitations were not long past.
1) GOP needs to do better calling BS on Democratic demands for an "FBI investigation." FBI background checks of nominees involve interviewing people, and putting results in a file. The report goes to WH/Senate, solely for guidance. FBI isn't sleuthing "crimes" in these checks.

3) Wouldn't it be lovely if the Democrats now so concerned about "hidden" and "concealed" documents showed 1/4 as much interest in the docs that DOJ/FBI won't release about its Trump-Russia investigation.
2) If they choose to move ahead anyway, they should be held fully accountable, under both Senate rules, and the law
1) On this document fight, it is pretty simple. Democrats don't get to unilaterally release documents under executive privilege. We have rules and laws. You don't get to break them just because you "don't like" Donald Trump or his nominee.
RT @JCNSeverino: I'm trying to remember Sen. Whitehouse's takedown of Justice Kagan for her association with this shady group. https://t.co…
LOL https://t.co/M4DrpDrtME
Sen. Whitehouse says pattern of SC decisions shows "bias" for "right wing, corporate special interest groups." Wrong. Wrong. Wrong. Pattern shows Supreme Court has a majority that shares a judicial philosophy. Which happens to not be Sen. Whitehouse's. But elections matter.
When Sen. Whitehouse talks all high-minded about the need for more disclosure, what he really wants is laws forcing the names of new targets for progressive activists to harass. This is now a settled strategy on the left. Read "The Intimidation Game"
2) Also wonder how much time he's spent running down the "dark money" behind those progressive organizations...
1) It is very amusing to listen to Senator Whitehouse complain that Republicans work with groups like the Federalist Society. I wonder which of his liberal progressive activist groups (NARAL, Alliance for Justice, Sierra Club, Emily's List, and on and on) gave him that point.
People are allowed  their own opinions on guns, but not their facts. Yes, Senator Feinstein, semi-automatic firearms are commonly used. Even if you have never met people outside of San Francisco who commonly use them. #Kavanaugh
@BenSasse: The question isn't what Kavanaugh wrote 11 years ago, but whether he has the temperament to sit on the court... to be fair and dispassionate. 	What a novel concept. Thanks to the senator for reminding us.
@BenSasse is so worth listening to. Tune into his speech in the Kavanaugh hearings for substantive thoughts on the separation of powers, how everything has gone wrong, and why these hearings are a farce.
To repeat: These aren't "his" documents, and any Senate Democrat who claims that is being dishonest. It needs to be said. These are papers that landed on Kavanaugh's desk while WH staff secretary, which he shuffled to intended recipients. He didn't author them.
RT @ByronYork: Emails from Sally Yates' 10 days as acting attorney general could tell Congress a lot about the Trump-Russia affair. Of cour…
Actually, I'd argue real difference is the pool of docs under discussion. D's are defining these as any doc Kavanaugh touched as WH secretary (even those he didn't author). Same definition NOT applied to prior nominees like Kagan (whose records from SG office never turned over). https://t.co/QggwUw4nb2
In light of this story, it would see Warren's 2012 claim that she didn't know how Harvard came to list her as Native American is false (she was the one who listed herself such). So why isn't that a focus of this piece? 	 https://t.co/4cSnT9EZMl
Sen Ted Cruz with the fact of the day: The more than half-million documents turned into this committee on Kavanaugh are more than those submitted for past five supreme court nominees combined.
2) Also hard to see how it helps with what is Democrats' ultimate goal: to deny him confirmation. To do that, they need to convince moderate Republicans to vote no. But this behavior/attacks likely to unify GOP, if for no other reason than that it is unfair to the nominee.
1) The tradition (both sides) is to use hearings to attack judicial philosophy of a nominee. But the vicious, personal accusations Democrats are leveling at Kavanaugh (corrupt, a liar, a sneak) are something new. May play with the base, but likely offputting to average viewers.
Can't wait for Trump-state Democrats (McCaskill, Manchin, Donnelly, Heitkamp, etc.) to justify/condemn their liberal colleagues' unprecedented tantrum. Up to now they've claimed to want to hear a Kavanaugh hearing, so let's see if they tell Judiciary Ds to let him.
Senate Dems in Kavanaugh hearing: All we are asking is for Republicans to throw over all precedent and procedure, so that we can pretend we didn't lose the election....

21. THE PINOCCHIO TEST: There are no facts wrong here, so no pinocchios based on WaPo's preferred pinocchio standard. But fact checkers are also more than capable of rearranging words and details to create a misleading narrative. so, pinocchios galore on that front.
20) "Trump’s mention of Ohr’s wife appears gratuitous. Her role in the matter, as yet, appears minimal." She worked for the main player in this drama, Fusion. And Fact Checker has zero ability to make that claim, since we still don't know her role. Bizarre.
19) "There is also, as yet, no evidence that senior Justice Department officials were even aware of Ohr’s sideline communications with Steele about the Russian probe." Wow times three. That some in DOJ didn't know is one of the problems. Who set this up? Who was kept in dark?
18) "At this point, it’s unclear what Ohr even told his friend at the FBI about Steele’s information" Wow again. Where does this "friend" come from? why put it that way? Ohr was debriefed by FBI agents at least 12 times, contents in official 302s. This isn't water cooler talk
17) "He appears to be only a messenger." Wow. So DOJ official passes along Clinton oppo to FBI, from a discredited source. Doesn't tell that his wife is profiting from this venture. No big deal.  Just a "messenger." Imagine if official in Bush DOJ had done this to Obama team.
16) "And Bruce Ohr apparently spoke to Simpson on Aug. 22, according to phone logs reviewed by York." Doesn't note it was Simpson that demanded a call. Also slipped in late in piece, like no big deal, rather than back in main timeline describing Simpson outreach to Ohr.
15)"The two men had had a continuing discussion about Russian oligarch Oleg Deripaska in 2016" Again, that "discussion" involved a foreign national (Steele) lobbying DOJ official. At end we hear only that Steele was "concerned" re Deripaska. no description of his requests.
14) "Steele and Ohr had been in contact before the election, though it’s unclear how much Ohr knew about Steele’s work for Fusion." Um, maybe a fair amount, given all the summer contact between Steele, Simpson and Ohr? Why downplay it?
13)"But Steele and Simpson did not know that" Really? How can Fact Checker make such a claim? Steele was in continuous contact with high ranking DOJ official, who could easily have apprised him on probe. Steele also had contacts in FBI and in State Dept.
12) that Simpson was in touch with Ohr months earlier, at start of Trump-Russia probe. Specifically, an email to Ohr from Simpson in August reads: "Can u ring." Which is a pretty familiar way to email someone you rarely talk to.
11) "Simpson said Steele suggested he speak to Ohr after the “very surprising” victory by Trump." This statement, and quote that follows, make it sounds like Simpson's outreach was just a casual, "let me do the right thing" moment AFTER the election. But it omits...
10) "Bruce Ohr and Steele knew each other, apparently because of organized-crime issues." Maybe. But their relationship in early 2016 was Steele lobbying Ohr on behalf of Russian oligarch, about visas and sanctions. Important "fact," right? (gets slipped in at end of piece)
9) "(Bruce Ohr’s 278e financial disclosure form lists her as an “independent contractor.”)" This bland statement (i am assuming purposely) omits the key point: That this description masked where she really worked--Fusion--which Ohr should have disclosed, but didn't.
8) (I thought fact checkers existed to question unsupported claims?)
7)"the probe into the Trump campaign originally was sparked by a separate matter that Steele never wrote about." So says the FBI. But it notably won't provide any docs to back this up, and only came up with the Papadopoulos story after dossier was exposed.
6)"the dossier is actually several memos, based on conversations with Russian sources" Well, so says Steele and Glenn Simpson (Fusion GPS cofounder). fact checker just takes their word for it. But some suspect a few non Russians might have had some input.
5) "Steele, a former British intelligence officer with ties to the FBI and the U.S. intelligence community." Noble Steele, right? Only fails to note he looks also been working for/helping a Russian oligarch, even as he wrote dossier hyping Trump-Russia. Goes to credibility, no?
4)"Ohr is less of a central player." The guy was among highest ranking DOJ officials. And anybody who works for one central player in this drama (DOJ) and has dozens of contacts with all the other central players (Fusion, FBI, Steele) is by definition pretty central.
3)--whose wife worked for Clinton oppo-research group Fusion GPS--was feeding said oppo research to the FBI. And that the FBI was taking it even after having officially terminated Fusion employee Christopher Steele as a source, for breaking FBI rules.
2)"Ohr exists in a netherworld — a subject of fascination in right-leaning media". Right, though piece fails to note that is because mainstream media is more "fascinated" by Omarosa than it is the news that a high ranking DOJ official--
1) It is never fun to tackle fact checkers, but this one is a case study in that modern art of omitting details, stating unsupportable assertions as fact, slipping things in, manipulating a narrative. Opinion as "fact." So let's go through it. 	https://t.co/Z7r31OdbyW
Also, who precisely knew about this, and signed off? These things don't just "happen." This is about more than just Ohr. It is about any official in DOJ/FBI that allowed it.	 https://t.co/XpDiz79dAi via @WSJOpinion

On the question of Strzok's bias and whether we should believe he didn't act on it. The question every American should ask is this: How would you feel if he'd expressed such disgust toward you, and was also investigating you?
Huh. A congressman is actually asking questions, and a witness is actually answering--with no interruptions. Oh wait, that's right. It is a Democrat doing the asking, and Republicans showing respect for his time. #strzoktestimony
90-minute takeway from Strzok hearing: Democrats have forged new strategy for shutting down oversight. Interrupt, call points of order, argue over points of order, demand recorded votes, eat up time, protect the witness. Hope Republicans are taking notes.
And Representative Eric Swalwell (D., Non Sequiter) brings up ... Steven Bannon!
Strzok takes "great offense" that anyone might think that what he wrote was what he meant--that his bias against Trump was bias. Can't make this stuff up.
Anyone think Democrats look a little desperate to make sure Peter Strzok doesn't have to answer any questions? Wonder what they fear.
Did Strzok use the "ongoing investigation" excuse when he gave private testimony? Presumably not. So why is it now valid to avoid questions?
Sounds like the person who should be in that witness chair is Christopher Wray, to answer why the FBI has told Strzok to obstruct Congressional inquiries.
And how did that Papadopoulos info come in to FBI? It didn't come from official channels--Five Eyes intelligence. Did it come via the Obama (ex-Clinton) State Department?
When did that information about Papadopoulos really come in? The meeting in London was in May. FBI didn't start investigation (based on that meeting) until end of July. Did they sit on it? Only go back to it when they decided they wanted to get a FISA warrant?
Also, when did he know who was behind the dossier? (Comey claimed ignorance on this info.) What interaction, if any, did he have with Simpson and Fusion GPS? What role did Bruce/Nellie Ohr play in this?
@RepJerryNadler highlights just one of the pervasive problems with special counsels. According to him, Congress is not allowed to conduct in any way its constitutional duty of oversight so long as Mueller is in business. Crazy (if convenient for Democrats).

8) And I can still hear the echo of the howls from when Trump fired Comey. Still waiting to hear the apologies now that this report has backstopped the Rosenstein memo and the obvious grounds for dismissal.
7)It also contains stunning examples of incompetence. Comey explains that he wasn't aware the Weiner laptop was big deal because he didn't know Weiner was married to Abedin? Then they sit on it a month, either cuz it fell through cracks (wow) or were more obsessed w/Trump
6) People failing to adhere to their recusals (Kadzik/McCabe). Lynch hanging with Bill. Staff helping Comey conceal details of presser from DOJ bosses. Use of personal email and laptops. Leaks. Accepting gifts from media. Agent affairs/relationships.
5) Also don't believe anyone who says this is just about Comey and his instances of insubordination. (Though they are bad enough.) This is an indictment broadly of an FBI culture that believes itself above the rules it imposes on others. #IGReport
Insane indeed. And isn't just volume. Also finds: "FBI employees improperly received benefits from reporters, including tickets to sporting events, golfing outings, drinks and meals, and admittance to nonpublic social events." 	https://t.co/fT0DhipHV8
4) Meanwhile this same cast of characters who the IG has now found to have made a hash of the Clinton investigation and who demonstrate such bias, seamlessly moved to the Trump investigation. And we're supposed to think they got that one right? #IGReport
3) But he in fact finds bias everywhere. The examples are shocking and concerning, and he devotes entire sections to them. And he very specifically says in the summary that they "cast a cloud" on the entire "investigation's credibility." That's pretty damning. #IGReport
2) It means he didn't catch anyone doing anything so dumb as writing down that they took a specific step to aid a candidate. You know, like: "Let's give out this Combetta immunity deal so nothing comes out that will derail Hillary for President." #IGReport
1) Don't believe anyone who claims Horowitz didn't find bias. He very carefully says that he found no "documentary" evidence that bias produced "specific investigatory decisions." That's different  #IGReport

4) The cleanest way out of this is for the WH to declassify everything. The DOJ/FBI/Intelligence community has forfeited its arguments about classification, given its willingness to blow a source so that it could spin a story. Let the chips fall.
3) And especially knowing the facts we do--FISA warrants, spies/informants, dossiers paid for by a rival campaign--we should absolutely ask the investigators questions. The notion that the White House can't do this, because it was the target of said investigators, is nonsense.
2) The notion that the most powerful people in the land--law enforcement and intelligence services--should never be questioned, that their version should be accepted as fact, is antithetical to our system.

The FBI Informant Who Wasn’t Spying https://t.co/gnsibmHvta via @WSJOpinion
@RosemarieMaats1 @ChuckRossDC I should have been more clear. This first IG report is about the FBI's handling of the Clinton affair. But the IG recently announced that he would commence an investigation into the FBI's handling of Trump-Russia probe. So he's working on it.
@pfeiffer_gail There is pressure on DOJ to comply with the latest Nunes subpoena and turn over information on FBI human spying on Trump campaig. It's to get ahead of what comes out.
RT @Jim_Jordan: It’s high time for transparency. The DOJ and FBI have continually and repeatedly thwarted congressional oversight. We’re as…
FBI didn't tell FISA court who paid for it; Obama politicals unmasked transition members; Steele was blabbing to the press; etc. ad nauseum. In each instance, reporters of said news were deridingly dismissed as fantasists. Yet each of these items is now fact. (And more.)
1) True, and that's not all. Remember when it was conspiratorial and nut-jobby to report that: dossier was paid for by Democrats; dossier was paid for specifically by Clinton campaign; FBI used dossier in FISA application; https://t.co/8qO3PEUIlC
Kindly-meant memo to all: coming IG report does not deal with the FBI’s handling of Trump-Russia probe. Is focused solely on FBI Clinton email. Just so folks know IG report not likely behind DOJ spying admissions. And just so folks manage expectations.

@jaketapper @mchastain81 @Dflorill I totally did get it wrong! Need to take a break from the phone and just turn on The Stones. Thank you for the correction.
New NYT story includes gov leakers who confirm what we reported Friday: DOJ/FBI used ("at least" one!) human source to spy on Trump campaign. NYT: "And at least one government informant met several times with Mr. Page and Mr. Papadopoulos, current and former officials said." https://t.co/uvYuw4G9n2
8. On that, if u r wondering who narrated this story, note paragraphs that assure everybody that hardly anybody in DOJ knew about probe. Oh, and Comey also was given few details. Nobody knew nothin'! (Cuz when u require whole story saying u behaved, it means u know you didn't.)
7. As for whether to believe line that FBI operated soberly/carefully/judiciously in 2016, a main source for this judgment is, um . . .uh . . . Sally Yates. Who was in middle of it all. A bit like asking Putin to reassure that Russia didn't meddle in our election.
6. Now NYT tells us FBI didn't debrief downer until August 2nd. And Nunes says no "official intelligence" from allies was delivered to FBI about that convo prior to July 31. So how did FBI get Downer details? (Political actors?) And what really did inspire the CI investigation?
5. Back in Dec., NYT assured us it was the Papadopoulos-Downer convo that inspired FBI to launch official counterintelligence operation on July 31, 2016. Which was convenient, since it diminished the role of the dossier. However . . .
4. DOJ/FBI (and its leakers) have shredded what little credibility they have in claiming they cannot comply with subpoena. They are willing to provide details to friendly media, but not Congress? Willing to risk very source they claim to need to protect?
3. In self-serving desire to get a sympathetic story about its actions, DOJ/FBI leakers are willing to provide yet more details about that "top secret" source (namely, that spying was aimed at Page/Papadopoulos)--making all more likely/certain source will be outed. That's on them
2. Biggest takeaway: Govt "sources" admit that, indeed, the Obama DOJ and FBI spied on the Trump campaign. Spied. (Tho NYT kindly calls spy an "informant.") NYT slips in confirmation far down in story, and makes it out like it isn't a big deal. It is a very big deal.
1. So a few important points on that new NYT "Hurricane Crossfire" piece. A story that, BTW, all of us following this knew had to be coming. This is DOJ/FBI leakers' attempt to get in front of the facts Nunes is forcing out, to make it not sound so bad. Don't buy it. It's bad.

Key part of interview: @Comey admits he'd absolutely have removed Strzok/Page for bias, and then struggles to then claim their work product is still valid. Admits its a "fair question." Won't admit he doesn't have any reasonable answer.  #SpecialReport
Of course McCabe's lies and leak have helped "tear down" the FBI, sowing yet more distrust in it. "Accountability" matters, but that's after the fact. @Comey won't explain how he continues to praise a deputy who broke all Comey's standards of integrity/honesty. #SpecialReport
Actually is stunning overall amount the head of the FBI claims to not have known. Didn't know Steele's name; didn't know he lied to the FBI and was dismissed; didn't know who funded dossier; didn't know who leaked it. You gotta ask: Maybe he didn't want to know? #SpecialReport
#SpecialReport It is stunning that @Comey says he never bothered to find out who specifically funded the dossier. That didn't matter to FBI? Stunning too that he still doesn't know that Republicans had no part in the dossier-funding itself.
@BretBaier is rocking this Comey interview. Asking the real questions. @Comey is doing a lot of dodging ("it was a judgment call" "I didn't know""the decision of [name someone else] was to...") and is more than a little defensive about the word "leak."

@rothschild_eric @bvdees Actually, you are just wrong.

Nowhere does it state that this only applies when interfering with investigation. It is blanket.

9) You claim Rosenstein memo was "pretext" to fire you. Yet you don't address its specific claims. Please point to the policy that gives you authority to usurp DOJ leaders. Please provide examples of similar FBI press conferences. Please address criticisms of prior AGs/deputy AGs
8) You say you leaked your memos because it was material that needed to "be out in the public square." Under that standard, any current or former government employee is allowed to leak any material that they judge important. Is that your view?
7)You have strong views on lying. The IG has now said McCabe lied, at least three times under oath. Should he be prosecuted? If not, how do you explain the double standard of FBI's treatment of average citizens, and treatment of its own?
6) The texts suggest early coordination between FBI and political operatives in the Obama Administration. Who all knew about the dossier? Did you hear about it not just from Steele, but internally? Was the president informed of your ongoing work? What role did Brennan play?
5) The texts ridicule AG Lynch's decision to step aside from Clinton probe, "since she knows no charges will be brought." This was prior to FBI even interviewing Clinton. Please explain.
4)Given the duo's senior roles, and given clear text evidence that politics played a role in decisions (ie, how much manpower to use on Clinton investigation, given she might be "next president") how do reassure public of the integrity of either the Clinton or Trump probes?
3) What was the "insurance policy" to which Strzok and Page referred? Anonymous sources claim it meant simply the need to aggressively probe Russia, but it could also be read as a plan to harm Candidate Trump. Was it?
2) You've surely now read the Strzok-Page texts. Is this appropriate FBI behavior? Is this common FBI behavior? Can or how should the American public have confidence in a bureau that employs senior players with that behave in such a way?
1)Yet a few more questions Comey should be asked:

RT @RealJamesWoods: One of a million reasons I love the #NHL https://t.co/gmdoDAkmR3
Woohoo! 	 https://t.co/o88ZKlMgHc via @usatoday
17) It seems many of your decisions factored in politics. IE you note expecting Clinton to win, worry of "illegitimate" prez. Does this not run directly counter to DOJ policy, which specifically states: "politics must play no role in the decisions of federal investigators"?
16)You justify your numerous releases of FBI information on grounds that each met high bar of serving "public interest." Yet you saw no "public interest" in confirming publicly what you'd told Trump privately--that he was not under investigation?
15) You say you believe in "chain of command" and note how you followed AG Lynch's instructions even on questionable issues (like that "matter"). How do you explain your contrasting dismissal of AG Sessions authority, and your decision to conceal vital information from him?
14) Please discuss Andrew McCabe and that IG report that finds he lied repeatedly--both to you and about you. Do you still believe he "stood tall" as you Tweeted in Jan? Or is he one of the "small people" helping "tear down" an institution?
13)Also on lying: FBI usually interviews witnesses up front, to see if they lie at start. Why did u not interview Clinton until after whole YEAR of work, and after you'd made judgement? U say impt FBI treats everyone same. Why all the special Hillary interview accomodations?
12) Again, given your strong feelings about lying: Why did the FBI never take any follow up action against Huma Abedin, whose statements to FBI are at odds with emails FBI possessed?
11)You say what mattered was dossier's central "premise"--that Russia attempted to interfere in election. Can you name a time in modern history where Russia wasn't doing that? So why then give special credence to a politically motivated, salacious dossier?
10)You admit dossier still "unverified" at the time you were fired. Yet you used specific unverified claims in it (Page) as basis of FISA warrant four times. Explain.
9)You say nobody should ever lie to FBI. If Mr. Steele did lie, why has he not been prosecuted?
8)The FBI must've known the fall news stories--particularly Yahoo News--came from Steele. Sourcing was obvious. Yet you told FISA court your "credible" source had not talked to media. Either u didn't follow up on stories before going to court, or Steele lied to you. Which?
7)Steele (by his own admission) handed info to FBI and then briefed press--despite having been told not to Are these the actions of a "credible" source? Does it concern you that your "credible" source blew open to the public your investigation?
6)You claim the "effort" was originally financed by a Republican source. You are aware, correct, that the actual dossier effort was only ever financed by the DNC and Clinton campaign?
5) Did you ask Steele who had ultimately hired him? If he claimed to not know wouldn't that be worrisome--that a "credible" source (and former spy!) was willing to work for/benefit an unknown client? If by contrast he refused to tell you, doesn't that undercut credibility?
4)You say you knew dossier was funded by a "Democrat-aligned" group but you never knew which one. Why on earth not? Did FBI truly not care where info came from? Who was paying for it? Doesn't this go direct to source credibility?
3)Did you know Mr. Steele had been hired by Fusion GPS? Did FBI do any due diligence on Fusion, and discover its long record of being hired to dirty the reputations of its clients' political foes? If not, why not?
2)You repeatedly note the "source" of the dossier (Steele) was "credible." Does the FBI routinely view as "credible" sources hired by political operatives? You say Steele had a "track record" but did fact he was now working for politicals--in an election year--not concern you?
1)A few questions @Comey should have been asked--but wasn't:

exactly. my point on the double standard. https://t.co/7i0ZyEtu7k
2/ Fire Mueller, and you get a new special counsel, who will continue the work, with pressure to be even more "thorough." Trump would be wiser to focus on reassembling a crack legal term--versed in constitutional issues--that politely but aggressively protects him and pushes back
1/ All those calling for firings might consider the futility-counterproductivity of such moves. Fire Sessions and you have Rosenstein. Fire them both, and you have solicitor general (unnknown quantity on this issue), since Congress unlikely to approve new AG.
Quite aside from all the accommodations made to Mills (laptops, meetings), if FBI wanted to know Clinton's intent/knowledge of lack of server security, easiest way would have been to have seized Mills privileged interactions with her. But of course, it didn't.
There is an undeniable double standard between the deference shown Cheryl Mills during Clinton investigation and FBI's treatment of Cohen.

And for the record, I acknowledge Pruitt has also tallied some domestic security costs. But if you were facing daily death threats, your security detail might also think it best that you fly first class. No?
"Therefore, entering into the lease was consistent with federal ethics regulations regarding gifts, and use of the property in accordance with the lease agreement did not constitute a gift a defined in those regulations." 	And you are welcome, for all these facts.

4/ Meanwhile, here is the direct quote from memo issued from EPA principal deputy general counsel Kevin Minoli on March 30:
3/ McCarthy in 2014	--Vancouver: 62k (btw, it's impressive to spend that much just getting to Canada)	--Vietnam: 68k		McCarthy in 2013	--China: 55k		Jackson in 2012		--Israel: 65k		Jackson in 2011	--Rio De Janeiro: 60k	--Montreal: 51k	--China: 156k (wow).

1/ Mr. Eisen, actually, no. Wrong on all counts. 	Pruitt travel/security costs for 2017: $160k	Gina McCarthy travel/security costs for 2013-16: $630k	Lisa Jackson travel/security costs for 2009-12: $332k	Coming up next, the breakout for their trips... https://t.co/uLhArnzkoI
This Pruitt flap is absurd. Obama EPA officials spent as much or more on travel. And career EPA ethics officials say he paid "reasonable market value" for the condo, and leasor had no business in front of EPA. The press might at least try to pretend it didn't have two standards.
According to CDC, car crashes are leading cause of death for teens. In 2015, it killed 2,333 teens; sent another 235k to the emergency room. Far outstrips anything else, including shootings. Yet nobody proposes raising driving age to 21. https://t.co/8e6aQylT96

@48erfan1 that's also an idea.
I totally appreciate the skepticism. But why more faith in special counsel? Any pick would likely be an alum of DOJ/FBI/judicial world and just as conflicted. Plus, any SC--no matter how sterling--would immediately be trashed by Ds, in order to undermine findings. https://t.co/uNMdQqvp8N
The other thing that needs to happen is that Congress needs to start reasserting its authority. If agencies don't hand over material by deadlines, or play games with redactions, Congress needs to start passing out contempt and/or impeachment votes.
The Sessions letter says Huber also reports to him (the AG), and Sessions notes he is getting regular updates. https://t.co/GF4wIGB0TJ
The overlooked importance of the Sessions letter: It is official acknowledgment--by highest ranking law enforcement officer-- that DOJ/FBI have big problems, so big as to require investigation. Important admission, as it makes real what Congressional GOP investigators have said.
Special counsels are bad news (see: every recent headline) and AG Sessions is right to stick to principle and not appoint 2nd one. Huber has all the same powers, even as he remains under DOJ authority. Combine with more Sessions pressure for disclosure, and this is best scenario.
Congress and Trump can fix the omnibus. Though it requires Congressional Republicans to remember their spending-restraint promises. 	 https://t.co/13tZ48FvmM via @WSJOpinion

@jxjarvix With respect, i made no comment here on FISA court approvals. My point goes to FBI's dealings with Congress. There can be no justification for redaction, yet somebody decided to keep this from Congress. This is an oversight question.
Why is FBI/DOJ making it hard to look at unredacted texts? Why has it still not allowed all Congress to see FISA documents? How does FBI explain initial refusal to let Grassley make public his Steele referral letter when later release showed no reason to censor? 2/2
FBI Wray should have to answer other questions: 1)Whose idea was it at FBI to redact Strzok/Page texts about relationship with a FISA court judge? On what grounds could you possibly justify redaction? Who signed off on hiding this from Congress? 1/2

@DiogenesLamp0 grassley referral notes that the fbi told the court Steele was credible because he had not spoken to the press. But even Steele has now acknowledged (under oath) that he broke fbi rules and did talk to media. So fbi provided false information (whether knowingly or unknowingly).

@mackammagic Please read the Grassley referral. "The Chairman, Ranking Member, and Subcommittee Chairman Graham were allowed to review a total of four FISA applications." And the referral quotes directly from them.
5) It provides evidence that Steele was getting information from the Clinton team itself! Via the State Department! So now, not only do we have a dossier based on unnamed shady Russians, but on Sidney Blumenthal. How much of this was engineered by the Clinton campaign from start?
4) It provides evidence that the FBI presented the FISA Court with materially false evidence, in the claim that Steele had not talked to the press. And then shows that even after Steele admitted under oath that he had, the FBI did not tell the FISA Court in its renewal.
3) It is proof that the FBI did not tell the Court the extraordinarily partisan provenance of the dossier.
2)It is confirmation that the FBI's FISA application relied on the dossier and a news article, and worse, on the credibility of a source in the employ of the Clinton campaign.
1) Why isn't the (mostly) unredacted Grassley memo front page news? Here's why: Because it confirms the Nunes memo and blows up the Schiff talking points (which the media ran with).

2) This is beyond dispute; Steele and Simpson have admitted to the media briefings. It's an embarrassment for the agency, and i'd wager that even those agents that support the overall investigation can't be happy their leadership allowed the FBI to be a pawn for a campaign.
1) One obvious takeaway from the Grassley referral: The FBI got utterly USED by the Clinton campaign. Steele and Fusion had barely handed off the dossier before they were out flagging the FBI's work to the media, ginning up headlines helpful to their client (Clinton campaign).

2)Have been in journalism all my life. Have never--never--seen the press corps fight so hard against transparency. Same media that after election wondered if it was out of touch with avg Americans, now ignoring the legit worries so many have about govt. accountability.
1) I've covered politics a long time. I've never--never--seen anything approaching the desperations Ds have to keep this memo quiet. And as we know that worry about law enforcement (Snowden/Manning) is not their biggest worry, this memo must be damning to the core.
I've never said it was the only source. What I'm saying is this: If they had to use the dossier, it means whatever they already had wasn't "evidence" enough. So the dossier was crucial. And it was a campaign document. And again, that's wrong. https://t.co/0Lz8u9LPla

@josephmagazine1 @RepJoeKennedy Not using kid gloves. It's important to step back and make an honest assessment. Ds know they need inroads with Trump votes, and this response was aimed at that--not #Resist or offensive. The question is will the claim "we are you" will work. Rs had best pay attention.
I admire the breadth of the outreach of @RepJoeKennedy--an attempt to appeal to those blue-collar Trump voters. And it was very wise not to wade into the Russia debate. The question is whether voters buy his argument about "bullies" or see this Administration as liberating.
Joe Kennedy: "We choose both." Who doesn't? I just heard in Trump speech about tax cuts for all taxpayers, military protection for all citizens, deregulation that helps all businesses and workers, and a govt. willing to help those truly in need.   #SOTU
I start watching the D response with legitimate sympathy for @RepJoeKennedy A SOTU response is such an impossible job, in any year, in any party. And then he starts on "targeting the laws that protect us." Says the party that makes laws up as they go.  #SOTU
This was a "big" SOTU. So many are laundry lists. This was big thoughts on economy (taxes/deregulation/jobs). Big thoughts on foreign policy (bad guys vs American values). A few big bipartisan pitches going forward (infrastructure/immigration). And relentlessly optimistic.
Highlighting North Korean abuse. A refreshing approach, over cautious coddling. #SOTU
Good for Trump for proving willing to (first) highlight his desire for citizenship for Dreamers, and not give in to the nativist right. They will beat on him for this, but an ultimate deal is good for the country, and his administration. And that part is key.  #SOTU
First unfortunate note of the evening: Trump raises federal paid family leave.  #SOTU
Trump lays out an infrastructure $$ plan, but also wants permitting reform. That's an important part of a deal. What's the point of putting the money out if nothing gets built in 20 years? #SOTU
What we are seeing here is a Trump recounting of what his Administration has done this past year--which few in the media have chronicled. (Too busy obsessing on Mueller). But put altogether, the accomplishments are quite a list.  #SOTU
Deregulation has been as important at tax reform. Regs are an enormous, if hidden, tax. Made harder by the uncertainty that comes from arbitrary application of regs. The change has been 180, and huge.  #SOTU
It is good to see a president talk about accountability in government, and how that occasionally requires firing those in Washington who fail. Which is the standard in the private sector.  #StateofOurUnion

For all those calling on @RepDevinNunes to release the actual FBI documents: He can't. His committee was allowed to go view them, take notes, but does not have possession of them. Call on the FBI/DOJ to release them. And then ask why those agencies won't.
In a statement @ChuckGrassley says DOJ/FBI continue to restrict access to vital docs, continue to use phony "classification" issues to keep the Senate from releasing unclassified info about Christopher Steele. What do these folks have so desperately to hide?

@lniese @NBCNews I didn't see conspiracy or money laundering or anything else to do with Russia in there, either.
Striking that in all these "Trump-obstruction" stories no one is questioning the appropriateness of a special counsel (Mueller) and his team devoting their resources to the firing of a dear colleague and friend (Comey). Seems a bit close.
I keep reading this and reading this, and just can't find that word. You know the one. That word that inspired the entire special counsel probe. Collusion. 	 Mueller appears to be zeroing in on obstruction questions https://t.co/LTYeb0mPde via @nbcnews
So a Mueller team member tries to woo Strzok by fawning that he is "the second smartest lawyer she has ever worked with beside comey." And anyone thought Mueller's team was going to take an unbiased look at what happened in 2016, including FBI actions? Hardly.
Also, just imagine a mom-pop business is under IRS investigation and says, "whoops, sorry, can't find any financial records for those months." Anyone think the IRS would be understanding? Or do we think mom-pop would face losing their business? https://t.co/XBxVs5Fyun

There are certain facts (how much of the dossier did the FBI corroborate, if any? how was it used? when was it used? what did the FBI make of Steele?) that can only be definitively answered by personally seeing the FBI docs. How many commentators can claim they have? (Not I)
Prediction: A whole lot of people (who are making very bold statements about the specific facts of FBI evidence/actions/dossier/FISA warrant etc.) are going to have a whole lot of omelette on their faces when the actual documents are declassified.
Imagine if this had been President Bush listening in to an Obama campaign.
Not so long ago, left had a cow over “metadata”—which at least shields identities and is designed to go after bad guys. Now we know US gov was directly listening in on citizens who were part of a political campaign—and that’s ok?? The 180 is extraordinary.
And I’m still waiting for Shane to cite where I said that in my piece. https://t.co/4Xi9T0suMg
This is why it is so important to declassify everything possible. Let’s find the truth. Was it not an initial basis, but an ongoing rationale? Was it never cited?

The Dossier Rehab Campaign https://t.co/8NakR12OkG
@LimpTakes I suppose it is possible that Papadopoulos was an FBI source, but we have zero evidence to suggest so, and plenty of evidence (a plea deal) to suggest not.
@LimpTakes I think the implication is that Simpson was referring all along to the outside Australian diplomat that tipped the FBI to Papadopoulos, but that he purposely phrased it to sound like the FBI had an internal Trump source. Because that sounded better.
@LimpTakes oddly big, uh, slip up. The purpose of his testimony was to legitimize the dossier, and what better way to do it than to suggest the FBI had same info as the dossier--but had got it from an internal Trump source? That would be huge. Only, not true.
Everyone understands "source" means someone who talks to you, and the deliberate implication was that somebody inside Trump world was talking to FBI. Now we find out that "source" means somebody outside campaign (diplomat) talking about a probe TARGET (papadopoulos)?
To believe that this was a "mischaracterization, you have to believe that Simpson, ace reporter, does not know the definition of a "source." His language in testimony and in oped was similar: FBI had other intelligence, including from "an internal Trump campaign source." https://t.co/IDP0nkMu8P
@garytcosta Good golly. For the millionth time:  Clinton’s law firm hired Simpson to research trump history, and as part of that (funded by Hillary) simpson hired Steele to do the dossier part. Simpson himself says so.

4. Now remember that Browder himself did accept the Committee's invitation, and answered all their questions, under oath, in public. So who is hiding and who is dodging? 	5. And with all THAT, now reread the Simpson transcript--with that sense of his credibility in mind.
3. With that mind, remember that Simpson dodged two invitations to testify in public setting next to Browder. And after Simpson was subpoenaed, responded that he'd plead the 5th to every question rather than testify in a public setting.
Another thought on Simpson testimony: 	1. Testimony stands or falls on witness credibility. 	2. With that in mind, go read page 44, in which Simpson accuses a target, Bill Browder, of dodging Russia questions, and describes his own efforts to force said testimony in heroic terms

10 Takeaways From Glenn Simpson's Fusion GPS Senate Testimony https://t.co/PsZwE99JBi
It is time to release absolutely everything related to the dossier that can be legitimately declassified. The spin has become silly.
Short summary of the Simpson testimony/release: 	Committee: Please explain why we should believe the 3rd-hand gossip that makes up the Steele "dossier"?	Simpson: Here is a bunch more 3rd-hand gossip to corroborate the 3rd-hand gossip! 	Media: Simpson proves dossier is true!
Dear Adam Schiff, Please explain how Democrats are in favor of ignoring states when it comes to most federal grounds, but in favor of states rights when it suits them. And please explain how offshore drilling would do anything to your coastlines. Please. Please again. https://t.co/0Uj3BK9QBn
@gail_cotten @tklough @TomFitton She certainly hasn’t helped her cause—assuming that is finding the truth. This unauthorized release will give other witnesses legit cause to refuse to come give testimony. And who remains to be interviewed? Jared Kushner.
Also, why did Simpson correct his claim about a walk-in source through media? Shouldn’t he have officially informed the committee of this error?
Funny. Ds release Simpson transcript to make case the dossier wasn't central. Libs pounce all over Simpson's claim that FBI already had a "source" within Trump world, and say THAT is why GOP was hiding transcript. Simpson then says, uh, never mind. And leaves them hanging.
Well it is hard to know, because he keeps changing what he says. See pages 175 versus pages 195-196. And Simpson refused to answer about whether he knew the name. https://t.co/TeWZPequhU
So, wait: In other words, nobody from within Trump camp went seeking out the FBI? So much for that narrative. And also: A "source close" to Simpson says he mislead the committee? https://t.co/7CZ389y1F0
That is an excellent point. The wording is really weird, and could in fact mean FBI was looking at someone in Trump campaign. Hmmm. https://t.co/XgdcoalCpa
No one will publicly say, because no one is supposed to talk about FISA. But i think we can assume that if House Intelligence says it now has what it needs, that means it has seen what matters so far. https://t.co/JQhensteyE
While I've been a huge fan of publicly releasing the Simpson testimony, @SenFeinstein has done the process no favors by doing it unilaterally. She's freed the GOP to do the same with other papers/testimony.
Really? Clinton campaign/DNC use its law firm to hire Fusion GPS. Fusion GPS subcontracts Steele. Go read Simpson's oped from a few days ago--as your source. Good grief. https://t.co/GZ8DCjpyx4
The issue isn't necessarily the FBI telling. It's the undisputed fact that those it was telling were connected to the (rival) Clinton campaign. And if it were reversed (FBI investigating Clinton, and telling Trump campaign about it) the left would (rightly) be melting down. https://t.co/KpQPiafXGX
That's not necessarily the case. Someone in the campaign might have reached out to the FBI. And that would be notable. Although also notable that the only person who has made that claim is Simpson, who says he got it from Steele... who refuses to give sworn testimony to Congress. https://t.co/lublCRZ5FZ
Or maybe the FBI stopped dealing with Steele. Does anyone suppose Steele told the FBI in September that he (an informant) was also briefing reporters on the dossier? Or that FBI would be happy about that? https://t.co/rvy7fQmAxJ
And as you read Fusion's (Simpson's) testimony about Steele, also bear in mind the Grassley/Graham referral of Steele for a Justice Dept criminal investigation. Which suggests evidence that Steele wasn't straight up with FBI (or maybe even Fusion).
If true, that means FBI was blabbing to Steele--(who was on the payroll of the Clinton campaign)--about separate intelligence it had on Trump--including another informant's name. And that Steele then told a political operative (Simpson). Hope that's not how it really works. https://t.co/HEpFRiidIn
Impt to remember what House Intel is looking at now. Finally got ahold of 1023 forms. 1023s document the info exchanged and interaction between FBI agents and their confidential human sources. Steele was a source. Notable that FBI fought so hard against turning 1023s over.
Amusing. Fusion GPS can't keep its own spin straight. In Jan 2 NYT oped, it says its Steele dossier wasn't the "trigger" for FBI Trump-Russia probe. 3 days later its lawyer complains GOP is dogging the very guy (Steele) who told FBI about Trump-Russia ties in "first place"

That's irrelevant. Clapper issued the intelligence community assessment in Jan 2017, which found nothing that rose to collusion. The agencies all contributed, and FBI/Comey signed off on report. If Pappa was that big, FBI wud've brought to Clapper's attention. https://t.co/Ewa7HDUh0D
I'm not sure how asking the FBI and DOJ to simply be transparent about their actions during the election is over-the-top. Rather, it's a bit over-the-top to suggest FBI/DOJ are beyond oversight.

With respect, the question isn't just Strzok's role in the Mueller probe--and obviously it is good Mueller removed him. It is his, and FBI's, role prior to Mueller, vis a vis the dossier and CI probe into Russia. https://t.co/kBq6LEbavV
Rosenstein explains difference between agents having "opinions" (OK) and "bias" (not OK). Mueller's decision to fire Strzok therefore indicates Mueller saw bias. Bias from a lead agent on both Clinton/Trump probes.
Press is focusing (deliberately) on Strzok texts expressing hostility to Trump, and noting it is OK for agents to have political opinions. Press needs to to focus on the messages suggesting he'd act on that hostility ("insurance policy")--which is not OK.

Totally agree with Obama about civic engagement. Lace up your shoes, grab a clipboard. Yes. Best part of speech.
LOL. Live listening to Obama talk about the problems of $$ in politics. He broke all records. He is on office because of big bucks.
The fundamental conceit of Obama has always been his claims that we are only good Americans if we believe as he does. So hectoring.

Wallace: Please explain the two positions you have on borders. Clinton: Wikileaks sucks! Russia is evil! #debatenight
Hillary says govt. has "no business" in abortion. Interesting to know there's a thing she thinks govt. has no business doing. #debatenight

1. Democrats love "dark money"-when it helps them. 2. "dark money" is a fraction of spending. 3. "dark money" protects donors. #debatenight

"Dark money" (protected money) is maybe 4% of election spending. It's a canard. Hillary wants to use it as an excuse to control speech.
I'd love to discuss that. But Democrats nominated her. Just as Republicans nominated him. https://t.co/TVZZqm85uM

"I was involved in those operations--highly classified ones." Yes, we know. As do all the hackers. #Debate
Women and a decent life. I really hope Trump brings up the Foundation donors from countries that sanction abuse of women. #debate
Hillary is talking about Trump "taking care of" friends? How many Clinton Foundation donors got special access/deals?
Clinton:  When I have two positions, i'm just following in the noble tradition of Lincoln. Pivot-to-Russia-and-tax-returns. #debate
Laugh. Out. Loud. https://t.co/nJxttn2q4g
@felixsalmon Agreed. Did himself no favors, interrupting.
Hillary mentions twice now that many get healthcare from employers. Wants to think the ObamaCare mess is just a "slot" of nation. #debate
Hillary talks about the few "upsides" of ObamaCare. Not a single answer about how she'd fix the coming death spiral. Non-answer. #debate
What part of Trump's email points are "not true"? Would love for Clinton have to explain.
The best Hillary can now say is that there is no evidence anybody hacked her account and no classified leaked out? Quite a shift. #debate
Wow. Hillary is smugly smiling during this discussion of her having mishandled classified info and deleted public records. #debate
Again, putting Trump aside: The idea that Hillary "goes high" is  laughable. She's run one of the most vicious campaigns ever #debate
The moderators are already doing themselves damage, by interrupting him.... #debate
Putting Trump entirely aside: Hillary Clinton is unfit to serve. She is unethical, corrupt, and has a disdain for the truth. #debate
Finally, finally, Trump talks about ObamaCare!! #debate
Does calling half of America "deplorable" count in Clinton's book as "lifting people up?" #debate

Notice this routine? Pence says something generous about Kaine. Kaine, gives one word agreement: "yes" "indeed." "mutual."  #VPDebate
Nearly ever complaint abt Trump Foundation brought by NY AG, who is Clinton supporter, donor, and sits on her leadership council. #VPDebate
Yes, the Clinton Foundation does what Kaine says. But doesn't mean it doesn't ALSO and primarily exist to benefit Clintons. #VPDebate

Kaine: Russia=Tump taxes. 	Kaine clearly studied at Joe Biden school of VP debating. #VPDebate
Amazing. Why doesn't Elaine Qiuijano challenge Kaine that U.S. has stopped Iranian nuclear program? It's a worldwide joke.
Good grief. Kaine is sounding (Trump doesn't pay taxes) like a phonographic record in an earthquake. #VPDebate
Funny, you'd have thought Kaine would say that. But he didn't. #VPDebate https://t.co/52SBb1gzqq
@caroline44441 Awww, thank you. That is really kind.
Kaine: "You don't get to decide the rights and wrongs... We have a Justice system." Uh, do we? Comey/Justice gave Hillary a pass.
Kaine just talked for minutes about "intelligence surge" but still have no idea what that means. Alliances? What does that mean?
First moderator question of note: What exactly does a Clinton "intelligence surge" look like? (Especially given Dems hate surveillance?)
Pence: "That nation [irag] was secured in 2009" but "we are back at war." A simple but profound explanation of Obama's failures.
Pence: Fabulous! "Ours is an insult-driven campaign???" Basket of deplorables? #VPDebate
Kaine (essentially):  If you don't agree with me on the police question, it means you are scared to discuss "bias." #VPDebate Really.
Fav Democrat line today: "I'm a gun owner, but . . . " Thankfully, Founding Fathers didn't say, Here's the Bill of Rights, but . #VPDebate
Hmm. Life before FDR (according to Kaine). Be a Sunday school teacher, retire into poverty. #VPDebate
Good point: Trump made lots of money, and created jobs. Hillary made lots of money, and created herself and an offgrid server. #VPDebate
Pence: "If you think that's all working .... " Excellent line. "People in Scranton know different."
Nice to hear Pence talk about Obama's executive orders. Trump would do well to hit the extralegality of Obama a lot harder. #VPDebate
Pence: "And Iraq has been overrun by ISIS." Confused look by Kaine, followed by brag that we have fewer troops there. #VPDebate
Tim Kaine, 15 minutes in, risks like looking like an interrupting, aggressive ankle biter. #VPDebate
Tim Kaine: Honest. Hillary Clinton since a child has had a "passion"--to rule the country.

In a very long speech, words that never left Bill's mouth: email; server; Benghazi; Clinton Foundation; Wall Street; speeches.
One clever aspect of Bill speech: The focus on Hillary-the-person let him ignore ideological divide between centrist Bill and far-left Hill
RT @BoltsLee: I need the laughs today! Love it! https://t.co/nKsrm2Dv1u
Surprise! No mention of a Foundation that has made Hillary beholden to authoritarian countries; giant companies; wealthy influence peddlers.
RT @marykissel: Why interrupt this blissful reverie with awkward truths? https://t.co/5hOflX2Tyn
Bill: "What the difference with Republican convention"? Hmmm. Nobody mishandled classified national secrets. For a start.
Or if he mentions the friends of Clintons who financially benefited from Foundation money?
Or will he mention all the companies who donated to Foundation even as they were lobbying the State Department? #DemsInPhilly
Bets on whether Bill mentions her charitable work at the Foundation? All those "big money" donations from such lovely countries.

"I really want you to marry me, but you shouldn't." Striking honesty from Bill. Although it overlooks Hillary's own ambition. #DemsInPhilly
Curious: How many Americans believe Hillary did early work out of conviction, and how many think she did it out of pure upward ambition?
