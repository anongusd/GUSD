And @SenDuckworth called the bill nothing more than a "political stunt"
Also, there's *obviously* already a law that addresses this.		Per @maziehirono : "It is, and always has been, a crime not to" provide medical care a hypothetical infant in this situation.
From @PPFA 's prez Leana Wen: "This legislation is based on lies and a misinformation campaign, aimed at shaming women and criminalizing doctors for a practice that doesn't exist in medicine or reality,"
According to @Guttmacher this practice literally *DOES NOT EXIST* 		Per Elizabeth Nash: "When you're providing abortion care, this isn't something that happens"
Republicans -- including it's sponsor @SenSasse -- said that the bill was a straight-forward way to protect infants that survive botched abortions. That's not the whole story.
Monday's "born-alive" bill may have failed in the Senate on Monday, but the legislation signals something much bigger: a push by the conservative right to reframe the reproductive rights debate toward third-trimester abortions.		https://t.co/ZegCVg91BM
