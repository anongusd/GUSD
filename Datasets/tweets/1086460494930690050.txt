@RepGosar When will you gutless @GOP start to love the rule of law more than you people love a racist, con man and cheat like @realDonaldTrump? Follow the money. Follow the facts. This @POTUS is a criminal no matter what side you get outta bed in the morning.
@hardball @DavidAFrench Thats right. Because our scumbag congressman have certain protections inside the walls and halls on the Hill. But outside those walls are the REAL world that the rest americans live. Under the laws of the land. Where nobody is above the law.

@TheWilsonCenter @newsjean @wrightr The North Korean people watched the oversight hearings. They saw what kind of a man @realDonaldTrump is. They're laughing at the Americans. Mr. Kim may be Rocket man but we sent a indicted mobster to Vietnam. We have no credibility with North Korea or anyone else in the world.
@washingtonpost @seanhannity is a big mouthed insignificant American. He's unimportant to real people. People that are free thinking and very intelligent. These are people who do large amounts of reading. Hannity appeals to those who don't read, read very little or can't read at all.
@CNNPolitics @RepMarkMeadows is a liar. He's no different than @michaelcohen212 when it comes to lying. However Mr. Cohen proved yesterday that he's more of a man than Mark Meadows will ever be. Sad people @RepMarkMeadows represents.
@NAACP @RepMarciaFudge When it comes to Africans captured and brought to America, that makes it American history. Period. Said and done. One country, one history.
@LindseyGrahamSC looks like hell on tv today. @MichaelCohen told the @GOP that something terrible will happen to them if they continue to blindly follow this fake lying cheating racist @POTUS.
@ThisWeekABC Your so-called experts aren't experts at all. @realDonaldTrump got his ass kicked by the North Korean leader. All of North Korea is super proud of their leader. Unlike america who sent a mobster to Vietnam to negotiate peace. We are the laughing fools of the world. Like it or not
@Wakepedia @charliekirk11 No it doesn't! Thats the most absurd thing I've heard today. I'm sure tomorrow will have you beat. Furthermore since you're resighting something that comes from above. Try this. The borrower is a slave to the lender. Do you owe any money?
@MSNBC And you people call this normal, rational? If so you're just as nutty as @realDonaldTrump  is.

@MSNBC @NBCNews @KenDilanianNBC If everyone of you in the media wasn't so power hungry and thirsty for crap you could've been on top of this a year ago. This should not be a surprise. If you're out of New York you could've squashed this @POTUS 2-1/2 years ago. But your own greed for money &amp; power got in the way
@charliekirk11 Excuse me? It was the thirst for capitalism that fueled slavery. Not to mention the power, corruption and control that it created. You're so freaking lost inside your own head that nothing comes out of it that is even remotely close to the truth. So fools follow your crap.
@politico Did he say this to the face of Donald Trump? I doubt it. These @GOP are cowards. Every single one of them. They're worthless to their state, their districts and more importantly their families.
@realDonaldTrump has to take the word of our adversaries because if he didn't that would require him to think about what they did. And this would force him to take a look at himself. Its psychotic to say the least. @msnbc
@DonaldJTrumpJr your daddy said that you have the worst judgment of anyone in the world. Said Mr. Cohen. I believe him considering you left your wife to chase a Fox News flusy.
@RashidaTlaib You did an awesome good job. @RepMarkMeadows is a racist. Or a complete incompetent fool. No matter how much he begged @RepCummings to defend him. What a sorry pathetic congressman. Keep doing a great job. #FromAdifferentState than yours too.
@KamalaHarris @CoryBooker What we we need is more legislation to free those who was imprisoned for cannabis crimes.
@KamalaHarris @CoryBooker With all due respect Senator/candidate. Marijuana is already legal in your state of California. And California has the most retail stores, growers and dispensaries. So many so that your state is dangerously behind on renewal of these permits. We don't need more legalization.
@GOP Unlike you cowards @MichaelCohen212 changed his mind. In the America that I was born and raised in you are allowed to change your mind. You people are so pathetic and sad. Cohen told you. keep blindly drinking @realDonaldTrump kool-aid and see what happens to you. Think its a lie
@KH060708 @gsluper @Jim_Jordan @RepMarkMeadows If that's the only charge that you're aware of then you definitely don't belong in any of my discussions. My discussion are for informed individuals only. Please stay out with your opinions that lack facts.
@ThisWeekABC @KFaulders Don't y'all know @realDonaldTrump lied!? He has told 1000s of lies. And this comment/statement was just another lie. Stop drinking his kool-aid laced with his blood.
@AOC @RashidaTlaib She's right. I was able to watch this hearing in real time. That fool @RepMarkMeadows using this forum to defend himself was about as man-less as a man gets. In fact, to follow and kiss up to @realDonaldTrump requires you to surrender your manhood, or if you're a woman-womanhood.
@JudiciaryGOP @RodneyDavis Really!? We the real thinking and voting people know your record on guns. That's why we sent a new @HouseDemocrats to congress. You people are done. Get out!

@SarahHa80777264 @GOPoversight @RepMattGaetz If he is a slime ball its because he follow in the foot steps of the man he handled legal affairs for 10 years. If you work for a boss who steals, you're gonna steal because you think its okay. Duh? The fool begins with the reflection in the mirror.
What @RepMattGaetz was attempting to do to @MichaelCohen212 was show that he didn't care about his wife and children. Trying to paint an unfaithful picture of him. The @GOPoversight and the @OversightDems should bring charges against this sorry pathetic congressman.
@GOPoversight You should be going after @RepMattGaetz for witness tampering and intimidation.
@joniernst The 1.5 trillion dollar tax transfer was a project. Give it back.
@MichaelCohen212 correctly called @realDonaldTrump a racist, a con man and a cheat. This true, because his first act in office was to steal 1.5 trillion dollars from the tax payer and give it to himself and the county's riches people. And this what your @GOP is trying to protect?
@DonaldJTrumpJr @Jim_Jordan and @RepMarkMeadows better hear what @MichaelCohen212 told them. If they continue to blindly follow @realDonaldTrump they will face the same fate he's facing. That real talk. You of all people know this.
@realDonaldTrump went to Vietnam and got his ass kicked. I told y'all President Kim wasn't going to give up their life protections.
@GOP @GOPChairwoman did you know that pathological liars like @realDonaldTrump also suffer from self induced deafness? They hear things in conversations that nobody can hear except him. @MichaelCohen212 DID NOT say there was no collusion. You know what he said. #TRUE #TRUTH
@GOP I don't have any evidence either. But that doesn't mean that the proper investigators don't. How stupid are you on a scale of 1-1? But Michael did give a warning. He said if you continue to blindly follow @realDonaldTrump the same will happen to you that has happened to him.
@rolandsmartin He committed a crime. And should be treated like it is. A crime.
@mattgaetz @MichaelCohen212 I want you brought up on federal charges. You earned it and you deserve it. You are the problem with this country not a solution. I hope the proper committee make an example out of you. If every crime was over looked with an apology where would we be?

@mmfa Americans have not forgotten that @seanhannity and @MichaelCohen212 worked on a real estate deal.
@CBSNews Michael Cohen didn't give the @OversightDems a roadmap. That will come from the Mueller report. This was just the preliminary. To expose the complicity of the @GOPoversight.
@WhiteHouse Don't kid yourself. President Kim knows that this @POTUS is a criminal who has committed bank fraud, insurance fraud, tax evasion and other crimes. This is the new face of America? Mr. Kim is aware of the hearings held today also. He's laughing very hard at @realDonaldTrump.
@charliekirk11 That's not true. You're a liar.
@GOPLeader You don't really believe that do you? If you do you're unfit to hold office in our government. @realDonaldTrump is a con man. A criminal and mobster. The North Korean leader saw the hearing. He's not a fool. No way does this @POTUS have any leverage anymore.
@CBSNews After today's testimony before the house oversight committee its absurd that any news media organization like 50 plus year old CBS still consider @realDonaldTrump a president of this country. He's a con man. And the thing you should be saying is that President Kim knows this now.
@CNN Something like this could only happen under a divided United States Congress that has a criminal in the oval office. @realDonaldTrump
@SenDuckworth Its a well known fact that @realDonaldTrump has hire nothing but scumbags his entire life.
@mmfa It appears to me that sometimes the media goes out of its way to find the biggest idiots to put in front of the cameras. Think about Santorum's comment for a minute. I get nauseous listening to these liars.
@NewsHour There is not going to be a denuclearization. This whole summit is so that President Kim can tell @realDonaldTrump before the whole world what a weak criminal leader he is. But just like usual, the only deal will be begging Kim to make him look good.

The @GOP @GOPChairwoman @SenateGOP made a decision to sell their blood to @realDonaldTrump. That's why they can't change their mind now. They slit their wrist and put it up to Trump's lips and sucked their blood.
In all of my years I have never seen such weak men and women as I'm seeing in this @GOP @GOPoversight. A liar, crook, thief, con-man, school yard bully, punk like @realDonaldTrump always attracts and befriend people just like him. Look in the mirror boys &amp; girls.
@NewsHour @nickschifrin @JudyWoodruff I really don't know what you are expecting to come from this summit. North Korea is not giving up their nuclear program. Especially after what President Kim saw on the hill today. President Kim knows just like all of us that he's dealing with an American mobsters in @POTUS.
@AP North Korea has a human right to protect itself. Period.
@washingtonpost When will you start to investigate those @GOP members who are being complicit in @realDonaldTrump crimes? This is getting ridiculous.
@mattgaetz You broke the law. You tampered with a witness who was preparing to testify before a committee in congress. I hope you heard what Cohen said because you fit the description of somebody drunk on Trump's funky cologne. #Weakman

@charliekirk11 You people are pathetic. Truly pathetic. The sun will rise and set whether you believe it or not. The truth is the truth whether you believe it or not. This hearing is for @MichaelCohen212 to tell what he knows about that slimeball scumbag lying devil worshiper @realDonaldTrump.
@justinamash Let me answer that question for you sir. The reason why @realDonaldTrump would hire @MichaelCohen212 is the reason any criminal boss would. @realDonaldTrump is a scumbag and he wanted a scumbag lawyer.
There is a real Nation Security treat to America when the sitting President's party will not defend the American people against a mobster @POTUS.
@GOPChairwoman your @GOPoversight members are real clowns. What circus did you find these clowns from?

If you're a decent Republican you are ashamed of your @HouseGOP that are sitting on the @GOPoversight. I agree with #MichaelCohen that not one question has been asked about @realDonaldTrump by the Republicans. I'm an American voter and I demand that these @GOP ask questions #DJT.

@CongressmanHice To say to Mr. Cohen that if he lied makes him a liar makes you a liar too. Because every human living pass the the age of 2 has lied. You are liar sir.
The real problem @RepJim_Jordan and @RepMarkMeadows is that the head of this committee is a black man. Their faces are turning redder with each minute of this hearing.
@RepMarkMeadows Is another @GOP member who has more to lose than Michael Cohen when @realDonaldTrump is exposed. This @POTUS is going to prison. But @RepMarkMeadows have no morals anyway. None of the @GOP have any morals. How sad.
@KamalaHarris If you are the nominee the only way to beat @realDonaldTrump is to simply tell the truth about @realDonaldTrump. Just like Michael Cohen is doing today.
The @GOP have lost it. Mr. Cohen has admitted lying, cheating and is going to prison. We KNOW THAT. So stop attacking him. It is obvious that the @GOP and their wealthy donors have more to lose with an impeached/convicted @POTUS than 3 years of prison for Mr. Cohen.
@KYComer You @GOP are pathetic! You people have so much lying in your eyes. You people are have no idea what the truth looks like. Its proof that you're protecting a lying cheat con man like @realDonaldTrump
@Jim_Jordan I honestly feel sorry for the people in the district where you come from. To attack Michael Cohen's wrong doing is ignorant. Because he only acted like his mob boss acted. To see Michael Cohen you're seeing @realDonaldTrump.
@RepMarkGreen You have to got to be the most un-intelligent man in congress. Can't you understand that this man Michael Cohen is only acting like the hero he used to work for? He lied b/c @realDonaldTrump is liar. He didn't pay taxes b/c #DJT didn't pay taxes.
@GOP What is it about organized crime that you don't get? No wonder your party has become the scum of the earth. I doesn't surprise me that this party and Trump TV @foxandfriends follow this scum crime boss @realDonaldTrump you call @POTUS.

@charliekirk11 @BLEXIT If @RealCandaceO was really changing the game she would trying to brainwash ALL of the diversity of the @TheDemocrats voters. Not just the black people. I call that a con job with nothing but selfish self-serving interest of one confused black woman. She can't fool enough of us.
@RobbT__ @ofthehuns @charliekirk11 @AOC Obviously you are under informed. Under interested. Under educated about what Congress's function is. You're someone who's never been a staffer, never worked on the Hill. Don't know the function of a lobbyist. A true patriot would make it their business to learn these things. Bye
@charliekirk11 @AOC Again you continue to vomit up alternative information as if its fact. (Facts Always Create Truth Stupid) But you're more interested receiving your secret pay check from wherever dark money comes from. I'm glad there's not a diversity organization like the brainwashing @TPUSA.
@ofthehuns @charliekirk11 @AOC Congress has not had a raise in ten years. and the actual pay is $174,900.00.
Can anybody imagine a @POTUS presidential library filled with nothing but millions upon millions of tweets? Nothing else. No documents. Just a few photos of Clemson Tigers eating McDonalds.
@KamalaHarris True. But the other truth is that very few minimum wage workers rarely ever get the opportunity to work a full 40 hours a week consistently week after week. And those who do don't have paid leave.
The first thing @realDonaldTrump did in the oval office was give wealthy billionaires and corporations a down payment of $1.5 trillion toward his 2020 re-election campaign. And the first billionaire to public announce his the 1st payment is @HowardSchultz .#BoycottStarbucks
@TIME @HowardSchultz running for #POTUS is a billionaire's political scam. Its only objective is to distract @TheDemocrats voters to help @realDonaldTrump  re-election. And this ideal that he's independent is ridiculous. I'm calling for a nationwide #BoycottStarbucks till he quit.

@OANN @YouTube America's military has been deployed to the middle east since the 911 attacks. Why? To keep the terrorist from coming to America. So if America is serious about keeping drugs, rapist, gangs, traffickers, murderous out of America then why not also send the military to Mexico?

@realDonaldTrump With all undo-respect Mr. @POTUS our @FBI &amp; @DOJPH &amp; our criminal court lawyers and judges know 1,000,000 times more about who should be indicted than you do. Because they practice rule of law and facts to bring an indictment. Not some early morning hair brain tweet as evidence.

@OutnumberedOT @realDonaldTrump is about to deliver  his very condensed version of the #SOTU address. So don't y'all be surprised if this is exactly what this is. More untruths more deceptions and more raw meat to his base.
@OutnumberedOT Seriously y'all? This shutdown is another arrogant temper tantrum by @realDonaldTrump. And his only agenda was to try and bully the @HouseDemocrats and @SpeakerPelosi to show his disrespect of our elections and the Constitution. Call this for what it really is.
@OutnumberedOT @SenShelby @realDonaldTrump made an offer. The @SenMajLdr held votes on the floor. It was defeated. So the constitution gives congress the power to end this hostile government take over. When will you defend the constitution of the united states?
@OutnumberedFNC Please understand that this @potus is a failed business man, a terrible negotiator and a fake reality tv personality pretending to be president of the united states. You should know this after 735 days of this daily continuous circus.
@MikeBloomberg @DemBizNoVA I think that this shutdown is an attack on our nation by a @POTUS who was assisted by a foreign enemy of democracy. It is an act of treason and should be taken seriously. Since when does a @POTUS puts the lives of millions of non-military civilians in danger w/o any consequences?
@SenBlumenthal Our Constitution has given Congress the power to end this shutdown through Articles of Impeachment. The only question is does #Congress have the guts to apply it to this @POTUS. Do a major lost of life have to happen first? The whole nation has been put at danger. Don't wait!
@OutnumberedFNC Please understand that when 29 @FBI agents with 17 vehicles show up at your house to arrest you you're likely 99.9% guilty. Most Americans are used to @FBI busting drug dealers and dangerous criminals. Don't be fooled by money &amp; fancy suits. He's guilty. #Prison
@OutnumberedFNC I don't think that the @FBI consider anyone connected to the attack by Russia on our country a white collar crime. #RogerStone obviously helped the Russians attack our country. He's going to prison.

@RepJerryNadler I can't help but think how this reads like an organized crime syndicate from the 30s. The major factor in this story is that the @POTUS is the boss. Let that sink in.
