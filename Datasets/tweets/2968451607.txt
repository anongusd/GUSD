In the last Congress, Republicans passed a tax bill that did a lot for corporations, wealthy shareholders, and high-paid CEOs. Yet, as many people are going to discover on this year's returns, it did little for regular Americans. THIS Congress is going to change that.
Students often struggle with real-time costs and future debt for the education they need to pursue their dreams. The #EITC Modernization Act would allow roughly 3 million students who are eligible for Pell Grants (many of whom have dependents) to receive the EITC.
By 2020, an estimated 117 Million Americans will need caregiver assistance. Often this care is given by unpaid caregivers, primarily women, who provided billions of dollars in unpaid care in the United States in 2012 yet are 30% more likely to face financial instability.
When EITC has been expanded, poverty decreases and financial stability increases for working- and middle-class people. The #EITC Modernization Act increases allows caregivers and students to access EITC.
While Republicans propose more tax cuts for millionaires and billionaires on the false promise that the money will "trickle down" to everyone else (a promise that has failed to materialize over and over) the Earned Income Tax Credit has been proven to work.
Working families are no longer making ends meet. Wage growth for most workers has been stagnant while costs have gone up. The ability to save is non-existent, a medical emergency or a broken-down car can send people over the edge.
This Congress I'll be reintroducing the #EITC Modernization Act, a bill that would make a simple but important change to the tax code, allowing caregivers and full-time, emancipated higher-education students to receive the earned income tax credit. https://t.co/qibLbiafxo

It’s important to acknowledge the role workers played in bringing an end to this shutdown. Be it the countless phone calls to House &amp; Senate offices, the aid given to furloughed workers by their fellow union members or the actions of workers at our airports. They share this win.

Your shutdown has to end @realDonaldTrump. Is your stubbornness really worth all this? Regular Americans don't have their own planes. They rely on Air Traffic Controllers to make sure they get to their destination safely.
Due to staffing issues resulting from the #TrumpShutdown there is a ground stoppage at the major airports that service New Jersey: Newark Liberty, LaGuardia and Philadelphia Int’l. Air Traffic Controllers have had to dial back the number of incoming flights to ensure safety.

We may disagree on what foreign policy to enact, but there can be no argument that our decisions should be based on the guidance of our intelligence agencies, our interests, and our values — not a foreign leader. @RealDonaldTrump’s inability to lead will have dire consequences.
The American people don’t support this wall, or the tactics Trump’s using to get it. Republicans and Democrats in Congress already passed a compromise, and I hope Trump will consider putting on his big boy pants and joining us so that we can re-open the government.
All told, 420,000 people will work without pay, and another 380,000 will be furloughed because of Trump’s tantrum.
Border patrol agents — the people doing the real work of securing the border Trump has feigns concern for — will be forced to work without pay. The same thing goes for air traffic controllers and TSA agents, correctional officers, and firefighters with the U.S. Forest Service.
We’ve entered the #TrumpShutdown because of the President’s infantile demand for a wall that has been panned as an ineffective, wasteful, and unnecessary by nearly every border security expert you can find. Mexico was never going to pay for it, and taxpayers shouldn’t either.
I would be remiss not to call out how ludicrous this entire situation is. Republicans control both houses of Congress and the White House — Donald Trump, Mitch McConnell and Paul Ryan are in charge of the agenda and therefore responsible for the mess they’ve made.

So while corporate profits have soared, wages are barely keeping up with inflation. State legislatures and Voters themselves have approved minimum wage hikes in states from Florida to Alaska, Maine to California.
In fact, only 4.4% of US workers got a wage increase or bonus as a result of the bill. Meanwhile, US companies spent $1 TRILLION on stock buybacks to inflate their value and enrich big stockholders and executives.
It seems every week we learn more about how the GOP #taxscam was a lie. They promised the cuts would lead to big bonuses from employers. In fact, in the last year cash bonuses only gave workers 2 cents in avg. hourly compensation. https://t.co/2MF8YtlA4Z

Those numbers have likely expanded under the new zero-tolerance policies that have been put into place recently. THIS is why states like New Jersey and California have refused to participate in #ICE detainments. It threatens the rights of legal residents and citizens.
County Sheriffs kidnapped a native born citizen and almost deported him to a country he doesn't know. This is not an isolated case. Over a 4-year period over 800 US Citizens and 20k green card holders with NO criminal record were detained by ICE . https://t.co/YYg4UkcDvF https://t.co/FMadoyK0bY

It takes some nerve to tell veterans – men and women who have sacrificed for our country -- that it’s too much work to audit erroneous payments. The VA is telling vets it’s inconvenient to do their job, leaving vets to figure out a mess they didn’t create. I am appalled.
When the VA told us that computer errors had led to incorrect GI Bill payments, they promised veterans AND Congress that they would ensure full payments were received. Now they are saying, even AFTER the problem is fixed, they won’t make reimbursements... https://t.co/6cqjDKHEID

Examples of corporate greed like we’ve seen this week will continue to occur until we restore economic fairness -- including a tax system that emphasizes workers and real job creation over Wall Street excess.
Make no mistake, the President’s efforts to foment fear of immigrants is a classic tactic to deflect criticism for the failed economic policies of the Republican party.
These cuts will devastate the communities built around these plants. Many people in these communities voted for Trump, who lied to them about protecting their jobs. Trump’s response? Blame China, blame Obama, blame immigrants.
GM saved $500 million from the Trump tax scam. Instead of expanding, they used $100 million of that on stock buybacks to pad the pockets of wealthy shareholders. Monday they announced that they will close 5 plants and lay off 15,000 workers to further expand their profit margins.
Every day since that tax cut passed we have gotten more and more frustrating news about shareholders hoarding their windfall while corporate executives stick it to working people. Yesterday’s news from General Motors is just the latest example.
President Trump and the Republican-led Congress rammed through a  $1.5 trillion tax cut this year that they promised would bringing manufacturing jobs back to the United States. In fact, saving US manufacturing was a pillar of Trump’s 2016 campaign. https://t.co/hC3XN9f5W2

I can’t wait for Mikie Sherrill to join the 116th Congress.  A former Navy Pilot and federal prosecutor, Mikie is a no-nonsense voice for working people and veterans. She will bring enormous energy to the 11th District.

In a system in which only 6 in 1000 rape perpetrators see jail time, victims are put through the ringer; called “hysterical,” “liar,” “confused,” “mixed up,” and “slut.”

It’s simple really: Step 1, cut taxes for the wealthy and corporations to create a budget deficit in the TRILLIONS. Step 2, point to the deficit and say “look, we have to tighten our belts, we can’t afford these programs,”  despite what they do to help hardworking Americans.

Vladimir Putin has been described as a "very disciplined negotiator." I am actively exploring ways to prevent this President from being in a position to further capitulate to, be taken advantage of by, or even continue possible collusion with Mr. Putin.
We need someone negotiating on our behalf who fully grasps the threats on the world stage and is willing to make tough choices to protect the United States and its interests. Sadly, President Trump is woefully unqualified and uniquely unfit for this task.
This President is currently being investigated related to his, his campaign, and his senior aides' role in the very election meddling that he refuses to acknowledge.
Any president who continues to deny the role Russia played in the 2016 election and sides with Putin over our own agencies is in no position to objectively negotiate on behalf of the United States. International politics rest in a precarious balance.
Meanwhile, @realDonaldTrump has regularly deferred to statements from the Kremlin as opposed to our own intelligence agencies. https://t.co/Jw3QSfQaeY Donald Trump refuses to put our nation above his fragile ego and glaring self-interest.

We need to acknowledge that the War on Drugs didn’t just fail; it was a failure to stay true to the values of equality and fairness that we hold dear. All drug use, opioid, cocaine, and otherwise, should be treated as an addiction, not criminal behavior.
This week the House is debating bills that will ensure we handle the opioid epidemic as the health crisis it is. For years we treated addiction as a criminal activity. Rather than treatment and intervention, the War on Drugs doled out prison sentences that many are still serving

This budget is a peak into the same shortsighted, misguided, and reckless strategies that have run Trump’s businesses into the ground. I refuse to stand by idly while Trump and House Republicans roll back progress
Unsurprisingly, healthcare is STILL under assault. "The net result is a $675 billion federal spending cut by 2028. That includes a $1.4 trillion cut to Medicaid [..] after Trump promised during his presidential campaign not to cut the program."@dylanlscott https://t.co/ubjD2a7vY5
This budget makes it harder to get a college education. @AnnieReporter: "The budget would eliminate subsidized loans. Some 5.7 million students had subsidized loans in the 2016-2017 academic year, according to Mark Kantrowitz, a student loan expert."https://t.co/NaMlLildBz

First, it's a direct attack on the most vulnerable. As @HCheadle reminds us: "But as president, he is devoting a large amount of energy to making it harder to be poor in America. That may sound harsh, but it's all right there on the page." https://t.co/wZvgf844AT
Trump's budget proposal is a manifestation of empty rhetoric and broken promises &amp; exemplifies this Administration's lack of understanding for the needs of the American people. Just take a look at how this budget guts the foundation of the American dream.

I choose to protest by standing with women, wearing black, and uplifting the long history of marginalized women who were ignored. But also, ensuring this President sees the faces of the Americans he is hurting.
There’s always this ‘and us’ situation as it relates to black women, and that, when we focus on the issues of the day that involve discrimination or assault against women, we’re not immediately thought of in the context of that suffering.	https://t.co/xVPaa1JIqt

These are Christians who came to America because they were escaping religious persecution. They are no danger to our community. All of this is a betryal on the word of the President, the word of his Homeland Security Department, and most of all — our American values.

Congratulations, @SenDuckworth! I certainly miss seeing you around the House but am so inspired by the voice and passion you have brought to the Senate. Wishing you a happy and healthy pregnancy! https://t.co/20v1UYZNtD
On Maternal Health Awareness day and every day we must support increasing access to adequate and essential healthcare that mothers and children deserve. Allowing new mothers to gain healthcare is the first step and I will continue to fight for this necessary legislation.
That’s why I introduced the Healthy MOM Act - designates pregnancy as a Qualifying Life Event, creating a special enrollment period so that pregnant women can get the care they need to have healthy pregnancies and healthy infants.
Health insurance coverage during pregnancy can lead to healthier pregnancies and better birth outcomes but could also generate health care cost saving.
Did you know that if an uninsured woman discovers she is pregnant outside the open enrollment period, she will likely be unable to obtain affordable coverage with appropriate benefits for most or all of her pregnancy?
It is a tragedy that so many preventable deaths still occur, especially given that many life-saving maternal and child health solutions are well-known and cost-effective. Yet these simple solutions remain elusive for far too many women and children.
It's Maternal Health Awareness Day in New Jersey and I'm so proud to see so many people devoted to raising awareness and redoubling our efforts to meet the urgent need for better maternal health care around the world. https://t.co/gNO3ozicVa

Talking taxes with @jiveDurkey on @cheddar. The #GOPTaxScam is a brazen attack on New Jersey and especially on the communities that I represent. No wonder all but one member from NJ voted no: double taxation, devastates property values, jeopardizes local budgets. https://t.co/2P45OP2Wlk
They already pay enough in taxes as it is — whether it’s Princeton,  Franklin, &amp; Scotch Plains or Willingboro, Moorestown and Brick. Clearly you made up your mind a long time ago, &amp; that’s unfortunate. But until this thing is signed, you still have a chance to do the right thing.
The harm this bill will have on NJ is beyond dispute. Our entire delegation voted against this bill except you.

This bill is a brazen attack on NJ. By limiting the state &amp; local tax deduction, it subjects New Jerseyans to double taxation, devastates property values, &amp; puts state &amp; local budgets at risk, &amp; the communities I represent would be some of the hardest hit in the entire nation.
Instead of working with Democrats to reform our tax code, Republicans chose to rush through a partisan giveaway to the rich and powerful that adds $1.5 trillion to the deficit, triggers $25 billion in cuts to Medicare, and increases the number of uninsured by 13 million.
The American people have made clear they see this #GOPTaxScam for what it is: a massive tax cut for the President and his rich friends and donors. Americans must remember who stood with them to oppose this legislation and those who voted for the 1%.	https://t.co/4qgotx743H

@CFPB As Mr. Cordray steps down, I urge the President to immediately appoint a new director of the CFPB that will be just as dedicated to the agency’s mission.
@CFPB Since January, the CFPB has been under attack by my Republican colleagues and this Administration - to weaken the bureau will open the door for bad actors in the banking and financial sectors to repeat practices that lead to the worst recession since the Great Depression.
@CFPB Under Mr. Cordray’s leadership, the CFPB held banks and financial institutions accountable as they interact with consumers – ensuring clear &amp; streamlined processes, penalties for bad practices &amp; the creation of tools to allow the American public to make smart financial decisions.
In the wake of the Great Recession, the @CFPB was established with the sole mission of protecting the American consumer - Mr. Cordray made that mission a personal standard.	https://t.co/iL6BeE78Vv

I am supporting the #VRA because there is nothing more sacred in our democracy than the right to vote. #RestoreTheVote https://t.co/Img2exOmyn
Members of Congress opposing efforts to #RestoreTheVRA want us to believe racial discrimination only exists in history books. They're wrong.
The Shelby County #SCOTUS decision gutted the VRA four years ago. Congress must come together and work to #RestoreTheVRA this year.
More than 50 years after passage of the VRA, racial discrimination in voting persists. We must come together and finally #RestoreTheVRA.
It prohibited any denial of vote based on race, color, or minority status #VRA1982
It required voters to receive assistance due to blindness, disability, or inability to read or write #VRA1982
The 1982 VRA amendments fundamentally influenced voting rights legislation by making it easier to prove a violation
It’s important to remember not only how far we have come, but how far we still need to go to protect the fundamental right to vote
35 years ago today, Congress enacted the 1982 amendments to the VRA, which made Section 2 of the VRA permanent #VRA1982

The goal of the US court system at its purest is to provide equal consideration in the eyes of the law. #HR1215 is a direct affront to this.
Legal remedies often stand as the last refuge of justice for the injured and aggrieved, regardless of wealth or influence
This bill further erodes the right to trial by jury by imposing a 3- year statute of limitations - shorter than most state laws #HR1215
This bill would devastate the injured by capping non-economic damages to $250k - even for loss of limb, permanent disability, or death!
Disguised as a step toward health care affordability - this legislation tramples on the rights of Americans harmed in health care settings.
Today, my colleagues will vote on #HR1215 – the so-called "Protecting Access to Care Act"
