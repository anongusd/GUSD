At that point he can pass whatever bill Congress can agree on, override Trump's inevitable veto, and effectively cut Trump off at the knees. Then Pence can move forward with 25'ing Trump, and McConnell and Pence will be hailed as saviors by right wing media. Simple. 4/4
In McConnell's case, he's capitalizing on the fact that Trump claimed responsibility for the shutdown (on camera!) like the fucking moron he is. All McConnell has to do is wait for things to get super bad, to the point where Trump's approval starts to tank even among R‚Äôs 3/4
His plan is to let things get so bad that the people of Arrakis rise up, @ which point the baron sacrifices Rabban &amp; replace him w/ his favorite nephew, Feyd, positioning the new ruler as the one who saved Arrakis from tyrrany, ensuring that Arrakis will love its new despot. 2/4

@franchisechild You can, but is that the best way to be? Could there not a more effective way that just hasn‚Äôt been learned yet?
@franchisechild ‚ÄúThe punishment fits the behavior‚Äù and how are your parents the authority on that exactly? Who taught them that and why? Was it effective or did it just continue a cycle of abuse that you may now carry on to your own children? Would you beat your children?
@boothstreetBG @jemelehill It‚Äôs interesting how you equivocate the act of sex and a negative image such as ‚Äúbump uglies‚Äù. Are all sexual encounters you have had referred to in the same way? If someone is performing an oral act on you do you paint her/him or the act itself as negatively or demeaning?

@csharp7 Good list, a few of these are already in my audible que. Thank you!
@csharp7 No worries, but if you have a valid reason that a group of people shouldn‚Äôt discuss racial issues that are within another community that are not it‚Äôs own that doesn‚Äôt consist of ‚Äúyou‚Äôre white, so you shouldn‚Äôt talk about this.‚Äù I‚Äôm absolutely willing to listen to it.
@csharp7 You keep linking to tweets that are unavailable.
@csharp7 How so?
@csharp7 Ad Hominem again.
@csharp7 You being uncomfortable doesn‚Äôt bother me, it‚Äôs that your taking it personally. Discussing Race at this moment is uncomfortable, but that doesn‚Äôt mean it should be avoided by any specific group, that‚Äôs why your argument is fallacious.
@csharp7 But that‚Äôs just it, I don‚Äôt. I disagree with your original argument that white people should sit this one out based on the fact we are ignorant. That is fallacious reasoning. It may be culturally true that it would be better to not comment, but not based off of your argument.
@csharp7 You seem to be very sensitive to this and are taking it personally, I am not. Your argument has flaws in it that I am not fully convinced make it valid. I‚Äôm glad Nih asking direct questions to help you make your argument better. You don‚Äôt seem to like that.
@csharp7 I‚Äôm asking questions from a skeptical standpoint to see if your argument has good logic. Thats what a debate should consist of.
@csharp7 That‚Äôs an ad Hominem attack. You don‚Äôt know me well enough to make the case that I‚Äôm ignorant about race. You‚Äôre also now using a hasty generalization fallacy in assuming that 99.9% of white people are as well. You‚Äôre right, I don‚Äôt know what I don‚Äôt know, but neither do you.
@csharp7 That being said, there is a time for sensitivity towards a race or culture that should be observed to allow for that community to have its own private discussions. However, that‚Äôs hard to make happen on an radically inclusive platform sigh as social media.
@csharp7 You‚Äôre creating a strawman argument here by misconstruing the topics. One is not like the other, one is a formal education the other one is not.
@csharp7 That feels like gatekeeping and it‚Äôs also fallacious argument since formal education isn‚Äôt always a sign of understanding. An argument should be held on its own merits not from a place of race.
@csharp7 That‚Äôs a false equivalency fallacy. They are not the same thing.

@deray I‚Äôd like to honestly know, if myself, a white person, making a comment or sharing an insight of my own regarding Kanye or ‚ÄúSlavery is a choice‚Äù is improper or uncomfortable to others? It‚Äôs a debate that‚Äôs happening internally within my circle.
Philosophical question: as a white person, is it uncomfortable to minorities for me to comment on Kanye West or the idea that ‚ÄúSlavery was a choice‚Äù?
@csharp7 Lemme rephrase, not ‚Äúrace‚Äù but on the problems that a different culture other than your own has?
@csharp7 So you‚Äôre saying that as a white person, no matter your reasoning skills or education be it formal or informal, you are not qualified to comment on race. Is that correct?

‚ÄúCoalitions that could pass a bill (but that don‚Äôt include the majority leader) don‚Äôt get the chance to form. Wallner says, the practice makes our political system less freewheeling and open. ‚ÄúBy stopping the legislative process before it starts, it makes compromise harder.‚Äù 7/7
‚ÄúSenators have kept up the practice because it helps keep their party unified, rather than enduring votes that divide it. But this centralization of Senate power has an enormous downside. It makes bipartisan compromise harder to achieve.‚Äù 6/7
‚ÄúWallner explains. Lyndon Johnson took it to a new level as the Senate majority leader in the 1950s, persuading even committee chairmen from not putting bills forward for a vote.‚Äù 5/7
‚ÄúJames Wallner, a senior fellow at the R Street Institute in Washington and a former Republican Senate staffer, gave me a history lesson yesterday about Senate procedure, &amp; I think it‚Äôs an important one. The practice of yielding to the majority leader began in the late 1940s‚Äù 4/7
‚ÄúSenate custom, however, has become that senators from both parties forfeit that power to the majority leader: The majority leader now decides what does and doesn‚Äôt get a vote.‚Äù 3/7
‚ÄùMcConnell¬†does not have the power¬†to block a bill from being voted on. No senator does, not even the majority leader. Any senator can propose that a bill receive a vote. And if 51 senators want it to receive a vote, they can ensure that it does.‚Äù 2/7
