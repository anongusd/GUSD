@slsprojectz @itsmikebivins I'm not their apologists but I'd love to see proof of that. I'd investigate and write about that.
@slsprojectz @itsmikebivins I realize shutting down speech is a hallmark of antifa. I see you support that. My point stands.
@_Orwell @shaggysnod @itsmikebivins Let 'em march. It's a freedom thing. Antifa is anti-freedom and is fascist. I look at what they do, not what they say they do. Pretty basic.
@robaweselot @itsmikebivins They got a permit. Marching with a flag for law and order is offensive?  How? So they're douchebags. Efforts to stop them by #antifa is a fascist brown shirt tactic. But, hey, if it weren't for double standards Leftists would have no standards at all.
@robaweselot @itsmikebivins "Supremacist adjacent"? Now we're dealing in human derivatives? The pretzel logic employed by the Left never ceases to astonish.

Based on the video I've seen from tonight's #PDX march the "racists" have Patriot Prayer have more diversity than #Antifa. 	@itsmikebivins
@itsmikebivins Dude's wearing a dress?
@itsmikebivins If antifa stays home it doesn't happen.	If police do their jobs and 'protect' those patriot dudes it doesn't happen. 	It's stupid and ridiculous. 	But it doesn't happen without the Leftist antifa. 	If patriot guys don't show antifa still commits violence. 	Anyone see a pattern?
@itsmikebivins Moot point I suppose, but if antifa doesn't show up to stop the march for 'law and order' does any violence happen? no. pretty easy to connect those dots.
@itsmikebivins Interesting. I'd like to the see the video that predated this one. I'll wait. If they were unprovoked and trashed antifa, I can understand their anger, but it's not justifiable. I'll look forward to seeing the video before this or do I have to look elsewhere?

Didn't you hear? She just blamed the "victim" for leaking it. https://t.co/oapUxJgdJf
#Twitter @Jack just temporarily locked me down because I'd been tweeting too many #Kavanaugh updates.
Sounds like #Feinstein is victim shaming by blaming #DrFord for leaking her own letter to the media.	#Kavanaugh 	#Circus	#ClownCar https://t.co/QL0Kt5b9tz
Stop with the "tell *her* truth." That confers honesty on a personal feeling that may not be true. 	#Spartacus 	#Circus	#ClownCar 	#Kavanaugh https://t.co/q9iyqLzOw1
Sure, she sounds like she knows what she's talking about. #Kavanaugh #Circus #ClownCar https://t.co/Dmvklp0Aig
@JessieJaneDuff @WorkPlaceRpt Well she sounds as smart as #AlyssaMilano so nobody believes her anyway.

Look at how he defers to the redacted portion of his testimony so he doesn't throw the former roommate under the bus in public. She's horrible. https://t.co/pVi9lqgRdW

@rasmansa @NevilleD35 sigh...
The second mic drop moment of the #Kavanaugh hearing is when #DrFord said that #EdWhelan's mystery man who looks like #Kavanaugh was GOING OUT WITH HER at the time of the alleged attack. 	What the hell is going on here?
