@richardbranson It's time to do something bigger, more fulfilling, that changes the direction of humanity for the better - just in time so you can live to see it. It's time for something new.
All definitions need to be restated and agreed to before dialogue can be successful since reality is under assault in our country. We are at war with forces that divide and weaken us. Neutrality as a journalistic solution is like Valium for our soldiers as a military solution. https://t.co/NfWFnzYbMz
@Robert_in_Cali @KayluvsPrada @NagyWrites @KernUnited @cenkuygur You lose an academic audience with quotes around all journalists and equating all journalism as equally biased without even the option of professional integrity in reporting.
@KayluvsPrada @Robert_in_Cali @NagyWrites @KernUnited @cenkuygur ‚ÄúGood‚Äù without bias. ;-)
@KayluvsPrada @NagyWrites @KernUnited @cenkuygur For clarification: If my story includes, ‚ÄúNeutral reporting is....‚Äù then my story can not be neutral?
@NagyWrites @KernUnited @cenkuygur Someone just said a neutral story can not use any descriptive or expository sentences. Really? No facts - only opinions as we claim a fact about the definition of neutral? Looking for clarification more than the usual social media selfrighteousness.
@KernUnited @NagyWrites @cenkuygur The certainty of these definitions with the flavor of arrogance in this social climate is becoming a bit of a farce.		The people in power would not teach the same journalism 101 curriculum. The floor of definition you flippantly stand on is not a floor as you fall through it.
@xychelsea This needs an alternative to support, yet you run for office? Message needs a second phrase.
@johnrenison @RepJuanVargas My introduction to you was your patently false and unfair statement, suggesting all Rep Vargas does is try to scare people.  So, no "believe me" does not fix your challenges here. Next, I suggested a more positive campaign and this is your reply. Done.
@johnrenison @RepJuanVargas One more thing about ‚Äúall you do is scare...‚Äù I just saw Rep Vargas testifying on behalf of veterans who need care. Do you Mr. Renison stand by that being a scare tactic?
@SenFeinstein WMD? Are you SURE? Really?
@johnrenison @RepJuanVargas First impression: Negative.	‚ÄúAll you do is scare...‚Äù 	We are about to see a public demand for positive authenticity. Try again next election.
@RepJuanVargas If they all Tweeted racist slurs about President Obama, Trump would pardon them, defend them and reunite their families.
@RepJimmyPanetta Jimmy Panetta spoke brilliantly to the Monterey Rotary today, covering a wide range of pertinent issues, and after looking forward to meeting him for quite some time, I decided to post an open letter to him.	https://t.co/aTFIvSB6Np
@FridaGhitis @realDonaldTrump We can give Trump and the GOP credit for everything in year 7 of his Presidency; that's the year Cookie Monster gains prominence.
@FridaGhitis Thank you for not forgetting the suffering.
@FridaGhitis America is caving contains the most important words spoken this year. Thank you for your career and your insight. Please see about yelling louder to be heard above the serialized release of mind numbing info. We need a rational movement.
@PaulCallan Have you ever gone over the speed limit risking the lives of those around you? Should that be my CNN piece?
@toddstarnes Industry propaganda propped up by the body of a brain dead boy. When your listeners figure out what's going on, you'll be done.
@cnnbrk I'm done CNN. We know "fake news" is to make CNN soft. You REplay Trump's justification for murder. Our murders. NO video of that!üò°
