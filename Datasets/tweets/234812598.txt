House Democrats have taken a massive step towards turning America into a socialist nation by introducing their government-run, one-size-fits-all, single-payer health care bill.	https://t.co/8XLHPmyf82 https://t.co/aU0NQ0kMud
These bills are nothing but a ploy to make it more difficult for law-abiding citizens to purchase firearms and protect themselves and their families.
While well-intended, neither of these bills would solve the problem Washington Democrats are claiming – an end to gun violence.	https://t.co/ANNIAF0KwO https://t.co/pzzhcMf9qC

They should be held accountable by the American people for this politically motivated side show.
Democrats have reached a new low in their effort to attack President Trump. Bringing a convicted liar to Capitol Hill in an attempt to embarrass the President as he is overseas participating in a critical summit with real international implications is appalling.
This is more political theater showing that Washington Democrats are seemingly more concerned about opposing President Trump than supporting policies that put the safety &amp; security of our communities first and address the humanitarian crisis taking place along our southern border
Today, Democrats held a show vote to cancel President Trump’s recently issued emergency declaration, which he declared only after Washington Democrats blocked Republican efforts in Congress to provide much-needed funding to secure our southern border.	https://t.co/kuWmcqYdz5 https://t.co/j86SMx1S6t

I am deeply troubled by recent efforts in New York and Virginia to legalize abortion up until the moment of delivery and beyond. I support President Trump’s call to “reaffirm a fundamental truth: all children – born and unborn – are made in the holy image of God.”

Virginia Governor Northam should resign. There is no place in our society for racism in any form. The picture from his Medical School yearbook is indefensible.
The US economy added 304,000 jobs in January, and throughout 2018, the average monthly gain was 223,000 jobs. This economic boom is no coincidence, it is the direct product of the pro-growth policies put in place by President Trump and the Republicans in Congress
Thanks to a conservative agenda of cutting taxes and rolling back unnecessary regulations to empower Main Street job creators, January marks a record-breaking 100th straight month of job gains. https://t.co/aaATlwjeU3

If Senator Harris and Washington Democrats get their way and complete this total government takeover of health care, your access to treatment will be solely at the mercy of Washington bureaucrats.

If Speaker Pelosi really believes what she told Congress and the American people last year when she said, ‘As Members of Congress, we have a moral responsibility to act now to protect DREAMers,’ then she would put forth the President’s proposal for a vote in the House tomorrow.
and it also contained a legislative solution to provide legal protection for 700,00 DACA recipients and 300,000 Temporary Protected Status recipients sought by Democrats in Congress.
It contains $5.7 billion for additional personnel and a physical barrier to secure our southern border sought by President Trump and Republicans in Congress,
This week, President Trump proposed a commonsense proposal to secure our border and end this needless government shutdown.
During this speech, she said ‘there is nothing partisan or political about protecting DREAMers.’ However, with the Speaker’s gavel back in hand, she has seemingly changed her mind, putting her political agenda before the DREAMers she so passionately urged the Congress to protect.
Almost a year ago, Speaker Pelosi spoke on the House floor for more than eight hours about the importance of bringing a legislative solution for recipients of the  Deferred Action for Child Arrivals (DACA) program. 	https://t.co/SihtgS4L2Y https://t.co/lxvdbuJ4cR

Enough is enough. Democrats must come to the table, put forth legislation that the President will sign and end this politically charged shutdown.
Democrats are once again standing between federal employees on furlough as well as those that continue to show up for work each day and their paychecks.
I just voted to pay all federal employees that have been furloughed and those that have continued to work without pay throughout the duration of this partial government shutdown that started on December 22. Democrats in the House blocked it.

This bill will help create more clean, American-made energy and jobs while also preserving environmental standards.
Prior to my bill becoming law, many projects never even got off the drawing board because it could take over a decade of navigating the federal permitting process before a project could even begin.
Last Congress I authored a bill that was signed into law by President Trump expediting the process to turn existing dams into hydro-powered dams.
#ICYMI: https://t.co/jGhId9Uyuc
President Trump outlined today a common sense, reasonable offer to end the shutdown. This includes investment in border security to end the border crisis and addresses DACA and TPS. These are programs which Dems have said are priorities to them. Dems stop playing 2020 politics.
I urge the Democrats to end the political gamesmanship and to stop holding the government hostage, come to the table to secure our nation, and pass a bill that the Senate and President Trump will sign.
Instead of helping thousands of federal employees – many of whom are working without pay – to get their paychecks, House Democrats voted against this proposal and to deny federal employees their paychecks.
This limited proposal would not reopen the government without addressing the crisis at our Southwest border, but it would bring relief to federal employees who have missed their first paycheck of the year.
Today, House Republicans brought a proposal to the floor to allow federal employees affected by the government shutdown to receive their first paycheck of the year.
I support @GOPLeader McCarthy’s decision not to seat Rep. Steve King on any committees for the 116th Congress. There is absolutely no place in America for racism, and his views do not reflect those of the Republican party.
