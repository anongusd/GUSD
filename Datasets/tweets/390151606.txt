@raiyn @wdet Following what we saw in Florida, if we adopted an A-F system today, in three years, our schools would be just starting to hit their stride, and in 10 years, we'd see substantial improvement. #Mied #policymeetsthepeople
@DPGilmartin @MishaStallworth @wdet @MMLeague @raiyn @mattbach Yes. And we need to expand great educational offerings around the state so that students and families have access to the schools they want. #MIed #policymeetsthepeople
@blocht574 Thanks, Todd! Great insights from someone on the front lines. Thanks for all you do.
@SHDetroit Sure, plenty of examples. Look at the Charlton Heston Academy in St. Helen. Started by the community when their local traditional public school was closing down. 100% driven by the community. #MIed #policymeetsthepeople
@blocht574 @SHDetroit @GJNeher @John_C_Austin @MiED We agree - and there are plenty of great charter schools that aren't in shiny new buildings! We need innovative, quality schools. #MIed #policymeetsthepeople
@SHDetroit @GJNeher @John_C_Austin @MiED And we totally agree that no community needs "unnecessary schools," whatever kind of school they are. #MIed #policymeetsthepeople
@SHDetroit @GJNeher @John_C_Austin @MiED We're not talking about the "market." We're talking about the educational needs and desires of the community. #MIed
We also need to highlight the excellent teachers out there! We invite you to check out our FB and Twitter pages this week - we're highlighting the 5 finalists for the Mich Charter School Teacher of the Year award with videos. Creative, talented, innovative people! #MIed
@raiyn @blocht574 @wdet We would agree with that! The only driving force should be doing what's best for kids. Period. #MIEd #policymeetsthepeople
@MASB @aftmichigan @raiyn @wdet Quite true. We need a fair, consistent system that's easy for everyone to understand. @MIed #policymeetsthepeople
@GJNeher @John_C_Austin Interesting. Michigan's charter school community also responds to need. A new school won't open unless there's a clear community need for it. @MIed #policymeetsthepeople
@raiyn @wdet It's frustrating for everyone - especially teachers - when the measures keep changing every year. They deserve consistency. #MiEd #policymeetsthepeople
@GJNeher @John_C_Austin Did @John_C_Austin give any examples of No. 3?
@blocht574 We agree! There needs to be consistency in how we measure quality teachers and schools. #MIed #policymeetsthepeople #Miched
@raiyn @wdet It's not just theory. Evidence shows that when schools have clear and fair expectations, their performance improves. It's exactly what happened when Florida instituted an A-F system. https://t.co/H8YpP4oq7T
Two priorities that will improve education in Michigan: Fund every student equitably, and improve accountability across the board with an A-F letter-grading system for schools. Kids and parents win in the states where that's happened. #MIED #PolicyMeetsThePeople
Happy to be here for the discussion! Every child in Michigan deserves a quality education in a quality school #MIed #PolicyMeetsThePeople

@jdouglaslittle @charteralliance @dquisenberrymi Always nice to hear someone with no skin in the game telling Michigan parents they don't deserve a choice in their child's education.
@jdouglaslittle @charteralliance @dquisenberrymi You've obviously never been in a charter school. If charters are supposedly "pushing out" the children that are hard to educate, then they're doing a really bad job of it. Charters take some of the hardest-to-educate children and give them the support they need to succeed.
Facts are facts. Let's continue to work on making sure that every child receives a quality education in a quality school. #mileg #celebratecharters https://t.co/mAsLhzB6Br

@ChrisGreigMI37 It's not only sloppy math - it's simply a lie to say that 252 charter schools in Michigan are "run by for-profit companies."
@ChrisGreigMI37 Rep. Greig, your math is sloppy and you need a primer on how charter schools operate. First off, that 252 number includes both for-profit companies and non-profit organizations. Second, many of those schools only contract for certain services, usually human resources.
@ChrisGreigMI37 They are "run" by for-profit companies, or they contract for certain services, like human resources or food services? More than half of traditional public schools contract for some service. By your reckoning, those districts are "run" by for-profit companies?

@ChrisGreigMI37 Parents don't care about academic outcomes? Not one word about that in your pandering legislation.
@ChrisGreigMI37 You're discriminating against charter school parents and students because of the type of school they've chosen. You want them to get less money (regional enhancement millages, etc.). You want to punish their schools. That's discrimination.
@ChrisGreigMI37 Um, where are you getting your "more than 80 percent" number? Because that's not close to the correct number. And yes, every dime a charter school spends is publicly reported and accounted for. #ReadTheBills was just an attempt to appease political donors.
@ChrisGreigMI37 Your cherry-picking argument is absolutely ridiculous and has no basis in fact. Where's your evidence on this? It's highly irresponsible of you to throw a comment out there like that with nothing to back it up.
@childs @ChrisGreigMI37 @PamFaris1 That's the beautiful thing about school choice. You can send your child to any school you want. Just don't deny other parents the choices that they've made.
@childs @ChrisGreigMI37 @PamFaris1 Then you need to get out more! Where do you live? We'd be happy to arrange a tour.
@ChrisGreigMI37 EXACTLY - we need to put parents first. So why are you so determined to discriminate against charter public school students, @ChrisGreigMI37?
@childs @ChrisGreigMI37 @PamFaris1 Actually no, they don't. https://t.co/s0SADbzw5a
@ChrisGreigMI37 PLEASE - study the facts before you tweet. This might help shed some light on how well Michigan's charters perform. https://t.co/s0SADbzw5a
@ChrisGreigMI37 Totally false, and she knows it. Michigan's charter schools are totally transparent, and they have more oversight and accountability than traditional public schools. That's why Michigan is considered a model state when it comes to charter laws.
@ChrisGreigMI37 Charter schools are public schools, too. Why are you bent on discriminating against parents who have chosen this type of public school for their child?
@ChrisGreigMI37 You are not speaking the truth, Rep. Greig. Charter schools must take EVERY student that applies, and they do. And in Michigan, they do perform better. You're obviously interested in the subject, so we'd be happy to sit down with you.
Wow. This is the difference that a talented, passionate charter school teacher can make in a child's life. #chartersrock #celebratecharters https://t.co/y5bKE0HkC9

@blocht574 @bendegrow @MackinacCenter @MISchoolChoice @miedchoice @PSOMichigan @ChoiceMediatv If you're advocating taking choice away from parents and giving it to the government, we would have to respectfully disagree.

@SenBennetCO Thanks for asking - here are the facts about Mich charter schools. https://t.co/RdM9pOzFV6
@SHendersonFreep @JasonBedrick @freep You don't like the findings, so it's "overplayed."
@LoriAHiggins Only about a dozen closed for academic failure? Better check that again.
@SHendersonFreep @bendegrow Laugh at Michigan charters? Um, no. Re-read what CREDO director had to say about us.
@SHendersonFreep @bendegrow So you criticized something that you didn't read.
@SHendersonFreep @bendegrow You still haven't pointed out 1 fact in our press release that was wrong. Did u read it? https://t.co/RdM9pOzFV6
@SHendersonFreep You mean the report that was only 15% accurate? No thanks. https://t.co/hKgfHYA05T
@SHendersonFreep So, what in that press release is incorrect?
@jeffmossberg @Ingrid_Jacques @SenBennetCO @BetsyDeVos Most state university boards are appointed, and yet are still accountable, right?
@jeffmossberg @Ingrid_Jacques @SenBennetCO @BetsyDeVos Every charter school has statewide boundaries. You'd need 300 statewide elections
@SHendersonFreep Here are the facts. https://t.co/RdM9pOzFV6
