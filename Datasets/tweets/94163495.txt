@mcain1992 @chenelsfm @nyc311 And thank you for reading our social media posts, @chenelsfm.
@talk_nyc @NYTWA @866lawmike @nyctaxinews The PSA is correct because it explains the reasons why drivers cannot refuse, such as race, ethnicity, and gender.  Commissioner Joshi is our current Commissioner.
@chenelsfm @nyc311 @mcain1992 That being said, drivers have the right of due process and can make their case in an independent, administrative court that the refusal was justified, such as if the passenger was disorderly or intoxicated.
@chenelsfm @nyc311 @mcain1992 We try to promote the option to report it to the TLC so they know this is illegal and something our prosecutors take very seriously.
@chenelsfm @nyc311 @mcain1992 No problem.  We find it challenging to have passengers who do experience race-based and other refusals report it to us.  Often, passengers feel very frustrated or disappointed,, but then let it go.
@chenelsfm @nyc311 @mcain1992 A driver cannot refuse based on a passenger's race, ethnicity, cultural background, gender, or sexual orientation.  Passengers also have the right to go to any destination in NYC, Westchester, Nassau, or Newark Airport.
@chenelsfm @nyc311 @mcain1992 That is a common question.  A refusal is justified if the passenger is intoxicated or disorderly, has refused to stop smoking, or if they are carrying an article that a driver reasonably believes will damage the vehicle.
@NYCDisabilities @NYCMayor @NYCCalise @nyc311 @nycgov @NYCMayorsOffice @MayorsPEU @mayorsCAU @NYCHRA @NYCCHR Fantastic!
Thanks for the retweet, Ms. Lamah!
@ToneSS_D @nyc311 It is an important balance.  The vast majority of drivers pick up everyone, but unfortunately, some drivers still engage in race and destination-based refusals in the taxi and FHV sectors.
@ToneSS_D @nyc311 Protecting our licensees and the public is at the core of what we do.  Last year, for instance, our Driver Protection Unit prosecuted more than 360 cases, largely against garages, FHV owners, and FHV bases.
@talk_nyc @NYTWA @866lawmike @nyctaxinews Commissioner Meera Joshi is the current TLC Commissioner.  An on-duty driver can never refuse someone because of their race, ethnicity, cultural background, destination (if NYC/Westchester/Nassau/Newark Airport), disability, gender, or sexual orientation.

@nayeem87784696 HI Nayeem, thank you for asking.  The FHV sector has a very different business model than the yellow and green taxi sectors.  Our research has found that a minimum trip pay standard is the best way ensure to drivers FHV drivers receive livable income for their work.
@moe145 I'll message you when the calculator is available online.  That should be the easiest tool.  : )
@iamdogluke Hi Luke, there is no minimum wage requirement, we set a pay standard for trips dispatched by large for-hire vehicle companies.  You can learn more here: https://t.co/v0t5dSttbr.
@moe145 We should have an online calculator to share shortly with you.  It is a per-trip payment formula based on miles and minutes that ensures a minimum take-home pay after expenses, and accounts for drivers' total working time.
Just a friendly reminder that the newly passed TLC rules are not a minimum hourly wage for drivers ‚Äì this would not make sense for the FHV business model.  It is a minimum pay standard per trip, a floor.  Check out the rules here: https://t.co/bp1lTApsBz.  DM us any questions. https://t.co/ISCAWHy7Cg
@Lariolson1 Have you signed up for payments yet through the Taxi Improvement Fund? https://t.co/Vt69kXMPk5
@Lariolson1 Do you mean an Accessible Dispatch trip?
@Lariolson1 We also recently doubled payments to wheelchair accessible drivers per trip.  Accessible taxi drivers now earn an additional $1,700 per year.
@Lariolson1 Under the rules, more wheelchair accessible taxi owners will be able to receive payments of $14,000 a year when a car is put on the road, and then $4,000 a year while in service.
@Lariolson1 I will add that the rules passed on Tuesday will lower credit card fees for fleet taxi drivers, saving an average of $1000 a year.
@Lariolson1 The pay regulation we are adding to the for-hire vehicle sector has been in the taxi sector since 1997.  This move brings greater regulation to the for-hire vehicle sector.
The TLC passed transparency rules yesterday that will ensure for-hire vehicle drivers receive detailed pay and deduction info, as well as leases written in plain language that specify all costs.  Learn more here: https://t.co/jAXtaxR4V2. https://t.co/RdX6j3uDeF
More than $600 million a year will be invested in NYC‚Äôs local economy from the newly approved Driver Income and Lease Transparency Rules approved by the TLC yesterday (https://t.co/jAXtaxR4V2).  More than 75,000 professional drivers will receive an average raise of 44.7%. https://t.co/nWtngAi1pT

@ReggieVaitz @JParrott10007 @qz @alisongriswold @CenterNYC @IRLEUCB @NYTWA @DrivingGuild Hi Reggie, the Driver Income and Transparency Rules provides greater regulation of the for-hire vehicle sector, similar to regulations that have existed in the taxi sector since 1997.

@2AvSagas Sorry to hear that, I'll check on them.
Currently, 96% of NYC ride app drivers earn less than $17.22 hourly (the independent contractor equivalent of the minimum wage).  Drivers deserve to earn a livable wage.  After the passage of our rules yesterday, more than 75,000 drivers will see a raise of almost $10,000 yearly. https://t.co/dJnOAWRR12
Ride app drivers who provide service in wheelchair accessible vehicles will receive higher minimum pay as part of the new rules the TLC passed. New pay rates will also be set for out-of-town trips: https://t.co/jAXtaxR4V2. https://t.co/YAqS3QLwk1
@TLCEddie Okay, take care.
@uberlyftdrivers Hi, it is a trip pay standard, not a minimum hourly wage.
96 percent of 80,000 ride app drivers in NYC will see a raise of almost $10,000 a year -- following the landmark passage of the TLC's Driver Income and Transparency rules today.  This is an average raise of 44.7%. https://t.co/7H3mMXCqtl

@Sifill_LDF @JNelsonLDF Yes, absolutely. I also want to thank LDF for their frequent testimony in City Council, most recently to prevent service refusal fines from being lowered by legislation. Kristen Johnson‚Äôs testimony was so important.
@nyc311 @Sifill_LDF Service refusals are a persistent, deeply rooted problem and we are grateful to LDF for continuing to work on this with us, as well as everyone who reports refusals to us so we can investigate and prosecute.
@nyc311 @Sifill_LDF Ms. Ifill, Ms. Nelson and their colleagues at LDF have been a close partner in supporting the city‚Äôs work to end race-based service refusals. Our prosecutors are working on this, and we are very grateful to them for reporting these illegal acts.
@jooltman The drivers we honored today also met a high trip threshold, not for everyone but we greatly appreciate their hard work, service, and vigilance.
Ms. Nelson, thank you so much for reporting this illegal act, this is terrible to hear. Our prosecutors will be in touch soon. The TLC appreciates everything LDF does to support the city‚Äôs work to end refusals. This should never happen. https://t.co/w1XuJKxZK5

The Upper West Side is the most popular location to request a taxi digitally, followed by the East Village and Lincoln Square area.  Learn more in the 2018 TLC Factbook: https://t.co/DTXev6AkuN. https://t.co/PxFG96Vknd
@PapaPiccione @DrivingGuild The City Council passed legislation in August pausing new for-hire vehicles (that are not wheelchair accessible) for one year while the City studies the impact of the industry's growth on congestion and driver well-being.
@JagaJatt This information is on page 13.
@JagaJatt Hi @jagajatt, the money was given to wheelchair accessible vehicle owners and drivers to defray the cost of operating the vehicle.  It was paid for by passengers through a 30-cent surcharge on yellow and green taxi trips.
Check out the TLC's 2018 Factbook here: https://t.co/DTXev6AkuN.  You can learn when and where shared rides are the most popular, what neighborhoods have the highest number of electronic taxi requests, and which day had the fewest number of trips since Jan. 2016. https://t.co/IzQ2he254N

@gracerauh We take investigation and prosecution of service refusal complaints extremely seriously, and drivers face steep fines and ultimately revocation if they refuse.
@gracerauh Cases that are not able to substantiated are often unfortunately because the passenger withdraws the complaint and decides not to go forward, or the rider is not reachable after multiple attempts by the TLC's prosecutors to speak to them.

@ursusmaije @nyc311 It is important that there is due process for the driver during the consumer complaint process, particularly since the driver can lose their license or face a significant penalty.
@ursusmaije @nyc311 Hi sir, sorry you are disappointed.  The way our consumer complaint process works is that the driver has the opportunity to plead guilty and accept a settlement offer.  If this does not happen, a hearing is scheduled at an administrative court and an OATH judge makes a decision.

@Reported_NYC @jpluvs1176 If you could resubmit, that would be terrific.  Or let our prosecutor know when they make contact.  Thank you.
@BeatingUpwind @Reported_NYC Forgive me, but I am going to humble-brag that we have the best prosecution team.
@MPFlowersNYC I see, the TLC has data for yellow and green taxi lost property inquiries.  For for-hire vehicles, passengers typically contact the company that provided the service.
@MPFlowersNYC In regards to lost property or in general? Thanks.

@JoannaG @chrisdoyle Thank you, and it was March 15?
@NyT62 @JLTrades Thank you for asking, only the city or state legislature can limit the number of for-hire vehicles.  It requires a change in the law.
