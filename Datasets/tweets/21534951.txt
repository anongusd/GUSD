there's a protective order regarding discovery. that sux.
To be clear: one's innocence is really between a person and his God. Guilt is another issue and whether prosecutors can prove he broke the law.
Another condition of release. Stone has to see the marshals to complete booking. This could interfere with an immediate news conference if Stone decides to hold one and declare his innocence.
He does appear to be sporting a blue pocket square.
Hard to tell from media room but it appears Stone is not wearing pinstripes.

For one thing, one of the payments to Mr. Edwards’s mistress took place as he was ending his candidacy, which further muddied how to interpret his motivation. By contrast, the payments to Ms. McDougal and Ms. Daniels came just ahead of the election.
The question, then, is whether prosecutors have more convincing factual evidence to present to a jury about Mr. Trump than they did in the case of Mr. Edwards. Legal experts pointed to several major differences.
Prosecutors failed to persuade a jury in that case -it established Justice Department and federal judge had endorsed idea that hush-money payments to a candidate’s mistress can be prosecuted as campaign-finance crimes — something that should give Mr. Trump little comfort.
But even though Mr. Edwards was not convicted, his case does not help Mr. Trump, said Peter Zeidenberg, a former federal prosecutor in the Justice Department’s public integrity section.
In both instances, law-enforcement officials have alleged elaborate and deceptive schemes to influence “an election from the shadows,”
A potential indictment of Mr. Trump for conspiring in the illegal campaign transactions to which Mr. Cohen has pleaded guilty would look a lot like the charges prosecutors brought against Mr. Edwards.
