@NancyPelosi @USCBO @HouseGOP It's truly striking to see how concerned you are over the deficit. I don't remember any of these remarks concerning the trainwreck that is Obamacare. ü§î
@Average_Skeptic @FoxNews @SarahPalinUSA That's inaccurate. The Constitution does not "Grant rights". It protects God given rights, and the right bear arms is one of them. Also, on your militia argument, you are wrong again.		https://t.co/bQVGmsibeT
@ChrisMurphyCT At least you acknowledge that you're irrelevant.
@SenMarkey Toxins*
A lot more people might vote Dem if they weren't afraid their Representatives would end up like you, who puts more emphasis on protecting illegal immigrants than actual citizens. Leave that #CaliforniaCorruption in your own district, and stop polluting the country. https://t.co/6zp0G5qulD
@linda_lindylou @realFireNunes @tedlieu @realDonaldTrump @DevinNunes That should start with moonbeam

@AbFabDarlings @DianeRadice @Twilson6209 @NealWCopeland1 @Jali_Cat @FLOTUS @StMarysMC @MELANIATRUMP If all you do is call everyone who disagrees with you a bot, you belittle your own arguments. Keep it up! You're doing great!!
@shannonrwatts @NRA Deflection is not a good look. Also, are you saying that women are incapable of lying? Should we just eliminate due process altogether?
This is the kind of garbage created by the extremist group led by @shannonrwatts. This rhetoric gives Democrats a bad name, and guess who has to explain it during one of their 40 interviews per week? https://t.co/4OJlDhp4Cm
@Twilson6209 @AbFabDarlings @DianeRadice @NealWCopeland1 @Jali_Cat @FLOTUS @StMarysMC @MELANIATRUMP Yup
@AbFabDarlings @DianeRadice @Twilson6209 @NealWCopeland1 @Jali_Cat @FLOTUS @StMarysMC @MELANIATRUMP Why call them a bot? Argue the point or move the fuck along.

The professional blouse and skirt shows @StormyDaniels is more than just the star of "Betty Cocker", "Meat Loving MILFs", "On Golden Blonde", "Pussy Sweat" and "Toxxxic Cumloads 6". She's an honorable and reliable source of information. https://t.co/m9jjq0fqAt

@HouseGOP This tweet is total deflection to pull attention from the fact that you just financed the democrats victory during the midterms. #Thanks
Well @realDonaldTrump, careful when you ask for earmarks, for when you do, you're all but guaranteed to get them...

@daniel_macelroy @milton_james7 @washingtonpost Anytime you end a tweet with "we'll wait", that is soliciting a response, or counterargument. To deny that is just silly on its face. 		You're just looking silly now. Wanna keep going? https://t.co/YFv3ILr5y9

@RepAndyBiggsAZ Man, that thing is long. I can't read all of that. Can you just tell me what's wrong with it? I have 3 press appearances today and just can't find the time to comb through it all...
@daniel_macelroy @milton_james7 @washingtonpost (1) if all you see in those is awkwardness, then clearly you are as sick as he is. (WTF???)		(2) how did an Alabama race come into this and how do you know if I did or did not 'go after' Roy Moore??		(3) you're arguing with a parody account.		May Nancy have mercy on your soul.
@daniel_macelroy @milton_james7 @washingtonpost Now you're just not making any sense. When you can look at those videos and photos and call them anything but gross, and somehow bring Trump into a conversation where he wasn't, you don't have to look further than the mirror to find the sick person.
@daniel_macelroy @milton_james7 @washingtonpost Please show where I "defended" anyone? You made this about Trump, not me. You were the only person in this conversation defending someone, and if those images and videos are acceptable or OK to you, then clearly you are as sexist and as sick as he is.
@NBCNews My 'strategy' of having no friends is finally taking off!!
@daniel_macelroy @milton_james7 @washingtonpost If you can't see what's wrong in those images and videos (multiple), then all hope of civil discourse with you is gone. It's not about defending anyone. You lost your argument and your credibility the second you made it about that. ‚úåÔ∏è
@CNN @CNNTravel These are not correct. The best place to visit in Mexico is Southern California.
@guardian There's nothing wrong here. I received an email from the Crown Prince of Nigeria. We're close. I even let him borrow some money so that he could unfreeze some very lucrative accounts. He's a nice guy. He promised to give me back 10 time what I gave him. Great deal!
@daniel_macelroy @milton_james7 @washingtonpost You're not very intelligent, are you? You must be a voter in my district.
@politico @POLITICOMag @sbg1 Listen, Hillary's dirty work is far more difficult to do. Instead of giving Republicans all the credit, you could give me some as well. I've worked hard to keep her investigation closed. Like 3-4 interviews per day hard!
@daniel_macelroy @milton_james7 @washingtonpost "out of context". Please explanation the context that makes any of that acceptable. 		https://t.co/p5MxYsdDaQ

@ChrisMurphyCT Chris this is important. Not the information, but the presentation. I need to be connected w/ your graphics department. I think my information will have more impact when placed on pretty graphics. This way, the #sheople focus on pretty pictures and not the silly things we say.
@RepAdamSchiff And I would know. I was on TV about 12 times this week and it's only Tuesday.
I would take offense to this, but then I'd just be lying, and I hear they're actually firing people for that now. Can you believe that? https://t.co/Xjq22zniO2
@EnergyCitizens I am not worried about National Security, for I alone will protect the universe. #IAmNotFullOfSchitt
One of these days I promise to focus on the district to which I represent, but it's hard to pass up all of this publicity. Especially if I'm expected to be a Senator from the great country of California.
@RepPeteAguilar Since you didn't approve the money for Sec. Carson's furniture, could you approve about $7,500 for a clothing allowance? I have like 8 interviews lined up over the next 4 days and I'm running out of suits! #InCaseYouDidNotKnowIAmFamous
@NancyPelosi Careful Nancy, next thing you know they'll be pointing out how long you've been in Congress without any "concrete steps" taken on...well... anything. Don't fall for that one!
As a representative of a district 1000+ miles away in a different state, I feel it's MY duty to say this to Texans &amp; all Americans, &amp; it has nothing to do with my wish to run for the US Senate. When this is solved, it will be because of me. https://t.co/PVtxBhQWdP
@HouseGOP Your tax plan cuts our ability to enjoy everything good about this town. Extravagant dinners, cocktail parties, fresh new suits, limos. What now? Are we supposed to Uber to interviews? I do close to 10 per week and that adds up. #TaxCutsandJobsAct
That's too obvious. We should've given them Hillary's hammers Nancy. #MissedOpportunities https://t.co/lbFNkopKgT
@CBSNews None of our work is biased. I have done countless interviews and have been in front of many cameras each day. I've even told things to the press that I wasn't supposed to, and I don't like the nickname, "Little Adam Schiff". Also I'm from the opposition party, but not biased.
@JimCarrey That's great work Jim! Please, do me next...

Unfortunately, the current POTUS is eating all of the cows. 3 burgers per day is what I'm told by my undercover sources in the WH kitchen. At that rate, there will be now cows left to poop by the end of his 1st term. This keeps big #Oil in business. #inpeach https://t.co/WGeZKqzUvs
@RepLowenthal @HouseGOP Please stop stealing my spotlight. This is not your fight. I will handle all public interviews concerning this that include cameras.
As I've said before, waiting for trivial things like evidence is a waste of time. I'm a busy guy. I have at least five interviews lined up today. https://t.co/NLO08qDTok

@OliMauritania As I've said before, Americans are not smart enough to understand the complexities surrounding how absolutely awesome I am. I'm multi-layered in amazingness. TV people wait for me to come out of meetings. I'm kind of a big deal.
