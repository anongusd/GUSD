@ShakaThaGod No. I really dont
@DeepStateExpose On these pics earlier, Kennedy was already grasping at his neck. Jackie appears to be trying to find out what happened. The Govenor was closest to him. How did he get missed of the driver shot him? I'm just throwing out questions.
I'm suspecting something was happening behind the sign. 	I can't get frame 227 tho. 	Was it cut out? 	227 when replayed doesn't show up. 226 then jumps to 228.	@DeepStateExpose https://t.co/QBOwh7Eet9
