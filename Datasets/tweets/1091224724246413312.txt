@CNN I‚Äôm def one of those dems.I‚Äôll take anyone that can beat him but I‚Äôm thinking Sherrod Brown might b one possible candidate that can win the hearts and minds of the left and still be popular enough with so called independents to win the general. There‚Äôs a good group of candidates.
@Kanew Klobuchar and Beto come across as very decent and intelligent people but I‚Äôd like to see/hear more. I like Biden BUT I‚Äôm not sure whether I‚Äôd be happy about him running or not, I think he‚Äôs a little too eager to make nice with the likes of McConnell and other bad faith actors.
@Kanew I‚Äôm hoping Sherrod Brown runs because he seems like he‚Äôs the most in touch with the concerns of the average American. I also like Harris, she‚Äôs clearly smart as heck and unafraid and has charisma too. Warren is great on economic policy.Booker and Gillibrand would be hard to trust
