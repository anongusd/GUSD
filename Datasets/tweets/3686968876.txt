@Izamuhaye True. But quality seeds is one thing, accessibility and usability is another one. channels through which these agricultural improved inputs reach farmers will determine the output/quality/quantity/food security/food safety.	-easy accessibility  - Time it takes   -Knowledge

@g_mukeshimana @ryaf_agribiz @RwandaAgri @RwandAgriExport @RwandaAgriBoard @PSF_Rwanda Very nice to see. Great achievement. More are yet to come. We are grateful of the conducive environment,support..that eases Rwandan Agriculture transformation. Youth inclusion and focus have changed big thing these days
@Izamuhaye @RwandaNorth This increasing acreage reflects the level at which we are in terms of Land use consolidating/Crop intensification program in general . It is promising that the future Food security is ensured. Only need to increase the usage of improved seeds and fertilizers
@gatjmv @AkayezuJa @GicumbiDistrict @MusanzeDistrict @BureraDistrict @RwandaAgriBoard @g_mukeshimana @RwandaNorth Sounds very nice and the price looks quite good. We wish SPF to work with farmers cooperatives in multiplication of those improved seeds and to establish more than one selling point especially in @GicumbiDistrict

@PostharvestOrg Mechanization doesn‚Äôt mean buying any kind of tractor. Some factors implies:	-size of the land	- type of crop	-power/capacity of the tractor	-efficiency	-Number of hours it can work in a day/week/month/year	-Maintenance...		Also, labor is the expensive factor of production today
@PostharvestOrg Rice,wheat,maize, carrots...	Here we do comparison.	That‚Äôs why for grains, we have what we call headed , broken and big broken that are sold at different prices means  that it try to minimize the loss compared to when you use manual where most of grains remain in stalks, brand...
@PostharvestOrg My question is still not answered. How can Mechanized Postharvesting cause lots of damage compared to manual????	That is not possible. May b you can share with me ur experience on this
