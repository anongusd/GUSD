@naturetechfam @MIMI_Ranger It's an amazing building for an important story! #parkchat
Q8 #ParkChat  The best part of social media is that it‚Äôs exactly that ‚Äì social. Does social media have the potential to create a more personal connection between parks and visitors versus other media?
@terragalleria That's a goal of parks using social media. We really want to guide people to the great content on park websites! #parkchat
Q7 #ParkChat  For many parks, social media is one of many duties performed by staff.  It can be impacted by workload, schedules, etc. Is it important for parks to invest in social media or should they focus on more traditional media tools or venues?
Q6 #ParkChat  Social media has been a great tool for showcasing lesser known park sites. Has social media inspired you to visit a place you might never thought about visiting?
@naturetechfam @Wild_Tribute @WindCaveNPS Never enough bison or prairie dogs! #ParkChat
Q5 #ParkChat  Our pages often use humor, graphics, and even a few pop culture references to make park connections. What type of social media content do you find engaging and inspiring? Can we all agree we need a bison emjoi?

Q4 #ParkChat  From taking selfies to planning trips, has social media changed the way you experience parks?
