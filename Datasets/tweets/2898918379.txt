@realDonaldTrump You have someone hired to pay off your adversaries but not to proofread your Tweets?
@ShaleeKathryn One of my biggest Facebook pet peeves!!!!!!! 😑😑😑😑
@ShaleeKathryn Baby dill pickles = lyfe
@RepFredUpton Just not the resources they need when their commands aren’t taking care of them.
@miranda_byerr I don’t appreciate the lack of “reactions” on twitter.
@miranda_byerr It’s cause you have no friends. 😘😘😘😘
@ShaleeKathryn I think you’re great!!!! Taylor’s lucky! ❤️❤️❤️
@Lcamling Loovveee yyoouuu!!!!! 😬😬😬❤️
Okay sure! I’ll just be awake for the next five weeks. At least there’s cobbler though. 🤔🤔
Perfect. That was fun while it lasted. https://t.co/TA83xkUDOs
@ShaleeKathryn Cause you’re ahhhmaazzziinnngggg ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
@vet_merica1987 I wasn’t talking about you....I don’t even know you.
@RepFredUpton Just received an email from him! Thanks again.
When someone is supporting a public office representative because he “talks to him all the time,” tells you that a Twitter message isn’t significant enough to get anyone’s attention and then deletes it to make it seem like people are feeling helpless and hopeless for no reason.😂
@vet_merica1987 We’ve been reaching out to the congressman’s office over and over again with the promise that he’ll call us back. He even went so far on Thursday as to say, “I spoke with [his veteran’s affairs aid] personally, he’ll be in contact shortly.” Probably just to shut us up.
If our elected officials won’t take care of us, who do we turn to? The feeling of helplessness that’s swept the entire nation affects us all the way to the individual level. #repfredupton #michigandistrict6
@RepFredUpton Was there something else we needed to do? Two more fruitless attempts and messages left since Thursday. We’re desperate for guidance.
@RepFredUpton Thank you, Sir. That means a lot to my family.
@RepFredUpton That’s the number we’ve been using to no avail, unfortunately. Usually he’s in a meeting, not in, or we leave a message and that’s where it ends. Thank you for responding.
@RepFredUpton My boyfriend is deployed and needs help! He's been calling and leaving messages with the promises of a return call and then silence. What can we do to be important enough to deserve a spot in Mr. Dillon's schedule? He could really use some guidance!

@mcdrake_ How do you feel about this? Fox remaking 'Rocky Horror Picture Show'   http://t.co/l0KlK4M7Rc via @EW
@mcdqq pretty much exactly the same things now that I think about it.
@mcdqq Economics is certainly not theoretical physics. You have changed.
@mcdqq do you still happen to have that banner I made you?
@mcdqq pretty good I think. I really like stats...and you know, still hate Spanish.
@mcdqq my classes have an 8 week turnover. I only have 4 weeks in between exams.
Midterms - officially done. Hallelujah.

Did news get put on hold for the Ferguson riots? Alright guys, no one do anything newsworthy for a couple of days. We won't be listening.
@wzzm13  Holy crap, peacefully? They still get media coverage? Crazy how that works. I thought you had to burn down buildings to be heard.

Just saw @PitsNParolees_ for the first time, cried my eyes out, and found a new life dream.
@MirandaLyn5 I definitely just called David by your name.
You have got to be out of your fucking mind.
I can't handle this stress in my life.
NOW we're talking. Keep on trucking along now. #ColtsNation
Safe and steady wins this race.
Sure is a great day to be a @Colts fan.
@MirandaLyn5 pt jacket?
I hate this "favorite" thing. Just because I enjoyed reading your tweet does not mean it's my favorite.
@MirandaLyn5 are...you going to be there all night or something? Haha. You'd be coming to hang out with David though because I have to study
@MirandaLyn5 got ready so you could come over to your sister's house? Also, I think I retweeted this by accident.
I'm way too old for this shit.
So many exams so little time.
