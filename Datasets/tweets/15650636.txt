@BobMoss37 Not sure if you mean the salt or the egg factory but either way the answer is yes. Male chickens have no value to the egg industry.
Please stop eating eggs ✋ 🛑 There are plenty of substitutes and if you sprinkle some kala namak salt on it, the sulfur in the salt makes anything taste just like eggs! https://t.co/lkmDXQUeNG

6/ It's hard to walk away from something I've loved for so long. 18 years, don't they go by in a blink.
5/ ...had the cards fallen another way, we had a shot to win this weekend. I want to thank Venturini Motorsports and everyone who has supported me on this journey. Some tears fell under my helmet after I crossed the finish line for the last time on my final lap.
4/ I had to come back down pit road for new tires and finished a bittersweet 15th. We had a great run and were in contention for a top 5 finish on Saturday. Things didn't fall our way, as they often don't at Daytona, but we showed we could run up front and...
3/ On the restart with just 5 laps to go, I was scored in 5th place before losing position when the restart went three-wide with me stuck in the middle lane. Then, on the second to last lap, I got a flat tire while driving through and avoiding a wreck happening in turn 3.
2/ A slow stop due to an equipment problem lost us a lot of positions and I came back on track from the pit stop in 19th. Frustrating! I raced my way all the way back to 6th place by lap 63 and held that position until the final 5-laps of the race. https://t.co/OV3cAMN5T8
1/ In the final race of my career I qualified 3rd in the No.55 @wthfilm racecar for Venturini Motorsports. We stayed up front and at the halfway point in the race I was running 4th. A caution came out on lap 43 so I came in for a pit stop along with the rest of the leaders. https://t.co/HQpYlY3DtN

@ODanaos @crownjuul @thatdutchperson Please look up the definition of vegan. Whether an animal is a mammal or not has no relevance. No animal products. Period. Including chicken periods. https://t.co/zdqAMSuEff
@ODanaos @crownjuul @thatdutchperson Huh? Vegans don't eat or drink any animal products: no meat, fish, eggs or dairy. It has nothing to do with whether an animal is a mammal or not.
@crownjuul @thatdutchperson This is exactly right. If you think about what the food on your plate actually is, you would be vegan like me. Better for the planet, the animals, and your health. Plus, not gross.

@kkarra99 @TrendsVlog @Tesla @PopnMatters 1) Not crazy, simple math, continuing our current population growth is crazy. 2) Raising a child vegan is no guarantee they stay vegan and vegans still have a carbon footprint 3) If you want to be a parent, why not adopt one of the 153 miilion orphan children in need of a home?

@jbeachbum30 @TrendsVlog @Tesla @PopnMatters Thanks for your thoughtful, informed responses Jonathan. Some people have the surprising ability to ignore science and data. It is the lack of belief in science and lack of empathy for other humans and animals that disappoints me about humanity the most.
@TrendsVlog @jbeachbum30 @Tesla @PopnMatters Wow, that is a really horrific comment and does not reflect well on who you are as a person.
@jbeachbum30 @TrendsVlog @Tesla @PopnMatters Exactly, the people who have kids should be thankful their children and grandchildren will have a less crowded, cleaner, more sustainable world because of people who have chosen to not have kids. They can’t see the forest for the trees.
@TrendsVlog @jbeachbum30 @Tesla @PopnMatters Yes because destroying the world around us and all the species we share it with is so funny lol https://t.co/ikUn3NO6AG
@TrendsVlog @jbeachbum30 @Tesla @PopnMatters By the way, for those who want to be parents, there are 153 million orphan children already here on Earth that are in need of a home. No need to have your own kids when there are so many already out there waiting to find families.
@TrendsVlog @jbeachbum30 @Tesla @PopnMatters Sounds like a cancer cell, endlessly dividing &amp; growing with no care for the destruction it causes. The ultimate intelligence of our species will be determined by whether or not we get population under control before we destroy biodiversity &amp; ecosystems that support life on Earth
This is sound advice that I should probably listen to. https://t.co/QwNCd7B7NI
@TrendsVlog @Tesla @PopnMatters We are driving species to extinction at a rate 1000x faster than the natural background rate. I worked on a film about it called @RacingXtinction Yet according to you, everything is fine because we will create technology to fix it, and discussing population is fear mongering? https://t.co/uNDRuMmUhU
@TrendsVlog @Tesla @PopnMatters Humans are 0.01% of all living things and yet we have already destroyed 83% of all wild mammals and 50% of all plants. Of all mammals on Earth, 60% are now livestock, 36% are humans, and just 4% are wild animals. Farmed poultry makes up 70% of all birds on the planet.
Very frustrated with people pressuring me to have children. I have stated clearly since my early 20s (when my biochemistry professor at @UCSDalumni showed a film on population in class) that I'm not having children. Ever since I've had to listen to people say things like this... https://t.co/npY3jxwZJi
@TrendsVlog @Tesla @PopnMatters It's not sad at all. My husband and I are very happily child-free. Population is the greatest issue of our time which is why I joined Sir David Attenborough and Jane Goodall as a patron of @PopnMatters
@TrendsVlog @Tesla @PopnMatters A child born in the first world has a much bigger ecological impact/carbon footprint on the planet than a child born in the third world. For every 1 billion people added to the planet (every 12 years currently) comes 10 billion farm animals at our current rate of meat consumption
@TrendsVlog @Tesla No, I won't. We are currently adding 1 billion people to the planet every 12 years, this is not sustainable. I talked to my friends at @PopnMatters about my reasons why: https://t.co/Y0K5UgeaMC
Wrong, we now have the ability to appreciate wild animals in their natural environments through film. My niece loves dinosaurs.

@StanleyNormoyle During college I volunteered for several years at a wildlife rescue, rehabilitation and release organization. We never put the rescue animals on display or made any money off of them and released them to the wild as soon as they were able - big difference in the two approaches.

@StanleyNormoyle Animal rescue and rehabilitation should be done at animal sanctuaries, not zoos, for all the reasons listed in my thread.

@matdodd @naomi2009 @dudleyzoo Then perhaps do not have a zoo so close to a heavily populated area where if a zookeeper makes a mistake - as they did in this case, leaving an enclosure door open - an innocent snow leopard does not get murdered.

*healthy population* is what I meant to type in 6/
@NBCNews Actual murderers high-fiving. Both have ordered journalists to be killed. Surreal.
10/ Humans are driving species to extinction at a rate 1000x faster than the natural background rate. I worked on a film about the 6th mass extinction of species called @RacingXtinction if you would like to learn more.
9/ It is clear that captivity is not the way to save these species with any quality of life considered. As a child, I loved going to zoos because I loved animals. Now as an adult, I will never go to a zoo for the same reason.
8/ Instead of spending money on zoos, non-profit sanctuaries and wildlife conservation parks that allow the animals to live and thrive in the wild are a much better use of funds to protect wild species.
7/ Anytime humans are making a profit off of animals, the welfare of the animals suffer; e.g. horse racing, greyhound racing, puppy mills, circuses, zoos, etc.
6/ When zoos pull animals from wild populations to put on display, they cause further stress by both reducing the number of animals from the wild but also genetic variability needed for a health population.
5/ Caged wild animals often display poor health; e.g. orcas with collapsed dorsal fins, teeth grinding and often have a far shorter lifetimes than their counterparts in the wild.
4/This causes both physical and mental deterioration in the animals and puts into question their quality of life. Caged animals show often show distress with unnatural repetitive behaviors such as pacing and walking in tight circles.
3/ Many animals who would in the wild be found in herds or pods are isolated in zoos, lacking the social and familial bonds that come naturally to them in addition to lack of stimulation they would find in the wild.
2/ Even IF they make their best effort, zoos and aquariums cannot replicate the natural habitat of wild animals and in turn natural behaviors such as roaming, socializing, foraging for food, finding a mate, are missing from the animals life.
1/ Happy to answer this question but there are many reasons so I will thread them below https://t.co/fRYK4JXRR7

@JEV1A I’m not trying to get him to a shelter, I’m trying to get him to where he wants to go - to the place that is his home, Moab.
Friends in Utah: please read in case you know anyone who can help this man with a #RideToMoab https://t.co/CSzhbxpDdZ
7/ His name is Cary and he has grey hair, a kind weathered face, and was wearing a black baseball cap. #RideToMoab
6/ where I think he is sleeping. We met at the Sinclair at the corner of N. 1000 E Blvd and 34, circled in blue. The arrow is where he pointed to where he was camping. If anyone is headed to Moab and has it in their heart, he seems like a really nice man who could use a ride. https://t.co/hGm2CKhBxz
5/ but after I left to the airport I regretted that I didn’t do more to help. If I had more time before my flight maybe I could have bought him a bus ticket to Moab. Anyway I’m sitting at the airport now waiting for my flight and I’ve figured out where the gas station is and
4/ “Ok so you have a tent, you have some shelter?” I asked. “No tent, I’m a minimalist.” He does have a sleeping bag but it is getting cold in Utah. He told me he wants to start hitchhiking back to Moab tonight. I had to catch my flight so we shook hands and said our good byes,
3/ Went back outside, he was so thankful for the food “You made my day!” I asked him how he ended up out here. He said he is from Moab and he came here with a friend but the friend took off so now he is alone and camping in the hills near the gas station.
2/ He wasn’t asking for any help but I got the feeling he was hard on his luck. I asked him if he could use a cup of coffee. Yes, he said. I went inside and bought the healthier snacks I could find at the gas station: nuts, fruit, trail mix and a hot coffee.
Thread: 1/ Today I was in St George, Utah. I was here for a screening of Racing Extinction yesterday. On my way to the airport, I spotted an older man sitting quietly with a small backpack behind a gas station.

An Uber driver published video of a private conversation of NHL players in his car. Should @Uber and @lyft make it company policy that their drivers cannot release videos of their customers with the exception of a criminal complaint?
I agree. @Uber @lyft need to address in their agreement with drivers that publishing videos of their customers (with the exception of criminal complaints) is a violation of company policy. This Ottawa @Senators video is an outrageous violation of privacy. https://t.co/mVprLwV5NW

We’re at Charlotte VegFest today from 11am-4pm with the No. 20 Vegan Strong @VenturiniMotor racecar that I will be racing at @kansasspeedway next Friday! We have diecasts of the racecar as well as our @TheVegNation t-shirts! Come say hello - 800 Briar Creek Road in Charlotte! https://t.co/QfXVA0o4UE

Via @RoadandTrack “The all-woman W Series is tone deaf and does a disservice to talented racers, according to Lyn St. James and Cindi Lux.” I agree. https://t.co/iOCAk2A5qk
@teslanomicsco @_jeffreyr Simple - if there is a physical disadvantage to the female competitors. Car racing, horse racing and equestrian riding are sports where men and women compete against each other as equals because physical strength is not a factor.

Dear diary, It’s 2018. Women are racing against men in various series around the world. Yet for some inexplicable reason the powers-that-be have decided to create an all-female racing series, segregating men and women in a sport where they already compete as equals. https://t.co/klwsKwV6Om

@SetthemF Not the same. Do you drive a car to work? Fly on airplanes to see family or vacation? Fossil fuels are part of all our lives like it or not. Unlike most, I offset the fuel I use at work &amp; drive an electric car powered by solar away from track. Attacking your allies, good choice!

1/ CORRECTION: I was recently told by a Tesla employee (who had incorrect info) that all steering wheels in the Tesla Model 3 are vegan.

2/ Many of the former-orphaned elephants have now given birth to healthy wild-born calves. I discovered DSWT through @KristinDavis and her beautiful documentary film Gardeners of Eden. If you watch it, I bet you’ll be fostering an orphan elephant by the end of the credits too! 🐘
1/ Just renewed my fostering of Ndotto, an orphan baby elephant who was only 2 days old when he was rescued by @dswt. DSWT has successfully hand-raised over 150 infant orphan elephants and have effectively reintroduced them into the wild herds of Tsavo. https://t.co/Cu2aJqEGoZ

@FDesimpel @RaceTalkRadio @PopnMatters @PopulationMedia @HavingKids @TNREthx @RacingXtinction @OP_Society Every single environmental crisis we face: climate change, ocean acidification, habitat loss, pollution, species extinction - all of them are accelerated by our rapidly growing population. We cannot address the others without addressing the core issue of the problem.
@FDesimpel @RaceTalkRadio @PopnMatters @PopulationMedia @HavingKids @TNREthx Human impact is currently driving species to extinction at a rate 1000x faster than the natural background rate. I worked on a documentary called @RacingXtinction about the 6th mass extinction with the Academy Award winning team at @OP_Society
@FDesimpel @RaceTalkRadio @PopnMatters @PopulationMedia @HavingKids @TNREthx Of all mammals on Earth, 60% are now livestock, 36% are humans, and just 4% are wild animals. Farmed poultry makes up 70% of all birds on the planet, with just 30% being wild.
@FDesimpel @RaceTalkRadio @PopnMatters @PopulationMedia @HavingKids @TNREthx Humans represent just 0.01% of all living things and yet in our short time here we have already had a catastrophic effect on the natural world: we have destroyed 83% of all wild mammals and 50% of all plants.
@FDesimpel @RaceTalkRadio @PopnMatters @PopulationMedia @HavingKids @TNREthx According to a year-long study by ecologists at Cornell University the carrying capacity of the Earth (should all people be living in relative prosperity with access to electricity and clean drinking water) is 2 billion. Clean energy, veganism and electric cars could increase it.
@FDesimpel @RaceTalkRadio Important to note difference between population growth and population growth rate. Even as growth rate slows, the # of people increasing at that lower rate is larger so population increases, currently by ~83M people per year. https://t.co/jd5RAWIsk8

@kowloonsunday The difference between partial and total is like watching a skydiving video vs jumping out of the airplane. It’s not in the same realm, they should have completely different names as the two experiences don’t share anything in common. Don’t miss the line of totality next time!

@lork99 Awesome so you have experienced totality - was it not the most amazing thing you've ever seen? Blew my mind.
@CameronLee250 Oh I'm so sorry, that is so awful. Try to get to the path of totality again so you have another chance to see it.
@lork99 There were no total solar eclipses in 2018 so I assume you mean the total lunar eclipse on Jan 31? If you haven't seen a total solar eclipse, trust me that's the one you need to see.
@jeffrey_ventre It was truly the most beautiful thing I have ever seen in my life. I can't wait to see it again. Some nights when I can't sleep, I watch videos from people experiencing totality for the first time.
Anyone going to Chile/Argentina for #TotalSolarEclipse 2019? Most totality tours are sold out so I'm trying to make my own plans, could use any tips the twitter universe can offer. After experiencing totality for the first time last year, I'm hooked #TotalityOrBust #EclipseChaser

@aspenjfm @michaelpollan Hi Jerry, hope you &amp; Gina are well! At current meat consumption rate 10B farm animals are needed for every 1B people (which we add every 12 yrs) Already today one third of the arable land on the planet is being used to grow food for livestock. Not sustainable, don't you agree?
@TroyOttAg @TNREthx @PopnMatters @PopulationMedia @alexandra_paul @HavingKids @RacingXtinction @OP_Society @louiepsihoyos @UNEnvironment @earthxorg I hope you're right but until tech solves these problems, reducing population growth puts less pressure on urgent environmental problems: climate change, ocean acidification, species extinction, habitat destruction, pollution, etc...
@TroyOttAg @TNREthx @PopnMatters @PopulationMedia @alexandra_paul @HavingKids @RacingXtinction @OP_Society @louiepsihoyos @UNEnvironment @earthxorg And yet 1 in 9 people today lack access to safe water; 1 in 3 lack access to a toilet, oceans are acidifying, 83% of wild mammals are gone, species are going extinct at a rate 1000x faster than natural background rate. Will not place my bet on "Don't worry, tech will save us all"
@TroyOttAg @TNREthx @PopnMatters @PopulationMedia @alexandra_paul @HavingKids @RacingXtinction @OP_Society @louiepsihoyos @UNEnvironment @earthxorg It was not one ecologist, the Cornell study was a year-long, peer-reviewed study by a collaboration of scientists: https://t.co/XJ6TsqOxBt
@TroyOttAg @TNREthx @PopnMatters @PopulationMedia @alexandra_paul @HavingKids @RacingXtinction @OP_Society @louiepsihoyos @UNEnvironment @earthxorg According to a study published by Cornell ecologists that is 9B over the carrying capacity of Earth (should everyone be living in relative prosperity). I get that vegan food, electric cars, and renewable energy can increase carrying capacity, but surely not from 2B to 11B.
@TroyOttAg @PopnMatters @PopulationMedia @TNREthx @alexandra_paul @HavingKids @RacingXtinction @OP_Society @louiepsihoyos @UNEnvironment @earthxorg The problem with looking at the slowing of growth rate and getting hopeful is when that graph started it was 1950 we had 2.5 billion people, now we have 7.6 billion - so even with a slower growth rate we are still adding more people net now than we were back then.
I made a sign. 		Human Population:	1 Billion: 1804	2 Billion: 1930	3 Billion: 1960	4 Billion: 1974	5 Billion: 1987	6 Billion: 1999	7 Billion: 2011 https://t.co/2JPSc5jSuP

4/ Unsurprisingly, Earth Overshoot Day lands earlier on our calendar every year. #EarthOvershootDay #MoveTheDate #RacingExtinction
3/ For every billion people comes 10 billion farm animals at our current rate of meat consumption. Every single environmental crisis we face: climate change, ocean acidification, habitat loss, pollution, species extinction - all are accelerated by our rapidly growing population.
2/ Of all mammals on Earth, 60% are now livestock, 36% are humans, and just 4% are wild animals. Farmed poultry makes up 70% is all the birds on the planet, with just 30% being wild. We are adding 1 billion people to our planet every 12 years.
Thread: 1/ Today is 2018’s Earth Overshoot Day - the date marked each year when we have used more from nature than our planet can renew in the entire year. Humans are only .01% of all living things yet we have already destroyed 83% of all wild mammals and 50% of all plants. https://t.co/JtG7W0ncmL

Have you heard of the greenhouse effect? You should have learned about it in 6th grade science. (Thx J Fourier, C Poillet, J Tyndall, S Arrhenius) CO2 is a greenhouse gas. Humans emitted 32.5 gigatons of GHGs in 2017. This is simple math, not rocket science. #Data https://t.co/ZvTV9dJvm3

Instead of “Otherwise we are up shit creek without a paddle” at the UN I said “The future of life on Earth depends upon us taking action” but otherwise, pretty much the same :)
@sindyesli @mzjacobson @EcoWatch After a year-long study at Cornell, ecologists agreed the carrying capacity of Earth is 2 billion, assuming all to be living in relative prosperity with access to clean water and electricity. We are already 5.6 billion over that with a growth rate of 1 billion every 12 years.

This thread is a summary of my speech at the United Nations last night, in six tweets: https://t.co/6XtungS0DA
6// Humans must show evolutionary adaptation by reducing population growth and meat consumption, as welll as replacing fossil fuel economy with a renewable energy economy. Otherwise we are up shit creek without a paddle.
5/ Every single environmental crisis we face: climate change, ocean acidification, habitat loss, pollution, species extinction - all of them are accelerated by our rapidly growing population. We cannot address the others without addressing the core issue of the problem.
4/ Charles Darwin once said “It is not the strongest of the species that survives, nor the most intelligent that survives. It is the one that is most adaptable to change.”
3/ We are adding 1 billion people to our planet every 12 years and for every billion people comes 10 billion farm animals at our current rate of meat consumption. This is not sustainable.
2/ Of all mammals on Earth, 60% are now livestock, 36% are humans, and just 4% are wild animals. Farmed poultry makes up 70% of all birds on the planet, with just 30% being wild. How sad is it that most of the birds on Earth are not able to fly. That’s what wings are for.
1/ Humans are the most dangerous animal on Earth. We represent just 0.01% of all living things and yet in our short time here we have already had a catastrophic effect on the natural world: we have destroyed 83% of all wild mammals and 50% of all plants.

PS. My apologies to the people seated around us who have no interest in cars but had to listen to our Tesla debate from Phoenix to Charlotte.  I’m sorry, I had no choice in the matter. https://t.co/4RtQP7ApAM
In the end his reaction might be summed up best by this gif https://t.co/JrlWWQiVLC
I explained the benefits beyond gas savings: lack of maintenance needed, how few moving parts an AC induction electric motor has vs. an internal combustion engine. I believe he was genuinely surprised to meet a woman who knew cars as well, or more likely better, than he did :)
He kept arguing profitability and saying “Jaguar and BMW will have electric cars better than Tesla soon.” I asked when? And where is their supercharging infrastructure? Then I showed him this map of the Tesla charging network: https://t.co/0VJ61GfWHO
The quietest moment of our talk was after I said “In 2013 Tesla paid back their $451M federal loan 9 years early with interest so tax payers actually made money off the Tesla loan, and they also became the first American car company to have ever fully repaid the government.”
I told him “no better way for you to judge the product than with your own 2 feet on the pedals and your own 2 hands on the wheel” and he agreed. He was BIG TIME anti-Tesla three hours ago and his tune has changed ever so slightly. Will update after his test drive, if it happens.
Just landed - we argued fossil fuel subsidies, supercharger infrastructure, etc and I won him over enough to exchange our info so he can test drive of my Model S (Tesla Charlotte can’t give test drives because it was blocked by Sonic along with the 3 other dealerships)
So far he has told me "Tesla is breaking the law" to which I responded it is unconstitutional to regulate interstate commerce. Then he said "Tesla will be out of business soon" to which I responded "They have taken 500,000 orders for the Model 3."

@thehiwaystar @evchels @Total @Tesla LOL he went from telling me he’s a “big fan” and following me to blocking me because I responded to his crtiticism. Ok, Tim Martin, have a good one!
@thehiwaystar @evchels @Total @Tesla All I stated were facts: my personal car is electric and solar-powered, how much gas is burned in the few races I run, and that I have offset the fuel since 2007. If you find me stating simple facts as holier-than-thou then that’s on you.
@She_sElectric @FullyChargedShw I can’t be there, I’m racing in the @ARCA_Racing Series at @MISpeedway in the No. 20 #VeganStrong entry for @VenturiniMotor that weekend.
@thehiwaystar @evchels @Total @Tesla Not quite. Since 2013 my personal car is a @Tesla and I’ve driven over 75k miles powered by solar when charging at home. The racecar uses 30 gallons per race and I’ll run 8 this year. Usually I run 1 or 2 races per year. I’ve adopted an acre of rainforest for each race since 2007
At the end of the day, as the CEO of @Total both his paycheck and bonus relies on the selling of oil so I doubt he is truly pro-EV. @Tesla is the most successful EV brand and is therefore the one he criticizes. https://t.co/Jmjl2i5oPX

Wow, that is quite a jump you made there! One day I’m an educated, happily married child-free woman and the next I’m committing suicide/murder 😂 https://t.co/q2OQoV65US
I meant to say "carrying capacity of the Earth." Wish we had a @Twitter edit button!
They were both adopted. “If my mother had her own children,” Anna said, “she never would have found me. Thank you for talking about the orphans, it means the world to me and so many others.”
For people who cannot deny the need to be parents, there are 138 million orphan children in the world in need of a home. When I addressed population in Aspen in summer 2016, after my talk I had these two beautiful young girls, Zoë &amp; Anna, come thank me for talking about orphans.
We currently have 7.6 billion people on the planet with a growth rate of 1 billion every 12 yrs. My husband &amp; I are child free by choice for these reasons. I want more of us to feel comfortable talking about this issue – parents &amp; non-parents – because we need to talk about this.

@BassTrilogy War is NOT necessary. When women and girls have access to education, freedom, and economic empowerment, they choose to have smaller families
@MitchFilmCritic Thank you!
@alanjames @HansRosling Oh, ok - that's only 8 billion over the carrying capacity of the planet we're on. We are on a finite planet with finite resources. Last year Earth Overshoot Day was Aug 2: https://t.co/Tjsz8ANsUI
Humans took 200,000 years to reach a population of 1 billion. 	1 Billion: 1804	2 Billion: 1930	3 Billion: 1960	4 Billion: 1974	5 Billion: 1987	6 Billion: 1999	7 Billion: 2011
It took humans 200,000 years to reach 1 billion people. It took us only 126 years to add the next billion. 30 years for our third billion. We’re now at 7.6 billion and adding 1 billion people every 12 years. https://t.co/hvFhXlP1rB
@shift______ @therealautoblog 1) Do not mistake population growth decline with population decline. 2) The carbon footprint of a child born in a first world country is many times more than a child born in a third world country.
@therealautoblog I made the decision to be child-free when I was 21 after my college biochemistry professor screened a film about population. I’m 44 now, so that vow was made about 23 years ago.

@tschenck55 Being child-free is the biggest impact, after that: go vegan, drive electric, and put up solar panels! And perhaps most important: educate those around you :)
Yes, I think it is the most overlooked/ignored issue. Climate change, ocean acidification, species extinction, loss of biodiversity – overpopulation compounds every single one of them. If we don't address population, we are ignoring the root cause of all these other issues. https://t.co/jwBRouiR1j

@Dannylehmkuhl @TheOrangeCone I’ve driven 70,000 miles in my Tesla since 2013 and the vast majority of electrons came from the solar panels on the roof of my house.
@Dannylehmkuhl @TheOrangeCone Even if you charge an EV in West Virginia, the state with the highest ratio of coal supplying the grid, your CO2 emissions are less than gasoline. Happy to provide details if you are truly interested.
@PippaMann @hmadair23 @LucasRaceSchool @INDonorNetwork @ClausonMarshall @Driven2Save Very cool! Good luck to you @hmadair23! Pippa, I love how you lift up upcoming female racers. 👊
@Dannylehmkuhl @TheOrangeCone Electricity is needed to refine oil, and then you burn more fuel moving it to gas stations. Not to mention my AC induction motor is far more efficient than ICE, over 80% vs 17-21% energy to the wheel.
@TheOrangeCone Falcon Heavy has 5.1 million pounds at max thrust, or 2300 metric tons. She is an absolute beast.
Huge thank you to @SpaceX - after testing Daytona we drove the Tesla down to Cape Canaveral to get a look at Falcon Heavy, the most powerful current rocket on Earth. She is a massive monster of a rocket, can’t wait to see her blast off to space https://t.co/aut31Yi1S2
