@MeghanMcCain You have a problem with it because your father betrayed Conservatives, his constituents in AZ, so they have little room praising him anymore. His bitterness cast such a huge shadow over any good he did, they simply won't cheer for him anymore, and shouldn't. #mccainisatraitor
@redskinstoday_ To what end? A season or 2 of better offense? The dude has it made in Pittsburgh and doesn't realize it. Wait til he gets here and sees there is currently no QB and not much of a surrounding cast. How about we build the team the way champions build, in the trenches!
@NickTGraphics @LakeLewis He depends entirely too much on his physical ability, and took a lot of hard hits going for more than he should, instead of throwing it away, or going out of bounds...trying to get a little more each play instead of preserving his body. Just like RG3, less like RW.
@LakeLewis Oh Drew Brees! Oh Russell Wilson! **sarcasm alert** I saw too many of Murray's games to believe he's any more than RG3 dressed up in a different package. Murray depends on his physical abilities far more than QB acumen...that will get him killed the same as RG3...and quicker.
@LeslieMarshall @AOC It has nothing to do with your description of her, it is because she lacks experience, understanding, and depth to be where she is. It is her puppet master pulling her strings because she is young, female and Hispanic. #saikatistherealbrainsinthatdistrict
@LakeLewis Sure, and LB's continue to get burned, our OL remains a turnstile of injury, the young studs on our DL get worn, and our secondary is torched w/o pressure on the edge. But hey, we've got a dynamic young QB who is too small, a WR who is too small, and a prima dona! Success!
@arielhelwani Jon Jones gets ko'ed tomorrow night!
@MeghanMcCain @HuntsmanAbby I just wish someone would have asked you father why he lied to the people of AZ to repeal ACA. Oh that's rightsomeone did, he attacked them for suggesting he was that petty...WHEN IN FACT HE WAS!!! 		https://t.co/xeKlRtV4Tp
@MatthewBetley @TrueDetective And another thing...just kidding. Let's talk about the Democrats who voted to kill babies!
@stephenasmith Take a look at this clip and tell me Lebron is the example of "urgency". 		https://t.co/Px8yId70WT
@MatthewBetley @TrueDetective I think he did too much jumping around from the 4 different periods of their lives. And in many cases, it was so quick...seemingly to intentionally throw the viewer out of sync with what was happening, or thought was happening. I get the "mystery" of it all, but it was jumbled.
@MatthewBetley @TrueDetective Thought he did a great job, as well as Ali. I think the production was as good as it gets, but Pizzolato missed the mark on the storyline once again. After hitting a HR in the 1st season, he grounded out in the 2nd and barely got on base for a single bagger with the 3rd season.
@aerskine72 @Timcast @brianstelter I wouldn't be a bit surprised if Ramos himself blames Trump!
@Rocker2 @DailyCaller I think it was better than season 2, but still disappointed. And I do n't know why, but I hate to admit it, but Stephen Dorff was pretty good, as well as the rest of the cast. It didn't suck because of good performances, but like I said...Pizzolato missed again with the story.
@DailyCaller Strong finale? It was about as anti-climactic as it gets! Whole season was a jumbled mess trying to tie in 4 different periods of their lives. Pizzolato hit a HR on 1st...2nd and 3rd seasons were poor stories saved by good acting and a well crafted product, story sucked.
@ShyMarcus That woulld be twice in 3 weeks, I think.
@greta How about people who use a service pay for it! They agreed to it, they pay for it! What the hell is wrong with a society that thinks they shouldn't have to pay for a product they used because it's a burden?
@HogsHaven Interesting, DL 3 season in a row?
@JessicaChasmar @WashTimes I just wonder what her immigration status is, and if that should be revoked. No, this was not a terribly violent offense, but she clearly broke the law. If she is not a citizen, but holding a visa off some sort...send her back to Brazil!
@ann_boger @Reuters @AOC Meanwhile, Maduro is killing people in socialist Venezuela for trying to cross the border to get relief supplies. Cross border for food and get killed, or stay in country and starve? Helluva decision to make.
@mattklewis Why? His support of a now murderous dictator in Venezuela is enough for people to see how out of touch he is. Maduro is killing people trying to get relief supplies across the border with Brazil.
@czabe But we're talking about one of the most influential owners, not Paul Richardson.
@diannaESPN So refreshing on twitter is how you get your stories? I thought calling sources was the way to get info on a breaking story.
@czabe In all seriousness, you believe this will cause the NFL owners to try to oust him?
@ReneeCarrollAZ @626Robyn @w_terrence Trump should come to you!
@JesseKellyDC Well...the closest thing we have in today's world from that era is Clint Eastwood, and he is doing just that!
@arielhelwani Ngannou was assuredly going to win that fight, but if you or anyone else watching could not see that Cain gave up, that Ngannou did not knock him out, then you're just fooling yourselves. And I don't even like Velasquez, think he's one of the most over rated HW's of all time.
@HogsHaven No! That injury can be a career killer! NO THANKS!!! Haven't we as Redskins' fans learned our lesson about injured "steals"?
@yashar TRUER WORDS HAVE NEVER BEEN SPOKEN!!!!!
@NBCNews @NBCNewsTHINK How can anyone like the idea this headline quote says? The idea Humility, gratitude, and joy are "UN-AMERICAN" is about as true as Trump getting his tan in Palm Beach! Those traits are as American as they are Japanese, Chinese, Scandinavian, Indian, or any culture in the world!!!
@yashar Ha! It has more to do with the bitterness from that family that Obama's legacy will forever be tied to the Trump presidency! Barry and Michelle are angry because Trump got elected, showing how horrible Barry was as President, and the girls see that anger.
@MatthewBetley "But...but...but...we should just make more laws that the criminals will not follow!"		****Sarcasm alert****
@RealJamesWoods Lived in the Palm Beach from 1996-2007 w an even mix R&amp;D , mostly D in the south and R in the north. I watched county shift dramatically to the left with the influx of New Yorkers. I can only imagine about past 12 years looking at twitter and FB feeds from friends down there?
@kevinsheehanDC Yeah, you could tell he wanted to talk more about the divine presence at that race last night.
@JesseKellyDC Come on man, we've been through this...then the dude takes down a much more agile predator with his bare hands. #chokethemout
@oathofbrutus @JedWild21 @thecjpearson You have something to back this up other than she said so?
@JesseKellyDC I call hoax!
@GregOlmen @PDC1010 @SkinsRealm Dump all the contracts of anyone over 28 who won't significantly make this team better, or too poor. Draft/acquire a lot of youth on the cheap...let them play it out to see who can play. If we lose? Oh well! Draft the QB from next year's crop...no QB 1st round worthy this year.
@NRO @jackrcrowe FFS man! Obama set that precedent with his pen and phone!!!
@czabe But they cannot put together a better pension plan for the older players?
@dbongino When I first saw the story, I thought he had a plea agreement in place, and was sharing to get those involved in the creation of the story indicted.
@DailyCaller If he's good enough.
@JudyWoodruff @mrs_lerner @NewsHour No one is telling her she needs to be armed, not all teachers would be armed! They'd only arm teachers who have trained and only a handful! It's not about every teacher being armed! Nice projection!
@politico No she can't...she's never going to win the nomination, people are laughing at her!
@Snide_Remarks I am not challenging you, so relax and quit being an ass by suggesting I "keep up"...I am earnestly asking a question to which I do not know the answer. When did MD stop discussing the stadium with Snyder? Last I heard, Hogan was trying to keep the stadium in MD. What changed?
@Snide_Remarks What do you mean Maryland back in stadium talks? Less than 6 months ago, Hogan placed measures into effect that would help keep the stadium in PG County, preferably Oxon Hill Farms across from the National Harbour. What are you talking about, stadium talks?
@politico But the dude is dumb as a brick, and childish. "But...but...but...Mr. Chariman, He won't answer my hypothetical question meant to do nothing by try to embarrass him!"
@DrewSutton20 @seungminkim Actually, a trophy hunter would have the entire cat stuffed and mounted...just the heads of animals with racks or horns, usually.
@Richard70533990 @JoeyvondoomJoe @RyanAFournier I will always give him credit for serving this nation, as I would almost anyone else who put on the boots of an armed service in the US, but his time in Washington was not admirable.
@ConservativePTZ @RyanAFournier I would have 5...2 working the field with my livestock to keep them safe, 3 in the house.
@HogsHaven I sure hope the Redskins do not go after this kid!
@JerylBier @allahpundit Or it could be that the Democrats are positing such a horrible group of candidates to oppose him, they cannot justify voting for any of them.
@vtaltos @JonahNRO Are you really not smart enough to understand this? Hilary wins, she'd get 2 nominations...left activist judges would have a majority. Therefore, a lawsuit would be introduced in the 9th Circuit, and it would works it's way up to the SCOTUS, they'd have the votes to overturn!
@vtaltos @JonahNRO Don't know you to oppose that statement, but I am a realist...there are bitter pills to swallow in life, Trump was a bitter a pill. But I'd do it in a heartbeat to stop the liberal cause that was drastically close to destroying this nation if Trump's not elected.
@vtaltos @JonahNRO That's just it...it would not have been one term, but a continuation. She would've perpetuated the destruction of the previous 10 years! Not to mention, the SCOTUS would be dramatically different than today, more activists Judges like Sotomator and Kagan. 2nd Amendment gone!
@vtaltos @JonahNRO If Hilary had been the President, this country would have gone down...what about that can you not understand. Reputations can recover, the country would never have recovered from the damage she would have expounded upon that Obama did.
@JonahNRO I would do it, but I would also say that I am very glad that he is the President over Hilary Clinton, and of the entire Democratic possibilities, he is better. Gorsuch and Kavanaugh alone were worth it!
@JoeyvondoomJoe @RyanAFournier Do is a little research.,..he was a bully to his staff, he was a bully to the media, he tried to bully many of his colleagues even fight one, there are witnesses present when the man called his wife a c**t in public. Not to mention petty as shit for voting to keep ACA.
@Mr2020LA @Melissa31920880 Been trying to get this point across to all my friends who continue to bash her for her stupidity.
@RyanAFournier Meh...apple doesn't fall too far from the tree. I mean...her father did call his own wife a c**t!
@Brian_Riedl Not to mention the drain on the world's supply of resources to provide the materials for every single building in the country to be brought to their federal codes!
@kushibo @PaulMuaddib15 @ChrisRBarron @DonaldJTrumpJr Do you have a hard time with reading comprehension?
@lucinda_8669 @SenGillibrand @staceyabrams Your reading comprehension skills are lacking. It's not intentional...you simply are obtuse.
@lucinda_8669 @SenGillibrand @staceyabrams Does it matter? IT'S VOTER FRAUD! Abrams wants to suggest she was a victim, but doesn't mention Texas fraud. She's manufacturing herself a victim, but will not acknowledge cases with more evidence than her made up assertions of fraud. Are you intentionally obtuse or just dense?
@Harry1T6 Harry, have you not learned that what they say doesn't matter? It's all about the false narrative, the more exposure the better. Why do you think Abrams got the rebuttal to Trump? She has no viable message kinda foolish, but they want her exposure to try to get Perdue's seat.
@lucinda_8669 @SenGillibrand @staceyabrams And? It's voter fraud! Yet when Abrams &amp; Gillibrand talk about voter fraud, the inference is Abrams was the victim of it, when the final results have proven this to be untrue. Meanwhile in Texas, there appears to be huge accounts of voter fraud, but they remain silent about it.
@derbybbb @KatTimpf Alcohol has been studied more thoroughly that marijuana, more widely abused, more widely destructive. Are you suggesting we go back to prohibition?
@SenGillibrand @staceyabrams Yes! We agree! You should go down to Texas and speak out about the possible 90k illegal immigrants voting!

@JonahNRO Or Kim would have gotten so brazen, he'd have attempted to cross the 38th?

@SkinsRealm He'd be better than Lavaou, but I still think there are better than him for the position.
@wgdaquila @karlfischer_biz @KTHopkins The fact that you equate an ethnic Italian community service to a Muslim one shows your ignorance. I think the Shomrin can be a problem, too...there are stories of harassment from this organization toward homosexuals in their community, but again...you've missed the point.
@wgdaquila @karlfischer_biz @KTHopkins Your neighborhood does not have the exact same thing...there is a huge difference between ethnic Italians, and Muslims.
@MtCowboyWy I thought I was the only one who thought the same.
@kevinsheehanDC It wasn't boring, 2 genius defensive minds battled it out. The penalty was the phantom hold call on Sullivan after Gurley had churned off a 12 yard run to put them into Pats territory. Instead of 1st and 10 at their 48. It wads 1st and 20 	from their own 33.

@mar1f70 @KTHopkins There is a story here if they are policing free communities in the USA according to Sharia Law! What standard are they using, the laws of the city and state of NY, and the US Constitution, or a radical view of sharia like we see in ghettos in London and Paris?
@karlfischer_biz @KTHopkins Under what law? In the USA the Constitution is the Law of the Land. Are they policing under the Constitution of the US and NY State laws, or are they policing according to Sharia Law?
@maxkellerman No...Antonio Gates is. It's not Gates' fault he plays on a team that doesn't have Tom Brady throwing to him.
@Mr_Henson51 @SimoneBett Talking about the phantom hold on Sullivan that negated a great run by Gurley?
@granthpaulsen NONSENSE! Bruno Mars was applauded by everyone! As he should have been. Bruce Springsteen got one of the best reviews ever,deservedly, and I don't like him. Prince did a great job in the rain! People don't want to see theatrics, they want to see musicians!
@_JakeRussell Not if you don't mind watching 2 defensive geniuses battle it out.
@AlbertBreer I bet that the final score is over 48!
@AlbertBreer The tackle was a hard hit around the knees.
@KirkCousins8 They're setting something up!
@PoliticalShort I thank God for time I spent on my Uncle's farm. From ages 10-15 many a summer was spent on his farm, learning values like caring for something other than myself, the importance of community, and the stern love of a chiseled man who worked hard, and expected the same of me.
@theverdict777 @ambinc1 @NikkiHaley Oh I have far better to embarrass her later in life.
@andreaRschmidt @gotham01 @BuckSexton But we don't want him out of office, the Lt Gov would become a rock star!
@Realrclark25 Yeah, that Bears defense will always be in the discussion, but they had something more than a solid run game on offense to compliment it. All Baltimore had was Jamal Lewis on offense w/Dilfer not making mistakes. Sorry Trent, but you weren't winning Super Bowls w/out that D.
@drawandstrike Meanwhile, Vermont is going all in on infanticide! 		https://t.co/Jq7ejHK05p
@secupp @yashar Yup! I think dude should enjoy his 15 minutes, but for anyone in public life to link themselves to someone who defrauded thousands, and was willing to prostitute himself for the cause...probably isn't a great idea.
@BuckSexton Let it perpetuate! He is refusing to step down, holding true his stance, and status as Governor...let this be the cycle for a little while. The Dems threw him under the bus trying to get focus off his stance on abortion, thinking he'd go away quietly. Well...now what do they do?
@Shaktus_ Read the law...viable fetus is not part of the wording, nor is life-threatening. It states a threat to the woman's health. And it is vague at that. So what determines a threat to her health? Mental health? A stubbed toe? Instead of being an asshole, get yer facts straight.
@BoloBoffin @KatrinaPierson Because there were more democrats.
@ChrisLoesch Meanwhile, the DNC has been playing identity politics for generations. the absolute hubris of these people!
@JayRogers24 @CoryBooker Haha! Stop! If you understood politics as you claim, you'd know why Garland never got his day in the Senate. The people of the US decided that one! They voted for Gorsuch, Kavanaugh, and RGB's replacement!
@JayRogers24 @CoryBooker Good thing the witch hunt was seen for what it was, a sham! And now, Trump is one justice away from overturning Roe v, Wade. They better hope no one finds out how grave RBG's health is!

@JayRogers24 @CoryBooker Haha! You're analogy is flawed. But nice try!
@CoryBooker I don't know, you were pretty hateful towards Kavanaugh with unprovable accusations levied against him.

@redskinstoday_ #FireBruceAllen
@AriFleischer Does she realizes there were 37 more Democrats who voted AGAINST the Civil Rights act in the House than GOP 61 Dems to 24 GOP, and in the Senate there were only 3 GOP while 20 Dems voted AGAINST it. There were far more Democrats AGAINST Civil Rights act than GOP...but OK.

@JulieBanderas I care what you think.
@Sad_and_ashamed @NikkiHaley Laws written previously say abortions performed this late must be a risk to the mother's "life". NY Law says "health". See what they did there? What determines health? Mental health? Stubbed toe? What's standard with new wording? It's a slippery slope to legal abortion full term.
@chandio @NikkiHaley This was her birth not destruction, she is a happy, healthy child.
@pablo_honey1 @NikkiHaley Bwahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha! I would like the last 5 minutes of my life back, please!
@pablo_honey1 @NikkiHaley Again, your point is disingenuous! What on earth gives you the idea she is more or less, concerned about life after birth, than the child in the womb. It's not either or proposition. In my experience, those who love the life in the womb, are more likely to love life after birth.
@mathesonallie @NikkiHaley Just to be clear, she is a healthy and happy young girl.
@pablo_honey1 @NikkiHaley Is this some sort of new attack against Pro-Lifers? Well, you must care about the unborn so much, you don't care about the born. So, if you hate the unborn enough to kill them, what do you think of the born?

None of it shows anything remotely close to collusion. Those "associated" with Trump have been charged w crimes not related and years before.

@lisamurkowski Once again, private sector saving people where the government failed. And there is confusion about people who don't trust AOC and the others championing government control of everything!?!?!?
@JesseKellyDC You should fly him in to do it for you.
@AdamSchefter Gregg Williams should have held out for that job!
@KirstenPowers @joshtpm It's not about your opinion any longer, it's about your inability to see what's in front of you. O'Reilly treated you poorly, but he kept you grounded. The people around you at CNN seem to be creating an echo chamber that has caused you to lose all objectivity.
@DailyCaller They're gonna make the mistake in Philly to put their eggs in the Carson Wentz basket, when Nick Foles is the better QB.
@redskinstoday_ @DeAngeloHall23 Why? Is he a good coach? You know this how? Because he has experience coaching?
@BigEdMcCarthy @czabe Because he would have been beaten without the QB protection rules now in place. You ever watch games from the 70's and 80's?
@kylegriffin1 @LeslieMarshall But they still traffic drugs, and people in the unsecure areas along the border!
@ProFootballTalk He would have gotten his chance if the Chiefs defense had done their job!!!!
@JesseKellyDC Stop beating up your kid! And yes...give them credit. Now hope the Rams blow them away by 35 points!
@stephenasmith @tonyromo OK, stop! He knows football, but is he a leader? His team mates never looked at him like a leader, what makes you think players will look at him as a leader when coaching? Now, if you want to say he could be a great OC...meh, maybe.
@john_keim What makes it any different than sudden death? Defense has to stop...they didn't. Are you saying defense is meaningless in the NFL?
@czabe Look, not trying to minimize...well, yes! Yes I am trying to minimize his accomplishments. If he played when Terry Bradshaw, Roger Staubach, or even Joe Montana did, his career would never have lasted this long. Yes, he should be discussed in GOAT terms, but with an asterisk!
@AdamSchefter @guypbenson They also missed the obvious facemaSk on Jared Goff the previous series that would have given the Rams 2ND and goal from the half yard line.
@adamhousley They blew a 10 point lead late in the game.
@SuzanneElizabe Such a positive day was spun to steer attention away from the anti-semite march the following day.
@AsheSchow It's a buildup of the Amy Barrett nomination battle in the Senate. Kamala Harris has been beating the drum loudly against the Knights of Columbus for this same reason.
@matteorenn @TheNotoriousMMA What will Dana King...er...umm...I mean Don White...er...umm...Dana White do?	#danawhiteisthenewdonking
@ryenarussillo Which is why you should never discount the Pats. Playing away from Gillette stadium may be an issue, Arrowhead is one of the most difficult venues for opposing teams, but Belichek is a master of single game, game plans...especially big games like this. Same said of Andy Reid?
@DeansherryS @MSNBC @NBCNews @gabegutierrez Wait! What? 1st time I've seen NBC ask border patrol about crisis. They confirmed crisis, but at the end of the piece Gabe questioned the people on the front line about their 1st hand account that it is a crisis!
@DailyCaller Did he find the Fake Trump Porn? https://t.co/y50doycs3H
@RedWhite_Gooner @TheNotoriousMMA Well...looks like they follow along with my suggestion if Cowboy Cerrone is actually given the fight against Conor. Conor said he'd fight Cowboy after tonight's fight. It might be that Dana told Conor he needs to fight someone before getting into the Championship fight talk.
@ryenarussillo Did you ever watch the Detroit Pistons of the late 80's/early 90's? Outrage about this play is why I don't watch the NBA anymore.
@RedskinNation1 @opie124 @darrellgreen28 #FireBruceAllen
@MSNBC Making sure Nancy does not get her way.
@CNN Well, had she not tried to enter this nation without the proper procedure, they would not have been separated. This "tragedy" lies solely at the feet of this mother!
@iowahawkblog It's becoming one of the better investments to make these days.

@RedWhite_Gooner @TheNotoriousMMA He shouldn't even get a shot at one of them...they should make him fight Edson Barbosa, then a #2 or #3 ranked opponent, then a championship fight. But...Dana wants to make as much as possible before Connor is exposed for all to see. #danawhiteisthenewdonking
@dcarli24 @AhmadElAgami @QxlvSnD @TheNotoriousMMA I really thought I was the only one who saw his rise to fame this way.
@BuzzFeedNews If she didn't go, she wasn't in danger. The whole idea was to make sure she didn't go, so since she never even left US air space, she was not in danger. Nice try!
@yashar Right...who said Mueller leaked? Ingraham didn't. Here's exactly what she said, "Telling that Mueller team is leaking. Strange at this point. If they had  Trump “collusion” to rig the election , they wdnt need to leak.  It’d  be in the final report."
@arielhelwani The WWE face off!
@benshapiro He can still say she was going, and in his letter he stated it was not wise to go in light of the shutdown.
@SenSchumer @realDonaldTrump @JudiciaryDems It does not matter who Trump nominates, you won't vote for them. You know it, we know it. You're an obstructionist!
@Redskins This is part of the problem with this team! We love Jamison, we'd love to keep Jamison, but the last 2 season he has missed too much time! Don't bring back oft injured players hoping they can stay healthy! Go get healthy players!!! FFS!!!!! #FireBruceAllen
@JessicaTarlov Well Ms. Tarlov, do you think it would be off base to say the Obamas aren't there for all Americans with their never ending attacks on the GOP?
@team980 @Capitals @Laughlin18 @NBCSWashington @AlGaldi They're playing a tough schedule...nothing wrong, they can't win them all. No need to drum up drama that isn't there.
@benshapiro Why would he ever give up such a huge platform for free air time?
@JesseKellyDC Just look at Cleveland for the answer. Use before the Rock n Roll Hall of Fame and after to get a glimpse.
@adriandgarcia Not if they're bombarding us with marketing materials the moment we open the link. That would be more akin to the free news we get from local TV programming.
@SethAMandel Why on earth would Donald Trump, a master marketer, turn down the amount of free press he will get from that platform? That's like asking the sun to rise in the west tomorrow!
@JonahNRO Holy crap! Someone has a man crush on Jonah!
@john_keim I would have walked. I wouldn't be a bit surprised to see Williams as the head coach by the end of the week...if he is hired at all.
@granthpaulsen So what!?!?! He has Drew Brees, a HoF QB, throing to him and he plays in a culture of winning. Had Thomas come to DC...what? He's gonna be much better than 45 catches?
@redskinstoday_ I bet the results wouldn't be much different. There's a culture of winning with a HoF QB down there throwing him the ball. What do we have here in DC?
@bigblue2388 @maxkellerman I ain't skeer'd. Mahomes takes advantage as Andy Reid QB, just like Smith, McNabb, and Vick. He's a damn good QB, but he is not the greatest ever like Max is suggesting. Reid has put him in position to put up ridiculous numbers. I made a mistake on numbers, but argument is legit.
@Realrclark25 @stephenasmith Where is he?
@JayGlazer Far different. I wish the Redskins had fired Gruden after the debacle to end their season against the Giants 2 years ago and given the reigns to McVay! Alas, my Redskins suck and this kid wins.
@czabe You mean like to get ready for that TD?
@SethAMandel Ha! Too bad the Saints and the Chiefs both have equally good offenses.
@Demcremewoods @kilts77 @maxkellerman No he's not! He's a good coach, but not a brilliant offensive mind like Reid.
@merlisa @kilts77 @maxkellerman Because RG3 had such a great season in a gimmick offense.
@RedskinsRD21 @SimoneBett I was talking about specifically the 2 who were mentioned, Haskins and Murray...easy their killer.
@SimoneBett I WON"T! It will make me even more pissed because they didn't learn their lesson with RG3. These guys are not NFL QB's.
@KurtSchlichter Yes! Furley was Barney Fyfe trying to be a slick pimp in the 70's.
@allahpundit Thank Obama for it! Trump is President because more people in the middle did not want 4 more years of Obama's failed policy with Hilary as the President. Those people in the middle are supposed to be the measured ones.
@MSNBC @JoyAnnReid She's not Jenelle, they're all for bigger government!
@andypollin1 Well...there you go! TD Gurley! McVay is brilliant, he's getting a lot of carries to CJ so Gurley doesn't get tired out...in the 4th Q that will be so important.
@kilts77 @maxkellerman Well, that was kinda my point. I don't think Alex Smith is better than Luck, but for Max to make such a call about Mahomes after 1 season in Andy Reid's offense is just foolish. Luck's rookie season was special, like this season for Mahomes without a brilliant offensive coach.
@UnfilteredSE @secupp @MariaTCardona @KevinMaddenDC I keep hearing the majority of Americans oppose the wall, but I rarely see the hard data on this...just polls that ask questions steered for the outcome that supports your ideas.
@EdLatimore @_willcompton I just had that happen 15 minutes ago. I decided it wasn't even worth trying to explain it...no need to correct them. Others already started...he can't see his mistake.
@JoeTrippi They found the needle in the haystack!
@allahpundit Problem is this is Phillip Rivers year!
@maxkellerman Would love to see an Andy Reid coached Andrew Luck before I'd make that staement. Alex Smith had almost the same numbers last year in KC last year as Mahomes this year. Is Smith better than Luck?
@Realrclark25 From what I saw in videos out there, it was Chiefs' fans throwing the snowballs.
@_JakeRussell Don't worry, I won't. Haha! I have Dallas winning tonight. Mind you...I'm a Redskins' fan and am cheering for McVay!
@_JakeRussell Well...not so good so far.
@Pseudo_RGIII I would prefer they go about doing things the way the Cowturds have...build both lines, a strong defense, get a top rated RB, a good enough QB, and sign a super star WR. Going into the game tonight, Dallass has a good shot of making it to the NFC Championship w old school recipe.
@Codliano @LakeLewis No Brees, we end up with Nick Foles for 90 million guaranteed over 3 years.
@BGObsession @LakeLewis Problem is, Synder's head is so far up his ass, he obviously doesn't see the walls of his empire crumbling...he'll just make a big move. Nick Foles gets 90 million guaranteed over 3 years.
@LakeLewis Well, I think we can all expect some splash this off-season. If Snyder cannot see how bad it is now, he'll simply revert to the same old tired tactics he's used in the past. Don't be surprised if we break the bank for Nick Foles.
@opie124 @LakeLewis At that point with my 6 year old son, who started showing interest this year. Now? I am not interested, so what's next? #firebruceallen
@Ky3fOUR Tell him to stop dancing after a good play when his team is losing.
@SenBooker @CoryBooker Quit calling it the Trump shut down and admit it's the Trump/Pelosi pissing match.
@SenFeinstein Sooner or later you will realize we see through this bs! It's not him, it's not you...it's BOTH of you!
@greta That's the problem, Greta. The Obama administration perfected the art of directing a narrative. Send out some tweet or leak info to AM shows, let them mention it, same at noon, same mid-day, then by the 5 and 6pm cycles, it's got enough leverage for "source" material. #gospel
@chaddukes But how did they hide from the #firebruceallen campaign? I think https://t.co/PGdhbfUesP stopped posting because their feed was flooded with that #. It's time to start calling their offices. Call 301-276-6800 Email washingtonredskinsfans@redskins.com. Don't go to games!
@HogsHaven I just called and left a v/m at this # - 301-276-6800 Here is the email address - washingtonredskinsfans@redskins.com It's obvious he did not hear the #FireBruceAllen campaign. Let's make our voices louder by using methods he will hear...and stop attending games.
@HogsHaven I just hope that everyone saying they won't watch, or attend games until there is change stands up to that commitment after the off-season market splash they'll attempt to get everyone back on board.
@TwoPennyBeer @BGObsession Nope, just your average run of the mill, status quo decision to give the biggest problem in your front office more unfettered control of the team.
@Mo_httr4life @kevinsheehanDC I am with you. Before the first playoff game, as coaches were fired that if Gruden and Allen were both here, I'd not watch or attend another game. I have children that have been neglected on Sundays...for this?
@JonahNRO No! While Bailey is awesome...Jennifer &gt;
@Acosta Dear Diary, today I saw an attention whore get owned by the interwebz.
@JonahNRO The next Dem President will do it anyway.
@Orioles I will skip, once again in the off-season Angelos refuses to allow the front office to make the team better.
@NBCNews They grew to with the likes of Walter Cronkite, so they could trust sources like NBC...now? You guys are one of the biggest perpetrators of fake news, so they're just spreading your BS!
@NikkiHaley Is it Republicans?
@KirstenPowers Nope...not enough that she is now the leader of the network...it should have been done sooner! FFS, are you just miserable...or are you making these claims for reaction?
@ByMikeJones OK, I am not going to repeat what dude did regarding race and coaching, but Raheem Morris? If you cannot see he's been a failure as a head coach, and not very successful as a DC or positions coach, you shouldn't be making a living as a sports pundit.
@FrankieEdgar Frankie, you're one of my favorite fighters in the UFC. What you did in the WW division was outstanding! But if the past 5 years at FW haven't taught you the UFC will not give you another title fight, especially after the loss to Ortega, you're fooling yourself. #bellator
@MSNBC @NBCNewsTHINK I'd like to ask the professor about the numerous castles throughout the world built to protect the citizens of the region. She gives examples of less than a handful built by tyrants, but neglects the innumerable walls throughout mankind that have helped protect the populace.
@JackPosobiec Haha! Where did Hitler build a wall?
@LarrySabato Well, I didn't vote for him, but I agree w/ Obama, Schumer, and the overwhelming majority of Democrats just a few years ago who suggested a physical barrier was necessary to protect this country from the crime and violence along the Mexican border.
@jbarro Just a quick question for those of you who say a physical barrier doesn't work. If it doesn't, why are there thousands of immigrants camped out in Tijuana and not in parks in cities like San Diego, and Los Angeles?
@RealMikeWilbon I wish George Michael was still alive so he could tell you shut the **** up! What a stupid statement.
@czabe So I should be happy you're not following me?
@stephenasmith @Eagles Foles deserves as much credit as that defense, both have stepped up their game since they got robbed in Dallass. They played on fire yesterday to beat a team that was better than them overall.
@johnnyringo7777 @JesseKellyDC OK, but my dog has been successfully bred to kill wolves in the wild to protect their flock...not some average dog. Not saying this in some vacuum, he's as big as average wolf . Been handling large breed dogs all my life. I think I can handle a lone wolf.
@BrianPlant11 @triSTsoldier @JesseKellyDC Yeah, like I said they are more deterrents. Again, you're not reading the material I am providing or you wouldn't be asking me these questions. Do a little research. Please read this... https://t.co/Eak9R5yfDP
@Brian_Tinsman @_JakeRussell He's not a good coach...he is too impatient.
@BrianPlant11 @JesseKellyDC And to add to that, my dog in particular is on the large end of the spectrum in size of this breed. Males tend to be 120-140, mine is just under 2 years old and he is almost 150...148 last we checked a few months ago. He hasn't even fully filled out yet.
@BrianPlant11 @triSTsoldier @JesseKellyDC Turkey had strict breeding standards on this breed since it's their national dog. The breeder I got mine from, her mother played a big role bringing the breed to the US in the 70's. They had been introduced, but not on a large scale. They're still not bred on a large scale here.
@BrianPlant11 @triSTsoldier @JesseKellyDC Because ranchers are not killing them. In Africa, this breed is used by the Cheetah Conservation to do the same. There is almost a 100% success rate for farmers who now have these dogs in with their livestock.	https://t.co/1XmG7q70RI
@BrianPlant11 @JesseKellyDC It was not the intent to say my dog in particular did, the breed does. I have a breed of dog known to kill wolves.
@triSTsoldier @BrianPlant11 @JesseKellyDC You don't have to believe me, but it has been documented that this breed kills wolves. And mine is 2 years old and is just starting to fill out. He's a big one at 148 pounds.
@triSTsoldier @BrianPlant11 @JesseKellyDC https://t.co/SEiU4ZbYkD
@WmWallace1911 @ryano3232_ryan @mchooyah @JesseKellyDC It's the perspective, the wolf is in the foreground, makes him look bigger. The wold if about 150-160 pounds. I'm 285 and have opposable digits...I'd take it!
@emzanotti Actually, it did for thousands of years. Was it perfect? No, but it kept wildings at bay for thousands of years. It wasn't til the dragon destroyed it that it didn't work any longer. Are there dragons in Mexico?
@triSTsoldier @BrianPlant11 @JesseKellyDC The breed has been killing wolves for 6 thousand years. Anatolian Shepherd...look it up.
@ronsingh23 @maxkellerman @ChicagoBears @Eagles Well, I got that one wrong, huh?
@RealSaavedra You're not?
@czabe Kiper still thinks Jimmy Claussen should be starting in the NFL. Lamar Jackson is not a QB. He is a RB/WR playing behind center.
@czabe The immediate future, but he'll be a backup or out of the league altogether by 2021.
@czabe Steve, these guys don't understand. Remember when Gibbs went with Doug Williams?
@maxkellerman @ChicagoBears @Eagles No chance! That Bears team is the hottest team going into the playoffs in the NFC. They win by at least 20 points.
@McShay13 Joe Flacco can get it done, he's magical!
@BrianPlant11 @triSTsoldier @JesseKellyDC Kudos Brian! It's rare I see civil discourse. Kudos to you.
@McShay13 Flacco! It's not a long term problem, the kid is young...Flacco has done it too many times. Everyone knows he's gone to end the season.
@triSTsoldier @BrianPlant11 @JesseKellyDC Nah...they only have one weapon. I have handled big dogs my whole life, my current dog is a wolf killer. I know I could take one.
@JayGlazer I thought Rivers was the best of the 3 then, I think he's the best of the 3 now. He was simply dealt a bad hand in San Diego. The other 2 had the pleasure of great teams around them with consistency. SD should have stuck w Marty...Smith screwed Rivers.
@JesseKellyDC I have a dog as big as a wolf, I think I could take a single wolf down too. How about a cougar? They're usually about the same size.
@RealSaavedra @dbongino And Ryan, they keep bringing up the Berlin Wall, but as long as it stood, it worked! It was completely functional!
@MSNBC That soundsed like a great description of Barak Obama. Think about it...Obama was so bad, Trump was elected!
@MSNBC @allinwithchris And Obama had his minions go out and suggest the attacks on Benghazi were in response to a video, which they have never walked back. Which was more egregious?
@gregmlaw @Bakari_Sellers Meh...he exposed Clinton's perjury. Can't help it if the DoJ won't pursue charges.
@DhaSickest Here's the thing...you're correct, we don't know your ability to recover. But, we once had a dynamic young QB come to DC dependent greatly upon his physical abilities, who tore his ACL and became just a below average player after. So, you might understand our concerns, no?
@Cap_Institute And she'll stand by the walls and claim, "These walls are keeping us out of our homeland." Yet suggest a wall on our southern border is a waste of money, it won't work.
@DailyCaller Why? Is he running out of money, trying to get paid for being in the ring with Floyd?
@SenatorRomney @MittRomney And while she was a bit over the line, if you'd gotten your hands half as dirty against Obama , you might have stood a better chance in 2012.
@carl5480 @JOANNAc10983 Haha! Nice try buddy, but the fact that she could not follow the conversation, inserting Trump when discussing term limits in Congress, and your inability to see her mistake...makes you both, stupid!
@GeraldoRivera @RashidaTlaib @realDonaldTrump Well...nothing getting done might just be a good thing on all sides. Anything that really needs done, unravelling Obama's mess, can be done with a pen and a phone.
@carl5480 @JOANNAc10983 You as dumb as she is? She mentioned Trump, when the discussion is about term limits, and Congress.
@JOANNAc10983 @Bear6448Wyman @deeg25 @tedcruz @SpeakerPelosi @RepMaxineWaters @realDonaldTrump Do you understand the topic? TERM LIMITS! PRESIDENTS HAVE TERM LIMITS!!! term limits. You aren't too smart, are you?
@TBeitscher @deeg25 @tedcruz Yes
@baltimoresun I love the love for Kansas City, but...ANDY REID!!!!
@LeslieMarshall What did you say about maturity? https://t.co/gQ2PMiWXah
@deeg25 @tedcruz This is great theatre, and I like that Cruz actually brings to light the need for term limits in Congress so the Nancy Pelosis, and the Maxine Waters of the world cannot gain a fortune for life off the back of their constituents.
@Snide_Remarks Count me in as the I'm done if the name changes.
@ByronYork @GreenvilleNews The problem is, we need more like him.
@IlhanMN What is the Law of the Land in the United States, Sharia or US Constitution?
@edhenry When you interview a Democrat who says the tax cuts didn't work, ask them why there were record revenues to the Federal Government after the tax cuts took place !
@LizMair She already lost...the moment she submitted the DNA test. She is a laughing stock.
@ryenarussillo Well...as a sports' journalist isn't that what you're supposed to do?
@thedailybeast What about a story on the families shattered by Taliban rule?
@RambusDesigns @CraigHoffman Right, then Jerruh built his palace and became #1, Snyder is stuck with the shit hole in Landover. Look, I hate defending Snyder, but financially, the Skins are a success. Unfortunately, the asshat does not know how to build a winner on the field.
@ChristiAnnHay @KassyDillon ChristiAnn, that is very similar to us...10-3, 8-11, 8-12. After 41 hours, and 10 pound baby c-section for our first, my wife looked at me when they were putting her back together and said, "If we do this again, just have'em cut it out of me."
@ChristiAnnHay @KassyDillon And Kassy, prayers to your niece! While exhausted, I'm sure both momma and baby girl will be fine.
@ChristiAnnHay @KassyDillon OK, my wife went through 41 hours of labor to deliver a 10 pound 3 ounce baby boy!
@hughhewitt @OhioStateFB @ClemsonFB This is the same argument everyone made when it was just #1 and #2 playing for the National Title! Shoulda, woulda, coulda! If they just break down and have an 8 playoff system, there will be less shouldas. 4 Q finals, semis, and a final. Make the Champion earn it.
@big_chippa @CraigHoffman Look, I loathe Dan Snyder...hate what he has done to the franchise, but the idea that the business of the Redskins to make money has been hurt is foolish, and the Post is stupid to suggest as much. They are worth 3.2 billion! Only 4 NFL teams are worth more.
@jonallen93_ Young man, thank you for being the consummate professional while things were falling apart around you. Here's to hoping this ship can be righted before you're ready to leave.
@CraigHoffman The problem is, he hasn't tanked his business. he still owns the 5th most valuable franchise in the NFL. Will it be near there over the next 5 years? Who know, but in 20 years, he has made 2.4 billion as the owner of the team.
@_JakeRussell Well, considering how long it will take for DC, MD, and VA to come together to get the new stadium built in Oxon Hill across the National Harbour, it might just happen.
@dcsportsbog @_JakeRussell Look, I know we're a laughing stock, but other NFL execs talking smack? The Redskins have maintained a top rankings in value for ~40 years, spending much of that time as #1. Fans all over the NFL are talking about how poor their FO's are.
@KennedyNation Not me!
@AdamCarriker94 They played a good LSU tough for most of the game, without their super star QB.
@arielhelwani @HenryCejudo Worst decision ever! To be the champ, you gotta beat the champ. How those refs gave Cejudo that win is embarrassing! Don White = New Don King #danawhiteisthenewdonking
@rak98 @Titans @Redskins @TexasFootball Brian, as a Redskins' fan, I want to say thank you for the 6 years you gave here! They played you out of position for most of that time, but you still excelled! Thank you!
@BGObsession Read some of Mike Jones tweets today?
@BurgundyNGold84 @czabe Far different coaching a team away from your family, than being a figure head to run a race car business. He doesn't have to invest as much energy in racing isn't as hands on and his grandchild lives near him in NC where he runs the race team. Nice try, but totally different.
@granthpaulsen So...by your logic Gruden would remain HC forever. There are an average of 6-7 HC job openings every year. You're terrible! How the hell you got a job doing what you do is beyond me!
@czabe And you're stretching it to say that reed, McCoy, and Richardson were "impact" players.
@czabe Yet nothing will change. Snyder is so out of touch with reality. I swear Miscavage must have some real dirt on him!
@SteveCowenMTG @Russellmania621 While I agree with your sentiment, the organization was never a Ferrari. Maybe a Cadillac Escalade, but that ended when Gibbs left. Dan has turned it into a 3 cylinder Yugo!
@ByMikeJones @USATODAY They saved their season with Foles starting instead of Wentz.
@DailyCaller Extremely shocking to whom?
@AlGaldi It's funny, just 4 years ago you posed the question w/ Cooley on the radio, "If you were Dan, what would you do?" I called and said fly to NW and hire Scot Mac. Here we are in the same boat, but I have no idea who they should hire to replace Bruce &amp; Jay, but fire them I would!!!
@skinshuly I am done investing my finances on the team. I gave it one more season overall, because I once considered myself a die-hard, but it's not worth it to me. Dan Snyder doesn't deserve our loyalty. The Redskins may, but not him. God bless you! I just can't do it anymore.
@skinshuly Don't you ever feel betrayed? You guys have done so much...ever wonder, why?
@czabe His grand child's health be damned!
@ryenarussillo Why? This is what we in Washington expected to see from him without a run game, and a unhealthy OL.
@czabe Joe Gibbs is being used as a tool, and is too nice/naive to know as much.
@czabe Yup...Snyder thinks he can sell us on the excitement of our former glory, again.
@HogsHaven Make that 53
@gchwood @Snide_Remarks Not in today's NFL. Come on man...those days are over!
@gchwood @Snide_Remarks Right, because the formula for success in the NFL is what you described, throw for 150 yards, 1 TD, make no mistakes, and depend on your defense.
@Tarik_ElBashir You took a picture of the opposing team sidelines.
@AdamCarriker94 We will never win a Super Bowl again, as long as Dan Snyder owns the team.
@gchwood @Snide_Remarks Did you watch him? We weren't 6-3 because of him. Our defense wore down, we were in games because of them.
@maxkellerman Yes, I looked up the rule...both feet or any part of the body except the hands.
@Snide_Remarks You're dreaming. Alex Smith was never going to get us 10 wins.
#firebruceallen #firebruceallen #firebruceallen #firebruceallen #firebruceallen #firebruceallen #firebruceallen #firebruceallen
@AveryGenard If there were an 8 team playoff...yes! But they had their chance but gave the game to Bama late.
@MSNBC That should say, "Thank Trump for a Record Setting Year!"
@JimMcFierceSon @SGT_Friedel @JMSDSTSTL @SenGillibrand @realDonaldTrump I don't care about "Mexico paying for it!" You idiots supported, "You can keep your doctors!" One question for the "walls don't work" crowd...if walls don't work, then why are there thousands of so called refugees in Tijuana and not San Diego and Los Angeles?
@PolitiC77975203 @SenGillibrand @realDonaldTrump Not nearly as much as you knowing that all 8 years of Obama could get is Donald Trump elected President.
@ChrisLoesch I can believe it. Now Holly Holmes need to dedicate the next 6 months to being the best she can possibly be, and take one last shot at Nunes. That is about the extent of the women's competition at these weight classes.
@NickSundberg Yet his teams win National Championships.
@SenGillibrand @realDonaldTrump Then vote to fund the wall!
@SenFeinstein You mean like the billions he has sent to help those in need in those countries?
@StanfordBrian @KassyDillon BLASPHEMY!
@KassyDillon You are simply mad! In N Out &gt; Whataburger!
@greta Great, are you doing a podcast?
@CBSNews @LeslieMarshall @BetoORourke Some? Both kids were killed by a rigorous trip...let's find out who is funding these caravans and hold them responsible and the parents of these kids, not border protection who only saw them when it was too late.
@HogsHaven I liked, then unliked this tweet 5 times because once was just not enough.
@TomiLahren And this surprises you?
@JesseKellyDC Not just rock n roll, but r&amp;b and even pop music!
@SenFeinstein Then find out who funded the caravan that brought them here! They should be held responsible for placing children at such a risk.
@ByMikeJones Yup...looks like a week suspension could have bought time for us to work out a trade when the season was over.
@GIrish3173 @TheJuanWilliams @thehill John MacLaughlin would be very upset with Juan.
@greta @MonicaLewinsky So you agree? Bill Clinton was a predator!
@ConservativePTZ Like my wife in my ear... https://t.co/cumxS9Hrex
@RepJoeKennedy Right, because they got their paycheck before the shutdown and won't be getting their paycheck til next week...so right now there is no effect on their pay...only if the shutdown continues until next Friday.
@FieldYates I was looking at their 10-5 record and first place standing...in the weakest division in football for 20 years running!
@MAGAindex One day the DNC will control the Senate and the house, again. God forbid, but it will happen. Can you imagine a nuclear option if they're in control with a Dem president?
@NateSilver538 @allahpundit Hilary isn't President, and 2 justices affirmed to the Supreme Court. It's a win already. Now if no legislation gets passed in the next 2 years, it's probably a good thing, just like it was a good thing Obama couldn't...until he started signing EO's that we're unconstitutional.
@JPFinlayNBCS Unfortunately, yes. And we'll continue to see uninspired play, terrible clock management, poor in game adjustments, a slew of injuries (yes I said injuries because he will bring bak the same injury prone players next year), overall poor leadership. Time to go, but he gets 1 more.
@kevinsheehanDC Wasn't ideal, but any points are good points when the game is turning into a field possession game.
@soledadobrien Because you're irrational. The kid was given a choice, comply with the rules set forth, or forfeit...it's a simple solution. He chose to have his hair cut, and won. Difficult decision, I'm sure, but rules are rules. Your solution of physical violence just shows you're irrational.
@greta Well...Trump donates his salary, so you should go to Congress and ask them.
@TulsiGabbard He doesn't want to go to war with Iran, just not strengthen them. There is no doubt this move is good for Iran, but it still needs to be done. We'll get Iran in other ways...one of which is to not give them 1.5 billion bucks in cash!
@secupp Are you afraid of losing your job at CNN if you don't post nonsense like this?
@realDonaldTrump NO! I want you to build the wall, but nuclear option is a short term gain in the long game. Allows progressive Dems to pass whatever they want in a Dem controlled Senate. It will come back to bite us...much like using nuclear option to pass judges backfired on the Dems.
@OliverMcGee @senatemajldr NO! It shouldn't even be considered! Imagine a DNC controlled Senate nuclear option voting on every bill they want passed.
@BTWCelticShow @HillaryClinton @CherylRofer Actually, as long as she remains in the spotlight...or in her current case, 4th lead...it is affirmation of the country's decision to elect Trump! Thanks Obama! Hahaha!
@thecjpearson CJ, they need 60 votes in the Senate. 51 GOP Senators at this time.
@RealFacelessMan @sweedypy @NotFamousAaron @matheweliason @AP Slippery slope...you can get away with it for nominees, but law? We don't want Dems going nuclear over issues they only need 51 votes to pass.
@rpetty Look, James is a good character, does much for the community, Andy simply being there for his son makes him a good father, but he was mic'ed up for this...this was concocted for the camera. Takes away from the sentiment.
@bethanyshondark So my wife should be shamed for not being capable of pumping?
@juliaioffe Merry Christmas!
@benshapiro Why pump shame? My wife was incapable of pumping.
@Aniruddhas45 @BlessedMMA Well, looks like you may be right if Moicano can get past Aldo. Looks like Magomedshapirov is going to be on the outside looking in on a championship fight until later next year. Unless Aldo beats Moicano, they just shouldn't give Aldo a 3rd shot at Max.
@NBCNews The narrative attempted by this story is complete BS!!! The US government is not killing journalists, the one killing inside US mentioned in the story had nothing to do with Trump, or anything Trump has ever said! I would call this disingenuous, but it's downright dishonest!!!
@BlessedMMA Is Magomedsharipov next after he destroys Jeremy Stephens?
@michaelmalice The NSA is grateful for FB...makes their jobs much easier! To top that off, Alexa in the homes of millions, people self-bugged? They must really love that!
@TIME Yeah, must have been real comfortable for her to be there, knowing that her husband's presidency was summed up by Trump becoming president. Thanks Obama!
@bpaintsonice @czabe I'm ok with 10 yards from where the play went dead, so if there is a sack, it's a ten yard penalty from there. Just not an auto first and 3rd and 24 and the QB gets sacked immediately.
@czabe Yes! Good rule! Now...can they do something about the bs defense hold calls that get called when they have absolutely NO effect on the play.
@Theismann7 Joe, please stop. Your relevance is diminishing, but you'll always be a Redskins' great. Just stop with nonsense like this and accept fate.
@brezinski_mike @politico And you know he does this, because...?
@politico Is he not allowed to watch Fox News?
@czabe Playoffs? WTF?!?!?! We can still win the division!!!
@walterolson @weeklystandard Stop...Kristol lost his appeal as a quality writer, and became a bitter hack. It was not the same magazine it was just 5 years ago.
@kevinsheehanDC The closest thing we've see to Sean Taylor since ST.
@john_keim @espn It doesn't weigh on him, because he doesn't care enough. He knows he'll end up with his brother whatever happens.
@kevinsheehanDC Also, there needs to be a stipulation stating the hold must have clearly affected the play. If the QB is sacked w/out any chance of seeing the receiver, much less throwing it to them, it should not be called. Like a pass that is clearly not catchable is not PI.
@JackPosobiec When they try? They are already trying...
@BoyGeniusLA @kevinsheehanDC I just don't know why anyone would suggest such nonsense. He is the same QB here in Baltimore, that he was in DC. He cannot feel the pressure, cannot see the field, and is slowed by injury. Oh...I know why, CLICK BAIT!
@bennyjohnson The whole twitterverse on the left has been suggesting that Chuck and Nancy were GREAT! I wondered what they were watching? They were both exposed, and Trump was brilliant to invite the media to the meeting so we can all see how corrupt those 2 are.
@SenGillibrand keep fighting! You're always fighting! Have you ever discussed compromise? Have you ever thought of working on anything bi-partisan? You partisan HACK!!
@SethAMandel Kasich is not a good candidate.
@BuckSexton They didn't want to hurt their chances of gaining seats in the house, and knew talking impeachment was not a winner. Now they've won the House...impeachment, impeachment, impeachment!!!
@KatiePavlich So let me get this straight, obnoxious New Yorker &gt; DC Political insider...except when it's in your face Donald Trump?
@BleacherReport Well...didn't they rob him of a solid run game, a stout defense, and solid special teams play?
@JackPosobiec Isn't "smocking" some Q term?
@Rich_Campbell Rams too cold!
@johndonaldsonjr @AlGaldi No thanks...Ozzy's days of draft brilliance have passed him by.
@_willcompton Bad Santa
@aaronbronsteter @arielhelwani Dana White = New Don King #danawhiteisthenewdonking
@arielhelwani Let's continue to prop up Henry Cejudo when he didn't even beat Mighty Mouse! 		UFC is failing...and people are noticing more and more. 		Dana White = New Don King
@DailyCaller Shoulda been 8 to start, but they're too worried their "elite" schools won't get into the finals, and see ratings drop.
@yashar He prefers echo chambers, I guess.
@Tarik_ElBashir Except when you put a talented 3rd string QB on the practice squad to be plucked away by a division foe in favor of keeping 2 QB's. Nate Sudfeld should have been on the field tonight...that's how you prepare. Gruden needs to go!
@SenSchumer Except you have no desire for bi-partisanship...you're a partisan hack!
@czabe After watching how this team came out against the Eagles with 11 days of prep, after the performance on Thanksgiving, you think anyone should have confidence in this guy? Let he and Bruce go to Las Vegas!
@kevinsheehanDC Nate Sudfeld?
@ByMikeJones Well...I'm going to bite on your click bait! You're an idiot!
@KurtSchlichter Yet, we're the only country maintaining the standards set in the Paris Accords.
@TIME Yet the US is the only country in the G20 who maintains the standards set in the Paris Accords.
@Kgskins26 Yup...it's why I watched only a handful of games for 2 years. I decided to give this season a shot, and have watched many games this year...many good games. But as the season wears on, important games are being decided by absolutely terrible calls, at the worst possible moments.
@BreitbartNews Who cares? Poor ratings for their propaganda got the series cancelled. Capitalism strikes again!
@discoque5 He's a major part of the poor performances on the field.
@SymoneDSanders @JessicaTarlov No they are not! They are illegals who have refused asylum in Mexico, therefore they are no longer asylum seekers! They are invaders!
@SenGillibrand What about Union interests? Should unions get their influence over you?
@Scott_Eric_Yep @jonfavs @MonicaLewinsky Right, because you know she was the one perpetuating the affair when he was the one with a history of extra-marital affairs/assaults on women.
@mememoreme @jonfavs @yashar @MonicaLewinsky This is the kind of nonsense I just cannot fathom! I remember details, too. Hilary was a bully to all the women who came forward!
@HelenWheels01 @MonicaLewinsky @jonfavs Did Hilaryever apologize to her for her vicious attacks/bullying?
@jonfavs But Hilary was the biggest bully of them all when this went down. She was vicious in her attacks against all the women who came out to tell of their experiences with the Predator in Chief.
@KirkHerbstreit @OhioStateFB Why? We're one week out from an OT win that could very well have been a loss had the WR not dropped the ball on the 2pt conversion...to a bad UMD team!!!! They should not be talked about for a playoff unless everyone collapses. Even then? UCF is better.
@stephenasmith @UMichFootball @OhioStateFB Worst part? Ohio St now a "possible" playoff team because of it, after luckily escaping a loss by a poor MD in OT the week before. F**K! I wish that kid had caught the 2-point conversion so this BS got nipped in the bud! UCF deserves more than OSU! But polls will put OSU ahead.
@rosado_angelica @HummingbirdRSO @politico The article is bullshit! I am in the real estate business! It is far easier to buy a house today for any age group! Do you know what 18% interest with minimum 20% down is like? Today you can get a 0% down USDA loan with 5-6% interest!
@HummingbirdRSO @politico The article is a bunch of bullshit! I am in the real estate business! It is far easier to buy a house today than it was 30 years ago, for any age group!!!!
@KassyDillon Yes
@HummingbirdRSO @politico Millennials are classified as 20's to early 30's. That demographic has struggled to purchase a home of their own for a long time...this is nothing new. Like someone else said, it is just the current expectation of this group to have what they want, regardless of work required.
@politico I don't know where you come up with such nonsense. It's been difficult for 20 somethings to buy their own houses for years! This is not some new phenomenon!
@MSNBC @MaddowBlog What? Gavin and Jerry both thanked him for his support of their efforts in Cali!
@bmurph13 @dcsportsbog I don't hate them, I've invested 10s of thousands over the years supporting them...he's correct whether he likes the team or not. They're mediocre. Coming off a loss that's 1-3 in last 4 games losing a 3 game lead over Dallass in the division. Time for Gruden and Allen to go.
@JBallSr @crossings19 @NUFC_FAN_98 @AlGaldi @Reddslim I love Doug Williams, but he's not the answer either. We need a real GM, not another former player who brings sentiment to the position so fans stay on board with the direction of the team. I thought Scott Mac was it, until I saw him still drinking when he 1st got here.
@JC_law2009 @AlGaldi Yeah, one of them Kerrigan was in the backfield as Zeke had already run past him...did not contain the edge.
@AlGaldi @JC_law2009 Difference was AP could not get going, his old legs were toast about 2 weeks ago, but w sheer will he was still productive. Dallas had the ball more, and was able to continue to plug away. Perrine needs to step up, and step up hugely if this team does have a chance.
@ProudResister Hall and Oates
@CR OK, but this is easily the best Thanksgiving day television sequence of all time! 	https://t.co/YDz8eFIC8A
@czabe That was more of a hold than Norman the previous week, but the NFL needs to let that ticky tack shit slide if the QB is almost on his ass throwing the ball away to avoid a sack. It did not affect the play!
@AlGaldi @team980 Down the stretch, they don't play a top 5 RB in the league. Saquon is the only one to worry about, but we should dominate the Giants again. We can split with Eagles, and it would be tough to beat Titans and Jags, but we can. McCoy gets reps w 1st team, he'll improve. Possible
@czabe With Colt having a full week to play with the 1st team, and hopefully Tomsula and Manusky pushing their guys, because we know Gruden won't...10-6 is not out of the question. We have some poor teams, and a couple a mediocre teams. All depends on how much a drop off at RB
@Bucketsandbirds @andypollin1 @Redskins Like there is some invisible force paralyzing whatever QB is under center long enough for all the fans to scratch their heads!
@richardbranson I see you rebuilt after the hurricane.
@SenTomCotton Same to you Senator!
@andypollin1 @Redskins Been this poor for at least 8 years. Does Gruden even practice it during the week?
@KialoHQ Well, if the young Congresswomen (who married her brother to sneak him into the US) is going to be granted the opportunity to wear her hijab in Congress...then yes!
@ByMikeJones This is new to you? I swear Gruden must never practice the 2 minute drill.
@stephenasmith @ZagMBB @DukeMBB You mean Duke being over rated in early season polls doesn't shock you?
@SenGillibrand I'm grateful Hilary Clinton is not the US President. I am also grateful she will likely run again, just so I can watch her lose again. Couldn't happen to a nicer person!
@Julianaherennow @SethAMandel @SenJohnMcCain Like him calling his wife a C**T?
@Rsoaker27 @Petedogg50 @stipemiocic @dc_mma @JonnyBones Dana White = New Don King
@philthemmadude @LavinTimothy @LTspeaks @JoeJet13 @fastarelli @Ben_Jessop1 @stipemiocic @dc_mma If it were Flyweight, or even welterweight you'd have a point, not in the heavy weight division does this hold water. Stipe is without a doubt the #1 contender and should get a chance at a rematch, but Dana White is the new Don King.
@WashTimes Meh...she's just trying to get her 15 minutes back after her horribly performing shows failed in every market.
@DilfersDimes I wish Washington had chosen you over Heath Shuler!
@john_keim Yeah, too bad Snyder couldn't have seen that and let him take over for Gruden!
@BGObsession @Redskins Over the year's this is a match up I'd rarely feel good about. I feel more confident about this game than I have about any game all season. Dallas is still one dimensional and over rated. If we stop Zeke as well as we did last time out, make Dak win it...we win. @ColtMcCoy
@NolteNC @BreitbartNews Look, Tapper at least tries on occasion. Acosta and Cuomo are far worse then he is.
@Rich_Campbell Yeah, last week my FF team lost by 2.4...Justin Tucker had a bye so I chose Parker! All I needed was 1 FG!!!!!! I hate Cody Parker! Ok...not really, that would be foolish. But that summa b***h!
@joeylogano Wish you'd been more mature when you were with JGR! You could have had 2 of these by now.
@MyTeeQuinn77 @john_keim Haha! Well...duh!
@MrChickSports I was screaming at my TV! It is the single most frustrating thing about the NFL and why I turned it off for 2 years...the inconsistency of the officiating. You cannot possibly call Norman, if you don't call the Texans on that pass to Doctson. Interesting to see what league says.
@RapSheet Stellar season? Did you watch any Redskins' football this year?
@czabe It won't be. Guice should be well coming off injury, but I'd like to keep Peterson for a backup. I would be surprised to see Smith not our QB next year with a 1st or 2nd rounder behind, waiting his turn. And we need  top tier WR in FA...no more expecting youth to take over.
@john_keim God no!
@kevinsheehanDC If refs call the pass interference against Doctson like they SHOULD have, it would be a moot point.
@czabe Well, it does make our 1st and 2nd round pick in next year's draft interesting.
@Kgskins26 Seattle fans are the worst! With my arm in a sling, they the trash at me and challenged me in a fight everywhere I went. Had my arm not been in a sling, I feel I may have been attacked because I would not have stood for what they put me through...i'd have been fighting.
@MatthewBetley Speaker Pelosi almost guarantees a Trump 2nd term.
@MarkDice @DineshDSouza Wouldn't be a bit surprised if he manufactured the whole thing to become relevant.
@KirstenPowers @NancyPelosi Actually, the GOP is hoping Nancy stays out front...she assures Trump of another term.
@john_keim @RedskinsRD21 @triadscott Yeah, while I am a fan of building through  the draft, they have to be able to add compliments to the team via FA as well. Allen Robinson comes to mind.
@stephenasmith @KDTrey5 Why not a return home to the Wizards?
@SenSchumer Just wondering, were you calling for legislation to protect for Ken Star? Of course you weren't...that is nonsense!
@LeslieMarshall You got them! Not always Democrat, but...579 to 1.
@steveschillin10 @secupp You talking about Judge Kavanaugh?
@randalladams @Egypxican @KirstenPowers @Ocasio2018 But he can afford to get an apartment if he wanted one. He is a workaholic, frugal, and understands how to prioritize finances. I never once heard him cry because he didn't get what he feels he "deserves".
@jpodhoretz @JVLast While I don't believe it is "defining"...I do believe he uses the tactic intentionally. Some times it works, some times it doesn't.
@randalladams @Egypxican @KirstenPowers @Ocasio2018 And over in MD, as far north as Baltimore, the housing is much more affordable...less than an hour's train ride away.. I know, I'm in the real estate biz over here. Regular people live where their means dictate. Why can't she?
@RobbRealtyAtl Haha! I was referring to a catering job we once did on Thanksgiving. ;)
@Egypxican @randalladams @KirstenPowers @Ocasio2018 I have little sympathy for anyone complaining about housing when they hit the lottery as a member of Congress. The benefits that come along with a starting salary of $174k a year job, are incalculable. She'll have access to millions of dollars over he career in DC. Poor baby!
@RobbRealtyAtl Any recipes for a good Thanksgiving martini?
@lethal5point7 I used to attend between 6-9 games a year, spent tens of thousands over the years. Why I don't go? Because I wasted tens of thousands over the years to have a mediocre product shoved down my throat. Tired of asshats suggesting I am the problem. Dan Snyder is the problem!!!
@BreitbartNews Was he saying the same thing when Eric Holder was in charge?
@Egypxican @randalladams @KirstenPowers @Ocasio2018 And in just a few months, she'll be earning almost 3.5k a week. She can replace that 15k in just 3 months. How long will it take you to save 15k?
@kevinsheehanDC I'd like to see if Arguayo could get his head back on straight because he is one of NCAA's best of all time.
@SenTomCotton So just a question for all you Harvard Law grads out there, oh wait! That's Tom Cotton...anyway...is the US Embassy consider sovereign?
@YgageG @CNN That might have been the single most stupid tweet I have ever seen. You aren't very smart, are you?
@Bucket_HTTR @BGObsession What are you talking about? With 9 minutes left in the game Smith missed a wide open Davis, he missed an opportunity to stick the dagger in. Left w/ a 13 point lead, they have QB w/ 4 - 4th Q come backs this year down 14 points or more, game was not in hand. You are being obtuse.
@SkinsRealm @BurgundyBurner Downgrade? If we can grade him on a single performance, I have not seen Lavaou play that well since we beat the Rams at FedEx 3 years ago with Matt Jones running the ball. https://t.co/8jsb7G57uY
@saaay_whaat He came into game as #9 QB in the league with at least 40 less pass attempts that anyone ahead of him, 2 4th Q comebacks that were 14 points or more, and almost 2 more that fell short. So yeah, dynamic QB who threw over 400 today.
@Bucket_HTTR Come on man, Zeke is not the best RB in the league! Todd Gurley is far better!
@CNN Riiiiiight! Because telling an audience of black voters the GOP would put them back in chains is not "demeaning".
@Bucket_HTTR @BGObsession Not it wasn't...we had a 16-3 lead w/ 9 minutes left in the game with one of the most dynamic QB's in the game on the opposite side. They don't call him Fitzmagic for thing. Thank God our defense caused turnovers at exactly the right moment, and Tampa proved why they're 3-6.
@ByMikeJones Once again, these players are challenging those of us who have gone from spending $10's of thousands, to not attending a game in years because of the product on the field. And when you suck at home, are we supposed to cheer you? Browns crushed Falcons who crushed us. Say what?
@Bucket_HTTR @BGObsession Nah...they are 6-3 because of AP. Yeah a couple more turnovers could have happened under another QB, but Davis would have been hit in stride! As well as, many other opportunities we left points on the field because Smith sucks.
@ehdomenech I go see my dad in Arlington every Memorial Day, take my kids with me every year.
@SenGillibrand If by suppressing votes, you mean illegal votes, then yes. One side is suppressing while the other is making sure they're counted.
@BurgundyBurner Umm...NO! I would rather we take care of business than see the Pokes win any game!
@RiggosRag That performance by our OL was very good today! Alex Smith is playing scared all the time. The difference between Fitz and Smith is obvious...Smith is tentative, afraid to take chances while Fitz makes every effort to give his team a chance to win.
@kevinsheehanDC Yes to all, but Alex Smith once again looks pedestrian. It's easy to over look when you win, but that missed opportunity to Davis to put a dagger in the Bucs was enough for me to suggest it may be time for Colt McCoy. This offense is anemic with Smith at QB.
@secupp @Mediaite You're wrong, the Obama White House was far more active in illegal activities that go unnoticed because the mainstream media was complicit in the cover up.
@RiggosRag We lose this game, he takes much of the blame. The OL has played great, and the defense puts him in position to win...then he over throws a wide open Davis? Inexcusable!
@Tsikoya @BreitbartNews You're making yourself look stupid.
@john_keim It was his protection, they held.
@Tsikoya @BreitbartNews You have no idea who I did or did not vote for. But nice try painting me how you want. Good effort for legitimate discourse, asshat!
@john_keim This is maddening! Fitz is tearing us to shreds, but we're up 6-3. Just goes to show why they are 3-5 and not 5-3.
@RiggosRag Time fort Colt McCoy to make an appearance.
@HogsHaven Time to seriously consider Colt McCoy!
@martini3102 @HogsHaven That line is playing well, today. Can't blame them.
@BreitbartNews No, we're afraid of any person with such a lack of understanding finance, in charge of the finance committee.
@JeffFlake Do you want the DNC to have your seat?
@KassyDillon OK...so we have one. Very loving, loyal dog. Good size for many, needs exercise. Said I'd never own a hound...once they lock onto a smell, they'll bark, and bark, and bark, and bark, and bark, and bark, and...you get the point. We love him, but I will never get another one!
@BreitbartNews Anyone Trump puts in the AG position will be a constitutional crisis to this guy.
@JovaisG JG, I cannot imagine what it must feel like to be in your position, however I can say your continued positive outlook will get you through.
@RealJamesWoods We love you, you cantankerous summama bitch! Thanks for helping through the fires! I have not been personally affected, but appreciate you using your platform to help! F**K the naysayers who challenged you for your generosity, claiming you're an egoist.
@ProducerKen FFS, she is going to have a vote for federal legislation and can't even rent? Tells us all about her. Problem isn't that she "can't afford" rent, its that she won't live where she can afford. Plenty of housing available for her in the DC metro. But but but! She's a Congressman!
@TomSmash2 @DailyCaller I just looked it up before I made the tweet, the next election it will be on the ballot again. That's just 2 years from now.
@DailyCaller Great...let's make Ted Cruz AG and then have a run off for his seat with the success Beto just had. Come on Dan! That's just nonsense!
@KassyDillon She won't have an office until January?
@townhallcom Bwahahahaha! There is plenty of affordable housing around DC, it's just a matter if she wants to live with the elites, or she wants to slum it up with the regular folk. Such nonsense!
@jaketapper @whca It's not their coverage!!! It's their behavior!!!! He clearly stated they need to respect the office, not they need to change the content of their reporting.
@CNN Yet, she forgives Hilary Clinton for starting the rumor in the first place?
@SethAMandel I keep hearing this about Ford, but never see any video or audio, or any other proof of threats toward her like Tucker Carlson's...or even Kavanaugh's. She's just trying to remain relevant since she got a taste of fame.
@chicksonright There isn't even a candidate yet. Nothing the DNC has currently rumored to be running, can beat him unless he does something stupid or the economy falls apart!
@DougJones Meh...in 2 years you'll be a distant memory in the Senate so cry foul all you want!
@aplusk You have no idea what you're talking about! Stick to what you're good at...what that is, who knows? But stick to it.
@jpodhoretz They can see your dreams?
@aplusk Just shut up and act...you're not good at activism. Oh wait! You're not good at acting, either! You should thank your lucky stars you're pretty.
@thenation Right! And it was the "Far Right" who nearly busted Tucker Carlson's door down in "protest"
@ChrisCuomo I often criticize you for being a narcissist shill for the DNC, but you sir deserve kudos for calling this what it is.
@jpodhoretz It wasn't inadvertent, it was reactionary. But, he bullied the microphone away from her. If you cannot see that, not sure what to say.
@derekahunter @Acosta @CNN Mini arm push and twist is minimizing, he used enough force when doing so to affect a considerable reaction...her arm bends from the force of the push. That is battery. However, it could be considered battery what she initially did, by trying to remove the object from his hand.
@jpodhoretz Yup! He knew it before he went out there and played them like a fiddle. So what is everyone fighting over? Did Jim Acosta actually touch the intern?
@E_Vaan @Hunterpsujoepa @gt_ok @PressSec Her arm bends from the force of his arm blocking her...you're delusional!
@guypbenson Guy, you can clearly see his left hand affect her left arm to bend when he pushes it down to keep her from taking the microphone. It may be exaggerated to "ATTACK"  but the fact remains, he did put his hand on her. That is battery, not assault.
@crackedpots @richardferris @radonnawillis @Acosta Umm...it is her job to hand the mic from one reporter to the next you idiot!
@KenDilanianNBC @Acosta @PeterAlexander You think Acosta pushing the arm of a woman away for trying to do her job, graceful, then you sir are an idiot!
@AmySpeaks1 @PhilipRucker @Acosta @PeterAlexander @AprilDRyan Haha! look at the tape again, she NEVER touched the tie! She grabbed the mic! It always amazes me how people see what they want, and not reality!
@PhilipRucker @Acosta @PeterAlexander @AprilDRyan And Jim Acosta attacked a female staffer!
@Acosta Jim Acosta the "grand stander in chief", who continually pushes forth a false narrative, talking about dishonesty. How rich!
@DianneG @jaketapper Well...was he incorrect?
@secupp Was he incorrect?
@MaVASteve @ChrisLoesch They won't all vote. But yeah...that's a huge win for Dems.
@_AnthonyCo @judimc6 @ChrisLoesch Horrible!
@WhiskeyandB @ChrisLoesch Because he has motivated Dems like no one else in the country has since Obama in 2012.
@ChrisLoesch Yup
@LarrySabato I was thinking the same thing.
@Acosta GOP won the house by a VERY large number, Dems may only win by a few seats.
@USAA It's a water heater, not a hot water heater! You don't heat HOT water!!!!!
@SuzanneElizabe @mkhammer Wait! Suzanne, you know MKH?
@dc_mma @allelbows Both divisions are weak, it's why Stipe kept his belt so long. 		Jon Jones!
@NBCSRedskins Sick &amp; tired of players talk about true fans when we criticize their shitty performance! He talked about how great he &amp; Haha are,m then we watched 'em get destroyed. Don't question me as a fan and the tens of thousands I've spent on this team over the past 40 years, do your job!
@mkhammer Yeah, pretty sure that is standard toddler girl uniform. https://t.co/5JBpqy8AHN
@kenglishesq1 I think I'm gonna have a BLT sandwich. Mmm...bacon! Too bad I ran out of the fresh bacon we had from the hogs we raised to slaughter.
@Cap_Institute First off, let's stop with the Democratic talking point..."ASSAULT RIFLE"...if they are legally carrying these guns, don't be a hypocrite &amp; act like Nancy Pelosi would. 	Actually do a little research to find out who they are &amp; if they can legally carry a firearm. #dontbelikedems
@RobinHi80005817 @jaketapper Huh? You don't believe Don Lemon said White Men are the real terrorist threat? 		https://t.co/ISHiHkTPuH
@Ciruelasverdes @secupp @cpicciolini Nah, I have a problem with that guy.
@jaketapper @AriFleischer “During the past 22 months, not one person caught or identified as the aggressor in an anti-Semitic hate crime has been associated with a far right-wing group, Mark Molinari, commanding officer of the police department’s Hate Crimes Task Force, told me.”
@ChrisLoesch Yup! I will say a few of those livers shots he took were probably taking their toll on him well into the 3rd round. But he let his guard down and got caught.
@jaketapper If it were a Trump supporter, you're headline would include that. This guy is an Obama guy and you ignore it? Why do you do that, Jake?
@SenGillibrand You're always fighting...so angry! I have nothing against women in office, but voting for women just to vote for women makes no sense. In that case you end up with Mazie Hirono.
@RedskinsRD21 Why? Pernell McPhee is starting to come on, Smith and Kerrigan continue to set the edge, and Ryan Anderson is a solid rotation guy. Irvin is a dirty player. No thanks!
@secupp @cpicciolini Right, because we're supposed to believe a guy trying to sell a book.
@Kgskins26 That's interesting...I've been a few times, Alstott for 2 being one of them...and I was treated well, had a great time.
@RealDeanCain While I don't want it...another Speaker Pelosi will guarantee a 2nd Trump Term. And Tom Arnold...grasp it with everything you have! Hold on as tight as possible!!! You know what I'm talking about, it's called RELEVANCE! Not that you had any w/out Rosanne anyway.
@GabeHoff First off, yes the blemish belongs on her record. She made a mistake and needs consequences of her actions. No she does not need to go to jail, no she does not need probation, this will get squashed, but she deserves to be held accountable, permanent record is the consequence.
@secupp @jaketapper @Mediaite Well...I have yet to hear of him sending the IRS after any of you like Obama did to James Rosen.
@DRUDGE_REPORT I wish he'd have followed me and punched me...I could use an extra half million bucks! Haha!
@jaketapper Right, because Don Lemon calling all white men terrorists is a soothing, peaceful characterization of an entire class of people that creates such a warming environment amidst the current political climate!
@SenSchumer The people who trust you must be very stupid. Harry Reid and Barak Obama inflated the deficit more than every other President in the history of this country, WITH YOUR HELP!!!! Health care costs rose because of that stupid ACA bill YOU PASSED!!!
@RealKyleMorris Makes me sad for my alma mater!
@AAdam06454780 @FoxNews Right...caravan is full of actual refugees. ***sarcasm alert*** You can't be stupid enough to think infantry soldiers are being sent to mow down invaders. They're mostly admin staff to help with the bureaucracy border patrol is facing. Protect border from invasion of ineligible.
@Ihaveagaurdcat @maddow Umm...are you that stupid? Do I really need to explain this to you?
@FoxNews Terrible waste? This is the duty of the US Armed Forces! Protect our borders!
@maddow Meh, DNC operatives just framed a guy in South Florida to garner votes against Trump.
@WillCainShow @willcain What Tua is doing is far more impressive than Mahomes. We've seen 3 different Mahomes in an Andy Reid offense, McNabb, Vick, and now Patrick. We've never seen a QB like Tua in a Saban offense.
@SenGillibrand George Washington born in VA, Jefferson VA, John and Sam Adams MA, Ben Franklin Boston, James Madison VA, John Jay NY, James Monroe VA, Govenour Morris NY. STOP THE LIES!!!!
@stephenasmith @ShowtimeTate Haha! A 3rd round pick for a rental for 8 games or more if they make the playoffs?
@brianstelter Well, since he's telling the truth...meh.
@RepJoeKennedy @realDonaldTrump You sir, are full of crap! First off, you're lucky enough to have your name or you'd be nobody! 2nd, everything you just said is a lie! Only illegal criminals, only terrible ACA, he is not going to kill all trans, we are world leaders in environment issues. You lie!
@john_keim No trades! No players worth a trade when the only position of need, WR, can be filled with a free agent for cheap. Yes, Dez Bryant is a head case, but he is better than anyone we have out wide...let's sign him til the end of the season and address that position in off-season.
@CoryBooker Don't you and Keith Ellison hang out?
@JonahNRO Yeah, I just watched much of it again lately, it's not a good movie. When I was a kid and saw it in the theatres, I thought it was the greatest movie ever. Now? It sucks.
@CNN Obama was playing golf the day Americans were slaughtered in Benghazi.
@DanHellie Yeah, not a fan of the way he sucks up to Troy Aikman on the NFL broadcasts, especially when they call a Dallass game. But he's one of the best in the business!
@secupp Sounds like Obama apologists for 8 years during such egregious acts as the Ft Hood shooter, suggesting Americans in Benghazi were killed because of a video to save a re-election bid, completely ignoring their responsibility in Border Patrol Brian Terry's murder.
@KirstenPowers Ha! If you think anyone who fills her spot will get the money she did, you're mistaken!
@secupp But it is incumbent upon the media to be honest...which much of the media has not been! You can dislike the man, but you cannot defend the dishonest members of your trade who mislead Americans who actually still trust CNN, MSNBC, the NY Times, and other left wing rags!
@cspan @BarackObama Yeah, it must have been nice having people in charge at the FBI who were willing to hide your corruption.
@DailyCaller Is she taking responsibility for the Ricin attacks?
@DonaldJTrumpJr Actually, in many states throughout the country one can hunt their own land without a license. However, VOTE TESTER OUT!
@BreitbartNews Just a matter of time. She lacked ratings, and their ideology.
@joshuamckerrow Well, to be fair...they weren't the "mainstream media" that he was referring.
@KassyDillon I hate going to a restaurant and asking for real maple syrup and being told the corn syrup on the table is real maple. I want to slap a...oh, I'm just kidding. I would never harm anyone. But that shit irks me!
@allahpundit Oh how the mighty have fallen. She could have been running Fox.
@timkaine Because you attached a bunch of pork to that money! You're the one being dishonest, and people who won't do their due diligence will believe your lies!
@Kgskins26 You are correct.
@RealJamesWoods Dude is so full of shit! He has a name because his conflicts with Trump. No one knew him before that! He revels in the rallies he attends. What a lying dirtbag!
@TheJuanWilliams @thehill What are you talking about? That's not true! It's been a basis for many candidates on the ballot this election. This statement is absolutely false...it's a lie!
@BurgundyBurner Not in basketball, which is why they went to the Big 10.
@FoxBusiness No, but I'll take a 5% cut across the board.
@trish_regan No no no! She's the GOP gift that keeps on giving!
@RealJamesWoods I was asking myself the same question.
@FoxNews @GeraldoRivera It is as group of mostly young men who just forced their way past an entry point. How is that not to be seen as a threat?!?!?!
@BGObsession And line Quinton Dunbar up on the other edge.
@NRO @RichLowry If the authorities won't do anything to curb the attack on our nation from Antifa, then I have no problem with a force standing up against them to deter their lawlessness.
@allahpundit Then lose the general election. Haven't we had enough of her costing the GOP seats in Congress. FFS, Palin was responsible for Harry Reid having 6 more years to try to destroy this country! #goawaysarah
@BGObsession Because the Cowturds are the darlings of the NFL.
@SenGillibrand Are you serious? Are you friggin serious? Never mind that Obama spent more than every other President in history, combined!!!!
@AdamSchefter Yup, I saw it when it happened and thought the stadium officials need to do something about that.
@stephenasmith @AaronRodgers12 But but but! He doesn't have 5 Championships! ***sarcasm alert*** Been arguing this point for years. Brady is special, but the Pats organization is the best in Football. Put Rodgers in Brady's situation, he wins 5 at least.
@abbydphillip Yeah...1/1000 is Indian. Nice try!
@JohnClaytonNFL Redskins! Alex Smith needs a more better target!
@SenGillibrand Yup! And the unions do the same!
@BurgundyBurner I don't know, but I'd trade Paul Richardson and Jay Gruden for Amarai Cooper!
@SenGillibrand Oh stop! We are that promise! For you to say we're supposed to be is so dishonest! You may be the single most dishonest politician behind Blumenthal!
@SkinsRealm Carlos Hyde would have been a better acquisition. AP is good, but Carlos Hyde is better at this stage of their games.
@BurgundyBurner @BGObsession There was good, but it was a lot..."more of the same." Gruden needs to stop trying to stick a dagger in an opponent early in the game. Just take what is given you. And there was no adjustment during the half, again! We scored 6 points in the 2nd half and held on for the W.
@Rich_Campbell Gase is lucky!
@secupp It just baffles my mind!
@AlGaldi Yeah, Gruden left too many points on the field trying to put the game away too early.
@AlGaldi Is Dustin Hopkins hurt?
@benshapiro Mango italian ice #1!
@arielhelwani DC won't go to Bellator.
@ChrisLoesch She said she was a cop, she should face charges, it's a felony to impersonate a peace officers.
@SenGillibrand Well, depends what 51% of women there were in Congress...if they are all like you, we'd have a Chicken Little situation where they'd all be crying, "The sky is falling!"
@KennedyNation YES!!!!! Had to switch back and forth between you and Tucker because I am too lazy to DVR you! Now I can watch him, then you!
@benshapiro They'll be replacing the 5 with you soon enough.
@eldon_wriston @jaketapper People not Unions lobbyists!
@benshapiro What did Biden say on a hot mic in the Oval Office?
@KyleKashuv And Biden said what on a hot mic in the Oval Office?
@JoeTrippi Well, since you're not a scientist...you might want to STFU! @BigJoeBastardi could answer this for you.
@QBAlex_Smith Sounds good, but the game he played Monday night was horrible!
@DanRather Truth and justice? You were fired by CBS for making up stories that would do political damage to a President you did not want re-elected! You lied, got caught, got fired, and you want to talk about "Truth and Justice"?
@allahpundit He will not make her the UN Ambassador.
@HTTRoom And next week, they will likely lose to a team led by a QB that has owned this team.
@secupp @CNN "It's possible..." The new standard for journalists stirring the pot. You used to be above that shit!
@stephenasmith Stop! Jason Garrett should be signed to another 10 years for them!!!!!!! #HTTR
@stephenasmith How about talking with the NFL to let teams play football without intervening on behalf of the team they want to advance? The better team won last night, no doubt...but the officials sure did whatever they could to help them out when they didn't need to.
@kathrynw5 @DailySignal VP
@KatiePavlich Nope, she'll take the next year to be with family, Pence will resign to begin the re-election campaign, and Trump will put her on the ticket for 2020.
@benshapiro You think Lindsay Graham will make a good attorney general?
@Acosta Did you yell a question she could not possibly hear, and you're gonna report it as her ignoring you?
@NBCSRedskins Umm...no they weren't.
@SenGillibrand Hey, how do you feel about Kavanaugh hiring all women to be on his staff?
@Acosta Oh no! Jim Acosta is being ignored again!!! Stop the world! You're such a narcissist!
@DailyCaller Her new demographic is not country music fans, so she'll be just fine.
@Acosta Nope, just Kamala Harris and Blumenthal.
@Judas3rd @ThankYouSashi @arielhelwani Conor gets the fight because he is the biggest draw. Ferguson v McGregor is the next fight while Khabib serves his yr long bullshit suspension.
@AdamSchefter And with the game on the line, McVay went for it on 4th and inches, to deny Seattle a chance to win the game. I bet Pete Carroll is sorry he called that time out.
@stephenasmith Delusional! Basketball has a tremendous following, but the NBA would never get same support as soccer on the international scene...even if the finals were every four years. You know they do this thing called the Olympics, and basketball isn't highest draw EVERY 4 YEARS!
@stephenasmith @Panthers Did they win?
@NickDiCianni @tovetalk @izzumtq @TheNotoriousMMA You think a guy like him is winning at life?
@austinbuffalo @FoxBusiness That's what's missed. In an interview a number of Amazon employees, they were not so excited about the news. One employee who said she currently earned 14 and change an hour, but bonuses and benefits she was not sure she would still receive, it meant less money for her per hour.
@AlGaldi #danawhiteisthenewdonking
@Steveospeak I am not a big "rsik taker'...but I was thinking he should go for it there. It makes sense.
@GretchenCarlson Because they weren't elected to vote on issues based on how they feel, they were elected to do what the people who elected want them to do? Polls generally indicate what the people want.
@SenFeinstein Terrible treatment? You're such a liar!
@TwitchyTeam And wasn't the hearing so she could present the "evidence"?
@ALeftoverture @LADeplorable197 @SenFeinstein Right but fools would elect someone to be President who admitted he was a drunk, drug addled, dog eating, bully...like Barry Soetero. That's the right person to be in charge of the free world!    ***sarcasm alert***
@chicksonright He was mocking her...but so what? Her story is falling apart.
@Acosta Yeah, that is until her story began to fall apart!
@RadioFreeTom If you actually believe the people accusing him of these assaults, you're a sad man. You need help.
@AdamSchefter Well...15 yards for every hit on the QB, untold yardage from the simple hand contact on a receiver, and the various other rules in place to make the game so explosive will do that.
@Acosta He's right! You guys are out to take down his presidency, and there is no debating that. Many...including from your network...have stated as much!!
@jaketapper @Eagles I was about to like the post, until I saw Eagles. Boo!
@CNN Try living in a Muslim nation where you'd need 4 eye witnesses to your rape if you want justice!
@DLoesch Hidden documents didn't work, rape accusation didn't work, angry drunk is next! Oooh ooh! He said he could drink in MD legally when he was a senior in high school! Ooh ooh! He threw drink in face! Sickening! So tired of it! Time for the GOP to grow a pair and vote!
@byrdinator ZIP IT!!!
@ByMikeJones Booze?
@DailyCaller The sexual assault claims are falling apart, so now it's his temper!!!
@weckyboody @boymomvb @JerryDunleavy @AP But DC was within walking distance of Bethesda/Chevy Chase or a bus/metro ride...he could legally drink there when he as 18, and he was 18 for almost 4 months of his senior in high school.
@SoapboxO @JerryDunleavy @AP The headline says he said he could legally drink in MD, he did not. He said seniors could drink legally. When he was a senior in high school, he turned 18 in Feb of 83...he could walk to DC/take metro to DC and drink legally!
@Scott_McCabe @JerryDunleavy @AP Not in DC, which was only a stone's throw away from where he lived.
@FoxNews @FLOTUS Can we do a compare/contrast on her expenditures compared to when Mrs. Obama went?
@KirstenPowers Actually, IT WAS LEGAL TO DRINK less than a mile from where he lived. I've read transcripts, he did not lie! He was legally permitted to drink, in DC...practically walking distance from his house in his senior year of high school!
@TIME I don't care how often you say I should shower...2 times a day is a must!
@bscherff68 Congratulations and Happy Birthday little one! He was born on my son's 1st birthday! HTTR!
@KirkHerbstreit Could have been even crazier had their coach not blown the game for them.
@secupp If it challenges her credibility, gives us a better understanding of who she is, then why wouldn't it be relevant?
@KirstenPowers Nonsense! It's the outrage at the theatrics by Senators like Blumenthal, Harris, and Booker...all 3 of whom should be ashamed at their behavior throughout these proceedings. Shameful! You never struck me as a propagandist before...what happened? Stay away from Cuomo and Cooper!
@john_keim Tomsula does not dictate the tone for the entire team...you really are obtuse!
@john_keim But the TEAM wins in NE. Why are you being obtuse? Skins lack discipline, defense used to wear in 4Q. 2 kids from Bama play a whole game, but no other DL can. You want to attribute that to Tomsula? Point is, they were conditioned for this at Bama! We need more discipline here.
@john_keim Wow, great retort! "Gruen is not Bellichek." John, Alabama has a reputation for hard work, and discipline. Jay Gruden does not instill discipline in his players, far too laid back. By your logic, the interior OL would have been able to be more successful last year under Tomsula.
@jaketapper @CNN It helps to have a President that doesn't create the narrative that the GOP is the enemy like we saw over most of that 7 years.
@john_keim Not surprising, they had a disciplinarian coaching them up in Alabama. Wish we had one of those here. And before you say the NFL is different, I will direct you to Bill Belichek. And, I don't like Bill Belichek!
@Mr_Henson51 @BurgundyBurner Problem has been when to run. Yesterday worked out perfectly, the 1st drive was successful going after the Pack w/ pass, and allowed the run to develop. The week before, it was...run on 1st, run on 2nd, throw. Run still important, but needs to be mixed in.
@MZHemingway Not feel good about themselves? They are in love with themselves and revel what they're doing! Kristen Gilibrand, Mazie Hirono, Chuck Schumer, Blumnethal, Cory Booker, Kamala Harris all have no desire for truth, just power...by any means necessary.
@eric_j_thompson Yup
@ByMikeJones But the injuries! The injuries!
@hughhewitt @JeffFlake Yeah, the same was said about John McCain when his constituents re-elected him on the promise of repeal!
@stephenfhayes And the tactic is a brilliant political ploy...she has turned the mid-terms toward the Dems across the board with the GOP hates women narrative this story helps to advance.
@CRTV @Ocasio2018 @WilkowMajority But but but...she didn't keep the clothing! She just wears it to represent...wait! What is she representing in $3ooo worth of clothing? Oh...I know! She represents the leaders of socialism who live in riches, while their people eat rabbits!  #shhhbeveryveryquietwererabbithunting
@ABC @KoryMclain Exactly! Elections have consequences, and because of Obama we have Trump! Thanks Obama!
@KoryMclain @Guds_barn @ScarletKnight89 @2KKing14 @Billy81T @BTGreen87 @deedee862 @DegreesSeven @dougvaughn8 @gbarajas3 @gzuckier @ImMrLoanLee @jambrix32 @Kha_Beleth kory, how do you expect to be taken seriously if you don't believe in science?
@AriFleischer Oh stop! It's meaningless. Ford has manufactured a lie to advance the DNC cause. This whole charade is just another tactic. She prepped for this years ago.
@ByMikeJones You sure are defensive. I don't care enough. Just find it amusing, that you are so subjective when it comes to the Redskins, the tweet was unnecessary. All of the NFL are dealing with injuries right now...Dan Snyder piss you off or something? You and Sally buddies?
@SenWhitehouse Right...because holding on to the info Feinstein had since July was the proper way to handle the accusations! *sarcasm alert*
@politico Did you guys report Swallwell's response to Susan Collins?
@ByMikeJones OK, gotta generate some clicks somehow. Gotcha.
@ByMikeJones It's league wide...no need to manufacture drama with this team, there is already plenty to go around.
@MonicaCrowley @ChuckGrassley Grassley needs to stick to his guns and say she had her chance. These tactics are growing old! The GOP needs to governing scared!
@HawleyMO @clairecmc Should bode well for her senatorial re-election bid in a state Trump took by such a wide margin.
@KFILE I am wondering if the threats are real, or is it more drama created by those around her to make the situation look worse for her? More grandstanding by the left? I mean, doesn't she live in leftist haven?
@NoahPollak Eric Swallwell is a Republican?
@NoahPollak Oh when I first saw the tweet, I thought Valerie was talking about Eric Swallwell, and his treatment of Susan Collins.
@RepSwalwell Well, the gerrymandering in your district 8 years ago certainly helps you maintain control of the 15th, but I hope this type of statement makes the constituents of the 15th see how loathsome your are and you lose your seat. You're disgusting! Bullying a female Senator like that!
@KoryMclain @Guds_barn @ScarletKnight89 @2KKing14 @Billy81T @BTGreen87 @deedee862 @DegreesSeven @dougvaughn8 @gbarajas3 @gzuckier @ImMrLoanLee @jambrix32 @Kha_Beleth So you're anti-science?
@stephenasmith @dallascowboys I completely agree with you...except the local fans who attend games at ATT Stadium. Been to many stadiums in the NFL and outside of Tampa, Dallas had the nicest fans anywhere. It tends to be the dips hits who turned on their home team in favor of a stupid blue star. #traitors
@KirstenPowers Would that be enough to shut the DNC leadership up? I doubt it...
@jaketapper No one I saw said he was kneeling, simply that to sensationalize the situation, he found the very deepest part of the water for effect. It may not be dishonest, but at least disingenuous, and misleading. You guys are pretty good at misleading!
@chuckwoolery @BreitbartNews But the DoJ will still redact any pertinent info that we'd see in those documents.
@HomerMcFanboy What is worse? Jay Gruen does not know how to adjust if his game plan does not work. What's worse than that? Jay Gruen might be the worst 2 minute drill coach in the history of the NFL. Whats worse than that? We'll probably trade for Josh Gordon.
@JayGlazer Every report says no ligament damage, now you're saying ligament damage?
@bobeid93 @john_keim You can keep mediocre as your standard, I refuse. Until they have repeated playoff appearances again, I refuse to give them a dime of mine.
@john_keim They better win, then...otherwise those who have not had enough of the same yo-yo trip will give up like I did 2 years ago. Used to attend 8-9 games a year...won't go again until we've seen repeat playoff berths.
@TheJuanWilliams @realDonaldTrump @public_affairs I simply cannot believe you've reverted to race baiting!
@CoryBooker SPARTACUS!!!!!
@morningmoneyben The problem is, this guys is not marketable like the Trump brand, plus he's white, and male. He'd never get past Booker, Kamala, of Pocahontas.
@staceydash Stacey, she's not even an extremist...this is a fairly common understanding of the Muslim view toward Jews.
@karentravers @cbrennansports No excuse for her behavior because of a double standard. She was not fighting for women on that court she was being petulant! She was pissed off because she was caught and angry because she was exposed! Too bad, she is the GOAT.
@CoryBooker Because you're a Maverick, fighting for the cause! Too bad he will get past the nomination process and become a justice anyway! Thanks Harry Reid!!!
@john_keim Haha! Or beaten down by 27 years of being a Redskins' fan?
@MEPFuller Please name each lie.
@john_keim Good for them, it feels good to win convincingly, but where were the WR's? We cannot rely on our RB's to carry the receiving game, too.
@texasdemocrats @CoryBooker Pan to the 12 people in attendance!
@HuntsmanAbby But her childish antics on the court incited them. If she hadn't acted so petulant, no need to settle crowd. She riled crowd intentionally claiming she is fighting for women. I used to live in PBG, she's not a good person, at all! Just like father!	#williamsfamilyarebadpeople
@Tarik_ElBashir @granthpaulsen Lack of preparation in the pre-season.
@0xKruzr @ryenarussillo Well then, since I did not see that, if it is true...I failed the interwebz this day.
@ChrisLoesch @ufc He's marketable, but the story of a Brit appeals internationally, not to mention Woodley is too outspoken for Dana King.
@ryenarussillo How on earth do you know what the ref was thinking?
@btsportufc @arielhelwani Respect? One of the most common signs of disrespect if offering a man your left hand like Tyrone did. #ufcmanufacturesstoriesforprofits #connorshouldneverfightinufc #danawhiteisthenewdonking
@ChrisLoesch @ufc Do you think he wasn't told to give Till the benefit of the doubt? Woodley has been too outspoken, not a "company man"...they want him out! #danawhiteisthenewdonking
@phildo8 @ChrisLoesch @TWooodley Umm...hasn't the past 5 years of the UFC shenanigans taught you they are getting as bad as boxing with their stories? I mean, look what they've done to get MacGregor back into action...that dude should never fight in UFC again, 6 months later he fights, after brawl.
@PhilipMorriso10 @heraldsunsport @theheraldsun @LeoSchlink Like father like daughter!
@FrankLuntz If that person were to come out in an op-ed piece about Obama, you better believe the leaker would have faced consequences. .
@SethAMandel I was wrong, but they do it and get away with it! Such a lame argument. If you were wrong, you were wrong!
@marklutchman @staceydash They just don't understand that it was Obama's failures that bred Trump! We have Trump because of him, and it appears he just doesn't get it.
@chinabeach59 @heaterman68 @SenGillibrand @realDonaldTrump Not to mention, they hired a company to rebuild their infrastructure that was wholly incapable of doing so, wasting millions!
@allahpundit Unfortunately, this will be used by my dumb liberal friends who believe anything they're told. Kinda like I believe everything Sean Hannity tells me. #justkidiing #seanhannityisaboob
@allahpundit https://t.co/RajNXkb7a2
@RitaPanahi It's simple, it's bleeding into our high schools as a viable method of governance. Not only is it being pushed at colleges, Obama pushed college on kids who couldn't or shouldn't have gone. #tradeschoolisbetterformost #collegeforprofitsucks
@SenGillibrand And you wonder why Donald Trump is President. Keep it up, you'll have him for a second term in 2020.
@KurtSchlichter But did Patrick tell his 8 yr old that they talk like they're honorable, but what about their actions?
@SenatorDurbin If we deserve honesty, then why are you lying?
@realDonaldTrump The US is feared again...even better!
@realDonaldTrump 2 more years of your tweets might change opinions. Give it a break! I want you to succeed, and be a 2 term President, unless you want to make  @nikkihaley the next GOP nominee. Otherwise give us a break...refrain from tweeting all day, every day. #prettypleasewithsugarontop
@allahpundit How do you think it will go on the bottom line? Dicks Sporting Goods well?
@benshapiro Capitalism should work here as it has in every one of these anti-Trump campaigns...Nike's sales will fall. Won't buy another pair. You see how Dicks Sporting Goods is doing.
@KurtSchlichter Meh...the downward spiral continues...no one wants to go to the movies anymore! If it weren't for worldwide viewership, most movies would be complete failures these days.
@SwampySeaweed @shadihamid #keating5
@JonahNRO I probably fit a couple of those.
@bethanyshondark @SethAMandel Well...it is a women's world and his toxic masculinity is unbecoming! 		Hahahaha!
@landpsychology @LizMair As a pro photographer, I must say that is a fantastic image!
@senorrinhatch Not to mention, no matter what they may or may not find, they won't vote for him anyway!
@SenGillibrand What if they don't know how to run a business?
@MatthewBetley How can "anyTHING" believe anything you say!!??!?!?!
@granthpaulsen It's not fake news, but Saban had every right to call her out for exactly what he said she was trying to do! It's the constant attempt to "gotcha"! You guys always want to create a story when the proper thing to do as a coach is not allow you to stir controversy! #mostmediasucks
@SenGillibrand You should be ashamed of yourself!  They failed themselves by electing corrupt leaders who squandered away relief, hired companies ill equipped to get their infrastructure back in place, and hoarded relief supplies for themselves...not delivering it to the people who needed it!
@politico Well...isn't that what McCain wanted?
@andylassner Well?
@johnkruzel But Jim Acosta is.
@politico What did Huma Abedin tell you Lindsey?
@JohnClaytonNFL Yeah, bold...that's what we'll call it.
@AdamSchefter Man, they just paid a lot for a guy who is great, but is he that great? 2 firsts alone is a high price, but to make him the highest paid defender in league history? Must have a lot of cap space.
@allahpundit He has no choice in the matter. If he refuses to speak out against illegals after his own daughter was killed by one, that's his problem. I'm going to use Mollie's murder as support for the need to be more vigilant with illegals in this country.
@politico Yeah, that was John McCain's America! But what about the rest of us who saw it going down the shitter when Obama was President!?!?!
@KurtSchlichter Yeah, I like Meghan and admire her body of work. However, I didn't expect pettiness from her, but she is John McCain's daughter, after all.
@allahpundit Meh...I thought she was above the pettiness, but she is John McCain's daughter after all.
@allahpundit That's right! But the rest of America had slipped into a doldrum of which I was afraid we'd never recover! Had Hilary been elected, the doldrum would have become a cliff!
@SenFeinstein Good!
@czabe Pure lye soap
@TDavenport_NFL @_willcompton If only he was a step faster, he'd probably be a perennial all-star.
@DailyMusicBrk @forcedexit @continetti Because there aren't enough cake makers in the world.
@benshapiro Isn't she supposed to remain objective?
@JaniceDean @KatTimpf Come east In N Out! We will support you!
@DevinNunes hope this precipitates them to start moving east! Bring In and Out here!!!
@SethArtz @SecretarySonny @Cabinet @POTUS No...I get that we don't eat that corn, or feed corn for livestock. But those farmers were not growing corn for fuel 30 years ago, what are they no longer producing in order to field corn for fuel.
@WashTimes They've been trying to find a way to exchange their oil with something other than the dollar for years. They know as long as it's traded in dollars, it favors the US. 		Let'em trade in cryptocurrency now while it's so volatile and could absolutely crush them...big risk for them
@TomiLahren Working their jobs, because they need to support their families? They aren't 20 somethings with no jobs, or funded by Soros to go out and break things. They're hardworking Americans who don't have time to go protest in New Mexico.
@SethArtz @SecretarySonny @Cabinet @POTUS But corn being used for ethanol, takes away from farmers growing food for consumption, less producers of food mean higher prices, no? And ethanol is not that great of a fuel source.
@CalvinPoolidge @mattdpearce @allahpundit Haha! Biden is a democrat, right? BIDEN RULE!!!!! Unbelievable how narrow some people are.
@staceydash This is the unfortunate reality. Meanwhile, politicians make the current opioid epidemic a platform for election...they have no clue how to deal with it. Sociologists, psychiatrists, the medical field in general has been getting it wrong for so long! It will take something more.
@XStrategiesDC @RyanAFournier Now if he'd just slash 15% of the federal workforce!
@LizMair Well, you've been offline all day for 1.
@allahpundit Bad...he'd lose some support the GOP needs going into the mid-terms.
@CalvinPoolidge @mattdpearce @allahpundit Stop! From the election on, the Dems have been doing their very best to minimize Trump's presidency any way possible. Not even a month after sworn in, they were talking about impeachment! Is Trump a bull in a china shop? Yes, but the left has been poker the bear since elected!
@allahpundit Tells you a little about who McCain was..petty, vindictive, insolent, angry...
@AP Good! Now cut the federal workforce by 15% and get that bloated bureaucracy down to manageable levels.
@SethAMandel And next week the dirtbag will be out at some fundraiser or campaign event telling the black community that the GOP will put them back in chains.
@greta Would Gillum even accept?
@mattdpearce @allahpundit Meanwhile, Maxine Waters causes violent mobs to attack Trump supporters at the Hollywood Walk of Fame.
@politico Now, if he'd only cut that workforce by 15%. 		#bloatedbureaucracy #smallergovernment
@RepJoeKennedy Meanwhile in your state, Harvard is discriminating against Asian students! #racistmassachussetts
@timkaine I wish he'd simply let go of 15% of the federal workforce! 		#bloatedbureaucracy #smallergovernment
@Acosta @CNNPolitics OK, this is news to anyone? The same could...and was...said about Obama in 2010, 2012, and 2014. 		Come on, Jim! Give us something with substance, not your agenda!!!
@MelKiperESPN I just want to know why you tore down a house on the national registrar, and now you're selling the vacant land for more than you bought it. Drop the price by 30% and you might get an offer!
@jaketapper I wish he'd just terminate 15% of the federal workforce anyway! The bloat is disgusting!
@SecretarySonny @Cabinet @POTUS But Secretary, doesn't that wreak havoc on food prices?
@NivElis @SethAMandel And if only he'd slash the federal government workforce by 15%, that would get us even further to where we need to be! #toomanyfederalworkers #bloatedbureaucracy
@sahilkapur @jaketapper Ok, now if he were willing to slash the size of the federal government by say...15% that would go even further! He won't because it'd affect his unemployment numbers, but if there was ever a time to do it, it'd be now! We don't need a bloated federal gov!
@JonahNRO How is this surprising? Look at the previous administration and the scandals that should have ended Obama's presidency in 2012, yet he got re-elected by telling lies and the media's willingness to help cover up his lies.
@SenJeffMerkley Such a crock...you know the protocol is to not nominate a justice during a presidential election year. Blame Biden! It's his rule after all!
@MeghanMcCain The image of you weeping over your father's casket reminded me of laying my father to rest in Arlington. Worst day of my life. My prayers to you, and your's. I've been critical of your dad, but you deserve peace, and I pray you have some soon.
@allahpundit Of course not, even in death he shows how petty he was.
@EWErickson @allahpundit They also voted for a man who promised them he'd repeal ACA, but didn't out of a petty vendetta. Suckers! All of them!!!
@thefrankmir Time to retire buddy. I still consider you the greatest talent at HW in MMA history, but, you are not going to regain your glory  You're chin is suspect. I've watched almost every fight in the last 10 years, I've seen you regress. Pack it in before the damage is permanent.
@TandlerNBCS Then they probably should have drafted Connor Williams instead of the flashy Derris Guice? Yeah, I know we got an additional pick and Geron may be worth it, but Shawn Lavaou is not worth giving another season.
@jpodhoretz Not ideal, but when taken out of context and passed along as the only point to the phrase...yeah.
@DLoesch Things have gotten so much better in this state (Still far to go) that I had forgotten about that guy.
@RepJoeKennedy Yup! Now maybe they'll elect people in Puerto Rico who aren't corrupt, who will not impede the Federal assistance that was given them by stashing relief supplies sent to help them. Maybe, they will elect local candidates looking out for the people,  not themselves! #corruptmayor
@mkhammer Show it? By Gawd I hope you took them in for such delishness!!!
@allahpundit Senate is not in jeopardy. And the chances of Beto winning are slim...Cruz just got a shit ton of money pumped into the state and once Trump starts stumping for him, it's over in Texas.
@David_J_Bier @LizMair I wonder what they would have done to my single mother, who could not miss work, when she'd leave me home at the age of 10 when I was home sick from school? Keep in mind, she worked a whole 1 mile from our house.
@secupp @BarackObama @realDonaldTrump Because he was weak and feckless. He drew a line in the sand, and because he lacked the backbone to do something about it, Europe has been swamped with immigrants. I guess it's better than McCain wanting to arm ISIS to fight against Assad?
@ReaganCoalition I just don't get how McCain could get any "burn" to begin with...he leaves this world with some of his final memories being a slime ball like Trump became President, and he couldn't.
@secupp @SenJohnMcCain Huh? He was re-elected in 2016 promising to repeal ACA preying on the fear of his constituents not knowing how much more they'll continue to pay for their health care. He either lied to them, or was petty and vindictive toward Trump.
@allahpundit Meh...McCain died knowing he never became President and that Trump did.
@SenGillibrand OK, not gonna let this stand! This administration sent tons of relief supplies that were not properly distributed by the corrupt leaders in charge down there!
@SethAMandel PooP is my favorite palindrome.
@baltimoresun Meh...we're in a world where a President can cause divide, pitting everyone who disagrees with them as the enemy, as Obama did for 8 years with the GOP. That bred another one who is taking it to a whole new level because he is less tactful than his predecessor. Civility is dead.
@heterochromance @jonkarl @SenJohnMcCain Well yeah, you were being obtuse so I made sure to get your attention to wake you up. Whether it was intentionally obtuse or you just can't see what's right in front of you is not my problem. But open your eyes if you think this is all on Trump. The media is playing you.
@Acosta So after your tantrums all day, you get what you want. And the news here is?
@heterochromance @jonkarl @SenJohnMcCain Pay attention.  The media has learned they can get good air time by either, a.) Asking a question then making it news that he won't answer or b.) illiciting an answer that will help them get the headlines they seek. He didn't play their game today. Asking 45 times is foolish.
@jonkarl @SenJohnMcCain You aren't owed anything! Stop being a little baby because you didn't get your way!
@john_keim Weren't some of his more successful runs with a TE lined up as a FB last week?
@jonkarl This is why the masses hate people like you. He didn't answer you, he won't answer you, but you believe it's your right, that he's obligated by some moral code, to answer you. Trump is an asshole, shouldn't have raised the flag, should acknowledge McCain, but he doesn't owe you!
@allahpundit I always say, Obama was so much more tactful with his pettiness and corruption than Trump.
@SykesCharlie @allahpundit Trump called his wife a C**T?
@Olsonjam808 @Rocofagi1 @Cernovich Haha! This was not meant to disprove what I was saying was it? 		McCain on Obamacare 2016 during his re-election.		https://t.co/pIAFkbiyxP
@Cernovich Because they love that he stuck it to Trump by not voting to repeal ACA. What kind of man runs for re-election saying they will repeal repeal repeal, then because of a petty vendetta, when given the opportunity, flies across country against medical advice, to vote no to repeal?
@SenatorDurbin No community should have too suffer from such gun violence? Where have you been over the great Rahm Emmanuel's tenure in Chid=cago where there has been 4000 murders?
@CatoInstitute Well, as Obama proved...taxing more while spending more drives up the deficit in record numbers.
@jbarro @LizMair Bread buttered? Tennis existed long before her, and will continue long after she is gone. It's called tradition.
@MeghanMcCain @SenJohnMcCain Meghan McCain, you have my deepest remorse.
@TucsonStar @hughhewitt Hero status was lost the moment he called his wife a C**T. You can look past the physical altercations in the Senate, the berating of staff and reporters in the Capital, and the Keating 5 fiasco...but calling wife something so vile in public for other to witness? Unconscionable.
@FranTownsend @SenJohnMcCain Ha! You mean the same John McCain who called his wife a C**T?
@BGObsession Bt that's not saying much...those coaches were mediocre in the tenures, too. Although I think Gibbs would have been competing for a SB had ST not been killed. Gauge this argument by a winning team to see how those coaches played their starters in game 3 of the pre-season.
@BGObsession 0-4 season openers suggest otherwise. One of those loses prevented a playoff appearance.
@trish_regan Yes, it's great! We were able to get 2 of our 3 fed this way. But shaming mothers who cannot breast feed is no way to go about promoting this either. Glad my wife didn't give up on it w our 2nd &amp; 3rd kids, because she was incapable with our 1st and was shamed for it.
@BillOReilly Nope! They should be made aware of his pettiness, his vindictiveness, and his abuse. The man called his own wife a C*NT!!!
@stephenfhayes He's right. McCain has spent 50 years since his imprisonment in Viet Nam, being a nasty, vindictive, petty, and abusive man. He called his own wife a C*NT!!!
@MrChickSports Results? Bottom line at end of game? Or how our starters played in the one pre-season game that should show their progress? 3rd game usually best indicator of how team is doing in pre-season, our 3rd game looked putrid. Looks like another season opening loss by a Gruden team.
@Kelly__Decker @Acosta Haha! Were you voted drama queen in high school?
@Kelly__Decker @Acosta May that father rot in hell! BUT!!! Apples/Oranges. We couldn't stop father, we could've stopped the ILLEGAL ALIEN who killed Tibbets. If he's not in this country, he could NOT have killed her. Had those kids not entered the country illegally, they would NOT have been separated.
@yashar @JaniceDean Never heard about his verbal abuse of staff, and others at the Capital throughout his career? He's petty and betrayed the people who put him in power because of his resentment toward Trump. That is reprehensible and I am happy he will never see the chambers of congress again!
@DailyCaller I found that rather amusing.
@Acosta Same time Mollie Tibbet's parents get to hug her again?
@SenGillibrand Why is everything discriminatory with you? #lifeisnotfair
@CatoInstitute Because it doesn't fit the narrative that Capitalism is evil.
@HillaryClinton I would love her to disappear! Better?
@SenFeinstein You not wanting to protect our children in sickening. I'd say I can't wait till you lose you election, but then who would we be left with?
@byrdinator Meanwhile, the DNC will wisp aside the corruption of the Clintons, the Obamas, and the various other democrats who continue to wrap their tentacles around the power structure in DC.
@baltimoresun So what they're saying is...the historic value of these buildings is not worth the technology available to bore under them to create a bigger, underground channel, instead we're just gonna tear them down. OK, we understand. Just don't tell us this is the only option available.
@boredemployee2 @SenatorDurbin Autocorrect is not my friend. Thanks for taking the time to correct my grammar! You've made a valid argument against my assertion!
@Mitchrick @SenatorDurbin The discussion is about arming a few teachers who have been trained, not some Joe Schmoe teacher who doesn't want, nor has ever handled a gun. Common sense is lost!
@SenatorDurbin You're institution has armed guards, why not schools? Are you more important than our school children?
@HillaryClinton You're going to talk about separation of children from their families while the wound of Mollie Tibbets being ripped from her parents PERMANENTLY, is fresh. Just slip away into oblivion...you lost because you're a horrible person. #dontsendgoonstokillmeplease
@timkaine What about your running mate in 16? Any checks and balances on her criminal actions...lying to congress being the most obvious.
@ComfortablySmug You mean we could have had more globalism?
@SenGillibrand What about Hilary? Is she above the law?
@OutnumberedFNC I don't care...and wonder why you waste your time with it.
@soledadobrien I'm just curious Soledad, did you do your due diligence and call the school to verify, I mean you are a journalist. Or are you going to go by the word of a known liar, Shaun King. yeah, we see a video, but is there verification?
@ShannonBream @instagram You mean like this? https://t.co/CgC3ONwZHO
@jaketapper Glad I stuck with it. The 4th episode got me to stick it out..."Ripe". I just cannot imagine a mother ripping a young woman's heart from her chest, like Camille's.
@SethAMandel Amazing the over, inflated expectations of kids these days. And anyone who challenges my statement "KIDS" do not understand the circle of human life.
@TeamKhabib Be prepared, asshat Connor MacGregor will attempt to steal your wig off your head to make you angry. He destroyed Jose Aldo because he got in his head. Destroy that piece of trash!
@Chickenwench @jwill7804 @TIME Haha! Of course she's going to deny adultery! #butshesohonest
@IngrahamAngle @LifeZette This is not outrageous. I cannot tell you the last time I was interested in monday Night Football, much less any pre-game stuff like analysis or the anthem on TV.
@Chickenwench @jwill7804 @TIME https://t.co/tvT25fJtZp
@yashar @RitaPanahi HOLY CRAP! 100 whole cases of measles!!!!   How many cases were there a year before the anti-vax movement? A quick CDC search shows that there were 301 cases of measles in 1995. But 101 so far in 2018 is an epidemic!!!!!
@allahpundit But but...her press released a statement saying it's not their policy to ban the media, and it won't happen again.
@Chickenwench @TIME SHE ADMITTED IT!
@jwill7804 @Chickenwench @TIME I've been called worse...but NEVER adulterer! NEVER cheated on my spouse...like that adulterer Miranda Lambert!
@Chickenwench @TIME You win...she should be sainted tomorrow! All hail adulterer Miranda Lambert!
@Chickenwench @TIME Hi Mrs. JB. I have never seen a Time article on twitter quoting Blake saying his career was based on honesty, or I would probably say the same about him. ANY PERSON WHO CHEATS ON THEIR WIFE/HUSBAND is dishonest by nature!!!! FFS people are stupid!
@scopesotoscope @DailyCaller Like I said, I don't like Trump enough to continue this with someone I don't even know. The racist card was NEVER played until he put an R next to his name and won the GOP nomination. Doesn't matter what R was GOP nominee or President, you'd still call him a racist.
@MusicIsMedicin1 @TIME Now I am a woman basher because I show the hypocrisy of this woman? You're an idiot!
@MusicIsMedicin1 @TIME Once again, you assume things about me that aren't true. You're making a fool out of yourself.
@scopesotoscope @DailyCaller Yeah, we've heard your rhetoric before. I don't know the man, I don't really like what I've seen, but he put an R next to his name then won the GOP primary, his years of philanthropy in Harlem &amp; other black communities in NYC are ignored...now he's racist. #shitisthick
@MusicIsMedicin1 @TIME Kinda dumb, aren't you? Either that, or you don't take the sanctity of marriage seriously. The mere fact she cheated on her husband is dishonest. She claims her career is built on honesty. The lie is that she built her career on honesty when she screwed another man while married!
@scopesotoscope @DailyCaller You're argument has no merit. He didn't question blacks! It was one man who still hasn't provided actual birth certificate...I'm not saying Obama isn't American so don't try it. And he was talking about Mexican Rapists and Drug dealers not all Mexicans! #suckerborneveryminute
@scopesotoscope @DailyCaller Racists attacks against Obama? Do tell! You throw that racist word around effortlessly. Don't agree with his politics? RACIST!!! Trump is a bull in a china shop. I'd prefer someone as effective, yet more polished....but racist? That's BS!
@MusicIsMedicin1 @TIME OK...follow closely, she committed adultery. That's dishonest. Are you obtuse? As for men doing it, it's EQUALLY dishonest!!!!!!!! But those "cheaters" you claim I am following are not going out in public talking about how honest they are, she is!!!
@MusicIsMedicin1 @TIME She claims her honesty is valued, I say she "cheated" on her husband. That's not honest! So what if he did it, too...she still cheated. It's dishonest. It goes against her claim. 2 wrongs don't make a right, and when you take vow, you honor it. Don't cheat! #dishonest
@scopesotoscope @DailyCaller Inference is Trump voters are racist. It's pretty clear. Lemon has complained for 18 months about multiple Trumpisms, but this is the 1st time he's stated it doesn't matter. There are others making the same claim. Sudden realization? No...clear attempt to paint right as racist.
@TIME While she cheated on her husband?
@MikeGiardi No Malcolm, you're not listening.
@scopesotoscope @DailyCaller But Lemon is inferring as such with his comments. He is trying to divide. He is loathsome!
@secupp But...you know as well as I do there are so many who are lying, using deceit to unseat that "one" person, which is an attack on the millions in this country who voted for him. They are the enemy!! FFS, it's real simple!
@CatoInstitute Obama quietly rids the federal government of conservative leaders, not a word is said. Trump rids the government of one perjurer, and it's the apocalypse.
@DailyCaller Because they are pushing hard to paint all of his supporters as racist!
@MrChickSports Yeah, this was pretty poor of him to put her through that...now what is she to expect for the rest of the marriage?
@KirstenPowers @CNNTonight @donlemon So much respect for you, I just don't see how you can give that man your time.
@Timodc @SethAMandel We hoped for that "will this be the moment" for Obama's corruption for years. Hope on!
@KurtSchlichter Obama ate dog.
@MarkCorallo1 @QuinHillyer Right, because he put America first, and his actions were almost entirely respectful. Bush 1 did NOT put USA first, Clinton certainly didn't put America first and his actions nearly tore us apart. Bush II did NOT put USA 1st. Obama did not put America 1st! Trump is callous.
@RyanTAnd You'll figure it out along the way like the rest of us. CONGRATULATIONS!!!!
@BreitbartNews Meanwhile, people will look back on Stelter and think...who the **** is he?
@bethanyshondark You're just now figuring that out?
@KyleKashuv I'm young, smart, have been given a great platform to succeed in life, I shred Hoggs, but my ego is getting a little too big for my britches.
@jaketapper @bethanyshondark I don't know where you've been to think this is not the norm with them, but I've seen it before in person! They are the most violent protest group in this country and need to be recognized by you and your ilk, as such.
@czabe You're guilty of it, too.
@bigbiren @FrankLuntz 3 kids in 4 years...get yer facts straight.
@TomFitton @realDonaldTrump Time has come, as their boss Trump should fire the first person in the line who refuses to provide what he demands. Next person in line...then if they defy order, fire them...next in line. And so on and so forth!
@MeetThePress @realDonaldTrump @KimberlyEAtkins Sure, take law advice from Chuck Todd over a celebrated prosecutor, and one of the most respected criminal defense attorney's in country's history. It's simple Chuck, Trump says, "I didn't chew cud", but Mueller has 3 people willing to lie and say he did, Boom! Perjury charge.
@SenKamalaHarris You won't vote for him anyway!
@FrankLuntz I don't sleep with a phone, tablet, or any other communication device in my room...ever.
@Sammyjkramer @NPR You are dense, aren't you? Follow the argument...anyone with a brain would know I was being facetious to make a point, but you must lack comprehension skills since you're still stuck on that.
@Sammyjkramer @NPR Look it up is all you got? You are misrepresenting the truth, dishonest...lying. You have no valid rebuttal so you tell me to take a nap? Excellent skills! How much does NPR pay you? Haha! They're getting ripped off.
@SenFeinstein 99% of his records unseen? Is that a not enough characters on twitter mishap, or are you lying? Because he was on the bench for longer than his time in the White House with sufficient records of his court room decisions! That would be more than half his records, at least!
@SenSchumer You make the claim every day with no proof, just innuendo! You can say it 1000 times, but it still doesn't make you correct.
@Sammyjkramer @NPR Only quoting part of my tweet to fit your outcry is equally as dishonest as the your 1st tweet. Point is, he's not eliminating ALL chain migration, just limit it. You make it sound like he's killing it entirely so he looks like hypocrite...which is a lie! You're a liar!
@NPR Chain migration has been a target of Trump, but be honest...not the entire chain! He just wants it limited, to be immediate family, not uncle's son by marriage 3 times removed!!!
@stephenfhayes But Hilary already tried!
@SenFeinstein @UCSUSA @kenkimmell Just so you guys know...the US was once again the leader in the world for lowest emissions!
@ByMikeJones Just like I replied to those enamored by Barkley's first run...		Pre-season!
@ralbrtn @UnfilteredSE @secupp @andylevy @BasilSmikleJr @chriscquinn @IngrahamAngle Kinda why I suggested it...
@GayPatriot Just like Baltimore is a shit hole city!
@JayGlazer Pre-season against the Browns.
@UnfilteredSE @secupp @andylevy @BasilSmikleJr @chriscquinn Invite her on your show for a head's up discussion about this.
@SenSchumer You won't vote for him either way!
@SenatorDurbin Who cares what you think? You won't vote for him one way or the other so it doesn't matter. The GOP has the 50 votes needed.
@bigbiren @UnfilteredSE @brianstelter @secupp I agree there is a lot of nonsense on that Network, but Stelter is easily the worst!
@UnfilteredSE @brianstelter @secupp While I find Alex Jones laughable, at best...the fact you're discussing "fake news" with the single biggest perpetrator of fake news on your network tells us all we really need to know.
@arielhelwani Get Dana White to sign that guy to a fight with @dc_mma immediately, exploit the Blue Star of his former team, and put the fix in for him to be the HW World Champ! That'll get the ratings! #ufciscorrupt
@jaketapper It's not reasonable for you to demand Trump do anything. He has repeatedly said meddling was wrong and measures are being taken to stop it in the future. He has denounced it repeatedly. You just want to belabor the point for ratings! Shame on you!
@UnfilteredSE @secupp I know you're a never trumpet, but give us a break. The idea that the media does not seek to divide is preposterous! The MSM has become Jerry Springer time!
@dc_mma @MightyMouseUFC The Class of the UFC, gets robbed of his belt cause he wouldn't move up a class to become another 2 belt champ, so they give it to the guy who would. UFC is becoming a JOKE! #thefixisin #ufcworsethanboxing #ufccorrupt
@MightyMouseUFC @Zevia @MetroPCS @ORIGINPC @HenryCejudo You deserve better than to be robbed of belt so they can set up another dual class fighter vying for 2 Championship belts. And you remain the class of the UFC, while they go out and sign a criminal to the biggest UFC money fight ever. 	UFC = Boxing in the 60's &amp; 70's. #fixisin
@arielhelwani After seeing MacGregor gets another UFC payday after tantrum, I had about given up hope the integrity of the UFC. Then, when UFC gave Cejudo the fight, it became apparent why...they want the hype of another 2 class champ. #ufcisfixed #justascorruptasboxing #whereisdonking
@hunterw @realDonaldTrump OK, so he changed his tune. Why is this significant? If someone attacked you, suggesting you were the problem with America, you'd get defensive, too.
@DailyCaller This isn't real, is it? Did they really suggest they deserve SS details?
@donlemon And you're right, James is not as dumb as Obama...who locked thousands of kids on the border while President.
@donlemon You are insignificant.
@allahpundit Trump is far more popular than Lebron James. And while I myself am caught up in the Jordan is a gambler, smoker and philanderer, while James is seeming saint like, but Mike is more likable attitude, it still doesn't change the fact that Trump is more popular than James.
@FrankLuntz OK, usually your posts are pithy and relevant, but what does it matter if the teenager was US citizen, or from Cambodia, fact remains he attempted to come across the Mexican border where these drugs were easy to access.
@allahpundit Isn't it the DNC narrative for 18, 20, and as long as they think it works?
@DailyCaller Well...he'd know best about those traits, possessing them himself.
@stephenasmith Most don't...including me, but 2 Super Bowl MVP's and the big brother Peyton will assuredly get him a first ballot entry.
@allahpundit I mean, I can follow the logic, but only so far. If he was trying to throw the 2018 elections to blame Congress, he would be Barak Obama.
@TheJuanWilliams Remaining supporters? Oh Juan, you sure do know how to mince words. His approval ratings are higher than at anytime.
@RadioFreeTom Problem is Mr. Nichols, a large portion of the press pool at the WH are not journalists, they are agents of the far left out to try to find anything to take down this President. Are those Maxine called to harass, deserving? Is that a better analogy?
@ClayTravis @JamesOKeefeIII He'll just trot out the golden boy, Tim Tebow, to talk about how great Urban is/was.
@JudgeJeanine Woohoo! Except that Costco is in Lake Park, not PBG. ;)
@SenSchumer Well, here in MD our gov took the bull by the horns &amp; started funding massive infrastructure jobs in the state. He sent survey teams to inspect bridges and roads in the state, determined the priority of repair, and has been fixing this state's roads and bridges since elected.
@UnfilteredSE @secupp Any mention of Maxine?
@LATSeema Well then, what is your job? Because Jim Acosta, along with CNN and MSNBC, are not providing journalism anymore, they are a tool of the left. They are actively seeking to insert themselves into advancing the leftist cause. And people are tired of it!
@SenFeinstein She never sat on a bench with which to display how she'd rule. He has a lengthy record from the bench to judge your vote. But let's be real, no matter what you know or don't know about him, you would NEVER vote for him anyway, so why bother?
@rosemcgowan Justified violence does.
@Acosta You're right, the "press" is not the enemy. However, you can't hide behind that moniker. You are not the press, you are an agent of the left and your petty tactics have become so contemptible that people just don't like you. You can't even see that because your ego is in the way!
@SenSchumer @SenateGOP Haha! They're not "hiding" anything, they're just not releasing anything you want to spite you! Sound familiar? It should...it was an Obama tactic for 8 years.
@MeghanMcCain Gross and pathetic is what your father did...all those years promising to repeal and replace, only to vote no to repeal because of his petty vendetta against Trump. I know you don't like to hear this, but your father has a terrible record of bullying in DC. He is petty .
@LarrySabato Come on Larry, they're fed up with seeing like-minded individuals attacked viciously because people like Jim Acosta and his rhetoric, lies, and BS. His dishonesty should be exposed. You see @ShannonBream have to go inside the studio when trying to cover SC nominee revealed?
@DavidRutz @benshapiro Triggered? Haha!
@DailyCaller What did she call Obama sending Lois Lerner's IRS after conservative journalists?
@CatoInstitute Innovation...more importantly, the vehicle with which to nurture innovation. CAPITALISM!!!
@NGivasDC @DailyCaller @JoeNBC @POTUS @realDonaldTrump So Google is the arbiter of honesty in all things political?
@LaurelPatch So now we're judging schools on how many make it to these Ivy League schools? With prices of these schools, many of the smartest students know that undergrad degrees are less important than graduate degrees, so they don't waste money on these big schools.
@BreitbartNews And in 100 years it happens thanks to policies the French, Germans, and Brits have all adopted. The only hope for Christianity on that continent is in countries like Poland, perhaps Italy will be saved, but the majority of Western Europe is going to be Islamic within 100 years.
@JamilSmith @joshuamckerrow @WesleyLowery @kimbriellwapo @dataeditor Have anything to do with the lack of witness cooperation?
@SenFeinstein Demand the DOJ turn over documents your Congress requested legally!
@SenFeinstein Where is your outrage over the documents the Congress has subpoenaed from the DOJ? You should be livid!
@KinraIce @SenGillibrand @kyrstensinema Dubious claims? Haha! https://t.co/2Ap8hS3raR
@FrankLuntz @FBI They've been looking for a location. It was rumored to be here in MD.
@jpodhoretz @hughhewitt And maintain a narrow majority in the house.
@jpodhoretz I think Deadwood was great, but the Wire and Breaking Bad were both better written. Not sure about the Sopranos, some of the story lines went whoever they wanted to go...kinda like they didn't care because they were so successful.
@bethanyshondark Unprofessional way the President deals with the media? FFS! The overwhelming majority of media outlets have been trying to take him down once he won the GOP nomination! Talk about unprofessional...have you ever watched Ana Navarro?
@DRUDGE_REPORT If you're going to do something like this, you have to bring more security. This guy could have gotten his team of one security detail killed out there.
@JessicaTarlov @BetoORourke He is not a threat. Cruz will cruise to victory.
@DailyCaller Meanwhile, the impossible has happened! The GDP is over 4%, although you said it would never happen again! Great day for the USA!!!
@SenGillibrand Meanwhile, the impossible happened! GDP over 4%. Obama and your girl Hilary said it would never happen again. Well, left to they devices, it would not have happened! Trump is a buffoon, but it's a great day for the USA!!!
@NRO Bottled water, too?
@jimsciutto Yup, and now we know better.
@KimStrassel As long as she doesn't promise her constituents one thing, then cast them aside for a petty difference with the President.
@jpodhoretz I was wondering why the soap opera was becoming extinct...then I remembered the drama of today's news cycle.
@jpodhoretz What changed? Umm...it was discovered he taped conversations with a client without client's knowledge?
@MeetThePress It can be, but not ideologues hell bent on taking the current President down.
@DLoesch But but but....that's misogynist!
@SenWhitehouse @TheJusticeDept FLAT OUT LIE Senator!
@ShannonBream But but but...summers there are soooooooo hot!
@seanmdav But, but, but close Clinton aides said so!
@politico While Dfana Linzer at MSNBC just posted this lie, and still has not retracted it. 		"The attorney general of the united states just joined a chant of "lock her up" at an event in DC."		But yeah, what we are seeing is true?
@DailyCaller Then let's close down the bases in Germany, and put them in Poland, who is willing to pay us.
@DailyCaller I wonder what dirt she can sling at Gavin Newsom
@RealJamesWoods @Walmart I hope you tipped them 50 bucks you cheap bastard!
@drew_lofton I think someone should slap you. Not me, of course, I am a loving guy.
@FrankLuntz Who was polled?
@GayPatriot Is she wearing a moo-moo?
@CatoInstitute Thank you Capitalism!
@johncardillo @jpodhoretz Haha! I think he was wrong for saying it, but he is not an unhinged leftist.
@SuzanneElizabe @KatiePavlich You watch your mouth!
@politico Right, there not used to a US President putting Americas interests first, instead of the New World Order.
@FrankLuntz @onetoughnerd OK, I want your honest opinion. What was the single most significant event, person, group that divided Americans so deeply? There have been divisions before in my lifetime, but nothing like this. Your opinion...what is the origin?
@ShannonBream It's because you went to FSU. I get that all that time.
@JonahNRO Have you tried Goliath on Amazon with Billy Bob Thornton? First season was pretty good, second season was not as good.
@LarrySabato Come on, Larry! Now you're picking nits! Jackie Onasis was a dishonest woman, who helped hide her husband's transgressions. The Kennedys were as bad as the Trumps.
@JessicaTarlov @AmericaNewsroom @JMfreespeech @kayleighmcenany @FoxNews Better than ever? Were you getting training for spying on GOP in Russia?
@wesgeorgia951 @RepMikeRogers @marcthiessen You do realize that your argument is fallacy?
@bethanyshondark @MeghanMcCain She's just defending her father, and parroting him because Trump blasted him and almost cost McCain re-election. If her father and Trump got along, she'd be kissing his ass.
@marcthiessen "The attacks on Benghazi were a result of a video from a college student here in the US!" They had intel proving this false before the claim was made! But he had a re-election to win.
@allahpundit You know for a fact that Putin is experiencing no repercussions from his actions? None of his flunkies have been expelled from the US, no Russian assets seized? You know that Putin pulled much of his holdings in the US out before summit? How much did that set him back $$$?
@wesgeorgia951 @RepMikeRogers @marcthiessen Yes, because saluting an adversary makes you look more stupid than bowing. Get outta here with that nonsense...nice try!
@RepMikeRogers @marcthiessen None of it was as bad as Obama full on bowing before international leaders...not remotely as damaging to the international position of the USA. In fact, I do not think there has ever been a more damaging display than Obama going around the world apologizing for America.
@CoryBooker Like you have been doing since you got into the Senate? First kissing the ring of harry Reid, now Chuck Schemer. Think for yourself, man! When in NJ you were sane.
@PFF @BurgundyBurner Now...if they can stop the run, maybe we can get somewhere.
@politico He attacked Conservative publications consistently! He's such a hypocrite!
@derekahunter So the image in the Oval Office of Butina is not who they say it is, yet it continues to make the rounds as factual?
@guypbenson "The attack on our consulate was a result of the outrage from a cartoon of Muhamed!"
@DLoesch It was a spontaneous attack as a result of that terrible student who created a cartoon of Muhamed!  ******sarcasm alert******
@benshapiro He was the prime culprit of "making stuff up"!!!!!!!!
@SenGillibrand @realDonaldTrump How do you know he refused to stand up to Putin? Were you there when they met in private?
@JessicaTarlov @KatiePavlich If you really believe that, you're not as smart as I think you are. This is a sales tactic used to develop leverage. You're a decent pundit, but you need to learn sales before continuing to misunderstand this man's tactics. Yeah...dishonest, but he's a good used car salesman.
@JeffFlake Nice spin! Can't wait til you disappear into anonymity.
@SenSchumer @realDonaldTrump A single, ominous question now hangs over the White House: what could possibly cause Obama to put the interests of Iranian Terrorists over those of the United States?
@SenSchumer @realDonaldTrump You mean like giving the #1 State sponsor of terrorism a truck load of US dollars...BILLIONS!!!!
@allahpundit Well, she is the face of the party...looking stupid instead of saying I don't know makes for fodder for  her opposition.
@allahpundit Reminds me of the the apology tour Obama took before even being elected in 2008.
@oliverdarcy @allahpundit I would say handing over billions in cash to the #1 sponsor of terror, the one nation with more American blood on their hands than any other nation in the last 30 years is tantamount to the most disgraceful performance of any US President.
@JonahNRO Well, the Obama Diplomacy worked so well, so we should ignore it?
@xan_desanctis @allahpundit Nope! Romney called Russia #1 geo-political threat ...Obama laughed, shrugged it off and let Russia annex Crimea. Today? I still KNOW Putin is a monster! However, a leftist talking point, DIPLOMACY is being employed and you suggest acceptance of diplomacy makes the right trash.
@jaketapper Well Jake, didn't Obama go around the world during his first Presidential race... apologizing for America?
@ByronYork @IngrahamAngle Yeah, considering the last time he faced a SCOTUS nominee, he was embarrassed by his lack of knowledge about the law.
@jpodhoretz I had my first gun at age 5.
@MatthewBetley @KurtSchlichter You can have all 42 of my followers!
@brianstelter You're a prime example of CNN's failure, you &amp; Acosta feel so entitled, you can't get out of your ego's way! And you wonder why you do not get the audience you so crave! Ride the Trump hate while you can, once out of office, you'll be out of a job. You're last 3 fans will leave.
@Peter_Wehner France was the better team. Croatia had a much longer, more grueling path and it began to show...but France played tougher competition to get to the finals, and beat them all. And I was rooting for the Croatians\.
@jaketapper You mean a hack trying to make a statement by asking a loaded question? Come on Jake, you're about the only one left on CNN with a modicum of respect for the craft, even though you have your doozies...the rest just want to steer the narrative toward their ends, only.
@DonaldJTrumpJr Every time I want to ask you to let your father do all the talking, you deliver one of these. Kudos!
@TandlerNBCS This would be a call to Gruden and the run game more than a call to Alex Smith to step up.
@nytimes If you're not bitten by a tick!
@GuyVerhoftwat Tens of thousands? Looks like barely 2k.
@safeagain1 @KirstenPowers @realDonaldTrump @CNN @donlemon He is not saying the media is the enemy of the people, he is saying elements are, and they are! Where were you when Obama was calling the GOP the enemy? That sort of rhetoric catapulted this battle, and a complicit media that helped him!
@matthewamiller @johnrobertsFox But CNN is a joke, they are not taken seriously by the American public anymore. It's a shame to see a couple of the quality people at CNN waste their careers away.
@cspan @SenSchumer Well...there you go!
@jpodhoretz You believe he will?
@BreitbartNews They used to battle all the time when Sean had him on his show. Sharpton used to get annihilated.
@SenSchumer It didn't matter who he nominated, you would have opposed with all you have. You've turned into the ideologue I thought you were about 25 years ago.
@OANN How about they issue a warning to Neymar for his antics, far more egregious!
@RepVeasey @SenGillibrand Such nonsense! The promise of free stuff from Obama so the DNC has a broader voter base is the real reason. Quit lying.
@pwgphoto That's probably the problem, their parents raised them to shoot at people.
@SethAMandel Valerie Jarret was the real President during Obama's 8 year tenure.
@TomiLahren What you seem to miss, is the government does legislate morality...you know murder and all.
@hammersmithteam Rocky Gorge?
@TomiLahren And on this we'll disagree...forever. The life in the womb needs a voice if the mother is willing to kill them. If she is willing to abort for convenience, then why not just have a hysterectomy. Any woman selfish enough to kill for convenience, shouldn't have a child, anyway.
@SebGorka Not difficult to believe when more and more Christian Pastors preach what they want, feel good Christianity.
@CNBC @LizMair Capitalism is such a great way of life!
@DavidBahnsen @TomiLahren Yeah, because calling her a dingbat in today's political climate will advance your argument. I've disagreed with Lahren about this subject since she first revealed it, but dingbat? Come on, man! This sort of tweet is fodder for the Dems!!!
@SteveBuckhantz @JoeJacoby66HOG @NFL Not sure if he deserves it...he was great, but was beaten often by smaller, quicker defenders. If you tried to engage him, he would destroy you, but LT exposed his flaw and many found they could do the same.
@arielhelwani Nope...the heavy weight class is watered down, no one left to compete. Stipe enjoyed the talentless division for a while.
@arielhelwani Grrrrrreat! Now we get to listen to this loudmouth talk about how great he is...that is until Jon Jones makes him cry again.
@TwitchyTeam It's against his religion.
@KyleKashuv So they are illegally importing guns into Chicago, but they want more laws?
@chicksonright OK, I have a different perspective on this. My mom let me grow my hair like this as a boy. Some woman told my mom I was such a cute little girl, right in from of me. I was horrified! I never had long hair again in my lifetime. I keep my son's hair short to protect him from that.
@SenGillibrand You realize that every day it's the same thing with you? "We must fight..."	How about instead of constantly "fighting", you seek common ground?	And you wonder why this country is so divided! If their leaders are calling for fights every single day, well then what do you expect?
@FrankLuntz While I know it won't happen with this pick, imagine Ginsburg leaves the court, if I were Trump I might blow the Dems minds and nominate Merrick Garland.
@guypbenson @katyperry People talk about how great certain shows were...shows that need special props to become "AMAZING", instead of simply being good music for fans to enjoy. Her show was meh...Prince? That was a great show and he didn't need some giant robot to make the show.
@PrisonPlanet Haha! Close, but the woman who shot dude trying to carjack her car, with her children in the backseat warms my heart just a little more.
@LunchBoxHero_ @pennywise247 @arielhelwani There aren't enough fighters to carry monthly PPV fights, and the pool is getting more and more shallow. It will get to a point where they will only be able to field a PPV 3 or 4 times a year.
@ComfortablySmug Yeah, drives me crazy how people think their images are quality stuff. 		#myimagesrock https://t.co/cp72GW3Ga1
@CatoInstitute Thank you Capitalism!
@KurtSchlichter @townhallcom Leftists here don't realize Mexico the country is not poor, they export more than most European nations. But their people live in squalor because of their government, and the cartels that terrorize, especially towns along the border. Get 'em, w/out permission from the Mexi Gov!
@CatoInstitute However, illegal immigrants are not. I		Also, interviewed after being introduced, many new immigrants spoke about being eligible for welfare, and social security benefits...not what they offer the country.
@diannaESPN @TyrodTaylor Flacco is healthy, he showed what he could do when feeling healthy toward the end of last season, gave his team the chance to win a playoff spot, his defense failed. Tyrod is truth. He will surprise many as will that Browns team. At least 5 games better if Tryod stays healthy.
@ShannonBream I carried 13 credit hours through a summer at FSU, 2-12 week courses and one 6 week course both summer sessions. Luckily all my classes were close enough together to not have to walk too far, and my apt was a block off campus or I would have melted. Worst...summer...ever!!!
@RealJamesWoods Meh...4 years ago it was Kamala Harris and then we found out who she is.
@BreitbartNews As they should be!~
@SenFeinstein Something we can agree on! Happy Independence Day to you!
@FoxNews Amul Thapar
@allahpundit Been hearing this argument for 40 years...not gonna happen.
@DailyCaller @MeghanMcCain I'm from DC, know many who work on the Hill, heard your father's reputation, &amp; can't understand how you think Trump is unforgiveable. Your dad is petty, disrespectful, angry, verbally abusive, and a liar. #keatingfive
@StevenErtelt He's being harassed by his caucus.
@MZHemingway Why would you want her to stop	?
@benshapiro I tried, but she likes princess dresses!
@politico That is not what he said! In context he said he was not "pushing" them, which was reported he'd done behind closed doors! It was a lie. Is he trying to influence them via twitter? Yup! But twist the truth...in other words, QUIT LYING!
@SenFeinstein What did Obama say? Elections have consequences!
@AnnDaughter @CBSNews Umm...she is a "socialist" but appears to be taking advantage of Capitalism. So um yeah...it's news!
@WashTimes Well...he's almost big enough.
@jpodhoretz @philipaklein Disney ruined another great franchise!
@Rachel__Nichols Who cares? They forgave him, he got them a Championship...why would their feelings matter if he leaves for LA...it's friggin LA compared to Cleveland! What about those two cities do you think is more attractive? If he were smart he'd go to Houston where he'd keep more money.
@LaurelPatch So...when I was a kid, we would have 90* for much of July and August, and it was never considered "Major Heat Wave"...when it was over 100 for a period of time we'd call it a "Major Heat Wave"...FFS, it's summer time, 90* weather is the norm, not "armageddon".
@OliverMcGee @ChrisLoesch @MaxineWaters It won't go anywhere, but good for her!
@secupp Oh SE, I like you but you're sadly mistaken...the media is pushing communities apart. People are starting to wake to this fact. Doesn't mean you should fear for your safety, but you're not victims...the people of this shooting are the victims, who just happen to be media.
@SenGillibrand How stupid do you have to be to understand, the gun is not the outrage here! Guns don't kill people...they are inanimate objects, tools of madmen!
@staceydash He's not under federal investigation.
@Tom_Winter @seanmdav @jonathan4ny Apparently he lived in Laurel, MD. Friends who live there are saying the road by his house has been shut down.
@SenFeinstein You and all the other cry baby liberals forget one thing...IT WAS A PRESIDENTIAL RACE!!!		https://t.co/WxNPhsKZWB
@Bree2Land6 Son, you did a better job than you say. The only real time you got burnt, it was a key 3rd down. Then a lucky TD that bounced off helmet of another player into his hands, you had him covered. 3rd time was TD you had him covered like a blanket...great throw by Ben, great catch.
@DailyCaller Will? In many cases they have...just look at Antifa!
@KirstenPowers @AC360 Is he a qualified candidate for the position, or was he wrapped up in the culture of misogyny? I refuse to watch Copper, he's a hack.
@DailyCaller Let's hope so!
@SenSchumer @realDonaldTrump Chuck Schumer, becoming as good as Harry Reid and Nancy Pelosi at misrepresenting the truth...in other words, becoming a master at lying!
@ChrisMurphyCT @maddow @SenateMajLdr So disingenuous! The precedent is about Presidential elections!
@LarrySabato Come on Larry, you think Trump can do worse than a Conservative candidate while Sotomayor sits on the bench?
@jpodhoretz Amal Thapar
@ForecasterEnten @JessicaTarlov Stop! It's the Presidential cycle, not the mid-terms that have been the precedent!
@DLoesch He just doesn't get it!
@guypbenson I'd rather see Trey Gowdy than Mike Lee, although I do like Lee.
@NumbersMuncher We love Jeanine, but she is not qualified. Let's get real about this.
@SenGillibrand Meanwhile, new reports show wages growing at record pace!
@SenGillibrand I don't understand how a woman can destroy the life within them...the life that is not their own! I cannot understand how the baby inside them has no voice!!!!!!!!
@DineshDSouza Get your story straight!!!! They did not harass her at another restaurant, she went home after Red Hen. It was the other family members who were harassed. You want to be taken seriously on your second chance at this...get it right!
@marklevinshow Can someone please explain how Brian Stelter actually has a job in journalism?
@SenFeinstein Again, I ask you to provide us with some sort of support for this blatant lie!!!!
@jpodhoretz Such a finicky business, why would you alienate a large portion of your potential business?
@TheJuanWilliams You used to be so subjective, now you're disingenuous at best. John McLaughlin would be so disappointed in you!
@JoeNBC I keep certain journalists from the opposing point of view so I can have some sort of understanding, but you're so over the top dishonest, it's not worth it.
@CatoInstitute And the overwhelming majority would be willing to give up land to protect them from whats coming across the border!
@jaketapper Right, because you ignored it when Obama did it, but you will say the better conditions today, are barbaric! You lie, Jake...we're tired of your lies.
@mattklewis Then you don't the attack we're under by the left and have been for 50 years. They will stop at practically nothing to gain and maintain power, for power's sake. You aligning with them is tantamount to putting another Sotomayor on the bench or keeping Trump from more Gorsuch's.
@JamilSmith @secupp @maddow Well, I chalk you up to another insincere hack if you think Rachel Maddow is a good journalist.
@maddow So you were crying because you couldn't stomach the lies you were trying to spew?
@JeffFlake You're a border Senator, you know the actual risk inherent with the illegal immigrants, and you side with the left because of your petty disdain for Trump? January 19 can't come soon enough!
@bethanyshondark @nikkihaley Would love to see Pence resign and Nikki run as Trump's VP.
@BetoORourke Haha! What poll is that? We all know you're down double digits in any meaningful polls. You will lose!
@JoeNBC It didn't...that's why they rejected any furtherance of the Obama era!
@LizMair Please train it to stay on a leash.
@SenFeinstein Can you provide a legitimate source that will support your assertion that Trump is ripping babies from their mother's breast?
@SenFeinstein No it didn't, it said there was not enough evidence to definitively prove that assertion, not that it did not exist! LIAR!
@SenFeinstein The report did not say that! Liar!
@RealJamesWoods  https://t.co/xO0EN4JQK8
@MZHemingway @SenatorLeahy I thought to myself, if there was ever an example of why there should be term limits!!!
@TomiLahren  https://t.co/36GrsJKwLb
@BreitbartNews  https://t.co/f5q6qZKNwr
@StevenErtelt I wasn't.
@jaketapper But Jake, you cry he is a dictator, tyrant...yet you want him to possess more power from the executive branch?
@JoeNBC I feel sorry for a narcissist "journalist" who cannot get out of the way of his own ego and disdain for others enough to open his eyes to the truth, who is intentionally lying to his followers.
@JoeNBC And now that word is getting around that their kids will be taken, maybe these ILLEGALS will stop trying to enter the country ILLEGALLY!
@KurtSchlichter How did Gellibrand feel when Obama was putting them in cages?
@secupp @GOP Obama did it in the DNC for 10 years!
@CatoInstitute Now...maybe she can go back to her country after been given a free education and make her own country better.
@staceydash Thus, the Republic and not a democracy!
@KirstenPowers Going to a baseball game with Raul Castro is historic!
@KatiePavlich Meh...he knows there is no more Dlue Dog in the DNC and sees the current party as extreme...he is more in line with RINO's than today's DNC anyway.
@TandlerNBCS 2 really great stories in DC Sports today!
@RubinReport @KyleKashuv Hi I'm Brian and I am a Conservative Christian who drinks coffee at Starbucks! Oh and I believe you can live however you want to live your life!
@timkaine Haha! Your lies about your candidate have begun the second you find out who your running against.
@BreitbartNews I hope so!
@JoeNBC Obama said it half-heartedly once in 14 years of public office we knew him, why should this administration be held to a higher standard?
@SohrabAhmari Why? Did Trump fly North Korean officials stacks of cash in the billions?
@politico Because they are eating the spoonfuls of crap the Democratic party is feeding them.
@GibFulton @SenGillibrand Righteous Dems? This tweet from Kirsten is a huge lie, and you talk about Dems being righteous?
@ArthurSchwartz @DailySignal So by the laws of distributive property, Mike Pompeo said it. Therefore Mike Pompeo thinks Trudeau should go to hell! 		***saracsm alert***
@john_keim Snyder won't pay attention...as long as the profits in DC stay as large as they are for the Redskins, nothing changes to suggest we'll win a Super Bowl. Maybe over on the Wizards side of things, the Nats...Snyder doesn't care enough about anything but the bottom line.
@JoeNBC You're a drama queen!
@JoeNBC "Savage working class?" You're a drama queen!
@JoeNBC Speak for yourself! We're tired of these nations trying to pull us into a global society that does not benefit me or John Q. Public in North Platte, Nebraska. Let them have their One World Order!
@CHICKatNBCS I remember when I got back to DC area from Florida after living there 12 years, I saw you over at Congressional for a tournament and mentioned it was nice to see you still around. You've always been one of my favorites, Chick! Good luck on your next adventure!
@KiyomiTaguchi @BurgundyBurner Those concrete blocks didn't save her, momentum would have flipped that truck over them and crushed her. She was lucky the full impact was into the post, then distributed through those blocks.
@sane_democrat @1PardonMyFrench @FoxBusiness @NancyPelosi NOOOOOOOOO! She is the best thing to happen to the GOP in a generation!
@TandlerNBCS Red... who?
@mkhammer You and he are 2 of my favorites!
@FrankLuntz He has no business going on any show, no investigator should.
@JoeNBC Throwing more excrement at the wall to see what will stick instead of real journalism, I see!
@TedLeonsis Congratulations, Ted!
@ArthurSchwartz @KurtSchlichter When Putin has them paying 15 bucks a gallon for gas, then we'll see how they think they can live without us.
@AndrewCMcCarthy @NRO If he can give you a straight line to Obama, convincingly...no wiggle room, you give him immunity.
@jpodhoretz But you did, right?
@The_Tyler_Grant @KyleKashuv Problem is he didn't "report" he inferred...it is not his job to present theories.
@MeghanMcCain No people hate Washington because politicians renege on promises...like saying you'll do everything you can to get ACA repealed in order to get elected, you get elected, then you vote NOT to repeal because your petty disdain for the President is more important than constituents.
@BreitbartNews He claims "we're" not listening! He is the one who is not listening! We don't care about his "social justice", just play what you're paid to play. Be a social justice warrior on your own time!
@ByMikeJones @USATODAY He's not listening, we don't want to see his "social justice" disrespecting the men and women who died protecting our flag, our country, our freedoms! Play football and be a social justice warrior on your own time! That's how it's done in 90% of the real world!
@ReaganCoalition Well then, he can thank Obama for that! I mean, Trump is President as a referendum against Obama.
@TeamCoco "Technically speaking, Queen Elizabeth is the Sovereign of the parliamentary democracy and constitutional monarchy of Canada."
@MalcolmJenkins No! You aren't listening! We don't want to see you disrespect the National Anthem! Do your social cause somewhere else and just play the game you're paid to play. If you want to be paid to be a social justice warrior, then go do it. If you're in the NFL shut up and play!
@JoeNBC Technically speaking, Queen Elizabeth is the Sovereign of the parliamentary democracy and constitutional monarchy of Canada. Unless you frequently use Canadian money or are particularly savvy with regard to Canadian politics, you may not have known they had any kind of monarchy.
@SenFeinstein Give us some examples...your word has been tainted by your many lies on Twitter, so you need to start backing up your fiction with clear data!
@FrankLuntz Frank, I loved your reply to the Democratic strategist at the end of the segment last night. So refreshing seeing someone called out for their blatant fiction!
@john_keim So he slips coming out of the break...hmm.
@barrysvrluga Thank you!
@DailyCaller They even blasted media darling Tom Brady!
@KateBennett_DC @jaketapper @FLOTUS Yeah but Fromm inferred she was beaten by Trump, and Stelter went off into wild conspiracy theory as well with NOTHING, absolutely nothing to substantiate either. Just because there may be an honest one or 2 of you around, doesn't mean there is not #fakenews being perpetrated.
@SenSchumer They're not going up because of Trump...they were going up the moment ACA was signed into law, thanks Chuck!
@jaketapper So let me get this straight, the NFL players will not honor commitment to children in the DC area because they disagree with the President's decision to deny 4 or 5 Eagles access to the White House? I see, let's chop off our noses to spite our face!
@PattyMurray @timkaine You going to do the same thing for mothers who go to jail for say...robbery, murder, or even tax evasion?
@SenFeinstein Ha! No plan? You sure don't pay attention...or you're lying!
@jpodhoretz you're complaint because streaming sites like Amazon and netflix releases the whole series at once? Dude, show some discipline and watch a few of them, one a week like you prefer!
@ChrisLoesch She is so blind from her own arrogance! She must've forgotten Elian Gonzalez! https://t.co/k6531ND44B
@JoeNBC You mean like those mothers at the border who think they can cross illegally, so their children are taken away from them?
@BGObsession As an O's fan, it drives me nuts!
@KurtSchlichter While it wasn't his "parents"...does she not remember Elian Gonzalez?
@NBCSRedskins I know this is supposed to be about Derrius Guice, but I have to ask why the Skins are using an obstacle that has their RB's lowering their head with the new policy that affects RB's leading with their heads?
@JaniceDean Who cares? As long as I get one!
@SenSchumer Haha! Now you're worried about a strong economy? #hypocrite
@jpodhoretz Yeah, I think he got a raw deal, even though he committed the crime, but he's not a savory character to begin with. No need for Trump to pardon him, he's doing just fine since he served his term.
@M7Aaron Not that I don't like Manusky, just don't think he's innovative enough...Gruden needs a defense that is lights out if he is going to win a SB! SB winning head coaches know how to manage the clock in the 4th Q of games. I don't think Gruden is smart enough.
@jpodhoretz They're pumping in a lot, and posting some seriously bogus poll results.
@timkaine Terrible health care access that does not give good care! I'll take it!
@jpodhoretz John, i gotta give you mad props...er...umm...credit where credit is due. You'e one of few who gives no one a pass, regardless of side of the aisle they're on. Clearance Mitchell IV (C4) is another. I may not agree on everything, but I can say both give unbiased opinions, mostly.
@BreitbartNews The NFL has found themselves in a lose lose situation...the titan is going down.
@NRO @SenJohnMcCain @rkylesmith You guys crack me up! This is the same John McClain who often went off on temper tantrums at staff and others throughout the capital, but yeah...he's a selfless public servant!
@BreitbartNews WHO IN THE **** GIVES A **** WHAT JIM CARREY THINKS!
@IngrahamAngle Eventually!
@ArthelNeville Just saw your broadcast, these are images of the area Rich Edsen was reporting...those are the cars he was talking about and that water is how high that stream was he was talking about. https://t.co/vrAI5jW8mD

@EWErickson @JoeNBC How about ripping the child from their crackhead mother? Should we be upset about that?
@BGObsession Well...she was.
@dc_mma @LukeRockhold @akajav If he was training with Jackson @khabib_nurmagomedov would have been champion 2 years ago!
@CatoInstitute Capitalism at work!
@RealJamesWoods Don't forget smart TV's
@SenFeinstein Especially since the government in California is already robbing their citizens blind of their hard earned money.
@ByMikeJones Meh...sounds just like when he was with the Redskins...me, me, me!
@SenFeinstein Their parents should have thought of that before coming to the border. It's just like any parent who goes to jail in this country, they broke the law, so the government separates them from their parents...it happens every day!
@ChrisLoesch @NRA @DLoesch Not sure it's "due", but she did play a part. I think it's "due" to the outrage of the prospect of we the people being infringed upon.
@drew_lofton @LauraLoomer @realDonaldTrump @POTUS It began long before that! Look what the press did to Nixon.
@CatoInstitute @DamasdBlanco They fell in love with the Cuban dictators when Obama went to a baseball game with them.
@DailyCaller He means indoctrinating them!
@BreitbartNews Remember when Obama said he would fundamentally transform this nation? Well, Trump is changing it back and I think the left's heads will explode!
@MZHemingway Yup, thank God you and Obama acolytes are no longer in power...just a matter of time before the rest of your ilk is exposed!
@jpodhoretz Keep Nancy in Leadership, DNC!!! Oh yeah, and Tom Perez, Keith Ellison, don't forget Adam Schiff! As long as they have leaders like this, I think a GOP majority is safe.
@SenGillibrand But only women with a D next to their name! Or, if you're like Hilary, don't give you what you need like her endorsement of Cuomo!
@SenSchumer Give them tax breaks! Terminate Federal Income tax for all teachers!!!
@SenSchumer OK, here's how you, in the federal gov, can give teachers more money...tax breaks! Stop taxing teachers at the federal level...not federal income tax for all teachers grade K-12! But that should include private and charter teachers as well.
@SenatorDurbin Why would they stand up to the gun lobby?
@RealJamesWoods No...she will die on her sword before ever letting the hag go down.
@Mel_Milligan You can have mine! https://t.co/KxH8cF3UeM
@CR McCain most certainly...Romney? I am not so sure, Romney was pretty efficient in executive roles. Just matters if Romney's backbone would have been strong enough to stand up to opposition like Trump.
@guypbenson Why do you say that? That flat tire could have saved your life...who knows what could have happened if you were allowed to continue your journey unimpeded by that tire going flat?
@henryrodgersdc @DailyCaller Oh well...it was a tough road to unseat Minchin to begin with, this tool is just serving himself.
@nprpolitics Because that legal expert has an agenda. The DoJ is part of the Executive Branch, he can order them to expand the current IG investigation, as they did. Kinda like Obama did when he told them to go after Trump.
@SenFeinstein Umm...the DoJ is a part of the Executive Branch...here's a link to the White House website, it will show you. 		https://t.co/QIkg9QgZpx
@BurgundyBurner @HTTRoom If we actually get the compensatory picks we think we should, it'd be a no-brainer. The current crop is not as good going into the season as last year. Mid way through the season I kept hearing what I said before the start of last season...we need a veteran leader like Garcon.
@BurgundyBurner @HTTRoom I would pick up Dez Bryant on a 1 year, incentive laden contract at this point, after we see who may be available after June 1st. I think he was lost in transition in Dallas, he still has a lot left in the tank, if his head is on straight.
@HTTRoom With no WR talent to speak of, that run game better be something special.
@SenWhitehouse If that's true, then Hilary and Obama will serve time.
@CatoInstitute Capitalism!
@SenFeinstein LIAR!
@john_keim How? What about the talent we have "fits" Alex Smith? We have no one on the team like Tyreek Hill, so are you telling me Crowder is more of a "fit" for Alex Smith? If Reed is on the field, he may match what Kielce has, but that's a huge if...his talent? Specifically, what talent?
@john_keim OK, I may cede Doctson, but what are you saying? No Kareem Hunt, no Tyreek Hill, no Travis Kelce. Guice could be great RB, perhaps our 1st 1000yd RB since Morris, but we don't know, Reed can't stay on field and not a single WR compares to Hill, no true #1. What is our talent?
@bethanyshondark Is it hate or indifference?
@john_keim Talent in pass game? Crowder proved he's a true #3, can't step up w/out Garcon/Jackson. Doctson's a 1st round bust, until I'm proven otherwise. Who is that guy we got from Seattle? *sarcasm alert* Who else? Reed? He's good for what...3 games? WR is single least talented group.
@DailyCaller Well...if anyone knows criminal opulence, I'd say Maxine "Crookedest Congressman" Waters knows, with her million dollar mansion, but never held a real job.
@SenFeinstein Oh stop! MS-13 members are animals, and anyone capable of basic comprehension know that's what he was talking about! #dishonest
@MeghanMcCain Sure wish your father was capable of doing that instead of being bitter toward Trump, thus voting against his promises to repeal ACA.
@SenFeinstein Kinda like Obama did when he was President and Harry was in charge?
@SenFeinstein Then why did you vote for John Brennan?
@DailyCaller Americans are still waiting for her father to apologize for being a spiteful turncoat voting NOT to repeal ACA when he was re-elected because of promise to do so. He doesn't care about America...if he did, he'd resign considering his inability to do his job.
@UnfilteredSE @secupp @andylevy @ComicDaveSmith @morninggloria Works for me!
@DineshDSouza @KurtSchlichter FFS drop it. You broke the law and were unfairly convicted, we get it. Rosie will likely skate. Let it go!
@MarkCorallo1 John McCain WAS a hero. He became cowardly and hypocritical when he became irrelevant in the GOP after his disastrous presidential run followed by Trump's success. He was re-elected in 2016 with Trump's help, and turned his back on his party once he was re-elected to spite Trump.
@SenFeinstein Thank God!
@IngrahamAngle Then tell us how anyone on the right defends themselves against the false attacks?
@SenSchumer Ha! that's all you got Senator? How about? "Ya know...he's right. I am opposing something just because Trump did it." In the past you supported it. Brennan confirmation was a go, but you are demonizing Gina!
@IngrahamAngle @JohnBrennan @SenJohnMcCain Is it really John McCain? Is he actually lucid enough to tweet?
@SenJohnMcCain You sir, are full of crap! You were all for waterboarding in past. Now? Your bitterness for Trump is so overwhelming you'd vote against anything Trump, even if it contradicts your previous beliefs. JUST GO AWAY! If you loved this country, you'd resign. You no longer love USA!!!!
@KurtSchlichter Who are you, again?
@SenFeinstein ELECTIONS HAVE CONSEQUENCES!!!
@DailyCaller ELECTIONS HAVE CONSEQUENCES!!!!
@HTTRoom Talent? Where? Redskins are not a bad team, but every off-season I hear this and every season I wonder what pundits see that I don't. By the end of the season, turns out they saw something different than I did. This is an 8-8 team, at best.
@SenFeinstein Nah...Obama giving a terror state billions in American cash was far more credibility diminishing.
@SenFeinstein How can you be that naive? Iran was never going to back down from attempting to obtain nuclear weapons.
@SenFeinstein I hope he undoes more! Obama nearly ruined our country!
@SenGillibrand Are you so naive as to think Iran is actually holding their end of the "bargain"?
@timkaine Because they lie?
@CatoInstitute That's a crock! Had Obama negotiated a status of forces agreement, ISIS would not have been able to develop a foothold. Obama left the vacuum for them to grow.
@JoeNBC Right...and before you were trying to destroy Donald Trump, you actually had a hint of objectivity. But...events unfold and the truth comes out in people. Things and circumstances change. Now you're simply worthless.
@BGObsession I will admit, I wanted James. I also know that he is better at his position than Payne is at his at this point in their careers. However, the Skins chose to go with need over BPA so I accept it and will continue to root for a Chargers team I've always liked to begin with.
@jsteelznskins Why? If you're first to know, then drop it. Unless it's the source asking.
@HomerMcFanboy @BGObsession Not sure how many fans wanted Guice, I think most wanted Ronald Jones or even Chubb.
@john_keim Me too...Derwin!
@HogsHaven YES!!!
@HogsHaven But no James is certainly going to Tampa
@HogsHaven Ugh
@NBCSRedskins @TandlerNBCS I ain't skeer'd. We usually play them late in the season and this kid cannot take the 25 carry a game work load for 16 games.
@KatiePavlich Not much out there better than watching the sunset over the Lincoln Memorial from the Washington Monument.
@TandlerNBCS If that guy falls to us, we have to take him. He's the next Ed Reed.
@BurgundyBurner Derwin James is better at his position than Vea is at his position.
@TandlerNBCS @JennaLaineESPN @DhaSickest Is it the way he dresses, or that the style is indicative of the man? Those who dress flashy tend to be about themselves first and foremost, peacock syndrome. Humility goes a long way. Team players are more important, just ask the NE Patriots.
@TandlerNBCS Would prefer Derwin, but won't be upset to see Payne. I'd prefer to see Vea go elsewhere.
@Timerican @KurtSchlichter Haha! They're not sold in other countries because the AK47 has saturated those markets. What a big dummy!
@SenGillibrand Kinda like Elena Kagan? Or Sotomayor?
@SebGorka Meanwhile, we'll all sit back and watch Dr. Kennedy beat you in the primary!
@TandlerNBCS I know how desperate the Redskins are for help along the DL, but I can't stop thinking of what an impact my fellow Seminole will make on that defense. I would probably have to choose James. Vea is a 2 down player, so I'd rather have Payne anyway, but Derwin is  special.
@SenFeinstein You threaten raised premiums, yet I saw our premiums increase by nearly 100% while Obama was President. Who are you kidding with your threats of increases?
@chicksonright Oer priced.
@Sen_JoeManchin That vote might save you in November.
@TandlerNBCS Much, much better!
@jpodhoretz They're doing everything they can to tear him down. 		I am not Hannity fan...stopped watching him long ago, but it's getting out of control.
@jaketapper Bullshit! Victimize them all you want, but the overwhelming majority of drug addicts are scum!
@politicalmath @KurtSchlichter I'm upset about it. It's pure theatrics and they know it. So they're saying this woman is incapable of getting childcare? Now what? Babies will be required by law to be allowed in Board meetings? Assembly lines? What's next?
@SherylNYT @SenDuckworth So you're saying a woman in Congress is unable to find childcare?
@TheDailyShow @ChelseaClinton How about the bullying your mother perpetrated against the victims of your father?
@SenSchumer So your for states' rights?
@SenFeinstein Shooter drills? In the 50's, 60's and 70's they were active Nuclear war drills. In your era air raids.
@john_keim Jonathan Allen went 17 last year. I would still rather have Derwin James if he's at 13, but am afraid Dallass would end up with Payne.
@SenGillibrand Advocates? Let them organize something during the weekend to see how many show up!
@HTTRoom Nope...cannot pass! He is the real deal. I think he's better than Fitzpatrick. Unfortunately, if we do choose him Payne will likely end up in Dallass, or Vea.
@TandlerNBCS Am I the only one who noticed the significant decline in production from Barkley as the 12 game college season wore on? Imagine how he holds up in a 16 game NFL season. Skins still need DL help, but not because of Barkley.
@OldSchool80s Happy birthday!
@cvpayne And at the time, Bush's mission was accomplished, Saddam Hussein was ousted.
@danawhite She's prettier and knows more bout Krav Maga.
@SebGorka @KurtSchlichter But doesn't think Clinton bombed Iraq when Ken Starr was about to release his findings?
@SenatorDurbin Meanwhile, Trump advances their cause in their home country so they can stay there.
@DailyCaller Let her go to South Africa.
@ByronYork Kinda sounds like you're rooting for Nancy Pelosi to be in charge of the House.
@SenJohnMcCain @MilitaryTimes Gonna blame that one on Trump, too?
@danawhite Lame April Fools!
@TandlerNBCS Of course, but with Vea and Payne almost certain to be available, is Smith the best player available or is the talent level close enough you go with the bigger need?
@mkhammer Happy Easter MKH!!!
@therealroseanne Enjoy the success of your new show, but please don't sing the anthem again!?!?!?		😂
@FoxNews @HillaryClinton Was saying it to her husband, was saying it to Al Gore, was saying it to Jimmy Carter long before I began saying it to her. I call her a shill because she one. GO AWAY!~
@DiamondandSilk If this attorney can get to the bottom of things, a 2nd counsel will be unnecessary. If there is more stalling/concealing then it may become time for sessions to go, and get an AG who is willing to expose the Obama fraud once and for all.
@TandlerNBCS Meh...we're lucky he wanted to try to play again so we could get an extra 5th...yeah, I know we spent a 2nd, but it looked like that 2nd was completely lost. Get what you can and move on. Moving on is bonus in &amp; of itself.
@TomiLahren Of course he would, that's what most narcissists think.
@JamesHasson20 But they don't care, which is why I cannot fathom the willingness to work with them on issues like the budget that just passed. It is a huge loss for Conservatism. Do they know how this will effect GOP turnout in the midterms?
@katherinemiller I will select any treadmill I want!
@KurtSchlichter Problem? This will not motivate voters from the GOP to turn out in November...one step closer to Nancy Pelosi returning to power in Congress...worse, it could spell doom for both chambers. While Schumer is not Harry Reid...he's not far off!
@SenFeinstein https://t.co/bsIxXFrT0y
@RepBeatty You're talking about the thousands killed in Chicago over the last 5 years, right?
@KurtSchlichter @instapundit Especially the standards being used when giving out grades. They give out A's to everyone!
@jpodhoretz You can't? Aren't you a writer?
@CatoInstitute Wrong, only a decision to negotiate a status of forces agreement would have!
@nytimes Ur country is so weak, they accept despotism &amp; murderous dictator, but given chance, blame Americans for giving them opportunity to be free from tyranny? Iraqis should be responsible for their own country &amp; rebuild! Billions of $ and American blood was given for them!
@seanmdav Please tell me that is not true.
@john_keim @redskinner39 Why not? They would have 2 1st round talent DL's in their rookie contracts, they can afford to sign a big name.
@SenJohnMcCain You're so petty! If that's even you.
@john_keim Is he worth the money? The Redskins have to get better on both sides of the line, now! Philly had the best interior DL in Cox, then just traded to get another best in the league DL in Bennett. Redskins? Piddle paddle about a few $$$!
@timkaine By taking all guns?
@SenFeinstein So should ILLEGAL entrants into our nation be a part of the US Census?
@timkaine Then tell those that govern Puerto Rico to get their act together and utilize the resources they've been given to help their population instead of stealing or mishandling those resources!
@Cody_Nolove Yeah...don't get much better than that!
@SenFeinstein As long as you agree to tell those in the DOJ to stop covering up for the Obama/Clinton corruption!
@ByronYork Or it could be the deep state Obama installed prior to leaving office that would hamper any success for his successor? What kind of man would intentionally sabotage the President replacing him?
@JPFinlayNBCS @john_keim They should have given Robinson the money. They will not find a WR like him in the draft and we have a desperate need for a legit #1 WR.
@AdamSchefter With not one being the real deal.
@john_keim Problem is...they can spend on one big name, while signing lower tier players. Look at Philly. Sheldon Richardson or Allen Robinson, are worth it. There is being tight, then there is being too tight, and the shock of the early 2000's seems to loom too large in Ashburn.
@FoxNews @GeraldoRivera And? Trump should have just cleaned house last year when first in office. Obama succeeded creating obstacles for Trump success, distracting Trump complete focus as President with these traps in place before he left office. Who sabotages the newly elected incoming President?
@john_keim Haha! He was never in the mix for DC.
@pfrumors Good, let these players know we don't watch the NFL to see them protest, we watch to see them play. There are consequences for actions. I hope he gets washed away in the flood of outrage against social justice being forced into sports.
@ChrisThompson_4 Huh?
@NBCSRedskins Cam Newton?
@chicksonright And to think, this is who could have been our President.
@RandPaul What's wrong with waterboarding?
@SarahPalinUSA Did they drive her to her daughter's apartment so the doctor could privately give her the proper treatment for her seizures? Oh wait, they're not in NYC.
@AreuCathy @FoxNews @seanhannity @TomiLahren Ms. Areu, you are easily the single most dishonest person I have ever seen on Fox or any other news network. If I never see you in the media in any fashion, it will be too soon. I rarely wish failure upon people, but I seriously hope your career in journalism fails!
@kirstiealley Have you reached alien interaction level yet?
@BGObsession @JovaisG @Redskins Not if he's not good enough and you want to see someone younger and better come in.
@jpodhoretz A lot of hype being placed on a runoff for a district that won't exist in 19 months.
@katherinemiller @jpodhoretz @B_M_Finnigan Absentees in Allegheny County should be available before midnight according to a report from their pollsters.
@benshapiro This vote means little in the grand scheme, but don't you think the DNC will be able to raise money, and garner more votes with a victory here?
@AdamSchefter He would be a great compliment to Henry.
@TandlerNBCS How many receptions did Richardson have 2 years ago?
@seanhannity I told you last week after you had that lying woman on your show, if she appears again, I will never watch you again...nothing wrong with opposing views, but she is a blatant liar! I will not watch Hannity again! EVER!
@ChrisThompson_4 You deserve more than he does.
@UnfilteredSE @secupp I have changed my views on Capital Punishment, but the argument..."some lives a  valuable and others aren't..." is a poor one. Child in womb = innocent / Convict of heinous crime = evil. Evil is less valuable!
@jaketapper @jeffzeleny @TheLeadCNN Yeah, like John Kerry and Hilary Clinton instilled a sense of stability throughout the world!   ***sarcasm alert***
@WSJPolitics Wait! John McCain? Is he capable of actually performing the duties of his office?
@JulieBanderas WTF is that woman talking about, you're hot! Oh wait! Am I allowed to say that? #metooscaresme
@ananavarro @laloalcaraz Of course you do, because you're a hack who does not understand the US Constitution.
@ananavarro @jaketapper Yet you're entangled in the web of fake news, lack of integrity, and are a partisan hack!
@john_keim Every team does it...there must be diligence. Yeah, I know it gets out of control, I used to be a member at Extremeskins. But every team should be looking at every release to see if that players fits their plans.
@SenatorDurbin You are lying, he presented a 4 point plan, in that plan 1.8 million dreamers would have been given citizenship, even though they do not deserve it! LIAR!!!
@seanhannity @TomiLahren @AreuCathy Sean, if you ever give that woman who tried to equate white men with illegals air time again, I will never watch your show again and call on many to do the same. There is having an opposing view, and then there is what that ignoramus said!~
@SenGillibrand And many want the opportunity to defend themselves!~
@JonahNRO Kill more deer, they're disease infested and over populated!
@MichelleObama @Rachel__Nichols @BarackObama Then why didn't Barry pass gun legislation when he had a super majority?
@DaniellaMicaela @jaketapper @danmericaCNN Were you equally outraged when Obama was on the golf course the morning following the Benghazi murders?
@mkhammer There are few people in today's world I consider heroes, you are one of them. I truly commend you! The adversity you over come is evident by your availability through media. God Bless you!
@ReggieMillerTNT Stick to basketball you idiot!
@TomiLahren You actually expect that from them?
@BurgundyBurner I hope so, we need a TE who can block. Niles Paul has been a great ST guy, but we need a true TE to block.
@BurgundyBurner He's a freak, Gates and Gonzalez went further, he is physically more capable than both.
@BurgundyBurner I think Davis will have the more productive season being reunited with his old team mate.
@SenFeinstein Should they have just leaked it the way you leaked info a few weeks back?
@jpodhoretz He wants to be in the spotlight. If he'd wait, he would probably get Secretary of State when Tillerson quits.
@BretBaier @Comey Won't be many named James Comey, either.
@SenSchumer How about we fund these type of community health centers with the waste and bloat of the failed ACA?
@jaketapper Not acting anymore.
@PaigeVanzantUFC Broke mine in the exact same place in car crash, and still attended an NFL playoff game 30 minutes later. Thought I was pretty tough. You are tougher!
@ThatEricAlper Chitty Chitty Bang Bang. The Child Catcher scared me more than any other character in the history of cinema!
@timkaine Meanwhile, your son received a slap on the wrist!
@SenFeinstein You want to make the world a better place? Send these illegals home with their free American education to make their homeland a better place.
@RealJamesWoods What was the actual bad beat payout? $122.7k? Or did you 50% of that?
@richardbranson By offering them space on Necker Island?
@RealJamesWoods I thought you were talking about Obama.
@SenGillibrand Yet last year you cozied up to Bill Clinton quite nicely! Outrage of convenience?
@jpodhoretz Were those his exact words, are are you drawing conclusions?
@JoeNBC Even the ones incapable of putting their ideology aside to truthfully investigate corruption?
@RealJamesWoods Meanwhile, the tiny socialist fairies in the country feel the evil monster coming along to shatter their dreams of "utopia"...unicorns and rainbows everywhere are dying!
@nytimes We'll see, I would not be a bit surprised to see him wait to watch the vote count and vote against it if there are only 49 before him.
@SenSchumer Yup, and you skip out on a meeting with the GOP leadership yesterday. How very convenient.
@SenSchumer How many times do I have to call you a hypocrite? You had no problem with the 10 trillion Obama added!
@timkaine Please tell me exactly how seniors will be effected? I want every detail!
@SenFeinstein If you're so upset for not having the whole thing before voting, blame Schumer and Pelosi for not attending a meeting with Trump, Ryan, and McConnell yesterday! The anger should be at your own leadership!
@SenSchumer Just stop! You were part of the behind closed doors creation of ACA that did not include a single member of the GOP! You're being a hypocrite!
@SenGillibrand If you want debate, then why did your leaders walk out of a meeting with GOP leaders yesterday?
@jpodhoretz Which line is a good one for him? Yet, he keeps chugging along.
@TheJuanWilliams Thats BS!!! EVERYONE knows John McCain's vote against repeal of ACA was a direct slap in the face to Trump. McCain is part of the swamp that needs drained!
@GitRDoneLarry I looooooooved her!
@TIME Doesn't mean someone from Time didn't break protocol and call him.
@JessicaTarlov @TheFive @FoxNews I don't agree with much of what you say, and get a bit annoyed at your incessant need to interrupt the opposing view, but ignore the mean tweets...you nor anyone else deserve them. Well...almost anyone, Hilary Clinton deserves them.
@DailyCaller Meanwhile, the overwhelming majority of sexual predators outed in the recent past have all been Dems...
@TonyDungy Saints
@jaketapper Yup, ungrateful, entitled pricks should have been left to rot for a while so they understand the consequences of their actions. Instead, they get a pass and now they just go about the business of being entitled to more.
@timkaine Where was your outrage over the cost of colleges over the past 8 years!?!?!?
@SenFeinstein It is not unprecedented, Obama pushed you guys to do the same thing!
@SenSchumer The same exact tactics were used to get the ACA abomination passed, stop being a hypocrite!
@KirstenPowers You have images of Trump groping a woman's breasts while she sleeps, or is the locker room talk still all you have?
@brianklaas Haha! you sound like Sean Hannity crying about Obama's past relationship with Jeremiah Wright. Who gives a s***!??!?!?!?!
@SenFeinstein Affordable housing in California? Maybe if the state would stop taxing every aspect of life in Cali, people could afford new homes.
@SenFeinstein Just a quick question...why is every single post of your's a partisan effort to vilify the GOP? Not that there isn't some truth to about 15%, but you are 100% anti-GOP!
@SenGillibrand Or over taxing/regulating like we saw under Obama?
@TandlerNBCS It's the world we have grown up in for the last 15 years as social media has boomed. The loudest voices get heard, so people want to be loud.
@benshapiro Right, but the repeated purchase of pods is no longer going to be an option since you cannot brew them...that's a boycott, no?
@FrankLuntz Well, it kinda is, Frank. If you throw out the machine, you won't be buying more pods...the repeated buying of pods is how they make their money.
@SenSchumer Right, because if you had your way, you'd get all 5 fingers, and a couple of toes, leaving hard workers with less to pay for the 48% who pay no taxes.
@SenJohnMcCain Did he talk about a war hero who became a traitor to his constituents over a petty difference with his party's president?
@SenFeinstein Not as quickly as Obama did because of obstructionists like you.
@JoeNBC And of course, the numbers showed Hilary winning by large margin. Have you learned nothing?
@SenFeinstein You were part of doubling the deficit for 8 years, now you want to talk about driving up our debt? Hypocritical?
@marklevinshow No surprise, it's a blue state now.
@TandlerNBCS Haha! I was just kidding.
@TandlerNBCS We all know you can and will use every one of them!
@SenFeinstein Because your state and local taxes already rob them.
@john_keim Do we actually know what money he was?
@SenFeinstein Shameful to raise medical costs? You voted for a bill that has seen my insurance rates sky rocket!
@john_keim And it wasn't called.
@SenSchumer A tweet from you I can support.
@john_keim Gruden should also get slammed for calling the TO giving Seattle a chance at the end. He had plenty of time to get players on field.
@SenGillibrand Weren't you just giving Trump a hard time for politicizing truck attack in NYC too soon?
@DLoesch This is what 8 years of Obama's rhetoric about fighting/attacking GOP creates.
@SenFeinstein Then lower tax rates in California...the most taxed state in the nation.
@SenFeinstein You know as well as the rest of us she should be in jail.
@DLoesch It's rich coming from the most expensive first lady in the history of our country...talk about entitled!
@SenJohnMcCain @tombrokaw @TODAYshow @NavalAcademy Just more proof of your liberal roots. Sit down with someone like Mark Levin.
@guypbenson She means strip funds from the DNC.
@maddow No, but we're all sure you'll come up with another wild conspiracy theory for us to mock.
@DailyCaller Because we don't care what Jeter or any other "athlete" thinks...we just want to see a game to take our minds of the rest!
@SenSchumer Obama never pulled us together after terror strikes...wait, he didn't call them terrorism, so i can see how you might get that mixed up.
@KatTimpf Can't get excited for it while still waiting til after Thanksgiving to really start listening?
@KevinNR And why does he feel the need to defend Islam?
@SenSchumer And at certain times in our history, immigration was limited, even shut down for the security of the nation.
@DiamondandSilk But but but...why did Trump hire him? ***sarcasm alert***
@IngrahamAngle You're welcome!
@SenSchumer What about an investigation into Hilary? This time one that is not hindered by the DNC and media.
@SenGillibrand What about Hilary? Do you want to expose her corruption?
@SenSchumer @SenateMajLdr Because you are dragging out the process to keep Trump from getting his people in place?
@jcokasrealtor Ummm...updates should be done consistently, every spring...every summer.
@kevins980 Sounds like Giants' game last year, w D on their heels Skins driving easily, Gruden calls TO and Cousins throws INT next play to end game.
@JoeNBC So you're fine with the leaks coming out of this "fine man's" investigation? Leaks are illegal!
@mkhammer You are one of the most admirable in the media. Thank you for your diligence, and honesty. This guy appreciates a single mom like you.
@SenGillibrand You ask a lot for the unfortunate, you asking incapacity as Sen for more tax $ or individual? Gov cannot solve all problems, but people can!
@RosLehtinen @SenJohnMcCain As am I, but I wish old man would've retired &amp; not pawn of left over petty vendetta. "Senator" you voted no to spite Trump, we all know it.
@SenFeinstein Send her back 2 country of origin, tell her she's welcome for the education rec'ved living here illegally. Help your home country be better.
@SenJohnMcCain @WSJ Wasn't he Jones Act suspended?
@BMitchliveNBCS Then why do you consistently plant seeds of discord?
@DLoesch I love spending time in Ukrainia!
@SenSchumer And then deported for being here illegally. She had the privilege of surgery here, now send them back. #illegalisillegal
@SenSchumer When will you stop sensationalizing and be the Senator I remember from the 90's who worked across party lines? Not the liar you've become.
@jpodhoretz Not saying you're wrong, but Beck was going off on crazy conspiracy theories.
@SenJohnMcCain @JeffFlake You should follow him into the sunset!
@greta You
@TonyDungy Their creativity on offense is in San Fran, now.
@jaketapper She was coached and if you can't see that, you're blind! And I am no fan of TRUMP!! I just love how left's head explodes over his antics.
@timkaine Well, didn't Obama minimize our role around the world? How'd that go? Syria? A mess. Iraq? ISIS grows! Libya? Under guarded embassy!
@ShannonBream Umm...just as long as it's not Old Spice?
@Heritage I sure hope so!
@SenFeinstein Maybe they can go back to their country of origin and use the skills they freely were given here to make their home country better?
@SenFeinstein Then let he return to her country of origin to help make it a better place.
@FoxNews @SenSchumer Except for Obama's...oh wait! Did Congress pass a budget under Obama? Doesn't law dictate a budget be passed by Congress every year?
@nytopinion @CharlesMBlow Coming from the Oped at the NYT from a guy named Blow? Haha! The irony is fruitful!
@pavanderbilt @SenFeinstein Mine went up 30% this year.
@SenFeinstein It insures us because it's extortion, and the premiums still going up!
@CoryBooker Not seeking perfection, but it'd be nice to see you have a 3rd grade grasp of you native language.
@SenJohnMcCain All down the drain because you lied to your constituents to get re-elected, saying you'd repeal, then voting against repeal!
@SenJohnMcCain Duty? Duty? You were re-elected because you campaigned on repealing ACA!!! Turncoat!
@SenJohnMcCain @ConstitutionCtr @JoeBiden You gonna vote for him in 2020, turncoat?
@john_keim How befitting after Kyle sent ex-Redskins out for coin toss.
@TomFitton @LouDobbs It's a good thing...take away their platform. We don't need to watch at home. If you want to watch it, go to... https://t.co/xUSduUvIBA
@bethanyshondark @benshapiro Big fan of Ben, but in terms of strategy...what other time would be better? They don't care what you think, just their message unfettered.
@LizMair Fair? Hahaha! Like SNL is fair with the direction of their ire!
@SenFeinstein Like Obama did when he was President?
@DLoesch I don't think he even realizes how stupid it sounded when he said it.
@DailyCaller Right...and her husband committed perjury when he said he wasn't!
@FoxNews @SenSchumer PREMIUMS ARE ALREADY SHOOTING UP!!!!!!!!!!! 30% this year!
@timkaine You mean like the 30% increase I will already see this year?
@SenFeinstein I'm already going to see an increase of 30% this year, like I did last year!
@SenGillibrand Increases premiums? My premiums have gone up yearly approx 30% each year! They're already going up!!!
@BenSasse @jpodhoretz If you read the tweet sent by Trump, it says "fake news" should be remedied. False reports should be held liable!
@SenJohnMcCain @POTUS Quit being a petulant child and work with him to keep promises you've made for 7 years!!!!
@SenGillibrand Right, and he said they won't be there forever! Not they were leaving tomorrow!!!! Stop creating drama!
@timkaine What is wrong with you? FEMA cannot stay forever, that is a factual statement!
@SenSchumer Right, until the job is done...not FOREVER Like President said.
@greta Because Obama spent 8 years ignoring the danger, focusing instead to make the GOP the enemy.
@HARRISFAULKNER @OutnumberedFNC I look forward to the day Harris Faulkner gets her own prime time show, she deserves it!
@RobertGBeckel Umm...Bob, he declared Cali a disaster, qualifying them for federal relief funds.
@RobertGBeckel @SheriffClarke @realDonaldTrump Health care would have passed if not for that asshat, John MCain! That turncoat is worse than Harry Reid, didn't think that was possible.
@jaketapper @realDonaldTrump Nice try, but liability exists for those who lie.
@jsmooth995 She wasn't "reporting"! She called for boycott of Jerry Jones and the Cowboys. That's not news! That's activism!
@HashtagGriswold Then, they reverse direction after the fact.
@JJWatt Sorry? What you did to raise money for Houston after hurricane leave the mark most will remember from you. #truehero
@SteveScalise @Nationals @Cubs And threw a strike! Great job!
@nprpolitics So, guns are coming across state lines...illegally? Or they're being sold illegally? Are being used illegally to murder? Got it
@SenSchumer So you want wasteful policies to stay in place?
@KirstenPowers So they break the laws already in place? Hmm...then we should make more gun laws for them to break.
@BMitchliveNBCS Stick to football...no one cares what you think about anything else!
@ddale8 He went up after endorsement and then lost ground toward the closing bell. You're wrong.
@benshapiro Wouldn't trust a Mayor with pallets of food behind her, talking about people dying.
@SenGillibrand Why? The Mayor in San Juan lied through her teeth, image of despair she paints a as the pallet of goods behind her sits.
@SenFeinstein Such a lie! My rates have increased every year under Obama!
@danawhite Illegal knee? Sweep put his knee on the ground when the knee to the head put him out.
@GitRDoneLarry Drew Carey?
@SenJohnMcCain Retire!
@SenGillibrand Hate to disappoint you, but it was McCain's disdain for Trump, and the threat from Schumer to all D's to vote party lines or lose funds.
@SenatorDurbin Fix it? That's what Obamacare was supposed to do, there is no "fixing" it!
@GlennKesslerWP @jaketapper @jameshohmann Did you call Obama the same when he told followers to fight GOP? "They bring knife, you bring gun!" Far more divisive!
@TonyDungy Some will, most don't want self-righteous players preaching life's injustices. We want football! #shutupplaythegame #ncaafootballisbetter
@Chet_Cannon @chelseahandler You're funny. Oh wait! This wasn't a joke? Are you really that stupid?
@MeghanMcCain Then tell him to set aside his petty differences with Trump and REPEAL!!! He promised us repeal for almost 8 years now.
@greta Watch OAN
@MeghanMcCain @SenJohnMcCain Love you Meghan, but he should have retired...his no vote was as petty a political move as I've seen in my lifetime. I wish him retirement.
@thehill Yeah, just like when Biden stood before the black crowd in VA telling them, "They gonna put ya'll back in chains!"
@SportsCenter Yup, and Manny fought a fighter that wasn't months away from his 40th birthday either.
@FoxNews @SenSchumer Meanwhile, Chuck Schumer continues down the rabbit hole of dishonesty...used to be a politician I could respect. Now? Partisan hack!
@ChrisLoesch I know right...I was listening to the interview last night of MacGregor and one would have thought he'd won the fight.
@davidaxelrod @POTUS Well, he could be playing golf. #hypocrite
@davidaxelrod @BarackObama Yup, like when he told cops in Dallas they were responsible for some maniac killing 5 of their own.
@davidaxelrod Now you know how 60% of the country felt for the previous 8 years...Obama is why Trump is here, thank him for this mess!
@davidaxelrod Haha! Obama said, "It's the GOP's fault!" It's George Bush's fault!" Never once taking responsibility for his poor decisions. Hypocrite!
@KennedyNation Haha! I liked, then unliked...just like like again!
@FoxNews As long as the Federal Government is not filling that role, who cares? There is a huge void and people think Gov should fill it...nonsense!
@davidaxelrod @GOP Bwhahahaha! Nice try to minimize another example of DNC buffoonery. District has shifted left since Newt held seat...Trump won by 1 point!~
@greta Community Clinics used to work...what happened?
@greta Greta, I always respected you and still do. Why do you insist on replying to accusations of bias cuz ur at MSDNC now? U know ur not bias.
@greta Yup, and she left the White House broke.
@davidaxelrod @POTUS Yup, he can't be sued like Obama..."You can keep your doctors!" Get real!
@jsteelznskins Would rather have had Demarcus Walker.
@SenSchumer Yup, the price of going back to work. Don't act like you speak Spanish!
@rak98 You were traded back to the Redskins.
@diannaESPN What an idiotic statement...many people like Bruce Allen!
@stephenasmith Umm...so they can see what they have?
@LizMair Who are you?
@greta Troll social media, rally against authority, and smoke marijuana?
@MuhammadSmiry Islam is not perfect...dhimmi, I don't pay, I die? Sounds perfect enough to me!
@secupp Weren't they in harm's way before the strikes?
@JedediahBila How do you feel about the first filibuster toward a SC nominee?
@john_keim @MikeWiseguy Racist! Black, white, yellow or purple, they need to hire best candidate!
@SenFeinstein Pork programs that simply cost too much for the minimal benefit they offer.
@andypollin1 But what about Romo?
@kevins980 Then why not do it when Barry was fired, could have lured a proven DC here. I like Greg M, but he's not the answer.
@jbstarr10 Patchic and stupid.
@jackies63 The fact that you ask this question shows how stupid you are. No time for utter stupidity.
@SybilT2 Your point? Because he's not president means he is acting to undermine Trump? Are you always this stupid?
@derekahunter pfft! You like Dirty Dancing!
@Kasparov63 Is he supposed to sit back while Obama and his minions go after him? They have created a base camp at Obama's house.
@ChrisLoesch Really? He looked lean, no pock marks we've seen on him before.
@ChrisLoesch Yeah, great fight.
@greta I will tell you I find you to be one of the most honest, straight-forward in the media biz, even if I don't watch you anymore.
@kilmeade It must be so fun dealing with shedding, especially in the spring.
@DailyCaller Yup, and Pence tweeted, "White House, Congress, Supreme Court."
@KirkHerbstreit Exactly where I saw tide turn. Kyle did same in DC, 2 many 4th Q leads lost because he trows ball 2 much when he should run.
@greta @TerryMcAuliffe Wrong...it will be Kirsten Gillibrand.
@KirstenPowers But they did not provide the proper security.
@nbbedi No Ban on all muslims...repeat it as often as you'd like, it's not true. Not all Muslims banned, not even 1% of the 1.2 billion.
@nazarbedi Sheep? You're followin the DNC talking point verbatim. Ties in Kyrgyzstan? Turkmenistan? Tajikistan? Algeria? Morrocco? No.
RT @benshapiro: Tell me more about leaving people to die in war zones, "it was a YouTube video" spokesperson. https://t.co/gNmc2wYR9B
@BillKristol Haha! You failed during the election, and you'd fail in future attempt. I will officially stop following you on twitter now.
@BillKristol Fellow Conservatives? You're not suggesting you're Conservative, are you?
@DLoesch Ironic, Obama pardons a traitor who gave material to Assange, yet decries the source exposing DNC.
@BillKristol Haha! Didn't you learn your lesson? These polls don't accurately represent the truth, election shoulda taught you!
@BillKristol You support what Lewis said?
@michaeldweiss @JoeTrippi Is Obama sending them Uranium?
@JedediahBila You do realize there are several different plans on the table right now?
@BillKristol You're also the guy who says he's a conservative but would have been happy to see Hilary Clinton become President.
@AdamCarriker94 Congratulations!
@ChrisThompson_4 HTTR! Go Noles! https://t.co/li3MXj4kqh
@DLoesch Who cares? I for one am happy to see an overhyped fighter finished for good.
@ChrisThompson_4 He may end up wishing he had, he only firmly won 2 rounds. Judges are funny...wanna be champ? Beat champ.
@ChrisLoesch I wager you're a Cruz fan...he lost this fight.
@ChrisLoesch I think they were pissed Hendricks came in 3.5 pounds over weight so they were looking to give Neil the fight.
@ChrisThompson_4 @FSU_Football Go Noles! HTTR!
@GeraldoRivera @realDonaldTrump Umm...did any of them murder their citizens? You still get into boxing ring? Head been hit 2 many times?
@jessebwatters Pfft!
@BreitbartNews He is a race baiter and always has been.
@ShannonBream Go Noles!
@BreitbartNews She lacks qualification.
@FoxNews @TheSun Inflation in that village is about to go up.
@nytopinion Like Obama... you can keep your plans, you can keep our doctors? You're simply shameful! People like you are why he won.
@HARRISFAULKNER Condolences...you are a great example for young women (and men) everywhere.
@RyanNewYork @JoeTrippi I guess his reference to the "riots", not protests escaped you?
@JonahNRO This was the biggest news from the election.
@DLoesch Thank God!
@asmamk So what are you saying? You hate whites?
@ChrisLoesch Yeah, I am looking back over my lifetime and she's pretty terrible.
@BillKristol Are you cheering this?
@davidaxelrod @realDonaldTrump Umm...the Cuban population is for Trump in Dade. Are they the influx?
@BillKristol Ur just trying to defend your indefensible position. Please change affiliation the D, you are not Conservative. SCOTUS
@BillKristol Yet the Wikileaks documents cause you no concern?
@KirstenPowers When you were at Fox you did not spin...what happened?
@BillKristol Too late, back Trump and maybe help sway a handful of voters still not decided. Unless you want Hilary to be President.
@marklevinshow Sad to say, still not enough.
RT @KathyShelton_: I don’t care if Trump said gross things. I care that Hillary Clinton lied, terrorized, &amp; mocked me, defending my rapist.
RT @benshapiro: Hillary says she wants judges who have life experience. WHAT THE F*** DOES THAT HAVE TO DO WITH THE CONSTITUTION? https://t…
@stephenfhayes Why not?
@PierreGarcon Both
@megynkelly Some of like to watch w/out your incessant snide remarks. I have been forced to turn you off.
@DLoesch Indoctrination of our youth.
@DLoesch Like throwing feces at the wall to see what will stick...heat exhaustion in 77 degree weather? Oh, then let's go with pneumonia!
@JRubinBlogger It's interesting that you still buy into Trump a racist when he was never accused of it until he put R next to his name.
@rickklein But she's been battling pneumonia and had to brave 77 degree heat!
@RBReich You are ceasing...Trump taking people for granted, Hilary expecting Black vote. That is taking people for granted.
@RBReich Highlight lying in a campaign when you support a perjurer? Hahahaha!
@stephenasmith title shot is over...they lost to unranked team. Bama is crushing, Clemson will not slow down, Ohio St and Michigan, and FSU
@JoeTrippi Or, there was exposure of the corruption and the polls have gotten more honest?
@RBReich Dignity? U R truly mad if you think he was more dignified than Bush. Laughable. Any respect for u, holding cabinet position, = gone
@RBReich As they should...she's corrupt.
@RBReich Haha! The money big pharma has given her, this is empty rhetoric. She won't bite hand that feeds her.
@Gosunkugi247 Follow along dummy, during Obama's tenure when there was 10% unemployment, immigrants left on their own. No Jobs! Pure idiocy!
@Gosunkugi247 Time migration rates dropped, less jobs in this country for them. Under Obama. You're too stupid to understand correlation!
@davidaxelrod Yeah, since there were no jobs thanks to Obama mishandling the economy and forcing businesses to lay people off.
@BillKristol Wait! Is this 2 tweets in favor of Trump in one day?
@davidaxelrod @realDonaldTrump No! Ur saying what you want people to think...it's called lying. U did enough of that to get Obama elected.
@RBReich About as many as the corrupt Dems like Hilary, Wasserman Schultz, Allen Grayson.
@RBReich Meanwhile, Hilary said she did not send classified emails through server before Congress. #perjury
@JRubinBlogger No it won't...we're talking about the most corrupt politician this country has ever seen.
@ByronYork Not a Trump fan but recognize there are more polls that suggest dishonesty in favor of Clinton, than honest you infer.
@davidaxelrod @realDonaldTrump Meanwhile, Clinton gets a pass 4 breaking law, allowing Americans to die in Benghazi, and risking top secrets
@PhoKingQui @ChrisLoesch @DLoesch But the judge scored it that way was my point, not 10-8 for Connor in 1st. Good fight, I've seen better.
@PhoKingQui @ChrisLoesch @DLoesch Judge who scored it a draw gave rd 3 to Diaz 10-8. Other 2 gave 3 to Diaz, also. All 3 gave rd 2 to Connor
@JRubinBlogger Man has been in spotlight since the 80's hanging w black leaders, has never been called a racist, til runs 4 Presdient.
@RBReich Hate? Lke Obama telling you to fight, they bring knife, you bring gun? Vilifying GOP 4 8 years! That's hate, not your imagined hate
@PhoKingQui @ChrisLoesch @DLoesch Diaz won rd 3 solidly, Connor was running from him, Connor got his wind in 4th and won, lost 5th 2 Diaz.
@DLoesch I thought he won the fight too, but we knew if it was close, the decision would go to MacGregor for the rubber match.
@RBReich This gives you pause? How did you feel when Hilary said in her fake southern accent, "I don't feel noways tarred."
@BillKristol I really  cannot believe you are so bitter, you'd defend Hilary Clinton.
@BillKristol Where's Bill Kristol? turncoat!
@granthpaulsen He had a lane to pick up 4-5 more, but chose to cut it outside leaving himself open for that tackle.
@RBReich Under Obama's watch?
@RBReich You support a President that has added almost $10 trillion to the deficit and you're gonna mention someone else's debt? Hypocrisy!
@ToddDomke @maddow Umm...same way Bernie called Hilary the worst possible option for President, then go up on stage with her to support her?
@timkaine Hilary would have gone to jail had Obama not need to preserve his "legacy"...just ask Petraeus.
@JoeTrippi Laughable...Hilary oppose gay marriage or support? For Free Trade or against? I could go on and on.
@thecooleyzone How can you say that? RG3 looked him down the whole way, never took eyes off Barnidge.
@LarrySabato Didn't matter who GOP nominee was, this would still be their ploy. Trump just makes it easier for them.
@JudgeJeanine Now they're running with Mannafort story. When will someone actually lock her up!?!?!?!
@BillKristol Did you read the whole article? The investigator admits there is no proof of criminality on Mannafort's part!
@realDonaldTrump It would help if you reach out &amp; bring them into the fold. You will lose if you don't start making friends! #STOPHILARY
@davidaxelrod @realDonaldTrump He's right, Hilary's transgressions swept under rug. His? You/they misquote him and perpetuate the lies.
@BillKristol Why would you want Hilary to make the decision? You call yourself a Conservative and you'd want her to decide next SC seat?
@RBReich Would growth mean higher wages?
@chrislhayes But the DNC nominating a lying criminal doesn't concern you at all? Shill!
@chrislhayes Do you have the same board for Hilary? Nope...just brushing her criminal acts under the carpet. You're a shill.
@maddow Meanwhile, the Justice Department remains silnet on the Clinton Foundation. #chargescoming
@RBReich Give us the tax records of the Clinton Foundation.
@RBReich It wasn't praising Putin, it was admonishing the poor leadership this country has faced for the past 8 years. Nice spin!
@RBReich ...as a criminal, untrustworthy and vile.
@benshapiro He's been telling us the grass is blue and sky is green for 8 years...why do so many forgive his lies?
@davidaxelrod Why are you thanking him? Your political savvy is why he is where he is...w/out you he is nothing, certainly not a leader.
@RBReich Liar! He called on Russian hack to release the 30,000 they already hacked when she exposed US to dangers abroad with server.
@secupp Difference? Hilary lied to Smith's face. DNC xploiting mass murders helps develop false narrative. #gunsdontkill #peopledo
@KatiePavlich #baffling #willfulignorancerules
@JoeTrippi Because 9 mos into his 1st term, this country was attacked because of failed Clinton policies. Don't be dishonest. #poorinference
@davidaxelrod Yeah as Bernie supporters storm out of convention hall in protest. Haha!
@JebBush Then please bury the hatchet with Trump and go out on the road to ensure Hilary does not become President. You're the bigger man.
@TwitchyTeam I get the sentiment but how can anyone take this guy seriously...de-registration? What does that even mean? #TrumpPence16
@benshapiro I am no Trump fan, if it happens and she loses, I would be happy. Still think she wins. Must wash mouth out now!
@RBReich So you believe falling on her sword for Hilary is the right thing to do?
@davidaxelrod Race-baiter!
@naternot I wish that meant something, because I loathe SHilary.
@chrislhayes How could a party nominate a criminal like Hilary Clinton?
@chrislhayes You're such a liar. It's not a conspiracy, it's a demand for something other than corrupt data to prove human involvement.
@TheIJR Donald Trump stood\stands no chance to win anyway, don't blame it on Cruz.
@nytimes You call this grim and angry, but I bet you weren't saying the same thing about Obama in 08. Hypocrite!
@camanpour You used to be a journalist. What happened?
@business Does it include, Elon Musk, Larry Page, Sergey Brin, Mark Zuckerberg? Oh no! Wait! That's DNC money.
@chrislhayes Because you stoke the flames of anti-white sentiment in this country. Kudos race-baiter!
@maddow Yeah, but you will get at least 2 criminals we know about at the MSDNC Convention.
@davidaxelrod Nothing that happened this week tops Michael Brown's mother speaking at DNC convention. #foundedonlies
@RBReich No...no it wasn't. Obama in 12 was the biggest fear monger. Biden even told black group, "They gonna put you back in chains!"
@RBReich Hilary lied to Congress.
@KatiePavlich He did congratulate Trump
@janelleNBC They've been battling each other in Congress for years. King is a moderate, Cruz conservative. Nothing new.
@kailanikm @meetthepress @HallieJackson Of course King will say this, he has butted heads with Cruz for years.
@TheEconomist It was less about a failure by Cruz as much as the momentum of Trump's appeal.
@BillHemmer @tedcruz He did congratulate Trump in the first 30 seconds of his speech!
@JoeTrippi Ha! But that only counts the highest earners...how about the work force as a whole? I love numbers!
@davidaxelrod Why not? He's capable.
@timkaine More troubling is rhetoric that doesn't solve a thing geared toward taking our rights. What about weaponry that killed assailant?
@BreitbartVideo We had become different country until 1st balck president changed all that w/ rhetorical attack against anyone not of color
@JoeTrippi But he's coreect.
@FoxNews @POTUS Yet he's been dividing us for 8 years.
@RBReich Is Hilary getting her donations from the Chinese still?
@davidaxelrod With a President who continues to rush to judgment and demonize the police, what do you expect? #beersummit
@TheEconomist Like the current President has done such a fabulous job of it.
@granthpaulsen Because of his playoff performance? Only his 2nd playoff game, but he has looked mediocre under pressure...excels when not.
@chrislhayes And you can tell when hack "journalist" refuses to do job and report truth on Clinton, helping to conceal her criminality
@davidaxelrod You mean like Bernie saying Hilary is not qualified to be President? Like Obama in 08 and Obama now on Hilary?
@ainsleyearhardt @foxandfriends Of course she's running back to the center now that Bernie's aboard.
@nytimes Why not tell them life isn't fair?
@granthpaulsen Haha! He's been hit in the head a number of times.
@soulsister27 Doesn't make it false.
@soulsister27 https://t.co/2uZ4z6Z0lC
@soulsister27 I don't blame anyone for obstacles in life. I blame Obama for the division created. Apples oranges, nice try though.
@soulsister27 Keep blaming others...that will get you far in life.
@MichaelPallante What? It started with Beer Summit. Obama blamed cops, was wrong 4-5 more times now.
@Brunokica No, O and the media write the narrative and people like you follow blindly. Open your eyes.
@MichaelPallante Who said that?
@rankled2 You obviously are blinded by the likes of Sharpton, and the like. Go ahead and drink the kook-aid.
@soulsister27 Nice try, but Obama has larger pulpit from which to spew his venom against right w media steering narrative. Open your eyes!
@Brunokica What's your point?
@vedia_lupae You heard me, he has blamed cops and GOP for everything over the last 8 years...he has bred this atmosphere.
@nytimes After 8 years of demonizing the right, this is Obama's America.
@DLoesch Oh Dana...what it must be like to be an idealist.
@RickLeventhal You know he does this intentionally to get other side stirred up? It's divide and conquer tactic he's employed from day 1.
@SenFeinstein What about those dropping out?
@secupp I wish I could believe this, but this hearing will change nothing. Dems don't care how vile she is...they'll still vote for her.
@PRyan It's not clear...we need to unify. Hilary in any other cycle would have been eliminated from contention already, but GOP divided.
@MuathAlWari @JoeTrippi So the attacks in Iraq that killed Muslims was not an attack on Islam as well?
@RBReich Where has George Soros' money been going? Oh yea, Trump Protestors, Black Lives Matter thugs, Occupy Wall St...Hilary Clinton!
@timkaine If they're too dangerous to fly, why are they here?
@FoxNews @HowardKurtz Media writes narrative 4 Hilary. Trump is contrarian, but train wreck is their story. Ted Cruz was better candidate.
@timkaine Then let people arm themselves to take down the killers before they have a chance to slaughter.
@igorvolsky @LeslieMarshall @ChrisMurphyCT Guns didn't kill anyone you ignorant fools. I guess your keyboard typed your tweet?
@LeslieMarshall Btw, I have a BA in Islamic Studies and a Minor in Mid East History...don't lecture me on Islamic History.
@LeslieMarshall You missed point, no one spoke out against Radical Islamists b4 911 but it still happened. Speech won't change their hate.
@LeslieMarshall @realDonaldTrump So what? Stop calling it what it is? don't recall the anti-Muslim sentiment b4 9/11...but they came 4 us.
@LeslieMarshall In this country, but take a gander all over the world to see what group is more dangerous for that community.
@davidaxelrod Journalist, spinster for a leftist reject, unqualified to be President...yeah, sounds about the same to me.
@LeslieMarshall Does it mean they are automatically registered for jury duty, too?
@Bernies_wake You should come out of fantasy land.
@SenFeinstein When will you follow Boxer's footsteps and retire! You were full of lies the other day!
@SenatorBoxer @SCOTUSnom Can't wait until you retire! #hypocrite #terriblerepresentative
@davidaxelrod @UChiPolitics Instead, actionable intelligence was obtained thru enhanced interrogation technics. CIA Chiefs confirmed this.
@FoxNews @newtgingrich And Trump will be the most unpopular GOP ever nominated. This from a conservative.
@davidaxelrod And if roles were reversed, you'd be funding an anti-whomever the GOP nominee was campaign. #dontbeahypocrite
@Rich_TandlerCSN Technically, twice. But I won't count trading a single pick down. ;)
@SenSanders Kinda like the DNC who will have Google, Facebook, Amazon on theirs? Oh and George Soros, corrupt unions?
@SenSanders How many billions did Obama lose investing in Solar?
@SenSanders Liar!
@SenSanders By saving up for retirement like most normal people?
@BillMoyersHQ They should be able to sue for the enormous debt being left for them.
@stephenasmith @TheNotoriousMMA @NateDiaz209 Why does jump up matter? He was saying he'd dominate every weight class! KTFO!!!
@Realrclark25 @ufc I was expecting it. McGregor is overhyped because he's a loudmouth!
@SenSanders What about the communications companies? Warner/Comcast/Verizon? you pick on banks, what about them? Trust busters unite!
@SenSanders What do you consider poverty? Because 20% poverty rate for children In America is a lie.
@LeslieMarshall @Im4Trump2016 Hilary can't handle it! He didn't say any woman can't...just Hilary!
@LeslieMarshall At what point will you finally see that Obama's giving lip service when he says he wants to debate. Remember ACA debate?
@LeslieMarshall @billclinton @realDonaldTrump What? Sexism and predatory behavior should get over looked?
@SuzanneThayer @greggutfeld She often wines.
@SenSanders Not as much as the greed of big government.
@DineshDSouza Why on earthy would you lie about something so innocuous?
@FoxNews These guys were saved from a recycling plant, here in Maryland. https://t.co/uRb7zAlDlY
@BrentBozell Yup, Trump and Bush were less inclined, but did a little early. Cruz Rubio came across petulant at times.
@LaurenJune89 I would have taken his place...sheesh!
@SenSanders So you won't support Hilary when she beats you in the primaries?
@ChrisThompson_4 Go Noles!
@notthefakeSVP Go Noles!
@ShannonBream It's over! We won! Go Noles #dalvincookshouldwinheismantrophy
@ShannonBream Ugh! This does not feel good! Go Noles!
@megynkelly There has been a sighting of Hilary and Trump together. https://t.co/W76W0RxoJ5
@TheEllenShow There has been a Hilary and Trump sighting. https://t.co/uPOZiLQn1M
@foxandfriends Halloween is here and Trump and Hilary have been seen together. https://t.co/zYOKvWbDmH
@krauthammer Any documents on Lerner will be destroyed before Obama leaves office. No chance of conviction with a new GOP President.
@FoxNews He is being excoriated by the left for that statement.
RT @DavidLimbaugh: WE should not be the country with the highest childhood poverty, but I’ll be damned if I’ll admit a Dem in office is exa…
@THEHermanCain She doesn't want him releasing the criminal emails.
@perrybaconjr @meetthepress She is doing her best to keep him from releasing the criminal emails.
@DLoesch But seemed to recover with her talking point...Evil GOP hates women! PP is greaaaaaaaaaaat! It's laughable!
@jmartNYT @rickklein You mean the same way a young Senator from Chicago did 8 years ago? Hypocrites!
@Niles_Paul84 Get healed, we'll see you next year.
@marklevinshow Another voting block for the DNC...of course they will allow them into our country.
@BobLucidoTeam #noselfies #babyisadorable http://t.co/gpkFmEbPYm
@madannie100 Edgar was ranked #1...Mendes #3 before Aldo was dropped. Get your facts straight dickhead! They changed rankings before fight.
@madannie100 Mendes the hardest puncher?
@Billy_el_flaco I don't disagree,  I think he was hurt by early body kick,  but after the choke attempt, he was done.
@madannie100 against a lesser ranked opponent. Edgar and Aldo are the class of that weight, Mendes is good, but out of their depth.
@LeslieMarshall You don't deserve that...you're wrong often ;) but I have always found you to be thoughtful.
@ShowtimeRHEC I said it's a start. Problem is the hype...his antics got him a title fight over someone who deserved it more, Frankie Edgar.
@justinraheem23 You sir are a real douche bag, aren't you?
@ShowtimeRHEC @Realrclark25 Well...it's a start to have beaten a top 10 fighter for once.  If he beats Aldo or Edgar, I will give him credit
@Realrclark25 Edgar will take him to the ground easier, and has a much better motor. Mendes could not avoid Macgregor. Edgar will.
@JayGlazer In fact...Edgar should've gotten his rematch before MacGregor. MacGregor should have been made to fight Mendes before title shot.
@JayGlazer Aldo or Edgar will punish him.
@Realrclark25 Jose Aldo &amp; Frankie Edgar both will punish him. This should've been fight to earn him a title fight...not talking trash.
@SenSanders No...you sir are the extremist.
@BillMoyersHQ Why do you hate America so much? Maybe you should just move to Europe or better yet, somewhere in the Middle East.
@KatiePavlich Umm...this is not a phenomenon limited to millennial boys. Nothing new here...boys will be boys. Haha!
@nytimes No one is denying the difficulty in staying home w/ kids, but, the luxury lies in the benefits to our children. It is a luxury!
@stephenasmith Yeah, the problem with this fight is Mayweather agreed to fight Manny when he was on the downward spiral of his career.
@AndreaTantaros How can you not RT this vid?	https://t.co/KiuSsJzNKP
@JsteelznSkins Just one bank breaker?
@mkhammer Ha! Worst part was she was with my mother in law!
@jasoninthehouse Ha! I bet you run back to the dry mountain air in late August crying about the suffocating heat!
@IngrahamAngle Tells a lot about our society...Obama gets pass for the last 10 yrs in the public eye after some of his doozies. Ideologues.
@netanyahu Good thing you saw their tactics at work over the past 2 US Presidential elections...defeat them !
@RepMcKinley @FFRNewsNet1 How can he? He thinks negotiations with them is a viable option.
@RGIII Shouldn't you be studying the play book and rehabbing that ankle you shouldn't have been playing on last season?
I still cannot swallow the lack of attention being brought to the mugging by Seattle on Gronk in scuffle to end game. Gang mentality!
@JRubinBlogger Should I vaccinate my infant child for an STD?
@garymyersNYDN @thomloverro On this we agree.
@garymyersNYDN @thomloverro Worse than fielding shady players @ USC? You know...the ones that put program on probation b4 he rolled out.
@garymyersNYDN @thomloverro How can you say that? The fight to end the game gets washed under the rug after year of anti violence in NFL?
@BrockESPN @thomloverro Thank God it didn't happen. Lynch MVP? OK. Russell Top 3? No! Carroll? Escaped cheating scandal w/ Belichik n SB.
@NBCdianna Does that mean Fangio is coming to DC?
@nytimes So if they aren't tipped to their liking, do you get a poor rating?
@LeslieMarshall By reduces, you mean the amount added to defecit is reduced from 1 trillion a yeat to 800 billion? That kind of reduction?
@Bullitino @greggutfeld @ericbolling Wrong...can still get it. Vaccines just reduce the chance of infection. Drastically, but only reduces.
@BretBaier @JamesRosenFNC Where does it end? Should my infant child be vaccinated for STD's? Be more specific.
@LeslieMarshall My pre-school is free. Wife and I agreed she'd stay home. Lost income not worth the cost of someone else rasing our kids.
@LeslieMarshall How much more do we invest? Problem is how that money, already invested, is spent.
@adbrandt @rickklein And what will NFL do about the way Gronkowski was attacked by at least 4 different Seahags' players in the brawl?
@AndreaTantaros You keep clamoring against cheaters so you choose Seadderall? You follow Pete Carroll's career over the past 10 years?
@JayGlazer Just getting started, you know media at SB will be plastering this all over the interwebz.
@Rachel__Nichols Actually, he said he has never touched one...tried to correct by saying unless it bounced toward in the process of a play.
@JsteelznSkins So...Vic gonna get Gruden money? Gruden see this as an affront? Can they co-exist? Wasn't Barry, Gruden's guy? ANSWERS! Haha!
@TMZ Didn't his ex knock it out with the golf club? Isn't tha why he disappeared for a month after the incident?
@Russellmania980 @thomloverro @RGIII WHO CARES!?!?!?!?!?!?!
@granthpaulsen You been in that stadium? They are the most classless of the many NFL stadiums I've been to. Classless is too nice.
@KatiePavlich In many cases, agreed. But if he gets ignored, he gets no press.
@KatiePavlich Saw his words, 1st reaction...tell him the piece of trash he is...realized, not worth it. He's worthless &amp; becoming a memory.
@RapSheet Where is Joe Barry going to end up?
@john_keim Haha! Tough crowd today?
@BGObsession Shut yer pie holes!
@AlGaldi Musta read that wrong, sounded like Cooley was laughing it off. Just hope he can bring the same success here he had out west.
@BGObsession Yeah, but still very skeptical. Just kinda numb mostly. Haha! Great marketing move by the owner about to lose fanbase.
@BGObsession Thinking Smith coordinated this so he doesn't have to have increased role.
@AlGaldi Remember last week I called u and Cooley and said Dan needs to fire up jet &amp; fly to Wash to get this man, you guys laughed it off?
@HogsHaven Please, no!
@TampaHeadhunter He's done. He will never get the nomination for the GOP Presidential candidate. He lost VA, NY, MI, and WI.
@TarikCSN Called Galdi Cooley last week - told them this is exactly who Skins need. They had no idea who I was talking about. Do it Dan!
@john_keim Please don't insult me. Break a rule it's cheating. Ur clinging to "Romo made the play happen" DE not held no TD. Yes, cheating.
@greta @BretBaier Lost my support seeing him so giddy in Jones' box.
@john_keim No TD if the OT didn't cheat. Romo would have been sacked. Go review it again, Smith held giving Romo the time to throw it.
@IngrahamAngle Well, after seeing Chris Christie in the owner's box cheering for Dallas, I am done with him. He's from Jersey!
@john_keim Did you see the hold on Tryon Smith?
@ClaytonESPN Has nothing to do with the defensive pressure they're putting on him, huh? Go sell your potions elsewhere!
@BillKristol Always the victim.
@HollyRFisher Haha! Sounds like Redskins' fans w/Haslett...thank God he doesn't! Lewis? Win here or he's done. Tired of the same in Cincy
@DLoesch Al Sharpton is running for President?
@AdamSchefter Shanahan gets the job in Buffalo Schwartz won't be there long. Shanahan will hire Haslett to destroy defense in Buffalo. Haha!
@ChrisThompson_4 He'll come back for one more year. He needs to mature.
@MikeSilver No! Tell us now! Hahaha!
@MikeEmanuelFox Was anyone trying to get married while you played through?
@johndonaldsonjr Cheatin on me?&gt;
@HollyRFisher Best we're ever gonna see from him. http://t.co/1Xl1Jbnf6I
@john_keim I like Roderick's thinking but Scot McCloughan is the guy I would throw top dollar at to get him here.
@KatiePavlich Yup...taking advantage of his pulpit to push skewed statistics.
@granthpaulsen Yeah, you could be a little less obvious. How about FSU offensive power?
@ShannonBream Excuse me Ms. Breem, but Noles should not be the after thought. Go Noles!
@kevins980 @RGIII Just throw a catchable ball. Can we get idea of him running out of our heads and hold him accountable for making passes!
@KeenanRobinson1 All around team loss K! You guys played well, wish the coaching staff let you put more pressure on the rookie.
@blackrepublican Fundamentally transform this country...to what?
@TarikCSN Don't want to hear that...want to see that pass completed to Garcon!
@ffweekend @FoxNews http://t.co/OSQc7afIPv
@ChaseMinnifield @ChrisThompson_4 Umm...No! Go Noles!
@maddow Sure we have...he sits in the Oval Office daily.
@kevins980 if you like that much scoring, sure. Just line them up and perform offense drills w/ no team on the other side. *sarcasm alert*
@thomloverro Haha!
@thomloverro t-what?
@thomloverro Yeah, I see no coming back from a loss tonight.
@john_keim I have seen some of the growth you mention, but 3 times this year in less than 3 games penalized for personal fouls.
@john_keim His leadership is what has been lacking. His jawing at the refs after many plays is not leadership. Every game this season.
@Niles_Paul84 http://t.co/KfrmWC7889
@ShannonBream GO NOLES!
@RGIII http://t.co/5Zo7QFFKeh
@PierreGarcon http://t.co/ckX1yq5FHk
@LeslieMarshall Mexico! They encourage stream of immigrants so they can send US $ back to Mexico! Let's impose sanctions! They'll change!
@LeslieMarshall Sure it would help those here...there would be more hands on deck to help!
@LeslieMarshall he didnt say photo op not gonna solve problem! He said not interested in them...ITS NOT A PHOTO OP! Its what leaders do!
@Trey_Deuces http://t.co/jlOfiTexp9
@LeslieMarshall As comfortable as the Unions having so much influence on the left. You're smarter than to buy into Reid's propaganda.
@JedediahBila Oh so close!
@granthpaulsen WHY?!?!?! With the expected talent in the UDFA this year, wth is another 7th really worth?
@TMurphy_93 Welcome aboard!
@JsteelznSkins OLB? Don't we have more pressing needs?
@granthpaulsen So who is willing to trade up having the night to think about who is available.
@JsteelznSkins Was hopping he could somehow fall to us...
@JsteelznSkins Is that a joint on your seat or are you just happy to...
@AdamCarriker94 Cowboys in the 2nd round.
@czabe What if? Haha! You kinda sound like Mel Kiper all goo goo over Jimmy Clausen!
@granthpaulsen Give Locker a little time in the pocket he may be that qb...if he can stay healthy.
@granthpaulsen Yes!
@tomcblock @john_keim Did someone say Tanard?
@DLoesch Meh...women should be pregnant, barefoot and in the kicthen...with a gun! LOL!
@JulieBanderas I think this one is better. That's my boy! http://t.co/pCewBlOlqU
@JsteelznSkins Tanard Jackson gets a 4 year $24 million contract extension!
@john_keim Tanard Jackson! Haha!
@LeslieMarshall Young Americans...he needs them to sign up!
@kevins980 No! Hopefully it means we are pairing him with his former teammate...Alex Mack. Haha!
@THEHermanCain @BestofCain Agree with sentiment, but imposing on residence is wrong. Go to office. Don't like this tactic from either side.
@WashTimes Umm...who is editing the tweets? What is "Comast"-Time Warner?
@RyanKerrigan91 The pre-workout mix was a giant milkshake with Breyers Vanilla ice cream and 10 sets was all I could do...
@LeslieMarshall Then why has the disparity grown under his leadership?
@granthpaulsen Umm...butter! Just give me a stick and I will eat it!
@marklevinshow Whoever's bright idea it is to offer a health care plan to replace ACA is who will cost the GOP Senate. What r they thinking?
@newtgingrich Yes! Most important issue. First thing I want to know when researching candidate is are they pro-life.
@GretchenCarlson @BretBaier They need to refrain from introducing anything new that Obama and his minions can shift focus toward.
@GretchenCarlson @BretBaier Ephasize failures of Obama...Benghazi, IRS &amp; ACA scandals. Flood media with Obama quotes. U can keep your HC!!!
@PierreGarcon Travesty! You deserved it!
@nprpolitics She vilifies Abbott blaming him and questions his ability to overcome...umm, he's the Attorney General and he's a paraplegic!
@DRUDGE_REPORT Better alternative than margarine...
@McShay13 Any of the DT's project early 2nd?
@ainsleyearhardt You just finish celebrating our Seminoles winning the National Championship?
@lindsayczarniak Just being classless like fans who threw objects at Bowman being carted off field. Fans, players and coach...classless!
@RickDocWalker More like poor tackling.
@FoxNews What will the Unions have to say about this?
@ClaytonESPN Can I ask why there was no call on the defenseless player? He clearly went head hunting on that tackle. Fumble negate hit?
@AlbertBreer Yup! That FG by Fox in the 1st half instead of going for 2 was a smart call. Take the points.
@lindsayczarniak Can you ask him about class? This is the same Golden Tate I witnessed spit on a fan at Redskins' playoff game last year.
@AlbertBreer Like it gets in the way of your reporting... LOL!
@brithume TD drive to end 1st half saw 2 blatant penalties not called for the 49ers. Call head butt for 1 gotta call for all.
@Niles_Paul84 Right...because Boldin won't get called for it.
@thomloverro Haha! I am glad I figured out interwebz sarcasm.
@greggutfeld You're watching football!
@greggutfeld Aww...
@brithume He doesn't get much. Worst announcer for NFL football...
@RickDocWalker Time for pup to truly cement a legacy. Last week was first step. Only chance Colts have is Mathis in Brady's face!
@greggutfeld Someone desperate for ratings? LOL!
@AlbertBreer Well finally, I agree with you on something. Player on opposite side of field was in front of play but field was wide open.
@LindsayFox5 Looked like that play was drawn up, WR on opposite side was in front of play. Bad throw Colston. Field was open on that side.
@RickDocWalker Looked like they had a play drawn up, WR on opposite side was in front of the play. Bad throw from Colston.
@KirkCousins8 Poor play calling. They didn't run it enough early.
@AdamCarriker94 @onemangang97 Go Noles!
@ShannonBream GO NOLES!
@CurtDooley @BreitbartNews You sure about that? The NY Times is counting on it too with their Benghazi report.
@newtgingrich NFL grandfathered Packers' ownership setup. NFL banned stockholder ownership. Some historian u r! ;)
@mattmcnichols15 @ShannonBream Go Noles!
@NQS88 @B_in_DC @JsteelznSkins After I witnessed Golden Tate spit on a Skins' fan a couple of seats away from me in playoffs..no!
@JsteelznSkins Would rather have a younger Pat Angerer for less.
OK...I would prefer they bring in new blood. But we shall see why many are enamored by Morrocco and Scott.
@JsteelznSkins Is that a bad thing?
@JsteelznSkins Thank God!
@JsteelznSkins So what is up with Allen?
@AlbertBreer Not knocking, but Shanny was VP...that is FO so of course there would be changes in FO with the VP being fired.
@Niles_Paul84 Meh...he's passionate. Keep up hard work and come back for the new coach. Your play is a bright spot in a misrable season.
@JsteelznSkins Allen stuff?
@Rich_Campbell Poor officiating all around the NFL all season long. In most cases it seemed one team was always singled out during game.
@granthpaulsen Who would you hire as GM? I would go with Scot McLoughlan, Eric DeCosta or Scott Pioli.
@HTTR24_7 Please don't even joke about that...
@JsteelznSkins I guess not.
@JsteelznSkins Wouldn't it be Nassib?
@davidaxelrod Throw more money at school system that is funded greater than any other developed nation on earth? And is among worst?
@LindsayFox5 Yup! One of the reasons I was not a fan of benching Griff. Possible trade partners get a glimpse of avg Cousins.
@tedcruz Stop rocking GOP boat over next 10 months, Harry Reid gets ousted as Sen Maj Leader!  DNC pays in Nov! Chance to repeal ACA in '15!
@RickDocWalker Yeah, but it was because they stopped rushing 5 or more. It was 4 man only rush every play in the 4th.
@darrellgreen28 Yeah, too bad the DC couldn't call a single blitz at the end of the game. Soft zone with game on the line killed us!
@ShannonBream Let's hope they only sell Duck Commander so A&amp;E gets no revenue from them anymore.
@IngrahamAngle Why on earth were you watching that trash in the 1st place?
@davidaxelrod I revel the day you become a bookmark in history and people wake up to the lying scumbag you are!
@davidaxelrod BS! Your incessant lying about Romney was the downfall since the overwhelming populace too stupid to wade though your BS!
@RasmussenPoll I just don't understand how anyone could give him anything but poor marks!
@FoxNews Nope! GW throwing the first pitch (A Strike!) at Yankee Stadium after 9/11...
@andersoncooper Is it the decibel level or the content of the discussion that irks you?
@ericbolling Right back at ya!
@TKextremeskins Haha! Rick, next time I will be sure to ask you specifically to participate in a group photo...ok?
@TKextremeskins  Stop! U saw I was gathering crew for image and ran off. U acted scared of the camera and you know it. U can't hide truth.
@TKextremeskins Not then, when Pez was slicing the Pork. Didn't specifically ask u, was starting to gather the crew for shot, u ran off.
@TKextremeskins I tried to get a group photo of w/ you standing right there. You ran off when I was trying to get everyone together.
@TKextremeskins Ha! Go ahead w/ ur usual tactics...try to impugn me all you want. You won't pose for pics...why? Something to hide?
@HTTR24_7 Using a Nikon D700 for that... here's a great shot of Pez and Huly. http://t.co/tkl82nUD15
@TKextremeskins @HTTR24_7 Attend event I have been asked to photograph and call me stalker when I post your pic? OK http://t.co/mUeCZDHb7p
@HTTR24_7 Laughable...

@TeamCavuto It should only further his disconnect with the people. The Public won't stand for it while he funds Egypt w/ $250 million.
@HTTR24_7 Amazing how "sports writers" don't do their homework! Healthy, he is fine. We just need an upgrade from Madieau...
@michellemalkin What better way to manipulate the masses!
@nprpolitics Current system is fine! We've had 3 Presidents in a row who were not quality leaders...the latest being the worst of the bunch!
@IngrahamAngle @gretawire Well, since the market for the Olympics seems to be geared toward women...
@LindsayFox5 Gotta agree with ya Murph. Frankie scores enough to win another fight and it's taken from him. He beat Benson and now Aldo.
@JayGlazer Alistair got complacent. He lost, Big Foot did not win...
@LeslieMarshall What about enjoying a sporting event without divisiveness?
@LeslieMarshall You just don't get it. 2nd Amend about saving us from any threat...tyrannical gov included, however unlikely that threat is.
@ShannonBream @FoxNews Was this person in Iran on personal or government biz? Personal? Nothing since ban on travel to Iran...
@davidaxelrod Like the millions in donations your candidate received from those anonymous gift cards?
@LeslieMarshall Well, what happens when they become POW's in countries that still stone women to death?
@DRUDGE_REPORT If he'd had a gun, he would have been able to defend himself...
@LeslieMarshall Nope, but it gives you liberals an excuse to push your agenda. Way to exploit tragedy!

http://t.co/duzXKkjZ
@LindsayFox5 Haha!
@kevins980 Exaclty! It was the first series of the game they did not run the ball on 1st down every time...
@HTTR24_7 Spencer-good against run, and great at pass rush but nowhere near as good as Kerrigan in coverage. All phases, Kerrigan.
@HTTR24_7 Kerrigan in the 3-4 because he is the best all-around player. You want pass rush only, go with one of the others.
@HTTR24_7 Probably?
@LFletcher59 trey deuces should be going with you... Congratulations!
@RickDocWalker You mean holding Roddy White that wasn't called. PI...no, holding...yes!
@Rich_Campbell Nolan easing up pressure after Kapernick running for his life in 1st 1/4. Why didn't they rush everyone to block that punt?
@Rich_Campbell Gotta disagree. Coaching for the Falcons lost them that game. Arrogance of Smith to burn off clock before he got points...
@RickDocWalker About the most realistic statement made all day. Tired of Buck and his love affair with the media darlings in the NFL...
@HTTR24_7 @AJtheFan Honey Badger won't go until probably 3rd...maybe 4th round so Te'o
@LindsayFox5 @KirkCousins8 It those golden locks that are gone! No one recognizes you now!
@Rich_Campbell That's because he had the surgery today...or will be having it tomorrow. He will not leave Florida without having the surgery
@Niles_Paul84 Thank you!. I follow the team very closely...i.e, almost all home games, training camp. I appreciate players like you!
@Niles_Paul84 HTTR!!! http://t.co/uw1p1xEw

@TwitchyTeam Who else did they think would pay for it?
@davidaxelrod Kudos! U r 1 of the best politicians I have ever seen. U &amp; Rove raise the standard, even if I don't like ur political vision.
@RickDocWalker Hey Dan! Fire Haslett! Mike won't do it!~
@GovChristie Yeah BS!!! You're #1 goal is to get in the photo ops! A re-elected, O laughs at you!
@MonicaCrowley It's lost. No way of turning this ship around.
@SpeakerBoehner No they don't! Last night they voted for more free stuff! This country is lost. I am no longer proud to be an American.
@oreillyfactor I loathe Chris Matthews, but he was not UNHINGED! I am emailing O'Reilly to tell him about this tweet! Disingenuous at best!
@GovChristie would you get your nose out of his ass already!
@IngrahamAngle This is the catalyst that puts Obama over the top. Mark it! Shame on Christie for offering Obama the stump!
@GovChristie Who woulda thunk Bloomberg made the right decision to disallow Obama the stump for his re-election! Shame on you!
@ShannonBream Obama will give executive order to postpone election so people who can't get out the opportunity to "Get out the Vote!"

@RickDocWalker You neglect Carriker's presence too...

@LFletcher59 I hope it didn't take everything! You have 15 more to go... Great goal line defense against Sproles!

@davidaxelrod DEBACLE of putting the health care system in the hands of bureaucrats!
@DickMorrisTweet That single contradiction is going to haunt the GOP in days to come...
@LeslieMarshall  Obama campaign has created this issue so it will detract from the fact women hurt most by poor economy.
@DRUDGE_REPORT But if the shooter had killed more people, the outcries would be, "Why didn't cops do more?"
@AnnCoulter Yeah, Chicago too!
@jim_newell Ha! I bet you never asked Obama for his!
@maddow Did he ever mention the word "lazy" or is that an inference you pose with this tweet?
@michellemalkin is there anyway you can organize a protest of Biden a.l.a. the blocking of Westboro Scumbags? Taunt him in Tampa!
@michellemalkin You have a huge following of Conservative minded people. Can you organize a rally of GOP's to meet Biden and heckle him?
@MonicaCrowley Romney's fault for answering the question about his returns yesterday. He can't play into their hands! He needs to be wiser!
@davidaxelrod Stretching the truth a little there...again!
@davidaxelrod Keystone!
@davidaxelrod How about Biden's comments in Danville, VA?
@ezraklein Let's hope he cuts about 10k Federal jobs as well!
@davidaxelrod Hahahaha! I cannot believe you're still crying about this after what Bill Burton did! Shameful! You and DWS sh'd get together.
@davidaxelrod Are you defending your...er...umm...Priorities Super Pac ad?
RT @AriFleischer: @PaulRyanVP is already up to 33k followers. RT this and give him a follow.
@maddow You're gay?
@davidaxelrod Ryan Budget votes in Senate: 41 Yes votes, 58 No votes. Obama Budget votes in Senate: 0 Yes, 99 No. Who's budget is extreme?
@kevins980 Can't disagree with most of it except Banks @ WE. He is too small to be a WR in the NFL. Bills game exposed it.
@maddow Haha! You think Joe Biden is?
@Rich_Campbell No, he's looking out for the rookie, which is good. You could see he was led just a little too much.
@davidaxelrod http://t.co/etGzArse
@Kimsfirst yesterday
@Niles_Paul84 As it should be.
@nprpolitics What do you tell the 40k who lost their jobs in July? Are they part of the status quo?
@davidaxelrod 8.3%
@marcorubio But no Senator...it's 8.254%. I swear this administration could dress up a pig and...well...you know what I am saying.
@LeslieMarshall Yeah, I boycott reading your articles because you twist the truth to fit your liberal ideology. Haha!
@davidaxelrod You mean the job creators you're holding back, keeping unemployment above 8% for record length of time?
@michellemalkin Yeah well, you can thank Sarah Palin and her lack of experience in Washington politics for this! Sharon Angle?
@davidaxelrod Whereas Obama would choose to give Billions of tax dollars to green energy companies that fail!

@davidaxelrod Why? It's the truth! That's why he wanted to "fundamentally" change it!
@davidaxelrod And what they'll find is charitable giving that equals more in one year than Obama has ever given!
@davidaxelrod Not nearly as bad as you getting embarrassed in Boston!
@SeanHannityFOX Watched your show tonight and wondered...you didn't ask Juan, "Who signed off if we have all documents?" Who was in CHARGE?
@seanhannity Carney said they gave all documents pertaining to F&amp;F mission. Well then, who signed off on it!!?!?!?!?!?!?! Who was in charge?
@seanhannity Watched your show tonight and wondered why you didn't ask Juan, "Who signed off if we have all documents?"

@davidaxelrod Great job at deflecting from reality, but it isn't going to work in '12. You're man is in trouble! The People spoke in WI
@davidaxelrod George Soros!
@PressSec @gardenofthegods You mean the permits that were signed by Bush finally came to fruition? Blame Bush for bad, take credit for good?
@PressSec @DorothyStJames And even those in his own party would not entertain these foolish ideas!
@davidaxelrod Small businesses uncertain about how Obama would take money from them started to lay people off after election day 2008.
@davidaxelrod But you say nothing about the money George Soros spends to spread your liberal failures!
@davidaxelrod Yesterday you said the crowd couldn't handle the truth. You can't tell the truth! Less jobs than when Obama took office!
@KirkCousins8 Glad to have you aboard! We know it's not your ideal situation, but glad you're here for at least 4 years. HTTR!
@davidaxelrod Haha! How ironic! The best twister of facts, possibly ever wants to discuss "mashing" of facts!
@davidaxelrod So, how do you feel about George Soros?
@davidaxelrod What about the nearly 80% of the companies Bain helped? What about jobs saved or created with those 80% Bain kept afloat?
@davidaxelrod Liar! Less people working in country today than when Obama took office! You don't get it!
@BigPoppaPump94 Aaahh... But if the rock is hidden under the paper, how will you find it?
@charliesheen That was horrible!
@AdamSchefter Actually, it is likely 4 rookie QB's. It all depends on Tannehill's development. Weeden, RG3 and Luck all start day 1.
@HankTime85 Your chances of becoming an All-Pro now that you have a potential great throwing you the ball!
@HogsHaven you select him! Especially in the 3rd. Just like Burfict, if he is available in the 7th, you take him. London will school 'em.
@FoxNews The Rangers are the ones who should be vilified. The boy needs to learn that he can't always get what he wants!
Will the Colts land Coby Fleener for Luck?
@jaimiegraham Ha! I probably saw it 25 times before some of them were born. LOL!
@MittRomney Sir, I am behind you! Please don't hesitate to play the dirty game Obama will play. John McCain lost 'cause he wouldn't!
@JayGlazer Come on man! Lyoto made Rashad look stupid! Rashad will go after Jones and get caught in a submission. He's too aggressive.
@RGIII Yes! You are about to become the face of a franchise, the more professional you look, the better. Oh and Congrats on the engagement!
@MelKiperESPN Come on man, I watched u 2. You were smoking from the ears angry at him because he said Claussen wan't a 1st round pick!
@MelKiperESPN yeah, ordinarily I would give one a break, but you sat there yelling at McShay about it when he disagreed! Apologize 2 him?
@MelKiperESPN Only difference is they know how to evaluate those players! Jimmy Claussen!
@MelKiperESPN Hey, how's Jimmy Claussen doing?
@TKextremeskins Haha! You are nothing more than a Jason LaConfora wannabe!
So glad to see the Sweet Swine Pork Rinds scumbag didn't win the MD Lotto ticket! Group of teachers win and say they will continue teaching.
@jaimiegraham Well, since they can't make it out of the first round after winning the President's Cup...logic would dictate they win it all.
@jaimiegraham I am clueless. I will get the hang of it.
@jaimiegraham You don't jus simply reply?
@marklevinshow But according to her, she was talking about the downtrodden,not her. Haha! What a joke!
