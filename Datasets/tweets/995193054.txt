Selma, AL has a special place in my heart. I was born here, and it’s also where my friend &amp; civil rights hero @RepJohnLewis &amp; other activists crossed the Edmund Pettus Bridge while facing brutal opposition to their peaceful pursuit for civil rights. https://t.co/kvV7UnpL8o

This is case-in-point why we need strong consumer privacy legislation. One thing my bill would do is require companies to write their private policies in plain English and explain exactly how and with whom their private data will be shared. https://t.co/B4I5RBusH8
Background checks on gun sales only work if they’re actually completed. Today we passed #HR1112 to close the #CharlestonLoophole by extending the initial FBI background check review from 3 to 10 business days.

If Trump wants comprehensive immigration reform, he needs to work with Congress. Declaring a national emergency to build his ill-conceived border wall is reckless, undermines our rule of law, and sets a dangerous precedent.
It’s not just wages that are stagnating, families are struggling to keep up with rising housing costs and health care bills. The middle class is the backbone of our economy and I will keep pushing for policies that strengthen and expand our middle class. https://t.co/63ZVEsl56f

I remember the horrors of the tragic landslide near Oso in 2014 which took 43 precious lives. It was one of my saddest days in Congress. This tragedy highlighted the need to invest in technology &amp; land mapping to prevent future natural disasters from becoming national tragedies.
One year ago, these 17 beautiful souls lost their lives at the #ParklandSchoolShooting. We remember them, and honor them, by continuing to fight for commonsense gun laws to prevent these senseless tragedies. #NotOneMore #EndGunViolence https://t.co/QiRTthd1DN

Today I joined my colleagues in reintroducing the Assault Weapons Ban. Tomorrow is the anniversary of the Parkland shooting, and no bills have passed to address the nearly 1,200 gun-related deaths since that tragic day. We must enact common sense gun safety legislation now.

For many Americans, access to affordable prescription drugs is the difference between life &amp; death. Congress must work to ensure medicine is accessible &amp; affordable.

So sad about the passing of Congressman John Dingell. He leaves an incredible legacy after almost 60 years serving in the House.

To remedy this, she founded @SkillSpire2016, which is committed to strengthening the STEM pipeline for underrepresented #WA communities. I'm thrilled to have her join me at the #SOTU, and to celebrate the contributions immigrants make to our society.
Yasmin helped establish &amp; still volunteers for the Muslim Association of Puget Sound (MAPS), starting a night school that has served over 1000 Muslim students. While at MAPS, she found students who wanted to work in the IT industry but who lacked the training &amp; resources.

An important victory, but we still have a long way to go. No one has the right to interfere with women’s private health decisions. https://t.co/5yo2kyZuAI
This hurts the entire country and it doesn’t need to happen. The president must end this shutdown now.
It’s Day 24 of the #TrumpShutdown and so many families are suffering the consequences. Recently I met with #WA01 housing agencies, transportation providers and small businesses who are also impacted.
Today, we honor Korean-Americans across the country and reflect on their tremendous contributions to our society. I am proud to represent the #PNW, a region with rich diversity and a thriving #KoreanAmerican population.
Needless to say, people are worried and want the government to reopen quickly. I implore the president to heed this advice and reopen our government. Too much is at stake for hardworking families and small businesses.
The #TrumpShutdown is causing anxiety throughout #WA01. Today I met with @MyCommTrans, @UWBGov, HASCO, and Tethers Unlimited to better learn how folks are being affected by the shutdown. https://t.co/JLn3oUhZkv
#WA01 residents – keep up what I’m doing in the “other Washington” by following me on Instagram and Facebook! Search for me using @RepDelBene! https://t.co/MDz9T4vjpW
Great to see my alma mater develop a potentially life-saving app. Using innovative technology could be a promising step in preventing opioid overdoses in #WA. https://t.co/HAyQvLHyfM
To sustain economic growth, companies must have a strong talent pool. Trump’s anti-immigrant policies drive away talented workers. Immigrants helped make the US the greatest country in the world. We must make comprehensive immigration reform a top priority.https://t.co/sNgeJ5vsCO
They protect our skies, secure our borders, inspect our food, help our farmers &amp; perform countless other duties that keep our country strong. Today they’ll wonder how to pay rent or put food on the table. It’s a sad day. Mr. President, open the government. https://t.co/vmSlRveDqv
Happy to speak at the @WomensHighTech Coalition Welcome Reception last night. I look forward to advancing our agenda, and with a record number of women in Congress, increasing our membership! @SusanWBrooks @RepAnnaEshoo https://t.co/nUVD96U3zd
Worker paychecks, housing benefits, and infrastructure funding. These are just some of the ways the shutdown is impacting #WA residents. Trump needs to reopen the government. https://t.co/6UivUmM3i3
I can’t think of anything more hurtful for the men and women who defend our great country. They protect our freedoms. We should protect their livelihoods. If the president is serious about protecting the homeland he would do his job and reopen the government. https://t.co/bdq4w9ji5m
Here’s a prime example of the #TrumpShutdown hitting home. On top of impacting #WA federal workers, the shutdown could also stifle local economic growth. https://t.co/A7B4BF7oI1
As more information is revealed about the Trump’s campaign’s relationship with the Russians, it makes protecting the Mueller investigation that much more imperative. The American people deserve the facts. https://t.co/uwgMDN3afM
Presidential addresses are meant to discuss critical issues at our nation's forefront. Instead, Trump used it to stoke fear &amp; mislead the public. The President needs to do his job &amp; stop holding our government hostage over an ill conceived border wall. https://t.co/ONH6CZKBx1
This is what happens when our own president calls climate change a “hoax.” We can’t afford not to #ActonClimate. Future generations depend on the actions that we take today. https://t.co/6vav1IQmdz

97% of gun owners supports universal background checks. I’m pleased this bipartisan legislation is being introduced today in the House in the hopes of saving innocent lives from senseless gun violence. https://t.co/4OJIeAMgq4
#WA workers and their families shouldn’t have to miss a paycheck because the president is unwilling to back down from his demands. @HouseDemocrats have moved bills to open up the government &amp; continue negotiations. The president needs to stop being reckless and come to the table. https://t.co/ulEdn6Bvln
My privacy bill would have consumers opt in before companies can access their private data, and would require companies to disclose if and with whom data will be shared. We deserve transparency. I’ll keep working to get my bill passed this Congress. https://t.co/6WSeZ0r2RD
We’re not just talking about “food stamps.” This is about ensuring families in search of work have access to good, nutritious meals and that children don’t go to school on empty stomachs. Anything less is unacceptable. https://t.co/GxKydbaLf1
Yet another outrageous proposal by this administration. This is dangerous thinking that could leave families and children more vulnerable to discrimination in the housing market and at school. https://t.co/vLaOddamcM
The playoffs are here! #GoHawks!!	#SEAvsDAL #Imin
The President should follow @HouseDemocrats example and reopen the government now. At the end of the year the Senate passed the same legislation by unanimous consent. https://t.co/CJnvHbpjLv
The President says he’s fine letting the U.S. economy suffer for ”months or years” over his wasteful, misguided and ineffective border wall. Real leaders don’t negotiate by holding their own government hostage.
I also helped reintroduce the Hold Congress Accountable Act last week. Members of Congress shouldn’t get paid if other federal employees aren’t getting paid.
While President Trump keeps the government closed over his wasteful, immoral border wall, I have decided to donate my salary to the @NWIRP. They do important work keeping immigrant families together while fighting for justice.
This is a great read with important ideas on how we can fight addiction to opioids. Congress passed meaningful legislation last year, but the work continues in the #116thCongress. https://t.co/XOOnCmX1g0

Housing costs are still unaffordable for so many #WA01 families. I have legislation that would increase the Low Income Housing Tax Credit by 50% and expand access to affordable housing. https://t.co/6XqGQy2Riz
@Accenture report: U.S. women in equality-boosting cultures are 42% more likely to advance at work. Companies clearly can make a difference. When we make workplaces safe, tolerant, &amp; flexible #womensucceed and America succeeds. @AdvanceBizWomen https://t.co/UYp8AugACd

If you pass a law (#GOPTaxScam for the rich) that drives up the deficit, don’t insult America’s intelligence by claiming the best way to lower that deficit is to cut Social Security/Medicare/Medicaid for working people. Your agenda is showing. https://t.co/7ctsIWsizh

No, tariffs aren’t “the greatest.” They create uncertainty for American workers and put jobs at risk. My bill would expand TAA to cover workers who lose their jobs when U.S. exports drop due to increased tariffs from foreign countries on American goods.	https://t.co/pEMT8x5rXR

Unfortunately, House Republicans continue to undermine these safeguards. I’ll keep working with my colleagues who want to protect consumers from the kinds of reckless activities that led to the financial crisis and cost so many families their jobs, homes and life savings.
Today is the anniversary of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act being signed into law. This landmark legislation helps protect consumers by monitoring financial systems and identifying risks to economic stability.

This provision is politically motivated and does nothing to improve the quality or affordability of health care. It's solely in this bill to put safe &amp; legal abortion further out of reach, disproportionately affecting women w/low-incomes &amp; women of color. https://t.co/39bXyEre20
In committee today, @WaysandMeansGOP moved a bill that would needlessly take away premium tax credits from millions of hard working Americans struggling to afford their health insurance simply because their plan covers comprehensive women’s health services. #ProtectOurCare

Or Sue from Kenmore. She had already reached three-quarters of her lifetime coverage limit after being diagnosed with stage IV ovarian cancer. But thanks to the #ACA, she no longer faces lifetime limits or insurance discrimination as a cancer survivor. #ProtectOurCare
Take Paul from Snohomish. His son-in-law died from cancer before #ACA b/c he couldn’t afford the care &amp; didn’t have insurance. Paul told me, “The certificate of death states my son-in-law died from cancer, but I believe he died from a broken healthcare system.” #ProtectOurCare

Rather than work with any of the Dems that Trump says are needed to get a bill to his desk, @SpeakerRyan continues to give concessions to the @HouseGOP's anti-immigrant members on a bill they still won’t vote for and the Senate won’t even consider, while kids keep suffering. https://t.co/x9mHMWd3Tb
Remember how @SpeakerRyan and @realdonaldtrump repeatedly said that the #GOPTaxScam would let you file your taxes on a postcard? Well, I guess it’s not a lie if they didn’t say how many postcards. https://t.co/8VBdbK4hMi
Today’s #SCOTUS decisions are disappointments to say the least. Elections have consequences. The @SenateMajLdr played politics and tampered with the Court and real people will be affected by these opinions.
The #SCOTUS decision on Trump’s #travelban is deeply disappointing. It wholly undermines our nation’s history as a bastion of religious freedom. I agree with Justice Sotomayor’s powerful dissent: https://t.co/OIMotdvJ4k
Five years ago the #SCOTUS gutted the Voting Rights Act in Shelby County v Holder. We should be making it easier for Americans to participate in our elections, not allowing states to enact laws that disenfranchise voters. It’s time to #RestoreTheVOTE. https://t.co/twGI2JDMHC
In McAllen, I spoke w/mothers who told me they have no way of contacting their kids &amp; haven't even been told where they're being held. They're scared for their kids’ safety, and so am I, which is why I'll keep demanding answers from the Trump administration. #KeepFamiliesTogether https://t.co/SHuCfEywec

Happy Pride! We've made so much progress in the fight to ensure equal rights for #LGBTQ Americans. Today we celebrate and tomorrow we keep fighting to pass the #EqualityAct so everyone is treated equally under the law, regardless of who they are or who love. #Pride2018
It's time for @SpeakerRyan to stop appeasing Trump’s intolerant and anti-immigrant policies and work across the aisle to so we can come up with a bipartisan deal that keeps families together and provides certainty for #DACA recipients. #protectDREAMers #FamiliesBelongTogether
The Trump administration's continued zeal in pushing their egregious anti-immigrant agenda is inflicting long-term damage on families. I'm in McAllen with my colleagues today to see what's happening with my own eyes and to try to get some answers for these kids and families. https://t.co/TQ4vdHJdPX
I'm pleased the House passed two bipartisan bills I helped introduce to address the #opioids crisis affecting countless individuals and families across my district and the nation. https://t.co/xfdKlOnByg
Too many people are suffering from addiction that started from an opioid prescription when an alternative might have been available, including a gentleman I met who became addicted at age 17 simply because he was prescribed #opioids when he had his wisdom teeth removed.
Big victory as #SCOTUS rules in favor of Americans' right to privacy by requiring a warrant for cell-phone location data. But Congress still must act to update laws like #ECPA and create forward-looking policy that works in today’s innovative and evolving society. https://t.co/y0Z9uP9JY1
There's nothing "phony" about the trauma you’re inflicting on children and families. I'm headed to the border later today to see for myself because I really do care. https://t.co/EENErHolxs
That's why I've offered an amendment to invest in areas with high poverty, unemployment, food insecurity, homelessness and foreclosure rates, so we can build a better future.
But that requires sustained investment, not the #GOPbudget's drastic cuts, in areas that create opportunities for the millions of Americans seeking a better quality of life for themselves and their families.
We need a budget that supports the development of a competitive American workforce to encourage job creation and build an economy that works for all Americans. https://t.co/9Wl7Rj1c3x
Last year, Genesis &amp; Suzy shared their sons’ stories during the health care debate, and they’ve stuck w/me. I’m sharing them again b/c the GOP keeps attacking millions of Americans’ health care, including those w/pre-existing conditions. #ProtectOurCare https://t.co/HZKsGTellt
News flash: The GOP #farmbill is still just as terrible as it was when it came up a month ago. https://t.co/cnOCmCl4Ke
Congress should invest in a future that provides everyone with the opportunities to succeed. Instead, the #GOPbudget strips away people's health care and retirement security and slashes funding for critical housing, infrastructure and education programs. https://t.co/wldFniAGA6
This is a big win for our state &amp; local communities, and brick-and-mortar retailers who now get a chance to compete on a level playing field w/out-of-state internet companies that have maintained an unfair edge by not having to collect sales taxes. #SCOTUS https://t.co/Uds42yx3fY
I believe we should give people on #SNAP the tools and skills they need to find good-paying jobs, but it's clear the #GOP simply wants to take away nutrition assistance from millions of Americans and call it “reform.” And that is unacceptable.
It’s shameful that the @HouseGOP continues trying to blame low-income families, seniors and victims of hunger for the exploding deficit caused by the #GOPTaxScam. That’s why I’ve offered an amendment that rejects the deep cuts to #SNAP in the #GOPbudget. https://t.co/IX348b0pQp
Every dollar we spend - or cut - is a reflection of our values. Slashing programs that help families trying to get ahead in order to cut taxes for corporations and the wealthy has never led to good-paying middle class jobs, and it never will. #GOPbudget https://t.co/Mq95FyJUBT

Americans deserve a Congress committed to improving on the progress we've made to deliver affordable care to all, including those with pre-existing conditions. We should work on helping even more families, not luring them into buying plans that won’t protect them. #ProtectOurCare
This rule change brings us backward, to the days when getting sick could leave a family bankrupt, and drive healthy people out of the markets, pricing out the folks who need health care the most.
The President and GOP are actively sabotaging Americans’ health care and driving up costs by bringing back scam plans that may not cover critical care like emergency room visits, maternal care or chemotherapy. https://t.co/doBJAZUDqO
What's more, they've resorted to misleading &amp; lying in order to stoke anger, fear &amp; resentment. We're better than this, America. We are stronger and freer because of immigrants, and we should continue to be welcoming to those who are "hurtling through the darkness, toward home."
From expelling/banning refugees to detaining/deporting #DACA recipients and legal residents, to the current travesty of separating families seeking asylum, the Trump administration's xenophobia is infesting our country's immigration policy. https://t.co/AP8FvW5jYh
.@HouseGOP just released their budget – part 3 of their act to reward corporations &amp; wealthiest, paid for by YOU. With massive cuts in #SocialSecurity, #Medicaid &amp; #Medicare, and a hard “pass” on investments in our future, this #GOPbudget will hurt Americans in all walks of life. https://t.co/uwdC3SP2Ow
I implore my @HouseGOP colleagues to stop acquiescing to this lunacy and call on President Trump to reverse his inhumane decision to place children and their parents in traumatic situations. #KeepFamiliesTogether https://t.co/aZlePr6vKS
Watch live as I join with asylum recipients now living in #WA to hear their stories of why they fled their homes to come here. The Trump administration’s cruel policies of refusing asylum to those seeking shelter from violence must end. https://t.co/2j6353lTQo

We should all want a peaceful resolution with North Korea. That said, we’ve seen them make vague promises before. Any agreement needs a strong, enforceable verification process, not just President Trump’s trust in a brutal dictator because they have a “special bond.”

Voting is the bedrock of democracy. The Constitution says "the right of citizens of the U.S. to vote shall not be denied or abridged," not “use it or lose it." Today’s decision by #SCOTUS turns back the clock, but I'll continue pushing to protect voting rights for all Americans.
Today, the @FCC’s repeal of open internet rules goes into effect. But now is not the time to throw in the towel.

ICYMI: I've had the opportunity to work with @fredhutch on many occasions. There's no doubt in my mind that the investments made in the incredible work they’re doing has led to improved treatments and will lead to the cure itself. #CuresStartHere https://t.co/gc23sY08cs
A relief that the terrible #GOPFarmBill failed on the House floor today. Congress should be debating and working on a bipartisan bill that supports our farmers as well as the millions of families across the country who receive nutrition assistance. #ProtectSNAP
Incredibly tragic news. My heart goes out to the entire community of Santa Fe, TX. Our students should feel safe at school and be celebrating the end of the year, not running for their lives. It’s past time to stop these senseless acts of violence. #enough https://t.co/XuasA337lV
.@realDonaldTrump has made clear he will stop at nothing when it comes to attacking and undermining women’s health care. Make no mistake, this ideological crusade to gut #TitleX and @PPFA has one purpose - limit women’s access to care. https://t.co/LDT7oPcZ06
Just in case you missed it: https://t.co/obr8ewoY3l
“Our fiscal policy is very misguided, ill-conceived, and is ultimately, if not corrected, going to have damaging if not disastrous effects on our country including people’s retirement savings.” -@SteveRattner #TaxFacts https://t.co/zQkFvSNmAO
I applaud the House Republicans who are standing up to @SpeakerRyan to force votes on immigration legislation. Ryan and @POTUS have made false promises to bring up a bill before, so why should they be believed now? #ProtectDreamers https://t.co/rCGNjHEGln
Congress needs to craft forward-looking policies to take advantage of new opportunities and empower American workers of all ages w/the skills they need to participate and thrive in our evolving economy. I joined @HouseNewDems today to talk about how we get to #AFutureThatWorks. https://t.co/eLNVXsj8Ed
Our #LGBTQ neighbors contribute to our communities despite the violence, inequality and discrimination they face because of who they are and who they love. I stand with people around the world against homophobia, transphobia and biphobia. It is time to end the hate. #IDAHOTB https://t.co/RW313sf5m5
Opioid misuse affects families all across the country, including in #WA. I'm pleased the Ways and Means Committee took important steps yesterday to help stem the tide of the #opioid crisis, including two bipartisan bills I helped introduce, but there’s still more work to be done. https://t.co/XMKMS3nKyD
Right now, @SenateDems are voting to #SaveTheInternet, and I'm calling on @SpeakerRyan and @HouseGOP to hold a vote on similar #NetNeutrality legislation here in the House. The fight for a free and open internet is not over. https://t.co/f4dmB4GinN
Add in minimal wage growth, rising gas prices and increasing healthcare premiums due to GOP sabotage, any hint of benefit families might have seen from the #GOPTaxScam will be wiped out, and the increasing debt will continue to impede our ability to invest in the future.
The #GOPTaxScam is giving the richest corporations and individuals a windfall by adding trillions of dollars to our debt, threatening the long term health of the markets and Americans’ retirement security. https://t.co/hyjvhSkFzF
A record breaking $1T in dividends and stock buybacks go to show how the #GOPTaxScam was a massive giveaway to corporations and the wealthiest, all paid for on the backs of hardworking Americans. Trickle-down economics has never worked and never will. https://t.co/6tfdRP80Co
The #FarmBill makes clear the @HouseGOP's intent isn’t to give people the skills they need to obtain good-paying jobs. It's just another attempt to slash nutrition assistance for millions of children and working families and call it “reform.” #HandsOffSNAP https://t.co/92mgO4XrUI
A new @EdNCES study shows nearly all teachers pay for supplies from their own pockets - an average of $479 per year. If we want what's best for our kids, it's time we support our #publicschools and #educators. https://t.co/l8NFFwkaMV
Remember when the @HouseGOP wanted to eliminate the teacher's deduction in the #GOPTaxScam to help pay for a corporate tax cut? https://t.co/hwolfOk33n
We should be prioritizing funds to fix our crumbling #infrastructure now. Making smart investments would support jobs and economic growth in our communities, but @POTUS wants to do the opposite. #infrastructureweek https://t.co/6BIL2lhu1X
ICYMI: @AjitPaiFCC and @FCC's decision to eliminate #NetNeutrality rules allows cable companies and service providers to slow down or block the content you see. It's time Congress acts to protect the future of a free and open internet. #SaveTheNet https://t.co/huoEon4Rn0
Last week it was Mulvaney at @CFPB. This week it’s @BetsyDeVosED. We need real leaders who will work to strengthen oversight that protects American students, not weaken it so their rich friends can get away with scamming them. https://t.co/fjOQeQksg4

Orcas are a crucial part of our culture and ecosystem here in the #PNW. I've helped introduce #HR1584 to end the practice of holding Orcas in captivity. Here's a touching story of the Lummi's journey to bring one back home to the #PugetSound. #Tokitae https://t.co/G3YBOloIZV
We should be working harder to protect student borrowers from predatory lending practices. Mick Mulvaney's actions at the @CFPB are a blatant attempt to side with loan sharks instead of students. #studentloan https://t.co/tqRbJ8SP1h
ICYMI: Read my op-ed on how the GOP #FarmBill puts millions of Americans at risk of losing nutrition assistance. We don’t need false promises or lectures from @SpeakerRyan &amp; @HouseGOP about the value of hard work. We need solutions	that work. #HandsOffSNAP
I met w/@SecretaryRoss to urge the administration to focus on China's #aluminum market distorting practices instead of broad tariffs that harm responsible trade with other countries. A trade war could raise prices &amp; cost hardworking Americans their jobs. https://t.co/BWH9Jr0NBr
While #WA has already acted to protect #NetNeutrality, Congress must act to protect a free &amp; open internet for all Americans.

In celebration of #TeacherAppreciationWeek, I’m joining @RepSamGraves in introducing a resolution to recognize and honor the incredible contributions of teachers across the country.

Instead of unilateral action, POTUS should have worked with Congress and our allies to build on the #JCPOA to prevent Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapon and foster stability, not chaos, in the Middle East. But this rash decision lacks any sort of plan to achieve those goals.
President Trump’s decision to withdraw from the #JCPOA is a reckless move that undermines our credibility on the world stage, puts our national security at risk and eliminates our ability to maintain a watchful eye over Iran’s nuclear weapons program.

As a former businesswoman and entrepreneur, I know there's more we can do to advance an economic agenda that supports women, both as business owners and as workers. Because when women get the tools and the opportunity to succeed, our nation's economy is stronger.
We're making progress, but many women-owned businesses still don't have equal access to economic opportunity. They're a $3T economic force and support 23M jobs. Yet, women account for just $1 of every $23 in small business lending, despite representing 30% of all small companies.
Small businesses make up 98% of all employers in #WA - more than half our private-sector workforce. In Congress, I’m working to help our small businesses and local industries succeed so they can continue to grow and create good-paying jobs right here at home. #SmallBusinessWeek https://t.co/LKvDmgeluV

It's long past time for Congress to act to protect medical patients, recreational users and small businesses in states that have legalized and regulated #marijuana from being prosecuted now or in the future, which is exactly what my bill, the #SMARTEnforcementAct, would do.
Thirty states plus D.C. have legalized #marijuana in some form, yet possession or use for any purpose is still prohibited under the federal Controlled Substances Act, leaving every participant in the state markets — including cancer patients — at risk of prosecution.
I first saw one of Granite Falls High School's ultra-efficient cars at a parade a few years back, and it’s been fun to follow their successes since. Good luck to #ShopGirls &amp; #UrbanAutos at the #shellecomarathon this weekend! Follow the live results here: https://t.co/sZWoxkPjb7
Nineteen years after the horrors at Columbine, the inaction of some allows the scourge of gun violence to continue to tear apart families.

We should be updating our policies so American workers have the tools they need to take advantage of the opportunities &amp; overcome the disruptions. That's why I'm crafting legislation to have @USDOL @usedgov &amp; @CommerceGov work together to forecast the contours of the new economy.

I call on the IRS to grant extensions to anyone who is unable to pay their taxes on time through their website because of today’s failure. As a member of the Subcommittee on Oversight, I am committed to working with the IRS to find solutions.
The notion that on #TaxDay – when millions of hardworking people across the country are trying to pay their taxes lawfully and on time – the IRS’ online payment system suddenly crashes, shows there’s still much work to be done in addressing this critical issue. https://t.co/xQxW2Vevwf

Congressional Republicans falsely sold the #GOPTaxScam as a bill for the middle class, when in reality, the wealthiest 1%  will ultimately get 83% of the benefits. They promise that the benefits will trickle down to hard working Americans, but they never do and they never will. https://t.co/vdp3NnLO2J
The #GOPTaxScam will raise taxes on 86 million middle-class Americans over 10 years, while causing Americans’ health insurance premiums to skyrocket, all to pay for $2.3 trillion in tax cuts for corporations and the wealthiest. #TaxDay https://t.co/55Rt7h0abt

Like the #GOPTaxBill, this is a con. They don't suddenly care about deficits and debt. It's part of the plan. Increase our deficits and then use that as an excuse to shamelessly force damaging cuts to vital services such as #Medicare, #SocialSecurity and #Medicaid. https://t.co/hiBHrRyePK
Can't say I'm surprised, but the @HouseGOP’s hypocrisy to call for a balanced budget amendment after exploding our deficits with nearly $2 trillion in tax cuts that mostly benefit millionaires and big corporations is staggering.
I joined 47 of my colleagues in opposition to the nomination of Mike Pompeo to be Secretary of State. “We believe that Mr. Pompeo’s track record of opposing equal rights for the #LGBTI community, and his support for the use of torture...should disqualify him from consideration.” https://t.co/gx67mN24Tt
With 40% of #WA jobs tied to trade, we're the most trade dependent state, and many of my constituents rely on open markets for their business. In Ways and Means today, I asked @SeaportNW CEO John Wolfe how the administration's trade policies may affect jobs and our local economy. https://t.co/8eb4LeRelJ
Every year, millions of Americans file their tax returns, and it’s our job to ensure they're protected from enterprising criminals. My and @RepErikPaulsen's bill would protect taxpayers from tax identity theft and fraud, and I'm pleased it passed through committee today. https://t.co/I5rDQ3ITlv
And while this bill is clearly an incredibly important step forward, there's much work to do. Let’s build on today's progress. We need to stop cutting the IRS budget and thus its effectiveness, and invest in modernizing their systems to get the job done for American taxpayers.
It's long past time the IRS got rid of their fax machines &amp; '60s IT systems and entered the digital age.

Access to nutritious meals is an absolute necessity, and it's shameful that some of my colleagues are talking about cutting vital nutrition programs. Instead, we should work on reducing hunger and helping people become self-sufficient by finding good-paying, long-term employment.
I had the opportunity to join volunteers at the Granite Falls Community Coalition food bank today. A big THANK YOU for all of the hard work they do to provide healthy food to those in our community who are struggling. No one should have to go hungry. https://t.co/NkrZ1nBq7m
I chose to enter politics to help ensure everyone has access to basic needs &amp; an opportunity to provide for their family. And while my legislation to expand #LIHTC was in the omnibus, there's more we can do to lift families out of poverty &amp; increase access to affordable housing.
Organizations like @MarysPlaceWA are doing incredible work providing homeless women and children with a safe community to get back on their feet. No parent wants to be in a position where they can’t provide shelter for their family. https://t.co/HwNDfEJKkK
.@WashingtonTrade knows starting #tradewars with our partners isn’t the answer and will only cause more chaos and confusion in the markets, costing Americans good-paying jobs. We need targeted enforcement of our trade agreements to address the real challenges we face. https://t.co/xgMmhqCTki
It was great to hear about @Accenture’s #apprenticeship program, helping ensure we have workers ready for 21st century jobs! https://t.co/BZHrvlNlM0
To all the students, parents, faculty, staff and everyone out there today, I’m with you, I hear you, and I won’t stop pushing for commonsense reforms to stop the scourge of gun violence in our communities. #EnoughIsEnough #NeverAgain https://t.co/ReCCEUjyRU
Sorry I missed you all! But thank you for also coming to my D.C. office to share your stories and for representing MPHS, the Tulalip Tribe and #WA01 so well. You all give me hope for our future. #EnoughIsEnough https://t.co/6ATKtxQ8ES
It’s long past time for Republicans to stop sabotaging the ACA and start working across the aisle on solutions that help build on the progress we’ve made to bring down healthcare costs and provide stability for individuals and families. #ProtectOurCare https://t.co/BasELvCNbB
Too often, we forget that #healthcare is about more than numbers. It’s about real people. Eight years ago, the ACA became law, allowing millions of Americans to finally gain coverage. We can't go back to a time when getting sick meant going bankrupt. https://t.co/Iz7IXLwc4q
This was a compromise and I’m disappointed bipartisan proposals like the #DREAM Act were not included. There is no reason Congress shouldn’t act on this immediately.
That said, this comes six months into the fiscal year. Short-term, crisis-driven legislating is the most expensive and least efficient way to budget, and it keeps us from working on other priorities we need to address for our nation’s future.
While not perfect, I'm pleased the funding bill includes priorities I've been working on such as @NIH funding, funding to combat #opioids, investments in #infrastructure, and my bill to increase access to low-income housing.
Lawmakers must do more to ensure we fund resources &amp; research efforts to prevent future landslides from becoming national tragedies. That's why I introduced the bipartisan National Landslide Preparedness Act to help communities better prepare for when landslides occur. #OsoStrong
Today is the fourth anniversary of the tragic #Oso landslide, which in an instant took the lives of 43 of our neighbors. This community will always be near and dear to my heart. https://t.co/W3T4nHavRv

Real #taxreform would have ended this cycle of retroactive extensions and jockeying over uncertain tax policies. Congress shouldn't pick winners and losers, but should strive for a tax code that finally provides certainty to taxpayers so they can plan for the future.
Last year, I hoped we’d have a serious conversation on reforming the tax code in a way that gives every American the opportunity to succeed. That didn't happen. To be clear, the #GOPTaxScam was a giveaway to corporations, not real tax reform that supports hardworking families. https://t.co/LLgZ0Kemrl

As the 2nd largest market for a nearly $10 billion illegal trade in endangered wildlife products, we have an obligation to end illegal trafficking. Reversing this ban sends a terrible message to the rest of the world, and undermines important progress we've made over the years.

Relieved to hear my colleagues are all okay. My thoughts and prayers go out to the families of those in the vehicle.
My goal in Congress is to bring people together to find #bipartisan solutions to our nation’s problems. While at #SOTU, @POTUS makes claims he wants to meet in the middle but his actions of the past year have shown that’s far from true. Let’s make America bipartisan again.

Congress needs to protect our ecosystems by passing bills like the West Coast Ocean Protection Act, a bill I helped introduce that amends the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act to explicitly prohibit leases for the exploration, development or production of oil or natural gas.
Our country should be transitioning to clean and carbon-free energy sources, not taking on the risk of environmentally and ecologically damaging oil spills. https://t.co/oALqUKVWzj
@TheJusticeDept It’s time for Congress to take up solutions like my bill, the #SMARTEnforcementAct, to protect medical patients, recreational users and businesses in states like #WA that have legalized #marijuana. https://t.co/I6YZlQ1wvB

I led 129 of my bipartisan colleagues in calling on appropriators to provide adequate funding for @NIH. This helps push the boundaries of scientific knowledge, advance promising research &amp; offer hope to millions of Americans suffering from diseases. https://t.co/Q77czRmNKS
Unfortunately, what we have is a bill that does nothing to help millions of hardworking Americans, and we will no doubt be cleaning up the mess for years to come, not just today.
It should come as no surprise today that we’re voting again on the #GOPTaxBill that couldn’t pass muster because it was cobbled together in a hurry, hidden from the public and denied any meaningful vetting or debate.		Tax reform is hard. https://t.co/GHzhm763ny

As a society, if we’re going to demand corporations do their part in creating a culture that encourages people to come forward and report abuses, we need transparency and accountability, not subsidized settlements and silence. https://t.co/bcoes3EBbG
For too long settlements have been paid by powerful figures to victims of sexual misconduct in exchange for their signing non-disclosure agreements, keeping perpetrators’ reputations intact and company names out of headlines.
Today, I introduced a bill to eliminate tax breaks that allow corporations to deduct payments related to sexual misconduct, taking one step toward incentivizing real solutions rather than a system of sweeping harassment under the rug.
Today marks World AIDS Day. While we've made great advances in medicine &amp; education to slow the spread of HIV, the U.S. must remain committed to funding NIH and programs like #PEPFAR and the Global Fund that do crucial work in the fight to #EndAIDS2030. #WAD2017 https://t.co/OQ9sQHlXD4

@MomsRising Under #GOPTaxScam, a teacher spending his own money on classroom supplies will no longer be able to make that deduction. Families will no longer be able to deduct all state &amp; local taxes. A worker forced to move because her job is relocated can no longer deduct moving expenses.

Sadly, #GOP chose not to listen to hardworking Americans who are just looking for a little fairness and relief in our #taxcode. Instead, they voted for tax cuts for corporations, adding trillions to the deficit, paid for on the backs of future generations. https://t.co/LuzvcfpMiw
The #GOPTaxScam eliminates deductions used by students, families and seniors, yet maintains the same deductions for corporations. What’s worse, while the wealthiest receive most of the tax cuts in this plan, some #middleclass families could see their taxes increase.
Short version of this week's #GOPtaxbill markup: 	➡️D introduces amendment.	➡️Rs say it's a good amendment, but now is not the right time - vote NAY.	➡️Rinse, repeat.	So tell me, when is the right time if not in a W&amp;M markup? 	This is not #taxreform. This is a #GOPTaxScam. https://t.co/tJtIypPLrL
But the #GOPTaxBill undercuts the very notion of a civilized society. It is morally bankrupt &amp; an outright attack on the middle class, built on a foundation of lies and mischaracterizations. I will not accept this, and based on what I’m hearing, neither will the American people.
SCOTUS Justice Holmes once said, “Taxes are what we pay for civilized society.” The purpose of the tax code is not to give special breaks to corporations and the wealthiest, but to fund a functioning government &amp; support an environment where every #middleclass family can succeed. https://t.co/jldVuXSYbG

"I was reimbursed $100 from the district, but had also planned on the tax deduction to alleviate the pain. I don't have a lot of money, but my students deserve to be in a welcoming environment so we do what we have to do as teachers to provide a learning space that is inviting."

@wsucahnrs The more people understand how their food is produced and what that means for their bodies and the environment, the healthier we’ll all be.
@wsucahnrs If we’re going to succeed in building a better food system, we need to be engaged and improve how we produce, process &amp; prepare our food.
So it was an honor to join members of the #WA food community and speak at @wsucahnrs #BreadLab for the 2017 #GrainGathering.
Our #foodsecurity is critical. Research &amp; innovation in #agriculture allows us to produce more sustainable and higher quality foods. https://t.co/dkOAEOhpH0

Time has come for Republicans &amp; Democrats to join together on bipartisan solutions. Our constituents deserve no less.
The Senate’s rejection of another dangerous healthcare bill is a relief for families like Sammy’s and Colton’s. https://t.co/0nDsMfn8ON
@RepWalorski This bill will help ensure people’s access to emergency care is never out of reach — particularly for our rural and underserved communities.
I joined @RepWalorski in introducing a bill to update the #Medicare reimbursement system for air medical services. https://t.co/RWHKGHTfTa
In a medical emergency, every second matters. Receiving needed healthcare via air ambulance can be the difference between life and death.
Why is @SenateGOP trying to take us backward? #WA knows this didn’t work 20 years ago, and it’s certainly not going to now. #ProtectOurCare https://t.co/CuKNUrTZIC
I reintroduced #BirthControlPrivacyAct to ensure women’s personal medical decisions about contraception aren't disclosed to their employers.
A woman’s decisions about contraception and family planning are nobody’s business but her own. https://t.co/WthT72QwaE
That’s why I put forward commonsense solutions. We’re eager to work w/@HouseGOP on bipartisan ideas. #ProtectOurCare https://t.co/uNcXeLFiZI
Congress has a choice — bipartisan cooperation on healthcare, or a partisan assault on middle-class families. It should be an easy one.
Why is the President playing political games with those who have sacrificed to serve their nation? We should #ProtectTransTroops. (2/2)
Discharging highly-trained and talented #transgender troops does nothing but harm our national security. (1/2)
I’m pleased the House passed my bipartisan bill to expand access to home #dialysis therapy as part of the #Medicare Part B Improvement Act. https://t.co/136AlOwMjA
@SenateGOP It's clear they are more worried about fulfilling a reckless campaign promise than the millions of Americans who will lose care. #Shame
Today’s Senate vote to proceed on a mystery bill makes it abundantly clear that the @SenateGOP doesn't want to #ProtectOurCare.
It was great to talk with Amy and Emma from @LakeStevensWA today about supporting people with #disabilities and their families. https://t.co/8od5O6FmLw

Investments in #research are a key driver of America's economy &amp; our role as a leader in #innovation and #science. https://t.co/IXq6AGzifT
Targeted investments help people seeking a better life for themselves &amp; their families &amp; save the govt money by promoting self-sufficiency.
I offered an amendment to the #GOPbudget to help foster economic development and encourage job growth in struggling communities. https://t.co/w1W4IWyd5o
@USCBO Their plan leaves 32 million more Americans without coverage, doubles premiums &amp; leaves 75% of US without insurance options. #NotOnMyWatch
Latest nonpartisan @USCBO score is another devastating diagnosis for the GOP’s plan to repeal the #ACA. https://t.co/CJZ4WSeZaE
@WaysandMeansGOP I stand ready to work across the aisle if the GOP is serious about tax reforms that provide middle-class families with financial security.
It has taken 7 months for @WaysandMeansGOP to hold a hearing on how #taxreform affects #middleclass families, not just corporations. https://t.co/pMd21WYecm
Instead, the #GOPBudget shows an utter disregard for #middleclass families &amp; a complete lack of vision for what our future should look like. https://t.co/fC6yHzawHX

@RepDianeBlack Allowing patients to receive dialysis at home can dramatically improve their health outcomes and quality of life.

That’s why I've called on @SpeakerRyan to drop the threat of #ACA repeal &amp; work with us to stabilize the #health market. #ProtectOurCare.

@GOP As @PattyMurray and I heard from patients &amp; providers — decimating #Medicaid and addiction treatment options would harm millions, not help.

I helped @RepRonKind introduce the Tribal Tax &amp; Investment Reform Act to ensure tribes are given equal treatment in the federal tax code.
Kids like Sammy are why I’m fighting to #ProtectOurCare by opposing Republicans’ healthcare repeal bill. It’s not just mean, it’s immoral.
Sammy's mom told me we can't go back to a time when her family could go bankrupt after reaching his lifetime cap on care. #ProtectOurCare https://t.co/ykuf1lHGZo
@HerreraBeutler @RepRickLarsen It’s simply unacceptable that current law shields some convicted child abusers from paying the restitution they owe. https://t.co/jeeGrMklWR
@HerreraBeutler And today we took an important step in moving this bipartisan solution forward by adding it to the #NDAA with help from @RepRickLarsen.
That’s why I introduced a bill w/ @HerreraBeutler to ensure justice for all survivors of these horrific acts, regardless of who abused them.
When I heard Pennie's story, I was shocked there was a legal loophole denying justice for survivors of child abuse. https://t.co/Kak1yE4pxA

@coltonsarmy620 I will keep working to #ProtectOurCare &amp; I hope @SenateGOP comes to their senses before voting to harm middle-class families like Colton’s.

@USCBO @HouseGOP I hope the Senate has the courage and wisdom to stop this ill-conceived legislation before it destabilizes our #healthcare system.
@USCBO @HouseGOP The #AHCA raises costs for millions of Americans and robs them of their health insurance &amp; protections for pre-existing conditions.

But that’s not what they did. Their bill, slapped together haphazardly to check a political box, forces Americans to #PayMoreForLess.

The President’s #budget is light on detail but clearly outlines enormous setbacks in nearly every area affecting our economy.
My motion would protect #seniors and #Medicare by eliminating the irresponsible provision that robs the Medicare trust fund of $170 billion. https://t.co/eLIOCLbszK
Medicare is a lifeline for 58M Americans, including 90K in #WA01. We should strengthen it, not rob it &amp; force seniors to #PayMoreForLess. https://t.co/LZtcazFbay
Now, GOP continues their reckless campaign by denying lifesaving care b/c they oppose a woman’s constitutionally protected right to choose.
Last Congress, I sat through the 15-month charade of a Select Committee whose sole purpose was to spread false information about @PPFA. https://t.co/n7Tn6ihCg1

People like Katie, my constituent from Bothell, who had coverage for maternity care thanks to Medicaid expansion.
The #PayMoreForLess bill would decimate #Medicaid, ripping healthcare away from 600K people in my home state of #WA, including 36K in #WA01. https://t.co/OmWve23fwt
We should build upon the reforms we’ve already made to expand coverage and reduce costs — not destabilize our nation’s healthcare system. https://t.co/SswgcPl4Ps
Instead of making smart reforms to ensure all Americans have access to affordable health coverage, GOP is forcing people to #PayMoreForLess https://t.co/QfOZ72hJmV

This week, I spent 18 hrs in a markup of GOP's #PayMoreForLess bill without any data from @USCBO on how it affects Americans. #noscorenovote https://t.co/q5H6QONztL
That’s why I wrote to @HHSGov urging them to look into improving access to genetic testing and patient outcomes through precision medicine.
Innovations in healthcare — like precision medicine — are offering patients some of the greatest medical breakthroughs seen in generations.
We should build on reforms we’ve made to expand coverage &amp; reduce costs. Instead, GOP asks people to #PayMoreForLess https://t.co/exiWxGPHMZ
Instead of repealing Americans’ healthcare, we should take up commonsense fixes to improve the law. That’s precisely what my amdt will do.
But that does not mean we should just pull the rug out from under these business owners — which is exactly what this bill does.
The #ACA created a tax credit to help #smallbiz provide health coverage for workers &amp; families, but it's not working as well as intended.
My amendment stops this bill from making it even more difficult for #smallbusiness owners to provide #healthcare to their employees. https://t.co/W283rXDl2r

I urge my colleagues to vote ‘YES’ on my amendment to ensure Americans continue to have access to life-saving care through @PPFA.
Defunding @PPFA will do nothing but harm our nation’s most vulnerable — particularly those in rural and underserved communities. https://t.co/06vmhpPI3c
We should focus on covering vital women’s services like #birthcontrol which help w/family planning &amp; treating conditions like endometriosis.

This is a prime example of how we could work together to improve our #healthcare laws, rather than jamming through a destructive bill today.
My amendment with @RepLindaSanchez would repeal the #CadillacTax, something both Democrats and Republicans agree isn’t working. https://t.co/haJfLOStJg
Families in rural communities already face substantial barriers to healthcare. We shouldn't put access to healthcare farther out of reach.
I support the amendment from @RepTerriSewell to stop this bill from reducing access to healthcare in rural and underserved communities. https://t.co/klvJoudqAt
