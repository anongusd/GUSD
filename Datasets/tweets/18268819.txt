@ajcarrillo @evanhalper I’ve worked with El Toro and will with them on that.  Still sounds like science fiction.
@evanhalper Thanks. And always appreciate your writing.  That retrospective geofence thing... I’m checking with some vendors, but I am pretty sure it would have to be a place that was previously geofenced... otherwise how would they get the mobile IDs?
@ajcarrillo @evanhalper https://t.co/cDAMvKsboN
@philpaule Definitely.  I could see a very lucrative ad campaign by Florida strip mall massage parlors to geofence every NFL stadium in the country.  And I believe, legally, you would be innocent of any crime if you were hit with 20+ geofenced ads. Checking with Legal Eagle @LevinsonJessica
One fun example, last year I targeted @Political_Data ads to all the lobbyist offices around the CA State Capitol and every @templecoffee location.		But, I only could tell who exactly saw the ads when my friends would mention it to me, or when I would see them on someone’s laptop
And if you’re going the other direction, starting with a geofenced area and no voter file for targeting, then you’re just hitting every building and getting any random person who walks in there. You can’t tell if it is a targeted person or not who gets your ad.
This also misses how much of this data is anonomyzed. In almost all cases you have to load any personal data into pools - like 10K voters will be your “Target X” and then you can see you served 2k ads, but you’re not getting individual hits back and reloading to your database.
I also have never seen anyone move data from geofences to Facebook. I highly doubt that one. Facebook ads are often driven to the same voter file targets that you’ll target through a geofencing project, but I’ve never seen anyone take geofencing hits and load them into FB.
And it is an exaggeration to say that campaigns know where a voter goes... they can have many geofences, but that’s different.		Campaigns can’t see you in your car, or get a report of where you’ve been.  But they can tie ads to 20 places and if they’re lucky you’ll hit some.
But I do think some folks misled @evanhalper about just how powerful they were with the data... in particular, I don’t think anyone can go back in time and get mobile IDs from a location - that’s science fiction.  They would have had to purposefully goeofence that area first.
First thought: this has some exaggerations, but, yes, I’ve done plenty of geofencing, even geofenced the state Democratic convention in San Diego last year.  @evanhalper https://t.co/wgBugJhf35
@LevinsonJessica Mum can handle it. But let’s not let @SenecaRoseSac know.
@FlashReport @alexburrola Imho, I think you’re confusing polarization for policy.  There is a policy conversation, starting w/ fact that immigration is down and then looking at all measures. Then there is the polarizing, us/them, racist polarization for political gain.		These people aren’t policy dancing.

@katiemerrill We’re thinking the same thing.  I’ve been saying that if one candidate takes CA with a “winner take most” delegate strategy and walks out with ~300 delegates they are automatically set as one of the final two or three that will go the distance.
@katiemerrill To be more clear, I do agree that four, or maybe more, candidates will walk out of CA with some delegate haul... but I think the allocation of delegates is going to be more heavily weighted to one or two candidates, as long as there are 20 in the race, pushing most under the 15%.
@katiemerrill I take the under on the statewide.  And I believe there will be very few congressional districts where four candidates will get above 15%.

@aacosta30 @gilduran76 I like the @SlateGabfest conundrum, would you rather work for a mean boss who is effective/brilliant or a nice boss who is inept?  I’ve worked for both.  		Of course there are also awful+ineffective and nice+brilliant, but those are easy answers.

@TheThomasGuide And if you cast your ballot!
@TheThomasGuide Of course, if we could put all polling places up at least three flights of stairs, that would make sure people really cared.  I wouldn’t want the vote of anyone who would stop after just two flights of stairs.
@TheThomasGuide Great.  And once they register, when they move you’re cool with them staying registered, just having that updated, right?  Would be odd to suggest that they have to go and reregister every time they move, right?  It would almost be like you didn’t want them to vote.  🤔
@TheThomasGuide Low information voters may be dummies but they have the same civil rights as everyone else. 		Unless you think someone who is a “low information” dummy shouldn’t have to pay taxes since they don’t understand where the money is going.

@jasongay @06rcpnow24 Love your reporting @jasongay but I think reporters have bought into the short-sighted solutions that publishers say are the only ways to monetize online news.		We should want more eyeballs on your excellent reporting, and monetize in a way that values that. It needs a rethinking
@jmschwab Most in a millennia!
One year from today all eyes will be on Iowa’s 2 million voters, some tiny subsection of which will be going to the caucuses.  		In California, one year from today, 16 million California voters will be sent ballots in the mail.		Can’t wait to see how campaigns and media react.
@thethriftygene @jasongay Why is that the only way?  That’s ridiculous.  Two other options come to mind: 1) paid advertising (don’t @ me) and 2) having a kind of paywall collective, where subscribers to any print media can obtain access to all papers and all papers benefit.  Unilateral paywall was lazy.
@jasongay In his defense (as a two-paper a day print subscriber) newspaper publishers have done a horrible job creating a market that can monetize online views. So, they throttle readership, which should be encouraged.		The financials of newspapers are nearly as bad as pro cycling. ;)

@caloso89 https://t.co/7PJvnbsyqU
@velopol Definitely not envy.  Just think there should be more @reedhastings and fewer @EricTrump
@velopol I was waiting for a “trickle down” argument...  		But, just for shits and giggles, what is better?  What would ride tide of more boats?  What would be more moral of an economic outcome?
@velopol And “reducing hurdles for getting rich” equates to massive education access, big inheritance tax to reduce generational unearned family wealth, social justice, etc.
@velopol I’m pro-capitalism, no doubt about it. But I guess I’m also for a flatter wealth curve, reducing hurdles for getting rich, but then also making the possibility of the super rich dependent more on the elimination of the super poor. I’m a capitalist entree, socialist side dish.
@velopol How did that work out for him?		While I appreciate the fear of guardrails, it could be argued that elements of the current rules at play contribute to the incredible wealth disparity. And as we have seen before, there need to be constraints on capitalism to protect it from itself
@velopol Technically, his wealth that would be taxed is exactly that portion NOT going toward those functions.  It is the money he keeps.
@philpaule Agreed. But it would cost money or we would have to change funding priorities if we believe a human life, education opportunities, access to clean water, ability to achieve the American dream, etc... are the same for a kid born in Cupertino as one born in Hanford.
@philpaule And that’s not because the state is run by Dems or Reps, it’s because our government is put in place by a segment of our population that is heavily weighted to its affluent and baby boomers and they don’t want things taken away from them and given to the poor. A moral failure.
@philpaule Really good question.  And I think it is, in some ways.  Example: if you’re poor, you have shitty schools. That’s actually the opposite of what should happen in a moral society. Those with the greatest problems should have the best schools. But we don’t, because we are immoral.

@SpotOnPolitics I don’t think you’re stupid. But I’ve always been baffled as to why you stick to an aged strategy for digital. It never made any sense to me.
@SpotOnPolitics Glad you’re profiting. But unless you’re targeting actual voters you’re not doing precise digital targeting. It’s the difference between leafleting cars in a precinct, and walking to actual households of voters, and being able to target messages based on voter characteristics.
@SpotOnPolitics Precise would mean you’re actually hitting a targeted set of voters. If you’re paying for ads on news sites you can’t regulate that. You don’t need large targets to justify voter file targeting. Anything over 10kvoter file is best.		Non-voter file targeting = digital lawn signs.
@SpotOnPolitics @facebook Let me try again.  Your slogan is “precise political placement” but the only, only, only way to precisely place political ads is using voter file targeting.  Period.  Everything else is selling snake oil.
@SpotOnPolitics @facebook You’re saying words but they’re not meaning anything. Digital for political doesn’t have to be segregated from commercial.  But it is silly to use some commercial model for something like “progressive voter” when you can actually upload the ACTUAL voters you’re targeting.
@SpotOnPolitics @facebook If I put a list of 2500 likely voters into Facebook, it doesn’t matter if it is anonymized.  All that matters is that you know the ad is going ONLY to your targeted voters and nobody else.  All campaigns know this. It is digital targeting g 101.

@SpotOnPolitics @facebook Agreed, on national if the states targeted have really bad voter files.  But commercial data in comparison to CA specific voter file makes targeting worse, not better.
@galendruke Wish you could split this into a poll of CA folks and the other 49.

@530BruceRoss @facebook Probably because they were relying on facebook’s internal targeting.  The better way is to load voter file data for matching targeted voters.  Then you hit the people you want.
At least they’ve got their bear facing in the right direction.  That campaign logo was an abomination. https://t.co/adEl2D9xK8
@SpotOnPolitics @facebook And any digital targeting with “similars” or commercially targeted lists for political campaigns is a total waste of money at best, actually harmful at worst. Digital targeting for campaigns needs a voter file backbone.
@SpotOnPolitics @facebook Hey, I make more selling data for mailers, so happy with that synopsis, but digital using voter data to drive it is powerful on a cost-effectiveness sense.  But, sure... spend those digital dollars on mail!  Happy with that too! ;)

@ashsoles Oh, really?  How exactly.  I’d love to see the voter fraud scheme that consists of getting legitimately registered, then purposefully not voting for years so you get put on inactive, then “bam!” Voter fraud.  That is nonsensical.

No it doesn’t. The “voter roll” is the actual active voter registration.  Your entire lawsuit ‘victory’ doesn’t impact one single active voter registration - - not one.  You’ve won a lawsuit about how long old files can be kept in storage.  Congrats 🎉.  Idiots. https://t.co/f3LZucpIy8

@DanaWilliamson2 @ASDem @GavinNewsom Gavin indeed got a record margin and votes, but higher registration means that the raw votes John Cox received was still higher than Whitman or Kashkari.
@WTPDavid Well, in CA Dems picked up a seat in 2010, and picked up a congressional in 2014 (while losing a couple legislative seats).  So for dems in CA the midterms were a mixed bag at worst.  What we just saw was more like CA Dems in 1994.
@WTPDavid @CA_120 Ok, I’ll bet you $100 that		(white Republican seniors voted 2018)/ (white Republican seniors voted 2016) 		is greater than 		(young democrats voted 2018)/	(young Democrats voted 2016)
@WTPDavid @CA_120 Oh, let’s put a bookmark in this until we have the date. I believe that take is completely wrong. I bet you dollars to donuts that a higher share of the older more conservative vote showed up than the younger more progressive, that’s what makes 2018 a massive warning for 2020.

@jefflalloway Oh, from like a decade ago? I would be just as opposed to this as putting white guards at Latino precincts in OC over a decade ago.		Also, for the record, what some couple of guys do at a precinct is wrong, but what a state does to systemically disenfranchise voters is worse.
@jefflalloway Ok, and what in God’s name do you think that is a picture of?   I don’t know where you’re headed here... but it’s looking really bad. Please explain before everyone on twitter starts interpreting this as racism.
@jefflalloway I do not endorse.  		However, the voter suppression laws attempted in Georgia are an affront to democracy.  They are wrongheaded attempts to take away constitutional rights from citizens in the name of some fake “voter fraud” fears.
@DanielMorain And that includes the Lou Correa seat, which I’m sure Gavin won.  Will be fun to unpack at the congressional or precinct level the number of voters that split ticket - voting for the Dem Congressional candidate, but not Newsom.

@jefflalloway @markzbarabak @johnmyers @jfwildermuth @kevinyamamura @BryanRAnderson Respectfully, you’ve just provided a perfect synopsis of what happens.... Just saw something on the internet, reposted it without critical analysis, admit it was wrong, but hold same opinion anyways, can’t disprove a negative so, maintain original opinion.
@jefflalloway @markzbarabak @johnmyers @jfwildermuth @kevinyamamura @BryanRAnderson I generally have a lot of respect for your arguments but why do you post something with a headline “200,000 illegal voters” which, when you read it was edited to maybe 2,000, and even that has no actual non-citizen voters?  That’s not something that helps an honest conversation.
@Sam_Mahood @StevenHerbert @CASOSvote @jmschwab Any prediction on how many counties will be VCA, or equivalent “all mail” voting?
@jefflalloway @markzbarabak @johnmyers @jfwildermuth @kevinyamamura @BryanRAnderson Oh, yeah, quite the opposite. I have lots of confidence in the CA process.
@jefflalloway @markzbarabak @johnmyers @jfwildermuth @kevinyamamura @BryanRAnderson Also noteworthy that some claimed registrars in CA were part of some Democratic conspiracy. But registrars are mostly Republican or Independent. Small number of Democratic registrars in CA.
@jefflalloway @markzbarabak @johnmyers @jfwildermuth @kevinyamamura @BryanRAnderson Not none.  For example, an idiotic consultant I know moved himself and friends into a tiny school district zone so they could vote in a tiny bond election. He was caught. That’s voter fraud. It happened. But systematic registration of non-citizens?  No effing way.
@jefflalloway @markzbarabak @johnmyers @jfwildermuth @kevinyamamura @BryanRAnderson Happy to.  Let’s go.  But I do know where I’m an expert, here in CA, that what we hear about voter fraud is complete fiction.

@billburton @jmschwab @jbpollster @johnmyers I think the defense of the system is the most understandable thing.

@TheArmedLiberal @cmarinucci Because older, whiter, homeowners vote early, renters, Latinos, younger, vote later.  They are also the overwhelming majority of provisional voters.
@Life_Aint_Fair Probably an amount equivalent to the number that will be deemed invalid for some reason, so probably a wash.
This is even more probable with the report of 4.5 million outstanding ballots.  It’s not just the quantity, it’s the composition of voters required to get from 3.5m to 4m to 4.5m... each marginal growth of this pool of voters gets more and more young and diverse. https://t.co/BRHRoo9G4J
@seijibk You thinking CA50?
https://t.co/HN4jeVcUWH
And there it is.  4.48 million outstanding ballots.  More still coming in, but not all will be valid.  And these are still estimates.  		Would put total turnout at 60%.  With more to come and not all being valid, this is the first good ballpark turnout number.
My final guess is 4.5 million unprocessed ballots... still hitting the refresh button.
@cshepherds @jbpollster @stevesingiser @LATpoliticsCA @rpyers Ballots are just stuffed into bags and boxes, not counted by district or anything.
@rudnicknoah @MarianoMarx_ @rpyers Here is some food for thought... and these are from election cycles with a much lower percentage of late uncounted ballots and some not very big field operations.  		I think DC folks should be looking at that @ScottPetersSD number. https://t.co/GzM9rm8Fr1

@honyocker @ssharmon @LATSeema @NateSilver538 But, 8 days, still you to make sure they are signature verified. And there are probably 9 million signatures that need to be verified?		Oh, and need to make sure provisionals are counted... which means verifying they are registered, and that they didn’t also vote somewhere else.
@honyocker @ssharmon @LATSeema @NateSilver538 Can’t have both.  Right now ballots can be received under law by Friday if they are postmarked... so, extend to Friday?		But a ballot shows up in the wrong county... we allow the registrar a few more days to get it to the right county.  So, extend to Wed?  8 days?
@honyocker @ssharmon @LATSeema @NateSilver538 So, which would you like to eliminate:		- by mail voting 	- allowing by mail ballots to be dropped off at the polling place	- verifying signatures	- allowing ballots postmarked by Election Day to be counted	- allowing ballots that show up in the wrong county to be counted.

@johnmyers @billburton And, the most important fact: it doesn’t matter how long it takes. No legislator has been delayed in being sworn in because of the counting. There is plenty of time... What, do they need to hurry for reporters or people who view elections as sport? Nah.  It’s a right, not a game.
@johnmyers @billburton I’m not an expert in the national data scene, but our mail in is different than other states “early vote” where the voter is verified at the polls and you’re not having to do signature verification somewhere else.  We also go to great lengths to make sure every vote counts.

Based on the current returns, one could guess that Dems will pick up 4 seats in CA.  If that comes true, Republicans would have gone from 20 congressional seats in 2004 to 10 in 2018.

@codymcdivitt @boydvenable @Political_Data It's not offensive to me to have voting be an assignment, just like going to a museum can be an assignment, or going to a city council meeting, reading a newspaper, or whatever. But, technically, they can't give an inducement to vote.
@boydvenable @Political_Data That’s actually not legal.  You cannot provide any inducement to vote in federal elections.  (But you can in local/state if there aren’t any federal races on the ballot)

@AndrewBond3 All day Monday.  Did a couple counties today and that’s probably it for the weekend.
@dataandpolitics the AV stuff is only availble from the counties in CA, and we were the only ones that used to get it - still get it faster than anyone else.  The stuff from the national firms is kinda laughable.  I just posted 3.6m, then got an email from a vendor saying "3.1m have voted in CA"
@dataandpolitics Off on total voters.  I have a frozen archive of ballot returns from 2014, I don't know what they are working off of, but it is very short.  For example, total 2014 by this day is 2,568,405, and total today is 3.6m. My 18-39 count is 272,730 for this year and 135,004 for 2014.
@dataandpolitics Also, I don't know about the rest of the Target Smart data, but their CA data was waaaaaay off for their 2014 numbers.  That would also be a big red flag.

@zackryanfrank72 @LSATtutor @imthemadridista @Nate_Cohn @Political_Data @DanaRohrabacher I have the 14 and it was only at 2.5m in 2014, uploading now at 3.6m.  But in 2014 there were 9m  voters who were mailed ballots, this year it is 13m.
@VictorB123 @WTPDavid Not that much though... in the primary the voters who were previously poll voters used the vote centers. Habits are hard to break.
Crazy for a long time Californian, and someone who came up in Orange County politics, but @FiveThirtyEight has their “tipping point” for Democrats to take Congress, which they say is an 85% possibility.		And five seats, #CA10, #CA25, #CA45, #CA48 and #CA49 are on the ‘flip’ side. https://t.co/DxchsY6fQJ
@boydvenable @RandySF45 @Nate_Cohn @Political_Data @DanaRohrabacher You can compare to primary where the seniors ran the table on everyone else.
@boydvenable @RandySF45 @Nate_Cohn @Political_Data @DanaRohrabacher Today.  Using the third tab you can see the trend lines of those daily returns.
@adlerben @CA_120 Could be cannibalization.
@boydvenable @RandySF45 @Nate_Cohn @Political_Data @DanaRohrabacher Note, a non-traditional electorate doesn’t mean a flip.  In 2014 Dana won 65% to 35%.  Even a heavily non-traditional electorate isn’t enough alone.
@boydvenable @RandySF45 @Nate_Cohn @Political_Data @DanaRohrabacher The seniors as half or more of the electorate is normal... since the last weekend they fell under that. At 39% today, that’s not normal... speaks to a weakening of their traditional lock on early vote.
@Nate_Cohn @Political_Data @DanaRohrabacher Yeah, that’s a good benchmark, but if field operations are on fire in these competitive seats it could be lower there.		Big Q I’m thinking about right now... what percent will be left to count on Wed?  30% or more? Won’t be able to call a bunch of these seats for a long while!
@Nate_Cohn Since you’re polling in this district, I’ve set the @Political_Data early vote tracker to default to #CA48 as well.	https://t.co/VIOoI3GCHK	Seeing high early turnout, and the trend lines for returns by age and party suggest a very non-traditional electorate for a CA midterm here. https://t.co/h7WklbKTBw
@PoliticsReid @TargetSmart @tbonier In CA it’s up from 88,076 to 131,206, so 49% growth.  		But... there were 830k ballots sent to these voters in 2014, 1.4m this year, a 69% increase...		Is this any part of the math in this analysis?  What sayeth @ElectProject?

@GabbardCongress All rights, except when there is a compelling state interest.  For example, with protest, the government should be able to restrict place/time so people aren’t barnstorming the freeway at rush hour because that’s their “right.”
@aacosta30 You gotta spend all those political dollars somehow...
@jacksantucci @IsaacHale No.  It is my version of a joke.  But as @SenecaRoseSac keeps telling me, I should stick to jokes like “knock-knock” and “why did the chicken cross the road.”
@jacksantucci @IsaacHale Well, wasn’t the creation of states the ultimate gerrymander?  When are we going to reapportion states and make them all the same population?  🤷‍♂️
@WTPDavid That one effing Canadian dude. Maple-syrup chugging, moose loving, non citizen... ugh.
@WTPDavid But you’re placing a burden on voters that we know impacts some populations more that others to fix what exactly?  A made up conspiracy theory?  Doesn’t weigh out. And doesn’t stop the next conspiracy theory (millions of Mexican citizens making fake IDs to vote in CA elections!!)
@boydvenable @WTPDavid I’m all for that.  Verify someone is a citizen, eligible (over 18, not Charles Manson), that they haven’t voted somewhere else, and let them vote.
@WTPDavid I think registration deadlines are a burden, voter ID is a burden, long lines are burdens... figuring out how in the hell to vote on these crazy propositions is about the only burden I want voters to bear. Other than that, voting should be a right of citizenship, not infringed.
@WTPDavid 👆so, in your mind voter fraud wouldn’t be solved by ID, because you think it happens more in the mail (no evidence) but you still want ID at the polls despite agreeing it isn’t a systemic problem?  Mmmm... ok.
@WTPDavid You said 502 were turned away, that is a burden. My wife has to go to the DMV to get a license, you can call her and tell her that’s not a burden! 🤣		Drinking and driving is a perfect example of a documented problem. Voter Fraud via impersonation because there is no ID is not.
@WTPDavid (3) stating that 502 people were turned away for not having an ID is not exactly a resounding argument FOR voter ID laws.  		And, how are you going to enforce Voter ID with the state’s 13 million mail-in voters?
@WTPDavid (2) yes, anyone can get an ID by standing in line at the DMV for four hours. Also, anyone can learn enough English to pass a literacy test. Anyone can take a bus to a polling place that was moved out of their city. Anyone can update their registration annually, etc.
@WTPDavid (1) a burden on a right where there is a compelling state interest. If there is no documentable voter fraud (despite our elected president claiming that two million non-citizens voted in CA) then what is the state interest in this burden?
@jefflalloway First I’ve seen of that, and if it is true, it is awful. I don’t think voter suppression is a Republican or Democrat problem, it is a “people who are willing to throw away ethics to preserve political power” problem.
@lot_49 It IS the systemic voter fraud.
@WTPDavid But.... (1) when I’m turned away from Costco it’s not taking away a constitutional right, (2) plenty of people don’t have ID, inc. my wife who lost her wallet last week, (3) in CA your reg needs to be matched to DMV/SSA records, or you DO have to show ID the first time you vote.
If you’re driving in LA you might have just heard me get into a 20 minute fight on the radio about fake voter suppression claims and voter ID. Gawd... can we all just admit that voting is a right, and not preconditioned on you walking around with your ID?

@codymcdivitt @Nate_Cohn That’s a lot of people who hated Hillary then, deciding they don’t like trump/Congress now, combined with differences in turnout.
@Nate_Cohn Yeah, I fortunately don’t have to deal with that many “interactions.”  		Btw, I’m doing a @Capitol_Weekly article that that is a kinda defense of the early vote but gives lots of reasons to be skeptical, mentioning you, @NateSilver538 and @baseballot - the three anti-EV Nate’s.
@Nate_Cohn However, in CA districts, party registration (avoiding talking about the independents here) is much more a sign of voter choice in LA / Orange County than in the Central Valley where Republicans have won legislative and congressional races in +18 and +20 Dem districts.
@smallfry9 @CapitolEVAN Sometimes if you’re doing a count report of a universe it is best to save it as a static list (a file of all the IDs) since what slows down the counts is the system re-building your universe over and over for every part of the report.

@mikehtrujillo @gelliottmorris Ha. The guy you knew allows perceptions to change based on the data... the "Latino's don't AV" talk is dated, and helped justify the late adoption of AV in LA that still hurts turnout in one of the most Dem bases in the state. Dems shot themselves in the foot with that argument.
@mikehtrujillo @gelliottmorris More importantly, in the 18 Primary 57% of Latino vote was by Mail (half of that a week before EDay).		In the 18 Primary Latinos were 16% of the vote (vs. 25% of the reg). At 12-days out they are one-point behind where they were 12-days out in the 2018 Primary. https://t.co/ZmvPbD0SvJ
@mikehtrujillo @gelliottmorris Hate to break it to you @mikehtrujillo, but you might be showing your age....		Yes, historically Latinos in CA were EDay voters. In 2014 there were only 1.7 million Latinos who were AV.  But, in 2018 this has skyrocketed to 2.8 Million.
@gelliottmorris ...also skeptical. Not any evidence of Latino turnout spiking right now.  And if white voters elect Democrats in heavily Latino seats, that’s not the same thing.		Unfortunately we won’t know actual Latino turnout for months, so takes like this can settle in before we really know.

@KPCCsharon Yep, I stayed registered in LA the whole time I was at college in DC.
@KPCCsharon Low because so many of those voters aren’t living in the same dorm they were when they last registered.  18-28 year olds move on average four times, that’s about once every statewide election in that 10 years. 		In math terms, the denominator is inflated.
@SaboSays Not in article was that there was a system update at beginning of September that stopped that problem from continuing.  The date of the LA times Canadian guy registered on 8/30
@530BruceRoss Yeah, there was an update at the beginning of Sept.  and that one in the LA Times was on 8/30
@530BruceRoss Because those problems were fixed and the automatic registration is updating and registering a ton of voters.  If getting close to 100% registration is a state goal, this is the most impactful tool we have.
@aacosta30 Gripe #2: strange guy with a TV camera... he could be asking “who likes donuts?” Or “who here plays video games?” and likely get the same blank stares.		This reporter should instead go sit in on some real focus groups.

@TimValderrama @JC6937 I think you’re underestimating the number of Reps who weren’t energized and their potential impact in these races.  But you’re right about the other end of the equation. The greater the Dem enthusiasm gap, the more successful their candidates will be.
@mwstafford @TheThomasGuide 👆 that’s what I think too.
@TimValderrama @JC6937 I'm not totally disagreeing... but there is data showing Republicans are more energized than before, and Dems were already super energized. Question really is... will the Rep energy be temporary?  I think it will be.  Apparently you think it will be too.
If the election were held today, Republican energy from the SCOTUS win would be through the roof, probably save them from losing the house.  		But the election is still 32 days away. Will this win sustain the Republican base that long?

@TheThomasGuide I would predict post-confirmation that Rep enthusiasm wanes and Dem enthusiasm grows.
@TheThomasGuide Yeah. Will be interesting to see that.  Pls add me to your secret distribution!
@TheThomasGuide You think voters turn out because of gradutude for what congress just did, or out of fear/hope for what they can/will do going forward? Seems like a coming fight is more motivating than a fight you just won.		Of course this is all academic, since we can’t play out both scenarios.
@TheThomasGuide And very quickly, well before much raptly voting has taken place, the Republican base, angry about it all, makes a huge enthusiastic push to make sure they can hold that SCOTUS seat.  Seems more motivating than discouraging over the course of the last three weeks before EDay.
@TheThomasGuide I’d love to have a cigar and walk through this with you...   it seems like that’s a good analysis for the first 48 hours after he fails confirmation (if that were to happen) but over time the greater fact would be that a new nominee is put forward, presumably a squeaky clean one.

@WTPDavid @Nate_Cohn @NateSilver538 I think POTUS will spin this up for the base as a F$&amp;K Democrats!!  I have no doubt he would love to see the election defined by the need for a conservative justice, rather than his own issues.
@WTPDavid @Nate_Cohn @NateSilver538 Giving Dems waaaaaaay too much credit. It’s not like they found a magic genie to stop Republican SCOTUS appointees for all time!  This one was a massive outlier. 		Unless you think all your potential nominees have claims of sexual assault in letters to their member of Congress.
@WTPDavid @Nate_Cohn @NateSilver538 Oh, if they confirm BK now, all the anger is going to be on the Dem side.  And reps are gonna turnout because they’re so excited about something in the past?
@WTPDavid @Nate_Cohn @NateSilver538 That’s foolish.  They can get almost anyone confirmed.  And they would have had BK confirmed if not for this.  You’re giving Dems too much credit.  They just got lucky.
@WTPDavid @Nate_Cohn @NateSilver538 And I actually think having this be done could depress Rep turnout. Dems totally angry, lots of women angry, and bade Republicans.... they got what they wanted.  What is turning out to vote going to do?		Voters turn out because of hope or fear.  Not gratitude.
@WTPDavid @Nate_Cohn I think @NateSilver538 has made the point I agree with: this is spin by people who want Kavanaugh. 		Yes, Reps are energized by Kavanaugh. But if the seat goes vacant they will be energized to make sure they hold the senate.
@CMfin I think in the immediate short term you’re right (which is why I thought they would do this a couple weeks ago). 		But, even if they did it this week, there would be enough time before the election for the base to realize that a SCOTUS seat on the line is highest priority.
I know I’m still an outlier with this line of thinking, but isn’t the best Trump/Republican strategy STILL to let Kavanaugh go down, then characterize Dems as obstructionists, rile up the Republican base with the SCOTUS seat, hold the Senate then jam through whomever you want?

@WTPDavid I think a lot of that congressional number was because everyone thought Clinton was going to win.

@mwstafford @Scotus Oh, I don’t have one. I’ve always thought this thing is a lose-lose.  Kavanaugh on the court is a huge loss for Dems, but they would still be very favored to win the house, especially now.  And a vacant SCOTUS seat heading into a general election is a campaign nightmare.
And if your response is that the @scotus vacancy will energize Democrats... here’s the problem: Democrats are already extremely energized for the General. Republicans currently aren’t to the same extent, and might not be, unless something in the next six weeks wakes them up.
@Aztec4Life13 @Scotus Possibly, but if they pull back and in six weeks there’s just a vacancy, then that could be buried by 100 news cycles.
The @scotus vacancy in 2016 gave some Republican voters who didn’t like Trump the justification to vote for him, as the future of the court was on the line.		If you don’t think another election with a @scotus vacancy isn’t a turnout driver for these Rep voters in 2018, you cray.

@BryanRAnderson @Political_Data @surveyusa And weighting by education thing isn’t a useful critique either for a poll in CA - but very useful for a national poll or a poll in a state with garbage voter files.
@BryanRAnderson @Political_Data @surveyusa Oh, I’m not disputing it if you want to say one poll’s findings are bad, I’m just saying that the whole “AP stylebook” thing is a mischaracterization, and he put out an MOE, not the poll’s fault that a reporter didn’t cite it, and the 538 thing isn’t really useful.
@BryanRAnderson @Political_Data @surveyusa You’re gonna have to take back that AP stylebook claim if you’re basing that on the online component.
@BryanRAnderson @Political_Data @surveyusa The AP isn’t referring to this kind of poll which used an email from the voter file soliciting a respondent to an online poll - a methodology which basically only exists in CA.  Read this: https://t.co/pz2IKKO0ui
@BryanRAnderson @Political_Data I don't think it is fair to say the poll doesn't "rise to the standard" to be worthy of reporting.  All the details including MOE are here: https://t.co/uFE8IPzcms - and the 538 pollster ratings are high for @surveyusa and their CA work is a disaster, so, there's that.
@BryanRAnderson @Political_Data Yeah, I could have gone point-by-point, but just wanted to focus on the "weight by education" thing because that's something which has been gleaned from lessons in national polling (particularly from states with bad data) and doesn't really apply in CA.
@BryanRAnderson Besides, the "weighting by education" is based on census block group data - not individual education levels - so it is really muddy.  Better to weight by homeowner or renter, age, ethnicity, party (all of which is in @Political_Data files)
@BryanRAnderson Could comment on each point, but the #3 really most needs a response.  		Weighting by education is in vogue because many national polls don't have consistent data - states without partisan registration, ages, ethnicity, etc...  But not the same case in CA where we have great data

In Sacramento we elected a couple cyclists to the city council.  @Steve4Sac @JaySchenirer https://t.co/WeRdXvxZ7z
@WTPDavid @ScottCLandis Haha. Should I have a disclaimer for the mentally deranged and crack addicts?
@krieghan I think the fairer statement is “if you don’t feel safe in the street let’s work together to make safer streets” and if you want to add “...so you can get off the damn sidewalk” that’s fine too.
@WTPDavid @ScottCLandis Dog leashes should scare any cyclist into stopping.  But when we see a cyclist on the sidewalk we should think “why is he/she afraid to ride in the street?”
@ScottCLandis Totally legit.  Pedestrians should be at the top of the safety pyramid, then bikes, then cars, then tanks and trains and battleships, etc...		If I’m riding on a sidewalk and there are pedestrians in my way, I stop.  Like, literally clip out and put a foot down.
@ScottCLandis But in Sacramento and many cities it is legal.  Like I said, I’m not a fan of it, and I very rarely do it (had to recently in Houston where apparently bike lanes are illegal or something) but it is allowed in some areas. And we should be aware it is being done out of fear.
To drivers, a bunch of seemingly spastic bikes on the roads are an inconvenience or distraction. But to cyclists, every car is potentially life threatening. 		You might worry about having to tap your brakes for a second, but I have to worry about never seeing my daughter again.
And if you don’t ever ride a bike in a city, maybe you should before you criticize.  Try dealing with disappearing bike lanes, cars speeding up to cut you off, getting brushed by cars who don’t give three feet, seeing drivers on their phone and knowing they don’t see you.
That’s why I don’t immediately fault a cyclist who rolls a stop sign (almost always being done to try and stay ahead of the traffic) or riding on the sidewalk (generally not a good idea, but what makes some cyclists feel safe).
People say people in cars and people on bikes should both follow the law, and that’s good and all... but we should  acknowledge that the latter is spending half their time in fear that the former is going to kill them. 		Both are equals, but it’s not an equal playing field.
@Pflax1 Legal in Sacramento, and necessary in some circumstances, but I’m generally not a fan when there are bike lanes - - but when I see it I think “why don’t these cyclist feel safe in the bike lane rather than just treating them like they’re bad people.
@AdamMyerson Is this the hill we’re gonna die on?
@MeaganBright @stevenmaviglio @DowntownSac @TheCityofSac Yeah. Might be just your thing to not consider the safety of cyclists and legitimate fear among members of your community who have to decide how they are going to get home without being hit by a car.  Must be nice.
@MeaganBright @stevenmaviglio @DowntownSac @TheCityofSac And I see cyclists on the sidewalk, which I don’t do, but I see them as being too afraid to ride in the street... and I see that as a legitimate fear that we have a responsibility to deal with. Cyclists are killed by cars. When was the last time a driver was killed by a cyclist?
@MeaganBright @stevenmaviglio @DowntownSac @TheCityofSac I often “purposefully don’t abide by traffic laws” when I believe they put me in danger.  For example, I will go before a light turns green if I know the other side of the intersection is missing the bike lane - so if I go with the flow of traffic I could be sideswiped.
@stevenmaviglio @MeaganBright @DowntownSac @TheCityofSac Most cyclists I see doing something stupid are basically making a decision based on how they can get home without getting hit by a car - sidewalks, rolling stops (to get away from cars behind them) and other behavior. People in cars don’t fear dying on their daily commute. ✌🏻

@Moonsea63 @DanteAtkins Imagine a tariff on In-n-Out patties, causing higher Double-Double prices.		If you’re ok with Burger King if In-n-Out is more expensive then In-n-Out bears burden of tariff. 		If you believe it isn’t an acceptable alternative you stick with In-n-Out you pay more and bear burden.
@Moonsea63 @DanteAtkins Yep. Elasticity has to do with people’s willingness to use alternatives rather than pay more.  Fact is that the incidence of a Tax or Tariff comes down to who is more willing to bend.  Like a financial game of chicken.

@WTPDavid And 2016 was a great year for Democrats here.  The underlying turnout can’t be better in 2018 than 2016, so candidates and $$ have to be Waaaaay better.

@LudovicSpeaks Lost me at “largest VBM database” since I don’t believe we provided data for this election. 		But I have other thoughts.... probably should read the study, but (1) this has been shown before and (2) it is different than SB450 and (3) 18p data isn’t even out yet.

Yep, by my math, if CA used the most free-wheeling definition from the Ohio case to purge voter rolls, almost half of the purged voters would be from LA county. Also, half would be Latino.  Would most impact 30-49 year olds. https://t.co/iA7yW4cUUt
The California State Supreme Court should invalidate any election system that places the integrity of the voting process before the needs of reporters to write a story about who won, or what final turnout was.

Hey @latimesopinion - before you went out reporting 25% turnout, you should have read this... or at least checked in with one of your political reporters @johnmyers @markzbarabak @melmason @cmaiduc 		(And you don’t get a pass saying that a “trickle” of more ballots are coming in) https://t.co/YtMFCGEJAi
@Sam_Mahood @Maxbp @bartlettcharles It don’t let that stop anyone for blaming their election loss on low turnout!
@Maxbp @Sam_Mahood @bartlettcharles Uhm, bro, in California statewide and local elections the “turnout percentage” 48 hours after an election is meaningless.  In Sacramento alone they have only about 140k votes cast, so like 20% turnout, but 235k unopened, so 50% after those are counted.
@RobStutzman Exactly. Only real Dem shutout in CA where it wasn’t expected or likely is in the AD76 race which is a Dem on Dem runoff, but just barely, in the previously Republican seat held by Rocky Chavez. Will see if that holds.

In LA &amp; hear radio ad attacking Scott Baugh. This is what I’m thinking:		- Ad is hitting ALL of SoCal... an area of 20 million. 	- the target is #CA39, with 709k people	- of those 352k are voters	- 141k are Reps	- 50k Reps will vote. 		That’s 1 target for every 400 listeners.

@chrisFnicholson The election of a non-white mayor isn’t “proof” of anything. Very few in the city even knew who she was, other than she wasn’t David Roberti.		And we’re minority groups able to effectively use the system to elect a “candidate of choice” or was her election flukey?
@chrisFnicholson Have to balance:		(1) the desired impact that can be found in experimental setting, and 		(2) the learning curve required to allow for equitable implementation - for example, if white college educated voters get it, but it isn’t understood by others, then throw (1) out the window

@StevenHerbert Would be happy with either.
@StevenHerbert Having the party use the name they use nationally - the constitution party.
@StevenHerbert An enforcement of the principle of voter intent.  We have data now showing that only 3% of these voters can even identify their party as “American Independent” and 78% thought they were registered independent (which is NPP in CA)
@philpaule They could also just require the party to have the same name they do nationally - the Constitution Party
@philpaule Have done some of this and I am sure that it is having some impact on re-registrations, but the rate of mistaken registrations is far exceeding anything that could be done. I can't stand over the shoulders of 1 million new registrants and make sure 50k don't make the mistake.

@maestro876 Yes.  Definitely.  But baseline is 2014 / 2010.  Don’t expect high turnout compared to 2016 when he was actually on the ballot.

@maestro876 Also, it is hard to connect the dots between an assembly district (what is an assemblyman, most Californians would ask) to a driving voting issue like Trump or big nationalized important issues.
@maestro876 Definitely not an issue of low levels of spending.  I would bet more was spent on the average special than most congressional districts around the country.  Our spending on campaigns eclipses spending in other states. 		The lack of Dem/rep competitiveness is probably more of it.

More from the archives.... 2016 Primary @surveyusa thought Latinos would be 30% of that electorate.  They were 20%, which was strong, but not close to their incredibly blind weighting. https://t.co/hqHHLKPa0s
From the archives... before the 2016 General @surveyusa thought Latinos were going to be 31% of voters. They were waaaaaay off. https://t.co/KFVpw91nbd
For those who are concerned, I don't even know who is leading in their poll, or what the results were at all. I can't look past this gross negligence.  It would be journalistic malpractice for any media outlet to give you any publicity, funding, or even look at this garbage.
Yes.  Look at that.  Past four CA gubernatorial primaries have been 11%, 12%, 11%, 12% Latino. The PRESIDENTIAL primary was 20%, and General was record high 23%.
Hey @SurveyUSA, I'm here about to go have dinner, so I don't have time to read your poll, but I gotta say, you've really outdone yourselves!

@AlexHilke @FiveThirtyEight Kinda. You should use similar elections to predict a midterm. So, if we had a special election for Issa’s seat I would say that’s a great predictor for CA.		But in most cases a national race isn’t a good CA bellwether. 		And a #CA34 special doesn’t tell you anything nationally.
@AlexHilke @FiveThirtyEight Well, that primary was also not something with comparing to. Korean turnout defined it more than anything to do with Republicans. These little local specials aren’t driven by national issues.
RT @jodihicks: Kids today...
@AlexHilke @FiveThirtyEight That election had nothing to do with anything.  Was two Democrats on the ballot, so that’s why it was more Dem turnout. Shouldn’t even be used in this kind of analysis.
@AlexHilke Was there a swing in the #CA34 primary?  I think the driver in that race was more about the Korean voters than Trump.  I would bet those Asm special elections are super low turnout and have no measurable Trump effect.
But don’t project directly from a set of elections that have completely different factors than CA and start believing that Dems are gonna run every Republican out of office here. 		There could be some Dem pickups, but it’s not gonna be easy.
And the Republicans who have won CA elections have done so despite continual strong Obama numbers in 2010/2014, and big Dem turnouts in 2012/2016.  		It is fun to look at results in other states where there are plump juicy targets for Dems...
Which is a point I’ve been making for a while. It is fun to compare some metrics from National races to project something in the Golden State, but CA is just different. We don’t have vulnerable Republican majorities. We have Republican super-minorities.
But, back to CA. What was the wave in 2010? CA had the ONLY Dem pickup (congrats @DrPanMD). And while some Reps won in 2014 races, Dems won them them back in 2016.		Have all 1,100 Reps who won based on anti-Obama waves raise their hands, you wouldn’t see one hand raised in CA.
Take away the anti-Obama motivator for Reps and replace that with an anti-Trump motivation for Dems, and you get a wave election nationally that is as strong and impactful as what Reps enjoyed in 2010/2014.		Those 1,100 Reps are basically sitting ducks.
Around the country there are more than 1,100 governors, legislators and members of congress who won in 2010 and 2014 Republican wave elections, and were propped up by a very motivated anti-Obama electorate, the Tea Party activists, etc...
If all CA congressional districts with lower 2016 Trump vote than #PA18 were to flip, then the CA Republican delegation would consist of: 		1) Kevin McCarthy		And that’s it.		But that is also the danger of using a single outcome and applying to CA districts.

@EdEspinoza Haha.
@EdEspinoza Depends on the election. But usually about 20%.  In the 16G I think there were 2.5m uncounted after Eday+1.  Took weeks to finish.
@EdEspinoza In CA they’ll say 100% reporting and then have a million or more absentees to count, and provisionals to verify.
@EdEspinoza are these numbers in Texas pretty close to final, or is TX like CA with 20% or more votes taking days or weeks to get counted?
Important issue, making sure all votes count and non-matching signature policy is standard statewide, with remedies for voters who’s signature doesn’t match for some reason.  Proud to have worked with the @ACLU on the data for this winning case. https://t.co/NoQmhCMN5e

@530BruceRoss Yep.  But the ACS is a small sample survey with a ton more questions. And it isn’t used to calculate the actual number of people for the census, it’s just used for deeper understanding for public policy or research. So not as consequential.

@philpaule @velopol I would agree to that as long as I got an extra 10 minute window to rant about the American Independent Party or @surveyusa
@velopol @philpaule I’m headed out for a ride! #dontbancarbonbikes! https://t.co/daT1KmieLo
@velopol @philpaule I’m happy discussing progress. But I see none at all because people are yelling bumper stickers at each other.
@DChesin @philpaule @velopol Or, even, why should @DChesin trust people who have been arrested for domestic violence, those who have violent history, or on a no-fly list or mentally unstable w/ these weapons?We can’t even get political agreement to take these out of the hands of people we know are dangerous.
@philpaule @velopol Are you upset about not being able to buy a fully automatic weapon?  Or a rocket launcher?  It seems like, without me diving into too much hyperbole, that we already accept some rational and state-interest tailoring of our rights. Isn’t the convo about where we draw the line?
@philpaule Agree. Respect. But different viewpoints. 		But I do wonder how many would participate in a serious buyback program. And I think it would be good for this country to admit that the number of these guns out there isn’t a great thing, and give air for a voluntary process.
@philpaule There is some limited commercial data on that, and I’ve seen polling data and models. But I don’t think it’s like home ownership where we can get public data and match it directly. Would love to though, could make for some interesting polling on views about gun reforms.
@DEANintheYAY I wasn’t only because I’ve seen in past years that there are these cycles... off years have lower partisan registration, more registering NPP, then partisan registration increases closer to the primary.
RT @JonahPaul_: @paulmitche11 Everytime I canvass with PDI and see an AI by a name I ask if they’re aware that AI is a far right segregatio…
@philpaule But, honestly, this is what I would like to see: (1) stop new sales of all automatic weapons and (2) ban person-to-person  sale of these guns, (3) start having a large scale buy-back.		I believe if we could get very far with voluntary buy backs to take these out of circulation.
@philpaule Practical Answer: it barely is worth thinking about since we can’t even restrict new sales to the mentally ill or those on a no-fly list.
@philpaule @velopol I think the US has it all backwards. We ban sex in movies more than violence. Yet, fundamentally, sex is a part of a healthy human existence and violence shouldn’t be. It is worth a lot of introspection.		And we shouldn’t have so many damn automatics weapons floating around.
Republicans and Democrats and American Independents (Oh, My!).   https://t.co/2UfwiT4DZM
I appreciate experiences of @philpaule and @velopol and don’t think they are for gun violence. I honestly think they are disgusted with the violence. But when is the tipping point where good people like them say, “ah, fuck it.  I’m fed up defending this.”  When?  Next time?
My thoughts and prayers are with the millions of normal decent gun rights advocates who should increasingly realize they are on the wrong side of a bloody history in America, but can’t because they’ve spent decades repeating the same tired slogans while more innocent kids die.
@velopol That’s an interesting analogy. I think there have been lots of restrictions on cars, and driving, and licensure and tests and taking driving rights away from drunk drivers even if they didn’t hurt anyone. If we regulated guns like cars I bet this would be a different situation.
@velopol Couldn’t do anything close to that or sandy hook or the Pulse nightclub or the Las Vegas massacre with the shotguns my brother and I had as kids, or any of the guns we were raised around when we lived in good ‘ol Inyo County.
@philpaule Don’t know that’s explicitly required to change gun laws. In fact, I think it’s a bit of a red herring. We can constrain time and place of public speech, regulate other constitutional rights when there is a state interest, and do something to address access to some violent guns.
@velopol Or when I used to have a shotgun in my car when I was 16 and living in Independence? 		Things changed, including that I don’t remember people having assault rifles.		Saying it’s everything but guns seems irrational. I want to stop the violence, and the guns are a part of that.
@velopol Whatever the reason, the tragedies we keep happening wouldn’t be if we had a rational policy with deadly weapons.
@velopol Because they put politics ahead of saving lives? ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
I agree with you, let’s ban both. https://t.co/QQHBBdP0dY

@CAGOPUnknown @scottlay @madrid_mike @MattShupePR @Political_Data Things @Political_Data creates (pollsters and campaigns get) from 30	years of data: past party (if a Dem used to be a Rep, for example), dates voters returned their ballots over past 10 statewide elections, more than can be listed in tweets. I’m gonna have to write an article!
@CAGOPUnknown @scottlay @madrid_mike @MattShupePR @Political_Data Things CA voter file has that many other states don’t: primary vote history, party, phones, emails (almost 7 million), birthplace, birthdate, when a voter requests a partisan ballot (like 16 primary), permanent absentee ballot, if someone has returned a ballot.
@CAGOPUnknown @scottlay @madrid_mike @MattShupePR That’s really only applicable in states with garbage voter registration files.  CA has great voter registration (not just because @Political_Data has been doing these new-fangled voter files for 30 years) but also because we have many more data fields than other states.
@scottlay @CAGOPUnknown @madrid_mike @MattShupePR I would take this thing and turn it around. (Maybe I will for @CA_120) take this data from states that have high quality voter files and show how bad panels are.		In a state without good voter registration files you’re stuck. But anyone in CA should throw this study in the trash.
@scottlay @CAGOPUnknown @madrid_mike @MattShupePR If a panelist says they voted in the 2016 General (which is the socially preferable response, and probably means they will get to do more surveys for $$) isn’t believable. Having it flagged on the voter file is.		This whole thing puts too much trust in panelists. So wackadoodle.
@scottlay @CAGOPUnknown @madrid_mike @MattShupePR First thought: this is bizarre.  Nationally data is a mess, and panels vs voter files is an OK conversation. But for those of us in CA, we all know panels are absolute garbage.		Judging a voter file against a panel, like the panel is perfect, is just wackadoodle.

Before the legislature releases information on dozens of sexual harassment claims, can they give a head's up about who exactly we're talking about so folks can go in and delete some old tweets, facebook and instagram posts?		#AskingForAFriend https://t.co/B0SUROdcgJ
Summary:		The really creepy attention-seeking Carter Page was surveilled based on a warrant that didn't say that the source was a Democratic-funded opposition research file (after it was a Republican-funded research file).		All before Mueller became special prosecutor.		got it.
Prediction:		Today it will be made public that a legislator had eight sexual harassment claims filed against them. 		30-seconds later: someone will text me and say “omg, who knew?”		.00005 seconds later: I will throw my phone against a wall.
It’s always those who think “what I do is so cool and unique that nobody could do what I do” who then turn around and say “that thing they do is so easy, I could totally do what they do”.		Rarely are either true.
Someone is going to accuse the legislature of timing the release of these sexual harassment files for the same time as the @DevinNunes memo media firestorm.		But, in fairness, when could you schedule something these days and not have it coincide with something shocking out of DC?

@maestro876 @kkondik Two points on that:  		1) I just grabbed one of the likely voter universes that shows the best likely composition of the electorate. The one pollsters use. Not meant to be a prediction of actual turnout. 		2) in CA turnout in 2017 has been dismal.
@brian_weisel @kkondik Well, that’s a different kettle of fish. 		I strongly believe the current construction of the Gov race leans against a Dem Dem runoff, despite soooo many politicos who think that will happen. 		But, if that happens every Republican will be in very choppy uncharted waters. 🌊
@kkondik No real top two dynamics given that this seat will have a Dem/Rep runoff 99% of the time.		But ethnicity could be a major factor. Some major candidates are Vietnamese but the district is pretty white. 18% Latino LVs, Asian LV is 15% &amp; mostly Chinese. https://t.co/MJHCJpRxKI
@kkondik Yep.  Even if you apply a 10-15 point Democratic wave, wouldn’t be an easy pickup for Democrats. But an open seat might be marginally easier. 		One tiny note: all those statewide Dems were from LA / SF. Give a couple points to an Orange County candidate, maybe.

@velopol If I was a corporate CEO I would surely be doing some of this just for good PR.  I’m sure it’s a fraction of what they’re getting from the tax plan. (At least that’s what the cynic in me thinks)
@ccadelago @aacosta30 I’m counting on it. Narrowing and coalescing should be the #1 and #2 strategic goals for 14 Rep members, their donors, Paul Ryan and Brulte. 		Note: All people who couldn’t really have cared less about getting a Rep in the US Senate race. In fact, not having one saved them money!
@ccadelago @aacosta30 Definitely. The field matters a ton.  And, the fact that in 16 there was little consequence if a Republican didn't make the runoff.  In 2018, for Republicans, that could be the whole ballgame. Imagine how vulnerable the Rep congressional delegation would be if that happened!

@JacobThompFish @XfinityXvantage Update: https://t.co/HUQdd69VwL
Where I diverge from the growing political consensus:		(A) Dems winning CA congressional seats held by Republicans is gonna be tough.		(B) The Nov runoff for Governor will be Dem vs Rep.		However, if I’m wrong on (B) then (A) is wrong too. Then all 14 Rep members are vulnerable.
@velopol On balance I think you’re right. But they would have benefited more if they were in another state, right?  I know I personally benefit.
Does one election make a 🌊?  		And if a wave were to wipe out every single Republican who flipped a Dem legislative or congressional seat in 2010 and 2014 (there are hundreds) just how many would that mean in CA?   		Answer: zero. 		https://t.co/vd0tkGRGnH

@Dsquared75 @amyewalter Also, the voter file is a lagging indicator of the demographic changes. The state has become increasingly Latino, but the voter file has gone from 23% Latino in 2012, 24% Latino in 2014, nearly 25% Latino in 2016.  That’s what I mean  by slow.
@Dsquared75 @amyewalter That’s a generous count. And, remember, OC voted Democratic for the first time in I dunno how long... maybe ever... in 2016. And all the OC Reps survived.
@116deerfield @amyewalter My daughter likes to “memitate” and I’m not gonna correct her! https://t.co/2A76FWh9rv
@Dsquared75 @amyewalter Yes, changing, but slowly. And with so few Republican held seats (about 1/4) it’s not like there’s a lot of GOP growth from 2010/2014 cycles that gets “corrected” in CA like I expect in other states.
@hezaproject @SeanTrende How many in CA. The state seemed like an outlier in 2006 with only one Dem pickup, and an outlier again in 2010 with zero Republican pickups. 		In the abstract I would think that seats that were 2010 pickups would be more vulnerable (aside from redistricting impacts).
@amyewalter In California, only one Democratic gain in 2006 wave, zero Republican gains in 2010 wave (Dems actually gained a seat in the state legislature). Those 🌊 elections had little CA impact.  Same to be expected in 2018?
@amyewalter Can we get in iPad adjusted minutes?

Stands to reason in the abstract that our “wave” isn’t going to be as impactful as the rest of the US since we didn’t see a Rep wave in 2010 or 14

@BlameTheWhales @CA_120 Sure. But that would be much greater turnout disparity than even in the 2016 primary when there was a competitive Dem presidential race and Trump had already locked up the Republican side (and Cruz/Kasich and the whole gang had all dropped out)

@SeanMcElwee @maestro876 The article I linked is about the Open Primary and pushing against the growing narrative that the Gov race will be Dem on Dem.  But your point could also be true, even if a Rep makes the Gov runoff. We don't see many strong Rep statewide candidates - and none in US Sen race yet.
@SeanMcElwee @maestro876 https://t.co/54WYihth2b
Pre-Alabama in the set of races analyzed Democratic performance was 10-points over 2016 Presidential, 13.5% over baseline. Post Alabama that goes up to 15.4% over Pres./17.8% over baseline.		Alabama was an outlier, but not an outlier that breaks against the national trend. https://t.co/rWU1PnrtWC

No. It. Wasn’t.  		Exit polling (which is historically really bad at subgroup calculations) says African Americans were a larger share of the votes cast. But “turnout” for all groups was lower than in any presidential election and total turnout was only 35%. https://t.co/kU5a316P8t
@jbpollster I think the jury is more out on that one. Definitely worth keeping an eye on... and if there were new Bannon-esque candidates lined up for those seats there would be a more direct lesson from tonight. 		We will be watching those closely!!!
@jbpollster Totally.  Those are the elections that have lessons for 2018. We agree on that.
@jbpollster There is a national turnout story, but this election is that plus a whole lot more external factors. You gimme 100 Alabama senate races and even with this Democratic wave, Reps win 99 times (this result being the 1).  Right?
Now the pent up anxiety of Democrats nationally starts flooding my timeline with “what this means”-isms for 2018. 		This does change the Senate map by one seat, but Moore was uniquely the most unqualified candidate of our lifetime. So, temper that projection to other races a bit.

@scottlay @chandrasharma @MattRexroad Just saying that for those looking for evidence of a wave in CA, there is none yet. And past “wave” elections have had a muted effect in our state. Looking for evidence outside of CA? Yes, it is there. Inside CA? No evidence.
@scottlay @chandrasharma @MattRexroad Yes, but the other 2017 races across the country, special elections, city council, etc... those show waves but CA34, LA Mayor, AD51, other races in 2017 didn’t.
@chandrasharma @MattRexroad @scottlay Could make a cogent argument, but without any actual data backing it up. 		In other states we have evidence of a wave based on dozens of races from congress to city council. But, in CA all 2017 elections have been extremely low wave-free turnout.
Exactly.		And, ironically, many of the contests in 2016 were analyzed using 2014 turnout models. (That’s why a bunch of east coast politicos were shocked by how close some of the races were in 2016.  And now they are making the same skewed interpretation, in the inverse) https://t.co/oedLFgqdaD

@ElectProject The one I’m working on now I have to meet with the registrar to discuss. But it looks like when the agency grew in a few places the registrar was just putting those new areas into the same district, no matter if it was smack in the middle of another.
@ElectProject Two were from projects in 2012... I can look for them. I just saw post-Redistricting that the county had been using bad lines, sweeping in a number of districts.
@ElectProject I think the problem is worse (albeit still tiny) at the local level since the small jurisdictions often try to Redistrict not knowing what they are doing, or using city planner who aren’t familiar with the census geographies so mess things up.
How common is this?  I have done three local Redistrictings in California where I found full precincts assigned to the wrong districts.

I’m very grateful for @WeSaidEnough . It is tough to hear when we’re talking about our friends &amp; colleagues, but we need to end the Omertà.
@JamusLynch @RobStutzman Now you’re pandering!
@JamusLynch Love him, but @RobStutzman isn’t a real voter.  Most partisans will vote for whoever has their D or R next to their name.
@JamusLynch @CAGOP That prob doesn’t hurt them in primaries - could even energize the base. Impact probably greater on general elections, esp in 2020.
@JamusLynch I won’t be making bets on Sen race until we see the field, but the numbers say it is a remote, remote possibility, despite happening in 2016
@JamusLynch Yeah, well, 2016 was unique, Rep Primary cratered after trump locked it up, and field grew to 34 candidates, plus Reps wanted a Dem/Dem.
But the idea that these races go Dem-Dem in 2018 is an endemic fallacy. Needs a bit more critical analysis.

@wccubbison I agree with that guess.
