#BettisShow Topic: @AntonioBrown84 and Josh Norman matchup.
@weckerly_tori I think the @Ravens will be a good team but not good enough to make the playoffs.
@ErinNDudley69 I agree @Bengals will be in the hunt for the division and will be the steelers biggest competition!
#BettisShow Topic: Who do you think will be the @steelers biggest competition this season?
#BettisShow Topic: @JJames18_ is a weapon in the red zone. He's a big body and has good hands. If he gets open Ben will find him!
We remember. Thinking of all the precious lives we lost on this day 15 years ago. #NeverForget 🇺🇸🇺🇸
