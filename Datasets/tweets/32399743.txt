After being around them, then u need to protect urself! Ur energy is urs 2 guard-  don't funnel it 2wards ppl that suck u dry. #vampire
"Energy vampire" - ppl who leech positive energy from u and leave behind toxic emotions. If a person (or place) makes u feel worse (cont.)
Give specific, meaningful praise to ur partner "U r such a great dad- our kids r so lucky to have u."  or "Ur new aftershave is SEXY" #love

If ur sex life is at the bottom of ur to-do list, then ur relationship is 2. Make time 4 intimacy or u will feel the impact in ur #marriage
Soap is to the body what tears are to the soul. (Jewish proverb.) #quote #jewish #wisdom #cry #tgif
When u screw up -Saying "I'm sorry" is #1. Then, "How can I help?" Then- allow urself grace &amp; let it go. Ur shame helps noone #forgive
Self-care is sacred-even 4 mums/dads. When our kids see us taking care of our bodies and our spirits, it teaches them to do the same. #kids
Did your parents make u feel like u were inadequate? Today my blog is on this very topic: https://t.co/fwIi5vWb6q #parents #kids #worthy
when u wont ask for help, u deny ur loved ones a chance to be helpful. instead, allow them to be of service. this is a gift for u both. #ask
Don't make jokes about how ur husband is not good w the kids. It makes him feel useless. Appreciate his effort, even u can "do it better."

They say in AA - ur either working on a relapse or on a recovery. True for love too- ur marriage is either getting better or getting worse.
Just in case you needed to hear this 2day: There's nothing wrong with you. You are not broken. #LoveYourself #noshame
A successful woman is one who can build a firm foundation with the bricks others have thrown at her. #fierce #dontbackdown
Transparency builds trust--u shouldn't have 2 hide your screen when ur partner walks in or keep passwords from each other. #dating #married
Don't resist sadness. Allow it. Running from pain only allows it to grow. Don't label emotions as "good" or "bad" - all are necessary. #feel
Challenge: Send your partner a sexy text while at work today. "I can't wait to get u alone 2nite." or more X rated! #marriage #love #sex
Your task is not to seek for love, but merely to seek and find all the barriers within yourself that you have built against it. #quote #love

"Hope is not about proof - it's about believing that love is stronger than any s*%# life can throw at us." #quote #truth #wise #love #hope
Thank ur partner 4 somethin he did n the past ("thx for making Sunday dinner!") it means so much- shows u appreciate deeply. #marriage
The worst way 2 apologize "I'm sorry if I hurt you." Try "I see that I really hurt you. That wasnt my intention. How can I make it better?"
