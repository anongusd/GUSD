@TimothyBalding Well, Macron turned directions yesterday in his speech before Congress so he will be on Trump's shit list soon if not already.  Macron wants a revision but a continuance of the Iran deal.  We will see if his visit changed Trump's mind on May 12th.  I sort of doubt though?
@TimothyBalding Macron seemed to turn the tables in his speech before Congress today.  So perhaps you are right . . . he is smarter than he appeared yesterday with his awkward bromance with Trump?   But I don't think Trump gives a shit anyhow.
@TimothyBalding For one, it is political suicide for Macron because the French hate Trump and President Fubar will not commit to anything  Macron wants.  Further, we have a negative trade balance with France and after their failure in 2003 to support us with Iraq in 2003, who needs them?
