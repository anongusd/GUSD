We might have just had “the year of the woman” but we can’t limit women’s involvement, and influence to just one year. #CountMeIn
I’m excited to share with you that through our new @MainStreetGOP #Women initiative, I plan to travel across the country and help encourage the rise of more #GOP female candidates.
A huge piece of this puzzle can be solved during the primary season. We have to encourage everyone, from small-dollar donors to major funders, to support candidates – but especially FEMALE ones – during the primary season.
The number of #GOPwomen in the U.S. House has almost reached World War II levels. We can do better. If we really want to help more women get to #congress, the Republican Party needs to open its checkbooks and put our money where our mouth is.
