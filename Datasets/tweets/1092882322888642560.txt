@MaloneyforNY Just saw you trying to undermine Martha MacCallum on Fox news with your multiple interruptions. You a nothing but a left wing blow hard like Pelosi and Schumer and democrats refuse to secure our borders because they want the flood of fraudulent voters.

@SenatorBennet TPS was never meant to be permanent and we did these people a favor by letting them come here short term. When a party only gives a damn about votes to keep them in power, it is time for them to go.
@SenatorBennet The left wing media is an enemy of the people and our country.
@SenatorBennet Obama did nothing to stop Chinese abuse of trade. Thank God we have a president who really cares about the American people. You are shameful Bennet and I pray you lose in the next election.
@SenatorBennet @realDonaldTrump What the American voters want is the surge of illegal democrat voters to stop foreign intervention into our election. Texas governor reports that he has proof that 95000 illegal aliens are registered to vote there. Democrats are corrupt Senator Bennet.
@SenatorBennet Just heard you say that these investigations into President Trump will continue. What I can tell you senator is that the American people are sick and tired of democrats wasting millions of taxpayers dollars because they cannot get over the fact that Hillary lost.

You are absolutely right, but liberals are blind, deaf, and dumb. https://t.co/57gAAazSLq
@rolandscahill @realDonaldTrump You obviously support mass illegal immigration so what the hell difference does it make to you? Reasoning with a liberal is like spitting into the wind.
@eugenegu @realDonaldTrump Do you support killing a baby after it is born? NY and Virginia sure do.
@eugenegu @realDonaldTrump Is that why we have 22 million illegals in our country and they are a huge voting base for democrats. I would expect more intelligence from a doctor, but unfortunately you have been liberally indoctrinated in college.
@EdKrassen @realDonaldTrump You are full of crap. Maybe you should give up watching the Communist News Network CNN.
@krassenstein @realDonaldTrump You are about as simple minded as they come dude. Walls work and who cares what you think. Does mass immigration help the environment??? Wake up!!!

@fmanjoo @nytimes Most of them are liberals so get rid of them all.
@SenJeffMerkley @SenatorMarkey @AOC What you really mean is bankrupt America and hurt the least able to pay higher energy costs. You are an ignorant man.
@SenFeinstein Why don't you get out and let some young person get in with some new ideas. Democrats are so frigging stupid and you take the cake. You better thank GOD you live in crazy land.
@SenatorDurbin @PostOpinions Dickie 73% of viewers loved Trump's speech and his policies on illegal immigration. No doubt Republicans will take back the house and Trump will win re-election. Democrats live in an alternate universe on a different planet.
@PattyMurray More fear mongering Patty? I was a federal employee and could have survived for a year without pay. Nothing like a free vacation on the back of the taxpayers. You democrats are sickening.

@nytimes Watch out Billie Bob Clinton.
@nytimes All of the democrat crooks.
@CNN Who gives a crap about Trumps returns. No democrat out there is smart enough to know what is in them. IRS audits him every year.
@NewDay @CNN @JohnAvlon More Russia bullshit by democrats. They should have to pay back all of these legal costs after they find nothing. Schiff lies about everything and is wrong about everything.
@CNN @ForecasterEnten His gaffes would destroy him.
@NYTScience @nytimes Democrats wait until they are born and then murder them. Infanticide!!!!
@CNN Schiff is a lying dog looking for a job at CNN. He would fit right in.
@CNN I watched Martha question her. Sure looked plagiarized to me.
@CNN We need a NATIONAL VOTER ID to keep illegal aliens from voting in our national elections. Texas found 95000 registered illegals voting.
@leahegriffin @PattyMurray @Alyssa_Milano The one who survived the Lt Governor in Virginia??? A democrat by the way.
@fams2gether @SenJeffMerkley The first mistake you made was talking to Salon.
@SenBlumenthal Hey Dickie been to Vietnam lately. Republicans never obstructed like you democrat clowns.
@SenatorDurbin @NewDayCNN Republicans never pulled this crap on Obama. TERM LIMITS DURBIN!!!!
@JMurguia_Unidos @PattyMurray You would think she would keep better company than a baby murderer.
@nytimes Ah the Virginia race baiting democrats and also baby murderers.
@SenJeffMerkley Another democrat supporting illegal aliens. Don't Americans pay this clown.
@denverpost He already lost once. Democrats are destroying Colorado.
@Phil_Mattingly @ChrisCoons This surprises who?????? Democrats don't want law and order.
@MomsDemand @ChrisMurphyCT Gun control nut cases like Murphy are just trying to disarm America. Talk about a tyrannical senator.
@lisamurkowski @SenatorCantwell @Sen_JoeManchin As the RINO speaks. Siding with democrats insures a bad bill.
@ChrisCoons What are you going to do Coons, Kavanaugh him. He should sail through with his previous record. Stop the obstructionist BS.
@Kidfears99 @timkaine @PattyMurray This has been going on for years so why didn't he worry about it when Obama was president? Virginia democrats are looking pretty bad right now.
@sfpelosi @SenJeffMerkley Arrogant 78 year old witch who should let new ideas come into the party. TERM LIMITS WILL SAVE US!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
@CNN Why do we have the worst science and math scores in the world and spend more than all other countries. TEACHERS UNION!!!!
@WTNH @ChrisMurphyCT Why didn't they worry about this when Obama was president?
@NYTScience @nytimes Yes from turning illegal aliens loose into our country with no medical check. Thank your  democrat friends for this.
@CNN The liberal loonies are running the show so what else would you expect. They will be gone in  2020.
@sksierra1 @KRDONC13 They are all coming for legal weed. The scumbags are flooding into our state.
@CNN @ForecasterEnten The king of gaffes.
@CNN Why were most of the records set in the early 1900's. Follow the money and you will understand while liberals support this BS.
@SenJeffMerkley Why don't you talk about all of the children put in cages by Obama. You worthless hypocrite!!!
@CNN Mass illegal immigration without a medical checkup. Same thing happening in the Pacific Northwest because of sanctuary cities.
@SenatorCantwell Got nothing to do with race. If you have a lousy credit score they turn you down. Is race and the war on women all you got Cantwell?????
@SenWhitehouse Do you ever do anything but piss and moan Whitehouse. How about earning your $174,000 salary and elite benefits package by doing the job you were hired to do. Protecting the American people!!!!!!!!
@nytimes The left wing nut cases strike again.
@CNN How many forms will eventually come out? They all lie so many positions will soon be open. Lizzie doesn't have a prayer against Trump.
@SenatorDurbin Nobody cares what you do Dickie. If he was an illegal alien you would push him right through.
@PattyMurray If it wasn't for you obstructionist democrats Trump would have kept all of his promises. Sad that you want open borders so Hispanics will vote fraudulently for you. There are 95000 in Texas alone.
@PattyMurray You don't remember the disaster Obamacare???? How sad that you have to lie to get the uninformed to vote for you.
@SenFeinstein You have the toughest guns laws in the nation and still have mass shootings so what the hell are you talking about. The second amendment was adopted to allow citizens to fight a tyrannical government like democrats are pushing.
@PattyMurray What's the matter Patty will he shut down you fraudulent voting base? Ninety five thousand illegals voting in Texas!!!!!! You are dead wrong, as usual.
@SenFeinstein Maybe you should talk about the millions the Obama's spent going to Hawaii on separate planes. You are an outrageous hypocrite. Trump donates his salary to good causes, what do you do?????
@PattyMurray Patty you must be looking in the mirror.
@SenStabenow What a disgraceful display by democrats. You all should be ashamed.
@CNN I have heard that Schumer is the most corrupt politician in NY. Why don't we investigate him??????
@SenFeinstein Old politicians like you should be term limited. You have lost your way lady.
@PattyMurray At least they don't want to murder already born babies. You are a sick sadistic woman Murray. Do you ever smile or are you afraid your face would crack????
RT @realDonaldTrump: ....The Dems and their committees are going ‚Äúnuts.‚Äù The Republicans never did this to President Obama, there would be‚Ä¶
RT @realDonaldTrump: Democrats at the top are killing the Great State of Virginia. If the three failing pols were Republicans, far stronger‚Ä¶
@JohnTweddle3 Speak for yourself John. Socialism destroys people.
@KGalliah @DevinNunes @HouseDemocrats You must believe that leaker and LIAR Schiff??? I feel sorry for you.
Wonder why we have 22 trillion in debt????? https://t.co/EAhQgudJYI
@JohnTweddle3 Anyone else sick of this CNN BS? Do they really pay those commentators on their news? Must really suck to be you John.
@realitycheckme1 @realDonaldTrump You sound like the lying Lizzie Warren.
@JohnTweddle3 Nice try John you failed again.
@JohnTweddle3 Is that why he gives his salary to worthy causes? You are living in some alternate universe dude.
@realitycheckme1 @LindseyGrahamSC And you do??????
@KGalliah Why don't you talk about the separation under Obama, Oh I forgot that it does not fit your left wing agenda. Watching the LIARS at CNN??????????
@chonesudive They do nothing for Vets unless the government pays them. Thank you Goodell.
@MCMLXXXI_ME Another America hater. What about the justice reform just signed into law? Football is for entertainment not political protests. Get a life.
@realitycheckme1 @SenBobCorker @JoeBiden No wonder this country is screwed up by liberals and RINOs like you.
@JohnTweddle3 So you support brutal dictators? WOW!!!!
@realitycheckme1 @HouseDemocrats @SpeakerPelosi So you are OK with killing babies after they are born? You are an evil sadistic human.
@realitycheckme1 WOW look at all of the democrat hypocrites who actually wore blackface.
@realitycheckme1 @MarshaBlackburn Ever thought about a mental checkup?
@KGalliah @DevinNunes @HouseDemocrats You support that lying Shitt from California??? WOW!!! Liberal ignorance is mind numbing.
Right on John. https://t.co/6uWjD7sx13
@JohnTweddle3 Cardona is just another CNN left wing talking piece. Sigh!!!!
@realitycheckme1 @maddow Another left wing conspiracy theory. Wake up!!!
@martinzjo Warren claimed to be an American Indian and now we have documented proof that she used it to her advantage.
@realitycheckme1 @HouseDemocrats @SpeakerPelosi How sad that you actually believe that democrat propaganda. Abortion has gone way beyond a woman's right to choose. Murder???????
@NFL @HarrisonNFL If it wasn't for these incompetent NFL officials the Chiefs and Saints would have been in the super bowl.
@WhiteHouse @POTUS You are the best Kellyanne. Keep up the good work and call out these crazy radical democrats.
@nytimes This woman should have to pay back all of the government money she got when she lied about being a native American. Democrats should be proud that there are enough stupid Americans out there who will vote for them.
@SenatorDurbin @SenDuckworth When are you going to be held accountable for supporting illegal aliens over the people who pay your salary? You probably support infanticide to, don't you Dickie????
@SenFeinstein You are lying just like you lied about Justice Kavanaugh. How can you live with yourself after what you did to him????
@CNNnewsroom @CNN @zbyronwolf That is what happens in business, get rid of the slugs and hire good people. Obama kept all of the slugs and we all know how that turned out.
@CNNPolitics @cnnbrk What will all of the Trump haters at CNN do when he is re-elected? Psychiatric exam???
@CNN As usual CNN goes into the sewer.
@CNN It would be awful to work for CNN and never be able to tell the truth. Just ask Donnie Lemon.
@AFJustice @SenBlumenthal @LambdaLegal @WhyCourtsMatter @civilrightsorg @peoplefor @endrapeoncampus @knowyourIX @NARAL @Earthjustice Tell us about the time you fought in Vietnam. NOT!!!!
@PattyMurray The voters are sick of democrats fear mongering.
