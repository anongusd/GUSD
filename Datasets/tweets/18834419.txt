Michael‚Äôs pressure (919 millibars), however, was lower than Hurricane Andrew.  		This pressure makes Michael the third lowest pressure ever measured in a US landfalling hurricane behind only the Labor Day Hurricane of 1935 and Hurricane Camille in 1969.

Their condition indicates they've been subjected for a "prolonged period of time," she said. #CNN
The DPSS does not yet know exactly how long the victims of the Perris torture investigation were subjected to being held captive, according to spokesperson Susan Von Zabern.
There were 3 individuals who were chained to some type of furniture. David Allen Turpin &amp; Louise Anna Turpin are the biological parents of all the children, Fellows said. The family previously lived in nearby Murrieta, CA and have earlier ties to Texas, Fellows said.
Upon entering the Perris home where 13 children were held captive, Riverside County Sheriff deputies found a 17-year-old who appeared to be 10 years old, said RCSD Captain Greg Fellows. "I would call that torture," he said.
Riverside County Sheriff deputies did not have any prior contact with David Allen Turpin and Louise Anna Turpin, the couple accused of holding their children captive in their Perris, CA home -- according to RCSD Captain Greg Fellows.

if you go to a state with a beach, visit it. even if you live in a state with a beach.
leave your work phone off and in your bag (or at home). 	work should be left at work!	this is a vacation.
waffle house, while tasty, should never be eaten before a plane ride.
waffle house is sometimes an acceptable substitute for dinner. and lunch. and breakfast.
renting a car and driving across a state is sometimes cheaper than flying to where you want to go.
never eat at the airport Chili's. 	ever.

Without metrics properly defined, they might not be telling you what you want to know.	#ONAUncon #ONA15
Step 6	-Go out and make it happen!	#ONAUncon #ONA15 	All previous info via @NikiDoyle
Step 5: Recommend	-How can you take advantage of positive trends, reverse negative trends?	-Write short grafs on findings.	#ONAUncon #ONA15
Step 5: Recommend	-All steps are meant to lead to the Holy Grail: Actionable analytics. A data table isn't the answer.	#ONAUncon #ONA15
A "but" example:	-Placement mattered even more than hed. (3/2 haha)	#ONAUncon #ONA15
A "but" example: 	-Catchy heds consistently outperformed traditional straight-news heds, no matter location. (2/2)	#ONAUncon #ONA15
A "but" example:	-Feature story on home page will get more PVs.	-Often yes, but: Headline mattered (1/2)	#ONAUncon #ONA15
Step 4: Challenge	-Look for the "but." What are the _exceptions_ to the rule? 	#ONAUncon #ONA15
Step 4: Challenge 	What assumptions do content creators make of your audience? 	Does data back up assumptions?	#ONAUncon #ONA15

Step 3: Automate	You can't automate enough! Great time saver! Maybe IT dep't can help!	#ONAUncon #ONA15
Step 2: Define	-What is "local audience." DMA, city?	-Who is "loyal" visitor	-Any calculated metrics you should consider? 	#ONAUncon #ONA15
Step 1: Prioritize	-Be honest abt needs	-Eliminate/reduce unused reports	-Set goals, track them	-Met the goals? Reevaluate!	#ONAUncon #ONA15
Biggest challenge: TIME!	Newsrooms need data fast... so how can we respond to those needs?	#ONAUncon #ONA15
Challenges:	-Lack of data. budget, tool limits	-Conflicts between departmental needs. Pageviews v. site loyalty	#ONAUncon #ONA15
Challenged for analysts:	-feeding the beast	-abundance of data. some tools offer seemingly never ending combos of metrics.	#ONAUncon #ONA15

@amnewsboy @WmMaxWalker oh. that kind of extrication. shoot. did you get a good response? i'm clueless here.
@amnewsboy cut out? remove? pulled?
@feedly don't know which it was that did the trick, but we're good. thanks for actually answering your twitter feed! happy user!
@feedly it works. here's what i did: cleared browsing hist, cookies &amp; other site data, cache, data from hosted apps, content licenses.
@feedly i even "cleared all data from hosted apps" when i cleaned out my browser. still no response from login.
@feedly re-installed extension, restarted chrome, erased all history/cookies. no change.
@feedly hi! can't skype. at work! but i did take this screencap of the problem if it helps. http://t.co/eGfQhNiCHe
Hey @feedly I can't log in! Having problems? Chrome tells me the page isn't available?!
