@lonniejr Yeah today‚Äôs mentions are gonna be fun. Luckily I have a show to record so will be offline this afternoon :)
‚ÄúToo devestating‚Äù not ‚Äúto‚Äù ugh.
According to National Registry of Exonerations, innocent black people are 7x more likely to be convicted of murder than innocent white people. Half of all those exonerated for rape were black men originally convicted for raping white women via an ‚Äúeyewitness‚Äù identification.
What I‚Äôm trying to say here is that there IS an epidemic of false crime reports ‚Äî you may have seen some of the coverage: ‚ÄúPermit Patty,‚Äù ‚ÄúBarbeque Becky,‚Äù and dozens of other hoaxes to devestating to get a cutesy nickname. It‚Äôs white people that need rein themselves in.
@OrinHite @QuantumWrangler @donttrythis Exactly. YES, PLEASE, *punish people who falsely report crimes,* because it might stop a lot of arrests for ‚Äúexisting while black.‚Äù
@CampbellVideos I cited Russell-Brown because she called for  higher penalties against hoaxes decades ago ‚Äî I think the age of the citation makes it more relevant, not less!
@CampbellVideos LOL it‚Äôs not the only book on the subject! Just the most influential!  :)
*mad* not ‚Äúmade‚Äù sigh.

Are you made Jussie Smollett wasted police resources? Do you think there should be high penalties for false crime reports? OK! One study found *70% of false crime reports are white people citing black attackers.* Black people have been hoping for a crack down on this *for years.*

Now for the segment where they read the tweets about the show. Bolling answers a question about the presidents mood with an anecdote about the last time he saw the Prez, in ‚Äúthe oval,‚Äù after the Pelosi business. It is true this is not coverage you get elsewhere.
@GaryLegum Did you catch their back and forth confirming the largeness of Trump‚Äôs hands!?
In-house ad for "Rant Nation,‚Äù which the host describes as ‚Äúpro- everything patriotic.‚Äù		Bolling boasts that we‚Äôre just getting a taste of the variety of opinions at the Blaze: 		"We have middle conservative, far left conservative or far right conservative--whatever that means."
@GaryLegum It's amazing.

@4lgsgood @Frank66Stanton Yeah there's a writing project percolating.

Parts of the Skyway are also designated as warming stations, so, again, take the time to acknowledge someone's humanity. Full area list here: https://t.co/9alpti0hEy

Also, I just donated to your Patreon; you‚Äôll be in my thoughts.
The real baller move for a news organization to pull here would be to *refuse to participate* in these charades and instead use its resources to investigate what‚Äôs actually happening as a result of Trump‚Äôs already-enacted policies (and ‚Äúrule changes‚Äù).

@mathowie @ParkerMolloy If he could name the three branches of government I would eat my hat (as pictured).
And I cannot emphasize this enough: It would be GREAT if reporters would use these rare opportunities to ask Trump procedural questions rather than trolly/gotcha ones. ‚ÄúCould you explain what you mean when you say _______ (insert almost any goddamn thing)?‚Äù
@ParkerMolloy I think you and I have agreed in the past that it would be VERY USEFUL for reporters to ask Trump basic procedural/factual questions. I am, for instance, very eager to know if he really thinks stealth jets are *invsisible.*
Upon reflection: 1) I was being facetious in saying it‚Äôs ‚Äúfun‚Äù to freak out, tho I do think there is a thrill to being outraged that we should all be wary of. 2) We should definitely *be alarmed* that Trump says this stuff, no matter how the thoughts enter his tiny brain.
@ToddLMay @minakimes @SarahSpain YES, DEFINITELY will be inviting Sarah on!
@notcawri On some level I think there is a visceral‚Ä¶ excitement? Not ‚Äúfun‚Äù per se, but it‚Äôs definitely CLICKY AND OUTRAGEOUS. Not for the people actually effected by the policy, of c.
Some of Trump‚Äôs worst policy excesses come at the urging of journalists eager to fluff the news cycle: the NYT asking if Mueller investigating his family finances would be a ‚Äúred line‚Äù and, more recently, Axios‚Äô prodding him into a pronoucement about birthright citizenship.
I know it‚Äôs fun to freak out over Trump saying stuff like ‚ÄúI could declare a national emergency and build the wall if I wanted to‚Äù BUT: DJT was essentially trolled into that assertion by a reporter. I am not convinced he knew that declaring a national emergency was an option!

@thesarahrose I‚Äôm there!
@cmclymer Mainly bc I wind up giving 90% to a thrift store or donating them elsewhere, 80% of which I suspect they are eventually junked (MAYBE recycled). If you want a physical galley, great, I am not against them being available! But they shouldn‚Äôt be the thing most widely distributed.

@mjgesme @dudelove88 Yup, two different groups :) And you can be in Al-Anon without your mom being sober or in recovery at all.
@mjgesme @dudelove88 Al-Anon is the fellowship *especially for* the friends and loved ones of an addict/alcoholic! It was founded by the wife of the founder of AA, and it uses the same principles as a structure for practicing self-care and good boundaries! I‚Äôm sorry I didn‚Äôt make that clear!
@mjgesme @DebCurry5 I really understand this position‚Ä¶ which is why I didn‚Äôt and won‚Äôt suggest letting go completely. But letting go *of the outcome* is important, as is the knowledge this intervention is something you are doing for yourself (and your niece), not her. Wishing you all peace‚Ä¶

@smallweirdnumbr Yeah that‚Äôs why I don‚Äôt have people on whose opinions I find awful. What I refer to here is the email I get from people asking about this problem in their own lives.
@crooked_friends Our relationship reminds me that there are very few of us that are beyond the reach of acceptance and even redemption. It may take a miracle to change their minds but luckily I believe in those, too. /7
@crooked_friends And probably the most controversial point I‚Äôll make: I continue down this road in part because I do get something out of having my in-laws in my life, I mean, beyond more Christmas presents and family harmony. They‚Äôre generous people who love me despite *my* outspoken views. /6
@crooked_friends For me, ‚Äúwhat I can live with‚Äù can probably be short handed to ‚Äúnot hiding my own views but also not picking fights.‚Äù I am privileged that *who I am* isn‚Äôt a problem for my FiL. (I‚Äôm cis, white, able-bodied, etc.) My hope is to use that privilege rather than hide behind it. /5
@crooked_friends And I want to not be on auto-pilot about our differences. He may someday say something that crosses a line; I may have to tag out of visits. But I also want to be there for my nieces &amp; nephew, to be one of the few people in their lives who doesn‚Äôt think like their grandpa. /4
@crooked_friends I consider it something of a success that he knows that someone in his life who he loves and respects finds what he has to say not just wrong but *offensive.* But I also know I‚Äôll never change his mind. /3
@crooked_friends Everyone‚Äôs calculus is different, but the general math ends in figuring out what you can live with, just for today. My in-laws are Trump supporters; my FiL likes to get under my skin. Sometimes I argue with him. Sometimes I leave the room. /2
If there‚Äôs one thing doing @crooked_friends has taught me, it‚Äôs that there‚Äôs no one right answer for how to deal with people you love who hold views that don‚Äôt align with yours. Arguing and shunning have their place! (And aren‚Äôt incompatible with continuing to love someone.) /1

Hutchison won by 2,340 votes and spent $38,000 on the race. Three-term incumbent Stanek spent $270,000. EVERY VOTE MATTERS. Way to go, adopted hometown. XO.
A video of the incumbents‚Äô deputies beating protesters at Standing Rock was deemed ‚Äútoo violent‚Äù to run as an ad on Facebook: https://t.co/EjN0Y1sBiD
An under-the-radar, not-decided-on-Election-Day droplet to add to the blue wave: here in MNPLS, an anti-ICE reformer candidate (Dave Hutchison) beat out the conservative incumbent (who, among other things, was a guest at Trump‚Äôs WH and sent officers to ‚Äúhelp‚Äù at Standing Rock).

And do the daily things, too: say something when a colleague makes a racist comment. Wear a #BLM pin. /2

The WH stopped doing daily briefings months ago so I don‚Äôt think this is it. https://t.co/8YmKWAPCka

I have been arguing that the WH beat is a waste of talent *for years,* but then it was just kind of sad, now I think it‚Äôs actively *bad for democracy.* CNN suing the WH plays into Trump‚Äôs tiny hands: When someone is throwing a tantrum, the solution isn‚Äôt more attention.
A better punishment for the WH would be for CNN to *stop sending its reporters.* Put those resources to use covering maternal health crisis, the addiction epidemic, corruption, the stuff Trump *doesn‚Äôt want covered.* A lawsuit is just more oxygen to the gas fire.

@JeffSharlet If I had a dollar for each time I heard someone say some variation of this last night, I might actually benefit from Trump‚Äôs tax cuts.
Gormless punditizing that ‚ÄúTrump‚Äôs strategy worked,‚Äù while ignoring the pushback from people of color and other progressive coalitions just gives him more reasons to keep terrorizing vulnerable communities. It also wasn‚Äôt a ‚Äústrategy,‚Äù it was ‚Äúracism.‚Äù
As the country burns, talking heads on cable news will wring their hands over the coals and wonder if now is the time that Trump will reach across the aisle.

@CharlesPPierce Yes! I wish we wouldn‚Äôt play along with the insistence that this election is just about Trump.
I feel like people are not making a big enough deal about Florida restoring voting rights to formerly incarcerated people. There are about 1.5M people (20% of FL‚Äôs Af-Am adult population)who stand to benefit from this. In 2016, Trump won Florida by just over 100,000 votes.
