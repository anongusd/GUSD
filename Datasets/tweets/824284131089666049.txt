Out on our own since ages 15 &amp; 17...both of us HS dropouts with our GED (mine‚Äôs with Honors ü§£)...married and first child at 17 &amp; 19...2nd by 19 &amp; 21...2 short term separations...1 arrest...1 psychiatric hospitalization...3 states...now in our early 40s...and here we still are.
But we didn‚Äôt get to this place easily. 3 bankruptcies, 1 foreclosure, 2 x on food stamps, I don‚Äôt know how many cars repo‚Äôd, 1 time our tires were repo‚Äôd off our car while visiting my mother out of state, pawning our wedding rings to keep the lights on while WORKING FULL TIME.
We were finally able to buy our home after renting for almost 20 years following a foreclosure early on. We only improved our station by leaving the West Coast and moving to the Midwest. Good paying jobs galore, cheap property values. American Dream is alive &amp; well here.
Hubby &amp; I carry 100K in student debt. I have my Associates Degree, he has welding certifications. That‚Äôs it. We‚Äôve been married 23 years. We have 5 children, ages 23, 21, 10, 8, 2. 2019 will be the 1st year we MIGHT make $100K. Never thought it possible.
Why don‚Äôt more banks/companies do this?? Why do we have to go into debt to get an education unless we‚Äôre born into wealth?? The alternative is working yourself sick while attending school...especially impossible if you‚Äôre also trying to raise a family. https://t.co/Vi9BRKGrZS
