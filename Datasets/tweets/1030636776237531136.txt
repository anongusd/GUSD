@Pakgkap @marchmadness @Vol_Hoops Its crazy they get overlooked. Just like that player at Murray State. They have him going #3 in draft and nobody even recruited him hardly.
@Pakgkap @marchmadness @Vol_Hoops I was getting ready to say I bet UK an UT will make it to the Final Four. I thought for sure UT was going to beat UK in the 1st matchup too.
@Pakgkap @marchmadness @Vol_Hoops He is really really good. He had over 24 points today and dude gets up. His jumpers he is straight up and down no leaning. I think he will be a top 10 pick. I wish UK had him.
@Pakgkap @marchmadness @Vol_Hoops Don't have to be seniors to be drafted. Your point guard is one of the best if not the best in the country.
@Pakgkap @marchmadness @Vol_Hoops But let's finish this season 1st. Remember in 3 weeks we should meet again then we will see if UK is legit or if they just had a horrible game.

@Felixthevol @KentuckyMBB UK WILL win the next matchup because UK is ALWAYS ready to play in Tournament ALWAYS. They are the team who has the revenge factor now.
@Felixthevol @KentuckyMBB Who's blaming the refs?
@laurnie234 @marchmadness @Vol_Hoops Your pg draft, Schofield, williams, and a few others I'm sure will test the water. 3 gone for sure though.

@PBPNYC @marchmadness @Vol_Hoops Well when you have an inside player who can move ppl around you don't have to always shoot jump shots. Look at Duke. They lost Zion and lost their next 2 games. Even Barnes stated UK not having Travis was a bug factor.
@GoDawgs999 @UofKFAN2 @aaront4ut @marchmadness @Vol_Hoops @Vol_Sports UT lost to LSU WITHOUT LSU's  point guard Tremont waters. UK lost to LSU with a last sec tip and WITH their entire team. UK WILL beat UT in Tourn. #Fact. Pin this tweet.

@marchmadness @Vol_Hoops Crowd yelling Over rated while Calipari has his crowd shut up and NOT yell it. @RickBarnesUT. UK is NOT overrated and they will prove it against your team in the SEC tourney with their ENTIRE team.
@marchmadness @Vol_Hoops Curious to see how good UT is when they lose all those Seniors next season. Cats beat UT WITH Travis by 17 lose to UT by 18 w/o him. Schofield should NOT have pissed off UK on that last play. Revenge in Tournament favors UK now. #Classless.
Thank God UK lost. Now they will be the 2 seed in the NCAA Tournament meaning the 1st two rounds they will play in Louisville 60 miles from Lexington so us fans can Watch them get to the sweet 16.  #UKvsTENN Remember UK didn't have Travis while UT had their entire team. Diff üéÆ
#UKvsTENN I think Kentucky threw the game because they will be the #2 seed in the NCAA Tournament which puts the 2 seed in Louisville at the KFC YUM center for the 1st two rounds meaning UK will be 60 miles from Lexington so their fans will show up. UK still wins the SEC tourn.

@Ponygal923 @asten77 @cuffsbyrector @tspoon28117 @PenlandKW @cnvii77 @pattigoke @tedlieu @glenns_music @realDonaldTrump @AOC @mike_pence It takes a majority to impeach. They won't have the majority. GOP controls senate and in the 2020 election will retake the house after the way Democrats have been floating around #Infanticide and 100 Trillion for their #GreenNewDeal crap.
@GOP if there is another Democratic President you better investigate EVERY INCH OF THEIR FUCKING LIFE. If Not you WILL be Replaced.
@Ponygal923 @asten77 @cuffsbyrector @tspoon28117 @PenlandKW @cnvii77 @pattigoke @tedlieu @glenns_music @realDonaldTrump @AOC @mike_pence Gop won't let impeachment happen they know they will lose their jobs.
@Ponygal923 @asten77 @cuffsbyrector @tspoon28117 @PenlandKW @cnvii77 @pattigoke @tedlieu @glenns_music @realDonaldTrump @AOC He's good. Democrats are trying too hard. Like I said if a Democrat is elected President and they don't investigate them like they are doing TRUMP because they don't like the election results then America will have bigger problems.
@Ponygal923 @asten77 @cuffsbyrector @tspoon28117 @PenlandKW @cnvii77 @pattigoke @tedlieu @glenns_music @realDonaldTrump @AOC Think they will impeach @mike_pence too? That wouldn't be to suspicious. I only hope if there's another Democratic President they investigate them as much as they are 45 for everything too.

@sevensatans @marleyxnola I am going to notify the school of the things that have been going on such as death threats against my daughter and her being taunted about fighting!
@sevensatans @marleyxnola Nobody said she did. My daughter however I know is not innocent either but I think us parents need to sit down with the counselor and talk about some issues because it's obvious to me there are problems between a few people and my daughter. I will be going regardless.

@marleyxnola So she hits a nerve and because it's on HER Page that you like to troll since you have no life you like to quote what she writes? Got it. That's kind of like stalking. Now you reply so your 5 friends in Twitter who have been liking your comments can give you 5 more likes.
@marleyxnola Well if you don't like what my daughter posts on HER FB page, and it strikes a nerve, and you need a safe place and a puppy, then why not leave HER page and scroll on instead of quoting her post on Twitter where she can't see YOU tweeting it behind her back?
@marleyxnola That's just it. There is NO joke about Murder. If someone posts that on social media then it would seem to me they are pretty upset with that person. Before it gets to something like that wouldn't you tell someone? I just found out about it and its been what 3 days?

@marleyxnola Well if she's such a good role model how about her and I have a little talk? I'd like her to know how the people you associate with are thinking of things like murdering my daughter.
Must NOT know of a Former President named Obama. Kids in cages in photos from 2014 when OBAMA was President NOT Trump.

@JulianCastro Obama had the same policy or did you forget the photos of the children seperate from their parents laying in cages under blankets. There is a photo of this from 2014 when OBAMA NOT TRUMP was President. Quit twisting Obama's failures around on Trump for enforcing what Obama did.

@InformedVoter5 @victorpage2 @David34271557 @20Schmidty @BreitbartNews Russia didn't change people's minds or votes. The FBI and all other intelligent agency's confirmed NO VOTES WERE CHANGED ON THE MACHINES. People have a right to think for themselves. You're mad because Assad sent TRUE EMAILS about Hillary's bullshit to the public.
@InformedVoter5 @victorpage2 @David34271557 @20Schmidty @BreitbartNews How about Hillary and Podesta? Podesta who's brother owns a bank in RUSSIA helped finance Hillary's campaign and they also had colluded with the Ukrainian embassy. Isn't that COLLUSION or it's only because Trump won so just investigate him because your side lost FAIR ABD SQUARE.
@InformedVoter5 @victorpage2 @David34271557 @20Schmidty @BreitbartNews Ok. Well you want collusion here you go. Mueller was with Hillary, Obama, Comey, and Holder when they sold our Uranium to Russia. Since Mueller was there isn't that conflict of interest it's Russia and he's investigating collusion with Russia? I have more.
@amyschumer @TwitterSupport why is her account not blocked? You blocked mine for using the word white but her calling people fags is ok?

@boomer6948 @Nostromo147 @EricaRN4USA Of course she does because she's for that until someone does it to her. Kind of like they say we love all Illegals until one takes out a family member of theirs but then they will say it's the guns fault because it pulled the trigger by itself. Their logic in a nutshell.
@LuluBowen1 @HillaryClinton @IvankaTrump I know that's why I'm saying nothing will happen. Just more wasted taxpayers money. Lock them up for breaking the law.

@FUDmuffin @MelGlina @Top_Sergeant @realDonaldTrump How can it be made fair then when one state has a million more people than 3 states combined?
@kristinc524 @MelGlina @Top_Sergeant @realDonaldTrump Why wouldn't I be saying the same thing? The system is the one we've had in place since the founding fathers put it there so we follow it. Obama won in 08 and 12 so what's your point?
@no1mate @1virtualgenie @GOPChairwoman @SenKamalaHarris I agree completely with that. From Trump all the way down. Show us their E-mails and their voting record. I bet we would fire all their asses come voting time.
@MelGlina @Top_Sergeant @realDonaldTrump Do you know why we have the electoral college? Quick lesson. It's to prevent one state like California whose population is bigger than 4-5 states doesn't pick the President every 4 years.
@mlprz30 @Top_Sergeant @realDonaldTrump That comment explains why we have the electoral college. So one state with the larger population than 3-4 states combined don't pick our President every election.

@Aye_WussupEarly @mixedco54 @johnrich @Nike Yeah he sucked. If he was any good at QB he'd still be in like Aaron Rodgers, Tom Brady, Nick Foles, hell even Teddy Bridgewater who tore his ACL at Minnesota still has a job.
@mixedco54 @johnrich @Nike @GOP You didn't see ANY corruption from the Democrat party over 8 years of Obama. Fast&amp;Furious, Uranium one deal, Giving 1.7 billion to a country Chanting death to America ect ect.... Benghazi which a soldier who was THERE fighting also says Obama and Hillary screwed them.

@mixedco54 @johnrich @Nike I don't assume anything. You can read this how you want. Politics have NO place in sports. People PAY money they EARN to watch it and get away from it. He didn't risk anything. He's a MILLIONAIRE. He sucked and he got mad cause nobody wanted him. Normal people can see thru it.

@EbonyApplePy @RickyDidThat @AndyStumpf77 @Kaepernick7 @Nike Don't know. I think Iraq was Bullshit. We took care of them in Desert Storm no reason to go back but he did cause his dad in the 90s. Stupid war. That's like when They killed Qhadaffi. Why? Now Syria is a mess. Qhadaffi finally was against Terrorism but Hillary had him killed.

@danita68085746 @FoxNews You look angry
Wow. Every person who has ever used the word THUG when talking about the ONLY THING they are describing such as a CRIMINAL is NOW RACIST according to this MORON. https://t.co/OicBsQUES5
@TripleS_kid @mixedco54 @johnrich @Nike You're a dumbass.
@TripleS_kid @mixedco54 @johnrich @Nike I work where it's 90pct black and 10pct white. For some reason I guess when all of my Black friends call people Thugs who commit crimes I guess they are all RACIST for using that term
@TripleS_kid @mixedco54 @johnrich @Nike Really? Come to Downtown Louisville when people are shooting people or look at Chicago EVERYDAY. You love the police when you NEED them for home invasions and rescues but when they kill a THUG who murders another person then you categorize them ALL as bad and bad THUG walks.
