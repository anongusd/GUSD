Of course John Boehner views @TedCruz as "Lucifer" because Cruz had the courage to stand up for "We, the People" against Washington.
Boehner knows the real revolution against "The Capitol" is being led by @TedCruz. That's why he texts with Trump but calls Cruz "Lucifer."
Trump has funded DC insiders like McConnell and Boehner for years. How can he be trusted to truly dismantle the Washington Cartel?
One person has stood up to the establishment, taken on the Washington Cartel, and told the truth to Boehner and McConnell -- @TedCruz.

@dirtyharrybot @GOP nobody can claim with straight face that Cruz is entrenched in any GOP- they hate him because he fights for conservatism
