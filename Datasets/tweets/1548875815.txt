@JackPosobiec There's lots of companies laying off people the right-wing lying press refuses to cover. It's called the "Trump economy".
@MorpheusPharma @charliekirk11 It's $3 billion free cash, 5 billion military hardware, 5 billion in loan guarantees &amp; 3 billion to Egypt &amp; Saudi Arabia to not attack Israel when she massacres occupation and apartheid protestors. That's $16 billion EACH year to Israel...the 16th richest nation per-capita. SCAM

@DianaStTropez @sagevalenti1 @patrick_kathy @WarlickLeslie @RadioFreeTom 1927 Berlin, Goebbels ran Nazi newspaper, Angriff and attacked Jewish chief-of-police. Nick-named him "Isidore" as insult.

@DianaStTropez @sagevalenti1 @patrick_kathy @WarlickLeslie @RadioFreeTom All the political rhetoric you see today in USA happened to Germany between 1920 and 1933. Left-wing press vs right-wing press battles are all on display, for example in Berlin when Goebbels ran the Nazi paper, "Angriff". Right-wing "arguments" were fear of immigrants &amp; socialism
@DianaStTropez @sagevalenti1 @patrick_kathy @WarlickLeslie @RadioFreeTom I read "Rise And Fall of the Third Reich" thirty years ago at age 14.

FEAR is easiest tactic to get people to do ANYTHING you want.
@RadioFreeTom When "conservatives" got into bed with neo-Confederates and religious zealots two-decades ago to win elections, you couldn't extrapolate what would happen? It was plain as day and I've been screaming it since 1994 when the GOP was hijacked by creeps Newt, Lott, Delay and Armey

@ABUAJ_US @Tonycuz @JVER1 Yet, you support an out and out bigot like Trump who prefers his immigrants from Norway and puts Steve Bannon...an avowed anti-Semite in his freakin cabinet. The hypocrisy never ends with Trumpers. SMFH
@TweetingYarnie @thehill Let me guess who created this meme. Another TRUMPER pretending to be a "Democrat". Why not just admit you voted Trump over Hillary? You fool no one.
RT @seanmickeyG14: How to sack a quarterback in the NFL....wait nvm. https://t.co/EYuOo4qNEq
@SueSmith587 @thehill 80% of both genders have not read a book since high school. So, it's pretty much only 20% of society that understands / desires intelligence to begin with. I couldn't date a bimbo no matter her looks.
@porterguy1969 @Tonycuz @sherrilee7 @renato_mariotti So much for your "theory". 		"Level of interest in midterms is 73% among seniors &amp; 35% among young  voters, per NBC/WSJ poll. Imagine U.S. politics if gap was different. And in line with past midterms voting rates among voters by age" (https://t.co/EXPnspKEUU …):"
@porterguy1969 @Tonycuz @sherrilee7 @renato_mariotti Um....no. You simply don't have the facts on your side. There's nothing low average about these numbers compared to today. And he never said Kavanaugh had anything to do with the huge drop. It's simply a fact, regardless how you want to spin it. https://t.co/Zyn6ixOHlO
@porterguy1969 @Tonycuz @sherrilee7 @renato_mariotti Or...you can explain to people, what I just told you. We've seen this play before...in fact...it's exactly how Trump got elected. Instead of triangulating and stealing their issues, just before an election, the left decided to makes demands over bathrooms. Good luck with that
@Tonycuz @porterguy1969 @sherrilee7 @renato_mariotti Absolutely...let the GOP own this guy!!! He will be the gift that keeps on giving ELECTION AFTER ELECTION. The end of the GOP majority as we know could be at an end. Remember, if Dems win Congress AND the White House...it's two against one SCOTUS.
@porterguy1969 @Tonycuz @sherrilee7 @renato_mariotti DUH!!! Not before a mid-term election that will motivate every right-wing nut to come out and vote. I'm sorry, but our coalition and YOU are devoid of any strategy whatsoever.
@porterguy1969 @sherrilee7 @Tonycuz @renato_mariotti As he said...the "utter naivete" of the left. And you just proved it. As a female, your virtue-signaling does not impress me. Like most on the far-left, you really don't understand politics at all. No wonder they don't exist in any branch of government.
@sherrilee7 @porterguy1969 @Tonycuz @renato_mariotti White men and white women installed Trump. And FIFTY-MILLION women who stayed home because they didn't give a flying fuck about their sisters. It's time to stop coddling the irresponsible. Men aren't under attack, women are. A Kavanaugh seat may be just what they need to wake up
@analyticascent @Tonycuz @Jojotweets3 @TheAtlantic @amandaripley The subject "changed" when YOU brought up statistical-modeling that had zero to do with the historical ACTIONS of ONE party...the GOP. The economy may or may not have been in a boom or bust cycle. Regardless, THEIR actions DEEPENED or outright CAUSED the worst downturns.

@Diana24724 @Tonycuz @evryone_XR @TheMig29 @GrayGoes @yzest5121 @FreeStateYank No. You're fooling yourself.

@Diana24724 @Tonycuz @evryone_XR @TheMig29 @GrayGoes @yzest5121 @FreeStateYank 10 years ago the social-capitalist nations were deemed to have the highest standard of living in the world and still do.

@RealJamesWoods It was Ronald Reagan that gave amnesty to THREE MILLION illegals to get their votes. It was a Republican Congress since 1994 that allowed in another ELEVEN MILLION to get their votes. You need to study more.

@ToddGaterTables @MsRed_Mel @vintageport014 @dorbar Then you must hate Trump with very fiber of your body...since Trump is a pussy-grabbing, draft-dodging, wage-thief who shits on the Constitution...right?
@RealJamesWoods Why am I not surprised that you spread Fox propaganda, the least trusted Republican media outlet in America.

@rianalynn @RealJamesWoods @JacobAWohl Actually a CONSERVATIVE thing. Have U seen Kansas, the "conservative" showcase of trickledown? The GOP has run Congress and our MONEY since 1994 (23 yrs) . Dems had 4 years since 94 w/ only 5 months of filibuster-proof Congress. There's ONE party to blame for every problem in USA
@MsRed_Mel @vintageport014 @dorbar No matter how disgusting a conservative Republican acts...suddenly, he's never a "real" conservative every time you call these hypocrites out
@larryelder So beneath you
@larryelder From a marketing standpoint, you'd become a powerhouse with excellent points from the right AND the left. Abandon trickle-down and you'd be immensely popular with a huge and unique swath of the political spectrum. Your own true brand https://t.co/LQ7XGt6ESm
@larryelder Your debates on "leftist race-baiting" are excellent. Imagine how popular you'd be if you abandoned tribalism that makes you defend the GOP &amp; their horrible economic record. GOP voters are waking up to this and why they voted Trump. But Trump will never go against his own class https://t.co/QlrszYsNBg

@TomHillgardner @RichardInBoston Wrong. Clinton &amp; Obama ran as DEMOCRATS, never as a "socialist". Yet, Bill ran as centrist in 92 &amp; pushed a social-dem HillaryCare in 93
