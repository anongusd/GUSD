@dr_valentino Americans can have a merit based immigration policy and that's not racist, it's political and economical. This is why people hate Hispanic people, you're all so twisted.
@VaguelyFunnyDan @realDonaldTrump You don't understand that building a wall and changing immigration is not racist, it's political. This is why people hate hispanics, they're so twisted.
@Gus_802 You don't care about the narcissistic abuse hispanics committed against me as an attractive white woman. If you want to help Hispanic people you should kill a Hispanic narcassist.
@leolarav @nowthisnews Haha you said stop being racist and let you say "negro". See, Hispanic people lack critical thinking skills. You all should stop embarrassing yourselves and just stop talking.
@rocinonte @TheLastWord Any race can hate hispanics because hispanics are narcissists.
