@metlman I mentioned that. You clearly did not read the entire thread.
It appears that any opinion short of "I know for a fact that Ford is a liar and also a bitch" is too "liberal" for some of you. I always regret visiting this website.
If you can find a place where I said this, I'll shave my head https://t.co/YaNRDZ8f6I
Nothing like calling me "sweety" (misspelled) in a condescending manner while also thinking the correct word here is "couching" https://t.co/4MO3Hq6hSb
I said at the start of my thread, &amp; repeatedly throughout, that I do not know which story to believe. Everything I said was a fact, not speculation rooted in partisanship with partisan aims. I'm sorry that you seem unable to grasp that someone might have a nuanced opinion. https://t.co/UyXM6qUxy3
I'm just reminding everyone that someone saying "I knew him; he never assaulted me!" or "I knew him; he always treated me with respect!" is never definitive proof that that person always treated everyone else the same way.
... Again, I'm not claiming to know what happened either way, because I don't. Actually, I think that most of the people who *are* confidently claiming to know one way or the other have those opinions based on partisanship rather than on the facts ...
... the fact that his own friends would insist he's incapable of doing something like this doesn't mean it's impossible that he did do it. It just means he has friends, like literally all humans do, even the really shitty ones ...
... I understand that the Kavanaugh case is a bit different than the ones I just mentioned because we have just one accuser &amp; not many -- &amp; I understand that these sorts of men generally do exhibit this kind of behavior as a pattern rather than as a single incident -- but ...
... Every man who has turned out to be guilty of sexual harassment/assault/rape -- like Weinstein, Cosby &amp; Moore -- didn't harass/assault/rape everyone. They all had people in their lives who could make similar statements about them being "good dudes." ...
I don't know if Kavanaugh did what he's accused of doing or not. What I do know is that these statements from people who know him saying that's it's impossible that he did do it because he's such a good dude are completely irrelevant to the conversation ...

Nice https://t.co/e7PrzsOfTT
I said this exact thing in my next tweet. Are you that dumb to not read the entire thread? https://t.co/rUxDJvt3UW
The only difference is that @michelleisawolf is a comedian, not the leader of the free world, and therefore deserves more leeway.
I completely agree with this. https://t.co/CIDWlS3FOU
So when Trump makes fun of Mika's face the Right says chill it's just a joke &amp; the Left says it's an outrage. When Michelle Wolf makes fun of SHS's eyeshadow the Left says chill it's just a joke &amp; the Right says it's an outrage. Got it. You all make zero sense.

What's fiscally responsible about passing a bill that costs $1.3 TRILLION of our hard-earned money without even bothering to read it? https://t.co/h2Yaa1nvs8
True, but many Republicans in Congress have campaigned on being fiscally responsible only to turn around and vote for this bill without reading it https://t.co/8i2wr2txk9
If you voted Republican because you care about fiscal responsibility &amp; your own hard-earned tax dollars being spent responsibly &amp; you don't now feel like a fool --  you are one.
