@HManyora Prof, the Kenyan parent is not keen on being involved in the development of their children, so they rather delegate the responsibility to teachers and the boarding platform serves them well. Which middle class would want to interact with the children 365 days a year?

@SophiaWanuna That was passion and professionalism as well.  Good work ensuring we re informed amidst the harassment at JKIA
@AdvBarryRoux @Koffide_Media The only time when this is acceptable is when you are going to throw her away in a deep ocean or a bottomless pit!
@Shallie_ ....Lost the meaning of exquisite when I saw that "stand," the price is fair though, considering it is inclusive of VAT!😂
@Isaackcheboiwo hahahaahahaaaaa..., my ribs
@gilnasiali @KBonimtetezi Please, when you get the analogy, call me and explain to me..., I do not understand it either
I think this is a worthy debate that we ought to engage https://t.co/37qqEqto3W
You forgot to mention politicians too like the loquacious Nyeri town Mp, Njunjiri Wambugu and Raila sycophants like Homa Bay governor Cyprian Awiti. https://t.co/vnPcG3jq9M
@evankirstel @RichSimmondsZA @evansdianga
@WaihigaMwaura, you may want to talk to these three young fellows @KenaravaGroup  concerning agribiz, interesting insights on agribiz from young people
Most dangerous people today are the bloggers...Now that we used to attack Raila/Uhuru and they have finally become friends ...., who do we attack? Kenyans beware, bloggers can make you trend today if you are seen with a yellow trouser

@Ngaruthi @RailaOdinga hahahahaaaa, there is never a dull day in twitter....you will go to work at night if you are a Jubilite and daytime if you are a Nasarite
@FerdyOmondi Brother @FerdyOmondi , be careful, Ekuru Aukot's penchant for lawsuits may land you in courtrooms....the opposition leader is Aukot. Today's meeting was between the two Kenyan presidents!
We are so used to political conmanship and trickery in Kenya that when politicians decide to do sth that appears good we get confused. Ok  Kenyans, what is happening..., anybody, anyone...?
@KenMijungu @RailaOdinga "dissence"
@EAukot 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
@jjogola @EAukot @KTNNews @UKenyatta @RailaOdinga hahahahahaaaaaa...................if my ribs break, please take me not to KNH, lest they open my kidney
@Wakabando @PresidentKE @UKenyatta @CoalitionNASAKe @RailaOdinga @citizentvkenya @ntvkenya @KTNNews @TheStarKenya @K24Tv Must give it to moderate politicians like @Wakabando who know politics is not a matter of life and death! You can imagine how hardliners are feeling when these two gentlemen men sit on a table

@MuchaiKagu @KTNNews unfortunately..., this one is a literate one.., i donno how to explain this
@MarthaKarua Good luck mheshimiwa. I was thinking that you would apply for the DPP post you jail some of the well known looters and the perpetrators of the 07 PEV
@JKNjenga You forgot to mention "the Kenya Police"
Ooops, thank you Arsenal and Wenger, you have distracted the loquacious counsel from trading his guns on the Kenyan judiciary momentarily. Another beneficiary of this distraction is Raila Odinga, the Kenyan opposition leader! https://t.co/NkoOJRCcXx

@Kipkirui_Kev @ElvoKibet The simplistic manner in which people calculate agricultural investment is appalling
@mqhlay @WanjeriNderu You forgot about the Kidero grass that refused to grow....it was him
@KenMijungu @Isaackcheboiwo Instead of buying him uniforms, how about a golf stick in preparation for the directions from our beloved president that we roll out golfs in the primary schools..., don't you think that is more helpful?
@OchiengOdongoKE Exactly Max, so even if the question of faith seems too surreal for a rational person, I still want to believe in God based on what Pascal says.....over to you!
@OchiengOdongoKE Interesting! What a coincidence, I was reading something about Pascal's wager just now now.  Hebu google it out (Pascal's wager) an interesting read
@governorkibwana @ItsMutai Bwana governor am an admirer of your work  but when such issues are raised, you should take advantage and correct them. Rome wasn't built in a day, just find a way of addressing such concerns instead of whining about the messenger
@WehliyeMohamed Ask him if he still thinks that the Judiciary is a den of Wakora as he claimed after losing the Embu battle to prof Ojienda

@ItsMutai @Max_Kenyatta @Asamoh_ people should value family......donge? reminds me of the 7m bribe..., or was it 200,000 bribe?

@ahmednasirlaw @JBoinnet @JZarif @makaumutua @WMutunga @RTNSomalitv am shocked you did two tweets here without mentioning @RailaOdinga . Anyway bwana Ahmednassir, you are a dyed-in-the wool supporter of the regime, you can just text Uhuru to order Boinnet to release those guys
That Kenyans are silent when a class 7 dropout has been nominated a cabinet minister is more worrying!!

@DavidNdii  please help us understand (if it is true that is) why petrol prices in Uganda (who imports through Kenya) and TZ are lower than Kenya
@ahmednasirlaw @MagiWambui @WaNduta8 Oops, so a man with supposed "double digit IQ, reads all the tweets by "mentally challenged Kenyans" with single digit IQ." LOLEST!
@fokango @EAukot @citizentvkenya @KoinangeJeff Forgive me my brother, is he the "official leader of the opposition" or the "leader of the official opposition?"

@scheafferoo 1. Cracking the whip on the Dothrakis 	2. Vetting Cersei Lannister and other stories	3. The withdrawn passports
@KTNNews OOoops, I forget so quickly, can someone tell me what it means by being an "advocate of the high court" and confirm if this loquacious politician is one of them. Please, I must have forgotten
Countrymen, had Miguna Miguna won the Nairobi gubernatorial seat, we would have had the first Canadian to be the next Nairobi governor, duly cleared by EACC, IEBC and DCI to run for an office in Kenya! We take a break and the Kenyan dramedy continues..., aha! https://t.co/2YnnUSW1em

@DonaldBKipkorir @ahmednasirlaw Wakili Don, our beloved SC wears two hats, one as a counsel and the other as a Jubilee diehard. Therefore, when engaging him, you need to ask him which hat he wears at that time
@Boncrazy1 The problem with small minds...! If they can arrest Miguna Miguna and TJ Kajwang who are prominent people, what would they do to you, an insignificant citizen whether Jubilee or NASA supporter?
@ahmednasirlaw @StandardKenya Even my one-year-old daughter knows that political alliances are about interests. A whole senior counsel postulating that love (of all the things) bind politicians! You are the reason 8-4-4 ought to be scrapped master benchfixer!
The comments though... https://t.co/Ri5rszJKdY
@EAukot I lost the meaning of "incitement" when I read your comments daktari...please educate me good people
@So_shedy @zumuni @DavidNdii How come they did not throw stones during the "swearing in?"
@So_shedy @IamNjokiKelvin @DavidNdii Have you seen any of Uhuru Kenyatta's relatives pick a gun to go and fight in Somalia like our KDF soldiers do?
@DonaldBKipkorir @ahmednasirlaw @WehliyeMohamed Have you considered walking? There is no better way to have a dedicated lane than to walk or run?

@Nyasirwa @Asamoh_ @EAukot @DoItBetty Wait a minute? he had a political career? as an elected MCA, MP or what? you guys keep confusing me, ama we are not talking of the same individual yawa...
@Donsarigo also remember...you have to go to town in a group..."never walk alone!"
Two quick things from Uhuru park: Kenyan opposition is not necessarily violent and the government is not entirely intolerant. Why can't they just sit and chart the way forward for a prosperous Kenya then?
@Wakabando For the first time, the government made a smart move, it would have been a bloody confrontation
@Isaackcheboiwo @Machukah Aiii, hebu tingiza kichwa you confirm kama akili bado iko..., labda ilianguka!
But whoever advised the government not to interfere with the "swearing in" was brilliant...No bloodshed, no confrontation and  everyone goes home happy!
Dear Raila, if this is how secure Nrb will be upon the swearing in, please, swear yourself in every week. You are also welcome to swear yourself in in Lamu where Al-Shabaab is finishing us! https://t.co/l1ibzSXFG8

@EAukot Daktari what is your take on the people's assembly? when you talk about bunge la wananchi, is it not the same platform that NASA wants to use?

@HonAdenDuale Hehehe, Just remembered how you shouted when Uhuruto was almost being barred fro elections
@RonohKechem I thought secondary school was to be free from January 2018?
@kenyan_supergal @Rnagila @StandardKenya Two weeks ago, I was almost lynched on a Saturday morning at Tearoom by Matatu crews after I demanded to be paid for my indicator crushed when a Nyeri Sacco matatu was reversing. It turned tribal when they realised am a Luo and I had to speed off. This cannot be tolerated anymore
That time of the year when suddenly, all the politicians and the rich realize that there are Kenyans who are "less fortunate" and thus deserve a donation/sharing. Happy festivities everyone

@DavidNdii Hahahahaaa,  the gentleman has got his short moment of fame!
@ahmednasirlaw @gathara @AMB_A_Mohammed @AmbMKamau But who can be better placed to ask this question other than the dyed-in-the wool Jubilee apologist/blogger @ahmednasirlaw ?

@SmritiVidyarthi @KenMijungu @MikeSonko Is there any difference between how they behave and how their boss - Mike Sonko behaves?
For some strange reasons, we have "relegated" education reforms to prompt marking of exams and strict supervision of exams. Treating symptoms and ignoring the ailment

@NdianyOkello @C_NyaKundiH , If Moses Kuria is also under your boychild protection program, then am afraid I resist your presidency of the boychild. Can you disown him publicly so that we feel safe under you, donge?
@Ang_angie6 It is unfair yea, but the law awards damages based on the "stature" of personality. If Calvin Omondi (Me) was defamed by Moses Kuria just like he did to Martha, I would be given less because who knows me anyway to be defamed
@Asamoh_ If you make the wallet a constant, these problems will be sorted. She will be serious from one January to the next January
@ahmednasirlaw @HonAdenDuale @kipmurkomen Well, instead of drafting the debate for debate in the house, just take it directly to the president for his assent. This could be a good reward for the many songs you sang for the regime
wow! https://t.co/gQaWma9ARI
@kipmurkomen Worry less senator, you have a very loong tongue..., keep talking
@tezira Hahahahaaa, last time I checked, you were not "tribal" and you could not comment on issues of tribe....
@bonifacemwangi @wmnjoya Daktari, are you challenging @ahmednasirlaw ? He is one of the dyed-in-wool apologists of the regime. Perhaps the good lawyer could take up this challenge
@BenjiNdolo Do you honestly think that Kenyans have time for such foolishness Benji. Eti sisi tumekaa tu kwa radio tunaskiza wewe na Asamoa argue over who is brighter than the other. Enyewe you pple think Kenyans are fools

@OwuorMichael Digging two holes to fill one hole
If Ida Odinga had prayed at Sachangwan, then a few days later, several people perish, you can guess what would be trending for the last three days. Cambridge Analotyca has destroyed our nation
@WanjeriNderu @BenjiNdolo @reginanyabs The two of them match each other. Since I saw Benji's tweet on kutahiri and the manner in which he was responding (in the same manner) to those attacks, I think they match each other. It is poetic justice at its best
@scheafferoo If you risk engaging in this futile and infantile conversation am reading around about toxic whatever..., "sawecheni."
@EAukot Son of  a Nomad, it has been long since you trended on Twitter, please say something about Raila to get some publicity brother, we are worried of slow fade my brother. Or perhaps look for something to take to court this week, donge?
@Asamoh_ @BenjiNdolo Brother @Asamoh_ , as the umpire, am calling for a timeout to give Uncle Benji time to catch some breath. Am also ordering uncle Benji to remove the studs (or earings) from his ears as they are not allowed in the precincts of the boxing ring.
@EtalePhilip @ngunjiriwambugu I overheard ladies arguing that short men have esteem issues..., I don't know if it is true but I will confirm next year

@timothynjoya .........anyone who has understood what the first part of this statement means to help me. At least I have understood the second part......
@SaddiqueShaban Can you confirm if that man who used to take water for the elephants in Amboseli and the journalist who carried the crippled man when bees attacked them during the Supreme court judgement got awards too?
@BenjiNdolo @Asamoh_ Hehehe, lakini Benji, I have always had high regards for you but seeing all these engagements you have on twitter makes me think otherwise of who you are. C

@okothkenneth @wmnjoya Mheshimiwa, I do not think the problem is with the structure but rather the content of the curriculum
@kenyanpundit TANO TENA
@ntvkenya Ooops, the good professor is deflating his "professorship" again. You see, there are good reasons I think education is overrated!
@BenjiNdolo The Northern corridor has been ignored by the government since independence, Coast has been largely ignored by the govt. Ukambani is lagging behind as well. Is Raila the reason for this inequality as well?
@TheStarKenya Hehehee, nice humour
@Watimz @Rnagila How can they make up what they lack..., "the mind."
@Kiss100kenya Letter "e"
@wmnjoya This is the new philosophy, but why does he talk about presidential elections yet he was not vying himself?
@KTNNews @ashleymazuri @wmnjoya Apparently, but my concern is why he is even  commenting on an election where he did not vie as well. I have never seen a warped logic (or lack of it)
@KTNNews @ashleymazuri Dr. @wmnjoya , if you did not sit for KCPE or KCSE this year, please, you have no basis commenting on exams and curriculum. Quintessential case of jukebox professorship!
@TomBwana Oops, seems like  the number of Twitter followers is the new measure of significance....

@DonaldBKipkorir Don't I just like the adjectives lawyers use to describe opinions. "Lazy..., incoherrent.." Martha Karua's petition against Waiguru was described as "Hopeless."

@timothynjoya Good reverend, is your keyboard okay?  A good number of your tweets are full of typos. Kindly correct so that we do not miss a thing you post. God bless you
@KiruthuLucy @BenjiNdolo Soon you will find out that mama Ngina is the Aunt to Ida Odinga's first cousin and Uhuru Kenyatta and Joho married from the same family
@Asamoh_ @BenjiNdolo @UKenyatta I would not waste time on @BenjiNdolo if I were you, you are giving too much publicity to him
@WehliyeMohamed We also ask why you did not tag your lawyer friend @ahmednasirlaw in this tag considering that he is the biggest defender of those carrying gunny sacks
@kipmurkomen We are also praying that the Lord may uproot your loud mouth from the high ground you have placed it so that you become a little quiet
With the garbage problem in Nrb, it is hard to know whether it is Sonko Rescue team or Nairobi county cleaning team that has absconded work. Whom do we hold responsible bwana sonko?
@BenjiNdolo though....
@ntvkenya Could the NASA you are talking about be the same that was formed a year ago in Kenya? Woe unto those who took 6 years to understand what came into existence 1 year ago!
Please tell me you're kidding me, please, please, tell me it is a joke!! https://t.co/lcBlcCp7Z0
And now suddenly, every Kenyan is against the brutality and slavery in Libya, yet very few talk of the slaughtered kids and the perceived extermination of NASA supporters by the police
@UKenyatta Start by your country because we are fast approaching them....

Haven't seen the former Mombasa senator, a fervent human rights activist condemn the shooting of the children in these post-election issues. Good sen, we still look at you as a firm defender of the helpless!
@BettyMKyallo But Betty, doesn't it make you hypocritical to talk of atrocities in Libya which you read about in the media yet here at home, you do not talk about the shooting of a 7 year old, baby Pendo and Moraa. Charity begins at home sista
Oooops, and the equality gospel is taking over the world https://t.co/nEPtUXzcgs
OOoops! The innocence in her statement speaks volumes of the state of the nation https://t.co/DnTUSKTMFq
@Shividza @HassanOmarH forgive me, he is the senator for which county? Looks like nimesahau tena!
@didiation @BettyMKyallo Betty, unlike this lady who likes you for your physical looks, we appreciate you for bringing us news in our screens. Let us  appreciate our women not for their body looks, but for the things that matter
@ntvkenya Is there an NTV app that can inform me through my phone when the ritual at Kasarani ends so that I can cut short this golf game, get back to the house and watch other programs? please assist me.
Dear @kipmurkomen , the Anne Amadi you wanted to be removed from judiciary just administered the oath of office to the president. Has your positioned changed? or now she is a good person?
@WehliyeMohamed The tragedy of the proletariat!
Ooops, someone stole Museveni's script of dealing with Besigye https://t.co/OuBQDNKPyF
Dear @ahmednasirlaw , am surprised you were not at Thika law courts today to defend the thieves who stole 50 million from KCB Thika branch. Or you are still engaged in defending @AnneWaiguruin NYS heist?
@scheafferoo Ooops, it is hard being a Kenyan yawa, it is, let's admit it.
@Gerabaiby Ei yawa, am tired of Kenyans yawa.
@Lucywaalex @ItsMutai @BenjiNdolo As Trump would put it "Nambia." I saw @kipmurkomen advancing this thought as well and I checked again to confirm whether am in Kenya. Am wondering what strategy  has been used to win votes in Kenya other than tribe
@botlhe88 @kamonjomaina Wa wa wa, some people are keen on details. How did you even discover this?
@Benogola wachanga ukweli kama hizo Ben, you know the truth is poisonous in Africa
@shailjapatel @gathara Oops, @gathara , I don't know how you select "candidates" for #dumbassery and #dumbfuckery but this one qualifies!
@KinyanBoy Please be careful how you quote it. It is Shs 300M "only." It is hard small yawa!
@scheafferoo Let's begin by asking whether the President loves you!
But really, replacing Mugabe with his former loyal ZANU PF VP is like replacing the loquacious @kipmurkomen with the gabby @HonAdenDuale . Zimbabwe is digging one hole to fill another hole But we wish them well with the experiment!
Hahahaaa, where is Robert Alai, Makodingo, and the other common "ogandawalla" who voted celebrating? Seychelles? https://t.co/DWz17CIo7y
@TheStarKenya @kipmurkomen @makaumutua Heheheeeee, "Legal titans."
@jamessmat Thank you James. We have reduced important national discourses into a Jubilee/Nasa dichotomy. Makes it hard to objectively question issues as one would be seen as a NASA/Jubilee apologist!
@MumbiJosphen @The_Gracey @a_opondo @Benogola I find it unfair to generalize it that Kikuyus hate Luos! There are those people who are stupid enough to hate others just because of politics and it cuts across all the communities
@EzekielMutua @sautisol But daktari has merely expressed his feelings about the video, which I fully support too. I haven't seen where the video is banned
@DonaldBKipkorir @kenyanpundit @EAukot , please give our president time to work. Advice @CyrusJirongo, and  al your MPs in the National Assembly to give my beloved president time to work!
@e_lumumba @Isaackcheboiwo God don't I just love some people. Very keen on detail. Asante bwana for that
@C_NyaKundiH I can't wait to pay rent of 10,000 for a three bedroomed house in Kileleshwa! Let it burst
@HistoryKe Enyewe, hatred is real. Just read the comments....
@timothynjoya Indeed sometimes I wonder if there is any religious eader in the current crop who can stand strong on an ideology like you did back then. I shall now revert to political discussions reverend. Thanks for the insight
"Inzi ikiacha ujinga, inawezatengeneza asali," my question is, how do welp the fly rid itself of ujinga? tunataka hii asali yake
@timothynjoya Karibu Reverend. My friends are however complaining that you have never "prophesied"  and "anoint" them to own cars and build houses like we have seen other preachers do!
@ahmednasirlaw The problem when a lawyer turns to political blogging
@BenjiNdolo @DonaldBKipkorir @PresidentKE "Occasionally stumble?"
@KenMijungu @BenjiNdolo @Gorsemelango1 "Bad hyena!"
@timothynjoya Good Reverend, take time to read through your tweet before posting, your point is lost in the typos yet we want to read them. God bless you
@ahmednasirlaw @WehliyeMohamed @DonaldBKipkorir @KoinangeJeff @Mosotah @bettymurungi Oops, but a man stalking a fellow man is as disgusting as can be!

@scheafferoo @realDanielJuma Can I work at Lee as the accountant? or there are specific jobs that NTSA wants to assign the drunk drivers?
@TomBwana Hehe, but Tom, what do you mean "with limited English?" Could he have been keeping some English to use later because Bob could not take "unlimited English?"
@DonaldBKipkorir Wakili, but @EAukot is an exceptional case in Africa.! He has no seat in parliament but he does not want to join the govt (I hope he hasn't changed his mind yet)
@EAukot I agree daktari, let us summon our parliamentary group next week and plan on our legislative agenda. We can also do this in the counties through our 103 able MCAs, our 2 governors and the 6 senators, donge? viva Thirdway alliance
@timothynjoya Hehe, good reverend, have you prayed about it?
Who saw the international space shuttle? I hear it was last seen in Githurai!!!
Please please please @FredMatiangi , bring back the holiday tuition, lift the ban on caning students and increase the teachers' pay! Imagine if we had only 2  such "mathematicians" in each county!! https://t.co/lSf2k0cYOp
@Disembe @ItsBorn Ooops, and your list of stupid people just increased again!
@timothynjoya Good Reverend, just finish your words or use full words, Twitter increased the characters to 280, or yours is 140 we launch an appeal?
@Aaroncheruiyot Common senator, be nice to the gentleman, uchumi ni mbaya na lazima wat walipe bills yawa
@Disembe @ItsBorn I find this profiling of Kikuyus distasteful the same way profiling of other tribes is. Anyway, you are entitled to your opinion.
@ahmednasirlaw ...but you are also waving to "catch" the King's eyes as well
@kipmurkomen One day I took my car for servicing and the shocker was that the supposed mechanic had no idea how to drive!
@KBonimtetezi , please confirm that you are fine omwami. We heard that they were trailing you
@DonaldBKipkorir @ahmednasirlaw @WehliyeMohamed Wakili, be careful when dealing with @ahmednasirlaw , it is hard to know when he argues as a lawyer or as a Jubilee blogger!
@EAukot Daktari, I also confess my sins as well, I underrated you in the August elections and talked badly about your candidature, but you did well in the repeat polls and emerged as the official leader of the opposition with several MPs, MCAs and one governor. Please forgive me too
@EAukot Son of a Nomad, official opposition leader, who is "the bandist" who shot the police in Kepedo?
@DavidNdii Hehe, probably his father is one of your former students daktari
@gathara @WanjeriNderu @gathara , how do people make it to #Dumbassery and #Dumbfuckery? Do I need my ID and voters card? Asking for a friend who is also asking for another friend who is not on Twitter?
@gathara @BenjiNdolo Ooops, I thought today was Sunday? the media in Kenya don't work on Sundays
While there are many courses am willing to die for, there ain't any of them that will make me take away someone else's life

@florence_mutua Junet Mohammed - Zulu	Steve Mbogo - Xhosa	Boniface Khalwale - Igbo	foolishness galore!!
@Aaroncheruiyot @Navz0017 ....and was teargas lobbied at the supporters? we expected young senators like you to be the voice of reason yet you are advancing the old tired narrative

@EAukot @MMakoloo @jnyegenye Am still recovering from your flawed thesis that if you talk about the Turkana issues than you are a tribal leader!

@MutahiNgunyi In case anyone confused, this is a professor from our good country called Kenya. Now you know

@AbdiAhm95768082 @ahmednasirlaw @WehliyeMohamed @RTNSomalitv Liar, Liar, @WehliyeMohamed comes from the Northern part of Mid Southeast Central, a place called King'eero, near Ngatuine chief's camp, opposite, Nyadhune stream, just next to Nyang'emenyeni. Unashuka tu hapo kwa Muthure stage

@Asamoh_ According to lawyer @JeniferShamalla , the army just raided an NGO!!!
@EstherPassaris Mheshimiwa you were made for this! Your passion for this work is just amazing! God bless you
@KBonimtetezi Omwami pole sana for your loss and your family. Tunawaombea Mungu awape amani wakati huu wa msiba
@DonaldBKipkorir @WehliyeMohamed @makodingo Wakili, Makdingo is from Sare Awendo? Hahahahaaaaaa, you guys are killing me here
@WehliyeMohamed Hapana, we reject that offer by non-local members of King'eero like you. Before she comes, the elders led by Parmenaus Wamamunyu Wa Gathiminu and Kamangu Ndimu Nyokabi must slaughter a hen at Kiandumuna Kanthong'oria shrines
@JeniferShamalla So the tanks on Harare roads, the gunfires around Mugabe's residence (CNN) and the seizure of the state broadcaster were a raid on an NGO? Aiih Wakili yawa, usitupige vichwa duster hivyo, sisi sio wajiiinga saaaana
@EAukot The foolishness is when a lawyer with a doctor of philosophy in law cannot write the word "disappointing" well! You ought to know better as well

@bonifacemwangi @WanjeriNderu @bonifacemwangi , utaachanga ukweli kama hizo, unaumiza wengine!!
@ahmednasirlaw Looks like Eukot's supporters lack bundles..., donge?
@fnoluga @bonifacemwangi And for 45 million people, we have 349 MPs,  67 Senators, 47 governors and 2526 MCAs out of which 774 are nominated!  Kenyans have more nominated MCAs than doctors! We are a unique country daktari!
"There is no crisis in Kenya, why should Raila and Uhuru dialogue?" anyone familiar with this hackneyed phrase from Jubilee diehards like the master benchfixer @ahmednasirlaw https://t.co/kMsy8dYqOw
@EAukot Daktari di you take your drugs in the morning? please, take them consistently, we fear losing you son of a Nomad
@EAukot Daktari, can you make it to court to sue the media for using Raila's image in the SCORK petition yet we know it should be you against Uhuru? Demand that the TV banner change to Eukot Vs Uhuru. Take what is rightfully yours sir!
@kenyanpundit Unlike the national government ang'owa?

@IBRAHIMMALE @cobbo3 Hahahahahaaaaa, now this is interesting
@ahmednasirlaw Ile siku Raila and Uhuru watakaa chini to resolve the political problems in Kenya si utajinyonga tu
Kwani daktari, lazima ujibu kila mtu who writes on your wall. Si saa zingine ujifanye tu a little mature and ignore these exchanges now that you are the leader of opposition yawa @EAukot
@davidmakali1 Heheheheee, that response was "responsorious"
@citizentvkenya Everyone's safety is state responsibility!!

@RevKathyKiuna What if I already have a good car, will I fly a chopper before the end of December?

@TheStarKenya OOops, looks like the loquacious senator needs to focus less on Raila and more on pressing issues in his county
@DonaldBKipkorir, our institutions are generally appendages for the political class it seems...,very sad for my country
@AnitaNderu @DjJoeMfalme @asfawards Other than being best dressed, any sensible contribution you have made to the country as a media personality?
@AKoronto @MediaCouncilK Humans are funny, having a conference on protecting journalists, aren't we supposed to protect every human being, doctors, watchmen, teachers, even those who protect us must be protected as well!!
@DonaldBKipkorir Wakili, what do u mean by "depoliticising" taxation?
@DrKanyuira @kamonjomaina matatu za Hiyo stage ni namba?

@kipmurkomen Heheheheeee, mheshimiwa, sometimes it is just good to keep quiet
@Trevygunz @okothkenneth Probably, our government is learning of what happened through your tweets. We will then form a commision of inquiry to "investigate" what happened, then the commision will go for a retreat to write a report on the same and wait for it to be implemented "soon"
Heheheeeee, my ribs ache https://t.co/M3BspbtenU
@EAukot @Thirdwaykenya I wish the son of a nomad knew how less we care about his bribery or lack of it. We are too busy looking for our next meal sir, continue with the cheapness narrative in the next election

@ahmednasirlaw "He who knows not and knows not that he knows not is a fool."
@Wakabando Good work mheshimiwa, we need voice of reason at such times. Kenya will triumph in the end

@noonanjo @wgkantai Probably, he had an idea of the ball-point biro being inserted into your left ear....
But one day when we are sober as Kenyans, we will ask the government what they did, and we will not be expecting "Raila" as an answer https://t.co/E5DaoUrGL1
Tmrow, baba may declare that we'll have elections on 26th and Uhuru rejects it, NASArites and JUBIlites will quickly swap positions!!!
People demonstrating that Raila and Uhuru should not talk to remove the stalemate in the country! God what is wrong with Kenyans?
@ahmednasirlaw Heheheee, grandmullah feeling threatened
Look at the pple lecturing Kenyans on politics: Spending all their youthful energy singing abt women, partying,  love, booze and money! https://t.co/PZRMvrd8m3

You pass a new constitution then give two gentlemen who opposed it an opportunity to implement it, but Kenyans must be the biggest fools!
A stray bullet: "A bullet that leaves the barrel without being fired and wanders in the air to find something to hit."
Some policeman will retreat home to his wife and kids today after a hard work - having butchered a high school student!
Weeping with Somalia...., for Somalia...,in solidarity with you, one day, Allah will restore peace to Somalia
At the end of the day today, some demonstrators will be shot dead, some will lose their property. These are all Kenyans with legit concerns
There are many angles by which you can fall, but only one to stand!!
@kipmurkomen Would we rather have violence in our country or an inclusive government?
@FredMatiangi @YvonneOkwara Can the parents of baby Pendo and Moraa come too? they lost two gems
@Waambui Yet we are distracted by the narrative that Raila is the problem Kenya has.
@LarryMadowo Larry that will be a little harder, why can't he just ban the parliament. There's more violence in Kenyan parliament than anywhere else

Look Kenyans, Murkomen just tweeted, and he didn't mention Raila in the tweet. Kenya is more united than ever!! https://t.co/cZ4zUYLQSv
@FredMatiangi The irony is that a "mature democracy" is being denied the avenue of demonstrating to express their views.

The most worrying thing is that there are people cheering Moses Kuria while spewing that bile. Destroying our own country
@Disembe @JBoinnet Dikembe please, do not combine the Kenyan policeman and the word "rule of law" in the same sentence!
Even the most bigoted tribal dimwit would find Moses Kuria a nuisance but then again, the king prefers him free, political expediency

@GrantBrooke I ask the same of the political bloggers....
In Migori, Nyaga has 400 extra votes as compared to the portal
Comparing portal to Chebukati: In Kisumu, Raila's votes are 30,000 less, Uhuru's votes are 200 less
The results are varying with the portal. In Wajir, Uhuru has been deducted 1, 800 votes, Raila deducted 320!!
LAMU 	Chebukati   : Total valid votes - 49, 213: 	IEBC Portal  : Total valid votes - 49, 516	many variations!!

God knows why Miguna parted ways with Raila. I would be peeing on myself if he was present at Bomas with all this standoff!! Peace!!

@andyjomo @OwuorMichael Good, but to fight who? Raila wanted to fight someone and why?
We don't have any volunteer to get into the IEBC servers to give us the right results?
@SaddiqueShaban am scared too honestly..., we are walking down that  path and I hope it won't happen
@gathara @Benogola @EAukot @UKenyatta @IEBCKenya The problem of having attention seekers as presidential candidates!!!
If you did not cram the face of your MP/Senator/MCA/Governor this week, too bad for you, the next time you see him/her again will be in 2022
good job @K24Tv  for the IT guy expositions on IEBC servers, we want media to query issues like this, not consumers of raw news
@IkeOjuok I have the same feeling that we lost too, it is however ok to demand that IEBC wafanye as required by law
@K24Tv Is it possible to get the NASA IT guy to debate with this guy? I like how the media is trying to help us understand though
@CarolineMutoko @shirogaitho Does it mean that nobody should question what IEBC does? it is our responsibility. Accountability a must, but no violence at all!
Interesting statistic here for the number crunchers!!! https://t.co/7LlRvKLt3M

when I become the president, I will make you my deputy bro. We are not fighting, No, No, No. My mass action was on my vote!!
...and the ghosts of form 34s have followed us to 2017. God, let sobriety prevail here, Peace folks, we will get done with this!!
We must question  processes  and hold IEBC to accountability but WE ARE NOT FIGHTING, it is not war, mass action or protests, NO!
@LeonLidigu Good, am waiting for my trusted news papa hapa, the mainstream media waendelee na their armchair political analyses

@ItsMutai @JBoinnet @C_NyaKundiH @Disembe @Asamoh_ @DavidNdii @Maskani254 @johngithongo @NCIC_Kenya Why should we worry about a brainless being typing, we need to take him to the lab and study how he manages to type without a brain!

@mmnjug "Goebbels" Itumbi...hahahahaaaa, my ribs will break before I go to Canaan yawa, I don't want to go to Canaan without a rib
Right now, it seems as if Daktari is the head of the nation. Can someone tell my president to at least calm the fears of his citizens now? https://t.co/lnSycLkJGS
Don't I just like the piety in this nation after every five years! https://t.co/3xvmIFUu1m
This is when a good president would calm the citizens and tell them all is well, we are still one nation but Lo! Not forthcoming
The armchair political analysts like Sandra Ocholla, you only have week and elections will be gone! Time to try blogging!
@UKenyatta Mheshimiwa when you retire, whichever year, please, call me so that we can talk about Tiaty constituency results of 2013
Sadly, Msando's death will join the growing statistics of unsolved murders in Kenya. Britain please, here is a colony, please recolonize us!
@MwauraWambiru We are held hostage by two devils in the country!!
@EAukot I agree with you daktari, at such times, silence is betrayal...
The only solution to this country, make devolution work and make presidency less appealing. The death of Msando should worry everyone!!

Some people are wise, others are "otherwise"!!!
Restrained badness is the worst form of goodness!

It is called eating life with a big spoon!!! https://t.co/3jSUBidYze

@WilliamsRuto Yes, the winner takes a ready title deed of 10 acres land in Canaan
Radio presenters, it is not fair to ask jobless youths to photo themselves early at 7 a.m to show where they are "listening from."
@DavidNdii and @IEAKwame , I trust you with numbers, I do not want to speculate. What am i not getting right here in terms of costs
Mbita Bridge: Length - 160 M, width - 50 M, Cost 817 M. Sigiri bridge: length - 50M, width - 25M, cost 1.2 B https://t.co/vskLQn8VE2

@KBonimtetezi I just wonder how national politics will be without mtetezi. The "Kimunyas" and the "Rutos" will be the biggest beneficiary of your exit!!

Just wondering, can we measure our intelligence based on a one hour exam paper? who saw how articulate @HassanAliJoho was yesterday?
Just when I was about to denounce ODM nomination violence, I see bullets flying in Jubilee polls, Britain please, recolonize us!!!
Kidogo kidogo, utasikia ODM has postponed itself! I tell you we have a governance crisis: an incompetent government and a lame opposition!
@mbuguagiuseppe hehehe, interesting!!! these are the things distracting Kenya from issue based politics. I wish we focus on who can govern our country best!
@gathara @wmnjoya Time to ask ourselves, is the problem with the Kenyan education system about its structure?
@AliHassanDayib @ntvkenya I fully agree wit you. They are making Jubilee appear good!
@RobertAlai @JunetMohamed @HassanAliJoho Na mwenye alichukua hii picha yako kwa court, hakutumia simu? meanwhile, google the meaning of "contempt of court" itakusaidia sana

@ngunjiriwambugu @abedlelgo @RailaOdinga I admire you as the next generation of politicians but ain't you focusing too much on Raila? can we have a national narrative beyond RAO?
@VictorKiprop_ @kenyanpundit @kenyanwalstreet @alykhansatchu politics aside, is this a reflection of a growing economy?
@HonAdenDuale And mheshimiwa, in honouring the fallen comrades, would you now release the promised list of terrorists and financiers?

@RobertAlai How do we trust the information we get from Alai if he cannot even spell the word dais correctly?
@DavidNdii hehehehee, it is hard to be an intellect in Kenya, you are damned if you do something and damned if you don't
@SenMutula Thank you senator, always a voice of reason..!! Let the principles sit and decide themselves and give us a candidate
@ngunjiriwambugu Getting a D- is criminal?
Thank you Lord, at least some good news in the country...madaktari warudi kazini
Our government competing with the opposition/governors in developmental matters, can't Britain just recolonize us please!!
..still waiting for @OleItumbi to give us "facts" about the tirades of the president in Turkana. Where is "System ya facts" bro?
As we import doctors, the Jubilee government should also consider exporting all the politicians as well...., and don't forget their bloggers
just imagining.., if our leaders were this sober the way they are in Gachagua's funeral, who needs political bloggers?
Can we just have a hands on president like this just for one year!! https://t.co/IfDMHZjWLe

@OleItumbi @QuincyWandera  assuming these are the tweets of the day, have you given out the list of the MRC financiers?
@LeonLidigu @OleItumbi Mtego wa panya huingiliwa na waliomo na wasiokuwemo!!!
@EAukot team up with others like Philip Murgor and give us a meaningful leadership, at least you are not part of the "establishment."
@EAukot the thought of Jubilee as a govt makes me sick, and the thought of the opposition as an alternative govt makes me even sicker!!
@OleItumbi even my one year old son knows that any good remuneration for doctors equals good service delivery for Kenyans...
@ahmednasirlaw @WehliyeMohamed @MboyaApollo @jamessmat Grand Mullah, in Luo, we say "football is ajua" ask @MboyaApollo...watch the space.
@junior_mutula Waiguru in Kirinyaga, "Dr" Mugo in Kasarani, Farouk Kibet in DPs office, Kabura josephine in the salon, Githinji at home...
Dear govt, just turn the public hospitals into party offices and the universities to private members clubs,we'll still remain Kenya!!
@bonifacemwangi...if you have to join politics, please mentor someone to take over, I fear politics will dilute your integrity!!!
@OleItumbi The same constitution demands that a post of Director in the govt should be held by an individual with Master's degree...
