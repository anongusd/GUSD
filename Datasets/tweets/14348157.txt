More important, every independent forecaster (Fed, CBO, IMF, PWBM, TPC) indeed predicted stronger growth in 2018, thanks to fiscal stimulus from both tax cuts + spending hike. The bigger question is how sustainable that faster growth is, once stimulus fades &amp; demographics worsen
E.g., here's a look at % change from quarter a year ago going back to mid-2000s https://t.co/2KSK2eUEmK
This is a peculiarly specific and somewhat misleading target. Yes, it's the first time % change from quarter-a-year-ago growth hit &gt;3% during the *4th* quarter in a while.

@amitabhchandra2 Question is whether you could actually execute such a policy that doesn‚Äôt punish lots of people who are not shirking. Is it possible, given the challenges low-income workers face, and the costs of the bureaucracy required to make sure you‚Äôre not causing undue hardship?
@amitabhchandra2 I have heard this from conservatives as well: adding work requirements may make red states feel comfortable with expanding Medicaid. UT is pursuing a waiver to add work requirements, and voters just expanded Medicaid by ballot initiative.

Arkansas added Medicaid work requirements. 	Reporting is online-only, not by phone, mail, office. 	Also, state has lowest home internet access in the country. 	And the website *shuts down every day at 9pm.*	No surprise that 12k kicked off Medicaid so far https://t.co/eQgWrG2BGS

@AmericanAir You still owe me for the hotel bill tonight. The only reason I'm staying in a hotel is that you ran out of fuel, caused us to depart over an hour late, made me miss a connecting flight, and then left me waiting in line and on hold while all subsequent flights tonight departed
Forgot to mention that during the time I waited in airport customer service line -- and also for @AmericanAir *phone* customer service line -- I missed multiple subsequent flights that could have gotten me back home, tonight.
@AmericanAir Your airport team refused to help me. They claimed the system would not let them cover my hotel because the @AmericanAir "system" blamed the delay on "air traffic control." There was NO air traffic control issue. The problem was that you ran out of fuel. Pilot told us many times.
@AmericanAir This is unacceptable. You lie about covering a hotel room. You lie about why *you* caused me to miss connecting flight. You rebook me on *wrong* flight back, and lie that you can‚Äôt correct over the phone. Why would you ever treat your customers this way?
@AmericanAir Also, BS that hotel decisions are handled only by airport team. Airport team said they were not allowed to pay for hotel b/c ‚Äúsystem‚Äù said issue was ‚Äúair traffic control.‚Äù There was no air traffic control issue. Pilot told us multiple times problem was that you ran out of fuel
@AmericanAir Also your airport team booked me on THE WRONG FLIGHT BACK. I realized only after I left the airport . I called customer service and they refused to change it to the correct flight. They said I have to go back to airport. Will not fix over the phone
.@AmericanAir pilot specifically told us to tell customer service that the problem was fuel so that we would get comp hotel. Instead, after waiting in like 20 min to talk with rep, I was told I was on my own.
This is insane. I missed connecting flight because @AmericanAir de-icing machine *ran out of fuel* and we sat on runway for over an hour while we waited for someone to get fuel. Now refusing to pay for hotel while I am stranded. There‚Äôs a reason I never flight this awful airline
