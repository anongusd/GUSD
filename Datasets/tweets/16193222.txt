I personally suspect much of this statement is true, though Cohen is unquestionably a deeply embittered and disgruntled former employee with an enormous axe to grind. He‚Äôs also been convicted of lying under oath. I take anything he cannot definitively prove with a chunk of salt.
People who love Trump will furiously dismiss virtually all of what Cohen is saying as self-serving sour grapes &amp; pandering to the opposition. Those who hate Trump will eagerly lap up every scathing word and anecdote.
Importantly, Cohen says Trump did not direct him to lie to Congress (though he argues it was implied) ‚Äî another blow to Buzzfeed‚Äôs story ‚Äî and that he has no direct evidence of Russian collusion (but he says he has suspicions).
The president‚Äôs ethics are poor. The portrait/straw purchaser allegation (w/ documentation) is an almost-comical vignette of petty ego &amp; ethical bankruptcy. The Stormy hush payments seem undeniable. I‚Äôm dubious that they constitute a crime that justifies impeachment.
As someone who has always believed Trump to be a man of low character, much of this rings true to me (some details are verifiable, some are not). Regardless of my support or opposition on various policies, I refuse to pretend POTUS is anything other than what he is.

@HugeFanOfThings Nope.
@DrJasonJohnson My support is literally the video itself, which I urge everyone to watch. I very much welcome this competition of fair-mindedness and honesty. I won‚Äôt take needless cheap shots at you. Thank you for your revealing approach to this entire matter, start to finish.
@DrJasonJohnson In fact, you offered 2 explanations of the substance of the ‚Äòfact check,‚Äô both of which are wrong. I don‚Äôt care if you want to blast out misrepresentations to your followers, but I do care about j-school profs‚Äô adherence to accuracy more broadly, so this has been disappointing.
You may cast aspersions, but I‚Äôm not the one acting like a partisan here. Wallace laughed off the awkwardness of Graham not replying, as Graham clearly did not realize he was still on camera. There was no ‚Äúhuff.‚Äù People don‚Äôt have to ‚Äòbelieve‚Äô me over you. They can just watch. https://t.co/DCu7WrHTBo
Last point, which I think explains your mischaracterization: This explanation of Wallace‚Äôs ‚Äúfact check‚Äù is just inaccurate, setting aside its tendentiousness on the relevant history. Wallace briefly explained the context of the ‚Äúnuclear option‚Äù debate &amp; Graham *did not disagree.* https://t.co/gsgV7WdY1t
Transparent projection. I hope everyone watches the video (https://t.co/2QtjVKm4bc), then considers your description of what transpired (https://t.co/F3CjrjVWbN) vs. mine (https://t.co/IBDdrOWXbj | https://t.co/DHBDWehQ5p). #TakeTheL https://t.co/aeTv8VEfoq
No deal, professor. You are in the wrong &amp; doubling down. I urge people to watch the back-and-forth in question (starting ~12:30 through the end) &amp; decide who is misrepresenting this exchange. https://t.co/2QtjVKm4bc https://t.co/kOsBZTplgw
@ksliz22 @brithume The longer Raw Story video shows Graham obviously not hearing Wallace, not knowing he was still on screen, and calmly removing his mic, thinking it was over. The exchange did not end with a heated fact check or anyone leaving in a huff. Not even close.
@pamelaclearwood @FoxNews what are you talking about?
@GPollowitz Correct.
@DrJasonJohnson I hope you teach your students to get people‚Äôs names right. The only hot take here is your misrepresentation. Wallace contextualized Graham‚Äôs (accurate) point about Reid, LG got the last word, then there was an awkward silence when LG thought the segment was over.
My name is not Ben. I watched the entire thing. You entirely misrepresented Wallace‚Äôs ‚Äúfact check,‚Äù Graham did not leave in a huff, and he started taking off his mic after he thought the interview was over. The longer video does not help your case. https://t.co/30XiCO2mqL

@chrislhayes As for the relative severity of the overall problem and where it should fall on the national priority list, that‚Äôs obviously a subjective judgment. My ‚Äúranking‚Äù probably falls somewhere between yours and the president‚Äôs.
@chrislhayes Visa overstays are certainly a major challenge, as well. No argument from me on that.
@chrislhayes Well we know that only ~20% of those claims are granted, while roughly one third are outright rejected. The others fall by the wayside etc. There absolutely *are* some significant # of false/baseless claims. There‚Äôs also all the illegal immigrants who make no asylum claim at all.
@authoridad All *in that program.* Overall, genuine asylum seekers do show up for proceedings at a much higher rate than overall non-detained illegal immigrants.
@chrislhayes Seeking asylum is not illegal. Falsely ‚Äúseeking asylum‚Äù is an abuse of our system that creates thorny challenges.
@chrislhayes I shouldn‚Äôt have said that ‚Äúmost‚Äù don‚Äôt show up for proceedings ‚Äî that‚Äôs not accurate ‚Äî but many non-detained immigrants do not: ~25-40% according to this data https://t.co/MZuo39pWqs		No-shows are def lower among bona fide asylum seekers. But many do not fit that bill.
