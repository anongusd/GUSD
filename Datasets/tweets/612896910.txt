@louishyman @alexjscolvin In other words, if a strike/lockout isn't ongoing during the pay period that includes the 12th of the month (the reference period for our monthly nonfarm employment survey), it likely won't appear on this list. 2/2
@louishyman @alexjscolvin It does include public sector. We found on the list a few examples in public education and public transit. There aren't that many public-sector strikes, however. This report focuses on the effects of strikes/lockouts on employment estimates for each month. 1/2
@alexjscolvin @louishyman We also have a more comprehensive measure of strikes/lockouts (back to 1990) that we use to understand the monthly nonfarm employment numbers. This measure includes work stoppages of all sizes. See:	https://t.co/0JWwT8exrk		Also see:	https://t.co/kdjiKOJhjY

The new #BLSdata give us our first look at establishments with foreign ownership at the county level. Let's look at employment levels. https://t.co/woBruDlhSG
Foreign companies invest in larger and older U.S. companies.	• 71% of employment in 2012 was in companies with 1,000 or more employees	• 91% of employment in 2012 was in companies that were at least 20 years old
Companies with foreign ownership:	• Employed 5.52 million workers in 2012, 5.0% of the workforce	• Paid workers, on average, $74,953 a year
Establishments with Japanese ownership had 193,000 jobs in production occupations in 2012.
Establishments with foreign ownership had over 988,000 jobs in production occupations in 2012.
Establishments with foreign ownership paid more than domestically owned establishments for 17 of 22 occupational groups in 2012.
These estimates include not only new industry and geographic detail on employment in U.S. establishments with foreign ownership, but also estimates of employment and wages for detailed occupations.
For the first time in nearly 25 years, BLS and @BEA_News released detailed estimates of U.S. employment in establishments with foreign ownership in the United States. Learn the details at https://t.co/gIk9bfFmZ2 #BLSdata https://t.co/f6H80r4TOJ

@SoquelCreek You're very welcome! We're happy to help.
@SoquelCreek No, you're not interpreting it correctly. Both measures are rates of growth over a 12-month period. Health insurance costs are not a component of wage and salary costs.
@SoquelCreek That chart just shows 12-month percent changes in total compensation. The darker blue line shows changes for private industry. The lighter blue line shows changes for state and local government. The underlying data are from a longer report at https://t.co/Ou71jz4rJ1
@SoquelCreek No, that's not correct. Private employer health insurance costs rose less rapidly (+1.8% over the year) than costs for all benefits (+2.6%) or wages and salaries (+3.1%).		Health insurance accounts for ~7.5% of private employer compensation costs. See https://t.co/BZEIZCzKDP

@jaqi67 We forget to mention it when we answered your question about multiple jobholders, but we published a short article, with a chart, last summer that you may find helpful.	https://t.co/0IguXiwb8S
@jaqi67 The CPS response rate has been around 86-87% in recent years. You can learn more about the technical details of the CPS at https://t.co/swO0vmgwWL		You can learn more about response rates in the CPS (and all our other surveys) at https://t.co/OR6lJvy1n3		3/end
@jaqi67 The CPS sample size is about 60,000 U.S. households each month. Typically one person in the household answers questions about her/himself and all the other people who live in the household. That comes out to around 105,000 people per month. 2/N
@jaqi67 No, that's not correct. The source of the data on multiple jobholding is the Current Population Survey, or CPS for short. That's the same survey from which we gather info on the unemployment rate, demographic characteristics of the labor force, and much more. 1/N

@eWhispers @LizAnnSonders @KathyJones That's correct, but note some other scenarios. For example, someone in hurricane-affected area who was not employed on 9/12 but might have started a job later in pay period but didn't because of the hurricane. Also, hurricane could affect hours and weekly earnings, not just emp.
@eWhispers @LizAnnSonders @KathyJones This is not correct. The cutoff is NOT the 12th of the month. The survey reference period is the pay period that includes the 12th, which could extend beyond Florence making landfall. See paragraph 3 of our Commissioner's statement for more info: https://t.co/QvHcxfWA5q

@AlanTonelson @JStein_WaPo Yep, those data are from the Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages. That's an administrative database of all establishments covered by federal and state UI. As such, it lags the monthly employment survey by about half a year.
@aaronwflee The OES program expanded its scope in 1996 to produce wage estimates. This expansion required us to use 3 years of collected data to produce each year of estimates. Because we only had 1 year of wage data available, we couldn't publish reliable estimates for 1996.

@AlanTonelson @LarryMishel @EricaGroshen The cost levels are also useful for comparing differences in compensation between, say, different occupations or industries and whether those differences have grown larger or smaller over time. 2/2
@AlanTonelson @LarryMishel @EricaGroshen We believe the cost levels are very valuable, but they are not ideal for analyzing cost trends; that's what the ECI is for. The cost levels are very useful for comparing compensation across different groups at a point in time, which can't be done with the ECI. 1/2

@alan_kruss Purpose of numbers in top picture is to provide users with employment changes as they were originally published. That enables users to see the size of monthly revisions to data. It also enables researchers to see, for example, how financial markets responded to original reports.
@EdNCES @gm_palmer The BLS pay data you see are medians. We also have means and percentiles (10th, 25th, 75th, and 90th) at:	https://t.co/sAHuCB7SLT		That pay information is just for secondary school teachers. Similar information for other education occupations is at:	https://t.co/a9CshQC7QE
@alan_kruss The numbers in the bottom picture also reflect the annual benchmark revisions. You can read more about those revisions at:	https://t.co/4U2497xj8E
@gm_palmer @EdNCES may have some information that can help. Here's a list of their surveys:	https://t.co/c9M4zIoDAm		Their National Teacher and Principal Survey seems like one possibility. See:	https://t.co/qcgmv9Je15
@gm_palmer This only includes teachers. More info on other education, training, and library jobs at:	https://t.co/nwzNNiqszv		Info on school counselors at:	https://t.co/TRBHrHxf1C		Info on principals at:	https://t.co/ketxmCjnlm		We don't have info on average age and experience for teachers.

@ErinLAlbert Someone with a "wage and salary" job and is also self-employed is counted as a multiple jobholder.
@ErinLAlbert Also, data on multiple jobholding is available at:	https://t.co/7Y7MVC7VFZ		Muultiple jobholding rate has been pretty steady at about 5% of employment in recent years. The rate for women is slightly higher than for men.
@ErinLAlbert People with two or more jobs are classified in the job they worked the most hours during the survey reference week. For example, someone who worked 40 hours in a "wage and salary" job and 10 hours in a self-employed business would be classified in the wage and salary job.
@ErinLAlbert We also have a more recent analysis of self-employment, including self-employed women:	https://t.co/SoJI56VGGk

@darkmomedy Another 652,000 were unemployed--that is, not working but actively seeking work.
@darkmomedy In 2015, there were 16 million mothers of kids under age 6. Of that total, 9.6 million were employed (7.1 mil FT, 2.6 mil PT).
@darkmomedy ...for work are "not in the labor force." Let's look at table 5 of the report.

@pabischoff For data on foreign born in the U.S. labor force, see https://t.co/HfuQlM01cZ
@pabischoff Important to keep in mind that emp gain among foreign born doesn't necessarily mean job loss among U.S. natives.
@pabischoff Job effects of immigration are also complex and hard to measure. We do have employment data on the foreign born.
@pabischoff The short answer is no. The longer answer is, of course, more complex. Tech/automation often leads to both job gains and losses.

@joerock9 Even if hiring falls, the net employment level can rise if separations fall more than hires. Does this explanation help?
@joerock9 Also, May numbers don't show hiring as down. It's about the same as April. We did report decline in job openings, however.
@joerock9 As we reported Friday, June's net job gain was +287k, and May's was +11k.
@joerock9 Keep in mind the numbers out this morning on hires &amp; separations are for May. The job numbers that came out Friday were for June.
