@bkozak85 @CeilimomKate @whyfullyblind @TinaMorphis @realDonaldTrump @POTUS 98% of Obama’s pardons or commutations were for low level drug crimes that, if sentenced today would have received lesser sentences. He didn’t tweet about how terribly our country treated these people. Generally, Presidents use this power relatively quietly as they leave office.
@bill_clintons @realDonaldTrump @POTUS OMG you don’t have to look too hard to find a reason to criticize him. I’m not missing any points. I’d be happy to find faults across party lines. I see his faults for myself, not through the lens of MSM. It’s pretty obvious. Sadly, he’s destroying the @GOP and polarizing the USA
@bill_clintons @realDonaldTrump @POTUS My concern is not with the pardon, but @realDonaldTrump use of it while making a statement about our government being unfair. THAT is the issue - undermining the judicial system publicly. The purpose of which is clearly to pit Americans against each other.
@bill_clintons @realDonaldTrump @POTUS If so, sure...I’d say the same thing about him.
@bill_clintons @realDonaldTrump @POTUS Did Obama make a public statement that any of those pardoned people were treated unfairly by our government? 💁🏼‍♀️
@Mdhida95 @realDonaldTrump @POTUS Again, it’s not about the pardon. It’s about his disparaging the US government in the process.
@Saint_Issa @whyfullyblind @TinaMorphis @realDonaldTrump @POTUS He is secretly loving the MSM because he knows that even bad press is good press, as the saying goes. Their commentary creates an environment for his fans to rally around him. The MSM is his best frenomy!

@realDonaldTrump @GOP owned industries 🏭🚜🔨💰hire 1000s of undocumented to keep costs down. They publicly talk about keeping immigrants out but privately keep on hiring. THEY are the #1 reason for border crossing. Stop the illegal employment vs. demonizing those they entice to come here.

@realDonaldTrump Clearly you are backpedaling after the thousands of tweets showing you criticizing Obama for exactly what you are doing. Sad! Fishing for accolades- sadder!
@realDonaldTrump Like when you pretended to be other people and called in to news stations in the 80s, looking for free PR. This ain’t your first rodeo @realDonaldTrump . It takes a faker to know a faker! You are a self promoting man desperate for the spotlight and you will Tweet yourself away...

@realDonaldTrump Do you really think that just because they spend a week on gun control, they forgot about #DACA ? Think again, if only it was that easy for you!

@Ellen4usa @JoyAnnReid Exactly, and Trump doesn’t discuss this problem with illegal immigration because it benefits businesses and the government. Investigating and  prosecuting employers would slow border crossings faster than building a wall. But that’s not a popular conversation. Follow the 💰💰💰
@Ellen4usa @JoyAnnReid Unscrupulous employers will hire them with SS numbers that are no longer being used. They are paid on the payroll and taxes are taken out, but they are never able to file returns or get social security. So tax 💰 is going into the system due to this.

@PressSec This is by far the best White House communication this administration has ever had! Awesome 👏
@NirodhaTW @zabster24 @DonaldsDaddy45 @aliasvaughn @maddow Sincerely, I tend to believe that Bill and HRC have taken time to laugh here and there in the last year. Maybe they’re also laughing at Trump’s ridiculous attempt to pretend he’s exceptionally healthy.  8But, we all definitely GET IT. We’re all disgusted by this man.
@chucktodd @RandPaul It’s not so much about the people calling names as the behavior that justifies the moniker @randpaul . Everyone involved would LOVE to just go to work every day and do their jobs without this kind of distraction causing chaos!
You can’t make this stuff up. This whole world is like an out of control high school where everyone is cyber bullying each other and nobody knows what they’re talking about! https://t.co/DESUNdrWhA
@FoxNews @PressSec @sendavidperdue Envy? You have got to be kidding!
@zabster24 We’re all frustrated. 99% of what I do on here is a frustrated response to Trump’s behavior.
@Christmas_Eve1 @haroldisaac You....madam, are a real asshole.
@DonaldsDaddy45 @zabster24 It’s true, I added HRC twice because I contend that she would think this to be hilariously funny. Until now, because it’s getting dark and the infighting is going nowhere. This much nonsense about a silly joke is ridiculous. 🤦🏼‍♀️
@DonaldsDaddy45 @zabster24 @HillaryClinton So please retract the moonshine and banjo statement and let’s move on! PS - no one ever said Democrats cannot enjoy moonshine and banjos, BTW. You gotta live a little!
@haroldisaac @rjakes65 Don’t show @realDonaldTrump too many nice pictures or he’ll gentrify the whole place with high priced condos and country clubs.
@Sj21Shane @samstein @PressSec @yashar @realDonaldTrump Really, a liberal pushed that button? So, you’re going with that conspiracy theory? 🤦🏼‍♀️
@zabster24 @DonaldsDaddy45 This tweet is about Trump’s physical fitness or lack there of. Not only do I support his predecessor for keeping fit, but Bill especially for being so fun loving as to wear fuchsia. @HillaryClinton I believe would agree ❤️

@PressSec President Trump's grades on most character traits are down as voters say: 63 - 34 % that he is not honest; 59 - 39 % that he does not have good leadership skills; 59 - 38 % that he does not care about average Americans; 65 - 32 % that he does not share their values.
@PressSec tried to retrieve a nugget of positivity whilst ignoring glaring negatives found in this Quinnipiac Poll info: https://t.co/WKKZbkP4Lz
@PressSec Only 24 percent of voters say Trump policies are helping their personal financial situation, while 26 percent say his policies are hurting them and 47 percent say his policies are not making a difference. 	-Quinnipiac Poll
@PressSec President Donald Trump is intelligent, American voters say 53 - 44 percent, one of his lowest scores since Inauguration day, but voters say 69 - 28 percent that he is not level-headed and 57 - 40 percent that he is not fit to serve as president, according to a Quinnipiac Poll
@PressSec In an open-ended question, allowing any answer, 69 voters (not percent) describe Trump's first year in office as a "disaster," 62 say "chaotic," 44 say "successful," 28 say "horrible," 27 say "great," 26 say "good," 24 say "terrible," 24 say "embarrassing" 23 say "interesting."

@ChristinaChere2 @FoxNews @POTUS Yep
@svagnorok @FoxNews @AnnCoulter @POTUS Check your American history.  You are not accurate. A visit to Ellis Island would probably be a great experience for you too! 💁🏼
@FoxNews @AnnCoulter @POTUS WOW!!!!! Try visiting Ellis Island, Ann!  This is a country founded and created via diversity and that will never change.
@dbongino Do you ever say positive things? It seems like you’re always complaining about something.
@ChristinaChere2 @FoxNews @POTUS So be it - being Commander in Chief should mean that you understand what it means to serve. 🇺🇸 It’s been a weak point of all 3
@sketchy_jeff @FoxNews @POTUS It’s not about R or D ... ultimately Bill Clifton and Obama would have been better if they had served too! It should be a requirement.
@FoxNews @POTUS Commander and Chief should be a requirement to have been enlisted. 😢
@isaiah19801980 @KarenForTrump @ELIZABETHTWET @realDonaldTrump I posted a similar poll last week on one of his tweets and had similar responses. It seems like moderate Republicans are abandoning him.
