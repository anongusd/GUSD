This is how laws are made we all should support the same issues it doesn‚Äôt matter if we are in two different political parties or not it matters that we are all Americans and we should show each other respect in return we all want the best for our states
And you‚Äôre constituents, stop the political divide this doesn‚Äôt mean anything doesn‚Äôt do anything just causes chaos and confusion like what we all see in the debates calling names, and everything else must stop this is not a death match
