@SpeakerPelosi Thank you Madame Speaker.
But let me get to the point. After watching what is occurring in politics and the world I have come to some very disappointing conclusions. Many of our elected and appointed leaders have some very undemocratic motives. They border on oligarchy. Now McConnell has been uncovered.
Good morning America! It is a great morning to wake up in the greatest country that has ever existed, conceptually. The God I believe in is a great, kind and loving God that only wants the best for me and humanity. I very rarely have bad days, maybe moments. They are fleeting.
@timrote @WalshFreedom Does this type of rule sound familiar to you? If not you better look at all those or let me say most of our politicians, those that have wealth, sickening wealth, wealth like Solomon. A lot of those type of politicians qualify to be included in the "elitist" labeling.
@timrote @WalshFreedom Dictatorship - a form of government in which a ruler or small clique wield absolute power (not restricted by a constitution or laws). ... Oligarchy - a government in which control is exercised by a small group of individuals whose authority generally is based on wealth or power.
@timrote @WalshFreedom If you look at further control of essential services being taken over by the government and those who agree with this policy, I would suggest that it borders on dictatorship or more specifically; oligarchy............

@BrianFrosh She indicated that she didn't and told me that the state had decided to drop my Theft charge and pick up the fabricated Assault charges against me. I was flabbergasted, upset. This man had turned my life upside down for no reason and he wasn't going to have to answer.
@BrianFrosh Upon arriving I was instructed that the landlord had filed Assault charges against me and I inquired why he had waited 4 days to do so. I also told her that I never assaulted the man. He is 6'2" 250 pounds and I am 5'6" 140 pounds. I asked her if she noticed that.
@BrianFrosh She told me that I should also file civil charges and explained that the ceiling in district court was $5,000 and $33,000 in Circuit Court. She awarded me the Theft charges and I was then scheduled to meet with the State's Attorney on October 11 - 13. I went there.
@BrianFrosh I did so but the commissioner informed me that because I was in possession of the trailer I would be unable to file illegal eviction charges. This confused but I did as she instructed. I subsequently filed felony Theft charges for the property he threw away.
@BrianFrosh I went to the Rent Court at Fayette and Gay immediately the next morning. The gentleman on the 3rd floor (an attorney) outlined the steps I should proceed with to protect myself. He instructed me to go the Commissioner's office on Calvert St. and file charges.
@BrianFrosh He towed the trailer with my cat and I in it from Haven and Lombard to Berk Avenue in Rosedale. He simply dropped the trailer on Berk Ave. and left. Before he had towed the trailer he had put his elbow through the window next to the entry door cutting his elbow.
@BrianFrosh He gave me no opportunity to pay the rent for October. He lied to Baltimore City Police officers saying I had the trailer put on his property without his permission. His actions border on delusion. When the Police left he proceeded to tow the trailer with me in it.
@BrianFrosh The case is fabricated anyway. It resulted as a result of an illegal eviction on October 1st, 2018. I had been renting a property from this man for three years, but for some unknown reason, he decided to start disposing off my worldly possessions that afternoon.
@BrianFrosh I am scheduled in Circuit Court tomorrow at 9:00 am. I will have to have the proceedings postponed because the Public Defender has never contacted me to secure my witness/subpoena list and I wasn't given an opportunity to pick the members of the jury.

.... The strategy should be created bipartisanly (is that a word? LOL It is now!). It should include a policy of central entry points like the existing spots. It forces those wanting to enter the US to be screened. The lack of a concrete policy created this problem.
.... Building a wall prevents hundreds, if not thousands of people crossing into America wherever they want. A patrol could never control this. We need to develop a strategy that incorporates the wall. President Trump is missing the point and he is supposed to be intelligent....
I have to share this just to clarify why the President is so adamant about this wall. Let me be clear. I am not a supporter. Let me say this again, I do not support Donald Trump not Hilary Clinton, crooks. His point is this....

@RealJamesWoods @phyrefligh It isn't time to approve 5 billion dollars right now. It's is too uncertain. He has created this as a diversion to the Mueller investigation to take attention off of him. Clever but not clever enough. More will be revealef, I assure you.
@DanRather @RollSallyRoll Dan, we can't approve that large expenditure right now. Filabuster it. It is important. He created this fiasco as a diversionary tactic to take the focus off of the Mueller investigation. He knew what would be uncovered. Be see through it. People listen to you.
@RepSeanDuffy @phyrefligh No. Don't waste the money. This wss all a diversionary tactic by Trump and his administration. If you don't believe me read the policy on immigrant families first. This shows you the true nature of their policy making. It is sick and delusionary.
@RepCummings @CouncilmanETC @MayorPugh50 Mr. Cummings, where is the school at?
@RepGosar @phyrefligh @POTUS Don't do it!!!!!

@PressSec @realDonaldTrump @SpeakerPelosi Sarah, I commend you. Cut them off.
@GOPLeader @phyrefligh Don't do it. Wait until he is impeached. Continue monitoring the border and add more officers but don't give him anything. Don't trust him with a dime, especially with Mueller's report leaking.  He can't be trusted. Look what he did to get elected.
@JeffMerkley @Mick_Frew @realDonaldTrump Let me be clear. Donald, you and your croanies are not human and have no empathy in your heart. You can't believe in a God. To seperate children from their parents and the resultant trauma for those children in a foreign country, in a prison. Are you serious? You supported this?
@SenGillibrand .... and don't want any pay. It would be my honor to serve this great country. Three meals a day and a bed would be compensation enough. I don't need anyone proof reading my speech. My God directs my writing. I do things for the right reason.
@SenGillibrand Let me say this to all you POLITICIAN TYPES. I don't believe a damn thing you say. It is always about you. You hire media relation people to edit and write your speeches. Stand in front of the cameras and speak from your heart. You can't, can you? I will serve the presidency....
@williamlegate Everything and his life.
@realDonaldTrump Donald, stop bring angry you made your bed now lay in it. You can no longer divert attention.
@DavidBrodyCBN @ACitizen0 @realDonaldTrump @SpeakerPelosi Mrs. Pelosi is just a woman in politics, Trump is a politician and a businessman.
@WalshFreedom Joe. I have been saying this for months, since before Christmas. My first indication of collusion was when he was elected only electorially. The first time in history and the last. It wasn't real.
@funder @realDonaldTrump Shame on you Donald. I will, never again, address you as Sir or Mr. President. You have lost that respect. You lied and are treasonous. The death penalty awaits you and your cohorts. May God help you.
@baltimoresun I must congratulate the City and Mayor Pugh and everyone involved in this decision. It shows that Baltimore can be great. This is a step towards that. This affords the Latino community a place to socialize and a central place to meet when needing services. Great job!!!!!!!!

@StackhAllan @psychdr100 We are faced with a dilemma in this Information age. The people that run for office are known only by what their media relations people decide to release to the public. We don't really know what makes these "important people" tic. What I am finding out is these people aren't OK.
@StackhAllan @psychdr100 I come from a wonderful family. Very moralistic.
@StackhAllan @psychdr100 I can recognize good people and your family are good people.
@StackhAllan @psychdr100 I kinda knew that already. I am a huge fan of basketball. North Carolina Tar Heels one of favorite.
@StackhAllan @psychdr100 Jerry, these people that profess to belive in this nonsense can not be sane. These people are running this country. Now, I don't know about you but if a person isn't thinking logical, I don't want them making life and death decisions for me on the senate floor, sorry.

@AOC Maintaining two households? That seems like unmanageability to me. You need to make a decision as to where you are going to setup shop instead of acting elitist and havingTWO households.
@psychdr100 No one is winning this shutdown. The federal workers who aren't getting paid are losing. This has reached a threshold of a joke. To think that these people in office who we have given the responsibility to govern had created such a soap opera has made the US a laughingstock.

I emailed your organization to explain I have a serious civil rights issue concerning the 14th US Constitutional Amendment. I have gotten no response. Is this where we are in America today? Is it OK for courts to throw people's lives around like they are dirty clothes?
@washingtonpost You can't come up with anything else to repair your declining sales revenue. Just go out of business like the New York Times will. The day of the printer newspaper is gone. Just like Sears went out of business. Out with the old and in with the new. You have to be flexible.
I look forward to having you question the AG. I look forward to finding out how it goes. Will there be transcript available to the public?
Amy, don't let up on him. Put him in the hot seat. It is important for you to expose him if he isn't going to be a good AG. Very important. Maybe more important then Trump. We depend on a good AG. Remember what happened to Robert Kennedy when he went against the grain.
@AdamSerwer If he said that nonsense he is an absolute moron. When did he say it, Who quoted it? When was it published? Where was he? Before I believe anything I need to check the source. I am taking nothing for granted. Too much bull crap going around. Can't prove the source? Stop!!!!!
@Pattern Odd weather patterns. Wearing short sleeves in December. Thirty years ago when fall arrived it was winter approaching, you could guarantee it. Now, I don't know what is approaching other then Armageddon. OOPs. Religion. Argument. Please forgive me.

Hi there.
@realDonaldTrump @FoxNews Forget the person attempting to rectify the situation (Mr. Trump) and just think it is YOU trying to rectify it. What would you do? or What would God do?
@realDonaldTrump @FoxNews OMG there are those capital letters. Anyway, I am not trying to rant but trying to ask people to put aside their differences and look as this problem with clear eyes and an open mind. Do you really think it is OK for this to be happening? I ask you to contemplate over this.
@realDonaldTrump @FoxNews We should want to keep this country great. If people are coming here illegally there have to be consequences. We couldn't go to their country of origin and just waltz in as though are a native or a welcome citizen. There are policy and procedures that HAVE to be adhered to.
@realDonaldTrump @FoxNews The President and any other US citizen who believes in this Country and it's values should be able to understand why this wall (even in representation) is so important. Forget all the crazy reasons people are arguing for or against this "Wall". Look at the principles involved.
@realDonaldTrump @FoxNews ..... a person to immigrate. I am sorry, we can't let just any person in. Even though we are the most welcoming country in the world, we can't have such a policy. Subsequently, people immigrating from Central America are doing so, in some cases, for the wrong reasons.
@realDonaldTrump @FoxNews ..... Central America that, in no way, parallels WWI, WWII or any other conflict that triggered an influx of immigrants. I believe in our policy but I also believe that we need to protect our people and our country. There has to be concrete reasons for this country to allow.....
@realDonaldTrump @FoxNews ..... Pearl Harbor was an event that "broke the camel's back' when WWII was being fought. The US had no choice to answer Japan's attack on Hawaii. It was a day that most would like to forget. But getting back to the original point, there doesn't exist a circumstance, in.....
@realDonaldTrump @FoxNews ..... During and after the World Wars, the US had an influx of immigrants flooding our country to flee the intolerable conditions created by these unfortunate circumstances. I honestly believe if the US could have avoided being a part of these conflicts we would have......
@realDonaldTrump @FoxNews ..... What I mean by this is, in the past, our periods of immigration from other areas in the world usually was perpetrated due to some kind of war or unrest created by a government. This, historically, defines why the US has an immigration policy......
@realDonaldTrump @FoxNews ....... Now, if this is occurring in my neighborhood, this has got to be a crisis in the country. People are fleeing Central America for good reason but there isn't necessarily circumstances existing currently which supports this amount of immigration.......
@realDonaldTrump @FoxNews ...... I haven't, personally, witnessed this (if I do or had it would have been reported to the authority) but the rumor mill has been consistent concerning this type of behavior is being participated in by numerous persons who have recently entered the US........
@realDonaldTrump @FoxNews Mr. President, concerning this subject, what I can assure you is I have personally heard of and believe that this problems is more prevalent than may be considered. I have heard of immigrants, in my neighborhood who are having improper contact with adolescents...........

@GovLarryHogan Thank you, governor. I emailed Jen Corbin yesterday to let her know I am spending all weekend preparing a proposal outlining an answer, in partnership with Anne Arundel County's Safe Station initiative address the opiate crisis in a way no one has thought

@ChuckCallesto @happyfinko F the "wall" if there is no country to protect
@FOXBaltimore ... That has to stop. The wall isn't going to be a deterrent. The government and the people "at the top" allow the drugs to come into the country. They confiscate a certain amount, declaring " the war is working", only to allow the large portion to successfully be smuggled in.
@FOXBaltimore Let me say this, how can the sheriff make a statement so sweeping as if a wall would stop the supply. As long as there is a demand, a supply will appear. America has to stop being a "feel good" country. It has been this way forever. An insatiable appetite for drugs.....

@funder A clever plan to divert attention from the real problem: election collusion in order to get Trump in the door in Russia with his "Tower". You know this is all starting to smell and not good.
@funder Things are about to get real. I was waiting for this because, no matter what, if the President broke the law, he must pay the price. This whole Russian collusion thing seems to have been, sort of, side tracked because of this "shut down" crap. Could this all been a clever plan?
@EdKrassen I don't know where this is going but it is dangerous for the democracy for a politician to mess with the way the process SHOULD take place, not for their agenda.
She was paid? Oh, real honesty. https://t.co/qovZUpvrjK
@funder He did say it. Why does he take his foot out of his ass to stick it in his mouth, every time?
@amyklobuchar That is bull crap and shouldn't be tolerated. The possible AG should more than happy to meet with you, if not maybe is isn't going to be forthcoming with his responses to your inquiries.
@BetGranger @vivartist14 @cher Is there leadership in the Senate and Congress? They always look confused, to me. Pelosi and Shummer. Sounds like a car dealership.
@LexisNexisRisk What do insurers have to do with it. That statement turns me off. Why can't your business stand on it's own two feet?
@charliekirk11 Go figure.
@MAPermanente I don't trust doctors anymore. They have lost their ability to follow their oath and are in bed with the pharmaceutical companies.
@ABC Should be shoots, sorry. Look, I am an independent and wouldn't have voted for him had I had my voter's card. I wouldn't have voted for Hilary, either. I changed my affiliation after this election to independent because I want to vote for the best candidate available.
@ABC The only comment that I care to mention concerning this is, Mr. Trump seems very down to earth. He doesn't seem to be politicized like most Presidents have seemed. Yes, maybe he shots from the hip and isn't "scripted". To me, it's refreshing.
@JanisOl07095228 Thank you. There has been a mixture of trials and blessings. I am grateful for the blessings and fight through the trials.
@RealJamesWoods @LarryJo96060426 James, you are so funny. A birth of a nation, Huh. LOL.
@MSNBC US needs to intervene in these countries being taken over by autocratic dictators. Immediate action is required. A regime change. All the Civil Rights agencies on the planet need to unite to stop this practice once and for all and show these guys that we will not tolerate it.
@TheRynheart I don't care for Chuckie.
@Zdravo_Kosti Thanks, good looking
Got to go!!!!! Hungry. Be back in a bit.
Pray for me as I did for you when I heard about the cancer. You are a wonderful man. Never change.
I remain homeless when I had paid this man rent for a period of three years never being late and never being short. He even knows my family. This is an injustice to say the least. I had to be hospitalized during this time period for heart problems, probably from the stress.
The victims remain victims and the criminals are rewarded, so it seems, for their felonious acts. My case is a prime example. All my worldly (And I didn't have a lot, mostly memories and important papers) belongings were thrown away by him. I have been fighting this since Oct. 1
.... threw my case out (Theft between 1,500 and $25,000, a felony) and proceeded to believe him that I, 5'6" 140 pounds and he 6'2" 250 pounds) assaulted him. It is totally fabricated but it seems that, like you said, our judicial system in the city is broke.
....illegally evicted me. He is a millionaire and I honestly don't understand why he would want to do such a thing. I have known him and worked for him over a 25 year period. Not full time but pretty consistently. The Baltimore City District Attorney at Wabash actually....
Sir, I have been physically assaulted two months in a row and robbed of material things and cash ($350). I am a 60 year old man who has turned his life around and who recently lost his wife of 12 years on July 1st, 2018. On October 1st, 2018, my landlord of 3 years......
I wanted to thank you, I heard you on WBAL radio this morning, for your decisiveness and your great leadership. You are truly an inspiration and anyone, I mean anyone, should be honored if they were spoken of in the same sentence as you are concerning integrity. Thank you.
@James_au_1972 @justbeckylee @realDonaldTrump @Twitter OMG, The Sudan, I believe, is considered by America to be a terrorist country. I am almost sure. Please be safe. I really don't know much about your law enforcement or judicial system but I hope there are leaders there for you. I will pray for Australia.
@MeUncensured @JeffreyGuterman @realDonaldTrump You are giving him too much credit Thorny.
@shellybeads @JeffreyGuterman @realDonaldTrump Deviated septum would be my diagnosis.
@LoriDTindall @JeffreyGuterman @realDonaldTrump I am not insinuating that you don't know about the Harrison Act I am only supporting you about the obvious "Under the Influence" signs that people show. Sort of like "body language". Like Clinton said, "I didn't inhale", but she (Monica) did!!!!!!!!
@LoriDTindall @JeffreyGuterman @realDonaldTrump There is now a state that is going to have a ballot asking voters to vote "YEA" to legalizing hallucinogenic mushrooms. This drug legalization thing is getting out of control. The Harrison Act was passed way back when for particular reasons that, if you don't know, were valid.
@JeffreyGuterman @realDonaldTrump @Nesingletary @JeffreyGuterman Wow, Jefferey, get real, Dude!!!!!!
@timrote @realDonaldTrump Hold on, let me make sure my Wizanator is in place and functioning. You know I like to cheat and lie a little bit. You don't mind, do you? I am THE PRESIDENT DAMMIT.
@James_au_1972 @justbeckylee @realDonaldTrump @Twitter James, how are you doing and I hope you and your family had an enjoyable and safe holiday season there in Australia. I have always been captivated by the uniqueness of your country. You never hear anything negative concerning Aussie's and the country. You should be proud.
@justbeckylee @realDonaldTrump @Twitter One speech does not make a presidency. You are correct. I only said his behavior and approach was more focused, noting more.
@JeffreyGuterman @realDonaldTrump Well, with a supply, he could be a pretty good customer, HUH???????
@DeepStateExpose @realDonaldTrump LOL
@Zorro3 @realDonaldTrump You think!!!!!!??????!!!!!?????!!!!!!!!
@jreckless82 @JarvisGoogoo @realDonaldTrump ... Commissioners in the Governor's short 4 year term. Four or five. That is insane. The mayor can't get anything done or maybe she is trying to divert attention away from her legacy. A legacy of nothing. Look, with a legacy like that, you will be forgotten pretty quickly.
@jreckless82 @JarvisGoogoo @realDonaldTrump ... Disabled, Woman. They know who to target. The governor, just last night, informed the great citizens of Maryland, things aren't very merry for me!!!! , he is forming a Violent Crime Task Force which will be operated out of Baltimore City. There have been 4 or 5 police...
@jreckless82 @JarvisGoogoo @realDonaldTrump ... READY FOR THE DRUMROLL? Snake-eyes!!!!!!! Good ole Baltimore, Maryland. The Land of Pleasant Living or should I say The Land of Pleasant Killing? Number one violent city in America, 12th most violent in the World. Violent crime is a crisis. People are being targeted. Elderly,
@jreckless82 @JarvisGoogoo @realDonaldTrump I will stop venting because, you know, no one cares anymore. We live in a world where everyone is so self-centered, self-seeking, addicted to social media and the phones that help create the addiction, WHAT? You said addiction? Yes, it is an addiction. An obsession. I live in ...
@jreckless82 @JarvisGoogoo @realDonaldTrump ... it, not knowing who these people are and not being able to give a complete enough description of the perpetrators, I am f_____. Royally f______. I am out $350 in cash. A new radio. As a result I can't wash my clothes and some other things in my budget as a result.
@jreckless82 @JarvisGoogoo @realDonaldTrump ... maybe you shouldn't go around those areas. My contention is this, why should I be concerned for my safety in a shopping district? Where are the police? Dunkin' Donuts don't have enough donuts to tie up all the police officers in the district I shopped in. If I did report...
@jreckless82 @JarvisGoogoo @realDonaldTrump ..... to describe the behavior. Both times they took everything including the money I had in the bank (forced me to an ATM) and even though I complied with their demands I still was beat on. I have a partial fracture of my left knee. Only rest will help. You may say, well, .....
@jreckless82 @JarvisGoogoo @realDonaldTrump ..... Again, for the second month in a row, I went shopping to buy some things I needed and a few things I wanted. Both days the result of the shopping trips turned out to be disasters. I was attacked, mugged, assaulted, whatever word is being used by law enforcement.......
@jreckless82 @JarvisGoogoo @realDonaldTrump We ARE NOT SAFE. I can tell you first hand. Now, let me explain what has happened two months in a row in different areas of the city I live in. The crimes were not perpetrated by persons of Latino descent, the who is not relative. The what is relative.........
@GCasarrubias @brianLA73 @williamlegate @realDonaldTrump Especially if you don't have the right sauce!!!!!!!! LOL.
@realDonaldTrump Mr. President, I want to give you your proper acknowledgement over your "Address the Nation" TV appearance. You did a great job and that took all the sails out of the "fake media" pundits that were just waiting to pick it apart. They were left with nothing, sir.
@Durevestnik My condolences to any human being that is stripped of the basic freedoms that everyone should enjoy. My heart goes out to you. I don't feel sorry for you, I have empathy. I can't imagine being afraid to think a certain way or do certain things. It borders on slavery. Bless you.
@Zdravo_Kosti If you have any suggestions they would be appreciated. For instance, if there are sites that explain how to do thinks like, advertising strategies utilizing the web and social media sites. I want to maximize my exposure and don't want to pay for services that are unnecessary.
@BonJosh @realDonaldTrump My apologies, sincerely. Sometimes I am too defensive and that is a character defect I need to work on. Thank you for your tweet and forgive me.
@Durevestnik I honestly believe that these people are being by a spiritual sickness because the church head feels, in his spirit, that things are getting crazy. These people are afraid. Let me pose this one question and ponder on it. Do you know what country produces most phones? China?
@RealJamesWoods @PatGodlef His vocabulary is really huge, HUH. F this, F that. Duh.
@WalshFreedom @WalshFreedom Joe, come on now. You know it's normal (vomiting). Lying? These people don't lie (toking on a blunt). Security Wall? Who's getting the contracts? Better look at affiliations before rewarding them. Things are looking mighty fishy in them waters, Joe. LOL.
@NBCNews What gets me is he waits until we are nearly recessional, the stock market and NASDAQ is jumping around like a roller coaster. Philanthropists and investors are investing in TUMS and the middle class begins to look more like a caste system. HUMM.........!!!!!!!!!!?????????
@SenGillibrand @realDonaldTrump We then talk about haw much money welfare costs the taxpayers and country and when you look at the figures it amounts to 6%, WOW. You know much military spending costs the taxpayers and country? DON'T ASK. Thank you and Goodbye. Stop the darn shutdown, please. I beg of you.
@SenGillibrand @realDonaldTrump We talk about how great a leader the presidents who instituted welfare type programs like Lyndon Johnson and Franklin D. Roosevelt and then complain about the system we talk about being so great. If you had survived the Great Depression you would be eternally grateful for SNAP.
@SenGillibrand @realDonaldTrump ...who may have got benefits through some loophole. No, I am talking about people who REALLY NEED IT. It may be your mother, father, sister, brother, aunt, uncle. You want me to go on?????????????? This stuff is ridiculous and the people I have mentioned really have no say.
@SenGillibrand @realDonaldTrump It just isn't right that the left hand isn't talking to the right. How can anyone, Democrat, Republican, Independent, whatever affiliation, consider giving the unfortunate (elderly, disabled, etc.) and I am not talking about the drug addicted or alcoholic recipient...
@SenGillibrand @realDonaldTrump .... Figure this, the COLR (Cost of Living Raise) given in 2019 amounted to right around $25 for a lot of people. Now, you would think that is a good thing, NOT. When SSI went up $25 SNAP went down $10 for a net of $15. This makes no sense at all. They are both Federal programs.
@SenGillibrand @realDonaldTrump This would truly be a disaster of his making and the implications go much further when you consider the number of people who actually NEED SNAP benefits. Even those who NEED and DEPEND on SNAP, SNAP actually doesn't amount to enough to sustain a person all month.....
@EdKrassen They all knew and were a party to it.
@MoreRuckus Thank you.
@DestroRYU @realDonaldTrump WHAT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
@realDonaldTrump Mr. President, can you give me, and any others interested, examples of Walls that work. Berlin wall, GONE. Great Wall of China. INSIGNIFICANT. Walls are Walls. That is all they are. They simply provide division of areas, nothing more, nothing less. 99%? PLEASE.
... unavoidable. You pretty much have to have a presence on the various social media platforms. I also have business entities that I will be building sites for so I appreciate any suggestions concerning my lack of knowledge and the etiquette of social media. Thank you.
Thank you. I started way back when AOL was the pertinent social media communications platform and then I got a little bit into Facebook. After some obnoxious situations with other users on Facebook I decided not to partake in the social media phenomena. Now I know it is ...
@pashawas @ZoeTillman At first, I wasn't sure what you were replying to. I got it. LOL.
@BonJosh @realDonaldTrump What tweet are you responding to? I never indicated I didn't think he was the President.I am far from stupid and I am not going to go any further with this. Please don't act as if I am,
I am an IT professional and I don't agree with the act of hacking. I believe it demeans the professionals in the field, gives us a bad name. It borders on treason, depending on who you are hacking and why.
@realDonaldTrump ... obsessive behavior concerning this "Wall" thing. It is breach-able whether made out of wood, steel or titanium. What assurance do you have that this is the answer? Wouldn't a mixture of more patrolling and some type of boundary be more plausible? Just thinking..............
@realDonaldTrump Mr. President, I hope this isn't going to be a rant about how well the country is doing since you became president rhetoric. I give credit where credit is due but can we please avoid he ego maniac crap, PLEASE. I hope the issues that you raise tonight will explain your almost...
@hinkley_brian @Steve_Ruckman @GrndKeepr_probs What?
@MoreRuckus Steve, I live in Baltimore and need any info you may have on good patent/trademark attorneys. Reputable, of course. Any direction would be appreciated. Thanks, Stan.
Just got online. I had to change my password last night because someone was logging on using my credentials and, fortunately, I got alerted and changed my password immediately. Now, today, I am trying to sign in using the new password and it says wrong password. I get frustrated.
Nice meeting you, as well.

Hi Annie, I am absolutely floored to be able to converse with one of favorite female artists. I, too, are a singer but hadn't had the breaks to sing professionally. I believe I have the voice but not the connections. Sometimes that is where life leads us. I hope you had a great..
@ZoeTillman He got his lawyer credentials either from McDonald's or Walmart. I am not sure which but they are very prominent. He is certainly not taught via an Ivy League school. He wouldn't be able to attack a judge, in their court, claiming bias. He is committing professional suicide.
@Karoli What in the heck do you mean that he (HE, HE, HE) is offering steel? He can't offer anything. He doesn't have the power to offer anything. That is simply feeding into the delusional thought process of a man plunging into a straight jacket. Get ready. Luckily he can't launch bombs
@thehill .... consider appropriate measures to stop this man's plunging into madness. The pressure is too much for him. His ego is "Easing God Out". This country was founded on principles and he doesn't have any. Seriously, I could do a better job.
@thehill Yea, steal the money!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! This becomes more ridiculous the longer we allow him to have time to think of more insane ideas. He is really delusional. This thinking is in no way logical. The Congress and Senate really need to look closely at this presidency and...
Trump pushing for steel barrier instead of concrete wall at border https://t.co/dZYUb0g3GD	This is even more insane.
@BonJosh @realDonaldTrump He is a president?
@realDonaldTrump Sir you are the one tweeting in all capitals like you are ranting or is it because you had a couple two many or four many or six many? You need to calm down and focus on the problems of this country and forget about the fake news and haters. Is your self esteem that low, sir?
@Willcsmithjr @DelegateSanchez Great idea, the children should not suffer because of the political rhetoric being thrown around like they are at a slumber party. They are at a slumber party. One of their own making. Grow up.
@realDonaldTrump Mr. President stop the nonsense. Do you have some secret agenda concerning this "wall" thing. Are your friends going to benefit from the awarding of some very large contracts? Something is amiss, sir. You are obsessed with this thing. Go to your therapist and reveal what it is.
@realDonaldTrump Shutdown the shutdown and be bipartisan and come to some kind of agreeable way to deal with our immigration problems.
@realDonaldTrump Furthermore, you promised that Mexico would help in the financing of the wall and apparently that wasn't true. As president, the truth must be adhered to because everything comes out in the wash and your wash is looking pretty dirty.
@realDonaldTrump I was all for the wall until, looking at it REALISTICALLY (Yes it is in capitals, Mr. President), it can be breached below and above making it impractical. Now, a 5 billion dollar impractical wall isn't prudent. It would be better served by putting more people to work in vehicles
@incCEOProject I hope new school, guide me.
@SenBillFerg @GovLarryHogan @AntonioHayes40 @MayorPugh50 @docbullock @KeifferMitchell @BoydKRutherford @DelegateHaynes I have great ideas and I believe they are based in reality and I am able to monitor these initiatives given the chance. My greatest blessing to you and your family Mr. Hogan. Sincerely Yours, Mr. Stan Orner.
@SenBillFerg @GovLarryHogan @AntonioHayes40 @MayorPugh50 @docbullock @KeifferMitchell @BoydKRutherford @DelegateHaynes My email address is stancornerjr@gmail. I look forward to conversing with anyone who believes in my initiative. I hope to begin the process of making Baltimore a viable place for families to settle. Crimes have to be addressed. Mental Health/Substance Abuse have to be addressed.
@SenBillFerg @GovLarryHogan @AntonioHayes40 @MayorPugh50 @docbullock @KeifferMitchell @BoydKRutherford @DelegateHaynes I know people, like yourself and those involved in the initiative want quantum plans not some "fly by night" plan which you would never be able to monitor because they are only ideas. I have plans.
@SenBillFerg @GovLarryHogan @AntonioHayes40 @MayorPugh50 @docbullock @KeifferMitchell @BoydKRutherford @DelegateHaynes Great work Mr. Hogan. I am interested in a piece of property in an Opportunity Zone that has been abandoned for 30 years. I want to the owner and rehab this special home using Green initiatives. I am going through a lot of research and architectural plans to bring forth.
happy I meant not heppiness. Sorry I made a BooBoo. Everyone's heart, soul and spirit should feel for these unfortunate. people. I am sure that the investigation is going on as we sand if anyone is negligent they should by with their life. This is much more than an accident.
⚡️ “Five children headed to Disney World among seven killed in Florida car crash”		https://t.co/PtILEPqSER This is absolutely a dreadful example of the sadness of lives being taken before their time. They were almost assuredly looking forward to the trip and resultant heppiness.
@realDonaldTrump @kilun54 Quit acting as if you are the most important person on earth. Stop the shutdown. Do the right thing for the right reason, Mr. Trump. Quit tweeting and start commanding the presidency.
@realDonaldTrump @kilun54 Hey, Mr. Trump. Why don't you stop the shutdown. You made your point OK. Now you are negatively impacting some vital services and it has to stop. If you allow this to fester your re-election plans, if you have any or if you make it to another election, are null and void.
Today I went to the supposed corporate store with no remedy. As a result I had to file a follow up complaint with the FCC when I noticed on their web site that they are going to cease operation tomorrow as a result of the shutdown. See what affect this is having?
I am having a problem restoring my phone service with MetroPCS after I was mugged 4 months ago. I am still without service. I received a certified letter from Metro recently (In November) indicating how they were going to rectify situation.

@rpaulsenphoto @funder @AudreySAutrey You know, when our judicial system has spiraled into an institution where you are afraid to bring the truth to them it is time to dismantle the agency and start over. It has gotten to be systemic and the minute law cannot be enforced is the minute America has become an autocracy.

@MDSP .... enough is enough. As I sat inside I heard the bombs bursting in air at 12 o'clock, or should I say the bullets flying in air! Well, you get the jest. Thank you Mayor Pugh, thank you Mr. Fitzgerald for all the work you have done in making Baltimore safe (sic).
@MDSP Well, I decided to go in the house early New Years eve because of a couple of reasons: 1. Baltimore is the 2nd violent city in America, 2. It is the 12th most violent in the World, 3. We topped 300 homicides again, 4. I have been the victim of violent crime 4x in 4 months....
@JamesJumper @realDonaldTrump I am, in no way, taking up for Trump but the economic slowdown started with Obama. Thank him. Your are correct that we need to concentrate on the infrastructure. The Wall is breach-able, no matter how they build it. The drugs and illegal immigrants are going to continue.
@realDonaldTrump Happy New Year to you and your family, sir. Good job. Keep it up.

@DogginTrump Is your vocabulary that small that you have to use the F word? Just wondering.
@Johnny_Pigeon @nspector4 @strombo I, an American, don't understand why anyone in any country would try to disseminate what is going on in a country (Canada) that you don't live in. I have never heard much bad about Canada, not that there isn't bad, and only those people Canadian have any right to argue about it.
@nspector4 He may not be a traitor but he was communist and that isn't a good thing, Mr. Spector.
@CNNPolitics CNN bullshit, again.
@funder Let's hope so, anything less will be criminal.
@realDonaldTrump The wall can be breached over, with many devices, and under with tunnels. What are we going to accomplish with it?
@EdKrassen @LindseyGrahamSC Mrs. Trump isn't Secretary of State or running for the next President of the United States, either.
@NPR This will be interesting
@CrowdExposure @gofundme @ViralExpNotify What happened to Justin.
@AP Mrs. Warren. If you mean what you say, and it will take a lot of convincing that you politicos aren't just blowing smoke up our arses, then I will be impressed and may very well vote for you. At least you would be better than a man, your fellow Democrat, not black Mr. Obama.
@marcorubio Marco what are you trying to say. It sounds as if you are talking in tongues or babbling.
@YahooSports @MikeyThomasMMA That's insane.
@Comey Comey, go back to jail you treasonous joke of an American. Who would trust you now? You don't have a say in life and who cares what you have to say. You couldn't tell the truth if you tried.
@joncoopertweets Mr. Biden because he has the experience at the Executive level and he is a man of principles.
@RealSaavedra CNN is a joke. They are witches. This a nation of free speech, sorry. Don't you have better things to report on? Like the injustices being done in Egypt and the Sudan?
@fred_guttenberg There is nothing, and I mean nothing, joking about innocent children getting tore up by a psychopaths bullets. He should hope that someone doesn't beat the living crap out of him leaving the arena, theater, where ever he is blowing off at the mouth from. Pompous ass.

@realDonaldTrump People are dying daily in Baltimore, more than one from drug overdoses and the politicians and law enforcement doesn't do a thing. We have cartel members buying up every business possible and nobody does anything. Build the f___ing wall and deport these leeches.
@siano2020 So what? Does that make him superman? At least he can read!!!! At least he isn't beating his wife.
@realDonaldTrump CNN, pasting impeachment all over the news yesterday made me lose any and all respect I had for that news agency. It enforced in me what you have been saying all along. Fake news, Democrat backed, communist bunch of crap. You tell it like it is and they don't like it.
@Google Google shutting down Google+ is a travesty.
@realDonaldTrump Donald, They are out getting drunk. There is no way you are going to encourage these drunkards to help you on Hew Years. They don't care when it is a regular day no less a drunkard day!!!!!!!
@JudgeJeanine Yes I am on top of this issue as I am with most. I am very outspoken, like you, and I don't tolerate any nonsense.
@GOCIMD My email is stancornerjr@gmail.com. Sincerely yours, Stan Orner.
@GOCIMD I am interested in the availability of funding for those first time home owners who want to go "Green" but are unsure of what is available or how to go about securing funds. I am so proud to have Mr. Hogan as our governor. He is a great man. Thank you for information.
@GOCIMD I have just secured a home after being illegally evicted October 1st. My day in court is on January 29th concerning the eviction but subsequently, through God's grace, was able to get a home recently. I am looking to go "Green" when rehabbing house.
Wow, you are a musician? I have a really good voice. I sang in a band for 9 years and was a Concert Choir member in school. You had to be invited to be in the Choir. We made an album 50 years ago. I wish I still had it.
Are you related to Warren, by chance? I have always yearned to get into the ministry. I love God and Jesus and they have done some remarkable things in my life. I am sorry about the reference to sports. I mistake you, at first, for Warren Sapp. Sapp is a unique name. My apology.
@JackPosobiec Her death kind of reminds me of that Russian journalist who was poisoned with radiation. At first everyone thought he had some natural malady but at the end every realized he was ;poisoned by the KGB or one of Putin's minions. This is eerily similar.
@dezzyluvsya I am sorry if I took my frustration out on you because that wasn't fair. I wasn't treated fair by the staff there, either. Not you. Others. That place is very sick. It isn't conducive to recovery, at all. It is a plague. A sickness and I blame it on the admin.
@dezzyluvsya I take none of the credit for my success. It is what you did for me and the suggestions you made and the venting you allowed that has gotten me to this threshold. All the glory goes to you. You are a great counselor. A lot of things were out of your hands there.
I don't know why I haven't looked for you before now. Did you get your card? I miss you. I am doing well, Bought a house and a car. Court is January 29 with you know who. I hope work is going better because when I left you were really bummed out. I earn another take home in Jan.
@realDonaldTrump @Anderso64620783 Keep it up Mr. Trump. Stand behind what you say. I know you do but I figured I'd give you some backing. God knows you could use it.
@TravisAllen02 It's just like a little kid's hand in the cookie jar. They will eat the cookies until they are gone, well if we give these spoiled people (brats if you will) the key to the bank what do you think they are going to do? We need to get our head out of the sand and take a stand.
@TravisAllen02 And let the politicians know that this kind of spending is unacceptable. The tax payers ultimately pay for the politician's luxurious lifestyle. no one else. And we allow it so who is at fault? Them? They are going to spend it if we allow it.
@TravisAllen02 When the out of control spending is curtailed, and it isn't just Trump, then the US may be able to get out of debt. Just think of all the Federal Level politicians and then think of their unmitigated spending on frivolities. Makes your head spin. We the people need to filibuster
@Zeke_Cohen Thank you Zeke. I didn't know whether I had, that is thanked you. You and your family are in my thoughts and prayer, as well. I pray for peace and that people will begin to love one another and care for one another as was commanded. It isn't hard, just try. It is all I ask.
@CNN I need to redress my post. There may be things more valuable then a father's love for his daughter. I was just saying "in a matter of speaking". I get attacked so much for a simple post that I will now be very aware of what and how I am posting comments. This is insane.
@KCEEAICH @krassenstein Why do I have to be hit with this complete bull crap first thing when I first get on the internet. Do you intentionally sit around waiting for someone to attack and if you do go back to bed and get up on the other side of it and leave me alone. I don't have to justify anything.
@denisebatters @happyfinko Senator, please correct these people, I was going to call them idiots but that wouldn't be nice or christian of me. I am getting so agitated at the banter instead of people looking critically at the FACTS. Make the people who are committing these crimes accountable.
Concerning NBCs take on Trump's Iraq visit: This is getting asinine. It in't the responsibility of the President to inform ANY news agency about his intentions. Get real NBC. You just want to nit pick Trump. Leave the man alone for God's sake. He went.
@marklutchman @Castle_wow Amen
@EdKrassen @seanhannity Czech	Czech	Czech	Czech	Czech		Hang	Hang	Hang	Hang	Hang		Treason	Treason	Treason	Treason	Treason
@WalshFreedom He Joe, where are you going with that gun in your hand? Just kidding, I love your music and have from The James Gang and I appreciate you as a person and a musical genius. I am proud to even be able to converse with you. Sincerely Yours, Stan O.
@funder @MichaelCohen212 Scott, he is a liar. You can't change the speckles on the animal. He has been there and is in bed with the communists. I wish the Congress would convene an inquiry (commission) to investigate these guys, including Trump. Put them on the hot set, in public.
@CNN That is beautiful. There is nothing more valuable then a father's love for his daughter, or so it should be.
@kylegriffin1 F CNN
@krassenstein @KCEEAICH What is wrong with the Secretary of State referring to the rapture. Oh, I forgot, separation of church and state. That is probably what is wrong, morally, with America today. All this craziness started when the prayer and pledge of allegiance was taken out of schools.
@AbbyIsaacsNews @HoCoGovExec @WMAR2News That is wonderful news. Let's preserve what we have. That is the problem in America. When something devastating happens, like the flooding in Ellicott City, the answer is rebuilding. The only people that benefits are the wealthy. Congrats Howard County government.
Thank you for your continued efforts to reduce America's dependence on opiods.
@tictoc Great.
@realDonaldTrump Mr. Trump, don't let these people keep bothering you. You have nothing to explain to nobody. You are the president, I just wish you would be a little more humble. Good job.
@funder There you go. I was told by a gentleman on the bus two days ago that he, being in the know (he is a heroin addict), can promise me that the Dossier was lies. I beg to differ. All that money wasn't spent to just make up lies. There is a lot of truth to it, right Hilary?
@terryrush33 @AP When China adopts free enterprise then the US will have an even playing field. We have created the Chinese monster, nobody else. Trump wasn't in office when our previous "leaders (sic)" borrowed, uncontrollably, from China. Thank them.
@DJBurn77 @AP The insanity that is perpetrating through the "what if" crowd is insatiable. I am waiting to see Chitty Chitty Bang Bang delivering Christmas presents instead of Santa Claus and Rudolf.
@crackthemessage @AP @DrDinD @MelissaJPeltier @Jodi______ Trump isn't that powerful to control the stock market. Please don't initiate another Trump conspiracy theory. Next you will say Illuminati is behind it. The all knowing eye. I am expecting Bella Lugosi or Boris Karloff to begin tweeting any minute.
@FreddyYellin @AP @realDonaldTrump That is sick.
@AP Free enterprise is alive and well. In the advent of the new economy, Sears going out of business and so many successful internet businesses; Amazon, Ebay. We probably need to re-evaluate how we view the economy and the whys of the recent stock market roller coaster.
@tannerstake @happyfinko Since Mrs. Obama was abused I believe she may deserve recognition for putting up with such a swine.
@K69atie @happyfinko It is beautiful and donated.
@charliekirk11 @HuffPost Charlie, that is an interesting fact. I would have to wonder whether Federal employees are as productive as lay people. People who work for regular businesses get raises based on their performance not "just because". Maybe we have a problem there. We need to insist on an audit.
@TIME He makes me sick.
@tictoc I don't want anything to happen to the reindeer. All animals are so innocent and beautiful. I wanted to be a veterinarian when I was young but was discouraged by the vet that I was interning with. My love still lay with animals. Dr. Doolittle was one of my favorite movies.
@tictoc He doesn't impress me at all and I wouldn't associate with him if you paid me to. He is trivial at best.
@tictoc You know what bothers me with these rich, tycoon types? They come and go into issues like they change underwear. A person with integrity stands behind the issues they believe in like Mr. Gates. If he at anytime associated with Mr. Bannon and/or Mr. Trump he is simply a hanger-on.
@eyeonannapolis @Steuart_Pittman Thank you for your input.
@realDonaldTrump @DHSgov Mr. Trump, Thank You and your administration for this very significant policy and you have included in the policy accountability which is so important in legislative matters, especially this one. You did an exceedingly great job on this bill and thank you, sir and all involved.
@RedPillBlackMan @_AstroAmerican @realDonaldTrump Very good point.
@ROHLL5 @_AstroAmerican Pretty insane, isn't it?
@_AstroAmerican To all you NRA enthusiasts, you pay the bills of the people randomly shot in this country and pay the families of the people innocently killed by gun violence around this country and then I'll support your lobbying. Until then, keep your head down, you may hear a ricochet.
@_AstroAmerican We are kidding ourselves to think that anyone in this country who isn't in the military or who has some type of job in the enforcement of law and order needs a gun, for what. Oh, I forgot, hunting. That was not the original intention of the Constitution, to allow hunters weapons.
@_AstroAmerican We cannot get anyone to responsibly own guns and keep them secured at their home. That is why there has been so many school shootings. We don't have the proper and complete application process in place to assure those who want to acquire guns can responsibly own them.
@_AstroAmerican Britain hasn't needed police to carry guns for centuries. Centuries. Now, one of the founding countries of this country doesn't require their police to carry automatic weapons but the USA believes it is a requirement for the populace to have guns. It is insanity.
@_AstroAmerican All other countries, France, Britain, Spain, they all wanted a piece of this great country and some of them did get a piece. We had to be able to bear arms. Get real. We now have branches of service called the military that do need guns to protect the liberties of Americans.
@_AstroAmerican The reason the amendment concerning guns even exists is due to the environment present when the Declaration of Independence was written. Ah, I believe in 1776? Well, back then we were at war with everyone. Creating a new country can be dangerous.
@_AstroAmerican I am going to go out on a limb and say what I feel. Guns have no purpose in a civilized society. And I am going to get the pundits saying, "Well, this isn't a civilized society anymore. Crime is out of control.". Anything to support the stance to have guns.
@NaomiMartin @_AstroAmerican What a farce. Never allow him to act in a movie ever again. Take away his fortune. He doesn't deserve nothing but the inside of an 8 by 10 jail cell with Bubba watching him as he drops the soap. Woops. I am disgusted.
@realDonaldTrump @happyfinko Mr. Trump, it is done sir. The Wall has been approved by the House and Senate. Congratulations.
@Imamofpeace @happyfinko A woman is a woman and no woman can "make" a man feel like a woman. That is absurd. If a man becomes homosexual it is probably because he wants to be homosexual. I can't believe any man would enjoy being treated like a woman. Where do people get this insane thinking?
@JPenaMelnyk @RobbynLewis46th Please, to anyone who is feeling done this holiday season and especially if you are feeling suicidal, know that God and Jesus loves you and are here for you. It is never as bleak as it seems. I have been there. I lost my wife on July 1st but I keep my head held high.
@washingtonpost Here we go with more intelligence about election tampering. The new fraud.
@TIME Amazing with great resolve.
@tictoc They need to lose more, as a matter of fact they need to give it to the unfortunate and the downtrodden. God made Solomon do it, so let's get on God's bandwagon and demand these rich people to give back to the very people who assisted them in getting wealthy.
@lukebroadwater @TaliRichman Who is making these absurd decisions? Don't we have writing on bus stop benches that says or used to say: Baltimore, The City That Reads? or am I crazy?
Mr. Richard is not worth my effort.
@funder Wow, this is amazing. The deception.
@musicologyman @AP No, you are a cop-out. You can't upset me, I go with my heart and he is being vilified by everyone. He is only human with the trappings of self will. You, of course, could never run a country. You are too quick to jump on the bandwagon of judgement. Have a good day, Richard.
@eyeonannapolis @Steuart_Pittman What do you believe is going to be the result of this, just asking your take?
@brianrahmer @RobbynLewis46th Absolutely. It tears at the fabric of our society and is one of the major reasons the American family has been torn apart. We don't resemble the country we were 50 years ago. We have gotten to be frighteningly close to Sodom and Gomorrah. Sorry.
@raylewis @CanesFootball @PinstripeBowl You got it Ray. Thanks for your wonderful service to the Ravens and the community. You are an inspiration.
@CMEActiveTrader Trying to secure funding in a city that was once proud but whose politicians has allowed it to decay to unheard off levels. Many homes can be acquired for nearly nothing, having been left abandoned. A lot of proud neighborhoods with rich history stand dilapidated
@AP It is so easy to jump to conclusions as to the what or why but to be honest and true we must except that God called for the boy, for whatever reason, and it isn't for mankind to determine why.
@realDonaldTrump Donald, not everyone wants to persecute you, including me. I have carefully considered the things I have been saying to you and it wasn't done with a Christian heart. My apologies, sir. https://t.co/N2mvVkPxkm
@Zeke_Cohen Thank you, I lost my wife July 1st. All I have left is my cat. My wonderful landlord illegally evicted me Oct. 1st so I am trying my best to enjoy these Holidays. I have my moments. My family is in Baltimore but for some reason has gotten fractured. I don't understand any of it.
@Zeke_Cohen Thank you so much. What a beautiful family. You are blessed. I lost my wife of 12 years on July 1st under very suspicious circumstances so the holidays are hard this year. With God I know I will bet through these hardships. With prayer comes relief.
@SaraCarterDC OMG
You know what, If you all want to participate in the insanity of his thought process, do so, but leave me out. You don't have to retweet it to me as an emphasis. If that is how you believe I will tolerate this whole social media phenomena blocking you is also easy.
@Deiscirt @rcallimachi Probably mis-informed. Not in denial. Same too ya. Back at ya. LOL.
@prosynctus @Deiscirt Second that.
@Slash Same to you, my man.
@ItsMyView @KimKovarik1941 @DearAuntCrabby I like that. Having an open-mind is the only way to enlightenment.
@BadgerIrishScot @KimKovarik1941 @DearAuntCrabby Amen
@tictoc @pressfreedom I don't mean to downplay the significance of these journalists being jailed but we are talking about Turkey. They have a disastrous reputation in regards to civil rights. There isn't a good solution to reporting what occurs in THAT country.
@MissNyetTrump You are funny. I would wrap them and send them back to who sent them to you, maybe Comey? Please try to have an enjoyable Holiday Season. This country is not nice and will try to destroy you just to do so. Hold your head high because your husband is a great man.
@C_3C_3 @cooke_april This conspiracy stuff is getting old. Sorry.
@ChuckCallesto @cooke_april Just stop.
@DelMaggie43 And?
@WSJ That is sad for Sears but inevitable with Amazon, Walmart and the change is consumerism.
@psychdr100 The signs are in place indicating recession is on the way and Mr. Trump is not responsible, Sorry.
@realDonaldTrump Very good, sir.
@Tweets4DJT @cooke_april This hurts me to my heart. I would love to care for this and all the various animals that aren't cared for.
@psychdr100 If it is a parody then male sure you state so. People will actually believe you are reporting reputable news. That is how unsteady our populace is, so please stop leading them on.
@psychdr100 It certainly isn't reality. This is the problem that Mr Trump alludes to. This kind of quack reporting only exacerbates an already serious media problem they are creating themselves. There is no way Mr. Trump ever said anything close to what the Onion is purposing. Get real.
@realDonaldTrump It is time these nations stand on their own two feet.
@realDonaldTrump It is amazing what happens when the good ole US of A pulls out of these ridiculous problems. Every nation thinks we will just come running to their aide. They actually expect it. Thank you for making a stand in both Syria and especially Afghanistan.
@realDonaldTrump They need to keep their promises to support you in the bi-partisan way that we all wish the government would act towards each other. This constant in-fighting between the parties is just not necessary. It is crazy, sir.
@realDonaldTrump Yes, they aren't considering all the reason to do so. Why would we, as a nation, leave a wall partially built, anyway? Would you partially build your house? Only to find that you have nowhere to take a dump? Maybe that is what the Democrats are doing to you. Dumping on you.
@AmirSariaslan People are taking, for granted, the ability to get student loans and the need to repay the loans when banks are so nice to lend. The obligation to repay is of the utmost importance. These type of people are going to ruin our ability to get student loans, in the future.
@AmirSariaslan What is sad is I actually love education and believe, in my heart, that it is one of the most important decisions you will make in life. What is disappointing is how many people who are apparently taking it for granted as evidenced by the number of defaulted loans.
@Castle_wow Thank you. May you and your family have a wonderful, safe holiday season.
You know, they resigned and you didn't force them to do so. They made their own bed. It may have been better if they had decided to stay in office and fight the good fight, with you, if they didn't agree with you. They copped out, not you..
@Deiscirt @prosynctus @rcallimachi Do we have a policy? LOL. Have a great holiday season. You know, sometimes we just have to lighten up. In order to enjoy life I have to give myself time to look at the parody of situations and laugh. Everything just isn't that important. I have to remind myself of this.
@DonaldJTrumpJr @realDonaldTrump I apologized to him and I do so to your family, as well. He has the hardest job on this planet and felt that he could make a difference and, I believe when all is said and done, he will be known as a man who stood on principles. May your family have a wonderful Holiday Season.
@DonaldJTrumpJr @realDonaldTrump Yes sir, I will agree with you that, if your father is being treated in this way by a misguided news industry, then shame on them and may they receive the same judgement that they are using to gauge your father's performance. I must say I have been too harsh on him.
@Deiscirt @rcallimachi I agree about ISIS being replaced by another radical group but I stand firm in my disbelief in your belief that Islamism is the cause of, as you say "The swamp from which these diseases arise". Quote, Unquote.
@realDonaldTrump You know as well as I know that every decision you make is the result of a lot of different opinions, that you take into consideration, when arriving when you decide to act. I appreciate your candidness and your unwavering beliefs.
@realDonaldTrump So, if you would sir, accept my apology and let me encourage you to continue to allow your administration to guide your decisions and please stop acting as if everything that occurs, both bad and good, as a result of your decisions only can rest in your decision making.
@realDonaldTrump Mr. Trump, I must apologize concerning my demeaning you concerning some of the decisions that have been made concerning some issues. I can't say that I have the ability to empathize with you because these decisions are monumental and affect so many people in the world.
@PehlaSuraj @Deiscirt @rcallimachi I am just indicating that, from what I understand about the religion, I don't think that any rational person would condone beheading non-Islamic people in general. To me that is going too far. I am sorry if my perception is incorrect.
@PehlaSuraj @Deiscirt @rcallimachi Honestly, not being Islamic, I can't intelligently discuss the issues that plagues the religion. Although I have studied the Koran some, I am no expert, I must say that with the level of knowledge I have, I am in no way, qualified to entertain a in depth discussion about it.
I am sure your secret talks with Vladimir are going well. He must be very proud of you carrying out his plans to destabilize America by using the President of the United States as a poster boy for communism. Good job Donald, Oh boy. By the way, have you had your STD tests done?
You are working hard at destroying this country. Now you have two of the most important people responsible for the stabilization of Syria and they are leaving their positions because they just can't take any more of your crap. Are you satisfied?
@annahcav @rcallimachi I agree, I think we all can imagine the brutality of the behavior. We don't need to see it.
@Deiscirt @rcallimachi The problem is radical Islamism. Islam, as a religious following, is not violent. The jihadists twist the religion just like all other hate groups to support their own crazy views. ISIS is a plague on the world. The world should unite and eradicate anyone who claims allegiance.
@CouncilmanETC @RecNParks Eric, you are the bomb!!!!!
@CouncilmanETC @RecNParks @BmoreCityDOT @SenBillFerg @LukeClippinger @BELBaltimore @RobbynLewis46th @FedHillPark_SHR @MdHistTrust @BaltimoreDPW Thanks for your concern and immediate response. We have had so much rain, saturating the ground that it is inevitable that these weak spots are going to be uncovered. At least we can address it and shore it up for the future. I actually was expecting to see Noah. LOL.
It looks like Trump lied again hoping nobody would remember way back then, his promises to the American public. He is a blatant liar and manipulator. A master of deception. Derelict in duty. Impeach him.
Well, I haven't heard a darn thing about Mexico paying for the wall or even contributing to the wall. Instead, they actually supported the immigrants march towards the United States even providing a resting place in Mexico City supplying food and shelter.
I am not saying that the wall shouldn't be built but I want to go back to the comment Trump made when this all started and I believe we need to hold him accountable. He said, almost a direct quote; "Mexico will pay for the wall when all is said and done".
Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) is patting Trump on the back for his rigid stance on his border wall. https://t.co/p7v0QcSDQj via @HuffPostPol
I understand the why of Clinton, but eventually, it became criminal and allowed a man, who should have never been elected, running this country and making absurd decisions causing the world to look at the US as a clown almost rogue. Please end this stuff.
A lot of this conduct borders on treason which carries the death penalty. This kind of conduct by people enlisted with the trust of the American people to make good, sound, morally guided decisions.
The Steele Dossier and the perils of political insurance policies https://t.co/HtDrnDgUzq 	I encourage, no I insist that everyone complicit in this cover-up be exposed and prosecuted to the full extent of the law.
@tictoc It just goes to show you how great technological breakthroughs can be ruined by "the apple that spoiled the whole bunch" scenario. Drones have allowed a whole new level of anonymous terrorism. I have heard that drones are capable of transporting nuclear arms and delivering them.
@psychdr100 For Vice President Pence to trust his boss on anything is a big mistake. Mr. Trump has no loyalty to anyone. He is an egomaniac with an inferiority complex. Psychotic. I tell you, if our House and Senate doesn't impeach him, we need to review all our elected officials.
@realDonaldTrump I hope you, and only you, choke on it.
@WSJ ....radioactive substances probably put in the journalists food by some undercover operative from the KGB. Sounds like a fictional, made up synopsis, doesn't it. Guess what? Fiction can only come from non-fictional situations, ask anybody in Hollywood.
@WSJ The other smell you may recognize is the smell of burning flesh when the bomb is dropped by a rogue nation on Washington DC. It may seem far fetched but you better wake up, he is in bed with Putin and that is a dangerous, callous, insidious man. He has killed journalists with....
@WSJ Impeach him, immediately and then dismantle his cronies he has installed in all the major positions in government from Secretary of State to the various embassies in the world that represent America. I am telling you all to wake up and smell the roses before you smell the sh_t.
@WSJ ....have the ability to shut the government down, over a temper tantrum. I believe that falls under the government of dictatorship. Maybe I am crazy. This man is an autocrat, plain and simple. He is dangerous, see Venezuela or The Philippines as examples of autocracies.
@WSJ What amazes me is that congress and all our representatives, democrats and republican alike, allow this nutcase to dictate our government that is supposed to be "By the people, for the people". Now, maybe I don't know my history but in a democracy, one individual should not....
@MarkBur57792010 And concerning my suggestion of Mr. Biden, he has the experience serving as Vice President, I haven't heard of any severe dirt concerning him. He seems to be a fine, morally sound individual who would be a great President, let's get this done and make America great again.
@MarkBur57792010 We don't need Barack Obama. There are severe problems in that man's life and background that never was published and I don't need to put his business out in social media. Let's just say he isn't and never was the first Black President of the United States. Let's get Mr. Biden.
@TrumpResignApp He has worn out his welcome and that is sad. To think a man, that supposedly was elected fairly, has messed up his administration and reputation so bad, so fast only confirms to me that he is mentally ill. There can be no other explanation. Mr. Trump is certified.
@Kishan_Devani yes
@Castle_wow They may be "sorry" people but have no conscience whatsoever. Throw the book at them and then go after the people above them that probably knew of the indiscretions and iit and probably hid it by moving these people around to different areas. Intentionally endangering others.
@Castle_wow They should face the full wrath of the court and sentencing guidelines should be thrown out the window because of their blatant disregard for the law and for their congregation. I don't believe, for a minute, they are sorry.
@Castle_wow The Catholic Church, which condones celibacy for priests is sometimes targeted as the culprit but I say the priest, making the decision to enter into priesthood knowing full well the implications of that decision, and still choosing to do so, is totally to blame.
@Castle_wow It appalls me to see this never ending traipsing of "men of the cloth" involved i n the most destitute of behavior, especially for a priest. Some people have explained to me it is caused by their inability to be in an intimate relationship.
@WhatYeahOkay @lukebroadwater @no_cut_card So you are OK with this and your response, correct me if I am wrong, is like f it? If so, think about what it may do to your family, your friend's family and the future generations who don't have a voice. It is time to unite and do everything we can to elicit positive change.
@ElectRyanDorsey @BOvrsight She encouraged me to seek help for my substance abuse problem and I took her suggestion and went to BBH, at her suggestion, successfully completed the 6 month intensive inpatient program and went IOP and stayed drug free. God bless Mrs. Young. May God always have her back.
@ElectRyanDorsey @BOvrsight The reason she was reassigned is she was shot while breaking up a street dice game on Fayette Street some 10 - 15 years ago. I sent her a get well card because, even though she threatened my freedom, illegally, I still felt empathy for her.
@ElectRyanDorsey @BOvrsight I had done nothing wrong and lived in the neighborhood. A police officer of the Southeast District Police Department by the name of Loretta Young was the patrol officer who threatened me that evening. Eventually she was assigned to be the desk sergeant at Southeast.
@ElectRyanDorsey @BOvrsight The reason I should be able to sue is because this policy, ignoring the right to "probable cause", "due process", violated my and a lot of other civilian, constituents US and Maryland Civil Rights. It isn't possible it was probable. I was denied the right to walk down my street.
@ElectRyanDorsey @BOvrsight Infected, I should say. The number of "walk through's", null processes, stets on my record as a result of the ridiculous policy of Martin pretty much ruined my life as it became a never ending revolving door of arrest, jail, release. Over and over. I should be able to sue.
@ElectRyanDorsey @BOvrsight Brandon Scott publishes COMSTAT dat each and every month which was instituted way back when Ed Norris brought the system from New York under O'Malley's fiasco of an administration. Zero tolerance bullsh_t. I was, at that time living a different life, and was directly affected.
@ElectRyanDorsey @BOvrsight You know what, I am so tired of our leaders "shooting from the hip" when the citizens are getting shot in the head it sickens me. No, they don't have data to back up any of their claims because they don't take the time, away from their incessant "Photo Ops" to gather the data.
I need to speak with one of your representatives because I am currently embroiled in a couple of Civil Rights issues personally and trying to find representation and them finding someone with an open ear and open mind is near impossible. My email is stancornerjr@gmail.com,
I thought you may have been this other Sue that has wronged me because I didn't see your picture but after visiting your page I found that you aren't "that" Sue. LOL. I am following you.
@AbbyIsaacsNews I missed it Abbey. I have so many things in the fire and being pulled this way, that way. I am sure you can relate. I really needed a suit, but oh well. God will provide. Have a good evening.
@RobHelfenbein @MornaMcDermott @LesterSpence @jessicashiller @edaclumd @LBSBaltimore @AlgebraProject @TDPBaltimore What do you mean by 6 months careful? I don't follow you. I don't belive children should be exploited at all in any way. Period.
@psychdr100 @dc_tribune He is an aristocrat, look up the info about Venezuela and other countries being taken over by aristocrats. It will make your blood boil. Impeach him before it is too late.
@barbmul @politico I don't understand why, just because Paul Ryan supposedly is trying to get visas for Irish, that everyone now has this big to do ABOUT Ireland. Man, just leave it alone.
@CBSNews China could be the greatest challenge to the US since Hitler but they do it masterfully on the down-low. They have manipulated our government into a state of believing they are no threat when they are the greatest threat to democracy in history.
@CBSNews Mr. Ryan, I want to thank you for your service and I hope a non-political existence enables you to enjoy life to the fullest. In terms of China, Mr, Ryan has hit it on the nose and I believe he may be the first politician to go out on a limb challenging China. They are dangerous.
@GovLarryHogan Governor Hogan, how do we deal with such a closed minded person and God forbid it is the US president. He is caught up in self he can't see straight. You, in turn, immediately see resolution and are able to recognize the change needed immediately.
@wvjoe911 We should be able to prevent a felon from running or having a political position. Don't let Papa George be in office.
@Markc24538 Now your talking.
@FOXBaltimore That is scary but we are destroying their habitat which drives them into our back yard. You can't blame them.
@foe_us Alright, another win for Green!!!!!!
@Pastor__West @Mike_Daniels76 Amen. Thank you lord.
@BaltimoreBrew @BaltimoreDPW Who is the culprit?
@tictoc @FIU That is wonderful and congratulations. You would inspire anyone.
@AP He isn't right about most things, especially if his isn't listening to the advisers. Left to his own device he will be wrong.
@NBCNews This surprises you? This isn't news it is status quo.
@TravisAllen02 Travis are you delusional? Have you been reading the headlines?
@TravisAllen02 Thank God Chris Christie declined
Trump’s top choices for chief of staff turned him down. So now he’s looking at son-in-law Jared Kushner. https://t.co/io2VufBq5J via @HuffPostPol This is almost laughable but the severity of these decisions are scary
⚡️ “Jared Kushner under consideration for White House chief of staff, reports say” This stuff is unbelievable! We are contemplating allowing a Russian collusion participant be Chief of Staff. This administration is a joke. Impeach his ass. 		https://t.co/TeLhkGzHQy
@AntonioHayes40 @MayorPugh50 @prezjackyoung @DowntownBalt @downtownkirby @promoandarts @MtVernonMarket @NattyBohs Don't minimize this situation as Trump minimize the Saudi fiasco where Trump condoned the Prince dismembering a respected journalist over a simple difference of opinion. Trump is out of control. Reel him in.
@AntonioHayes40 @MayorPugh50 @prezjackyoung @DowntownBalt @downtownkirby @promoandarts @MtVernonMarket @NattyBohs The US is looking like a joke all because of Mr. Trump's inalienable need to have power. Impeach him and let's get back to bi-partisan healing to stop the damage he has already inflicted. Implement the appropriate sanctions on Russia to show them we will not tolerate this.
@AntonioHayes40 @MayorPugh50 @prezjackyoung @DowntownBalt @downtownkirby @promoandarts @MtVernonMarket @NattyBohs He intentionally positioned his self to attempt to acquire the position he so maniacally covets. This is treason at it's ugliest. Impeach this man and put him in jail for life or give him the appropriate and expected sentence, death. We can not afford this. Putin is smiling.
@AntonioHayes40 @MayorPugh50 @prezjackyoung @DowntownBalt @downtownkirby @promoandarts @MtVernonMarket @NattyBohs Any collusion of any kind purported by a potential candidate for the President of the United States is absolutely unacceptable and should be considered treason. Treason is punishable by death, look it up. Mr. Trump has stepped over the line. He can lie to you all but I can see!
@AntonioHayes40 @MayorPugh50 @prezjackyoung @DowntownBalt @downtownkirby @promoandarts @MtVernonMarket @NattyBohs Subsequently she was exposed and my play on it is this: Trump and his family apparently has ties to Russia. That can not be downplayed. Now, with the uncovering of this woman, it becomes apparent that there most certainly was collusion between Trump confidants and Russians
@AntonioHayes40 @MayorPugh50 @prezjackyoung @DowntownBalt @downtownkirby @promoandarts @MtVernonMarket @NattyBohs I want to bring up a point that I hope you will share with your esteemed colleagues.  Trump is already in trouble for the Cohen fiasco and now there is a 30 year old woman who apparently was trying to hob knob with some US citizens for the purpose of gaining intel on the election
@AbbyIsaacsNews You are the bomb. I got illegally evicted on October 1st and all my worldly belongings are gone. Don't get me wrong, it is just stuff but I am slowly re-accumulating things and this ion the suits is a Godsend. I love suits. Thank you. Have a safe and enjoyable Holiday Season.
@Zeke_Cohen Have a good and enjoyable weekend Zeke
@AbbyIsaacsNews Thank you so much.
@oldbtr Just like your last name indicates, your are full of bull. You don't know me or have any idea what kind of person I am. I can tell, very quickly what type you are. I will no longer conversate with you and I would appreciate the same. Have a good day. I have payed into SSI.
@AbbyIsaacsNews Abbey, we are talking about 12/19? Next Wednesday at what time? Thank you so much.
@TIME I can tell you that, it doesn't take a rocket scientist.
@washingtonpost @JRubinBlogger Nancy, isn't it nice that you aren't the center of attention?
@washingtonpost And?
@psychdr100 Donald, is there anything else you want to mess up before you are impeached? If so, be my guest.
@covestro What happens in a bad accident or don't they happen anymore?
@SenSchumer @SenateDems Chuck, give it up. Don't you have anything better to do? You are a Senator, correct?
@SenSchumer @realDonaldTrump Amazing
@becky_koenig Not at the expense of civil rights, Becky.
@RectorSun Yea, but we as constituents should know about it, John. I beg your pardon, I didn't promise you a rose garden.
@scottmcalvert @WSJ Well, I didn't like this little secretive violations of rights. If this was happening and the powers to be in Baltimore coaxed funding for it. Shame on them.
@CKefalas What a loss. My wife used to serve him at lunches over at the Travel Plaza and she indicated to me how nice of a man he was and very giving. He always treated her with respect and asked for her by name if she wasn't there. Amazing to relate to it.
@MornaMcDermott @RobHelfenbein @LesterSpence @jessicashiller @edaclumd @LBSBaltimore @AlgebraProject @TDPBaltimore Well, I want to be careful about how I tiptoe around this story because the wording is questionable and how it minimizes the children is scary but I don't believe that is the real intention of the donations and why.
@CNN You think?
@GovLarryHogan @GovernorVA Thank you Governor Hogan for being you and thank God that the governor of Virginia wants to partner with Maryland. Very smart move.
@WhipHoyer @realDonaldTrump Steny, you just keep being the upstanding person you are and have been and let ole Donald boy eat a peach, an impeach that is. LOL.
@iduncan She isn't smiling in that PhotoOp is she? What a joke.
@USATODAY Pence looks dumbfounded like he is. Dumb for supporting Trump and founded in jail next.
@washingtonpost It is already justified. He is way over the line. He isn't treading on it he has stomped on it or is it smocked. I am soooo confused. Just like he looks in the picture. Is it quiet reflection or prayer he gets the hell outta Dodge, quickly.
@Popdust I don't drink so I really aren't interested but I understand the thing with the Wine Clubs. It would be a great alternative if I did imbibe.

@Channel4News Mrs. May, you have put your country at risk. You did not hear this kind of crap when Tony Blair was in power.
@TIME Donald, we want you impeached. Don't you get it?
@iduncan Bullshit. How the heck can it be the fault of ma software program? No, it is in the numbers. Somebodies playing with the till. Just for everyone's information: $600 million dollars of Baltimore City pension money is gone. I heard a police officer talking to a court baliff today.

@SenSchumer @realDonaldTrump Build a city in Arizona or Texas. Put a wall around it and let them all live there and destroy each other. The solutions is simple and staring you in the face. We did it to the Indians, the Japanese during WWII, the boat people under the freeways in Miami (freeways, Yeah right).
@WhiteHouse That is not what is clear, what is clear is that you Republicans, if you support Mr. Trump's insanity, is willing to shut the government down over immigration. This is a childish tirade and I am not saying that something doesn't have to happen, kit does.
@lukebroadwater Mr. Hogan continues to impress me with his ardor for the right thing. He is certainly a power of example and Maryland is fortunate to have such a man leading this State. He has persevered through the hardest of times with grace.
@psychdr100 Hey Paul, keep jumping on people's band wagon when you have no idea of their real motivations. Shocked, Huh? See, you are one of the reasons that the Democratic party is a mess and why the Republicans are gaining such a foothold in American politics.
@realDonaldTrump You have no parachute on and when you hit the ground you may make a dent in it you are so hard headed. To think of the people that you could have lead. It is a shame and a sham. How is it going to feel being the second president to be impeached, sir.
@realDonaldTrump Your character, as twisted as it is, doesn't lend itself to leading people. You are judgmental, biased and to be associated with you is a death sentence as Cohen and all your other cohorts will find out. You are taking a dive sir.
@realDonaldTrump You are the most biased person I have ever encountered and I am ashamed that you are the representative that we the people have to tolerate as the voice of America. Mr. Trump, you should be trying to lead people in a positive way.
@MunibLohrasbi @OSIBaltimore @DisabRightsMD Anything positive you are able to institute is better than anything. My wife was negatively impacted by this experience more than I can explain and she was a wonderful woman. An Angel in disguise.
@SciPhilOrg When and if I am able to get funding, I will begin the process of change and implement the ideas when I can. Pray that God opens some doors for me!!!!
@SciPhilOrg I am hoping, through some miracle, I am able to garner some people's belief in my ideals so that I can get support for my ideas. These ideas are profound and have the ability to change society and help the unfortunate. I recording the ideas and will patent/copyright them
@SciPhilOrg I have so many great ideas but, because of the damage I have done to my self by my past misfortunes perpetrated by myself I are pretty poor. I have genius and with a clear head the ideas just keep flooding in but I don't have a way of turning it into change.
O'Malley was a flagrant ahole. Kate should have been the mayor not the egotist Martin. He let a great officer in Ed Norris flap int the wind and didn't support him the the sh_t hit the fan. Ed Norris was a good cop. Baltimore just wasn't ready nor will it be for zero tolerance.
@bmorehistoric We get caught up in the current and recent unpleasantness of what has occurred to this great city and forget what we have contributed. I blame it on the politicians. Not since Schaeffer has this city had a visionary in office. It is not because I am white, either.
@bmorehistoric I am a person, native Baltimorean, who although I knew a little mof this city's storied past didn't know how really important Baltimore is. We, as natives, should promote the greatness that Baltimore is.
@NWS_BaltWash Well, I was kinda hoping we would see some snow. I am still a kid at heart and I don't get all panicky over snow. I like it!!!

@OSIBaltimore @MunibLohrasbi @DisabRightsMD I made it my job to protect her here on earth. I will forever live in my heart and soul and I miss her dearly. What a woman!!!
@OSIBaltimore @MunibLohrasbi @DisabRightsMD I can tell you she was affected negatively severely by this experience. Experiencing PTSD symptoms and it left a mark on this angel, and I don't say this about her because we were a couple. When I met her I saw the angelic properties she possessed immediately.
@OSIBaltimore @MunibLohrasbi @DisabRightsMD Let me tell you this, with certainty. My wife, God bless her and love to her always, was locked up in Jessup for almost nine years and the conditions she had to deal with left an indelible mark on her. She had already served that time before I actually met her and fell in love.

@WMAR2News This is significant because Jimmy Dean is a very good brand with, previously, a very good reputation. This is sad.
@WhiteHouse You know, I have to agree also but I don';t want to give Trump any credit for something positive. He doesn't deserve it.
@CNN Kennedy saying something so ridiculous as "Jesus loving Trump" is almost blasphemous. With the 2 supposed charges coming out of the Cohen trial hello impeachment Mr. Trump. It has been nice but welcome to Federal prison. Are you happy now, Mr. Ego/Adulterer?
@Popdust Wow, thank you.
@TIME I have heard nothing but horror stories concerning these autocratic leaders of these countries like Duterte. The documentary indicated that these countries have problems reforming back into Democracies and most have never recovered.
@washingtonpost I don't know whether 1,000 pounds of supposed moon rocks is concrete, play on words? evidence. How about some photos of other related "Moon" mission stuff. I have had doubts about this for years and I always said the TV feeds from the supposed landing looked staged to me.
@NBCNews I am absolutely sickened by the senseless death of children.
@psychdr100 Oh, poor Donald.
@TheTylt Whats wrong with that? Scott shouldn't be cheating. If he is going to so blatantly show his adultery publicly, then report it. His ass deserves it.
@WSJ Here we go with China. They are going to be a huge problem and we created it. The government created it. Just like the HOV project at 695/95. China financed that project and we, as a country, are so indebted to China it is ridiculous. It is amazing how prophesy comes true.
@iduncan @lukebroadwater Governor Hogan continues to do things for the right reasons and I have been impressed from day one. It doesn't matter whether a person is a Republican or Democrat or Independent. What matters is what they stand up for and how they perform and I give Mr. Hogan an A+
Bay Professional Services on #Google https://t.co/HK6ebXaT0K
It sits on his lot today with another unfortunate person renting it. He is using another person to increase his wealth. He has to be stopped. I only receive $750/month SSI. He is a multi millionaire. He goes home to a warm place each night. I haven't had a bath/shower for a month
I only wish that someone would listen to me and help. This man has turned my life upside down for no reason. I actually think he enjoys he likes it. He has to like it. Why else would he do it. He threw away all my wordly belongings and stole the trailer I lived in.
The State's Attorney actually embraced this crap. He also filed it 4 days after it alledgedly happened on October 5th. Why did he wait? My cat and I are still homeles today. I had a heart attack in October as a reult of the stress and worry. How much can one man indure?
I, myself on my own, filed a grievance against the State's Attorney and filed a motion to dismiss the assault charge which were entered into the record. The State was offering me 2 years suspended for something I didn't do. He is 6'2" 250 pounds, I am 5'6" 140 pounds.
Which the Baltimore City State's Attorney at Wabash picked up and threw out my charges against the landlord, slumlord violating my US 14th Constitutional Right to "Due Process". The charges also are retaliatory violating Maryland Statute 208.1 law.
I found my wife dead on July 1st in extremely questionable circumstances and the cause of death is undertimined. I honestly believe this landlord has something to do with it becuase of the abrupt way he evicted me for no reason. He lodged a fabricated 2nd Degree Assault on me.
I was illegally evicted by a multi millionaire slumlord, narcissist on October 1st and I am having problems getting representation or help in this matter. I am a very good person, intelligent, Christian. Yes, I will admit I had problems in the past but I have changed.
⚡️ “Green Stuff”		https://t.co/C5KFON32Y2

@Zeke_Cohen Zeke, I commend you for making a stand. Something isn't right and Mr. Fitzgerald's response tells it all. He needs to be removed as a prospect. He will not help this city. Let him ruin Ft. Worth. I never are trying to step on anyones toes but if I do, please go to the foot doctor
@DanRodricks Dan, let me say that I have always admired and respected you. You have the envious ability to say things to help society. You can bring to the forefront things like this to mainstream society that make people think and hopefully change how we interact. Thank you. Stan.
@SkyNews I am against any type of tyrancy especially in places where, maybe, the society pretends to making strides away from communism, socialism or any of the other governments which try to control society. What occurred in France shows me that an enormous amount of work remains.
@SkyNews I appreciate that people appreciate my viewpoints. So many people nowadays wnat to politically correct it makes me vomit. I, in turn, just would like people to love on another and treat each other with respect. I really don't think it such a huge thing to ask.
@RobbynLewis46th @DelMaggie43 @BELBaltimore @reginatboyce @ElectWells @TonyBridges41 May I ask what you hope the town hall will reveal? I am not being sarcastic. I am really interested.
@CouncilmanBMS @prezjackyoung Further, that may have eased the critique you will get unless your are spending personal money to fund the trip, otherwise, shame on you! It looks more like a vacation then a political fact finding mission. Why are politician so devious, sir?
@CouncilmanBMS @prezjackyoung Mr. Scott, may I ask you what you are hoping to learn from the leaders in Dallas or are you really checking on Mr. Fitzgerald. If you are, why the diversion try? Do you think the constituients in Baltimore are stupid? Why didn't you invite somebody not politically connected?
@spootieman @CouncilmanBMS @prezjackyoung I let you go there, no sense in overwhelming him with such tawdry details, EH?
@DennisCash14 @CouncilmanBMS @dcollinsWBAL @prezjackyoung Mr. Cash, don't be so direct. LOL.
@CouncilmanBMS @prezjackyoung Have a good time. Dallas is very nice.
@MarylandConnect Yes, I want to change my MCO from Baltimore Medical Systems to Maryland Physician Care. Also, I need my red and white MA card. BMS has very poor customer service at their Fleet St. clinic. I would be more than happy to expound on the terrible service just let me know how.
@freedomandjust I have a legal issue that is serious and the person who has violated me (not physically) is getting away with it. Seems I can't get help in Baltimore with this. Why then would laws be passed to protect tenants from illegal eviction?
@deray What are you afraid of? I am not a homo or homophobic. I have had friends that were bi or whatever. You may need to look at yourself concerning this. You may have some reservations?
@nerdist8 It's really conversion or theft anyway. With phones being so expensive it makes sense.
@nerdist8 Make it a law that a person has to return the phone to a store that the carrier has and then allow the store to contact the owner so that it gets returned. It has gotten to be an epidemic and people are doing it too much. Punish them.
@nerdist8 We need to legislate making steal phones and/or not returning phones to rightful owner a felony, period. We have become too dependent on the technology and store too much sensitive material on them that the times has come to prosecute those people who make others' lives miserable
@nerdist8 You know, I am not going to ring in about what phone to get but I am going to discuss the ridiculous way people either find phones or steal phones and then don't give them back to the rightful owner. This has happened so many times to my I mam sick of it.
@jato791 @DanRodricks I agree one million percent
He will implode and the true nature of the beast will be exposed with all the ugliness he possesses. I have seen the beast, I know. I am not doing this out of vengeance but for vindication. Thank you for your time and I hope to hear from you. Please, I need help. Sincerely, Stan.
Without bond to assure he doesn't have the ability to maneuver and contact the conspirator to coach them on how to respond. I guarantee that when you explain to the conspirators that they potentially are looking at significant jail time they will roll over on him.
All concerned parties will have to be involved in this from the beginning and when the charges are brought forth you will have to freeze his assets, which are significant (millions of dollars of assets, I have a list). Upon freezing the assets he will have to be arrested and held
If we were to begin investigating this matter the US State Attorney, Baltimore County and County prosecutors, Federal Food and Drug Administration, Maryland Department of Licensing, IRS, US POstal Service, ATF; the list goes on. I have given this ample thought.
He is 6'2" 250 pounds and could be a linebacker on the Ravens, I am 5'6" 140 pounds and 60 years old. I don't have a violent cell in my body. He is a narcissist and a woman abuser. I have woman who will attest to the fact that he beat them. Contact me at stancornerjr@gmail.com
I had a heart attack and was hospitalized for four days as a result of the stress and fear, PTSD if you want to get specific. I could not sleep, fearful he was going to do something to me, physically. He fabricated a false statement of charges claiming he was assaulted.
When I attempted to protect myself when he blatantly discarded all my worldly possessions, without any thought, he crossed a boundary that is unacceptable to me. He did this right after I had lost a second wife to death two months prior. I was grieving when he evicted me.
I am a college graduate, a Mensa member with a very high IQ, a Christian. I belong to a recovery fellowship and have turned my life around. This person had me illegally evicted Oct. 1st after renting from him for 3 years never being late or short on my rent payments.
Please feel free to contact me at stancornerjr@gmail.com. Please don't be affected by my record, maam, because I will admit I had my struggles with substance abuse and was a victim of Mr. O'Malley's zero tolerance posturing when he was mayor. You will see a correlation.
I can outline what, where, how, who, when and are not complicit in any of it. This has been occurring for the 25 years I have known this individual. It is big time. A lot of Federal level violations like buying food stamps, grand theft, wire fraud, mail fraud, gambling and more.
The person directing this criminal activities, with multiple conspirators, never actually got their hands "dirty" similar to the behavior of Mr. Manson with his concubine. Although the crimes being committed in this case do not rise to the level of Mr Manson, they are just as bad
The main person that was doing the actual crimes was an employee of this person and had a drug habit so this person felt as if the employee was expendable and eventually the employee did indeed get caught stealing and subsequently did jail time as a result.
Because they were having problems accumulating enough solid evidence on this person I believe they backed off. During this time the person in question maneuvered to change vehicles by selling them and purchasing different ones to disguise the vehicles used in crimes.
By disclosing this information I will be in danger. I mean my life will be in danger. He is that dangerous and rageful. I am not over dramatizing the nature of these crimes, they are significant. He was being investigated by Baltimore County Police as a major theft ring.
I have intimate knowledge concerning a person in East Baltimore who portrays their self as a "pillar" of the community but who, on the back burner, is and has been for decades breaking Federal, State and Local laws. This person probably is RICO material.
Mrs. Miller, I have always had the utmost respect for your investigative reporting and I honestly can't think of a report, at least on the local level, who does a better job than you. I am not saying this lightly. I'm a Baltimore native who has followed your career over the years
I could be in danger as a result of disclosing this information.
How would your investigative news department want to have a potentially front page story about a person who portrays their self as a pillar of the community but who is feloniously breaking the law at the Federal, State and Local level. I know intimate details of the crimes.
How would your investigative reporting department want a potentially front page story? I may one but the person of interest maybe dangerous and desperate. I may also be at risk by revealing the details. This involves crimes on the Federal, State and Local level by a narcissist.

@AntonioHayes40 @MayorPugh50 @prezjackyoung @DowntownBalt @downtownkirby @promoandarts @MtVernonMarket @NattyBohs He had the nerve to tweet, not long ago, how because of his leadership and he made it very clear; since his inauguration how great the nation is doing and it is all because of his direction.

@AntonioHayes40 @MayorPugh50 @prezjackyoung @DowntownBalt @downtownkirby @promoandarts @MtVernonMarket @NattyBohs Please don't take offense with what I am saying. I am certainly not underestimating the significance of your accomplishments.

@AntonioHayes40 @MayorPugh50 @prezjackyoung @DowntownBalt @downtownkirby @promoandarts @MtVernonMarket @NattyBohs Antonio, I am very proud and uplifted that these things are being done and quite frankly I don't get why when people do things that are just naturally right to do, we shout to the rooftops as if it is something special. This is especially true with "politicians".

I am very concerned as to why you are on a forced? opiod taper.From what I gather from your tweet you are not happy with this. Am I right? Because I can relate.
@ladygaga Can I ask, what the hell is that? And why is this so to be posted as if it is a ground breaking event?
@TIME I think Trump influenced the news more but not in a positive way so just because a person influences the news doesn't make that person "news worthy".
@CNN You know, this whole thing is a farce and for Trump to "act as if" MBS did nothing, he is right! His cronies did it at his direction so Trump is just skipping around the issue. What makes me sick more than anything is the sickening fact that these people dismembered that man.

@realDonaldTrump @realDonaldTrump get real sir. You are the epitome of an ego maniac and narcissist. You continuously take credit where credit isn't due. You give no one else credit for the things that they do and the country is in so much better shape since you came into office. Please.
@BaltBizOnline Look Mayor Pugh isn't going to do anything so stop hoping. She is an photo op mayor not an action mayor. She will go down in history as just another "do nothing" mayor collecting some unheard of severance package. We get nothing. Sound familiar?

@washingtonpost This man is carrying out war atrocities in Yemen. He ordered the dismemberment of a journalist. What in the hell is the Trump administration thinking when there are no consequences for a man like this. He has more wealth than Mr. Trump and that has to irk him. NahNahNahNahNahNah,
@wbaltv11 Here we go!!!!!!!! The shit is going to roll uphill in this case. Thank God.
@AP Defrocked? He should be de-balled. There is no excuse for this behavior. Sick is as sick is as sick can be.
@BBCWorld The operative word in the sentence was the "test" part. A test is a test. It may not be accurate all the time but we rely them at the behest of the person whom can have their life destroyed by a bad test. We need to rethink this whole test kit phenomena.
@WMAR2News Acquisition, restructure, big business America = Bad business for middle America. Hello foreclosure, hello domestic violence, hello car repossession. Do you get me. Bayer get with the program and try to build jobs not dismantle companies with your Big Pocket mentality.
@sammy_saucee @Beyonce They are just people, my God, get over it!!!!
@BBCWorld Unacceptable, fire them,
@eobaltimore @iduncan @Zeke_Cohen Mr. Fitzgerald, have a nice day and do it in Fort Worth, sir. I don't think Mrs. Pugh is qualified to choose a good candidate for this position. She does better with photo ops. Ask her media relations people. It's all about the image, not the results. Sorry.
@eobaltimore @iduncan @Zeke_Cohen I would suggest, Mr. Fitzgerald, that you may want to consider withdrawing your name out of the proverbial hat because, sir, you are not up for this job. You would not be questioning the vetting process in this great city. Do you know the history of this city? Steeped in history.
@eobaltimore @iduncan @Zeke_Cohen How about the highest HIV rate for one particular zip code in the United States? How about the largest "open air" drug market in the country? The most violent city in America? The 11th violent city in the world? Are you getting the picture? And you wonder why we scrutinize? More:
@eobaltimore @iduncan @Zeke_Cohen Mr. Fitzgerald, have you taken the time and effort to get a background on the city you so ardently want to serve for??? How you heard of a Mr. Norris? Have you seen the statistics on Baltimore's current and former murder rates per capita? How about it's addiction rate? More......
@eobaltimore @iduncan @Zeke_Cohen Well let me tell you how I feel about Mr. Fitzgerald's comments on Mr. Cohen having to file a FOIA in order to get background information. Further, he didn't feel that he should be scrutinized as hard as he has for this position and I counter with this. Follows............
@GovLarryHogan Mr. Hogan. I want to congratulate you on a great first term in office. You handled most things with a demeanor that accentuates class. I also send my condolences to you and your family over your courageous fight with cancer and the opiod crisis fight that has touched almost all.
@CNN Just a beautiful display of kindness
@baltimoresun I can believe that. Because as I traveled today in that wind I noticed that my breathing did get a little labored.
@ProPublica He isn't going to stop a policy he believes in. He will simply put the curtains up and shield his administration from the truth. Welcome to the Trump administration.
@LiveFeedLville @Lj_era8 He seems to be a stand-up guy.
@RickRitterWJZ @wjz I don't know what to say about this behavior by the criminal element in Baltimore City that no one in the judicial system, especially Mrs. Moseby cronies, have tried to correct. They don't have enough balls, excuse the pun. If you look closer, you may find they may be involved.
@WSJ Look to Mr. Donald and the CIA. Remember, the FBI is not his friend. He put them under the bus, politically.
@GlassesUSA How do I get my prescription to you
@CNN Trump is going to continue to "Shuck and Jive". He is an ego-maniacal arse.
@Eater @deray Why the hell should Chik-Fil-A be concerned about anything gender related. Stop making that stuff political and get on with your life. Stop stirring the pot. You are the one with issues, not everyone else. Grow up.
@iduncan Why wasn't the council made aware of all the details concerning Mr. Fitzgerald? This was supposed to be public. There she goes again, hiding details. People in the news industry and people with political powers need to make her accountable.
@TheTylt Here is the problem. We involved ourselves so many years ago and actually lied about the reason. I am not going to get into the actual reasons. Anyway, as a result, this encroachment upon them is not easily rectified. Thank Mr. Bush. He was trying to vindicate his father. Bad.
@TheTylt I want to see this show. Is it only viewable via Netflix?
@TheTylt I think that anyone's private life is no one's business unless the athlete makes it public. What I mean by this is: Let's say Joe the Athlete contends he is solid, principled persdon. He is then arrested on Domestic Violence charges. He has opened a can of worms he can't close.
@Geosmaniac I believe they suspended you and I agree with you. It certainly isn't a suspendable thing.
@CakeyMarie Cuda, why am I able to see this stuff??
@coachtodaro @honoluaman07 @greed_cap @jimcramer Look, the bottom line for whatever reason is American products are downright more expensive, significantly. They are made better, though. It is kind of an oxymoron. I really would like every American to "Buy American". People's love of money defeats this idealism.
@GM Shame on you. The government bails you out, not to long ago. Everyone complains about Japan's take over of the auto industry. Our steel industry is gone as a result. We bitch about China's dominance in the world economy and this is GM's response. How do you sleep at night????
You know, we as Americans wonder why there may be a shortage of jobs (good jobs especially) and then we bitch and moan about Latinos taking jobs and so forth. Then, GM makes another ridiculous decision to shut 5 pklants.  That industry used to be a proud one. Not anymore.
Hang em high, the correctional officers that is and not literally.
I agree Mr. Rather but I understand that Mr. Trump is an ego maniac and his ego has to be fed. Ego stands for "Easing God Out". You cannot serve two masters or love God and money. You, sir, have integrity. There is nothing that you nor I can do to change Mr. Trump.
Sickening. This is what turns me away from social media. That is so private there has to be something wrong with your conception of right and wrong. Good and evil. Morals and values. You have none.
Your story on the dinner that has been going on for 3 years is inspirational and a blessing showing the power of love. Sincerely, Stan from Baltimore, Maryland.
@ladygaga All my regards to a remarkable woman. May you have a wonderful holiday season, Sincerely, Stan from Baltimore Maryland.
@AaronRodgers12 Mr. Rodgers, you are most certainly a power of example and the Green Bay Packer organization should be proud to be affiliated with you.
@atrupar Mr. Trump (Oh, excuse me, that s/b Mr. President), it would be much better if you could have even the slightest amount of humility.  What you profess may be true, any momentum that has occurred was been result of a whole lot of people before and after you. Sorry.
