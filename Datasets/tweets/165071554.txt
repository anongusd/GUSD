@continetti @NRO Stop acting like you're an arbiter of what's anti-Semitic. Many Jews, including me, think @AIPAC has had a pernicious influence on American politics &amp; Israeli policies under @Netanyahu have damaged Israel's world standing.	@IlhanMN was spot on. It's all about the Benjamins
@VP You say the @GOP was right to call out @SteveKingIA's racism. It took 16yrs of White Supremacist rhetoric before they did.	The Hypocrisy is breathtaking esp. considering many Jews, including me, do not consider @IlhanMN going after @AIPAC anti-Semitic.	It is about the Benjamins!

@realDonaldTrump Poor, poor Donald.	Perhaps if you hadn't kneecapped the economy w/your trade wars, the ridiculous #TrumpShutdown &amp; other stupid decision.	Everything you have been touting are LAGGING indicators. Forward looking indicators are nowhere near as rosy.
@realDonaldTrump If this were true, why has the stock price of US Steel dropped from $33.38 on the day you were inaugurated to $20.70 today? Other steel producers have also dropped significantly. 	Hmmm. https://t.co/Nl8UC5xzwz
@SomeTexas @seanhannity @AOC Trump is right: Hundreds of companies have announced they are returning to the US. But not because of his policies.	Let's not forget about Harley-Davidson, Carrier (jobs he claimed to have save) GM...who continue to leave. https://t.co/CQ9vNmCcxV
@SomeTexas @seanhannity @AOC I said you are full of it. Hardly an attack. Trump is riding the Obama Economy. The sugar high of the #GOPTaxScam has worn off. Explain where there is big improvement beyond continuing the trend since we rebounded fron the @GOP induced Great Recession https://t.co/WOCALn02TX
@ssssweetsue @seanhannity @AOC The % of wealth has skewed hugely to the top 1%, even more to the top 0.1%.	Taxcode has so many special interest loopholes that benefit them. It's ridiculous.	I blame both parties but recently it's mainly the @GOP. The #GOPTaxScam is a great example. Peanuts for the middle-class
@ssssweetsue @seanhannity @AOC Good for them. I mean it.	Not everyone gets assistance or can work in public sector but college is only one thing.	The data is damning. CEO's made ~10X average worker's pay in 70's, now ~400X. Most need 2 incomes to support a family. A big majority have &lt;$10k cushion many &lt;$1k.
@ssssweetsue @seanhannity @AOC Anecdotal! Glad for them but, either they had financial assistance or savings or were saddled w/far more debt than they would have been back then.	It's true some are OK now and some struggled then but a significantly higher percentage struggle now.
@SomeTexas @seanhannity @AOC So, on the whole, you are full of it.
@SomeTexas @seanhannity @AOC I was there. Sure if you pick specific yrs &amp; ignore stuff like the Arab Oil Embargo but generally the middle-class was better off when CEO's made 10X workers pay, not 400X, when tax loopholes for special interests didn't explode &amp; the highest earners paid 70+% on $'s in top tier.
