@_Four_Horsemen @Support @GSpellchecker I'd like an answer to that question myself.
@HouseOfAtheism @iamAtheistGirl ...then reject the evidence.
1/You actually know a lot less than many atheists do about the Bible, Christianity and church history ‚Äì but still call yourself a Christian.
2/You define 0.01% as a ‚Äúhigh success rate‚Äù when it comes to answered prayers &amp; you think the remaining 99.99% FAILURE was the will of God.
3/ science/history/ biology &amp; physics fail to convince you but some idiot rolling on the floor speaking in ‚Äútongues‚Äù proves Xtianity.
4/  You believe in an eternal Hell for all but a few and yet consider your religion the most ‚Äútolerant‚Äù and ‚Äúloving.‚Äù
5/ You spend your life looking for loopholes in the scientifically established age of Earth but believe dates claimed by Bronze Age herders
6/ You laugh at Hindus who deify humans &amp; Greek claims about gods sleeping with women but  believe that the Holy Spirit impregnated Mary
7/ ...and when he ordered the elimination of entire ethnic groups in ‚ÄúJoshua‚Äù including women, children, and trees! /2
7/Your outraged over ‚Äúatrocities‚Äù attributed to Allah, but you're ok with God/Jehovah slaughtering all the babies of Egypt in ‚ÄúExodus‚Äù /1
8/You laugh at polytheists, but you have no problem believing in a Triune God.
9/You're insulted when scientists say we evolved from other life forms, but have no problem with the claim that we were created from dirt.
Top Ten Signs You‚Äôre a Fundamentalist Christian10/You deny the existence of 1000s of other gods but outraged when someone denies yours.
