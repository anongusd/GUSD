@realDonaldTrump ... But don‚Äôt blame me when someone sends a bomb to their headquarters like CNN
@benshapiro When you don‚Äôt have an actual argument so you pivot to another issue.
@senrobportman Actually 7, and Garfield was 3rd, not last.
@JakeabaileyJb @spyrokeet @SenToddYoung @GeorgeRClarkNPS He effectively changed the name of the park because it was already a National Lakeshore and received the same federal protection.
@JakeabaileyJb @spyrokeet @SenToddYoung @GeorgeRClarkNPS Only in name.  They receive the same protection under the National Parks Service, same with the Lincoln Boyhood National Memorial in Lincoln City.
@SenToddYoung It was already a National Lakeshore and received the same protection as a National Park and was administered by the National Parks Service. You effectively changed the name of the park. But on the surface it looks like you did a lot more. It‚Äôs actually impressively smart politics
@tedcruz This is cute, but I kinda want to see the outtakes for it. 	https://t.co/9O7RT9MTmA
After seeing my first movie from 2019, here were my favorites from 2018 (of the 20 I saw)	1. Game Night	2. Death of Stalin	3. Deadpool 2	4. Isle of Dogs	5. Hostiles
@brithume It‚Äôs so embarrassing. People should never see you buy clothes. She should do what everyone does and pretend we were born with clothes on our body and a fully stocked closet for all ages and events. Shameful.
@BruceBmh @Lrihendry @realDonaldTrump So is it 50% or 52%? also 100 million people is not enough for either of those. That‚Äôs only 30% of Americans or 44% of American adults.
@realDonaldTrump 100% victory over ISIS? Tell that to our troops in Afghanistan.
@realDonaldTrump Republicans control the Senate.  If someone‚Äôs walking slowly, it‚Äôs probably Jim Risch.
@Lrihendry @realDonaldTrump üòÇüòÇThat‚Äôs like a 30% approval rating. At least try to research something.
@realDonaldTrump Yeah, SNL has been pulling the wool over the eyes of the liberals. Word has it that they don‚Äôt even hire real journalists and the whole thing is written by comedians! I also have it on good authority that it‚Äôs so fictional, it wins Primetime Emmys. #fakenews #wegotem https://t.co/OGmjILaGgQ
@realDonaldTrump NEXT TIME YOU GET STUCK ON CAPS LOCK, THE BUTTON IS ON THE BOTTOM LEFT. HAPPY TWEETING!
@realDonaldTrump @TuckerCarlson You know you have an uphill battle when you‚Äôre trying to prove the constitution is unconstitutional. #politics
@GOPLeader *cough cough* STEVE KING *cough cough*
@charliekirk11 @DonaldJTrumpJr @AOC All you quoted was the words ‚Äúunwilling to work‚Äù, that could have been used in any context.  Like this:	Charlie Kirk says zoo elephants will ‚Äúdestroy our country.  We cannot allow them to gain power.‚Äù
@GOPChairwoman Was the MS-13 member an illegal immigrant?  Also, you can change context to make anything sound bad.		Cirque du Soleil gave their first ever performance in RRM‚Äôs home state last week.		Her response: Our national security is in a place where even my kids are concerned.
@RepRossSpano Yes, it would be highly inefficient for you, a Florida congressman, to take the Oregon Trail to get to DC.
@Jaja_In_SF @KimStrassel Actually, says the idiot who is sarcastically agreeing with the other idiot to make a point, apparently unsuccessfully
@KenCalvert Are you criticizing the awkward wording or the idea that as a good with fewer negative externalities becomes less inferior, it pulls demand away from a superior good with more negative externalities?
@JKCorden Some Vinny Gambini level stuff here
@KimStrassel Hilarious! Dems are idiots! It's almost like they're tying to prevent a mass extinction or something! Not if it means we have to plant a couple trees and produce bio energy through carbon capture and storage, am I right?
@SenateGOP Zero emissions ‚â† no emissions. You can still have cars and planes as long as we use carbon dioxide removal methods like creating bio energy with carbon capture and storage or through just planting more trees. And this video has nothing to do with socialism. #failedtomongerfear
@SenatorDurbin @RepRobinKelly @RepDannyDavis @RepBillFoster @RepCasten @RepUnderwood This picture represents American democracy: low-turnout, everyone looks dissatisfied, dominated by big-potato companies
@DonaldJTrumpJr NBC had been looking to fire her before because her ratings were much lower than Today's Take, the show she replaced. However, she spent so much time covering MeToo allegations within NBC, that it would look like they were protecting themselves. Her comments gave them an excuse.
@TPCarney Your article does not account for the order in which resignations occur.  More importantly, your article does NOT contain a flowchart.  Here is an example of a flowchart you may find useful for future articles. https://t.co/b1AkMgMOBj
@KeithRothfus ‚ÄúThe god-given right to life is not an establishment of religion‚Äù  By definition everything god does is religion.  This is like saying the mlb instating the infield fly rule is not an establishment of sport.
@DonaldJTrumpJr @TMZ Actually not a presidential candidate
@lar_gun1 @charliekirk11 Mueller‚Äôs plea deal with Manafort included the forfeiture of about $45M in assets which is greater than the $17-20M spent on the investigation so far.  Regardless, turning a profit is not the reason we have law enforcement.
@Jim_sees @kleetampa @realDonaldTrump If you use historical precedent to say democrats are trying to steal elections now, then the same historical precedent can be used to say republicans are stealing elections now.  Even though election fraud wasn‚Äôt proven in either case, they hold equal relevance to 2018.
@Craftingqueen1 @lar_gun1 @charliekirk11 ‚ÄúWas‚Äù, so you can rest assured they‚Äôre not wasting their time on it.  Just like how they‚Äôre no longer investigating the Lindbergh kidnapping or the Osage murders.
@lar_gun1 @charliekirk11 It‚Äôs sounded like you thought the FBI was wasting resources on one investigation.  I just thought I‚Äôd let you know they‚Äôre not doing that investigation.
@lar_gun1 @charliekirk11 The FBI isn‚Äôt investigating Russian interference.  Bob Mueller who is the Special Counsel to the Justice Department and his team are.
@charliekirk11 @DonaldJTrumpJr Proof?
@Jim_sees @kleetampa @realDonaldTrump Why not bring up Republican President Rutherford B. Hayes stealing the 1876 election in exchange for ending reconstruction?
@realDonaldTrump Uh, Nelson never conceded.
@realDonaldTrump Elections have consequences.
@GOPChairwoman The size of a county is an arbitrary measure of determining how long it should take to count votes. Infrastructure and workforce relative to the number of votes is the factor.  Mcdonald‚Äôs doesn‚Äôt take longer to make food because they‚Äôre the largest fast food chain. #basicstuff
@julie_kelly2 @DonaldJTrumpJr I think you‚Äôre confused.  This is what it looks like to push someone away. https://t.co/tVYnKscO7P
@julie_kelly2 @DonaldJTrumpJr Where‚Äôs the push?
@DonaldJTrumpJr @SenatorBrakey He is not a fake independent. He truthfully is not a member of a party, hence independent. #gov101
@realDonaldTrump Uhhhh.. I‚Äôm glad you finally got to this conclusion. Better late than never #trump #mueller #SpecialCounsel
@DonaldJTrumpJr Uh, the sky will get ominously dark but the top of the Capitol will still be illuminated somehow? Not sure how that works, but it looks like it would be cool for a night. #beveryafraid #fear #thehorror #listentomeonly #scaretactic
@realDonaldTrump @FoxNews Don‚Äôt worry, I heard someone call her the Least Corrupt Member of Congress! So, I think the two cancel out. Isn‚Äôt hearsay so useful when you don‚Äôt have actual evidence? #2018 #Election2018 #California
@DevinNunes Uhh, you already have the house. And democrats rioting wouldn‚Äôt help gop win the house back because it‚Äôs conditioned on you already winning, So riots would be after the fact.  And are you saying violent Dems would be good because it helps you politically? #prioritycheck
@KeithRothfus Words are cheap. Prayers are free. What actions have you ever taken to prevent something like this from happening? I wish I could tell you to give back the money you‚Äôve taken from the nra since 2012, but it‚Äôs too late. Why should innocent people have to die for your job security?
@TreyMcMillan83 @RepGosar @MerriamWebster I‚Äôm not saying that they actually all meet the criteria to enter the country. I‚Äôm responding to the hypothetical gosar provided by saying ‚Äúeven if they are perfect people‚Äù and ‚Äúperfect people‚Äù from an immigration standpoint implies they meet the criteria for entry.
@TreyMcMillan83 @RepGosar @MerriamWebster ‚ÄúPerfect people‚Äù implies they are eligible to enter legally, and we don‚Äôt turn away people who qualify to enter legally because we don‚Äôt have an immigration cap. Also caravans don‚Äôt attempt to enter illegally. The last one stopped at the border and sought asylum at CBP stations.
@RepGosar How would we be losing our sovereignty by allowing a lot of perfect people into our country under our own immigration laws?  What is it you think the word ‚Äúsovereignty‚Äù means? @MerriamWebster a little help here please
@RepGosar You have a majority in the house and the senate and a president who‚Äôs willing to sign off.  It‚Äôs time republicans quit trying to make every topic a divisive issue and start taking responsibility for their own inactions. #notinmyhouseofreps #actlikeanadult
@JohnCornyn After seeing Brett Kavanaugh behave under new circumstances, @ABAesq are updating his rating with the new info.  They haven‚Äôt even said if it will change.  What‚Äôs partisan about that?  I don‚Äôt get it.  #kavanaugh #amimissingsomething
Someone should tell @realDonaldTrump that the effect of an all-caps tweet is lost on people who don't use the Latin alphabet.  SAD! #trump #iran #diplomacy https://t.co/oL21QOAlLE

@JohnCornyn Then why haven‚Äôt you presented a bill that does those three things?
@RickSaccone4PA There‚Äôs always a degree of alarmism in the news, but that‚Äôs not necessarily a bad thing with hurricanes.  Also, I recommend dismissing your reliance on Saffir-Sampson and looking at precipitation forecasts and accumulated cyclone energy when determining the threat of a storm.
@GovMikeHuckabee @realDonaldTrump I guess your network ‚Äúlost its mojo‚Äù ten years ago.  Anyone else remember this? https://t.co/n6CGgK7yLp
@GOPChairwoman @realDonaldTrump Let‚Äôs remember @realDonaldTrump is the guy who said he met with the president of the US Virgin Islands, not knowing that he met with the governor and that he himself is literally the president of the U.S. Virgin Islands
@RickSaccone4PA @realDonaldTrump There‚Äôs someone in the White House actively working against the president you support, but the real bad guys are the ones who told us it was happening. #oksure
@SecretaryZinke @RepGosar This is definitely an interesting take on the concept of a wildlife refuge
@KeithRothfus The number of bills passed is an arbitrary measure of productivity. The 39th Congress only passed 435 acts, but it approved the 14th amendment. This is like McDonald‚Äôs claiming to be the best restaurant because they‚Äôve served the most hamburgers. #contentmatters https://t.co/rrUn2T3Zyk
@LouDobbs @SidneyPowell1 @realDonaldTrump George Bush Sr. said of @realDonaldTrump "I know he's a blowhard".  Selective outrage?
