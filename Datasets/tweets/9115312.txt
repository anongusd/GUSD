I once saw a twitter app that had the screen divided into 6 (9?) boxes & tracked keywords you chose in real time anyone know the name of it?

Tonight on the square one of the balloon people was arguing with another "street" person over the food & the box it came in.
@kolson29 SDT guys are the guys who clean the Quarter. "Sydney X Torres." Don't know the owner's middle name! LOL
@kolson29 Strange as it is!
I might even make an effort to be (mostly) sober. tee hee. j/k.
Maybe I'll learn to tie balloons. I'd be the only female talking to kids on the square, which, judging from parents tonight is a plus.
Had a strange night with the balloon people on the square. SDT guys & I had a laugh together. Drama. And fun.

@lizmoney tee hee. maybe Nagin will sympathize.
@s0ni huh? really? moving? to jeff parish?
@s0ni WTH for?
@TheJLV Heyyyy friend! How's it going? Ready for summer yet?
For example, Franks on Decatur has already lasted 8 months. *Only* because of its Decatur street location. BR would have sent it packing.
Don't get me wrong, NOLA is the *reason* BR is so good, the Mecca & standard, but Baton Rougeans eat well.
Whereas, I've found some truly bad places in NOLA, even in my limited eating out experience. And I wasn't used to that in BR.
Theory: It's impossible to find a bad restaurant in Baton Rouge b/c there are *no* tourists in BR, and every Baton Rougean has been to NOLA
@nezalicious Can I come to eat at your father's house? ;)
The last best Mexican food I had was in Baton Rouge, which I still contend has some kick-ass food, despite what New Orleanians say.
@lizmoney Maybe we should petition Nagin for my car! lol
@lizmoney LOL. someday the city will give up my car & I'll visit those places. :-p
@GentillyGirl Yup. Can't disagree w/ that!
All I know is I ate tex-mex ALL MY LIFE. Tex mex is to me what food is to normal people.
BUT: I paid them a few minutes ago.... so that's over.... and the sour cream sauce aside, it really does rock.
My two complaints: They said there would be sour cream sauce on my enchiladas, and there isn't. Plus, it's more expensive than it should be.
I'm a native Texan. It's sad how picky I am about "mexican" food.
I could'a gone to Las Palmas in Baton Rouge & ordered the same thing much cheaper...
I am in no way a "foodie." But I'm really picky about "Mexican" food. Just paid $45 for take out @ El Gato Negro. Here's hoping....
@blondie80 His understanding of menstruation? Wmn are punished w/ menstruation because of sex. and *how* many preggers @ our school, again?

For long-time readers: I had another mini-vagina lecture today. One boy(!) had a completely FUCKED understanding of menstruation. set right
@antirealism Ha! I'll take third-hand love. They set a fire again today @ school!
My computer went kaput. Totally black & nothing on screen at all. No start up. Not happy at all.
@jungle_goddess awwww. Thanks, hon. *hugs*
@sadcox was wondering. seems like there's *no* activity on Qwitter forever, then everyone quits @ once. not sending them when they happen?
About 18 hours ago I said "@liprap LOL. Conditions apply." That lost me about 15 followers. =) why does everyone Quit on me @ once?

@liprap I'd be *effing* thrilled if we had some notebook paper. And, no, the kids do not bring it to school.

@antirealism And making sure never to make the mistake of getting "just a little bit" of water from the founatin for the watercolor pencils
@tshumbie and I used to be good at "classroom management"

@antirealism And super unfortuante that I'm just glad I'm not the only one.
*just, even.
@shercole isn't @theJLV jusy dreamy?
There are days I seriously stand in the classroom & "realize" (again) that my presence doesn't matter. The goings on wld be the same w/o me.
@s0ni U still outta town this weekend?
I'm to a point where I feel the best help I can be is to help a few students find placement in a better school next year. Sad.
So mad at my third period I'm trying not to think about it.
OK, I guess it's bedtime now that the kitchen's a wreck. If you see me on twitter tomorrow, shoo me away... I gotta clean this house!
@liprap LOL. I wish you'd come around my twitter world sooner! Probably too late for me!
@tshumbie Perrier!!!
@lisaheindel I know, right? It's like that. I never see "normal" stores anymore. But I only really miss 'em every few months. Minor deal.
@tshumbie nitie night!
@overflowinbrain I know. I do the same thing for no reason! That's what I say... WTF?
More than any other store, though, I'd like to go to Ross.
@tshumbie been advised to go there before! Must make a run. =) I've really become a Quarter Rat. I hardly ever leave & D's is where? China?
@tshumbie I didn't even stop to look, as we were on lunch break, in and out. But I was dizzy just seeing so many wine bottles in a row...
@overflowinbrain The sleep thing does it for me. Sodas & pepto, not so much.... but sleeping is mission critical.
That big Rouses' on Carrolton has a space the size of my apartment just for wine. *drool*

@GentillyGirl LOL. making groceries! I just use my little bicycle.... tee hee. Call or tweet me when u make a run to Wal Mart or Sam's! :-p
@Pontchartrain Oh yes, but every time we go there they're out of GRITS!!!
@YatPundit Husbands are good that way!
@tshumbie I haven't eaten yet. I'm so disgusted from handling raw food... I'm waiting... lol
@GentillyGirl If you compare the prices of groceries @ Rouses' on Royal, and takeout in the Quarter it's about =. But homecooking is good!
@GentillyGirl He cooks waaayyyy more than me. But lately we've been taking out too much!
The upside of being a wife who doesn't cook: He's happy with anything he gets. :-p. Quartermaster call is, narrowly, averted.
@GentillyGirl I seriously might. With a cheesy, greasy spatula.
Hubby says, "I'm about to call the Quarter Master." Like that's funny.
I almost felt like a real wife, you know w/ ingredients & shit, but the pizza boxes are still stacked by the trash can frm the weekend party
@YatPundit You sound like my husband! But I always go for the icy Cuervo!
The meat: Lea & Perrins, egg, bread crumbs, pepper, garlic powder, onion & tony's. Whatever was recommended that i had. too much? we'll see!
@GentillyGirl Should check that out, as Margaritas are a must!
@lisaheindel I'm blending bread to make bread crumbs at the advice of @tshumbie. So far, great advice.
I thought blenders were for margaritas!
Wow. My blender works much better with bread than ice!
@whynot88 what about actual onion? diced? don't think I have the other kind....
@Im_X1 Aren't u supposed to put an egg? Or no?
@tshumbie I will. Have been keeping my distance, though. So glad u said that!
@SylviaDiscount Exactly! It filled the whole hallway!
OK, so trying, in a rare moment, to be domestic. What do you put in hamburger meat before stuffing it w/ mozz. cheese & making a burger?

Many thanks to Jose Cuervo for help in coming to this conclusion. :-p

@s0ni BTW, I want u to meet my friend dawn the weekend of the 26th.

@s0ni I love that new profile pic! what party was that?
In the website for getting a sub in this district, one of the drop-down choices for "reason for absence" is ASSAULT. Seriously.
@sevenlies awwwwww. You'll settle into that quiet married contentment soon enough!
@tshumbie ah ha. hmmmm. thanks. Seems like Nagin is trying to paint happiness on his contract awards tho. *All* bidders were black.
Why are black-owned businesses considered "minority owned" in terms of Nagin's awarding contracts when NOLA is 67% black?
@kolson29 bottle up some of that new baby smell, will ya?
Beautiful day outside. But I'm still sick. Can't breathe.
Just realized today is Pi day.

There's a leak in our kitchen that a structural engineer and a plumber have both said is *impossible.* And yet.....
I find myself a big fan of technology in the classroom in the *abstract.* But when I actually have to teach new computer skills... *shudder*
@Akula Did you tweet the same thing three times on purpose?
Sleepiness is driving me to the bed. I'm drove. Night, all!
@tshumbie Only 6 in class is interesting really, b/c they all expect instant help. Usually that's ok, but today there were 'puter problems.
@tshumbie In that situation they were right. Everyone was asking me stuff at the same time & getting flustered. only 6 in that class, too
@Kichigai Exactly.
@tshumbie That, but being "drove," from the usage indicates external forces are driving you, "driven" typically means internal ambition.
Apparently, being "drove" is different from being "driven." hmmm
Today a student said, "Mrs. S. you drove" (as in you *are* drove). Whaaa?, says I? "You let people drive you." Hmmmmm. very true.
@shercole awwwwwwwwww a twitter crush. how cute!
@mayaREguru Hubby is exaggerating, of course. He just thinks it's a bad idea. He will come around, though.
@tshumbie Oh, there's a twitscape? I didn't know. What is he saying?
@dan_munz oh my. What a fascist! LOL
@MAVinBKK because my husband has a mind made for Mad TV.
@YatPundit OMG. rofl. no answer, just lol.
@tshumbie Had not thought of that. (the social worker, that is)
@tshumbie You're right. I just hope she lets this make her stronger!
Hubby thinks if I go to NY to meet ppl I met on the internet I'll end up chloroformed in Bangkok, handcuffed to a radiator.
Why does this make her so angry? Many kids have nobody in their corner @ that school. More imp. how can I help her?
@dmcordell You know, why shouldn't I? I'll be off school......... what airport is that anyway?
@dmcordell Early June = summer! lol. I'll be envying you then!

@s0ni OMG you are hilarious! Get out quick.
@s0ni LOL. Where are you? What are you watching?
@BlondeByDesign True, but sometimes the original phrasing us the *reason* for the re-tweet. Usually, even, for me.
Background song on the cell phone commercial seems to indicate that purchasing a cell phone is the way to celebrate life. hmmm
Personally, I would think the original writer is the only one that needs to be in there, but don't want to offend. So sometimes I don't RT
What do you do when you want to Re-Tweet a Re-Tweet? And how far back does the homage go?

@YatPundit Actually, I've taken many cabs to Shar-tres. I think they just want their money.
I have no problem with burGUNdie, though. I guess that seems like a strictly pronunciation issue rather than a phonetic one.
@YatPundit Yeah, I knew about Chartres. Preception is new to me. But I will ALWAYS say Shar-tres and PERception. I'll always be a transp ...

Rumor says someone was circling this campus looking for someone, to shoot them. So all stay inside till guy is caught. This from another ...
Nobody can approach the builing. Nobody can go in or out of the building, even to get lunch from the caf. Sharing goldfish crackers now.
The "buzz" is that it's quite serious and centered around our school. don't know how true. but an 8 blk radius around our school is bloc ...
We need lunch!
Kids are supposed to be released for lunch, but just got another announcement to ignore the bell.
Wish I had a police scanner radio. Must get one of those.
@tshumbie Yeah, me either. And I checked crime & safety & Treme forums on nola.com. Still ongoing though, as of now.
Wish I knew what was going on. Anyone know what the criminal activity is in the Treme neighborhood near Derbigny/N.Roman?
School on lockdown due to criminal activity in the neighborhood. No planning period this whole week, also.
Our mayor is passive aggressive.
Sometimes I see myspace layouts and think, "This person is blind. There is no other explanation."
Serves Starbucks right for opening too damn many stores in the first place.
@LeBomba I did go to the original one in Seattle. Yay me. But CC's is just around the corner on Royal.
i don't know. i don't. i don't even know where there is one. but there are clearly too many of them in the world! lol
Closure of 300 Starbucks stores? So we'll have to walk an extra block to get to one.
I need to get a T-Shirt that says, "Yes. I am tripping." Maybe that way it won't seem necessary for students to tell me all the time!

I'm sleepy. Good lawd. Only a 3 day week & I'm ready 4 the weekend.
@benweaver Because they don't have any! lol
@lizmoney I won't ask how you happened on those! lol.
@dmcordell The upside is, I look 33!
2 girls asked me today: How old are you, 33?  Me: 37.  Them: Wooooooooohhhhh. Those four years really put me over the hill to them!
@tshumbie Report cards. I call home when I can, but many have no accurate phone numbers. Frt ofc is working on that now.
Just saw a commercial for a horror film w/ lady getting strangled w/ a string of pearls. Wouldn't the pearls give way before the trachea?
@niedzi Most students in my classes take even their classwork as a buffet option.They ~sometimes~ let me explain it, then decide yay or nay.
@curbxstomp You are a genius! =) Be happy! Those are great scores.
The answer is ONE. One mother with her child. And two hours of doing other work. They should just call it a teacher work evening.
@blondie80 Turns out yesterday's evacuation wsn't a fire, it ws a kid pulling the fire alarm. Today's was b/c someone played w/ extinguisher
@c3ane @bleckley NOPE! ONE WHOLE PARENT!
Guess how many parents showed up for parent's night? Just guess.
OK, I really am going to sleep now. Nitie night.
Oh yeah. I almost forgot. There was another fire today.
Thanks everyone for the chat. I'm going to sleep now. Parent's night tomorrow!
@tshumbie Their school uniforms are these gray dickies. They look like prison outfits to me.
@tshumbie opps? does that stand for orleans parish prison system? because i say ALL THE TIME this is more like a prison than a school
@tshumbie Sorry to be negative. =(
@tshumbie It's going horrible. I get name-called and back-talked at least every half hour. I may take you up on that!
@dmcordell I don't think this one is w/o conscience since he turned himself in.
@tshumbie My first year in new orleans and this school. Before that I taught at a suburban school in South Carolina.
@dmcordell Exactly. It's like a game to them.
@tshumbie lol. maybe! other teachers said they get 1 or 2 parents on parent night, generally speaking.
@tshumbie Are you retired now, or working elsewhere?
Tomorrow night is parents night. oh. joy.
@tshumbie Awful. When did you teach there? Recently? I'm curious whether you think nola schools have improved ~as superintendent says~
@petrock MY GOD what are these kids thinking?
@BlueTeddy I just hope some of the other students wake up & realize.
@tshumbie I guess I'm seeing that now.
@caderoux What freaks me out about it is his mom got him to turn himself in. So there's some parental guidance in his life.
@petrock Strange. Was he high? Mentally ill?
@nsingman Thank you.
@charlotteAsh Sure. You're probably right. I wonder if he even knew he was capable of that.
@BlueTeddy No. There is no excuse. He is absolutely wrong. Not saying there's an excuse. It's just sad he became this person.
I mean, MY students are coming to MY neighborhood & KILLING PEOPLE. Good lord. How am I supposed to deal with that?
@TheJLV Thanks.
@petrock You saw that happen? Horrible.
@charlotteAsh I know. You're right. It's just weird b/c he wasn't a killer when I was helping him with English just 5 days ago.
@BlueTeddy It really is. Everyone in the Quarter is so mad about the woman who died, myself included. But I'm sick for Reggie too. torn
@dmcordell And I wonder... will this make them think about it twice?
@dmcordell I'm worried about what the kids will be saying, feeling, thinking tomorrow. I hear violence every day around there.
@dmcordell Horrible.
@BlueTeddy Yeah, they're trying him as an adult.
@patrickd88 I won't. I can't. But I wish I could.
I'm sad for the woman who was killed and her family. But I'm also sad that my student did this. And I'm angry at him.
I don't know how to feel about this. My student committed a murder. He's 15. He killed and his life is over. I don't want to go in tomorrow
@datgirldimps I am serious. They said his name on the five o'clock news. Reggie Douglas. He's in 2 of my classes. I worked w/ him Friday.
Makes me afraid to work there, to be honest. He was in my class Friday and then went Saturday to the FQ "to rob ppl" - and shot a woman
One of the students in the FQ shooting is in my class. I saw him friday.
@poshmama As a sign of the times?
No matter who is president, we have to have a formal gun viewing.
Cox cam an hour and a half late, in the middle of Obama's speech, but at least they came.
@damian613 @lbilak No school. RSD called today a holiday a couple of weeks ago. Yay us!
A toast to BHO & whatever comes next for us. May it be excellent.
I have a shot of Wild Turkey ready for when he takes the oath. There ya go. That's my celebration.
@kusdiva OH, good. I'm a stickler for these kinds of details. Thanks for telling me. It was bugging me.
WHAT? musical performance? they have 45 seconds to noon.
3 minutes to go
What are they going to do about the delay? They have to swear him in at 12 regardless of plans, right?
To clarify: My legs are in my sweatpants. My computer isn't. lol
@bigcat48 lol! Oh that was funny!
There are soooooooooo many people there. I'm glad to be watching w/ my computer in my sweatpants. Where it's warm.
@WetBankGuy Yeah. We LSU fans are tres rude.
And there's the new president.
People who bother booing the former president at a moment like this are just ruining it. This isn't the superbowl.
I'd hate to be Barack right now. Much pressure for a perfect speech.
@cburell When you're a Bush you don't have to do anything. One example: Neil Bush.

@shercole Yeah. I friended u. check your Twitter DMs
Oh, cute little Obama girls! They look happy.
@shercole yes fb
Bill Clinton is mad because he wanted to be the first gigolo.
@ricksanchezcnn Could you please explain to your people what LIVE means?
@shercole Does that mean talking in real or online? lol
I can't say I'm surprised, but Cox didn't show up.
OMG that lady that was shot in the French Quarter worked at the Starlight. Did @GentillyGirl know her?
CNN puts the word "live" on top of coverage I already saw on CSPAN. Can CSPAN see the future or is CNN full of crap? hmmm
@datgirldimps What's up with local authorities?
Why is Dick Cheney in a wheelchair?
@shercole how? just by using @ in your update? I wonder if they can see it.
@giobigez I thought I knew the word "matar" - which is what made me notice it. But I can't tell what the person was saying. ugh
This CNN facebook thing would be better if we could reply to each other.
@datgirldimps He was on CSPAN yesterday with Rhee and others in DC in an "inaugural discussion" about schools. & he pissed me off.
Saw this on facebook, can someone translate? is ojala los francotiradores que van a matar a obama no le den.
@datgirldimps I guess only the RSD took off because Vallas wanted the day off so he could schmooze w/ the politicos in DC. lol
Number one used word on facebook & twitter besides "obama" = "historic" - according to me.
CSPAN is talking about the students around the country watching the inaug. New Orleans took the day off school!
@niedzi Obama can't make mistakes! Didn't you hear he's perfect? lol
Re-tweeting from Facebook status: Nick Clucas is we got a black president now, tupac can come out form his grandma's basement finally!
RT @bun_ebombshell  I wonder what Barack is saying to George right now..."You know you fucked up right?"
@niedzi They have already said they were coming two other days. Third time's a charm I hope. grrr to these people.
I am waiting once again for Cox Communications to come fix this messed up, unreliable connection. This is the third time this month.
@dmcordell Did you go to China for the Olympics, btw?
@dmcordell But new ones are coming. Just don't know when. I mean it's only Janurary 20. But thy still need to fix electrial & wireless prob
@dmcordell Lol! We have epic machines, which are so crappy. The big problem is no wireless for any of em. But many just don't boot at all.
Watching inauguration stuff on CSPAN.
This is funny: http://www.safenow.org/
@dmcordell Not only do I expect them to work, I expect the Superintendent to stop lying about it on CSPAN for his own political carer. lol
Today Paul Vallas said on CSPAN that all New Orleans high schoolers have laptops. Interesting. In my classes we have them: they don't work
Desperate Housewives is more realistic than the bullshit these school board types are spouting on channel 8. Fuck 'em.
Just in case you were wondering if cable guy showed up to deal w/ French Quarter parking on a Sat. night, the answer is no. twice in 2 wks.
@LeBomba Nope. No show.
This blowhard on channel 8 is making me sick.
Waiting for the cable guy to come fix our internet (again). Wondering if he'll actually show this time.
A bare google search for "New Orleans" is pretty disappointing.
It's not an exaggeration to say that my whole day went better because I rode my bike to work.
Must try to get some rest now. It's a school night!
@s0ni I agree with @shercole. Let's see it.
@s0ni I thought it was funny & clever! lol. I didn't know it was a manifestation of OCD. You might wanna see someone about that! tee hee
@jungle_goddess You're sweet! =)
@Pontchartrain How is it? I read that story & loved it, but never saw the film for fear of disappointment.
@YatPundit And now I'm going to have to look up what that could possibly mean. yikes. on second thought...
@YatPundit it won't be the first time! you should see some of the search results I get. Makes me afraid for society. lol
Aren't ya'll so proud of me for changing my profile picture, finally? I mean, it's only been about 20 days since Christmas.
@cburell Watching that weakens the nation. it also causes brain & eye cancer, and other stuff too horrible to mention.
Used the word "orgies" on blog. Will now get google search visitors for the term "teacher orgies"
@niedzi The Golden Globe awards reminded me of it.
@DickManly ha! that's the best one.
@YatPundit None. And that's why I love you! lol
Funny thing, nobody asked why on earth I'd want to know!
@TheJLV yes. i do. lol
Wow. Six replies in two minutes in response to a question about orgies.
New blog post: In Re: Golden Globe Awards http://tinyurl.com/7p4cqu

I'm going to have to bug out of the online scene during Golden Globes. ugh.

@LeBomba Between that and the brownie batter, we'll all know what happened if I get sick....
@LeBomba Dunno. It was shrimp fettuccini from the grocery store deli. Sounds ominous, huh?
@paininthenet eeeewwwwwwwwwww
I heard you shouldn't eat brownie batter because of salmonella in the eggs. But I always did it before. And it's really yummy.
These shrimp taste weird.

I'm so susceptible to advertising ~which is why i try to avoid it i guess~ saw an Ad w/ 8 Mile in it & am now watching it.
@Pistachio It's probably many mice.
Hubby had to work, but he'll be home any minute. Later we're going to try to find something open in the Qtr & maybe take a carriage ride.
@Kichigai Ummm, I don't know what hulk hands are, but I can surmise it's a fun game. sounds like a great day!
@jungle_goddess Glad to hear it! Christmas is a great day.
@kusdiva I got out and walked around the quarter. Got out of my pj's for that. Otherwise, back in 'em ASAP.
Oh, yeah. It's 73 degrees on Christmas Day. I love this.
Merry Christmas! How's everyone's day been so far?
There's a whistling kind of music I've never before heard in the Quarter. Very sweet. Foggy night. Can't see any of the downtown bldgs
@YatPundit Good night. Merry Christmas!
Bells at St. Louis Cathedral chiming for midnight mass. It's Christmas Day!
I changed my twitter avatar using Twixenate at http://url.ie/z82
@YatPundit You shouldn't crush a girl's image of Santa on Christmas eve! lol
@YatPundit That must be why he was never spotted in Nola!
Santa Claus is in Alexandria now! He's getting close to us.
@TKPope I feel much better about your safety, my friend, now that I know you have "Skidoosh" in your arsenal.
@Gloson That card is so cute! Thx for sharing. Merry Christmas.
@TKPope That panda in your profile pic looks pretty fierce. Like he might swallow you whole.
@Bloggeries I signed up earlier today & got an @reply a little later.
@davehull So exciting! Looks great!
Does NORAD have a twitter account for santa?
45 minutes till Christmas!
I loved this review of Valkyrie because it's always good to see Tom Cruise skillfully cracked on: http://tinyurl.com/7sk7ek
@markdavidson Working to meet client demands on Christmas Eve! Bah Humbug!
@donlemoncnn Merry Christmas to all and to all a good night.
There's a leak somewhere in the building spilling water into some of the lower floors. Nobody knows where it is coming from. it's xmas eve
The Fidelity Bank and Trust is a tough creditor. You make a deposit somewhere else, they close your account. Forever.
Jack Campbell says, "We'll get a funnel cake! It'll be the highlight of my week!"
Does anyone else consider Family Man w/ Nick Cage to be mandatory holiday fare?
@linnetwoods Man, I always just miss the quiz! What kind of teacher am I?
@dmcordell Love that ornament. Can I come to your house soon? I need more Adirondack in my life. For a while.
@dmcordell For some frustrating reason that I'm sure is related to my move to new orleans, I can't load that flickr page. It's cox's fault.
@dmcordell If hubby sells ornaments, I'd like to see some options....
and what if i said i learned that lesson from prayer, with some help from good writers??
my interest in green living really got its spark when i learned about how it affects real people. not plants trees or animals.
@dmcordell ALL IN for an ornament deal. I &lt;3 ornaments. I tell myself every yr that I'm gonna make ornaments frm lst year's xmas cards.
Now, that's not an excuse for ugly-ass tacky, ornaments. Mom still lives in me. They don't have to match, but the have to not suck.
Because nothing beats ornaments that combine with memories. That MAKES a tree.
Mom was a "designed" tree kind of gal. All ornaments match. I have a nice base now from silver, red, & white b/c of her, but am moving on.
@jungle_goddess Every year I go through the explanation of the ornaments several times. I &lt;3 it.
I've only recently realized that a really beautiful Christmas ornament is the best gift.
Does it make sense to say that although I still feel "slow" I'm less out of synch since I've moved to New Orleans?
I like ALL my ornaments, but I had several like this one. Shew. Must reinforce ornament security measures.
The wind is whipping through the house. An ornament fell. I paused & had a deep breath before looking to see which one.
@TheJLV Anyway, Merry Christmas!
@TheJLV Well, if it's any kind of serious, I'd say it belongs on his wikipedia page, but I don't see it there.
@TheJLV I thought probably, but I'm not finding it easily. It must be pretty old, or pretty well handled by PR guys, or I'm pretty dumb.
Wondering, for no good reason, whether Ice Cube has a criminal record. Will Google.
@jungle_goddess Just don't put any on your face! ~unless u already have one there, then I'm soooo sorry~
@charlotteAsh This weather is pretty cool! Merry Christmas.
@jungle_goddess How many tattoos? I am just not a fan, in general. But this chick has them all over her thighs. Hard to see her.
@TheJLV LOL LOL LOL! I KNEW you would respond to that! Haven't heard from Jose in days? mention breasts! ha ha ha
I've never looked at an image of a human nude & thought, "man that body would be perfect if someone would draw a picture on it."
The day, not the girl, btw. But I guess she's pretty cute too. Too many tattoos.
Speaking of breasts.... there's a girl on a balcony below me in a bikini. It's pretty hot for Christmas Eve.
That would, of course, include discussion of breasts.
I might start a whole new twitter account to discuss bras & related things. That would be fun.
@nsingman Believe me, I think about it on a regular basis. But there's the issue of breast saggage.....
@terrifik oranges? hummmmmm.
I am back home and bra-less and intend to stay so until at least 9 pm tonight. Yay!
Well, my bra and I are going to the grocery store! Later!
@shercole Exactly. And that saggy ass paneling they put in tank tops doesn't count!
Worst part about leaving the house: putting on a bra. When are we going to innovate the bra experience? There are 10K kinds of toothbrushes.
@shercole I'm having a pretty good time so far. Have forgotten all about work. So that's good!
@shercole Hey, shercole! How's your holiday so far?
@datgirldimps It's probably a sinus headache. Take some sudafed PE
Hubby is working today and doesn't get off till 7. Then we're going to go see what's shakin' in the Qtr. Any suggestions?
@wirldwyde Wait.... what did I miss? Sounds good.
I cannot believe it's already Christmas Eve!
@chrisbrogan I think you bare your soul because she does.
There really aren't enough excuses to eat salsa.
@Pontchartrain lol. both, i guess!
@Documentally Yeah, I don't think you're alone in this.
@Documentally What is "Trumping"? Is it what it sounds like?
@WorldHarmony I don't know where I picked that up. Sounds kinda snotty.
@Pontchartrain That puts an odd picture in my head. :P
What makes a pant a "trouser"?
@lbilak Cheers from NOLA! Merry Christmas!
tied 5-5 so far.
Bryan and I are watching Jeopardy & keeping score.
@linnetwoods Have you gotten much work there?
@SarahInMI oh noes! lol
@SarahInMI I've done that a couple of times too. Yikes.
@linnetwoods I saw on your site that you are oDesk certified. How did you do that? Was it expensive?
@linnetwoods Mark Twain
But the "how to use mail" class should come second after "how to put out fires" I guess.
@bun_ebombshell Then everyone that replies hits "reply all" -- I want to hold a "how to use email" professional development session. lol
@bun_ebombshell I couldn't agree more. My boss gets an email, frwrds to his secretary saying "send to staff" so it comes to us 3rd hand.
So it seems to me we should be careful about what we tear down, what we build or refuse to build. Very complex & interesting stuff.
Assuming humanity doesn't destroy itself & NOLA is still standing, 100 years from now the post-K era will be monumental 2 this city.
@YatPundit Of course.
Or is that obvious?
I wonder if the sudden banning of the MidCity bonfire has something to do w/ breaking the community spirit in prep for the hospital.
@YatPundit Well, I wish them luck.
@YatPundit The hospital thing and now the bonfire thing? I'd be pissed.
@shercole That too. I don't think they pay any attention at all to New Orleans east until there's a murder.
It seems like the city of NOLA is constantly shitting on mid-city.
@plagiarismtoday Yeah. It will be okay. I just got out of the habit of moving the car on Tues & Thur when I started working out of the Qtr.
@TKPope sad. funny, but sad. :)
@plagiarismtoday I am so mad at myself right now about it. AAAHHHH
I seriously cannot believe I forgot they were cleaning the streets today. I'm such an idiot. Car = towed. Again. How dumb can I be?
@officemate Everything is better with bacon! Having trouble playing the large & lovely tho.
@preppiecurler Which? Opening presents early, or eating king cake early? Because we've done both!
@blondie80 That's just what we do. :)
@WillyB No. Just seen it about a zillion times.
@linnetwoods Stay warm! Goodnight!
This recipe warns the baker not to make the cake before Jan. 6. http://tinyurl.com/aw2aa
@WillyB The real Roberts is retired and living like a king in Patagonia.
@djpoptart I agree with your comfort food observation. I'm certainly feeling comforted.
@lbilak Yes I know, I know. I will never eat king cake early again.
@NOLAnotes Sounds like fun!
@YatPundit are those anchovies?
@lbilak I think they eat 'em more often than that down here. :)
@blondie80 OMG, mine has to go shopping again b/c we opened 2 & I bought my ipod myself.
@YatPundit Go daddy! pizza!
Wiipedia image says: "The plastic baby usually inside the cake has been removed for clarity." My cake was quite clear, too.
But beignet put up a worthy fight.
King cake kicks beignets' ass.
@YatPundit No, it's the plain, tiny, faceless one. Boo.
@YatPundit I thought that was stupid. But I am loving the cake.
@YatPundit Is there another one inside?
@YatPundit So glad u said that b/c I wasn't going to be able to resist saying that it really is soooo good. But why's the baby on top?
@WillyB Fessick, are there rocks ahead?
Did I stir up something bad? tee hee. Sorry. I promise never again. ;)
Maybe they're just desperate to make a sale.... things are hard, I guess. rouses, i mean.
@ticktock6 Oh..... you said the magic word. Cox FYYFF.
@ticktock6 That is just wrong.
@lbilak Merry Christmas to you, too! I've missed ya!
The best thing about my World Aids Day for Africa shirt I bought at the Gap today? other than the sale price: it has a pocket 4 my new ipod.
I hereby promise, on my king cake, never to eat #kingcake before Twelfth Night again. Amen. Play ball.
Just read Ashley Morris's Fuck you You Fucking Fucks post. OMG. !!! :)
@Im_X1 AND I'm glad you told me about the Streetcar thing on 12th night. I will! Yay! I've had more fun in NOLA this week than ever so far.
@Im_X1 That's funny. I ate king cake in Baton Rouge all the time, but as I'm so not catlick, as &Yatpundit says, I never knew all that stuff
@tgardner I like that!
I know I could look up the king cake thing, and I'm sure I will, but it's more fun to hear it from the indigenous people.
@YatPundit @lm_X1 @lisaheindel I didn't know there was a rule about King cakes. Please enlighten. What's up w/ that?
@tgardner I wasn't sure if you meant fireworks!
@dmcordell No, I think they're starting Mardi Gras early like they do everything else.
@YatPundit Does that rule still apply if you haven't had any at all in 6 years? or can I get a pass this one time? tee hee
@YatPundit Why?
@Im_X1 My king cake is from rouse's and it's cream cheese. Not voting for or against. Haven't had king cake in 6 years.
@tgardner do you mean fireworks? or champagne? or something else?
Oh, yeah. Plus red wine & Abita Christmas Ale.
Hubby is making his spaghetti. The house is clean. The tree is lit. The presents are bought, and there's king cake in the kitchen. Heaven.
@kevinhendricks I've always thought the Jubilee year was a great idea. The once-in-a-lifetime chance to start over.
I have been trying to learn the words to Akwid's Te Extrano for about a year and a half. Still don't have it all.
@Pontchartrain Thanks. Maybe we'll go see that Monday....
@lisaheindel For sure. I'm only about 3 blocks from it, so it'd be a crime not to walk down there.
What else Christmas-y should I see while I'm off work?
@KevinKolb Glad I didn't miss it! :)
@lisaheindel Yay! Are you going?
Is tonight the night they sing chrismas carols in the square?
@s0ni How is cat?
Oh, and have discovered that teachers in New Orleans are sooooo much more fun than bible belt teachers. Went to Cat's Meow last night.
Playing Majong in front of the Christmas tree. Couldn't be happier to be doing nothing. But can't seem to win one.
@s0ni Showed It's a Wonderful Life to my students. The ones that were patient enough to pay attention to the story liked it. But few were.
@NOLAnotes I like it too, but I like It's a Wonderful Life more.
I can't believe TBS is doing 24 straight hours of a Christmas Story. Unimaginative? Ridiculous? Or do you like it that much?
@djpoptart hmmm. a name. I'll have to think about that!
I finally got a new iPod! YAY!
Very sorry for all the people who are dealing with this big winter storm!
Twenty three minutes and I can get out of these bleachers!

This kid has been using his drum sticks to bang on the wall beside me for about 30 minutes. How long till I can use his head as a drum?
@patrickd88 I finally got it. You know you haven't blogged in a long time when you forget how to log in. :)
@Pontchartrain OHHHH I forgot "wordpress" Ahhh. thanks.
@etherjammer yup. 404
I did login.php and admin.php but am getting a 404 page. I wonder WTF? grrrr
@sadcox Well, I'm alive. My internetz is down. fuck cox cable. Anyway. Most students are good. Some are jerks. So, situation normal.
What's the wordpress extension thing that goes @ end of url for logging in? I thought it was taylortheteacher.com/wp-login.php ??
@skydaddy some are, some aren't. Good days and bad. So, pretty much normal (except for fights & arson)
@PreppyDude Well, the school was set on fire today. Now we're all in the gym. It's way stinky in here. Lots of b-ball. And kiddos.
@terrifik cox sux. that's it. they sux
And the fire lady said there were 2 or 3 other schools on fire today. Why doesn't the picayunne report this?
Then, went into the gym, where we are imprisoned until 4:30. While we were "evacuated" there were 2 fights.
OK, so, someone set the school on fire again today. Smoke billowed out of the first floor. Stood in the sun for 1.5 hours.
My internet @ home isn't working properly. That's why I've been gone. Just in case you missed me.
Hello twitterverse. Don't know why the filter @ school isn't working, but am making the most of it.
Roach is dead. Crisis averted! Now going to sleep so I can try to well up! good night!
@kissmygumbo I can tell it's working already!
@lisaheindel I looked it up but got some kind of singer, then looked harder. Now I see.
Prediction: Hubby will wonder at why I have the windows and doors open & bitch that it's. It's 71, but the wind is blowing.
@bsicomics lol. I don't know who Gregor Samsa is, but he's not responding to fucker, so it can't hurt...
@lisaheindel This roach has had many, many chocolate pralines.
I'm thinking a bit of a chocolate praline from Aunt Sally will make my throat feel better. Yeah. Probably.
The roach doesn't seem to be fazed by me calling him a fucker. Hubby will be home soon, and that fucker will die.
@iTH13RTEEN I'd say the same about vista. But I don't know anything about ubuntu.
@bleckley Or was that a joke? A CATFISH? That's a pretty big cockroach.
@cecilyhayes I'd be upset too. I love kittehs. :(
@bleckley awww, how sad!
@terrilynnh I hope it's dead. It's on the highest part of the wall, near the ceiling. So if it's dead, its feet are sticking to the wall.
@lindseak Count me in on the Orwell!
@lisaheindel oh. my feelings about south carolina are showing i guess... but roaches are worse, i agree.
@cecilyhayes That's sad. I'm sorry. :"(
@lisaheindel But wait... we have some of that here. At least we live in New Orleans. And it's not cold.
@mariebeausoleil That you would make me go back to the freezing cold!
@SistersTalk It's bad for you... that's why the drizzly sweet dipping sauce MAKES them! worth the extra workout!
@lisaheindel what, hate south carolina? What's to hate? Confederate veteran's day? Dixie pride? KKK?
@liprap "They" were insane. That makes my skin crawl!
@mariebeausoleil Hell no! I won't go! tee hee
@SistersTalk Do they come with the drizzly sweet dipping sauce? yum.
In South Carolina they'd cancel after-school practices for rain. I just laughed and laughed.
71 degrees in New Orleans.
The roach hasn't moved. Just so you know.
@lisaheindel I was wondering why you would ask that! lol
Man, the wind is really kicking up!
@lisaheindel I live on the 4th floor in the Qtr. Quite high up.
@lisaheindel I remember the relatively mild temps, but I don't remember winter humidity. Probably didn't notice till I went to dry SC.
@lisaheindel I lived in Baton Rouge for 13 years, but I had such FREEZING winters in South Carolina I think I forgot.
@terrilynnh And I'm glad she's still in school.
@terrilynnh I just hope she doesn't take it too far. ya know?
@lisaheindel Is this typical for December here?
@lisaheindel Doesn't it feel oddly humid for December, though?
Last night I discovered via facebook that one of my former students is posing for playboy. sigh. she's a grown up. but not to me.
@cplautz I'm loving the Absolut world already!
@daddyclaxton That's weird. I'm hot. Not extremely hot, but it's humid, humid, humid. I don't miss snow, though....
@shercole I need to look into gettin me some side hustles. Maybe I'm too old to change my ways.... naw....
@shercole If I could get Matthew Mcconaughey I'd keep him 4 myself, then I wouldn't need u to entertain me on twitter! lol
@shercole i had thought your business was entertaining me on twitter! lol
@shercole purdy good. going to bed early, trying to ward off a cold. what's your business? i just realized i don't even know!
@shercole Good evening.... where'd you go? Anywhere fun?
@WetBankGuy That is just sick.
I used to have about 20 of those soft squeezie balls for fidgety hands. I sold 'em before I moved here. Could really use them now.
@blondie80 That's lol b/c it's pretty much what I'm doing. I feel I have to make sure he isn't coming for me so I "check" on him from the br
@terrilynnh You mean about the roach or the picture? No fucking way I'd let that spider crawl on my face.
@thegilch Now I feel creepy crawly all over my skin. That is horrible.
EEWWWWWWW..... http://tinyurl.com/la2ym
@blondie80 I didn't do either... I am staying out of the living room and praying he'll stay in there till my husband gets home!
I am losing my voice. Students keep asking me if this is from yelling @ them. But it's actually from coughing. This happens every year.
@CalamityJen No biggie! I'm pretty used to roaches, having lived on the gulf coast my whole life, but this one is just a monster. eewww! lol
@CalamityJen Please don't say that. I'm currently avoiding the living room. This sucker is DISGUSTING and HUGE!
The biggest roach in the history of the insect kingdom is in my living room right now.
Dearest Santa, i have been perfect all year...  your good friend, Lucy Van Pelt
@giovannagarcia Thank god animals are so sweet and easy to please. :)
@giovannagarcia That is soooo cute! I luvs teh kittehs. But I think I would still worry if a dog were pissing on my laptop. lol
Man, I wonder if I'll be dead of some worry-related illness before I stop worrying. Today was pretty okay.
Here goes another week!
@wirldwyde Outgrew all of them & replaced the black ones first b/c they're the most versitile.
So tired. I'm outie! good nite, everyone!
@shercole I wonder if they're too "out of the loop" techonolgy-wise, to realize.... maybe they care but don't understand the technology
@shercole I'm thinking you couldn't be more right about that! Where are their mommies?
@shercole I get creeped out touching pens and desks sometimes. So many coughs and sneezes! eewwww
@Gloson Do your parents express worry about online friendships? Many parents in US are worried about twitter & other social network sites.
@shercole Plus, schools are germ factories. Yucky!
@shercole Boots are cool. It's been a while since I've had any ~like 10+ years, yikes~
@TKPope tee hee. she is pretty cute, huh? lol
@TKPope I &lt;3 the kitteh on your profile pic!
@shercole Me TOO! I'm so stuffy & coughy. I get this every year at this time. I hate winter.
@Gloson I wish more American students could study abroad as well.
@Gloson You're probably more advanced than 10 year olds here, too. But any new culture *is* a great learning experience.
@Gloson Sounds like you need more advanced classes. Do they have that available for you?
I hate winter. I hereby diagnose myself w/ Seasonal Affective Disorder. When will this be over?
@Gloson Do you have a computer in your home? Do most of your friends have them too?
@Gloson What is your school like?
@Gloson Do most of your friends know as much about technology and English as you?
@Gloson Where did you learn English? You "speak" very well. Did you learn in school?
@Gloson I have a couple more questions for ya, if it's not harassment....
Are there any twittering great-grandmas or great-grandpas out there?
@Gloson I wonder who is the oldest twitter user.... that might be interesting to know.
@Gloson PLN=personal learning network.
I don't know what a purple effort is.
@Gloson If it's not rude to ask, how old are you? You look quite young in your pictures. Good to see you developing a PLN so young!
@Gloson Once a man asked me in a forward way to share w/ him a bottle of wine. That's the only twitter "harrassment" I've ever experienced.
@Gloson lol. did you ever ask a teacher something like that? I don't know why they care what I wear. maybe thy think i'm a goth chick.
So I guess I'll try to figure out what to wear tomorrow.
Students always ask me why I wear black every day. I don't want 2 tell 'em it's b/c I've outgrown all my clothes & only the black ones fit.
@shercole Fry says we watch TV for the predictability. if anyone understands TV, it's Fry. ~i heart futurama~
I can't stop coughing. I think I'm getting sick.
@s0ni Did you ever start the dancing blog?
@s0ni Oh, that makes sense. This is kinda fun. I like when you share this kinda stuff in progress.
@s0ni What's your thinking on the colors? Maybe, again, cartoony?
@s0ni I agree about the hearts and the cartoony guns. What about a more cartoony spin to the letters?
@s0ni They're powered by various alternative fuels. Still I don't like cars. :)
Tdy I lrnd what "I'll retire to bedlam!" means.It means everyone around me is so fucking crazy I may as well check myself in.I can dig it.
@s0ni I wonder if I wrote them an outraged letter about the selling of kids they would stop that horrible practice? lol
@s0ni Did you see the new one about the cars? I won't play it until they give me greenbucks for signing in like they do the others.
@s0ni So I'll try to catch up w/ you in the next few weeks & we can "fish" each other.
@s0ni It really pisses me off that no matter how many fish you get, you can't "get" any of the cool ones you buy in your own cove.
@s0ni I've been selling all my kids w/ fruit on their heads. I feel kinda bad selling kids, but.... that's just kinda weird anyway.
@OCTechguy Many of these students live in areas that were devastated just 3 yrs ago by Katrina. That's a big part of their short lives.
@OCTechguy ohhhhhhh race. ha!
"daddy is so good he gets $500 an hour to fight w/ ppl, but he fights with me for free cuz i'm his daughter."
"daddy's a litigator. those are the scariest kinds of lawyers.... "
@s0ni I've been forgetting about it, but I got yours today & was re-inspired!
@YatPundit ha ha! She knew what I meant tho, b/c we had talked about it before! But you're right, that sounds funny!
@shercole Yeah, I think I watched that "tardy" speech about 8 times. That, and the one where she said, "we can totally party w/ the Hatians"
@s0ni So, you, like know people who are way famous! That makes me cool by association.
@shercole I thought about you when I watched clueless about 5x this weekend. Just ordered it from amazon & it came Friday. So cute!
@OCTechguy huh? i'm confused....
@s0ni It's, like, way cute. You look like such a Betty! ~been watching clueless this weekend.~
@magic8bot Shut up.
But I know what I know, ya know? I can't teach them anything about dealing w/ being black in america, but I *can* teach English.
I mean, you can hate me or unfollow me or whatever, but I worry with each new lesson that it's "too white" i.e. NOT RELEVANT to these kids.
Am I allowed to discuss issues of race on twitter?
@shercole thx! :) :) :)
I won't leave before the school year is up, and things *are* better than they were, but the anger is draining & exhausting to deal w/.
I don't know how long I'll be able to emotionally handle the constant stream of anger & hatred I feel at this school.
@s0ni Did you use the cartoon you to make your facebook profile pic?
@TheGilch OK. apparently it did send, but w/ a few of the bottom ones with your answers. oh well.
@TheGilch Answered all your FB questions, but it won't send. GRRR.
@injenuity I can't seem to find that flickr acct
M & M's are getting all fancy. Raspberry almond.
@TweetCaroline i stubbed my toe?
I was "learning" tai chi last night from an accomplished friend. He knocked me on my ass by doing nothing at all. Cool.
@KittyCat862 Soooo cute! I like the way they talk. Wall-e and Eve, that is!
Watching WALL-E for the first time.
@Im_X1 Hope your birthday was fun!
@Im_X1 So sorry I didn't make it. My parents are in town, and I didn't think they'd be available, but they wanted to see me.
Hung out in the Quarter w/ my parents today & missed the tweetup!
OMG I  want this episode of Sarah Silverman to use in class. On creating new words and the nature of slang & what language means. :)
@Im_X1 Time? Place? Yay!
@Im_X1 When's the b-day tweetup? Am I still invited?
Daddy is taking us to Coop's tonight, my new favorite place to eat!
Bryan's screensaver: we heard you like to drive, so we put a car in your car so you can drive while you drive.
@YatPundit That "put Mark Twain on my to-eat list" thing sounded weird. But I bet he'd have a sense of humor about it!
@TheGilch I haven't seen that show, but I like that girl that's in it. She was a recurring character on scrubs, on of my favorite shows.
Parents are coming tomorrow. Cleaned the house, pretty much. What is passing for clean lately, anyway.
@lisaheindel Exactly. It's fun again, mostly. :)
Just posted: Notes From a Much Better Week http://tinyurl.com/5ju63o
@terrifik I appreciate your advice last night about the cable. I'll let you know how it goes.
@giovannagarcia @WillyB It was rocky for a while, but it's so much better. I have hope it will improve even more. Thx for the well wishes!
Why is obama still asking for money? I'm confused about that.
This week has been sooooo much much better than the last week of school. Major relief. I'm pretty happy about how it's going.
All the Scrubs with Jordan in them are my favorites.
@injenuity Thanks! I will make them switch the crap modem. Thanks a million.
@injenuity How do you know?
It will go out again, though.
The internet is currently working with the tv at the same time. Cox dude said it couldn't happen. These people are stupid.
@terrifik No, I don't have digital cable. Just regular cable & high speed internet. 2 tvs & 1 modem. :(
@schleifnet I have ordered a higher-quality splitter from amazon. I hope this works!
@lisaheindel Well, I wish I knew how to bring the magic back! lol
What I want to know is, if a 3 way splitter can't work, then WHY did it work for a couple of months?
RT @juliaroy is giving away a $500 #Kmart Gift Card on her blog - simply tweet or comment to enter http://urlbrief.com/a3a746
I mean, it took them a MONTH to give us internet in the first place. That would be plenty of time, I would think, to get it RIGHT
Then why in the FUcK did THEY set it up that way?
Cox came to "fix" our internet today.Left saying that they couldn't. We can't have a 3 way splitter b/c cable & internet won't both work.
@injenuity Thanks. Will have to find some latex-free socks. Also read about some ppl w/ allergies to dyes in fabrics.
@wirldwyde lolz!
@giobigez I was just wondering about that, too. He only wears long socks in winter b/c of this, so it only comes up when it's cold.
@linnetwoods Of course not butting in! I'm figuring that out, too. Socks are so close & tight.
@wirldwyde I would run!
@injenuity I will look into the latex thing. Because he wears cotton all the time on other parts of his body.
@KellyShibari I don't know. Wouldn't he be allergic all over his body?
My husband's legs get a rash any time he wears long socks. Anyone know of special socks that are hypo-allergenic, or something?
Look at this freaky-ass bug: http://tinyurl.com/6nllgf
@WetBankGuy I just eliminated 1.They're not really different & I don't think the other tchr should have included both. So I went w/ conflict
Samuel L. Jackson's part in Jurassic Park seems small for him.
@dmcordell That's such a sad story.
OK, I thought the Grinch that was on was the cartoon. bummer. It's the Jim Carrey one.
@Aunk I don't get it.
@Pontchartrain If I hadn't seen it myself I wouldn't have believed it.
@BlondeByDesign I'm sorry about the kitty. I really hope you find her (him? i forgot).
The Grinch is on at 7. Yay!
Had wanted to go watch Auntie Mame at Lafitte in Exile, but am waaayyy too tired. Barely slept last night.
@BlondeByDesign So you've herded cattle! wow. You are awesome.
@s0ni Telling us there is a funny joke isn't as funny as telling the joke, though! lol
@AblativMeatshld Not to be contentious, but hurricanes haven't changed either. I know they're not the same. *rolls eyes back, just for fun*
@djpoptart Obviously I felt it jumped the shark earlier than that b/c I never saw that one! lol.
@BlondeByDesign Please tell me you found kitty.
Today was SUCH a better day. I'm most relieved. And tired. And watching Seinfeld. Ahhhhhh.
I miss watching Weeds. But the last season I saw wasn't that great. Each season has gotten less interesting.
@AblativMeatshld  I was thinking of how some are re-structuring hurricane classifications. Wind speed isn't the only measure of a hurricane
@BlondeByDesign I'm sorry about your dad. :(  Is Montana your home state?
@AblativMeatshld I know, you're right. But I still wonder whether it's time to re-visit that as a definition. But I'm no expert.
@AblativMeatshld I just heard someone on radio say this recession is a year old. Weird b/c they didn't know if we were in one only a mo. ago
@overflowinbrain Do you have any inbound links from there?
@Gloson That's an excellent attitude to have!
But twitter is not conducive to eye-closing. So, once again, good night all! esp @loudmouthman!
I have found that even if I don't SLEEP my eyes look & feel better if I at least CLOSE THEM as much as possible. Maybe listen to something?
But alas, today is tomorrow. So I'm going to try to sleep now! Good night @blondebydesign @gloson @loudmouthman @TKpope. later, friends.
I seriously don't know why I can't sleep. I ALWAYS sleep. I'm nervous about tomorrow. For tomorrow to go well, I need my sleep!
@Gloson So you're already halfway through Monday! Lucky you!
@Gloson not everyone, just everyone here in this sliver of the globe. I need to go to bed soon!
@BlondeByDesign hi! where are you. seems you're traveling a lot.
@Gloson So interesting and cool that I can talk to someone who has just finished lunch. It's 1:40 in the morning here. :)
The only thing worse than Windows Vista is Office 2007.
@viqifrench "A dilemma a character faces. Not necessarily the same as a conflict. Often a moral question."
@viqifrench the notes i am looking at say "problem" is different from "conflict"
@WetBankGuy exactly.or "internal conflict"- these are the notes the tchr b4 me gave to students.made prob & conf 2 things, sd thy were diff.
@viqifrench I've usually heard this called "conflict" -- is this different?
Anyone evr heard "problem" used as a literary term?"A dilemma a character faces. Not necessarily same as a conflict.often a moral question."
It's really a big fat poop that my co-teacher hasn't responded to emails (and 1 phone call).
I wonder what would happen if we had to call 911 from this French Quarter apartment? How would they get in the front gate?
I am so tired of my internet screwing up. It goes "out" at least once a day. Cox sucks. But I really am out. Good night, tweeties!
@seedoflife I think he kinda looks like JFK on that image.
I'm going to bed. I'm lame, going to bed @ 930 on a Saturday night. So much for the NOLA glamor. I'm still the same geek.
@wirldwyde OK, so you're talking real science & I'm talking about cartoons. Typical of me! lol
@SarahInMI Now the prob is breaking away from it.We get ornaments as gifts,and I don't want to use 'em until there r enough "different" ones
@SarahInMI I have a color-coordinated Christmas tree just because the first year I had one, I didn't have anything, so it was easy.
@SarahInMI That was an amazingly short hissy fit. I usually don't get over hissies that quickly. :)
@Akula I guess you weren't the first customer not to know about the promotion/coupon. Pretty good.
@kissmygumbo Nothing can stop this snoring. Nothing. He's a super sweet husband when he's awake, though. So it's okay.
@tgardner We need a button that allows for @replies and RTweets w/o taking up our tweet space. Some ppl have long usernames.
@dmcordell All of life, I'd guess, with parenting & teaching topping the list!
@Akula Not typical for people to take that extra time. score!
Bryan is snoring. Not quietly, either.
@wirldwyde Is that Farnsworth too? I don't remember that one.
@tgardner + at least two for a re-tweet!
Farnsworth says, "Quantum physics means anything can happen at any time for no reason."
Emailing my city council member. I feel so civic-minded.
I'm afraid to ask them, though. I don't want to stir up bad memories.
I don't know if I have an appreciation for what these 9th ward kids went through just three years ago. Probably not.
What is with this twitter dumping thing? Is this an actual relationship dumping, or an unfollowing thing?
@KittyCat862 Yeah, that was the help I got under my google search for "How to teach inner city kids" can u tell I'm desperate?
Pop culture connections to "The Gift of the Magi"?
Lafitte in Exile is playing Auntie Mame on Monday night at 8. The one with Rosalynd Russel. Yay.
@TheGilch Good rules. :)
Yeah. It's my mood.
Maybe it's my mood, but I'm expecting Gothic cold temperatures this winter in NOLA, a la To Kill a Mockingbird. Weird portent of doom.
@injenuity I hope you're right. That's simply ridiculous.
Not to mention that story perpetuates this whole "teacher as martyr for student achievement" thing that I cannot stand. Any cost? whatever.
@TheGilch How do you do it? I have to know b/c I'm not sure I can go in on Mnday.
@injenuity elaborate. I'd love to hear.
@dmcordell Exactly. Destruction of property is a criminal act, not a reward for something...
I find this a completely unacceptable way of motivating students: http://www.lessonplanspage.com/inspiration/IUnusualMotivation.htm
One of the ones missing is my COLD WAR FILMS binder. Agh.
@followthatdog Thanks. :(
@jareyn maybe 6-8. I knocked on doors but nobody was home today.
I left a box with a couple of teaching binders in the common area of the condo so I could get it to my car, and now it's gone. tearing up.
Hard for me to relax or have any fun as long as I don't feel I have a handle on school monday. But can't get a handle, either. Lord.
@s0ni Isn't there a way to back-order, or get on a list or something?
@WetBankGuy of course. :-)
@sadcox Yes. That's it.
How did Nagin even get re-elected?
@s0ni I thought you looked great! that was pretty fun, huh?
@WetBankGuy I just thought that statement was pretty damn funny. And I thought the sarcasm would come across w/o lol's b/c I was out of room
@YatPundit The whole thing is really pathetic. And frustrating.
@sadcox Is the Zen a microsoft product?
@WetBankGuy confused.
@YatPundit Sad. Yes. And I really don't care if RDS is "better" it's still completely unacceptable.
New schools being added to the RSD because of low performance. Funny how they think the RSD does a better job.
The School Facilities Master Plan for OP is a vital component of the robust creative change process currently underway in the city of New O.
@s0ni I just saw you on the dirty coast website modelin' the DJ Soul Sister t-shirt. Acting all sexy! lol

Does *everyone* in NOLA identify with a particular high school, or just graduates of the "right" ones?
Husband not getting off till ten. That's a long time.
@blondie80 I puffed a while, then put it out temporarily. a fireman sold it to me. a futurama-fan fireman. Will try again later.
Also, bought some really primo catnip for kitteh. He's happy.
As a cigarette smoker, not sure I know how to smoke a cigar.
I bought a cigar. Gonna smoke it now, on the balcony. Am reminded of @NOLAnotes.
What a fun couple of hours in the french quarter. deep conversations, cigars, liquor and food. no groceries, though.
there's a sign on the door saying if u have a gambling problem call a number. this is b/c drinking is not a problem. :-)
lafitte's in exile is showin auntie mame w/ rosalynd russel on monday. i officially love this place.
was headed to the rouse's again. had a drink @ lafitte's. now having another (and more fun) at lafitte's in exile.
the more comfortable i get living here, the more often i try to go get groceries and end up in a bar.
Tentative beginnings of a new blog: http://alvastar.com Need a blogroll. Need to fix a couple of headers. Need to remove stupid links.
Wow. This is depressing.
Dear NOLA twitterers: What are your thoughts on this hospital thing in Mid-City. Am reading blogs @ it now.
@bygbaby As long as you don't follow them, why does it matter if they follow you? Just wondering.
I hear the po po.
@schleifnet That is precious. Looks like a lot of work. But so cute!
@stacey0821 Where are you? Are you getting wet?
@schleifnet lol! I invented the ball point pen, the flush toilet & the iPod.
Anyone know where I can see "Left Behind: The Story on NOLA public schools" Online?
@schleifnet you mean you made the whole site newsvine?
@etherjammer Exactly. I agree.
@etherjammer I don't follow people who don't follow others. That'll show em.
@schleifnet was that a page you made? link?
I wish there was a "digg" type site just for new orleans.
@schleifnet dm me
@schleifnet Great to know, thanks a lot.
@robschafer Thanks!
@sadcox Sure! of course.
@sadcox That is a great price!
But NOPD still shouldn't lie to the public about stats.
@nsingman And yes, I'm talking about stats. I think it's entirely possible to be safe here if you're aware & sober & not out walking @ 3 am
@nsingman I feel pretty safe too, but there were four armed robberies within 3 blocks of my house on the 23rd. Just saying they lie.
If ppl use the NOPD crime maps to decide whether to come here, or to move here, and something happens to them, isn't the NOPD responsible?
OK, so. NOPD just straight out lies about crime in the French Quarter. Just lies. No shame, huh? That is crazy.
Looking at New Orleans citizen crime watch and thinking I need a gun.
Going to sleep in my new PJ's. Thanks for the MP3 advice, and goooood night.
Getting new clothes is always fun, but there's something about new PJ's.... a girl really can never have enough...
I don't like those commercials where the broom & mop serenade the housewives, but I did just see a good one. ugh.
@hbusby Don't want to make that mistake again, so I'm leaning toward the 16 gig nano.
@kboutelle What are PMP's?
@hbusby I did love my little iPod shuffle before it went kaput. But i'd only had it a week before I realized I should've bought the big one
Alternatively, a couple of 1 gig players would work, so one could be for walking & one for chillin & podcasts, but why?
1-2 gig is not enough. 8 probably is, but it's only 40 bucks more for 16. hmmmm
@hbusby Just making sure I'm not just going for what's cute. They are soooo cute.
An 8 gig samsung is as much as a 16 gig ipod.
@sadcox does that zen stone have an lcd display or a way to make playlists? that's what annoyed me @ my shuffle. no playlists
I got Sansa clip, Archos, Creative Zen Stone and Samsung. Any comments? Will I like them as much as I liked my iPod?
Anyone use an MP3 player that's not an iPod that they'd recommend?
Ice Cube will be @ House of Blues on December 10. Not really Christmas fare, but still.
Am I the only one with that song from the Dell commercial stuck in my head? "I am green today.... I chirp for joy like a cricket song..."
@HeatherShorter Can't complain. Already ate, so it's kinda "over" now.
@HeatherShorter He looks like his mama! :)
Happy Thanksgiving, everyone!
@caderoux Thanks for taking that picture! And the link. I like hearing about the Ursulines.
@YatPundit reading about Artemis.
I think all this car loving is a sickness. Mention to people that they might not need 1/person, and they lose their minds. Eyes roll back.
Just re-watching that video. Woah.
I guess it's some kind of madonna-whore thing.
@YatPundit Why, of course. Still, no comment on where that archetype comes from? Similar female figures?
@caderoux That's not where the convent is now. ~chartres & ursulines~ hmmmm.
@caderoux I was just about to ask you where that was! tee hee! thanks.
Plus a few other things, but those can be counted on.
Because if anything sparks @YatPundit to talk it's catholic or sex related!
The Catholic school girl thing must tap into some other, more universal symbol. Or I think too mch, or I just want @YatPundit's attention.
@shercole or a PR stunt? i'm just saying...
@shercole is that Catholic school girl look in both a coincidence? a fad? something she sparked?
Or am I too polite to ask?
In salacious literature, how old is the catholic school girl stereotype? Are there prior versions of it?
@shercole Why does that movie remind me of Aerosmith?
@shercole Those outfits w/ the short, school girl skirts?
@shercole probably b/c clueless is classic.
@shercole or ten things i hate about you. i had them on VHS. then i sold 'em this summer. &lt;sigh&gt;
@shercole I was trying to remember that McDonald's line!!! I bought Wall-e @ blockbuster tdy, but wld rather have found clueless.
@shercole I remember Mel Gibson correctly, and he didn't say that.
@damian613 Why Ang Lee?
There must be more tolerance of typos when we all type @ odd hours of the day for various purposes, no?
@shercole u had me laughing till I coughed! ~or to put it another way: lol~
@damian613 Um.... interpret the time-wise, genre-wise thing how you will. Who "goes" with him, in terms of influence/era/tree-of-humanity
@shercole thanks! I totally spaced. ~to quote my favorite teen-movie heroin. Clueless was on last weekend~
If you had to sort Quentin Tarantino into a film-maker generation chart, who would be his compatriots?
Dancing to Madonna in my apartment. Thanks to YouTube and Jeremy from the Clover Grill. and the lovely weather. Most thankful.
@YatPundit someday you'll miss it. for now, there are ear plugs.
@shercole I don't know if you're around today.how are ya? what's the name of that music site i signed up 4? listening to morris day?
@YatPundit You know, imitation is the highest form of flattery and all that!
@YatPundit That's the highest tribute!
@YatPundit Well, jeremy played Madonna @ my request & danced a little. so fun!
@YatPundit I *do* know that nobody ever played Madonna for me at the Nellie Deli.
@YatPundit QM=Quarter Master (translation=the Nellie Deli) And I don't know anything about Show Time @Clover. do tell.
Conclusion: Clover Grill cburger isn't better than QM, but held up better to travel time. And nobody ever played Madonna 4 me @ QM.
@newmtv of course. i haven't even finished the last turkey & diet from j. whites!
@newmtv I can't imagine why you are fucking with my brain at a time like this. lol
Left the house to go to Rouses. Did that. Then went to J. Whites. Got drunk. Was hungry. Went to clover grill. Futurama takes a back seat.
Obama is smart to take experienced ppl onto his team, even if it seems "not a change." Change comes from BHO. Experience from the others.
And the steamboat is playing something. and the sun is going down over the city. I'm thankful.
My first meal from the Clover Grill. The guy there was so sweet to me. Now I'm home w/ my burger.He says it's better than the Qtr Master.
Stopping the movie to walk to Rouse's before it gets dark ~that's the A&P for the natives ;)~ I hate daylight savings time.
@c3ane They usually put these on TV a little while after they come out on DVD. DVD came out Nov 4, so I'm looking for it soon.

@YatPundit Bummer. A chocolate fountain is cool.
Where do you buy your Christmas tree? It's important to get a beautiful one.
@YatPundit Ok, where do I get a ham bone? Do they sell those? Or do I have to cook a ham?
@YatPundit Any sausage recommendations for that red beans & rice recipe you gave?
Pretty much everyone's saying fo-berg, foe-berg, accent on first syllable. Except @NOLAnotes says fah-berg.

@YatPundit Awesome! Thanks.

My blog is actually doing worse now that I'm posting again.

Anyone else have an allergy to rinds, shells, etc. Like the skin part of peanuts, or the outer, dark green part of avocados?
@jareyn @jareyn Oh, I see. Of course.
Why is black friday called BLACK? It's not a bad day, right? I personally refuse to wake up at 4 am to buy stuff. But seems Green Friday?
@lizmoney I hope they just call him Kal, or something.
Less than 1/2 a mile from them, and it doesn't matter at all. Except it's interesting how close together rich & poor are here.
I didn't realize just exactly how close to Brad & angelina I actually live. .4 miles.
So cage DOES own Anne Rice's old house, according to casasugar, and is also selling that one: http://casasugar.com/2463204
IMDB confirms the Kal-El thing. Cage was named after a comic book character, it says, so he named his son after one also.
@jareyn I was just thinking that! But I figured ppl were tired of hearing about Cage. Good Lord. That's ridiculous.
@WorldHarmony That does sound hilarious. I'll have to watch that!
Anne Rice owned the LaLaurie house?
Is any of this true? http://tinyurl.com/67trnv
One blog says he's not leaving the FQ, although they called the FQ, the "Garden Quarter," so I don't know if they know anything.
@shercole Mine too. I'm so glad. I needed time to prepare & re-group.
@NOLAnotes I wonder why he's selling. Isn't this a bad time to sell property? Also, since he & fam live nxt door, possible thy're not lvg NO
And the "dots of light" in St. Tammany the article refers to at the end are more likely KKK meetings than LaLaurie Satanic rituals.
This article is the first I've read of a friendship b/c Mme. LaLaurie & Marie Laveau. http://www.nola.com/lalaurie/trail/trail.html
@shercole Tomorrow is your only day off? Or it's the start of your vacay?
Anyone know if the New Orleans Bee was a reputable paper?
@shercole Exactly the same. Family Guy. And reading about the LaLaurie Mansion for no particular reason. I'm so boring.
Stewie is giving speaking lessons a la "My Fair Lady": The life of the wife is ended by the knife.
@Gloson You're right about that! Especially the vitamins, fruits & veggies. I sleep plenty, lately.

FQ business owners told me they do better $$ when the Saints lose b/c locals don't spend money & tourists spend more when their team wins.

@WorldHarmony You can only do the online thing for renewals. First time, you gotta go there in person. :-(  Reaper? never saw that.
@kusdiva Ya know, I don't know how long he's owned it, but just read that he doesn't live in it. next door. I don't know if I cld live there
@Im_X1 I think it'd be way cool if a museum or something owned it so ppl could see the inside!

Holy crap. It's already midnight.
Just came back from visiting friends, old, old ones, in Denham Springs. Pretty nice. Weird to see ppl again after so long.
@kirbstr Exactly. Hateful. ;)
It's funny how students think we give homework because we're unhappy.

CLUELESS is on!!!!
@edventures What kind of job did you apply for?
@TheGilch Why not, I plan to!
@damian613 Especially medieval Europe.
@damian613 And seeing as the story takes place in France anyway, I don't know why they bothered w/ a pitiful English accent at all.
@damian613 Also, I thought Drew Barrymore's accent in Ever After was so bad as to *almost* ruin it. but I still like it.
@damian613 Absolutely. It's wonderful. Hilarious. Classic. I think I'll turn off this trash & pop in that DVD, now that you mention it.
@damian613 lol. not your bag, huh?
I do love the princess movies. Princess Bride, Princess Diaries, Prince & Me, Ever After. I'm a silly sap.
@TheGilch She's a crass, trashy ho. I don't like her at all. Completely ungraceful. yuk
@damian613 Don't bother w/ the second one. It already sucks. The first was so sweet.
It really really sucks that The Prince and Me II has a different Paige Morgan. Like we wouldn't notice. I want Julia Stiles!
Never did find the remote. Bummer.

@lindseak Please! That sounds interesting.
@dmcordell That's incredible. Once in a lifetime! ~and we never had cops at our school when i went to h.s. either~
@queenoftheclick Low tolerance is cheaper!
@dmcordell I guess as long as the vegetarian isn't offended by cooking meat, or the carnivore does all the cooking!
@dmcordell The cop was dealing with this student when I left. There are cops on every floor of the school.
@kirbstr As Toula's dad says in "My Big Fat Greek Wedding": There are 2 kinds of ppl in this world, Greeks & those who wish they were Greek.
I always wished I were Greek.
@lindseak What is a grape cake?
@TheGilch BTW, did I ever tell you that you remind me of my good friend Leslie?
@TheGilch True about expulsion. It's really hard to know what's right. Alternative school is practically prison.
@TheGilch I'm down with the community service idea, but locations of battered women's shelters are not usually common knowledge for safety.
@TheGilch I'm inclined to agree. I don't think kids really care about suspension. It's a vacation from school.
Can a vegetarian and a meat-eater be happily married? How do they prepare meals together?
@TheGilch Well, we like what we like. I'm not sure it's "greatness" so  much as infamy. lol
Speaking of arrests, a kid pushed a teacher Friday right as school ended. Not expelled. Just suspended. What do you think?
@TheGilch I always wonder, though, how people don't KNOW about the cameras already. I guess they don't watch Cops.
@TheGilch God, I hate that show so much. If I wanted to see people getting arrested I'd go outside. Or better yet, go to work.
@raavi He's got a point. I ask myself about that all the time in re: the public schools.
@Astrogirl426 Very difficult, apparently. And don't get me started on the apostrophe. Good lord.
@Astrogirl426 I love that you love that. Most people think it's anal and uptight to mention or even notice! lol
It bugs me that tbs has "More movie... less commercials" on the screen. It's "Fewer"!!! not less.
@GentillyGirl Tribal isn't a good or bad thing.Just never lived anywhere where neighborhoods mattered so much.Even High Schools matter here.
Wikipedia article makes me think my students could be talking about the upper 9th ward when they say "across the canal"
@bleckley Thanks! I appreciate your help.
@liprap I don't think these kids are from metairie, though. I thought from the context that "across the canal" was one of the "wards"
New Orleans is more tribal than any other place I've lived. Everyone is into their neighborhoods. I don't know one from the other.
@liprap Now I don't know. I thought they were saying "Across the canal" ??
@cburell probably so. sorry so confused.
@GentillyGirl when were you in san fran?
To NOLA tweeters: What are distinctions or identifying traits b/w 9th & 7th wards? And what is "across the canal"? I thought that was 9th?
@GentillyGirl Also, was it ever officially called that, or was it always a nickname?
@GentillyGirl Maybe I'll start writing it, now that I know how to spell it! tee hee
@cburell Seems I remember you have done international pen/email pals or some such before? Advice on starting that?
@GentillyGirl Plus, the English teacher in me is bothered by the varied spellings of "Nelly" ~nellie?~ on the QM's own signs. that's me.
@GentillyGirl I know, right? I never say that b/c it seems like I'm POSING as a native when I'm not. huh. like calling the Rouse's the A&P
@derekeb If I had a sewing machine, I'd make old t-shirts w/ cool logos into little pillows.
@bleckley 8th grade and 9th. but most are not on level.
Just had a burger delivered from the Quarter Master. Yum.
@Pistachio Cooking is soul-crushing to me. So feel free to send food my way! lol
@bleckley Do you think there are enough students for each to have their own pen pal, by mail or otherwise? I have 150.
@bleckley electronic pen pals? awesome!
Maybe there are ways to get pen pals or student buddies from other countries? Using the web? @cburrell? He probably knows!
@dmcordell Voice thread is so cool. We're supposed to get new computers soon. I hope that really happens.
@dmcordell Exactly. I have several of those in my unit. As well as poems, songs, video clips.
@WorldHarmony I really would like to take them somewhere. Somewhere outside the US. Just to show other ways & ppl.
@WorldHarmony Or am I thinking of this the wrong way? Interested in your sociological opinion... teach me.
@WorldHarmony & it seems to me tht anyone from the New Orleans Metro area is frm "around here" if thy have a sense of how big the world is.
@WorldHarmony Yes. But I also asked if anyone had visited anywhere. No. Except for the few who evacuated to Houston for Katrina.
Like New Orleans is the WHOLE WORLD. They need to see other places, cultures, people, things. They need experiences.
No, I'm from the 9th ward. Or, no, I'm from the 7th ward. Or no I'm from "across the canal" or, in one case, "No, I'm from by the Wallgreens
An initial observation about this pop. of students: they're very insular. I ask them if they're from "around here." Answer? ...
@viqifrench Thanks for that LA Times article. It gave me some ideas about a totally different situation!
@dmcordell Although, I'd rather teach my autobiography unit, which allows for self-exploration and for me to get to know them.
@dmcordell Good, good. I'll find ways to get input. I'm supposed to be teaching short stories.  wld like to find better ones than r in txt.
OK, 8 days till I go back. How do I prepare? Need inspiration, a new attitude, management strategies & kick-ass lesson plans.
After a 2 hour documentary, some reading on the web and more than 30 mins. of this tape, I still don't know WHY they did it.
He says they shouldn't "rot in some old nursing home." Yeah, dying of old age is a bitch. What a psycho.
@YatPundit This tape is ultimate weirdness. And, it sheds no light on the situation, really. Does drive home the reality of it though.
A morbid thing to do, I guess. It's just a habit of mine to try in vain to make sense of the senseless.
Listening to the Jonestown death tape after watching a documentary about it this afternoon: http://jonestown.sdsu.edu/
Every time I click over to my DMs there are different ones missing.
@TKPope I've done it that way in the middle or later parts of the year, after I know everyone.
@wirldwyde Oh well, I've been uncool before.
@SistersTalk Our Verizon bill was OUTRAGEOUS last time. They said we went over our minutes, but I HATE talking on phone. don't believe it.
@charlotteAsh That's really sad. So many arrested for murder going free.
@fancyfembot I was thinking you were!
@dmcordell Exactly. They haven't used their freedom well so far, and need to earn it back.
@dmcordell You've been at the same school that long?
@fancyfembot I think they'll choose the assigned seats. Yikes.
Anyone else have DM's disappearing?
@joyntheir RT = retweet ~something someone else tweeted u want to share~ DM= Direct Message
But I have ALWAYS assigned seats. ALWAYS. I couldn't believe the teacher in there hadn't already done it. Esp. given their behavior.
It was the morning of my third day before I was even given a roster, and it's still not correct. 1/2 of my 5th period is missing.
I don't see any way to learn this many students' names without assigned seats. Plus, they are misbehaving badly. But they won't like it.
High School teachers: Do you assign seats?
@lbilak Thanks. I need to hear that now.
@Im_X1 Now I have a week off to re-group.
Here's what happened today: http://tinyurl.com/6pgo4g
@dmcordell This particular class is supposed to be mine alone. It's the only one. But they haven't had a teacher for 6 weeks....
@WorldHarmony There are 4 or 5 cops at all times. Two on my floor. NOLA public schools.
@Im_X1 It should not be allowed at all. That was ridiculous. I just blogged more details.
@damian613 It was too much to explain, so I blogged it.
@skydaddy Not kidding. I wish.
@Im_X1 She apparently gives all the teachers a hard time. I was just stunned. Can't believe thy didn't tell her to schedule a conference.
@digitalmaverick Not yet. By the end of this day, I just wanted to go home.
@lbilak It's a madhouse. Many of the kids have been extremely rude to me. I haven't even taught yet! Keep syng thy want other tchr back.
First period a parent called me into the hallway & chewed me out right there, in front of an administrator & cop, both of whom did nothing.
Co-teacher told me he overheard today the kids saying they were going to try to make me quit.
Man, that was a great dinner. I'm way sleepy now. Tomorrow is friday. Then, a working break to get things really together.
@lbilak How's things? Finished my third day today.
finally eating at coop's. smoked duck quesadillas to start
@mamikaze Oh. lol.
@blondie80 They do need help. Was just watching this: http://tinyurl.com/5k2ort
@mamikaze I think you put the wrong link?
@blondie80 Oh, there have been about 10 this year. It's really unbelievable.
What is this about? Woah. http://tinyurl.com/6joooa
@liprap Sorry about the blog. I don't know what to do about it. Have called godaddy, and they are no help.
About today: http://tinyurl.com/6k8o5c
Today was un freaking believable. Just stunning.
@ablativemeatshield yes. 3rd fire this week. 2nd one today. police arrested fire setter. all students waiting outside.
second fire today. waiting outside while thy put out fire & arrest arsonist.
Checking back in briefly to say that I just cannot respect anyone that calls a shrimp a "prawn."
I'm going to bed early b/c I'm going in suuuuper early in the morning to try to get some stuff unpacked from my car. Good day. Good night!
@damian613 I've had problems with some particular programs not being compatible w/ vista. No good words for Vista from me.
I got my automatic transmission back. Sold the other car instead. Long story short, city driving w/ a stick sucks & my husband loves me.
@dmcordell B/c the teacher I work with has been doing double duty for about 6 weeks. That, and the face-clawing meeting! lol
@dmcordell It was good. Spent most of the day doing catch-up grading for a district-mandated test that was due today.
@damian613 Vista causes problems with everything, in my experience. Including installing programs.
@sadcox Why am I singing "the wheels on the bus" in my head?
@sadcox I'm glad to be posting too. This school has different problems, but the environment is MUCH better, even w/ fires. ~yes, fires!~
@zemote Thanks! Good to be here!
@WetBankGuy Thank you for thanking me.
Just blogged: I'm Back. http://tinyurl.com/6hwrm3
Leaving for first day. ~dreamed last night the students all walked out~ Wish me luck!
Going to bed early, to get a fresh start on a "new" school year tomorrow. Hope this book doesn't give me nightmares!
@damian613 I'm only about 1/2 way through. I think it's supposed to get far worse than this. Woah.
@damian613 I'm reading it now. I haven't seen the movie at all. This guy is.... wow. weapons grade crazy!
This guy in "American Psycho" really really *is* a psycho.
@whynot88 English I and Reading 180, which is a remedial reading program.
@twitterverse Thanks for the congrats!
Reading. American Psycho.
Got my clearance to work form all signed. Start tomorrow for real & for sure. 4 day week, then Thanksgiving break.
Finally done with frustrating stream of forms. So much to do tomorrow. Going to bed. Nite!
@jareyn Saying that I understand that since I'm not going to be paying into it, benefits due from what I have paid so far are reduced.
@SistersTalk He'll have a lot more of it before he's through!
I also have to sign away social security? No wonder nobody wants to work here.
@mamikaze Yes. It's a really long time. It's just mean.
@GentillyGirl Nope. Thanks anyway.
I'd be better off not teaching for 2 more months & getting insurance later than paying $400/mo for a year for meds.
@GentillyGirl They don't have it.
i may not get insurance at all then
@mamikaze it's for a year after coverage starts for anything treated w/in 6 months.
Insurance was a MAJOR reason for teaching at all. I'm going to cry. WTF am I supposed to do?
@mamikaze That is so fucking unfair.
So prescriptions that I was taking before I lost my insurance aren't covered? Fuck them. Just fuck them. Why the fuck wld I get ins. at all?
@BlondeByDesign Yes, one grand collection of assholes.
@GentillyGirl I didn't say it was BETTER food. Just good food.
Do prescription drugs count under the preexisting conditions thing? insurance companies are such assholes.
Baton Rouge has good food. There. I said it.
Hey! I know this principal!
Watching Matilda on TBS. Cute.
Cold today. Yuk.
@cburell You're probably the only person on the planet who understands.
Crying.'m teaching again.I wish there was a way for real education to win. I think it's time I strung my bow & ceased my senseless running.
I hate to say this. I'm serious: The cause of public education in America is dead.
Apache rules!
History is written by the winners.
@blondie80 It's good that you know for sure. My grandmother was adopted so the whole thing's pretty vague...
@NOLAnotes My grandmother was adopted. Family lore says my g-gmother was Apache. How to check that once-&-for-all?
He sure is sweet to cook dinner Y make something different for me. I &lt;3 that Cherokee peacemaker.
@mamikaze I appreciate the war-like tendencies of the Apache. That's just me ~belligerent as I am~
Still, he cooked my food first. :-)
Bryan says "Honey I got ten dollars that says no one wants to hear your mouth."
Vague genealogical information places me 1/16 Apache, and him 1-something Cherokee.
We've gotten into a minor debate about which N.American tribe rules most: Apache or Cherokee.
@mariebeausoleil Works for me too, today. Tomorrow.... oh well.
Does putting laundry away in the closet count as "doing" the laundry?
We had a cup that said Razoo's on it ~along w/ other bars~ and I didn't realize it. Just threw that away. Lynching days are over.
@loudmouthman It says, "Tracking Unknown"
@loudmouthman Thanks so much!
@loudmouthman Is it going to take 24 hours for that little tracking unknown triangle to go away in GA? b/c code is now in before &lt;/bo ...
Now am going crazy trying to insert Google Analytics code before the &lt;/body&gt; when there is NO &lt;/body&gt;!!!
Did it! Changed nickname in profile, then selected "alva" under, "display name publicly as"
@tixrus Does that mean I'd have to change it every time if I'm the only person writing on the blog?
How do I change it so my posts aren't by "admin" in my feed?
I'm going to bed ridiculously early. Gotta clean the house, wash clothes, & work on blog tomorrow. Good night all!
@jlvblogger tee hee. i doubt the economy will last that long! obama has his work cut out!
@OCTechguy I'm not a pro. But I see it as an $80/yr hobby.
@jlvblogger I know! And where will we go from there? The snowball seems to be running down the hill awfully fast!
It's completely weird for Huey Freeman ~regina king~ to be talking about Always maxi pads. Happy period my ass.
@OCTechguy See, I don't know if you can do it or not when you don't host your own blog. Check the cutline website @ that.
@jlvblogger It's coming along with eyeliner for men. After that, I guess grunge is back. &lt;sigh&gt; never throw anything away.
@OCTechguy Neoclassical theme has that file, as does cutline. others, too, i'm sure.
@dmcordell ;-) I will still update TTT w/ teaching stuff... u know, now that I'm teaching again.
@jlvblogger I laughed when the kids started turning their polo collars up. Now I'm waiting for the Motley Crue hair do's.
@dmcordell Thx. I have writing stored up, but am doing some more boring stuff & hope to start real posts soon! Ur support is invaluable.
@jlvblogger I couldn't agree more. Not only do ppl dress like the 80s but the WORST of the 80s. Sequined stretch belts? Good grief!
@OCTechguy I think you can only do that if you host your own blog. I use wordpress on hosting from godaddy.
And the theme says "there's nothing here." Just days of sweat & blood to get it there!
@SethNieman JAVA!! oh my!
@jlvblogger Well, that's good. I guess. It still annoys me.
Also ridiculously excited that I took all those pictures. I'm so silly!
@jlvblogger But does it load slowly for you, or is it just me?
@OCTechguy No. It only changes on refresh. But the refresh is much slower than my other blog. Thy said I cld host &gt;1 blog on same acct...
I'm ridiculously excited about TEN rotating random header images on my new blog! ~w/ no content yet~ http://alvastarr.com
@OCTechguy Is it slow for you? I'm mad that it's so slow!
@OCTechguy It's a php file that the theme creator made to do that! cool huh?
@socialgumbo Are you sure you're following me? I can't seem to find you on DM...
Don't know why the site is so damn slow! But the headers work!
OMG it works! I worked on this for the better part of the day. Don't laugh: http://alvastarr.com
Dear rotating header images: please, please work.
@HumidCity I will see that they do before I write anything more.
@KittyCat862 They are paying way too much in rent to make it. :-(
Hummus is here already! Yay! Tweet ya later!
@Im_X1 I think of you whenever I pass there, and will check them out eventually!!
@KittyCat862 It's not SAINT KURT THE VONNEGUT's DAY already? SHIT. I am so out of it.
@Im_X1 Coop's doesn't deliver? right?
@lisaheindel I LOVE angeli. Whenever I get hooked on something I stick w/ it way too long. But it's ok b/c they rock!
@KittyCat862 Remember the AWESOME sushi place I told you about?? They're going out of business :-(
@Im_X1 Oh, yes. Angeli!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
@KittyCat862 Actually, my mother is praising the wonderful woman I've become. Her guilt is genuine. Sad.
I'm about 60 seconds from doing something radical & ordering hummus from Angeli.

@HumidCity But they used the first one, too. So they were obviously happy enough with it.
@HumidCity But now, it's time to pay me.
@HumidCity I wasn't that happy w/ the first one, so I did the 2nd one b/c I wanted them 2 know I was serious & could do it.
@lisaheindel @NOLAnotes I really should learn not to be such a wuss. ugh.
@NOLAnotes I won't. I'm teaching starting next week, so they'll have to pay for my time now.Absinthe story=my roundabout way to bring it up.
@lisaheindel Good one!
Making blog header images is a pain in the butt.
@NOLAnotes BUT, they haven't paid me for the last 2 stories. I hate asking for $$, even when I worked for it.
@lisaheindel Exactly. We will be fine. It's probably good to get past it.
We're selling our car. The city wants to eat it. So we're getting out from under it before it disappears. Oh well.
@AlexisNeely Not really. I *do* love & forgive her. There was so much crap she didn't know about till last year. Wish I hadn't told her.
Mommy & me will be fine. Just weird. But YES WE CAN!
@NOLAnotes At least she *wants* to bathe. Good sign, I'd say!
@NOLAnotes Someone suggested an article about absinthe. I immediately thought of you, of course. have to pitch it to my editor.
I'm going to write her a letter. And call her tomorrow.
@NOLAnotes It's on three times this weekend! I hope you're showing it to Sun.
@BlueTeddy I'll tell her that, too. Good lord.
@mariebeausoleil She is. But I wish she would lose it. Because she did many things right.
But what do I say to my mother?
@BlueTeddy Thanks!
@jlvblogger Clark High School. 9th grade symposium of Social studies & English. Coteaching. Very struggling school All students behind.
I'm fine. She needs to know that. All these apologies only make me feel guilty.
My mother sent me an email saying ~again~ that she is so sorry she wasn't a better mother. What am I supposed to say to that?
I think I'm finally starting work on Tuesday. Only took them three & 1/2 weeks. I work four days, then Thxgiving break.
Bryan: Honey, I'm in love. Me: Who is she? I'll kick her ass.
@BlondeByDesign Like u need a reason! Still, California has beautiful weather, ~brown days notwithstanding~ But come to FQ soon!
I like the Cosby shows when Rudy was young y when Olivia was on. The show suffers w/o a young child.
@GentillyGirl PS: is it just me or did it get WAAAYYYY hotter after the hurricane?
@GentillyGirl So true. Must specify in will.
@BlondeByDesign Do you live in San Fran?
@BlondeByDesign Tho, I gotta say that the FQ is small in every way unless you're super loaded!
@BlondeByDesign Which completely throws the bible-thumper theory into question that God was punishing NOLA.
@BlondeByDesign Although the FQ was okay, even during K.
@BlondeByDesign Yeah, you want to come in the spring!
@GentillyGirl There you go! I think I'd like to go out at rush hour so everyone would have to stop & pay attention. tee hee.
@BlondeByDesign Dunno. Haven't seen how big it is. Sounds like you need to visit & take a look!
All the huxtable men are wearing pregnancy suits. Ha!
@sahans Yay for sweet husbands! They're the best. ~non-sweet husbands go to hell, tho~
@BlondeByDesign Tennessee Williams' former apartment is for sale!
@BlondeByDesign Move to the French Quarter w/ me! Just make sure you have a job first.
@BlondeByDesign ewwww. brown air?
@NOLA people: Be happy! My first Jazz Funeral. ~or are we supposed to be sad?~
@lisaheindel It's later than I would think a funeral would happen. But I'm glad it happened. :)
@GentillyGirl That's what it was, right? I really don't know. Never saw one before now.
@GentillyGirl But it's unusual, yes?
@lisaheindel Me either till today. They usually don't go down this street.
Isn't 10:20 pm kinda late for a funeral? not that I'm complaining. That's what we mvd 2 the FQ for. Just surprising.
It went like this: 1 cop on motorcycle, 1 lady w/ umbrella w/ musical notes on it, about 6 musicians, then about 20-30 ppl, then cop car.
@lisaheindel k. i've been here lots of thursdays, but this is the first time I've seen that. Wow.
One lady w/ an umbrella leads, about 6 horns, and a bunch of other folks behind, drinking & walking. Cops fore & aft.
@lisaheindel huh?
Jazz Funeral on my street! ( I guess. bunch of folks playing instruments on the street!)
@WetBankGuy It's his whole story. His insanity was caused by LSD use, mine was genetic or whatever. Less severe, but I still identify.
@sadcox Or are we in the post-ice-cube era?
@sadcox When is Ice Cube day? Have I missed it again?
I fear my insanity is too much revealed by twittering. Still, I'm spending the night with the Floyd & retreating to think. good night.
Admittedly,there's something in Syd Barrett's LSD abuse that makes his insanity less sympathetic. But R.Water's writing is still compelling.
I'm going to listen to some floyd: Dark side of the moon of course.
@terrifik ha! is that in re: my tweet @ the moon or a weird full-moon coincidence?
Then I have a crazy emotional day & the moon looks big. So I look it up & it's a full moon.
All I know is, I've looked @ my star chart & Every damn thing in it is centered on the moon.
Get Ready. Full Moon.
Is it a full moon? Holy crap!
@sadcox Engineers.
@sadcox Sooooo why meet him for lunch?
Just saw a headline, haven't even read the story yet, laughing: Sarah Palin descries extreme partisanship.
@ColonelTribune That's a lot of money not to figure out how to spend before allocating!
Tired. Going to sleep. I'm outie!
@WestleyAnnis Twitter wisdom is that twitterrank is a hoax for phishers to get your password. U should change it.
Ok, every time we see someone w/ that twitter rank thing, we should @ them directly. this RT thing isn't working.
@BlondeByDesign Enchiladas, queso & chips, hummus, fettuccini alfredo, wild turkey, crown royal...
@YatPundit Hopefully ppl don't use same password for twitter to truly critical functions like email, bank accts, etc.
I swear sugar makes me even hungrier. Is it just me? Hungry. Eat sugar. Become more hungry. This is why I prefer cheese, butter & cream
First, we all ran to give over password to twitter rank. Now everyone's overstating the threat. O lordy loo.
@NOLAnotes nite!
@TKPope How about a pic of a 360 being smashed on the sidewalk. ~oops! 360-widow talking~

@NOLAnotes Those are two of the best D'onofrio films I've seen. in that order HA, then TWWW. Although opinions differ.
@NOLAnotes Did you ever see Happy Accidents? or The Whole Wide World?
@robschafer Don't be sorry. It's good you're doing that. Telling the truth. Still, it's not as bad as I thought here.
@robschafer Oh, God. Awful. I'm brave. I'm brave. I'm brave.
@NOLAnotes One of the few I haven't seen! I went on an ebay buying spree a few years ago of D'onofrio movies. There are lots.
@robschafer Apparently nobody gets raped in New Orleans.
@robschafer I have noticed that "rape" isn't a separate category according to NOPD.
@YatPundit Oh, and Marissa Tome is in it.
@YatPundit Oh, it's my FAVE. and my friend in ATL has had my copy for a YEAR. Need to call her @ that!
@YatPundit AND did you see "Happy Accidents"? If not, you should immediately. It's so precious.
@YatPundit Do you remember "Adventures in Babysitting?"
Vincent D'onofrio is the sexiest man alive, hands down. Especially since Heath Ledger died, RIP.
@YatPundit I know, but who else can do it. I skip the off weeks anyway. May as well do it 1/2 as often.
@YatPundit See, the show was ALWAYS about D'onofrio, and no other detective is going to work. it's character driven. its main strength.
Twitter Rank is probably a trick/scam/hoax to get your password. I changed my password & u should prolly do the same.
@YatPundit Gone from CI? And I agree, Eames has really come into her own on that show. Neat to watch the actress grow.
@YatPundit Except: I never watch L & O CI w/ Christopher Noth. It's just wrong.
@hfeldman He's beautiful.
@YatPundit That's my favorite L& O show, tho I do watch them all, intermittently. Goren is sexy, smart, & compassionate. sigh.
@charlotteAsh David Lynch is one weird dude, but I never saw a film of his I didn't like.
I don't understand why the Royal Pharmacy doesn't fix the old fashioned fountain. It's the most unique thing thy have in there. ???
@YatPundit I am totally in love with Bobby Goren of Law & Order CI. ~don't tell bryan~
Bryan: What does that one look like to you, a date rape?
Bryan: that cloud looks like a dog w/ a kid on his back. Me: It looks like a dragon face to me. B: That's b/c you're evil.
It's eerie looking how the clouds are clinging to the tops of the buildings over the city.
in re: heaven: ME: I don't think you have or need sex in heaven. Bryan: that makes me want to fuck more when I'm down here.
@GentillyGirl Your story is truly unique. wow.
GAWD I'm sick of the C. Aguilera target commercial. stop already.
I really feel like crap. All I want to do is lay down & veg out. BUt I told myself no. So now I'm just twittering.
@GentillyGirl Do the doctors say it's the radiation?
@GentillyGirl Are you sure you're okay? Your DNA may have been altered. You should sue.
When discouraged @ teaching I said 2 Bryan: I'm a tool of the man. He said: No, you're a wrench in his plan. I &lt;3 him.
@GentillyGirl Holy shit! seriously? u r kidding, right?
@GentillyGirl Yikes. How did cockroaches figure into this? and why did you stop doing that?
@shercole But really. If they're really suicidal, u can't help them. They need professional help. What good are you if they make u nuts?
@pamelump I'm pretty excited too. I never saw it @ the theater. My whole summer was taken up by moving.
@officemate Careful. I've been holding back!
@GentillyGirl I am laughing at this reactor compartment/roach conversation!
@GentillyGirl Plz explain yourself!
@GentillyGirl I just gotta say WTF???
@GypsyOwl :-)
@shercole U seriously need to set some boundaries. sounds like ppl are manipulating u. Direct them to some real help.
@officemate Still, there are things we tweet & things we don't ~my earlier menstruation tweets not withstanding!~ j/k
@dmcordell But alas, I'm lazy.
@dmcordell So true. still, I think 2 myself... if have to SAY lol, I should work on my wording. sarcasm shld be obvious even on twitter.
@GentillyGirl Some of those roaches have ended up in my bathroom, forcing me to commit murder. Thx a lot!
@officemate Ewww. nose hair = off limits!
What if I formally announced my intention to STOP saying "lol"? would people know when I was being sarcastic?
@sadcox r u an engineer? woah. i knew there was something off about you. lol
I do love that building. I wish I'd photographed the R/W/B last week.
@LilCostello but the big one next to it says "capital one" also. I guess they own the CBD? thx for info & link.
@charlotteAsh the golden man is grafitti? wow
Engineers are strange creatures. Seriously. If you ever knew one, you know what I mean. If you are one, sorry. U can't help it. Build smthg.
@sadcox If I started thinking that way I might become engineer-like. Ewww. Almost as bad as becoming programmer-like. booooring.
@dmcordell Screw em. What's the worst they can do? Annoy some people? I think thy just wanted to make a point.
@charlotteAsh kewl. what is that?
@LilCostello Here's a pic of the one with the lighted dome that changes colors. http://tinyurl.com/5kxhsd
I just got an email about a job as a mechanical engineer. Argument against automated job searches? good lord.
@dmcordell Yeah, I changed my password already. buggers. I shouldn'ta given it to them. I'll prolly never remember the new one!
@LilCostello Yeah, I'm messing with flickr now.
@LilCostello And the one closest to the river that has a saucer-like thing on top that looks like the panopticon.
@LilCostello I'm especially interested in the one right next to capital one that has the lighted dome that changes colors.
Flickr annoys me.
To be a rock, and not to roll.......
Are there any new orleanians who can help me identify the buildings in the skyline?
@jeffreylyons ewwww. sounds boring!
@terrifik ha!
@jeffreylyons Where did you see that? That's both eerie and a shocking misunderstanding of social media.
@terrifik Also, I don't think "we" say "midget" anymore!
RT @bcompton Not looking forward to the army of spambot zombie twitter accounts whose passwords were stolen by twitterank
@terrifik I'm just saying that there's like a billion to 1 shot of being an NBA player. Agents, sports writers, trainers, etc. Great.
Same goes for rappers and football players.
Besides, the NBA doesn't need my help.
I have decided that encouraging the NBA as a career choice for young black males is unethical.
@joegerstandt So teach a class.
@terrifik I agree competely.
@terrifik And some are so serious and dedicated that they resent being followed around w/ pee cups. for 38K/yr

@terrifik Although I take issue w/ measures of teacher "job performance" -- how you define that is, of course, critical. & nobody agrees.
@terrifik in re: your last klan tweet. I should learn to see things so positively. I look to the negative too mch. a weakness.
@terrifik Of course. I'm just saying the job requirements practically preclude drug abuse. Either way, $$ better spent elsewhere.
@Akula You always make me laugh!
@JamiMiami Then call a summit to evaluate the conditions that led to the disaster. Issue a report.
@JamiMiami Serious emergency. Call 911.
Lived in BR for 13 years. Then moved to the FUCKING buckle of the Bible Belt. Then ran back to Catholic country. hmmmm. I'm a methodist.
@terrifik Good way to look at it! I like that.
@YatPundit Out of curiosity, does "protestant" and "wanna be slave owner" go together? Or just 2 disparate facts @ N. LA?
@YatPundit How alarming is it that people from Oklahoma have to come here to join the klan?
@terrifik Teachers don't have time to do drugs. That money should be spent on books, computers, A/C that works...
@YatPundit I thought "No, NOLA is crazy and the rest of the state is FUCKING CRAZY"
@YatPUndit You know what got me? The ppl @ the store where I bought the paper said, "NOLA is normal & the rest of the state is crazy"
@YatPundit Elaborate, please. Oh wise one!
@Illig Ha ha! Did @badbanana write the code for Twitterrank? (and is twitterrank's twitterrank going up b/c we discussed it?)
@YatPundit Ah ha. Good thing they're calling to randomly drug test teachers. That'll fix it. Teachers are all a bunch of thugs.
Grand Wizard's uniform had a patch that said: Kill 'em all, and let god sort 'em out. What is wrong with people?
@TheGilch I saw that movie so long ago, I barely remember it!
RT @badbanana   Good lord. Let me grab my Moleskine and charcoals so I can sketch your resplendent Twitterank.
@badbanana Funny. Favored that one.
Sheriff's job to be aware of potentially dangerous situations. I have to contend w/ cops every day of my life, and I don't even shoot ppl
Knowing about the klan and stopping their little hood-wearing rallies is two different things. Sheriff shld know about gangs, klans, skulls
@AblativMeatshld I nvr said that. I'm saying that NOW that someone has died, the sheriff says he didn't know.I contend he should have known.
@AblativMeatshld never said they should stop it. but if the sheriff didn't even know about the klan in his parish, he's a shitty sheriff.
@AblativMeatshld Well, these particular klan members shot someone in the head when she tried to back out of initiation.
Further, if lots of ppl knew and the sheriff didn't know, what kind of sheriff dept do they have? If he did know... well... i rest my case
I mean, how u gonna miss a Klan rally? Lots of ppl knew. It's just that, well, they're down with that.
am of the opinion that the only way the Klan could operate "under the radar" in St. Tammany Parish is if most of the ppl agree w/ that shit
@guruofsales or do you mean the stock is down? my brain is fuzzy
@guruofsales Google works for me. As does Gmail.
@abigvictory I think it's a scam. No explanation on FAQ.Some kind of experiment into how many wl give out info in spite of big red warning.
In a bad mood. Out for midol, comfort food, and strong liquor. Later!
@fancyfembot Haven't actually done this in about a decade ~just went off the pill~ This really really sucks. I've been spoiled.
@ClareLane Hey, I thought I was polite about it. lol.
Or how many ppl r dumb enough to give out username/password. I was. 95.7. No idea what that means
This twitterrank thing might be horse shit. What "other signals" does it use? It could be measuring nothing.
my Twitterank is 95.07! http://twitterank.com
Menstruation sucks ass.
@overflowinbrain No. Lots of people are having the same problem.
@AblativMeatshld Pretty sad. U should probably bone up on your skills. lol
@loonyhiker Special education teachers rank #5 in those happiest in US with their jobs:-)  http://tiny.cc/2ypRg
@AblativMeatshld What is the meaning behind your twitter name?
@AblativMeatshld Possibly explains why I can't find useful numbers from state dot. This place is corrupt. But that works, thanks!
@AblativMeatshld Thanks. It's a private business that handles this stuff. Weird. Have you ever heard of that?
helicopter low overhead. is this a police state?
@s0ni It's dutchess' birthday? awwww. kiss her for me. ~u know i don't kiss dogs~
@moearora Exactly. When u hang people upside down over balconies, Karma comes back to bite you!
@daddyclaxton Not me, but others are saying that.
@AblativMeatshld I have a number, it's ALWAYS busy. Not initially, but when they xfer me to the right dept. I have an 877#. u know another?
This is hilarious: http://tinyurl.com/6puf52 Suge is suing Kanye West. via @moearora
@moearora That is so ridiculous. Suge didn't know people didn't like him? He gives up 135K jewelry to people who ask?
@robschafer Thanks. I'm going to check it out.
@shercole I just now saw your answer to the ? about the pics. Thanks!
@AblativMeatshld New Orleans, LA
@patrickd88 @kusdiva @whynot88 I don't know what it means, just reporting the email I received!
Just got an email from Obama for America saying the DNC is in debt from the campaign & needs me to send money.
Why can't I find any working phone numbers for the DMV? This is really pissing me off.
It's about to rain. Yay!
Is there a free, easy way to edit photos that allows me to size them for blog headers?
@Akula Mother will they put me in the foreign line? Mother am I really dying?
@kissmykitty Thanks! I'm pressing on! Will @ you if I get stuck.
Struggling with Wordpress, API keys, themes and all that jazz.
@sadcox Which I expected. But it still seemed better than the alternative. sad state of things.
@kevinhendricks Did you unfollow the spammers?
@sadcox His platform has always been to tweak it. ~which i don't agree w/ necessarily~ NOW he's saying it's backburner. Tweaks postponed
@sadcox I've never been involved in, nor had much faith in, teacher unions. So I don't know.
@sadcox But when Obama says Ed. is a backburner issue, I can only assume that means NCLB stands as is.
@sadcox I think the states would have to start refusing federal money, as some have already done.
@sadcox I'd love to get the feds out of Ed. But they are already in it. Not my doing.
@sadcox Oh, about the Obama thing. I thought you were talking about the car thing! ha
@sadcox huh? about what?
@martingruner True, but I seriously doubt the one car per person thing is sustainable, and it's time we dealt with that.
Especially since I was just going through email frm  "final push" of the campaign & O said snd $ b/c 4 more years of same in Ed. won't do.
Civil liberties & Education are already designated as "back burner" issues in Obama's administration. I see why, I suppose. Still sad.
Financial Aid to automakers. Cars are destroying the planet and we want to prop up the companies that make them w/ taxpayer money? oy.
@abigvictory How do you know when your tweets are favored?
@catalyst I'm going to look for it used soon. i try to buy used books as much as possible. perhaps I'll try @luckysnola
Am also inspired to read.... will read some P.K. Dick & go to sleep. Good night!
Am now inspired, once again, to at least purchase The Stand for future reading, since I've often been told to read it.
I love David Copperfield, but have never read it all the way through in sequence. Read the first half about 12 times & picked thru rest.
@charlotteAsh I've always meant 2 read it, but save the super long ones for when I'm sure I can finish. To avoid David Copperfield syndrome
@charlotteAsh Tried to read the Dark tower, but couldn't get into the western thing. + main character = same name as x husband.
@charlotteAsh Nope. So many of his books, and they're very uneven in quaility. My faves: The Girl who loved T. Gordon, the shining, Carrie..
And yet I never saw an R-rated movie till I was 18. I wasn't a sneak-around kid, I was a do-what-daddy-says kid.
@CharlotteAsh I can't believe my parents let me read King when I was 9! I read the shining! Curled in a corner, but read the whole thing.
@YatPundit My own paranormal justice league...
@YatPundit tripping those who deserve it, freaking people out, bopping people on the head...
@charlotteAsh I need to read that one. Also never read Salem's Lot b/c of my longstanding aversion to vampires.
@YatPundit wld like to read that story, tho!
@YatPundit I read stephen king very young. i'm warped.
@YatPundit I swear i did it once! ~i prolly hallucinated~ My brain flexed. Can't repeat it. ~i've already said i'm crazy!~
@YatPundit Exactly. No politics in barroom dancing!
Wishing I could develop telekinetic powers.
@YatPundit Lately figuring that out. Only danced to that one song in the bars in TX. What an idiot. ~him or me? both?~
I'm the oldest. When brother came, I was 5. I asked my mommy if he could move it. I thought it was like an arm or something.
@NOLAnotes Maybe it's just my building. But my fireplace is cemented up, and I was told no fires in FQ. I should find out...
It was my students who told me about David Allen Coe's lynch-mobbin' tendencies. I'm so naive.
I never knew David Allen Coe was a white-hood wearin' bigot. I just sung that song in the bars, "u never even called me by my name" :-(
Kinda strange. So many chimneys in the FQ and no fires allowed. :-(
@chastity526 lol. bryan is a character. he *is* sweet, tho it may not sound like it. he'll say anything!
99% sure I can go to the district office tomorrow w/o getting lost. It'll be the third time I've been there.
Maybe SKV's day should always be the saturday prior to the birthday...??
Can't start Saint Kurt the Vonnegut's Day off w/ a bloody mary this year, since it falls on a weekday. hmmmmm....
@sadcox Wondering if "I'm back, i'm on the rag & ovulating" as a comeback post would lose something since I'm actually a girl.
Me: Nobody loves me. Bryan: Oh, baby. I love you with all my heart and you know it, so shut the fuck up.
That Christina Aguilera Target commercial w/ the superhero look reminds me of Eminem. Didn't he do that years ago? & don't thy hate e/o?
@chastity526 yet another argument for skipping the antidepressants & going walking.
Alarming when Rx commercials for depression warn of suicidal thoughts as a side effect.
Stewie is drunk.
Been watching Little House on the Prairie lately. I think I'm wishing for simpler days.... I do the same w/ Jane Austen.
@HeatherShorter I love Elton. He was my imaginary friend as a child.
When it's winter I bathe all the time. Warm water feels good. But I wash my hair less often.  wet hair feels cold.
@shercole ha!
@shercole While you're at it, get 'em to bring me some hummus!
@KaylaC I do it every time I get in the car. I'm new here, still, so I guess that's an excuse. grrrr
@chastity526 Is there somewhere to line dance in NOLA, or will we have to go to BR?
Spent another day getting lost in New Orleans. Yay.
Smell is gone. Going to bed. Lots of ridiculous errands to run tomorrow. Nite!
@Akula because if you were asked, it is probably b/c you put out good writing yourself. Just be sweet about it. as I know u will
@Pontchartrain Ha ha. that's funny.
Either I'm getting used to the smell, or it's fading.
@Akula I'd say if you're asked to proofread, get it up to the standard you would expect from your own memos, reports, etc.
@Im_X1 Went downstairs instead of calling cops.... hmmmm. Tour guide said he smelled it in front of our bldg. But it seems to be fading nw.
Went downstairs. Only our block. Don't smell it on Royal or Chartres. No gas in this building tho.
@Im_X1 Gonna try the non-emergency #
@Im_X1 Ya think? I am high up and have no idea what it could be...
@Im_X1 I always favorite your book recs!
Horrible, horrible gas/petroleum smell coming from the FQ in the last few minutes.... what is that? Awful!
Now that GW Bush is almost out office, I feel liberated to talk about my home state again. Won't much, tho. Ultimately prefer LA.
I might even buy some boots if I can find some that don't remind me of john travolta, or my cousin the bullrider who broke his ribs.
I need to go dancing, Texas style.
@Im_X1 Read Jurassic Park, Lost world, and Prey already. Other good ones?
@Im_X1 Not so much Timeline? I just read Next. Now jonesing for another....
Who is this Mark Chestnut guy? He doesn't do Friends in Low Places right AT ALL!!!
I want to go back to the Texas club in Baton Rouge.
I call this shit-kickin music. Hubby calls it redneck fuck music. No matter. I do this about 2-3 times a year. Can't help myself.
@s0ni Doesn't that make one look drug-addicted? lol
@liprap Love that article! I don't care if they DIDN'T burn bras, I want to burn mine.
Listening to old country from my childhood. You can take the girl out of Texas, but you can't take Texas out of the girl.
In 37 years of living, about 23 w/ tits, I have yet to find a truly perfect bra. This should be a priority in a consumer culture, yes?
@PreppyDude Does that mean you volunteer to clean my house? lol
Now that all the hoops are nearly jumped, the question remains.... can I connect with these kids?
@s0ni What is a circle lens?
One of my coworkers @ the Bourbon street shop even called me prissy. Whatevah.
I've been called a neat freak, and diagnosed with OCD by more than one person. But this 1830's house is testing my neurosis big time.
@PreppyDude ha! didn't you know I teach public school?
@peneli I love that! Short, strong y to the point.
When our apartment is clean, I absolutely love it. When it's dirty, I want to move.
@s0ni but I guess everyone who wasn't white *was* non christian back then. hmmmmm
@s0ni the fact that she was "moor" and noble is interesting. not only black, but non-christian?
Opened the last diet coke and then lost it. Damn!
Either way, she's not white.
Or is it rude to ask?
In "A Knight's Tale" is Jocelyn black? Not only a woman who's strong, but a black woman?
@ClareLane How about I prove I can do this job by fixing this test for you because it sucks.
@ClareLane Glad you said that because I feel like a bitch when I'm taking a pre-employment test written by morons & I just want to say...
I find it ridiculous to try & answer "essay questions" written by people who never write them. The question is always too vague to answer.
There's an ongoing debate in my house. Verdi Marte vs. Quarter Master. I say Quarter. He says Verdi. If only the Qtr took debit cards...
Going to get some dinner & then home to rest my tired bones. It's a lovely evening. Too bad it'll be dark in an hour.
@overflowinbrain So it worked out to be a backdoor way to notify me that they were following b/c twitter stopped snding notices lately.
@overflowinbrain I do that too! Only sometimes thy quit me & I wasn't following, so i followed & thy followed again.
@overflowinbrain I feel the same way. It doesn't always make sense either, why ppl quit.
House looks great. Laundry incomplete. Feet hurt.
Doing all the housework I was supposed to do yesterday!
So, apparently there's a fight. I'm not a fan of fighting & know nothing about it, so now's as good a time as any 2 say goodnight! bye y'all
Oh no! Olivia is washing her crayons in the washing machine. I &lt;3 this show!
Watching The Cosby Show and wondering why ppl in the eighties didn't know how to match their outfits.
@c3ane I guess it just seems shocking b/c several of my former students were obsessed w/ him & thought he was so hot. i don't see it
@c3ane That makes it less attractive, not more. Either way, he's not attractive to me, with or w/o them. IMO.
I'm sorry to say something so shocking, but Lil Wayne is ugly. Why did he tatoo his face?
@shercole I'm glad you pointed me to imeem. I never used it before. Am now making playlists!
I never watched the sopranos, so I never knew that burnside's song "it's bad you know" was on it. hm
This song is even better: http://tinyurl.com/6ys5l6
Here's an artist I &lt;3 that I found on imeem: http://tinyurl.com/5wjsa5
@shercole thx. :-) I didn't growing up, but grew to appreciate it. ~in elem. they called me "goose" and "chicken" & other stupid birds. lol~
@fancyfembot "Let's look for the purple bananas till they put us in the truck."
@fancyfembot @shercole started it!
I think "When Doves Cry" is still my favorite Prince, tho. I think I'm esp. attached to it b/c my maiden name is Dove.
@Tastelikecrazy hmmm. Let me know if I can help. I don't remember having much trouble tho.
Listening to Little Red Corvette. great one.
@Tastelikecrazy How did it work with blogjet?
@shercole I wanted to marry George Michael. This was before I knew he was gay of course!
@shercole No. It's MD. I never heard this one before. But it sounds EXACTLY like prince.
@shercole New Kids! ha! funny. Janet was cool, tho. I'm listening to your playlist. This sounds like prince? that 7779311 one?
@charlotteAsh lol. I know. I love that album. It was hard to tell mom that when I was in 8th grade tho! lol
@shercole Thriller.
@shercole lol lol. wow. my parents weren't too thrilled @ darling nikki. Can you guess the first album I bought, ever? way famous.
@wirldwyde Jewelry for every occasion is a bit much, and pretty unoriginal. But anniversaries? sure. Christmas even.
@shercole I always liked Prince better than MD. Both are good though. Purple Rain was one of the first albums I ever bought. Guess the 1st.
@dmcordell Well put!
@shercole You can't possibly be old enough to have listened to Morris Day and the Time! lol
My all time favorite quote from this movie: "Call Denmark quick and get a hold of Yule Ulu." ~say that out loud~
@dmcordell i read that in h.s. when i fell in &lt;3 w/ mame! so great! don't like lucille ball as mame tho.
@Im_X1 Did you read "timeline"? I might want to.
@dmcordell i'm just a little less refined than you new york ladies!
Mame is about to ride in a hunt. This movie is so funny!
@Im_X1 Did you read "next"?
@Im_X1 @s0ni sent me the link to the youtube video about him !!! He was awesome!
@dmcordell I've been saying the same. Except I say I'm offended that thy think I'll vote for her b/c we both have tits.
@cburell You're right. she's just so excruciating.
@Tastelikecrazy Is that a group blog you write for? because I have blogjet set up to post to multiple blogs.
@Tastelikecrazy I don't know what savvy source is? must google.
@s0ni I think the parrot could be simply hilarious. I loved him. I wish he were really real.
@Tastelikecrazy That's why I use blogjet now. Not a perfect solution, but better than word.
@cburell I wish the whole conversation about Sarah Palin would just go away.
@damian613 I use a neti pot. I love it.
@wirldwyde Why not?
Mr. Babcock says, "I'm going to turn this kid into a decent, God-fearing Christian if I have to break every bone in his body!"
OMG Auntie Mame is on ch. 12, WYES. One of my ALL TIME faves. The one with Rosalind Russel. She reminds me of my grandmother.
@s0ni It would be hard to make a movie out of that. Lots & lots would be cut.
@s0ni There were about a million characters in that book.
@cburell That is to say every time I leave the house IN THE CAR. I walk most places now.
@cburell I don't have a library card yet, and every time I leave the house I get lost. But I'll get on it soon.
@cburell Have you gotten that quote yet? Sorry I forgot!
@s0ni It would be like a Disney cartoon!
I forgot all about the LSU game. I read that book ALL DAY LONG. Just found out we lost. suck.
@s0ni Although I kept thinking while reading it that it'd be so cool if my pets could talk!
@s0ni That is freaky. Alex isn't transgenic, right? Just an ordinary parrot. I just finished the book. Scary.
@s0ni If this parrot dies in the desert I'm going to be mad!
@s0ni The scariest thing about it is that it's not extremely far fetched!
@martingruner yes. pretty sad. he was fairly young, wasn't he?
@s0ni gave me a book yesterday, Michael Crichton's "Next" and I've been reading it all day. No tweets. Just genetic engineering.
this town is tres confusing.
another idea: label governmental & other major buildings
dear nola: please label streets. kthxbai
Off to see if I can pass an 8th grade test! bye!
3 degrees, 3 praxis tests, teacher cert. & five yrs experience & I still have to take a skills test.but the state can't process rape kits.
@shercole Not anymore... It was a pretty short storm. My internet is screwed up, so I'm in and out of twitter today. :-( Where r u going?
My internet is screwed up. Can't stay long....
@shercole Yes. Let's tweet up!
I am tired. Going to bed. Good night!!! Tomorrow is Friday.
@s0ni @blondie80 I really cannot even believe the prices of toilet paper @ wal-mart! of most things, really. prices have skyrocketed!@
@YatPundit I used to be a blogger. hm. Maybe I'll pick that back up. lol
@blondie80 Now, if something could just be done about South Carolina.
Excited about the great deal I got on toilet paper @ Walgreens. 6 rolls for $3, and it's not that bad. TMI?
@shercole You should make them sign a waiver before 1st date: "all breakups are final"
@blondie80 About time they finished counting!
@shercole Cuz you're the shit, girl!
@TKPope Digital Media company, huh? You could really dazzle 'em at the interview by introducing them to email!
@peneli I don't have faith that posting comment to change.gov is enough.  ??
@peneli I agree about the Fed. Govt. getting its hands out of just about everything. Not going to happen tho.
@MalcomOSX You know, I don't know what it would entail. It would require organization, for sure. Maybe O's ground troops know.
I'd like to talk to someone from the Lower Ninth Ward Stakeholders Coalition.
Would like more information about this classroom corps. http://www.change.gov/americaserves/
i wish it would rain.
@MalcomOSX Well, we should write a proposal and send it to him.
Where will Obama's promise neighborhoods be, and how do we get one in NOLA? http://www.change.gov/agenda/poverty/
@dominiqueminor You still around? Haven't seen you on twitter for a while!
Obama's education plan is incredibly uninspiring. As usual, education is the throwaway issue.
@WillyB Both are true. Most of the jargon used in discussions about education is meaningless. Or means smthg dif. in reality than it sounds
@kusdiva Unbelievable. That's accountability for ya!
Glossary for "education" terms: accountability = control. achievement = test scores
Not especially happy about the Education plan on change.gov. Most of this is already in place, and not working.
RT @c3ane  Obama was not joking about CHANGE. Check out his new site. http://www.change.gov  -- I love this!
@loudmouthman They like her in Alaska. they can have her.
@TKPope Spelling, punctuation I have always known as "mechanics."
@lbilak Yeah, just waiting for now.
@TKPope I always thought no. but Wikipedia says yes.
@TKPope Spelling and word usage are not part of grammar.
@stacey0821 I'm sorry to hear about your uncle.
OK, now I'm sleeping for real. Nitie nite!
@s0ni Must've missed u. I'm just now going to bed. U know I'm an early bird. Was up today @ 5:45 for school.
@patrickd88 This is what you mean: http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/kowtow
Good night twitter folks! I'm so sleepy. Imma watch "the day the earth stood stupid" & go to sleep. :-)
@davidrees Perfect description!
@YatPundit @terrifik Thanks! It was fun. Thanks for your help, @yat!
In all the election hubub, I didn't realize Nick Satan was coming to LSU this weekend. Nuts to him, and the horse he rides in on. etc.
@charlotteAsh Thx! I just realized they changed something that made it seem that @YatPundit, of all ppl, was not sure @ difference b/w cand.
OK, story is up: http://www.secondlinenews.com/
@shercole 1st and 2nd are?
Weird. I just realized I haven't been down Royal St. in more than a week. Discovered Matassa's.
@shercole I want to be a brunette or a redhead!
@shercole I want to get a wig. Went to Fifi Mahoney's the other day and WOW! What fun.
@davidrees Thank you. I voted for him the first time but he was NOTHING AT ALL like I expected. I was pissed w/ him w/in 2 mos.
@barackobama I don't even need a pay raise. I just need the resources to do my job. And your trust/respect for how to get it done.
@barackobama And contrary to common belief, changing that requires something other than a military background. Thank you.
@barackobama They are dropping out because our out-dated schools are increasingly irrelevant & unresponsive to change.
@barackobama And, Powell is right that there's a crisis. But instead of focusing on drop-out rates, focus on WHY they are dropping out.
@barackobama It's like politicians think that teaching is some throw-away profession that anybody can do. Hence the failing system we have.
@barackobama I hope Colin Powell does not become S. of Ed. What are his qualifications for that?
@derekeb I'm already annoyed with that. What are his qualifications for sect. of ed? Fuck. Fuck fuck fuck. Killing does not = teaching.
@derekeb WHAT?? I dunno about that.....
@peneli I know.really sucks. If I could go back to school, It'd be in urban planning. Walkable, mixed-use, mixed-income nbrhoods 4 all!
@derekeb But you might like Dan Carlin's podcast. He's been talking about the broken party system for years. Smart guy.
@derekeb I couldn't care less if thy hve a future at all, really. Simply that there's an unserved need for fiscal conserv. that's not insane
@davidrees Yes, but no more so that Repubs. I hope the R's will squeeze out the neocon influence & swing more libertarian next time 'round.
@s0ni Where are you? Miss your twitterings...
@liprap yes. plz kick them. :-P
@HumidCity It's something more people should explore. Extra disposable income, better health, etc. Don't know why i didn't think of it b4
@davidrees I've been screaming libertarianism for years. But when you're about to go off the cliff, you go for the one that might pull u up.
@seedoflife I have my Geauxbama sticker from the party last night to commemorate. lol
@seedoflife Like Louisiana is some bastion of literacy! I just didn't want to get in the car over it.
Silly.
Closest I ever came 2 a panic attack: on my porch in SC, afraid I'd be raped in NOLA, and afraid I'd be too afraid of it to leave the house.
@HumidCity Thank You! I'm sick to death of hearing ppl say it's SO dangerous. Was really scared at first, but I've not had a problem.
@sevenlies Well, it worked out b/c we had 2 and the other ~the one we kept~ was paid for. Old, but works. We barely use it.
@seedoflife Here, too. By the time I went to get a paper they were sold out.
PS: I resent every dollar I have ever spent on a car. What a load! 1/3 of my take-home just to get to work? Screw that.
@sevenlies I can't afford it either, really. Had to sell a car & walk. But a walkable area was also a priority 4 me. Plus we got lucky.
@shercole Is that a new hairdo on your profile pic? I like it!
@NOLAnotes Exactly. I tried to explain I'm comfortable w/ cities. Grew up in Houston. No talking to them. But they DID help us move to FQ
And they acted like I was just so naive and silly. "Dirty! Loud! Crime!" they yelled.
Those same rural people who never come to town except 4 Saints games told me repeatedly I would be robbed, raped, beaten...
@phdaisy Met. was never really an option. Rural friends looked at me like I'd split in half before their eyes. Glad I didn't bend on that!
@NOLAnotes Those same ppl who told me to live in Met. did so, mainly, because they cldn't BELIEVE I wanted to live in NOLA, esp. FQ.
@blondie80 Yeah, really! When are they going to call that? Crazy. O was speaking & I was still looking up un-called states. anal retentive.
@NOLAnotes I said the same thing, except I said "French Q" - I love our apt, but wld probably have chosen Marigny in hindsight.
@NOLAnotes Everyone we knew told us we should live in, ack, Metairie! before we moved here. Glad I didn't listen.
Blog is working now, inexplicably. Presumably because I was ready to call godaddy about it.
It's cold on the balcony, but pretty warm in the house. Stone walls.
@shercole Like, the suburbs of NOLA don't count ~or don't count as much~ for true nola-native authenticity. ? I'm just new here. lol
@caderoux Still. That's pretty cool. I'm one of the dorks that actually reads plaques like that. Sometimes.
@NOLAnotes Why do they say that? "Nola proper"?
@HumidCity tee hee. okay. I was just hoping never to hear from or about her again.
Case cld be made that my "dominance" of the TV makes me a bitch. But if he wouldn't watch stupid shit I wouldn't be forced to turn it
@caderoux I think the plaque qualifies you! tee hee
Read this about Bush Bullshit in final days: http://www.truthout.org/103108A
@dmcordell I will if I can. Looks like the foundation is out of Napa. http://www.newtechfoundation.org/index.html
@93octaneNOLA I am *gulp* a native Texan. Before that, Scotland is a distant rumor in my family.
@HumidCity I hereby serve you warning that the name Sarah Palin is now officially anathema!
@dmcordell Well, I'm going to have to go on a trip for the school to learn about the program ~visiting a school~ so maybe I'll be near u!
@HumidCity They were probably passing out on your dad's family's front stoop!
@caderoux That's awesome! Ursulines convent is a stone's throw from my apt ~quite literally~ Oct 21 is on my calendar for St. Ursula's day!
@93octaneNOLA I'd heard there were mobsters here! ha ha!
Now WTF is wrong with my blog? dammit!
Story sent to editor. shew. deadlines stress me out.
@HumidCity Wow. I think my family was probably in jail in Scotland or something back then.
@dmcordell Yup. I'll start as soon as the district does their paperwork thing. Friday, hopefully. Maybe monday.
@caderoux Tentatively? Since when are New Orleanians timid? lol.
Isn't the moon lovely tonight? It's a perfectly clear night. And no, I'm not just twittering about the moon to procrastinate!
@charlotteAsh Actually, I'll have it in a few weeks w/ the new job. Thank God.
Raise your hand if you're native.
@peneli I don't think so. ~about the crazy part~
Oh no! blog fail. I gotta finish this story before I can do anything about that.... grrrrrr.
@HumidCity Oh crap! No I didn't know! Thanks 4 telling me.
I really need my health insurance back so I can get my adderall again. I am not functional without it.
@HumidCity tee hee. maybe that's the one that was supposed to write the headline!
@peneli I've actually tried to be super sweet to my plants ever since I saw "The Happening"
@peneli I wonder if trees actually know when they're getting hugged? lol M.Night might say so.
@TweetCaroline Precious!
If one in three took part, and one in three took the day off, what about the other one?
I am confused about this article: http://tinyurl.com/6q4b4g
It can be a silly day or serious. Political, artistic, spiritual, etc.
Am still taking suggestions for the calendar. If you do your birthday, it needs an angle. Like @peneli's "Go Hug a Tree" day.
@Im_X1 Writing for an online publication. I just KNOW there's stuff I miss b/c I don't know enough about this town.
@bodieman Loving the Bloody Mary idea! I think we should wear sunglasses all day.
@peneli Absolutely. May 10 is now dubbed "Go Hug a Tree" day in honor of Penelope's birthday, and that day is now taken.
It's totally weird trying to write about a town as strange & unique & overwhelming as this one when you're new to EVERYTHING.
@SistersTalk And the worst evangelism, too. Good Lord.
@bodieman I've decided St. Kurt the Vonnegut's Day is a permanent part of my year. Just haven't decided how to commemorate it.
@sahans Any homemade soup rocks! Enjoy.
@martingruner Actually, Timequake is one Vonnegut book I never read. [started it, but never finished. curse of library due dates!]
@martingruner hmmm... i wonder if clam is available in Nov?
@sahans What kind of soup? Homemade soup is brilliant!
So, he was a gay, right-wing, bigoted McCain supporter who used the phrase "pro-death."
Asked a man today how he felt Obama's election will impact NOLA, and he said none because "blankety blank blank" racist crap. yikes.
@damian613 So that's August 4. What shall we title this new holiday?
Any Vonnegut fans out there have suggestions for celebrating Saint Kurt the Vonnegut's Day on Nov. 11?
@damian613 I think I'd rather do his b-day. Who knows what moron will be inaugurated on JAn 20 in yrs to come!
@sadcox I'm with you. Except I decided "socialism" was better than constant death, destruction, and demoralization. At least for now.
And I think I'll keep Guy Fawkes day.
I was also making my own calendar. Any suggestions? Days to celebrate? Oct 21 is taken, as is November 11 & July 3.
@MarkDykeman And I'm going to pop in V for Vendetta, because you just reminded me.
I'm pretty sure I talked to Angelina today. She was driving, a do-rag on her head, no makeup, and asked 4 directions. about a 5 sec. convo.
How much a part did racism play a part in Louisiana's going for McCain?
Retweeting @badbanana   U.S. airstrike kills 40 at an Afghan wedding. Must have been a gay wedding.
@Akelaa Or, at least, respect the will of the electorate and refrain from getting in the way!
Who else had a party for Obama last night? ~besides the one at one-eyed jacks?~
I'm really sorry for the sourpuss McCain supporters. ~not much, but a little~ Time to get past it, already.
A nice excerpt from the President's book.we all should read and heed: http://tinyurl.com/5zpqj6
Kitteh thinks I am too senile to remember whether or not I already gave him a can. He does this every day. Silly.
76 Days isn't a lot of time for Obama to pull together his people, but it's way too much time for Bush to do quiet damage while we party.
@ihenpecked Reminds me of a quote from professor Farnsworth, "Yes, it's the apocalypse all right. I always thought I'd have a hand in it."
I'm excited about Michelle Obama. Laura Bush was a mouse. A republican backlash against Hillary. Michelle will be balanced.
@s0ni Can't believe M.C. is dead. Don't know how he managed to hide cancer from everyone. or why he would want to.
Orleans parish voted overwhelmingly for Obama.
@stacey0821 you think you know where it is, then you can't find it! tee hee
ummmm.... i lost  the french quarter.
I stayed up too late last night. Observing at the school today. Out of pocket till later.
@shercole I had to leave pretty early b/c i had to write & get up super early! :-(
Now it's Wednesday after the election. Feels like Monday.
CNN hasn't called NC yet: http://results.enr.clarityelections.com/NC/7937/13108/en/summary.html
@BlueTeddy @patrickd88 Thanks. Cool.
Fuckcing morons are booing during concession speech? Show some class people!
McCain's about to concede.
Ok, I still want to know about florida and NC and the others.
Thank God. Just yay. 8 years of hell are over. So much work to do now.
@s0ni Are you dancing tonight?
We're about to have a black president. We've come a long way.
@fuzzypink I'll go with you. Although I would prefer NYC. ~u know, since we're dreaming~
@s0ni I'm back b/c it was hard to watch the election. too loud & crowded & I have to write a story 2nite & get up @ 5:45 for school
I can't believe so many states are this close. WTF people? There is no justification for the Bush administration. Period.
@YatPundit Ah. If I were in chicago tonight, I wouldn't miss it. Alone or not. I'm a geek.
@fuzzypink They will never do that. They'll try to secede first.
Orleans & Jefferson parish not reporting on SEct. of State Website so far: http://staticresults400.sos.louisiana.gov/11040801017141.htm

@YatPundit I'm surprised you aren't there!
The way this map is shaping up so far says one thing: SOUTHERNERS RUN.
Back to CNN temporarily. I wish they would stop talking about the popular vote.
Back home now. Me & my cspan are together again. but I had fun @ obama party, took a pic, got a sticker, etc.
@stacey0821 I'm 3 for 3. :-(
@GadgetDawg Yeah, he pretty much made his career bashing clinton.
RT @c3ane If Obama wins will Rush Limbaugh explode in flames? I hope so.
@charlotteAsh See, not having my remote is making me nuts!
Having a serious control issue over not having my remote control for this thing.
CNN called Pennsylvania for Obama. Case you didn't know.
I just had my picture taken w/ Barack. ha ha! (he kissed me)
@EssAyKay So, that's 8 for me. It's a lock for O, don't u think?
I also don't like how the CNN interactive map isn't letting me play. It updates automatically. Suck.
What time do the polls close in New York?
@weirdsmobile that's pretty sad.
@liprap I have to write a story tonight & go to school early in the morning, so I might not even make that. suck.
@charlotteAsh That comes to you courtesy of @fuzzypink
@pyyhkala I haven't seen what they have going on tonight, but I almost always watch CSPAN.
At One Eyed Jacks. Not tons of ppl here yet, but everyone's excited. Watching CNN. Not my choice, but ok.
Even though it's going well for Obama, I'm still ashamed of us that it's this close.
@shercole I'm here already. I have a long-sleeved baby blue shirt w/ a wife beater over that says "8 yrs is too long to wait for the big O"
@shercole When r u going to one eyed jacks?
@fuzzypink It's better than the alternative, that's for sure!
@fuzzypink 20 years. Ugh. Thanks for making me count that! lol
@scmommy I lived in SC, and didn't find it a particularly moral place.
@derekeb Yes. I agree. I just expect that kind of exaggeration & misrepresentation from Rush. Rush listeners were voting McCain anyway.
@kusdiva Perfect!
This is unbelievable. Really. This Black Panther thing is completely unnecessary. And this idiot is equating a camera to a weapon.
@kusdiva That's a good one, too. Imma go with "Waiting on the big O for 8 years" or similar.
@fuzzypink I think that's the one! Thanks!
@derekeb RT @WestleyAnnis   RAW: 'BLACK PANTHERS' BLOCK ACCESS TO VOTING STATION... http://tinyurl.com/58vcrg
@derekeb They referred to themselves as "security" -- and one is angrily telling reporter to leave, saying he has "no right to be there"
@derekeb One had a nightstick in his hand earlier & was asked to leave by police. The remaining panthers do not have any weapons.
@derekeb There are 2-3 black panthers at a polling place in pa. really.
I'd almost rather make it celebratory of the end of Bush.
What should I write on my obama t-shirt I'm making?
@NOLAnotes I probably need to get that book. Not much of a cook.
When did/do they count the early votes? It's possible if they've already counted them that votes will be largely in when polls close.??
@NOLAnotes I never actually made meatloaf before!
McCain has "treasure trove" of lucky items: pen, feather, sweater, shoes. This does not inspire confidence.
They're saying 2 Black Panthers are intimidating voters trying to vote in PA.
@sadcox Scary, and funny even. SNL skit material. And tragic. And ridiculous.
@NOLAnotes Me too. Same exact experience. Makes me want to go back to Weight Watchers. I used to eat healthy out....
@WillyB Good luck with that. Getting admin to accept reality in re: internet filters = uphill battle to say the least.
In the event of an electoral tie, one pundit says we'd have an Obama/Palin presidency. Oh yikes.
McPalin running Rev Wright ad NOW? that's slimy.
Blinking out on election talk. Good night!
@Pontchartrain I'm in, if I can play for matches!
@liprap He's pretty cute, if brutish, in AKT.
Or, even what passes for a democracy now.
Access to technology in schools is a necessary right if we're to preserve a democracy.
Seeing how important social media has turned out to be in this election, it would be unconscionable to ban it from schools.
Will says a flower is good for nothing, but he doesn't mean it.
@liprap I need to google that one!
I'm betting if I tried to use twitter in a classroom there would be some kind of bullshit that arose from it. But if Obama can do it...
Noticing the # of blog posts on my blog is inversely proportional to the number of days I have a full dose of adderall. none for a while.
@terrilynnh I'm glad someone could see what I meant!
@s0ni I bet we could make a pretty accurate personality quiz around the sweet pickles characters. u, stork & unicorn! I'd never guess. lol
The cathedral bells and the music for "A Knight's Tale" are oddly appropriate for each other at times.
in Re: "A Knight's Tale": it's a fun movie w/ a hot man in it that animates Chaucer & plays AC/DC. Could I be blamed for liking it?
And Chaucer says what about writers/literacy/schooling?
Bonus Question: If Jocelyn=modern woman's reaction to medieval shit, then Will = ??  Adehmar = ???
Will says, "You lied." Chaucer says, "I'm a writer, I give the truth scope."
And no matter what he was doing, he did it well. Ledger never sucked. He acted.
I hope that wasn't disgustingly inappropriate. He was a sexy man, and likely would have continued that way for some years. He was young.
@shercole Oh, yeah. I forgot I tweeted that! tee hee. I really do love the sounds I hear here.
Watching "A Knight's Tale." I &lt;3 H. Ledger. Sexual fantasies about him just aren't the same now that he died.
@shercole ??? yes? i don't get it?
Cathedral bells are ringing.
@GentillyGirl Yeah, we'll get past it after Thu. She gives us good food, tho! Red beans, chili, jambalaya, and she's really cool, actually.
@shercole K. see you there!
@GentillyGirl She's locked up in her house, so all is well. Thing is, I really like her and respect her. This took me by surprise.
@shercole U bring a camera, I'll bring a laptop, and we'll trade....
My neighbor is MAD, i mean MAD at me for supporting Obama.
@shercole Make sure you tell me tomorrow what you're wearing so I can meet you IRL!
@shercole I'll probably take an old shirt of hubby's and use a marker. Too lazy/busy w/other stuff to get letters. lol
The city really is beautiful outside my window.
@shercole I bet I could make one.... nobody said it had to be a store-bought Obama T-shirt!
@shercole I'm figuring they'll go on sale after the election, like Halloween candy Nov 1.
@shercole Got an extra Obama t-shirt I could borrow? If I spend $$ to buy one, it won't be worth the drink specials.
@shercole Well, mine's insured for everything but gunfire. So I'll be bringing it.
@shercole just called one eyed jacks... they have wifi! YAY!
@charlotteAsh Awesome! This goes along with Kurt Vonnegut's "Blue Monday" thing. He said the same thing about monday & laundry. Makes sense.
@shercole Are you there now?
@liprap Isn't it wonderful?
@charlotteAsh Why do people always cook that on Mondays?
Fighting the urge to bid on Sweet Pickles books on ebay.
Bryan thinks I read "Very Worried Walrus" too often as a kid. Quite the worry wart, I am.
@damian613 Yes. Sweet Pickles never had racism. Although there was a Nasty Nightingale! lol
Thinking about Goof-off Goose, Clever Camel, Worried Walrus, and X-rating Xerxus. &lt;sigh&gt;
@NOLAnotes I think it's the American thing to do.
@NOLAnotes I used to look at the map of the town in the back of the book & make up stories & routes & "find my way" around.
@NOLAnotes Did you ever read Sweet Pickles books? Those were great!
@NOLAnotes So cute! I was just looking at some ebay weebles and some are very different than I remember them.
@NOLAnotes Weebles wobble, but they don't fall down! I have to see that treehouse someday. I'd forgotten all about weebles.
I think we should have a jazz funeral for barack's grandmommy.
Sad that Barack Obama's grandmother didn't live to see him become president.

I just got an email telling me I've won a quarter of a million dollar McDonald's Gift Certificate. Big Macs for Everyone!

@TKPope &lt;all together&gt; Hi Sean!
Just pulled out the winter clothes bins last night, and I'd forgotten about all the clothes I had. It's like I just went shopping.
@sadcox I must have been confused. But that does make it even easier to decide to buy it from amazon, rather than somewhere else.
@YatPundit Too bad you're not here in town for the big day tomorrow.
@YatPundit And what's for lunch?
@shercole Hey, do you know if I can get wi-fi at one-eyed jacks? Going to be working on a story about the election results. wld be great.
@sadcox I don't see a problem w/ the re-packaging of toys....
@EssAyKay Remember your newfound patience & sweetness! :-)
It's only quarter to ten, but I'm tired. Daylight savings time sucks. Good nite, all. I'm going to sleep.
@PreppyDude I think that's the next president's job. To help us do that...
I say we ditch daylight savings time. 3 hours of darkness before it's even 8:00? ridiculous.
Gosh, Maya seems tired & old. Not like "old lady" but like Yoda.
@PreppyDude They do book TV on CSPAN 2 on the weekends. It's a lovely thing!
Maya has over 50 honorary degrees.
I mean "writer WHO teaches" AGH!
Maya is dissecting the difference between a writer how teaches and a teacher who writes.
Book TV is peaceful tv. They stay on one topic a while, no commercials, no explosions or weirdness. Just people talking. I like that!
She says to women: don't whine. you accomplish nothing, and you "let a brute know that a victim is in the neighborhood."
Maya Angelou is on Book TV. Yes, I'm a dork who watches Book TV.
Bryan said 2 a friend on the phone: "You need to check out New Orleans." I thought, "WE need to check out New Orleans!"
Reps. shld have seen more in common b/w Hillary and anyone ~any sex~ w/ smthng to offer besides boobs & note cards.They didn't.says it all.
They had a better chance of winning Clinton supporters by finding somebody strong & smart & able to give Obama a run for his $.
@SistersTalk They compare her in subtle ways by assuming I'll vote for her because she has breasts; like she's a replacement for Hillary.
When I think about it: how dare the repubs compare Palin to Hillary. I HATE Hillary. ALWAYS did. But Palin is a blank. Utterly empty.
@YatPUndit And it seems to me that that says everything. Of course she lies.
@YatPundit Yeah, excpt that she threw her own daughter under the bus in the 1st week of the campaign over the same issue.nobody noticed.
The hibiscus are still blooming. Blooms are getting small, though. This could be the neglect, but could also be the cold. ????
Aloe vera, wandering jew, and a couple of other hardy ones are doing well though. ~all the ones that don't need me!~
I haven't been a good plant mommy. Need to re=pot one poor creature who had it's drain-hole plugged for weeks before I noticed. Soil rotted.
I think I hear Pink Floyd over the rooftops.
This closet is crazy. Gustav took his toll,as we threw shit everywhere, but not having a classroom had a part, too.Tupac can get me through.
Cleaning out the haunted closet that we meant to clean out weeks ago. And playing Tupac. And realizing how much teaching crap I have.
@YatPundit I've yet to hear anyone mention what @overflowinbrain brought up, that Palin herself had her first kid -- gasp -- out of wedlock.
Can I start a mommy blog If I'm not a mommy. I'm tired of the discrimination against childless women!
See? Now, @documentally is going to scotland in the morning & I'm going to the bank & washing clothes. But my life is still very exciting.
@theother66 Likelihood of World War increases proportionately to the importance of mommy's outside engagements, from what I hear.
@kissmygumbo I was actually talking about the parental visit. But that's true, too!
@davwink It was slightly better when husband & I wringed (wrang?) together, doubling the twisting power. Our h20 is soft, and hard to rinse.
@kissmygumbo One might think growing up means we're not freaked out by this, but I ALWAYS am. We'll get each other through it!
@davwink Oh yes.... he's hilarious!
Also, clothes I hand wash & hang on the line are always so hard.
Hand washing clothes is supposed to make them smell good, but mine never do. What am I doing wrong?
My parents (dad & stepmom, so only 1/2 my parents technically) r coming Thu. Am I the only one stressed by parental visits?
Lunch + supper = slunch. Just had hot pockets for slunch. It's a glamorous life I lead. Haters, step off!

@joegerstandt I bought a neti pot at walmart, and it's a great, great thing that you must get today. $15 or so.
@Im_X1 Yeah, right!
@Im_X1 He's not even a native? I'll believe he's coming back when I see it then. He prolly won't!
@Im_X1 Oh, my. That's more than I knew. what do you do? ~not that I've been much better off lately, but i cld keep an ear to the ground~
@Im_X1 When are you coming back? ~to stay, i mean~
@Im_X1 So he thinks he's having more of an influence than he really does. But I'm through w/ it now. How are you?
@Im_X1 But he really does overstate the crime & danger, & did scare me somewhat when I first came here. But my experience didn't jive w/ it
@Im_X1 He's only bothered me from the one, so maybe that's the one I blocked before, thinking the other was phasing out....
@Im_X1 I agree wholeheartedly, but he just told me, before I re-blocked him, that he only sublet his apt in the Qtr & is coming back.
@kareng ha ha! he'll have to get past security.
Maybe I only thought I blocked him. Blocked now for sure.
@kareng I think it has to do with me being new here & he thinks I'm easy to influence.
@kareng That's just it. I DID unfollow & block but he still follows me & steps in w/ rudeness. That's all I was saying...

@MarkMayhew And i wasn't even talking to you. Which is what I tried to make clear when I unfollowed. Clearly, you don't get it.
@MarkMayhew ur incessant negativity is the reason I unfollowed u months ago, but u still reply w/ rudeness to my tweets.
@MarkMayhew But, "I have crack." really?
Anyway, this produce/grocery peddler would do better if I had any idea what he was saying.
@MarkMayhew You/twitter removed your previous reply. But I'm surprised u never heard this guy before. He might have started after u left.
ANd really, do tourists care that this guy has broccoli or chocolate? I can only assume he's talking to FQ residents, & I can't make it out.
Like a flyer that says "I have groceries" or "I have produce" b/c I can't narrow down what he is saying.
He needs to know I can nvr understand rest of that sentence. & that he needs to make a flyer, moving the noun up the abstraction ladder.
There's a guy who goes through the Quarter w/ a megaphone or speaker on his truck announcing his wares by saying "I have ____"
@YatPundit I'm starting to thing that cons like that are the main problem in the educational system in general.
