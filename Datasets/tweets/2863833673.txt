@LDreygo @FaZeClan @karriganCSGO I disagree. Karrigan wants to be an igl. He wants to play. It’s a complete waste of talent just to leave him on the bench. FaZe learned their lesson with Kio.

@RotorBoy95 @xWhosBreezy @FaZeClan @karriganCSGO I agree. In my opinion I believe RobbaN would be better suited as an analyst on this team. He had a baby right around the London Major, and it’s been reported that he wanted to take a step back in order to care for his family. I doubt FaZe will let him go- He’ll stay one way.
@xWhosBreezy @FaZeClan @karriganCSGO I would love to see FaZe try to yield two coaches. Sign Blad3 and YnK. Give NiKo a large support system to allow him to make early round calls. AdreN is really good at mid round calling. This team could work.

@sherylc6 @jpw61299 @KassyDillon Ill be the bigger person and cut this short. You're confused and not listening so im moving on. Have a good day
@sherylc6 @jpw61299 @KassyDillon Apparently not in online discussion nor debate. 		All you've done is deflect and change the subject.
@sherylc6 @jpw61299 @KassyDillon Yup, and I was responding to a guy who said "Morality cannot be legislated" I haven't displayed personal opinions here yet you seem to think I do. This thread is about morality.
@sherylc6 @jpw61299 @KassyDillon Andd here you go again, changing the subject. What is it this time? Oh its Gender interactions and relations. 		This was a conversation about Morality and you're desperately trying to change the subject into a debate.
@sherylc6 @jpw61299 @KassyDillon "Yes. exactly. Morality is considered in Policy creation." And here how both parties abuse that. (Shows examples from both sides) In no way was I making an opinion statement		Im talking about Morality in politics and you're trying to convert this into a Abortion debate.
@sherylc6 @jpw61299 @KassyDillon What I dont understand is what my Gender has to do with any of this. Thats a bit Toxic of you. Not only have you tunnel visioned on an example to change the subject, but now youre trying to use my Sex against me? Sounds a bit counterintuitive.
@sherylc6 @jpw61299 @KassyDillon Im not saying I support either of the examples, I was just showing how Morality is used as arguments in American Policy issues. Yet for what ever reason you're unable to connect my first statement to my example., so you change the subject to something completely unrelated.
@sherylc6 @jpw61299 @KassyDillon Again it was an example as to how republicans use Morality to argue against Abortion. You're missing the point. stop tunnel visioning.
@sherylc6 @jpw61299 @KassyDillon Thanks. I'm glad we've come to the same conclusion, Fuck both parties. 😉
@sherylc6 @jpw61299 @KassyDillon Im not making an argument for nor against Abortion, it was only an example. Stop tunnel visioning. You read the words abortion and immediately go into battle mode. Pipe down. Its only an example.

@sherylc6 @jpw61299 @KassyDillon Yes and thats why we need to end the Two Party System. Democrats are Just as bad as Republicans. Im glad you agree.

@sherylc6 @jpw61299 @KassyDillon Putting kids in cages is immoral- so Lets stop Child Separation policies 		Aborting perfectly healthy Babies is immoral- So lets limit Abortion. 		Those are morality arguments from both sides. neither of which consider Policy factors.
@sherylc6 @jpw61299 @KassyDillon Yes. exactly. Morality is considered in Policy creation. But Value shouldn't be put on an equal footing with pressures such as economic or political factors. Many of these Policy arguments are being based solely on Morality.
@jpw61299 @KassyDillon However I do agree that Morals are Subjective, but unfortunately American politics is heavily Value based. In a perfect world Law is based off Policy, not Values, but its not. Both Sides abuse Morality arguments to bully their ideas into law.
@jpw61299 @KassyDillon You think the Child Separation policy is immoral, correct? I do. Most people do. Other than Values there is no offensive against the Policy. The whole battle over the policy is based of Morals and Values. American politics is heavily influenced by feelings. Morality is legislated

FaZe really need to start checking their angles. This is CS 101.
KARRIGAN OMGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGG
@HazzardCSGOD Honestly I think alot of the players are just not motivated right now. Olof is really testing this core. Its possible that a small change could re-motivate them.
@HazzardCSGOD They can all clutch, but they aren't working together. Maybe they need a new coach. RobbaN has been out for a while. Bring in some new light to the team.
@HazzardCSGOD If I'm FaZe im seriously considering roster moves.
@HazzardCSGOD Yeah. I'm not even sure tbh. I think its a whole bunch of issues. GuardiaN is has consistancy problems. NiKo gets tilted pretty easily. Cromen is actually doing pretty well all things considering. Karrigan has some pretty shit late round calls.
@HazzardCSGOD I get super hyped whenever they make a final. Then they break my heart.
@HazzardCSGOD This is honestly depressing. Olof coming back isn't gonna fix this. Something is up with this team.

@mindylee26 The whole Obama Kenya thing was pretty ridiculous as well, I must say. But I must add, that the majority of the people who endorse that rationale, are in their mid 40s and older. Boomer Conservatives give the movement a bad name.

@HVZURD @tareeq_hxc @MiniMarko7 @JFXVids @FaZeClan @Jaomock @GFuelEnergy @SteelSeries @cloakzy @TTfue @Tennp0_ @Siiimplistic @SpaceLyon Personally, I agree. But I dont think FaZe wants to drop Space. That'd be a snake move.
@tareeq_hxc @HVZURD @MiniMarko7 @JFXVids @FaZeClan @Jaomock @GFuelEnergy @SteelSeries @cloakzy @TTfue @Tennp0_ @Siiimplistic @SpaceLyon I know it isn't. Fortnite Friday is hosted by UMG. I mentioned that event because Hazurd had asked about Cloak and Tfue being a Duo, I was just clarifying.  For the Major, FaZe will likely go with Tenp0 and Space
@HVZURD @MiniMarko7 @JFXVids @FaZeClan @Jaomock @GFuelEnergy @SteelSeries @cloakzy @TTfue @Tennp0_ @Siiimplistic @SpaceLyon Competitively, as far as the reports go, Its just Space and Tennpo on Duos. 	Cloak and Tfue are just selected for Fortnite Friday. 		Its possible, that they will split the 5 members into different duos. But Epic likely will only allow 1 Duo per Org.
@MiniMarko7 @JFXVids @FaZeClan @Jaomock @GFuelEnergy @SteelSeries @cloakzy @TTfue @Tennp0_ @Siiimplistic @SpaceLyon Squads: Jao, Tfue, Colak, Tenp0		Duos/Squads: SpaceLyon and Tenp0 		Hope that helps clear things up :)

@CMasiza I think its disgraceful that the Europeans did just that and worse long ago, and I still think its wrong today. I appreciate your open mindedness. Have a good day.
@frostsgt @KEEMSTAR I'm literally getting autism from the vast grammatical errors in your statement. I actually cannot read nor understand your opinion. No one here said men are superior to women, and if you think that, you're dramatically misunderstanding what everyone is saying. lmfao
@CMasiza The land "not used by anyone" are small pockets of European whites. I'm sorry that the South African parliament doesn't seem them as people, but in a modern world you cannot "take" people's land without compensation.  They're forcefully taking their land, its wrong.
@rachel_morgan97 The whole "so and so are gonna destroy the country if they're elected. So elect me instead" argument has really diminished unification and cross-party trust in one another. You actually can see the trend rise as political campaigns shift to these  strategies.
@rachel_morgan97 I think because of all the slanderous political campaigns that have been run over the years everyone has kinda forgot about that principal. It wasn't always like this. Now its just "This one person or party is gonna destroy the nation"
@rachel_morgan97 Exactly. Everyone is trying to fix the same issues, but we all have different ideas on how to fix 'em. A stable government and society should recognize that and work to integrate/consider everyone's ideas in the problem.

I could literally go on and on as to why Independently ran tournaments do better than leagues and franchises, but no one even reads my tweets, so whats the point. Independent tournaments are always better for the players, the orgs, and the viewers.
If Fornite wants to stand on the esports stage, it has to make things interesting. All ready Battle Royal games are boring and confusing (On average), and regurgitating the same teams and players within the league would only make the esport more boring. @EpicGames, stay hands off
In games like CS, where the only time the Devs are involved are in Majors, you constantly have new teams sprouting up, and proving themselves to the world. In the Overwatch league, the only new teams sprouting up are orgs with multi-million dollar investments. Allow independence
By creating leagues, such as the Overwatch league or NALCS, you limit the new guys, and  teams from being able to develop. In a regulated environment, where the devs call the shots, only the big orgs are able to survive. In general its a bad idea to create a league @EpicGames
Great suggestions, however, Fortnite needs to stay far away from creating a league like LOL or Overwatch. Fortnite esports shouldn't be dictated by EPIC, obviously Majors are ran by EPIC, with rules they create, but private tournament orgs such as ESL should run independently. https://t.co/tS9J9GiAov

@secupp Feminist have themselves and themselves to blame for the word "feminist" being associated with bad things. When the word "feminist" becomes a slur people throw at you, chances are theres negative connotation connected to it.
@secupp Theres instances almost everyday, where men are told that their suffering isn't valid, they're told that they "liked it", told that they, because they're men, cannot be the victim but the oppressor. In the end of the day, Feminist Media cares more about assault directed at women
@secupp I don't think thats the reaction he was going for. I think he was trying to show that Men, just like women can be assaulted, raped, etc. and it feels like men who've suffered those things are kept out and forgotten by the feminist movement, because they focus little on it.

@Fragmented_R @MadsFeltr @_RandomYT In a Utopian world where everyone leaves each other alone,  yes, Anarchy is better than communism and Fascism. But all three ideologies in this world are awful (Don't tell @kieranjhartzell  LUL)
@Fragmented_R @MadsFeltr @_RandomYT I say that all three are equally bad because of one thing-death. Fascism and Communism will always lead to state-sponsored genocide. In Anarchy, as you've stated its a "survival of the fittest". Either your neighbors kills you or the government kills you, either way you die.
@Fragmented_R @MadsFeltr @_RandomYT Even Noam Chomsky, a prominent leader in the Anarchist movement admits that Anarchy is a far fetched dream that wouldn't work. "I tend to agree that Anarchism is formless and Utopian"
@Fragmented_R @MadsFeltr @_RandomYT Anarchy isn't freedom. Unless you're self reliant, you won't survive. The vast majority of Americans need the government in one way or another to survive.
@Fragmented_R @MadsFeltr @_RandomYT All three are equally bad. Communism is Fascism, and you starve in an anarchist society just like you would in a communist one.
I'm not some crazy alt-righter who feels that theres gonna be a white genocide, but don't get me wrong its triggering to watch your country grow more and more left wing everyday.
The feeling that your political beliefs are growing more and more foreign by the day is triggering enough, but the fact that you can't do anything to stop it is even more traumatic.

Libs win on Gun control because they have a plan	Cons win on Border security because they have a plan	Progressives win on healthcare and tuition because they have a plan.	Cons typically win on spending and taxation because they have a plan.	If you actually have a plan, youll win.
To Summarize, just learn from Hillary. Don't spend most of your time refuting your political opponent, and try to change things up. Don't run on the status quo.
You'll never win a campaign off the maintenance of the status quo. If your principals are even remotely familiar to another person's ideals, chances are you'll lose to a person who has a unfamiliar/different POV.
Hillary lost on alot of these topics not only because she didn't have a legitimate plan but also because she spent most of her campaign time trying to discredit Trump. Bernie wins on so many of these topics because he actually has a legitimate plan.
It doesn't really matter what their running on. If you at least have a plan on a certain topic, you'll win on that topic. Libs win on Health-care because they actually have a plan. Cons typically win on taxes/immigration because they actually have a plan.
You cannot win a campaign off refuting your opponent. If you spend most of your time trying to discredit your opponent, you'll lose. In the end of the day, you win elections running on your principals not by fighting a war with your rival. This stands for Libs and Cons.
@Alice_Impala @secupp Her appeal to voters was that she was a woman. If a white man ran the same campaign and principals he would've lost by an even larger margin than Hillary. The fact that we still have to talk about this snake is absurd.
@Alice_Impala @secupp She literally ran her campaign on the fact that she was a woman. She nearly ran a paper copy of Obama's administration. A big chunk of her voters came from the fact that she's a woman. Its ignorant not to believe that. https://t.co/akc9su2uyc

@JosephC71398359 @CovHousePrez @CoryBooker @realDonaldTrump If a Vietnamese immigrant mass raped and mass murdered women, I'd want them prosecuted and deported just like I would with a Honduran immigrant. Stop assuming just because of my skin color and sex that I have some racial bias, I do not. YOU are contributing to the problem. X
@JosephC71398359 @CovHousePrez @CoryBooker @realDonaldTrump Its incredibly difficult to be an illegal immigrant from all the countries you stated. And you seem to think that these people are immune to arrest and deportation, they aren't. You hear less about these groups because they assimilate into American society fast, others don't.
@JosephC71398359 @CovHousePrez @CoryBooker @realDonaldTrump I'm talking about refugees, not immigrants. Two different things. I'm fine with immigrants so long as they do it legally. It shows they're commited to this country and that they care. People need to stop confusing the two.

@AlexDuncan6 @CovHousePrez @CoryBooker @realDonaldTrump I would never imply that its inherently violent.  But certain aspects of their culture along with other factors has a facilitated the growth of these cartels and gangs. Latin America has a slurry of very unstable and poor governments as well.
I cant think of a single Latin American country besides maybe Peru or Argentina that would legitimately take in American refugees at the scale we've done for them.
I can almost guarantee you that the countries in which we take refugees from would never take an American refugee if the US went to shit. But were supposed to care when their culture facilitates the growth of these gangs and cartels. That's my take.
@CovHousePrez @CoryBooker @realDonaldTrump Because of this, I don't give a flying Fuck about those refugees. Trump is doing the right thing by keeping them out.
@CovHousePrez @CoryBooker @realDonaldTrump You know and I know, that those people arent gonna return home after their country stabilizes. We give protections to several different refugee groups, and they never return home. They have kids here and spread their culture that allowed those gangs to exist in the first place.

@AlexDuncan6 @j_baylorcook I agree. The fact that its such a heartbreaking case is why I think rhetoric about such case is being spread, but if you look deeper into the case, you can tell they really did try everything. Thats what ive learned today, thanks for teaching me and holding a valuable discussion.
@AlexDuncan6 @j_baylorcook But for all intensive reasons my original believes on the matter didn't hold much factual weight. Thank you for your insight. Have a nice day/night. Keep doing what youre doing.  👍
@AlexDuncan6 @j_baylorcook As for this conversation, I deeply apologizing for wasting your time. However I also thank you for shedding more light on the issue, for if you didn't I would've continued to ride a wave of rhetoric. Thank you for your time, Ill continue to read into this case...
@AlexDuncan6 @j_baylorcook Okay, I've read up on the court case and it completely contradicts my original thought about the case was. I looked into it further and its apparent that what they did was necessary despite it being a rough decision. I'll adjust my opinion on the subject accordingly. 1/2
@AlexDuncan6 @j_baylorcook I haven't gotten to it fully, but from what I've read its a battle over if hospitals have the right to cease treatment if they deem it "not in the child's interests". If i'm wrong please correct me.
@AlexDuncan6 @j_baylorcook Look im not gonna lie to you, I genuinely don't know what Baylor is about, so I apologize if it comes off as if im defending his politics (I'm not). However I will defend this statement because I believe it has some truth to it.
@AlexDuncan6 @j_baylorcook Really, what I believe the thinking behind doing this is,  it will be an example of why the U.S shouldn't implement such system (Not arguing for or against) .  I think the change that would occur from making the story a big deal is that it will show us how this system could fail.
@AlexDuncan6 @j_baylorcook The kid died like a week ago, change isn't gonna happen with the snap of the finger. This story resonated with Right leaning Americans because it shows what can occur with a universal health care system. This case isn't gonna change the countries that already have it 1/2
@AlexDuncan6 @j_baylorcook I know we won't see eye to eye on this subject. However, I think we both agree that its morally wrong. However, politically, I see it as necessary so that tragedies like these cannot happen again.  Thank you for hearing what i've got to say.
@AlexDuncan6 @j_baylorcook We both know that this image was spammed for over a year straight to push a pro refugee agenda. Its tragic that these things happens, but i'd prefer for it not to be repeated again. If using the child's death as an example is what it takes, then so be it. https://t.co/PYDwca5Kss

@SFSwede @NRSC @NancyPelosi @chuckschumer Ironic because most of the left's economic dreams for america would only work if Big Corporations got bigger. Small Business is obsolete in a liberal's world.
@SFSwede @NRSC @NancyPelosi @chuckschumer Dems tried to make that industry work, but as it is right now, The Solar industry cannot stand on its own two feet. The only way they live is for big corporations to pick up the slack, and I don't think ya'll like big corporations now do you?
@SFSwede @NRSC @NancyPelosi @chuckschumer Oh course they are. Solar cannot survive without constant government subsidy. Thats why we don't like them. Put a Coal Company up against a Solar company, No subsidy, and I guarantee The Coal industry will be cheaper and will last longer.
