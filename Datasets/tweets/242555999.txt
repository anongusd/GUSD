Wanna starve innovation? 		Protect the fossil-fuel industry from fair competition (‚úÖ); 		Give it endless corporate welfare (‚úÖ); 		Provide no revenues for innovation (‚úÖ, except tiny @CCUS fund);
Follow economics rule to put negative externalities in price (Econ 101); 		And you will get innovation out the wazoo.
Want ‚Äúinnovation‚Äù? 		Put a #priceoncarbon, so you can reward investors in #carbon reduction;		Strip this crooked industry of its $700 billon/yr subsidy (just in US, per @IMFNews);
As the truth emerges, they just fall back to a more credible trench to defend the same industry and its same smelly lies and big fat subsidy.  		Give me a break. 		https://t.co/rsGxwlaLsq

#RI needs strong, safe, resilient water and coastal infrastructure to protect us from threats like hurricanes and sea level rise, and to keep commerce flowing in our economy. As a member of @EPWDems, I worked hard to produce a strong #WRDA.
If @FERC votes on electricity rates end in a tie, the proposed rates go into effect automatically with no input from the American people. My bill with @SenMarkey &amp; @SenWarren will let the public protest a rate change even if the commission vote is a tie. It‚Äôs in #WRDA too.
The 2018 #WRDA also includes the SRF WIN Act, a bill I cosponsored that creates a new financing mechanism for water infrastructure.
Another of my provisions requires the Corps to speed up completion of two important #RI projects: dredging the Providence River and the assessment of the flood risk to #RhodeIsland‚Äôs historical structures.
In the 2016 #WRDA, I was successful in including a provision to expand the Corps‚Äô authority to remove debris from the nation‚Äôs waterways. The 2018 WRDA requires the agency to update Congress on how it has used this authority, and make recommendations for potential projects.
#RhodeIsland has a vibrant composite manufacturing industry so I‚Äôm glad another one of my provisions requires the Army Corps of Engineers to report on its research into innovative materials and recommend in which of its projects those materials could be used.
Proud that #WRDA includes my provision instructing @USACEHQ to study the strength &amp; reliability of hurricane barriers that are under threat from rising sea levels and stronger storm surge, like the Fox Point Hurricane Barrier in Providence. https://t.co/0yPFJQQIzw
Glad that the 2018 water infrastructure bill has now passed both the House &amp; Senate! #WRDA will help with important projects throughout #RhodeIsland &amp; give electricity consumers a chance to speak out against unfair rate increases. Those are important wins for our state.

Big #Republican influencers were there at the beginning, the funders behind the organization called the @FedSoc that selected #Kavanaugh. 		(Per White House itself, #FederalistSociety was ‚Äúinsourced‚Äù to White House for this.)
It has been a personal honor to share this moment with these #RhodeIslanders, and to be trusted with their stories, and I am very hopeful the fire they lit will lead to change.
Like the brave #RhodeIsland women who shared their own stories with me this week, Americans are shedding the long and unfair legacy of shame, fear, and stigma associated with sexual violence and trauma, to come forward with their experiences.
Through this dark episode for the Senate and our democracy, I find reason to hope. 		@realDonaldTrump mocked her, and #Republicans ignored her, but Dr. Blasey Ford‚Äôs testimony lit a fire.
She even provided real evidence, including prior consistent statements, to corroborate her account.		We then learned the true measure of #Kavanaugh.		His bitter, partisan conspiracy theories ought to disqualify any nominee to the bench, let alone to the highest court in the land.
Then came credible allegations of sexual assault against #Kavanaugh, and remarkable testimony from Dr. Blasey Ford. 		She was calm, composed, and utterly believable. 		@realDonaldTrump called her testimony ‚Äòcredible‚Äô and ‚Äòcompelling,‚Äô as did many of my #Republican colleagues.
Also, he sides ‚Äì nine times out of ten ‚Äì with big #Republican corporate and special interests over regular Americans. 		Our next justice needs to remain independent of those interests; Judge #Kavanaugh signaled the opposite. 		That cost him my vote.
I developed deep concerns with Judge #Kavanaugh early in this process. 		He holds a narrow view of constitutional protections for women, a troubling affinity for #darkmoney, and a worrying disregard for precedent and important judicial principles.  https://t.co/6ezpimeNRY
To those who still carry their own untold experiences, help is available: Rhode Islanders can call Day One‚Äôs 24-hour helpline at (800) 494‚Äì8100; people will care and understand. #BelieveSurviviors
There is so much promise in this moment. I am so grateful to the women who overcame their fears and trauma to entrust me with their stories.
That kind of ignorance and cruelty is exactly why victims of assault and harassment hold in what happened to them, often for years, sometimes for decades; fortunately, #Republicans and #Democrats alike condemned the president.
#Trump has missed all this. Fixated by confirming another donor-friendly judge, he mocked Dr. Ford at a political rally Tuesday night. 		At first he had called her a ‚Äúcredible witness‚Äù who was ‚Äúvery compelling,‚Äù but then reverted to form, to ridicule her in front of a crowd.
#RhodeIsland is a small state. To have this many testimonials come forward is stunning. 		Senate colleagues in other states are seeing a similar response. 		We are experiencing a deeply important national moment. https://t.co/IQwifoQBJo
And I had significant concerns about his truthfulness and temperament, concerns proven more than justified over the course of these hearings.
his affinity for unlimited and dark political money and his studious blindness to its harms to our democracy; his very selection and support by big special interest groups.
I began with deep concerns about Judge #Kavanaugh: his unfettered view of executive power‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääeffectively believing the President is beyond the law; his refusal to commit to well-established precedents on critical issues, like women‚Äôs constitutional rights regarding abortion;
As a Senator &amp; a member of the ‚Å¶@senjudiciary‚Å©, giving careful consideration to #SupremeCourt nominations is among my most important responsibilities. These lifetime appointments can change not only the course of the nation, but the course of lives. https://t.co/UyXn42fPfx

Thanks to the courage of these women and so many others across the country, we are experiencing a powerful moment.  		We are finally facing up to tough questions about how women have been treated.
‚ÄúPersonally, I don't believe that this should be a partisan debate - it's on the level of basic human rights.‚Äù
‚ÄúI'm writing this while watching the Kavanaugh hearings in between classes. As a survivor of sexual assault myself, I am terrified of what will happen with the Kavanaugh hearings‚Äù
‚ÄúNo matter how much therapy and time goes by, one small statement or physical interaction can trigger someone who has experienced a traumatic assault.‚Äù
‚ÄúThe past few weeks have been doubly difficult with Dr. Ford coming forward and all of the constant news threads and social media threads. I have been triggered with nightmares, fear of being alone, and emotionally wrecked, PTSD and triggers are real.‚Äù https://t.co/gfbRLsdG7P
‚ÄúAs a rape survivor (I was 19 years old-I am now 66 years old) I want you to know that that experience does color the rest of a person's life, informing decisions that you make, where &amp; how you go somewhere, how you raise your children &amp; relate to your husband &amp; all other people‚Äù https://t.co/PpfnQM7zrR
‚ÄúI'm sure my rapist hasn't thought of me since that night 21 years ago either. In fact, he like Kavanaugh would likely deny anything had ever happened, but here's the thing about rape- the victims never forget."
I‚Äôve heard from women of different ages and backgrounds, some who have held their secrets for years. Those I quote have given me permission, even encouraged me, to share their words. For privacy, their names and other identifying information has been removed.
I get mail every day about the various policies debated in Congress. But I have never had mail like this. This is bigger than the fight over a court nomination.
Something very important is happening. Since Dr. Christine Blasey Ford so bravely came forward to tell her story of assault at the hands of Brett #Kavanaugh, many #RhodeIsland women have written me to share their own personal stories of survival.
This incomplete investigation does a tremendous disservice to survivors, who are bravely seizing this moment to tell their stories in an effort to effect much-needed and long-overdue change.
If I had received a report like this when I was serving as a US Attorney, I would have sent it back for more work. Clearly, there were considerable constraints on the @FBI , and those constraints have hampered the sincere and thorough investigation we need. https://t.co/y39pfM53UU

#Republicans should respect Dr. Ford‚Äôs wishes, as they should respect the wishes of all victims of sexual assault.
Next week‚Äôs hearing, as currently contemplated, will be a kangaroo court, because the #Republicans have done everything in their power to prevent the consideration of any outside evidence, whether corroborating or exculpatory.
Even in accommodating Dr. Ford‚Äôs request for a few additional days, Chairman @ChuckGrassley has rejected many of her reasonable requests to ensure a fair process.

#Republicans are jamming Dr. Ford into a ‚Äòtake it or leave it‚Äô kangaroo hearing without even the courtesy of proper investigation of her claims. It is disgraceful. https://t.co/gxN3iqFUAJ
Even John Yoo admits ‚Äúnormal‚Äù would be for @FBI to investigate. Obviously: it‚Äôs about the background of someone whose background they‚Äôre investigating. Not a hard call here, folks.	https://t.co/PBE0jrttOT
I also succeed in including my bipartisan amendment with @SenBillCassidy, which requires @HHSGov to update Congress on a long-overdue set of rules to help limit blocking of important electronic health information.
I've fought tirelessly to fund high-quality medical education for residents training at children‚Äôs hospitals. The bill includes a $10M increase in funding for these hospitals, including Bradley Hospital.
The bill also includes a $2B increase for research through the @NIH &amp; more money for the BRAIN initiative &amp; Institutional Development Awards, which support research centers of excellence at #RI institutions like @RIHospital's Center on Opioids and Overdose.
The bill also includes $350M for the Temporary Expanded Public Service Loan Forgiveness Program to relieve the financial burden for eligible student borrowers working in public service‚Äîpeople like teachers, social workers, and military personnel.
This funding bill will dedicate $3.8B to fight the opioid crisis nationwide &amp; in RI. Some of that money will go to programs created through my bipartisan Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act.
The legislation we just passed to fund federal defense, labor, health, and education agencies includes a number of important victories for Rhode Island.https://t.co/wJCbWCsujM
This likewise explains their refusal to call Mark Judge, the only other person she alleges was in the room during the assault. In what world is his testimony not 100% essential?
The reality is that there is no investigative plan, and the #Republicans don‚Äôt want one, because they want to hang Dr. Ford out there on her testimony alone without any benefit of corroborating evidence.
Really? When? Who will locate &amp; interview witnesses? Has @senjudiciary hired independent investigators we don‚Äôt know about? When will the witness statements be taken? When will they be shared? Will the minority get to call witnesses, or will the #Republicans hold all the cards? https://t.co/MLQxUgKbAW

If #Kavanaugh won‚Äôt insist the @FBI complete his background investigation as to this new allegation, he is unfit to serve as a federal judge. It is not a small matter for a federal judge to participate in a kangaroo hearing.
Survivors deserve to be heard and respected, not attacked and smeared.   #Republicans‚Äô reflexive, dismissive response makes victims like Dr. Ford understandably reluctant to come forward.
As AG, I oversaw our domestic violence unit and I‚Äôve worked with victims for years; the #Republican stampede violates every principle we have learned about respecting victims. They should be ashamed.
More than anything, victims deserve a sincere and thorough investigation that digs out corroborating evidence, not being forced to stand alone with no investigation of their claims. Epic #Republican fail on that.
She has put her own physical safety in jeopardy, coming forward with credible allegations of sexual assault against a powerful man backed by powerful forces; death threats have forced her into hiding.
Dr. Ford is incredibly brave &amp; very credible. Her story is rich in remembered detail, corresponds to facts that are known, and was told to others years before.
.@realDonaldTrump and @SenateGOP should follow protocol and order the @FBI to complete its background investigation as to this claim. This process has been off the rails for a long time now, but the last 24 hours signal a new low. https://t.co/mC6aQonTDq
This morning, the President said it is up to Dr. Blasey Ford to convince him she is telling the truth. That is preposterous. Her story is credible: it is rich in remembered detail, corresponds to facts that are known, and was told to others years before. https://t.co/kmd9lWwLog
One way to insult and disrespect Dr. Ford is to refuse her the basic courtesy of a meaningful investigation of her claim. Any victim deserves that. Why stop the background investigation for this? https://t.co/ynnTbFjrTs

They would also permit sharing of important data on #opioid prescribing &amp; help test incentives for behavioral health care providers to adopt electronic health records.
My provisions would increase the amount of funding allowed for first responder training, #opioid-related infant care, awareness, and recovery programs.
I've been working with #RI‚Äôs recovery community, first responders, health care providers, and others on the front lines of this crisis to put forward practical, effective solutions like the provisions in this bill. 		I am proud to see our work advance.

The spending bill also includes my provision calling on @Energy to study how we can be more efficient with our #energy use during times of peak demand. 		This amendment will show how we can improve the efficiency of the grid, while saving consumers money on their energy bills.
Businesses are coming up with innovative ways to take #carbonpollution out of the air &amp; put it to use. #Carbonutilization is a growing sector in states like #RhodeIsland. 		The spending bill includes my provision pushing @ENERGY to spend $12 million to continue R&amp;D.
In a bipartisan effort, Sen. @MikeCrapo &amp; I worked on an amendment which will provide $20M to create a DOE pilot program to recycle spent fuel. @ENERGY estimated dealing w our existing nuclear waste could cost as much as $100B; this amndt could help alleviate some of that burden.
I‚Äôve long championed increasing the Corps‚Äô role in supporting local efforts to boost ocean &amp; coastal ecosystem resiliency from climate change. The spending bill supports this work.
My provision in the spending bill directs the Corps to explain this funding gap &amp; ensure coastal projects in states like #RhodeIsland are not being shorted.
Under the Corps‚Äô flooding &amp; storm damage program, there's a continuing &amp; unexplained disparity in funding between inland &amp; coastal projects.
This will help clear rivers &amp; canals often loaded with the remnants of their industrial past &amp; other debris that can block redevelopment &amp; use. 		My 2016 #WRDA provision authorized the Army Corps to remove debris from both main navigation channels &amp; recreational waterways.
I‚Äôm glad the bipartisan energy-water spending bill includes my request directing the @usacehq to prioritize urban waterways, like the Providence River in #RhodeIsland, under its expanded marine debris removal authority, which I championed in the 2016 #WRDA.

The #SupremeCourt needs to stand alone, tall and independent, and Americans should feel confident their cases will be decided on the merits, not the identities of the parties or the identities of big interests appearing behind the scenes.
Instead, he ducked our questions and fed us the same ‚Äòconfirmation etiquette‚Äô we are used to hearing from @realDonaldTrump judicial nominees about being an ‚Äòumpire‚Äô calling balls and strikes.
During his hearings, #Kavanaugh could have pledged to help buck that trend, and reassured those with pre-existing conditions, women, consumers, workers, vulnerable communities, or victims of pollution.
That pattern leaves Americans to wonder which of their rights, freedoms, and protections the Roberts Court may sign away next.
The #SupremeCourt gives too many indications of having been captured by the far right. In case after case, the five #Republican-appointed justices band together with no Democratic appointee, and over 90 percent of the time deliver huge wins for Republican and corporate interests

A #RhodeIsland hook: in describing the legislative history of the campaign finance disclosure law, Judge Howell cites a Senate Rules Committee report authored by the chairman, our own Senator Claiborne Pell.
The latest FEC gimmick was to say anonymous spending for political ads could stay secret unless the donor specified which political ad the dark money would go to support. 		Obviously, ridiculous. But it let the FEC keep protecting #darkmoney power.
If you want to read Chief Judge Howell‚Äôs 113-page decision, here it is: https://t.co/kmhgjqGxxG. 		The back story: #Republicans have deadlocked the FEC to prevent election enforcement for more than a decade. 		This order could force the agency at last to follow the law.
With the #VRA gutted, legislatures in states with a history of abuse of minorities at the polls went straight to work passing laws to deny access. 		Let‚Äôs keep up the fight to restore the fundamental protections of the Voting Rights Act.
Today marks the 53rd anniversary of the #VotingRightsAct.

Alexis de Tocqueville observed that the jury should be understood as ‚Äòone mode of popular sovereignty.‚Äô Jury service gives citizens direct exercise of an American constitutional power.
Denying Americans access to a civil jury denies them fundamental constitutional prerogatives. The Founders had more in mind for this institution of government when they protected the civil jury in our Constitution‚Äôs Bill of Rights.
Such victories have allowed corporations to steer plaintiffs out of courtrooms and into arbitration, where the odds can be stacked in favor of big business.
Corporate victories at the Supreme Court have undermined civil litigants‚Äô constitutional right to have their claims heard before a jury of their peers, and have whittled to a nub the protective role courts and the jury system were designed to play in our society.

Next step for the Water Infrastructure Act of 2018? A vote on the Senate floor. I look forward to the bill getting swift consideration before the Senate. Thanks to my Democratic and Republican colleagues on the Environment and Public Works Committee for working together.
The bill requires the Corps to study the durability of hurricane barriers, like the one that protects Providence, in the face of sea level rise and storms. It also encourages the Corps to look to state coastal plans, like @RI_CRMC‚Äôs SAMPs, for future work.
In Rhode Island and across the country, our water infrastructure needs significant investments to keep up with current demand and prepare for climate change. That‚Äôs why I‚Äôm proud this legislation includes a bill I cosponsored that would help finance water needs.
I‚Äôm also proud that the America‚Äôs Water Infrastructure Act of 2018 includes my provision that requires the Army Corps to report on its research and make recommendations on expanded use of composites, such as those made by RI manufacturers, and other innovative materials.
The America‚Äôs Water Infrastructure Act of 2018 will direct the Army Corps of Engineers to complete ongoing projects in RI, including those that address coastal flooding risks and navigation in the Providence River. Read more here: https://t.co/RFKnyzbwuP

That puts @Coastal_Medical $1000/patient/year below the national average. Multiply this by millions of patients across the country and BIG savings are possible.
...and @Coastal_Medical has lowered costs, since becoming an ACO, by $700 per patient per year, accomplished by providing better care and prevention, not by denying services. (Patients love it.)

After that decision, no Republican Senator has engaged on any serious climate legislation, let alone cosponsored one. But this is more like a hostile takeover of the party by a corrupt industry than it is a naturally-occurring Republican point of view.
And the real problem is not Republicans, but Citizens United. Before the fossil fuel industry coaxed that decision out of the conservative corporatists on the Court, plenty of Republicans were working on climate legislation.
Dana has it right. Minor disagreements about nuclear policy would not break Democratic support for a serious climate bill. Nor would variant opinions of people not even in Congress. The problem is absolutely on the Republican side. https://t.co/IGO6aPFHEx

Proper hearings and stakeholder engagement lead to good outcomes.  More support for our bipartisan work. Urgent to get this voted on, as Prime Minister May has urged.	https://t.co/EkxvJNZEpC

This is the kind of good work that can get done here in the Senate when both parties work together and I‚Äôm glad to deliver some wins for Rhode Island families.
The bipartisan budget deal increases investment in medical research carried out at Rhode Island hospitals and universities like @BrownUnversity, @universityofri, @carenewengland
Thanks to Dr. Pat Flanagan and Dr. Beth Lange for their tireless advocacy on behalf of RI‚Äôs children. This is good news for Rhode Island kids.
#CHIP will be funded for the next 10 years! @RIEOHHS @RIKidsCount
The bipartisan budget deal includes a significant increase in funding for community health centers, which provide care for over 160,000 Rhode Islanders. Thanks for all that you do, @RIHCA_CHCs ‚Äì money coming your way!
The bipartisan budget extends the biodiesel credit benefiting companies like @nptbiodiesel!
The bipartisan budget includes $20 billion for federal infrastructure investment. It‚Äôs time to fix and improve our roads, bridges, and ports in Rhode Island and around the country @RIDOTNews @QuonsetRI
The budget agreement we passed in the Senate today will lead to more funding for substance abuse education, expanded medication-assisted treatment, better prescription drug monitoring programs &amp; help states like RI to implement their opioid battle plans. So important.
The budget deal reached includes my bipartisan legislation to combat climate change by putting a dollar value on reducing carbon pollution. https://t.co/B3bIkioOTW
The bipartisan budget deal includes more funding for our troops.
The budget paves the way for $6 billion in additional funding to battle the opioid crisis in Rhode Island and around the country. @RIHEALTH @RIBHDDH
The bipartisan budget agreement passed is a win for Rhode Island families. It moves us beyond the funding showdowns of the last six months, and sets a course to overhaul the federal budgeting process and restore fiscal sanity.
Excellent piece. Budget process needs reform! We need a bipartisan roadway. https://t.co/0Q9e5flsOc

The release of the Nunes memo underscores that there is a concerted effort to undermine Special Counsel Mueller‚Äôs investigation into Russian meddling in U.S. elections and possible obstruction of justice. Read my @PostOpinions op-ed: https://t.co/DMjAsGWJg2
Another big Republican joins the long list of Republicans who admit Russia meddled; virtually no one but Trump denies; and yet Republican-led Congress does essentially nothing about it. Time's a-wasting.	https://t.co/fdmrF2ESHb

I guess if you're an Oklahoman you can look forward to a shorter drive to the beach. And if you're a big-shot office worker you can live in an air-conditioned bubble. But for coastal communities, well, talk to Houston. https://t.co/ACLkST26S2
.@EPAScottPruitt sued the @EPA 14 times to block the Clean Power Plan. He has deep $$ ties to the fossil-fuel industry opposed to the plan. And he continuously denounces it. 	 	He shouldn't take part in any rulemaking related to the CPP. Period. https://t.co/iG2DwTneHb
LIVE NOW on the @SenateFloor for my "Time to Wake Up" speech. If corporate America is serious about climate action in DC, corporate America needs to explain why @USChamber, @API_News &amp; @ShopFloorNAM‚Äîstand so resolutely in the way of climate action. https://t.co/rSLckOB1RW
Thank you Michael for your great work for brave folks on road to recovery. $6 billion on the way to help! https://t.co/3fUfXp9LLm
This is a really good point, and why the amazing work of Coastal and other RI primary care physicians is so consequential: they are delivering better care and better health at lower cost.  America, watch and learn! https://t.co/HRwDcUcB9F

Good that state-run Obamacare exchanges are doing well; good that RI is cited; and nothing prevents state insurance regulators from addressing the no-mandate "adverse selection" problem -- they've been addressing that problem in insurance markets for decades. https://t.co/lJPKkiS2VR

These are exactly the concerns I have raised: once classified info gets dragged into public to score false political points, answering and correcting may cure the falsity, but it doesn't cure the concern of our allies that we can't be trusted with intelligence. https://t.co/vWkjoXLXdC

The bipartisan budget proposal is a good next step to bolster the addiction prevention &amp; recovery programs that are needed to save lives in states gripped by the opioid crisis.
