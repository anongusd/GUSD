@RepSwalwell @realDonaldTrump I am looking forward to your request for historical accuracy is the matter of united states interference in russia 20 th century civil war.
@hamandcheese The ideas you have demostrated , which are good ones in current economic times , were totally unnecessary not even 25 years ago. There is a normalcy bias that is coming on about the need for extra measures that were not needed because of poor fiscal leadership.
@hamandcheese One of the surest ways to call bunk on this type of thinking is to illustrate the flaws of the idea in real world application.
@hamandcheese The problem is today we have people actually believing that this sub standard economic era of america is status quo. Which is hardly the case. This is more like 1980s america only longer.
@hamandcheese The point I was after was a counter to the usual mumbo jumbo about how great things have been during this generation long recession. Being from the 1990s I of course know that is BS on it face as does anyone who lived in america in the 90s.
@hamandcheese There is nothing incorrect about your secnarios and I am certain you enjoy the same cash boost I do buy having no car , no gas bill , no car insurance.
@hamandcheese No you have illustrated there are many was it can work. However , you have not illiustrated any sitiuation that refutes the origional point which is you cannot make it alone , on just 40 hours min wage , with no partners , no assistance , no sacrifice.

@hamandcheese If we add thier standard and add gas and car insurance yor 40 hours of dc min.  wage has no chance of doing all that. And im not criticizing use of etic or any advantage. But my point was a 40 hour a week job alone with noting else will not do it. And it wont.
@hamandcheese After taxes I would say youd be lucky to make your rent working just 40 hours a week in dc. And to be clear we are a minority in the car issue , most people in the civilized world, well first world consider cars a basic need.
@hamandcheese Like you I have never owned a car in my life. Nice to meet another we are rare in this world.
@hamandcheese You indicate that in fact you are currently in washington dc. One bedroom apartments are an avg of 1 k . Utilities even frugal today are likely 350. Food can slide based on person , lets say 300 a month. The smartphone not much 30 maybe , 50 for a data monster.

@justinamash During the cold war political and psychlogical propaganda were used to justify several actions against states like nicaragua. The communist domino effect made every move by the reds a threat , just like terrorism makes everything a threat today.

@ezlusztig To bad congress wrote a provision in the patriot act and freedom act relieving him of that. Also to bad they failed to repeal it earlier this year at vote.
@RealSaavedra You mean like bill clinton did in the late 90s during his scandal with Iraq
@dennis_iams @JoaquinCastrotx At the end of it however I believe this leadership generation is imperalist in nature and the repeal would only last until trump was replaced. These people all had no issue when bush and obama waged endless war in iraq.
@dennis_iams @JoaquinCastrotx Also both parties are to blame for not repealing it as they had the chance to do so this year.
@dennis_iams @JoaquinCastrotx When the patriot act was passed congress gave the president the ability to wage war unchecked , only 13 members of congress voted against this in 2001. Both parties are to blame for it being law.
@dennis_iams @JoaquinCastrotx Why two reasons , one even before the patriot act the executive could act freely for 90 days before congressional approval.

@TheEconomist Or for onnce see the genocidal dictator for what he is , admit that civil war already exists in syria , and bomb assads house.
@TheEconomist Correct bomb all millitary and support sites perpetually until assad steps aside.
@RepJeffries Because you and your republican counter parts will bi partisanly re pass the law as soon as trump is gone. If you do not understand that that imperailist law needs to be repealed permanently , I think you need to suffer it.
@RepJeffries So why did you not when the vote on that issue came up? Barbra lee has been pushing that long before you. All she has gotten is dead scilence. Honestly , even if you repeal that facist imeprialism patriot act trash law it won't matter.

@DLoesch Not only should it be appropriate for anyone to kill a school shooter , the killer of said shoot should have immunity from prosecution and be immune from all civil wrongful death suits. Lets send a clear message as socitey : school shooters have no value.
@DLoesch For that matter , the first responding cop who joined the resource officer in that fire fight was not successful. The point is those who want to do so in defense of children should not be barred by law from doing so.
@DLoesch Anyone representing that armed school resource officers will kill school shooters everytime is misrepresenting the situation. The armed resource officer did not kill either eric harris or dylan kliebold at columbine high, im certain he wishes he had though.

I understan this is from the control not 2 A camp , however , in neo facist america , gun owners are particularly squirley over these matters and no comprimise will be reach through intebtional misrepresntation.
In fact examination of the text shows that this move is one to bar the entire class of semi automatic weapons , not just assault rifles but standard rifles , hand guns , shotguns and a plethora of weapons never used in any school shooting /2.
The problem with this measure is its intentional misrepresentation. Its organizers hammer the line about banning " semi automatic rifles and high capacity magazines" as well as any trained punidt could /1.

@permafrost1979 @2Ddangerously @john_reinhold @ABCPolitics The solution is out there. If the right points are comprimised on by both sides. There inablity to do so is the only thing stopping it.
@BrownAngelEyes_ @rhonda_harbison @HuffPost Well what am l saying the florida state government got that message when a few days ago they changed the law so the next Feis can kill the shooter instead of being said fodder.
@BrownAngelEyes_ @rhonda_harbison @HuffPost So some kids were cannon fodder , perhaps we should change the definitions here , like the one seems to accept the idea that people being cannon fodder is ok. Or laws giving them no chioce but to cannon fodder are ok.
@2Ddangerously @permafrost1979 @john_reinhold @ABCPolitics Your right both democratic and republican inablity to comprimise is the problem.
@redrum0515 @john_reinhold @ABCPolitics 1 cop out of several and the cops were not on the scene after the first shot within five feet of the shooter so its likely in this scenario had he not been cannon fodder , several kids would have died wiating for cops.
@redrum0515 @john_reinhold @ABCPolitics Yes he did the only thing he could by law be cannon fodder. And save kids . Boy I wish the law had let him have a gun he might still be alive , and the shooter might dead saving us tax dollars.
@redrum0515 @john_reinhold @ABCPolitics By the way my disagreement with does not in any equate to me stating the shooter was cool . The shooter was a fruit loop the only consultation I take from this is that he is an adult and florida is a pro death penalty state.
@redrum0515 @john_reinhold @ABCPolitics Btw no commentary twards these miami officers should be inferred from this but , how many kids died or would die ini secnario while wiating for cops. I think that pretty stupid requiring ppl to die because the cops have not arrived.
@redrum0515 @john_reinhold @ABCPolitics No he was a person given only one choice because of law. He was give only one chioce , be cannon fodder. He did not have the choice of say , killing the shooter , I would have not minded that at all. But the law prevented him from making that choice.

@redrum0515 @john_reinhold @ABCPolitics Absolutley , and the state law that barred the coach from carrying a gun as the schools security officer was the best law the shooter could have had on the books to kill the coach that day , by making certain he was unarmed cannon fodder.
@redrum0515 @john_reinhold @ABCPolitics No it caused the coach to die.

@Mototrix @ABCPolitics Make it easier to own a revolver or semi auto handgun. Make it harder and more costly to own more powerful guns. This  is not  a new method. We are currently trying to decline tobacco use by taxing it like crazy.
@Mototrix @ABCPolitics Your the first person who is picking on the ar 15 and there are obvious reasons why. But why not use law to steer appitite to the disire to own lesser firearms . This kills two birds with one stone. Assuming your not a supportof an entire gun ban.
@Mototrix @ABCPolitics Another thing to missing from the aspect here is that the use of the heller decision can be spun to focus the gun lovers attention on thier right to own a certain guns.
@Mototrix @ABCPolitics If we tailor a basic system with a standardof firearm ownership Ill go with the military on handguns , we can create the perception that other weapons are irregular , while not destroying the underlying freedom.
@Mototrix @ABCPolitics Yeah. I mean the deeper I get into it , it is now evolved to the point where individual proven judgement and certification and training are overdue. If it is a right it is a responsiblity.
@dlukasz102 @ABCPolitics I heard that. But I think it was " thoust mayth changeth if thine will be soeth inclined." . They were big on king james styling back then.

@2Ddangerously @john_reinhold @ABCPolitics Thats always an interesting irony right.
@jumpinjonnydee @karenlo_2 @ABCPolitics Yeah I am the freedom over everything guy. This is a rough era for that type.
@jumpinjonnydee @karenlo_2 @ABCPolitics The three legit reasons for guns , food , defense of self , defense of liberty.
@jumpinjonnydee @karenlo_2 @ABCPolitics The of course the opposition doing thier due dilligence found the militia argument and rode it till heller when the feds gave them no out. Now we move on that right in hand.
@jumpinjonnydee @karenlo_2 @ABCPolitics Thus removing the argument altogether by heller. Its is now the right it should be. Now the time for the responsiblity system has arrived.
@jumpinjonnydee @karenlo_2 @ABCPolitics Nunn spends its time challenging overbreadth , heller specifically disqualifes the argument.
@jumpinjonnydee @karenlo_2 @ABCPolitics That was probably the opinion . And it demonstrates the predominate 20 th century cling to the miltia , amendment as a whole argument heller/ mc donald finished.

@TimothyJPadilla @Jrmtactical @StarzFilmz @karenlo_2 @ABCPolitics Oh bet that is a nice one too.
@jumpinjonnydee @karenlo_2 @ABCPolitics Right and from that point ever further discussion relied on the amendment as a whole and it application and meaning as a whole as you pass through burgers time. Heller specifically unbound the right of ownership from the milita requirement.
@TimothyJPadilla @Jrmtactical @StarzFilmz @karenlo_2 @ABCPolitics Well that is interesting , but I am going to stand on that we dont need to arm lazy people who wont take the time to learn to fire thier weapon properly and accuratley. Not a big supporter of pray and spray auto weapons lovers.

@Beth_Herstein @StevoLeblanc @ABCPolitics Backgroud checks incorparated with due process challenges for individuals yup absolutley.
@Beth_Herstein @StevoLeblanc @ABCPolitics Certainly the millitary must know what its talking about thier. But it comes back to that point no I am to a standard of gun ownership because heller has settled individual right , thus appropriatley changing the conversation to reponsiblity of ownership.

@Calimwulf @awalla_ @ABCPolitics @NRA Yup. All lobby group exist for the purpose of making what ever actions are needed to further thier special intrest groups agenda. Im for a flat bar of lobbying , of course Not for the individual as thier freedom of speech should protect them.
@Calimwulf @awalla_ @ABCPolitics @NRA Yes one the establishments biggest bonehead plays in the last 16 years , was the retraction of the federal assault weapons ban in 2004 , a bill advocated by hard line conservate ronald reagan in the 1990s , with broad support across the isles.
@Glen_Pritchard @ABCPolitics Well lets go down that road a moment , were it reversed how do you maintain a non governmental professional militia , to keep the security of a state? In modern terms.
@awalla_ @Calimwulf @ABCPolitics @NRA Stop annoying me with vaild points. 😆
@StevoLeblanc @ABCPolitics So do I . I really do. we have enough issues with stupid policies and stupid leaders for me to have time for discrimination. But that just me.
@Calimwulf @awalla_ @ABCPolitics @NRA As both political parties were president , holders of congressional houses and bi partisan holders of power seats in all states the progress they achieved was quite underwhelming.
@Calimwulf @awalla_ @ABCPolitics @NRA This decision was done in 2008 and 2010 as you know the cases any idea why 50 state legislatures and the federal legislatures have sat around from 2011 forward.
@Calimwulf @awalla_ @ABCPolitics @NRA I'm perfectly fine with the unattached individual right to own a gun without the govts permission. That being said why is it your states are taking so long in creating standards and laws for my right. I did not say I agreed that Gun ownership is not a responsiblity as well.
@awalla_ @ABCPolitics Yes you can. For example my support comes from the 2008 supreme court decision in D.C. V. Heller. Where it was decided gun ownership is an individual right unconnected with the militias. Don't need the NRA with that ruling.

@dpburnette @karenlo_2 @JHLuscher @ABCPolitics Until heller in 2008 , when the supreme court detached the right of gun ownership from the milita clause , it was not an individual right exclusivlely . So what do you disagree with?
@Glen_Pritchard @ABCPolitics Unfortunatley the supreme court tossed out that requirement for gun ownership in 2008 in district of columbia v. Heller.
@jimyoung2817 @ABCPolitics No but on the gun thing after the supreme court removed the militia requirement for gun ownership in Heller , its time to standardize gun behaviors.
@jimyoung2817 @ABCPolitics But specific denial of one group is , it is only not discrimination if it is all or nothing. To be clear again nothing is fine by me.
@jimyoung2817 @ABCPolitics If your talking about lobbying in general , non specific in all areas of policy and lawmaking , a universal ban , oh we're on the same side there , universal denial in that case is not discrimination.
@sebtoh @AP @trencher69 Im gonna go with this , in 2016 , the first six months anyway , 15,521 people were killed by drunk drivers. 5,276 people were killed by guns. Until you pledge your firm support for alcohol prohibtion , I bid you good day.

@karenlo_2 @ABCPolitics Thats the problem . People dont always agree.
@karenlo_2 @ABCPolitics I suddenly feel like im in star wars episode 2. We need leaders who sit down discuss the problem and agree whats best for everyone and then do it.
@karenlo_2 @ABCPolitics I think that heller settled the " its a right " issue , and on that note there is no excuse for it to not transition to being a regulated item , like booze , like cigarettes , like driving etc..
@karenlo_2 @ABCPolitics Yeah saw a great write up on how the idea of licenced guns like cars sorely overrates the design of the driver license system . Pretty true.
@karenlo_2 @ABCPolitics Because again coming back to one of the core points , its not the gun or the ammo its about your ability to shoot.
@karenlo_2 @ABCPolitics As for ammo , you should try restricting powder. I know how to make bullets and the casing is too easy to do. So a person can only have x powder wieght way more effective.
@karenlo_2 @ABCPolitics Limits on guns shure but genral if someone want to make a private firearms muesum law should not impare them. But they can be certified up the waazoo.
@karenlo_2 @ABCPolitics Im totally behind licences. Heller made it clear the gun is the individuals right to screw themselves out of. You non transparent gun sales , we agree there. Storage theft and liabilities are again 10 years after heller sadly lacking in evolution.
@karenlo_2 @ABCPolitics Just clearly and deeply conflicted.
@karenlo_2 @ABCPolitics My govt leaders on that point should easily agree on that. As should the people both liberal and conservative of this nation. However , from historical aspect we are not those two in any way.
@karenlo_2 @ABCPolitics I want be clear here if the united states , my leadership , became in effect and by design as morally evil as hitler's germany or Stalin's USSR , I would be for its downfall.
@karenlo_2 @ABCPolitics Today , it we want a ban because of school shootings , they have a name for this , knee jerk. You want real reform ask your leaders why they are not creating ownership license standards. Ask them why they have not standardized legal code for ownership suspension.
@karenlo_2 @ABCPolitics And furthermore because of the heller scotus decision I view most of the states and the feds as already a decade behind the curve on moving to a correct transition on gun regulation of ownership.
@karenlo_2 @ABCPolitics Were in agreement im not citing the heller scotus decision for no reason.
@karenlo_2 @ABCPolitics To further be clear as well the rescinding in 2004 of the federal assault weapons ban under president bush , was a big mistake. Reagan himself lobbyed for that. Hard line conservative reagan personally lobbyed for that in the 1990s.
@karenlo_2 @ABCPolitics In 1976 the united states congress resotred the american citizenship of jefferson davis the president of the confederacy, while long dead he committed that treason.
@karenlo_2 @ABCPolitics Treason is really a circumstance. Several americans have commited treason famously , thier punishment have been quite diverse in severity.
@karenlo_2 @ABCPolitics If the american govt we actually rin by adolf hitler and the ss the real ones not the fake one in the white house dems want to believe is real , you would allow that govt to exist and just look the other way.
@karenlo_2 @ABCPolitics colonies we were under british law not american. The legal history is different. However , I further reiterate my belief that after the heller decision , the disscusion of the right is now modified to the setting of standards and the process of responsiblity in ownership.
@karenlo_2 @ABCPolitics We have no standard of firearms training and operation. That being absent makes it hard for the courts applying legit due process , to impose a standard of sanctions.
@karenlo_2 @ABCPolitics Yes , heller. On my previous profile I made my position clear that as heller unequivocally decided it was not the govts job to decide the right of firearm ownership , that it was time in that light for imposed responsiblity IE licences.
In reality most supportes of the establishment are the real bots. Thier arguments can be found on any senators website. In fact closer examination reveals that they dont even make point s favorable to thier arguments that thier leaders have not already stated. This is a tell.
The whole bot thing is amuzing. When you think about it a bot is an individual who simply regergitates what they hear. They have no individual thought the matter at all.
@WieserJohn @SuziGoold @john_reinhold @ABCPolitics But i guess that is not a very big deal to you based on your question.
@WieserJohn @SuziGoold @john_reinhold @ABCPolitics I think was probably the 16 ignored elder abuse complaints by police before the woman was lit on fire and burned to death after thier inaction. That could be it.

@trencher69 @john_reinhold @ABCPolitics When you look at it during forced violent conflict , there are way more purple hearts given than bronze and silver stars.
@trencher69 @john_reinhold @ABCPolitics Boy drivers today certainly prove that do they not. However , there is also that millitary test from centuries ago that proves that even in war the majority of individuals activley choose not to kill.
@trencher69 @john_reinhold @ABCPolitics I just read about a case where some moron shot at glass bottles in his apartment. Im for his gun being pulled. No one was killed but I d pull his gun absolutley.
@trencher69 @john_reinhold @ABCPolitics See I dont think pepole who have never done anything criminal should not be allowed to have guns. However once they have proven stupid with them oh yeah.
@trencher69 @john_reinhold @ABCPolitics That is a better way of saying it , that in fact is the way it should be done.
@trencher69 @john_reinhold @ABCPolitics No candians are actually very level headed folks. In fact the only time I have ever seen them violent is when some dummy insults thier beer.
@trencher69 @john_reinhold @ABCPolitics I suppose everyone could carry gas masks although in some american states it is not legal. However , most people understand the fundamental principal that life is not safe , something that americans need to rediscover.
@trencher69 @john_reinhold @ABCPolitics Notice how no one used a vehicle to run them over. Not that anyone would have cared mind you . But it does show a distinct separation in charachter.
@trencher69 @john_reinhold @ABCPolitics Well your car would only get messed up . And there is another overlooked question in your statement . The terrorists left thier van they were on the street with operating cars all around them.
@trencher69 @john_reinhold @ABCPolitics I and I don't accept the red herring argument of an unstable canadian.
@trencher69 @john_reinhold @ABCPolitics No japan never had a terrorist group oh say get it hands on toxic nerve gas , something much harder to obtain than a gun and release it in a public subway , nope never happened.
@trencher69 @john_reinhold @ABCPolitics Can I expect your vote for permanent revocation of driving  rights for drunk drivers that kill people while intoxicated. It is funny how in liberal and conservative states alike no one ever gets around to that idea.
@trencher69 @john_reinhold @ABCPolitics No what your saying is that you place a lower value on the life of the lives of people killed in london by the van , than the lives of people killed by guns. Im sorry but I can not rwait spect that murder is murder it is not a game of degrees. You can not bring a dead person back
@trencher69 @john_reinhold @ABCPolitics And the bigger irony the disconnect in arguement that some how one kind of mass murder is worse than another it like the terrorists really were not bad guys , cause they did not use a gun...never figured out why people think that.
@trencher69 @john_reinhold @ABCPolitics So I can count on your vote to reinstate alcohol prohibition right. Good to hear.
@trencher69 @john_reinhold @ABCPolitics Here is a fact , more americans died from drunk drivers last year than guns. Interesting.
@trencher69 @john_reinhold @ABCPolitics I cant believe people who put coach Feis in the position of being cannon fodder for thier personal opinions but it happened. I cant put how they can claim to respect life doing it as well. It is interesting.
@trencher69 @john_reinhold @ABCPolitics Yeah the terrorist attacks in london where they drove a van into people , like in france. No guns plenty of people still dead. Another thought I dont fault you for having , but a true one still , if a person is looking to kill they will find a way , guns just make it easier
@trencher69 @john_reinhold @ABCPolitics Well there are easily milions of gun owners that did not shoot a school up yesterday. Laws exist to seperate criminals from socitey not prevent them because you cant prevent everything.
@wuommen @MysteryCr8tve @FriesFreedom @ABCPolitics @ljhickey24 Another trained democratic sheep 👆👆👆
@DynamiteAdam @john_reinhold @ABCPolitics Last word.
@trencher69 @john_reinhold @ABCPolitics Im not certain where happens but at some dont you think the reason people are criminals is because they dont follow laws , i dunno just a thought.
@trencher69 @john_reinhold @ABCPolitics Yes like in london were everyone got stabbed to death by terrorists instead of shot.
@DynamiteAdam @john_reinhold @ABCPolitics Last word.
@trencher69 @john_reinhold @ABCPolitics It just whould socitey decided for Feis he should be cannon fodder. I can' t respect people who believe it is okay to create rules that cause the death of innocent people like Feis because of a political agenda. There really is nothing to respect about that.
@trencher69 @john_reinhold @ABCPolitics No im sorry no defelection allowed. Coach Feis would be equally as dead if the shooter had fired a hand gun at him that day. And ill even give you this bone its not a sure had Feis been armed he would still be alive.
@DynamiteAdam @john_reinhold @ABCPolitics Goodbye troll. Im bored . Bored. My niece has better game than you.
@MysteryCr8tve @FriesFreedom @ABCPolitics @ljhickey24 Wow your from washington state. And so basically a practicing communist by that admission. You support the use of the millitary as a domestic policing force. You are the only state that taxes internet. Hypnosis is scientifc evidence in your state. Yeaah.
@DynamiteAdam @john_reinhold @ABCPolitics Dude are like 6 . It is so clear you are under 20 . Go back to telling us how great the recssion was and all about your beloved " greatest " presidents on history bush and obama.

@DynamiteAdam @john_reinhold @ABCPolitics Bro ive finished with https://t.co/geYTfInXLm are a person who is on the side of the establishment a group of cowards that has spent 17 years limiting freedom because they need to feel safe after 9-11. The world was never safe before 9-11.time to burst your bubble.
@KarlisleG Both are equally as bad.
@MysteryCr8tve @FriesFreedom @ABCPolitics @ljhickey24 So what is the charachter? What was it used for? Im not saying your a liar. Well actually yes I am.
@DynamiteAdam @john_reinhold @ABCPolitics And as for your point is as dumb as can be. Any person with gun experience know the type of gun does not matter , it os about how well you shoot it. A good shooter can do more damage with a revolver than an idiot with an ar-15
@DynamiteAdam @john_reinhold @ABCPolitics Your argument is that of the freedom hater . A person who attempts to use technicality , personal prejorative and opinion to try to limit others freedom. You are basically unamerican and I could care less what unamerican ppl think.

@john_reinhold @ABCPolitics And to clarify it is the moral outrage opinion over guns that is the reason or at least one the major contributors to the death of coach Feis.
@john_reinhold @ABCPolitics That correct and your personal opinion that what seems injust to you personally is not a valid reason for invalidating my rights. Furthermore , I deny you this.

@GovPhilScott recently your state attempted to raise smoking to the age of 21 joining other states. Alcohol is at 21 in your state as well , now you want guns to be 21. 1/.
Raising the right to own a gun to age 21 is fine. It is how ever another hay needle in a disturbing trend of stripping adult rights from adults. If wemake adult decisions a 21 year threshold it is time to raise the age of adulthood to 21. No rights , no responsibility https://t.co/UKLXe7OnrZ

@Mad_As_Hell_17 @realDonaldTrump Today the movie scarface could easliy score PG-13 as opposed to its origonal X rating at its first review. As the movies have become more real we need to change the ratings for the psych of thier content not for the general content.
@Mad_As_Hell_17 @realDonaldTrump PG-13 was settled on in 1984 because the corparations did not want interference in marketing to the largest cash spending segment in the population , teenagers. This was ok back then because tech was older and what was released was more limited by tech.
@Mad_As_Hell_17 @realDonaldTrump Execept for the unrated loophole. Video games have ratings as well from E to AO. But honestly , I think we should create PG-15 and finish what we started with PG-13.

@christruane @CNN So its ok with you if people are killed by people who break the law and kill people. You believe that you can place people intentionally in a defensless position. You dont claim any moral superiority in that right. I hope not.
@christruane @CNN Oh thats right they ingored the law. So howd that work out?
@christruane @CNN Guns are illegal in many countries , for example the UK where just last week a man and his were attacked by gun wileding robbers in thier private , wait a minute how could they have guns?
@christruane @CNN Well re read the 9-11 report several individuals committed mass murder of 2000 people , they did not stand trial , they did not spend one hour in jail. Why because they dead . The justice cannot remedy dead. It cannot prosecute dead.
@christruane @CNN Ok in the seattle case of gun theft no arrests were made how did that enforce the law? When a suicide bomber detonates how is the law enforced on the remaining pieces?
@thehill Anti free speech bots flood twitter with russian bot scare.

@dmoore808 @thehill I believe most news is propaganda. Thats why I listen to them all. The old cold war trick. Peel the onion.
@mattyglesias Oh and seriously , washington state in 2017 stated that hypnoisis is " scientific evidence " . Look at my watch : are you kidding me?
@mattyglesias " a person may be convicted of a crime even if it can be scientifically proven they could not have committed it". This is a current law in Washington state lets not start the party yet. Kangaroo courts are not a reason too.
So it can be said pretty directly by this sampling , that western civilization at current is more interested in decrying fox or cnn news than actually defending thier own rights or freedoms /5.
Of the three groups 4 participants are active in the religous discussion , 9 in the issue of sexual freedom , finally over 50 are selecting to spend thier time trying to make either american news station ( fox or cnn) look credible.
Based on the responses ( combined ) and this also from multiple national sources ( ie several nationals of different nations) the results are not favorable to freedom in western civilization. /3.
At current I have three response , conversations/ re tweets / like streams going on. The first is a conversation on the nature of religous freedom , the second sexual freedom , the last is propaganda , the war over which american news station tells the truth /2.
I always talk about how people are more engaged on thier chosen parties propaganda than on what is really happening. 1./
@christruane @CNN Like for example a couple years back a couple guys drove into a pawn shop in seattle @ 3 am cleaned it out hundreds of guns. Did gun laws , even the federal ones you want have any effect on that?
@christruane @CNN Should work however pimply just might eh screw gthe law ill just shoot anyone who gets in my way , steal the gun at night.
@christruane @CNN Cops hate this line for a reason , it is the factual truth about law and order: A law is only a law if you choose to follow it.
@christruane @CNN Ok and lets get back to it if intend to ingore any law you pass and it anyway , hows that gonna work out for you?
@shadowbigtail @thehill Cnn is democratic propoganda. Whats your point. The fool in the room is the one that believes either one is legit.
@therealftj @RitaPanahi @dailytelegraph The law was written in 2014 as part of the sex crimes code in england. But the very notion that a govt can order a person to report thier consentual sexual activity I believe is an act of terrorism itself.
@therealftj @RitaPanahi @dailytelegraph I want to acknowledge as the outsider it is your nation and govt. But , as a final comment l will just say it is inherently dangerous to the foundation of freedom to allow popular opinion or a select few to determine the life choices of individuals.

@christruane @CNN And there tons of federal laws that state clearly " flying airplanes intentionally into buildings is mass murder" they were on the books the entire 20 th century. Guess bin laden didnt look em up. Nah he probably just did not care.
@christruane @CNN Ok so now the problem is that all state allow free travel between each other? Look man why lie just admit stalin was your kinda guy , no need to hide in a closet.
@therealftj @RitaPanahi @dailytelegraph The reason I am on this is world wide there seems to be confusion on this fact for example in the nation of england a man who not convictied of any crime was require to report to police his intent to have sex with any woman 24 hrs in advance.
