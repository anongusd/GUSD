I agree with @amyklobuchar. Poor people should be able to learn how to build and fix my stuff but real college should reserved for us rich people. I don‚Äôt want a bunch of dirty poor kids interacting with our kind. #2020Election #college #studentloans https://t.co/oHAbwWvGp9
At what point does using your child to pimp an extremely divisive political message in order to get on tv considered child abuse? https://t.co/31rSJfJgP8
@charliekirk11 @Hunter3638 Clearly they were asking for it or they wouldn‚Äôt have been dressed that way. Like when a black kid wears a hoodie or a woman wears anything.

@DineshDSouza @Allihottcholol1 As someone who writes a lot of Nazi propaganda @DineshDSouza is uniquely qualified to discuss it.
@BillOReilly The Uber left is a lot like the Lyft left but with more sexual harassment
@TeddyBallgame04 @jeep_sifu Yeah. The 25th amendment to the constitution is unconstitutional
@DVATW Exactly. When a drone strike kills innocent civilians it‚Äôs all the cost of war but if they kill civilians they‚Äôre terrorists!!
It‚Äôs never to early to start a dangerous conspiracy theory https://t.co/00jhcBEnAA

Americans lives were at dangers dozens of people every century die due to people who have crossed the border in an area that would be protected by a wall and we‚Äôre stupid if we don‚Äôt think of them. #maga #buildthewall https://t.co/5t1AaS6Mlf
America should hate an entire religion for 9/11! We‚Äôre a country of hate and religious supremacy! Read the #1stAmendment . It says clearly that Muslims aren‚Äôt welcome here. Duh. https://t.co/jXqGv8y262
I agree climate change is a hoax. The real emergency is our border which is why we need to #BuildThatWall and #buildTheRoof. That‚Äôs not a power grab. @realDonaldTrump is an honest man with a beautiful heart and long fingers. #maga https://t.co/JDZkSfKG4U
I agree. Now that he‚Äôs down to two years, the dust has settled, he‚Äôs gotten his feet wet, now @realDonaldTrump will finally do something as soon as he gets back from #golfing. #maga https://t.co/4URiXYTpaD
@RealJamesWoods I agree completely. Everyone said I was paranoid and crazy for saying these things but if you said them they can‚Äôt be paranoid and crazy because you‚Äôre famous

Yo twitter i ain‚Äôt trying to be scary but there‚Äôs a lot of yeses on this poll right now and it‚Äôs about a civil war. @AOC #GreenNewDeal https://t.co/cbPUhfkUvn
The power has been off for days. The doctors are saying the children are wall deficient. They desperately need a border wall or they‚Äôll die. #NotesFromNationalEmergency
It‚Äôs chaos here at the border. We‚Äôve been hunkered down for hours, heroin and children pelting the roof as the sirens scream. Authorities are saying to stay inside because the streets are full of rapists, thieves, and some good people. #NotesFromNationalEmergency
Well our world has been vandalized by the dangerous ideology of communism. Welcome to America where our opiate of the people is just actual opiates because capitalism gives the people what they want! But also we have lots of religion too #Communism https://t.co/roX1fSbVOp

@DavidJHarrisJr @JussieSmollett We all know you can judge someone by the lawyers they hire. That‚Äôs why @realDonaldTrump is such a saint.
@PageSix It‚Äôd be cheaper to just set up a billboard of her flipping off a poor neighborhood
@debostic @Cernovich @CarpeDonktum It‚Äôs like you can‚Äôt even post a video with stolen content anymore. Fucking censorship man.
@JackPosobiec Fuck twitter deleting our self congratulatory propaganda that uses a stolen song! Censorship!
@CarpeDonktum @JackPosobiec @realDonaldTrump It‚Äôs almost like this contains a stolen song
@charliekirk11 Right?! @senatemajldr was always super willing to work with @BarackObama every step of the way. #maga
We have so many shootings in America we‚Äôve had two major ones in two separate cities named #Aurora.
@TPointUK Exactly right! Capitalism allowed me to achieve my full potential of working multiple jobs to scrape by
@charliekirk11 @AOC Goddamn right. That‚Äôs why @realDonaldTrump never goes golfing and didn‚Äôt hire any of his relatives. All praise trump cuz he makes libtards libtardeder. #maga
@prageru PragerU never fails to spin conservative fascism as good for America. Way to keep up the good work
@KGeorgieva @IvankaTrump More women should follow in @IvankaTrump‚Äôs lead and be born in wealth and fame and then defend the policy actions of a monster. She is truly an inspirational woman of the people.
@THEHermanCain It‚Äôs shocking how people claim other people don‚Äôt understand economics when they clearly don‚Äôt understand it themselves. I don‚Äôt go around criticizing quantum physicists

@DailyCaller Keep burning that coal baby. Fuck the sky with our smoke
@realDonaldTrump @TuckerCarlson Invoking the 25th amendment is totally ignoring the constitution of which the 25th amendment is a part.
@MAGAindex @RyanAFournier I saw him standing under an awning once and he hasn‚Äôt even proposed that we build a roof over America either. Hypocrite. #buildtheroof
@IngrahamAngle Yeah. Boring. Who wants a stable honest person. I voted for a nutjob trainwreck for a reason.
@AnnCoulter Can‚Äôt wait for the next president to take y‚Äôall‚Äôs guns away with the same logic
@kimguilfoyle @DailyCaller Watch as propaganda tabloid covers propaganda moment with no sense of self awareness
@seanhannity Finally talking bout that deep state. Disregard all of @seanhannity‚Äôs own secretive behavior and attempts at manipulation. The real enemy is the good people trying to protect America.
@IngrahamAngle @realDonaldTrump How date they investigate someone so obviously corrupt! Waste of money when his collusion was obvious from the beginning. If I didn‚Äôt want Russia installing a puppet president I wouldn‚Äôt have voted for him. #putin2020 #maga
@charliekirk11 Woohoo! Unlimited power for the president baby!
@TPointUK Come to America guys! Always welcome here and we love your funny accents. You always sound smart even when you‚Äôre saying really stupid shit. Like if you read this aloud it might sound smart but reading your tweet in my head, it sounds so dumb.
@charliekirk11 Boy oh boy would Republicans have his back though. Republicans always put country over party and wholeheartedly respect the office of the presidency.
@TomiLahren @realDonaldTrump Tool Time was a show about an unqualified man pretending like he knew what he was talking about and failing spectacularly in front of everyone. #toolTimeTruth #FactsDontCareAboutYourFeelings https://t.co/t1iS8QLhkn
@TomiLahren @realDonaldTrump Power move! Gotta love @realDonaldTrump using his power to force something through that doesn‚Äôt have the support of the people! Yeah. Abuse that power sugar.
@DonaldJTrumpJr We can do whatever we want because other people would do whatever they want! #maga
@DonaldJTrumpJr What a hypocrite. It‚Äôs the exact same thing to make a joke about something as it is to force women to watch you masturbate and then attempt to make a comeback by cynically capitalizing on the marketability of far right hate. Same thing
@brad43479 @SonnieJohnson Remember folks it‚Äôs tyranny if a democrat copies @realDonaldTrump but not tyranny for @realDonaldTrump because he‚Äôd be the OG fake emergency declarer which makes it all cool
@LindseyGrahamSC @realDonaldTrump Wall-barriers are a lot like walls but they‚Äôre built without congressional approval
@benshapiro I agree. @realDonaldTrump would never exploit anything but we wouldn‚Äôt want to make it easier for @TheDemocrats #BuildTheWall
@TomiLahren Which as everyone knows is how feminists celebrate Valentine‚Äôs Day.
@prageru @amazon @AOC Everyone knows that poverty isn‚Äôt the result of capitalism exploiting labor duh. Unrestrained greed is good in all circumstances and if you disagree you‚Äôre a silly goose.

@RobGeorge @MelissaTweets I wholeheartedly support POC when they support massive businesses. Otherwise fuck em.
@NoahPollak She should never be so mean to known liar Abrams who is a liar and probably lying now. Sign that she‚Äôs a bigot. And when we think there‚Äôs a Democrat bigot they have to resign. If they‚Äôre republicans we‚Äôll elect them president if they say/do much worse.
@RealSaavedra If your opposed to money in our politics influencing our biased support of Isreal even when they do terrible things then clearly your an anti Semite and conservatives hate anti Semites when they call out lobbyists.
@SenShelby Well I‚Äôm glad @realDonaldTrump took a moment to feel happy. He should. Finally building that wall to keep the Mexicans out. Now we just need that roof. #BuildtheRoof
@DailyCaller He‚Äôs making a documentary?
@DonaldJTrumpJr @JordanSchachtel It‚Äôs a total coup. Like conspiring with a foreign power to rig an election in your favor isn‚Äôt a coup but trying to stop that definitely is. #maga
@RepKevinBrady @realDonaldTrump And if you can‚Äôt trust a redneck sheriff in a cowboy hat who can you trust?
@charliekirk11 If you don‚Äôt want a big wall you want open borders! There is no other possibility
@LindseyGrahamSC @realDonaldTrump No better issue than this! How about the roof you idiot?! #buildtheroof
@IngrahamAngle But if you said workers should make more, stating their overall tax deduction is a good way to argue against it. So like it‚Äôs a win win for us baby
@realDonaldTrump @WhiteHouse Holy shit. @realDonaldTrump still has a team?! Good for him
@LindseyGrahamSC Woohoo. Liberals said we couldn‚Äôt cheat and win and boy oh boy were they wrong! Hahaha #maga
@IngrahamAngle And fuck the people trying to get in by pretending to be family. I know they‚Äôre just rapists and heroin in wigs. Ain‚Äôt fooling me.
@PageSix Cuz I‚Äôm single but still wanna give her my money so I can pretend like I‚Äôm a part of her life and feel less lonely. It‚Äôs cool.
@RyanAFournier That‚Äôs only a small dent in it. We need 100 billion to #buildtheroof. Mexicans have catapults. We need a roof!!!
@PageSix Omg I‚Äôm not the only one
@AOCpress @JackPosobiec Haha. Cuz we‚Äôre supposed to not like him cuz for some weird reason he doesn‚Äôt like fascist @realDonaldTrump, a real man with big hands and a normal penis.
@IngrahamAngle We need money for the roof. #BuildtheRoof
@seanmdav So we‚Äôve found a Russian collusion story that conservatives are willing to believe.
@UniteAmerica1st @FBI @realDonaldTrump There is so much violence against our President and he has only ever promoted a message of peace and love!!!!
@PageSix Finally. My life was incomplete without her contributions to it. All praise celebrities for being celebrities. It‚Äôs the height of achievement. Famous=good
@Heritage It‚Äôs all the innocent gun owners that are hurt by this. I just want a little device that can kill dozens of people easily and serves no other purpose. But i won‚Äôt use it for that. I‚Äôll use it for something legal like target practice. I‚Äôm not a murderer. I‚Äôm just practicing
@LindseyGrahamSC @itsYourGrace @senjudiciary I don‚Äôt understand how anyone could be biased against trump. Like imagine if someone said we‚Äôd get destroyed if we elected him and we‚Äôd deserve it.
@Discoveringme40 @seanhannity @realDonaldTrump And everyone knows that @realDonaldTrump is all about ending corruption and increasing transparency. Hence his love of the press and his openness about his own finances #maga
@seanhannity Whew. Well at least they discussed it. I was worried nobody thought twice about just handing things over to known sex machine @realDonaldTrump. #maga
@JessieJaneDuff @realDonaldTrump Opted for the ransom note graphic design team I see. Appropriate

@charliekirk11 Y‚Äôall remember Benghazi?
@IvankaTrump I‚Äôm glad all the big employers are getting together to best decide what‚Äôs best for employees. Can‚Äôt imagine how they‚Äôd possibly be a biased source on how to treat workers.
@RealJamesWoods You owe every conservative tabloid an explanation. Lawmakers should be constantly harassed by rightwing organizations until they get mad and then we get to be like ‚Äúu mad bro?‚Äù It‚Äôs perfect.
@benshapiro Pure sex
@NoahCRothman @benshapiro Just like there‚Äôs only one type of capitalism and it‚Äôs responsible for any capitalistic state that has a bad economy.

@ChuckLane1 @benshapiro @realDonaldTrump Polls are all bullshit unless they like @realDonaldTrump and then they‚Äôre good polls with good results.
@RepKevinBrady Transparency now could lead to even more transparency later. It‚Äôs better to just trust @realDonaldTrump and his big muscles and beautiful hair. #maga
@seanhannity Of course he should. We just let any old brown person in when we should have a wall that funnels them through checkpoints so we can verify their whiteness. Duh. #BuildTheWallNow #BuildTheWallAndCrimeWillFall #BuildtheRoof
@benshapiro These two situations are identical and anyone that disagrees is a libtard fascist. That‚Äôs why @benshapiro has been such a strong defender of @CNN everytime @realDonaldTrump attacks them. Shapiro is all about honesty and consistency. #maga
@charliekirk11 Everyone should see this. These are facts you can‚Äôt just make up. We know exactly what @realDonaldTrump is worth because he‚Äôs been extremely transparent with his finances. Like when he immediately released his tax returns and divested his interests. #maga
@AG_Conservative @benshapiro Attacking @CNN and referring to them as the enemy of the people is exactly the same as refusing to talk to a conservative tabloid. #maga
@DonaldJTrumpJr It‚Äôs a deep state witch hunt led by the Illuminati who hate @realDonaldTrump because of his huge muscles and hands and wall building abilities. #maga
@RealCandaceO @EllenPage @Ilhan Yeah. Everyone knows that it‚Äôs the muslim majority in America that prevent the gays from having rights.

@CNN Political prisoner? Is there a political argument for drugging and fucking women against their will?
@seanhannity And everyone knows that the lawyer of the person under investigation is the best source for unbiased claims about the investigation
@HillaryClinton If teen girls did it in America we‚Äôd all take that as a sign it‚Äôs some dumb shit.

@seanhannity Republicans just found no wrong doing of the leader of our great party, beautiful @realDonaldTrump. A man with a plan and big hands. #maga
@kimguilfoyle @charliekirk11 @realDonaldTrump We need a roof!!! #BuildtheRoof
@DanCrenshawTX @BetoORourke We chant build a wall for years but when they call it a wall they should know that we really mean fence.
@seanhannity Everyone should love @realDonaldTrump. @seanhannity is right and he‚Äôs a totally unbiased source with no shady connections to the president.
@IvankaTrump @WhiteHouseCEA A sign of a truly great country is how many women are doing manual labor just to survive. #maga
@EWErickson @benshapiro Even when. Clearly most of the time he‚Äôs lying but even when he decides to say something true just once they don‚Äôt acknowledge it and sing his praises. It‚Äôs cuz they‚Äôre biased. #maga

@IngrahamAngle I don‚Äôt care how much money it takes. We gotta stop these brown people from flooding into our country. It makes me sick to think about.
@benshapiro she got some years wrong in a joke. What a retard. She should be like @realDonaldTrump who is always honest and accurate.
@IngrahamAngle Support @realDonaldTrump. What he says is right. I‚Äôm so sick of democracy standing in the way. Who cares what the people want? If Trump says it it‚Äôs right. #maga
@IngrahamAngle Yeah. Really we need unlimited funding for a wall. And the roof. #buildtheroof #maga
@benshapiro Yes! Exactly. People shouldn‚Äôt have a platform or be allowed to express unpopular opinions. I‚Äôm with Ben. #benagainstspeech

@realDonaldTrump @TVAnews Coal is pretty good but I feel like we could burn tar or hazard chemicals. Why not? That shit is wicked hard to get rid of. Burn it and make energy. Duh.
@TomiLahren @realDonaldTrump Fuck yeah. I‚Äôd love to see a fight between the two of them. Solid wall muscle man @realDonaldTrump just wailing on young fit @BetoORourke. Trump‚Äôs tough. Tough trump. Not a spoiled inheritance baby at all. Tough street guy with big hands and muscles. #maga

@TomiLahren Yeah. Be more like @TomiLahren who is nothing but inclusive.
@charliekirk11 Yeah. Everyone knows that just because they already live in states heavily favored by the electoral college, and the census represents residents not citizens, doesn‚Äôt mean we shouldn‚Äôt favor midwestern voters even more since they‚Äôre mostly like us. üòâ #kirkisright
Wow. @realDonaldTrump is such a terrible president that he‚Äôs ruining the name Trump.
Omg. @JudgeJeanine is such a terrible person a jury was willing to believe that Robert Durst was willing to dismember the body of his only friend rather than deal with her.
@yaf @benshapiro @realDailyWire Right?! Just because the system has benefited us greatly doesn‚Äôt mean that our adamant defense of the system is biased! It just so happens that the best system is also the one that benefits me!!!
@AnnCoulter Right?! I‚Äôm white and I feel like nobody even cares about me anymore. Why isn‚Äôt everything made just for me like it used to be?!
@RealCandaceO @AOC Yo. Yeah. She‚Äôs a totes idiot. That‚Äôs why I like @realDonaldTrump cuz he‚Äôs the kind of leader that has balls. When Saudi Arabia murdered a journalist he did the right thing and took their side immediately. Cuz we hate journalists but love isreal!!!‚Äô
@MattWalshBlog @benshapiro Haha. Stupid vegans. We meat eaters are the vast majority so we gotta assert our dominance in society over the weak vegans. Go eat meat!
@realDonaldTrump A wall is just the beginning!! We can‚Äôt limit ourselves to 2 dimensions in a 3 dimensional world. America needs a roof. #BuildtheRoof
@RealJamesWoods Everyone knows there can‚Äôt be two racists in the world so trump can‚Äôt be a racist just because he supports white supremacists, uses racist speech, or promotes racist policies. Duh.
@CHSommers @benshapiro @reason @VolokhC When I thought the dumb libs were gonna be silent on this he was a villain that represented their hypocrisy on race but now that their calling for his resignation I think they‚Äôre unfairly vilifying a great man even though I used to hate him cuz he was a dem.
@thehill The true spirit of the country is defining success as ridiculous affluence built on a system of corruption and expoitation! If you want money you should shamelessly exploit labor and the system! If not you‚Äôre lazy and don‚Äôt deserve an education or healthcare.
@gameopsgirl @benshapiro @ayasgirl @realDailyWire @JeremyDBoreing I can‚Äôt imagine why @gcu thought @benshapiro was divisive.
@WatchChad @DonaldJTrumpJr Yeah. After I ignored all of the stupid libs demanding his resignation I was like, ‚Äúwhere are all the stupid libs demanding this dude‚Äôs resignation?!‚Äù
@benshapiro It‚Äôs weird that this christian college wants to preach of message of inclusivity over divisiveness. Clearly they‚Äôre all awful people for not wanting someone to come spread conspiracy theories and bash stupid libs.
@bennyjohnson @DonaldJTrumpJr Yeah. Libs are stupid. And I don‚Äôt like anything they like cuz they‚Äôre just stupid pussies. Now they‚Äôre saying he should resign so I love blackface and they‚Äôre trampling all over his free speech.
@DavidAFrench @benshapiro Yeah. If they don‚Äôt let @benshapiro speak it‚Äôs because they fear debate. Not because he‚Äôs a known liar and idiot. They‚Äôre just pussies who think we don‚Äôt matter. But we do matter dammit. I‚Äôm important.
@charliekirk11 @gcu @benshapiro This is outrageous!!!! How dare this institution make its own decisions?! Just because the great @benshapiro is a known liar associated with blatant and racist propaganda is no reason for the liberal elite at this conservative school to exercise their rights.
@charliekirk11 @JudgeJeanine @FoxNews I agree that we need a wall but what we cannot go on without is a roof and nobody is talking about it. The moment mexicans learn to use a catapult we‚Äôre gonna really wish we‚Äôd built that roof. #BuildtheRoof #wallisnotenough
@charliekirk11 @realDonaldTrump Omg!!!! Same. Every time I hear him yell about how all the people that aren‚Äôt fans of his are idiots or that he knows everything I get a little bit more swole in the nethers. He‚Äôs just so damn sexy. I get it. Im totally with you.
@TomiLahren Join me tomorrow to protest funeral processions. Far too many of our brave boys in blue are lost to this travesty. #BlueLivesMatter #ThinBlueLine #truehero
@WhiteHouse Fuck yeah. Build a big ass wall but like make it glass so we can go oggle the victims like at a zoo and we can pay admission and it‚Äôll pay for itself.
@RealJamesWoods Pffff. You‚Äôs right. I mean she ain‚Äôt ever play hades in a Disney movie so she straight made of dumb. With her big dreamy smile and AH!!! I hate her and her stupid ideas that makes sense. I wish an old white man would say these ideas so I could believe them.
@TomiLahren If you ain‚Äôt all about the border wall you gotta hate all walls. Like if you don‚Äôt wanna get stabbed you ain‚Äôt allowed to use knives ever. Good luck cutting that steak with a spoon pussy.
@TomiLahren Yeah. He‚Äôs a crybaby for protesting police brutality but I‚Äôm not a crybaby when I complain endlessly about liberals just existing.
@charliekirk11 Conservatives are ... just racists
I‚Äôve noticed a severe lack of microbreweries in predominantly minority areas so I‚Äôve decided to do something about it. #ForThePeople #BuyAmerica #breweries4brownpeople
@charliekirk11 Right?! Like I already have healthcare so why do we need to spend money on it? But it‚Äôs like duh we‚Äôre still mad there‚Äôs all these Mexicans here. What‚Äôre Dems doing bout that?
@alezander I love making people feel all shitty for my amusement. I‚Äôm like what you thought I was being for real? Haha. Nah bitch. You‚Äôs just a thing here to amuse me.
@TomiLahren Oh boy. We talking about social media echo chambers up in this social media echo chamber. It‚Äôs like staring into infinity.
@BuckSexton I‚Äôd absolutely give my phone to police because they‚Äôve always been extremely nice to me and are clearly on my side. Idk why everyone doesn‚Äôt see that
@iamcardib Omg!!  Yes!!! We need more unqualified celebrities in politics!!!! I jam to your bops and love your clap backs!
