@GOP Yes, but since the climate change is a national crisis, once we win the Whitehouse, we can declare an emergency and then the Green New Deal will be law! Thank You @realDonaldTrump for setting the precedent for some BIG wins after 2020! #Dumbasses
@GOP #ExecutiveTime
@NewAmericanDay @KenPaxtonTX @realDonaldTrump @TXsecofstate @GOP @CKinstitute @AFP Yes, the 40% of Voters who belong to a political party have a low IQ but 60% of the voters who are NPA support us when we don’t run shitty candidates like Hillary.  Now, go away and support you lazy @POTUS. #ExecutiveTime		BTW, Trump won b/c...	https://t.co/lN3W7IBJAe
@NewAmericanDay @KenPaxtonTX @realDonaldTrump @TXsecofstate @GOP The polls we took clearly showed us winning, and then @CKinstitute ordered his deep state @AFP to smuggle in illegal voters by truck.  Mexicans love @GOP, they protect employers who hire them.  	Proof of GSP, #VoterFraud!:	GOP wear red!! https://t.co/PixwzScPtG
@KenPaxtonTX @realDonaldTrump @TXsecofstate 🙋🏻‍♀️The @TXsecofstate discovered that the last @GOP SOS appointed by the @GOP Governor had 95k illegals registered to vote in an election where Cruz &amp; @GOP was LOSING BIG &amp; surprised all with win⁉️		THIS IS  @GOP #VOTERFRAUD! No wonder TX doesn’t want to #BuildTheWall‼️ https://t.co/IBPk0uWM0r
We are going to start holding hearings in Russians, and @Steph93065 is the first Russian we are planning to subpoena. https://t.co/kVHcJ6uovh
@realDonaldTrump Here is our first offer:	We will give you $11.4 Billion for the Wall (twice what you are asking) if you take @JoeManchinWV so we can run someone who is part of @TheDemocrats and not a @GOP provocateur!	#TrumpShutdown2019	#TheWall #EndTheShutdown #ForThePeople #Medicare4All

@realDonaldTrump How did you hold those primaries so quickly?  We thank you for supporting democracy!
Remember the holocaust victims, but forget the prisoners @KamalaHarris forced into wild fires, the people she allowed @stevenmnuchin1 to steal homes from, and the campaign donations she accepted to let him do it. https://t.co/cRBEgeNZj5
@Big_Chillin_Tho @_____1_12 @BernieSanders We are democraps, this is the thought process we love!  Only a deplorable would dare disagree!
@GOP @realDonaldTrump Great leadership in caving to us!  😂😂😂
@POTUSKamala @Mel_Ankoly @BernieSanders We can set up a meeting for you.  Just donate lots of 💰 the way @stevenmnuchin1 did, and she is all yours (literally).
@_____1_12 @BernieSanders Well said!!  This is the most reasoned and thought out argument out there!!
@Vinnn_Sp @vicki_soto @BernieSanders Because, unlike the people we have chosen, like @KamalaHarris, he may actually serve the people, not the billionaires who fund all our campaigns.  That would be really really bad!!
@BernieSanders Stop saying this!!  You may spark a revolution, and if you do, who is going to give us the 💰 we need to keep power?!?!
@OFB2020 That’s stupid!  Why would we support #Bernie2020?  Not only does he preach #Medicare4All, if elected, he may try to actually make that happen, and that would really piss off our owners, I mean donors.
@veggie64_leslie Want us to support #Medicare4All?  Sell it to our owners, I mean donors, first.  When the insurance industry, trial lawyers, and #BigPharma tell us they are ready to give up all that 💰, then count us in, but not before!	#ForThePeople with 💵💵💵	Not #Bernie2020, #NeverBernie!
@TexasDamnit @HDemocraps @JaredBeck @KamalaHarris @TheDemocrats “The Emails” 🤮. You really think facts matter?  That is too funny!!
Why is #Bernie2020 trending?!?!?!		He has learned NOTHING!  @KamalaHarris has already been chosen by our owners, I mean donors, and we don’t need someone trying to copy her fake messages about universal health care and other 2016 Bernie Platform issues!	#NeverBernie
@medusapeluza @HDemocraps @GOP @Paduch @TommyHicksGOP @SpeakerPelosi Don’t give the @GOP all the credit!  @BarackObama solidified Bush’s temporary tax cuts into law, gave Wall Street a bailout, and protected billionaires from prosecution for crashing the housing market.  Wall Street ❤️’s us, and we 💙Wall Street too!  #ForThePeople who pay us!!
