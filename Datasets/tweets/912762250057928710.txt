Goodmorning,	    The word of the day is	MOROSENESS. To have a very serious, quiet, gloomy, unhappy disposition.
We often take our bodies for granted. Allowing them to plummet with physical and mental stressors. #BeStressFree
Motivation begins from within. Allowing yourself, to withhold, the strength to proceed, is a first step in conquering your depressors.
Life can get so overwhelming that we allow an enervating, lackadaisical, feeling to consume our whole being.
Goodmorning, 	The Word Of The Day Is, LACKADAISICAL.	   To demonstrate a lack of interest or enthusiasm. Lacking life, spirit, or zest.
