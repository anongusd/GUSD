While there isn't a general or primary  election in Delaware this year, his words ring just as true now as they did then. Today and every day, we must remember the sacrifices made by our ancestors, our predecessors, and our contemporaries like John Lewis. 2/4

And Latinas have the largest gap, making 54 cents on the dollar. This is unacceptable. Strides have been made towards equal pay for equal work, but we still aren‚Äôt there yet. Read more about #EqualPayDay here. https://t.co/MiJcow7jZG
African American women are paid 63 cents on the dollar, compared to working men -- meaning they have to work until August 7th, more than a half a year later, to catch up.
Why is today #EqualPayDay? According to research, working women in America are paid just 80 cents on the dollar, compared to working men -- meaning they have to work 20% longer to catch up. And for women of color, the pay gap is much wider.
