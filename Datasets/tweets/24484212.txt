A lot of sudden-experts on 702 on Twitter, so here's my take: When I lived in Las Vegas, I had a phone number with a 702 area code, and life was pretty great.
But perhaps the most important thing is this: it passed. Historic, once-in-a-generation tax reform is now law of the land, and already, Americans are seeing the positive benefits with higher wages, more jobs, and a growing economy. That, after all, was the point.
For his part, @SpeakerRyan toured factories and met with workers on shop floors in MD, PA, WA, OR, WI, MA, and more. Total video views from these visits? 6.2 million. https://t.co/2Z9G2rr48X
As for his claim that "real people were altogether absent." ... WRONG. Dozens of 'real people' joined at the unveiling of the legislation: https://t.co/RA1lDpGIZZ. And members of Congress met with 'real people' in hundreds of events all across the country.
It doesn't fit the author's cherry-picking narrative, but for @SpeakerRyan, tax reform was always about the results, not the messenger. That's why in the year leading up to its passage, he tweeted about it nearly 500 times, generating 83 million impressions.
I always appreciate constructive criticism, but this is just a sales pitch from a Monday morning quarterback at a California communications firm. He touts the promise of social media, but personally has only been on Twitter since October 2017. https://t.co/gk16MRQOP7

December 20th. President Trump congratulates @SpeakerRyan on a job well done in passing and putting tax reform on his desk.
