@NsfwWx Puts NYC right on the mix line?
@NWSNewYorkNY @nynjpaweather @AMSweather @MikeBWeather 		4.6 inches of snow in Bayside, Queens. Still coming down. Northeast corner of Queens
@MikeBWeather what did it show? thanks!
@AMSweather the timing of the storm would be all day saturday?
@wunderground Are these the weather channel's old graphics? looks likes it. I think they changed most of them recently
@MikeBWeather What are you thinking for the sunday to Monday system? Thanks as always!
@NsfwWx you think we have the chance for at least 1 inch in NYC? thanks for the info by the way
@ericfisher @ryanhanrahan wasnt it 64 inches?
@weatherwilly That band will move up into NYC?
@jhomenuk this is valid at 6 p.m.?
@jhomenuk does that travel north up into NYC a few hours later?
@NsfwWx you think this includes NYC? thanks!
@NsfwWx Any thoughts about Wednesday
@NsfwWx 1-3 inches for NYC a safe bet? Thanks!
@MikeBWeather Is this storm more focused on new England or maybe NYC as well? Thanks!
@_NEweather What does this mean for us exactly? Thanks for keeping it real as always! Good info too
@NWSNewYorkNY @weatherwilly @MikeBWeather @nynjpaweather 		Pure freezing rain and sleet here in Northern Queens. Nice icing on top of a 2 inch sleet and snow event
@weatherwilly you think we have an all out sleet and ice storm in NYC this afternoon and evening?
@nynjpaweather That is heading towards NYC?
@MikeBWeather Any possibility of that?
@greetandtweet @NWSSeattle And a winter storm warning wasn't issue for Seattle with 6 inches of snow? How come?
@RoKhanna There have always been intense hurricanes, floods, fires. We just keep building up areas where it is most pronte to. Ecologicl devestation always happens after natural disasters, we just hear it more now due to internet.
@AMSweather so basically they're giving the finger to those that cancelled winter?
@NWSSeattle What is the threshold for a winter storm warning to be issued in Seattle/Everett/Bellingham? Thank you!
@NWSDesMoines @iowadot how much snow has des moines seen this season?
@weatherchannel wasn't that the name of a winter storm 2 years ago? We're recycling winter storm names now? Unless I'm mistaken, correct me if I'm wrong
@weatherwilly What position should that vortex over the north atlantic be in to have a higher chance of snow
@NWSAPRFC Does he live in this small town of Bettles?
@iCyclone @Motorhead77 Great report, as always. Some of the best insight out there when it comes to weather chases. Way beyond the usual video only posts that go down during the storm.

@NWSJacksonMS what is the snow accumulation threshold for a winter storm warning to be posted in central Mississippi
@_NEweather does anyone here know where I can find the link to that image? Thank you
@_NEweather looks like most of america isn't doing so bad thus far this winter. Just I-95 and Southern New England states
@jhomenuk What's a negative NAM
@NWSNewYorkNY 	Just out of curiosity, how come a wind chill advisory isn't in effect for NYC. I've heard wind chills will be dropping down to -20 late tonite, early am tomorrow. What's the threshold here?
@AMSweather I remember that winter. Only about 7 inches in Nyc
@AWxNYC @NsfwWx bayside, to be exact
@AWxNYC @NsfwWx it has switched over to big snowflakes in queens
@weatherwilly I remember during the March storm of 2017, after the initial heavy snow, NYC saw about 3 inches of sleet. Heavy sleet the whole day. Briefly turned to rain. Wonder if (not accumulation wise), that scenario could repeat tomorrow night, sunday morn?
@weatherwilly seems like there could be a lot of sleet in NYC after the snow. Depending on how cold the lower atmosphere is will affect how long it takes to change to rain I assume?
@DanLeonard_wx And eventually that heads over to the north east doesnt it
@_NEweather so you think the 06z nam is onto something?
@ericfisher @Eweather13 NYC seems to be right on the 32 degree line
@weatherwilly @AMSweather I remeber that storm. A decent 4-6 inches of snow in NYC before turning over to all freezing rain and sleet. A little backside snow too
@AWxNYC seems like the 18z model suite has shifted south east this time?
@pppapin Seems to me that it's not undermining, but more of trying to push thsir brand. Whoever is more accurate, will have a better reputation. Nothing wrong with it in my opinion
@petenoordsy @NsfwWx seems like this model is trending towards a colder scenario after the models shifted north west today
@NsfwWx Correct if I'm wrong please What you were saying before is that basically the storm's energy has been consistently trending south east, allowing more cold air to move in then looking only at surface maps is no good cuz they dont have an accurate image of the impacts from cold air
@hvysnow @_NEweather does anyone take the navy model serious?
@MikeBWeather Heard differing opinions about the 12z GFS. Some say it looks better for the coast some say it looks worse. Any thoughts?
@MikeBWeather great graphics! really coming along well
@NsfwWx what does tpv mean?
@weatherwilly even if this storm ends up being most rain, this cold air rushing in at the end of the month could set up for a snowy february so I've heard
@weatherwilly when do you think we'll have a better handling of the system? tomorrow? thanks for the update by the way
@weatherwilly still believe an initial thump for i-95?
@NsfwWx Is the fv3 the new version of the GFS?
@DHenryTV @breakingweather @accuweather how much have they had so far?
@StephenUCS @capitalweather I've heard reports of up to 7 inches inside Washington DC. How much do you think the total will be at DCA airport?
@NsfwWx is that the one showing a coastal ice event?
@Eweather13 @FastFM meaning the chance is low?
@MikeBWeather at least we know the pattern is becoming more ripe for snow. Would it be too surpising if late january and february turned out to be pretty active?
@Eweather13 @crankywxguy how come? any implications on northeastern impacts?
@weatherwilly I'm sure we'll get a big one this year. The pattern is looking for conducive for snow later this month and February. If I remember correctly, it took a while in NYC to get big snow in 2013 winter. Then February came along
@AWxNYC Thank you for the answer. Always appreicated. At least it looks now like the pattern is more conducive for snow
@AWxNYC do you think this is a trend that will continue or just a one time run? also, what did the 18z gfs look like? thanks, as always
@michaeld021 I've heard that the euro came in lower? Any truth to that?
RT @ConservativePTZ: Taking a poll. 		Retweet if you REALLY want the WALL built.
@NJSnowFan So it creeps up north and gets pushed out to sea?
@severeweatherEU @lebanonweather where in lebanon did this occur?
@NsfwWx is the gfs of old still being used? or only this newer version now?
@NJSnowFan @HRApplianceman @AMSweather at some point, I'm sure the pattern will flip and at that point, something has to give, doesnt it?
@judah47 @dandoublec the only winter I can remember in the NYC area that produced barely any snow recently was 2012 winter. I remember frequent mild to warm temperatures and just about one or 2 snow events. As long as the current upper atmosphere doesnt resemble the one then, we could be fine
@dandoublec @judah47 nope, it was 2006.
@judah47 @dandoublec not necessarily. 2nd biggest snowstorm in NYC history that year
@weatherwilly What about any snow chances for NYC? Thanks
@AWxNYC @BigJoeBastardi your personal thoughts on this, allen?
@judah47 I assume this includes the northeast as well?
@NWSFortWorth thank you for all you do and all the information.
@NWSFortWorth I assume the ice threat starts wednesday night? Thanks
@NWSFortWorth if current trends remain the same, do you believe the western counties will be upgraded to a winter storm warning? thank you
@AMSweather thank you so much
@AMSweather where do you find this data? I'd like to find it for NYC as well
@antmasiello meaning the cold air wouldn't come down any further
@NJSnowFan at least it shows that the pattern is becoming ripe, right?

@TomNiziol will this storm become named? Thanks for all your weather information, Tom.
@judah47 which one are you leaning more towards?
@ScottPresler And it's an American territory, so that makes it more worth it to spend your money on
@MikeBWeather Merry Christmas. Thanks for all the nsight to weather you provide.

Any thoughts? And thanks for the inishgt, it's among the best out there!
@weatherwilly Anything in NYC?
@AMSweather so there'll be sunshine tomorrow?
@NWSAnchorage what town is that in the webcam? looks like a nice little village
@AMSweather I hope we can get out of this pattern soon. I've heard colder air will return by the end of this month. Any thoughts?
@BCunningham215 So now disagreeing with someone means that he is brainwashed?
@nynjpaweather you think we stay in this current pattern next month as well?
@NsfwWx Do you think this is the pattern we'll still be dealing with in January as well? Thanks for the information as always

@NWSWichita thank you
@NWSWichita what is the snow threshold for the kansas city area to have a winter storm warning issued? As always, thanks for the info, and have a great thanksgiving!
@NsfwWx Ah yes. How much did this storm in particular drop in your area
@NsfwWx it barely materialized into anything though here in NYC. The best one was definitely the one in late march. 14-15" in queens
@carolmswain I propose a special counsel should be created to investigate all of these "suspicious counties" to see exactly what went down midterm day.
@AMSweather Snowiest decade here in NYC as well
@MikeBWeather I've heard that some analogs similar to this year are 2009-2010. It could be a good year for snow people
@MikeBWeather what is your total right now? Mine is 4.8 inches
@NWSNewYorkNY @nynjpaweather @MikeBWeather @weatherwilly 		4.8 storm total here in Bayside, northern queens. Mixing with light rain now. Quite a way to start the season!
@AWxNYC @NWSNewYorkNY the snow continues to come down in bayside, queens. About 4.4 inches
@NWSNewYorkNY 		Exactly 4 inches of snow in Bayside queens as of 5:10 PM.
@_NEweather @MikeBWeather do you think it will be similar to the 2013-2014 winter. Thanks again for all your info
@antmasiello how much longer to go for this band of snow?
@antmasiello and that heavy band will be lifting into NYC? Thanks for your insight by the way

@NsfwWx reminds me of the 2012 october, when weactually hit 34 degrees one morning here in NYC
@RyanMaue Do you think they'll upgrade it to a category 5
@NsfwWx is that weaker than the previous run?
@NsfwWx Honestly, how did he even get to that conclusion? And to say it's weakening right now, it just doesn't make sense. If there was some evidence of that then maybe it would be slightly believeable, but there's no evidence of such
@ReedTimmerAccu @accuweather I doubt it will reach major hurricane strength. Too much wind shear in teh gulf and some dry air. Probably category 2 at maximum
@DrShepherd2013 @MikeBWeather hurricane debby 1961, ring a bell?

@AllieCiaccio @dominos @spann where is this located?
@NWSBlacksburg will evacuations be necessary?
@NWSBlacksburg is major flooding expected in danville due to this river rise?
@AMSweather I could definitely see some harvey-like pictures coming out of this area later this weekend and Monday, can't you
@EdValleeWx Expecting it to rise?
@N_CarolinaSunSh @mitchellvii What town is this
@hurricanetrack where is this located?
@hurricanetrack where did you find this?
@AMSweather this radar depiction would also show a great deal of storm surge in parts of SC like myrtle beach as well. Do you think the storm surge in NC will be higher than Ike's in Texas?
@EdValleeWx I honestly wouldn't be surprised if florence mantains category 4 strength at landfall
@TropicalTidbits if it drifts westward. does that lead to more rainfall, or would a drifting north scenario lead to higher rainfall totals.
@EdValleeWx could this decrease the flooding threat in the area?
@iCyclone @JulieWilcoxWX This might be a stupid question, and I already think the answer is yes.. but are you still as thrilled to chase cyclones now as you were when you started? Or does it feel sorta dull?
@iCyclone I'm pretty sure there is a Hilton Hotel in Morehead City in case it makes landfall around there. Solid building for the best footage. Cheap too, I heard
@NWSColumbia not what this area needs especially with the rain that willl be coming from Florence
@AMSweather so how come coastal areas of South Carolina are evacuating? due to the wind maybe?
@AWxNYC what's the cause of this coastal flooding in the area the past few days?
@NsfwWx you think it's up to something?
@AWxNYC @michaeld021 do those flight level winds translate down to the surface?
@v3ktorious @iCyclone agree with you 100%, cliff
@iCyclone @v3ktorious @iCyclone is easily the best storm chaser out there. Looking forward to the NC chase as always
@EdValleeWx hasn't it been extremely wet near the outer banks though?
@ExtremeStorms how strong will it be by the time it makes landfall in rota?
@rms5539 @TropicalTidbits from where? and how long does it usually take to get to the storm?
@TropicalTidbits @rms5539 so that means one will happen tomorrow afternoon, I assume?
@AWxNYC Does it take the storm out to sea
@AMSweather for any complex storm, they adjust the cone about 50 different times and then claim that they never go "run to run" adjusting things. Makes no sense
@NsfwWx how come the pressure seems so low for a storm that would clearly not be a hurricane at this point?
@AMSweather do you still think its possible that the storm curves out to sea with no landfall?
@NJSnowFan i assume by the time it moves over NJ, it would no longer be a hurricane?
@NJSnowFan are you leaning more of florence going OTS or moving inland somewhere alone the Mid Atlantic coast?
RT @AgustinAlvira: #SaturdayMorning Obama thought the internet would forget this video. He should of known better. https://t.co/sjWYpqty9n
@AMSweather No its fine, I knew what you meant, I was just adding my thoughts into the discussion. I just think that too many people identify as being part of one party instead of just wanting both sides to cooperate.
@AMSweather honestly, I think it's just the democratic politicians and media that lie. In general, democrat or republican, we all want the best for the country, we just have different ways of showing it. I dont think lying is necessarily a right or left thing
@AMSweather Do you think it would head up from the Carolinas towards the northeast like Irene did?
@Jackson_Dill @weatheroptics Has it ever happened in recent history
@Jackson_Dill @weatheroptics How is it still going so strong even though the environmental factors are completely against it
@iCyclone so does that mean it reapidly intensified before making landfall? thanks, and I'm looking forward to your videos
@iCyclone So this was a category 3 then?
@AWxNYC why exactly do hurricanes seem to really intensify overnight?
@AWxNYC @NHC_Atlantic @DaDaBuh @jonroccowx @raileyky @CristCacewx @NewThor @MassachusettsWx @TheWeatherMastr @tropicalupdate @BobbiStorm @KalTellefsenWX I heard that there might be some wind shear impeding it a bit in the future over where it is supposed to track?

@AWxNYC I was wondering if it was possible that these trends south are just a correction thing. It trended north yesterday, now south today, maybe its just correcting itself and it'll find middle ground. I remember the trends south for jan 2016 blizzard, then it corrected north again
@AWxNYC is there a reason why the more zonal pattern is showing up? does it have to do with the western ridge becoming flatter ahead of this system?
@AWxNYC @harrywx1999 I remember that. 6-12 inches were expected for NYC and a rapid shift South left us with nothing
@33andrain 		I just signed up for your weather forum, and for some reason, the confirmation email isnt being sent to my email. It happened earlier and I thought I messed up, but I tried it now and the same thing is occuring. Is there something I'm not doing?
@michaeld021 Definitely have more than 55 inches here in bayside queens
@AWxNYC @TWCChrisBruin I wish I still had the weather channel, it was the only good thing on television
@harrywx1999 @AWxNYC central park actually had 5.5. some areas had up to 6.5 inches. mainly 4-6 inches though so basically double what most predictions were
@NWSNewYorkNY @weatherwilly @MikeBWeather 		5.9 inch total in Bayside Queens. Snow is over now
@NWSNewYorkNY @MikeBWeather		About 5 inches in Bayside Queens so far. Still coming down good as of 8:45
@MikeBWeather @crankywxguy Some roads are even slightly covered in northern Queens
@michaeld021 thank you
@michaeld021 how can I find one for laguardia or jfk?
@michaeld021 what location is this supposed to be for?
@crankywxguy @joshtimlin its not really faking if thats what really falls, is it?
@MikeBWeather how is it even possible to be fluffy snow in early april?

@AMSweather @joshtimlin I've only experience thundersnow once, and it was in 2015, durng the late january storm in queens. About 13 inches of snow, and thundersnow at night
@AMSweather were they all digital?
@AMSweather just a quick question, what did weather models look like back then?
@McBeeWX I remember that small outbreak. An EF2 tornado touched down outside of Tulsa, destroying a mobile home park, and killing 2 people in it. Just goes to show how it only takes one to be really impactful
@alroker but can police be everywhere all the time. Police dont always know where and when there is trouble. Have you never taken matters into your own hands?
@MikeMasco @AWxNYC @weatherchannel twc will never get it together? or accuweather and weather nation?
@MikeBWeather Snowfall in NYC definitely higher than 10 inches. Multiple reports of up to 15
Falling*
@NWSNewYorkNY with light snow fllong overnight, that additional snow put Bayside at 14.2 inches  total
@NWSNewYorkNY after reviewing all measurements i just took and properly dividing them, it would actually be 13.8 inches in Bayside, Queens
@NWSNewYorkNY 13.7 inches of snow for me in Bayside. Will take last measurement in the morning
Inches*
@NWSNewYorkNY 		11 pm update. 11.5 imcges nearly to the dot in Bayside, Queens
@nwsnewyork   11.5 inch total in Bayside Queens.
Exactly 1.5 inches of snow in the last hour, bringing the total up to 11.5 inches in Bayside, Queens
@NWSNewYorkNY @MikeBWeather @AWxNYC 		9;57 update. Exactly 10 inches so far in Bayside, Queens. Snow coming down at a very good clip
@michaeld021 @MikeBWeather @NWSNewYorkNY I find it intereting that central park has only had 6.8 inches of snow. When will there be the next update?
@NWSNewYorkNY @AWxNYC @nynjpaweather 		8.3 inches now in bayside, queens. smaller, fluffier flakes, but coming down at good rate
@AWxNYC when will the next measurement come out from central park?
@AWxNYC I've heard that the heavy band of snowfall off the coast wont push through NYC
@NWSNewYorkNY @michaeld021 @AWxNYC @MikeBWeather 		7.8 inches here in Bayside, Queens. 1 inch higher than the previous update.
@NWSNewYorkNY @AWxNYC @nynjpaweather 		With an inch in the last 45 minutes, bayside, queens, (specifically bay terrace), elevation of 80 feet, has 6.8 inches of snow
@crankywxguy you can have that amount on top of dirt or grass or cold surfaces in your backyard, but the roads can be mainly wet
@_NEweather you think the sleet in NYC is going to change back over to snow?
@nynjpaweather its all sleet here in queens, do you think we shift back to snow soon?
@NWSNewYorkNY @nynjpaweather @AWxNYC 		Clearly above 6 inches here on Bayside, Queens. 6.3 inches average of 7 measurements https://t.co/yTtL25xCIH
@AMSweather nyc is doing pretty well actually. A bit over 5 inches here in Bayside, and some parts of brooklyn are reporting up to 5 inches as well. In general, there has been 3-6 so far in NYC. I've heard Long Island barely has anything
@MikeBWeather how much have you had there for the season? you're above average, right?
@weatherwilly last question... when do you think we'll know the answer?
@weatherwilly I've heard that it might set up just offshore instead. Which would give us some sinking air
@weatherwilly do you think a mesoscale band feature will set up over NYC this evening? is that what this signal is showing?
@NWSNewYorkNY @AWxNYC @_NEweather 		5.6 inches here in bayside, queens. Some parts of the front of the house had up to 6 inches, other parts had about 5-5.1. Average it and thats what you get. Snowing very hard now with large flakes
@NWSNewYorkNY @nynjpaweather @_NEweather 		5.1 inches in bayside, queens as of 11:55 A.M. It has now tapered to some light snow and sleet
@AWxNYC @_NEweather @NWSNewYorkNY 		As of 11:20, 4.7 inches of snow in bayside, queens. 0.8 in the last 45 minutes.
@AWxNYC yep, the snow isnt wet at all. fine, fluffy flakes blown by the wind in queens. you think this could help enhance totals?
@NWSNewYorkNY @nynjpaweather @weatherwilly 		10:35 update. Snow coming down good in bayside queens, with 3.9 inches on the ground. 0.8 of an inch in the past hour
@AMSweather I've seen some others on here change their amounts every time a model changes. Thats modelology, as they say, not meteorology
@nynjpaweather @NWSNewYorkNY @MikeBWeather @michaeld021 		3.1 inches now in Bayside, Queens, as of 10:05 A.M. 0.9 of an inch in the last 30 minutes.
@_NEweather that seems to be right over NYC. you think NYC will jackpot?
@NWSNewYorkNY @nynjpaweather @MikeBWeather @weatherwilly 		9:35 measurement in bayside, queens. 2.3 inches. Average of 6 measurements. Snow continues to come down heavily
@AMSweather it seems like the snow might actually continue nearly all night for queens and nyc
@NJWeather13 does this include NYC doing the best?
@_NEweather @NJWeather13 so you  think NYC is good for a big hit?
@NWSNewYorkNY @nynjpaweather @MikeBWeather 		Wet snow and large flakes coming down in bayside, queens. Believe it or now, the snow is actually sticking
@BobBob46988090 @michaeld021 Although it shows a lot of snow for nyc, if the heaviest bands do end up north of here, then I'm pretty sure we'd be in the subsidence zone, meaning a lot less snow
@michaeld021 Ive heard that the best banding show on this run is to the north of NYC, which would make NYC ripped off right?
@NsfwWx when was it released?
@michaeld021 i used to love watching the weather channel. and then 3 years ago, verizon fios took it away. I wonder if there is a way to watch it online somehow?
@michaeld021 how accurate is it? just a general question for most of the meso models out there. are they more accurate than the operationals in short range? or vice versa?
@AWxNYC @NsfwWx so you believe the city mixes for hours tomorrow afternoon?
@MikeBWeather Do you think NYC will be south of that sharp gradient?
@EdValleeWx How much does it show for nyc? Thanks for all your information by the way
@AWxNYC Would this include NYC?
@AWxNYC @MikeBWeather staten island and northeastern queens dont really have this urban heat island effect, certainly not as much as the surrounding boroughs
@_NEweather too dry?
@NsfwWx the sharp cutoff on the nam reminds of the cutoff from the january 2016 blizzard. Obviously not gonna be anything like that, but the cutoff situation seems very similar
@_NEweather what is a MECS potential?
@RealSullivanWx @WeatherInTheHud is there a link to this graphic?
@WeatherInTheHud thats about 30 inches in Bayside, Queens. Seems about right, but the storm from early december isnt factored in, which would add another 4-5 inches to NYC's total, which according to this, is 27-31+ inches
@NWSNewYorkNY @MikeBWeather @nynjpaweather 		Storm total in Bayside Queens is about 3.1 inches in the coldest surfaces in the backyard deck. It's now raining lightly
@AWxNYC @AccuRayno thank goodness. I always wondered why we seemed to get more snow than the rest of NYC
@AWxNYC @AccuRayno It's sticking fine in Bayside. Sticking to almost everything
@islivingston nope, the january 2016 blizzard is still my favorite of the decade. probably always will be, considering it was the worst storm in NYC history
@WeatherInTheHud looks like one of those bands may set up over NYC tomorrow?
@AWxNYC @NsfwWx how much do you think will fall in queens? will the temperatures be non-conducive for sticking?
@NsfwWx there is a wwa for us here in queens, for 2-4 inches of snow. Sound reasonable?
@michaeld021 honestly, this hasnt been a bad winter. NYC is slightly above average, as is most of the tri-state area. Some areas are well below average and some are right on the average mark. Not bad at all. A few storms, and a record cold snap.
@michaeld021 is it possible that this band would set up over queens as well?
@AMSweather @NWSBoston looks like someone was able to persuade a government agency to adopt their forecasting style. good looking map though, as always.
@_NEweather maybe if my math problems were like this in middle school, I would have been more interested in doing well
@NsfwWx what does this mean in normal english terms? thanks for your info as always
@NsfwWx About 35 in Bayside Queens
@NsfwWx NYC is above average anyway as far as snowfall goes
@matthewboder @nynjpaweather similar here in bayside. Exactly 6.0 inches, and light snow is starting again after a 90 minute dry slot
@weatherwilly cant believe this dry slot in Queens. We had 5-6 inches, and now, it just shut off. You think it'll start up again soon?
@MikeBWeather Dry slotted in Queens too, do you think this is the end?
@NWSNewYorkNY @MikeBWeather @nynjpaweather @AMSweather @weatherwilly 		Average of 5.5 inches of snow in Bayside, Queens. Wind is increasing and snow is starting to drift. Most measurements were in between 5 and 6 inches. That is 1.7 inches of snow in the last 35 minutes.
@MikeBWeather @NsfwWx @NWSNewYorkNY 		Photos don't do it justice. Very heavy snow. Some of the heaviest snow I've ever seen now https://t.co/w86RW1nja2
@NWSNewYorkNY @nynjpaweather @MikeBWeather @AMSweather @weatherwilly 		3.8 inches of snow in Bayside, Queens. Coming down very hard now. Probably 2 inches an hour or more now
@MikeBWeather @NWSNewYorkNY going to go out annd measure now in Queens
@AMSweather do you think NYC will see a total of 8-12 inches by the time its done?
@AccuRayno the 1/4 is visibility?
@MikeBWeather Heaviest I've ever seen was in that blizzard January 2016. 4 inch per hour snowfall rates that afternoon
@MikeBWeather Do you think the nam was too overdone though?
@nynjpaweather @weatherwilly @MikeBWeather @NWSNewYorkNY 		Parents heard thunder 10 minutes ago in Bayside, Queens.
@EthanBr18146122 @AccuRayno That's a snowfall rate of about 6 inches per hour
@MikeBWeather at least NYC is only an inch and a half below average so far
@NJWeather13 @weathergod1234 @AccuRayno @bpm_dcwx @MikeBWeather @michaeld021 @_NEweather @NEWeatherWx @AlexWeather_NE @nynjpaweather @weatherwilly @crankywxguy @EdValleeWx @AMSweather is the RAP a credible model?
@weathergod1234 @AccuRayno @bpm_dcwx @MikeBWeather @michaeld021 @_NEweather @NEWeatherWx @AlexWeather_NE @nynjpaweather @weatherwilly @crankywxguy @EdValleeWx @AMSweather @NJWeather13 are you sure the pink isnt sleet?
@_NEweather what is the significance of the 540 line?
@wxpatel @AntiMattersWX yep.
@wxpatel @AntiMattersWX they did do an early dismissal back in january of 2011, and that was due to a blizzard. I remember leaving school at about 1 p.m. that day. And school was closed the next day, 19 inches on the ground
@michaeld021 where can you find that model?
@michaeld021 @WeatherInTheHud so what about the HRR?
@WeatherInTheHud how far west was it?
@WeatherInTheHud when is it released?
@AWxNYC was it just released?
@NsfwWx Do you still think your map from last night applies?
@NsfwWx This includes NYC?
@MikeBWeather Do you think that is more plausible?
@NsfwWx @effyklitnick26 How come it shows rain for nyc?
@MikeBWeather Are there many models that show a warmer solution?
@AWxNYC a bit confusing, but thanks for the clarification
@AWxNYC i heard that the reason for this could be the double barrel low?
@AWxNYC worse in what way?
@michaeld021 I remember the storm in early january actually met blizzard criteria even though there was no blizzard warning issued
@michaeld021 do you think there is a chance for blizzard conditions in NYC?
@michaeld021 I didnt mean for that to sound like an insult, just a bit curious
@michaeld021 seems like you took the more agressive outlook, didnt you
@harrywx1999 @AWxNYC @_NEweather @SusanRLane @NsfwWx @WestchesterWX @MassachusettsWx @Empire_Weather @AntiMattersWX @TheWeatherMastr @MikeBWeather alright, thanks for the info
@AWxNYC @_NEweather @SusanRLane @NsfwWx @WestchesterWX @MassachusettsWx @harrywx1999 @Empire_Weather @AntiMattersWX @TheWeatherMastr @MikeBWeather do you think it has any chance of getting into NYC? That 12 plus zone?
@NsfwWx what time?
@nynjpaweather @wunderground @bhensonweather dont think they'll respond to you. you can present real facts, they cant
@jhomenuk it looks like it is setting up right over NYC, doesnt it?
@weatherwilly @AMSweather @weatherwilly do you think you will be updating your map?
@NsfwWx @JlukeJohn do you think it will continue to move east or move west?
@NsfwWx you wouldnt take this model run seriously, though, would you? it seems a bit overdone, no?
@AMSweather do you think blizzard conditions are possible in NYC?
@EdValleeWx @snewenglandwx @ericfisher @ryanhanrahan @jhomenuk I remember last year in queens, we had about 7-10 inches of snow and sleet, before briefly turning to rain, and then back to snow again. What is HVN-ISP?
@NsfwWx oh I see your last tweet about it.
@NsfwWx perhaps it is catching onto the dry slot, which is why there seems to be less in NYC than all the surrounding areas. just a guess though
@weatherwilly do you think NYC might see a decent amount of snow?
@NsfwWx do you belive this would lead to a mostly rain scenario for NYC? and thanks for the infor by the way
@EdValleeWx @ericfisher @Eweather13 do you believe this track would allow NYC to see at least a few inches of snow? if not something signficant?
@NsfwWx what is SEPERATE?
@NsfwWx meaning what exactly? thanks for the info and great updates by the way.
@NsfwWx would this include NYC?
@NsfwWx What is the NAVY model?
@NsfwWx I remember seeing numbers like that this far out before that storm in mid March last year, which was an I-95 huge bust
@JackRoth2023 @RyanMaue I just think that when "bomb" is used, people dont understand. If I were the average person who doesnt know much about weather, I wouldn't understand it either. I just think giving it a name can help people track and remember it more
@RyanMaue I dont understand how naming a winter storm can be hype, but calling it a "bomb cyclone" isnt hype. After all, I've seen the news talk about "Storm Emma" in Europe. Is that not hype?
@_NEweather what about us in NYC? all rain with a little snow mixed in now
@NsfwWx how come its all rain here in nyc?
@MikeBWeather Rain here in Queens. How come?
@ericfisher this would probably be showing snow in NYC at 2 P.M. as well. -2 celsius, even farther up in the atmosphere, should translate to snow
@weatheroptics and look at that snow in NYC, very interesting to say the least
@AMSweather @MikeBWeather yep, agreed
@AMSweather @MikeBWeather its unfortunate, but at least with models and other tools released to the public, some people can become more informed. Maybe its better this way, when you think about it
@AMSweather @MikeBWeather Just the fact that they are called "pros" is annoying. Some proffessionals, smh
@MikeBWeather @AMSweather I think they are doing it just to make us laugh. After all, after a long day of work, who doesnt need to laugh? In all seriousness, its pretty weird some of the "official forecasts" I've seen from this storm
@MikeBWeather @AMSweather this reminds me of the storm about 9 days after Sandy. We were forecast to have one inch of wet snow, but the heavier precip turned to snow very quickly, leading to 8 inches and near blizzard conditions
@AMSweather @MikeBWeather The NWS calls for less than half an inch, the weather channel calls for a few wet flakes, and local news is calling for "a wet burst of snow Friday night". Its like they want to hurt their credibility
@MikeBWeather @AMSweather and I'm certain this would have significant implications on the weather forecasts that say not a single flake for NYC, correct?
@antmasiello what does dprog/dt mean?
@weatherwilly would this model show snow for NYC?
@TropicalTidbits still the best weather model site out there. this will only make it better. keep it up, and all the forecasters will be using this site soon
@MikeBWeather Do you really believe there is a high enough chance of heavy snow down to the coast? Or it's just a shift in the models today that will be corrected later on?
@NWSAmarillo it was late february of 2013, right? 19 inches of snow in Amarillo
@LagoudakisManny @AMSweather I wonder if this situation evolves like depicted above, if it would increase the chances for snow in NYC
@nynjpaweather what did the models show?
@epawawx @StuOstro @crankywxguy @WXRISKCOM @EdValleeWx so the stronger and more south the storm is, and the heavier the precipitation, I-95 has a higher chance or snow?
@StuOstro @crankywxguy @WXRISKCOM @EdValleeWx @epawawx uh... what exactly is cb?
@NWSMissoula That's a snowfall rate of 4.5 inches per hour
@ebizzylizzy @GregAbbott_TX @GovInslee Even worse with governor Cuomo here in New York. Sometimes I think he'll tax us so much that there won't be anything left to tax
@weatherwilly would this include NYC? thanks ahead of time
@MikeBWeather oh nevermind, I see your previous tweet
@MikeBWeather do you think it will be cold enough to snow, however?
@mikenidoking98 @dabeard @MetLife not at all. if you go on their site, you'll even see pro background check and registration reform
@mikenidoking98 @dabeard @MetLife They don't stay silent, they advocate for tougher gun laws and background checks to help prevent crazy people from getting the gun
@AMSweather @crankywxguy agree 100%
@AMSweather and they think they are the best too. They call people who dont work for weather companies "amateurs." Amateurs or not, I've learned more about weather from people like you, @crankywxguy and others than the "proffessionals".
@AMSweather unfortunately its moer than just these 2. I bet the majority of government employees feel the same way and retweet similar things
@AMSweather @EricBlake12 @davidhogg111 @BMcNoldy is even worse. His timeline is filled with these bs propoganda articles calling Trump deranged and crazy. Its fine if they dont support Trump, not everyone will, but they should watch what propoganda they retweet. Its crazy, especially for gov employees
@dabeard @MetLife yeah, because the NRA killed those kids right?
@MikeBWeather thanks for all you do. I'm sure you'll keep us posted
@MikeBWeather do you believe this will be the only actie period in march? the early part, and then after that, it shuts off? thanks
RT @williamottens: @RepLynnJenkins The Lawrence Public Library is in the final four of a national competition for Best Public Library, and…
@TomNiziol how do you determine the population under winter storm watches? what programs do you use? thanks, you're a great follow
@RyanMaue poleward side of jet means what?
@AMSweather I suppose weather will do what it wants in the end anyway
@AMSweather do you think this blocking is too strong for any substantial snow?
@mikebettes @weatherchannel more than 2 million people are under winter storm warnings in Portland, OR and Vancouver, WA area. Doesnt that mean you're supposed to name it?
@bpm_dcwx that was the best snowstorm I ever experienced in my whole life. A whopping 2-3 feet in NYC. Thought I would never see it
@Trolling3d @GBTRU @Breaking911 this could have been prevented if the law abiding citizens who worked at the store had a gun. But considering how hard it is to carry a gun in Massachussetts, its unfortunately an unlikely outcome for the innocent people
@AMSweather because you're not "official" enough, and you're just an amteur to them. Amateur or not, your forecasts are more accurate than theirs plenty of the time
@NWSNewYorkNY @weatherwilly @MikeBWeather @AMSweather 	With  this latest snow event on Saturday, it brings the season snowfall total to around 36-37 inches in Bayside. Likewise reports from nearby Whitestone and Little Neck. Seems like we have been in the jackpot area this winter
@crankywxguy well, when forecasting the inches of snow, they dont mention the snow impact. Technically, you can have 5 inches of snow with little impact, and 2 inches with big impact. They're just measuring what fell from the sky, not what the impact was
@SteveTSRA @Climatologist49 Such as the Calif. couple that chained their children up or the couple in Ohio that beat their child to death. Not to go on a rant, but if you want to say he is a "bad person" compared to politicians, thats one thing, but I'd say legit criminals and killers are way worse
@SteveTSRA @Climatologist49 I think most people realize that killers are worse than the president. Although I support him, I see what people mean when they list of criticisms, I understand it, but I think even people that really dislike him can see that killers and criminals are worse
@SteveTSRA @Climatologist49 3 mass shootngs*
@SteveTSRA @Climatologist49 Clearly you havent been paying attention to the news lately. They're have been  mass shootings and 2 terrorist attacks/attempted attacks since October. I'd say those 5 people are the worst in the country
@NWSNewYorkNY @MikeBWeather @weatherwilly	 5.7 inches of snow as final total in Queens
@NWSNewYorkNY @MikeBWeather @weatherwilly	11:04 measurement of nearly exactly 5 inches in Bayside. Maybe just a hair under. That's a quarter inch in about 35 minutes
@nynjpaweather Overperformed in Bayside, ny. About 4.5-5 inches with a little bit more to come
@NWSNewYorkNY @MikeBWeather @nynjpaweather 		25 minutes later, nearly exactly 0.25 of an inch more. 4.75 inches now in Bayside, Queens. That means rates are still near an inch an hour
@NWSNewYorkNY @MikeBWeather 		10:20 measurement in Bayside, Queens. Right on the 4.5 inch line. Big flakes continue to come down. Compaction is definitely startting to occur though
@MikeBWeather i hope it brings a good band of snow, and doesnt disipate before it reaches NYC (it does plenty of times)
@MikeBWeather what is causing this increase in precipitation on the back end of the storm?
@NWSNewYorkNY @nynjpaweather @weatherwilly 		4.0 inches now on the coldest metal surfaces in Bayside, Queens. Still coming down at about 1 inch an hour
@MikeBWeather @crankywxguy all snow here in Bayside, sitting at about 32 degrees. Latest measurement at 9:44 was just on the 4.0 inch line on the coldest metal surfaces
@MikeBWeather @mike61400 @nynjpaweather i honestly dont even know how manhattan had 27.5 inches from that blizzard back in january 2016. It doesnt seem like any snow even sticks in manhattan. Not an accurate representation of nyc at all snowfall wise
@nwsnewyork @MikeBWeather   	 0.7 inches in the last 35 minutes in Bayside. Now up to around 3.7 inches.
@MikeBWeather @NWSNewYorkNY @weatherwilly @nynjpaweather yep, shows light to moderate snowfall in queens, while the snowfall rates are close to about 1 inch per hour
@NWSNewYorkNY @weatherwilly @MikeBWeather @nynjpaweather 		I believe the radar is making snow seem lighter than it really is. The radar shows moderate snowfall in parts of northern and central New Jersey, where reports show that it is just dumping over there.
@NWSNewYorkNY @MikeBWeather @weatherwilly @nynjpaweather 		Exactly 3.0 inches in Bayside, Queens, on the coldest surfaces of my backyard deck. Dumping snow
@KalTellefsenWX @nynjpaweather @NWSNewYorkNY what exactly is a whiteboard? just curious
@weatherwilly just one more question and then I'm done, do you think that band will be this heavy when it reaches queens?
@weatherwilly do you believe this will be heading over to NYC?
@EdValleeWx it shows 4-6 inches for most of NYC, with the exception of the Bronx, where it shows 6-8 inches. We shall see. It'll be interesting, thats for sure. About 1 inch on the GFS, and up to 6 for the Euro and NAM
@AMSweather Any chance this solution is too warm or too cold?
@MikeBWeather What about NYC? Do we have a higher chance of snow than long island?
@AMSweather Would it be too warm to snow in NYC at that time of night?
@NWSEastern @NWSRaleigh only need 5-6 inches more here in NYC, and then we reach our season average
@MikeBWeather @AMSweather @Eweather13 34 inches* not 24
@MikeBWeather @AMSweather @Eweather13 for me, the all time best snowstorm was the January 23, 2016, one. up to 24 inches in queens
@AMSweather was a great storm for NYC too. up to 15 inches in queens and huge drifts, very windy, and one of my favorite storms to track
@NWSNewYorkNY Sleet lasted after the snow and ice ended, bringing this storm's wintry precipitation total up to 1.1 inches, slushy mess out here in Bayside
@NWSNewYorkNY 0.8 inch storm total of snow. Little bit of ice as well but now all rain. Bayside Queens
@nynjpaweather @crankywxguy if that occurs, do you think it would be somewhat unexpected until it happens or it will be predicted in advance?
@AMSweather is this a supermarket or..?
@MikeBWeather This includes Queens?
@weatheroptics @LaurenceTobias1 Do you expect any accumulation? Thanks
@NWSNewYorkNY @AMSweather		with yesterdays 2.2 inches of snow, bayside, queens, has seen about 30 inches, or just a little under that, since december 9.

@capeislsweather one of the only good bands out there is Dawes. They can actually sing
@SheldonBeatty @mlynnw777 @BreitbartNews how so? when do republicans knock black males? and before you bring up trump "slamming" black people, he does that to anyone who says anything "bad" to him
@AMSweather thank you
@AMSweather I meant GFS plume
@AMSweather where can I find the sref plume online for nyc? thank you
@AMSweather what about nyc? probably less than an inch, correct?
@AMSweather You think it'll track that close and be that strong?
@RepCurbelo especially dreamers, not especially americans. yeah, that'll go well for you in november. americans before illegals, all you congressman should remember that
@TaylorBold @RUthlessJ007 @Breaking911 disgusting*
@TaylorBold @RUthlessJ007 @Breaking911 Las Vegas shooting was done buy a white guy. And I'm white too. So would it be fair if I said that was racist? No, it wouldnt, because most mass shooters are white and its dusgusting. Just how the shootings in Chicago are done predominately by black people
@RUthlessJ007 @Breaking911 how is it racist? because blacks are doing most, if not all, of the shootings? facts arent racist
@EvanWx626 @AMSweather that storm produced 3 inch an hour snowfall rates when I was going to school that morning. Barely anyone in school. School would've definitely been closed if those intense snow rates were forecast
@EvanWx626 @AMSweather for NYC there was also the late january 2014 one, where 10-12 was predicted. Had just about that. But few storms are exactly on point
@EvanWx626 @AMSweather I think the only snowstorm I have been through that followed the forecast exactly was the blizzard in February 2013 for NYC.
@EvanWx626 @AMSweather that bust was the biggest one I think I ever went through. That one and the one from March last year. One in march was forecast to dump 12-18 inches. ended up getting 8 inhces of snow/sleet
@AMSweather @EvanWx626 same thing with that storm in NYC. Biggest storm on record. I loved measuring that 32 inches

@NWSNewYorkNY @AMSweather Bayside, Queens. Near Bayside high school
@NWSNewYorkNY @AMSweather 		Most grassy surfaces only have a coating, but the top of the school building has almost an inch. Snow is done, coldest surfaces have 0.8 of an inch
@AMSweather does this only include New England? Or would the chance of plowable snow be present in queens as well? Thanks
@ScottPresler I hope we can do it again next time in 2020. I've seen a lot of talk about that Blue Wave, and to be honest, Roy Moore losing might just be an example. We really need to get out the vote for conservatives this year
@JuanitaPuce @rhelwig7 @realDonaldTrump seriously? damn it, I was hoping for the bot status
@JuanitaPuce @rhelwig7 @realDonaldTrump funny how anything pro trump has to be a bot. And I bet all the money I have that you will accuse me of being a bot too
@keithboykin @IRAASColumbiaU maybe if blacks didnt do the msot crime, then they wouldnt be in jails
@AMSweather light*
@AMSweather ight freezing rain in queens right now. just below the freezing line.
@Dan55966248 @dualitypeace @SkiPow7 @AMSweather not saying that storm will happen. But sometimes you have to look beyond what you see on the model maps and look into the atmosphere more. I think thats what @AMSweather is getting at. Look into what he says before you knock him about something you know nothing about
@RyanBretonWX All that climate change.

@AynRandPaulRyan yeah thats how it's done. dont let the other side say a word and then whine and complain when they call you fake news for only promoting one side
@Dan55966248 @SkiPow7 @AMSweather The NWS isn't even correct half the time. They either have temperatures too high or too low and the same thing with snowfall
@AMSweather @RobertMDahlia I remember the last time NYC had a slow mover, it was January 2016. 25 hours of snow, and up to 34 inches. That was a wild blizzard.
@viewfrommyoffic so adding people of color would make them more in touch? as if white people never have to go through any struggles in life. And republicans are the racist ones? Riight
@weatherwilly same here in queens. I measured about 18 in bayside. Relatives in douglaston, little neck, and whitestone all measured about 16 inches of snow, if not higher. And @NWSNewYorkNY rejected all our snow totals and said the highest for Queens was bout 14 inches. Def more than that
RT @stormintercept2: A tweet a share or a donation even if just $5 dollars gets this trending. #landynStrong https://t.co/N1HiqtQfwb
@opxtrader @AMSweather actually got more than that here in queens. And central park had the lowest amount of about 10 inches. Some areas in queens got 16+
@NorthEast_Wx I can say one thing, and that is that I didnt expect so much snow for Queens. You did a good job forecasting overall though. That heavy mesoscale band just dumped snow on me for hours. Locations nearby also had the 16+ amount
@nymetrowx @NorthEast_Wx 		With this storm, Bayside has seen 27.8 inches of snow since December 9, 2017
@NWSNewYorkNY @nymetrowx 		With 18.1 inches of snow in 15 hours, that is an average of at least 1.2 inches of snow per hour today. Reporting from Bayside
@AMSweather Better submit to @NWSBoston 	Even though, half the time, the NWS doesn't consider snow totals from general public
@nynjpaweather @weatherwilly @AMSweather @NWSNewYorkNY 		18.1 inches total. Snow is done now. Drifts almost burying cars. I'll definitely remember this storm. More than double the forecast amount
@nynjpaweather @weatherwilly @AMSweather @NWSNewYorkNY 		Betwen 12 P.M. and 1 P.M. the snowfall rate was about 2 inches an hour (give or take)		That mesoscale band produced 10.2 inches of snow over a 4 hour (9 AM. - 1 P.M.) period. An average rate of 2.55 inches per hour.
@nynjpaweather @weatherwilly @AMSweather @NWSNewYorkNY 		Between 9 A.M. and 10 A.M, the snowfall rate was 2.2 inches per hour	Between 10 A.M. and 11 A.M., the snowfall rate was 3 inches per hour (just about)	Betwen 11 A.M. and 12 P.M., the snowfall rate was 3 inches per hour ...
@_NEweather @JSHurricaneNews thats what it looked like in queens for about 3 hours today.
@JustinNarvik11 @NEweatherHQ you got the same snow band that helped produce the near 18 inches in bayside, ny https://t.co/nFeL7ityVd
@NWSNewYorkNY @weatherwilly @nynjpaweather  17.9 inches before the final band moves in. Picture is taken in location protected by wind in a closed off section in back yard. (mouse or some little critter tracks also in picture) Confirms my measurement from front yard. Bayside, NY https://t.co/tTmZeTNTDE
@nynjpaweather @NWSNewYorkNY @weatherwilly 		Another 0.4-0.6 inches over the last 50 minutes. That brings the storm total to almost 18 inches in the front of my house. I'll measure later in the backyard (concentrated, wind prtected area) just to make sure. I'll post a pic of it
@LaurenceTobias1 @_NEweather Bayside in Queens was crushed. 3 inch per hour snowfall rates for hours in the morning. Most measurements around here are more than 15-16 inches.
@AFineBlogger @nynjpaweather actually another band will be coming through in a little while from New Jersey. expect another 0.5-1 inch most likely
@nynjpaweather @weatherwilly @NWSNewYorkNY 		Just about 17 inches of snow here in Bayside. Still coming down, but lightern than before. A bit windy as well. At least 0.5 inch more since my last measurement over 50 minutes ago
@weatherwilly is that a deformation band in north central jersey? if so, will it move into NYC?
@davidoysher @nickmcelroy2 @nynjpaweather do you know if the precipitation is moving east northeast, or just east?
@nickmcelroy2 @nynjpaweather will it head up to NYC?
@AWxNYC @_NEweather @NsfwWx remember that incorrect total for the blizard of january 2016 at central park that was revissed up 4 months later. These "official" weather sites always have problems
@AWxNYC @_NEweather @NsfwWx agreed. I have well over a foot in bayside. Something isnt adding up in central park and the airports. They should have had 9-11 inches by 1 P.M. and even more now
@NWSNewYorkNY @nynjpaweather @weatherwilly 	55 minutes later, nearly another inch of snow. Nearly 16.5 inches in Bayside. Took multiple memasurements to diffuse inaccurate snow totals. Drifts 2-3 feet. Still snowing strong here. When do you think it will let up?
@NWSNewYorkNY @nynjpaweather @weatherwilly 		nearly 15.5 inches as of 1:45 in bayside, ny. Heavy snow and wind continues		That heavy snow band has been sitting over us for hours
@EdValleeWx nearly 15.5 inches as of 1:45 in bayside, ny, near long island
@NWSNewYorkNY @nynjpaweather @AMSweather @weatherwilly 		Storm total for 1 p.m.: Just about 14 inches. 2 inches in the last hour. Very windy at times and heavy snow continues
@NEweatherHQ I am here in Bayside, Queens, NY. Whiteout conditions for about one hour. Snowfall rates of 3 inches in the alst hour. About a foot of snow so far
@BigJoeBastardi its worse. i went outside to measure and I almost fell. So windy and snowy its almost impossible to believe
@NWSNewYorkNY @nynjpaweather @weatherwilly 		12.0 inches as of just before noon. Thats the best average of all measurements. Lots of drifting and blowing. 3 inches of snow in the last hour
@weatherwilly @NWSNewYorkNY 	Camera doesn't do it justice but there is a lot of snow and wind right now. Total whiteout https://t.co/FOZdAUc6fc
@nishmanb @_NEweather Not for my area. NYC during the 2015 one had barely anything. 10 inches and a bit of wind. the 2016 one produced a lot more snow. so did boxing day. NYC was skunked during the 2015 one
@NWSNewYorkNY @weatherwilly @nynjpaweather 		9.0 inches in Bayside, Queens. 2.2 inches in the past hour
@_NEweather @nishmanb that January 2016 one was much worse than the Boxing Day Blizzard. up to 34 inches in Queens. Some roads werent plowed for 12 hours
@_NEweather Same, even more intense than the February 2016 one. That left me with about 12 inches
@_NEweather its been a straight whiteout the past 30 minutes on the queens/Long Island border
@NsfwWx @EthanLaigle @_NEweather how much more snow do you think queens, ny will pick up? thanks, and one of the best forecasters out there especially with this storm
@TheWeatherMastr @nynjpaweather @NsfwWx @NWSNewYorkNY Only other time I can remember snowfall rates like this in Bayside, Queens is during the January 2016 blizzard. Absolute whiteout.
@nynjpaweather @NWSNewYorkNY @weatherwilly 	New measurement of 6.9 inches in Bayside. Raidly accumulating, very strong wind, visbility near 0 at times. 3.1 inches of snow in the last 2 hours
@nynjpaweather @weatherwilly @NWSNewYorkNY 		5.6 inches of snow now in Bayside, Queens. Winds gusting to 40 mph, and visibility less than one block. Thats 1.7 inches of snow in 90 minutes
@NWSNewYorkNY @nynjpaweather @weatherwilly 		Definitely a blizzard here in Queens. Very strong winds, visibility less than one block
@nynjpaweather @weatherwilly @NWSNewYorkNY 		Took more measurements. 4.5 inches in Bayside, Queens, so far. Wind is whipping. Handheld anemometer has measured a wind gust to 39 mph. That's 0.7 inches of snow in the last 40 minutes
@NWSNewYorkNY @weatherwilly @nynjpaweather 		Very hard to mmeasure the snow, a lot of blowing and drifting. I took 11 measurements and the most accurate estimate is about 3.8 inches in Bayside, Queens, so far. Coming down heavy and very windy
@NWSNewYorkNY @nynjpaweather @nymetrowx  Snow coming down good in Bayside. Wind clearly picking up. Light and powdery snow. No one on the roads
@_NEweather meaning?
@weatheroptics that would lead to much stronger winds over the coasts than usual with these storms, right?
@NWSNewYorkNY is it possible that blizzard warnings will be extended to NYC? thank you
@NorthEast_Wx You dont think blizzard conditions will be much of an issue for NYC, right? Too far west for the queens area?
@NorthEast_Wx would queens, since it is closest to long island, have 6-10 inches, or the 4-8 amount? thanks, and great map
@nickmcelroy2 @EdToron And I assume this storm would produce ratios higher than 10:1?
@nynjpaweather Is it possible that those intense bands reach NYC?
@crankywxguy Forming earlier means it is more west, right?
@AMSweather Would that include NYC
@MassachusettsWx how come you chose this model? I've heard the NAM always overdoes things like these systems
@weatherwilly isnt it better to look at the overall trend of the model instead of the QPF output? just my opinion
@NEweatherHQ what would ridging over the north atlantic lead to in this case?
@weatherwilly I'm loving these temperatures. Would these make the snow ratios on Thursday high?
@amon8003 @crankywxguy ah, I see it now. thank you
@crankywxguy earlier means further west or east? thanks, you have information rarely seen here on twitter
@AMSweather and the blue colors represent sinking air? so a dry slot so to speak?
@AMSweather seems like it went a bit west to me
@NorthEast_Wx what could that consensus might be? it seems like they're split between east and west. I've heard it makes a big difference
@crankywxguy did the NWS get rid of ice storm warnings as well?
@crankywxguy any thoughts on the models moving east this run?
@AMSweather Is there a chance with the shifts west that NYC sees higher than 8
@AMSweather Do you think blizzard conditions will reach NYC?
@RyanGriffinWX @TheWeatherMastr Which means what exactly
@kevinsweather @BtownBombers18 @crankywxguy @bpm_dcwx @crankywxguy said that the low is developing early and it'll be west. so how does that make it go out to sea?
@stormchaserjs when does that come out?
@stormchaserjs @ericfisher @MJVentrice it always seems so bullish to me
@weatherwilly @JayB7897 @lakewood732 @thomasjcimino @YouTube do you think queens will get  adecent amount from this system? thanks
@AMSweather is this model usually accurate?
@LagoudakisManny @AMSweather The other two, in my opinion, who never hype things, are @crankywxguy and @nynjpaweather
@DarlingEbony @TertleKatie so only whites can be racist?
@BravenakBlog media hates hillary? I dont know what media you're watching. Besides fox, they seem to love her
@NorthEast_Wx you think that could happen?
@weatherwilly it seems like queens is right on the line of possible snow and a good storm, right?
@JakKlein @nynjpaweather I heard that with this cold air, the ratios in the current position would be at least 20:1
@AMSweather Thanks for the insight
@AMSweather Have the models been trending more east today?
@NWSJacksonMS knew it. I called the last one
@nynjpaweather what would the snow ratios be? thanks in advance
@crankywxguy is NYC technically part of Mid Atlantic or New England? thanks, its a question I've had for years
@weatherwilly when does the new euro come out?
RT @JordanPayneWX: Cold without snow stinks. Cold without snow stinks. Cold without snow stinks. Cold without snow stinks. Cold without sno…
@crankywxguy what about the 50/50 benchmark?
@AMSweather I remember it had no impact on NYC whatsoever. Makes me think this storm could be similar
@AMSweather Did the model move east overnight?
@NorthEast_Wx The 18z run or the 0z run?
@LagoudakisManny @crankywxguy as in the storm will track far to the east of the coast, or the track depicted above is too far to the east?
@AMSweather @crankywxguy @KubaStan11 what's H5?
@NWSNewYorkNY Final storm total of 1.3 inches in Bayside. Just ended 10 minutes ago. 9.7 inches this month
@AMSweather people cant even say it is ok to drive in the snow without being lectured. People have places to go, just make sure to take it slow.
@mcadehaven @nynjpaweather @epawawx I hope so. Every season has had above average snowfall since 2013 for us here
@mcadehaven @nynjpaweather @epawawx 1.2 inches in bayside, queens. that means we are up to 9.6 this season, so far
@NWSNewYorkNY 1.1 inches of snow so far in Bayside. Lightly coming down now
@nynjpaweather so the band wont hand north, it'll just move east in a few hours
@Tkoko22 @nynjpaweather @NJSnowFan @WxmanFranz @StormForce_1 @Vortmax29 @antmasiello will that work its way up to NYC?
RT @NYPDnews: 480 new NYC protectors taking their oath before they graduate the NYPD Police Academy. RETWEET to say thank you and congrats!…
@NWSNewYorkNY Dusting in Bayside. Snow has been falling for an hour now
@NWSJacksonMS I would put the 5th as the surprise snow storm a few weeks ago. way more than forecast
@antmasiello That was a crazy winter. Only 7 inches in NYC. And weeks of 50-60 degrees and higher
@antmasiello that was the esceptionally warm and snowless winter, right?
@NJSnowFan @nynjpaweather makes me think tomorrow nights low temperatures will be lower than what the forecast calls for
@TomNiziol looks like dunkirk is going to get the most this time around
@NWSMarquette I actually went onto accuweather and the weather channel and their radars didnt pick anything up either
@NWSMarquette weird, because the radar isnt picking anything up over Houghton County
@joshuabutcher83 thank you very much
@AMSweather So the totals could be double of what the SREF is showing, right? Give or take
@AMSweather Wouldnt the ratios during the storm be more around 20:1?
@joshuabutcher83 @NorthEast_Wx @crankywxguy NYC if you can, please
@NorthEast_Wx @crankywxguy do you have an image of it? thanks
@crankywxguy 15z is what time?
@nynjpaweather Would that include NYC?
@woodruffbets Oh no. This is really bad. I cant think of anything else that is as bad as this. What a bombshell report
@splillo when it comes to many weather events, he is right all the time though. Harvey, sandy, winter storms, etc.

@tonyrizzo1216 @AMSweather platform*
@tonyrizzo1216 @AMSweather giving your opinion isnt pushing an agenda. its when you have a large latform and try to manipulate what people think-that's pushing an agenda. big difference
@famoros1 @AMSweather I know. As a millennial, it's annoying to see my generation fuss about everything. NYC has to be the "triggered" capital of America
@ReedTimmerAccu @breakingweather do you ever stop chasing? love your videos by the way
@AMSweather would that 3-6 amount include Queens, NY, and NYC, or only long island. Great map as usual by the way
@BuzzFeedLGBT it might be because its a sickness to be Lesbian, gay, or whatever else they call them. no need to expose little kids to that
@crankywxguy where do you find these graphics? thanks
@ScottPresler Not many conservatives left here in NYC. Trying to vote Schumer out last election was  disaster
@ScottPresler I hope its working. If Trump loses the house or the Senate, we are screwed. I wish I could vote Gillibrand out next year
@AMSweather any idea on the amounts? thanks
@AMSweather this would include queens, new york, right?
@damonwon @TotalyNotHitler @HCountermine @Breaking911 I think it's the children in certain schools that make it so that the school doesn't want to spend the money on them because they don't care to be there. I've been to NYC schools in white neighborhoods during bussing, not pretty
@TotalyNotHitler @damonwon @HCountermine @Breaking911 Also what you learn in the home from your parents has an impact on your life. Bad parents have a bad influence on kids
@TotalyNotHitler @damonwon @HCountermine @Breaking911 Schools aren't worse now and with all the diversity in the workplace, there's no excuse not to get an education. The more you learn, the more you earn
@EmmettWalsh11 @AmyCA0214 @ABC I'm trying to say that is seems a bit inconclusive to me
@pauliniguez @capitalweather What I was trying to say is that the reason why they seem so high is because the last 7 years of temperatures haven't been factored in yet. Once put in, those temperatures wont seem as "abnormal" because they're not
@damonwon @TotalyNotHitler @Breaking911 subjugated to what? bussing so they could go to a better school? no one forces them to do what they do.
@capitalweather Seems to me that averages are made off of each year's temperatures, which means these "warmer than normal" temperatures should be factored in. But they arent factored in, leading to temperatures to seem much warmer than normal
@AmyCA0214 @ABC how is ted cruz my hero? although you may not know this, I went against him in the republican party in hopes for a different candidate. and you cherry picked erie's snowfall record while ignoring records that came decades ago, but there was no mention of climate change then
@AmyCA0214 @ABC Then I guess anything outside of "average" is "climate change", but only if the date is 2000 and later, not before. Interesting
@AMSweather I think for NYC, the most shocking season was 95-96, when 78 inches of snow fell. Just as shocking was 73-74 winter, when only 2 inches fell
@AmyCA0214 @ABC so its climate change when there is too much snow, and climate change when there is too little snow, right? was it climate change in 1974-1975 in nyc, when there was only 2.8 inches of snow? or was it climate change when almost 80 inches fell in '96?
@AMSweather hoping that this applies to NYC
@NWSCLE 65.1 inches is the total since 7 P.M. Christmas eve, right?
@AMSweather I dont know how to read weather models that well, but i heard that they were trending farther south and east.
@RyanMaue havent weather extremes always been happening? so why do we need to blame it on "global warming" or "climate change" now, when we never blamed it on anything except for "its weather" before?
@isodrosotherm @TropicalTidbits there's no better weather modeling website than @TropicalTidbits 		best of the best
@nynjpaweather we got 23 inches of snow in NYC. hours of blizzard conditions
@AMSweather seems to me like the threat of snow is being pushed back towards sunday and monday
@spann Is it just me or has the South been seeing more snow events the last few years than normal during the winter?
@RVAwonk if what he said about the Hatians is true, then that isnt fair for him to say at all. But the part about Nigerians? There's a lot of truth to it
@NWSCaribou will you be issuing any winter storm watches? thanks
@StormFrontWX are you surprised there wasnt an ice storm warning issued for this one
@AynRandPaulRyan @RepMaryFranson She's correct though. The Democrats always say that republicans deny science, but science tells us that a guy is a guy and a girl is a girl. If you're confused, then check your pants
@AMSweather @VP I would love to see him run in 2024
@ericfisher and 48 degrees in queens. crazy
@CristCacewx @AMSweather whats the difference between ice accretion and accumulation?
@weatherwilly do you think any of it would accumulate in nyc?
@AMSweather Would this bring snow to nyc
@AMSweather Shows how a small difference in track makes a large difference in storm impact
@ScottPresler This is fine and all, but my middle class family will be screwed by this. Living in Queens, NY, we wont be able to deduct our high property taxes anymore.
@NWSFairbanks do you have any reported amounts of snow totals yet? thanks
@AMSweather @NorthEast_Wx @jonroccowx it was Hurricane Irene for me
@AMSweather 2nd worst snowstorm in my book for NYC. About 24 inches in Queens. The worst was January 2016. 32 inches in Queens. Crazy stuff
@nymetrowx @whitewolf2226 Best shot I could get. Definitely starting to melt a bit though https://t.co/rkkVKHIxmZ
@nymetrowx @whitewolf2226 I'll try to do one when I get home. Some of it melted on the deck already.
@nymetrowx 2.3 in bayside, queens
@AMSweather @based_stefanos 2.1 inches I'm Bayside Queens NY. 8.2 inches since Saturday
@weatherwilly Almost 2 inches so far in Bayside,Queens. Still snowing. Surprised there is such a difference between NJ and queens
@weatherwilly meaning? like a year full of surprises?
@LagoudakisManny @ReaLasitCanBe @miguel99nyc @nynjpaweather agreed. that always confuses me. I'd also like to know if this would include nyc
@TinaOlley @StormHour @ReedTimmerAccu What town is this?
@DCrounder @NWSBUFFALO its still snowing, I presume?
@KeithCarson I remember there were about 20 inches in lewiston, if I remember correctly. Meanwhile, similar to this storm, there was only rain in NYC.
@KeithCarson kind of reminds you of the storm around december 27/28 last year, right?
@AMSweather i believe it was about 1 or 2 days after christmas
@AMSweather I believe the last system that set up similar to this one was in late december 2016. Correct? Or was that different?
@DCrounder @NWSBUFFALO how much snow so far there? thanks
@JackSillin @RyanBretonWX what is PWM?
@MarcusForMahwah @nynjpaweather how much snow so far?
@AMSweather over 3 inches by now here in bayside
@AMSweather thanks!
@AMSweather any idea when the snow might end for nyc? thanks
@nynjpaweather what about nyc? overperform or right on track?
@AMSweather same thing with the farmers almanac. and the farmers almanac has always been able to point out the big storms. almost all the time. how do they do it?
@weatherwilly bayside, queens. looks like we'll be on the northern edge
@nynjpaweather actualy quite a lull in the snow here in queens. but i see that heavier band moving from jersey to nyc soon. darker clouds to the west
@W_Official_ @JoshHendershott @ESPNFC what does this have to do with the president?
@nynjpaweather will any mesoscale banding form over nyc? thanks, and you're a great follow!

@HousingHumanRt @CrenshawSubway @LACANetwork @CalOrganize @AIDSHealthcare @BLMLA @DSA_LosAngeles @CHIRLA @BlackWkrCenter @HousingLB @YouthJusticeLA you do realize that gentrification increases property value so blacks in those neighborhoods can sell the homes for a much higher price. no gentrification= very low property levels.

@JamieOGrady I think you should be thankful that you are living in this country instead of complaining about the president. No matter who the President is, Americans can always count on security and rights in this country. Obama or not

@jenn_clark what if those white men had a better platform?
@Christo52317208 @CLOSErikers @NYCMayor @VOCALNewYork @JustLeadersUSA @BilldeBlasio @TweetBenMax @DarrenMack718 @glennEmartin @OcheretinaA @valriecf why should rikers be closed? how about not do the crime, and you wont do the time
@Scotttaylorva Vote for Ed Gillespie
@H3i9htM3N @Anaridis And how would that work in a country where there have been so many guns for centuries
@Anaridis Maybe because this guy got the gun when he wasn't supposed to. So obviously gun control didnt work
@Streaksfriend @Franklin_Graham and though we may disagree, at least we kept it civilized
@Streaksfriend @Franklin_Graham I dont think my faith should be as much of a discussion as a mass muderer, but you know what, have a nice day
@Streaksfriend @Franklin_Graham Trump isnt the only christian, and christians dont always follow him. he doesnt define christianity, no one does
@Streaksfriend @Franklin_Graham Who said I dont care about non believers? How did you even make that conclusion?
@Streaksfriend @Franklin_Graham I can tell people I'm a christian if I am one, which I am
@Streaksfriend @Franklin_Graham there has to be some red flags. do more background checks, gun registrations, etc. other than that, not much you can do
@Streaksfriend @Franklin_Graham I'm not trying to say you should be a christian, I am trying to have a discussion on what to do for the future regarding such things
@Streaksfriend @Franklin_Graham if the terrorist is white, then they deserve torture too. not based on race, based on what you know
@Streaksfriend @Franklin_Graham My opinion on stopping what happened today is to not allow crazies to get their hands on guns. probably impossible but...
@Streaksfriend @Franklin_Graham as if terrorists dont deserve torture? and how else do we get information from them?
@Streaksfriend @Franklin_Graham however you perceive it, I engaged in this conversation to discuss how/if to prevent something like what happened today from happening again
@Streaksfriend @Franklin_Graham if they know something related to the terrorism/st, then we need to extract the information however we can
@Streaksfriend @Franklin_Graham and I'm not here to talk about my "track record" for you to decide if I'm a racist or not based on who I voted for.
@Streaksfriend @Franklin_Graham crazy or mentally ill, either way, they do crazy things, and I dont think they can be stopped for the most part
@Streaksfriend @Franklin_Graham how else do you get information from them? plus, they get tortured because we know that they know something. us army didnt grab at random
@Streaksfriend @Franklin_Graham torture of who? terrorists or the innocent? I dont think anyone supports torture of innocent people
@Streaksfriend @Franklin_Graham well if someone is a murderer, in most instances, I'd say they have some screws loose
@Streaksfriend @Franklin_Graham again, it goes back to crazy people. crazy people will kill and then say "jesus told me to" or "allah told me to". Its neither, its THEM
@Streaksfriend @Franklin_Graham not all christians are racist, and not all christians are trump supporters. I'm a christian trump supporter, but not all are.
@Streaksfriend @Franklin_Graham since when do christians endorse torture? you mean torture of terrorists who deserve every bad thing they get?
@Streaksfriend @Franklin_Graham true but you are more likely to be able to tell if someone is breaking into your house than if a crazy guy gets a gun
@Streaksfriend @Franklin_Graham and why cant we blame the mentally ill? a normal person doesnt do this stuff. only crazies do
@Streaksfriend @Franklin_Graham I lock my doors in hopes of keeping myself and my family safe. and yes I am a christian
@Streaksfriend @Franklin_Graham ...one way or the other. black market, illegally, etc.
@Streaksfriend @Franklin_Graham true, so dont allow mentally ill people to buy guns. but with all the guns in this country, would be pretty hard for them to NOT get one...
@Streaksfriend @Franklin_Graham ...know that until they are already here
@Streaksfriend @Franklin_Graham we shouldnt allow mentally ill people to get guns. and even though the muslim immigrants that are terrorists are mentally ill, no way to...
@Streaksfriend @Franklin_Graham white males owning guns is protected by the constitution. guaranteeing chain migration from terrorist prone areas is not.
@Streaksfriend @Franklin_Graham most mass shooters are white. its not racist. most terrorists are muslim. its not racist. these are just unfortunate facts
@Streaksfriend @Franklin_Graham how is it racist? thats like me saying that you're "you are more likely to die from a white shooter than a muslim immigrant" is racist.
@Streaksfriend @Franklin_Graham thats true, but unfortunately, that white shooter would already be in this country. we have enough crazies here at home, why bring more in
@Streaksfriend @Franklin_Graham it clearly hasnt worked, so why not change it to ban those from muslim majority countries, where most of the terrorists come from
@Streaksfriend @Franklin_Graham Tbh, I dont think there IS an answer. And on a side note, thats what the left does when it comes to immigrant terrorism.
@Streaksfriend @Franklin_Graham I dont think an assault weapons ban would stop a crazy guy like this. Criminals dont follow laws
@Streaksfriend @Franklin_Graham I understand we can make it harder. But I believe that crazy people will do crazy things, and it cant prevented.
@Streaksfriend @Franklin_Graham how would gun control stop a mass murderer? there are ways to get assault weapons, even if they wouldnt be allowed to be sold anymore
@MJVentrice what does this mean in english?
@RyanLGallagher @AMSweather Will this be a final transition to cold weather?
@Anaridis cant forget the one in december 2016 in germany at the christmas market
@MendyWax @AMSweather crazy or brainwashed, it has the same effect. unfortunately, I dont see what we can do about either
@MendyWax @AMSweather I understand. I'm just saying that no matter what we do, we cant stop people like this. Crazy people will do crazy things no matter what
@AMSweather criminals will do anything. thats why they are criminals. nothing can make them follow the law
@AMSweather You can never stop crazy people. No way tp stop car attack and no way of preventing a crazy guy like paddock and others of killing people
@NorthEast_Wx in this dry slot, will we see the winds die down?
@NorthEast_Wx @AMSweather @stormpaulpoulos actually seems pretty good, not surprised. seems more accurate than what some of the "experts" said the past few days
@AMSweather what do you think the highest wind gusts will be for Queens, NY? thanks
@weatherwilly what/when do you think the highest wind gusts for NYC? great updates by the way
@crankywxguy do you think NYC could see gusts up to or past 60 mph as well? thanks, you're a great follow
@RWPUSA why isnt  Keith Olbermann suspended then?
@Breaking911 thats one hell of a bird
@keithboykin @Twitter Not that I agree with what he is saying, but how is it racist. I just see insults, nothing racial
@AMSweather If anything, now with Luther Strange, Jeff Flake, and Bob Corker leaving office, this is even better for Trump in 2018 and 2020
@spann any word on tornados from yesterday?
@tena_stout @NWSNorman was this from a seperate tornado?
@iCyclone was this your favorite season?
@AMSweather I hope the younger generation, (which is my generation) actually takes the time to learn for themselves
@AMSweather same thing here in NYC. All I witness are different races helping eachother in times of need, not "extreme racism" like MSM says
@NancySinatra What are we resisting exactly?
@islivingston how has our democracy been assaulted? im genuinely curious
@realDonaldTrump why is it that ISIS is just starting to dissapear now? what happened the last few years? why wasnt this done before?
@iCyclone been seeing a lot of people on here bascially imply that ever weather event is caused by climate change. To me, it just seems like patterns
@Truey777 @ABC how is mogadishu us territory
@MariekeBreizh @Keknocrat @bigtrix36 @weatherchannel But the water that it's over isn't that warm right now. It also strengthened due to less wind shear
@MariekeBreizh @Keknocrat @bigtrix36 @weatherchannel If just seems to me that weather repeats itself. Debbie, Ophelia in Ireland. Leads m to believe there were/will be others
@Keknocrat @MariekeBreizh @bigtrix36 @weatherchannel Yep, the earth has been around for billions of years. Who's to say there hasn't been a major hurricane even farther north
@MariekeBreizh @bigtrix36 @weatherchannel so basically the climate is always changing?
@stoppbaio @pulte whats wrong with what bill said?
@bigtrix36 @weatherchannel hurricane debbie 1961 same story. was it climate change then?
@RichardEngel So he shouldn't address the situation with Iran. Instead he should just sit in the WH doing what?
@technosoul @joshvoydik @SenSanders And whose fault is that? The white people. Nah. Plenty of successful black people to have as role models
@ericfisher NOAA predicted a warmer than normal winter a few years back. It was quite the opposite. It looks like they just copy the last forecast over
@KenDilanianNBC Why can't girls join girl scouts? That's what it's for isn't it
@RogueSithKiller @Blondoid @MichaelRMoats @KenDilanianNBC Why else would he join?

@FHWxN @NWSGSP how many confirmed so far? thanks
@DrShepherd2013 NOAA and CPC have been very accurate over the past few years? Yeah right. I remember all the "warmer than normal" for NE. Opposite happened
@brianklaas I guess itll be a long 7 years for those always complaining. Good to see liberal reactions though, always getting funnier
@cattu @DaneeRiggs @amariamontoya @ThompsonMelon @TheMoralLeft @AP colleges accept people by grades. if your grades are good enough they'll accept you. you cant expect them to just take a POC because of skin
@cattu @DaneeRiggs @amariamontoya @ThompsonMelon @TheMoralLeft @AP credibility of this image? there must be something that those POC are doing to get the bachelors degree that the others arent-working harder
@cattu @DaneeRiggs @amariamontoya @ThompsonMelon @TheMoralLeft @AP No college denies you due to race, and after that... its up to you to make the most of your career. Plenty of blacks rise through ranks
@cattu @DaneeRiggs @amariamontoya @ThompsonMelon @TheMoralLeft @AP the "didnt he" part was being fecetious. And still, how is it harder if they hae the same grades. Colleges accept you, despite being black
@DaneeRiggs @cattu @amariamontoya @ThompsonMelon @TheMoralLeft @AP so a black person cant become a judge? they cant become cops? they cant become lawyers? A black guy became a supreme court judge, didnt he?
@cattu @amariamontoya @DaneeRiggs @ThompsonMelon @TheMoralLeft @AP so if they try real hard in school, you're saying they cant grow up and have a great job? they cant do community service, join clubs, etc?
@cattu @amariamontoya @DaneeRiggs @ThompsonMelon @TheMoralLeft @AP Who is stopping a black person from becoming a senator? Thats right, they do it to themselves No one prevents you from being a success today
@Maljay2003 @clthomason @namaste_am @AP why are minorities still in those conditions? I dont know, ask fellow minorities. Clean up your neighborhoods, break the cycle of poverty
@amariamontoya @DaneeRiggs @ThompsonMelon @TheMoralLeft @AP white privilege? is that how you get millions of poor white people and rich black people like Ben Carson and Oprah?
RT @GregAbbott_TX: RT if you agree @VP Pence was right to leaves Colts game  because of national anthem protest. #tcot #PJNET  https://t.co…
@Glenn_OBX @ABC what are they protesting?
@AMSweather I dont know what they will accomplish by hyping. The people that live in these areas will be able to tell that its not as strong as they say
@AMSweather Maybe the NHC forgot the difference between gusts and sustained winds?
@earthskyscience @SarahDillingham This picture makes it look like Kim Jong Un kept his promise
@weatheroptics I seriously doubt that. Areas east of New Orleans-sure. But New Orleans is on the left side which is very weak.
@DHolla24 @amprog @WCraigFugate and since hurricanes are a natural occurance, that means that the effects resulting from a cyclone are natural. natural disasters
@DHolla24 @amprog @WCraigFugate I did, but even if humans didnt develop along coast, coasts would still be devastated even without homes, leading it to still be a disaster
@amprog @WCraigFugate so a hurricane is manmade thing? guess you learn something new everyday
@AMSweather maybe this storm would bust open the GW claims
@AMSweather do you think it was possibly a hybrid like sandy? hurricane conditions at coast with heaby inland snow?
@stock73 @GovRauner Agreed. Let plan Parenthood be funded by donations only, not my taxes
@AMSweather @Cyclonebiskit Puerto Rico needed more plans put in place for disaster rsponse knowing how vulnerable they were. All that can be done now is send aid

@BeckyM9637 @tedterry1 @babysgramma @TheMarkPantano same here. there are too many arguments that get out of hand on social media
@BeckyM9637 @tedterry1 @babysgramma @TheMarkPantano its not really a mistake to blow people up or run them over.  bad enough we have criminal citizens here already, we dont need terrorists too
@BeckyM9637 @tedterry1 @babysgramma @TheMarkPantano probably less than one percent of refugees are terrorists. but inside that one percent, lots of lives are lost
@BeckyM9637 @tedterry1 @babysgramma @TheMarkPantano this recent london bomber was a syrian refugee. all it takes is one bad refugee. is it worth it to take that risk?
@BeckyM9637 @tedterry1 @babysgramma @TheMarkPantano yet the refugees from those war torn countries are the ones that commit terrorism. we shouldn't worry about our own people getting blown up?
@BeckyM9637 @tedterry1 @babysgramma @TheMarkPantano yet when the rest of the world needs something, U.S. is the first to help. if other countries hate us that much, maybe we shouldnt help

@weatherwilly does that mean you dont like what you see? as in, so far, do you see a snowless winter?
@alroker what is even going on here?
@AMSweather I'm surprised for a storm with sustained winds of 115 mph that the gusts are up to 135. I've seen a lot stronger storms with gusts lower
@AMSweather I dont get why people these days seem to despise independent thinkers like yourself. The gov isnt ALWAYS right
@Breaking911 its actually hong kong
@RyanMaue marco island isnt sparsely populated at all
@BernadetteWoods @StephanieAbrams its not from this storm everyone
@pppapin @NOAA_HurrHunter what do you think the landfall intenstiy will be? thanks, and I love the updates!
@pppapin @NOAA_HurrHunter are the observations supporting a category 2?
@MikeTheiss where does it all go?
@capitalweather and why does this signal climate change? more damage? thats because there is more damage to be done.
@MichaelRLowry what does this mean in english? thanks
@dekiddisreddy @EdValleeWx borderline Category 2/3
@jonathanfalwell what island is this?
@EdValleeWx @weatherchannel I'm stuck on the "showers" part
@RyanMaue and it is still steady at 185 mph. I'm curious to see how strong it is over there
@Thermikz @Goli8821 @RyanMaue this would be devastating. worse than wilma
@Thermikz @Goli8821 @RyanMaue and look how much damage it caused to Florida even though it was a Cat 3 offshore
@EdValleeWx is it just me or had it shifted to the west a bit
@EdValleeWx you think that is bad? look at the comments. If you need a laugh, the comments are the best thing to look at
@crankywxguy I'd say the Carolinas are at the biggest threat now. Though a cat 5 off of Miami can't be good
@spann most take the track right into southern florida
@gifuoh @hurricanetrack I understand. Hopefully the forecasting improves over the next few days. My thinking is that SoFla will take a direct hit
@AMSweather is that Saint Martin?
@gifuoh @hurricanetrack It makes a big difference though if people would like to know where the strongest winds are and where the the highest storm surge would be
@hurricanetrack I find it interesting how the Euro and GFS are such opposites. GFS doesnt bring Irma ashore, Euro takes it into the West coast
@AMSweather what is the island below the 5? Its in the direct path of the eye
@MJVentrice is that a sign of strengthening
@Anaridis @BostonSchools @SuptChang they are- if they aren't illegal. Law and order, thats how it goes

@gopfashionista @Fumingcustomer @Harlan @realDonaldTrump There is always a catch. Whenever the government gets involved, bad things happen

@Fumingcustomer @gopfashionista @Harlan @realDonaldTrump because the middle class gets shafted by it. Why should we be hurt just for people who never wanted healthcare?
@SenJohnMcCain @UNHumanRights Instead of worrying about Venezuela, care about the people in your own country first. America First, not venezuela.
@PeterGleick Is Irma in the carribean? Yeah, I didnt think so. Good try though
@abragwell @BigJoeBastardi @pastorbaird I know. This guy is right almost all the time. Its actually freakish at this point
@NorthEast_Wx is this good news for the Miami area?
@wall_cloud @Geostrophic and a mess with significant weather
@AMSweather I think Harvey and Irma are really a teaching moment that the models always shift and around and nothing is set in stone until it happens
@menkesfilm @AKBravesFan98 @FLGovScott Do you guys actually think climate change made Harvey worse? Are you aware of the fact that it produced so much rain cuz 2 HPs made it stall
@BigJoeBastardi Hermine?
@nynjpaweather @weatheroptics Do you think this is the "big one" that Miami area always feared?
@weatheroptics Of course it's helpful. Real weather news and easy to understand
@AMSweather @JayB7897 Do you believe it has any relevance in this situation
RT @WayneDupreeShow: If you echo this sentiment, 		An Amen = RT 		#DACA https://t.co/lUZZtxLaHZ
@AMSweather Thanks for the update. Side question, is the CMC model reliable for hurricanes?
@AMSweather In your opinion, do you think Irma can hit the SNE/NYC area or would it be more of a Carolina threat, like the models show?
@NorthEast_Wx @albo1912 That could be good. Or it could be bad
@NorthEast_Wx @albo1912 does that increase or decrease the chance of U.S impact?
@NorthEast_Wx When do you think that might be? And thank you for not making your weather hype-based. Good work!
@MPalmerTWC They were warning about catastrophic flooding on Wednesday. The floods didnt start until Saturday. They had 48-72 hours to get out
@NorthEast_Wx I see. I thought that would put them in agreement. I guess not. Oh well. I'd say we probably wont know for sure until mid next week
RT @PrisonPlanet: The left is losing its shit over these pics of happy black people asking for Trump selfies.		It would be a shame if you r…
@SnowLover1337 @AMSweather didnt the GFS push Irma ashore? If the upper air patterns verify, which model would be accurate? They're opposites even with same upper air
@NorthEast_Wx I thought it turned out to sea didnt it? Didnt GFS have it going into DelMarVa? Or do I have it wrong?
@AMSweather I wonder if they even believe what they say
@AMSweather I saw people screaming in all caps about how everyone will be wiped out if they don't move away because "A CAT 7". Some garbage like that
@StormFrontWX @GabClark6 That's a great argument. Alright hop into bed then. I guess get some rest
@GabClark6 @StormFrontWX I'm agreeing with you. It's great that he donated something
@StormFrontWX @GabClark6 Alright, so tell me, what did I miss? And he has 4 billion dollars, and you dont need 14 billion to donate 1 million
@aninetiespru @AMSweather Actually some of our fellow Americans are scum. Example: KKK and Antifa. They are also scum. And no "helpful thinking" can change the MSM
@iCyclone @RyanMaue This might sound dumb, but what would the ridge cause the storm to do after that? I'm sure I've heard the answer, I just cant remember
@StormFrontWX @GabClark6 Is there something wrong with making money these days? What'd I miss?

@TheHappyPelican @skjunior24 @NorthEast_Wx thanks!
@skjunior24 @NorthEast_Wx thanks guys. we'll just have to wait and see I suppose
@skjunior24 @NorthEast_Wx Doesnt the GFS come in earlier?
@AMSweather and then they wonder why Trump/supporters hate MSM so much. Used to watch Morning Joe, now I cant even look at them
@AMSweather weird to believe that they have such a mindset of "no matter what Trump does, its bad" I didnt like Obama's politics but I respected him
@AMSweather I actually saw on CNN that their "exper pundits" were saying "Trump donated $1 Million to score poltical pointss" He just cant win with them
@NorthEast_Wx what time does the Euro come out?
@AMSweather Well, that was...interesting
@kenashgrammy @FoxNews and they call republicans the hateful ones. disgraceful

@StephenJBender @NBC6News @Ameachum6 thanks for the report
@StephenJBender @NBC6News any flooding in houses?
@SarahDillingham last I heard, it was 20
@MeahBottoms @GovChristie @NJNationalGuard if you were one of the people rescued by what he is sending down there-albeit not much, you would be grateful
@weatherwilly looking forward to it as usual
@AMSweather @crankywxguy And then they would call us a "cult of government haters" for criticizing them
@AMSweather @crankywxguy And then afterwards "meteorologists" (more like modelologists) can say it was a forecast win, when its anything but
@AlanJSanders @Skipowski @EWErickson it was 125 mph cat 3 at landfall
@Wxmanms1 where can I find the impact statement?
@LeslieGoldman4 @HurdOnTheHill @safoodbank why should he address something that doesnt exist
@weatheroptics where'd you find this map of pendind calls for rescue?
@drjonackroyd me, because harvey produced all this rain because it stalled over land in between 2 pieces of high pressure. It's happened before, AGW then?
@schachin @LK64076007A @HCSOTexas @ReadyHarris I'm sorry, I dont. Its just that I know people in Houston and I was wondering if those that need help are nearby
@schachin @LK64076007A @HCSOTexas @ReadyHarris where can people find this rescue list online?
@USofDisaster @WeatherKait I hope I'm wrong too, but I think that since 2005, people learned the mistakes they made during that evacuation. Plus factor in non evacuees
@USofDisaster @WeatherKait I belive the death toll will be higher than 100 by the time all is set and done in Houston and the burbs.
@AMSweather dont even waste your words on this guy. Some people will never realize
@WeatherKait the roads didnt start flooding until Saturday night, they had 72 hours to evacuate. Plus, not everyone evacuates, and some do it by air
@NWSSanAntonio @MananaZoo @SanAntonioZoo thanks
@NWSSanAntonio @MananaZoo @SanAntonioZoo Sorry, but one more question: Has it reached its cret yet?
@NWSSanAntonio @MananaZoo @SanAntonioZoo are any homes flooding in Cuero? Thanks
@WeatherKait It seems to me like there was a broad region of 24 plus and the potential of up to 50 inches.
@WeatherKait They were warning of this flooding 72 hours in advance. And people that cant afford a hotel or cant evacuate by car can get bussed
@WeatherKait maybe its time to evacuate based on rainfall then. Its trapping as many people as storm surge. Water is water. Water kills, rainfall or not
@mikebettes only thing is-Houston is stuck right in the middle
@weatherwilly just checked, and yes, they do. I wouldnt be surprised if #harvey causes as much damage as katrina by the time its finished
@weatherwilly doesnt New Orleans have flood pump issues nowadays anyway? Plus, its great seeing your forecasts in winter. Cant wait to see some this year!
@weatherwilly Personally, I'm concerned about the increasing threat for a heavy band of rain tonight and tomorrow morning in New Orleans as well
@weatherwilly wow, thats really bad, considering a levee is being overtopped in inverness subdivision right now
@weatherwilly how long do you think this heavy rain band will remain over houston for?
@NorthEast_Wx @crankywxguy I questioned @wxjerdman once, just once, and I was immediately blocked.
@sandrareneetx @TxStormChasers @KhokharTX where in houston is that?
@GretaLWall @OANN I saw that up to 5 died saturday night
@weatheroptics I heard it was 12? 11 in Houston and 1 in rockport.
@ChrisTheCripple @mshellsrosie @MarkRuffalo What science? I thought major hurricanes were going to be the norm. Only took 12 years for another one to make landfall
@weatheroptics are there any flooded homes in Beaumont, or is the media just ginoring it because of the disaster in Houston?
@TariqSiddiqi You know that if he didnt do anything, people would complain, he does stuff, people complain. He cant win when it comes to you guys

@TariqSiddiqi @AP @POTUS he's going to texas tomorrow. do you want him to rescue the people himself?
@TaniaonFox7 thank you
RT @usatodayvideo: Drone footage shows the full impact of #HurricaneHarvey. https://t.co/M5X4EL528y https://t.co/cbebOLS6zP
@TaniaonFox7 where is that located in la grange
@joshstephenwfaa @TxStormChasers @wfaachannel8 where exactly is that in Houston?
@maharshipatel @RepLoBiondo I know how it works clearly you dont because "global warming" or CO2 wouldnt stall a storm over Texas. No wind aloft to steer it, look it up
@maharshipatel @RepLoBiondo this isnt climate change. Harvey got stuck between two pieces of high pressure. Happened with allison 2001, flora 1963 and others
@beth_project8 @commoncents1234 @OLAASM @ChurnDashSlash @washingtonpost no one does...except for them
@beth_project8 @commoncents1234 @OLAASM @ChurnDashSlash @washingtonpost its true. CNN said "Antifa seeks peace through violence"
@Rohani_MD @JeffLindner1 I believe it is set to happen in the morning isn't it?
@ReedTimmerAccu I'd say a likely tornado considering power flashes are coming out of that area
@NorthEast_Wx I think people will torn between the governor teling them to evacuate and the mayor saying it wouldnt be as bad as expected so dont evacuate
@SirStuartMcLean @CyrusFirth very strong argument. using memes. harvey is stuck between 2 pieces of high pressure. CO2 and "climate change" doesnt effect where hp stalls
@melissamorris50 flood water has entered the medical center?
@shannonrwatts @eugenegu @SusanAsplund You do realize he has tweeted his thoughts and prayers many times. For someone lookking at his tweets, your eyes must be evading you
@SirStuartMcLean @realDonaldTrump so even if he believed in climate change, the hurricanes would just dissapear
@bob_black1984 its the mayor's job not the president's job to call for evacuation
@AMSweather @AdamArob It took me a while to convince my family to turn off CNN. In defense of CNN and the media, years ago, they werent as biased imo.
@AdamArob @AMSweather probably majority on social media
@AMSweather Yep. I cant even disagree with a liberal without being called a "klansmen" or a "bot". Sad that people cant respect different opinions
@Mooque @weatheroptics Its sad to see. I feel bad for them. Clearly they couldnt evacuate themselves, they can barely move. I hope we dont see more of this
@Mooque @weatheroptics Really? I heard other people saying it was fake because of the way people were sitting, and how the fabric wasnt wet, etc.  My apologies
@weatheroptics its fake. dont retweet this please. its proven to be fake
@PledgeDemocracy @WxGrimReaper @truyogi @Autwachler @NWS @yousitonmyspot most models showed a hurricane or a major hurricane. NHC ignored it 3 days prior
@lookner After his handling of the situation in Charlottesville, he shouldn't even be allowed
@AMSweather thats why I follow you and other non government mets. At this point paid mets have been wrong too many times, and they dont want to learn
@mattlanza @crankywxguy do you believe this steady heavy rain will last into tomorrow or just overnight?
@WeatherInTheHud @crankywxguy is it quickly moving?
@weatheroptics Has the general GFS model cought on to it yet?
@hurricanetrack have you heard about any damage in Palacios?
@John__Dillon @ReedTimmerAccu @breakingweather supposedly in port aransas a mobile home park was completely leveled
@NorthEast_Wx Where can I find what the Euro is forecasting?
@hurricanetrack did you hear from anyone in Palacios?
@NorthEast_Wx I'm surprised. Not saying its wrong, just seems to be an outlier
@wx_virginia @AMSweather I cant believe the NHC is calling this a major win for their forecasting. They didnt use much common sense this time around
@NorthEast_Wx do you belive it will go back over the gulf and make landfall again as a cat 1?
@hurricanetrack I the water still rising?
@MichaelRLowry Do you think homes will be inundated in palacios or Port o Connor?
@RobMarciano I would be worried about port o Connor and palacios with this onshore surge
@AMSweather They went by models I guess. But it's supposed to be meteorology not modelology
@AMSweather When do you think it will weaken to a tropical storm?
@NorthEast_Wx what is the pressure at this point as per hurricane hunters?
@weatheroptics does this involve the brown ocean effect?
@NorthEast_Wx @TheWeatherMastr @BostonMetroWx do you think the winds will be up to 135 mph? I honestly doubt it. I think the wind speeds have plateaud at this point
@AMSweather gust to 131 in port aransas as of last observation
@iCyclone were those power flashes?
@AlexJLamers makes me think that it is holding on to its category 4 intensity as it makes landfall
@NorthEast_Wx Port Aransas just clocked 116 mph
@NorthEast_Wx Thats about 6 mph. It looks to be stalling while trying to make landfall at the same time.
@iCyclone I heard the Rockport mayor told people who stayed behind to put their social security and name on their arm if they stay behind
@weatheroptics what was the max in the the last forecast
@NorthEast_Wx is it moving slower or is it just me?
@AMSweather Not that it matters, but isn't it a cat 4 at this point
@AMSweather hopefully the death toll wont be higher. Matthew was bad enough with 49 fatalities
@AMSweather do you think it will cause more damage than matthew? Matthew cause 10 billion
@nymetrowx Just one more question: Do you believe it will cause more damage than matthew did last year?
@nymetrowx Do you think the next update will show a 130 mph cat 4?
@iCyclone look at those structures, they will definitely be flooded through
@Mars_Hill_WX @NorthEast_Wx It is still forecast to be a hurricane tomorrow afternoon. Morning is a lock for hurricane force winds
RT @hurricanetrack: Are you serious? This is absolutely astounding please share this and make sure people understand what this means. https…
@Mars_Hill_WX @NorthEast_Wx 6:19 tomorrow morning will still have hurricane force winds in those areas
@Mars_Hill_WX @NorthEast_Wx That means about 1.8 to 2.4 feet more of surge than they predicted. So 9 to 12 can now become 11 to 14
@Mars_Hill_WX @NorthEast_Wx so the faster the storm, the higher the surge?
@Mars_Hill_WX @NorthEast_Wx I think prolonged storm surge will be an issue as well
@NorthEast_Wx @Mars_Hill_WX I guess thats why the rainfall forecasts haven't changed
@MiScan5000 @TropicalTidbits yeah its up to 125 mph and pressure down to 941 mb
@AMSweather do you believe it has a shot at category 4 strength?
@NorthEast_Wx does that lower the rainfall forecast for Texas
@MiScan5000 @TropicalTidbits does it have a shot at cat 4?
@TropicalTidbits are the winds still increasing?
@hurricanetrack are you putting up any more cameras?
@AlexJLamers Is it possible to get to a category 4?
@MJVentrice do you think it will strengthen further?
@TropicalTidbits That means the winds are about 111 mph, cat 3 force
@weatheroptics do you expect the winds to increase before landfall?
@wxbrad would that increase the wind speed?
@HenryMargusity @nynjpaweather which means what exactly?
@spann Maybe something similar to the EURO prediction may occur afterall
@NorthEast_Wx what time do you believe it will make landfall?
@NorthEast_Wx where did you find that?
@NorthEast_Wx thank you
@NorthEast_Wx If you get the chance, can you explain what all the talk is about an eye wall replacement cycle this morning?
@NorthEast_Wx do you believe it will make it to category 3 strength
@MichaelRLowry why is it the most important?
@NickWalther @SmartOfDarkness @gdimeweather @bomani_jones @weatherchannel alison did the same. Hurricane Celia dumped 100 inches in cuba. Hurricane Camille dumped 25+ in Virginia. Same in East PA from Agnes in 1972
@AlexJLamers does this prevent strengthening?
@Breaking911 that is honestly the most stupid thing I have ever heard
@ReedTimmerAccu @AccuWeatherPro this leads to a stronger storm right?
@JerryStahr @RyanMaue That's a big drop in pressure then, almost unbelievable
@RyanMaue Does that mean the pressure has dropped hat much since the 5 A.M advisory?
@weatherchannel What I don't understand is how this isn't trending on social media
@GregPostel What does SFMR mean
@Wxmanms1 @wxbrad When is the next recon pass?
@NorthEast_Wx @BostonMetroWx I think what we have seen with this storm is that pressure doesn't determine winds
@ericfisher Do you believe it will slow down on it's approach to Texas
@NorthEast_Wx @ahmuZe_ Thanks and good work!
@NorthEast_Wx @ahmuZe_ Just curious. Do you think landfall will be in corpus Christi or to the north?
@NorthEast_Wx @ahmuZe_ I assume they will upgrade the winds at 2 A.M?
@NorthEast_Wx @ahmuZe_ When do you think the wind speeds will catch up
@BigJoeBastardi that would unload even more storm surge into Matagora bay/ Calhoun County
RT @RealJack: Do you plan on voting for President Donald J. Trump in 2020? Vote and retweet! 🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸
@Melissa07157472 @luvstravel @weatherchannel @POTUS yeah there wasnt one word, there were about 20. He gave a response soon after
@NorthEast_Wx winds are weaker? or the storm overall? The last I checked, the pressure was down to 969 to 970 mb
@AMSweather do you think they'll go offline during the majority of the storm?
@Pete_Riches @jord1787 @NHC_Atlantic this isnt a result of global warming. Hurricanes in the past have done the same. Look it up
@NorthEast_Wx where are you getting this data from
@RyanMaue shows landfall around Rockport. Yikes
@AMSweather same to you as always
@AMSweather seems to make landfall north of corpus christi if it stays on this track
@AMSweather thanks! it should come in handy for this storm
@wxmvpete @crankywxguy @EskimoJoe492 you think that'll help it get to major hurricane status
@AMSweather I remember last year for Hurricane Hermine, you found some good webcams. Do you know what website that was? Thanks!
RT @WayneDupreeShow: Would you vote down an Obama statue after eight years of his presidency? 		Retweet - Yes	Favorite - No https://t.co/7v…
@AMSweather thats not good. Not saying it'll be the same but the prolonged onshore winds remind me of the Sandy situation in NYC/NJ
@AMSweather The prolonged onshore wind over there, or wherever it makes landfall will make for some very bad surge issues. Are they low lying there too?
@AMSweather cant that mean eye wall replacement is underway, meaning it can come out even stronger?
@CristCacewx I'd say one of my biggest concerns is the prolonged onshore wind due to little movement. That will definitely increase the surge
@JMGarciaRivera @garrettbastardi @RyanMaue @iCyclone do you think that will help it reach cat 3+
@JMGarciaRivera @garrettbastardi @RyanMaue @iCyclone which means what exactly?
@OkieBMac @RyanMaue Thanks. Good source
@DonaldUS2016 @RyanMaue No, I was wrong, you were right. I wasnt talking about the eye of the hurricane, which was the topic of discussion
@OkieBMac @RyanMaue Oh I see. I was thinking of the storms in the outer bands and the eyewall. Not nescessarily the eye. My apologies
@DonaldUS2016 @RyanMaue Interesting, I looked it up and it said the exact opposite
@HurricaneProApp thanks for the info
@RyanMaue what do warmer cloud tops mean?
@HurricaneProApp do you still predict it will be a cat3+ at landfall? thanks in advance
@HurricaneProApp surprised it hasnt been upgraded further. makes me wonder
@MJVentrice doesnt look like it will have enough time to strengthen into a cat 3 or cat 4
@Babyy__P @TropicalTidbits curious to see what the wind speeds will be up to at the next advisory
@TropicalTidbits thats stronger than before, right?

@TropicalTidbits only plus side is that Matagorda bay area is very unpopulated
@jhomenuk @weatherwilly I'm surprised it isnt a hurricane yet
RT @MIGOP: Retweet to Stop Stabenow in 2018! #LeadRight @NRSC @GOP @GOPChairwoman https://t.co/LJWPQFhlOK
@itsbigroballen @WrightDobbs @TropicalTidbits well, thank you for the information. I guess we wait and see at this point
@WrightDobbs @TropicalTidbits thanks! does that strengthen the storm?
@TropicalTidbits what does that mean? an eye inversion?
@RyanMaue still scary to see that Houston is still projected to get 15 inches or more.
@JordanRobinso1 @philklotzbach thank you
@ronyan1 @MichaelRLowry Wow I could see the rapid intensification from last night to this morning
@philklotzbach What was the wind at landfall?
@ronyan1 @MichaelRLowry I didn't see it yet. I'll look now. Where can I find images of it
@AMSweather @Jackson_Dill either way... over the last year I feel NHC has had some issues. Not saying their job is easy but...
@AMSweather @Jackson_Dill thats what I said. People will look at graphics more than details. Just human nature
@BigJoeBastardi how are you always right all the time, I dont get it
@iCyclone I think they are just emphasizing it now because it's been a while
@ronyan1 @MichaelRLowry I see. But the NHC still has it as 35 mph
@mikebettes @weatherchannel @DrRickKnabb #wutv when do you think the models will come together? Thanks and I love your show!
@ronyan1 @MichaelRLowry It doesnt seem to be strengthening that much right now based on satellite. Then again I dont know much what I'm looking at
@HurricaneProApp do you see it strengthening?
@Jackson_Dill I saw the UKMET with HI-RES models with major hurricane status
@ronyan1 @MichaelRLowry hopefully by tomorrow morning the models will be in a better consensus
@CarberryMatthew @MarkWBennett @KathrynProciv I think the overall message is "Its been a long time, buckle up guys"
@CarberryMatthew @MarkWBennett @KathrynProciv by she I meant @KathrynProciv
@CarberryMatthew @MarkWBennett @KathrynProciv she is trying to say people might have let their guard down since it has been so long
@ronyan1 @MichaelRLowry This was an original thought of mine after I saw it was sitting over 87 degree waters, but none of the models have suggested RI lately
@MichaelRLowry do you think that could even happen? or just an overblown scenario?
@NeoZeroNumber2 @denise_actress @The_Trump_Train plus if you are in that situation then there is plenty of assistance from the government. And college isnt the only way to get a good job
@NeoZeroNumber2 @denise_actress @The_Trump_Train How do we cling on to greed?  We give our people programs through college to help with expenses while teaching them self worth.
@NeoZeroNumber2 @denise_actress @The_Trump_Train If you dont like America that much, pack up and leave, you wont be missed
@denise_actress @NeoZeroNumber2 @The_Trump_Train If you look hard enough, jobs are there. This is America. It will ALWAYS be the land of opportunity
@denise_actress @NeoZeroNumber2 @The_Trump_Train Spot on. Couldnt say it better myself. Pay what you can, take out loans, FAFSA etc
@NeoZeroNumber2 @denise_actress @The_Trump_Train There are financial aid programs that help you pay for it. This country doesnt completely abandon its people
@NeoZeroNumber2 @denise_actress @The_Trump_Train All the more reason to go to college you are younger and dont have a family to support
@TropicalTidbits what does an amplified ridge mean to the track in this case? thanks!
@hurricanetrack I always love watching your unmanned cams during these storms. The one at the Charleston battery during Matthew was the best I've seen yet
@hurricanetrack They should have projected it to be a hurricane then. Most people look at graphics instead of read. They should read, but you know most dont
@NeoZeroNumber2 @denise_actress @The_Trump_Train the opportunity is there. they just need to want it enough. How do people become successful? They seized the opportunity. Same applies here

@weatheroptics thanks! I always wondered about that
@weatheroptics what happens when there is blocking to the north? how does it affect hurricanes
@realDonaldTrump mountain time or pacific time?
@DerekOrtt @iCyclone well, thanks for the info! We shall see in the coming days what precautions are taken
@DerekOrtt @iCyclone do they have evacuation zones for rainfall flooding as well?
@DerekOrtt @iCyclone They do that for rainfall? I was unaware, I thought they only did that for river flooding
@iCyclone @DerekOrtt is it just me or should they evacuate for rainfall like storm surge? evacuate the most rainfall flood prone areas like they do for surge
@iCyclone I heard that the gfs was more bullish?
@AMSweather I'd say rainfall flooding is the highest threat. Maybe storm surge but most models show only a weak hurricane

@rj_0321 @RepLaHood So is connecting the right to the alt right a tactic to delegitimize the right?

@advoc8tr @MrsSheaWong @darthur111 @The_Mann_Report @MichaelCohen212 @POTUS @realDonaldTrump You protest against them. You dont throw urine, beat them up with bats and expect them to take it all. Thats what leads to an all out brawl

@barryslee @realPolitiDiva @mitchellvii For those that lost insurance and left them with few options and had to switch around plans and find new doctors-it is bad
@barryslee @realPolitiDiva @mitchellvii And many people lost insurance. Win for some, lose for others
@barryslee @realPolitiDiva @mitchellvii My point is that even though it benefited some, it really hurt others
@barryslee @realPolitiDiva @mitchellvii so the middle class should have gotten shafted by those who never wanted insureance to begin with?

@philklotzbach how is ACE calculated?
@BigJoeBastardi It was really a great book. All kids these days should give it a good read
@kinzay_licious so this should apply to the left not blaming all whites for KKK violence, right?
@MyDaughtersArmy As if all the liberals didnt do that during what happened in Charlottesville
@robynyourbank @McJesse I think at this point it is better to let it stay where it is. The bigger problem imo, is granting KKK permits to rally
@robynyourbank @McJesse I really dont think taking down a statue of a Confederate will show unity. It seems to me some people just dont want to be unified
@robynyourbank @McJesse So if its in public, its being praised, but if its in a Museum, its being observed?
@robynyourbank @McJesse Otherwise it wuld only be fair to take down every statue that depicts a violent or racist person. A lot of statues would have to be removed
@robynyourbank @McJesse I think the money used to take down the statues can be put to other things. You have to find room in the museums first
@ILoveDJTrump @RealJack Me too. If I had a dollar for all the times I have been called a "Bot" just for disagreeing with a liberal, I could buy Trump's old house
@robynyourbank @McJesse Also, who says people wont go to those Museums and praise the monuments there. If they do it outside, they can surely do it inside
@robynyourbank @McJesse Unless you take down all statues of all people deemed "racist", its not fair just to pick and choose what you take down.
@McJesse So you think all those statues should be taken down? Its a piece of history. Cant change what you dont like

@AtHomeInBk @Breaking911 Not every single one of his supporters are white supremacists. Its like saying all Democrat supporters are part of violent BLM, antifa
@BrownTiti @Breaking911 @Smith83K There is an alt-left. Violent black lives matter members and antifa members that are violent
@gigglemitz @Scotttaylorva Trump condemned them. He seems to be the only republican capable of doing that
@AMSweather I swear I wish we could just arrest them. Or send them off to fight so they know what sacrifices are made to protect that flag. smh
@afreedma Yeah, condemning both sides is really neo Nazi. Other than that, keep retweeting nonsensical articles @afreedma
@TitaniumTestis @ScottPresler At least Trump did it yesterday. I cant even begin to understand why he was slammed for it though. Violence on both sides
@JeffFlake Condemn them all. KKK, Antifa and BLM. They are all violent racists. It's good to address both violent sides. It takes 2 to tango
@baberuthbomber8 @Breaking911 There is a place in Utah called utah county. This could be the mayor of that county
@NWSCheyenne wasnt a tornado already reported with this storm?

@je_baird @hadikasrawi @AMSweather Ok, if thats what you feel, then fine. Have a nice day

@AMSweather I think certain models do better handling certain things.
@Granitepolitics @NateBernitz @dancedwards_dan @GovChrisSununu I know there are goods and bad about Antifa. I know Nazis worship hate and violence. Today there was violence on both sides. Mention both
@je_baird @hadikasrawi @AMSweather We'll just have to agree to disagree. I don't think his base are a bunch of Nazis. I'm, Nazis are opposite of what he preaches
@je_baird @hadikasrawi @AMSweather Bannon I dont approve of.But to say I am a white nationalist because I support Trump is false. Its like saying all Dem voters belong to BLM
@je_baird @hadikasrawi @AMSweather Then they are misinterpreting Trump's message. If I felt Trump hated anyone that wasnt white then I wouldn't have supported him.
@je_baird @hadikasrawi @AMSweather Last I checked, he didnt say anything remotely racist, except what people find "terrorists are muslims" as racist. Other than that...
@hadikasrawi @je_baird @AMSweather Those white nationalist rallies have been happening every year for decades, Trump didnt change that. No one can unless you outlaw it
@martinmincali @11thHour @NicolleDWallace @MSNBC I blame the media. Fear mongering and sensationalism
@AMSweather Which is better in your opinion. GFS or euro
@NateBernitz @dancedwards_dan @GovChrisSununu But violence is never the answer. Protest and rally against it. Stooping down low doesn't make two wrongs a right. Plus BLM has major faults
@NateBernitz @dancedwards_dan @GovChrisSununu I realize that. But it goes back to my original argument. The ones that were violent today were Antifa and the supremacists. Condemn all
@NateBernitz @dancedwards_dan @GovChrisSununu Wasnt it BLM that burnt Ferguson to the ground? And Milwaukee last summer?
@NateBernitz @dancedwards_dan @GovChrisSununu Oh I see. Thank you for correcting me. Either way, both sides incite and commit acts of violent. My point in the first place is condemn ALL
@NateBernitz @dancedwards_dan @GovChrisSununu Some of the people hurt were holding Confederate flag meaning they were the neo Nazis. And Antifa/ counter protestors started fires
@NateBernitz @dancedwards_dan @GovChrisSununu It doesn't defy anything cuz it's true. A right winger wouldn't run over a supremacist. Both the far right and far left commit this violence
@LoTargos @RepMikeCoffman Why especially when it is white nationalism? Violence should be condemned equally no matter the race
@dancedwards_dan Why was it pointless? Now you got me curious
@Sergio35411189 @ananavarro @jmeacham Why? I'm a trump supporter. What is going on there is awful. They are murderers, bigots and need to be shut down immediately
@NateBernitz @dancedwards_dan @GovChrisSununu The guy who ran people over was not one of the supremacists. And Antifa and BLM have history of violence
@AMSweather That's their problem them. I wouldn't abandon anyone over supporting Democrats. People just have to learn to disagree
@NateBernitz @dancedwards_dan @GovChrisSununu I think both sides should be condemned. The supremacists and the violent blm and Antifa members. Condemn them all
@dancedwards_dan He only speaks for himself. But if you mention one side then you should condemn the other
@dancedwards_dan @GovChrisSununu And the violent racist Antifa members
@McFaul But you also have the Antifa violent members, so what does he tell them? They'd slam him for calling them racists
@Canetrakker @iCyclone same with Irene in Queens, NY. Front side just had a lot of rain the backside had no rain, but some pretty good wind gusts. Bit of surge too
@HurricaneProApp That seemed to intensify quite quickly, no?
@je_baird @AMSweather so you are saying every Trump supporter is a Nazi? Thats like saying all Democrat supporters are part of Antifa. Dont generalize
@jk_rowling @scalzi He did tweet about it by the way, so maybe you need an eye doctor or something
@chichester @GregAbbott_TX @TexasGOP How does this supress voting?
@RepKathleenRice @DLoesch how so? I cant become a member without being labeled a "domestic terrorist" but you put up with those violent Antifa members? Shame on you
@Kino360Xperienc @alfmolly @sendavidperdue @AUG_Chronicle If you look it up you find the pros of it and the cons. Then it's up to you how to weigh it as negative or positive
@plainsnomad @UtahEmergency @BeReadyUtah However I believe none of them were confirmed
@ScottPresler I am still confused at how @POTUS lost Virginia in November. I thought it would have pulled through for him. Maybe because of Tim Kaine?
RT @FarmersAlmanac: #BestDays tasks for Aug 12: Dry Fruits and Vegetables, Cut Hair to Slow Growth, Mow... https://t.co/VEw0EC23wn
@AMSweather If it stays this way, it could certainly have an implication on this winter. Warmer water=more fuel for storms
@2453653z @SenJohnThune Do you have something against rich people? I understand they should pay more in taxes but it won't help to tax them to death
@2453653z @SenJohnThune Burdensome on the family and just morally wrong. The government should stay out of my money once I die
@WeatherXwf @iCyclone What was the windspeed at the time of landfall?
@AJUTAH @UtahEmergency @NWSSaltLakeCity To clarify, I belive unofficial means that they cant confirm it was a tornado or a severe storm. Too similar to identify, I'd guess
@AJUTAH @UtahEmergency @NWSSaltLakeCity yes, based on reports
@UtahEmergency @NWSSaltLakeCity ok thanks!
@UtahEmergency @NWSSaltLakeCity Should I message them?
@UtahEmergency @BeReadyUtah How many tornados have there been this year in Utah?
@alfmolly @sendavidperdue @AUG_Chronicle He does which is why he introduced this act to help American citizens
@CT_MA_MT @teri_atthepaper @peterdaou Trump never said the plans werent in place before. He is reassuring everyone that if North Korea attacked, that would be the end of them
@sddphoto @MalcolmNance You guys do know that if North Korea attacked, the United States would just blow them to bits right? I'm sure we have plans in place
@msjgilz @NMalliotakis We need to elect her in November. NYC is neglected under de blasio
@RepKathleenRice @DLoesch When I go to buy a gun that mkes me a security threat? Who knew? Maybe you should tell that to the blacks in Chicago, the real threat
@Skonialo @ScottPresler does it? I am a bit worried that he wont be elected at this point. Northern Virginia will be hard to crack
@EdWGillespie Can Virginians please elect @EdWGillespie ? Unlike Ralph Northam, he actually cares about the common folk. Come on, we can do this!
@AMSweather Things can change very quickly just like last season. And it only takes one.
@wunderground extremes have always happened. make sure to blame this on climate change though
@ReedTimmerAccu @breakingweather Is there a threat for any tornados?
@iCyclone @Canetrakker @gabrielr07 sorry, my bad
@Canetrakker @iCyclone @gabrielr07 There's nothing wrong if you support him. Just like there is nothing wrong with supporting other candidates
@iCyclone @Canetrakker @gabrielr07 That's not what I even implied. But I don't think mexico is in a good state so priorities first
@gabrielr07 @Canetrakker @iCyclone I think they need to get rid of their gangs and secure their border before building a stable radar. Radar is good but other things first
@AMSweather It makes me think of all those storm chasers who get happy at destructive storms. Hurricanes, tornados, floods, etc
@AMSweather No one should be upset at a harmless storm
@mitchellvii More like raring to go and speeding down the race track
@hurricanetrack You think it'll reach hurricane force?
@LaurDeCar @TomiLahren How so?
@LaurDeCar @TomiLahren There are. Look at Obama, I wasnt a fan of him, but he did well for himself. Same with Ben Carson. They dont qualify as successful?
@LaurDeCar @TomiLahren I'm not saying they all complain. You have plenty of successful ones. What I am saying, is why not follow in their shoes? Whining wont help
@LaurDeCar @TomiLahren If he was able to do well for themselves, there is NO excuse why other people cant. Regardless of race, thats what I am trying to get at
@LaurDeCar @TomiLahren As far as the workforce goes, they dont have less opportunities than whites. Plus, he's rich, so why shouldnt they try to follow him then?
@LaurDeCar @TomiLahren My point is that everyone has to pay for college someway or another, so they shouldnt be complaining, whites pay too.
@LaurDeCar @TomiLahren My bad, I didnt realize I deleted that part of the post. It should have read "Meanwhile they want to get free college and are able to work."
@LaurDeCar @TomiLahren He generalizes things with minorities-talking about how they dont have opportunity. Meanwhile they get free college and are able to work
@LaurDeCar @TomiLahren Ok then. So then he shouldnt talk about oppression, since no one truly knows what people go through
@LaurDeCar @TomiLahren He said he actually stands up to "oppression". Everyone in this country has the same opportunity at this stage, it isnt decades ago anymore
@Realjmannarino I thought they made up their minds that Trump "absolutely" colluded with Russia? Somethings not adding up. Oh wait, this is CNN? No wonder
@crankywxguy I'm surprised they havent updated it to hurricane force already
@ZackGianino @ScottPresler And the economy is booming right now. Restructuring trade deals dont kill relationships, which is what many say. It just gives a level field
@BOOMAWOKE @RustledURJimmys @AlHenn_Bhz It isnt. How do you know white people dont work as hard as Mexicans? Or asians dont work as hard as Mexicans?
@BOOMAWOKE @RustledURJimmys @AlHenn_Bhz Its not objective who works the hardest
@ZackGianino @ScottPresler How are our realtions not as stronger than before? By putting America first over other nations? They have their leaders, we have ours
@ZackGianino @ScottPresler And you know how the rest of the world views us? Enlighten me, because if they dont like it, then they shouldnt use our help then
@NorthEast_Wx @AMSweather goes to show you cant only rely on models. some climatology helps especially during tropical season
@TerpWeather @islivingston this business of not warning tornados is getting ridiculous now
@mitchellvii Hopefully Ohio, and Iowa as well. Maybe Minnesota, but I cant see Illinois flipping red. Hopefully we could reatain North Carolina-15 votes
@PattiLaudan I'm convinced it attributed to Trump's great win!
@PattiLaudan @POTUS I just hope people ignore the Fake News media lies that they spin about Trump
@PattiLaudan @POTUS I actually feel isolated here sometimes because barely ANYONE likes Trump here in NYC. I wish they could just see the good he is doing
@PattiLaudan @ScottPresler too*
@PattiLaudan @ScottPresler I wish we could turn NYC red once and for all. Seems to hard though
RT @snowwhite719: @ZackGianino @gardenerforever @ScottPresler True. For example https://t.co/lhj3KqT0H2
@iCyclone will you make it to Mexico in time for the second landfall?
@ScottPresler @EdWGillespie thanks for the info!
@ScottPresler @EdWGillespie who's vogel and adams?
@ScottPresler hey @ScottPresler are you voting for @EdWGillespie in November? I feel like his election is more important than what people think
@ZackGianino @ScottPresler I assure you that defeating ISIS, forcing NATO nations to pay up enforcing UN sanctions on North Korea does not give U.S. a "negative image"
@ZackGianino @ScottPresler No matter who is president, America's image is positive. That doesnt reflect who Trump fires from the White House, or how he isnt "typical"
@ZackGianino @ScottPresler I'll wait for those "crimes" to be proven before I stop supporting him
@ZackGianino @ScottPresler just because you support someone means you are a loyalist? Maybe its that we are see past the lying media and see how Trump helps people
@KWierso @ChuckGrassley i think those farmers will care
@kwilli1046 its the black thugs that are ruining the country. I see them all the time here in NYC. Disgusting
@SwissTechie @UPYOURS555 @Breaking911 @TrumpGirlStrong Whatever we have to do, if they want to go, we should let them
@iCyclone what was your highest recorded wind speed?
@mitchellvii what about florida or north carolina? combines they have 44 electoral votes

@UPYOURS555 @Breaking911 @TrumpGirlStrong same here. they like it so much, well, here's their opportunity!
@UPYOURS555 @Breaking911 @TrumpGirlStrong yep, him and liberals still think socialism is a good thing. They should go pay a visit then
@peacetiffini @JackPosobiec @Scott_Emge You might want to check your location then. If it says anywhere in the fifty states, then he IS your president, whether you like it or not
@FoxNews But socialism is great, right?
@iCyclone Why is it a lot of times, the observed winds are lower than what they say the wind speed is? Seems to happen more often than not
@pashonic @iCyclone dont those hotels lose power? or are their powerlines underground?
RT @RealJack: RETWEET if you believe H.R. McMaster needs to be fired ASAP. https://t.co/gqy9mDbkjU
@RobynGhost Maybe they shouldnt think we are jokes if they still want to receive the help that America gives them. Or they can just fend for themselves
@RobynGhost Whether he acts like one or not, he is still the president.
@RobynGhost Thats because he is in that position. Whether you want him to be in that position of not, he is the president
@iCyclone @EdMahmoud just giving credit where its due
@iCyclone @EdMahmoud Either way you do make pretty good videos. I might not like hurricanes, but seeing them in real-time allows me to see what others are seeing
@iCyclone @EdMahmoud Its always interesting to see things in someone else's perspective, such as seeing what they will go through in the aftermath
@iCyclone @EdMahmoud Yep. I'm just here to watch whatever footage you take. Occasionally, I get curious about other weather events around the globe
@iCyclone @EdMahmoud Hurricanes are a natural thing, its my opinion that they are awful. If my loved one was killed or my business was gone, I'd hate them
@iCyclone @EdMahmoud I think if you ask the people negatively affected by one, they'd say hurricanes are awful
@iCyclone @EdMahmoud ok, so dont type one then
@iCyclone @EdMahmoud I'm not saying tornados or hurricanes are "boring" or anything. But I was just curious how you can be fascinated by an awful thing.
@iCyclone @EdMahmoud Its a bit surprising to me, but to each his own
@iCyclone @EdMahmoud Alright. Same to you, have a nice day
@EdMahmoud @iCyclone I dont remember saying that, so I dont know where you read that. I was just curious why he likes chasing events that are so destructive
@iCyclone @EdMahmoud A heart surgeon is passionate about cardiology because he wants to help people. A mechanic is passionate because he wants to fix cars
@iCyclone @EdMahmoud so what do you like about cyclones then?
@iCyclone @EdMahmoud yeah, but these things cause damage though
@qafflea @ScottPresler Its the result of his "cut regulations and let businesses operate how they see fit" policy
@RobynGhost why is it unfortunate that you live in America? You should be happy
@RobynGhost I'm not trying to bully you. Even though I didnt like Obama, I never said, "Obama isnt my President." Cuz the fact of the matter is, he was
@RobynGhost Are you living in America? Because presidents only get 2 terms. So now, Trump is your President whether you like it or not
@ScottPresler And they say that Trump does nothing the whole day. When will they ever learn?
@mitchellvii Sounds like an economic win to me!

@AMSweather You could also watch it on https://t.co/36JXvqWRNh
@iCyclone @tornadokid3 Has the wind in these cyclones ever knocked you off your feet? I've seen that happen to reporters on the @weatherchannel
@JDT_71 @bakedalaska 15 dollars an hour would kill small businesses
@RSBNetwork dont they have chairs on the floor though? so what is the total seating capacity?
@BMcNoldy I'm not too ashamed. Who did you vote for @BMcNoldy Maybe you should be the ashamed one
@KeithCarson @lana_mccormick Good chat. Thanks for the info!
@rms5539 Its from wildifres though. What can the EPA do about wildfires?
@KeithCarson @lana_mccormick I'm not saying these scientists are idiots. And I am sure CO2 has an impact on environment but how is it enough to warrant all the hysteria?
@KeithCarson @lana_mccormick If everything takes a pattern of warming and cooling, why doesnt the cooling matter to any scientists? Shouldnt they recognize the pattern?
@KeithCarson @lana_mccormick How do they know how the temperatures thousands of years ago? And thse cooler dips could be just as important as the warming period
@KeithCarson @lana_mccormick And its completely ruled out that we wont have and cooler periods? Hard to tell for sure isnt it?
@KeithCarson @lana_mccormick But if my climate isnt changing, then whose is?
@KeithCarson @lana_mccormick I understand why we have seasons. So define climate for me. Isnt it long term weather?
@lana_mccormick @KeithCarson Yep. Ice age then a warm up. Then the little medieval ice age and then a warmup. on and on it goes
@KeithCarson @lana_mccormick I am aware humans spew CO2, because its necessary. BUt exactly how is our climate changing. I'm still getting blizzards and heat waves
@KeithCarson @lana_mccormick and weather is always changing throughout those seasons. Just how "climate change" features weather changes. My climate isnt changing in NYC
@Breaking911 Thanks Trump! Cue the Thanks Obama tweets
@lana_mccormick @KeithCarson and thats why we have the 4 seasons
@AndrewSiffert Its not going to get any better, thats for sure. And when record low temperatures arrive, they wont even be mentioned. Weather propoganda
@PayneAllynRoot @ScottPresler Never said that. Just pointing out how my father contributed positively AND spoke English.  As every immigrant should
@gina122963 @LustfulErmine @oliverdarcy @Cernovich Agreed. That's the end of it
@alienghic @TTrogdon @MaggieSkitty @netfreedom @capitalweather You mean the Everglades? It seems to me that it is hard to guage that if it floods every high tide
@defektesmosaik @dechaannelle @BreeNewsome I think in today's time, it isnt necessary.
@SheilaMehok @bobstrout @ScottPresler An accent is fine. You can tell an accent from no knowledge whatsoever
@SheilaMehok @bobstrout @ScottPresler There should be some knowledge. Otherwise, you cant (at least in todays time) do basic things without English. Insurance, medicine etc
@SheilaMehok @bobstrout @ScottPresler my grandfather came from Italy. He was a gardener, learned English from Irish workers. But I think now, knowing English helps the immigrant
@SheilaMehok @bobstrout @ScottPresler And thats great. My grandfather did the same, but I think in this world and this time, it is more beneficial for immigrants to know english
@bobstrout @ScottPresler sure did. we need more immigrants and citizens in this country with this mindset
@ScottPresler yep. My dad was an immigrant from Greece. Knew english ahead of time and was able to contribute to this country positively.
@AMSweather but when the ingredients aren't in place, they issue a watch, and then wonder, "why was there only 1 thunderstorm today?"
@alienghic @TTrogdon @MaggieSkitty @netfreedom @capitalweather I think in the future everyone will realize that nothing like a "doomed coastline" has happened
@proust1974 @Buekish @LindseyGrahamSC I think we will find out eventually the pros and cons. I cant see there being more cons than pros, but we will find out
@alienghic @TTrogdon @MaggieSkitty @netfreedom @capitalweather thats because developers are encroaching on the high ground now. when they encroached on lower land, rich people bought the same ground
@alienghic @TTrogdon @MaggieSkitty @netfreedom @capitalweather there are more recording sights now than there used to be
@alienghic @TTrogdon @MaggieSkitty @netfreedom @capitalweather also, there is more damage to be done. these flood events are guaged on the damage they cause, which as time goes on will obviously be more
@dechaannelle @BreeNewsome it should be that it is the best out of everyone. not a single group, but out of all applicants
@proust1974 @Buekish @LindseyGrahamSC Yep, if you cut immigration, that forces citizens to do those jobs, which emplyers would have to raise the wages for
@alienghic @TTrogdon @MaggieSkitty @netfreedom @capitalweather going back decades, I am sure you can find rainfall flooding events that are just as bad as the ones now, -if documented
@dechaannelle @BreeNewsome The focus should be to take the best of the best from applicnats as a whole. Not certain groups
@alienghic @TTrogdon @MaggieSkitty @netfreedom @capitalweather exactly. there have been just as many extreme events then, but we just know about more of the current ones due to internet etc
@DeplorableFact @B911Nature ah, I see. thank you
@B911Nature it had nothing to do with Tropical Storm Emily. It had to do with a frontal system
@dechaannelle @BreeNewsome But the focus of the Affirmative Action is to diversify campuses which means the focus isnt on accepting the best of the best.
@dechaannelle @BreeNewsome They are mean to diversify campuses.
@dechaannelle @BreeNewsome I'm aware. It has to do with taking in a certain number of minorities. But if they dont earn the credit, why should they be taken in
@Uh_Cloudy @LindseyGrahamSC I do live in US. Bayside, Queens, NY in fact
@alienghic @TTrogdon @MaggieSkitty @netfreedom @capitalweather so was hurricane agnes rainfall flooding in Pennsylavnia in 1972 a sign of global warming?
@Uh_Cloudy @LindseyGrahamSC Isnt it better than being homeless though?
@LindseyGrahamSC why dont you have people in your own state work in that field instead of having the opportunity taken away from them and given to immigrants
@DavidBernardTV @EricBlake12 Really? I didnt even know it was that high. I'm surprised there wasnt even more flooding
@4SeasonsComedy @thistallawkgirl Trump doesnt directly do the evaluation of immigrants and you know that.
@coenice @BigJoeBastardi and now that there arent any cyclones, the warm water can churn and churn and churn and heat up even more.
@4SeasonsComedy @thistallawkgirl I'm sure it is more beneficial to have those that come with skills than those that dont
@BigJoeBastardi yep. when there is an up, there is a down
@coenice @BigJoeBastardi Not abnormal. Upwelling from TCs causes cooler water and there havent been many TCs this year in Pacific, leading to warmer waters
@DavidBernardTV @EricBlake12 It was 5 inches in 1-2 hours. No matter whether it is high tide or not, it would flood
@thistallawkgirl you mean valuing skilled immigrants over unskilled ones If thats profiling then I'm all for it. Have something to contribute before you come
@TTrogdon @alienghic @MaggieSkitty @netfreedom @capitalweather Yep. Urban areas tend to get more flooding. Less vegetation to soak up all the water. NYC is the same way. Up to 1 inch in one hour=flooding
@alienghic @MaggieSkitty @netfreedom @TTrogdon @capitalweather https://t.co/b9JWtYlAU0		They should have alternative power sources for the pumps then
@TTrogdon @alienghic @MaggieSkitty @netfreedom @capitalweather it would if sea level rise was a thing. but rainfall flooding has always happened and will always happen
@TTrogdon @alienghic @MaggieSkitty @netfreedom @capitalweather exactly. this could have happened 30 years ago and there wouldnt be any climate change claims
@alienghic @MaggieSkitty @netfreedom @TTrogdon @capitalweather The pumps haven't been working well over the past few years, which is, interestingly the time attributed to the rise of "nuisance flooding"
@BreeNewsome how is it racism? college applications shouldnt be based on color of skin, but merit and grades
@JoJo__C @elmerjfudd2012 @ScottPresler funding is there. look up what was passed a week ago. You are correct, Mexico will pay when they realize they cant abuse America anymore.
@JoJo__C @elmerjfudd2012 @ScottPresler Ban is there, funding for the wall has been passed, all that needs to be done now is the repeal and replace of ACA
@elmerjfudd2012 @JoJo__C @ScottPresler eventually, they will realize that their "resist" chant isnt going to fly with the american people
@KeithCarson Also, who defines extreme anyways.
@JoJo__C @elmerjfudd2012 @ScottPresler Ok. Wait until next election. All these "russian bots" will hand you some tissues when a beloved democrat candidate of yours loses- again
@KeithCarson I disagree with the part that extreme weather events are happening more often, its just that there are more ways to hear about them now
@elmerjfudd2012 @JoJo__C @ScottPresler well I see it now. Thats for sure
@LustfulErmine @gina122963 @oliverdarcy @Cernovich but it also showed her winning the electoral college by winning most of the swing states. which once again, didnt happen
@KeithCarson maybe it would be easier to communicate a message on something that is real and proven, not a hoax that has been pushed since the 90s
@JoJo__C @elmerjfudd2012 @ScottPresler I'm not even a Russian bot. Just because I think keeping things civilized is the way to go on social media, does not mean I am a bot
@edwood_not @JoJo__C @elmerjfudd2012 @ScottPresler how do you know it didnt hurt Trump voters? dont they fill out absentee balots and dont they early vote?
@elmerjfudd2012 @JoJo__C @ScottPresler whats the need for both of you to argue? You cant have a respectful debate? Then both of you should stay off twitter.
@JoJo__C @elmerjfudd2012 @ScottPresler oh please. let me guess, voter intimidation? just an excuse for those who say their voice didnt matter in the election
@JoJo__C @elmerjfudd2012 @ScottPresler blocked votes? how were votes blocked?
@Conmanswat @JimCantore @chucktodd You think the Paris climate accord would stop a major hurricane from making landfall
@MaggieSkitty @alienghic @netfreedom @TTrogdon @capitalweather So why did the pumps fail yesterday? That led to the extreme flooding
@MaggieSkitty @alienghic @netfreedom @TTrogdon @capitalweather Maybe they should worry about fixing the pumps before they build streets on high ground level
@JohnMoralesNBC6 So then you can't blame climate change for the flooding, you would have to blame the malfunctioning pipage
@alienghic @MaggieSkitty @netfreedom @TTrogdon @capitalweather King tides can't increase because they are the highest of all tides. The number of tides don't increase so the King tides can't either
@BigJoeBastardi cue the climate change alarmists
@algore @aitruthfilm Hmm, why dont you look at the 1938 long island clipper, or the great galveston hurricane, or hurricane agnes flooding in pennsylvania
@ScottPresler @The_Trump_Train @immigrant4trump @mitchellvii @JackPosobiec @ScottPresler you need to run for office. Even in NYC I would support you no matter where you run for. Your work ethic is imppecible
@MaggieSkitty @netfreedom @TTrogdon @capitalweather Thats during the king tides, which natually are the highest of all high tides. King tides flood many places around the world
@netfreedom @TTrogdon @capitalweather Pretty much. Miami hasnt seem thunderstorms before? Is this Miami's first high tide?

@iCyclone @WXRISKCOM thanks!
@iCyclone @WXRISKCOM what about matthew?
@iCyclone @WXRISKCOM I remember it had a super low pressure
@iCyclone @WXRISKCOM Did you chase hurricane sandy
@WXRISKCOM @iCyclone where can I find that scale?
@iCyclone @WXRISKCOM Is there a pressure scale, like 990 mb might have winds of 75 mph or something like that?
@iCyclone @WXRISKCOM If you look at the pressure levels only, it's misleading. It also has to do with size of the storm. Pressure isnt an indicator of wind imo
@Snap_Politics @freddierom923 @james_shireman @SheriffClarke Thats not what @freddierom923 is debating. He is debating over certain terminology for illegal immigrants. You both agree on the punishment
@freddierom923 @Snap_Politics @james_shireman @SheriffClarke Amen. i couldnt say it better myself
@freddierom923 @Snap_Politics @james_shireman @SheriffClarke Very true. Thank you for keeping this debate civilized. I see too much hatred on Twitter these days over mere differences in thoughts
@beedoodlez @_Makada_ I havent found any of Trumps comments anti-semetic.
@freddierom923 @Snap_Politics @james_shireman @SheriffClarke I know you agree with that. But its the terminology that we differ on
@freddierom923 @Snap_Politics @james_shireman @SheriffClarke That term fits any heinous criminal. Status was never an issue with this. But you said the justice department doesnt use terms correctly.
@freddierom923 @Snap_Politics @james_shireman @SheriffClarke But the justice department doesnt call them "sub human", just @SheriffClarke calling this rapist sub-human. Does "illegal alien" not fit
@freddierom923 @Snap_Politics @james_shireman @SheriffClarke So what term should we associate with him?
@Snap_Politics @freddierom923 @james_shireman @SheriffClarke exactly. the term "sub human" is too good to describe him
@DebraAAdams2 @ZiaErica @SheriffClarke Well, if the homeless want to stay that way, it still means those jobs that the illegals take can be given to a citizen who needs it
@freddierom923 @james_shireman @SheriffClarke I didnt misread anything. @SheriffClarke is referring to the criminal illegal alien, not just any illegal immigrant
@DebraAAdams2 @ZiaErica @SheriffClarke Here in NYC, most eateries and landscapings have illegals working, jobs that the homeless people I see on the streets everyday could have.
@freddierom923 @james_shireman @SheriffClarke A sexual assaulter isnt sub-human. Thats an awful crime! What does it make him, a hero?
@LunaDavis2 @SenateGOP @FarmBureau @ZippyDuvall @WI_State_Farmer so what he just said is a lie? I think the farmers and ranchers would disagree
@ericfisher Hopefully we can keep that pattern right into winter
@Breaking911 lets see MSM report this
@Hi_IQ_Trump @MarioDB you think socialism works?
@crankywxguy thanks
@crankywxguy what name would we have legitimately been up to so far?
@Jeff68Anderson @RepSeanDuffy @POTUS @realDonaldTrump @GovWalker @SpeakerRyan Thats still something. I am sure if you ask those people, $9.20 is better than $0
@iCyclone well, thanks for the update!
@iCyclone I am assuming rainfall would be a big threat, right?
@JacoboEnMty @RepChrisCollins @SenatorOrtt @SenatorFunke @PLawrence134th @karlafboyce so whats the solution? less guns, so even LESS people can defend themselves if a bad guy with a gun attacks them?
@iCyclone Isnt most of Japan elevated so storm surge wouldnt be much of an issue?
@iCyclone dont most curve out to sea?
@RepSeanDuffy @POTUS @realDonaldTrump @GovWalker @SpeakerRyan lets see, how can liberals spin this into something negative
RT @StacyLStiles: Please RT if you want @POTUS to sign an Executive Order, which makes #ObamaCare the primary insurance coverage for every…
@iCyclone @weatherchannel was the number 1 seller? haiyan?
@Breaking911 Maybe if they didnt have such strict gun laws for law abiding citizens, this wouldnt be needed.
@MimiBayer2 @ST1100_Rider @RealJack Thats why she should make sure she watches the whole clip before going on a nonsensical rant
@MimiBayer2 @ST1100_Rider @RealJack She didnt make a mistake. She purposely only talked about a certain part of the clip
@Michele08299661 @Mikecdog @margotjd @JohnSmi23763588 @phoenix036 @jrfet2001 @FoxNews @JudgeJeanine @POTUS Oh I see the typo. My bad. No I didn't get left behind.
@Mikecdog @margotjd @JohnSmi23763588 @Michele08299661 @phoenix036 @jrfet2001 @FoxNews @JudgeJeanine @POTUS I know. They are fantasizing of Trump ending the world and how Trump supporters would praise him for it. What have these libearls come to?
@peedieskarf @FraserNelson What wrong with Trump? His personality? Look at his accomplishments, he's helping people
@PerryJuDo4ever @AMSweather @crankywxguy Exactly. Everyone makes mistakes, and in the end, slight changes in the forecasts dont have dire impacts. People need to learn to just "be"
@AMSweather @PerryJuDo4ever @crankywxguy Unfortunately, I see too many insulting arguments against one another on twitter. One of the downsides
@jcolman22 Any other years similar to this?
@AMSweather @crankywxguy Very lucky to have @crankywxguy  and @AMSweather  share their weather thoughts for free. One day it will come back to you guys don't worry
@Virgini29276846 @ScottPresler @realDonaldTrump Some states will always go blue
@ScottPresler But I thought his support is dissipating? More fake news lies
@fake_name99 @dhartmann23 @SenJohnMcCain Lately, I have actually found respect for Paul Ryan. He's trying to pass the agenda but it keeps getting stuck in the Senate
@crankywxguy Banding features remind me of mesoscale banding in blizzards
@HeerJeet Tell me, how was his speech vile? Can someone please tell me, I am genuinely curious.
@MansurGidfar @Scaramucci You mean brutally assault gang members? Go right ahead, they have no purpose on this planet
@CBSEveningNews Down with the leakers
@hystericalonion @washingtonpost There will always be major hurricane landfalls. They have happened in the past and will happen in the future. "Climate change" doesnt affect
@AMSweather Yet they dont point out that the Polar Vortex is technically always there and always makes an occurance every winter.
@JRubinBlogger Telling @lisamurkowski that she will be voted out is a threat? Typical political talk, women are politicians. Therefore, she's fair game
@AlyssaA1989 @washingtonpost you sound VERY open minded
@iCyclone @RobertMuirWood @RMS Are you planning on chasing the typhoon headed to Taiwan?
@crankywxguy where do you find these reports?
@VicSmith2011 @Libertarian181 @fifetoyi @richardrobot @GingerRogersUSA @DigiAnarchist @MarkDice I think he has been proven to be pretty conservative. Remember, people's views DO change
@Libertarian181 @VicSmith2011 @fifetoyi @richardrobot @GingerRogersUSA @DigiAnarchist @MarkDice Its true. Get government out and I believe it will be better overall
@StormFrontWX So why do they come here for major operations then?
@RepMullin @HouseGOP So now get Tax Reform done
@StormFrontWX But if you increase taxes, aren't we all paying for our healthcare in some way or another
@StormFrontWX How would 100% free health care for every legal American  citizen work? Who would pick up the bill?
@markellinwood What is? Trump's success as President?
@therealOrrinO @AmericaFirstPol Its better than them being unemployed, isnt it?
@VicSmith2011 @Libertarian181 @fifetoyi @richardrobot @GingerRogersUSA @DigiAnarchist @MarkDice And that failure is then carried to Washington
@gventre1 How did he threaten them?
@VicSmith2011 @Libertarian181 @fifetoyi @richardrobot @GingerRogersUSA @DigiAnarchist @MarkDice I say they need to create a replacement, and quickly. Repeal it once there is a replacement
@Libertarian181 @VicSmith2011 @fifetoyi @richardrobot @GingerRogersUSA @DigiAnarchist @MarkDice Whatever way they do it, repealing and replacing must be done. Its up to them at this point, no one can even point fingers at Trump.
@KaivanShroff Maybe we could do a #SuccesfulFriday Like job and GDP growth, new trade deals, and improving national security. Hey, that works too
@Libertarian181 @VicSmith2011 @fifetoyi @richardrobot @GingerRogersUSA @DigiAnarchist @MarkDice True, we should all work together to vote out those who dont want to get rid of ACA
@VicSmith2011 @Libertarian181 @fifetoyi @richardrobot @GingerRogersUSA @DigiAnarchist @MarkDice Yep, when you leave pieces of it, someone will STILL be getting hurt by it
@Libertarian181 @VicSmith2011 @fifetoyi @richardrobot @GingerRogersUSA @DigiAnarchist @MarkDice Repeal it now, focus on patient centered care, and then replace it in due time. Dont rush these things, thats how you get bad deals like ACA
@Libertarian181 @fifetoyi @richardrobot @GingerRogersUSA @DigiAnarchist @MarkDice You mean by supporting illegals? No thanks, americans first. You mean like supporting refugees? when they are the ones that commit terrorism
@ArjRay3 @Swimmingly_too @MarkDice Maybe you need to research on what a dictator is
@Libertarian181 @fifetoyi @richardrobot @GingerRogersUSA @DigiAnarchist @MarkDice Many people on the left and on the right are completely intolerant. Intolerance does not have a party
@JOMainEvent They dont want to report on @POTUS success thus far
@runningsub4 @ColumbiaBugle @realDonaldTrump What is wrong with coal jobs? They are still jobs that support people aren't they
@AMSweather Impossible. That's how you get to the "it busted" conclusion when people actually miss the main idea
@DCRobMan @realDonaldTrump Another poll: "What will Donald Trump accomplish tomorrow?" Answer choices: jobs, security, enerfy production Oh wait, he's already doing it
@DC_Resister_Bee @realDonaldTrump Or you could focus on the jobs announcement, or what he is doing for the police and veterans. But its ok, shout "Russia" and see Trump MAGA
@DynamiteWilly19 @Arletta0301 @Breaking911 I wouldn't be surprised
@JohnLariscy @ScottPresler Same with the coal miners and the frackers!
@tlmundy2 @UltraEmperor @JasonSarenIsMe @ScottPresler Liberals and conservatives both fight in their own way. As Americans we have to understand that government isn't oppressing them
@tlmundy2 @UltraEmperor @JasonSarenIsMe @ScottPresler Conservatives because they want minorities to work not to be spoiled
@ScottPresler My dad has had some doubts about Trump recently but once he saw the jobs announcement today, he knew Trump would keep his word
@ericfisher Reminds me of the January Blizard 2016 cutoff
@jparise858 @AmericaFirstPol I did see it in multiple places. I have seen 10,000 and 13,000. Yet to see 3,000. Regardless, it is safe to say it is beneficial to some
@crankywxguy seems like Delaware and south NJ will be the jackpot again
@jparise858 @AmericaFirstPol Its better than none though. And it was 13,000. Thats thousands more people employed and in the workforce.
@AmericaFirstPol I'm still waiting for a liberal to day this is bad in some way. I doubt I will have to wait long
@6rateful @PrisonPlanet They were judged before. It's not right to judge but the world isn't a perfect place
@judah47 Oh well. Can't win all the time
@judah47 so the longer this patter continues in summer, there would be the opposite in winter?
@Breaking911 Then THEY will be repealed and replaced in 2018
@6rateful @PrisonPlanet I'm sure it doesnt help them to be uncomfortable around those who arent trans and I'm certain they feel judged. Not everyone is as accepting
@6rateful @PrisonPlanet operations. All these things will just make our military a chaotic place
@6rateful @PrisonPlanet to have them mix with what they think they are, thats a different story. Plus the military has no place with funding "gender changing"...
@6rateful @PrisonPlanet Example: where to go the bathroom, what bunkers to sleep in, etc. It would be one thing if they lumped all the Transgenders together, but...
@6rateful @PrisonPlanet But they aren't REALLY that way. If you are born a girl you are one and same with a man. Then there would be confusion over simple things...
@6rateful @PrisonPlanet There's no time for confusion in the military. Know what you are, then you can join. Simple really.
@6rateful @PrisonPlanet then they can go right ahead and help themselves to it
@PrisonPlanet Plus now with Foxconn and Walmart investing in thousands of new jobs, it also shows his economic policy is on a roll
@beedoodlez @_Makada_ How were his comments anitsemetic
@ScottPresler @chrisgeidner funny how @chrisgeidner didnt respind to this
@AmericaFirstPol @WhiteHouse Anyone wants to say this is bad?
@BBackerman1 @RealJack @realDonaldTrump I disagree. If he told everyone to go to DC and March in support of him, there would be more of us
@BBackerman1 @RealJack @realDonaldTrump I believe it was Mobile, AL, which is as republican as DC is democrat
@HollyBuskirk1 @ScottPresler @VP @POTUS I think he is trying to keep his base strong by going to states that he won
@BBackerman1 @RealJack @realDonaldTrump he did have a 40,000 rally once.If you got most Trump supporters together in some cities, the crowds would outnumber the one you posted
@LouDobbs @POTUS Thank you @POTUS for speaking directly to the people
@RealJack @realDonaldTrump Must be about 7,000 people there. Must be, if not more. This movement will never slow down!
@HollyBuskirk1 @ScottPresler @VP @POTUS In the past 14 elections, the candidate that Ohio has voted for, has ended up winning. They are a Bellweather state

@AMSweather I heard Worcester broke a record today. If it was a heat record, it would have been reported everywhere
@realSaneTrump @ChuckCallesto @Cernovich @HillaryClinton If you could reply to me now, then you could have respnded to @ChuckCallesto tweet directed towards you
@ChuckCallesto @realSaneTrump @Cernovich @HillaryClinton Funny how there was no reply from @realSaneTrump after this list
@VP @POTUS Thank you! Its been long enough

@MissTree18 @lc65265 @RSBNetwork thank you
@RSBNetwork when does coverage begin?
@LindseyGrahamSC Even if she comitted a crime? A crime is a crime no matter who does it.
@lc65265 @RSBNetwork it says 2 P.M. central?
@realDonaldTrump They better side with the forgotten victims.
@JeffFortenberry which is why socialized medicine and single payer would be a disaster for this country
@lgsawyer @allthingsnerds @SenateMajLdr You think illegal immigration is fine? Or allowing Muslims into this country? They are the only ones who commit terrorism, why let them in?
@SportsRook @WhiteHouse It said right in the plan that it will cover pre existing conditions. And if you dont want to get pregnant, then dont fool around
@capitalweather @NWS_MountHolly There are clear problems with the @NWS_MountHolly warning system
@BigJoeBastardi Its interesting how they only exagerrate warm temperatures, never the cooler than average ones though
@ericfisher just how they say that when the temperatures are warmer than normal. Also paint warmer temperatures in a historic light, but not cold ones.
@ericfisher There have been quite a few of those cool days this spring and summer. I am just curious why they wont say "Breaking news: Cold summer day"
@ericfisher Maybe I am "that guy" who just speaks the truth.
@ericfisher Just voicing my opinion. Like you, like anyone else
@ericfisher No global warming claims today? Hmm, interesting
@Papa6611 @CaryLen @eligit @BeauWillimon you live in America? Then he IS your president.
@ktva what the hell is a cat doing being mayor? good lord
@nwsister2016 @NancyPelosi What is the evidence?
@RepAdamSchiff @POTUS How about you focus on governing, not "Russia hacked the election for Trump" which still cant be proven?
@mike_Zollo Yep. Illegals should not be part of this country. They bring no value, no skills. They just eat up your tax money and take our jobs
@ToscaAusten @vitoperulli1 @mitchellvii I hope they never realize how their policies are failing.And how their race baiting doesnt work. The electors should keep proving them wrong
@realDonaldTrump They will be VOTED OUT. Which is something they should comprehend very well
@BobbettaJane @SaraHolman14 @PressGop "Hillary helps 2 men up the stairs" 		"Trump gets 2 scoops of ice cream, everyone else gets 1"
@AMSweather what was the rating?
@AMSweather any damage?
@NWSMemphis I dont think 145 degrees is correct
@ShariFreeWill @magpiemoongrove @gayford03 @AdamT_Brown @ananavarro you really think he is going to start World War 3? Do you really think that? You really think he is going to "destroy the world"? Come on
@ananavarro Also, an Indian manufacturer coming to the United States. 4,000 new jobs. Vial companies producing in the United States, important stuff
@magpiemoongrove @gayford03 @ShariFreeWill @AdamT_Brown @ananavarro I'm American. I dont want him removed
@ananavarro he's not allowed to tweet. you're doing it right now. so why cant he?
@SiameseCitys @mitchellvii I said they are listening, not that they are changing. They hear and listen to the voices, what they do then determines next elections
@SiameseCitys @mitchellvii their opinions, and are listened to by other citizens and as you can tell, politicians more recently
@SiameseCitys @mitchellvii Time will tell. But I assure you, politicians are listening to those who feel fed up. Whether it is on the left or right, citizens voice
@SiameseCitys @mitchellvii The people of this country are listening to those who felt neglected by Obama. They voted, Trump won. Who knows if MAGA gained converts.
@SiameseCitys @mitchellvii Just because they are unhappy doesnt mean they are listening. If anything, they are listening more
@SiameseCitys @mitchellvii The country after recent elections
@mitchellvii And WE are always better than the media. WE are the real voice of this country
RT @dcmccumber: BREAKING: Chinese release Guthrie McLean, @SteveDaines says
@dcmccumber @SteveDaines Gee, I wonder who made that deal?
@Breaking911 shoot him on the spot
@TucciTellsIt @NMalliotakis The shouldnt be here in the first place. I shouldnt have to work just so they get the benefit
@Hakimyasin @GOPChairwoman @truthismaster @POTUS If its unattractive then they shouldnt come.My tax money shouldnt be wasted on them. Jail them, then ship them off back where they come from
@maklelan @HouseGOP @POTUS How do they target minorities? And all unions do is take money out of your paycheck for what?
@maklelan @HouseGOP @POTUS how do businesses opress poor people. they should be happy they have those jobs
@maklelan @HouseGOP @POTUS the more businesses make money, the better it is for the economy. when businesses werent making any money around '08 that also hurt economy
@maklelan @HouseGOP @POTUS cutting red tape and regulations allows more people to be hired for businesses and makes it that they can make more money
@Voicechyk @admiralmpj @KidRock Trump already signed off on millions of dollars going to rebuild their water pipes in the next few years
@mitchellvii Meanwhile all the Democrats do is blame everyone but their failed policies and their never changing notion of socialism
@cook_bubba @ScottPresler I'll take him any day over Ralph northam
@BieberAlanFan @realDonaldTrump I certainly don't. By "we" you don't speak for everyone
@ScottPresler That's just as impressive as Trump's results on the economy, and national security, immigration
@homohomo @WatchPresTrump @NathanOTIME @Scaramucci @POTUS so everyone who supports Trump is a russian troll? I guess I am one too then
@ChuckGrassley Exactly. Showing that they are more transparent than the Democrats
@EddieHenson14 @rwfjsf @Rampage95x2 @GovMikeHuckabee @JayneMachacek @POTUS So basically you don't like anyone from Arkansas. Way to go. Insult millions of people and a whole state
@SSNjl @PressSec @POTUS @realDonaldTrump I agree. He took hate from all sides but still put up with the media's garbage
@Timodc @Scaramucci maybe that's because muslims are the ones that commit terrorsit attacks
@SethAbramson so when you hire someone, you have to immediately give them the lowest position?
@NWSTucson @voidcomp thanks!
@voidcomp @NWSTucson its incorrect right?
@RealJack Manufacturers back, war on coal and fracking done, pipeline being built with thousands of workers. I say Trump's presidency is a success
@Galleryladyana @FoxNews @SenTedCruz Same to you.
@Galleryladyana @FoxNews @SenTedCruz Even if the rich get a tax cuts, it allows them to higher more people. Theory of trickle down economics
@Galleryladyana @FoxNews @SenTedCruz No. My family gets a tax cuts under this plan. And the rich get a tax cuts as well. And the poor. No slack here
@Galleryladyana @FoxNews @SenTedCruz But it also provides a tax cuts for middle and lower class. If everyone's taxes are cut that seems beneficial to me
@Galleryladyana @FoxNews @SenTedCruz But if it gives tax breaks to the middle class and even the lower class, how is it only the rich. Makes no sense
@Galleryladyana @FoxNews @SenTedCruz I have read it myself. How does it cater to his rich friends?
@funder Only one seems to work. Resisting. The rest- not so much
@adidasorange1 @capitalweather @Reinlwapo There are always climate swings. Some in the past have been more severe
@capitalweather @Reinlwapo Maybe because climate change still isnt proven
@BillCassidy Thank you Donald Trump. By opening up the markets with China, we can increase new wealth!

@wectnews @spann Doesn't that make it a tornado
@bluegreenrains @CBSNews @Anaridis They have been wrong before just like the weather channel. But I check the weather out of necessity. I don't trust CBO anymore
@bluegreenrains @CBSNews @Anaridis I know they aren't the most reliable
@bluegreenrains @CBSNews @Anaridis No. I go onto the weather channel
@CBSNews @Anaridis CBO isn't the most reliable. Wrong about ACA wrong about this
@bkpage @NILC_org I should have put a question mark next to the "good for economy" part
@bkpage @NILC_org If you get rid of the illegals then the economy will boom. Jobs for many
@bkpage @NILC_org I am sure there is someone out there that could have the jobs that those illegals have
@NILC_org good for the economy. they take jobs that homeless americans can have.
@orrchards UNdocumented immigrants. Meaning they should NOT be here

@SBGC2C @RepLaHood @KHQA exactly why we need Trump to renegotiate NAFTA
@billoreilly I say no repeal unless there is a replacement. Thats what WE asked for and thats what WE should get. BCRA is better than ACA.
@WayneDupreeShow I hop the Rock runs and beats her and then Trump beats the Rock
@Morty_Fied @CriticalMessUS @ScottPresler Obama's failure and a new start with Trump
@RealJack But in order to have real change, we need the GOP to get real. And that means replacing those that wont over the next year or so
@NMalliotakis I'm with you @NMalliotakis and so are the other 4 in my family
@SteelmanKeith @TXRandy14 But it is a reflection of the nation overall. Texas is in America and everyone in America has the same needs
@Therealrewrew @RepRichHudson isnt it cheaper to pay the fee
@ChadTheCoolcat @Realjmannarino But there is the environment now and I am convinced there always will be. If you ask those people, they are happy to be put to work
@iamjazzergal @ScottPresler Most of America is and they are seeing past the fake news lies
@ChadTheCoolcat @Realjmannarino ...there will be a huge environmental impact because of it. People depend on such jobs and they cant come off of it
@ChadTheCoolcat @Realjmannarino I dont think scienitists are fake news. Otherwise they would be scientists. But you cant scrap thousands of jobs because you feel that...
@iamjazzergal @ScottPresler They realized the democrats weren't being productive and looked at Trump's productive record as President thus far
@iamjazzergal @ScottPresler and then Trump's @AmericaFirstPol will advance quickly
@ChadTheCoolcat @Realjmannarino My head is out of the sand and has listened to those who have benefitted over this past 6 months. I would advise you do the same
@ChadTheCoolcat @Realjmannarino The answer isnt to fire them Its to keep them working, and push for solar and wind projects elsewhere. If we have coal, might as well use it
@LizzyBB10 @ScottPresler Most of their friends live in Republican areas of Queens so that shouldn't be hard
@tadgher99 @ScottPresler And with the results we are seeing, we will be looking at president Trump until 2024
@mbwaldo @ScottPresler Hopefully NY can vote out Kirsten Gillibrand in 2018
@Hrod1730 @ScottPresler There is always hope. Especially when it comes to a movement directed by @POTUS based on results
@ScottPresler And even though my sisters are democrat, they voted for Trump in November and are still proud of it to this day
@ScottPresler My parents in Queens, NY just switched over from Democrat to Republican yesterday
@ChadTheCoolcat @Realjmannarino I dont only get my news from a biased news source. But if you get yours from CNN or MSNBC, like the ones conducting the polls, are also bias
@ChadTheCoolcat @Realjmannarino It'll benefit the people there when gas prices are lower because the gas transfer process is easier here at home
@ChadTheCoolcat @Realjmannarino But people need those jobs to support themselves and their families. You cant just take them away
@Drjoptapus If what you say is true, then I do believe there should be reform in Oklahoma. Sorry I misunderstood the first time
@Drjoptapus I am all for mercy when it comes to self-defense, vigilante stuff. But if you know what's going to happen then you are only hurting yourself
@Drjoptapus then they shouldnt do the crime then. They know very well what will happen before they commit it
@ChadTheCoolcat @Realjmannarino push for a petroleum pipeline running from America to Mexico 	Industrial production is up 4.7% and manufacturing is highest in years
@ChadTheCoolcat @Realjmannarino America will become a top 10 oil exporter by 2020, and the Kestone XL and Dakota Pipelines will help push this along. Not to mention his...
@ChadTheCoolcat @Realjmannarino He helped pass Kate's Law and No Sanctuary for Criminals Act, and put an end to catch-and-release which killed American lives
@ChadTheCoolcat @Realjmannarino Plus, withdrew from TPP and the Paris Climate Accord which was just a slush fund. He also made deals with manufacturers to prevent outsource
@ChadTheCoolcat @Realjmannarino 45,000 new coal mining jobs, rolled back regulations on fracking. Signed the VA Accountability bill which should have been done a while back
@EricHolthaus More wildfires could be a result of more thunderstorms. Lightning sparks these fires, and fires create their own weather and more fires
@ChadTheCoolcat @Realjmannarino His candidacy. Not his presidency. His presidency has benefitted those who felt unforgotten and he is getting rid of things that hurt people
@mitchellvii it should be 45% republican, 45% democrat, and 10% independent/undecided
@GovMaryFallin dont do the crime if you cant do the time
@ChadTheCoolcat @Realjmannarino If the results of Trump's presidency are positive and helping people, then how is it "bad leadership"
@Drjoptapus I do. Is that a problem?
@ChadTheCoolcat @Realjmannarino The only reason I think they are flubbed is because of D+10 or more samples
@GovMaryFallin if women commit a crime, they deserve to be in jail just like men
@ChadTheCoolcat @Realjmannarino I wouldnt want him in jail. There is no need for a president to go to jail over allegations that still dont prove, "Russia changed votes"
@ChadTheCoolcat @Realjmannarino But people see the proof of a good job Trump is doing, while there is no proof that Russia hacked the election for Trump
@VET55USA @billoreilly But some people didnt want healthcare either way. They paid the fines. So why burden the middle class for something people dont want?
@billoreilly I agree. If the BHCRA didnt make the cut, scrap it and start over. At least show you are trying!
@sophiesmom1018 @mitchellvii Erase state lines, create more competition
@mitchellvii I think this will only be so if there is a plan in place to replace ACA. If not, then the Democrats will take hold
@ChadTheCoolcat @Realjmannarino We dont. But I think the polls are misjudging the amount of people who like and dislike him
@mitchellvii Repealing ACA now and replacing later is not a good idea. Scrap the BHCRA if there isnt enough support and come up with a new plan, soon!
@lynn_kau @JessicaResist @RepMarkMeadows I agree. Middle class shouldn't get shafted by those uninterested in health insurance
@pjj16 @LindseyGrahamSC I hope so. I say pass it and then tweak it. Otherwise "thinking" does no good. Acting will
@pjj16 @LindseyGrahamSC Knowing him, it will just be excuses, not any clear plan
@LindseyGrahamSC and what might your approach be? its now or never and 2018 isnt too far off
@JessicaResist @RepMarkMeadows 6.5 million Americans didnt want ACA in 2016. It seems to be they were unsatisifed before ACA, now with the ACA and in the future with BHCRA
@JessicaResist @RepMarkMeadows If they dont want "garbage insurance" which is exactly what the ACA was, then if no insurance at all suits them, then by all means go ahead
@JessicaResist @RepMarkMeadows People on ACA can choose a plan with this BHRCA. If they are given the choice to choose a plan or to leave, then they arent being thrown off
@AlphaLimaLima @SenBobCorker @StateDept So who's controlling
@AlphaLimaLima @SenBobCorker @StateDept So what would you call unrest and no government
@AlphaLimaLima @SenBobCorker @StateDept But our government keeps things in control. No anarchy, no civil unrest, and fair opportunity for everone
@AlphaLimaLima @SenBobCorker @StateDept not everyone is fortunate. it cant always be every man for themself. sometimes you need help
@AlphaLimaLima @SenBobCorker @StateDept but when it comes down to business,the U.S. government helps its own people and people abroad.figure that for the most overrated governement
@RWPUSA so where was there election made?
@AFeldman2 @climatehawk1 If no one told you about global warming, would everyone say they feel a difference
@climatehawk1 @AFeldman2 but they only look at temperature over the past several decades. the thirties were much warmer, and the earth has been around for billions
@RepGraceMeng @DHSgov @ICEgov It was FOR a troop raise*
@RepGraceMeng @DHSgov @ICEgov why did you vote no against a raise for troops last week?
@AFeldman2 @climatehawk1 That has been for the last 6 years. There are always ups and downs depending on solar activity, more active tropics etc.
@AFeldman2 @climatehawk1 Yeah I know but there have been temperatures so similar to the ones being seen now for decades, and probably even hundreds of years ago
@AFeldman2 @climatehawk1 How are there more days with high heat?
@climatehawk1 Its been 120 degrees in Arizona and California before. It reaches 110s every year, so how is it global warming when it happens now
@tjobykh @ScottPresler @hellofromtiff @realDonaldTrump How so?
@LeeCahoon3 @BBaker916 @RepGraceMeng and then hopefully we will find a candidate that truly cares!
@DaysLeft4Trump @realDonaldTrump @USGA until his second term
@realDonaldTrump @USGA Basically a wrap-up of your election. Hopefully that amateur wins, that would be interesting
@BBaker916 @LeeCahoon3 @RepGraceMeng yep but it would help if truly supportive politicians can be elected
@BBaker916 very true. I just wish more people around me had that notion when it comes to unseating democrat politicians who haven't helped us
@JuddLegum People complain about people being thrown off health insurance with this plan but you aren't thrown off if you choose not to have it
@tplskylrk @NoNoNotNormal @Papa6611 @washingtonpost Count me in as part of the cult then. I approve, so I guess I am the "cult."
@LeeCahoon3 @BBaker916 @RepGraceMeng Just imagine it as the hardest door to open everyone needs to help
@LeeCahoon3 @BBaker916 @RepGraceMeng I don't see a future for Republican politicians in NYC
@LeeCahoon3 @BBaker916 @RepGraceMeng The bad thing is in New York governors have unlimited term number
@LeeCahoon3 @BBaker916 @RepGraceMeng Cuomo isn't too productive either
@LeeCahoon3 @BBaker916 @RepGraceMeng I think a good start would be to unseat de blasio and then get rid of Cuomo in 2018. Then let the districts flip Republican
@LeeCahoon3 @BBaker916 @RepGraceMeng Occasionally you meet some people in the grocery stores who have similar views but most don't voice now. But that better change
@LeeCahoon3 @BBaker916 @RepGraceMeng Much thanks
@davitydave @WhiteHouse That's the worst argument I have ever heard
@davitydave @WhiteHouse So whats going to happen to Pittsburgh and Paris. Thery are going to dissapear?
@BBaker916 @RepGraceMeng I think he may be voted out this year but when it comes to congressman, their just don't seem to be enough Republicans left
@BBaker916 Thank you. I wish we could unseat @RepGraceMeng here in NYC but the chances are fairly low
@BBaker916 I think those in the twin cities need some more convincing
@ReginaOlmstead1 @BearingArmsCom @TLBatten @NRA It doesnt matter what party you are. Guns are already out there. If you dont allow good guys to get guns, the bad guys will run rampant
@BBaker916 do you think Trump can win Minnesota in 2020?
@ReginaOlmstead1 @BearingArmsCom @TLBatten @NRA how so? validate your argument
@ReginaOlmstead1 @BearingArmsCom @TLBatten @NRA there is nothing wrong with defending yourself. bad guys have guns, only good guys can stop them. simple as that.
@ReginaOlmstead1 @BearingArmsCom @TLBatten @NRA and your view isnt "single minded"
@ReginaOlmstead1 @BearingArmsCom @TLBatten @NRA If they had that notion, everyone in this country would be dead
@nynjpaweather Same here in Queens. High of 69 instead of 76
@nynjpaweather they will die off before they reach NYC right?
@ReginaOlmstead1 @BearingArmsCom @TLBatten @NRA How are 2nd amendment supporters "a sad group of ISIS like hypocrites"

@MollyJongFast @WhiteHouse How would that solve the health care problem?
@mkmanansala @mitchellvii @DonaldJTrumpJr But he didnt get anything. He might have conspired, sure, but if it didnt help Trump and it didnt help Hillary then there was no harm done
@mkmanansala @mitchellvii @DonaldJTrumpJr key thing is "if." No one really knows went down in that meeting except for him. Don Jr's claim is that he learned nothing, so no soliciting
@mkmanansala @mitchellvii @DonaldJTrumpJr how could be a violation of finance law if there was no money involved? "ideas" are not money
@mkmanansala @mitchellvii @DonaldJTrumpJr Can't violate finance law if no donations were made
@mitchellvii Simple as that. 11/6/18, here we come!
@scks386 @KeithMcC29 @ScottPresler @CarolGarofolo @ThaJakeperson @bpt326 @ABC @lsarsour Very true. And many people who dont have common sense went through college. Education doesnt always match morals and common sense

@jessels46 @kw1979 @anbtruth @BYankee0103 @Cruzlovesmovies @mattbelknap @GovMikeHuckabee Liberals have no evidence of crimes commited by Trump, so they resort to name calling. Its a shame we came to this

@nullnotvoid @bamaroll14 @bk2731 @TomiLahren @POTUS The Electoral College is how you win. She knew that. Campaign more in key areas instead of reaching out for ONLY more votes in liberal areas
@enemytrump @RealEstate4SoMD @Ms_Addertongue @jrsmits @WalczakLinda9 @nytimes I bet they'll come up cold
@enemytrump @RealEstate4SoMD @Ms_Addertongue @jrsmits @WalczakLinda9 @nytimes I dont doubt the corrupt. But I dont know about illegal. If it was illegal then I think the FBI, DOJ would have closed the case already
@enemytrump @RealEstate4SoMD @Ms_Addertongue @jrsmits @WalczakLinda9 @nytimes I am aware that Trump has business ties to Russia. Everyone knows that. But I doubt it will put Russia first before our allies
@enemytrump @RealEstate4SoMD @Ms_Addertongue @jrsmits @WalczakLinda9 @nytimes I doubt it. He just wants to form a friendship with Russia. Allies are better than enemies
@Revenant_Media @AmeriKimPatriot @LuigiValentino @DonaldJTrumpJr Oh man. You really busted me this time
@enemytrump @RealEstate4SoMD @Ms_Addertongue @jrsmits @WalczakLinda9 @nytimes I think if we team up with the best hackers in the world in hopes to stop the spread of hacking, it would be fine. But I wouldnt trust Putin
@enemytrump @RealEstate4SoMD @Ms_Addertongue @jrsmits @WalczakLinda9 @nytimes Slogans are in every campaign. It is what's behind the slogans that matters
@enemytrump @RealEstate4SoMD @Ms_Addertongue @jrsmits @WalczakLinda9 @nytimes I know Obama helped us through the recession. But with Trump's policies, we can now get the economy rolling again. Not just a kickstart
@RealEstate4SoMD @enemytrump @Ms_Addertongue @jrsmits @WalczakLinda9 @nytimes Yep. There are enough jobless people in this country to fill those job opportunities in new energy fields without getting rid of coal miners
@enemytrump @RealEstate4SoMD @Ms_Addertongue @jrsmits @WalczakLinda9 @nytimes But when it came to healthcare, they whined. If they had a genuine bill by the time Trump took office, that would have saved the pain now
@RealEstate4SoMD @enemytrump @Ms_Addertongue @jrsmits @WalczakLinda9 @nytimes Yep. Enthusiasm at record highs
@enemytrump @RealEstate4SoMD @Ms_Addertongue @jrsmits @WalczakLinda9 @nytimes From both sides. Republicans did this under Obama and now the Democrats are doing this under Trump.
@enemytrump @RealEstate4SoMD @Ms_Addertongue @jrsmits @WalczakLinda9 @nytimes Its like the English parliament. They are too busy arguing over which Party is better instead of focusing on the citizens that need help
@enemytrump @RealEstate4SoMD @Ms_Addertongue @jrsmits @WalczakLinda9 @nytimes I am Russian? No, I am not
@RealEstate4SoMD @enemytrump @Ms_Addertongue @jrsmits @WalczakLinda9 @nytimes And then when they choose not to, it is said to be "throwing them off." Will is different than being forced
@enemytrump @RealEstate4SoMD @Ms_Addertongue @jrsmits @WalczakLinda9 @nytimes We have enough coal to last us 250 years. Why not use it?
@enemytrump @RealEstate4SoMD @Ms_Addertongue @jrsmits @WalczakLinda9 @nytimes But I am sure the Mexican president knows a good deal when he hears it. And you cant just fire everyone in the coal industry.
@enemytrump @RealEstate4SoMD @Ms_Addertongue @jrsmits @WalczakLinda9 @nytimes The policies to keep coal mines open, and oil companies open in the Plains and in the Gulf of Mexico. Petroleum shipments to Mexico
@RealEstate4SoMD @enemytrump @Ms_Addertongue @jrsmits @WalczakLinda9 @nytimes Just like Trump said, "With HRC as president, it would be more of the same, or even worse."
@enemytrump @RealEstate4SoMD @Ms_Addertongue @jrsmits @WalczakLinda9 @nytimes And Trump's energy policies can help the economy grow
@enemytrump @RealEstate4SoMD @Ms_Addertongue @jrsmits @WalczakLinda9 @nytimes Really? Thats a new accusation. None proven true
@RealEstate4SoMD @enemytrump @Ms_Addertongue @jrsmits @WalczakLinda9 @nytimes We need budget prioritizing

@RealEstate4SoMD @enemytrump @Ms_Addertongue @jrsmits @WalczakLinda9 @nytimes Give power to the states! Its what the founding fathers wanted. Lets make them proud!
@RealEstate4SoMD @enemytrump @Ms_Addertongue @jrsmits @WalczakLinda9 @nytimes I belive Trump knows what to do. As President, I trust him to put America first. He is living up to it, thats for sure

@enemytrump @RealEstate4SoMD @Ms_Addertongue @jrsmits @WalczakLinda9 @nytimes America will always seem like a world power, it is time we take care of our priorities first. Lead America well, and the world will notice
@enemytrump @RealEstate4SoMD @Ms_Addertongue @jrsmits @WalczakLinda9 @nytimes How is the U.S. weaker on the global stage
@RealEstate4SoMD @enemytrump @Ms_Addertongue @jrsmits @WalczakLinda9 @nytimes He has asserted himself on the world stage, we saw that with the MOAB, the defeat of ISIS, and the missles sent to Syria
@enemytrump @RealEstate4SoMD @Ms_Addertongue @jrsmits @WalczakLinda9 @nytimes Trump didnt run on Putin's agenda. He ran on the one that the swing states wanted the most
@enemytrump @RealEstate4SoMD @Ms_Addertongue @jrsmits @WalczakLinda9 @nytimes So you think Putin planted trump
@DoubleStraps Trump is saying it for the better of western civilization. You see what the refugee crisis is doing to Europe.
@RealEstate4SoMD @enemytrump @Ms_Addertongue @jrsmits @WalczakLinda9 @nytimes In my opinion, Planned Parenthood and such should only receive private donations. Not funding from the states or the federal government

@enemytrump @RealEstate4SoMD @Ms_Addertongue @jrsmits @WalczakLinda9 @nytimes I dont even watch Fox news. They are just as biased as CNN.
@enemytrump @RealEstate4SoMD @Ms_Addertongue @jrsmits @WalczakLinda9 @nytimes You never answered my question
@enemytrump @RealEstate4SoMD @Ms_Addertongue @jrsmits @WalczakLinda9 @nytimes How is he working for Putin?
@RealEstate4SoMD @enemytrump @Ms_Addertongue @jrsmits @WalczakLinda9 @nytimes I think the biggest topic up for debate is aborton, still to this date. That seems to be what determines your party. Abortion and guns
@RealEstate4SoMD @enemytrump @Ms_Addertongue @jrsmits @WalczakLinda9 @nytimes I dont think they intentionally want to do harm, except for rioters and Antifa, I think they just dont realize what they propose hurts U.S.A
@RealEstate4SoMD @enemytrump @Ms_Addertongue @jrsmits @WalczakLinda9 @nytimes That is what I and every other sane person hopes for

@momsy01 @Ms_Addertongue @jrsmits @WalczakLinda9 @nytimes I guess thats why so many people voted for @HillaryClinton

@galtjon66 @Ms_Addertongue @jrsmits @WalczakLinda9 @nytimes The best part is that it just contributes to their losses in past elections, and in the future

@clowntrumpy @Harlan @DonaldJTrumpJr Get busy for the next 8 years so you dont think about it so much
@mehdirhasan The thing is that it was done under the Trump Administration. Trump CAN take credit because he finished Obama's job.
@USMC_DD Really? Because it seems to me that the USA sent so many airstrikes from above to help the Iraqis. They couldnt win this alone
@nullnotvoid @bk2731 @TomiLahren @POTUS I doubt thats what he meant. Plus, everyone knew ahead of time the Electoral College is our election policy. That means he did WIN FAIRLY
@dca40b4d76c54a0 @DaysLeft4Trump @realDonaldTrump alright. We will find out in a few years
@nullnotvoid @bk2731 @TomiLahren @POTUS Last I checked, he is the President of Russia, and Trump is the president of America, elected fair and square by the people
@dca40b4d76c54a0 @DaysLeft4Trump @realDonaldTrump if he continues to push his agenda and get things done, like he has already done, winning the re-election will be much easier
@catchtheliars @danjperlman @realDonaldTrump he was elected by fairly. how does that make him a fake president? I am genuinely curious

@stayh_kdebby @bfraser747 @PeeSparkle true, just like what they did with Dinkens, who was the worst mayor of NYC, and not surprisingly, he endorsed de Blasio this time around

@rkbulusu @PreetBharara what I am trying to get at is that if Canadians were illegally immigrating at the rate that Mexicans are, it would become a problem for U.S.
@WBBJ7TomMeiners @NWSMemphis @sonicdrivein Straight line winds or a tornado?
@AmericanBrony @Gallegos___ I would like to see a state like Connecticut or Oregon to go for Trump. They aren't TOO far to the left
@PreetBharara whats wrong with building the wall? why should we want illegals in America? Last I checked this isnt the United States of Mexico
@AmericanBrony @Gallegos___ I honestly think if the wall is in the process of being built, Trump could even win New Mexico

@say_bowers @CTM_3 @capitalweather yes it does. theories lead to discoveries. that is what happened with "climate change"/ "global warming". Did they even make up their mind?
@say_bowers @CTM_3 @capitalweather I believe the climate has always been changing you don't need science to prove it. That is what we have the 4 seasons for

@TSimpson_WREG3 @NWSMemphis was that a tornado or something else?
@TheZenofWriting @SenateGOP Sure about that?
@superboring1234 @dawnbozarth001 @SenateGOP yes that is what I meant. and it shouldnt matter if I dont have that many followers or a picture of myself. my OPINION is what matters here
@superboring1234 @SenateGOP can you show me where it says that? i must have missed it
@PseudonymousRex @SenateGOP I dont need to listen to an analysis of it, I can read it myself and make a deduction from it.
@dawnbozarth001 @superboring1234 @SenateGOP So anyone who agrees with you is a bot? Makes sense
@wunderground I think most tropical storms, no matter the month, are memorable for flooding
@PseudonymousRex @SenateGOP it doesnt cut health care for the poor, it just gives states power to fund as they see fit and the hopes of lowering taxes for everyone
@superboring1234 @SenateGOP pre-existing conditions will be covered. it says it in there
@PseudonymousRex @SenateGOP it isnt cutting medicaid, it is just stripping some federal funding and leaving it up to the states to determine how much $ should be used
@PseudonymousRex @SenateGOP "savagely cutting Medicaid" how so? what did I miss?
@superboring1234 @SenateGOP thats becuase everyone interprets that in their own way using the bias media. But I read the whole healthcare plan outline and it seems fine
@LeifHanson7 @SpeakerRyan @GOP how so? I am legitimately curious
@wunderground so you are saying that houston has never flooded before? very accurate, no doubt
@LeifHanson7 @SpeakerRyan then why even bother to look at what he posts?
@wxrjm it is a tornado now
@AlabamaEMA from a tornado?
@OutlawAngie @mitchellvii hopefully, a republican can win the gubernatorial election in Virginia this year
@OutlawAngie @mitchellvii either way, we are still winning!
@OutlawAngie @mitchellvii I dont think so.

@RealJack I am sure the movement is as strong as ever
@AMSweather @POTUS this is a huge slap in the face to the media and anyone who believes he hasnt done jack
@mitchellvii no, they should keep it up. More winning for America this way

@AMSweather its fine
@AMSweather what is orh?
@KETV @OfcVest looks at least ef 2 damage to me
@KETV @LaurenWeide i honestly doubt straight line winds would destroy a house built like this. Probably a tornado of some sort

@SheaDiamond @PressSec @POTUS is there something wrong with that?
@gabrielquotes @RobertsonHerman @KellyannePolls At this point, I dont think gun control would help, but border control is necessary at this point
@TheReelGeek @gabrielquotes @RobertsonHerman @KellyannePolls has gun ownership ever been legal in the U.K.

@wildweatherdan @DrShepherd2013 Those coal miners still matter though. They need money too
@crankywxguy please tell me where you found this
@DrShepherd2013 yeah, and you tell me, what would happen to the coal miners put out of work in West Virginia. You cant leave them out
@AMSweather even the ones that dont kill cause damage. Those who long to chase tornados wouldnt like it if one destroyed their house
@AMSweather same
@AMSweather no global warming shouts today, but once it reaches one degree above average... Global warming doesnt pick and choose when it would happen
@TornadoTitans do you know where I can find the tornado count so far for this year?
@TornadoTitans what time was it
@AMSweather but when it is warmer, they will cry global warming. Where are those cries now?

@VWeatherWatcher @PennsylvaniaPro @poconoproblems it's next to scranton
@nynjpaweather @weatherwilly The NAM got it right again. I think forecasters need to start using it more often. Sometimes outliers win
@nynjpaweather @weatherwilly not too little snow in NYC. Storm total of 6-10 inches
@mrlbem @nynjpaweather @hoffmanrich @AccuRayno Same here in queens
@weatherwilly basically NYC had 4-8 inches
@weatherwilly true, thanks for working so hard though. I am sure this was difficult to forecast
@weatherwilly I know you forecasters worked hard on the storm, but you know that most people will see this as a massive bust.
@weatherwilly would it be snow or sleet for nyc
@nynjpaweather Will we get any in nyc
@weatherwilly @VWeatherWatcher alright. I will keep watching it
@weatherwilly @VWeatherWatcher will it affect queens ny
@VWeatherWatcher snow and sleet in queens ny
@nynjpaweather mixing with snow here in bayside queens
@nymetrowx will it snow this afternoon in nyc?
@TheKidFromBKLYN @nynjpaweather oh. I just assumed you were in brooklyn
@cowens727 @nynjpaweather @NWSNewYorkNY I can confirm this
@TheKidFromBKLYN @nynjpaweather Here in queens the sleet is giving way to snow
@weatherwilly @nynjpaweather Now almost all snow here in northern queens. I would not be surprised if blizzard conditions verified today
@AMSweather and that one in early january too
@nynjpaweather changeover to snow in queens?
@weatherwilly what time do you think the snow will arrive
@weatherwilly this snow will head toward nyc in the afternoon right
@afreedma @DrShepherd2013 I went out before, it was very brutal. Snow, sleet, and wind= face pain
@nynjpaweather what about when it will change over in nyc
@nynjpaweather Intense snowfall in queens right now. Any thoughts on the cancellation of the blizzard warning
@nynjpaweather very interesting how the nws cancelled NYC's blizzard warning andreplaced it with winter weather advisory.could be a bad call
@nynjpaweather yep. I'd say we only missed about an hour of snow in queens
@weatherwilly @nynjpaweather All snow now in bayside, queens. Fat flakes and the wind is picking up
@HereIState @weatherwilly mix of sleet and snow here in queens, but expect a full changeover to snow soon
@nynjpaweather you are doing a fine job here for northern Queens. Now back to all snow
@weatherwilly I know. This storm won't pull away until 6 or 7 tonight
@weatherwilly Honestly, the brief sleet didn't change much of the storm impact for us. Now all snow, and will soon become heavy. Wind picking up
@weatherwilly Snowing back in Queens. Sleet just turned to snow
@ReedTimmerAccu @breakingweather Where are you located
@weatherwilly Definitely. Strong winds plus heavy wet snow equals power outages
@weatherwilly They really will be howling in nyc
@AMSweather Have fun and thanks for all you do
@JimCantore the snow and wind is getting stronger in nyc
@AlexWeather_NE When would this happen
@AlexWeather_NE Do you think it will occur
@AlexWeather_NE What are your thoughts on dynamic cooling for tomorrow
@michaeld021 new GFS shows 16 inches plus for NYC. Thumping snowfall and wind for the morning/ early afternoon
@michaeld021 new 2z hrrr shows 16-20 inches for nyc
@ESPNFC completely awful
@nynjpaweather Do you think that the storm is coming in quicker?
@ReedTimmerAccu stay safe and have fun
@spann That shows 14-20 inches for NYC by 2 P.M. The storm won't end until the evening
@crankywxguy what does this mean?
@stormtracker123 @nynjpaweather I personallly dont. Dynamic cooling could occur and make it that we stay as all snow
@RyanMaue This shows 14-18 for nyc. And this is only until noon. The snow won't stop until 7 P.M. Witnessing history!
@JimCantore That means almost all snow for NYC, some mixing possible, but not before intense snow and ends as snow as well

@ericfisher Bulls eye here in Queens then
@weatherwilly Didn't you add NYC into the 12-18 plus
@Jeepin74 @RyanMaue Mainly snow but some mixing in eastern suffolk
@weatherwilly This would include NYC right?
@WxSne @EdValleeWx Yes, considering they are right on the freezing line
@weatherwilly it shows up to 2 feet of snow in nyc
@AMSweather there were some record reports released by the NWS in gray
@nynjpaweather thanks
@AMSweather @CTforecasting It must be because they are so confident. Same thing happened during the groundhog day blizzard in chicago 2011

@crankywxguy what is qpf?
@AMSweather @crankywxguy What is your opinion on the weather channel naming winter storms?
@weatherchannel Heavy sleet falling in bayside queens right now. Streets and cars are icing over
@AMSweather I wish we could get a storm like that down here in NYC
@AMSweather areas nearby reached official blizzard criteria, so maybe same for your area @NWSBoston might have already reached the verdict
@NWSNewYorkNY @nynjpaweather A storm total of about 12 inches here in bayside queens. It has officially stopped snowing
@nynjpaweather most snowfall totals here in nyc are already up to 1 foot
@nynjpaweather will it reach nyc
@JimCantore I"m not completely sure, but I think i heard at least one or two rumbles of thunder outside around 8 A.M. in bayside, queens
@weatherwilly what time might that happen
@weatherwilly could a mesoscale band form over nyc

@mikebettes #WUTV last night was not a bust. There were several week tornados, widespread wind damage and dozens of hailstorms.
#askSPC Will the moderate risk be updated to a high risk today?
@NWSNewYorkNY Because Queens and Brooklyn are technically part of Long Island. Or did you only mean Nassau and Suffolk Counties? Thank you.
@NWSNewYorkNY By stating that there might be 3-5 inches of snow for long island did you also mean queens?
And the suburbs of course
A moderate band of snow is creeping back into Nantucket as the Barnstable County lull ends. Moderate snow still sticking around over Boston.
High waves in England. Nothing abnormal. But still, very dangerous. Life threatening even.
The national weather service should use radar estimates instead. Way more accurate.
I also think that waves, coastal flooding, and blowing snow make it almost impossible for people to accurately measure snow totals.
I disagree with most of the additional snow forecast from Winter Storm Mars. Definitely more than 3 inches in parts of Massachusetts.
Does this inverted trough situation remind anyone of another storm. Winter Storm Dion? Record snow in Pennsylvania? December 2013 anyone?
And Winter Storm Mars could definitely bring up to 12 inches of snow in Boston. Maybe up to 18 inches in the southeastern Massachusetts.
As a fellow meteorologist, I think that Winter Storm Nacio could dump up to 8 inches of snow from Philadelphia to Annapolis and Baltimore.
