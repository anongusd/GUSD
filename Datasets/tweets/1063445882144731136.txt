@MichaelAvenatti @shannonrwatts This law (assuming hell freezes over and it passes the senate and POTUS doesn’t veto it) also has to be self enforced - which will never happen.

@MichaelAvenatti @shannonrwatts “Shall not be infringed”. 		Thankfully this ignorant bill will die in the senate.
I just learned that @YouTube terminated Don Shipley’s account Extreme Seal Adventures for exposing Nathan Phillips’ stolen valor. 		What a crock.
Nothing on this earth would make me happier than a class action lawsuit and jail time for these robocall companies.
@hqtrivia for the love of God, can we please have a Golden Girls trivia night? 😂
@RealSaavedra Disgusting.
Gun control does absolutely nothing but prohibit law abiding citizens from carrying what they are constitutionally allowed to bear for personal safety.
Simply because the state that I’m traveling to does not recognize a permit to lawfully carry my firearm. 		Yet, I’m legally allowed to operate a motor vehicle in any of the 50 US states.
I’ve served over 12 years of honorable military service. I have numerous government clearances. I’ve had only 1 speeding ticket in my life. 		When I travel for military duties, I cannot take my firearm with me for personal safety (that I’m legally allowed to carry in TN).
It amazes me at how long it takes the ATF to process a form 4 so that I can go pick up my suppressor.
@AndrewYangVFA you know what would be better than receiving a wasteful $1,000 per month for nothing?		Keeping money from our paychecks instead of giving it to worthless funding programs, such as what you’ve proposed.
@WCYB_Ricky Dan Pope sounds like an ass. 😂
@NetflixIsAJoke Nothing. But you could also say spiders.
So far the Patriots have:		6 SuperBowl Rings	1 Prostituon Ring. 		😂

One of the best feelings about owning your own company is the interactions and personal relationships you build with your clients. Truly being able to help people and giving them peace of mind is a true blessing.
