@jp_0037 @KevinNR Fulbright and both Byrds all voted against the Civil Rights Act of 1964
@KevinNR Read Paths Out of Dixie by @robmickey. Explains those numbers in GA &amp; MS, as well as why SC had more Rs by then
@KevinNR But polarization grew, and split ticket voting became more rare, &amp; local results in South followed nat'l ones, which had swung R in 64
@KevinNR It was gradual process. Downballot Dems able to differentiate from nat'l brand for a while, just like Rs in New England.
@KevinNR Circumstantial evidence: Thurmond himself endorsed Goldwater and became a Republican in September 1964
@KevinNR &amp; given miserable showings for Dewey in those states, some combo of Truman voters or Thurmond voters went Goldwater over LBJ.
@KevinNR Not 100% dispositive obviously, but given large margins both times &amp; similarities in pro-states rights messages, it's strong evidence.
@KevinNR No he didn't. Stevenson carried all the states in question twice, with lone exception of LA in 56.

@MarkARKleiman @delong not bad life advice
@PaulBegala actually very plausible names for Trump's children
@Harlan i think a good rule would be only make scary videos about things that you deem disqualifying. which "socialism" obvs isn't for you
@Harlan Hillary's "socialism" is bad enough to make a scary video about but Sanders's socialism is outweighed by dovishness &amp; anti-estab?
@Harlan I'm not assuming that. I'm just responding to it because you made an entire video about it
@Harlan and that raises question...you supported bernie even though you equated him with chavez???
@Harlan I'm not assuming...you posted a video saying she was like Chavez!!
@Harlan so both 1) it's a bad argument b/c completely off base comparison &amp; 2) you have no credibility to make it b/c supported bernie
@Harlan (and she's not a socialist, btw...and bernie is so different than chavez that using the term "socialist" for both misleads greatly)
@Harlan but don't-vote-for-hillary-b/c-socialist argument isn't credible coming from you when your 1st choice was self-avowed socialist
@Harlan fine, but then how can you logically oppose Hillary with the "she's like Chavez" argument? (chavez was also anti-estab, btw)
@Harlan you initially supported socialist Bernie (obvs not Chavez but you brought it up)...but now never Hillary cause socialism?
