Leaders, 1 simple goal for the day: have a conversation with a team member &amp; look into their eyes. No texting  while talking. Be present!
Try this...Today is the day you don't check email first thing. Instead, focus your morning energy on that project you've been ignoring.
The turning point to anything that's not working out in your life begins with the decision to change just 1 thing now #leadfromwithin
