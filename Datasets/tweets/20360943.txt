No city council vote on food trucks | #FoodTruckNews |  http://t.co/hMvgVWM1jk
.@ElenasFilipino Very cool shot.
@DatCajunGuy I wish I could make it out there to get some myself.
Do you love #bacon? Do you love #chicken? DO you love #foodtrucks? Then youre gonna love this #SMPL http://t.co/Erk9bj3oRF
@dkMOMUS I enjoy the convenience as much as the next man, but I also recognize that it's just that. Convenience. Hence "convenience charges"
@dkMOMUS Let's say hypothetically those figures are true, all it means is a few people have a lot of cards. Interesting, sure. But relevant?
@dkMOMUS I find humor in padded numbers and that people put any value in it. "Argumentum Ad Populum" is logic 101.
Are you on Instagram? Check out our #EatTheStreet pics on our IG account http://t.co/V8N1VkPGFG
@dkMOMUS Lol
@dokihara Lol. 1.5 billion is an extremely padded number too, considering there are only 317mil people including children and elderly.
@dokihara I agree the potential to lose a couple of sales is there. But those who have been doing a cash business for decades don't see it
@dokihara 71% is an extremely padded number considering the number of children and elderly. You mean 71% of people who chose to be polled ;)
@rodney_o Remember, it's just as easy to say "you should always have cash" as it is to say "they should always accept credit".
I could go for a nice warm malasada right now. http://t.co/6M40MbbZfG
@dokihara I don't know about a "large group", but it certainly would be more convenient if every business accepted credit in a perfect world
@rodney_o Many businesses are cash only, and for various different reasons. Everyone has a different reason.
The dont know how, dont have the required equipment, etc RT @Edgar_In_Hawaii: @dokihara i would like to know that answer too. @streetgrindz
@KoloheBoy I too prefer to pay with a card. But at the end of the day, each truck represents an individual business and it is their decision
@dkMOMUS I don't think it has anything to do with that. Like I said, it's a generational thing. The younger operators tend to use plastic.
@Edgar_In_Hawaii the trucks set their own prices at the events. We do not control that whatsoever.
@dokihara Actually, many of them do not use social media. It's a generational thing generally.
Are you ready for Eat The Street: Japan on March 28th? | #EatTheStreet #SaveTheDate
@dokihara that's why we keep an ATM on location at our events. That way if you forgot to get cash, it's still available.  ;)
@Edgar_In_Hawaii again, the 2% fee isn't the only deterrent. That is a very narrow scope of what all is involved in the process.
@Edgar_In_Hawaii there are many possible reasons that trucks do not use square.
