Marty's and my show "An Evening You'll Forget for the Rest of Your Life," is now streaming on @netflix. If you don't like it, then you and I have an issue.
RT @almac64: @SteveMartinToGo It’s amazing what you two will risk for your art.
Sunday morning will never be the same. https://t.co/EIfnnLYNtk
Marty and I traveled for months to get these shots. https://t.co/DZtq77qSbE
That is not me. https://t.co/1TOYoGjqaL
Here’s what I would do. Watch the special on Netflix, then have some upheaval in your life like a broken romance. Then see it live and think, “this reminds me of long ago.” https://t.co/y6ewVoMa65
One of our best reviews ever, and well-written to boot. Don’t forget us on Netflix May 25. https://t.co/QUhkjwpvC3
And I love that you made no negative comments. It’s enough that we just hang ourselves! https://t.co/7Wyyy8x3wj
It will be in the UK. I checked with offshore pirates. https://t.co/vX5bz1cwew
Hey, Marty and I have our new NetFlix show on at the end of the month. This month, not just any month. Here's a trailer. The only trailer. All other trailers are fake trailers. @NetflixIsAJoke https://t.co/2tdbtxuPtq

Here is the elaborate, thought-out announcement. https://t.co/HB2pNE7Lf6
Marty Short and I will be on Fallon tonight. (This is the vanilla, pared-down, no-hype announcement. Flowery, all-hype announcement will follow).
Congrats to Amy Schumer for her Tony nom for Meteor Shower!
I recognize you from your photo! https://t.co/WhvSCQnWGp
Best photo ever of me.  Finally, my hair looks great. https://t.co/n76uQ3pxVI

Eric’s announcement is only equally exciting. There is nothing more exciting than my announcement. https://t.co/X9wLW6FH1u
I think you’re underestimating its bigness. https://t.co/WIaE7Nb3Vz
Ham and ham? https://t.co/5y5y1wEWEr
No malarkey. This is real. It’s very real. May 25th. @netflix https://t.co/1trIfmYjcW
BIG ANNOUNCEMENT: Marty Short’s and my new @netflix special will be aired May 25th! “An Evening You Will Forget for the Rest of Your Life.” 		I sure you thought, “I’ll bet it’s not a big announcement,” and now you have to eat your thoughts. Because it’s undeniably big. https://t.co/kYjD0m0Qer
If you like big announcements - and I think you do - hang in there for a few minutes while I dress.
Whoa, horsie! https://t.co/ZlsaeOJ4QE
