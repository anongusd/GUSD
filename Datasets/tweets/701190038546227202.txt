@Dagny_Galt @misstozak @JacobAWohl @nikkihaley @GOP @KamalaHarris @mike_pence Hey @Dagny_Galt - just noticed the #AnyRand reference in your Twitter handle ... which of Ayn's books do you most recommend?
@Dagny_Galt @misstozak @JacobAWohl @nikkihaley @GOP @KamalaHarris @mike_pence @BarackObama @HillaryClinton @TheDemocrats My original point was that while @KamalaHarris will easily defeat @mike_pence in 2020 - Kamala will have a much harder time defeating @nikkihaley in 2024
@Dagny_Galt @misstozak @JacobAWohl @nikkihaley @GOP @KamalaHarris @mike_pence @BarackObama @HillaryClinton Kamala will win the 2020 election in part because she can reassemble to #ObamaCoalition which will be amplified by #MeToo- but in larger measure because while @mike_pence is a nice guy, @TheDemocrats will be able to hang the entire #TrumpDisaster around his neck ...
@Dagny_Galt @misstozak @JacobAWohl @nikkihaley @GOP @KamalaHarris @mike_pence Obama won in 2008 and again in 2012. Hillary won the popular vote in 2016. Democratic strategists will not take the upper Midwest for granted in 2020. Draw a line from Obama to Hillary and you will find Kamala about 1/3 of the way from @BarackObama to @HillaryClinton

@JacobAWohl @nikkihaley @GOP @KamalaHarris @mike_pence @TheDemocrats Having swept to power in 2020 in a wave of disgust over the #TrumpDisaster #MAGAisReallyAboutWhiteMaleRage - the @KamalaHarris administration will over play its hand and open the door to 2024 being the year @nikkihaley becomes #PreisdentNikki
@JacobAWohl @nikkihaley @GOP @KamalaHarris @mike_pence @TheDemocrats #Nikki2024 has the potential to fully counter #Kamala2020 ‚Äòs winning message of inclusion - American voters will gravitate to #Kamala2020 in large measure because of the deep, deep negative reaction to the white nationalist and male rage that is the basis of #MAGA
@JacobAWohl @nikkihaley @GOP @KamalaHarris @mike_pence @TheDemocrats Getting back to @nikkihaley - #Kamala2024 will be a much harder lift for @TheDemocrats then #Kamala2020 for largely the same reasons (in reverse) that will make #Pence2020 so difficult - the #TwoPartySystem will remain out of sync with the broad American middle until after 2024
@JacobAWohl @nikkihaley @GOP @KamalaHarris @mike_pence @TheDemocrats And the #zealots who form the base of the @GOP will force #PresidentPence to adopt a set of policy stances that will be completely out of step with a post-Trump electorate ... and thus the door opens for @KamalaHarris #Kamala2020

@JacobAWohl @nikkihaley @GOP @KamalaHarris @mike_pence A large majority of American‚Äôs will approve of President @mike_pence ‚Äòs first year in office - largely because of the gentle, calming tone he will adopt in the wake of the #TrumpDisaster .. but come February 2020 the Iowa Caucus will be upon us ...
@JacobAWohl @nikkihaley @GOP @KamalaHarris @mike_pence @mike_pence is a decent man and a competent #PublicServant - And he will act as a solid balance against the inevitable excesses of the #BlueWave of @TheDemocrats come January 2019 ...
@JacobAWohl @nikkihaley @GOP @KamalaHarris @mike_pence On this general topic, my prediction in that @mike_pence will assume the Oval Office between 9 and 10 months from now ... as an American first and a #LiberalDemocrat second, I will be profoundly relieved to see #PresidentPence take the oath ...
@JacobAWohl @nikkihaley @GOP @KamalaHarris @mike_pence I further think that @nikkihaley is the @GOP candidate most capable of defeating @KamalaHarris in 2024 ...possibly the only #GOP2024 candidate who could defeat her ... I put Nikki‚Äôs chances in 2024 at 60% ...
@JacobAWohl Agree that there is a very good chance @nikkihaley will be the first @GOP Presidential Candidate. And I agree that she will be the candidate in 2024 ... Running against @KamalaHarris who will running for her 2nd term having defeated President @mike_pence in 2020 ...

@funder @HillaryClinton The clock ticks away, and soon November 2018 will be upon us. The @GOP is full of clowns like Leslie Gibsons. The end of Republican rule in Washington will be epic.
@funder Here is the underlying truth: Americans hate bullies. Americans do not take kindly to politicians how shoot down. @HillaryClinton was a hugely problematic candidate - and Trump caught a lucky break in early November 2016.
@John13971 @BeHeardAmerican @Julia_in_DE @JohnBrennan @mccaffreyr3 @DonaldJTrumpJr @realDonaldTrump The IC is not going to be left holding the bag on this attack on America. They are going to spill the beans on #DJT and it will be glorious to behold
@John13971 @BeHeardAmerican @Julia_in_DE @JohnBrennan @mccaffreyr3 @DonaldJTrumpJr @realDonaldTrump The next shoes are about to drop - the IC has now had time to reverse engineer the Putin - Trump #AxisOfVenality - and they are providing fair warning to @SenateMajLdr and @SpeakerRyan
@John13971 @BeHeardAmerican @Julia_in_DE @JohnBrennan @mccaffreyr3 @DonaldJTrumpJr Which brings us back to @mccaffreyr3 and @JohnBrennan issuing unprecedented statements about the venality of @realDonaldTrump

@John13971 @BeHeardAmerican @Julia_in_DE @JohnBrennan @mccaffreyr3 May careers at the NSA / CIA were destroyed - quietly - post 911 because people were too conservative in their analysis and thus didn‚Äôt connect the dots
@John13971 @BeHeardAmerican @Julia_in_DE @JohnBrennan @mccaffreyr3 One way to think about the dynamics currently in play is to consider the lessons learned by the Intel community post #911
@John13971 @BeHeardAmerican @Julia_in_DE @JohnBrennan General @mccaffreyr3 issued a similar #DogWhistle to the Republican Congress that the National Defence + Intel community is about to ramp up the leaks by an order of magnitude
@John13971 @BeHeardAmerican @Julia_in_DE @JohnBrennan For the former head of the CIA to call a sitting President #venal ... tells you that they know things they are not yet willing to divulge ... but the none too subtle warning to people around Trump is clear - cut #DJT loose or go down in flames with him

We can probably rule out my previous notion that Sam Nunberg is engaged in Performance Art at a level of sophistication so advanced that we can't yet appreciate where he was taking this.
I feel very sorry for Sam Nunberg. He is troubled. He needs help. My hope is that he does not appear on any more cable news shows.

@snapshutter @NessaJ785 @realDonaldTrump @DLoesch 5/4 - If our #MadKingDonald can activate 60 million votes, rest assured that @DLoesch could muster 70 million + votes under the right conditions.		Bottom Line: Keep your friends close and your enemies closer.		Watch this space.
@snapshutter @NessaJ785 4/4 - Finally - consider this thought: @realDonaldTrump is a very weak marketer relative to the #ZenMaster level skills on exhibit by @DLoesch - it would be a huge mistake to underestimate her. What remains true is that 60 million plus people voted for #TheDonald
@snapshutter @NessaJ785 3/4 - It would be a mistake to condemn her or dismiss Dana's work. Our ability to understand the extraordinary resistance that the #GunLobby has been able to muster - despite their very small numbers relative to American society as a whole - is enhanced by studying her Tweets.
@snapshutter @NessaJ785 2/4 - Future anthropologists will carefully analyze her Twitter feed as it paints a very concise and easy to follow listing of the things that a #WorldClass marketer and entrepreneur would say to activate middle aged white males so that they open their wallets.

@maggieNYT @DLoesch @realDonaldTrump 2/2 - My rough calculation puts this new market segment in the range of 700,000 units.

A number of remaining gun regulations at the state level will be eliminated in future months as a direct result of the recent Florida shooting.
Death and destruction are not just a result of their singular focus on maximizing the profits of weapons manufacturers - school shootings are a feature of the #NRA‚Äôs lobbying efforts.
All other companies / lobbying firms at least pretend to operate within some sort of moral framework. The #NRA has freed itself of any constraint.
The #NRA ‚Äòs cynicism stands alone in its audacity. No other marketing / lobbying team in America is prepared to operate with a complete lack of morality. Indeed the operate with immortal intent.
