@USA77 To work in the mine you have to work for the mine company, and they donate to Republicans. How is that different from the unions?
Unions are representative of free market forces in a way boardroom bureaucrats never do. #WI
Union busting is the nationalization of private corporations. #WI
Public sector unions are PRIVATE CORPORATIONS. #WI
@jjmnolte Every time you bust a union, your nationalizing a private corporation, commie.
@jjmnolte A supreme court selected by Republicans bought by corporations makes the Citizens United ruling, but unions are insidious somehow?
@jjmnolte But I guess small government doesn't count when it comes to employees, gays, women, immigrants, muslims, or your political rivals
@jjmnolte Also, considering unions are private corporations, your love with union-busting is as anti-free-market as it gets.
@jjmnolte Double standard. The corporation can steal my wealth and donate it to pols, but the unions shouldn't have that right?
@jjmnolte If I want to work in a mine, I have to work for the Mine Company, and they make political donations I disagree with.
