@allafarce @MikeIsaac @kimmaicutler @libbycwatson That‚Äôs a good point - data from KFF suggests California has some of the lowest Medicaid reimbursement rates in the country. 		At the same time, other CA hospitals have heavy Medicaid usage but aren‚Äôt doing this‚Ä¶		https://t.co/KM8FrDANl5
Interesting idea out of NYC: a city-level public option! https://t.co/rTra3RGdu1
@MikeIsaac @kimmaicutler @libbycwatson Debt collection is a pretty costly business to get into! Most hospitals prefer to have reliable reimbursement from insurers rather than chasing after patients for five-figure bills.		If this was a real money maker, I‚Äôd expect other hospitals to be doing it to. But they‚Äôre not.
@MikeIsaac @kimmaicutler @libbycwatson So the answer that ZSFG gives is they need to support the underserved (both uninsured and those on MediCal, which tends to pay lower rates). 		This seems suspect to me, however, given that other hospitals deal with much larger uninsured populations ‚Äî and (1/2)

@kimmaicutler The best thing that I have is a list of their prices, which are approved by the San Francisco Board of Supervisors. https://t.co/q1IPd0XvlW
@micahstubbs @Swizec Yes, this is one of the best data sources there is! Unfortunately though, those data sets will only give you high-level state data and not info about specific hospitals' practices, which make them less useful for patients trying to avoid surprise bills.
@askellyphd @larry_levitt So, this is the one part of the story that still has me stumped. If this was a big revenue generator, I'd expect more hospitals to behave similarly! But you don't really see that. And its expensive/annoying to constantly chase down debt from patients.
@ldelavaissiere @BriannaWu The hospital is overseen by the San Francisco Board of Supervisors, which is currently led by @MaliaCohen. That board sets their prices. Hope that helps!
@sflily @sanjayofSF @UCSF @BrentChiuWatson @UCSFHospitals If you have a moment, it'd be great if you could submit your bills to our database: https://t.co/2wOM4bB4TW. Thank you in advance!!
@aneeshchopra @khemp64 @afrakt @commonwealthfnd @DavidBlumenthal Yes - it‚Äôs in-network for Medicare and Medicaid (or in CA, Medi-Cal) but not for QHPs on the marketplace.
@JonWalkerDC Fair point ‚Äî although the weird thing is that ZSFG‚Äôs prices are actually regulated by the city. It‚Äôs just that the prices the city has set are really, really high.
If you're a San Francisco resident frustrated with how Zuckerberg General is billing, a lot of your frustration should really rest with the city board of supervisors.		You should also know that SF Board of Supervisors President Malia Cohen declined to comment for my story. (6/6)
You can see the prices that San Francisco set for 2019 in the doc I link below. 		They're described as "reasonable amounts." Patients and medical billing experts would likely beg to differ. (5/6)		https://t.co/q1IPd0XvlW
Things get a little bananas when you dig into why the prices are so high.		Turns out, the **city of San Francisco** is the one setting these high prices.		More specifically, the San Francisco Board of Supervisors is "determining and fixing" rates for Zuckerberg General. (4/6)
Here are some prices from the ZSFG emergency room, culled from bills I've reviewed:	Pregnancy test - $111	X-ray of an elbow - $362	Facility fee for using the emergency room ‚Äî $11,176	CT Scan - $2,979		(3/6)
ZSFG routinely bills really high prices. In one case that I wrote about today, the prices were 12 times those that Medicare pays. Twelve times! (2/6)
Something I didn‚Äôt get into in my Zuckerberg hospital story: 		One things that leaves patients with big bills is the fact that the hospital is out of network.		But the other is that the hospital has really high prices. We should look at those, too. (1/6)	https://t.co/XjHpmZq3i9
@LorenAdler @C_Garthwaite @berthacoombs Ironically SF does seem to have price regulation‚Ä¶except the regulation is pushing prices way, way up.
@LorenAdler @C_Garthwaite @berthacoombs The SF Board of Supervisors oversees ZSFG prices. You can see the full price list here ‚Äî the numbers in this doc always match the bills I review.		https://t.co/q1IPd0XvlW
@C_Garthwaite @berthacoombs I didn‚Äôt even get into this in the story ‚Äî maybe I should ‚Äî but it is actually the city of San Francisco that *sets* ZSFG‚Äôs incredibly high prices.
RT @lkmcgann: This is the name of the hospital: https://t.co/vuDDzKjVj7 https://t.co/7sT7MiBzPb
@LorenAdler @jasonlevitis @larry_levitt So depending on which oversees your plan, the rules are different. DMHC is generally meant for managed care ‚Äî but doesn't line up completely. And as Larry says, all of this is kind of moot for ERISA plans.
@LorenAdler @jasonlevitis @larry_levitt So my understanding of the CA regulatory landscape is that there are not one, but two agencies (DMHC/DOI) overseeing health care ‚Äî and they have different rules about balance billing.  DMHC outlaws balance billing while DOI allows it.
RT @ZTracer: The most surprising billing practice I‚Äôve ever seen, too, especially for a public hospital https://t.co/JwnmbTYds3

Both @SenatorHassan and @SenatorCassidy have introduced bills to prevent surprise bills. 		But for now, the behavior of the Zuckerberg Hospital appears to remain perfectly legal. And a lot more patients are going to get a lot more big bills (9/11)	https://t.co/KNQOfHSeoM
How do we fix it?		California actually has really strong laws protecting patients from surprise bills! 		Unfortunately, the people I write about have insurance regulated at the federal level. They need Congress to do something.		And Congress does have a few ideas! (8/11)
I kept seeing these bills turn up in our database. At first, I thought they were a weird anomaly. 		But then there were more. And more.		It got to the point where I could tell a bill was from ZSFG before I saw the hospital's name. That's how abnormal their practices are. (7/11)
It means that Alicia Rodriquez is fighting a $10,001 bill. She was taken to ZSFG when she had a migraine so bad that she *couldn't see.* Of course she wasn't in the place to research the network status of the hospital where an ambulance would take her. (6/11) https://t.co/K6EP04x2L7
It means that Nina Dang, who was brought to the hospital semi-lucid after a bike accident, is now fighting a $20,243 bill for the afternoon she spent at the emergency room. (5/11) https://t.co/97aSYUBlhB
And it's not just my data that says this: @zackcooperYale and @cjrhgarmon find that 99 percent of ER visits happen at in-network facilities.		But ZSFG is in the 1 percent. That has huge financial consequences for patients (4/11)
This is *really* unusual. Like I said, I have read hundreds of ER bills.		 Sometimes doctors are out-of-network. But the ER itself is almost always in-network.		That makes a lot of sense: patients often don't get a choice in where to seek care in an emergent situation (3/11)
Zuckerberg San Francisco General is the largest hospital in the city.		It is San Francisco's only level one trauma center.		But it is not in-network with any private health insurance plan. (2/11)
Thread üëá		I have spent a year reading emergency room bills. I've read about 1,200 of them. 		A few months ago, I noticed that one hospital had bills that were *really* different from the rest: Zuckerberg San Francisco General. (1/11)	https://t.co/XjHpmZq3i9

The question I get the most lately is: how do I get my ER bill lowered? Frustratingly, I haven‚Äôt learned much about that. It‚Äôs really up to the hospitals if they want to negotiate or not. (9/11)
I learned that it feels really vulnerable and confusing to be an ER patient, when I had to go to the emergency room over the summer. I write about ER bills for a living ‚Äî but I had no clue how to avoid a surprise one for myself. (8/11)		https://t.co/v7s0D4fker
I learned that patients can be billed for just sitting in a waiting room sometimes upwards of $5,000.		I learned that even at in-network hospitals, patients can face high bills from out-of-network doctors. (7/11)		https://t.co/wSwbIXRHny
Since prices aren‚Äôt public, its impossible for patients to know if they‚Äôre at the hospital that charges $1 for a generic ointment ‚Äî or the one that charges 76 times more. (6/11)
The costs are high ‚Äî and they vary hugely from hospital to hospital. Case in point: I found one hospital charging $1 for a squirt of an antibiotic ointment called bacitracin ‚Äî¬†and another charging $76. (5/11)
Emergency room prices are HIGH. Even for things you could buy at the pharmacy.		I read at least five bills where a pregnancy test costs more than $100. That‚Äôs 20x the cost of a very nice pregnancy test on Amazon! (4/11)		https://t.co/fhck7cQH3G

This means I will pay another co-pay and get a little unnecessary radiation....all because our electronic health records don‚Äôt talk to each other.
Addendum: got a call from my doctors office - the files on the CD are in the wrong format! So now we are just going to redo the x-rays. 		Not because I *need* new x-rays, but because there isn‚Äôt a way to transfer the data. ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è https://t.co/XeDk3TAENe

The one place that Medicaid lost is Montana. Voters there rejected a ballot initiative to continue their Medicaid expansion. My guess is the legislature there will step in and fund it instead of letting ~130k people lose insurance.

Well perhaps some good can come of this, aside from me just ranting on Twitter. If y‚Äôall want to send me what you paid for a 3D Dental X-Ray in Washington, D.C./where you were seen I will post that in a public spreadsheet somewhere that might be of use to another person someday.
@jjseidman Yes! The information asymmetry is very large here.
@afrakt This might actually be the rare health care procedure where you could crowdsource the price, given that it seems like its not covered by insurers (hence no complications of negotiated prices v charges)
Now I‚Äôm getting more info about this from people tweeting me the prices of their own 3D x-rays than I could from all my Googling. Which is helpful for me, but not an especially great sign for health care price transparency!
The person my dentist referred me to wants to charge $325. IS that a good price? I have no idea!		But now my choices are to spend time calling a bunch of other endodontists to find their prices, calling it quits and paying $325, or being lazy and not getting the scan at all.
Except, it is near impossible to find price information. Endodontists don‚Äôt list this information on their websites. 		Google ‚Äúprice of 3d dental x-ray‚Äù and you get the price of buying an x-ray machine. Tack on ‚Äúin D.C‚Äù and it still doesn‚Äôt get better.
A few thoughts on why shopping for health care is so hard, inspired by my recent dentist visit.		My dentist told me I need a 3D x-ray. Something weird going on with a few of my teeth. 		My insurance doesn‚Äôt cover this type of scan - so I *should* be very price sensitive.

I write about health care for a living. I have access to a lot of experts in medical billing. But I still don‚Äôt have a great idea how to figure out if the anesthesiologist I‚Äôll see will be in my network or out of it.
@BenJudge91 I will try that!
The other wrinkle here is I don‚Äôt really have control over which anesthesiologist is on-call when I‚Äôm at the hospital. 		Anyway, situations like these seem to put the consumer in a pretty tough situation.
My current plan is to try calling the hospital to see if they‚Äôll give me a list of anesthesiologists who work in labor and delivery, and then checking that list with my insurance. 		Will it work? Who knows! I will keep y‚Äôall updated.
A question sort-of related to my story today:		I‚Äôm having a baby in a few weeks. My OB is in-network. My hospital is in-network. But I‚Äôm not sure about the anesthesiologist ‚Äî largely because I don‚Äôt know who he or she will be! 		How can do I avoid a surprise bill?

After I called the oral surgeon‚Äôs office, Scott found out they planned to reverse the bill entirely. 		Which is great for him - but still leaves this really big problem of out-of-network providers at in-network facilities for a whole bunch of other patients. (6/10)
This type of billing happens pretty frequently, especially where Scott lives in Texas. 		One study estimates that for his insurance, a staggering number of ER‚Äôs in Texas have *zero* in-network doctors: https://t.co/duZPtujFH3	(5/10)
This is how he ends up with a $7,924 bill from the oral surgeon that his insurance denies. 		I wrote about his story today: https://t.co/1Eo03qomk2	(4/10)
Good news it is!		Except, it kind of sort of isn‚Äôt: turns out that the oral surgeon who sees Scott in the ER is out of network. He doesn‚Äôt accept any medical insurance. 		But Scott doesn‚Äôt know this at the time. He assumes, in-network hospital means in-network docs. (3/10)
Scott wakes up at Dell Seton Memorial Hospital in Austin. 		He‚Äôs worried about his jaw. But he‚Äôs worried about his bill. 		So he immediately gets on his iPhone and starts trying to figure out if this hospital is in-network. (2/10)

@KellyMDoran @JSchuurMD @zackcooperYale Agree with you there - but doesn‚Äôt a lot of the responsibility there sit with the people setting charges and communicating them to patients? (I‚Äôm talking about hospital CFOs here, not ER docs). My reporting suggests patients would be less scared if they knew what bills to expect.
@movinmeat @embasic Fair enough, but I think from the patient perspective this looks pretty different. The surgeon comes into the ER, consults with the patient there. He is working in and seeing patients in the ER.
@KellyMDoran @JSchuurMD Separately, I think @zackcooperYale's research on ER staffing suggests that this is a challenge that spreads pretty widely across different types of physicians working in ERs. 		https://t.co/wkszNnrNqw
@KellyMDoran @JSchuurMD This is from the Garmon study I cite in the piece, which unfortunately doesn't have that level of specificity. It's here: https://t.co/pQpHrEccLs		This separate report from TX suggests its a problem that spreads across ED docs/specialists https://t.co/7HaBG49X70
@embasic It's an ER issue because these out-of-network surgeons are working at in-network ERs.
@KellyMDoran @JSchuurMD Morning! I think it's fair to use ER in the headline because that is the site where the patients I'm writing about are receiving care. As I note in the article, 14 percent of ER patients who remain outpatient also face out-of-network bills.

We would LOVE to have some data scientist collaborators on this project. If you‚Äôre someone who studies health billing, get in touch. https://t.co/6s67aKCZv1
And if you want to learn more about that $629 Band Aid, check out the first episode of The Impact! (11/11) https://t.co/WbxIR3lrKZ
Thank you, thank you, thank you so much in advance! So thrilled to see where this story goes (10/11)
I‚Äôll use this data for a year long project on health care billing. We‚Äôll bring transparency to one corner of American health care. (9/11)
We need help. Because these fees are secret, we need you to share your ER bills through our secure website: https://t.co/2wOM4bB4TW (8/11)
Today, I wrote a story about a $25,000 bill for an MRI. That only happens in America. (7/11)	https://t.co/fhck7cQH3G https://t.co/cJ8iEoSyk9
Facility fees are a small window into the biggest problem in American health care: our outlandish prices. (6/11)
Today, I‚Äôm launching a big project to answer these questions. We are crowdsourcing a database of facility fees using YOUR bills. (5/11)
I‚Äôve been obsessed with facility fees since. Hospitals keep them secret. How much are facility fees? Do they vary? How are they set? (4/11)
In the case of the $629 Band Aid, the bill broke down to $7 for the Band Aid and $622 for the facility fee. (3/11)		https://t.co/2CuYWH1S9H
I started poking around. I learned about something called an ‚ÄúER facility fee.‚Äù A base price for seeking any care in an ER setting. (2/11)

RT @JStein_Vox: I talked to @BernieSanders about why private insurance must be virtually eradicated for true universal coverage 	https://t.‚Ä¶
Maybe makes sense for the moment, this bill isn‚Äôt going anywhere this year. Eventually, need to transition to more realistic plan. (2/2)
The Sanders‚Äô bill is a single-payer wish list. It doesn‚Äôt get into the tough questions of what doesn‚Äôt get covered, how to pay for it (1/2).
@hyperplanes Yep, I read it that way too.
Good frame for the Sanders‚Äô legislation ‚Äî this is not a full single-payer plan. It isn‚Äôt paid for. It‚Äôs a starting point. https://t.co/4dYu8lzNv2
The Sanders‚Äô plan does not include any pay-fors. Huge hurdle, especially for generous system bill envisions. https://t.co/tiKCL89m24
