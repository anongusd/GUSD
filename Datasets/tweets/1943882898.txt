I submitted Tradocracy Bill to Nigeria Parliament for consideration. I also wrote letters on Tradocracy to United Nation n African Union.
The fact that not all marriages procreate, does not rule out the purpose of marriage.
Acceptance of gay marriage n transgender lower d dignity of mankind. Gay marriage might leads to disappearance of male humans from d  eath.
To love or to have a friend is different from marriage. Marriage is legal union of a man n woman for the purpose of procreation.
One does not need constitution or law to have a friend or to love some one. Gay marriage is abuse of Human right.

Mr President,send a bill to house of assembly for the return of regional govt n use presidential or veto power for the bill to be a law
Nigeria President must use his executive power or veto power for the establishment of regional govt for survival of the country.
Establishment of regional govt bill to Nigeria national assembly might not scale through but the president must veto the bill.
Nigeria President should send a bill to parliament for the return of regional govt to weaken the current war of the insurgence in country.
Nigeria civil war made the military head state to split the regions into 12 states to stabilized the country. The country is at war again
The only way to win war against insurgence n rebel in Nigeria is for the President to bring back regional govt, which re six zones to day.
The British Govt gave Nigeria Independence with the inclusion of regional govt, each region having its one military.

EU n USA must stop unnecessary sanctions on Russia n avoid conflict in the world. Russia interest in the old USSR must be respected.
War on Gaza must stop now. Israel must must free the blockage on Gaza n Palestine must accept Israel as part of them n live in harmony.
If people with different cultural n religious background live together in a country, Israel n Palestine should live together in one country
@NigeriaNewsdesk Boko Haram is bigger insult to the peaceful coexistence of Nigerian. We need regional govts n regional arm forces
President Putin of Russia should advocate for peaceful unification of Soviet Union but with a democratic government.
@LollyDaskal You re right.
I am not happy about the disintegration of the former Soviet Union.
I love Russia military  moves on Ukraine. Ukraine must not disintegrate because of political unrest. Ukraine must be Russia n vise visa.

Apartheid law was legal in SA and USA years ago but did not mean that the law was right or moral. Not all laws re moral.
@NotGayDalek @TBWhite11 Gay is not right and is not moral. Laws must contain moral ingredient in its content not just raw legal content only
@NotGayDalek @TBWhite11 Apartheid law was legal in SA and USA years ago did mean the law was right or moral.
@NotGayDalek @TBWhite11 Gay might be legal in some countries does not make it right or moral. Morality is the judge of law.

Try tradocracy today; a new system of government.
It is morally wrong that a system of govt is designed for the participation of the rich only. The rich re very few population of a society.
Tradocracy does not abuse the right of majority because money is not tagged on electoral competition. http://t.co/zcUqjWdudF
Tradocracy is better than democracy mainly because of four arms, electoral system, department of morality and administration pattern .
Tradocratic system of government makes electoral competition free for all. It is the govt of the people not govt of the rich only
The right of majority of people is abused when money is tagged for electoral competition. Equity/equality must be ensured at all times.
Electoral process/competition must be free for all. Government belongs to every body not the rich alone. Money should not be a yardstick
The poor and the rich have the right to contest for election. Money tagged for election should not prevent majority from contesting election
Money tagged for electoral process/competition brings down democracy as if is the govt against the people.Every one must be allow to contest
There should not be class different in selection of candidate for election http://t.co/XOIe5bgzyG
Democratic electoral process should restructure in a way to prevent rigging. But give equality n fairness of electoral process to all
@LollyDaskal Could you please explain further? I did not quite get the meaning of your statement
@LakeshaIams That is right
New year may bring new approach of handling world affairs. Laws should have moral ingredient in its content not just raw legal content alone
Apartheid n immoral laws re not healthy for any country. These types of laws do bring humans to zero level of dignity http://t.co/eRgk1Scey1
Because legality is not morality, some laws have caused pains, injuries, n set back to homes n communities.Is gay marriage moral?
Not all laws re moral. Apartheid laws of S A and US years ago where legal but not moral. Morality is the judge of law http://t.co/ZODVuJmZk9

Tradocracy a new system of government, alternative, advanced and a better system of government to democracy. Try tradocracy today.
Ministry of creative ability should be created in all the countries of the world.
Eating of none natural food contribute to weak health. Ministry of health should look at d life style of people nt just treatment of disease
One is constantly expose to industrial waste n sound. Radiations scientific instruments like hand sets, remotes etc weakens the the health.
Ministry of health needs to brace up n face the health challenges. The more the advancement in medical science the more the weak health.
Gay marriage is malignant tumour to social well being of our societies
Social networks have improved interaction/communication and also stimulate prompt social gathering for positivity.
Africa needs to learn from the westernworld in the aspect of technology and economic development.
Most US citizens re intelligent and they reason ahead of time.
@albertjackchat I think 100% voting system is not too good because people vote base on tribal n religious affiliation not for competency.
Under developed communities will grow if they embrace morality.
Is there something wrong with modern medical technology? The more advanced technology, the more less improved health.
Science has not improve the health of people. Before now people use to live long, trek distance places n do heavy physical job.
Ministry of health is the list improved ministry. Diabetes, cancer, HIV and other diseases so wide spread and reduced long life.
Take Twitter with you https://t.co/X70c864mEU via @twitter
Evidence of good health system is increased life span, increased good health n reduced diseases. But this is not what it is.
The more the advancement in medical sciences, the more reduced life span n increased health problem. People re no longer strong to trek
There is a need for professional right law. The law shall give equity/equality to all profession. No profession shall be superior  to others
Cosmetic surgery should only be allowed for pathological condition not physiological condition.
I love you all.

It is unfortunate that Africans has little or no contribution to the world technology n advancement.

@IAMJHUD That`s great.
Try tradocracy today. Tradocracy is defined as a four arms system of govt meant for the well being of people. It is a new system of govt.
Electoral competition is free to all citizens from the point of registration, campaign n advertisement in tradocratic system of govt.
Electoral competition is not only meant for the middle class or the rich alone. So money tagged for electoral competition should be dropped.
Electoral contest must be free for all citizens. This gives equity n equality to all citizens. Education is free in some countries,
Money tagged for electoral competition gives room for mediocres n questionable characters into political power.
Money tagged for electoral competition prevents majority of citizens from contesting for political positions.
Good morning to all my followers.
@cnni Iraq withdrawal not a mistake, good for US and the world.
Political race should not be misguided to be arms race or military warfare with the emergence of partisan politics
Wisdom, knowledge, endurance n moral uprightness re all we need to move on in politics.
We need lasting peace in the world. Peace comes by trowing away religious differences, cultural differences n personal interest.
We should always stop thinking about what was or what could have be, but what is n what could be. Looking ahead of time, time heals.
It is unfortunate that Africans have no ideas of their own, starting from educational ideas, technological, political, economical ideas, etc
The greatest power is knowledge. One may acquire power with out knowledge such as military power, money power n govt power.
Africa has little or no contribution to the world techn n development. Most ideas of today Africans re western tutored ideas n philosophies
There is need to look into the basic facts about tradocracy as an alternative and a better system of government to democracy.
The fact is, in democratic system there is always partisan politics, rigging of election n govt shut down which is unhealthy to the people.
Personal interest should not be selfish driven interest, but general interest should be above personal interest when in govt. Try tradocracy
USA is great today because the founding fathers, were intelligent, creative and moral in their conduct.
@aligthebaptist I have developed a new system of government called TRADOCRACY. As democracy is 3 arms, tradocracy is 4 arms system of govt.

Money tagged for electoral competition gives room for mediocre s into political power. Electoral contest must free for all.
Money tagged for electoral competition prevents more n capable candidates from not contesting for political positions.
USA should restructure her democracy to prevent shut down of govt, partisan politics n equality in electoral contest.
I love USA, but I am not happy a bout the partisan politics and government shut down.
Once a candidate for election is elected, the candidate is for govt not for the party. Do not bring party issues into govt,but people issues
Good evening to all my following
Government should be for all not indirectly or directly for selected few just because of financial class difference.
In most parts of the world only the rich or middle class contest for bigger political positions. What happens to poor and others?
Greetings all the following and followers
Not just protecting persona interest all the time. Protecting personal interest brings partisan politics and conflicts around the world.
Let make the world a better place for all, no matter  who are and where you come from. One should learn to protect interest of everybody.
People should learn to respect societal values n norms. Avoid break down of morality. Acceptance of gay means nothing right n nothg is wrong
You can not always marry who you love all the time. You can not love your mother or your dog and marry them. Gay marriage lowers humans.
In the name of basic right, people might soon be advocating for marriage of human beings with animals. Not all basic right is moral.
Marriage is the union of man and woman for the so purpose of procreation through their sex organs. Gay marriage falls short of this.
Tradocracy shall be the best system of government based on current trend.
Tradocratic system of government does not allow partisan politics and government shut down.
