Talked to @cbschicago about the @Amtrak system failure at Union Station this week. I’ll be meeting with CEO Anderson to oversee the action plans they are putting in place to make sure this doesn’t happen again. https://t.co/eQsGyaV0HL
.@Amtrak's apology for the unacceptable problems they caused for @Metra passengers yesterday is only a start. There are many questions Amtrak needs to answer and then fixes need to be made as soon as possible.  I have called CEO Anderson to my office for another meeting next week https://t.co/9jaB0nk9jx
The Senate approved @EPA chief Wheeler today. I wrote to him this week telling him he should use his authority under the Clean Air Act to protect the public from endangerment resulting from @sterigenics1's EtO emissions. Citizens need to be protected if Sterigenics wins in court.
I will be calling the CEO into my office once again to tell him that @Amtrak cannot let this happen again. They have not moved fast enough on fixing rail problems at Union Station.
I sympathize w/ everyone who experienced delays on @metraBNSF this morning. I was told they are the result of Amtrak-owned switching issues in the Union Station system. I met w/ @Amtrak CEO 3 weeks ago &amp; talked about need for a lot of work on rail, platform &amp; other infrastructure
Our government was set up to give power to the American people by giving power to Congress. That's why I'm an original co-sponsor of this resolution to claw back power from the Executive Branch.  We need this legislation to give power back to the people. https://t.co/sODIIuyvwE

Encouraged by today’s hearing where a federal judge denied @Sterigenics1’s motion to lift the @ILEPA’s ban on using EtO at its Willowbrook facilities. IL EPA cited alarming health risks. More to come but a positive development.  https://t.co/TAuApoTEtC
We have a great team researching #AI in the US, but we don’t yet have a plan for its use. My Growing Artificial Intelligence Through Research (GrAITR) Act proposes to address that by investing $1.6B in AI research over 10 yrs. I wrote about it in @thehill. https://t.co/yeUZVTkqmm
@ak_potter The best way is to contact my DC office. Very sorry about the difficulties you've been having. (202) 225 - 5701
The evidence already collected indicating high levels of EtO in the air in Willowbrook seems to clearly demonstrate a public health threat. The US EPA needs to act immediately. I applaud the @ILEPA’s actions on Sterigenics, now it’s time for US @epa to follow suit.
As Sterigenics fights their battle in court, I'll continue to fight to get the US EPA to act. Under the Clean Air Act, @EPA has the ability to temporarily shut down any facility for 60 days if there is evidence that it presents a substantial threat to public health or environment
After Friday’s @ILEPA order to shut down EtO sterilization at @Sterigenics1, I wish I could say our work is done, but we know that’s not the case. Sterigenics’ attorneys have already indicated they will fight the IL EPA’s Seal Order in court. https://t.co/awzbNsItKO
#Climatechange is a growing threat &amp; we must work on bipartisan solutions to mitigate &amp; solve it. The Energy Innovation &amp; Carbon Dividend Act I'm co-sponsoring would price carbon and return 100% of the net revenue as a rebate to American families. https://t.co/A3xuyD5y57

I base this call on the air testing EPA has already conducted and made this clear to Sterigenics executives when we met last week.
This story makes several allegations that, if confirmed, are incredibly disturbing. I will continue to hold @Sterigenics1 accountable and will not relent in calling for the @EPA to shut down the plant unless they can prove that it is not a health threat. https://t.co/BlKyWN2lWW

The only way I’ll back off calling for an EPA shut down is if such testing is conducted and it backs their claim.  They have not moved forward on this. Today I reiterated this. 4 of 4
Six weeks ago I told Sterigenics they should begin perimeter testing as the only way to prove their claim they are not emitting a significant amount of EtO into the community. 3 of 4
. @epa has not heeded my request to shut down Sterigenics based on EPA air tests that indicated high level of ethylene oxide in Willowbrook. 2 of 4
Today I met w @Sterigenics1’s CEO &amp; president &amp; requested that they host a public meeting w/ impacted residents ASAP. They did not indicate a willingness to do so at this time. 1 of 4 https://t.co/X51pXMof9u

@LOYURGRL @N4EJchicago @StopEtOLC @Sterigenics1 @StopSterigenics @CleanAirIL I completely understand. I should have provided more context in my original tweet. I am very sorry for what everyone who lives near Sterigenics has been going through and can assure you I am on your side.
Sterigenics continues to make the claim that the high EtO readings in Willowbrook are not caused by their plants. That’s why I challenged Sterigenics to back up their claim with real data that could come from perimeter testing. So far they’ve done nothing.
@mr_sj_stanczak @Sterigenics1 Give us the data to convince EPA to shut it down
@N4EJchicago @LOYURGRL @StopEtOLC @Sterigenics1 @StopSterigenics @CleanAirIL Please see my clarifying response to initial tweet. I will provide more info after today’s meeting
@jen_mcconahy @Sterigenics1 @EPA @CleanAirIL @StopSterigenics @StopEtOLC Still calling for the shutdown. See my clarifying response to initial tweet
Perimeter testing could provide even more evidence that Sterigenics is not safe, and perhaps finally convince EPA to shut it down. That is why I’m calling for it.
I want to clarify that my call for Sterigenics to test the air around their perimeter does not change my position that they need to shut down unless and until they can demonstrate that they are safe.

The govt #shutdown is having real-world impacts not just on federal employees but the many who depend on services. Ridiculous that we are on path towards longest shutdown ever 1/2
A TX judge struck down the entire #ACA &amp; @POTUS is failing to defend the law in court. I voted today in favor of House of Reps defending the ACA in court so we can maintain coverage for individuals with preexisting conditions &amp; rein in insurers
Here's an interview I did last month about the rules changes my colleagues &amp; I in the Problems Solvers Caucus fought for to break the gridlock in #DC. The House approved some of them last week on a bipartisan vote. I’m optimistic about further progress. https://t.co/5CzIabuCjy

Today I used my old friend “Bill” from Schoolhouse Rock to illustrate the need to reform House rules so Congress can work more efficiently for the people. I’m proud that pieces of a bill @RepLaHood &amp; I introduced to help achieve that have been approved. https://t.co/B32m3OaPxX

The model should also be considered for all drug purchases through Medicare.  I am hopeful that the new Democratic House majority will make progress in reining in sky-high prescription drug prices for all Americans.
This law would require the government to negotiate w drug manufacturers for lower prices. I also support Medicare's move to institute the IPI Model to lower costs for MD-administered drugs by resetting Medicare payments based on international prices and introducing competition.
An article in today’s WSJ shows that price increases on prescription drugs, including generics, continue to outpace inflation. That’s why I continue to fight for lower drug prices. In the new Congress I will help introduce the Medicare Prescription Drug Price Negotiation Act https://t.co/i2OSsjoYLP

so we can have a better picture of the pollution levels crossing its property boundary and present clear and convincing evidence to EPA regarding its decision on Sterigenics’ fate.
I continue to stand by my statement that Sterigenics should close until we’re assured it’s not a public health threat. Because EPA won't shut Sterigenics (which they have the authority to do), &amp; because the company won't shut itself down, I'm calling for new EtO testing methods
We learned from today's @EPA webinar that new results for EtO testing conducted on 11/23 in Willowbrook differ from previous results, but only raise more questions &amp; cannot be said to demonstrate that @Sterigenics1 is not a public health threat. https://t.co/L3JV4SrFtR
Please take a moment today to honor @chicago_police officers Conrad Gary and Eduardo Marmolejo, who lost their lives in the line of duty in a tragic train accident. The officers’ heroic actions pursuing an armed suspect cost them their lives. My condolences to their families. RIP

The #ACA needs to be improved, not eliminated. I will continue to work in this new Congress to give Americans better access to affordable health care.
Congress must act to counter the judicial elimination of the #ACA. It is completely unacceptable to pull the rug out from so many relying on law for health care coverage. I’ve cosponsored legislation so the House can defend the ACA in court appeals since #POTUS refused to do so.

We can’t afford any more delay, which is why I’m pressuring the @EPA to update the standard as soon as possible.
The EPA’s estimate of cancer risk from ethylene oxide recently increased by 30 times, but the current emissions standard, set in 2006, doesn’t take the new risk into account. When they update the standard, they will almost certainly require tighter emissions controls.
The @EPA was required by law to update its #emissions standard for #ethyleneoxide emissions from commercial sterilizers like #Sterigenics four years ago. They don’t currently have any publicly available plans to do so. This is unacceptable and threatens public #health.

With the #health and #safety of their families at stake, all area residents should be able to review this critical information in a format they can understand.
I also requested that the #ATSDR work with the EPA to produce a non-technical summary of the new assessment to be released at the same time as the new health assessment. There was no plain language summary accompanying the earlier public health assessment, which led to confusion.
Today I sent a letter to the #ATSDR, who produced an earlier assessment showing elevated risk, asking them to do a follow-up assessment once the new data has been collected. The @EPA has said it's not planning on doing this.
While I’m glad the @EPA has responded to my request and committed to a new round of air testing around the #Sterigenics facility in #Willowbrook, this is not enough. We also need a new public health assessment to let us know whether the facility still poses a cancer risk.

The health, safety, and overall quality of life of the large population of people that live, work, and go to school near #Sterigenics must come first.
That’s why I’m asking the @EPA to take action now to assess the degree of the health risk and shut down the facility if necessary. I am also asking that ethylene oxide monitors be installed that can detect harmful levels and warn the public in the future.
Although #Sterigenics has followed state and federal laws, we now know that these laws are insufficient to protect the public’s health. This is an example of regulations not keeping up with science.
Looking at the map showing the increased cancer risks faced by people who live around this plant not only in #Willowbrook, but in #IndianHeadPark, #BurrRidge, #WesternSprings, #Hinsdale, #Darien, #Countryside, #LaGrange, and #Westmont is frightening.
In a new letter to @EPAAWheeler, I'm calling for immediate action by the agency to demonstrate that the emissions from the plant are no longer a threat to public health or use its authority under Section 303 of the Clean Air Act to shut down the plant.

This has resulted in a Congress that doesn’t work and is frozen in partisan #gridlock, allowing the president and the courts to grab the power that is supposed to be held by the #American people.
Our #Constitution empowered the American people by empowering #Congress and their representatives. But congressional rules are now rigged in a way that greatly diminishes our ability to represent our constituents.
Today we honor all the hard-working Americans that have built our great nation and the labor movement that has fought for better hours, wages, and working conditions. Stay safe and have a great #LaborDay!
The Northwest Homer Fire and Ambulance Protection District, which serves an area that includes #HomerGlen, #HomerTownship, #Lockport, #Lemont, and #LemontTownship, has been awarded a nearly $324 thousand grant through @DHSgov to help with hiring expenses. https://t.co/mrSe9Zr2E7

@Metra conveyed that they understand our expectations and are working with BNSF, the operator of the line, to meet them. Not only as a representative of thousands of people who ride the BNSF line daily but also as a user of this line, the only acceptable solution here is results.
Earlier today, I talked with @Metra leadership to better understand what went wrong yesterday. But I also raised issues of delays, A/C problems, schedule changes, and other problems that have impacted the line, and I said that all these issues must be resolved. @metraBNSF

It also says that a #specialcounsel must be provided written notice that specifies the reason for removal and that they may challenge the removal in court.
Congress needs to take up and pass the Special Counsel Independence and Integrity Act, H.R. 5476, which states that a #specialcounsel may only be removed at the direction of the #AttorneyGeneral and only for good cause.
At this time, it is imperative that the #SpecialCounsel investigation be allowed to reach its conclusion without interruption or threat of interruption.

Congress' official tax analysts say #Republican #taxbill will add over $1 trillion to debt over 10 years even with increased economic growth. We were promised the #taxcuts would not increase debt. Another reason this bill should be stopped. Let's do real #middleclass #taxreform.
We must create a workplace environment where everyone feels safe, and must ensure that any actions inconsistent with our values are met with consequences, no matter who the offender is. https://t.co/GQGVuvSnfd
I am joining my colleagues to formally ask the @FCC to delay consideration of its #netneutrality rollback and remove it from the December agenda.  I will continue to work with my peers and interested stakeholders on other actions to maintain an open #internet.
The pace that the Republican #taxbill is moving through #Congress is reckless.  With so much at stake for all Americans and red flags about how #middleclass families could be impacted by this legislation, let’s slow down and get this right.
We need a fair and open #internet.  Internet service providers should not be allowed to block or throttle content.  I’m disturbed by the upcoming @FCC vote to roll back current #netneutrality protections and I am working with my colleagues on actions to maintain an open internet.
There was a packed house today at my final Senior Fair of the month.  Thanks to everyone who came to the event at the #OakLawn #VFW.  If you weren’t able to make it to any of my fairs over the past month, you can always call or stop by one of my offices. https://t.co/IZNhlWJpjB

The #databreach that @Uber covered up, like so many others, harmed #consumers and resulted in few consequences.  I'm cosponsoring HR 3975, the Cyber Breach Notification Act, which requires companies to notify customers of a breach and imposes penalties if they do not.
@FCC is planning to announce its plan today to repeal #NetNeutrality rules, enabling #internet companies to block and throttle content if they choose.  I am strongly opposing this rollback.  All #Americans deserve a free and open internet.  https://t.co/tInZjYTh1U

U.S. Steel released toxic chromium into #LakeMichigan for the second time this year, within 20 miles of a #Chicago drinking water intake.  The water remains safe to drink, but this can't happen again.  They must upgrade all wastewater treatment opertations.
@USDOT is launching its redesigned #airline #consumer website.  This is a good first step, but #Congress needs to pass my #AirlineConsumerProtectionAct, which requires airlines to provide better service, accommodations, and guarantees of timely arrival for all passengers.

Americans need real #taxreform that helps the #middleclass, fixes the fund that provides federal dollars for roads and public transit, and doesn’t add to our federal debt.  The House GOP bill fails on all of the above.

It appears that another effort will be made as soon as tomorrow to pass the #FastTrack #trade bill in the #House.
Weiss has also produced over 20 feature films and TV series, including my #favoritefilmofalltime, #TheBluesBrothers

We should protect America's #middleclass and stop #FastTrack now!
There is nothing to stop #currencymanipulation and nothing to protect #BuyAmerican laws
I have read the #TPP, at least the parts they will let me see, and I know it’s a #baddeal
Manufacturers know #TPP is an #Americanjobkiller. We cannot let any more bad #trade deals kill American #manufacturing #jobs.
When I talk to #manufacturers from my district, they tell me that #TPP is going to hurt #American manufacturing
Despite what you may be hearing elsewhere, this is not a #labor vs. #business issue

I will continue to pray for his soul, for his family, and for all who were close to him.
He was truly a remarkable man and a great shepherd. One week ago I had the opportunity to once again thank him for all he had done.
I always admired his straightforwardness. I will never forget the time he spent with my wife Judy and me two years ago in Rome.
Every time I heard him speak I learned something that enriched my mind and my faith
He was an intellectual powerhouse who had a special ability to communicate great truths in a simple manner
On a personal level, the more that I had the opportunity to get to know Cardinal George the more I admired him
And he was always extremely committed to social justice that reaches to all corners of our society
He convened inter-religious discussions and showed tremendous respect for other faith communities
His outreach went beyond the Catholic community
From his days as a teacher to his time as Archbishop of Chicago, he gave his all to spread God’s word and God’s love
He overcame many personal challenges, from polio at age 13 to the cancer that took his life, but he always persevered and kept giving
and a man who cared deeply about everyone no matter their faith
Not just Chicago Catholics but the world has lost a man who was a great leader in the Catholic Church
I am saddened to learn of the death today of Francis Cardinal George.

Let us remember all those who sacrificed to make #freedom possible for others.
It reminds me that it is critical for our nation to continue to stand up for #freedom as a human right, even when there is a cost.
I will never forget the experience of watching people unexpectedly taste #freedom , some for the first time.
I had the opportunity to watch East Germans freely make the cross-border journey that one week beforehand would have resulted in death.
I was in #Berlin six days after the wall came down.
The wall was a real manifestation of the Iron Curtain that imprisoned hundreds of millions of people and threatened the rest of the world.
