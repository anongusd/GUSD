Virginia is turning into that "assholes" scene from Spaceballs.
1998: Barna Research - I can't believe I remembered the name but it was my first paycheck job. This was a telephone survey company. They'd get contracts to run customer satisfaction surveys via the telephone. The products were usually illustrated Bibles. This is how it was.
1998: Century Theaters! What kid wouldn't want to work in a theater? Me after about 6 months. Saw a giant possum in the trash compactor. Let him have the dumpster area for the day; threw rocks at the orchard for 40 minutes and clocked out.
1998-2000: Remember Long's Drugs? I do because it was my high school job. My dad was in upper management so I was pretty much able to do whatever I wanted. However, I did work around 35 hours a week and learned how to process film and hate people who need pictures in an hour.
2000-2003ish: Customer service rep for early cam girl site. Again, these people are consumers with legitimate consumer complaints. You try streaming live audio and video over a 56k connection via AOL web service. you'd want to talk to someone too!
A hazy time in early 2000's: I worked at the Gap for 2 months?
2004: Retail Management. Adult Novelty Retail Management. What they need management too? Currently telecommuting as a customer service rep for this company. What? They have customers with serious questions.
2013: stay at home dad. Cloth diaper washer. Bottle warmer. Park goer. Story time. Cooker. Cleaner. Chauffeur. Keeper of routines and time. Memorized floor plan of @MontereyAq: can track 5 kids in open sea exhibit.
August 2017: Airbnb CoHost. Wow property owners need caretakers in busy tourist town. Seaside is totally a tourist town, it‚Äôs by the sea? Common people. First gig job, started to see the appeal. Still doin this? Yes.
October 2018: rideshare driving. Participating in pyramid scheme while exploring the city. Pays same as office job: same amount of sitting. Tax hassles. Also rain. But overall, unsoulsucking. Still doing this? Yes.
January-January 2019: cashier at local CBD/marijuana delivery service. Coolest thing was the title. Made 3 sales on a Saturday afternoon, in 8 hours. Gave me all the safe combos and passwords within 2 hours. Um, guys?
January 2019: office manager @ local coffee roasters. Applied for barista position, so? Staring at walls is about as fun as I remember.
