@JasonEDowneyLaw Jason you are exactly right about if POTUS had endorsed Casey. All I’m doing is pointing out it’s not sincere it’s a political favor. That’s all! I love DJT and VP Pence and anybody would love their support. It was a slick political move that’s all!
@consrvtveindian @POTUS @realDonaldTrump Just stating facts. Truth hurts
@NeilWolin Neil, I may be a dummy but I’ve been doing this long enough to smell a rat so to speak. You’ll learn one day😊
I’m betting President Trump wouldn’t know his pick for Georgia Governor if he got in a cab with him or pick him out of a 2 person photo line up! Makes you wonder were it came from🤔

@maanandshelly @RajAnand1953 Sorry about the ulcer😞. Did it start when BHO started separating families at the border?
@thylnvrfndmenow @maanandshelly @RajAnand1953 I’m just asking a simple question. Who is organizing and funding the protest? I’m sure your paying your own way but not everyone can afford that kind of expense of just traveling around to find a protest. Do you put “protest” on WAZE?
@TheDailyLeft So you just happen to be driving around on your own dime and you just ran into some folks and said let’s go protest? Hard to believe
@maanandshelly @RajAnand1953 Did you and your Dad join the protest? If so was it by coincidence that hundreds of others just happened to be in neighborhood?

Repealing Title II gets the government out of the business of picking winners and losers.
Happening now: @FinancialCmte is debating my bill to repeal Title II of Dodd-Frank. Watch it here: https://t.co/24P1L3d2Yg
$21.3 billion in savings alone shows that any Member who is serious about fiscal and budget responsibility should vote yes on H.R. 4894.
Initial CBO estimates of this policy show repealing Title II results in significant savings of $21.3 billion over ten years.
The only thing OLA achieves is a shadow regulatory state that has a profound impact on our financial markets.
OLA w/in Title II creates a distorted market &amp; unnecessary option for the government to takeover a failing firm’s liquidation process.
H.R. 4894 should be supported not only for our constituents who pay taxes, but for the small community financial institutions we represent.

The President should have known that regulations regarding buying guns must come from legislation. Not by oral degree.
Not only does that President trample on the Second Amendment, he also didn’t seem to care about Article I either… You know… Congress.
Obama likes to remind us that they taught Constitutional law, sadly I have yet to encounter one who disregards the Constitution so regularly
The right of the people to keep &amp; bear arms shall not be infringed. But, I think our Founding Fathers spoke too plainly a certain President.

The EPA is another arm of the federal government looking to bully private citizens. This must end: https://t.co/yWGNrFIAsx
This morning I told the story of Mr. McKnight of Senoia, who nearly lost everything because of EPA. Watch it here: https://t.co/MEzQBQEmyo
I urge my colleagues to join me in holding the EPA accountable in any future accidents by supporting H.R. 3531, 3655, and 3699.
The EPA must pay for their mistakes the same way I would have to.
If I were to accidentally cause the same disaster, do you think that I would get off just saying “I’m sorry”?  Heck no.
My bills remove these legal loopholes for the EPA and force them to repay the federal government for any damages the EPA causes.
That’s why I introduced three bills over the last two months targeting the EPA’s lack of accountability.
The EPA should not be allowed to use legal loopholes, and cower behind exemptions at the cost of taxpayer dollars.
How can Americans trust a gov agency charged w/ protecting our environment, when the same agency is responsible 4 causing even more damage?

The EPA should be held liable for any additional damage they cause at a clean-up site, just as any other individual or company would be.
If a private company were responsible, there is no doubt the EPA would fine them out of house and home, and all the way to their graves.
How are the American people supposed to trust an agency charged with protecting our environment whey they instead only cause more damage?

Our communities came together to heal and we let terrorists across the globe know that evil will never prevail.
While the terrorists responsible for these attacks were trying to strike fear into our hearts, they instead united us.
14 years ago we lost thousands of our loved ones &amp; first responders. We were attacked again 3 years ago &amp; lost 4 Americans in Benghazi.

Read my statement on Former Sec. Clinton's decision to finally turn over her private server to the DOJ here --&gt; http://t.co/sXnBR3WAtE
...it’s about four Americans being killed in a foreign land, and the suspicious reasons behind why we were there in the first place.
But this investigation is not about Hilary Clinton or partisan politics... http://t.co/sXnBR3WAtE
... and her unwillingness to comply with document production shows her disregard for a transparent government.
Secretary Clinton chose ‘convenience’ and secrecy over our national security...
...but the IC Inspector General found that she did in fact exchange classified and sensitive information on her personal server.
Secretary Clinton also said numerous times that there were no classified documents either sent or received...
...and Secretary Clinton repeatedly turned down that request.
Chairman Gowdy &amp; the Select Committee have been asking for months for Secretary Clinton to turn the server to an independent third party...
It's about time. https://t.co/7OsFU1ve7C
... that could instead be used to reduce the federal deficit. http://t.co/Y6inZicxgG
for these radical environmental groups to continue suing the federal government and taking the American public’s tax dollars ...
By restricting the EPA from having the ability to pay attorneys fees, we can not only reduce federal spending, but also reduce the incentive
(3/3) ... the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act, and the Endangered Species Act. http://t.co/Y6inZicxgG
(2/3) that would block any taxpayer dollars from being used to pay legal fees under any settlement regarding any case arising under...
(1/3) I proposed an amendment to H.R. 2822, the Department of Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act...
(2/2) ... it is time that we all take a stand against the EPA.
(1/2) As the Clean Power Plan threatens to shut down our own coal producers and other alternative energy groups...
EPA has continued to show their lack of respect for the rule of law &amp; that is blatantly obvious with their finalized Clean Power Plan rules.

StDept owes the American people the truth &amp; it’s growing more concerning each day about how difficult it is to get it http://t.co/6TXagKKEDa
No one deserves the truth more than the American people. The non-compliance from the State Department must stop. http://t.co/J3zhVzC8Rh
(3/3) What is so damaging that they don’t want Congress or the American public to see.
(2/3) Why are they refusing to produce these emails? What are they hiding?
(1/3) Here are some additional questions for the Department:
We’ve been asking simple questions. We’ve been given no answers
First we moved a foot, then a yard, and now we have moved our position a mile.  But the Department hasn’t budged an inch.
Again, here we are, 2.5 months after we issued the subpoena &amp; 6 months after we first sent the letter - still no documents from the Dept.
We have prioritized dates of documents from 2 years down to 1 year and down to 3 months.
We have prioritized our subpoena from 10 names down to 4 names, and then again down to 3 names.
In addition, we have attempted on multiple occasions to direct the Department towards specific key documents that we are after.
Last month, we went so far as to put in writing 27 specific questions that the State Department needed to answer ab. fmr Secretary's emails.
Also during that meeting, there was no mention of her use of a private server.
It was during this meeting that the Committee learned that the State Department was not in possession of the former Secretary’s emails
When the Dept appeared for the meeting, they not only did not bring those subject matter experts with them &amp; could not answer these basic Qs
We asked the Dept to bring its technology expert &amp; records officer to a meeting to discuss how records were kept, retrieved, &amp; produced.
To help the Comte better understand the Department’s technical capabilities, or lack thereof, the Comte has taken several different steps.
The State Dept, however, has done little but talk about the breadth of the subpoena and their inability to adequately search for documents.
The Department’s response: it could not search for these documents.
The Comte continued to indicate that its priority was for the emails from the senior State Dept personnel that were first requested in Nov
This subpoena sought documents &amp; emails for the 10 senior Dept officials including Cheryl Mills, Jake Sullivan, Huma Abedin, and Susan Rice.
On March 4, 2015, the Committee issued a subpoena for the documents and emails first requested in November.
So, what was the @StateDept doing during the time that the former Secretary was going through her emails?
But, the @StateDept didn’t produce a single document to the Committee related to the remaining portions of the November request.
Remember, these are emails of which the State Department never possessed and didn’t have to look for.
On February 13, 2015, the Dept produced approximately 300 emails to &amp; from the former Secretary during her time as the head of the Dept
For the first time the Department produced 8 emails to or from former Secretary Clinton, became aware her private email account.
The review of these new documents was enlightening, both in what it disclosed and what it did not.
In an effort to expedite the Department’s fulfillment of these subpoenas, the Select Committee prioritized the subpoena requests.
When this Comte was formed 1 year ago, the State Dept had yet to fully comply with two outstanding subpoenas issued in 2013 by another Comte
...with slow to little to no action at all.
The Committee has issued letters, subpoenas, &amp; has threatened to hold and has held public compliance hearings...
Our investigation has uncovered new witnesses, new documents, and new facts related to the Benghazi terrorist attack.
BUT, we know this is not the complete universe of information held by the Executive Branch.
The Department of Justice and the Intelligence Community have also produced documents never before seen by Congress.
In addition, hundreds of pages of emails never before seen by Congress have been produced by the White House.
The @HouseBenghazi Cmte has reviewed 20,000+ pages of emails &amp; documents produced by the State Department never before released to Congress.
RT @cimarcos: House floor speeches on #Benghazi led by @RepWestmoreland starting now.
The @HouseBenghazi Committee was formed and has been directed by the House to conduct a complete investigation to find those answers.
The attacks raised serious questions regarding the U.S. presence in #Benghazi, Libya, &amp; for nearly 2 years, Congress has sought answers.
These attacks resulted in the deaths of 4 Americans: Sean Smith, Tyrone Woods, Glen Doherty and the U.S. Ambassador to Libya, Chris Stevens.
Nearly 3 years ago, on September 11-12, 2012, the United States facilities in #Benghazi, Libya were the target of terrorist attacks.
