@nacenta @davyimpact It’s usually covered by insurance here, but it depends on the insurance - mine recently changed and I was told it wouldn’t be covered under the new plan (due to a mis-read).

@pbuck Only thing that works for me is imetrex, pills if I catch it very early on (almost never do) so the injections it is most of the time. I swear by them.

@daveixd Right — imagine if Car2Go, Zipcar, ir rental companies did it — you manage your profile (online or in-car), and when accessing the vehicle it knows it’s your so your profile loads. That would be a solid service improvement.
@keekerdc Is that such a ridiculous thing to think of? Now I’m questioning my priorities!
Random thought / question: is there such a thing as vehicle interoperability for the operator / driver? 		I’d love to be able to take my preferences/profile from car to car and thus not have to adjust mirrors or find my fav radio station.

@alpha1beta That's one of the key differentiators between Project 100 and others in the space. We are not pushing to get anyone elected - we are giving women an equal platform. If they are progressive, they will be listed. /1
@alpha1beta Especially voters who are marginalized as human beings because of their gender, race, etc.
@alpha1beta That’s one take on it, the research that we performed showed us that voters want to identify with their representatives /1
@alpha1beta Michael, try checking out some of the profiles if you want to know about their pet programs or their biggest goals for running for office, that'll address your concern.

I am an immigrant, everything that Trump has said about us is inflammatory, deceitful, and racist.

@daveixd I can agree to that, I just don't know what that balance looks like, and would love to try to understand/be exposed to it.
@daveixd who is "them" in this case? I want to make sure I fully understand before replying.
@daveixd at the core, your note is that everyone should care (about customers) - and that resonates with everyone who does product work.
@daveixd what do you think is the right frame to ensure that customers and their interactions with products, are thought of and cared for?
@daveixd if you don't have someone at least tasked with it - even as a bullet point in their responsibilities, you risk no one doing it, imo
Finally looking through some of the photos from the wedding, @jmspool. Thank you!! &lt;3
