@donnabrazile @donnabrazile it was the phony dossier that led the FBI to think an investigation was warranted. FAKE NEWS! Wake up Brazieand Dems
@RepMattGaetz I'm surprised @RepMattGaetz , you know the Dems plan. They plan to impeach Trump, remove him from office. Win the next election with most socialist candidate, and then BUILD THE DAMN WALL as if it was their idea.		It will never work.
I hope @BetoORourke doesn't have a colonoscopy scheduled anytime in the near future.
@AdamSchiff Sorry @RepAdamSchiff my name is already on the list to convince Democrats to allow @POTUS to 	BUILD THE DAMN WALL!
@TomFitton @realDonaldTrump @JudicialWatch That's ok, we are approaching the end of the Mueller nonsense.
@replouiegohmert @realDonaldTrump Well said @replouiegohmert , @POTUS MUST STAND HIS GROUND. BUILD THE DAMN WALL!
@charliekirk11 @charliekirk11 you are not quite right. Not only liberals. Liberals AND morons. Oh wait, my apologies. That's redundant.
@thehill @davidhogg111 right now we are focusing on border security.
@thehill @NYCMayor I'm pretty sure most New Yorkers wake up in fear each day wondering if you can screw things up worse than you did the day before.
@MSNBC The death we are seeing is Americans being killed by illegal aliens. And people like @aoc are content to invite them in and protect them.
@SenSchumer @SpeakerPelosi watching your response to @POTUS tonight was like watching paint dry. Give up the fight. FUND THE DAMN WALL!	From now on, every American killed or raped or assaulted by illegal aliens is your responsibility.
@GovMikeHuckabee Ha ha! Definitely a hostage tape. The only things missing were the black ski masks and the electronically altered voices.
@chrislhayes Poor assumption you MSNBC hack. I have it recorded the speech and will watch it each night until @potus gets the funding for the wall.
@AOC In the words of @RepMaxineWaters "YOU ARE NOT WELCOME HERE ANYMORE"		Follow Me
@DLoesch Obama, Clinton, Biden, Schumer and many other Dems also voted for the wall. Please go talk to them and ask why.
@charliekirk11 They need to be reminded of something ex President Obama said. "ELECTIONS HAVE CONSEQUENCES." The consequence here is that they are now shown to be jokers. Plain and simple.
@AOC @AOC is a racist. What is even worse, is that she is favoring foreigners over Americans.
@charliekirk11 Thank you @GovRonDeSantis
@dbongino And for those who pray at night, the tell God hamana hamana hamana
@KamalaHarris @KamalaHarris you should go stay in the park until the wall is funded
@RepBillFoster You didn't hear the facts about innocent Americans killed by illegal aliens? Did you fall asleep? Not to worry, I suggest yo go watch again.
@SenSchumer @SpeakerPelosi 	BUILD THE DAMN WALL
@CalebJHull @KellyannePolls WAY TO GO MS. CONWAY!	Shut down the smart As!
@maziehirono @realDonaldTrump Yes Ms. Hirono, and as you observed recently, JUST SHUT UP.
@ChrisMurphyCT Ha! @ChrisMurphyCT your 35% is wrong. Much higher.	FAKE NEWS!
@AOC @RashidaTlaib Riding together? Ok, but I hope neither of you are driving. Driving under the influence of ignorance is a crime.
@brithume Worse than a simple lack of urgency, it's actually a lack of belief of the border crisis.
@CNN 6. @CNN bull s---	FAKE NEWS
@FoxNewsSunday @davidcicilline @davidcicilline of course she can say what she likes, but we can also call Dems and liberals names also. Is that the kind of discourse you want? I don't think so.
@AshaRangappa_ Actually no. The point is that he would wait until the left finally realized the importance of the wall. On the other hand, he will likely declare a state of emergency and have the wall built without congressional consent.
@sjcloobeck I think you are wrong Steve. It's been the most successful in terms of accomplishments as an presidency in recent memory.
@davidharsanyi Beyond that, she's simply a waste of space.
@KimStrassel When they get rolling, the wheels will come off.
@KamalaHarris Untrue @KamalaHarris . Please stop the crap. If the House would give money for the wall, the Senate and @potus would pass it and allow the govt to open. Do you people in Washington really think the American people are stupid enough to buy your crap over and over?
@thehill Very gentlemanly of you @Sen_JoeManchin , but really it's that loudmouth @RashidaTlaib who owes America an apology. She should be censured.
@bennyjohnson For what it's worth, I don't like the woman, but I actually enjoyed watching her dance.
@JudicialWatch @TomFitton @TomFitton you have my full support. Thank you for having our backs.
@GOP @PressSec @potus $54B for foreign aid? Ha! VETO that sucker!	$5B for the wall is what we need.	BUILD THE DAMN WALL!
@eviefordham @DailyCaller Yeah, I would distance myself from her as well; for any umber of reasons.
@mollyfprince @DailyCaller @DanCrenshawTX Scandalous and Ill conceived @AOC
@thehill If they wish to leave, then they had better do it, and decrease the surplus population....E. Scrooge
@thehill Yeah, and we don't have the power to make you and your party members stop calling @potus a mother f---er
@thehill Do what it takes @pouts . 	BUILD THE DAMN ALL!
@kaitlancollins You must take into account @kaitlancollins that @RashidaTlaib is a spineless coward.
@SusanLiTV @FoxNews @FoxBusiness Congratulations and best of luck @SusanLiTV
@thehill He got off too easy. Don't you think @BernieSanders  ?
@thehill @Sen_JoeManchin don't worry, I'm sure she does talk to her son that way.
@heyadiana you look adorable in the Santa hat
@kathygriffin  sorry to hear about your mom.	I hope no idiot out there sends you a picture of themself holding up a bloody likeness of your mom's head. Surely not. You are the only idiot who would do such a thing.
@MZHemingway This is disgusting.	Pardon Flynn now.
@rikkiratliff Close to what I always say.	I'd rather date an ass than a democrat.	Then I realized that I couldn't find a 	Democrat who is not an ass.
@thehill And bad theatre at that.
@Mediaite What a vulgar mother f---er!!	Wishing you into the corn field.
@AP_Politics Don't open the government until you 	Fund the $5B. 	BUILD THE DAMN WALL
@_waleedshahid Scared of the moron AOC? 	LAUGHABLE!
@JudicialWatch This is such nonsense.	Deport the illegals and BUILD THE DAMN WALL!
@LouDobbs @realDonaldTrump 2000 families? Give us a break. 	What we need is a bunch of those cannons they use at the circus to shoot the clown from one side of the big top to other. We could shoot the illegals back over the border.
@thehill What a waste of space @RashidaTlaib is.	She should be sanctioned.	And certainly owes @pouts an apology.
@ChadPergram What a waste of time! 	Dems, allocate the $5B.	Let @potus BUILD THE DAMN WALL!
@marklevinshow Come on @marklevinshow don't be so dismissive. @SpeakerPelosi  's ice cream eating habits are important in today's world. And a masterful piece of classic journalism on @cnn ' s part.
@JudicialWatch I’m sure it was a convenient way to hide her illegal activities
@LisaMarieBoothe @AOC Yes. @LisaMarieBoothe is correct. You are a great dancer. You should become a professional dancer. A FULL TIME professional dancer. PLEASE.
@CNN Yes...very unprofessional
@SenSchumer @realDonaldTrump Stop the nonsense @SenSchumer you know walls work. Give @POTUS the $5B . Let him BUILD THE DAMN WALL
@SpeakerPelosi @SenateGOP Please @SpeakerPelosi stop the nonsense. Give @POTUS the $5B.	Let him BUILD THE DAMN WALL
@charliekirk11 I agree Charlie.	1) Declare state of national emergency	2) BUILD THE DAMN WALL
@Jim_Jordan @jim_jordan shouldn’t @RashidaTlaib be sanctioned for her comments?
@townhallcom @JoyVBehar I also identify you with @RashidaTlaib . Both idiots.
@KamalaHarris Let’s end the shutdown when $5B is set aside for border protection.	BUILD THE DAMN WALL!
@MattPalumbo12 Thanks for that @MattPalumbo12 but why does no one attack her on police custody? Reps get called racist and sexist no matter what, so they may as well stick her when warranted.
@JudicialWatch @JudicialWatch please keep up the fight.	DRAIN THE SWAMP!
@RepMikeRogersAL @realDonaldTrump Hey @SpeakerPelosi &amp; @SenSchumer , give Trump the $5B and let him BUILD THE DAMN WALL!		(Follow me)
@DLoesch Makes sense to me.	We should arm a couple teachers in all schools.	As long as we do good background checks and know they are not prone to temper; or worse.
@ewarren @maddow @ewarren I think you should like for the Absolute Silence car
@ChrisMurphyCT Ha ha @ChrisMurphyCT who cares?
@PBReaderMan @FaceTheNation @senatemajldr I sleep like a baby. 	Thank you for asking.	And I suppose you voted for the 	criminal, obstructionist loser HRC.	I have pity for you.
@TomFitton @JudicialWatch Yes @TomFitton thank you and your team. I bet these non-existent voters somehow voted for Hillary.	DRAIN THE SWAMP!
@ByronYork @BretBaier @GreenvilleNews @TGowdySC thank you for your service.. Good luck to you.
@johncardillo Funny and angering as well.	Can they really be that stupid?	Oops. Silly question.
@FaceTheNation @senatemajldr A total non-starter and a total disgrace.	Get the $5B and BUILD THE DAMN WALL.
@SenBlumenthal @SenBlumenthal  a small delay in a couple's nuptials is a TINY price to pay for the improved security of our great nation.	It's appalling to me that you and those in your party don't see that.
@RepBobbyRush Yeah, for the worse.
@MikeBrestDC @DailyCaller @NancyPelosi The decision to shutdown was clearly on @potus .	But with every passing hour, @SenSchumer and @NancyPelosi are clearly responsible for its continuation.	Hand over the $5B and let Trump BUILD THE DAMN WALL!
@NancyPelosi @realDonaldTrump And you @NancyPelosi  supported the wall before.	And you @SenSchumer supported the wall before.	Even you @HillaryClinton supported the wall before.	Allocate the $5bil and let @POTUS 	BUILD THE DAMN WALL!
@dbongino Oh marvelous, now we have Pelosi's daughter threatening us.
@TheDemocrats WRONG! The Democrats should step up and join the Republicans in protecting our borders.	BUILD THE DAMN WALL!
@NancyPelosi @realDonaldTrump @potus wants funding for the wall. 	He has said that many times.	Why don't you understand that?	Are you as dumb as you look?
@Lena56279985 Happy New Year to you and yours @Lena56279985
@RepMattGaetz @gatewaypundit @RepMattGaetz please keep up the fight.	America First!	BUILD THAT WALL!
@RealSaavedra What a sick comparison!	Where do you come from @JerryBrownGov ? 	Please go back there.
@charliekirk11 No, I did not know that.	What the heck is wrong with @SenateDems ?	Thank God there are only 47 of them!	Oh no, I invoked the name of God.	What will the Dems say about that?
@AlanaKStewart @JeffFlake @MittRomney @AlanaKStewart I agree this sort of thing can hurt Reps, but I prefer individuals speaking up for their points of view versus the identity politics and group think crap the Dems  practice.
@Lawrence Yeah, yeah, let them run.	Both losers with no chance.
@MarshaBlackburn Happy New Year to you and yours @MarshaBlackburn
@Jim_Jordan What is @POTUS waiting for?
@RealJamesWoods @dbongino It is my sincere hope that bum  @JohnBrennan  sees some personal jail time for his role in the conspiracy to frame @potus
@CNN @ProfKori @CNNOpinion Actually @CNN, as dual, you got it wrong.	The secret is really no secret.	Anyone who would vote on someone else 	would be accused of being a racist.
@thehill Don't give in @POTUS  veto that sucker.	BUILD THAT WALL!
@DiamondandSilk Illegal aliens trying to buy guns?	Say it ain't so. I guess these are 	the very law-abiding folks the 	left keep telling us about.	Bull S---!
@townhallcom Actually, @HillaryClinton , 2018 was a quite bright year, except for your lasting-forever excuses tour.
@SenatorRisch Happy New Year to you and yours @SenatorRisch
@Sharronrose123 Happy New a Year Miss Sharon
@KamalaHarris @KamalaHarris but are you really going to spend effort and time working on those things? Or will you waste all your time and taxpayer dollars on the many investigations you and your friends in the other chamber keep talking about?
@RepBillJohnson Happy New Year to you and yours @RepBillJohnson
@senorrinhatch Thank you for your honorable service @senorrinhatch
@senorrinhatch Happy New Year to you and yours @senorrinhatch
@MikeCrapo @SenatorRisch Happy New Year to you and yours @MikeCrapo
@SenatorBurr Yeah, ok, but I hope you won't give up on active investigations.
@politico It's much too late to think about that.	Pocahontas is clearly too unlikeable	to be taken seriously.
@thehill First, why is this not enough to have her stripped of her license? Second, think we should make sure that Kollab gets the wrong medicines for the rest of her life.
@Jim_Jordan Happy New Year to you and yours.
@BernieSanders Happy New Year @BernieSanders
@johncardillo @HeyTammyBruce @CNN Yeah, these two are major embarrassments as newsmen.	But what the hell @CNN is a major embarrassment as a news network.
@SenCoryGardner Happy New Year to you and yours @SenCoryGardner
@ShannonBream You'll love it. 	Happy New Year Shannon.
@ladeedafalala @JaneCurtain exactly how are you going to make sure of that?
@MariaBartiromo Don't worry Maria, I have not forgotten. I hope someone rolls for that.	HAPPY NEW YEAR to you and yours.
@boblatta Happy New a Year to you and yours @boblatta
@henryrodgersdc @DailyCaller @NancyPelosi @SenSchumer What a WASTE OF TIME. You need to compromise. Isn't that what all of you lawmakers are always preaching.	GIVE THE $5BIL. BUILD THAT WALL!
@politico I'm confused, diversity SHOULD refer to views of multiple social groups, genders, age groups, etc. It seems that when the Dems use the term, they are referring to diverse intelligence levels. Sad.
@donnabrazile Be careful @donnabrazile , let's leave religion out of this. Religion in Government is a bad thing. Isn't it?
@TIA_EWING Happy New Year to you and yours
@DailyCaller Another sickeningly snowflake political move by the FAKE NEWS HEADQUARTERS @CNN
@AOC Too bad it won't pass.
@TimPeebles @SharylAttkisson Did Trump tell you that Tim?	Surely not.	You're just more FAKE NEWS.	@dbongino
@SenRonJohnson @SenRonJohnson Happy New Year to you and yours.
@KristySwansonXO Even better, the frogs don't pay for the service.
@JessicaDitto45 @IvankaTrump @WHNSC @StateDept Please make sure you don't cancel if there are too many white women. There seems to be a lot of that going around.
@thecjpearson @AnnCoulter @realDonaldTrump It's unclear whether the Dems don't care about border security, or more likely, they are just too damn stupid to understand that a border wall is the first, best step toward border security.	BUILD THAT WALL!		Please retweet me.
@greggutfeld @greggutfeld I agree but on the other hand, who cares one way or the other, what @kathygriffin has to say
@GOPChairwoman @AnnCoulter @RepJeffries should be ashamed of himself.	I know I'm embarrassed that a member of our House actually feels that way. What a waste!	BUILD THAT WELL!
@greggutfeld This whole thing is quite troubling.
@lukerosiak @DailyCaller If true, the Black Caucus should be ashamed and should be publicly embarrassed. If untrue, may a hex be placed on @lukerosiak.
@EricTrump @LaraLeaTrump Happy New Year to you 	and yours Mr. Trump.
@thehill The FAKE NEWS journalists should have been excluded.	They don't deserve to be honored.
@CNN 3 biggest risks to America	1) Open borders	2) Democrats	3) FAKE NEWS
@GOPLeader @POTUS Don't give in on the $5Bil. 	BUILD THAT WALL!
@JudicialWatch I don't know about the House rules, but @RepMaxineWaters definitely is working on inciting violence. Commence the investigation.
@SoniHorta @SteveScalise They are doing a great job.	Of course, there are no figures for the terrorists who got through and did not get caught. Also, the wall is safer than having to chase and capture the criminals.	BUILD THAT WALL!
@CNN More waste of time and money.	Not just the damn investigations, but the salaries of these folks as well.
@RealJamesWoods @NancyPelosi @SenSchumer They can't tweet their own sentiments because they don't HAVE their own sentiments.
@KamalaHarris Actually, @KamalaHarris your salary is a waste of taxpayer money.
@henryrodgersdc @DailyCaller Aww, come on @GOPChairwoman , Pocahontas is not a total fraud. She said she is Cherokee and science has proven that she is 1 / 1,024th Cherokee. 	Give her a break.
@Lawrence Ha! I don't really think @SenWarren Pocahontas will be a contender for anything.
@TheJordanRachel @SebGorka UNBELIEVABLE.
@marklutchman @RealCandaceO Total inclusion in today's America?	What a concept!
@townhallcom Medieval? 	You can't really believe that.	Walls don't work?	Can you really be that dumb?	How silly of me. Of course you can.
@JudicialWatch @TomFitton Is this the insurance policy?
@megarr98 @RepMarkMeadows Yes, and it was not said tha Mexico would pay for the wall up front. Only that it would pay. Which it will.	Happy New Year to you.
@JudicialWatch Do you have a problem with taking in murderers, rapists, smugglers, prostitutes and human traffickers?	RACIST!
@JudicialWatch Please keep fighting for us @JudicialWatch
@SebGorka FlakeBook strikes again!
@AnnCoulter Yes @AnnCoulter , and what's worse is they continue doing it.
@TiffanyDCross @AliVelshi What a waste of airtime.	Perhaps I'll watch Wren and Stimpy.
@RepBobbyRush Good luck Rep Rush.	Rush the bills through as you wish.	But if you ignore funding for the wall, 	it won't be succesful.	BUILD THE WALL!!
@RepMarkMeadows Thanks a lot High Tax High Crime Pelosi?	What a waste of space!!
@megarr98 @RepMarkMeadows Mexico is paying for it already with the USMCA.	I guess Dems and snowflakes want to ignore that.
@SebGorka @CNN My heart bleeds for the offended witches.
@RealCandaceO @SenWarren Ha ha @RealCandaceO and what is worse is that the Dems will tell us all how wonderful it is that a Native American can actually become President.
@dbongino Yeah @dbongino but unfortunately the world in general and the Dems and the left specifically are not short of imbeciles.
@ericbolling @realDonaldTrump @SenSchumer That's exactly right. Mexico HAS already paid for the wall, but the dopey Dems won't admit that. 	BUILD THE WALL!!
@trish_regan I think @ewarren @SenWarren was at a ritual rain dance the day they taught that economics lesson in college.
@AdamParkhomenko @RepCohen You know, the White House doesn't HAVE to hold a briefing.
@RealJamesWoods @KamalaHarris @NancyPelosi @JerryBrownGov @AdamSchiff @tedlieu @SenFeinstein @KamalaHarris, @NancyPelosi, @JerryBrownGov, @AdamSchiff , @tedlieu, @SenFeinstein...	Yeah, I think a cat their tongue.
@JudicialWatch I love this one. She claims someone else signed all those documents with her name. If she is lying, lock her up. If not, lock up the forger.
@brithume @BretBaier RACISTS!!
@larryelder @SebGorka EUREKA! The women's march organizers are RACIST: even to the exclusion of the sex they want to advance. Ha ha ha ha.
@TheDemocrats INCLUSION you say?	From my vantage point, the Dems choose to EXCLUDE viewpoints that do not match theirs.
@BridgetPhetasy @benshapiro Those 41 % of Americans questioned are not only ignorant, but worse, they are fully content to be so.
@charliekirk11 Hey Mr. Kirk, very interesting and quite troubling.
@CNN @POTUS and others have been saying that 	for a while now. @CNN do you call this news?
@KamalaHarris Ok. Work on reforming the bail system. But when that same pregnant mother is convicted of that crime, she goes to jail just as if she were a man.
@maziehirono @maziehirono , no, I think it's time for to just SHUT UP! like you told us men to do whil you trying to hi-jack Cavanaugh with no evidence
@KamalaHarris They also did not sign up as pawns to your cheap political tricks.	BUILD THE WALL!
@CBSNews @LindseyGrahamSC @LindseyGrahamSC thank you for keeping your principles and I'm glad you are now in agreement with @POTUS
@dcexaminer The intolerance of @maziehirono and @KamalaHarris is unfortunate. Do they understand what freedom of religion means? My apologies; obviously they do not.
@TheRevAl Good life to you Marcus Al. Here's hoping you don't follow in your grandfather's footsteps.
@KamalaHarris Another Dem asking for fighting and violence. Sickening.
@charliekirk11 Because we are stupid. Stop giving that aid now and use that money for the wall. Mexico would then be paying for the wall.
@charliekirk11 @IngrahamAngle I've been saying that, too. But when does no one take it seriously?
@JaniceDean I don't know. I hope God is not a Democrat. You know how intolerant they can be.
@RepKClark Did you actually HEAR the temper tantrum? Did anyone? Perhaps there was no tantrum at all. Instead, President Trump is acting on his beliefs and promises.	Perhaps you should get a job with CNN. FAKE NEWS.
@TomFitton @realDonaldTrump We're counting on you @TomFitton  to call out the abuse
@CNNSitRoom @CNN @JeffFlake @Acosta Ha ha, the only thing funnier than thinking @JeffFlake would have a chance at defeating @POTUS  is thinking @Acosta would have the same chance
@TomFitton @JudicialWatch Unfortunately, no one knows how many. What we do know is that for Dems, it's not yet enough.
@JudicialWatch Thanks Obama.
@realDonaldTrump If the texts cannot be recovered, I certainly hope some heads will roll for this obstruction.
@GovMikeHuckabee Imagine that, a Republican.	Congratulations @PressSec and @GovMikeHuckabee
@SenSchumer @CuseFootball Hey, Cryin' Chuck, Syracuse football is not as important as working to end the shutdown.	Thanks for caring, Chuck.
@CNNTonight @CNN @donlemon That is very correct Mr. Lemon. Unfortunately, President Trump seems to be the only person in Washington. Please practice honest journalism and ask your fellow Dems to get back to Washington and do their job.
@DailyCaller Thanks for the hard work trying to negotiate an end to the shutdown stalemate, Ms. Pelosi. 	WHAT A WASTE!!
@wuerker @hughhewitt @HallieJackson @MeetThePress @realDonaldTrump I wonder Mr. Wuerker, if you are right, then how do all of those illegal aliens (I did not say the undocumenteds) get into the US? Oh wait, I know, they walked across the border.
@JudicialWatch ABSOLUTELY! 	Telling people to 'get in their face' 	and 'push back on them' crossed 	the line.
@Ocasio2018 It's not the zip code. 	It's the intelligence and hard work.
@newsbusters Yeah, I think Ms. Jordan should skip a paycheck or two for adding to FAKE NEWS.M
@JudicialWatch Hey JW and @TomFitton , keep up the fight.	BUILD THE WALL and LOCK HER UP.
@CNN Good reporting @CNN, no FAKE NEWS this time.	'BUILD THE WALL'. Keep animals like this guy OUT.
@CNNSitRoom @CNN @maziehirono @Acosta Of course not @maziehirono , because you are 	all obstructionists and 'no border security morons'
@charliekirk11 Not to mention a bunch of votes for the Dems
@GOPLeader Oh no, @GOPLeader McCarthy referred to that poor man as a MONSTER. I'm sure that will cause some snowflakes to have their hair standing on end. Let's call him an animal instead.
@CNN Oh really? Please, say it ain't so.
@CNN @CNNOpinion This leaves me wondering if this group of CNN contributors is any more successful in their prognostications than CNN reporters are in their reporting.
@TheLeadCNN @CNN @SenDonnelly We'll see about that @SenDonnelly
@r0sey29 @_stryker1 @realDonaldTrump I’m not sure who you were talking to.	I don’t think you are a bot.
@NancyKauf @realDonaldTrump That is Ercactly what happens. Also their families send things like that from the US.
@r0sey29 @realDonaldTrump No. They either brought them from the US or their family sent them from the US.
@DonaldJTrumpJr @realDonaldTrump Yeah, what a joke. I guess CNN did not any fact-checking before giving that award. Further evidence that CNN is FAKE NEWS!
@SenSchumer I’m confused @cryingchuck, what part of “I won’t sign it if it does not include wall funding” don’t you understand?
@SenSchumer @realDonaldTrump Mexico is paying for the wall with the USMCA.
@Acosta You are the ADVERSARY of the people as long as you peddle FAKE NEWS.
@Acosta President Ttump told us that many times. Is there a good reason you and others don’t listen to him?
@Acosta Who cares?
@GovMikeHuckabee @realDonaldTrump Thanks for the info Governor, but how do we get such info into the mainstream media
@realDonaldTrump Ok, I’ll buy that. But please ...	BUILD THE DAMN WALL!!
@ivyfrancis81 @Kokomothegreat @realDonaldTrump Kathie is an idiot..Kathie is an idiot..Kathie is an idiot..Kathie is an ifiot
@jarringcreation @realDonaldTrump It’s a woman, idiot.
@realDonaldTrump Christopher Zillow is wrong.	Stefanowski is what CT needs.
