Did @MarkMeadows just attempt to repudiate the notion that Donald Trump is a racist by identifying a lone African-American who doesn't think it's true?
It's early going but at least one thing is clear at this point: Michael Cohen came to play.
Or, to rephrase: Democrats have invited someone to testify to Congress who WORKED FOR TRUMP FOR A DECADE AND is literally going to jail, in part, for lying to Congress under oath ON TRUMP'S BEHALF. https://t.co/LMFMeMgbyx
@MichaelCohen212 came to play.
Yeah it's the media giving Cohen credibility -- and not @realDonaldTrump who employed him as his main fixer for a decade. https://t.co/DCSh3UOIgV

On tonight's @SHO_TheCircus, "Senatorial Combat," we dive deep into three key races: @SenDeanHeller v @RepJackyRosen in NV, @kyrstensinema v @RepMcSally in AZ, and @SenatorHeitkamp v @kevincramer in ND -- where I also took a trip to @StandingRockST to explore the voter ID story. https://t.co/6YiefxBFzX

Grotesque. Disgusting. Shameful. https://t.co/rS3Z7GSTos
Bottom line: @SenatorHeitkamp argues @kevincramer will be a rubber stamp for @realDonaldTrump and @senatemajldr. Cramer basically says: yup, and that's better for ND.
The extent to which the Kavanaugh confirmation battle altered the midterm political terrain is vividly on display in #NDSenDebate. Multiple Qs, and on each one, @kevincramer clearly believes he is playing the winning hand.
Not clear from this exchange that Cramer knows the difference between those two words. https://t.co/zov4fwihy3
@kevincramer says the Kavanaugh hearings showed the world what "mob rule" looked like. Hard to figure, tho, how the "mob" "ruled" when Kavanaugh got confirmed. ü§î #NDSenDebate

A question that's been nagging at me for the past 3 weeks, and seems even more intriguing now: What has John Roberts been thinking -- and maybe doing, behind the scenes -- about the Kavanaugh spectacle?
@SanjuktaMPaul @SenatorCollins @senatemajldr @Sen_JoeManchin You're not bothering me at all -- and I was just genuinely asking what in my tweet led you to think I was jumping to a conclusion about how Collins would vote. (I've been saying for the past two weeks I thought she was likely a Yes.)

A truly remarkable development that will likely have zero impact on what is about to unfold. https://t.co/vmRq13uBuq
The contrast between Fox News interview Kavanaugh and Ford hearing Kavanaugh is quite jarring.
@SenatorDurbin was very strong on the question of an FBI investigation. Kavanaugh's replies were, well, not.
I'll ask again: Why would a man this indignant, emotional, and certain of his innocence not be demanding an FBI investigation of the accusations against him? Why is he not insisting that his friend Mark Judge testify on his behalf?

My God what a flailing gibberish-spouting mess @LindseyGrahamSC has become.
Not a single GOP Senator who wasn't already a hard Yes is a single millimeter closer to being one now -- and it's difficult to imagine what Kavanaugh could possibly say to move the needle for them at this point.
@franklinleonard Omg so interested -- and so looking forward to the long-form profile in which she eventually, inevitably cooperates.
I believe she just openly eviscerated the structure of the hearing devised by the men who hired her -- or did I mishear her??? https://t.co/KyXSE449HL

Short spring run, longer fall run -- that was the plan all along. See ya after Labor Day!!! https://t.co/XwOBGMvtQ4
@farawayliz You must have me confused with someone else.
I defer to your vastly greater knowledge on topics like these. But you do know who's runnung federal law enforcement, right? Don't see a lot of enthusiasm there (ie, I see zero) for (a) bringing civil rights cases, (b) on behalf of ordinary black men, against cops. https://t.co/nWN7cFRyfb

@hookembuzz @mindy965 My reply was to Mindy. You might wanna learn how to use Twitter. And you lived it how? Did you know Kennedy or Bork? And the way you toss around "murderer" suggests you also might wanna consult a dictionary -- though that won't cure wing-nuttery, which seems to be your malady.
And no one knows that better than @theblatt. https://t.co/8fNjHQz5oN
It's Bork and yes he did -- he was Solicitor General and capitulated to RMN's demand to fire special counsel Archibald Cox after AG Elliot Richardson and Dep AG William Ruckelshaus refused and resigned in protest. https://t.co/Orq1UYDE7d
@mindy965 @hookembuzz You might consider Googling.
Accurate. https://t.co/YWKUvO0e1C
@NonDemNonRepub @marieproia It makes perfect sense if you know how to use Twitter -- which is the platform you're using.
What McConnell did to Garland was shameful, appalling, profoundly cynical, and utterly free of principle. But Dems can't stop Trump's pick with a process argument. Has to be about bigger things, and abortion and health care are a good place to start (but not end). https://t.co/APfjbo8yNj
To be even clearer: no sane person considers this anything but utterly baseless, fantastical bullshit. https://t.co/ZIms21rq09

No -- I asked about three accounts, one by POTUS/allies, one by NYT, and one by Guardian. The last two are the relevant pair, but it's insane to pretend like POTUS and his allies aren't also telling a story, even if it is false. https://t.co/R96trM3tLJ

Hey @JWGOP I take your point -- to a point. Putting aside the lies of POTUS, there are credible journos from credible instits offering differing accounts of how the Trump-Russia counter-intel investigation got started.

@BonBodeBar @sarocthemc True.
@Gunntwitt @LaVeiledFemme Correct.
@LaVeiledFemme @Gunntwitt "I'm on a Republican" = "I'm not a Republican" with a typo. As is obvious by the construction of the sentence.
"Putin Will Teach You To Love The Motherland" by @pussyrrriot https://t.co/4LiHhyGOjm
@LaVeiledFemme @Gunntwitt Don't know about "everyone" and I'm not tripping, just trying to help you out with some facts. Impossible I ever told you I'm a Republican -- or a Democrat -- since I've never been either.

@tomselliott Not saying it's sinister at all. Saying one of his main roles in the party now is catering to its donor class, which doesn't care abt the size of government as long as corp taxes are low and corp profits high -- and desperately fears a trade war and its consquences in the market.
#onit https://t.co/umyWBU1tTU
@tomselliott The Paul Ryan of Empower America days wasn't Speaker of the House or the biggest fundraising draw in the Republican Party. The idea that donor maintenance and "pragmatism" are unrelated is a little naive. (Also, curious, have you ever actually spoken to Paul Ryan?)

@eledoux @united Righteous.
@united It's an R-rated movie, clearly labeled as such. Adults with kids can decide for themselves whether to let their children watch. Odd that your competitors grasp this idea and you have trouble with it. Another reason they're outperforming you.
It's a tremendous film. Not as great as @GetOutMovie -- the best pic of 2017 -- but still exceptional (when the profanity isn't dubbed out, that is). Cc @JordanPeele https://t.co/Z55IxaRWZM

Watching R3 now @briankoppelman and that key beach scene with @TheSlyStallone and Talia is a really nice piece of genre writing!
@GregHale1 Reasonable. I have a deep personal attachment to Rocky 3 that kind of clouds my judgment. But Creed is a brill reboot, all props Ryan Coogler and @michaelb4jordan.
@briankoppelman @RoryOMalley He's the best.
And agree with Creed in 3 spot on ranking 1-5.
Totally agree (and relieved/psyched we are on the same page on this, as I think it is a key life/art question). And we even have the same order rank on 1-4!!! I've not seen R5 or RB. https://t.co/UEliHUD55J
