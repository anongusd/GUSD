COHEN: I am sorry for my lies and for lying to Congress. To our nation, I am sorry for actively working to hide from you the truth about Mr. Trump when you needed it most.
Alright folks 2 pages to go in this opening statement.
I never thought I cared about a president's SAT scores, but  now that you mention it...
Cohen: He finished the conversation with the following comment. “You think I’m 	stupid, I wasn’t going to Vietnam.” I find it ironic, President Trump, that you are in Vietnam right now.
Cohen is giving the committee letters he sent to those entities threating civil and criminal actions if they did not comply.
Cohen: When I say conman, I’m talking about a man who declares himself brilliant but directed me to threaten his high school, his colleges, and the College Board to never release his grades or SAT scores.
Cohen: I am going to jail in part because of my decision to help Mr. Trump hide that payment from the American people before they voted a few days later.

@MAlexanderB1 Dug into this-- she could pay herself a salary using leftover campaign funds. She could also take out a short term loan just like anybody else. And she can also use campaign funds for campagin/political related travel i.e. if she has to come to DC for a week during transition
Ok this was kind of stunning to me. She has options though. According to FEC data, Ocasio-Cortez finished the campaign with over $500,000 COH. She could under FEC rules pay herself a salary with that campaign cash. https://t.co/U3oIVbT8hf

@jamiedupree that is a crazy addition to this thread, thank you for aging yourself while adding insights
Before Karen Handel won the special election-- GA-6 was held by Newt Gingrich for 20 years, followed by now-Senator Johnny Isakson, and then Tom Price. 	Now, not only does a Dem win the seat for the first time since 1979, but it's the first time its held by an African American

@ChrisPaulRoney I sort of agree but to a less extent. It makes more sense for the most qualified judges in the judicial system to come from the best law schools. More crazy when you talk about high schools, which are not merit based.
This is so funny. https://t.co/EAvyD6ihc3

Collins: "The #MeToo is real and it matters"
Collins on Blasey-Ford's testimony-- she says it was "sincere painful and compelling" but none of the witnesses Ford suggested remember being at the party she describes. Says Mark Judge and PJ said they weren't there under penalty of felony.

Anyway. Just a reminder voters rarely fit into the neat boxes that make them predictable. And he never brought up Kavanaugh.
But he was mostly worried about paying for his dads funeral. He died in January. He served in the navy for 30 years. And my driver had to bury him in a military cemetery rather than the plot next to his mom because of finances. That was a really heartbreaking decision for him.
his advice to the president, who he says has done some good things so far: “Dude just stay off Twitter. Stop worrying about the NFL you’ve got a country to run” oh and he hates urban Meyer.
Thinks republicans can be “too old fashioned” but Democrats want people to “rely on the government too much”, thinks Hillary is a “crook” and Bill is “creepy”, doesn’t feel like either party really serves him but wants to find someone he could vote for again

@MDStrawPSU ha my first day full time in news was at the local station on the first day of the trial.. facts can be fuzzy but i was following quite closely.
@MDStrawPSU Mcqueery reported the incident to police &amp; told Paterno about it acc'g to docs. Paterno did deny knowledge of abuse. My goal was not to re-litigate Sandusky scandal, but draw a parallel.  Public opinion did have consequences outside of court rulings https://t.co/45nHXobM79
@gypsyluc @mikiebarb of course not. But public opinion isn't without consequences, right or wrong as that may be. It didnt take a court ruling for things to play out for Paterno the way they did.
@gypsyluc @mikiebarb Paterno also completely denied wrongdoing. I’m not accusing anyone of anything but despite paternos denial- public opinion is that he was involved in wrong doing and did know about abuse.
@_MckinleyEdward thats ok! always happy to engage.

this means more than a hundred Republicans voted against the bill that was dubbed a compromise for the caucus
Yikes this House bill is going down in dramatic fashion. 301 nays, 121 yays
The similarities put simply: male 10-term incumbent faces woman of color. The differences: 43-year-old Ayanna Presley has experience/name recognition (first black woman elected to Boston city council) that Alexandria Ocasio Cortez did not.

First results coming in for #PA18 https://t.co/WQBtctOpeE
@nedf642 I think Lamb has a good chance, but the dynamic of the race will be different if its two incumbents running against each other versus lamb running against an incumbent
@TeaneckMtneers this is someone who understands me.
@PatrickHussion The AP reporting says 20-30% across the district. I don't know specifically by county. Anecdotally, I've heard lines in some places and definitely the talk of the town.
@NoRoJo44 I don't know that he'll get the backing of the NRCC or CLF, but I also haven't heard the name of another Republican planning to run in that district
Regardless of the outcome tonight though, a reminder that both of these candidates will be running again in different districts in a matter of weeks. Saccone will likely be a member of Congress come November no matter what happens tonight. Lamb not so sure.
If Saccone loses tonight and the spin from Republicans is that they had a bad candidate, it will at least be consistent spin. But the fact remains they spent more than $10 million on the race, outspending Dems 5 to 1
National Republicans (and some involved at the state level) have been complaining about Saccone since day 1. One operative said to me in December: "This is a race against an A and an F and our guy isn't the A"
Some thoughts: The day that Lamb became the Dem candidate I walked in to the bar in my parents' neighborhood to find the whole Lamb family celebrating. That's how our town is. Everyone somehow knows each other. Lamb may be new to the political scene but he's not an unknown name.

@jordanjfrasier haha my retired dad would love to give tours to "all your reporter friends in town"
@DaytonGem you are correct!
There's obviously a case for both candidates, but this race only determines who will serve until Nov. before Dems can even theoretically take the House soo the idea Lamb would be part of the Democratic wave whose sole focus is impeachment is not right.
This endorsement makes a strange argument about impeachment proceedings if Lamb is elected "The Democrats in the House have only one agenda item at the moment...It is impeachment... one must ask what the consequence for the country will be if we dive into so great a distraction." https://t.co/s9RbeLnUTJ
@databyler good stuff! A lot of coverage misses this context around my hometown :)
This is a good thread. I endorse. https://t.co/Y6OjlbhF6K
also remember- Lamb and Saccone will turn around and compete in primaries six weeks after this race is over IN DIFFERENT DISTRICTS. This race matters much more to the national parties than it does to the future of these particular candidates
@JeremyR1992 ohh so yummy! Luckily my nieces have Sarris fundraisers at school so I stock up at Christmas on all sorts of goodies
Here's the frustrating thing about coverage of #PA18 -- the real "forgotten" voters there are the Democrats in Allegheny Co. part of the district who havent had a viable candidate for this seat in a decade. Probably won't find that person at a diner in Canonsburg/Moon Twp.
This line from Saturday is still cracking me up. "I hear he's better looking. I think I'm better looking than him. I do. I do."
Rick Saccone is campaigning with Donald Trump Jr. today at Sarris Candies a day before the special election in #PA18 (the home of the best ice cream sundae, where I went if I got all A's on my report card)

So my point is while the amount Republicans are spending is jarring--it says more about Lamb as a candidate than it does about the district rejecting Trump.
Democrats haven't had a candidate in this district in 2 cycles but really far longer. Since 2002, only one Democratic candidate broke 40% of the vote against Murphy. Dems have struggled to recruit there for more than a decade
Democrats have the enthusiasm advantage: Well before Murphy resigned, grass roots dem groups protested outside of his office every week. They've been outside Toomey's office every week. There were energized Democrats in this red district for a year before there was a race

RT @nickconfessore: That WaPo story is as carefully bulletproofed as any I’ve seen. There is no credible reason to doubt it.
What does that mean? Well if Moore drops out, there would be a three way race that would likely mean Strange keeps the job for a bit longer.
In that scenario, Strange would still serve until they have another election and fill the seat
Past the point of no return: even if Moore drops out, his name will be on the ballot. Votes for him DO count--if votes for Moore keep Jones from getting 50+1, election in null and void and we start from square one
Luther Strange CAN run a write-in campaign. The "sore loser law" only applies to names printed on the ballot.
I just got off the phone with the Alabama secretary of state's office so here's a couple things... /1

This reminds me of reaction to another Washington Post story just over a year ago.. https://t.co/EHCOqnf0Xf
Who is going to determine if the allegations are true? Post has half a dozen people on the record corroborating story. Moore says its fake news. Republicans now have to say if they believe it or not? https://t.co/xSQoZFTwGQ
