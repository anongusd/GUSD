With only around 3,900 left in the wild, every tiger counts. But China’s latest move to lift the ban on tiger bone trade threatens to put a dark cloud over the world’s wild 🐯
China has shown leadership to #endwildlifecrime by banning ivory trade, but this move allowing limited use and trade in rhino horn &amp; tiger bone is a huge setback to efforts to protect tigers &amp; rhinos in the wild.
WWF urgently calls on China to maintain the ban on tiger bone and rhino horn trade, and close captive facilities where tigers are bred for commercial purposes.		Please RT and support our call for change! 🙏🏻
