@tonyschwartz For me it is Donnie Jr.  He's an arrogant snotty nosed spoiled priveledged smart mouthed little shit. I'd love to see them put his ass in prison. He needs that kind of reality check.
@GOP @IvankaTrump Yeah, sure. We get it. Ivanka is all about working families.  Her strong work ethics are reflected in her own family. She follows the example she grew up with. Honesty, integrity, hard work.  It's all there for the world to see.	Bless her little heart !
@DonaldJTrumpJr Are you reading all the love and support you're getting here, Donnie. Maybe you should look to fleeing for Mexico or some country that wouldn't extradite you.  You are in big trouble, Donnie. Very Big Trouble.
@SenatorFischer @realDonaldTrump It was a waste of taxpayer money. A political stunt. In the end it was worthless and meaningless. He accomplished nothing. Wait and see. It may have actually been damaging in the long run.  This was not a diplomatic process. It was Donald being "Great Again"  Major Fail !
@LindseyGrahamSC @realDonaldTrump You are certainly consistent Lindsey. Disappointingly so.
