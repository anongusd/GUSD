@CapehartJ It was inconceivable until we learned that Russians hacked and weaponized the Democrat's solely to elect Trump, all the while he was negotiating with them to build a tower in Moscow. He's been trying to lower sanctions. His whole team lied about contacts with Russia, etc.
I will continue to share this Tweet until we learn its true import. Manafort was gone from the campaign at this point. How much was he engineering from behind the scenes? Are we supposed to believe that Trump didn’t know? #TrumpKnew #Manafort https://t.co/1cyezycHsv
@ZoeTillman I have very little sympathy for Manafort's failing health, if he's claiming it's because of these proceedings or his jail time. He is in part responsible for our national nightmare; all because of his and Trump's greed.

@ancientknots @Heart__Is__Home @CNN Addiction is a disease. But also refraining from ingesting addictive substances requires willpower, no? Id be interested to hear from someone who has recovered from addiction to alcohol, opioids, etc whether they feel sugar is on par.
@Heart__Is__Home @CNN There is that cost, no denying that. But that isn’t solely sugar. It’s also carbs, fat and lack of exercise. Now imagine heroin, cocaine, etc were as readily available as sugar.
@CNN The “what about sugar??” people need to stop. Sugar withdrawal is feeling bummed &amp; sluggish; that’s hardly comparable to physical withdrawal from heroin, alcohol. No 12-step meetings for sugar. No DUIs, no broken homes. It’s an addiction but it only requires willpower, not rehab.

@TeflonDom1975 @Brainmage But that’s just it; *I* find it gross. I’m not buying his albums anymore or paying to see him. No one is dictating to *you* whether or not you should like him. He crossed a line as far as I’m concerned. And I like blue comics! 2/
@TeflonDom1975 @Brainmage Literally no one said, “You shouldn’t laugh at that.” I was a big fan of his until I learned he was masturbating in front of female comedians and killing their careers if they threatened to report him.

@tdoug1970 @organic_twinkie @PollySigh1 @JulieLVNV @NickMiroff @BobMooreNews Crossing the border illegally is a misdemeanor. I don’t know where you live Doug, but I live among immigrants and every single I know works their tail off and stays out of trouble.

@tdoug1970 @organic_twinkie @PollySigh1 @JulieLVNV @NickMiroff @BobMooreNews The lack of a wall has never meant open borders. It’s just a line that conservatives used to troll liberals; that’s all that is. It doesn’t appear you’re interested in meaningful debate, just sealioning.

@Dollarlogic At the end of the day, this will be the least of Trump’s worries. He’s likely on the hook for far worse crimes. The only hope is that he’ll resign as part of a deal.
@Dollarlogic @NRO @DavidAFrench He lied about it over and over again. Paid attorneys to go on tv and lie about it. That suggests consciousness of guilt and is used to determine whether the person knew a crime was being committed. I believe the article addresses that point.
@BlakberrySmoke @MissNyetTrump @docrocktex26 In the meantime it’s against the law to be an uninsured motorist. 🤷🏻‍♀️
@BlakberrySmoke @MissNyetTrump @docrocktex26 In the meantime, people will die because Republicans have no solutions for the healthcare problem. Being denied insurance because you have a pre-existing condition is deadly. And it seems Republicans are looking for a political win, versus something that will help people.
@Dollarlogic @NRO @DavidAFrench I don’t think the court finds it muddy 🤷🏻‍♀️
@Dollarlogic @NRO @DavidAFrench Here’s a thread about direct v. circumstantial evidence: https://t.co/kt6Meiv8ct
@Dollarlogic @NRO @DavidAFrench You can spend your whole career as an attorney offering hush money to allllll the women with whom your client has affairs. When it’s six weeks before the election, that’s considered a campaign contribution.
@Dollarlogic @NRO @DavidAFrench I had heard the “woman problem” bit on Morning Joe but can’t find a link. 		It’s not a “narrative.” The SDNY referred to Trump as an unnamed co-conspirator. The legal issues he is facing aren’t a product of political punditry; it seems he broke the law. https://t.co/kg55h7vtWl
@Dollarlogic @NRO @DavidAFrench The payments were made years after the indiscretion. Trump said to AMI &amp; Cohen in summer of 2015 “I may have a woman problem. How can you help me with my campaign?” Then the stories were killed weeks before the election. Those = facts. That’s an illegal campaign contribution.

@AMFtwitt @JochenML @maralagoing @semperdiced @ProudResister @InSpiteOfTrump @ManInTheHoody Just because two sides declare they’re the good guys doesn’t mean they’re both right. If one side comes at the problem with an inherent prejudice and distain for people of color, that side does not get to then claim moral superiority.
@jeanna_bluedot @JochenML @maralagoing @semperdiced @ProudResister @InSpiteOfTrump @AMFtwitt @ManInTheHoody Yes exactly. It’s not just the tear-gassing of toddlers. This is a result of this administration ginning up fear and responding to a made-up crisis by shutting down the border. These people are desperate and ideally want legal entry. It’s not against the law to seek asylum.
@DEETERVONCVNTH The mothers of toddlers were doing that? Amazing.
@terrimore1 What would you do? Everyone is a big expert on what they’d do if faced with violence, persecution, and extreme poverty in their home country.
@harrytuttlehvac @bobbakek It’s perfectly legal to seek asylum at a point of entry. I haven’t seen reporting that the mothers of toddlers were throwing rocks, but I’m sure your position is they have no right to enter the country, but that’s not what the law states.
@harrytuttlehvac This argument is nonsense and only demonstrates that you don’t know the difference between women who choose to be pregnant and women who choose not to be. And I support them both as do all women who support women’s autonomy.
@harrytuttlehvac Tear gas can cause spontaneous abortion. 🤷🏻‍♀️
@checkingjournos Ah yes the old “But Obama!” dodge. When you can’t defend what this administration is doing, refer to Obama. We heard it when children were being caged too.
@maralagoing @semperdiced @ProudResister @JochenML @InSpiteOfTrump @AMFtwitt @ManInTheHoody Not even fetal life, apparently, because tear gas has been known to cause spontaneous abortion. But they just blame the mother.
@LaDolphina It’s f***ing ridiculous.
@bobbakek Tear gas can cause spontaneous abortion. But keep defending atrocities for political purposes. Democrats aren’t baby killers; they simply defend women’s bodily autonomy. Pregnant women escaping violence deserve protection. https://t.co/xHrZSCEaMO
The tear-gassing of toddlers brings out the delightful intersection of far-right, anti-immigrant trolls + “pro-life” trolls.
@randasil @TheJuliaWeber @girlsreallyrule Planned parenthood also provides support for pregnant women. What Planned parenthood and I have in common is we support bodily autonomy for women. And you thought it was best to make a crude joke. Miss me with your false outrage.
@RaisaCramer @KaivanShroff The only way to reach people like that is to ask them to put themselves in someone else’s shoes. I have found that most people who think like that or either unwilling or unable to do that. 😞
@cameron_kasky @JustinGPNW My favorite are the ones blaming the mothers for having their children there, having no compassion for the pregnant women, while their entire timeline is about the sanctity of life. Apparently abortion is fine if your baby was spontaneously aborted because you were tear-gassed.
Big shout out to all the angry white women this morning experiencing cognitive dissonance over being proudly “Pro-Life” while also declaring that pregnant women seeking asylum deserve to be tear-gassed. #BorderShutdown #Tijuana #TearGas https://t.co/OT7e63em1W
@TheJuliaWeber @girlsreallyrule The only way to seek asylum legally is at the port of entry. Also, coming into this country illegally is a misdemeanor. The penalty for committing a misdemeanor in this country is not to be doused with tear gas, which can cause an unborn fetus to die.

And incidentally because the two experiences I’ve had with the two male doctors, I now only exclusively see women. #SorryNotSorry #YoureFired
In 2016 my therapist asked what my biggest stressor was and I said “Donald Trump.” I told her that white women voted him into office because they felt he’d save them from ISIS. She told me Clinton was “arrogant toward the military.” I never saw her again. #YoureFired
I mean, I feel lousy and I take my temperature. No one’s resting normal temperature is 100. Come on. 😡 #YoureFired
I’ve been having unexplained low grade fevers for years, literally. My doctor suggested I was “pushing the thermometer in too far.” Or “maybe your resting temperature is higher than normal.” No and no. #YoureFired
The first physician I saw in my adulthood gave a me a very quick and tidy breast exam. He cupped and pushed up on my both breasts, that’s it. Worthless exam. Felt more like an unwanted touch than an exam. #MeToo #YoureFired
My first gynecologist hesitated to prescribe me birth control when I was a teenager. He was disgusted with me. But I actually fired him when he told me “lose TWO POUNDS.” I was 17. #YoureFired 2/

@sydthepiper @nytimes If a person is only allowed to vote once, what’s the difference? If someone has a stroke and can only sign with an “X” they should still be able to vote. Are they worried that dead people are voting?  How would a dead person get an absentee ballot? The whole thing is silly.

@ChuckGrassley Senator, if it’s the same thing then why didn’t you allow Ford to bring witnesses to testify before the committee? Why didn’t Republicans interview Kavanaugh instead of shouting about what a travesty it was? You never took it seriously. You just want your judge appointed.
@Boomingbox @desiderioDC @SenSasse She’s not a mascot. And there are many women who have been abused or attacked who would have done the same in her stead. She didn’t “attack” Kavanaugh. She sat in front of a microphone and said he tried to rape her.

@P51SN95 @SofiaMJ2 @charlescwcooke He must pull all of his facts about politics and the world around him from the ether then. It’s a ridiculous position to take and is also the talking point of an authoritarian POTUS. No thanks.

@avidgamefan @PDXJulia @NateSilver538 @ElieNYC Everyone else is assuming the Democrats have acted in bad faith by adhering to Dr. Ford's wishes in keeping her report anonymous.
@joshtpm @TPM Everything makes me want to scream.
@NatasjaYonce @EWErickson That's a very cynical take that makes assumes a lot. Did she set up the gofundme pages herself? Is there evidence of a book deal? Have you seen any tv interviews? Why would you assume she wants fame? She's lauded for coming forward as a survivor. You have it all wrong.
@Dorijac @ChrisMurphyCT @SenBlumenthal His record on Veterans' issues is far more important than a lie he told for which he's since apologized. Feel free to Google it for yourself but as a CT resident I'm well aware of the good he has done which is why I always defend him.
@EWErickson No woman comes forward, at great risk to her life and career, endures death threats, boards a plane and travels 3,000 miles to speak under oath before the Senate, and demands an FBI investigation to support a false claim. 		Your tribalism is showing.
@avidgamefan @PDXJulia @NateSilver538 @ElieNYC Are we assuming now that Republicans would have acted in good faith?

@ChrisMurphyCT @SenBlumenthal It appears that Blumenthal apologized for misleading statements about his service 8 years ago. https://t.co/8p9fbxbgze		However, from what I’ve seen online, it seems there is a coordinated effort on the right to attack Sen. Blumenthal. Of course POTUS is leading the charge.
@shannonrwatts They have no idea how f*^^ing angry we are. 🤬
@BSamCook @bessbell He wrote “Devil’s Triangle” in his yearbook and told the Senate Judiciary Committee it’s a drinking game. It’s not; it’s a sex position with two men and a woman. This post isn’t hateful. It’s illustrating that Kavanaugh perjured himself.
@TheBreadManRC @SC_Michelle @davidfrum A family member inappropriately kissed and fondled me when I was 9. Everything is foggy except the feeling and his face. 		You diminish others’ pain because they don’t remember as much as you did. It isn’t logical or fair to project that on others.

@BioticHamster No; I was just being formal. 😉
I’m not condoning what he did, but the man apologized 8 years ago. The attacks on Sen. Blumenthal on Twitter seem to be a coordinated effort since he’s involved in the Kavanaugh hearings &amp; is suing Trump regarding  receiving foreign money. https://t.co/aD5S9vMiR5

In which Brett Kavanaugh perjures himself - AGAIN - by telling Sen. Hatch that the first time he heard about Ramirez' allegations was in New Yorker article dated 9/23. He was texting friends this summer to discredit her. #StopKavanaugh https://t.co/o4axthGHH5
NBC buried the lead. This suggests perjury. "Kavanaugh was asked by Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, when he first heard of Ramirez’s allegations. Kavanaugh answered: 'In the New Yorker story.'" Perjury. Disqualifying. Nothing more to see. @ChrisCoons @JeffFlake https://t.co/MIpAq9tXMi
"...[the] texts show [he] may need to be questioned about how far back he anticipated Ramirez would air allegations...Berchem says, in her memo, that Kavanaugh “&amp;/or” his friends “may have initiated an anticipatory narrative” as early as July to “conceal or discredit” Ramirez 5/
"In a series of texts prior to the...New Yorker story, Yarasavage wrote that she had been in contact with 'Brett's guy.'" "Yarasavage also told her friend that she turned over a copy of the wedding party photo to Kavanaugh, writing “I had to send it to Brett’s team too.” 4/

@stlgirlinlex @gh14hinojosa5 @jdickerson We are discussing possibility that Kavanaugh may have gotten blackout drunk during his high schools years and, in his mind, is telling the truth about not having assaulted Blasey-Ford because he truly can't remember. It has nothing to do with other men &amp; that's an odd inference.
@zonkeroo @jdickerson I don't know about you, Funky Grrl, but that hearing had echoes of the unsuccessful interventions I've had with an alcoholic family member: the defensiveness, the denials, the aggression.

@dragoaslise @johnacurtis1199 @CBSNews What does it matter whether anything new was learned? The question was when would Kavanaugh file a libel suit and I seriously doubt he ever will. If he dislikes the scrutiny he’s received this week wait until a court case drags on for a year.

@norlaskan @YegCanadian83 @AynRandPaulRyan @RealDesertRat @brithume This stood out to me:		Judge Kavanaugh: “[Polygraph tests] are not admissible in federal court because they’re not reliable, as you know.”		Reality:  As a judge on the D.C. Circuit, Kavanaugh has ruled otherwise — finding that polygraphs are in fact reliable.

@nilgirian @thinkprogress People who don’t drink to the point of passing out almost never black out. If drinking to excess weren’t problematic for him he wouldn’t have lied about it. We’re supposed to believe he vomited from eating spaghetti as well I suppose.
@nilgirian @thinkprogress “Fell asleep” is a euphemism for “passing out.” Kavanaugh can’t admit to passing out because it suggests he’s likely blacked out too, which would cast doubt on his ability to remember events properly.

A woman comes forward, out of a sense of civic duty, and speaks out about sexual assault. She’s doxxed. Death threats are made. Senators say she’s “mixed up.” The POTUS asks, “Why didn’t she come forward earlier?” What’s the first thing Kavanaugh did? He hired a woman. 1/

@chrislhayes That’s a exactly what I’ve been thinking.

@pigSkinman @MonaSigal @brooks_rosa It would be easier to believe he was telling the truth if he hadn’t already been accused of perjury during the confirmation hearings. Also his ruling in the Jane Doe case displayed hostility toward women.
The girls basketball team, the letter from 65 women already in the hopper...Republicans knew he was hostile to Roe v Wade and knew of the rape allegation. They wanted to ram him through anyway because this is all one big grotesque metaphor.
Republicans threatening Trump-style thug tactics, threatening to nominate someone “more conservative” if their pick is withdrawn. Perhaps they should nominate someone who isn’t hostile toward women. https://t.co/4rsrc3F3eW

@RadioFreeTom @LJBreedlove Women are screaming and no one is listening: when their abusers run for powerful government positions where they make decisions about women’s reproductive choices, sometimes women speak up AS A CIVIC DUTY &amp; face ruination.

@EWErickson Conservative men in their blind tribalism continue to insult abuse survivors. In this particular take, comparing rape to “stealing a person’s lunch money.” It’s ok sometimes to just let others talk.
@GregMitch Trump said Putin denied that he interfered in our elections. Emphatically. More than once. But he’s a f***ing liar, so.
I’ve never sexually assaulted anyone or attempted to sexually assault someone. Ever.		See how easy that is?
@RadioFreeTom @bttr_as1 Things have changed. Public opinion on marijuana’s changed. Public opinion on rape &amp; sexual assault has changed as well: public agrees it’s not ok to rape &amp; assault women &amp; still ascend to SCOTUS, which affects ALL. 	17-year old Kavanaugh knew it was wrong; he covered her mouth.

@2017_itstime @GOP Exactly! This guy has abysmal approval ratings. The fact that they’re jamming him through despite that is a horrifying metaphor for the sexual assault allegations.
@JamilSmith Exactly. I hear: “Women, some of us are going to rape you; it happens. It doesn’t mean we should be removed from positions of power. You can vote but you’re still second class citizens.”
@TheMosasaurus @RadioFreeTom Kavanaugh appears to have perjured himself during the hearings. If he lied about this as well it speaks to his lack of integrity. Then as a judge he tries to make a young woman wait until it's too late to get an abortion? A pattern of hostility toward women.
Part of what the #MeToo movement has given us is the confidence to say, “If you have harmed women, you do not deserve the privilege to lead us nor do you receive the ability to legislate our bodies.“ #StopKavanagh
@EWErickson This is so disgusting. I pray you never find yourself in a position where you've been sexually assaulted by a person who is about to receive the keys to the kingdom to overturn legislation involving your reproductive rights. Take several seats. Shame!
This is why women are running for office. We are so fed up. Every time a woman comes forward with an assault allegation we hear how unfortunate the timing is, how it ruins HIS life. Her pain is used as a weapon. Then men continue to legislate our bodies. ENOUGH! #Basta #Kavanaugh

The fact that someone blocked me when confronted with the truth is sad. You can be angry that Morning Joe didn’t do enough in 2016 but they’re doing a lot now. It’s important we be critical thinkers and not led around by the nose by people who say what we want to hear. 7/7
I’m fine with people harboring anger toward Scarborough and Brzezinski. They’re entitled. But it is inaccurate to state that they never were/are critical of Trump. It’s not ok for Trump &amp; co to lie and spread rumors and it’s not ok when we do it either. 6/
As of today, the show and it’s calcacade of experts daily swipes at Trump, saying he’s “Mueller may think he’s too stupid to testify” etc to bait him. The entire premise of the show is bashing him, rightly so. They hammer the GOP on healthcare, etc. 5/
I deleted Morning Joe from my podcast app after the Comey letter because Brzezinski couldn’t contain her disdain for Clinton and her “misdeeds.” After the election I started watching the show again. 4/
At some point during that summer, convinced he didn’t want to win or wouldn’t win, Morning Joe stopped being as critical of Trump and began reporting on WikiLeaks &amp; Clinton like literally everyone else. 3/
I listened to Morning Joe almost daily in the months leading up the election. They were very critical of his Muslim ban, of his want for use of our nuclear weapons. Scarborough repeatedly told him to step down over the mistreatment of the Kahn family. 2/
This morning someone blocked me over assertions that Morning Joe is never critical of Trump and never was. I didn’t particularly want to defend Morning Joe, but I don’t condone lying when either side does it. 1/

@FOTCangela @imwithher61 That’s delightful that you all “are with her” like she’s running for office but she doesn’t watch the show, otherwise she’d realize they attack Trump constantly. We’re all on the same team but I don’t appreciate people telling untruths.

@imwithher61 I listened every day in 2016. Scarborough told Trump to step down after the Kahn/gold star family debacle. At some point though they started going easier on him/hitting her harder so I deleted the show off my podcast app. It’s just incorrect to say they were never hard on him.
@imwithher61 Honest question: did you listen every day in 2016?
@imwithher61 Not entirely accurate. They interviewed him &amp; he said “Why can’t we use our nukes?” &amp; they continually brought up how bad that was. They hammered Clinton too obviously but Trump didn’t get a pass. At several points, Joe begged him to resign. They, like everyone, thought she’d win

Trump put Bannon on the *National Security Council,” which again was fine with Republicans who were working on their agenda of destroying healthcare, giving tax hikes to millionaires &amp; allowing Trump to put children in cages. 3/
It is not the responsibility of liberals to save the Republican Party from its worst instincts, which is to court the xenophobia, racism &amp; misogyny for more votes. 2/

@kevindavis338 @jaketapper Someone needs to write a political cartoon about how completely useless and irrelevant that statement you just wrote is. You haven’t addressed one single point constructively. If I never read that tired old line again I’ll die happy. 😐

@notcapnamerica @Geniusbastard I said to my husband last night, “I pray you never know this feeling: how dehumanizing &amp; disheartening it is to have men make decisions on what you can and can’t do with your body.” Who would feel they had the right to do that but men who felt women were inhuman vessels?

@MedianPolitics @gallarway @GoHokies2 @AdamWeinstein If he didn’t err on the side of caution and refrain from discussing the Russia investigation with trumps lawyers firm, then he has created a huge conflict of interest. And if he lied, it’s perjury.
@MedianPolitics @gallarway @GoHokies2 @AdamWeinstein That’s not what I meant. For Kavanaugh, discussing sports would be fine but discussing the Mueller investigation with attorneys who work at Donald Trump’s lawyers law firm would not be fine. And if he doesn’t know the difference, he doesn’t deserve the position.

@MedianPolitics @gallarway @GoHokies2 @AdamWeinstein It is for me! But I’m not jockeying for a vaunted lifetime spot on the SCOTUS.
@ParkerMolloy He’s arguing that in 1776 (when we didn’t even have antibiotics), the founding fathers, who didn’t even consider women to be full citizens, should have put language in the Constitution about abortion or rights of zygotes because now SCOTUS can pervert the meaning of liberty...?🤔
@MSNBC NO 😡 Graham was about to ask Kavanaugh about his feelings on a Constitutional Amendment as it pertains to abortion and they cut to Trump whining about the OpEd. IT DOESN’T MATTER. #KavanaughConfirmation #SaveRoe
@LindseyGrahamSC what you are not taking into consideration is if a President has been found to have participated in an illegal scheme to corrupt our democratic elections calling into question his legitimacy, he does not deserve to finish his term. #KavanaghHearing 	🍎🍎🍎🍊🍊🍊
@MedianPolitics @gallarway @GoHokies2 @AdamWeinstein He was positioning himself for a role in the SCOTUS. This idea he’s willy-nilly blabbing about the Mueller investigation is absurd. It’s not like discussing sports.

@GoHokies2 @AdamWeinstein Also, had Kavanaugh spoken with Trump’s lawyer’s firm &amp; Deripaska’s lawyer’s firm that would mean he’d need to recuse in all matters relating to the Mueller investigation. He knows this, which means he’d be careful to know to which lawyers he’s discussing Mueller investigation.
