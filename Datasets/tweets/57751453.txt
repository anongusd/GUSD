Obama also slams those in power for not "making sure 3,000 Americans don't die in a hurricane and its aftermath" -- a reference to the handling of Hurricane Maria and the damage done to #PuertoRico
More applause when President Obama says it shouldn't be partisan to be able to stand up unequivocally to Nazi sympathizers and then asks: How hard can that be? Saying Nazis are bad?
Obama says it shouldn't be partisan to say the attorney general should not be explicitly called to protect members of one party because an election is coming up; it shouldn't be Democratic or Republican to say we should not threaten the freedom of the press

Great write up of Obama's "united Europe" speech in Germany today, via my colleagues @Kevinliptakcnn &amp; @Nicole_CNN   https://t.co/g64OJ0Rozy
I lost count of how many times Obama hailed a "united Europe" in his big sweeping speech. It was a LOT. It's been a central msg on this trip
Obama quotes Pope Francis: Refugees are not numbers, they're people and need to be treated as such
Obama: Even as we work 2 end conflicts, Merkel &amp; others hv eloquently reminded us we can't turn our backs on human beings who need help now
Obama: The politics of immigration/refugees is hard in any country &amp; one nation shouldn't bear the burden, all share some responsibility
Obama: In unsettling times human nature is to w/draw to the perceived security of our own tribes/nationality etc but this is a false comfort
Obama: Fears about security or economic anxieties can't undermine our values
.....and all of our countries need to worry about inequality, Obama says in speech in Germany, aimed at all of Europe (and the US)
If neither the burdens nor the benefits of our global economy are being fairly distributed, its no wonder ppl rise up &amp; reject globalization
Obama: If we truly value our liberty we have to take the steps necy to share  info within Europe &amp; between US &amp; Europe to fight terrorism
Obama: We care about Europeans' &amp; Americans' privacy..Security &amp; privacy don‚Äôt have to be a contradiction. We can protect both &amp; we have to
Obama makes it official in Syria: I've approved deployment of up to 250 addl US special forces to keep up the momentum (aiding local forces)
Obama: I've come here today to the heart of Europe to say that the US &amp; the world needs a strong, prosperous, democratic and united Europe
Obama quotes Yeats on intolerance: It reminds me of the poem where the best lack all conviction &amp; the worst are full of passionate intensity
Obama says we're seeing increasing intolerance in our politics &amp; loud voices getting the most attention.   A pretty clear reference to Trump
Obama in Germany says conflicts in Syria, etc have sent people fleeing, putting strains on communities &amp; threatening to distort our politics
Obama: If u had to choose any time in human history to live w/o knowing what ur nationality/gender/economic status would be u'd choose now.
Obama opens remarks in Germany touching on the ACA &amp; progress on same-sex marriage &amp; climate change. Sounding like a legacy-defining speech
@JosephCRProgram Thanks! Or I guess I should say danka!

Germany's Merkel dodges Trump Q in presser saying only that she's focused on work to be done in 2016 &amp; is watching US elex w great interest
Fun good times https://t.co/Zy5ydS9qA3
The Bard is a nickname for William Shakespeare	 https://t.co/VBDekVCVIQ
Obama on his legacy-I've been true to myself during this process-Echoes Hamlet's Polonius to thine own self be true on anniv of Bards death
Obama: #Prince death a "remarkable loss." They played Purple Rain &amp; Delirious on a turntable at US amb's house this a.m. to "warm up" 4 2day
In UK presser, Obama says the cessation of hostilities in Syria has held longer than he expected and spoke of importance of maintaining it
PM Cameron dodges Trump Q, but says he's in "awe" of lengthy US election process &amp; jokes he's surprised anyone's left standing at the end
Obama to Brits in presser: US wants a strong UK within a strong Europe &amp; warns "Leave" camp there won't be quick separate US-UK trade deal

What the Ogletree character just said in @HBO 's #Confirmation is something a lot of black folks can relate to.

Obama on how every time a racial issue arises, people talk of need for a 'conversation about race' - "We don't need more talk." #Charleston
Obama covers lotsa ground n 'God's grace' eulogy: the subtle impulse 2 call Johnny back 4 an intervu but not Jamal, voting rts, gun violence
Obama: removing #Confederateflag = an acknowledgement that the cause the South fought for -slavery- was wrong &amp; an expression of God's grace
