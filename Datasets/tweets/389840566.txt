This past week, I voted to protect $97 million in funding for servicemembers at Nellis, Creech, &amp; the NLV National Guard Center.

Marched and voted in D.C. today on behalf of the 3,500 federal workers in Nevada missing paychecks because of the shutdown. I voted to #EndTheShutdown on the first day of the New Congress. And I’ll keep fighting to end the pain it's inflicting on Nevada families. https://t.co/bq5DO6VA99

Tule Springs and the Yerington Jobs Bill are headed to #POTUS. Thank you to all who worked so hard to pass these NV job-creating provisions.
There are provisions in the bill to fund the government that I do not agree with, but Washington must stop lurching from crisis to crisis.

W/sequester, law enforcement loses the equivalent of 1k federal agents, 1.3k prison officers, and more than 5k border patrol personnel #nv04
What does the sequester mean for education? 70,000 children would be kicked off Head Start and 10,000 teacher jobs put at risk. #nv04
Sequester is not a solution. The costs are simply too high: up to 373,000 mentally ill adults and children could go untreated. #nv04
Happy Lunar New Year! 2013 #YearoftheSnake is abt progress, focus, and discipline. I want the 113th Congress to follow those principles too.
