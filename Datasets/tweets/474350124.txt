Studies show that the US economy would stand to gain over $200 billion in annual economic activity and 1.3 million jobs over a 10-year period by meeting its water infrastructure needs. #SOTU #RuralMatters #RebuildRural
For every $1 million invested in water, 16 new jobs are created. #SOTU #RuralMatters
Most water infrastructure projects are funded by local ratepayer base, which makes investments in infrastructure projects challenging for systems that serve low-income populations. #SOTU #RuralMatters
There are an estimated 240,000 water main breaks per year in the US, wasting more than 2 trillion gallons of treated drinking water - water infrastructure matters. #RuralMatters #SOTU
