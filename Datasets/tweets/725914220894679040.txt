@teressaw2 @KamalaHarris Ukraine court already ruled Obama State dept and FBI ILLEGALLY meddled in election. So yes, our President at the time probably illegally meddled
@worldwidecouns1 @KamalaHarris @POTUS Lol
@monicamartyjr @KamalaHarris Yes it does#
@KamalaHarris It’s unacceptable to keep using OUR money to further harass the President. End this BS now! Ukraine court already ruled that Obama State dept/FBI (NABU), and DNC illegally changed election.

@willy1555 @AC360 @neal_katyal Almost Every indictment is just indictments AS A RESULT OF the investigation! Low IQ folks (despite ur hatred for the pres) can’t see that? Seriously.

@AC360 @neal_katyal So now CNN is setting up a situation where after two years no collusion was ever approved and we all know there was no evidence to even start the investigation, and these folks are telling us they’re going to keep using our money to look for something, anything? Fucking insane

@stahsha First of all you cannot create socialism while there is corruption in government. You cannot possibly Create socialism as most of our tax money is going to foreign nations. Think about it. Stahsha will not be getting more money in her pocket because a billionaire pays her
@stahsha LOL that’s not a response to my statement by any means.
@Vanniivy007 @mouseylibrarian @tannenbaumr Yeah, because the idiot promoting the idea of how corrupt millionaires and billionaires are followed by the idea of socialism – giving up 90% of one’s income for the very corrupt leaders to manage. OK low IQ folks🤪
@sneakerpants @teapot_backup @ckopa @TuckerCarlson Yep- Tucker was not able to finish a sentence because of the socialist promoting idiot, who, in one breath accuses elites of corruption, followed by the promotion of handing over 90% of one’s wealthy income to the very corrupt governments that those folks run.🤪

So when you laugh about Russian oligarchs that r close to Putin- you are helping the propaganda spread..
FOX news (Bongino) is literally lying to the President. It’s a fact that Ukraine ruled in their courts 12/2018 that Obama State Dep, FBI (NABU), and DNC illegally collided with Ukraine; Leschenko was who was communicating to Fusion.
If America knew the truth about Putin (who factually saved his nation FROM the oligarchs that were raping the people financially) the Russia narrative would be proven false.. the NATO warmongers will do anything to protect it- ergo why they hate trump..

@madisonpriceeee @steph93065 @KamalaHarris ... and babies feel pain. Makes no sense to make a law that allows torture.. that is what occurs if aborted in the womb. Why wouldn’t someone deliver and then administer hospice care?
@madisonpriceeee @steph93065 @KamalaHarris Then I became a Public Health Nurse for maternal child health and homeless..  the minimizing of child and women trafficking is horrendous. I can’t understand why folks that claim to b upset by separated families are ignoring this 🤷🏼‍♀️
@madisonpriceeee @steph93065 @KamalaHarris Not one medical reason- in fact, it would be higher risk for muom to abort than deliver and allow comfort measures and pain medicine.
@madisonpriceeee @steph93065 @KamalaHarris That is where many are duped. I’m not trying to b argumentative- but I am an RN; L&amp;D and NICU from 1995-2004. There is no condition that a baby must be terminated in the womb. None. Zilch.
@madisonpriceeee @steph93065 @KamalaHarris So you are OK with terminating in 3rd trimester? It’s a mother’s choice? Even if the baby can live outside the womb?
@madisonpriceeee @steph93065 @KamalaHarris Many agnostic democratus are vehemently opposed to this targeting of innocent black lives.
@madisonpriceeee @steph93065 @KamalaHarris So I’m sure you can understand that the proportion of black children being victims of murder is far more rampant in the area of abortion.. ergo why louder voices. I don’t think it’s “bible thumpers” either that care about this.
@madisonpriceeee @steph93065 @KamalaHarris Innocent black children are targeted. There are more Planned Parenthood’s in black communities than any other. Do you think that is just coincidental?
@madisonpriceeee @steph93065 @KamalaHarris Ok.Just think you need a more appropriate word.🤔Hypocrisy can’t possibly mean that b/c one wasn’t loud enough for some victims, so can’t be loud for others doesn’t make sense. How do you feel about3rd trimester abortion? Did you know that more blacks are aborted in NY than born?
@madisonpriceeee @steph93065 @KamalaHarris I don’t recall anyone in America being OK with innocent children being shot... just to be clear. I think that is an example of MSM talking point to make the other side of the aisle “the evil ones.” Please tell me you buy in to that crap??
@madisonpriceeee @steph93065 @KamalaHarris When America called out questionable police actions and shootings- many states made it mandatory to wear cameras at all times
@madisonpriceeee @steph93065 @KamalaHarris Important issues is what THEY rely on.. that way, they don’t need to held accountable. Imagine if ALL AMERICANS united against 3rd term abortions! They couldn’t pin us against each other and have to eliminate it..
@madisonpriceeee @steph93065 @KamalaHarris I’m not sure how I was deflecting.. we both have strong feelings about issues that matter to us and we are vocal- as we should be. My point about politicians- is that they don’t really have the same concerns, with few exceptions .. ergo why I’m pointing out that bickering about

@steph93065 @madisonpriceeee @KamalaHarris I don’t think you understand that the elite politicians rely on you to fight against us, conservatives, to distract you from the real issues. Democrats and Republican politicians all smoke cigars together at end of the day- laughing at us. It’s elites vs us.. please help us fight
@madisonpriceeee @steph93065 @KamalaHarris I am all too familiar with their plight.. unfortunately.  I’m not sure you understand at all what you are speaking about.
@steph93065 @madisonpriceeee @KamalaHarris I work with the illegal immigrant population in California- even THEY want a border wall. Young women that escaped their captors are extorted still- because they took advantage of the offer to be walked over the border.
@madisonpriceeee @steph93065 @KamalaHarris Why call someone a hypocrite because they stand up for a life against a murderer? Since when is it hypocritical to stand up for life? Not allowed to because someone else was murdered in a different situation? Honey- I don’t think folks can tweet about every victim in every tweet
@madisonpriceeee @steph93065 @KamalaHarris I will defend kids in cages for a couple of months if it means ONE child isn’t sent on with a predator. Do you have any idea how bad this Child Trafficking issue is?  https://t.co/FAM9rQSwzK

@fauxpunx1 @BuzzFeedNews You have been brainwashed by the right anti-trump controlled oppo party or ignorant folks are. Fusion is a distraction- leading you to same end goal of Dem/Repub globalists.
@dg_phelps @BuzzFeedNews @BUZZARDFEED The dirt WAS THE FVKING TRUTH about Magnitsky Act and Bill Browder. @DonaldJTrumpJr was too stupid to listen
Yeah- Check our Bill Browder 2015 deposition.. compare that to Congress testimony  where is @TheJusticeDept @FBI ? https://t.co/9HW2JzcBNS
@BuzzFeedNews Ummm $500k... and then? How is this any different that the corrupt money Clinton received? Or John podesta and bro? 🤦🏼‍♀️🤪🙄

@Uncle_Jimbo She wasn’t a lobbyist- she is an attorney that knows the lies and corruption surrounding Bill Browder and Magnitsky Act. It’s too bad @DonaldJTrumpJr was an ignorant idiot, and @realDonaldTrump is too wimpy and spineless to expose it.  #Disappointed #TrumpSupporterGoneAngry

@SoCalValleyGal @Swrobles @johncardillo Enough said I wish you a beautiful weekend
@SoCalValleyGal @Swrobles @johncardillo You are still completely missing my point. I’m too tired now of trying to explain it to you. They did not dig it up and that was wrong. In October it could’ve helped us. Raking him over the coals right now does not help our party.

@SoCalValleyGal @Swrobles @johncardillo What part do you disagree with?
@ali My grandmother was racist as I recall. I thought nothing of it in 1989. Thankfully I have matured, grown, and gotten educated.. I guess that won’t mean anything to even my Republican friends.
@ali Whatever. The Republicans have already set a standard at the low level of Democrats. We cannot defend rand Paul or President Trump should a weird photo come out from 35 years ago. God help me if my place of work catches a video of me 10yrs ago- much less 35 years ago.

@SoCalValleyGal @Swrobles @johncardillo Yep! You hold that as a standard. That a photo is racist, and 35yrs means nothing. Great. That’s not my standard for racism. (And a PICTURE CANT BE RACIST!  In adamant object  CANNOT BE RACIST!) but a person CAN BE!) oh well- the Right just set themselves up. Bummer

How Kampala as AG fought to keep black men in prison “free labor? How AOC called all Trump supporters racist?? THAT IS BIGOTRY!  You all r setting us up for no good.

When Kamala Harris defense keeping black man eligible for early release in jail for free labor, that is real racism.
@SoCalValleyGal @Swrobles @johncardillo I’m only wishing for a higher standard for us that’s all.
@SoCalValleyGal @Swrobles @johncardillo Yes. And they do look like that. And yes- everyone sees. So how is conservatives calling this out- as opposed to REAL racism happening now- helping? This is fake racism. Racists are calling him out and we r helping?! 🤦🏼‍♀️ Over a photo?! (That clearly was making fun of racists)
@GRIP2013 Then you do you 👍
@SoCalValleyGal @Swrobles @johncardillo Don’t you see that the Democrats are scrambling and calling for his resignation? If we defended him then we are consistent when we also defend Republicans for a bullshit accusation. Enough said but I really appreciate your discussion with me
@SoCalValleyGal @Swrobles @johncardillo Dude- I know that most people I respect and love are calling for his resignation. I stand by my principles
@SoCalValleyGal @Swrobles @johncardillo Yes we want war on them! This is not the situation to do it. Third term abortion, yes! That is a win. This is not. But go ahead and help them call for his resignation because that helps Republican so much🤦🏼‍♀️
@SoCalValleyGal @Swrobles @johncardillo How so? It’s not like Democrats aren’t holding him accountable. Where’s the win? Ugh- It’s frustrating when folks cannot pull themselves out for a second and think rather than defend their position
@GRIP2013 Missed the point. Go on and keep calling for a resignation. 🙄

@GRIP2013 If he was actually a member of the KKK and was outed for actually lynching somebody, that’s different. This is ridiculous and it will only bite us in the butt if we call for a resignation over it. Let them do it
@GRIP2013 No. I think we are screwed if people will be judged based upon their behavior 35 years ago. That’s ignoring 35 years of growth, maturity, times changing.. Hell no I don’t want to scare her away great leaders because of what they did 35 years ago
@Thunderstruck04 @AP @RantsOutloud Also, there are countless examples of racism in the Democrat party that are factual, by their behaviors and their current speech. That is what needs to be outed
@Thunderstruck04 @AP @RantsOutloud “Hold marxists to their own standards,” ... as they already are. Doesn’t help us in the future to help
@SoCalValleyGal @Swrobles @johncardillo This wasn’t brought up during election time. Fair game during elections. Let the Democrats hurt their own. We don’t need to look like we stand behind that bullshit
@SoCalValleyGal How does calling for a resignation over a 35yo photo help us win? If we r consistent- defend the person, no matter left or right, shows our consistency and principle. This only screws us at the end of the day

@ali So the next time a Republican gets exposed for a photo from 35 years ago we must call for the resignation? I did not do that for Cavanagh your book. Why can we not be consistent to our principles while waging war? Citizens will see no difference in the parties
@ali I don’t understand how it helps conservatives to condemn a man for a photo 35yrs ago.. dems are doing it themselves- don’t need our help.
@la15plunkett Sorry, last word here :  imagine if we defended this man because it’s just a photo from 35 years ago.... So the next Republican that gets exposed for a picture of him at a Lynyrd Skynyrd concert with a confederate patch on his jacket, I can defend as well- consistency.

@JaxBchLady @RalphNortham The abortion issue was a clear win- that got tabled! Now we are talking REAL ISSUES! A photo is dumb
@JaxBchLady @RalphNortham @danbongino Virginia gets an ever farther left Dem. great 🤦🏼‍♀️
@JaxBchLady @RalphNortham @danbongino So?
@SpeakerPelosi A photo can’t be racist.
@JaxBchLady @RalphNortham It’s no win for republicans to promote a resignation over a 35yo photo. Period.
@JaxBchLady @RalphNortham The Left does what it it does.. I oppose identity politics no matter who it is
@JaxBchLady @RalphNortham Did you watch Dukes of hazard in 1984? I did. A photo is an inadamate object- not racist. If he was found to be in kk and actually did something like participate in a lynching-I’d b all over it.

@Realpersonpltcs @Christo22263422 @realDonaldTrump @POTUS You don’t know our President at all. In fact, it’s “Trump supporters “ like you that keeps the people quiet cheerleaders, and Trump has few supporting him that allows him to go against the Repub anti Trumpers.

@on_bender @SolomonC7 @kimmieguy @OmarHamada What are you TALKING ABOUT? That is no example of having to kill a full term baby to save the mother. Moms have to deliver early, some don’t make it.. why kill them??

@wcoolbreeze @realDonaldTrump @TFL1728 @LucyKomisar @stranahan ..to get the info to @realDonaldTrump and insisting on MAGA agenda, exposing the bad guys, getting him to 2020. You can just applaud 👍

No clue about what’s going on. Stick to ur “Clinton is being arrested, Trust Sessions” group. That’s really helped 👍
@wcoolbreeze @realDonaldTrump @JackPosobiec @Cernovich @ali So how do you explain their stance now? Losing viewership because folks think (or not think) like you.. do they care?? NO! Because they have principles! Unlike blind supporters that like clicks. If they about money- wouldn’t that be different?
@wcoolbreeze @realDonaldTrump .. and explains the weak Trump supporter base
@wcoolbreeze @realDonaldTrump Did they threaten violence? Cuz as far as I know, THAT is the only thing that can halt free speech legally. The fact that you just made an excuse to halt free speech, tells a lot
@wcoolbreeze @realDonaldTrump .... what?!!! Do you realize what you just said??? 🤦🏼‍♀️
@wcoolbreeze @realDonaldTrump @JackPosobiec @Cernovich @ali But that doesn’t even matter- they put more hours and money in to Trump than anyone that is picking on them now.
@wcoolbreeze @realDonaldTrump @JackPosobiec @Cernovich @ali And I guarantee u did too- but don’t realize it. They helped his campaign, literally.
@wcoolbreeze @realDonaldTrump @JackPosobiec @Cernovich @ali That’s false. Just because YOU didn’t know of them, many in the nation became woke to Obama BS because of them.. do u know anything about the Deploraball?? Inauguration party? Don’t pretend u know if u don’t.
