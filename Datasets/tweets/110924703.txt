@JustRocco @dtannebaumon7 @kcarrilloon7 @scejas Hmmm... to be presented at #RNC2012? I think I like that idea.
@JustRocco @dtannebaumon7 @kcarrilloon7 @scejas It's imaginary? I think you need to fix that.
#RNC2012 Trivia answer: The Anti-Masonic Party was the first to use the national convention, which met in Baltimore in September 1831.
‚Äú@mseyfang: @GOPconvention Anti-Masonic Party, Baltimore, 1831‚Äù That's right, Matt! You tied @dtannebaumon7!
‚Äú@dtannebaumon7: anti-masonic party, 1831, Baltimore  #TriviaTeam7‚Äú @kcarrilloon7 @scejas @JustRocco   @GOPconvention: Getting warmer‚Äù‚Äù YEP!
@MichaelChrist1 It's wrong, I promise.
#RNC2012 Trivia: It's a 3-part question. What party was the first to have a convention, where and when did it take place?
@MichaelChrist1 Very close though

‚Äú@JustRocco: @GOPconvention Reps Philadelphia 1856?@dtannebaumon7 @scejas @kcarrilloon7‚Äù Nope!
