@Paul_Lee_Cruz @BethShell @ifoneaddict @cnnbrk When you say McCabe you're referring to his wife right? How is he  corrupt when it was his spouse  accepting donations? If he's doing his job (nothing says otherwise) it's none of our business who he voted for.  Country over Party, just part of the job.
@realDonaldTrump You do realize that most of your WH staff have used non secure personal email accts while you've been in office, right? God knows what they've deleted. Also those funds you gloat about I believe were donated in 2015 to his WIFE.
You are so right "THOUSANDS" have stock, 401K's &amp; portfolios. But what about the "MILLIONS" that don't because they live paycheck to paycheck (if lucky) and can't afford to invest? #Clueless #faketaxcuts #whiteprivelege @IngrahamAngle https://t.co/DpeoXs0nOL
Well THANK YOU for the extra $8000 I'll make while the tax cut "benefits" me. NOW please remind me how much I'll be losing once this oh so gracious gift ends? #faketaxcuts https://t.co/V483XnKuvO

Yeah..and now let's fight to get rid of mandated home &amp; car insurance. My car &amp; home are fine, why should I have to pay for something I'm not using. Wait except for that time a hurricane passed by my house. Your tax bill sucks. https://t.co/U76TgMPPPS

@PressSec This is the most dumb ass thing I've read all week. If making low income families get health ins seems cruel, why aren't you as offended the govt forces them to get home &amp; car ins as well? What a cruel irony. Do you see now how dumb your comment was?
