@w_terrence @KamalaHarris You need to stop attacking this woman for doing her job, it's despicable.. She hasn't even gotten her campaign underway and the undermining of her record is obscene. Stop.

@brian_wright4 @tariqnasheed Yes! I know she has an uphill battle because she is an intelligent, politically astute, savvy legislator.  Oh wait, that isn’t the reason.  She’s also (gasp) a woman, (gasp) of color, who is beautiful and articulate and tough as nails.  Love her. She's not perfect.

@EliteT89 Kamala Harris is the best &amp; frankly the only choice we, as Dems have. We’re in this to win this &amp; she is who were counting on to bring home the victory! She represents the future of the party &amp; IS the future of our nation. A brilliant orator &amp; a talented polical mind. Let's unite

@MissBlackMe @tariqnasheed Hahahahahaha,  I  will vote for anyone that will take down Trump...period!
@Mike_Clarke_ @tariqnasheed In the end, I'll vote for anyone who takes the primaries. I'm voting statistically in favor of shutting down the GOP candidate (seemingly Trump already based on recent news). No voting for "can't win" candidates, and no NOT voting for a "can win" Dem!!!
@Ayiti12 @tariqnasheed I will, thanks!
@tariqnasheed I am just saying that I want to hear what can offer as candidate, if doesn't sit well with me, I  will move on that all. She's the best we have right now to beat Trump.  If Biden decides to run, I am jumping ship. America is not ready for a black female.
@SeanNeville9 @tariqnasheed Lol

@tariqnasheed @BrianDupree2 No I am not  ok with all her policies, I just want us to gave her a chance and hear her out! So if she wins the primary, I shouldn't vote her because of some of mistakes she made in her past, that's not fair. Let's give her a chance please 🤗
@tariqnasheed @BrianDupree2 My ancestors were slaves also, but my great grandfather decided to go back when they were asked by President Lincoln. Your great grandfather and mothers decided to stayed. I  understand and appreciate all the sacrifices made by those decided to stayed.
