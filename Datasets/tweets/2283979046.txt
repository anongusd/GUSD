We're in the second half of the #GreatLakesPresident forum at #HOW16 We're hearing from David Hayes on behalf of the Clinton campaign.
What next in #Waukesha? A lot of watchdogging, enforcement, continuing to make adjustments to the process that didn't work as well. #HOW16 https://t.co/YFUApBZ7X9

A #GreatLakesPresident can be the difference between big plans and funded restoration. Today's forum is an opportunity to hear plans. #HOW16
Appreciate the #HOW16 forum to look at issues for a #GreatLakesPresident. First up, Mike Budzik representing the Trump campaign.
2.6 million miles of pipelines exist in the U.S. Could the oil in #Line5 go through one of them? #HOW16
Putting together a good risk assessment for a #Line5 event is important. What's the "worst case scenario?" #HOW16
#Line5 discussion is important for those responsible for observations. Are we prepared to monitor spills in this challenging space? #HOW16
Engaging new constituents. Inform (share story) dialogue (support each other) ask (adapt to meet other's needs) #growth #HOW16

#HOW16 #Cleveland material is coarse grain, marketable. #Toledo is fine grained, lots of water in the initial volume. #sediment
#HOW16 stopping #sediment from getting in at all is less expensive. Material can cost $1 a yard captured before dredging, $17 after.
Don't treat #sediment as a problem, treat it as marketable inventory. Proper "choreography" breaks material into commodity.  #HOW16
#HOW16 #Cleveland dredges 200-250k yards of #sediment annually.
#HOW16 Why do we dredge? #sediment gets removed because every inch loss of draft equals the loss of 110 tons of cargo.
Some #Toledo work on #sediment use has to wait until the end of the walleye run. #HOW16 #LakeErie #fisheries #GreatLakes
#Toledo #sediment goes to the #GreatLakes Material Center for Innovation. Working to add capacity for beneficial use in farm fields. #HOW16
Dredging maintains "marine highways." 50k truckloads of #sediment don't get used beneficially without collaboration. #Toledo #HOW16
#Toledo port established in 1955 around the time the #StLawrenceSeaway opened. 7k jobs, a billion dollars annual revenue. #HOW16 #sediment
Seventy percent of material dredged from #Ohio harbors annually comes from #Toledo and #Cleveland. The #sediment can be a resource. #HOW16
Most dredged material from #Ohio harbors is now disposed of in #LakeErie. New law means hardly any #sediment allowed in open water. #HOW16

Annin:There have been 8 inter-Basin and 6 intra-Basin diversions since 1825. Source @IJCsharedwaters #IAGLR2014
