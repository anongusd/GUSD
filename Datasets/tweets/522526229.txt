Clinton again endorses PP and founder Sanger who targeted "human weeds." Who are they? Minorities, disabled, last kids of big families.
Hillary Clinton affirmed no rights for boys and girls day of birth. Remember  her code:women's health care means abortion.
Finally HRC getting asked her position on late term. Is her answer clear?  She is for Partial Birth abortion because "fetus" has not rights.
RT @TaraAnnThieke: @marjoriesba Precisely.
So she opposes no rights for unborn "not one or two or three days before birth." Yes no one has that right.
Trump explains well what partial birth abortions are.
That is what partial birth abortion is HRC.
