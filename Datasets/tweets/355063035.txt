@dennisdiclaudio @andizeisler ok, so same media 2 weeks before last election, sayin' Hillary 87%, white guys dont even get off your couches to vote are same demonizing Warren and stuttering progress?  this is circular logic at this point
@dennisdiclaudio @andizeisler which is .. what?  progress isnt occurring at the correct speed?  or that the media is at fault?
@dennisdiclaudio @andizeisler that was hardly a declaration towards the media .. in fact, she implied ALL men are cat/mousing their equality .. on the same day of historic turnover
@dennisdiclaudio @andizeisler im aware .. then how many new women walked into Congress today?  you focusing on what the media said instead of the results in your puddin'?
@dennisdiclaudio @andizeisler thus the undoing of progress i mentioned before ..
@dennisdiclaudio @andizeisler so whining about likability/ or how seriously institutional sexism will allow these women to be seems like the same type of emotional Meryl Streptdom stereotype she claims is holding her down ..
@dennisdiclaudio @andizeisler the answer is yes .. which means ..obviously enough of these women were likable/taken seriously enough to have occurred, yes?  or did i miss something?
