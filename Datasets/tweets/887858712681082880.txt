@samhsagov Most chronic pain patients depend on every pill they get just 4 pain &amp; most don't misuse their meds.

@notyours_2 @JulianGroveMD You got lucky ur PCP was prescribing ur meds 4 as long as he did. I didn't mind switching 2 a PM, it was actually better 4 me. I would definitely check into seeing a Pain Management Doc, if u find 1 like Dr. Grove who truly cares about the well being of his patients.
@TheOldHouseBC @JulianGroveMD I know right, if my doc was as honest as Dr. Grove I could have an open &amp; honest convo w/him. But 4 the moment its hard 4 a lot of us 2 b too honest 4 the fear that if we r they dont want 2 deal w/difficult patients like us but we have good reason we want 2 keep what meds we get
@JulianGroveMD Thanks Doc, I have a feeling it's going to get worse b4 it gets better. I'm trying 2 research my best pain alternatives/options for the worst case scenario. Dry needling, acupuncture, physical therapy, water therapy, abalation, trigger points &amp; if I get cut off I guess CBD oil
@JulianGroveMD Education is key n medical school &amp; CE classes 4 knowing how 2 treat patients w/pain. That's 1 thing I absolutely hate about bureaucracy is the vagueness 2 interpret things the way u think they should be. I applaud u for staying n ur field &amp; helping the ones that truly need it.
@JulianGroveMD I'm truly hoping this pendulum wont take a few yrs 2 swing back 2 midline but you're probably right.  I mean we're currently feeling the effects of this "opioid crisis" from 2015-16 &amp; it really started n the early 2000's when PCP's prescribed pain meds @ the drop of a hat.

Shocked that this was happening. Also I've been telling him since Jan that my fentanyl &amp; tramadol combo hasnt ben working but after I told him the issues I've been having locating my meds he took me off both &amp; put me back on hydrocodone. He said maybe there is a stigma 2 fentanyl
I shared my real concerns abt ne taking fentanyl to my PM doc Monday &amp; how 4 the past 2 months I've had 2 go to a diff pharmacy 2 find the meds bcuz CVS said the gov't has slowed production of that med &amp; they cant order as much so in turn they cant keep it n stock, my PM looked
All these overinflated numbers of people dying from legally prescribed pain meds from 2015 to 2018 is insane. Y cant anyone come up w/the real #'s? I've seen @ least 5 diff articles on ppl dying of OD's &amp; they r all diff #'s. The CDC admitted 2 overinflating the death toll...SMH
The "War on opioids" should read "the War on illicit fentanyl shipped n from Asia &amp; Mexico, heroin, meth &amp; MJ laced w/carfentanil" but yet we - Chronic Pain Patients - r getting the brunt of the blame bcuz we r legally prescribed pain meds	It's BS &amp; political rhetoric ü§¨ü§¨ü§¨
@SGottliebFDA I agree there's docs out there that r stil considered "pill mills" but those few r ruining everything 4 CPP who've been stable 4 years &amp; never had any problems w/their meds or addiction. We maybe dependent on our meds but we r not unlike a diabetic dependent on meds @SGottliebFDA
@SGottliebFDA My PM doc &amp; every other doc is afraid 2 prescribe what he thinks is medically necessary due 2 the DEA's actions &amp; vague letters sent 2 their offices stating stay within the 90MME or they will b prosecuted. Docs need better training when it comes to pain @SGottliebFDA
@SGottliebFDA The wording for the 2019 Medicare guide needs 2 b more concise when it comes 2 "CHRONIC PAIN PATIENTS" so my PM doc knows how 2 treat a patient like me (I was deemed permanently disabled 16 yrs ago by a social security judge) &amp; I've been on pain meds 4 over 20 yrs @SGottliebFDA
@ThomasKlineMD Why is the DEA &amp; CDC sending vague &amp; threatening letter 2 PM docs saying U must stay w/in the 90MME 4 patients? Ppl like me who the gov't deemed disabled 16 yrs ago &amp; have been on pain mgt 4 20 yrs r still getting tapered but y? Bcuz these letters aren't clarifying how 2 treat us
@NIH When r we going 2 get more clarification on patients like me, chronic pain patients? Why do I keep seeing conflicting data on overdose deaths n different articles?  What r the true numbers? Why dont coroners differentiate between illegal drug ODs &amp; prescribed meds? #PainMonth18
@NIH #PainMonth18 I agree there was an issue with some docs overprescribing pain meds but that seems to be over &amp; yet PM docs are still getting vague &amp; threatening letters from CDC, FDA, DEA &amp; Medicare so they don't know how to treat truly disabled patients like me (16 yrs &amp; counting)
@NIH @NINDSdirector My question is, I've been a chronic pain patient for 20 years, I was put on permanent disability n 2002 so 16 years ago &amp; I'm currently being tapered down atm, I'm @ 30% pain relief. I'm not seeing much n the way of how to treat patients like me yet I'm still being tapered 40MME

@JenBaresAll @downtowin I was on suboxone for about 6 months 10 years ago &amp; it didn't help with my pain at all.  Back then I was on way too many pills, 3-90mg morphine a day and 10-12 10/325mg hydrocodones wo suboxone helped with the immense withdrawal I went thru but definitely not pain.

After I was diagnosed with  torn stomach lining the ER insisted their pain clinic see me. I've been on pain meds since but I've been tampered by 56% since my first visit
@JenBaresAll @downtowin Said they would only prescribe me suboxone, which I absolutely don't want to be on. I tried it for 6 months per my pain doctors request &amp; it did nothing for my pain &amp; I was miserable.
@JenBaresAll @downtowin You don't think if I demand to talk about changing my meds with him that he won't find some excuse to terminate me.  I've heard horror stories about patients getting fired for no good reason &amp; finding a doctor that will prescribe what I'm on. I tried to move doctors &amp; all of them
@michelleziemba 12mcg Fentanyl, its the lowest dose but those 2 combined I get a label or at least that's how they made me feel. When I first started there I was on 100MME now I'm 43.8MME so I've been cut down by 56% on my meds &amp; I'm only getting worse.
@michelleziemba They have an online access site, I can send a note to, seeing as they only answer the phone 1 out of 50 times I call. Yes I've been on all the standard pain meds- oxycodone, hydrocodone, tylenol 3 &amp; 4, the best is 10/325mg hydrocodone but there's a stigma behind it. Plus I'm on

It was an all day n night cycle until I went to sleep. Slept for 3 hours at most &amp; took more til 1 night I started throwing up bright red blood torn stomach lining
@ThomasKlineMD Ny pain clinic makes me get them on one of my 3 sections of my back every 90 days or they won't prescribe my meds, even though I've been diagnosed with Arachnoiditis.  They don't believe I have it even though I was diagnosed via CT scan.

@Brenda82964799 They stopped taking Medicare.  I've told him each time the tramadol &amp; the patch isn't working &amp; before it was doing ok, I was losing weight due 2 me being able 2 do some physical activity &amp; now its not working to the point that I can barely get off the couch &amp; walk 2 the bathroom
@Brenda82964799 Meds for my turn stomach lining, when I couldn't access any pain meds 3 years ago I was taking 1000mg tylenol then 2 hours later 1000mg of ibuprofen in a constant cycle until I went to bed, i almost died then got in with my previous pain doc but had to stop going to that one cuz
@Brenda82964799 I'm wondering if I'm saying something wrong or maybe not communicating enough on how I can't get around due to my pain.  They have me on fentanyl 12mcg every 72 hours &amp; 50mg tramadol 3 times a day &amp; other various meds 4 muscle spasms, sleep, chronic migraines, high cholesterol &amp;
@Brenda82964799 Yes @Brenda82964799 I've been telling the NP since Jan my meds haven't been working.  I see him every 3 months, he says he's going to discuss my concerns with the the pain doc &amp; he comes back &amp; always says he doesn't feel like things should change @ this point.
I haven't seen my pain doctor in over a year, only the nurse practitioner.  Been telling him since January the tramadol isn't working with no results.  I go get injections by my doc next Thursday what should I say to make him see me in office about my current medications?
@tal7291 After I couldn't access the proper pain meds I started taking 1000mg of tylenol then 2 hours later 1000mg of ibuprofen.  Needless to say I tore my stomach lining &amp; could've died but got lucky

@sammill01550904 No I 100% agree with you.  I definitely wouldn't want to pay for someone's transition but it should be in the paperwork when they sign up
@Deborah271303 @andrewkolodny I agree
@Deborah271303 @andrewkolodny So sad I'm sorry for your loss.  My nephew used to be an addict heroin was his choice but it did start with Vicodin. He's been clean 4 2 yrs
@Deborah271303 @andrewkolodny Also she was abusing the pain meds, most chronic pain patients r only dependent on them.  There's huge difference in addiction &amp; dependence
@Deborah271303 @andrewkolodny People can't do that now, docs know when patients doctor shop &amp; so do pharmacies, there's a national database now
@andrewkolodny You should think about revising said guidelines to include us &amp; leave it up to our docs to decide how to treat us without fear of jail.
@andrewkolodny And yet you @andrewkolodny have personally made mine &amp; many other chronic pain patients lives a living hell with these new CDC guidelines.
@andrewkolodny I'm a true chronic pain patient &amp; it hasn't been "easy" to get my meds. I don't misuse/abuse my meds. I take a UA every month with no issues
@ParkerKane46 @KarylKrug @WhiteHouse But nobody has come up with a good solution yet. I only get $1079 a month disability to live on &amp; I know I can't afford those alternatives
@ParkerKane46 @KarylKrug @WhiteHouse Agree the infrastructure  (insurance companies) need to change before the problem can be dealt with properly
@ParkerKane46 @KarylKrug @WhiteHouse I agree but my Medicare won't cover those things
@WhiteHouse Wait til you holy rollers need meds after a surgery &amp; can only get 3 days worth because of these new stupid CDC guidelines
@WhiteHouse Take note politicians don't forget about the chronic pain patients who really need these meds we r caught in a loophole while fighting this
Addiction and dependence is two totally different things!!!
@LynnRWebsterMD It's impossible to tell because heroin metabolize out as fentanyl.  The powers that be can't be that ignorant.
