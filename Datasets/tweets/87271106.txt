@BlairReeves @deftlyinane @ourstatemag I've never been convinced that the gold mining had anything to do with the modern banking industry, but it's certainly a great story in its own right.
@paytheline11 Yes. Bank of America was acquired by Charlotte's Nationsbank in 1998. The Charlotte company kept the San Francisco bank's name.
(My first job in business journalism was covering banking for the Charlotte Observer, so I'm tripping down memory lane this morning.) /fin
For more on all of this, check out this book by my old beat mate Rick Rothacker:		https://t.co/Hf4kAvZRLq
Second, why Charlotte? It was not one of North Carolina‚Äôs old and hidebound cities. It was so desperate for growth it even allowed restaurants to serve alcohol. And so now BBT, the last of the big NC banks that wasn‚Äôt in Charlotte, is moving there.
First, why Bank of America? The answer is basically former chief executive Hugh McColl, a former Marine who liked to give crystal hand grenades to aides after completing an acquisition.
That set up the North Carolina banks to come roaring out of the gate when the era of truly national banking began. But our story has two more twist.
In the 1980s, when the modern era of bank mergers began, the confederate states created a Southern Regional Banking Compact to keep out New York banks. That allowed the North Carolina banks to eat their regional rivals.
Well‚Ä¶ our story begins after the Great Depression, when many states restricted ‚Äúbranch banking,‚Äù limits banks to a single location. North Carolina did not, so its banks were able to grow. One of those banks was called‚Ä¶ ‚ÄúBranch Banking &amp; Trust Co.‚Äù
Charlotte, home to two of the nation's four largest banks before the financial crisis, will now be home to two of the six largest banks: Bank of America and the merger of BB&amp;T and SunTrust. 		Maybe you're wondering why Charlotte is a banking hub?
@BrianOCTweet https://t.co/FFgwfzf0tB

In the wake of 2008, SunTrust cared so little about helping homeowners facing foreclosure that it stuffed aid applications into a storage room - so many aid applications that the floor literally collapsed.

@PotomacRC @dandolfa I'm not passing judgment on the extent of that relationship. As a matter of history, however, the Fed has often behaved as if there is a causal or at least sequential relationship. To the extent it has done so, the questions in this thread arise.
@gabriel_mathy Thank you
@dandolfa The Fed will raise interest rates when it should allow wage gains at the expense of capital (or, per Barkai, at the expense of rentiers).
@dandolfa If increases in labor share are mistakenly interpreted as inflationary (and, for that matter, if decreases in labor share are mistakenly interpreted as deflationary) it seems plausible the conduct of monetary policy will be systematically biased against sustainable wage growth.
@dandolfa In all seriousness, I think there's a theoretically plausible mechanism here by which the Fed may be contributing to what is clearly a secular trend. And I'm skeptical that we can judge the merits of that account by eyeballing the chart.
@dandolfa It's a butterfly. Right?
@dandolfa Yes, this.
@dandolfa Labor share is in long-term decline, for reasons not directly related to monetary policy, so you'll actually see deterioration under those circumstances, but...
@dandolfa Sure, but the point is that raising rates ends the period in which wage gains occur.

@conorsen @karlbykarlsmith @KarandikarAkhil You should not. There is no theoretical justification for 2 percent. Bernanke and Yellen will tell you as much. The basic argument for remaining at 2 percent, rather than, say, 3 percent, or 4 percent, is about transition costs, not the merits of 2 percent as such.
@karlbykarlsmith @KarandikarAkhil @conorsen The US settled a little higher than that, basically because Janet Yellen won an argument with Alan Greenspan in the mid-1990s. https://t.co/Q9mtSNtG6W
@karlbykarlsmith @KarandikarAkhil @conorsen New Zealand picked a range of 0-2 percent in the late 1980s because they wanted to target zero inflation, and it was generally agreed that standard measures of inflation were a little biased to the upside, and that targeting is an imprecise art. So it was 1, plus or minus one.
Another note: The Fed is not the only culprit, by any means. Here's a good overview of other factors. https://t.co/svmdOpK2RL
(An interesting note on this chart (well, interesting to me) is that labor share usually increased during recessions, because companies hold on to workers even as output declines. But those gains are ephemeral. The problem is the long-term downward trend.) https://t.co/Stpqft1Cd4
Faust, by the way, is now a senior adviser to Fed Chairman Jerome H. Powell. Here's the paper he and Leeper wrote back in 2015.	https://t.co/lcbzgmifGu
It raises the question of whether the Fed has systematically favored employers by stepping in to "prevent inflation" every time workers get a little bargaining power, thus contributing to a long-term decline in labor share.
Want to read more? Try my story. https://t.co/cVeTSOtcWr
Well, the Fed started raising rates, giving inflation as the reason, and here's what has happened to the "labor share" -- the workers' part of the economic pie. https://t.co/WQZf5ZhbBB
Rising wages can lead to inflation, if companies find the money by increasing prices. But companies also can find money by curtailing profits, giving workers a larger share of the American pie without increasing inflation.
In 2015, the economists Jon Faust and Eric Leeper warned the Fed to be careful as it raised interest rates to make sure it was fighting inflation rather than protecting the profit margins of corporations and the dividends of shareholders.

@jbouie This is correct except that N. Virginia needs a massive building spree, irrespective of Amazon's plans, to *restore* affordability.
@jodiecongirl @jbarro @rortybomb An incomplete solution at best. Some incentives are in the local but not the national interest.
@jbarro @rortybomb It's also quite plausible that even a successful law would simply succeed in spawning new forms of subsidies. But that's not an argument against trying. Making it marginally harder to give away money could still be worthwhile.
@AlanMCole OK, I was with you right up until "Rosslyn is the most beautiful part of the DC area."
@jbarro @rortybomb We already have armies of tax laywers. We might as well put them to work doing something potentially useful.
@dandrezner @RepGallagher The irony of this piece is that the changes he cites as concentrating power in leadership were enacted to break the power of "committee barons." Members felt powerless under the old system too.

@rortybomb (Key passage: "The solution is straightforward: Congress should institute a federal tax of 100 percent on every dollar a business receives in state or local incentives that are directed specifically to that company.")
@rortybomb This seems worth thinking about: https://t.co/wlf0Z6QRMi
@BenDWalsh In fairness, if you increase the total number of tech jobs in New York, you increase the total number of tech workers in New York. (The people Amazon hires will need to be replaced at their current jobs, etc.)
New York does have a long history of overpaying for stars from other cities.
A better deal for Virginia would be investing $1 billon in this new campus and not giving tax incentives to tech companies.

@ATabarrok Yes. Which is why it's so ridiculous for the White House to describe the expansion of Medicare as the advent of socialism.
The premise of fact-checking is that people are generally and substantially truthful and can and should be held to account for occasional deviations.		I'm not convinced that it's possible or productive to fact-check a fabulist.
In the past few hours the White House warned that terrorists are heading for the southern border and socialists are trying to take over the government and it has promised to shower the middle class with a new tax cut.		None of this has even the slightest connection with reality.
In my view, such behavior is different than Trump's public attacks on the Fed.		Private pressure is probably more effective than public attacks (which is why most presidents choose that path).		Also, while bad, it may be less damaging to the institution in the long run.
To my knowledge, Volcker's book is the first public disclosure of this story.		It takes its place in a long history of presidents privately pressuring the Fed.
In a forthcoming book, Paul Volcker says that President Reagan (via Baker) ordered him not to raise interest rates in 1984, during the presidential election. 		https://t.co/27HCBpmgqz https://t.co/It7dwboVfY

@opinion_joe I‚Äôd refer you to the story but the short version is that tariffs are touted as preserving jobs (at high cost). In this case, the jobs were lost in Ohio and new jobs created in S. Carolina. At high cost.

@jeffcarp Also, one would need a story about how the tariffs are narrowing China‚Äôs underlying advantage to explain why the tariffs could be removed without losing the jobs. What is that story?
@jeffcarp Consider the example of tire tariffs:		1. Even if the tariffs were dropped after three years, it would take 75 years for the payroll savings to equal the short-term cost to consumers. 		2. We‚Äôre now in the sixth year.
@yeselson Read the story :-)
One consequence of tariffs that doesn‚Äôt get much attention: Foreign companies are drawn to the U.S.		That may sound like a victory. It‚Äôs actually a very expensive defeat. 		https://t.co/5UfZGaG8vW
Tariffs can induce foreign companies to move factories to the US. Instead of preserving domestic jobs at great expense, Americans end up paying for new jobs in new places. 		https://t.co/5UfZGaG8vW
Tax incidence is complicated, and the impact of tariffs depends on a wide range of variables.		One thing that is clear: The U.S. is not collecting billions of dollars in tariffs from the Chinese.
Sometimes tariffs can even impose the greater cost on the exporting nation, as in this paper that estimated 60 percent of the cost of U.S. sugar tariffs fell on exporters, and 40 percent on domestic consumers.	https://t.co/eFdqMls8dX
Tariffs do impose a cost on China. They need to find other places to sell goods that could have been sold to the U.S., and/or they may need to accept lower prices.
President Trump said earlier today that tariffs on Chinese imports are paid by the Chinese. That's not true. Tariffs are paid by importers, and the cost, generally speaking, is passed along to the eventual consumers.
The Trump administration plans to announce a large tax increase on American consumers this evening. "Tariff" is just a fancy word for "tax."

Powell did not make the case as forcefully. Perhaps he does not believe it as strongly. But at least some of the market reaction today struck me as paying insufficient attention to the fact that we have a new Fed chairman.

You wanted someone fast and strong, and when they came bowling down the street at bidding time, look out. One guy who worked near the Fed back then told me that his firm had a back door entrance that opened on race way... (2/x)

Important note: Trump's views about what's good for business don't necessarily coincide with the views of business executives. Notably, he thinks trade is bad and they generally think that trade is good.

@MichaelSLinden @portereduardo Same effect as Bush tax cuts: Larger deficits that eventually led to spending constraints.
@MichaelSLinden @portereduardo Medicare part D is an obvious counterexample. But more broadly, lawmakers have chosen not to break that wall. All the money goes to the Treasury, and Congress decides how to spend it.
@MichaelSLinden @portereduardo Ah, fair point. Although I'd note that NDD has also been squeezed by the priority placed on entitlement programs, at any given level of federal revenues.
@MichaelSLinden @portereduardo That's certainly true. Why is it complicating?
@Aarondklein Perhaps you mean, "Feed the elderly and the military, starve the rest."
@portereduardo And there's another problem: This is the third time the GOP has moved sharply reduce federal revenue, but it never actually follows through on spending cuts. "Starve the Beast," in practice, is actually "Refuse to Pay for the Beast's Food." (5/5)
@portereduardo But this year, federal receipts as a share of GDP is running a little below 18 percent. Over the next decade, without the tax bill, CBO projects it will average 18.2 percent. The government is already taking a smaller share of the economic pie. (4/x)
@portereduardo In 2001, federal receipts as a share of GPD approached 20 percent of the first time. The government's footprint really was larger than it had ever been before. And once again, Republicans responded by sharply cutting taxes. (3/x)
@portereduardo In 1981, federal receipts as a share of GDP approached 19 percent for the first time since WWII. It wasn't crazy to think that the government was taking a larger share of the pie -- nor unreasonable to debate how much it should take. (2/x)

5. Republicans have yet to produce a model that supports their claims. 		So whatever McConnell means by "economists," he is not talking about people who are using the tools of economics to assess this important question.		They may be economists, but they are not doing economics.
4. Serious economists assess this kind of question using models -- formulas -- that require assumptions about both the impetus to investment, and the extent of an offsetting increase in interest rates. These are educated guesses; opinions will vary.
3. Most economists think that those benefits are offset if the changes result in a larger federal debt. That's because higher interest rates also discourage investment. (Personal income tax cuts that increase inflation could also lead to higher rates, reducing the benefits.)
2. Corporate investment has been weak since the recession. There is broad agreement that the tax code is inefficient, which is a fancy way of saying that it discourages some worthwhile investments. So it's perfectly plausible to argue changes/cuts will have economic benefits.
1. There is no serious case for the economic benefits of a personal income tax cut under present circumstances. You must either argue that corporate tax cuts will be so good we can afford to cut personal taxes too, or that the government should be much smaller than it is today. https://t.co/pOQsmqe4Kb

The Illinois legislature investigated, the university was exonerated, and Walgreen endowed a chair for $500,000 by way of apology.
Walgreen, a retail magnate, withdrew his niece from the university in 1936, charging that she was being taught "free love and communism."

@TimWillard3 @DK_Husker @ElShowstopper More to the point, I suspect 99 percent of people would be fine with exempting farms from the estate tax. The argument is a straw man.
@TimWillard3 @DK_Husker @ElShowstopper USDA estimates 160 farms were subject to estate taxation in 2016 -- 0.42 percent of farms owned by someone who died. https://t.co/LlytC0rd6Q
@TimWillard3 @ElShowstopper @DK_Husker (The average farm, meanwhile, is 434 acres -- and that includes corporate farms.)
@TimWillard3 @ElShowstopper @DK_Husker USDA says the average price for an acre of farmland is $3,080. At that rate, a couple would need to own 3,600 acres.
