Anyone defending MS-13 killers should be ashamed of themselves...under no circumstances should there be criticism of Trump for calling them what they are...I'VE NEVER WITNESSED SUCH BIAS HATRED IN MY LIFETIME!! #DISGUSTING https://t.co/V1yqMFSoUV
For Pelosi to defend human animals who torture, rape and decapitate our innocent fellow Americans,  speaks  volumes to the left base...MS-15 illegal killers should not under any circumstances be defended...SHAME ON YOU, PELOSI!!! You're sicker than I ever imagined you could be! https://t.co/xx2EZZzrtn
Something doesn't seem right with Jeff Sessions...either someone's got something on him or he was never with Trump in the first place...#SUSPICIOUS https://t.co/GtJuwAfZhH

Funny to hear the words "lame duck" coming from Nancy Pelosi's lips...Someone please help her off the stage and onto the bus...it's time to retire...it's hard watching her struggle for names, words and figures...where's her family?? https://t.co/1xtW3b3jhi
Start the bus for Nancy...it's always sad and embarrassing when a person doesn't know when to retire...why be remembered as an old bag who can't complete a thought and stumbles for names and figures??! Isn't there a staff or family member who can speak with her?? https://t.co/OsfGTHhX5U

Hand the documents the hell over...get off the hamster wheel and put an end to this fiasco...good money is being thrown at garbage...America has much better use for the $...believe me....look around...I still see people in need...Americans should be demanding funding be cut off! https://t.co/L6vqs1Ifpd
