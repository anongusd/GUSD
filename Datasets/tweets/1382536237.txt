@JackPosobiec Yeah &amp; Trump was going to give Putin a Penthouse Suite in Trump Tower Moscow...

@KimStrassel @politicalelle @WSJopinion Come on Kim - simply an opportunity for Southern District/Mueller's proxy prosecution team....to whip up the Lefties with Russian Lawyer/Trump Tower/Don Jr./Obstruction all in the same headline.

@KatTimpf So is the decision then for society to decide whether or not to provide a safety net to said adult who decides to use drugs, much to the detriment of society. RIGHT?
@mitchellvii Ploy to take wind out of Trump Sails.  Opportunity to get Trump Associate &amp; Russian in the same sentence. 		Just as Southern District charges Russian Lawyer in Trump Tower Meeting for...wait for it....Obstruction...in a matter totally unrelated to Trump Campaign.  See the play?

@SarahPalinUSA NINE additional seats in Congress House of Reps due to counting illegals in the Census. W/ 2020 Census around the corner...		Newsome is looking for a few more. 9 out of 53-robbing Federal resources from Ohio, Georgia, South Dakota, West Virginia, etc.		Really?	@SpeakerPelosi
@AnnCoulter Along w/ willingness to share technology for tunnel detection &amp; drone intercept. Quite a bit to learn from Israel w/ regard to National Security.
@RealSaavedra What we are witnessing is a violation of an alleged college education.
@KatTimpf E-Verify is great for companies who follow process. Requires ubiquitous implementation, else the Illegal gets hired by the next company down the block.		However, does nothing to stop Drug flow, Sex Trade, Criminal aliens, etc.	Watch Aaron Hull: https://t.co/HZkw3vXbqw		Walls work

@AshtonBSpencer @ReaganBattalion Common knowledge that even Marx didn't believe that power/wealth would be transition from the Bourgeois to the Proletariat in a peaceful manner.   Thus 100 Million + DEAD in the name of Marxism.
@TheFive @JesseBWatters @JESSEWATTERS Did they ask you what pronoun you prefer?
@AshtonBSpencer @ReaganBattalion Common knowledge.  Good luck!
@AshtonBSpencer @ReaganBattalion Do your homework. "there is only one way in which the murderous death agonies of the old society and the bloody birth throes of the new society can be shortened, simplified and concentrated, and that way is revolutionary terror." Karl Marx	https://t.co/J1mBo1iEfr
@AshtonBSpencer @ReaganBattalion What is the transition Einstein?   It‚Äôs going to be a rough 6 years for you.
@AshtonBSpencer @ReaganBattalion There's a great documentary for you to watch...Heaven on Earth, the Rise and Fall of Socialism.    Part 1 here...https://t.co/k8R0y2oX2V   Good luck on your premise that he defends dictators.
@AshtonBSpencer @ReaganBattalion Fully understand the tenets of Marxism and how the left leverages cultural Marxist narratives.   You‚Äôve just unmasked your ignorance in equating Trump to a dictator.
@AshtonBSpencer @ReaganBattalion Get real.   Did Mao employ a Marxist playbook in ‚Äúthe cultural revolution‚Äù.
@AshtonBSpencer @ReaganBattalion Yeah - Marx and Engels were shocked that the Proletariat was mostly satisfied with their "exploitation".thus the armed revolution was necessary via Trotsky/Lenin/Mao/Pol Pot/Castro, etc. 100 Million souls slaughtered.  The Marxist revolution evolved. Read the Higgins memo.

@Millie__Weaver Last one...what do Marxism and Islamic Fascism have in common?  A partnership to destroy American ideals.  Read the Higgins memo.  You see it with the Marxist funding the Islamic "invasion" of the EU &amp; you see it here with the "Caravans".  https://t.co/0GrPCOC6Da
@Millie__Weaver Where did "liberation theology" originate and how did the catholic church in Latin America embrace?   Hmm... https://t.co/uBc3NZuTYq

@SarahPalinUSA Where did "liberation theology" originate?  Wonder if Tim Kaine is pulling some strings quietly in the background?  https://t.co/uBc3NZuTYq

@KirstenPowers Let's give a big hand to Sen. Feinstein who completely mishandled Dr. Ford's wishes to remain anonymous.  However, Feinstein complicity allows dozens of her peers to remain anonymous, having settled claims w/ taxpayer funds and victims sign NDA's.  #metoo https://t.co/wdik7ABeun
@LarryJGeist @thebradfordfile @SebGorka Somewhat...fact is he‚Äôs appointed more women to the Judiciary thus far and as many as Bill Clinton...have to overlook the snippet about Obama.  Pew research just pointing out facts.
@AndrewCMcCarthy @thehill Interesting that after all of the testimony affidavits FBI interviews, Dr. Ford &amp; legal team, refuse to move forward on reporting her assault to the local jurisdiction, Montgomery County in order to allow for a full criminal investigation.
@Barnes_Law BTW Jake - Reports are that Trump and Rosenstein simply discussed grandchildren and golf.  @jaketapper
@jaketapper Were you outraged about former POTUS taking flights on the Lolitta Express with convicted sexual predator Jeff Epstein?   Put a sock in it.  https://t.co/G0CeDCJV8q
@greggutfeld If Reiner's postion were true - Dems would be gerrymandering along.   Obama overreach 1,000 seats to flip to the GOP.  ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs almost a crime,‚Äù Democratic Party Vice Chair Donna Brazile says. ‚ÄúWe have been absolutely decimated at the state and local level.‚Äù  https://t.co/dydWZydw68
@TomFitton @gatewaypundit Higgins memo details what the POTUS and MAGA movements are up against.  Read, Share and Vote. 		 https://t.co/0GrPCOC6Da   		#turnbacktheleft  #MAGA
@LarryJGeist @thebradfordfile @SebGorka The point is - Trump has been extremely favorable to highly qualified judiciary nominees that are also women.    Something that gets lost in the narrative perpetuated by the Marxist that he's a sexist, etc., etc.
@SenBlumenthal U stand w your buddies in Congress!  Fraud!   #metoo.  https://t.co/wdik7ABeun
@SenBlumenthal Where‚Äôs your moral compass when it comes to your buddies in Cingress using taxpayer money to settle claims?  Feigning interest is not leadership!  #metoo.  https://t.co/wdik7ABeun
@marklevinshow Read the Higgins memo...awaken to the threat the POTUS and MAGA Movement are facing.   https://t.co/0GrPCOC6Da
@benshapiro They would have to equally rip on Franklin Delano Roosevelt...the New Deal icon.   Nominated Hugo Black (KKK) to SCOTUS, turned blind eye to Jim Crow southern Dems, and don‚Äôt forget Exec order 9066.   https://t.co/l5wgZeAb35
@rorycooper See media in the Higgins memo.  Simply playing their role in the political warfare against the POTUS and MAGA movements.   Must read.  #MAGA.  https://t.co/0GrPCOC6Da
@rorycooper Blindly pushing the cultural Marxist narrative to fundamentally TRANSFORM America.  Mainstream of Dems thought: Abolish the Electoral College, US Senate and Bill of Rights through judicial activism. https://t.co/D3kZA9YlHW
@thebradfordfile @SebGorka Trump doesn‚Äôt run around seeking kudos...more women judges than any prior Republican POTUS...on par w Bill Clinton.   Crickets from the MSM.    https://t.co/Dw2UGsn0pk
@RealJamesWoods Every time Gore opens his mouth, he releases hot air into the atmosphere...and a lot of it.
@OANN Not just some ‚Äúfar left‚Äù position. Mainstream of Dem leadership.   https://t.co/1aqUuPtQ9a
@thewayoftheid @ArielDumas How about shouting at their enablers who give speeches, join marches, speak at rallies.  They let their abusive peers roam the halls unscathed.  Warren Harris Feinstein Hirono Gillibrand all frauds #metoo https://t.co/wdik7ABeun
@ArielDumas What a fraud.  268+ settlements using taxpayer funds and hero worship of Warren Gillebrand Harris Etc., while they let abusers hide behind NDA‚Äôs their victims signed.  Pointing fingers and running for re-election #metoo #abusersincongress #throwthemout. https://t.co/wdik7ABeun
@JRubinBlogger UP:  Abusers in Congress belief they will escape scrutiny over using taxpayer money to settle claims.     https://t.co/wdik7ABeun
@KurtSchlichter @pspoole A dog chasing his tail.
