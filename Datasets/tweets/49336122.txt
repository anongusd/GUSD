In many ways, the bill continues to promote hardworking election officials and secretaries of state who tirelessly work to ensure every voice is heard in our elections. This bill supports the crucial work they do.
One of those nifty reforms: automatic voter registration, or AVR. It's gaining momentum and has netted bipartisan support in 15 states + DC. It increases registration while also promoting secure, accurate registration lists.

AND the state has to turn over information about all the provisional ballots. Sunlight is the best disinfectant.
@CommonCauseGA @PaulWeissLLP @myrna_perez_ A judge issued a temporary order requiring the state create an online portal and hotline so voters can check to see if their ballots were counted; to ensure a thorough review of those ballots; and to hold off on certifying results at least until Friday. https://t.co/6N0yJPr5Lv
@CommonCauseGA @PaulWeissLLP My colleague @myrna_perez_ argued in court that if there were a significantly higher number of provisional ballots cast, that could indicate that there are problems with the database and that the state needed to act to ensure those ballots weren't wrongly discounted.
@CommonCauseGA @PaulWeissLLP We said that if someone tampered with the database because of Kemp's publication of these vulnerabilities, that could jeopardize the status of valid provisional ballots.
@CommonCauseGA @PaulWeissLLP Here's why this matters. On the eve of election night, we filed suit against the SoS' office, saying that they recklessly publicized over and over a MAJOR vulnerability in the state's registration database.

But after CEU jumped through all the hoops required, Orban and his allies refused to sign a final bilateral deal. Earlier this month, the university's rector @M_Ignatieff announced CEU would effectively decamp to Vienna next fall. 8/X https://t.co/NJM8eE9mPj
My colleagues and friends at the university put up an incredible fight. My friends in the communications office in particularly helped galvanize a global movement to shield academic freedom and protect CEU. 7/X https://t.co/buNbNVxmuT
And then came revisions to the higher education law. In short, it put in place a series of onerous (but not insurmountable) barriers to foreign universities based in Hungary...basically only impacting the Soros-founded CEU. 6/X https://t.co/e1TRzrFFjr
But the heat didn't really come for CEU until 2017. That year, it was clear that the migrant inflows had fueled new animosity toward NGOs (particularly those receiving external funding from places like OSF). That led to an NGO registration law. 5/X https://t.co/ISlEHblMMM

If folks want better election systems and more accurate registration databases, might I suggest automatic voter registration, a system that updates information for eligible voters when they interact with a government agency like the DMV.
In short, it's a flawed solution in search of a non existent problem. https://t.co/4KX0kvM7Ti
Data show that something like one in ten eligible voters do not have government issued ID. That proportion only increases for people of color, low income Americans, the elderly, and the disabled.
So disregarding the president's Lucille Bluth-level gaffe on the ID requirements at Key Foods, let's not stray from facts. Election integrity is crucial, but overly burdensome ID laws just aren't the way to run our elections.

2) Cutbacks.		"While the backlog of immigration cases increased 283 percent over the past 10 years, the number of immigration judges increased just 54 percent." One immigration court judge described the system as ‚Äúdeath penalty cases heard in traffic court settings.‚Äù

@NewsHour Her last hope was a 2014 case about a woman from Guatemala. An immigration court said survivors of DV in her country were part of a specific social group facing discrimination.

These kinds of smears about "liberal establishment" ring hollow. Sentencing reform is a true bipartisan compromise. Not about hurting GOP. Goal is to end mass incarceration in America.

CONSOLIDATING. He's been considering it for a while.
It's also a way of ENERGIZING our politics. Participatory democracy is the name of the game. In Oregon, AVR led to a MUCH more representative electorate, boosting registration in rural areas, low-income areas...places where people are so often left behind by their leaders.
AVR has passed with bipartisan (and in Vermont, TRIpartisan) support across the country. In Illinois, it received a unanimous vote from the legislature and was signed by a GOP governor. It's downright good government at a time when so many are disillusioned with politics.
"Very few government reforms of this magnitude require such a light lift." New Jersey is on the brink of passing automatic voter registration, a cost-effective way to make our elections more accurate, more secure, and more democratic. https://t.co/3q3x0xX5Ad
