Why aren't the Liberals challenging President Trump in court like they have in the past on other issues?  Perhaps it's because  the President is following the law and they can't do anything about it.  The law is the Flores Consent Decree from 1997.
@FoxNews Why weren't they doing this during the Obama presidency?  It was worse then.
@charliekirk11 Good luck!

President Trump has done more for the USA in 500 days than all the inept administrations in the last 30 years.  He represents true Americans not fools on the Left.

Do you know why President Trump is smirking at the Euro leaders &amp; Canada at the G7 summit? Did you notice that the Asian leaders are behind the President? Because we will be trading aluminum, steel, crops &amp; dairy with North Korea. Canada and Europe can trade with Iran.
