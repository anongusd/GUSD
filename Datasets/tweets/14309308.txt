@AlandraGJohnson Looks like she’s proofreading 🤓
@WheelerCFB @Carla_Pereira2 @ryanstrang Digital ads are easier to track. I have always had a system in place where we track where people learned of it from (q on app, secy asks on phone call). It’s considered a lead no matter the medium. The conversion doesn’t happen w/out the personal and face-to-face process though.
@WheelerCFB @Carla_Pereira2 @ryanstrang It’s not as expensive as you might think with the right strategy. Inexpensive cannot replace effective. I get what you are saying and think it’s great it works for you, I just wanted to share that I don’t think anyone should feel badly about buying a billboard or a newspaper ad.
@WheelerCFB @Carla_Pereira2 @ryanstrang Yes, it takes a mix of marketing tactics—both digital and traditional—to make it all work. Glad it’s working for you. Here in Ohio we still do a mix of billboards, radio ads, newspaper ads, lots of direct mail and digital media...depending on the goal. It all has a purpose still.
@WheelerCFB @ryanstrang Can you tie the actual enrollment to the digital ad? I would think the parents would want to tour, meet people and come for a visit before enrolling. Digital ads can definitely drive applications/inquiries but the personal, the follow-up close the deal.
@WheelerCFB @ryanstrang They serve different purposes &amp; depend on what the return is you’re measuring. In the recruitment of new students over my career there have been 2 tactics that work more than any others: direct mail &amp; face-to-face. No FB ad has ever enrolled a new student in my experience.

A6: Provide training and have expectations. It’s really that simple.  #K12prchat
@TheEmilyB Thanks. It’s fun to look back on now bc we gave them flip cams and digital cameras to document everything. That was before iPhones and smart phones 🤣 There were about 5-6 other Ohio schools that modeled similar campaigns after it proved successful.
A5: Back in 2009 when there were hardly any schools using social media we did the bold thing of launching Hi-Point Journeys creating a team of student bloggers to document their entire school year. It was a hit at that time and last several years after! #K12PRChat https://t.co/WH1yV0fk1w

@BBDaneDell Exactly. It's a little bit sad to see a public meltdown but also a little interesting. You'd think the leader of the free world would have more important things to do than watching CNN (which he allegedly hates) for an interview with Lebron.
Is it interesting or is it sad to watch a man whose crimes and lies are beginning to close in on him meltdown in a public space? https://t.co/lK0JIZiu36

@kmagette @bsnicol2 @JoshuaTSauer @JulieThannum @Phxflyer @andreagribble @DanielCThigpen @lesleybruinton @tjentz @ericajchandler I think the ability to have fun starts from the freedom you and your colleagues have to be creative and strategic and autonomous. The ability to stretch and grow and fail and try new things yields an environment where you are free from fear.
@kmagette @bsnicol2 @JoshuaTSauer @JulieThannum @Phxflyer @andreagribble @DanielCThigpen @lesleybruinton @tjentz @ericajchandler A passion for the work, guided towards the mission in real, tangible terms (not just being there to collect a check and a pension and thus not being willing to change or push because of those safety nets). And of course, the ability to have fun.

@kmagette For me this is a case-by-case decision. I don't think there is a blanket answer here. What do you think? #K12PRChat
@DetroitPRComm I always found it helpful to do a campaign with theme each year to give us one focus (this all stayed within brand). It helps limit the types of stories that make the cut.
A7: Stand for Values. Own your position. Stay the course. The rest is noise. #k12prchat https://t.co/srk8f7bazd
@Dearing22 This is awesome, btw! #K12PRChat
@JeremyDBond Thanks. These events were fun to do. And effective. #K12PRChat
A6: There are too many stories to tell (or at least to do it in a way we creatives think is effective). I like to focus on the stories that tie into the overall strategy/plan. You simply can't be pulled all over the place, IMO. #k12prchat

So before we once again let our politicians off the hook and cowardly put off action &amp; we as a society callously move on to the next news cycle, this is what I’ve learned from 19 years of mass shootings...
I was in my 1st yr of teaching when Columbine happened. It was shocking &amp; sickening but I would have never imagined that 19 yrs would go by &amp; we as a society would have allowed so many people (esp. children) to die and suffer through more mass shootings.

@IAmAmeerah Yes. Marketing does cost money. Effective marketing, anyhow. #K12PRChat
@kmagette @BBDaneDell I saw Milli Vanilli in concert in like 1989. They looked like they were really singing.
A1: Because marketing by definition involves contributing to the company’s bottom line, schools often shun the practice for any number of reasons. That has shifted because of competition, but a giant barrier is just getting past the aversion to marketing. #K12PRChat

@sabreangel @thesteveking @Carla_Pereira2 Each orgs experience is different. I think we want to be careful to paint with a broad brush brush based on a few articles, conversations with a handful of people or our own personal preferences.
@sabreangel @thesteveking @Carla_Pereira2 I have to disagree with everyone on this thread. When using Snap strategically and sparingly at Tolles, our stories were watched at twice the rate they were on Insta and our geofilters were consumed at strong levels.

@kmagette @delainanicole We also have a fully licensed preschool our Early Childhood Ed program operates so we have little kids, too. 👩‍🏫
A tip of the White Hat &amp; singing the praises of @kmagette &amp; @Phxflyer for their effort on tonight's #k12prchat | follow the hat @ROAD2NSPRA https://t.co/ao8dPPvpXr
@delainanicole It's my favorite thing. I have access to ducks, dogs, cats, ferrets, lizards, snakes, birds, doves, etc. etc. etc. #k12prchat
A6: I find animals in our animal-based #careerteched programs when I need a pick-me-up (and then we do photo shoots) #K12PRChat https://t.co/nQF78U7gH8
@Phxflyer I'll get that framed for you! #k12prchat
A5: As simple as this. https://t.co/Q9lak84u3U
@kmagette Laffy taffy or hot tamales will do the trick. Swedish fish, etc.
This. If they question use of humour (my Canada homage for the evening), show them how much greater the engagement is with humour #k12prchat https://t.co/R96p60bSFc
@kmagette Well, that looks pretty comfortable what that dog is doing, so... #k12prchat
A4: I don't. (Unless they have a natural personality for it). I'd rather they just play it straight or let me help them. 😏 #k12prchat
@Phxflyer I just want to write funny captions on Instagram all day. #k12prchat
A3: Stressful day at work. I see the Animal Mgmt cat chill af in their lab and post this on our Insta. Made me laugh 🤷🏼‍♂️🤷🏼‍♂️ #K12PRchat https://t.co/m4CpCQTM4Z
@KarenGeddeis You can never go wrong using a mascot. They are inherently funny in human situations. 😂 #k12prchat
A2: Tone is so vital. Timing= not overdoing it.  #k12prchat
@WheelerCFB That's exactly it. I laugh at it and sometimes that's all that matters. ;) #k12prchat
@JessStilger They are so funny on Twitter on snow days. Pretty clever. #k12prchat
A1: GIFs on Twitter, irreverant and weird on Snapchat, meme-like or relevant snark captions on Instagram works for us #k12prchat
A1: Humor is so important for our #careerteched teen audience, but it can only be done every so often &amp; carefully...  #k12prchat
My first GIF didn't work, but it still makes me laugh. #k12prchat https://t.co/YIIBf2IlQ2
