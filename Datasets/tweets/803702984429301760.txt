@ArnoldbjohnsonB @AriFleischer Good point.   You might want to work toward getting the oligarchs out of leadership so we can respond to the Russian aggressions on all fronts
@AriFleischer Ari, short of blowing up the capital while cuddling with Putin and wiping his butt with the flag,  what would Trump need to do to justify impeachment.  And if the Pres. were a Dem. is wearing aTan suit still enough for you?
@marklevinshow What were the legislative purposes when John Dean testified and the rest of Nixon's entourage.
@EroticPTWinters @BettieSpaghety @Melissa94432101 @Jim_Jordan @ddale8 According to the Washington post	https://t.co/tIkwMzbneR
#Trump #CohenHearing Stacey Plaskett (D-VI)		U.S.C 1512 referral of Matt Gates.		Responding to prior inquiry: lays Dem priorities and points out that Democrats can walk and chew gum.  More time wasting		Cxm retainer agreement.		Rona Graff able to corroborate Trumps actions.
#Trump" #CohenHearing  It would appear that Cohen has walked back his testimony on presenting recordings of clients.		Rep Chip Roy, is doing a news cast about the border.   Now he's recounting his conversation with his wife.  Although interesting not very helpful.
Rep Steube should have listened to the other Republican Reps who spoke before him, as well as the GOP Reps in the last congress who failed in oversight.		If he had done that, he would not be wasting the committee and our time, now.
Kelly Armstrong (R-ND) made some good points on the issue of Cohen's choice to turn over client tape recordings to the committee.		I'm hopeful (for his non-Trump client's sake) that Cohen, restates his position on that one.   But it was a good catch by Armstrong.

@davidfrum He can cash the check from Mexico and pay for the wall.		Trump industries can contract with workers to have the wall built, and then he can bankrupt out of it, like he had 6 times before.  And not pay the workers. 		Or he can move on with governing.

@realDonaldTrump That's petty
@thomasfagan19 @mitchellvii Because voters cast their ballot for their choice for political office who happened to be Democrats.		Your unhappiness with that vote, does not in any way determine whether the vote was legal. 		It's lame to imply a vote counter to your candidate is not lawful.
@mitchellvii Stole implies mailed CA absentee votes are unlawful.  They're not. 		Your characterizing lawful votes as "stole a win", is right-wing extremist propaganda from your big microphone.  Shame on you!		Try to understand Federalism before posting drivel.  Your ravings are not helpful.
@JacobAWohl Not true.  The worker who receives insurance as part of compensation is not paying higher insurance prices.  The Company who has 1000, 5000, 10000 in a pool is not paying higher insurance prices.		The individual with no collective power is subsidizing / paying higher power.

@convoice @JackPosobiec I'm not worried about Ginsberg.  She is an undead/Zombie hybrid. 		The only reason  you and other Republicans still exist is because you are not a source of food as some other zombie (McConnel? Trump?) has eaten your brain.		Unfortunately, we still our subjected to your drivel.
@convoice @JackPosobiec Hearsay is an out of court statement offered for the truth of the matter asserted. It has about 21 exceptions.  One of which is applicable and was listed. 		I'm not responsible for your lack of knowledge.  Read a 1L evidence Horne book.  Don't be lazy and stupid.
@FoxNews @senatemajldr @IngrahamAngle There is no need for a bail system if people are presumed innocent.

@convoice @JackPosobiec Trump beseeching the Russians to search Hillary's email,  after his kids meet with Russians and then lied about it.  What does Putin have on him?  Where is the Constitutional oversight from Gowdy et. al   Sellouts  all of you.
@convoice @JackPosobiec Kavanaugh's drunken mumbles would be statements against interest and would be exceptions.  		Learn something!  it's clear you know nothing about law.		Like your scummy fellow Republicans, you are making sh*t up.  But you did it to get a SCOTUS seat, so that makes it OK
@convoice @JackPosobiec How do you figure it's hearsay?  Most of them  are describing the things they know of their own personal knowledge.  It's therefore not hearsay.  Calling you foul names is undignified, but your fake legal knowledge just begs for it.
@convoice @JackPosobiec If they're not liars, they just haven't told anyone the facts they saw 30 years ago.   Burr we'll never know because the administration never talked to them.  But it's OK to cheat and lie, Because Kavanaugh is RepuliKKKan
@convoice @JackPosobiec Your Mind Is Made Up in a way that supports your narrative. More than 40 people had publicly indicated they had information for the FBI; 9 were questioned.

@Silentbrew @THEblindhomer @JackPosobiec I watched about 11 hours of testimony and argument with only 2 fact witnesses.  I want to hear from ALL the others and make an informed decision (not a partisan one).		When you delay Garland 10 months, spend a few days and do it right, or you can cut it short for partisan gain.
@robertdorazi @JackPosobiec Declare victory and leave the field of battle. 		It's a good strategy for you in this situation.  Maybe you'll see it reported on Fox.  🤣		*fade as Black King falls over in slow motion and rolls off Chess board.

@robertdorazi @JackPosobiec Your conspiracy theories although entertaining and fictional are... (it's just too easy)  		Face it you're not interested in putting in the time and effort to find facts - if they exist.  For Garland you could delay 10 months.  		1/2
@OwlenRose @JackPosobiec When did the OK bombing occur?  Oh yeah decades ago.   If the facts were decades old,  are you so naive as to think all those cold facts would be at the ready. 		If so, I got a wall for you and,  Mexico is going to pay for it.
@convoice @JackPosobiec Hang on... When was the vote on Merrick Garland scheduled?  Wait it never was.  10 month delay. 		And you don't have a week or so to do a thorough investigations.   You all should listen to Lindsey Graham's narrative and apply it to yourselves.		But that would be inconvenient.
@robertdorazi @JackPosobiec Maybe one that tries to determine if it did happen.  Or if other reported incidents happened.  Or if any of the other purported corroborating witnesses actually have something to corroborate. 		If the answer is "yes" great.  If not great.  But actually do the work.
@JackPosobiec Criticizing a partial investigation is not criticizing the FBI. It is criticizing those who ordered the investigation be limited. 		You knew that.  It is inconvenient to your narrative.  But you knew it.		Did you get 30 pieces of silver,  Judas?
@BillOReilly Listening to the testimony? Weighing it? The prior inconsistencues of the witnesses. 		You knew that.  You just wanted a soapbox.
We had an opportunity to get all the information about Kavanaugh.  Witnesses report they have not been interviewed.  We have the time!		We lack the backbone
@pbump Par for the course.
@LindseyGrahamSC Or Sen.  you could publicly go into a historic histrionic meltdown and add gas to the fire rather than show a modicum of leadership.		Thanks for nothing.  For 2 years I'll be reliving your spineless outbreak when I see the adverts from challengers for your seat. 		That's pathetic
@LindseyGrahamSC If you weren't so blindly partisan,  YOU would acknowledge that the Garland fiasco,  coupled with a President who has ignored the cold war, plays footsies with Putin, and doesn't tell the truth,  supported by enablers like yourself made this mess.  We then could start to fix it.

Trump had a ghastly performance with his maker and had has yet to pay for his untruths, but it sure looked like they had a little cuddle while Trump got his next orders. Don't you wonder what he got for selling us out?
@thormountain @marklevinshow I have no idea how much evidence Mueller has and neither do you.  And your thought that he's waiting to release it dramatically shows your unfamiliarity with USAM and the policies of prosecution relative to political events.
@RichLowry Sometimes the fellow representing a client still tries to minimize the damage from the client's imminent collision with the brick wall even though the client is stepping on the gas and locking the steering wheel.		It is then when an advocates history and credibility carry the day
2/2Then the equivalent of the ecclesiastical court can solicit G*d,if he exists, for forgiveness and absolution.		Catholic Priests Bishops,  Arch-bishops, Cardinals, and Popes must be held accountable in the courts
A priesthood with sinners is foreseeable.  Catholic management covering up these acts/sins is not governmentally forgivable absent criminal legal process after criminal penalties (jail). 		1/2 https://t.co/76HdMuEalA
@thormountain @marklevinshow The difference being Bill was impeached and disbarred for lying. (But Not convicted ). You appear to be part of the Republikkkan wing of the GOP, so the evidence, if it exists, won't matter.		3K+ lies leaves lots of people concerned for the Union.  Time to hunt us some witches.
@thormountain @marklevinshow Unless you're the Pres.... Or Unless you're part of the Mueller team you don't know what evidence there is of collusion.  		We do know that a former National Security Advisor,  one of the president's best, plead guilty to lying to investigators about talking with the Russians.
@thormountain @marklevinshow "abuse of power" DNE illegal.  Illegal is found after a determination of guilt by a trier of fact.   You should know this.		It MAY not have been illegal to P*ssy Grab. It was an abuse of power especially where one has financial and/or org. chart resources in excess of the grabee.

@thormountain @marklevinshow Your mom's fine.  Your picture is suspect.  Thor carries a hammer and is a God. Holger uses a short sword, and was human. Holger represents a country.  		Try to take that into consideration.  A smart boy like you should know that.
@mitchellvii You had a follow-back advertisement a week ago.  You don't now.		Is your memory as week as your sophistry?
@thormountain @marklevinshow So Thor... If you weren't so ignorant, your education argument might be persuasive.

@DineshDSouza Are you really that out of touch.   You're a sycophant to the leader of the invertebrates that is the Republicans. Trump could cut out your vocal chords at a CPAC convention and no one in the GOP would care.		Voters are gonna get us some witches in November, though.

@mschlapp You confuse being a mercenary with a president. The French Foreign Legion will fight like heck against anyone who Mulcrone tells them too.		But the policy should be independent. Putin and Trump's love affair makes Trump the head Mercenary in service of a racist, antiwoman gov.

Trump's sensitive about Omarosa , Manafort,his Lawyer, Mueller,  giving aid and comfort to  Russia. Charotteville		What do they have on the Pres? Why are there 500 kids separated from parents. Why does N.K. have nukes? 		The invertebrate right lost its way.
@marklevinshow Gee Mark.  What are you? a professional bowler?   Are you too compromised to conclude having your own show makes you part of the press!  		Other parts of the press are focusing on the corrupt intent of the Pres. In revoking Sec. Clearances to distract from racist 45, and manafort

@GeraldoRivera @realDonaldTrump We think it unseemly that Trump expects to use Air Force One  for his flying love shack for "cuddles" with  Putin, Ping Duterte etc, after blowing up alliances with durations of 100s of years that prevailed over communist, totalitarianists, and despots all for the Trump brand.
@GovMikeHuckabee @POTUS Manafort in jail,  Flynn convicted, Popodopolous convicted, 100s of indictments.  Solicitation of Russians to find e-mails, emoluments, no tax returns, 3000 lies, apologists  like you,  tax cuts for wealthy,  budget busting,  general irresponsibility, in first 2 years.
@AriFleischer Ari that was pre-Trump, the RepubliKKKan wing of the GOP, his megalomania, the loss of the spine of the Republican wing of the GOP, 3000 lies,  Little Marco, and crooked Hillary, Manafort in jail, you became an apologist for a racist, charlottesville,  "Grab 'em by the pus

@AndrewCMcCarthy Their are also 144 million people subject to arrest because of the warrant when they travel internationally -Assumes travel is to a country w extradition.		If  success of conviction is low we should stop the investigation?  You  would say the same if a family member were murdered
@DorAnnCecil @DineshDSouza @realDonaldTrump Omitting the Emoluments, conspiracy, nepotism, security, national interest, breach of duty, cases and that his campaign manager being jailed for witness tampering, Trump still has a lot of exposure and will probably end up taking it for his team Captain Vladimer Putin
@JacobAWohl Call me a skeptic, but I don't think you know Vlad well enough to have first hand knowledge about this.  Wait, maybe you do?   The FBI should investigate.  		Does he float or sink when thrown in water.

@DineshDSouza @Debber66 Still a felon...   A felon who has been pardoned.   There was no certificate of factual innocence that is any public record of which I am aware.   Please advise
@DineshDSouza @realDonaldTrump If there is no crime, there is nothing to pardon.  So whether you understood it or not you admitted guilt when you accepted the pardon.  If you had been let out of prison but no pardon, that it a commutation. 		I think the term in Burdick is "confession of guilt"

@JohnDTrudel @JacobAWohl Hot tip.  Prosecutors are "biased" against law breakers.  Prosecuting Investigators are biased against the accused.   Defense attorneys are biased for the accused.  The Trier of facts makes the call on the weight of the evidence.  It is the way the system works.

@realDonaldTrump American prosecutors:  Don't break the law and the investigation won't be a problem.  I'd you did break the law,  it might be a problem
@realDonaldTrump Stop playing the victim.   You did not do your due diligence.  You hired an accused lawbreaker and may have conspired with him to break the law.		Regardless of his acts you did not have to conspire.   Just say no!
@realDonaldTrump He shouldn't break the law.
@realDonaldTrump All though it may impossible for this pres.  People can have their own beliefs and still follow the law.  		Prosecutors are supposed to investigate law breaking.  They're probably not on your Christmas card list.   It doesn't mean they're conflicted

@JacobAWohl You are a co-conspirator in #Liegate.		Care to comment on why the house oversight committee's report was done before the subpoena's and investigation was completed on Bannon and the other people subject to oversight.		House oversight protected Trump at the expense of country.

@chuckwoolery It's called delegating authority when ethically compromised or when you have a conflict of interest. 		Rule of law has been forgotten by many in the Republikkkan wing of the GOP.  The unaffiliated, Dems, and rest of GOP think its important.		You lost your moral compass. Find it.
@SetsukoGermana1 @mitchellvii The Trumpistas conveniently forget they got the best Gov that money can rent with the corporate welfare and the trillions to the rich and connected.		But the voters are not blind.   We'll see what The voters say in Nov.
@mitchellvii So disapointing when purported influencers forget that votes are what elect people.  Not dollars.		Although the Pres. and Gop gave treats to the rich and connected with the tax bill, the Tuesday of reckoning in November is quickly approaching. 		 Its later than you think.

@katinthemagahat @mitchellvii "There is no evidence" is what the accused says while walking over the Corpse on the floor.

@mitchellvii It would be impossible for Bill to know millions of people.  		His is a misguided statement, and the fact he made it shows the depth of his ignorance.
@politico That's a bad look for Trump.   What if the citizenry decides Presidents that are inept and buffoons should be put out of the Country?		It will save him from having to fly airforce 1 outside of the country for his surrender at a Russian consulate.  Bonus!
@mitchellvii What I like about Bill is just because his buddy Trump won't allow him to have any independent thoughts,  he assumes that all are mesmerized like him.  		Free and independent thought is impossible for him to conceptualize. 		Pretty funny in that inane but doesn't realize it way.
@Mrfward @Debdicker @JackPosobiec Except for a guilty plea by assistant to campaign manager.  Nsa guilty plea, papodopolous plea and slew of indictments.  Pres.

@jimmybuffett @SXM_Help @SIRIUSXM Have you or any of your followers found a way to find the schedule for your channel.  I'm sure there is a workaround, but it is pretty elusive.  I'd like to know when a certain show is on certain channel?
@brodie__g have you found a way to search for the schedule of programs on a specific channel.
@AdamSchein @SIRIUSXM @AdamSchein it's flashy.  @SXM_Help has been unable to point me to a way to find the schedule for a channel.  Do you know of any way?

@JaredRizzi Murderers, rapists, thugs, and white collar criminals have it in common that they would like to stop investigations that threaten them.  		These alleged Kleptocrats, malfeasors and colluders are not unique in their desire to avoid the air and light that is Mueller's disinfectant
@JosephMarionRa2 @mitchellvii She may be a whore.

@Zeus556 @2021_free @realDonaldTrump @MSNBC Paradise for you is an increase of $8000. 00 per man woman and child since December for a $400.00 / family per year tax cut and Trillions for the rich.

@realDonaldTrump Another addition to your thousand of untruths. If only you spent half the effort on doing a good job as you do telling us your doing a good job.
Good point https://t.co/O6LtfZLRM3
@realDonaldTrump Your tax cuts and appropriations bills made each man, woman, and child pay  about $8000.00 more in national debt  before interest for on average $400.00 / year per family. You and your crowd got Trillions in tax cuts.  		You are responsible for 1 more bankruptcy - the U.S.

@Chrissygreen12 @AriFleischer Going back to the original point I made...  It is standard procedure to allow people to wait for each other inside and away from each other.   The alternative is that everyone has to arrive at the EXACT same time.   Never happens.  This was an empowered Jr. Manager on steroids.
@Chrissygreen12 @AriFleischer I don't know what restaurant you work at, but at most of the ones that I go too, they will not seat an incomplete party.  Which makes sense to me, because most parties want to eat at the same time.  So they order at the same time, which doesn't occur 'til they are all there.
@CryptoGlamDoll @EdwardGLuce Roseanne, the show, is about a poor white family that's barely making it economically, with a gender fluid 11 year old who has a Lesbian mom (we think) and a mixed race Grand child.  		It is not the Republikkkan wing of the party.  It's still good entertainment. Try it!

@bc4488 @JudicialWatch @JeffSessions17 The public is not entitled to see expenditures that would compromise the investigation.  Out of what dark corner of your apparently active imagination do you dream this stuff up from.  Remember Country over party over president.  Flynn, Gates, Popodopolous, flipped.
@MarieA4USA @JudicialWatch @PamLane44412792 He came out of retirement at your governments request to do this.  Reading this thread is enlightening. All of you seen more interested in protecting the president than assuring fair elections in your Country.  I'm Not buying it Comrade!  Sounds like Troll spew.
@dogpoopelosi1 @JudicialWatch Have you ever heard Gohmert have an original thought before?  He's  reading talking points of the co conspirators.  He'sthe embodiment of party before Country.  Do you think Judicial Watch is interested in the whole truth or just Trump Truth.  You only interested in Trump Truth?
@MyInfo57945683 @JudicialWatch You have no idea what info was given to the judge to support the warrant.  Plus it's a high profile case.  And if you do know what the judge received you should be in jail or on the New York AG's team. If the latter you have broken the oath and be in jail
@MonaPierre @JudicialWatch Not while the investigation is ongoing.  It could very easily tip off suspects and compromised witnesses.  		Put party over Country much.  Come on use your head MC Fly.  Is there anything in there?
@JudicialWatch You will have to wait until receiving the docs does risk showing the the direction of the investigation
@TaxReformExpert No Dems think it stupid to have an average tax benefit of $400.00. When the cbo is saying the tax bill adds about 1.7T to the debt and the appropriationsvbill added 1.5T. Which is about $9800.00 per every man woman and child. So $400.00 per family or 9.5k per person in debt.
@BenHardee @jlc7212007 @ADmomof3 @AriFleischer Maybe, depends on the circumstances.  It is much more gray than you think.  The police have qualified immunity.   If enforcing the law you refuse them, they can use force.  So resisting arrest gets added to the charges.   You plea bargain down to no jail time and pay Atty fees.
@justwongirl @jlc7212007 @AriFleischer If someone nicely comes in your door, and nicely wipes there feet on the mat, so your carpet doesn't get dirty.   When they sit in your front and nicely readtheir cell phone.   		They are still a trespasser. When you ask them to leave and don't, you and the police can eject them
@jonallendc @DavidJollyFL You don't believe that he wants to spend more time with his family.  		We have not heard if this is a reciprocal desire, but...

@AriFleischer When Do they become a guest, when they enter? Not according to Starbucks. If someone comes in your front door, they may be an invitee or a trespasser.  It depends on the circumstances. 		As a public figure,  you do a disservice by opining absent facts or knowledge of the law.
@BenHardee @jlc7212007 @ADmomof3 @AriFleischer And you too will see what color the holding cell is painted.
@jesseshuck @rcjparry @AriFleischer Therein is the problem.  Does THIS Starbucks make it a habit to make all partial parties wait outside in the weather until all are here before they can enter the premises to complete the transaction.  I doubt it.
@jesseshuck @wd5jwy @AriFleischer When I did,  I, like you, risked arrest.  More importantly, is waiting for another to complete a buy sell transaction loitering.
@jlc7212007 @AriFleischer Starbucks was in the wrong if this was racially motivated.   You,  I, and Starbucks have the right to quiet enjoyment of private property.   		If someone  comes to your office, home or front yard and stays after asked to leave, they are trespassers.  Cops must eject if called.
@Chrissygreen12 @AriFleischer So either you wait out in the weather our arrive at EXACTLY the same time.  Most restaurants will not seat incomplete parties.   (Not completely on point)
@AriFleischer Bad result, but legal unless racially motivated.  Someone comes to your private property.  You ask them to leave.   They don't.  Trespasser. The police are called, and they eject them.  		Starbucks is private property like your front yard, office, or church. 		Pretense ask? Race?
@AriFleischer The point you're missing is that you as a white guy could park your self and your stuff at Starbucks and wait for a friend.  		The guy with the black skin couldn't.   And for him it's not an isolated incident.  It's a regular part of his life.  You are just seeing for 1st time
@theresa2u2 @blu03boy @ShellyJojola @tedlieu @1WarMachine2018 @realDonaldTrump Really, to use a catholic measuring stick... Mortal sin is killing someone.  Venial sin is hurting someone.

@ShellyJojola @theresa2u2 @tedlieu @1WarMachine2018 @realDonaldTrump Yours is a sick sad world.   Mueller's investigation has been more water tight than a ducks butt.

Or you can save a few bucks and talk to the DA without counsel. I hope you like orange jumpsuits.
@SCClemons @realDonaldTrump We are contributors to or are conspirators in some of the best kakistocracies in history; ours and those we try to help and then abandon.  		Nature and politics abhor a vacuum.		Nobody does Kakistocracy better than Cadet Bonespurs and General Vlad.  		I'm tired of winning!
@glassceiling02 @shannonrwatts @TonyRobbins But they are afraid of their lawyer and an angry jury.  The pendulum has swung and bashed a hole in male entitlement, so now being accused is being convicted.   Assume no grope or wrongdoing, you can still get sued, and even if you win you're out 100s of K in Attorney fees.
@sharon_leff @shannonrwatts @TonyRobbins Agreed, but if you're a biz owner who does not grope or sexually assault, but are mindful of the current environment where an accusation is a conviction, is it rational to risk a law suit or loss of your business on getting the hire wrong?  This is not a small risk... bankruptcy.
@Beegeebers @shannonrwatts @TonyRobbins Not PC but honest...  You've worked decades to build a business.  You don't grope, grab or sexually assault.  Right now an accusation is a conviction.  Do you risk your life's work.  Or do you minimize risk and avoid a female hire?  It's a horrible situation and unfair to M &amp; W.
@JoiseyJoh @shannonrwatts @TonyRobbins Intimidation aside.  Considering how the pendulum has swung and bashed a hole in the wall of male entitlement, but also let in organizational bias that protects women and  assumes men are scum...  		How would you counsel a man in management?  Business is risk averse? Why risk it?
@JudicialWatch JW confuses the investigation and investigators with the trier of fact or trial.  AG's and DA's have a bias against breaking the law they are supposed to.  It or ridiculous to think of a DA being ambivalent on the breaking of the law or the law breaker
@davmarshall2005 @D_man1974 @sharraj @Mediaite The FBI investigates, The AG files charges.  So it's not important what the investigator thinks or their party affiliation, the AG sorts that out.		Kenneth starr was on record of dispising Clinton, that's the way investigators are. 	 Finders of fact and law with the evidence.
@D_man1974 @Mediaite Um... Let's see.  The law in the last law office I was in was thirty two linear feet in book cases 6 feet tall and that did not include the U.S. code or federal regs.  		You might have violated one or two of the directives and not even known about it?

@realDonaldTrump If you would get rid of the flying monkeys in your cabinet, people would lower their pitchforks.  Stay away from fire and little girls with buckets of water.  You risk melting and/or messing up your hair. OhWheeOh.  OhWheeOh.   Or are you scare crow to Putin's Oz @MichaelSteele
@DeadlineWH @MichaelSteele @NicolleDWallace Republicans v. Republikkkans.  The naive among us thought the Republikkkans has been vanquished by the civil rights movement.  Shame on CPAC for giving voice to Republikkkans. We are well served by those who have the courage to carry a flag against this divisive trend.

@MichaelSteele 	John Hopkins and George town... Props!  💪🗣		The Cpac statement about you... wrong!  		Matt Schlapp statement 💩		My favorite Republican.  (Not a Republikkkan) You would be embraced with a (D) behind your name.  Sadly no.		Keep the faith!  Well get through this!
@AriFleischer Ari, are you willing to put your reputation on the line that Russia only spent 46K on the election.  Remember they probably spent that much on airfare getting to Clandestine meetings with the Trumps.  Keep what little dignity you still have and reconsider
@bwsttn @AriFleischer Well your half right.  We won't hear about it.  It won't be successful.  He'll pick another fight with a player who kneels during National anthem. It will give him cover to destroy more of the USA.
@ValGiwa @AriFleischer The dossier was started the Beacon a newspaper for the right.  2 +2=4 regardless of who says it. Have you read it.  And what parts have been proven false. And even removing tinged parts , with your lying president, it's still bad. Read many sources not just fox.
@DebbieSchooley3 @AriFleischer D. How do you KNOW the charges are bogus. They aren't bogus just cause you want them to be. Every Intelligence agency has acknowledged the meddling.  Cadet BoneSpurs and his sycophants say no. He lies you swear to it.  Put down the Kool-aid.
@chapronrin @jane_anderson @FLDailyPost @AriFleischer Not when an election is thrown because of Russian meddling.  There's no proof of what the accused says while walking over the Corpse. His indolence is as shameful as your defense of no sanctions and his divisive policy and rhetoric.  While your at it buy an AR15 for a psychotic.
@cherrammy @AriFleischer @POTUS He'll do what needs to be done to fatten his wallet ala the Tromp hotels, and Mar A Lago where his security detail is 4X the cost of Obama's in the same period.  He'll do what he needs to get in 18 holes rather than do the Gov. Work.  His idleness and distractibility waste $.
@miller197 @AriFleischer @POTUS he's putting legacy and wind blown policy over good government and fiscal responsibility.  Adding 3 trillion to debt approximately 12k per person since his inauguration.  Build a wall Millennial will tear it down.  Mexicans will go over, under, and around til they do. Waste of $
@AriFleischer Republic before Republican revel in it.  It looks good on you. I hope this new turn has some staying power.  The other direction of off-putting and unseemly
@realDonaldTrump You made speeches and gave press conference in 2000 and 2012.  Look on C-SPAN.  It will help you remember
@realDonaldTrump You have no way of verifying your statement. It cannot be proven or disproven.  But you lie so much you do not get the benefit of the doubt.
@DougHeye I can help you out with that.  Reply with Bank name, Acct Number and Password.  Don't forget to include Mother's maiden name and the answer to your secret question  (Remember it's case sensitive.)

@JackPosobiec Hillary is not president.  The matter was investigated.  You are a troll
@jbillinson @TomiLahren Apparently, that is what passes for commentary on Fox News.
@suevig @GovMikeHuckabee No, but were sure you're a troll and a disgrace to humanity.   It could have been saliva.
@GovMikeHuckabee Cheap shot! You're a worse troll, than you are an example for our Children.   I use to believe that the clergy had some dignity.  Your tweets and anti-social acts show that the Clergy are  political opportunists who are now hiding in the swamp.  Your moral credibility is 0.
@GovMikeHuckabee @TGowdySC @realDonaldTrump I disagree regarding fair.  I note the diligence that he attacked the oversight when there was a Democratic administration.   Compare that with his indolence during the Current administration.  Disgraceful.  He is first a partisan.  He is not fair.
@politico He was fierce when the Democrats were in his cross hairs.  His voice has been unheard since.   He appears to have put party over country.

@chrislhayes Agreed.  We live in interesting times.   Possibly Pathologically interesting times.
@JacobAWohl Shill!  You have not read the memo.  The minority states that the supporting documents when fully presented leads to a different conclusion.    Just like the kerfuffle resulting in the transcript being released.   Shameful.  Don't risk the country for your party. https://t.co/jMNw4K1kuU

@MDMA_Australia @Blueweekend42 Such a troll response.  Can you imagine  that some folks don't live in areas where being gay is OK.  This person may be doing an anonymous inquiry so that he doesn't risk the marginalization that comes from being gay in some places.  I'm straight.  Your response is mean.

If you do, your just a sanctimonious troll responding to someone who has a different life experience. That's ignorance .
@Blueweekend42 I had a gay teacher 1975-79.  Parents warned my Mom, "He's gay".  Mom asked "Will he learn?" "Yes!" He was funny, weird and a great teacher   I didn't realize he was flaming 'til 1990 when I became a little more worldly. Don't worry.  I'm straight.  RIP George Burdick - teacher.

@thehill Release the supporting data also. A ghost written Trey Gowdy character assassination, is just political chicanery absent supporting documents.  Fox will say it's the modern gospel. MSNBC will say it's fishwrap. We need supporting Docs to make our own decision

@thehill Release the memo along with the supporting data so the citizenry can get an understanding of the memo in context， not just as a tool four political chicanery.

@KBrocking Thank you for your honesty.   But that still makes you a troll
@KBrocking If you don't see the difference between those statements, you need new eyes to bat.  One is  about an entire "out group"/ country /continent made by Potus while in his Representative capacity.  The other a candidate / past candidate in/about a group that included her.  Context!
@MichaelCohen212 @MichaelWolffNYC @POTUS @nikkihaley As I said before, if the man himself denied it, would you believe him?  Especially with 2000+ lies to his name since inauguration?

@chuckwoolery No.  You are acting like a troll
@GovMikeHuckabee Oversimplify much?  You forgot the looking the other way / usage of cheap labor.   The double standard:  alien returned, but business man gets to keep profit.   That the 2 yr old now a minimum of 12 yrs old crossing border did nothing wrong except being born to brown skin Mother.
@drninaansary Although admirable, this focus may contribute to contentment... But what does it do for aspiration?   I can do 10 push-ups, doing 20 may be better for me health wise.   I earn 50K a year, I may have the capacity to earn 70K and equality suggest 70K, should I accept my lot in life
@SethAMandel @bdomenech And if the man himself said it wasn't true, would you believe him?  With his 2000+ lies could anyone believe him?   And would it matter? it's just another checkbox for the level of depravity that he has descended too.
@AriFleischer You really need to take your meds, or gets some prescribed for your mental health issues if you're not taking any.

@Belairviv Unwanted Sexual touching is still against the law and social mores.  Franken may have had a different measuring stick because he was a comic, but the forced kissing is kinda gross.  He should get a pass just cause he's a D and not an R.  We'd be up in arms if he were an R
@DougHeye Totally disagree! Russia entreated to hack! Gerrymandered districts, Voter suppression, factor in the marginal candidates and those things MAY be enough, then add Russian disinformation and other shenanigans for Trump; one could argue it's irresponsible not to question legitimacy
@krassenstein @MichelottiJoe Or it could be the discovery process is to invasive
@MichelottiJoe @juliemason Edgy, extreme thought and behavior is standard for a comic.  The ? at the inquires whether comic status yields a different measure.   e.g. Coaches and teachers are mandated reporters of abuse, Comics and Developers are not. Do recent testimonials offset those prior deficits?
@juliemason Franken gets a pass because of his prior employment as comedian? Employment Developer Trump get the same pass?   Are Franken supporting testimonials from prior Pol. staff an offset?  Are there similar current Trump testimonials?  Do they carry the same weight with non partisans?
@TimfromDa70s Or if they did, look for the shrunken human heads right next to it.  Ewwww

@McDonaldHeir @Visigoth5157 @ericbolling @realDonaldTrump @POTUS Earning minimum wage is better than 100K because of lower taxes.  Being a 4' tall basketball player is better than 6' tall because you'll learn how to pass rather than shoot!  It's your story, you stick to it.  Having other countries making bilateral  deals is bad for the U.S.
@TrueFactsStated @soychicka It's a race to the birth canal.  And we'll all lose!
@StopTheSpeaker But we don't care about 23 million children's healthcare, we care about tax breaks for the rich and business.
@GeraldoRivera No Geraldo, the yearbook could be fake, and 7, 100 or NO  other women could be unwilling participants in this publicly performed charade.		Regardless if a plurality vote for him, remember the presidential election; he and others like him could be Gov't officials.		See the problem
@Somthin2belivin @valercart74 @DaWallys @ericbolling @realDonaldTrump I know all you rabid righties out there are going to be apologizing for all the nastiness, and admit I was right.   No? I didn't think so.   Here goes anyway.		https://t.co/vqG8U9oRca
@RedfearnsTake @JustMyOpinion_2 @Visigoth5157 @ericbolling @realDonaldTrump @POTUS There's no law against farting in elevators, flipping off your president, tugging on Superman's cape or spitting into the wind.  There are just things that you don't do, because it's unseemly.  That seems to have been lost.  President seems to be one of the biggest violators
@RedfearnsTake @JustMyOpinion_2 @Visigoth5157 @ericbolling @realDonaldTrump @POTUS There are no typical "idiot liberals" we're all unique you just don't have the acuity to see our uniqueness.  Seriously, why you gotta call names and label.  Wrong is Wrong whether I say it or you say it.   I don't want Serial Sexual Assaulters in the Gov't, but Trump was elected
@RedfearnsTake @JustMyOpinion_2 @Visigoth5157 @ericbolling @realDonaldTrump @POTUS This congress does not have the backbone or will to shut him down.  That would require a moral compass that didn't point to serial sexual assaulters, sadly that magnet seems to be diverting  their ship of state.

What was the party of the president who brought us the banking / mortgage debacle.   The answer Democrat (Bill Clinton), The party of the banking crisis: GOP, cleaned up by Obama (D)
@TheWhogg @Visigoth5157 @ericbolling @realDonaldTrump @POTUS Just the opposite.  Efficiency is not a necessary or sufficient quality for Gov't.  Many argue for Gov't efficiency, pointing out the extreme or ridiculous or absurd; avoids a lot of wasted time or should.

@RedfearnsTake @Visigoth5157 @ericbolling @realDonaldTrump @POTUS No it was Trump.  Consorting with Russians; Cold warriors find that divisive.

@valercart74 @DaWallys @ericbolling @realDonaldTrump They're 18 year old kids that spent 3 days as involuntary guests of china, have put their basketball career at risk, may lose their scholarship, and have had to endure the scrutiny of this motley crew.  The scholarship alone if lost is about $200K.  That's a steep sentence.
@KatrinaPierson @RepSpeier Good point, and I'm generally not on your side ;)
@Somthin2belivin @valercart74 @DaWallys @ericbolling @realDonaldTrump I don't think they should have stolen anything.  Souvenir or Sunglasses, it's still not a life sentence to me.

@dxevansjr @ericbolling @realDonaldTrump You're right, Obama's snatching this country from a depression and delivering it to this president with low unemployment and healthy unlike Bush II shows the difference.  He's a great P*ssy grabber by by his own words, though.  No entangling alliances , cause no one likes us now.
@grunt36t @ericbolling @realDonaldTrump You're a realtor, so you're right, the fine points of diplomacy, Government, kindness, and compassion are lost on someone who is governed by the almighty dollar at the expense of their honor.

@Visigoth5157 @ericbolling @realDonaldTrump @POTUS Efficiently getting things done is not the measure of good Gov't.  If so there would be no Yad Vashem, and the Nazi's would have that status.

@Missionurse4Lif @tweet4upatriots @ericbolling @realDonaldTrump @DineshDSouza This is the fallacy of overgeneralization.  One act does not a trend make... a broken analog clock is right twice a day, yet it does not mean it is a good chronograph.
@ericbolling @realDonaldTrump Compare Mexico and China &lt;&gt;.  Trump just met with Xi.  The first meeting between Mex and USA was postponed because of enmity.

@cultcommoncore I believe them... and I believe in the Easter bunny, that Trump respects women, and tells the truth.
