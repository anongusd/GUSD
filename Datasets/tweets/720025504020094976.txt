@Slate If she was a man this wouldn't be a issue. Women can do anything in office a man can do. We aren't made of sugar and spice. We made of intelligence, bravery and sensitivity.
@AOC Thats disappointing to say the least. How unacceptable that thry use these people instead of helping up and out.
@Acosta 4 time failure, so far this year.
@rocknrollgarag1 The Long And Winding Road. They were so young to be so insightful.

@sasha3taylor @Bjorkian15 @TheView @ABC @MeghanMcCain And yell commemts like "why does she get clips" when Joy has a clip. Totally unprofessional on tv. The view is becoming a bad MTV game show from the 90's. Thank goodness for Whoopi's oversight. Why do I watch, hoping for an all out brawl.
@yashar I guess Andy's feet must be huge, if it's a burden to move them at a public event. A bit entitled, is he.
@bannerite Because it was for their ears only. Putting the elite at ease.
@realDonaldTrump Are still sleeping. Cause your dreaming.
@thehill Putin's puppet. Why can't educated lawmakers see this. Money and power are blinding. Unseat the blind.

@CNNPolitics Why wouldn't she be. She's smarter, qualified and has some sort of compassion.
@realDonaldTrump Like the fake news, your little minion Sarah was spewing yesterday. Chis Wallace called her out. Fox news is fake now too. I guess.
@nytimes @ChrisWragge By leaps and bounds the best 2017 movie. We are the Champions, my friends.

@BrianKarem @realDonaldTrump Alternative reality. Thinks everything is a reality show or premiere.

@WillieGeist Saw that too.
@StevenFulop Goverment with a heart. Nice job.
@bbtphan @TheView The show sucked today. Even Whoopi couldn't save that ship, torpedo by Meghan McCain. She is loud, rude, and too opinionated. Sorry View your sinking, where is your Nicole Wallace. Meghan is no where near that level.
@RecWand Meghan has no manners for tv. Not one diplomatic bone in her spoiled entitled life. She must go.
@jilevin Always something to say for people struggling. Nothing but admiration for rich entitled assholes. Something wrong with the attitude of this country.
@PassTheSalty How disgusting this vision is. The USA always was the popular and beloved leader. Everyone wanted to hang with. Trump has ruined any presidential respect. He is the puppet.
@hanniewashere Wow that's crazy. Can't even imagine how scary that was. Be safe.

@Slate Nice at mothers and children. What kind of America is this? Mean, heartless and no humanity. Trumpworld
@auntylala1 @FoxNews @SecNielsen I knew this was their option. Shooting people who want to escape violence. The shining city on the hill has turned into a fortress surrounded by guns.
@mitchellreports @NBCNightlyNews Everyone, but the friend.
@joncoopertweets I hope ABC is just letting the mourning time pass before they get rid of her.
@Randy18888 Men that have no humanity have no empathy.
@DrDenaGrayson @realDonaldTrump You answered your own question, real. The only thing real is the fact that he's a liar and a conman.
@brycetache Thank you for your patriotism and perseverance.
@JonahNRO @DanaPerino Ruined it. Should have renovated it like Grand Central Station. Too bad no one on the decision board was as smart as Jackie O.
@KimKimmieKimber @Scholten4Iowa @DemForceArmy @lhfang Good
@Scholten4Iowa @DemForceArmy @lhfang I guess the citizens of Iowa like to spend THEIR MONEY on their representative dining and drinking at the club. While their trying there best to make a living. He's laughing his ass off at you. Oh yeah, vote for him again. He's awesome.
@Scholten4Iowa @DemForceArmy @lhfang Disgusting behavior thst he would comment if it was a Democrat. I had it with these entitled criminals.
@NewYorker My favorite castle in London. The ravens,  the crown jewels, and the bodies of Henry VIII's headless wives in the chapel floor. Very interesting place. Come in thru Traders Gate. Cheers

@dave_brown24 Conspiracy senators need to be fired. They are lying to the people like a con man.
@susannecraig Nice work. Buying the NY Times today. Must support such dedication. Thank you.
@real_farmacist Your not making it a better place. A richer place for you, a more polluted place. More?
@chrislhayes Thats why he won't release his tax returns. It would be evidence.
@ColMorrisDavis Life knocks you down at the worst times. Thats why overcoming obstacles is so rewarding. Im sorry about your dog.
@DavidCornDC @c_ster @realDonaldTrump So persistent, David. I dont know why it always makes me chuckle. He wont release them, he would be indicted. Exposing criminal activity, he's not that stupid. Or is he.
@dkw56ky @JoyceWhiteVance Don't stop believing.
@dkw56ky @JoyceWhiteVance Not even giving Merrick Garland a hearing. This is payback. Just making it harder and letting Americans really see how out of touch Republicans are. November is so close.
@JoyceWhiteVance Not the normal way. Restrictions on who you can investigate. That's  not a investigation, thats just pretending.
@HoarseWisperer @Rain7777 Wishful thinking. Almost to intelligent for the Republicans to go along with.
@andendall Imagine is liberals heard voices?
@krassenstein @realDonaldTrump No maybe it was the attack on America. Sony Pictures. Trump is always selling us out.
@deejay90192 @LindseyGrahamSC All these politicians applying to Trump using his favorite media. Lying under oath. Stop grandstanding roderic. Truth matters.
@JasonKirell @peterdaou Unbelievable right.
@mcspocky The bravery of Dr. Ford only to be undone by the incentive and out of touch Senators. Also allowing a liar and heavy drinker on to the court.
@aravosis Definitely a big drinker. Loss of memory. Are these good qualities for SCOTUS. Wow standards have been lowered.
@robjgifford @edokeefe @jdickerson @FaceTheNation Cotton only spoke in roderic. Like he's been brainwasher. Has he never spoke to a women. Terrible behavior for a senator.
@CBSNews @FaceTheNation He was awful. He side stepped the entire interview. He's a Trump puppet. The viewers know John wouldnt let up.
@krassenstein Tweets don't ruin your life your actions do. Bullying is always blaming someone else. VOTE NO.
@nytpolitics Also 2 women from NY that were going lobby their own cause. Your going to listen now or in November.
@Lee_in_Iowa The only true thing he said was "I love beer". VOTE NO
@AHamiltonSpirit Kavanaugh is fowl. I don't want Biff from Back to the future on the SCOTUS. Both bullies. VOTE NO.
@rolandscahill Too many, guess tonight will be the "first" time he passes out.
@MollyAbbey2 @medwoman1 @zoyaislove @smalt123 @NateSilver538 A nasty drunk is hard to live with. But you never tell anyone.
@pbrasga @SwampDog4614 @60Minutes Now that's funny.
@SwampDog4614 @60Minutes Ha ha ha
@sirDukeDevin Unless it was for a brewery.
@60Minutes I dont care what Flake says. Two frustrated women from NY hold your elevator, and say your going to listen. Makes a impact. This is democracy at it's finest. The People have spoken. Vote NO
@exoticgamora Doubt it. Men like that never think it's them.
@jonlovett No respect for the law or constitution. He lies under oath, like going to lunch.
@PaulSzoldra @WSJ He lied so many times under oath. He has no respect for the law or constitution.
@chrislhayes It can be fun.
@SafetyPinDaily How would he know. He doesn't listen to briefings and I dont think he even knows where Yeman is. He doesn't have a hotel there, it don't matter.
@DearAuntCrabby Because he been one all along. McCain not here to rope him in.
@tariqnasheed @kshaw58 Three Stooges.
@IngrahamAngle @LindseyGrahamSC More like hijacked by a crazy person.
@shannonrwatts Anyone
@Amy_Siskind No common ground in the party.
@Amy_Siskind I'm more angry that a women is doing the Republicans dirty work. Their playbook is pure evil.
@Julian_Har @JonLemire I DIDNT VOTE FOR HIM. NOT MY PRESIDENT.
@JonLemire Im glad they laughed, not at America, at HIM.
@SafetyPinDaily Liars and hypocrisy at its best.
@NBCPolitics We are the laughing stock of the world. Now that's quite an accomplishment.
@washingtonpost @chrislhayes Because journalists are professional slooths. And your a drunken idiot.
@shannonrwatts @Sully_720 @MomsDemand Good luck in your mission to make things right. Not great, RIGHT.
@Juull_Iiaa @mikeshinoda Your definitely supported, Mike.
@thehill Yes the Democrats have chosen TRUTH. Something new for Republicans.
@notcapnamerica She's no better. Sleep with dogs, your gonna get fleas.
@aravosis They can't even keep track of their lies.
@ThisWeekABC What is wrong with Turtle? He's delusional.
@SafetyPinDaily He needs someone to plow thru him.
@Stop_Trump20 I am, I am.
@CBSNews Good maybe that'll stop testing for this. Not a drug problem. Not a drug.
@PreetBharara Into what, lost democracy, lost justice. I dont want to go anymore. Stop this madness.
@aseitzwald OMG its only Monday. What will happen by Friday?
@DavidCornDC @realDonaldTrump If anything David your persistent. Why would he do think do that. Tax evasion would be the least of it.
@jonathanvswan Now I'm scared justice will never be served.
@ananavarro Can't this just be kept to the character of the nominee. This is not the sins of our fathers. No reason for threats.
@riotwomennn @SenFeinstein Talk about deep state. The Republicans have operated this way for years.
@Bertabright8 I guess they have to shoot someone on 5th Avenue. Oh no, they will get away with it. How much more.
@MichaelAvenatti True patriotism comes in my different forms. Jefferson was a lawyer. Gratsi Michael.
@RadioFreeTom I'm sure there's another rich prep school white kid in khakis. They will try their best spin on this.
@MicAmes @ThisWeekABC I see a reality show.
@ellievan65 @Bornabrit1 @politico He's out of his suppressed gay mind.
@Mikel_Jollett Well shit that would make me definitely vote for him. He's the super hero we've all been waiting for.
@ThisWeekABC I want to go to their family's house for Thanksgiving. In a suit of amour.
@EdKrassen Guilty, but the cover of Republicans will wash over in forgiveness.
@glenn87027633 Nice, but you can't scare the racism out of them. They run to close up their house and mind. Nice try.
@Alt_FedEmployee Why are you surprised. They put a sexual predator in the White House. Did you forget Roy Moore, endorsement by Republicans.
@Slate He's awesome, inventive and has his head in the right place.
@SaysHummingbird If that's how you raise your boys. Get ready for divorce, abuse, and politics. Sad. Women will be rising very soon.
@ananavarro Would have been a great skit on SNL. This is our reality. Not a normal administration.
@AdamsFlaFan @PalmerReport Butter fingers. Next judge that's not a sexual predator or bigot or conservative. Ruth needs support.
@davidfrum @madeleine Rude selfish people. Doesnt she have a security detail. No one should get that close.
@SafetyPinDaily Get rid of this out of touch elitist. You time has come. Things are going to be different then with Professor Hill. Day of reckoning is coming.
@NBCPolitics The Republicans, your time has come. How much more do women have to endure. I believe her, because who would want this.
@KassandraSeven If they add white to that, I'm done.
@chrislhayes Sexual assault is not a crime for Republicans. It a prerequisite for running for office or being nominated.
@thehill Get mad but get it right. Your right Willy.
@joncoopertweets @Kanew This kind of religious extremism is terrorism. Not allowing access to healthcare kills. He is a murderer.
@StopTheSpeaker @kshaw58 Take his salary away and tell him to tough it out.
@MarketWatch It's just so easy. I got 3 packages already this week. He appeals to our busy and lazy lives.
@Politics_PR You are a rising star. Use your powers for good and eliminate all Republicans.
@MamaBear64 @rolandscahill They are basically a companion. And they make minimum wage.
@SpotifyCares Hi. I got a new debit card, when I entered the new one, I forgot to add Hulu. I went back and changed my account. But I still cant log on to hulu.

@chrislhayes At least Booker tries his hardest. Get tough Dems. The Republicans have be fighting dirty for years.
@SallyAlbright Very vocal today. Loving it.
@NicolleDWallace Treasonous.
@NBCNightlyNews Really. I googled that a couple of weeks ago. It said fentanyl overdose. Stop the shame of opiate overdose or it will never stop. Whatever the cause RIP Dolores, you can now sing with the angels.
@ananavarro A normal WH would have no need to issue a statement. Why are they so scared of Trump. Does he own a gun?
@ananavarro Some people think Pence, for an usual word. Not sure. Dan Coats, maybe. Who ever a real patriot.
@AdamsFlaFan Post them on twitter you twit.
@UROCKlive1 TRUMP, KAVANAUGH
@VanityFair Can't wait to see that one. I love rock n roll, especially 1990's. Bonus, Elizabeth Moss is awesome.
@SafetyPinDaily He wants to governor, but can't read his FB. Doesn't know the groups he's in. He had to request, to be admitted. Another liar.
@DanRather We have to clear our head and souls. Then come back fighting. In the fine spirit of a equal rights fighter and a war hero. Democracy is constant work.
@CBSNews Now it gets real. Thanks Republicans for your support, especially the ones supported by newpapers. What's it gonna take for you to wake up.
@NBCPhiladelphia Now that's draining the swamp.
@AdamsFlaFan Out these horrible racists. No place in government. Especially the governor. Ask yourself this is how you want to be represented.
@RepBonnie @pjevans3 Where is the outrage. These Americans should not have to fight their own government to show their a citizen.
@wordsmithviv ABSOLUTELY
@AdamsFlaFan Probably his worst mistake. A fine military family teaming up with white trash. Who's bad idea was that.
@robreiner @PrincessBravato This one is easy, but Republicans are racists and ignorant.

@2020fight These 5 Democrats should be ashamed of themselves. I expect this from soulless Repubicans. Give the people what they want and need. Gun reform, universal background check. Ban all military type assault rifle.
@JohnElliottTV Just awful. Guns laws need to be changed. Saftey first, other nations don't have this issue.
@Tvlbott @Melody_Ball @nbc6 @CBSMiami @NBCNews @wsvn @CBSNews Don't need a police state. And true that is life, but you want to help them by not going to gun control first. That will help. Universal background check. Ban on all milarity assault weapons.

@Melody_Ball @nbc6 @CBSMiami @NBCNews @wsvn @CBSNews Awful the kids hands that are uncontrollable shaking speaks volumes. If you have a soul. Law makers do your job, pass laws that make Americans safe. Not rich from tax cuts. Make a real difference.
@TheOnlyKAVIN @NRA @realDonaldTrump @GOP Good luck going after them. Too rich to influencing to Congressmen and Senators. Nothing will change, except the body count.
@ABCPolitics Then gun reform needs to be addressed. Now. How much more and how many more innocent souls will pay for the NRA's greed and influence.
@chrislhayes Horror is real life in real time. Is this enough for gun reform. I hope so.
@owillis How many more? We as a society are not sick of gun violence in our schools. Senators should be ashamed for not passing gun reform after Sandy Hook. Disgusting NRA

@chrislhayes The hypocrisy of this adminstration is appalling. From Price to Minuchin to those entitled Trump offspring. Robbing American taxpayers.
@jazzyjenni77 @TheOpposition Your a rasist. Immigrants made America better, that's how to make America great. More immigrant comics.

@jilevin And this admistration deines climate change. Too bad to prove them wrong will take time. That old fuck, Trump will be dead.
@LawyerRogelio I think he needs on of his aides to have a card with his name on it. Like your pick up at the airport. Even though the POTUS seal is on it.
@neiltyson Love you Neil, always bringing it. Truth and the universe are one.
@DavidCornDC @realDonaldTrump Any day would be a good day for that. But why would a criminal reveal the evidence.
@thehill Perfectly perfection of a major ass.
@thehill Lordy, the POTUS is a major liar. What kind of leader leads with lie after lie. It's like a spoiled rotten child. Oh wait that is him.
@PreetBharara @deejay90192 @ComedyCentral @TheDailyShow @hasanminhaj Can't wait Phreet. What's ya got on Trump? I hope enough to bring him down, way down. And those moronic children and inlaw, too. Lets go.

@MrDane1982 I'm a life long dem. And she gotta go. A new message needed. Hating Trump not a good enough message. Better, younger voice.
@Mikel_Jollett @ravenshimmers Don't warn them about that. Enjoy now cause in 2018 the house is gonna be ours. Welcome to the neighborhood.
@GovHowardDean You were in charge of the DNC. Think of a surefire way for us to win. 4 RNC wins unacceptable. New vision and message needed for Dems.
@CoryBooker Legalize marijuana recreationally. Tax it and treat it like alcohol. Only its safer. The state needs the money for transportation and school
@ACLU That's perfect, since men don't go to the Dr. Won't cost the government a thing. Disgusting bill. Harming women and children. Trumpcare not.
@mkraju Would that be Pay to play, Trump.

@rocknrollgarag1 A very sad day for all rock fans.
@WienerJaMD @TrueFactsStated I see why they brought in Greta. Get her to soften the viewers. Then bring in the rest of the right winged agenda. Turning slowly into FOX.
@ericgarland Sound the warning. The louder the better. Either your with the Americans or the Russians.
@ABFalecbaldwin @DearAuntCrabby @nbcsnl The only Trump I like. And he's faker than the real one.
@FantasyDWTS Love Lindsey and David. The heart of the show.

@jimsciutto @puppymnkey This administration hasn't a clue. Blame 44. That's his brilliant stragery. Help the Syrian people. How much more must they endorse.
@HuffPostPol The senators should want to work together. American is made up of all kinds. He is a disgrace using an option that will change everything.
@Only4RM @bjorkianrice @BarackObama Since when does this country serve one party and not the other. That is not a democracy. Today the POTUS. Friday the SCOTUS.

@CharlesKehler1 @KattyKayBBC Also you word backup. For an emergency backup would not need to open mines up. No need to double down on production. Better cleaner ways.
@CharlesKehler1 @KattyKayBBC Not coal
@christoq @PrincessBravato @JoyAnnReid He is a complete idiot. But reporting it over and over may give it some credibility to his base. Cable's best soundbits do the most damage.
@RepAdamSchiff Of course WH resisting. Come on now Democrats put on your big boy pants and stop all this. Nuclear plan for GOP. Gorsuch done by Fri. Stop üòñ
@KattyKayBBC Thanks but it doesn't take a genius to figure that out. Just get out a little. Wind solar turbine the energy of the future. Coal past.

@chrislhayes He should be careful that new U.S. attorney's don't indict him or his cabninet.
@marcorubio @_that_kyle If you really mean that then you better think twice about repealing ACA. You don't then you signed a death sentence.
@pharris830 He fired them so he can put in his own people. Maybe then they won't indict him for lying on an interview to congress.
@jheil @djdnice Nice. Props to his people.
@GayleKing Glad to hear it. I have so much more respect for you, no sleep last night and you are so poised and professional. No even sleepy.

@pharris830 The only thing they helped is confirming that their only mission is to destroy Obama's legecy. Only concern is themselves.
@WillieGeist Willie can't please everyone. Just plain ungrateful. Must be a Trump supporter.
@SenWarren Everyone on the Trump cabinet is cozy with Russia.
@EFMoriarty @48hours It is sad but, you have to never forget what he does to innocent women. With no fear. He's scary.
@szirinsky @48hours He's really mentally ill. Dr. Phil would send him to a program. Should be medicated.

@ABC7NY At least one branch of government is sane and working. With the US constitution in its legal rights.
@jonkarl Sad that the press is so disrespected. It keeps the administration honest. No wonder why Trump admin hates everyone but Fox.
