@scott_mintzer @scottdetrow Yes. That's a fair point.	Question is: do they change fast enough for Ds? Obv. if they win WH in 2020 but no Senate, they're very limited.	And if it takes longer, who knows what other shifts emerge elsewhere.

Study in contrasts between Fitzpatrick &amp; MacArthur across the Delaware.  	Fitz kept distance from Trump. Won narrowly. 	MacArthur was in the Rose Garden with POTUS, fund raiser at his golf course. Narrow loss in a Trump+6 district. 	With big caveat: Fitz had very flawed opponent
MacArthur went out on a limb. 	Lots of reps in swing seats play it cautious. He said that by being in the talks, he was actually shaping the big bills instead of just swallowing and voting at the end. 	But lots of his voters saw him too close to Trump. He energized them
DCCC math for why they feel sure of a win. Tough to argue - and I‚Äôve yet to hear any Rs make the case that they think they can pull it out https://t.co/uNN8o9WENq
It‚Äôs a small measure, not scientific, but of all the competitive races in the Philly area, I got the most grassroots feedback from NJ3. 	The backlash against MacArthur after health care was real.
So it‚Äôs looking like Rs will be down to 1 House seat from NJ. Loss of four seats.
@IamAlanStanwyck Ah. Got it. For example last night Kim said ‚Äúwe are confident that when the votes are counted Andy will be the winner.‚Äù And pointed out many of the remaining votes were from Dem friendly Burlington County. MacArthur camp has not laid out any counter points

@exinkygal I think there were *hints* of cracks in Trump's Midwestern states -WI, MI, PA - but hard to draw firm conclusions since he is a unique candidate. Lots could depend on who is against him (as in 2016)
@brianros1 yup. that is a source of concern. suburban folks moving into places like Lancaster
Despite Senate gains, lots of PA Rs pretty down about election results.	They see losses/trends in burbs as a huge problem in statewide races, and esp in the statehouse. Lost a number of state leg seats as well. 	Several don't think it's a sustainable model in a state like PA

When Collins referred to a Democrat who declared opposition to Kavanaugh before he was even nominated, pretty sure she was referring to PAs @SenBobCasey, who did just that.

A handful of GOP senators stood and applauded Collins when she concluded her speech.
If she is a 'no,' then huge pressure on Manchin. His vote would then block Kavanaugh, or effectively confirm him, by creating the 50-50 tie that Pence would break in Kavanaugh's favor https://t.co/6y59zav7O7
If Collins is a 'yes' and no one changes their minds, GOP has the votes for at least a 50-50 vote and a Pence tiebreaker.	Would open door to a Manchin yes, since he wouldn't alter the outcome.

@leberquesgue @AlanKeller3 @Bencjacobs the governor decides the date; and has said he will do so *after* Dent sets an exact date he is leaving
As we spell out here - the election has to be at least 60 days after Dent resigns, so July at the earliest. When Fattah was convicted in June 2016, the special was held alongside the Nov general election: https://t.co/9bmqhxPxq9
By law, there *has* to be a PA special election. The question is when - and if it's concurrent with November's elections or not.
Updated story on @RepCharlieDent resignation plans: the soonest any special election could happen would be July - and there's precedent to suggest it wouldn't happen til November: https://t.co/9bmqhxPxq9
this would be so confusing. some people would be voting on 2 entirely different races https://t.co/AIT7OLEyDR
On the timing of any PA special election: When Philly's Chaka Fattah was convicted in June 2016, Wolf called the special election for that November. The timing on Dent's departure will be very similar.

@ByChrisBrennan In other words, if I had to guess, I'd bet on a special election concurrent with the November general.
Colleague @ByChrisBrennan points on Dent: he doesn't retire til May. And by law any special election has to be 60 days after that - so well after May primary &amp; at soonest July. Would be major $$ for less than 6 months of a term, much of which will be during recess
@baseballot I haven't checked this to be 100% sure, but I have to imagine it would be the old lines - since everyone else is still representing their old districts; if the one district was under new lines there'd almost certainly be overlap for some voters and others who have no rep

PA6 Dem Chrissy Houlahan has $950k on hand. Her only GOP opponent, Greg McCauley, raised $5,250 - including $5,000 from a loan. He has $3,400 on hand
Top Dem fund raisers in crowded PA5 are Mary Gay Scanlon ($404k total for the cycle), Ashley Lunkenheimer ($365k), George Badey ($305k), Molly Sheehan ($204k) and Rich Lazer ($163k). 	The only R in the race, Pearl Kim, has $221k on hand - thanks to a $200k loan
In deep blue PA4, state Rep Madeleine Dean raised $407k - but $250k came from a personal loan; Shira Goodman raised more from donors - $167k - but has less on hand. Ex Congressman Joe Hoeffel raised just $20k
@RepBrianFitz PA3s @RepDwightEvans raised $220k and spent more than half of it - $124k. The primary is the real race for him in that Philly seat.
