Welcome to the age of social slavery. They will give you things, they will make you dependent, then they will have total control of your lives ,finances, and family's. 2020 the democrats will take your very freedom to choose. Say good bye to just doing what you want.
@RealCandaceO @Jewel4Trump The same way that drugs and alcohol are pushed on low income communitys democrats push abortion in an attempt to down size the black population. This is there answer to not sounding racist. It is a back handed plow at race control.
@stripedbanana3 @sfclong Come on danny you live in America why tell lies like that.
Its time we need some democrats arrested. The time is now to stop the lies and corruption
This new generation is willing to give up there freedom to be taken care of and not have responsibility. But do they really understand the down fall of that promise. What does it take to show what our families have died for. Where is the passing of knowledge.

Next trump needs to roll back all rules and legislation turn us in to Mexico. We should not have to learn Spanish to live in an English country.

@SenSchumer @NancyPelosi Well keep it shut down now we don't have to listen to this twit and his brainless minions.
@SenSchumer @NancyPelosi I'm so glad we got a trump shut down. Nice to see a president that will stand for what America wants not. Political pressure. Shummer the old hack. Times are a changing.
@CharlieDaniels Dems don't want anything they can not take credit for.

@MrAndyNgo Are these people for real now we can change millions of years of biology. Will I wake up with a period from watching this. Is that how this works. We have finally fell of the deep end. God help us.
It is the dems fault they said boldly on tv no matter what. No wall today no wall tomorrow on wall next week we see you. Your not john cena.
@robjh1 Half of the country is a different color. People that will just go there must not live in the same reality I live in what are they even talking about. Closing the boarder is just going to make everything white really. And eating grits is the same as oatmeal. Go there you are ther
@Tweets4DJT Look at our future without boarder security America the beautiful.
If you change the rules that congress don't get paid during shut downs we will never have another.
Only the media cares about a shut down we are on Christmas vacation what's a week morons everyone's off anyway.
How much seized boarder money is just sitting in lock up now that we can acquire immediately.
@RealDeanCain No place like home
@realDonaldTrump Make Pelosi, McConnell ,and shummer sign it or add it into the government funding deal. Then we have funding for life ever time someone tries to sneek in with drug money. Win, win me president they don't give you funding but get what we want.
@realDonaldTrump Sign an executive order that all drug money and weapon money seized from boarder goes exclusively to boarder wall and security. Use Mexico's money to fund the wall. Mexico will pay for it one way or the other how much money is confiscated yearly. That checks two promises.
@bonniemurphy @MazurikL @KAGHarleyQuinn @ChuckGrassley Dems like americans that have ask for help from the government that called control not freedom.if we were truly self reliant the wild lose there power.

Do you know the embarrassment if dems cannot come together and the American people fund the wall. You couldn't even do your job so we had to do it for you. Why are you there again.
We elect a president to be the boss. And in any situation if your boss tells you to work and what he wants done you would do it. I think they have forgotten who is in charge. Its time to shake the cage.

Nancy Pelosi does not need to be speaker. Here negotiating skills are so far in the past I see her coming back around. 2020 the Democratic part is done. They will never recover from this one.
@SenSchumer @realDonaldTrump America is with president on this one your a fool.
@SenSchumer @realDonaldTrump Shut it down we don't care .but shut it down without pay.

Americans are tired of excuses! We want the wall! Congress needs to fund the wall before they leave for the holidays. Click here to email your Congressman: https://t.co/KpYXdj2HFB #FundTheWall #NoExcuses
@realDonaldTrump Stiil don't see any proof on helping to hack the election. Is that not what we set out for what's this carp who cares about stormy Daniels is she sleeping with Putin.
@realDonaldTrump should shake things up call Sarah Palin get her invoked in administration
@ACTforAmerica Because some states allow non citizens to vote and as long as dems are handing out government assistance to no citizens then they vote dem and they guarantee they stay in power.
@andersonDrLJA Dems have worked hard to make sure we can not think for ourselves. That's why they push big gov so we become reliant and compliant. Were is America when we speak but are not heard. That's what we done when we elected trump and  want to shut us up. Should be ashamed to vote dem.
@smerconish @Ea1785 When is CNN going to get back to reporting the news I'm so over trump talk that doesn't go anywhere its bad when you have to turn the channel to find out what's going on in the world. Then you turn back and they are still beating the horse.
@SarahPalinUSA Guess should have stayed home. Oh home would not have paid for all of your care food and housing for free at the tax payers expense.
@RodStryker @mwam1993 Dosent she have to get approval from the speaker of the house to subpoena or indite . don't think that's going any where.
@realDonaldTrump Rosenstein needs to go back stabber working back channels in sucluison.
@DailyCaller She don't even know what a subpoena is.
@Jim_Jordan They also need to raise the income limits for middle class that struggle to stay ahead.
@Jim_Jordan I think the only way you should be able to keep food stamps after the first 6 months is to at least work 15 hours a week. If you can't do that there is something wrong.

@Alex_LandShark @ILOVERAFA1 @justjae_07 @PoirotNancy @realDonaldTrump Yea they don't do that here I work with low income families and what free insurance they get you can't just go see anyone you want.they want to give universal but the taxes would destroy everyone.
@Alex_LandShark @ILOVERAFA1 @justjae_07 @PoirotNancy @realDonaldTrump 7.25 is min here there is no way the could charge us like that
@ILOVERAFA1 @Alex_LandShark @justjae_07 @PoirotNancy @realDonaldTrump I just can't imagine paying that much in taxes.they would have to dramiticaly raise wages.
@justjae_07 @Alex_LandShark @ILOVERAFA1 @PoirotNancy @realDonaldTrump Ok
@Alex_LandShark @justjae_07 @ILOVERAFA1 @PoirotNancy @realDonaldTrump Man I hope my country don't do that to me I could not imagine paying that much in taxes I enjoy my money to much. Thanks for the info.
@Alex_LandShark @justjae_07 @ILOVERAFA1 @PoirotNancy @realDonaldTrump But its all paid by the government with your tax money doctors don't work for free medical equipment is not free medical company's don't hand meds for free its still paid for
This is our future if dems raise taxes and give use universal health care https://t.co/roSHVoyf0Q
@Alex_LandShark @justjae_07 @ILOVERAFA1 @PoirotNancy @realDonaldTrump 21.5 oh my god
@Alex_LandShark @justjae_07 @ILOVERAFA1 @PoirotNancy @realDonaldTrump Man see that's what pays everyone's health care my taxes are like 1200 dollars a year. And I make more than you.
There is a kid in the UK that thinks because she goes to a doctor and pays that its free. Lol that doctor visit come off the back of hard working people taxes . nothing is free its paid for one way or another
@justjae_07 @Alex_LandShark @ILOVERAFA1 @PoirotNancy @realDonaldTrump There is nothing free taxes pay for your care so you and all of your people pay to see doctor. If you found doctors that don't liked to be paid for there service send them this way. You might want to do some research
@Alex_LandShark @justjae_07 @ILOVERAFA1 @PoirotNancy @realDonaldTrump So how high are your all's taxes
@justjae_07 @ILOVERAFA1 @PoirotNancy @realDonaldTrump It has to be paid for out of taxes its not free.

@dawnlyndel @realDonaldTrump It is like this morning I heard the dems all ready got a tax bill on the floor to raise taxes more than was city. So there goes our pay checks that 400 a week just went to 250
@justjae_07 @ILOVERAFA1 @PoirotNancy @realDonaldTrump Health care is so much better than money if you have a job you can get health care. If they give it to you for free everyone pays for it. And you have to wait on approval to see doctor can't just go when you want.

Its not a right its a privlage and a conveyance.
The president should just temporarily shut down the white house press core .
@brianstelter Don't see how press or not you can sue someone that don't want you in there place of buissness
@dbongino The problem is the press fella they should come and go as they please and there is and should always be boundaries. Just because your press don't make you god.
@MarshaBlackburn Glad your there lets get some major  work under our belt.
@senatemajldr @GOP Congratulations leta finish our agenda
@RealDeanCain Don't feel just because man or woman makes your perception any different .
@dbongino Then America would see lack of evidence
@dbongino If the president just in classified all the documents on Russia investigation would that not pretty much stop the investigation.
@jancappy @dbongino Maybe he should appoint new ag and move Whittaker to assistant at less drama
@dbongino If we pick new ag it will be same carp .dems want rosenstein in charge of investigation he has something to hide fire rosenstein
@seanhannity No one should care unless its Hillary for her part in Russian meddling
@AmiHorowitz @dbongino @RealDeanCain @therealroseanne @benshapiro @realDonaldTrump How many of these people will get visas and over stay and just never leave. How many will be on food stamps and government housing , costing me and others millions of dollars year, and how many will look for vulnerable white woman to marry in hopes to stay here. Change soon.
@theresa_may Just keep working forward America is with you
@dbongino If she's on her way to Washington wait till she gets a load of trump.

I say just ban press core in white house period just takes away from daily https://t.co/XbhLpdu9Qh core was set up so presidents could get out the news quickly its not a given..
@MarylouMorning @AnneLouisianne They have freedom of speech and press not the right to do it in the white house that is a privlage.
@joltnjoey @tom_rueck @TJUndertaker @CatieGus @SenSchumer Lol then you would become an illegal immigrant your self that's funny.
@CatieGus @SenSchumer The house committee is there to judge job performance not tell some one what to do. That is obstruction of justice. Trying to force an out come.
@rendajbr @realDonaldTrump I believe rosenstein chose Whitaker to get him out from under Muller probe to save him from losing his job. But think he should still be fired.
@realDonaldTrump Matthew Whittaker should file restraining order against house committee they are there to judge his work performance not harass him on how to do his job.that obstruction.
@realDonaldTrump A star gets hottest before it burns out our sun is slowly heating up all the recycling in the world won't stop what's eventually going to happen

@ChuckGrassley Thank you to our vets I have had a lot of family in military. Your a good man chuck
@ninavizz @realDonaldTrump It is domestic terrorism if we allow endless amounts of people to come that will disrupt American life when we have to house feed and cloth a whole nation.when we have homeless we can not take care of.
@realDonaldTrump If can get past drama we should start a coalition with Mexico and just move our troops to Mexico Guatemala boarder
@tomdryan @etainalon @BrandonScovill @voxdotcom It is a better life here in my opinion but I feel when you have a bag of cookies and share with everyone eventually you end up with none.the American people can not affors to bring a whole country in here and me and you have to pay to support them
@JeffFlake @ChrisCoons Why do we have to protect the investigation when rosestein said his self no Americans were involved in in election meddling . just don't make sense.
If rosenstein is not in charge of Muller investigation anymore why is he still in office
@BrandonScovill @tomdryan @voxdotcom Yea maybe should just let them all in if take 100 dollars every check from Americans to house and feed them .most of them can speak English how they going to get job .call it immigrant tax
@realDonaldTrump They must have fell off the truck
@SenWarren @realDonaldTrump I thought the wealth people supplies us with jobs. I don't see how taxing them and making them fire people to make the difference up is helping our economy. But guess that's why we have been in this the past 25 years
@SenWarren @realDonaldTrump I thought that the wealthy was the people the owned the company's that supplies the jobs if we tax them to death ovisley they would fire people to make up difference .so we're is the tax point. I don't see how tax thw rich is going to solve anything
@dakotawolfie @PaulaCobia @realDonaldTrump May be we could let all the immigrants just come in to show our compassion. We could start a immigrant tax and take 100 a month out of every americans check to house and feed them.
300 million from law suit donated on wall lol sounds like victory
That's pure defamation and slander.
Break them finacialy for ever.
Its true that maybe Russians spread liea to try to influence votes. But where does that have anything to do with hacking the dnc. The media and dems just keep repeating the same crap. If mullear comes back saying no collision I would file the biggest law suit against the dnc .
@ChinaDaily Its time we come to a equal agreement and continue down the road .our future could be so bright.
Its about time real decisions are made 2 years wasted.when our country could be going up and over can keep dragging this same old song.
@realDonaldTrump About time we got rid of that spineless weasel.
