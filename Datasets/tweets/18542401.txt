Of course, none of this surprises me coming from the current Republican party, and because the bill is so unpopular and harmful you shouldn't be surprised either when Democrats kick you out in 2018. Enjoy it while it lasts, @SpeakerRyan. #GOPTaxScam
And it's craven because it includes irrelevant pet projects, targets blue states, and takes advantage of a president whose legitimacy is in question and whose behavior you've sworn to check. #GOPTaxScam
It's corrupt because it contains lots of goodies specifically for donors and legislators themselves, such as the famous #CorkerKickback. #GOPTaxScam
It's hypocritical because it breaks any  commitment to a transparent, bipartisan process that allows for any meaningful study or consideration by experts or the public, and despite hostility to deficit spending is unpaid for by nearly $1.5 trillion. #GOPTaxScam
It's dishonest because it will not lower taxes for the middle or working class; in fact, all available evidence demonstrates that it will raise taxes for nearly 90 million families and cost 13 million people healthcare over the next decade. #GOPTaxScam
Congratulations, @HouseGOP. You can't be blamed for wanting to lower taxes, but you've managed to pass a bill that in substance and process is as unpopular and harmful as it is dishonest, hypocritical, corrupt, and craven. #GOPTaxScam

The purpose of Obamacare is to ensure that what determines whether one lives or dies won't be that person's ability to afford health care.

It is auspicious that the Republicans' last chance to repeal Obamacare with a simple majority, falls exactly on Yom Kippur.
