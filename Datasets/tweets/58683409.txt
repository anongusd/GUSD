@JoshZumbrun @andreweilts I'll take it. And you were certainly right a few weeks back with your first prediction.
@JoshZumbrun @peteschroeder And Reid would have come out of the hospital if needed. She had 60 if it were necessary.
@JoshZumbrun I mean, kinda. She would have gotten 60 votes if all senators were present. It wasn't a real test, so there were no-shows.
@mkraju Yeah, but they would have had at least 60 votes had everyone voted, so...
@BCAppelbaum They'd have snapped if they'd had to work one more day.
@peteschroeder @JoshZumbrun Right, the nuke is far more determinative, methinks. Manchin is also just... kind of an oddball.
@JoshZumbrun @peteschroeder Bernanke had 30 'No' votes. It's possible re: taper, but I still think vast majority of Rs vote against.
@peteschroeder I think not. @JoshZumbrun has convinced me she's going to break Bernanke's record of nays.

@JoshZumbrun Right, I hear you. McCain, who helped out in the last nominations fight, is also against her. OTOH: it's a historic vote.

Yellen handled confirmation hearing like a pro. Whether she won any R votes is unclear; Johanns and Corker seem possible, at the least.
Clearly, many senators do not understand what the Fed can, and cannot, do.
@JimPethokoukis High inflation is just around the corner. No, the other corner. No, no, the one around that one.
