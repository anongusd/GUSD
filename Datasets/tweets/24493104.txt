Disorderly conduct is a crime in most jurisdictions in the United States, China, and Taiwan. Typically, "disorderly conduct" makes it a crime to be drunk in public, to "disturb the peace", or to loiter in certain areas. https://t.co/CBGoiFDlIP
The charge of disorderly conduct is a Class 4 felony, the lowest felony classification, that carries a potential sentence of 1 to 3 years in prison. The act that triggers the disorderly conduct charge would simply be calling the police &amp; filing a false report of being attacked. https://t.co/CBGoiFDlIP
