More from @SecNielsen on GOP-led Congress not moving on @realDonaldTrump immigration demands. "I think it's a timing issue, meaning that they are just never in session. Right. They take lots of recesses. They have other things to do. We've encouraged them to stay in session."
To reporters just now @SecNielsen  on relationship w @realDonaldTrump "We have a very strong relationship. I think what is true is we are both really frustrated. We need Congress to act. The law is broken." Was #POTUS frustrated with your leadership? "Not that I believe so, no."

As far as talks @realDonaldTrump will meet today at #WhiteHouse with Chinese trade leader, Vice Premier Liu He -- for U.S. team, @larry_kudlow says @stevenmnuchin1 running point &amp; Navarro (trade adviser) will attend. Kudlow on Navarro: "He'a a member of our team and a smart guy"
On trade talks with #China @larry_kudlow "This is a great opportunity for us to move the ball in the right direction and the Chinese seem amenable and we are expecting some documents from them, some new proposals. I'm sure this is going to be a lengthy process."
Just now @larry_kudlow on #ZTE "The president is responding to a request from President Xi to take another look at it. That's what we're doing. Secretary Ross...has always regarded this as an enforcement issue, not a trade issue. They will take a look at the remedies."
