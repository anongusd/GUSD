"... I am also aware that if people who have spoken out — like me — do not take this sort of a stand then things are very unlikely to change at anything like the pace required to protect my daughter’s generation." https://t.co/Ehyt3KbOxs
And ultimately the long-game here surfacing these critiques may not lead to any change immediately for those directly impacted but it will be a part of larger sea change. Lasseter may be chilling in the cut for a minute. But momentum is important. Saying something matters.
I keep excerpting tweets from Emma Thompson because this letter is stunning and example of critical questions we should start to condition ourselves to ask with more regularity. Who is being burdened and who is benefiting from those burdens?
"I am well aware that centuries of entitlement to women’s bodies whether they like it or not is not going to change overnight. Or in a year." https://t.co/Ehyt3KbOxs
I always like to say that it is important to do the right thing not for you but for the person coming up behind you.
Dummies argue with me about the perceived pointlessness of speaking out, that it will not benefit them. To be fair, I do not believe anyone should set themselves on fire to keep someone else warm. Your safety and security matters too. 		But I'm not here to rationalize complicity.
Emma Thompson got the memo... "But I can only do what feels right during these difficult times of transition and collective consciousness raising." https://t.co/Ehyt3KbOxs
At the end of the day, doing the right thing is always the right thing. It may be hard. It may make you unpopular. It may be logistically undesirable. But it does not make it LESS right.
I remain simultaneously baffled and (knowing the players), unsurprised 😑
This is not ancient history, for the record. This was just last year. A retreat center for social change leaders that purports to care for the safety of women and people of color had to be *repeatedly* pressed to not host a man who has admitted to serial sexual misconduct.
This reminds me how a well-known retreat center in Canada (hi, Hollyhock!) refused to cancel hosting a facilitator known for serial sexual misconduct (Gibrán Rivera!) and only did after someone with actual integrity wrote a letter very similar to this: https://t.co/Ehyt3KbOxs

@kimbui @NiemanLab totally! I think I told this to some of @zackstanton's interns: pay attention to what everyone is complaining about/is afraid of because that is where all the power lives. for my entire journalism life everyone has been fearful of digital.
@kimbui @NiemanLab ... because what you'll see intentions are always good but execution + impact mixed. you'll see that support is needed level of leadership as well. and it will be a whole new discovery process to realize what that looks like and how to resource it so this next gen can thrive.
@kimbui @NiemanLab imo, y'all were never really "misfits" just never given a clear lane to power + decision-making until now and only because of market disruption. disruption is always disorienting. so I always say to watch what people do when they're given power...

I bring up the article that inspired this thread to reiterate: There is always a game being played around you. Inequities are by design, not default. You don't have to wait to change the system. Wake up. Use the power and privileges already in your hands.	https://t.co/GQRIsRall4
We are still tight, we are still friends. But I used to overly credit them with saving my life until I realized I saved theirs too and really calling it "saving" is a little unfair to all of us. We helped each other. No one needed saving. We saved ourselves.
We helped each other.
As a result, our shared successes were way way more fun and our journeys never lonely. Horizontal loyalty.
The one benefit zooming out and depersonalizing the asshole nature of our peers gave me is I never let the new system I was in tell me I wasn't enough or lost trust that I know what's best for me. For my teammates/tutors, I saw that rub off on them in big and small ways.
I already knew how to dial-in focus and pick up material super fast (thanks to all the Islamic schools I got kicked out of! 🙋🏽‍♀️) but those girls, in a major way, saved my life. They taught me the social norms for the new world I found bewildering. They taught me how to study.
So we formed this after-school/post-practice study club. 		You know the saying, if you really want to learn something, teach it? My soccer teammates TAUGHT ME the course material I was jumping into as a way to master the subject for themselves.
I was WOEFULLY behind in *everything*. 	I either had to get caught up fast or fail back to mall job application English class...
They couldn't afford the fancy tutors our asshole classmates were using to psychologically bludgeon one another...
Here's the horizontal leveler: we were ALL poor.
Remember those girls from my soccer team who, through a totally casual conversation, unknowingly tipped their cards that they were receiving a drastically upgraded education than me? 		They got me caught up in my classes. 	https://t.co/rFvszXziex
Which brings me back to this concept of Horizontal Loyalty...	(again, for reference: https://t.co/aObzhQP9Hj)
There were resources like private tutors available for the students who were already in this upper echelon track to get competitive edges on one another but the burden to get caught up to where they already were was 100% on me
Being unnecessarily fucked with in this new system felt way more explicit in this new system because they had soooo much but like, no one *in it* could see that. Does that make sense?
Hence, the benevolent forgery!
"Oh this is how *this* system tells you you're not enough. Scarcity! Competition! This is why you're all assholes!" I knew enough to understand the old system I came from only said I wasn't enough when I wanted more. It didn't push you if you did not push it.
I was initially confused as to why and almost *internalized* it in a "wah wah they all hate me" kinda way like any teenager would until I zoomed out and looked at it as my father's daughter, as a systems-thinker and realized...
I bring this up because when the schedule change was triggered and I was in all new courses, the culture clash with my new classmates was harsh and severe. They were for the most part (and to put it bluntly) unnecessarily competitive raging assholes.
What's horizontal loyalty? 🧐	Good question! 🤓	In a UC Berkeley J-School commencement speech, @rkrulwich put a name to a practice I always believed but did not have the language for. 	Check out this resource to learn more: https://t.co/aObzhQP9Hj
Following the breadcrumbs, that experience in tracking and trajectory change is one of the reasons trusting myself and horizontal loyalty are core pieces to my personal operating principles today...

IT SHOULDN'T HAVE TO BE LIKE THIS. 	//fin.
And I also wonder and rage at the collective brilliance and ingenuity are our communities missing out on because these broken systems hinder us from investing in the diamonds among us.
I think a lot about people just like me who weren't as lucky or stubborn or who just don't know for all the reasons systems like these keep us blind and I think "It shouldn't have to be like this for you too!"
It shouldn't have to be like that!
I think about those series of events *all the time* 	How much circumstance, social circles, stubbornness and stupid luck played into CHANGING THE TRAJECTORY OF MY ENTIRE LIFE.
A whole new world opened up to me. My entire life changed.
And the change triggered me into advanced placement for everything else. It put me on the path to college I did not even know I was not on for all the reasons someone like me was not on that path (immigrant! poor! lady!)
I was reading Hamlet!
By the end of the week, I had a new course schedule.
Dropped it off in my guidance counselor's mailbox. 	Went back to class. 	Worked on my "resume" 🙄
I went to the bathroom and using my hall pass to the bathroom as a guide, forged my English teacher's signature on the change form slip.
That lady shrugged and gave me the change form slip to fill out.
Instead of the bathroom, I went to my guidance counselor's office, knocked on the door and said, "Hey! I want to read Hamlet!"
Instead of crying, I asked for a hall pass to the bathroom. She obliged.
She laughed in my face.
So the next day I went to my English teacher and said, "Hey! I want to read Hamlet!"
I remembered thinking "I want to read Hamlet!"
During warm-ups girls on my team were talking about what they did in English class today day. They were reading Hamlet. Meanwhile *my* English class assignment was to (I am not joking) pick up job applications at the mall and work on our "resumes"...
There is always a game being played around you. I didn't realize I was tracked until, ironically, soccer season began... https://t.co/GQRIsRall4

I consider myself a reasonably smart person. I speak a bunch of languages. I'm an okay programmer. I'm excellent at my job. Yes it fucking occurred to me to get a fucking assistant or a nanny or whatever-the-fuck you're suggesting because you're only half-listening to me...
Now I'm pretty sure, "Why don't get your assistant to do something like this for you?" is the new annoying unhelpful question of the day.
10 years ago while I was juggling taking care of my nephew + my career + everything, the world's most unhelpful suggestion was "Why don't get you a nanny?" We did. Nannies get days off too ya know. Also how is this helpful? Did I ask for outsourcing guidance?
And then they will feel bad (because THEY SHOULD) and then we'll do the thing where I now have to make *them* feel better and every question about why I'm an introvert who aggressively limits interacting with others and fiercely protects her personal time is answered.
I complain about something like this and someone will unhelpfully suggest I have my assistant do dumb shit like this for me and I will get to point out, for the hundredth time, that my beloved assistant/slash/pillar to my infrastructure very recently and unexpectedly DIED.

People should be treated with dignity and respect IRL and on their platform. A company with a multi-billion dollar valuation has more than enough resources to ensure there are systems in place to achieve that.
Hosts reported for verbal assault should not be given additional forums to harass people. https://t.co/CvVkfFzqrQ
I will NOT thank @Airbnb for reluctantly doing the right thing (after being asked 4x and only responding to public pressure) because frankly the opportunity for the wrong thing should have never presented itself in the first place.
I would feel better if they said something more direct like: we have determined that it is in our community’s best interest to remove it from your public profile BECAUSE IT IS RACIST. 		But I get it. https://t.co/yTyEo8Gj55
Ultimately, Airbnb decided to the unhinged racist review. Not because it was racist but because “we have determined that it is in our community’s best interest to remove it from your public profile.”
But still, it was an exhausting draining circuitous conversation. They promised to follow up with me but I had zero clarity on where exactly a decision would land. It all seemed kinda ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ 		I left that convo to go straight into another meeting, promptly burst into tears.
It was an exhausting draining circuitous conversation about how dog whistle racism works and coded language. I will concede that it was with a kind professional who was AWARE she was asking me to perform a labor and I respected that.
@nicoleindc nah, I'm not even.
That is excellent feedback and she promised to pass along to the relevant teams responsible for addressing that.		Ok... https://t.co/2b4ttk0kTC
We talked a lot about the content policy and interpretations. I repeatedly asked how someone reported for verbal assault is even able to be given the opportunity violate @Airbnb's content policy in the first place?

The stunning thing here is how @Airbnb allows hosts that you REPORTED TO THEM FOR HARASSMENT still leave *you* a review. As if a HOST YOU REPORTED FOR HARASSMENT is someone who should be given any additional forum to opine on your personhood. @AirbnbHelp 		https://t.co/sAAlAHl9c7
Anyway, I hope I don't have to come back here tomorrow and tell that not-so-fun, actually scary story. While I have a LONG unhinged diatribe from this person to creatively tweet, racism is deeply exhausting and I have more pressing things to do with my time. cc @ktbenner
I'm no UX expert but I'm *pretty* sure if a someone has to lodge an official complaint for harassment and call @Airbnb from a car and says THEY ARE SCARED OF THIS HOST then they probably shouldn't be allowed to leave *you* a review or be given any forum to judge your personhood.
@MonicaCarmean @Airbnb @AirbnbHelp @bchesky @ktbenner I will if they don't remove an unhinged woman's racist review! Which I'm STUNNED they even allowed in the first place as I called them from a car and said I AM SCARED OF THIS PERSON.
Y'all. Let us hope beyond hope that @Airbnb &amp; @AirbnbHelp &amp; @bchesky does the right thing and I don't have to come back here tomorrow and tell you all about how they're allowing unhinged host I reported to them for harassment leave me a scathing racist review. cc @ktbenner

This random tweetstorm brought to you by an annoying targeted ad and my long, precise memory of so-called public interest tech folks kicking it at that Trump tech meeting 👀
Public interest tech is not the same thing as human rights tech because human rights are not conditional and it is something we are *all* due. Not just when it’s politically convenient.
Your rights are your rights are your rights are your rights. To apply a technologist solutions framework to that means holding to a standard with how technology is built, developed, deployed and integrated into our lives, society and culture.
When no. That’s not how human rights works. That’s now how any of this works...
The problem with conflating public interest tech with human rights tech can be seen with the ease a lot of well-meaning yet misguided folks frame objectively horrible tech solutions as worthwhile because of perceived benefit for the broader public.

@KTravisBallie @JessPaceLA We both know WW who can turn out to unpaid events that qualify them for council are also likely being pipelined into other roles/board positions that position them for continued access, power, etc. It is just as much on them to ask who isn't at the table and why.
@KTravisBallie @JessPaceLA Travis, it's okay and it's not totally on you. I know how this world and movement works. If WOC are not turning out to events the responsibility to interrogate that and do better does not only fall on you. Also on those who DO turn out.
