@realDonaldTrump What on Earth is the matter with you? No really? Not trying to be snarky and we are nonpartisan. But you really need to get a grip and resign, immediately - if not sooner. Wvery middle school SGA president in the country eould be better at being POTUS than you are now...

@realDonaldTrump @cindyhydesmith 'Respected by all' Really? She suggested support for suppressing the right of folks to vote and made a joke out of lynching. VoterEngage is a non-partisan platform but the thought of Hyde-Smith winning a US Senate seat in 2018 is absurd. As is you support of her. #govote #MSsen
@cindyhydesmith @realDonaldTrump Get out and vote like you've never voted before on Nov 27th. Learn more about the candidates at https://t.co/Uz1wQQKvuo. And don't miss the debate tonight! This is a big one folks!!

@kylegriffin1 Don't be deterred! Here in Hawaii it was just a 10 min wait but turnout was great. Everything ran super smooth and efficient for us. If we were in GA or elsewhere with problems we'd get mobilized &amp;  bring those folks waiting in line snacks &amp; water. If you can help,  please do so!

Too often people claim they didn't vote because of a mistaken belief that their individual vote doesn't matter. Really?

@brianschatz One of the primary reasons why we built VoterEngage was to provide young people with a modern tool to learn about the issues and candidates in a simple, easy, non-partisan platform. When only 26% of 18-24 year olds plan to vote we have to find better ways to connect. #govote
Get out and vote folks!!! It's absurd that you would sit at home when you have the opportunity to choose your own leaders. Make sure your voice is heard on the direction of your community, your state, and your nation and encourage others to do the same! #voteHawaii #govote https://t.co/isSuqDRBkT

@Lydia_MarieM @repjohnlewis @GOP Just keep going. Encourage as many people as possible to vote. Get after it and get it done. Don't stop pushing regardless of the perceived outcome. Seek to elect candidates who believe in the American Democracy and will defend the people over big biz and $. We've got this.
@repjohnlewis Happy Halloween. Now look at the image below. Millions of people have given their very lives to defend the idea of Democracy and the sacred right to choose our own leaders.

@repjohnlewis How on Earth did we allow the media to corrupt the very idea that we are all Americans. There is no red team vs. blue team. There is OUR team. Let's work together and create a better society. A better life for our child. A healthier planet. And a better world. Nov. 6th. #civility
And all we have to do is pull a lever...Could you look Rep. Lewis in the eye in person if he asked you and you had to admit you didn't vote. Think about that long and hard. https://t.co/yiLIYp41dz
@repjohnlewis I would march with you through the fires of hell to stand up for what is right. You are a true inspiration. I have kept a pic of you and MLK Jr. in Selma on my wall since I was a child. Your courage to do what is right is beyond remarkable. (And I'm white. (Not that it matters.))
