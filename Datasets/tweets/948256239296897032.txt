@ananavarro Congratulations!!
Keep up the good fight to keep toxic Rockwool OUT of Jefferson Xounty WV!
@SteveKingIA Sickening, typical Republican cruelty. Dump Trump.
@HuffPost Perhaps this obnoxious creep will also check out of commentary. Enjoy your at home delivery, moron.
Rapper TI posted a Milania Trump look alike doing a strip tease in the oval office. This raucous joke was said to cause  the first lady's outrage. Why? Nude photos of Mrs.Trump can be seen on line by any American child.. Milania, whom I respect, needs to grow a sense of humor.
@FlossieFortuna @washingtonpost @nytimes UGH!
Trump has praised the elected thug that body slammed a newspaper reporter for asking an unwanted question. Maybe Trump was body slammed, explaining why he behaves like a thug. Free Milania!
Trump does not feel it is necessary for the president of the United States to visit our valiant troops in Afghanistan. Why should he?	 Trump and his useless children have done nothing for our country.  He and they are a national disgrace
@Independent Shoot him with arrows, he murdered a whole family.
@CNN Naturally
@FoxNews @POTUS And the dumbest president ever!
@TheSun Adorable Will
@nytimes Who cares?
@NYDailyNews Execute him in depends!
@CCARRanson @StopRockwool STOP TOXIC ROCKWOOL!
@mkraju LIAR
@dbongino And you Bongo Bongo are 1/523 paets human!
In his most asinine moment to date, Trump now has posted a preposterous painting of himself depicted as slim and handsome, seated with recent and past Republican presidents. Trump is delusional. Dump Trump!
Obama was a weak, ineffectual president. His apathy led to the rise of murderous Islamic terrorists. All the Democrats choices for 2020 are  poor!
Bush W killed so many soldiers needless killed in a fake Iraq war. Then Katrina!
Trump is the president with the worst character in recent history. Johnson had thousands o Americans killed in Vietnam.Bush W killed so many
Milania Trump's interview excerpt are a joke. She claims Trump supports chain migration, maybe for her family. No nation should have a firsts lady's naked photos available on the Net for our children to see. And the "i really don't care excuse" just plain stupid. Dump the Trumps!
The Gulf Coast is ravaged by Hurricane Michael and our great president had time to host Kanye West, the psychopath to the oval office. Disgraceful! Dump Trump!
@Noahpinion @ForeignAffairs @reihan No we need low skilled workers too. These hardworking people populate Mc Donalds, supermarkets and Walmart and deserve a break. My grandmother started as a maid in 1907 married an American jerk and in spite of him raised four kids and owned her own house.
@WTOP That is quite an overstatement, but her feelings are her own.
@EddieZipperer And you are STILL a jerk.
@maggieNYT He appreciates strong men who just happen to be murderers.
@StormyDaniels Go girl. porn stars have rights. And you are a very smart one. Just button up on tv to keep your dignity.
@guardian Ahhh, boo hoo!
@NYDailyNews She was wrong but very dignified.
@DLoesch Which he certainly is.
@theblaze The baker has freedom of religion rights too. Same as in  USA.
@Acosta Lock Trump up!
@mkraju And Trump should get a sentence for groping.
@FoxFriendsFirst I thought that was his hairy butt.
@foxandfriends Only one, don't think so...
@Independent Still, killing an innocent unborn child is barbaric.
@LouDobbs @POTUS Lou Dead
@VP @nikkihaley Beauty and the beast!
@HeatherChilders @RDR_NYC @FoxNews @FoxFriendsFirst Very nice  except for Pirro!
@dbongino From a former police swamp rat!
@realDonaldTrump That's one good reason to vote against Stapleton!
@guardian Oh boy, why not just wear a damn sun hat?
@dbongino Yeah socialism like social security and health care, nutjob!
@MailOnline No leash laws in the Philippines, why?
@JudgeJeanine ick
@thehill ...Not really...!
@nytimes President Trump must not forget these good citizens of the USA!
Adorable and immensely talented Taylor Swift worth 300 million slammed ,,Trump and his political cohorts. Good for her. Trump hates strong, gorgeous, talented powerful women. Taylor's all that. Free Milania!
To thepeole of Florida, "Get the hell off the beach!"
@MailOnline Large men and all obese people. Save the donkeys!
@ShannonBream @nikkihaley @foxnewsnight @FoxNews Hillary Clinton!
@seanhannity Hannity, you stink! Lloyd Harbor elitist!
@realDonaldTrump Sure and they paid people to vote for you.
@DailyCaller I give Carlos Danger one month before he's in hot water!
@shearm @realDonaldTrump @PressSec Free Nikki!
@TomFitton @JudicialWatch @realDonaldTrump Blewth!
@WestVirginiaIWW Let me guess, the the board needs to see the results of a study, right?
@ainsleyearhardt @robertjeffress Pastor?
@VP Pence, you jerk.
@CCARRanson We still can do this. I donated $50. Dump Toxic Rockwool!
@RoadMN @seanhannity @TuckerCarlson @IngrahamAngle @TheFive @DanaPerino @greggutfeld @JesseBWatters @kilmeade @donnabrazile @ShepNewsTeam @AmericaNewsroom @BillHemmer @SandraSmithFox @SpecialReport @TeamCavuto @marthamaccallum Numbers 1-3 are the despiciables!

@Alyssa_Milano Yup, they deserve recognition!
@MZHemingway Go Costa!
@CCARRanson Keep the heat on and keep  Tocic Rockwool out of here!
@RealSaavedra @dbongino Paid to protest? Crapola!
@UN_SPExperts @UN Hold these monster Saudis accountable. Sanction their asses. Worldwide, our great journalists are in danger!
@NBCNightlyNews @LesterHoltNBC The Munster is back!
@CNNPolitics She's laughing since shes gone-girl!
@ehuvos @CCARRanson @wvgazettemail Dumb ass, dump him!
@FLOTUS What was wrong with a normal sun hat, not the bwana pith?
@BethLaBellaFost @CCARRanson @jcdawv @Tom_Traver @postgreen Dump this idiot and disband the JCDA!
@JudgeJeanine @LaPetiteRobeMi Yuck!
@FoxNews @nikkihaley Sick of being a Trumpanzee!
@IvankaTrump @nikkihaley @UN @StateDept @realDonaldTrump One nice woman, Haley, and two dorks!
@foxandfriends Dumbass behavior. Hold the band director accountable!
@LindseyGrahamSC And you need to retire, bub.
@HuffPost And a sexual abuser, potentlally. We need more inquiries into all Kavanaugh's past behavior both in high school and college. End statutes of limitations on sex crimes.
@SteveKingIA And lock you out!
!Me gustan mis nietas hermosas Brianna y Michaela!
@nytimes Kinda creepy!
@foxandfriends You blew it. She was assaulted but didn't know which attacker was on top of her? Shame on you, senator!
@foxandfriends You did a great job, Senator Hirono!
@CillizzaCNN Sure, by wearing another "bwana" pith helmet. Almost as big a fail as here "could care less" attire. Needs diplomacy coaching.
"Foreign" language teachers make the world the better place! All students should learn a world language to acquaint them with other cultures. If only I had taken more French! Thank your child's world language teacher today!
It appears that  a courageous Saudi journalist has been murdered by the Saudis. Saudi Arabia imprisoned its women just for driving and just now finally permits them to vote. This violent backward regime needs to go. We need to protect our journalists worldwide. Repercussions now!
@SteveKingIA Think so? Tens of thousands of women ill die due to back alley abortions and unsafe illegal abortions will continue tragically.
@SenGillibrand Of course they do not.
@SarahPalinUSA Good. Why are you not spending your time fixing your dysfunctional family?
@edhenry @FoxNews Right. sue survivors those who claimed they are raped and assaulted. By any chance is your cousin your wife?
@newtgingrich And are and always will be a jerk!
Wonderful former supreme court justice, John Paul Stevens at 98 got it right about not supporting Brett Kavanaugh. Susan Collins and Joe Manchin, both  good senators and and fine human beings did not. The voters will remember.
The anti-Rockwool cyber bullies  in Jefferson County and "say no to Rockwool " sign thieves think they help their cause by their awful behavior.  What they are doing is galvanizing anti-Rockwool donors . I'm so impressed by my great Anti-Rockwool neighbors. Great people!
Toxic Rockwool Intl. is building a plant that will harm our families in Jefferson County, despite thousands who disagree. The Jefferson County Commission,  Ranson City Council, JCDA and the mayors should resign immediately. To be replaced by those who do the will of the people.
After watching NETFLIX Chappaquiddick where Ted Kennedy got away with leaving a  drowning girl underwater, became the "lion of the senate", Kavanaugh to be confirmed, Clarence Thomas on the court and a groper in chief in office, women and girls do not have a chance in the USA
@RepKevinBrady @WSJ @realDonaldTrump Are you really a representative and a lawyer? What kind of an ridiculous idea is that? Totally irresponsible.
@Sen_JoeManchin Do not support Toxic Rockwool !!
@megynkelly But nobody cares. And your show stinks.
@thehill Kavanaugh has done a damn good job of that for himself.
@politico Why?
@HuffPost The three of them should all wear pointy hats.
@DiamondandSilk You two are really men, right?
1600 Hispanic immigrant kids have been moved to a tent city in Tornillo, TX. No parents, no  teacher led schooling, nada! Shame on Trump!
@foxandfriends Soon they'll let them take bathroom breaks!
@foxandfriends Freak Show Manning
Bork got borked, Thomas got lynched and...Kavanaugh just got boofed!
@SebGorka @realDonaldTrump @foxandfriends @ainsleyearhardt @SteveDoocy @kilmeade @FoxNews @FoxNewsInsider @foxnewsvideo You are preposterous.
Trump has managed to insult yet another woman, Celia Vega. At least he didn't grope her. And he stated he "fell in love" with Kim Jung Un, a sadistic murderer. What is wrong with this picture? Dump Trump!
@dbongino You are a thug.
@LindseyGrahamSC And you are going to be in a nut house.
@ShannonBream Phonics
@SarahPalinUSA You need to concern yourself with your own dysfunctional family. Feinstein will not be intimidated. You made the worst example of a vice presidential candidate ever.
The Violence Against Women Act expires today. It needs to be reinstated. Why is it that it only backed by Democrats?
@WestVirginiaIWW I will try not to buy at Amazon!
@newtgingrich And you are a worthless individual.
@McAllisterDen You are dispicable
@GregGutfeldShow I like you but you are nuts
@ConnieHair @JeffFlake HA HA HA HA
@SpeakerRyan @RepGoodlatte @RepDougCollins @DarrellIssa @RepJerryNadler @repjoecrowley @senorrinhatch @HouseJudiciary @SenAlexander ...but Kavanaugh's life is over.
@PhilipRucker @costareports @AshleyRParker @juliemason Ugh, what?
@SebGorka Uh, his record, stupid.
@SarahPalinUSA Yup!
@newtgingrich @AndrewCMcCarthy ha ha ha ha too late!
@FoxNews Wonderful family!
@landers_ruby @FoxNews Despite being assaulted Dr. Ford FLEW in to testify against Brett Kavanaugh and speak eloquently before the senate and the world. Kavanaugh may make it to the supreme court but after his record of drunkenness, aggressiveness and possible sexual assault he will never recover.
@landers_ruby @FoxNews You would be too if some bastard attempted to rape, hold you down and cover your mouth in a room with a closed door.
@SebGorka @JeffFlake @FlakeforSenate Why are you such an asshole ? Flake has a heart and integrity unlike you.
@politico Female members of congress care more about securing a right wing  reactionary justice on the supreme court than they care about the lives of women and girls. They are  a throw-back to the nineteen fifties.
@dbongino I thank God you are not a Democrat too!
@LindseyGrahamSC Both he and Thomas are losers. The best Republicans could come up with? Now you are taking your lumps.
@SenGillibrand Keep visible and vocal! Great job!
@RepJoeKennedy I am 72 and remember all the Kennedys. You are the only one that I respect. I hope you have a long, successful political career ahead of you.
@SteveKingIA Boo-hoo! Now we can't bring up "old white men." AYSM?
@Sen_JoeManchin Finally! Just be sure you don't  vote yes to his candidacy. West Virginians and the country are watching to see which of our elected officials have guts and grit or at least wants to be re-elected. There are many candidates who can be a supreme ct. judge without all the baggage.
@GovMikeHuckabee Another dumb tweet. Flake has a heart and integrity.
Poor Jeff Flake got nailed  by one real angry woman protester in the senate elevator! How does it feel to be accosted, Senator Flake?
@mkraju And Kennedy is Darth Vader with  down homey witicisms!
@CCARRanson Ha
@GovMikeHuckabee Shame on you again, Huck.
@ananavarro Right, she didn't know who was harming her and laughing or who was standing by then jumping on her attacker!
@LindseyGrahamSC You made as ass of yourself yesterday! Cut out the grand standing!
@maziehirono @SenKamalaHarris Keep up the great work, Senator Hirono! Thank you!
Brett Kavanaugh is a  pathetic disaster. First, this loser admits he was "incel" in high school, college and beyond. A beer drunk, he "partied" with Mark Judge, a degenerate. We are supposed to believe he did not attempt to assault Dr. Blasey Ford?
@StephenKing yup, it's a horrorshow....
@JudgeJeanine @landers_ruby Pirro is no judge.
@thedailybanter Watta shock!
@HeyTammyBruce She does not want her and her family shreadded, dummie!
@peterbakernyt Calendars from 1982, yeah right!
@PolitiBunny I feel sorry for you.
@CCARRanson You women rock!
@FoxFriendsFirst She is the best.
@maziehirono Yup they will.
@BretBaier Of course they say that, they want no part of a situation where they and their families, as the survivor, will be harassed and threatened and forced to leave their homes, jerk. Under oath they would have a harder time perjuring themselves!
@megynkelly What the hell are you talking about airhead?
@TheRickWilson Will one pill  do it?
@shearm @nytimes Deport Milania's parents!
@dbongino You re wacked Bongi boy!
@NBCPolitics How Trumplike!
@FoxNews Brave woman! I believe her and expect her to do very well.
@annakooiman @FoxNews @foxandfriends @ffweekend @edhenry @PeteHegseth yuck
@BetoORourke Good luck Beto against that Munster creep, Cruz.
@GovMikeHuckabee She has at least one witness who may have been a participant, with a drunken past in high school.
@nytimes French idiots!
@SenWarren @realDonaldTrump That is not what victims do. They hide.
@robreiner Isn't Trump repulsive. Admitted he is a serial abuser. And people voted for this animal.
@GovMikeHuckabee I will vote for Booker. How can you, a Christian, support a reprobate like Trump?
Brett Kavanaugh just got a ringing endorsement from...Roy Moore!  Hahahaha!
Trump will meet with Crown prince Salman of corrupt, backward Saudi Arabia. Will Trump bring up the trying of a female Saudi activist for non-violent protest of the appallng women's human rights record? I doubt it, especially with Trump's horrible record with women. Dump Trump!
Saudi prosecutors are -- horrifyingly -- seeking the death penalty for a nonviolent woman protester seeking improved women's rights in this backward sickening corrupt Islamist regime. Are the Saudi's receiving USA dollars? If so time to cut off  the Saudis now!
So... now our great American heroes who bravely gave their lives for freedom at the Alamo are not heroes according to Senator Ted Cruz? Really Ted? Deport this Munster cartoon!
@historylvrsclub Ha, ha, ha! They should have all donated him some blood!
@FoxFriendsFirst Of course not.
@SenAlexander Wrong!
@CCARRanson @EPA @LTMnews @350Loudoun No shit Sherlock!
@CCARRanson @TheJournalWV Whaa?!
@CCARRanson This one best not slip by!
@CCARRanson Dump and replace the whole lot of them at the voting booth!
@CCARRanson @DEPWV @TheJournalWV Useless!
@CCARRanson The Spirit of Jefferson needs to STOP giving Bjorn Rici Anderson almost a whole page to spread his lies.
@CCARRanson @jcdawv Wonderful group of dedicated, informed, fun neighbors! Proud of y'all!
@CCARRanson We need to vote the whole lot of them out of office. Walmart needs workers. "Spill on aisle two.!
Our elected officials in Ranson and Charles Town WV are ALL on notice that we will vote them out of office if they continue to support Toxic Rockwool!
Reunite the Hispanic immigrant children to their heartbroken parents now. A national disgrace since the Obama administration.
The anti-Toxic Rockwool movement is rapidly growing in momentum  and strength. I am so proud of the many protesting Jefferson County residents. We will triumph over Toxic Rockwool!
Texas is eliminating the first woman presidential candidate, former secretary of state and NY senator  -- Hillary Clinton from compulsory mention in its curriculum. Congratulations to the great state of Texas that ranks 47 out of 50 in education. Yeehaw!
@GovMikeHuckabee Your comments are always as ridiculous as your daughter's are.
@NBCPolitics And Hatch is a Mormon. Didn't they once have numerous wives?
@davidfrum Yes and a seventeen year old is hardly a minor. That is a senior in high school.
@PattyMurray We were all outraged.
@GovMikeHuckabee You are actually suggesting that the allegations are not true? This is another ploy to stop victims of sexual abuse from speaking up against their violators. As usual, Huckabee, you are 100 years behind the times. Shameful platitudes "We all agree consequences are demanded..."
This is a tweet i sent to Lars Gert Lose the Danish ambassador to the USA. Please tweet him too. He needs to see a flood of tweets! Say NO to Toxic Rockwool! https://t.co/UKZ6T8eZae
@Upson4WV @reno_patty @Jcda You are so wrong!
it is of the utmost importance that the toxic polluting Danish corporation Roxwool does not build it's poison-spewing plant in beautiful Ranson, WV in the USA. Our ill-informed local governments invited this monster here and the result has been overwhelming rage. Help stop this!
Jefferson County is uniting to fight toxic Rockwool from building it's poisonous polluting plant here! I sent my $50 contribution to Jefferson Vision to support our legal efforts to keep this monster out. Support our childrens' health and safety.
@TheFive You certainly are an idiotic creep. Listen to your mother, jerk.
@NRATV @dbongino You are a jerk.
@Pontifex Stop defending pedophile defending bishops. Contemplate that.
@ThBlackSquirrel @reno_patty @jcdawv @rockwoolna @JeffCoWV Casto needs to be gone!
@Upson4WV @reno_patty @Jcda Jill, earlier you came to my door and I told you that I would vote for you even though I am a democrat. You have endorsed a toxic corporation that will harm our kids.  Denmark will not permit them to build more there.I will do all I can to vote you OUT of office. Shameful!
@reno_patty @Sen_JoeManchin @1o5CleanEnergy @CCARRanson Very good Patty!
Again, today Trump blamed the last hurricane tragedy in Puerto Rico on Puerto Ricans. And he shamefully claimed heroic efforts to help. Shocking. Maybe Trump will come down after this year's storm and throw more paper towels at suffering residents.
@CurtisIngraham1 @FoxNews @Hadas_Gold You are wise and brave to call out cruel Laura Ingraham. Her shockingly wicked comments to David Hogg will haunt her. Horrible behavior at college outing gays. She wears a cross? Perhaps she will spend eternity in hell in a  detention cage,  umm... summer camp.
@LynnThurber Contemptible. Where were you raised?
@LynnThurber Because you obviously are a bigot.
@LynnThurber OBAMASS? Didn't I leave you back in fourth grade? Somebody should have.
@LynnThurber You debase yourself.
@LynnThurber That is a paranoid wack job tweet.
@LynnThurber Another dumb disgusting tweet. Shameful.
@LynnThurber Repulsive, shameful  tweet. Typical hateful Trumpster. Despiciable!
@mjz4043 Unlikely, however they prefer young, stupid teachers easily manipulated by mediocre administrators, poor parents and dummies like you who troll Twitter. A bright, informed 71 yo. EdD is intimidating to small minds. Age discrimination is illegal. I don't hide my identity mjz4043
Trump actually has the audacity to announce that his administrations response to a devastated Puerto Rico after hurricane Florence was heroic? Day after day one more outrage after another!
How many Hispanic illegal immigrant children are still detained and separated from their parents?
God bless America and swift death to her enemies! Let's all remember the brave fire fighters, cops and all the first responders who ran into the fire to save others on 9/11/01!
@horto_lanc Milania for tolerating him.
@LynnThurber And courageous Megan was right.
@LynnThurber Sick, sick, sick!
@LynnThurber Another Trumpster idiot spewing hate to truth!
@stu_fraser Fire him.
Carlos Ramos should never umpire another tennis match again. Fire him. Professional Tennis must stop discriminating against women now.
@TLinfesty Go Tyler Plaid!
Serena Williams lost a US Open after the blatantly biased, sexist call by a chair linesman. Again, professional tennis is openly biased against women! The only ones smiling are Osaka and the little linesman Serena berated and abused after her footfall call years earlier.
@usopen @Naomi_Osaka_ She has shot off her mouth before.
@SenKamalaHarris Stop this dangerous man!
Courageous Miss West Virginia Madaline Collins criticized Trump for his causing division in the USA. She knew her comments would cost her. Go pretty Madaline, a proud West Virginian!
Yesterday an insane neighbor chainsawed down a perfect, healthy 15ft. maple in her front yard, despite strong HOA prohibitions. I approached her politely and asked why and she flew into a irrational rage. I alerted the HOA to fine her sorry ass and insure she replaces the maple.
The despicable trio, Betsy DeVos and the Koch brothers are trying to defund public education and direct public school funds to private schools. This is being challenged by a few brave women in Arizona. Trump's national shame!
I am an active,enthusiastic, smart, motivated over-educated prospective teacher (K-12) and I just had two idiot principals refuse to interview me simply because they presume I am over the hill. Why is age discrimination not as bad as gender or color? Unjust!
Jefferson County WV commissioners and city councils have irresponsibly voted to permit the toxic polluter, Rockwool to build its dangerous plant and huge chimneys to spew out chemical pollution over our beautiful farmland. I plan to run for a seat on the Ranson City Council!
The detained Hispanic immigrant children and their parents may now look forward to a permanent detention? What has become of the United States of America? Make America Great Again by dumping Trump!
@Sen_JoeManchin Better that a fair and thorough examination, give Kavanaugh the boot!!
@SenCapito Please be SURE to vote against the Supreme Court Candidate Kavanagh!
@Josh_Orange99 @Mallqueen01 @RealDeanCain @SharonLoeffler1 @TayaKyle You are so wrong. It's Tillman. And he was a great hero trying to reach out to a messed up vet.
As if Trump was not already insane, the NY Times Op Ed piece will make him completely irrational and even more dangerous as the leader of the free world. Trump will conduct a vicious wack a mole campaign to root out his critic. Who is minding the country? Milania, Maybe?
@GovMikeHuckabee They ll feed it to Sarah Sanders!
RT @CCARRanson: #JeffersonCountyWV fighting to protect our beautiful home from the pollutants that @rockwoolna would bring! #StopRockwool #…
Kavanaugh's hideous performance at his hearing, first touting himself as a father, introducing his children then REFUSING to shake  the  hand of a murdered Parkland student's father is all the evidence of this future justice'  character and compassion.
@GovMikeHuckabee @LindseyGrahamSC Sickening comments, Huckster
@GovMikeHuckabee Shame on you and your daughter
Brett Kavanaugh, trump's nominee for supreme court justice surely win but he should NOT. His dissent record on gun control, worker's rights, contraceptive access, LGTB rights is very bad. He will try to turn back the clock on women's rights, health care and God knows what else.
It is worth everything to watch Iustice Ruth Bader Ginsburg tell her heroic tale. Her's is a story for our daughters and granddaughters. Go RBG!
All of Charles Town Commissioners, City Council, Ranson City Council and mayors will be held accountable for permitting Rockwool to build 60 ft. smokestacks that will dump pollutants into our air, water and over our farmland! Jim Justice's days as governor are numbered over this.
All of Jefferson County is united against permitting the toxic polluter, Rockwool to build its factory containing two giant 60 foot smoke stacks poisoning our land, aquifer and AIR! Any government official including the Charles Town Commission,  Council, and the Ranson  Council!
A great meeting today at the Jefferson County Commission meeting room! So many concerned citizens eloquently expressing their opinions in opposition to toxic pollutin Rockwool. I was proud to be a resident of Ranson, WV in support  of our children and community.
Ninety-nine years ago today American women finally won their right to vote. It's time all women voted. It's also well over time to abolish the electoral college and make the USA truly democratic!
Once again Trump has shamed himself by refraining to call Patriot Senator John McCain a hero after his death. President Bone Spurs is a coward and a disgrace once again!
How many innocent Hispanic immigrant are still being cruelly detained? Release the children to their parents now!
Senator John McCain was an admittedly imperfect man but he was a courageous hero who withstood party criticism to do what was right. Rest in peace, big John!
Now Trump has cruelly exploited the murder of  lovely Molly Tibbetts, trying to compare her tragedy to justify his monstrous separation of Hispanic  immigrant children from their families at the southern border. Shameful!
Pope Francis has finally spoken out against Catholic priest child abuse. But what has he done to condemn complicit bishops? Furthermore, has Francis stopped  the church trying to bully victims AND end the  bizarre statute of limitations on predator prosecution.
Another Guiliani gem, Trump' smurf faced lawyer, just told Chuck Todd, "Truth is't truth." Bring back more Omarosa!
How many Hispanic immigrant children still have not been returned to their children?
Again we learn over 1000 children abused by Catholic priests and bishops. Time to bleed their funds dry and begin imprisoning bishops that look the other way.
Admiral McRaven told Trump to shove his security clearance since the Trumpster is weaponizing security clearances. Go patriot McRaven!
Three hundred news outlets condemn Trump's war on the mainstream media! Go for it! Dump Trump!
Now Trump is trying to take away his critic's security clearances. Dump Trump!
Dumbass Mario Cuomo of the Nation's most highly taxed state had the audacity to state  the USA was NEVER great. This jerk is a governor of the most difficult state to live in. Lose is the fall Cuomo!
With North Korea, Iran, the Russians and Chinese as real enemies to the USA our unhinged president chooses to devote presidential time to insult an  egotistical African former employee who can match him in viciousness and cunning. Way to go, Trump!
Netfilx movie War machine depicts military hero General Stanley Mc Chrystal, screwed by a Rolling Stone reporter and fired by Obama the wimp after Mc Chrystal referred (correctly)  to Obama as weak. Live long and proud General Mc Chrystal!!
How many Hispanic immigrant children are STILL separated from their parents and kept in USA shelters? This is an American disgrace!
GO OMAROSA GO!!!
Milania breaks with Trump over the LeBron controversy. Yay!  -- Free Milania!
Now QAnon is the latest right wing nut job obsession! More stupidity from Trump's wackos!
Ivanka is finally speaking out against family separation of Hispanic immigrant children, Trump's claims that reporters are the enemy of the people and climate change denial. Good work, Ivanka.
Trump won't let Milania view CNN  at her seat on Air Force One,  and he ordered her TV turned to fake news Fox News. Free Milania!
Trump is permitting Pebble Mining to destroy pristine Alaska shoreline! What's next?
Can you believe there are places where kids cannot set up a lemonade stand without the police coming out and FINING them? We actually are seeing Lemonade Laws to stop this madness!!
Trump plans to shrink our treasures, the Natural Monuments out west. Another outrage. And when will the many Hispanic migrant children be reunited with their parents?
Trump wants to delete the US government clearances of former intell officers? What does he have to hide?
My son will let me pay for dinner but he won't let me talk POLITICS at the table! Not fair!
Pro-energy Wheeler is being nominated for acting EAP director by Trump. Even a coal state resident knows that is putting a fox in the hen house. Dump Trump in 2020!
Trump actually agreed to  consider Putin's absurd suggestion to hand over American citizens to be interrogated by this monster and his henchman? And Trump wonders why his behavior has been considered treasonous. Not my president! Hillary's revenge!
Very aggressive Montenegro? Trump's latest laughable remark. And Putin is his pal. Sad for our great country, the USA!
President Obama, Keep speaking up about Trump's failings. If only you managed foreign policy better, Barack!!.....
Congratulations to the many Republican lawmakers standing with the Democrats, reacting to Trump's shameful performance yesterday in Finland!
@KappaPhiBetaSTJ I loved Kappa, joined in fall of 1969, all the beautiful, smart girls were there!
@realDonaldTrump Will you stop buddying up to that murderer Putin. Are you trying to make Russia great again? And what is the obsession with Hillary Clinton? You are making yourself look bad with your dumb tweets.
How many of the detained Hispanic children still have not been returned to their parents? A national shame!
John Mc Cain is a national treasure unlike president Trump. Keep up the strong tweets, Senator Mc Cain, our hero!
@SenCapito @PositivelyBrie Wrong again, Senator
@SenCapito Wrong, again!
@SenCapito @POTUS You are wrong.
The Trump administration is kicking army recruits out and deporting at least one after promising them citizenship --allegedly for so called security risks, which is shameful! Dump Trump in '20!
@IngrahamAngle @CNN @danabash @realDonaldTrump You are a disgrace, Ingrahm.
@realDonaldTrump Yes Obama started this but you, Mr. President are holding these children hostage. Please stop. The wall is a joke and never will pass.
@YHemlick @sacunning @KensingtonRoyal @meghanmdaily @RoyalFamily The aristocracy is a preposterous joke and an outrageous waste of Brit funds. Bye bye sixteenth century values!
@lucasluvpv @alclubb1967 @KensingtonRoyal @RoyalFamily Get stuffed Brit bore!
