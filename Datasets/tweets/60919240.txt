Here’s what I said in #Canada: 		After the last elections, America now has the most diverse House and Senate in our history. And heading into the next elections, the Democrats have by far the most diverse set of candidates ever.
This is unacceptable and wrong. We are better than this.		The ppl of #Minnesota voted for @IlhanMN to represent them in Washington. Agree to disagree. That civility. Anything else is simply another form of hate. https://t.co/YB1tBmWAAu
One of the things I talk about during my travels is the current state of affairs in Washington, DC.......And these days I can never take the stage without checking my phone to make sure it’s still standing.	 	Washington has become predictable in its unpredictability.
@hotdocs was amazing tonight here in Toronto. 		It’s always good to be addressing “Curious Minds.” Much of the time that I spend in Washington, DC is spent on addressing “Already Made Up Minds.”		Thank you #Canada. 		@globeandmail 	@HotDocsCinema

Today, I am spending time on the campus of the University of Southern Indiana. Over the weekend, I spent time with the upward bound and TRIO students at @utarlington.		And the Tarrant County branch of the @NAACP.
The #MLKHoliday says we truly value the principles of equality, freedom and justice for all that this nation has long espoused.		It says we truly value each other.		#MLKDay is a time we celebrate each other with dignity and respect.
And that makes it even more a cause for celebration, because we’re not just honoring Dr King’s legacy, but the ways in which that legacy lives on.		Today, rejoice. Believe we can overcome!
Today, some states in my beloved south will commemorate #MartinLutherKingJrDay in conjunction with Robert E Lee’s birthday. 		It wasn’t easy to bring the #MLKHoliday. Most of those who fought to make it a holiday are still with us now.
Thank you #MartinLutherKingJr for inspiring me as a child and Mrs Coretta Scott King for hiring me for one of the most important assignments in life.		May God bless your souls today and every day.		I love you and miss you.
“Yes, I am personally the victim of deferred dreams, of blasted hopes, but in spite of that I close today by saying I still have a dream, because, you know, you can’t give up in life.”		#MartinLutherKingJr 		From “A Christmas Sermon,” in 1967, at Ebenzer Baptist Church in Atlanta
“There comes a time when one must take a position that is neither safe nor politic...		Nor popular, but he (she) must do it because conscience tells him it is right.”		#MartinLutherKingJr
“Darkness cannot drive out darkness; only light can do that.		Hate cannot drive out hate; only love can do that.”		#MartinLutherKingJr
Today, we celebrate the life and legacy of a great American leader. Dr Martin Luther King, Jr was a father, a husband, a pastor, a theologian and a beacon of hope.		Let’s remember his dream, but also commit ourselves to service to humanity. His dream lives on in us.		#MLKDay2019

Knowing the ugly side of politics, I would rather be in the foxhole with #Bush41 than the Trump Party. 		Bush believed in public service &amp; giving back. He understood the value of those who volunteered to serve a greater cause.		Didn’t like his transformation to Southern politics
Despite the many differences with #Bush41, I can attest to his true grit &amp; character. He was discipline, stoic, tough and a great teacher in American politics and public service.		I salute George HW Bush’s service to our country. I am grateful he forgave me.		#CountryOverParty
As he got into Southern politics, #Bush41 was fiercely opposed to civil rights. He later moved away from opposing voting rights too.		I was there fighting against him rolling back the clock on civil rights.		Again, we all make mistakes. 		Bush was open to change. 		#RIPBush41
George H W Bush died at 94.	Shirley Chisholm would have turned 94.		They both believed in service. Public service. Serving their nation and believing in the goodness of ppl. President Obama went to see #Bush41 this week. 		#Honorable	#Humility	#Hope	#Honesty		American values.

The right of every eligible citizen to vote should never become a partisan issue. Voting is the lifeblood of our democracy. 		Stop erecting artificial barriers to voting, especially on college campuses. 		It is morally wrong and a shameful display of political cowardice.
#FridayFeeling: 		There’s plenty of Republicans who have worked to advance the cause of equal rights under the law, as well as civil rights and voting rights. 		Though they are not as visible as Mr Trump (a newcomer to the GOP), we cannot forget their sacrifices and leadership.

How will Democrats act if they win the Senate? The Republicans worst nightmare would be if they governed by always asking themselves “What would Mitch McConnell do?”
And because the Court rules on the law, you’ve effectively weaponized the law. And that would decrease respect for the Supreme Court, and reverence for the law.
And when you try to use it to advance partisan policy, you undermine both the Supreme Court and the law.	 	If the Supreme Court becomes a partisan tool, then it’s virtually a partisan weapon. And that puts everyone in danger.
I’ve been in politics most of my life. I know what we do. And it’s the last thing I want the Supreme Court to be doing.	 	The Supreme Court is NOT an instrument of policy. Its job is to interpret the law.
Brett Kavanaugh was chosen because he’s a partisan warrior, and he blatantly displayed that during his confirmation hearing. 		And then he complained when there was resistance to his nomination.		I simply cannot get over his threat..... “what goes around, comes around.”

There’s a reason that they’re called “justices.” And if they’re doing anyone’s bidding, then they’re not doing this country any good.		Why are we rushing to install anyone on the Supreme court? Unlike elected office, this is a lifetime appointment.
If a judge’s views make them unacceptable to a large slice of this country, then that judge lacks a fundamental qualification for the bench—a set of values that’s in touch with the vast majority of Americans.
The qualifications for a judge or a justice go beyond intellectual heft. They have to reflect the values that all Americans hold in common. The  best way to do that is to go back to picking judges that all Americans can support. 		We need judges who will look out for all of us.

Please do not speak for me. You can disagree, but I know what I stand for and what shall never stand in a democracy like ours. The right to vote is sacred. No matter if you are a pledged (majority) delegate or Unpledged (minority). We cannot change a perception problem this way. https://t.co/7FhzGg80C4
