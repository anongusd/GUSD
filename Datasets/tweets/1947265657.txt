I'll add: I'm young in D.C. terms on the comms scene - about 10 years - but I saw higher engagement from audiences on C-SPAN, Full Measure and NPR than I ever have Morning Joe or CNN or Fox. I can count on one hand # of times we've rescheduled those interviews.

Do you and don't let anyone make you feel guilty.		Bingeing Netflix? Great.	Haven't looked up from your book? Woo!	Sleeping a ton? Hope you've got great sheets?		Not shopping? More for me!
A reminder this Holiday to take care of yourself. 		Worry less about the email you're not checking, the paperwork you're not filling out, the calls you're not making. 		Live in the moment of your friends and family more. Enjoy your solitude if that's your thing.
To moms shopping for "Xbox headsets" and "the new call of duty" on THANKSGIVING DAY at Target...		You da real MVPs

Hey @comcast - I just got a phone call that the technician was at my apartment at 8:33am ET (It is now 8:34am ET).		Big problem: I'm literally sitting 10 feet from the door. Heard nothing. No phone call. No knock.
Go follow @erinruberry if you don't already, if only because she reminds me to pause, think, smile and try to put good out in the world every.
