@FreeTrade4All @GoldmanSachs R at least just my hope cause as I said if China takes full control I honestly believe that's when evil will engulf the whole world , literally ending the world, I mean it will be so bad so that's really when like Jesus will come back
@FreeTrade4All @GoldmanSachs You are right but I believe that has to and will change. The thought of Communist China becoming full supreme super power over all nations is terrifying we cannot allow it. I just believe the elites messed up with thinking the ppl will accept China as sp. Just my opinion

@GoldmanSachs China will not be a super power if if they ever do it will be the ending of the world, you can't give an evil communistis ppl n country power over the world. A communist evil dictator will probably bring the beast system n be the ending of the world
@GoldmanSachs No one likes the Chinese (well maybe evil people, communism is evil) so most people in the world will never ever ever look at China as world super power r trust China r want to do business with China. This plan will fail n if succeeds it will be end of the world
