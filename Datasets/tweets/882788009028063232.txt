@ThatMandyNicole There are many loving accepting Methodists who will love you no matter what, there are others who will not accept you.
Seeing this news about the UMC upholding a ban on LGBT ministers is truly heartbreaking. These are not the values that were taught to me by pastors. UMC can do much, much better than that.
@graveyjones5 @Luky_BB Free and fair debate is the only way to hear new ideas. I think each candidate is going to try to separate themselves with new ideas
@Gammera2000 @C0INCELPR0 Land of the free.
@graveyjones5 @Luky_BB Nice. Can‚Äôt wait to see him, I support Bernie but I really do like Yang. Considering giving him a dollar to help get to 60k
@krazgreinetz @SenhorRaposa It is tho
@AirpodRacing @Luky_BB Perez said two debates in one. Draw lots and get split up into 2 debates
@AirpodRacing @Luky_BB But that needs to be verified, but remember the debates stop at 20 candidates, so if tons of people run, then after the first or so debates then candidates will start dropping like flys.
@AirpodRacing @Luky_BB I read somewhere that polls also include polls from the first 4 states, if that is the case then he is at 3
@AirpodRacing @Luky_BB Thought it was 3 polls?
@AirpodRacing @Luky_BB What will trip him up is the number of candidates (max at 20) and polling. He has 2 polls where he is at 1% iirc.
@Luky_BB Good point, I have a spread sheet of candidates +donors and polling, once we can get some FEC fillings, the viability of candidates will be known
@Luky_BB Got a nuclear take here, but Yang is going to make the debates

@KimOlson4TxAg @KimsMom3 Are you running for senate 2020?
@GeoffMiami As a Texan, the energy and excitement around him is crazy. If he runs, he has a massive base and state behind him. Oh and addressing your point, Beto lost, but he made Texas competitive, because of him he helped flip many state and local seats. Get out of here with that garbage.

No. They may have won ND,MO, IN, and FL, but they should have been able to pick up Montana, West Virginia, and Ohio, while also holding Nevada and Arizona.

@TossupReport Who?
@TossupReport Even though he has some serious baggage, AG-elect Kieth Ellison will try to get RCV in Minnesota.
@TossupReport I absolutely love that system. Now here‚Äôs the question. Would you add 2 seats per district? Combine districts and have 2 reps? Have it like a senate? 2 reps in 2 classes running every 4 years but elections every 2?
@TossupReport How does Multi representative districts work?
@TossupReport Harris county at this point, is 7-5 dem to republican. The fact that there are 5 republicans and 4 Dems does not reflect our county. The 19th, 9th, and 29th, are all packed with Dems just to gerrymander them. While the other districts take out republican and formerly gop areas.
@TossupReport Pete Olsen takes in Fort Bend, Galveston, and Harris county.
@TossupReport I completely forgot about the 10th and 8th. Brady takes in like 5 precincts, and the 10th takes in quite a bit like 20 or so. If we are talking about technicalities, it is 5 republicans (2,8,10,22,36) and 4 Dems. (7,9,19,29,) Gerrymandering at its finest.
@TossupReport 4 Dems*
@TossupReport There are 3 Republicans: Brian Babin (36) and Poe soon to be Crenshaw (2). And Pete Olsen (22) 	There are Dems: Shiela Jackson Lee (18), Al Green (9), Gene Green soon to be Silvia Garcia (19), and John Culberson (R) soon to be Lizzie Pannill Fletcher (7).  Harris is massive!
