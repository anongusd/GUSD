Now you see what happens folks when you link your hardware to publically own property like phone numbers? Deleted accounts because of rotten customer service, due to a desire to control it all. You cant verify anything without @Apple @AppleSupport and an unlocked iphone. https://t.co/MddJaT2d2E
@AppleSupport Since I cannot merge apple IDs I guess I will just delete the extra ones and keep the first one I made. Then I can make sure to delete that first account when I am done.  Thanks for making things difficult.

@realDonaldTrump @foxandfriends I love how you talk about YOURSELF in the 3rd person.  It's because you know you have no idea what you are doing. Just resign and make a deal with the special council.
@LindseyGrahamSC @realDonaldTrump Honestly, who the fuck cares at this point.  When can you guys get this lunatic out of office?  The election was rigged by Trumps own admission and it appears he is suffering some mental disorder.
The national debt is more like, how much we value ourselves.  Debt is the wrong word.  It should be called National Investiment.  Which the debt is actually pretty low when you think about it, considering we buy most of our own bonds.
Should a public corporation be allowed to buy back it's own stocks?  How can the money get into other peoples hands.  It's a trick to keep their stock prices up.
Why does the stock market go up when we print money? Cause then there is more money to invest. There is not enough currency because the rich have the vast majority of it, and seem to think everyone else has enough.The corporations assets are locked up in stocks too. Such a puzzle
@SenSanders I agree. The value of the Americam dollar sucks, buy investing in ourselves and our allies, we can improve infrastructure and the currency. If 26 people have all the dollars, obviously there is not enough of them.  Get printing IMHO. National debt means nothing but to the rich.

@NYSE @carlquintanilla The average American REALLY REALLY needs their dollar to be worth more so we can invest.  Can you geniuses help with that?  By the time I can save I will be 60 years old.
@Nasdaq I really really need more wealth so I can invest and I have been working 26 years already starting with my paper route.  Can you guys help fix that?  So far only rich people can invest. I try to put more then 1 to 5 percent of my paycheck into my 401k and it's impossible.
