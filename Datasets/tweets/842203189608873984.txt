He speaks of the sacrilege of receiving the Eucharist unworthily.	In Revelation we see the a lot of Liturgical reference. 	Its all gloriously beautiful
@Jacob_R_C75 @BrianKBradley1 @iheartmindy @Cernovich It is also regarded as the Book of the Holy Spirit (unofficially)	In Acts we see how the Early Church was. 	Remember, the Bible didn’t fall from the sky. 	Acts shows how the Holy Spirit after Pentecost lead the early Church
@BrianKBradley1 @Jacob_R_C75 @iheartmindy @Cernovich Henry VIII to be exact 	Prior to his falling out he was a strong defender of the Church. 	He just wanted to marry whomever he pleased which resulted in a persecution and martyrdom of Catholics during that time.
@BrianKBradley1 @Jacob_R_C75 @iheartmindy @Cernovich King Henry founded the Anglican Church but many Anglicans are returning to Catholicism. A lot of dialogue has been happening over the Centuries. 	Luther &amp; Calvin very influential for protestantism	So although there are several break offs from the Church all are still welcome back
@Jacob_R_C75 @iheartmindy @Cernovich Matthew 16:18	The Church wasnt built by the Romans	Historically Romans tried wiping out the Early Christians- martyrdom	look at history	Early Christians celebrated the Eucharist, the Mass, as Jesus had commanded	Catholic means universal in greek	No Catholic Church=  no bible

A real man does not hit women or treat women like shit. A real man does not drop his balls either and let the world pull him one way or the other.	A real man is founded in virtue and is balanced. To give into pure emotions is childish.
That goes for all adults. We should all have that freedom to choose virtuous actions over emotional responses. Sadly there are a lot of soyboys who think yelling and name calling is the right thing to do. 	BS.
Some poor minded people think that to be a man you have to agree with whats everyone else says about you or society or morality even if you don’t personally agree with it.	Thats not being a man. That’s to be chained.	To be a man is to look past my emotions and do what is RIGHT

We cannot blame mental illness for every shooting nor should we blame immigrants for every crime in 🇺🇸	EVERY person has the potential to be GREAT. Sadly so many of us Americans are full of hate or pride that we fail to see the pain others go through. #Immigrants #mentalhealth
Mental health issues exist. Many crimes in America are done by criminals with mental illness.	Do other nations not have citizens with mental illness? #mentalhealth #mentalillness
