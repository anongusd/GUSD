Pa and ny have a single division of troops at  ft drum and maybe 1000 from dix on a good day.... and they are guarding the entire economy of the us while the us military plays golf in San Antonio and places like Venice Italy.
and we need perhaps three... so with Mr trumps order we have freed up 11 divisions.... and that's made a massive change folks... so yes we have already made a huge difference
Ok so the state of Texas has on the order of 14 divisions of us soldiers on the books and that's just what I know about.... Houston's a bit mysterious with NASA, etc near by..
I mean please can't a single division of us troops from central Texas hold out for four hours until they get reinforced against 500 James bonds from putins new hypersonic transport?
See IMHO the only reason we don't have a wall in Texas is that's the justification for ft bliss, ft hood, and Kelly afb..... With a wall the us army has to discuss mttrespond... See from Colorado Springs they hit Houston in an hour anyway... So literally the world has changed...

Do what do they do they don't want you to count in the same organization so they scramble the unit their in so we can't count how many they really have.... But I did last week using their own numbers.... 500k from ca to Texas.

Seriously since 1963 we've kept 20 divisions of us soldiers in warm weather waiting for the Cuban exiles to return from the bay of pigs to cause us a problem in Houston.
We've got 500k US troops on the southern border because we have no wall Nancy you dumb bitch.
Just buy Raytheon stock as that's all the Airforce buys.... They drop smart bombs so no us soldiers have to engage while America starves....

And Cisco well they only let you lab gear you can't afford and they haven't tested yet.... Then they ask you the max you can afford.... And give you a 99% discount.... One time which frosts juniper every time....
And yes I hate Verizon but Verizon cloud is better than I expected... And they will even let me visit it as long as I take Amtrak to culpepper of all fucking places... Seriously I had a datacenter in ashburn and I couldn't get near it and I parked my car a 100ft away
Fortunately Centurylink gets it... They build the lab but don't pay for you to get there... So you have to fuck the janitors daughter for the keys and a place to sleep
Wait that's dumb incompetent bitch just like Ms smith
And I assure you I have been doing this for 30 yrs Kathy and you are fucking crazy if you don't build images before buying anything you dumb bitch...

I think with Bullet drop, and the car facing downward from a front shooter, the shot to the windshield likely hit connally... which was the leg wound, and the other bullet was on the floor in the car.
the shrapnel taken out of connally was given to the FBI originally, but they didnt have JFKs body.
Parkland did not xray the body, and there were no bullets when AF1 hit the ground in Washington.... so I think the President's doctor took them all in Flight... And they decided to save the American Way... under duress.
But I think Connally was hit twice, and the president three times, which is five successful shots. One into the chrome is six, and a seventh which hit the street, and wounded a spectator. https://t.co/IxRBhrmpbz
and she was literally standing at the car. And she believed Greer fired his revolver several times. And so did Moorman....
what if there were no exit wounds in the JFK murder? In the Tippitt murder there were no exit wounds from pt blank with a .38. Then we have to say that there were two shots to the head, and one to the back, and a fourth single bullet in connally. Because thats what Jean Hill said

goes to movies... none of the ballistics match, cant prove anything, and weapons gone. Lee's rifle unfired, hulls dont match. Cant prove he committed any crime. Never pointed a rifle at the president.... just using my scope to check out the scene officer. Not a felony....
then walks into his own building from knoll in response to the alarm.. goes to the basement, takes off his uniform puts it in a box, and tapes it up. He then walks upstairs to the lunch room and has a sandwich. His brother gets onto the bus, and takes a taxi, and lee waits 5 min.

So here's my deal... I hold Mr trump accountable for his performance as CEO of the us businesses and the general health of the state... our businesses are losing money... and the tax reform resulted in less revenue not more ...while significantly increasing the military ..
See facebook is a very poor business platform... people post yearbook photos and chat once in awhile... But people aren't buying products on it...so a fake news attack on Facebook is a nearly worthless bet.
Stone wasn't smart enough to hack the dnc ... had to be Flynn...that was his job at the us military

But if they didn't take any action... But embarrass a girl who needed embarrassing... am I worried? Welllikelyyou didn't catch Flynn for what he really did, and he used up your prosecutorial discretion and he didn't even lose his pension.
Haven't/event
So if Hillary lost all of her donors confidential information, their credit card numbers, and her campaign plans as you are alluding shouldn't she and her IT staff go to jail? My guess is stone,ru and Flynn hacked the dnc just to prove she wasn't fit to be president... patriotic?
To get Mr trump impeached you have to prove that x votes switched his way... and it was a material impact to the presidential election... and you event stated a single thing except the dnc security was so bad all of its documents ended on Wikileaks?
Since 2000 we have doubled the us military spending and we aren't at war? And that excludes 200b for the veterans administration... 750 bases gone immediately please... https://t.co/i8nqatdINK
And worse you are accusing a nation of acts of war against the United states without proof to try to justify the doubling of the us military since 2009..for what? To kill a few ex Russian insurgents selling drugs in the Afghanistan mountains? And to bomb two thirds of the meast?
And I'm a democrat and I literally think both you and rosenstein should be arrested and shot on the South lawn for treasonous behavior.... you want to sue the president on issues before he was elected you have to wait until he leaves office ....imho... and shut your mouth until
They didn't have probable cause after the Russia probe completed and they don't have it now...so it's simply an illegal search an attempt to kill a person and his family through endless discovery... it's vexatious litigation Mr Schiff and it's a felony

Alrightallroses from here... pasadena here we come
What we need to do as Americans is ask the president for the state of union is also to present the us governments finances and explain while most us govt businesses lose money
See I believe the president of the United states needs to win for the american people to win... most of the time... we simply alternate economic theories depending on who wins... within 10 years we switch... so in your lifetime you might have 4 decades your side and 4 against...
And yes mexican citizens would in fact t subsidize the Wall with 4g/5g services from american companies .
See The bollard wall they are using now is really expensive... but it doesn't bother us.... it's just too expensive imho... it's a good standard... and Will last for 100 years... they just want to justify keeping 20k workers who they won't need if the Wall works... by deporting
We both did... we have the best plan and we won In 2012..,and the rest of this is smoke...
Ask Benjamin Torrance from DOJ if I spoke the truth... seriously call him and ask him if Mr trump told the truth?
But the Wall is a bit different...it's managed
That's right the us government has a Verizon federal bid on the table for the entire southern border inclusive of a second path in Mexico and 5g for 2.5b a year for 10 years.... with VZ sourcing Mexico from att  Mexico. Your two favorite US companies delivering Mr trumps plan.
This is not a fake emergency folks... it's a real one... and Mr Obama declared it one too... he simply didn't tee it up for the media... he did it on his own... why DT wants to litigate his own foreign policy makes no sense to me... he can't shut up... or let other leaders speak https://t.co/xpBEEI5L3F
Verizon bid 2.5b for 10 years... and DTs got the money so we want it as we won.
So Donald and I know scotus is literally next week and not two years from now...
Ok I gave you peaches and you gave us a baseline lawsuit... but I'm five years ahead folks as I have already sued Mr Obama and Mr trump and we are already there with Verizon who won this contest fair and square... five years ago.. and yes Mr Obama started		https://t.co/lQNWpFYQRZ
My answer is the Chinese have two and are working on adding one in s. America due to our pullout... and the Russians have about five outside of the ussr legacy footprint which was massive but mostly frozen and we don't want it....
And two more in Syria.... so I think they have four excluding their missiles sites in the Baltic states... and of course Sebastopol can spin up in about ten minutes... and that's. Pretty big war in the med I think..... for about 96 hours before one navy or the other is sank.
But I have it on good authority the Russians have one in Iran too... and most of the old Soviet states... so Wikipedia's wrong folks... the ruskies are still just about the old lines from ww2....

So Mueller who looks like he's going to die and Mr Biden need to get  together and play softball with Mr freeh and figure out how they are  going to pay their 22t debt....
The Russians and Chinese have less than 5 international bases... the us military 900 give or take a hundred.... let's count... the ruskies took over the usaf base in Vietnam... which we built to project power... the Chinese have 2... one in Sri Lanka... and one in Djibouti
But Hillary's 80 now and incompetent...Joe's 81 looking sharp.... but he wants to send us troops to get some new hookers for hunter... and his three wives...NOPE that's enough... Putin only operates on Russian soil as does China... we have nothing to fear from them
See Monica's smart, and she simply fucked the president of the United states and took him away from cruella...she gets a 9 in my book.
Monica Lewinsky is the new hero as she did not create a redtube video of bills phallus and serviced someone who was deserving of our respect... now if he just dropped a bomb on Osama when he had an unarmed drone...
And we ask Roberts to resign too... in disgrace for not overturning us v knotts and burning down fisa as we don't want them... we want the chief judge from every district to be fucking required to carry a security clearance.... and the chief judges of every state which has nukes
So let's get rid of them... we don't want them anymore ... we vote them out of the union as all of their universities suck.
New England is minus 23T the rest of America is plus 1T
Okay I want to see if the first amendment still applies. America.., I'm done for tonight.... but yes he's literally the worst president in US history....
We need someone to blame for our debts so let's let mr dirschowitz defend Mr Obama as he faces beheading as I'm the fucking revolution mother fucker.
But only in Arkansas on the white water river...
Bill Clinton with a budget surplus should be getting laid for the rest of his life....
Illinois and Massachusetts share Mr Obama's debt and he's dead by next week I think...
And someone like the stodgy former gov of Massachusetts would never get a 2nd look...
Simply transfer the debt of every president to the state they come from is the law I pass... then their girlfriends will all come forward to kill them.
Let's cut off the weak branches.., Boston and ny need to go... and we are CFP
I'm giving the Kew-forest school the 5T balance
So let's look at the alumni of Harvard.... compared to their cross town marvels MIT... where do we start... Bush and Obama runs 15T in debt.... you lose.
Sucks
And George well he's about the dumbest guy I've ever seen take the podium....but..everyone liked him because... yes not a dick ... but all the Harvard grads who got elected ran up 11trillion or so in debt..so like Mr McConnell I think vigilante action is needed as that school....
I want to succeed from the union because Mr McConnell is so stupid he can't figure out how to balance a check book with 4 million employees to help him....
I believe it would need to be from a relatively rich state like texas, florida,ny, New Jersey or someone with a balanced budget... maybe Iowa, Delaware, Rhode island...
See the union fell on the 22nd of April 1790	https://t.co/eHkBuyQ4d5
Ok Donald ... make America great.... let Rick Perry give you the list of departments we don't need... see if he can spell them..
The path to the Whitehouse and the return of the United states would require a duly elected attorney General to light the federal government on fire under the 10th amendment... literally sue to block everything on 10th amendment grounds
But they need their purses back... and they have to argue over the assumption of Mr trumps debt.... and that means a state like Delaware has to sue.... and throw some congressmen in jail... but beau Biden was a pussy
That's asshole ... google wouldn't let me tell Mr trump he's a jerk.... see when the federal government is secondary to state government we are about right... then 52 governors get to tell the president he's an Ass. And he gets a correction as he needs one....
Why do I hate android? Spell check..
We've lost our way.. let's find Mr Washington and Mr Adams...as they were poor people seeking help from the big states like Virginia ...and texas and back then NY... and not some as whole like trump telling everyone what to do.. I'm going to leave no stone left standing tell then
And see the states will be free to raise rates as they have to take care of the sick, the elderly, the poor and the handicapped as they are still responsible to carry out federal law... so the bill of rights won.... and everything else becomes a think tank quasi funded or not
And I think I just saved us taxpayers about 2trillion dollars it think and restored our IT capacity... why because every state to implement federal law would have to modify 52 sets of systems with local vendors
And our budget well about 700b to federal taxpayers as everything else is self sustaining.... then we mandate the federal government has to contract to local government anything else it wants to do... or offer them right of first refusal in a fair market bid.
See federalism doesn't work... so we literally need to go back in time to about 1880 or so... we get the treasury department the military, the postal system, national parks, and state... we don't need federal police... we need state police who enforce both state and federal code.
But I prefer the Rick perry plan... And shut down the federal govt and transfer their work to the states... Then we can get our taxes where they belong with the states. https://t.co/nH0oBZJgyd

I don't believe the democrats can win a presidential election without labor... And the republicans have attacked that with free spending labor policies... Lowering business taxes hurt... The US but preserved the reds

the funny thing is DT that even if you shut down the US Military overseas... you wont get back what you just lost with the tax reductions.... https://t.co/6FjeiPDGjZ
Because in 1776, the government of the US wasnt just by the people for the people, it was by the people, and the states in a collected union against all comers, but the States were equal parties at the table..and now they sit back with their hands out for subsidies..
Do you think Thomas Jefferson would have run up a 1T debt? When the American Union was just forming?Because back then the states had to agreed to resolve the debt...with that kind of tension good decisions were going to be made..shouldnt the gov of MD be able to sue over US debt?
And I dont think you can run for president saying you are going to give away free stuff like College... without a way to pay... so Kampala.... you cant win with your naive positions... hun... so get your act together....

So I call on Mr. Mueller... to put some Congressmen in jail.... as they quite literally cant print money except in an emergency and we dont have one.... we dont have German submarines sitting in our ports, and no soldiers deployed abroad in large numbers... except in Germany

@realDonaldTrump Or you need to declare victory on jobs, and cut spending dramatically in other areas like the US Military, HUD, and DOEd which could be transferred to the states. Because you wrote checks you cant pay for... and it should be illegal.
@realDonaldTrump I think thats not fair... Mr. Obama did great on jobs and didnt raid the treasury to do it...

Its proactive police work and its illegal... all brought to you because of US v Knotts, the single worst ruling in the history of the United States by SCOTUS.
In places like Central Florida where there are only about 10 places to meet, and they have 2000 police officers... they literally send under-cover officers into churches, and restaurants, and interfere with every patron, raust bar tenders, and interfere with your personal life.
A local police officer with just his badge, and without a subpoena in most cases get all of your social media records, your apple images, and even your bank statements....  Its ridiculous.
It aint like LA law out there. Its a travesty... and its even hit Mr. Trump.
In most states local policeman file lawsuits on behalf of the state they live before the DA even sees them. In other words if a single local police officer hates you he can follow you up and down the street and file anything he wants over any period he wants today.
District Judges sign secret orders based on signed affidavits of officers who make 30K a year without a trial, and without witnesses being called. And they put them in their desks.... and you cant even find them unless they press charges....
Which is why we need to do two things: 1)We need to make sure that any application for special investigation has an independent defense counsel appointed to argue the reverse 2)We have to prevent peace officers from being able to speak directly to a district court without the DA.
And when you throw in a 50% divorce rate... we have conceeded all of American life to lawyers, and police officers including all of your assets for all of your life.... We have to have fault based divorce in every state as an option.
And where do we end..we end with unlimited prosecutions for any reason for any duration because there is absolutely no state law or Fed law to prevent it.And if you cross state boundaries for work or for any reason a Raleigh Detective can call a Norfolk Detective and start over
As although the FBI has 14 days to get a court order to proceed on an investigation... state courts do whatever they want for any duration..so if a Special Agent hits the wall with his case..he simply has to convice a local detective in any community of any size to take it local.

so when you get Adam to sign one of those documents, you have a court order you can appeal, and quash.... and quash they will.... as its out of the scope of the committee he works. https://t.co/HpBPzz1f7o
Or you can call Mr. Roberts.... and tell him he needs to take this issue up... as the Supreme Court can take your call on any issue you need a ruling.
Or Charge them with Treason... which they will likely respond with in the same against you.
And for the record you could sue Mr. Mueller in the 4th Circuit on the same grounds.... to get this to the Supreme Court in say four weeks. https://t.co/HpBPzz1f7o
And you dont need to do it in the District Court..Mr. Schiff represents a United States Organization, and you can sue him on original Jurisdiction in the US Court of Appeals in the 9th Circuit (which you criticize) under local rule 15.

Because I am pretty sure VMware is better too.... But they are owned by your competitor ..... But you own the source code now for KVM and used to have the best software company in the world.... And now... We are not sure anymore...That you can build something from scratch..lotus?
@IBMcloud And probably signed some stupid agreement which prevents you from competing.... Which put you under eventually...
@IBMcloud See what I mean you buy redhat and rather than build a premium KVM product you sell your competitor and put yourself out of business.......
IBM buys redhat... Then instead of marketing and fixing KVM they are selling VMware which is a competing virtualization technology...
And it works for a year or two... Until they cut their middle class workers by 40% like when bac bought countrywide...
What's going on is bad ceos like Ginni R and the Centurylink CEO are buying companies to hide bad earnings.... Which should result in automatic declines by the FCC....
Mergers which make no sense is what is destroying america... Like IBM buying NCs most important company Redhat
And att to give back bellsouth..... And Verizon to give us back yahoo which they don't like....
For example... Or wells to give back wachovia.... Or sears to give back Kmart.... And Amazon to give back whole foods.....
Which take away middle class jobs... And get bank of america and chase to give back bear Stearns lasalle bank and fleet
Well then we are blue collar competing against laborers in Asia who make pennies a day..And we are in a race to the bottom.. So I assure you the federal reserves model of low unemployment is not the goal.. We need to start antitrust fights and stop mergers like sprint and tmobile
And the question is let's say everyone gets a job and we have no unemployment.... But inflation is through the roof because the us starts defaulting on loans.... And everyone who is working is making minimum wage as we keep allowing big companies to buy medium sized cos...

Johnson had motive and opportunity and access to everyone of interest so I am pretty sure it was him.... And it would have required mr Hoover and a federal judge telling the doctors they needed to lie to the American people to save America from a severe setback.
But those four likely would have had to be tortured to get Johnson or bush or both.
So we count at least nine shots and we have four confessions in part or in whole by those we have confirmed were in the right places....
From the front we have at least four shots one to the front grill, one to the window which likely hit Connally again, and two more to the presidents head. The president also may have been shot in the throat with a flachette.
So if you find that bullet you have to find that Connally was by a different bullet which he confirmed and that meant two shooters from the rear... At least... And two missed one to the chrome of the car, and another which was found in dealy plaza(rnd1)
The navy doctor who inspected the back wound said it was shallow and it stopped him when probed.... But under X-ray no bullet was found... So someone removed it and likely the caliber didn't match
The congressional report attacked the ballistics findings and made the original findings wrong but inconclusive. At the end of the day the president was shot in the spine or near the spine first not second. Center of mass from 50-1000ft
Well the doctors in the JFK case were working without access to the zapruder film which combined with the autopsy is enough... To transfer the case to federal jurisdiction which is why the warren report was harmful..The FBI either blew it or choose to lie to their American people

And the US government doesn't even save 1 percent of its income which is why me McConnell should be prosecuted along with mr Ryan and mr bush and then it will stop.... So we need an independent ag
Which is the only empire which didn't pay for itself. US sales domestically are the entire revenue base for the United States...
Which is why I am democrat... the Republicans like their expensive global empire which brings no gold and treasure to the United States, as long as their sons and daughters are working there. We have the largest empire in the history of the world...
Because I believe we are getting to the point where every soldier who has ever taken arms against the US Military has passed to meet Charon
that being said we need to be probably in the Med(Sicily), Djibouti, probably in the Philippines, and probably in Bahrain/UAE forever... but otherwise... the boys(and girls) of the US Military need to come home...and we need 10K hardened state department employees everywhere else
Because I am pretty sure P&amp;G, IBM, Apple, and Microsoft dont need you to sell their products around the world as they have to local contacts to do business... so the US Military other than securing the worlds oceans has no business sitting in Europe, or Asia
Because Right now the US Military is hanging out in Nice Restaurants in Venice and Drinking Bear in Stuttgart.....	https://t.co/qIoMf9l4ZX		As they have for 75 years now....
not a deal with the EU, but seperate trade deals everywhere we operate... then we might be able to justify the expense of the US Military, but otherwise, bring all the boys home from WWII....
And DT... my point about a few cities and Colonies... these places could be literally seen as the United States... and in a place like Aviano Air Base, you could set up a city which literally trades directly with Italy, and directly with Germany... and in JP, and Korea, etc...
So I say we need to pretend we are French... get our costs down and have lots of sex instead of filing lawsuits, and sending US Troops into some desert which the American people have little or no care for.
The difference is palatable. There will be no hotel receipts, no rental car receipts, no forensic evidence... no photographs... just a smoking hotel with some chemical compounds we will do our best to trace. If a war broke out today.
And if you cross the northern or southern border illegally we dont..so when security professionals tell you this is a problem it certainly is..But RU isnt going to launch 1k missiles at us folks. They are going to get on a boat take a 30 min sail to CA, camp for a wk, and head s.
The difference is we tend to follow anyone and everyone who enters an embassy complex... which is why you should never go to washington if you can avoid it.... in an official capacity. Stick to Panda Bears.
And the reality is the G20 countries already have those teams inside their embassies...throughout the United States.... and it takes about three hours to get outside of Washington in a rental car.
So the point is I support a strong border wall because I believe the threat to the US which is the strongest is the most obvious..a team of Seal-Like quality simply riding across the border .... folks which have never spent any time in America and which would never appear on a WL
As the reality is the trials over the Marshall Islands they kill one in three maybe on a good day.... and it only takes one in the wrong spot....
Ya know I was watching clips of R.Reagan last night...and the man spent all his life working to denuclearize and all his life's work erased in one twitter moment from a dumbass..The US AF will tell you all they want they can shoot down all the missiles.... but it wont go that way

Well I am interested i n the Liverpool vs Bayern matches upcoming and PSG and the spurs... I thought Bayern was better than RM last year but lewandowski had a bad series... Bayern wins and PSG goes through...
But I admit if I put debruyne on the spurs and move to a 442 with sonny Kane I win just about every game too... Delle can play outside right.
Varane will play most of the time... In a five man rotation on D
Isco can sub for kroos when he sucks... Which is often... So 70/30
So it looks like this. Bale, and llorente/higuan....Marcelo, debruyne, modric, and kroos, casemiro and Ramos with nacho and carvajal and we win just about every game
And of course I am moving kroos outside to right...and putting Marcelo at left outside mid.... With nacho and carvajal....who are really really good players at outside backs.... So they play every imp game...
But I like to sub...and RM plays lots of bad teams where their second team gets enough looks...
I admit I want that job... Defense is near perfect... Solid midfield and one superior forward left. I'll tell the three amigos i am going to pay them lots and lots of money to get along... And bring debruyne and higuain....
OK I like llorente and Vasquez as the 2nd forward and I cut benezema.... As he's really not good RM... He's not even a starter on France not even in the top 20.... RM is still the best team.... With a few tweaks... But christiano was that good guys... The best forward in the gm
OK I like that... Sissoko leaves we take debruyne...and upgrade...
Now.... If that doesn't work I want chelsea to hire him whatever it costs.... Or the spurs with Ericson...are you kidding me?
But debuynes playing every game.... If I get him...
What's my problem.... Well I don't think even Phil Jackson could tell ramos he only got to play two out of three.... But varane and casemiro are pretty good..... I buy debruyne and try... And if it doesn't work I don't lose sleep... Sergio's superior but not necessary

And I am speaking of casemiro who is excellent but not quite good enough at center mid which is by far the hardest position to play well. And I've played them all over the years... Left back is hard too.... But center mid is the hardest...Except outside mid in a 442 on a bad team
Because I want the big Brazilian at stopper and not at cm where he is out matched by Barcelona. His skills are not good enough.... And you can never have enough good defensemen so I think you play two out of three games and be healthy rich and happy.
Fake news Mr trumpwe need to spread a rumor that debruyne is going to real Madrid....
And man city too... As they don't have any local boys on their team....
Yes I hate Barcelona like I hate the patriots....
Real Madrid deserves a superstar... And they need to beat the ear bighter and the whiner so they need debruyne.... To get back to even... So RM he's the guy... He's way better than neymar.... And with that Croatian guy... They never lose again...
But I have a dilemma because the red haired kid from Belgium needs to go to real Madrid where I want him... So I can watch again.... And man city had their one year in the lights for the first time in 100 yrs so let's go back to normal....

So personally I think a wall frees up 20k border employees to focus on the ,10m the 25m or however many mistakes Mr Obama and Mr bush added.....
And so is California and Chicago... As if they don't they pay for them anyway.... So they would rather they work and tax them...
So again like Mr trump the 10m all need to go... And their children.... Unless congress says they can stay as an individual or a family.... So a path forward like the senior senator from NY discusses is relevant as NY is issuing drivers licenses to these people
Point #2 if any of those 25m have military skills or the gumption they can walk right up to a major us military installation without being arrested.... Which is why the FBI is terrible and why the us military hates them.... And they hire their own to take care of their own
Including buying ar's down in FL or Texas... :)
Which means unless someone calls the dhs hotline with your favorite illegal they can most likely do anything which is free and available in america...
And they ain't on their lists... Yet
But I will say this for the FBI... If you are on their list for any reason..They will hurt you..And are very good..But only if you cross the wrong people. Former presidents, the founders families, billionaires etc.... But as DT said last week we have between 10m and 25m illegals
We literally are the worst in the developed world... So Mr Trumps absolutely right on that point and only that point..... But I am not a US senator and I can't convince them of my position quite yet... But I will try.
OK so I ran the numbers and each month 7m cars trucks and trains cross the southern border..... And we have 229k employees in DHS and that's not an emergency? It sure is as I have traveled extensively overseas and even in France I had the postal inspector eating breakfast with me

But in America there is a secret society we need to tear down and burn as herotics...And those are state and federal judges who sign surveillance orders against your home and property for any duration by any affidavit filed by someone who has never met you..And Ken said the same

Ok we lost to Chelsea my second favorite team and I am disappointed.
So waaaaallaaaaa we have 500 programming languages now..... of which perhaps 10 are relevant.... plus Google/Android which is becoming a domain in itself.
And once a CIS major gets done undergraduate work... and goes to the real world they are disappointed. They know their undergraduate years they spent was 99% wasted... and they want to fund some startup to build a new compiler and a new language variant which will take their pain
So I will tell you that life as a programmer is 95% SQL reports... perhaps mobile for a year or two, and then a web form or too.... So you need SAP Crystal, a web programming methodology, and a form construct.... (Thats Visual Studio)
but since you cant publish new material about this stuff its not exciting for a real university to teach you how important it is.... they dont even own the toolsets. But Joomla was an MIT construct and so perhaps I have to venture to Boston now.
And as it turns out University of South Carolina teaches literally the exact same courses. They teach C data structures and algorithms..which is helpful.... but not relevant when you get to a real company which simply wants you to validate database updates to a few forms all day
You have to learn new compilers new agile tools, new program methodologies which they take pride in changing for billions of dollars every five years just because.... The y2k problem 1000x over
So I spent about six years fighting with my alma matter who teach shit that's only free that no real companies use... So if you graduate from UofD and go to chase or Bank of America or gore or any real company you don't know how to spell your name....
So I think there is only one right answer in computer science....	Write your code is visual c++ and stick with visual studio and everything works until the end of time I think....
But if you buy 200k in hardware you love Microsoft again
The issue is this and I truly hate oracle... But MSSQL doesn't replicate without a 100 processor machine... It's a piece of shit.
And att is a 100% Java shop and 100% oracle.... And oracle is 100% indian
I assure you att operations have fallen to a foreign power.... Oracle who invests 95% of their training dollars on Indian computer scientists American universities can't even buy it ... They give everyone Postgres or MySQL now
Which leaves us Cisco or Verizon who still hires red	Blooded Americans... Att has 1000 Indian recruiters named jugdish who try to recruit for att in Atlanta and	Norfolk but they won't even talk to native americans
And centurylink who is junipers largest partner well they moved their NOC to the phillipenes and they barely speak English... And sprints is somewhere there too and just as bad
Cisco had 200 engineers on my old account more than juniper had in the United States.
Seriously juniper has about 100 se's in America and there are 50 states...
The issue is avaya and juniper can't spare a router anymore... And they are too proud to call ups, FedEx, or even Unisys to help.

So my advice to wells simply tell the Feds you will prosecute all that did and move on... It wasn't an organizational issue
Says he's sorry and he'll do better next week.... You had 100s of employees committing systematic fraud... But it didn't hurt customers
And chase is by far the best business bank.. But wells does more things like payroll... So truly the senator from Massachusetts is wrong and I believe should be prosecuted
As she was truly shocked I cared... And believe me I know.... I have had you all.... And wells is by far and I do mean by far the best at consumer banking
And dear bb&amp;t your customer accounting system doesn't work on the U... If you write any rules it creates double entries and doubles everything truly... And I sat there and showed my banker and she told me to call the hotline....
You don't need to get that feedback from Bill Gates in a customer forum at the four seasons in Phoenix mr horn.

correction doesnt need to exist outside legal points of entry... my apologies.
@RepSwalwell Well You must never have hung outside on Rt7 which is the frontier... where sons and daughters of US employees regularly go to soccer games with armed guards.
Because I believe when the wall is built Border Control doesnt need to exist, as it can be sourced.... which frees 20K employees to chase 11M illegal immigrants who need to go.
And would result in a 5.7B cut in DOD which has 450B too much...

probably appointed by Obama or Clinton gets to decide whether or not the little poll DT used to raise money or win a little county in PA, MI, or WI mattered...
Because I think if Mr. Trump is sued personally on issues outside of his office, there is a Question whether the United States has to defend him..and I dont think they do..First everyone at the polling company goes to jail for fraud, they provide their stats, and then a US judge
So I tell Donald to fire Mueller, and pardon his lawyer. Accuse him of Treason, and find someone else to sign the complaint. Then Mr. Mueller has to think hard of whether he wants to continue.
It is likely a Democratic Governor running for President might take a swipe at him on that ground.... so we are about 7 days from Cohen's testimony in Congress on this issue... and then well Mr. Trump is out of time.
The problem we have is Michael Cohen said he paid to RIG POLLS, and polls impact results...as they shape public opinion..so Mr. Cohen's testimony is going to be harmful..and yes the President should have pardoned him, as even if the Constitution was changed it was ex posto facto.
And neither could the incoming President....
28 USC 1442 does not apply because the issues happened before you were president... so in such a case the President could not pardon himself.
And I also believe since every state has election laws.... if anything in that area is ever proven, then it is possible to face criminal charges in every state you ran for president including fraud.... its like 50 felony counts brought in succession by every AG... AND
Otherwise I think cross-complaints against Mr. Mueller are possible. He cannot for an unlimited period of time seek to prosecute someone with malice which harms our perfect union. And I dont think WH lawyers are going to be nice.
I think our position is fairly straightforward on TrumpGate... If the President of the United States either personally received stolen DNC information which he used directly to win the Presidency,or if stolen DNC information was fed by his organization to the Russians then jail..

So my solution for Donald is simple. He has about three days to pass a one line bill making the US border the #1 priority for the US Military other than protecting the president himself. Because on Jan 3rd.... he has to deal with the cards he already dealt.
There is some question if such a question is even relevant until at which point the US Congress makes the protection of the US border the #1 priority for the US military.... and not for DHS.

Because I assure you they are there anyway.... And have been since at least the mid nineties..... So right now we have 50k border agents supported by about five full divisions of ground forces of different flavors and at least 20 major afbs.
IMHO DHS should be 100% focused on legal border crossing points... And the military, us army corps of engineers and the gsa maintain the rest of the border.....
For example someone like haliburton or verizon  federal would take a contract to maintain a fence for a fraction of what dhs spends today....
Net net the costs to protect us southern border get redistributed. So I am pretty sure donalds right but he needs to frame the argument differently to congress and he doesn't want to.. But at the end of the day we don't need the border patrol let's say 5 yrs out with a full wall
See when we build a wall... We won't need 50k border patrol agents.... Then perhaps half get reduced... And it pays for itself.... And additionally when there is a wall you can use the military to patrol it for real cheap... We might not need the border patrol at all except north

Because regardless of the President... the Military had at least three staff officers in the parade that THEY had to protect that day.... and that means there should have been counter sniper teams everywhere..... and thats not in the record. What my worse fear is they stood down.
As thats far more important than the Mueller investigation.IMHO.The largest piece of missing data is to know where the Secret Service support teams were, and what US Military protective teams were in the area.Thats not in the National Archives or in ANY documents produced so far.
Ya know I have been on the National Archive site for the JFK murder investigation, and the evidence collected by the Dallas Police was very poor. On a scale of 1 to 100 it was an 8. Nothing matches... and I really cannot believe that the SCOTUS doesnt order the case reopened..

Mr. Obama was not qualified to be president, and neither was/is his wife. But I am afraid she is going to run, and perhaps with Mr. Biden on her ticket again. I believe we will have all of the special interests covered.
The reason the Office of the President should get Congressional approval before deploying US Troops overseas is that they alone bear the burden of a prosecution of their decisions.... the American people never had this problem until George Jr. (George Sr was pretty responsible)
And for the record... before Mr. Trump the score was 4T in debt for Bush, 8T for Obama....and shouldnt they both be prosecuted... the ROI.... well we destroyed 1/2 of the middle east, and likely created 1M terrorists more than we killed. https://t.co/8kxNg2vNcj
@ChadTinney4 @thehill But obviously its hard to argue we are in a crisis as Mr. Obama faced... the issue for Obama is that Tarp worked..and returned a profit to American Tax payers.... but he still ran up 5T+ in debt.

What do you do when you bar tender is hotter than Wolfie's girl every night?
@ChadTinney4 @thehill I have indeed checked my facts Mr Obama is by far the biggest offender
We have to lower costs in America for Healthcare, and to do that the US Government has to control the negotiation on the exchanges along with the peers of all 50 state purchasing departments.... the GSA has to do its job.... its not today.
But I told Mr. Obama not to put the individual mandate in the law... and he didnt listen... and I am quite sure its gone... by lets say christmas next year... making it the top topic of the next election. again.... But that is a distraction... it was pork for the doctors...
So yes, I do believe the 5th Circuit will reverse the Ft. Worth decision, but only on the strike of that provision.... leading the Supreme Court with a likely vote to strike the individual mandate or the entire law.... so the Federal Trial Court did a nice job I think. https://t.co/a0aO3Js0x0
As chain apartments will not let you pre-pay them for lets say six months rent in cash. Which puts you simply into a standard credit process.
And BTW.... an Apartment complex from a major chain will not rent you an apartment unless you have clean credit and at least 2X the income required to sustain the lease. If you have any problem including legal ones at any time.... In America you are in a real crisis...
But do you strike the whole law, or just that one provision....? I think the latter is more likely.
then you just have to let the market do its job.... But essentially the Federal judge in Ft. Worth is absolutely right, and especially in Texas which has a constitutional provision which doesnt allow for someone to be in jail for debt, and HC could be a real debt...
For Example if I am a small business, I have to have payroll today to pay my workers...and I will simply have to either offer my own or someone else's products for Health care with the option to deduct that cost from one's pay. It doesnt cost anything..and will satisfy the need.
That being said, the individual mandate is illegal...what the US Government has to replace it...is simply to make American companies have to offer to all workers HC in some form.. then companies like Wells Fargo will provide business services to their banking customers.
And I assure you if they do they will never win another election.... which is why I am quite certain HC is here to stay.... DT needs to get better pricing on the exchanges.... as the Affordable HC act did nothing but set up a market economy for insurance pricing.... which helps.
So what I am saying is that any Republican who says they want to repeal Obamacare is essentially saying they want to cut wages for workers... because that what it means..but that makes their base only the upper middle class professionals, and the Top 1% of those with capital.
Furthermore in the current economy if you are not a Professional or a manager, you are effectively poor, and not even close to middle class, which is exactly what economists have been saying. We have to have anti-trust litigation to get our middle-class jobs back.
In Texas they declare anyone making under 24K indigent.... and what I am telling Congress that most Americans working hourly jobs are in fact indigent as individuals. They have to marry to have a better standard of living, or live in group homes.
And back to the labor question.... to keep things simple... lets say you are an hourly worker and get 30/hrs a week at 9.00 an an hour. Your income on a monthly basis is in the low $1000/s. And when apartments are $600.00-$800.00 a month.... you are barely alive.
because the cost for the US Government to provide HC to American workers in a larger pool should be far less than what it costs Verizon to do so for example for 300K workers.... even if VZ decides to self insure....
What makes me mad however is that I have worked for several very large companies, and the cost of my old Healthcare was significantly lower than whats available on the HC exchanges.... which means the States, and the US Government are doing absolutely nothing to negotiate.....
So if you repeal Obamacare you are effectively cutting worker compensation in very real terms.... and companies which have health care, lower wages because they do... as some workers have to have it.... the effect on the market is very real. Its a competitive issue.
Hillary lost because she did not have a labor policy, and left one of the planks of the Dem party behind..and DT well he talked that he was going to help the US worker but has in fact done nothing..remember health care is a compensation issue, remove HC you are lowering wages.
which is the very definition of treason.... so I for one believe that Mr. Mueller should be fired, and we move on.... as I assure you the Intelligence Agencies of the US Government do far worse on a global basis.... when you get down to it. Hillary lost because of Labor.
The European papers were covering European intel agencies monitoring the Russians in real time.... and they caught them.... but to pull that into an America court room is going to take years.... and it will seriously harm America..... for the press to continue to cover this...
There is no proof a single vote was changed because of the campaigns.... IMHO the only way the RUs could have helped the republicans win is if they provided the campaign "blueprint" from the dems to the republicans..there is some chatter that is what happened in the intel circle.
I am concerned about the disturbing twist that the media is now covering in social media..these sites should not be regulated..and the FBI's current investigation is forcing censorship for no reason..the Russians may have tried to interfere in cyberspace... but its hard to do.

And in the end some bitch who works for him decides what's on his/her calendar....
So I assure you congress.... You are missing at least three rules in federal court.... Which are very much required.... Otherwise you have to fax all your evidence to the judge assigned and hope he signs some sort of order which resembles your fax.... Or you have to have media
I asked her the best way to bypass her office... Her official answer was pay and pray.... but I assure you that doesn't work either.... They believe god has to grace you with his ring before you can get a hearing in federal court... And you have to kiss something

And then maybe... Then I am going to a party for another US district judge...
But I expect an answer and even offered to pay her for it since I have no business in her court... No conflicts.... One of the snake eaters talking to another.... She said no...
And I had only one question for her which she hasn't answered yet.... And had I been on Mr Roberts panel a few weeks back I would have asked.... Voldemort himself...
