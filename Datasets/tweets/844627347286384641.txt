Is it bad to look forward to this world getting completely desgroyed?		I can't wait.
@GregGutfeldShow It's called an overdose of opoids.  @ABC showed me how at just the right moment...before I discovered this bio implant and it's capabilities.
@Paula_White I already asked.  You sent me a very wordy and...lofty out loud prayer that seemed a violation of scripture to actually follow.		I pray specific and often several times a day to God,  theft of data packets via this bio implant keeps God from answering my prayer.		#witness
@thecjpearson @AOC Token is a moniker for someone used in the media to further an agenda.  Go ahead.  Used that known fact to attempt to further an agenda. Makes you look like am idiot.
@ArthurSchwartz @DonaldJTrumpJr Not surprising.  Seriously.
@Paula_White What percentage does this actually catch?  My prayers are always answered as no. Then again, stealing data packets through this bio implant forcefully keeps me from the presence of God No matter how often I ask forgiveness for theft.		Scripture refers to as "it".		Think about it.
The big contract, the US government and Boing....then Nikki Haley gets on the board.  		Plausibly deniable corruption or just a payoff to get her there?
@NBCNews Establishing the precedent of law enforcement searching phone records to "prove" they were on the phone at that moment.		They have been trying to get access to your phone without having to ask for a long time.		This is how.
@jdickerson You can read about Babylon in Revelations and the useful hour.		This kind of helps me remember that scripture and how this appear to...lead up to it.
@MostRadicalMan Of course.  It's part of the earth that will get destroyed when God creates the new heaven and new earth.  		:)
@NBCNews Read the first commandment.
@potus @SecPompeo 		Widows and orphans...		You know where you can read about it.
@TomiLahren Good thing you aren't God, who DOES forgive.
@ABC You spelled 'sin' wrong.
@amanda51381 @NBCNews ...goes to hell and the forgiven molester is to heaven.  What we do or don't do does not get us to heaven, but whether or not we believe and are forgiven is how we will get to heaven.
@amanda51381 @NBCNews ...assign a hierarchy of severity to sin to make oneself feel better about their own sinful actions and to make excuses why they choose not to believe Christ died for their sins, because "How could an abuser just be forgiven...?"  Won't they be surprised when the do gooder goes..
@amanda51381 @NBCNews They are both "sins of the flesh".  God also says that looking at your neighbors wife lustfully, one has already committed adultery. 		Technically, looking at your neighbors wife lustfully is the same as any sin of the flesh according to God's word.  It is people who assign...
@amanda51381 @NBCNews What scripture backs up your feel?
@Comey The truth is, bio medical implants are rape.  Theft of data packets via those implants are forced sin against God.  		Were you talking about that truth?
@NBCNews How about zero tolerance on  ALL sin?  Such as homosexuality? And pre marital sex?  And theft? All sin is the same in God's eyes.
@MostRadicalMan Yes. As long as there are biomedical implants that transmit audio and visual and emotions ets, Satan, who can unwell some, will know what this thoughts are.		I just imagine how awesome it will be when he is thrown into the abyss and the world is obliterated.		They don't lile that
@BlazeTV @MillerStream @theblaze @aaronscolen How about a history month for each of the tribes of Israel?
@mchooyah ...puppeteering most around a person.  And they don't even know what they are doing.
Valentine's day is a holiday that enables sin, unless you're married.
@SheriffClarke That raping is no different than any sin you have committed in God's eyes.  He hates murder more than the rest though.
@vnbateman Well, God DID cloth Adam and Eve in skin after they sinned, so.....
@mitchellvii Democrats voice out and act out things directly opposed to scripture, together with reverse setting arguments targeted at those who believe in God.		Evildoers.  Not evil.  There's a difference.		They need God too.
@AmerMedicalAssn 	@DeptVetAffairs 	@WHO 	#mercymedicalcenter
This triangle just behind my ear is just a material to conduct sound.  The conduction and serpentine antenna near my spinal column are specific to various body systems such as retinal, muscular etc when measure at a 1:1 scale.		Forcing me to disobey God.  Enjoy the abyss.
@dbongino Twofold.  They hate this country was founded on Godly principles and are used to leverage the bible against it, and most know what this country does to them and the lies that cover it up.
@benshapiro Women have kids based on financial decisions all the time.  And the libtards enable it by not taxing received child support, and not including that child support as income for welfare calculations.		#doubledipping
@HeatherChilders To bury your head there to what the implants really do to people?
@realDonaldTrump Once pacific power gets tried for murder, that will set a long overdue precedent that social media and other corporations will be subject to.		Too many suicides due to irresponsible social and other media.
@mchooyah It's a show to other countries.  You know this.  That why you are participating in the heavy redirection.
@MostRadicalMan I can't wait for Armageddon when I'm rejoicing in heaven because of the world getting what it deserves.
@IngrahamAngle It's a show of force that is portrayed in a different light to other countries citizens.  They needed an international media to do it.		The better question is why does US LE need to show that they descended upon one mixed up in this charade?
The book of Revelations.		What those have coming to them who don't repent.		You have to believe to go to heaven, you don't have to believe to go to hell.		You will be going to one or the other.
@bennyjohnson Who else in the world is seeing this and what story is being portrayed to them...?
@MattWalshBlog Well, these implants do transmit/receive emotions and other senses giving one a foreign feeling of, for example, someone about to walk in the room, a cop around the corner when your speeding etc.		Is it any wonder why the tech is protected?
@Paula_White Such as not stealing data packets via an implant, therefore forcing one to disobey God?		If a vast parts causes you to sin, it's better to cut it off.		#selfsurgery?
The bible is the playbook of the leftists.		They create parallel situations that to argue against would then be applied to argue against God's word.		@Franklin_Graham
@Paula_White Praying creates external cues for others who may be sleeping and causes dreams.		Come to think of it...so does thinking anything.
Love others as you love yourself.		I hate myself (thanks to you raping me with this implant)		It's God's command.
Useful hour from Revelations 18.		Very useful hour. https://t.co/tXHLTcDhdk
@realDonaldTrump She's using the talking point to describe the disgusting images forced into one retinal when you think of something good.  And to trigger you to be hateful. 		Those are the immoral walls she is talking about.
@DailyCaller 'Worst' to a non Christian is one who doesn't falter so they can't attack and point out flaws.		That's like me commenting on what it's like to be a singer.
@MSNBC I used pills when I had a handgun right next to me.  Pills.  Opoids.  Lots of them.
@KayaJones They already allow premarital sex and that is the same exact thing In God's eyes.  		You as a Christian should know this.
Your definition of family and my definition of family seem to be misaligned.  You got part of it right-the in law part, but you went further than that.  The judge is on time...		And yet one of the promises remain unfulfilled.  And I'm not talking about a wall.		Thinking.		@POTUS
@WHO 		Is it any coincidence that I attempted suicide after this was forced inside me at CHI Mercy Medical Center (the only hospital I have ever been admitted to), but before I discovered what it does?
@ABC The United States does not deserve to be a blessed nation.  		This is partly why.
@DestroyedJoint @MittRomney 		It's just another talking point to work in an agenda that is seen, heard and felt, but not in the way the masses think.  Just like most of them.
@MSNBC @HardballChris "Blink" the word I've been thinking about as this life that will soon be over and on to a better place where I will be rejoicing at the world's destruction for doing this to me.		Blink.  		Then it shows up in some public figures language.		God knows.
Are my data packets penetrating your daughter?	Does she like it?	Does she have to?		Why is it so difficult for you to admit this implant exists?  Is it so hard to acknowledge you forced a foreign object inside my body via my mouth (according to the patent of the antenna). #rape
@DestroyedJoint If these women really thought it was about equality, they would be asking the men to dinner and paying for it like we have done for years.
I have a sticky note on my bathroom mirror that says "data packets are physical" and see it when I shave in the morning. I often ask God forgiveness for stealing/raping with data packets.		@POTUS , God knows and we will all be judged.  You.  And me.
@DestroyedJoint It's a trap question
@DailyCaller She's asking for chauvinistic responses so women have a reason to further be a victim and make men look bad.		Just ignore her.
@MSNBC You are all to scared to have pence as the president.  He wont get impeached for that very reason.
@DailyCaller It is sin.  Just like common premarital sex.		In God's eyes, it's the same.		Why does society put a hierarchy on one sin versus the other again? 		Oh yeah, to lessen their own felt guilt in their blink of an eye life.  It will all be judged the same.
@CBSNews Media.  The tool of the @FBI to...encourage people to act erratically via elements and triggers.		Only there are harmful consequences.		Why do you think nobody is allowed to talk about it?
All sin is the same in God's eyes.  It is humans who emphasize one sin as worse than another because they don't want to admit they are sin ers-the first step in becoming a Christian.
I am sooooo looking forward to the tribulation, when I am in heaven.		Watching this world get their butts handed to them will bring me so much joy!
@NBCNews #abortion		Quit complaining there are fewer babies when you keep killing them. 		You can't have your cake and eat it too.
@mchooyah @th3j35t3r Funny how old vladdy participates the same way media, area, masons etc participate...
@mchooyah @th3j35t3r Brain to brain communication.
@realDonaldTrump "How am I gouing to get into Turkey?"		Just before the coup and before @CNN and @RT_com did their thing there.		Funding, in the form of religious giving, of Isis just south of there shortly before that.
@dbongino God says not to care about what others think of you.  Including history.  It will make the enjoyment of heaven that much better when the scoffers who didn't repent are being destroyed.  :)
@dbongino And the wheels keep on turning...making people voice out and act out opposite pairings of what they hear based upon another's visual and feeling thoughts.  In order.		They say the secret service knows all about that.		Is that accurate?
@realDonaldTrump They are going to have to admit to things that cannot be admitted to, in order to prove anything.		Mutually assured destruction.
@CNN This story will emphasize their cry as the southern border being racist.		It's how the media does it.
@NBCNews Did anyone else see that #metoo was a farce designed to demonize men?
@trish_regan @BuckSexton A pretty face get you places.
Data packets are physical.		"Thou shall not steal" -God		Do you have to like penetrating someone with data packets for it to be rape?		Tell me this implant isn't a sin against God.
@RepCummings You didn't tag the @POTUS in your tweet, yet you seemed to address him.  		Grandstanding much?
@SenWarren Unnecessary agencies unless you like a municipal corporation with their fingers in every aspect of your life.
@SamaritansPurse What if you hate yourself? What is God's command then?
@realDonaldTrump Does that mean they are just rumors of wars...?
Do you think a shape and hear an auditory response to what you just thought?		Do things you think and talk about end up in every public figure speech and pictures?		If this is familiar to you, please message me.
Do you see through other people's eyes?		Do you feel subliminal feelings you know originate elsewhere?		Do the phosphenes make shapes when you close your eyes?		Do you hear varying methods of auditory constantly?		Are you tired of "experts" covering and discrediting you?
@NBCNews God says that homosexuality and sex outside of marriage is immoral.		She's using that word wrong.
I can't wait until Armageddon.		Then this world will get what it deserves.		And I'll be rejoicing in heaven at the destruction of those who have done this to me.		And they will know it...for eternity.
@Pontifex @seanspicer Does Mary protect you or does God?		God is my savior.  Not a blessed woman.
Could it be that this technology is what the bible refers to as "it" when talking about the beast?		It certainly can transmit boils and confusion in addition to what I already know that it does.		@Franklin_Graham
This implant I was raped with prevent me from obeying God.		@mercymedicalcenter
Traveling.  Subliminal feel rape coming from another individual over data packet.  It's a sin.  God will avenge me 10 fold.		Enjoy eternity.  I have a feeling you all won't where you are going.
@VP @POTUS Surely the caravan had no bearing on negotiations...kind of like every other negotiation of @potus.
@KyleKashuv It's required viewing material for anyone going through diversion for a dui.  Just applied to school shootings.  It's legal when a government does it to us, but when a private citizen suggests it, then he/she is called crazy.		#WelcomeToAmerica
Don't the continents look like a puzzle to a smaller earth?
@CBSSunday @CBSNews Faulty explanations of what's really happening, yet cannot be acknowledged lest you be diagnosed with a mental disorder.
@greta Especially when you're a passenger in somone else's reality...in a "dream".  When you try and take control, it skips ahead.
@seanhannity Is he jealous of the attention to the wildfires rather than in Hollywood "help"?
@ABC *died
@ABC Jesus dies for your and my sins.  Even yours.
@ABC Meaning the liberal media causing real world harm again and putting their heads in the sand about it.
@ABC Women taking power and the frogs boiling in water let it happen because all they have to do is play the victim and make men look bad.
@NBCNews @NBCNewsBETTER Fear mongers
@ABC She's describing a sex scene from a movie.
@CBSNews *openly sinful
@ABC Telling of the Obama's friend and misdirection.
@NBCNews Hey!  Isn't there @SecretService movement there soon?  Oh, yeah!  Communication over open air waves when presidents and ex president travel using...'events'. 		False investigations or opportunity?		Shower the cops with medals publicly.  Watch their body language and learn.
@ABC Fear of what?  Imprisonment?
@ABC Why was @potus in north Carolina again with no candidates?  Why did one of these events happen when the @SecretService is moving him today?		Reminds me of when I witnessed @BarackObama secret service setting up traffic control BEFORE the 'school shooting in my town.		MO?
@CNN @CillizzaCNN *all of them
@MSNBC And you wonder why this country doesn't deserve to be blessed by God...		"Do not repay evil with evil" -God
@CBSEveningNews @CBSNews @jeffpeguescbs When will social media begin probable cause? 		 When the frogs die from the boiling water.
@FoxNews ...as yourself.
@CBSNews "Do not repay evil with evil"  -God
@NBCNews Faith that God will allow that to happen or faith in human decisions?
@NBCNews But why do that when they have plausible deniability by "attacking" a public figure after stalking a private person and using elements to cause harm?		Laws are different with what they can say about a public figure and a private person.		It's how they get around those laws.
@NBCNews The picture portrayed is not what the story is about.  It was the one addresses to brennan.  And never mailed.
@Comey You know what they say about those who hide behind women and children...and who is in charge of them?
@FoxNews Baiting the abortion crowd.
@ABC I'm pretty certain @CNN and RT feel the same way...after all, @CNN just got going during the coup over there....
@FoxNews @foxandfriends @jasoninthehouse @realDonaldTrump But curti g the value of their money prior to Turkey releasing him is, in fact, the way @potus negotiates.		Like with pharma.  Focusing on crazy pills I stead of opiates using the publicity of the shooting etc. Except that's only out of one pocket and back into the other.
@wisgop @realDonaldTrump @tammybaldwin @LeahVukmir I wonder where his "ideas" really came from...?It seems to be a very familiar playbook.  Almost as if I wrote about it years ago.  In term papers...in a college that has a "school shooting".		Just sayin'
@wisgop @BradSchimel @POTUS Warrents?  We don't need no stinking warrants!
@wisgop @BradSchimel And when the @POTUS 44 said that part of his job is the shape the no d's of America in the context of media...what do you think is really happening?
@wisgop @BradSchimel Every rape kit story is designed to make potential wrongdoers, whether they did it or not, feel like they ha e to walk into a police station and confess.  		Because it's "easier" when the media does their jobs for them.		Says my Criminal Investigations instructor.
@Paula_White Still praying for the miracle.  Everywhere my thoughts travel knows I have faith and believe.  They will see, hear and feel when He answers my prayer.
@jessical_oneill You married the right branch.  That's all I have to say about it.  :)
@jessical_oneill Your britches got pretty big when you married who you hide behind, huh?
@jessical_oneill You should teach your fellow mellinials your work ethic then.  Work ethics of a melinnial is a widely accepted generalization.
@EricTrump @washingtonpost What a pain in the neck.
I'm pretty convinced the @SecretService playbook or even agents, who once protected @BarackObama and now directly involved in protecting @FLOTUS.  		Signals.
@ericbolling There really isn't enough housing though.  Especially non government granted, yet still affordable rentals.
@FoxNews ...with the financial and other resources of the penny slot American people.
@FoxNews @Kerri_Kupec The nature of investigations are, in fact, fishing expiditions.
@Militarydotcom Yet they say to not shoot guns up in the air because they don't know where the bullets will land.
@FoxNews @TimTebow I guess he doesn't think the destination of heaven or hell is important enough then?
@realDonaldTrump @LindseyGrahamSC Not just when it came to @potus...they use the enormous resources at taxpayer expense to target anyone they see fit.
@FoxNews Who would want a woman who is weak minded enough to be scared away by a news story?  Not me.
@FoxNews @benshapiro Why don't they go after women (Sarah Sanders and others being the proxy victims) for what they really do?		Like the deceipt and misdirection of targets and theft and lies?
@FoxNews @RepMattGaetz The democrats won't impeach Trump because they will get pence.  He is hiding behind a more conservative so they wont.		It's how he was conditioned to think...and act.
@FoxNews @foxandfriends He's too overt to be the actual antichrist.  Just one of them.
@FoxNews @foxandfriends Whatever happened with that trumpkin who vouched Trump was a Christian?  Do all of his underlings lie for him?
@FoxNews @SecPompeo Something I wrote about in college.  Consistent with most everything else that is being discussed.
@FoxNews @SecPompeo Did Congress declare a war on trade?  Or is that just another excuse to skirt the constitution?
@FoxNews @CLewandowski_ @foxandfriends ...but in the right forum.  What America has done is an abomination to the justice system as it was intended.
This implant inside me is part of my body And it causes me to sin.  As a Christian man, I have committed to following scripture.		@AmerMedicalAssn https://t.co/escjaUKEXa
@FoxNews @FoxNewsOpinion But prescribing them poison will?
@GovMikeHuckabee @realDonaldTrump Because it's a tool of the @POTUS
@FoxNews @nikkihaley @POTUS It's as if I be seen that in writing before.  You know.  When you were searching for the source!
@FoxNews @LindseyGrahamSC @foxnewsnight He's hiding behind a more conservative VP so he won't get impeached.
@FoxNews I wonder how many of you are too AFRAID to admit what you really hear and see?
@FoxNews @seanhannity The word, "Trump can't fix a problem he caused" ring a bell that holds true to time.  		Fox is going to have to have him do more than run for office to correct the damage done...		Kronos....
https://t.co/ubUMAaCkHR
@seanhannity @SaraCarterDC I see what you did there.  God judges your actions, even if others may not see it.		My rejoicing in heaven?  Will be because you and your are burning in hell.		Enjoy eternity.
Ask @potus of he hears voices.  One direct question.  Watch the deflection.
@seanhannity @SaraCarterDC ...that time is protected...and used...by national security.
@seanhannity @SaraCarterDC After all...law enforcement DID admit, in college class, that they like the media, followed by "It's amazing how people just walk in and confess".  And the president is "responsible" for shaping the minds of American in a media context.		Doesn't take a genius to figure it out.
@mchooyah Or you could acknowledge what you hear instead of being afraid of the repercussions for saying that you hear what others do not...
@glennbeck @harari_yuval One feels, another sees, many hear, but they are still all rapists and theives.  Data packets are phisical.
@mchooyah It's only a sin of there is lust in your heart when one does fuck themself...think about it.
@glennbeck People should not be triggered by the voices they hear and are scared to admit they hear...triggered to think conditioned responses for the next lestener...
@mchooyah What if they are choking on it and would die if they did not?
@ianbremmer No, he can bring in the open how the houses communicate brain to brain.  But national security seems to depend on that not coming to loght.  And human rights could take a turn against America if they knew and didn't benefit from it.
And those who label others as psychologically Ill are liars in the most basic form of the word...and I will be rejoicing in heaven while they are burning in hell forever. @APA
All you who participate and are too chicken and afraid to admit you hear and follow orders of voices and visions will get what you deserve and those who use it to torture others...special place in hell doesn't even come close to describing where you are going....unless you repent
@realDonaldTrump Because libel laws don't cover brain to brain communication and books full of symbols.  The big lie by calling folks crazy when one talks plainly about it.  The actual cover up to protect the method.
@jessical_oneill Imagine, so another can voice it out?  I see what you did there.
@jessical_oneill Testing the limits of free speech with the threat of death?
@Scotttaylorva @dccc A trigger for one to read into their own house using a technology that can't be acknowledged but for human rights. @UN
@DonaldJTrumpJr I wonder of anyone in media play in futures....
@andrewklavan @glennbeck @nytimes "Feminist hero" is a prostitute?  One would habe thought a feminist hero is a virgin for life as much as they hate men.
@DonaldJTrumpJr Because it was about someone else's emails that he likely couldn't legally talk about openly.
@glennbeck By having a public voice to any who are networked to another, you are creating a reality.  Will you participate in the parallel stories, orderly cleansings, or about 33 other ways of torturous behavior?
Just another label on what is being done.  Cia, terrorist org., whatever talking point of the day.  It's all just calling the same thing, different names.		https://t.co/nY6xH84MIc
Admissible*  non admissable.
If I didn't know any better, I would say that orders, time, eye and the non affordable communicarion (brain to brain) is the anti Christ of scripture and being a part of it is like carrying the mark of the beast.
Time's war against men continues, I see.
@Paula_White You give false encouragement.
@KyleKashuv Another wall might contain sinful images to keep away the judgemental Christians.  Yet another might contain other things to keep certain sectors from even thinking about someone in any context.  Good or bad.
@KyleKashuv He's talking about a fear wall of time.  If you don't know what that means, you shouldn't be speaking about the point.  Different time walls make someone have visions of what the wall consist of when they think of someone.  A fear wall keeps one isolated.
@Franklin_Graham All sins of the flesh are equal in the eyes of the Lord.  What are there certain sins that children of God want to demonize above others?  Is that's God's will or theirs?
@Franklin_Graham Covering your neighbors wife is actually worse...
@realDonaldTrump @mattgaetz "Fake news" was coined after the content of the bloody campaign trail was identified through an FCC settlement under the Obama Admin.  Ordered content.  Just like Russia.  Ever get tired of covering for a process that only protects itself?
@greta As a side note...i noticed you lessened you anti NDA she the ND A was passes.  Sorry.  National Defense Authorization.  What are your politics again?
@greta Dripping and leaking are the only words a woman has to coerce a man using other things as plausibly deniable talking points.
@realDonaldTrump @TuckerCarlson Ran by his implant like a puppet.
@UN @UNHumanRights You say "defend the vulnerable...".  Does that also include the psychologically vulnerable?
Thank you for sacrificing your soul to hell for my eternal rejoicing at its damnation.  		Thank you.		You are forever a reason why there will be so much happiness where you won't be.		You don't have to believe it for it to happen to you.
@NickPonticello Because that's only half the speech that is free.  The other half is a punishable offense.
@KyleKashuv @nikkihaley She's a color puppet.

@realDonaldTrump @JudgeJeanine You know it to be he result of orderly echoes and mirrors.  The whistleblowers and investigators are the cover layers and the sheeple eat it up.
@Paula_White Still waiting for something to thank God for.  Words seem to be meaningless and even provocative.
@jamesdpitch @Franklin_Graham "Forgive them for they know not what they do..."
@jamesdpitch @Franklin_Graham A Christian stores up treasure in heaven when they are persecuted for their faith.  The context of "treasure" may be different for you.
@SonOfGodAndMan @Franklin_Graham Homophobic.  The bible says it's a sin, therefore it is a sin to support it.  Homophobic is a worldly view of how it should be.
@Edmo61645837 @Franklin_Graham Or is Trump doing part of the shouting?  He voices out like many do in the public eye.
@jamesdpitch @Franklin_Graham Probably not, but it appears that he just acquired a treasure in heaven due to the posters behavior.
@greta Orders and houses communicate in a way that cannot be acknowledged.  Media are voices bought and sold via these methods.  Why wouldn't they protect themselves?
@Paula_White And when you know your dreams are really a product of another's visual construct paired with even another's auditory cues, should you really follow them?
@dbongino @DonaldJTrumpJr It's all cover for voiced out house stuff that is not just another topic of discussion and way of voicing out other stuff.  Funny thing...i used to listed to Putin's live state of the state and the elections.  Saw my elements in it all...to blame me is to admit the process.
@SenTedCruz @senjudiciary Original meaning through the lens of today's biases is what you meant to say...but then again, how can one know another's thoughts?  I'll answer that.  Have an implant like mine.
@DanScavino Acting is not doing.  It's deceiving.
I question @POTUS faith.
@realDonaldTrump Have you nominated any judges without a daughter?
@UN @DPRK_News @japan @XHNews @KremlinRussia_E @hamas @DNC @GOP @SCOTUSblog @housebudgetGOP @Canada @nationnews @SaudiEmbassyUSA @IsraeliPM
@POTUS is stacking the supreme court with judges w/ daughter's for a reason.  Not a right or a left.  A too late corruption move while counting on the world to turn a blind eye to the actions of the president while demonizing a socially unaccepted, yet illegally illegal thing..
@Franklin_Graham @POTUS @realDonaldTrump @CNN Is it deceiving when using a public figure as a sounding board for a non public person?  How about boils and confusion over brain to brain comms?  Sound familiar pastor?
@Paula_White Helpmates.  Passion or marriage.  Eliminating passion opportunities isn't a solution to not having to abide by scripture. 		Subtle stumbling block.
@Paula_White Happiness shouldn't be withheld simply because a network can.
@Paula_White I guess that means I'll have to leave the area.
@greta Its called society.  I think the "curse" this one refers to is what is societal orders, houses and their heads' struggle to stay a voice and herd the cattle.  Saying what they have to say and using others' situations for that end.
@Paula_White Such as a wife.
@Paula_White He also promised to give what we pray for and have faith in Him for.
When you see a woman in a mini skirt knock on the door of a tractor trailer parked on the offramp of a freeway, what is the first thing that comes to mind?  Yep.  In a town of a population about 5,000.
@IvankaTrump @Franklin_Graham @realDonaldTrump @Pontifex @UN
Why do you think the other issue Ivanka Trump touts is "human trafficking"?  Smokescreening the incintive.
Saying human trafficking is this horrible prostitution thing is the smokescreen for what family court facilitates as women traffic their children away from father's and get money in doing so. 		The increased child tax credit is incentive that helps to increase human trafficking
Human trafficking is women taking children away from their fathers for child support and tax credits.  Child support the giver is taxed and the recipient is not (generally women).  		Smokescreening one hand (look at the horrible over here) while the other deceives.
@Franklin_Graham @JimCarrey @POTUS He watches eyes.
It's that time of year again when the suicide rates increase.		God knows.
@mchooyah Some would say that time is the cancer.
@mchooyah Leviticus 25.  Same.
@mchooyah Deuteronomy 15.  Again setting rules for freeing of servants in the old covenant. (New covenant being Jesus Christ in the New Testament as way to heaven instead of old laws and sacrifice)
@mchooyah Exodus 21 sets rules, in the old covenant, for indentured servitude.  Different than slavery.  Is the constituation pro crime?  Law set rules.  Doesn't mean for or against.
@mchooyah How is that needle eye?
@mchooyah Wrong.  Scripture is pro treating masters with respect in a slavery situation.
@Paula_White Prayer.  Faith.  Wait.  Countless witnesses throwing subconscious sin at Christians.  The treasures in heaven, after this blink of an eye life are simply gravy.  :)
@realDonaldTrump Think eternity.
@Paula_White It seems an entire "house" will see the result of my faith.
@Franklin_Graham @WHO How many suicides are caused by brain to brain communication and all the voiced/acted out stuff that goes along with it?  You could separate it into two groups.  Those who know the mechanism and those who dont.  Telling the truth gets you labeled as crazy.  God knows.
@StateDept @POTUS And if their dreams are a product of external (and internal...)cues?  What about the justice for those who are at the "table" constructing those dreams?
@Pontifex *on.  Does an order really know the will of God?  And does implied order worship their process before worshipping God?
@Comey imagine the psychological damage and operation like that does to US citizens.  Just like that.  What were you really looking for on that iphone?  5 eye tweetstorms leading to media manipulation perhaps?
@Comey ...in that very room where that kid "shot up" the class.  The cost of the new security guard coincidentally costed the same amount as tuition to Trump University.  That's about 4 times as wierd as anything else, isn't it?
@Comey The body language of the only Quantico trained detective at the UCC shooting tells all.  Especially after seeing Obama's traffic control set up before the shooting. @CIA 'whistleblower happened to oppose what I wrote for the 'killed' instructor.
Imagine a mechanism that could cause mass confusion and boils, deployed over various frequencies, such as bio implants.  "...in those days..." How do those induction coils feel now?  Do you have the mark already inside your head? https://t.co/AfCtwh0n5D
@KellyannePolls Michael Moore.  Julian Assange.  Hillary Clinton.  Minnesota.  You.
@KellyannePolls Libel escape by proxy terrorizing the private with public.  You have 3 ways of getting caught.
@Comey is the @FBI about ready to serve a #FISA warrant that will never see the light of day again?
@Comey and you are one of those 'signs'.
Something going on with @Apple , healthcare and LE rights to gain access to one's phone, together with apple encryption?  The signs are there that something is about to happen...
God knows what you have done.  Whose sin broke the ten commandments? Higher authority?  Thou shall have no other orders or God's before Him.
And yes, I know when you speak in opposition to another public figure that you are proxy referring to a private citizen...to avoid libel laws.
And yes, I travel all the houses.
@Comey
I heard it called "Time".  The ability to see shapes, with your eyes closed, that another sees somewhere else.
@RyanAFournier Comey is still trying to play the trigger/verify game that led to harm of a United States citizen.  Why do you think that bio implants that allow brain to brain communication cannot be acknowledged?  Intent leads to capital punishment.
@Pontifex Do those 'weapons' include bio implants that patients are raped with in your CHI hospitals?  Oh waot.  You can't even acknowledge those, can you?  Eye see you when you think of me and hear many things when I travel all the houses.
@mchooyah Silouhette.
@starsandstripes Out of the opoids pocket and into the "mental health" drug pocket of the same entities.  It's a negotiation and you are helping it along.
@Franklin_Graham Settled?  Is white as snow settled or is there a ledger of rights and wrongs that need to be balanced, in order to get to heaven?
@mchooyah If words are not wrong, why are people put in jail because of them? Or is it just assault words that offend certain snowflakes?
@elonmusk :)  The less expensive it is to launch and recover, the more likely to explore and populate beyond.
@mchooyah Invent it outside of the societal orders or it will turn out the same.
@seanhannity @edhenry Did congress authorize military action or is military action not considered an act of war?
@realDonaldTrump Those they screw over cannot afford to hire them to defend from the laws the lawyers are responsible for writing.  See the problem?
@SpeakerRyan Like tinder profiles who then direct to instagram and do subtle business over those?  Or are they immune because there are more lawyers representing them?
@realDonaldTrump Eternal price?
@Paula_White With this technology and those who worship it instead of God, pray 'umspoken'.God know before you even ask.  And the eyes only think they do.
@mchooyah There is value in something being wrong...
@Franklin_Graham The technology that orders use to control those in power.  Not the typical Internet or television that one thinks of as technology.  As clarification.
@Franklin_Graham This nation does not deserve God's blessing.  It is a nation who worships a technology that provides benefit and not God as scripture commands.
@starsandstripes I feel like this could have been live streamed....on youtube.
@DonaldJTrumpJr @USATODAY Did someone pack mule some coke in their vagina and the dems are doing what they do again without actually naming it?

@FoxNews @RandPaul Trump was always rumored to be a RINO...
@WhiteHouse You convince the population how bad it is to be addicted.  That population then turns to the addicted and conveys they are better than the addicted because of addiction.  Contributing to stigma.
@Paula_White For the unsaved, this is the best of eternity.  For the saved, eternity will only get better.
Killing the speakers wont do any good.  There will just be more who are voicing out for their "family" or "order" or "house".		The technology must end. 		It is how drones (those who give in) are controlled.		Of course its very existence is kept from the public. #slavery
It's gotten to the point that all I want to read is about war and destruction because 1, the media uses the trigger words that makes the trolls build upon and further harass and 2, the only thing that comforts me is the thought of the death of those who harass me.		@FBI 	#RedFlag
Cowards.		@FBI
Torturing someone over a cochlear and retinal causes more than psychological harm to the harassment victim.  		You know what to do with the frequencies to stop it.  But if you are under duress not to, due to the benefit it brings those who give in to it, it shows your character
The latest round of harassment came when I was attempting to search for a job at the employment office, while driving by myself.  Not what is referred to as "driving" via the cochlear		@POTUS 		Public Safety. Read the Constitution of the United States. That oath supercedes others

...of the method that is used to harass.  Either the government is doing this intentionally or the government is being coerced into doing it.  Either way, its not the United States that has control.		@FBI
Harassing indiduals via cochlear for not voicing out someone elses harrassment while trolling to force ones mind to a hateful place is how The United States of America does it.  Then they use public individuals to voice oit harassment buries in speeches and cover the existance...
@ChelseaClinton So when a man reads what you just wrote, who has a communications device that unwhittingly transmits to others, what exactly is your intent?
A public figure woman had a photograph on her IG, with a reflection of a pyramid on one of the eyes of her sunglasses with the word "her" in the background not long after I canged an old twitter account to the name "him".  This was during the presidential election cycle.
The press asks questions of public Individuals from subject matter of some of the filth over the cochlear.  "Free press" and "anonymous soirces" you say? Now pair that with what I have explained about what happens when time talks and constructs dreams. 		@FBI
@ALEC_states @TheDiscipulus Putting a band aid on your finger when you have Internal bleeding.
@instapundit Perceptions of blessings are like belly buttons.
@dbongino Hollywood ties, as I recall the late night show stacking when Obama was doing his thing.
@FoxNews @DLoesch @GovMalloyOffice @NRA Its a habit of some to use their kids as talking points for other, non relatives...such as how sororities and others refer to the next generation of stalkers.  How better to not get hit with the process than to hide behind kids?  I'm not anti NRA, I'm anti pharmaceutical.
When someone in science said, "we all dream together", it's as if they know the mechanism but refuse to acknowledge it.
I think to myself, "Ill just read revelations" then I hear, "I'll change(or take?) his focus"		This bio communications implant violates human rights.		@UN
If you cartle brand yourself with a triangle or eye tattoo, you then you will get what you deserve for what you do while hiding behind the plausible deniability of an implant for comms.		@POTUS
When someone remembers those dreams when triggered, it creates the false perception(and remembered images of those.constructs) that those things actually happened compounding the harassment and torture.	The construct happened in the 3am hour.	@POTUS	@FBI 	@DHSgov
The "table" that the eyes talk over, creating dreams that are not my own,waking me up at just before 4am,are completely evil and those who shape thise dreams should be killed where they stand. I've never participated in anything those dream constructs forced into me	@FBI 	@POTUS
@FoxNews @foxnewsnight He's blowing smoke up the assholes of the American citizens.
And I was audio recording while this happened.  Then read my tweet aloud before posting.		@FBI
So I think to myself, after reading something aboit divorce, nullify.  One female voice. In the downstairs apartment says in a giddy voice, "theres no chance for that".  Another woman says, "he married himself".
@DerrickOConno10 @barstoolsports  https://t.co/7njCnmDphQ
When I start to type something about the process of harassment that jas been forced upon me, more pointed name calling seems to happen.  I think their strength may be perceived in the way they harass being kept secret.
@barstoolsports Um.  Paying money to be sexually aroused is called prostitution.  Whether physically there or not.
@ClintonFdn @BillClinton Who do the C's hide behind?  (Retinal)
@UnfilteredSE @secupp @brianstelter @charlescwcooke Nope.
Are you going to take this implant oit of my neck and head now?		@FBI 	#MercyMedicalCenter
Recording audio causes them to use women and children as voices out.  Its been said that ISIS hides behind women and children.  The parallel for those behind the voicing out is isis?  Hmm...I remember part of a conversation about not having enough power...
@bethanyshondark @shannonrwatts Making men look bad to further your agenda.  Is that what a republican woman calls, 2 birds with one stone"?
Now being voiced out from that same speaker and also through the cochlear implant.		Remove the fucking implant.		@FBI 	@OregonGovBrown
So, I thought out some stuff through through speaker individual, and something else was voiced out from another thinker from the same speaker that came from the baby boomer generation that the speaker would not know the meaning of.  As im typing this, the typical harassment is...
I feel like removing this bio implant myself with a scapel.  Mental health is designed to protect the existence of the implant and to sell medication that is only a band aid. If I cut my own neck open where I feel the numb scar tissue, maybe Ill survive.		@FBI
No, I am not a hacker.
@NBA Will it take a virus if the frequency is hacked?  May one that causes boils?
It just occurred to me that there would be an advantage in being a landlord or ceo, as someone who is harrassed by everyone around them assisted by bio implant communications devices. , to evict or fire as needed due to the voicing out that goes on.
@ORStatePolice
@NBA @NBAonTNT And what is that specific wording supposed to start?
@NBA @trailblazers @nyknicks Would you be referring to anyone specific?  Maybe whoever is voicing something out just as this goes on the twitter feed?
The above happens in earshot while the cochlear is not as busy.  At least its not forcibly entered into the cochlear.  So there is that.
It sounds like the dominant troll on one side buys and sells with how they can trigger or not trigger one to think.  and of thinking of.getring professional help, one says, "you fucked up my sell" then more triggering and harassment ensues from another they are talking to.	@UN
Some of what has been going on, before I discovered the implant, contributed to an attempted suicide a few years ago.		No wonder it is not being acknowledged.		#MercyMedicalCenter	@FBI 	@Comey 	@HillaryClinton 	@POTUS 	@UN
Lete be clear.  This implant is a hindrance for me to practice my religion as my God instructs in scripture.		#MercyMedicalCenter
I may not pray often, as scripture says, but I don't limit myself to only praying during certain hours.
Why do folks only pray during certain hours?  Is it because of the varying entities that are listening in at different times for those who have cochlear and other types of implants?  I can only think of one religion that does that.
I select a movie and I jear the bame of the movie yelled over the cochlear.  I then moved it to another movie title and heard the same over the cochlear , "our mistake".
I think about, for example, someone from my past, and hook words from alleged stalking them, suddenly appear in the news media and other public reads.		Bio implants.		Acknowledge what you did to me.		#MercyMedicalCenter 	@FBI
All media, both liberal and conservative,  have staff workers who participate in the release of news articles that reverse feed.  The puppets who ppst the articles are feeding the "houses" with attempted triggers and subject matter to be used by those who harass over bio implants

@UN if you cannot acknowledge the human rights violations going on worldwide over bio communications implants(mine was put inside me without permission I.e. rape), then you are a chicken shit sell out and contributing to human rights violations.
What is a "screw jar"?  Something I heard over the implant.
Name calling.through the implant.  I speak (as I am alone)I must have struck a nerve because name calling ensued.(in thinking a out a specific cause of why). And another over the implant says, "thats bullshit!"
@Comey remember when you voiced out the san bernadino terrorist details when you finally retrieved the cell phone?  You know about the bio implant.  I did not back then when the ICU provided access to my phone.  I understand you are a "4"...Wall and read my twitter.	@FBI https://t.co/PCJjfOCWrv
@RepPeteKing Unless some. Virtually automatic system forces another to take an aoopsing view.  If one is disloyal, would that system then produce the opposite?
@Reuters Why?
@Paula_White What has happened is human atrocities via bio comms implant.  What is hoped(and prayed)for has been negotiated away by slander and coerced harassment, likely over similar type of bio implant.
@KimDotcom Your reverse messaging game is has been learned.  He did not do it!
@USATODAY Interesting suggestive wording.  Are you a womans rag two factoring a targeted demographic using a public figure to escape libel?
When they attempted to call the @FBI (over the cochlear) with my name, the response was "no join".  What is the conflict of interest there, even over the rape device? Or was ot just more of the same manipulation and falsehoods? @JudicialWatch
@KimDotcom @BillClinton @HillaryClinton The lesser of two evils is still evil.

The constant name calling.  Remembering that name calling.  The being preyed upon because of remem ering that name calling when the next predator "house" is on the bio implant.  Then they take it and compound it.		Fucking rape and torture @FBI
@EmmanuelMacron When a victim is tortured after victimization, that victim loses their morals.  Creating something far worse.
@EmmanuelMacron Why torture victims?  Because those claiming publicly to be victims are re victimizing the private victims via reversal up voicing out.  It appears to be fun for hollywood.
@RepDavidKustoff You mean pharmaceutical companies?

I close my eyes to see if there is retinal going on and hear over the cochlear, "we can flip him over"		Keep in mind, this bio implant was put inside my body without my permission. @FBI
"You just screwed up the table.  Thats the chairs fault(over the cochlear). (As I sit in my recliner)		@FBI
One of the woman harasserslocally just said something like, "its easy enough, well just use your daughter"		@FBI
Locally, reversed definitions of a positively sounding word that has been conditioned previously to mean something negative is hear.  Then laughing as if they think they are being clever.
Watching a live broadcast, voicing out in the background happens of the typical.  Then I take a break and hear voiced out harassment around me at my location claiming, "he messed up my good shot" suggesting a "shot" is some form of harassment to another.
Wow.  I replace the words im reading on the news.and other feeds, an I jear complaining.  The I get a nerve sting in my eyeball.		@FBI
@FBI
Who.paod for.this ad and what @Twitter algorithm stacked it at that exact momment?
https://t.co/blDZmjcPAV
Or maybe it was one of.the neighbors voicing ot oit.  they participate too.  Just like most everyone wherever I go.  I have audio recordings correlating the voicing out at many different locations.		@FBI
"Good jog" through the cochlear just as the television program shows a woman stabbing someone.throigh the eye.
When full color images are overlayed onto what one is looking at with their eyes open, it is still harassment.  And a safety issue when its done while moving.
An east coast accent through the cochlear...
When someone conditions a websters define word and reverses the meaning or redefines it by conditioning, then constantly refers to that word to.get your conditioned response to the retinal who is viewing you, that is clearly an intended action of pointed harassment and.confusion.
The voicing out says thay something is "settled" after a harassment action or voice out is performed.
@TIME Because the design to automatically take the opposing view automatically blockades and isolates you from yoir pursuit of happiness.  Ie. A beautiful woman as a wife.
The more harassment begins.  Two factored.  Name calling.  Suggestions. Voiced oit and over the cochlear.		I will think what is against the law to be said out loud.  To prove its me thinking, you have to admit you fucking raped me with this implant.		@FBI
Some say they are voicing our for their "families".  Some of the same harassment I hear over the bio implant.  I deliberately think out that some woman is a needle user and immediately some employee voices out, "not even close".  Likely false voice out, like the rest of it.
This bio implant is a pu lic safety issue.  Worse than texting while walking.  Harassment and torture 24/7 even when moving.		The United States does not protect its citizens.  They only take their rights away so it looks like they are protecting them.
Conversation heard via cochlear.
Dreams.  A building familiar to me.  An event familiar to someone else.  External cues from a conversation between two...entities while one sleeps?
Woke up in the middle of the night again as a passenger in someone elses eye in a situation I never wuld ja e approved of had I been conscience.  Then the audio scramble to change was heard. Then back asleep.  Its more than sibliminal hypnosis.  Its forced manupulation.
"Were jealous.  Whoopsee.  That screws off.  Liar.  Travelling.  Hopeful.  Travelling us.  Thats scr ews off.  Oh I do that.  Final whoops.  Hells yeah.  There he goes.  Way it goes. Dont feel it.  Good smoke. " via implant		@FBI @UN human rights Violations in the United States

@fbi I have pit in a complaint.  This bio technology will be made known despite the orders.  You think your covering the orders with the scandels are something.  Wait until the general public find out what this bio tech is used for and you documented failure to do anything.

How better to repay the loss of pharmaceutical customers of the opoid crisis, than to push mental health leading to other types of pharmaceutical customers.		Dont fear the NRA when its the pharmaceuticals that are the ones folks really fear.		Negotiating body counts.
Does "intelligence" work for or with the pharmaceuticals?
Ome day, "acting strange" will be illegal because of the press push to word it the way they do. https://t.co/gxND10WN7q
@AaronWorthing @DLoesch @ChrisLoesch Thats not the plausibly deniable way of doing it.  First parallel a private person with a puclic figure. Then piece by piece etch away woth suggestive statements.  Never completely calling for violence or harm.  Wait.  Thats what the media is used for.
Pharmaceuticals are the winners and the killers on many sides.  The more folks fear, the more healthcare prescribes.  Healthcare makes the customers for pharma and uses their "credibility" to say you are wrong.  Heres a prescription.  Pharma gets more customers.
@KimDotcom The thing is...the suggestion of your tweet is that the cover up is explained.  Not that it is part of it.
@Adam4d That's enough to make your head spin.
@KimDotcom @realDonaldTrump Throttle the "intelligence" aspect of all the agencies.
@DLoesch Its when the other eyes comment on everything as you look in the mirror that makes some think they should cover the mirrors instead of defending ones self.  So they get parallelled as vamps.
@KimDotcom  You realize you were used in the 2 factor harassment that reverses meanings in a listeners mind, right?  I suspected something was up after the comey visit, subsequent wrap up of your case and the ovama visit coming up.  Flushed.
@TheBabylonBee @AutumnDawnPrice Is ot the sorting and targeting of the content or the content itself that bothers you?  How about the hook phrases that naturally couple certain subjects together psychologically?
@CNN Flowers for dicks?  Seems fitting.
Wouldn't it be a conflict of interest for pharmaceuticals to contribute to any alternative to prescriptions?  The measly percentage they budget for is for goodwill and public perception only.
@FBI @TheJusticeDept I have submitted a complaint of rape and harassment to the @fbi and not one follow up.  You are failures in every sense of your duty.
They call "service" name calling and suggestions based upon previous conditioning designed to make one imagine or "picture" something specific which transmits to another waiting to expand the harassment.  It is still harassment whatever definition or context that is put on it.
This bio implant makes me look forward to going to heaven sooner rather than later.

@ericbolling @realDonaldTrump The focus can be only on street opoids.  The epidemic is the prescriptions also!  But with every push into healthcare, the legal drug dealers get more addicts.
@KimDotcom Until the above happens, there will always be a clandestine entity controlling surroundings with plausible deniability.
@KimDotcom 1.  End the fraternal/sorority/greek system.	2.  End the technology that is used for communicating clandestinely. (Thought to thought, etc)	3.  Force all money exchanges to be trackable on some type of blockchain like tracking.	4.  Throttle media/hollywood/politics.

@FoxNews @FLGovScott And give healthcare control.over a constitutional right?  You who use the first amendment to fight for the second amendment should be ashamed knowing full well what is really going on.
@StateDept So you just give it to hackers from other countries who dont have to follow the US rules?
@FoxNews @PressSec Including ending the bio communications devices that make it possible but deniable? @PressSec  @POTUS
@SpeakerRyan The pay for pornography sites are technically prostitution.  Sexual benefit in exchange for money.
@cnni Wrong focus.  A large problem is the legally prescribed opoids.  But the needle users are the ones who look the worst and dont take from the profits of pharmaceuticals, so of course the media will focus on that.
@AP_Oddities 100 grand for a bathroom and states and cities are outlawing homelessness.		#WelcomeToAmerica
@williamlegate The pharmaceuticals are the ones who are gaining in this. The NRS gets the blame, the background checks will drive folks to doctors who will prescribe medicine AND give psychology control over the 2nd amemdment.
Predator fishing trolls raping me 24/7 via buo communications device that I did not authorize to be raped with.		This is what happens when you are a decendant of Roger Williams in the United States of America.
The morons, referred to by a 4 as "evil" (a group)generate articles.  Then once a victim of bio rape reads it to themselves, more of their orders(over the cochlear) use the article to make others believe it is to be used for more harassment.	This is the U S of America	@KimDotcom
@DLoesch That ascii "I dont know" symbol looks familiar.  I first saw it on jester actual's twitter feed.  Any relation?
I softly read a prayer feom a tweet and jeard a neighbor say, "that was his mistake".  The same neighbor that has been participating in some of the harassment mentioned previously.
@NBCNews  https://t.co/wbvVpYf4rC
@business @gadfly They can  charge outrageous prices when they are the ones who surgically implant the method(bio comms implamts) used to keep power and cannot acknowledge the existence of for fear of losing control.  Good luck with that is right.
@NBCNewsWorld @NBCNews Let me guess.  Its because a woman was blackmailing him or threatening to destroy his reputation of he did not?
@JudicialWatch Snipe hunt
@JudicialWatch Its not just politics.  Its hollywood.  Its news anchors.  You are on a snup hunt.
@VP Who cares?  I dont when you womt even acknowledge what os done to us citizens.  Rape via healthcare with bio implants for forced communication.  Against my will.  Your issues mean nothing anymore.
@RonWyden Who cares about the issues you tweet about when you cannot acknowledge that healthcare rapes the citizens in your district causing much harm.  3's and 4's etc.  You know exactly what Im referring to.  I wrote you a letter about a rare committee meeting.
@CNN  https://t.co/tHqm4DSUzi
The view from my own eyes shows up in random social media adds.  It has been suggested that they are some sort of 'retinal phone call'.  Seeing through they eyes of that woman the other morning is consistant with what '4' and '3' do to each other.  Its harassment and rape.
@HuffPost @DrPhilGoff When they are puppeted by a feminist, of course a feminist would say they have much to teach us.
@people More like bleach.
@RachelGonKCMO @DeAnnaBurghart Harvard law also graduated students with law degrees at 13 and 14. Or is that not useful to your current point?
@Reuters The pharmaceutical companies are much more dangerous and will have you blame others while you are dying.
Some of.the dreams.that refuse to show certain detail, such as someone expected to be there in the construct, and dream to dream patterns, all while asking detailed questions to build upon.  Sounds more lile a forced maneuvering to use the details for later harassment.
Along lhe lines of retinal...where was it sunny about 7am pacific time.  Before I awoke, I was looking through the eyes of a woman who checked her rearview mirror with a worried look on her face.  She had eyeline around her entire eyes.  Possibly a medical smock on?
She is kind of hot though.  ;)
No.  The voices didnt tell her it was a condition of heaven.  I recall it Being something along the lines of, "here is a spoon if you want to gouge your eyes"'  only I looked at the spoon and thought the words oit.  Never spoken out loud. @FoxNews https://t.co/J5w4VvnMMD
@fbi I submitted this just a few minutes ago via the fbi tipline. https://t.co/cekoKYBJDy
@FoxNews Theft of data from buo implants amd cochlears happen because the governmemt WONT recognize what they are.  Its also rape when they are inserted in the human body withoit permission.  Like what happened to me.  Stop covering for human tragedies committed on US soil.
Cowards have to name call over the cochlear and claim to know who I am.  Im waiting for you.  Dont semd a double.  Be a fucking man and say it face to face.  Be a real woman and say it to my face.  Years of this torture has made me care nothing for your soul in eternity.
@dbongino God will judge the earth during tribulation.  All the name callers and trolls and other harassers will get theirs, while I am rejoicing.
@KimDotcom The whistleblowers are generally cover layers too.  Can you help with converting my bio implant to display on a television screen to prove to a room full of "experts" who deny what is being done with thought to thought, retinal, audio, nerve etc.?
@CillizzaCNN Do you have retinal or cochlear ?  Or does your writer and you are just being used?
@FoxNews @JudgeJeanine The problem is in the orders.  The forest is the lack of acknowledgement of the way of communication.  You all (all public voices) contribute to the problem.
Im thinking of.going back to the prescription nar otics I was overpresribed with  because of this bio implant ised for torture is worse than death.
@KimDotcom Not just money.
@KimDotcom Bio implants and the networks that keep them smokescreened and exploited.  Looking for someone to hack mine. Can reconstruct duplicate antenna and use some sort of rf to binary processor to atv screen to show capabilities.  No money, but hoping for someone who wants to experiment
@realDonaldTrump @SecretService For setting up obamas traffic control BEFORE the college shooting and subsequent "surprise" visit...?  Right.  Well done...
@dbongino A smokescreen that makes the pharmaceutical companies more customers and dollars.  Mental health...
@RadicalRuss *convicted
@RadicalRuss Criminal is one who has been covicted.  With unlimited powers to surveil and destroy lives in the process of trying to get a conviction, this government is the slowly boiling water to the frog that doesnt know it is being boiled alive.
No matter how much the harrassers claim to be beneficial to you, it is still harassment via cochlear and other mechanisms of the bio medical implant.  Its lile a rapist who switches to another rapist and says it benefits you.  It is still rape.
@CNN @BetsyDeVosED
@CNN Per bankruptcy attorney:  about $5k to file, governmemt always appeals(with mear unlimited resoirces to do so), another $5k to fight that.  Then only about 1/3 goes away.  Who has $10k to say they are too broke to pay student loans?
I was just let "know" that I'm the richest man in the world.  My lack of money says otherwise.
Raped by healthcare in the United States and they are more concerned with covering their own asses than admitting what has been done to me.  @uriminzok_engl @KremlinRussia_E @pid_gov @PMOIndia @Australia @IsraeliPM @nadplo @Ukraine @RusEmbTurkey
@usweekly No.  They are rich and like to play with the lives of others.  Is that you too?
The Texas Instruments JESD204B RF to digital(binary output) sounds like similar tech to what "Anonomous" protestors were claiming the @FBI was using to track their cell phones.  I would like to use the JESD204B to intercept from my bio implant to show what is done to citizens.
@mchooyah All have sinned.  Ergo, nobody is innocent.
@AutumnDawnPrice Media morons puppeted children to attempt to trap him.  Did you know that ISIS use children as human shields too?

@business @BV It also happens to contain an oil field between saudi and russian oil fields.
@business @BV Self harm.
@USAmbIsrael @USCGJerusalem @nikkihaley I noticed she mentioned something aboit an embassy yesterday.  Then one gets "attacked" today.  Similar to the UN violent extremist month that was the same day as a college shooting.  One which obamas traffic control was set up BEFORE the shooting.
I walk by a stranger who is speaking and if I listen, they say something like, "I have it" and then they too continue the voiced out harassment.  #removetheimplant
The harassment transfers from one to another depending on, among other things, simply thinking about any specific individual for any reason, whether triggered to think of them or not, then they start voicing it out.  #removetheimplant
@JesseBWatters As in trying to attach the suggested budding office romance with mary jane or some other substance?
@washingtonpost Because those have been words over the implant.  Where they turn up is just someone capitalizing for their own benefit.
@UnfilteredSE @secupp @andylevy @BecketAdams @MatthewMcCall Im sure you would spin it to be.
@HillaryClinton A puppet's cheerleader.
@washingtonpost Government whistleblowers are merely coverlayers.  Why else do you think the government wants to steer their narrative like the crisis actors steer narratives via media?
@AutumnDawnPrice Veterans, with a mental illness(ptsd), armed...I guess if the VA diagnosis someone qith a mental illness, then mental illness shouldnt affect gun ownership.  Oh wait...the other argument of mental illness and gun ownership.
@washingtonpost More like puppets.
Who benefits?  LE has always wanted superior weaponry to those they consider their enemies while the society hijacked media smokescreens with narratives like this Florida thing?  LE uses these events to convey details of unrelated happenings using hook phrases.
@FoxNews @newtgingrich That assumes the information provided to @wikileaks was not simply more cover expected to be the distraction.
When @DignityHealth merged with @CHIMercyVCND , this is what they inherited. @BannerHealth @molinahealth https://t.co/Kvo2fjZ98P
@DignityHealth see my MRI as proof of rape at your merged facility.
@FBI @POTUS @POTUS44
From the same mouth as harassment come phrases one muttered quietly to oneself with no other individual around, prior to ones suicide. If you tell me this bio implant I was raped with is not a comm. device, please stand by your word and put it in writing so you can be discredited
I would bet that if anyone asked those students to expand on those prepared speeches, they would not be able to provide any context that was not prepared for them to say.
@FoxNews That really reminds me of the Nazis, for some reason...
@FoxNews Ive been hearing, "thats a good sigh" over the cochlear for over a month.  Hmm.
@Paula_White Can God remove this foreign object I was raped with?  I.e. a bio medical device used for communication?  It was put inside without my permission and is being used for harassment and torture and theft.
@HHSGov @WHOLIBYA @ABAesq @FCC my MRI shows the communications foreign object left inside me without my permission amd is being used for torture purposes.  Mid field wireless etc.  Patent says it is inserted via back of throat.  I can feel the numb scar tissue. https://t.co/bzpov4cp5J
@washingtonpost Abort Planned Parenthood?
https://t.co/CN1bLrnIVW
https://t.co/xonPs1HMXK
Packets of data are physical.  Theft of and rape with every transmission.  With phones and computers etc, one can turn it off.  Guess what the current off switch is for a bio medical comms device inside your neck?
@CNN "Serve" has been redefined and attached to mean harass, both over cochlear and yelled or spoken in ear shot.  Sometimes two factored and sometimes direct. Its no wonder the cover argument is reversed.
..then all of a sudden it was transferred closer to me with softer voices so less folks would hear.  If someon is going to be yelling and or distorting anything from my implant, then I will continue thinking things that will make you hated.  Or you can end the technology.
Here is some a accountability since I've thrown parts of the process under the bus.  I noticed someone was yelling out my thoughts(apparenlty via the comms implant) together with other nonsense.  So I decided to think things that I know her neighboring ears dont wamt to hear...
@FoxNews Were you listening in on the crafted dream of similar surroundings then building upon comments thoight in he rram in interrogation style?
As I was typing this, I heard name calling over the cochlear implant.  Seems I strike a nerve when I type out the process of one of the harassment ways.
You say something jokingly and ends up in some news headline attached to some haneous act so if you claim it was your words tjay was used in conjunction with the remaining story subject then who you claim it to will think the haneous act was you also..  A liberal publication.
@dbongino "Systems"...?  Ending the technology is the only solutuons.  Houses cannot negotiate harassment away.  No matter who it is.
Let me be very clear.  A house is not a group of trolls with bad intentions.  I never authorized any such thing.  When they claims to be, it only serves to encoirage me to end this technology of harassment over the cochlear implant.
One style of harassment over the cochlear, gets "sold" and another takes its place.  The human trafficking natrative parallel maybe?  If they are just harassers, then dont argue for human trafficking unless to do so would be socially unacceptable?
@TIME The bible says ot is.better for a man to get married than to commot sins of the flesh, bit when you pray to jave a wife(lawfully wedded) and the answer seems to be "no", would that be a crisis?
After typing this, the same voice says, "yoir fault!"
One says, as if to threaten, "ill serve it", after previously namimg targeted harassment as "service".
@BNCartwright Love your neighbor as yourself
Start with analyzing the frequency spikes when transmissions /from happen.  Any takers with the right knowledge and tools?
@RealTrevorReese @ScottWalker Not really.  Its the societal orders using the rest of the world as pawns and starting conspiracy theories to cover their actions.  Whistleblowers are cover layers, not truth tellers.
@ScottWalker There is no point in voting anymore.
@TProphet @OffbeatChina Human bio medical tech hacking.  ?
@dbongino Medication tailored to block only certain neuronal activity does not fix a technology problem being used for harm.
@defcon
@engrepublic
@BallHardMillard You should read my tweet about hacking my biomedical implant and share the opportunity with your classmates.  Mid field wireless etc.
@POTUS @POTUS44 @dbongino @FBI @UN
I do not have cash to offer, but the potential for a hacker to discover how to control a human with a compiter should be enticing enough.  Obviously it is not a crime when the presence of the implant cannot be acknowledged.
I am offering the opportunity for hackers etc, to experiment with the bio medical implant I have discovered to be inside me.  The observed capabilites are: visual, auditory, nerve stimulation, muscular, smell and taste.  As of uet, no medical person jas acknowledged what it is.
@Franklin_Graham @JoyVBehar Their audience are those who think the voices over cochlears are "God".
@Paula_White Psychologically?
I will enjou their tribulation ans I am rejoicing at their destruction agter the rapture.  The harassers and raposts (the patent says it is inserted via the back of the throat) are all a stumbling block a according to scripture.
I suppose I could dig the Implant from my own head, but then I would be attempting to harm myself.  The chicken shit doctors wont admit what it is for fear of them getting foumd out for what they have done to me.
Befinning with bame calling, the antagonists claim its some  "helmet" or opposote or some other way to either get you to reverse admit to something or receive more harassment.  This happens mostly over the cochlear implant.  This serves as a log of methods of torture.
@dbongino @FCC The secret service displayed a "4" as I took a picture of the sniper on the building he went to...
@dbongino The term sprung up after the @FCC settled with media companies specifically following the campaign stops concurrent with "tragedies" and the voiced out nonsense that was used.  Kind of like how the traffic control for Obama visit was set up BEFORE the "school shooting"...
@dbongino "Fake news" was born of methods that cannot be acknowledged during to human rights violations reasons.  "Fake news" is simply the cover and voice-out of implanted communications devices and causes more harm than the heads it "helps".
@cnni Probably when Healthcare stops raping patients with communications implants.
@CBSNews Surprise!  It sounds like a push for a bigger budget.  Nah, that's nothing like raising the gun control debate because of a tragedy.
@dbongino How about how unsuspecting implant individuals watching live broadcasts of Russian state television, and others, was used to relay that back out before discovering and learning about the implant?  Plausibly deniable, hence the cover smoke.
@FoxNews If you see phonsphene image, say it because it's a harassment set up for another on the same frequency as you.
The more I type about how I was raped via healthcare, the more the technology is "protected" from discovery by way of slanderous suggestions.  I think a nerve has been struck.
@shannonrwatts Nope.  To discredit those who speak (or type) the truth of how plausibly deniable harassment occurrs.  When your very own thoughts are voiced out in various public figure, yet twisted speeches, how else are those in power to keep what is done secret.
@AutumnDawnPrice It's not, love your neighbor.  It's "love your neighbor AS yourself".
They seem to be in a domestic violence situation.  Interesting looking back...
As I typed about the shooting, a husband and wife voice out team said that it just screwed them over.  I guess they were setting the fishing for this narrative.
Maybe instead of thinking everyone knows what's best for him, they could have asked him directly, face to face, what help he could use. https://t.co/82jHTDNas5
The way the shooter and victims in the latest shooting will be crafted to talk about someone else across the open airwaves.  The focus of their details will cause damage to another in many ways.  I speak from experience.
I remember....being raped at Catholic Health initiatives Mercy Medical center in Roseburg Oregon.
@business That's called prostitution.
*through the cochlear.
A woman, sounding like she has a cold, and transmitting thro I ghost the cochlear, together with others who seem to be her supporters are at it again.  It began with disappointment when I awoke early to discover my alarm clock off and turned it on.  It's the little things.
@SecretService
They call name calling and suggeations based upon conditioning, "service" as if to justify their actions.
Direct and more abrasive name calling over the cochlear.  I may have struck a nerve.  Means I'll be divulging more of their methods.
@SusanWBrooks How about biotechnology threats currently happening?
@dbongino It goes back and forth.  One side triggers.  The other catches emotional, visual and auditory responses to the varying triggers.  Then it switches and previous responses, conditioned or not, are used for further triggering.
*stolen
I was just thinking how data packets are real and that they are being sole from me.  Someone nearby yells out audibly, "then I'll just return them".
...inadvertently communicated over the implant.  Meaning thinking and those thought processes are then transmitted to another, again my will.
They the "media" (and others) talk is this: culminated stalked information inserted into stories of bad people so as to claim it is about your information, one is appearing like the bad story, such as some criminal or horrific act with elements of what you have...
@UnfilteredSE @secupp You must know who is controlling your toddler then.  Do yours have "wires in their heads" too?  As remote controlled, the eyes can make them say anything.  How do you feel about that?
A woman claiming to be a demon only had information dating back to a certain hospital visit.  This woman was transmitting over my cochlear implant against my will.  She didn't much like it when I thought words that called her bullshit, thereby discrediting her to her peers.
Another morning of waking up to the sound of tormentors through the cochlear implant that is in the shape of a triangle.  at least being a passenger in someone else's dream hasn't occurred lately.
@Paula_White Can He remove this implant that the enemy inserted inside my body?
@UN
@mexico
@china
Who do you go to when your country is not helpful for atrocities they cannot even acknowledge?  You go to their enemies.
@washingtonpost Jesus' speaks in the bible and He says to "love your neighbor as yourself".
Another is that one is "held up" by another and subjected to the others...network of triggers and insults.  Both transmitted through cochlear and creatively voiced out.  It appears that the one who "holds" you up is your "face" outward.
Dominoes of cochlear/retinal goes a little something like this:  nerve pain in targeted area, forcing thinking of that body part causing a pretty determined reaction to that unintended imagery transmission to follow how it travels.  Pavlovs dog on steroids.
On President Abe Lincoln's borthday, let's take a moment and be honest about what really happens to American citizens on US soil.  Rape.  Torture.  Denial.  Theft.  Data packets are physical.  So are the communication devices that are denied to exist.
@WhiteHouse I formally request all information related to any investigation conducted about me, directly or indirectly, past or present, and request ADA reasonable accommodation for the method of request via @Twitter
Keeping a citizen safe is not raping them with a communication device againt their will and causing psychological harm.
One year later, that same hospital proclaimed, "oh, they have him under terrorism" as my iPhone was taken, then @Comey mirrored the results of the theft while using a flag event to communicate it.  That opened my eyes to the @FBI methods.  Thanks for that Jim.
The man in the hospital promised to put me "in charge of" a terrorist organization.  Lots of failed promises all around.  "We have ways"...
@Franklin_Graham Praying for a wife.  Scripture says it's better for a man to marry...when the answer is "no", what message does that send?
@RonWyden @Salem_Statesman How about regulating those "unregulated frequencies" used with biomedical inplants?
Simple answer: lack of slander. https://t.co/qKavFLMRAF
@FoxNews @foxandfriends @realDonaldTrump @TheDemocrats For.....what? :)
@realDonaldTrump Timely triggers to the verifiers laying in wait.
@CillizzaCNN Smartphone software automatically does it.  Did you not know this?
@Paula_White What if it is through an cochlear implant that was inserted inside your body without permission and you are forced to listen because the only off switch is death?
Visual reactions, among other responses, are stolen via implant to implant from varying triggers.  Then it is distorted in audio form to lead others to believe falsehoods.  This is why the implants have to be explained away as something it is not. @KimDotcom
Careful who your neighbors are, especially when it is your "last option".  They are listening, countering and eavesdropping on what is voiced out to serve the purpose of another who opposes you.  Plausible deniability.
@tedcruz @chiproytx As a namesake talking point?
@Franklin_Graham Those claiming to have some sort of a "holy agreement" are a stumbling block.  Brokenhearted?  There is no verse that covers what is happening to me.
Name calling seems to take on creativity by associating common words with previous accusations and morphing it to a continued barrage of the new name calling.  Both around you and through the cochlear to which there is no off switch.
@KremlinRussia_E
How the implant gets voiced out, answered and harassed as a "price" seems to be something that is valued as secret.  The one who "holds" you up is the face outward to any given network.
@DonaldJTrumpJr Where?  Is it followed with folks saying that it's "good pain"?
Will I get a financial settlement from being completely violated in a Catholic hospital?  They are experts at excuses and I have a net worth of zero.  I hate them with a vengeance and they are a stumbling block between me and God according to scripture they claim to teach from.
Targeted nerve pain and claims that it is "good pain".
Constant transmissions with varying methods of harassment over cochlear.  See avatar of mri of the foreign object.
Phosphenes showing still images paired with audible over the cochlear (put 8th without permission).  Full color images.  Sometimes moving phosphenes of what another is looking at (black and white imagry).
They claim to be helping you, but all they are doing is causing me harm.  Then say it's some sort of a "holy promise" as if that will get them off the hook for it.
Deniability is not plausible when there is medical imaging showing you were raped by a surgeon.  Yet the ones who would have to testify in a case are the same as those trying to cover their own asses.  #WelcomeToAmerica
@people That's the equivalent of several years salary for most families these libtards claim to speak for.  Congratulations. Another hypocrite.

@FoxNews @TGowdySC @FBI Like all the non prosecuted accusations that result in damage i.e. firings and resignations under duress?  Surely those were prosecuted in a court of law and hold true to the quoted statement.
@SenSanders I noticed how @POTUS danced around pharmaceutical accountability in the #SOTU.  Clear bias.  I was overprescribed.  Attempted suicide with my prescruptions.  Who do I sue?
@dbongino Typical.  The accuser is generally guilty of what they accuse of.
@KimDotcom It's called a biomedical implant over unregulated frequencies not acknowledged by the very industry who rapes citizens with them.  Then abused by those without morals to control others.
@mchooyah "We have ways".  Direct quote from someone faceless.
@dbongino So is assisted suicide.
Some dude keeps talking about his personal business around here...My earlier suspicions of Sutherlin seem to be coming to be not too far off.
Forcing someone to harass is in and of itself a construct of nothing good.  Trying to forcibly brainwash is even worse.  Psychology is a tool of nothing good.  Police use it.  So do ceiminals.  Neither has good eternal consequences as a stumbling block.
@TIME Which home?
@FoxNews @RepMarkMeadows @JudgeJeanine You may want to consider changing how you say "lady justice wears a blindfold".  When one with retinal capability wears a blindfold, that's when constitutional protections cannot protect anyone...Judge.  As with their process, they will steal the meaning and context to use it.
I'm learning every day.  The latest is that terrorist groups portrayed are only doubles or parallels for terrorist groups that cannot be acknowledged...by society.
A second Tinder app that has been used, in my name, to communicate to "matches" I was unaware of while using the version on my phone, is not only theft but it is a gross violation, id theft, potentially more serious crimes once I find out what was communicated via the other one.

Why would anyone, with their finger on the button controlling another's implant, ever want to do something like that...especially when 3rd. party's are observing without knowledge of the button presser?
Did you know that similar bio medical technology that helps amputees, can also be used with bad intentions?  Such as targeted nerve pain, targeted blood flow, targeted vibrations?
Anxiety med. Stopped the incoming phosphenes, but not the outgoing.  Cochlear still functioning...unfortunately.  but it's lessened.

@dbongino Voicing out somebody else's words may cause threatening behavior.
What is it called when someone rapes you to steal to use it to harass to the point of potential suicide?  It's call murder.
thought and emotional response following varying situations, transmitting against one's will violates human rights.  lying about someone by direct or suggestion or accusations is worse than anything accused or suggested and should be treated accordingly.
@dbongino ...and keeps the poor even more poor.
@dbongino Homeowners and benefactors of family law rules seem to be the ones that gain. Raising rents and refusing rule changes keep the well-off rich

It's not the president's tweet that causes America to be a target. It's the media and holy woods portrayals of women's empowerment that does https://t.co/Pbvqijdvtg
@secupp @Mediaite Who blames them after the display you all have been putting on?  Always the victim...
@Paula_White Is that why I heard, this time last uear, that torture was some sort of game?  What of you never chose to participate bit it is still done?
@FoxNews @SenTedCruz Who is 50...?  "Don't participate" comes to mind.
@NBCNews Women have yet to apologize for making America a target for terrorism.
@cspan @johnrobertsFox @PressSec Look at the media-placed  dopple asking pointed questions to attack a private person.  She received benefit for action that arouses. Whore
@RonWyden @jctgov Your actions and those of nost liberals, are making America a target.  Common enemy. No Korea isn't enough to deflect that.
@Paula_White Like voicing out harassment making yourself a stumbling block to new Christians?  Yep.  Sure can.
@allahpundit @DLoesch *fox not focus.  Autocorrect strikes again.
@allahpundit @DLoesch Hmm.  The accusations started at focus just before she left.  Now nbc.  Now she's the highs paid woman there.  Coincidence?
@WSJ Like the last CIA whistleblower for example.
@WSJ Covering for technology inserted inside the body.  "Whistle blowers" use confirmation bias then insert a false or deflected explanation.
@RonWyden ...thought and more allowing for secret duress and compel and harassment. (Torture).  Unregulated frequencies.
@RonWyden Not as absolute as what is secretly done to US Citizens on US soil via a foreign object put inside of someone (rape) that transmits...
The United States of America commits the worst human rights violations, writes rules so it doesn't get blamed, then blames others.
Until that human rights violation is addressed, this shit is just smoke and mirrors and parallels.
...and be repeated and spread around making everyone in the orders believe something that is misrepresented together with false accusations?
I wonder if this would include raping with an implant that transmits neural a Tivoli to be voiced out and recorded in a notebook and.... https://t.co/7iJWYjv93y
@mchooyah Guns don't kill people...wait.  am I getting arguments confused?
Reporting harassment and rape apparently only works when you are a woman.  They know this and use it.
@CBSNews Does it make you feel powerful when you can goad a man into responding by making him look bad to others when he doesnt?
@CassandraRules Wouldn't a woman keep something like that in her back pocket and "allow"a man to rise to power and influence so she can then use it against?
@CassandraRules No comparison, even on the parallel.  Example:  the pic of your dress netted how many sexist comments that you can use later for advantage?
@mchooyah Dreamers.  Those who share a frequency via retinal and...experience someone else's memories and programming.  Protecting dreamers...
@mchooyah Lining something...secret...up in reverse with something that is socially unacceptable to argue?  Psychologically stifling speech.
@CassandraRules Too much competition of a dildo in the war of the roses?
@DLoesch Typical female method of operation:  Look at the bad man so you don't see how women trap, prey, put the men in power who women have something over and then dispose of later.  The REAL predators.
...and THAT is how a woman usurps power with accusations.  Point proven. https://t.co/nSUMH29V1k
Wives, obey your husbands.  Those who do not are directly disobeying God.
@DailyMail @MailOnline Is that the reporter that blamed her editor for her own words?
@RonWyden When one suspects they are being stalked and harassed by the government, how does one check for the presence of a warrant?
Is the US Constitution even useful when most don't have the money to challenge overreach?
@Snowden And capitalizing on the collateral damage to further "surveille".  The technology itself, in the unregulated spectrum could be important...
@marcorubio How can this apply when one can bow be forced to listen?
@washingtonpost So put the brakes on the media.
Parallel for what happens why you don't think or do what they want you to when you have an implant.  They sting you with nerve pain. https://t.co/Cp1zUVtpqr
@Paula_White A job after being disabled and now on ticket to work, then custody of my children then to meet my future wife.
It's tough looking like a target of sexual harassment. https://t.co/ecsSUNbbFD
@dbongino Lots of collateral damage.
That must be why one of my accounts there is no longer very active.  They WERE mostly recommended by a fella from Ukraine.  Makes sense. https://t.co/1j793fc6rO
@jasoninthehouse More effective as a tool to scare some folks in the states into complying with the parallels of the time.
When the vagina vigilantes seem to be purposely keeping women away from you, they must want more men to hate them.  Gives them purpose?
@CassandraRules It definitely gets the attention of men if that's what your going for.
@mchooyah @KrisParonto *citizens of the United States.  That word has many contexts.
@dbongino They are the ones who directly benefit from devices of orderly torture.  Both monatarily and outward credibility.  #UWB #retinal #cochlear
@SenateMajLdr @POTUS Would you say they are helping hardworking families keep the real unemployed from getting employment?  Not just the 6 month unemployment #s?
@ggreenwald @KimDotcom @nzherald Unregulated frequencies.  Disavowed instead of accountability.
@secupp Including what you have done.  just as bad as Charles Manson.  By your argument, that statement would hold true.
Are there any women's accusations against drug company authority?  Why not?  Who gains from controlled individuals there?  Who pops more pills?
@RoidRonin @CassandraRules @JackPosobiec I looked back and made sure I didn't convey that's all life was about.  Lemme see.  Nope.  Sure didn't.  Just double checked.
@RoidRonin @CassandraRules It's there for a reason.  Just like when women troll the socially awkward in order to control them.  I found an alpha wannabe who belittles others to try and get into the pants of their public figure idol.
@secupp Avoiding how women accuse the heads to usurp power?  What do you thing the root cause in that is?  I think it is how women manipulate, trap, use, accuse and play victim all in one tidy little box.  forced technology that media uses to stalk.
@Paula_White When the harassment follows you like a scripted harassment bubble...even in church..where does one go to get away from that circle?
@FoxNews Sure the numbers weren't meant as something different?
@Paula_White Forced communication is not a gift.  It is a means of torture and justified by comments just like yours.  Stumbling blocks.
@Paula_White And those that think they are karma dealers?  Will theirs be 10 times worse?  Or are they using scripture as their reverse playbook?
@CNN Could it be that governmental agencies(such as ntnl. Security types...) us international news networks for usage as propaganda tools?
@CillizzaCNN Is using a public voice to trigger for the other side to "verify" among other harassment Constitutional?
@RadicalRuss @PDXRandyLee But focusing on the rape kits makes those who may be accused to be triggered to feel guilty and thus be driven to confess something.
@NBCNews Look at the little trumpkin do exactly as I predicted with my last tweet.  In real time.
@ABC That reference is a parallel gained by stalking designed to pit one family member against another...not of a public figure.
@KardashianReact Troll:  fingers indicating "little dick", the word "sub", the sugar daddy reference of "babygirl" all used to control men.
@RoidRonin @CassandraRules Answering a question of someone else with a personal attack against someone you know nothing about.  I think I recognize that libtard method of operation.
@katie_abu Scientific measuring of trolling ability?
@washingtonpost Because they would have competition then?
@FoxNews You mean put shape charges around their necks to scare the parallel out of others?
@LS_IA_AD manipulation of laws that can be paid for to be inserted into bills, laws, procedures and rules.  The root cause is the ability of women to manipulate men from all directions then shame them to further capitalize.
Right out of the playbook of family law.  Accuse.  Remove.  Usurp.  It works to gain the tax credit and control and it works to gain govnmt
@JoshJLauer @CassandraRules For the same reason I don't date bald women.  Makes sense.
@FoxNews A list of who's safe from the next round of libtard accusations?
@FoxNews @JudgeJeanine Any man could say that before buying dinner for his date...
@CassandraRules Have you considered that talking politics on a date may be why you are still single?
Your excuses make me think your crystal ball is broken.  Or never worked in the first place.
@AJEnglish I know that feeling.
@AP Tfw "crime fighting" becomes the crime in and of itself doing more harm than good.
@FoxNews Not hire longer than the 6 month of unemployment tracking and of course the numbers go down.  Report LFPR.
When a hillary shill names herself (on twitter) after a potential racial profiling name, what do you think the outcome will be to thinkers?
@FoxNews @JudgeJeanine Since the media perpetuates this nonsense.  Just think of the minimal legal fees associated if the press were not involved.
@dbongino Pepper on the retinal a few hours ago?  I saw that too and was wondering when, where and who would manifest that...
@TIME The language of the trolls for future control over men.
@valentinacm11 @katie_abu Women romanticize what gives them power over men. It will never change as long as there is still chivalry.
@DLoesch Capital punishment for torture over non acknowledged technology leading to violence and/or suicide? Is that why nobody will acknowlege?
That's the definition of predator.  When a woman does this to a man then the women in general claim victim hood and demonize men.
Yeah. She did that to me before I realized she may have authorized this foreign object to be put inside me without permission.  Spousal rape
Tfw you see your predator ex wife was mirroring/being mirrored by a kardashian.  Before said ex wife fucks your life over.  B4 awareness...
@FoxNews You are advancing the libtard agenda whether you know it or not.  But I think you know it because it's the women's agenda also.
Those who manipulate the anatomy via technology cause those who observe via other tech to murder under false pretense.
@FoxNews @POTUS @TIME Did he hear the voices that told him probably?
@ABC I'll bet that the amount of manhours required for that could have housed one homeless family for at least a month.  Priorities.
@SarahPalinUSA You realize that keeping libs under your collective thumbs produces the accusations that remove repubs from power, right?
Maybe I'll meet a beautiful woman of I start smoking cigarettes again.  It seems the beautiful women are withheld currently.  Why not?
@DLoesch The way it is conveyed has and the liberty at which folks abuse "free speech" to cause harm to another...more difficult to prove than intent
@TomFitton @JudicialWatch Judicial watch is a cuckold rag.
@TomFitton @JudicialWatch Is a past mistake the definition of corruption, or is the subsequent usage of it to usurp power the real corruption?
@nytimes Women wand this to happen because it demasculates men as a whole and gives them power over men.  Don't support this unless you are a cuck.
@FoxNews Budweiser face so ugly?
@nytimes Wolf wolf.
@TIME As in ELF?
@cnni Oh deer!
After typing that previous tweet, I hear in my apartment building, "hell never survive" as if they are reading my tweets as I type them.
Challenge the accusations.  It appears to be the reverse of reality of a non public figure.  Such as a Greek mirror maybe?
When they say, "cross it up", after I think of how I was raped as a man, then a celebrity woman accuses a public figure of some sex misdeed.
@AJEnglish The media and state dept. Has to have something to unwag when the time comes...
@AJEnglish Paid for talking points.
@dbongino If that were defined, then the parallel would lose its value.
Not working for a living wasn't the only condition.  You are a failure and a fraud.  Now your peers see that.
@truckrogers1 @DanScavino @NFL @Giants @oliviervernon54 I'm a veteran, btw.  So there's that.
@truckrogers1 @DanScavino @NFL @Giants @oliviervernon54 Send cash to do so.
@DanScavino @NFL @Giants @oliviervernon54 For what this country does to its citizens and lies about it, I don't blame anyone who kneels in protest amymore.
@cnni Why?  because it is a full fronal assault of women against men and this is only part of it.
That story about the neurologist isn't the kind of rape by healthcare I was talking about.  But it's consistent with the way things are done to discredit and cover their collective asses.
This is all done to me against my choosing.  I am being tortured 24/7.
And dreams?  You see a dream catcher in the public eye, it is in reference to those who dream others memories and other added information.
And the book and smiling?  That references others in proximity setting off a "locator" of sorts telling the live direction of others.
Reference to any audible, hearing etc refers to cochlear implants where audible information is transmitted.  Not unlike a hearing aid
Any reference to see, sight, vision etc is reference to transmitted visual information when eyes are closed.  Generally at a specific time.
If there is a 4 in a media story, be certain the bones are crossing it from the opposite.
If there is a 3 involved in any media story, it's a parallel for something that is being done to someone else.
Most people here are only alive because it is illegal to kill.
@OfficialSLC
It's sick what the United States is doing to me on US soil.  I no longer value this country.
@FoxNews @VP @SecondLady The rich and well off usually do.
I am ashamed for ever volunteering for military service in the U.S.  I am being tortured through a device I was raped with and accused of things 24/7 and interrogated constantly.  No arrest.  No trial.  No conviction.  @TheJusticeDept
The Unites States of America punishes those who are not successful at Suicide.  I am living proof of that. @UN
I was reaching for a @kroger brand item at the store and was shocked via foreign object inside me (3-30hz) and heard, "bad choice".

@SaudiEmbassyUSA @KremlinRussia_E @chinaorgcn @IndEmbMexico @PMOIndia @UNICEFAfg @denmarkinuk @RonWyden
Being raped by Healthcare in the United states has brought new perspective on who deserves to remain alive.
If you participate in helping women demonize men by any means, you are a cuck.
@johnnyo1378 It should be define first.  Women call men who like college age women that to make them feel bad about themselves.  It needs defined.
@dbongino It's suggestions like that, that others have aligned private individuals with and you are unwittingly causing fear.  You know this.
@Scavino45 @POTUS @realDonaldTrump Unemployment is only for 6 months...keep them actually unemployed longer than that and your unemployment numbers get better...LFPR though?  I remember writing about that false sense of security...
This lesbian has a triangle tattoo on her torso.

@Paula_White Social anxienty?  That paired with your comment suggest....
The wording of this headline suggests an implant of witness protection individuals surrounded by colors who harass?  how far off am I? https://t.co/osnZEeZidg
They are too sensitive to have someone compliment on them losing weight, but they spew foul language toward men.  Epitome of hypocrisy and completely discredits that side in my mind.  As if anyone receives a transmission of my mind though.... https://t.co/0mLTqxHchg

@secupp It's a crossed up story...I hate that women's issues get moved forward with my own thoughts of what has been done to me.  A male.
@secupp Hm.  Did she have teeth?
@secupp Was Monica Lewinsky intoxicated?
@katie_abu A question of clarification.  It's not as if the Manchurian thing is actually real, lol!
@katie_abu You mean they "make" presidents?  That's silly.  You would think there are boxes of drawings and notes of what is overheard around you.
@FBI @POTUS44 @KremlinRussia_E They involve whatever technology is pit in front of me.  Including Putin's state addresses in years past...
@FBI @POTUS44 @KremlinRussia_E 3 to 30 Hz for biomedical implants for starters.  Local line of sight frequencies for other capabilities of the device of rape.
What the US is doing to me on US soil is violating the constitution.  I was raped by healthcare.  Now more.  @FBI @POTUS44 @KremlinRussia_E
@Paula_White Is He really more powerful than time, orders, human networks, humans raped by electronics via Healthcare with clandestine comms?
@CassandraRules How about penetraring ones mouth with a foreign object while they are unconscious and leaving it inside them?  Is that rape or nah?
@DLoesch Nah. The voice out was girl power after a bit of harassment. Correlation between locations of women voicing out harassment. Is that far off?
Of an entity or individual is tricked to execute and doesn't know it, is it still murder?
@dbongino I'm sure the rich will shake it off.

@secupp @SenGillibrand What about the predatory behavior of women who troll for the purpose of getting this very information against men?  The true predators.
@secupp You use proxy sounding boards to refer to others whom you are legally unable to libel.  In return, you receive favors from power.
@secupp I've hear all the accusations.  Including that one.  Your ongoing behavior suggests otherwise.  Others behavior has changed...who's wrong?
@secupp An accusation doesn't make assault.  Was the intern drunk?  Was the intern passed out on anasthetic?
Oh.  Is hazing just one trick played on someone? https://t.co/ghiaE700K3

@secupp Watch your  libel is something I heard before the woman full frontal assault.  You might want to consider those who hear and do not care...
@secupp Have we seen the court documents of these accused?  I have not.  Yet you continue to libel.
@secupp Includes what Healthcare does to implant recipoents.
@secupp I guy who received a bj because a hill climber wanted to Excell is not a predator.  Regret is not rape.  Intoxication and asleep is.
@pkcapitol @CillizzaCNN They will approve who they are told to approve via their cochlear and retinal implants.
Doesn't the fbi need a cigarette?
How many do in the media?  How many in women led businesses?

@secupp An accusation of impropriety doesn't make assault but it does apparently allow the press to blow it out of proportion for ulterior motives!

@Paula_White Can those angels remove this foreign object that I was raped with?
This is being done to me against my choice and will.  All participants are my enemy.  No matter who they are.  I was raped by healthcare.
@GeraldoRivera Especially the mentally ill with PTSD! Too many with that mental illness can posess weapons and collect "disability" for mental illness

@UnfilteredSE @secupp @CokieRoberts No.  Your job is news.  Not vigilantism.
They seem to forget that a biomedical implant is technology.  A foreign object.  But still technology.  Some antennas can be digested.
@people The male response to false accusations applied to women's issues of body image.  Classic reversal.  You forgot some...
Those who do the accusing should serve the sentence of the crime they accuse of.  At a minimum.
No, I'm not what you accuse and who wants to start a petition to institute the death penalty to the accusers? (I have audio recordings)
@EricTrump Or pushing them to suicide and blaming something else ?
Woe to all of you.
This implant is a stumbling block (and all of its effects) according to my understanding of Scripture.  Inhumane.  In US Soil.
Am I faring badly because there are fools stealing my neural activity?  Not their companion by my choice. https://t.co/n5qW5w6YrM

The correlation of my audio recording around various locations with the same harassment words and phrases suggest what?
This is all done against my will.  I consider it harassment and torture.  Likely due to the foreign object I was raped with.
And this was just going to lunch.  When I sit down for a drink?  The beauty's (distraction) voice out while others bad mouth around me.

@CNN @CillizzaCNN Not good for whom?  And spies for who?  Maybe that's why it's not good for the media to be called out like that.
@GMB Um....can they or can't they make choices for themselves?  You all confuse me if you are to be believed.
Likely due to the glorified accusations.  They would probably get saved then accuse of some sexual misconduct.  Good riddance. https://t.co/LuM86wgCPk
@GMB More material in the raw material adds to cost of goods sold.  It just makes sense.
@FoxNews @dbongino They are likely tired of being lied to and about for the benefit of others who keep doing ir.  Such as yourself.
@CassandraRules Is that even possible?
@JohnCornyn Especially those with PTSD mental illness!  Someone subject to snapping at any moment should not ever have a weapon!
@CassandraRules Your Bernie to trump premeditated conversion under the veil of a foreign agent?
@Paula_White Even Adam had Eve.
@CassandraRules You have helped me turn against the 1A protections that press and individuals hide behind. Thank you for that.
@CassandraRules You hear the word "young" and your bias points to your kid.  Maybe the writer thinks "young" is in her 20's?  You should not be so quick to condemn.  btw, how's ES, TAO and NATO doing...? :)  Your old employer gets to register Monday.  :)  (as what?) it works both ways...
@Johnny__MAGA @CassandraRules Its a failed reply to the full frontal assault on men that women seem to be carrying out.  You are all the proverbial frog boiling in the kettle of water too judgmental to see that you can jump out.
@CassandraRules Prove it.  I've seen so many baseless accusations destroy lives, and I don't even know that guy.  Prove your libel.
They call it "crossed"
I present my MRI images and wait for STEM to learn of what is being done to me on US soil.
I think about a country and it pops into the news, somehow.  They say, "try and prove it", as I walk by some stranger...
Healthcare, obviously, but who ordered it?  And when?  That's rape.  Theft of neural activity and torture is continous.   Various methods.
The foreign object discovered inside my body is the mechanism that is constantly being used as a torture device.  Who put it there?

@secupp Hours on harassment?  Who have you sealy harassed?
@TIME There you go trying to strengthen the manipulation tool that women try and portray men as dogs to control them.
@CBSNews In a court of law.
@NBCNews Because of an accusation that is not a conviction?  That would set a precedent that goes against the constitution.
@GMB You should be a parent in all ways instead of relying on the fucking government to raise your kids for you!

@FoxNews @newtgingrich @HillaryClinton Sounds like that's what fox news, ABC etc have been getting away with too.  Just like the "game" to misdirect and blame something else.

This is the kind of torture and badgering that occurrs on the veterans property in the United States of America to United States Citizens.  rape by foreign object, torture etc, denial, discrediting and lying.  textbook from my criminal justice courses.
I keep hearing suggestions that someone around here is in that situation.  I know it isn't me, but this implant leads me to believe that I am being interrogated against my will.  I have requested any warrants with no reply.
If a person does not know they have been arrested, tried and/or convicted, then how can they challenge that constitutionally?

You don't question why public figures are acting this way?  Women troll men to get this type of stuff in their back pocket for future use...
@TheJusticeDept It is stalkers via implant(in me) echoing back through public figures and you are simply providing reason to the public.  Not too far off?
@CassandraRules That's between you and God.  Find your local pastor and ask him that.  As for me?  The vaginal vigilantes can all burn for eternity.
@ATFHQ @detroitpolice @DetroitFire Oh, the A stand for arson?
@FBI Then it should investigate the United States itself.
The word "celebrate" has been conditioned as part of the pro gay and now is being inserted back into other facets as attachments. https://t.co/kjjkwb9j2N
@GOP The non profit that gaga helped with is the sideboard voice...
The born gay/choose to be gay parallel that can't be argued without appearing terrible.  @GOP https://t.co/LHgeWVk9j1
@CillizzaCNN I visited your profile.  Donald Trump was apparently correct with that quote.
@CillizzaCNN You obviously don't like the constitution.  The accuser is to prove the accusation.  Not the other way around.  The press needs neutered.
@CassandraRules You must be of the belief that one goes to hell because you don't like them?  Read the Holy Bible.
@SenJohnMcCain https://t.co/iDBS768x2M
...and hide behind the first amendment of the Costitution of the US to accomplish it.  The US does not deserve world power anymore due to it
The world has been conditioned to believe when a woman cries wolf.  They don't question her anymore.  Public figures help this along and...
Thieves will always steal, just like public figures will always lie while saying it's the truth.
@people Casting couch as in the bang bros. Casting?
@washingtonpost Not just social media either...not just paid for acting and advertising, not just regular media...other forms of technology for control.
Did you notice Korea introduced trump as the leader of the world and China was portrayed as the most powerful?
@Canada @KremlinRussia_E @RusEmbVietnam @japan
When the United States uses this implant as a duress and compell tool of interrogation,  (by way of rape), the US no longer deserves power.
That moment when someone says, "he'll confess" thereby triggering those hearing to think about any possible past issues while RF is stolen.
@DonaldJTrumpJr He's a talking point.  Who are you really referring to?
@BSurferman I can't wait until you use that same assumption to get a girl drunk, get accused then rely upon that to keep you from getting convicted.
@BSurferman The argument for consent is ability to understand decision making.  Take that and apply it to deciding whether or not you should take the advice of miranda.  You argue like you are LE using it to skirt due process.
#WelcomeToAmerica
When a man is accused, the entire accusation is printed.  When a woman accuser is found to be a liar, the sides of the pages won't expand. https://t.co/g0OSrLGzWE
I don't blame God for destroying so many civilizations in scripture.  Not after my observations and experiences of human behavior.
Or are the stumbling block of harassers more powerful than God?
I've prayed to be married in holy matrimony as"it's better for a man to marry than to.."	A "no" must mean it's not better for a man to marry
Dear God,  I pray this world is destroyed swiftly and immediately for Your glory.  In Jesus' name, amen.
@WSJ I call bullshit.  They did it to me within hours.  And no.  They aren't talking about the public shooter.  They are referring to an unnamed.
Here is an idea:		Allow the last person that was harassed by the media/Hollywood to lead the @FCC
Hollywood and paid cable news are definitely included in that too.
Hypocrites.		The press has way too much power.  So do the databases that are social media.		Throttle them.		unless it's too late for you.
@FBI Lick my asshole clean and save a tree.  Cuba and bones.  You know it.  I know it.
@HuffPost Now they are attacking a sheriff deputy.  Splendid.
@USATODAY Idiots.
@BSurferman If one cannot consent to sex while intoxicated w/o the male being arrested for rape, then one cannot understand Miranda.  Simple logic.
@BSurferman Many arrests.  Many upheld convictions.
@FBI No.  It's used to skirt the constitution until enough people wise up to what you really do.  You and the Intel community together.
@WSJ Women do it to collect potential victims of their lure games.
@FBI So you can continue to steal 1's and 0's?  It's not as if neural activity is already being compelled then stolen.  Trick and trap.  W/o off
@FBI Wasn't there a power point about that the other morning?
@ericbolling Overprescribing.  Insurance required topping out on one drug to move to the next.  Not just a doctors choice.
@mchooyah Raised by their mothers, to be more accurate.
https://t.co/KnhHQlB6ej
@nbcsvu Yet they require the least amount of "evidence".  Coincidence?
When someone fakes their death, for whatever purpose, is it still illegal if that "dead" person dies by another's hand?
@BSurferman So one cannot consent to sex while intoxicated, but in a supreme court ruling can understand the Miranda rights being read?  More like the gov. having it's cake and eating it too.
@mchooyah oops.  didn't catch the sarcasm.  my mistake.
@mchooyah Gov run gun control... say that out loud and then read the constitution and the declaration of independence.  Then see where your error was.
@KrangTNelson @CassandraRules You spelled rat wrong.
@dbongino Should an accusation that has lesser standards of proof be the benchmark for removing a constitutional protection?
@CBSNews Way beyond company housing....
@secupp Quite the opposite in all likelihood given how media stalkers operate.  Women and media do that to men while crying that it is done to them
@AJEnglish @realDonaldTrump The mental health industry is the real problem to orders.  It discredits those who don't keep their mouth shut about how they are controlled
@TIME Jail time for using ones phone in the privacy of one's home.  You think you're free?  Think again.
@CassandraRules What he could mean is that as the media does elements of orders, your double could likely be a talking point...doesn't mean a threat?  Idea
Hmm..under the influence is rape, but arresting someone under the influence isn't false imprisonment? Can the intoxicated agree to miranda?
@CassandraRules Yet he still got a gun.  See how gun control works?
There will be am attack in Oman.  Not just time...
@RepCummings An act of terror aims to change the government by terror.  If public figures stopped talking, then it wouldn't be terrorism.

@TheBabylonBee @AutumnDawnPrice What does scripture say about gossiping?  You went to a Christian University, didn't you?
@AutumnDawnPrice Give to Ceasars what is Ceasars
@mchooyah 7....capitalized on...
@FoxNews Also, the stage was set by the cherry picked pundit and activated at the honalulu memorial...doesn't take a genius
@FoxNews Which flag event?
@secupp Oops.  You just sounded like a libtard right there.  Trying to attach a public hated figure because you don't like what someone had to say.
@IvankaTrump @realDonaldTrump  @POTUS  Babygirl has been deceitful.  Maybe another lap visit?
@IvankaTrump You mislead America.  You say it's a family issue while trolling women to hate men. You say it's pro family with maternity only
@NBCNews ...and there it is.  The very thing that "scared" senators due to the amount of "power" some tech companies have... orchestrated?
@CassandraRules The same milo who offered to "take it in the nose"... while at the conventions?  Or a different one?
@secupp There needs to be a streaming service to pick up the shows from these chicken shit production compaines. Maybe one that specializes in them?
@thehill Women seem to be raising children to be entitled man haters.
@FoxNews @IngrahamAngle Homosexuallity used to be considered deviant and illegal.
It seems like most women in the public eye seem to be playing victim these days.		It's almost as if they know it works...
@GWatson35 @cnni @ayeshahazarika I know what it causes all too well.  Except when it happens to men, the women still say they are the victims and men are not believed.
@GWatson35 @cnni @ayeshahazarika exactly and your very own behavior that is encouraged by the pubic voices enables those crying wolf.Vagina Vigilantism is counter productive
@GWatson35 @cnni @ayeshahazarika I have too.  Women don't own the monopoly of victimhood except when the population is told to by public voices.  It encourages crying wolf.
@GWatson35 @cnni @ayeshahazarika You have zero clue @GWatson35, Stop being biased and look at the whole picture.  You will see that you are only part of the herd.
@washingtonpost If they want equality, they shouldn't expect chivalry.
@HuffPost Isn't the military under Trumps chain of command?  Uniform Code of Military Justice... Doesn't like his subordinates?
@cnni @ayeshahazarika Women are so busy pointing their collective fingers that they don't see that their behavior is even worse for generations after.
@Snowden Did you watch the subcommittee where senators said they were scared of their 'power'(FB, Twitter &amp; G)? Wouldn't an example prompt action...?
@secupp @shannonrwatts You all just make the world hate men so more can cry wolf and gain benefit.  No need for paid lobby.
@secupp A woman's accusation gets a man's firearms taken.  Without court proceedings or a proper defense.  (Rubber stamped restraining orders).  2A?
@johncardillo It tells you not to walk with HRC.
@FoxNews @MichelleObama Because they would see through the vaginal vigilantism instead of looking forward to joining that type of behavior.
@EricTrump @dbongino Platforms of bush and obama....sound familiar?  I once wrote a paper for college saying exactly what you just did.  Many years ago.  Hmmm...
@CassandraRules The circle of economics.  It's inevitable.  Will it be in your  lifetime or the the next?
@TaliaMarMusic Or you could stop focusing on using children to further women's lib.
@FoxNews @MichelleObama Quite the opposite....
@TIME Because they want to be prepared to discredit or use you.
@seanhannity Think about the Constitution.
If I had enough resources, I would live in a land without a government.  Or much of a population.  If.  This country is a disappointment.
First they blame your family.  Then they lie to vet out of being blamed.  Well done FoxNews.  You managed to place a @POTUS and....
@GMB Elevators should only be individual.  Maybe two if they are skinny.  Even accidental touching is grounds for accusations.
@Cernovich Don't agree with the actions, but don't agree with the bashing.  Replace your name with that 4 letter word.  Same difference.
@MailOnline Don't expect a kiss.
@CassandraRules Are you okay with a mob bashing you and what you...really do...simply because they disagree with it?  their actions=not ok. bashing=not ok.
@StateDept @USCGJerusalem In other words:  Call it terrorism, so the constitution can be...ignored.
How soon would they stop posting selfies of tongues out if people kept photo shopping dick picks or carpet munching on them?
@Paula_White Even Adam had Eve.  If it's better for a man to marry, why would the answer be "no" when praying to be married?
@DailyCaller @MariaBartiromo old pic...but....plastic handle and novelty engraving...like out of a magazine?
@CassandraRules @Cernovich Were they protesting looks?  What would that have to do with the price of tea in China?
@AJEnglish Because they probably got caught doing what the women of America do?
@NavyTimes That's 60 millionaire us citizens that could use that to star businesses in the states.  But no.  Talking points instead.
@seanhannity Mob rule.  The loudest voice that plays on the fears of those who would listen seems to prevail.
@CassandraRules You haven't been paying attention long, have yoi?
...painfully and horribly.  With their loved ones watching.  And their bodies left in the streets.  As an example.
...and you, because there is always someone who doesn't like the choices that you make.  Then there are the false accusers.  They should die
I could give a shit what people do, but don't discriminate.  Kill 'em all and let God sort 'em out.  Those you don't like and...
Thieves and liars should be tortured until dead.  Wait.  No thief bashing.  *facepalm*  I guess it's okay to say someone should die then?
@CassandraRules Did you get a letter of recommendation, at least?
@FoxNews @KellyannePolls @POTUS Define middle class.
@JudicialWatch @TomFitton Gives a way around due process does it?
@CassandraRules Harassment nothing...
@billmaher You are two factoring harassment.  Shame on you, your family and anyone who has ever known you.  But am I talking about you or someone else?
Sexual harassment.  Sexist not to pursue that when it's woman on woman. https://t.co/ogllfqiCaP
@FoxNews cumbria?  How many women did it take to find something with that name?
Others do NOT know what's best for your children despite what the majority (groupthink) would suggest.
@BabylonProphets @CassandraRules Natural birth control and don't start international wars.  What could could go wrong?
@greggutfeld The worse thing would be forced images without an off switch that the other knows you hate.  And induced nightmares at specific times.
@PeterWStevenson @CillizzaCNN @PostKranish I believe that terminology is very specific.
...and those doing it?  Well, it is harder for them to get into heaven than the rich man or the camel through the eye of the needle.
The systematic full frontal assault against men continues.  You idiots are the frog boiling in the proverbial water...
Vagina.  The most ancient of currencies.
@CassandraRules Do you hear voices?  Seriously...I see a pattern in that.
@secupp See.  Or social engineer?  As in retinal...
@secupp Balance.  Women aren't the only victims.
The United states government conducts itself as the devil once once described as doing.  		Coincidence?		Probably not.		##WelcimeToAmerica
@DonaldJTrumpJr It is when you use that resignation from politics to carry a message that would only be plausible with given circumstamces.  You know this.

@WesleighOgle Is that your best friend?
@jefferiesshow That mom should go to prison for viewing child port then.

@RonWyden Do you ever wonder if the veil to be dropped in revelations is the veil of secrecy that is "national security"?  Imagine if they really knew
@HardlyApathetic @Breaking911 @CassandraRules Just because the media says something is true, does not mean it's how they say it is.  Show your source or it's fake news.
@HardlyApathetic @Breaking911 @CassandraRules That's not an arrest report.  That's using another media outlet as a source to allow you to not have to have the arrest report.
Was some ting wong with false accusations? https://t.co/KEHvQFXLZc
@CassandraRules Somebody who is really hungry does.
@JudicialWatch Giving them jurisdiction without a warrent.  Court documents yet or just media english?
@Breaking911 @CassandraRules Prove it.  Show the arrest report.
Stull incentive to destroy families due to greed.  This won't fix anything except pacify HHS, family law and women with greedy motives. https://t.co/jiWLuTUxev
@CassandraRules Accusations are the life destroyer.  Charges or no charges.  Most accusers know this.
@ChanelSkyexxx Even actresses who folks get aroused seeing are technically prostitution and should be respected in the sex trade for what they do.
@NickJFuentes You spelled *white men wrong.
Women have made it clear that I am not.  No I can devote my resources and thoughts... to shaming them as much as they shame men. https://t.co/JkjTxgJmeB
Not via torrent like is still available.  The AFF database was supplied by...others...blackmail does not happen like what is portrayed on tv
There were teachers accounts in the Ashley Madison database.  State issued email addresses.  Database acquire over twitter link from press.
When the press uses databases of porn sites to target men with two factor harassment, should they really be protected by 1A?
@TIME By telling the truth of what they have been doing all alomg?
@CassandraRules The truth that women use journalists and Hollywood to shame men into performing? (Aka blackmail)
@CassandraRules Which truth?  The one that Healthcare is mutually tied to keeping it secret?  The truth that women are collectively trying to discredit men?
The Democrats asked for all hand on deck and the women subsequently make accusations.  #WelcomeToAmerica and here I thought it was the Nov 5
A buffer was nowhere in any conversation was it?  Except somebody said to me once, "they're looking for a buffer..." hmm...
@Ohstrawberryjam @_ivyclaire I guess one less rape victim would be one less person contributing to the culture, so should I just go away mom of 2?
@Ohstrawberryjam @_ivyclaire Stop contributing?  That's what you are going to go with while addressing a rape victim?  Think about what that means now.
@CassandraRules *have
@CassandraRules They don't javelin as broad of an audience as the journos who use them to talk back and forth, 2 factoring harassment.  That is more vile.
@mchooyah Whose truth?  Just because Muslims believe Muhammed is their prophet, does that make it truth?
@billmaher Are you calling the @POTUS Russian then?  Surely you can produce court documents that support your accusations?  Bullying?  No dif. Than you

@FoxNews @EricTrump Wow.  I totally just saw senator graham's face in that fox news picture.

Depravation makes people do horrible things.  Maybe that is what is intended?
Actors should have to publicly divulge their financials together with who assigns then what work, on and off screen.  Favored or paid for.
@DonaldJTrumpJr Time doesn't heal all, but money sure helps.  He'll be fine if he has what it's claimed to be.
They appear to be heading off the "crazy cat lady" persona but it looks more like they are charging by the hour...?
@FoxNews Ever watch dirty Harry about a movie...?
@TomFitton Because their methods of investigation and information sharing would be divulged.  They won't let it happen.
@FoxNews @WattersWorld @TomiLahren @HillaryClinton Performing what she must because she is in the public eye.
@CassandraRules No such thing as love.
@FoxNews @ffweekend @realamymholmes @POTUS Probably mostly women because they would prefer to be man hating women instead of patriots.
Colors, sororities, fraternal orgs, higher ed, Hollywood and media should ante up and pay poor people money instead of acting out "activism"
@barstoolsports @PaigeSpiranac But the one on the lower left doesn't have any...
@DonaldJTrumpJr @realDonaldTrump They are using your father to two factor talk bad about someone else.  Just like your father does to others.

@CassandraRules Maybe they are just we the people check and balance of a press that gets abused while hiding behind 1A?  foreign press influenced the..	?
@DonaldJTrumpJr @dcexaminer Isn't that state sanctioned though.....?  Wouldn't it become an act of war by another government instead of terror?  Definition doesn't fit.

@CIA The technology is similar to cochlear implant.
@CIA Just overheard, "bad choice"
@CIA They did say, "he won't believe us."  That's an understatement.
The same tormentors who won't stop.  Like that @CIA torture pic with eyes forced open and blaring sound 24/7.  Name calling has been less.
Hearing someone say, "your a ____" where that is a number.  I'm not a number.  Tattoo it on my forearm if that's what you think.
I hear, "he won't see his house."  Funny.  Mine was foreclosed on last year and I'm about ready to declare bankruptcy.  Confused much?
@TIME Women always playing the victim.  Look how the click bait is written.

The U.S.A. tortures it's own citizens on U.S. soil and tells the public it's doing a good thing and helping.
@CassandraRules Perspective and high horses.  People thinking they are better than other people because they sin differently...to answer your quesrion.
@mchooyah @NFL Peer pressure and mob rule was why a thief got off and Jesus was killed.  He's not Jesus, but this is mob rule.
@mchooyah WHY are they kneeling?  It's not as if anyone knows the thoughts, or neural activity of another to be able to say for certain...
@FoxNews Isn't that legal there?  It's like accusing fox news of being advertising media hiding behind court cases only and not an actual "press"...
@ETaters @greggutfeld Should anyone with a foreign mail order bride be on any media?  Paid for or not...?
@billmaher If you see black versus white in statistics for an agenda, I think there is a little racism in you.
@LaurenSivan Was anyone falsely imprisoning that reporter?
@FoxNews @jessebwatters They can't afford anything that requires an attorney in any non criminal situation.  And PD's are more concerned with forgiven loans in CR..
Is she saying it is or is she saying she can't believe it?		What did sanders say this morning...? https://t.co/FiGyKsfYc0
@mchooyah What is the real reason for the security? Are they feeling guilty about something that usually those they need to worry about don't survive?
@realDonaldTrump Because they use it too in order to communicate through narratives.
@TIME That's discrimination....
@FoxNews @JeffFlake Somebody ran by a resentful woman.
@FoxNews Are there any victims with....extremely lucky kill shots not expected of spread fire?
@FoxNews Did he expect it or was he cover for someone else with a specific target in mind?  No reason, just an original thought of mine.
@FoxNews @TomiLahren False sense of security when PTSD and guns are in the same hands and head.
@FoxNews @seanhannity And the right thinks they are better than everyone else and should be the only ones who can legally own a weapon by overutilizing healthcare
@secupp Just as important?  How many people are harmed psychologically and emotionally from media that is protected by 1A?
@CassandraRules But journos are the biggest trolls of them all...
Loyalty to those whose assessment your nose is firmly planted will only get you money and hatred.  Do you think that those around you trust?
@FoxNews Hm, I was just thinking that about declaring bankruptcy. It was written down months ago as advice in moving forward.  Can stalkers mindread?

@RonWyden The company weas Broadspire/Sedjwick
@RonWyden Regularly lifting 100 lbs and hooking poles, covered injury for almost a year, then decided too expensive.
@RonWyden btw:  The work comp "IME" used the arthritis loophole in Oregon Statute.  The only "pre existing" condition to not require proof.
@RonWyden I'm biased.  With single payer/medicare for all, there would be no need for workers comp. The ones who deemed me pre existing to save a buck

@CassandraRules I see you as a double political operative who was pretty successful at trolling.
@TIME You can't have that open discussion without being accused and demonized for it. Their victim mentality, sold to you in the media has done it
You assholes have made me hate everyone.  In that, you succeeded.

@PunkleJones @CassandraRules The only reason I still listen is that the secret service communicated through some of her live periscope during primaries.
@PunkleJones @CassandraRules She was fired from teen vogue too.  Once the FBI caught up to her, she changed to a trumpkin.
The laws of this nation need to be abolished and started over.  Otherwise, I wouldn't be against euthanizing the entire country.
@CassandraRules Ending the internet is counter productive for those like you.  Technology itself needs to be ended.  The very frequencies of communication

@SSJLatora I read the journo that liked or replied to you.  You threatened to kill someone.  I attempted to get your def. of who you would kill and ...
@SSJLatora No.  It was attempting to gather information on a suspected criminal.  Threatening to kill is a crime.
@SSJLatora Suggestions of murdering someone based on a definition you won't/cant state? That is called trolling.  You said you would kill someone...
@SSJLatora My great g-ma was 13 when she was married.  That's why I ask.
@SSJLatora Seriously.  Internet trolls, such as yourself were calling people with 25 year old the same thing.  define "child"
@SSJLatora What is the definition?
ATTN Femenists:  If your pussy grabs back, you should probably get it looked at by a doctor.
@SSJLatora Define the word first.  I saw a 50 year old man who was with a 25 year old woman called that.
@ChaosApathy @VancityMaggie @spookylizard @jslambert1987 @CassandraRules Not condemning or condoning.  Again.  That's the illiteracy portion of your KSA.

@jperson80 @CassandraRules @krauthammer Psychology is only there to discredit those who can shed light on the truth that can hurt those in power.
Having he "right" to a public defender who is trying to get their student loans paid off is not the same as affording one that the rich can.
They hide behind confidentiality and make laws that help the rich. They think themselves as police.  They exploit their friends to get ahead
Attorneys are a huge problem.  They are tools of the rich to keep the poor in their places.
@boblatta Um...this statement will be used against you in the court of public opinion when the death penalty debate kicks up.
@business Taste is subjective.  Like pain.
@FN92 Upgrade to a felony.  Felon's with warrants or incarcerated cannot vote.  One of many possible solutions to that.
@mchooyah Why would the reminder sculpture look like lady parts if not another talking point...?
@CassandraRules Do you not see how he gave incintive Congress to act according to the constitution?  They make laws.  Exec. Enforces them. Justice opines.
@CassandraRules It's called kink.  Dd/lg.  You know that choker you and many more wear?  Yup.
Intelligence is a way around due process.  Fyi. https://t.co/slbD1pue51
@JackDeplorable Most who kill deserve death.  This coming from someone who was raped by someone who should be on a "registry".
@JackDeplorable In a sense, murderers have a less harsh punishment than those on a registry, huh?
@JackDeplorable Just an example.  It's never going to happen.
@JackDeplorable I think also, that murderers should be kept away from people for the rest of their lives.
@JackDeplorable It will eventually get there, in all liklihood.  Public perception and talking points on both sides of the issue need to be in place by then
@JackDeplorable Colorado court did rule the registry to be unconstitutional. It wouldn't surprise me if the sheriff's comments were preparing for the appeal
@JackDeplorable Goes to show that laws don't mean right and wrong is subjective.
@JackDeplorable It was legal and biblical.  Laws change.
@JackDeplorable The registry that the sheriff was referring to,which was what I commented about,did not separate the bad ones from the statatory(concentual)
@JackDeplorable The playground of the elites.  Where heads come together to experiment.
@JackDeplorable And owned slaves.  But that's beside the point...
@JackDeplorable Define child.  Keep in mind I decend from my great grandma who was married at age 13 and had several kids before 18.
@JackDeplorable Yet you called one state subjective.  states rights.  The first consistantly thing you've typed all day.
@JackDeplorable The way you talk is similar.  Go back upstairs and drink some more.  You might come back more normal.
@JackDeplorable Because you have no substance to back up your claim that you would prefer killing than following the constitution.
@JackDeplorable Deflection from the argument.  Typical tactic of a libtard.
@JackDeplorable You need to go back to your 4 reverse idiots and tell them they are fired.  If you don't know what that mean, you are hopeless.  Good day.
@JackDeplorable There's that illiteracy again.
@JackDeplorable Please block me so I don't have to waste any more of my time arguing with idiots who just want to be famous.
@JackDeplorable If you don't like how the laws are, maybe you should 1.learn how to argue and 2. Change the fucking laws!  I simply stated a loophole.
@JackDeplorable Sheriff.  Autocorrect fucked me.
@JackDeplorable You sound like a library trying to argue a point that is not winnable. But you claim to be a Repub who wants to go beyond the constitution
@JackDeplorable Look at the she offs comment that we are commenting about.  "Registered".  I thought you learned to read.  I was wrong.
@JackDeplorable Your Logic Says Death Penalty For them?
@JackDeplorable Define child, because a 19 y/o who sleeps with his/her 17 year old bf/gf lands on that registry too.
@JackDeplorable Are you, as a Republican calling for the death penalty for anyone on a registry?  Keep in mind, not all are cause kids.  What is your line?
@JackDeplorable Colarado.  A judge ruled it already.  Look it up you uninformed idiot.
@JackDeplorable That's your opinion.  Yoi represent republicans that executing on the spot is constitutional?
@JackDeplorable You argue for the constitutional side of things bit ignore the constitution for your own biases.
@JackDeplorable Did I say I wanted that?  Then again, you're illiterate.  Cruel and unusual.  Murderers get less.  Think about it.
@JackDeplorable Ask the Polk County LE if they are checking every felon's background and refusing them also.
@CassandraRules You make an assumption based upon logic made.  That's not journalism.
@CassandraRules They should have just killed their victims.  Murderers don't get cruel and unusual punishment like this.
@CoralReefer420 Kept away during custody battles.  Woman leaves, files status quo with accusation and judge rules in her favor. Uses alcohol as reason.
@CoralReefer420 But drinking is used against someone in family law as a leverage amd cintrol tool because others misbehave while intoxicated.
Emailto: communications@polk-county.net 	The sheriff is encouraging rapists to kill their victims.  Murderers get sheltered.
@FoxNews @POTUS That was a sounding board talking point for something else.
@TIME Cruel and unusual.  They might as well have killed their victims as that is a less cruel punishment.
@business ...that ends up getting out of paying anyway by using rules and Lawyers, in many cases?
@business You mean our brains aren't capable of overpaying for a 'good or service' that only takes effect when crime or disaster happens?
@__ramon17 Do you steal neural activity?
@business Easier?  How about bot holding someone's credit history against them?  Held under the thumb by a number.
@FoxNews @MonicaCrowley Try challenging an unconstitutional act without resources to hire legal help.
@FoxNews @MonicaCrowley This country is not the constitution.  The Constitution is used by those with money to control those without.
@POTUS is there any island in the world where one can move to and not be under the rule of another country?  To start a new civilization?
@billclinton Dreamer or parallel for dream weaver who has been inserting nightmares and, more recently, pointed dreams?  Or the literal dreamer?
@CassandraRules It forces the base of the legislators to organize to affect change, the way he worded it.
@TheFive @DanaPerino Oh yeah.  Kim un?  Just a representation of someone else as a talking point sounding board.
@TheFive @DanaPerino Always with an antichrist in waiting.  Welcome to globalism.

@RonWyden Why don't we look to how Canada treats young people?  They end up smarter than us and sooner.  Maybe a model to follow?
@RonWyden They are always watching you....or watching through you...who needs jails anymore when you can make them crazy with the credibility to lie?
@CassandraRules I heard about those women who like bones...
@FoxNews @TuckerCarlson But when that country keeps men inside the borders and will not let them leave (family law), that is imprisonment.
@FoxBusiness @GOP @POTUS A thief will always be a thief.
@mchooyah Or tell me what "make it rain" means...
@mchooyah It's not that I don't believe you.  I don't believe media.
@mchooyah Would you mind posting your short form dd-214?

Does the death penalty exist for those who conceal the truth and destroy your life to cover it up?  Should it?
@RonWyden What did the Nazis do with those they wanted to herd like cattle?
@RonWyden Free country?  Hasn't been for a VERY long time.
@RonWyden Child support imprisons men(and a small # of women because of family law) in this country by passport rules.  Keep em out &amp; keep em in.
@realDonaldTrump Both you and Obama have helped me to hate this country.  Congratulations.  You took a man's patriotism from him.
A stalker writer for .ru propaganda, fangirling a fugitive, force multilingual fbi and ss communications during election...hmmmm....
@CassandraRules Because they pay too much for it?
@shannonrwatts Because women are told to think and feel that by public faces.

@ColumbiaBugle @CassandraRules I thought size doesn't matter???
@GOP @POTUS So sick of hearing about vets and how much money is being poured into it.

@Franklin_Graham @netanyahu @HamasInfoEn
It is better for a man to marry than to commit sins of the flesh.  When one prays for holy matrimony and God answers no, is sin God's will?

Is this how the free press should be used?
This also produces "confessions" as guilt is a powerful thing...law enforcement uses this as it is an easy way to gets convictions...
...to show erratic behavior and 'make a mistake' according to one law enforcement instructor who is involved in television.
A news story of a criminal is used by law enforcement in many ways.  One is to hopefully make a reader, who is under investigation....
@FoxNews That's because they have to have something to spend the military budget on in the absence of overseas terrorism. gdp...do people not see it?
@tomangell so...confine them until they admit to a "crime" so they can confine them some more.  What does Geneva have to say about that...?

@SecretaryZinke @NationalMallNPS Tim Freeman lied to you.  I have our conversation on audio recording...
@SarahPalinUSA What's that?  Tell the truth?
@CassandraRules Define insane.
@SarahPalinUSA Thou shall not lie.  Do you or do you not have an implant that allows you to hear communications otherwise not access let to warrants?
@CassandraRules Fyi: dog hit by neighbor vehicle who reported it to me and I called 911 for AC.  The idiots who didn't get the facts just assumed....
@CassandraRules Please get the actual and non trumped up facts before calling someone an animal abuser.
@CassandraRules My reputation was ruined and I was the one who called 911 for animal control for an injured animal (disabled and unable to physically do it)
@CassandraRules From someone who was falsely accused on social media without them having the facts that I called animal control, you are a shitty person.
@CassandraRules So...you don't know the story if the owner had to or would have died and had to triage life and you applaud ruining reputations? Just wow.
@CassandraRules No, it's America that is backwards and thinks they are more than food.  The rest of the world loves in reality.
All these resources going toward domesticated animals and there are HUMANS who are poor and hungry.  Your priorities discredit you.

@TheFive @greggutfeld Nobody likes judgemental assholes either.
When a doctor makes a diagnosis and you don't find out until 6 months later, through a 3rd party, shouldn't that be considered malpractice?
The very same that republicans accused @BarackObama of doing.  Police state leading to martial law.  Hook. Line. Sinker. https://t.co/HDSmSqTcgE

@tomangell Via chart notes of doctors who have known biases, partly due to threat of their medical liscensure?  Now that's scientific!
@SpeakerRyan Disability loan forgiveness only available in certain circumstances.  Does not apply to clear up FASFA
@SpeakerRyan No real incintive to improve exists and barriers by rules keep people poor in my situation.

The torture through the implant continues and the deceit over technology is getting so bad it's boring me.

@WhiteHouse ...except those that you disagree with, right?  Or is this a goal?
....they switch and you don't get what you intend.  "The system is rigged" said @POTUS.  He was right on that point.

When thinking to myself, as I've not authorized theft of my neural activity, I often hear the words,"fuck him". Is that with a happy ending?
@CassandraRules Are you a private server?
They control the people around you to "fuck him over, just not to his face'.
They say they are 'helping', but they have destroyed your life and only do something of you do what they want you to do.
The only option I know of to turn it off is suicide.  This is America.  This is Oregon.  This is Douglas County.

@FoxNews @jessebwatters No.  The threat is the lie covering up the colors and orders that perpetuate the lie so it retains control.  Just another talking point.
@RepPaulMitchell When a parent can be accused of kidnapping their own children, for any reason, and government 'enforces'?  #abolish or never say the word.

Not patient enough?  Not enough faith?  Those STEALING neural activity know how much faith in God I had...until they ruined it.  Ex. 20:15
It appears that God is not more powerful than the opposition.  Either that or the Bible is not God's word.  Which is it?

Me?  You have already transmitted that you "help", but have caused destruction.  You have attempted to answer prayer.  What does scripture..
Your truth is much bigger and will cause much more damage when being revealed. You will be made known as a liar...to history.

Now the few doctors I have seen since insist they see nothing abnormal with the imaging.  Obviously to admit they do would be to admit rape.
I accidentally discovered the implant via MRI imagine done.  Clearly that was what the locals had hoped would not happen.  They fucked up.
I was intentionally raped and never authorized.  Spousal and Healthcare rape. According to the golden rule, you should expect the "reversal"
Out of the blue, my primart doctor called and scheduled the procedure.  It was one I had not been expecting or discussing.
Those transmitting through the cochlear have claimed to be her "family".  Several suicide attempts later, here we are.
The ex signed for the procedure that I thought was being done.  Little did I know it was the implant instead.  She used it to help destroy.
If God created us nude, why would Christians have to be clothed in robes in heaven as Revelations states?
One could look at judges as the antichrist.  Those who try to take the place of God.

I write an email and I hear through the implant, "Who was that, find out now".  Naw, stalking doesn't happen at all, does it?

Fucking torture on United States soil.  Harassment.
It's almost as if they transmit what they are going to do before they use the pawns to do it.

The stalkers with gold watches and cell phones pointed at me were out again.  Got a picture of this one.  Tattooed idiots were out too.
irredeemable and undesirable kind of go hand in hand in Oregon.

@BillyGraham All thinking must be sinful if it doesn't agree with.....which moithpiece?
"better for a man to marry...".  A "no" answer to prayer for holy matrimony violates scripture.
@jakes313 @Franklin_Graham When you pray for marriage and the apparent answer is "no", then God must condone living in sins of the flesh...contrary to scripture.
It's 9:11.  Do you know where your planes are?
I'm losing my belief based upon the deceitful behavior of those around me...and answers to prayer that are contrary to scripture.
@Franklin_Graham Religions do not seem to be concerned with family.  It seems more about control.  All religions.
@Franklin_Graham Blessed is he who prays for marriage, and God answers no, so sins of the flesh has to happen.  No?  One or the other...
Coincidence that Merkel rolls her eyes to Putin just like the ex did to me whenever she lied?
What does scripture say about the body part that causes one to sin?  Like theft? Thought? Why obey only one part of scripture &amp; not another?

@Franklin_Graham @BillyGraham Kinda like what women call their "pussys"?
Everyone seems to communicate that they are "helping". I call bullshit.  Somebody else must be receiving the "help". Hurt is all I'm getting
I used to love the United States of America.  Now I fucking hate it with all I've got.  What changed?
The more an individual is disparaged and defamed, the more they want to kidnap and isolate themselves.  kidnap a companion.  not a child.
In The U.S of America, they torture you via technology(implants) and communicate to you that they are "helping" you w/o an off switch.
Just heard through the implant, "do you know the price of love?".  Define love.
@dennisak Technology, including Internet and others, distorts and confuses.  Face to face is how I do things.
@dennisak Give it up.  Repentance isn't coerced.  It's not withholding what someone wants until they say what you want them to say.  Hypocrisy.
What do the words "Give it Time" mean?
@Franklin_Graham Your dad led my mom to Christ.  That is why you are on my Twitter.  I hear...that you are hilarity...is that true?
@Franklin_Graham Been there, done that. It is better for man to marry than to live in sin. If the answer is "no" to a wife, that must mean God want us to sin

"They record us"...let's watch it together and have an orgy.  Sins of the flesh or holy mattimony.  A no to prayer is contrary to scripture.
@th3j35t3r "There's an ocean out there"...out where?
Might as well start smoking cigarettes again.  Nothing else to do when you are harassed by time, halarity, orders, colors etc like I am.
@KimDotcom Is it really a game?
I really hope you idiots enjoy the tribulation.  I will be rejoicing.  Know this as you are getting your asses handed to you by God.
No.  There is no ocean out there and there are no fish left in it.
@dennisak Can't you find false freedom if you bow to the orders and allow them to "answer prayer" in the place of God?
One or the other.  Sins of the flesh or holy matrimony.  Did you think I was joking?  It's better for a man to marry than to live in sin...
You should wait until you die for the thing you want.  I'm sure it's in scripture somewhere...or can be interpreted that way to suit a need.

Anyone who implants a device inside another without sober permission, deserves the death penaly.  And I wouldnt feel guilty.

@CAResists @th3j35t3r Typical halarity method of operation...
Or this that is at a different slice of the MRI?  In getting sick of being lied to and about and other things after my life was destroyed. https://t.co/5PgN4PJccY
It wouldn't have anything to do with this...that is connected to the avatar picture...nah...couldn't be. https://t.co/X5JqGEnF9j
Intelligence or implants?
Is it Time, or area, or halarity or...capital punishment anyone?  Harassment, torture,badgering, horsemen and voicemails, etc.  Fuck you all
"Under the influence of Intoxicants" only works when authority benefits?
not even an implant can help 2 people have emotions for each other.
@tedcruz Yet it's taken away in family court without due process.  Imagine that.
*transmission
Having an object, that appears to be an implant, forced inside your body without consent is rape.  Forced transition through it is torture.
Technology has failed, yet again, at making human connections.
Btw:  a dating show on TV and an app full or orderly fakes doesn't count.
If you can't use your influence and power to help men find love of a beautiful woman, that's not being good for anything of substance.
Who cares if a beautiful woman is "offsides" or not.  Nobody gets to decide for me.
Then maybe I could actually meet a beautiful woman and actually start over.  Don't I get a choice?
Let's see.  Hope and prayer and networks who seem to want to take credit.  I would get away from it all if I had a choice.
*misery
Moseey.  That's what all of this has accomplished.  Good shot.  Pat of the back.  Comgratulations.  You are a destroyer of lives.
The idiots over technology that attempt to attach something good with something bad are part of the problem.
@CHIMercyVCND
Do you believe everything said by someone who just swallowed a handful of pain killers?  If so, a woman can make choices on roofies...
Trust is built face to face.  A voice heard is not to be trusted.
Technology destroys lives and relationships.  No matter how hard people try to use it to "help".
God's will is apparent to me to be against "family", and not in the network context.
I'm miserable because of all this bullshit and it was done against my choice.  Triangles and numbers make a woman unattractive.
Having patience is not necessarily a good thing.  It may be a control thing.  Think only during certain hours and not others?
Shouldn't there be a tax on hackers?
@facebook @Twitter #WelcomeToAmerica
@facebook @Twitter And time and halarity and reversals and mouthpieces perpetuate it going forward, who will be the next accessory?
@facebook @twitter when stalking over social media leads in part to suicide, who is the accessory?
Welcome to America...this is not a country I would ever choose to live in based upon the last several years.
Welcome to America where if you don't choose what they want you to choose, then you are harassed some more and set up.
Welcome to America where all options are removed except the one they want you to choose.  They might give you two just to mirror the bible.
Welcome to America where colors and power are used to destroy lives instead of the help that they claim to be performing.
Welcome to America where your very religion is not challenged, but taken from you.
Welcome to America where your surroundings are "set" and you are expected to perform.
Welcome to America where you are raped by an implant and forced to endure torture.  EyesWideOpen, Can'tStopHearing, MouthpiecesAllAround
Welcome to America where technology via implants that cannot be turned off are the actual of the representation of CIA torture.
Welcome to America where professional stalkers double your life and add other things to suggest to others defamatory information.
Welcome to America where and area of jokers think they are funny harassing people by tying words and context's to something bad.
Welcome to America where U.S. Citizens are harassed to the point of sin and crime unless they comply.  Then are called upon to be slaves.
@th3j35t3r @DarrenPlane You mean the ITTT or the setting people up?  Where's the context...?
Mandatory minimums for hacking?  I think it's a great idea!
@Franklin_Graham @POTUS @BarackObama @georgepbush @RMTGB @catholicEW
Who cares about which network.  Rape is rape.
Getting implanted with a device against your will and consent, sober or otherwise is considered rape by any measure. #ScarOnBackOfNeck

@th3j35t3r Except paperwork.  This is how lone wolf shooters happen.  FYI...
@KimDotcom @wikileaks Is there such a thing as due process when one country goes after the citizen of another?  Or is it an act of war?
@th3j35t3r Silence only serves those who currently hold the cards.
@KimDotcom At least there is some benefit to being celebate, whether by choice or not.  Might as well fill a role while getting screwed (or not).
@CoralReefer420 It's awful lonely at the top though.

@FBIMiamiFL @FBI @JamesComeyFBI remember the San bernadino phone grab?  Oh yeah.  I'll teach them how you communicate also.
@FBIMiamiFL @FBI Together with my accusation of the "duress and compell" campaign a week before I committed suicide. Should that instill respect for the law?
@FBIMiamiFL @FBI *ass
@FBIMiamiFL @FBI HIPPA?  My assignment CHI.  FBI confidentiallity?  I have audio recordings of the accusations since with the death threats also.
@FBIMiamiFL @FBI Notice my @.  Gang stalked to death.  Ended in suicide.  The "investigation" did.  I have proof.  Capital punishment anyone?
@FBIMiamiFL @FBI I was accused of this, falsely, years ago in a hospital.  Now I get death threats.  Now I will teach them how to get away with it.  Happy?
@FBIMiamiFL @FBI They have to prove you are aroused and like it.
@FBIMiamiFL @FBI They rely on confessions.

@th3j35t3r Loose ends?
There is neither a law in scripture nor a law in government that prevents cussing (aside from taking Lords name in vain).  Is it still sin?
If obeying God means killing the adultress, would you still claim to be a Christian?  I guess we CAN pick and choose which rules to follow.
In the future, when you can't cover up your lies anymore, they will say "that guy was right all along".  History is on my side.
If you pray for a wife and Christians say the answer was "no.when it doesn't happen,, does that mean God is against marriage?
@sones09 @Franklin_Graham Ironically, those who profess to be Chistians anymore just may be the ones left behind.  Networks before God?  That's just splitting bones.
"Tow the line or you may get shamed".  This is why the church will.be judged by god.  Terrorism by another name.
@DonaldJTrumpJr What would the Muslims say when we kill them for doing the very thing you got photographed doing?  And the president's son, no less.
@th3j35t3r Bio attack.  Without pilots, no need for runways in the first place.  Oh wait...full circle.
"Do unto others as you would have done unto you..."  like when I was pushed to suicide?  Goes both ways.  Sweet dreams.
@Franklin_Graham But when the Christian are the ones who make the world even darker, what than?
@Franklin_Graham God doesn't want marriage to happen.  Please stop using the bible for your personal agendas.
@The4thRose @th3j35t3r Mine's got a scorpion living in it.  Stings when overcooked.
@th3j35t3r I'm sure someone out there can verify...
@th3j35t3r I belly laughed at this one.  Does that mean I was surveilled too? Lol
@seanhannity Would you say more or less arrogant than half of the media staffers and those with ears, let them hear..
Women who kidnap children from their fathers using "legal means should be tried under capital punishment laws.
I hope Russia retaliated with force.  And not just through proxies.
When committing suicide, failure is not an option.  If you do, society and the US punishes you.  Welcome to America.

@th3j35t3r He's a formula running bully who should get a MRI for public review to prove he is not under the influence of others.  Elected.  Not shadow.
@ClintonFdn Start with weight loss programs.
It's a good thing God loves the cows and the whales.  Nobody else does.
@KimDotcom Shouldn't there be some sort of marking depicting implanted communications device linked to bitcoin?  Just a thought...
What if someone could...'intercept' retinal?  Would that be valuable to somebody?  As in able to monetize?
@dennisak Thank you.  I had also heard that laws are to make one aware of sin, but am more of a legalistic mind than most.  It warns against that too.
@katyperry No longer than what?  :)  One PK to another...  Love what you do!
@amazon Silly me...The antennas must be a lot longer than that.  They could fit a couple in Wisconsin and one in Michigan, couldn't they?
@amazon Does it handle 3-30 Hz?
@ainsleyearhardt @TimTebow @foxandfriends @FoxNews Only Christians.  The rest are future children of God if they so choose to accept, as I understand it.
Another evening of absolutely boring nothingness.  Is it bad when you look forward to the next catastrophe in the news?
@th3j35t3r Wait for it...there's always a wrap around to his benefit.
@megannmcnamara Hi :)
Raped by Healthcare, piss poor, and passive discrimination creating a barrier to employment.  Yay for America.
@dennisak Of course.  Grew up hearing it.  I'm a local PK.
https://t.co/AGOA0WUxqW
@SusanWBrooks @RepRaskin When will women stop raping their children with non medically necessary implants utilizing Healthcare practitioners to do it? #equality
@dennisak Like stoning an adultress to death?  I never have gotten an answer about which laws are now current...
So far, the hate and discontent from this region is as expected.  If they only knew.  #humanity
@th3j35t3r Welcome to America.
Here's another slice of the MRI.  Does anyone know of this is anatomical or is that 2 antenna arrays and a retinal coil?  Rape by Healthcare https://t.co/CjwwXnBaX5
I asked and have not received.  I guess it is God's will that families are not together and marriage/procreation does not happen.
So when someone coerces you for the "truth", just ask, "whose truth?"
I don't know why she would have hid the fact that wires were implanted into our child's head.  Perhaps she was afraid of the truth known?
@RandPaul MRI's for everyone then?
Why stop at the red planet?  If anything is possible let's explore further.  Were you just kidding that "anything is possible"?  Halarious. https://t.co/4tL6OTzRjA
If the media can wag the dog, can it unwag the dog?  It's supposed to be a false peace anyway...just a random thought.
@dennisak *or woman
Does spousal rape only happen when a woman claims it?  How about when a woman violates a man?  Like authorizing an implant w/o knowledge?
This is according to criminal justice instruction at college.
Second:  Confessions are a key element in getting a conviction.
How? You might ask....prostitution by formula.
First:  It has to be proven that is your type.
Welp.  Looks like I'll be teaching them how to get away with it instead.  Shame it came to this.  Everyone had a choice.

@OregonVB @Pac12Network @taylor_agost Beauty
@substddev @DaveSimons @joshtpm They don't participate themselves.  They appear to run formula to pull them out so they can be caught in the act. More harm than good?
You ever hear your kid tell you that his mom "put wires in his head, while I was at work"?  Me neither, until today.  Goddamn rape.
Better to be pissed off and surrounded by yours, than pissed on and alone.  #Brightside

@GngStlkd2Death The opposing party said something that said she was attempting to verify if "Illuminati".  That's interesting.
@GngStlkd2Death I mentioned this out loud, knowing I have been under close observation for some time and not long after, the orig. comment.
@GngStlkd2Death In court - docket cleared and only ex wife and I were in court.  Judge pointed to his ear as he "made his judgement".
#Coincidence I insult local judge and dems all of a sudden attack justice in media.  Should I try it again?  Taking bets.
@KimDotcom @FBI @Apple It's just a phone call away.  They have no need to "unlock".  Only talking head parallels in Duress &amp; Compel attempt.
If your elected officials and their appointees were under the influence of somebody else you didn't know of, wouldn't you want to find out?

Ever get the feeling that when you change your appearance, the media then releases images of criminals that appear similar.  #Gangstalkling
@GngStlkd2Death 'formula' is a word often overheard. Such as when a burglar is bombarded with stories about theft to induce guilt and react?
Slavery.  Do you think that lone wolf shooters are an intended or an unintended consequence?  Did the national guardsmen have implants?
