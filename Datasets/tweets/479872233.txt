Our FY 2019 DHS conference bill makes many smart and effective investments in our border security, and I will continue to fight for those investments in FY 2020.
Instead of funding Trump’s so-called emergency wall, we must hire more customs officers; keep deploying effective border security tech; hire more law enforcement for opioid, trade, and child exploitation investigations; and ensure our Coast Guard can protect U.S. interests.
The president was unable to get Mexico to pay for his border wall, so he shut down our government and cut off pay for 800,000 hardworking U.S. federal employees. Now he'll reportedly announce an emergency action to address a crisis that does not exist.
The only emergency at our border has been the capacity of @CBP to care for migrant families and children who are temporarily in their custody after fleeing violence in their home countries. Trump’s border wall does absolutely nothing to solve that problem. https://t.co/rNCzy1IRC7

As chair of the Homeland Security Appropriations Subcommittee, I look forward to working with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to quickly produce full-year funding legislation for DHS that reflects our values and addresses our true security vulnerabilities.
The president should never have shut down the govt in the first place.  He &amp; Senate Leader McConnell have spent 35 days forcing stress, fear &amp; financial pain on so many of our fellow Americans, holding them hostage to the #TrumpShutdown's deeply ill-conceived &amp; unpopular demands.
The #TrumpShutdown has been a tragic &amp; totally unnecessary assault on America and our federal workers. The president has rightly agreed to do what Democrats have been advocating all along—open the government immediately with no conditions, including no money for his border wall.
Without #DHS funding, @SecretService employees are literally risking their lives without pay. The House passed my legislation today to reopen DHS and provide back pay for its workers. Will the president join us to restore pay for the #SecretService agents who protect him? https://t.co/tc74OLiTe9

We are at a deeply consequential moment for our #DHS Approps Subcmte and for DHS itself. The department faces urgent funding demands on many fronts, and the Trump Admin has too often demanded cruel, ineffective, and wasteful policies that simply do not help us keep America safe.

Air traffic controllers, food inspectors, TSA workers and more are going without pay because of the president's irresponsible, wasteful #TrumpShutdown. @HouseDemocrats have voted to #EndTheShutdown and reopen government. When will Republican leaders join us?
As original #DreamAct co-author, I know we must offer real, permanent protections for #Dreamers. Once govt reopens, I look fwd to POTUS's support for helping those harmed by Trump Admin attacks on #DACA – but honest negotiations CANNOT happen while POTUS holds the govt hostage.
Once we #EndTheShutdown and reopen government, members of both parties can work to reach agreement on true border security, on protecting our Dreamers and TPS recipients, and on reforming all broken elements of our immigration system.
House Democrats have voted over and over again to #EndTheShutdown and reopen the govt without wasting billions on the president’s wall. House Democrats will continue to do so next week. I urge POTUS &amp; @SenateGOP to join us in passing legislation to reopen the govt without delay.
The president has prolonged the #TrumpShutdown’s suffering and damage to our nation because he thinks it gives him leverage for a deal to waste billions on his cruel and ineffective border wall.
POTUS proudly claimed he owns the shutdown. Now he owns the fact that the families of 800,000 federal workers are trying to make ends meet without a paycheck. He owns the fact that our food is going uninspected. He owns the fact that small business loans are going unapproved.

When Republicans controlled the House, President Trump may have thought he could get away with this cruelty and incompetence. But those days are over.
Not only did the Trump Administration take thousands more children away from their parents – it failed to keep information about the total number and current status of children separated from their parents or guardians. That’s unconscionable and inexcusable.

We need money for critical security priorities—hiring more customs officers; hiring more law enforcement agents to focus on opioid, gang, trade &amp; child exploitation investigations; deploying more tech at our ports; strengthening our Coast Guard; and more—but not for Trump's wall.
The real crisis is that children are dying in Border Patrol custody due to inadequate facilities and an utter lack of appropriate medical care. The president should be ramping up medical care for kids, not building a wall.
The president thinks he can get you to believe there's a national emergency at the border, but there isn't. We need to get serious about keeping America safe, and we won't do that by spending billions of dollars on Trump's cruel and pointless border wall.
Donald Trump can talk and tweet all day and all night, but he can't avoid the fact that he has shut down the government, and blocked the paychecks of 800,000 American workers, because he and his political base want an immoral, ineffective border wall.

American businesses need us to fund more customs officers at our ports to speed up the flow of commerce &amp; travel. Wasting money on Trump's border wall would mean no funding to hire those officers. That would force real economic costs on U.S. businesses, and we CANNOT allow that.
Funding Trump's border wall would keep us from funding critical national security priorities, including protecting America against actions by nations like Russia &amp; China. For example, we MUST procure a new heavy icebreaker so we can protect our vital Arctic security interests.

Wondering what the #TrumpShutdown of government means for Americans?  Read this quick explainer. https://t.co/jk2vFqTiyI
DON'T FORGET: Donald Trump claimed the #TrumpShutdown. On Dec. 11, he said: “I am proud to shut down the government…I will take the mantle. I will be the one to shut it down. I’m not going to blame you for it.” He can’t escape responsibility for it now.
Donald Trump has forced this shutdown because he wants to spend billions on an immoral, expensive, and ineffective border wall. America needs him to step up and demonstrate the responsibility his position demands. I call on him to stand with Democrats to end the #TrumpShutdown.
Very pleased the Supreme Court upheld the block against Trump’s asylum ban. His ban deserves to be roundly defeated — it totally goes against America’s history of providing humanitarian relief to vulnerable individuals fleeing violence and persecution. https://t.co/17yVZDhL87
Republicans have failed to govern once again. They are forcing Americans to pay for a wall, and they are willing to shut down the government to do so. We have many more urgent homeland security needs than this trophy for President Trump. https://t.co/cfyH9D8Lvp
When Democrats assume leadership of the House next month, we must fight to spend Homeland Security funds responsibly, limit funding for harmful Trump immigration policies, and conduct strict oversight of the Department of Homeland Security.
As the top Democrat on the House DHS Approps Subcommittee, I will keep fighting for policies that keep our country safe.  We cannot afford to waste money on Trump’s immoral, ineffective, and expensive border wall, especially when there are so many genuine DHS needs we must fund.
Republican leadership has failed to govern. By choosing to pursue a second CR instead of passing appropriations bills that truly meet our nation’s needs, Republicans have failed to provide government agencies with the certainty they need to serve the American people.

Donald Trump is desperate to distract you from Republicans' plan to rip away your preexisting condition protections, so he's pushing an agenda of fear, division, and hatred. But that doesn't change the fact that Republicans will rip away your preexisting condition protections.
NO president can rip out parts of the U.S. Constitution that they don't like. #BirthrightCitizenship is a constitutional right. Donald Trump can't change that truth, no matter how much he wants to. He’s a president, not a king. https://t.co/eQ7Ywx3lFg

The Trump Admin is further traumatizing migrant children by stealing them away in the middle of the night to a tent city where they get little education or legal aid. Children should be treated with sensitive loving care. Tragically, the Admin is doing the exact opposite. https://t.co/90eTFD11t2

We must have an FBI investigation of the allegations against Judge Kavanaugh. The Senate has no business rushing to a vote, especially after the fully credible testimony Dr. Ford gave yesterday. Why don't Republicans want a full investigation? What are they afraid it would find?
Make no mistake: After Dr. Ford's 100% credible testimony, voting for Judge Kavanaugh—especially without a full FBI investigation—sends a message to assault survivors that they should stay quiet, and gives comfort to assaulters everywhere. Shame on any senator who supports him.
I celebrated 228 years of the #CoastGuard at a Capitol Hill event with @ComdtUSCG Schultz and others. As top Democrat on the House subcommittee that funds the @USCG, I'll keep working to make sure that our Coast Guard has the resources it needs to help protect America. https://t.co/Nq0xSaDdXP

I stood shoulder to shoulder with fellow @HouseDemocrats to affirm that #IBelieveDrFord and #BelieveSurvivors. It's simply shameful that the GOP won't even call for an FBI investigation of the allegations against Judge Kavanaugh. https://t.co/CWr9fZ1HOs

No matter where we come from, what we look like, how we worship, or who we love, we all have the same rights and freedoms. We all have dignity. We are all worthy of respect. And we cannot allow white supremacists to succeed in spreading hate and fear throughout our great country.
As we mourn Heather Heyer and the two state troopers who were killed on that tragic weekend in #Charlottesville, let us honor their memories by resolving to build a kinder, more loving America, and to stand against intolerance and discrimination in all its forms.
One year ago, the nation watched in horror as white supremacists brought their bigotry to #Charlottesville &amp; turned the city's streets into a place of deadly violence. The white supremacists' hatred &amp; cruelty stood in stark contrast to our country's ideals of equality &amp; justice.
Putting immigrant families in detention is inhumane &amp; costs billions. That’s why I co-led an amdt added to the DHS Approps bill reinstating the Family Case Management Program ended by Trump &amp; ICE. The program's daily cost is just $36 per family &amp; 100% show up for court hearings!

We must not rest until the Trump Admin has reunited every immigrant family it has forcibly separated. Sadly, for the rest of their lives, these families will live with the scars of this trauma. Shame on you, Mr. President, for forcing this pain on these children and families.
And what about the parents who have been deported from the U.S. without their children?!? How long will they have to wait to be reunited with their kids? They don’t know, and we don’t know, and the Trump Admin doesn’t know.
Spoke at a press event about today's court-ordered deadline for the Trump Admin to reunite all the immigrant families it cruelly ripped apart. Tragically, the Admin didn’t keep track of where the kids &amp; parents were relocated, and had absolutely no plan to reunify these families. https://t.co/TEfKCk5KbY

Sadly, the Approps Cmte voted down my amdt to provide $750 million for #PolarIcebreakers, paid for by reducing the bill’s unjustifiable #BorderWall funding.

We saw an #immigrant mother who came to America to escape an abusive husband, and was separated from her son for two and a half months. During those months, they only spoke three times. How can our government think that a mother fleeing abuse should be torn away from her son?
I was so moved by the stories of the #ImmigrantFamilies we saw at #PortIsabel Detention Center. One father was reunited with his 13-year-old son -- they had fled to America because the son was being recruited to join gangs in their home country.
At #ICE's #PortIsabel Detention Center, we watched the emotional reunions of families who had been torn apart by our government. To see these separated parents and children finally reunited was a crushing reminder that they NEVER should have been separated in the first place. https://t.co/39k4YocQw3
We heard from #immigrant moms today about the heartbreak &amp; terror of being separated from their kids without warning &amp; without any knowledge of where their kids were, or whether they'd ever be reunited. Some were told they'd never see their kids again. I can't imagine their pain.
It was incredibly irresponsible of Republicans to sabotage the lifesaving #AffordableCareAct. Now, their actions are driving up @CoveredCA premiums.

If an #immigrant child is otherwise alone, they should be allowed to be with other family members; family is family.

Inside this #BorderPatrol processing center in #McAllen, I spoke with a grandmother who had been separated from her 7-year-old granddaughter. The grandmother was terrified -- she didn't know where her granddaughter was. https://t.co/AmyhxPxG2f

Trump made the #ZeroHumanity decision to tear immigrant families apart. Now he won't transport separated kids unless the sponsors pay. That's appalling. Families shouldn't pay for Trump's cruelty. Trump has a moral obligation to waive the fee, as was done by the previous Admin.
It's outrageous that Trump won't release the children he separated from their parents unless sponsors pay hundreds or thousands of dollars to transport the children and an escort. Imagine locking a child away from a loving family because the family can't afford to transport them.

Families are escaping horrors in their homeland and coming to America so that they can simply stay alive.  No amount of fearmongering by Jeff Sessions can distract from that central truth.
The administration is not serious about fixing our broken immigration system if they continue to ignore the plight of the men, women, and children seeking asylum in our country.
Jeff Sessions can throw around all the mischaracterizations and misinformation he wants, but he won't distract our focus from the fact that the administration’s policies are tearing innocent children from their parents.

It is impossible to understand how President Trump can ignore the pain he is causing the children separated from their parents.  And it is completely unacceptable that he now proposes to keep immigrant families together, but in detention with no certain end in sight.
The president’s new executive order does nothing to reunite the immigrant children who have been torn away from their parents. Nor is there any effort on the president’s agenda to help address the damage that is already done to these children who have been separated.
According to @AmerAcadPeds, the trauma children face when separated from their parents is unimaginable and often irreversible. Toxic stress can permanently change the architecture of a child's brain, and affect their health and their ability to succeed academically.

While Trump says he’s ending his cruel separation of families, his new executive order regrettably replaces one immoral policy with others, including the indefinite detention of women and children. We must continue to fight against POTUS’s inhumane and un-American policies.

When will Republican leaders have the courage to defend these innocent immigrant children from the Trump Administration's cruel abuse?  I urge Republicans to join me and my fellow Democrats to protect these children.
America has always been a leader and a beacon of hope and moral authority for the rest of the world. Yet immigrant children as young as two years old are tragically suffering at our country's hands.
I've been heartsick over reports of young immigrant children crying out for the parents who are no longer by their side. These children do not understand the Trump Administration’s xenophobic immigration policies. They simply yearn for their parents’ love and protection.
Today, I joined House colleagues for a press event condemning the Trump Admin for their despicable separation of immigrant children from their parents at our border. Tearing apart these families inflicts inhumane trauma on the children that is nothing short of child abuse. https://t.co/6YT7KnBMhH

As ranking member of the DHS Appropriations Subcommittee, I say the president owes Puerto Ricans and all Americans an honest and comprehensive report of the death and destruction that Hurricane Maria wreaked on Puerto Rico, and the total failure to protect this American island. https://t.co/BAM1m363qJ
Outraged by the shocking new estimate that Hurricane Maria killed more than 4600 of our fellow Americans in Puerto Rico. My deepest sympathies are with the victims and their loved ones. The president owes us a full accounting of the utterly inadequate response to this disaster. https://t.co/BAM1m363qJ

With the Trump Administration tearing apart immigrant families, it's vital that we pass new legislation to help #KeepFamiliesTogether. That's why I’ve reintroduced the #HelpSeparatedFamilies Act (https://t.co/hXX45lois9) and #HELPSeparatedChildren Act (https://t.co/QCNKVbafDK).
For the Trump Administration to *lose track* of immigrant children is unconscionable and utterly terrifying. #WhereAreTheChildren https://t.co/XCQF3cJvds

If we have any decency, we must work to reduce the pain caused to #children by this administration’s draconian #immigration reforms.  Our #HELPSeparatedChildren Act is a critical part of that effort.
As we fight to pass the #HELPSeparatedChildren Act, we must also keep fighting for a comprehensive #immigration reform package that treats #children and families humanely while keeping our border secure.
We need the #HELPSeparatedChildren Act because #children have been abandoned at home or at school after their parents’ detention, often without information about their parents’ location and without adequate arrangements for their care. That is totally unacceptable.
I'm reintroducing the #HELPSeparatedChildren Act with @SenTinaSmith so we can create new tools to help protect minor #children from trauma and permanent separation from their parents when their parents are arrested or detained by U.S. #immigration officials.
As the Trump Admin accelerates its cruel efforts to tear apart #ImmigrantFamilies at the border, it's never been more critical for us to protect the safety of the #children in these families. That's why I'm reintroducing the #HELPSeparatedChildren Act: https://t.co/QCNKVbafDK

We must pass Rep. @NydiaVelazquez’s American Promise Act, so individuals who have lived in the U.S. under #TPS for at least three years who have met all the security requirements can stay in America and pursue a path to naturalization.
We should be keeping families together, not ripping parents from their U.S.-born children.  We should be strengthening our communities and businesses, not weakening them by removing hardworking #TPS holders who love this country.
The Department of Homeland Security is utterly wrong to terminate #TemporaryProtectedStatus for 57,000 #Hondurans, many of whom have made America their home for many years.  I condemn #DHS's cruel announcement in the strongest terms. https://t.co/X6IpIa4Yyu

I hope my colleagues across the aisle will work with us to develop a sensible and fact-based approach to securing our border while treating #immigrants with compassion.
As we work to address #BorderSecurity, we must ensure that any plan we enact is humane, effective, and fiscally responsible — and it is clear that a 3,000-mile wall is not the answer.
Had a deeply informative visit to the U.S.-Mexico border with @RepPeteAguilar. As the top Democrat on House #HomelandSecurity Appropriations, seeing the border firsthand gives me a stronger sense of the realities we face as we set #DHS funding priorities for the years to come. https://t.co/LrfF3aRnss

The #EqualPay and #MeToo fights are linked together! In workplaces where sexual harassment is not addressed, women may feel less empowered to negotiate salaries and raises. That depresses their long-term earnings and professional advancement. #EqualPayDay
This #EqualPayDay, let’s remember there are many ways America can close the #WageGap. I’m fighting in Congress for the #PaycheckFairnessAct, #PaidSickDays, #PaidLeave, affordable #ChildCare, #RaiseTheWage, and more!
At the current rate, women won't win #EqualPay until 2059. For many women of color, equal pay is even farther away: Black women will wait until 2124, and Latinas will wait until 2233. This #EqualPayDay, let’s recommit to closing the #WageGap for ALL. https://t.co/mMapbJ5t1g
The average woman working full-time has to wait until April 10 to earn what a man earned by the end of the year before. But many women have to wait even longer. Latinas must work until November 1 to match the past year's average salary for a white man! #EqualPayDay https://t.co/P6zCJSQp6v
It is appalling that in 2018, women working full-time earn just 80 cents for each dollar earned by men -- and for many women of color, the gap is even wider. Women need equal pay for equal work, and they need it NOW. #EqualPayDay https://t.co/6xAzHY5T2p

If the president wants to deploy the National Guard, he owes us all some straightforward answers about how this deployment will be funded, how many troops will be deployed, what their precise mission will be, and how long it will last.

The House of Representatives has held 43 moments of silence to remember victims of mass shootings, and has passed ZERO bills to prevent assault weapons sales. Enough is enough. Time to act. #EndGunViolence
Americans want action to #EndGunViolence. In fact, 97% of gun owners want to see Congress require background checks for all gun buyers. When will @HouseGOP let us act?

As the #ACA turns eight years old, its future is still in danger. We cannot let the Trump Administration sabotage and dismantle this lifesaving program. We must fight to protect and improve the ACA, and do all we can to strengthen our nation’s health care system. #ProtectOurCare
Eight years ago today, the #AffordableCareAct was signed into law! I am so proud to have voted for this historic and successful legislation. Thanks to the #ACA, families in CA and across the nation are protected from high medical costs that would otherwise be paid out of pocket.

A worker earning the $7.25/hour minimum wage must work an extra eight weeks just to take home the same pay she did in 2009! This burden falls heavily on women and people of color, who are disproportionately likely to work in low-wage jobs. Enough is enough – let's #RaiseTheWage!
The Trump Admin has worked hard to line the pockets of millionaires, billionaires, &amp; corporations, but won’t consider raising our nation’s woefully inadequate minimum wage. Instead, they’re standing by as America’s minimum wage workers fall further &amp; further behind. #RaiseTheWage https://t.co/QH4Fv6mnUx

Immigrants have always played a crucial role in making California the great state that it is.  We must treat them with decency, not subject them to intimidation from the federal government.

Aggressive @ICEgov enforcement has increasingly led to the arrests of individuals who pose no threat to our country or our communities, and who have called the U.S. home for many years or even decades.  We should not be tearing them away from their families and communities.

The bonds of family are fundamental to American life, and #DHS should work to keep families together and ensure they are treated humanely.
Many #immigrant families come to America out of desperation to survive. They already carry emotional, mental, &amp; physical scars from leaving their homes &amp; loved ones, &amp; facing dangers on their way to the U.S. It is simply wrong to separate these families once they are in America.

Main takeaway from #AYearOfTrump? The only major bill passed by the GOP is a tax plan that raises taxes on the middle class in order to hand massive tax breaks to corporations and the wealthiest 1%.
A year after Trump introduced his first #MuslimBan, we're still battling hateful efforts to keep people out of the US based on their religion &amp; nation of origin. Let's have sensible, fact-based travel &amp; immigration policies that keep America safe while upholding American values.
Today, on International Holocaust Remembrance Day, we honor the memory of the Holocaust's victims, including the 6 million Jews who perished. Let us unite in saying #NeverAgain, and rededicate ourselves to doing all we can to eradicate genocide.

In the midst of this awful Trump proposal, our mission remains clear. We must #ProtectDreamers, and do so without violating our core values. Our bipartisan, bicameral #DreamAct shows we can reach a solution that satisfies both Democrats and Republicans.
If Trump offers a reasonable compromise on immigration, I will listen. But he wants to spend tens of billions on a wall, gut our family migration system, end diversity visas, and trash our asylum laws. That is not a compromise.
Donald Trump proposes to ransom the futures of #Dreamers and is demanding a set of hard-line immigration policies in return. He has not offered a serious immigration proposal. He has only offered an affront to common sense and decency.  https://t.co/E8nuVxO8p0

I opposed today's continuing resolution because we need to vote on permanent solutions on the urgent issues facing our nation, including community health clinics, opioid addiction, Dream, and worker pensions, among others.
As a member of the Appropriations Committee, and as an original #DreamAct author, I believe we must act NOW! We can’t keep kicking the can down the road on difficult decisions about government spending, and we can’t leave #Dreamers living in fear and uncertainty.
Some of my Senate colleagues voted for the CR because Sen. McConnell promised to take up legislation by Feb. 8 to keep our government running &amp; address the plight of #Dreamers. But I am deeply skeptical. Sen. McConnell makes a lot of promises that he fails to keep.
Republicans control the House, Senate, and White House. Yet despite their full control of government, they are no closer to passing the spending bills that support programs and services important to America's families &amp; military than they were 4 months ago.
This CR kicks the can down the road for the fourth time this fiscal year. Governing by repeated CRs leaves federal agencies such as our Defense Dept. unable to plan for the future or begin new initiatives. That undermines our nat'l security &amp; leaves our homeland more vulnerable.
I opposed today's so-called "deal" on a 3-week continuing resolution. It does not get us any closer to a bipartisan budget agreement that enables us to finish our work on the FY 2018 approps bills, and it does not give us any meaningful certainty about a deal for the #Dreamers.

It’s fitting, and sadly not surprising, that the one-year anniversary of @realDonaldTrump’s inauguration is also the first day of the GOP’s #TrumpShutdown. #AYearOfTrump
As the #TrumpShutdown continues, Democrats will keep doing our jobs and push for real action for Dreamers, veterans, children, workers, seniors, communities ravaged by opioids, and families worried about how Trump's shutdown impacts them.
We need the Republicans who control the House and Senate to demonstrate leadership, end the #TrumpShutdown, pass the #DreamActNOW, and find common ground to meet the needs of the American people.
President Trump repealed #DACA and created a crisis for the millions of #Dreamers living in this country, yet he and congressional Republicans refuse to negotiate in good faith on a permanent solution.

I kicked off #MLKDay weekend with other public officials calling out the damaging effects the #GOPTaxScam will have on communities nationwide. 		But this fight isn’t over. RETWEET if you are in it for the long haul. https://t.co/y3ql2t3hKC
Glad to be at #SouthLA's Fremont High for today's #MLKDayOfService with @CityYear, @AmeriCorps, @Disney VoluntEARS, and community volunteers! Had a great time helping to paint the school with college logos and murals promoting STEAM education and school pride. #CYMLK #MLKDay https://t.co/UkhV8PpEYs
As a fighter for civil rights, voting rights, peace, and an end to poverty, Dr. King faced down forces of bigotry and power, and he pointed our way toward a brighter future. On this #MLKDay, we recommit to hastening that brighter future for every man, woman, and child.
America owes an eternal debt to the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., and his fearless efforts to advance the cause of human dignity for all of God’s children. 50 years after his passing, his mission guides us still. #MLKDay https://t.co/iatgQ4S7W0

Joined other LA leaders to speak out against the #GOPTaxScam. Their tax plan is a sham &amp; tremendous windfall for the wealthiest 1% and large corporations at the expense of our hard-working families. Trickle-down economics hasn’t worked before, and it won’t work now! https://t.co/hjA8MaMEcc

As #MLKDay approaches, Donald Trump’s bigotry stands in stark contrast to Dr. King’s message of equality, justice, and brotherhood. America deserves better than this intolerant president. https://t.co/qEz3TPenYo
Today is the anniversary of the 2010 Haiti earthquake. The resilience and resolve that Haitians have shown during the recovery effort continues to inspire the world. To our Haitian brothers and sisters, I say: the American people stand with you.
Donald Trump's comments disgrace our nation's rich tradition of diversity. This president doesn't speak for America. He speaks for everything America fights to abandon. https://t.co/pXKByBFJpR

I strongly condemn DHS’s decision to terminate #TPS for #Salvadorans.

Appalled by this report that Trump wants to waste $18 billion of taxpayer money on an ill-considered border wall. As the top Democrat on DHS Approps, I urge the administration to join us in funding real solutions to keep Americans safe. The wall isn’t a solution, it’s a slogan. https://t.co/eoSCLZbcJO

The @HouseGOP’s complete disregard for the middle class is on full display today. It's very simple: the #GOPTaxScam puts #BillionairesFirst and leaves the middle class behind.
Today's House revote on the #GOPTaxScam shows yet again how hastily prepared their bill has been.  How many errors and hidden corporate giveaways are lurking in its pages?  Americans deserve #ABetterDeal than this disastrous tax bill. https://t.co/eyaeDnMIPc
Linked arms with House colleagues for a walk down the #NationalMall to meet with visiting #Dreamers. It is long past time for Congress to pass my #DreamAct and give Dreamers a chance to keep contributing to America. Hold a vote, @SpeakerRyan, and let's pass the #DreamActNow! https://t.co/Y3y2kS3hOe
I stand with my fellow Democrats in support of #ABetterDeal for American families. We need real, bipartisan tax reform that puts the middle class first!
The #GOPTaxScam repeals the individual health care mandate. That repeal will hike health premiums and leave 13 million uninsured.
The #GOPTaxScam explodes the deficit by $1.5 trillion -- and the GOP will use that deficit to justify further cutting Medicare and Medicaid.
The #GOPTaxScam raises taxes on 86 million middle class families. It gives 83% of its tax cuts to the wealthiest 1% and gives a new tax break to corporations shipping American jobs overseas.
Glad to stand with @NancyPelosi, @HouseDemocrats, @AdyBarkan, @Sr_Simone, &amp; more in opposing the #GOPTaxScam!  I will vote NO on this destructive, regressive bill. https://t.co/NG5fevs09R

#StudentLoan debt is out of control in this country. #GOPTaxScam eliminates the student loan interest deduction &amp; makes it harder to repay for the record number of #Latinos enrolling in universities. The end of the tuition deduction will make college unattainable for Latinos.
In 2015, the #ChildTaxCredit kept nearly 1 million #Latinos out of poverty. The #GOPTaxScam would make hard-working families ineligible for this credit, pushing hundreds of thousands of families into poverty.
#GOPTaxScam pays for tax cuts for the richest by making massive spending cuts to key programs that help our 40th District families make ends meet, stay healthy, put food on the table, and keep a roof over their heads.

Trump's #DACA decision was so shameful that he didn't even have the courage to make the announcement himself. Pathetic!
My bipartisan #DREAMAct w/Rep. @RosLehtinen would let US-raised immigrant youth earn lawful permanent residence &amp; US citizenship.
I will continue fighting in Congress to pass legislation that will permanently protect #DACA recipients before the six months expire.
America is built in large part by contributions, innovations, &amp; inventions of immigrants. Trump's action against #DACA only weakens the US.
Our country needs young #DACA recipients and their talents more than ever to strengthen our economy and our society. #DefendDACA
Trump ending #DACA in 6 months is outrageous. Heartbreaking day for the US &amp; the bright young DACA recipients who know no home but America.

Led the House effort to strip $1.6 billion in #BorderWall funding from the spending bill. We need that money for higher security priorities! https://t.co/bl273c1nZG
In spite of the president’s assurances, Mexico is not paying for this wall. The American taxpayer is. My motion would have prevented that.
Democrats won't support taxpayers funding an ill-conceived #BorderWall that has more to do with a campaign promise than #HomelandSecurity.
For years or even decades, the vast majority of U.S. undocumented #immigrants have called America home, paid taxes, and worked hard.
We will never be able to address our #immigration challenges by treating the millions of undocumented people in America as criminals.
A #BorderWall won't solve our #immigration challenges. We need comprehensive immigration reform that protects America &amp; our values.
Instead of spending $1.6 billion on a #BorderWall, we could invest in scanning tech &amp; Customs officers to intercept drugs entering the US!
Instead of spending $1.6 billion on a #BorderWall, we could buy two heavy #CoastGuard icebreakers &amp; protect US Arctic interests from Russia!
Trump's wrong: Mexico won't pay for the #BorderWall. US taxpayers will pay for it. Let's not put them on the hook by passing wall funding.
I introduced a motion to remove the $1.6 billion of #BorderWall funding from the spending bill so we can invest it in vital #DHS needs!
