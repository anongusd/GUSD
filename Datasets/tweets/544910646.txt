@srb1mm @SenatorSinema What an uneducated comment!  The suffragettes tireless vocal protest is why women won the "right" to vote. It was homage to those women that the "elected by vote" women were indeed showing unity. Suffragettes were not intimidated or wrong in their demand for equality! #ERAnow

@ProudResister @nytimes @maggieNYT @realDonaldTrump Right. Why don't they just say "looking like a clown with white circles around his eyes Trump took the podium." Haha
@syx_op @nytimes Did not appear that she was not cooperating. They appeared to come out her with force instigating a defensive reaction. Guarding her pregnancy &amp; child.  There is a right way and this was not it. It entails listening as well as ordering.
@syx_op @nytimes She was not exhibiting or involved in any violent behavior. Why would you not address the situation with calm?
@nytimes Poor training. Jump to a physical altercation when none was needed. Talking could have resolved this conflict. Instead they dramatized a 5 year old child and endangered a pregnant woman
@leahmcelrath Very bad optics when dealing with concerned family members. Administration at this prison needs to review why this heat shutdown happened, how they dealt with the conditions, why no contingency plan &amp; how they handle family concerns. @CoryBooker @SenSchumer @AOC

@SaarduLady I don't think it is the time for caving and giving up pieces. That approach has allowed for the chipping away at abortion rights and access.  It's not just abortion it is the Right to take ownership of our decisions, and having an abortion based on medical facts.
@SaarduLady One stupid man ... Abortion has always been the dividing line with Republicans. They have projected that stance on Democrats but that is false. It has been their true cause to control a woman's body &amp; everything else. Just look at Pence &amp; McConnell.  Yes they will use Northam.
@brock2441 @NYjusticeleague That's why contingency plans should exist. Because you can't just let them go home.
@brock2441 @NYjusticeleague Obviously  I don't know the exact situation. I am hoping after this there will be better contingencies put into place. In the meantime it seems they dragged their feet until the public out cry.
@SaarduLady What I would argue is that I don't want you or any govt to make that decision for a woman on their behalf. You are dismissing women &amp; doctors as uncapable of making that difficult choice.
@SaarduLady I can understand your stance on abortion. I do not support taking away the right to choose. There are many reasons for an abortion and I will not argue the pro or con.
@brock2441 @NYjusticeleague @RashidaTlaib I understand that but they are responsible for how many lives? Contingency plans by a Federal Agency is absolutely crucial. Too many unseen potential problems in a jail to ignore. Did they not meet the standards for a crisis, was it mismanagement, is there no oversight?
@funder Lying to the public gets you crazy folks in red hats. Lying to Congress or FBI gets you a jail cell. Trump fear having to speak with accountability.
@brock2441 @NYjusticeleague It's taking too long to remedy. These things should have contingencies in place.
@WhiskeyJames1 @NYjusticeleague @RashidaTlaib This is healthcare now. Read some of the stories of people dying because they can't afford meds or care.
@GossweilerChris @NYjusticeleague @RashidaTlaib There are folks helping the homeless. Not enough!! but when it comes to suffering it can't be whataboutisms it has to be both. All should receive help.
@MyLiberty2020 @SaarduLady @NYjusticeleague @RashidaTlaib @NYCMayor @nycemergencymgt Help both. Shouldn't be one over the other. Once we start that game we all lose.
@brock2441 @NYjusticeleague @RashidaTlaib Sounds like an excuse and not a remedy.
@NYjusticeleague @RashidaTlaib Federal prisons have an obligation to this country and the inmates to fix this now.

@DickDurbin Trump doesn't want security at the southern border. He wants big contracts, a money drain, a govt land grab and a way to keep the govt shut.	He is the definition of UNFIT. Work on Immigration &amp;border security AFTER govt is back up and Federal Workers are being paid!
@acbrackin @SenDougJones @TheDemocrats No. Wall does not equal security even the Repubs know that, its a Rally cry for Trump supporters. Includibg..Who is going to pay.... Mexico..Who?..Mexico.  Just lies from a Con Man. Dems gave lots of $ for real security &amp; better Immigration policy. This is the face of hate.

@Lucy2300090 @FoxNewsSunday @LindseyGrahamSC Once a President he isn't a private mogul he  is now a public servant. Trump's statement below.	“I’m under a routine audit and it'll be released, and as soon as the audit is finished it will be released." Waiting .. transparency should help his stand. Right?
@Lucy2300090 @FoxNewsSunday @LindseyGrahamSC No. No. No.  "He once took notes from his interpreter and ordered the linguist to stay silent, after a 2017 meeting with Putin in Hamburg, Germany"	Trump and Putin met privately for two hours, without aides or note-takers, accompanied only by their respective interpreters.
@Lucy2300090 This beyond politics.
@Lucy2300090 @FoxNewsSunday @LindseyGrahamSC More like seriously scary? Don't you question why a sitting President would meet alone with Putin and then take &amp; destroy the translaters notes?

@elianayjohnson @LindseyGrahamSC @seanhannity 2 yrs of vulgarity, lies, calls of racism, &amp; attacks on citizens is not whitewashed by 9 minutes on PrimeTime. Not Presidential.

@thomasarchitect @Well_Regulated_ There is no doubt there are stories with positive outcomes. They occur  much less frequently than the "accidents" or "anger" incidents  that @Well_Regulated_ posts.

@michaelkruse @PeterWehner @PhilipRucker Nuttier than a fruitcake (timely phrase bonus point)
@tomkozakATL @MikeLevinCA No excuses.
@B52Malmet Definitely a problem.  Solutions?
@Well_Regulated_ A very responsible gun owner. How do you NOT know your gun went off and shot somebody?   Along with the background checks there should be a personality, drug &amp; alcohol, &amp; intelligence testing.
@oothoon13 @DanJBalkwill @dahliabloom @siano2020 Nobody said sinking, not looking for a "Different" Trump. But being quiet and respectful has lead us to shock over how pervasive the #metoo movement is, I don't think we will quietly respectfully allow ourselves to be"stalked" on debates floors or in life now.  Vote the GOP out.
@abc15 Unbelievably sad.
@Well_Regulated_ Without the gun this would have probably remained an altercation, with the gun this became a murder.
@Well_Regulated_ Guns are putting our children in jeopardy . Until you have a solution to man's ability to control his/her anger,  guns have no place walking around in our society. Not in our schools, not in our drug stores, not in our bars, and not on our highways.
@briantylercohen @B52Malmet #GOP @SenateMajorityL  this man needs some mental health intervention. He is embarrassing to himself and this country. GOP you have made a mockery of the highest office in America. Vote GOP out!!
@AllDogsRule @RBReich I didn't say intentionally. You did.   I do think better care should be provided so children are not dying at the border. And yes I think lack of care  is based on whom they are. I don't want to see another child die! Our goal should be zero.
@AllDogsRule @RBReich The disease we are dealing with is much more insidious. It is reducing the value of human life because the person wasn't born in the same place as you and may not look like you or may worship differently then you. A child lost their life. Some respect here please.
@AllDogsRule @RBReich You don't know that it wasn't. That is not the care I expect for my child or received. Is this what you have experienced for yours? Stupid scare tactics-bringing disease. If that were true wouldn't you expect our healthcare professionals would have been prepared for this disease
@brycetache Bryce you are an excellent cheerleader for all the good we can accomplish. Thank you. &amp; Merry Christmas-Happy Healthy New Year to you ,your family, and all those following you her on Twitter.
@alfranken Lovely family. Wishing you the best.  Happy New Year
@RBReich One child 's preventable death while in US custody at our borders is ONE too many. There is no justifying or tossing blame here. We are the monsters/boogeymen that scare children, women &amp; men. Not these innocent families with children that come to us for sanctuary and assistance

@TommyS_H @HillBeverlyhill Agree, it would be better if  Trump's divisive racist/misogynistic language turned them off instead of their 401k numbers. Remember there a quite a few Americans who just get by without having a toe in the 401k bucket. Need to rid us of like Trump minded folks.

@marcorubio @KellyannePolls NOPE Dems  won't Mexico was to pay this 5 Billion dollars. We don't need a Fence. Wall is not an effective Security Measure. Thx. We need real Border Security.  $5 billion could be better spent on homeless, VA housing &amp; benefits, clear water, &amp; education.

@connie_kasper @SenBlumenthal How many of the ones that don't turn down the job and you hire are still struggling? Some folks take advantage, but for many it is a way to make it thru until they don't need help. Many have other issues. We need to look up at the wealthy that don't pay their fair share.

@PhilipRucker @seungminkim @ericawerner @jdawsey1 Well now we know the real reason Chris Christie was called to the Whitehouse, give advise on shutting down services but still lying on a beach enjoying the day.
@littlemommy62 @MeetThePress @SenSchumer The folks that were involved in 9/11 were not Mexicans. Threats can come from any direction. Contraband can come from any direction. So you are saying you just don't like Mexicans and Central Americans, not really threats to the folks here in America?
@RBReich Immigration has made America - America. Nothing poorer or dirtier except the people that forget our history.
@tribelaw Their Motto - Do as Much Harm as possible, pocket some bucks, and laugh at all the less fortunate. Nice set of folks we have put in high places. Shame on us. VOTE THEM OUT
@OohMyNose @KLT_82 @KamalaHarris There was a time folks had insurance that WOULD NOT cover pregnancy. Now you think it is a given that women have that coverage. Don't take something for granted that assumption could be removed. I remember many couples having to pay for their babies deliveries. It aint cheap
@tsen66 @KamalaHarris It allowed my brother who was stuck in a horrible horrible job to leave it, after years of abuse at his employment. He had a pre-existing condition that he could not afford to be without health insurance.  Once Obamacare arrived it allowed him the freedom to seek a different job.
@CharmelCross @nytimes NUTS...
@WynneJGriffith @nytimes Not human.
@nytimes FYI - my disabled kid is in the GIFTED PROGRAM and smarter than those blonde piggy tailed girls and freckled faced boys. Knocking down the most vulnerable is disgusting and making it a Federal Policy is coming to an end. VOTE THEM OUT
@BluDragon8 @kcbuettner @RabbiShaina @nytimes She isn't qualified for human !!!
@nytimes Why are we taking away protection for these kids?!!! "minority students were receiving more suspensions &amp; tougher punishments than white students for the same or lesser offenses, while disabled students were too quickly being shunted into remedial or special-education programs."
@littlemommy62 @MeetThePress @SenSchumer Wall doesn't equal safety. That is just bull. If a wall is so important why aren't we building one at the Canadian border? Mines in the seas so we can protect our coasts? It's bull politics &amp;a waste of money
@thomaslmalone @MeetThePress @SenSchumer Sort of like that potato chip bowl that lights up and plays " I'm a little teapot" in seven languages. It looks useful but really its a.piece of junk that will wind up in the trash when nobody is playing attention.
@OregonJOBS2 My fake cat asked me to vote for the Dems. Go figure cats.
@washingtonpost Very Brave daughter. Sending love her way.
@akasparklybitch @Shakestweetz yes I would.
@mollylyons I looked up that TX statute number and it does not read anything like that. 	CHAPTER 2270.  PROHIBITION ON INVESTING PUBLIC MONEY IN CERTAIN INVESTMENTS		SUBCHAPTER A.  GENERAL PROVISIONS		Sec. 2270.0001.  DEFINITIONS.  In this chapter:	Searched for Israel - nothing popping. 	???
@RTuckerMiller @robertwolf32 @MalcolmNance @NewYorker @JeffreyToobin @RepAdamSchiff @AdamSchiff Although I agree transparencies on Dual Citizenship or giving it up when taking office should apply to Republicans, Democrats &amp; Independents. Trump still needs his finances looked at.
@RTuckerMiller @robertwolf32 @MalcolmNance @NewYorker @JeffreyToobin @RepAdamSchiff @AdamSchiff Well if conflict with Dual citizenship countries bothers you. Transparency of Trump's finances to rule out any conflicts should be a priority. Picking 1 Rep to single out when he is doing something you don't like, does not help your cause.
@RTuckerMiller @robertwolf32 @MalcolmNance @NewYorker @JeffreyToobin @RepAdamSchiff @AdamSchiff So if you feel that way does it mean you are Not American?  Americans are all evil? Not quite agreeing with you on that. Perfect - nope but not quite evil yet.
@RTuckerMiller @robertwolf32 @MalcolmNance @NewYorker @JeffreyToobin @RepAdamSchiff @AdamSchiff More transparency issue. Currently, there’s no disclosure requirement in U.S. law regarding dual citizenship when running for office, and nothing specific in conflict of interest rules when running for office as a dual citizen - Dems Share it and Republicans Don't ??? Sad Bad
@RTuckerMiller @robertwolf32 @MalcolmNance @NewYorker @JeffreyToobin @RepAdamSchiff @AdamSchiff And your list is missing all the Republicans ? Why _ You got an Agenda.... and you are lacking substance to give an accurate picture? Disappointing. Bye Bye
@RTuckerMiller @robertwolf32 @MalcolmNance @NewYorker @JeffreyToobin @RepAdamSchiff @AdamSchiff So why are you just point at one in your tweet?
@iheartchm @terri_suggs @MikeLevinCA @GOP Thank you I will.  I appreciate your reaching out to me.
@RTuckerMiller @robertwolf32 @MalcolmNance @NewYorker @JeffreyToobin @RepAdamSchiff @AdamSchiff Can you supply me with the full list of Senators &amp; Congress people that have dual citizenship and their party affiliation . I don't believe that Adam Schiff is the only one
@worldcitizen1st @mycroft_vii @Slone43414762 @abbygirl1028 @thedailybeast I havent heard of one utterance from Mueller that implies impartiality. The only one saying that is Trump.  Why wouldn't a sitting President want transparency. It would clear this all up in a heartbeat.  Hiding (right or wrong) indicates guilt.
@mycroft_vii @worldcitizen1st @Slone43414762 @abbygirl1028 @thedailybeast Well if you believe this - then releasing all information regarding Donald Trumps finances certainly could not hurt him.. He is a businessman. Let the numbers explain it all to us so we can understand exactly how businessmen do it.
@KeenaBron @ConnieSchultz @neeratanden Or any of the Republican Swine that have done nothing but ignored his behavior. Including the Republican Women.
@ezzd_1212 @zhaomemo @washingtonpost ouch.
@1dannywalker1 @robertwolf32 @NewYorker @JeffreyToobin @RepAdamSchiff @AdamSchiff @JeffreyTobin If you are a Trump supporter why aren't you shouting to Trump to Release the information prove Schiff &amp; them all wrong! Easiest way to make a fool out of them Right?
@robertwolf32 @NewYorker @JeffreyToobin @RepAdamSchiff @AdamSchiff About time. The President should be happy to oblige and provide transparency under the these allegations. Why wouldn't he be? unless he is guilty of something.
@lslerner @CottonCornell1 @WilbertMatt35 @yura_nother1 @washingtonpost l.s.l - the one called CottonCornell1 is not worth your time. Your speaking Truth is not going to make any difference here. Hoping he has no children.
I think James Wood's meaning is he is intimidated by these two women who are smart &amp; motivated. They both will work hard for the American people.  A New Day ! https://t.co/A5Df1iwuPp
@sistaresistaa @Pop_Harvey1 @JoeKingNow @_focus_on_now @MSNBC Agree about the hate. It's on the rise, well it's always been there, it's more out in the open and now the haters are more brazen in their behavior. Good news is that the ones that don't hate are not accepting it and stopped quietly looking away. We do need to speak up.
@Strandjunker @suzybwell @realDonaldTrump When you say it that way I almost feel bad for him..THEN I remember how destructive he is to the people he is supposed to serve.. how he lies, he cheats, how abusive he is, how he steals and I say put the bum in jail. Please
@Pop_Harvey1 @sistaresistaa @JoeKingNow @_focus_on_now @MSNBC Thank you for the apology. I have the same problem sometimes. Tweets are prone to get the blood boiling because of the length limitations. Knee jerk reactions. And haha opposing views. Golden Rule works here too.
@Pop_Harvey1 @sistaresistaa @JoeKingNow @_focus_on_now @MSNBC Pop Harvey I think you are the one that is lacking the desire to listen to the other side. Twisting it to sistaresistaa is exposing way too much anger. You found one note in a tweet and jumped. Missing the point completely. Have a great night.
@32photosMM @_SJPeace_ My hero too.  Love to that lady.
@CottonCornell1 @WilbertMatt35 @lslerner @yura_nother1 @washingtonpost So you are saying you are for beating kids and black dad's beat their children and better to have a black dad beat you then no Dad?  I think your reasoning is a bit screwed up on every level. There was a reason I blocked you earlier. I'll do again. Thx.
@lslerner @CottonCornell1 @WilbertMatt35 @yura_nother1 @washingtonpost Matt I can understand admiration for parents who want to keep their child safe from drugs, gangs &amp; crime. Abusing your child to save them is wrong and criminal. I believe there are better parenting options. I couldn't say I admired any parent that kicked the crap out of their kid
@JoeKingNow @sistaresistaa @Pop_Harvey1 @_focus_on_now @MSNBC And I doubt your walls will do that. They come thru check points and we only catch a fraction. They dig tunnels, they send by boat, and they drop by planes. Walls just don't do the job their image invokes. A barrier, a seal of protection. foolish
@WilbertMatt35 @lslerner @CottonCornell1 @yura_nother1 @washingtonpost Maybe your example needs to lose it's association to a locality.  That would remove the hint of bias it may inadvertently implied.
@WilbertMatt35 @lslerner @CottonCornell1 @yura_nother1 @washingtonpost It was a knee jerk reaction to what has been become a classic generalization. What somebody says when they mean something else. A very real code phrase. Assumptions shouldnt be made but politics &amp; culture has made us a divided people.
@washingtonpost Probably a very good thing. Makes him that more effective  at a very difficult task. Hard to throw insults his way. Just Respect for his efficiency. Perfect pick for his position.
@WilbertMatt35 @lslerner @CottonCornell1 @yura_nother1 @washingtonpost You brought up inner city but there are lots and lots of parents in rural communities that use a belt or stick. Child abuse has nothing to do with race or locality. It has to do with not having sufficient parenting skills, stressers, and sometimes just pure evil.
@JoeKingNow @sistaresistaa @Pop_Harvey1 @_focus_on_now @MSNBC Once again it has not been proven that a wall makes us secure. Security is not as simple as a barrier. It may become an expensive place to hang a sign. We can do better than that
@JoeKingNow @sistaresistaa @Pop_Harvey1 @_focus_on_now @MSNBC Your first two words "I say" seems not to win the argument for me. If open borders are the issue then you should be building 2 walls.  I think security is needed just not a wall.
@JoeKingNow @sistaresistaa @Pop_Harvey1 @_focus_on_now @MSNBC Opinion of where the risk is, open borders, that Republicans are shouting about would include Canada. 9/11 was not Mexicans. You say poor abused asylum seekers are the greatest risk. I differ on that opinion.
@MaryHill387 @MSNBC @NancyPelosi She said as she was leaving. Frustrated. Just like any parent having to deal with children all day. If you call that personal insults please review Trump's abudance of abusive tweets. She didn't have to go there but some exasperation needed release.
@barrybutler2008 @MSNBC Education, opportunity, respect, fairness in our judicial system, I don't know lots of ways to reduce those things that would benefit Americans. Not seeing a wall doing much there.
@JoeKingNow @sistaresistaa @Pop_Harvey1 @_focus_on_now @MSNBC So you say a Wall with Canada border too? Maybe some mines in the waters outside our shores. Is that going to make you feel safe? No. Security is not a wall.

@TomGlasnow @BrookeTony @BajanMbaku @washingtonpost Funny I don't think of her as a loser and I am not alone in thinking that way. She is just not the sworn in President, that would be Trump and him I definitely think of as a Loser.
@TomGlasnow @BrookeTony @BajanMbaku @washingtonpost She ran and won the popular vote. Without the electoral college she would be the United States President. She will always be relevant
@MrBlue111 @washingtonpost Ok I'll take it.  Thx #WAPO
@_SJPeace_ Nice voice. Cool to stand in the grass and just let yourself flow. I could have been good without the cows but that is just me.
@mj_lindquist @SilviaElenaFF @annkillion @JoaquinCastrotx I think you are wrong. They were picked up in a remote area 90 miles from Lordsburg and bused to Lordsburg. From Lordsburg she was airlifted to El Paso Tx. according to reports. I don't think they have a definite cause of death yet. Sad.
@mj_lindquist @SilviaElenaFF @annkillion @JoaquinCastrotx She was on a bus headed to Guadalajara? Where did she get on a bus heading there and with US officials? That sounds incorrect.
@ChrisInTheZoo @shaunking I don't know there are some folks that I would back 300% for the national stage that lost this last time.  Many Winners were first Losers. I would say it keeps them humble but we know that is never the case with politicians. Different audience than just their state???
@KinseyMilhone @shaunking @MaryMcDonnell10 @staceyabrams @GOP Defend with anger when you know you cheated. Sweet.
@ChrisInTheZoo @shaunking @staceyabrams When the GOP cheat we can't give up on some amazing leaders.
@JerryLHarriman @shaunking @Gisudaraz @staceyabrams So did Beto, when the GOP cheat we can't give up on some amazing leaders.
@KinseyMilhone @shaunking @MaryMcDonnell10 @staceyabrams GOP much.  Stacey Abrams is a winner she just got cheated.
@jonfavs Why read about it we are living it. Depressing.

@LKJCPA @itsJeffTiedrich Why would that make shooting yourself in the foot okay?, Problem is they don't realize they shot their own foot they just blame the guy sitting next to them. Frustration with DC is not a reason to ignore you are the one holding the gun.
@Dariela14282489 @MaureenRamsden2 @1cheri74 @SilviaElenaFF @JoaquinCastrotx So do you want to get rid of child protective services? Because they step in to protect children and then have a responsibility to do so once in their custody. And can be held accountable.
@mj_lindquist @SilviaElenaFF @annkillion @JoaquinCastrotx Once they are in US custody they are no longer traveling alone.
@carhartt886 @MilesMansMom @gueninj @SilviaElenaFF @MaddowBlog @JoaquinCastrotx She was in custody of govt officials who are required to report deaths, that makes this lying by omission. Besides truly disgusting.
@Johnso3B @GraemeCrews @JeffFlake Spelling for liberals is L I B E R A L S- now even slower for you. L  I   B   E  R  A   L  S - if you need help you can google the word for the accurate spelling.

@kapie9969 @Tricia61555980 @JeffFlake No it says the AZ people know crap when they see it.
@DeeEman2013 @JeffFlake He voted for Kavanaugh his service to the Republican Party is done, never there to represent AZ citizens.

@genome_editor @ChuckGrassley Drs are overpaid. Hospitals overcharge. Some transparency on fees.
@2arinkorpool @john_busbin @ChuckGrassley Overcharging is the  model of medicine in this country.
@codysimm @ChuckGrassley Fix overpriced medical services. No Dr is worth a couple hundred dollars or more for 10 minutes. Or better yet same hundreds of dollars for a PA not even a real Dr. Medicine should not be a money machine. Real prices. Posted prices.
@TheOnion And then does TJ Maxx add a 20% markup on that number to cover the lying that prospective employee gave on the application?
@HoarseWisperer A hug from my granddaughter.
@willmets1 @MissNyetTrump @AndyRC3001 I pay and pay and pay &amp; then one day ins company says you have xyz and we don't care... So they say do us all a favor and die. Oh do that at home. Don't dirty any sheets. Medical fees, pharma costs, hospital fees are ridiculously high. this is broken
@8bitrocket @MissNyetTrump Great tool those in wealth &amp; power have. Use the poor and weak to do harm to themselves. Instead of revolting against those truly responsible for bad policy.
@ProudResister @realDonaldTrump You must be too popular to ignore.
@TreyPollard_SC @benwikler @bruneski I hope this is true. Beware the devil you don't know.
@realDonaldTrump I don't hear you talking about the lower costs of medical care? You are clapping about taking away insurance from folks with pre existing conditions. You sir are disgusting.
@darrenhayes It happens.
@ThePlumLineGS We have a federal child welfare bureau that oversees State Agencies. Mission Statements like "We promote safe and healthy families and protect children and vulnerable adults from abuse,	neglect, and exploitation." Words &amp; not Responsibilities? Child  being held by US authorities.
@terri_suggs @MikeLevinCA @GOP Interesting - Thank you.  I am not sure these are the best fit but I will look into them more in depth.
@terri_suggs @MikeLevinCA @GOP Its not. I guess we will all be signing up for your Christian health sharing insurance - please post so that we contact them for this great coverage. Thx
@rachelgoodstein @wthomas9 @howyoudoing85 @NPR Interesting - Class system whereby the wealthy took advantage of the poor nothing new here in America. Thank you for that piece of history.
@mutxtiger @mcspocky Sorry - no offense. Just not an expert on the logic of any of this stuff.
@mutxtiger @mcspocky The logic is that insurance companies found pregnancy &amp; delivery expensive so they didn't like to pay. You had to get the insurance and be on it for a period of time before pregnancy coverage.  If you got a new job and wanted insurance &amp; were pregnant you could be denied.
@mutxtiger @mcspocky Why ask me - I believe no preexisting condition should exclude you from getting insurance but Before the Affordable Care Act, pregnancy was considered a pre-existing condition, and insurers frequently denied coverage because of it. Since we are going backwards??? I don't know ...
@wthomas9 @howyoudoing85 @NPR We are and we do but we need to believe we can change that. Not believing keeps folks from voting and defeats us before we start. Knowing good folks are out there makes us work all the harder to end that disgusting status quo from the past.
@wthomas9 @howyoudoing85 @NPR Agree.
@mcspocky Yes, they are monsters. They don't care. Not sure that group understands that pregnancy is a preexisting condition. OOPs.
@Lady_Star_Gem @fredslickrock @Goss30Goss @briantylercohen @B52Malmet @ChrisMurphyCT @TeamPelosi @ifindkarma @tarastrong @TheSWPrincess @TheLoyalO @TrinityResists Tears..
@J1100ISLITTTTT @benwikler @realDonaldTrump @kayleighmcenany This will affect you too. Almost anything can be preexisting condition. You Or your daughter, son, wife, husband, mother, father, sister, brother, best friend, girlfriend, nephew, niece, aunt Uncle...coming to your family too. Unless you aren't American
@realDonaldTrump You Mr President are a piece of Toilet paper on the shoes of the American people. You took away peeexisting coverage. We the people and there are millions and millions of us hold you 	&amp; the GOP responsible.
@howyoudoing85 @wthomas9 @NPR And some don't appreciate others lack of freedoms in this land. Being quiet and accepting less gets you just that - LESS.  I vote for perfect for all. Are we the worst- nope but we can be better.
@gratebluehill @crazydiamond_pf @SenWhitehouse Ok then stop lying. You are just looking for people to blame. I say blame yourself. Have a good evening.
@gratebluehill @crazydiamond_pf @SenWhitehouse Well many dont vote. That too is a problem.
@wthomas9 @howyoudoing85 @NPR Truth but not all in America are today...so that may be the cup 1/2 full.  We just need to remove the ones in government and stop electing these awful human beings. Educate..and not accept these attitudes any longer.
@gratebluehill @crazydiamond_pf @SenWhitehouse Relying solely on our politicians and elected officials can be quite  disappointing. Have you tried citizen activism. Sounds like you care. You can't change everything but you might change something. &amp; connect with other folks that care.
@gratebluehill @crazydiamond_pf @SenWhitehouse Sounds terrible. What are you doing to make it better?
@jechodelta @amyklobuchar Veterans want &amp; deserve good healthcare. So do all American citizens. Just because you were born with health issues you should be able to access good Affordable healthcare. Not be denied coverage. Same for survivors of cancer &amp; other pre existing conditions
@DickDurbin No Wall
@howyoudoing85 @NPR Talking GOP not America..#USA   read the thread.
@madmrgone @AlaneFarmer4 @MikeLevinCA Ha. Ok we leave the money laundering of Russian funds out. Instead NRA's lobbying for gun industry instead of just running your quoted gun safety classes for their membership.
@politico Just think how much better we would be doing environmentally with supportive government policy. Yes Climate change is real, Virginia.
@NPR Oh they showed they cared, just about all the wrong things. They care about keeping America a Racist, misogynistic, nontolerant land that blames the poor and rewards the wealthy.  Vote GOP out.
@madmrgone @AlaneFarmer4 @MikeLevinCA Was one of their purposes on paper. Now it is political incorrectness (Russian) and a gun in every hand mentality.

@simonhedlin @Ocasio2018 haha. So why isn't Trump gone. His bully behavior is totally out of bounds. An embarrassment to the American public. Disgraceful way of talking about women!! Promoting hate with his very fine Nazi's. Yup - @LindseyGrahamSC do your job and make #Trump gone.
@PhilipRucker The staff was down on their knees begging Trump - NOT Mick Mulvaney.. please please but once again Trump's gut won over the cries of thinking people.
@politico Insulting. Before leaving office he wants to insult Americans with a nod to white racism and the Irish for claiming Irish ancestral heritage.
@ProudResister @realDonaldTrump Tremendous
@DickDurbin So what cha all waiting for do just that?
@MrsP37071433 @LoriVassallo @Hobbit_Zombie @thehill Why do we do this? The humanitarian group No More Deaths has posted videos of border agents have destroyed the gallons of water their volunteers leave in the desert for dehydrated migrants. Not giving them water is inhumane.
@MrsP37071433 @LoriVassallo @Hobbit_Zombie @thehill Before the group left Antelope Wells by bus to be transferred to a border station, her father reported that she was ill and vomiting. By the time she arrived at the border station an hour-and-a-half later, she was not breathing.
If true it would be the GOP saying NO Means YES. When we all know No means No. AZ didn't Elect her!! And the voters don't want McSally.	Arizona Gov. Ducey likely to pick Martha McSally to replace Sen. Jon Kyl, sources say - CNNPolitics https://t.co/poJSPw44UH

@SpaceForceOne14 @KamalaHarris I don't agree with you, your cursing, or your crazy rant but I hope you never know suffering or need help from another. Peace.
@MrsP37071433 @Hobbit_Zombie @thehill If a child was suffering on your doorstep would you close the door. And watch them die. Or would you offer help and then worry about how she got there. This CHiLD was at our doorstep. If we do nothing we share in the responsibility.
@maziehirono Thank you. We have to do better than this. Having a seven year old child die on our doorstep when her death was preventable if shown kindness &amp; care is wrong. It's not who were or who we want to be.
@MrsP37071433 @Hobbit_Zombie @thehill So you are okay with this girl's death? Because I am not.
@KamalaHarris You would think with the fear of migrants bringing in "disease" that the CBP would have caught a little girl with a high fever and dehydration. Not caring about these people is not part of the job description, US expects better from those working with the migrants at our borders.

@Ocasio2018 Now if they would stop the massive buying thru Amazon and other online companies for everything.!!!  We have enough over packaging and delivery to doorstep one product at a time is wasteful . We need to do better. Green is not that business model.
@WilbertMatt35 @CottonCornell1 @yura_nother1 @lslerner @washingtonpost They needed help in dealing with their child no doubt about it. Beating crap out of them was not the right way. If I need 50 bucks for food.  I could steal or I can work. Both give the $, one is right,  one is wrong. Better tools out there then abuse.
@WilbertMatt35 @CottonCornell1 @yura_nother1 @lslerner @washingtonpost Fyi the discussion was taking a belt or a stick to a child. I call it abuse. Spank to cause pain or injury, (not talking call the authorities over a mild tap)also abuse. Parents can be given better tools but we have to stop defending their right to beat the sh$t out of their kids
@CottonCornell1 @yura_nother1 @lslerner @WilbertMatt35 @washingtonpost I have no need to get back to you, you are nobody. I have seen the abuse of folks hiding behind a Bible, those are my facts. Thx  I hope you find peace in this life.

@Ocasio2018 Truth. Nothing turns people off more than the lying self righteousness of crooks, con men, Republicans.
@todd_allen @realDonaldTrump Trump wants in on that deal.
@gamechanger1813 @realDonaldTrump @POTUS After tax dollars?
@realDonaldTrump No that would be taking the American people's money and misapplying it to your wall instead of services citizens do want
@Mikel_Jollett No. No Wall. Trump govt shut down because even Republicans think the idea of this wall is sh#t
@politico Don't think that is the same as Mexico paying. Sounds like absurd reasoning to take the funds from the American taxpayers

@sunthorn_ @Bash651 @tedcruz @TheDemocrats If those funds gained were going to build a wall why does the President need Congress to allocate 5billion  in the budget?

@funder Traitor.  Ouch, gotta hurt coming from an ex best buddy.
@CNNPolitics Not the reason Pelosi &amp; Dems won't give. American people do not want a wall or our government wasting our money on a wall. Per President Trump It wasn't going to cost us a damn thing. Mexico was going to fund it?? Right?
@TheOnion I think Trump has plans to correct this travesty. Go Trump - Go Coal
@Bash651 @tedcruz @TheDemocrats Republicans hold the Senate and House. Ask you ourselves why don't they have the votes? Mexico was supposed to pay not the American taxpayers(I would say citizens but Jared doesn't pay taxes)
@renato_mariotti Mitch McConnell we know that your knowledge of Trump's crimes make you complicit. Hiding behind the curtain will not work for you any longer. You sir are a threat to American democracy.
@RawStory @gtconway3d Yes
@playinreprise @DjRodgers1231 Imagine having to call people names to feel empowered or smart or justified.  Thx. Meaningless when it comes from a bully. Have a blessed day from all the people who don't prescribe to your hate.
@NPR Despicable
@trilingual1946 @NBCNews And probably has.
@LynneAvVer @NBCNews No only Schumer laughed. Pelosi was disgusted by his lack of civility and intelligence.
@ehkorth @CBarrett93 @NBCNews Trump should be more concerned about the 40000 citizens killed by guns in the  USA this year. Including children and folks in places of worship. What's he doing for sensible gun control...nothing.
@rubyhillsales @NBCNews No. He just maybe the slimest.
@KamalaHarris Wow. Staggering but I do know of young people that did just that. Suffered thru ..that is so wrong.
@DRCMJV @KamalaHarris Nope I didn't have to ask the guy had about 50 Trump stickers on his van. Those Vans are trending ..and impossible to miss
@mhartgerink1956 @KamalaHarris Wait..doesn't Donald hire illegals..Bedminster Golf Club of the Rich and Fancy.
@mspk7305 @KamalaHarris Or sell our elections and give away tax breaks to the 1% .. now your thinking!
@Mystagogue10 @KamalaHarris This is needless spending.Agree!
@GregBeam4 @KamalaHarris Wall? Is waste of money not much security there. Very little return for our buck.

@GregWal60332029 Lovely. Happy Holidays!
@fred_guttenberg An epidemic that our government is ignoring. While Flu kills about 12,000 Americans  &amp; up to 56,000, according to estimate from the Centers for Disease Control. Yet I see great lengths to protect citizens from Flu &amp; not guns. Change that please.	https://t.co/0y8W0FaN3C
@TomECaster @vazirabadi @annszipszky @Ocasio2018 When using sources one should not base an argument siting a known hate group. Kind of defeats you before you even start. Thx at least I understand its deeper than money it's hate and fear. Good bye.
@DRCMJV @KamalaHarris Yup a Trumpster's violent outburst of protectionism for a criminal President ran their car into me while tweeting. I know where is the justice?
@renato_mariotti @brycetache Orrin Hatch isn't it your job to care about upholding the law and our constitution?  Not doing your job now makes you a Complicit Traitor to his Country. We were founded against Tyranny, a President who is above the law is treasonous.
@Well_Regulated_ Surprised this doesn't happen more often. Brilliant. Luckily a young child in a nearby car wasn't struck by stray bullet.
Good try Senator Collins it does not change my belief in Dr Ford or Justice Kavanaugh's partisan conspiracy lying belligerence. You still should have voted NO. #metoo	Susan Collins feels 'vindication' after Kavanaugh Planned Parenthood vote - CNNPolitics https://t.co/AFXw6aJwIP
@mrfulton81 Wow. Fantastic news indeed.
@TheDemCoalition @funder Jared aren't you worried you might get invited to an embassy one day. Running with these folks might be dangerous.
@quilts4veterans @SenBlumenthal @PPFA How old were these girls? Doesn't MA have health or sex Ed in schools? If that young don't the parents need to consent?  Your statements raise so many questions?
@churderm @Ocasio2018 plasmodium
@quilts4veterans @SenBlumenthal @PPFA I know this is a point of contention. But wording is important. PP does not condone abortion as birth control option. But yes offers abortion options to those that choose it for a myriad of personal reasons.
@quilts4veterans @SenBlumenthal @PPFA Any procedure for a woman &amp;her body is a personal choice. I can not judge somebody for making any difficult choice. Neither would I condone another in forcing their opinion for or against. But options should be available. Safe options.
@quilts4veterans @SenBlumenthal @PPFA I have a difficult time believing that, yes they give the option. Maybe for some that would seem like pushing. I do not know MA laws regarding consent but PP is so under microscope they due diligence to comply.
@quilts4veterans @SenBlumenthal @PPFA Explain please what you know?  Any PP I have been too has never suggested abortion as a birth control method EVER.
@DanaScottLO @mollylyons @TheSWPrincess @RebelScumPixie @TrisResists @B52Malmet @JynErso_2017 @StormResist @1Jedi_Rey @EmmaFrostResist @Milliennial @chillibeanboy Me too.
@quilts4veterans @SenBlumenthal @PPFA I know. Not true. Have a very nice evening I wish you well.
@serdanovic Thank you? I still believe Dr Ford. Thank you. No I don't think I would say thank you to a man I believed lied, sexually assaulted another person, whose temperament was belligerent,  and then came up with a  bizarre conspiracy theory. Righto.
@TomECaster @vazirabadi @annszipszky @Ocasio2018 The bottom line of that cost reported to be between 50-200 million dollars. Big gap not sure of actual cost. Excessive expenditure for a job our troops did that didnt employ skills needed to defend us. Based on your logic they should be building roads now. We are paying them.
@quilts4veterans @SenBlumenthal @PPFA No never as birth control.
@serdanovic Wow insulting me is a waste of time. I'm too stupid to care. Have a very wonderful evening
@serdanovic @SenBlumenthal @PPFA Was that said? Where?
@quilts4veterans @SenBlumenthal @PPFA Never
@AfrikaDreamin @SenBlumenthal @PPFA Yet. Time will tell. SC just decided not to hear this case. No opinion or vote that confirms that thought.
@esquires1215 @jonathanweisman Exactly. Sort of like comparing armed robbery of a bank to stealing a dollar candy bar. Just not working for me.
@CoyoteTwelve @vazirabadi @annszipszky @Ocasio2018 Really were did you get these #s. Need to source them.
@TomECaster @vazirabadi @annszipszky @Ocasio2018 Does that include funds for sending 5000 troops to the border to help put out some barb wire? I am sure Trump could have negotiated contractors to be cheaper. He says he does that. Don't forget those $1400 coffee cups.
@CNN Just the folks Jared has been in bed with, US's new besties. Going to bleach my skin, I feel dirty.
@Ike_Kiefer @_coolpup_ @wng0701 @nprpolitics @Ocasio2018 Glad you can twist intent. Read the  thread. When you start at the end or assume, anything you might add brings nothing but laughter.  Nice night. Enjoy the stars
@MikeforTrump20 @Ocasio2018 Yes we are blessed to have her. Something we can agree on. Have a fine evening.
@Amy_Siskind When every decision ultimately comes down to the BEST being gauged in dollars our air, water, &amp; land  are sold to the polluters.  Without any protections or thought of long term effects, people suffer, but they are poor people, not Trump's people. You know those very fine people.
@Rons_Fire @Amy_Siskind Even his slogan MAGA is looking backwards, he longs for the days he had real hair.
@Ocasio2018 They feel threatened by your popularity. Ignore. Do not engage the nay sayers. Just stay true to the people you represent. The rest of us are fully supportive.
@MileyCyrus @davidgaliel Statement on clothing I can support.
@wng0701 @Ike_Kiefer @_coolpup_ @nprpolitics @Ocasio2018 Agreed about being paid. Hopefully the internships that mutually benefit both employer &amp; intern will continue. Thx for the thoughtful conversation.
@trailertrashmop @KamalaHarris Thank you for your enlightening reply. Have a day.
@IamPaulRevere @KamalaHarris Thank you for your brilliant comment. Have a day.
@trailertrashmop @KamalaHarris Taking care of our environment does help our citizens. Droughts, Hurricanes, Flooding hurt our people, cities, and infastructure. Those costs are high. Incidents have been intensifying. https://t.co/6X9g5AC2vB. NASA also has great info
@manlr61 @keithboykin @aalanasir Ok I'll have to agree silly. But that somebody drunk or sober would be able to rant such crap, esp in a higher Ed setting ticked me off. One wonders about the campus culture
@peterdaou A Monty Python skit ?
@BrendanNyhan Maybe it was one of the small white lies she told on Trumps behalf...nothing to see here.
@KevinMKruse I understand "smocking" guns are NOT NRA endorsed. So a no guilt sewing device.
@Reuters Sending best wishes their way. Hoping all are safe during this time.
@DafnaLinzer @senatemajldr @SpeakerRyan @Comey well @senatemajldr and @SpeakerRyan have a lot of everlasting shame attached to them. Just heap it onto the pile for those 2 that do not serve the good of the country.
@fred_guttenberg NRA has become just a hate group, America could only benefit from its demise.
@_SJPeace_ adorable.
@_SJPeace_ That is love.  That little boy looks like the sweetest little thing....mesmerized by his  dad.
@ToniM519 @KamalaHarris ? ?
@LynzyLab @ArianaGrande Sounding good.
@SMatthewsTFI @nytimes I will agree that when asked to leave for a valid reason you should go but we have not be given that information as of yet. Still I wish our officers had more training in talking folks into submission instead of physically making them submit.
@SMatthewsTFI @nytimes Lame excuse. You can stand like sardines but you can't sit? Really. If they were above capacity they should have locked their doors. No. They were just being mean, feeling powerful and behaved inappropriately.
@aschwartz112 @nytimes NYPD should train their officers to do a better job of communicating so that situations as simple as this do not escalate into a physical confrontations.  And couldn't the folks in that office find a couple of extra chairs somewhere. Where has common courtesy gone.
@SBMPediatrics Great to see school libraries are stepping up to the Fake news challenge. Recognizing reputable sources is so necessary. Best part is that it isn't limited to the internet. Ask an expert! Got to love that.
So funny. Love this. https://t.co/uKsFPBc2Ij
@jboydstunjr @KamalaHarris You tell me. Should we stop because we did so in the past and it so last year? There is no one day solution, it is a continued commitment.
@60Minutes @KFILE Seems Trump's tweets have made many companies stocks volatile? Why no concerns on Trump? We expect that behavior from him?
@hilaryluros ✋
@vickiebabbitt @KamalaHarris Yeah...this definitely isn't on topic.  Good night.
@vickiebabbitt @KamalaHarris We need alternative fuels, mass transit &amp; better efficiencies rather than less drivers for reducing emissions. Human decency will lift us up.
@trailertrashmop @KamalaHarris Numbers. From where &amp; when? Did you fact check? 1st one fact check https://t.co/O0Hsm9MgDO		What does this have to do with clean air, water and land ?Or climate change carbon emissions?
@jboydstunjr @KamalaHarris US has shown a decline. Due to lag time these are actually Obama's #s. Still a decline 1st yr Trump. But reduced %. 2018 &amp; 2019 projected increase. #s are funny Not Static. USA should lead. Toxic waste sites still haven't been cleaned up. Realist here.
@catcatgram @KamalaHarris By my saying something about what I saw does not make your point. Please we were talking about the environment. I am sure you care about clean air water and a reduction in carbon emissions so we can have a better quality of life. Let's agree on that. That is positive.
@vickiebabbitt @KamalaHarris I don't think the wall will have any impact on pollution or carbon emissions. Funny how some people think a wall can fix any problem ?? Don't see it.
@RBReich The thing about the Trump Presidency is we will survive, we will remember, &amp; we will not forgive. Holding  GOP responsible. Never again GOP broken trust.
@nytimes Mueller Mueller Does whatever  attorney can	Spins a web any size, catches thieves just like flies	Look out, here comes the Special Counselman
@nytimes Condolences to the family. Sending  love their way.
@michaelsgordon @KamalaHarris Stewardship of our land, water &amp; air is part of why we have government.
@realPersonNE1 @KamalaHarris ?
@Nj4Trump2020 @KamalaHarris protoctist
@stevebartin @KamalaHarris protoctist
@NLeedel @KamalaHarris not.
@KamalaHarris or being paid by Polluters and Corporations that are benefitting monetarily to ruining our environment. Bad environment - poor quality of health. Things like Flint Michigan's water supply should never happen. We need strong legislation &amp; enforcement.
@KamalaHarris It is apparent that the Right is a little intimidated by you, all the negative anti tweets i find here. Please our environment is very important. Clean air, Clean water, smaller Carbon footprint will increase our quality of life. Anybody that doesn't want that must be a robot.
@TIME Wait a position that Ivanka Trump has not been suggested would be wonderful at?
@AKx1K @RightWingWatch @FBI She is scaring the crap out of me. I wouldn't let her anywhere near a child.
@MalcolmNance Is this for real?
@politico Good Luck with Scott Walker - I am sure you will be ignored.
@Ocasio2018 If you clowns would stop your ridiculous charade of caring, problem is she responds unlike the GOP who are so removed from the people of this country that they believe we should all be ignored. GOP good governance for people is really all about governance for themselves &amp; pockets
@DickDurbin They won't act because they don't believe in it. They don't believe in alternative energy sources, in feeding healthy food to children, women, billionaires paying taxes, a nonpartisan judiciary &amp; President Obama is an American citizen. No surprises
@PateVege @senatemajldr @SenBobCorker @BobCorker I am an American and I approve this message.
@ChristianRep @senatemajldr @mercedesschlapp We have been praying but the President is still in office?
@lovealaska1105 @realDonaldTrump Well - hope she never has to report a sexual assault with that picture in the cosmos.. no matter how real the assault the jury won't find her attacker guilty.
@MajikaZulJin @dyllyp @keithboykin @shaunking @aalanasir @Columbia hysterical.
@rickmylectum @keithboykin @aalanasir one can hope
@keithboykin @aalanasir WOW.  Columbia University must not have any standards for admission. Hope everyone is making note not to go there for an education.
@ndr69424529 @TomSteyer Glad to know you are onboard with a cleaner environment. The biggest Govt mistake would be NOT to set an expectation for a cleaner environment. Businesses have in the past knowingly polluted because regulation or enforcement is missing. The same with government polluters .
@RBReich I told my granddaughter not everybody likes President Trump. She asked Why? I responded he isn't always nice. He calls people names &amp; stupid. She was. oh he doesn't sound like a good person. Kids get it. Why can't Trump's followers? Decorum in the Whitehouse Again. Vote GOP out.
@GothGuru @RBReich The very best people.
@ndr69424529 @TomSteyer Government should follow the laws too. Absolutely. Many sites are on govt properties and some still hidden. Legislation needs to be tough because selling our air, water &amp; carbon footprint would be detrimental &amp; costly. Glad we agree cleaner is better
@ndr69424529 @fredslickrock @TomSteyer Just like a 140 character tweet, the reason for riots in France being solely due to .37 cent gas tax hike is simplistic. Just like here there is a lot going on in their world.
@ndr69424529 @TomSteyer Agree Exxon Mobile makes big profits. 2017 Exxon pays a fine of $2.5 million &amp; spends $300 million on air pollution controls to resolve allegations that it violated the Clean Air Act. Without enforced good legislation comes problems, Business is about $$ not Earth's or my health.
@CAoutcast @TomSteyer In 2014,  1322 US Superfund sites. Superfund sites only small portion of contaminated sites. US carbon dioxide to grow in 2018 by 2.5%. Flint MI? We can do better! US Long list of problems. Hidden Agenda? Better Quality of life. Yup that is me.
@ndr69424529 @TomSteyer No expert in France's finances or any finances. If I look up Exxon Mobile profits for 2017, a company that produces only 3% oil in world their profits are up 32% in 2017.  Business is good for them.
@Jollybucnroger @Kboyk @Amy_Siskind Ok. Compromise can be good. Once you remove these regulations we slide backwards instead of forwards in helping kids be healthier.
@Jollybucnroger @Kboyk @Amy_Siskind I just don't agree healthy food is or has to be tasteless. Guess that is a main difference in opinion. Removing heathly food from these lunches is like giving up before you start in improving their food intake.
@b724a0e6c1764fa @zhaomemo @ABC7Chicago @MalcolmNance Agree.
@ndr69424529 @TomSteyer Don't think I said anything about US gas prices. Recently  in Canada noticed their prices were higher than US, but I understand Iran's are a quarter of US prices. I still want legislation for clean air, water,  &amp; lower carbon footprint. Environment matters.
@vv197071 Thanks for your delightful and illuminating response.
@zhaomemo @b724a0e6c1764fa @ABC7Chicago @MalcolmNance Happy Birthday ! Looking good at 100. Enjoy your day.
@Jollybucnroger @Kboyk @Amy_Siskind Your assumption that all kids go home to a refrigerator full of food is wrong. For some kids the food they receive in school is the best food or only food they get. If you were to feed a child only one meal a day do you think it should be crap or healthy?  I vote healthy.
@washingtonpost I eat therefore I am.
@hpmyers It happened so often. Thank you for speaking up now. Our silence did us no good, so hopefully now others will see that speaking up is a step towards the end of this abuse.
@CAoutcast @TomSteyer Your anger is misplaced at me. Why is wanting a cleaner environment a bad thing? France said Taxes, hurting their working people. I didn't. I believe we can have a cleaner environment &amp; a good economy.  Cleaner environment = better quality of life.
@jack Strange bedfellows Twitter dude/Meditation Guy.  I guess I could try Meditating before answering any of the anger provoking people I meet on Twitter. At least the breathing. Giving the finger to the screen, deep state then I am not offending anybody but myself. Insight on calming
@realDonaldTrump This makes it sound like you served in Vietnam? We know that is not true, so the "He Never Saw" is for you?Didn't you have college deferements and then some foot issue? Vietnam was a very sad time for our Country, I think we need to remember that. Decorum President.
@ChrisCoons Senator Coons you are way too nice. I appreciate that in you. Best of luck working with Heather Nauert - but I don't think she is Qualified and that is concerning.
@SenWhitehouse Sweet.....
@kootybear @GreggJarrett Congratulations. That is great.
@GSauceistheboss @Ike_Kiefer @_coolpup_ @wng0701 @nprpolitics @Ocasio2018 Interesting. I have learned/gained skills from my "paid" jobs. Some have even invested time and  money in my training. Yet never did they indicate that my time would be unpaid because I was benefitting from certificates, skills or experience. Opinion Students still should be paid
@MichaelDWolfe1 @sinkspur @GreggJarrett You get no points in life for being contrary in nature over the simplest of things. But it is your right if you so choose that direction. Obviously that was not said. Thx enjoy your evening.
@nytimes Vacation homes for the pigeons. Nice
@lexicorona2 @Leeser58 @GreggJarrett Been blocked by Trumpgirl @Leeser58 so I won't be engaging ... Just listening in to 1/2 a conversation.thx
@TomSteyer Yes. We can benefit economically as well as environmentally. The Oil Industry and the Polluters have just been telling us lies for so long, time to stop listening to that crap.
@DavidRa98724030 @davidhogg111 Are you suggesting Dementia?
@Bearded_Cynic @DesidResists @DickDurbin Honest. I don't think we need to forego economic growth for a sound environmental plan. Not mutually exclusive. Economic growth may be an added benefit of our reduction in our carbon footprint. Can't wait, hopefully we can slow it down to make it more than a trivial impact.peace
@Bearded_Cynic @DesidResists @DickDurbin Gas is cleaner and obviously cheaper &amp; more accessible, monetary reason for switch. Trump promised Coal comeback &amp; also wants to ease Greenhouse Gas emission standards. Science says humans are involved. There are things we can do, it's not politics, its negligence if we don't
@sinkspur @MichaelDWolfe1 @GreggJarrett I didn't call anybody smarter, that was a question I couldn't answer. The successful part I don't mind saying I believe Bill Gates is more so. Point - young people are not inherently NOT smart, there are many very amazing smart young people &amp; people that were smart while young.
@BLight1911 @NPR Your use of curse words when totally unnecessary diminishes anything you have to say to me. Have a perfect Saturday.
@CREWcrew @GdnsGraciousMe "Jenkins' office said in a statement she consulted with the House Ethics Committee before forming the business. " from US News - haha laughing until crying.   	The law is not the law which makes perfect sense when Rudy Giuliani says 'truth isn't truth'
@jmclaughlinSAIS Those words will fall on deaf ears, just like ours have for the past 2 years.
@BLight1911 @NPR Right so where are the children in this picture? Damn those French hide them well in photo ops.
@GreggJarrett Smart is smart. Tons of folks did amazing things at young ages and far exceeded your level of "success". Bill Gates wrote his first software program at the age of 13. Gates smarter than you at 13? And the beat (list) goes on...
@Ron_Annette @ellievan65 Go back read the story. I dont know one child that is physically attached to either parent after birth and until the reach 21.
@msq4000 @ellievan65 Maybe that person should not be working for the State Dept then? Maybe that person's supervisor or manager should have intervened and signed the okey dokey.  More importantly why was the father denied this?
@PennyPhilosophy @SenFeinstein @SenWhitehouse Choices are important. Govt needs to fine, ban and eliminate choices of cheap environment destroying products(in production &amp; use). Hardworking people make bad choices based on immediate needs. I get that. Fix the Choices. Stop Industry from selling us destruction in a bag.
@PennyPhilosophy Choices are important. Govt needs to fine, ban and eliminate choices of cheap environment destroying products(in production &amp; use). Hardworking people make bad choices based on immediate needs. I get that. Fix the Choices. Stop Industry from selling us destruction in a bag.
@PennyPhilosophy @SenFeinstein @SenWhitehouse Vote for folks that will make public substantive solutions. Best thing that the public can do. Support Environment Pro Candidates. Get Corporate Money out of our politics and Elections. Fight to rid us of Citizens United. Individuals together voting is the real deal for change.
@MikeAmerica7 @realEricBTucker @SenFeinstein @SenWhitehouse Right. Because nothing we do could possibly affect the air, water, or climate. We are just living in this vacuum where nothing escapes and has no consequence on earth or our surroundings. Man has not marred the earth in any way whatsoever. &amp; Cigarettes don't cause cancer.
@Ocasio2018 Total  - Not in my Backyard Syndrome!! It is ALL Our Backyards. I don't call this radical - this is just good stewardship of our land, air and communities.
@Ike_Kiefer @_coolpup_ @wng0701 @nprpolitics @Ocasio2018 I went to college to learn. Same as grade school. I don't think any of my college professors (or 1st grade teachers)made me work to benefit themselves in any monetary or academic way. Interns perform job duties/function that if they were not there a paid person would do.
@LewisSunflower @nytimes True. But Not pursuing the law for one in power sets a precedent that America has to avoid. Other businesses have been targeted in the past for these situations. Immigration reform/fixes need to be made. The solutions need to reach more than a handful at Trumps properties.
@cathypotter57 @kimguilfoyle @DonaldJTrumpJr Night night.
@cindilou20 @kimguilfoyle @DonaldJTrumpJr I believe you are misinformed. And Hurricane damage has increased not decreased. But have a nice night. Bye bye.
@cathypotter57 @kimguilfoyle @DonaldJTrumpJr So a threat only matters if it is carried thru? If that is the case this whole conversation regarding Don Jr. is pointless.
@cindilou20 @kimguilfoyle @DonaldJTrumpJr After hurricanes have decimated homes over and over again. Still allowed to build on areas known to be a problem and then purchase federally funded flood insurance.
@LewisSunflower @nytimes okay - I agree.  All I am saying is that these developments indicate an investigation is needed at this location and maybe his other locations as well.
@cathypotter57 @kimguilfoyle @DonaldJTrumpJr Donald Trump did threaten California with withholding funding. Odd that a young woman first time Congressperson is being jumped on by somebody that doesn't like her. Don Jr is not just a citizen, he uses his family as position-there was no threat that's a lonnnng stretch to make
@Dal_Schnur @SteveTroy_USMC @nytimes What is your point? So  are you saying when presented with a case that a business clearly is in violation we do nothing? Or is it when the President's business is clearly in violation we do nothing?
@cindilou20 @kimguilfoyle @DonaldJTrumpJr Threatening to withhold funds had nothing to do with the "caravan" and the federal government should never use their help in a disaster as a leverage, punishment or reward.
@DebbieEmbleton1 @nytimes @realDonaldTrump Cursing certainly was not necessary, and because it wasn't even used with any valid reason, I think I will say good night and block you.
@Dal_Schnur @SteveTroy_USMC @nytimes It may not be mandated but can still be used by business locations in NJ.  Due diligence when hiring for these types of positions.  It also would be a best practice to do so, especially when it is common practice at your other locations. And when you wish to be a politician.
@Dal_Schnur @SteveTroy_USMC @nytimes I did. That location had a problem with many undocumented employees hired. Verification of SSN not done because the one she used later turned up phony. She had direct contact with Mr. Trump. This being a big issue for Trump &amp; he never questioned the hiring of non english speakers
@TrinityResists @brycetache Unqualified idiot going to the UN to represent the US. America the country that  elected an Unqualified person as President. Makes sense. Please stop the world now - I would very much like to step off.
@tomwatson comfortable.
@dreamersoften @NPR hahaha
@DebbieEmbleton1 @nytimes @realDonaldTrump Like the world cares what you believe. This is a case where the US Citizens need a full investigation to determine the extent of abuses at this location and other Trump properties. All Businesses must follow the same LAWS in this country.
@LewisSunflower @nytimes hahaha. That he wasn't aware is lame. I have not heard of one Republican accepting that excuse when the object of concern is a Democrat. Justice is supposed not to be partisan. This is a LAW BREAKING CASE that need our JUSTICE SYSTEM to investigate and prosecute.
@jeanlevelo55 @nytimes She worked in his home too. President Trump had direct contact. Investigate all his properties. I think more instances will be found.
@Dal_Schnur @SteveTroy_USMC @nytimes Supervisor knew... How were these applications verified? Lots of Questions. There needs to be an investigation of all his properties.
@DebbieEmbleton1 @nytimes @realDonaldTrump The first woman that came forward indicated she had direct contact with Mr. Trump. Cleaned his home. Received bonus cash from him(did he report this and pay taxes on these cash bonuses) Indicated her supervisor knew her status. Not a far leap to imagine Mr. Trump did too.
@Jwest155 @nytimes The only one that said "advocate of illegal immigration" was you. Are you?
@nytimes No Surprise. Bet there are some at his other properties too. Hypocrisy that only his cult followers could ignore. Investigate. Prosecute. How many undocumented employees it makes a difference. Shut Trump down. Depending on findings - Jail time? License Loss? Fines?
@inkiepink @CNNTonight @donlemon @ChrisCuomo Civility needs to be returned but not to President Trump. The Obama's and the Clintons owe him no civility at all.
@CNNTonight @donlemon @ChrisCuomo haha - I had been debating that in my head. Decided that it was their decision and yes or no...it's okay because they do everything with class.  I am not so sure I would have been so cordial.
@kimguilfoyle @DonaldJTrumpJr It's more disturbing when the Commander in Chief,  President of the United States threatens to pull funding to California for wildfires while they are fighting devastating fires. People losing lives &amp; homes. A standing President threatens his US citizens instead of offering help.
@alphaMOMster @DDee881625 @realDonaldTrump whaat?????????
@DepoyNeil @SenWhitehouse Americans were Stoopid and did nothing after the Oil Crisis of the 70's. We can do better than putting money in the Saudi's pocket, oil industry pocket, polluting our air and water, and saying stuff like "keeps our homes warm &amp; gets us back &amp; forth to work". Improved Technology?
RT @OregonJOBS2: Trump Jr's feed is pretty much memes you saw on your racist uncle's Facebook account from 2 weeks ago.
@DickDurbin People in many countries &amp; some parts of our own have listen for the air quality index. Radio stations giving warning for the elderly &amp; children's exposure. This was not happening 50 years ago. It only is going to get worse. Time we stop this assault on our well being
@David34271557 @mwhatsnext @nprpolitics @Ocasio2018 @SenMajLdr @LindseyGrahamSC @ChuckGrassley @SenJohnKennedy @SenatorCollins So she should find a way to use those funds for herself like so many in the swamp. Why arent others compensating those working for them is a better question!
@tonyschwartz My hope too
