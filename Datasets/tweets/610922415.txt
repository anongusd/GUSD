OTD Jackie Robinson would have been 100. Early on I saw him simply as my favorite player. It was later that I realized the impact he had on the world as a civil rights hero as well as a baseball player &amp; when I was 12 he signed my autograph book-Keep your smile a long, long while
Shortly before his death OTD in 1973 LBJ cautioned "we haven't done nearly enough" to attain the ever-elusive but essential goal—"to assure that all Americans play by the same rules and all Americans play against the same odds." Remembering him today. https://t.co/oAHMMPiGlD
Remembering Theodore Roosevelt OTD 100 years ago: "Death had to take him sleeping, for if Roosevelt had been awake there would have been a fight," said a politician then. Now it is up to us to fight for his conservation legacy &amp; our beloved national parks. https://t.co/35AMEW8L2k
So honored that "Leadership In Turbulent Times" is named one of @BNBuzz’s 15 Best Books of 2018 as well as in the Best History &amp; Current Affairs category, alongside other books I've thoroughly enjoyed and authors whom I respect so much! https://t.co/G1gIHdhVt6 #BNBestBooksOf2018 https://t.co/VLNDqRAw8R
How lucky I was to be able to talk about my new #leadership book and to share laughs with my friend @StephenAtHome #LSSC. For Abraham Lincoln, humor was life affirming. In fact, friends of Lincoln said it was "necessary to his very existence"; intended "to whistle off sadness." https://t.co/7iEfJZf5NL
50+ years later, on the anniversary of #JFK’s assassination, I am still inspired by his sentiment that public service is an honorable profession. Heartened by the record numbers who ran for the first time in #Midterms2018, let's work to restore dignity &amp; value to public service!
What a joy to sign books for @BNBuzz's #BlackFriday #BNSignedEditions event across the country, allowing me to imagine a direct connection to the reader. It has meant the world to me to actually meet so many of you on the book tour. Thank you for your support &amp; happy Thanksgiving https://t.co/NAYdNp174E
OTD 1863 Lincoln in his Gettysburg Address resolved "That these dead shall not have died in vain, that this nation under God shall have a new birth of freedom, and that government of the people, by the people, for the people shall not perish from the earth.” Words &amp; action matter
On this #VeteransDay &amp; the centennial of World War I's ending, let us remember, honor and commit to take much better care of our #Veterans. As JFK said: "As we express our gratitude, we must never forget that the highest appreciation is not to utter words, but to live by them.”
What today brings is an awakening of citizenship engagement essential to strengthening our democracy. As FDR trusted: "Nobody will ever deprive the American people of the right to vote except the American people themselves and the only way they could do this is by not voting." https://t.co/8xop5frQRG
As poet Robert Frost wrote: “My goal in life is to unite my avocation with my vocation, as my two eyes make one in sight.” Loving both sports &amp; history as I have my whole life, how awesome to see @NBA great @laker @KingJames carrying my new book "Leadership In Turbulent Times." https://t.co/h6yRiYbhZG

What Teddy Roosevelt said in 1898! applies to @SenJohnMcCain's legacy: “A soft, easy life is not worth living, if it impairs the fibre of brain and heart and muscle. We must dare to be great; and we must realize that greatness is the fruit of toil and sacrifice and high courage.”
“For us is the life of action, of strenuous performance of duty; let us live in the harness, striving mightily; let us rather run the risk of wearing out than rusting out," TR also said. @SenJohnMcCain—leader, patriot, warrior. He will be sorely missed.
For me, Lincoln’s legacy burns the brightest. Proud &amp; excited to have the first excerpt from my new book "Leadership In Turbulent Times" in @HarvardBiz for your weekend read! Thank you https://t.co/0eoV0xshlu led by @adiman @asbernstein2185 https://t.co/rY6P3waeiV @SimonBooks

Experience matters, but even more so, we should be looking at our candidates' character, temperament, vision, judgment &amp; teamwork.
Buchanan had vast experience but is ranked one of the worst presidents. Lincoln had almost no administrative experience &amp; is one of the best
Looking ahead... Experience does matter. Not the number of posts a candidate has held, but how they performed &amp; what they learned &amp; absorbed
For 40 years, I have been privileged to study the great U.S. presidents. It's been inspiring to now think about their leadership in new ways
I am examining how they first identified themselves as leaders, how they grew as leaders &amp; how they led. Finding fresh stories, revelations!
Hi @robRVA! Yes, I am hard at work on my new book on leadership. I’m excited to bring my four “guys” into the same room -- AL, TR, FDR &amp; LBJ
LBJ's Great Society agenda created programs 4 elementary &amp; secondary education, voting rights, housing, immigration &amp; more. Still work to do
LBJ said of Great Society plan, “Until we banish ignorance, until we win the war on poverty” our country will not continue to lead the world
Part of LBJ's Great Society agenda, the bill gave scholarships, loans &amp; work opps to 1 million of 1.3 million that didn't go on to college….
#OTD 50 yrs ago #LBJ, at his alma mater Southwest Texas State Teachers College, now Texas State U, signed into law the Higher Education Act.

@portdauphin @chucktodd Good point. Needed in Senate is better balance between working together in DC &amp; staying in touch w/sentiment at home
.@chucktodd Wish I could name a specific person, but tribal atmosphere of Senate today makes emergence of "lion" less likely #tweetthepress
.@chucktodd Whether deserved or not, members of family dynasties have celebrity, name recognition, access to money &amp; campaign workers.
.@chucktodd In old days, Senators stayed in DC on weekends, played poker, drank together. Did not rush home to raise money. Had camaraderie!
.@chucktodd Had Ted K. been able to continue the fight for health care, it is possible the bill would have had more bipartisan support.
.@chucktodd Institute's use of past examples of Senate compromise &amp; camaraderie so missing today, will hopefully inspire generation to come!
@chucktodd After Ted K's presidential run failed, he was welcomed back home! From that moment on, his full dedication was to the Senate.
@chucktodd Great focus! The Senate was Ted K.'s home &amp; life so to memorialize the Senate not just the man seems quite fitting #tweetthepress
@chucktodd What fun for a historian used to long handwritten letters &amp; diaries to be answering in real time &amp; 140 characters! #TweetThePress
This was #Lincoln's dream from the time he was young, to be worthy of being remembered by historians after he died, nearly 150 years ago!

Construction worker: To hear #FDR's fireside chat! "I figure if he’s willing to take the time to talk to me, the least I can do is be there”
#FDR said the speeches would lose their effectiveness if there were too many. Case in point: A construction worker rushing to get home. Why?
#OTD 1933 #FDR gave 1st of 30 some radio fireside chats @WhiteHouse. He knew what modern presidents don't: If his speeches became routine...
After #FDR's inaugural address, tens of thousands of letters poured into the @WhiteHouse. The American people had found their leader!
Also #OTD 1933 #FDR inaugurated 32nd president. His speech showed a serene confidence in his countrymen and offered renewed hope to millions
After the address, #Lincoln told Frederick Douglass there was no one whose opinion he valued more. “It was a sacred effort,” Douglass said.

But they were stunned by his response! Allen said, there is nothing to make an Englishman s**t faster than the sight of Gen. Washington!
The British were hoping Allen would be upset by the indignity of seeing the sight of Gen. George Washington, America’s hero, in an outhouse!
After the Revolution, #Lincoln said, Allen visited Britain. Upset by their loss, his hosts put a picture of Gen. Washington in the outhouse!
#OTD 1789 Revolutionary hero #EthanAllen died. #OTD 1809, #AbrahamLincoln was born. Mr. Allen is the subject of Lincoln’s favorite story!

Thanks @Westport_HH @wbnamerica #WorldBookNight committee for selecting #WaitTillNextYear! We must tell &amp; retell the stories of our lives!
That unwavering ambition to do something to merit being remembered became his lodestar as he saved the Union, won the War, and ended slavery
However, years earlier, he suffered a suicidal depression.But said he'd done nothing worthy enough to make anyone remember that he had lived
As we mark #Lincoln's death on this day in 1865, we remember the man who, against all odds, became our greatest president.

Thanks @Giambusso. TR would have been dee-lighted by all the attention! http://t.co/ivssYVue0v
Yes! So enjoyed being w/wonderful @mayortommenino @whitehouse to celebrate pride in #Boston and our beloved @RedSox! http://t.co/Md5a3eLDiy
@WhiteHouse honoring @RedSox w/@ThomasCWerner @XanderBogaerts!	@BarackObama said: "I’m grateful for their character." http://t.co/50M55BoMW2
On this day in 1912, First Lady Nellie Taft planted the first Cherry Tree given to the US by Japan as a symbol of international friendship.
Yes, @_taylor_ @SwiftlyTom Lincoln &amp; TR would both have relished the chance to use humor to reach new audiences! #BetweenTwoFerns
#BetweenTwoFerns may not be FDR’s Fireside Chats, but @BarackObama has found a modern day #BullyPulpit to talk #healthcare w/@galifianakisz
We remember FDR's words that day: "The only thing we have to fear is fear itself,” but we should also remember the emotions of that grim day
81 years ago today, at the height of the Great Depression, FDR’s first inaugural gave hope and direction to a badly frightened nation.
Born on this day in 1809, #Lincoln 's ability to withstand adversity and come through trials of fire proved an essential leadership trait.
Born 205 years ago this day, Abraham Lincoln endured poverty, family deaths &amp; personal failure before becoming  our most honored president.
Thank you @BBCNewsnight @iankatz1000. "If you have to start all over again, then you’re not learning from the past." http://t.co/kSGkcCwBHe
Congratulations, my friend, Steven Spielberg on the well-deserved honor of the 2014 Lincoln Leadership Prize! @ALPLM http://t.co/gBVSLBwVR1
Thanks Marc @JazzWax for @WSJ  It was a pleasure to talk with you and share the history of our home &amp; town. I especially love your headline!
Today in 1919, TR died in his sleep @ 60. Death had to take him sleeping. For if (he) had been awake, there would have been a fight, said VP

I have loved baseball since my father taught me to keep score when I was 6. Watching the #RedSox win is the happiest day of my baseball life
Heading to Fenway with hopes that this magical team which has carried us further than we could have imagined can carry us all the way home!

The dream to be remembered that had powered Lincoln all his life had been realized. His story would be told for generations.
At 7:22 this day in 1865, Abraham Lincoln was pronounced dead. "Now," Stanton correctly predicted, "he belongs to the ages."
When I was young, Jackie Robinson was my favorite player. He was a civil rights hero and a baseball legend. Can't wait to see the new movie!
@Marzullo9 After spending ten years writing Lincoln this is simply great to hear from you!
Looking forward to interviewing Rebecca Miller about her new book Jacob's Folly Wed 3/20, 6pm in Boston #bpl Join us! http://t.co/yaUSerJTgL
Now Daniel, like #Lincoln, belongs to the ages. Congrats to my friend on his historic third Oscar win! #Oscars2013 http://t.co/pZdb4542aN

On this Presidents Day, let us remember LBJ's words: There are no problems we cannot solve together, and very few that we can solve alone.
What is so special about the SOTU address is the spectacle of our whole government gathered in one room at one time. http://t.co/yvUWYbJV
Food for thought from Lincoln on this 204th anniversary of his birth: "People are just about as happy as they make up their minds to be."
Yes! Lincoln’s beauty of language is what everyone reaches for, but most importantly for an Inaugural speech is that the words create action
Civil, Gay &amp; Women’s rights movements are critical in transforming our attitudes about ourselves and each other. That’s when change happens.
It was also a more forceful, eloquent and fighting speech. Fighting in a good sense, in a "We the people" fighting together way. @nbcnews
JFK had that sense of humility about how his own Inaugural address would rank with one of the greats of all time. More: http://t.co/qZTRl5Cg
On this Inauguration eve in 1961, JFK re-read Jefferson's Inaugural address. And said to Jackie: “Better than mine, better than mine.”  #CNN
I need to brush up on my Yiddish! @meetthepress	 http://t.co/qhczXe1u
Here at the Globes for Lincoln! http://t.co/xUCY9fWS
On this day in 1865, the 13th Amendment abolishing slavery was declared in effect! Same day as Steven Spielberg's B-Day. Coincidence? Fate?
Lincoln said a president "had as good a right to thank God as a Governor" and made last Thurs. of Nov. a day of #Thanksgiving.
Until the Civil War, Thanksgiving was celebrated on different days at the discretion of governors. In 1863, Lincoln made it a nat'l holiday
For a historian used to living with dead Presidents, what a thrill to be in the audience as #Lincoln came to life! http://t.co/oxAcnL71
It's difficult to imagine any candidate doing that today!
Lincoln didn't believe a candidate should vote for himself, so he cut off the top of the ticket and voted only for state and local offices.
@BarackObama righted his Ship of State. The passenger of the 1st debate became the captain of the 2nd, promising a smoother sail to Nov.
Given baseball superstitious nature, let's wait until next year to change Teddy's luck. Also see @washingtonpost http://t.co/GCzqHOTC
Rough ride for Teddy Roosevelt Mascot? @WSJ http://t.co/ckvGbBPd Yes, #TRMascot is on a terrible losing streak but #Nats are winning big.
When victory came at Antietam, the time was right!
Lincoln thought to issue the EP earlier but Seward advised wait 'til "the eagle of victory takes his flight," so not to seem a desperate act
150 yrs ago today, Pres. Abraham Lincoln issued the Emancipation Proclamation declaring freedom for slaves in the confederacy as of 1/1/1863
Fun Fact: Success of Teddy Bear honoring T Roosevelt led toymakers to market Billy Possum for Taft. Looked like rat, kids cried, didn't sell
@Portfromstorm While kids, parents + grandparents spent time together in WH, cannot think of another presidency when all 3 gens lived in WH
Dick and I just cast our first vote for our son @JoeKGoodwin! Vote for Joe in today's MA #3rdMid Primary! #mapoli http://t.co/BJlWzCVQ

Exciting news! #StevenSpielberg sets date to bring his Lincoln film to life on Nov. 9 in select cities; Nov. 16 nationwide. #TeamOfRivals
Teddy Roosevelt must have known: http://t.co/u5SVggSe! Drank 16 cups of coffee a day, gave Maxwell House slogan, "good to the last drop."

A century ago Republican Mark Hanna said “2 things are important in politics. 1st is money and I can’t remember the 2nd.” Sadly true today!
Looking forward to talking baseball on Sunday with @BobSchieffer on @Facethenation.
These late night @RedSox games on the West Coast are killing me. I'm no longer twenty years old! Yet can't sleep till it's over.
Thanks for the mention @jenamcgregor #SCOTUS http://t.co/DTNsFqeo
Cont..."Consequently, he who moulds public sentiment goes deeper than he who enacts statutes or pronounces decisions."
#SCOTUS rules. Recalls #Lincoln: "Public sentiment is everything. With public sentiment, nothing can fail; without it nothing can succeed."
Shared a fun panel yesterday in #Concord w/ @AnnieLeibovitz. Topic: Old houses tell stories. She thru  photos, me thru letters + words.
Youk says good bye to #Sox fans in dramatic style. Echoes of Ted Williams’ final at bat a half century ago!
@thewhistlinggrl Steffens, Ida Tarbell, Ray Baker + William Allen White are heroes! Together w/TR they create climate for progressive reform
My first #FF goes out to my son @JoeKGoodwin, a veteran of two wars, who is running for state Senator in MA http://t.co/noWgCO4F #MaPoli

@TroyBramston In 2013. Double bio of TR, Taft leading up to 1912 when they run against each other. Muckrakers play big role. Stay tuned!
It's a commentary on the sad state of our beloved @RedSox that I woke up happy this morning because they are finally back to .500!
@Markhalperin Thank you, my mentor, for bringing me into the modern age! The railsplitter would be proud - trains then, twitter now!
@dbernstein I'm new at this! I am following our next state senator @joekgoodwin now! #MaPoli
This is my first tweet ever. For an historian accustomed to enormously long books this will be a challenge to compress thoughts!
