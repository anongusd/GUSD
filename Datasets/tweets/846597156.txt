This is also figuring in the fact that Tyler Clippard and Josh Harrison (who would've cracked this lineup) both signed YESTERDAY.		It's a bit weak on SP, and I would probably swap out Span or Holliday for another reliever, but this is a ++ OF and a very solid bullpen.

The #Mets' acquisition of RP Edwin Diaz, the #Phillies' of RPs Juan Nicasio and James Pazos, and the #Nationals' signing of SP Patrick Corbin makes for a true "Arms Race" in the NL East.
@TheGoodPhight Huh. Didn't realize Nicasio was making so much. Still, would rather have it in movable pieces like a decent bullpen arm and good SS than below-average 1B. The numbers work out to be about the same (give or take), but Phils are getting much more value.

@alanapaints @JerryFalwellJr No, it's not. Please find an example of a Julio-Claudian emperor using Caesar as a title. (Hint: You can't)
@thesixthwoman @JerryFalwellJr The fact that this is a translation aside, this isn't any kind of proof that Jesus ever said anything to any Roman emperor. He lived 2500+ miles away and never left Judaea.
@Bord_n @thesixthwoman @JerryFalwellJr Gaius (known as Caligula, meaning "Little Boots") was emperor from 37-41 CE. The Roman emperor for the majority of Jesus' adult life was Tiberius, Augustus' stepson by his wife, Livia (r. 14-37 CE). Caesar was simply his name after adoption by Augustus in 4 CE, not a title.
@daylinleach Our disagreement is really about the role of government, not strictly taxes. Even the Founders were aware that innovation must be nurtured (the Copyright Office in I.8). We should be extremely wary of suggesting that increased net worth (not income) ought to be taxed higher.

@peaceviajustice @timschreiernyc @JerryFalwellJr That's not true. At the time, it was just Julius Caesar's cognomen (family name). The use of "Caesar" as a title actually post-dates the death of Jesus by a good 3 or 4 decades.

Seems like the refs in this game have radically different standards for what constitutes a foul on different ends of the court.
Providence's ball: Shot clock off, no timeouts, down by 1. This is the moment a team trains for all year. Dunn's gotta be the one to shoot.

The Eagles fooled me into thinking they were an actual NFL team for 12 minutes. But the Sixers moved up to 2-30 tonight, so there's that.
Barner's drop is emblematic of this game and this season. Too many costly mistakes and poor play calls with mediocre personnel.
