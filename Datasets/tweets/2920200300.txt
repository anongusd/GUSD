ps. Addendum,	I hope not that such disasters happen again, here on Twitter and elsewhere. And I hope that I shall look back on this day, knowing everyone affected has now found their footing, and knowing it never happened once again.
But hopefully, the rulers of fair lands similar to these, whether they‚Äôd be million dollar higherups or groups of likeminded individuals, will learn from such mistakes as these, and not repeat them once again, as Tumblr has now, and many a fallen had before.Fairwell. (3/3)#Tumblr
Midnight, 17th of Dec, It happened. This place of hope have been irradiated into a wasteland of despair. There‚Äôs no turning back. I‚Äôve always believed in the old quote of Never attributing something to malice which is adequately explained by stupidity. I know not whom it‚Äôs from.
(Originally posted on Tumblr)	Farewell (1/3)	Midnight, 16th of December,	In a matter of an hour, this platform will turn from a place of inclusivity and diversity for the oppressed and marginalised to a deserted wasteland of backwards and bigoted discrimination.	Farewell.	#Tumblr
