(5/5) Workers in the private carting industry need &amp; deserve representation that works for them, not the company‚Äôs ownership. This bill will ensure they have this right. I thank @NYCSpeakerCoJo for his support &amp; @kierafeldman &amp; @teamstersJC16 for bringing this issue to light.
(4/5) Today I will intro a bill to expand @NYCBIC‚Äôs authority to investigate union officers associated w/ the carting industry. This will enable us to root out sham unions &amp; ensure that workers can partake in legitimate unions with workers‚Äô rights and best interests in mind.
(3/5) .@NYCBIC is authorized to root out organized crime in the private carting industry, but labor orgs fall outside their purview. This leaves a blind spot in the agency‚Äôs ability to pursue organized crime in the industry.
(2/5) Without the ability to organize and advocate autonomously on behalf of their own interests, workers are subject to heinous &amp; at times life threatening working conditions and labor practices. https://t.co/60gkiZVQOY

@JoeBorelliNYC @BarackObama Would it matter if you had 2 officers or 50 if you lived in a community where crime didn't exist. Either number wouldn't effect change. So why not remove factors that contribute to perception of high crime. ie police officers.
@JoeBorelliNYC @BarackObama Still not teachers. Also Obama preferred many legislative alternatives that were unrealistic to pass through a Republican led House and Senate. I guess this was his "better than nothing" idea. Btw im only noting why there was no hysteria.
