@TheRealStacyD Make sense?
@TheRealStacyD So if Manchin were a no, it would have been 50-50 and Pence would have broken the tie.
@TheRealStacyD Not exactly. Murkowski voted present because a Republican yes vote (Sen. Daines) was at his daughter’s wedding. They would have held the vote ‘til he returned. So they would have canceled each other out. IE, with Daines it would have been 51-49.
The Senate has now confirmed Brett Kavanaugh as a Supreme Court Justice by a vote of 50-48.
When Joe Manchin votes “aye”, loud shouts of “SHAME SHAME SHAME” echo from the gallery. Manchin is the only Democrat to vote in favor of the Kavanaugh nomination.

@AveryWallace81 Not sure what you're referring to. Scalia was confirmed by a vote of 98-0 in 1986.
Somewhere in between:	Sotomayor: 68-31	Kagan: 63-37
Other narrow confirmations:	Thomas: 52-48	Alito: 58-42	Gorsuch 54-45
Ginsburg:  96-3	Souter:  90-9	Kennedy: 97-0	Scalia:  98-0	O'Connor: 99-0

@bellwak Correct. But he could use his potential no vote as leverage.

This was remarkable. @ChuckGrassley says "because of the two hour rule, we're adjourned." @SenFeinstein says, "What?!?" Grassley: "we have a gentlemen's and women's agreement."  Feinstein says she doesn't know what they've agreed to.
. @JeffFlake: "This country's being ripped apart here.... I do think we can have a short pause and make sure the FBI can investigate." Says he's willing to make that request to the White House.  #KavanaughHearings
. @JeffFlake says he's voted to move Kavanaugh's nomination out of committee, but indicates he'll only vote yes in a final floor vote if the FBI does an investigation.
. @LindseyGrahamSC says it doesn't matter what the committee does re investigation; it's up to McConnell and Schumer.
Democrats are still asking for additional investigation. @SenFeinstein says she thought what @JeffFlake was doing included that investigation.
. @ChuckGrassley has quickly gaveled the vote. Republicans have all voted yes. Democrats voting no.
This is quite confusing. And the Senators are confused among themselves about just what they're voting on now.
NOW: @JeffFlake "I think it would be proper to delay the floor vote for up to but not more than 1 week ... to allow the FBI to do an investigation limited in time and scope." Will vote to advance the floor vote with that understanding.
. @SenBooker: "The only person who has denied the [assault] has taken place, who says it did not happen, is Judge Kavanaugh."
. @SenBooker (D-NJ) - "Judge Kavanaugh has everything to lose if these allegations are investigated and proved true... His testimony regarding his drinking habits... have been contradicted by so many people. His statements have proven to be just not true."
@BoyceDan @KirkSiegler That’s just my resting reporter-fly-in face.

@slaub TelePrompTers
"You can be the generation that at a critical moment stood up and reminded us just how precious this experiment in democracy really is, just how powerful it can be when we fight for it.... I believe in you... And I will be right there with you every step of the way."  (end)
"When you vote, you've got the power to make sure white nationalists don't feel emboldened to march with their hoods off or their hoods on in Charlottesville in the middle of the day. Thirty minutes. Thirty minutes of your time. Is democracy worth that?"
"When you vote, you've got the power to make it easier to afford college, and harder to shoot up a school. When you vote, you've got the power to make sure a family keeps its health insurance; you could save somebody's life."
"In the end, the threat to our democracy doesn't just come from Donald Trump or the current batch of Republicans in Congress or the Koch Brothers and their lobbyists, or too much compromise from Democrats, or Russian hacking. The biggest threat to our democracy is indifference."
"The antidote to a government controlled by a powerful fear, a government that divides, is a government by the organized, energized, inclusive many. That's what this moment's about. That has to be the answer. You cannot sit back and wait for a saviour."
Obama on Republicans: "We'll click our tongues and issue vague statements of disappointment when the President does something outrageous, but we won't actually do anything about it. That's not civility. That's abdicating your responsibilities."
"We are Americans. We're supposed to stand up to bullies. Not follow them. We're supposed to stand up to discrimination. And we're sure as heck supposed to stand up, clearly and unequivocally, to Nazi sympathizers. How hard can that be?"
"Over the past few decades, the politics of division, of resentment and paranoia has unfortunately found a home in the Republican Party.... They're undermining our alliances, cozying up to Russia. What happened to the Republican Party? "
"They start undermining norms that ensure accountability, try to change the rules to entrench their power further. And they appeal to racial nationalism that's barely veiled, if veiled at all. Sound familiar?"
"Demagogues promise simple fixes to complex problems. They promise to fight for the little guy even as they cater to the wealthiest and the most powerful. They promise to clean up corruption and then plunder away."
More from @BarackObama : "When there's a vacuum in our democracy, when we don't vote, when we take our basic rights and freedoms for granted... then other voices fill the void. A politics of fear and resentment and retrenchment takes hold. "
From Obama's speech today: "Appealing to tribe, appealing to fear, pitting one group against another, telling people that order and security will be restored if it weren't for those who don't look like us or don't sound like us or don't pray like we do, that's an old playbook."

A clearly frustrated @ChuckGrassley "Can I ask my colleagues on the other side of the aisle how long you're going to go on with this?... I've been accused of having a mob rule session." Says he won't grant any of their motions.
. @JohnCornyn: "It's hard to take the [Democrats] seriously" in asking for more documents when all Dems on the committee have already stated their opposition to the nominee.
. @SenatorLeahy: "This is unprecedented... I'm just sorry to see the Senate Judiciary Committee descend this way." Says for Justice Elena Kagan's hearing, 99% of documents were made available to the committee 12 days before the hearing.  For Kavanaugh: 7%.
Female Senator is heard muttering, "This is outrageous."  (I'm not sure who.)
. @ChuckGrassley: "This is something I've never gone through before in 15 nominations... I was interrupted before I got to say the agenda for today." Calls for decorum.
. @SenBlumenthal puts forward motion to adjourn and go into executive session.  @ChuckGrassley denies him a vote, saying that's out of order. Blumenthal: "This process will be tainted and stained forever."
More @SenFeinstein: " give us the time to do our work."
Sen. Diane Feinstein: "This is my 9th hearing. These are very unique circumstances."  Vetting process "has cast aside tradition in favor of speed." Notes that Republican Senators didn't even meet with Obama nominee Merrick Garland.
. @CoryBooker: "To go into this hearing without those documents is an undermining of the constitutional role we have sworn to uphold."
. @ChuckGrassley's gavel is getting a solid workout, and the hearing has barely begun.
One issue is executive privilege: are extensive documents from Kavanaugh's time serving in the Bush White House protected by confidentiality?
Sen. Leahy: "What are we trying to hide? Why are we rushing?" #KavanaughConfirmation
Grassley responds to Booker: "You're taking advantage of my decency." Loud heckling heard in the hearing room.
Wow. Democrats at #Kavanaugh hearing are coming out swinging even before chairman Grassley speaks. Blumenthal calls hearing a charade and mockery; @CoryBooker calls it a "violation." They want a delay to review documents.

4/ As for the march? “This is fantastic,” Jay says. “I identify with these kids. I know what they’ve been through.”
3/ But Jay has recovered. His biggest disability now is with short-term memory (“How old am I? That’s a tough one. 34? 33?”), he has vision trouble, and his right hand remains limp, but he continues to progress in his healing.
2/ Joe chokes up as he remembers what the parents first heard at the hospital: “They originally told us two choices: dead or vegetable. Which is not something you want to hear.”
“My sign is an X-ray of my head,” Jay Crandell told me. “It unfortunately shows the bullet.” Jay was shot in the head while walking down the street in Richmond, Va., on July 4th, 2006. His father, Joe, says it was probably random, “celebratory” gunfire. 1/ #MarchForOurLives https://t.co/wXt10NVGqG

Russia will appeal #IOC ban to the Court of Arbitration for Sport. Russia's sports federations call the ban "shocking," "insulting," "unprofessional," motivated by politics.
Russia's doping program was "an unprecedented attack on the integrity of the Olympic Games and sport," says #IOC President Thomas Bach, announcing the sanctions.
There will be no Russian anthem, no medals awarded to Russia, no Russian officials at February's Games in South Korea.
"Clean" Russian athletes can petition to compete but under neutral flag.
