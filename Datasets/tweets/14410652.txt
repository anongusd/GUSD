With a trade war ratcheting up today, it is imperative to make it more difficult to raise anti-growth tariffs that will only prolong the war and stall the economy.
When an administration is given too much latitude to determine what is a “national security threat”, it is inevitable that overreach will occur.
Conservatives and liberals should support this. It helps reclaim Congress’s authority on this issue.

Fact-checking @HillaryClinton : Neutral experts say her plan is a massive tax increase.

Taxes hurt everyone. America needs a tax system that puts more money back in the pockets of every American.
Let's just lower rates across the board instead of engineering breaks
