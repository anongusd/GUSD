Insulin is not a drug so stop calling it that. It is what a healthy pancreas secretes naturally. It is what keeps me alive. It should not cost anything. Type 1 diabetes already costs me pain. It shouldn‚Äôt cost me my paycheck too. #insulin4all.

If #T1D was a time, it would be the Great Depression, If #TypeOneDiabetes was a movie it would be The Room. If it was table it would be a wobbly one. If it was a friend, it would be the one who forgot your birthday #DavidtheDiabetic
If #T1D was a drink it would be a bottom shelf tequila. If #TypeOneDiabetes was a night, it would be one of freezing rain. If it was a disaster, it would be Pompei. #DavidTheDiabetic
