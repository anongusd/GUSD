"20% of students faced one of the worst outcomes after attending, ultimately defaulting on their loans within just THREE YEARS of leaving an ECA school..."
"A high proportion of students left #ECA with unmanageable debt. In fact, of the	68,844 students who left an ECA school in 2012-2013 and entered repayment on their federal debt, only ONE IN FIVE were able to pay down even $1 on their loan principal three years later..."
"Taxpayers will also have to bear the upcoming costs of @usedgov obligation to grant 'closed school discharges' of existing student loans held by current ECA students who do not transfer to a comparable program at a new school."
BREAKING: The warning signs were there but no one did anything. In our latest Issue Brief VES identified six signs #ECA was in trouble but @usedgov and @DeptVetAffairs failed to take action. Now 4K #GIBill students are displaced. Read the report: https://t.co/cMHSkZud5B

The differences in age, gender, family status, disability status, employment, and others are key factors selective institutions must learn to better attract more undergraduate student veterans.
Selective institutions must be knowledgeable about this disparity to become more veteran-ready and attract prospective student veterans.
We explore demographic differences b/ween undergrad v. grad to better ID factors contributing to the disparity and interventions to increase undergrad representation.

#Veterans oppose #PROSPERAct b/c it would eliminate the Gainful Employment Rule, which ensures financial aid is only going to schools that produce strong student outcomes. Its elimination would waste taxpayer money and hurt student veterans. #GoodBill4BadSchools #HEA	Reason #8

Francheska Salazar: I decided to choose a community college. I did not want to go to a 4-year university where I sat in a room full of 120 people in a classroom. I'd gone to #CommunityCollege before the military, and I wanted to have that kind of sense of community... https://t.co/x4xHfvKwi1
