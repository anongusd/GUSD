A news channel that professes to be impartial should be objective &amp; non-partisan. Some CNN anchors are, some aren't. https://t.co/PB0gCxhE4X
Totally agree. https://t.co/aP3LtWTG0f
I watch all US cable news networks, regularly. 	They're all now highly partisan. https://t.co/nMkdNm7F1x
Actually, yes. Maybe you guys don't appreciate just how partisan your news coverage has become? 	And I say that as someone who worked at CNN, likes CNN, &amp; still regularly watches CNN. 	I'm staggered by the level of unrestrained anti-Trump bias. https://t.co/5npWNwN4Kj
Oh come off it Mr Darcy.... a lot of CNN's coverage of Trump has been overtly partisan against him.	Some of your anchors pride themselves on openly sneering at everything he says or does. 	Entirely their right, but let's not pretend you guys have any high ground on impartiality. https://t.co/wYN1OuXzdM

An absolute legend - truly. https://t.co/bj1d70aqX9
You HAVE to start with @Aubameyang7 in a North London Derby. 	He's our main man, not a bloody bench-warmer. 	Jeez, Unai - I like you, but what are you doing?   #THFCvAFC https://t.co/fWMMfvCGe9
No Torreira either??	He was brilliant against Spurs when we beat them at Emirates.	Not happy with this starting line-up - Emery taking a huge gamble. https://t.co/lqAbqSIpju
I'm hearing neither Aubameyang nor Ozil are starting today. 	I don't want to hear this. 	#NLD #THFCvAFC

I said on @GMB this morning that Churchill was a complex, flawed man who made mistakes.

Yes! BLOCKED. https://t.co/Hqk7bFy01e
👍I’m not defending all the stories about Sterling. I just don’t think they’ve been racially motivated. He’s just good copy like the other players I mentioned... who happen to be white. https://t.co/eGcA1bdxfb
It’s not. This kind of abuse is never acceptable, on a football pitch or anywhere else. But when it’s racially motivated, as it was yesterday, it’s even worse. https://t.co/XBZTaZNNbq
Yes he did, and I respect him for it. But I have the same right to challenge his claim that media coverage of black footballers is racist. It’s not. https://t.co/jLkImxvZdn
‘White man crusade’? 	What on earth are you talking about? 	Be better informed please. 	I’ve vehemently condemned the vile racism aimed at Sterling &amp; other black players from the kind of morons we saw yesterday. 	I just don’t agree the media coverage of him/them is racist. https://t.co/HfL1WxlwGp
Why can’t Kanye have an opinion about cheese that’s just as valid as anybody else’s? https://t.co/BNfU5oblAZ
The journalist who wrote the @MailOnline story that Raheem Sterling says shows media racist bias vs black footballers has explained why this is wrong. 	His tweets today are worth reading: @AnthonyRJoseph
I've said the racist abuse Sterling got at Chelsea yesterday was disgusting &amp; the culprit should be banned for life. 	I don't agree with Sterling that media coverage of black players is racist. https://t.co/G5aY5prYB0
Are they though?	Which stories about Sterling have been unique to him &amp; 'racist'? 	All those guys got similar treatment with endless 'trivial' headlines about their lifestyles. 	Racist hooligans were responsible for the abuse Raheem got yesterday, not the media. https://t.co/c15bZTMaZ0
Where have I condoned racism? 	I despise racism. https://t.co/iqbohIheYJ
If I used the phrase ‘typical black man response’, I would (rightly) be fired. As for Sterling’s post, I know exactly what it was about. I just don’t agree with him that the media’s coverage of black players is racist. https://t.co/aD6tLRsaR6

No, I’m just challenging the Twitter mob opinion because I don’t happen to agree with it. I believe this is still permitted, even in the PC-crazed world we now endure? https://t.co/9RaGGFBPVC
I just tweeted why the two stories were angled differently. I see no ‘racism’ here whatsoever. https://t.co/rsEtvUtpd3
I’d love to. https://t.co/ThzuGV9T5P
No, there's another difference:	Tosin bought a £2.25m house despite never playing a Premier League game for City. 	Whereas Foden has played PL &amp; CL games &amp; starred for England U21. 	So it's not surprising Foden could afford it.	That's the difference. 	Where's the 'racism'? https://t.co/QzyJe6otWH
None of these stories is racist.	They'd all have been written about Rooney, Beckham etc. 	To pretend otherwise is absurd. https://t.co/Ic88yTbMD5
Swap 'Rooney' for 'Sterling' in all the headlines everyone's tweeting, and tell me they're still 'racist'. Both have received the same intense media treatment (good &amp; bad) because England's best footballers sell papers. 	They also use the media to promote &amp; enrich themselves..
@henrywinter @GMB ok thanks.
I did. https://t.co/O14S1FDzQT

I believe so, yes. He certainly would have done from me. https://t.co/F847NIHP9T
RT @rickygervais: Is it today? https://t.co/OagsjuGnCh
Exactly.	I've seen no difference in the way Sterling is treated (good &amp; bad) to white football stars like Gazza, Beckham &amp; George Best etc. https://t.co/9QIoOjHV7c
We'll definitely debate this on tomorrow's show. 	For the record, I think @sterling7 is the best English player in the country &amp; the abuse meted out to him at Chelsea yesterday was disgusting. https://t.co/fXoObUr8d3
There's a perfectly valid argument that many of the Sterling stories are trivial.	That doesn't make them racist. 	Many Gazza stories were trivial, but he, like Sterling, sold papers. https://t.co/EwRaLNUpXn
Henry, do you honestly believe newspapers have unfairly targeted Sterling because he's black? https://t.co/Oe2AijjVnx

People now RT-ing this thread again. To which I would argue - which of these stories about Sterling wouldn't have also appeared about Gazza? 	(many versions of them did!) 	Where is the racism? 	To blame media for yesterday &amp; not that racist Chelsea scumbag gives him an excuse. https://t.co/LNYCfZ5br0
Hmmm. 	Not sure about this. 	I think Sterling gets the most media attention because he's England's best player, not because of his skin colour.	White superstars like Gazza got exactly the same OTT treatment - good, bad &amp; sometimes ugly. https://t.co/TV38uC078o

EU chiefs must be laughing their smug heads off at the state of Britain's hapless Brexit bungling. 	They've got us right where they wanted us: weak, vulnerable &amp; with a plan that's nowhere near what people actually voted for in the Referendum. 	One word, Mrs May: PATHETIC.
