The Anti-Lynching Bill in itself is an absurdity. I mean, is lynching in modern America a misdemeanor or something, some nefarious grey zone crime that would slip by the media and federal law enforcement unnoticed? It‚Äôs already a death penalty crime FFS!!
The @KamalaHarris connection to #JussieSmollette is a disturbing one. What a coincidence that crafty beavers from two cities a thousand miles apart would be involved in fake lynching hustles.

When the Democrats are in a position to open the floodgates, America will cease to exist. Between fraudulent voting and simple overbreeding, the United States will succumb to open borders, Sharia law, socialism, government excessive regulation, and rescinding of Second Amendment.
Final word on this pathetic loser selling himself as a victim: I hear people of all colors and differing heritage practice racism everyday, unconsciously, just jokes and innuendos, etc. The real tragedy of the #JussieHoax, if true, is that racism will be more ignored as a result.

It seems silly, but I play in poker tournaments and golf tournaments. If I win a prize now, I can simply put it in the charity. And donations to the charity are partially or totally tax deductible, I believe, depending on local laws. The overseer Foundation helps with all that.
I started with a minimal amount to test the waters and then the process was so easy with the good people at the Rhode Island Foundation, I‚Äôm working on building the fund. Leaving it in my will is now so simple.
But you can set up a fund for a hospital or a cause or an institution. Some people simply want their loved ones remembered. You could then just name, say, the Salvation Army or the American Cancer Society perhaps. It‚Äôs so fulfilling to be thinking about charity and your loved one
After Mike died, I was helping my niece register at college. The financial aid people go through thousands of scholarships that a student might qualify for. We made our fund really simple: a partial scholarship for a history major that he or she can use with other scholarships.
I‚Äôm setting that up next! Btw I‚Äôm not asking for donations on Twitter, as I feel that can get a bit sketchy. I see too much chicanery on social media. I‚Äôm just sharing a really rewarding way I found to cherish loved ones who are in our hearts. https://t.co/KYVIrh78qj
You now have a place to leave part of your estate as well. It was a wonderful way to move from grief to fond remembrance designing a fund. You pick a topic that resonates with a loved one‚Äôs memory. Then the Foundation works with you to pick a beneficiary.
You can start a Donor Advised Fund like the Rhode Island Foundation with minimal funding, and then build it as life goes on. Often people will ask what you want for a birthday or such. Now you can say a small donation to my parents‚Äô memorial fund, thank you!
I learned a lot about setting up memorial funds with the help of Pam at the Rhode Island Foundation. If you wish to honor a loved one, the tax laws and regulations can be daunting. These bigger foundations will accept smaller family funds under their umbrella and do all the work!
Thank you. https://t.co/0Ed4ZuLH6N

Just the opposite. I love engaging with people who think differently than I. In my experience on Twitter, however, liberals only seem to know how to disagree with venom.

Marlon Brando called me on the phone once to talk about doing a film together. I thought it had to be a friend pulling a prank, so I hung up on him. True story. We later straightened it out. https://t.co/RGqzTIb40o

#ScaryMovie2 was hands down the most fun I had making a movie. #KeenenIvoryWayans asked me if I would be willing to do the movie immediately to replace Marlon Brando, who had gotten ill. They had a release deadline. We shot it in four days over a weekend. @AndyRichter was a blast https://t.co/w6utL1eHkz

Not only was it ad-libbed, but the producer, Jerry Weintraub (a larger-than-life character and a great friend) bet me money that it would never be in the movie. He pointed out that he controlled the editing.  After a test screening, I was five bucks richer! #TheSpecialist https://t.co/FdDVrXb8uV
I have to confess I didn‚Äôt get it when @SethMacFarlane and I were recording it. I guess I was like Margaret Dumont or something! When I saw it put together, however, naturally I laughed out loud.

The Maitland PD are checking everywhere. I gave them my number. Andrew was following me, so I thought maybe he would like to talk some things over. They‚Äôre going to give him my number if they find him and we can just talk until sunrise. A new day always helps. https://t.co/mKmCw1sHkk
If only Andrew could see the THOUSANDS of fellow Americans who are pulling for him. It‚Äôs like he‚Äôs lost behind enemy lines and we are cheering him home, willing him to survive. Andrew, do this for the ‚Äúother 21‚Äù vets a day who don‚Äôt make it home from the darkness. Stay alive!
Andrew wasn‚Äôt at his home address. @PoliceMaitland is getting assistance from neighboring agencies. They are really on this.
Okay. Just talked to Maitland Police.  The dispatch supervisor there was terrific. He‚Äôs confident they will find him. I gave Billy, the dispatcher, Andrew‚Äôs home address and the info a reliable source DMed me. They are all over this.
He‚Äôs in Maitland. Calling PD there now.
Hello, @OrlandoPolice. A man named Andrew MacMasters just said on @Twitter that he is sitting in a parking lot and is going to kill himself. He‚Äôs sitting with his dog, a black lab, possibly in a WalMart parking lot. Can you do a #WelfareCheck? He is a Marine Vet. His tweet: https://t.co/8DwqWVVkhC
Did he make any reference to where he was in Orlando? A park, or a bar, or any specific reference?
His entire account is closed down. I‚Äôm told I can no longer DM him.
So I‚Äôm see that Andrew‚Äôs tweet has been deleted. Andrew, don‚Äôt feel embarrassed that you reached out in the darkness. Nobody thinks you‚Äôre foolish for that. You know every one of us reaching out to you right now has some depression, too. I‚Äôll say it. I do.
I‚Äôm driving cross country. Sitting in a motel room. I have all night. I know that sounds dorky, but here I am! I would love to talk. Just talk. I won‚Äôt push you into anything. https://t.co/LVnLT5DeEB
So think about this. A lot of vets, I understand, have come to where you are tonight. If you could just push this decision off tonight, at least, maybe you would also inspire another vet to seek help. You could save another man, too. By waiting to do this. https://t.co/L5NiEbQv5j
I‚Äôm following you now, so you can DM me. We can talk privately. Or we can talk openly right here. Lot of people worried about you right now. https://t.co/LVnLT5DeEB
Someone said you‚Äôre Andrew. In Orlando? Im not trying to trap you. Let‚Äôs just talk. You also have your dog. Your little schnoot. Boy or girl? https://t.co/LVnLT5DeEB
We can talk. I don‚Äôt care what anybody thinks. Do you? Let‚Äôs have a conversation. Just you you and I. https://t.co/0ZD0YU6pFx

Hey, James, have you checked #Chico airport. There are literally hundreds of #LostPets there. Always a chance a firefighter grabbed #Splinter and dropped him off there. #CampFireJamesWoods https://t.co/YpnFpy6U24

Gail Woods enlisted in the United States Navy shortly after Pearl Harbor. He served gallantly as a ‚ÄúFighting SeaBee‚Äù in the South Pacific, and was the recipient of two Purple Hearts. Later in life he re-enlisted in the United States Army, and fought in Korea. I honor him today. https://t.co/yqDu97FYKN
My friend Kathryn Segura has worked for the welfare of animals all her life. She sent me this photo of Stanley, here having found safe harbor. I‚Äôm guessing this will become an iconic image of the #CaliforniaWildfires #SoCalFiresJamesWoods #CampFireJamesWoods https://t.co/CGkh0gmbwz
Dear followers, as you all know, I am usually hesitant to recommend #donation sites, because sadly there are scammers everywhere. This morning, however, I pinned to my profile a list recommended by @waltmossberg. I can vouch for him 100%. #CampFireJamesWoods #SoCalFiresJamesWoods
RT @waltmossberg: Here‚Äôs a list of organizations to which you can donate funds to help victims of, and firefighters battling, the horrendou‚Ä¶
In high school I wrote a newspaper column with my dear friend, @waltmossberg. He went on to become a great journalist. Last night he asked how he could help, being so far away. He researched and asked me to share this info.üëá Good man! #CampFireJamesWoods  #SoCalFiresJamesWoods https://t.co/uYVkfoG3DP
My dear friend from high school, journalist Walter Mossberg (@waltmossberg) just sent me a lovely message. His request: is there a reliable #fund set up so generous people far away (like Walt) can send money to help? Ideas, anybody? #CampFireJamesWoods #SoCalFiresJamesWoods
#HelpfulHint: 1) Bring your domestic #pets inside. While you can‚Äôt sense it as much, the smoke and ash is extremely irritating to their extreme sensibilities. 2) Leave a big bucket of water outside for deer and other wildlife who will be parched by the fires. #CampFireJamesWoods
#HelpfulHint: Here‚Äôs an idea that helps first responders: when you evacuate, leave a sign in your window that you are ‚Äúsafe and gone,‚Äù so firefighters can save time and check the next abode. ##CampFireJamesWoods #SoCalFiresJamesWoods https://t.co/tzX5NFeFAZ
Remember: winds can shift erratically, so have evacuation needs prepared. When ordered to go, go! Conditions can change rapidly. Leave an outgoing message on your cellphone, so people will know your status, even if your battery dies. #CampFireJamesWoods #SoCalFiresJamesWoods

Animals like #cats and #dogs often hide in fires. If there is the remotest possibility that you may have to evacuate in the future, locate and secure your #pets now. Make sure you have food, water, and a cage, if possible. Shelters prefer them. #SoCalFiresJamesWoods
In the desperate circumstance where your horses must be freed in the fires (NEVER leave them penned up), spray paint your phone number on the horse. Crude but effective. #SoCalFiresJamesWoods

She needs help with five horses. It was previously reported that her horses had been evacuated, but she says that did not happen. Please contact her at @Alyssa_Milano to get her location or use my hashtag #SoCalFiresJamesWoods This  is a serious request. https://t.co/R7krd0Wfbg
Oh, and we (followers and responders) have all been working for fourteen hours while you are in your basement sniping. We couldn‚Äôt care less about ‚Äúcredit.‚Äù We just want to disseminate life-saving information. #INSTABLOCK https://t.co/IMh04YhG95
It is a way to focus on just missing persons rather than a generic hashtag that is overwhelming. It worked very well in the #CampFire and took pressure off the official sites that were swamped. The reason I use my personal feed to retweet info is that 2 million people see it. https://t.co/IMh04YhG95

There were some requests for people with boats to help evacuate people from Malibu using Paradise Cove. I‚Äôm can‚Äôt vouch for how accurate that is. It makes sense knowing how congested PCH must be. ##SoCalFiresJamesWoods

When tweeting info on missing loved ones, please give name, address (or just town), special needs or conditions, and YOUR contact info (phone number or @Twitter handle) with either hashtag (see belowüëá)Thank you. https://t.co/7NZUP3ih1M
For twelve hours we have been using two dedicated hashtags (#CampFireJamesWoods,  #SoCalFiresJamesWoods) so people can coordinate finding each other on my @Twitter feed. Just tweet info on missing persons using a hashtag by geography or search for those missing the same way.

It‚Äôs possible to forget a pet in the chaos of emergency evacuation. Grab your animal and food and water and a cage, if you have it. Shelters prefer caged animals. #Pets #CampFireJamesWoods

In case you wonder whether #Democrats truly care about the plight of women, Keith Ellison was elected chief law enforcement official of his state.
Black Americans vote like the rest of Americans, I believe. Given job opportunities, tax cuts, and viable healthcare, we are ALL -black, white, Hispanic, Jewish, Christian, etc., etc. - going to vote for the Party that provides those things. https://t.co/m0WZ4X9Bwp
Interesting and probably accurate assessment. https://t.co/giS7gz1XSU
Republicans, underestimate @NancyPelosi at your peril. It is imperative that Hispanic-American voters are welcomed into the Republican tent with job opportunities and tax cuts and healthcare. Republicans must get the message across to this ESSENTIAL voting bloc.
True, and a cautionary event that RINO‚Äôs absolutely need to heed going into 2020. #PartyUnity is inevitably the key to victory for either side. Trump did create cohesion in the Senate races, however. https://t.co/NKeTfmJwdW

This is true, like it or not. She managed to eke out a House win, and stopped Republicans from landslides where they should have had them.

Now that Democrats control the House, #IllegalImmigration will be rampant, indeed encouraged, #VoterFraud will be off the charts, and the Republicans will be absolutely helpless to stop it. For yesterday‚Äôs conservatives who didn‚Äôt vote, you‚Äôre going to get what you deserve.
I guarantee that Republicans who didn‚Äôt vote this time, will finally figure it out in 2020. Two years of nonsense hearings with screeching Democrats will remind them why you can never take success for granted. It‚Äôll be Kavanaugh-level hatred and shenanigans 24/7. Next time, vote!
This country will be so sick of @NancyPelosi by 2020, Trump will sweep and Congress will go red.

#Democrats have promoted this for decades. At the present moment there are 30,000,000 legal immigrants residing in the United States and more than 11,000,000 illegal aliens as well.
