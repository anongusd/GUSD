RT @KosherSoul: Dear Tweeps: help an author out; could you please help me retweet this to 1,000 to give it a push? I wrote this book to uni‚Ä¶
@KosherSoul It would be an honor. We will go to some great spots.
@KosherSoul That‚Äôs an amazing honor. Congratulations.
@DanielGullotta I wrote a paper on Othello, Witchcraft, and Elizabethan England a couple years ago. Wish I had that Yates book at the time...
Does anyone have any information on how widely known authors like Bede and Geoffrey of Monmouth were in 18 c. America? Broadly stated I am doing research on the US as an empire and its ideological roots.
@KosherSoul I've been very well, thank you! I've been researching and cooking for the most part and enjoying every minute of it. Hope things are well with you! I'm still inspired by your presentation a few weeks back, it gave me fuel.
@HerbertHistory I was usually in LC ;)
@HerbertHistory W&amp;MQ Oct. 2016. Samuel Fisher's "Fit Instruments in a Howling Wilderness". Good article on the Declaration of Independence and Native Americans.
If anyone knows how I can find a copy of:	Gary D. Olson, "The Soderstrom Incident: A Reflection upon Federal-State Relations under the Articles of Confederation," New-York Historical Society Quarterly 55 (April 1971): 109-18		I would be eternally grateful
@RBrookhiser Alan Taylor's "American Colonies" would be my vote. Patricia Bonomi's "Under the Cope of Heaven" is about religion specifically but how religion affected society in general.
@RBrookhiser William Rehnquist's chapter on Taney in "The Supreme Court" was also more positive than expected
Got this exciting work in the mail today! @KosherSoul https://t.co/eXBmkNVPo8
@anthonybreretn @madefromROME @english_maven A U of M classics prof one said "Gladiator takes place on Earth in a place called Rome but it's not our Earth and it's not our Rome" haha
@anthonybreretn @madefromROME @english_maven Your beat me to the response hahaha
@kylegriffin1 This is gross
@lizcovart @davidsilkenat Well deserved, congratulations!

@TheTattooedProf I was wondering last night how professors of CV/R are going alter their approach if at all.
@Ladbree @OmowaleAfrika @Craigs_VCR This seems decent: https://t.co/Eiw4WTpkXj
@scsclassics @rogueclassicist Language skills too if you work Latin &amp; Greek into the curriculum.
@TheTattooedProf The Winter of our discontent...
@kylekraj @MetroATLDSA Cooler than a polar bear's toenails...
@SheProblematic @Sabmerk @patcamp12 @YesYoureRacist ... does not accept their abhorrent beliefs.
@SheProblematic @Sabmerk @patcamp12 @YesYoureRacist Publicly Shaming these people for their disgusting beliefs is the most efficient way of eradicating racism because it shows that society...
@jbf1755 Great tune, unfortunate meeting
@qjurecic Paul Nitze's kid wrote the book "The Hawk and the Dove" about Nitze and Kennen. I remember that encounter from that book. Crazy stuff...
@qjurecic Relevent: https://t.co/2Mm0JYOqBD
@LorenRaeDeJ *Vinho Verde... if he's going to insult he should at least listen to the podcast ü§£
@lizcovart thank you sincerely for the beautiful shirt! I hope it spreads the word of your great podcast even further! https://t.co/lctKFZh2nF
Great article in the latest W&amp;M Quarterly. https://t.co/2xgF8sEXI3
I'm going to step away from current events today... https://t.co/CbDOjNhG2m
@lizcovart I would like to purchase a Large if still available
@LawDavF This is why I feel like Christopher Sly...
@AdamSerwer We in Minnesota were waiting for this after Philando Castile...
@Strackman_APUSH @RBrookhiser I like this question because war with France doesn't seem to be the primary concern. Stabilizing the N. American claims seems primary.
@TylerBoliver @RBrookhiser I can't speak to the counter factual.
@TylerBoliver @RBrookhiser The French were sending munitions and funds covertly through their shell corporation Hortelez &amp; Co. earlier than the 1778 accord.
Refreshing these great books on this gloomy day. Great reading. https://t.co/KPtokZp4pf
@lizcovart @SmithsonianMag Or "Good and Bad Feelings" if you are Daniel Walker Howe
@laurenfturek Thanks!
Beginning this book today. Two chapters in and already a lot of fun. https://t.co/j9IVCP201t
@jbf1755 Feels weird clicking a "‚ù§Ô∏è" in response to this message
@agordonreed @lithub If you want to play an instrument you listen to as much music as possible; if you want to write you read and examine all you can.
@JohnFea1 It's too bad, I contribute monthly (albeit meagerly, on a student's budget) and wish more would do the same.
@lizcovart @declarationres 27, 28 if you include "Nor have we been wanting in Attentions to our British Brethren..." which is a paragraph of further grievances imo.
