To re-cap Trump's presser:	-- Still very supportive of Kavanaugh but a lot riding on hearing	-- Rosenstein meeting may get delayed	-- Trump refused to meet with Trudeau at #UNGA	-- Kim Jong Un sent Trump 2 "beautiful letters"	-- Per Trump, healthcare tougher deal than Middle East

White House very much sticking with Kavanaugh today, after third accuser comes forward with allegations of sexual misconduct. But he'll have to come off very credibly at the hearing tomorrow to make it to a vote, sources tell me:	https://t.co/O3EUknWEDG
A second source familiar w/the Kavanaugh confirmation process says WH is sticking with Kavanaugh but did say tomorrow's hearing was "make or break for him. If he does not come across as credible, he is done."
To clarify this quote — because I’ve gotten some q’s on it— source was saying it is not possible to behave that way at 17 and go on to have such a successful life: https://t.co/gj942Plcus
One R close to the Kavanaugh confirmation process just told me this after the third allegation of sexual misconduct came out --&gt;		“You can’t be a rapist and alcoholic at the age of 17 and then years later, become a highly accomplished person.”

White House tried to make the signing of NDAs a condition for employment and early on, many officials did sign the agreement particularly since WH lawyers pushed it. BUT some staffers fell through the cracks, given the chaos of the first 100 days &amp; constant turnover.
