@reclinerpilot @HouseGOP Yeah, that's what we're afraid of.
@HouseGOP We really want you to oust the #trumpcrimefamily from the whitehouse, but for some reason you won't put country over party. #kompromat
@GOP @realDonaldTrump And the kickbacks. The kickbacks will be so beautiful!  So many beautiful kickbacks! #TrumpCrimeFamily #grifters #Trumpville
@ScottWalker As governor you are responsible to all the people of Wisconsin, the US Constitution, and upholding democracy --not "conservative values"
@ScottWalker Yes! Thank you @EricHolder for keeping walker and the GOP from destroying democracy!
@ScottWalker Yes, that's the plan! Thank you @EricHolder !
@HouseGOP Well, until the health insurance increases kick in.

@HouseGOP @cathymcmorris Is that a typo? Didn't you mean the GUN CONTROL LAW?
@IvankaTrump @WSJ Is this really a "personal page?" It feels like the product of a media team--photographers, writers, sm, etc-- and I have to wonder who is paying them. I hope not the USG.
