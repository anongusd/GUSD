The good news? We know what works. We need to tackle the root causes of migration from Central American countries, not merely the symptoms at our border. We must address the violence and humanitarian crisis in the Northern Triangle forcing families to seek refuge in the U.S.
Just yesterday, President Trump declared a national emergency for his manufactured crisis at the U.S. Southern border. But if President Trump wants to actually get serious about addressing migration, then we need long-term and comprehensive solutions.
At a time when immigration and border security talks are heightened, it‚Äôs important to learn more about the places that the migrants arriving at our U.S. Southern border are coming from. And that‚Äôs what we‚Äôre here to do.
Unfortunately, many Guatemalans seek to flee their homes and make the dangerous journey to the U.S. due to violence, poverty, and lack of rule of law in their country.

These are some of the common sense ideas that I believe both my Democratic and Republican colleagues stand ready and willing to discuss further, @realDonaldTrump, as soon as our government is open for business.
And, just last week, even @USChamber acknowledged that the way to seriously address migration to our border is to provide aid to the Northern Triangle countries in Central America ‚Äî Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador ‚Äî and fully fund the Alliance for Prosperity.
There has already been unanimous agreement in the Senate about providing funding for important border security. There is also bipartisan agreement about providing permanent protections and a pathway to legal status for Dreamers and Temporary Protected Status recipients.
Many of my colleagues and I have been steeped in these issues for years. We know the ins and outs and have had success finding areas of agreement in the past. We can do it again. But we cannot hold federal workers, their families and their paychecks hostage in the meantime.
.@realDonaldTrump there is one way to end this shutdown: re-open the government. Once that happens, we can have serious and substantive discussions about securing our borders and fixing our broken immigration system.

.@realDonaldTrump has created his own narrative to suit his political purposes. For the rest of us, facts still matter. And we cannot discuss his trip to the border today without highlighting the truth about border security.
If @realDonaldTrump was truly interested in a solution, he would fund the Alliance for Prosperity which helps to create economic growth and opportunities in Central America so that families don‚Äôt have to flee their homeland in search of safety https://t.co/nGxUMYfGde
Shamefully, we‚Äôve focused more on ways to keep migrants out of our country rather than helping them address the misery in their homelands ‚Äì misery we‚Äôve helped create and are complicit in due to our appetite for illegal drugs
The Northern Triangle countries of Guatemala, El Salvador and Honduras are some of the most dangerous in the world. I've seen firsthand the conditions that force so many to flee for their lives. Instead of a photo-op, @realDonaldTrump should be going to Central America.
FACT #11 (and the most important one): The overwhelming majority of migrants arriving at our southern border are not criminals trying to evade border patrol officers. They are families fleeing unspeakable violence in Central America who are surrendering and asking for help.
As my friend @LeaderHoyer rightly pointed out, Republicans who are knowledgeable about border security have repeatedly acknowledged that a physical barrier is not an effective or cost-efficient solution https://t.co/qMA7zGnzx9
FACT #10: The notion that a wall is not a smart investment is not just a position held by Democrats and those who work along our border every single day. Republicans think so, too.
.@USCG provides helicopters, aircraft, and fast boats for our border that are vital to interdicting drugs headed for our communities. @TSA deploys agents to patrol airports and mass transit hubs for suspicious activity, looking to prevent attacks. They are crucial to our security
FACT #9: By shutting down our government and forcing the men and women in the Coast Guard and TSA to work not knowing if or when they‚Äôll get paid, @realDonaldTrump is actually putting our security at risk.
FACT #8: Congress has already funded 650 miles of fencing along our southern border in places where it actually makes sense. @realDonaldTrump should listen to experts and those on the frontlines who know that there are many places along our border where a wall won‚Äôt work.
Unfortunately, @realDonaldTrump refused to take yes for an answer and chose, instead, to reject the same funding levels he agreed to last year‚Äîand needlessly shut down our government
FACT #7: Democrats and Republicans have provided this administration with border security funding. Over the last 2 years, Congress has appropriated $1.7 billion for border security. In December, the Senate voted 100-0 to provide an ADDITIONAL $1.6 billion https://t.co/s2YiaEcxEb
And despite @realDonaldTrump‚Äôs repeated promises that Mexico would pay for it, the cost of his ineffective, 2,000-mile border wall will ultimately fall to American taxpayers.
FACT #6: @realDonaldTrump wants $5.7 billion for a wall right now, but that will merely be a down payment. His own @DHSgov estimates that the wall could cost around $21 billion to complete ‚Äì not including maintenance, operations or cost of acquiring land https://t.co/FCAOWpjy0Z
According to @realDonaldTrump's own Drug Enforcement Administration, most illegal drugs come into our country through legal ports of entry. A border wall will not keep deadly drugs like heroin out of our communities https://t.co/ule8lM9qcU
FACT #5: @realDonaldTrump keeps repeating a misleading claim that drugs are pouring into our country through the border. Fact check: my report with @senrobportman reveals the deadliest drug in the U.S. is mostly getting in through the U.S. Postal Service. https://t.co/DuffUxz4O5
According to @GAO‚Äôs report, between fiscal years 2010 and 2015, @CBP recorded a total of 9,287 breaches in pedestrian fencing. It is clear that a wall is not a silver bullet for securing our border.
FACT #4: Our country‚Äôs independent watchdog could not determine a barrier‚Äôs real security benefit. @GAO made clear that migrants have cut through fencing, burrowed under fencing, used a ramp to drive over fencing, and simply jumped over fencing https://t.co/vx28SOgKF6
FACT #3: For years now, more Mexicans have been leaving the U.S. to return to Mexico than have arrived in our country. https://t.co/YiqqZ3UUlR
FACT #2: Despite @realDonaldTrump‚Äôs claim that we have a new crisis at our border, the investments that Democrats and Republicans have made to secure our border over the years have paid off.	 	Apprehensions at the southern border are down 82% since 2000. https://t.co/kTE6PRqR4r
These technologies cost a lot less than building a wall‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääand, unlike @realDonaldTrump‚Äôs steel barrier, they have actually proven effective. https://t.co/FkCHiUQ4MI
Technologies like radar, drones, underground sensors and aircraft are smart investments that help agents perform their mission and get better results along our borders.
FACT #1: Border patrol officers have made clear time and time again that technology ‚Äì not a wall ‚Äì is the key to securing our border. David Aguilar, former @CBP deputy told senators ‚ÄúTechnology is going to be the highest need the border patrol has.‚Äù https://t.co/MnVeGAFJQk

As Governor of Delaware, I nominated dozens of men and women to serve as judges. What I looked for the most was truthfulness and judicial temperament. What we saw last week was not acceptable for a judge on the Delaware Court of Common Pleas, let alone our nation's highest court.
Even if my Republican colleagues don‚Äôt want to believe Dr. Ford, and even if they agree with Judge Kavanaugh‚Äôs judicial record, the fact that he came before this body and so brazenly misled our fellow senators should alone be disqualifying.
During his most recent hearing, Judge Kavanaugh answered several questions about his younger days in ways that were, at best, misleading and at worst lies under oath. 		These less than truthful answers point to a troubling pattern and raise serious questions about his credibility
Then, the Senate and the country was riveted by compelling and powerful testimony from a private citizen and victim, Dr. Christine Blasey-Ford, who came forward to share the most traumatic experience of her life.	 	She did so despite being ‚Äúterrified,‚Äù and she did so with courage
If confirmed, Judge Kavanaugh would be the next Scott Pruitt, except, unlike the former EPA Administrator, he could do a lot more damage over the course of a lifetime appointment.		Strictly based on his record, I was prepared to vote NO on his nomination. https://t.co/oU7oiw4liG
And I have yet to meet any American who doesn‚Äôt want their family to have clean air to breathe and safe water to drink. 	 	Judge Kavanaugh ‚Äì who has voted to weaken or block environmental protections 89% of the time ‚Äì may actually pose the greatest threat to our environment.
I believe Judge Kavanaugh‚Äôs extreme record on the bench stands in stark contrast to what the majority of Americans want:	- Protections for those with pre-existing conditions	- The freedom for women to make their own health care decisions	- Independent checks on executive power
We expect presidents to look for the best candidates. It's why the vetting process in the Senate should be serious and thoughtful and why nominees should strive to be above reproach.		This should be one of the toughest job interviews because the stakes are that high..
The stakes are always high when this chamber votes to confirm any President‚Äôs Supreme Court nominee ‚Äì as they should be. This is a lifetime appointment to the highest court in our land.	 	Those that serve on the Court make decisions that affect the lives of millions of Americans.
I‚Äôll be speaking on the Senate floor about why I‚Äôm voting against Judge Kavanaugh. Watch live here: https://t.co/MWzc1oLEt7
Americans are right to be concerned about the nomination of Brett Kavanaugh for endless reasons, but we can't forget about what his confirmation would mean for our environment and public health. Here‚Äôs a quick rundown of what‚Äôs at stake: https://t.co/48V57aZdPA
I‚Äôve read the FBI report. 		‚ùå Dr. Ford wasn‚Äôt interviewed. 	‚ùå Dozens of people who know Dr. Ford, Ms. Ramirez and Brett Kavanaugh weren‚Äôt interviewed. 	‚ùå Brett Kavanaugh wasn‚Äôt interviewed.		It is clear this process was never designed to inform.

On the list of pre-existing conditions at risk under the Trump Administration: #diabetes. With 80,000 Delawareans suffering from it, we cannot stop fighting to #ProtectOurCare. Thanks to @JDRF_Delaware for leading the way https://t.co/4fLluz5LNm

This administration‚Äôs appetite for sabotaging Americans‚Äô access to #healthcare knows no bounds.	 	https://t.co/2Mrk1lpdxL
With the stakes so high and Americans' stances on these critical issues so clear, I say without hesitation: bring on this fight. #WhatsAtStake https://t.co/CbQpMrkrnJ
Overwhelmingly, the American people support:	- Protections for those with pre-existing conditions	- A woman‚Äôs right to choose	- LGBTQ protections	- Equal access to the voting booth	- Independent checks on executive power	- Access to clean air and clean water
Since 2006, Judge Kavanaugh has revealed his true colors, and his substantial record over that time period has proven to be a profound disappointment. It also stands in stark contrast to what the American people want
If Leader McConnell insists on rushing this nominee through before the American people can have their say in November, then the Senate must hold Judge Kavanaugh accountable for his deeply concerning record over the past 12 years on the bench
After leading an unprecedented and shameful yearlong blockade against Judge Merrick Garland ‚Äî an eminently qualified and consensus nominee ‚Äî Leader McConnell has now said that he wants the Senate to move swiftly to consider Judge Kavanaugh‚Äôs nomination
Picking a nominee to fill a vacancy on our nation‚Äôs highest court isn‚Äôt a reality show. It shouldn‚Äôt be a choice outsourced to ideologues like those at the Heritage Foundation or the Federalist Society. It should be a deliberative process, especially when the stakes are this high
I have urged Acting @EPA Administrator Wheeler to seize the opportunity he‚Äôs been given. He should work immediately to restore the public‚Äôs confidence in @EPA and carefully consider the lessons of the past. Read my letter here: https://t.co/Ipen2ifbG1
Like so many Americans, I am relieved to see Mr. Pruitt go, but my work to ensure @EPA is carrying out its fundamental mission ‚Äî protecting our environment and public health ‚Äî will not stop no matter who‚Äôs in charge.
Mr. Pruitt‚Äôs dangerous environmental policies were only matched by his complete disregard for American taxpayers. 		His resignation, though long overdue, is good news for our country and for our planet. https://t.co/mu0hT4g2dZ

Just a few #FarmBill18 wins: 		üêî Gives poultry farmers better access to conservation funds		üçÖ Creates new initiatives to make fruits and vegetables more affordable 		‚ôªÔ∏è Contains zero provisions that weaken environmental protections 		ü•¶ Provides funding for organic research
From improving SNAP and expanding crop insurance, to fighting the opioid epidemic and preserving support for conservation programs, the #FarmBill18 shows that when we work together, we can achieve bipartisan wins across the board
Every day, reporters risk their lives to bring us the news. But a newsroom shouldn‚Äôt ever feel like the front lines. How can we live in a country where our fellow citizens, by simply getting up and going to work, fall victim to such senseless tragedies? #Enough
When we talk about the Supreme Court, we often talk about precedent. Senator McConnell willingly chose to set a new precedent with his partisan blockade of Merrick Garland. The Senate should also wait until after the election before considering any nominee to fill this vacancy
The next Supreme Court justice will be the 'swing vote' on issues that impact every single American:	 	- voting rights	- reproductive rights	- civil rights	- workers' rights	- LGBTQ rights	- access to clean air and safe drinking water	 	The American people should get a say.
Among the First State victories in the 2018  #FarmBill is an amendment secured by @ChrisCoons and I ‚Äì giving Delaware farmers better access to conservations funds that will help them improve operations on their farms and protect our land and drinking water	https://t.co/MJWfCVF7CT
First State farmers make a small state like Delaware an agricultural powerhouse - #1 in the nation for value of products per acre. For consumers and the thousands of Delawareans growing crops and raising livestock every day, the bipartisan 2018 #FarmBill delivers major wins.
Merrick Garland was treated shamefully. It will be a long time before many of us forget that. https://t.co/am9Uxegamy
Only by addressing the underlying conditions in Central America - violence, corruption and lack of economic opportunity - can we end the crisis that leads so many to flee to our southern border. Today, @SenateDems announced our plan to do just that https://t.co/DW1QHqb0pW
Three years ago today, love won when #SCOTUS ruled that #MarriageEquality was finally the law of land. We‚Äôve come a long way, but our fight to end discrimination against our LGBTQ family and friends must continue. #EqualityForward https://t.co/qfsG3mJxUx
Unfortunately, the shameful and unprecedented obstruction that my Republican colleagues mounted in 2016 against Judge Merrick Garland has led to many deeply flawed decisions by the Supreme Court, including discriminatory policies like this #MuslimBan being upheld today
Despite today‚Äôs disappointing ruling, the facts remain the same: denying a group of people entry to this country on the sole basis of their religion and nationality is uninformed, un-American and unwise. Do not be fooled. This policy does not make our country safer.
Today, a majority of the Supreme Court mistakenly ignored what @POTUS himself has plainly told us time and time again -- this travel ban was born out of fear and hostility toward Muslims rather than any sort of national security strategy. #NoMuslimBanEver
This #NationalGIBillWeeek, it is imperative that we renew our commitment to making sure every veteran gets the most out of their hard-earned G.I. Bill benefits https://t.co/9damtNYVop

74 years ago today, President Roosevelt signed the #GIBill, one of the most groundbreaking pieces of legislation in the history of our country. It changed millions of lives ‚Äì including my own ‚Äì by spurring economic opportunity and helping to create the middle class as we know it
Located at the end of 'America's tailpipe,' First State families are forced to breathe dirtier air from upwind states and now @EPA wants to deny Delaware's request to cut this pollution. I submitted comments about Pruitt‚Äôs misguided decision to EPA today:  https://t.co/WtUOkFfzcf

Matthew 25 calls us to welcome strangers to our land. The Golden Rule urges us to treat others the way we want to be treated. And we have a moral obligation to address the violence migrants are fleeing in their home countries ‚Äì an obligation that @POTUS must also recognize

I again call on @POTUS to use his authority to unequivocally end his ‚Äúzero tolerance‚Äù policy and stop traumatizing families.
What‚Äôs more, the Administration‚Äôs failure to appropriately process asylum claims, and the extreme limits they have placed on asylum, means that families arriving at our border cannot go through the legal channels.
Unfortunately, his ‚Äúsolution‚Äù of detaining families arriving at our borders indefinitely without due process is almost as harmful‚Äîand has already been found illegal by the courts.
It only took 44 days, the ire of the world and irreversible trauma inflicted on over 2,300 innocent children for @POTUS to reverse his own despicable policy. https://t.co/RypN7N8Iap

We have a moral obligation to do far more to address the unimaginable violence in Central America that is causing families to flee their homes. Continuing to address the symptoms of the problem, rather than its root causes, ensures that we are complicit in their misery
I‚Äôm disappointed @USAGSessions appears not to have read Matthew 25, which calls us to welcome strangers in our land. What's happening at our borders right now isn't consistent with Matthew 25 or the teachings of any faith. The administration must end this heartbreaking policy now
Shame on those who dare to give lip service to #WorldRefugeeDay while simultaneously condoning -- either explicitly or with their silence -- a policy that rips apart families that are fleeing unspeakable violence
Today, a record 70 million people worldwide are in need of refuge. The Trump Administration has all but stalled acceptance of those who need our help the most. Far from making our country safer, this policy jeopardizes our ability to lead with moral clarity
Scripture calls us "to love those who are foreigners, for you yourselves were foreigners." We should recommit ourselves to that calling on #WorldRefugeeDay‚Äîand strive to live it out every single day of the year
I‚Äôm proud that every one of my Democratic colleagues has signed onto the bill ‚Äì but so far, not one Republican has joined.		I implore my Republican colleagues who say they oppose this inhumane policy: cosponsor this bill.		Platitudes won‚Äôt #EndFamilySeparation. We need action now

All the more reason Mr. Pruitt should release his public financial disclosure to the American people immediately. The public deserves answers now given all the scandals that keep emerging https://t.co/AzuAzYiQQ5

To #RiseAgainstHunger, I joined my House and Senate colleagues to pack meals for families in need around the globe. Roughly 8 million people in the world don't have enough food to live a healthy lifestyle. Thank you @KraftHeinzCo for working to change that and #EndHungerNow https://t.co/XaVq175Enk

More piping plovers have picked the beaches of Prime Hook NWR as their nesting place in recent years thanks not only to the fortified beaches, but also protections under the #EndangeredSpeciesAct. We should be strengthening ESA - not watering it down.
I was thrilled to also visit Prime Hook NWR today where $38 million in federal funds helped rebuild sand dunes and marsh areas devastated by Hurricane Sandy. The growth of wildlife here is a living testament to the power of effective collaboration and teamwork across government. https://t.co/6pj3s7adM2

Volunteers are integral to the conservation efforts at refuges here in Delaware and around the country: Over 40,000 volunteers contribute over 1.4 million hours to education and conservation efforts every year.

In 2015, I did something that not many senators I know have done: I sat down and read the #IranDeal. Everyone is entitled to their own opinions, but @POTUS isn‚Äôt entitled to his own facts on the #IranDeal, especially when used to purposefully mislead the American people https://t.co/ws4bP3Ziuq

I look forward to working with my colleagues in Congress on both sides of the aisle to get the bipartisan America‚Äôs Water Infrastructure Act across the finish line and make these investments in Delaware and across the country. https://t.co/V9EcWMqLYS
Water infrastructure ‚Äî like the dune systems protecting our beach communities, &amp; the treatment facilities &amp; pipelines that supply drinking water ‚Äî is crucial for Delaware. My bipartisan water resources bill will make smart, needed investments in our decades-old infrastructure.

Since 2010, we‚Äôve witnessed the longest-running economic expansion in our nation‚Äôs history. If we want this record growth to continue through 2018 and into the next decade, investments in our decades-old water infrastructure in Delaware and across the country will be crucial
From Rehoboth Beach to the Port of Wilmington and across the First State, water infrastructure - waterways, ports, drinking and wastewater systems and natural infrastructure along our coasts - touches every sector of our economy and nearly every household
I am hopeful that, despite the damage @POTUS seems determined to inflict, this carefully crafted agreement will ultimately survive and Iran and our allies will remain committed to this deal so the U.S. may re-enter it when more rational heads prevail https://t.co/JUqd0VwO1b
@TomFriedman has described the Trump doctrine as "Obama built it. I broke it. You fix it." It is clear that analysis still holds and that, in the short term, @POTUS is willing to sacrifice our standing in the world for political gain.
@POTUS's dangerous obsession with dismantling President Obama‚Äôs legacy puts our national security at risk. It also puts what could be a historic agreement with a far more volatile country like North Korea even further out of reach
With absolutely no alternative deal in place, @Potus's irresponsible and shortsighted decision ultimately increases the odds of armed conflict with Iran, and could needlessly provoke a dangerous arms race in the region.
Real leaders don't build themselves up by tearing down others. From the TPP to the Paris Agreement and now with the #IranDeal, @POTUS seems to be solely driven by his desire to tear down good policies simply because they are President Obama's achievements.
Pulling out of the #IranDeal - with no replacement in sight - leaves America and our allies less safe and diminishes our credibility as a world leader and an honest partner. I urge @POTUS: don‚Äôt abandon an agreement that is preventing a nuclear armed Iran https://t.co/3Xihgyj65B

Tragically, unaccompanied children in @HHSGov‚Äôs charge continue to be exploited by those who use them as free labor, or worse. In fact HHS has ‚Äòlost‚Äô 1,500 of 7,000 children in this program. After two years of broken promises, HHS and DHS must deliver. https://t.co/vtsiKFQHnc
When children arrive at our borders without a parent or guardian, the law requires @HHSGov to take custody of and care for those children as we would our own. Earlier, @SenRobPortman and I held a hearing to highlight how HHS and @DHSgov are still falling short on that mandate
I always say that when the team does well, a true leader gives credit to the team. When the team falls short, the leader takes the blame.		Today, @EPAScottPruitt failed to show real leadership and refused to accept any responsibility for his series of ethical failures at @EPA. https://t.co/kRKxeKpGlZ
I had hoped to discuss these issues and others with Mr. Pompeo first-hand. Unfortunately, he couldn't make the time to meet with me ahead of today's vote. Though I hope I am wrong, I am not convinced that Mr. Pompeo will suitably represent American values around the world.
Mr. Pompeo has repeatedly sought to undermine the historic agreement that has halted Iran‚Äôs nuclear program. And he has opposed efforts to advance the rights of minorities, including women and LGBT people, and has promoted deeply troubling views regarding Muslim Americans
Now, perhaps more than ever, I believe America‚Äôs top diplomat must be an individual who will reassure our allies around the world of America‚Äôs commitment to democracy, humanitarianism and critical international agreements, including the Iran nuclear deal (JCPOA)

Instead of continuing the progress we‚Äôve made over the past 48 years, this administration has made clear its intent to roll back clean air rules and clean water protections while burying its head in the sand on the greatest environmental challenge of our time, #climatechange
I joined millions of marchers on the first #EarthDay in 1970 as together we fought for major changes in the Clean Air Act and passage of the Clean Water Act. On #EarthDay2018, these bedrock laws are under attack by a reckless @EPA Administrator

Delaware is no stranger to clean water challenges, as the crisis in Blades reminded us. The federal #CleanWaterAct is a vital tool for us to hold upstream polluters accountable. The law has been working for nearly 50 years. We shouldn‚Äôt undermine it now https://t.co/SwNcPSKJG7
Efforts to undermine these federal protections aren‚Äôt hypothetical ‚Äì they have real impacts on Delaware‚Äôs ability to hold polluters accountable if they dirty the waters of the Brandywine Creek, for example, which flows from Pennsylvania and provides water to all of Wilmington https://t.co/fztDe695Au
Yesterday, the EPW Committee held a hearing designed to question rules in the Clean Water Act that have been used by downstream states like Delaware for decades to protect our groundwater from polluters hundreds of miles upstream.

I have believed that Scott Pruitt was unfit to serve as @EPA Administrator since he was nominated. Over the last year, he has been worse than expected - with dangerous policies, ethical failings, wasteful spending and no accountability to the people whom he is supposed to serve.
During his confirmation process, I warned about Mr. Pruitt‚Äôs ‚Äòunacceptably casual approach to meeting obligations as a public servant.‚Äô Unfortunately, that warning fell on deaf ears. Today, I joined 169 of my colleagues in Congress calling on @EPAScottPruitt to resign. https://t.co/eqops7qWP1

For nearly 50 years, the #CleanAirAct has been protecting Delawareans from unaccountable polluters hundreds of miles away. Sadly, President Trump and @EPAScottPruitt are actively working against #cleanair progress, and many of their actions will create more pollution in Delaware

At a time when the @uscensusbureau is without permanent leadership, already projecting record low response rates, and struggling to test for the #2020Census, this is the wrong decision for so many reasons
All levels of our government and the businesses that drive our economy are relying on accurate #2020Census data to plan accordingly and make investment decisions. Adding a controversial question that will likely decrease responses is irresponsible and a waste of taxpayer dollars
Our Constitution, which established the #Census, calls for a counting of all people living in this country -- both citizens and non-citizens. Suddenly adding a citizenship question is entirely unnecessary and goes against the very purpose of the Census
Then-candidate Trump began his campaign by demonizing immigrants. His administration's rhetoric and actions regarding immigrants have only heightened concern. Adding a politically-motivated citizenship question to #2020Census is another piece of @POTUS' anti-immigrant agenda
The Trump Administration‚Äôs decision to add a question about citizenship to the #2020Census is not only deeply troubling and legally questionable, but also threatens to undermine the accuracy of this critical count https://t.co/QTm3ZcjDfY

These statistics tell us one thing: The ACA is working. But we can always make it better. Instead of ripping health care away from more than 20 million Americans, let‚Äôs #protectourcare and work together to make this law work for even more Americans in the next 8 years and beyond.
Just last year, Delawareans saw the beneficial impacts of the ACA: More than 20,000 marketplace enrollees received over $100,000 in premium tax credits for 2017.
8 years ago today, the Affordable Care Act was signed into law. Today, the #ACA has insured over 20 million Americans, including 67,900 Delawareans through Medicaid expansion alone.

Underinvestment in infrastructure isn't just being felt in Blades, Delaware. We all agree that historic infrastructure investments are desperately needed across the country ‚Äì that‚Äôs why candidate Trump‚Äôs call for $1 trillion in infrastructure spending resonated with voters.
The @SenateDems #infrastructure proposal unveiled today provides a roadmap for $1 trillion in real investment in drinking and wastewater systems, roads, highways, bridges, ports and waterways, broadband and other critical priorities. https://t.co/5bzR8DMmw8
Until we get serious about funding modern drinking water systems across the country, small towns and families will continue to bear both the financial and public health burdens of our inaction. https://t.co/4RqMISK0he
Unfortunately, the Trump Administration‚Äôs #infrastructure proposal focuses more on cutting environmental protections ‚Äì like those that address water pollution ‚Äì rather than making the historic investments in our infrastructure we badly need.
In Delaware, we've seen that smart investments can dramatically improve our water quality. But states can't tackle this challenge on their own ‚Äì the federal government has an important role to play, too.
We had a successful outcome in Blades thanks to everyone‚Äôs hard work. However, if we‚Äôre serious about making lasting progress, we must focus on the root causes of these all-too-common drinking water crises, rather than just addressing the symptoms as they arise.
Last month, when water testing in the town of Blades, Delaware showed contamination from PFCs, I was heartened by the all-hands-on-deck effort that came together quickly to provide emergency water supplies and work toward getting the town clean water again.
We can either pretend we‚Äôre going to invest in our country‚Äôs #infrastructure, or we can actually do it. @SenateDems have a $1 trillion infrastructure plan that makes real investments in our country and our workers https://t.co/xPmwfjz8Oq
The water crisis in Blades was just the tip of the iceberg. Decades of underfunding will lead to more frequent water crises unless Congress does its job and makes real investments.

Figuring out how we pay for things is always the hard part. But we weren‚Äôt elected to just tackle the easy things ‚Äì Congress has an opportunity to do something meaningful to address our nation‚Äôs infrastructure needs, and we shouldn‚Äôt squander it.
Frankly, the best way to speed up projects is to provide long-term funding and program certainty. Time and time again, the research has shown that inadequate funding is the most common factor delaying water and transportation projects.
And gutting environmental protections does not achieve time or cost savings for infrastructure projects. Instead, we should implement the new authorities that Congress has already passed in 2012, 2015 and 2016.
We can‚Äôt go from an 80 percent federal share to a 20 percent share and expect states that are already facing budget constraints to pick up the slack.
And it‚Äôs hard to take @POTUS's $200 billion proposal seriously when it‚Äôs paired with a budget that would cut $240 billion from existing #infrastructure programs.

President Trump has the audacity to release his #InfrastructurePlan on the very same day that his #TrumpBudget proposes slashing $240 billion from existing infrastructure programs. Well, the American people aren‚Äôt fooled.
We've seen this movie before. The #GOPTaxBill asked middle class Americans to pay for a giveaway to corporations and billionaires. Now, President Trump's #InfrastructurePlan asks cash-strapped states to cover the cost when it comes to funding infrastructure improvements.
An #InfrastructurePlan that relies on cities and states that already bear the lion's share of funding obligations for infrastructure is a bad deal, especially for rural states.
President Trump can equivocate and talk about leveraging federal dollars, but the math just does not add up. $200 billion is a far cry from the $1 trillion that then-candidate Trump promised, and it's even further from the $1.5 trillion he touted today.
On the campaign trail, then-candidate Trump promised a large scale, trillion dollar infrastructure investment. 		After waiting more than a year for President Trump's #InfrastructurePlan, what the White House released today is unrealistic, inadequate and irresponsible.
As our nation's top environmental official spends an undisclosed amount of taxpayer dollars to jet set around the world, the #TrumpBudget guts @EPA's funding by 34% ‚Äì that's critical funding that would go toward ensuring all Americans have a safe and healthy environment.
After the first reports of @EPAScottPruitt's questionable travel expenses surfaced last year, I asked the @EPAoig to conduct a full audit ‚Äì that investigation now spans all of Administrator Pruitt's travel in 2017.

If the administration insists on proceeding with this proposal, then it should carve out the cherished Delaware coast, and similar areas along the Atlantic, from any efforts to increase drilling. #ProtectOurCoast https://t.co/LOWm8vFKmD
In Florida, @SecretaryZinke clearly established the standard: If an area yields greater economic value from coastal activities and industries, and local communities are solidly opposed, then those areas should get the same exemption as Florida.
It‚Äôs not just Delawareans, or even just Democrats, who acknowledge that increasing drilling off our coasts is the wrong move. Republican governors and lawmakers from states like Georgia and South Carolina have publicly stated their opposition to the Trump Administration‚Äôs plan.
It seems to me that the only real difference between Florida and Delaware (and every other coastal state that wasn't lucky enough to get an exemption from Secretary Zinke) is that @POTUS happens to have beachfront properties in Florida.
You know who also recognizes that coastal communities could be negatively impacted by offshore drilling? Interior @SecretaryZinke. In fact, that was the exact justification that Secretary Zinke used to carve Florida‚Äôs Gulf coast out of the Trump Administration‚Äôs proposal.
Proponents say that offshore drilling brings more economic benefits along the coast‚Äîbut the truth is, our thriving coastal areas receive greater economic benefits from having a healthy and sustainable ocean off their shores.
Delaware's coast generates $6.9 billion each year. Our beach communities, including Rehoboth Beach, support 59,000 jobs and $711 million in tax revenue. Our coasts provide more than 10% of our state's total employment, taxes and business production. https://t.co/OFQ9LIGXXt

To begin tackling #climatechange, we need a CEQ leader who has a deep respect for science, for environmental laws on the books and for those who hold different views than their own. 		It's past time for @POTUS to nominate an environmental and public health champion to lead CEQ.
It was abundantly clear that leading the White House Council on Environmental Quality wasn‚Äôt the right job for Kathleen Hartnett White. I often say when you think you‚Äôre right, when you know you‚Äôre right, you must never give up. That‚Äôs what we did here. https://t.co/lqSrIuI2rs

If President Trump is serious about bringing parties in Congress together, then his words tonight are not enough. We need real actions and leadership tomorrow and in the days ahead. #SOTU
Tonight, President Trump pledged to rebuild our country with a historic $1.5 trillion investment in our infrastructure ‚Äì the same promise he made to the American people in his speech last year ‚Äì but tomorrow we will still be waiting for his long overdue plan to do so. #SOTU
Tonight, President Trump said he was extending an open hand to a bipartisan deal on immigration, but we don't know who we will be negotiating with in the White House tomorrow. #SOTU
Tonight, President Trump talked about expanding the American Dream, but tomorrow he will continue to trumpet a tax bill that's created a windfall of wealth for corporate shareholders, not a boon to wage growth or job creation. #SOTU
Tonight, we heard from our "Tuesday President." But we know now that we can‚Äôt expect a similar performance tomorrow.
Tonight, President Trump stuck to his script and delivered a #SOTU speech with little fanfare. I'm sure some will try to ascribe meaning to both the performance he gave and the promises he made. 		But we should not forget that the exact same thing happened last year.

I've asked @EPW Administrator Scott Pruitt to spare us with the #PruittPlatitudes he so frequently uses, but I'm not holding my breath. Let's see how this goes. #PruittLingoBingo https://t.co/mwfznEurZF
Scott Pruitt likes to say that he's "getting the agency back to basics." His @EPA is actually moving us backward‚Äîall the way back to the 1970s when polluters were able to spew the most dangerous toxins like mercury, lead and arsenic into the air we breathe and the water we drink.
Scott Pruitt often reminds people that he is a former Attorney General, and he "know[s] what it means to prosecute folks." But under his leadership, @EPA has slowed actions against polluters.
It didn't happen by accident, @EPAScottPruitt. https://t.co/G4lG13i1nv
Scott Pruitt likes to tout that the U.S. is "actually at pre-1994 levels with respect to our CO2 footprint thanks to innovation and technology" while ignoring the common sense and bipartisan regulations put in place over the last four decades to get us to those pre-1994 levels.
Scott Pruitt repeatedly insists that he's committed to "cooperative federalism" and the @EPA "needs to work together with the states to achieve better outcomes." Yet, this administration has sought to zero out funding for critical state environmental programs.
Scott Pruitt often says that "process matters." @EPAScottPruitt, do you really think that verbally directing career staff at @EPA to delete the inconvenient economic benefits of the Clean Water Rule is a good rulemaking process?
Scott Pruitt often says the "rule of law matters." Well, Congress was very prescriptive when it wrote the Clean Air Act. But the @EPA has chosen to continuously ignore and delay that very specific mandate from Congress, which leaves vulnerable communities at risk indefinitely.
Doing nothing to #ActOnClimate would be bad enough. But the fact that this administration seems to be actively working to discredit and hide the clear science is the height of irresponsibility https://t.co/rZA8ntYMc9
Instead of spending time and resources trying to tackle what many of us believe is the greatest environmental challenge of our lifetime, under Scott Pruitt‚Äôs leadership the @EPA is choosing to wage a war on climate science

@EPA Bill Wehrum believes there's no justification for EPA to regulate the largest sources of mercury and air toxics pollution‚Äîeven though power companies have already bought, paid for and installed control technology on all power plants without hiking electricity prices.
@EPA Bill Wehrum believes there's no justification for @EPA to regulate the largest sources of mercury and air toxics pollution‚Äîpollution that settles in our lakes and rivers, accumulates in our fish, and makes them too dangerous to eat.
@EPA Bill Wehrum believes there's no justification for @EPA to regulate the largest sources of mercury and air toxic pollution‚Äîpollution that pediatricians tell us damages children's brains and could affect up to 600,000 newborns every year.
@EPA Bill Wehrum has spent most of his career fighting to dismantle the federal environmental protections that so many states, including Delaware, depend¬†on to clean up toxic air pollution.
@EPA Toxic air pollution gets into the air we breathe, gets into the food we eat, builds up in our bodies without our knowledge, and can lead to cancer, mental impairment and even death.
@EPA Much of our country's ongoing efforts to clean up air pollution hinges on making sure that every state plays by the rules and does their fair share to reduce air pollution. That includes dangerous toxic pollution like mercury.
In one of those instances, the courts faulted @EPA's lack of action to reduce mercury and air toxic pollution emissions from electric power plants. https://t.co/J8OsfFJfWy
@EPA The number of times courts have overturned regulations that Bill Wehrum helped to craft at @EPA? 27.		That's 27 times that the courts determined the rules Bill Wehrum put in place didn't follow the law or adequately protect public health.
@EPA Throughout his career, Bill Wehrum has clearly shown that he's dismissive of the science at the core of @EPA's actions to protect public health
Americans deserve @EPA leaders who believe in sound science. Americans need EPA leaders who will listen to our medical experts when it comes to our health.

What we don‚Äôt know is the damage AHCA will have on middle class families and our economy because House GOP plan to vote without a CBO score.
We know that AHCA puts Americans back at the mercy of insurance companies, which will choose who can get covered &amp; what that coverage costs.

I cannot and will not support the nomination of Rep. Price to serve as our next Secretary of HHS
Instead of building bridges and seeking compromise, Rep. Price has sought to tear down the #ACA and put the health care for millions at risk
The cause to which Rep. Price has dedicated himself‚Äîrepealing the ACA without a replacement‚Äîwould devastate peoples‚Äô lives and our economy
My constituents tell me health care costs remain far too high. Rep. Price‚Äôs efforts to #RepealandRun would only increase health care costs
Under #RepealAndRun? Health insurance premiums in the individual market will skyrocket‚Äîincreasing up to 25% immediately and doubling by 2026
Under the GOP's #RepealandRun strategy? The individual market will collapse. 32 million Americans will become uninsured over the next decade
Plain and simple, a #RepealAndRun of the Affordable Care Act would unfurl chaos across the health care sector and across our economy
High-risk pools were a failed solution before the #ACA: coverage was expensive and inadequate, and only 5% of those eligible enrolled
In the House, Rep. Price led efforts to repeal the Affordable Care Act and doubled down on high deductible plans and high risk pools
