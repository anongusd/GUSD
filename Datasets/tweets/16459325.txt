@rachsieg ok but this might explain why he's not done with the LBJ books
In summary, the FBI broke with its standard practice on investigations, tilting the election to a candidate who then may have used that as a pretext to interfere with an investigation into him, and now could use it to stop the results of that investigation from becoming public.
But now some fear that the DOJ will use the "derogatory information" standard to withhold the most damning parts of the report from Congress and the public.
The president cannot be indicted, under DOJ guidelines, and there may not be evidence that he did anything wrong in a report filed by the special counsel.
The firing of Comey misfires, however, and the deputy attorney general ends up appointing a special counsel to look into the Russia stuff.
After winning the election, Trump fired Comey, over the Russia investigations, as he later admitted, using a letter from the deputy attorney general giving the stated reason that Comey had gone against the rule on derogatory information.
Some people make the case that the Comey letter was a major reason why Trump won the election, in which Clinton had been favored.
Because he had done that, he felt obligated to notify Congress when new evidence was found, which turned out to be inconsequential.
FBI Director James Comey went against that practice when he decided to speak out publicly about the reasoning behind their decisions on the Hillary Clinton email scandal.
The FBI's general practice is not to release derogatory information about people who it ends up deciding not to charge with a crime.
Step back for a moment and consider the multiple layers of irony here:

I don't want to compare any campaign to "Bohemian Rhapsody" because it would be too mean.
Kirsten Gillibrand is "BlacKkKlansman." A new offering from someone who's been around for a while and whose style and tone has shifted over the years.
Beto O'Rourke is "A Star Is Born." Fans love it, though critics poked some holes in the storyline. It's a classic narrative of an up-and-comer. Will voters buy it?
Elizabeth Warren is "The Favourite." Meaty and substantive, it ticks a lot of boxes in theory but might also be too much of a change.
("Vice" would have been the obvious joke here for Biden.)
Joe Biden is "Green Book." At one point, this would have been a clear frontrunner, since it's so made to order. But it's held back by some misfires.
Bernie Sanders is "Black Panther." It made a lot of money, which can't be discounted, but history says in the end voters won't go for it.

@jessicashortall I hope that if my mind goes eventually I can still fight my way to the surface to throw decades-old shade like that.
@jessicashortall I was interviewing him. My grandma, who was in the middle stages of Alzheimer's, was nearby, in kind of a fog. He started getting weepy about his dear mother. Suddenly, grandma perks up, says "Oh she wasn't all that" and then settles back into the fog.
He died just a few months after turning 100. Here is the Stetson hat and some bolo ties that he always wore in retirement, since he didn't feel dressed without a tie of some sort. https://t.co/s3re3yBCYR
He was born on Sept. 13 and met my grandmother on the 13th, so whenever he made a business deal he always included a 13 somewhere in the offer.
He also witnessed the liberation of a concentration camp from across a hill (I don't know which one), but he wasn't close enough to realize how bad it was until after the war when the photos came out.
But he said he didn't want to be a "shirk," and ended up leaving the church. It's clear that he didn't really want to kill either, and he never was put in that situation. At one point, he carried a bazooka, but he never got close enough to a German tank to fire it.
As a member of the Church of the Brethren, one of the major pacifist denominations, he could have avoided service. His parents even brought him the forms to declare himself a conscientious objector.
One day one of the Germans comes up to him and says "Herr Beckwith, I speak English now." Then he rattled off every filthy curse word he'd heard a GI ever use, followed by "OK, let's go!" Everyone laughed.
He spoke a little German and knew how to type, so he ended up helping draw up maps and running errands for officers instead of being shot at. Part of his job was to talk with the three German civilians who helped.
A lifelong teetotaler, he asked for liquor and cigarette rations when he was in the military. He'd stuff them in his duffel bag and then sell them when they had a layover someplace like Morocco.
A 15-cent profit margin! Not bad. Grandpa was always a horse trader like that. His plans to be a doctor were sidetracked by World War II and he ended up becoming an ag teacher at the high school.
He would then take the gophers to his father, who paid him 10 cents for each one. And then he'd cut off the feet and take those to the county, which paid another 10 cents. Then he'd give Marjorie five cents.
My grandfather grew up in Iowa. Gophers were a problem on the farm, so his father showed him how to catch them. But he didn't like getting his hands dirty, so he got his sister, Marjorie, to set up the traps.

This is incredibly damaging at a time when viewers need to be reassured more than ever that we take this job seriously. But if these people can do the job, then let's see them prove it.
It's not like these very people weren't often decrying the news media as biased when it just happened to tell facts that were uncomfortable for their side to acknowledge.
It's not like there aren't, you know, hundreds of recently laid off journalists with the right skill sets and experience to do that job.
But sure, hire someone who actively managed a presidential campaign to work for your cable news network. Hire the former president's daughter as a commentator. Hire people who worked in the White House.
When the nice young kids near the Metro stop ask if I can sign a petition, I say no and solemnly explain that I am a journalist. I've never given a campaign donation or volunteered for a campaign.
I regularly change my party registration. I don't vote in races that I've personally covered. I work hard to give all sides of a debate the benefit of the doubt, even when they are sometimes clearly arguing in bad faith.
But reporters worry about this stuff. About conflicts of interest or perceptions of a conflict of interest. About ethics. About appearing fair and unbiased.
In retrospect, that was silly. It would have been nice to have my dad come to town in a time in my life in which I was very isolated and lonely.
The reason: I was worried that readers would think he'd only gotten the job because of connections to me or that my coverage was unfair because of it.
When I was a city reporter in the Pacific Northwest, my dad thought about applying for a planning contract near my work. I asked him not to.

Wash your hands. Stay home when you are sick. Make sure your vaccines are up to date. And for G-d’s sake, vaccinate your children.
He relied on what we call "herd immunity" — if most people were vaccinated, then the worst viruses couldn't get a foothold, and he'd never be exposed. But that meant the rest of us needed to do our part.
His immune system was compromised. Even a minor infection from the outside world could turn into a serious medical setback, perhaps even life-threatening.
My cousin had leukemia. As a teenager, I would visit him in the cancer ward at Fred Hutchinson in Seattle. All of us would wash our hands thoroughly before we went in. I was afraid to scratch my nose for fear I'd bring in a germ.
That's the science. Now let's talk on an emotional level.
The CDC recommends routine childhood immunization for MMR at 12 through 15 months of age, with a second dose at 4 through 6 years of age. https://t.co/eXebGlcT7o
"The virus is transmitted by direct contact with infectious droplets or by airborne spread when an infected person breathes, coughs, or sneezes. Measles virus can remain infectious in the air for up to two hours after an infected person leaves an area." https://t.co/eXebGlcT7o
"Measles is one of the most contagious of all infectious diseases; approximately 9 out of 10 susceptible persons with close contact to a measles patient will develop measles." https://t.co/eXebGkVhIO
People at highest risk for measles: 		• Infants and children aged &lt;5 years	• Adults aged &gt;20 years	• Pregnant women	• People with compromised immune systems, such as from leukemia and HIV infection		https://t.co/eXebGlcT7o
"Since 2000, when measles was declared eliminated from the U.S., the annual number of cases has ranged from a low of 37 in 2004 to a high of 667 in 2014. The majority of cases have been among people who are not vaccinated against measles." https://t.co/eXebGlcT7o
"Subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE) is a very rare, but fatal disease of the central nervous system that results from a measles virus infection acquired earlier in life." https://t.co/WFD2CeXAie
"Measles may cause pregnant women to give birth prematurely, or have a low-birth-weight baby." https://t.co/WFD2CeXAie
"For every 1,000 children who get measles, one or two will die from it." https://t.co/WFD2CeXAie
"About one child out of every 1,000 who get measles will develop encephalitis (swelling of the brain) that can lead to convulsions and can leave the child deaf or with intellectual disability." https://t.co/WFD2CeXAie
"As many as one out of every 20 children with measles gets pneumonia, the most common cause of death from measles in young children." https://t.co/WFD2CeXAie
"Ear infections occur in about one out of every 10 children with measles and can result in permanent hearing loss." https://t.co/WFD2CeXAie

In the decade before a measles vaccine was available, 3 to 4 million people were infected each year. An estimated 400 to 500 died, 48,000 were hospitalized and 1,000 suffered encephalitis, according to the CDC. https://t.co/QBQn5KwAGF https://t.co/BHmi0exXbA

Here’s Who Will Attend the State of the Union Address as Guests of the White House and Members of Congress https://t.co/BO1xkvGbVW
SOURCES: https://t.co/IA4erroLV9
• Campaign finance violations aren't a crime, but even if they were, it was Michael Cohen's fault.
• The president never committed obstruction of justice, but anyway, it's not possible for the president to obstruct justice.
• The Trump campaign never colluded with the Russians, but anyway, collusion is not a crime.
• Trump never made any business deals with Russia while running for president, but if he did, there would be nothing wrong with that.
• Trump didn't fire Comey because of the Russia investigation, but if he did, there would be nothing wrong with that.
• The Russians didn't provide any dirt on Hillary Clinton at the Trump Tower meeting, but if they did, there would be nothing wrong with that.
Lawyers call it "arguing in the alternative," and they do it all the time. The two claims are contradictory — "My client didn't do it, but if he did, it was totally justified." — but it allows you to get past the jury.
"The food here is terrible, and the portions are too small."
The Borscht Belt joke that explains Trump's Mueller defense:

Paul Manafort: "I've always known him to be a good man ... a very decent man."
Michael Flynn: "Mike Flynn is a fine person."
Donald Trump Jr.: "My son is a wonderful young man."
Trump praises the people around him who are caught up in the Mueller investigation. See if you can spot the one that's different.

@GrahamDavidA I think what you are doing is called "mansplaining." It's a thing where men over explain things to other people. It's a portmanteau from "man" and "explain." A portmanteau is a word that combines two other words to form a new whole. It originated with Lewis Caroll in his book Ali

Also, this is a super weak crutch in a debate. There are lots of good arguments to be made about these ideas, but trying to define them as out of bounds is cheap, doesn't work and leaves your defenses down.
Also, who are these expensive advisors? They should have flagged this for him the first time he did it and cut this off before it became a habit. Now he's done it three times.
I think this is just rookie candidate stuff, the kind of language you throw around with your friends that plays much differently once you become a candidate. But it highlights how much he has to learn if he wants to do this right.
Plus, all the things he's mentioned are within the bounds of current debate. America has had higher taxation rates before, lots of mainstream candidates are debating health care and everyone has opinions on spoiler candidates.
More importantly, READ THE ROOM. Voters who are disaffected from Trump often cite his attacks on political and democratic norms. Calling things "un-American" is on that same spectrum.
To be fair, candidates from both parties throw around "un-American," but it's usually reserved for the occasional reference. This is three times in a single week. That's overkill.

@mkarolian the reverse "The Martian"
I can tell you what a few other government agencies would have said to that.
"But what if I gave you all the money you could ever need to do it? Trump asked. "What if we sent NASA"s budget through the roof, but focused entirely on that instead of whatever else you're doing now. Could it work then?"
Per "Team of Vipers," pp. 86-87.
Acting NASA Administrator Robert Lightfoot Jr. may be the last honest man in Washington. Trump literally says he'd send the agency's budget "through the roof" if they could get a man to Mars by the end of his first term, and he replies that it's not technically possible.
"This job is a lot harder than I though it'd be." — Donald Trump, in week two of his presidency, per "Team of Vipers" (p. 71)

Even still, Democrats were willing to give him this, in exchange for something meaningful. They would have given him 5x as much money for a path to citizenship for 1.8 million Dreamers.
And not just that he built the wall, but that he did it when they said it couldn't be done, that he snookered the Democrats, that he was the master negotiator.
When Trump asks for $5 billion for the wall, then, he's also asking for a tag line he can use for re-election, a day, if not more, of messaging at the RNC convention and endless bumper stickers and T-shirts: "He Built the Wall."
He's already made that claim in rallies, despite the fact that he hasn't.
No one in their right mind thinks that Trump would follow through on that. The minute the deal was signed, he'd be out in some red state arena talking about how he built the Wall.
To me, the moment that explains the shutdown impasse was when Trump said you could call the wall "peaches." I'm not kidding.

@MEPFuller @TalKopan All politicians also believe that their positions are best for the country and that they are uniquely suited to making them happen, so it's rational for him to want to continue to be president for the best of the country.
@MEPFuller @TalKopan You can argue that he's making the wrong calculation. I'm just saying it's not irrational. He's never going to win Dem./Ind. support at this point, so if he loses his base, he'll crater.
@MEPFuller @TalKopan Very few players in any kind of negotiation truly act irrationally.
@MEPFuller @TalKopan Trump is acting rationally, if you consider that he's only looking at GOP support. He's wagering that he'd lose more support among his base by not getting a wall than holding out in this fight. Until the shutdown costs him significant GOP support...

Finally, ask what they would be willing to do to achieve their goals. An ambitious climate change deal might only be possible through budget reconciliation or nuking the filibuster. Would they support that?
Again, if they don't specify, then assume they probably won't be going for whatever your pet topic is, especially if it's more politically complicated, costly or ambitious.
The next question is priorities. There's simply no way the next Democratic president will be able to achieve all of the goals that they'll be outlining. So which one comes first? Which do they spend their capital on?
Generally, the less detail they give about a proposal, the more you should assume they'll pursue a minimalist version of the policy, once the general election is underway.
The first question to ask is how they define these. One candidate might define Medicare for All as a Canadian-style single payer. Another might define it as a public option for 55+ Americans to buy into if they want.
They will probably even agree, in principle, to some big picture ideas, like Medicare for All. There may be a split among more pragmatic candidates and more idealistic ones on some issues.
Except for a few outliers, most of the candidates are going to broadly agree on the issues, especially vis a vis Trump: immigration, health care, climate change, etc.
The Democratic primary field will be crowded. If you're trying to understand it, keep a few things in mind:

"I'm going to surround myself only with the best and most serious people. We want top of the line professionals.” — Trump, 2015
This is a pretty good way to reassure Trump voters about dysfunction in the White House, though it's undercut by his own statements and his reality TV image as a decisive leader who fires low performers.
To be clear, I haven't read either yet. But the excerpts of Christie's book in Axios and the title of Sims book ("Team of Vipers") seem indicative.

She has much more in common with Sanders, who has a similar diagnosis of the problems, a similar crusading style and a similar self- made political brand.
The assumption seems to be that we should compare her to Clinton, because gender, but they are very different kinds of candidates.
If we are comparing Elizabeth Warren to 2016 candidates, shouldn’t we compare her to Sanders?

There are students who have surprised me by doing well, overcoming the problems they revealed in my class and quickly succeeding.

Because my day job is in the industry where I teach students, and they're graduate-level, I have a fairly good sense of where they are a few years later.
More teachers should keep track of how their students turn out.

Or you could have a narrative that stressed the role that chance plays, like that not-great movie "Sliding Doors," where Gwyneth Paltrow's life is greatly changed by missing a single train.
The ST:TNG episode "Tapestry" got at this notion by having Picard revisit a mistake in his youth, realizing that when he replayed the ending, his life was actually worse for not having made it.
Bandersnatch could have done this by making a clear tradeoff: You can have an ending where the videogame achieves greatness but at a terrible price, or an ending where he fails but lives through it.
‘Rent Doesn’t Get Furloughed.’ Federal Workers Are Missing Their First Paychecks As the Shutdown Drags On https://t.co/FnPGMuansn
The tradeoff, then, is the meaning. The point of the narrative is that you can't have it all and your choices show your values.
For example, there was a videogame once where at the end, you could either save your girlfriend or stop the poison from going into the city's water supply. You couldn't do both.
The solution, I think, is to make the different endings relate to each other.
In a multiple-choice narrative, then, the problem is that the different endings can make it feel pointless.
The ending is what gives the work meaning. If Ilsa and Rick run off together, everything that came before means something different.
I wrote about Choose Your Own Adventures a few years ago and have thought about the problem of the ending for a while.

"I don’t believe shutting down the government is the best course of action," said Sen. Cory Gardner (R-Colo.-2020).
Another reason why I've often thought it would be more helpful to list the year they next face re-election next to a senator's name.
Among those who have already expressed skepticism: Gardner, Collins and Lisa Murkowski.
If you're curious which Republicans might bail on the shutdown strategy first, this is a good list to start with.

@JerylBier But honestly, the best method is to listen to the book on tape. It is a much more oral book than a written one.
@JerylBier I was unemployed. I had a method: Read a chapter, read the synopsis in the Bloomsday book, re-read it with Giffords annotations, read the related part of The Odyssey, then re-read it again clean.
