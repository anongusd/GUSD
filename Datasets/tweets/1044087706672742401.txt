This is what I call a minimum dignified income. I am sure that there is more to dignity than income. But without a minimum dignified income, there is no dignity.‚Äù		Commenter: Fred Meyer	Talk: Roy Bahat	What is the meaning of work?
My view is that dignity has a minimum condition: a person must have enough income to pay for necessities (housing, nutrition, education, transportation, healthcare, childcare and taxes) plus a little extra to pay for some desires. To me that means a minimum livable wage plus 25%.
