@Uber_Support Customer service has already taken care of it (thanks for being speedy on that end), but I‚Äôm done with the service for now.
First experience tonight where an @Uber driver started a fare, never picked me up, and refused to cancel. When I called him twice to ask him to cancel the fare, he refused and then told me he did. Done with @Uber_DC for a while. The service has been terrible lately.
@Uber, we have a problem.
