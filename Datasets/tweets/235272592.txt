@Cydreams13 @916select Shoe circuit or non-shoe circuit agendas are one thing. What a player's agenda should be is another
@PointForwardPro Len Elmore makes great points but when you live in a selfish "Selfie" society that celebrates individual achievement &amp; entitlement ONLY (and not community) like most of these young players do, the chance of Len's wise words penetrating young ears are slim to none
@Cydreams13 @916select Shoe circuits do a great job with their platforms but they provide the biggest benefit to ALL their players when they focus on player development not just talent collecting.
@Cydreams13 @916select That's true but there is a reason why guys like Steph Curry, Kawhi Leonard, 	Damon Lilliard, CJ McCollum and even Kobe (in HS) developed, they were on the floor the whole game and focal points of their teams. Russ Westbrook wasn't on a top team in HS. Didn't hurt his NBA future
@Cydreams13 @916select Key word is "play." There's no benefit of getting better when your not on the court or getting limited minutes or when your not getting shots or not playing your natural long-term position. It's the situation your in, not the circuit that maximizes your development

@teamcervantes1 @realmichaelclay I think you are assuming that all HS coaches don't incorporate skill development into their regiment
@teamcervantes1 @realmichaelclay I am sure that a HS player has access to the HS gym and can come in before practice or stay late getting additional shots up. It seems like your advocating for a 3rd party to get involved as well
@teamcervantes1 @realmichaelclay Time management or not, the HS regular season should be the focus and all basket efforts including skill development should happen within the context of the HS team setting. Plenty of time for other skill development during off season. Key is not just to work hard but also smart

@rayfordyoung @TheTraeYoung Yes this is a personal decision for all these players. Bottom line is that Zion's decision about his future is his.  But the greater dialogue should be centered around what type of future men &amp; leaders are we grooming if ALL they think about is themselves &amp; not their community
@rayfordyoung @TheTraeYoung Ray: there are many others that left school early and are in the same boat as the players you generically mentioned. The Pro Game is a tricky thing. Especially when a large degree of your future fortune depends on the opinions of others making executive decisions
@rayfordyoung @TheTraeYoung I never doubted Trae both on and off the court. My point is when these, young talented athletes make basketball decisions, are they ONLY thinking about the financial aspects of playing? Or are there other elements involved? They have the right to decide what elements are in play

@LancePayton @KingJosiah54 At Roman Catholic basketball goes who has the authority to set the rules for your program? Your school &amp; your head coach/coaching staff?  Or your parents?  Fans in the stands?  Can a parent veto any rule coming from your staff?
@LancePayton @KingJosiah54 As far as the HS coach example: I was once denied the opportunity to be a HS coach because I did not have a teaching credential (even  though I had 2 college degrees). There is a legal case in CA that mandates hiring public credentialed coaches over those that did not have them
@LancePayton @KingJosiah54 What D1 college allow a college coach to be coach without a college degree?  If that requirement is unlawful or unconstitutional, why has nobody brought suit?
@LancePayton @KingJosiah54 Unfortunately athletes (black, white or others) are not a "suspect" class under our constitutional law.  The 19 year old NBA requirement applies to ALL players.  There is no constitutional right for 18 year olds to be millionaires
@LancePayton @KingJosiah54 Why does a college require a degree for a college coach or some high schools require teaching credentials to be a HS coach?  Requirements are a part of life and private businesses like the NBA and NFL are allowed to set their own requirements.
@LancePayton @KingJosiah54 You can require a janitor or janitor supervisor to have a certain number of years experience.  You can require persons who have completed formal college training in  law, medicine, pharmacy, accounting and real estate pass additional tests
@LancePayton @KingJosiah54 Those decisions are made by private businesses that make their own requirements. There are business that require otherwise qualified job applicants to have a degree or possess certain amount of years experience in order to be qualified for the job.
@KillaKam1947 @KingJosiah54 There needs to be better balance between NCAA team activities and academic responsibilities but to act like your football roommate did not get ANY benefit from playing on that UCLA football team is not true. Thousands of student on campus would love free tuition, housing &amp; food.
@KingJosiah54 .....are we going to deduct the amount of $$$ top players get from alumni, boosters &amp; pro agents/runners from their college salaries?  lol
@KingJosiah54 What's the average attendance at Pac12 and UCLA this year?  Its lousy!  How are we going to determine college "market value"? Should it be the same amount for each player on same team? Same amount for a Baron Davis &amp; Josiah Johnson? Same amount team by team?
@StayCareFree @KingJosiah54 Coach that is a NBA issue. Not a college issue.  The NBA put that 1-and-done rule because they felt very young players were not mature enough for the league &amp; lots of frauds got picked in past NBA 1st rounds based on HS hype
@KingJosiah54 How about they get paid for their services and then pay for school and their books like everybody else on campus?  Fair deal?   lol
@KingJosiah54 Josiah: There are lots of reasons to be upset about how the NCAA and its schools operates. But you act like athletes that are good enough to be pros don't have a choice. Nobody forcing them to go to college. They can kill a year being paid overseas while they wait for the draft

@Hsquad99 @john_stovall The potential best "mano y mano" competition is at camps like the NBPA Camp &amp; Pangos. I told @john_stovall that ESPN needs to sponsor a "Euro-Cup" type umbrella platform for top teams from all 3 circuits as well as top indies with John as the commissioner &amp; evaluator-in-chief !
@Hsquad99 @john_stovall Rick when you have 90% of top HS talent divided into 3 parts, that doesn't look like the "United States of America." It looks like the "Balkans"
@john_stovall I fully agree but that should not only happen on a travel shoe weekends.	It should also take place at spots like NBPA Camp, USA Basketball, Nike Skills Academy, SC30 Camp, adidas All-American Camp and @PangosAACamp  We might all wear different shoes but the dream is the same
@john_stovall Third, "Top" competition really exists ONLY when ALL top players are afforded the opportunity to interact &amp; when there are no artificial barriers to them doing so. Nothing wrong with shoe circuit competition but the shoe companies should also allow more interaction between ALL
@john_stovall ...Secondly, three of current Top 25 in 2020 (Ziaire Williams, Daishen Nix &amp; Xavier Foster) achieved their current 5-star status &amp; recruiting value NOT playing on shoe circuit teams. Those players were not deprived in any way in terms of their development &amp; recruiting value.
@john_stovall John: Nike, adidas &amp; UA do a great job with their circuits &amp; I'm right with you with need to play top competition but its also true that if you are getting limited or no min on a shoe circuit team, there is not much benefit accruing. Iron sharpens iron only when they touch

@MrMojays Most white persons in America would agree that we have tons of racial problems. Unfortunately too many (although I believe a minority of them) are set in their racist ways.  Question is how do we build on MLK's &amp; Obama's progress. Inclusion not further polarization is the key
@407strong @RonMFlores @ZerlinaMaxwell That may be true in many cases but not in ALL cases.  That's why Prison Reform is making great progress in this country and needs to be further pursued. My point is that stereo-typing" has led to many problems.  More stereo-typing won't solve them
@407strong @RonMFlores @ZerlinaMaxwell I think you are making my point.  Race is a BIG problem but plenty of other factors out there that affect not just how White people behave but how ALL of us behave
@Calsparks1 Elbert thanks for your input. My point that economics often (not always) plays a bigger role in somebody's standard of living than race.  That doesn't mean that race is not often used by many (not all) as a factor on how they behave
@407strong @RonMFlores @ZerlinaMaxwell Nobody intelligent is denying that racial injustice exists but stereo-typing does not reflect the whole story nor does it lead us to a better place. Plenty of white people in prison that lacked money for good lawyers.  OJ Simpson walked free because he had the best legal help
@MGRADS @AndrewMHatch @RonMFlores @ZerlinaMaxwell Open &amp; honest dialogue &amp; discussion is always good. Leads to  potential solutions we all want. We have all seen how the stereotyping of certain elements of our society has stained our country. Continued stereotyping won't solve our current problems either.
@407strong @RonMFlores @ZerlinaMaxwell Zimmerman deserves to be locked up but to stereo-type every "White" person as being of the same mentality and beliefs is only NOT right, it's not productive to achieving the type of country that all fair-minded, good Americans want
@all_metelite Thanks for making my point!
@MrMojays Any intelligent person would conclude that we have more than 1 problem but again the question is how do we All get to a destination that we can all be happy with and proud of. Appreciate the honest and open dialogue
@MrMojays But you are assuming that ALL white people have the same thoughts and assumptions about Black people &amp; other minorities. That is not only not 100% true, it's a dangerous position that is polarizing &amp; not productive to all of us living in a society we all deserve.
@MrMojays That assumes that All Whites &amp; All Blacks are the same. Many of both races are mixed with other ethnicities &amp; races. We have made much progress over last   50 years but the question now is how do we continue to move forward. Inclusiveness not continued polarization is the key
@MrMojays Coach we do have serious &amp; complex racial problems &amp; issues in America but to claim that ALL whites have a "privilege" is not conducive to finding the common ground we need to move forward. Continuing to focus only on race just results in more polarization not the unity we need

@FrankieBur ..........additionally not all bleacher rows were pulled out. Compared to past #1 vs #2 it was the worst attendance in CA history. Dominguez vs. Westchester drew 7,000 (1997) &amp; 8500 (1998). Bishop Montgomery vs. Chino Hills sold-out Cerritos College (3500) with 500 outside
@FrankieBur As a person who has been doing events for 25 years, I've learned a lot about perceived attendance &amp; actual attendance.  Saw the game on TV &amp; KDOC had multiple camera angles showing both bleacher areas.  Plenty of open seats on both sides (including entire rows).
@FrankieBur @rchshoops @Compton_Magic @Cydreams13 @RonMFlores @latsondheimer @JoelFranHoops @Devin_Ugland @FullTimeHoops1 @LukeTurner1313 @DominickHarri2 Great win by Rancho Christian last night.  RC got good production from Dominick Harris &amp; Luke Turner.  Sierra Canyon is going to have to find a way to get Cassius Stanley more involved offensively next time as well as utilize L Simpson on defensive end (especially on Harris)
@SoCalJCred @burrellee3 @pollonpreps @RonMFlores @FrankieBur @latsondheimer Now you wonder why CIF-SS play-off attendance is way down last few years and a California #1 vs #2 match-up only drew 1,500 last night
@burrellee3 @pollonpreps @RonMFlores @FrankieBur @latsondheimer a 4th place team in the Trinity League is probably the #1 team in 90% of the other leagues in SoCal.
@FrankieBur An 8 team "open" division belong in Idaho, Montana and North Dakota, not in a SoCal area that has about 20 million people.  Any play-off division less than 16 teams in a region as big as the area CIF-SS encompasses is an indictment on the quality of our HS hoops
@FrankieBur Then that's a reflection of what is wrong with CIF-SS basketball right now. #DuckSeason
@burrellee3 @pollonpreps @RonMFlores @FrankieBur @latsondheimer They also beat Bishop Gorman (NV #1).  I am not advocating that SJB gets bumped from the Open. If you read what I said, there needs to be a play-in game for #8 seed
@FrankieBur That's not the question.    Strength of schedule must mean something.  Can't reward those that duck competition and penalize those that take on all comers. If the NCAA tourney rewards SOS, why not the CIF Open Committee?
@burrellee3 @pollonpreps @RonMFlores @FrankieBur @latsondheimer What was Bosco's strength of schedule this year?

@JCCoach32 Whose 15 years? Yours? Doing grassroots hoops for 25+ years. Can't identify you out of a police line-up. There's a difference between being the head of a program and just a team flunky
@JCCoach32 No need for a "Salute Police" if adults wouldn't act like kids lol As far as being concerned with others'  programs. What I am concerned with is adults lying to players/parents to get them on any AAU team. When that happens, I won't hesitate to call it out.
@JCCoach32 Nothing wrong with anybody being proud of the AAU program they are associated with but this "saluting" shit is childish. Means nothing.

This is time of yr that lots of AAU "Saluting" going on.  Come April there's going to be lots of "U-turning" lol  Players/parents beware of the "fast-talking" going on. Do your home-work.  Find best situation that maximizes your recruiting value.  Got to be on floor to have value

Speaking of the @PangosAACamp there are 4 camp alums in this @rchshoops and McEachern game: Isaiah &amp; Evan Mobley, Sharife Cooper and Isaac Okoro
If ESPN's Paul Biancardi would get out more often, he would realize that @rchshoops ' Isaiah Mobley didn't just transform into a MCDees AA guy at the 2018 NBPA Camp. He played very well all last season with his HS team, @Compton_Magic &amp; was MVP of the @PangosAACamp Top 30 Game.
@BIReports Waiting to see if any kid interviewed today at Hoop Hall is asked the following question:  How does it feel to play on the big stage today on MLK Day ?
@Dubs650 @RonMFlores @FrankieBur @BIReports @wceua @RyanSilver1 Scottie killing ain't nothing new. Here is Exhibit A from his freshman year at the Pangos All-East Fr/So Camp: https://t.co/8KsewyOPp8
@Dubs650 @RonMFlores @FrankieBur @BIReports What's different is his level of competitiveness. I coached him in @wceua Elite 100 Camp Top All-Star Game last July and was the main reason I handed @RyanSilver1 (who had Nico Mannion &amp; Bryan Antoine) a "L" in that game.  Plays to win whether it is hoops or horseshoes!
What is important to reflect on during this MLK holiday is that Martin Luther King Jr. was more than just a great African-American. He was more than just a great American. He was a great world leader whose moral values have inspired generations across the globe!

@MSECollegiate @NCAA Coach Love: you are a great example of why we have a mental health crisis in America right now!  Please get help !
@MSECollegiate Kenny Rogers once sang the following words "You gotta know when to hold 'em, know when to fold ' em." Time  for you to "fold 'em" when it comes to talking about college coaches recruiting middle school kids! Please!
@MSECollegiate @NCAA My tweets have nothing to do with middle school players. The emphasis on the middle school level should be on learning the game &amp; developing skills for future success not recruiting exposure
Additionally as far as @NCAA HS recruiting calendar goes....any current or future system that continues to treat elite prospects (Top 1%) with preferential treatment over non-elite prospects is a fundamentally unfair system for non-elite HS prospects as well as non-elite colleges
Seeing all kinds of HS  recruiting calendar proposals in response to recent ill-advised @NCAA changes. Any solution that doesn't once &amp; for all dismantle this "1 size fits all" approach will continue to be a failed system. Fairness to ALL 325+ D1 schools must be guiding principle
@EvanDaniels What value do @usabasketball and NBPA Top 100 Camp have for @NCAA Mid-major &amp; below D1 schools? This "1 size fits all" recruiting model is not fair to all D1 schools. When will the NABC stand up and represent all its D1 coaches in this matter? @MikeFlynn826

@GLITTERROAD @NCAA Not sure. You might want to DM Adam Silver lol
The @NCAA just sent event operators a notice of their intention to impose more stringent financial disclosure requirements on us. I will make the NCAA a deal: you show us your books, I will be more than happy to show you mine! Enough of the hypocrisy!
@LEGION4IAMANY @EasterwoodKeith Not far off but I have to admit Condeleeza is much classier and less bombastic than Trump lol
Loyalty is often a complicated thing. But the key is NOT having carte blanche loyalty but loyalty only for the RIGHT reasons.
The @NCAA is really trying to choke off elements of the HS hoop scene they don't like or can't fully control &amp; they have enlisted co-conspirators like NBA &amp; USA Basketball to help them do it. But guess what folks: the grassroots terrain is like a roaring rapid. They can't stop it
In basketball as in life....if it ain't broke don't fix it !
Common sense dictates that when you need legal help you hire a lawyer. When you have health issues you go see a doctor. When you have a plumbing problem you hire a plumber. When the NCAA had a recruiting process scandal they hired Condeleeza Rice.  Tells you all you need to know

@ToddTack21 OK Fine then lets send back ALL "illegals" including those that overstayed their VISAs like Melania Trump?  You OK with that?
@UKBIGBLUENATION As far as gated communities go, entry is not typically based on your race, ethnicity or religion. It's based on your bank account.  Plenty of non-whites with $$$ living in the hills of Calabasas.  Much different analogy than a use-less, wasteful border Wall.
@UKBIGBLUENATION Not just the perception it creates which is a MORAL issue. But there are other more technologically-superior and cost-effective ways to achieve border security than a "Wall" whose definition is changing by the minute. The "Wall" is a negative symbol for Trump &amp; his supporters

@805Bball @Tarek_Fattal @scanyonbball .....and for the RECORD...the 1st HS game in California broadcast on national TV by a ESPN network (ESPN2) was Mater Dei (a CIF member school) vs. St. Vincent/St. Mary &amp; LeBron James at the 2003 Pangos Dream Classic in front of 12,500+ fans https://t.co/Yj9PLXZEXn
@805Bball @Tarek_Fattal @scanyonbball The choice for HS teams to be OR not to be on TV is not yours to make. Its based on economics and interest. More public exposure to HS sports is a good thing that can help create future scholarship opportunities to our athletes
@prep_watch @805Bball @Tarek_Fattal @scanyonbball Because they have bamboozled their CIF members to give up their REGULAR season TV rights in order to strike EXCLUSIVE TV deals with the likes of Fox Sports &amp; Time Warner Cable with NO revenue resulting from these game flowing back to member schools. Simple Money Grab!
@805Bball @Tarek_Fattal @scanyonbball Every CIF High School should have their own rights to REGULAR SEASON games being held at their respective high schools.  The fact that they don't, shows the extent of the CIF money grab at the expense of their own member schools
@805Bball @Tarek_Fattal @scanyonbball Got nothing to do about being cranky but don't distort the truth or mislead the public about facts.  ESPN has televised games before in SoCal &amp; the reason more haven't been is that CIF is the barrier to more of these games involving more of our teams being televised
@Tarek_Fattal That's fine but its not what you originally reported
@Tarek_Fattal Mater Dei is a CIF-SS school and for the record they were on live national TV in 2003 on ESPN2 vs LeBron James in front of 12,500 at Pauley Pavilion. To omit mentioning that fact is blatant Valley hyperbole
@Tarek_Fattal Additionally the reason ESPN hasn't televised any games between CIF member schools since then has more to do with CIF taking away regular season TV rights from high schools than the lack of talented SoCal teams &amp; players since 2003 that ESPN would like to put on TV
@Tarek_Fattal That's not what your story implies. The 2003 Pangos Dream Classic was officially hosted by Mayfair that year &amp; the event was approved in accordance with all CIF-section, CIF-State &amp; NFHS regulations.
@Tarek_Fattal @scanyonbball @MayfairHoops That's not true Tarek. Mater Dei vs. St. Vincent/St/Mary at the 2003 Pangos Dream Classic at UCLA's Pauley Pavilion was the 1st game televised live nationally (ESPN2) from a California location involving a CIF school (Mater Dei). Bill Walton &amp; Jay Bilas were on the call that game

And the 1st time this season we have a real  Jordan Brown sighting! The freshman PF has given Nevada a great lift and sparked a Wolf Pack rally to give them a 27-22 lead over Grand Canyon with 4 min left in 1st half. Nevada was down 11-0 to start game
In 1 of the most competitive college games I've seen in awhile, 6-6 240 Tennessee senior Admiral Scholfield had 30 pts (25 in 2nd half) to beat #1 Gonzaga. Strong &amp; energetic Draymond Green-type F showed top-notch 3 pt ability (6/10 3FG). Made some $ today! NBA 1st Rd in play

@Edward_James4 @FrankieBur Bingo! Gonzaga is attractive to certain profile types not attracted to the "bells and whistles" of major conference elite schools. And they have blazed their own successful path in that regard
@Edward_James4 @FrankieBur That was not my question.  Gonzaga always recruits well for their system and in their own way.  The question was: "tell me last Top 25 player they have beat North Carolina, Duke, Kansas, Arizona and UCLA for?"
@FrankieBur Gonzaga is an outstanding program but please tell me last Top 25 player they have beat North Carolina, Duke, Kansas, Arizona and UCLA for?  Spokane ain't for everybody and sometimes factors other than pure hoops come into play

@BTRowland I wasn't talking about Young who obviously will get better in time with his efficiency although his offensive production (scoring &amp; passing) has been impressive.
@JosephGillMA Who created the "plus-minus" stat?  I want to invite him to lead the skills session of my next camp lol or fly him out to LA for a little quality time with @MGRADS to help him get up to hoop speed lol
@BTRowland Very apparent that narratives are being pushed by many in Hawks media realm to create impression certain players have great potential/talent but ignoring their current liabilities while dwelling on the negatives of others that are thought to have no positive future for the team
@BTRowland If you are going to hold Prince accountable for a sub-par defensive effort, then be fair and call out everybody else that deserves to be called out too as well as the coaching staff who, it is very apparent, are having little success motivating these guys defensively

@JosephGillMA @MGRADS The determination of that question involves tangible AND intangible factors. But a bad hoop trend that I am noticing is that too many statistical categories are being created to paint the whole picture. Exhibit #1: the "plus-minus" stat. Most worthless hoop stat in history !
@pollonpreps @RonMFlores @LACourtReport @YTthanx4pLAyin @mlacour3 I hope the former NBA stars sitting courtside at Sierra Canyon realize they are watching a future NBA star in the making: Cassius Stanley
@latsondheimer Cassius Stanley should be a 2019 McDonald's All-American.  One of the most promising NBA perimeter prospects in 2019 national class @DraftExpress @nbadraftnet @NBADraftMikeyV
RT @latsondheimer: Cassius Stanley has big third quarter. Sierra Canyon 63, Centennial 51. Stanley has 24 points.
@JosephGillMA @MGRADS Basketball is a simple game based on fundamentals.  It doesn't need 100 different analytical statistical categories for it to be understood.  Bottom line is how does a player's skill set and basketball understanding contribute to his team's success?
@JosephGillMA @MGRADS Don't necessarily disagree with that but some aspects of the game that "number crunchers" like you cannot empirically ascertain with any great specificity are the intangibles so important to hoop winning &amp; success: heart, leadership, toughness, basketball IQ, etc.
@BTRowland I think most knowledgeable people that have been watching the Hawks know that their defensive problems are a lot deeper than Prince.  I was at the Warriors game last night and that was one of the worst team defensive efforts I've seen in awhile.
