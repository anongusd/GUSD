@OliverMcGee @POTUS @realDonaldTrump @WhiteHouse @AOC @CoryBooker @BernieSanders @KamalaHarris Yes that‚Äôs about it, I only wished the maintenance guy had walked on after his escalator stopped, to see the look on the faces of the 2 Democrats, Daw.

@MrKshus0711 @billyboblouise @realDonaldTrump And it is a powerful speech and what makes it all powerful is that it is the truth and it is factually incorrect, no fake news like one gets from Jim Acosta on CNN, whenever one hears a speech  delivered in that way it is easy to listen to, because factual evidence is available

@DC_ARVSgt Yes Sarg and there are lots of jobs older guys could do like driving and moving barriers paperwork in the station and let the young bloods out do the more physical stuff, either way the police force needs to be increased by at least 25% the MP who does that would be elected no ??
@ancienthiker @DC_ARVSgt Well the government hasn‚Äôt put in much extra money really, as the extra money only took care of rising costs, there was very little to improve  or expand the service, law and order is the most important element in the country, there should never be a money problems in policing

@emsie76 @HipsterCoffeeCo @BillOReilly @UghToHillary Yes that‚Äôs what it‚Äôs called, there were more battles won with strategy then with brut force, o yes you still need the brutal elements as well, mostly the other side never seems the strategical elements until it‚Äôs to late, to effectively deploy or reply

@UlsterRugby @ChampionsCup Yes guys Quarter-finals üëç
@TommyBowe14 Yes Tommy good stuff good luck guys
@seanhannity You say Pelosi should negotiate can‚Äôt you see she is almost senile, she has lost the ability to make herself understood, when you look at her face and one sees that vacant look of bewilderment, the government is far to important to have someone like her as speake, Nancy please üé¨
@donnabrazile I didn‚Äôt think Nancy Pelosi would a problem with security hasn‚Äôt she all her criminal subversive friends out there to protect her, what I cannot understand is, what is she going out there for, or what possible Buisness has she, she‚Äôs getting it hard enough to communicate at home,
@DeltonDunn @KeepNitreeel @JackPosobiec Here Here God Bless President Trump keep him safe and well, to save America and make America great again, and stop those Democrats tearing it apart,

@ScottAdamsSays @TriaRyder There is no doubt about that, the Democrats have been receiving drug trafficking money for years, including Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer, anyone with an eye and ear on their heads will know that, why do you think they are fighting the wall ?,they have no shame or morals!
@KAG4All @PatriotSally @Trump454545 @plantlady293 @LVNancy @_IamAnita_D @cjlovesamerica @Rise1Soar2BFree @USAloveGOD @PhilMcCrackin44 Because that‚Äôs Democrats corruption at work, thankfully they are being exposed, and they will pay for their wrongs, believe me
@jojoh888 @Ms_lol_tweets What‚Äôs wrong with that woman she is not making any sense, she is sluggish in her speech, acting like a stroke victim or possibly mental problems, it‚Äôs not fair to have her at the head of government, repeating herself over and over again, fumbling with her notes, please step down
@winknews @Ms_lol_tweets I do not know what Nancy Pelosi was going to visit the troops for, she couldn‚Äôt care less about them, or maybe she was going to recruit some terrorist to bring back to the USA, or maybe she is a weapon of destruction just being there who knows
@Nigelrefowens Nigel you‚Äôre correct let‚Äôs get you in there and clean that mess up, I think you would make a good speaker, with the ability, bring order to the house
@_LoveLike_JESUS AMEN üôè
@Brian_P14 @TonyDunlap17 @GayRepublicSwag Oprah I am surprised at you the Democrats where the slave owners, do you know nothing about the civil war, the Republicans fought a war under Abraham Lincoln to free the slaves, you‚Äôr not giving him or your fellow black who gave their lives to free the country from slavery,
@UppityWilliamP @UghToHillary I hope that bastard throwing the punches has been arrested charged and got a custodial prison sentence, and put into a rehabilitation center, as he has proven to be nothing short of an wild thug animal ,
@AppSame @rwaller73 @realDonaldTrump @SenSchumer @SpeakerPelosi Get on with it you idiots, in gods name try and not look so stupid,
@cathyholton4 @KathrynKemm That woman is sowing the seeds of disaster for her self and the people she represents, civil war will be the result like what happened in Germany under Hitler, her people will be wiped out, a country is governed by consent push people to far, they will retaliate, it‚Äôs happening
@realDonaldTrump @FoxNews @JesseBWatters @greggutfeld Mr President those two couldn‚Äôt organize a booze party in a brewery when one looks into their eyes üëÄ there seems to be no one home, it‚Äôs like looking into the abyss, they both look like they‚Äôre lost, poor things, if they are not up to the job they should resign or step aside
@TomFitton @realDonaldTrump @reddit @JudicialWatch This will not end well for the FBI,  the dirty people working there will need to watch their backs, this will not end well for them, they will be exposed they need to think,  what then ?? And they have to ask, is it worth it
@realDonaldTrump Here Here for the President security and the safety of the citizens come first,
@HillaryClinton Yes but you Democrat‚Äôs don‚Äôt care you‚Äôre causing it
@Lrihendry @JanetteValenti9 @realDonaldTrump O yes we are
@rspm1230 Excuse the language, but people regurgitate better material than what she is made of, I pray to god almighty to protect the children of America from that thing, she is a hate figure without substance, how can anyone be so twisted and mentally unbalanced and get elected?
@charliekirk11 What a great idea, the problem is the Democrats will not back this as the illegal criminal elements are the ones who vote for them, most of their power bases are in the criminal world I saw film of a democrat activist stopping illegal migrants and showing them how to register
@NBCNews Brilliant now Democrats match that 20 million $ someone cares God Bless America and its citizens
@DelphicOracal1 @Clark2June You‚Äôre absolutely correct he is such a dimwit he didn‚Äôt realize he was making a case for President Trump, that the wall works and proved so by stating how tranquil it was where a wall existed, however I don‚Äôt think he got much sleep that night, his Brain  lags behind his mouth
@SarahPalinUSA @StoltzfusTonya You said it was a poetic excuse, for not building the wall, you have to realize you are dealing with two poetic people in Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi poor things never grew up
@leinsterrugby @Ross__Byrne Yes that was the move to get the adrenaline moving good stuff job done üëç

@NitrobBear @obrechtmr @SenFeinstein @SenSchumer @SpeakerPelosi There has to be a way of getting that terrorizing woman out of office, she insults the citizens of the USA üá∫üá∏ she stated the illegal criminal migrants are more American than the people already living there who built the greatest nation in the world, shame knows no bounds
@poncepete @charliekirk11 @Acosta @realDonaldTrump I don‚Äôt think he knows what he did he better stick to his day job in the circuit clowning well I have to admit he is doing a good job for  President Trump on the wall with his promotion film in supporting the wall by showing how tranquil lives are where there is a wall thank you
@charliekirk11 @Acosta @realDonaldTrump It‚Äôs hard to believe that a circus clown disguised as Jim Acosta claiming to be a CNN reporter could be so stupid to think we wouldn‚Äôt notice, the reason there are no migrants there is there is a wall, DAW, although you are a clown you have proved the Presidents wall works
@senatemajldr It‚Äôs important that the facts are demonstrated to all concerned the way senator McConnell did,  and its also important to demonstrate fraudulent criminal mental attitude of the Democrats playing politics with peoples safety and security, shame on them they have to meet the lord
@TomFitton @realDonaldTrump @JudicialWatch Well Done Tom without you and Judicial Watch all this would be swiped away and Justice lost, and that a serious crime, the Judges who oppose you also need investigating what are they hiding and why ?? Good luck Bless you üôè
@SaraCarterDC @Acosta Jim Acosta you‚Äôre an idiot you‚Äôre a fake news reporter, everything you report has to be treated as fake, I bet if you went to Afghanistan you would pick a spot and claim, look there is no war going on here I don‚Äôt know what all the fuss is about, you are a disgrace shame on you
@ShannonAirport @Munsterrugby Good luck guys
@realDonaldTrump Well done Mr President your an inspiration and you stand with the people who put their lives on the line the security personnel need all the help they can get from Congress and Government, it‚Äôs a pity there are so many Numb Sculls elected to office and cannot do the job
@Nigelrefowens @Jbeardmore Nigel you better bring those guys for a IQ test,
@WhiteHouse Democrats the President is doing his job to protect and secure the citizens now you do yours, Build the wall now
@Nigelrefowens @WelshRugbyUnion @welshpremrugby Hard men Nigel , you will need all your diplomatic and refereeing skills at that one, cheers mate üëç
@seanhannity Well Done Me President even CNN are supporting the wall, wow üòÆ, Nancy Pelosi looks like she is in shock, a well she always looks like that, can someone find a job for her to occupy her time and stop her terrifying the citizens of the country, please,
@starcrosswolf @TenquidOk @AOC That‚Äôs pure hate on legs she is sub human, she sees the open border as an open door for her illegal criminal friends to come in, I have never witnessed such a potty foul mouth or what way was she brought up, by what kind of parents, they must be ashamed of her,
@bethtcoast @Heywood98 What do you mean they look like evil, they are evil, and when one is evil it manifests itself in the face, hence the evil look, it‚Äôs a proven fact
@Lindalu827 @Marlor18 I absolutely agree with you
@MakeUSAGreat5 @Ms_lol_tweets Yes you said it all keep the pressure on the Democratic Idiots who are the cause of the government shutdown, and they like to blame someone else no ones believing you DMs
@RealSaavedra @PeterCRoberts45 Most of them don‚Äôt know how to answer a question, they are programmed only to ask, that is as far as their brains can reach poor things
@RichardTBurnett @TriaRyder You are a terrorist partly in disguise in a country, where you are allowed to talk like that, the countries you represent are not in the USA,  why don‚Äôt you go there and see how we‚Äôll you get on
@PJeannieM @MissyJo79 I do not believe millions of Americans voted for those fools, I would say illegal migrants voted for them, imported through the southern border by the Democrats
@firstcontactnow @lilBee67569241 Dumb and Dumber in what ever order you wish
@SteveDaines @ReubenHarris205 @POTUS Stevie decent people like you is what made America great, the President is another decent and  great man who is standing up to the criminal elements intrenched in the Democrat party, and presided over by, Nancy Pelosi, and Chuck Schumer, shame on them,
@UlsterRugby Well done guys mighty men thank you
@ACTBrigitte In the past witches were burned at the stake, how does one deal with them now ? Just wondering,
@ACTBrigitte Stick with it Mr President the country is behind you ü§úüëçüéÜ

@NBCNews You should apologize for being your, you are a disgrace to humanity, you‚Äôre gutter mouth has no place in society, decent people don‚Äôt talk like that, you should go to a facility and learn some manners, or maybe you like being an ugly girl, ?
@tomhappens Tom trying to extend the festivities for as long as possible who can blame one cheers ü•Ç
@Pink_About_it @TangoGSierra The fake news media has always been the enemy of the people, as I stated the Haters Creators of Rumor Spread by Fools and Accepted by Idiots, and that‚Äôs a fact, politicians play on these facts for ever, what a shame
@usminority @TangoGSierra The American people are all in agreement with the President on the border security plan, even Chuck and Nancy agree we have all witnessed their speeches stating so what has changed? Their hate for the success of the President and the facts that he has exposed their criminality
@pvtjokerus The Presidents man won that debate and so say all of us üí™üëç
@Nigelrefowens Not a chance Nigel you‚Äôre going to be immortal, trust me, cheers üçª mate üëç
@sssnakeplissken @WhatTheFFacts That young chaps got good taste I can see it in his face, or is it curiosity and you know what killed the cat
@RealCandaceO @UghToHillary @AOC stupidity knows no bounds lady, the President is not lying about illegal migrants, you lady are confusing immigrants with illegal migrants as usual the President has no problem with immigration as that is documented  and securitized and legal, thousands of criminal migrants no no
@NBCNews @NBCNightlyNews Well government workers go after Chuck and Nancy it‚Äôs their fault
@JackPosobiec @Turk182_JCP I told you it was coming, there will be more you know Isaac Newton‚Äôs 3rd law of relativity, waiting for the reaction, praise the lord for for that man hope he will be ok
@standfortruth10 @MissyJo79 @FoxNews @realDonaldTrump The Democrats Do Not Care the people will have to stand tall, what stupid people like the Democrats don‚Äôt realize a country is governed and policed by consent, take that away what then, anarchy, push the people to far, Nancy And Chuck you will regret it
@ACTBrigitte @jules618790 That‚Äôs correct they will run out of illegal and ineligible voters to keep their farcical corrupt criminals party in government, George Washington and the founding fathers will not be resting peacefully, with the ongoing civil mess the Democrats have cast on their legacy shameful
@pborch Run her out of town now that‚Äôs trouble in the making, she is also unconstitutional because of her threats to the security of the nation
@RealBasedMAGA @Zwoodbutcher General Keene its people of your caliber who has Earned and Deserves the respect of the nation, that the stupid political people should listen to, you are the security expert here, and what you stated is common sense, how does one make them listenLord Bless you General  thank you
@robertinreydon @Femi_Sorry @s_peplow This type of harassment should not be allowed in any country the police should be able to detain these thugs that is not peaceful protest, I am not siding either way I am only referring to the bullying thuggish behavior not acceptable on British streets
@MikeStuchbery_ @EUflagmafia @dunc_saboteur That foul mouth should be locked up in a mental facility, he is the one who is not British, decent British people don‚Äôt act like that
@DC_ARVSgt Dogs are fantastic they give everything and demand nothing except they want your company and love that‚Äôs not a lot to ask
@TMURPH88 @Heywood98 @SpeakerPelosi @SenSchumer I believe the time has come to run Nancy and Chuck out of town like the old days
@LucetVeritas @smart_ass_lynn @Nielsen Well if that‚Äôs their attitude Nancy might as well go back on vacation again, as it is no wall no government Democrats caused the shut down, remember that fact
@MAGAGirl10 @Biedaboo @BarackObama @realDonaldTrump There we go again President Obama Rip off    President Trump taking care of the people,  good should prevail over evil,‚òùÔ∏è, unless you‚Äôre a heartless Democrat, then the role is reversed, to a world of murder, Drugs, Cop Killers, fake news,

@WayneDupreeShow @BoboMarilyn Well done Judicial Watch that‚Äôs what‚Äôs needed and I believe elections should be rerun in any area where where large numbers of illegal and ineligible voters were registered it could make the difference, good luck and well done Bless you
@V_actually @jonhsanders2 What an idiot how could anyone take that foolish excuse for a human seriously, go find somewhere to hide and stop frightening people with your words of no meaning to anything or anyone, resign Nancy
@TheRightMelissa @WHwttP1 @realDonaldTrump Obama was bad for everyone and every where he went, all times lining his pockets, just like all Democrats do
@TomFitton @RepJoeWilson @realDonaldTrump @RashidaTlaib So when Joe Wilson tells the truth they wanted to attack him and the Democrats lie every time they open their mouth, their gutter mouths and vulgar language knows no bounds shame on them, but then that‚Äôs what you get when you deal with lowlife
@JesseGramling @WHwttP1 @CharismaticRob @SenSanders @SpeakerPelosi Yes you are correct the wall will happen one way or another, with the help of decent law abiding citizens good luck
@RL9631 @ChucksWife1973 @SenSchumer @POTUS @realDonaldTrump @SenateGOP @SpeakerPelosi Schumer understands but he has no backbone, and as for translating it for Pelosi her brain is fried with hate one can see by looking at her she‚Äôs not in good health, and also she is so in deep with criminality she cannot get out, she is in a very awkward position, just resign
@TrueEyeTheSpy @Lori85136760 Well said good will prevail, thank the lord for President Donald Trump, keep him safe and good luck üëç
@RichardWeaving @AcidRayneStorm That is what will keep President Trump in The White House for the next 6 years, he could go down as one of the greatest Presidents the country ever had, look Law and order, Jobs, National security, good health care, tackling Drug and People traffickers, it goes on, God Bless D.T.
@PurpleIsCovfefe @CindyBe87902296 Now you‚Äôre talking my language, follow the money it will lead you to the culprit, and an audit with proper due diligence by tax experts will expose a multitude you‚Äôll see üôè
@VP @VictoriadParks2 @POTUS The only ones not working Chuck and Nancy a pair of fraudsters, not fit for purpose, puppets of evil drug lords they are behind these Caravans and people trafficking, shame on you two, the lord almighty will get you, how do you sleep??
@LoriinUtah @jonhsanders2 You got it in one, in the past Republicans backed down, the Democrats have to release President Trump is a very different animal, he will root out all the corruption waged by Democrats their fake news and lies will catch up with them, and good will prevail over evil, Chuck/Nancy

@GregHalversonCO @Ms_lol_tweets What a disgrace to humanity to have that thing call itself human it is not, I can only try to imagine what kind of hellhole she lives in to have access to that type of language, that belongs in the gutter, ordinary decent people will not listen to that filth,

@dbongino Nancy Pelosi you‚Äôre not interested in the constitution you have broken everything the constitution stands for, you break its rules, and above all the constitution was drawn up to like the Magna Carta to protect the citizens from people like you, and your Algebraic sum equal O

@bennyjohnson Insults are complements from those who know no better, and in this case it‚Äôs 100% true
@SaraCarterDC @sara And rightly so that‚Äôs what it is people are pussyfooting around, call it what it is a national security emergency, just like the Democrats
@TomFitton How did an idiot like that get elected to anything, I think she got a fright afterwards, more to come watch out
@JosephB96570073 Abraham Lincoln said the same thing that it would start from within and it does sound like the Democrats üëç
@CoastalAudiox @Ms_lol_tweets @IngrahamAngle @realDonaldTrump The Democrats are definitely more interesting in helping the illegal alien migrants, and drug cartels, people trafficking than they are the American people, you have to ask why, there is huge amounts of money corruption flowing their way, no ??
@Ciarabelles Arrest them bring them before the courts Jail them if need be
@Nigelrefowens You guys take care of our Nigel we need him back in good shape üèâcheers happy new year üéÜ
@mel_faith1 @Heywood98 Hank Johnson as usual got it wrong the Democrats were the ones who owned slaves, Republicans did not, also people who live out in the country side live longer than city folk also the Drug dealers and social spongers as well as drug users all vote Democrat they do not live longer

@RudyGiuliani @firesnuffer Then that law has to be addressed ASAP, there shouldn‚Äôt be any safe havens in any country for criminals so government do you‚Äôre job, protect the people that‚Äôs what you were elected to do
@RealBasedMAGA @esme35975435 That didn‚Äôt matter to them they were in power, now that the Republicans are in its not ok, which again shows their two faced hypocrisy, you also have to look at CNN for their role who is paying them ?? Drugs ?
@Heywood98 @Cuds_1246 @1acemadsen1 What Democrats are doing is that Abraham Lincoln warned Americans about when he said, America will never be destroyed from the outside, if we falter and loose our freedom it will be because we destroyed ourselves, and that is exactly what Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi are doing
@beth2_k3a @leslieh707 He has a plan which was voted on and passed, now they want to change their minds, so they can import illegal migrant voters, get a life
@Living4Earth @VinaigretteGirl @politicususa When the Government doesn‚Äôt work you shut it down, if you‚Äôre car breaks down you take it to the repair shop, after it‚Äôs repaired you put it back on the road again, and so when the government is repaired it will be allowed to work again thank you, sue Chuck and Nancy
@RBReich @VinaigretteGirl I am sorry for your mindset,  not two more years, six more years wake up smell like coffee, look around you more jobs, more money in peoples, balance of payments coming down, better security  that‚Äôs what people want and that‚Äôs what they are getting,  the Democrats trying destroy
@PrisonPlanet @inittowinit007 Catch that bastard, let him release whatever he has so what, number one it will catch him, and the illegally obtained material cannot be used in court, the people who died in 9/11 deserve more than this, some lowlife trying to profit on their misfortune, how low can one stoop?
@VinaigretteGirl @ThatTimWalker Well if it was criminally obtained, that makes it illegal,  so why is the PM. not pursuing that aspect as she was against leaving in the first place?,
@UKDefJournal I was once struck with lightning flying over Wales all the flight instruments went crazy and I got a burning smell,  however they returned to normal and I arrived safely at destination praise the lord for that

@Don_Vito_08 @leslieh707 @realDonaldTrump @NancyPelosi Yes even Nancy Pelosi wants the wall she is so intent in her hate for the President she is blinded by the fact, which calls into question her state of mind and her ability to serve, I do believe she is suffering from some sort of mental breakdown, which is sad, take a break Nancy
@ThatTimWalker @VinaigretteGirl You cannot bin Brexit the people voted in a referendum in a Democratic country to leave and that‚Äôs It
@warrenmorgan @VinaigretteGirl @Nigel_Farage There will be no Mep.s after March I believe
@AnnCoulter @Steve5615 Yes I agree with you now to get those criminals out of the government, by what ever means I would prefer non violent, using the law, unless someone has a better idea
@realDonaldTrump President Trump will win in 2020 and after that the Republicans will win back the house mostly helped Nancy and Chuck although they don‚Äôt realize that yet
@_LoveLike_JESUS @contessalee Absolutely you can have as many Amen s üôè I absolutely agree with you Bless you

@AMike4761 @KathrynKemm That has to stop now where is the federal government, you are asking for serious trouble in future let alone now
@ArchKennedy @lilBee67569241 If the police have CCTV footage identified those and give them long prison time, if they are migrants deport them
@LBC @AnnBank41695841 @ShelaghFogarty Angela Merkel is a disaster for Germany she will cause another catastrophe situation equal to what happened when Hitler came to power she is sowing the seeds to make that happen unless the Conservative German people take control of their country they will be lost, do what Uk did
@Nigelrefowens Happy new year to you Nigel looking forward to next season and your no nonsense approach good luck mate stay well thank you
@DougDerby @trumptrain1111 Lord rest my much loved departed Dad used to say,  Gates,Walls, and locks are good for keeping decent law abiding people out, a mad man is a different animal, I am not advocating anything, as a God living Protestant Christian, I cannot vouch for the wild non believers,  Bless all
@trumptrain1111 @DougDerby I wonder how safe do Pelosi and Schumer feel they may need to bolster their own security as people are becoming outraged at their actions and inactions they have to realize there are some wild people out there, and they are committing treasonous acts, by not doing what they swore
@RealJamesWoods @DougDerby James the Democrats existence is based on fake news, lies and generated Rumors, and remember Rumor is Created by Haters, Spread by Fools, and Accepted by Idiots, how does one get past that, the President has to use what ever it takes to protect the nation 8 U.S. Code 1182 is law
@DougDerby @PaulDHeenan @thejournal_ie Well we have allow, the Prof is always correct and right even when he‚Äôs or she wrong, a little bit like a wife in an argument with you
@DougDerby @PaulDHeenan @thejournal_ie Yes you made me smile and I agree legal is not always right, if it was the Lawyers would have nothing to argue about, what I mean by legal, law and order it‚Äôs the fabric that holds normal society together, before the Magna Charta and Magna Carter were there was no law, Anarchy
@WestmonsterUK @Sturner72213136 @sajidjavid Yes deport them ASAP if you don‚Äôt more will come, put them in a RAF fat Albert put parachutes on them, fly over the territory they came from let the ramp down, connect the ripcord bye bye don‚Äôt come back, O you may keep the parachute also give them a lunch box
@LeonardCarril11 @PatriotMadd @EmmaAnn47064878 @Great_Jill @cmarinucci The Democrat lefties will always spread fake news without any foundation I take comfort from a fact, Rumors are Created by Haters, Spread by Fools and  Accepted by Idiots, that‚Äôs what the Democrats are made of
@Witsend08135301 @Agrant3595Grant Nancy you‚Äôre a hypocrite you don‚Äôt give a dam about children or god if the people riot and come after you god will forgive them, god will not forgive you, you‚Äôre creating a very dangerous situation for your self
@Cuds_1246 @gatewaypundit Those border agents should take those illegal migrants to the nearest border crossings and dump them back into Mexico hire thousands more border agents, if you need them, use guns, use gas, what ever you have to this is gone beyond a joke, remember this is the Democrats fault
@WayneDupreeShow That Woman Markel will caused another war there will be bodies in the streets of France and Germany as well as neighboring countries it will happen as sure as day and night the people will not put up with what‚Äôs happening and when they have no other way rebellion, gunfire killing

@Cuds_1246 @gatewaypundit The President is absolutely correct the Democrats are responsible especially Nancy Pelosi shame on her
@MiamiShowband @donlav Yes I absolutely agree, those officers in charge should be prosecuted it was a most hideous crime against one of their own, the Garda are a brotherhood and they are supposed to look after each other, Maurice is a strong man lucky, his wife and family could never be compensated
@TomFitton @tigerandyx9 @JudicialWatch Tom you‚Äôre doing a fantastic job exposing these political criminals in the Democratic Party, classic wolf in sheep‚Äôs clothing, they all sounded so pious and nice, but remember the best conmen are, the best salesman are, they wouldn‚Äôt know the truth if it bit them on the nose
@HLAurora63 @neasham_sherrie All of you so called mental health doctors need, mental health treatment your selves your profession is one of the most controversial professions in medicine two or three you go into court and give totally different diagnoses for the same person,  give us a break,

@YeahSureRight1 @BobBrinson1 Yes you could right the pease loving nations of the world create a democrat country where people live in harmony, migrants come in from countries where they say there is unrest,they say they want a better life, before you know it they are creating unrest in our country wake up
@My2CentsXOGRIT @o1wbQ5uObJ9GeBF @chuckschumer @realDonaldTrump What an idiot, even when I make allowances for his 94 years old still cannot make out what way his failing mind works, yes? O are you sure? Yes, I was going by his looks, thank you, well it seems he‚Äôs not 94 years old my mistake, making allowances for the old timer, even worse
@Dlw20161950 @MissyJo79 Yes you got it in a nut shell, you call it by it‚Äôs real name, Harboring criminals and fugitives, one has to ask why, there is obviously a payout why else? They call them sanctuary which implies animals or people in danger need sanctuary, Prison apply to criminal and fugitives
@BobBrinson1 And about time you cannot have criminal safe havens what a joke yes prosecute the politicians who promote these criminal safe havens
@DC_ARVSgt Well Sarg words fail most people in a situation like this, where did lead by example go, I am reminded of the proverb, (The last refuge of a scoundrel is politics ) you may be able grant a fools pardon on that, Happy new year to you and your family and stay safe in 2019 bless you
@ThePaulColton Yes I agree, but what about Keith Earls something else, a tough hard game,  Munster deserved the win, and that coming from a Leinster man  then that‚Äôs Rugby all friends afterwards in the bar, Happy new Reverend Bishop Paul Colton and best wishes to you and your family in 2019 üôè

@marklevinshow @UghToHillary They used to burn witches, in the old days in The British isles, I am not putting ideas in anymore, just a history lesson you know what I mean, and you know there are still witches around,
@LeonardCarril11 @Great_Jill @PatriotMadd @EmmaAnn47064878 @cmarinucci I just have praise the lord for the President and the Republicans üôè
@LeonardCarril11 @Great_Jill @PatriotMadd @EmmaAnn47064878 @cmarinucci Please do not connect me with any one or anything that says anything wrong about President Donald Trump, he is a breath of fresh air, and he will win the 2020 election in a landslide, help him build the wall, and root out corruption in the Democrats, and deport the criminals
@TomFitton @Zarnie50 @BreitbartNews There is a need for more practical law men like Sheriff Adam Christianson who the political representatives should pay more attention to, this is a man with great abilities, in his job as a lawman when he says he needs something, to combat crime for Christ sake listen to him
@hotairblog @arkiegal411 She should do to prison, and also stripped of Mayorship, who needs credibility when you have her, is she on the take from the traffickers as well, into a federal prison you have to go
@yaf @Zarnie50 @DineshDSouza Yes I like that that‚Äôs the only way it will work thank you
@RodStryker @TenquidOk Pelosi is a complete and utter disgrace she is without an ounce of humanity, if you look at the way she speaks, she is a mentally deranged person, when she answers that mother, our people are not breaking the law, she is insane, no doubt
@heyitsCarolyn @rjones8194 Build the wall, build the wall
@MattalianoGuy @inittowinit007 What an idiot, could someone show this clown what he said, and stat he never said it, the camera did not lie this is why this man should be in a mental hospital

@KLSouth @PeterCRoberts45 Pelosi are you looking you heartless thing, are you having a good time on holidays, Officer Singh‚Äôs wife and baby are not, shame on you
@1776_ben @Heywood98 Shame on you California you‚Äôre a disgrace, there must be something the senate can do
@BobBrinson1 That will never happen there will be war if that happens mark my words, if that is forced on European nations there will be a 3rd World War
@cmarinucci @LeonardCarril11 The President and the senate does not want to shut down the border, he wants to build a security wall to protect people‚Äôs lives and two faced Democrats well not step up and do what they have already voted for, the boss has to use what ever he has to achieve this, Democrats fault
@RealJack @trocbe I agree with you, shame on those small narrow minded people, they really don‚Äôt matter, people will see through their fake minds
@IWiIlkaga @b_pinheiro21 @politico Just build the wall where ever the money comes from, close the border until the wall is built
@IWiIlkaga @b_pinheiro21 @politico I know I have watched the speeches time and time again they made political ground promising to build the wall, so now that President Trump is getting on with it they appose it, what is wrong with those people, Israel and Turkey have walls that work why not US Mexico border?
@AmyMek @1Davie1 Germany wake up get your right wing government in place before it‚Äôs to late, double the police force, and crackdown on illegal migrants thugs you have to take control of law and order or your lost
@IngrahamAngle @1Davie1 Pressure should be put on Mexico to stop the migrants getting there, if not close the border with Mexico in til they do, then double the size of Ice and border security round up all illegals and deport them,
@plantlady293 @Hellrazor1776 Nancy you‚Äôre looking like a lost soul on your way to no where, why not have a little talk with your religious advisor vicar, paster, priest what ever and they may be able to help you, because you look troubled to me, you need to prepare yourself to meet your maker, not doing well
@RomanEcho @JillJillhe The reason Nancy Pelosi is on holidays is she simply doesn‚Äôt care what happens to the people, she puts up to being liberal, when in fact she sees the people as plebes, and she herself the plutocrat and that is the simple fact
@TrumperSeaney @Heywood98 @realDonaldTrump @wolfblitzer Brilliant idea get on with it, locküîí it down  Mexico government will then step up and help its in their interest
@GOPLeader @UghToHillary I am so so glad these cowards are in custody do not give them bail, praise to the lord for all law enforcement officers especially Sheriff Youngblood who let these criminals and others know you will not get away this and now, political reps. do you job, come clean start working

@Education4Libs @PTorney Now then you put it in the right order the people will stand with their President the more he exposes corruption the more the people back him it is going on far to long, it is getting to the point one cannot tell the Democrat from the criminal or maybe they are one and the same ?
@rising_serpent @SusanKMunson2 Sheriff you are a brave man, you speak the truth with passion and I commend you for that, every branch of law enforcement should work together and freely share information in the interest of the law abiding citizens, and any political leadership who disagree need B investigated
@ChuckCallesto O no you don‚Äôt President Trump will win the 2020 with a landslide, why do you think he became president, because the people were fed up with Democrats corruption, or do you not realize that, you are a comedian if you think otherwise, O you are a comedian, well that explains it
@CB618444 @ChucksWife1973 I believe she should be arrested and charged and if she admits that she did warn them she has to prison, not fined, prison
@DrMartyFox @GalianaIII @realDonaldTrump I absolutely agree with you Democrat‚Äôs your responsible for the officers death shame on you, you‚Äôre a bunch of clowns, not fit for purpose, and you will be exposed.
@larryelder @hinesriley @SenSchumer Schumer do you realize how stupid you sound, probably not, if you did you would commit yourself to a mental health therapist,

@politico @IWiIlkaga If the Democrats are not careful they could lose a lot more, this President will not be bullied, So Nancy you better think again,
@GOPChairwoman @lilBee67569241 @realDonaldTrump I believe the Democrats are running out of the, The American people are now seeing them for what they are, at the next election, they will not be able to explain their wrongs away, Schumer won‚Äôt care he‚Äôll be will past it, others might worry about their party

@MazurikL @BrantVoss These are the idiots we are dealing with, of course Jesus comes first, you never see people seeking asylum or trying to get into a communist country, it‚Äôs always they want to come to capitalism and conservative states, ever wonder why, it‚Äôs the only way to create good standards,
@Quoimio Tom you have to realize you are dealing with a Person it very low intelligence in this area, Nancy is an academic and as you may know academics have to be told what to do, they are not equipped with the skills needed for leadership or consequences of inaction, a misfit in place?

@JVER1 @rjones8194 Well done Mr President it‚Äôs about time now you don‚Äôt have to pay them to hate the USA
@Navy_Lady_45 @ClwtrBkAtty @Alyssa_Milano There is no place in world for that way of thinking, women are equal to men and lots of cases more senior
@ACTforAmerica @JudyMarie4DT Socialism has never worked in the world and never will, look at Russia, China, Cuba, the people changed to capitalism and they prospered, that‚Äôs the answer
@charliekirk11 @Steve5615 I agree with you about being spectacular I am unable to answer why it‚Äôs not taught more widely I have the King James Bible and often look at the way I might do something and a read to reflect and refresh and pick out parts that are relevant to what I am doing, and personal to me
@GardaTraffic You are very welcome and happy Christmas to all members of an Garda,  and thank you for keeping us safe,  remembering those members who lost their lives in the line of duty, and a special thanks to those on duty over Christmas well Done

@Toby2innh @TrumpGirlDebbie @jsolomonReports @POTUS @NancyPelosi @SenSchumer @realDonaldTrump Mr President it speaks for itself  that‚Äôs not fake news, if you keep this up you will have 693 promises delivered by the end of your 1st  term, god knows what by the end of your 2nd term, we will then look back and say what happened to the Democrats someone will ask who are they
@AerLingus Merry Christmas üéÑ Aerlingus  and all your stuff, thank you for looking after me during the year, wish you good luck in 2019 üçÄüëç
@breakfastattigf What ever has to be done build the wall, Democrats say the wall won‚Äôt work,  prisons have walls to keep people in, walls also keep people out and people safe, Democrats you‚Äôre not entitled to be that stupid, the country cannot afford you that privilege, cop on
@realDonaldTrump @D1sc41 @Anna_Giaritelli @dcexaminer And it will keep on climbing as people see through the fake news coming from especially CNN shame on them, they have no credibility
@AnnCoulter @D1sc41 Because the Democrats have organized the Caravan through their criminal associates and drug traffickers, why else would they be apposed to the wall
@BlueSea1964 @DreamCrafterB The police should have let the angry crowd have him for an hour or so with more baseball bats , then give him life in prison without parole
@KMGGaryde @seecyn5858 @realDonaldTrump By the time President Trump finishes in six years,  the leadership in the Democrats will be in nursing homes with care minders, those who are not will be dead,
@RealJamesWoods @EversFam Are they mad so the rule of law doesn‚Äôt matter anymore, sack those Judges

@NettaBean21 @GOPChairwoman @o1wbQ5uObJ9GeBF Insults are complements from those who know no better
@3ku1 @GOPChairwoman @o1wbQ5uObJ9GeBF Trump is saving America rebuilding its industry, the dollar going up in value, job creation going up, balance of payments coming down, he is on a roll, that‚Äôs all the people want money and jobs, by the time he retires as President in years time Judge him then, he will win a 2nd
@inittowinit007 @jonhsanders2 @POTUS @realDonaldTrump @RealJamesWoods @DonaldJTrumpJr @_America_First @PamB60 @SassyT_Joy @LoriinUtah @BCMsolt @IWasHrren @bonniemurphy @charliekirk11 @realtalkbtr That seems about the right way, but it is important you take them for a walk every day, they won‚Äôt eat much by the look of them, and who knows they must be good for something, you might want to keep them as pets,
@ABritperspect @jonhsanders2 Another reason for Brixet where the hell are going, if people are offended by the National flag get out and don‚Äôt come back, round these people up and deport them,  like the USA make it an offense to disrespect the national flag
@ConorGogarty @Nigelrefowens @NathanMattick8 Nice one Nigel you‚Äôre the man üëçüèâ
@ljmwsmith @b77_sarah Now there‚Äôs a brave last
@BobBrinson1 @NancyPelosi Is Jed and Granny looking at Nancy Pelosi or Chuck or both maybe
@VHayek214 @Heywood98 @DNC @GOP @POTUS @realDonaldTrump Now Democrats you‚Äôre been left out what are you going to do now, it will cost you at election time, mark my word üò•
@sxdoc @Heywood98 @realDonaldTrump Now that‚Äôs the way forward scalable by scalable absolutely correct, now to get the Democrats to put their minds where their mouths are, and they will achieve credibility which they so badly need, or have the criminals such a grip on them they cannot get out, Maybe????
@BobBrinson1 And his drug trafficking friends who fund his operation shame on you
@MiriamOCal @RTERadio1 Miriam of all your programs either radio or tv,your interview with Graham and Louise Jones and bro Rob, was the most inspiring and heartwarming I have listened to Graham was such a remarkable beautiful person praise the lord for for his life, his wife and family,and Rob bless you
@MaryMcAuliffe4 @MiriamOCal Eamon DeValera and the Catholic Church, especially Bishop John Charles Mcquaid will go down in history as two oppressors of women‚Äôs rights in Ireland thanks to President Mary Robinson, and other strong women like her in the media there is a dramatic change in balance thank you
@MiriamOCal Well Done Gavin children are great Judges of character, as well as the music üéºGavin you score top marks on both fronts, merry Christmas üéÑ
@KayBurley @donlav I was so sorry to hear of the passing of Paddy Ashdown, I met Paddy many years ago and had great respect and admiration for him, I recently communicated with him in relation to Briexit, as a military man he was a strategist, praise the lord for paddy‚Äôs life and achievements RIP
@JOEdotie If that driver didn‚Äôt know he was doing wrong  he shouldn‚Äôt have a driving license, I even believe he needs a minder to go shopping well done Garda

@Grommet05700268 @BreitbartNews @o1wbQ5uObJ9GeBF I support multi cultural societies I support humanitarian aid, i do not support criminals who steal from the caravan people with false promises, don‚Äôt support Drug or child sex traffickers who are financing the caravan, if people come in legally they are welcome I‚Äôm color blind
@romfordroy @AnnBank41695841 @DavidLammy That‚Äôs another reason for Brexit and Irexit a bunch of inept clowns looking to take over our sovereignty, and makes mess of our lives even more than they have already, that Brussels outburst has echoes of a little guy with with a little mustache from the past, no way EU
@AnEnglishRevolt @Biedaboo So that‚Äôs a good argument for Brexit if I ever heard one, I voted for Brexit for all those reasons, and the fact that a lot of people today, don‚Äôt have respect for authority, the fact that we and these disrespectful people are able to live as we do, is the democracy we live in
@SenateGOP @IWiIlkaga What changed the simple answer is nothing , the Democrats only ever talked about it, but never did anything, fake statements on TV brain washed people into thinking they were taking action, now that the President is doing something about it frightens them , hypocrites game over
@charliekirk11 @BRumbolo That is one of the best arguments I have heard so far building the wall well stated thank you üôè hope you Democrat‚Äôs are listening and more important heeding, now talk about money üí∞???
@TheRealShaunaMT @blingarama @LindseyGrahamSC You got it in one, the right to vote should only be afforded to a citizen
@MrWyattEarpLA @seecyn5858 Take a little comfort from an old proverb, ( insults are complements from those who know no better) when some people loosing they‚Äôll resort to lies, name calling, and fake news, and that tells you their caliber, they are entitled to a fools pardon poor things
@DubFireBrigade Well Done Guys üëçyou made someones Christmas üéÑ a little happier,and happy Christmas to all Fire Brigades throughout the country especially those who are on duty over Christmas, you do a fantastic job Thank you üôè stay safe

@RealJack @BoboMarilyn Hope you‚Äôre correct
@b77_sarah @Cuds_1246 I wonder what the Pilgrim Fathers would have to say if they came back today,  what a mess you have made of what we gave you, President Donald Trump is the only hope of salvaging the country from the brink of disaster, Gods speed Mr President keep going you have right on your side
@BreitbartNews @o1wbQ5uObJ9GeBF Well done Austria at least some one is getting sense, the EU is not working, it will never work politically, it has a chance as a trade group nothing else,
@dmills3710 @Cuds_1246 @realDonaldTrump @POTUS @freedomcaucus @GenFlynn Yes you are correct the only person with B***s in the country‚Äôs leadership you are correct to back him
@CBPArizona @CBP Load them up take them back to where they come from, if they come back lock them up for ten years that will stop them coming, stop making life soft for them, you are creating mega problems and trouble for your children‚Äôs future,  wake up
@gmw3751 That is disrespectful and disgusting what is going on, the world is gone mad, you give a vote to someone who hardly knows who he is, let alone who or what he is voting for ?? That lady needs a different job doing what I.have no idea??
@AnnCoulter @JakeSno46 The Democrats know it will work that‚Äôs why they are oppressed to it, their friends won‚Äôt be able to travel freely with their drug trafficking, simple answer
@kwilli1046 @deltacrook Well done young man üëç for me you are the winner
@kwilli1046 @deltacrook You have made a friend for life that guy will remember you for ever, you are so kind, you will have a lot of luck in your life thank you üôè
@DC_ARVSgt Sgt Harry I had very little to do with my name when I was christened , John-Joe, the hyphen (-) makes it one, like Johnny Cash and a boy named Sue üò•ü§ú have a good day
@NancyPelosi @OCNaNa2013 Nancy you‚Äôre the one who is responsible for the shutdown of government, your so full of hate for the President it‚Äôs consuming you, you should be a better person than this, humanity and the people and their security, is what‚Äôs important not your private war with President
@JayVanorman @Clofconnie Ted got it in the best way to explain and most important reasons for the wall and shows the Democrats for what they are, their hate for the President seems to be more important to them than the people‚Äôs security, they should face facts President Trump will win another term,
@GOPChairwoman @o1wbQ5uObJ9GeBF Which proves the Democrats are out to destroy the USA a lot of people believe they are involved in the drug trafficking cartels, criminals gangs ect, why else would they have voted the way they did?
@TomFitton @TrumpGirlDebbie Bring them to a border post and send back to Mexico do not give them asylum remember that the President said anyone entering illegally will not get asylum, send them back
@DC_ARVSgt A yes Sarg. I like the little bit of sarcasm re good luck with future insurance, however that‚Äôs a very real threat to a driver hopefully that will make one think twice, Merry Christmas to you and all police especially those who are on duty over the Christmas break, thank you üôè
@TerryKalUSMC What a great idea
@donlav Very good point Don drones could be a very real problem and the ability to weaponize is definitely a problem it needs to be addressed now and not when something happens tsk.
@GardaTraffic Well done Tallaght Garda, I think we will nominate you for Xfactor, need a manager? A just asking, and happy Christmas to all members of the Garda,  especially those on duty over Christmas, thank you and stay safe, bless you all

@AngelaMinear1 @realDonaldTrump @teddybe54765526 Just wait for the fraudulent and criminal facts that is about to hit the media in the coming month or so involving the Dems. You will be shocked üò≥ you know what is said about the last laugh ?
@Michhelleeex Now the people are behind the President, and make sure everyone knows the Democrats tried to stop progress on the wall, their associates won‚Äôt be able to walk freely into the country with drugs and people trafficking, child abuse, Democrats it‚Äôs over
@realDonaldTrump @teddybe54765526 Bravo Mr President I had no doubt that you would have the wall built, even the Democrats realize that fact now, their loss they could have been part of it, sadly for them they lost again God Bless America and happy Christmas and New Years greetings
@owillis @colettebrowne You will have the wall thank you üôè
@IndoSport @leinsterrugby Johnny you have now got as many awards as Rory, We won‚Äôt know  to give you two next year, congratulations Johnny happy Christmas and New Years many thanks Mate üëçüçæüèâ
@jonsnowC4 @donlav This could be the end for drones or at least, register and issue a license to own one, make it law ?
@realDonaldTrump @IWiIlkaga Well done President Trump,  we all knew the Caravan was the brainchild of the Democrats to try and cause as many problems as possible for the President, well it blew up in their faces, the ICE police and the Military did a great job, the fake news manufacturers are silent üéÑüéÜ
@ZonePhysics @patrick_emmet There wouldn‚Äôt be much use for that kind of thing where I live, we use our thumbs holding the lighter in our hands it works very well, üëç
@realDonaldTrump @IWiIlkaga Well done guys good fun
@charliekirk11 Now how about that, next one please Democrat‚Äôs keep on scoring own goals, when will they ever learn, probably never

@Independent_ie That‚Äôs Rich coming from Jeremy Corbyn he should at least have a little respect for the lady, some  people are using his name as an icon for stupidity in politics
@consmover @rwaller73 I believe Chuck and Nancy have already lost their minds, have you not seem Nancy been interviewed lately, she keeps forgetting and not sure what to say, Chuck is so filled with emotion over the President he cannot concentrate on the job he was elected to do, I wish them well
@MAGA_United @donnia8789 Well done to everyone the wall is getting built by the President and the patriotic citizens loyal to the USA üá∫üá∏ the people who say, ( I love the USA) with feeling and mean it,
@imogensound @BrianKolfage @FoxNews @BreitbartNews @RyanAFournier @MarkDice @GOPLeader @mattgaetz @kristina_wong @gehrig38 @DonaldJTrumpJr Your language is ugly and disrespectful, when people resort like this, you need anger management, people sending money for the wall are called patriots, and law abiding citizens, who want the nation to be safe for the good of its citizens, maybe you have a problem with that
@marklevinshow @austinrokker The problem is, if the new evidence coming out now about thhad been available before the election the result would have been a lot different the next election is only a few years away the Dems. better start doing their jobs or they will suffer
@TheMarkPantano @austinrokker It is one of the most important items in the USA at the moment, anybody thought of a name for the wall it has to have Trump in it
@BrianKolfage @FoxNews @BreitbartNews @RyanAFournier @MarkDice @GOPLeader @mattgaetz @kristina_wong @gehrig38 @DonaldJTrumpJr Must be killing the Democrats, make it tall make it strong, keep their Drug and criminal supporters and funder friends out
@SophieLong01 That‚Äôs what moms do, and the cost for you is love her
@ChristusPatriot @donnia8789 No effort should be spared in finding these mindless criminal thugs, give  them all 20 years there is plenty of evidence on video
@IsraelUSAforevr @LauraDiebra Let them know that anything that aids the illegal aliens in getting to their destination will be destroyed this is a war, you always destroy the enemies supplies, go legal or go home
@Fake_Ljaschko @JudyMarie4DT @OnlineMagazin Fantastic did you not have a whip or a leather strap, just so he remembers his visit to your house
@barmore27 @BPPope Absolutely correct to build the wall, why not fund the wall out of the defense budget, after all the wall is a defensive item, and the Caravan invaders are a threat to national security, and I believe President Trump is in charge of that account so  one wall please, thank you üôè
@Non_MSM_News @EversFam I new he would find a way üëç
@iamfearlesssoul @standbyme1972 That‚Äôs a very sad Attitude if you think some people don‚Äôt like you, then they don‚Äôt matter, be sure lots do like you don‚Äôt be insecure be positive, join the self admiration society cheers

@SiCarswell @IrishTimes Have a bit of manners, and remember you were a guest
@TexasVengeance @MARINE_99ZULU The Democrats didn‚Äôt care who dies as long as they can use situations to attack President Trump, they can‚Äôt use the migrants caravan in Mexico anymore so they have abandoned them, they are immoral, lying leaches and they will be exposed the President doesn‚Äôt play by their rules
@IrishTimesWorld Well done Belgium, there will be a lot more to follow your example, about time we woke up to the spongers
@IvanYatesNT @HenryMcKean @AXA Thanks Ivan good idea please slow down save lives

@Seanfhear59 @MaryOGrady8 @campaignforleo @rtenews What a laugh the yellow vest demonstration in France has nothing to do with socialism it‚Äôs the complete opposite, they want the hard right to take over and stop bowing to liberals and socialism, and put hard line conservatives in power to stop handouts by the socialist government

@realDonaldTrump @IWiIlkaga Well done üëç President Trump you‚Äôre on a roll
@TelBabe @FergKerry I believe the EU will not survive,it started out as a trading group, that‚Äôs where it should have stayed I voted for Brexit, I would vote for Irexit given the choice,clever people lean to the right foolish people to the left, every army needs Conservative Generals Margret Thatcher
@DavidKing478 @RobertL29302273 @AGLynch @Comey @POTUS Unbelievable but true they have to answer the questions they cannot get away from the wrong they did and expect to get away with it, or possibly they do expect to get away, expose their deeds, criminality cannot be part of government the law must be obeyed otherwise you‚Äôre lost
@Jamierodr10 @jonhsanders2 He knows a lot more than you and your other fraudulent friends, you‚Äôre going to be exposed,

@piersmorgan @LesleyJ62456075 I actually believe the EU will self destruct,as other countries are not happy with Brussels, it interferes to much in the lives of people and Countries who have very little in common with each other, I voted Brexit in the referendum I have duel citizenship I would vote Irexit yes
@KilclooneyJohn @LesleyJ62456075 That will never happen, there will be a couple of documents with some boxes to be ticked, just for regulation purposes, nothing else, the International aviation organization might even forget about it, ah we must get that done, scare tactics that‚Äôs all
@secretstranger9 @LighteningBolt9 That‚Äôs a stupid question it‚Äôs twenty years ago, since that was written off as was the United Kingdom‚Äôs war debt to the USA.
@Stop_The_EU @LighteningBolt9 The reason why? The Second World War was caused by trying to collect such debts from the First World War, and it wasn‚Äôt secretly written off, none of it was ever collected it was never ever going to be collected what do want a Third World War? Where have you been?
@realDonaldTrump @AZGoodFella2 The Democrats have been scamming for ever using taxpayers money through schemes that allow ways to skim their share into various funds for themselves, it‚Äôs disgusting, now they are owned by these helpers and cannot get out, come clean before it‚Äôs to late, President Trumps coming
@Heywood98 @BobBrinson1 @BreitbartTexas Yes build the wall Nancy P. Help your President and your nation and you salvage some little bit of credibility and stop looking like a bad person women are supposed to be better than that, what‚Äôs your problem?
@MagniFieri @austinrokker Yes you have the answers, she was taken thousands of miles by her trafficking criminal family, abused not fed left for dead, the Democrats who encouraged them to come to the USA who‚Äôs goal is to create trouble for President Trump are also to blame, be careful what you wish for
@lukefitz11 No not nice

@Vicky4Trump2020 @esme35975435 @GenFlynn @realDonaldTrump @BarbaraRedgate @EricTrump @DonaldJTrumpJr @dbongino @SaraCarterDC Yes Vicky you got it in one,  they have been lying to you for years and years and it takes a strong man like President Trump to root out the villains and fraudsters and he will, it is possible that President Trump will go down as one of the greatest Presidents, and become an icon
@sherry25793049 @BoboMarilyn Yes faith is a wonderful thing, and very powerful only when we have a problem we seem to call to our faith and so, Just because you cannot see the the air doesn‚Äôt mean you stop breathing and just because you cannot see God doesn‚Äôt mean you stop believing, Amen happy Christmas all

@JOEdotie Good stuff are you both going to have a good Christmas üéÑ or just one cheers ü•Ç
@Independent_ie I don‚Äôt think the Dublin yellow jackets protesters realize the French are not protesting for socialism, they are protesting for right wing conservatism to take over, since they are hailing Donald Trump as their hero, and chanting ( Trump Trump Trump we want Trump )
@RealMattCouch @JudyMarie4DT Nice one Gary
@reveal @sonicthebadger They are still doing the same thing today shame on them
@rtenews Good luck girls have a great day keep the good work going thank you

@StopTrump2020 @jrivera64 @realDonaldTrump Help President Trump make America great again, and don‚Äôt be stupid look at who is to blame, the Democrats with their false promises, and their criminal agents in the caravan, build the wall deport them all,
@DrEtiquette @1Davie1 It‚Äôs simple the illegal traffickers are criminals and responsible for the child‚Äôs death, they were offered asylum in Mexico,  that‚Äôs the first country they landed in and that‚Äôs where they should apply, that is the law, and not some vote grabbing senators version
@maziehirono @jrivera64 Senator all that‚Äôs wrong for you is your lot are being exposed, you‚Äôre promoting drug and child trafficking,aiding criminals who have already been deported from the USA for criminality back in, you should be ashamed of yourself, to expose your countrymen to these elements
@PastorJon9 @BoboMarilyn @PatriotNurse1 What a bunch of fraudsters, they are incapable of telling the truth, they lie over and over, there has to be a way to remove these people from office, if you commit perjury in court, you can go to prison, why not put these in prison? They deceived the electorate for their gain
@IrishTimes Casey you‚Äôre an ugly dirty thing stop interfering in our country‚Äôs lives you are a disgrace to humanity go home to where ever you come from
@SealeyGerald @BobBrinson1 Yes Yes Yes he will as soon as the stupid feeble government gets their medical treatment for whatever is wrong with them, they were suffering from indecision , now they are not so sure , they should be in a nursing home, at least some of them definitely should
@STACEYDUBOIS4 @BobBrinson1 @POTUS @FLOTUS You two are looking well merry Christmas üéÅüéÑ
@ChuckCallesto I don‚Äôt mean to be mean or disrespectful to Nancy P. But she should know her limits, after looking at that press conference she‚Äôs clearly not able for her job, souring her words and suffering from indecision is not the way to run a government, clearly she needs to had the retire

@Jali_Cat @frespirit01 @HillaryClinton @DNC @TheDemocrats @CBP Jali you‚Äôre absolutely correct in your assumptions about the cases of the little girl loosing her life, the new low the Democrats have stooped to knows no bounds,  when they caused the situation in the first place, and I believe it will emerge they are behind this caravan??
@JudicialWatch @Clofconnie @realDonaldTrump Obama you‚Äôre going to get caught
@thejournal_ie Not long enough time he should have got life for that dirty thing
@robbystarbuck @MARINE_99ZULU @realDonaldTrump @MSNBC @CNN @washingtonpost Yes where is CNN now this is what President Trump is all about Buisness, jobs, growth in the USA economy, taking people out of poverty, not through handouts for something they did not earn, but jobs to give them self respect and purpose in life, and create better communities üëç
@sxdoc @blingarama Well done üëç President Trump you have to look at the areas where, because of their voting habits, the Democrats have been taking jobs away and allowing areas to run down these people needs your help in bringing balance to their lives thank you
@frfrankpavone @MaryOGrady8 Are you running out of victims
@GOP @TerryKalUSMC @PressSec Well said and you are absolutely correct in your comments the sooner the Democrats step up and do their job and stop trying to score tricks the better it will be for all concerned
@FAIRImmigration @relaxnpensacol1 @onenewsnowcom That‚Äôs my point why will they not listen because it suits them
@RealJamesWoods @blingarama These are the things the Democrats do to get their way, bullying, lying, cheating, fraudulent, fake news, assisting criminals, drug trafficking, child traffickers, illegal aliens, Rapist, all assisted by the Democrats,  shame on you

@DC_ARVSgt Yes Sarg the police do their job well and some Judges are handing down judgments that do not respect the seriousness of the crime, stiffer sentence bigger prisons so what, make those thugs think twice about the consequences ?, like Isaac Newton‚Äôs third law of relativity ?
@ZonePhysics @patrick_emmet Don‚Äôt put that on my desk I‚Äôll get no work done
@DC_ARVSgt One cannot beat the dogs criminals look out fantastic üëç

@TerryKalUSMC The Democrats are proving the fact that they  lie they are hypocrites and they will be exposed, if they don‚Äôt get their act together soon they are in danger of destroying their party for good, work together for the good of the country and the people, from a decent opposition
@Lady_Vi_2U @frespirit01 Could Dennis O‚ÄôBrien find himself doing time in a Federal prison he wouldn‚Äôt like that, the bribery laws are very serious in the USA üá∫üá∏??
@PekalaLaw @ClwtrBkAtty Probably the Democrats sleepers are behind this round them up deport them
@FuctupMike @JudyMarie4DT The boarder wall will save the nation over $70 billion per year by getting rid of the spongers and the associated expenses
@MaryOGrady8 @jowens00 @AnnetteDonnel11 @IrishTimes Mary you‚Äôre not correct,  you should never take things out of context as it distorts the truth and realty, as part of an abortion there is healthcare for the mother, mental and physical you need to have a little humanity in your words it‚Äôs not a nice thing to have an abortion
@donlav @updayIE Good stuff
@marklevinshow It‚Äôs hard to believe but you are correct to call her dumb would be promotion from where she is now

@PFEW_HQ @PFEW_Chair Sarg I sent you a congrats on receiving that extra funding for the police, thinking it would go into policing and put more police and equipment on the ground, I cannot see why the police should have to pay council tax, they will need to quadruple that they have given you thank U
@rtenews Thank you Catherine you delivered that speech in the Oireachtas with feeling and passion thank you and all the members well done

@ukgeol @PeterStefanovi2 @gmcrotty You give the Labour Party to much credit,J C and co are not capable of level of thinking Napoleon was a brilliant and very capable Leader J C is not, Allen Sugar is a Labour supporter has stated JC is the worst leader Labour ever had, I say JC is a great protester not a leader
@Blessttt @1Davie1 Well done , that‚Äôs the language we like to hear from you someone with a bit of backbone and broad shoulders and yes build the wall, it will save you billions $ look after your own

@ukgeol @PeterStefanovi2 @gmcrotty Well as bad as the Tories at the moment J C and Labour are not even capable of being an opposition they sit there like lost souls, instead of standing and fighting, I don‚Äôt know where this will end,
@KatTheHammer1 I agree I believe Barack Obama is a nice man so be a pastor, you need strong powerful Buisness men and Women to see through the fake news and lies as well as the emotional blackmail used by people to get their way, when you give someone something they didn‚Äôt earn that‚Äôs wrong,
@BobBrinson1 @TinaHoskins11 Absolutely yes true Blue Conservative Do Not know any other way, nothing else works with good leadership, a good General has to take hard and sometimes unpopular decisions to win the battle, it is a mistake to try and please mindless so called do gooders to be popular never works
@PeterStefanovi2 @gmcrotty Rees-Mogg is a foolish person the strongest person in the Conservative party is Theresa May, and well fit for any dizzy comments coming from Jacob Rees-Mogg  who doesn‚Äôt seem to be able realize what‚Äôs going on let alone to predict the mood of the party

@DeepStateExpose @ThinkUPositive1 Surely The police can track these thugs down and lock them up for a very long time, there should be no hiding place and the police should spend what ever it takes to find these cowards, this is what the Democrats are breeding o my god

@KimStrassel @McBride8 An educated man should know the difference between right and wrong,also difference between truth and lies and should also know there are consequences if one does the wrong thing
@marklevinshow @McBride8 The Democrats are disgusting and disgraceful all consumed with hate and negativity, dressed up In lambs clothing for image purposes when in the background they support the criminal caravan, drug dealers, people trafficking, illegal aliens, fake news and god knows what else ????
@PeterMurtagh @WWinters_ Peter if you have a problem with the best friends you have in Europe ie the Irish, you‚Äôre insecure, there is nothing but good will in Ireland for the UK, we have a conservative government working together with other partners to stabilize our economy, likeTheresa May is for you
@RodStryker @TerryGHenderso1 Yes (build the wall deport them all) that should be the chorus of all statements made about the migrants and illegal aliens , and support for President Trump, now the chorus (build the wall deport them all )
@Independent_ie Well done Quick thinking Garda what you did won the day thank you
@mozandy @Clofconnie @dbongino @realDonaldTrump I would agree with that, they have the wrong mindset and you cannot rehabilitate those people with teraphy they are brainwashed, pity
@RebekahWorsham @1Davie1 If that were the case half of the past Presidents would be in the same boat, stop bickering and get on with your life and make your mark on the world with productivity not depravity and your rewards will be greater, be positive smile and the world will smile with you
@MaryOGrady8 @jowens00 @AnnetteDonnel11 @IrishTimes Could you Guys get on with your laves and put our time and energy into  something useful the amendment is over and decided and it will be signed into law , pick a subject like women children been abused in the home, rape, bullying these are things you can do something about üëç

@MaryOGrady8 @jowens00 @AnnetteDonnel11 @IrishTimes I voted yes in the referendum, not for abortion as i would not want any of my family to have an abortion, however I am also a supporter of women‚Äôs equality and writes I voted for a women to chose what she wants for herself, and not to be dictated to by church,state, or men
@Grannyjob @PTorney @AMike4761 I absolutely agree with you
@lovebothireland @MaryOGrady8 @SimonHarrisTD What ever are you talking about there is nothing being railroaded through the Dail  the will of the people is being carried out in accordance with the law that‚Äôs what happens in a democracy, you don‚Äôt have to participate it you so wish
@IrishTimes Bishop the law of the land is the law, and it will be obeyed, religious leaders also must obey the law,
@MaryOGrady8 @AnnetteDonnel11 @IrishTimes Sadly I knew of a well off father of a girl who got pregnant and had a baby, her father paid ¬£900 to the Catholic Church to sweep this under the table, when this lady was dying and in her eighties, was crying where is my baby I wonder what happened to him that‚Äôs so sad not easy
@Gloria_I_Chavez @Clofconnie @CBPElCentro Well done guys nice job a little bit of hard time now for the next lesson
@AnnetteDonnel11 @MaryOGrady8 @IrishTimes Yes I agree the state was run by the Catholic Church who in turn bullied god fearing and brain washed people into doing what they were told yes the state was to blame, but mostly the Catholic Church, to threat those unmarried young mothers and their babies that way, shame on you
@pvtjokerus @Clofconnie Well said friend
@ChuckCallesto Maxine get a life look around you, the criminals support you ever wonder why?
@J_man_chicago What a stupid comment the country is forging ahead who do you think is responsible for that, some visitors the moon üåô

@RorysStories Well done guys üëçüçæ
@Independent_ie That Bishop should be charged with inciting people to break the law, how dare you,
@SimonZebo Simon you have met your match with that little cutie she wins, well done Simon üëçüèâ
@DC_ARVSgt Yes Sarg you get it in one, the only thing these so-called advisors should offer, is moral support and say thank you for the job you do and risk your lives for us every day, and leave policing to the trained experts, the Police thank you üôè
@freedom_moates @ClwtrBkAtty @EmmanuelMacron What ever it takes, what ever the price,  clear the streets protect property, help the police restore law and order,  declare marshal law you cannot allow the rule of law to be broken in this way
@AnnaApp91838450 @1Davie1 @BreitbartNews The agent should have shot the assailant in self defense
@Trump454545 @BoboMarilyn Must disappoint the Democrats, more fake news
@Jenn198523 @1Davie1 That reporter was making matters worse for the police, get off the streets you fool,
@DrMartyFox @1Davie1 The border wall is absolutely needed and patrolled with a heavy hand with no mercy for illegal intruders make those who do wished they didn‚Äôt
@JudicialWatch @1Davie1 Now what Democrats how about that wake up
@RazorPack65 @1Davie1 You were on the street protesting your on camera run away go home when you look for trouble sometimes it will find you
@bbusa617 @1Davie1 Deport them, all they will do is breed more wasters, then you‚Äôre country is doomed, you will have civil war do something now before it‚Äôs to late
@codeofvets @harborgirl21 Your country has a huge responsibility and owes gratitude and respect as well as support to all veterans, you ask them to do a dangerous job, they have done their side now it‚Äôs up to you do yours, a lot of vets look physically okay, a lot are mentally not okay step up duty calls
@ChuckCallesto @ClwtrBkAtty I wish people would get on with their lives for once, and try to mend   fences across the board, instead of looking for the bad in each other to score tricks, people voted for you work for their good, and improve lives, please respect each other‚Äôs views work together, for the USA
@Raguleader @charliekirk11 @jonhsanders2 No but the living person who used their vote would need to be worried
@Independent_ie Well minister you have the power to do something about this injustice you replace the person who made this decision as they are not fit for purpose, is this not unfair dismissal? Is it legal?
@bbusa617 @jonhsanders2 More corruption expose all this corruption, publish and televise it with the same aggression as the Democrats do with their fake news making sure you be truthful and accurate, that will hurt and they will loose all credibility
@charliekirk11 @jonhsanders2 America needs to investigate voter fraud the most powerful country in the world has to be able to put a system in place to track these dead voters and prosecute those who do so with stiff prison time it will make people think twice,
@Independent_ie There is something seriously wrong with RTE if they are not renewing Martina Fitzgerald‚Äôs contract, it needs to be investigated who made the decision and why, is there a hidden agenda if so root it out and expose the villain, Martina does a great job we need answers
@Education4Libs @SusanHa58439616 Put them high security prison that has a chain gang, then put them building the wall for a couple of years then deport them I believe you have to get the organization trafficking these migrants, before it‚Äôs to late
@kimusastrong @donnia8789 Shame on them I mean the UN
@The_Trump_Train @relaxnpensacol1 Yes good idea bring it on ASAP
@DC_ARVSgt @ProtectRPolice Yes Sarg you have to let your superior mind make allowances for the political mind,as it often said politics is the last refuge of a scoundrels, you on the other hand have to take all these deficiencies into account good luck stay safe
@punkpuffin @bagofcows @alexgordon4me @blackyellowbrd @UKLabour @jeremycorbyn I also live 40% in UK and have contributed to the UK economy for 40 odd years and still do, my MP advised me to vote as I did, he majority in the UK voted as I did
@DC_ARVSgt @ProtectRPolice Politics stay out of policing, legislate then leave it to the police to enforce the law their way, as they are the experts, supply the police with their needs, ie safety attire, transport, equipment, and moral support good luck Guys
@PSNIBelfastW Some sickness in a uninformed idiot that should be in a mental hospital with nothing going on in this culprit life poor things, it‚Äôs all they could attack the dead, the cowards could not face one of those war dead alive, love to apprehend them and put their photos all over media
@bagofcows @alexgordon4me @blackyellowbrd @UKLabour @jeremycorbyn Richard I hope you are correct, In that case Ireland should leave as well and alli with the UK
@JOEdotie And so say all of us,  the HSE cannot be fixed
@spin1038 Well done Garda fantastic news
@bagofcows @alexgordon4me @blackyellowbrd @UKLabour @jeremycorbyn I agree,  so the UK should be sitting strongly at the top table steading and steering the ship instead of running away and allowing the others to do as they wish, although I live in Ireland I have a vote the UK (I voted for Brexit) I did not have the facts as it‚Äôs turned out
@alexgordon4me @blackyellowbrd @UKLabour @jeremycorbyn It has always been a socialist Europe that‚Äôs the problem can he not see it‚Äôs changing they are all turning right what papers are you reading man
@OregonJOBS2 I would have to say bad parenting there are ways of dealing with this problem, and not creating another making her walk 5 miles to school is also a form of bullying so you are teaching her bullying works, instead teach her how to respect,conduct, and communicate with others üëç
@JOEdotie This lady proves my point that the political establishment in the UK has lost it‚Äôs way, with wild statements like hers, food shortages in Ireland we are huge exporters of food billions of euro per year because of our high standards, she also forgets we are staying in The EU
@blackyellowbrd You can put on what ever color vest you wish,if you do not have political leadership fit for purpose you will not succeed, at present the Labour Party is almost non existent no backbone or leadership Jeremy C. What is the matter with you man, if you have a medical problem say so
@OrgPhysics @patrick_emmet That‚Äôs what started these stories and myths in olden times
@Independent_ie The problem with this dispute is one saw himself as the looser and over time kept building up to an explosion which is what happened, one should be aware of ones actions on others in this case you have two families destroyed,  there are no winners, all losers
@DermotCosgrove Another vixen will fed in very good condition
@Ana21066852 @Clofconnie Fantastic to see what you did Rodney your the kind of people we need more of in the world today not asking what others can do for you but what we can do for others Bless you and your family Rodney thank you üëç

@Independent_ie Good to see you looking so good Peter with that good looking girl on your arm, good luck üëç
@ZonePhysics @EoinBearla I did that years ago in Finland however I could never pick it up it always broke with the slit est touch
@LybergIngrid @colettebrowne That‚Äôs outrageous when you see figures like that put before you,one never realized the extent of the problem, I get slammed sometimes for being a supporter of women‚Äôs rights and equality, it is all about respect and equality I said only look down on someone to admire their shoes
@JOEdotie What a clever women who stated  she would not welcome  UK into their block as she stated the UK would mess things up for them,the way they messed things for themselves in the UK, what is needed is a practical political leader to lead the country and stop listening to the clowns
@IWiIlkaga All of the liberals propaganda will come back to haunt them, they will loose all credibility when the truth is revealed, if you listen and believe what they say and it turns out false you have contributed to the problem be careful what you wish for
@zerohedge @IWiIlkaga Please stop trying to provoke people sit down and talk, diplomacy is the best policy, it will end up there anyway, so why not start there saving a lot of waste and time, make better friends with less adverse to overcome in future, like my mom said little said is easily to mended
@JohnSimpsonNews John absolutely correct some people will never learn, don‚Äôt have that ability sadly, they have a lack of education more importantly a lack of respect for their fellow man, if one does not have respect for others, you do not earn respect, the Plutocracy and Plebs  are long gone
@DermotCosgrove Was she invited? looks like a vixen
@donlav Yes Don a lot of people sometimes forget about the sacrifices that the Russians made in WW11 lost lives whole families wiped out they are worthy of remembrance thank you
@JebBush @USNavy @flynavy Fair play to the US Navy you never forget your own, great respect from fellow aviators, and also a time to remember George‚Äôs eight fellow aviators who lost their lives on that mission and never returned praise the lord for their sacrifice and lives may they rest in piece amen üôè
@thejournal_ie Yes Leo it‚Äôs been out of step for a long time, the people in the front line nurses doctors will do their job and do it well, unfortunately there are other people in the health service the HSE who are not fit for purpose who see themselves as more important than the Medics, ? P45
@NewstalkFM Well said I agree think about the women and their lives and respect their wishes that is what we voted for and not for these fee loaders who are trying to make a name for themselves respect a women‚Äôs right to make her own decisions
@IWiIlkaga @RockyRidgesPal Don‚Äôt be stupid, some people will say anything I often wonder what they use for brains sadly they don‚Äôt have any
@SkyNews @IWiIlkaga School children as you call them ?, look like teenagers can also be rioters if they were at home they would not have this problem
@SarahPalinUSA @IWiIlkaga She is a criminal and she proved that fact herself
@charliekirk11 @ThinkUPositive1 That‚Äôs why they are Known as the spongers party Take Take Take give ?? Nothing, that‚Äôs why they want the Mexico Caravan migrants, more spongers to swell their number, get out and work earn a living,  USA be on alert watch out for trouble from the left

@thejournal_ie Now step up and help your Garda when you want the Garda their ready to help you now you help the Garda that‚Äôs the decent thing to do
@RTErugby Two fantastic people and two fantastic rugby players good luck guys keep up the great work that keeps us smiling you did it all you did it your way thank you üòä
@AmoneyResists @FoxNews @TomiLahren You are correct if they are allowed in more will come, do not allow any of these migrants in, you will have untold problems in future, they are not law abiding people,these people are not refugees they have admitted so they are looking for work and handouts like healthcare,cop on

@DubFireBrigade Thank you
@IrishTimesBiz I was a great friend to An Tasice for a great number of years I believe it has lost its way, interfering in house, and other planning for no legitimate reason, it has been taken over by fanatics that do nothing except add cost to projects it unlike the The National Trust in UK
@DubFireBrigade Visiting some weeks ago and I saw what looked like two fire alarms on their living room ceiling i mentioned the idea of having two fire alarms, o no one is a carbon monoxide alarm I informed her the carbon monoxide alarm should be close to the floor, answer my god we didn‚Äôt know

@Independent_ie President Trump was correct these migrants are trouble, they do not respect the rule of law, they put their women and children in the path of danger to achieve their goals, to invade the USA using the humanity ticket, protect your country from future problems keep them out
@Independent_ie Should have been 10 years your victim gets life remembering you sick animal piece of nothing

@Independent_ie Well done Judge and Jury now you‚Äôre getting it right many thanks
@CallMeFebel @RepBarbaraLee @DebbieGT18 @UN I believe your country is your home and needs to be protected in lots of ways, pollution, law and order, invasion, needs of the citizens, healthcare, education, in a democracy you are policed and governed by Consent to protect all this, if this fails you have anarchy get my point
@bennyjohnson That Guy Jim Acosta is a disgrace to journalism he has only one thing on his mind not right or wrong it‚Äôs President Trump, the criminals from South America don‚Äôt bother him so long as he can twist the news to his advantage he is not interested in the rule of law, a fantastic?
@RepBarbaraLee @DebbieGT18 @UN If a criminal is trying to break into your home you will shut the gate or door and call the police, in this case the people who rushed the border post got teargas thrown at them by law inforcement protecting themselves from these criminals I would hate to have you in security
@MikeLevinCA @msmadscientist7 Try not sensualize a situation for your own selfish reason, dramatics is for Hollywood if you have something to sell spell it out

@thejournal_ie That‚Äôs what the border agents have to do protect their borders from undesirables,  as these people have proven they are ready to break the law and invade your country think what they would do if they got in invade your homes ?
@Independent_ie The Garda Commissioner and the Garda do their job it‚Äôs the Courts that has to do theirs better, a rapist should NOT get a suspended sentence weather he pleads guilty or not he may plead guilty to get a reduced sentence, prison that sends a message to the would be rapist yes Judge
@RebekahWorsham The USA has no alternative but to protect itself from invasion from where ever it comes where these people come from they do not respect the rule of law, they have to be stopped stay in Mexico you are already there, I believe they are trouble makers as they have already proved
@JohnnySexton Johnny there is no need to be speechless you deserve everything you are getting your are a hero thank you üôè
@Ukusaaus @amber_athey President Trump stated that the caravan had criminal elements and undesirables traveling in convoy the goody two shoes got all fired up about humanity and the law, the law is only afforded to law abiding people, these people clearly are not, do not create a problem for the future
@amber_athey @Ukusaaus Who the hell do they think they are that‚Äôs an attack on the USA an attempted invasion what do they expect it proved one thing they are not law abiding people maybe Trump was right
@farrahsafiakhan @JMGayton1 Don‚Äôt be stupid let them get asylum in the first country they arrive in that is the law and they have no right to cross another country to get asylum in less you are saying Mexico is not safe?
@VinaigretteGirl @DanKaszeta What kind of mother would expose her children to this they rushed border of another country waving a foreign flag and then look for sympathy they‚Äôre in Mexico get asylum there the USA didn‚Äôt want them this caravan is a form of bullying if you cannot negotiate your way go back
@RTErugby @rtenews Sorry to loose you Joe your the best welcome on board Andy and good luck
@SeanOReganIRL @donlav You are correct the people who abuse women are nothings they are so insignificant in the world all they can do is bully because they are unable to stand up to stronger people well there should be no hiding place for them in law or elsewhere expose and jail them and-shun them

@rte @RTEdoconone Please respect the rule of law I am not making Judgment on what they did or did not do a Jury of their piers found them not guilty an honorable Judge stated they were free to go, I am a strong supporter of women‚Äôs rights and have nothing but contempt for rapist, respect the law

@dontbrexitfixit @theresa_may Thank you Theresa May with your stance on Gibraltar üá¨üáÆI go there a lot
@IrishTimes Yes President  Micheal D Higgins I agree no matter where it is at home or in far away countries it needs to be tackled some sick people think they have a right to to abuse women and girls and treat them as less important than men we should use trade sanctions to protect women

@IrishTimes The way a girl is dressed no matter how desirable sexually attractive she is if that makes her feel good well done girls, that‚Äôs nothing to do with rape, a rapist is a sick sycophantic abusive criminal and sexual thief there should be no hiding place for them in law or elsewhere
@DanRather @msmadscientist7 Did you know gardeners of old nurtured ladybirds as they controlled  green fly and other garden insects üêû
@rtenews I don‚Äôt know what the Spanish are complaining about the Spanish controls two parts of Morocco namely Melilla and Ceuta do they want to give these territories up I don‚Äôt believe so the residents of Gibraltar want to stay as they are, after all its only a rock 3 miles by 2

@rtenews Trump it is an invasion they‚Äôre in Mexico let them get asylum in Mexico and Trump should close the border it is crazy to allow those people to impose their will on another country Mexico allowed them in now look after them you have to protect your borders
@donlav Yes you guys the crew of the William B Yates you all look great, good luck and stay safe happy sailing
@PFEW_HQ @PFEW_Chair I absolutely agree with you, you need to increase police numbers greatly also you need to have very stiff penalties ie prison and fines and any disrespectful behavior towards a police on duty needs to be addressed before it‚Äôs two late the government needs to act now
@NewstalkFM That‚Äôs the stuff you need to dish out to thugs now arrest them and charge them üôè
@Independent_ie What an idiot you want someone to pay for your stupidity get a life
@charlottehelenb @gmcrotty It will never happen something always comes up to fix a problem when it arrives that is the way of the world üåé
@NiamhoNiamh @rte I could listen to Professor Brian Cox for ever he has a unique way of explaining his knowledge and making one listen and observe its a gift also watched him on his tv programs/documentaries well done üëç
@Antcon7062 @gmcrotty If the Kerry GAA had an ounce of sense that player/member should be drummed out of the organization what a role model thug to have in their team I believe the DPP should appeal that decision he should go to prison, it sends a wrong message to people who assaults a Garda
@IrishTimes He should have got and served the four years a coward will always be a coward
@MichealMartinTD This vandalism was done by some one without a single brain cell it‚Äôs disgusting our fellow citizens who died an that mad war and now some idiot disrespecting their memory and sacrifice shame on you who ever you are

@Independent_ie That sentence in my opinion is not good enough I believe once a tug always a tug do not blame the drink it only releases what‚Äôs in him, it sends a wrong message to others if you assault a Garda on duty you should go to prison being a GAA player or wholly joe doesn‚Äôt wash with me
@UlsterRugby @RoryBest2 Lovely to see you three, Rory you fully deserve your OBE and you are the most successful Irish rugby captain and a great Ulster Man, we beat the all-blacks wow, we are very proud of you and the guys, you are an absolute gentleman it was nice to see the family in Landsdowne road

@OnePoliceUK They should get at least 5 years in prison pressure needs to be put on the CPS to come down hard on these thugs if you don‚Äôt you will have problems good luck
@Zara_brown790 I remember in Ireland if a Garda was assaulted in the course of their duty the perpetrator got an automatic prison sentence that needs to come back the courts need to hand down stiffer custodial sentences for assaults on police officers instead a judge saying don‚Äôt do that again

@Channel4News Gordon Brown is making sense
@IrishTimesOpEd Jeremy Corbyn capability‚Äôs doesn‚Äôt extend that far there is effectively no opposition in the house at this time when ever he does speak it contributes nothing to the debate and causes even more confusion he looks as he would rather be somewhere else??

@TheLooseH Nice one üëçüèâ
@Independent_ie Joe the reason why the head of the HSE or a Bishop well not come on is they would not be able to answer your questions like Tony OBrian all he could do is, like a bold child, O it wasn‚Äôt me and blame someone else the same with the Bishop some fairytale answer with no logic
@Independent_ie Long over due it‚Äôs about time people woke up to these crazy payouts like the Luas ‚Ç¨500k for someone committing an offense there should be no more payouts for anyone hurt doing something illegal people should be held responsible for their own actions instead of rewarding them ??

@IrishTimesOpEd The Catholic Church can never escape from sex and abuse scandals they would like the media to stay quiet and not expose them so they could carry on in their wicked ways the median as a responsibility to expose the abuse no more if there are clergy like that go work in a Sex club

@NewstalkFM It‚Äôs sad to see Tony OBrian casting aspersions on. others when he was the one the minister should have to rely on browsed ego
@timmydooley Anything Peter Casey says can only be put down to the ramblings of an escaped mental hospital inmate he was totally lost on the late late show and it was cruelty for Ryan T to expose the poor thing to big questions which he did not understand or answer
@Martin44152 @BigDunc123 They are just ordinary phones if they need security they use incepted phones it‚Äôs not a Masonic Lodge or a secret society it‚Äôs a police force
@anonjohn3 @BigDunc123 Yes they do
@NewstalkFM If it were your family who was eatin alive how would you feel once a tiger gets a taste for human flesh they will hunt humans
@cooper_m The no. 10 did well the big no 20 got a shock
@Independent_ie Dirty old Bastard when one thinks of those unfortunate girls and then look at brood of viper it‚Äôs hard not to loose it, what ever jail time he got I hope it‚Äôs hard
@IrishTimesOpEd I wonder how Peter Casey feel if the travelers targeted Him and his Buisness
@rtenews What a clown ü§° this man Peter Casey suffers from the worst case of megalomania I have ever seen the expression on his face tells all his poor wife must be mortified
@IrishTimesOpEd @IrishTimes @fotoole Fintan the people of Gibraltar want to stay as they are

@SimonHarrisTD Simon it‚Äôs very easy to listen to someone who makes sense of the world at large Mary R was the first of a bunch of very strong women who shaped and molded our society as said if one keeps talking your repeating what you already know if you listen you may learn something good luck
@anonjohn3 @BigDunc123 It happens all the time there banks of phones a member will take a phone and sign it out and by the way do you think the Garda commissioner six phones ? Because there are six phones misplaced cop on
@IrishTimes It‚Äôs not long enough
@Philip_Ryan @CormacMcQuinn No they would not the Catholic Church in Ireland is in the final stages of meltdown or are you looking at the history channel the Church in Finglas that accommodated 3000 is been demolished and replaced with one to accommodate 359 and population on the area has doubled??
@kenfoxe Stop looking for soft targets it‚Äôs a form of bullying and no one cares
@IrishTimes Thank you Richard
@skydavidblevins Mary to me your likened to an icebreaker in the frozen north you opened so many pathways  for so many people in so many ways under difficult conditions with Church and state locked in bygone ways and ideology you are a hero and we are very proud of you bless you
@donlav Well done üëç
@niallemcmahon @BigDunc123 That was my point, so when some miss informed space cadet spreads misinformation on social media it has to be addressed otherwise people will start believing it, but then you do have to be equipped with the brains to logically annualize it, unfortunately not all had that gift
@donlav I agree I also believe there should be a mandatory psychiatric test for people like those to see if they are fit to serve as a TD democracy has spoken stop trying to get cheap publicity typical of a small town political figure get on and do your job if you are able ??
@BigDunc123 Noirin O‚ÄôSullivan did not misplace the phones they got lost in the organization as lots of people use those phones and the information that was and is on those phones is available laptops are also used by lots it different members that information is also available so cop on
@Independent_ie What a laugh
@TimesofIsrael @donlav Anti inoculation protesters take note
@thejournal_ie Mary you changed the President of  Ireland‚Äôs image for ever for the good many thanks
@Independent_ie Thank god Fool
@Colmogorman @donlav Will someone get real the reason for the low turnout was majellen laundry, mother &amp;baby homes, child sex abuse by priests, exploitation of unmarried mothers, the Catholic Church was responsible for the low turnout rate should be complemented for highlighting the scandals - shame
@IvanYatesNT Ivan you are howell still a teenager at heart long may Last cheers
@IrishTimesOpEd I agree with Stephen Collins the media have a huge responsibility when I comes to what they publish Peter Casey in particular used the media to publish and embellish untruthful comments in it‚Äôs raw state which became almost real that‚Äôs the responsibility of the media researchers
@thejournal_ie Yes for two reasons one they would be on hand with no other distractions two they would free up the already over stretched Garda however they would have to be under the control of and answerable to Garda√≠
@AFSpecOpsCmd Was it fat Albert?
@HangBlaa John, Tommy Cooper is not dead just like that we laughed at him as well and he hadn‚Äôt even started
@DesmondNora @Independent_ie I always when you don‚Äôt agree with facts you will say the author is been ridiculous or some such words, I did not say anything about Catholic mass goers, I said people who are indoctrinated with non factual religious beliefs they create fear in people,they are vulnerable fact
@IrishTimesWorld Well done President Donald Trump you‚Äôre hitting the right notes
@HangBlaa Nice one John you may not know but you could have a career as a comedian
@thejournal_ie President Trump is absolutely 100% correct in taking the action he is taking more leaders need to take this action turn them back to their own country
@PeterMurtagh I could not agree more in my mind Maurice is a hero and a good man

@thejournal_ie Good luck and have a happy retirement your look there is plenty of life left in you i am sure you will have plenty to keep your busy üëç
@DesmondNora @Independent_ie Anywhere that vulnerable people are exploited because of their beliefs and faith is of concern to all humanity and fair minded people it is a form of bullying no more hiding for the Catholic Church why should non catholic taxpayers have to pay for the Pope visiting Ireland? ??
@thejournal_ie He is absolutely correct
@campaignforleo @RTENewsNow Badly needed good stuff one for landings one for takeoff makes things safer and quicker cheers ü•Ç
@Channel4News Doctor you are a hero you are what humanity is all about it is heart worming to see that there are people like you in the world what a wonderful person you are and what a wonderful world it would be filled like you, you did not Judge him you praised the cops well done üëç
@Independent_ie What a foolish man he misinterpreted the vote I do not believe he has the ability to understand why or for what reason he got these votes we do not need divisions in our country we are doing well enough without foreigners Peter Casey trying to cause trouble where he contributed O
@IrishTimes They don‚Äôt have to drive home if they are over the limit
@IrishTimesOpEd Ireland has never cared about blasphemy as we never had a conviction

@joethejoiner @rtenews You don‚Äôt know him that‚Äôs what he‚Äôs doing all his life
@Somerandomsham1 @rtenews Like that üëç
@rtenews There is no place for him anywhere
@Independent_ie The people of Ireland do not want you,further do not take a protest vote as a vote for government if you do you are suffering from lack of imagination and harboring allusions of The 3rd demented zombie zone there are people who can help you if they get to you in time , call
@IrishTimesPol This time Micheal D has a mandate from the people of Ireland to be their President and Shriek I mean Casey can say that he likes one cannot argue with that landslide victory bless Micheal D good luck thank you
@OSilvergun @historylvrsclub Cad many thanks
@OSilvergun @historylvrsclub Thanks for that I didn‚Äôt know which one it was Teddy or Theodore that was associated with the Bull Moose Party I know that Teddy was one of the rough riders at the time he was an army officer
@NChildersMEP Nessa I am the same I voted for Micheal D I like his ability and attitude and his well mannered approach to all, the others we‚Äôre interested in what they they could get out of the Presidents position for themselves Micheal D is interested in the people, I am a FG supporter üëç
@Independent_ie I only put one vote on the card Michael D on the guideline of My party Fine Gael
@RugbyPlayersIRE @TommyBowe14 @louisludik Tommy you‚Äôre looking to fit to be retired cheers mate
@historylvrsclub Is that the reason Teddy‚Äôs first political party was known as the Bull Moose party seeing he‚Äôs on a Moose crossing the river
@kierancuddihy Your absolutely correct if you call that fame ?
@DubFireBrigade Will done girls and guys thanks üôè
@No41Association @41RTES Remembering my fallen family heroes to young to die RIP
@JOEdotie He jumped the Stardust gun as they have asked him to stay away from their march and they did not ask him represent them, dishonest, stupidity, imaginations, megalomania can he not find a hiding place
@HangBlaa You are probably correct what the ordinary people in UK don‚Äôt realize how educated we are in Ireland our parents worked hard to educate us comparing to the UK we have over ten times their rate of third level educated people and as you know knowledge is power, the brain drain
@HangBlaa John they do a conservative MP spoke out a couple of weeks ago about the vacuum in politics in UK stated that they should look at Ireland‚Äôs government and how the parties are working together achieving almost full employment and the best growth in Europe paid the banks debt üëç
@radiokerrynews @MOReganIT Shame on you most other co co,s are trying to distance themselves from the nomination did you not read the news he is the most dishonest person in the race
@HangBlaa And they seem to think we are doing better than they are and we had to start from scratch when the British left Ireland they took all the money the government or the day had to send messengers to all the county councils to collect money to pay government expenses
@IrishTimesSport Yes Micheal I new a man who retired on Friday and turned up for work on Monday as usual the boss let him do little bits to keep him happy he sounds like he is still canvassing and no one is listening Not FG Not FF Not LAB O where O where is my Mona O where O where can she be ?
@SiCarswell That‚Äôs it he is a well educated man who cares for people he knows how to conduct himself he loves this country and it‚Äôs people unlike the thugs who were running against him l think they are all sharing the same brain except when Casey has it, it seems to malfunction poor things
@IrishTimesPol When is Sean Gallagher going to realize he is not wanted people are asking who is he what does he do another answered that‚Äôs the lad who sued rte and cost the Irish tax payer over ‚Ç¨400k between compensation and costs and then he has the Gaul to ask about expenses of President ?
@IrishTimes Sounds about right the last refuge of a scoundrel
@Independent_ie Miriam the race would have been a lot different had you been in it you know what your talking about you‚Äôre well versed and knowledgeable on all aspects of life and your psychology and philosophy you would win your also a very beautiful lady that would also bring glamour as well
@MiriamOCal Miriam Micheal is a nice guy but after the program interview you may need a brain scan
@thejournal_ie Absolutely not it‚Äôs a cost we do not need Seven years just fine
@oconnellhugh @ger_oconnor Do not mind what Peter Casey says he keeps throwing out wild statements with no substance or accuracy in the hope that some less intelligent people may believe what like the plutocrats of old the plebes believed, the dinosaurs are gone, so is Casey type politics, no plebes here
@rtenews You are not wanted don‚Äôt you understand?
@colettebrowne @rtenews Well said it shows the foolish nature of the man I described him as a member of the self admiration society and he proves it every time he opens his mouth
@IrishTimes Peter Casey doesn‚Äôt realize we got rid of his type of corrupt politics together with corruption in the Catholic Church we are not going to lapse back there we worked to hard to get where we are to let a foolish person like him ruin it he thinks this is some type of game show
@MRSC16 Rory you will not sleep tonight what a kick people lost their voices at the moment that ball üèà went between the post you are a cracker the pressure must have been massive cheers üçª
@SeanDefoe @NewstalkFM Why would he did Casey apologies to Leo our Taoiseach show a bit of respect
@CillianHennessy @rtenews I agree some things the travelers do are inexcusable let society try and change that
@rtenews It was all about the travelers as it was the only thing he talked about
@IrishTimes This is an even bigger clown than I thought
@IrishTimes It was you and if you keep on lying to your self you need help
@colettebrowne I don‚Äôt understand why you are surprised FG voters supported Micheal D I am FG supporter I am a conservative right wing Protestant who believes in fairness good manners and humanity for all, he got the others because there was no one else to vote for
@caelivd @RossOCK @AkaPaulHoward You will be eight by then and no party would take u on you are u unelectable I have two friends who voted for you and they stated we didn‚Äôt want him to win and they new you wouldn‚Äôt that is why they did it we had people like you in politics in this country for years no more bye
@Independent_ie Still a donkeys as a neighbor remarked ,  who are you talking about said another Casey he answered what Casey he asked, the lad running for President, o that asshole he replied, to which another replied and what ass would want that for a hole , a round of laughter not nice lads
@thejournal_ie That‚Äôs a poll I like, Leo and company are in touch with the people they‚Äôre open and listening to all when it came to scolding the Pope about abuse of unmarried mothers and their babies üë∂ something that would never happen in the past, abortion, weeding out corruption  Fine Gael
@NewstalkFM Micheal D has devoted his life to the people of Ireland as a learn-it professor in Galway university where the he students speak highly and fondly of him, the likes Gallagher,Casey‚Äô and others had no chance it is a failure on their part to think they could unseat him with zero
@fotoole Yes Fintan I agree and it will add to their credit Casey‚Äôs on the other hand got none, had the others contracted on issues other than attending to undermine the office of the President and the president himself they would have done better they may have learned a lesson maybe?
@thejournal_ie Micheal D hasn‚Äôt left it‚Äôs his home for the next seven years üëçüçæ by that time Casey will be 80 he said he would only be able to do five years not much energy in him
@GardaTraffic Well done Garda that‚Äôs the way do it keep up the good work be polite do your job Drew Harris will back you
@CillianHennessy @rtenews You misinterpret my idea of thugs he made controversial comments about travelers and people receiving welfare your interpretation is they are  thugs, Issac Newton‚Äôs third law of relativity is Karma if you are we‚Äôll of you don‚Äôt use it to attack the less well of, that‚Äôs a thug
@UlsterRugby Yes yes guys well done on form great staff fantastic results üëç
@Independent_ie It doesn‚Äôt say much for us to give that clown ü§° a vote when he preying in vulnerable peoples lives leaving the travelers out of it and attacking the only decent man in the race shame on him as he is over seventy he won‚Äôt be around for the next time in seven years thank god
@UlsterRugby Good stuff guys
@Jim_Sheridan @donlav I agree when you reign or try to reign with out humanity and care and prey on vulnerable people Karma will catch you it may take a while but it will come like a thief in the night and then they lose all, you cannot rule by fear or being a bully someone will be waiting to get you
@HangBlaa @donlav John it would be fantastic if we could however the state itself participated in this awful tragedy with the Catholic Church and unfortunately it is all statute barred now and most of the culprits are dead but their wares are still there let‚Äôs convert them to housing ect.
@FlightIrish @donlav Nice to see the chippies  In the air the old gypsies purring well Pierce Cahall and CPT Darby Kennedy would love to see them flying it would be nice to rewind a little and press pause just for a little bit fare well old friends
@rtenews Casey probably had the Tugs voting for him I hope we have learned our lesson find another way to pick the President and keep foolish candidates of the ballots paper we don‚Äôt need stupidity and self admiration people bringing the shame on the presidents office Gallagher and Casey
@IrishTimes Congrats Mr President that exist poll gives me a good feeling I hope it does the same for you praise the lord for Professor Michael D Higgins President of Ireland üáÆüá™ we are proud of you for your creditable good mannered approach and dignity you bring to your office thank you üôè
@campaignforleo @FineGael @CharlieFlanagan @josephamadigan @ReginaDo @SimonHarrisTD @simoncoveney @HHumphreysFG @MichaelDHiggins @HMcEntee @MurphyEoghan Yes we will vote for Micheal D the only decent person in the race Casey and Gallagher would love to be Micheal D poor things, I heard they sit in the darkness repeating I want to be President please god let me President I will not put any more plastic in the lake I will be good
@kwilli1046 @JJRyan64 Good man we need more like you well done
@grahamjsimmons @jamieheaslip Well said do not mess with the Lions it has lasted longer and gave more than most keep the red caps coming
@rtenews Good on you Leo, just like Brian O‚ÄôDriscoll‚Äôs Shoulder to Shoulder documentary it is good to see the other side how else can one arrive at a conclusion, you always have in every equation three sides your side their side and harmony is somewhere in the middle, respect is the key
@IrishRugby @KEITHEARLS87 @Munsterrugby We proud of you man well done Keith your the man
@Colmogorman Pater Casey thinks Donegal is part of Northern Ireland he drives plastic balls into lakes, he thinks the people of Ireland are sponges, he doesn‚Äôt believe in the welfare state, I do not believe we have ever had as ugly a person as him in a Presidential race what a creepy guy
@JamesMelville @donlav Well said Lord Allen Sugar any chance of getting you as prim minster now we‚Äôre talking?
@IrishTimes Good six years is not enough it should be life sicko bastard
@IrishTimes Sean Gallagher is the laughingstock of the country‚Äôs normal people the only thing people seem to know about him is he sued Rte what he does or did in public life no one I ask seems to know as I said a member of the self admiration society and mentality impaired guild of same
@Independent_ie It makes a joke of the Presidential candidates talking about Michael Ds supposed to be expensive life style against the Pope 20 million cost to the taxpayers how many houses would we build with 20mil ? =800 where is Dumb and Dumber Gallagher &amp; Casey now Catholic Church it time ??
@thejournal_ie And rightly so nothing short of blatant fraud get the contact, cut corners,take the money, get out of town joe public will as usual carry the burden , people in charge of awarding contacts to contractors have a responsibility to insure the rules of procurement followed
@re_keogh @thejournal_ie Definitely Ivan won they looked and sounded lost when questioned by Ivan especially Casey and Gallagher could you imagine two people of their low intelligence representing our country if elected god forbid, would need full time care from the diplomatic staff what a nightmare
@MiriamOCal @TomClonan @Downsyndromecen @Therese Good stuff Miriam you should have been a Presidential candidate you could have given those Dragons a thing or two they would have been running for cover
@irishkeith09 @donlav @MetAlertIreland @IrelandAMVMT @PictureIreland @ancienteastIRL @TourismIreland @StormHour @barrabest @DiscoverIreland We are old
@Independent_ie Where was Gallagher for the last 7 years was he unemployed dose he need a job what dose he do he looks at you with that asinine grin on his face and trying to string a few words together that makes no sense he does better suing Rte maybe that‚Äôs he‚Äôs been living on for 7 years ?
@rtenews Good stuff and good luck to you and your wife and family thank you üôè
@JOEdotie You need not worry you are unelectable so you can go back to whatever country you come from you are not an Irish man
@donlav @MichaelDHiggins Don it‚Äôs a breath of fresh with a man of your knowledge spells it out in that way Micheal D has spent his life serving the community and fighting for justice and equality and when you get a bunch of rascals like Gallagher and Casey attacking him when they have no credibility
@IrishTimes @harrymcgee Peter Casey has destroyed the Presidential campaign for all the others with his outrageous ugly and bad mannered rants I don‚Äôt even believe he is an Irish man who wants ugly peoples these days he has the face of a lunatic with no idea what he is talking about god help us co co ?
@Independent_ie This long over due the State and the inhumanity of the Catholic Church knows no bounds all babies want is to be loved and cared for it is the basic rules of humanity and with that care and love we create people who grow up as decent loving people karma will catch with you see ?
@IrishTimes This should be a garden of remembrance to those babies and to bring it home to all of us the wrongs of the state and Catholic Church who made a living out of this if you have a heart looking at your babies and then think you would feel if someone did this to your baby shame on U
@rtenews Does Sean Gallagher not realize how disliked he is or how on earth he could ever be president of this country he is a nothing why would he even run I have asked people what they thought of the candidates they describe Casey and Gallagher as sleazy hate figures?
@IrishTimesOpEd @IrishTimes Let us keep it that way with Michael D
@thejournal_ie What I cannot understand is have these fools running for the Presidency not come up with any ideas other than attacking the President doesn‚Äôt he realize that he is spoiling the election for his running mates he doesn‚Äôt care da da
@LovinDublin I believe Peter Casey should be prosecuted for his insulting and defamation of character statements, ugly should be his middle name what a creepy guy, I‚Äôd say he goes home at night and crying üò≠ himself to sleep he keeps whispering Micheal D Micheal D please help me it‚Äôs not me
@thejournal_ie Sean Gallagher you are a lost cause you would make a good protester like my dog chases cars when he catches the car he can‚Äôt even drive i am afraid you will have to wait for lesser opposition to make any headway you‚Äôre doing your self no good just like Casey
@rtenews You are not doing your self any good with that line of questions you are only opening yourself to more damaging questions I asked you to think positive, been positive doesn‚Äôt mean things will turn out the way you want it means you will be ok no matter what way goes
@Independent_ie It‚Äôs hard to believe that there are clowns like Peter Casey in our country their mindset is from a bygone age how could anyone take advice on any aspect of life from him unless you want to create unrest and ill feelings it is people like him who start wars and civil unrest
@senatornoone Marc McSherry should loose his seat over his stance on abortion what a clown FF I ask you
@Independent_ie There‚Äôs something very cynical that we  have started to ask questions about the Presidents expense we are a very well to do country The least we can do is show off a little it is also cynical that comes from a bunch of pretentious clowns ie the self admiration society
@maryroche That‚Äôs nice to think about your dad in that way Mary they could be strolling on a strand in a faraway land the beautiful home of the sole , cheers
@MarieTBrady @TheRadioOfficer @thejournal_ie If Miriam  O,Callaghan had gone forward as a candidate she would not have been tethered at the starting gate it‚Äôs all about creditably good manners and decency with a fairness attitude and how to present oneself
@TheRadioOfficer @MarieTBrady @thejournal_ie I agree however when one is 3/4 way down the track even a poor old donkey would win, not that I am referring to anyone in the race is a donkey, however feel free yourself I prefer to think kindly
@MarieTBrady @TheRadioOfficer @thejournal_ie The latest opinion polls revile 7 out of 10 will vote for Micheal D that makes me happy mostly because the other candidates ie Casey, Gallagher, Duffey are so inept and so out of touch with the people‚Äôs views on them or the idea that anybody would vote them, so disillusioned
@UlsterRugby @KingspanStadium Never mind guys
@LiadhNiRiadaMEP @donlav For gods sake think of something positive to say to advance your position forget about protest politics it  never works take a leaf out of your late Dads book a very nice gentleman with only good things to say about people who was loved by all who new him good luck üçÄ
@thejournal_ie Micheal D or any President does not arrange his or her travel or plans he is told what they have arranged he simply goes along with the arrangements as others look after security extremely important
@Independent_ie Thank you for that insight into the complexities of the traveler v the settled community The likes of Peter Casey doesn‚Äôt have the brain power or training to deal with political issues he comes over as a man making things up as he goes along does he not realize it won‚Äôt work
@IrishTimesCultr @IrishTimes Well one lunatic to another at least Trump has turned the USA economy around best growth in 12 years maybe Peter Casey was in hope if he won the Presidency he might meet Trump and hope to exchange stories
@donlav Sitting on the fence as usual as he was when the referendum campaign was held it seems he cannot lead he is more of a protester than leader
@Csorensenbp @BrianODriscoll Brian we wouldn‚Äôt have expected anything less from you it‚Äôs a great documentary and very wide in appeal and attributes of our sport Rugby and its unifying achievement over the years it did not matter where we played the clubs in the north or south we were Rugby players IRFU üëç
@thejournal_ie Sean Gallagher running for President of Ireland is bizarre seems you have nothing to offer of your own except find fault with Michael D negative words are all you know
@lionsofficial Happy birthday Paul you are one great guy Gentleman legend in your lifetime üëçüèâ
@IrishTimes Yes Mary you‚Äôre correct as things are at the moment the peace in NI is on a knife edge there are people on both sides with a vested interest in causing trouble, and all the hard work done by you and others will be lost, stay well Mary you were a great President thank you üôè
@Independent_ie George there are people jumping our border everyday this is a special case I know it‚Äôs the law and if we break our own law it could set a precedent in law if we are not careful how about giving him a 90 year visa to visit
@JOEdotie You see no respect for authority at any level as I said a tug in a suit this is the way the travelers would act I rest my case
@Independent_ie You have to be one of the stupidest people on the planet to make a statement like that but then you a Fianna F√°il TD no wonder you are where you are in the pols, with people like you and your mindset no wonder you the FF set got us in the mess we were in Bankruptcy Ireland?
@coleman_padraic @Independent_ie Yes he did and even he knows he did it is not whether the travelers are right or wrong and I agree he is right about travelers causing trouble as the President he can not hold these reduces he is supposed to be a President for all the people without race color or creed
@RareIrishStuff @donlav Dev. you Shit, what a contribution Micheal Collins world have made
@BigDunc123 George Simon worries about everyone‚Äôs well being, you used to be a good blue shirt üëï what‚Äôs gone wrong
@IrishTimesLife @IrishTimes The dragons have no creditably or moral compasses and are wrapped up in their own  self importance god help Ireland, O my Dark Rosaleen  Do Not Sigh Do Not Weep  The Dragons are on the Ocean Green they March beneath the Deep
@IrishTimes I agree with Eddie Moran‚Äôs comments re property, Garda, and respect
@gardarep @TomClonan Well done guys üëçthank you
@IrishTimes She was at fault as she‚Äôs admitted why the compensation?
@Independent_ie If you make a mistake you could say sorry and continue that would be the manly thing to do
@TheRadioOfficer @thejournal_ie Anyone who uses insults and bad manners towards others can never be ok,Casey and others has to realize he is not running as a politician to form part of the government where he can vote on legislation he is running for the Presidency who has to be impartial in all matters
@LovinDublin That‚Äôs a nice story you are famous as well for assaulting Michea D you will have to vote for him now to repay him for the assault
@IrishTimesPol @IrishTimes Don‚Äôt mind that FF Td all he wants is a bit of publicity on the cheap or maybe he is trying to impress someone if he had anything to say he should have said it before the vote doesn‚Äôt say much for his ability to make a decision
@thejournal_ie Sean Gallagher is a dopey think of something new to talk about or is that all there is to you
@IrishTimesOpEd @IrishTimes T know where his Blue heart üíú is lake my own cheers üçª Michael well done
@Independent_ie Fool
@Independent_ie People with his attitude has no place in our country particularly in public life
@IrishTimesPol @IrishTimes Fintan you got it in one,  however voters we‚Äôre misled at election time I have a vote in UK as well as Ireland I am happy to say I vote conservative and my MP asked me to vote to leave I did had I known what I know now I would not have
@JOEdotie Simon is very able politically and otherwise to do battle with the best he is well versed and knowledgeable on all aspects of of his role we are lucky to have him, he  didn‚Äôt lick of the ground either good luck Simon you have a tough job many thanks
@IrishTimesPol @IrishTimes I am delighted for you you are decent man and no family let alone you should have to endure such wrongs shame on those who perpetrated these wrongs against you and when one sees the collateral damage caused to others commissioner, minister double shame bless you and good luck
@MaryOGrady8 @IrishTimesOpEd @IrishTimes I am not criticizing Micheal D I am praising him and my family‚Äô are voting for him the other was chit chat with you, thank you for the info
@MaryOGrady8 @IrishTimesOpEd @IrishTimes So why did Presidents in the past say they want the attorney Generals opinion ? Does the President send it back to the government to get the advice of the Attorney?
@Independent_ie Doesn‚Äôt matter where he goes he is a nobody
@NewstalkFM Thank you Charlie that‚Äôs the decent thing to do but you are a member of F.G. who will always do decent thing
@MaryOGrady8 @IrishTimesOpEd @IrishTimes What I answered was the suggestion that the President resign to campaign if he did that he could not sign as President and the President has plenty of time to sign and if has doubts about legislation he can forward it to the Attorney General for his opinion that could take time
@Ke_Molloy @donlav @CaseyPeterJ What an clown the President has no power whatsoever others than signing the documents on decisions made by the government the seat of power is with the government does Casey know nothing about the dynamics‚Äôs of the state and its rules there are plenty of schools for adults try it
@IrishTimes Peter Casey should pray to saint Loman or if he choose Saint Dymphna who are patron saints of the mentally disturbed all he can do is pick on people and find faults in their lives and then he has the nerve to think people would vote for him the others are distancing themselves
@IrishTimes Peter Casey should pray to Saint Loman
@thejournal_ie Peter Casey should pull out of the Presidential election he is without doubt one of the ugliest people I ever heard it is an insult to the Irish people for a country council to nominate him there is no doubt there is a village missing an idiot god protect Ireland üáÆüá™ from that
@IrishTimes Thank is what you get when one runs a decent statesman‚Äôs like good mannered campaign the others have no decorum, no manners, not educated and with no ability how to conduct themselves with the public they atacting like Tugs
@thejournal_ie The reason Casey is so insignificant mr 2% in the polls is his negative campaign attitude to the Presidents office his bad manners and his inability to realize that Ireland is a very different place now, as the referendum has proved the Catholic Church and others are gone
@IrishTimesOpEd @IrishTimes He couldn‚Äôt as if there was something to be signed into law there would be no one there to do so
@IrishTimesOpEd @IrishTimes I agree the Esb are the best people to do that job now you‚Äôre making sense
@donlav @Andrew_Adonis Yes mostly by the British
@IrishTimesPol @IrishTimes And why wouldn‚Äôt he , he is a very decent man
@neil_skippy @rtenews Don‚Äôt be reduced to that way of thinking he is not a showman like the others who are full of their own self importance to have the presidents job on their CV ,like the old proverb says some of the people can wrong sometimes all of the people can‚Äôt be wrong all of the time
@SkySportsRugby @Munsterrugby What a fantastic man rugby üèâ player and all round nice guy you left your mark on Irish ‚òòÔ∏è Rugby you will be remembered fondly praise the lord for your with us Rest In Peace
@HangBlaa Yes it is
@thejournal_ie Yes Leo lets go
@HangBlaa John I think you‚Äôre taking a different interpretation of the meaning nation to Arlene‚Äôs meaning but one would never know
@alisonoconn Why would Micheal D lower the standards of the Presidents office by attending or getting involved in a debate with a bunch of misfits who don‚Äôt know their ass from their elbow it is without doubt the worst lineup that has ever ran in the election for President Casey I ask you
@rtenews You sound so stupid me me me do you not realize the revulsion the people have towards you, you are bad mannered, your insulting, what kind of image would we have in the world if you were president we would be the laughingstock of the world
@rtenews @ClaireByrneLive What a clown ü§°
@HangBlaa @donlav I agree
@rtenews Sean Gallagher couldn‚Äôt debate with a class of school kids clown
@IrishTimes What a clown doesn‚Äôt know where to post his letters Gallagher seems to have joined Casey in stupidity ranks god help Ireland with a misfit like him surely he must have a doctor to help him with his problems, compared to that lot Micheal D looks like God
@IrishTimes Because to much of its budget goes on management who do nothing for the salary they receive and are surplus to requirement doctors, nurses, and medical stuff is where the money should go as well as beds
@Murray_Kinsella Great staff Rory üëç
@UlsterRugby Absolutely and why not cheers lads
@thejournal_ie Well done lads you are to be commended for doing the right thing you have a big responsibility and you did what was needed thank you
@IrishTimesPol @IrishTimes And so he should good luck Denis
@IrishTimesWorld @IrishTimes Not a chance nothing you have to say will pay the bills that is all the voters are interested in and Trump is doing that
@IrishTimes Just goes to show the type they are utterly stupid and useless unable to say we were wrong sorry they would have done a lot of good for themselves by doing so
@MichaelDHiggins I agree President Michael D in mixed schools where the girls and boys are together in class the boys do better than they do in all boys classes the Girls do make the boys do better all through their lives, yes Micheals D feminism is Ok
@NiamhoNiamh @BrianODriscoll Fantastic from the great man
@retrochbabe @donlav Martin Luther saw that ugliness centuries ago hence the berth of the Protestant Church praise the lord it would be worth ones time to read up on it,the Catholic Church is about collecting money and wealth the Protestant Church is about the congregation and their spiritual state
@UlsterRugby @Dicksondigital @KingspanStadium @michaellowry15 @JacobStockdale @Jordimurphy @ALOConnor4 Your welcome thank you üôè
@sinead_ryan You got it in one Sinead deeply dislikable with no manners or anything resembles a statesman more like a Tug in a suit the what is he doing in the race ? Does he not realize this is a President of Ireland üáÆüá™ election , I do believe some villagers are missing an idiot
@UlsterRugby @JCooney09 Yes John congratulations üçæ on man of the match you deserve it well done fantastic performance good luck
@BrianODriscoll @MiriamOCal Yes Miriam I agree and it was Brian‚Äôs personality that helped make it so interesting and balanced great man cheers Brian üëç
@IrishTimesPol @IrishTimes When we listen to the appalling way that circus clown Peter Casey spoke in that debate you wouldn‚Äôt give him a job as a car park attendant Sean Gallagher and Gavin Duffey didn‚Äôt do any better listening to them and what they had to say was thy best reason to vote for Micheal D
@seangallagher1 God help us if he got elected
@Independent_ie Well done girl good luck üëç
@IrishTimesWorld @IrishTimes Not enough it‚Äôs only token gestures
@MichaelDHiggins I agree the only statesman in the race Micheal Düëç
@IrishTimes Good luck and best wishes to Richard and the other appointments in your new office I wish you well
@JOEdotie Apart From Michael D I find it hard to believe we have the cost of a presidential election brought about by the worst bunch of misfits the nation could muster up all of them fully paid up members of the self administration society, they should stop looking in the mirror
@IrishTimesOpEd @IrishTimes Commissioner Drew Harris will clean that mess up and whip the force into shape üëç
@IrishTimesWorld @IrishTimes The Pope reluctantly accepted the resignation of Cardinal Wurel for sexual abuse on children what kind of monster is he, he should have been booted out or sent to prison
@thejournal_ie After reading Judge Carlton‚Äôs report I hope the public has noticed Noirin Sullivan, Frances Fitzgerald, Allen Shatter one Maurice McCabe  were all showing to be honorable and decent people shame on those who messed up their lives, and remember KARMA ???
@MichaelDHiggins @donlav @PatKennyNT Yes Micheal D is dealing with issues like a president the real reason he will win
@irishtimesvideo @IrishTimes You don‚Äôt have to be elected president to promote the role of women in politics just do it those angles are cheap and and will get you nowhere
@IrishTimes Who needs a hit man when they have your lot and the slurry pits in Galway
@Independent_ie Bastard
@rtenews @wallacemick It is the craziest building on the planet when they allow a crazy person like you inside you seem to be talking rubbish non stop
@IrishTimes Thank the lord Ireland is no longer defined a Catholic country or where have you been in the last ten years what a persons sexual orientation is is nothing to do with ability to do a good job as Leo has proven the most popular prime minister we ever had
@thejournal_ie Don‚Äôt stop doing what you do right will never be wrong as Karma will prove
@IT_HealthPlus @IrishTimes Very sad day for all praise the lord for Emma‚Äôs time on earth and I hope she has awakened all who are in a position to give the best advice and medical treatment to prevent what happened Emma in the future god bless you RIP Emma
@JOEdotie Dopey
@IrishTimes I agree
@Independent_ie What a stupid man doesn‚Äôt he realize the the damage he is doing to  his Church or is he the same as the abuser priest he has vowed to stamp out ??
@marybuckley549 @donlav @IrishTimes I agree he has lost all moral respect and he would be better keeping his mouth shut the Catholic Church has abused women and children and they are still doing it shame on you
@ghook George I am surprised at you a good old blue shirt like your self picking on your own
@DublinAirport @donlav @aeroflot Now you‚Äôre talking there‚Äôs a trade counter cheers üçª

@JOEdotie David you have given us a lifetime of the best natural life documentary films you have done more in your world wide travels to help endangered species and made people aware of our planet than any one else you have a very calming affect on your viewership bless you and thank you
@Independent_ie I predict Micheal by a landslide because the others are so bad and the President so good üòä praise the lord for Michael D he will get my vote and that‚Äôs  saying a lot from a right wing conservative Protestant to a left wing socialist like Ml D üëç
@donlav @mupper2 I agree the Navy needs beefing up as well as the Garda to combat drugs,trafficking of all illegal items thankfully they don‚Äôt have the same freedom in the skies and  Pilots are lookouts we have the drug hotline in our bag it‚Äôs the same all over
@donlav @mupper2 We do monitor our airspace and the IAA collect millions of euro from other countries for doing as a pilot I know how regulated the airspace is in every country including Ireland, we are not in the Middle East or close to conflict zones we have other priorities  at the moment
@mupper2 @donlav Don the Britain will always protect us brexit or not as David Cameron stated when they wrote the cheque for Billions to bail us out when asked would he be doing the same Greece, etc. he stated no Ireland is the only country in Europe we have anything in common with, they love us
@Independent_ie You‚Äôre wife should look at facts he put plastic in a lake he thinks Donegal is in UK and he hasn‚Äôt a clue about protocol and the Presidents job and when he was caught driving golf balls into the lake polluting when  he realized the public outcry like a child i dived in and got it
@thejournal_ie That Animal should never be allowed out prison life with hard time in a Russia
@NewstalkFM Good luck man
@donlav Don who would to attack friendly old Ireland üáÆüá™ and by the way we would build a lot of houses with price of a Gripen
@TommyBowe14 @eirSport Don‚Äôt rub it in  Tommy I know you‚Äôre quite a comedian in your own right and a very nice guy  but that‚Äôs cruelty mate
@RichardbrutonTD @donlav Thank you Richard Bruton It takes 	F.G. To do the right thing that‚Äôs the reason I vote FG and always will many thanks üôè
@HangBlaa If Micheal Collins had been the head of state this would have been a better country Emon Dev. and Catholic Church would not have got away with the atrocities unmarried mothers had to put up with, perhaps Mick. was a relation of yours he was a great man
@HangBlaa Like it
@leinsterrugby @joshvdf What a man cheers mate
@Independent_ie Yes Brendan I agree with most of your article, when you say we respond to items and statements made by others in a reactive way that‚Äôs when we become aware of the mindset of the author like Isaac Newton‚Äôs 3rd law of relativity we react to this that is how we learn and do better
@simongerman600 @davidmcw Especially when they did not have phones,planes,internet, just carrier pigeons, smoke signals, and slow boats as Bruce Forsyth said didn‚Äôt they do well
@KenBrownGolf @SkySportsGolf Here here
@rtenews This problem would not have come to the attention Richard Bruton if it were not highlighted by the court case Mr Briton a very decent man will fix the problem now that he knows about it of that you can be assured
@thejournal_ie Mainly because Micheal D has been a champion for the less well off and oppressed for years he has been campaigning as a politically elected member of the house he is a professor with a great knowledge of life not like the clowns who are running against him the self admired
@IrishTimes What a clown should have kept his mouth shut it gets worse for him if he searched for a week he would not find a golf ball in the Lough is that the moment he realized what he did was wrong you are supposed to make these decisions like a grownup god help us if he ever got elected
@JOEdotie Maybe it‚Äôs the Americans attitude that‚Äôs affected him
@IrishTimes It‚Äôs scandalous that a student works hard and stressful time coming to exams then some dimwit marks the paper wrongly it is not good enough to say sorry and remark a year later without any regard for the students losses the person who marks the paper should be fined in some way
@IrishTimesOpEd @IrishTimes @fotoole Fintan the people of Gibraltar want to stay as they are
@IrishTimes Careful what you wish for Micheal that FF tiger is dead , and he didn‚Äôt father any cubs we had to create a new mold for Ireland üáÆüá™ Leo Varadkar, as Taoiseach,Abortion,the wish of the people ,Catholic Church, put in their place Drew Harris as Garda commissioner all good stuff
@Independent_ie Peter Casey knows nothing about pollution or geography or what the presidents job is , as he is a member of the self admiration society he has no chance
@OldCrescentRFC1 @qubrfc @IrishRugby They won‚Äôt be that bad will they ??
@donlav @PeterMurtagh What a stupid man how could you take someone like him seriously he thinks the water is the fairway, he cannot see Donegal and his geography may not be good but he can see the water
@GardaTraffic Nice one üëç
@Independent_ie It‚Äôs a start
@Independent_ie That‚Äôs not the way to go if he raped you he may have gone on and raped others as he got away with it sex abuse on children and women is the worst of all crimes you should report it even now
@SamuelLJackson That is a very stupid video to make about a very serious matter the problem with this video is there are so many uninformed people who will not know it is fiction not reality and that‚Äôs not good for people who are sexually abused funny no thanks
@RoryBest2 Doctor Rory Best you cannot beat the farmer when it comes to bringing one dawn to reality the Ryder Cup doesn‚Äôt have a look in when it comes to an Aberdeenangus

@thejournal_ie She looks better than the paintings
@HangBlaa John the French do dam all trade with us Britain is our biggest market and we are theirs
@BPOB @IrishTimesWorld @IrishTimes With good reason freedom of expression is alive and well in Ireland hiding your identity unless you are a policeman is not
@Latinogar @IrishTimesWorld @IrishTimes More stupidity we can see their faces to identify them
@PatriciaMAC10 @IrishTimesWorld @IrishTimes What a stupid statement you should be more careful embarrassing yourself and your family like that people will talk
@HangBlaa We need Britain, Britain need us there are more than three times as many Irish people living in Britain as  are in Ireland they need our brain power and our creative minds thats why we box well above our weight on the world stage Dev no Collins would would have made a difference
@rtenews Fantastic The big gentle giant I know him well he had only good things to say about people and life in general he told me one time ( I think I was ment to be an old farmer) well Big Man you made a lot of people very happy üòä good to see him sitting there praise the lord RIP
@IrishTimesPol @IrishTimes Micheal if you took a leaf out of Leo‚Äôs book you might do better is your politics now that of protest rather then come up with something positive young people relate to Leo or haven‚Äôt you noticed it is the young people are who will decide the future of our country think positive
@IT_HealthPlus @IrishTimes Not good for his health mental or physical you need to teach him to be positive about everything which means in definition everything may not turn out the way he wants but being positive means he will be OK no matter what the outcome
@IrishTimesSport @IrishTimes This is the least talked about Ryder Cup in my lifetime is that because it‚Äôs in France ??

@Independent_ie Micheal D did a good job and he will win the main reason is the other candidates are so weak as far as Joe Public is concerned they have nothing in common or anything to offer they are self entitled self centered megalomaniacs with no idea what the Presidential duty‚Äôs are
@NewstalkFM Thank you commissioner
@JOEdotie The person or persons who made these threats should be hunted down using all the power at the disposal of the state and made an example of so I hope this answers the balaclava question dimwits
@IrishTimes Definitely not presidential material Gavin you need to be made of statesman material of which you are not and this is not the USA as I said megalomania it can be treated
@annatters Well done guys congrats

@HangBlaa Rubbish John the Garda should use whatever means at their disposal to stay safe and keep you safe and you may or may not know we are policed in a democracy by consent the Garda stand between us and anarchy you should be ashamed of your self if you have the ability?
@TJ_Politics @thejournal_ie Micheal have you the remotest idea what you are talking about regarding health and housing like the Catholic Church‚Äôs ramblings about their wrongs why don‚Äôt you man up and accept the mess you created and say sorry and get on with the job you were elected to do people are fed up
@NewstalkFM What a load crap the Irish people remember you broke the Banks you broke the construction industry you should bow your head in shame you all went into hiding and let others fix the mess you created now you are sneaking out hoping no one noticed we do,scoundrels have manners
@TommyBowe14 Tommy I don‚Äôt believe your were nervous üòâyou made other players nervous üòü cheers
