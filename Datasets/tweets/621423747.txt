.@AndrewGillum tells young aud: get in touch w/ what‚Äôs motivating you to go into public service. The job is not the goal, it‚Äôs the tool.
"At the most basic level it‚Äôs: provide fresh water, take water away &amp; pick up trash. It‚Äôs not sexy, but it's necessary‚Äù @AnniseParker conts.
"Mayors lead, manage, solve problems, convene &amp; represent. In many ways, mayors are the public face of their cities,‚Äù says @AnniseParker
2/2 ppl want to know why something isn‚Äôt working &amp; how it‚Äôs going to be fixed &amp; they often go to their mayors first with those Qs &amp; problems
1/2 panelists express sentiment that most ppl will be able to name their mayor, even if they can‚Äôt name their state or fed officials.
Mayors, esp of cities, are stepping up to fill gaps where state &amp; fed gov can‚Äôt or won't address solutions to problems, says @BlairMiloLP

RT @NewsbySchmidt: UChicago freshman wants to know how to "make local politics sexier." #GenForwardSurvey @UChiPolitics
2/2 @davidaxelrod responds to @emmaogreen that maybe this is b/c "young people feel that we‚Äôve made real progress on these issues"

@northsidekhan we will post the video on our website tomorrow - https://t.co/V1wJ67CD4X
2/2 "I think young people have a big bulls* meter. We call them the #basketofexplorables‚Äù - @davidaxelrod
1/2 @davidaxelrod adds ‚Äúthis is a dispiriting election. It‚Äôs hard to get motivated simply by your distaste for other candidate."
Young ppl are skepitcal abt whether politics is effective way 2 engage, says @davidaxelrod, but reminds audience: politics &amp; voting matters

Crowd cheers when Isom is asked if he'll apply to become the new Chicago police chief, but he says, "I don't plan to at this point in time"

Isom on Rahm: "Whether the mayor leaves or not is not going to solve the underlying issues in the community."
.@jamiekalven on Rahm: "He inherited this mess. He didn't create it." But now with this crisis "he could be a significant agent of change"
Isom: Most police depts haven't made these major reforms on their own - "It's taken a push from the federal govt to make real true change."
