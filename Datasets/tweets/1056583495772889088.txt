Unc has become a thousand times more charming with one ball than he ever was compared to his inferior, average, normie previous 2 ball version of himself lol 😅 https://t.co/KXBoRmp13r
@UncAlbert Calm down killer lol 🤣
@BrianCo26816237 In some cases I had to just let my friends "burn their hands on the stove" so to speak for them to finally get the message I was frustratingly attempting to get across to them ya know? but there's always hope, he's got a good friend in you brother.
@soberpod The very moment I got honest with myself and honest with everyone in my life regarding my drug use / addiction was the exact moment where people gravitated towards me to show support which I had never before experienced. Never felt so alone when I would lie about my past relapses
Alright Squadron, our deepest apologies for our lagger ass procrastinating ways.  our past character defects are quite the challenges to lay to rest but today we have a wonderful new episode being dropped today, Much love to all of you and hope your Saturday is a good one 😜
@BrianCo26816237 honestly I wouldn't know what to do either but I hope you make it to the other side in one piece with your health and recovery in tact , &lt;3
@madflavor @UncAlbert We can do a phone call or whatever is easiest for you, I remember I used to see you at Kush Mart getting that Matt's #1 OG back in the day and I never really wanted to bother you but now that I'm off the horse and have a podcast telling war stories I always knew you told the best

@JustinEngland8 @Brandon_Novak He will always remain in my mind the most "born gifted" professional skateboarders I've ever witnessed. My most memorable Novak moment was in "Haggard's" bonus features concerning his heroin addiction, the scene with his "NoMoreFuckingHeroin" tattoo is forever burn into my brain
@Brandon_Novak I just wanted to thank you for everything that you are doing. Your message really saved my life and got me to look at NA &amp; the 12 steps in a completely new light. I would really enjoy having you on our @NodSquadPodcast if you were ever free to talk recovery with us
Everyone in our fellow squadron please go check out @Brandon_Novak 's podcast. I literally just discovered it myself and am going to play an episode right now and know with sincere confidence that his content is constantly being of assistance to those struggling out there still&lt;3 https://t.co/MO3evZjnw9

Mans over here judging my junkie ass for not paying my phone bill, meanwhile I'm trolling him out on a $3,000 Macbook Pro , #irony https://t.co/zHV5wbeE10
@TIME Good article, nice read.  I think you forgot to include the whole "end privatized prisons from enslaving / exploiting addicts for monetary gain," part of this entire "promising method to help our countries pandemic" &lt;3
@CheeseTheLion @TIME lol, bitch I can get free internet at the library. Mans don't need a phone.
@UncAlbert end the drug war? and cause privatized prisons to sacrifice billions off of exploiting / enslaving addicts for monetary gain? Sir, our elite overlords cackle at our cries for policy reform &lt;3 https://t.co/9cvjnm3g5B
@fuck_heroin best friends, loved ones, girlfriends. Lost too many to count, need to band together and keep each other strong through it all &lt;3
@JustinEngland8 also, thank you!
@JustinEngland8 I'm quickly learning how bad too much caffeine kick starts my anxiety lol. Still pretty early in my recovery, still shaking off old habits 🤪
@JustinEngland8 "my man" is still socially acceptable by my standards brother.  I'd love to have you on the podcast sometime &lt;3
@AminamAmbien https://t.co/wOjDxqMbq5
@AminamAmbien just answer the door wearing a strap on, they will never come a knocking again ;D
So. one of my best friends got kicked out of court ordered rehab and is turning himself in today to possibly to do a year in jail.  I'm pretty bummed out you guys :/
@JustinEngland8 Thank you brother, I really appreciate that.  I still have a little bit of the PAWS and my ADHD is running rampant but something clicked inside of me finally that made me actually want recovery this time. really thankful &lt;3
@JustinEngland8 oh my dude, I fucking hate the sound of my voice. I sound like a perma stoned, more awkward, stuttering Elliot Rodgers with Add D:. Collect your writings you do online and put out a book, I bet your past is fascinating
@JustinEngland8 I hope my past life debauchery entertains you my friend ;D
@JustinEngland8 I was like "Push ups? dude, my addiction doesn't NEED to do push ups lol. It's on steroids, meth and pcp and has the strength to bring down lucifer himself." lols.  I'm 20 days clean today and for the first time I'm actually enjoying my sobriety &lt;3
@AcquiescentSoul I get stuck inside my thoughts too and think the same things my friend. It's important to reach out and talk to friends and loved ones, for me at least it distracts me until those feelings and thoughts pass &lt;3
more fascinating reads for you guys &lt;3 https://t.co/S9DS1Qh6F5

@JustinEngland8 @Dopeypodcast https://t.co/i1ZA4QRvwY	@JustinEngland8 here's a link in case you're still having trouble. Thank you for taking time to check out our silly tales of debauchery &lt;3 @Dopeypodcast gave @UncAlbert the missing ball he needed to muster up the courage to put @NodSquadPodcast out there.
@JustinEngland8 Yes, I like that :D.  Because I'm SO SICK of hearing "my addiction is out in the parking lot doing pushups," at meetings 😂 I will punch my addiction in the throat and swift knee kick it in the groin lol
