@nickiknowsnada She learned from a true expert.
@PoliticDeb Don't agree with much that you do but love and would like to have a discussion - maybe a debate.  Many friends on both sides.  :)
@BloombergAsia Maybe if somebody held Pakistan accountable it would help.  A true terrorist state who gave nuke material to N. Korea and supports both A Qaeda and the Taliban.  Maybe we should put sanctions on them instead of Iran.
@smithcoreyd1 I do all the time and have to constantly battle the clutter of false starts
@BetteMidler Gotta say as a man with eyes that work loved the sexy appeal... but it's about time women stepped and called it what it is
@joncoopertweets More likely after
@EdKrassen Really... who the devil is he?
@thomaskaine5 Age, commitment, and wherewithal on a long stressful campaign trail could be a problem.  Linked awful close to Hillary also.
The DEMS are precariously close to helping the Trumpets reelect their hero in 2020 by becoming so divided on policies increasingly moving out of the mainstream
@peterdaou I'm think8ng Biden and Harris will end up fighting it out
@SenSchumer @EPA Just one more example of letting the fox in the hen house by the Trump administration
Do you remember when you joined Twitter? I do! #MyTwitterAnniversary Twitter is where it's at https://t.co/AePHYfQgut
Do you remember when you joined Twitter? I do! #MyTwitterAnniversary https://t.co/CyuNfvARGR
@gtconway3d @Trth2Pwer68 Just another lie Trump told
@thomaskaine5 Actually plenty... blanket descriptions are dangerous
@MikeKlis Love that guy!
@thehill This is where some of the leftist myth lies.    Actually the super wealthy make most of their income outside of normal salaries in stocks and investments... meaning capital gains where you actually should go.
@SenGillibrand Sad and disgusting.  Shameful.
@KamalaHarris Keep pushing the bar!
@jillythomas @GOP The voters will ultimately decide
@byMorganWright I hate editing... the hardest part of writing a book.
@EdKrassen But remember he's saying what they want to hear and believe.
@nytimes Explain to me how it is that this President is so ready to defend a known brutal totalitarian dictator against or won't regular American people.
@cneitzert @SenGillibrand You are 100% correct
@byMorganWright Disagree.  They can change gear and write in any number.
@SocialPowerOne1 Really!  How dare you after all the "lock her up" bullshit.
@EricHolder Only way you can defend a liar to attack and confuse
@SenSchumer @senatemajldr Be sure not to hold your breath
@EricHolder Nobody's minds changed today
@realDonaldTrump Waiting for verifiable actions
@EdKrassen Sure as hell has killed my opinion of him the last 2 years
@LunaZin_YR Colorado
@MSNBC @AriMelber Tampering and intimidation for sure
@joncoopertweets @TheDemCoalition Removal...?  Sentured maybe
@EdKrassen @realDonaldTrump Hmmm...
@washingtonpost Simply admires them and their power.  Envious I think...
@politico Da.... he should damned well apologize!  Unacceptable conduct to a witness no matter his opinion
I love Twitter... so much better than Facebook.  You can express yourself and reach out to all sorts of folks
@LibertyConv @EricHolder I agree this is a short sighted mistake by Dems upset by what happened in 2016.  The electoral college serves a special but hard to understand role that guarantees small states keep a stake in our Presidential electoral process.  Why we are a republican not an electoral democracy
@EmaLaineAuthor Let's connect
@SenGillibrand Men should recuse themselves
@joshtpm She failed to even answer the question then inserted her own pathetic elitism
@MSNBC When it looks like acts like talks like it is...
@docrocktex26 @BuzzFeedNews Don't tell Trump... he'll declare another national emergency
@JuddLegum This is a nice tactical move so he doesn't become the focus and Rs can claim a clean slate
@cathygoodge1 @SenSchumer @senatemajldr Amazing analysis
@politico That should make us all safer
@realDonaldTrump Especially since you already gave them a massive tax supported buyout gift
@krassenstein This should be real interesting... 2 compulsive liars fighting it out
@CoryBooker @steinheim2 Only fair so long as no violence involved
@PattyMurray @SecretaryAcosta This scum should be in Super Max for life... maybe 2!
@MSNBC You think.... ?
@politico Gotta wonder what a group of self entitled male majority lawmakers might actually have the same potential exposure in their own past... Pandora's box anybody?
Wow... can we get to a 1000!  Love the conversations about politics, wine, and writing!
For all is the ultimate goal but must be ready to take functional steps to get there... pre-conditions and cost of drugs key https://t.co/RPuX0egHFG
@EricHolder Not so sure... needs more careful discussion
@Bornabrit1 Arrogant and determined to have a deal no matter the cost to show his pathetic base
@9NEWSSports Wow... they really are in it for the long run.
@JosephMKavanag1 Some before but most as I write... so easy with google at your fingertips.
@ProudResister @IvankaTrump Sorry but just another entitled rich b.....
@PhilipRucker Hmmm... should we worry?  I as sure hell do!
@politico WELL WHAT A SURPRISE!
@krassenstein All lie who disagree with "Da Man"
@joncoopertweets He's drunk on dictatorial power
@KyleClark @GovofCO This will be a big mistake if it passes mustard across the country.
@SocialPowerOne1 Bullshit... he's a selfish rich guy supporting a despicable criminal enterprise where young women are forced into sex slavery
@kolbeck_j Fudgy
@kolbeck_j Yeah a well made brownie
@ewarren Let's see if you really stick to that
@Shareblue Heard he's pissed as hell at the announcement
@Shareblue There could be some built in bias in that survey... the first of which is there hasn't been enough history yet to properly judge the current one
@MKGenest I got better things to do
@byMorganWright I prefer to use my own real name... nothing to hide from
@ParkerMcCoy7 Clayton l8ke so many others of that generation was and still is at 96
@DebbieGrimshaw2 Thanks back.  Love to write and we both love our Beagle dog.
@SocialPowerOne1 It is fundamentally misguided thinking but his comment misses the point with so many struggling Americans who've come to rely on it
@joncoopertweets ARE YOU LISTENING DEMOCRATS!  Best not take them or anything for granted.  Remember the guy already beat you when you thought you were a shoe in.
@politico It's sadly a revenue based business with a constant willing to pay customer base
@RoebuckSteve1 I am a wine enthusiast with little talent, a questionable pallet, and shallow pockets I am willing to spend who loves talking the grapes
@EdKrassen For them it's all about the race war and power of the white elite
@realDonaldTrump Maybe they should say you'll get them as soon as you release your tax returns
@CNNPolitics @ellis_texas Way to go... a deal no matter the cost...  A guy named Chamberlain tried that several decades ago and if my reading of history is correct it didn't work out all that well for a hundred million people
@DanRather @mshopemac Prudent idea
@krassenstein @FLpalmtree1 Yep... have agree with that seeming oxymoron
@RWPUSA She's a wealthy donor which of course translates to intelligence
@ShelbyKStewart @highbrow_nobrow What a pathetic moron
@joncoopertweets Flattery is golden to our precious leader
@HuffPostPol He's a slimy parasite
@byMorganWright Future Is Inspiration
@SocialPowerOne1 At least there is some common decency that forces that kind of ugliness to be accountable
@thomaskaine5 I find that hard to believe... but again I could be off base to some realities
@thehill @HillTVLive Please make it from the back burner!!!
@SocialPowerOne1 Funny he didn't give the young black gay actor the same benefit of the doubt
@KamalaHarris Not sure of that but getting control of rampant greed in the medical industry and holding them accountable would be a wonderful start
@RealMuckmaker Sorry, he made his own bed
@EdKrassen Any man or woman who uses children as a political weapon is both despicable and criminal.
@FranncescaRobi1 We don't have to guess.  It would be throw them all out and build the wall.  But a white guy who wants to commit mass murder - SILENCE!
@Stop_Trump20 @JanetDa40222513 Sorry but she and those like her are traitors to their gender.
@KamalaHarris What the hell ever happened to unbiased apolitical science?
@ewarren If true that is a troubling statistic.  The question to ask is what the reasons ate
I like to think I'm a pretty open minded compassionate person but any who threw their support to ISIS and preached their brand of brutality should NEVER be allowed back in the country.
@MyMine1001 @washingtonpost Trust me when I say I don't need to be instructed to hate and despise all Donald Trump stands for.  Thought he's a bullying moron for 25 years.
@NPR What a moron
@Shareblue Nothing new
@joncoopertweets And the corrupt beat marches on
@politico Bout time
@krassenstein Does this mean it really happens?
@KDVR This is an absolute joke
@Bornabrit1 Still got their head in the sand
@GShapiro9News @Kyle__Dyer @SusieWargin Nice!
@RedTRaccoon A joke if it's not overturned
@EdKrassen @seanhannity They just can't get over it
@politico Let him sue... sorry she made her choice to commit treason against her country
@EdKrassen Poor baby...
@SenSchumer @realDonaldTrump It's a travesty if nothing is done
@MileHighReport Sad to see him go... no doubt a money deal.  Still wondering about Sanders and his huge contract
@MyMine1001 @washingtonpost Hmmm... wonder why we don't seem to apply the same logic toIran
@kimchinam58 @MKGenest They would sign with the devil himself so long as he said he was against abortion... oh that's right they already did with Trump
@MyMine1001 @washingtonpost Keep making excuses... SA has been seeking nuke technology for years to counter Iran
@Mach__77 @washingtonpost Now let me ask just where the government gets its money?
@KamalaHarris He needs to serve time.  Enables the racist and anti gay abusers
@jeremyjojola @9NEWS Glad to here it.
@EdKrassen She is a sick and despicable person
@bryanbehar Standard issue with Comrade Trump.
@Comey A true and honest patriot.  Thank you!
@KStrongOT One issue voters
@NBCInvestigates @Trth2Pwer68 @KenDilanianNBC @PeteWilliamsNBC And we trained this monster with taxpayer dollars.  Unbelievable!
@EdKrassen Just imagine if this was all under Obama's watch... they would be going crazy and demanding articles of impeachment
@RonWyden Vote fraud has been a tool in the south for a hundred and fifty years
@dcarter0515 Hell our whole country has for decades.  How many of the 9-11 terrorists came from there?
@realDonaldTrump Maybe they should... grants and support from taxpayer dollars should be conditional
@SocialPowerOne1 So why should we be surprised - are you listening John Roberts?
@dcarter0515 ANYBODY BUT TRUMP 2020!!
@is_kathie @realDonaldTrump ADD TO THE CHAOS 2020
@TIME A damned good movie regardless what the so called experts say or complain
@AP Hang him by his toes... jail time!
@SenFeinstein @davidcicilline Dead on arrival in the retrogressive controlled senate
@timkaine One can only hope.  Any bets?
@SenatorCollins Yeah but will you stand behind him when Trump launches his attack?  My bet is you won't
@politico The start of a generational change
@EdKrassen Not holding my breath
@washingtonpost Transferring nuclear technology without approval is treason
@SocialPowerOne1 What a joke and waste of time.  They need to give it a rest.
@VicLombardi Sound advice
@matthewjdowd Interesting isn't it
@MSNBC What the hell was the idiot thinking?
@ewarren Just got to figure out how to pay for it
@GOP @LaraLeaTrump True on the econ9mic side
@nexton9news @VicLombardi Best wishes to a good man
@mmpadellan @44vreiki Think you are right... likely to have more questions than answers and not make any on either side happy
@MKGenest Admiration from a guy who is envious of his unrestricted power who wishes he could be him
@CNanceAnnouncer @MunkyHut @AlexRoseNews @KDVR @aurorak12 It is possible
@fev7777777 Don't agree with you but love your passion... it is what makes our country great and special
@MunkyHut @CNanceAnnouncer @AlexRoseNews @KDVR @aurorak12 Rob you got that right... a toast to you!
@washingtonpost How did this guy ever get to be an officer in the Coast Guard?  As a tax payer who helped pay for his training I'm enraged!
Looking for followers to reach 500... I love the conversation with all points of view and follow back the who honor me by joining the discussion.
@CNanceAnnouncer @MunkyHut @AlexRoseNews @KDVR @aurorak12 Yeah I agree with that.  Still wonder how we got here.  So much stress and anger.  One guy dead another to be in prison the rest of his life.  Both stolen from us.
@JackrabbitInfo @KarenAttiah @RacoonSquadron @JussieSmollett Why don't you show some statistics to prove that ridiculous analysis.
@CNanceAnnouncer @MunkyHut @AlexRoseNews @KDVR @aurorak12 Shoot an unarmed man, really?  Sounding more and more like the old west every day
@MileHighReport Why not try and help your team.
@SocialPowerOne1 Never let the truth get in your way... lies told enough become truth.  Read about it in Mien Kampf
@politico She should just to protect the moron from himself
@Theresa19260346 @NLbdsbruno010 @ABC Not sure it's even the rich actually doing the screaming.
@CNanceAnnouncer @AlexRoseNews @KDVR @aurorak12 Agree, remember as kids we fought with knives in our pockets then made up without ever pulling them
@NLbdsbruno010 @ABC Yes and they control it through tax supported government managed programs
@CNanceAnnouncer @EAA @wingsmuseum @Sportys Enjoying the conversation about guns.  Think we are closer than you might think
@CNanceAnnouncer @AlexRoseNews @KDVR @aurorak12 You are right about that.  What brought us to where we need to solve arguments with a gun.
@jarberwok @KamalaHarris That is a gross misrepresentation.  NRA donates more that what you say in a single year
@NLbdsbruno010 @ABC Political economically they call that socialism... our ridiculous political conversation continues to confuse the issue
@CNanceAnnouncer @AlexRoseNews @KDVR @aurorak12 Keep dreaming and denying.  I'm a damned gun owner and tired of the apologists defending craziness killing so many
@rodfield @thehill They all do it but I'm amazed at the lying dribble she's forced to spout.  She will be toxic by the time it's over
@neal_katyal @ksaun001 A pretty applicable description
@amyklobuchar That would be a good place to start
@jeffzeleny @missb62 Love her realistic practicality
When he talks of a coup attempt we sound like a third world country
@CNNPolitics I do in return for a commitment to a specific service to the country
@MrDane1982 Ann Murrey's greatest hits
@ABC Might want to ask the Scandinavians their opinion
@ProudResister @ksaun001 @GOP @realDonaldTrump Some might call it an oxymoron
@RMac18 @joncoopertweets What an idiot
@thehill Sanders had the audacity to say it was a show of respect.
@CNanceAnnouncer @AlexRoseNews @KDVR @aurorak12 Sure as hell didn't have to end with a bullet
@charliekirk11 Decent point - I am a fan of compassionate democratic capitalism not the selfish brand Trump and his cronies pitch
@MKGenest Lion King by far
@politico They need to act as responsibly as they can to press them into a corner and expose them
@SharpAuthor I play one poorly
@KamalaHarris The fear is that NRA money can defeat them with at gun toting republican base
@CNN You should take it seriously... so many of his supporters are gun toting nuts
@KDVR @cubuffs Just another example of needless gun violence
@NPR He may stay but he has no credibilty
@AlexRoseNews @KDVR @aurorak12 Just another needless tragedy that only happened because a gun was present
@neeratanden @joann_cubberly This will be criminal if this election isn't overturned
@coleyworld She is a laughable joke.  Not sure she can even take herself seriously
@byMorganWright #StoryTeller
@chrisvanderveen BTW... we all should remain highly suspicious of Clark  (LOL)  Like best about him is after 3 years I still can't be sure of his politics.   :))
@krassenstein @LaneZane1 Yeah... tell me what did the polls say on election day in 2016!  Beware the hidden Trumpet and have a platform to attack that's acceptable to the middle America silent minority
@DickieV @Rick_Pitino He's a pathetic crook. not even close to The General!
@realDonaldTrump @_RainyDayWoman @foxandfriends Nope... just a what if discussion in response to a moron who listens to nobody but Rush and Ann
@BetteMidler Unfortunately we do, just the wrong one.
@BillKristol @SocialPowerOne1 @realDonaldTrump Nope but McCabe sounds credible
@thomaskaine5 @joan80313 They use divisive politics like religion, fear of socialism, abortion, immigration, guns, no more taxes to hide the retrogressive truth of their policies
@politico Nationwide blue wave in 2020?
@jeremyjojola @KristenAguirre @RyanHaarer @Jordan_Chavez Gotta have somebody to control Clark...
@JuddLegum @joncoopertweets This guy is a true danger to American democracy... just doesn't care so long as he gets his way
@KikiAdine @bjcreigh Guess she just blasted him and his nationalist ideas
@chrisvanderveen I'm convinced the majority of thinking folks still trust a hard working media does regardless what Trump says
@joncoopertweets Good reason... refusal of funds from the branch of government tasked with deciding them does not constitute a national emergency
@peterdaou @LindseyGrahamSC His opinion was far different when Obama was president
@MikeKlis We shall see between the lines... a bridge to the future they paid near nothing for
@KamalaHarris Voter suppression is one of the true issues of our time and a continued threat to the credibility of our democracy
@politico Frankly his time has passed... called yesterdays news
@realDonaldTrump What a sham and so dangerous.
@MSNBC Narcistic idiot
@EdKrassen @ChuckGrassley @marcorubio @JohnCornyn @SenatorCollins @SenRonJohnson @senatemajldr @lisamurkowski And why would we be surprised
@nickiknowsnada And why they are bitches or baby killers
@NBCNews Hmmm... guess his customers voted where they stand with their pocketbooks
@tedlieu @realDonaldTrump @nbcsnl They always chase the low hanging fruit
@politico Wish that were true he has no influence
@byMorganWright Just follow the flow and see where it goes
@SilverAdie More proof if true the guy is a selfish moron
@joncoopertweets How could it when there are no legitimate arguments that make the realistic case without adding a bunch of lies
@SocialPowerOne1 What an F...ing idiot.
@funder It would be funny or just sad if not so dangerous
@Jim_Jordan Hmmm... maybe they know something the others don't
@FranncescaRobi1 @saltymom51 @Billy_Ray28 @TeaSippingBarb @tizzywoman @realdebfarmer @Spartan2dn @MadelyneRants @remain_Hopeful @electroboyusa @CaptainResists Nah makes you normal
@HernandezVegeta Every one of those guys should be put in solitary for a month
@joncoopertweets Wow... shocking
@EdKrassen What is it that Trump welds over his head.  Has to be something.  No politician swings that drastically without good reason
A great wonderful man who will be missed by so many here in Colorado and across the country https://t.co/sjz2y71LU8
@BillKristol Let's see where the twerp stands when the chips are played... got another weasel in Gardner here in Colorado trying to play both sides
@SilverAdie @mjbeegood Saw the bio movie RBG a while back... what a powerful woman
@leeleeb50 Somebody will get burned
@amyewalter He might survive it to get reelected but will be a disaster for republicans in general
@MikeKlis Class guy... hope he lands well
@EdKrassen He might have already killed his case by saying he really didn't need to do it - contrary to the very idea and nature of an actual emergency
@SenGillibrand Unless they are double figures they hardly even make the news anymore
@AOC For profit prisons are one of the evils of our time
@thelaceylondon Damn that is really good
@SenatorBennet Very very true... we might truly live to regret this
Should we start a pool on how long it takes the next democratic president to declare a national emergency over gun violence?
@RepAdamSchiff Hmmm... the emergency is we are impatient to get our way... a true spoiled selfish brat we have as our president
@funder Wish somebody would put a gag in his mouth and leave it there
@d_waggett Cool
@nickiknowsnada Man I feel sorry for the poor guy.  Maybe he can use some of the millions he either robbed or defrauded
@HuffPostPol Would just say misquoted or fake news
@EdKrassen I too will celebrate all but the selfish ingrate
@funder Hope the elitist retrogressive do get their butts kicked out
If McConnell supports calling a national emergency over the wall he's just as much a menace to our democracy as Trump.  I think it's a calculated move to get reelected in a red neck state
What a can of worms Trump is opening.  You turn naming a national emergency into a political weapon and who knows what comes next.  This guy truly is a danger to our democracy
@RWPUSA ?????
@Kwish50086850 @RepAdamSchiff Not exactly the way our system is designed to work
@RepAdamSchiff Bind it all up in the courts and screw the moron.
@jillythomas @nickiknowsnada Maybe they simply thought he deserved the job
@sbaxter777 @JeffreyGuterman @AOC And how do diehard republicans differ
@AdrienneLaF @TheAtlantic Bob Woodward's book Fear documents the craziness
Clayton is my 96 year old father in law who was the pilot of a B-17 bomber in WWII who got shot down over Germany and made a prisoner of war.  His is a great story about what those brave guys went through
@Browns This is just anther example where one with marketable talent can get away with despicable even criminal acts with no more than a slap on the wrist.
If you want to read about a real live war hero... check out Flying the B-17 Flying Fortress:   The WW2 Memories and Experiences of 1st Lt. Clayton Nattier available on https://t.co/6nDaslTyEl
@SenWarren Good riddance!
@AngelaBelcamino @realDonaldTrump CAN'T SAY IT IN POLITE COMPANY... BUT INITIALS ARE.... F. O.!
@QuancyClayborne Go Home!
@Barbaradye921 She should be reported to the administration and the local press... this is political intimidation in it's worst form
@GiffordsCourage Way to go states... where's the leadership from congress..?  Oh yes it's mired in NRA lies and intimidation
@SenJeffMerkley He's wrong... precedent was established during Nixon
@ewarren @kbrunocrafts Every time T Jr. opens his mouth you find out what a Bozo he is
@Amy_Siskind @sadiewix No big deal... been done by virtually every modern president... let's worry about the important stuff
@lauren_hoggs Keep fighting in her memory!
@ESanders_10 @1043TheFan Smart manager of the game... how are the legs and right arm?
@CillizzaCNN @mshopemac Typical of presidents.  Eisenhower had a short par 3 hole installed in yard and another had a bowling alley put in
@thehill Classic case of stubbing your toe.
@JeffreyGuterman @AOC Not a Mr. T supporter but why would you block them.  Honest discourse is the only way out of this mess assuming you don't believe that only liberals have the answers or right to enter the discussion.
@AOC Disgusting on one hand but a chance for some much need bucks on the other.
@kasie Why is it you have to support Israel to not be called anti-semitic?
@joncoopertweets She's a selfish bitch only concerned about her multi-million dollar media revenue stream
@KamalaHarris There also needs to be more help to avoid the alienation so many feel
@politico Good... fair game.
@BarackObama @RealBillRussell Mr. Russell the real deal on and off the court
@bstokley14 @TheKylerMurray I like Haskins from OSU.  As a Hoosier it pains me to say it
@RepAdamSchiff Don't think he cares so long as he speaks to his base
@mommamia1217 So true!
@PressSec The connection is what....?
@GaryParrishCBS Any time Kentucky loses is a good day
@KyleClark @denverpost @ehernandez @BySajaHindi Typical intimidation strategy
@thehill Oh yes the ole fake news ploy
@EdKrassen Typical republican retrogressives
@washingtonpost We'll see about that at crunch time
@AOC But little care do the retrogressives in the senate
@KamalaHarris Racial profiling alive and well
@joncoopertweets What a clown... as if that matters
@dr_tonyiton @HumanImpact_HIP When you add all together federal, state, local, sales, real estate, gas, fees, etc. our rate isn't all that low but what we receive for is underachieving.
@thehill Smart political move on his part... no chance in hell it will pass but be first shot in 2020 campaign to label all dems as radical socialists
@NBCNews That will be the day... remember they are the enemy of the people according to him
@thehill The dumbass would turn and shoot if it failed follow every command
@dcarter0515 @thehill @DonaldJTrumpJr Nah... been in the gutter from the beginning
@thehill @DonaldJTrumpJr Imagine how you can ruin a total reasonable idea by being an idiot puppet who can only mimic dad
Hello twitter nation, my name is Thom Mindala who is a published author of over 40 books who lives in Denver CO who loves the outdoors, is opinionated, loves Beagles and the Hoosiers
@politico Hmmm... how bout the racist tweets
@TheDemCoalition @DonaldJTrumpJr Jr. is a knockdown entitled spoiled brat idiot.
@HuffPostPol Only if he does for being only the president for his base which represents only 30% of voters and less than 20% of Americans.
@politico Just watch they will cave
@thehill The very least he's a closet racist which is actually worse than the open blatant type
@nickiknowsnada It does... saw it my entire career
@washingtonpost The level of their intelligence
@maggieNYT Actually Webster's dates entries of words into the language.
@AOC @washingtonpost A rich uneducated baffoon who thinks he has all the answers
@KyleClark Only means he wants to stay neutral
@HuffPostPol An argument against the state of Israel doesn't make you anti-Jewish just against zionism
@KikiAdine @ericsmithw @nickiknowsnada @FranncescaRobi1 Taking care of at risk and people of need is not radical
Know what... until they get their heads out of the sandy ground I'm choosing to call republicans "Retrogressives" or the "Rollback Party"  Want to join me?
@joncoopertweets Won't hear it from any of the retrogressive republicans
@NBCNews She's my front runner so far... A pragmatic reasonable nonpartisan approach to legislation and government
@KamalaHarris Good luck with the Retrogressives on the other side
@Joyride47216923 @DonaldJTrumpJr Trump will just call it fake news then triple his own claim
@tsracewife @SenGillibrand Get real!  Not even close.  Couldn't carry Washington, Adams, Jefferson, Lincoln, Grant, Teddy R., FDR, Truman's shoe strings just to name a few.
@KamalaHarris Make going green profitable and they will jump on the bandwagon for sure
@GShapiro9News GO TEACHERS!
@joncoopertweets The local guys and gals work really hard
@EdKrassen Sounds a lot like me if you add pro technology and pro earth
@SenCoryGardner Are you sure your retrogressive buddies on the right side of the aisle will go along?
Let's go get it! Looking for 300 followers... you follow me and I will you! Let's share some ideas about writing, reading, politics, space, cycling, and fly fishing... oh and go Hoosiers!!
@amyklobuchar @dcarter0515 Maybe both Trump and congress should listen
@DanRather @dcarter0515 Unfortunately they aren't ignored by 35% of our neighbors
@realDonaldTrump @POTUS Aren't we all
@KamalaHarris Choice is simple... either open our eyes or keep our head buried in the sand
@SenGillibrand I think they will when provided positive leadership.  Trump represents our worst selves
@realDonaldTrump Should we fact check this
@R_R_Gardner @Shareblue I agree... always seems to waffle then mostly go with her caucus
@SocialPowerOne1 Consider the source.  Her dad should be in prison.
@Alt_Med_Runner @straasburg @ThomasSGN @chris_klosowski @realDonaldTrump Wow tough talk.  So that must make me a moron.  Can't imagine what that makes a Trump supporter.  Go Michael Bloomberg!
@realDonaldTrump She's the least of your problems
@dcarter0515 Why should he read?  Already said he knows it all and is smarter than anybody else.
@KylieBearseWX Hate antonyms nothing but secret codes... tell me what MBC means.
@straasburg Thus the conundrum and why God is a myth
@SocialPowerOne1 Nice reach to create workability.  N o surprise... his way or the high way.
@EricHolder Yeah... sorta the way republicans froth at the mouth when the name Clinton comes up
Can't believe the audacity of the republicans to dare complain about how Barr and Wheeler were treated after what they pulled during the Obama years
@EricHolder Republicans have nothing to complain about
@timkaine Absolutely should these are criminal issues
@Shareblue Collins has never been what she claims or wants us to think
@JonLionFineArt Tough woman
If the DEMS move too far left in their politics in an expanded primary fight they risk reelecting Trump.
@nowthisnews Somebody needs to defend them
@NPR Empower them to achieve
@SenCoryGardner @denbizjournal @SenatorBennet We beer lovers salute you
@peegs Damn
@nickiknowsnada @FranncescaRobi1 They better be careful... go too far left too fast will mean 4 more years of Trump
@starsandstripes Time to get serious and once and for all kill the abusive culture
@ProudResister Hmmm... you think?
@ChrisMurphyCT @AOC @SenMarkey We need to get back in the ballgame
@peegs Side to side, skip pass, in out... and movement to beat the zone
@DavidAFrench It's a good one.  But you gotta love Dr. Strangelove
@nowthisnews Guys a moron
@jeremyjojola Well yeah!
@BitdefenderBOX This is simple... anything "smart" can be hacked
@MileHighReport @johnelway They need an enforcer
@EdKrassen Don't know if simple majority is the number but change is needed
@insidethehall They are really struggling.
@EdKrassen Good luck... never be signed
@KyleClark I just want commercials that I can actually figure out what they are selling or why I might want to buy it
@leeleeb50 Only matters if you think you should hold her to the same standard you did with somebody else who did a stupid or insensitive thing in their past.
@SenSchumer @staceyabrams Thought she was mighty impressive... future VP candidate maybe
@SocialPowerOne1 Got to be kidding... must be joking.
@politico Just another fox in the chicken coop... what a mockery
@funder @realDonaldTrump Gotta know what the sleezes are doing
@GShapiro9News Commercials had to be better than the game
@ACLU Criminal and inhumane
@thehill Having the right and being right are far different
@KassandraSeven Frederick Douglas and MLK would be mine
@peterboykin Because he hayes everybody you didn't list
Should we shoot for 200 followers?  Follow me and I will follow you	  Admittedly concerned and upset with current politics but open to varied ideas and opinions.
@bryanbehar He's a fucking dweeb who doesn't know how to tell the truth
@VicLombardi Not just an icon but a really good and generous man.  I upset him once by accusing him of a bad call costing my Hoosiers a national championship.  But a few years later he saw me in a restaurant, said he thought he knew me, then proceeded to give me advice for coaching baseball
@EdKrassen It sucked
@leeleeb50 Wouldn't surprise me
@clevetidwellusa @axios @alexi @jonathanvswan Might be because it's true
@madwest45 @realDonaldTrump Yep working like the devil at his golf course.
I would predict that if Trump signed on Steve Bannon again in 2020 to run his campaign he would win.  Let's hope that doesn't happen.
@ZachOsterman @LFCAtlanta @StephenEvans75 Amd why weren't they playing today?
@StephenEvans75 For sure
@SenJeffMerkley He damned well should or be forced out
@MikeKlis Well deserved in both cases
@VicLombardi A rarity who was good at 3 things - referee, coach, radio host
@MikeKlis What a great guy.  Gave me some great advice as a little league coach but I did beat him up saying he cost my Hoosiers the national championship in 1971
@SenCoryGardner Good ole Velveeta... unhealthy but tasty food of champions
@insidethehall NO
@joncoopertweets Yes sir and his damned wall will be tied up in the courts and never built
@EdKrassen Well of course where is the hypocrisy they would say.  The good guys on one side (red hats) and scum on the other.
@ccallentini Love that upbeat movie
@joncoopertweets Wow blasted by his base.  He's in a real corner now.
@CoryBooker Like it
@SpeakerPelosi Typical republican solution
@RepAdamSchiff We find ourselves in the amazing cruxst of the problem.
@NewsHour We have not... a negative solution to a sociedal problem.
@EdKrassen Not so sure
@SenSchumer @realDonaldTrump This is true
@NBCNews Why should she offer any more?  His ball game and goose he's cooked by claiming pride in shutting the gov't. down.
@SenGillibrand Thank you!
@SenSchumer A true renaissance man to admire
@PoliticalEmilia Keep your head up and stress the positive... believe it or not more of it than bad regardless what the media reports
@RepMarkMeadows Why should they.  Politically they have nothing to gain
@OMGno2trump Gay men and women and anybody who dares question him
@thehill Who could ever take her seriously
@JDaIey Control your emotions
@RepAdamSchiff Pretty scary situation
@NBCNews Love it
@sahilkapur @RepMarkMeadows @AOC The way they operate you would think they were
@staceyabrams Wonderful choice.  Look forward to it
@TheRickWilson Would be reason to cheer if he did
@Broncos @NFL Well deserved.  Hope he gets in
@RonMcBride3 Would be a joke if it we're that some gullible fools will actually do it
@mitchellreports @NBCNightlyNews A scary situation if you care any for our real security
@nytimes It can be called climate radicalism and it doesn't care a lick if we believe it or not
@KarenAttiah @RacoonSquadron @JussieSmollett Mr. T has never condemned any of the violence perpetrated by his MAGA hat wearers.  Let that sink in
@SouthernProud77 @charliekirk11 @realDonaldTrump AND IF YOU DON'T YOU CAN FIRE HIS SORRY BUTT.
@Sarah_SKG_1983 Mayne he's a carefully placed Trump mole
@KamalaHarris We the only advanced industrial country without it.  Keep in mind that all who ate arguing against it have comfortable insurance plans
@KamalaHarris Yes we do!
@realDonaldTrump Maybe you should ask a climate scientist
@joncoopertweets Maybe the Dems should just let dead dogs die and focus on the real game
@EdKrassen He's lost his credibility so who cares
@SocialPowerOne1 Dobbs is a self serving moron
@stevesilberman @44vreiki And gee in the midst of it all the real threats are being ignored
@libbycwatson @JStein_WaPo @adamslily I love the idea of shoving the insurance conglomerates to the sidelines
@joshgreenman @44vreiki Real bad with worse timing
@andrewzimmern @44vreiki If true should trigger an investigation
@RedTRaccoon @44vreiki @RollingStone Not much chance so long as China pulls the strings
@MollyJongFast An unemployed multi- millionaire made off our backs
@KamalaHarris So true - the real strength of America
@RicWilson @joncoopertweets Should be prosecuted to length of the law - president's meanness has brought the worst of us out of the closet
@joncoopertweets Sadly not that much of a surprise
@HuffPostPol My bet is the guy counted on it
@joncoopertweets Perfect wat to get Trump reelected
@thelaceylondon Damn she really concerned bout it!
@AmbassadorRice I will be only if she carries through and doesn't
@AmbassadorRice Sounds like her usual song - quibble - waffle - support
@RealRussBaker @SocialPowerOne1 Have sacrificed so much - LOL
This is how your Republican lawmakers are watching out for you https://t.co/j4Kz2ExHEz
@SocialPowerOne1 Right on schedule
@ElisabethRappe @GShapiro9News @9NEWS Phoebe is "Boo Boo" https://t.co/2L1TjZP22q
@EdKrassen How silly can you get to dumb ourselves down?
@NewsHour @JudyWoodruff @SenatorCollins Seems like she always voices concern, then waffles, then makes excuse to support him
@NewsHour @JudyWoodruff @SenatorCollins Nice dodge
@SocialPowerOne1 Carlson is a fool
@Broncos @ProFootballHOF Sounds like a good hire
@SocialPowerOne1 We could only hope
@MSNBC Only if your puppeteer is willing to actually willing to negotiate instead of throwing tantrums to get his way
@EdKrassen Yeah for her
@realDonaldTrump Didn't sound so low level to me, and doesn't sound boring either, a real soap opera.
@NFLOfficiating You guys have a lot to do to restore credibilty
@HuffPostPol Can do nothing but help Trump and hurt his competition
A great day is when you can ignore all the crazy nonsense in the world and do something good and productive that helps others.
@Julia_Kimball_ @DianeMaze0 In France they aren't
@SenSchumer A day all should watch Schindler's List
@KylieBearseWX I failed my 1st drivers license test because I couldn't parallel park
@thehill What a crass joke
@EdKrassen Mueller works for the a Attorney General not congress
@senatemajldr Depends on whether they make sense don't you think?
@washingtonpost Attack on multi-culturalism
@KyleClark Yeah...!
@EdKrassen @CNN @MSNBC So...?
@psychdr100 An entitled spoiled puppet
@SocialPowerOne1 Who gives a damn what he thinks
@choosemycareorg Can offer options in single payer that would address varied needs
@HuffPostPol This is simple math that can be calculated and verified
@PressSec @realDonaldTrump If he does his precious wall will die in the courts
@annalecta @KenDilanianNBC @strickdc @PeterAlexander This a bit scary.
@JohnJHarwood @missb62 Sure seems to be making the country great again
@nytimes All great quality men according to Trump when elected
@washingtonpost Guys an elitist jerk
@SenGillibrand @AOC She looks like she might be able to play
@washingtonpost They hate... most calling her a b....h
@nexton9news Classic example of suppression of freedom of speech
@Jim_Jordan @SpeakerPelosi @SenSchumer If he does that your wall will die in the courts
@Jim_Jordan @SpeakerPelosi @SenSchumer So negotiate in your mind is nothing short of building the wall. Hmmm...
@MSNBC Isn't it though.  But didn't he once call them all quality people?
@EdKrassen Hmmm... let's see, maybe 497 and counting?
@SocialPowerOne1 A total worthless joke of a human being
@jeremyjojola Never Ending Love and Yesterday
@amyewalter Nah the real thing is far better.  Couldn't come up with better fiction if you tried
@SenatorBennet @realDonaldTrump Joke comes to mind
@EricHolder She is a force for sure.
@Juliesc51073985 @SugarP1ne7 @thehill I do hate Trump and all he represents.  Not a liberal either.  Might distrust those guys even more
@Juliesc51073985 @SugarP1ne7 @thehill Turn about is fair play
@NPR That new governor doesn't mess around
@EmilyRPeck @HuffPost @HuffPostPol They are at that!  She's Bernie on steroids
@StopTrump2020 Selfish moronic bully
@DenverChannel They can but the uproar might not be worth it
@Juliesc51073985 @thehill Iy's all about the senate not the house, so McConnell and renegade republicans are the key
@SugarP1ne7 @Juliesc51073985 @thehill Have to have guaranteed 60 votes to override a Presidents veto
@thehill What a selfish dork
@ginmoeller2 @charliekirk11 @realDonaldTrump Try to ALWAYS DO SO!  How's that for a screaming tweet response.  :))
@thehill Interesting comparison
@amyewalter No good end on this for Trump
@RedTRaccoon What an elitist bastard with his head in the ground
@SenGillibrand Another example of letting the fox in the chicken coop
@thehill Actually she held all the cards
@MikeKlis Hope Broncos don't waste a top pick to reach for a less than stellar group of prospects
@Jim_Jordan @SpeakerPelosi Maybe Mr. T could also start to focus on what's best for the country
@EricHolder Hell of an accomplishment if you just look at it from a selfish political point of view
One of the great men of the 20th century https://t.co/p4OFmdx6ed
@thehill Leaving NATO would hand Europe to Russia
@charliekirk11 @realDonaldTrump When did Trump ever state facts... that would be a new experience
@realDonaldTrump What I lie.  Only an idiot believes this.
@HuffPostPol Stupid... he should get a chance to tell his side of the story
@PoliticalEmilia Darned right... where's the outcry?
@washingtonpost These kids need to be suspended to send a message
@politico They are the ones forcing the shutdown
@PoliticalEmilia I agree totally.  They and all them like them are the real threat to our great democracy.
@joncoopertweets They should at least be severely punished
@EdKrassen Works quite well in a lot of places
@krassenstein More lies and sensationalism isn't even close to the solution
@MSNBC Sorry don't trust MSNBC any more than I trust FOX News
@washingtonpost Only he knows
@AOC The tip of the sword
@washingtonpost Surprised he did burgers instead of fried chicken
@washingtonpost That was my thought
@krassenstein About time
@NewsHour @juliagulia49 @MainePublic Cool
@MSNBC Verification is key
@MSNBC Verification... verification... verification!
@jaketapper @DonaldJTrumpJr Yes many were
@DonaldJTrumpJr You have every right to request that.  PBS sure did
@ArbolMarket I worked my whole career in construction related business so can tell you weather sure as hell affects business
@krassenstein She will move with great caution
@washingtonpost You have to wonder
@thehill She seems the outspoken star of the freshman class so far
@SenCoryGardner @schotts I would like to hear more details of this
@krassenstein You need to be careful with sensationalized unsubstantiated reports.
@washingtonpost I believe them over buzz feed news
@HuffPostPol This is a perfect example of fake or exaggerated news that only hurts the siruation
@MikkiLe52457559 Too many are in government
@thehill Uncalled for. Any who do this sort of thing should be censured
@SenatorDurbin Trump puppet
@SenSchumer @senatemajldr @realDonaldTrump They will when their own base threatens with their votes
@SenFeinstein Typical republican policy
@realDonaldTrump @seanhannity These are absolute falsehoods... how dare you!
@HuffPostPol A mutual admiration lovefest
@RedTRaccoon Typical entitled arrogant scum
@washingtonpost We can only hope they will improve things
@realDonaldTrump When did you ever care?
@DanRather How our system works
@ProudResister @Franktheshank88 @SpeakerPelosi He just might be.  Won't cave like his wimpy Republican buddies
@SenJoniErnst They already don't
@HuffPostPol A loose cannon
@nytimes Reminds me of the old title:  The Ugly Americans
@psychdr100 @YahooNews Typical government financial solution
@SenSchumer @realDonaldTrump You might as well be talking to his precious wall
@psychdr100 Let him give his SOTU speech in a closet... was going to be a pack of lies anyway
Cruz is an idiot... a whole lot of folks care https://t.co/TOqJc3ZA14
@AP Hmmm... thought ISIS was dead.  Mr. T said so
@EdKrassen Anybody with class would have refused
@EdKrassen Hmmm... let me guess
@thehill Correct but there is an initial perpetrator who set it in motion and set the terms
@SocialPowerOne1 Probably want to bring back brown shirts to replace them
@SocialPowerOne1 When somebody walks, talks, acts like a "duck" guess what he's a "duck"
@nytimes They should be prosecuted
@VicLombardi He was just being coy
@thehill Hope you're right because he isn't getting his damned wall
@SenGillibrand It's a start
@AOC Who should be surprised.  A selfish puppet
@HuffPostPol That's a fact for sure
@SenSchumer @realDonaldTrump He's not interested in negotiating.. only submission.  Classic bully.
@SenatorCollins Not if your president continues to obstruct
RT @krassenstein: After Teresa May's defeat this evening on Brexit, I have a word to my British friends.		Leaving the EU hands a victory to…
@krassenstein I agree
@SenFeinstein He sounds pretty reasonable to me
@SenSchumer Buddies take care of each other
@SenatorCollins How many of your Republican buddies will troll the WH line?
@EdKrassen Not all that surprising
@psychdr100 What a waste of time.  And this is what Republican leadership wants to focus on.  A real joke.
This is my boss Phoebe https://t.co/3BYG2vhlqT
@CityJournal It's a considered future we might face if we can't find more fair equity in the American Dream
@krassenstein Sort of amazing isn't it
@KyleClark Both fine accomplishments.  One of the fine gentlemen.  BTW Kyle who won in 1987?
I love this self appraisal.  Would like to think it describes me to some degree https://t.co/a0OQlZNyPQ
@EdKrassen Know what... going to steal it  :))
@EdKrassen Interesting self appraisal
@washingtonpost Should be... he could start a war
@thehill Well at least it's all American... wish I could believe he really paid for it
@HuffPostPol What a pathetic jackass
@RedTRaccoon Dang I hate all that worry
Shooting for 150 followers... will follow you if you follow me.  Am a good guy who's curious and cares a lot about people and the world.  Have friends who are both liberal and conservative.  Love the Hoosiers, the Denver Broncos, the Denver Nuggets, and follow the Cubs for my dad
@peegs You can't have too many losses like this or they will miss the tournament again
All of them should be held accountable https://t.co/IxHDMDU09H
@insidethehall An awful loss.
@thehill What a generous guy
@JoeNBC If Iowa Republicans have any guts they will kick him out in the primary
@jeffborzello Michigan
@CBSSportsCBB Ouch!
@HuffPostPol Respectful move.  Needed to be done
@MikeKlis Wish him the best
@SocialPowerOne1 If that's what Dobbs thinks he really is an idiot
@HuffPostPol Sure no surprise there
@MikeKlis @9NEWS Good choice.  Heard Kubiak took his chips and boys to the Vikings
@RedTRaccoon @rollcall People can grow and change
@krassenstein @missb62 What a wonderful ally Mr. T is.  Sure can count on him when the chips are down.  Think about it gov't workers forced to accept charity while he eats steak and cake over a damned worthless wall.
@DesignationSix @TysonFoods I doubt they donated for that reason
@RepAdamSchiff If this is true and verifiable articles of impeachment should be considered
@RepMaxineWaters @VinnieMDiaz1 Sorry got to have prosecutable evidence
@realDonaldTrump Keep wishing
@VicLombardi I would root for the Chiefs too
@nytimes No real surprise there
@realDonaldTrump @FoxNews There really should be accountability for the blatant lies this guy tells
@SenSchumer @realDonaldTrump No surprise... remember he has a better brain than anybody
@KoryNParker @jbh2729 @MikeKlis @Broncos @casekeenum Use picks and free agents too
@jbh2729 @MikeKlis Still gotta recognize and make the cuts
@MikeKlis Good guy who deserves it
@chucktodd @SenTedCruz Why should they when he cut them off at the knees when they did before
@MSNBC Get real!
@realDonaldTrump A lie and you know it
Saw The Green Book today.  One of the best movies I've seen in a long time
@RedTRaccoon I too in Colorado am very concerned
@chucktodd @SenTedCruz How can he when it's who he is?
@MSNBC Way to get in lockstep
@SocialPowerOne1 She and any who lie should be suspended
@washingtonpost Imagine by John Lennon
@MSNBC @MaddowBlog Classic case of cutting your friends and allies off at the knees
@MSNBC @JoeNBC If they don't wake up the will implode
@tedlieu @realDonaldTrump @POTUS How can you say immigrant crossings and crime are down and take credit same time you say there's an emergency?
@Comey Perfect quote
@krassenstein I agree he's a total embrrassment
@washingtonpost Be nice if the party got its head out of the ground and came to their senses
To all who think I meant this as a good thing sorry they are pawns of the NRA https://t.co/lkUWmUYkW3
@MileHighReport Can be sure he and Elway will be on the same page
@steinheim2 @thehill He's valid until congress decides different or we elect him out of office.
@StacyLinsay @Broncos @I_CU_boy @NFL Not really judging and btw the NFL stepped up under pressure and did right by a good guy
@StacyLinsay @Broncos @I_CU_boy @NFL Minimum salary for NFL rookies is $475,000
@SocialPowerOne1 He actually stuck to the script
@CNNPolitics Nothing more than a drill down on major campaign promise.  His base is thrilled.
@VicLombardi You think?  :))
@MileHighReport @WCGridiron Tough no nonsense guy
@SocialPowerOne1 Sorry the constitution calls for freedom of all religions not just one
@MikeKlis I vote stay with current. bite the bullet and stock up role players - OL - in this year's draft then do what it takes to get the kid from Alabama in 2020
@GiffordsCourage No go in the Senate.
@SocialPowerOne1 Bar is so low it's not saying much
@NBCNews Hope she spends some time in jail
@NewsHour What a weasel
@timkaine Hell no he's the president's puppet
@thehill He needs to tread lightly here or be legally exposed by the courts as the liar he is
@Broncos @I_CU_boy @NFL Sorry guys but a guy who makes $500K a year can afford a trip to Florida
@SenCoryGardner @GovofCO @hickforco Would like to see that be true
@AOC Don't seemed to be so worried about drunken groping or abusing women
@earthinspace @wildlife4life @HuffPostPol The DEMS must come up with practical solutions that make them a viable option to the current administration
@GGEastLDN @KathySabine9 Actually he did
@Mikeybcali @KathySabine9 Is that true or were they comments from long ago her regrets?
@ericswalwell Wouldn't wish for the first but dearly hope for the last
@thehill She makes some interesting points to consider.
@RepAdamSchiff Actually he does have constitutional power to declare an emergency while congress gets to decide whether to fund any action as a result
@GShapiro9News @KyleClark So sorry you feel that way
Wow... a hundred followers.  Yeah!
Thank you for helping me reach 100 followers! I literally couldn’t have done it without you.
@steinheim2 @thehill Actually they are sort of obligated as he is the president
@thehill What's it say about biased press as Trump claims if they refuse
@AOC Couldn't agree more with this
@KyleClark @cologop Get real... they are silent on their president's actions and comments
@HuffPost YES!  We want to see regular exciting people representing us
@lisastark351 @dcarter0515 @GOP Why wonder.. we know why... the give little damn about regular people
@d_toenacious Greatest election of all time?  PA...LEASE!!
@d_toenacious @realDonaldTrump @BarackObama Bet he's keeping track
@d_toenacious Agree... should have to live the consequences of their decisions
@MSNBC I like all lives matter as compared to all lives matter regardless color or background
@RedTRaccoon @VinnieMDiaz1 Thay's for sure!
@nytimes Good example of how modern government woeks
@RawStory @missb62 Now that is truly democracy in action
@MSNBC We should... sorry a false argument that weakens your position.
@HuffPostPol Doesn't at all make it acceptable.  We diminish our argument when we lower to his level
@Newsweek A few nervous republicans even starting to break ranks.
@idsnews Does their CEO still make millions and live in a mansion?
@MSNBC @maddow Some might call that an ill informed idiot or the bamboozled
@thehill Gee... and his boys have the majority
@NewsHour @LisaDNews She won't play Trumps game
@funder @missb62 Talk about falling off the soapbox before you ever get on!
@CBSThisMorning This is more like a representative of the people should act and say not some profanity laced diatribe
@PhilipRucker Still a ways to go
@TheValuesVoter @thehill An excellent point
@Chunkybearold @EdMahalick @thehill @ItsKevinMangold No surprise there... it's what political parties are designed for
@SenSchumer @realDonaldTrump No chance of that so long as he has nothing to give his base
@davey914 @AMarch4OurLives Wee guess what maybe if one were done one of these mass shooters would be stopped... but of course that is a high price to pay to save a few lives
@Rvndave @NBCNews This gal is an AMERICAN elected to congress not some foreign hater.
@RepAdamSchiff @HernandezVegeta You're talking into a black hole.  The man is a coward
@TOMCRUMLEY1951 @thehill When one comes out with a profane rant that's not exactly positive
@SenSchumer @realDonaldTrump Good luck with that
@CNNPolitics Where is he when he could play a positive role
@HuffPost @MSignorile Doesn't excuse it or make it effective
@NBCNews What a sad start for one who could have been such a positive example for young muslim women and girls
@AMarch4OurLives Sadly will never pass the senate
@NewsHour @nytdavidbrooks I agree totally.
@siano2020 @HernandezVegeta It's not.
@Newsweek No help at all lowering to Trump's level
@Newsweek What a sad example of decorum from one elected by the people.
@HuffPostPol Fake news...
@HuffPostPol Wait until the checks stop coming.  Checked TSA sick calls lately?
@9NEWSSports He sure as hell would
@ByJonHeath @MikeKlis I'm not sure I wouldn't at least explore it
@washingtonpost He sure as hell should have
@washingtonpost Seems to never end women being used and abused
@GShapiro9News So long Hick
@realDonaldTrump That's BS and you know it, but it's a great selling point.
@thehill Sorta like you guys did with Obama?
@thehill Wait til the lawsuits start
@TOMCRUMLEY1951 @thehill Blaming the past is no defense for the now
@dabeard @missb62 Good for everybody if they went bankrupt
@joanwalsh @SocialPowerOne1 Flake and Corker are cowards who bolted and ran
@NBCNews What a discussion, all they heard was another tantrum that if he doesn't get total funding for his wall he will take his toys and go home.
@tedlieu @realDonaldTrump Yep hope he doesn't turn out like Flake the Fake
@medbob @DWStweets Maybe a return to old west not a horrible idea as it sounds.  But gun violence MUST be attacked with unimpeachable penalties
@VicLombardi Hope not
@thehill Needs to be compromise.  Dems being obstructive for political reasons
@MileHighReport New England's defensive coordinator
@washingtonpost Syria a can't win situation
@GaryParrishCBS UCLA is a coach killer
@MikeKlis Hang in there... you will
@GShapiro9News Help DACA kids!
@MileHighReport Huge loss
@NBCNews Go...!
@realDonaldTrump Not sure I disagree
@MileHighReport Hmmm... not so sure
@MileHighReport I sure hope not
@KylieBearseWX Why... she's being stupid
@realDonaldTrump Hate to say it but you are right
@PoliticalEmilia Will drive the discussion for the middle class
@PoliticalEmilia I like it but her time might have passed
@thehill It has... give the damned thing to him and take the issue off his plate
@MileHighReport A blast to the past?
@KyleClark Good guy who will do better next time
@MileHighReport Just didn't get the job done
@MileHighReport @AdamSchefter Flores is an interesting choice.  Huge resume.
@MikeKlis Hmmm...?
@realDonaldTrump What a precious joke
@thehill Better than asking your parole officer
@realDonaldTrump All meaningless symbolism
@FAIRImmigration @LifeZette I do too!!!  Where are you Senators Bennett and Gardner?
@MileHighReport Not sure there is an improvement available
@PatriotReturn @NBCNews Agree... automated self driving cars will eventually be the answer
@Comey Will continue to do so loud and clear
@ZachOsterman Go Hoosiers
@KamalaHarris We are praying for you and demanding progress
@irkthejerk Throw the book at him
@MikeKlis @9NEWS Along with Ray and Roby
@MileHighReport Lots of problems to solve
@NBCNews Wow... and if a toy kills a few hundred we demand it get pulled of the market
@krassenstein Agree
@BarackObama Done... it just got put on my to do list.
@MikeKlis @9NEWS Probably is
@thehill You are disgusting.  They aren't pawns they are a horrid reality for a democracy
Hey all... my goal is to get to 100 followers by end of January.  So join up!
@washingtonpost I'm gonna say he's just misdirected and we can all fix it in 2020
@VicLombardi They were all at King Soopers.
@thehill Not what your boy promised dude.
@FAIRImmigration @DailyCaller @thejasonhopkins Too bad we can't add legal nuts to the list.
@MikeKlis Go corner unless a stud guard is available.  No QB  good enough to be that high
@thehill That is the sad fact of politics... you played it for 8 years under Obama
@DenverChannel Who's out there that give us a better chance?
@leeleeb50 Gutter sweeper
@MikeKlis Sorta wonder if we should hang with him.  What are the options?  Another reach or a retread.  Is McCarthy really the answer.
@leeleeb50 Porta-potty scrubber
@RepAdamSchiff Good luck trying to investigate one of the most honest people in the country
@KentuckyMBB Love it.  Got cheater program #1 playing #2.  Only time I'm glad UK wins
@KylieBearseWX Wow!  Good thing my wife didn't see it!
@chrisvanderveen Sad story never should have happened.  Influence of lobbyists prevented action for over a decade
@joshtpm Just another typical lie
@psychdr100 'Bout time somebody stood up to them
@KyleClark Sorry but I personally saw Kyle Clark bring donuts and actually act excited to be there with a bunch of paint geeks cleaning up graffiti on a cold Saturday morning.
@RealCandaceO @veteran423 Real men don't have to act the part.
@SenJeffMerkley Not about the money... but all about the symbolism
@KyleClark Imagine if there was total silence to your commentary.
@PassTheSalty These guys are truly retrogressive morons.  Only people they care about are rich white guys and the women they screw.
@JGerholdt @missb62 @EricLiptonNYT @SteveEder @JohnBranchNYT Sad reality that might take a generation to fix
@chrislhayes Are you a Russian secret agent?  I've been accused of that a time or two.   :))
@thehill Why would I be excited about that?  They are the nonsensical opposite of FOX
@thehill Big deal.  BS rule and none issue
@starsandstripes @jaketapper One more down.  We are fast losing a precious resource.
@IS3B @MikeKlis @9NEWS That's unfortunate
@Brileal13 @DyamondWithaY Actually I think a little more
@jeremyjojola Well said
@thehill And why would we care?
@SaysHummingbird Feel so sorry for the
@thehill Fine... time we got the hell out.
@PressSec How dare any question out self anointed crown prince
@thehill Only have to hope we haven't already arrived there
I find the total lack of sympathy and compassion for desperate people at risk willing to walk over a 1000 miles for a better life appalling...
@mizelldeman @RepAdamSchiff Guess you've never been desperate.
@nelsguvi @gordian2012 @thehill Is this a joke?
@thehill Hard to disagree with that
@HuffPost No surprise... the dog doesn't demand sex.  :)
@SenWarren @dcarter0515 @realDonaldTrump They do indeed on both sides of the aisle
@NBCNews But they are truly profitable to the manufacturer
@MikeKlis @9NEWS He and Ray give Broncos best chance to get value in places of need.  Who would want Kheenam's contract right now?
@HuffPostPol Maybe we should invest in more processing support rather than a stupid dysfunctional wall
@Shortbuttuff64 @RepAdamSchiff So compassionate.  The heartless attitude against those running from horrible violence sickens me.
@johnmanly @jaketapper The Pope actually claimed it was the duty of the Priests to turn themselves in.
@SUVARI84 @BenSasse You're joking... their only interest is killing Kurds
@MGrimm19 @MileHighReport The guy at OSU the only one worth a high pick for
@KyleClark Martino lost his credibility years ago.
@thehill That would be the day when they vote against their own interests
@9NEWSSports @BradRoby_1 @JasonWitten Witten one of the worst analysts I've seen in a while.  Adds nothing to the game except idiot or useless comments
@thehill @TheHillOpinion It will eventually kill our economy
@thehill Everything is a campaign rally for Trump
@cnnbrk What a fighter
@SenatorDurbin A dark blight on our country's reputation
@WorldAndScience I'm convinced they know the meaning of some
@PatrickRuffini Dick Chaney was a criminal who should be in prison.
@GShapiro9News All about who blinks first.
@NBCNews What a way to show appreciation for their service
@MikeKlis How interesting... and the constant in the organization during that time?  Just wondering.
@ProudDemResists @missb62 Donald Trump at the top closely followed by Mitch McConnell
#paintdoctor76
@RepAdamSchiff This is a horrific travesty for a country that wants to stand for good in the world.
@ktumulty @CallTheMidwife1 I just turn on Mama Mia
@thehill Won't it be truly interesting when all the tell all books come out
Know what I would let Mr. T have his damned fence. and make it a non-issue to harp on with his base.
@medbob @DWStweets I'm bothered that we want to turn schools into armed prisons.
@davidhogg111 Congrats... maybe you can follow footsteps of #44.  :)
@thehill Too bad they waited 2 1/2 years to figure that out.
@ESPNNFL @thecheckdown Class guy... more than you can say about those he plays for
@TroyRenck @jsimms1119 An a long season coming to an end with a wimper
@mitchellreports And today they announced they were hiding amongst the Kurds... the excuse begins.
@insidethehall Why did he ever take that job.  Nobody will ever live up or be good enough
@MSNBC Yet another thing for us to be proud of
@AmbassadorRice @brett_mcgurk @realDonaldTrump @BarackObama Don't you know he was merely one of the little people.
@thehill Shocked...!
@SteveStaeger Sorry I happen to appreciate Mr. Staeger
@thehill Only took 2 years to figure that out
@SWTubbs Maybe they just have tunnel vision?   (LOL)
@KyleClark Really, you were just gone for 2 weeks.  Why do I wonder if you are on your way out?   :))
@CNNPolitics Why would he ever do that when it got his predecessor fired?
@HuffPost Sounds like a typical selfish entitled white republican with a guaranteed lifetime pension
@JenGriffinFNC @MalcolmNance Typical knee jerk reaction from a dangerous idiot with no clue.  Who the hell would ever trust us?
@WajahatAli @MalcolmNance They started yesterday.  Did you hear Rush?
@FAIRImmigration @BreitbartNews @NeilMunroDC Way to go Paul.  Now want to claim you have the answers when you leave.  What a disappointment
@CityJournal That is total bullshit!
@SenJeffMerkley Disgusting and un-American
@clairecmc Good luck and thanx for your service
@nicolevap @jeremyjojola @ParkSheriff This is idiotic and the voter tax payers should be enraged.
@KDVR Let him do it.
@ABC Could you imagine Trump ever doing such a thing.  He's too busy throwing kids out of the country, putting the in kiddy prisons, or letting them die
@CBSSportsCBB Good riddance
@davidhogg111 Poor babies
@SenSchumer @realDonaldTrump Don't ya know they will pay indirectly.  What a crock!
@politico Honestly I will believe it when I see it
@MileHighReport Should be a done deal
@MGrimm19 @MileHighReport Doesn't look to me like anybody this year is a long term solution
@DWStweets I agree in the classroom.  Having trained police resource officers in specific situations does make sense as does better control over who is coming and going.  Walked into our neighborhood school the other day with barely a glance after all that's happened.... worrisome
@thehill I was too...
@BenSasse The real high fiver is Turkey who wants us to cut support to Kurds at the knees
@SenFeinstein No reason we should be surprised by that
@CNNPolitics What sniveling wimps
@RepAdamSchiff My view is it's a kick in the teeth to our Kurdish allies driven by Turkish demands
@BeschlossDC @missb62 Just read your book Presidents of War - interesting read about growth of the imperial presidency and world view far contrary to the intent of our founders
@Newsweek Only if women allow it
@AMarch4OurLives I agree its a start but barely addresses the total problem
@Archie_Miller Sad... will keep him in our thoughts
@nexton9news He sure got spanked.
@SenSchumer @senatemajldr So why are we surprised?
@johnmanly @jaketapper The Catholic hierarchy has no credibility left.
@GaryParrishCBS Wish it could happen.
@thehill Mueller might be the most unbiased and least corruptible man in government.  Think he would put his own grandmother in jail if need be.
@StephenAtHome @missb62 Hey don't forget they've been charitable to the Donald all along.
@CNNPolitics A loyal goon who doesn't mind debasing himself in public is why
@USATODAY Wow something I actually agree with him on.
@MileHighReport I'm not sure any coming out are worth a truly high pick.  They have so many other needs starting on the offensive line.
@KyleClark @SenCoryGardner So much for his opening gambit to show Coloradans he actually gives a damn about them and deserves a 2nd term in a state gone bright blue.
Had a luncheon with 3 WW2 Prisoners of War and real American heroes today.  We owe them more than we could ever pay.  Thanks to Stefan Tubbs for making it happen.
@MileHighReport So explain why that doesn't translate to wins
@WhiteHouse @PressSec @realDonaldTrump So tired of his crap
@44vreiki @SenSchumer @realDonaldTrump Maybe for a coffin for the 7 year old they killed
@SenSchumer @realDonaldTrump Nobody ever believed Mexico would pay.
@MileHighReport I can tell by the results.
@HillReporter I would almost bet my last dollar that Trump would never resign.
@VicLombardi Yes a bold move but high potential.  Chubb makes it possible
@KyleClark He'll fit right in then
@thehill Thanx for the donations eh
@cbseric @CBSDenver A little too aggressive
@SenJeffMerkley Refuse a U.S. Senator.  Makes total sense to me.  America MUST be protected from all threats
@bad_takes My god what pathetically heartless you know what
@DogginTrump How dare you think poor folks ought to have benefits from the American democracy.  Don't you know it's only meant for the rich.
@KassandraSeven White priviledge must be upheld at all cost.
@KyleClark Amazing stuff.  Can't wait to see it myself
@HillReporter I would believe that when I see it
@JeffFlake @senatemajldr @ChrisCoons @SenatorCollins @SenatorDurbin He will be missed
@SocialPowerOne1 Typical of a Trump enabler
@washingtonpost If this is true someone should go to jail
@senatemajldr Know what... don't even try to take credit
@MikeKlis Long overdue
@MileHighReport I predict we Bronco fans only have 3 more games to enjoy Mr. Joseph's comedy act.
@amyewalter A real pathetic joke on all of us is what it is.  In the day they would have been called charlatans
@ProudResister @realDonaldTrump Are you sure about the.  He was quoted on audio bragging about grabbing women's genitals and still got elected
@LindsayJoyTV @RegisJesuitHS @RJ_Media Travel to Indiana and you will see many week in and week out all across the state
@nytimes About time we disengage from this brutal religious sectarian war
@JohnKerry What a horrible stain on our image and reputation
@thehill It only happens if those in the assembly take to heart and quit prioritizing talking points to their respective base.
@MileHighReport Are we sure Mr. E can do that?  $28M to Keenum is a bit bothersome
@politico And what role did he play?
@senatemajldr @senorrinhatch Good riddance.  Utah deserves better
@SocialPowerOne1 This guy is a total joke
@krassenstein Cold and heartless
@SenatorCollins We need to cut that string
@washingtonpost His base might
@thehill A mouthpiece for her boss no more no less
@HuffPost Her credibility will be nil by the time it's over
@comedydoc9 @missb62 Follow the money and votes.  No loyalty beyond those.  If they perceive he costs them either they will dump him like a hot rock
@RealMuckmaker This is the same guy who claimed for 8 years a democratic president wasn't an American citizen
@drhume65 @jihayes1725 @nytimes And you
@KyleClark Not a hell of a lot when it mattered.  Let the one guy most likely to beat them run wild.  Another pathetic coaching job.
@marthahutson @RealMuckmaker You're damn right we care. One day there will be an accounting for Hatch and all like him
@RealMuckmaker Hell no he doesn't... only cares when the democrats do
@Newsweek Sure no political bias there
@krassenstein We'll see about that
@washingtonpost Pretty disgusting... does nothing to advance our politics only lowers to his level
@Nataya @missb62 @davidhogg111 We could only hope
@lauren_hoggs Some of our idealistic history is a lie but by no means should we quit trying
@cnnbrk Best of all worlds but only possible if Dems offer objective meaningful alternative solutions and "we hate Trump or he's a bad guy" ain't good enough.
@joncoopertweets Wouldn't that be a treat
@JoyceWhiteVance @missb62 @matthewamiller @BDGarp Despicable but no solid proof of criminality to date
@thehill Something about this doesn't seem right
@irkthejerk @davidhogg111 @NRA Thats interesting
@irkthejerk @davidhogg111 @NRA Good point.
@irkthejerk @davidhogg111 @NRA Very well might not thats why I support stronger punishment for crimes committed with them
@drhume65 @jihayes1725 @nytimes BTW... you make a good point about a chaotic scene
@drhume65 @jihayes1725 @nytimes You could be very well right.  Problem for me is it seems to happen over and over with same scenarios which seems suspicious of profiling even if not intentional.  Just an unfortunate historical reality in our country.  Thanx for not dumping me.  :)
You are absolutely right.  Feeds right into his frenzy.
@KyleClark I dare disagree.  Not a strong hops guy
@irkthejerk @davidhogg111 @NRA We need to figure out what it is that's causing so many to feel alienated
@drhume65 @jihayes1725 @nytimes Actually I'd like to hear it.
@irkthejerk @davidhogg111 @NRA How about doing real background checks on assault style weapons purchasers and allowing law enforcement to rescind right to ownership temporarily if given just and due cause.  That said guns violence doesn't end with regulation alone.  Must address issues of anger, frustration
@Newsweek Wonder if there was some reason?
@jeremyjojola @nexton9news Nice work!
@CNN No surprise there.  They are all about dirty water too
@AP_Politics She'll only be a mouthpiece.  Easy pickings for the pros in the UN.  Great choice..
@LawWorksAction @JeffFlake @SenCoryGardner McConnell will never let it happen
@MSNBC That hasn't been proven yet
@HuffPostPol Moving closer to the center
@davidhogg111 @NRA I own guns and believe in the right but there does need to responsible control
@denverpost No consequence... sounds like a plan to me
@HuffPostPol Sure fits the profile
@HuffPostPol What a pack of lies... fake news for sure
@drhume65 @jihayes1725 @nytimes If you have to as then the explanation would be obviously wasted
@RedTRaccoon He should
@HuffPost Just wondering how many of us could stand the close scrutiny of our actions and comments when we were young and dumb.
@realDonaldTrump Yes... but all in the eyes of the beholder.
@HuffPostPol If he had any class or ethics he would. but...
@HillReporter No shock there... all he's done is be loyal to them
@maydaymindy9 One can only hope.  But a viable alternative has to step up
@cleopatrapug @verizon @TMobile @JohnLegere Have always got excellent service at Verizon.  TMobile sucks
@BBCWorld Just shows that politics doesn't end at our shores
@NikkisBubble @missb62 @AriMelber He's a dweeb...
@TheBeatWithAri @missb62 @JoaquinCastrotx Hope he is the arrogant bastard
@CherylPreheim @ronjonesreports Does this mean the animal rights folks are jumping on the political correctness bandwagon
@KyleClark She just might be right
@drhume65 @jihayes1725 @nytimes That's possible.
@drhume65 @jihayes1725 @nytimes Sure he feels bad and I guess we should pray for him but the kind of profiling that caused the tragedy has to stop.
@clairecmc @hayesrw Pretty pathetic
@adamcbest Always classy
@GiffordsCourage Still a battle I bet even in their own party and no support across aisle
@rolandscahill She should be sick to her stomach she screwed up so much
@CityJournal Good luck to them
@drhume65 @jihayes1725 @nytimes It break for those shot without cause
@SocialPowerOne1 Shows how much he cares
@RealMuckmaker Good luck with that
@realDonaldTrump Hmmm... 4000 years of signals
@LawWorksAction @JeffFlake @SenCoryGardner Not much chance of that
@LawWorksAction @JeffFlake @SenCoryGardner Good luck with that.  Gardner only cares about what direction the political winds are blowing
@Acosta Nice words and appropriate to honor a life well lived
@HuffPostPol No surprise
@MileHighReport So sad
@MileHighReport Devastating on top of Harris
@GiffordsCourage Makes me even more impressed with his legacy
@HuffPost Don't feel a bit sorry for them.  Only the girls and women who depend
@MattRenoux @9NEWS @9NEWSWeather The best reporting job in Colorado
@NewsHour @ConversationUS Actually money be made by going sustainable green.  R's too dumb to figure that out.
@thehill Well what the hell.
@JWilliams3434 @nytimes They will suddenly be missing or "didn't work"
@jihayes1725 @nytimes Mine breaks for every young black man in America who must walk a tight rope in fear of being killed by the very people we hire to protect us
@BIGD088 @EvanSciNbanjo @I_amShelnik @nytimes A total sham!
@I_amShelnik @nytimes Absolutely will be the case
@nytimes Disgusting example of racist profiling in America
@danpfeiffer @missb62 The brazen nature is hard to believe.
@Dan_F_Jacobson Hard to believe the audacity
@washingtonpost You think?
@CNN Another class act
@realDonaldTrump @EmmanuelMacron Get real, Macron is no friend of yours
@senatemajldr The picture of decency... you Rs should consider the comparison
@jeremyjojola @nexton9news @9NEWS Hey this could be a step up (LOL)
@TubbsShow @SebGorka @SWTubbs @realDonaldTrump So he's tough... still would rather have a good and decent guy.
@realDonaldTrump Just give him the damned wall already
@MileHighReport I would have given them a 50 - 50 shot before the Harris injury
@washingtonpost How about a model with small boobs?
@RedTRaccoon Better specify Lyndon and not Andrew Johnson
@RedTRaccoon I'm thinking Quayle doesn't make the list.
@TheRickWilson Hey, just add it to the list of lies
@JebBush Like any loyal companion.
@midiisle We salute you sir!
@spectatorindex Way to go everybody... we made the top 10.  We should be so proud
@thehill Do they have any evidence?
@CNNPolitics Beats the hell out of the way he treated John McCain's death
@MikeKlis He's a rock star... meaning he's a stud with the rock
@SocialPowerOne1 Wow who okayed that blooper
@RedTRaccoon Probably proportionally correct which doesn't make it right or fair.
@beckyditchfield The loss of common civility in our world is staggering
@washingtonpost In all the important ways.
@gothamwriters Underline, highlight, write in margins, even dog ear...
@foe_us We are absolutely heading in the wrong direction
@9NEWS He da man for sure!
@CNNPolitics If all these terrorist leaders keep getting killed why no more progress against them?
@Ocasio2018 Out of control waste by massive military industrial complex that has choke hold on our economy
@mgranville1 Bernie's not the answer
@BrandonPerna Really lousy call.  Same with Miller before
@JamesKosur Real men support women not abuse or vilify
@MikeKlis Unfortunate news
@NBCOlympics @MikaelaShiffrin @NBCSN Way to be Colorado
@krassenstein We've become a moral dumping ground and wasteland
@OMGno2trump Could happen
@UROCKlive1 More proof that a certain percentage are morons
@CityJournal When it comes to safety issues personal freedom has no place
@psychdr100 @thinkprogress Actually its an admiration man crush
@NYTScience Well then hell they better up the price 700%
@WolfredNelson @thehill There's a no return tipping point out there where denying and pretending doesn't matter
@thehill Wow... such leadership.
@CherylPreheim @SamanthaMohrTV Jealous... low 40s here
@NYTScience @nytopinion Leave them alone
@psychdr100 We can only hope this not the case. But alas if so he would just blame the D's or Chinese
@insidethehall Decent first B10 win
@9NEWS Could be a trap
@SenatorLeahy @SenFeinstein Hope the sniveling pipsqueak goes to prison
@alshipley @missb62 Why?
@kasie A true gentleman.  A rarity in politics
@th3j35t3r Classless
@RealMuckmaker @HuffPostPol She will be unemployable and toxic when it's over
@HuffPost This is truly scary... to forget history is to repeat it
@HuffPostPol Pure class
@thehill It's all about who wags the tail
@KyleClark Wow... did I miss something?  The heroin enabler?  That's rich!
@jguer63 @KyleClark Not weird... scary as hell!
@KylieBearseWX @KyleClark DITTO!
@SteveStaeger @KyleClark @FlyFrontier A buck for each utensil
Boy would that be troubling to see at 39000 feet. https://t.co/vmnIKflgzK
@MySportsUpdate Thought they were focusing on this?
@thehill Sorry but I agree with some of what he says.  How long is a country going to get a free pass based on guilt?
@MSNBC So typical... my hero yesterday a goat today based on what direction the wind blows
@JarradOdle @espn Knight's a complicated guy.  Most good things he did at IU off the radar.  Made his players stand up and be accountable.  The record of career success of those he mentored is off the charts.  That said on a personal and political level a bit lacking
@EricHolder What a brazen attack on legislative democracy
@SocialPowerOne1 What a pathetic joke
@MileHighReport They don't beat Bengals no argument left
@SenSchumer Give him the damned wall!  Doesn't matter then could use as leverage to get other stuff
@HuffPost This is a sad blemish on a good company.
@SenFeinstein You think... how enlightening
@psychdr100 @dc_tribune Hmmm... one must wonder
@SocialPowerOne1 Hmmm... really?  Look in the mirror, your leader is a selfish moron and bully.  Hey, hey. wait to 2020!
#HeyNext Any news person disliked by both sides is obviously doing good work.  Way to go Mr. Clark.
@SenSchumer About time a pathetic candidate got shot down
@SocialPowerOne1 What jackasses
@realDonaldTrump What a pile of crap.
@mkraju Heads in the sand
@adamcbest Funny a year ago he was touted as one of country's best lawyers.  Quite the fall
@RedTRaccoon Concerns...?  We should be disgusted
@RT_com Punt
@RT_com A mad scramble
@MSNBC Edging closer
@BrendanNyhan @missb62 You have to wonder
@RVAwonk @CNN That s what happens when dealing with a spoiled child
@wvjoe911 Fuck him!
@thehill Source and verification?  Those we don't let in but what about the other 4400?
@thehill He's going to have a lot more... better move to the middle or buff up his resume
@NASAInSight We miss you in Denver
@CherylPreheim @11hullinger @KyleClark @11AliveNews All your sides are best.  Atlanta so lucky to have.  Miss your intelligent insights.
Help me reach 100 followers — I’m halfway of the way there!
@KyleClark Anonymous comments should be ignored... they are cowards
@Ocasio2018 @IlhanMN Good luck... drain the middle age white male privileged arrogant insensitive swamp
@USATODAY Why would he not
@KyleClark I would be far more in favor of the sites if they actually included medical and counseling help to get off addiction
@KyleClark I get sick and tired of idiots who portray Clark as a liberal.
@insidethehall Played young and dumb against pressure
@senatemajldr Of course you haven't gutted medicare or social security yet
@MileHighReport Of course and he should
@SocialPowerOne1 Hey... should I feel sorry for a group that voted for him by 80%?
I SAY THIS AGAIN... NOTHING HAPPENS UNTIL NRA IS HELD ACCOUNTABLE AND FORCED TO REFORM https://t.co/gXqGJYKYDJ
@CBSSportsCBB Guy is a stud.  Destroyed my beloved Hoosiers.
@AP No surprise... heck Nevada R's elected a dead guy
@CNNPolitics Might be big enough
@psychdr100 @politico Poor baby... gosh maybe we should lock her up
@krassenstein Never will until the chokehold of the NRA is broken
@NBCNews The guy has zero credibility
@washingtonpost The guy is a pathological liar
@ddale8 In support of a racist idiot
@HuffPost Gee wonder how we will vote if UN decides to condemn?
@CityJournal We will find other uses
@KyleClark I am a NEXT addict
@MileHighReport Still too many flaws
@senatemajldr You ate an archaic joke
@SocialPowerOne1 He should himself demonstrate it
@HuffPost Despicable.  We've become the heartless and selfish autocracy
@susarm @MalcolmNance How convenient
@denverpost A proactive move
@HuffPostPol Doesn't matter what he thinks, the climate doesn't care
@GMFleet Wish you were more dedicated to protecting jobs
@george_capen Yep... true enough our leader focuses on those awful dangerous people at our border while Putin continues to rape the Ukraine.
@SenBennetCO @POTUS No surprise there.
@11hullinger @KyleClark @CherylPreheim @11AliveNews We were robbed!
@SenateGOP @senatemajldr Are you living in the Twilight Zone?
@CNNPolitics Do you think?
@MikeKlis It's a trap for Bronco fans who are overreacting
@HuffPost Disgusting.  We are becoming "the fake democracy"
@SocialPowerOne1 This guy is as big a joke as Trump.  Probably claims the Insight landing is fake news
@chucktodd @SenMikeLee To hell with saving the word if it hurts our precious economy.  What idiots, so short sided and destructive.
@SenGillibrand Unfortunately the climate doesn't care if we wake up and do the right thing
@adamcbest Wish that is all he did
@MileHighReport They have grit!
@realDonaldTrump You are delusional.
@jaketapper My guess this coward will change his tune.
@davidhogg111 That'san over reach even if technically correct.  You risk losing credibility.
@brithume @IngrahamAngle It's a tax and spending issue... our budget process is a joke.
@IndianaFootball Be nice if we could beat Purdue
@erinepowell Wow!
@chucktodd @SenMikeLee Trump isn't interested in the truth
@realDonaldTrump @senatemajldr @SenSchumer I strongly agree that at least a start.  Push McConnell
@real_farmacist What a total joke.
@kevinltorres Sounds a little like NEXT
@JohnBrennan Well said
One could actually use that for opposite argument since when we came we ran off the natives and stole their land https://t.co/qviOMCEU2m
@MileHighReport Hope is eternal
@kylegriffin1 American credibility just sank to a new low
@TIME I vote for Megan
@CNN What a self centered asshole
@adamcbest The classical political fixation
@mkraju Joke for sure.
@mattmauronews @KDVR @DenverPolice What's the penalty for running from a crash?  Should make it so draconian nobody would dare.
@ADIC33 It's a right wing foaming at the mouth over the Clinton era.  And to be honest she isn't that likable in public.
@TheRickWilson No need to make this a big deal - the man creates plenty of nonsense on his own
@CNNPolitics Can you imagine the Donald doing this- LOL!
@chucktodd A majority of Americans know better.
@KyleClark My kind of sign.
@SocialPowerOne1 This woman is an absolute joke.
@SallyQYates Hard to believe.  We owe thanks to serious pro who stood up to him in defense of our constitutional processes
@kasie Still say the press should boycott... see how fast a man who can't stand not being front and center backs off.
@HuffPost What idiot would ever ruin a fine and nutritious vegetable by boiling it.
@JudicialWatch @TomFitton @realDonaldTrump Yes lets use the JD as a weaponized tool against our enemies... great idea.
@denverpost Felt so sorry for that mother with 2 sons turned out to be gangbangers, 1 dead 1 injured.  Know the helpless feeling.
@KyleClark Great news they found a new home for him
@MattRenoux Thinking about you and your wife.  Thanksgiving's the time for positive reflection and strength of family
@EricHolder Sorry Jim Crow is still alive and well in the ole white boy network
@PassTheSalty Makes me think of the match... shines bright until time for the big game
@JohnBrennan Of course we should have got him sooner.  Ask Billy C... but to blame a brave veteran who has served with honor?  Disgusting.
@RepAdamSchiff All of which makes Mr. T jealous
@SocialPowerOne1 Wonder who fired the first shots.
@HuffPost LOCK HER UP!
@politico Way to dismantle a victory.  Typical democrats
@thehill What bullshit
@amyewalter A poorly timed selfish move.
@peegs He was a steal.
@MaddowBlog @Barbara80014143 Isn't ironic that man who oversaw loss of seats in senate is safe while woman who oversaw the blue wave in the house is fighting for her life.  And they say things have changed.  I say not all that much!
@AlecMacGillis So does that mean if they got their 52% in each district they should give up some of those seats?  Ain't how it works dude.
@realDonaldTrump I actually agree.  Straight forward"reciprical" tariffs the answer
@KyleClark @jaredpolis Maybe he should talk to Mitt Romney since made the SLC olympics profitable
@senatemajldr Wonder when the last time Reps worked across aisle with Dems
@MattRenoux Hang in.  My wife diagnosed in 1992, a recurrence in '99, now been free for 19 years.
@JeffFlake Thanx for breathing some common sense into the discussion
@WmHokeWallace @chucktodd You're assuming he even cares...
@MichelleSweari5 @chucktodd The fearful, frustrated, resentful
@Leanne_Barden @Patta47cake @chucktodd Remember we are making America Great Again  -  LOL
@Leanne_Barden @chucktodd Too bad you are a blue state.  If red he would double down on federal help.
@DufusRigamaroll @NormOrnstein @chucktodd It 's what my psychologist wife has been saying about him for 3 years
@chucktodd Disgusting and embarrassing
@__CallMeBen @Amuoralzg @coldcardinal @amyewalter Thanx for pointing that out
@chucktodd @RepAdamSchiff A factual truth even though she like many have been in power too long and is part of the problem
@SenatorCollins Amen!
@PleaseGiveMe209 @TrumpWontWin @dangoss00 @mcallisternj @amyewalter @joshtpm A far different world
@TrumpWontWin @dangoss00 @mcallisternj @amyewalter @joshtpm More than absurd it's denying reality.
@JudgeHollowell @IndyMuttMom @amyewalter Well said.  We always tend to over analyze
@RedRedSuit @amyewalter @chrislhayes A true assessment
@KDbyProxy @amyewalter @chucktodd Maybe a big swing in control but no wave.  Still huge regional divisiveness and polarization
@coldcardinal @amyewalter It also involves a huge majority of state secretary of states who manage elections... ie. Georgia for example
@JonD0985 @redmondlonghorn @amyewalter @joshtpm Correct
@redmondlonghorn @amyewalter @joshtpm It's called gerrimandering districts, a game the R's have been very good at.
@AP Sure does
@KyleClark @RepMikeCoffman Absolutely despicable
@Nicoxw1 Simply amazing.  And this is how bad it's gotten
@TheRickWilson We can only hope...
@chrisvanderveen Hope you are right about that.  No hope if we can't even manage to pass something so obvious
@mitchellreports @realDonaldTrump Hard to believe they think people besides his base will buy an obviously doctored video
@amyewalter @NewsHour We all miss her
@mitchellreports @realDonaldTrump Disgusting show
@KyleClark Will be interesting the track our new governor takes on these issues
@KyleClark @RepMikeCoffman How far we've fallen.
@SenatorCollins @jaketapper Wonder how many of your caucus agree
@AMarch4OurLives Have to keep up the fight
@chrisvanderveen Spineless legislators are to blame
Every member of congress should be forced to watch the anguish on that poor father's face and voice who lost his son in the shooting then explain why stronger responsible gun regulations are a bad idea.
@idsnews And another season arises.
@PreetBharara We have to hope you are right.
@EricHolder @staceyabrams All about voter suppression and no accident
@KyleClark Actually I think it calls for a dash
@EricHolder We just might see about that.  The slippery slide seems to be getting slipperier
@jeremyjojola Bottoms up
@JeffFlake Any bets on that?
@JeffFlake @ChrisCoons Can't imagine your former comrades will allow it.  Cowled cowards they are.
@CoreyRoseTV @GShapiro9News A real pro for sure
@thehill Been coming a long time.
@MileHighReport A coaching staff that can think beyond the end of their noses would help.  So would a decent left tackle.
@MileHighReport The coach needs to dust off his resume.
@EricHolder @staceyabrams Purposeful and in itself voter suppression.
@amyewalter Analysts typically look in wrong places
@girlsreallyrule @staceyabrams Sounds like a pretty slimy one
@ktumulty Good idea when Mr T does the same
@washingtonpost We should ban the stuff from the shelves
@thehill That would be a first
@MileHighReport A coach who knows what he's doing would help
@Zapuda @MileHighReport Penalties just another example of poor play
@Kind_Designs @MileHighReport So true... imagine what some of that $28M QB $$$ would look like with a real backside tackle.  Oh forgot, he's a 1st rounder.
@Tex915 @MileHighReport Uh, you really just figuring that out.
@MikeDeCicco @MileHighReport Given the results so hard to imagine they are.  If so reason enough to fire the lot.
@RyanUltraMan @MileHighReport Under coaching can be worse than no coach.
@NBArigged @MileHighReport Wow... up yours on very first play.
@BadOne88 @MileHighReport Not sure under describes it.
@MileHighReport When it gets down to it bad teams just figure out a way to lose.
@MileHighReport Join the club
@NYTScience A total joke and these are the guys supposed to be looking out for us.
@business @bopinion How cool would that be.
@NBCNews @NBCNightlyNews Inexplicable it's still open
@JaclynCorin Make it happen
@RealMuckmaker Might be even worse than '68 - '72
@MileHighReport Mediocrity from top to bottom is the problem.
@adamcbest @NewtownAction Follow the money
@thehill Would seem to make sense
@CNNTonight @CNN Mike "Who" was in town and claimed he's a big deal too.  He needs to google "history of vice presidents
@colbertlateshow @missb62 Only fact check cares... his base sure as hell doesn't
@HuffPost Cold blooded politics
@CNNPolitics Hmmm... a choice?
@thehill Hope she runs in 2020... would make it interesting
@jeremyjojola BTW... Daniel is my hero.  :)
@jeremyjojola Me too.  Agree on robotics series and the foundation series so hopeful and inspiring.
@Right_Not_Wrong @KyleClark A fact if they pull out.
@nexton9news Might be a stretch
Just finished voting.  A typical bipartisan result, something I believe strongly in.  No party can be trusted with total control.  Essence of our democracy.
@WILSONNELDA @Taryn55717819 @EricHolder Vote the kids in!
@Taryn55717819 @EricHolder @WILSONNELDA A fact on both sides and will continue unless voters step up and hold them accountable
@EricHolder Can't let it happen
@RealMuckmaker Critical dems win house to stop it.
@SenSchumer It's all about the voting record... no excuses
@SenSchumer Any bets on that?
@KyleClark Hmmm...
@KyleClark Not all too sure Mr. C could ever be called a liberal.  But alas we live in a world that demands total and unconditional loyalty.  For us history buffs it reminds one of Joe Stalin in the ole USSR.   :)
@KyleClark Nice work
@KyleClark Question Kyle... why would you want it to go quicker.  Slower means more ale!
@KyleClark What's wrong with beer?
@KylieBearseWX You da man Steve!
@SocialPowerOne1 Used to think better of this guy.  Makes you wonder what dirt Mr. T has on him.  :)
@ESanders_10 BTW... YOU THE MAN NOW THAT 88 IS GONE.  STEP UP AND HONOR HIS MEMORY!
@ESanders_10 I decided to be a guy with boobs
@KyleClark Was mayor Mike there?
@SenSchumer A lie for sure.
@chucktodd I think social media could evolve to something better.  Remember stories of yellow journalism in late 19th century
@davidhogg111 YOU ARE THE FUTURE.  USE IT SMARTLY!
@jeremyjojola Love 'em both.  I add Isaac Asimov
@alexwagner @missb62 Inspiring speech she gave
@thehill Too bad you are leaving.  Need to dig in and fight to save honest conservatism
KUDOS TO ALL THOSE YOUNG PEOPLE WHO ARE VOTING.  KEEP IT UP... YOU ARE OUR HOPE AND FUTURE.
@EricHolder BTW... more gun laws may not be the answer but harsh mandated unnegotiable  penalties might be
@EricHolder These are body blows at the heart of our democracy
@MileHighReport A 4th losing season next year and maybe he couldn't be elected governor
@ESanders_10 @DemaryiusT Gonna miss 88.  One of the good guys
@TaRhondaThomas Dazzling as always
@KyleClark @GovofCO I'm more worried about Kansans
@KyleClark Our beagle snagged a peanut butter sandwich the other day
@SocialPowerOne1 Totally irresponsible suggestion
@KyleClark Sad but true... the most dangerous thing in our politics selective partisan tunnel vision and it's not a monopoly on one side
@JaclynCorin Way to go!  Thank you.
@JeffFlake Cold blooded heartless bully.  So embarrassing
@TomSteyer @realDonaldTrump @CNNSotu And the surprise is... ?
@EricHolder We can only hope
@chucktodd Might as well talk to a brick wall.  A well stoked fire is the goal
@amyewalter Hey me too!
@JudicialWatch @TomFitton @realDonaldTrump Give it a rest.  But alas the conspiracy to smear Mueller failed, so...
@MikeKlis @9NEWSSports Did about the best they could.  So sad to see him go.  Reality of a tough business.
@KyleClark @WalkerStapleton Wish he had voiced regret for the ridiculous ad about Polis as a woman abuser
One republican willing to stand for what is right https://t.co/I1SA6JPXNr
@RepMikeCoffman Thank you for calling him out
@SenGillibrand He's not afraid at all but sees it as a winning argument with his base he can inflame
We have a serial liar for a President.  Way to go America. https://t.co/ODFVo5jfna
#KeepKyleClarkGlad to hear about beer instead of Wash nonsense
@RealMuckmaker It's a scam alright
@RealMuckmaker Good
@FoxNews @JeffFlake Totally agree.  Very worrisome.
@politico Down that low are we?
@amyewalter Not sure if I was a woman I would want to trick or treat in a sexy outfit.
@NBCNews Kind of get it but really...?
@MileHighReport Another goof...?
@nexton9news It's over kill.  Has already been tried or adjudicated.  A form of double jeopardy if you ask me.
@politico Not according to Trump and the Trumpets... all about him.
@KyleClark Much ado about nothing.  Really folks... see it this way we could have Cruz or McConnell
@SocialPowerOne1 Right unless he commits a real crime.  Could be another Demo overreach if they try
@RepPerlmutter @realDonaldTrump Dang he and they must have forgotten.  Too busy kicking it up with the rapper.
@thehill Man crush
@ESanders_10 Hope you feel yourself and step it up on Sunday.  :)
@KellyO @missb62 Glad to see our president is hard at work.  Any bets when Taylor Swift will get an invite?
@washingtonpost Welcome to Washington
@EricHolder Typical republican move.  Remember though they learned the tactic from the good ole southern democratic party.
@MileHighReport @IanStClair Might have overpaid Keenum and goofed on Talib
@MileHighReport Looked bush league.
@KyleClark All Stapleton has is he's anti-oil and a big spender.
@thehill Dreamer...
@TubbsShow Couldn't wait to hear it
@MikeKlis Why would he be.  The fans are a rougher go.
@politico No you simply suppressed his right to speak and represent himself
@SpaceX NASA needs to play catch up to be in the game.
@KyleClark Should have been.  Embarrassing.  Allowing over 300 yards on the ground ridiculous.
@RedTRaccoon She caved
@MileHighReport Let's face it the guy is 7 - 14 and just got manhandled by the Jets for God's sakes.
@thecjpearson Bullshit.  The millenium long assault on women is over.

@Karoli @missb62 I sure as hell am.
@SocialPowerOne1 Ate you bleeping kidding me!!!  Disgusting.
@CReppWx Great shot
@SenatorCollins You should be concerned since it's basically your caucus who has pulled the rug out from under him
@SenatorCollins Can only hope it helps a little.  Regulatory limits on price gouging however is the real answer.
@AngrierWHStaff So little principle in DC
@SenatorCollins I agree.  Wondering about her agenda if she refuses.
#heynext Way to finally join the gender revolution Kyle!
@K8_Waters If it involves attempted rape you should
@LisaMoo14 I apologize for men everywhere.  Shameful
@SenFeinstein Not sure it rises to level of FBI investigation
@SenatorCollins Sound advice
@EricHolder Amazing abuse of political power in midst of an investigation
@SenFeinstein Where is she now?  Might she have been intimidated?
@EricHolder he can't stand the attention not on him
@amyewalter could even energize the other side
@amyewalter So sad that our politics are even penetrating athletic events.
@KyleClark @chucktodd @WalkerStapleton Of course... without that base he's dead in the water
@SenFeinstein Court nominees never give straight answers for fear of being pushed into a corner down the line
@realDonaldTrump A shame too that a sitting president can simply lie out his teeth.
@RedTRaccoon Talk about fake news.  Doesn't get much more fakey.
@SenatorCollins Now this is something our representatives should be digging into
@EricHolder Can't just assume somebody else will vote for you
@SocialPowerOne1 Boy that's a great use of time and tax dollars
@chucktodd The modern way to debate.
@KyleClark Ain't that the truth.  Guess Nike wrote off the Trumpets and super patriots.
@CReppWx This weekend!
@JeffFlake Always tough
@SenSanders All true
@SenatorCollins @jaketapper @CNNSotu Passing of more than just a simple senator.
@Aunt_Muu_Muu @ElmaWI @SenFeinstein That's different than "can't be" an fact is indicting  a P would be a huge blow.
@nexton9news Way too drastic
@nexton9news Seems like a bit of an overreach to me.
@KyleClark @ChristineNoelTV Had some of that on an Icelandair flight a few years ago.  Good stuff.
@TaRhondaThomas We sure miss you!
@SenSanders Why should we be surprised.
@MileHighReport Go with Kelly but keep options open
@sofiewhitney WAY TO GO!  GO TREAT YOURSELF.  :)
@SenSchumer I'm sure the high minded DEMS would
@maydaymindy9 What presidential mouthpiece ever has?
@Marshall9News @9NEWS @BrandonRittiman Got a tradition to uphold.  No stress there?
@amyewalter I agree.  Too many assumptions by Ds.  Rs will be far more energized by perceived wins by administration than being given credit for
@davidhogg111 Not so much fear as anxiety
@SenatorCollins @DoleFoundation Meanwhile the Trumpets are pulling regulations that protect military families from predatory banks
@SenSchumer @SenBobCorker Very true statement.  Dangerous precedents being set
@nexton9news Proves the wealthy aren't always selfish
@KyleClark @SenCoryGardner Why attack - his president is a member of his party.
@KyleClark You bet they would
@nexton9news They screwed up
@nexton9news I agree very poorly timed move.
@SenGillibrand Sorry but to him your party loyalty makes you the enemy.
Couldn't agree more.  Tired of the same old screaming on both sides.
@SenSanders Maybe we should start by recognizing university president greed.
@SenSchumer @realDonaldTrump @nytimes No doubt here.
@notpeterstrzok @LisaMoo14 Treated unfairly unless proved his bias affected his work.
@CRobertBuchanan @KyleClark @WalkerStapleton @csgazette @9NEWS It's fair game Kyle if the guy uses reference to him himself.
@chucktodd All typical of a bully.
@SocialPowerOne1 Get real!
@87ed @RossTuckerNFL @SiriusXMNFL When you get charged hard earned money to watch you have the right to boo.
@davidhogg111 Do the dirty work.
@nexton9news Heck let's blame it on Trump
@SenSchumer No, it's just politics as usual.  They got the votes.
@SenFeinstein You know maybe he just didn't.
@TaRhondaThomas We already miss you.
@davidhogg111 Keep it up... we need energized passionate young folks like you.
@9NEWS Why don't you jackasses work on something that actually helps the American people?
@CBSDenver Hard to imagine he could be any worse
@DanRather @Barbara80014143 He'd give a damn if they were happening in red states
@EdwardTHardy @Barbara80014143 Shocking
@Acosta @Eamt52 @StephenAtHome @realDonaldTrump That would be naive. The enemy just could be sitting in the White House.
@Eamt52 @SenatorCollins @tina41014747 A point of fact to be made madam
@SenatorCollins Absolutely true.
@RedTRaccoon What a waste of money
@davidhogg111 @GOP You got it figured out dude.
@amyewalter Follow the math but keep close tabs on the money this fall
@EricHolder My bet is they side on protecting the boss at all cost
@amyewalter Interesting.
@SenFeinstein Absolutely is partisan nonsense just like obstructing efforts to find common ground for dreamers.
@davidhogg111 Get out the vote!
@ABC He should be the death penalty and burned at the stake.
@CBSEveningNews YOU'VE GOT TO BE F....G KIDDING ME!!
@nexton9news Guess what, they are cowards and won't.
@SenatorCollins @NASA Amazing but typical they've never received them.
@SenGillibrand Maybe it's just because you are a woman who can't count on men to stand up for them.
@ndrew_lawrence This is disgusting!
@SenSchumer Obnoxious example of the blatant racist tribalism of the Trump administration.
@SenFeinstein We are in the midst of a regressive era.
@SenSchumer @realDonaldTrump Wish I knew why that is.
@TaRhondaThomas Good luck.  You'll be missed.
@RepSwalwell This is true
@SenFeinstein Think they are just being obstructive, something they are good at.
@CSP_News Prayers for him
@KyleClark Had I known where I would have dropped by.  Gosh, we could talk football.
@DanRather He's a tethered hack.
@SenSchumer Why would we be surprised.
@SenFeinstein Of course they do.  Makes a person think they have something to hide
@SocialPowerOne1 Strange... he called him a great American only a few months agi
@neiltyson Neil, we are wondering how you explain that the universe grew by several light years in a second when in Einstein's theory says matter can't travel faster than light.
@DanRather Well said.  Time for the republican wimps to step up for their country
@thehill And people still listen and think this moron is credible
@lrozen @missb62 I have no problem with that.  He has the right.
@FoxNews @POTUS Sure didn't shirk from saying the EU was an adversary
@joncoopertweets At least somebody is finally waking up to reality
@KyleClark Way too normal dude
@mitchellreports We have for sure... doesn't make it okay
@amyewalter How true is this!  An amazing contradiction even for politicians well schooled in the skill.
@SenatorCollins Maybe you should inform your president
@AltUSPressSec @LisaMoo14 Sure as hell would have tried and maybe with Congress in their court she would have been impeached
@bridget_joy_ She's only doing her job
@Bornabrit1 @Learning2GetBy Interesting parallel
@WorldAndScience Cool
@JasonHalle Probably not.  Looked more like a test run that had little real impact
@peterdaou Dangerous to a democracy to attack the independent press regardless their opinion
@SenFeinstein I'm not sure these guys will do that.  They may chip at the edges and make it harder though
@SenSchumer Intent on gutting UCA as a handout to the insurance industry
@ScottMinton31 @Archie_Miller High hopes
@SenGillibrand Are you sure about that?
@SenFeinstein Confirmed him anyway.  Gutless republicans
@amyewalter He would have vilified her
@Bjorn12650 @KyleClark They don't... damn!
@KyleClark Keep trying harder.
@davidhogg111 Once would have believed that to be a given.  But you being a radical terrorist it must now be considered fake news.
@thecjpearson Not a great banner example for gun regulation that's for sure.  Maybe other issues involved...?
@RedTRaccoon Guliani's an ass
@SenSchumer All about killing the Holy Grail no matter the cost
@nexton9news People like that on both sides are idiots
@amyewalter He would have called her a terrorist
@SenatorCollins About time
@nexton9news @Noeltbrennan @CorkyScholl A quiet hero!
@SenGillibrand Here's a crazy solution - maybe men should abstain on women exclusive issues.
@Emma4Change Way to go!
@Archie_Miller Excited about coming year
@CReppWx They were on top of it
@mommamia1217 @Learning2GetBy This is a highly disturbing stat for those who cherish democracy.
@TomSteyer This is the real consequence of a truly ineffective presidential candidate in '16
@MichaelAvenatti Easier said than done.  They didn't have the votes.
@mitchellreports The assault on discovering the truth continues.
@SenFeinstein Was still on the right side of the ledger 80% of the time.
What idiots the Ds who are calling to abolish ICE.  All they are doing is give the Trumpets an issue to energize over
@neiltyson Of course all news and pictures of space are conspiatorial fake news
@SocialPowerOne1 This is just plain wrong.
@amyewalter Just shows how low our politics have gotten.  But remember that Tom Jefferson once accused John Adams of being a hermaphrodite.
@EricHolder Fanatics is an apt description
@neiltyson The end of critical thinking could be near
@SenSchumer Trump truly has made lying an art at the highest level
@SenGillibrand Gee, wonder where they got that line from?
@SenSchumer Either way and I do agree what he did cost her the election it was inappropriate.
@SenFeinstein The lying never stops
Want to learn a few things about WW2, check out my book about my father in law on Amazon. com.  The title is " Flying the B-17 Flying Fortress:  The memories and experiences of 1st Lieutenant Clayton Nattier.
@SenSchumer Bought and paid for they are.
@SenFeinstein That's for sure.
@USMC_Resistance So you just lowered yourself to the idiot's level.
@SenSchumer That's a no brainer.
@TheRynheart @Learning2GetBy @NRA Wanna bet they get it done?
@calbertcheaney Sad day for both the IU and U of Colorado families.
@Marshall9News @MayorHancock Sounds like pretty typical gov't. efficiency.
@SenSchumer Fair trade laws should have zero sum value as their goal - win win for both sides.
Less government intrusion, job creation, sensible tax reform not just screaming about the rich, health and medical cost relief, common sense immigration policy, infrastructure would be good starts. https://t.co/TXCyE9qdHZ
@pategarrett @Stonekettle @charles_gaba Dems need to start talking about things that directly effect everyday Americans who are hurting and frustrated.
@SocialPowerOne1 Maybe we should call them mass murder with an f....g gun
@politico If there is suspicion that illegality may be happening isn't it part of the FBIs job to investigate with maybe an informant?  Just asking?
@LaceyW1981 @politico I guess I don't know much either.
@SenGillibrand @PPact An end run through executive action meant to seal the deal with evangelicals.
@NPR Just one more of many sad blows to workers since the demise of the union movement.
I agree... a totally independent and unintimidated free judiciary is an essential key to democracy. https://t.co/i3lL8SfhIr
@MileHighReport If he does Lynch is done in Denver and maybe the NFL
@Society4Science Somebody needs to tell the Repubicans
@SenateGOP I guess having free access to the internet isn't nearly as important as having access to guns.
Want to talk and know about World War II?  My dad served on Guam and my father in law was a POW in Germany.  Let's share information.
@nexton9news They are here at Marston Lake
@magziesb @Barbara80014143 Votes always make a difference no matter the result.
@nexton9news @KyleClark We should all pull our support and let it die a merciful death and damn the hedge fund owners so a better replacement can appear.
@thehill What an absolute idiot
Bear Valley's #1 Hoosier fan. https://t.co/1Im0m3rySF
@neiltyson Bigger yet... when did it become okay to hate another for their politics?  I have lots of friends who both love and hate Trump.  Makes it fun and exciting.
@RyanHillMI @cameron_kasky @Emma4Change @realDonaldTrump Why would he.  The man had no gun and is the wrong color.
@Master_of_Cre @HuffPost To hear the NRA talk you would think it was them.
@insidethehall NICE!
@nexton9news Good for Mr. Krieger for standing up for what's right.
@KyleClark Our 200 year old labor based economy is coming to an end.  In 50 years we will need a new model or face 50% unemployment.
@HuffPost How ironic is that!
@thehill I think they do.  Can't sink to Trump's level.
@RedTRaccoon Two wrongs don't make a right.  Gotta get above the pit being created by Mr T
@neiltyson When we decided to identify ourselves and each other by our politics
@SenBennetCO Hope the politicos were listening
@politico What a joke.
@SocialPowerOne1 Sure... let's turn that into a political football.
@ZLucky77 @archurops @HarrisonMJ1967 @MikeKlis Speed is sometimes over rated.  Separation and route management are far more important.
@PoliteMelanie And why would we be surprised?
@KyleClark Sorta wonder just how they are supposed to get that experience.
@SteveSchmidtSES Just one more example of how totally unqualified the man is to be president.
@politico They never stop wasting our money on political nonsense.
@SocialPowerOne1 He let it out of the closet and made bigots feel empowered.
@KyleClark Only the listened to be hated and scorned.  :)
@SenSchumer Support that.  Way more important fish to fry at the federal level.
@IndianaFootball @IUBArchives Actually raced there in 1970.  Got our butts kicked by the frat guys.
@WSJ @KarlRove Se'll make it better.
@9NEWS Really sad for those poor cops.  Killed just doing their jobs to serve and protect us.
@CNNPolitics Maybe if they stepped up and told him the truth it would end.
@politico @wuerker Fiscal responsibility has gone out the window with today's republican party.  No better than the dems.
@CNN I cheer them for stepping up.
@TubbsShow A true icon and treasure to our country
@washingtonpost Shows how bankrupt they after crying for years about Bill Clinton who also actually deserved it.

@thehill He or she needs to turn up the hearing aids..
@KyleClark Speak for yourself dude.
@SenSchumer @SenateMajLdr @realDonaldTrump Only reason for a bill is you can't trust the ethics of the current resident in the Oval Office.
@TPM No surprise there... a total wimp in Mr. T's back pocket.
@speechboy71 Sure as hell smart enough  to become president
@RedTRaccoon @missb62 Seems like an honest guy
@NPR Typical profiling...
@Amy_Siskind @missb62 Giuliani is a scum
@DENAirport @SGilmoreDist11 @Fly_Norwegian @MayorHancock Colonel Harvey is a true gentleman.
@robreiner Need to quit wishing for the end and work hard on new progressive positions and policies that address people's frustration and feeling ignored.  It's what got Mr. T elected in the first place.
@SenSchumer Nothing really that appropriate or useful in launching a billion dollars worth of missile to hurt a guy who doesn't care
@KyleClark Makes about as much sense as a lot of our current foreign policy.
@thehill Does anybody really still listen to this guy?
@60Minutes @CBSNews Is a few bucks saved worth taking your life in your hands?
@SenSchumer @TheJusticeDept @realDonaldTrump Like any crime syndicate boss total loyalty is essential thus he has every reason
@ProudResister Innocent people have no reason to attack?  Or is it a classic prize fighter who can't resist a good fight?
@KyleClark Sounds about right.  Bill 'em for your time.  :)
@davidhogg111 @elisabethlehem Hope Mr. Hogg and young people stay engaged.  Only 12% under 25 voted in 2016.  Imagine the difference had they?
@davidhogg111 Doesn't sound much like a radical to me.
@thehill Hate to agree with the guy but they and Putin are a danger
@TIME What the hell else would you call him.
Pruitt is the classic fox let loose in the chicken coop https://t.co/H4m6sKXfvv

@ohstephany_ Sadly it is because mass shootings have become so common place.
@thehill Hate to say it - but it's sorta true.  Way to rev up a d energize the other side.  No better way.

Find it hard to believe our president tells a Russian autocrat he had a great electoral victory while trashing a man (Mueller) who actually risked his life to serve his country with honor.
Hard for me to admit but I mostly agree with a lot of what Mr. T is proposing for the opioid criss.  Gotta have a combination of treatment and accountability
@KyleClark Remember 1987 Kyle?
@nexton9news Any bets these guys could end up filing for protection

@JeffFlake What if this is the classic political con job where he offers the huge negative followed by all the exceptions then can ultimately say and brag he went after Chinese

@KyleClark Sad day for an iconic part of Denver history
@johnelway @casekeenum7 Good move to not fall into the trap of chasing the over hype
Now that the bright flame has gone out who will take up the torch of knowledge
@RepMikeCoffman Mike as I respect you as a sincere member of congress I find your position on guns indefensible and totally tied to the NRA.
@KyleClark Newspapers are doomed.  A sad reality
Sad day for the world https://t.co/GnSk0tyYat

@KyleClark Ridiculous... if we really believed this needs to stop we would force him to resign.  Only then by making firm examples of empowered guys like him can we prove we are ready to move on and give women the respect they deserve.
Americans deserve to know what happened and how deep it went https://t.co/tQlkSkiK9y

@RepMikeCoffman @POTUS @realDonaldTrump @DeptVetAffairs @SecShulkin The entire veterans affairs admin needs to go.  It's a travesty to all veterans
@9NEWS What are we calling affordable housing?
@KyleClark Maybe the classiest guy in Mr. Ts administration to date
@USATODAY 2 very powerful women
@Reuters More political nonsense
@WorldAndScience Just the name itself makes it sound cool
@HuffPost Maybe somebody reminded Mr. T who gave him $50M during the campaign
@TheWeirdWorld Ain't this the truth
@ABC It's easier to pretend there's no problem than work to fix it.  Falls right into classic kick the can down the road scenario

No surprise Trumpy bent to the will of the NRA
@Marshall9News @DenverFOP27 Who should be surprised the disfunctional Denver Sheriff department screwed the pooch again
Here's my priorities... live well. love my wife and support her. live healthy. have fun, do good, help others, help the environment, care about politics.
Better get out and get that new car before the tariffs hit.  Will soon cost from 15 to 20% more.  Thanx Mr. T
Are we to truly believe the NKs will ever give up their nukes?  Not sure I'd bet a lot on that meeting ever happening.
Typical politics in Colo. state house.  Neither side has any real credibility
